Most of the places I have found letterboxes are places that I would not have thought to go otherwise.  As long as it is not harming the environment I don't know why you have to be like that.  If you agree with the National Parks then don't place or find boxes there.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am curious as to why you feel it is your responsibility <br/>
to contact the NPS? If this boxer is willing to place a <br/>
box here, I would think it their decision. Years ago, I <br/>
placed a box on NPS property in AZ, long before it was <br/>
known to be against policy. Just recently, I was contacted <br/>
by a ranger from the park who had confiscated it. He was <br/>
quite amiable, even signing into the log before he returned <br/>
it to me. Dozens of boxers had signed into it in the <br/>
three years plus that it lived in the wild.<br/>
<br/>
I left this box in place even after I learned of Park Service <br/>
policy against caches and letterboxes. I had decided that <br/>
as long as it was left undiscovered by the powers that be, <br/>
it was bringing pleasure to my fellow boxers. I knew that <br/>
my hiding place was not in an environmentally sensitive <br/>
area and that the box was easy enough to find that no <br/>
damage would be done in the search. I also never left <br/>
another box on NPS property once I knew the rules but <br/>
left this one alone. <br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would certainly refrain from tattling to the <br/>
park service. My ranger was the friendly sort but some <br/>
are not. Would you want to expose a fellow boxer, who <br/>
provided you with a log to sign, to possible litigation and<br/>
large fines? I think your personal email would be sufficient. <br/>
Don't hide boxes of your own in National Parks and let the <br/>
box owners decide for themselves... Funhog<br/>

  Something just desn't seem right about this post.  Perhaps it really is just someone trying to stir things up. But:<br/>
<br/>
  ~ These 2 particular boxes have no clues or info. <br/>
  ~ You signed in? Why?<br/>
  ~This member joined the group YESTERDAY. <br/>
  ~Look at the names of the box ID under the links.<br/>

I'll be on the lookout for him at other lists.  These people tend to<br/>

amusement.<br/>

Also, I've also had very good experiences working directly with park<br/>
rangers.   In fact, the only cranky people I've encountered at parks<br/>
are those who leave weird notes about how the box is illegal, not<br/>
realizing that the park rangers approved, off the record.<br/>

folks are proud of their boxes and the logs are unique &amp; <br/>

I was kinda thinking the same thing.  Isn't it rather hypocritcal to sign in<br/>
and then complain about the box locations?  What would Ms. Manners say?<br/>

Something just desn't seem right about this post.  Perhaps it really is just<br/>
someone trying to stir things up. But:<br/>
<br/>
~ These 2 particular boxes have no clues or info. <br/>
~ You signed in? Why?<br/>
~This member joined the group YESTERDAY. <br/>

Well, joke or not, I put the names in and came up with boxes.  Don't <br/>
forget, you can't simply click on the link.  The names of the boxes are <br/>
segmented and need to be pasted into a web browser together.<br/>
<br/>
Fake or real, I wouldn't even threaten to harm someone elses boxes.  No <br/>
matter what, but that's just me.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I stumbled across "Difficult Rock Troll" about two weeks ago which<br/>
&gt; was found at the Great Falls National Park, near Washington, D.C.<br/>
&gt; Signed log and replaced as found.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; "Difficult Rock Troll" http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br/>
&gt; boxnum=12923&amp;boxname=Difficult_Rock_Troll<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is also another letterbox nearby, "Paws for Thought"<br/>
&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br/>
&gt; boxnum=12856&amp;boxname=Paws_for_Thought_-_Difficult_Run<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both owners have been contacted to let them know it is illegal to<br/>
&gt; place letterboxes in National Parks.  I've yet to receive a response<br/>
&gt; from either owner.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These owners need to remove these letterboxes, or I will contact a<br/>
&gt; GFNP ranger to remove them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

The boxes could have been placed with permission. You wouldn't <br/>

do you want to be the one to remove them and possibly be caught with <br/>

I don't agree with placing on NPS land because we know it's a no-no <br/>

&gt; Hello Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I'm sorry, this is not a joke.  I see it as a poor situation for <br/>

&gt; play by the rules, we endanger our chances of the NPS allowing the <br/>
&gt; use of their property in the future.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I'm not threatening anyone's boxes.  I'm simply asking these <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; be moved before the NPS becomes aware of their location.  I know <br/>
&gt; folks are proud of their boxes and the logs are unique &amp; <br/>

<br/>
Please do not overreact to either the angry responses you receive, <br/>
nor the situation at hand.  There is a level of appropriateness to <br/>
everything.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you stop officers in the street to point out litterers?  Please <br/>
match the reaction to the harm.  <br/>
<br/>
The actual law does not state that letterboxes or geocaches are <br/>
illegal.  The law says that letterboxes and geocaches must be <br/>
approved by the park commander. The few letterboxes I know of that <br/>
have been pulled and cited have specifically not cited an anti-<br/>
letterboxing law, because there is no such law.  They are only able <br/>
to cite the law against "abandoned property".  In reality there is a <br/>
lot of "don't ask don't tell" going on here.  <br/>
<br/>
Every once in a while a letterbox is identified and pulled and cited <br/>
by an over enthusiastic NPS employee.  Most do not go looking when <br/>
they see no harm.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the NPS, like any organization, must protect its property <br/>
and its rights from 'potential' abuse.  When they are prodded, they <br/>
must react.  When a letterbox is placed that is damaging sensitive <br/>
natural or historic areas it should be removed.  Out in ordinary <br/>
woods, with no sensitive wildlife or history, it is doing no harm. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of NPS land is historically or environmentally sensitive.  But <br/>
a lot looks like any woods in someone's back yard.  The rule has to <br/>
protect the sensitive but be flexible enough to not overreact.   <br/>
<br/>
Write the owners and tell them you think it is a bad idea.  They may <br/>
not even know that it is NPS land.  But if the NPS were concerned <br/>
about a few boxes and caches, they are perfectly capable of doing <br/>
something about them themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think it is just plain safer and saner to avoid NPS <br/>
property altogether.<br/>

Thank you both for your input.  I'm glad someone has posted a <br/>
rational argument.<br/>
<br/>
I disagree with you on the legality of being in a cemetery at night.  <br/>
It depends on which state and county you are in.  For example Virgina <br/>
Code states:<br/>
<br/>
http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-125<br/>
 18.2-125. Trespass at night upon any cemetery. <br/>
<br/>
If any person, without the consent of the owner, proprietor or <br/>
custodian, go or enter in the nighttime, upon the premises, property, <br/>
driveways or walks of any cemetery, either public or private, for any <br/>
purpose other than to visit the burial lot or grave of some member of <br/>
his family, he shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. <br/>
<br/>
(Code 1950,  18.1-181; 1960, c. 358; 1975, cc. 14, 15.) <br/>
<br/>
So this leaves us with the one good question:<br/>
Are letterboxes permitted on NPS property or not??  I've heard a <br/>
couple of weak arguments that some have been permitted, it's up to <br/>
the local superintendant, they don't hurt anything so leave them be, <br/>
etc &amp; etc.  Nothing concrete.<br/>
<br/>
Can someone find the law or policy regarding this?  Please cite your <br/>
sources.  I'd like to clarify this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

 Mitch,<br/>
Since you did not respond to my point contained in post #51047,and <br/>
could not give me a rational argument, I redirect you back to that <br/>
post. Discussion regarding placement of letterboxes on NPS property <br/>
is moot. The Placer has control over the clues,Letterbox and editing <br/>
of clues. You should check archives concerning this discussion prior <br/>
to bringing this subject up again as it has been visited and <br/>
revisited many times. Actually ANY letterbox placed could be <br/>
considered trash unless approval for it's placement is received, and <br/>
that would make placing most letterboxes a violation of the law.<br/>
You started this thread by indicating that you were planing on <br/>
contacting NPS authorities, but instead brought the subject up again <br/>
here and brought it up at the geocache list as well. I tend to go <br/>
along with what most geocachers have told you "Mind your own <br/>
business". Rarely do I agree with the geocaching community, but in <br/>
this instance I agree with them completely.<br/>
If you do wish to insert your nose into some other person's business <br/>
please do so, rather than belaboring it and continuing this thread.<br/>
I think we are all aware that NPS doesn't want placement of <br/>
letterboxes on "our" land that they control, so if you are looking <br/>
for some pat on the back for bringing this to our attention, I <br/>
believe you will be disappointed. As stated before EACH letterboxer <br/>
has full responsibility for their letterboxes, and they have the <br/>
liability for that placement.<br/>

Remember what happened a little over 200 years ago (we<br/>

really don't need you to interpret them for us.  You<br/>
deal with Parliament ,where your opinion matters.  Let<br/>
us deal with the NPS.  They enforce the laws that WE,<br/>
as Americans, put into action.  Maybe you should worry<br/>
a little more about things that apply to you.  For<br/>
example, a national dental plan for England would be a<br/>
good place to start and then maybe you could work on<br/>
the whole "driving on the wrong side of the road"<br/>
issue.  Apparently you've got nothing better to do<br/>
than try to help US understand OUR laws.  Like we need<br/>
the help from a red coat.   <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">fyi.  The casual visitor to Difficult Run would not know that they <br/>
are on NPS property.  The nearest parking lot is operated by a local <br/>
park, not the NPS.  From there you walk onto NPS property with no <br/>
obvious signage indicating the boundary.  The placers probably have <br/>
no idea they placed on NPS land.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the boxes is very primitive.  The placer has not placed any <br/>
other boxes.  They probably tried out the hobby and have moved on.  <br/>
You will probably never hear from them.  <br/>
<br/>
The other probably does not check their e-mail often.  I assume it <br/>
is not very well hidden because you found it accidently.  A well <br/>
hidden box is not accidently found.  (Except maybe by geocachers.  <br/>
They turn over every rock because they don't have clear directions.)<br/>
<br/>
Neither appear to be in sensitive areas or doing any harm.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, before I make someone else's business my business (which <br/>
I do on occasion) I first ask myself, "Are they doing harm that <br/>
warrants me inserting myself into the situation?" <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you both for your input.  I'm glad someone has posted a <br/>
&gt; rational argument.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I disagree with you on the legality of being in a cemetery at <br/>
night.  <br/>
&gt; It depends on which state and county you are in.  For example <br/>
Virgina <br/>
&gt; Code states:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+18.2-125<br/>
&gt;  18.2-125. Trespass at night upon any cemetery. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If any person, without the consent of the owner, proprietor or <br/>
&gt; custodian, go or enter in the nighttime, upon the premises, <br/>
property, <br/>
&gt; driveways or walks of any cemetery, either public or private, for <br/>
any <br/>
&gt; purpose other than to visit the burial lot or grave of some member <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; his family, he shall be guilty of a Class 4 misdemeanor. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Code 1950,  18.1-181; 1960, c. 358; 1975, cc. 14, 15.) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So this leaves us with the one good question:<br/>
&gt; Are letterboxes permitted on NPS property or not??  I've heard a <br/>
&gt; couple of weak arguments that some have been permitted, it's up to <br/>
&gt; the local superintendant, they don't hurt anything so leave them <br/>
be, <br/>
&gt; etc &amp; etc.  Nothing concrete.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can someone find the law or policy regarding this?  Please cite <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; sources.  I'd like to clarify this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Best response here so far.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I can cite at least 5 geocaches on NPS property with permission.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We're from South Carolina and since this nasty legislation came <br/>
up <br/>
&gt; &gt; we've been doing a LOT of research on various laws.  There are a <br/>
&gt; lot <br/>
&gt; &gt; of misconceptions concerning some laws that some think are <br/>
common <br/>
&gt; &gt; knowledge.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Illegal to be in a cemetery at night?  Nope.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Must be a family member to legally visit a cemetery? Nope.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Illegal to place a cache or box on NPS or USF&amp;WS land?  Only if <br/>
&gt; it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; not authorized.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Oh, well, the battle rages on.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; CR<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; PS: Maybe the FAQ should be changed to reflect the true nature <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; placing boxes on a NPS land?  (You can just about forget getting <br/>
&gt; &gt; authorization on USF&amp;WS land unless you can show the box <br/>
furthers <br/>
&gt; &gt; wildlife conservation somehow.)  It would reduce the "FAQ <br/>
thumpers" <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; little.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The actual law does not state that letterboxes or geocaches <br/>
are <br/>

<br/>
Just received a response from the owner of the Letterbox at Great <br/>
Falls National Park. The owner has graciously offered to move the box <br/>
and retire the listing for it, as they were not aware that the box <br/>
was located on NPS property. I applaud their decision. <br/>
<br/>
There is a second box nearby on NPS property, but due to the <br/>
responses I've received on this subject, the best course of action <br/>
would be to allow this thread to close and take no further action. <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing and Geocaching are under fire in South Carolina at this <br/>
time. The right thing to do now is to put our best foot forward and <br/>
shine a positive light on our combined hobbies. Hopefully, geocaching <br/>
and letterboxing may permitted on NPS land sometime in the future. <br/>
<br/>
I want to thank EVERYONE for their opinions, whether or not I agree <br/>
with them.  I've carefully weighed each response that was received on <br/>
this thread, and it appears to be a delicate subject for most people. <br/>
I'd also like to take this opportunity to apologize if I've offended <br/>
anyone.<br/>

Her Ladyship is so sorry for her untimely reply to your query. Her<br/>
Ladyship was off on holiday for the weekend and only just returned.<br/>
What to say, indeed? Quite a lot of fuss wouldn't you say? One<br/>
certainly can't fault someone for taking the morally correct path.<br/>
Laws are there for the common good after all. There is an epidemic of<br/>
moral relativism in this culture. Remember that Justice is blind and<br/>
failure to apply the law equally and without regard to subjective<br/>
factors or situational ethics will destroy your legitimacy and right<br/>
to govern and enforce the law. To that end, her Ladyship has sent Mr.<br/>
Run's e-mail confession to the appropriate authorities in the NPS and<br/>
informed them that he admits he was the last person to have these<br/>
letterboxes in his possession and that he admits placing these boxes<br/>
on NPS property in knowing violation of the law which he himself<br/>
subsequently quoted. Clearly a scofflaw, an example must be made of<br/>
this man. He found this object, took possession of it then with full<br/>
knowledge of the laws to the contrary placed it on NPS land, only to<br/>
later admit so publicly. Her Ladyship is not sure how his convoluted<br/>
logic works in the real world but can now rest assured that she has<br/>
not compromised her morally superior position and that the authorities<br/>
who are charged with enforcing the laws will do their duty.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You're right, of course.  I shouldn't have implied this is the case <br/>
everywhere.  In SC, the law states that if you enter an enclosed area <br/>
between the hours of 6pm and 6am, etc.  It's not specific to <br/>
cemeteries, but certainly includes them if they have a fence and gate.  <br/>

&gt; I disagree with you on the legality of being in a cemetery at night.  <br/>
&gt; It depends on which state and county you are in. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Thank you both for your input.  I'm glad someone has posted a <br/>
&gt; &gt; rational argument.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;  Mitch,<br/>
&gt; Since you did not respond to my point contained in post #51047,and <br/>
&gt; could not give me a rational argument, I redirect you back to that <br/>
&gt; post. Discussion regarding placement of letterboxes on NPS property <br/>
&gt; is moot. The Placer has control over the clues,Letterbox and <br/>
editing <br/>
&gt; of clues. You should check archives concerning this discussion <br/>
prior <br/>
&gt; to bringing this subject up again as it has been visited and <br/>
&gt; revisited many times. Actually ANY letterbox placed could be <br/>
&gt; considered trash unless approval for it's placement is received, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; that would make placing most letterboxes a violation of the law.<br/>
&gt; You started this thread by indicating that you were planing on <br/>
&gt; contacting NPS authorities, but instead brought the subject up <br/>
again <br/>
&gt; here and brought it up at the geocache list as well. I tend to go <br/>
&gt; along with what most geocachers have told you "Mind your own <br/>
&gt; business". Rarely do I agree with the geocaching community, but in <br/>
&gt; this instance I agree with them completely.<br/>
&gt; If you do wish to insert your nose into some other person's <br/>
business <br/>
&gt; please do so, rather than belaboring it and continuing this thread.<br/>
&gt; I think we are all aware that NPS doesn't want placement of <br/>
&gt; letterboxes on "our" land that they control, so if you are looking <br/>
&gt; for some pat on the back for bringing this to our attention, I <br/>
&gt; believe you will be disappointed. As stated before EACH letterboxer <br/>
&gt; has full responsibility for their letterboxes, and they have the <br/>
&gt; liability for that placement.<br/>
