but we all managed to avoid being captured in the act of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
The Nature Park celebrated Earth Day and we were included.  They gave us a<br/>
table to base our operation.  We had letterboxing info, 6 boxes hidden for<br/>
the event, and materials for making stamps (scratch foam glued to wood<br/>
blocks).  The event ran from 10 AM to 1 PM.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, the same event fell victim to bad weather, so we had more people<br/>
gathered around our table.  This year the weather was good so most everyone<br/>
was outside!  I met a new letterboxer early on.  She introduced herself, but<br/>
I am so bad with remembering names that I have forgotten!  Sorry!!!  Soon<br/>
after, Funhog showed up. She is so motivated!  We had a great time talking<br/>
shop for nearly the entire time.  We were then joined by another newbie,<br/>
A.Rose.  She also stayed with us for most of the time.  Then a surprise<br/>
visit from Jane &amp; Chris D'Silva and daughter Pamela.  Jane &amp; Chris came all<br/>
the way from Langley, BC, Canada!!  At about the same time Trudy C dropped<br/>
by with a friend and then the Plundering Bunny came and stayed for the rest<br/>
of the event.  We did get some actual letterboxing in after we abandoned our<br/>
table.<br/>
<br/>
It was cool to see how much the letterboxing community in this part of the<br/>
world has grown.  I was really enthused &amp; motivated.  Guess I'd better work<br/>
on my P&amp;F numbers!!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm already thinking about another letterboxing event for later this summer.<br/>
Something a LOT more covert, maybe more remote and participatory.<br/>
