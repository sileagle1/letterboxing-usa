Chuck, Molly,  &amp; Chickabirdee. We too thought we wouldn't be doing much<br/>
exchanging after attending a number of gatherings, but we were delighted to<br/>
meet 28 new boxers! And over 45 people stamped in our new traveller. Thanks<br/>
to everyone who wished us Bon Voyage ;-))<br/>
<br/>
We were also delighted to receive some beautiful carvings to take back to<br/>
New Zealand with us - thanks to Chuck, Leader of the Pack, Pat &amp; Amy, and<br/>
RTRW. We will also be at the mystery gathering too, so if anyone else would<br/>
like to contribute to populating a new country with boxes, please do! If you<br/>
miss us there, send us an email and we'll arrange something.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
