together to provide for a perfect summer day.  In southern New <br/>
England that special opportunity presents itself on a warm, sunny <br/>
afternoon at Ninigret Park, Charlestown, RI.  Ninigret has almost <br/>
everything one can want and it's all free!  Located right on the <br/>
Rhode Island coastline, Ninigret is a former Naval Air Station that <br/>
has been divided into a national wildlife refuge and town park.  <br/>
<br/>
When getting ready for a perfect summer day it's hard to decide<br/>
what <br/>
to pack.  Definitely include a bathing suit, roller blades, frisbee, <br/>
letterboxing pack, walking shoes, picnic dinner, sunscreen and bug <br/>
spray.  Optional equipment includes a bicycle, binoculars, tennis <br/>
racquet, basketball, kite; the list goes on  Don't forget<br/>
the kids <br/>
(I hear Carolyn Stearns is giving some away if you don't have any<br/>
of <br/>
your own) and all their paraphernalia.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to decide what to do first when you arrive.  You can try <br/>
your roller blades or ride your bike on the criterion course set on <br/>
old landing strips.  Play some tennis or basketball.  If there is a <br/>
breeze it is a perfect place to fly a kite.  Our version of a perfect <br/>
day begins with parking at the refuge and pursuing the easier of the <br/>
two DrewClan's Ninigret box.  On a warm summer day linger in the <br/>
cove, take off your shoes and go wading in the cool ocean waters.  In <br/>
August, after finding the box search for blueberries in the bushes <br/>
lining the trail on the way back to the parking lot.  Don't<br/>
forget to <br/>
check and see if the nature center is open when you return to the <br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
It's time to put on your bathing suit for a swim in Little<br/>
Ninigret <br/>
Pond.  It is a fresh water pond with a nice sandy beach where the <br/>
water remains clear even in August.  When you are ready for a break <br/>
put your shorts and shoes on and head for the discgolf course on the <br/>
other side of the pond.  Discgolf is an amazing sport that combines <br/>
frisbee and golf.  Did you know that there are almost 1000 discgolf <br/>
courses in the US alone?  This is one of only three in RI.  There are <br/>
usually loaner discs available at the start.  If you brought your own <br/>
frisbee be warned that competition discs are smaller, heavier and <br/>
will give you a distinct advantage.  Try your throw with this disc on <br/>
all nine holes.  Make sure that after you give your throw at the <br/>
fifth tee that you stop at the backside of the small wall immediately <br/>
in front of the red hydrant to carefully record your score and stamp <br/>
in the logbook.  When you are done with all nine don't forget to <br/>
return your disc to the box for the next person.<br/>
<br/>
As you return to the parking area send the kids to the wonderful <br/>
playground while you fire up the coals in one of the barbecue stands <br/>
under the pavilion.  As you are eating your dinner and enjoying the <br/>
setting sun be aware that there is even more to the perfect day ahead <br/>
of you.  While it is getting dark make sure to thoroughly dowse <br/>
everyone in bug spray.  The mosquitoes can be brutal at dusk.  Then <br/>
head over to the Frosty Drew observatory.  The observatory is run by <br/>
volunteers and paid for by donations.  On weekend evenings in the <br/>
summer it is open for viewing.  In addition, many of the volunteers <br/>
will bring their own telescopes and provide lots of great celestial <br/>
viewing and information.<br/>
<br/>
Your day complete, it is time to pack up the family and return home.  <br/>
On the drive back be sure to reflect on what a special place to spend <br/>
the "perfect summer day."<br/>
