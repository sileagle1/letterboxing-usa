Here are my thoughts ~ and I stress these are my thoughts and no one else has to like, dislike or even read them.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter in the least to me what someone does at a gathering, with their log book, how they collect images.  For me this isn't a competition (if it were I'd be dead last!) and what anyone else does, does not affect me, unless they are destroying letterboxes.   I letterbox for my own personal reasons in my own personal way.  Every one of us does the same.  As long as I am happy with my logbook, how you filled yours really isn't my concern.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that these are ink images on paper.  They are delightful little things to find and collect, but they are impermanent and in the grand scheme, minuscule in importance.  <br/>
<br/>
I know it is a futile wish, but I still do wish that we as a group could allow one another to enjoy this hobby in our own way, without feeling a need to attack and insult.  While some may enjoy the sport of that, it does hurt people's feelings and turns them away.  But then, perhaps that is what some people would prefer.<br/>
<br/>
So, once again ~ just my thoughts and opinions.  Attack away.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, in theory I would agree with most of what you said -- I don't <br/>
care how you count your stamps or fill your log book, heck for all I <br/>
care, you can (as PI says in his most recent anecdote) bring your <br/>
log book to the local stamp shop and fill the darn thing with images <br/>
from there.  But theory isn't always practical and there are a <br/>
couple things that don't sit right with me.<br/>
<br/>
As a letterboxer attending a gathering, perhaps travelling many <br/>
miles to get there, I think it is reasonable for me to expect that <br/>
one of the perks of my effort for going, besides meeting all the <br/>
cool letterboxing people who are made to look like tyrants on the <br/>
list, is that I will be privy to event stamps and boxes that are <br/>
unique to that gathering, reserved for people who attend the <br/>
gathering.  Sure, after the gathering, many find permanent homes in <br/>
other parts of the country, but that initial unveiling and <br/>
collecting of event stamps and boxes is in my opinion reserved for <br/>
people who are attending.<br/>
<br/>
And perhaps it all seems innocent enough when it is one person <br/>
requesting that their log book tag along, but it sets a precedent <br/>
and before you know it, a trend starts and new members, who don't <br/>
know the history and don't know that is not really how the game is <br/>
played make it common practice because they are just following <br/>
example...  and on it goes.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I am a bit befuddled.  So many times list members have <br/>
accused some here of being "elite" and not sharing experience and <br/>
information with newer members.  There are constant gripes about <br/>
the "unwritten rules" and how is one supposed to learn these if they <br/>
are not written anywhere?  But then when one of those accused of <br/>
being "elitist" responds to a post that goes against one of <br/>
the "unwritten rules" in hopes that people will actually "get it" <br/>
they are criticized for not being nice and the cry becomes, "let's <br/>
just all play our own way."<br/>
<br/>
You people need to make up your mind.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It would seem that the owners of the individual event boxes would need to be <br/>
consulted regarding the propriety of stamping into an ownerless logbook. The <br/>
following is directly from the LbNA site.  www.letterboxing.org/faq<br/>
<br/>
"Are There any Rules?<br/>
<br/>
The old cliche is that the only rule is that there are no rules. That is true for the art of <br/>
letterboxing in many senses, although there is some common sense etiquette:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Respect the land when hunting boxes and when hiding them. Don't place a box that <br/>
requires people to tramp through sensitive wildlife or plant habitat to find it, for <br/>
example. Warn hunters of possible hazards in the area of the box in your clue notes. <br/>
Use common sense. If you have any doubts, ask the land owner or manager, or simply <br/>
choose another location for your activities. Adopt the Leave No Trace principles of <br/>
outdoor etiquette. Remember, some lands have restrictions on land use; know them <br/>
and observe them.<br/>
<br/>
Don't publish or re-transmit other peoples' clues or stamp images without their <br/>
permission.<br/>
<br/>
Repack and hide the thing as well or better than it was when you found it, in the <br/>
exact place you found it. After finding it, try to be discreet when stamping up and re-<br/>
hiding it, as if you were hiding your own box for the first time. When I find one, I <br/>
usually carry it deeper into the woods to stamp up, so as to not give away its location <br/>
to any passerby's, then put it back when I am done.<br/>
<br/>
Do not post clue solutions on the Internet or discuss how to solve clues in public fora. <br/>
That spoils the fun for everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, do not violate the laws, rules, customs, and people's or property rights <br/>
wherever you conduct any activities.<br/>
<br/>
Should I Keep My Stamps Secret?<br/>
<br/>
It is Dartmoor tradition to keep your personal stamp secret, however I'm probably just <br/>
about the  only North American who follows this tradition these days, most people <br/>
like to exchange personal images when they meet.  Some people keep the box <br/>
stamps secret and but most do not. I keep them secret because it adds mystery to the <br/>
game, but it is up to you. Never scan other peoples' stamps you have found and post <br/>
them to the Internet without the hiders' permission. Of course, showing your stamp <br/>
book at a gathering in a pub is part of the fun ... :-)"<br/>

The problem with "you people" making up their/our minds is that <br/>
there is no such thing as "you people".  There is no us or them.... <br/>
just a bunch of I's.  There is no way to "all agree".  By all means, <br/>
everyone has a right to say what they think is correct or fair !and <br/>
they SHOULD), but in the end we all have to march to our own drum.<br/>
<br/>
And though I personally don't think I should have stamp images that <br/>
I didn't find, I understand why others disagree under certain <br/>
circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
As for a massive campaign for everyone's log to hitch-hike to <br/>
events... it takes two to tango and not many people will be willing <br/>
to do such favors. <br/>
<br/>
This will all balance out in the end.  <br/>

Letterboxing, traditionally, is said to 'have no rules'a <br/>
misconception at best. Letterboxing has no central governing body to <br/>
establish an official set of rules, but guidelines and conventions <br/>
have been established to help keep the peace and orderas with any <br/>
hobby with thousands of participating members. Some guidelines and <br/>
conventions have even become so sacred that they have morphed into <br/>
rules, though no method exists to enforce them. In a nutshell, <br/>
letterboxing does have rules, guidelines, and conventions, and those <br/>
that choose to break them tend to find themselves unliked, <br/>
ostracized, and alone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So it's not really suprising there would be so much angst against <br/>
logbooks without owners at events.  That's never been how things <br/>
worked before, and when you try to change the rules, it's bound to <br/>
cause problems.  *shrug*<br/>

Agree wholeheartedly.  The biggest issue is that whomever started <br/>
this topic of conversation is going to have one heck of a time <br/>
finding someone to take his/her logbook to the gathering in the <br/>
first place.  Should they find someone, is there <br/>
<br/>
a) anyone who's going to notice that someone is stamping into 2 <br/>
logbooks<br/>
<br/>
b) anyone that's going to stop them.<br/>
<br/>
While I would never send my book in my place- I personally want to <br/>
earn my stamps myself, gather them myself- that is the fun of it <br/>
after all for me.  If person x &amp; person y make a deal to do such a <br/>
thing, none of us can stop them.  BUT, I doubt many of us are going <br/>
to drag extra logbooks with us.  So, I think that all in all this <br/>
conversation is somewhat moot.<br/>

What if they are handicapped and can't do the hikes? What if they have a new baby? I can just see so many reasons that a person may have that may not want to share "WHY".  I have a nephew who is very ill in the hospital and I am going to bring him some carving materials to help him occupy his time. I have gotten a lot of my nieces and my nephews into letterboxing and carving stamps. It's great! Get's them off the Video games. But my nephew may feel bad that he can't go and personally get stamps and I feel fine about collecting them for him until he can go. Maybe that will help give him something to look forward to? Anyway, just my thoughts on this whole long thread about collecting stamps for others. Maybe we shouldn't judge why some letterboxers may do this for others or letterboxers who may ask others to do it for them!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't think anyone was being judged on the reason they couldn't <br/>
attend the gathering.  Letterbox gatherings are held in various <br/>
parts of the country throughout the year.  They are primarily for <br/>
people from that specific area of the country, although anyone can <br/>
come to the gathering and people often do travel if they want to go <br/>
bad enough or it fits into their vacation plans, and guests from <br/>
afar usually add a special flavor to a gathering.<br/>
<br/>
If you can't go to a particluar gathering, whether it is because you <br/>
live too far or because you are on your deathbed, it's not a big <br/>
deal -- you just wait for another one or find one closer to where <br/>
you live or organize one in your area.  <br/>
<br/>
Typically, in the past (if anyone other than the "ornery oldies" <br/>
really cares about how this game has been historically played), <br/>
event stamps and boxes were meant for people who actually attended <br/>
the gathering, just as box stamps are meant for people who actually <br/>
go out on the trail and hike to a box.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Agree wholeheartedly. The biggest issue is that whomever started <br/>
&gt; &gt;this topic of conversation is going to have one heck of a time <br/>
&gt; &gt;finding someone to take his/her logbook to the gathering in the <br/>
&gt; &gt;first place. Should they find someone, is there <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;a) anyone who's going to notice that someone is stamping into 2 <br/>
&gt; &gt;logbooks<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;b) anyone that's going to stop them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;While I would never send my book in my place- I personally want <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt;earn my stamps myself, gather them myself- that is the fun of it <br/>
&gt; &gt;after all for me. If person x &amp; person y make a deal to do such <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt;thing, none of us can stop them. BUT, I doubt many of us are <br/>
going <br/>
&gt; &gt;to drag extra logbooks with us. So, I think that all in all this <br/>

one to believe letterboxers are an elite, selfish, and arrogant group.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Here are my thoughts ~ and I stress these are my thoughts and no <br/>
one else has to like, dislike or even read them.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It doesn't matter in the least to me what someone does at a <br/>
gathering, with their log book, how they collect images.  For me this <br/>
isn't a competition (if it were I'd be dead last!) and what anyone <br/>
else does, does not affect me, unless they are destroying <br/>
letterboxes.   I letterbox for my own personal reasons in my own <br/>
personal way.  Every one of us does the same.  As long as I am happy <br/>
with my logbook, how you filled yours really isn't my concern.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; The bottom line is that these are ink images on paper.  They are <br/>
delightful little things to find and collect, but they are <br/>
impermanent and in the grand scheme, minuscule in importance.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I know it is a futile wish, but I still do wish that we as a group <br/>
could allow one another to enjoy this hobby in our own way, without <br/>
feeling a need to attack and insult.  While some may enjoy the sport <br/>
of that, it does hurt people's feelings and turns them away.  But <br/>
then, perhaps that is what some people would prefer.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So, once again ~ just my thoughts and opinions.  Attack away.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Right, but like I said before Snickerdoodle, that's between you &amp; <br/>
your nephew.  No one's going to stop you from collecting stamps for <br/>
him, but I doubt you'd go around collecting even more logbooks for <br/>
other people to take along- although I suppose it's within your <br/>
rights to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
As someone mentioned before, there are not hard &amp; fast rules in <br/>
letterboxing so what makes you happy, makes you happy &amp; we each <br/>
count our finds &amp; plants in our own ways.  Personally, I count it <br/>
when I get out there myself &amp; do it.  But to each their own! <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there ARE lots of reasons that a person is unable to go boxing- <br/>
for example my husband is in the military &amp; currently overseas.  We <br/>
are boxing without him.  Our family find total may be rising, but <br/>
HIS total is not.  If I can't box with the family my total won't go <br/>
up either.  I wouldn't count a box I didn't go out &amp; personally <br/>
find, but that's just my thing.  If you choose to count differently, <br/>
there is no one who's going to stop you.  <br/>

Box on &amp; have fun!<br/>
