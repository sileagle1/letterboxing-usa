You just have to get off the highways to see the good parts. There <br/>
was a good online exhibit by the NJ Historical Society about the <br/>
Turnpike, and how, although it really is a boring, ugly ride, it <br/>
sure gets you from point A to point B in a big hurry, which was all <br/>
it was designed to do.<br/>

&gt;   Hahahaha thank you for the hearty chuckle.I actually did not get <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;   injury letterboxing, which is unfortunate because then I would <br/>
be <br/>
&gt;   eligable for the purple heart LB.I was injured at a concert in <br/>
NJ <br/>
&gt;   this past weekend.I looked for LB's in the area but there werent <br/>
any <br/>
&gt;   near Newark on the site.Yet another reason I do not like NJ.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Did you sprain your ankle tripping over a letterbox in CT? If <br/>
so, <br/>
&gt;   just gimp along until you find another.  The next one can't be <br/>
too <br/>
&gt;   far away.  Just be verrrrrrry careful.  I hear that they <br/>
practically <br/>
&gt;   jump out and bite you.    ;-)<br/>
