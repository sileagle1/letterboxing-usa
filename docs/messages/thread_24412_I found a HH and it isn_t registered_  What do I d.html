I'm pretty new here, so please forgive me if this is something already <br/>
discussed.  <br/>
<br/>
I recently found a HH (and have already passed it on) and I wanted to <br/>
list it online at LBNA website, but wasn't able to since the HH wasn't <br/>
registered/its creator wasn't registered.  What do I do?<br/>
<br/>
Should I register the HH?  How do I get 'credit' online for finding <br/>
it?  (does it matter?)  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>
