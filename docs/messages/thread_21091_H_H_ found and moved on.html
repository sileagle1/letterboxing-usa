Sorta weird to have it so we decided to dump it as soon as possible and it is all ready for someone else to get it.  It is in great shape although the paper tape is running a bit short at this time.<br/>

Today was a totally great letterboxing day, two letterboxes and the HH.  Great too because it was my husbands welcome home from Korea and get introduced to letterboxing quick day.  We had a great time!<br/>
