I will be visiting friends in Holland, PA this weekend for the super <br/>
bowl (Go Pats!!)  I went to LbNA but didn't find any boxes in <br/>
Holland, what towns are close (like within 15-20 minutes) that have <br/>
some easy short easy winter boxes.  I am coming from CT and don't <br/>
know the area.  Any suggestions are greatly appreciated :D<br/>

Holland, PA appears to be near Newton, home of Tyler State Park.  <br/>
This is Lower Bucks County, the Connecticut of Pennsylvania.<br/>
<br/>
Many many boxes there.<br/>

Holland, PA   is less than 5 miles from Tyler State Park home to over 20 boxes including <br/>
the awesome Battle of the Bands series.  There are at least another 40 boxes within 30 <br/>
mins of Tyler.  How big a weekend did you have planned?  <br/>
<br/>
That area is so full of boxes it's getting like... dare I say it - Connecticut!<br/>
<br/>
Also, I wouldn't recommend coming here and walking around in secluded areas with even <br/>
the thought of "Go Pats!"  in your head.  Have you seen "Deliverance"?<br/>
