for a small profit what is to stop me from down loading all the clues from<br/>
the website and including them in my pamphelet.  I know of at least on case<br/>
where something similar has happened to an electronic source of information<br/>
(The hardcopy netted those persons quite a bit of money).  I think this is<br/>
the sort of thing we are worried about and I think that those fears are<br/>
somewhat justified especially as  letterboxing as a hobby expands.<br/>
<br/>
I think a simple statement authorizing personal use but not distributon may<br/>
be what is called for.  It is nice to believe that everbody is good and<br/>
will not abuse the situation and I personally believe that the vast<br/>
majority of people are.  But it only takes one person that believes that<br/>
"thar is gold in them thar hills" and the situtation changes.<br/>

My $0.02 USD:<br/>

I'd favor a statement that says something to the effect of "You may use any<br/>
materials on the Letterboxing USA website for personal, non-commercial use<br/>
only.  You may not sell, use in conjuntion with a commercial enterprise, or<br/>
otherwise profit from the use of these materials."  Can you tell I'm not a<br/>
lawyer?  heh heh<br/>
<br/>
I think something like that's a good compromise between too restrictive,<br/>
and protecting the material from commercial exploitation by "the bad guys".<br/>
<br/>
There you have my two cents.<br/>

<br/>
I don't agree.  Please do not force those of us who disagree with you, Dan, <br/>
to pull our clues from the site.  So far, by my count of the posts on this <br/>
issue, no one agrees with you.  Will the majority rule on this issue, as it <br/>
has on others?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps each individual who agrees with Dan's statement (see above) should <br/>
paste it into their clues.  Those of us who do not agree with the above <br/>
statement and who care about retaining control over the use and distribution <br/>
of our clues can add a statement to that effect (such as the one Thom Cheney <br/>
suggested).<br/>
<br/>
Can we come to an agreement on how to proceed? It seems clear, from today's <br/>
posts anyway, what people want.<br/>

Well you asked to here from others.  Here goes nothing I have been reading up <br/>
on this list trying to figure all the ins and outs of letterboxing and let me <br/>
tell you every time I think I am about ready to get my feet wet some new <br/>
wrinkle or "problem " crops up.  Please just let me say as a real new person <br/>
to this idea was drawn to it as good clean outdoor family fun, but it is fast <br/>
starting to scare me off.  For what it is worth you all might want to think <br/>
how these discussions betwwen yourselves might have a way of unnerving new <br/>
people from joining in on the fun for fear of doing something wrong or being <br/>
in fear of copying something they were not supposed too.<br/>
Sorry so long winded but did not know how else to say it <br/>
Thanks for your time <br/>

&gt;  Basically, to keep the honest people honest Dan'l.  Probably 90% of<br/>
&gt;  copyright infringement is by people who don't realize they are<br/>
&gt;  breaking the law.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sure you want to impose the law on this?  I've been very <br/>
understanding/respectful of the law (and I believe we always should<br/>
be), but esp. in cases where we may find ourselves in trouble if<br/>
we do otherwise - I mean particularly in cases where we need protection<br/>
from lawsuits.  But in this situation the only thing being<br/>
accomplished is (in theory) better control of your clues and images.<br/>
It is an optional use of the law toward some end that may not even<br/>
be realized and which may in turn close the door to some people <br/>
who are looking for a real open group.  And kids may not understand<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend for those who want to do this, that they use the special<br/>
notes section of the form to add a statement or to specifically ask<br/>
for it to be added.  Otherwise you are forcing everyone to state that<br/>
they wish to enforce a copyright when perhaps they do not want to.<br/>
I'm perfectly OK with others copying, using and/or distributing my<br/>
material.  Its for fun.  Susan Davis made my personal stamp.  Who<br/>
owns that copyright?  I have always assumed that Susan does not<br/>
mind me using it without attribution.  As a rule I do do that, but<br/>
its also OK if I don't.  I would think it would be likewise with all<br/>
of our material.  I'll be greatly disappointed if everyone wants to<br/>
enforce copyrighting of materials as I think it detracts from<br/>
what we are trying to do.  I know this is subjective opinion.<br/>
OK.  Its just what I'm saying.<br/>
<br/>
Do we really want to make a formal declaration like this?<br/>
Does this not make our material exclusive then (at least in<br/>
theory)?  What's wrong with just pulling them from the site<br/>
if you don't want them copied?  What's wrong with stating in <br/>
a note that they should just limit themselves to one printout<br/>
for personal use?  But then what happens if they make a copy<br/>
for a friend?  Are they breaking the law?  And what if they<br/>
do not make a copy for their friend?  Did we lose a person<br/>
who would otherwise have become involved?<br/>
<br/>
My gut feeling is that we should not do this.  I think we<br/>
should state unequivocally that the materials may be shared<br/>
and freely distributed without atrribution if so desired.<br/>
This was the sentiment a few months back when we broke away<br/>
on our own.  Our premise was to keep it open and above all<br/>
free (yet be responsible).  If we make a formal declaration<br/>
on our page that discourages people from sharing I don't<br/>
think its a good thing.  I will support it if its what people<br/>
want, but I don't think its a good thing, esp. for kids who<br/>
may infer that we are providing something other than fun and<br/>
creativity.<br/>
<br/>
Its good to hear some of your opinions.  It would be nice<br/>
to hear from some of the people who do not often make comments.<br/>
You out there?  Anyone at all out there who does not care if<br/>
their material is copyrighted?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another take on this subject - some simple, blanket statement about free<br/>
not-for-profit distribution is called for. <br/>
As Thom accurately says, these are already copyrighted by virtue of<br/>
their very existance, so in reality we could choose to do nothing.<br/>
However, by making a statement of some sort, we also tell the world that<br/>
we respect our work enough to identify it as "intellectual property", or<br/>
as "art."  And, keeping the honest person honest is always a good goal. <br/>
<br/>
In reality, enforcement would probably never be necessary.  But, what if<br/>
these stamps become very collectible? What if someone collects (or<br/>
downloads) a stamp image, decides that it is marketable, has it<br/>
reproduced in quantity and it winds up on the shelf of K-MART? Who does<br/>
that benefit, except for the merchant, at the artist's expense.<br/>
<br/>
How would we feel if someone published a letterboxing USA guide, copied<br/>
Mitch's masthead from the page, maybe changed one photo, claimed<br/>
artistic ownership, and made some real cash for the effort? Mitch would<br/>
be upset, I am sure, as would I. <br/>
<br/>
I think we can craft a very benign reminder, and let that be the end of<br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
I do, however, understand Dan's fears about straying from our 'free and<br/>
open" attitude, I jusst think that this is not in conflict. <br/>

&gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  Well you asked to hear from others.  Here goes...<br/>
&gt;  For what it is worth you all might want to think<br/>
&gt;  how these discussions between yourselves might have<br/>
&gt;  a way of unnerving new people from joining in on<br/>

<br/>
No, I for one do not want to unnerve new people.  I like<br/>
hearing from new people.  Thank you very much for speaking<br/>
up.  I hope more people will do that.  I don't want to<br/>
alienate you or anyone else who tends to be more quiet.<br/>
I understand why you tend not to say much on this list and<br/>
I just want to say that I hope the environment will change<br/>
so you will feel more free, more welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody said Sherri that its not likely that anyone will<br/>
prosecute or enforce the copyright of their material.  I<br/>
believe this to be true.  At the same time I am bothered<br/>
that we have to take up the concern so dramatically as to<br/>
potentially scare people off.  I especially wonder what<br/>
it says to kids about what we're doing, what we're about.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to risk going further into a corner than I already<br/>
am on this if I might (is that even possible?).  Well, here<br/>
goes:  What about not being too artistic?  This is not meant<br/>
as a slam to artists so please, please don't take it that way.<br/>
I love art and I respect people who put their life into art.<br/>
I recently received a slide from one of the artists in our<br/>
group and I spent fully an hour looking at it (in silence)<br/>
and I was awestruck by the attention to detail and the <br/>
quality of the piece.  I will never forget it.  But I'm<br/>
just wondering if the web, letterboxing, and what we are<br/>
doing in particular with letterboxing USA is something else.<br/>
I'm not saying it has no artisitic value, quite the contrary.<br/>
I'm just wondering if the value lies more in what we are<br/>
doing by cooperating and becoming friends (if even in a <br/>
limited way) and included in that would be the value of what<br/>
we've created (as a whole) - this is perhaps much greater<br/>
and is perhaps a more real value in the long-term than any one<br/>
element, whether it is a stamp image, a clue or a web program. <br/>
<br/>
I'd like the new people and young people in particular to<br/>
see our rapport and our aplomb: our down-to-earth common<br/>
good nature and willingness to work together.  Many of<br/>
them are holding back and just waiting for the moment for<br/>
all of us to lighten up a bit.  I'm weary whenever we start<br/>
to talk about legal issues.  I know we must do this at times<br/>
and I've done it as much as anyone.  I especially don't mind<br/>
it if it protects us and helps us to preserve the fun.  But<br/>
don't we go a little beyond what's necessary to do that<br/>
at times?<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone a lawyer?  I'd like to know if its possible to <br/>
do this stuff so kids (or anyone with a little education) can<br/>
make sense of it.  I mean what are we trying to say? -<br/>
"You can copy anything here that you want as long as you use<br/>
it for letterboxing and do not make money from it."  Is that<br/>
what we mean to say?  If so, what's wrong with just adding<br/>
that to the waiver we already have?  Since virtually every<br/>
clue is linked to it this would cover all concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any objection to this, and, if not, can I just <br/>
make that change so we can get back to what we were doing before?<br/>
I'm interested in hearing what some of the new people have to<br/>
say if they are still willing to put in their piece.<br/>
<br/>
I know we're going to have more problems in the future.  We would<br/>
have to be dead if we didn't.  I'm just hoping that in general<br/>
we will begin to have a better understanding of what we need to<br/>
do for newbies, kids and others who may be more hesitant than the<br/>
rest of us.<br/>

&gt;safety statement that the Graphic Artist Guild recommends is:  "All<br/>
&gt;other rights, unless specifically granted are retained by the<br/>

<br/>
Even though I haven't actually found a darn letterbox yet (Sunday I will and<br/>
I don't care how hard it's raining...besides-- waterfalls, mud and rain are<br/>
my Oregon heritage!!) I can see why all theses viewpoints are valid in their<br/>
own way.  If I had some clues and stamps on the web, I'd not want them to be<br/>
changed or utilized in some forum other than simply looking for the<br/>
letterbox unbeknownst to me.  If someone took my info from the web, put it<br/>
in a booklet that was for SALE only, I would think that uncouth, and I could<br/>
do something, legally, to stop such person from selling what is intended to<br/>
be given freely. It could require a lot of hoop jumping and legal headaches,<br/>
though. If there were some sort of statement that is included with the clues<br/>
(there were several excellent ideas mentioned earlier) then there would be a<br/>
sort of legal (maybe :) ) precedent set that states that the material used<br/>
is owned by it's creator and that <hey, all="" and="" have<br="" info="" this="" use="" want="" you="">
fun with it, but don't sell it or do stuff to alter it that I don't know<br/>
about&gt;. IE; Be considerate and ask first. I'm rambling... I don't think that<br/>
any such statement will disuade a newcomer, and I do agree that it's sad<br/>
that our society is so litigious that anyone would have to even think of<br/>
these things.  I was surprised even to see the disclaimer about injuries<br/>
when I first saw the website. I laughed, in a jaded sort of way, but<br/>
realized that someone, somewhere might blame a letterboxer if he or she got<br/>
hurt while seeking for the box. <br/>
	Also, I really like the "what's new" idea for the web site.<br/>

&gt;  &gt;  &gt; Thom Cheney<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  &gt;<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  Well you asked to hear from others.  Here goes...<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  For what it is worth you all might want to think<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  how these discussions between yourselves might have<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  a way of unnerving new people from joining in on<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  the fun...<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  No, I for one do not want to unnerve new people.  I like<br/>
&gt;  hearing from new people.  Thank you very much for speaking<br/>
&gt;  up.  I hope more people will do that.  I don't want to<br/>
&gt;  alienate you or anyone else who tends to be more quiet.<br/>
&gt;  I understand why you tend not to say much on this list and<br/>
&gt;  I just want to say that I hope the environment will change<br/>
&gt;  so you will feel more free, more welcome.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Somebody said Sherri that its not likely that anyone will<br/>
&gt;  prosecute or enforce the copyright of their material.  I<br/>
&gt;  believe this to be true.  At the same time I am bothered<br/>
&gt;  that we have to take up the concern so dramatically as to<br/>
&gt;  potentially scare people off.  I especially wonder what<br/>
&gt;  it says to kids about what we're doing, what we're about.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I'd like to risk going further into a corner than I already<br/>
&gt;  am on this if I might (is that even possible?).  Well, here<br/>
&gt;  goes:  What about not being too artistic?  This is not meant<br/>
&gt;  as a slam to artists so please, please don't take it that way.<br/>
&gt;  I love art and I respect people who put their life into art.<br/>
&gt;  I recently received a slide from one of the artists in our<br/>
&gt;  group and I spent fully an hour looking at it (in silence)<br/>
&gt;  and I was awestruck by the attention to detail and the <br/>
&gt;  quality of the piece.  I will never forget it.  But I'm<br/>
&gt;  just wondering if the web, letterboxing, and what we are<br/>
&gt;  doing in particular with letterboxing USA is something else.<br/>
&gt;  I'm not saying it has no artisitic value, quite the contrary.<br/>
&gt;  I'm just wondering if the value lies more in what we are<br/>
&gt;  doing by cooperating and becoming friends (if even in a <br/>
&gt;  limited way) and included in that would be the value of what<br/>
&gt;  we've created (as a whole) - this is perhaps much greater<br/>
&gt;  and is perhaps a more real value in the long-term than any one<br/>
&gt;  element, whether it is a stamp image, a clue or a web program. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I'd like the new people and young people in particular to<br/>
&gt;  see our rapport and our aplomb: our down-to-earth common<br/>
&gt;  good nature and willingness to work together.  Many of<br/>
&gt;  them are holding back and just waiting for the moment for<br/>
&gt;  all of us to lighten up a bit.  I'm weary whenever we start<br/>
&gt;  to talk about legal issues.  I know we must do this at times<br/>
&gt;  and I've done it as much as anyone.  I especially don't mind<br/>
&gt;  it if it protects us and helps us to preserve the fun.  But<br/>
&gt;  don't we go a little beyond what's necessary to do that<br/>
&gt;  at times?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Is anyone a lawyer?  I'd like to know if its possible to <br/>
&gt;  do this stuff so kids (or anyone with a little education) can<br/>
&gt;  make sense of it.  I mean what are we trying to say? -<br/>
&gt;  "You can copy anything here that you want as long as you use<br/>
&gt;  it for letterboxing and do not make money from it."  Is that<br/>
&gt;  what we mean to say?  If so, what's wrong with just adding<br/>
&gt;  that to the waiver we already have?  Since virtually every<br/>
&gt;  clue is linked to it this would cover all concerned.<br/>

I'm here to talk about letterboxing.  Let everybody tell us what they want<br/>
to do with their images, clues, etc. and let it go.  We don't have to agree<br/>
or match up in any way.  Our clues vary as much as our personalities.  I<br/>
don't think any of us know enough to start making rules for each other.  I<br/>
don't think any of us is more responsible than another for the little<br/>
letterboxing dance we're trying to do...<br/>

I don't think going round and round about this stuff resolves anything.<br/>
