<br/>
I'm not really sure what resources the letterboxing.org website went<br/>
over, but based on my experience with Atlas Quest, there's a lot more<br/>
at issue than just bandwidth. For me, running the queries that perform<br/>
the searches or look up message board posts and such take up far more<br/>
of their share of processing power, and I've been considering<br/>
upgrading my account. For the bandwidth itself, AQ uses less than 10%<br/>
of what's allotted to it.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming LbNA is suffering from similar problems, it's not likely the<br/>
site is suffering from bandwidth issues but rather processing power to<br/>
run the queries.<br/>

The Letterboxing North America site will be offline until we can move to a new hosting service. Unfortunately, the low cost web hosting that we've been using can't accept the increasing load that we're putting on the shared server as letterboxing has grown over the years. More details on where we'll go next soon.<br/>

Great idea - I'd be happy to throw a couple of bucks LBNAs way for <br/>
every couple of boxes I look up there.  Paypal is so easy to use, <br/>

  &gt; I have a suggestion to save bandwidth, remove the scroll graphic<br/>
  &gt; and any other non-essential graphics from the webpages.<br/>
<br/>
  I'm not really sure what resources the letterboxing.org website went<br/>
  over, but based on my experience with Atlas Quest, there's a lot more<br/>
  at issue than just bandwidth. For me, running the queries that perform<br/>
  the searches or look up message board posts and such take up far more<br/>
  of their share of processing power, and I've been considering<br/>
  upgrading my account. For the bandwidth itself, AQ uses less than 10%<br/>
  of what's allotted to it.<br/>
<br/>
  Assuming LbNA is suffering from similar problems, it's not likely the<br/>
  site is suffering from bandwidth issues but rather processing power to<br/>
  run the queries.<br/>

a victim of credit card theft from an online purchase I made when I gave the<br/>
company I ordered from my credit card number and expiration date.  That was<br/>
no fun.  Ended up with somebody in the UK subscribing to a bunch of<br/>
Singapore sex sites.  But I've never had any problem with paypal, so paypal<br/>
is definitely preferred by me.<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, my paypal account isn't "verified."  In other words,<br/>
I use only a credit card with them.  So if there *were* to be a problem, I<br/>
can challenge it thru my credit card company and don't have to rely on<br/>
paypal getting involved.  Personally, I would never ever give paypal my bank<br/>
account numbers like they want for a "verified" account.<br/>

Please expand on known problems with PayPal. I've used it twice <br/>
(recent subscriber on Ebay) without issues but as in all things: <br/>
Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware). And so I ask, what am I <br/>

I have usesd PayPal with no problems for a long time.  I also have<br/>
received suspicious emails about a new name being added to my<br/>
account.  Checking with PayPal, these were indeed phishing attempts. <br/>
I never open these but immediately delete them.  Read PayPal's<br/>
security policy.  They say they will always address you by name if<br/>
the email is from them.  The phishing attempts do not use your name. <br/>
I have found this very helpful and continue to feel good about<br/>
PayPal.  So easy, so convenient.<br/>
