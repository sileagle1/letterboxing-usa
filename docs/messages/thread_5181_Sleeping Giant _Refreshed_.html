Margaret and I tromped around those foggy heights today <br/>
and "refreshed" Right Knee, Right Hip, and Hezekial's Knob. We also <br/>
replaced the missing Tower letterbox with a new one. All have new <br/>
handcut stamps as well. We spruced up "Chest," but didn't make it <br/>
over to "Chin," and hope to check on that one during the Gathering. <br/>
If you're heading our way, please print out the new-and-improved <br/>
cluesheet from:<br/>

Looking forward to a great weekend, and hope to see you there. Enjoy!<br/>
