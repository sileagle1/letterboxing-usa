HI there all yall,..<br/>
I'm a little excited,..<br/>
complete beginer,.. I just started today after finding the <br/>
letterboxing.org website through WWDN last night and falling in love <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm Proud to say that as of this moment, less than 24 hours later <br/>
I have my first two stamps in my book.<br/>
<br/>
I hit playball first, but it was no go, Either I was way off or it was <br/>
gone,<br/>
But this afternoon I ran out and did Turtle Crossing and had the <br/>
wonderful fortune to get a hitchhiker with it.<br/>
<br/>
I am completely enamored and thankful to all yall for the romps your <br/>
going to giveme.<br/>
<br/>
You're all awfully nifty,<br/>
Pleased to meet you, Ladies and gents,<br/>
Knotty Klown!<br/>

Hi Knotty Klown,<br/>
Here are a few links you might find helpful. Silent Doug has a <br/>
wealth of information as does Atlas Quest. At AQ you can find a <br/>
good "Code of Conduct" and if you have any questions the newboxer <br/>
chat list is set up for the new letterboxer. You will find some <br/>
other links on the left hand side of this page as well.<br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug's site:<br/>

<br/>
AtlasQuest:<br/>

<br/>
newboxers' group:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
There is a Pacific Northwest chat list also.<br/>
