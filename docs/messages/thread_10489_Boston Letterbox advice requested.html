I have never been to Boston and don't know much about it. I'm staying <br/>
at the Westin Copley Place (10 Huntington Ave.).<br/>

I would greatly appreciate any advice on which letterboxes in the <br/>
area are "doable" given I won't have a vehicle, won't have any <br/>
serious gear, and the weather will be cold.<br/>

Just read your message and may be too late! There aren't any boxes <br/>
right in Boston. You could take a bus from Harvard Sq. to Watertown <br/>
Sq. and find the Heron on the Charles in Watertown. There is a bus <br/>
that leaves Copley (in front of the library) that also goes to <br/>
Watertown Square. I'm sorry to say I have blanked on the Bus numbers <br/>
and will have to reply again. You could also take a bus to Belmont <br/>
Center and walk to the Habitat for the letterbox there or a bus to <br/>
Waverly Sq. in Belmont and walk to Beaverbrook to find the box there. <br/>
If it's cold it could be a not-so-fun walk. I'm not sure if there are <br/>
busses to Blue Hills in Milton. There are several boxes there.<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to get back to you soon on the bus #'s, but can't promise <br/>
(very busy day!).<br/>

We found 1 box during our trip to Boston - The Mad Chef. It was a 1 <br/>
1/2 hour round trip, taking the T from Bay Bay to Forest Hills.<br/>
Hopefully we'll get back some day to check out to other boxes in this <br/>
great city.<br/>
