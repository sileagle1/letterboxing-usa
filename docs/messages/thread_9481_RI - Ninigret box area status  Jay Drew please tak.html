                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a pretty poor showing of letterboxing this weekend.  I was 0 <br/>
for 3 finds yesterday (looking for mysteries, though) and 1 for 4 <br/>
today.  Good thing I usually do better than this.  I am going to <br/>
chalk it up to the cold weather.  That wind just goes right through <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Jay, I went to Ninigret today to find your recently replaced first <br/>
box.  The Feds are clear cutting the entire area.  From the <br/>
observation tower and info board south to the water has been totally <br/>
cleared of brush, rocks, shrubs, (and I think, letterboxes.)  There <br/>
is absolutely nothing left but dirt.  I poked around in the dirt with <br/>
a stick looking for possible remains of a tubberware container but <br/>
saw nothing.  Although I cannot say the box is missing, I could not <br/>
find it.  The whole area is demolished.<br/>
<br/>
I took 2 letterboxes out with me to plant in Ningret but took them <br/>
home due to all the digging/construction out there.  I also plan to <br/>
post detour directions to anyone who wants to do the Take It Easy box <br/>
since that side of the Wildlife Refuge does not appear affected.  I <br/>
don't recommend taking the directions to Take It Easy as posted since <br/>
the area is such a mess. (Passable but not very pretty.)<br/>
