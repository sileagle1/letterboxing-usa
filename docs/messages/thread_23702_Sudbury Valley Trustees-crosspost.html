<br/>
I just wanted to let people know that I am currently taking  <br/>
responsibility (as a volunteer) for the Sudbury Valley Trustees  <br/>
(headquartered in Sudbury MA)<br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I have created a blog as a central repository for clues boxes placed  <br/>
on SVT land. Then the clues can be placed on LBNA or Atlasquest, but  <br/>
be available as a single entity on the blog   <br/>
http://svtletterboxing.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
I would like to do this with boxes not owned by SVT as well.<br/>
<br/>
There are still many properties that don't have letterboxes on them.<br/>
I think they would like to keep them limited to the "20 frequent walks  <br/>
locations"<br/>
<br/>
http://www.sudburyvalleytrustees.org/page.php?id=96.<br/>
<br/>
There are trail maps to link to.<br/>
<br/>
At this point the only requirements are that we be notified about the  <br/>
placement, that not too much of the habitat is disturbed in placing  <br/>
boxes, and it would be nice if a reference to SVT be in the clue, or  <br/>
on the stamp and logbook.<br/>
<br/>
i am also in the process of replacing the store-bought stamps with  <br/>
carved ones, each of which will have SVT on them.<br/>
<br/>
So anyone with an SVT land box, can you contact me?<br/>
