<br/>
well, my DH and I went boxing yesterday and found or first (and second) box.<br/>
<br/>
we had a great time, and never knew that park was there before. we didn't<br/>
find the 1st of the 3 boxes (we even went back and rechecked after seeing<br/>
the small size of the other 2).<br/>
<br/>
also, the log books of both #2 and #3 boxes are completely full. someone had<br/>
added a piece of paper to the #2 box to continue the log. we added a piece<br/>
to the #3 to continue it. also, no stamp pads in either box. I don't know if<br/>
they had them originally (small size and all) but wanted to let whoever know<br/>
just in case.<br/>
<br/>
thank you for a great afternoon.<br/>

these boxes were planted awhile back and the owner may no longer be <br/>
checking on them(orphan boxes). But you may want to read the clues <br/>
for box #1 again. That spectacular view stamped a wonderful image <br/>
into my gray matter. <br/>

<div>My son and I just returned from vacationing 
there.  We tried to find "Leafy" in Golden Gate park and the series of 
three boxes in Bol Park in Palo Alto.  We had no luck whatsoever.  All 
the boxes had been placed in highly trafficked areas appeared to be 
missing.  I wished we had tried the Bay Area Refuge 
series.</div>
