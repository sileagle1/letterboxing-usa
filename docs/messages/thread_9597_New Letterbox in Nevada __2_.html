Red Rock Canyon<br/>
Las Vegas<br/>
Clark County<br/>
Planted 12/8/02<br/>
By Amanda from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
There is a $5 fee to enter the Red Rock Canyon Scenic Loop.<br/>
Stop at the White Rock Springs Trailhead.(mile marker 6 on the scenic <br/>
loop) There is a lower parking area and then 1/2 mile down a very <br/>
bumpy gravel road is the upper parking area. From the SW corner of <br/>
the upper parking area take this trail. At the fork, go right. <br/>
Continue to the concrete pond. Locals will sometimes stock <br/>
this "pond" with goldfish. There were not any there the day I <br/>
visited, but you can collect a goldfish for your letterboxing <br/>
notebook!<br/>
<br/>
Retrace your steps up the trail and at the point where the trail <br/>
curves, look to your left for a Large White Rock that looks like it <br/>
has acne! In the crack at the front of this rock is the Goldfish <br/>
Letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet and read the waiver of liability and <br/>
responsibility!<br/>
Thank You<br/>
