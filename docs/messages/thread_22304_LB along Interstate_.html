LB's listed as being at rest stops.  I have found several (thank you!)<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if there might be more right along the Interstates <br/>
which are not so marked?   <br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion, if any of you have hidden LB's near the <br/>
Interstates, it would be of great help if an exit number is included <br/>
in the name of the box.  Most of us on long trips do not have the <br/>
luxury of taking a side trip consisting of several miles off the route <br/>
of travel for a search.<br/>
<br/>
Happy LB'ing!<br/>

If you haven't found it yet, the Trip Planner on Atlas Quest might be<br/>
useful. It allows you to search for letterboxes along specific routes<br/>
including I-95. It won't tell you which ones are specifically at rest<br/>
areas, but you'll have a good listing of boxes within a few miles of<br/>
the interstate.<br/>
