&gt;Hey guys, I am sooooo sorry! I accidentally misposted the update that I <br/>
&gt;wouldn't be able to find Ray's with you guys when I planned Due to an <br/>
&gt;employee's shift that I had to cover on the saturday morning. Peter Miner <br/>
&gt;knew about it though. He's the one I sent the note to and forgot to CC the <br/>
&gt;egroups list. Sorry once again guys! By the way, did you guys go anyway? <br/>
&gt;If you did, did you bag it? Let me know! I hope I haven't lost my help <br/>
