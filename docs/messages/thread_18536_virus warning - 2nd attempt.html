During the next several weeks be VERY cautious about opening or<br/>
      &gt;             launching any e-mails that refer to the World Trade Center or 9/11 in<br/>
      &gt;             any way, regardless of who sent it. PLEASE FORWARD TO ALL YOUR<br/>
      &gt;             FRIENDS AND FAMILY. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW, "WTC" STANDS FOR THE<br/>
      &gt;             WORLD TRADE CENTER. REALLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL OPEN IT<br/>
      &gt;             RIGHT AWAY, THINKING ITS A STORY RELATING TO 9/11!<br/>
      &gt;<br/>
      &gt;             BIGGGG TROUBLE !!!! DO NOT OPEN "WTC Survivor" It is a virus that<br/>
      &gt;             will erase your whole "C" drive.. It will come to you in the form of<br/>
      &gt;             an E-Mail from a familiar person. I repeat, a friend sent it to me,<br/>
      &gt;             but called and warned me before I opened it. He was not so lucky and<br/>
      &gt;             now he can't even start his computer!<br/>
      &gt;<br/>
      &gt;             Forward this to everyone in your address book. I would rather<br/>
      &gt;             receive this 25 times than not at all. So, if you receive an email<br/>
      &gt;             called "WTC Survivor", do not open it. Delete it right away! This<br/>
      &gt;             virus removes all dynamic link libraries (.dll files) from your<br/>
      &gt;             computer <br/>
