&gt; Hi QB<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think you answered the "restriction" point of view very nicely. If<br/>
&gt; you want to restrict the access do it with some class and<br/>
&gt; creativity. Just make the clues a little more obscure or create a<br/>
&gt; mystery letterbox. It is just too easy to place an F1, F100 or F1000<br/>
&gt; and where is the ingenuity in that.<br/>

1.  the F1 restriction is no longer automatically in place on AQ to<br/>
prevent search engines.  You can click the "prevent search engine"<br/>
check box, but it no longer puts an automatic F1 restriction on the<br/>
letterbox.  You do have the option to manually put a F1, F10, F25,<br/>

3.  If you get to know the boxers in your area, chances are higher<br/>
that more clues may come your way.  <br/>

4.  I wish there would be P25, P50, P100 restrictions available on AQ,<br/>

Yes, we are new letterboxers, but have a lot of experience with <br/>
geocaching which has similar aspects (respect the vegetation, <br/>
placement, etc.. etc...).  Geocaching does have the cache saturation <br/>

too close to another cache (like a puzzle cache where the coordinates <br/>

As you said there are restricted types of letterboxes: WOM, f-count, bonus boxes. By their nature, you wouldn't  know where they are if you don't have the clues. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, that exact thing happened to me a few months ago.  At our annual<br/>
gathering, which was in my area, I had planted a box but had not posted it<br/>
right away - laziness and unwinding from the gathering.  A new boxer came<br/>
along and planted a box within feet - literally - of the one I planted.  So<br/>
yes, it can and does happen.  Because I was slow in listing my clues<br/>
AND because I didn't want to get stinky and wind up discouraging a newbie, I<br/>
rehid the box (actually went to rehide it, but it was gone, although it was<br/>
later rediscovered by the planter of the other box, who I had warned about<br/>
the situation so they would know what the deal was if the box did<br/>
resurface).  It would get a little stickier if it were a bona fide WOM and I<br/>
had distributed clues!<br/>
