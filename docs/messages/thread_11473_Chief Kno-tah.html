I know at least one person has figured out generally where it is. <br/>

Yep. I debated quite a while on whether or not to have the <br/>
explanation. Leaving the explanation out would have certainly been <br/>
scantier. <br/>

Indeed. I've even found a box without using any clues (they exisited <br/>
but were at the time unpublished). So I've at least accomplished the <br/>
ultimate in the other direction. Although I guess in that I wasn't <br/>
actually looking for that particular box - or any box - and rather a <br/>
hiding spot, it doesn't really count. <br/>

I went to Kennedy Creek to plant boxes for the recent Weblos outing.  As I<br/>
was wandering around looking for good hiding places, I came across a good<br/>
spot that would have a good orienteering clue.  When I looked, it appeared<br/>
someone else had found it already, so I decided to log in.  I reached in and<br/>
found a videocassette case.  When I opened it, there wasn't a letterbox, but<br/>
just a note: "This spot reserved for Evil Glenn"!  I logged in on the back<br/>
of the reservation!<br/>
