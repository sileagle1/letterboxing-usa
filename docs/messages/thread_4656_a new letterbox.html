                    <html><body>North of New Haven, in the town of Branford, off of I-95 snuggled in an old building that has watched the century pass by on North Main Street is a real treasure, The Shoreline Stamp Shoppe.  <br/>
<br/>
Hidden within its walls are hundreds of treasures but only one will be the one that you seek   <br/>
For directions to this magical place go to the website and take a peek   www.<a href="http://shorelinestampshoppe.com/">shorelinestampshoppe.com</a> <br/>
<br/>
Come into the Shoppe and keep your eyes wide<br/>
Look up and look down, be sure to check every side<br/>
<br/>
When you find the letter-boxing sign<br/>
Turn halfway around and walk a straight line<br/>
<br/>
12 paces will bring you near to your quest<br/>
6 paces to the right will do the rest<br/>
<br/>
When you find the stacks look down toward your socks<br/>
And nearby you will find the hidden letter box<br/>
<br/>
If you are among the first to find it, there is a treasure for you inside it.<br/>
