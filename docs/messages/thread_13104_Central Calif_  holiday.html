5/21 -  Amanda and Ryan's Black Hills box-  Found Ryan's but pretty sure Amanda's is gone.  Found the big  rock  &amp; and smaller one with the spot it should have been.  Too bad for us.<br/>
Mr. Chong's Box  Our first JugglerMouse box and a nicely carved stamp too!<br/>
Onion Tree, this was a bit of a logistical challenge.  The gardener was about, the sprinklers were on and several folks were in the garden hanging around. Thanks to JugglerMouse and Sir Balthazar<br/>
Native American Bear  This is a box we didn't expect to find as we were newbies in SLO, but we found ourselves eating lunch right near the site.  We let the dogs cool off and stamped in!<br/>
Walking Tour of SLO by Ryan--All you folks who have done these boxes know what a kick the series is.  Ryan has produced hours of fun for us.  Put yourself in this picture:  Don sitting on a little lunch cooler with 2 dogs at his feet, Gwen reading off lists of numbers and tourists giving us the most interesting looks.  After several hours the only people who asked us what we were doing were folks from England and New Zealand.  The locals left us alone.  Perhaps they had witnessed the phenomenon before.    We received a surprise bonus at the final check in.<br/>
Leon's Bookstore, a tiny little box by Ryan was next and then we finished our<br/>
day with Run for the Border (the short course).  <br/>
5/22  With the fog heavily covering the coast we checked out Ron Goldman's artistic stamp and site at Montana De Oro then our little Coyote Box (Thanks to Ryan for his comments) and finally stamped into the Mc Jones BMW box.  On this cold and gloomy day we thought we would have the area to ourselves but 3 ladies spied us at our work and thought we were up to no good  so we had to fill them into the game (without showing them the site) least they turn us into the P.D. as they said they were contemplating doing had we not spoken to them..  <br/>
Night and Day box by Amanda.  Our Brittanys liked this walk and we liked the stamp. <br/>
Night Train by Amanda, It was shortly after 3 P.M. &amp; we saw the train pull in!<br/>
JugglerMouse's Alaskan Series 1 &amp; 2  Nice way to end the day!<br/>
5/23 We has an ambitious day planned with Ryan's Camelot series slated for A.M. and one  of several SLO boxes for the afternoon but Ryan kept us imprisoned in Tick Forest for 4 hours and we felt lucky to get all the boxes (out of order even). We were picking ticks off us days later, Yuck!  But what fun and memories.  Our thanks to Central Coast box placers.  <br/>
