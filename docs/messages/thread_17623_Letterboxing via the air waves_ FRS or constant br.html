Lots of folks aren't familiar with radio communications. I'm just<br/>
learning it myself. A relatively cheap unit can be found at Radio<br/>
Shack under the part # 21-1905. That unit has a 7-mile range. Go to<br/>
the radio shack website and put that number in the search box. <br/>
<br/>
The problem with FRS units is the limited range. While places like<br/>
Conn. have tons of boxers out almost every weather-friendly weekend,<br/>
most areas of the country are very spread out. A 7-mile range will not<br/>
do me any good here in GA. <br/>
<br/>
I'm considering how to broadcast a repeated clue message continually<br/>
over the airwaves that could be picked up by anyone who comes within<br/>
range of my transmitter and who knows the proper broadcast channel.<br/>
<br/>
But for folks that letterbox in groups, or who visit high<br/>
boxer-traffic areas, a FRS unit would be a great unit to use for<br/>
communication.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
Mark<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally I would avoid anything that has Radio Shacks name alone<br/>
printed on it. If you could find "Motorola" or "Icom" etc. printed<br/>
some where that would be different. That opinion stems from several<br/>
bad experiences I had with their equiptment when I first got my<br/>
amateur radio license. It's totally my opinion. I'm sure there are<br/>
others that will disagree.<br/>
<br/>
The claim of 7+ plus miles is, to my understanding, using what is<br/>
called the GMRS frequencies. You have to hold a license from the FCC<br/>
to operate on these frequencies. FRS, or family radio service, is a<br/>
freebie and there are TONS of great radios out there for that purpose.<br/>
I have some law enforcement friends/family that even have commercial<br/>
grade radios programed for the FRS channels and they monitor them as<br/>
well as CB channel 9. CB scares me - I cannot listen to it for more<br/>
than a few minutes before the filth and foul language get to me. Maybe<br/>
its the area I live in, maybe I'm overly sensitive. I currently hold a<br/>
General class amateur license and have no need for the CB anymore as I<br/>
can talk hundreds of miles just using a handheld radio. I never<br/>
hike/camp/ etc. with out a radio and/or cell phone.<br/>
<br/>
The whole idea of a transmitter that just loops a message is really<br/>
cool. I know there are some Realtors that use this idea, they call it<br/>
"talking house". It just plays the same message over and over and over<br/>
and over....<br/>
<br/>
My apologies for the rantings. I lost alot (several hundred) dollars<br/>
to Radio Shack poor customer service. It's sort of a hot button for me.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting.<br/>
