<div>David and I went to Bear's Den in New Salem, MA today to check 
on the letterboxes placed there.  Just wanted to make sure that the 
nude dude who menaced Bonnie hadn't gone back and done anything to Bob &amp; 
Ginger's beautiful letterbox. It was intact with Bonnie's stamp the last one in 
the logbook. While we were there we checked on Bear's Den #2, which we planted, 
to see if anyone had found it yet. Congrats to Sue from Pelham, the first and 
only finder so far. </div>

<br/>
<br/>&lt;&lt;David and I went to Bear's Den in New Salem, MA today to check on the letterboxes placed there.  Just wanted to make sure that the nude dude who menaced Bonnie hadn't gone back and done anything to Bob &amp; Ginger's beautiful letterbox.

<br/>Not any more. We stamped Bear's Den #1 and #2 this afternoon. Our four year old found the second box (his first!), so now all four of us have found at least one box. We also saw no evidence of naked people, much to our disappointment. :-)   This small park is quite nice, yet another place we wouldn't have gone if we hadn't heard of this hobby. The park also seems to be quite popular, as we were not the only visitors there, and at least two groups of people came and went while we were there. Thankfully, the boxes are a bit farther back than I suspect most people would go, so they should be quite safe.
<br/>
<br/>Hey Buckaroo! We actually beat you to a box! :::happy dance:::
<br/>
<br/>Afterwards, we went out to the Quabbin, and stamped the Moon and Stars and the Salamander. Good hike, boxes in great shape. The books at both of these boxes are rapidly filling up, and assuming that the current rate of visitors continues, they will need to be replaced before too long.
<br/>
<br/>Off to Connecticut tomorrow!
