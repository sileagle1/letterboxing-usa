Letterbox #5: COVERED BRIDGE<br/>
Placed:       by Sam,  March 30, 2003<br/>
Difficulty:   EASY- good for kids!<br/>
Clues:	from the small handicapped parking lot near the covered bridge, <br/>
- Follow the trail down the EAST side of the river- This is the Kildoo Trail. <br/>
-	Enjoy the scenery<br/>
-	Do not pick wildflowers<br/>
-	The rushing water can be dangerous. (This is not a clue.  It is a statement.)<br/>
-	Soon you will cross a small bridge.<br/>
-	At the bottom of the steps, LARGE rocks on the left.<br/>
-	Continue on trail with LARGE rocks on your left.  <br/>
-	As the LARGE rocks end, look a few paces ahead on the right side of the trail.  You will see a  tree with gnarled old roots protruding into the trail.<br/>
-	Look ahead, approximately 15 paces on the left side of the trail; a nice size rock about 6 high with a tree growing out of the top.  The treasure will be found under a pile of small rocks on the top of the rock under the trunk of the tree.<br/>
-	You should also see a LARGE very dead white tree (due to bark falling off) about 40 paces farther along the trail.  This is just another marker since so many of these rocks look the same.  This tree is BEYOND the treasure. You've gone TOO far.<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox #6 and #7 planned for summer 2003....<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you found this ok.  I LOVE this park!<br/>
