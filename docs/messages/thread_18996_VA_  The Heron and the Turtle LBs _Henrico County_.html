and our last LBs of the day were The Heron and the Turtle series in Three <br/>
Lakes Park.  <br/>
<br/>
Apparently the park ranger or someone had found the Turtle microbox on the <br/>
trail (tiny logbook not in good shape), went online to look up the series and <br/>
replaced it in The Heron box (which was very nice when they could have not cared <br/>
and thrown it away).  <br/>
<br/>
Schizokeet had an extra small notebook and ziploc baggy with her, and she and <br/>
Disclava moved the box to near its original location (too big for the small <br/>
cavity in the tree, its original location).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is planning on finding it this weekend, the New Clues for now are:<br/>
(Follow original clues until you reach the fishing pier).  From the top of <br/>
fishing pier, take about 15 steps diagonally at 360 degrees.  Go down into the <br/>
gully.  Turn right.  The Turtle box is at the base of a poplar tree (do not go <br/>
as far as the 3-in-1 tree).<br/>
