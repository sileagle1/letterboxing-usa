<br/>
Managed to get down to Stafford on Sunday and collect some boxes.  <br/>
Beautiful day to be out!<br/>
<br/>
Fredericksburg Confederate Cemetary - Box is great but even the <br/>
second logbook is now full!  There are some spaces on the back of <br/>
some earlier pages though.  <br/>
<br/>
Blue Heron - Despite having to do math we found this one safe and <br/>
sound.  Had to wait around awhile for all the families to finally <br/>
leave so that we could return it!  There was one group who seemed <br/>
determined to just hang out for the day!  <br/>
<br/>
Akoben - It takes you through a disc golf course so we had to avoid <br/>
the golfers, but the ravine was really pretty!  Box and book are <br/>
doing well!<br/>
<br/>
Antietam Bridge - Box was open and full of water, but thankfully it <br/>
hadnt made it through to the logbook yet!  We dried it all out and <br/>
put some extra ziploc baggies around everything!<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the way we picked up and dropped off the Matchbook HH <br/>
as well. : )<br/>
<br/>
Dead Snellings and Weeds - Pretty confident we found the spot, but no <br/>
box.  Anyone found this one recently?  <br/>
<br/>
Shell<br/>
Knights of Columbo<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
