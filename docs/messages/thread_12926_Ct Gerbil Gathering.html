I second that emotion. If one had to have a "first" gathering this <br/>
was a good one for it to be. Thanks Beth, great job.<br/>

12 hours later .!! Great Day.  I will let others much better with words <br/>
tell the tale,  even the 'dead ' gerbils had tails. !!<br/>
So many highlights and those that know me and my "key troubles' will be <br/>
happy to know that I  was gifted a great key chain crafted by the <br/>
Engraver. It is wanted by many   ;-)  and owned by me .!!<br/>
Thanks everyone for making such a fun day.  Beth , you did good !! So <br/>
great to see friends and make new ones.<br/>
