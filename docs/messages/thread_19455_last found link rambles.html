                    <div class="plaintext-content">This general idea gets tossed around periodically.  I like the suggestion of<br/>
a "last found" rather than a missing or not found, but I agree it should be<br/>
up to the placer to determine if they want to include that info on the clues<br/>
(Many of the local placers around here do, especially after they do<br/>
maintenance)<br/>
<br/>
I understand the frustrations of a missing box--as I often am dragging 2 or<br/>
3 young children along, it can be a less than optimal experience, especially<br/>
if the box is not there.  Yet, I have learned how to use this to teach a few<br/>
of life's little lessons--to my children and to myself.<br/>
<br/>
The adventure, for us, has morphed from a "let's get the box" to  "lets see<br/>
how many bunnies we count today!"  Or "Let's find three oak trees today!"<br/>
We count frogs, plop rocks, try to identify birds and butterflies, sing<br/>
silly songs, practice counting and compass reading.  I also pick parks with<br/>
good play sets or near cool things like beaches or ice cream.  And,<br/>
sometimes I email the placer in advance to check on the status of the box.<br/>
<br/>
I had a rather nice experience the other day--I was surfing the clues page<br/>
and discovered someone had placed a series of boxes practically in my back<br/>
yard less than a week before.  As noone around here had mentioned them, I<br/>
figured I had  "first finder" written allover me and zipped out EARLY<br/>
Saturday morning, feeling awfully smug.  Imagine my surprise when I<br/>
discovered that I was the third and even fourth finder, lol.  To add to the<br/>
irony, one of the first finders was from several hours away.  Yeesh!  I had<br/>
to laugh at myself.  Served me right for being greedy!<br/>
<br/>
Had there been a ;last found notification on the boxes, I probably would not<br/>
have hurried out to find them--I probably would not have gotten out so early<br/>
in he day and experienced the gorgeous fog rising off the lake, or seen the<br/>
waterlillies slowly become visible as the fog lifted.  I would not have seen<br/>
the  dozens of rabbits playing in the meadow, or seen the baby ducks<br/>
learning how to swim.  Instead, I would have waited for a cooler day and<br/>
taken the kids along.  It wouldn't have been the Zen like 90 minutes of<br/>
rejuvenation I so desperately needed.<br/>
<br/>
And, sometimes, there is something to be said for not making this too<br/>
"easy"; for not having clues spoon fed to us, for not knowing exactly where<br/>
a box is, or if it still exists.  I think some of the allure of<br/>
letterboxing, for me, is in the pirate treasure hunt aspect.  The<br/>
"underground" nature of it.  While there is nothing intrinsically wrong<br/>
about a "last found feature", I am not in need of it either.  I appreciate<br/>
having to work just a bit harder for some things these days.    And<br/>
discovering, that while the pot of gold might be missing, the slide down the<br/>
rainbow was one heck of a ride!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi fellow boxers - I have been discouraged lately as the last 4<br/>
&gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have searched for (in two different states) have been MIA - is<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; updated site going to contain a last found area so that we can post<br/>
&gt; &gt; that info - its sad to spend all tht time following clues to not<br/>
&gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  the honeebee<br/>
