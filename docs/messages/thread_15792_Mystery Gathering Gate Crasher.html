                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are expecting many great visitors to our Mystery Gathering - flying <br/>
insects, orange bombshells, departing Kiwis and more.  My medicine man has <br/>
had visions of an unwelcome guest who may be making her presence felt at our <br/>
Gathering.  It is foreseen that the demon Isabelle will make Brother Wind <br/>
howl and the heavens weep unceasingly.  Though she will probably be staying <br/>
far south of us we will wait and see if we need to hide from our unwelcome <br/>
visitor until she is long gone.<br/>
<br/>
Should she visit to the lands south of us we will continue our celebration <br/>
in defiance of her just after her departure.  Even if the heavens are <br/>
disturbed by her we can remain dry and sheltered in the white man's lodge <br/>
where we shall meet.  As mentioned before the lodge contains strange, large <br/>
white metal boxes to keep your offerings cold as the White Bear's lair or <br/>
hot as the Sun Dog's tracks.  If the Sun Dog resumes his unfettered trip <br/>
across the sky you may bring food to cook on the charcoal grills outside the <br/>
lodge also.<br/>
