If you signed up prior to 1/15/03 for a Clue item, please return to<br/>
the Poll and sign up for it again. I did not read all of the do's and<br/>
don'ts in the Help section and did not know that if I changed the<br/>
wording in the instructions, all votes up to that point would be<br/>
deleted. I clarified a point in the instructions on 1/15/03 and voila!<br/>
all votes promptly disappeared. And no, I did not copy anything on<br/>
paper up to that point (but I sure as heck will now!).<br/>
<br/>
I know that SpringChick had Mrs. White and Jay of the DrewClan had<br/>
Prof. Plum. And about half of the others were taken, but I'm just not<br/>
sure who had what.<br/>
<br/>
So if you could on the weekend of 1/18-1/19, please revote. And I am<br/>
so sorry for not doing my homework before making those changes. Send<br/>
me an e-mail at mlgainey@yahoo.com with any questions.<br/>
