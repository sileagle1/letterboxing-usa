&gt; One more time - we followed this 8 mile trip - with no luck. Anyone <br/>
&gt; find this box recently?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I think this is a tough one for people who don't know the area. I happened to <br/>
know the location and went there very soon after it was planted and still had <br/>
trouble finding it. This was in March or so. I know people have been having <br/>
trouble finding it and it may have been lost due to the fact that this area is <br/>
a popular place for late night parties. <br/>
<br/>
One of these days, I'll check on it again. Better yet, the owner should!<br/>
