Cucumber Gap Trail Letterbox<br/>
Nearest town: Gatlinburg, TN<br/>
Smoky Mountains<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: T&amp;A, B&amp;J (the crazy campers, yo)<br/>

Locate Elkmont campground on the north-central side of the park on a <br/>
trail/road map. Drive to the campground, do not enter, turn left instead. <br/>
Drive past the Elkmont Nature Trail and follow the road past the old cabins <br/>
to Jake's Creek Trail/Cucumber Gap Trail. Begin here!<br/>
<br/>
Please note that this was a last minute idea while we were camping in the <br/>
park so this box has no ink pad!<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the gate begins this trail.<br/>
Go over the bridge without a rail.<br/>
Around the bend, past the leaning tree,<br/>
then you'll start heading right, you see.<br/>
<br/>
Around the curves you'll go.<br/>
Its all uphill, you know.<br/>
A sharp left at the Cucumber sign,<br/>
then you'll walk past trees and vines.<br/>
<br/>
On your right, a stump turned upside down.<br/>
Keep walking past piles of branches on the ground.<br/>
Be careful, the trail narrows where<br/>
a small stump to the left on the trail tells you're almost there.<br/>
<br/>
There's a sleeping green monster to the right up ahead.<br/>
This looks like a good spot, but go past him instead.<br/>
When its the trickle of water you hear,<br/>
you'll know that you are very near.<br/>
<br/>
You need to go only a little further yet.<br/>
Be careful not to get your feet too wet!<br/>
As water passes under your shoes,<br/>
look left for the kissing rocks in your view.<br/>
<br/>
Now stand on those rocks and face the nearest tree.<br/>
Look across the path, the box hides under the boulder you cannot see.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
