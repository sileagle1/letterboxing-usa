The geocachers have this neat little program called Cachemate that <br/>
lets them download all the information they want from the geocaching <br/>
website into a PALM PILOT.  It'll display the coordinates, hints, <br/>
placement data, etc, and let you timestamp your find.  It then sorts <br/>
the caches into found/not found for you.  It's pretty amazing <br/>
actually.  I'd love to be able to use it for letterboxing, but it <br/>
would require a total revamp of the letterboxing websites. The file <br/>
types the program uses (.GPX) is specific to the geocaching website <br/>
and it won't work for letterboxing.  (I'd be willing to help on a <br/>
conversion if some savvy computer people would like to take this on)<br/>
<br/>
The next best thing that I discovered today is called Plucker.  What <br/>
it does is use your computer to download html from user specified <br/>
webpages and then dump it into your Palm Pilot.  There, all the text <br/>
and some images are viewable and all the links work.<br/>
<br/>
For example:<br/>
I told the Plucker to download The Central Texas Region from <br/>
letterboxing.org, filter out the images, and set a page depth of 2.  <br/>
It then compiles the information from the Central Texas Region (box <br/>
listing)and every page linked from it (individual clues).  I sync my <br/>
Palm Pilot and all the clues are right there for me to peruse when <br/>
I'm in the field.  The whole thing takes less time than it does to <br/>
print out a few pages of clues.<br/>
<br/>
The only problem I've experienced is that regions with a large <br/>
amount of boxes (Texas Gulf Coast) causes some of the data to be <br/>
left off.  I don't know if this is a program issue, my old Palm <br/>
unit, or my internet.  I'm still playing with it.<br/>

I've often wanted to just log onto LBNA to double-check to see if a <br/>
set of clues were updated since the time I printed them. Usually this <br/>
occurs after two hours of searching but before finally giving up. <br/>

my husband must carry a blackberry for work.  So, if we're<br/>
letterboxing with him, we sometimes email pages from LBNA to his<br/>
blackberry (which is now blue) so that they're available, even in the<br/>
woods where the browser might not work.  To me, that's a relatively <br/>
environmentally-friendly solution as he has to have it anyway.  And if<br/>
I forget the clues (leaving them on the printer or the counter) we can<br/>
still get them.  We just have a rule that he doesn't answer emails<br/>
when we're on a family hike (that's a whole 'nuther thread).  <br/>
<br/>
If it's just me &amp; the kids, I do what hikers n hounds does and copy as<br/>
many clues as possible onto one sheet of paper by reducing the font<br/>
size, cutting out extra information, etc.  Then, if we hide one, we<br/>
use the back of the clue sheet to write down our clues or the kids use<br/>
it for drawing.  Still, it's a lot of paper wasted. . .particularly as<br/>
I sometimes end up printing out clues for the same box more than once<br/>
(if we don't make it there or find it the first trip).<br/>

<br/>
When I go out, I will copy (just highlight, right click &amp; select copy) <br/>
the parts of the clues I want to take with me to Word. I reduce all the <br/>
margins to 0.5 (from page setup), which is the smallest my printer can <br/>
take without giving me error messages. ;) Then, I finally figured this <br/>
out at the beginning of last summer, if you click on the properties <br/>
button in the print window (as in you have already selected print from <br/>
the file menu) you can go to the "finishing" tab and select how many <br/>
pages you want to show on one sheet of paper. Because my eyes are still <br/>
good, I will print up to four pages on each side of paper, giving me 8 <br/>
pages total on one sheet. Without all that, the clues would end up <br/>
being way over 8 pages.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Regarding paperless boxing . . . I almost always have my Palm Pilot with me<br/>
and there area myriad of ways to get info onto it.  For Example:<br/>
AvantGo (https://my.avantgo.com/home/) can download custom web pages<br/>
Plucker (http://www.plkr.org/) already mentioned on this topic<br/>
cut and paste to memo pad<br/>
email it to myself (also works for most phones)<br/>
One of the sites (letterboxing.org I think) has an option to download the<br/>
info into a database format which you could then import into a palm (or<br/>
Pocket PC) application.  (Any geeks out there wanna just write a Palm<br/>
Letterboxing app?)<br/>
I'm sure there are otehr ways too.  If you don't have a Palm old ones can be<br/>
bought on ebay, craigslist, goodwill, etc. for $5-$10.<br/>
<br/>
However . . . that said I'll admit that I still print out the clues on a<br/>
single sheet of paper because my daughter likes to carry it while we look<br/>
and we also stamp in on the clue sheet which we then add to a binder (which<br/>
holds found, looked for, and mia clues).  I keep a box which I collect all<br/>
bad (non confidential) prints and then print on the backside.  I work in the<br/>
print/design industry so I literally have over a case of recycled paper<br/>
sitting in my office, a privelege that most of you don't have, but you can<br/>
always ask a local printer or put a nice box for reusable paper by the<br/>
office printer/copier/etc.<br/>

&gt; When I go out, I will copy (just highlight, right click &amp; select copy)<br/>
&gt; the parts of the clues I want to take with me to Word. I reduce all the<br/>
&gt; margins to 0.5 (from page setup), which is the smallest my printer can<br/>
&gt; take without giving me error messages. ;) Then, I finally figured this<br/>
&gt; out at the beginning of last summer, if you click on the properties<br/>
&gt; button in the print window (as in you have already selected print from<br/>
&gt; the file menu) you can go to the "finishing" tab and select how many<br/>
&gt; pages you want to show on one sheet of paper. Because my eyes are still<br/>
&gt; good, I will print up to four pages on each side of paper, giving me 8<br/>
&gt; pages total on one sheet. Without all that, the clues would end up<br/>
&gt; being way over 8 pages.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I copy multiple clues onto a word document with big wide margins to<br/>

<br/>
The reason a GPX is needed is because the geocache clues are GPS<br/>
based.  That is not needed in boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the way I'd do it if it were my site-wrap the clues in a page<br/>
format similar to printer-friendly, but actually is PDA friendly. <br/>
Link them via an index. Compress.  Send out.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, a simpler way though more bandwidth and server<br/>
intensive way is to simply create a switch for printer-friendly pages<br/>
directly from a special index.  (Kind of like the plain pages but let<br/>
us do ourown wrapping.)  Use Plucker or iSilo to convert the pages<br/>
directly.<br/>
<br/>
It would be pretty simple, really.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

I would find it interesting to figure out how to use a palm pilot and <br/>
download clues.  I seem to remember ex-boyfriend Darrin downloading <br/>
letterboxing clues as a website into his palm pilot, just to see if he <br/>
could do it.  I even think that he used to attach it to his cell phone <br/>
and call up websites at a moment's notice.....<br/>

<br/>
I know a lot of people who integrate the clues into their logbook, or use their binders of <br/>
clues as their logbook too.<br/>
<br/>
It would be a nice feature for the databases to be able to export and download a text file <br/>
of all of the boxes you have selected for output, instead of having to cut and paste or print <br/>
each one individually.<br/>

&gt; How many of us have used up reems and reems of paper printing out <br/>
&gt; clues?  I know I have at least one huge three ring binder full of <br/>
&gt; clue sheets and I think I may have a partial solution to this waste.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The geocachers have this neat little program called Cachemate that <br/>
&gt; lets them download all the information they want from the geocaching <br/>
&gt; website into a PALM PILOT.  It'll display the coordinates, hints, <br/>
&gt; placement data, etc, and let you timestamp your find.  It then sorts <br/>
&gt; the caches into found/not found for you.  It's pretty amazing <br/>
&gt; actually.  I'd love to be able to use it for letterboxing, but it <br/>
&gt; would require a total revamp of the letterboxing websites. The file <br/>
&gt; types the program uses (.GPX) is specific to the geocaching website <br/>
&gt; and it won't work for letterboxing.  (I'd be willing to help on a <br/>
&gt; conversion if some savvy computer people would like to take this on)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next best thing that I discovered today is called Plucker.  What <br/>
&gt; it does is use your computer to download html from user specified <br/>
&gt; webpages and then dump it into your Palm Pilot.  There, all the text <br/>
&gt; and some images are viewable and all the links work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For example:<br/>
&gt; I told the Plucker to download The Central Texas Region from <br/>
&gt; letterboxing.org, filter out the images, and set a page depth of 2.  <br/>
&gt; It then compiles the information from the Central Texas Region (box <br/>
&gt; listing)and every page linked from it (individual clues).  I sync my <br/>
&gt; Palm Pilot and all the clues are right there for me to peruse when <br/>
&gt; I'm in the field.  The whole thing takes less time than it does to <br/>
&gt; print out a few pages of clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only problem I've experienced is that regions with a large <br/>
&gt; amount of boxes (Texas Gulf Coast) causes some of the data to be <br/>
&gt; left off.  I don't know if this is a program issue, my old Palm <br/>
&gt; unit, or my internet.  I'm still playing with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's the plucker website:<br/>
&gt; http://www.plkr.org/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me know what you think.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; ps.  If anyone has the skills or desire to make a cachemate type <br/>
&gt; program for letterboxing, let me know as well.<br/>

copying it as text into something like Word works well too.  <br/>
