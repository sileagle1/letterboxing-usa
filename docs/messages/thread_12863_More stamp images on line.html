I finally got around to scanning, and uploading to my website, 10 more images of stamps I've carved. They are all microbox stamps. They are on the "More Stamps" page at www.ScoutDogsBoxes.com Most will be placed in the Cincinnati Ohio or S.E. Ind. area, but some are going to Michigan at the end of the month to be placed near St Helen.<br/>
