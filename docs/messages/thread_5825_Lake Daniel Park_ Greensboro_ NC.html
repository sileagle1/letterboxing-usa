Can anyone tell me anything about the letterbox in Greensboro, NC?  <br/>
At my Cadette/Senior Girl Scout Year End Closing Picnic, I hid three <br/>
boxes and gave the girls the directions so they could try <br/>
Letterboxing.  They liked it and Greensboro has the closest one to us <br/>
in Virginia.  Before I go off with these girls I wanted some <br/>
information.  I printed off the instructions from the Letterboxing <br/>
web site.  Can anyone shed some more light on this?<br/>
Thanks-A letterboxing newbie.<br/>

Many thanks to the person who is maintaining this box.  As soon as we <br/>
found the right swimming pool-it was a pleasure to look for this <br/>
box.  The Girl Scouts in my troop had a good time for their first <br/>
official box hunt and are ready for some more.  With the time <br/>
constraints we couldn't get to the one at Lake Brandt.  Looking <br/>
forward to another day for that one.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Sally in Virginia<br/>
