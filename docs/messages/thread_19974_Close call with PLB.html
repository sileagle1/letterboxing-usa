COMPLETELY destroyed.  I sent out the Purple Heart Letterbox last <br/>
week, and it has YET to reach its destination.  We've spent all day <br/>
trying to find it.  On the 3rd call to the post office, my boyfriend <br/>
told them day it was sent out.  He was sent to 4 different people, <br/>
and someone finally told him that a number of packages had been <br/>
destroyed that day, and that all were still at the Post Office <br/>
waiting identification.  So to the PO boyfriend went.  Don't worry, <br/>
it's okay, but does have a scratch on the container now.  Not sure <br/>
what happened, but my boyfriend said one package had been ripped in <br/>
half and everything in it broken. Of course, the fronts had been <br/>
ripped off all the packages in the mess, so none of the senders could <br/>
have been identified.  They were nice enough to overnight it free of <br/>
charge.  Hopefully, the Purple Heart will reach its destination <br/>
tomorrow, or by Saturday at the latest.  It'll be sporting its own <br/>
letterboxing wound.  I'm just relieved that it happened at my local <br/>
post office, and not some place between here and there.  I was <br/>
getting totally nervous, because the stories in the log are great.  <br/>
It never would have been found had it happened elsewhere.  Is there a <br/>
purple heart for the purple heart letterbox? <br/>
