                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I know I said that I planned on slowing down in my letterboxing after reaching PFX <br/>
20,000 just this past June, but somehow that's not quite what happened.  Several people <br/>
had teased me about PFX 20K not being the same as F20K, obviously, since I was then <br/>
2000 boxes away from that next big goal, and certainly didn't think I was going to be in <br/>
any hurry to reach it, if my intention as stated was to do only boxes in places I really <br/>
wanted to visit anyway...<br/>
<br/>
Well, man, did that change, and I just ended up doing my fastest 2000 boxes ever! Going <br/>
out to upstate NY for a wedding in late July turned from a long-weekend trip into a <br/>
month-long "letterboxing spree", as I quickly found myself going from dancing at the <br/>
wedding to once again getting stuck on "letterboxing autopilot"!  I just couldn't seem to <br/>
stop myself hopping from box to box, even in some urban areas I really didn't want to <br/>
visit, until finally getting sucked out of the vortex into the Adirondacks, which was where <br/>
I  had really wanted to go in the first place.  Thereafter, I followed up with a few other <br/>
trips up north, and even a short trip with Pete out to Oregon the week after the big <br/>
gathering out there!  And before I knew it, there I was pushing F20,000!!!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to pick a special box for F20K, but didn't feel like driving all the way up north <br/>
again for that last couple hundred finds, so I decided that almost any of the many terrific <br/>
boxes that have come out within the last year or so along the 495 beltway around Boston <br/>
would do, without even having to cross the 95/128 line into any of the urban areas that <br/>
we tend to avoid anyway.  There are certainly enough great boxes around now outside the <br/>
beltway to keep any letterboxer busy for many days, including those in the Andover area <br/>
merrily stocked by The Merry Pranksters, Choi and others, the Sudbury area beautifully <br/>
covered by Dale End Farm, the Westborough/Northborough area delightfully filled by Zess <br/>
and Mim, and the Ashland/Bellingham/Foxboro area plentifully salted and peppered by <br/>
The Travelers 4 and many others!<br/>
<br/>
So, what an exciting last few days of October I ended up having for my final push to <br/>
F20K!  After visiting the wonderful boxes  placed for T2's 13th Birthday Bonanza (the  <br/>
Beatles series, the Seinfeld series, the Boys of Summer Baseball series,  and a whole <br/>
bunch of monsters and other assorted boxes all marvelously planted by Ellen, T1 of the <br/>
Travelers 4)  in several beautiful preserves around Ashland, I hopped on over to <br/>
Framingham for DEFs Clutch of Celtic, and a fun-filled evening of international folk <br/>
dancing with many of us in our Halloween costumes. <br/>
<br/>
Halloween morning itself saw me starting out with "Go, Dog, Go" and "Grateful <br/>
Letterboxes: Singing for the Merry Pranksters" very craftily planted by Zess on a pleasant <br/>
loop around Chauncey Lake, while also finding several other boxes, including a mystery <br/>
that hadn't been found since 2004! The afternoon I spent mostly collecting charms on <br/>
Mim's sweet "Charm Bracelet" series in many lovely preserves scattered around the <br/>
Westborough area, while somewhere in between I managed to scoot up to Northborough <br/>
to get my one remaining box up there - out of the many delightful ones Pete and I had <br/>
done there together recently  - at Harmony's "Up, Up and Away:Celebrate!" near the top <br/>
of Mt. Pisgah, a perfect box for my F20K!  I then went back to finish up the last few <br/>
charms  in Westborough  just before darkness fell and the trick-or-treaters started <br/>
coming out, then quickly changed into my discreet Turkish belly dancer outfit, and <br/>
headed off for yet another wonderful evening of Halloween international folk dance <br/>
partying in Arlington - WOW!  Needless to say, I was really beat by the time I got back <br/>
home to southern RI, and it took me several days to recuperate, but what a grand way to <br/>
ring in F20K!  <br/>
<br/>
So, now it's time to celebrate again, and Pete and I are thinking of having a Little Rhody <br/>
Pumpkin Party at Ninigret Park in Charlestown, RI this coming Sunday, November 9th, <br/>
from around 2 to 4 PM. (Sorry again for the short notice!) I am hoping to have enough <br/>
time between now and then to carve and plant about a dozen little pumpkin stamps <br/>
based on boxes of ours that some people may recognize from the past. However, most <br/>
people know that I'm still not much for carving myself, so if you would like some good <br/>
stamps, please feel free to come on down to the park a bit earlier and plant some of your <br/>
own! It would be great if everyone who felt like it could bring one carved pumpkin stamp <br/>
to plant somewhere in the area for the day (actually the cruder the better, so mine won't <br/>
feel so bad, but beautiful stamps are, of course, most welcome, too!:-) Anyway, please <br/>
feel free to come meet and greet at the picnic pavilion near the pond, just north of the <br/>
Frosty Drew Observatory and Nature Center around 2PM, and join us for some pumpkin <br/>
pie, pumpkin cake, punch, pizza, pretzels, or whatever else anyone might feel like <br/>
bringing - whether or not it starts with "p" and has pumpkin in it, and whether or not you <br/>
choose to wear pumpkin-colored clothing!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

&gt; Well, I know I said that I planned on slowing down in my <br/>
letterboxing after reaching PFX <br/>
&gt; 20,000 just this past June, but somehow that's not quite what <br/>
happened. Several people <br/>
&gt; had teased me about PFX 20K not being the same as F20K, obviously, <br/>
since I was then <br/>
&gt; 2000 boxes away from that next big goal, and certainly didn't think <br/>
I was going to be in <br/>
&gt; any hurry to reach it, if my intention as stated was to do only <br/>
boxes in places I really <br/>
&gt; wanted to visit anyway...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, man, did that change, and I just ended up doing my fastest <br/>
2000 boxes ever! Going <br/>
&gt; out to upstate NY for a wedding in late July turned from a long-<br/>
weekend trip into a <br/>
&gt; month-long "letterboxing spree", as I quickly found myself going <br/>
from dancing at the <br/>
&gt; wedding to once again getting stuck on "letterboxing autopilot"! I <br/>
just couldn't seem to <br/>
&gt; stop myself hopping from box to box, even in some urban areas I <br/>
really didn't want to <br/>
&gt; visit, until finally getting sucked out of the vortex into the <br/>
Adirondacks, which was where <br/>
&gt; I had really wanted to go in the first place. Thereafter, I <br/>
followed up with a few other <br/>
&gt; trips up north, and even a short trip with Pete out to Oregon the <br/>
week after the big <br/>
&gt; gathering out there! And before I knew it, there I was pushing <br/>
F20,000!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanted to pick a special box for F20K, but didn't feel like <br/>
driving all the way up north <br/>
&gt; again for that last couple hundred finds, so I decided that almost <br/>
any of the many terrific <br/>
&gt; boxes that have come out within the last year or so along the 495 <br/>
beltway around Boston <br/>
&gt; would do, without even having to cross the 95/128 line into any of <br/>
the urban areas that <br/>
&gt; we tend to avoid anyway. There are certainly enough great boxes <br/>
around now outside the <br/>
&gt; beltway to keep any letterboxer busy for many days, including those <br/>
in the Andover area <br/>
&gt; merrily stocked by The Merry Pranksters, Choi and others, the <br/>
Sudbury area beautifully <br/>
&gt; covered by Dale End Farm, the Westborough/ Northborough area <br/>
delightfully filled by Zess <br/>
&gt; and Mim, and the Ashland/Bellingham/ Foxboro area plentifully salted <br/>
and peppered by <br/>
&gt; The Travelers 4 and many others!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, what an exciting last few days of October I ended up having for <br/>
my final push to <br/>
&gt; F20K! After visiting the wonderful boxes placed for T2's 13th <br/>
Birthday Bonanza (the <br/>
&gt; Beatles series, the Seinfeld series, the Boys of Summer Baseball <br/>
series, and a whole <br/>
&gt; bunch of monsters and other assorted boxes all marvelously planted <br/>
by Ellen, T1 of the <br/>
&gt; Travelers 4) in several beautiful preserves around Ashland, I <br/>
hopped on over to <br/>
&gt; Framingham for DEFs Clutch of Celtic, and a fun-filled evening of <br/>
international folk <br/>
&gt; dancing with many of us in our Halloween costumes. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Halloween morning itself saw me starting out with "Go, Dog, Go" <br/>
and "Grateful <br/>
&gt; Letterboxes: Singing for the Merry Pranksters" very craftily <br/>
planted by Zess on a pleasant <br/>
&gt; loop around Chauncey Lake, while also finding several other boxes, <br/>
including a mystery <br/>
&gt; that hadn't been found since 2004! The afternoon I spent mostly <br/>
collecting charms on <br/>
&gt; Mim's sweet "Charm Bracelet" series in many lovely preserves <br/>
scattered around the <br/>
&gt; Westborough area, while somewhere in between I managed to scoot up <br/>
to Northborough <br/>
&gt; to get my one remaining box up there - out of the many delightful <br/>
ones Pete and I had <br/>
&gt; done there together recently - at Harmony's "Up, Up and <br/>
Away:Celebrate! " near the top <br/>
&gt; of Mt. Pisgah, a perfect box for my F20K! I then went back to <br/>
finish up the last few <br/>
&gt; charms in Westborough just before darkness fell and the trick-or-<br/>
treaters started <br/>
&gt; coming out, then quickly changed into my discreet Turkish belly <br/>
dancer outfit, and <br/>
&gt; headed off for yet another wonderful evening of Halloween <br/>
international folk dance <br/>
&gt; partying in Arlington - WOW! Needless to say, I was really beat by <br/>
the time I got back <br/>
&gt; home to southern RI, and it took me several days to recuperate, but <br/>
what a grand way to <br/>
&gt; ring in F20K! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, now it's time to celebrate again, and Pete and I are thinking <br/>
of having a Little Rhody <br/>
&gt; Pumpkin Party at Ninigret Park in Charlestown, RI this coming <br/>
Sunday, November 9th, <br/>
&gt; from around 2 to 4 PM. (Sorry again for the short notice!) I am <br/>
hoping to have enough <br/>
&gt; time between now and then to carve and plant about a dozen little <br/>
pumpkin stamps <br/>
&gt; based on boxes of ours that some people may recognize from the <br/>
past. However, most <br/>
&gt; people know that I'm still not much for carving myself, so if you <br/>
would like some good <br/>
&gt; stamps, please feel free to come on down to the park a bit earlier <br/>
and plant some of your <br/>
&gt; own! It would be great if everyone who felt like it could bring one <br/>
carved pumpkin stamp <br/>
&gt; to plant somewhere in the area for the day (actually the cruder the <br/>
better, so mine won't <br/>
&gt; feel so bad, but beautiful stamps are, of course, most welcome, <br/>
too!:-) Anyway, please <br/>
&gt; feel free to come meet and greet at the picnic pavilion near the <br/>
pond, just north of the <br/>
&gt; Frosty Drew Observatory and Nature Center around 2PM, and join us <br/>
for some pumpkin <br/>
&gt; pie, pumpkin cake, punch, pizza, pretzels, or whatever else anyone <br/>
might feel like <br/>
&gt; bringing - whether or not it starts with "p" and has pumpkin in it, <br/>
and whether or not you <br/>
&gt; choose to wear pumpkin-colored clothing!<br/>

&gt; Hey what a great story of great adventures! Isn't Mt. Pisgah a little gem? Great place for <br/>
a milestone! We will be joining you on Sunday Wanda! Can't wait to see you!<br/>
&gt; Ellen<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Mt. Pisgah was definitely a terrific little place for F20K!  We remembered it as a pretty <br/>
area from even before our "letterboxing days", but it got special meaning to us after <br/>
finding the "Mt. Pisgah Fledglings" there in 2001 on one of our earliest MA letterboxing <br/>
trips, back when that was the only box in the vicinity and it had a hand-carved stamp that <br/>
was one of our favorites for many years! Now, of course, the fledglings have flown, but <br/>
there are literally dozens of fun stamps up there that folks can really make a lot of noise <br/>
about-mooing, slurping, chooing and blurping along with Dr. Seuss! (just hope folks can <br/>
keep that story-line straight so those cool carvings don't get treated like a bunch of <br/>
outdoor "tabletoppers"!;-)<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, we are so happy that central eastern MA on either side of the 495 beltway now <br/>
has such a wonderfully dedicated crop of planters who really know how to combine their <br/>
carving skills with sharing some of the loveliest little nature walks around. I would <br/>
definitely rank this area as one of the best new letterboxing "hotspots" in the country, and <br/>
hope that letterboxers will continue to treat this "charming bracelet" /bay circuit greenway <br/>
with great respect for those who have preserved and shared it!<br/>
<br/>
Well, my twelve little pumpkins are carved and ready to go for Sunday, but don't expect <br/>
much compared to those great carvings of MA!  Some of mine are pretty funny, though, <br/>
like the "Bacon &amp; Eggs Pumpkin" or "Pumpkin Opuntia", so come on down for a few laughs <br/>
and a piece of pizza or pumpkin pie. See you soon!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

visit, until finally getting sucked out of the vortex into the Adirondacks, which was where <br/>
I had really wanted to go in the first place. Thereafter, I followed up with a few other <br/>
trips up north, and even a short trip with Pete out to Oregon the week after the big <br/>
gathering out there! And before I knew it, there I was pushing F20,000!!!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to pick a special box for F20K, but didn't feel like driving all the way up north <br/>
again for that last couple hundred finds, so I decided that almost any of the many terrific <br/>
boxes that have come out within the last year or so along the 495 beltway around Boston <br/>
would do, without even having to cross the 95/128 line into any of the urban areas that <br/>
we tend to avoid anyway. There are certainly enough great boxes around now outside the <br/>
beltway to keep any letterboxer busy for many days, including those in the Andover area <br/>
merrily stocked by The Merry Pranksters, Choi and others, the Sudbury area beautifully <br/>
covered by Dale End Farm, the Westborough/Northborough area delightfully filled by Zess <br/>
and Mim, and the Ashland/Bellingham/Foxboro area plentifully salted and peppered by <br/>
The Travelers 4 and many others!<br/>
<br/>
So, what an exciting last few days of October I ended up having for my final push to <br/>
F20K! After visiting the wonderful boxes placed for T2's 13th Birthday Bonanza (the <br/>
Beatles series, the Seinfeld series, the Boys of Summer Baseball series, and a whole <br/>
bunch of monsters and other assorted boxes all marvelously planted by Ellen, T1 of the <br/>
Travelers 4) in several beautiful preserves around Ashland, I hopped on over to <br/>
Framingham for DEFs Clutch of Celtic, and a fun-filled evening of international folk <br/>
dancing with many of us in our Halloween costumes. <br/>
<br/>
Halloween morning itself saw me starting out with "Go, Dog, Go" and "Grateful <br/>
Letterboxes: Singing for the Merry Pranksters" very craftily planted by Zess on a pleasant <br/>
loop around Chauncey Lake, while also finding several other boxes, including a mystery <br/>
that hadn't been found since 2004! The afternoon I spent mostly collecting charms on <br/>
Mim's sweet "Charm Bracelet" series in many lovely preserves scattered around the <br/>
Westborough area, while somewhere in between I managed to scoot up to Northborough <br/>
to get my one remaining box up there - out of the many delightful ones Pete and I had <br/>
done there together recently - at Harmony's "Up, Up and Away:Celebrate!" near the top <br/>
of Mt. Pisgah, a perfect box for my F20K! I then went back to finish up the last few <br/>
charms in Westborough just before darkness fell and the trick-or-treaters started <br/>
coming out, then quickly changed into my discreet Turkish belly dancer outfit, and <br/>
headed off for yet another wonderful evening of Halloween international folk dance <br/>
partying in Arlington - WOW! Needless to say, I was really beat by the time I got back <br/>
home to southern RI, and it took me several days to recuperate, but what a grand way to <br/>
ring in F20K! <br/>
<br/>
So, now it's time to celebrate again, and Pete and I are thinking of having a Little Rhody <br/>
Pumpkin Party at Ninigret Park in Charlestown, RI this coming Sunday, November 9th, <br/>
from around 2 to 4 PM. (Sorry again for the short notice!) I am hoping to have enough <br/>
time between now and then to carve and plant about a dozen little pumpkin stamps <br/>
based on boxes of ours that some people may recognize from the past. However, most <br/>
people know that I'm still not much for carving myself, so if you would like some good <br/>
stamps, please feel free to come on down to the park a bit earlier and plant some of your <br/>
own! It would be great if everyone who felt like it could bring one carved pumpkin stamp <br/>
to plant somewhere in the area for the day (actually the cruder the better, so mine won't <br/>
feel so bad, but beautiful stamps are, of course, most welcome, too!:-) Anyway, please <br/>
feel free to come meet and greet at the picnic pavilion near the pond, just north of the <br/>
Frosty Drew Observatory and Nature Center around 2PM, and join us for some pumpkin <br/>
pie, pumpkin cake, punch, pizza, pretzels, or whatever else anyone might feel like <br/>
bringing - whether or not it starts with "p" and has pumpkin in it, and whether or not you <br/>
choose to wear pumpkin-colored clothing!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey what a great story of great adventures!  Isn't Mt. Pisgah a little<br/>
&gt; gem?  Great place for<br/>
&gt; a milestone!  We will be joining you on Sunday Wanda!  Can't wait to see<br/>
&gt; you!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ellen<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, Mt. Pisgah was definitely a terrific little place for F20K! We<br/>
&gt; remembered it as a pretty<br/>
&gt; area from even before our "letterboxing days", but it got special meaning<br/>
&gt; to us after<br/>
&gt; finding the "Mt. Pisgah Fledglings" there in 2001 on one of our earliest MA<br/>
&gt; letterboxing<br/>
&gt; trips, back when that was the only box in the vicinity and it had a<br/>
&gt; hand-carved stamp that<br/>
&gt; was one of our favorites for many years! Now, of course, the fledglings<br/>
&gt; have flown, but<br/>
&gt; there are literally dozens of fun stamps up there that folks can really<br/>
&gt; make a lot of noise<br/>
&gt; about-mooing, slurping, chooing and blurping along with Dr. Seuss! (just<br/>
&gt; hope folks can<br/>
&gt; keep that story-line straight so those cool carvings don't get treated like<br/>
&gt; a bunch of<br/>
&gt; outdoor "tabletoppers"!;-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At any rate, we are so happy that central eastern MA on either side of the<br/>
&gt; 495 beltway now<br/>
&gt; has such a wonderfully dedicated crop of planters who really know how to<br/>
&gt; combine their<br/>
&gt; carving skills with sharing some of the loveliest little nature walks<br/>
&gt; around. I would<br/>
&gt; definitely rank this area as one of the best new letterboxing "hotspots" in<br/>
&gt; the country, and<br/>
&gt; hope that letterboxers will continue to treat this "charming bracelet" /bay<br/>
&gt; circuit greenway<br/>
&gt; with great respect for those who have preserved and shared it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, my twelve little pumpkins are carved and ready to go for Sunday, but<br/>
&gt; don't expect<br/>
&gt; much compared to those great carvings of MA! Some of mine are pretty funny,<br/>
&gt; though,<br/>
&gt; like the "Bacon &amp; Eggs Pumpkin" or "Pumpkin Opuntia", so come on down for a<br/>
&gt; few laughs<br/>
&gt; and a piece of pizza or pumpkin pie. See you soon!<br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>

&gt; choose to wear pumpkin-colored clothing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
