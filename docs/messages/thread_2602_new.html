Welcome to Letterboxing.  NC really need some more boxes so don't be shy 
about stepping out and hiding a few. There is a lot of good info on our site 
letterboxing.org about what it takes. Don't let carving the stamp hold you up, 
you can always start with store bought stamps. Have fun and I am the webmaster 
for the mid Atlantic and south so I will be happy to put your clues onto a LbNA 
page if you are not into building your own web page...</div>

Hi bluetogether....There are definitely some areas north of Richmond, <br/>
where the hiking is a little flat and scarce for my liking, that'd <br/>
I'd like to hike.<br/>
<br/>
Drop me a note off list KL4321@aol.com and let me know what your <br/>
ideas might be.  Squirrel and I have a cancelled date to explore <br/>
Leesylvania State Park we need to reschedule.  Maybe we can work on <br/>
getting a group of us together soon.<br/>

<br/>
I'm from Arkansas, and don't know a lot about GA, but looked on the <br/>
Internet for information, and figure you might be near Carrollton, <br/>
GA.  I ran a search on AQ, for all letterboxes they had listed within <br/>
a 50 mile radius, and came up with 236.  That's more than 3 times the <br/>
amount in all of Arkansas, so you should have no problem getting into <br/>
the hobby.  :-)  Anyway, here's a link to that search, and you can <br/>
look for yourself.  I made this a "Tiny URL" at tinyurl.com (a place <br/>
that takes long URL's, and makes them small, since email tends to <br/>
truncate URL's, and make them hard to access with a click) but it <br/>
will (hopefully) lead you to the search I made on AtlasQuest.com.  Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
http://tinyurl.com/6zhbsg<br/>
<br/>
Hope this works out for you... Atlas Quest has LOTS of information <br/>
about letterboxing, etiquette, etc, that one will want to read up <br/>
on.  Another place you can search for letterbox clues is:<br/>
