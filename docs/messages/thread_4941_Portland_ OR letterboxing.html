That sounds like fun - we're heading out there again on April 27, but unfortunately
will not be arriving until the evening.  We hope to bag a few Portland/Seattle
boxes during our stay up there instead of coming up empty-handed like we
did a few years ago!

It was a while back that we managed to find this box. And that was on a <br/>
second try. Not an easy find. I would expect that it's still there but <br/>
take a tall person to read your compass and go quick. Eveything is <br/>
leafing out at a furious rate. Funhog<br/>

Last year we had a table inside the building... and that was about it!  We<br/>
were there with other displays, crafts and things for their Earth Day<br/>
celebration.  I made some stamp blanks for potential 'boxers to use out of<br/>
"scratch foam" glued to wood blocks.  We handed out clues, blank sheets of<br/>
paper and pens to a LOT of people.  In between our impromptu explanation of<br/>
letterboxing, we swapped stamps, compared stories and did a little carving.<br/>

little harried, but I think we all had fun.  As soon as I have details I<br/>

We thought perhaps it was connected to Earth Day this weekend.<br/>

The event starts at 10AM and goes to 1PM this Saturday.  I will be there at<br/>
about 9 to set up.  I will have 6 boxes in place for this event.  Most are<br/>
the same as last year, but due to missing boxes, some will have newly carved<br/>
stamps.  Some of the others are still out there, but inaccessible  due to<br/>
high water.  Amanda's boxes are still out there to the best of my knowledge!<br/>
<br/>
The Nature Center provides us a table indoors.  I will have printed clues,<br/>
letterbox info, some ink pads, pens and material to quickly make stamps with<br/>
scratch foam mounted on wood blocks.  We also get a couple of chairs<br/>
(woohoo!).  Last year's weather was iffy to downright downpour.  Plan for<br/>
same.  Last year Amanda (Paisley Orca) carved our event stamp.  As long as<br/>
I've got my carving stuff out I'll do an event stamp for this year.<br/>
<br/>
Please plan to stop by if you are in the neighborhood!  You are welcome to<br/>
camp out at our table for as long as you wish.  There is plenty of<br/>
explaining letterboxing &amp; getting people started to be done... your help is<br/>
appreciated!<br/>

stamps.  Some of the others are still out there, but inaccessible  due<br/>
to<br/>
high water.  Amanda's boxes are still out there to the best of my<br/>
knowledge!<br/>
<br/>
The Nature Center provides us a table indoors.  I will have printed<br/>
clues,<br/>
letterbox info, some ink pads, pens and material to quickly make stamps<br/>
with<br/>
scratch foam mounted on wood blocks.  We also get a couple of chairs<br/>
(woohoo!).  Last year's weather was iffy to downright downpour.  Plan<br/>
for<br/>
same.  Last year Amanda (Paisley Orca) carved our event stamp.  As long<br/>
as<br/>
I've got my carving stuff out I'll do an event stamp for this year.<br/>
<br/>
Please plan to stop by if you are in the neighborhood!  You are welcome<br/>
to<br/>
camp out at our table for as long as you wish.  There is plenty of<br/>
explaining letterboxing &amp; getting people started to be done... your help<br/>
is<br/>
appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Any questions,<br/>
<br/>
please e-mail me!<br/>

I've been doing this crazy hobby/sport/whatever for more than six months and have met almost nobody (although I have made contact with the illustrious Funhog). You can count me in for the Tualatin Nature Center meet. Maybe I can finally meet a few of the greats of the Pacific Northwest.
