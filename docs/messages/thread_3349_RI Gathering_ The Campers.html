<br/>
We spent an absolutely marvelous evening hiking at Burlingame <br/>
yesterday, with the cool clean air and the low sun suffusing the lake <br/>
and forest with a golden glow that brought Bill Bryson to <br/>
mind: "...make no mistake. For a few glorious days each October, New <br/>
England is unquestionably the loveliest place on earth."<br/>
<br/>
For our Gathering, the camp is huge. It's the biggest state park <br/>
campground I've ever seen, and it must be a zoo in the summer. <br/>
Yesterday it was wonderful: a few campers all clustered around <br/>
Trish's recommended campsites on Watchaug Pond at "Fisherman's Camp <br/>
Area" but otherwise quiet and peaceful with a whoosh of breeze in <br/>
pines and oak. I agree that Fish Camp would be the best place to <br/>
count on for camping. The ranger assured me we would have no trouble <br/>
getting sites together for Columbus Day. We liked campsites #97-111, <br/>
on the pond, and the nearby (and quieter/woodsier) #301-310 and #400-<br/>
410.<br/>
<br/>
-The cabins are all reserved: none left for the weekend.<br/>
-No pets are allowed in the camping areas.<br/>
-The Picnic Shelter (where the Gathering festivities will be held) is <br/>
5 miles away by car or a 1.5 mile stroll/pedal/paddle along the <br/>
yellow blazed Vin Gormley Trail.<br/>
-We placed an event box at the picnic area and will have printed <br/>
clues for everyone that weekend. There are TONS of wonderful <br/>
letterboxes in the area.<br/>
-Dusty's, nearby at Dunn's Corner, will be open for Columbus Day <br/>
weekend for after-hike ice cream (then, sadly, they close for the <br/>
season).<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing everyone!<br/>
