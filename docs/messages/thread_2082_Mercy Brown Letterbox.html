<div>Just a word of caution to all future seekers. Be very wary of the Exeter 
Graves Superintendent. He is a very friendly man, yet very dedicated to this 
very historic cemetery. He came upon us as we were stamping in. We were able to 
convince him that we were avid history buffs and were researching the Mercy 
Brown story. His wealth of information is astounding. I do, however, believe 
that he would not receive the idea of a letterbox resting in "his" cemetery very 
well. Use caution and be alert when seeking this box.</div>
