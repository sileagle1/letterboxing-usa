Chillicothe, Ohio (Ross County). Difficulty: easy. *** Please bring <br/>
pen and stamppad. Did you ever hear the old saying that the moon was <br/>
made out of green cheese? Personally, I figure the moon is made out <br/>
of dirt and rocks and stuff. And we have pictures from the Apollo <br/>
missions, right? Of course, I had an uncle who was absolutely certain <br/>
that the moon landing was a fake ( and this was before the <br/>
movie "Capricorn One" came out). And if you had such a large quantity <br/>
of green cheese, I'm not really sure what else you could do with <br/>
it.BLUE cheese is one thing, but green cheese is quite another! But, <br/>
I do know that there IS a tiny little green moon hiding somewhere in <br/>
Ross County....CLUES: Go to Grandview Cemetary. Find the gazebo. <br/>
Standing between the 2 southernmost outer support posts, take a <br/>
reading of 157 degrees. Go 46 paces to a large tree which has grown <br/>
right up against one of the stones. From here, go 46 paces at 150 <br/>
degrees to a large Gingko tree. Stand at the west side of the Gingko <br/>
and take a reading of 172 degrees.Go 26 paces to the tree at that <br/>
heading. Luna Verde is in a hollow space at the base of the tree.<br/>
