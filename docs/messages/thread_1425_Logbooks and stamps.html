Glad you had a chance to run over to the island for Teddy's box. I tried to <br/>
place boxes in the same park that you did as my way of thanking you for <br/>
hiding boxes down here. I have never used the acetone technique. I just use <br/>
tracing paper or draw freehand with a pencil and then turn it over onto the <br/>
stamp and rub it with the back of the pencil or fingernail to transfer the <br/>
image onto the stamp and then use those lineoleom carving tools to carve the <br/>
image. I was useing an exacto knife to carve with but the carving tools work <br/>
best and faster.<br/>
<br/>
I have never had a log book fill up but the way I make them I can always add <br/>
pages. I cut out paper the size I want from scrap paper and add a harder <br/>
cover and then punch holes into it and fasten them together with those little <br/>
nail looking buttons that split in the back to keep it all together. All of <br/>
my log books and stamps are less than a  year old and have had very few <br/>
visitors. Who knows what will happen in time. I have used those spiral <br/>
booklets with lines when I was in a hurry but I don't don't really like them. <br/>
I have been going for quantity rather than quality but that may change as <br/>
more people get involved in the mid-atlantic area. <br/>
Happy hiding,<br/>
Squirrel<br/>
