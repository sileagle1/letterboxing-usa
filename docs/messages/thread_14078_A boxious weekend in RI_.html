school on July 4th to take my final exam) at the beach house, Moonstone Baby and <br/>
I have been on a mystery box rampage!  We found the following boxes in good <br/>
order:<br/>
<br/>
RI Compass Mystery (C and NW)<br/>
Dingoes at Dinnertime<br/>
I am Watching and Waiting For You<br/>
Family and Friends<br/>
RI Wolf Mystery<br/>
<br/>
We also found a few regular boxes along the way!  However, we were set on <br/>
getting mystery boxes!<br/>
<br/>
BTW... yes, I did spend time on the beach too!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting Everyone!<br/>
