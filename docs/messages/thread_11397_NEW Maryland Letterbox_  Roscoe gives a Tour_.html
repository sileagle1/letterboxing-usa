Takoma Park, MD <br/>
Montgomery County <br/>
Placed by The Mobots<br/>
Placed March 23 2003 <br/>
Easy:  10 minutes if you rush through it, but you?ll<br/>
want to take longer.<br/>
<br/>
Takoma Park is partially located in Maryland and<br/>
partially located in Washington DC.  This area is also<br/>
accessible by Metro.  Takoma Park has the feel of a<br/>
really cool small town with all sorts of interesting<br/>
shops and restaurants, but is actually on the border<br/>
of MD and DC. <br/>
<br/>
 To get there from the DC beltway take the New<br/>
Hampshire/650 exit south.  Follow that until you reach<br/>
410/East-West Highway.  Turn right on 410.  410 will<br/>
branch off to the right, but continue straight.  This<br/>
will take you into the heart of Takoma Park.  Look for<br/>
a parking space once you reach the intersection of<br/>
Carrol Avenue and Westmoreland Avenue.  If you pay<br/>
attention on the way in, you?ll see an artist?s house<br/>
with some really cool sculptures in the yard.  On<br/>
Sundays from 10-2 there is a really cool farmer?s<br/>
market here, but parking will be harder to come by.  <br/>
<br/>
In front of the clock in the center of town there is a<br/>
statue of Roscoe the Rooster, a former inhabitant of<br/>
Takoma Park.  Cross the street in the direction that<br/>
Roscoe is facing towards the 2 double benches.  Once<br/>
across the street, turn left.  At the end of the block<br/>
turn right.  Walk to the end of the block.  You are<br/>
now in our nation?s capital.  If you turn left and<br/>
walk 50 feet you will see a really cool rock garden<br/>
(but this is optional).  Turn right and enter the fine<br/>
state of Maryland.  Walk without fear into the nuclear<br/>
free zone.  To your right is some pretty architecture.<br/>
 Walk to the end of the block, look both ways, cross<br/>
the street.  Along the way, you will experience<br/>
deja-vu.  Turn left and continue walking.  Stop along<br/>
the way and enjoy some DELIGHTFUL ice-cream.  On your<br/>
way out, you may want to say hello to Mark.  If you?re<br/>
lucky he will cook for you, he is an excellent chef. <br/>
Continue walking.  Look both ways and cross the<br/>
street.  Have a seat in the gazebo and face the<br/>
street.  Look over your left shoulder and you will see<br/>
a tree surrounded by ivy.  In the fence, behind a log<br/>
is something to remind you of Roscoe.  Be careful! <br/>
Many people walk their dogs in this area, as we found<br/>
out when placing this letterbox.  :P  <br/>
P.S.  Bring your own pen.  <br/>
