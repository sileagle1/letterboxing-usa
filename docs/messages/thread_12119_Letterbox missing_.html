<br/>
I went in search of my first one, which had easy directions so I'm pretty<br/>
sure we were in the right spot, however there has been construction to the<br/>
site recently, and the "spot" is covered in dirt and gravel...<br/>

I recommend either posting the letterbox name and state to this site <br/>
and state you think it's missing or if you have the email address on <br/>
the clues page you can email whoever hid the letterbox and tell <br/>
them.  If you post it to this site, then others who have found it or <br/>
not will most likely reply to tell you that it's missing or still <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps. <br/>
