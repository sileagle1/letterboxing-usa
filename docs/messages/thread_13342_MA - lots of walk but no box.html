<br/>
   Anyone find the Joy fairy at Borderland in Sharon, MA recently?<br/>
Had a great walk up to the Quarry, but couldn't locate in the "tangle <br/>
of rocks". Not saying its missing -- it might just be me -- this <br/>
wasn't my day for boxing. If you did find it recently, drop me a hint <br/>
off line, please about locating the right rocks. Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
    I also tried the new box, Flight of a Bumble Bee in Attleboro, MA <br/>
and came up empty. This can't be missing as it was just placed <br/>
yesterday! I felt sure I was at the right place but maybe I wasn't as <br/>
I couldn't find it.  If anyone else finds that one, please post.<br/>
<br/>
     I am going to sleep well tonight with all that (needed) exercise!<br/>
<br/>
    On the "found" side, my son and I found Weena in Blue Hills over <br/>
the weekend! (Maybe he is my lucky charm and that is why I am out of <br/>
luck today -- he left on a school trip to Montreal).<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>

box too early - car trouble had prevented the placer from making the <br/>
plant! I'll try again in awhile, as I was in the right place -- <br/>
terrain is easy going, for those of you who might want a leisurely <br/>
walk; but bring bug spray.<br/>
<br/>
Guess I will return to look for Joy in Borderland when I can bring a <br/>
few more sets of eyes with me!<br/>
