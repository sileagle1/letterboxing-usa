City of Trees Letterbox <br/>
<br/>
Placed by J&amp;A-bear (jedaryn02@yahoo.com) on 15 March<br/>
2003 <br/>
Boise, ID <br/>
Ada County <br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take Exit 53, Vista Ave, from I84 and head<br/>
north into Boise.  Vista Ave eventually turns into<br/>
Capitol Blvd, but stay on this road.  Turn left onto<br/>
Front St. and then left onto 9th St. and stay in the<br/>
left lane.  Once you cross the bridge theres a small<br/>
parking lot on your left with 2 hour parking. <br/>
<br/>
Description:  You can access the Greenbelt from<br/>
several locations so you can make this letterbox hunt<br/>
as long or as short as you like.  The directions above<br/>
lead you to park very close to the letterbox, but you<br/>
can vary the distance by parking elsewhere and taking<br/>
the Greenbelt trail to the 9th St pedestrian bridge. <br/>
This letterbox received its name because<br/>
French-Canadian trappers named Boise City of Trees<br/>
after they trekked across the semiarid plains, they<br/>
were so excited to see all the trees along the river. <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Along the Greenbelt river trail you can cross<br/>
the river parallel to the 9th St.  Under the south<br/>
side of the pedestrian bridge find the McClellans <br/>
Ferry sign where you can learn about the Boise Rivers<br/>
history.  Follow the dirt trail to the left of the<br/>
sign under the red bridge.  The bottom of the first<br/>
bridge truss you see secures the City of Trees<br/>
letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
Please replace the flat rock when you are done<br/>
stamping in.  Use caution when reaching into dark<br/>
spaces.  Gloves or a stick would be a good idea for<br/>
this letterbox.  <br/>
