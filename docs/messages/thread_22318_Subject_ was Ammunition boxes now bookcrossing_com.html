Subject: Ammunition boxes<br/>
<br/>
 I am in the process of planting a letterbox with a tie-in to<br/>
bookcrossing.com.  Near my letterbox, I was going to plant an ammunition box<br/>
full of paperback books.  Each paperback was going to be baggied, with a<br/>
larger baggie (or two) holding the individually baggied books, so in a<br/>
sense, they would each be double bagged.  I was wondering if anyone out<br/>
there has done much in the way of ammo boxes and whether or not my idea<br/>
would stay dry.  Any input?<br/>
 I was also considering an ammo box to be used for hitchhikers.  Any<br/>
experience or input on that?<br/>

Bookcrossing.com is a really fun idea, and we totally embraced it, to the<br/>
tune of carrying along a book we published, autographed by the author, when<br/>
we traveled along spots he'd visited while thru-hiking the Appalachian<br/>
trail, and dropping off books along the way.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed like a lot of fun, until we found that they were cropping up on<br/>
Amazon.com, in competition to our own books, and at a cheaper price!  So, we<br/>
never heard back from the books we released into the airports inns, and<br/>
parks along the way as someone who found them, but they lost us future sales<br/>
on the book itself.<br/>
<br/>
We love sharing books, but would still like to make some sales for all the<br/>
work we did.<br/>
