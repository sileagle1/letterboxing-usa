What time does the MUCH closer CT gathering begin on the 17th?  I have to be in NYC by 4PM.  If there is going to be an early enough start sat morn, I'ma thinking I might try and sneak a quick visit. (sans kids.... all the more fun!)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The gathering is officially begining at noon, however, we have rented the <br/>
pavillion for the entire day and many Letterboxers are coming early to get <br/>
the Presidents series #1 and #2 and Aarons b'day box before the eating <br/>
begins. So feel free to come early and stamp in a few boxes.<br/>
We have rented the Meadows pavillion. After the guard house is a small <br/>
bridge. The first lot on the left after the bridge is the place and I <br/>
believe it is the Pavillion to the right of the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!!<br/>
