HUGE plea.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As some of you may know, Hillsborough County animal shelter is a no-kill<br/>
facility. HOWEVER, it is kitten season in Florida. so, if their shelters get<br/>
over-filled, they will send their adult cats over to Pinellas County<br/>
shelters. Pinellas County does NOT have a no-kill policy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My friend has been diagnosed with Lupus.  Due to the severity, her doctors<br/>
have told her she needs to get rid of the cats and that she is NOT allowed<br/>
to change the litter boxes (the medication she is on make her more<br/>
susceptible to toxemia - like when a woman is pregnant).   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Melissa and I have contacted every rescue unit in the area and no one is<br/>
able to take the cats.  Currently, they are staying with her parents;<br/>
however, her dad said they have to go - NOW!  And, if she can't find a home,<br/>
it is off to the shelter they go.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, if you would love to adopt a cat or two or know of someone who would<br/>
like to - please contact me (DSCOTT5377@EARTHLINK.NET) for more information.<br/>
I would be happy to get you in touch with Melissa.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE FEEL FREE TO FORWARD THIS EMAIL TO ANYONE YOU KNOW WHO MAY BE<br/>
INTERESTED IN ADOPTING THESE CATS OR MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE<br/>
INTERESTED.<br/>

I have put 2 notices on craigslist - I put the links here, but the stories<br/>
are also below.  It tells you about Tigger and Roo.  PLEASE PLEASE help us<br/>
find a good home for them so they don't have to go to a shelter!! =]<br/>

CRAIGSLIST LISTING #2 (#1 is below)<br/>
<br/>
Hi! My name is Tigger, I am approximately 6 years old (Large sized orange<br/>
and white short haired tabby) and my housemate is is Roo, who is<br/>
approximately 5 years old (Medium sized brown and black Maine Coon mix). <br/>
<br/>
Roo and I currently live with a small dog. And, although we have not ever<br/>
lived with children, we are very kind to our humans nephew when he comes to<br/>
visit. <br/>
<br/>
Roo and I love each other very much and spend our days snuggled up together,<br/>
cuddling, playing and grooming each other. We would love to find a home<br/>
together. However, our time is running very short, so if we have to be<br/>
separated, we would understand. <br/>
<br/>
PLEASE DON'T MAKE OUR HUMAN TAKE US TO THE HUMANE SOCIETY (it is her last<br/>
resort). IT IS KITTEN SEASON - and although Hillsborough is a no-kill<br/>
facility, they do send the overpopulation to Pinellas County (they do<br/>
euthanize). <br/>
<br/>
As my posting title said, our human has Lupus. Her doctors have told her she<br/>
needs to find a new home for us. They say our litter box can make her worse.<br/>
We do not want her to feel any worse, or for her condition to worsen. <br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in us (or one of us), please contact our humans<br/>
friend, Debbi (the email on this ad) - she will send you our picture. If<br/>
after seeing us and having all your questions answered, Debbi will get you<br/>
in contact with our human. Sorry if the process seems long, but Melissa<br/>
needs to rest, so Debbi is trying to do all she can to make this process<br/>
easy on her. It breaks her heart to think of giving us up. <br/>
<br/>
THERE WILL BE AN ADOPTION FEE. This is required to make sure that you are<br/>
taking the cats as pets, not for research or any other unthinkable act.<br/>

CRAIGSLIST LISTING #1<br/>
<br/>
Melissa has been diagnosed with Lupus and is in desperate need of finding a<br/>
new home for her 2 wonderful cats. The thought of having to give up her cats<br/>
is very hard for her, but she knows that her medical condition requires her<br/>
to do this. Below is a short summary she has written about her cats. <br/>
<br/>
Want to see a picture of Tigger and Roo? Email me and I will send you one. <br/>
<br/>
I am located in Colorado; so unfortunately, I can't interview you or answer<br/>
any questions you may have. However, if you are interested in Tigger and<br/>
Roo, please email me and I will get you in touch with Melissa. <br/>
<br/>
I want to make sure her cats find a place that we know they will be safe and<br/>
happy. <br/>
<br/>
Please note: THERE WILL BE AN ADOPTION FEE. This is required to make sure<br/>
that you are taking the cats as pets, not for research or any other<br/>
unthinkable act. <br/>
<br/>
ABOUT THE CATS: <br/>
<br/>
Please help! I have two beautiful, extremely healthy adult cats that, due to<br/>
my medical condition; I can no longer care for. These two cats are extremely<br/>
loving, affectionate, and friendly, raised completely indoors and are litter<br/>
box trained. Both are spayed males, not declawed, and are current on all<br/>
their shots. Tigger is approximately 6 years old (Large sized orange and<br/>
white short haired tabby) and Roo is approximately 5 years old (Medium sized<br/>
brown and black Maine Coon mix). They both have lived with a small dog and<br/>
been great around my nephew since he was a baby although they have not lived<br/>
with children. As you can see by their photo both cats are inseparable; they<br/>
spend their days snuggled up together, cuddling, playing and grooming each<br/>
other. How cute! Of course they also love attention of humans. I wish them<br/>
to find an approved home together. <br/>
