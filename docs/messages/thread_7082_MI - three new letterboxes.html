<div>Placed August 13, 2002</div>
<div>Traverse City, Michigan    </div>
<div>Grand Traverse County</div>
<div>Planted by Esperanza</div>
<div>Easy</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Directions</strong></div>
<div>In Traverse City locate the post office downtown, which is 
just south of the main street before the Boardman River as you head into what is 
called "Olde Town".  Park in parking lot K across from the post 
office.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Clues</strong></div>
<div>After parking, walk towards the fenced-in power station at the 
end of the lot.  Go down the stairway between the station and the 
trees.  At the bottom take the path to the right (past the bush).  
Turn and look back at the stairway.  There are four sections of the 
straight walkway in front of you.  Look under the last section, and the 
enormous willow behind you will help hide your search.  </div>

<div><strong>Mighty Mac</strong></div>
<div>Placed August 16, 2002</div>
<div>Straits State Park, St. Ignace</div>
<div>Mackinac County, Michigan</div>
<div>Planted by Esperanza</div>
<div>Easy, 15-20 min. stop, some stair-climbing</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Directions</strong></div>
<div>Straits State Park is located in St. Ignace Michigan on the 
shores of Lake Michigan just north and east of the Mackinac Bridge.  After 
crossing the bridge, take a left (or east) into St. Ignace.  The turn-off 
to the park is on your right before you reach the town.  Enter the park 
(there is a day-use fee), and follow the signs to the "bridge overlook picnic 
area"  Park near the overlook.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Clues</strong></div>
<div>Enjoy the view of Mighty Mac from the overlook deck.  
Take the steps down.  At the bottom is a trail, take the path to the right 
which follows along the bottom of the cliff.  Keeping the cliff to your 
right you'll observe many rock slides.  Stay on the path until you see the 
paved campground road  (not the parking lot side trail).  As you come 
to the road there is a large rock formation on your right, right next to the 
path with small cedar trees growing on and around it.  Walk around the back 
side of the rock and find the box in the rocks.  Stay out of view and 
replace the rocks.  Tossing some cedar leaves around the replaced 
rocks when done helps make them look more natural.</div>

<div><strong>Top O' The Pickle</strong></div>
<div>Placed August 16, 2002</div>
<div>Highway U. S. 2, east of Naubinway</div>
<div>Mackinac County, Michigan</div>
<div>Easy, 15-20 minute stop</div>
<div>Planted by Esperanza</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Directions</strong></div>
<div>The box is planted in a roadside park on the south side of 
Highway U. S. 2, approx. 41 miles west of the Mackinac Bridge.  There are 
several rest areas along this stretch of highway, the box is in the last rest 
area before you reach Naubinway (or the rest area past Little Hog Island).  
This section of highway along Lake Michigan is gorgeous, and many people have 
discovered the joy of keeping the swimming suits and towels packed close to the 
top of the luggage for a dip along these beautiful beaches!  This rest area 
marks the northernmost point of Lake Michigan, which resembles a pickle (or 
squash) with leaves, as described in the classic children's book about the Great 
Lakes, <em>Paddle to the Sea</em> by Holling Clancy Holling.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Clues</strong></div>
<div>Take the trail at the west end of the parking lot.  It 
isn't marked, but does have a wood path of wood chips.  The trail will 
follow along the lakeshore heading west with a bank of tree-covered sand on the 
left.  There are many fallen logs on the right hand side of the 
trail.  As the trail begins up a rise and opens out to the beach look to 
your right for a log completely fallen over 4 paces to the right of the 
path.  One side of the log has a "tent" of brush next to it, look for the 
box.  Stamp in and enjoy the beach!  If you ascend up the trail to 
just beach on the left with a grove of pine trees you've gone too far.  
Note:  the stamp surface is a bit uneven, you'll have the best result if 
you rock the stamp side-to-side a bit as you stamp.</div>
