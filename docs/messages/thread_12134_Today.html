                    <div class="plaintext-content">F. Fox, R. Bunny, &amp; Ladybug98, and Irish Tinker header out today and started in Eastford. We visited the Needeeps Frog Rock, and Mississippi boxes. Both were fun and in great shape! Rosie Bunny &amp; Ladybug98 loved the frog rock and boy did I miss a great photo op! We also tried to locate another unpublished box in the area but it escaped us. Then we made a "quick" stop at Kathy Johns to pick up a new ink pad and I may have lost a bit of control in there and found a few things that were "a must" F. Fox rolled his eyes!<br/>
Then we visited Mt Hope Park &amp; did the series of 4 there. That park should be called "The Kingdom of Ticks" RB had 3, FF had 1 and I had 2! We found all boxes. Great story!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today Rosie Bunny, Ladybug98, Squirrel the Nut, RTRW and I went out and picked up Bailey's Ravine. The stamp is broken in 1/2. We had great hopes of getting Under the MT but the flooding caused the water to rapidly rush over the dam and since we had a tiny 3 year-old legs in tow we opted not to make the leap. S the Nut and RTRW also picked up my Tell Tale Apples. <br/>
We had quite the cool experience at Bailey's. While we were stamping in, sitting next to the waterfall we got to listen the beautiful sounds of a flute. The was a person just sitting way out in the woods playing a haunting tune on some kind of a flute. <br/>
Not your average CT boxing day profit wise but we had a great day anyway. Thanks to all the planters.<br/>
