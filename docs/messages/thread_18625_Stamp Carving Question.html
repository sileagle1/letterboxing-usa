It's funny...I asked this very same question when I first started on <br/>
this talk list. I got a bunch of helpful responses, but I'll just speak <br/>
for myself here.<br/>
Inverse stamps are just as appropriate as any other style of stamp. The <br/>
fact that the stamp is hand-carved is what is special. However you want <br/>
to carve it is up to you. Some images do look better as inverse stamps. <br/>
However, realize that with inverse stamps most of your images will have <br/>
a boxed look. <br/>
Utilizing inverse stamps with regualar stamps can make for a creative <br/>
expression. And, as the Drew crew showed me, mixing inverse within a <br/>
regular stamp can be even cooler!<br/>
I've carved a couple of inverse stamps, but personally I prefer the <br/>
regular method b/c I like to carve away the excess stamp material in an <br/>
artistic way. That's just me though.<br/>
Just do what you feel is best and good luck.<br/>

Some people are able to wield a Xacto Knife with the finesse of a Jedi<br/>
Knight and his light saber. I, however, can only use the Xacto knife to<br/>
carve the larger chunks away from the finished stamp.<br/>

Go for it.  Lots of stamps out there are inverse stamps.  (Actually, <br/>
I like to call them 'negative image' stamps, but that's just me.)<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, they're easier to carve, but in other ways, they're <br/>
much more difficult.  I know, it sounds paradoxical, but it's true!<br/>
<br/>
Technically speaking, they're easier to carve, but it's a lot harder <br/>
to actually make them look good.  If not done carefully, the stamp <br/>
will look blockish, simple, and something less than impressive.  How <br/>
do you do a good job with a negative-image stamp?  I can't really <br/>
explain it in words very well, but as you find them you'll see what <br/>
I mean.  Some look absolutely amazing while others fall flat. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

stamps too, it sounds like a lot of fun :D  I already have an idea <br/>
for another stamp, a bookcrossing logo stamp that says "media mail" <br/>
as well for all of the bookcrossing I do as well.  Are there any <br/>
other bookcrossers out there?  I discovered letterboxing from the <br/>
bookcrossing site recently.  <br/>

I have a letterbox I used one in that I liked (it's in La Jolla, near <br/>
San Diego).  I couldn't decide which way I liked an image better <br/>
so I carved it both the regular way and as an inverse stamp.  <br/>
Then I stamped them right next to each other and again under <br/>
them, but in the reverse order.  I liked how the stamp came out.  <br/>
It was kind of like a four-pane stained glass window.<br/>

The first stamp I carved was a 'normal' stamp, but most of the rest <br/>
have been inverse. I did one that way after having trouble making the <br/>
first stamp look decent and stuck with it because I found that simple <br/>
designs were often very striking when done as an inverse - the stamp <br/>
remained sturdier as well. I will probably wind up doing stamps of both <br/>
sorts, but who knows.....<br/>
<br/>
Each LBer is going to like different things about carving, so let's all <br/>
just carve stamps we like and not worry about ranking techniques. <br/>
Hopefully, the fun of the hunt means that finding *any* stamp (even <br/>
mine, lol) is a good thing. :-)<br/>

As with the other posters, the dark background does make an inverse image <br/>
