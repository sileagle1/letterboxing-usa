Difficulty: 2  the gravel path is pretty steep<br/>
Near Bethel, Clermont County, OH<br/>

15 degrees F, beautiful sunshine for my last letterbox of the year!<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is in the same park as the Owl's Nest by franzsolo.  <br/>
For directions to the East Fork park, see his box.  You can park in <br/>
the same spot for both letterboxes or if your legs are a bit more <br/>
feeble, you can get back in the car and drive to the top of the East <br/>
end of the earthen dam.  Parking there is a little dicier as I did <br/>
not see a parking spot right where the directions start.  (But I <br/>
didn't see no parking signs either.)<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the STOP sign at the gate at the east end of the dam.  There <br/>
is a post there with a red tape around its middle.  Go 10 degrees for <br/>
39 hard paces up a gravel bank  or find a slightly easier way up on <br/>
top of the bank.  There is a post labeled #6 at the corner of a path <br/>
right there.  <br/>
<br/>
Make sure you take a good view of the lake from this vantage point.  <br/>
Then go back to the post and go directly west 18 paces (1 pace = 2 <br/>
steps, about 5 feet) to an old rotting tree on the forest floor.  <br/>
Inside the near end of that tree, hidden by a rock, you may find the <br/>
East Fork letterbox if the raccoons have let it be.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.<br/>
There is a geocache within 500 feet of this spot if you want to go <br/>
for it.  "East of the Fork and West of the Spoon" by Girl Scout Troop <br/>
1989.  Coordinates for that cache are:<br/>
N 39 deg 01.366 min W 84 deg 08.827 min.<br/>
