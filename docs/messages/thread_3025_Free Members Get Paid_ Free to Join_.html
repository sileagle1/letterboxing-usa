<p align="center"><a href="http://www.goingplatinum.com/member/slhomebiz"><b>SIGN UP 
      NOW</b></a><br/><br/>For the first time ever, I received a piece of email 
      that actually delivered<br/>more than just empty promises.<br/><br/>I assure 
      you, you can earn a five-figure monthly income on a one time small<br/>fees 
      budget, at home, in your spare time and you can do this without 
      sending<br/>cash in the mail to strangers for recipes<br/>or any of the 
      usual nonsense!<br/><br/>The company I'm with doesn't push products, 
      expensive kits, or high monthly<br/>fees on us, but instead, they teach us 
      how to become successful with ANY<br/>business on or off the 
      Internet.<br/><br/>It's no wonder why they have lasted longer than nine out 
      of ten online<br/>networking companies!  We're getting an inexpensive 
      lifetime education,<br/>along with weekly and monthly checks while we 
      practice what we learn.<br/><br/>After receiving what I assumed was the same 
      e-mail on numerous occasions and<br/>deleting it each time, I finally read 
      it because of the catchy subject line.<br/>It wasn't one of those corny 
      "send money in the<br/>mail to strangers" schemes that I had seen 
      before!<br/><br/>This one was entirely different, and it was so 
      EASY!<br/><br/>I'm telling you from experience, you don't need to know 
      anything about<br/>computers, Internet Marketing, or anything. What you 
      need to know, you will<br/>learn right away from the company and everyone 
      in your organization who are<br/>anxious to help.  This is too 
      EASY!<br/><br/>Within 72 days of signing up, my direct upline have 195 
      subscribers!<br/>Including 78 Bronzes level I figure, if he can do this, 
      ANYONE can!<br/>Everyone gets the exact same training and 
      materials!<br/><br/>I was not prepared for the results! For the last two 
      weeks, my email box has<br/>been jammed with requests!<br/><br/>I knew this 
      was the part time OPPORTUNITY that I had been looking for.<br/><br/>I 
      promise you, if you set aside a little time each day to do what I am 
      doing<br/>a follow up on the request those who ask you for more info, you 
      will make<br/>money.<br/><br/>SERIOUSLY! If you would like to quickly build a 
      five-figure<br/>monthly income with a low investment as one time $25 fees, 
      and you can send<br/>an e-mail message, then you are on your way to the 
      bank with weekly and<br/>monthly commission checks for the rest of your 
      life!<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.goingplatinum.com/member/slhomebiz">THIS IS POSITIVELY 
      THE BEST MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY EVER!</a></b><br/><br/>You may be 
      skeptical. After all, you've probably been led by friends,<br/>family, and 
      the media to believe that most opportunities on the Internet are<br/>either 
      scams or involve a hefty financial investment. This one is 
      neither!<br/><br/>I used to feel exactly the same way, however, since trying 
      this system<br/>myself, I have found that I was listening to the wrong 
      people. This company<br/>is changing the way to do business!  Every 
      check has been delivered on time,<br/>serving thousands of people every 
      month since the beginning.<br/><br/>It is a time of prosperity and the 
      Internet is making ordinary folks into<br/>millionaires at a record pace. 
      This will produce results, but you can't make<br/>a dime with 
      this.......until you get started yourself!<br/><br/>What most Internet users 
      don't realize is that from the moment you log on<br/>until the moment you 
      log off you are generating a good deal of cash, even if<br/>you do not buy 
      or fill out anything!<br/><br/>Competition on the Internet has grown to the 
      point that web-based companies<br/>are paying sizeable "referral fees" and 
      "commissions" to<br/>the ISP (Internet Service Provider), Portal, Search 
      Engine, or even the<br/>personal web page owner that directs you to their 
      site. If you<br/>happen to buy something, provide a little information, or 
      take advantage of<br/>a useful service, the money changing hands is 
      thatmuch greater.<br/><br/>Whether a big banner advertisement or a simple 
      highlighted text link, if you<br/>clicked on it or even just viewed it, 
      that web page owner is more than<br/>likely cashing in. Some of the larger 
      ISPs make so much money from these<br/>advertisements and links it is 
      almost unimaginable that they also charge you<br/>a monthly fee for the 
      privilege ofallowing them to be your Internet gateway.<br/><br/>Your 
      membership in Going Platinum will change your view of the 
      Internet<br/>forever by enabling you to profit from it whether you are 
      online or not.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://www.goingplatinum.com/member/slhomebiz">GO ENROLL

      cooperative online community that<br/>pays you the "referral fees" and 
      "commissions" that you and your friends'<br/>presence on the Internet 
      generate. It is designed to turn every Internet<br/>session into an 
      income-producingevent.<br/><br/>The Going Platinum Community is an 
      opportunity to own the Internet, or at<br/>least your own piece of  
      it. It is a full service ISP, Internet Gateway,<br/>Search 
      Engine/Directory, Shopping Mall, Virtual Office, and just 
      about<br/>anything else you can think of, all rolled into one easy-to-use

      and Internet<br/>tools that you never dreamed existed; you'll have access 
      to anything and<br/>everything that the Internet has to offer. From chat 
      rooms, news groups and<br/>clubs to Chinese cooking and WesternEuropean 
      architecture. From Wall Street to Hollywood and Baseball toCricket, it's 
      all yours, and we mean that literally. You'll own it and therevenue that 
      is generated from every feature will be paid to you!<br/><br/>"Ownership" in 
      the Going Platinum Community is like owning a television<br/>network, 
      newspaper, magazine, shopping mall, sports arena, real estate or<br/>travel 
      agency and about 100 different billboards all at the same time. It 
      is<br/>an income generating opportunity inso many ways.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.goingplatinum.com/member/slhomebiz"><b>GO ENROLL

      participating. It also helps you to earn much, much<br/>more in the GPC 
      even if you play the most passive of roles in the program.<br/><br/>What 
      makes Going Platinum innovative, and different from anything that 
      you<br/>might have seen before, is that it comes with its own safety net to 
      ensure<br/>your success. The GPAP (Going Platinum Affiliate Program) builds 
      your Going<br/>Platinum Organization for you, even ifyou do not have the 
      time or elect not to put forth an effort in building ityourself. Of 
      course, if you choose to play an active role, your incomestream will grow 
      that much faster.<br/><br/>The GPAP can turn a $300 per month Going 
      Platinum  income into well over<br/>$3000 per month. It can turn a 
      $3,000 per month Going Platinum income into<br/>well over $30,000 per 
      month! The bottom line is that if you want to take<br/>your Going Platinum 
      earnings to a whole new level, your participation in the<br/>GPAP is a 
      must!<br/><br/>The Going Platinum Affiliate Program is also the means by 
      which you pay for<br/>your "ownership" in the Going Platinum Community. 
      Although your 1st Position<br/>in the GPC is free, there are monthly 
      membership fees associated with the<br/>"ownership" of additional 
      Positions. But please do not be alarmed. Your<br/>ongoing monthlymembership 
      fees will be deducted from the commissions you earn and willgenerally be a 
      very small percentage of the money that you make.<br/><br/>Go have a look
