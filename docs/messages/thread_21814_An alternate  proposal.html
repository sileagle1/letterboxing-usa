While this post did not specifically pertain to the game of <br/>
letterboxing and I personally would not care to share that kind of <br/>
information with the group, it is from a letterboxer who has for <br/>
whatever reason chosen to share.  I see no difference in this than <br/>
when a group member makes a post about a new baby,a wedding or a <br/>
death in the family, which we have seen on several occasions.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone has a different level of personal involvement with this <br/>
game and the other players and this list is how people who play the <br/>
game of letterboxing communicate with one another.  While that is <br/>
primarily regarding the techicalities of the game, for some there is <br/>
also a personal involvement.<br/>
<br/>
I think an alternate proposal would be that when there is a post of <br/>
this nature -- just ignore it if you don't know the person or don't <br/>
care.  If you do know them or would like to show support, e-mail <br/>
privately.<br/>

&gt;  Hello everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am just sending this message off to most of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; groups I am <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; involved with.  I am going through a VERY tough<br/>
&gt; &gt; time right, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; separating from my partner of five years.  There<br/>
&gt; &gt; are four children <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; involved, two of my children and two<br/>
&gt; &gt; step-children, so its not <br/>
&gt; &gt; just <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; breaking up a couple, but a whole family. I do not<br/>
&gt; &gt; know what the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; future holds for us, there's the possibly of<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting back together <br/>
&gt; &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the future, but I am also a realist and know that<br/>
&gt; &gt; may not happen <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; also.  We are ALL going to counseling and hope<br/>
&gt; &gt; that helps.  <br/>

  I think this is the best response of all, and my personal motto when it comes to stuff like this.<br/>
<br/>
  Honestly, I am amazed at how cruel people are on this list.<br/>

"Snip" <br/>
See full post all the way below<br/>
<br/>
This was me, I looked at this and thought to myself, if I just send<br/>
you a private post, how am I going to not only publicly support what I<br/>
believe in but also get people thinking about things that I believe<br/>
are right.<br/>
<br/>
I confess that I am the type of person who writes letters to the<br/>
editor in newspapers. What is the point of just trying to change one<br/>
person's mind when I might be able to influence 150?<br/>
On the flip side I should probably thank people who give me the<br/>
opportunity!<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Re: An alternate proposal<br/>
<br/>
Ok, after Aisling and Spring Chick's posts I'll modify what I wrote.<br/>
I can see your points, ladies. I am sorry if I have given the<br/>
impression that I don't care about people. That certainly is not<br/>
true.<br/>
I guess I am uncomfortable with knowing *as much* information as was<br/>
given by the OP. I think regional lists are still better suited to<br/>
this sort of information.<br/>
I will modify to say post limited information to explain absences and<br/>
allow those who are close to seek out the story from their friends?<br/>
While I don't need to know specifics about each event (I don't need<br/>
labor videos, thank you! lol) it is nice to know about significant<br/>
events such as weddings, births, deaths. I can then send personal<br/>
messages of congratulations or condolences.<br/>
BTW- welcome back, Aisling. Your art has always inspired me! I would<br/>
love to find a stamp or two of yours!<br/>
1.)Cross posting the same message (with very personal<br/>
information, nonetheless) to every list you belong on<br/>
is considered bad nettiquette. Using your own address book suffices.<br/>
Word will get out to those who need to know. There are over 2500<br/>
people here. That's too many to know your personal information.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Stick to letterboxing here- it's your best bet.<br/>
Form your friendships on the regional lists. You'll<br/>
be much happier.<br/>
<br/>
3.) Many of you who decided to reply not only replied<br/>
but posted two or three other posts with yours. This<br/>
makes digests unwieldly and quite frankly is VERY rude<br/>
to those of us who choose digest (especially after<br/>
Yahoo changes) and anyone concerned with possibly<br/>
using the search function later on.<br/>
<br/>
4.) Don expressed his opinion and asked that any retort to it be<br/>
emailed to him directly. That means, DON'T POST IT TO THE LIST.<br/>
<br/>
5.) Flame me, respond, whatever- to my own email<br/>
address. Let the list alone.<br/>
<br/>
6.) Give the webmasters a break. Ok, that wasn't on<br/>
topic but they are very busy people and give so much<br/>
of themselves. Give them time to fix a problem- it<br/>
won't help having 100 people post the same problem.<br/>
<br/>
Back to your regularily scheduled letterboxing<br/>
program.<br/>
