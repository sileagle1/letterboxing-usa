stamps for my upcoming boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Great thanks to Choi, Scarab, Brandy You're a Fine Girl, Team<br/>
Randalstik, and Talking Turtle.<br/>
<br/>
A number of boxes are planned and these wonderful carvers are will<br/>
provide fantastic images worth seeking.  Choi and Scarab have carved<br/>
for me before and their work is superb -- and I'm sure most of you<br/>
know that the work of the other three are top notch as well.<br/>
<br/>
Look for the boxes to be announced upon their placement, from later<br/>
this autumn through next spring, or catch the preview on my website: <br/>
http://home.comcast.net/~scott.e.hall/Placed.html<br/>
<br/>
Although I seek to improve my own ability to carve, I enjoy using the<br/>
fine work of others.  If anyone else out there is willing to carve for<br/>
me, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to those carvers listed above!  I'm excited to place the<br/>
boxes with your fine work!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
