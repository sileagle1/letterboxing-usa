I wonder if he really means not actually sit-repping, not not using the word <br/>
itself? (Run THAT sentence through your grammer checker, dare ya!).<br/>
<br/>
It was a true pleasure to meet the long-legged, fast-walking, quick-smiling <br/>
Ryan during a couple of "off trail" days he was spending in CT with the lovely <br/>
Amanda from Seattle. Thanks to JustBeth, Davidjohn, Max, Brian, Lori, Ryan, <br/>
Rubaduc, and Chepolide for a wonderful afternoon! Pizza, sushi, and smeared ink: <br/>
the ultimate picnic lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Jay in CT, who could never toss off "those next few states in a week or so <br/>
each"<br/>
