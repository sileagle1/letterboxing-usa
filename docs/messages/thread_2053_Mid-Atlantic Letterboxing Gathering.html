Mark your calendar for Saturday, May 19, 2001.  The location will be <br/>
Leesylvania State park http://www.dcr.state.va.us/parks/leesylva.htm <br/>
in Northern VA.  The Park has six boxes hidden there already.  Sadly, <br/>
Squirrel (who's responsible for so many great boxes in the Mid-<br/>
Atlantic region) has a conflict on the 19th, but she and I (and do <br/>
your best to join us, Jay) will be meeting there to plant some more <br/>
before the gathering.  The Jolly G-Man (Jay C.) is making <br/>
arrangements to rent a shelter for the gathering, so we should be <br/>
good to go, rain or shine!  He's also agreed to prepare the <br/>
official "event stamp", and is open to design ideas....so send him <br/>
your thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
There are no overnight/camping facilities at the Park, but you'll see <br/>
from the website that there's plenty available closeby.<br/>
<br/>
We're open to any ideas to make the day a success.  We're thinking <br/>
we'll gather around mid-day, with plenty of time to meet, hunt, <br/>
exchange, and play before starting an early evening picnic meal.  We <br/>
can all pack our own picnics and it'd be fun to bring a favorite side <br/>
dish or dessert to share.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who responded to the poll.  It was exciting to see <br/>
that some of our letterboxing neighbors from up north are thinking of <br/>
joining us.  When you know for sure that you'll be able to attend the <br/>
gathering, please e-mail me directly Btrplc2b@aol.com with the number <br/>
in your family/group and ages of any children so we're sure to have <br/>
some fun planned for all ages.<br/>
<br/>
Kathy (Ladybug)...in looking forward to meeting you in Virginia!<br/>
