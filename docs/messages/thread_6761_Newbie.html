    I discovered this sport in the summer and I too was chicken to try my<br/>
hand at carving.  But with lots of encouragement from kind Legerdemaine I<br/>
took the plunge.  My first stamps were pitiful, but I caught the carving bug<br/>
and each attempt is a big imrpovement over the previous one.  People have<br/>
been kind enough NOT to laugh at my first attempts,  and I have left them in<br/>
my first boxes for sentimental reasons.  Just go buy some "pink stuff" and<br/>
go for it!  You'll have fun.<br/>

Welcome! Most letterboxers would rather find a hand carved stamp than a<br/>
store bought stamp; but would rather find a store bought one than no stamp<br/>
at all. Don<br/>

&gt;Hi Patti!  Welcome to the group, and to letterboxing.  It's a lot of<br/>
&gt;fun as I'm sure you and your son will find out in the coming<br/>
&gt;weeks/months...  What part of the country are you from?<br/>

<br/>
I am new to both this list and to letterboxing.  I read <br/>
about "questing" in the recent Family Fun issue and was intrigued <br/>
enough to check out the links. Imagine my surprise to find a bunch of <br/>
boxes in my area (Greater Cincinnati, OH)  Loaded up the kids the <br/>
next day and we found our first letterbox!  Have had two unsuccessful <br/>
hunts since but am hooked I beleive.  I find myself pouring over <br/>
clues in the wee hours deciding where to go next.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I am looking forward to learning more--and hoping you will <br/>
all be patient with me as I explore this fascinating pasttime.<br/>
<br/>
First question:  I need a stamp but really don't ahve th time or <br/>
interest in carving my own.  Where can I get a custom stamp?  I have <br/>
a vision, lol!<br/>

My family and I learned about letterboxing from a recent issue of <br/>
Family Fun magazine.  Unfortunately, there are not too many boxes <br/>
near our home  :-(.  We did find our first letterbox yesterday - the <br/>
Indiana Mystery box!  <br/>
<br/>
We are planning to place our first box today.  <br/>
<br/>
I do have one question, though.  Are we supposed to include an <br/>
inkpad in our box, or are the finders supposed to bring their own?<br/>

Thanks for the replies - this is so much fun.  If you're in Springfield,<br/>
Ohio, stop in my store and say hi!  Exit 62 off of Route 70.  Head into<br/>
Springfield and I'm 3 miles off the exit on the right in a little strip<br/>
mall.  If you pass a large fire station you just passed it.  Hours:  2pm-7pm<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to the hobby Suzanne!  You picked a great place to start -<br/>
John Bryan State Park is a great park and is full of letterboxes.<br/>
There are plenty of more frogs there (27 total?) and several non-frog<br/>
boxes too.  My personal favorite is the Horace Mann box - really cool<br/>
place.  There are several other letterboxers in the area too who I'm<br/>
sure will be happy to answer questions or help in any way they can.<br/>
The Mystery Hiker 2000 box has unfortunately been missing for quite a<br/>
while - I'm sorry you spent time looking for it when you could have<br/>
been finding some of the other boxes that are there.  Here's<br/>
something that might help: When you plan your next letterboxing trip,<br/>
come to this list and use the search box to see if there are any<br/>
messages about the boxes you intend to look for.  That should help<br/>
you see if anyone else has had a problem with those boxes, how<br/>
recently they may have been found, etc.  You can also post a message<br/>
and ask for reports about the boxes you intend to hunt.  Hopefully<br/>
that will minimize the frustration.  Glad to have you in the hobby -<br/>
have fun with it!<br/>
<br/>
Bigguy<br/>
<br/>
PS. When you run out of boxes in Yellow Springs, come on down to<br/>
Chillicothe and Jackson - we have several here too!<br/>
<br/>
PPS. Duh!  I did everything but answer your question.  An exchange<br/>
occurs when you meet another letterboxer in person and exchange<br/>
personal stamps with them.  You may see my personal stamp image in<br/>
many letterbox logbooks but the only way you'll get it in your<br/>
personal log is to meet me in person.  Hope this helps!<br/>

I don't know why these aren't coming up as hyper links -- but you get <br/>
the idea.  Actually at the top of the page click on Groups Home and <br/>
in the Join a Group search field type Letterboxing - there are a <br/>
number of groups with other more specific direction.<br/>

Just don't let letterboxing get in the way of your studies %^)<br/>

Oh, and if you get REAL  creative ... you might be able to snag a box or two in between classes  ONLY KIDDING!!! (But I know you'll want to!)  Blessings, MayEve<br/>

Hello everyone, my friend and I just recently learned about <br/>
letterboxing the other day, and we found our first letterbox <br/>
yesterday at Fort Steilacoom, WA. Its fun! it makes our walking more <br/>
fun not boring. We stopped at a store on the way home and grabbed <br/>
some stamps.<br/>
We live in Northwest Washington State.<br/>
Looking forward to getting to know ya'll!<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>

Hi,<br/>
After almost cutting my thumb off the other day trying to carve a stamp let <br/>
me ask you, what kind of tools do you use to carve with.  I have an exacto <br/>
knife and a blade knife but I haven't been able to find one of those little <br/>
scoop things.  Any suggestions on easier carving?<br/>

<br/>
Try a Speedball. Its technically a "linoleum cutter" but works <br/>
wonderfully with stamp materials and seems relatively safe. <br/>
<br/>
You may want to browse the links section of this list for more <br/>
carving ideas. And if you happen to have a stamp shop nearby, thats a <br/>
good place for tips too.<br/>
<br/>
-Steve and Heidi in CT<br/>
<br/>
PS -- I seem to remember the speedball cutters being about $12 for <br/>
the set. You may also find a "how-to" set that includes some pink <br/>
stuff for about $20. <br/>
&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; After almost cutting my thumb off the other day trying to carve a <br/>
stamp let <br/>
&gt; me ask you, what kind of tools do you use to carve with.  I have an <br/>
exacto <br/>
&gt; knife and a blade knife but I haven't been able to find one of <br/>
those little <br/>
&gt; scoop things.  Any suggestions on easier carving?<br/>

I've read about events that are posted on one of the LB websites and <br/>
people come from all over to get together with fellow <br/>

<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing!  You asked about letterboxes on Bois Blanc Island.  As far as I aware there are no boxes there.  I have always thought this would be an awesome place for a letterbox though -- great history and terrain and I like the remote factor, not to mention having to take the ferry to get there -- not just a drive up the highway to the letterbox.  It would certainly be a great place to take people for a letterbox hunt.  Perhaps you could leave one behind when you are there?<br/>
<br/>
I see you've already joined the Newboxers list, but you may also be interested in the Great Lakes list.  Even though you live in Reno, it sounds like you get to MI once in a while and there are several folks there who have found the Mackinac Island boxes and may be able to give some input for you:<br/>

When I first started letterboxing, there were about two boxes in my <br/>
area, too.  I was told to plant, plant, plant, and they will come.  I <br/>
did, and they did!  Miraculous.  My advice is to just get started and <br/>
hide your first box.  You can always edit the clues if you find you've <br/>
made a boo-boo.  My biggest mistake was planting boxes in February and <br/>
March when there wasn't any undergrowth.  What made sense then, made <br/>
absolutely NO sense when the plants grew so thick.  Keep that in mind!  <br/>
I had to replace one of my own boxes that I even had a hard time <br/>
finding.  keep it simple, keep looking for other boxes or reading other <br/>
clues, and you'll find your own style.<br/>

<br/>
Okay, so I visited this website and now I'm really confused!! :^) I <br/>
didn't realize there was SO much to learn! I live in central Florida, <br/>
are there any groups around here? We have yet to "go hunting", I am <br/>
one to research things first. I guess we should probably just go for <br/>
it and get our feet wet. Then I'm sure we'll have a lot more <br/>
questions!<br/>
Thanks for the advice, this seems like a great group!<br/>

I have yet to figure out what it is that I find so addictive--- finding them? planting them? carving stamps? looking at the logs? I really can't pinpoint it, but I do know that I cannot stop. Must find a letterboxers annoymous....<br/>

time we got to our second letter box it was pouring rain.   We ran <br/>
around a fabulous old cemetary. Unraveling the sad story of William <br/>
Irving and Jane Maria Johnson murder/suicide.   <br/>
<br/>
Dripping wet, laughing, following clues it was more fun than I've had <br/>
in years.   What a wonderful slice of joy, in something so simple.<br/>
<br/>
We had so much fun..<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow.. I created a trail name and I'm off to gather a little kit, <br/>
make a stamp and start exploring.  I can't wait to do it with Dancing <br/>
Star again!<br/>

  A warm WELCOME to you!  And yes, it IS tons of fun!!  If you haven't already done so, you might want to check out the Yahoo Group: Newboxers.  It's a great place for Letterboxers just stating out as well as the Oldie-But-Goodies.  You'll find alot of info there, and it's the perfect forum for asking all those "Newbie questions".  Hope to see you around, MayEve<br/>
