for sunny warm weather!<br/>
<br/>
We hiked to the top of one of the mountains at North Lake today.  The<br/>
trail was very good. There was ice in places but over 90% of the trail<br/>
was highly walkable. We had only hiking boots. Some places we had to hang<br/>
on to trees to make it over the slippery ice but that was only in a few<br/>
short places. Most of the snow was packed down to a few inches and easy<br/>
to walk on. The top at North Point was clear and so were the views. The<br/>
place where the letterbox was placed was covered with thick hard snow.<br/>
Will have to wait until Spring to get to it.<br/>
<br/>
On another front: handed in the letterbox book for approval, will find<br/>
out tomorrow if the director of the library says its ok to do. This is<br/>
the hollowed out Torts book I've been talking about.<br/>
