                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi! I seem to remember some PLB for those who can't letterbox due to illness or injury. Does anyone know anything about this and who to contact??  Or am I just imagining this? <br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask is that my 11 yo son is going to be undergoing surgery in September and I think it would be nice to get him on the list for this box. I think I remember that it had activities for those that are homebound which he will probably be for a few weeks. :( <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has info on this...I would appreciate it! Thanks much!<br/>
<br/>
Peppermint Patti :)<br/>
