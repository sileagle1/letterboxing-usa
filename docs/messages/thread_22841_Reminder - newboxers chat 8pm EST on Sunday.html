newbies, please note: there is a chat every Sunday night at 8p EST.<br/>
<br/>
I found the info on the homepage for the newboxers, which is where you<br/>
need to begin from to reach the chat room. <br/>
<br/>
The URL is: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
After you join, look at the menu to the left of your screen, and then<br/>
just click on CHAT.<br/>
<br/>
I just tried it to make sure there wouldn't be any hang-ups when I<br/>
wanted to get in for real.  Glad I did, because I found out I needed<br/>
JAVA enabled.  Now my settings are updated and I'm ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I can't remember if new members have to be approved, so the<br/>
sooner you join, the better your chance of getting to the chat tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it's easier to just ask a question and get an answer than it<br/>
is to post and have to wait or worry about the message with your<br/>
question being saved in the archives forever. There are no chat room<br/>
logs that will save your questions for the entire world to see later.<br/>
(grin -- hope that helps entice some of you)<br/>
<br/>
Also  its double cookie night, May Ev and I are both bringing cookies<br/>
tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
