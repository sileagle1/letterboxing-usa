This is the second box in Arizona and somewhat more accessible than the<br/>
first one.  It was placed on 01.01.00.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. We should color in the AZ on the map ;)<br/>

I wanted to let you know that I've successfully located both of your <br/>
Arizona letterboxes, and both are doing well.  The South Mountain one <br/>
had about 7-8 entries, and the Flatiron one had 2 entries including <br/>
mine.  Flatiron was one heck of a brutal hike, but worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the cool letterboxes.<br/>

that the So Mtn box had been found at least once but we are totally<br/>
psyched to hear that both boxes have multiple "hits".  Thanks for the<br/>
message this sort of feedback is really motivating.  We are displaced<br/>
Arizonans and are really looking forward to our next visit home so we can<br/>
place more boxes or, even better, hunt someone elses.   <br/>
