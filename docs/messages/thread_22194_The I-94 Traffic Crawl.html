                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, LBers.  I'm coordinating a series of new boxes in the Great Lakes<br/>
(as well as ND and MT) called "The I-94 Traffic Crawl".  Many of us<br/>
have spent way too many hours bored or frustrated on this freeway and<br/>
desperately long for diversion.  Is there a better diversion than<br/>
letterboxing?  NO!<br/>
<br/>
So we're looking for people to contribute.  Interested?  Let me know<br/>
your location and idea off-list and we'll run with it.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I've told the Great Lakes Region:<br/>
<br/>
First, the facts:<br/>
Number of Miles- 1614<br/>
* Montana- 249 miles<br/>
* North Dakota- 353 miles<br/>
* Minnesota- 260 miles<br/>
* Wisconsin- 351 miles<br/>
* Illinois- 81 miles<br/>
* Indiana- 45 miles<br/>
<br/>
Major Cities -<br/>
* WEST END: Billings, MT _____<br/>
* Bismark, ND _____<br/>
* Fargo, ND _____<br/>
* Twin Cities, MN _____<br/>
* Madison, WI _____<br/>
* Milwaukee, WI _____<br/>
* Chicago, IL _____<br/>
* Gary, IN  _____<br/>
* Kalamazoo, MI _____<br/>
* Detroit, MI _____<br/>
* EAST END: Port Huron, MI<br/>
<br/>
Let's call the thing "The I-94 Traffic Crawl" and prefix the boxes<br/>
accordingly (e.g. "The I-94 Traffic Crawl: Gary, IN". THEME: Just<br/>
play off the word "crawl" and think "traffic" - we've all been there,<br/>
right? Try and tie it in to your location somehow. Keep things a<br/>
mile or two off the freeway and send us somewhere interesting. We<br/>
need stimulation after staring at brake lights. (That part makes no<br/>
sense for Montana, but oh well...)<br/>
<br/>
Submit ideas and locations to me off-list and I'll make sure we avoid<br/>
duplicates.<br/>
<br/>
Let's also try to avoid the Chicago Oases since a few people are<br/>
already headed in that direction. Get us off the freeway!<br/>
<br/>
It would be great to have all the major cities represented as well as<br/>
the start and end points of the freeway. <br/>
<br/>
Even if someone in your area is already signed up, it doesn't hurt to<br/>
have more than one. Many of us crawl along this route often.<br/>
<br/>
This should be interesting and make our driving fun. I'm starting to<br/>
look forward to my next MI or Minneapolis trip. When you travel this<br/>
route, think about adding a box at a rest stop.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to your emails and ideas,<br/>
M Clan<br/>
