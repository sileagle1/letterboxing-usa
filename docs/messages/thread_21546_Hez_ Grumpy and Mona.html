Today Grumpy and I found number 500!!  We had to do the "Woo Hoo" <br/>
dance without Mona because the park we went to wasn't dog friendly, <br/>
but she danced in true doggie style when we got home and told her.<br/>
Thank you Sunshine and Swamp Yankee for introducing us to such a fun <br/>
hobby and forcing us to choose between biking and letterboxing all <br/>
summer-ain't fair I say. Thanks for letting us tag along on occasion, <br/>
and Sunshine you were right, I can't stop at 500-I need to get to <br/>
1,000!<br/>
Now if more of you would plant along the bike trails we would be in <br/>
heaven and Grumpy might even smile.<br/>
Thanks to everyone who plants, you've shown us some wonderful places <br/>
we didn't know existed and when we couldn't bike we had another way <br/>
to get some exercise.  Thank you one and all.<br/>
