<br/>
I have one two box series on a handicap accessible trail.  The boxes are well hidden, but in locations right next to the trail.  If you were to go to Friend's Landing (WA) she could follow the clues and work out where they are, and you could get the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Found another handicap trail, plan on installing boxes on it 'soon'.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there are not too many handicap trails available.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, enjoy!<br/>

We're planning a box just like this at a nearby<br/>
reservation in Western Mass. Unfortunately, finding<br/>
hiding places off trails that are accessible to<br/>
wheelchairs is not as easy as finding accessible<br/>
trails in general. But we're going to give it our best<br/>
try. <br/>

  &gt;about hiding our letterboxes where they would be accessible to the<br/>
  &gt;handicapped. They could still be well hidden from prying eyes but the<br/>
  trip<br/>
  &gt;to their location would be via routes on which some of the handicapped<br/>
  &gt;could<br/>
  &gt;travel.<br/>
  &gt;My wife is an avid scrap booker and this will go great with her hobby and<br/>
  &gt;our love of camping.<br/>
  &gt;Have a good week,<br/>
  &gt;Uncle Clay<br/>
