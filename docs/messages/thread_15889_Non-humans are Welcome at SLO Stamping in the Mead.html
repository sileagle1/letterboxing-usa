1. They are on leash<br/>
2. There is a human on the other end of the leash<br/>
3. That human picks up the waste the non-human leaves on the ground<br/>
4. The humans and non-humans play well together.<br/>
<br/>
We will be having folk of all ages there and welcome to all. <br/>
Letterbox-sniffing hounds seems like an unfair advantage to some but <br/>
hey! there are no rules. Okay, I am a badger by inclination; <br/>
dachshunds and I do not agree but I am willing to play nice if they <br/>
do, too.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone needing recommendations for camping or other lodging locally <br/>
for that, please write me offlist.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there, October 4th, San Luis Obispo, CA,<br/>
