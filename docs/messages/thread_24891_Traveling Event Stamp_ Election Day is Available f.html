<br/>
'The traveling event stamp ELECTION DAY by Trail Rider made its debut at <br/>
the Birds of a Feather event in Kirkland, IL, on June 21. The result of <br/>
the vote was a narrow victory for John McCain.<br/>
<br/>
This stamp is now available to travel to other letterboxing events <br/>
leading up to the presidential election in November. Contact Trail Rider <br/>
through Atlasquest if interested.'<br/>
<br/>
And I must add, it is a very nice stamp!<br/>
