rocks?<br/>

<br/>
We created a "rock" for our original Shawnee Trail letterbox in a small park<br/>
in downtown Dallas - it gave many folks a chuckle when they finally spotted<br/>
it! It was our first try &amp; not terribly authentic, but did the trick!<br/>
There are several possibilities to use: sculptamold, regular concrete and<br/>
flexall are three that are easy to find. You simply shape the stuff over a<br/>
saran-wrapped container.<br/>
We added pebbles &amp; twigs to the surface before it hardened.<br/>
I'd suggest a visit to your local hardware store, because the look on the<br/>
helpful handymen is priceless when you explain what you want!<br/>
If you want specifics, I'll gladly tell you more off-list.<br/>

NOTE: Ours ended up weighing a lot, because we got carried away - think<br/>
SMALL! <br/>
