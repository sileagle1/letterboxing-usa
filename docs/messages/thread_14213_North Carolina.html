<br/>
  Found early in the day today.  A lot of cobwebs on this trail.  <br/>
My 'lucky number' was 9. I was looking at the tree and moved slightly <br/>
to the right.  I felt something brush my ear/hat.  It was a very <br/>
large spider with something in it's mouth.  Yuck...luck abound; I did <br/>
not destroy or even upset the huge web spanning the path. I do <br/>
dislike these critters. Applause and clap for me as I boldly went <br/>
under it and onto the box!<br/>
<br/>
  BTW The letterbox was found and in good shape with a HH(4) on it's <br/>
side!!<br/>

<br/>
Sunning on a beach, drinking Mai Tais, and admiring hula dancers was bringing me well on the road to recovery. Although, I will admit, a Mai Tai can in no way compare to the sharing of a bottle of Tequila with Der Mad Stamper. As I was trying to forget this trying individual, I decided it was time to sober up and head back to the main land. <br/>
<br/>
Now, about this time, as luck would have it, I received an invitation from the Blue Ridge Rollergirls. Seems there was an expo coming up in June and they would love to have me attend. Now I ask you, who in their right mind would refuse an invitation from the Wham Bam Thank You Ma'ams and the Candy Apple Razorblades? A chance to watch these ladies in action put me in gear, and saying aloha to the Aloha State I headed off to North Carolina just as quick as my bag could be packed. Speaking of ladies, that dame MountainScorpia is from North Carolina. I would have invited her along, but was afraid she would bring a dog. I have heard tales about what her dog can do.<br/>
<br/>
The Rollergirls kept me busy, but I did manage to sneak away for a hike. The North Carolina Arboretum is a public garden that includes a Bonsai exhibit, pretty cool stuff. All of the trails are short, easily handled in a day. My favorite was the Carolina Mountain Trail. But, I did not come here to talk about Tequila, Rollergirls, or Bonsai; I came here to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
There are around 1,500 letterboxes in this state, but only 50 mysteries. Does the average North Carolinian know what a mystery is? I think not. Boxes for the most part are being well covered and sturdy containers are being used. The hand carved stamps outnumber the store bought. While there are some beautiful hikes out there, drive-bys are on the increase. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great tales of wanderings - I'm jealous. However, I do agree that the increase in drivebys is rather disconcerting. I do miss the great hikes, to great places, for incredible stamps...seems to be waning. Were it only that I could find a carving master from whom to learn...<br/>
