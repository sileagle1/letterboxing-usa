                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, since it rained real hard yesterday and it is supposed to snow tonight we ventured out this afternoon to do some boxing,the temperature was just right for us,we don't like the real cold.I could have kicked myself for forgeting MERROW PARK clues when doing the three wizards now we got to go back another time to do that one,good reason to take another walk.also did Grist in the mist,Just for kicks then skipped over and did One by land/One by sea.All were in great shape and nicely done, great carvings.As far as the purple heart,I can see where some people might get offended if they had a loved one hurt or killed in the line of duty but i'm sure this was not thought up to intentionally insult anyone.We are all proud of our fighting men and women and i'm sure that this was made up just out of fun.This is a club for having fun and a chance to tell a few stories,it should not be taken so seriously.Lenny/Kathy the NeeDeeps.
