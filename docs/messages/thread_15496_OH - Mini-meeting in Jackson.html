meeting/exchange in Jackson today with Scoutdogs (and Coyote), <br/>
Franzsolo, and the legendary Wanda from R.I. They're all very nice <br/>
people and we were happy to finally put faces with the stamps we've <br/>
seen so often. In addition to exchanging personal stamps, we shared <br/>
four hitchhikers between us and a traveler or two. Great way to <br/>
spend an hour on a pleasent holiday afternoon!<br/>
