 Well, that makes a lot of sense. It is such fun to open a letterbox and <br/>
find not only the stamp and log book, but a hitch hiker too. We've found two <br/>
in the last week or so at their points of origination. One is "The Boba <br/>
Hitchhiker" created by ClioMouse, for which we have already found a home in <br/>
a fairy tale setting. The other is "The Pineapple Traveller" conceived by <br/>
the South Hill Hendersons. We're talking now about a good place for its <br/>
relocation.<br/>

The same goes for travel bugs in caches; they draw people out to find. Knowing that a cache has a bug has been a deciding factor in which to seek.

And although I have sought geocaches for a bug, I have to tell you that most of the time the bug has been taken by another and not announced or posted, and no bug left in its place. (This is not playing according to rules that are clearly an understood part of the geocaching game. This is very frustrating.)  I was thinking not knowing and being surprised is better than feeling ripped-off.  But the truth is, we personally are far more likely to seek a cache if we know it has a particular bug in it.  <br/>

I'd most likely do so for a HH in a letterbox, too. But that's not the way most seem to want to play the letterboxing game.<br/>

If the HH is _yours_, you should have the right to decide if its drop off location is announced or not, IMNSHO.  How does that hurt anyone?  Is the creator of the host box going to whine about someone visiting their box _only_ to get a HH? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
You could end up getting someone's panties in a bunch if you (or a recent finder) announced that your hiker was at their box. So to avoid that issue, you might want to ask the owner of the host box if they'd mind you posting that your HH is in their box.  <br/>
<br/>
This that could trigger a very long debate that most people just don't want to hear. <br/>
<br/>
It might not be worth the effort.<br/>

  I see the surprise aspect of this but I also see that<br/>
  if a hitchhiker of mine were placed in a remote<br/>
  letterbox it could be a year (or more) before anyone<br/>
  goes out to find the LB and it's possible that that<br/>
  LBer might decide to leave the HH in the box. If it<br/>
  were announced that there was a HH in the box perhaps<br/>
  more LBers would be spurred on to find the box and<br/>

if you (or a recent finder) announced that your hiker<br/>
was at their box. So to avoid that issue, you might<br/>
want to ask the owner of the host box if they'd mind<br/>
you posting that your HH is in their box.  <br/>
<br/>
This that could trigger a very long debate that most<br/>
people just don't want to hear. <br/>
<br/>
It might not be worth the effort.<br/>

  I see the surprise aspect of this but I also see<br/>
that<br/>
  if a hitchhiker of mine were placed in a remote<br/>
  letterbox it could be a year (or more) before anyone<br/>
  goes out to find the LB and it's possible that that<br/>
  LBer might decide to leave the HH in the box. If it<br/>
  were announced that there was a HH in the box<br/>
perhaps<br/>
  more LBers would be spurred on to find the box and<br/>
  move the HH along.<br/>

&gt; If the HH is _yours_, you should have the right to decide if its drop <br/>

&gt; Is the creator of the host box going to whine about someone visiting <br/>
&gt; their box _only_ to get a HH?<br/>
<br/>
Probably no whining. Some HHs do this already. Just include it in the <br/>
HH's notes, along with any other instructions you feel are important. <br/>
(For example, I don't want the dropoff locations on my HHs advertised, <br/>
but I did include a note that they could travel by exchange or other <br/>
methods in addition to the traditional pick-up-drop-off method.)<br/>
