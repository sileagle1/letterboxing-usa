I don't have Firefox, but those ads popped up on Internet Explorer, <br/>
too... However, one with IE (and I thought any other browser) can go to:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/join<br/>
<br/>
Put in your Yahoo ID, if requested, and at the bottom of the box, <br/>
change your settings to "Traditional", from the "Fully Featured New &amp; <br/>
Improved!" setting, which is all the advertisement banners.<br/>

I appreciate the heads up since I use Firefox exclusively since 2003 thanks to the maestro de Maine and wasn't aware of this cool little extension!<br/>
