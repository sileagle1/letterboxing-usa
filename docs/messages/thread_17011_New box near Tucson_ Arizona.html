<br/>
Tanque Verde Falls Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: November 26, 2003<br/>
State:  Arizona<br/>
County:   Pima<br/>
Nearest city:  Tucson<br/>
Difficulty:   Walk  moderate.  Clues  easy<br/>
<br/>
The box is near Tanque Verde Falls in the Coronado National (Palo<br/>
Verde Tree!) Forest a little northeast of Tucson.  Take Grant or<br/>
Wilmot Roads to Tanque Verde Road.  Take Tanque Verde Road east to the<br/>
end of the pavement.  From the start of the dirt road go another 0.8<br/>
miles to the trailhead parking.<br/>
<br/>
Walk across the road to the trailhead and down the trail.  You will<br/>
pass the yellow warning signs.  You will then make a very sharp right<br/>
turn.  You will then cross over a short metal culvert pipe.  You will<br/>
then come to a very sharp left turn with a slender Saguaro Cactus<br/>
without arms on the right side of the turn and a small Barrel Cactus<br/>
on the left side.  Face south and go off trail at about 120 degrees<br/>
for about 27 paces to a moderate size Mesquite Tree with a Barrel<br/>
Cactus under its south side.  Continue straight ahead for about 25<br/>
paces to a moderate size Palo Verde Tree just beyond a small rock<br/>
ledge and with a dead Saguaro leaning against the tree.  The box is<br/>
under the north side of the tree under some rocks, branches and twigs.<br/>
  Be alert for snakes and scorpions.  Enjoy the view of Tanque Verde<br/>
Wash.  If you have time continue on the main trail to Tanque Verde<br/>
Canyon, and then cross the canyon to a trail that will go up canyon to<br/>
a view of the falls. <br/>
