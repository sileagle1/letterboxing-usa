Before you convince yourself that you can't carve your own stamp, check out <br/>
Ryan's tutorial:<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/Carving<br/>
<br/>
It's really quite easy to make a simple stamp; an eraser and X-acto knife <br/>
from Wal-Mart are all you need (along with a design). I think the only <br/>
people who believe it's hard are the ones who haven't tried to make one! <br/>
Just don't choose a complicated design for your first stamp -- and practice <br/>
on some simple designs first before you move on to more intricate stamps.<br/>

Completely true!  I thought stamp carving would be excruciatingly hard.  I mean, look at them!  They're gorgeous!  Of course they took a million years and Matisse reincarnated to do.<br/>
<br/>
Not so!  I made a trip to Michael's one day, and came back with:<br/>
<br/>
 two exacto knives<br/>
<br/>
 a five-dollar wood carving kit<br/>
<br/>
and several erasers (all different kinds, just to see what worked best) <br/>
<br/>
 My husband and I spent a very happy evening carving our stamps on the patio.  It really is easy!  The only trick is to remember to do mirror writing on the stamp.  I can't tell you how many new swear words I've invented after my husband casually points out that I'm "doing it again."  *grrr*!<br/>
<br/>
And, if it makes you feel better, I would always prefer to find a hand carved stamp in a box.  The simplest handmade stamp I think is always better than the most intricate machine made one.  I doubt I'm alone on that sentiment, too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you give it a try- it really is fun and relaxing (except my chiropractor can always tell when I've been working on a stamp.  *grin*)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with that.  I like going to a box and finding a one-of-a-kind treasure.<br/>
 I took my wife out for her first day of boxing and one of the boxes we went to<br/>
had a tiny store bought stamp that was made kids.  This box required a bit of a<br/>
hike up a rocky riverbed.  She was getting pretty burned out from slipping over<br/>
the rocks.  She told me that if that had been the first box she had ever found<br/>
after all that effort, I would have never been able to get her to a letterbox again.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, we had found several hand carved ones earlier in the day...  : )<br/>
<br/>
And it is really quite simple to make a hand-carved stamp.  I for one, don't<br/>
expect perfection from the stamps I find and I know that (almost) everone else<br/>
doesn't expect that either.  I enjoy the stamps for unique creative effort that<br/>
was put into them.<br/>

Lizardbutt's stamps look like something from the cubism period. He is <br/>
only 6 and last night he carved a new stamp that is a beyblade. <br/>

Try writing the word on a piece of paper, then put the stamp on top <br/>
of the word, then turn stamp and paper over, then rub paper with your <br/>
finger or pencil eraser. This may be a simple way to do it , but it <br/>
works. <br/>

I agree with Doug! I hardly have a creative bone in my body, but I <br/>
thought I'd give it a try anyway. I really wanted my own, personal <br/>
stamp, and didn't think a store bought would do the job that I <br/>
wanted. I wanted it to be "me". :)<br/>
So I got some so that pink speedball carving stuff, and a handle and <br/>
some tips. Then I made my design, transfered it, and started carving <br/>
away. I had a blast! I love carving! Hopefully, I get a little better <br/>
at it though. I've found that the crumbley carving stuff is easier to <br/>
carve than the pink stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and happy carving!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently came across a kit at my local Michael's that included the <br/>
pink stuff, a carving handle, two nibs, some tracing paper, and a <br/>
little booklet.  The carving tool is perfect- one nib is a sharp <br/>
narrow cutter, and the other a broad, flat cut.  outlining, shading, <br/>
surfacing, and lettering are all pretty easy with just these two <br/>
nibs.  You can get more pink stuff and a wider assortment of nibs at <br/>
stampeaze.com.  I've already run out of the stuff to carve into, the <br/>
pink stuff, so I'm waiting on an order of pz cut as we speak.  As far <br/>
as xactos and such are concerned, I had issues with undercutting and <br/>
getting even lines... the nice thing about the V shaped nib is that <br/>
you can cut shallow for a fine narrow line, deep for a wide one, or <br/>
go from shallow to deep for a line that gets wider, and vice versa.  <br/>
Anyway, I recommend the kit.  Good luck and have fun carving!<br/>
