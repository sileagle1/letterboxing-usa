<br/>
First and foremost, please remember that an animals sense of smell is up to 20 times greater than our own and that the simple fact that you touched the box, you've covered it in the most disgusting of scents, human scents. As one article puts it, to animals we stink!  Another indicates the usage of ammonia to deter fox bats for example. <br/>
<br/>
There's a ton of reports on the web about scents and such, but the basis seems to be that if you use unscented items, then all's well.  For the most part. Truth be known, as I said before, if you touch it, unless you are wearing rubber gloves, you've left a scent that the animals can find.  In the campsites we've put together, whenever an animal comes through it while we are away hunting, the only things that get gone through are the food items.  I've never seen or had an animal paw through a box of cleaning supplies or my dirty clothes bag, but, heaven forbid if you forget to put the food out of reach!<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at the sites below, if you want to.  They contain some information about scents and animals.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think Steve has a good point about human scent and that of our <br/>
chemicals.<br/>
I hadn't thought of it till he brought it up, but now, thinking <br/>
back, I remember the incredible preparations my husband and father-<br/>
in-law made to go trapping. Wash clothes in just water and then <br/>
store in pine needles for a month. Let the traps rust, boil them in <br/>
a walnut-shell dye, then wax (never oil!) them. Skip soap and <br/>
deodorant and alway wear plain cotton gloves (from the pine needle <br/>
storage)<br/>
On the other hand - if folks say the chemically cleaned boxes were <br/>
eaten, then they were. Period.<br/>
(The real question is WHY those idiot animals like the taste of <br/>
cleaners.)<br/>
So if one wants to experiment with cleaners in the woods, sure, go <br/>
ahead, but to be polite we should do it in the maintenance of our <br/>
OWN boxes only, and use water on found boxes.<br/>
Fair 'nuff?<br/>

  Can I post a reminder that baby wipes and most stamp cleaners <br/>
  are HIGHLY sented and attract animals.  Now it may be nice to <br/>
  clean someone's stamp for them, but it isn't so nice if the <br/>
  chipmunks and bears have dragged it off to have for lunch.  I <br/>
  hope nobody is using commercial cleaning products on my <br/>
  boxes.  I think it contributes to the MIA counts.<br/>
