Okay, can I step in for a second?  I'm hearing things that I see <br/>
happen so often in lists.  Please remember that the intention of how <br/>
things are written is not always how they are read.  I heard some <br/>
people asking about trying to reduce traffic to a spot they hid a box <br/>
in.  I heard others stating that sometimes making a clue challenging <br/>
works for that.  I heard others explaining that people like different <br/>
clues for different reasons and a wide variety of them is good.<br/>
<br/>
I did not hear anyone personally calling us stupid or lazy (just <br/>
using the words tongue-in-cheek).  I did not hear the least bit of <br/>
implication that someone who is disabled is less than us or should be <br/>
kept from clues.  I don't think anyone worth their salt would even <br/>
begin to think this.    <br/>
<br/>
I'm beginning to hear some hints of this thread and others turning <br/>
personal though.  What is seen on this list is healthy discussion, <br/>
and since so many of us participate, we often see strong disagreement <br/>
or misunderstandings--most often the latter.  Please remember that <br/>
our list has chosen a policy of light moderation and freedom of <br/>
expression, but that we agree not to attack personally.  Moderators <br/>
try hard to not force involvement in issues, but if letterboxers <br/>
begin showing they cannot give basic respect to others, they may have <br/>
to be more involved.  None of us want to do be forced to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that most often, flames die best on their own and they <br/>
usually come after people react strongly to a select few's opinions.  <br/>
When we become strongly involved that fuels the fire or it makes it <br/>
fester.  There has been some concern expressed recently though about <br/>
personal attacks on the list.  Please remember to not tear down <br/>
another letterboxer simply because what makes them enjoy the hobby is <br/>
different for you than it is for them--and I say this to people on <br/>
both sides of any issue.  Give due respect, your opinion may be <br/>
misunderstood next--we've all been there!<br/>
<br/>
Now get out and box!<br/>
