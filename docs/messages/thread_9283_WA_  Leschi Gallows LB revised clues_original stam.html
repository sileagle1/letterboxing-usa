Lakewood, Pierce County, WA today in a less squirrel-friendly <br/>
location.  Please replace the clues to this box with the revised <br/>
clues listed below:<br/>
<br/>
Leschi Gallows Letterbox<br/>
Orginially Placed:  1 November 2002<br/>
Replaced (original stamp) to a less squirrel friendly location:  21 <br/>
November 2002<br/>
<br/>
History:  Chief Leschi (Nisqually Indian tribe) was hanged on the <br/>
gallows at Fort Steilacoom on 19 February 1858, for the 'murder' of <br/>
Col A. Benton Moses in the presence of 300 witnesses.  It was argued <br/>
in court that first Chief Leschi did not `murder' Col Moses and <br/>
second that he died as a result of combat during the Indian Wars and <br/>
that his death was not `murder' but rather attributable to warfare <br/>
and that the alleged perpetrator should not have been tried in a <br/>
civilian court but instead in a military court.  <br/>
     Prior to that event, Chief Leschi had been quite friendly with <br/>
the American settlers in the region.  Although his outlook changed <br/>
when he reluctantly signed the Medicine Creek Treaty of 1854 forcing <br/>
the Nisqually tribe to relocate its entire people to a two square <br/>
mile reservation that didn't have access to the Nisqually Rivera <br/>
river along &amp; by which their tribe had resided and fished for many <br/>
generations.  He felt totally shortchanged by the lopsided outcome <br/>
of the treaty and ultimately led approximately 300 troops against <br/>
the United States during the Indian Wars of 1855 and 1856.  He was <br/>
captured as a result of his nephew, Sluggia, turning him in for a <br/>
reward.  Sluggia was later killed by one of Leschi's Lieutenants.  <br/>
Chief Leschi's first trial resulted in a hung jury.  The second <br/>
trial resulted in a guilty verdict with his hanging occurring in <br/>
February 1858.  To this day, there exists much speculation that <br/>
Chief Leschi was an innocent man.  His hangman, Charles Grainger, <br/>
commented "He did not seem to be the least bit excited at all -- <br/>
nothing of the kind, and that is more than I could say for myself. <br/>
In fact Leschi seemed to be the coolest of any on the scaffold. He <br/>
was in good flesh and had a firm step and mounted the scaffold <br/>
without assistance, and as well as I did myself. I felt then I was <br/>
hanging an innocent man, and I believe it yet."  <br/>

Clues:  Locate the `ghostly' decrepit and old haunted building high <br/>
atop the hill North of Waughop Lake.  From the concrete cube not far <br/>
from the old building, head North then West along a cottonwood lined <br/>
gravel road to the water towers atop the ridge.  From the junction <br/>
of the gravel trail and a dirt road that leads to the Eastern-most <br/>
tower, turn, face East for a great view of Waughop Lake and Mt <br/>
Rainier (on a clear day)!  Then, face North and take 6 paces to the <br/>
North to a small trail.  Follow the trail toward the East at first, <br/>
pass a fallen tree that crosses the trail.  From this tree, 68 paces <br/>
(1 pace=2 steps) along the trail as it curves around back toward the <br/>
water tower.  Look for a 4' tall burnt stump.  Two fruit trees to <br/>
the North is where the gallows might have stood oh so long ago.  <br/>
Look within and under some bark for the Leschi Gallows letterbox.  <br/>
When you rehide this letterbox, be careful not to put it in a spot <br/>
where it will 'drop' into the belly of the tree.<br/>
