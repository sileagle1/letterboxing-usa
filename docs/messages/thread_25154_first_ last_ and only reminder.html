Gee, that sounds ominous, and even better, in staying<br/>
in character, pretentious, but the actual reminder is<br/>
that any tokens, etc., that allow free questions, hints,<br/>

I'm not underground -- the rest of the world is overground.  I<br/>
was here first, and that's the way I look at it ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But, to answer your question, I've retired, but those who are<br/>

not be disappointed going forward.  We'll see, I guess.<br/>

That said, this thread is unrelated to all that.  I just don't want<br/>
someone e-mailing me five years from now regarding some box I've<br/>
never heard of, and it turns out to be mine :)  I've actually had<br/>
that happen once, and its pretty spooky, but it least it tells me<br/>
my ideas on simulated treasure hunting have been internalized ...<br/>

Thank you for all you have done to get this addiction off the ground.  I appreciate the hobby, and appreciate all your work in the early days.  <br/>
<br/>
I give you good wishes for your future.<br/>
