                    <div class="plaintext-content">I paid a visit to "Dancing at Bougival" in Lacey WA.  First and <br/>
foremost, a wonderful box.  Stamp well done!  Poem, a stunning <br/>
tribute to the Head Nails one True Love , Happy Mommy.<br/>
<br/>
And what an interesting park.  I sort of fell off the clues so busy <br/>
looking at interesting trees growing in an interesting fashion.  I <br/>
had to wonder if one area of the park had some standing flood water <br/>
at one time.  Many trees that obviously grew out of nurse stumps, but <br/>
no stumps to be seen.  Just not something I have seen much in this <br/>
region.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway got back on course to the tune of many Spring-ing birds.<br/>
<br/>
The box is a gem and inside it was heavy with TWO Hitch hikers.  One <br/>
by Head Nail himself is a mini version of his Dancing at Bougival, so <br/>
it has hit the road so others may see this great stamp and read the <br/>
lovely poem.<br/>
<br/>
The other HH was "The Lost Hiker" HH by Eliza B the Modern Gypsy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks heaven for a sunshiny day.  The stamp is elaborate and <br/>
required some coloring at the handy lunch table.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to all.<br/>
