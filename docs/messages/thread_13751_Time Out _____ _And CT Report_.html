TOPIC that they have said in the past two or so days.... please <br/>
email it to us personally! We've been filtering through the <br/>
bickering and we hope it stops SOON!!!  <br/>
<br/>
On a better note, we did a little drive today through the greater... <br/>
umm... yeah, we can't talk about those on here!  Anyways, we got 3 <br/>
boxes out of a mysterious 6 box series. Could not get one due to <br/>
fisherman.... and had 2 of the 6 on a previous trip. Ummmm planting <br/>
a new and easy DRIVE UP in WATERFORD this week (possibly tomorrow). <br/>
Do yourself a favor and leave it for a rainy day!!! Its soooo nice <br/>
to have an easy box or 2 on these yucky weekends!<br/>
<br/>
Got a nice note regarding Avery Tract in Waterford with nothing but <br/>
praise! Hopefully a few nice warm days will get all of ya out <br/>
there !!!!<br/>

depending on if ya count in people years or dog years!) <br/>
