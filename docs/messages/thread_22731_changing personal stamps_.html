yearly. Last year it was a word stamp - liked it but<br/>
it's a bit too big. If I can't get the whole word<br/>
stamp in the logbook and it gets cut off it doesn't<br/>
make much sense. This year I have a new letterboxing<br/>
companion - my standard poodle boxing buddy. I carved<br/>
a poodle stamp and have been using it for 2005. Next<br/>
year maybe I'll carve a different poodle stamp or<br/>
maybe something that reflects what's going on in my<br/>
life in 2006.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many people change their personal stamp. I started with a very very <br/>
simple padlock carving. A couple of months later I carved a much more <br/>
intricate one of a fancier padlock. I still use the first one as it is <br/>
a lot smaller and easier to stamp into mini boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Some people use a bunch of different stamps. Such as Der Mad Stamper.  <br/>
Remember....no rules.  :)<br/>
