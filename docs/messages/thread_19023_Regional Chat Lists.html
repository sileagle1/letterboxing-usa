                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was recently asked how one finds out about letterboxing regional chat lists.  Diane and I just came back from a trip and are leaving for another tomorrow, so I apologise if this has been discussed and I haven't gotten to it on my list of e-mail yet!<br/>
<br/>
I know of the list for the Northeast:<br/>
<br/>
LBNE@yahoogroups.com<br/>
<br/>
and I understand there's a bunch more, like Connecticut.  The link on the homepage isn't working for her or me.  Can anyone pitch in with more ideas?  I thought to ask "What region are you from?", but then some folks enjoy holidaying at another particular area, also.  Besides, others may benefit from the discussion.<br/>

Yep, here's a fairly complete listing of letterboxing discussion groups, <br/>
including a directory of regional groups:<br/>

Let me know if there are any that I'm missing.<br/>
