                    <div class="plaintext-content">Beldin was lazily dreaming about his new location.  There was no sleep <br/>
for the weary wizard.  <br/>
	That incessant song keeps ringing in my ears.  "I crave rest!  <br/>
Do these silly treasure seekers not realize my ultimate plan?  Sleep, <br/>
rest, rejuvenation.  Let me be."  Beldin awoke with a start.<br/>
	The swirling green led Beldin farther downstream.  On the left, <br/>
he spied an elbow shaped tree, high off the ground.  "Too much like <br/>
that hanging tree," he thought.  He drifted farther along, to a place <br/>
where the trail is interrupted by a severed tree on both sides of the <br/>
path.  Standing between these detached limbs, he spied another "V" tree <br/>
at 140 degrees.  "There, there, high up on the hill, buried in that V-<br/>
tree under a rock, I will hide and sleep, perchance to dream."<br/>
	In the place between sleep and life, Beldin wandered.  His mind <br/>
recalled his journey thus far.  How interesting and joyous he was for <br/>
his new voyage.  "Another patch for these pants," he thought.  Charles <br/>
Caleb Colton said, "Much may be done in those little shreds and patches <br/>
of time which every day produces, and which most men throw away."  For <br/>
my treasure seekers a new journal to keep them content and now sleep.  <br/>
