Easy stroll through a beautiful state park.  I was shocked to reach to final<br/>
point in the clues and be able to see the letterbox from the trail.  It was<br/>
just sitting on top of a log.  The good news is that it was in perfect<br/>
condition.  We hid it behind and under the log when we were done.  We took<br/>
my parents and my niece.  It was their first letter box.  No one else had<br/>
stamped in it, so our group were the first three.  I don't know if family<br/>
counts, but we also stamped exchanges in our books.  I was very disappointed<br/>
to get home tonight and discover the new Turtle series in that area.  My<br/>
parents collect turtles and decided to use one when they created their<br/>
stamp.  I guess I will have to find a way to check my email while I am away<br/>
so I don't miss out on any great opportunities.  The new ones will have to<br/>
wait until next Christmas.<br/>
