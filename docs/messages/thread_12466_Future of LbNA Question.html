&gt; Hello Jay,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I've put  all of Chuck's and Irishtinker's letterboxes on the new web site.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Both are planting new boxes and I've been having the announce group put it <br/>
&gt; on the new list. However, I've also been having them send in an email to <br/>
&gt; the talk list showing the new box and at the bottom, I've been putting: <br/>
&gt; Note to Webmasters: This box has been added to the new website.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; The reason I've been doing this is that when I last looked, only 49 people <br/>
&gt; had signed up for the announce list compared to over the 1000 members on <br/>
&gt; the talk list.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Is it ok for me to have them do it that way or is this causing more <br/>
&gt; problems for you?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Thanks and take care,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Barbara<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Hi, Barb! No, that's just right. I hope everyone still "announces" on the <br/>
main list just like we used to. I love reading them all and hope I don't have <br/>
to read yet another mailing list to keep up. I did the same thing with our <br/>
newest letterboxes planted last week. An added bonus: people can announce <br/>
their new boxes and also give the website address for them, since it won't <br/>
take weeks for a box to get posted to the LbNA site.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking: I'm going to forward this both to the big group and the <br/>
webmasters as well.<br/>
<br/>

I had signed up for the announce-list--but I took myself off because everyone <br/>
is businly entering their boxes, so announcements for each and every one <br/>
showed up in my e-mail.  When the frenzy is over, I intend to sign up for the <br/>
announce-list again.  I would guess other people are doing the same.<br/>

I've been thinking about this, and there are different ways to do this<br/>
<br/>
a) have the announce list, and people manually announce on this list <br/>
(which I'll call the "discussion list") if they want to by hand (the way it <br/>
is now) -- pros: less clutter on this list and<br/>
more control, cons: more lists to monitor, more work for the poster<br/>
<br/>
b) have the announce go to this list -- pros: one list to monitor, replies <br/>
to interesting clues posted follow on the discussion list -- cons: possible<br/>
massive increase of list volume (the announce mail could be formatted with<br/>
"CLUE" in the subject for those who filter mail, tho would there be much <br/>
more list volume? there would not be (assuming clue rate remains the same<br/>
as it has), but the volume _was_ to high to begin with, and a) in theory <br/>
should bring it down)<br/>
<br/>
c) have the poster choose which list when creating the clue (presumably,<br/>
"run of the mill" clues would go to the announce list, while "cool" clues<br/>
could be posted to the discussion list ("run of the mill" and "cool"<br/>
in the eyes of the creator).<br/>
<br/>
With any of these methods, the poster would have the option, of course,<br/>
of not posting to any list.<br/>
<br/>
No guarantees that any (other than a, the status quo, would be implemented,<br/>
but I am interested in what people think.  If people care, I'll start a<br/>
poll).<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm a little confused.  I guess I thought the purpose of the lbox-<br/>
announce list associated with the new site was for announcing new <br/>
boxes.  If we are going to continue to do it on this list <br/>
instead/also, why even have that list?<br/>
<br/>
In the world as it was before last week, new boxes were posted to <br/>
this list for 2 reasons:  First so the webmasters could pick them up <br/>
and add them to the LbNA site, and secondly to let everyone else know <br/>
about the new box.  In the new world (once the transition has been <br/>
fully made), it is no longer necessary for webmasters to post clues <br/>
to the LbNA web site, and boxes can be announced on the new lbox-<br/>
announce list, thus negating the primary reasons for posting new <br/>
boxes to this list.<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is it should be one or the other.  Either we should <br/>
announce boxes on the new list exclusively, or if we choose to <br/>
continue to do it here, then don't even have the new list.<br/>
<br/>
Neither way is perfect.  As Randy pointed out, there are pros and <br/>
cons to both.  If it is left to each person to choose their <br/>
preference and some are announcing their boxes only to the new list, <br/>
and others are announcing only to the old list, you really have to <br/>
keep up with both lists to see everything.  And then there is the <br/>
possibility that some will announce both places, which would <br/>
definitely create an increase in message/mail volume for those <br/>
monitoring both lists.<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of like the situation with the separate HH list.  Some use <br/>
it to post HH info, others post HH info on this list.  Because there <br/>
is no consistent way of doing it, in order to see it all, you need to <br/>
follow both lists.  Granted it is not such an issue with HH, because <br/>
the volume is minute in comparison to the volume of new boxes, but <br/>
the concept is the same.<br/>
<br/>
As far as having to keep up with yet another list, if you are set up <br/>
for e-mail on both lists, there really isn't anything extra to do as <br/>
all of the messages land in your e-mail regardless of where they are <br/>
coming from.  Even if you are reading this list online, you can still <br/>
set up for e-mail on the new one (there really isn't a reason to read <br/>
the new list online since you cannot reply or begin new discussion <br/>
threads).  With the help of a couple of mail rules, you can send the <br/>
incoming e-mail messages off to a folder or even filter them by <br/>
state. <br/>

[JDW] If you send the SAME message to both lists (at the same time, i.e.<br/>
one message, "two" recipients), YahooGroups is smart enough to send only<br/>
one copy of the message to those who subscribe to both lists.<br/>

&gt; list, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and others are announcing only to the old list, you really have <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; keep up with both lists to see everything.  And then there is the <br/>
&gt; &gt; possibility that some will announce both places, which would <br/>
&gt; &gt; definitely create an increase in message/mail volume for those <br/>
&gt; &gt; monitoring both lists.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; [JDW] If you send the SAME message to both lists (at the same <br/>
time, <br/>
&gt; i.e.<br/>
&gt; &gt; one message, "two" recipients), YahooGroups is smart enough to <br/>
send <br/>
&gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; one copy of the message to those who subscribe to both lists.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; They would have to be titled exactly the same, and since the <br/>
message <br/>
&gt; coming from the lbox-announce list is auto-generated and the <br/>
message <br/>
&gt; to this list would be manually posted, I doubt that would be the <br/>
case.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; [JDW] Actually, there are a couple of list I'm on where it's worked <br/>
like<br/>
&gt; a charm for at least 6 months, so I can't imagine why it wouldn't <br/>
work<br/>
&gt; here.  Maybe someone who's on both lists can confirm? <br/>

It was my understanding from your first post that it would have to <br/>
be "one message with two recipients."  As the message coming from the <br/>
lbox-announce list would be an auto-generated message and the <br/>
letterbox-usa list message would be a manual post made by the <br/>
submitter, how could they be the same message?<br/>
<br/>
Unless of course, the new LbNA site was modified to auto-send <br/>
the "announce" message to both lists.  This would work, but what <br/>
would be the purpose of having two lists if all of the messages on <br/>
the lbox-announce list were being sent to this list anyway?<br/>
<br/>
If we want the new box announcements to still show up here on this <br/>
list, then perhaps the other list is not needed.<br/>

I guess some folk may just want announcements and not all the chit-chat? I<br/>
kind-of like the idea that announcements could go to both lists - you'd only<br/>
subscribe to the announcement list if you wanted only announcements. But I'd<br/>

there (currently replies to "announcements" results in the culprit being<br/>

That is an idea I hadn't considered...  that some may want ONLY the <br/>
new box announcements (I'm with Doublesaj there and like reading <br/>
things like how LizardButt got his name, etc.), but I'm sure others <br/>
would just as soon not have the chit-chat.  In that case I can see <br/>
the benefit of maintaining both lists.  And if the "announce to <br/>
group" option could be set to send both places, it would still be <br/>
auto-generated all around and would ensure no matter which list you <br/>
are reading, you would see the new box posts, without having to <br/>
monitor both lists.<br/>

&gt; I'm a little confused. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry if that is my fault :-) (I'll try to be clearer)<br/>
<br/>
The good thing about 2 lists is people can opt out of the chatter,<br/>
opt out of the mountain of clue posts, or mix and match.<br/>
<br/>
The bad things are two lists to check, no discussion of cool<br/>
clues (or the creator has to announce to 2 places), or fear on the<br/>
part of the creator that their clue is not reaching as large an <br/>
audience as is possible.<br/>
<br/>
Many comments can be made about all of this, probably too many.  I, for<br/>
one, personally enjoy announcing each of my clues with a different message<br/>
(and I will continue to use this list regardless of what happens in the end).<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I think the solution that covers most of the wall with one<br/>
bucket of paint is --<br/>
<br/>
When creating a clue, have two options ("post to announce list", "post to<br/>
discussion list"), one of which, both of which, or neither of which can <br/>
be selected by the creator.  On the "post to discussion list", a free <br/>
form text field and subject line would also be available which will become <br/>
part of the message (it would be a little mail client, not a big deal).<br/>
<br/>
Wes is busy so I'm not going to ask him to do more work, just my 2 cents.<br/>
<br/>
As for setting the reply to on the announce list posts to be the discussion<br/>
list, that is a good idea, but I'm not sure if yahoo's mail server will<br/>
go for it.  (I also don't think it is as good an idea as mine, but it is<br/>
trivial to implement).  If I have time, I will test this, or someone else <br/>
is free to (anyone with a normal mail client can try this test).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
