The weather forecast is for more warm spring sun, and we're happy to <br/>
report that we've got green. The maple leaves came in first and we <br/>
drank them up like famine survivors after the gray icy winter. The <br/>
trails are in great shape after a very busy Trails Day maintenance <br/>
schedule statewide, and they're dry and ready for us. Just some notes:<br/>
<br/>
We'll be camping at Rocky Neck State Park beginning Friday afternoon. <br/>
Directions: from I-95 in East Lyme CT, take exit 72 and follow the <br/>
longish connector to the end. Turn left on Rte. 156 and watch for the <br/>
park on your right. Check in at the gate and then drive down to the <br/>
campgrounds: we'll probably be at the farthest open area and <br/>
will "reserve" a bunch of sites close to the restrooms by putting <br/>
coolers and stuff on the picnic tables. Look for our unmistakably red <br/>
VW bus. We've visited the park several times in the last few weeks <br/>
and think it'll be a great place for the gathering. The rangers are <br/>
expecting us, and there haven't been too many campers this early in <br/>
the season. The campground has a Long Island Sound beach, incredible <br/>
wetlands, and some fun upland hiking. There is one known letterbox <br/>
there ("Resolution"), and we'll hide a special box just for the <br/>
weekend, a la Tom last year.<br/>
<br/>
Since it's Mother's Day weekend, we've got some good recommendations <br/>
for Sunday brunch. I think we had said we'd just hang out Friday <br/>
night as people trickle in. There is a nice blues club close by for <br/>
Friday or Saturday if you'd like, and there's also a terrific <br/>
children's museum (as well as Mystic Aquarium, Mystic Seaport, and 2 <br/>
casinos if you're in the mood).<br/>
<br/>
Please don't hesitate to write or call with any questions. Looking <br/>
forward to seeing you!<br/>
