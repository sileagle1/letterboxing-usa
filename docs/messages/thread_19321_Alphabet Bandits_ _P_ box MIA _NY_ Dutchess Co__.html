<br/>
Sorry for the triple cross - post...<br/>
<br/>
It's recently come to my attention that our "P" box may be MIA... I am fairly sure this is accurate, as the potential finder did describe the location and stuff that "was" covering the box.   I still don't have a car, so I am not sure when I'll be able to check and replace.  I will try to get it done within the next 10 days however.  <br/>
<br/>
The website has been updated and will be changed when the box is either found or replaced.  If in doubt please e-mail beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I will be going no-mail on all the box lists as of Friday 2 July and will not be returning to the lists until late August, so if you plan on getting any of our boxes and have questions, you'll have to e-mail me directly or through the website www.alphabetbandits.org  I will be checking my regular mail once a day ... ok.... well maybe twice, but no more than that I SWEAR!<br/>
<br/>
Have a great and boxious summer!<br/>
