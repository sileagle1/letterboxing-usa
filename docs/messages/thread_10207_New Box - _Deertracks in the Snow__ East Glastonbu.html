Blackledge Falls Park, East Glastonbury, Connecticut<br/>
Hiking distance to letterbox approximately 0.4 miles one way (15 mins), easy<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox was placed near a 30 foot waterfall in the Blackledge Falls<br/>
Park in East Glastonbury January 12, 2003.  The trail climbs (from a parking<br/>
area) the east slope of John-Tom Hill through woods and over small brooks.<br/>
It is a well marked trail, easy to navigate.<br/>
<br/>
The Trail<br/>
<br/>
Take Route 94 (Hebron Avenue) east from Glastonbury, past Route 83<br/>
(Manchester Road) and continue heading east.  Follow 3-4 miles up John-Tom<br/>
Hill past, at the top, Marlborough Road.  Continuing on 94 the road slopes<br/>
downward fairly steeply, and near the bottom, on the left hand side of the<br/>
road, a large wooden sign indicating Blackledge Falls.  On the right there<br/>
is a turn in where you can park.  This morning there was a lot of snow at<br/>
this turn in.<br/>
<br/>
Park the car anywhere in this parking area and proceed back to the main road<br/>
and cross it, walking towards the sign for Blackledge Falls.  Proceed to the<br/>
chain where the trail starts.  From this point the box is 0.4 miles.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the blue-white-blue blazes (some trees may have two of them  that<br/>
s still the trail).<br/>
<br/>
Just before the first bridge over a small brook there is a side path down to<br/>
a small dam on the Blackledge River.  The water falls over the top of this<br/>
dam, and in spring and summer this is a fine spot to catch small bass and<br/>
trout.<br/>
<br/>
As you proceed through the woods you will hike across two additional small<br/>
bridges over small brooks flowing to the river.<br/>
<br/>
Just as the trail turns away from the river and into the woods there appears<br/>
to be a fork.  The blue-white-blue blazes are indicated on the path to the<br/>
left (southerly), which is the course to follow.  About 75 feet later a<br/>
small blue sign in a tree indicates the direction to The Falls, which is<br/>
where youre going.<br/>
<br/>
The path follows a very pretty babbling brook up the hill to a point 0.35<br/>
miles from the start where another sign indicates a sharp left turn, over<br/>
the babbling brook, towards the falls.  Follow the sign and head up the path<br/>
where, shortly, you will see the falls from a lookout.  Enjoy the view <br/>
they are beautiful in all seasons.<br/>
<br/>
The Box<br/>
<br/>
As you proceed down the path to the bottom of the falls you will immediately<br/>
pass to the right of a large oak tree.  Between it and the next tree, on the<br/>
left about 20 feet,is a small group of large stones.  There you will find a<br/>
large fallen tree lying almost on a N-S line.  At the North end of the<br/>
fallen tree, nestled in the stones, is the box.<br/>
<br/>
Return as you came and enjoy the hike.<br/>
