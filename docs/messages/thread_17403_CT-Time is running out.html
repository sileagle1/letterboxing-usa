The Old Newgate Prison was one of our first series.<br/>
Great story, great views, and great stamps! To those<br/>
of you that haven't gotten them yet, this series is a<br/>
must have for your logbooks!<br/>

I am very sorry to hear that Old Newgate Prison letterboxes are <br/>
being retires.  That was a very fun series.  I remember hiking it <br/>
with Jonathan one beautiful fall afternoon.  We loved every second <br/>
of that hike.  When we got to the top of the mountain were it looks <br/>
over the entire countryside, we met up with some other letterboxers <br/>
who were looking for the other series on that same mountain.  We <br/>
informed them of your series and gave them our clues as we were <br/>
almost done with them.  When we finally found the last box, we <br/>
realized we had to be back at the car within 45 minutes.  It had <br/>
taken well over an hour to get to this point.  So we hiked hard back <br/>
to the car and made it back in less than a half hour.  I must say we <br/>
were prettay happy with ourselves!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I just thought a little story like that might make you change you <br/>
mind about removing such a wonderful series of letterboxes.  I hope <br/>
you have a wonderful New Year.  Hope to see you soon.  Safe <br/>
