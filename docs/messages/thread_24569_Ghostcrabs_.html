response.<br/>

The issue is that I went looking for a series of their boxes recently <br/>
and found that they have been all but destroyed (by critters it <br/>
appears, not humans).  I'm wondering if Ghostcrabs is still in a <br/>
position to maintain the boxes or if they should perhaps be archived.<br/>
