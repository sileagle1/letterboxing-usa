Just wanted to thank all of you (40plus 'boxers!!) who came to our Maine<br/>
Event Gathering on Saturday.  It was a great day--full of fun, food and<br/>
boxes... not to mention stamp exchanges galore!  We even had a cake with<br/>
LbNA logo icing!  So, thanks for the great day... maybe we can do this<br/>
again next year!...<br/>

We really enjoyed our stay at Thomas Point Beach Campground, as well.  We want to go camping up there again but hope to spend a week, rather than a day and a half, so we can get the local boxes.  There were some boxes we wanted and just couldn't do  because night was coming on, and we needed some of the day to spend with Dan's parents, too.  We drove back to their site at the campground to give them directions to the Baybridge Landing area because we knew his mother and father would love the birds.<br/>
<br/>
We were in the absolutely worst area of The Commons when we were caught in a long, steady downpour. <bleah>  That put a real "damper" on the rest of the day!!!  ;-)<br/>

Mary and Dan<br/>
