or vandalism, or being carted off by an animal, or ruined by negligence and <br/>
bad weather, etc. so I make my logbooks no longer than about 25 to 30 pages at <br/>
the most.  When a logbook is filled, I scan groups of the pages into the <br/>
computer and then print them out (in colour) and leave *those* pages in the box <br/>
with the new logbook.  That way I have the original logbook pages safely at home, <br/>
and yet folks who find the box can see the stamps &amp; comments of those who <br/>
came before them.  I make my own logbooks, so they're easy to dismantle to spread <br/>
out groups of pages together on the scanner.<br/>
