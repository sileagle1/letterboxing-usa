                    <html><body><p>Just a few more pieces of info for those coming to the gathering on Saturday.  I have included directions to the picnic area on the website.  Just a word of caution - the picnic area is not part of the campground!!  They are on opposite sides of the lake.  Access to the picnic area is free.  If you are not staying at the campground but want to repair there after dinner you will have to pay a $2or $3 fee to visit (or walk in or bum a ride with someone staying there).  </p>
<p>I will be setting up a table in the picnic area around 9 am.  The pavilion is covered, has several klunky picnic tables (you may prefer a lawn chair) and two fireplaces.  Fur and Ben of RIBNAG have agreed to keep the homefires burning for us.  Most people have indicated that they are arriving mid-morning and will be stopping by throughout the day.  </p>
<p>I will have clues to several boxes in the Charlestown area available.  I will not be able to make any more copies between now and then so if you plant a new box make sure you bring copies of clues or it will be a lonely box.  I am assuming that people will be stopping by throughout the day and brownbagging it for lunch at the picnic area.  Carol Stearns has a special stamp that you have to check at the pavilion to "find."  There will be one or more human travellers to find, also.  </p>
<p>Make sure that you either bring a stamp for the stamp carving competition or supplies to carve one there (I will have a few blank erasers available).  The Cock a Doodle Moo club has offered to handle the prizes for the event.  People will be able to vote on stamps throughout the day and prizes will be awarded in the late afternoon.  </p>
<p>I am assuming that people will start returning to the picnic area around 4 or so where we will have a few activities, dinner and lots of story and stamp exchanging.  There is no electricity or lights at the pavilion and the park is supposed to close at sunset.  Those who are interested in staying later are invited to come to the campground for further merriment, plus Wanda has offered to teach international folk dancing to those remaining.  </p>
<p>Hopefully I answered everyone's questions if not feel free to contact me directly (trishkri at yahoo.com).  I also wanted to thank everyone in advance that has been helping me - Carol for all of her suggestions and offers to help, ditto for Aili, Wanda and Pete for all of their advance legwork in the Charlestown area, Jay for the campground check, and Shannon for coordinating the food.  Hope to see everyone Saturday (under sunny skies!) </p>

Alan had mentioned nametags: one of Carol's many brilliant ideas in <br/>
the past was to wear an image of your personal stamp as a nametag. <br/>
We'll bring some of those "Hi, I'm" stickies for people to use if <br/>
they'd like. We'll also be bringing a canoe to play with.<br/>

Can't wait!<br/>

Sorry, I meant to add it in but didn't realize it was missing until <br/>
after I sent the message.  There is also a link on the What's New <br/>
LbNA page so I was hoping no one would notice.  Does this mean we <br/>
will see you there?<br/>
