What was this?  Was BeMa on a bender?  Nah - we were just trying to find out <br/>
way to Raven's Roost in the thick fog that had settled over the mountain.  <br/>
Our time was limited and the rain had finally let up so we had decided to <br/>
return to this beautiful look out (and to find the box that had been placed <br/>
there).  Last year, when the weather was clear and a beautiful 86 or so <br/>
degrees, the view from Raven's Roost was so gorgeous that we used it as the <br/>
backdrop to our holiday card.  This year we couldn't see a thing (which, in <br/>
it self was kind of a neat comparison).<br/>
<br/>
Emily's Elephant was waiting for us, vying for the kid's attention with this <br/>
really fat, reddish millipede (as thick as my finger -- no kidding -- <br/>
although I do have very graceful, delicate hands -- perfect for playing the <br/>
piano as Gra [grandma] always said [now if I had only liked to practice the <br/>
thing]).  We stamped her (the elephant, not the milipeed) in pink as an <br/>
homage to all those Warner Bros. cartoons which always showed the pink <br/>
elephants dancing around the guys' heads (although the kids preferred to <br/>
link it to Wanda on Fairly Odd Parents (the generation gap lives!...)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to BlueMoon for placing this box.  It sure made up for the missing <br/>
view!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Driving in the fog on a mountain is decidedly not fun!!  You can't see <br/>
a thing and the lanes are very narrow and curvy.  We would try and spot the <br/>
reflectors in the center of the road and hope that where we were turning was <br/>
actually an intersection and not a scenic overlook....<br/>
<br/>
P.P.S.  On the other hand -- driving down the mountain this year was a <br/>
cinch!!  Thanks to all the wonderful advice about going down in low gear!!  <br/>
It's great!!  Not only were we safe and not smelling burning rubber our <br/>
whole descent, but Da got an enormous kick out of saying "look Na -- no <br/>
feet" every two seconds!  The low gear slowed the car down to such a degree <br/>
(and in a really weird way, actually slowing down on the curbs as if on <br/>
automatic pilot) that he hardly touched the brakes at all.  Happily, he <br/>
decided to keep his hands on the wheel despite the thrill!<br/>
