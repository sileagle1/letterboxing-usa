headstone and look underneath is horrible.  However, many boxes at least here in <br/>
CT, have been placed in more tactful places within the cemetery, whether they <br/>
are in the stone wall surrounding the cemetery or in the hollow of a tree <br/>
etc....  Many of the boxes here in CT are history driven, taking you to the <br/>
gravesites of semi-famous people in local history.  I feel as though these boxes <br/>
have taught me much about local history.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that the boxes should be hidden with respect.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to say that the cemetery boxes are among my favorite.  <br/>
<br/>
To be honset, I'm a genealogist (amatuer) and I think cemeteries are <br/>
beautiful.  I also think they're very valuable, and that we should respect them.  It <br/>
makes me very sad when I see evidence of late-night parties (beer cans, empty <br/>
candy wrappers, etc) in a graveyard.<br/>
<br/>
I like the cemetery boxes because usually, at the time I visit, I seem to be <br/>
the only one there, and it's very peaceful.  Most of the cemetery boxes I've <br/>
found have been in very old grave yards, and I enjoy reading the old stones, <br/>
for the artistic/historical value.  I like that the boxes brought me there, <br/>
because I would otherwise not know where most of them were.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I've never been instructed to lift a headstone or move <br/>
anything in any way.  The boxes I've found in cemeteries have all been under trees <br/>
on the edge of the graveyard, or buried into a stone wall where they can be <br/>
accessed by moving only a couple rocks, and then replaced so that the wall is <br/>
intact when you're finished.  I also wouldn't lift a headstone if that was in <br/>
the directions.  That's disrespectful.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just yesterday I followed clues through a cemetary to locate a box.  I had mixed emotions about entering a cemetary for clues but it was a wonderful experience.  I read the tombstones and touched the old granite as I looked for clues.  I felt especially moved when I saw a gravestone of a baby with the date 1944 and someone was still tending a little garden at the site. Some of the stones were toppled over but not vandalized...they wer just old and worn.  I noticed dates back to the early 1800s.  It was a moving experience. It never would have occurred to me to take a walk through a cemetary on a warm September day....While I was wandering across the grass noticing all the names and dates the last thing on my mind was a letterbox.

I totally disagree with you. I think cemeteries are a<br/>
lovely place to hide boxes.  As a geneology nut  and<br/>
grand-daughter of genealogy nut I've spent alot of<br/>
time in cemeteries.  Boxes should be placed with<br/>
respect but I think it is perfectly OK. As with the<br/>
Underground railroad series in Lancaster. These boxes<br/>
were placed with permission and were a wonderful<br/>
learning experience.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with MaryAnn. If done properly cemetery boxes can be a great place to hide boxes. I found 2 in New Englad, and spent a lot of times reading the gravestones, learning about the residents and their struggles dung their lifetimes. It was moving and fascinating. And the Underground Railroad series in Lancaster is just wonderful. I learned about the first cemetery in this are not to specify what color someone had to be to be buried there, a local resident who was so against discrimination he insisted on being buried there and the epitaph on his tomb was wonderful. I did know Lacaster played a part in the Underground Railroad and really enjoyed learning more about this part of my state. Also, I believe the placer had permission with at least one of the boxes planted in a very old, historical cemetery.Now the lifting the tombstone part of the clues you describe does sound out of line to me, but I would have to check it out first to see if the placer is crossing not respecting the<br/>
 area as we all should be whenever planting any box, anywhere.<br/>

grand-daughter of genealogy nut I've spent alot of<br/>
time in cemeteries.  Boxes should be placed with<br/>
respect but I think it is perfectly OK. As with the<br/>
Underground railroad series in Lancaster. These boxes<br/>
were placed with permission and were a wonderful<br/>
learning experience.  <br/>

Having a place to "visit" with a loved one is very important to many people.  Many gravestones are lovingly chosen to let the spirit of the one who has passed live on for all to see.  Respect is the issue here.  Leave no traces, right?  <br/>

There is so much to learn from visits to cemeteries, especially the old ones, not to mention the opportunity to reflect on how precious time on earth really is.  The art found on turn of the century stones (at least here in New England) is fascinating.  You can tell a little something about the person buried by their gravestone, and if you spend some time in cemeteries you can get to know the style of old carvers.  While doing a little research recently on an ancient cemetery found in the woods, I learned that wheat and a sickle carved on a stone represented reaping of a soul and gathering a harvest for the next world.  That an hourglass depicted the fleeting passage of time.  That Angels were carved to assist in the passage from this world to the next.  That a broken tree meant that life was cut short.  I don't think that placing boxes in cemeteries is in bad taste (I've done it myself!)... if done<br/>
 properly, it could be a lasting tribute to be shared, and should be considered a priveledge if found.  MayEve<br/>

usually larger/heavier than one can lift? If a headstone were <br/>
small/light enough to be easily moved, it  would defeat the whole <br/>
purpose of being there as a permanent place marker.<br/>

  I have located 2 boxes in graveyards ("4 ft Under" - Rockford, IL &amp; "The Buffy Box" - Milwaukee, WI).  Both were hidden in respectful places, ie: near a wall, in a tree hollow, under a bush, etc.  I enjoyed finding both boxes, and am considering hiding a box in a local cemetary..  The cemetaries were quite and peaceful.  I got to see many unique and old headstones, some dating to the mid-1800's.  Perhaps the spirits of the departed like when the living visit?<br/>
<br/>
  I believe it's okay to hide boxes in cemetaries in they are placed in a respectful manner and do not disturb gravesites.  I feel the boxes should be placed in bushes, trees, holes in walls, under rocks...not under headstones or on/in graves in anyway.  We should all respect the final resting places of the dead, because they are someone's loved one.  Would you like if the graves/headstones of your loved ones were disturbed?<br/>
