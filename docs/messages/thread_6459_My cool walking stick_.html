<br/>
I have a really cool walking stick. It is purple and on the top is a <br/>
compass. There is a container on the side for collecting the bugs <br/>
that you find. I like looking for bugs and lizards. One time we were <br/>
looking under a step for a box, and Mom thought that a lizard(that <br/>
was hiding under the step) was a snake. She screammed! All the birds <br/>
that were hiding in the shrubs near by took off. That was cool.<br/>
<br/>
So are there any other KIDS on this board? <br/>
<br/>
 If so, how long have you been doing letterboxing? We just started. <br/>
We have found 4 and are getting ready to hide 3. <br/>

My son, who has not picked out a letterbox name as of yet, goes with me on<br/>
nearly every letterbox adventure.  He hid the very first letterbox in the<br/>
State of Oregon.  That was way back when there were less than 20 letterboxes<br/>
in this country.  He is now 9 and just placed another letterbox the other<br/>
day.  He doesn't really spend any time on the internet, at least not writing<br/>
e-mail.  He is an avid letterboxer though, and wants to start a letterboxing<br/>
club here in Portland.<br/>

<br/>
     Your walking stick sounds really neat!  We don't have walking <br/>
sticks, yet, but Mom always seems to find a nice one when we get <br/>
near the letterbox hiding spots because she's pretty squeamish <br/>
reaching into dark places (tree tummies &amp; all).  We saw a snake the <br/>
other day as we were placing two new letterboxes in our area.  It <br/>
was black with two green stripes down the length of its body.  <br/>
Pretty cool.  Mom says it was a garter snake.  She really likes <br/>
snakes but she won't touch them!!!<br/>
    The other day we saw some neat animals, too.  We were on our 1st <br/>
LB hunt and we came across a really big slug--it was over 7 inches <br/>
long!  It looked like a regular banana slug but it had tiger stripes <br/>
over 2/3rds of its body.  Yuck!  Thank goodness Mom didn't step on <br/>
it...what a mess that would have made!  I wonder if they taste like <br/>
bananas?  I'm sure my little brother trkr would like to know!  We <br/>
also saw two turtles sunbathing on a log--not bad considering we <br/>
live in the Pacific Northwest and 'it rains all the time'...  ha ha!<br/>
    We learned about letterboxing a couple of months ago on a <br/>
website--had to go travel around the US for a couple of months <br/>
thanks to the military--but when we got back home we started <br/>
searching right away.  So far, we've found 5 and have planted 2.  <br/>
Mom already has a couple more ready to place but can't 'finalize' <br/>
the trail yet thanks to some new buildings they're putting in near <br/>
here--so it will have to wait.  We're also researching several other <br/>
spots for new LBs right now, too.  Mom likes to take the historical <br/>
approach to her clues...that way we can still 'homeschool' while we <br/>
look for more letterboxes!<br/>

trkr is still tagging along!  Aren't little brothers cool?<br/>
