                    <div class="plaintext-content">I LIKE that idea.  I had already decided on the scrapbook idea.  Today I<br/>
took the pages with the clues and stamped that (on the one I found!).<br/>
But the pages are grungy from handling, and it would have been less<br/>
conspicuous had I not wanted to (try to) keep them - I could have folded<br/>
it up in my pocket if it weren't stuck in the front cover of a notebook!<br/>
If you mount the stamped paper when you get home, you can even do some<br/>
fun, artsy stuff - like layering them with colored papers- if that<br/>
appeals to you, anyway!  I'm trying to console myself because I am NOT<br/>
going to work toward the merit badges for my dogs, so I am looking for<br/>
fun ways to record our travels.  I'm also going to get a tripod for my<br/>
camera, so I can take pics of us along the way.<br/>

In addition to giving me an "excuse" while letterboxing, I actually take<br/>
a camera and record the view of the area or things such as signs in a<br/>
park, etc.  I include these in my "logbook" which is actually more of a<br/>
scrapbook.  I carry pieces of paper with me which I stamp (and if I<br/>
don't get a goodimage I can do it again) then I add them to my book when<br/>
I get home.<br/>

A camera is a *must* for us more Urbanized Letterboxers. Since <br/>
I've started hunting for boxes, I've spotted A Great Heron, a grey <br/>
fox, a painted turtle, a woodchuck, and a snake.<br/>
<br/>
In ONE weekend!<br/>
<br/>
This is most variety wildlife I've seen outside of a zoo in a <br/>
decade.<br/>
<br/>
(OK - The woodchuck's not so exotic... But he *was* a chunky <br/>
little fella, and it seemed unfair to exclude him.)<br/>

Once when I was without camera someone asked what I was doing and I said I was hunting for a certain type of venomous spider for a biology class. The questioner did not stick around long after that. :)<br/>
