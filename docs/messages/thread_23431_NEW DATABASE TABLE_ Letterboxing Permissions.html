This message is to announce that a new database table has been created<br/>
to allow the users of this group to compile a list of places, parks,<br/>
regions, counties, states, etc. where letterboxing is or has taken place.<br/>
<br/>
I have taken the liberty of adding in a few select places so you can<br/>
see how the fields should be filled in. If you have important<br/>
*positive* comments, please use the proper field... for example, CT<br/>
parks who participate in letterboxing should receive a comment in the<br/>
"Authorities Aware?" field.<br/>
<br/>
Please show your support for the letterboxing community as a whole by<br/>
adding your personal knowledge to the file. The idea behind this<br/>
"list" is to give ourselves reasonable, statistical ammunition to<br/>
fight the good fight for the freedom to go letterboxing!<br/>

Priviledges can be taken away if they are abused. We must remember the true spirit of Letterboxing where "i've found a neat place and i'd like to show it to you!" However we should not go trouncing through the woods, public, etc. assuming that we can put our plastic boxes just anywhere.<br/>
