Last year our older Girl Scout Troop held their end of the year <br/>
meeting as a picnic at a nearby park.  My husband and I placed boxes <br/>
around the area of the park we were at,within sight of the shelter <br/>
for our picnic. I breifed the girls on letterboxing.  We sent the <br/>
girls out in twos each starting at a different box with instructions <br/>
and clues to go on in numerical order until they found all 5 of <br/>
them.  Gave the adults time to set up the picnic.  We set a date <br/>
during the summer for travel to letterboxes in a nearby city.  <br/>
Between now and then we have set up letterboxing at two different <br/>
camp weekends and taken several more letterboxing finding trips. We <br/>
always gave out internet addresses and printed information for those <br/>
who wanted to do more on their own.  The girls have their own <br/>
favorite stamps.  I hope to get them to carve their own in the <br/>
future.  One girl is contemplating this service as her Gold Award <br/>
activity in our town.  At the weekend camping some took off with the <br/>
idea, some gave it a go, and some were completely in the dark.  I <br/>
have found it depends on how it is presented, how involved the adults <br/>
are(and how interested), and how successful their first attempts are <br/>
at finding the boxes.  Fortunately the first public box we found was <br/>
right on the money.  That made the next one which we never found <br/>
easier to take and also proved some are more involved than others.  <br/>
Didn't mean to get so wordy, but hope this helps.  Liik forward to <br/>
hearing of your efforts.<br/>
