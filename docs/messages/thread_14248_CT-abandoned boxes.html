Walden Preserve box that is considered abandoned was placed by her-- <br/>
we are available to become caretaker of it if she can't continue <br/>
taking it as hers. Also, Dead and Dreaming letterbox in Ackley <br/>
Cemetery is one we could easily adopt if the original placer needs <br/>
help. We don't want to overstep, but don't want to see boxes start <br/>
disappearing, either!--S.+S.Y.<br/>
