Sad news.  We have received an e-mail from the Audubon <br/>
Society in RI stating that our boxes at Kimball Refuge have been <br/>
removed.   Quotes from the letter follow:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I [Robert D. Kenney] just wanted to let you know that both of the <br/>
letterboxes at Kimball Wildlife Refuge in Charlestown are <br/>
missing and have definitely been stolen.  I know this, because I <br/>
took them...<br/>
<br/>
I am the chairman of the volunteer Kimball Advisory Committee <br/>
that plans all of the programs at the Refuge. We held our <br/>
monthly meeting this morning, and found out then about the <br/>
Audubon Society's official policy.  The Society's executive director, <br/>
policy director, and properties manager have jointly decided that <br/>
letterboxing is not an activity that will be allowed on any of the <br/>
Audubon properties...<br/>
<br/>
The Audubon Society of Rhode Island is a private landowner that <br/>
happens to allow public use of some of its properties for specific <br/>
purposes and under restrictive conditions.  Even if the Society's <br/>
decision had gone the other way, both of the Kimball letterboxes <br/>
have specific aspects that we would have objected to and <br/>
insisted that you change before making them public...<br/>
<br/>
Our policy is to keep walkers as much as possible on the <br/>
marked trails, as opposed to [down] "the faint trail," which won't <br/>
stay so faint if it gets lots of traffic. "<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please be alerted that the Kimball boxes are no more and that <br/>
this decision may affect boxes placed elsewhere.<br/>

As they said, it is private property and they can do as they wish. I <br/>
don't think defying them will accomplish anything but ill will. I <br/>
would suggest instead someone in that area contact them about their <br/>
specific concerns and discuss the issue. Unlike government lands, I <br/>
don't think there is any rational "that belongs to all of us" <br/>
argument to be made. Not that such an argument would go anywhere with <br/>
government lands.<br/>

that one drawback is the public availability of location info. I would<br/>
dislike seeing your advances in popularizing this sport reversed into<br/>
secrecy, but that would make this kind of confrontation less likely. So far<br/>
as public land use, I often obtained "Special Use Permits" from refuge and<br/>
Nat'l Park land managers when setting up strange projects and leaving<br/>
equipment in place in Arizona.<br/>

I have in the past months since I have been working at<br/>
the Eastern Mountain Sports in Manchester have been<br/>
involved in a conversation of a similar topic with a<br/>
representative from the Avalonia Land Conservancy that<br/>
is home to a few letterboxes as well (Elephant Walk,<br/>
and a few other unmentionables). I may have posted<br/>
this note before but I feel that I should mention it<br/>
once again in light of "The Audobon Event." (HA! There<br/>
I offically named it just like the media does to stuff<br/>
going on in the world)<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, we had a wonderful conversation. It ended<br/>
in an understanding that letterboxing intends in no<br/>
way to harm the environment and that the subject would<br/>
be brought up to their board of directors at the next<br/>
meeting and that they would contact me. I have since<br/>
not heard anything from them but will be seeking their<br/>
input in the near future since I do love letterboxing<br/>
(even with my recent hiatus from it but there's a<br/>
reason for that) but also have a great respect for our<br/>
mother earth (oh that sounded groovy).<br/>
<br/>
In light of any environmental impact concerns I will<br/>
be reviewing locations of any letterboxes placed on an<br/>
Eastern Mountain Sports outing and any others that I<br/>
have placed as well.<br/>
<br/>
At this point all i can say is that we really have no<br/>
right to letterbox and that we must treat any tract,<br/>
conservancy, park, nursery, arboretum, etc., with<br/>
respect toward how it is managed. I know we all know<br/>
these things too. I also think that it would be good<br/>
for us to all put our heads together when we have our<br/>
gatherings (and there are a bunch of them springing up<br/>
aren't there?) to come up with new ways that we can do<br/>
even more to lessen the impact that letterboxing CAN<br/>
have on the environment. It is in my opinion our<br/>
responsibility to not be ignorant about our impact. Of<br/>
course I am not saying that any of us are.<br/>
