                    <html><body>Even though the snow has hampered boxing in the northern/inland parts of the state, the eastern coast of CT seems to be undisturbed of snow and letterbox rich!  I've had the joy of finding quite a few letterboxes in the Mystic and other coastal areas!  I've found all of these in good condition:
<br/>
<br/>Captain's Walk
<br/>Bastille Day Hitchhiker (placed at an undisclosed location)
<br/>Peace
<br/>Sailor Joe and Bingo
<br/>Joe Pye Weed
<br/>Otus the Owl
<br/>Coneflower
<br/>Ringneck Snake
<br/>Wood Frog
<br/>DPNC Letterbox
<br/>Spotted Salamander
<br/>All Six Oriental Medicine boxes
<br/>Inn at the Beginning
<br/>Chinese Food to Go Hitchhiker
<br/>
<br/>I've also planted or in the process of planting two mystery boxes, and have also planted one hitchhiker: Traveling Troubadour Hitchhiker.  BTW.... if anyone finds my hitchhiker, please let me know before sending it on its way, if possible.  I think I'm going to need to mount the stamp because I'm afraid it may get broken. Maybe there can be a way I can get a block and glue to you :-)
<br/>
<br/>Anyway, if you are in CT or RI, go to Eastern Coastal CT!  There's very little snow in Mystic, Groton etc! 
<br/>
<br/>Happy Trails!
