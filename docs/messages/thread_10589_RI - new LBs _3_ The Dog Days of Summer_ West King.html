A Letterbox Series for Any Season<br/>
Great Swamp Management Area<br/>
West Kingston, RI<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: Moonstone_baby<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Clues easy.  Hike approx. 5 miles. Excellent for Mt. <br/>
Bikes.<br/>
<br/>
This is a hunting area so mandatory florescent orange required <br/>
October through end of February.  Observe all local &amp; posted <br/>
regulations.  Take proper precautions against disease carrying deer <br/>
ticks and poison ivy.<br/>
<br/>
Background:  People may think it odd to name a letterbox series <br/>
planted in January "The Dog Days of Summer."  This series is <br/>
enjoyable during every season and the scenery in the swamp is very <br/>
different from season to season.  I think my favorite seasons to hike <br/>
here are spring and fall.  The series is named in honor of my <br/>
favorite hiking companions, my three Black Labs: Katie, Indy, and <br/>
Sky.  On this hike you will pass by Laurette's Adventure's of<br/>
Tin Tin <br/>
letterbox and Wanda's Holly Tree Impromptu letterbox so be sure<br/>
to <br/>
bring those clues with you.<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions: Take Rt 138 to West Kingston.  Turn west onto <br/>
Liberty Lane.  Follow the road approximately 2 miles to parking area <br/>
at end.<br/>
<br/>
