HI RRC,<br/>
Some folks use an iron to transfer. I haven't tried this technique <br/>
as I'm allergic. I generally use the old tried and true soft lead <br/>
pencil, rub with a spoon technique. With really intricate images I <br/>
scrub the surface of the carving medium(I use PZ Kut)with a paper <br/>
towel that has been wetted with acetone. Then I place the image face <br/>
down and use the spoon technique. The image transfers and then I go <br/>
over it completely with a ball point so that won't rub off during <br/>
carving. I would imagine that this last technique would work with <br/>
pink stuff or mastercarve. The acetone changes the surface of PZ Kut <br/>
slightly and makes it gummier and more receptive for the image. I <br/>
would imagine that the type of printer you are using would make a <br/>
big difference in the method you use.<br/>

<br/>
I have been using this method recently ... too impatient to fire up the iron.  Works great <br/>
for quick carves.  I draw/trace my original image on tracing paper ... no backwards <br/>
lettering this way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With really intricate images I <br/>

I will try this method ... just have take some TIME to buy that acetone!<br/>

&gt; would imagine that the type of printer you are using would make a <br/>

<br/>
Don is correct!  I was lucky enough on my very first try, my sig stamp!  I used an iron with <br/>
a copy from a copier using toner, not a laser jet, or inkjet.  I ironed the image on <br/>
mastercarve and the image was perfect (put a thin layer of cloth betweeen the iron and <br/>
paper).  I haven't been as successful since then ... tried using the pink stuff and the grey <br/>
material and I melted some.  I have to turn the iron down, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
good luck,<br/>

I've used the heat transfer/iron method for a few years using images <br/>
printed on an HP LaserJet printer. This works on PZKut and less well <br/>
on Speedy Stamp. I do not know about other carving medium.Inkjet <br/>
printers will not work.I also do not know if other laser printers <br/>
will yield acceptable results. Some toner based copier images will <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of the iron/heat transfer method, irons seem to have minds <br/>
of their own. Some of them have hot and cool spots, leak water, etc.  <br/>
I use a Rowenta Pro iron on the hightest setting and a blast of <br/>
steam. I place the printed image (on regular old copy paper) on the <br/>
carving medium without cutting it out. I place another plain sheet on <br/>
top. Then I set the iron lightly and squarely on both sheets and give <br/>
it one blast of steam. This serves to keep the paper from sliding <br/>
around. The Rowenta iron has a fairly large volume of steam. Note <br/>
that if your iron has a tendency to drip water when you use the steam <br/>
setting, use a dry iron instead.  <br/>
<br/>
I then begin to press the cord end of the iron on both sheets for a <br/>
couple of seconds. The cord end has fewer steam vents and therefore, <br/>
less chance of voids in the transfer process.I remove the iron after <br/>
a very short time (2 seconds), very slightly lift a corner of the <br/>
paper the graphic is on to check transfer progress. Done perfectly, <br/>
the image should be very black. Allow the carving medium to cool <br/>
completely.<br/>
<br/>
This is truly a trial and error process and usually requires a few 2-<br/>
3 second applications of the iron. It will work with or without <br/>
steam, though without, you will have to take care that the paper does <br/>
not slip.<br/>
<br/>
Important to know is Speedy Stamp has a lower melt point than PZKut <br/>
so more care must be taken or the medium will melt into the ink on <br/>
your graphic or the surface will become glazed and hardened and <br/>
nearly impossible difficult to carve.<br/>
<br/>
This method absolutely requires experimentation with your iron and <br/>
likely some wasted carving medium until you find the combination of <br/>
temp/steam/numbers of applications of the iron that works for you. <br/>
I've used this for well over one hundred stamps and it duplicates <br/>
permanently and without smearing on the medium all the detail from <br/>
laser printed graphics that you could ever want. If you have any <br/>
questions, please feel free to email me off list since I no longer <br/>
actively read this list. <br/>

I only have ink-jet printers . . . I wonder if there is a method to use those. (The nearest copy machine to me is about 25 minutes away, lol). I thought about printer on photo paper or acetate or something that won't soak up the ink as fast . . . but haven't tried it yet. I'm going to try your method using an inkjet print as see what happens.<br/>
Thanks for your advice.<br/>

Before I bought my laser printer, I used to make transfers by pressing <br/>
carving material onto the paper as soon as it came out of my ink jet <br/>
printer (while the ink was still wet). It's worth a try with your printer.<br/>

1) get as much contrast in your image as possible - in black and white<br/>
2) print on an ink jet printer in "best" mode<br/>
3) cut to size immediately<br/>
4) place image print side down on carving medium<br/>
5) rub backside of paper vigorously with butter knife or other smooth edged tool<br/>

~ this works best for me, because the ink doesn't smear as I'm carving...I use this method almost exclusively.<br/>

This website was very helpful!  I appreciate the level of detail in<br/>
how you use the xylene for carving.  I immediately made a couple of<br/>
calls to art stores in the area and was able to locate the pen here in<br/>
Santa Rosa, CA.  I'll be trying your method on my next stamp...which<br/>
is coming up soon. Thanks!<br/>

I still prefer to use pencil on the printed image and rubbing it <br/>
upside down on the stamps.  I don't carve incredibly detailed and <br/>
the process allows me to make artistic decisions as I go. Or is that <br/>
artistic license.  I often have to clean it up as I carve, often <br/>
referring back to the original image, but I like that.<br/>

IMHO I find that this really botches up the lettering unless you're<br/>
only doing something that requires block capitals. But....that's just<br/>
me and my personal style of stamp images also.<br/>
<br/>
I find for a transfer, that a heated iron works - but if you're also<br/>
careful...you can use Citra Solve which is a very acidic concentrated<br/>
household cleanser that works well. It also works very nicely on<br/>
fabric - linen and other types if you're transferring copied/laser images.<br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>

Hi GR. <br/>
Try scrubbing your carving medium with the acetone on a paper towel, <br/>
then place the image face down and rub you will find it transfers <br/>
great. This way you will never get it too wet.The scrubbing changes <br/>
the carving medium just slightly, and makes it receptive for the <br/>
image.<br/>
