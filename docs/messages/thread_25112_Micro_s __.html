                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not too keen on prescription bottles (I'm assuming you're talking  <br/>
about the orange, plastic ones with the white tops).  I don't think  <br/>
they're waterproof.  Try putting a piece of tissue in one, then  <br/>
holding it under water for a period of time.  The lid "clicks" shut,  <br/>
but can be turned backwards (not opening, but letting water in).  35mm  <br/>
film canisters (still available from some photo processors, maybe...)  <br/>
work well, but oh, they're so tiny!<br/>
<br/>
Good question.  I'd like to see some answers as well.<br/>
<br/>
My local photo processor who gave me some canisters suggested super- <br/>
glueing the rubber stamp on the outside end of the canister, thus  <br/>
leaving more room inside for the tiny log book.  (Rubber stamps can  <br/>
take the water better than paper.)  I told him that he was certainly  <br/>
thinking "outside the box."<br/>

I do like the white prescriptions bottles, they are much more secure than<br/>
the orange type.  In my experience.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've tried quite a few things for microboxes and each has its good and bad points.  I started out using the white film canisters (where the top fits into the canister) and found that they let water in over time.  When I test them under water they don't leak, but I think what happens is that the finder does not put the logbook back in properly and the top does not get sealed.  I have had better luck with the <br/>
black film canisters (top fits over canister), plus they are better camouflaged with the black and grey colors.  Many times I then attach a large, unwound paper clip using Goop glue and camo tape so I can hang the box in an evergreen tree.  You can still get film canisters at places that sell film (e.g. drugstores) by just asking.  As far as logs go, I make my own by cutting 10 strips of typing paper a little less than the depth of the canister (about 1 5/8"), fold them in half and staple.  I then roll it up and put in the canister, leaving room for the stamp in the middle.  The stamp can be up to 7/8" wide by 1 5/8" long, small but not impossible, especially if the subject of your carving is long and skinny.<br/>
<br/>
For something a little bigger, white medicine containers (e.g. aspirin or vitamins) work well and the ones with the plastic seal in the lid (usually kid-proof top that requires pushing down while turning) don't leak.  The problem with most of them is that the top is narrower than the bottom, so rolled up logs would be very hard to get out.  To get around this, I create logbooks a little shorter than the depth of the container and a little wider than the opening, then bend them lengthwise to fit.  The log is pretty narrow so might not allow some to stamp in, but the container allows you to carve a bigger stamp than in film canisters.  For camoflauge you can use camo tape, but I have found it easier to paint them using Krylon Fusion in dark green or brown.  Also, the top of the container is great for tying fishing line so I can hang it in trees.<br/>
<br/>
Altoid Tins and anything metal don't work very well since they rust, and prescription plastic containers (thin orange plastic) crack too easily.  I have recently tried using plastic spice containers with screw-tops and they look promising.  They are a good size and don't get narrow at the top, but not sure how the thin plastic will last over time.  Also, getting the food smell out is an extra problem since animals can pick up the slightest odor.  After washing thoroughly, I spray the inside with bug spray, but not sure if that works or not.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's an idea I have considered as well, but I usually don't because I'm worried that the stamp being outside will erode more easily. Probably not that much, but it's always stopped me from trying it.<br/>
