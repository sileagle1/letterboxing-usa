<br/>
Saturday, took a trip to the Prairie Peace Park near Lincoln, NE.  Who <br/>
knew walking through grass could be so challenging?  Great hunt, and <br/>
lovely stamp!  Introduced 3 newbies to the "sport," including one who <br/>
was skeptical to begin with but is now a convert!<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, stopped at the Wakefield Arboretum for the Conestoga stamp... <br/>
alas, could not locate it.  Has anyone seen this one, or is it AWOL?  <br/>
The last direction was a little fuzzy, so it may just have been be.  <br/>
Beautiful walk through the woods, in any case.<br/>
