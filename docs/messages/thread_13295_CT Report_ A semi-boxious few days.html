                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm currently working on the Black Dog of the Hanging Hills in Meriden.  I <br/>
have successfully found two of the four boxes before it started to pour on <br/>
Saturday!  I'm hoping to get another on Wednesday if I can get out of work on <br/>
time....<br/>
<br/>
Today, I ventured out to Farmington and West Hartford on my way home from <br/>
work and found the first of the Swamp Shade boxes (I already had Daffy's Downfall <br/>
from a previous visit), King of the Kame (what an area that is!), Trees of 3, <br/>
and Phoenix Tree.  Phoenix Tree doesn't have a stamp however, but I stamped <br/>
into its logbook anyway.  There was an e-mail address in the logbook, which I <br/>
will attempt to contact to see if they want to put a stamp into the box.  I was <br/>
unable to find the French Huguanots ( I just can't spell that word!) so I'll <br/>
have to do the hike all over again.... that's ok though, since I already did <br/>
the hike for the MDC box a while back!  BTW... if you are going over the land <br/>
bridge stated in teh clues for Trees of 3, watch out for black water moccasins. <br/>
 I saw two babies today sunning themselves on the banks.  Very scary!  (since <br/>
I'm afraid of snakes!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to get Shooting Star.  I went to the <br/>
UCONN Health Center three times today, and all three times, the pond area was <br/>
full of people!  I think I have to try it at 7 a.m.  or on a rainy day!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting everyone!<br/>
