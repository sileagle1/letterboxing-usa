Superstore near us had a whole aisle for stamping stuff - it was in <br/>
the art/drawing section of the store.  Most of one side of the aisle <br/>
was already carved stamps, but at the end they had stamp carving <br/>
tools and Staedtler Master Carve Artist Carving Block.  It's 2 1/2" <br/>
x 5" x 3/4".  Because it's 3/4" thick, we sliced it down the middle <br/>
and got twice as much carving material.  Good luck!<br/>

&gt; Greetings all!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been hooked on letterboxing for about a year now, and just <br/>
&gt; started placing my own boxes and carving my own stamps, which I <br/>
think <br/>
&gt; may almost be *more* fun than finding boxes...maybe...nah...well, <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; least it gets me though the winter months.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My question is this- (I've been searching the archives for about <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; hour now, and can't find the answer, so if you all are burnt out <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; this question, I'm sorry :))<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are there any specific stores that carry bigger carving medium <br/>
than <br/>
&gt; erasers?  My first two stamps, carved last night, were on crumbly <br/>
&gt; icky "general" erasers.  (So anyone who comes across my "Wandering <br/>
&gt; Lotus" hitchhiker, please keep that in mind.  The stamp will <br/>
probably <br/>
&gt; fall to pieces before it leaves the state!)  I've read "speedy-<br/>
cut" <br/>
&gt; and PZ-Cut, but where to find...? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any suggestions would be great.  I've already tried Jo-Anns and <br/>
&gt; Michaels, and the workers there all looked at me like I was <br/>
speaking <br/>
&gt; Mongolian.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
