We were able to be discreet for the Wapiti and Marsh Boxes and are<br/>

We landed the beautiful Winking Eagle Box placed by Windairen and<br/>
Plundering Bunny.  What a wonderful stamp!!!  We really loved finding<br/>
this letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
As for The Locomotive and Willard's Elephant boxes there was absolutely<br/>
no way to be discreet in these areas and, therefore, we didn't make much<br/>

there, as well?  <br/>
<br/>
It was, after all, the Tuesday afternoon when admission is free (as<br/>
opposed to $7.50 per adult), so everybody in the whole wide world was<br/>
there with their families enjoying the exotic animals and wonderful<br/>
weather.<br/>
<br/>
It might be worth it to actually pay to get in sometime when it is less<br/>
busy to seek the other boxes...maybe.  Depending on if they are there or<br/>
not.  We were so happy to nab Winking Eagle and I'm sure the other Zoo<br/>
letterboxes would be delightful finds.  Please advise if the other 4<br/>
boxes still reside in their hiding spots.  I can't believe we overlooked<br/>
Wapiti and Marsh, but you never know.  It would be nice to know if<br/>
Locomotive and Willard's are indeed there, as well.  <br/>

Thanks for a fun day at the zoo!<br/>
