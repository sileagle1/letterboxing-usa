<br/>
good for you for taking the time to read up and research first. Also join the newboxers talk list at newboxers@yahoogroups.com . It's a great resource for us newer boxers to ask those types of questions that make some people go "duh!". Also there might be a regional group for your area to get you in touch with your local boxers but I don't know which one it is. <br/>
<br/>
I remember when I first posted to this list in January. I thought it would be a nice little hobby for us to do every now and then. Someone who welcomed me said something like "welcome to the addiction...soon you will planning vacations around box locations" and I thought no way man! These folks need to get a life!<br/>
<br/>
Since then I've camped in MD, driven to VA, WV, NJ flown to NH (and am going again in a few weeks) and am planning a trip to CT before the end of the year, and driven to my local airpot to meet out of town boxers for image exchanges. Just to go letterboxing. And I've only been doing this for 9 months! LOL! Welcome and enjoy the ride...<br/>
