I am in the midst of creating an entire Web site devoted to <br/>
letterboxing that will house the clues to the boxes I am placing <br/>
(it's not quite ready yet). Should I ask for the entire site to be <br/>
added for Michigan, or should I provide the clues separately? What's <br/>
the best way?<br/>

<br/>
-Send your clues to this list for folks to see and maybe print out <br/>

us "LB geeks, web-masters, techno-geeks" when you have your own site. We<br/>
just update the maps and link it to your site and instructions.. and it<br/>

&gt; <br/>

&gt; letterboxing that will house the clues to the boxes I am placing <br/>
&gt; (it's not quite ready yet). Should I ask for the entire site to be <br/>

I think either way will work fine. Just set up your site the way you <br/>
like it best, and we will put in the link. I would think that if all <br/>
your clues were clearly accessible from your home page, we would just <br/>
link to it.<br/>
