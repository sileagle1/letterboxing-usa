You got yourself on the list, you can take yourself off the list the exact same way.  Ask nicely and I'll gladly show you exactly how to do it.  Until then, you're stuck with the list until you can figure it out or someone else is a bit more benevolent than I am.  Have a nice day.<br/>

Lets lighten up a bit. I contacted the business that has been receiving the LBNA chat list. Some one listed them to receive the list, and they did not even know how to access the LBNA home page. I have forwarded the link to the home page with instructions how to unsub. We apparently have been used as a micro jammer to flood a business with unwanted Emails. To folks just trying to do business our list can be very time consuming and "CRAP". One person's garbage is another person's treasure. Don <br/>
