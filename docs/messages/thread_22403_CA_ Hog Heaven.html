hog hunt in Red Bluff, CA. Happy to report 15 beautiful and amazing hogs bagged <br/>
(and released, of course) plus an additional 2 and a little hitchhiker to <br/>
boot! The kicker was that we met, on the way out, another couple just going in for <br/>
a hunt of their own--Mysterygal and Boatman! So COOL!! (An additional box to <br/>
be listed soon. . .)<br/>
<br/>
This was a 2-day venture as the 102* heat forced us in on Thursday to return <br/>
Friday morning with temps starting out about 25* cooler. Took us 3+ hours to <br/>
get them all each being found with no trouble. (Great clues, Don &amp; Gwen!) What <br/>
a wonderful tribute to our vernerable letterboxer friend, Funhog.<br/>
<br/>
Continued north and found 2 actual Funhog boxes (among others) at Mt. Shasta <br/>
and So. Oregon. Was surprised to see so few had stamped in before us==5 and 6 <br/>
respectfully and we were the first to stamp in this year! Get out there and <br/>
find these wonderful plants by That Great Hog.<br/>

stamps can make? Thank you soooooo much. Funhog<br/>

That's definitely the way to do it. The Aha! moments are plentiful we'll tell <br/>
you that. Something else too: you can really feel the love up there. When <br/>
you're able to get to Red Bluff, you're sure to feel the warm fuzzies all over, <br/>

We added a box to the area too which will be posted within a day or so along <br/>
with 3 others we planted in Ashland, OR. <br/>

Okay, I have a question now.  I knew that the boxes were close to OR, <br/>
but are they close to Ashland?  My grandparents live there and I have <br/>
been toying with going out to visit (now if I could just find the time <br/>
to get away again).  I didn't think that it would give me a chance to <br/>
find Hog Heaven though.  I hadn't looked that closely at the exact <br/>
location of the series.  I was just happy to be able to carve a stamp <br/>
for a letterboxer I've admired from afar.  If they are near Ashland, <br/>
that ups my motivation to head that way :)<br/>

We planted 3 new boxes in Lithia Park in Ashland, OR. (one is attached to our <br/>
original Shakespeare box making it a 2-box series so you have to read the <br/>
clue to that original box) I think the hand-carved stamps are some of our best. <br/>
We also planted a box at Hog Heaven in Red Bluff, CA a good 1 1/2 hours south <br/>
of Ashland.<br/>

fun!  I have wanted to find the Shakespeare box for a while.  I love <br/>
the festival and I love Lithia Park.  Unfortunately it has been <br/>
years since I've been out there.  I was raised by my dad and my <br/>
mom's family doesn't always know what to do with us.  Since the <br/>
family in Ashland is from my mom's side, well, you can guess.  I do <br/>
hope to make it out sometime again though.  Now I have more boxes to <br/>
go look for!<br/>
