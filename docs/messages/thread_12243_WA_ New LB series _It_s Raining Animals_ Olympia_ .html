It's Raining Animals Letterbox Series (3)<br/>
<br/>
Harry Fain's Legion Park<br/>
20th Ave SE<br/>
Olympia<br/>
Thurston County<br/>
Washington<br/>

<br/>
Directions:  Take I-5 to Exit 105 (State Capitol/City Center/Port of <br/>
Olympia), heading toward Port of Olympia, bear North onto E Bay Dr <br/>
(it will turn into Plum St SE), turn right (East) on Union Ave SE, <br/>
then turn right (South) onto Eastside St SE, then turn left (East) <br/>
onto 20th Ave SE.  Harry Fain's Park will be on your right.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  The 2.33 acres this quaint little gem of a park were donated <br/>
by Harry Fain to the City of Olympia in 1933.  The residents later <br/>
built a playground and trails in the wooded hollow.  Olympia <br/>
Watershed Park is just across the street if you're interested in <br/>
other letterboxes in the region.  The letterboxes in Harry Fain's <br/>
park are all 35mm film canister microletterboxes--just the right <br/>
size for this tiny little park.<br/>
<br/>
Clue:  The weatherperson forecasted rain but that was obviously <br/>
wrong.  It actually rained animals instead!  Come see for yourself--<br/>
better bring a strong umbrella!  From the swing for two, take the <br/>
trail at 105* to a table for many.  Continue East between 2 giants, <br/>
then keep steel diamonds on your left, head down the hill to the its <br/>
hollow where you turn right on a small trail, a little turtle lies <br/>
tucked in an Eastern cubby hole among roots of the 1st cedar you <br/>
reach.  Head back to the diamonds and continue South up the hill.  <br/>
At the corner head West, down the hill, but there's no time to play, <br/>
for more boxes lie in your way.  Instead, head Northwest further <br/>
still, past an old cedar stump, covered in ivy and moss.  Continue <br/>
past a multiheaded maple to another corner of sorts, head round a <br/>
bend, past swings and a balancing act of sorts, further past 2 <br/>
steering wheels to 3 confused tires.  From them, head 240* to a <br/>
knobby tree where your happy little hippo lies tucked under some <br/>
licheny moss on its Southwestern side.  A Gator of a bonus?  Like a <br/>
stalactite in a Southern cave,  your gator hangs out under big toys <br/>
by the yellow slippery slide.  Please be discreet, for this is a <br/>
busy little park.<br/>
