new boxes that have appeared since my last visit to NM and made sure that I had time to hunt some/all down. I <br/>
suceeded on five of them: Enchanted Winds, Los Vaqueros, Dormant Dragon, Osiris' Secret and Ski Bear. Kudos <br/>
to Baby Bear and A-Bear for making handmade stamps for their boxes. Dunk Productions unique presentation <br/>
with Los Vaqueros is also noteworthy. I attempted to find the Santa Barbara letterbox but at about 8000 feet <br/>
the road was under snow, I had no chains and the clue mentioned the trail going uphill... it did not bode well for <br/>
letterboxing. This one will have to wait for another day.<br/>
<br/>
I also checked on all of the boxes I have placed on past trips. All but one are alive and well. La Caja de Oro is <br/>
no longer amongst the living. It had narrowly escaped mishap twice in the past and had been rescued by a <br/>
kindly geocacher and a letterboxer. Since it was in a heavily traveled location, I decided that it was lucky to <br/>
have survived for over a year. It will not be replaced. <br/>
<br/>
Just so the small letterbox population in this state doesn't decrease, I decided that a new one was in order. <br/>
The clue will soon follow on the Talk List. This box is in good company. Osiris' Secret is close at hand. <br/>
