Clues:<br/>
<br/>
I found Alice in Wonderland today. It seems that the king had declared <br/>
himself a Boulevard and when Alice questioned his decision the king send an <br/>
army of cards after her. In a panic Alice asked the Cheshire cat for help <br/>
and the gave her some directions on what to do. He said, "Go to the pit of <br/>
Horseshoes and look for a four fingered oak tree. You should be safe if you <br/>
stay inside it." So she followed his directions and snuggled down beneath <br/>
the leaves, safe in the arms of the four fingered oak, hidden from the army <br/>
of cards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please make sure the re-hide this box well. Its location is often visited <br/>
by children.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
