this area and have managed to see many wonderful spots virtually unknown to Pacific Northwest Letterboxers. <br/>
I'm so pleased to have sent them to Crooked River Ranch Letterbox #4 on the anniversary of their second <br/>
year as boxers. Anymore intrepid outatowners coming for a visit?<br/>
<br/>
Last weekend was a springlike mixture in Central Oregon: drizzle, snow, grey skies and blazing sun. The desert <br/>
wildflowers are just beginning. I checked on four of my boxes while I was there: Crooked River Ranch #1, #2 <br/>
and #4 as well as the Mariposa Lily box at Smith Rock. All are alive and have been visited at least once but are <br/>
positively begging for attention. It seem that one of these boxes it mighty popular with geocachers but their <br/>
signatures are not nearly as exciting as a rubber stamp. Funhog<br/>
