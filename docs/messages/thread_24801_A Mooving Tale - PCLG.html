                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently I visited the PCLG Mystery box "A Mooving Tale". I am checking <br/>
on all the PCLG boxes as I have adopted with them with permission from <br/>
PCLG.  The box had the original log and stamp removed (the stamp was <br/>
not in great shape when I saw it early last year) and a new stamp had <br/>
been carved and left in its place. (A really good carving too).  The <br/>
question here, is who did it?, as there was no info left behind on the <br/>
identity of the carver.  I left a new log in the box with a note <br/>
written inside thanking the mystery person. I would be glad to speak to <br/>
this "unofficial adopter" to see if they would like to take over the <br/>
box or I will just keep it under the PCLG name.  Any info would be <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
Thank, John<br/>
