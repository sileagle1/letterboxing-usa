That's not quite true -- the LBNA site doesn't really take a stand. Here's <br/>
the link to the "What is a pace?" FAQ:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq.html#028<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't matter which definition people use, but the fact that it has an <br/>
ambiguous definition is the problem. Letterbox placers and finders simply <br/>
can't "assume" one definition is "correct."<br/>

&gt; Silent Doug is right; LbNA does not define pace<br/>
<br/>
Should it?<br/>
<br/>
I think the answer on the faq is the right answer, given the<br/>
question, tho.  Of course, if we replaced that section with <br/>
"it is a step", it may have the same meaning (as has been <br/>
astutely pointed out), and we could save a little bw :-)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it pretty much does define it to be a step if you <br/>
have nothing else to go on (that's what the last paragraph says).<br/>
(It really says that if you have no information, you have an<br/>
80% chance of being right if you assume it was a step, and the<br/>
person who placed it is about your size and responded to the <br/>
poll ...), ... and, of course, if you _do_ have something to <br/>
go on, you don't need a definition, so it really is taking a <br/>
stand, sort of.<br/>
<br/>
But, to the extent that it makes sense for "LbNA" to standardize<br/>
for the hobby (and that is a different kettle of fish altogether),<br/>
the preponderance of information does indicate a step is the <br/>
"right" answer, for those who wish for a right answer.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and I should know better than to trust my memory these days.<br/>
<br/>
On the contrary.  Your memory is doing the right thing in <br/>
consolidating a large block of gizz into a concise factoid <br/>
that has a large probability of being more useful than competing<br/>
factoids (we prefer the more technical-sounding term "meme";<br/>
yet another KoF ..., but anyway)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, its supposed to be a Zen thing (if it were _actually_ <br/>
a Zen thing, of course, there would be no need to say its a Zen<br/>
thing ... it just shows what a poor faq writer we are).  <br/>
<br/>

There really are no rules. And no average. So do what makes you happy and if<br/>
you want, you can put a definition at the beginning of your clues.<br/>
Pace = 1 step<br/>
or Pace = 2 steps<br/>
or Pace = heel to toe steps<br/>

In my short (so far) letterboxing career, this is what I've done, also.  If <br/>
the clues say, "go twelve paces to the large stump on the right," and they <br/>
don't specify what they're calling a "pace," then I go twelve steps, and look <br/>
around.  If there's no large stump anywhere around, I'll go twelve more steps, to <br/>
equal twelve paces, and the stump is usually somewhere around there.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, very often clues will say "paces" when they really mean "steps". Usually <br/>
I assume that paces mean steps unless someone specifies otherwise....BUT, as <br/>
has been said already...<br/>
in orienteering, in military, in outdoor/wildlife management etc: <br/>
a pace = two steps <br/>
a step =  is counted for each and every footfall<br/>
<br/>
I have never used a measured pace in letterboxing, but I have used it to pace <br/>
off distances when doing wildlife management plans etc. I also use it with <br/>
kids when teaching orienteering courses. Most people's (aged ~ 10 to adult) pace <br/>
falls between 4 and 6 feet (ie in two steps you travel, say, 5 feet).I'm not <br/>
sure if that helps.<br/>
