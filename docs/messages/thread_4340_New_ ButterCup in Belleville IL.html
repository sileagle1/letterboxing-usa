 ButterCup  <br/>

 ButterCup is on a mission! <br/>
 Help Her save the World before Bedtime!! <br/>
<br/>
 You can help by meeting her at Rotary Park on 6th street in Belleville IL.<br/>
 [ N 38 30.910 W 089 59.440 ]<br/>

<br/>
 What is IT ? <br/>
!!!! <br/>
 A star? <br/>
 I don't think so. <br/>
 But stand there anyway. <br/>
 Head SE for 20 steps. <br/>
 Then due East for 14 strides. <br/>
 Turn south, take 9 steps to a little trail. <br/>
 Be careful of the wicked looking tree on your right! <br/>
 Head west on trail until the Star is 320 degrees NW. <br/>
 ButterCup is under the broken concrete. <br/>
 The cinder block is the only chunk you will need to move. <br/>
 Put on your gloves and reach into the hole for ButterCup.<br/>
 There will be two identical containers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 As long as you have the clues this will be an easy find. The hard part will <br/>
be in trying to be inconspicuous. Bring along a plastic bag to pick up trash <br/>
and no one will ask questions. Mj spent a lot of time finding snail shells. <br/>
:o) . Be sure to completely close ALL ziplocks.<br/>
 Please carefully replace all the rocks so that the boxes are not washed away <br/>
in a heavy storm AND are hidden from prying eyes! <br/>
Bring gloves for reaching into dark, wet, buggy holes.<br/>
