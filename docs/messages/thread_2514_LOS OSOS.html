We found your boxes safe and dry over the weekend.  Enjoyed the hike with<br/>
our dogs...so very cool under the oaks.   Don and Gwen<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Wow....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Talk about your hot topics!  =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of my friends who read my clues for the Los Osos Oaks series<br/>
&gt; commented recently that he hates all the "legalise" in it, which I<br/>
&gt; thought was kind of amusing because I didn't think it was<br/>
&gt; particularly bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most of the warnings I put in it weren't to protect my butt, though,<br/>
&gt; they were to help insure whoever goes looking for the letterbox<br/>
&gt; actually has a good time.  That's the whole point, isn't it?  I like<br/>
&gt; to describe the trail--particularly how long or steep the trail is so<br/>
&gt; people know what they're getting into.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the Los Osos Oaks clues, I made a special note of the incredible<br/>
&gt; amounts of poison oak growing in the area.  It wasn't to help protect<br/>
&gt; me from getting sued, though.  I just wanted to make sure everyone<br/>
&gt; who went knew what they were getting into.  Some people are<br/>
&gt; hypersensitive to poison oak and probably wouldn't want to come<br/>
&gt; within a hundred feet of the stuff.  Others (like myself) who never<br/>
&gt; seem to get it even when we know we've touched the stuff don't really<br/>
&gt; care.  (Most probably fall somewhere in between, though.)  I want to<br/>
&gt; make sure people enjoy the hike, and the best way to help ensure they<br/>
&gt; do is to let them know what to expect before they even get there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I've started adding an extra warning about prodding with a stick or<br/>
&gt; using gloves before reaching into big, dark holes.  Not so much to<br/>
&gt; protect myself from being sued, but in the hopes whoever reads the<br/>
&gt; clues thinks, "Oh, that's a good idea!  Let me get the gloves before<br/>
&gt; I leave!"  Then, when they get there, they don't have to worry about<br/>
&gt; reaching a bare hand into the large, dark hole.  And perhaps make the<br/>
&gt; letterboxing experience that much better.  (Strangely, I forgot to<br/>
&gt; bring gloves for the last letterbox I found and resorted to swatting<br/>
&gt; around a stick in the hole before reaching in--but it still felt<br/>
&gt; wrong to reach in with bare hands.)  The warning wasn't to cover my<br/>
&gt; butt as much as it was to help make the letterboxing experience as<br/>
&gt; good as possible for the people who are searching for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The one and only thing I did to help "protect" myself is provide a<br/>
&gt; link to the waiver of responsibility and disclaimer on the LBNA<br/>
&gt; website.  I figured, (1) why not?, (2) it couldn't hurt, (3) it does<br/>
&gt; provide sound advice (know what you're doing!), and (4) the small<br/>
&gt; link isn't very intrusive on the page with the clues.  I don't really<br/>
&gt; expect it would stop anyone from suing me, but like I said before, it<br/>
&gt; doesn't hurt either.  *shrug*<br/>
