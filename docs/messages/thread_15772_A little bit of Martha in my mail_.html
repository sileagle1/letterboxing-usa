                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday was quite the day; so busy in fact that no one brought in the<br/>
mail.  Imagine my consternation when, on my way out early this moring, I<br/>
noticed my mailbox had been stendciled and painted with quite an elaborate<br/>
design.  Suspecting vandals, I looked closer and discovered the paint was<br/>
made from the flowers and other flora in the immediate vincinity of the box.<br/>
Rubbing my eyes, I also had to shake my head as I heard the soft strains of<br/>
classical music emanting from the newly decorated box.   Cautiously opening<br/>
the box, I found....Martha #2.<br/>
<br/>
I immediately helped her out of her temporary quarters, and after<br/>
accompanying me to Wal-Mart (an unsuccessful trip as everything I examined<br/>
was too too tacky according to Herself) Martha is now happily situated in my<br/>
lving room, crafting furniture out of the detrius of my stamp carvings.  She<br/>
is plannng on organizing my dust bunnies by size later today before retiring<br/>
to her snug mail-box guest house.  An elegant breakfast in the morn (she<br/>
assures me that frootloops and  Dr. Pepper can indeed be transformed into a<br/>
meal fit for royalty) and she will be moving on to the next needy soul.<br/>
<br/>
That is indeed a good thing.<br/>
