                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've recently visited my three Wisconsin boxes, Mount Bieterman, <br/>
Boyhood Adventures numbers 1 and 2, in the Milwaukee area. They are <br/>
all in good condition. They were all visited by the same four people, <br/>
Bob Marx, HBIII, Donna and Howard on 1 January, 2002. It appears that <br/>
they  all made it into a New Years Day party. Are there any other <br/>
letter boxers in SE Wisconsin?<br/>
<br/>
I've heard from the family of Coach Bieterman.  They were very pleased <br/>
that their brother and uncle had been so honored.<br/>
<br/>
I've also heard from someone who grew up across the creek from Boyhood <br/>
Adventures number 1.<br/>
