didn't understand the implications.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING:<br/>
PLEASE DO NOT search for my boxes if you intend to enter them into <br/>
ANY database. I don't want to pull boxes/clues because someone feels <br/>
they know better- I'm sharing myself with those who wish to play the <br/>
game the way it was intended. Don't ruin it for everyone because of <br/>
your own needs. I'D ABSOLUTELY LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU DIRECTLY-I've <br/>
met the nicest people that way! Enjoy! :o)<br/>
<br/>
What databases? and why would this be offensive? and what is <br/>
the "intended way" to play the game? What is it that is "ruining it <br/>
for everyone"?<br/>
<br/>
Being rather new to this I was dumbstruck by this. Have I <br/>
inadvertantly been doing something offensive and ruining it for <br/>
everyone? Are there letterboxing police out there somewhere?<br/>

many arguments about the pros and the cons, so here's a good point to<br/>
remember.....<br/>
<br/>
IF it's not your box, don't put it in any other database anywhere.  Only the<br/>
placer of a box should put the box in a database.<br/>
<br/>
Make any status reports to the owner of the box, either through the 'Contact<br/>
the Placer' at the main website, or via direct email if they put that in the<br/>
letterbox and or here, to this mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
Those simple guidelines should make everyone happy.<br/>

And, unless you have been adding boxes you found to a database elsewhere,<br/>
then you've not been doing anything wrong at all.<br/>

Just my humble 2 cents worth.<br/>

I've come across that warning about not listing someone's boxes in a <br/>
database before as well - but I've never looked for those boxes (not <br/>
in my area - they're too north of me).  When I do, I'll probably keep <br/>
it to myself.<br/>
