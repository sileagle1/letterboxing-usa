                    <div class="plaintext-content">During a very pleasant afternoon of letterboxing in John Bryan Park <br/>
in Ohio, we managed to double our 'F' count (from 11 to 23). Now I <br/>
was hoping to triple or quadruple it, but I had to settle for merely <br/>
doubling it.  My family elected to investigate a corn maze on our <br/>
second day that was closer to our hotel rather than return to the <br/>
park.  I must admit that we did have a wonderful time exploring the <br/>
maze.  As my kids say, this just gives a reason to return to the <br/>
park in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Just before our trip, the kids decided that they wanted their own <br/>
stamps.  So, each of them drew up their designs.  My son started to <br/>
carve his on his own, but decided to let me finish it up for him.  <br/>
Our stamping in takes a bit longer these days, but I will go along <br/>
with anything that keeps up their enthusiasm for this hobby!<br/>
