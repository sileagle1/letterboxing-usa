&gt;<br/>
&gt; One rule of thumb is to never click on e-mail attachments<br/>
&gt; unless you personally know the sender, _and_ expect them<br/>
&gt; to be sending you an attachment at the time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another rule of thumb is to not use Microsoft's e-mail<br/>
&gt; programs, such as Outlook and Outlook Express.  Moreover,<br/>
&gt; be wary of attachments when the _sender_ is using one<br/>
&gt; of these two programs, even if you know the sender<br/>
&gt; personally (the header fields of the e-mail often identify<br/>
&gt; the program they are using).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Neither is a substitute for anti-virus software, but both<br/>
&gt; can help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The list allows attachments because some people prefer<br/>
&gt; to send their clues out that way.  We can turn attachments<br/>
&gt; off if there is a groundswell of support for that notion,<br/>
&gt; but it seems out the the spirit of letterboxing to do so.<br/>
&gt; In letterboxing, there should be no presumption of clue<br/>
&gt; formatting, nor requirement that clues be plaintext as<br/>
&gt; opposed to attachments such as .doc files (though I'm sure<br/>
&gt; many would prefer this).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In these cases, the webmasters (I believe) sometimes convert<br/>
&gt; the clues to html, so the answer may be to simply wait until<br/>
&gt; that occurs if you wish to avoid clicking on the attachment.<br/>
&gt; I never click on attachments submitting to any mailing list,<br/>
&gt; even if they are presented as letterboxing clues.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As an aside, the list also provides a files upload/download<br/>
&gt; capability, which may be an alternative to sending large clue<br/>
&gt; attachments to everyone.<br/>

Thanks for the explanation. I noted that you apparently use outlook <br/>
express according to the headers in the infected message you sent me. <br/>
Please see Randy's note. Outlook and OE are probably the biggest <br/>
reason for the extent of the virus problems. You (and anyone else who <br/>
doesn't want to become "ill" and infect others with such a virus) <br/>
might consider another email client. Eudora is very powerful and runs <br/>
in a free and paid mode. Others are also available. Thanks again for <br/>
the letting us know you too were a victim (which is how these things <br/>
usually spread).<br/>

No problem with the virus on my end.The anti-virus software in my system <br/>
notified me of it and I deleted your post, so did not get to read it.I never <br/>
open attachments unless I know the person very well..please do not take that <br/>
presonally!<br/>
I'm glad you and your son enjoy 'boxing, we think it's great!<br/>
