<p>Kentucky Sweetbird Letterbox</p>
<p>Bardstown, KY</p>
<p>Nelson County</p>
<p>Planted by Deanne Bellefeuille-Besnia and David Besnia and Brother Gaetan</p>
<p>July 24, 2002</p>
<p>Clue difficulty: easy</p>
<p>Terrain: easy </p>
<p>This letterbox was planted on our first anniversary of letterboxing.</p>
<p>This is basically a drive-up letterbox. In very steamy weather and with our 
"going out to dinner" clothes on we decided to plant this on the last day of our 
Kentucky vacation. Locate the Bardstown/Nelson County Chamber of Commerce 
building in downtown Bardstown. Facing the building walk along the left side 
toward the parking area in the back. You will see a small rockwall to the left. 
Walk almost to the end of the wall and look for the loose rock that hides the 
Kentucky Sweetbird. If the Chamber of Commerce is open stop in and say hello to 
Kathy and Kim who, although they had never heard of letterboxing, were gracious 
enough to let us plant the box there. </p>
<p>We love to hear from anyone finding this box.</p>
