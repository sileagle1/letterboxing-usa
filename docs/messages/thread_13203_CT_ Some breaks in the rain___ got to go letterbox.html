                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally got to go on a serious hike after school on Tuesday!  I decided that <br/>
letterboxing was more important than going home and mowing the lawn!  (Of <br/>
course the lawn was REALLY long due to the large amounts of rain we have gotten <br/>
lately!)<br/>
<br/>
In order to make myself feel MORE guilty, I went and hiked Sleeping Giant!  I <br/>
was able to find the Chin, Tower, Sir Gawaine, The Sword In the Stone, <br/>
Merlin, and Right Hip LB's.  I also found some bonuses, The Green Knight and the <br/>
Time Flies HH.  It was great to find Time Flies at Merlin, since it was quite the <br/>
climb to get there!  OK..... because I felt guilty, I did go home and mow <br/>
lawn for over an hour..... when I came inside, I could not move!<br/>
<br/>
Today, I ventured out between the raindrops (literally!) and found Illinois <br/>
State Stamp, John Tom Hill, and Soaring Eagle.  I also was blessed with another <br/>
HH: The Lonely Goatherder.  Soaring Eagle had water in it, but the log and <br/>
stamp were fine.  I dried out the container as best as I could.  John Tom Hill <br/>
however, really needs a new and sturdier box.  The box and its overlying Ziploc <br/>
were both destroyed, however the contents were surprisingly dry due to double <br/>
bagging.  Of course, I used all of my ziplocs and spare boxes on other boxes <br/>
last weekend, so I didn't get to fix it.  :-(<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.... Since most of my students are out on a field trip tomorrow, and I <br/>
only have to work a few hours, maybe I'll get out again tomorrow and tackle <br/>
Somers, Enfield, and perhaps Windsor Locks..... <br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting everyone!<br/>
