Milo McIver Rubber Stamp Camp Out<br/>
Estacada, Oregon<br/>
July 11 - 13, 2003<br/>
<br/>
This is a reminder that the Portland Oregon area gathering will soon<br/>
take place at Milo McIver State Park in Estacada, Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be at Group Camp H2 and, per Funhog, the name it's under is<br/>
"Rubber Stamp Camp Out". We've got the group camp for Friday, July<br/>
11th from 4:00 pm that day to Sunday, July 13th at 1:00 pm, I<br/>
believe. This is a tent area that can take 25 campers. For those<br/>
not camping there is a Day Use Fee of, I believe $3.00. Campers can<br/>
just tell them at the booth that they are part of the Rubber Stamp Camp<br/>
Out at H2 and you shouldn't have to pay to get in at all.<br/>
<br/>
Events planned so far are Friday Night Potluck at 6:00 pm and into the<br/>
evening.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday the Paisley Orca will have a carving demo at 1:00pm.  <br/>
<br/>
There may be pinatas.  One for kids and one for adults, but this is just<br/>
a fantasy so far and not quite written in stone just yet.  My brother<br/>
suggested it since his kids love whacking papier mache at birthday<br/>
parties, apparently.  Also, anything else you can think of...We can have<br/>
a goody swap, if you would like, as well.  Bring erasers, or<br/>
letterboxing accessories to trade/giveaway.<br/>
<br/>
ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO DO SOMETHING OR HAS SUGGESTIONS, PLEASE LET ME<br/>
KNOW.  <br/>

MILO MCIVER STATE PARK GENERAL DRIVING DIRECTIONS FROM I-205 <br/>
<br/>
Take I-205.  <br/>
<br/>
Get off at the  OR-212 E/OR-224 E exit towards CLACKAMAS/ESTACADA.<br/>
<br/>
Turn RIGHT onto OR-224/OR-212 3.3 miles.<br/>
<br/>
Turn SLIGHT RIGHT onto OR-224 1.1 miles.<br/>
<br/>
Stay straight to go onto S SPRINGWATER RD. 9.5 miles.<br/>
<br/>
You're in the vicinity of the state park. Look for Milo McIver state<br/>
park shield or name on a sign along the roadway.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much.  I'm looking forward to a great time with those of you<br/>
who can make it.  Just feel free to show up!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
