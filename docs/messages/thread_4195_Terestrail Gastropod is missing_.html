list.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday i went out in search of the terretrial gastropod. I didnt have a<br/>
lot of luck finding the first box, went off to find the second box, and<br/>
while trying to locate the "trio of three, two snags and a tree" found the<br/>
first letterbox. Im sad to say that it was completly empty. All that is left<br/>
is the tupperware container and few very wet pieces of papper with nothing<br/>
left on them.<br/>
<br/>
I brought the box home as it was out in the open and i could find the<br/>
second. Beth and Mark, what would you like me to do with it? I would be mroe<br/>
then happy to return the box or put it back in its hiding place (if you can<br/>
tell me where that is!)<br/>
