does not mean that you have the trojan. what it does mean is that someone<br/>
who has your email address does<br/>
have the trojan. the way this trojan works is it steals the names from your<br/>
address book and then sends out. so if your name is in an address book that<br/>
is effected then your name will be used. the only way to be safe is to run a<br/>
virus scan. if you don't have an updated virus program there are free online<br/>
ones that work very well.<br/>

<br/>
  both of these programs will clean viruses, trojans, worms,and spyware<br/>
from your computer . they are not a substitute for a good virus program as<br/>
they only detect and clean not prevent.<br/>
<br/>
your best bet is not to open any mail that thas the subject line "new<br/>
graphics site" or a varation thereof.<br/>
