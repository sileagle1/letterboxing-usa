I wanted to see if you are still making a box for the Mansfield Monster Mash. If so, what is the monster? and do you know all the details about making a box for us. The info can be found at the Mansfield Monster Mash website http://www.chuckstraub.com/Letterboxing/mmm.htm under the Monster Makers and their creations page. Please let me know off site if you are still interested ....Chuck and Molly<br/>
