Bluebird, Letterboxer2002, and I ventured out at 7:30 a.m. on Saturday to find <br/>
Dragon's Fire Letterbox in fine form, with a hitchhiker to boot!  Happily, we <br/>
found the Shooting Star Hitchhiker (?  I forgot to write it down), which <br/>
Butterfly will send on its way soon.  We then ventured to find Otewah Campground, <br/>
Fritz' Letterbox, and Granny Austin's Tavern all in fine form.<br/>
<br/>
Then we ventured out to the Relay for Life, where I was happy to finally meet <br/>
Steve, Heidi and Madras!  The rain started pouring as soon as the Relay for <br/>
Life started, however it didn't dampen any spirits!  Teach and Preach blessed <br/>
us with the Joe Schmoe's Geography Hitchhiker!  Unfortunately, I had to leave <br/>
to go to Jonathan Edwards Winery for a wine party, so that is all that happened <br/>
on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday proved to be much more fruitful for boxing!  I found all of the <br/>
following boxes in good shape:<br/>
<br/>
Bee Happy<br/>
Go Batty<br/>
Big Rock (yes, I forgot to do the new boxes on the pink loop.... that's what <br/>
happens   <br/>
       when I'm not paying close enough attention!)<br/>
Synderella<br/>
Dragon of Krakow<br/>
2 years-2000 boxes<br/>
Teapot<br/>
Teacup<br/>
Cream and Sugar<br/>
Sassafras (spelling?????)<br/>
Rogers Lake<br/>
St. Matthias<br/>
Milo Light<br/>
Milo Light II<br/>
Butterfly's Anniversary<br/>
Lakeshore<br/>
<br/>
If you recognize some of the above boxes and wonder why I didn't get the <br/>
whole series, there were too many people at most of the spots, and Grassy Hill was <br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it was a great day!  Hope I can go out tomorrow after school and find <br/>
more!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
