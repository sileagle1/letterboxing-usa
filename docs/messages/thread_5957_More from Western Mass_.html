<br/>Another successful day of letterboxing. Getting an early start, we visited This Little Pig in Amherst, MA first. Quick and direct, a good way to start the day. The box is in excellent shape, but no more little piggy souvenirs left for us. After stamping in, we drove off to North Mount Sugarloaf in South Deerfield, MA. A great day for a good hike, and the high humidity actually helped keep the bugs down. The clue warns you about poorly marked trails, and it ain't kidding. We overcame that problem, and found the box in perfect condition. Â After enjoying the spectacular views of the Connecticut River Valley below, we hiked back down.
<br/>
<br/>Once returning to the car, we jetted off back to Amherst, and found the Mt. Pollux letterbox. This one has seen a good number of visitors, and is great for kids. Beware of poison ivy if you try for this one, it's all over the place! 
<br/>
<br/>Our last stop of the day was the Tortoise, also in Amherst, MA. A nice walk over mostly level terrain to end the day. 
<br/>
<br/>How many of you on this list are in Western Mass/Northern CT? There must be a lot to explain the incredible amount of boxes in this area.

But when you're done with all of the boxes up here, take a look at<br/>
Connecticut!  Those CT-ers have us beat by a mile, in terms of number of boxes<br/>
around ;)<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>We're already making plans to add to the boxes in Western Mass. There are way to many parks around here that need multiple letterboxes. I'm hatching a plan for a long series of boxes, all in Western Mass. I'm also thinking that a new box celebrating the announcement this week that Mt. Tom will be protected by both the state and the Trustees of the Reservations from future developement would be a cool idea. Mt Tom is too big to only have one box on it, and there are no boxes out in the Westfield River basin, which is where we do most of our hiking. I think that, before the summer is over, we'll have a number after that 'P' in our sig.
