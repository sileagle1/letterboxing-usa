<br/>
Rock Crick #2 was alive &amp; well with numerous visitors<br/>
-we were unable to find Rock Crick #1<br/>
<br/>
Drew Clan's Kid Gloves Series:<br/>
-couldn't find #1, the creek side beech tree has been reduced to a 4' <br/>
recently hollowed stump and the 'destination tree at 11 o'clock' was <br/>
uprooted, the box is possibly embedded in the mud around the <br/>
devastation zone?<br/>
-#2 &amp; #3 were both alive and well<br/>
<br/>
Kid Gloves Redux (Trish's) was alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
Panda LB was alive &amp; well and begging for visitors &amp; bamboo<br/>
<br/>
The Inventor was alive &amp; well &amp; one of my all time favorite stamps!!!<br/>
<br/>
Skull &amp; Bones has unfortunately vanished<br/>
<br/>
Yet, another interesting day in the District of Columbia visiting <br/>
spots we otherwise might never have known about had we not been led <br/>
there via letterboxing.  Thanks for placing such neat &amp; interesting <br/>
letterboxes around here!!!  See you along the trails...<br/>
