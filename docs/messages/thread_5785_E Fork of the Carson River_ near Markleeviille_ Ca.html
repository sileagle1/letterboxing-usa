<div>20 year Anniversary box.  There are several 
ways to reach the letterbox:  4 wheel drive, hike or a white water 
raft/kayak trip.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The East Fork of the Carson is a great spring time 
white water trip for beginners and family 
groups.  The run starts near Hangman's 
Bridge in Markleeville, Ca and ends up 19 miles 
later near Gardnerville, Nevada. The river has a fairly steep gradient even 
though its rapids are rated Class II and can be boated in one day.  We 
typically have several lay over days early on as the upper section has beautiful 
alpine vistas.  Catch and release fishing affords many opportunities for 
anglers.  There is a large camping area starting at mile 7.8 on river right 
and at mile 7.9  on river right there is a porta potty, picnic bench and 
some signage that indicates that the area has been adopted by the Fiddle Footed 
4 wheelers from Santa Clara who drive in on the 4 wheel dirt road through 
Cottonwood Canyon.  There are several hot 
springs on river right and left, just down river from this popular camping area and more about 1/4 mile on river 
left past the Class III rapid called Sidewinder.  The run is 
spring time, May-June and into early July on wet years but the water is cold.and 
with the start of the run at 5200 feet air temps during the night can get to 
down to freezing.  Bring warm clothes. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To find the  E. Carson Letter Box 
which lies within sight of the river right hot 
springs just past Cottonwood Creek start at mile 
7.9  just down river from the picnic 
table/portapotty camping area, then a short walk around the bend to a smaller camping area where you will see a Class II 
rapid,  Cross Cottonwood Creek and from 
there it will be about 70 paces to a pine tree on the right side of the 
trail.  The pine forks about half way up.  
The letter box is located at the base of the forked pine (on the side closest to the river) </div>
<div>tucked under the roots of the tree and hidden 
by movable rocks.  If you pass by the natural hot springs stop and return 
up river 36 paces to the forked pine tree on the up hill side of the 
trail.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To hike in check Topo maps of the area.  Call 
Carson River Resort or The Chamber of Commerce in Markleeville for specifics on the 4X4 road.  Other attractions in the 
area are Grover Hot Springs.</div></body></html>
