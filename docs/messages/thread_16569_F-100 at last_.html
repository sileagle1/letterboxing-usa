                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we made a lengthly road trip today down to Scoutdogs corner<br/>
of Ohio today. We needed 10 boxes to get 100 finds. Started in Glen <br/>
Haven<br/>
cemetery and found all 4 of those with no problem. Beautiful day,<br/>
beautiful cemetery, beautiful stamps, well hidden, and in good<br/>
condition. Then, after a bite of lunch, off to Miami Whitewater in <br/>
search of the<br/>
long coveted Harry Potter series. We figured those 4 boxes plus<br/>
Franzsolo's Badlands Trail box and Mad Dawg's Purple Mountain Majesty<br/>
box would get us to the magic 100. Found the first Potter box with no<br/>
problem. Unfortunately, despite CardinalMom's looking under every<br/>
leaf within 50 yards of what we took to be the right stump, we failed<br/>
to find Diagon Alley. We found the others ok - Sorting Hat is a<br/>
little damp as is Purple Mountain Majesty which also needs a new<br/>
logbook - but with clouds rolling in, Trail Buddy about at the end of<br/>
his patience, and 150 miles to drive home we despaired of getting the<br/>
magic 100 today. We took one more look at the clues we had brought<br/>
and realized The Colorful Castle was within a stone's throw of our<br/>
van. We quickly stamped in as rain drops began to fall and returned<br/>
home tired but happy. Once home, we were happily surprised to find<br/>
Scoutdog's Snail Mail postal letterbox waiting in the mailbox! And<br/>
it had a hitchhiker with it! So we finished the day at F-102. Great<br/>
day! Thank you all for the great boxes and beautiful stamps. Hope<br/>
you all had a great day too.<br/>
