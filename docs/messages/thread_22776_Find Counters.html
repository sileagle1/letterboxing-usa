Not accurate for who?  It is [still] completely accurate for the way <br/>
many people play the game.  Just because there is another way to do <br/>
it that may be more techie or more up-to-date, doesn't mean that the <br/>

letterboxing in the UK -- just because computers and web sites are <br/>
readily acessible and "fun," they have remained true to their style <br/>
of play and continue to distribute clues in a printed clue book.  <br/>

Why dont we all purchase one of those hand held devices that the grocery stores use to keep inventory  you know, the ones that scan the products on the shelves? Then we can have all placers paste UPC codes on the bottom of each of their letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
When were walking in the woods, all we have to do is wave that electronic magic wand in the area we THINK the letterbox is hidden and it will automatically find it for us AND record the find in a letterbox in a specially devised software program sold by Letterboxing.org. We won't even get our hands dirty or have to deal with yuckky snakes or worry about closing the containers or zip lock bags. <br/>
<br/>
Just wave and go!<br/>

Great idea?<br/>

I don't understand why you say "I don't get it". <br/>

<br/>
The changes to the site have been made and you're not<br/>
happy. But you don't have to use those features. We<br/>
all have options. I applaud the webmasters for taking<br/>
into account the whole community of letterboxers and<br/>
adapting the site as web features become available and<br/>
as the game grows. The game has evolved quite a bit<br/>

new features, and your angry at me for suggesting that<br/>
others know about it.<br/>

you can even call it letterboxing if you wish...  but that doesn't <br/>

view different than yours, you shouldn't have asked the question.<br/>

<br/>
If you wish to count *your* letterboxes electronically, digitally, by <br/>
abacus or bar code scanner or by any other method....on a website, <br/>
off a website, wherever...by all means, do so. <br/>
<br/>
It would be incredibly respectful of you if you would indulge others <br/>
who count..or not...as they wish. Perhaps geocaching fills your needs <br/>
better than letterboxing and you would be happier touting that site's <br/>
features to a more interested audience.<br/>
<br/>
In the grand scheme of letterboxing, what difference does it make if <br/>
someone uses an optional website feature or not and why do you have <br/>
to continue to impose your desire for folk to use these features? <br/>
You've made your point. Please get this. <br/>

to go back to <br/>
the way it was -- no logging features, etc.  I was<br/>
simply giving you <br/>
my answer to that question.  If you didn't want to<br/>
hear points of <br/>
view different than yours, you shouldn't have asked<br/>
the question.<br/>

Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but I'm unsure why you need to <br/>

If you don't like how something's done, change how YOU do it to suit <br/>

I don't understand why one would bother with the last finder feature<br/>
or what ever it is. Why on earth would you accept the opinion of the<br/>
masses that a box is missing? There are a lot of boxers who just<br/>
aren't up to finding some boxes. Many of us have gotten the e-mail<br/>
that says "...I KNOW for a FACT that I was in the right spot and it<br/>
wasn't there" I have to avoid asking the obvious question of how they<br/>
could know it "for a fact" since they weren't with me when I placed<br/>
it, but stupid people often ask stupid questions. What about the bad<br/>
placers too. Haven't we all had the experience of figuring out that<br/>
someone read their compass wrong, wrote left when they meant right.<br/>
Seems to me it would be a lot bigger boost to your ego finding a box<br/>
no one else could find than the hollow prize of logging into a box<br/>
that requires no thought what so ever. Life's a little richer when you<br/>
try a little harder.<br/>

Yes, this thread has prompted me to reconsider how my boxes are listed <br/>
also.  I have always had the status disabled because I think it <br/>
detracts from the intrigue of the box to have a log of who was there <br/>
(and when) before you.  I am now at the point of seriously considering <br/>
completely removing all of my boxes from both LbNA and AtlasQuest and <br/>
just leaving the clues posted on my personal web site.<br/>
<br/>
If this means less people look for them, so it is.  The clues are out <br/>
there, available to anyone who cares to venture to my web site for <br/>
them.  As I see it, there are a couple of other positives about this -- <br/>
I feel like I am encouraging another aspect of the game that many do <br/>
not understand or appreciate -- the hunt for the clues themselves, and <br/>
also I suspect that although the boxes may see fewer overall visitors, <br/>
those who do bother to hunt down the clues will tend to be more serious <br/>
and seasoned letterboxers, which seems to directly correlate to fewer <br/>
missing boxes.<br/>

times.<br/>
<br/>
Don't assume that just because someone doesn't contact you in return, that<br/>
that person has "dropped the sport of letterboxing like trash."<br/>
<br/>
1.  If the person contacts you back, the contacter then has their email<br/>
address.  Some placers don't necessarily want others to have their email<br/>
address, especially if they don't know/recognize the contacter.  Some people<br/>
don't have a variety of email addresses and don't want to go thru the bother<br/>
of setting up "throwaway email addys."  If someone has a certain trailname<br/>
as a finder, they might place boxes under an entirely different name.  Some<br/>
people use several different names for both finding and planting.   They<br/>
might cherish that anonymity.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Some folks believe that once a box is out there, it's out there.  They<br/>
have no desire to ever be contacted.  I try to email each person who<br/>
contacts me, even if I don't really want to, :-), but I don't expect that in<br/>
return.  I just had one person email me asking when two of the boxes that<br/>
I'd temporarily taken out of service for maintenance work would be back.<br/>
And it wasn't a polite asking.  It was written as a demand that it was my<br/>
"duty" to get my boxes back out there.  That was actually the straw that<br/>
broke the camel's back, and now all of my boxes are off LbNA.  They can<br/>
still contact me since they didn't use LbNA in the first place to contact<br/>
me -- they already had my email address.  But that was the second time in<br/>
one week that someone has gotten grumpy about my boxes not being available<br/>
right when they want them to be available. Sorry.  Letterboxing is<br/>
definitely a small sideline.  It isn't my life.<br/>
<br/>
3.  People have lives outside of letterboxing.  They could be dealing with a<br/>
family crisis, they could be suddenly working 80 hours a week, they could be<br/>
on an extended vacation, the doctor could have just told them they have<br/>
cancer, they might have lost their job and have been concentrating on<br/>
finding a new one, etc.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Many people don't even check their email but once a month or so.<br/>
<br/>
5.  The placer's computer might be down so they're offline for now.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is -- if you have a question about a box and it's not answered,<br/>
don't go searching for any more of their boxes if that lack of an answer<br/>
isn't to your liking.  We recently went looking for a box placed by someone<br/>
we've never heard of before because it was located really close so there<br/>
wasn't much cost in gasoline.  They only have that one box listed on LbNA.<br/>
We couldn't find it.  We emailed them to let them know.  If we don't hear<br/>
back, we might go looking for future boxes if they place any.  We might not.<br/>
I'm not doing much of any "finding" right now anyway until the gas prices<br/>
come down a bit more.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what it comes down to for me is that I really don't feel that any<br/>
placer "owes" any searcher anything.  I have things that I might gripe<br/>
about.  Like I wish that placers would mention it in the clues if the stamp<br/>
is store-bought.  Do I think they "owe" that to me tho?  Nope.  I might<br/>
grumble under my breath when they don't.  But I don't feel it's "an issue to<br/>
address" as far as the website is concerned.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the fact that if a placer placed a box, they should take care of<br/>
it......sez who?  A lot of people plant boxes along a vacation route or they<br/>
place boxes and then move a couple of states away a few months later.  They<br/>
might return to an area once or twice a year or possible never again.   They<br/>
might find someone locally who would be willing to maintain the box.  They<br/>
might not be able to find someone.  They might not even *try* to find<br/>
someone to help maintain it.  It might be nice if they did, but there's no<br/>
obligation there.<br/>
<br/>
Place your own boxes and take care of them exactly how you wish to take care<br/>
of them.  That's pretty much the only thing each letterboxer has any control<br/>
over in their letterboxing life.  Other than that, it becomes a case of that<br/>
old saying "don't sweat the small stuff and it's all small stuff."<br/>

<br/>
i find it is so hard to first contact the placer...... then find it<br/>
even harder to wait days for a response, if you ever get one. i like<br/>
the idea, for it could be used in many ways. lets worry about the<br/>
placer issue first...... ive been waiting 3 weeks to hear back from<br/>
a placer and i am just a bit bothered by people who pick up the<br/>
sport of letterboxing and drop it like trash on the ground. you<br/>
place a box, you should take care of it. i have 4 boxes right now,<br/>
and im glued to my computer like stick on poop, for any emails about<br/>
my boxes..... sorry if i seem upset.....<br/>

You're correct. I just checked into the option for disabling your status and<br/>
it doesn't remove people's ability to mark one of your boxes as found but it<br/>
hides all status info from people viewing your box's clue page. So, if you<br/>
don't want people to be influenced by seeing the the most recent status was<br/>
attempted, then this option works. The purpose in allowing finders to mark<br/>
one of your boxes as found so that it can be hidden on the search results.<br/>
<br/>
There is a separate preference to disable e-mail for finders when they set<br/>
your status.<br/>
