<br/>
We're going to be between Nantucket, MA and Woodstock, VT (including Boston) <br/>
Sept 14-21. Would like advice on letterboxes you might recommend to us in <br/>
these vicinities. Since we have scheduled places to go and people to see, long <br/>
hikes, much as we'd like to, are not possible so drive-bys and short jaunts are <br/>
preferred. <br/>
<br/>
Exchanges are also sought after! Anyone game?<br/>

There are 5 boxes in Bird Park in Walpole, MA that are all VERY easy <br/>
to get to.  I have listed them below. Bird park is about 5 minutes <br/>
off exits 9 or 10 on I-95 in Mass. <br/>
<br/>
Lb's in Bird:<br/>
Happy Birthday, Baby! planted by Amy &amp; Jay<br/>
Weeping Willow planted by Dragonfly<br/>
Crows at Bird Park planted by Dragonfly<br/>
Cheeseburger Challenge planted Music Man<br/>
Spring Leaf planted by The Family from Mass (us)<br/>
<br/>
You can probably do all of these in a little over an hour. Here are <br/>
some links for Bird Park.<br/>

http://www.walpole.ma.us/efranciswilliam.htm <br/>
<br/>
As for exchanges... One idea might be to post a date and time you'll <br/>
try to be there, and see who shows up to meet you at the park. I'd be <br/>
there!  Otherwise feel free to email me off list to arrange an <br/>
exchange.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As dave and diane wrote, the Quechee Gorge LB's are nice. They are<br/>
moderately easy hikes. Each LB takes about 20-30 mins to find. The<br/>
Ottauquechee River Bridge one has the best reward (view wise) but a<br/>
pretty difficult climb back up. The Quechee Gorge one is a little<br/>
easier overall.<br/>
<br/>
You'll drive over Quechee Gorge on the way to Woodstock.<br/>
<br/>
Also in Quechee is the Fat Hat Quest. Short hike up a steep hill.<br/>
If you've gone up 10 minutes, you've gone too far. We did!<br/>
<br/>
Super easy one (a drive-by) is Vermont Loon in Hartford, VT. It's in<br/>
a rest stop off Rt 91 North.<br/>
<br/>
If you can get to Brownsville VT (maybe 10 miles southwest of<br/>
Woodstock) the Brownsville Cemetary one is 10-15 minutes top, hunting<br/>
through a graveyard. With a beautiful beautiful view. You really<br/>
shouldn't miss this one, the view is spectacular. Brownsville<br/>
Lighthouse, across the street, is longer, maybe 1 hour round trip.<br/>
Another easy cemetary one in Brownsville is Vermont Bug.<br/>
<br/>
There are several in Woodstock proper. History Mystery Barrel Quest,<br/>
the Forest Quest,FPQ Quest (fabulous and quick cemetary quest) are<br/>
all Valley Quest II quests, but I think you have to buy the book<br/>
(available locally, we got ours at Montshire Museum). Note if you<br/>
know the area and consult maps, you can shorten these considerably.<br/>
But if you follow them from the town green (as instructed) they'll<br/>
take a long time.<br/>
<br/>
An easy one in Hartford, VT (which is the town Quechee is part of)<br/>
is "The Maple<br/>
Quest" at Sugarbush Farm. 10 minutes tops. Also, see "Center of<br/>
Town Valley Quest" (pretty much a drive by) and Jericho Historic<br/>
Quest (drive by-ish and gorgeous). All in Valley Quest II.<br/>
<br/>
In Massachusetts, the newly placed Night Song letterbox is right off<br/>
Rt 128 north at the Rt. 9 east exit. You'd take exit, take first<br/>
right onto Quinnibeacon (?sp), take R at light onto Central, parking<br/>
lot is after plaza on R (less than 1/4 mile). It's maybe 20 minutes<br/>
and it's a mini gorge so you can practice for Quechee.<br/>
<br/>
This is all I have right now. We're new to LBing and started on our<br/>
annual Quechee vacation, hence the skewing toward there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
