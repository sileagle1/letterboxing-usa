I do not know what 'number' the Healing Staff was for me when I found <br/>
it, but it was and is a wonderful story and puts one in such a quiet <br/>
place. I must tell you all that letterboxing is in truth a healing <br/>
hobby. The Nature Preserves and Forrests that the thoughtful clues take <br/>
us to in the search, are in themselves a healing place. Please know that <br/>
the faces of letterboxing friends in time of sorrow have brightened up <br/>
my heart. and uplifted my soul. Thank you all for giving me that <br/>
precious gift of a caring friend.  Very soon, I promise this butterfly <br/>
will be flying into the woods again with a light and happy heart amoung <br/>
friends.<br/>
