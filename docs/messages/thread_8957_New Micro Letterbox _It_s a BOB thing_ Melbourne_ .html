<br/>
The "It's a BOB thing" letterbox was created to mark my father's 75th <br/>
birthday.  My brother's and our families had gather to celebrate this <br/>
milestone in Melbourne and after explaining Letterboxing and finding <br/>
no letterbox near by, we decided to create one.  The art is from one <br/>
brother, the stamp carving is by another. The Grand children did the <br/>
hiding.<br/>
<br/>
This is a MICRO letterbox so please bring your own stamp pad.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: <br/>
The letterbox is located at the intersection of Rt. 192 and the <br/>
Indian River (intercostal), on the Western shore at the Claude Edge <br/>
Front Street Park. Beyond the boat launch you'll find a lovely garden <br/>
by the house where girls meet. Follow one of the paths to the waters <br/>
edge and look for a water fountain. It is there you will find what <br/>
you seek.<br/>
