                    <div class="plaintext-content">you can add to a series if you're listing them at atlas quest.  but you can only add them on to the end of the series, so if you want to lead them on a certain route through town if they are getting the entire series in one day, then start planting at the beginning of that route, then plant and add them in order along the route.<br/>

I don't know about adding to a series at lbna...all my clues over there are just links to aq, where they are hosted.<br/>
