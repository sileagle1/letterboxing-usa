                    <div class="plaintext-content">We start this trail day with our two teams of oxen Scooby and Shaggy <br/>
and Zeke and Shin. We our following our ancestors  path from <br/>
Killingly to their new farm in Mansfield the year is 1772. Were there <br/>
maps and road signs then. There were few folks to ask directions of. <br/>
We are impressed by our ancestors strength in making this trip in <br/>
those times.  Take out your wonderful full color map and look for <br/>
Goodwin Forest in  Hampton , Ct.  From Rte 6 drive in Potter Rd. Into <br/>
the park and up the road you will find the trail intersection.  Head <br/>
off on the left trail after an mile imagining us with oxen you will <br/>
come to a little bridge and brook, we watered here. You are under Rte <br/>
6. Go a little further up the trail are your feet tired . We stopped <br/>
for lunch under a wooden trestle bridge . Cool and shady the oxen <br/>
chewed their cud and relaxed snitching a green leaf here or there. We <br/>
drank water had sandwiches , packed our litter and left hoofprints <br/>
from 1772 behind the second upright on the right under rock. Please <br/>
rehide the same. Our oxen are barefoot but in 1772 under the rough <br/>
conditions a blacksmith would have been hired to fit shoes to the <br/>
feet of oxen to protect them for the long journey. These trails are <br/>
well groomed and easy on feet hope your feet enjoy the journey.  <br/>
