THE GLASS WORKS LETTERBOX: Sagamore, MA (Barnstable County)<br/>
<br/>
Placed on October 19, 2002 by The Yachtsman and Mary Manatee<br/>
<br/>
This Letterbox was placed near the home of The Pairpoint Glassworks, a <br/>
small factory that produces a number of unique hand-blown crystal <br/>
glassware pieces along the Cape Cod Canal in Sagamore, MA.  The <br/>
history of this company dates back to 1837 when the Mount Washington <br/>
Glass Works was founded in South Boston.  The firm was moved to New <br/>
Bedford in 1870 by William L. Libbey.  Later, Frederick S. Shirley led <br/>
the company to a time of excellence when it was awarded a certificate <br/>
of merit for an exhibit at the Centennial Exposition in Philadephia in <br/>
1876.  In 1880, the Pairpoint Manufacturing Company was built on land <br/>
next to the Mount Wahington Glass Company.  Its works were named for <br/>
its first superintendent, Thomas J. Pairpoint, who was considered one <br/>
of the greatest silver designers in England and America.  In 1894, the <br/>
two companies merged were henceforth known as the Pairpoint <br/>
Corporation.  From that time on, the combined company became a leader <br/>
in the glass industry.  The current factor has been active on Cape Cod <br/>
since 1970.  They make hand-blown crystal, including stemware, <br/>
decanters, perfume bottles, pitchers, and many other decorative items. <br/>
 Since 1974 Pairpoint has also been making "cup plates" with new and <br/>
original designs, of which there are now more than 100 on the market!<br/>
<br/>
The glassblowers at Paipoint may be seen working Monday through <br/>
Friday, and there is a gift shop on site.  The company provides <br/>
glassware for such illustrious clients as Tiffany's, The Metropolitan <br/>
Museum of Art, The Boston Museum of Fine Arts and others.  Colored <br/>
glasses include various shades of blue, ruby, opal, amethys, amber and <br/>
Pairpoint cranberry.  More information can be found on the Pairpoint <br/>
Glassworks website at www.pairpoint.com.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Cross over the Bourne Bridge, and go 3/4 of the way around <br/>
the rotary in Bourne to Route 6A east (towards Sagamore and Sandwich). <br/>
Go straight through the traffic light at the intersection with Route <br/>
6 east, passing under the Sagamore Bridge, and passing some white <br/>
apartment buildings on your right (south) side.  Park in the parking <br/>
lot on the north side of Route 6A in Sagamore next to the baseball <br/>
field.  (If that lot is full, you can also park in the Sagamore post <br/>
office lot when they are closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays.  <br/>
Regardless of where you park, take the path next to the post office <br/>
which takes you to the railroad tracks used by the Cape Cod Scenic <br/>
Railway.  Cross the tracks (with care), and pass through the short <br/>
patch of brush on the other side to the Cape Cod Canal access path.<br/>
<br/>
Turn to the east, and pass 4 relatively new houses on your right.  <br/>
Soon you will see a large concrete buttress on the south side of the <br/>
tracks that is the remnant of the foundation for a drawbridge that was <br/>
one of two bridges that spanned the canal during its earliest years.  <br/>
Just before drawing even with the concrete buttress, you will see a <br/>
white fence at a drainage ditch on the right side of the path.  There <br/>
is a survey marker in front of the fence.  If you stand with your back <br/>
to the marker, you will see a large tree at 60o.  Your treasure lies <br/>
under that tree, hidden by a rock and some sticks.  Please hide it <br/>
again carefully after stamping in, as this area is heavily used by <br/>
fishermen and other visitors.<br/>
