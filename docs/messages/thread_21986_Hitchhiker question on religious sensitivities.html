There are about 6 or 7 stamps in it's logbook, and the only actual comment<br/>
written down so far is from couple of boxers who seemed offended by the<br/>
hitchhiker.  Frankly, we were also offended by the hitchhiker.  And as such,<br/>

I'm part of a very small minority, or am I greatly risking offending other<br/>

left their info with the hitchhiker, so what I'd really like to do is just<br/>
mail it back to them with a note to put it into another box themselves if<br/>
they so desire. :-) But that might not be fair, since the hitchhiker might<br/>
only offend 0.1% of the letterboxing community, if that much.  I don't know.<br/>

Should this even be a concern, or should I just put the hitchhiker into<br/>

Now of course this is just my personal opinion, and as in life there will<br/>
always be differences of opinion and in faith.  So be it.  If this HH was<br/>
personally offensive to me (and I say this with no knowledge whatsoever of<br/>
this HH), I would have just left it there, neither stamping in or<br/>
commenting.  Perhaps the next Boxer that comes along to find it will feel<br/>
differently. It's not a right/wrong thing.  If I understand your post<br/>

<br/>
If it's an "ours is the only true path" kind of stamp, I usually sigh<br/>
and figure that someone else will be as happy to find it as I am<br/>
exasperated by what seems a misguided effort.  I usually don't stamp<br/>
in my own logbook if the theme irritates me at all.<br/>
<br/>
If it's something discriminatory, that's a different story.  But, I've<br/>
never seen a stamp like that.<br/>
<br/>
At gatherings and on the trail, I've seen stamps and heard (and read)<br/>
comments by people who mean well and seem not to realize that--just<br/>
like politics--not everyone agrees with them about religious beliefs<br/>
and practices.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it's a good idea to simply place the HH with another box,<br/>
without feeling obliged to participate in other ways.  The next person<br/>
who finds the stamp may very well say, "Oh look!  Someone like me!"<br/>
and be thrilled with it.<br/>
<br/>
There's room for all of us in this fabulous hobby.  At worst, I've<br/>
seen a few insensitive stamps, but as long as a stamp is not<br/>
mean-spirited, I see every stamp and letterbox as that person's right<br/>
to free expression.<br/>

That makes a lot of sense to me.  I don't like to see us become a nation <br/>
of intolerant people, and we have more of a tendency to do that today.   <br/>
LBing is a great way for us all to stay connected in a healthy way, not <br/>
judge each other in a society that is sometimes not so healthy and is <br/>
full of judgmental practices.  Anne and I are new to the game and love it.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you all<br/>

&gt; That makes a lot of sense to me. I don't like to see us become a nation <br/>

&gt; LBing is a great way for us all to stay connected in a healthy way, not <br/>

If the boxes that offended you had religious themed clues in them and <br/>
you did not wish to seek out religious themed boxes, why didn't you just <br/>
skip over them and move on to the next set of clues? If I am reading <br/>
clues for a box and the clues seem to be related to a theme I don't care <br/>
to seek out, I just skip past those particular boxes and move on to the <br/>
next. There are so many different boxes out there, it would seem that <br/>
the diversity would be a GOOD thing because sooner or later we all find <br/>
treasures. With so many different tastes out there, I would only <br/>
naturally assume that not all boxes would appeal to me but that even <br/>
though a certain type of box wouldn't appeal to me, there will be others <br/>
who would be thrilled to have it. For the most part, the clues alone <br/>
give me an idea as to whether or not I wish to seek out a box. If it <br/>
doesn't appeal, just move on.<br/>

<br/>
I'm grateful for all those people who have come in and out of my entire life who have exposed me to new ideas and differing points of view. Some I have incorporated into my own thinking and others I have not.  But if keeping everything private were the prevailing MO, I would have missed out on not only a lot of interesting aspects of life, but a lot of interesting people, too. <br/>
<br/>
We can't pick and choose what parts of a person we become acquainted with - each person is a whole person made up of many parts - I don't expect I will ever find anyone who is my exact duplicate in my thinking and beliefs and I don't expect people to look that way at me - I hope I can accept what is another person's essence just as much as they can accept me for being me - <br/>
if I find I don't agree with what is important to someone else, then so be it..........that's life..........<br/>
I'm not offended by someone letting me know who they are, no matter what part of life I may encounter them in - professional, private, hobbies, etc..........how I react or respond is my choice...............and I try to respond in the same way I would want someone to respond to me - at the very least, with mutual respect.....................<br/>
<br/>
if we have to stop and think about what might offend someone (again barring intended hatefilled offenses)before we make up a box (or HH) to place, then we might as well stop altogether.................we're no longer enjoying this hobby................and the people we meet in it....................<br/>

Roman Catholic cemeteries have a "dress code" of sorts, which I'd also have<br/>

wants to put out an Islam oriented box, etc., I think that would be an<br/>
interesting "set" of stamps to collect.  A "series" of a sort.  And if<br/>
someone feels the box is offensive, they can skip right on over it.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, HHs are a bit different.  They don't come with clues.<br/>
And they're just thrown willy-nilly from box to box.  It reminds me of the<br/>
Christian denominations whose people go door to door, whether homeowners are<br/>
welcoming to them or not. But there too, in those instances, if a person<br/>
sees them coming up the sidewalk, they can choose not to answer the door.<br/>
<br/>
This HH isn't a "hate" type of religious HH.  It's an evangelizing HH.  It's<br/>
a very cheap store-bought stamp with a logbook made of index cards cut into<br/>
quarters and held together with a clip.  Then there's a business card<br/>
advertising the group, with telephone numbers, email addy, street addy, etc.<br/>
for anyone who might be interested, and the logbook has a few bible passages<br/>
of importance to this particular denomination.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, to me, it's the "choice" angle.  I can choose whether or not to go<br/>
looking for a religious themed letterbox.  I can't choose whether or not a<br/>
religious themed HH is going to end up in one of *my* letterboxes or adopted<br/>
letterboxes.  And that's why I'm uncomfortable taking it and putting it into<br/>
someone *else's* letterbox.  I didn't appreciate it showing up in my<br/>
(adopted) box, and the next person might or might not care for it ending up<br/>
in one of *their* boxes.  But I wouldn't be giving them the choice on<br/>
whether or not their letterbox was going to become a temporary "evangelizing<br/>
letterbox". I suppose I could email them first and say "Hey, guess who wants<br/>
to come to dinner?"  And if they're one of those placers who don't believe<br/>
in responding when contacted, welllllll, that's not *my* fault, now is it?<br/>

I was pleased to hear that others are offended by the religious themed<br/>
boxes. I was very offended by a series in DE that were religious<br/>
themed boxes with religious themed clues. I'm sure they were planted<br/>
by someone who "meant well" and is filled with such religious ecstasy<br/>
that they just wanted to share something that brings them great joy<br/>
with others but there is a very fine line that is easily crossed here.<br/>

This country was founded on "freedom of religion" not hiding our religion.  The whole point of this country is being able to worship how you choose without having to hide it for fear of persecution.  Worship does not just happen on Sunday or Saturday, or whatever day is your particular holy day.  I don't think it is necessary for someone to keep something that is such a huge part of the person they are to themselves.  Now hearing that this in an evangalizing box, I am not sure how I feel about that, maybe not so good, cause I don't like feeling pressured by the people that come to my door.  I think that said I would probably send it back with the explanation of the box being retired.  I think a box planted that has a religious theme would be fine, so long as you were given an idea of what you were headed to.  Someone mentioned the idea of collecting stamps from different religious boxes, and I would probably be one who would go for that.  <br/>

"I say it is the person who places a box in a<br/>
culturally diverse nation that is founded on the principal that by<br/>
keeping religion a private matter (and out of politics) All of us will<br/>
be able to practice our religion in our homes and houses of worship as<br/>
we wish without the fear of governments preventing it or persecuting<br/>
us for it, it is this person that is insensitive and in need of<br/>
practicing tolerance." <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to agree. I believe every person has their right to put out boxes<br/>
with a religious theme. I have no problem with that what so ever. The ones I<br/>
find offensive are the times I'm not given the choice to pass on it.We just<br/>
recently had this same discussion at my house. I received a postal letterbox<br/>
that had NOTHING to do with religion, yet included in the box were<br/>
"evangelical" brochures. So not only did I not ask to read it, I was having<br/>
to PAY to ship it on. If the creator had stated in their original post that<br/>
they planned to include these pamphlets, I would not have signed up for the<br/>
box. It's being given the "choice" to pursue or not peruse that I find<br/>
respectful to all involved. <br/>
<br/>
Here's three instances and how I consider them:<br/>
#1 above mentioned postal box. Not a religious themed box, no mention of<br/>
religion in "clues", just an unwelcome surprise when I get the box. (Not<br/>
appropriate)<br/>
#2 local box - religious themed clues that have nothing to do with the box -<br/>
strange to me, but I can choose to pass on solving the puzzle<br/>
#3 local box - religious themed clues, religious themed box - perfectly<br/>
fine. This one leaves no doubt as to the content of the box. Even though it<br/>
is not my chosen religion, I went and got the box because I appreciated the<br/>
"package" and care they put into it.<br/>
<br/>
So, in my humble opinion, it has to do with choice. Please create boxes that<br/>
share your passions but please give me enough information to choose wisely. <br/>
<br/>
Another way to think about it, how would others feel if I chose to plant a<br/>
HH that was anatomically correct? My household may not find anything wrong<br/>
with nudity, but others may find it offensive. How would those same people<br/>
feel about it if I planted a regular box in the wild, stated in the clues<br/>
that the stamp contained nudity? <br/>

We just found your Boo Boo Bear HH today at WERDEHEKARWE: Secrets of the<br/>
Waterfall in Kane County, IL today.  Copied down all the info from the<br/>
logbook and sent it to Wanda and Pete so they could update since it's listed<br/>
on their site.  Cute little boo boo bear.  Twelve stamps so far.  Boo Boo<br/>
will be moving a wee bit north later this week.<br/>
<br/>
No, we've never been to RI, but it sounds interesting.  I've only found 57<br/>
boxes so far and I don't think any of them are stamps of humans.  Lots of<br/>
cute animals tho.<br/>

WOW!!!! And the pendulum swings.  To all the fans of observing group dynamics, this has <br/>
been an interesting few days of viewing.  IMHO, any box of spiritual meaning is fine;  it's <br/>
when you tag it religious that makes it less okay to me.  I'd rather be called spiritual any <br/>
day.  Let's keep and share the faith (of many peoples)!<br/>

&gt; Yes, that's me!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; We just found your Boo Boo Bear HH today at<br/>
&gt; WERDEHEKARWE: Secrets of <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Waterfall in Kane County, IL today.  Copied down<br/>
&gt; all the info from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; logbook and sent it to Wanda and Pete so they<br/>
&gt; could update since it's <br/>
&gt; listed<br/>
&gt; &gt; on their site.  Cute little boo boo bear.  Twelve<br/>
&gt; stamps so far.  Boo <br/>
&gt; Boo<br/>
&gt; &gt; will be moving a wee bit north later this week.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll be *very* curious to see how this HH got from<br/>
&gt; RI to IL!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks so much for updating Pete about its travels. <br/>
&gt; Of all the HHs <br/>
&gt; I've released, this is the first time I've actually<br/>
&gt; heard about one of <br/>
&gt; them "out in the wild".<br/>

&gt; I can tell you how it got from CT to IL- I taught my<br/>
parents how to letterbox while they were visiting for<br/>
a week, and among the 70 or so boxes they did with me,<br/>
we found Boo Boo bear HH in a box in Norwich.  We all<br/>
decided that it would be more fun for them to take it<br/>
back to IL with them than for me to hide it again in<br/>
CT.  I made them promise that they would release it<br/>
within a month, so this weekend they boxed in IL for<br/>
the first time and dropped it off-and found another HH<br/>
as well.         -S<br/>
