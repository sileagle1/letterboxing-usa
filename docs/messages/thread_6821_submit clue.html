                      SUTTON, VT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the trailhead:<br/>
<br/>
The trail begins on Wheeler Mountain Road, a right off US route 5,<br/>
8.3 miles north of the junction of routes 5 and 5A in West Burke, VT.<br/>
Wheeler Mountain Road is unpaved.  Follow it for 1.9 miles to the<br/>
trailhead and parking on the left just past the second of two houses.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
The trail cuts through private property so please act accordingly.<br/>
At 0.1 mile the trail divides with the white trail straight and the red<br/>
trail to the right.  Either trail can be taken as they rejoin near where <br/>
the letterbox is hidden.  The red trail is more interesting and slightly<br/>
shorter but is steeper and requires scrambling over some large rocks.<br/>
We usually ascend the red trail and descend the white.  The trails <br/>
rejoin at an open rock area with good views and the word "JUNCTION"<br/>
painted on the rock.<br/>
<br/>
At the two double-headed arrows, one red and one white, just before<br/>
"JUNCTION" take 8 paces North (uncorrected for compass deviation).<br/>
Then duck through the brush Northeast for another 8 paces to find the<br/>
letterbox under a rock overhang.<br/>
<br/>
Before returning down the mountain we recommend continuing another 0.6 <br/>
mile up the trail to Eagle Cliff with great views of Lake Willoughby<br/>
and Mt. Pisgah.<br/>
