&gt; News flash: CT.to UTAH ended up crashing a mini gather today in<br/>
&gt; Mansfield CT. held for the folks who have 'hit' F.500.  The pending<br/>
&gt; storm for tomorrow brought out the 'Utah" crowd today and we combined<br/>
&gt; both gathers.   A cold and windy parking lot gather did little to<br/>
&gt; hamper the fun.  Folks ran from car to car and everyone stamped into<br/>
&gt; the boxes that I am taking to Utah.  We are sending off lots of<br/>
&gt; exciting boxes for you 'Rocky Mt. folks to enjoy.  Most will stay in<br/>
&gt; the Salt Lake City area but we invite letterboxer to take some of them<br/>
&gt; home to plant in other places<br/>
&gt; Contack me or Cadenza off line if you would like a box from CT. to<br/>
&gt; plant.  <br/>
&gt; All of these boxes contain hand carved stamps and now hold the<br/>
&gt; personal stmps and a message from all that were present today [14<br/>
folks ]<br/>
&gt; Looking to meet some of you westerns just aftr the New Year.<br/>
