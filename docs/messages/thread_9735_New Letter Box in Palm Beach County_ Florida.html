<br/>
Location: The Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens<br/>
          Delray Beach, Palm Beach County, Florida<br/>
<br/>
    This is a wonderful place that not everybody knows about. It is <br/>
located in western Delray Beach. Directions can be found at <br/>
www.morikami.org<br/>
<br/>
    After parking, enter the main museum building to pay your <br/>
admission. You can get a map then. The gallery inside is always <br/>
interesting and well-presented, but the prize you are after lies <br/>
along the garden walk which circles the lake.<br/>
<br/>
    It is supposed to be traveled in a counter-clockwise fashion. The <br/>
path takes you through several Japanese period gardens, past stone <br/>
lanterns, a bamboo grove, waterfalls, even a grave. Eventually you <br/>
will come to an island wit a model of an imperial villa (the Yamato-<br/>
kan) which contains a history of early Japanese immigrants to the <br/>
area. There are also many bonsai trees and gorgeous koi carp you can <br/>
feed.<br/>
<br/>
    After the island with the Yamato-kan, the path continues to a <br/>
rocky point jutting out into the lake. Find the bench that faces the <br/>
curved bridge and the main museum. Have a seat next to the big <br/>
boulder on the right (red granite from Texas). When no one is around, <br/>
look down behind the boulder and you will have your prize. <br/>
<br/>
    After stamping, keep on to the Morikami Falls and back up to the <br/>
museum (the exit). You can have a nice lunch at the Cornell Cafe and <br/>
visit the gift shop (they have some great stuff).<br/>
