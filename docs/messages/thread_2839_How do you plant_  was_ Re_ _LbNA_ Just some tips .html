<br/>
I would like information from the list on how you go about planting your<br/>
letterboxes..mainly, how and when do you write your clues?  Do you plant<br/>
first, then figure out your clues, or ???  How do you make sure that someone<br/>
unfamiliar with the area will be able to follow the instructions -- ideally,<br/>
I guess, your directions would be verified by someone with a "fresh eye",<br/>
but if that is not possible?<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, once we *do* plant letterboxes, how do we disseminate clues?  I<br/>
know that we can post them here, but other than that, do we need to put them<br/>
on our own web page to be linked to from letterboxing.org?  Do we notify<br/>
that webmaster?  Any other people/sites that should be notified?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, are there any no-no's about planting letterboxes in areas that<br/>
require admission?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any guidance,<br/>
Ann in MA<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Just some tips and observations<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My girl friend and I are relatively new to this sport/pastime.  I have a<br/>
&gt; very extensive mapping and orienteering background in the eastern United<br/>
&gt; states.  I grew up in Bucks County, PA and know the parks and trials like<br/>
&gt; the back of my hand.  As a leterboxing hunter for about a year now<br/>
(hunting<br/>
&gt; mostly PA, NJ and DE boxes)<br/>
&gt; I have made some observations as to clues and directions and box placing<br/>
&gt; that would help make the sport more enjoyable, and not as frustrating.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please realize that the environment changes and trails change sometimes<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; night, They can be reblazed and re-routed so if you place a box in an area<br/>
&gt; you either need to re-visit the box to see if the clues still fit the<br/>
local<br/>
&gt; or give one or two backup clues of solid landmarks, directions or headings<br/>
&gt; to help the "would-be" box hunter re-adjust their assumptions.  If not,<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; may have hikers off trail in places they shouldn't be, chasing an<br/>
assumption<br/>
&gt; not a fact.  Try to use good landmarks (Monuments, Historical sites, Old<br/>
&gt; trees, Large rocks...if it looks like it's been there forever it probably<br/>
&gt; has, and will be for a long time.) as well as headings, paces and<br/>
direction.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just this weekend we were in Tyler state park seeking a box.  The<br/>
placement<br/>
&gt; of the box was near a body of water (river) and on trails that are<br/>
&gt; frequented by horses and bikes.   --Here is a double whammy.  When placing<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; box near a river you have to take into account the flood plane... and that<br/>
&gt; in a big storm (like the one we in that park had last mouth) could flood<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; area (9'under).  Water and debris from down stream can accumulate and make<br/>
&gt; the box un-retrievable.  Also horse and bike trails change very<br/>
frequently.<br/>
&gt; Some riders choose to go around obstacles in the trail and create new<br/>
trails<br/>
&gt; parallel to the old one.  Since a horse is large and heavy and in wearing<br/>
&gt; some kind shoe the trails get cut very quickly.  One or two horses more<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; you have a new fork head.  So if you navigate your clues with trail heads<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; T's or forks, it can be quite confusing of you do not back it up with a<br/>
real<br/>
&gt; landmark.  Try to avoid stumps for It is likely to be removed as it<br/>
&gt; deteriorates.  There's a box at Pea Patch Island that uses a tree stump as<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; landmark.  It was removed.  Though frustrated we eventually found the box.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There's a box near Hopewell furnace (we were the first to find) that uses<br/>
&gt; Trees and Trails sometimes as lone landmarks...the trails are for biking<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; hiking so the heads and especially the T in the clue was re-forged into an<br/>
&gt; intersection, since there was no other CLEAR clue or landmark this led us<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; a 3mi un-necessary hike. We found the box, after a full day of hiking and<br/>
&gt; re-hiking and re-guessing, and moving our car(due to the lot closing)...,<br/>
&gt; but we were VERY FRUSTRATED.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Avoid using GPS for your clues, it is very unlikely that the average<br/>
hunter<br/>
&gt; has this type of device.  It is likely that they're armed with a $12.00<br/>
&gt; compass from REI so If you do use GPS check out the heading with a cheap<br/>
&gt; Silva and note the variation in your clue.  Even using GPS and<br/>
&gt; survey-mapping the course before setting out can still be. (usually pacing<br/>
&gt; is about + or - 10% - compass headings + or - 5% to 8%)  even if you<br/>
factor<br/>
&gt; this into the clue you still should be + or - 10% to 12% off in your clue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It's funny but the box's that have been placed in problem areas, with<br/>
vague<br/>
&gt; clues and landmarks seem to be the ones that have no stamps in them.  It's<br/>
&gt; not an ego trip here folks, be smart, have fun....you may learn something<br/>
&gt; about the environment around us and just how precious and ever-changing it<br/>
&gt; is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good hunting<br/>

&gt; I would like information from the list on how you go about planting your<br/>
&gt; letterboxes..mainly, how and when do you write your clues?  Do you plant<br/>
&gt; first, then figure out your clues, or ???  <br/>
<br/>
I decide strategically what I want to do, and what approach I want to<br/>
take.<br/>
<br/>
Then I get to know the area and decide where I want the thing to be,<br/>
in keeping with the general approach.<br/>
<br/>
Then, almost without fail, I work backward from the hiding place to<br/>
the starting place, noting features, and using features that will work<br/>
well in the prose of the general approach.  More often than not, the<br/>
features will alter the general approach, so it is an iterative <br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
Then I fill in the text of the clue.<br/>
<br/>
Then, if it is local to where I am, I vet the completed clue by starting <br/>
at the starting place and going to the hiding place, and check off each <br/>
word and each feature, and look for things that can genuinely be <br/>
misconstrued, both in the text, and in the terrain.<br/>
<br/>
Then I put the clue on my web site.<br/>
<br/>
Then I post a link to the clue to this list.<br/>
<br/>
The webmasters then link to it.<br/>
<br/>
This is just one way to do it.  There are other, prolly simpler,<br/>
and better ways.  I do know that the webmasters would prefer if<br/>
we all maintained our own clue pages, so their job of simply linking<br/>
to them rather than converting and publishing them would be easier.<br/>
If you don't have the resources to do this, then posting the clue<br/>
to the list is what usually happens.  This allows the webmasters <br/>
to be slow or link to the archive until they have time to republish<br/>
the clue.  The webmasters prefer if the county is specified, unless it<br/>
is a mystery clue.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Lastly, are there any no-no's about planting letterboxes in areas that<br/>
&gt; require admission?<br/>
<br/>
The fact that admission is charged, IMO, does not present a no-no<br/>
above and beyond any other no-nos that may be associated with the<br/>
location.<br/>
