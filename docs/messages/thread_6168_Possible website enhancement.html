<br/>
I have read all the postings on this thread with interest, and thank posters<br/>
for their kind comments. I'm sure I speak for all the webmasters in this. We<br/>
are glad of this kind of open discussion. These are issues that have come up<br/>
before over the past four years, but it is useful to rehash them and, hear<br/>
new opinions, and maybe come to new conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
The problem of exponential growth has been a major concern all along, even<br/>
when there were only a few dozen boxes. Knowing that growth threatened to<br/>
overwhelm us two years ago, we shifted the organization of the website to<br/>
the current tabular form. Previously it was map-based, and we had different<br/>
layers of maps that showed the precise location of every box (well, pretty<br/>
close.)<br/>
<br/>
Even now that it is much easier for us to manage, it still will eventually<br/>
become unworkable. A database system that is self-regulating, such as<br/>
Jeremy's elegant geocaching site, is one way to go. But as someone<br/>
mentioned, reentering several thousand clues is not something anyone wants<br/>
to do. We would have to leave it up to individuals to enter their own boxes,<br/>
and many boxes would be left out, I believe. Maybe that's okay.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have voiced concerns about an open system that might permit<br/>
others to modify the clues to their own boxes. I don't know if the<br/>
geocaching site has password protection to keep Jill from altering Jack's<br/>
clues, or putting in comments that the box is lost (when that may not be the<br/>
case.)<br/>
<br/>
That leads into the question of keeping track of a box's status. It would be<br/>
great to have a database for that, in which people could post the dates they<br/>
found the box or didn't find the box, and the kind of shape it was in, etc.<br/>
There have been good arguments in the past in favor putting status notes on<br/>
the clue pages only if the owner requests them.<br/>
<br/>
A separate database or page or simply a talk list would be a way of doing<br/>
this. I don't think this is something we webmasters can do, but someone else<br/>
could start a status talk list: very simple reporting, consistent formatting<br/>
in the subject line to make archive searches work. The sort of list you<br/>
probably wouldn't want to have messages downloaded, but just go to when you<br/>
wanted to hunt for a box.<br/>
<br/>
That's just one thought that occured to me while writing this. There may be<br/>
reasons it wouldn't work, or other ways tha are preferable.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, as to dividing the country up into regions, Arlen, we have pretty<br/>
much done that. A year ago we had five people updating clues, and that<br/>
seemed to be fine. But Ruthann Zaroff, who was doing the Great Lakes region,<br/>
dropped out, and Mitch Klink, who was doing most of the western half of the<br/>
country, had to stop updating as well. So the remaining three of us are<br/>
covering those regions in something of a piecemeal fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Ruthann is coming back on board for the Great Lakes region next month. Mitch<br/>
also may be finishing up the project that has kept him away.<br/>
<br/>
We thank the people who have recently offered to help. We have a couple of<br/>
people in mind to ask, but we are always glad to hear offers of assistance.<br/>
<br/>
I think most people are somewhat aware of who the webmasters are, but just<br/>
so everyone knows....<br/>
<br/>
Jay Chamberlin, Jay Drew, and I currently do the updates, with Ruthann soon<br/>
to rejoin in this area.. We each have different states and other<br/>
responsibilities (Jay D. does the What's New page for example), but we help<br/>
each other out on request.<br/>
<br/>
Susan Davis and Thom Cheney are not updating, but provide lots of good<br/>
ideas, and have been handling the PR work recently with various agencies<br/>
(state parks, NFS, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Mitch Klink has been involved in this site (or previous incarnations) longer<br/>
than anyone. The current parchment scroll/book motif of the site was his<br/>
design.<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of this background info is helpful. As I said, we are glad of<br/>
all discussion that can help keep the site functioning usefully as our hobby<br/>
grows.<br/>

Thanks for the overview!  I was hoping you'd chime <br/>
in and appreciate your viewpoints.  <br/>
<br/>
A total rewrite of the site was not exactly what <br/>
I had in mind.  Frankly, I like the approach Mitch <br/>
put together on a state to state basis just fine. <br/>
Our biggest frustration now are missing boxes and <br/>
wrong clue information to get to them.<br/>
<br/>
I also would be willing to volunteer some time to <br/>
help support the existing structure, and since I've<br/>
been teaching myself Dreamweaver I'm almost dangerously<br/>
qualified.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
It is true, any change will take some coding time and <br/>
if someone wants to spearhead that project I certainly<br/>
believe it's a reasonable goal for the future, but not<br/>
necessarily one that can be addressed in the immediate<br/>
timeframe.  <br/>
<br/>
Thus, in the meantime I propose the addition of a "comment<br/>
or two" that will allow a searcher to report a believed<br/>
to be missing box and the date, and an owner to respond in kind to <br/>
either confirm or deny the claim.  On the simplest of terms,<br/>
this equates to nothing more than the addition of a comment <br/>
at the top of the clue page for each box, when a box meets <br/>
the missing criteria.  This process change will firmly tie the <br/>
responsibility to maintain all placed boxes with the owner, not the <br/>
webmasters or the searchers.<br/>
<br/>
Based on my coding experience, the addition of such alert messages <br/>
will certainly not take an extra abundant amount of time to how the <br/>
process already works, and will ensure all searchers will have access <br/>
to the most up to date data on whether a box is out there or not.  The<br/>
addition will mean more box clue sheets will need to be updated, but I<br/>
strongly believe that is a better choice than pretending there is no <br/>
problem.<br/>

I still recommend when a box can't be located there is an email <br/>
exchange between the searcher and the owner to try and resolve, but <br/>
in the cases where the owner doesn't live in the placed box vacinity <br/>
or there is no email or resolution response from them in a timely <br/>
manner, a missing box comment will work to serve the masses and keep <br/>
this exciting hobby of ours fun for ourselves and future boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Please consider my idea and lets have further discussions if you think<br/>
there is a way I can help.<br/>
<br/>

The only problem with this whole concept is that boxes aren't always missing when a searcher fails to find <br/>
them. I can't tell you how many times I have gotten emails telling me a box was missing. Later, either I <br/>
have checked on them and found them in good health or someone else has emailed me telling me about <br/>
their successful hunt. <br/>
I shudder to think of all the data entry that the webmasters would have to do on a daily basis in order to <br/>
keep up with the postings about boxes found or not. I think a seperate update page where individuals <br/>
could enter their own comments without involving the webmasters would be a viable alternative.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; A total rewrite of the site was not exactly what <br/>
&gt; I had in mind.  Frankly, I like the approach Mitch <br/>
&gt; put together on a state to state basis just fine. <br/>
&gt; Our biggest frustration now are missing boxes and <br/>
&gt; wrong clue information to get to them.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Don, I agree completely.  I did not find the first box I ever looked <br/>
for, the beautiful Sheiling Forest stamp in New Hampshire.  But I went <br/>
back a second time, and it was well worth the drive.  I didn't read the <br/>
clue closely enough and pick up the hints regarding the correct trail <br/>
the first time. <br/>
<br/>
When I don't find a box, I don't assume it is missing.  Sometimes <br/>
people have told me one of my boxes is missing, yet when I've checked <br/>
on it, the box is there and people have been stamping in!  Other times, <br/>
the box has indeed disappeared. <br/>
<br/>
I think the best we can do is post status info (if we have it) on the <br/>
clue pages (for those of us who maintain our own Web pages), but I <br/>
can't imagine how the Webmasters could ever keep an accurate "status <br/>
report" for all the boxes out there.<br/>
<br/>
You take your chances!  That's part of the fun.  Last weekend I looked <br/>
for three boxes and found one.  Some are harder than others and <br/>
oftentimes the second attempt is a success.<br/>

seeker to contact the owner "first" and have a dialog about<br/>
the box, before sending any missing note to the webmasters.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with us all having the freedom to enter our own<br/>
comments means a significant rewrite of the existing program,<br/>
which for now we are trying to avoid.  An alternative to this<br/>
that was already pointed out, is for us each to have their own<br/>
web page the site points to where we can freely edit.<br/>
