RE:  Letterboxing in Ireland<br/>
<br/>
My daughter and son-in-law recently moved to Dublin and have found the<br/>
letterboxing opportunities slim.  There are scores of geocaches, but only a<br/>
handful of listed letterboxes.  Part of the problem seems to be a lack of<br/>
Web sites listing boxes in the region -- even the Brits seem to prefer to<br/>
publish letterboxing catalogs.<br/>
<br/>
That said, Gillian said she would be interested in placing a series of boxes<br/>
before your trip, if you are interested.   Also, if other U.S. boxers are<br/>
planning trips to Ireland, she could see what she could organize around a<br/>
"welcome to Ireland" theme.  She is considering a series based on the<br/>
locations mentioned in "Ulysses" by James Joyce.  Would that be of interest?<br/>
