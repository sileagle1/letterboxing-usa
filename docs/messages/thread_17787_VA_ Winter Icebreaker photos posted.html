                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have successfully re-posted the Icebreaker gather photos.  I <br/>
deleted the big copies and posted smaller versions this time (except <br/>
for the overhead and the poster).   Mystery dinner pics too.  I know <br/>
there are a little out of order but I can't change that.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to label some names on them but that wasn't working right.  <br/>
The one I tried to edit just disappeared instead.  Maybe because I <br/>
am not the folder owner.  Still if you can identify people in the <br/>
pictures and write me I'll try to edit the captions.<br/>
