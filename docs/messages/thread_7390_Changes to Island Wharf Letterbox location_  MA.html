location of the Island Wharf letterbox (part of Seaside Series I in <br/>
MA) because of worries about it being too near a porch where someone <br/>
was watching it most of the day.  The box was moved from that <br/>
location, and the clues should now read:<br/>
<br/>
2. Island Wharf<br/>
<br/>
Island Wharf is situated on Front Street in the middle of the Town of <br/>
Marion. Take Route 105 South (Front St). Cross Route 6 at the traffic <br/>
light. Continue on for about 1 mile, passing parts of Taber Academy <br/>
on your right and left. Island Wharf is on your left across from the <br/>
old Taber Music Hall. The Island Wharf area serves as a parking lot <br/>
for the town docks, and for Barden's Boat Yard. Enter and park on <br/>
your left in the dirt parking lot. Anyone can park here by day, but <br/>
overnight parking requires a resident sticker. The Marion Band Shell <br/>
is also located here, and is the site of free concerts on Monday <br/>
evenings at 7:30 pm in the summer months. <br/>
<br/>
The Island Wharf letterbox can be found by crossing the large lawn <br/>
from the parking lot towards the Band Shell (north). Go behind the <br/>
Band Shell, and locate the area where the lawn comes up against a <br/>
metal fence.  On the left end of the fence, there is an opening that <br/>
leads down into an adjacent property (a tidal area).  Turn left at <br/>
this opening, and proceed about 5 paces to the west (toward Front <br/>
St).  Island Wharf letterbox can be found just past the northern edge <br/>
of the lawn, under a flat rock beneath some shrubbery. <br/>
