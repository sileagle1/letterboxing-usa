Hello All<br/>
Yo !<br/>
A interesting day boxing at Burr Pond.  It was great fun to come out of <br/>
the woods and see RTRW and Bookworm , clues in hand heading our way !! <br/>
Thanks you two for sharing the Burr Pond Loop Clues. with us.  Angel <br/>
found the bugs too buggy so after lunch we pack up and drove back to the <br/>
shoreline.<br/>
Engraver and Corrina your  hike is a nice tribute to your grandchildren. <br/>
We missed the first two boxes as we were still reading the clues and had <br/>
long gone past the boxes !!  So we slowed up and found the third one <br/>
first and then after finding the others, went back and found the first <br/>
two.  Thank you for tempting us to take the long drive. We now will go <br/>
back to find the other Burr Pond boxes. Great rocks. ! p.s.  all the <br/>
boxes are well and happy.<br/>
Butterfly<br/>
