<br/>
Sounds like you were very close! I am going back to the region next week, as<br/>
our family takes its annual vacation at Paradox Lake, and will be checking<br/>
in on all three of the Leatherstocking boxes (and hopefully planting<br/>
another.) I will let you know if any of the boxes are missing.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen a sign saying not to climb onto the embankment. If there is<br/>
one, I may have to change the clues.<br/>
<br/>
The Three Musketeers reference is not important for finding the box.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the feedback.<br/>

<div>Lisa and Tom,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just got back from a week in the Adirondacks, and 
was able to check the Carillon Letterbox. It was still there, with Eric's stamp 
the last entered.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You were absolutely right, though, about the sign 
requesting people not to climb up on the bulwarks. And ... the woods in which 
the box is hidden are posted. These are new developments since last 
summer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So ... I have rehidden the box in the same general 
area, but now in a place where you do not have to disregard any no trepassing 
signs in order to find it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thnaks very much for this heads up. I hope you have 
a chance to visit there again.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The clues are at</div>
