Way in Ogunquit, Maine. Clues are posted on the website. The Fort <br/>
Foster Letterbox was also planted today in Kittery, Maine. Clues will <br/>
be posted soon.<br/>
Also, Culex and I went looking for and found the following <br/>
letterboxes this afternoon:<br/>
1) Mount A in York<br/>
2) The State of Maine in York<br/>
3) Nubble Light and the Mouser in York<br/>
4) Seahorse in Kittery (had a bit of difficulty at first, and <br/>
even stumbled across a geocache by accident, but eventually found it)<br/>
We were hoping to find a hitch hiker, but no such luck. Oh well. Maybe <br/>
we'll have time to get out tomorrow for a bit!<br/>
