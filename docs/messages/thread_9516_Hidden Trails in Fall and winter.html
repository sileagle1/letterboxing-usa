Are others having trouble locating the trails under all the fall leaves?  (I <br/>
know they are dealing with snow in CT!)  I understand that the blazes help <br/>
on the bigger paths, but what about the smaller ones where the ground just <br/>
looks worn down or a lawn mower cuts a path?  Is that why people cut back in <br/>
the winter (or is it just the cold?)<br/>
<br/>
What happens to the boxes in the spring?  Do the leaves blow away or <br/>
decompose or are the boxes buried a little deeper? Just curious.  BeMa<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Trails look different each season. If you are not careful you can easily go off a trail in the fall and snow is worse. You have to really be careful in when in a unfamilier area. I think people cut back on  letterboxing in the winter for several reasons, cold, difficulty walking and the snow making it harder to find a letterbox/. Last winter I went to a letterbox that was under a rock. I found the rock but it was so frozen to the ground I couldn't move it. In the spring the boxes are basically how you left them. There may be some leaves or twigs on them but pretty much just like you left them. The leafs don't build up too much in one season.....Chuck and Molly

missed lately!  One of the biggest reasons why I cut back in the <br/>
winter (other than the obvious more foul weather reason) is the lack <br/>
of daylight.  In the summer I go out letterboxing a lot after work.  <br/>
I the winter I can't go at all during the week after work because it <br/>
is dark.  I first started letterboxing in February ... back then I <br/>
didn't know it was supposed to be harder in winter LOL.<br/>
