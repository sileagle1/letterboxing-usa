This box is on the Carriage Trail, which we accessed from the Station Bridge <br/>
Parking lot. Go 1.4 miles on the towpath towards Peninsula . We did this on <br/>
our bicycles but it is a nice walk too. Bring a bike lock if you do bike, <br/>
because bikes are not allowed on the carriage trail.You will come to the <br/>
carriage trail on your left.<br/>
NOTE: if you are coming to the Carriage Trail from Peninsula, the trail <br/>
connects with the towpath in TWO places, you would want to take the second <br/>
access on the right.<br/>
If you take the first Carriage Trail you will have a LONG walk thru the woods <br/>
to get to the letterbox.<br/>
Back to the directions, go up the Carriage Trail till you are almost to the <br/>
top of the hill. When you are close to the top of the hill the trail will <br/>
split, take the left trail, it is like a switchback turn. This leads to a <br/>
loop with a log bench on the left side of the loop.Sit on the bench facing <br/>
the downhill woods. Get up and walk 64 paces into the woods(260 west). <br/>
Walah!!!! Behind a standing dead oak you will find the Kiwi, fresh in from <br/>
New Zealand.<br/>
Happy Stamping!!!!<br/>
