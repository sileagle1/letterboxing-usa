Fox Run Park Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by Lisa 8/29/02 - In El Paso County, Colorado, between the <br/>
towns of Colorado Springs and Monument.<br/>
<br/>
"Easy access" - only about a ten minute hike to the letterbox, and <br/>
easy clues.<br/>
<br/>
(Bring a lunch and stay to enjoy the park with its playgrounds and <br/>
two ponds and gazebo)<br/>
<br/>
A "pace" here is just my normal walking pace - I am 5'8". At the <br/>
beginning of the walk, I have given several "pace" measurements along <br/>
with landmarks, so you can see if your paces are too big or too small <br/>
compared to mine.<br/>
<br/>
__ Enter Fox Run Regional Park from the Stella Drive Entrance.<br/>
<br/>
__ Go left at the T intersection<br/>
<br/>
__ Park at Pavilion #4<br/>
<br/>
__ From parking lot, find Bearing 12' and follow it to the stop sign<br/>
<br/>
__ Look to the right. See across the road there's a little trail. <br/>
Take 33 paces to get to trail<br/>
<br/>
__ Follow trail up hill (through the Ponderosa pine trees) to a T in <br/>
the trail<br/>
<br/>
__ You will take the left path and follow it 195 paces (you should <br/>
pass a sign telling about Pygmy Nuthatches on your left, and the <br/>
Lower Pond on your right.)<br/>
<br/>
__ Notice that now there is a stream on your right.<br/>
<br/>
__ Keep following the trail up the hill, and now notice Upper Pond on <br/>
your right.<br/>
<br/>
__ Go straight to where the trail crosses the road, and cross to the <br/>
north side where the trail continues.<br/>
<br/>
__ Hike up the hill to the top, about 185 paces. <br/>
<br/>
__ You should now notice a manhole and a pipe to your right.<br/>
<br/>
__ Look to the left side of the trail. There are two trees that are <br/>
close together (about one pace apart). Go stand between them.<br/>
<br/>
__ Find North on your compass. Follow the trail North 130 pace.<br/>
<br/>
__ Notice a sign on your right that says "Natural Area Policy."<br/>
<br/>
__ Find Bearing 8' on your compass. Fix a target and go 45 paces in <br/>
that direction.<br/>
<br/>
__ Find Bearing 320' on your compass. Fix a target and go 18 paces in <br/>
that direction.<br/>
<br/>
__ Notice a pine tree about 8" wide on your right, and then notice <br/>
three smaller trees also on your right but farther from the trail, <br/>
that make a kind of  \ ! ! shape together.<br/>
<br/>
__ Find Bearing 50' on your compass and go 13 paces in this <br/>
direction. (This should take you past the three \ ! ! trees, and they <br/>
should be on your left.)<br/>
<br/>
__ Look to the left and notice two old logs. The Fox Run Letterbox is <br/>
underneath them.<br/>
<br/>
__ Place your special stamp imprint on a page in the notebook in the <br/>
box. <br/>
<br/>
__ Then place the special Fox Run stamp imprint on a page in your <br/>
notebook.<br/>
<br/>
__ Replace the box under the logs exactly as you found it.<br/>
<br/>
__ Time to go play by the pond!  Enjoy your day.<br/>
