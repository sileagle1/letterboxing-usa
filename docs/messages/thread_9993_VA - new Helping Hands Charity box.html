2,03.  Or, because all the stamps in its logbook will hopefully add up as <br/>
quickly as 1,2,3, donating some much needed money to worthy charities.  <br/>
Whatever the name, we hope you enjoy this new box.  BeMa<br/>

HELPING HANDS CHARITY BOX<br/>
<br/>
Meadowlark Gardens<br/>
Vienna, VA<br/>
Planted by BeMa<br/>
January 2, 2003<br/>
Directions  easy<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
HELPING HANDS is a charity box.  Team BeMa has pledged to donate $1 for <br/>
every new stamp signed into the logbook in a given month.  Each month will <br/>
be dedicated to a specific charity that has meaning for our family. Brief <br/>
information on these charities can be found in the box.  The following <br/>
charities have been selected to date:<br/>
Jan  Marthas Table (www.marthastable.org).  This organization feeds 1,200 <br/>
hungry and homeless people 365 days a year.  Over 3,500 sandwiches, 65 <br/>
gallons of soup and 65 gallons of beverage daily  all from volunteers and <br/>
donations.<br/>
Feb  SPCA of Northern VA. (www.spcanova.org).  The Society for the <br/>
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is a non-profit, all-volunteer, private <br/>
organization established by local concerned citizens to rescue domestic <br/>
animals from cruelty, neglect and abandonment.  They foster these animals <br/>
and sponsor them for adoption.<br/>
Mar  local PBS stations (www.mpt.org and www.weta.org).  These local PBS <br/>
affiliates provide quality and educational, commercial free programs for <br/>
children and adults.<br/>
Apr  Special Olympics (www.specialolympics.org).  This international <br/>
organization is dedicated to empowering individuals with mental retardation <br/>
to become physically fit, productive and respected members of society <br/>
through sports training and competition.  Their motto is Let me win.  But <br/>
if I cannot win, let me be brave in the attempt.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for helping us to help others!<br/>

When Be was a little baby and I was a new mom, I desperately needed to get <br/>
out of the house!  I would load his little stroller in the car with the <br/>
requisite bottle, snacks, wipes, blanket, musical toys, pacifiers, etc. and <br/>
head off to Meadowlark Gardens.  Here, we would stroll up and down the paths <br/>
in peace and quiet -- one with nature (unless Be had gas).  One day, I <br/>
pushed his stroller up a winding dirt path (its since been paved).  We <br/>
strolled onward and upward (occasionally getting mired in the mud and <br/>
bumping over rocks and ruts) until we came to what is my favorite resting <br/>
place.  The structure is lovely and the view is inspirational.  We would sit <br/>
up there eating dried apricots and saltines listening to his stuffed <br/>
giraffes chiming version of Talk to the Animals.  We hope that you enjoy <br/>
it as much!  (P.S.  we give a lot of landmarks so you will know you are on <br/>
the right path and because Be and Ma get a kick out of spotting them)<br/>
