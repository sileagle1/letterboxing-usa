We have hidden our first letterbox and were unable to<br/>
post or join talklist at www.letterboxing.org<br/>
We're really excited and want others to be able to<br/>
find it A.S.A.P.!!! (Especially since there seem to<br/>
bevery few in our area!)<br/>
We'll tell you the clues here and please post them or<br/>
forward them - or if worse comes to worse let us<br/>
knowhow we can do it.<br/>
Here are our first-ever clues:<br/>
<br/>
"Two Cats and a Troll Griffith Park Letterbox"<br/>
Los Angeles, California<br/>
Griffith Park<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
<br/>
1.) Enter Griffith Park at the Western Entrance off<br/>
Franklin (near corner where Western turns<br/>
intoFranklin).<br/>
2.) Go straight, past the Ferndell sign, on your left.<br/>
Pass the narrow bridge to the stop sign. Just pastthat<br/>
is a parking lot. Park.<br/>
3.) Walk to the Southern corner of the parking lot and<br/>
look directly through the split that the two huge tree<br/>
trunks form (looks like a huge 'V').<br/>
4.) Follow the path you see formed by a tiny rock<br/>
walland fern covered fence.<br/>
5.) Turn left and walk through the gate. Walk down<br/>
steps to the bridge but turn right, do not<br/>
crossbridge.<br/>
6.) Continue following the path. Cross the tiny<br/>
bridge. There is a little stream on your right.<br/>
7.) Cross the second bridge and under two more (one<br/>
wooden, one concrete). The stream is now on your left.<br/>
8.) Cross another bridge. Admire the waterfall<br/>
immediately to your right (manmade so not on all<br/>
year). Look at the elephant ears.<br/>
9.) The box is hidden across from the elephant<br/>
earswhere a troll might live.<br/>
10.) Climb down, turn 180 degrees, hug the rocks in<br/>
front of you, the box is hidden by your left thigh,<br/>
waist or chest depending on your height.<br/>
Be discrete!! I recommend sitting at the bench a few<br/>
more paces past the waterfall to stamp up.Happy<br/>
Hunting!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome California LBers!!!!! To make it very easy for our Web Masters put this on your subject line--- Calif.,LA county,by Hamish &amp; cousin. Then in the text list The Title,where it was placed , when it was placed, who placed it, and then proceed with your clues. The most important thing would be to make sure the subject line has the state &amp; county &amp; maybe the city.That will alert the proper Web Master and you will find that your clues will be posted faster. We have an extremely efficient Web Master for Calif. ( I am kneeling as I am typing this post ) and we need to treat him royally for his work. Don <br/>
