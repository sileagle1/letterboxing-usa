Level of difficulty: Easy<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is part of the Big Papio Trail letterbox series.<br/>
<br/>
The Location<br/>
<br/>
Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska. Richard &amp; Annette Bloch Cancer<br/>
Survivor Park<br/>
<br/>
The Richard &amp; Annette Bloch Cancer Survivor Park is located near One<br/>
Pacific Place at 105th and Pacific Avenue. This park is dedicated to<br/>
fighting and surviving cancer. Learn more about the Cancer Survivor<br/>
Parks at the following link:<br/>

<br/>
The Clues<br/>
<br/>
* Locate the Party of Eight. Traverse the maze from start to finish.<br/>
<br/>
* Walk south to the Tower of Light. Nearby stands a Muted Sentinel<br/>
(unless he's been re-voiced)<br/>
<br/>
* Walk north. Seek and accept support from your left.<br/>
<br/>
* Continue north until you find a qualified doctor, but stop a few<br/>
steps short.<br/>
<br/>
* Have a seat with your back to the setting sun.<br/>
<br/>
* Actually, you need a second opinion. Try sitting with your back to<br/>
the rising sun.<br/>
<br/>
* Most choices are yours to make freely. This Choice, like iron to a<br/>
magnet, is already made, and lies just beneath you. <br/>
