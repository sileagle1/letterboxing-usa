I read about letterboxing about a year ago in a Hartford Courant <br/>
article, which I cut out and showed around.  I had no one express any <br/>
interest in it, but on my 42nd birthday (4/16) I dragged my wife and <br/>
2 daughters (4 &amp; 6) out to Wadsworth Falls in Middlefield CT.<br/>
We only did the first box, as we thought the girls had enough.  The <br/>
excitement of finding our first box ran through all of us.  My four <br/>
yr old (Aubrey) kept asking on the way back to the van if we could go <br/>
back to that SAME box.  We told her we would go again soon, although <br/>
I did not know how soon.  Two days later at the insistance of my wife <br/>
and girls, we set out to find some more boxes, this time the ESAK <br/>
boxes in our hometown of Southington.  This was a more strenuous <br/>
trail and we could only do the first box (about 1/2 mile uphill) on <br/>
the first day as it started to thunder and lightning halfway to the <br/>
box(fish head).  Two days later we decided to tackle the 2nd box and <br/>
never realized that it was pretty vertical in spots.  The kids were <br/>
great, though and loved every minute of it.  It was a full non stop <br/>
vetical hour to this second box, and pretty slippery in spots.  The <br/>
clues were great, and by the time we found it-we were thrilled and <br/>
extremely proud of our little hikers.  Anyone who has done this box <br/>
will realize it probably isn't a good trek for a 4 and 6 yr old, but <br/>
we did not want to stop cuz we didnt know how close we were.  Of <br/>
course, the kids wanted to keep going.  It was already almost 5:00pm <br/>
and we had 40 mins down hill to get to the van, so we called it a <br/>
day. So we did 3 boxes in our first week, which is not bad cuz I am <br/>
built like a pasta salesman.  We are going again this week or <br/>
weekend, and have more confidence in the strength and stamina of our <br/>
little ones than we thought possible, which will open it up for us to <br/>
do even more boxes.  We are loving our new found family hobby and <br/>
thank you all for your hard work and dedication in planting all of <br/>
these boxes and clues.  We are moving to Florida in July and will <br/>
plant some boxes there in hopes of eventually having the high <br/>
concentration that our native Connecticut has.<br/>
<br/>
God bless,<br/>

convince a friend to go along.<br/>
