                    <div class="plaintext-content">A short time back, I mentioned my son is working on letterboxing as a 4-H<br/>
project and, in large part, is trying to make the hobby more accessible to<br/>
physically and mentally challenged youths. Part of what he has developed<br/>
thus far is a rating system to include whenever he places his own box and to<br/>
list in his field notes after he finds boxes.<br/>
<br/>
He's asked me to post this here for feedback from any letterboxers who<br/>
either a) have a physical or mental challenge, or b) have children that go<br/>
out with them hunting. Other feedback is welcome but please keep in mind,<br/>
this is written by a child for children and the disabled so don't attack him<br/>
if you think his idea of "extreme" is "easy" for you the adult warrior<br/>
without disabilities or children to consider. He knows that some people list<br/>
boxes as "easy" on the site and it requires extensive bushwhacking, climbing<br/>
of steep cliffs, etc. It's part of why he wanted a clear system for his own<br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Before I list what he has developed, I'll explain how he derived them. He<br/>
and I read through our personal stack of hiking and backpacking books and<br/>
additionally checked both websites and outside books for how they were<br/>
"rating" hikes. What he found was that most places that give a good<br/>
description of their ratings follow very closely to one another in terms of<br/>
how they decided what rating to give - walking rate, amount of climbing and<br/>
bushwhacking, etc. So this list isn't a unique one, just his modifications<br/>
to the descriptions are designed for the audience he is gearing the project<br/>
towards. On a side note, I can email anyone who wants the list of books he<br/>
has in his official bibliography for this aspect of the project.<br/>
<br/>
Now for the list...<br/>
<br/>
Fully Accessible<br/>
Open to all ages including early walkers and those in wheelchairs. Distance<br/>
can be covered at a walking pace of 2+ miles per hour with no or almost no<br/>
inclines of more than 100 feet. Trail may or may not be paved but is<br/>
suitable for wheeled transportation (strollers, walkers, wheelchairs) and is<br/>
safe for the visually impaired.<br/>
<br/>
Very Easy<br/>
Open to all ages including early walkers. Distance can be covered at a<br/>
walking pace of 2+ miles per hour with no or almost no inclines of more than<br/>
100 feet. Trail suitable for large wheeled transportation but walkers and<br/>
light strollers may have difficulty. Trail safe for visually impaired with<br/>
assistance.<br/>
<br/>
Easy<br/>
Open to all ages including early walkers. Distance can be covered at a<br/>
walking pace of 1.5 to 2 miles per hour with no inclines of greater than 200<br/>

strollers may have difficulty. Trail safe for visually impaired with<br/>
assistance.<br/>
<br/>
Moderate<br/>

Trail not suitable for wheeled transportation or the visually impaired. Box<br/>
may or may not be accessible to children.<br/>
<br/>
Challenging<br/>
For experienced older walkers. Distance covered at an average pace under 1<br/>
mile per hour or with many climbing segments or with the inclusion of off<br/>
trail hiking for some distance. Trail not suitable for the very young,<br/>
wheeled transportation, visually impaired and care should be take with<br/>
mentally challenged. Box most likely not accessible to children.<br/>
<br/>
Extreme<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmm... I like what you've got here, but I have a couple of suggestions. I <br/>
notice that you only mention an overall distance in the "Extreme" category ('may <br/>
be more than 5 miles'). My first reaction is that I'd like to see that feature <br/>
in the other categories and perhaps not the speed of the walker (eg 2 miles <br/>
per hour etc) as I find that less helpful. I say that, because, not everyone <br/>
knows their average speed, and I know that when I lead groups of children (esp <br/>
those less than 7 yrs old) or special needs groups in my work, they often walk <br/>
MUCH slower than 1.5 mph (and likewise there are many that could outpace me!). <br/>
I know that I really appreciate knowing the approximate distance of a hike as <br/>
it helps me plan my outings.<br/>
<br/>
I'm interested to see what you ultimately come up with. Good work!<br/>
<br/>
As a general aside to you, considering the state of the world, I think <br/>
somewhere in your descriptions you have to have a disclaimer stressing that it is <br/>
ultimately the hiker's or group leader's responsibility to judge what is <br/>
appropriate. This will hopefully cover yourself liability-wise.<br/>
<br/>
As a general aside to...well, I guess the world in general, no one will ever <br/>
make the perfect description, so people have to take responsibility for their <br/>
own safety and actions. In other words, if you choose to visit a site, you <br/>
take on the responsibililty of judging how far you should go and when you should <br/>
stop if you judge something to be beyond your abilities or your group's <br/>
abilities. <br/>
<br/>
It is unfortunate that the world (at least the American culture) has become <br/>
that way, but many people believe that the world should "hold their hand" <br/>
rather than believing that their actions are the result of their own choices. If <br/>
you choose poorly, it is not the world's fault. Likewise if you don't have the <br/>
presence of mind to know when you've reached your limits on a hunt, it is not <br/>
the clue-writer's fault.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for the tangent, but the growing amorality and <br/>
"nothing-is-ever-my-fault" attitude of American society is a particular pet peeve of mine. I'm <br/>
sorry if I've irritated anyone, but I just had to say it.<br/>

If you are going to do this, I think it would be wise to develop a mental <br/>
rating as well (or a combined rating).  The mental difficulty of the clues <br/>
will prolly add a multiplicitive factor to the physical difficulty of the <br/>
hike (e.g., for getting lost, taking time to puzzle it out, lets just walk <br/>
down this trail and have a look for the "green monster", etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Put another way, straightforward directions thru a 2 mile trail network<br/>
will be less physically taxing than cryptic directions over the same path.<br/>
<br/>
I think some letterboxers make the mistake of underestimating this <br/>
multiplicitive effect when planning a hike.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would like to respond to this if I may.  I am legally blind, I <br/>
letterbox, and I usually take my children with me.  My father (passed <br/>
way two years ago) was a quadriplegic for 30+ years, and I usually <br/>
took him everywhere I could.  I think I may have a good perspective <br/>
for you.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Fully Accessible<br/>
&gt; Open to all ages including early walkers and those in wheelchairs. <br/>
Distance<br/>
&gt; can be covered at a walking pace of 2+ miles per hour with no or <br/>
almost no<br/>

&gt; suitable for wheeled transportation (strollers, walkers, <br/>
wheelchairs) and is<br/>
&gt; safe for the visually impaired.<br/>
<br/>
Question - are there guardrails or such to prevent tipovers?  If <br/>
there are, that would be a useful bit of information.  I would <br/>
attempt this box with my father in a wheelchair, and I would bring <br/>
along my 5 year old.  I don't know if the mph information would be <br/>
relevant, since everyone travels at a different pace.  But I do get <br/>
the point.  Perhaps a different qualifier would serve better.  Let me <br/>
think about that one for a while.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Very Easy<br/>
&gt; Open to all ages including early walkers. Distance can be covered <br/>
at a<br/>
&gt; walking pace of 2+ miles per hour with no or almost no inclines of <br/>
more than<br/>

walkers and<br/>
&gt; light strollers may have difficulty. Trail safe for visually <br/>

<br/>
Okay, you've given some caveats that I completely understand and can <br/>
make a judgement call based on what you've written.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Easy<br/>
&gt; Open to all ages including early walkers. Distance can be covered <br/>
at a<br/>
&gt; walking pace of 1.5 to 2 miles per hour with no inclines of greater <br/>
than 200<br/>
&gt; feet. Trail suitable for large wheeled transportation but walkers <br/>
and light<br/>
&gt; strollers may have difficulty. Trail safe for visually impaired with<br/>
&gt; assistance.<br/>
<br/>
Your qualifier of mph now starts to make more sense.  The first <br/>
designation of 2 mph was a benchmark.  So was the incline rate.  <br/>
Okay.  I can now extrapolate.  This is good.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Moderate<br/>
&gt; Open to strong walkers or babies in carriers. Distance can be <br/>
covered at a<br/>
&gt; walking pace of 1 to 1.5 miles per hour with no inclines of greater <br/>
than 400<br/>
&gt; feet. Trail may not be suitable for wheeled transportation or the <br/>
visually<br/>
&gt; impaired. Box is accessible to children.<br/>
<br/>
Question here - children of what age? 2? 11? A range of age would be <br/>
helpful here.  I would attempt this box with my 12 year old who is <br/>
trained as my guide, but would I attempt this box with my 5 year old?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Difficult<br/>
&gt; Open to experienced walkers or babies in carriers. Distance can be <br/>

&gt; at a walking pace of 1 mile per hour average with some climbing <br/>
involved.<br/>
&gt; Trail not suitable for wheeled transportation or the visually <br/>
impaired. Box<br/>
&gt; may or may not be accessible to children.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - stern warnings.  I would not attempt this box unless I was <br/>
with an experienced letterboxing adult and I definitely would not <br/>
take *any* of my children.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Challenging<br/>
&gt; For experienced older walkers. Distance covered at an average pace <br/>
under 1<br/>
&gt; mile per hour or with many climbing segments or with the inclusion <br/>
of off<br/>

young,<br/>
&gt; wheeled transportation, visually impaired and care should be take <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; mentally challenged. Box most likely not accessible to children.<br/>
<br/>
Define "older" walkers.  "Care should be taken with mentally <br/>
challenged" assumes that the person is accompanied by a non-mentally <br/>
challenged person.  Perhaps that should be in there.  And your <br/>
qualifiers allow me extrapolate further.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Extreme<br/>
&gt; Not recommended for walkers under the age of 10 and then only with <br/>

That one is plain and simple.<br/>

I agree - we've mistakenly searched under the wrong tree countless times<br/>
because what looks like an obvious spot to one person, doesn't to another. I<br/>
wouldn't mind seeing such a thing included in the rating system being tested<br/>
on the site.<br/>

they are designed for other kids :)<br/>

He does have an introductory section which explains how the "average"<br/>
five-year-old with no physical limitations can generally cover flat ground,<br/>

upon a five-year-old going at a sidewalk pace of 2 mph. I keep trying to<br/>

<br/>
We had a few discussions about creating another level where it just includes<br/>
paths with guardrails or similar protective factors. In the end, the<br/>
decision came to not have two levels and to include with any listing for the<br/>
"fully accessible" level details on how that was decided - terrain type,<br/>
guardrails, notations if alternate paths are needed to use wheelchair ramps,<br/>
etc. While out hunting today, we came across the first box we'd list as<br/>
fully accessible, had we planted it. Sidewalks, guardrails on the incline<br/>
bridge, handicapped parking three feet from where the box actually is<br/>
located.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Question here - children of what age? 2? 11? A range of age would be<br/>
helpful here.  I would attempt this box with my 12 year old who is<br/>
trained as my guide, but would I attempt this box with my 5 year old?<br/>
<br/>
Good point! I will let him know that he should better qualify ages rather<br/>
than using the general terms he has :)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Define "older" walkers.  "Care should be taken with mentally<br/>
challenged" assumes that the person is accompanied by a non-mentally<br/>
challenged person.  Perhaps that should be in there.<br/>
<br/>
Another good point! He made an assumption that the only mentally challenged<br/>
people seeking boxes would always have someone with them, as is the case<br/>
with the kids he knows. But of course adults with challenges may be looking<br/>
for the boxes. I'll bring this up and have him figure out a way to include<br/>
"needs assistance" and "fine without assistance" or something similar.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I hope this was helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Very much! Thank you Warrior Woman :)<br/>

&gt; He does have an introductory section which explains how the "average"<br/>
&gt; five-year-old with no physical limitations can generally cover flat ground,<br/>
&gt; such as a sidewalk, at a rate of 2-3 mph and all speed ratings are based<br/>
&gt; upon a five-year-old going at a sidewalk pace of 2 mph.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A-ha! okay, much better! Now it all comes together. I would still like to see <br/>
an overall approximate distance in each category (just like in the "Extreme" <br/>
category), but now I DO think you should leave the speed factor in there. It <br/>
works! :-)<br/>

I like that idea as well, give people an idea how long they'll be walking at<br/>
2mph or whatever. Thanks :)<br/>
