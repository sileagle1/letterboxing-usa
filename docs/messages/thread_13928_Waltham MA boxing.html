                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks. My husband and I went boxing yesterday and we found two from Team Green Dragon. They were the Paine Estate Box and the Waverly Oaks Park Box. Btw, if you're hunting the Waverly Oaks Park box, beware the huge, and I do mean HUGE!, patches of poison ivy. It's everywhere. We almost couldn't get to the box but Tom was brave and waded in without brushing the poison ivy! Good man! We'll have to return to the Paine Estate and walk the rest of the trails. It's a lovely spot. Thanks!<br/>
