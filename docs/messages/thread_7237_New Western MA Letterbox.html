Massachusetts, just in time for Labor Day letterboxing.  The clue follows.<br/>
It is also available at http://users.crocker.com/~bsennott/goodnoughdike.html<br/>
<br/>
Note to Webmaster:  This is in Worcester County.  On a map, it's just above<br/>
Hampshire County on the east (Ware) side of the Quabbin.<br/>
<br/>
Quabbin Reservoir/Goodnough Dike Letterbox<br/>
Ware, Massachusetts<br/>
<br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY:  Easy<br/>
TERRAIN:  Easy--An easy walk on paved roads and an uphill (but not<br/>
strenuous) hike on broad, well-marked trails. The entire walk, from car to<br/>
letterbox and back again, takes about an hour.<br/>
ESTABLISHED: August 27, 2002<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  From Route 9, whether coming from the east or the west, enter<br/>
the Quabbin at the entrance located directly across the road from the<br/>
Quabbin Park Cemetery.  If you are coming from Amherst, Northampton, or<br/>
other points west, this is the third entrance to the Quabbin, immediately<br/>
following the Monson Turnpike in Ware.  Enter the park and drive about a<br/>
quarter mile until you see the small green signs for the Goodnough Dike.<br/>
Park along this triangular driveway. <br/>
<br/>
CLUE: Walk around the yellow gate and follow the paved road.  Just up<br/>
ahead, at a 25-mile-an-hour sign, this paved road forks.  Go left.  It will<br/>
lead you to the water and the Goodnough Dike.  Cross the dike and locate<br/>
Quabbin Gate 50, on the eastern end of the dike.  <br/>
<br/>
Take the trail at Gate 50 into the woods.  This wide and somewhat rocky<br/>
trail climbs gently uphill; the reservoir is on your left.  In about five<br/>
minutes you will pass the remains of an old stone wall, which is visible on<br/>
both sides of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
In another 5-10 minutes you will enter a cool hemlock woods and will see a<br/>
stone wall about 100 yards off the trail to your right.  Some trees in this<br/>
vicinity are marked with yellow blazes.  Soon youll exit the hemlock woods<br/>
and enter a sunnier mixed-growth forest with some very tall pine trees.<br/>
The trail becomes quite sandy.  Then, it curves to the right and becomes<br/>
rockier.  Once again, theres a stone wall on each side of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Then the trail curves to the left.  In a few more minutes youll come to a<br/>
T intersection.  Go left (north).  As before, theres a stone wall on each<br/>
side of the trail.  In a couple of minutes, you will see a third stone wall<br/>
farther off, on the right.  Remaining on the trail, walk to the spot where<br/>
the two stone walls on the right converge, forming a triangle.  A young<br/>
maple tree grows at that spot.  Stand next to the maple and do an about<br/>
face.  Walk approximately 14 paces back in the direction you came from and<br/>
look to your right (west).  About 8 paces off the trail, theres a cluster<br/>
of boulders next to a small maple tree.  One of these boulders juts up into<br/>
the air at an angle, pointing east (toward the trail).  Beyond the cluster<br/>
of boulders is another stone wall.<br/>
<br/>
Walk off the trail to these boulders, stand at the maple tree, and look<br/>
down into the crevice at the base of the boulders.  Voila!<br/>
<br/>
Please rehide the letterbox well.  It does not contain a stamp pad, so be<br/>
sure to bring your own.  <br/>
<br/>
There are souvenir photographs of the view from Goodnough Dike for the<br/>
first three people who find this letterbox.  They are small enough to paste<br/>
into your logbook.  Good luck!<br/>
