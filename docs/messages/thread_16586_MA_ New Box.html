that we have created.<br/>

We placed this letterbox in honor of our second anniversary together. We met <br/>
on a blind date and our first date was a hike at Doanes Falls.<br/>
Doanes Falls is owned by The Trustees of Reservations. This is where the <br/>
Lawrence brook falls almost 200 feet in a series of spectacular falls <br/>
towards Tully Lake. Tully Lake is a part on the Army Corps of Engineers <br/>
flood control project. When there is a lot of rainfall or snow melt, they <br/>
close the dam and flood the land above it to prevent flooding of the <br/>
Connecticut River. At Tully Lake there is a recreation area where you can <br/>
picnic, fish, hike, BBQ, and go boating. There is also a campground on the <br/>
lake.<br/>
To get to Doanes Falls, start at the center of Athol, Ma. Go east on Rt. 2A <br/>
east onto Rt. 32 North. Follow Rt. 32 north for about 10 minutes and you <br/>
will come to Tully Lake on your right. Go past Tully Lake and the picnic <br/>
area. Take the next right onto Doane Hill Rd. Follow this road until it <br/>
comes to an end at an intersection. Look to your right and you will see a <br/>
small parking area with a Trustees of Reservations sign. Park here.<br/>
<br/>
Walk along the brook on the yellow blaze trail. Watch your footing on the <br/>
rocks and roots. Stay on the yellow blaze trail. After the trail turns right <br/>
(away from the brook), look for a stone wall on both sides of the trail. <br/>
Stop before going through the opening in the wall. Standing before the <br/>
opening, look right and you will see where the wall makes a T. Look in the <br/>
right inside corner to find the letterbox. After stamping in, return to your <br/>
car the same way that you came.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have fun.<br/>
