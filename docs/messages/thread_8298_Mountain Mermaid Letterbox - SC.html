Jones Gap State Park<br/>
Greenville County, South Carolina<br/>
Near Greenville<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:<br/>
<br/>
Clues easy to moderate.  Trail easy walk with some<br/>
more challenging climbs near the end.  Total loop from<br/>
car park is about  mile.<br/>
<br/>
Notes about Jones Gap State Park:<br/>
<br/>
The park is located north of Greenville, South<br/>
Carolina, off of US 276.  Proceed through Travelers<br/>
Rest on US 276 and follow the signs.  When you get to<br/>
Cleveland, youre getting close.  Mind the signs, as<br/>
you will turn off of US 276 to the right.  The park is<br/>
busy on weekends, and parking is free but limited. <br/>
During busy times, a park ranger will close the road<br/>
and turn away cars when the car park is full.  Bring a<br/>
lunchits a nice spot for a picnic.<br/>
<br/>
The Mermaids Progress:<br/>
<br/>
The Mountain Mermaid crawled out of the Middle Saluda<br/>
River where she had been living for as long as she<br/>
could remember.  She had no idea what would possess<br/>
her to leave the watery home that she had always<br/>
enjoyed.  The river and its tributaries offered her<br/>
countless opportunities for exploration, but she found<br/>
herself weary of the limited scenery and wondered what<br/>
life was like among the legged creatures she saw<br/>
running about in the parks through which the river<br/>
threaded its way.<br/>
<br/>
She emerged from the river underneath a footbridge<br/>
that she had seen numerous land creatures cross over<br/>
the years.  She did not appreciate that she had been<br/>
fortunate enough to grow up in a state park.  In her<br/>
nave mind, the entire world was such a bounty of<br/>
nature.  Despite the foreign surfaces (fortunately,<br/>
the river had nothing like the asphalt pavements) she<br/>
found that she could drag herself along without a<br/>
great deal of discomfort, especially by staying under<br/>
the trees and their fallen leaves and needles.  Not<br/>
much different, really, from scampering across the<br/>
rocks and boulders in the river, except she missed the<br/>
smoothness of the intermittent patches of moss.<br/>
<br/>
She soon came to a moderately sized pool of water. <br/>
Land creatures had built this pool as a living area<br/>
for mountain trout.  She slipped in one end and out<br/>
the other to cool herself.  Beyond the pool and<br/>
farther on the path was what appeared to be a large<br/>
dwelling on the right (she wouldnt have understood<br/>
the concept of a visitors center).  She thought about<br/>
exploring the large log building but decided to stay<br/>
close to the river in case she grew fearful and needed<br/>
to retreat to more familiar territory.<br/>
<br/>
She came to a wide bridge that crossed the river. <br/>
After crossing the bridge, she saw a sea of the same<br/>
rough black material with large, wheeled vehicles<br/>
arranged in rows.  To the right was what appeared to<br/>
be a trail or path, covered in some of the sand that<br/>
she was accustomed to on the river bottom.  A sign<br/>
read JONES GAP TRAIL, but that meant nothing to the<br/>
illiterate mermaid.<br/>
<br/>
She began crawling up the trail and, before long, came<br/>
to another sign similar to the one she had seen before<br/>
and a new trail branching off to the left.  She felt<br/>
she should go up this alternative path, even though<br/>
the signs lettering, RIM OF THE GAP TRAIL, gave her<br/>
no indication of what lay ahead.  She carried on up<br/>
this new path, somewhat concerned that it took her<br/>
away from the river that, to her, represented safety.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly something in the signs message meant that<br/>
this way was to be strenuous.  The path quickly turned<br/>
uphill, crossing log steps that challenged her ability<br/>
to pull herself along.  She came to a large log that<br/>
had fallen across the path.  In the river, such a log<br/>
would have not been a significant barrier, but here,<br/>
on the leaf-strewn, dry path, it proved to be a more<br/>
formidable challenge.  Someone had carved a<br/>
crosshatched pattern in the top of the log, which<br/>
scratched her painfully as she dragged herself across.<br/>
<br/>
She soon reached a slight crest in the path and began<br/>
to descend slightly.  The slope helped her rest<br/>
somewhat from her struggle, and near the bottom she<br/>
noticed that she could again see over to the left the<br/>
river and the bridge she had crossed earlier.  The<br/>
sight of the water comforted her and spurred her to<br/>
continue farther on.<br/>
<br/>
Ahead of her on the path was a large rock, and the<br/>
path wound around the left side.  After passing the<br/>
rock, she came to what appeared to be a fork in the<br/>
path.  The fork would have been about seven long steps<br/>
away for one of those legged creatures, she thought. <br/>
She turned to the right, climbed a slight hill<br/>
(perhaps another 13 long steps or so) and noticed<br/>
ahead of her the largest rock she had ever seen. <br/>
Almost as big as the dwelling she had seen earlier, it<br/>
was pointed, not unlike a huge version of her own<br/>
nose, with the point resting on a smaller yet still<br/>
enormous rock underneath.  It seemed to point over her<br/>
right shoulder, toward the river and downstream.  She<br/>
simply had to explore this phenomenon further.  There<br/>
were certainly no rocks like this in the river.<br/>
<br/>
She came to the base of the rock and saw that she<br/>
could pass underneath the point of the nose to the<br/>
right of the rock on which it rested and then up<br/>
around the right side of it.  This proved to be a very<br/>
strenuous exercise, and she frequently had to use her<br/>
entire body to brace herself as she pulled herself up<br/>
over the big boulders.  She made her way to what she<br/>
termed the back of the big rock, opposite the<br/>
pointed end.  She noticed a tree growing up beside the<br/>
big rock that touched the rock about eight feet up and<br/>
had begun to grow around the rock as if to swallow it<br/>
into itself.<br/>
<br/>
She took a closer look at the tree and then rested her<br/>
back against the rock there.  Darkness was beginning<br/>
to fall, and she realised that she needed to find<br/>
shelter and get some rest from her labour.  She looked<br/>
to the north (had she a compass, she would have known<br/>
more precisely that her gaze fell at 330) and noticed<br/>
two rocks between which she could walk, almost like a<br/>
narrow gate.  These rocks were about 8-10 meters away<br/>
from the tree, and she made her way to them.<br/>
<br/>
Perched in the gap between the rocks, she proceeded<br/>
through and slowly down a slight incline, turning to<br/>
the right and making her way through young<br/>
rhododendron to the underside of the bigger rock that<br/>
had been on her right as she passed through the gap. <br/>
She saw that this bigger rock overhung the hill so as<br/>
to create a small cave beneath it.  She crawled under<br/>
the rock, tucked herself up under it as far to the<br/>
right as she could get and fell asleep.<br/>
