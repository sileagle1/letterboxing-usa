thinking about trying out these boxes--we think they<br/>
are MIA.<br/>
<br/>
First tried the Clark Point Light Letterbox in New<br/>
Bedford, MA planted by Lonemasswolf and You Inspire My<br/>
Spirit.  We were fairly certain we were in the correct<br/>
spot yet the letterbox eluded us.  Has anyone logged<br/>
into this box lately?  <br/>
<br/>
Second stop of the day was Ned's Point Lighthouse<br/>
Letterbox in Mattapoisett, Massachusetts, planted<br/>
again by Lonemasswolf.  Either their were some serious<br/>
problems with the bearings on this one or we've both<br/>
forgotten how to use our compasses.  Following the<br/>
directions written led us only to the middle of the<br/>
parking lot.  We tried a few other variations and<br/>
likely places but only ended up with a geocache (hey,<br/>
that's a first for both of us!lol).  Again- has this<br/>
one been found lately??<br/>
<br/>
Third stop on this windy, rainy day took us to Nobska<br/>
Point Light Letterbox in Woods Hole.  These directions<br/>
were so good we thought it was a sure bet, that<br/>
there's no way we could get this one wrong.  Strangely<br/>
enough, it, too, was missing!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say we were two very disappointed<br/>
letterboxers. :o(<br/>
<br/>
We did get a chance to happen upon the road taking us<br/>
to the Knob...dumb luck or someone was feeling sorry<br/>
for us.  Great place to explore.  No orcas there but<br/>
the stamp was right where it was supposed to be.  We<br/>
figured we'd stop on a good note. (minus getting lost<br/>
on the way home...where exactly does 195 split from<br/>
495???)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any clues about the MIA boxes please post!<br/>
