                    <div class="plaintext-content">Has anyone visited this LB? We took a shortcut because we had hiked <br/>
the trail earlier that day. I'm absolutely positive we were in the <br/>
correct spot. Some of the last clues direct you to a specific tree, <br/>
and we could not figure out which one. Can anyone give us a hint? (I <br/>
e-mailed the placers, and have not heard back yet.)<br/>
<br/>
We might have been in the correct spot because we found a plastic bag <br/>
in a location where there should not have been one, but I'm not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Not finding this one was especially disappointing because I had two 9-<br/>
year-olds with me, and they were very excited about finding the box. <br/>
For one, it was his first box.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated!<br/>
