Well George Bush is making it easier for us to<br/>
letterbox by cutting down all the tree that are in the<br/>
way of us getting to the letterboxes. So now we can<br/>
see them and find them faster. THIS IS JUST A JOKE<br/>

 I couldn't agree with you more funhog! I think the "healthy forest<br/>
initiative" is absurd, and devastating to our forests. I received a<br/>
private email from someone who I believe misinterpretted my earlier<br/>
comment.<br/>
<br/>
"at least with no trees we no<br/>
longer have to worry about our boxes melting in a forest fire" Sniff<br/>
sniff, can you smell the sarcasm.<br/>
I am not one to usually talk politics, but there is "thinning" and<br/>
then there is "logging", and there seems to be too much of all of it<br/>
Leave my trees alone<br/>
