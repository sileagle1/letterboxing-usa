Placed: September 7, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Headlands Beach State Park, Mentor, Ohio<br/>
Lake County<br/>
Nearest Big City: Cleveland<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy - you will need a compass.<br/>
<br/>
Headlands Beach State Park is located on Route 44, east of Cleveland.  Take <br/>
Route 2 East from Cleveland to Route 44 North.  Head north on Route 44 until <br/>
the road ends at the Park entrance.  <br/>
<br/>
Go straight into the Park and take the first left hand turn.  The Park road <br/>
travels along the edge of a series of parking lots.  Park in Lot P-16.  <br/>
Across the street from the parking lot, opposite the beach side of the lot, <br/>
is a maintenance road.  Follow the maintenance road for a short distance <br/>
until you see a sign for a cross country ski trail posted on a utility pole <br/>
on the left side of the road.  Follow the ski trail.<br/>
<br/>
You will pass a wooden bridge with metal railings on the right side of the <br/>
trail.  There will be a series of utility poles on the left side of the <br/>
trail.  Further down the trail, there will be a utility pole straight ahead <br/>
of you, and the path will go to the left.  The bull-rushes on both sides of <br/>
the trail will stop and the trail will go into the woods.  Just where the <br/>
bull-rushes stop, there is a clearing and a tree on the right side of the <br/>
trail.  <br/>
