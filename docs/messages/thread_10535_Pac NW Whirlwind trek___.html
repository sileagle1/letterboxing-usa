                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just went on a whirlwind (should I say whirlpool instead since it <br/>
rained most of the time?) trek around the Pacific NW--here's the <br/>
status on several boxes we attempted for all those letterbox placers <br/>
out there:<br/>
<br/>
28 Jan 03:<br/>
Alaska Bound: alive &amp; well<br/>
Tundra Traveler: alive &amp; well<br/>
Sleight:  alive &amp; well<br/>
Tualatin Nature Park series:  #2, #4 alive &amp; well (others either <br/>
closed due to trails being closed or we weren't able to reach <br/>
because we ran out of daylight), looks like #1 is definitely missing<br/>
<br/>
29 Jan 03:<br/>
Bush Park (Salem): alive &amp; well<br/>
Minto-Brown Island: trail closed due to high water (didn't have high <br/>
enough waders to make it through the 3' of water supposedly on the <br/>
trail at the time &amp; the kids can't swim yet so we'll save it for a <br/>
later attempt)  ;)<br/>
Sunday in the Park with George (Salem): vandalized only found a pen <br/>
&amp; stamp for #1 (since it was a sequential series, couldn't get to <br/>
the other 2 boxes to see how they fared)<br/>
<br/>
30 Jan 03:<br/>
Lost (is no longer lost!!!):  alive &amp; hanging in there (stamp has <br/>
lost its question mark, though)--great box, found it without a <br/>
street map...don't ask me how!  ;)<br/>
Who Let the Dogs Out series: alive &amp; well (#2 was visible to all but <br/>
we covered it quite thoroughly when we were through--many notes in <br/>
the log from non-letterboxers--some even mentioned that they thought <br/>
it was a 'weed drop'--wonder what was on their minds at the time <br/>
when they read through the log, were they disappointed that it was <br/>
just a letterbox?) ;)<br/>
World's Crappiest:  just as crappy as ever and alive &amp; well, thanks <br/>
Ryan--it really wasn't that crappy, in fact, it was sort of cute!!!<br/>
Goofy Pub Names:  Found 1, 2, 3 &amp; 5 and all were alive &amp; well (not <br/>
sure what the deal with #4 is--never found the log referenced in the <br/>
clues--it was raining torrentially at that point and almost dusk, <br/>
after searching 6 different logs and when our clue sheet started to <br/>
disintegrate, we gave up--looks like some other folks had the same <br/>
problem)<br/>
<br/>
Yet, again, no hitchhikers on this trek--guess we just don't have <br/>
that HH magnet like everybody else has around here...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
So, in a nutshell, we've barely scratched the surface of the <br/>
Portland area.  If something strange afoot references things of the <br/>
binary nature, then my master's degree will finally come in <br/>
handy!!!  (It would be about time after 7 years...)  ;)  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, all, for another great adventure through places previously <br/>
untouched by us!!!  We thoroughly enjoyed it!!!<br/>

At one time no one knew wh ether your master's degree would indeed be <br/>
useful in understanding things of an odd nature. Now however, <br/>
additionally, a very nice pro letterboxer knows but perhaps will not <br/>
reveal the knowledge, leaving it to the searcher of fun and fortune <br/>
to find out alone. Be assured that a certain archive of information <br/>
may be helpful in your quest as it contains clues, however oblique. <br/>
Be warned that if you are not careful, this information will be thy <br/>
bane.<br/>
<br/>
As for the thing which was sought in vane during your trek, clanging <br/>
sounds may help lead you to a great ruler of the harmonious nature <br/>
north and west in the same park where the bear uses the woods. Or <br/>
perhaps, being something of a transient, the noise maker has moved on.<br/>
