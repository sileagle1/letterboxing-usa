Hi R of J<br/>
Unfortunately I believe you are discussing this topic in the wrong <br/>
place. Maybe you should shift it over to a geocaching chat list. <br/>
Anyone reading this thread, on this list, is either a letterboxer or a <br/>
letterboxer/geocacher and realizes that stamps in letterboxes should <br/>
not be traded. At best if you are able to create an interest at a <br/>
geocaching list then maybe you might do some good, but the folks you <br/>
would reach are those that participate in their chat list. If their <br/>
chat list is anything like this one then you will only reach a very <br/>
small percent of those that participate in geocaching. The ones that <br/>
will read it already have been geocaching for some time and won't be <br/>
the newbies. The folks that need to understand won't be the folks <br/>
reading the thread.<br/>
New geocachers are like new letterboxers. In their eagerness to <br/>
collect another F, they forget stealth,forget to rehide well, and tend <br/>
to be a little self centered. They probably haven't read much about <br/>
what the heck they are doing, and just want to go out and find another <br/>
box or cache. If you do take this topic to a geocaching list, then I <br/>
wish you well.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't mind the thread continuing along these lines, R of JARS. ( I also fiddled with the subject line a little more ~ hope you don't mind.)  Really, I think the only way we can make things work better is to talk, even if we don't like what others have to say.  I hope more people join the discussion.  This is a letterboxer's talk list, though, so please don't let my slant make you feel that we are all against geocaching or geocachers. Stuff happens!  One individual's carelessness reflects on all of us. And I think there are quite a few regular or long-time boxers who cache as well. We are in good company.<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching is a lot of fun. There are scads more caches out there, and many are planted in places that I'm totally unaware were even there, just like letterboxes!  That's what makes me go out to get them. The GPS is a fun toy and sometimes I feel like I "get it."  Other times I still get all turned around waiting for the signals to catch up. Other times I think I'm just denser than the trees or clouds.  I actually find more caches intuitively or by working a radius and searching once I'm in the area than relying on the GPS. I think that maybe letterboxing requires more spidey sense and that's why I put my GPS in my pocket and take a good look around. I know how to do that better tan following the GPS. If I relied on exact coordinates to find them all I would have gone nuts and given up by now. <br/>
<br/>
I'm no great boxer, and I don't keep stats. For me, it's all about the neat places.  I revisit letterbox sites just to drink in the environment, and check to make sure boxes aren't showing.  To me, returning again and again to a spot to enjoy it but not leaving signs of my visit is the highest compliment I can pay the placer.<br/>
<br/>
Many caches around here have a cute twist in the name, a play on words.  Many have a theme. Most are thoughtfully placed.  Some are so well hidden it's amazing. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I've never done anything rude or bonehead when caching.  Some day maybe I'll plant a cache.  But like l'boxes, there are so many great ones out there to get already, I take a back seat to planting.  One of the best things about caching, once I learned that you don't HAVE to trade, is carrying so little with me. I don't need a stamp, ink pad, paper towels, etc., and I get the signing-in done quickly. It's easier to avoid detection. <br/>
<br/>
OOOPS!  I'm running on and on.  I hope some other boxers chime in.<br/>
