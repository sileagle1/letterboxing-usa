-----&gt;&gt;  South Sound Summer Letterbox Fest  &lt;&lt;-----<br/>
<br/>
Sat, 9 Aug 2003<br/>
1000-until you want to leave<br/>
Tumwater Historical Park<br/>
777 Simmons Rd SW<br/>
Tumwater, WA (Olympia area)<br/>
(directions to the park are at the end of this message)<br/>
<br/>
Meet other regional letterboxers, exchange signature stamps, get rid <br/>
of all of those 'unwanted' hitchhiker letterboxes, bring your house <br/>
hidden letterboxes that you just can't bare to part with, stamp into <br/>
Fudrick's awesome event stamp, exchange letterboxing/carving helpful <br/>
hints &amp; ideas.  Cap it all off with the exquisite potluck that will <br/>
likely ensue after all of the letterboxing festivities.  Don't <br/>
forget to bring the munchkins as there is a GREAT playground <br/>
nearby!  If you have a few folks who you've been dying to introduce <br/>
to letterboxing, bring them along, too!  I'm sure we can get them <br/>
hooked...<br/>
<br/>
POTLUCK--bring a dish &amp; drinks to share that would feed the folks in <br/>
your party <br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>

&gt; Since everyone will be at the Tumwater Historical Park on August <br/>
9th for the South Sound Summer Letterboxing Fest, thought some <br/>
directions might be useful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are NorthBound on I-5, you have the easy route.  Take Exit <br/>
103, Deschutes Parkway.  At the STOP sign, continue straight ahead.  <br/>
Go past the entrance to Tumwater Falls Park, you can stop by there <br/>
later.  You will pass the Boston Street Bridge (on the right) which <br/>
is closed for reconstruction.  You will take the next right, which <br/>
takes you into Tumwater Historical Park.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are SouthBound on I-5, it is a little more difficult, so we <br/>
will give you the scenic way.  Take Exit 104, which is US 101, <br/>
heading out to the coast.  Keep right, you will take the first exit, <br/>
Crosby Blvd/Cooper Point Rd/Capital AutoMall Drive. Turn right at <br/>
the light, turn right at the light (going on two sides of the <br/>
AM/PM).  You are on Lakeridge.  Take the second left (by Thurston <br/>
County Courthouse Building 4, the two story building with orange <br/>
panels under the windows).  You will head down hill after going by <br/>
the entrance to the Thurston County CourthouZ.  When you get to the <br/>
bottom of the hill, you are on Deschutes Parkway.  Turn right, go <br/>
under the Freeway, don't turn left onto I-5 NB, but turn left at the <br/>
second road, which takes you into the Tumwater Historical Park.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If all goes well, we will be loitering around the picnic tables by <br/>
the playground.  You can tell us by our ink-stained fingers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See you there!!!!<br/>
