One can only hope. I am sick of all the worthless posts on the list. What a total waste of my time. Funhog<br/>

Welcome Newbie!<br/>
<br/>
1. Isn't it cool? I have been to places I never would have seen without<br/>
boxing. I also have gone up hills (Rattlesnake Ledge, moderate my tush) I<br/>
would have never attempted if not for a box hidden there.<br/>
<br/>
2. Any war scars yet?<br/>
<br/>
3. Lots of nice people for sure. Letterboxing is certainly a way to meet new<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
4. Sense of humor, remember?<br/>
<br/>
5. Better yet, let's talk letterboxing instead?<br/>
<br/>
