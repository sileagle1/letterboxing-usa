As far as stamp quality goes, I (and I know others feel the same way) <br/>
would rather see a "bad" homemade stamp than a nice storebought. <br/>

So don't let your stamp quality bother you. As long as you are having <br/>
fun, who cares?<br/>

Don't construe anything I wrote as not liking the stamps - cool <br/>
stamps are still cool stamps. Also, sometimes easy clues and/or <br/>
easy/quick hikes are just what I'm looking for, esp. when there are <br/>
time constraints. So box desirability changes not just from person to <br/>
person, but also on the persons mood. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm of the same opinion here.  I tend to prefer homemade stamps to <br/>
professional ones but still have really enjoyed the hunts even if <br/>
they involved store bought stamps.  The stamp is really just <br/>
the 'icing on the cake' to the hunt--I absolutely love trying to <br/>
solve the clues aspect of it so I really don't care what the final <br/>
image is like--it's just neat to be able to find it.  I was already <br/>
a person who enjoyed outdoor adventures so the clues and the stamps <br/>
just added another element of excitement to my adventures around my <br/>
surroundings.  I've used the letterbox hunts as tools to help teach <br/>
my children many different skills that they otherwise would never <br/>
have been exposed to until much later in life (using a compass, <br/>
knowing their directions, identifying various types of trees, <br/>
locating specific types of animals/plants/berries/rocks--you name <br/>
it).<br/>
     My stamps are pretty lame, too.  However, I've noticed that <br/>
with time and practice my images are improving.  Each new box I put <br/>
out, I try to challenge myself with a little more difficult image.  <br/>
Creating the stamp is part of the process and can prove to be <br/>
exciting, too.  I've also used the process of 'researching' ideas <br/>
for placing boxes as a way to learn more history about my nearby <br/>
surroundings.  I've learned some truly fascinating things about my <br/>
area and I'll never look at the place in the same light again.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few thoughts.  See you on the trail...<br/>
