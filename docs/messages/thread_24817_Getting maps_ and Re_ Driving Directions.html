buy a map of a certain area, your local library will be able to get one for<br/>
you.  They may have to borrow it from another library, so allow plenty of time<br/>
(and maps are harder to borrow than books), but for those who prefer a map that<br/>
they can unfold and crawl around on rather than trying to keep track of things<br/>
on that little bitty screen while waiting forever for the next view to load,<br/>
this is a very nice option.  Not to mention some of those internet maps are not<br/>
as accurate as they should be -- remember when MapQuest was sending RVs down a<br/>
narrow dead-end road on the wrong side of the lake?<br/>
<br/>
In the debate over driving directions: For me the main use of driving<br/>
directions is to help me locate the destination on the map -- for instance it's<br/>
fairly easy to find I-5 on the map and follow it to where it crosses College<br/>
St., but if all I have is "Huntamer Park" it could be ANY freaking little green<br/>
dot on the map.  Once I find my "target," I work out my own route (in this case<br/>
it would be from the opposite direction), often involving public transportation<br/>
or bike trails.  I don't REQUIRE driving directions, but they often make the<br/>
mapwork easier.  (The same could be said of latitude and longitude, but more<br/>
maps are going to show I-5 and College St.  Back to the library...)<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth.<br/>

&gt;   I think many letterboxers tend to be map people.   Even if people don't<br/>
&gt; want to buy maps, though, the internet is a very powerful tool.<br/>
