<div>  Only Regret</div>

<div>     " Leaving home and 
going to Yale  to study  was ambitious and exciting. Our home was in 
the process of being enlarged to fit our family, and fathers status as Deacon in 
the community.  I have fond memories of hunting in the woods with my 
brother, of working on our farm, of family and of my preparation for  Yale 
with the Reverend Huntington who lived a few miles down the road. 
"</div>
<div>      Home was never 
seen again but is the place we all begin.   "My most famous words 
are often quoted,  <em>I  only regret that I have but one life to give 
for my country." </em> </div>
<div>    From my likeness by the flag 
go NE for 25 paces ( count every left foot as a pace)  At the intersection 
head due N to the end of the Holy Grove, there is a gate you may have to go 
around if not open today. A little down this country road there is a barway on 
the left . Enter the woods traveling SW.  </div>
<div>   Pass the intersection to the hay 
field at the Y bear right the road more traveled now going  S.   
Walk on and over a cement culvert at a deer watering pond with crystal clear 
water.   On to a clearing take the trail  West. </div>
<div>    At the Y go left over the 
wall of an  ancient farm field now grown to woods ,pass the muddy area with 
the rotted stump. A little further now to  the left you will find the stump 
a  lumberjack has left ,two stones sit atop and the tree lies rotting 
nearby. This is where in secret like a spy you stamp your message for the next 
passerby.  </div>
<div>     Now that your  
book is tallied one more ,in the woods we travel back to homes door.   
Follow that trail, watch for horses that pass. Keep on the trail to a large 
Y</div>
<div> bear left. You should be about 45 minutes 
into your walk so far.  </div>
<div>   Puddles to cross stay with the main 
trail now SE. </div>
<div>    Yet another fork in the 
trail  stay right, follow scratched rocks as you walk this clear trail . A 
sharp eye will note a boundry marker of stacked stones on the left</div>
<div>   At the  T in the trail  
go left , you're almost home  stay on straight now no turns to take.  
Along  the stonewall where corn grows in season , NW travel brings home in 
to view. Usually here a port a potty too, Whew! </div>
<div>   Back to the grounds , groomed and 
honored, in memory of  a son, a family, a farm, and the greatest deed of 
honor. </div>
<div>  " To drum beat and 
heartbeat</div>
<div> A soldier marches by:</div>
<div>There is color in his cheek,</div>
<div>There is courage in his eye</div>
<div>Yet to  drumbeat and heartbeat</div>
<div>In a moment he must die. " </div>
