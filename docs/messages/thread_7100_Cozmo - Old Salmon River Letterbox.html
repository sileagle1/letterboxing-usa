<div>
<div>Cozmo was my late dog of almost fourteen that I 
just recently had to let go due to old age.  This was the hardest 
thing I have ever done, making that choice for his sake.  Cozmo was my best 
friend and loyal companion and this letterbox is to commemorate his life 
and his love of hiking and the outdoors.  Cozmo hiked over 200 miles on the 
Pacific Crest Trail with me in one three week stint, and hiked 100's of other 
Oregon and NW  trails as well every year.  he even had his own 
backpack that I made just for him.  I loved him so so much, I miss him 
everyday.  he got to live a wonderful dog life, loving the outdoors and 
experiencing it to the fullest.  I had him since he was six weeks old, and 
he lived to almost be 14, which is quite a long time for a big boxer/German 
Shepard.</div></div>
<div>
<div> </div>
<div>Old Salmon River was Cozmo's last hike.  I want this 
box to live on at the Old Salmon River to commemorate his life, and I 
want Cozmo to be able to continue to hike through us via this 
letterbox.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have included a photo of Cozmo in this letterbox.  If 
you have had a dog in your life that has meant the world to you, please do not 
also hesitate to leave a picture of your dog in the box as well, with some 'in 
memory' info on the back.  Let all the dogs be remembered!  They were 
our best friends!  They are not forgotten~</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Directions. Take highway 26 east until you come to the Welches 
Grade School Rd., it is right before Zig Zag, on the right directly after 
the fire station.  Take this right and follow it until you enter the 
National Forest, there will be a sign.  Shortly after you will approach, on 
a curve, the trailhead for the Old Salmon River, 742A.  You want the very 
first MARKED trailhead for this trail.  If in doubt, bring along a book 
that has directions to get you to the Old Salmon River Trail, 742A.  You 
want to stop at the first marked trailhead you come to, it will be on a curve to 
the left, and the trailhead will be on the right.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clue 1:  you will hike for an undisclosed amount of time 
until you come upon a huge downed log that will be coming right out over the 
river, and at this point the river will get close to the trail.  The log 
has three large cuts in it that look as if someone was trying to chop it and 
then realized that that would be a longshot.  At this log you continue 
along the path as it bends back and takes a sharp left, almost backtracking, and 
you will see a staircase.  This is the only staircase on the hike.  If 
you have found it, you are in the right place.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clue 2: At the top of the staircase, directly and immediately 
to your left after you take a sharp right, parallel to the river and continue 
along the path, there will be a huge old growth tree that you can climb 
into.  it's obvious that you can....... Do so!  It's really 
fun!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clue 3:  After coming out of that tree and facing down 
the path in the same direction again, look ahead and up a little hill a very 
short distance you will see another HUGE old growth cedar tree, go to it.  
hug it.  hug it again.........!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clue 4: On the opposite side of the trail from this HUGE 
old growth cedar tree, there is another HUGE old growth cedar tree just off the 
beaten path.  there is a little path over to it, a sidepath, almost 
like a deer path.............follow it over to the second old growth 
cedar.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clue 5: Behind the second HUGE old growth tree there is 
another huge downed log.  this one has a large snag (dead tree) growing 
straight up out of it off to the left hand side.  Climb up onto this downed 
log.  the box is hidden here.  it is covered over with a large piece 
of wood, about 3 feet long with a big huge knot hole.  it is stashed under 
the knotted board of wood amongst a little meadow of quarter sized four leaf 
clover ground cover.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let the memory of Cozmo live on forever!   
</div>
