We just spent a beautiful Sunday late afternoon of letterboxing in Tobiasson <br/>
Memorial Forest in Tolland, CT.  I actually got the hubby to come, too!  All <br/>
4 boxes are there, however the books are very, very full.  Churchill or <br/>
Pinecone, if you check in you might want to replace them soon!  Thanks for a <br/>
really nice set of LBs.<br/>
<br/>
I got stung by a yellow jacket while coming back from the Shelter Falls box <br/>
on Wednesday.  I didn't see a hive or anything but I didn't stick around to <br/>
see either!  Possible a nest in the ground that was disturbed by Larry Boy <br/>
and Dino Boy tromping by.  They were very impressed that I didn't cry.  <br/>
We're very blessed that I got stung in the back of the leg and not Baby <br/>
Brother Bear sleeping in his backpack.  That would have been a nightmare!<br/>
<br/>
We also enjoyed the Bird Walk boxes in Storrs on Friday.  That was a nice <br/>
walk and the stamps are beautiful!!!  We are looking forward to Fall and <br/>
cooler weather for more comfortable letterboxing!<br/>
