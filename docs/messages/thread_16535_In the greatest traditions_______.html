<br/>
It seems that the great Pumpkin (You remember him, right? From the Peanuts comic strip.) has decided to prove Linus right once and for all. So, sometime between Halloween and Christmas he is going to turn everything he can find into pumpkins. Some scary, some not, some frightful, others not.  However, since the Great Pumpkin is a secretive sort, the pumpkins are going to be hidden in various and sundry places, with clues that would make the Great Karnack stumble in figuring them out. This way, the Great Pumpkin hopes, only those true to the belief of the Great Pumpkin will be able to find all of them!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Look for the clues on the main LBNa website and other places across the internet soon!<br/>
