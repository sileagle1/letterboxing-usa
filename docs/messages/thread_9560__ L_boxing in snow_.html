How are you able to stay on a trail? locate boxes off trail? Seems <br/>
like everything looks different or the same, whichever way you view <br/>
it. I LOVE the snow! Since this is our 1st winter L'boxing I'm a bit <br/>
hesitant on the approach. Seems I'm a bit accident prone. I'll <br/>
probably fall into a snow drift. After my mudbath episode, I see <br/>
danger at every turn.<br/>

<br/>
I'm an old hand at walking the trails in Connecticut.  They are in <br/>
the same places as they were in the summertime.  Locating boxes <br/>
under several inches of snow is another problem.  This is my first <br/>
winter l'boxing, and I probably will wait to see if the snow melts <br/>
in mid winter (or maybe not). Maybe I will curl up by the fire and <br/>
wait for spring.  We could trade l'boxing tails, tall or otherwise, <br/>
while we wait.<br/>
