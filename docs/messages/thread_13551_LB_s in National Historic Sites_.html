Since National Historic Sites are usually much smaller than National Parks or<br/>
Monuments you may have an easier time getting ahold of the site manager so you<br/>
could try asking but I am betting that the answer would be 'no'.<br/>

If the area is controlled by the National Park Service there will probably be prohibitions against leaving a letterbox on the property. If you do choose to violate "their" rules about "our" land, then your choice is mask the location in some creative way or face confiscation of the letterbox. They do have someone either checking our web site or as a regular receiver of the chat list (letterboxer?).  BTW has anyone seen my NPS Honorarium Hitch Hiker lately? Don<br/>

  Is it considered poor form (or maybe it's even illegal) to place a letterbox<br/>
  at a location that's designated as a "National Historic Site" ?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A feasible option for placing a box in properties such as this could <br/>
be to offset the actual location of the letterbox.  Your clues would <br/>
start at the location of interest, include a trek through the <br/>
region, require the letterboxer to observe various things along the <br/>
way--this info would then be compiled to answer questions that would <br/>
reveal the true 'offset' location of the letterbox's hiding spot <br/>
(located someplace off the property's grounds).  I can't imagine <br/>
that there would be any rule/law against setting up a letterbox clue <br/>
in this manner.  I've been trying to create a letterbox in this very <br/>
manner for a location quite near to our home.  Needless to say, it's <br/>
still brewing right now...<br/>
