It apparently stalled out somewhere in Ohio ? My feeling about that HH or any other HH or letterbox for that matter is that once you plant it or launch it you have no control . You only have a responsibility to keep it going or in the case of a letterbox to take care of it if it needs repair or putting in a new book if it needs it,even if it is some other letterboxer's box. If the HH gets lost in the shuffle ,gets stalled somewhere , goes missing , or is being passed along without notification don't worry about it - carve another stamp.  Don<br/>

Your Honor Liberty HH is actually in MI now...  Franzsolo sent it up <br/>
to me just a bit ago and due to the weather here, I haven't had a <br/>
chance to replant it yet.  Was planning to follow up with you once I <br/>
did that.  But it is safe and sound...<br/>
