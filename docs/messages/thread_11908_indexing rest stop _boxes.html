I wonder if the webmasters could work up an access point based on  <br/>

&gt; Maryland I-95 Service Area Boxes by Cavalier Manor<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Letterboxes are supposed to be in a beautiful, interesting, or remote  <br/>
&gt; location. Although these service areas are none of the above, perhaps  <br/>
&gt; the Gas-n-Go and Pit Stop microboxes will make the I-95 drive a  <br/>
&gt; bit more bearable. Maybe eventually we can get whole chains of boxes  <br/>
&gt; going at rest stops throughout the country! There are two  one for  <br/>
&gt; the journey and one for the return.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The clues are straightforward to minimize suspicious wandering about  <br/>
&gt; and frustration for tired brains.<br/>

&gt; You can find this box from either the southbound or northbound sides  <br/>
&gt; of the rest stop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Find the white footprints and follow them. Some lead to the Batmobile.  <br/>
&gt; Others lead to a purple dinosaur (not Barney, thank goodness!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where the footprints end, you could go inside for a beverage and  <br/>
&gt; snack. But you seek a different type of refreshment  a nice view, a  <br/>
&gt; walk in the woods, a place to unkink the aches that come from a  <br/>
&gt; roadtrip  so instead you turn and go up the grassy hill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When you reach the highest picnic table, take a moment to enjoy the  <br/>
&gt; view (well, at least its better than staring at taillights). Then,  <br/>
&gt; turn to your left where you will see a little path into the woods.  <br/>
&gt; Your brief escape into the forest! After the path curves to the right,  <br/>
&gt; look for a larger tree with a stump beside it. Your treasure lies  <br/>
&gt; behind that stump.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Happy trails!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; You may want to get your icy or piping hot beverage before you begin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Begin your pit stop in front of the house facing the three flags. Take  <br/>
&gt; a moment to read the highlights of the Maryland Colony on the  <br/>
&gt; historical marker to your left. Turn right and go down the ramp. On  <br/>
&gt; the way, you can learn more about Maryland State history. Who knew pit  <br/>
&gt; stops could be so edifying?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the bottom of the ramp, turn left. Pretty soon youll be walking  <br/>
&gt; next to a brick wall. Follow it all the way to the end. This would be  <br/>
&gt; a good time to bring out that drink and have a seat under the big tree  <br/>
&gt; youll find. Your treasure is at the very end of the wall.<br/>
