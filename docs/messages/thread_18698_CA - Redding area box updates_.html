<br/>
Thought we'd post these updates on a bunch of boxes that 3/4 of Clan <br/>
Jiggs pickerd up on the 8th (Mom Jiggs is still recovering from her <br/>
latest bit of surgery (nothing major)).<br/>
<br/>
Riverside Rest  - it took some figuring out of the clues, but we <br/>
finally got it! Watch the nettles, though!<br/>
<br/>
Frog's Legs! What a great little park tucked away in the west end of <br/>
Redding! The kids had a chance to use the scooter and bike I had <br/>
conveniently put in the trunk (after all this time, I'm learning!!) <br/>
<br/>
Queen City Shasta - Box is in good shape. Makes sure you check for <br/>
spiders before putting your hand in the hole!  <br/>
<br/>
OUR MANY HATS series near Mt Lassen, <br/>
<br/>
Box #1 Subway Cave! Awesome spot! The kids loved it so much that we <br/>
had to go through it twice! Box was fine! (first visitor since Sep <br/>
03)<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 Hat Creek Lookout - fine. (first visitor since Sep 03)<br/>
<br/>
Box #3 Pacific Crest Trail - box was fine - although the bes were a <br/>
little perturbed that we sat right next to their hive! We took the <br/>
hint and moved without a sting! Box was again fine, but paces on the <br/>
last section of trail were off! (one visitor in Mar 04)<br/>
