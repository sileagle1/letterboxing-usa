Well, we are headed to visit DC this weekend. Hopefully we can fit in <br/>
a few boxes over the weekend. We are Amtracking it so we will have no <br/>
car. We aren't familiar with DC but it doesn't look like there are <br/>
many boxes within walking distance of the mall or the Metro stations <br/>
we plan to stop at. Can anyone give me a heads up? Thanks!<br/>

Try "boxing at night".  I don't want to give away any clues, but it is easy<br/>
walking distance from the metro.<br/>

I was in DC in late September and visited the Lion series. It's very <br/>
close to the Metro stop near the Zoo. Once you finish the series, <br/>
you will be in another part of town, but there is another Metro stop <br/>
pretty nearby. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time, as it got <br/>
dark on us and we had to miss one in the series because it was <br/>
further into the woods. I also visited the Teddy Microbox, but we <br/>
drove there on our way to the airport.<br/>
