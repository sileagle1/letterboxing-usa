I am new here, so probably should not be posting at all. However, <br/>
other lists I am on have no certain parameters for messages. Here it <br/>
seems so many resent certain types of messages. And apparently not <br/>
all who resent certain message topics resent the same topics. <br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry if new people apparently come and ask what PFX means. <br/>
Yes, everyone should read the FAQs and webring sites. I cant help it <br/>
if not all of us newbies do. Personally since I have been here, I <br/>
haven't seen that question asked. Some have asked what certain other <br/>
letters stood for in the series of letters and numbers after names, <br/>
but I haven't seen that (complete) information listed anywhere in my <br/>
reading. <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me if anyone wants this to be a living, growing, <br/>
thriving list, that newbies questions should be accepted in good <br/>
faith. Some say that many regulars have left the list previously. <br/>
Could it be because the bickering and such was just too aggravating? <br/>
I hope that few if any of the newbies will leave in discouragement, <br/>
or just quit posting at all. Honestly, since I am not sure what is <br/>
or isn't going to tick some people off, if I post it, I am really <br/>
hesitating to post anymore. I realize some of you here have more <br/>
important things to say, I guess, than the 'average letterboxer', <br/>
but if only the few who think their posts qualify post, how slow or <br/>
stale is this list going to get? <br/>
<br/>
I have asked questions since joining, although I have avoided (I <br/>
think!) anything that could be found in FAQs or elsewhere. I assumed <br/>
that newbies and questions would be welcome, as in most lists, but <br/>
just from reading on the first day here, I realized that I had <br/>
better watch my step or get 'mildly flamed' for not being 'up to <br/>
snuff'. However, I have had a couple of questions come to mind, but <br/>
since reading so much here in the last few days, NO WAY will I dare <br/>
to ask anything! <br/>
<br/>
I came back from my first boxing excursion today, eager to tell <br/>
about it, but I see from posts while I was gone that that is <br/>
probably not a good idea either. Goodness, will someone please let <br/>
me know exactly WHAT is okay to post here????? And if anything in my <br/>
previous (what... 8 or so????) posts was objectionable, please copy <br/>
it and email it to me, so I will know.<br/>

Welcome to letterboxing &amp; congratulations on your first find!!!<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to post to this board anything that is related to <br/>
letterboxing.  As long as you preface your post with the state or <br/>
region to which it pertains, then I don't think anyone would be <br/>
upset (this isn't necessary if the topic pertains to the entire <br/>
group at large).  As you've unfortunately noticed, the national list <br/>
gets a bit 'schizophrenic' every now &amp; then (this seems to be a <br/>
monthly occurence).  There are so many folks active in letterboxing <br/>
&amp; on this board that you'll never be able to please (or agree with) <br/>
EVERY SINGLE PERSON involved.  <br/>
<br/>
Humour &amp; sarcasm don't convey very well on this board--as evidenced <br/>
by the recent SITREP tirade.  If you opt to incorporate humour or <br/>
sarcasm, I recommend that it be surrounded by smilies/winks/whatever <br/>
emoticon will help convey your point.  I often incorporate dry <br/>
humour/sarcasm/underlying messages in my comments and occasionally <br/>
get 'sandblasted' for doing so--to each their own.  Don't let it get <br/>
you down!  It's a great hobby that will take you to places you <br/>
otherwise would never have known about!  Get out there, find some <br/>
boxes, place some boxes, meet some other boxers and get the kids <br/>
involved as much as possible.  Have a great time 'boxing &amp; we look <br/>
forward to seeing new letterboxes in Florida soon!!!<br/>
<br/>
I personally love to hear about other peoples' experiences in <br/>
letterboxing &amp; when the reports pertain to my letterboxes that I've <br/>
placed around the country, then I'm able to keep tabs on the current <br/>
status of the boxes that much better.  So, here's one more vote in <br/>
support of 'sitreps'.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet you along the letterboxing trail someday...<br/>

found her first post, sent 4 days after joining and you know what? Not<br/>
everyone is perfect. <br/>
<br/>
I say go ahead and post, if there are sourpusses out there who want to<br/>
control who is allowed to speak and what content is posted then let<br/>
them form a private group, oh, wait, that's email.<br/>
<br/>
So post away and lets hear about all your boxing adventures or sitreps<br/>

    Congratulations for expressing feeling which others, I'm sure, have <br/>
wanted to write. I believe the vast majority of LB's will reflect back <br/>
to when they were new, and will agree with what you have said. Then too, <br/>
there are a few who will hopefully recognize themselves in your words.<br/>
    It amazes me how some people can take three pages to express their <br/>
opinions and beliefs, but can only protest at having to write one short <br/>
sentence to explain what P, F &amp; X means. If  it has to be repeated from <br/>
time to time, SO WHAT!<br/>
    I, for one, appreciate what you've said. Please don't be "silent in <br/>
the future".<br/>
    I can't wait to read the mail this will generate. <teeheehee><br/>

Those are hugs, BTW...<br/>
<br/>
Please don't let anyone detract from your experience letterboxing or posting!  I hope you didn't think I was being harsh with you or any newbie at any time.  I try to add winkies and smilies when I'm kidding and when my sarcasm is so over-the-top that I assume others know that I'm joking.<br/>
<br/>
I hardly ever post here.  I have posted more in the last 2 weeks, I think, than since I first came here.  I pick and choose what I read when, and if, I have the time to do so.  I most often enjoy the posts I manage to read.<br/>
<br/>
Please continue to post!  And try to have a thick skin even if you are, by nature, a sweetheart.  Whenever a post doesn't sit well with me, I try to imagine that the writer is just kidding or comes off more abrasive than they intend or realize.  (I think sometimes I do just that.)<br/>
<br/>
Yours was a good post.  Well, for a newbie...    Please don't be Silent in the Future.  Unless someone important like, oh, a moderator, for instance, tells you to shut up.  ;-)    <as if.=""><br/>

it <br/>

&gt; Yes, everyone should read the FAQs and webring sites. I cant help <br/>
it <br/>

&gt; haven't seen that question asked. Some have asked what certain <br/>
other <br/>

&gt; but I haven't seen that (complete) information listed anywhere in <br/>
my <br/>

&gt; <br/>

&gt; Could it be because the bickering and such was just too <br/>
aggravating? <br/>
&gt; I hope that few if any of the newbies will leave in discouragement, <br/>
&gt; or just quit posting at all. Honestly, since I am not sure what is <br/>
&gt; or isn't going to tick some people off, if I post it, I am really <br/>
&gt; hesitating to post anymore. I realize some of you here have more <br/>

&gt; I have asked questions since joining, although I have avoided (I <br/>

assumed <br/>

&gt; just from reading on the first day here, I realized that I had <br/>
&gt; better watch my step or get 'mildly flamed' for not being 'up to <br/>

&gt; since reading so much here in the last few days, NO WAY will I dare <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I came back from my first boxing excursion today, eager to tell <br/>
&gt; about it, but I see from posts while I was gone that that is <br/>

First off let me say welcome to the board and to the Letterboxing community. <br/>
As with any community you have the welcome wagoniers  and of course your <br/>
crotchety old farts that will take exception with anything you post.<br/>
I remember first discovering LB and how exciting every new thing was and I <br/>
soon discovered not everyone shared my zeal for new discoveries on the <br/>
board.<br/>
It sometimes made me think twice about posting. I have however come to <br/>
realize, and you will too, that some folks posts I need to simply ignore, <br/>
sometimes things posted don't always sound as they are meant and much of <br/>
what is posted is meant in good natured poking fun at each other. You'll <br/>
figure out whats what......but don't let anyone stop you from sharing. It's <br/>
your board too!!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;    You can post what makes you happy. I tell stories of our hunts. I<br/>
&gt;don't care if it is of interest to anyone. It is a way to record an<br/>
&gt;event and I like to put it in a format that is something like a<br/>
