<br/>
We recently placed two letterboxes on San Juan island, Washington.  The<br/>
first two letterboxes to be placed on that island, if I'm not mistaken.<br/>
Here's the details:<br/>
<br/>
San Juan's First Letterbox<br/>
Lime Kiln Point State Park - also known as Whale Watching Park<br/>
Placed on August 2, 2002 by the Smiley family<br/>
San Juan Island, Washington state<br/>
Nearest town:  Roche Harbor/Friday Harbor<br/>
Trail:  easy<br/>
<br/>
You can get to this park from the ferry dock at Friday Harbor on San Juan<br/>
transit shuttle, on scooter,  bicycle, or by car.  It'd be best if you pack<br/>
a picnic &amp; drinks along with your binoculars, 'cuz you'll want to be sure to<br/>
stay awhile and watch the wildlife, including orca whales if you are lucky!<br/>
<br/>
Find the trailhead near the parking lot.  It's a loop trail with an<br/>
interpretive brochure available at the beginning of the trail.  Be sure to<br/>
enjoy the interpretive info &amp; stop along the coastline to watch for whales.<br/>
There are some tables along the way &amp; plenty of great rocks to perch on for<br/>
a comfortable sit.<br/>
<br/>
After you pass the whale watching area, enjoy the tide pools on the rocks!<br/>
<br/>
Stop at Lime Kiln lighthouse - if your timing is great, you may be right on<br/>
time for a ranger program on the resident orca whale pods!<br/>
<br/>
Leave the lighthouse on the concrete walkway.  When the trails split, take<br/>
the trail at 290 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Find a perfect spot for a rest and enjoy the gorgeous view.<br/>
<br/>
Line up sweet dreams with the madrona and douglas, then, while watching out<br/>
for the slippery cones, find a crack in the rocks and you'll find the<br/>
letterbox.  Be sure to send us one of the postcards so we'll know how it's<br/>
doing!<br/>
<br/>
