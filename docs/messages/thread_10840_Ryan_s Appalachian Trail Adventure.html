&gt; Over 2,000 miles from Georgia to Maine and through<br/>
&gt; 12 other states, on foot.  They say the elevation <br/>
&gt; gain of all the hills adds up to climbing Mt Everest<br/>
&gt; from sea level to the top 16 times!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But gosh, that's my next BIG adventure I'm thinking about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a really neat and ambitious venture Ryan!<br/>
<br/>
Being a lover of the northwoods, I have thought I would like to hike <br/>
the North Country Scenic Trail, or a substantial section of it.  The <br/>
NCT will cover about 4000 miles across 7 northern states (a large <br/>
part of which is in Michigan) when it is finished.  Since it will be <br/>
a few years yet before it is done, I have a while to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to following your travels, and just may learn a thing <br/>
or two to prepare me for my potential journey.<br/>

                    <html><body>Be sure to do a lot of planning and read several books while you are planning your adventure.  I am a former Boy Scout leader and have had one of my former Boy Scouts take the trip and walked the whole thing at one time.  He was gone over three months but had the time of his life.  You can do pieces at a time also.<br/>
