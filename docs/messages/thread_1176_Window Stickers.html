                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good Morning Everyone, I like the idea of window stickers too. My son<br/>
has them made for his race  car, so I have a source! Do we want the LBNA<br/>
'logo'?  That has my vote, but is there any copyright problems with<br/>
using it? Let's get a concensus on this and tentative #s, and I'll work<br/>
on a price for them if you'd like. Annie B from wish I could go<br/>
letterboxing instead of work right now CT<br/>

&gt; I second your motion Melissa! Stickers for car windows are a GREAT idea! Who to call though? Who can manufacture? We'll have to do some researching on that one.<br/>
