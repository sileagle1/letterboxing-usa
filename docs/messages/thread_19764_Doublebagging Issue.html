book, it is an old form of Japanese book binding, where a piece of wood is<br/>
used along the spine. I had cut off the pencil on both ends and drawn lines<br/>
on it. (To look like a carasoul pole). When I went to check on the book I<br/>
found someone had taken the rubber band off of the book, taken the pencil<br/>
out and sharpened it. My mistake for using an old pencil for the wood..<br/>
needless to say when I replace it, it won't be with another pencil.<br/>
