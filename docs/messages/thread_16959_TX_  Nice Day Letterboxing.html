                    <div class="plaintext-content">We decided to enjoy the Spring-like weather yesterday and<br/>
went to Varner-Hogg State Park to gather pecans before they<br/>
were all gone.  We managed to get two grocery bags full of<br/>
nice nuts and found Baby Bear's Hogg Pecans letterbox, too.<br/>
I found the "Mighty Oaks From Tiny Acorns Grow" Hitchhiker<br/>
appropriately hidden in the Pecan box and will release it<br/>
soon.  We then ate a picnic lunch and headed for the Sea Center<br/>
in Lake Jackson.  After viewing the many free aquariums<br/>
I placed my "Gordon Grouper" microbox and we headed home.<br/>
If you live in the Houston/Galveston area, I highly recommend<br/>
that you visit these places soon.  Not only were they fun, but<br/>
they were FREE.  As extra incentive, I left a surprise in one<br/>
of the boxes for the first person to find, so get out there<br/>
and enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like y'all had a wonderful day!<br/>
<br/>
We are getting ready to head from Cherokee County down<br/>
to Enchanted Rock.  We take Hwy 79 straight to Austin,<br/>
then cut across to Fredericksburg to get there.  There<br/>
doesn't seem to be many boxes along that route, but we<br/>
will be returning by way of Highway 21 and there are<br/>
about 11 along that route. <br/>
<br/>
Hubby assumes me the goal of this trip is to<br/>
appreciate Enchanted Rock, but if I have my guess,<br/>
he'll get so much into boxing, that we'll come home<br/>
with all 11!<br/>

I am headed that way myself over Thanksgiving.  Hope to<br/>
find some boxes in San Antonio/Austin area also.  I will<br/>
be placing one at Enchanted Rock and other places, too,<br/>
but probably too late for you to get them.  Have fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very cool!  We are planning on leaving Wednesday<br/>
evening for Enchanted Rock.  I imagine we'll spend<br/>
most of the day there, then head - well, I don't know<br/>
where we're gonna head.  We don't have to be home<br/>
until late Sunday evening, so we may return up Highway<br/>
21, or we may hang out around Austin.  Reckon there is<br/>
any chance we'll bump into each other?<br/>
