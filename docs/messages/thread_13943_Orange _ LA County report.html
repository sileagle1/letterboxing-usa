                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just finished a weeklong trip to Anaheim and was able to squeeze in a bit <br/>
of time to log a few finds with some letterboxing compatriots.<br/>
<br/>
Turtle McQ and I found the Marina Pacifica Plumbing Problem and the Naples <br/>
Canal Conundrum boxes in Long Beach, and even met the planters, Chowder and <br/>
his humans, while we were stamping in at the fountain!<br/>
<br/>
Then, RichBeau and I logged the Easter Bunny in Fullerton, the first of the <br/>
Strange Stamps Series in Santa Fe Springs (#2 was out for repairs and #3 is <br/>
missing, we believe), and all three in the Lizard Crossing series in Whittier.<br/>
<br/>
All of the above stamps were particularly nice, I thought!<br/>
<br/>
We weren't able to find the West Wetlands in Long Beach, but it was after <br/>
dark so we just may have missed it. We did enjoy our short visit to the <br/>
large craft that's in the neighborhood, too.<br/>
