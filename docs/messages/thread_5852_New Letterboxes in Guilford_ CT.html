<br/>
Four letterboxes on a pleasant woodland trail  under one hour <br/>
for the loop!<br/>
Location: Off Route 80 on the Guilford/Madison line.<br/>
Planted June 23, 2002 by Bluebird.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: This opening to Guilford's Timberland Trails lies on <br/>
Route 80, 2.3 miles from the 80/79 circle in North Madison, and <br/>
a little over 2 miles from the 80/77 intersection in Guilford. <br/>
Coming east from the Guilford side you pass Maple Hills Road <br/>
on your right and it's on the right a little beyond that just before a <br/>
large boulder! Coming from the Madison direction it's on your left <br/>
soon after you pass Twin Bridge Road on your left  opening is a <br/>
bit hidden from that direction. You'll spot a parking area, trash <br/>
barrel and violet trail blazes. Town Hall has an excellent trail map <br/>
for this system  may be helpful as you hunt for 2 other sets of <br/>
boxes that other letterboxers have planted near other openings.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the violet, that's the way.<br/>
A hour or less is all you'll stay.<br/>
So try Timberland Trails and the Hideout boxes,<br/>
This very same day!<br/>
<br/>
Head into the timberlands on the violet trail. Pass by the white <br/>
cross-trail  you'll use that to loop back here later.<br/>
<br/>
A short way up you will note a split rock on your left; you may not <br/>
see it until you are level with it, so keep a sharp lookout. Look <br/>
behind under a hiding rock for the Split Rock letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the violet path. Pass a laurel grove on your right. A <br/>
short way beyond you will see a triple=split rock on your right, <br/>
Keep looking back over your right shoulder so you don't miss it. <br/>
Take the 15 steps off the trail to reach it; look under the west side <br/>
under a hiding stone for your second prize, the Triple Split <br/>
letterbox. 2 so far in only 15 minutes!<br/>
<br/>
Once again keep to the violet trail. Up ahead, after you pass a <br/>
cleared area off to your left, you will cross a log bridge, then a <br/>
stepping-stone bridge, next a Scout bridge. Go right on the white <br/>
trail (rectangular blazes now) and cross another log bridge. <br/>
Soon you will note 2 LARGE boulders on your left. Look under <br/>
the left side of the left boulder for your third find, the Double Rock <br/>
letterbox. (watch out for poison ivy)<br/>
<br/>
Proceed on the white trail, puff up a steeper section and keep <br/>
right on white. When you come to the violet cross trail, take it. You <br/>
will be hearing Route 80 traffic to your left and will know you are <br/>
close to completing the loop. Ahead you will see two "kissing <br/>
rocks" with the Kissing Rocks letterbox hidden under a hiding <br/>
log in their embrace. Four done!<br/>
<br/>
Soon rejoin the violet trail and head left for a short jaunt to your <br/>
car!<br/>
