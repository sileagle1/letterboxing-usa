Hi!  <br/>
<br/>
In my boxing today, I came across three that need some TLC.  <br/>
<br/>
"Tiki Idol" has gotten drenched.  The book is moldy and the inkpad <br/>
is so wet the stamp just runs off the page.  I dried everything off <br/>
as best I could and replace the plastic baggies, but it needs a new <br/>
brown stamp pad.  <br/>
<br/>
"Dirigible Delite" has also gotten soaked.  The book was very damp, <br/>
but more importantly, I used the last page in it today.  <br/>
<br/>
"Here Comes the Sun" was in great condition, except I used the last <br/>
page in its book too. <br/>
<br/>
I looked for a FAQ or something regarding filled logbooks and didn't <br/>
find anything.  Could someone please tell me the proper procedure?  <br/>
Was I supposed to pick them up and send them back to the original <br/>
placers?  Or just add a new logbook myself?  <br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for the replies!  <br/>

Regarding Loggerhead, I checked and I seem to have been the last person who has logged it as found.  I found it on April 16, and it was well-hidden and in good condition.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortunately, I had a new stamp pad in hand for Tiki Idol, but was not able to locate the box.  I believe I found the correct tree, did a full circle around it, but the brush was thickly overgrown.  It did not look as tho anyone had been there in a while.  It also would have helped if I had worn long pants, but the weather being in the 90's today....  Summer has arrived in South Florida!  Lovely park, and only the sound of 2 folks playing tennis!<br/>
<br/>
Southern Oracle or Terrapin Travelers, if you email me offline to confirm location of the box, I will make another pass.<br/>
