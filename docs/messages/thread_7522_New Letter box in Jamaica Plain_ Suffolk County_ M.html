<br/>
Placed 9/7/2002 by Adelcoll Cavy-Lovers<br/>
<br/>
	The Mad Chef is terribly upset because recently all his <br/>
culinary concoctions are continually combusting. To help him cool <br/>
down, we've tucked him into a restful spot in a shady park where he <br/>
can study for a less incendiary career in horticulture. Please pay <br/>
him a visit at this "zoo for trees" in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.<br/>
<br/>
  	A map and visiting hours for the Mad Chef's home can be found <br/>
at <br/>
http://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/visitors/visitors.html <br/>
Please respect the plant life. Finding the Mad Chef can be done <br/>
without disturbing or stressing any living thing.<br/>
<br/>
	Here is our recommended path to the Mad Chef, but you take <br/>
your own tour of the park by examining the map. Note: No cars are <br/>
permitted along the "roads" shown on the map. Below I have referred <br/>
to street and path names as they appear on the map. However, there <br/>
are no signposts in the park. "Streets" are paved. "Paths" are not.<br/>
<br/>
	We recommend parking along Route 203, the Arborway, near the <br/>
Main Gate to the park (125 Arborway St.). Immediately to your right <br/>
when you go through the gate is a visitor center at which you can <br/>
purchase a map for $1.00. Also there are public restrooms and a <br/>
drinking fountain. <br/>
<br/>
	After you leave the visitor center, continue on the road a <br/>
short distance and you will come to a trail on the right. Take this <br/>
trail up the hill and see the tulip trees, among other varieties. <br/>
Soon you will see some formal gardens to your right. They are not <br/>
fully planted yet, but follow the path through them up the hill where <br/>
you will find a delightful bonsai exhibit (opposite the Dana <br/>
Greenhouses). After examining these tiny trees, continue along the <br/>
paved road in front of the bonsai house (with your back to the bonsai <br/>
house, go left down the road). This will bring you to Bussey Hill <br/>
Road. Go right. Soon there will be a fork in the road. Take the right <br/>
branch. Soon, the road ends; go left. (To the right you can see/hear <br/>
a gate to well-trafficked Centre Street).  <br/>
<br/>
Continue about 500 feet until you come to Conifer Path on the right --<br/>
 sand and gravel path leading up a gentle hill. Not sure it's the <br/>
right path? Look to the left and see some large but low rocks. On the <br/>
right, find the Pignut Hickory Tree.<br/>
<br/>
Travel up the path about 83 adult steps. On the left side, look for <br/>
an unusual pine tree with reddish-orange bark. A tag hanging from a <br/>
left side branch indicates it is a "Japanese Red Pine". <br/>
<br/>
Standing on the path with your back to this pine you will see a <br/>
hillside clearing. Walk about 15 steps from the center of the path up <br/>
the hill into the clearing. To you left will be a large oak and <br/>
straight ahead of you will be towards a large "Christmas Tree" <br/>
(Arbovitae?).  Look between these two trees. About 30 adult steps <br/>
away you will see another large oak visible amongst some small pine <br/>
trees. Walk straight to the oak.<br/>
<br/>
When standing at the oak, facing it, turn right about 90 degrees and <br/>
see some rock outcroppings. Walk to the (adult) knee high rock and <br/>
step up on it. Keep your back to the oak. In front of you is another <br/>
rock outcropping. Look in front of you for the cleft in the rocks. Go <br/>
to the cleft. The Mad Chef is awaiting your visit at the bottom of <br/>
the cleft, tucked under the right side. It has been disguised with a <br/>
small rock and some leaves.<br/>
<br/>
To complete your tour of the park and return to your car: Return to <br/>
the Conifer Path and follow it to the end. Turn left onto Hemlock <br/>
Road. Hemlock Road will come to an end at an intersection, but you <br/>
can continue in the same general direction by picking up the Beech <br/>
Path. At a fork along the path, stay left. Soon after you will be <br/>
returned to Bussey Hill Road. Bear Right onto the road, and then turn <br/>
Left at the rose garden and lily pond. Continue about 3/8 to the <br/>
visitor center and the Main Gate.<br/>
