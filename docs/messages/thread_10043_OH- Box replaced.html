spent the day checking on the boxes I have placed. One was reported as<br/>
missing a week or so ago, so I carved a new stamp and put together a new<br/>
replacement microbox just in case. Good thing I did. Box #2 of the Happy Dog<br/>
series has been replaced in the same location- with a new stamp. Not quite<br/>
as cute as the original, but still a nice addition to a log book (if I do<br/>
say so myself <grin>). For those of you interested in picking up little<br/>
traveling stamps, I'd encourage you to check out the Happy Dog Series<br/>
(there's a bonus box there too!).<br/>
My Rapid Run box was uncovered and visible to anyone walking by, but was<br/>
still there, so I recovered it. Very few visitors for this short hike box.<br/>
The hardest part of the day was trying not to leave tracks in the snow<br/>
around the boxes :-) The dogs &amp; I thoughroughly enjoyed the run (Well, O.K.<br/>
I walked) &amp; they are contentedly snoozing on the couch :-)<br/>
Thank you to all who have visited and left nice comments.<br/>
