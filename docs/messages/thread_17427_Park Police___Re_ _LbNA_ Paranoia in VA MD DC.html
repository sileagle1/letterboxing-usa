enough to be able to visit your Dancing Bears box at <br/>
Carderock Falls this past fall, especially enjoying<br/>
seeing the kayakers and rare cacti.  I have to wonder<br/>
if it would have to do with park police?  When I<br/>
visited, I ran into a park police who had warned us<br/>
about geocaching, even indicating that a hefty fine<br/>
could be imposed :(.  When we got back out to the main<br/>
trail where people fish, there was another police who<br/>
was stopping and checking everyone who was fishing for<br/>
their fishing licenses.  Seemed like a highly<br/>
regulated and strictly enforced area. On a more<br/>
optimistic note, I  also got to visit your Big Schloss<br/>
letterbox in Mid September at which time it was in<br/>
good shape and, indeed, present. I'll cry too now<br/>
about your MIA boxes.  From what I've seen so far they<br/>
hav provided awesome rewarding experiences! <br/>
So...waaaaa!!!! :) -Wordfried  <br/>

&gt; I hear rumour that my Poison Ivy box is gone (I'll<br/>
&gt; check Thursday).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And a friend told me my Cunningham Falls box is also<br/>
&gt; gone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WAAAAH.  I'll have to check up on that one soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That leaves the Lions in DC, <br/>
&gt; the Guardian of Big Schloss in VA, <br/>
&gt; and Calvin &amp; Hobbes in Rockville.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is anyone else practicing the Unofficial Box<br/>
&gt; Maintenance Week?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ciao!  Poison Ivy<br/>
