Williamsburg, VA this week to get the boxes there and to plant some of<br/>
our own. Fortunately, the weather was pretty mild while we were<br/>
boxing, but after noontime, it was like Mother Nature threw a switch<br/>
and the breeze disappeared while the humidity blossomed. We were both<br/>
getting pretty worn down, and unfortunately, I was the only one able<br/>
to hide a box before we raced to partake of the AC in the Visitor's<br/>
Center gift shop.<br/>
<br/>
All of the boxes are in great shape:<br/>
<br/>
1) The logbook for Cardinals Rule only has about eight blank pages<br/>
left. It has existed since 2001 and makes a fascinating record to<br/>
read! Oddly enough, the Web site has listed this box as MIA since June<br/>
2002, and lots of folk have stamped in since that time.<br/>
<br/>
2) Taskinas Creek is in great shape. So considerate to have planted it<br/>
right beside a bench!<br/>
<br/>
3) One of the two logs for Pupa was completely filled while the other<br/>
logbook had only two or three blank pages left. I donated a little<br/>
composition book in anticipation of the second logbook getting all<br/>
filled up, too. Again, Pupa also has been around since 2001, and its<br/>
logs are a delight to read.<br/>
<br/>
4) Mattaponi Trail is indeed MIA. But I planted Fossil to hopefully<br/>
compensate.<br/>
<br/>
We also stopped off at Spike's New Kent County box. It is a very<br/>
well-carved and humorous stamp, and the logbook must have been created<br/>
by Martha Stewart. It's very posh looking.<br/>
<br/>
York River State Park is such a fab park. Susan said when we were<br/>
leaving that it had a lot of atmosphere and ambience, and I agreed<br/>
wholeheartedly. The Williamsburg boxers are very lucky to have such a<br/>
gem in their backyards!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Bobcat crew!  Sounds like you all had a great time at Williamsburg!  I <br/>
see there are a few boxes we missed when we were there -- but, we had little <br/>
Ma and it was pretty rainy and windy so we'll search more next time.  We <br/>
also took refuge in several of the gift shops.  I think our quotient of <br/>
souvenirs far outweighed our number of boxes found that weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Just curious -- did the Pupa box still have the adult stamp with it?  I <br/>
never understood why the two were together.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the update!  BeMa<br/>
