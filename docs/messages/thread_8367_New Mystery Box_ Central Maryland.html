   Michael woke up in a sweat. He was overcome with a terrible <br/>
feeling that his brother, Marc, was in distress. Michael wanted to <br/>
bring his dog, Target, but decided that bringing his pet wasn't a <br/>
smart idea.<br/>
   Going south he saw Marc. Marc was racing east, then suddenly <br/>
Michael saw him running west. What was happening?<br/>
   Obviously, Marc needed help. He said he had lost his box of <br/>
directions. They searched all day. Michael insisted the box was east. <br/>
Marc said no, it had to be west. Michael knew he was correct. Finally <br/>
Michael insisted he had to go home, take a bath and go to bed.<br/>
   Marc is still racing around. Can you help him find his lost box?<br/>
   There is a pile of rocks, please rehide carefully.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   The best time to look for this box is on a Saturday or Sunday. <br/>
Don't even attempt this on a weekday.<br/>
