                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, I'm new at this and this is my first post to the list so I hope I'm  <br/>
doing this right.  We were just to Hilton Head Island, SC and looked up the  4 <br/>
letterboxes there and I wanted to update the owners on what we  found.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was just there a week before us, but I don't see an update from  <br/>
them, so I'll go for it here.<br/>
<br/>
Tower Beach Sand Dollar: In your clues, you might want to change the  part <br/>
that reads "Also: When you pay the $5 toll to get to Hilton Head" to read  "the <br/>
$5 toll to get into Sea Pines Plantation"...  Minor fix, but could be  <br/>
confusing if someone is not used to Hilton Head.  BUT, the bad news is that  Tower <br/>
Beach is now for owners only and we could not get in.  There was a  teenage <br/>
guard "protecting" the area! <br/>
<br/>
Island Pleasures; Dolphin: We searched and searched and could not find  this <br/>
one.  WE think it may have gotten washed away in a high tide?  <br/>
<br/>
Island Pleasures; Conch Shell: Found this one!!  It wasn't hidden  well, so <br/>
we covered it up when we left.  It was a little damp even though  it was in <br/>
it's container and the ziplock, so we tried to air it out a  bit.<br/>
<br/>
Harbour Town: We know this area well so we could imagine in our minds  how <br/>
many times we must have stood there outside the boys bathroom right next to  it! <br/>
 LOL.  We found it and it, too, was a bit damp, but we aired it  out while we <br/>
ate lunch.  It almost didn't get put back, though, because  when I went to <br/>
place it a gigantic, huge, ugly lizard was in the tree area and  by the time I <br/>
screamed about how ugly it was, went and got my camera I had  attracted the <br/>
attention of several camp directors!  LOL.  Plus the  lizard wouldn't go away!  <br/>
But eventually it all died down and we got it put  away.  Thank goodness. <br/>
