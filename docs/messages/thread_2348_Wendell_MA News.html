                    <div class="plaintext-content">Even though I'm new enough to not have visited these boxes yet at <br/>
all, I think it's cool that you plan on retiring the old stamps and <br/>
finding new places for new boxes. It's like the limited editions of <br/>
just about any collectible item...and it will bring people back to <br/>
the park. I've heard some say (not we) that there isn't a point to <br/>
re-finding a box once found.<br/>
<br/>
This activity does allow us to share special places, and I've really <br/>
enjoyed visiting the sites more than the boxes, though some of the <br/>
artistry in the logbooks are way cool, not just stamps but sketches <br/>
too. I think, like me, LoneMassWolf will always retain sentimental <br/>
feelings about the special places (and friends) letterboxing has <br/>
brought him, and, like me, will always look forward to adding to that <br/>
"cache" of memories.<br/>

...hope I said that right...<br/>

&gt; quite frankly, I think the hiding places and clues are not the <br/>
best.  <br/>
&gt; Wendell State Forest is a great place, so I'll definitely keep a <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; or two there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The idea is to give people an incentive to revisit Wendell :-)<br/>

days off....<br/>
