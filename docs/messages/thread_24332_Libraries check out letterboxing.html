We saw a notices in our local library newsletter, but they have had<br/>
little interest in working with the Mid Missouri Letterboxers.  You can<br/>
read more about our contacts with the library at the Mid Missouri<br/>

Here's what one library is doing.... sounds like codes, ciphers,   <br/>
braille, mysteries, clues, treasure hunts, etc.. no mention of  <br/>
letterboxing at this site.. but I could see where they might think it  <br/>
fits in.<br/>

Nautical theme.  There's a lot of variety (usually state-by-state) in <br/>
what they use for the program.  <br/>
<br/>
That said, I wish we were doing the Get a Clue program (sponsored by <br/>
the Collaborative Summer Library Program).  My little letterboxers <br/>
would get into those themes and programs more than the Nautical ones.<br/>
