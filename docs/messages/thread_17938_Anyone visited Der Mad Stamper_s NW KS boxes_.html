Has anyone visited those boxes recently?  I was thinking of Wilson Lake, Waconda Lake, etc.<br/>

Baby Bear &amp; I visited several old boxes in Kansas in late<br/>
June of last year.  These are the ones we found alive &amp; well:<br/>
Sebelius Lake, Kirwin Lake, Home On The Range, Wheat Head,<br/>
Waconda Lake, Webster Lake, Wilson Lake &amp; Bucking Bronc.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
