<div>I was at the site of the box on 04/08/01 
and the box was missing. The directions were simple enough as I found the spot 
without difficulty. The tree was there, the hole was there but there was no 
cover and I dug into the dirt as deep as I thought that the box would be. I 
couldn't find a thing. A group of us camp just up the river from this spot every 
year in April and as I am new to this sport I was excited about the box and 
location. If the people that planted the box would drop me line I sure would 
like to talk to them. Thanks in advance, Lee Outlaw.</div></body></html>
