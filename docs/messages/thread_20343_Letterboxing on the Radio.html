<br/>
*shrug*  It might cover the cost of renting a classroom somewhere.  I <br/>
might help cover the cost of printing handouts or carving materials.<br/>

I'd certainly hope they will do more than just point users to a bunch <br/>

information to make judgement.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My opinion of the class would depend on what's being taught.  If someone is <br/>
teaching things like map reading, how to use a compass properly, safety and <br/>
first aid in forest preserves, what poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac look <br/>
like,  what to do if you're hiking with your dog and your dog gets skunked, <br/>
or is threatened with a nasty run-in with a coyote, why it's not such a smart <br/>
idea to forget to fill your water bottle and decide to fill it from the nearest <br/>
clear-looking stream, how to properly remove and save a tick in case it's <br/>
needed for testing, the symptoms of Lyme disease, West Nile Virus, etc. etc. <br/>
etc., I can think of more than a few people who could make good use of such a <br/>
class.  It might also include stamp carving, proper and safe use of carving <br/>
instruments, etc. and I'd be just fine with it.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, it's a class to say, just pass out hand-outs of various <br/>
websites offering clues, that'd be a horse of a different colour. I'd consider <br/>
that a bit of a rip-off.  Tho I can't imagine anyone getting rich off a $5 <br/>
class.  <br/>

&gt; My opinion of the class would depend on what's being<br/>
&gt; taught.  If someone is <br/>
&gt; teaching things like map reading, how to use a<br/>
&gt; compass properly, safety and <br/>
&gt; first aid in forest preserves, what poison ivy,<br/>
&gt; poison oak, and poison sumac look <br/>
&gt; like,  what to do if you're hiking with your dog and<br/>
&gt; your dog gets skunked, <br/>
&gt; or is threatened with a nasty run-in with a coyote,<br/>
&gt; why it's not such a smart <br/>
&gt; idea to forget to fill your water bottle and decide<br/>
&gt; to fill it from the nearest <br/>
&gt; clear-looking stream, how to properly remove and<br/>
&gt; save a tick in case it's <br/>
&gt; needed for testing, the symptoms of Lyme disease,<br/>
&gt; West Nile Virus, etc. etc. <br/>
&gt; etc., I can think of more than a few people who<br/>
&gt; could make good use of such a <br/>
&gt; class.  It might also include stamp carving, proper<br/>
&gt; and safe use of carving <br/>
&gt; instruments, etc. and I'd be just fine with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, it's a class to say, just pass<br/>
&gt; out hand-outs of various <br/>
&gt; websites offering clues, that'd be a horse of a<br/>
&gt; different colour. I'd consider <br/>
&gt; that a bit of a rip-off.  Tho I can't imagine anyone<br/>
&gt; getting rich off a $5 <br/>
&gt; class.  <br/>

them, but that people are being led to them through<br/>
the class and there is no way of knowing how diligent<br/>
they would be in caring for the boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
As an example, we are planning an introduction<br/>
to/demonstration of letterboxing for a boy scout<br/>
troop, but we won't use "live" boxes because we don't<br/>
have a way of measuring the degree of care or concern<br/>
they might have with a real box, even though we know<br/>
they are scouts and have been thoroughly trained in<br/>
Leave No Trace and resource management, and "should"<br/>
know how to respect the property of others.  We don't<br/>
know most of those boys personally, so we don't know<br/>
how well all that training has taken. If we were to do<br/>
a couple of those types of demos and they went well,<br/>
we might do another and go for a real box, but before<br/>
we did it, we would contact the placer and ask<br/>
permission, just as a matter of courtesy, especially<br/>
since we might be exposing someone else's boxes to<br/>
greater risk by bringing/sending a group to the box.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Still seems to me that people "led" to boxes through a class will have every bit as much chance of being diligent in caring for boxes as those who stumble upon a website and are "led" to go out on their own or with a gang of friends for the first time.  A class will offer chances to ask questions, and might even be more likely to spend more time with the FAQs than an individual anxious to just get out there.  You're right, there's no way of knowing how careful these people will be.  But say the class has 20 people --they are interested enough to pay a fee, and most will probably be older than boy scouts.   It's likely the LbNA site could have even more new visitors than that every single day of all ages, and there is also no way of knowing how careful those visitors are with the boxes, day after day.  Judging by the number of ruined boxes, the odds don't seem great.  They spent nothing to get the clues, and they can easily go out without bothering to read FAQs. So I can't see how that is so much worse than a group of people waiting to take a class. From what I've heard, plenty of people here on this list went out for their first time with a large family group or group of friends, armed only with what they could learn from the LbNA site.  That's the way we have it set up to work right now, folks.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I tried using the earlier mentioned link to get to the info about <br/>
the Northfield Mt. class on Sunday but it wouldn't work for me.  I <br/>
found the info at www.nu.com/northfield/updates.asp<br/>
<br/>
This is what the website says (and I quote):<br/>
Introduction to Letterboxing and Geocaching<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, September 19; 1  4 pm<br/>
For ages 8 and older<br/>
Fee: $5 person<br/>
Pre-registration required<br/>
<br/>
Learn how to find small treasure boxes hidden in beautiful natural <br/>
areas. Both these activities involve visiting websites to get clues <br/>
to specific sites and using maps, written directions, or a global <br/>
positioning system (GPS) unit to navigate to boxes or caches. These <br/>
activities appeal to the treasure hunter instinct in everyone from <br/>
young families to adults. We'll spend time indoors learning how to <br/>
use the websites and the specific tools of each trade  notebooks <br/>
and handmade stamps for letterboxing, and the GPS for geocaching. <br/>
The group will then head out to find an example of each type of box. <br/>
Bring a notebook and water and wear sturdy shoes and woods clothes. <br/>
Program will involve some off-trail travel and a maximum distance of <br/>
a couple of miles on rolling terrain. No GPS unit required. Heavy <br/>
rain cancels. Program begins at Northfield Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The jury is still out in my mind as to whether this is a good thing <br/>
or not.  As mentioned in my last post, I'm planning to go.  Ms <br/>
Dragonfli offered to go with me earlier and I hope she is stil up <br/>
for it!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
Kerri <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  It also said that heavy rain cancels.  So, this may all be for <br/>
naught any way.  (:<br/>

Lets not beat this to death with all of our wisdom.   The class is the<br/>
class for whatever it is, let it be.   Our own Theory of what it may be is<br/>
worthless.   Let those that attend tell us the facts and lets give this one<br/>
a rest!! <br/>
