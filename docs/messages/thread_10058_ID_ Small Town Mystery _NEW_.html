Somewhere in Idaho!! <br/>

Description: Easy once you figure out the town.<br/>
<br/>
Small Town Mystery Clues:  In the small town of _ _ _ _, she waits <br/>
for you to find her.  She is a Young Adult book title of eight <br/>
letters _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ written by Jerry Spinelli.  Once you know the <br/>
title go to the town in Idaho with the first half of her name.  Find <br/>
the path where Frost and Knox meet.  Follow the first white fence <br/>
north to a big boulder.  She is nestled in between it and a smaller <br/>
rock on its right.  Hide her well so she can't be seen from the path.<br/>
