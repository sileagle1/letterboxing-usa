Makes sense that stamp medium would be with the art supplies.  I get my "cuts <br/>
like butter" stamp stuff at an art store (ArtMedia), mostly.  <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of linoleum.  Since carving stamps for letterboxes, I have gained a <br/>
bit more confidence and am going to try my hand at making a linoleum block <br/>
carving. Then make personalized Holiday cards this winter!  Woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, I get frustrated with stores like Michael's (no offense) and <br/>
Craft Warehouse that seem to want to sell crafts-by-the-kit.  Its like baking <br/>
a cake From a Box Vs. From Scratch.  But I suppose that's where the money is. <br/>
 And, makes inventory easier I'll bet.  (Gotta be a nightmare.)  Still, a kit <br/>
takes away some of the creativity by limiting product and encouraging <br/>
conformity.  (More of a social commentary than targeting craft stores.)  <br/>

&lt;&lt; hello all,<br/>
 at this point, i am embarrased to state, but i work for michaels. <br/>
 personally, i TRY to help people find things, or refer the people to <br/>
 staff who might know the specific merchandise better. i am terribly <br/>
 sorry for all the bad experiences, and i dont own stock. its just <br/>
 sad. now that i know where to go to find the sku numbers, i will <br/>
 bother my manager to carry more than the one beginner kit (piece of <br/>
 rubber, scary tool handle and 2 blades for $10...)<br/>
<br/>
 as for FINDING the carving meduim...<br/>
 it is most likely in the art department near the oil paints and such. <br/>
 next row over, maybe. being made by speedball it should be grouped <br/>
 near their calligraphy merchandise, and to date, the company i <br/>
 believe considers it "lineoleum carving" materials, which is a <br/>
 dissapearing old school art form. like silk screen printing. on the <br/>
 same row should be the magic rub and stadeler erasers, which i have <br/>
 had much success with. magic rub is cheaper. dollar tree carries <br/>
 rubber erasers, 6 to a package, in neon colors which work <br/>
 exceptionally well, it is just a hassle to find them. i have been in <br/>
 3 stores and only 1 had 'em. they are slightly thinner.<br/>
<br/>
 and if you are in the area....<br/>
 the chesapeake bay artist's association is holding their annual <br/>
 outdoor art show this weekend, 10 to 6 saturday 17th and 12 to 6 <br/>
 sunday 18th. if you have seen the ov letterbox or plan to visit, it <br/>
 would be a good time to drop by. you will know my exhibit by what i <br/>
 am showing... and if you show me my stamp in your book i will give <br/>
 you a signed  OV one. untill i run out, that is. i was gonna try to <br/>
 sell it, but decided that it was REALLY BAD ETHICS.... so i made 6 <br/>
 more specifically to sell but not plant. after the art show i will <br/>
 get back to planting stamps. and i am from the old school, i consider <br/>
 it linoleum carving when in rubber. in wood is woodcarving. feels <br/>
 more artsy than "stamp", which is what both are anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 anyway, good luck finding medium, when i get out to pembroke i will <br/>
 write down those sku numbers and post them so all yall can tell the <br/>
 store managers specifically what you want them to carry. sorry for <br/>
 all the grief,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Did you know you can make them multiple colors?  <br/>
<br/>
For example, an old art piece I did once had a green dragon flying <br/>
over a castle by the light of a red moon.<br/>
<br/>
I carved out all of the areas that would show the red detail first, <br/>
printed my prints, then carved out all of the areas that would be <br/>
green, also removing the previous red areas but leaving the detail <br/>
lines i needed.<br/>
<br/>
I printed the green over top of the red.<br/>
<br/>
Then fianlly I carved away everything that wasnt going to be black <br/>
and prnted that.<br/>
<br/>
It was a pretty neat process.<br/>

and it is more work than eraser carving...and for letterboxing<br/>
purposes...more difficult to use.  However, I learned to do<br/>
it in a seventh grade art class.<br/>
<br/>
Also, please do not thumb your nose at kits.  Many times they<br/>
give people the courage to try something for the first time;<br/>
otherwise, figuring out what to buy may discourage the timid.<br/>
Once you get the kit, you know what to buy (or NOT to buy),<br/>
and if the experience is enjoyable, the kit<br/>
 becomes a springboard for creativity because we have to<br/>
find a way to use the left over ink or whatever!  <br/>

Once a person has a little knowledge, it is easier to select the various <br/>
supplies needed, too.<br/>
