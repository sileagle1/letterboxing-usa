                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am leaning toward Waterloo State Park, which is near Chelsea, but I <br/>
really want to take a look first and the weather has been so horrible <br/>
the past month that I haven't been able to make the drive over <br/>
there.  From everything I have read on the Internet and the <br/>
conversation I had with the park folks, this sounds like it will meet <br/>
all of our needs, but I hate to choose a site without actually seeing <br/>
it first.<br/>
<br/>
If there is anyone close to there that would be willing to scout it <br/>
out, let me know.  I've been hoping for hoping for a winter reprieve <br/>
to at least give me dry roads for a day or two, but I don't think I <br/>
am going to be able to get over there any time soon, considering we <br/>
got dumped with another 8" of snow last night.<br/>
<br/>
The show sounds like a great evening activity.  I will try to get <br/>
something definite in place as far as location within the next week <br/>
or two so those who are interested can purchase tickets.<br/>
