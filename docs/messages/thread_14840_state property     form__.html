mean, how rude!  I am quite proud of our box, I have to say, and I <br/>
hope it gets to hang out for a long time.  After all, it took us over <br/>
a month to finally get out and plant it!<br/>
Where do you get a form to fill out, anyway?  Seems to take all the <br/>
fun out of it, ya know?  Oh well, I already have a place in mind for <br/>
my next one, and it's not on state property.  I just need to figure <br/>
out a good container to use for a semi-micro box.  Film canister is <br/>
just a little too small.  Happy boxing everyone!<br/>
