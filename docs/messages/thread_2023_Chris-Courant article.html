While I've been online reading the mail, my mom found an article dated<br/>
Sunday sept. 3. Titled letterboxing. It's got a picture of Eirc Eurto<br/>
oreplacing a box found by a tree and a picture of the guestbook. Is this<br/>
the article you are looking for, or is it the other one that my mom is<br/>
still looking for?<br/>

I was actually thinking that it would be nice to place a copy of the <br/>
article in boxes that we place in Connecticut, in case someone finds <br/>
it.  It could go along with the standard piece of paper explaining <br/>
letterboxing.  Of course, permission would have to be obtained from <br/>
the Courant, I'd imagine.<br/>
