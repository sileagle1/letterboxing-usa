library with the consent of a librarian.  I'll be interested to see <br/>
the "clues" are too hard.  I have some ideas to change them to make <br/>
it a little easier to find.  In any case hunters can also look <br/>
for "The Road to Enlightenment" series already in the library.<br/>

Indoor letterbox book<br/>
Not easy<br/>
<br/>
"Hey, it's a full moon.  Do you think we'll get any crazies tonight?" <br/>
"What do you mean `we', Michele?  How come `I' always get the strange <br/>
ones?" <br/>
"Oh, you attract them my dear.  I'm sure." <br/>
"Yeah right." <br/>
For some reason Faye did seem to get more than her fair share of the <br/>
people with odd requests, or people who were just plain odd.  But <br/>
surely, that last full moon was just a coincidence.<br/>
"Oh great!  Here comes one now," she thought, spying a woman in what <br/>
looked like a cross between an old nun's habit and maybe a nursing <br/>
outfit. <br/>
"I am interested in anesthesia and the history of the Crimea."  <br/>
"Yes Miss"  <br/>
"You may call me Florence." <br/>
"...Florence.  Here are a couple of places you can look.  I'll write <br/>
them down for you."  <br/>
Miss Florence had only just left when a man in a high school band <br/>
outfit approached her.  "Hello."  "Wait.  Let me guess.  You are <br/>
looking for `how to' books on band leading?"<br/>
"Why yes Madame Librarian.  How did you know?"  Faye took off her <br/>
glasses while she handed him some notes.  He left with a wide smile.<br/>
In the corner of her eye she sensed rather than saw a dark shape <br/>
approaching the desk.  She turned to face a tall man in a rough dark <br/>
cloak with a hood.  "Is someone having a costume party," she thought <br/>
to herself, "Where are these people coming from?"<br/>
It leaned towards her and uttered in a loud, breathy <br/>
whisper, "Shiiire.  Bagggins." <br/>
"You must want fi fi fiction.  Under T T T o l," she stuttered in <br/>
reply.  "Was he ever creepy.  I couldn't even see his face," she <br/>
shuddered as he glided off. <br/>
"Excuse me Ma'am, I was hoping you might be able to help me with a <br/>
little inquiry."  <br/>
She was smiling at the old fashioned speech before she looked up and <br/>
stifled a laugh.  The stranger's clothes were so old fashioned he <br/>
looked like a play actor.  <br/>
"Ma'am?"  <br/>
"Um, yes.  How may I help you?"  <br/>
"I am looking for books on Balls Bluff."  <br/>
"I don't see anything on that subject in the catalog Mr. um..."  <br/>
"Raines, Harrison Raines, Ma'am."  <br/>
"...Mr. Raines.  But just because you can't find your subject listed <br/>
specifically, doesn't mean there are no<br/>
books related to it.  What is Balls Bluff about?  What other subjects <br/>
come to mind?"  <br/>
He explained his interest and after more catalog searches she wrote <br/>
down the numbers of the civil war history section, firearms and <br/>
horses.  <br/>
"I'm sorry Ma'am I am not familiar with the library.  Might you be <br/>
free to accompany me and acquaint me with the layout."  <br/>
"Um, well...why certainly.  I would be glad to."<br/>
<br/>
Michele had noticed that Faye was talking to herself even more than <br/>
usual tonight.  Then she saw Faye walking back towards the stacks <br/>
talking to no one next to her and walking as if she were holding <br/>
someone's arm.  Michele would have laughed if she hadn't been so <br/>
startled.  "I'll have to see just what Faye's been reading lately."<br/>
<br/>
Note:  You are not looking for a regular commercially printed book <br/>
that has been hollowed out and made into a letterbox so there is no <br/>
need to pull all the books off the shelves looking for it.  You are <br/>
looking for `The Letterbox Book' and should know it when you see it.  <br/>
If you find the letterbox missing or damaged or if you want a hint <br/>
write theDoubtfulGuests@yahoo.com.  <br/>
