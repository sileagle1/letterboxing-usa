<br/>
But in other news, I'd just like to remind everyone--despite normal <br/>
differences of opinions people have--the people on this list are <br/>
generally swell, well-meaning individuals that you'd be happy to <br/>
welcome into your home.  Everyone wants what is best for this hobby <br/>
we have in common, and a difference of opinion is just that, a <br/>
difference of opinion.  Let's not take any of these relatively minor <br/>
disagreements personally, and enjoy the boxing match!<br/>
