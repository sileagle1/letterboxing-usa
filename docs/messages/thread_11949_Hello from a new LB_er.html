                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm new to this list.. I was introduced to letterboxing about 2 weeks ago by someone on a PSP newsgroup and I was immediately intrigued!  I'm in Colorado - anyone else in Colorado on this list?<br/>
<br/>
I have not yet been out to find any letterboxes, still working on a stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
I have some questions about placing letterboxes - if it's in a State or National Park, do you ask permission first before placing them?  Do you ask permission at other places?  I was particularily curious about the letterbox (Scooby Doo series) that was placed in a library... was permission asked and granted?  The poster can email me off list about this if he/she prefers.<br/>
<br/>
I'm asking all these questions because I'm itching to start placing letterboxes, but I don't want to break any laws that I don't know about, or give letterboxing a bad name in any way... and I want to find out the best way to go about doing the placements.<br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks for putting up with my questions, I hope to be letterboxing really soon!<br/>

The Natl Park Service rulebook says you must ask permission or your <br/>
box will be removed. It varies with state and city park systems. I'd <br/>
ask other boxers in your area privately or via this group what their <br/>
experiences have been, but it seems like for the most part, you don't <br/>
have to ask beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the planters of the various library and bookstore boxes <br/>
will know for sure, but if memory serves, they didn't ask permission. <br/>
But of course, I may be speaking out of turn.<br/>

It's good manners to ask before you place a box and it also avoids the <br/>
problem of inadvertantly placing a box somewhere that might be harmful to <br/>
'boxers or the site.  I think it's always a good idea to ask first.  Mother <br/>

<br/>
The way a bunch of us got introduced to letterboxing was that Ryan <br/>
Carpenter placed a box in a store. The owner of the store "googled" <br/>
the name of his store and found Ryan had placed a box there. The <br/>
owner was not too amused but his staff was. The staff began to tell <br/>
others about 'boxing. Ryan did not ask permission. He did risk having <br/>
the owner destroy the box.<br/>
<br/>
In my upcoming Middle Earth series, I actually carved a stamp for a <br/>
store owner to use. Figured to rope him in to the thing. I let him <br/>
know that I was going to plant a box on or near his establishment. <br/>
<br/>
Pandy wrote a note to the staff of a bookstore up in Portland, <br/>
Oregon. She told them how it helped the store get customers. She left <br/>
the note in the box. The box is now missing. Sigh.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my answer to you is that it depends on who you know and <br/>
what you think their response would be. If there are no rangers <br/>
around (like here in CA), then I feel okay about planting a box as <br/>
long as it is close to the trail. At UCSB, we just took a chance and <br/>
planted the box on campus.  <br/>
<br/>
Even if you do tell the owner or ranger, it is no guarantee that the <br/>
box will remain. <br/>
<br/>
Best of luck and start planting those boxes,<br/>
