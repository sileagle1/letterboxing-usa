Messina Hof Winery and Resort is a hidden paradise in the <br/>
Bryan/College Station area.  Along with tasting award-winning wines, <br/>
the grounds include a themed villa, and incredible restaurant.   Our <br/>
dinner was the best we have had in a long time.  The villa is quaint <br/>
and relaxing, and the wine is enjoyable.   Tours are given daily, but <br/>
more often on Saturday (11:00, 12:30, 2:30, 4:00, and 5:30).  <br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Messina Hof" letterbox is located at the winery, just outside <br/>
the tasting room.  From Hwy 6 in Bryan, go northwest on Old Reliance <br/>
Road about 3 miles to the winery on your left (follow the signs once <br/>
on Old Reliance Road).  Park in the lot and take a wine tour!  <br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Once you are ready to find the box, exit out the back door of the <br/>
tasting room.  Walk down the wooden steps toward the pond, to the end <br/>
of the railing on your right side (north).   Be careful if others are <br/>
on the deck, since the box is very near.  Step down on the lowest <br/>
platform.  Face north, and go 4 paces to where a metal flashing holds <br/>
a ramp to this platform.  Standing on the right side of this metal, <br/>
at the corner, the box is under the main platform near this corner <br/>
section  (if you were standing in the grass at the end of the ramp <br/>
you can barely see it).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
