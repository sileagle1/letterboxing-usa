How many postal boxes are there? Maybe the owners would be willing to <br/>
post them to the database. I've been curious about the Autumnal <br/>
letterbox and of course the Martha's #2 and #4.Purple Iris<br/>

<br/>
The Letterbox in Your Letterbox (also known as Autumn and Mark's <br/>
postal letterbox) had a printed distribution list enclosed with the <br/>
box.  The last person that I know that had the box was schizokeet <br/>
from VA.  That was in August, and I haven't heard any word since <br/>
then.  I did email her to ask if she had sent it along, and to whom.<br/>
<br/>
To correct any mis-conceptions, there was no "order" to the list.  <br/>
The idea was that you could send to anyone on the list, and when <br/>
you'd get it - and from whom - would be part of the mystery. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, it means that I now don't have a clue who has it.  <br/>
<br/>
Schizokeet if you're out there - please let me know when you sent it, <br/>
and to whom.  <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Autumn<br/>

Well that clears that up.  I understand now what you were trying to <br/>
do but with a perpetually open list I guess anyone who signed up <br/>
should be surprised if they get it since there is no guarantee they <br/>
ever will.  Thanks for the explanation.  Happy boxing!<br/>
