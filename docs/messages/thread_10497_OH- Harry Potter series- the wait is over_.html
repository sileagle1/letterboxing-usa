<p><span>Leashed 
Nifflers welcome<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>This 
series contains a total of 4 boxes and </span><b><u><span>12 
stamps</span></u></b><span>. 
How you count them (if you survive) is up to you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Although 
you are a muggle, you have been chosen from a select group to participate in an 
experiment. I, a secret true blood, have been authorized by the Ministry of 
Magic to conduct an experiment to see if muggles could possibly survive and 
learn (doubtful) the ways of the wizards. For a limited time, a few muggles will 
be allowed to experience the journey taken by true bloods and Squibs to 
Hogwarts. If you are able to survive the journey, you will be given limited 
access to Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade &amp; Knockturn Alley so that you can equip 
yourselves with the tools of the trade needed to attend. Then you will seek the 
Sorting Hat that will assign you to your proper house for your brief stay at 
Hogwarts. Finally, you will journey to Kings Cross Station, platform 9  to get 
to Hogwarts. If you feel you are prepared for this test, you will need to find 
the treasures listed below in the Forbidden Forest. By making it past Boggert, 
Bane, Hinkypunks, Kappa &amp; Ronin, thus surviving your trip through the 
forest, you will be rewarded with portkeys to various locations. So load your 
bag with Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans and chocolate frogs, leash your 
Niffler and begin your journey if you dare!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Dissendium<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>You will be starting your journey at Owl Wood Hollow. Your first port key 
is located in the Badlands. This port key will take you to Hogsmeade, Diagon 
Alley &amp; Knockturn. I recommend you visit Flourish &amp; Blotts to peek at 
the books and learn a few needed spells (if you can even make them work). If the 
shop owner takes pity on you, he may even be willing to give you a Kwikspell 
course. Once you enter the trail, you will have to decide which way to go. 
Although left or right may seem the logical choices, you will go straight; for 
ahead of you lies what you seek. It is hidden well in the split between the 
large fallen tree. As you seek, watch for muggles that might interfere &amp; 
once you have completed your task, re-hide it well (just in case another muggle 
is as talented as you). Along with the spell that opens your passage to the 
shops you will need to visit, you will find your magic wand from Ollivanders and 
3 sets of plain work robes from Madam Malkins. Be sure to use them wisely, or 
you could turn yourself into a beast, or worse!</p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Now, 
youll need to use the spell to open the passage to visit Borgin and Burkes, 
Madam Malkins &amp; The Magical Menagerie because before you locate the sorting 
hat, you will need the following items: <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>one 
plain pointed hat for day wear<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>one 
standard (size 2) cauldron<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>an 
enchanted broomstick (choose a Firebolt<span>  
</span>if you dare)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>optional: 
you can bring an owl, cat or toad<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Be 
sure to don your invisibility cloak to hide your activities from muggles that 
have not been chosen!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The 
Sorting Hat:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Once 
you have the items you need, your journey is not over and is still threatened by 
the evil forces of the forbidden forest. To continue your journey, you will need 
to use the four points spell on your wand to assist you. Finding a friend who 
has done some arithmancy study may help as well. Since you do not have the 
training or the license from the Department of Magical Transportation (and you 
would splinch for sure), you will not be able to apparate from one place to the 
next, so youll need the clues youll find after getting the Dissendium 
Spell.<span>  </span>You may want to bring along 
a writing instrument to copy the spells youll be using.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>If 
you survive your whole journey and are admitted to Hogwarts (very doubtful), you 
will be able to use the Tarantallegra spell (dancing spell) to celebrate as well 
as visiting Hogsmeade for some well deserved butterbeer (adults only).<span>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>If 
any of you survive, please contact me so that I may amend my report that I have 
written on this study, which says muggles cannot possibly survive this 
experiment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Good 
Luck!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
