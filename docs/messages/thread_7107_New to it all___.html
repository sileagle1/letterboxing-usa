putting a few bits of moss over it then.  I'll think of something :o)<br/>

Ooops -- not moss either! Moss is pretty delicate, so moving living moss <br/>
would likely destroy it.<br/>
<br/>
A rocky ledge or hollow of a tree are terrific hiding places.<br/>

Finding a hiding place is just as challenging as creating your <br/>
letterbox.  Look for hollow logs or crevices around the bases of <br/>
trees. You can use loose leaves, straw, twigs or rocks (whatever is <br/>
already laying around the area) to cover up any parts of the box that <br/>
might still be showing.  <br/>
<br/>
If you go hunting for a few boxes first, you can get an idea of what <br/>
other folks have been doing to hide their boxes :-)<br/>
