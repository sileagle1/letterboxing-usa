by some artillery and gotten amnesia since I can't remember<br/>
who I am or why I am in this Talklist.  I would ask, but<br/>
I'm afraid of the repercussions.  I would go to the FAQ<br/>
but I don't know what that is.  Help!<br/>
Just kidding.<br/>
Seriously though, with all the bombardment of the past few<br/>
days I'm afraid one important post has gotten buried in the<br/>
rubble.  It is post # 41032, and it is asking for our input<br/>
to revamp the letterboxing.org site.  Now is your chance to<br/>
ask for everything you have always wanted, I know I already<br/>
have (like fix Louisiana &amp; International boxes).  Many states<br/>
have counties in wrong Regions, or Regions that don't make<br/>
sense so speak up.  Many of you may have already send responses<br/>
to the webmasters but I would encourage you to post some to<br/>
this talklist, too.  Who knows, it might inspire some PRODUCTIVE<br/>
DISCUSSION for a change.  Thanks.<br/>

Northern Illinois clue designation....  For some reason, DuPage <br/>
county clues pretty much always get shuffled into the "Illinois With <br/>
No Region Assigned" category, instead of "Northern Illinois" Clues.<br/>
<br/>
Used to drive me batty to see my clues land into that weird "no <br/>
region" never-never land (who would want to look for clues there?), <br/>
so I moved out of DuPage county because I could no longer face life <br/>
without a region.<br/>
<br/>
But all silliness aside, I think it would help folks make up their <br/>
mind about visiting northern IL for 'boxing if the page was an <br/>
accurate reflection of how many boxes really are in that area.<br/>

<br/>
On that note, I personally feel that southern WI should be split in <br/>
two.  There is a world of difference between SE WI and SW WI.  Make <br/>
the split N to S just east or west of Madison. Maybe even continue <br/>
the same split into northern IL.  There is also a world of <br/>
difference between NE and NW Il.  Thanks!<br/>
