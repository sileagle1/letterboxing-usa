<br/>
How long does it usually take for the webmasters to let you know if <br/>
your request to adopt a box has been approved?<br/>
We've decided that it's not financially possible to move west this <br/>
year, so we're hoping for next summer now. Since we're gonna be <br/>
around another year, I thought "Why not adopt some unclaimed boxes? <br/>
At least they'll get TLC for the next year." <br/>
I contacted them over a week ago but haven't heard anything. Maybe <br/>
I'm just a little too impatient? <br/>
<br/>
I also have a question about the PFX count. If you're the first <br/>
finder of a brand new HH, do you count that as a FF? <br/>
Thanks in advance for any help. <br/>
<br/>
