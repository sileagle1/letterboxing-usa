                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those of you who read no further than my original posting subject line <br/>
(which began with "NC"), boxers mentioned in the original Charlotte Observer <br/>
article (Jan 19) include TeamGreenDragon, The Vermont Viking, FunHog, Silent <br/>
Doug, Psychokiwis, and The Jolly G-Man.<br/>
<br/>
I have received two copies of the newspaper edition which featured <br/>
letterboxing; there's a lot more to it than in the online version.  The <br/>
article was in the Travel section, but the front page has (above the <br/>
masthead!) a picture of the beautiful stamp the Observer put in the box they <br/>
planted.  I don't like big cities anymore, but I'm going to make the trip <br/>
and try find it.<br/>
<br/>
The article includes several sidebars with letterboxing etiquette info, and <br/>
several photos.<br/>
<br/>
The writer is Travel Editor John Bordsen, and I think he did a great job.<br/>
