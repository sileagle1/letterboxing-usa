Maybe someone can explain why they think WOM restrictions are OK but f-count restrictions are not. <br/>

 No different. There will always be boxes out there that some people wont'<br/>
 ever see the clues too. It's the way of life. I personally would rather<br/>
 spend my time out chasing the boxes I DO have clues to then worry about the<br/>
 ones I don't. <br/>

<br/>
 Add my name to those unqualified to find your letterboxes. Data entry<br/>
 isn't my idea of a good time letterboxing. Funny that should label me<br/>
 as one who doesnt' care about my hobby. Sigh... Funhog (boxing since 2001)<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; I prefer to <br/>
 &gt; use Atlas Quest because it allows me to choose an F-count for the <br/>
 people <br/>
 &gt; looking for boxes in the area (don't get me wrong, I enjoy LbNA as<br/>
 well, but that <br/>
 &gt; one feature sways my listings). I feel that asking a letterboxer <br/>
 to meet one <br/>
 &gt; of a few simple requirements helps to ensure that people who care<br/>
 about the <br/>
 &gt; hobby are the ones who receive the clues. :o)<br/>
