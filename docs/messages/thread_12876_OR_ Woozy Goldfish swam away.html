West Salem's Woozy Goldfish has swum away.<br/>
If time I can muster, and materials I can gather,<br/>
I'll attempt to replace him later, no, sooner, much rather. <br/>
<br/>
**I was starting to wonder what was up with this box since NOBODY <br/>
had found it yet.  It must've gone missing immediately!  I found the <br/>
tree and no remnants of its former little abode.  Whoever found the <br/>
tree did an incredible number on it! Argh...  I'll try to get this <br/>
box replaced soon!**<br/>

I looked for this box a few weeks back and of course failed to find<br/>
it. From the looks of things, I got the distinct impression that folks<br/>
had been there ripping out the dreaded, evil, totally disgusting,<br/>
noxious plant, English Ivy. A pity the box needed the stuff to hide in<br/>
but I praise the people who try to eradicate it. Funhog<br/>
