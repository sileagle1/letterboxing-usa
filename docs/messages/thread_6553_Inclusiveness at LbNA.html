(what do you mean? the box is really there!!!), camaraderie, consensus<br/>
building, sharing, creativity, cooperation - I like to think that<br/>
these exemplify the LbNA group.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to make a few secret logs, false rocks, hidden in plain<br/>
view tromp l'oeil boxes. When we began this group many boxers shared<br/>
images of their first carving attempts as a way of obtaining guidance,<br/>
help, reassurance, and gentle critique from more experienced artists.<br/>
Somehow this aspect has fallen away and I miss it.  I plan on posting<br/>
an image every once in a while to (hopefully) resurrect his aspect of<br/>
our common pursuit.  I hope others will do the same.<br/>
<br/>
Is masterful deceit box making within the grasp of the home kitchen?<br/>
