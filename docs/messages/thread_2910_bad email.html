I started to have that problem a while back. The issue is that any <br/>
time you expose your email address on discussion groups or newsgroups <br/>
there is a possibility someone will harvest it. However, it is also <br/>
likely it is being harvested from your clue pages if you have a <br/>
contact email address listed there.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I run my own mailserver for my letterboxing.com domain <br/>
name and use numerous aggressive spam filters to reject any such <br/>
crap. However the best solution I have for others is to check out <br/>
www.bigfoot.com . They provide a forwarding service that allows you <br/>
to keep your current email address and create one (e.g. yourname@ <br/>
bigfoot.com) that forwards to your real email address. The big <br/>
advantage is that they also use aggressive spam filters to stop this <br/>
type of problem. I use a bigfoot account for my clues email address, <br/>
and  for most of all my general correspondence. It is VERY rare that <br/>
any spam gets through my bigfoot accounts to me. Try it, I think <br/>
you'll like it! Oh yeah, I use the free version they provide.<br/>

I hope you don't  allow your kids or their friends to use the internet or<br/>
watch television. Keep them away from the play fields and locker rooms! :-)<br/>
<br/>
You really need to learn how to use filters. Seriously. With a small amount<br/>
of effort your internet experience becomes what you want, or at least you<br/>
only see what you want. Do yourself and your kids a favor and learn to use<br/>
the tools at hand instead of tossing the famous baby out with the bath<br/>
water. You can have your cake and eat it too, why else would you have a<br/>
cake!<br/>

Re the porn that proliferates on the internet: I'm no expert, but I <br/>
do not think that the yahoo egroups are the source of the problem. <br/>

It's a frequent frustration to me that I can not see the full email <br/>
addresses of the members of this group. I would often like to reply <br/>
off-list to a comment, or to ask a question as the southern new <br/>
england "webmaster." But to all but a half-dozen people in the world, <br/>
letterboxer's email addresses look like this; drewclan@a...<br/>
<br/>
That "@a..." makes it impossible for the pornographers (and the <br/>
webmasters) to get your account. The problem is that there is so <br/>
darned much of it out there. That why they call it spam? You'll be <br/>
inundated with it whether you use this service or not, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Another possiblity is to not recieve any email: just click on <br/>
the "read on the web only" option. There is no porn on the list that <br/>
way, although there have been a couple of sales pitches break through <br/>
(sometimes I wonder if they're really mystery clues in disguise: that <br/>
would be a hoot!).<br/>
<br/>
Porn drives me absolutly crazy: I think I'll try Eric's filter <br/>
suggestion. Meanwhile, if you think egroups IS the source, go to <br/>
their website, click on "help," and fill out the form reporting the <br/>
problem to them so they'll do something about it.<br/>

Actually, in case people don't realize, there are two ways you can <br/>
send email directly to someone on the list.  Either click on their <br/>
name in the "from" category if they have posted or in the member <br/>
section.  You will come up with a posting form that is addressed <br/>
directly to that member.  Of course, you are stuck with the egroups <br/>
email system (no enclosures or sent copies) but at least that way you <br/>
can begin dialog and get a "real" email address for correspondance.<br/>
