<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In my opinion, a group stamp is fine to start, if 
it gets you out the door and letterboxing! *grin*  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>However, everyone will want his/her own stamp, so 
you can go on letterboxing adventures separately, with friends, 
etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's my opinion anyway!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
<div>Ais</div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like the idea of each person having a stamp. You may not always be <br/>
at every box together. I would also suggest each keeping their own <br/>
books. That's just my opinion but it's fine if you do it as a group <br/>
also.It is also nice when you meet another letterboxer and that <br/>
person gets several stamps for an exchange. I have a seperate stamp <br/>
for my dog. Anyone we meet gets two exchanges. Anyway you do it will <br/>
be fine. I'm mainly thinking you may someday be on a trip not all <br/>
together.....Chuck &amp; Molly<br/>
