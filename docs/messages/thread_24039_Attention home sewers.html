Every Walmart store manager has 'some' control over the products that <br/>
are sold in their store. For example many Walmarts do not carry guns <br/>
and ammunition, while other stores have an entire firearm area in <br/>
their sporting goods section. I would suggest that interested parties <br/>
contact the store near them and make their wishes known to the local <br/>
manager.<br/>

 &gt; employee at my local Walmart. At theat store they will ship it to<br/>
 &gt; other stores. 2800 will loose their fabric department in the next year<br/>
 &gt; and probably more then next until they're all phased out.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm...<br/>
