                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to all who let me know that "pink stuff" is in the calligraphy section of Michael's.  You were exactly right-- I went back and there it was, however only in the tools-included packs.  But I'm happy!  Our store is new, and the people I'd asked before sounded so sure that there were only pre-carved stamps. Now for a design.... are there any aardvarks that anyone knows of, already on this list?  (handles, or stamps) I saw there is already another yaketty-something, and that wasn't my final pick of a handle anyway.      --lunaryakketyact<br/>
