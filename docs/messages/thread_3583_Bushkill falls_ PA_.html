Today Floating Feather and I took a trip up into the Poconos and to Bushkill <br/>
Falls.<br/>
We were on the hunt for the letterbox planted there and are pretty certain <br/>
we found the spot, but alas, not the box. The spot is very close to the <br/>
"trail" and we checked out what we thought were all possiblities...<br/>
Anyway, a beautiful location and well worth the $8.- to get onto the trails, <br/>
once you get in and "on board",you understand and appreciate the fee. Even <br/>
the traffic on the way home was worth it, tho, I would suggest when you <br/>
go,if on a weekend, to return from Bushkill Falls via something other than <br/>
Rt.206 south, north is ok, but south is a crawl at best.<br/>
We decided to plant a box of our own since we had come up stampless and the <br/>
clues will follow soon.<br/>
Has anyone found the Bushkill box in the past few months? Would be thankfull <br/>
for any response.<br/>

I found it this summer.  You've got to use a little imagination.  Did <br/>
you check out the other box up north at the other falls?  I can't <br/>
think of the name.<br/>
