She's been a "finder" since she could walk and talk.  That's why she's my true boxing partner.... she's ready to go hunting on a moments notice.  She once fell in a creek 2 miles into a 5 mile hike, and even though we were closer to the beginning than the end, she insisted on going on.<br/>

In New York State you have to pay for a yearly permit to detect on state land.  The two don't work well though, a there is too much concentrated work... you can spend 3 hours and get only a few dozen yards up a trail, hoping for a find, as opposed to being fairly sure there's reward for your effort when searching for a box.<br/>
