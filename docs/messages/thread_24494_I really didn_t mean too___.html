<br/>
So this is what I am going to do with this planed series.<br/>
<br/>
It is going to be 5 boxes log, each box is going to be placed at a <br/>
point for different reasion, each will have a stamp and the final will <br/>
have a notebook. It will be listed as a series of 5 on LbNA unless they <br/>
say I cannot do it. Each box will have the clues for the next in it so <br/>
in order to find the final you will need to find all the boxes. I want <br/>
this to be a fun and educational experience and when the finder is done <br/>
they will have 5 stamps to boot.<br/>
<br/>
I will make it clear that there are some without logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
If LbNA has a problem with the logbook, than I will list it as 1 box, <br/>
but until I hear from them it will be a 5 box series.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that people will look for it when I am done I promise it will be <br/>
fun.<br/>

you know the funny thing about letterboxing?? it is<br/>
played how "YOU" want it played. you make the boxes<br/>
for others to find. you design the stamp. you make/buy<br/>
the logbook. you come up with the clever clues to hide<br/>
your box.<br/>
it is all up to "YOU" how you play the game. if you<br/>
want to plant boxes with NO logbooks, then do so. if<br/>
you want a series to have only one logbook at the end,<br/>
then do it that way. if you want same series to have<br/>
logs in every box, then do it that way. you are<br/>
creating these little treasures for us to find. and<br/>
for the most part, letterboxers are quite content to<br/>
find any sort of letterbox. just explain in the clues<br/>
how you are playing the game. no logs, or every box<br/>
has logs. but be prepared for the backlash if others<br/>
think you are straying from the norm.. we all have our<br/>
opinions, right or wrong...<br/>
so dont take it too personal.<br/>
then it is up to the letterboxers if they wish to find<br/>
these little gems you worked so hard to create. and i<br/>
bet you any amount of money that many boxers will<br/>
praise you for planting your letterboxes for all to<br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
and LBNA or AQ dont care how you create your boxes.<br/>
they only store the clues for us to find your boxes.<br/>
so make those gems and plant them and let us find<br/>
them. wish i lived in your area, so i could find these<br/>
"controversial" boxes you are going to plant.<br/>

This was discussed a year or so ago.  As soon as I saw your post I knew <br/>
some of the elitists would come a runnin'<br/>
<br/>
Do not fret over fostering controversy, it is good.  If we all agreed on <br/>
everything the world would be a pretty dull place.<br/>
&gt; So this is what I am going to do with this planed series.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is going to be 5 boxes log, each box is going to be placed at a <br/>
&gt; point for different reasion, each will have a stamp and the final will <br/>
&gt; have a notebook. It will be listed as a series of 5 on LbNA unless they <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will make it clear that there are some without logbooks.<br/>

&gt; If LbNA has a problem with the logbook, than I will list it as 1 box, <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope that people will look for it when I am done I promise it will be <br/>
&gt; fun.<br/>

<br/>
Don't worry about what others think of your plant.  If they don't like <br/>
the way you do it, then they don't have to search for it.<br/>
