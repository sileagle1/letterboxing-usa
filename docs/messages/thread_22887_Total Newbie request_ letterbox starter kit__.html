First question: I'd like to give Sissy a Letterbox Starter Kit as a<br/>

Second question: she's moving to Belgium late next summer - is there much<br/>
letterboxing around Brussels as yet??<br/>

<br/>
But I can tell you that if you want to put together a starter kit, here are <br/>
some things to include:<br/>
-a rubber stamp for her symbol.  Since she's your sister and presumably you <br/>
know her well, you can pick something out that she would like or want to use.  <br/>
She can always change this later if she decides to, but for her first trip <br/>
out, she'll need something to stamp in with.<br/>
-an inkpad for her to use to stamp her stamp into logbooks.<br/>
-a logbook.  Basically any kind of book without lines.  Artist sketchbooks <br/>
work well.  :)  You can buy them at bookstores like Borders or B&amp;N.<br/>
-something to carry it all in, like a backpack, if she doesn't have one.<br/>
-a compass.  And if she doesn't know how to use it, print out some directions <br/>
from a website.<br/>
-if you want to get fancy, an atlas of her area.  I have maps of every town <br/>
in CT, and they're PRICELESS for letterboxing.<br/>
-a sandwich-sized piece of Tupperware (or Tupperware-esque product)<br/>
-a spiral book of index cards<br/>
-some erasers for carving up<br/>
-if you want to get fancy, you can buy her carving tools at a craft store.<br/>
<br/>
That's all I can think of off the top of my head.  Anyone else?<br/>

There have been some wonderful posts on this and the newboxers list asking "What's in Your Pack" that I have gotten some great ideas from. Perhaps you can print one out for her. Also, there are suggestions on the LBNA website. I would hate to have had this hobby handed to me gift wrapped. I love how it is still evolving into my own (weird) thing. But that's just me. Randy Hall's book, the Letterboxers Companion, is a great gift idea, as someone else mentioned. Good Luck!<br/>

<br/>
There is a starter carving kit by "Speedball"!<br/>
<br/>
Does your sister work at the Teacher Supply Store in Lake Ridge <br/>
VA... the one that has a post office in the store????<br/>
<br/>
If so....  she is a nice lady and she made my day by complimenting <br/>
my carving. I was buying a padded envelope for The Annabel Lee <br/>
Postal Letterbox, my entry in the Edgar A Poe Postal Letterbox Ring. <br/>
It was set up inside a little cardboard jewelry style box and before <br/>
I stuffed it in the envelope your sister commented..."Good things <br/>
come in small packages..." so I opened it to reveal it was a lady in <br/>
a coffin inside ....<br/>
<br/>
The carving tools, "rubber" carving blocks, ink pads &amp; ink pens, and <br/>
various size sketch books are availlable at Michael's on Prince <br/>
William Parkway... nice leatherbound journal books are next store in <br/>
the Office Depot for $6. <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure any of the local letterboxers would be glad to help your <br/>
sister get started letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to pass along my email address.<br/>

There's only one letterbox I know about in Belguin; you can find the<br/>
clue at http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue.html?gBoxId=10333<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing activity--yes! "Much" letterboxing activity--no, not<br/>
really, but it only takes a couple of people to change that. ;o)<br/>

&gt; a starter kit, here are <br/>
&gt; some things to include:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -some erasers for carving up<br/>
<br/>
Please forget the erasers.  There are a precious few<br/>
erasers that are any good for carving, but most are<br/>
lousy.  And the ones that are any good are more<br/>
expensive and more difficult to find than good carving<br/>
rubber.  Just drop into Michael's and buy a 4x6 piece<br/>
of Speedy-Stamp (do NOT get Speedy-Cut!).  Be sure to<br/>
cut 1/8" off each end and throw it away.  Note that<br/>
Speedy-Stamp isn't among the rubberstamping stuff,<br/>
it's in the artist supply stuff on the opposite side<br/>
of the store.<br/>
<br/>
Or drop into JoAnn Fabrics and buy a 2.5x5 block of<br/>
MasterCarve.  Note that it's not among the<br/>
rubberstamping stuff, it's among the modelling clay<br/>
stuff.<br/>
