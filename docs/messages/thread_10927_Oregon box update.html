<br/>
It was a windy weekend in the good ol Columbia River Gorge, but I <br/>
managed to fight off the wind to go letterboxing, however, I wasn't <br/>
very successful in my searches...<br/>
<br/>
The first box, "Sandy Delta" placed by Funhog was a bit tricky.  I <br/>
wasn't able to find it on my first try, but I plan on going back in <br/>
the future...I've heard it's a tricky one.  I just couldn't seem to <br/>
find the yellow warning post at the end of the clue.<br/>
<br/>
The second box was a great find though!  I headed up the Wahkeena <br/>
Falls and found the box that Der Mad Stamper had originally placed, <br/>
but that Ryan has replaced.  <br/>
<br/>
The third box, again, stumped me.  I've heard this one is especially <br/>
tricky as well, but I could not find the Multnomah Falls box.  Of <br/>
course, my day for looking wasn't the greatest--it was Sunday and I <br/>
think there was some kind of tourist group of about 100 people <br/>
travelling up and down the falls, so I didn't want to make  <br/>
spectacle of myself looking for the box.  Again, this is another box <br/>
that I will return to, probably next month.<br/>
<br/>
I was happy to find at least one stamp, but was let down that I <br/>
wasn't crafty enough to find the other two yet :)  Alas, I will try <br/>
again.<br/>
