<div>I have added a new file to the LBNA "Files" 
section. It is in the 'Scoutdogs' file and titled "Giant". I'm very proud of it 
because it's the most detailed stamp I've ever created. After you sign in to the 
site using your yahoo ID and password, you can use the link below to take you 
directly to the image. </div>
<div>It was carved in 3 hours using PZ Cut and a #1 
Speedball tool (&amp; a magnifying glass!) The stamp is 2" x 4". I colored it 
with pencils. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>TO SEE IT FULL SIZE: When you open the file, put 
your cursor over the image till you see a square with arrows in each corner. If 
you click on that square, you'll be able to see the image full size. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let me know what you think. Helpful criticism 
accepted. It will be in a box in Cincinnati, hopefully soon :-)</div>
<div>Enjoy!</div>

I didn't think you could out do your Library image ...but I think you<br/>
have !<br/>
<br/>
That stamp (letterbox) will look good on the "Eastside" of Cincinnati..<br/>
