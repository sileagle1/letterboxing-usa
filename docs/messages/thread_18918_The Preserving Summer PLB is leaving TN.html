                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Postal Letterbox, "Preserving Summer," will be leaving Tennessee on May 26. It will begin its journey by going to the first person who signed up for this letterbox (Yeah, Music Woman!)...and will make its way from there across the country in sections, based on zip code. <br/>
<br/>
FYI...Preserving Summer is starting on the East Coast and heading west...while The Pickle Jar PLB, which went out last week, is headed generally from the West Coast eastward. Let me know if they show up in your mailbox! I'd love to hear of their travels!<br/>
