                    <div class="plaintext-content">With the spring like weather yesterday I took the oppurtunity to <br/>
finally plant the Mercy Brown, Exeter Vampire box. This is actually a <br/>
set of two boxes, one being a hitch hiker. The directions to the <br/>
Permanent box will follow, but first I must give credit where credit <br/>
is due. Thanks to three wonderful girls, my daughter, Renee, and from <br/>
Virginia, Boop and Katybug. It was their interest in this RI legend <br/>
that inspired me to do the boxes. These boxes are dedicated to the <br/>
three of them. Thanks girls.<br/>
Secondly, to Boop and Bug's mom, Ladybug. It's her poetry you've all <br/>
been enjoying, and hopefully you'll enjoy her stamp if you're lucky <br/>
enough to find the hitch hiker.<br/>
Lastly, over the last month or so, I've enjoyed hunting her boxes, <br/>
and working with her on some local letterboxing projects. Thanks to <br/>
Trish Kurdziel and her family. She carves a great stamp, and her work <br/>
on this project can be seen in the permanent box. Thanks again, to <br/>
all of you.<br/>
About the planting of the box; None of the above mentioned knew <br/>
anything about where the box was to be planted, outside of discussing <br/>
different places. It was I alone who decided on the hiding place and <br/>
I alone who planted the box. I wanted to keep it on a local level to <br/>
start, and therefore planted the box in a cemetery. To anyone this <br/>
might offend, my apologies.<br/>
To the rest of you, "tis an old church you'll be looking for, built <br/>
in 1838 I believe. You'll find it on Rt. 102 in Exeter, RI, <br/>
approximately three miles west of Rt. 2. I hope you take the time to <br/>
look over and enjoy the old Chestnut Hill Baptist Church. From the <br/>
church parking lot I suggest you walk down the center road of the <br/>
cemetery. You can also drive, but I think a walk would be more <br/>
pleasant. At the first big cedar tree you'll come to on your left <br/>
you'll find the Brown Family plot, with Mercy Lena centered amongst <br/>
her family. After looking over the stones there, take a right down to <br/>
the old building, built into the side of the hill, where Mercy was <br/>
first laid to rest, awaiting the spring thaw. From there, a left will <br/>
take you to a waist high, table sized rock near the back of the <br/>
property. At the base of this rock you'll find the Mercy Brown, <br/>
Exeter Vampire letterbox. Could this be the rock where they burned <br/>
Mercy's heart and lungs after determining she was a vampire? For <br/>
those not familiar with the story, see;<br/>

Final note; I know you all will use common sense and respect the <br/>
property, but it is my wish that letterboxing not be done on Sundays <br/>
at this location. Also, because some service or another might be <br/>
underway when and if you do decide to seek this box, I suggest <br/>
grabbing up the clues to some of the local boxes in this area. Thanks <br/>
and enjoy.<br/>
