Hike:  try and avoid summer as there is limited shade and most of the hike<br/>
is uphill.  No restrooms.<br/>
   From Kernville drive north on Mtn 99 for approximately 2 miles<br/>
passing Owens Boys Camp, then park on the right near the horse corrals and take the Cannell trail (33E32). After you go through the 2nd gate you will come to a rock outcropping covered in green lichen 33 paces from the gate. Continue along the trail and soon you will come to a saddle area. If you leave the trail you can walk south to an area that overlooks Kernville. Continuing along the trail you will come to a trail marker on the right side of the trail and at the end of the saddle area. Approximately 295 paces up the trail from the trail marker you come to a large squarish boulder on the right (northeast) side of the trail.On the northeast side of this large boulder is a smaller boulder.The letterbox is under some movable rocks on the northeast side of the smaller boulder below a  grayish boulder splotched with salmon pink coloration that overhangs the letterbox. The hike to the letterbox is approximately 1 1/2 miles round trip. If you continue past the letterbox this trail will take you to Pine Flat and crosses Cannell Creek twice before reaching Cannell Cabin, built around 1904. Hikers, horseback riders, mountain bikers and off road motorcycles share this trail. It is dog friendly. The usual warnings apply. Check yourself and your dogs for ticks as they don't really make very good housepets.<br/>

Many folks come to Kernville, look around, then remark "What a quaint old town". While the town is certainly quaint, it's location is fairly new. The town of  Kernville was moved to it's present location in the early 1950's when the dam was built and Lake Isabella created.So where is Old Kernville ? These letterbox directions will take you to a overlook of the "Old" Kernville and if water level allows , let you poke around some of the old foundations. For more details the many books by Bob Powers give the reader a wealth of information and this letterbox is planted in his honor for he was one of Old &amp; New Kernville's prominent citizens.<br/>
