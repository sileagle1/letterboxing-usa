&gt; sorta<br/>

Day of the Triffids is another good movie. Good candidate for a box. There was a letterbox Attack of the Killer Tomatoes at the Mansfield Monster Mash last October but that was only out for the month. Excellent choice for a letterbox but a god awful and long movie. Too crazy for me. Looks like we have a small group of B movie lovers in letterboxing.....Chuck and Molly<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very funny. Someone on the mid-atlantic board just did a Killer <br/>
Tomatoes and it was Triffids that I was thinking of. I can't remember <br/>
the names of the other films. One was about a group of people stuck <br/>
in a house surrounded by attacking huge alien tusked boars. The worst <br/>
was a sci-fi movie with the alien being represented by a guy dressed <br/>
in a gorilla suit and a plastic bubble helmet. Gosh I'd love to see <br/>
them again.<br/>

&gt; I LOVE the Bad Seed. It is one of my all time favorite movies. When <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; read the Killer Klown thread it popped into my mind and I <br/>
&gt; thought "that needs a box". I'll let that one rst and move on to <br/>
&gt; other 'bad' flicks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Has anybody every seen the cheesy 80's movie "Killer Klowns <br/>

has <br/>
