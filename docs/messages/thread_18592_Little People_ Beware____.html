Ryan, what does that PF stuff mean?  Can I plant a letterbox in my <br/>
own backyard?  Will the U.S. Postal Service get mad if I carve one of <br/>
their stamps?<br/>

<br/>
There are no little people on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed the joke, though.  =)  It seemed so heavy-handed, I <br/>
didn't think anyone would actually fall for it.  Especially since <br/>
I've never taken that attitude towards the other talk lists I really <br/>
am a moderator of.  But I've been reprimanded by Pandora for dumping <br/>
a "10 pound bag of crap" on her desk having to reply to all the <br/>
irate e-mails, so I guess it really did work.  Sorry about the <br/>
workload, Pandora.  I figured I'd get all the irate e-mails calling <br/>
me names and saying how evil I was!  (Didn't even get one.)<br/>
<br/>
But I didn't want the joke to go on for too long--didn't want to <br/>
scare anyone off the talk list before they realized it was a joke.<br/>
<br/>
Carpe diem!<br/>
