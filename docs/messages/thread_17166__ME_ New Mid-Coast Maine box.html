I'll be keeping it out until we take our family tree down, on <br/>
January 15, 2004. <br/>
<br/>
Take Route 27 off Route 1 toward Boothbay Harbor. Drive until <br/>
you get to the one and only stop light, and at that light take a left. <br/>
Follow Route 96 for a few miles, until you enter the tiny town of <br/>
East Boothbay, Maine.<br/>
<br/>
On your right you will see a sign for "Mill Cove Overlook." Turn <br/>
right on that tiny turnaround and park there, just off Rt. 96.<br/>
<br/>
Walk down to the crude wooden bench on the water's edge. Turn <br/>
right and walk about 20 steps. Turn right once more and walk 15 <br/>
steps. You will find the box under low hanging tree branches, <br/>
near a white stone.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very easy box, and great for kids. There is a winged <br/>
hitchhiker in the box for the first finder, if they should so want her<br/>
<br/>
Dress warm! Enjoy! Email me at amymisha@dialmaine.com if <br/>
there are any problems.<br/>
