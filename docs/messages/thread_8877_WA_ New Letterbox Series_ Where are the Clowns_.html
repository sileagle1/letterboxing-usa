Nov 2, 2002 Prior to the South Sound Gathering<br/>
Location: Fort Steilacoom Park Lakewood WA <br/>
Pierce County <br/>
<br/>
Additional Information: Bring clues for the Heath Farm Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
To the Letterboxes,<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 Fro Clown<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the State Hospital Memorial Cemetery sign. Go left along the path heading away from the road (the cemetery will be on your right). Past two towers to the next group and search behind and low,<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 Jolly Clown<br/>
<br/>
Back on the path continue along and go right at the intersection being sure to have the cemetery on your right. From the next official park sign you see stand at its left post and take a reading of approx. 130 degrees. You will see a cluster that hidden within is the letterbox. Check all over as it is hidden well.<br/>
<br/>
Box #3 Feets the Clown<br/>
<br/>
Walk back onto the path and head back toward the parking lot. When the curve in the gravel becomes evident and your path joins another; go left on less traveled trail. Keep walking straight. Do not turn or veer off this track. You will pass over an old road and into a sunken field. The goal is to find what appears to have been an old dirt road. Once you have found this road stop and look both ways. A larger log is visible from where you stand and hidden beneath it is the reward.<br/>
<br/>
Box #4 Weepy Clown<br/>
<br/>
This box was placed with the Secret Gardeners from Canada and we stumbled across another treasure while finding a home for the last clown. Therefore, find this letterbox by knocking on the neighbors doors of the Heath Farm Letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck! <br/>
