    From Rte 31  in Coventry turn onto  South River Road. ( Same way <br/>
to Ben E, Red bird and Truman Meadow letterboxes)  Follow South River <br/>
slowly. Pass the Hickory Ridge tree farm ,a little further down the <br/>
road you will see a small bridge ,pull off just after it. This is all <br/>
private land so please  stay on the road edge and don't disturb the <br/>
neighbors. <br/>
    Christmas morn 1974 dawned clear  and glistening in this <br/>
neighborhood . A coating of ice over every surface left a magical <br/>
look to the holiday dawn. Outside in the backyard I saw a beautiful <br/>
black Morgan horse glistening in icy tendrils herself. <br/>
    My Christmas miracle and a gift that lasted until spring of 2002. <br/>
This box commemorates my best friend Cindy - a little Morgan mare who <br/>
came and stayed ,taught my children to ride and my niece, and was <br/>
here for so many birthday parties and family functions. She is missed!<br/>
    Stand on the bridge take note of Harakaly and Allen and move to <br/>
the left of them all the way to the end of the gaurd rail. Stop here <br/>
and walk around the end to find a momento to a quiet little horse who <br/>
enjoyed a swim and bath in this very piece of the river.  This was <br/>
her place - a favorite stop on a ride to Truman meadow. Please return <br/>
to your car to stamp then seal the box tightly before hiding it in <br/>
the same spot. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
