going to be my first LB find but I didn't. :o( <br/>
<br/>
Of course I had my compass, stamp and book ready to go but came up <br/>
empty. Fortunately the location is one of my favorite spots on Earth <br/>
so I did enjoy that gift of course.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple other boxes nearer my home (in the Columbia River <br/>
Gorge) so I will try again!<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if there's been a recent North Head Lighthose LB <br/>
sighting. Thank you!<br/>
