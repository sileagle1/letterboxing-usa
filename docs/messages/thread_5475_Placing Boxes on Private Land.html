<br/>
As a newbie I tried searching this list's archives to see if this topic <br/>
might have been previously discussed.  I didn't find anything, but may not <br/>
have hit on the right word or phrase in my search search.<br/>
<br/>
I understand most letterboxes are placed on public land, and understand <br/>
why.  We have a small farm (180 acres) in the Finger Lakes region of NY <br/>
which includes a lovely wooded glen, a fairly substantial gorge and lots of <br/>
woodlands; we also border a state park.  We've been talking about placing <br/>
some boxes around the farm and making the clues available by invitation or <br/>
request, as well as possibly placing boxes in the adjoining state park (as <br/>
well as other public nearby areas) that would also include information <br/>
about obtaining the clues.  We welcome visitors to the farm, but would not <br/>
want throngs of folks, especially if we didn't know they were here.  Does <br/>
anyone know of similar set-ups?  What do you think of this idea, pro/con <br/>
(especially more experienced letterboxers)?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>
<br/>
Debbie T (the bee)<br/>

What a wonderful idea Debbie,
</p><p>      You have conceived a new kind of letterboxing
- the "requested access clue".  This reminds me of the sand permit
required on some national seashores for the purposes of knowing (and limiting)
the number of vehicles/people in an area at any given time.  It's
your land and if personal requests would be your terms for access, I say
thanks for sharing what sounds like some lovely scenes.  I remember
how lovely Chittenango Falls is and I imagine your area is similar?
</p><p>    What do others think?  It would probably be
wise to list clues or notices with <b>BOLD FACE NOTICE </b>of
your disclaimer for liability and instructions for advance notice. 
What would you do if 20 people appeared one Saturday morning? <b>
Or 50?</b>
</p><p>    Are you close to Clinton, NY?  I hope to visit
relatives there during the summer.
</p><p>Regards,
<br/>Susan Davis

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Thanks to all who replied to this inquiry!<br/>
<br/>
We've been talking this idea and the responses through, and looks like <br/>
we'll give it a shot.  We already have a fair number of folks visiting the <br/>
farm (yes, we own it, as Laurette asked - must be your friend Deb T knew <br/>
Debbie means "the bee", too!) as we have a 50 family Community Supported <br/>
Agriculture program.  20 people on weekend would probably be okay, but the <br/>
thought of 50 is a little frightening.  We'll talk to our insurance agent, <br/>
too, although in the past he's said that as long as we're not charging for <br/>
anything our current farm policy is fine.  For safety's sake we'd want to <br/>
know who and when folks are on the farm.  Hunting season would need to be <br/>
off limits, but other farm activities could be a neat addition to the <br/>
search - folks might enjoy watching a hay field mowed or baled as they walk <br/>
by, also scads of wildlife.<br/>
<br/>
We also want to place some boxes in some of the nearby state parks - so <br/>
we'll post again when we've got some hidden!<br/>
<br/>
And now, another question - what is the proper etiquette if you suspect <br/>
someone you encounter is also a letterboxer?  Do you ask, or is that <br/>
impolite (interrupting their search)?  Is it okay to stake out the parking <br/>
lot and wait for their return?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
Debbie<br/>
