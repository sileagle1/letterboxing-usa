<div>Thanks for the report. I got the double sided foam 
tape (Super Stick)  from a stamp site on the internet (Pigs Can 
Fly) and after 4-6 months, and at least 10 stamps, discovered that 
whatever is used in the glue it does not like the Speedball red stamp material. 
Hence the reaction you saw. The surface never sets and if the stamp is at an 
angle, will slide off the wooden back. The stuff works great on regular 
rubber used in stamps.  I have also used 3M paper thin, Dbl sided tape it 
works great. Not sure why. If you come across any more of my stamps like that 
just gently slide it back in place.</div>

<div>Just wanted to let you know that the 
  Honesty stamp seems to be suffering in the heat.  It is still usable, but 
  it is sliding off of the wooden handle.  I didn't want to risk harming 
  the stamp by trying to push it back together.  So, I just thought I'd let 
  you know.<br/><br/>Thanks again.  You were our first letterbox - The Runway 
  box at Gravelly Point.  We found it and were totally 
  hooked.<br/><br/>Coleen<br/>"Firefly"
