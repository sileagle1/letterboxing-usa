out and found Portsmouth Alarm. I know that there are so many more of <br/>
you out there just dying to go looking for this box. I found out that <br/>
on Monday, June 11th, it was the 1 year anniversary of the boxes first <br/>
find. One the anniversary of the first find, I had to replace the <br/>
logbook due to it being full. What a year this box has had, both good <br/>
and bad. The bad being, I had to replace the container twice due to <br/>
vandals smashing it. Other than that, I have heard nothing but awesome <br/>
things about the condition of the box and the place I have taken people <br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to encourage everyone else to visit this box.<br/>
It is one of my favorite and know it will also be one of yours.<br/>
