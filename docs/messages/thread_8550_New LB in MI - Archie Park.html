Archie Park Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Grand Traverse County, Michigan<br/>
Peninsula Township<br/>
Nearest City:  Traverse City<br/>
<br/>
Planted 10/20/02 by Webfoot, Treefrog, Cowgirl and Gramdar<br/>
<br/>
Just North of Traverse City on Old Mission Peninsula - good place for a<br/>
picnic lunch.  <br/>
<br/>
Almost exactly 5 miles North of the traffic light at the fork of Peninsula<br/>
Drive and M-37 on M-37 (also known as Center Road at this point), there is<br/>
a small park on the site of what used to be the community of Archie.  The<br/>
story of how Archie got its name remains shrouded in mystery, but we have<br/>
put our hypothesis into a letterbox hidden in the park.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
If you pump the pump for info, leave the handle up high.<br/>
It's pointing to a snag that's up the hill nearby.<br/>
It's tall, it's white, it's knotty and it aims for the sky;<br/>
The hiding place you seek is 'round the back, head high.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!!<br/>
