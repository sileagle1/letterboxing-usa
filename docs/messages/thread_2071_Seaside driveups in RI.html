<br/>
Narragansett Rhode Island hosts a hardworking commercial fishing <br/>
fleet and a beautifully gaunt summer colony in an area that feels <br/>
like the end of the world. We've spent alot of time there over the <br/>
years; lobstering, sailing, and skinny dipping. These three <br/>
letterboxes are all drive-ups. We hope you enjoy some of our old <br/>
haunts.<br/>
<br/>
The first in our Harbor of Refuge Series, "High Liner" is on the <br/>
beach in Galilee, Rhode Island, just south of Wakefield. From the <br/>
junction of RI Routes 1 and 108, drive south on Rte. 108 for about 2 <br/>
miles. Turn left on Burnside Ave and follow it to the end at <br/>
Scarborough Beach. Turn right (a left will bring you to the Kurdziel <br/>
Family's Midnight on the Moon letterbox) and follow Ocean Drive for <br/>
2.1 miles to turn right into the Camp Cronin Fishing Area.<br/>
<br/>
Park out at the end and follow the breakwater or cross the dunes to <br/>
find a lovely dark-sand beach. Turn north and follow the cove about <br/>
50 yards to an abandoned stone jetty made with old carved granite <br/>
blocks, remnants of a forgotten shoreside hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Along the northern edge, find a group of three large flat granite <br/>
pieces, each drilled with a hole, next to a short piling. The <br/>
northernmost block is cracked, leaving a perfect hiding place <br/>
underneath. This is one of those sites that will need careful <br/>
rehiding to avoid tide and waves moving the letterbox and sending it <br/>
out to sea like a message in a bottle.<br/>
<br/>
"Salty Brine" is a beloved Rhode Island television personality. From <br/>
High Liner, head back up to Rte. 108 and turn left at Iggy's on Sand <br/>
Hill Cove Rd and follow it past Wheeler State Beach into Galilee. The <br/>
road bends right in a one way loop to a stop sign. Turn left and <br/>
drive south along the waterfront to Salty Brine State Park. We think <br/>
this is the best place in the world to find "Johnny Cakes."<br/>
<br/>
There is a little state bungalow by the jetty with a small deck with <br/>
benches on the seaward side. Wait for your moment, then reach under <br/>
the northwest corner of the decking up against the shingles for your <br/>
reward. Maybe cover it a little with sand when you're done so it <br/>
doesn't show through the floorboards.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, return up Rte. 108 north to busy Wakefield and take Rte. 1 <br/>
south about 3.5 miles to the Jerusalem/Snug Harbor exit. Flip a u-<br/>
turn, then exit immediately right. Follow Succotash Rd south to the <br/>
bottom, then follow it as it curves north past a couple of docks on <br/>
the right. You'll see a large old decrepit pier with parking spots <br/>
looking across to Galilee.<br/>
<br/>
On the southern, landward side before the pier, look in the wooden <br/>
railings under a pile of asphalt rubble for the "Jerusalem" Letterbox.<br/>

These sound great.  I will have to try these on my way home from work <br/>
one day this week.  BTW, I may be new to RI but aren't Johnny Cakes <br/>
cornmeal pancakes that you eat for breakfast?<br/>
