You need to find a tree near the trail and climb high enough to be <br/>
able to cover the entire disturbed area. You also need a source of <br/>
water of course.<br/>
 I liked the suggestion about the yellow food coloring. I will <br/>
investigate the AMCE mini-snow gun food color attachment. Now, THAT <br/>
would raise a few eyebrows when the next hikers came along. I cant <br/>
believe that you experienced letterboxers didnt know about this <br/>
equipment, tsk, tsk.<br/>
