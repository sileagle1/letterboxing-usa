Well, I'm done! My kids and I have been so eager to get out and find <br/>
some letterboxes, but I wanted to get my signature stamp finished first <br/>
so that we had something to stamp in with. I'll have to say that I <br/>
thought at first that I had bit off more than I could chew... as the <br/>
image was fairly detailed. But after taking my time with it, I think it <br/>
turned out alright! Some of you seasoned carvers might give me some <br/>
suggestions or tips... I'd welcome any of them! (Thanks in advance....)<br/>
<br/>
ALSO.... I was wondering what you clean off stamps with after stamping? <br/>
Does it matter what you use? I used a baby wipe with oil in in; seemed <br/>
to work well. My only concern is will it damage the rubber? (I used a <br/>
Staedtler Mastercarve block.)<br/>

scented, which might attract animals. Not sure if this is an issue for your<br/>
personal stamp, since you won't be leaving it out where animals can get it, but<br/>
don't use the baby wipes on the hidden stamps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great stamp!  Yeah, oil can break down rubber over time, but don't know for sure about baby oil.  I just know from biking that oil such as chain lube has to be kept off rubber tires for that reason.  I don't have a high "F" count yet, probably only 12 or so, but out of those boxes, at least half had been chewed or even partially destroyed by animals here in PA, so scented things such as the baby wipes are definitely an issue.  When I hear about all these boxes that people find strewn about, I have to wonder how many have been left that way animals and not humans.  At least here, keeping them hidden from animals appears to be quite tough.  I think we still need to invent some tricks to improve the survival rate, and continue to remind people not to pick up a box after eating, etc.  I've also found several boxes with telltale food wrappers, cups, soda cans, etc. and tried to convince myself they couldn't possibly have been left by a letterboxer.  But some of them were suspiciously close to boxes that were off the beaten trail and even gave away the hiding place.  Be thoughtful out there, folks.  I'd like to think most of us are model conservationists. <br/>

  Well, I'm done! My kids and I have been so eager to get out and find <br/>

Absolutely gorgeous!! I had carved a stamp of a cat for a personal traveler and I have to say it in no way compares to yours! :(<br/>

But then I thought about it...and everyone's style is different! Your style is clearly artistic, beautiful, wonderful! Mine is comical! <br/>
