<br/>
What, oh, is it over?<br/>
<br/>
I know you are trying, really, and it is great to see you back at it, <br/>
but thirty minutes talking about a survey?  Huh?  And that bumper music, <br/>
uhg.  Do you really listen to that stuff?<br/>
<br/>
I think the idea of shorter segments is a really good one, it may keep <br/>
you and others interested.  This could have been divided into several <br/>
segments with something else in the episode.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure most of the comments are that it was wonderful, they always <br/>
are.  Just though I would give you an honest opinion.  Keep at it, you <br/>
have a great voice and sound very enthusiastic.<br/>
