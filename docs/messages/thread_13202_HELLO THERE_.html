How cool is it that this sport (is that what we call it?) satisfies <br/>
my love of riddles and snooping and rubberstamping!    <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here I am.  I am a neophyte Letterboxer but I had the great <br/>
experience of cutting the first of my babyteeth on the moor.  First <br/>
letterbox found in a Museum (is that cheating???) in Okehampton, <br/>
Dartmoor.  We found our next in the Plume &amp; Feather . . . a pub.  <br/>
Gotta love that.  <br/>
<br/>
We eventually wandered out onto the moor even though it was misty as <br/>
heck and the squish under our boots was NOT the marsh.  Hey, it's <br/>
gotta be love when a priss like me doesn't mind wading through horse <br/>
and sheep poodey looking for tupperware!<br/>
<br/>
All tolled we walked away from Dartmoor with 40 stamps in our <br/>
journals.  <br/>
<br/>
Next stop?  AMERICA!<br/>

What part of the US will you land in?  Some areas are richer in boxes than <br/>
others.<br/>

Love the boots! I would wear a pair of boots like that if I had to <br/>
wade through whatever "poody" to find some tupperware. You better <br/>
bring along the boots if your first stop is the east coast. The rainy <br/>
weather has turned a lot of places into marshes. If you ever go <br/>
hunting for boxes on the west coast(S.F. area)just drop me an e-mail <br/>
if you wish to do an exchange. Happy Hunting! <br/>

got to have the map discretely hidden. Otherwise you scream NOVICE!<br/>
If you're from GB then we'll let it slide. But if you're from the USA <br/>
then I'd say you are delightfully cheating! Have fun wherever you <br/>
land. <br/>
    The moors look ominous. I'm not to sure I'd feel comfortable <br/>
there. I'm for the pub crawling. The only thing that's scary there <br/>
are the leering drunks!<br/>
