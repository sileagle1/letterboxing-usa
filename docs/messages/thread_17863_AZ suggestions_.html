Was wondering if anyone had any suggestions for letterboxes in the area.  I've <br/>
never been to AZ before, so I don't know the area.  I know there are several on <br/>
the LBNA.org site for Sedona - but does anyone know if there are boxes close <br/>
to Sedona?<br/>
<br/>
Also, we are taking a side trip to the Grand Canyon.  Can't wait!!!<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated!  Thanks!<br/>

Amanda's "Southwestern Trio of Letterboxes" are pretty close to<br/>
Sedona, and reather pleasant.  I just did those not too long ago.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite letterbox is the "Superstitions Letterbox 1", but you've<br/>
got to really be into steep trails to get to that one.<br/>
