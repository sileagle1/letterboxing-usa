I have a question for the letterboxing community.  Recently I  have received <br/>
notification that two of my boxes have been found.   They're both planted in <br/>
NE Ohio.  The first one, I had planted  December 31st 2005, and in February <br/>
received notification that someone had  located it on January 2, 2006.  I figured <br/>
the person must go in  periodically and update their finds, thus the 1 month <br/>
delay in  notification.  However, when I checked the box there was no log of a <br/>
 finder.  The second occurrence of this just happened this week.   It was for <br/>
a box I had planted October 25, 2005.  When I received  notification, it <br/>
shows the box was found in July.  So I knew that  wasn't possible.  When I checked <br/>
the box there was no stamp from the  person who hand sent the notification. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had this occur to them?  I'm wondering if these  folks <br/>
updated my boxes as a find, and updated the incorrect box?  Not  a big issue, just <br/>
one of those things that make you say hmmmm that's  strange.  <br/>

You're probably right about the second case. They probably just <br/>
logged the wrong box.<br/>
