Midcoast Maine Brunswick/Harpswell-Boothbay Harbor are wonderful places to explore. Popham Beach, at the mouth of the Kennebec River is great for body surfing, sunbathing, hiking; Morse Mountain is a quiet hike with lots of birding; Fort Baldwin &amp; Fort Popham are great places to explore all within 3 miles of each other.  The Maine Festival featuring Maine only artists takes place at Thomas Point  Beach August 2-4<br/>
<br/>
Boothbay is a wonderful town with whale watching tours and lots of neat little shops and outdoor cafes.  Although Bailey Island in Harpswell is quite touristy, the Giant Staircase is a unique natural Maine phenomen.  Freeport/Pownal has Bradbury Mtn and Wolf Neck State Park, Falmouth has Mackworth Island, and Audubon Sanctuary.  Cundy's Harbor in Harpswell has a nice working fishing community with Estees III to eat right on the dock.Letterboxers and geocachers will be kept quite busy between Falmouth-Boothbay.  Enjoy your trip.<br/>
