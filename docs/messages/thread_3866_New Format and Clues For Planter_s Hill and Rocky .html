<p>Letterboxing, like any outdoor 
sport, carries the risk of unforeseen hazards.  "Letterboxing North 
America" supports a policy of not knowingly placing letterboxes in areas that 
will create undue risk to the letterbox hunter.  However, as conditions may 
vary, it is the responsibility of the letterbox searcher to become thoroughly 
familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare 
for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly with respect 
to those conditions and with respect to his or her personal abilities and 
limitations.  "Letterboxing North America" and the individual letterbox 
sponsors assume no liability for events, which may occur, related directly or 
indirectly to one's searching for a letterbox.  </p>
<p>Do not let children hunt for 
letterboxes unsupervised.</p><span>By
