                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think stamp pads in letterboxes is a personal preference of the<br/>
placer.  Mine do not have pads in them (unless others have put them<br/>
there).  The climate can be wet out this way (surprise, surprise) and<br/>
sometimes my boxes have gotten waterlogged, so I leave it up to the<br/>
stamper to bring their own inking device, myself.<br/>
<br/>
I notice that the Pacific NW letterboxers out here that I've hung out<br/>
with on a couple of occasions don't trust fate and they are<br/>
sophisticated in their methods, They bring a variety of different<br/>
colored inks along with them and figure out what is best suited to the<br/>
stamp.  As for me I just carry around the same dull blue dye pad from<br/>
place to place.<br/>
<br/>
One letterbox I've had the priviege of finding out here DID have a stamp<br/>
pad in it.  It was the Wolf Mystery Box in Washington placed by Lonemass<br/>
Wolf, so it may be more New England than NW.  Regional tastes, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day.  Happy letterboxing to all.  One of these days I'll<br/>
have to get out finding and placing.  Wolf Mystery Box and Angel's Rest<br/>
were the last ones I got, I think.  We did do Eagle Creek in the Gorge,<br/>
but I didn't have my letterboxing stuff with me on that hike.  Bummer,<br/>
bummer.  A missed opportunity for another big game stamp in Ryan's<br/>
African Safari series.<br/>
<br/>
Funhog has a ton of great letterboxes out here.  Lately other outdoor<br/>
activities have been taking priority, but I'm just going to have to find<br/>
time for my old love Letterboxing again!<br/>
