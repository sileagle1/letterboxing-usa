     I just joined this list about 3 weeks ago. and have been getting all <br/>
the posts in my e-mail. I really do not know what the big deal is about <br/>
joining or not joining. there does not seem to be a lot of spamming going on <br/>
and there does not seem to be a lot of people who dont join and post <br/>
letters.<br/>
     so I think you should keep it open just to encourage people to <br/>
participate. I work in the computer buisness and I know lots of people who <br/>
are leary about joining things just to participate. where we take for <br/>
granted the joining a list other people especially the kind who are not as <br/>
good with or knowlegeble about computers get parinoid or confused about <br/>
these types of things.<br/>

<br/>
On another note I just started letterboxing and am having a great tim I plan <br/>
to go look for some more this weekend!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Randy has mentioned several<br/>
&gt; &gt;  times the possibility of making this a 'members only can post'<br/>
&gt;list. There<br/>
&gt; &gt;  are pros and cons. He would possibly be willing to try it if a<br/>
&gt;majority of<br/>
&gt; &gt;  the list members voted in favor.<br/>

&gt; &gt; HI, I'd hate to see that happen.  The way it is now a newcomer to<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing can post to the list just for inquiries or someone who<br/>
&gt;has only<br/>
&gt; &gt; occasional computer access can post.  Members only might deter a<br/>
&gt;lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; folks.  .....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just my two cents.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; :o)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mohmers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would like to see the list become members only to post.<br/>
&gt;A curious non-member can still read the posts and get an idea of what<br/>
&gt;letterboxing is all about. Then, if interested, can join and post<br/>
&gt;with the rest of the MEMBERS!<br/>
