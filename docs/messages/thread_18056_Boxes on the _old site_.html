<br/>
Since Nevada boxes are kind of few in number (althoughb I am working to change this!), I <br/>
had gone to the old site and picked up a few additional clue sheets for other Nevada <br/>
boxes.  Yesterday we went out in search of the Goldfish Letterbox at Red Rock Canyon, <br/>
however, it appears to be missing (great location, tho).  The former One-Armed Bandit, <br/>
also listed on the old site and replaced by me, was also missing when I searched for it, so I <br/>
guess my question is, are the boxes listed on the old site to be considered MIA for the <br/>
most part?<br/>
<br/>
Waaah...I haven't been very successful lately.  Still getting over the three-day, Seattle <br/>
Walking Tour bust ;-).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

That's about it.  I know those two boxes were missing which is why <br/>
they aren't on the new website, but when in doubt, you could always e-<br/>
mail the placer to find out if the box might really be there or not.<br/>

unclaimed boxes for all of my surrounding states when the <br/>
website changed over.  Other states like MT and UT were very <br/>
responsive, but NV was one of the ones that I really didn't hear <br/>
much back from.  I don't think many have been maintained.<br/>
<br/>
Keep planting and more will come.  NV is also one of those <br/>
states that gets lots of travelers passing through, so you can still <br/>
have some traffic.  If you need more boxes, we are slowly adding <br/>
to the ranks in UT, ID, and AZ :)  Nevada will come too.<br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>
