I've been letterboxing for about 6 months. I really enjoy finding <br/>
boxes and the art in carving the stamps. I'll be placing a microbox <br/>
in Chichen Itza, Mexico this week. It's a popular spot to visit <br/>
Mayan ruins. I will possibly never return to check on the box, but <br/>
it would be interesting to hear from anyone who visits there via E-<br/>
mail. Would that be the ultimate "First to Find"? I promise to carve <br/>
a nice stamp....and I'll leave a rare coin for the first finder. <br/>
I'll be posting the clues after the 23rd of June when I return.<br/>
Keep those boxes coming...<br/>

  Hi folks,<br/>
  I've been letterboxing for about 6 months. I really enjoy finding <br/>
  boxes and the art in carving the stamps. I'll be placing a microbox <br/>
  in Chichen Itza, Mexico this week. It's a popular spot to visit <br/>
  Mayan ruins. I will possibly never return to check on the box, but <br/>
  it would be interesting to hear from anyone who visits there via E-<br/>
  mail. Would that be the ultimate "First to Find"? I promise to carve <br/>
  a nice stamp....and I'll leave a rare coin for the first finder. <br/>
  I'll be posting the clues after the 23rd of June when I return.<br/>
  Keep those boxes coming...<br/>

first planter in Mexico.  I live in Mexico City, and was hoping for <br/>
the same honor myself, but someone beat me to it.  There was a <br/>
posting for a box in Cozumel 5/31 on the LB Announce list.<br/>
<br/>
But have a great time in Chichen Itza--it's a terrific site--and <br/>
leave your box anyway.  Be sure visit Uxmal while you're in the <br/>
area.  We actually preferred it to Chichen Itza because it wasn't as <br/>
crowded.<br/>
