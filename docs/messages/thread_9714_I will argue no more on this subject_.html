                    <html><body><p>I said yesterday that I would air my opinion on the Purple Heart Letterbox subject when I had more answers.  For the name to be changed on this letterbox, the whole box with the hand carved stamp, and log book would have to be thrown out along with his web page and make a new one. It just can't have a quick fix. The book cover is even laminated. We do have different opinions on the name. My answer is that I am not going to throw out another boxers work. If I get a mailing address from Psychomommy, I will mail it to her. If not, it stays here. Too much has been said already. Calling a person ignorant isn't the best way to debate, neither is questioning anybodys patriotism. I was biting at the bit to reply several times. The box's owner had good intentions. I thank him for making it and giving it to me to start it off. I will not argue about this box or reply to any posts on this subject. I am not afraid to argue or state my opinion but this is doing the hobby no good. It all boils down to the fact that the box owner is the only person that can decide what he wants when making a letterbox and what to do with it. Let's end this as friends and fellow letterboxers and in the spirit of Christmas, lets have peace for the holidays at least in the letterboxing world. Happy Holidays to all.....Chuck and Molly</p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>
