                    <html><body>Yea... I found out this morning that my VW Jetta isn'[t a snowmobile either!  I was driving through Meshomasic State Forest, trying to put bonus box info in a box that I had placed and couldn't get up the hill on Del Reeves Road!  (I was trying to go the short way, rather than doing the two hour hike through!) Thank goodness that when I slid back down the hill, I didn't fall into a gully!  If I am going to keep with this hobby, I think my next car will be an SUV!<br/>
