  A School Nurse has written the info below -- good enough to<br/>
share -- And it really works!! I had a pediatrician tell me what she<br/>
believes is the best way to remove a tick. This is great, because it<br/>
works in those places where it's sometimes difficult to get to with<br/>
tweezers: between toes, in the middle of a head full of dark hair, etc.<br/>
Apply a glob of liquid soap to a cotton ball. Cover the tick with the<br/>
soap-soaked cotton ball and let it stay on the repulsive insect for a<br/>
few seconds (15-20), after which the tick will come out on it's own and be stuck to the cotton ball when you lift it away. This technique has worked every time I've used it (and that was frequently), and it's much less traumatic for the patient and easier for me. Unless someone is allergic to soap, I can't see that this would be damaging in any way. I even had my doctor's wife call me for advice because she had one stuck to her back and she couldn't reach it with tweezers. She used this method and immediately called me back to say, "It worked!" <br/>

pull out. That straightens the pinchers and they come outthe way they go in. <br/>

<br/>
Remove a tick from your skin as soon as you notice it. Use fine-tipped<br/>

your skin with soap and warm water. Throw the dead tick away with your<br/>

Avoid crushing the tick's body. Do not be alarmed if the tick's<br/>

the rest of the tick, it can no longer transmit the Lyme disease<br/>
bacteria. If you accidentally crush the tick, clean your skin with<br/>
soap and warm water or alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
Don't use petroleum jelly, a hot match, nail polish, or other products<br/>
to remove a tick.<br/>
