Since Waldenrun's link to the clues no longer works, and Waldenrun is <br/>
unreachable, I have re-typed the clues from an old hard copy that I <br/>
happened to have in my backpack.<br/>
<br/>
Since I do not know if this is considered poor form to repost clues <br/>
to another's letterbox, I apologize in advance.  If this is <br/>
considered a random act of letterboxing kindness, then perhaps the <br/>
webmaster can post these clues to the Piece of Cake letterbox in <br/>
place of the dead link.<br/>
<br/>
And, again, if ANYONE has ever found this letterbox, please email me <br/>
at WarriorInGilead@yahoo.com.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Piece of Cake Letterbox<br/>
Hopkinton, MA, Middlesex County<br/>
Placed January 10, 2002 by Waldenrun<br/>
Terrain:  One brief climb with generally good footing<br/>
Clues:  Piece of cake!<br/>
<br/>
This is our first plant.  I built the box for my son for his <br/>
birthday.  The round trip can be made in less than an hour and should <br/>
be fine with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Make your way to the HEADQUARTERS for Hopkinton State Park.  SMOKEY <br/>
will be waiting there for you but will not give you a ticket.  Once <br/>
you park, you can pick up a trail map outside the office but it may <br/>
not be of that much use to you.<br/>
<br/>
A wide trail heads west out of the parking lot and through a gate.  A <br/>
short ways up, a trail branches off to the right.  Stay on the DUCK <br/>
POND trail.  Travel through the pines and you will come upon a solid <br/>
BRIDGE.  The stream here empties out of a large swamp on your left <br/>
and feeds Hopkinton Reservoir to your right.<br/>
<br/>
Do not cross the BRIDGE, but instead take the GLEBE trail north along <br/>
the east side of the stream.  As you continue on, you will catch <br/>
glimpses of the backwaters of Hopkinton Reservoir.  There may be a <br/>
broad pond, or rocky mud flats, depending on water levels.<br/>
<br/>
Take the first trail on your right, just before you pass a large <br/>
boulder with a pyramid top.  This trail makes a relatively short but <br/>
somewhat steep climb to a broad expanse of OPEN ROCK.  The view is <br/>
limited by surrounding trees but it is a nice place to pause and let <br/>
your heart rate slow back down.<br/>
<br/>
Across the open space, the trail continues.  Step down and pause by <br/>
the opposing blue markers.  Looking straight down the trail, turn <br/>
toward the right.  You will see a SLICE OF BIRTHDAY CAKE sitting off <br/>
in the woods.  Take a couple dozen paces out to it and enjoy your <br/>
treat.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the trail, head down the hill and intersect with the <br/>
main trail.  Go left to return to the parking lot.  The park has many <br/>
more trails, and swimming beaches on the reservoir.  Winter <br/>
activities include cross-country skiing, ice fishing, and even a bit <br/>
of snowmobiling.<br/>
