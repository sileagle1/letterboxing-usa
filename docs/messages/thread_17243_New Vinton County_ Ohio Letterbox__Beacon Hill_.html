Location: Bobblett Cemetery, Old Rt. 50, AKA Co. Rd. 13A, Vinton <br/>
County Ohio {between Londonderry and Allensville, Ohio).          <br/>
This letterbox is not hidden on a hill as I had originally planned; <br/>
however, it is in an area surrounded by beautiful hills.   CLUES: <br/>
Find a blue water pump next to a white flag pole, basically right in <br/>
the center of the cemetery. Standing just south of the pump, take a <br/>
compass reading of 232 degrees. Go 23 paces at this heading to a <br/>
large, tree-like evergreen shrub. The box is hidden in a crotch <br/>
formed by several of the "tree/shrub"'s thin trunks, under some <br/>
small rocks and branches. (Small, camo-taped container).<br/>
