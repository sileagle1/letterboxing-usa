Well, it was changed recently so the downloaded file is specified as <br/>
a CSV file instead of as an HTML file (which is what it was using as <br/>
default before!) Which, when you get right down to it, was flat out <br/>
incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
There are settings on every computer that link certain file types to <br/>
certain programs, and for most people, opening a CSV file will cause <br/>
your operating system to suggest using Excel. Usually you can <br/>
override this, though I'm goofing around in England at the moment <br/>
and don't really have time to look up exactly the steps necessary to <br/>
accomplish this.<br/>
<br/>
You could also open in the file in Excel and save it as a text file <br/>
easily enough as well.<br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell, though, it's not the website, it's your computer. It <br/>
thinks CSV files should be loaded in Excel (which is *usually* what <br/>
most people want), but you want something else to happen. That <br/>
requires changing settings on your computer to change.<br/>

<br/>
Easiest way to work with the file: right click on the "Export Box <br/>
Info" link on the site, then select "Save Target As..." or "Save Link <br/>
As..." from the popup menu. Then save the file to your computer -- <br/>
and change the extension to .TXT if you'd like. Then open the file <br/>
you saved to your computer using your text editor (Notepad).<br/>
