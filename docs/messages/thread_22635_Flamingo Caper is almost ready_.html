<br/>
The Lazy Letterboxer has not been living up to her name. Leominster,<br/>
MA is a flurry of activity, and she's been non-stop for days!<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to spending the day with you all this Saturday,<br/>
October 1. Just a few reminders:<br/>
<br/>
* Meet us in the parking lot of the National Plastics Museum [see<br/>
Atlas Quest link below to sign up if you haven't and for more info!]<br/>
at 9am.<br/>
<br/>
* NO CLUES WILL BE HANDED OUT BEFORE 9am. You will understand why<br/>
once you begin your hunt. You may arrive before 9 to greet/exchange<br/>
with others, buy your raffle tickets, make up your car pool, buy a<br/>
boxing band, etc.<br/>
<br/>
* Don't forget a potluck item that you can leave with us before you<br/>
register for your clue dossier.<br/>
<br/>
* We encourage you buddying up with others for fuel conservation and<br/>
to help limit traffic. Your cars left behind in the parking lot will<br/>
be safe. There will always be someone there at the museum.<br/>
<br/>
* You MUST stop your search at 2pm and report back to the Plastics<br/>
Museum, (follow signs in the building for our room's location) where<br/>
the potluck will begin at 2pm, raffle at 3pm and we MUST leave the<br/>
building by 4pm - since this is when the museum closes.<br/>
<br/>
* Lastly, SAVE ALL OF THE PAPERS IN YOUR CLUE DOSSIER UNTIL THE<br/>
RAFFLE! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there and find Percival, Luvvy's pink<br/>
plastic flamingo!!!<br/>
