                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I said I would tell more details of my trip abroad as they relate to<br/>
letterboxing.  I searched for several boxes that had been planted by the<br/>
same person, and I came to the decision that I would never look for a box<br/>
that person did again.  Every single one was in a bad location, and somewhat<br/>
questionable judgement, and missing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, lest I begin a new battle . . . I fully recognize my own responsibility<br/>
in choosing where to go and where not to go.  Please don't take this as an<br/>
offense.  I really recognize my own culpability, so don't write back with<br/>
flames.  I'm pointing fingers at me as much as anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the Paris boxes, with one exception, were planted in neighborhoods<br/>
well out of the way.  I think part of the reason I ended up looking for one<br/>
of them that I shouldn't have was that I had already come so far to find it.<br/>
I didn't want to finally turn back again after spending money on metro<br/>
tickets and walking clear out.  One box had me go out behind an old church<br/>
and said to climb over a wall and go into a tunnel for an abandoned railway<br/>
line.  I shouldn't have gone, the wall turned out to be much higher than I<br/>
thought and I'm not convinced that I didn't break some law, although there<br/>
weren't signs posted.  Well, the tunnel turned out to be much longer than I<br/>
thought it would be.  I had to go clear into the dark (the clue had advised<br/>
to bring my "torch" so I was glad I had a flashlight).  It was only as I<br/>
really got out there that it started to sink in that if something were to<br/>
happen to me that there wasn't a soul who knew where I was, and there<br/>
probably wouldn't be anyone coming by that area in a long time since it was<br/>
all closed down.  Not smart on my part.<br/>
<br/>
I had to climb up these old ladders built into the tunnel wall.  Well, the<br/>
ladders were soooo tall.  I'm not afraid of heights, but that one caught my<br/>
breath.  My arms really ached after climbing up and back.  Again, stupid on<br/>
my part to go, but after getting that far, I really wanted to find the box.<br/>
It was my third attempt to find one in Paris (and my third failure to find<br/>
one) and I had spent the whole day looking for boxes I never found.<br/>
<br/>
When I finally gave up and went back to the wall, I was climbing over when<br/>
some French guys spotted me and came over and started saying something to me<br/>
in French.  These weren't the nicest looking guys.  I had tried to avoid<br/>
being seen but missed.  They kept saying something, so I explained that I<br/>
didn't speak French and they translated a few of the words they knew in<br/>
English.  It was enough for me to guess that they may have been attempting<br/>
to blackmail me after seeing me climb over the wall.  I think they were<br/>
threatening me.  I stayed there for a moment then just went with my gut<br/>
instinct and said "I'm sorry I don't understand French" several times then<br/>
walked back to the street very quickly.  Luckily, they didn't follow.  My<br/>
heart was pounding.  I won't go out to a questionable spot alone again.  I<br/>
shouldn't have ever climbed the wall, but I was pretty annoyed at the box<br/>
having been placed there at all.<br/>
<br/>
Two days later I made an attempt on the last box I had left in my list of<br/>
five Paris letterboxes.  It again took me way out of my way into an<br/>
industrial area residential neighborhood.  It wasn't the nicest area, but it<br/>
felt okay safety-wise.  I walked clear out to find it.  The clue said it was<br/>
hidden in the ridge of a lamp, but that you didn't need to climb the pole,<br/>
you could get the box from the top of the wall.  Well, when I got there the<br/>
lamppost was somewhere near 20-25 feet high and the wall was well above my<br/>
head as well at it's lowest point.  I couldn't believe it.  Every one of<br/>
this person's clues involved massive height and possibly getting in trouble<br/>
to get there.  I looked at the spot, then getting some sense, I turned<br/>
around and walked away without even trying.  I was ticked that I spent a<br/>
significant portion of my vacation running around areas that weren't worth<br/>
seeing to look for nothing.  Oh well, those are the chances we take, I<br/>
guess.  At least I still enjoyed the other parts of the city.<br/>
<br/>
I actually had much better luck in Jerusalem.  There weren't any boxes yet<br/>
from what I could find.  I had decided not to make a plant unless I knew it<br/>
was in a safe, respectful spot, but I didn't think I would find one.  What I<br/>
hadn't anticipated was finding a wonderful shopkeeper that would be totally<br/>
excited to be involved.  I hadn't thought of an indoor box.<br/>
<br/>
I went to buy some carvings at a shop that many of my friends who had<br/>
studied in Jerusalem recommended.  My university has a small campus for an<br/>
exchange program there and they have built a good reputation in the<br/>
community, but with the current situation, there hasn't been a studentbody<br/>
there for a while.  I went to the shopkeeper (he goes by Baghdadi) for some<br/>
olive wood carvings and saw that he had many wedding invites and business<br/>
cards around the shop from many who studied abroad through my university.<br/>
He was so excited when he found out how I knew who he was.  It also helped<br/>
that I came in with my friends that I was visiting.  They are a very well<br/>
respected family in the Muslim community.  After I had bought my things.  I<br/>
explained letterboxing to the shopkeeper and he was excited to let me leave<br/>
a box there, and he wanted to write "God bless you," in Arabic, in the logs<br/>
of those who stamp in.  He was so nice to me and seemed genuinely excited,<br/>
so to show my gratitude I named the letterbox "Baghdadi's letterbox", in his<br/>
honor.  I know tourism has died there, but I hope that some will go find the<br/>
box and support his business while they are at it.<br/>
<br/>
So that was my pleasant surprise.  I was able to make a Jerusalem plant, one<br/>
that I believe is the first letterbox in the country, in a way that is<br/>
totally safe for all involved without disrespecting a cultural or religious<br/>
landmark.  I'm pretty tickled with the result.<br/>
<br/>
This has turned into a ridiculously long post, so I will say goodnight.  I<br/>
just wanted to catch everyone up.  My trip was wonderful and I am so glad I<br/>
went.  Just seeing my friend at her wedding was reason enough to have gone,<br/>
even if I hadn't seen a thing.  I just hope there will be peace sometime<br/>
soon-actually, that's what is on the stamp I carved.  I had chosen the<br/>
design before someone else suggested it.  It is a dove with an olive branch<br/>
in it's mouth.  Hopefully there will be peace again so I can return and do<br/>
the city sights justice.<br/>
<br/>
Until later,<br/>
