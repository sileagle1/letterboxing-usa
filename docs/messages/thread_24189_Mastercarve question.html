                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI there!<br/>
I just carved a stamp on a Mastercarve block.  I carved it on the <br/>
white side, not the side with the blue words on it.  But, there was a <br/>
white on white logo on the side I carved on.   The image came out <br/>
okay, but when I stamp in, the left over bits of the logo are making <br/>
my image stamp irregularly.  The logo part isn't picking up the ink <br/>
as well as the rest of the material.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't think to sand it ahead of time.  I tried sanding a little <br/>
now, but the images has some fine pieces and I don't want to mess it <br/>
up.  I just screwed it up a little bit as it is.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyway to fix this problem so the material inks up properly <br/>
everywhere?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advise!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
