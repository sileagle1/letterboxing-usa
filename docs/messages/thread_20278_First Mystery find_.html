Got what I THINK is a pretty good idea on another MA Mystery box, but <br/>
won't have time to check it out anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
Another one that is intriguing is "Teacher's worst Nightmare." Only <br/>
read through it 3 times and always with the kids running around, but <br/>
so far NO clue on that. <br/>
<br/>
Gotta admit the MB's are pretty cool, but I also still enjoy the <br/>
slightly less challenging that still require some orienteering but <br/>
where the starting clues are more obvious on.<br/>
<br/>
And I enjoy the real simple ones that involvee nice hikes....<br/>

Lots of fun to be had in this hobby, to be sure. <br/>

I love to find the boxes that are less frustrating during times like these, just to prove to myself that I can still find a box at all!!!  (grin)<br/>

<br/>
OK probably old hat for alot of you but WE thought it was kinda cool.<br/>
<br/>
"Peace Seeker" in Massachusetts was the box BTW.<br/>
<br/>
Also found two other boxes, "Blueberry Confusion" and "Joe's Rock," <br/>
and a HH "X marks the spot," in one of these and moved him along.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty good day!<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, probably pretty boring to most of you, but we're  only <br/>
up to 7 finds, so being the FF on a Mystery box was nice!<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I'd share. :-)<br/>

"A Teacher's Worst Nightmare" LB is the only mystery box that I've <br/>
ever placed!  I'm excited to see it mentioned here and wish you luck <br/>
in finding it.....a few people have already.  I wanted my clue to <br/>
rival Wanda and Pete's "Dancing Men" but don't think I even came <br/>
close.  That's okay...just glad to see that it's providing some <br/>
entertainment for a few people! <grin><br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the mention....happy hunting,<br/>

P.S.  While out doing some maintenance on my "Camping Memories" <br/>
series, my cousin and I got the unexpected pleasure of meeting Wanda <br/>
and Pete....I think those two stamps are my absolute favorite, now!!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Another one that is intriguing is "Teacher's worst Nightmare." Only <br/>
&gt; read through it 3 times and always with the kids running around, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; so far NO clue on that. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Nicely done. Shows alot of thought and creativity. <br/>

Haven't seen "dancing men" yet. Have to look at that too.<br/>

Glad I could help make your day.<br/>

I am also proud to say that we did find "Dancing Men" this past <br/>
spring....my four-year-old godson even did the happy dance on the <br/>
spot. It only took us three weeks of searching....mystery boxes!  <br/>
Fun but frustrating sometimes....it feels good to go back to <br/>
the "regular" ones so that you remember how to actually find a box <br/>
and stamp in!<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
