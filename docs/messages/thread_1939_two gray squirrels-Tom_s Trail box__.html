                    <html><body>Hi!    I am at an unfamilar computer while here in MD. for a funeral..so if 
<br/>this comes to you looking "funny" you will know why! Today in memory of my 
<br/>friend and step mother who passed a few days ago i went out on a Maryland 
<br/>letterbox journey.Found 7 of your boxes but i must be blind because i could 
<br/>not locate Sligo Creek's Short Log...(how sort is that log?? and how far into 
<br/>the woods??..) Thank you for the great day i had ..need to let you know that 
<br/>Tom's Trail box needs to be saved and fast. When i found it today it was full 
<br/>of water with chunks of ice attached.Of course today would be the day that i 
<br/>did not have paper towels  with me so i dried the inside of the box out with 
<br/>my shirt( the top is broken) and dried the cover of the book as best i could 
<br/>but the book is soaked through.I took the liberty to carry away with me your 
<br/>ruined plastic bag and the destroyed sheets about letterboxing..i used a 
<br/>plastic bag i had with me to put your book in till you can get to it.The 
<br/>stamp of course is fine.Thanks for the fine day of "memories"...    see joy</body></html>
