B-The Weekend Warrior went out today 11/3/03 only could find "Timon" <br/>
the box was wet, she tried to dry it out, book intact, but damp... <br/>
could not find other 3 boxes, ALSO Friendly skies is wedged in too <br/>
tightly with a rock--couldn't get to it....<br/>

&gt; &gt; We found the first three boxes on 9-7-2003 and were pretty sure <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; last one was missing, probably in the water!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi, Has anyone been to Merrow park recently? I received an email <br/>
&gt; &gt; saying the last two boxes in the Circle of Life series were <br/>
missing. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Can anyone else confirm this? I'd like to know before I drive out <br/>
&gt; &gt; that far to replace them. Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Bluebird and I were there on Oct 16 and were not able to find the<br/>
&gt; last two boxes.  <br/>
