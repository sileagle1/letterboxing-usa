Directions: From RT.66 in Columbia turn onto Hunt RD. follow the boat<br/>
ramp signs.You will travel down this road 1.7 miles,there will be a stop<br/>
sign in the middle of this road but just keep going straight after<br/>
stopping.You will pass by a dam on your right and just after that is the<br/>
entrance to Mono Pond where you pull into the parking area,drive to the<br/>
bulletin board and park.( Wear orange blaze during hunting season)Enter<br/>
the yellow blaze trail and you will come to a Y go straight and stay on<br/>
the yellow in a little while you will pass through a stone wall,and then<br/>
you will pass through another stone wall.Then there will be a Y in the<br/>
trail take a right and go through a third stone wall.Continue a bit more<br/>
and you will see a trail feeding into this one coming from the left,they<br/>
both join together and the trail changes to red.You will pass over a<br/>
rocky and muddy area and cross a small stream keep going a little<br/>
more.Stay on the red trail and you will cross over another small stream<br/>
and then a little bigger stream that breaks into three smaller<br/>
streams.Once you cross this stream stop,and walk 33 steps down the trail<br/>
you will see some dead logs on the ground by a dead tree to your<br/>
right.Behind the longest log is the letterbox.Return the way you<br/>
came.The NeeDeeps.  <br/>
