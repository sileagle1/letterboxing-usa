Sagamore Hill National Historic Site, a NPS park located on Long <br/>
Island not too far from NYC.  The boxes were placed by the park staff <br/>
and were part of the Junior Ranger program.  When I saw a notice <br/>
about it on a bulletin board I asked the Ranger for more <br/>
information.  He said they started the letterboxing program about 1 <br/>
year ago and proceeded to hand me a kit with everything I would need <br/>
to make my own stamp and find 3 boxes.  He kidded me about becoming a <br/>
Junior Ranger, but I told him I was still just a kid at heart and <br/>
took the kit.  The clue booklet was very well written and gave a good <br/>
description of letterboxing; even referencing the LBNA website.  The <br/>
clues were designed to help kids learn more about the park (it is <br/>
Theodore Roosevelts house) and the stamps were great (professionally <br/>
made for the park).<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in all three boxes, I returned to the Visitor Center <br/>
and returned the kit, then complimented them on it.  I asked for and <br/>
received the email of that park's superintendant so I could thank <br/>
him, too.  I have since emailed him my gratitude along with a <br/>
suggestion to have his staff submit the boxes to LBNA so letterboxers <br/>
will know about them.  It would not contain the actual clues, but <br/>
could say something like "get clues at Visitor Center".  I also asked <br/>
him to forward my email to other parks to see if they would start <br/>
similar programs.  I have not heard back yet, but am hopeful.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a great compromise between the NPS and letterboxers, <br/>
and could possibly open the door for us to provide boxes to parks if <br/>
they adopt this program.  In the mean time, anyone going near this <br/>
park should check it out.  The park is free, but for a small fee you <br/>
can tour the house (well worth it).  There is also a good museum <br/>
(free) and nice picnic area.  We spent 4 hours there before catching <br/>
our flight home and really enjoyed it.<br/>
