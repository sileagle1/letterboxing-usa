for the gathering in February.  I'd been hoping that someone would <br/>
get the bright idea again.  Guess the one in Ithaca is three years <br/>
past already.  I've gotten a new friend interested, and it's renewed <br/>
my own.  She now has snowshoes, and so we'll be out in the woods <br/>
there hunting for whatever event-LBs are available.  The place is <br/>
very familiar to me, as I've XC-skied there for years.<br/>
See you next year.<br/>

O' the Trail. He is my letterboxing hero as he rescued a box of mine<br/>
recently and sent me back the tattered logbook. Speaking of which,<br/>
COT...you should watch your mail this week as I finally got a package<br/>
together for you...<br/>
<br/>
Winter boxing will be new for me, but I am psyched to try out<br/>
letterboxing via snowshoes. I have x-country skied in the past (even<br/>
own my own skis) but it just seems too much like a Nordic Track for<br/>
me...lol.<br/>
<br/>
You all will have the chance to demonstrate your stealth winter boxing<br/>
skills and I hope to pick up some pointers from you!<br/>
