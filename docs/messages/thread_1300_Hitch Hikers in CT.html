we found "Home is Where the Heart Is"  at Fuzzy Wuzzy of Puddin Lane in<br/>
Mansfield, and "Airstream" at Thimble View in Branford. Today we found<br/>
"Airstream" again!!! This time at Grist in the Mist in Mansfield (I<br/>
think thats where we were) That's 3 times we've found it! First was at<br/>
Arboretum Adventure back in July. And for the record books web masters,<br/>
we also let a Hitch Hiker loose.... The Back Packer is out there just<br/>
waiting for an adventure! Deb carved an awesome stamp, just wait till<br/>
you see it..... Good Luck everyone! Annie B (1/4 of the Elements of<br/>
Hiking) in oh what a gorgeous autumn day in Connecticut!<br/>

Management area in Scotland CT, on 10/3/02--What a great place!! The <br/>
stamps were very nice! (Great job Dan &amp; Melissa and the Drew Clan) <br/>
Both boxes were in good shape!  We got lucky and found our first <br/>
Hitch-Hiker "These Boots were made for walkin'" ( from Pennsylvania) <br/>
at the "In THe Line of Duty" Letterbox!! Will be moving that one on <br/>
to a mysterious place--Hint: One of the DREW CLAN's Boxes!! (that <br/>
oughta keep ya guessing since there are so many of them!!)<br/>
This week was also lucky!! We found our second Hitch Hiker "THE <br/>
worlds's Slowest Hitch-Hiker" on 10/8/02 at Chuck and Molly's <br/>
Letterbox called "Squirrel's Treasure"in Mansfield CT---The box was <br/>
in great shape--what a challenging tour!! It's a must do!! Beautiful <br/>
trail--we had a great time!! This Hitch-Hiker will be moving on soon--<br/>
Happy Letterboxing,<br/>
