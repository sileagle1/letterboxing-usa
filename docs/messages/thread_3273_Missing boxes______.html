<br/>
Well, okay guys - if you say so!!! I swear we were in the right place for<br/>
the first Aix sponsa  -we actually did see a depression in the ground (box<br/>
size) so thought it was gone.  Also, because the second boxes book seems to<br/>
confirm this, I thought I was safe reporting it! <br/>
<br/>
As for Fort Trumbull, found the two flat rocks with the holes in them,<br/>
where is the box?  LoneMassWolf, do you have to move big boulders to get at<br/>
it?  Darn! I hate it when I can not track it down.  ( Okay, I did have sort<br/>
of an excuse - some Navy guys came out and wanted to know what I was doing<br/>
and if I needed a bandage - really there was not THAT much blood) - so I<br/>
sort of got distracted!  I am definitely going to try BOTH again - never<br/>
surrender, never say die!<br/>
<br/>
Tom,  I guess you were right.  This was a good lesson on reporting missing<br/>
boxes and listing them - still - we did get people confirming they weren't<br/>
actually missing - so maybe this is the way to keep track?<br/>
<br/>
And for anyone, did Oma's Outlook today!  What a beautiful hike and the<br/>
vista is incredible!!  If you get the chance - please go - this one is not<br/>
to be missed.  Had a great day, went for ride after boxing and finished off<br/>
at our favorite place, the Book Barn in Niantic.  It just doesn't get any<br/>
better than today.<br/>
<br/>
Happy, tired and content in Connecticut<br/>
