Well the el dorado lady WAS there last time I found it,about two months ago,If you found the bonus it is a stamp of an/a bat! IF the box was stolen,that sucks,I will go tell the people that made the series. WELL the box is strange and dosen`t really look like a box+ the clues are hard to follow,not becuase of how they wrote them,becuase of the park map! Alright Out
