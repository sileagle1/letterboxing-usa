Dana Peak is located in Harker Heights, TX. To get to the start point <br/>
from I-35, take US 190 West and exit FM 2410 East. (There are two <br/>
exits to FM2410, take the one in Harker Heights, and not the one to <br/>
Stillhouse Park)  Continue East for 3.5 miles and turn right onto <br/>
Commanche Gap (Follow the sign to "Dana Peak").  Continue 2.5 miles, <br/>
while you pass the "Goats for Sale," and park at the bend in the road <br/>
with the gate leading to a large path. This is the start point.<br/>
<br/>
Pass the gate and walk up the hill on the large path until you come <br/>
to a large washout on the right. Follow the path at 130 degrees.  <br/>
Once the path narrows down, see the path up the hill to the right? <br/>
