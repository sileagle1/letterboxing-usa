                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>We seized upon an unexpected day off and took off for the wilds of northeastern CT! The weather was great, and the foliage nearly as good. Today turned out to be a very significant day for us as letterboxers. The last letterbox of the day filled our first logbook. :-)  
<br/>
<br/>Leave Only Footprints and Take Only Pictures: A fantastic trail, winding up and down the hills of the American Legion Forest. Anyone who thinks that government programs don't work needs to walk this trail, which was built in the thirties by the Civilian Conservation Core. Both boxes in great shape. 
<br/>
<br/>Brodie Park: Since we were here way off season, we could practically drive right up to the box. No problems here. 
<br/>
<br/>Hermit's Grave: The ranger of the Scout Reservation had no problems with us hiking on the grounds, and was most helpful with directions. :-)  The clue is a little off, but we found the Hermit's resting place. The box hadn't seen any visitors in two months, and was quite large. Too bad we didn't have a HH with us.
