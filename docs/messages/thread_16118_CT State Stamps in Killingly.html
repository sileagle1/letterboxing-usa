vandalized.<br/>
The New Hampshire state stamp box in Old Furnace state park has been <br/>
cleaned out.  The box is in place, but all the contants have been <br/>
removed.  I left a note in it and reburied it.<br/>
The Lousiana and North Carolina boxes need new ink pads.  They are <br/>
dried out and used up.<br/>
Thanks to the NeeDeeps for this nice series.<br/>
