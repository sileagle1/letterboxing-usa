<br/>
Follow Route 1 West out of Charlottetown approximately 18 km (11-12 <br/>
miles) to Stathgartney Provincial Park.  Park within sight of white <br/>
lattice arch.  This is the head of the nature trail.  This trail is <br/>
great for kids, because of its reasonable length, plus the signs <br/>
marking the various varieties of trees along the trail.  It's never <br/>
too early to introduce the young to the beauty and diversity of the <br/>
natural world.  <br/>
<br/>
Passing through the white arch, head downhill, for approximately <br/>
fifteen minutes.  You will see a small body of water on the left.  <br/>
Along this stretch is a sign noting that the surrounding vegetation <br/>
demonstrates the effects of sunlight coming through the tree cover.  <br/>
Shortly, the trail will take a sharp right turn.  Continue uphill for <br/>
a stretch of eight to ten minutes.  This is moderately heavy hiking, <br/>
so take it easy and admire the lichens on the trees.  <br/>
<br/>
When trail levels off in a grove of beech, birch, maple, and aspen <br/>
trees, with many fallen birches, look for a green-painted post on the <br/>
left.  It should have the word 'Beech' written on it.  Take your <br/>
compass bearing from this pole. Walk 45 paces (one footfall = one <br/>
pace) at a bearing of 90.  Look on the far side of a one-foot <br/>
diameter tree bearded with lichens, with moss-covered roots. Lift the <br/>
small rock to find your letterbox.  Stamp up in the logbook, and <br/>
write down the email address if you think of it.  When you get back, <br/>
please send an email to the address found within, to let me know if <br/>
you found it, what condition it was in, and how clear our directions <br/>
were. <br/>
<br/>
Continue walking down the trail in the direction you had been <br/>
traveling.  Eventually the trail will end, and you'll see the parking <br/>
lot where you parked your car.  The whole journey should take 30 <br/>
minutes or so, more if you stop to enjoy the surroundings. <br/>
