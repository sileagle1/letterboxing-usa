I wait to hear from her about where to send them.  If any to not need <br/>
to be sent somewhere right away I would like to bring them to the PA <br/>
Leap Day gather.  She mentioned something about Opra ha having <br/>
someplace to go soon.<br/>
<br/>
We thought these stamps were great and were very surprised and happy <br/>
to have them.<br/>
