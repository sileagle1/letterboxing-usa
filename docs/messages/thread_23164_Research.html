&gt; Hi all!<br/>

&gt;   One of my "obstacles" was moved, so I changed the clues a bit.  If you've <br/>

I wonder how many of the letter boxers have disabilities.  My husband<br/>
uses a power wheelchair.  Of course there are a lot of letter box<br/>
sites he would not be able to visit.  <br/>
<br/>
******************************<br/>
<br/>
Funny you should mention this.  My partner, Robb, is recovering from a<br/>
spinal cord injury, and cannot do long hikes.  But we planted a<br/>
letterbox at the Berkeley Aquatic Park yesterday.  <br/>
<br/>
I had some questions prior to Robb's injury regarding Atlas Quest's<br/>
definition of a handicap-access letterbox, and am still unclear if I<br/>
should list some of my boxes as such.  A box that may be available to<br/>
a wheelchair user may not work for a person with poor vision, for example.<br/>
<br/>
I know that there is a faction of letterboxers who aren't impressed by<br/>
drive-by letterboxing, but I have to say that once you've walked in<br/>
disabled shoes, it changes your outlook on everything.  A short walk<br/>
for a disabled person is as much of an accomplishment as a long hike<br/>
is for an able bodied person.<br/>
<br/>
Just because Robb can't manage much walking at this stage of his<br/>
recovery, why shouldn't he enjoy letterboxing?  Goodness knows, we've<br/>
got Cabin Fever and want some diversions, and to participate in some<br/>
of our normal, pre-accident activities, even if in an abreviated fashion.<br/>
<br/>
LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE DRIVE BY!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Many of my letterboxes in the SF Bay Area, and some in Central NY are<br/>
drive-by letterboxes that could be retrieved by a disabled person,<br/>
particularly if they had a friend with them to do the final step of<br/>
"scrounging around."<br/>

Gwen &amp; I have a few letterboxes that can be found and retrieved by <br/>
those in wheelchairs, but the majority can only be retrieved with <br/>
assistance. That is the dilemma of the little handicapped signs that <br/>
is in use with AQ clues. Generally when we write clues we indicate if <br/>
the trail is stroller and/or wheelchair friendly. This really is <br/>
subjective as well as one of my hunting buddies has ALS and he can <br/>
participate in some hunting situations (with help). He has one of <br/>
those super duper off road wheelchairs and we let him carry the heavy <br/>
stuff.<br/>

is a great person to take along - her memory is phenomenal and I don't<br/>

is very good at interpreting the more clever clues.  She has also<br/>
accompanied me while planting boxes.  I have a whole series called<br/>
"Laura's Childhood Luvs" that I hid with people like her in mind. <br/>
They are not necessarily wheel chair friendly but they are smooth<br/>
enough for a blind person to walk on without breaking her neck.  It is<br/>
true that she will never be able to do all of the boxes that I do but<br/>
it is a fun activity for her and she gets just as excited as I do when<br/>
we find our box.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all!<br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   One of my "obstacles" was moved, so I changed the clues a bit. <br/>
If you've <br/>
&gt; &gt; already printed them out, please destroy your copy and print again!<br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Thanks and Enjoy!<br/>

made tremendous progress over the last year.  Hiking is part of his therapy<br/>
and he loves finding letterboxes.  On a rare hike with my husband, we<br/>
figured that my son hikes about 1/2 as fast as we do.  So those drive by<br/>
boxes that can be found in 15 minutes take us about 30 minutes to reach.<br/>
Add to that the fact that I have my 23 pound infant in a backpack, and we<br/>
get very slow indeed!  : )  I really appreciate the drive by boxes because<br/>
they are about all we can handle.<br/>

I am also disabled.  I use a power wheelchair, but don't have the means to haul it around at the moment.   So we will be going to letterboxes that I can get to using my rollalator walker.  (definition: not to far)  Granted, it will take me longer to get to the box but I am game.<br/>
<br/>
My letterboxing accomplice also is limited in her ability to get around, so as soon as we can find a small trailer to haul my wheelchair and her scooter it will make a huge difference.<br/>
<br/>
The person who introduced me to letterboxing is disabled, and she has gotten a few others I know of started letterboxing who are disabled also.<br/>
<br/>
The notations on the clues stating that the trails are stroller friendly etc. are a huge help for someone in a wheelchair etc.  If someone can get a stroller through a trail, I more than likely can get my powerchair through it.   I remember reading a clue that mentioned a large tree across a trail, and wondered if there would be any way around it. LOL  We just have to look at things a bit differently when trying to get someplace. Another clue I read mentioned a creek you had to cross, so I figured I probably wouldn't be able to get my chair across that.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you don't want to give out all the information, but descriptions of things like the how easy it may be to cross that creek would let me know if it might be possible or not.  This was one thing, I was wondering if the box owners mind someone contacting them and asking a question like the above.<br/>

Not only do I think box placers wouldn't mind such a question, I think <br/>
it's imperative that you ask it!  We all box at our own risk, and <br/>
something that would be easy for my husband, is not easy for me, so <br/>
your questions should be specific to your abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to keep in mind is that trail conditions are subject to <br/>
change at any time.  I know there's a particular box I've made about 3 <br/>
attempts over a 2 year period before finding.  The first two hikes were <br/>
fine with limited problems, the third attempt was a huge difference, as <br/>
we had to bushwack our way in through portions of the trail that were <br/>
covered in debris fallen during a major storm that I had forgotten we <br/>
had.  (we got the box, btw)<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to keep in mind is that everyone needs to be constantly <br/>
monitoring the situation to make sure it's safe for their abilities.  <br/>
Even able bodied people get injured or stuck on the trail (on a ridge, <br/>
in mud, skinny dipping across overflowing creeks- you get the picture) <br/>
when they push past their 'safe limit'.<br/>
<br/>
I think box owners would be more than happy to answer your questions.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I understand that you don't want to give out all the information, but<br/>
descriptions of things like the how easy it may be to cross that creek<br/>
would let me know if it might be possible or not.  This was one thing,<br/>
I was wondering if the box owners mind someone contacting them and<br/>
asking a question like the above.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Freebyrd<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I certainly wouldn't mind if anyone contacted me, but I'd personally be<br/>
hesitant to give much of an answer because handicaps can be so individual<br/>
that what one person can do, another might find impossible, and *without*<br/>
knowing the person asking the questions and *with* knowing how litigious a<br/>
society we have, I'd have to say that I'm honestly not sure how comfortable<br/>
I'd be attempting to advise them.  Yes, there are waivers and warnings<br/>
given, but in general waivers often aren't worth nuttin' if a person wants<br/>
to sue.  A placer would still have to hire a lawyer and defend themselves<br/>
and it would be a crapshoot as to whether the waiver would ultimately hold<br/>
up in court or not.<br/>
<br/>
If a box was incredibly easy -- such as straight down a gravel walk and the<br/>
tree stump it was hidden in was right next to the trail -- well, that<br/>
wouldn't be hard to advise.  :-)  But trying to advise someone as to how<br/>
easy it might be to cross a creek?  Or even changes in grades.  Pippi &amp;<br/>
Keith placed a very easy box last year that seemed like it should have been<br/>
very handicap accessible.  Very easy gravel road for the walking.  However<br/>
there was a gradual but rather severe (for the area) change in elevation.<br/>
Being gradual, it was very deceptive.  Pippi put a warning about it in the<br/>
clues for any "out of shape" searchers, but she still received a nasty<br/>
complaint from a guy who had a heart condition.  He got to the box just fine<br/>
going downhill but then had trouble getting back to his car again going<br/>
uphill, and was none too pleased.<br/>
<br/>
So, for me, it would depend on the question(s) that the handicapped person<br/>
was asking.  But I would always reply and at least let them know if I just<br/>
wasn't comfortable answering.  Trying to judge how "easy" something is going<br/>
to be for somebody that I don't know would be difficult for me.<br/>
<br/>
And like someone else said, conditions are always changing in many of the<br/>
types of locations where boxes are planted.  I found a box yesterday that<br/>
had been planted at the very beginning of March adjacent to a wetlands area.<br/>
The tree that the box was behind was surrounded by water yesterday and I got<br/>
rather wet getting to it, which is fine with me, I'm used to walking thru<br/>
lowlands.  But when the placer first put it there, I'll bet most of that<br/>
water wasn't around.  I contacted the placer to let them know just in case<br/>
they didn't plan it that way, but haven't heard back.  Which is fine.  Just<br/>
so they know, in case they didn't when they planted it.  The previous<br/>
finders either got frustrated with the water and just tossed the box back<br/>
behind the tree and didn't bother wading in to cover the box, or rain might<br/>
have washed away the cover for the box.  But the way it was, the box was<br/>
plainly open to view.   If we have the same drought conditions we've been<br/>
having these recent years, by middle of summer the box should be in dry<br/>
territory again and it'll have no trouble remaining under cover.  :-)<br/>
That's a box that I would say would have been very handicap accessible when<br/>
it was first placed -- beautiful limestone walk almost right to the box.<br/>
Not now tho.  A motorized wheelchair might need a tow truck to get back out<br/>
right now, unless it's an amphibious motorized wheelchair.<br/>

  I'll be listing a detailed trail report with the boxes I'm preparing <br/>
for this season.  Here in Ohio we have parks that are 'hands off' and <br/>
protected and others where they cut down the trees for money.<br/>
<br/>
  Deer Creek park is part Golf course, Lodge, 'new growth' trail forest, <br/>
rented farm land and hunting lands.  They love bulldozing old fence <br/>
lines every few years and 'improving' views for the tourists by cutting <br/>
trees along the roadways,  trails get renamed for folks who are in <br/>
current favor.  With things like this going on, the areas do change <br/>
frequently.<br/>
<br/>
   Wayne National Forest is the scene of timber cutting and long-wall <br/>
mining underneath, about 400 acres are proposed for private sale to <br/>
enhance 'local school money', this is in an area where land sells for a <br/>
few hundred dollars an acre and taxes would be under $5000 per year.<br/>

   I know I certainly would not mind at all having someone contact me <br/>
and ask<br/>
about the path. My father was a paraplegic, so I understand the desire <br/>
to<br/>
get out and DO things, with slight modifications. One of my boxing <br/>
partners<br/>
has very bad knees, so she tends to plant boxes that are for those with<br/>
mobility challenges.<br/>

<snip>I wonder how many of the letter boxers have disabilities.<snip><br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I am also disabled.  I use a power wheelchair, but don't have the means <br/>
to<br/>
haul it around at the moment.   So we will be going to letterboxes that <br/>
I<br/>
can get to using my rollalator walker.  (definition: not to far)  <br/>
Granted,<br/>
it will take me longer to get to the box but I am game.<br/>
<br/>
My letterboxing accomplice also is limited in her ability to get <br/>
around, so<br/>
as soon as we can find a small trailer to haul my wheelchair and her <br/>
scooter<br/>
it will make a huge difference.<br/>
<br/>
The person who introduced me to letterboxing is disabled, and she has <br/>
gotten<br/>
a few others I know of started letterboxing who are disabled also.<br/>
<br/>
The notations on the clues stating that the trails are stroller friendly<br/>
etc. are a huge help for someone in a wheelchair etc.  If someone can <br/>
get a<br/>
stroller through a trail, I more than likely can get my powerchair <br/>
through<br/>
it.   I remember reading a clue that mentioned a large tree across a <br/>
trail,<br/>
and wondered if there would be any way around it. LOL  We just have to <br/>
look<br/>
at things a bit differently when trying to get someplace. Another clue I<br/>
read mentioned a creek you had to cross, so I figured I probably <br/>
wouldn't be<br/>
able to get my chair across that.<br/>
<br/>
