<br/>
I haven't been on the list for a while due to the lack of letterboxing <br/>
down here in Florida (apart from me). This weekend I am headed to the <br/>
mountains of North Carolina and Tennesse for a week and hope to find <br/>
and plant some boxes. I am spending on night in South Carolina and may <br/>
actually have a chance to plant the first South Carolina box. I hope to <br/>
plant a few in the mountains once I get to Tennessee. I intend to look <br/>
for the Sewanee (Tn), Highlands (NC), and Max Patch (NC) boxes during <br/>
the week. If any of these boxes are known to be missing, I would <br/>
appreciate finding out about it before I leave because each one is a <br/>
bit of a drive from where I will be staying. I will post any boxes I <br/>
plant once I return from the trip. <br/>
<br/>
Regards, <br/>
