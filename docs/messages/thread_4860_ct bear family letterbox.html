                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a note before I start. . .   I have been an avid hiker for <br/>
years.  Letterboxing is a new and wonderful world for me and I look <br/>
foward to many adventures to come.  Okay now for the business at <br/>
hand.  On Easter sunday a friend and I went to look for bear family <br/>
letterbox.  Having hiked this trail before I first noticed that there <br/>
were added bridges that were not there before and that were not <br/>
mentioned in the clues.  Not to worry though, common sense would <br/>
prevail and a stamp would await.  Long story short,  I am sure we <br/>
followed directions to the tee, and could not find box.   There were <br/>
new bridges near box location.  Was it my bad direction, or does <br/>
anyone know anything different?  None the less, it was still a <br/>
beautiful day, with a good friend and a great hike.<br/>
ps  worried that box may have been removed<br/>
