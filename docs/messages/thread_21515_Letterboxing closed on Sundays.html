So maybe librarys are not a good place because Sunday is probably the<br/>

Saturday would be my guess for the day the most letterboxes are placed<br/>

Wednesdays lead on to Thurdays. These days would be planning days with<br/>

Think that  Mondays and Tuesdays would be the slowest letterbox activity<br/>

As the old say goes..............<br/>
<br/>
Any day of the week that ends in a "y" is the best day to letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, having gone thru menopause and having been left with a bit of <br/>
"clock tipsy-turvy-itis", any day that has a 1am in it is just great for <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
And any day of the week that has a pair of crutches in it is a lousy day for <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait!<br/>
<br/>
That's what drive-bys are for!<br/>

Our library is open on Sundays, 1-5.  Don't rule them out completely.<br/>

Heck, closed on Sunday seems a minor impediment <br/>
to me! I have letterboxes hidden on land that is closed <br/>
months at a time. My Oak Island boxes in OR are <br/>
inaccessible during the winter waterfowl migration <br/>
and my new Ae'o box on Maui is in an area closed <br/>
during nesting season, behind locked gates.<br/>
There are many boxes hidden up in the Cascade <br/>
range that are under several feet of snow for much <br/>
of the year. As I see it, this is just one of the fun <br/>
challenges of letterboxing. Get 'em while you can!<br/>

Probably the only thing I miss from my days in retail is the weekdays<br/>
off to enjoy things while no one else is around.  Boxing would be<br/>
great on weekdays but not enough to entice me to work retail again. <br/>
Oh, well, retirement is only 14 years away!<br/>
