                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to the incentive of the OBX letterboxes, team BeMa traveled farther <br/>
down the Outer Banks than we had before (as a family that is, Da and Na <br/>
vacationed way down when Na was very, very pregnant with Be {so, was he <br/>
technically there?...} and stayed in a somewhat "rustic" beach home [read no <br/>
AC and mosquitoes as big as the wild horses themselves]  It took years for <br/>
Da to convince me to go back again)  Off in search of the Bodie box <br/>
(pronounced "body" -- it took me six years to learn that too.  I learned <br/>
Corolla pronounced "Ca-rawla" after a mere two)<br/>
<br/>
As I said, the Bodie site was no problem.  The only disaster was my hair <br/>
which was suffering from chronic BBHS(Bad Beach Hair Syndrome -- you know, <br/>
the salt, the sand, the lotion, the wind -- eeeewwww!) But, despite <br/>
that...the day was gorgeous and we sat on a platform overlooking the water <br/>
to sign in.  We soaked in the view and relaxed (not knowing at the time that <br/>
Sunvalleysu and company where pulling out their hair and probably <br/>
frightening the other tourists poking in all the bushes back on the marsh <br/>
trail....)  This is a great series of boxes and we look forward to getting <br/>
the other two when we get more adventurous!  We would humbly like to <br/>
recommend another be planted up in Currituck (actually pronounced just like <br/>
it's spelled -- imagine that).  This is a lighthouse that is open and you <br/>
can climb to the top.  It's a lot of fun, although it's lacking the merry <br/>
paint job of the Bodie site.<br/>
<br/>
As an added bonus -- on the way to this lighthouse -- you pass some really <br/>
good restaurants!!  Sit on the open air roof terrace at Rundown Cafe and <br/>
enjoy some great Jamaican food Man!  Pick up some fudge in Duck at <br/>
Scarborough Faire.  Walk around the shops or drive up and down admiring the <br/>
individually decorated Pegasus's that are being exhibited in honor of the <br/>
100th anniversary of flight.  Hungry again?  Pop virtually next door to Red <br/>
Sky Cafe...  You want a restaurant recommendation?!  Eating is what we do <br/>
best!!<br/>
<br/>
Shameless food plug number three plus a recap of a shining moment!<br/>
OK -- one more place ya need to go to if you are cruising 158, hungry (and <br/>
there is always room in the tummy even if you're not).  You gotta try the <br/>
frozen custard at Kill Devil.  It's just this little stand on the side of <br/>
the road (no AC and only outside benches for seating -- so lick fast!).  We <br/>
had noted their sign advertising coconut custard, but, alas, when we stopped <br/>
in, the flavor of the day was peanut butter.   Coconut had been YESTERDAY'S <br/>
flavor of the day   :-(  Not to deride peanut butter (unless you have a <br/>
fatal allergy to it, that is) but it is a far cry from coconut on a hot <br/>
sunny day.  That is when inspiration hit!  I am so very proud of myself!  <br/>
Rather than give up, slink away, accept defeat -- I had a brilliant idea and <br/>
asked if they had any hard packed coconut from yesterday that we could buy <br/>
today and pig out on for the next several days!  Lo and behold, the angels <br/>
sang, the clouds (back in VA where they are permanently residing) parted and <br/>
the young woman behind the counter produced a quart of coconut all ready to <br/>
go!  It just doesn't get any better than that!  So, forget the meager scoop <br/>
-- we had Coconut frozen custard several times a day until we finished it <br/>
off the morning we headed back home.  Plus, having hid the whole transaction <br/>
from the kids -- we hardly even had to share any!!!  Makes me weep with <br/>
happiness just remembering.<br/>
<br/>
One small note of remorse, (not the not sharing of the custard part -- we're <br/>
the parents, we have to have some fun to ourselves since the kids discovered <br/>
the two headed showers and insisted on coming in with us every time) while <br/>
on the marsh trail at Bodie -- we lost the cap to our special letterboxing <br/>
pen.  I guess we should be very glad that it was just the cap and not the <br/>
entire Miss Ma who loved to lean waaaaaay over the reeds and grasses in <br/>
search of all the little critters below...  What a vacation!<br/>
