I would appreciate it if posters could intentionally change the <br/>
subject line to something completed unrelated to the contents of the <br/>
post.  That way I can think I'll be reading about some pleasurable <br/>
Disney worthy jaunt your family made into the jungle and instead I <br/>
will find myself gleefully reading yet another off-topic rant full <br/>
of misplaced anger and he-said, she-saids.<br/>
<br/>
That would really make my day, especially since I can't find my <br/>
rubber chicken nor my Martian popping thing.<br/>
