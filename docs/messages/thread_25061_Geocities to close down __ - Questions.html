I agree it would be a shame to loose clues from inactive boxers on geocities the way we did on aol-hometown last year. Let me talk with Choi about this: it would be easy for him to list the clues currently on geocities. Maybe we could mount a national campaign to contact placers and/or adopt and repost clues onto letterboxing.org.<br/>
