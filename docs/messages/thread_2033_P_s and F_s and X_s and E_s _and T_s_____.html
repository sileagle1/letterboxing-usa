understand this concept, some people may be carrying a stamp, BESIDES their <br/>

person...E would be a category of it's own. People with high E <br/>

I'm not modest. I rather doubt anyone would want to forge it though.)<br/>

<br/>
I like your clear message about X, E and T<br/>
<br/>
You were being sincere and sensible..I have to hold up my hand and admit<br/>
to a certain "Tinkerishness" in my mailing about other codes like B for<br/>
Buildings and P for Pubs and so on !... (though I do indeed keep such<br/>
counts) <br/>
<br/>
Mmmm (thinks) ..It takes some effort to collect all the pubs on Dartmoor !<br/>
..but that's also a tinkersih thing to say <grin> So back to being<br/>
sensible ...<br/>
<br/>
For most UK boxers the logic is about  "e" for effort !  ..<br/>
<br/>
The 100 club admits folk to its ranks (?) if letterboxers have collected,<br/>
unaided, 100 box stamp images "from the moor"...<br/>
<br/>
....In order to get that hallowed 100 Club Patch...you have to have made<br/>
some effort...<br/>
<br/>
So ONLY boxes found on the moors ...with "e" for effort are counted in<br/>
that 100...<br/>
<br/>
It may be worth saying that our patches are colour coded...so are, in<br/>
effect, F count patches as well as club patches...<br/>
<br/>
( In reality UK boxers only ever discuss their "F" count .. we don't<br/>
really consider anything else as important )<br/>
<br/>
Any other counts ..."B"uildings .."P"ubs..."E"vents ( "M" Meet ) and even<br/>
e"X"changes  (which I guess are the same as our "T"ravellers) ..DON'T<br/>
COUNT for qualifying to get your membership nor for that big round sought<br/>
after patch ! <br/>
<br/>
The idea that a "Traveller" ( a stamp that travels with the letterboxer)<br/>
should also be unique and not the same as your "personal" is just our<br/>
way...I agree with Der Mad Stamper about that ...mostly, because well I<br/>
started that way...and yes it would seem odd to me to use my "personal<br/>
stamp" in someone elses collectors book ..just a different idea that's<br/>
all... .. oh and it gets a nice extra set of different stamps too !<br/>
<br/>
We have a separate catalogue of Travellers and folk like to collect them<br/>
fer sure ! but they aren't 100 club material !<br/>
<br/>
Many boxes still hold to the rule that the Travellers are only exchanged<br/>
(one for one) on the moor !.. so some "e" for effort occurs for them<br/>
too...but it is becoming more common to exchange em at general meets too !<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that Xchanging personals is about the same then isn't it ?<br/>
<br/>
Many boxers make their Traveller different each year !... but there is no<br/>
rule about that either !<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about the rules of letterboxing is that .. well that there<br/>
aren't any ! <grin><br/>
<br/>
Those other rules about protecting the outdoor environment are always the<br/>
same, whether we are hiking, letterboxing or just plain having a picnic...<br/>
<br/>
Wait !! ..Stop right there !  Now I think of it...don't we need a "PN"<br/>
count too, for boxes found whilst having a Picnic ?<br/>
