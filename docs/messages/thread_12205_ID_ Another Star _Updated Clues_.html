"Another Star" Letterbox <br/>
<br/>
Created by franzsolo (placed with the help of A-bear) on 20 April <br/>
2003 <br/>
Star, ID <br/>
Ada County <br/>
<br/>
Directions: Off of Highway 44 at the Star MERC head south on Main St <br/>
to the southern most point where you can park on the dirt near some <br/>
large boulders. You will be able to see a rope swing (it's not always <br/>
there, but there's really only one area where you can park) and a <br/>
bridge from the parking spots.<br/>
<br/>
Description: Easy walking, but can be muddy.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Start at the three large water turnkeys by the river.  From <br/>
the southern most key walk 60 paces (pace=2 steps) at 240 degrees <br/>
basically following the dirt road west along the river.  Before the <br/>
pile of rocks you will see on your left a path headed down towards <br/>
the river between 2 wild trees.  Take the path down until you meet <br/>
the "B/Dill" tree on your right.  On its southwest side behind a <br/>
removable porous rock awaits ANOTHER STAR. <br/>
<br/>
I had to re-hide this letterbox as its previous location is under <br/>
constant construction and I was afraid it would be moved with the <br/>
rocks.  <br/>
