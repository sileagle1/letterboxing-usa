&gt; "LOVE THE HILLS"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hidden August 13, 2002 by "Dave P" in Tallahassee, Florida (Leon County).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been geocaching since March 2001 and hid the first geocache in this<br/>
&gt; area (go to www.geocaching.com for more information).  I decided to give<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing a try and found my first one in Atlanta, Georgia this past<br/>
&gt; weekend with my wife, Ellen (I learned how to use a compass while on the<br/>
&gt; hunt).  I have been planning to hide this one for a while and found a good<br/>
&gt; spot for it.  With the tree cover, it would be hard to find a geocache, so<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; letterbox works real well here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I named this Letterbox for the local terrain and my 'mantra' while riding<br/>
&gt; mountain and road bikes in the area.  If you don't love the hills, they<br/>
will<br/>
&gt; defeat you.  This search will take you on a short up-hill hike (less than<br/>
&gt; one-mile round-trip).  The letterbox is a sandwich sized, plastic<br/>
container.<br/>
&gt; It contains a handmade stamp (my first one), an inkpad, a logbook, and a<br/>
pen.<br/>
&gt;  Please e-mail me at david1959@juno.com to let me know of your find.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The letterbox is hidden in San Luis Park on San Luis Road at San Pedro<br/>
Ave.<br/>
&gt; My siblings and I played in these woods with our friends while growing up<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; nearby San Luis Ridge in the early to mid 1970s, long before the park was<br/>
&gt; here.  There is no charge to enter the park.  The trails are well defined<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; sandy and crossed by lots of tree roots.  Stick to the trails until the<br/>
final<br/>
&gt; direction.  Wear comfortable walking shoes and bring insect repellant.<br/>
&gt; Beware of poison ivy and local wildlife.  There is a water fountain and<br/>
&gt; bathroom in the park but you may want to bring a water bottle for the<br/>
hike.<br/>
&gt; Don't forget your compass and your stamp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Start off at the tic-tac-toe game at the playground.  Take a bearing of 10<br/>
&gt; degrees and walk 85 paces.  I am a 5'9" tall male taking normal sized<br/>
steps.<br/>
&gt; A pace is counted on a footfall of either foot, i.e. two paces are counted<br/>
&gt; each time the right foot hits the ground.  You will have to cross several<br/>
&gt; obstacles here.  You will see a light pole.  From the light pole, take a<br/>
&gt; bearing of 30 degrees.  Follow the path uphill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  You will come to a pine tree in the middle of a fork in the path.  From<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; tree, head 0 degrees north, following the trail until you come to a bench.<br/>
&gt; You may take a short break here.  From the bench, take a bearing of 320<br/>
&gt; degrees and follow the path until you get to a "T" in the trail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the "T", take a bearing of 280 degrees and follow the trail to a second<br/>
&gt; bench.    Don't take a break now, you are almost at your goal.  From the<br/>
&gt; middle of the three-way intersect in front of the bench, take a bearing of<br/>
&gt; 340 degrees and walk 50 paces, sticking to the trail.  Turn to a bearing<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; 100 degrees and take 8 paces off the trail.  Be careful of the flora and<br/>
&gt; fauna here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The letterbox is at the base of the tree, covered with large, dark stones<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; leaves.  After leaving your stamp's imprint and any message you may want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; write, and stamping your book with my "Love The Hills" stamp, please seal<br/>
&gt; everything back up and replace the letterbox just as you found it.  Cover<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; up well so that it won't be found by accident.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope you had fun.  Please e-mail me at david1959@juno.com to let me know<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; your find.<br/>
