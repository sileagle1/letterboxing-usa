mostly because I'm tired of receiving email regarding this subject. <br/>
This fact remains above all else, if people want to create hybrid boxes <br/>
that is their business , they purchase the materials, do all the work <br/>
on it and maintain the boxes. If you don't want to be a part of it, <br/>
then don't. It's that simple. Can we please stop with the drama on this <br/>
subject and remember this is all for fun!! Promote positvity, be happy <br/>
that you can at least get out and enjoy life.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mary, it certainly is within the possibility that someone can create a <br/>
hybrid, there are many out there and I don't see that as being the <br/>
thrust of the discussion or a problem.<br/>
<br/>
I think, in the best of my ability to understand it, that many <br/>
geocachers don't like the hybrids being listed on the geocache site- <br/>
thus the idea to start another letterboxing website by Jeremy.<br/>
<br/>
Since there already are a bunch of sites- Letterboxing.org and <br/>
Atlasquest to name two- why do we need another letterboxing site, and, <br/>
in particular, one by someone whose main focus is something different <br/>
(geocaching)?<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't the more logical thing be to create a lettercaching or a <br/>
geoboxing site? :o)<br/>
