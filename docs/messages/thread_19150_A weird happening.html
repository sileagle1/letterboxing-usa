You've heard us lament over the loss of "A Major Award HH"?<br/>
Well, they found the logbook at "Celebrations" down in Mouse World in Florida!<br/>
Unfortunately the stamp was not there. Also, it seems the log book for "Celebrations" was not there. They thought perhaps it was geocachers, I do not concur Dr. Watson.<br/>
I've been boxing with multi boxers and HH's and keeping all the stamps and logbooks and ink pads straight can be confusing. I beleive that somewhere out there is the Major Award stamp and the Celebrations logbook hitchhiking around the US. A bit like Nomad and Veeger, huh? (Star Trek fan alert)<br/>
So, that's my theory.<br/>
By the way, we have asked that the logbook be returned to us and I think that Dave is going to carve a replacement stamp - we'll start it off again.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I salute the Nomad reference Dr. Roykirk, but I must say am appalled at the Veeger reference. That movie almost doomed the franchise 1st time out of the gate! Thankfully it rebounded with the fabulous # 2 WoK and was cemented as classic with the best movie ever, #6 TUC. Okay, I will take off my uniform now and put away my tricorder and resume my human disguise.<br/>
