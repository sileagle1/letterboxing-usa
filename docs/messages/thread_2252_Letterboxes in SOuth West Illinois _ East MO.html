 HI.<br/>
 There has been a lot of Letterboxing activity in this area and the St. Louis <br/>
area in MO.  We have a few teachers who are going to be introducing this <br/>
activity to their classes and there will be about 25 kids at an orienteering <br/>
class on May 8 who will be trying Letterboxing out for the first time.   <br/>
<br/>
 If possible it would be great to have the Illinois page updated.  I would <br/>
really appreciate it.  I know that all of you web masters have lives outside <br/>
of LbNA so no pressure ... well, not much anyway.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so Much,<br/>
Mohmers<br/>

 The Catsup bottle has been poached ... to be replaced soon.<br/>
 Across the Board has been removed due to store closing but will be relocated.<br/>

<br/>
GARDEN of the GODS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            The Garden of the Gods Recreation Area is located in southern <br/>
Illinois in the Shawnee National Forest.  For map details see: <br/>
http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/shawnee/indexmap.htm.   Click on 'topo map' for <br/>
overall view of national forest and road routes; click on 'east side of <br/>
forest' for location of Garden of Gods Recreation Area.<br/>
<br/>
            Located within this recreation area - maintained and open year <br/>
round - are the Pharaoh Picnic Ground, the quarter-mile, interpretive <br/>
Observation Trail, and the Pharaoh Campground consisting of 12 campsites, <br/>
tables, fire grills, toilets, and an extensive trail system.  For further <br/>
information see http://www.gorp.com/dow/eastern/shninfo.htm and/or <br/>

<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
  1.. After turning into the Garden of the Gods Recreation Area, a designated <br/>
parking lot for backpackers will be seen at 0.9 mile.   Park here.<br/>
  2.. Return to park access road and turn left.<br/>
  3.. Enjoy the marvelous rock formations on your right as you walk the <br/>
approximately 0.2 mile to the River- to-River Trailhead.<br/>
  4.. When you reach the River- to-River Trailhead, go west on the trail.<br/>
  5.. Proceed approximately 160 paces, passing a trail back to the <br/>
backpackers' parking lot on the left, until you come upon a long, 5 to 6 foot <br/>
high stone escarpment on your right.<br/>
  6.. A bearing of 310 degrees should align you with the largest tree on the <br/>
escarpment.<br/>
7.  15 paces to the escarpment will bring you to what you seek hidden in the <br/>
wall near this tree.<br/>
<br/>

*   Nick Bantock's Griffin and Sabine Trilogy (see: <br/>
http://www.griffinandsabine.com/), being a particular favorite of 'Cock o' <br/>
The Trail' and 'St. George,' has led to this joint venture of placing a <br/>
letterbox.  Enamored with personal correspondence between lovers, and <br/>
especially titillated by Bantock's exotic &amp; voyeuristic correspondence <br/>
between Griffin and Sabine,  'Cock o' The Trail' &amp; 'St. George' have <br/>
temporarily assumed the modern-day identities created by Nick Bantock.  Each <br/>
carved stamp in this series will represent the face of a postcard sent by us, <br/>
with love, to letterboxers the world over.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is the first (#1) placed by Griffin and Sabine.<br/>

I am going to tackle the IL update, but after reading your 25 April <br/>
post and seeing the extentive list I need some help.<br/>
<br/>
We have been placing all new LBs in a table by county. It would <br/>
really help if you could match a box name on the posting with the <br/>
county they reside in. It looks like a few are not yours. Maybe you <br/>
could pass this onto the others and get their counties.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
