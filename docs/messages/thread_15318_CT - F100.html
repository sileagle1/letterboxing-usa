great time myself, bubbatroysondae and metoui's chicken had <br/>
yesterday going to 7 of CT's DEP Forests, all totalled we have 21 <br/>
of the 30 stamps in the forests, (by the way, congrats to wanda <br/>
and pete on getting all 30 of them) we did:<br/>
<br/>
Naugatuck S.F.<br/>
Paugussett S.F.(This one was my F100) :)<br/>
Pootatuck S.F.<br/>
Wyantenock S.F.<br/>
Housatonic S.F.<br/>
Mohawk S.F.<br/>
Nassahegon S.F.<br/>
<br/>
We also found the Cunningham Tower Box in Mohawk S.F.(nice <br/>
spot to hide a "box" and our last stamp of the day was a <br/>
piggy-back box in Nassahegon S.F., thanks to Superstick and <br/>
Wilderness Woman for this one, we only missed you by 10 hrs. <br/>
It was a long day of driving and walking, but the weather was <br/>
perfect for it so we decided to try and do as many as we could <br/>
while we were out. We already have requested the patches the <br/>
DEP is giving for 5 of the forest boxes, now we are only 9 away <br/>
from getting their walking stick, we can't wait.<br/>
All of the boxes we found today were in good shape and not to <br/>
difficult to find, we only had a little trouble figuring out the <br/>
difference between compass bearing and azimuth, but we did it  <br/>
and found the box after a little searching.<br/>
All in all it was a great day with the weather, driving through the <br/>
western part of the state, walking through the state forests to <br/>
letterbox and my F100 plus the piggy-back box we found.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
