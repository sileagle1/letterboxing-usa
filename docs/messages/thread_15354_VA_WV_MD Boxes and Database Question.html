Dancing Bears at Bear Island and <br/>
Guardian of Big Schloss boxes, and <br/>
olf Gap box (Placed by Crawdaddy).<br/>
<br/>
I even posted a SitRep on the Adventures of Superboxer trio that I<br/>
found in Scranton last weekend.<br/>
<br/>
There are now only 56 entries to the database, and mine isn't there<br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know what the deal is?  <br/>
Is it going away?<br/>
Why is it people don't like it?<br/>
<br/>
AND - anyone gone to Big Schloss, Dancing Bears or Wolf Gap yet?<br/>

deleting the entries?  I know that with email I can see the full<br/>
header which shows the actual person and originating IP address, even<br/>
if efforts have been made to disguise it (spam for instance).  With<br/>
Eudora, at the top of the message is a box that says "BLAH BLAH BLAH"<br/>
and I just click it and it shows everything. Since this is email<br/>
based, do you think a record of the Database activities exists?<br/>
