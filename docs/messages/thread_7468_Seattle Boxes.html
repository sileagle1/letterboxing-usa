Vancouver, BC. So actually any box near I-5 in Washington (north of <br/>
Longview) is a possibility but any near where we were going anyway <br/>
would have been a bonus. I've managed to figure out where some of <br/>
the Seattle parks are so I think we'll be able to look for some. <br/>
Maybe we'll take a "generic" box in case we happen upon a good spot.<br/>

Thanks to all that responded here or via email.<br/>

&gt; &gt;We will be travelling through Seattle and will propbably do the<br/>

Can<br/>

&gt; Wooo!  You had me all kinds of excited there for a few seconds.  I <br/>
was two <br/>
&gt; seconds from springing from the chair while the clues printed, <br/>
hopping the <br/>
&gt; bike and going to find the downtown boxes! LOL!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as I know, there aren't any actually located in the <br/>
touristy areas, <br/>
&gt; though that would be a REALLY fun series, and I keep thinking it's <br/>
one that <br/>
&gt; I should do when i get a chance.  Depending on when you'll be <br/>
here, there <br/>
&gt; should be an Eastlake series (a few minutes from downtown, on Lake <br/>
Union), <br/>
&gt; and there are quite a few parks that are between 10 and 15 minutes <br/>
from the <br/>
&gt; Needle/Market type areas that have boxes.  (Ravenna, Carkeek, Me <br/>
Kwa Mooks, <br/>
&gt; Schmitz, Discovery, Camp Long...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And if you give us dates, maybe the Seattle Contingent of the IALC <br/>
can come <br/>
&gt; up with SOMETHING downtown....<br/>

some 'boxing while I am there.  Could someone please let me know of <br/>
some easy boxes that are in the city area? I will be staying close to <br/>
