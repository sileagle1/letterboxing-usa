<br/>
Yeah, I know that, but my point was that if a newspaper like the<br/>
Boston Globe is going to print an article about letterboxing, I think<br/>
it's unlikely there's much that we can do to prevent it. Freedom of<br/>
the press and all that. Which, allegedly, is supposed to be a good<br/>
thing. =)<br/>
<br/>
But take all those people who read the Boston Globe and suddenly find<br/>
themselves addicted to letterboxing. Some of them will likely turn out<br/>
to be master letterboxers--the next Legerdemaine, if you will.  Some,<br/>
well, let's not dwell on that. =)<br/>
<br/>
At this point, though, letterboxing is way out of the bag. Even<br/>
without press, people are hearing about through rubber stamp clubs, or<br/>
through scrapbooking clubs, or through geocaching, or through friends,<br/>
or from a friend of a friend, or just by picking up a book in the<br/>
bookstore.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like every time a letterboxing article makes it into a major<br/>
publication, the same issues are rehashed over and over again. It gets<br/>
old after a while. And after all is said and done, a few boxes end up<br/>
missing, many more are planted, and the same people who first learned<br/>
about letterboxing through a newspaper pound the table and want it to<br/>
stop. Nobody likes change and everyone wants to stop it, but you know,<br/>
that's not going to happen. The Boston Globe wasn't the first major<br/>
publication to write about letterboxing and it won't be the last. When<br/>
it happens again--not if, but when--I'd hope a couple of brave souls<br/>
around here step up onto the plate and make sure it's an article we<br/>
can accept.<br/>
<br/>
I bet geocachers are wishing they had a bit more say in how geocaching<br/>
was covered on Law and Order: Criminal Intent. Burying caches.<br/>
*rolling eyes*  Phrases like "burying letterboxes" or "digging up<br/>
boxes" might start popping up if we don't guide the press which would<br/>
be a far bigger disservice to the hobby than saying nothing to them.<br/>
It could have been a lot worse, and for the fact that it wasn't, I'm<br/>
grateful.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; -- Ryan<br/>
<br/>
While this education certainly might be a way to mitigate the effects <br/>
of too much publicity, I believe in the long run the mitigation will <br/>
not have much benificial significance. Education of the new and <br/>
curious will only take on those that probably don't need the <br/>
encouragement to be responsible.  The more that publicity occurs,then <br/>
the more increase of any negative impact. There is no real method that <br/>
can be used to eliminate press, but I for one will not encourage nor <br/>
assist in any publicity. Long before we were contacted for the Time <br/>
Magazine article we came to the conclusion that the nature of <br/>
letterboxing will be continuously changed every day. Look how the game <br/>
has changed just in the last year to two years. The game will continue <br/>
to evolve and like it or not there is very little that one can do to <br/>
direct it's course. At the same time I see no reason to hasten it's <br/>
change by cooperating with reporters. The only concern reporters have <br/>
is to sell their story and entertain their readers. Writing a story <br/>
that will help letterboxing or that will educate their reader is <br/>
pretty far down the list. A "No interview" position should be up to <br/>
each individual and this decision should be made by each person and <br/>
not by any group.<br/>
Ryan is right about "catching a waterfall",but  I would just like it <br/>
to slow a bit.<br/>

&gt; it's unlikely there's much that we can do to prevent it. Freedom of<br/>
&gt; the press and all that. Which, allegedly, is supposed to be a good<br/>
&gt; thing. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But take all those people who read the Boston Globe and suddenly <br/>
find<br/>
&gt; themselves addicted to letterboxing. Some of them will likely turn <br/>
out<br/>
&gt; to be master letterboxers--the next Legerdemaine, if you will.  <br/>
Some,<br/>
&gt; well, let's not dwell on that. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At this point, though, letterboxing is way out of the bag. Even<br/>
&gt; without press, people are hearing about through rubber stamp clubs, <br/>
or<br/>
&gt; through scrapbooking clubs, or through geocaching, or through <br/>
friends,<br/>
&gt; or from a friend of a friend, or just by picking up a book in the<br/>
&gt; bookstore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems like every time a letterboxing article makes it into a <br/>
major<br/>
&gt; publication, the same issues are rehashed over and over again. It <br/>
gets<br/>
&gt; old after a while. And after all is said and done, a few boxes end <br/>
up<br/>
&gt; missing, many more are planted, and the same people who first <br/>
learned<br/>
&gt; about letterboxing through a newspaper pound the table and want it <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; stop. Nobody likes change and everyone wants to stop it, but you <br/>
know,<br/>
&gt; that's not going to happen. The Boston Globe wasn't the first major<br/>
&gt; publication to write about letterboxing and it won't be the last. <br/>
When<br/>
&gt; it happens again--not if, but when--I'd hope a couple of brave souls<br/>
&gt; around here step up onto the plate and make sure it's an article we<br/>
&gt; can accept.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I bet geocachers are wishing they had a bit more say in how <br/>
geocaching<br/>
&gt; was covered on Law and Order: Criminal Intent. Burying caches.<br/>
&gt; *rolling eyes*  Phrases like "burying letterboxes" or "digging up<br/>
&gt; boxes" might start popping up if we don't guide the press which <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; be a far bigger disservice to the hobby than saying nothing to them.<br/>
&gt; It could have been a lot worse, and for the fact that it wasn't, I'm<br/>
&gt; grateful.<br/>

Tell me about it!!  You would think that people would<br/>
catch on and eliminate the need for the discussion,<br/>
but apparently that isn't working.  If it needs to be<br/>
rehashed from time to time, then so be it.  I could<br/>
see it getting old if there was an article about<br/>
letterboxing every month, but there isn't. (at least<br/>
around New England.) <br/>
<br/>
Hand carved vs. Store bought is getting old.  PZ KUT<br/>
vs. Pink stuff is getting old. Stamp mounting<br/>
discussions are getting old.  Telling people how to<br/>
re-hide properly is getting old.  This issue, however,<br/>
I don't think is getting old.  I think it may be a<br/>
call for change.  <br/>
<br/>
You may be annoyed by the frequency of this<br/>
discussion, but it's going to happen when an article<br/>
like this comes out.  I mean after all, it's not<br/>
discussed THAT often is it?  <br/>
<br/>
If the issue was concerning any of the above worn out<br/>
topics, then we would be in agreement.  But, I don't<br/>
think this one is worn out yet.  Maybe after a few<br/>
more publications I'll see it your way.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I pretty much felt the same way as Seth for the first <br/>
couple of years that I was boxing. My lips were sealed <br/>
(as were most boxers') when the media came poking <br/>
around, especially with those from New England. I <br/>
finally gave in when I was approached by a reporter <br/>
from Omaha. I contacted the one active boxer in the <br/>
area and asked his opinion. He couldn't wait to get <br/>
some press in the hopes that it might encourage some <br/>
other players. In fact there are now THREE active boxers <br/>
there, not exactly a glut.<br/>
<br/>
When several of us were contacted by TIME last spring, <br/>
there was worried discussion about the national exposure<br/>
and we decided that the article was going to be done<br/>
whether we participated or not. Not a one of us wanted<br/>
more press for the hobby or ourselves but we decided <br/>
to cooperate. It was our hope that the stealth aspects of <br/>
the hobby would be properly presented and act as some <br/>
sort of damage control.<br/>
<br/>
After that article came out, I pretty much gave up on the<br/>
hope that the game would remain underground. It will never<br/>
again have the delicious sneaky feeling that it once had. Now<br/>
when I see yet another article on letterboxing, I sigh, roll my <br/>
eyes and continue to play on the sneaky level with the <br/>
like-minded friends I've developed over the years. <br/>
<br/>
Some discussions may be repetitive but you have to keep  <br/>
in mind that there are newbies joining up every day. The<br/>
archives for this list have become so unwieldy that I don't<br/>
really expect the initiates to read them as I did when I first<br/>
started boxing. They are asking the same old, same old on a <br/>
regular basis, not to be annoying but just because they want<br/>
to learn the same stuff we wanted to learn at the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
I do wish that more new folks would take the time to read the <br/>
FAQs before asking questions; I do wish more would join the  <br/>
New Boxers' List; AND I do wish that there were fewer repetitive <br/>
threads but I can't see that any of those is likely to happen<br/>
so I'm unwilling to waste time being annoyed. It's a game, after <br/>
all, isn't it?<br/>

Hi Seth,<br/>
<br/>
In this particular case, the article would have been published with <br/>
or without input from the letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
The Boston Globe correspondent heard about it through either his or <br/>
his editor's wife who works at a library who knows about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
The correspondent posted a request for input on the LBNE Board.  I <br/>
called him the first second I read the post.  Why?  To seize the <br/>
opportunity to a) talk him out of writing the article in the first <br/>
place or b) at least attempt to control what *would* be published in <br/>
the article.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning a):<br/>
<br/>
I spent close to an hour on the phone with the correspondent trying <br/>
to convince him to NOT publish an article at all.  For all of our <br/>
various and sundry reasons.  I've been letterboxing since 2000, and I <br/>
*know* what publicity does to us.  You are preaching to the choir.  I <br/>
told the correspondent flat out that the very LAST thing in the world <br/>
that a letterboxer wants to see is a print article about <br/>
letterboxing.  I told him about the damage the Time Magazine article <br/>
did to the community, how hundreds of clues to boxes were removed <br/>
from LbNA as a result.  I appealed to him that he cannot control the <br/>
readership of his paper.  It could be read by someone who would be <br/>
truly interested and respectful of the hobby - and it could also be <br/>
read by a bunch of bored teenagers who might think that finding and <br/>
destroying letterboxes was more fun than smashing mailboxes with <br/>
baseball bats.  I even invoked the threat to national security, The <br/>
Patriot Act, Homeland Defense, et al, because it could be read by a <br/>
terrorist group who could use letterboxing as a means to plant bombs <br/>
at key military and political locations.  (I really did.  Honest.  <br/>
Ask him.)  It didn't matter.  The editor had a bee in his bonnet and <br/>
by golly, that article was going to be published.  Period.  Which <br/>
brings us to -<br/>
<br/>
Concerning b):<br/>
<br/>
I hammered home the reason why letterboxing is what letterboxing is <br/>
reflects the very nature of the hobby - obscurity, secrecy, <br/>
discretion, respect for others and for the environment.  If he was <br/>
going to write an article, write it with respect.  That correspondent <br/>
got the lecture of his *life* from me about respect.  And I think the <br/>
article reflects that.<br/>
<br/>
Given his assignment, he had to publish an article.  With or without <br/>
our help.  The response he got from us would be reflected in the <br/>
article.  If we had said *nothing*, he very well might have published <br/>
a completely erroneous article, which helps no one and could only <br/>
hurt us.  If we had responded with hostility, he very well may have <br/>
dug deep into the subject via the 'net all by himself, *and* with an <br/>
attitude that *we* gave him, and could have published a whole *lot* <br/>
more stuff than he did, blowing all attempts at discretion aside.<br/>
<br/>
I chose to respond with caution, intelligence, and respect.  Respect <br/>
for this hobby and respect for every single solitary letterboxer and <br/>
every single solitary letterbox on the planet.  Am I glad that the <br/>
article was published?  No.  Can I look myself in the eye in the <br/>
mirror and say "I did what I could to protect that which I love?".  <br/>
Yes.  And I stand by my words.<br/>
<br/>
He listened to me, and to others.  He did his homework.  We, as <br/>
Americans, have the right to free speech.  The article was going to <br/>
be written and published whether we liked it or not.  At least we got <br/>
an intelligent and respectful article.  A win/win situation to a <br/>
situation we wish we didn't have to have.<br/>

happened, my feeling about the publicity has changed. <br/>
As you had seen from my response to your post.  Sorry<br/>

&gt; &gt; Tell me about it!!  You would think that people<br/>

&gt; discussion,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but apparently that isn't working.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (takes a deep breath)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Seth,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In this particular case, the article would have been<br/>
&gt; published with <br/>
&gt; or without input from the letterboxing community.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Boston Globe correspondent heard about it<br/>
&gt; through either his or <br/>
&gt; his editor's wife who works at a library who knows<br/>
&gt; about letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The correspondent posted a request for input on the<br/>
&gt; LBNE Board.  I <br/>
&gt; called him the first second I read the post.  Why? <br/>
&gt; To seize the <br/>
&gt; opportunity to a) talk him out of writing the<br/>
&gt; article in the first <br/>
&gt; place or b) at least attempt to control what *would*<br/>
&gt; be published in <br/>
&gt; the article.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Concerning a):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I spent close to an hour on the phone with the<br/>
&gt; correspondent trying <br/>
&gt; to convince him to NOT publish an article at all. <br/>
&gt; For all of our <br/>
&gt; various and sundry reasons.  I've been letterboxing<br/>
&gt; since 2000, and I <br/>
&gt; *know* what publicity does to us.  You are preaching<br/>
&gt; to the choir.  I <br/>
&gt; told the correspondent flat out that the very LAST<br/>
&gt; thing in the world <br/>
&gt; that a letterboxer wants to see is a print article<br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  I told him about the damage the Time<br/>
&gt; Magazine article <br/>
&gt; did to the community, how hundreds of clues to boxes<br/>
&gt; were removed <br/>
&gt; from LbNA as a result.  I appealed to him that he<br/>
&gt; cannot control the <br/>
&gt; readership of his paper.  It could be read by<br/>
&gt; someone who would be <br/>
&gt; truly interested and respectful of the hobby - and<br/>
&gt; it could also be <br/>
&gt; read by a bunch of bored teenagers who might think<br/>
&gt; that finding and <br/>
&gt; destroying letterboxes was more fun than smashing<br/>
&gt; mailboxes with <br/>
&gt; baseball bats.  I even invoked the threat to<br/>
&gt; national security, The <br/>
&gt; Patriot Act, Homeland Defense, et al, because it<br/>
&gt; could be read by a <br/>
&gt; terrorist group who could use letterboxing as a<br/>
&gt; means to plant bombs <br/>
&gt; at key military and political locations.  (I really<br/>
&gt; did.  Honest.  <br/>
&gt; Ask him.)  It didn't matter.  The editor had a bee<br/>
&gt; in his bonnet and <br/>
&gt; by golly, that article was going to be published. <br/>
&gt; Period.  Which <br/>
&gt; brings us to -<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Concerning b):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hammered home the reason why letterboxing is what<br/>
&gt; letterboxing is <br/>
&gt; reflects the very nature of the hobby - obscurity,<br/>
&gt; secrecy, <br/>
&gt; discretion, respect for others and for the<br/>
&gt; environment.  If he was <br/>
&gt; going to write an article, write it with respect. <br/>
&gt; That correspondent <br/>
&gt; got the lecture of his *life* from me about respect.<br/>
&gt;  And I think the <br/>
&gt; article reflects that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Given his assignment, he had to publish an article. <br/>
&gt; With or without <br/>
&gt; our help.  The response he got from us would be<br/>
&gt; reflected in the <br/>
&gt; article.  If we had said *nothing*, he very well<br/>
&gt; might have published <br/>
&gt; a completely erroneous article, which helps no one<br/>
&gt; and could only <br/>
&gt; hurt us.  If we had responded with hostility, he<br/>
&gt; very well may have <br/>
&gt; dug deep into the subject via the 'net all by<br/>
&gt; himself, *and* with an <br/>
&gt; attitude that *we* gave him, and could have<br/>
&gt; published a whole *lot* <br/>
&gt; more stuff than he did, blowing all attempts at<br/>
&gt; discretion aside.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I chose to respond with caution, intelligence, and<br/>
&gt; respect.  Respect <br/>
&gt; for this hobby and respect for every single solitary<br/>
&gt; letterboxer and <br/>
&gt; every single solitary letterbox on the planet.  Am I<br/>
&gt; glad that the <br/>
&gt; article was published?  No.  Can I look myself in<br/>
&gt; the eye in the <br/>
&gt; mirror and say "I did what I could to protect that<br/>
&gt; which I love?".  <br/>
&gt; Yes.  And I stand by my words.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He listened to me, and to others.  He did his<br/>
&gt; homework.  We, as <br/>
&gt; Americans, have the right to free speech.  The<br/>
&gt; article was going to <br/>
&gt; be written and published whether we liked it or not.<br/>
&gt;  At least we got <br/>
&gt; an intelligent and respectful article.  A win/win<br/>
&gt; situation to a <br/>
&gt; situation we wish we didn't have to have.<br/>

Why not have a *Join Membership* mandatory to LBNA web site? It might <br/>
weed out the more nefarious types (chances are that they would like to <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a newbie I find this whole chain pretty humorous. Do you think in '89 the <br/>
folks of Dartmoor were thinking, "Damn yanks are going to ruin it." Dartmoor <br/>
has been around for 100+ years, gotten much more publicity, and still <br/>
manages to thrive. Why would LBNA be any different?<br/>
 I've seen a lot talk on these boards about "community". Communities need to <br/>
remain open, and open to change, in order to thrive. If they don't, they <br/>
become cliques. Until someone lines up a corporate sponsorship for their <br/>
boxing addiction, or ESPN creates a crazy 1/2 hour "Box-Off" to replace the <br/>
World's Strongest Man competitions, a little publicity can't hurt. <br/>
 Rather than fret, accept that newbies are a fact of life, and be thankful <br/>
for those who that take the time to answer for the 1000th time, "What's PZ <br/>
Kut?" These people put countless hours into helping newbies get off on the <br/>
right foot--letterboxing.org <http: foot--letterboxing.org="">, altasquest, <br/>
the newboxers group, etc. Every time I ignore the "dire SC legislation" post <br/>
without reading it, I thank the patient people who steer the boat.<br/>
 If a handfull people a year learn the joy of letterboxing--exploring their <br/>
surroundings, stewardship the environment, creative expression--a few pesky <br/>
posts and the occasional trail dolt is worth it. Besides, finding your own <br/>
box, or the same box for the 3rd or 4th time isnt' much fun unless it's in a <br/>
cemetary, archelogical, or historical site. : )<br/>

&gt; &gt; 2004. How many articles have you seen about<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing. Moreover, how can it be gettig old to<br/>
&gt; &gt; you? How many publications have there been since<br/>
&gt; &gt; November of 2004 and which ones annoyed YOU the most?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Curious, <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Why not have a *Join Membership* mandatory to LBNA web site? It might <br/>
&gt; weed out the more nefarious types (chances are that they would like to <br/>
&gt; remain anonymous).That way the clue pages will only be accessible to <br/>
&gt; those who ~need a clue~.<br/>
<br/>
Just as an FYI, Atlas Quest already has something similar to that<br/>
where people can choose to have their clue available only premium<br/>
members. You don't even have to be a premium member to list a box as<br/>
being for premium members only, and one can be fairly confident only<br/>
"serious" letterboxers will be able to see the clue.  It still won't<br/>
protect boxes from poorly replaced letterboxes, but it does help weed<br/>
out teenage hooligans looking for a box to vandelize or a newbie<br/>
letterboxer that might not stay with the hobby for very long.<br/>
<br/>
So not only does somemone have to sign up, they'd have to pay for the<br/>
privelege of getting access to your clues. =)<br/>
<br/>
But by default, all clues are accissible to everyone and only a tiny,<br/>
tiny number of people have listed such "restricted boxes".<br/>
Consequently, I suspect it's not as popular of an idea as one might think.<br/>
