<br/>
Yesterday I had a wonderful time letterboxing with<br/>
Butterfly and Lobstah Lady. Three boxes and a<br/>
hitchhiker found by Lobstah Lady. A great day all<br/>
around. Effusive and public thanks for including me!<br/>
<br/>
I related a story to them about a too-close call with<br/>
a Timber Rattlesnake at Timberlin Park here in<br/>
Connecticut. They thought it was a good idea to share<br/>
with the LBNA group, particularly those of us who go<br/>
into areas where there might be any kind of poisonous<br/>
plant or animal. While we enjoy the hunt, we must also<br/>
be conscious of our own personal safety at the same<br/>
time. The encounter my partner and I had was a<br/>
chilling reminder of this.<br/>
<br/>
The clues to the letterbox we were looking pointed us<br/>
to an downed tree whose dirt encrusted roots were<br/>
above ground. It was moving toward dusk on a dead calm<br/>
night when we observed such a tree. My friend picked<br/>
up a stick perhaps 18" in length and began probing<br/>
into the shadows of the exposed root structure. I was<br/>
standing behind him. <br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, we both saw something moving to our<br/>
right about two feet away. Since it was such a calm<br/>
night, any movement at all caught our immediate<br/>
attention. The movement came from a coiled and<br/>
ready-to-strike juvenile Timber Rattlesnake. Very<br/>
slowly, we backed away and left the area. <br/>
<br/>
We learned later that juvenile rattlers do not begin<br/>
to get their rattles until after they shed their skin.<br/>
One rattle is added each time they shed we were told. <br/>
We were also told that even this 18"-24" long snake<br/>
can be aggressive and strike quickly with nearly as<br/>
much venom as an adult.If anyone knows differently,<br/>
please share with the group. Our understanding is that<br/>
Timber Rattlesnakes are endangered here in Connecticut<br/>
and rarely seen ,but, as we found out first hand, it<br/>
only takes experiencing one who might have decided to<br/>
aggressively protect its turf for us to make changes<br/>
in the way we behave on the trail. <br/>
<br/>
We do not want to be alarmists here, but we learned a<br/>
good lesson about being much more observant of our<br/>
surroundings and the places we look for and place<br/>
letterboxes. Now, my partner and I carry trekking<br/>
poles (any long stick will do nicely) when we are<br/>
letterboxing. If we find a box concealed in a tree<br/>
root or other area where the box might be shared with<br/>
any wildlife species that has every right to be there,<br/>
we are now much more careful about the manner in which<br/>
we remove the box. Nor does it hurt to purchase or<br/>
assemble a simple first aid kit and carry it with you.<br/>
I guess it goes without saying, some knowledge of<br/>
first aid and "what to do if..." is a good idea as<br/>
well. <br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share this "interesting" experience.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Linda, you are very lucky to have observed such a rare creature! How <br/>
very exciting. Oh, I'm not belittling the danger of such an encounter, <br/>
but everything turned out ok because you handled yourself so well. We <br/>
don't have very many poisonous beasties in CT, but this serves as a <br/>
reminder that while they may be rare, caution and preparedness is <br/>
always a good thing. <br/>
