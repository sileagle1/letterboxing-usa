                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have just created two stamps from photographs using Photoshop as a <br/>
tool. An example is posted in the files section (Gracestamp3.jpg). <br/>
The other stamp became the stamp for the Looking for Molly HH. You <br/>
will have to find it or a box it has visited to see how it turned <br/>
out (it's pretty cool!).<br/>
<br/>
Those interested in how I did this can go to a webpage I just <br/>
created which has instructions and hints. I hope that others find <br/>
this technique useful.<br/>
