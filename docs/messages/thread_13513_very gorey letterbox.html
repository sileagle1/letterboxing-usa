                    <div class="plaintext-content">I saw your comments on the talklist and wanted to let you know that <br/>
someone has found your gorey box. We were at it last friday and all <br/>
was well except that a great poison ivy crop is springing up between <br/>
the path and the tree. That's a neat area, another one of those we'd <br/>
never have seen if it weren't for this obsession. We were actually <br/>
there last fall with some friends to find Funhog's letterbox a bit <br/>
farther out on the path. We also did the cedar swamp Wizard of the <br/>
Waves box which had been visited by 7 or 8 people I think. We were <br/>
glad to see that you had put it there because that trail, an annual <br/>
stop for us, has been needing a box and may even need another one <br/>
deeper in the woods. We had looked for the one under the old platform <br/>
just before it was rebuilt but couldn't find it. As old Roy used to <br/>
say, Happy Trails!      Mr. Coon  <br/>
