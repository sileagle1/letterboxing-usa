Walked along and saw a great dike, cement flood gate was in his site <br/>
uh-huh.<br/>
<br/>

Froggy walked to a 4way cross, turned right on blue dot then uh-huh<br/>
Turned right twice saw blue dot on post uh-huh<br/>
white pine on left and down the slope uh-huh<br/>
<br/>
DEP posted No Vehicle sign uh-huh<br/>
Mount Hope moved here in 99 uh-huh<br/>
crossed steel trusses to the white pine uh-huh<br/>
Froggy turned left now the pine stands behind moving on the trail now <br/>
uh-huh<br/>
<br/>
Froggy took the trail as it went left uh-huh<br/>
Climbed up through the pretty white pine uh-huh<br/>
Followed path through Hemlocks now river far below him now uh-huh<br/>
<br/>
Froggy went apast an old meadow   now uh-huh<br/>
Weeds a growin now no mowin now uh-huh<br/>
Trail turns left at an old cedar tree and through a ironwood you will <br/>
see uh-huh<br/>
<br/>

Big around as a pumpkin he said uh-huh<br/>
 then the trail came to cross a path  he stopped uh-huh<br/>
We're close to the spot now see if we can think it out now  uh-huh<br/>
<br/>
Froggy thought the hill ahead went straight to heaven he said uh-huh<br/>
When no ones comin climb that hill uh-huh <br/>
look for a stump big as can be uh-huh<br/>
What you seek is hiding there, stamp it quiet, replace it there uh-huh<br/>
