                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi:<br/>
<br/>
     I have been contacted by Brad Drazen of WVIT NBC 30, who would <br/>
like to do a 2 to 3 minute segment in a special he will be airing <br/>
locally in several weeks. His special is "Where in CT is Brad Drazen" <br/>
which spotlights scenic areas and hobbies in CT.<br/>
<br/>
     He would like to go boxing with Sue and I and other interested <br/>
letterboxers. He has promised to honor the secrecy of where boxes are <br/>
planted and will not even air the location or park or trail where the <br/>
boxes are - only the town.<br/>
<br/>
     Before I agreed to something like this, I wondered what the <br/>
group felt about publicity. I would think that if the secrecy of the <br/>
box locations is kept, it could only bring more interest people into <br/>
this hobby of ours. Recently, there have been many newspaper stories <br/>
about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
     Please post your opinions as I am unsure of what to do.<br/>
<br/>
     Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That sounds great to me.  In fact, I wish I could get publicity<br/>
like that down here in Texas since we have so few letterboxers.<br/>
It's hard to believe Connecticut needs more letterboxers!<br/>
