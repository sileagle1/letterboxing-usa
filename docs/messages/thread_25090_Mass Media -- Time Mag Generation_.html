boxes.  I've placed maybe 5.  I've been to one gathering, and while the<br/>

box alone, or with my husband.  I don't rate my success by my PFX count -- I<br/>
rate it by the fact that I've explored southeastern Wisconsin, Las Vegas,<br/>

other people's boxes as my tour guides.<br/>
<br/>
And I have repaired, re-bagged, and re-hidden everything I've ever found,<br/>

some of these boxes, not everyone can say that.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, we'll get another influx of n00bs, families, kids, more boxes will<br/>
go missing, lame boxes will show up, something that annoys everyone will<br/>
eventually show up, but you know, maybe 5 years down the line we'll have<br/>
whittled the influx down to another core generation that loves this game.<br/>

I saw the broadcast on NBC, and was irritated that it was descibed as looking for "treasures". That is all they really said. Nothing about stamping or the history. I know we treasure the hunt, the hand carved stamps, and reading the entries in the logbooks, but is the average American family on a budget this year because their rec budget is cut going to "treasure" this past-time, or get disappointed by what they find? <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Kermit, for sharing your story AND the article from 5 years ago.  I too found letterboxing through a magazine (or two):  I think there were just brief mentions in FAMILY FUN and a publication by FOCUS ON THE FAMILY.  We've sure had a lot of fun in the ensuing 20 months or so, since we finally stopped researching and started venturing out.<br/>
