Redcrest, California<br/>
P;aced November 13, 2002 by Doublesaj and Old Blue<br/>
Rated: Easy--a very short, level walk from your car.<br/>
<br/>
Before a recent trip to the Northern Coast of California, Old Blue and I logged on to the trusty Letterbox listings in anticipation of finding several new ones to add to our growing stamp books. Alas, nary a single clue did we find for this part of the state even though it is one of the most scenic and little-traveled areas in beautiful Northern California!<br/>
<br/>
Daunted not, we set fourth to place the first letterbox along the "Avenue of the Giants" in the old growth redwoods of Northern California 37 miles south of Eureka, California.<br/>
<br/>
Driving and walking through towering redwoods is an unearthly experience. All noise is buffered by a solemn drip, drip, drip of ferns, moss and overhanging spans of some of the oldest trees on the planet. The soft crunch of needles and fungus underfoot and the dampness of the air makes one aware of the abundant life at the base of these amazing giants. Certainly, this is the land where fairies and elves dwell. If you listen long enough, make no sudden moves and are pure of heart, you will certainly begin to see these beautiful, fellow-earthlings.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Coming from the South on coast highway 101, exit at the Holmes / Redcrest turnoff. Turn toward Redcrest entering the enchanted land of the giant redwoods. Heading west, you will pass the "Immortal Tree" which has withstood the loggers ax and floods as well as lightning strikes for hundreds of years. Proceed just 0.2 miles more and park off the road on the right, across from the sign for the Abraham Haas Grove.<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the blackened hollow of an ancient redwood tree. From the hollow, proceed due north 23 paces to his cousin, a good 3 meters in diameter. Turn due west and go 50 bear-sized paces. As you do so, look right between 2 trees and you'll spy a fallen log spanning the creek. The Redcrest Fairyland Letterbox is located at the South end of this log, under a wide, moss-covered, natural plank.<br/>
<br/>
And please, refrain from taking small, winged "souvenirs" from the area.</body></html>
