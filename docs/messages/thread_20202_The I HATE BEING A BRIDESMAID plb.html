                    <div class="plaintext-content">On October 15, I am going to embark on my fourth trip down the aisle.<br/>
As a bridesmaid. By this time next year, I will have done it six<br/>
times. And every time I do it, I think, "This is the LAST time!"<br/>
<br/>
I mean it. Number six is the last time. Three times a bridesmaid,<br/>
never a bride. Six times... I'm SOL as it is. I don't need to go<br/>
for seven.<br/>
<br/>
I have burgundy, navy, lavendar, hunter green, periwinkle and some<br/>
shade of red called "clarion." With shoes and purses (and gloves, in<br/>
one case) to match.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, every time I lay down my cash, the bride says the SAME THING.<br/>
"You can wear it again!" I think I wore one again, once, as a<br/>
Halloween costume.<br/>
<br/>
So let's have it. You can sign up for this PLB, slated to be mailed<br/>
out around the time of my fourth trip down the aisle, in mid October,<br/>
if you've ever had to buy something to wear in a wedding that "you can<br/>
wear again!"<br/>
<br/>
Email me at davyschris@aol.com.  I'm thinking 20 people or so? Let's<br/>
see what happens. :)<br/>
<br/>
In this box, I want to know whose wedding it was and what color it<br/>
was. And if you ever did wear it again!<br/>
