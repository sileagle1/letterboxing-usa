<div align="center"><span class="370393200-07102002">Go to Booth &amp; Dimmock Library on Rte 31 in 
Coventry, CT. It is a large brick building. From the intersection on 275 &amp; 
31 turn left. It is just passed the large Congregational Church. The church is 
on the Right and the library is on the LEFT. Pull to the rear of the parking lot 
and park.</span></div>

<div align="center"><span class="370393200-07102002">Mary Lemist Titcomb, was a true library pioneer! After 
working as a library organizer in Vermont for twelve years she arrived in 
Washington County, Maryland (the second working library in the United States) in 
1902. She was enthusiastic and full of ideas. She felt loaning free books 
was just a small part of a libraries duties. With in 5 years of her arrival 
to Washington County the library had 66 deposit stations. Books could 
even be ordered from the main library to the deposit stations. Mary 
became concerned that books were not getting to isolated people who did 
not have the luxury of having a library in their area. If they could 
not come to the library than the library should go to them. By 1904 
the book wagon became a reality making Washington County the first 
library in the world to carry books to homes! The driver covered a 500 mile 
territory. The area's second book mobile was built in 1912 and had an 
engine!  </span></div>

<div align="center"><span class="370393200-07102002">Find the light post closest to the back of the 
parking lot. Keeping your back to the light post, facing the back woods, take a 
reading of 0 degrees. Walk to the stonewall just inside the wood line. At the 
break in the wall, on the left hand side, reach DEEP under the  stone and 
find your treasure.  You may want to stamp in your car.</span></div>
