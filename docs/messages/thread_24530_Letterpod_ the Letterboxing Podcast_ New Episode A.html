about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
A podcast is like a radio show for your computer.  You don't need an<br/>
IPOD to listen to it, you can listen to it right on your computer. <br/>
You can download it to an iPod as will to listen, but that's optional.<br/>
<br/>
Choi started the Letterpod last year, but because of personal reasons<br/>
wasn't about to continue to do it.  So I've taken over the job and<br/>
hope to get lots more participation from YOU with future episodes.<br/>
<br/>
In the newest episode we have a segment we hope will be an ongoing one<br/>
from Orion, called "Tales from the Trails".  I also conducted a phone<br/>
interview with wassamata_u.  I think its a fun episode, and have lots<br/>
of ideas of ways to make it better for the next.<br/>
<br/>
We can't do it without YOU though, so listen and tell us what you think.  <br/>
