Tuesday I think will be a month since I  tried to post my new <br/>
letterboxes in Hamden Ct at Brooksvale park. With this great weather I <br/>
know some people would love to letterbox in that area as there are few <br/>
to search out there.<br/>
Any help ??  Nancy aka Butterfly.<br/>

Sorry, Nancy! Last night I got all caught up with the boxes I <br/>
overlooked in mid-March, but my computer was fritzing and I couldn't <br/>
upload/FTP to the site. I'll try again tonight. There were quite a <br/>
few of them, by the way...<br/>
<br/>
This is an example of why it's great to post your clues here, as <br/>
everyone can see them and go a-lookin' without waiting for so-called <br/>
webmasters to do their thing.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to go find them myself!<br/>
