the few, the brave, the adventurous!<br/>
<br/>
Visit the Prince of Power letterbox placed by Two Gray Squirrels in <br/>
Pocomoke State Forest--it's not a difficult find at all.  You will <br/>
find that only three have stamped in before you.  You will also find <br/>
a surprise inside, a surprise that is aching to be helped upon it's <br/>
way. (is that a big enough hint?)<br/>
<br/>
While in the area travel over to Assateague Island to see if you can <br/>
find Barefoot placed by Jolly G-man--*no one* has ever found that box-<br/>
-wouldn't it be cool to be the first?!?  Also check out the Dunes box <br/>
placed by The Usual Suspects...how many have that stamp in their <br/>
collection??  <br/>
<br/>
So- end your summer with a bang and with 3 (or more) stamps very few <br/>
have inside their books.  The ponies are especially nice, too!<br/>
<br/>
Any takers??<br/>
