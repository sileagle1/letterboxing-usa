urged my husband and 16 year old (rolling their eyes all the way) to join me <br/>

got me, an indoor type, OUTdoors, my hubby (Old Blue) was hooked. In fact, <br/>
his clues and carvings are better than mine now! This is part of what makes a <br/>

Got one of those myself.  There is a maximum box per day limit that she reaches when we are on vacation.  She doesn't mind if it is a wham-bam find but if it takes any time to find at all, well....<br/>
<br/>
She tolerates my hobbies but doesn't necessarily relish them.<br/>

  My husband's not nearly as excited as I am about letterboxing, but he likes <br/>
  hiking in the woods, and I keep telling him, if we're going to hike in the <br/>
  woods, we might as well be hiking on a trail with a letterbox as not!   Also, he <br/>
  likes that he's the one who can often find a box after I've given up.   I keep <br/>
  telling him he HAS to come with me just for that reason.<br/>
<br/>
  Of course, when we saw bears for the very first time, and it happened on a <br/>
  trail we'd never have taken if there hadn't been a letterbox there, that was a <br/>
  good selling point, too!<br/>

&gt;       It's not the bears that freak me out. Those dang hungry <br/>
cougars <br/>
&gt;   you'll have in Calif. have a way of making me think "Is this box <br/>
