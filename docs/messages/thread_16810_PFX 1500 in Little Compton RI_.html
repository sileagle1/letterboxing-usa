on Sunday.  <br/>
<br/>
We started out at Mothball Fleet by Jay Drew... which was one of the first <br/>
things to make my day!  I got to see AIRCRAFT CARRIERS!!!!!  Thanks Moonstone <br/>
for showing them to me!  GO NAVY!  (can you tell that I wanted to be an F-14 <br/>
Pilot when I grew up????  Too bad I was too short!)  BTW... just to let you know, <br/>
the box has now been pulled for retirement.  Thanks Jay for a great box!<br/>
<br/>
Then we headed out to Little Compton to find boxes there!  During our outing, <br/>
I found my PFX 1500 box!  Woo Hoo!  And what made it super special, was that <br/>
the box was at my other favorite pastime!  (For those who know me well.... you <br/>
KNOW where that was..... sip sip sip..... :-) <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Laurette and Moonstone Baby for making my day!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

D'oh!  I've been waiting very impatiently for the opportunity to get<br/>
that box.  Lucky you, you got the last stamp.  And congrats on the<br/>
milestone -- that's huge.<br/>
