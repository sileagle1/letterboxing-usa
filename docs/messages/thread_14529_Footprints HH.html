Hi Kathy,<br/>
<br/>
You'll be pleased to know that this HH was first placed at Naked <br/>
Woman at the Waterfall, Scituate, RI, on July 26, 2003, where I found <br/>
it yesterday.  I will be moving it along somewhere (at one of my <br/>
boxes) in Eastern Massachusetts (probably sometime later today).<br/>
<br/>
I checked Pete and Wanda's HH tracking page, and this hitchhiker <br/>
wasn't on it.  If you want it tracked, you may wish to contact Pete <br/>
and Wanda to put it on their tracker list.<br/>

Granted, my darling, granted.  But after many many boxing outings <br/>
with you, where you are just driving along and say "Gee, I think <br/>
there's a letterbox around here someplace", pull over, jump over a <br/>
guardrail, and retrieve a letterbox - ALL WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OR <br/>
WITHOUT ANY CLUES - it was a very BIG treat for me (and yes, I did <br/>
let out a girly squeal) to actually come across a HH in your presence.<br/>

So neener, neener, but yes, you are right :-)<br/>

I sometimes read clues or even print them, and forget all about them, until something, like a graveyard, reminds me that I left something cooking on the back burner, and I operate by intuition and subliminal memory.  In other words, all those great finds have a lot to do with smoke, and luck.  :-)  <br/>

&gt; <blush>  Well, I'd admit, that when I'm on, I'm *ON*.  But no prior knowledge? Hardly.  I sometimes read clues or even print them, and forget all about them, until something, like a graveyard, reminds me that I left something cooking on the back burner, and I operate by intuition and subliminal memory.  In other words, all those great finds have a lot to do with smoke, and luck.  :-)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, there is a fun box on your way back to your home-away-from-home.  It's called RI Directions or something.  It's a mystery you can solve as you are driving.<br/>

&gt; Love you, stick-totin' Warrior Woman!<br/>

&gt;   Granted, my darling, granted.  But after many many boxing outings <br/>
&gt;   with you, where you are just driving along and say "Gee, I think <br/>
&gt;   there's a letterbox around here someplace", pull over, jump over a <br/>
&gt;   guardrail, and retrieve a letterbox - ALL WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OR <br/>
&gt;   WITHOUT ANY CLUES - it was a very BIG treat for me (and yes, I did <br/>
&gt;   let out a girly squeal) to actually come across a HH in your presence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So neener, neener, but yes, you are right :-)<br/>
