I appreciate the webmasters concerns about liability for abandoned <br/>
boxes.  If I were them, I wouldn't want to receive a bunch of <br/>
undeserved hostile emails either.  But I am concerned that some of <br/>
these loyal letterboxers have not claimed their boxes because they <br/>
are unable to do so.  I know of one or two 'boxers who have webtv and <br/>
are unable (for reasons that I don't understand) to post to the new <br/>
website.  Any thoughts on how to fix this problem webmasters???<br/>
