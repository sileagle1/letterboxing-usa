Patriotic Pug Letterbox<br/>
Dana Peak Park<br/>
Harker Heights, TX<br/>
Bell County<br/>
Placed: January 1, 2003<br/>
Placed by: The Pug Lovers<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy (but Long)<br/>
Time: 1 hour<br/>
<br/>
Dana Peak Park is located in Harker Heights, TX. To get to the start point<br/>
from I-35, take US 190 West and exit FM 2410 East. (There are two exits to<br/>
FM 2410, take the one in Harker Heights, and not the one to Stillhouse Park)<br/>
Continue East for 3.5 miles and turn right onto Commanche Gap (Follow the<br/>
sign to "Dana Peak").  Continue 2.5 miles, while you pass the "Goats for<br/>
Sale," and park at the bend in the road with the gate leading to a large<br/>
path. This is the start point.<br/>
Pass the gate and walk up the hill and then down the hill towards Stillhouse<br/>
Hollow Lake.  You will pass a trail crossing, continue straight at 80<br/>
degrees, towards the hills across the water.  When you are walking on<br/>
lake-level, you will come to a dead end with a choice to go left or right.<br/>
Go left (Follow the trail at 10 degrees).  The next trail marker you see<br/>
will have a faint painting of a "Turtle T-2" on it, follow it straight.<br/>
This will lead you around the water.  At the next trail marker, go straight.<br/>
You will then come to a "Turtle T-2" trail marker, follow path to the left.<br/>
Continue following this past straight until you reach the lake's edge.<br/>
Along your journey you will pass a bike repair box as a path comes in from<br/>
the right---continue straight and do not take this path to the right.  Once<br/>
you reach the lake's edge, admire the view, take a dip (weather permitting)<br/>
and let your dog get a drink.  Then, turn around and stand with your back<br/>
towards the lake.  At a direction of 220 degrees go 20 paces (1 footfall = 1<br/>
pace) to a dead tree.  From that tree, at a direction of 310 degrees, go 55<br/>
paces.  You will come upon a large dead branch marking the intersection of<br/>
two paths (the one you came in on and one veering off to the left, if you<br/>
are facing the lake).  You will find the Patriotic Pug Letterbox under rocks<br/>
at the base of the dead branch.  Thanks for visiting the Patriotic Pug<br/>
Letterbox:)<br/>
