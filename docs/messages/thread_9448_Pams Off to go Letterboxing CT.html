drove by the parking area around 1:00 PM to see if your car was <br/>
there. I drove by after work at 4:10 PM. If it was there at that time <br/>
I would have gone up to check on you. Your friends Chuck, Molly and <br/>

&gt; Well.... since I am a school teacher, and hate to go to the mall on <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Friday after Thanksgiving, I'm going to go letterboxing today!  I'm <br/>
hoping to <br/>
&gt; find the My Favorite Musicals series in Mansfield, plus a couple of <br/>
others <br/>
&gt; before I have to come home and work on my presentation for Monday.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is my first time letterboxing in snow.... I'm guessing that it <br/>
makes it <br/>
&gt; all the more difficult.  So wish me luck!  BTW..... I'm going <br/>
alone, so if <br/>
&gt; there are any letterboxers that haven't done the musicals yet, make <br/>
sure you <br/>
&gt; see me check into each box ok???<br/>
