                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found the Jones Point microbox by Mindizney.  The high water had <br/>
washed quite a bit of flotsam and jetsam up on the shore.  The zip <br/>
lock back was lying exposed, with no sticks or anything covering it, <br/>
but surrounded by stuff like an old shoe and detergent bottles.  Like <br/>
some of the comments in the log said, "it was hard to distinguish the <br/>
microbox from the trash".  Several people had stamped in, the last <br/>
being April 21st.  <br/>
<br/>
A beautiful little stamp.  Fabulous for such a small size.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly she meant for you to sit by the side of the river and enjoy <br/>
the view while stamping in.  My 90 year old Mom and Dad and I did <br/>
just that.<br/>
<br/>
But it is a little too close to the river for comfort.  The water was <br/>
just 2 feet away.  I took the liberty of moving it across the path <br/>
out of the way of the raging waters.  If you prefer I would be glad <br/>
to move it back.  Here is what should be added to the clues, though <br/>
you probably want to rewrite it:<br/>
<br/>
"Once you find the double tree stump take a bearing from it of 275 <br/>
degrees.  You will see a large vine covered tree and next to it a <br/>
tall metal post.  What you seek is behind the metal post under a log <br/>
covered with ivy.  You are encouraged to cross back to the stump and <br/>
sit on the edge of the river to enjoy the view while stamping in."<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
