Lyme Disease was picked up at "Fishing Woes".  We were out checking <br/>
boxes and came upon it. Today we were out in Royalton to do some <br/>
boxes from the gathering. We picked up all of our boxes. Then had <br/>
time to catach a few of the others. When we were leaving we ran into <br/>
the Sprite and Swift Falcon. Sprite caught Lyme Disease. Last we <br/>
heard it was off to parts unknown.<br/>
