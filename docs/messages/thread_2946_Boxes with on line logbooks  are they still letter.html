 &lt;&lt; (I personally would<br/>
  not count things that do not have a stamp and a logbook for your<br/>
  stamp -- they are not letterboxes, IMHO). &gt;&gt;<br/>

 HI!   The micro boxes that we planted at the zoo do have stamps and a note <br/>
identifying them as letterboxes and explaining how to log into the log book <br/>
... it is just that the location we chose required very small "boxes"  so 4 <br/>
of them have on-line log-ins sites only and one had a very small log book.<br/>
<br/>
 We intended them to be letterboxes from the beginning.  <br/>
 ... so Please tell me it aint so.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
 This was my kids' idea.  They picked out the stamps, the names and the <br/>
locations (I helped with the clues) and they would be very disappointed to <br/>
think they hadn't actually planted bonifide letterboxes to count toward their <br/>
P numbers.  :o)<br/>

 Happy Hunting,<br/>
