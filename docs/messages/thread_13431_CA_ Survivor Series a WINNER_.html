The preserve was wonderful to drive to, with the best views in the Bay Area. <br/>
Likewise on the trail! We were surprised at how many people were out on the <br/>

people and 15 dogs in the 1 1/2 hours it took us to enjoy the easy hunt for <br/>

those of you who CAN survive without "Survivor".<br/>

Thanks Princess Lea for a great afternoon!<br/>

I have to say that I also am a die hard Survivor fan and wish I was <br/>
closer to CA. However, I think that VA is a little far to travel to <br/>
find that series. Great idea!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm so glad you enjoyed the Survivor series (both TV and letterbox versions).  Am glad to hear all 4 boxes are still "surviving."  I keep thinking I need to add a Jenna stamp to the series since she was the winner, only I didn't like her very much (I was rooting for Christy or Alex).  I also want to do a Survivor: Africa series as Lex is my all time favorite contestant.  Can't decide if I should plant it in Vallejo (near Marine World/Africa USA) or down in Santa Cruz where Lex lives.  So many ideas, so little carving time....<br/>

We assumed you didn't add stamps to the "Survivor" series as you intended <br/>
because Jenna was the winner. I haven't heard a single person who felt she was <br/>
worthy of the win let alone worthy of all but 1 vote! How did that happen! Will <br/>
look forward to another Survivor series when you get the time.<br/>
