I was wondering if anyone could tell me where Bear's Angel Hitch Hiker is<br/>
now traveling about?<br/>
The Hitch Hiker orginiated in Solvange California and was last reported to<br/>
be dropped somewhere North of that.<br/>
Any information would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
This Hitch Hiker was trying to make it's way to Portland Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a ton!<br/>

You don't mention in your post what date Bear's Angel HH was reported <br/>
in Solvang, but I'm sure it was after I had it.  I dropped it off in <br/>
Carlsbad on 6/7/03.  Please let me know if you want more details.<br/>
