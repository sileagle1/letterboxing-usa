Not sure if this changes anything in the clues for you. Regardless of <br/>
the math, we were still able to locate the box with little difficulty.<br/>

Thanks for a neat adventure to a gorgeous spot!<br/>

As of last night, the Critters of Ennisbrook Series clues are now <br/>
posted to the new sight.  Which is a good and great thing, because <br/>
that series is one of the best things going in Central Coast <br/>
Letterboxing.         -Jugglermouse<br/>

Hi Ron!<br/>
<br/>
I bugged the new site enough so they put the Critters up there now. <br/>
Thank you for showing us what a great series can be. Also, I love <br/>
your Salmon Creek Falls, even though I got poison oak kissed there.<br/>
<br/>
Please, head down to the San Luis Obispo area soon and check out some <br/>
of ours.<br/>
<br/>
Fraternally,<br/>
Balthazar<br/>
<br/>
