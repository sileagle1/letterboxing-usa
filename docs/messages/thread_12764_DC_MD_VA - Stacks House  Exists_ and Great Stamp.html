stamp is Fabulous.  <br/>
<br/>
Attempt number 4.  It's an event night in the area and parking is at <br/>
a premium.  Maybe we should have taken the Metro since it's so close, <br/>
but our parking karma was with us and we lucked out as someone pulled <br/>
out right in front of us.  <br/>
<br/>
The place was crowded and fun last night.  Night Owl and I <br/>
immediately guessed the red head must be ___.  It took a while to get <br/>
her attention but she knew what we were talking about.<br/>
<br/>
There it was.  It really exists.  Nice logbook.  And we were first!  <br/>
Had any of you stamped into the original misplaced box?  We thought <br/>
it was a commercial stamp, it looked so intricate, before we took it <br/>
out of the ziplock. We liked the stamp so much we decided it just had <br/>
to have green ink so we donated a green marker, rubberbanded to the <br/>
box, to keep with it.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I'm giving much away to say that it's local, it's fun, <br/>
it's yummy and it's great to go for on a rainy weekend.  And I <br/>
recommend the shephards pie.  <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Celtic Pride for the nice work on the stamp and for <br/>
replacing it.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards we were "fortified" to continue into the night ... and <br/>
dark.  See next post.  Letterboxing in the DARK.<br/>
