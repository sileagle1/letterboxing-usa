the outside of my bag. Only once have I ever felt it might be needed <br/>
in my multitude of loner hikes and had plenty of time to assess the <br/>
situation and prepare. I refuse to let fear rule my world but am also <br/>
certainly not foolhardy.  The peace that letterboxing hikes provide <br/>
for me is precious beyond measure. <br/>
