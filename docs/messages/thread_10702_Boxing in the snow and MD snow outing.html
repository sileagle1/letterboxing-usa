                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was boxing in the snow the last couple of days and yes, I was <br/>
nervous about leaving tracks.  Before I left the area I tracked in <br/>
other directions leaving a bunch of confusing tracks.  <br/>
<br/>
It sure is harder to find something under 6 inches of snow!  Searched <br/>
and searched, which isn't very good, all that tramping around.  I'm <br/>
even more worried about re-hiding the boxes.  Can't really see how <br/>
the sticks and leaves will work after the snow melts.  I'll choose <br/>
snow boxes carefully.  <br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed Bernie the Tree Frog and Sherlock.  D and Shoo, if they <br/>
over nearby, might want to check Lilies of the Valley before the snow <br/>
completely melts to be sure it is still hidden alright.<br/>
<br/>
Celtic Pride, I really enjoyed Sherlock.  Great theme and a terrific <br/>
stamp.  I can't wait to  bring the wife and dog back to do the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>

letterboxers "off the track". Carry some yellow food coloring with <br/>
you. If anyone follows the track, they would figure whoever left the <br/>
tracks was just answering the call of nature. LOL <br/>
