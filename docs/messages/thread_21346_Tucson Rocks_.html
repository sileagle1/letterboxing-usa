It was a momentous day in the sunny Southwest. Tucson <br/>
had its very first official letterbox gathering today! Seven <br/>
letterboxers met for an incredible breakfast at one of the <br/>
city's landmark restaurants. AZRoadie and his wife brought<br/>
their wonderful scrapbook made to commemorate their <br/>
letterboxing extravaganza last summer in the Northwest. <br/>
<br/>
It turned out that two letterboxes had been placed to honor<br/>
the event. The funny part is that coincidentally, they <br/>
were both placed at the same amazing landmark, a <br/>
fantastic pedestrian overpass in the shape of a diamondback<br/>
rattler. Five of us trooped on over and snagged the great <br/>
stamps, one by AZRoadie and the other by Kristal and Ron. <br/>
Jodi and Bruce told of their out of state letterbox hides, <br/>
whetting everyone's appetite for future placements here in <br/>
Arizona.<br/>
<br/>
I am soooo pleased that I was able to be in town and meet<br/>
these intrepid pioneers of Arizona letterboxing. The letter-<br/>
boxing action is just taking off here and I'm sure the number <br/>
of boxes in this lightly covered area will blossom and grow. <br/>
I'm already looking forward to my annual trip here in 2006.<br/>

I live in Tucson and am terribly sad that I didn't know about the <br/>
letterboxing meeting event here. I should have been reading the <br/>
postings on this site but got busy elsewhere...live and learn, I <br/>
guess.<br/>

We're sorry we missed you too! It's always nice to<br/>
meet fellow letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe next year!<br/>
