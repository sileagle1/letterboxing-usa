What a wonderful day we had! There were 44 people--including 2 babies and 3 <br/>
dogs! We had 15 boxes to find (in one park!) tons of food to eat and great new <br/>
friends to make. We had Amanda from Seattle, A-Bear from Idaho and Silent Doug <br/>
from PA to make it a 4-state triumph and Sir Balthazar and Jugglermouse from <br/>
way down in San Luis Obispo. Lizzardbutt, Hungry Eye and their family, <br/>
PrincessLea, Snail Lady, Turtle Leader and their crew and a bunch of enthusiastic <br/>
newbies too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who attended and made the day exceed our expectations--and <br/>
believe me, our expectations are always high!!<br/>
<br/>
There are photos and I'll get to posting them soon!<br/>

Thanks so much to you folks who threw this great bash, hid the <br/>
wonderful boxes, and thought of so many things to make the gathering <br/>
a success.  Now I REALLY can't wait for October 4th in S.L.O!<br/>

Is your bee sting okay?  I think that was our only casualty of a busy day.....<br/>
