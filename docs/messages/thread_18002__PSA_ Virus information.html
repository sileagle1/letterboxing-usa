<br/>
As you may or may not know, many viruses can send email from your computer to<br/>
everyone in your address book.  The webmaster account ( webmasters @<br/>
letterboxing.org ) has been deluged with these automatically sent email viruses.<br/>
While Yahoo does filter them out, they do get in the way of us answering<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you have our address in your address book, we would GREATLY appreciate it<br/>
if you would scan your computer for viruses.<br/>
<br/>
You can do a free scan of your computer from several places on the internet.<br/>
Here's a good one:<br/>
http://us.mcafee.com/root/mfs/default.asp<br/>
(This is not an endorsement.  Just a well know company.  Neither Wes nor any of<br/>
his relatives do not work for McAfee.)<br/>
<br/>
If you don't like that one, here's a list:<br/>
http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Security_and_Encryption/Viruses_and_<br/>
Worms/Online_Virus_Scanners/<br/>
<br/>
Please, take a moment to ensure that you're virus free. <br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, I'll be more than happy to answer questions.  <br/>
Just get in touch with me off-list:<br/>
http://www.wesgarrison.us/Contact.asp<br/>
<br/>
. . . or ask your favorite friend or relative that deals with computers.  <br/>
