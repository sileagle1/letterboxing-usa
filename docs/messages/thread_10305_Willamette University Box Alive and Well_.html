day for the last three days, I needed to get out and walk around a <br/>
bit, so I decided to introduce 3 of my friends to letterboxing.  How <br/>
easy it was when there was a letterbox right on our very campus! <br/>
<br/>
I thought I would send out a message to thank Windairen for her <br/>
awesome letterbox and to tell her that I have never seen it on the <br/>
actual Oregon letterbox page---I had to search the archives for it.  <br/>
Maybe you need to repost the clues so that others see it and come to <br/>
our beautiful campus and (hopefully) become inspired to plant more <br/>
boxes in Salem!  I loved that the clues required some historical <br/>
fact digging!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm trying hard to get more boxes around Salem, but it has been a <br/>
rather slow process so far--a new Salem box should be sprouting up <br/>
soon though! <br/>
