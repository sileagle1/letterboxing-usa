After reports of some boxes missing, I have replaced one missing box (Box #1) and changed its location to make it harder to find, and I have ADDED a fourth Food Fight! Box for your boxing pleasure. Those boxers who originally collected all three boxes will want to return to the park to find the replacement box #1 and the new box #4, since the locations and stamps will be new for them.<br/>
<br/>
For the people who couldn't find Box #3, it is in place and in good condition. Keep looking!<br/>
<br/>
Webmaster, please replace my original clues with the following:<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: boxitup (Renee of Richmond)<br/>
Box series name: Food Fight! (Deep Run Park)<br/>
Number of Boxes: 4<br/>
Difficulty: easy1 to 1  miles on paved trails<br/>
Date placed: Christmas Day 2002 and January 11, 2003<br/>
State: VA<br/>
County: Henrico<br/>
Nearest town: Richmond<br/>
COMPASS NEEDED<br/>
<br/>
This is a very popular and well-traveled park with many picnic tables and activity areas, so be discreet when stamping in these boxes. <br/>
<br/>
To get to Deep Run Park from downtown Richmond, take I-64 west to Exit 180, Gaskins Road South. Continue one mile down Gaskins to Ridgefield Parkway (stoplight) and turn right. Take the next right into Deep Run Park and park in this first parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Food Fight Box #1<br/>
1.	Take the trail marked Shelter 3, restrooms and go straight down this trail.<br/>
2.	At the restrooms crossroads right past the picnic table on your left, look to your left down toward the playground and lake. Go down that way.<br/>
3.	Take a right at the lake. <br/>
4.	At the three-way intersection, take the rightmost paved path.<br/>
5.	60 paces down this path, you will see an unpaved bike path dipping off to your right and crossing another paved path. Go that way.<br/>
6.	At the first set of blue exercise equipment, take the left fork of the path.<br/>
7.	At the next set of blue exercise equipment (two uneven bars), take a compass reading of 160 degrees.<br/>
8.	Going in that direction of 160 degrees, walk 23 paces into the woods. In that fallen log is Box #1.<br/>
<br/>
Food Fight Box #2<br/>
1.	Return to the three-way intersection and take and take the leftmost path, the one <br/>
that follows the lake shore.<br/>
2.	At the T-intersection, cross over the wooden bridge. Coming up on your right will be a large nature pavilion and gazebo with lots of decking. Turn right on the paved path as if you were going to the pavilion, but stay on the paved path.<br/>
3.	A few paces past the pavilion entrance, you will see a small wooden sign that says compass course. Staying on the paved path, walk 25 paces. See that pine-needle-covered path on the right? Take it.<br/>
4.	At the T-intersection, which is 13 paces past the large double-trunked pine tree, take a compass reading. Take the path that goes off at 60 degrees.<br/>
5.	At 88 paces down this path, before you cross the little stream, look directly to your right. You should see three large pine trees 23 paces away. Go to the bases of these trees. Under a smaller fallen pine is Food Fight! #2.<br/>
<br/>
Food Fight Box #3<br/>
1.	Go back to the pine-needle path and continue in the direction you had been going (toward the stream, that is). Follow the trail as it winds to the left. You will not have to cross the stream.<br/>
2.	 Cross over the fallen logs on the path.<br/>
3.	You will soon come to the paved path again. Go right on the paved path, passing a second parking area and picnic facilities on your left. Continue on this main path as it goes uphill.<br/>
4.	Go right at the intersection at the top of the hill and walk for a good while.<br/>
5.	 At the T-intersection, go left.<br/>
6.	A short distance past this last intersection, you will see a tree marked with a wooden sign that says yellow poplar.<br/>
7.	With your rear end on this sign, take a compass reading directly north. Crossing the path and going into the woods on the other side for 17 paces, you will see a small tree that has a large, strangely-shaped base that forms a big hole. #3 is in this hole, buried under a lot of leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Food Fight Box #4<br/>
<br/>
1.	Return to the paved path and continue down it. Soon you will cross a vehicular road. As soon as you cross this road, you will immediately see a paved path that goes off to the right. Take it.<br/>
2.	Go 65 paces down this path to a medium-sized rock on the right side of the path.<br/>
3.	From the rock, take a compass reading of 185 degrees and, crossing the path and entering the woods, take 28 paces toward that odd, leaning tree.<br/>
4.	In a cavity in the horizontal part of this leaning tree is Food Fight #4.<br/>
<br/>
To return to your parking area: Retrace your 65 paces from the rock and return to the path you were on before you took the detour to the right. Continue on that main path (taking no side paths) until you reach another vehicular crossing. Your parking area is up and to the right, across the road.<br/>

Thanks for another in this fun series, Renee.  I'm hoping everyone <br/>
will find a way to be very discreet in light of the always-busy <br/>
park.  You've done a great job finding hiding spots where the boxes <br/>
won't be visible...it'll just depend on the discreet retrieval and <br/>
careful replacement of them.  They should be around a long time for <br/>
all to enjoy and experience this very lovely suburban park.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. To Marsha.....on your mark, get set....GO!....Just kidding ;-)<br/>
