<br/>
There has been much talk about using ammo boxes for stashing <br/>
letterboxes.  While they are useful and probably work really well, <br/>
please allow me to relay something (no censors, please!) from some <br/>
geocachers that I met while doing box maintenance on day:<br/>
<br/>
There has been a series of gaocache thefts in the greater Lehigh <br/>
Valley area (Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton, PA).  Somebody has been <br/>
targeting geocaches and stealing them.  But, the slimeball has only <br/>
been stealing geocaches that are in AMMO BOXES!  Other containers <br/>
seems to be immune from theft.  Now, geocachers typically describe <br/>
the container a cache is in on their website (www.geocaching.com), so <br/>
all this cretin needs to do is look it up on the website, decide <br/>
which cache to steal, fire up their GPS unit and tromp over and make <br/>
the theft.  This has gotten the local cachers justifiably upset:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think that letterboxes may become a target if we make our boxes too <br/>
easy to find an advertise what container they are in.  Just a caution <br/>
against such slimy behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
