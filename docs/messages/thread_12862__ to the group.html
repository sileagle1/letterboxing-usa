I put a little note inside boxes 2 &amp; 4 explaining that there is no log book.<br/>
I did this because box 2 is near box #1 and box 4 is near box 3. (hope that<br/>

Quick question to the group. Letterbox series that you have planted,<br/>
do you put a log book in each box? Has any one just put a stamp in<br/>
the first few with the log book in the last? How would you feel if<br/>
you found a series that was set up this way?<br/>
Okay a couple of questions and I know there are no rules, I value<br/>
your input.<br/>

A microbox is a very small version of a letterbox.  These are most commonly<br/>
in film cannisters, or Altoids Tins (but those aren't very waterproof, so<br/>
they don't work everywhere).  These might have a small log - or scroll of<br/>
paper rather than a book, and a tiny stamp - no ink usually (a good reminder<br/>
to always bring your own).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have a better description of a microbox??<br/>

A description of a microbox from Scarab (see the "Egypt Explorer" <br/>
letterbox in Washington, D.C.):<br/>
<br/>
"I take two film cannisters and tape the together bottom to bottom. I <br/>
blacken the lids so they are not so easy to see. In one end fits an <br/>
eraser size stamp. I cut 1 inch long and 3/4 inch wide strips of <br/>
paper and staple them to a 1 and 3/4 inch length of pencil. The <br/>
pencil piece makes the long thin paper strips easy to roll up in a <br/>
scroll. The scoll log is rubber banded and goes in the other end of <br/>
the film cannisters."<br/>
<br/>
As to where to get more information (and all the clues), go to:<br/>

Hope this helps<br/>
