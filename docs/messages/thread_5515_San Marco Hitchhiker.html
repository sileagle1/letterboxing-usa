<br/>
I am so excited to hear a little news of our San Marco Hitchhiker!!<br/>
I carved that large image out of Staedtler MasterCarve.  I own an art rubber <br/>
stamp store in Essex, CT and carry all sizes of this wonderful carving medium <br/>
- the largest being a 9x12 sheet - plenty to carve good sized stamps! <br/>
<br/>
I  would love to know the travels the San Marco HH has had since I planted it <br/>
in our San Marco Box in Feb 2001. THe San Marco Box (Florida) is now an <br/>
orphan as family has moved since the loss of both of our parents.  We (the <br/>
Logsdon Clan made up of Kathleen-EssexLady and Ruthann-Mirkwood) would <br/>
appreciate any updates on the box and would greatly appreciate care as needed <br/>
to it from you Florida boxers if that is possible.<br/>
<br/>
 Haven't gotten out recently to find any boxes here in boxing heaven but <br/>
Ruthann is visiting Connecticut in July and we will definitely get out <br/>
together. If any of you CT letterboxers want to join in Ruthann will be <br/>
teaching two stamp carving classes at my store in Essex the week of July 15. <br/>
