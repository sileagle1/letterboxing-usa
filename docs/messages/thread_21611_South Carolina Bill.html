The National Forests are managed by the USDA, not the NPS and they <br/>
don't care where you go in them as long as you don't take vehicles <br/>
in prohibitted areas.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of places to box outside of the areas that SC wants <br/>
to prohibit.  I don't like the bill but if it is passed, it won't  <br/>
stop LB or geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
Mark, your idea of a poll makes a lot of sense no matter what.   We <br/>
are getting a lot of new people and a limited set of guidelines <br/>
could be useful.  Could we use the geocache rules as a go-by?<br/>
