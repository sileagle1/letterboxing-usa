                    <div class="plaintext-content">FYI, "Walden" and "I Can't Carve" were both placed yesterday.  Clues<br/>
available on my website or via the links on LbNA and AQ.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Red Horse, my first box, has been removed as a mystery box in<br/>
order to promote more visitors.  It's location has been posted on all<br/>
sites!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, unfortunately another of my first boxes, Mary's Lamb, has<br/>
been destroyed due to construction.  It will be replaced, although no<br/>
time line has been established.<br/>
<br/>
More details are included in a longer post on the LbNE board ...<br/>

Looking forward to MooseHill Mach 3!  I haven't been to a gathering<br/>
since the Mystery gathering last October!<br/>
