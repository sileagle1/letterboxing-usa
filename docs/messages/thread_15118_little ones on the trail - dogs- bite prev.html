As for drawing attention with the dogs, you can use it to your advantage if the dog has a good stay or you have another person with you. Set the dog (with another handler if possible) a little ways away from the 'exposed public box' and everyone will be watching the dog, not you. Even better is if the handler has the dog doing tricks, or you can have to dog do tricks while it stays a distance away from you. Just before you are ready to grab the box, cue the dog to do a trick that takes a few seconds to complete, just enough time to grab the box while people are watching the dog 'perform' :-) You can also take out a plastic bag and act like you are 'cleaning up' the box, few people choose to watch that activity! :-) It's helpful to teach the dog to lay down when you stop and get out your boxin' gear. That way you don't have to worry about what they are getting into while you are stamping in &amp; they can get a reward for laying quietly <so boxes="" do="" equal="" reward!="" the=""><br/>
<br/>
If the box is not exposed and hidden in the woods, just box as usual, just waiting for a 'break in the trail traffic' to get the box. If I get an 'attachment' of the small two legged variety, that wants to follow me on the trail, I just tell the kid to find it's parent, or if the parent is there, tell them I have to get back to 'training' my dog(s). Usually that is enough of a cue that I no longer want their attention &amp; I can get back to boxin'. <br/>
<br/>
As a side note, I almost always take the opportunity to teach kids about safety around dogs and bite prevention if the opportunity presents itself. Also, thank any child that has enough respect to ASK before they pet your dog! <br/>
<br/>
For any parents that are interested, email me OFF LIST and I can send you a 'word' attachment that has the info I hand out at bite prevention talks. Two of the sheets are for the kids, two are for the parents.<br/>

Stay safe out there,<br/>

I tried to take my great dane (a great companion) with me to plant a letterbox but I quickly realized he attracted toooooo much attention. So much for taking him for a walk AND letterboxing at the same time! And, he thinks there should be something for him to eat in every bowl (box).<br/>
