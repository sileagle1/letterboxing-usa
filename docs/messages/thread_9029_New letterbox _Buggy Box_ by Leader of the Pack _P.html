<h2>Buggy Box</h2>
<p>Buggy Box , Upper Leacock Township, Lancaster County, 
Pa. Planted 11/4/02 Planted by : Leader of the Pack Rated : Easy - drive 
up</p>
<p>The Buggy Box, take Rte 772 between New Holland and 
the village of Intercourse. This is also known as Newport Road. About half way 
between the two towns is the intersection with Stumptown Road. Turn onto 
Stumptown and park on the right at Mascot Park. There is an early mill, the 
Mascot Roller Mill across the street a place you will hope to be able to get the 
free tour if they are there that day. Bring your camera, the mill and house and 
arn next door are great photo opportunities.</p>
<p>The Buggy Box; At Mascot Park, walk along toward 772. 
You need to cross over the sluiceway and go toward the bridge. Be very careful 
with children! Where the guardrail meets the bridge over the river is a great 
spot to take a picture. While standing there look down at the rocks that are on 
the slope. One is a very distinct gray with white stripes. Above and behind this 
is the buggy box hidden behind another stone. Please replace stones carefully. 
Use your camera to mask your real purpose of visiting the park and viewing the 
dam and waterfall.</p>
<p>As always have fun and be safe! Especially crossing 
the sluice a by the road.</p>
