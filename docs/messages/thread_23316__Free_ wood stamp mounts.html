<br/>
I just got a box of wood stamp mounts which I bought in bulk. I'm  <br/>
offering some to anyone wants them:<br/>
<br/>
I've taken out a the ones that I want, but I can't use them all --  <br/>
mainly because I'm not going to cut them down to the size(s) I prefer.<br/>
There are many here that can be used as-is, or cut into smaller  <br/>
pieces to suit you. (I'm going to use mine with the stamps I carve  <br/>
with the Speedball Speedy stamp blocks; "the pink stuff.")<br/>
<br/>
Please see the photo of this lot at my website: http://cablespeed.com/ <br/>

<br/>
All that I'll ship to you are pictured.... They range from 4.5 by 5  <br/>
inches all the way down to the smallest, which is 1.25 by 1.25  <br/>
inches.) They do have some little flaws here and there... on edges,  <br/>
etc... but every one of them, imho, could be used for a letterbox  <br/>
stamp. They are made of hard white maple, and are 3/4 inch high. The  <br/>
sides are all hourglass; a couple of the smallest ones don't have the  <br/>
hourglass edges.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like these leftovers, I offer them at only the cost  <br/>
to ship to you. The weight of the box is 7 lbs, 8 oz.<br/>
You can figure the cost on USPS online; I'll charge just what I pay  <br/>
to ship them at the post office. (Or UPS if you prefer; just let me  <br/>
know.)<br/>
<br/>
Email me if you're interested... I'll send you more info.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
