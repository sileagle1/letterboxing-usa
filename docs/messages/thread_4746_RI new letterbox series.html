along the South Kingtown Bike Path in Rhode Island.<br/>

The Hills Are Alive Letterbox Series (7)<br/>
South Kingstown Bike Path<br/>
West Kingston, RI<br/>
<br/>
The clues to this adventure will take you along the South Kingstown Bike Path <br/>
so that you may choose to ride, rollerblade (bring shoes) or walk on this <br/>
excursion.  The bike path is about 4.5 miles one way.  There are seven boxes <br/>
hidden along the sides of the bike path or a very short jaunt (no more than a <br/>
couple hundred feet) into the woods, so if you ride be prepared to get on and <br/>
off your bike.  This series can be broken down into smaller segments.  <br/>
Perhaps dividing 2-2-3 or 4-3.  Some of the locations are slightly exposed to <br/>
pedestrian traffic so please use discretion.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: The adventure begins at the parking lot to the Kingston <br/>
Train Station in West Kingston on Rt. 138(midway between the junctions with <br/>
rt2 and rt110).  From 95 take exit 3 to 138E.  Follow 138 about 8 miles to <br/>
the train station on the right.  From the North - take Rt 1South to 138West <br/>
past URI to the train station on the left.  Park your car in the Southwest <br/>
corner of the lot where the bike path begins.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Begin your journey on the bike path near the railroad tracks.  After <br/>
crossing Liberty Lane, the wooden rail marking the approach to the road ends <br/>
and there's a short path on the right which leads to a pine needle strewn <br/>
clearing.  Stand at the edge of the clearing and take 20 paces at 270 to a <br/>
large white pine with several trunks.  On the far side, a small rock has a <br/>
secret to reveal.  Reemerge back on the bike trail and continue on your way.<br/>
    After the sign for the Great Swamp, you will cross the Chipuxet River <br/>
Bridge.     <br/>
Stand on the left side of the path at the end of the rail.  Take 20 paces at <br/>
70 and claim your prize in an old stump.<br/>
    Continue on your way across Ministerial Road and (the minute) Larkin Pond <br/>
Road.  After crossing White Horn Brook you will soon cross a culvert.  Look <br/>
to the ridge on the left where there are some white pines.  A big boulder and <br/>
a rhodedendrum mark the start of a wide path at the top of a small hill.  Go <br/>
up the hill and enter.  Take a quick right after the rhodedendrum on to a <br/>
smaller path then immediately veer left towards a stone wall.  Follow the <br/>
stone wall to the left then around its corner to Historic Cemetery 17.  Stand <br/>
at the Historic Marker and take a compass heading of 300.  Find what you <br/>
seek low in the wall behind the 2 trunked tree.  Return to the bike path and <br/>
continue on your journey.  If you have an odometer take a reading.  The next <br/>
box is about .6 miles.<br/>
    You will pass a large grassy hill on the left that leads to a housing <br/>
development. Take note of the right rail.  The 2nd section of right rail <br/>
ends.  Continue past the scattering of boulders on your right for about 1/10 <br/>
of a mile to find 3 knee high boulders sitting along the right side of the <br/>
path.  Opposite there is a small white pine (possibly newly planted) and a <br/>
tree whose roots make a hollow at its base.  Sit on the largest of the knee <br/>
high boulders with your feet toward the bike path.  Reach under the anvil <br/>
shaped rock on your left .  Lo and behold!<br/>
    Forging onward, cross over South Road, pass the 3 mile marker and stop to <br/>
find a trail on the left.  Take it down the hill and go left again over the <br/>
bridges.  Go up the hill and continue to where there is a convergence of 3 <br/>
orange stones, 4 maple trunks and a path to the left.  Stand on the smallest <br/>
orange stone and take a compass sighting of 115.  Find a young sapling with <br/>
2 trunks that looks different from the others (grey birch?) about 25 feet off <br/>
the trail.  The prize is in the roots of that sapling.<br/>
Return to the bike path and continue your quest.<br/>
    Cross Curtis Corner Road and keep on across Asa Pond Road.  After passing <br/>
a big corrugated metal building, there will be a stairway down the hill to <br/>
the left leading to Tri Pond Park.  Go down the stairway and across the <br/>
planks.  Stand on the end of the last plank and look to the left.  At that <br/>
point there is a hollow in the stone wall with a secret to share.  Return to <br/>
the bike path and journey onward.<br/>
    You will come upon a culvert marked by railings on both sides of the <br/>
trail.  Go over the culvert then leave the bike path on the white blazed <br/>
trail to the right.  Follow the white blazed trail over a first stone wall <br/>
and to a second.  Stop at the second stone wall.  Look north along the wall <br/>
to a fallen log.  Midway between the log and the path in the eastern side of <br/>
the wall (about 5 feet away) your cup will runneth over.<br/>
    Your quest is now complete.  Head back to the bike path.  Turn left to go <br/>
home.   <br/>
