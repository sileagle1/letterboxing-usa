Ryan Carpenter and I hunted for the Stinky Marsh Crab box in Alameda, <br/>
CA on Monday and we could not find it.  (And the area was very stinky <br/>
and marshy!) :-P<br/>

But the week prior, we had great success finding the Uva's Canyon box <br/>
in Morgan Hill!  You win some, you lose some.<br/>
