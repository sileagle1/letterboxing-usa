Dinosaur Footprints Reservation <br/>
Holyoke, MA (Hampden County)<br/>
<br/>
Placed: October 23, 2003 by TehutiKa, AsetKa and kids!<br/>
<br/>
Distance: Less than 1/2 a mile<br/>
Time: Depends on how long you stay and play!<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Going north on Route I-91, take exit 17A<br/>
(Route 141 east) towards Holyoke. Turn left onto Route<br/>
5 north and follow for 2.2 mi. Entrance on right.<br/>
Going south on Route I-91, take exit 18 and follow<br/>
Route 5 south towards Holyoke for 5.2 mi. Entrance on<br/>
left. Park in small roadside pull-out (7 cars).<br/>
<br/>
Dinosaur footprints, fossilized plants, and delicate<br/>
ripple marks of a prehistoric pool are preserved in<br/>
stone at this reservation near the west bank of the<br/>
Connecticut River. Since at least 1860, ichnologists<br/>
(those who study fossil tracks) have acclaimed the<br/>
Connecticut River Valley for its abundance of<br/>
paleontological specimens, especially dinosaur tracks.<br/>
This reservation is owned by the Trustees of the<br/>
Reservations. For more info about this fine<br/>
organization, go to http://www.thetrustees.org<br/>
<br/>
Clues: This park is a family favorite. We were out<br/>
getting new ink pads when my youngest found a stamp in<br/>
the discount bin that he thought was good for this<br/>
park. Hopefully you'll agree!<br/>
<br/>
Walk down the trail and across the boardwalk to the<br/>
footprints. Once you check them out, head across the<br/>
Boston and Maine railroad tracks down to the river's<br/>
edge. If you're lucky, like we are, you'll get to see<br/>
a train up close and personal!<br/>
<br/>
Down at the water, to your right you'll see a trail.<br/>
Head towards it. You will quickly see a five trunk<br/>
tree next to a four trunk tree. To the right of the<br/>
four trunk tree is a long flat rock. The letterbox is<br/>
wedged in deeply in a cervaise, near the top of the<br/>
rock, on the left. A small stone is wedged in front of<br/>
it to make sure that it can't be seen accidentally.<br/>
Please rehide carefully!<br/>
