I think this is actually a better idea because you are correct that some boxes are too small. Trying to fit a hh in a box that is too small could get both the hh and host box ruined if it doesn't shut well. Do mark the box clearly as a hitchhiker. It has been done before by others and does seem to work well. Have fun. ...Chuck &amp; Molly P36F134X19 Mansfield CT

                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>We've only found one hitchhiker so far, and it was in it's own box. The only problem I potentially could see with this approach is that some hiding places may not be large enough to accomadate two boxes, which means you might need to hang onto a HH for a little while. But the same problem exists if you've got a HH without a box, and the next one you find is too small to fit it. 
<br/>
<br/>I think it is simply a matter of personal taste.
