                    <div class="plaintext-content">The best copies are those from a machine that uses a heat fusible toner also<br/>
called by some carbon or powdered ink. During the process the toner is held<br/>
to the paper with a static charge and then "ironed" or cooked on to the<br/>
paper with heat and pressure. If the machine jams you will often find a copy<br/>
that the print rubs or blows off the paper. This is the right type!<br/>
<br/>
If you use these machines make the copy as dark as possible and still<br/>
usable, it will usually give you more toner making for a better transfer.<br/>

&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those following the "Great Transfer Method Debate,"<br/>
&gt; below, please see a P.S. from April at Stampeaz regarding the hot iron<br/>
transfer method.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know there are new group members too who may want to catch up on this<br/>
subject because many want to carve their own personal and letterbox stamps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Might I suggest the curious go to the group board and look through and<br/>
read posts from around the first part of this month with subject lines<br/>
referring to various transfer methods previously discussed? There is some<br/>
very good information there from those who are partial to one transfer<br/>
method or another.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Subject: Re: Hot Iron Image Transfer Method<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; P.S.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You have to be sure that the Laser or Xerox printer<br/>
&gt; &gt; uses Carbon<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ink.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My last trip to Mail Boxes etc. gave me copies that<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn't transfer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had to re-copy them with my laser printer that<br/>
&gt; &gt; uses carbon ink.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; -April"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this is helpful.<br/>
