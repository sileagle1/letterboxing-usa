<br/>
<br/>Driving Directions:  See <b>Past Lives II</b>.
<br/>
<br/>Clues:  Having found Past Lives II, continue along the path.  As you walk along, you marvel at the similarities between these woods and the Canadian wilds.  Then you remember that in a past life you were a voyageur.  This is nothing more than a short portage!  At the confluence of two creeks, the trail heads up hill and to the west.  Follow the trail past a large tree that has fallen across the creek and a roll of rusted fencing.  From the fencing count 36 paces and take a heading of 90 degrees on the up hill trail, crossing over a small bridge.  Follow this trail to the top of the hill and on to the picnic shelter.  At the picnic shelter, find the door with the letter S.  From this door walk a heading of 100 degrees for 50 paces.  One pace = two steps or approx. 5 feet.  You should be in the woods a little bit and at a stump covered with ground cover.  Under this stump you may find <b>Past Lives III</b>.  
<br/>
<br/>If for some reason you are not the Voyageur type and based in the here and now,  simply walk past the big downhill and continue on the roadway to the picnic shelter.</body></html>
