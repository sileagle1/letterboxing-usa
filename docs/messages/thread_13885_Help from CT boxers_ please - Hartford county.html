                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out the the MDC reservoir in West Hartford this afternoon and <br/>
tried to find the Phoenix tree letterbox, but was, sadly, thwarted.  <br/>
Probably due to my own ignorance.  Definitely due to the onset of <br/>
dusk.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm hoping for is this.  I have carved a stamp for this poor <br/>
orphaned box and left it near the water tanks.  Could someone, who <br/>
has either found the box or would like to find the box, contact me <br/>
after they have picked up the stamp and placed it in the box?  I will <br/>
let the web masters know that the clues can be changed to not reflect <br/>
the missing stamp.  Then I will pick your brain for somewhat more <br/>
precise clues and try to figure out where I went wrong.  I will tell <br/>
you that it's actually a rather hideous stamp taken from a medieval <br/>
woodcut.  Hopefully that won't deter any helpers.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - <br/>

these are the clues to the stamp and ink pad's very temporary <br/>
location.<br/>
<br/>
In between the two giant water tanks is a small brick house.(And yes, <br/>
I began to sing as I typed that)  With your back to the door turn <br/>
right and walk ten steps.  The stamp and an ink pad are resting under <br/>
a concrete block fragment near the underbrush.<br/>
