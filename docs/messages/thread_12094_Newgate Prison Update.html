                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent the day in Granby yesterday chasing a prisoner through the <br/>
woods.  We found all four boxes and the Field Day HH in the last <br/>
one.  Boxes 1 and 2 were fine, but box 3 was wet inside.  We dried <br/>
out the box, and fortunately the ziplocs kept everything mostly dry.  <br/>
The top of the stamp pad and box 4 was broken, so it's a little <br/>
messy, but otherwise ok.  The logbooks are getting quite full also.  <br/>
It was a wonderful hike.  We also picked up some DEP boxes yesterday, <br/>
all in good shape.  We found the Salmon River, Tunxis, and People's <br/>
SF boxes.  And we set the Vagabond Vulture HH loose to fly some.  <br/>
Hopefully someone will find him soon.<br/>
