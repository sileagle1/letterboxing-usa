I'm curious why a highway weigh station was used, and not a rest area, but what do I know?  There may not be one!  Planters should take the situations into account, but who knows beforehand how popular an area may become?  Don't beat yourself up about it.  And thanks for the concern to ask - it speaks well of yourself and our community of friends and other loonies that we do worry about the etiquette!<br/>

Honestly in most cases, I would rather pass up the box and/or replacement until a <br/>
better time than be obvious and give away the hiding spot. It isn't worth going to <br/>
the trouble to explain the endeavour to official type folks. I try to avoid that <br/>

<br/>
When in doubt, consider the location and whether or not you can just come back <br/>
another time. There are many of my boxes that would not be advisable to look for <br/>
on certain times of the day and especially when you're with a young child. Just be <br/>
warned that letterbox placers are devoid of most responsibility in that regard.<br/>
<br/>
The letterboxing north america site as well as other personal web pages usually <br/>
post a disclaimer statement regarding this liability. I find that common sense <br/>
usually also comes in handy. Good luck! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree that it is better to pass up the find or <br/>
replacement rather than risk compromising the hiding spot if the <br/>
area is too busy or has suddenly become busy.  That being said...  <br/>
if you have the box in hand, have carried it away a bit to stamp in <br/>
only to return and find that you are not safely able to access the <br/>
hiding spot, there are a few things to consider before you take the <br/>
box home with you.  Most importantly -- how will you get the box <br/>
back and when?  If you personally are not able to come back to <br/>
rehide the box, who can?  Does the placer live in the area (you may <br/>
or may not know this)?  Would you be able to mail the box to the <br/>
placer or another letterboxer in the area so that it could be <br/>
returned to the hiding spot?<br/>
<br/>
In any event, if it is absoletely necessary for you to take a box <br/>
home, you should at the very least let the placer know that you have <br/>
done so, the reason why and what the arrangements are for getting it <br/>
back in place.  The placer may or may not want to make a note on the <br/>
clues or post to the list that the box is out of commission for a <br/>
few days.<br/>
<br/>
When we were in NYC, we encountered a situation in a very busy, high <br/>
security area where we waited a couple of hours to be able to return <br/>
a box to its hiding place because a young mother and two screaming <br/>
toddlers had taken up temporary residence at the hiding spot.  But <br/>
being from out-of-town and knowing the placer also did not live <br/>
nearby, we were reluctant to leave with the box.<br/>
<br/>
I also know of a situation where a 'boxer took a letterbox home (to <br/>
another state) because the area became too busy, and then walked <br/>
around with it in their backpack for several days (weeks?).  As the <br/>
box had been part of a series and they had stamped into the logs of <br/>
the other boxes, somebody happened to contact them asking if <br/>
the "missing" box had been in place at the time they were there, and <br/>
come to find out, it had been walking around at the bottom of their <br/>
backpack!<br/>
<br/>
Common sense and courtesy...<br/>
