<br/>
  I just voted. I would add another selection....What's the best part  about letterboxing? Getting a new stamp in my personal logbook. <br/>
<br/>
  But if you had it as a choice, it would be a difficult toss-up between  that and going to new places. Lucky for me the first selection in your  poll hasn't happened to me, well not while letterboxing anyway. :)<br/>
<br/>
  BTW your blog doesn't work with FireFox, but it does with Internet Explorer.<br/>
