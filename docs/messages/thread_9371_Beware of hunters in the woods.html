will not be going letterboxing in hunting areas until hunting season <br/>

I finally figured out the clues to Wanda &amp; Pete's Dancing Men.  I <br/>
knew the area was a hunting area, but was so excited I didn't want to <br/>
wait til hunting season was over.  So I donned my largest, most <br/>
florescent orange (you couldn't even see black fur on my Labrador <br/>
Retriever Sky she has so much orange on.)  I headed out, clues in <br/>
hand.  There were several hunter's cars parked at the trail head.  <br/>
That didn't slow me down, hunter's are safety conscious, right?  <br/>
<br/>
Well, to make a long story longer, I got the Dancing Men and three <br/>
other letterboxes on Satureday but felt really exposed while <br/>
searching in the woods for them.  I ran into 3 hunters on the trail <br/>
(all with very big guns.)  And cringed every time a gun went off.<br/>
<br/>
I got home saturday afternoon feeling very good about my letterboxing <br/>
day.  Went to sleep that night, and don't you know on the news on <br/>
Sunday, a hunter accidently shot and killed his friend while hunting <br/>
in the woods in RI. Well, if that didn't freak me out nothing ever <br/>
will.  (you may remember last year a man accidently shot and killed <br/>
his own son hunting in RI)<br/>

I don't think you could pay me enough to go back out into the woods <br/>
while hunters are out there.  Even dressed in orange from head to toe.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, that is certainly a wakeup call.  I have to tell you that The <br/>
Yacthsman and I (Mary Manatee) stopped at Hannah Robinson's Tower on <br/>
our way to a letterboxing event with some friends on Sunday.  From the <br/>
tower, the sound of gunshots could be heard in all directions!  A <br/>
little off-putting to say the least.  After meeting the friends in <br/>
southern Rhode Island, we all decided to go boxing in CT instead of <br/>
RI--- there is no hunting on Sundays in that state.  Had a great <br/>
day, and am very glad we decided to move southwards!<br/>

Accidents happen.  <br/>
<br/>
Hunters by and large are very safe.  Consider that they have a weapon and there are thousands of them out in the woods during hunting season .... if they were not a safety conscience group many more accidents would happen AND the news media would be hopping all over each one.<br/>
<br/>
That said,  I don't go letterboxing in areas open to hunting during deer hunting season.  <br/>
NO, hunters will not shoot you for messing up their chance to kill a deer BUT accidents happen and even in the best groups of people there might be one idiot.<br/>
<br/>
Consider also that the sound of a gunshot travels a long way, if you are not familiar with guns you might not be able to judge how far away or close you are to the hunter (even the "whiz" sound may be deceiving).<br/>
<br/>
Thought, the guns used to hunt deer and elk shoot the longer distances, Squirrel season is open during the summer, rabbit season is open now, and turkey season is in April, dove is in there somewhere. Those are the seasons my husband is interested in.... but I know that duck, pheasant and other seasons are open through out the year also.   <br/>
It doesn't hurt to wear blaze orange all year 'round when in the woods.  It could help if you ever fall or get lost.<br/>
