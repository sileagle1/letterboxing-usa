all but one of the Rock Creek (not near the playground though...the hail<br/>
became ferocious) letterboxes. I couldn't find the one that, "is over where<br/>
you go under"... but the mosquitos found me to be sure...another day, I<br/>
guess. It's neat to have the stamps in my book that I've seen on the<br/>
internet. I can't wait to hide some of my own...I've got to get the stamps<br/>
made though, so no breath-holding.  I'm looking forward to finding the rest!<br/>

<br/>
you want to find the rest in Minnesota?  we don't have any mosquitos<br/>
(yet)...<br/>
and the snow is almost gone now (just kidding).  my letterboxes are<br/>
lonely, no stamp-ins yet that I am aware of.  Of course I haven't been<br/>
back to visit split rock since I placed it last August.  if anyone<br/>
passes<br/>
thru this way make sure you stamp up. Deborah, Steve and Rachel are the<br/>
closest letterboxers to me and they're 5 hours+ away.  So, if you happen<br/>
to be in town on business make sure you visit Fort Snelling in St. PAul<br/>
or Split Rock Lighthouse at Lake Superior. Thanks -dan<br/>
<br/>
ps.  i'll be putting Eric's first Florida box on the web site a little<br/>
later.<br/>
that should be good news for you SC and NC folks as well as Florida<br/>
folks.<br/>
