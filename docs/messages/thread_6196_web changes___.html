<div>I, like many others, am relatively new to 
letterboxing.  I've become quite obsessed, and have been following the 
discussion of possible web changes closely.  I think Candlelight and others 
are on the right track.... it would probably create a greater sense of 
"responsibility" for boxes if the owner posted clues on their personal pages, 
then linked to the main LBNA page.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That said, I do think the graphic design of the 
LBNA web site is great, and I think uniformity of clue listings makes it more 
accessible and pleasing to the eye. It would be nice to have a downloadable 
form that contained all the elements of a standard clue posting (the graphics 
and uniform font), and the user simply filled in the blanks, then linked it to 
their own web pages. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't have a lot of expertise with web design 
(just the basics), so I don't know how feasible this idea is.  I'm willing 
to help out with whatever needs doing....I can always learn!</div>

those who desire the changes and to help out the webmasters that is<br/>
great.  Please, however, if things do change, let there be a way to post<br/>
clues besides a link to the placer's web page.  <br/>
<br/>
Some of us have e-mail and web access only, but no computer or software<br/>
and some of us are pretty limited in the brain department when it comes<br/>
to this type of technology.  If I have to set up some sort of web page<br/>
to post my clues I'm a goner.  Not everybody on this list can be accused<br/>
of being too bright (uh...that means me).  <br/>
