Actually you can see a few pictures of me and many of Molly on my website <a href="http://www.chuckstraub.com">www.chuckstraub.com</a> The most recent picture of me would be on my site under letterboxing. The Mystery Gathering pictures. There is a picture of Jay Drew and myself. Just picture me mostly bald under that hat. I do hope we meet someday on the trail. Molly really is better in real life than the pictures. Great friend and letterboxer.She loves everyone. .....Chuck and Molly
