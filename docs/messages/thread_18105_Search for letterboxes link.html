Hmmm, I just tried it- no problems (on my end)<br/>
Perhaps it is the browser you're using?  I know that a mac displays things differently <br/>
at times. For instance, the Safari and Internet Explorer browsers will not give you a <br/>
scrolling option when you wish to search by placer versus the Netscape browser <br/>
which does.<br/>

It's working for me.  If you're headed to or near Baton Rouge and <br/>
you still can't get the clues, email me and I'll send them to you <br/>
personally.  I've planted most of the boxes in Baton Rouge.  Found 4 <br/>
and planted 12 - gives you an idea of the sad state of boxing (so <br/>
far) in this part of the state.  (and one of the 4 I found was in <br/>
California.)<br/>
<br/>
BUT - I gave stamp-carving lessons to 2 friends this week.  They are <br/>
eager to start boxing and I think they'll be great.  And my sister <br/>
(Alley Cat) has started hunting - I just have to get her planting <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I'm planting in Mississippi, too.  I've done one in Jackson with <br/>
more to follow.  I'll plant 2 in Natchez tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter and her boyfriend found one of yours on the way from <br/>
Houston to BR last weekend!  And they surprised me by planting 2 <br/>
here, which I just found out about this weekend.  So that is half of <br/>
my finds...<br/>
<br/>
Louisiana and Mississippi are always last for everything... SIGH.<br/>
