<br/>
Enjoyed those responses to those letterboxing ideas I had.  Sometimes you<br/>
have to bounce around with different LB  thoughts to find out some<br/>
interesting insights. Here's another one. How about a "Gold Standard" for<br/>
checking LB's like once a year.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Jill &amp; I hiked up to the "Hotel" this afternoon and went into the<br/>
main dining room and checked out the tin can holding the "Note Pad'' &amp;<br/>
Pen &amp; Stamp (homemade)&amp; etc...  There have been fires in the fireplace<br/>
but the tin can protected the LB ok. NOONE  have signed in yet this year<br/>
so we put 4-12-05 in the book and re hide it.<br/>
<br/>
We then got off the mountain and got home and gave Bud some real doggy<br/>
treats. (O Roy's)  Perfect Day!<br/>
