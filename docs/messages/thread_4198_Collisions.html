<body>Hi All,
<p>It also might be a good idea to put a note
on the letterboxing/geocaching main web pages explaining the differences
between each hobby.  Although I am an old hand at letterboxing and
new to geocaching, I am amazed at the proximity of the boxes and the caches
- sometimes almost right on top of each other.
</p><p>Jay (or letterbox webmasters)  if you
think this suggestion might be helpful, would you add a note to the letterboxing
website?     Would you like me to contact Jeremy to
add it to the geocache site?
</p><p>Thanks,

to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I HAD NOT LIVED AT
ALL!
