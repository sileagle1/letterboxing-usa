you might enjoy.<br/>
You'll remember how to play it, but some guessing you'll employ.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in at Marsha's Cattails box, you can follow these <br/>
clues to Tic Tac Toe your way back home.<br/>
<br/>
Take leave of the 15th bolt and at the top follow the trail to the <br/>
left.  Stop to notice the sign pointing in the direction from which <br/>
you started the days hunt.<br/>
<br/>
At a compass bearing of 300 degrees lies a fallen tree.  Follow the <br/>
trunk to the NW end and at the base of the roots is TIC TAC TOE.<br/>
<br/>
Continue your trek in the direction of your starting point following <br/>
the orange/brown blazed trail.  Cross bridge and take fork to the <br/>
left, following the orange/brown blazes.  Cross two short wooden <br/>
footbridges and continue to a spot where the trail crosses a long <br/>
terraced staircase.  <br/>
<br/>
Stop here to finish your game of TIC TAC TOE.  <br/>
<br/>
For two X's...one O...Will you choose the right clues and direction <br/>
to go?<br/>
<br/>
1) Descend 6 steps...20 paces at 270 degrees beneath large trunk<br/>
2) Ascend 10 steps...20 paces at 315 degrees beneath large trunk<br/>
3) From right where you are...17 paces at 300 degrees beneath large <br/>
trunk.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  All compass bearings point you in the direction of the <br/>
trunks...you'll need to search for just the right spot beneath. Bark <br/>
and leaves and rocks were used to conceal the boxes.  Please rehide <br/>
well. There are no logs to stamp in at the X's and O box.  The boxes <br/>
contain the stamps necessary to complete your Tic Tac Toe stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Moderate...it took us much persistence to find Marsha's <br/>
#2 Cattails box...don't give up, it's a hike you'll enjoy.  Watch for <br/>
thorns and have a stick to poke into some of the hiding places.<br/>
<br/>
Time Required:  3 hours (for me with one child, two dogs)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and be careful!<br/>
