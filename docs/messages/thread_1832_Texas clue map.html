There are two of my letterboxes that didn't make it on there though. <br/>
One in the Central Texas area near Fredericksburg at Enchanted Rock <br/>
<http: enchantedrock="" enchantedrock.html="" luna.spaceports.com="" ~eoghan=""> <br/>
and one  in the Texas High Plains area near Amarillo in Palo Duro <br/>
Canyon <http: lighthouse.html="" luna.spaceports.com="" paloduro="" ~eoghan="">. <br/>
Also the link to "HOME" is broken on the tx.html page. It links to a <br/>
nonexistent OR page <http: index.html="" or="" www.letterboxing.org="">.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I missed out on the gathering, looks like there was quite a <br/>
turnout. At least I can associate names with faces even though I <br/>
wasn't there thanks to all the photos.<br/>

I agree completely. Texas looks great (as does Oregon)! This new <br/>
design has been in the offing for several months, and is primarily <br/>
the brainchild of Mitch Klink. The rest of the webmasters will be <br/>
converting to this format too, but it will doubtless take a while.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Mitch!<br/>
