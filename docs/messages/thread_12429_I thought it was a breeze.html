site to the new one.  I was getting ready to post a message on how <br/>
easy it was &amp; I saw Butterfly &amp; motofranz' posts :(  Butterfly, I <br/>
would be happy to help you learn to post your clues to the new web <br/>
site.  I thought it was kinda fun.  Almost as much fun as root <br/>
canal ... a, duh, a, I mean ... almost as much fun as hiking the <br/>
Seven Falls was yesterday.  If you need any help just give me a shout.<br/>

figuring out what county to put stuff in! Especially since I place a <br/>
lot of boxes in far away places. I had to do some searching to find <br/>
out the counties. I know the webmasters must have been annoyed with <br/>
me before, because I never included that info with my letterbox <br/>
clues!! <br/>
