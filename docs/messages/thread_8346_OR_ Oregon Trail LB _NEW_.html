This is a well-visited place, so please be discreet and sure to re-hide the box well. This is our first box, so we would love to hear from anyone who looks for it to let us know how the clues worked out. </div> <div> </div> <div><strong>To Letterbox: </strong>From parking lot, find the official end of the Oregon Trail, as designated by the U. S. Congress in 1978. From here, take your search south until you meet up with a cervus elaphus named Wapiti. Then go 72 steps at 230 degrees. Continue your journey downward to the spot adopted by Posy Pickers Garden Club. Once you've come to this spot, walk to a very large open area at 200 degrees. Look for the 'Idaho Oregon Trail Boss' carved in stone. If you're looking at the trail boss correctly, you should find a fence straight ahead. Follow this fence to the left until you see an old till in the distance on your left. Standing on the north side of the till, take five steps downhill. The letterbox is hidden under the short log.</div> <div> </div> <div><strong>NOTE: This is a double-sided stamp, so make sure to get both images!</strong></div> <div><br/><br/> </div></body></html>
