I went looking for the elusive Burntwood box today. It seems Don Quixote<br/>
did a pretty good job of hiding it.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone actually found this box? I did a pretty thorough search and<br/>
want to make sure it didnt get snatched by some hoodlums before I got a<br/>
chance to stamp in.<br/>

On further investigation I realized I had visited the giants of a land<br/>
similar to and not far away from Burntwood. Oops.<br/>
