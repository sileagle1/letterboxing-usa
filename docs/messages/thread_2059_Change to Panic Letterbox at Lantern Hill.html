the "Panic" letterbox should be avoided.  It is best to wait a couple <br/>
of weeks for the warm weather to melt all the snow and ice to make <br/>
sure that you can safely enjoy this beautiful but difficult scramble.<br/>

Jay, <br/>
Please substitute the following paragraph for the existing one <br/>
in "Panic" <br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  Clues easy, hike very difficult.  This is a scramble of <br/>
medium difficulty that can be attempted by most adults that are sure <br/>
footed.  It should only be done in dry conditions.  Rain, snow and <br/>
ice could put the hiker in a dangerous situation.  It offers a nice <br/>
challenge and rewarding views.  It is not a place for children and <br/>
pets.  Note, this box was planted in winter and may have to be hidden <br/>
better when the snow and ice are gone.<br/>
