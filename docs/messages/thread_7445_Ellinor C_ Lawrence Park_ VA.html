<div>Another fun after school LB adventure.  I love 
going to parks that we didn't even know existed!  There are so many in the 
Fairfax County area!  I can't wait to plant our box in one of our 
favorites!...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had a great time searching for the two 
boxes.  The directions were very clear and the staircase that went down and 
up and wound around was pretty cool.  We didn't see any wildlife outside 
this time.  I think we scared away every bird in this park reknown for its 
birds (a five and a seven year old can be pretty loud...).  We did, 
however, get to see a snake eat a baby mouse (in the nature center!).  The 
park rangers were very nice and the nature center had some nice 
exhibits.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The grass trails on the hunt for box #2 were wide 
and my daughter did not trip over every root she found (that was box number 
1...).  She came away with dirt on her knees, ink on her nose and a smile 
on her face!  Thanks!  BeMa</div>
