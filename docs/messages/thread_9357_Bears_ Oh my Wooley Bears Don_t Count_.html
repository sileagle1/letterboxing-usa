                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes there are a few bears around.  We have one that visits the barn <br/>
(3 or 4 miles away) on occasion.  I have no doubt that they have been <br/>
severely impacted by all the developement on the ridge.<br/>
<br/>
We had one visit the Bridle Trails SP once about 5 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I have encountered bears out in the Cascades and I consider them <br/>
fairly harmless.  They are so nearsighted.  I dont know, I guess I <br/>
hate the thought of any fears keeping me from the good things in life.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard enough to get on the freeway everyday.  If I really <br/>
thought about it I would not do it!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The possibility of a bear and any remote notion that they could harm <br/>
me won't keep me from doing what I care to do.  Actually I enjoy <br/>
seeing wildlife, but usually they are running away.<br/>
