am not averse to "public space"<br/>
it doesn't look to me that the group is large enough to start paying for<br/>
space (unless someone has a rich uncle). <br/>
It is apparent to me how much time, effort, and ability the webmasters<br/>
have put into the site.<br/>
anything that will continue the effort will still inspire people to<br/>
continue. I don't know how you all have the time and energy to put out so<br/>
many sites, but i'd have dropped the whole thing if i hadn't been able to<br/>
watch some success even if it was by email.-the baylb<br/>
