<br/>
I've got a few more little graphic goodies I was hoping you all would take a<br/>
look at and tell us what you think.  I posted them on the same misc. picture<br/>
page I've been using in the past.  To see them, go to the Kids Corner page and<br/>
click on Piglet.<br/>
<br/>
The first new picture you will notice is the "Letter-FOX".  This is an<br/>
original piece of art created by my fellow letterboxing Oregonian, Thom<br/>
Cheney.  He has volunteered to help us with the graphics for Kids Corner.<br/>
This is a sample of what he has in mind.  I think it looks very promising.<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom of the page I posted a map.  I kind of liked this map and was<br/>
thinking it might be preferable to the gray map we are currently using on the<br/>
main "Letterbox USA" page.  It's attractive, and looks good with Dan's current<br/>
color scheme.  More importantly, it has the state abbreviations on it, which<br/>
makes it a little more user-friendly for younger clue-seekers who may not have<br/>
the map of states committed to memory.  Another benefit is that it is much<br/>
easier to click on the small states, like Rhode Island &amp; Deleware.  These<br/>
states have the abbreviation located on a leader line.  You can either click<br/>
inside the state boundary, or on the abbreviation (or the leader line, for<br/>
that matter) to select the state.<br/>
<br/>
My theory was that we might consider simplifying the main page somewhat.  I'm<br/>
thinking the map of "State Contacts" might be more appropriate on the "Group<br/>
Mail" page.  That would just leave the Clues Map and the Weather Maps on the<br/>
main page.  To see a working model of this concept, go back to Kids Corner and<br/>
click on the Owl.<br/>
<br/>
Any comments?<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

did you already mention somewhere what the different colors mean? I assume the<br/>
gray states have no boxes... then there was Tennessee in white, and a few in<br/>
aqua, and some in red.... sorry if I missed this along the way. My guess is it<br/>
pertains to how many boxes are placed...???<br/>
