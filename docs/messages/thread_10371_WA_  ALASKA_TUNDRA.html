Traveler letterboxes, John and I set out for a lovely Sunday drive on<br/>
the Washington side of the Gorge.  <br/>
<br/>
She is absolutely right.  These are wonderful letterboxes.  If you are<br/>
expecting to go hiking, though, dream on, or seek other LB's.  Alaska<br/>
Bound is a very short walk and Tundra Traveler is definitely drive-by<br/>
quality with a very clever Funhog hiding spot!  Excellent clues, too!<br/>
The man would have liked more exercise, but I have no complaints.  These<br/>
are terrific boxes in scenic places and we both agree the stamps are<br/>
lovely.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great reason to go for a nice drive with Mt. Hood staring<br/>
us in the face on a gorgeously sunny day.  Funhog placed Tundra and I<br/>
have a feeling that, although it is not her box, she did the honors for<br/>
the beautiful Alaska Bound.  If y'all want to know who carved this<br/>
beauty you'll have to achieve it to find out!!!  Worth going for!<br/>
Also...I love that cute little new Funhog word stamp.  HOW CREATIVE!!!<br/>
<br/>
It was a fun day.  I think I need to go for Ryan's Mt. Defiance box in<br/>
February, though, to do something about this accumulating flab.  Not<br/>
till after my cruise in a little more than a week on the SS Glutton,<br/>
though.  HA! HA!  I won't be a funhog.  I'll be a FOODhog on that<br/>
vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Don't despair! if you want exercise, head for the letterboxes at<br/>
Gillette Lake, Hamilton Mountain, Beacon Rock or Dog Mountain after<br/>
you get these super easy boxes. I visited the one at Gillette Lake the<br/>
day I placed those two boxes for that very reason. Thanks for the<br/>
kudos. See you further up the blacktop, Good Buddy...Funhog<br/>

Is that hike even doable in February with all the snow?  I've heard <br/>
Mt. Defiance doesn't get its name from being a tough hike (although <br/>
the north side certainly fits that bill!), but rather the persistent <br/>
snow that lingers until relatively late in the season!<br/>

I've always wanted to try snow shoeing, though.  I've never <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ditto that concern on the snow - I once read a story on the web <br/>
somewhere written about some guys who got lost in the snow on Mt. <br/>
Defiance. Not pretty. I'd wait until late spring for that one.<br/>
<br/>
Head out to the Banks-Vernonia linear trail. If you get all 11 boxes <br/>
without driving from trailhead to trailhead, you'd get a pretty good <br/>
workout. <br/>
