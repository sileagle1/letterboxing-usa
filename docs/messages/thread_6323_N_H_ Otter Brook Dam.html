dam. Drive past the park headquarters, past the dam and park in the area by the 
yellow gate.</p>

<p align="left">Clues:</p>
<p>Max found a little yellow ball in the grass by the parking lot. He dropped it 
by the yellow gate and chased it down the path. Although he really wanted to 
swim, he bypassed the fork down to the swimming hole and took the high road. He 
chased the ball down the dirt, but when the road changed back to asphalt, his 
paws got much too hot. He ran about 50 steps before he hopped off the path and 
ran up the hill into the woods. Max stopped to sniff a giant pine, then he saw a 
small mammal beneath the wide end of a rotting log (at 40 degrees) He went to 
check it out and was surprised at what he saw!</p></div></body></html>
