  I do understand mystery boxes and bonus boxes ("falling leaves" is <br/>
a series I've encountered now and again). Plus, the phrase "add-on" <br/>
makes sense to me.  The word unpublished threw me for a loop.  Thanks <br/>

There actually are unpublished boxes also. There is a<br/>
box planted near the "My favorite musicals" series in<br/>
Mansfield that has never been listed. The girl scouts<br/>
in have boxes in Pomfret that are not listed on the<br/>
LBNA site. Many CT <br/>

have boxes in Pomfret that are not listed on the LBNA<br/>

hole series and the Molly Day boxes are still there<br/>
but not listed on the site. Eastern Mountain Sports<br/>
has some boxes where you can only get the clues at<br/>
their Waterford store. I know of 1 case where one of<br/>
their boxes still exists but they never posted it and<br/>
have no copy of the clues themselves......Chuck and Molly<br/>

And which one would that be?  I have numerous clues from EMS here at the <br/>
house and would be able to replenish their supply if necessary.  E-mail me <br/>
privately if you know :-)<br/>

As far as unpublished boxes goes, there are alot of them out there. <br/>
It is all about WHO YOU KNOW! If you go to gatherings, sometimes <br/>
there are clues passed around that never make it to the LBNA Map. If <br/>
you are friendly with another letterboxer, they may let you in on <br/>
some unpublished boxes that they know about. Some boxes are in spots <br/>
where a high volume of traffic is not wanted...so the clues for them <br/>
are spread around to a select few people. <br/>
<br/>
Some boxes are placed for personal purposes. A birthday present to a <br/>
dear friend or an aniversary of an important family event. These are <br/>
private letterboxes that are only shared within a family or among a <br/>
close group of friends. <br/>

floating around in a few boxes to an unpublished cuckoo box I did. The<br/>
instructions on the little laminated cards that are the cuckoo clues<br/>
ask boxers to kindly leave the clue they've just found in the box that<br/>
they found it in or to move the clue to another Richmond-area box, but<br/>
I would rather not have the clues being planted in boxes outside the<br/>
Richmond area. It just seems easier on all involved.<br/>
