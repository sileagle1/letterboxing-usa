                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well my next door neighbor and I spent a wonderful morning/afternoon <br/>
letterboxing today. We went to Ft. Steilacoom Park where there are <br/>
over a dozen letterboxes hidden. THis is my third trip out there and <br/>
I still haven't found all of them. It was actually our second trip <br/>
out there this week. We went last Sunday in search of an elusive <br/>
Waughop...didn't find it though.  We did find three out of four <br/>
clowns though! But on to today's news.<br/>
<br/>
We started off in search of the SSLF Finish line box planeted by <br/>
Rayvenhaus last fall for the Sourth Sound Quest Fest. We found our <br/>
ablebodied runner in great shape. The box was a little damp inside <br/>
but all was well inside. We enjoyed the company of two beautiful <br/>
Golden Retreivers and their owners as they walked past us on the <br/>
trail. <br/>
<br/>
After that we made our second attempt at locating the elusive <br/>
Waughop!  Mind you we spent two hours trekking all over the park in <br/>
search of it this past Sunday. And I think I spent several nights <br/>
this week pondering the clues. Last night I realized that we missed <br/>
one part of the clue thinking it was a sidenote and in reality it was <br/>
the missing part of the puzzle. So...today we went back (without <br/>
kids) and took a second look and sure enough...that proved to be the <br/>
link!! 10 minutes later and after searching the wrong set of <br/>
guardians we found the elusive Waughop! And received a treat in the <br/>
process!!!<br/>
<br/>
Yep...residing with the elusive Waughop was the Marlene's Memory <br/>
Treaveling Angel HH! So we picked up the HH and plan on dropping it <br/>
off this coming week. It has made its way from Oregon via a couple of <br/>
dinosaurs, the Clakamas River, Milo's Bust then signed by Wingnut and <br/>
Rayvenhaus. Rayvenhaus left it at the elusive Waughop box on August <br/>
11th. We captured this elusive creature today and were blessed with <br/>
an angel. She will be delivered to a box somewhere in Pierce County <br/>
later this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
All in all we searched for seven boxes..found two and believe that <br/>
one box (Washington Territorial Insane Asylum) is MIA again. I know <br/>
that it was fine and well in November and put back in it's proper <br/>
place but came up MIA today.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great day for boxing and just as we were winding down a <br/>
gentle snow started falling. So we can officially say we boxed in the <br/>
snow. Actually there was snow on the ground still from the snow we <br/>
had two days ago when we started.<br/>

Great box...enjoyed the hunt for it.<br/>
