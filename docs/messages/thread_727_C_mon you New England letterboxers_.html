Hey yeah !...I'm with Nisa...It's gone real quiet after that convention...<br/>
<br/>
..er maybe they're lost in the hot tub ?  <lol><br/>
<br/>
Is this another Titanic..I wonder if there were enough lifeboats <big grin=""><br/>
<br/>
maybe the image of a " Lifeboat fulll of Letterboxers swirling in a hot<br/>
tub" might make a good stamp ....?<br/>

Maybe we all needed a day to recover, or to gently ease back into the<br/>
real world, or to get back down to PA as was my case...<br/>
<br/>
What a great rejuvenating weekend!  Such a pleasure to finally meet (as<br/>
Erik said) some long-time friends.  Tom, thanks again for having so<br/>
graciously given of yourself to make this happen.<br/>
<br/>
I do haven extremely cluttered desk staring at me with many nearing<br/>
deadlines, so I will keep note short.  More will follow.<br/>
<br/>
Erik &amp; Susan, thanks for hiding J. Taylor #1 (&amp;*^##*) and later J.<br/>
Taylor #2 in its more permanent resting place.  What a nice spot you've<br/>
found!  Now you'll need to head back up there to find the "1st E.C.<br/>
LBNA Gathering Memorial Box".  I'll post clues within the week (I'll<br/>
post Pocomoke too, Randy &amp; Kim)<br/>
<br/>
More to come...<br/>

X????  One of the things I enjoy most about this hobby is the ability<br/>
to both give (P) and take (F) as we place and find boxes.  Now I've<br/>
found a third dimension: meeting fellow letterboxers and exchanging (X)<br/>
personal stamps, among other things.<br/>

I agree!  One of the nicest parts of the weekend was gathering together <br/>
around a table in McGrath's Pub on Saturday night, listening to live Irish <br/>
music and downing pints of Guinness and other brews while we looked at each <br/>
other's stamp notebooks and collected impressions of each other's personal <br/>
stamps.  I like this new X category you've created, John!  We also stamped <br/>
our personal stamps together on a single piece of paper, which I think Rae <br/>
is going to scan and will let us know when it is online.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say, seeing John's and Randy's notebooks filled with so many stamp <br/>
impressions (Randy said he had found 75, but I think that number has since <br/>
gone up) was a real inspiration.  And I liked seeing how differently <br/>
everyone maintains their notebooks--some use black ink consistently, others <br/>
use a variety of colors, some note only the date the box was found, while <br/>
others write a brief description of the locale or the challenges of the <br/>
quest.  Some people are carving fairly large stamps, so we learned that very <br/>
small notebooks (only 3" wide) can't accommodate some of the larger stamps <br/>
being created.<br/>
<br/>
I was also glad that the person (whose name I've forgotten) involved with <br/>
Valley Quest dropped off copies of the Valley Quest clue book (containing <br/>
clues for 50+ boxes hidden by schoolchildren in Vermont and New Hampshire).  <br/>
I had a great time, on my drive back to Massachusetts, stopping in the town <br/>
of Woodstock and locating a couple of letterboxes hidden right in town.  <br/>
Until now I have associated letterboxing with hiking in out-of-the-way <br/>
locations, but the Woodstock boxes have inpsired me to start thinking about <br/>
where I might place some "in-town" boxes with clues kids can solve.<br/>
<br/>
I've already thanked Tom Cooch privately for his efforts in making this <br/>
get-together happen, but hey, why not thank him on the list too!<br/>
It was great fun.<br/>

<br/>
We got there late saturday afternoon and figured I had time to go up <br/>
on the Long Trail and look for Tom's two boxes, ran into more of <br/>
Tom's subtle cleverness on the first one and ran into John and Kim <br/>
and Erik up there also wandering around on the trail, and with a <br/>
little "comparing of notes" with John managed to find the box but<br/>
didn't have time to look for the second one before dark and dinner.<br/>
<br/>
Back at the inn Tom passed out the clues to a commerative box he <br/>
hid somewhere in the inn, and letterboxers were scouring the pub<br/>
for clues like detectives in a Victorian murder mystery trying <br/>
to be the first to find it.  That honor went to John, who must have<br/>
had fewer beers than everyone else :-) [clues to these boxes are at<br/>
http://www.sover.net/~tcooch/sherburne.htm]<br/>
<br/>
Gathered in the pub swapping stamps, books, and letterboxing <br/>
stories with everyone else, listening to the 4 piece Irish band <br/>
"Wind that Shakes the Barley" which featured bagpipes, accordion,<br/>
guitar, stories and ballads and a singer who reminded me somewhat<br/>
of Sandy Denny, and swapped more stories and stamps and books, and <br/>
as John said, we collected a sheet of the personal stamps of <br/>
everyone that was there.<br/>
<br/>
Next morning did a trail run in the snow up the long trail to <br/>
find Tom's other box, which featured a run through a beautiful birch <br/>
forest to a fine lookout point.  Back in time for breakfast to <br/>
discover that Susan had put together some clues for another box.  <br/>
Several letterboxers went on a "goose chase" puzzling over the <br/>
cryptic clues, chasing down countless bizarre hypotheses around <br/>
various parts outside the inn until Kim eventually found the box.<br/>
Susan and Erik, of course, were watching the antics of the hunt <br/>
from the comfort of the inn.<br/>
<br/>
Then we had to go.  What was really cool was meeting the folks in<br/>
the pub and exchanging stories, and watching several people hunt for<br/>
boxes at once.  We'll have to do these things again next year.  Rae<br/>
caught alot of it on video, including the two hunts, so I guess some<br/>
of it will show up on the web site some day.<br/>
<br/>
I thanked Tom privately and thank him again for putting the whole thing<br/>
together.  The downside of doing such a good job putting the whole <br/>
thing together is that he is nominated to do it next year :-)<br/>
