 I do miine like a journal - I put the stamp in the same place<br/>
on each page and describe the day, the scenery, my blisters or<br/>
anything else that comes to mind. I also describe for my own<br/>
reading pleasure 'a rating for the hike'. My ratings tell me how<br/>
tough the hiking was and how good the clues were. This helps me<br/>
the next time when the same "Author" tells me it's just a mile up<br/>
the road and it's really more like two. Some people have longer<br/>
legs than I do. ;-)<br/>

As you can imagine the Logbook is big so I don't bring it with me on the<br/>

&gt; My logbook is like a scrap book.  I indicate if I am planting or <br/>

copy of<br/>
&gt; the clues, pictures that I've taken on the trail, the letterbox <br/>
image, and<br/>

have a<br/>

I write<br/>

planted,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you can imagine the Logbook is big so I don't bring it with me <br/>
on the<br/>
&gt; hike.  I take blank paper with me or a very small sketch pad.  When <br/>
I get<br/>
&gt; home and the pictures are developed I cut everything out and paste <br/>
it into<br/>
&gt; the book.  Personally I think this is way too much effort.  But in <br/>
my<br/>
&gt; enthusiasm when I started letterboxing this is the system I started <br/>
and I'm<br/>
&gt; too lazy to change it.<br/>

&gt; My logbook is like a journal.  I glue the clues in, stamp, and then <br/>
write<br/>
&gt; the date and a little about the hike.  Interesting things we saw, or<br/>
&gt; anything at all about the hike.  A lot of times I take a picture <br/>
somewhere<br/>
&gt; along the hike and I also put that in my journal.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;After doing my first Letterboxing trip (Who Let The Dogs Out), I <br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt;wondering; what do you put in your personal log?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Do you just stamp?  Do you write notes? (what kind?) ... or do you <br/>
do<br/>
&gt; &gt;it more like a journal?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Just looking for ideas.  =)<br/>

&gt; &gt;(Heh, I was counting Who Let The Dogs Out as only one box... oops)<br/>
