Endangered Parks List <br/>
Mon Mar 25,11:34 AM ET <br/>
By The Associated Press <br/>
<br/>
The National Parks Conservation Association's annual list <br/>
of "America's 10 Most Endangered National Parks:"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
_Mojave National Preserve, California, where the desert's water could <br/>
be drained by development, illegal poaching threatens wildlife, and <br/>
off-road vehicles damage the habitat.<br/>
<br/>
_Ocmulgee National Monument, Georgia, where a proposed highway could <br/>
cut off the last undeveloped area from the park.<br/>
<br/>
_Valley Forge National Historical Park in Pennsylvania, where a <br/>
luxury home developer wants to build inside the park's boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
_Federal Hall National Monument, New York City, where there is a lack <br/>
of operating money to pay for rangers who can explain the site to <br/>
visitors, and a damaged building foundation.<br/>
<br/>
_Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska, where increased boat <br/>
traffic is creating more pollution and increases the threat of fuel <br/>
and oil spills.<br/>
<br/>
_Big Bend National Park, Texas, threatened by air pollution and <br/>
reduced water flow.<br/>
<br/>
_Glacier National Park, Montana, troubled by development near the <br/>
park's boundaries, crumbling roads and other infrastructure problems.<br/>
<br/>
_Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North Carolina, <br/>
where air pollution threatens more than 30 species of plant life.<br/>
<br/>
_Everglades, Biscayne Bay and Big Cypress parks, Florida, where water <br/>
levels and pollution continue to pose significant problems. All-<br/>
terrain vehicles also are damaging Big Cypress.<br/>
<br/>
_Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming and Montana, air pollution from <br/>
snowmobiles.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW! That's pretty interesting about Mojave National Preserve being <br/>
on the most endangered national parks list!  We didn't see a single <br/>
other person out there the whole time we were there hiking, except <br/>
for one other elderly couple on Teutonia Peak - and the place is <br/>
HUGE! We had the whole Kelso Dunes area to ourselves, the whole Hole-<br/>
in-the-Wall area,too, and just about everywhere else we went!  Guess <br/>
it must just depend on the time of day,week, or year. Quite different <br/>
from Death Valley, which is well-known to be crowded this time of year<br/>
(although even there we had several trails all to ourselves!) <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm certainly glad we got to see those places from <br/>
an "unspoiled aspect".  Sure hope that situation doesn't drastically <br/>
change.  The only problem we were even aware of was lack of <br/>
government funding - the ranger at the little outside-of-park visitor <br/>
center told us that Mojave was so underfunded that they couldn't even <br/>
afford to put out a park brochure yet, like the other parks have,  <br/>
and that renovating the old Kelso Depot(a beautiful Spanish colonial-<br/>
type building) for use as a visitor center would have to be years <br/>
away.  Had heard of some of those other parks having problems,though. <br/>
Hope they can be taken care of!!!<br/>
