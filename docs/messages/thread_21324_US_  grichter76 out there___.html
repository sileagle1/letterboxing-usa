Does anybody know this person or recognize this AOL account name?  I <br/>
have a HH this individual planted 3 years ago with instructions to <br/>
return it to them in Virginia once it reached the Pacific Ocean.  <br/>
Well, it touched the ocean last week and now we're trying to mail it <br/>
back to its owner.  Anybody have any idea who/where this individual <br/>
is???  We'd like to return this HH to the rightful owner before <br/>
we 'lose' it in the chaos of life!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks--dvn2r ckr<br/>

&gt; We attempted to write the planter of the "Oliver Tocamp, the <br/>
&gt; Hitchhiker Stamp" HH letterbox listed as "grichter76" (???) with <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; email address extension for further instructions but the provided <br/>
&gt; email bounced.  Anybody know the individual who planted this <br/>
&gt; letterbox back in 2002?  If so, please let them know we have their <br/>
&gt; HH and are awaiting further guidance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; Ironically, it looks like "Oliver Tocamp, the Hitchhiker Stamp"  <br/>
&gt; &gt; ended his westward journeys at the bad beginning lb on 26 Jan 05.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Launched from Virginia Beach, VA on 14 Apr 2002, his mission was <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; see the Pacific Ocean and boy did he get that opportunity these <br/>
&gt; past <br/>
&gt; &gt; few days.  We took him straight to the beach after rescuing him <br/>
&gt; from <br/>
&gt; &gt; a frightful spot today!  ;)  He'll be heading home soon...<br/>
