I recently went searching for Just Flyin' Through and Lock Ridge boxes in<br/>
the Allentown area.<br/>
I couldn't find either.<br/>
Pretty sure I followed the clues properly.<br/>

Can anyone comment regarding when they were last seen or if they have been<br/>

Thanks.<br/>

We found Lock Ridge in August 2002. We went the wrong way on the <br/>

Hey, if you ever get down towards Lansdale looking, check out Green Lane<br/>

Wouldn't mind hooking up for an exchange either.<br/>
Still don't have one, yet.<br/>

How close are those boxes to the turnpike exit (sounding like I'm <br/>
from Jersey).  We live in Delaware, but frequently travel to the <br/>
Lehigh Valley to visit family.<br/>

&gt; From the Lansdale exit of the Northeast extension, it is about 7-8 <br/>
miles to<br/>
&gt; Green Lane Park.<br/>
&gt; I have three boxes in the Park and then six more on the Trail which <br/>
starts<br/>
&gt; (or ends) in Green Lane.<br/>
&gt; They are scattered over the 22 mile trail, so it may not be that <br/>
easy to<br/>

&gt; Might be possible with some careful mapping or GPS homework.<br/>
