<br/>
Good News:  The Alphabet Bandits have place two more boxes today, "O" in the Alphabet Series and "Harry Potter" in the I love to read series in Garrison, NY<br/>
<br/>
Bad News: Just as the second box was planted, we realized at the exact moment the heavens opened up and it began to POUR that we had the stamps mixed up... the log books are in the right boxes, but the stamps were switched by mistake. <br/>
<br/>
We hope to get back there this weekend to goof, but if you beat us to it, feel free to make the switch... that means you'll visit one box twice, but its a really nice walk!<br/>
