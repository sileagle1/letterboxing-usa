<p align="left">     This is a series of letterboxes in the coastal area of Southeastern Massachusetts.  Prior <br/>     to the placement of these boxes, there were hardly any remaining letterboxes in this part <br/>     of the state, since a number of letterboxes placed by Lonemass Wolf and You Inspire My <br/>     Spirit have gone missing.  Since this is truly a scenic part of Massachusetts, we are <br/>     trying to place some boxes in particularly scenic areas to tempt local letterboxers.  We <br/>     envision this as a growing series, so will call these first four boxes "Series One".  All <br/>     boxes in this series can be considered "drive-by", since they are very close to parking <br/>     lots.  As such they are appropriate for parties with young children.  The entire loop <br/>     could also be reached by bicycle;  the best place to park to bike the loop would be the <br/>     commuter parking lot to the south of Route 195 at exit 19B.  From here through <br/>     Mattapoisett, to Marion, and back will be on the order of 20 miles, depending on the <br/>     exact route you take.  Many excellent food stops can be found along the way, but we <br/>     recommend:</p>
<p align="left">             Uncle Jon's Coffee (across from the commuter parking lot in <br/>             Mattapoisett, and also along Rte 6 in Marion)</p>
<p align="left">             The Mattapoisett Chowder House (south of Rte 6 in Mattapoisett)</p>
<p align="left">             Cerulli's (breakfast and lunch) at the Ropewalk (north of Rte 6 in <br/>             Mattapoisett)</p>
<p align="left">             Nick's Pizza  (north of Rte 6 in Mattapoisett)</p>
<p align="left">             Turk's Seafood (north of Rte 6 and east of Mattapoisett center)</p>
<p align="left">             Oxford Creamery (south of Rte 6 and east of Mattapoisett center)</p>
<p align="left">             The Sugar Shack (and Hardware Cafe) on corner of Rte 6 and <br/>             Spring St in Marion)</p>
<p align="left"><br/>                     SEASIDE LETTERBOXES -- SERIES ONE</p>
<p align="left"> 1.     Dunseith Gardens</p>
<p align="left">     This letterbox is placed on Mattapoisett Land Trust property near the center of the Town <br/>     of Mattapoisett.  The land was originally owned by Henry Dunseith, who was a model <br/>     railway aficionado and owner of a home-based gift shop that dominated this particular <br/>     corner of Route 6 before Interstate 195 was built.  The gift shop was marked by a 38 <br/>     foot statue of a marine vertebrate, which became a Mattapoisett landmark from the <br/>     1950's on.  Long after Rte 195 had "bypassed" this part of Route 6, and long after the gift <br/>     shop closed its doors, the statue remained .  Henry Dunseith died in 1988, and <br/>     bequeathed the property to the land trust.  In 1991, the animal was given a new paint job <br/>     and wiring.  After some discussion about what to do with this unique landmark, the land <br/>     trust decided that it could stay where it is.  The land on which Henry Dunseith's house <br/>     stood, however, has been converted into gardens.  A small nature trail has been <br/>     constructed as an project by a local eagle scout.  It is really quite a unique place. </p>
<p align="left">     The entrance to the property is off Route 6 West, just after passing the Salvation Army <br/>     Thrift Store, and the gardens occupy the corner of North St and Route 6.  Enter and park <br/>     your car.  I won't spoil your fun by telling you "what animal" the statue represents, or <br/>     otherwise describing all the details of this property because it is quite unusual.  After <br/>     parking, find your way to the nautical buoy.  With your back to the buoy, site 60 degrees <br/>     to a very large pine tree that is about 29 paces from you.  Walk to that tree, and with <br/>     your back to its trunk, site 0 (360) degrees to a large ash tree.  Walk to that tree.  After <br/>     passing the tree, you will see the entrance to a nature trail.  Enter the trail, and turn right.  <br/>     Proceed 42 paces where you will see a small monument on your right that marks the <br/>     grave of a beautiful collie named "Sandy".  Continue down the trail (past an exit to your <br/>     right).  Where the trail curves to the right, there will be a red cedar immediately in front <br/>     of you.  Put your back to that tree, and site 20 degrees to a wall.  Your treasure lies <br/>     behind the wall under some boulders to your left if you walk to the wall in the direction <br/>     of your site.</p>
<p align="left">     Before leaving Dunseith Gardens, take a look at some of the other features of the <br/>     landscape, include a ring of stones (for storytelling?) that ressembles Stonehenge!</p>
<p align="left"> 2.   Island Wharf</p>
<p align="left"><br/>     Island Wharf is situated on Front Street in the middle of the Town of Marion.  Take <br/>     Route 105 South (Front St).  Cross Route 6 at the traffic light.  Continue on for about 1 <br/>     mile, passing parts of Taber Academy on your right and left.  Island Wharf is on your left <br/>     across from the old Taber Music Hall.  The Island Wharf area serves as a parking lot for <br/>     the town docks, and for Barden's Boat Yard.  Enter and park on your left in the dirt <br/>     parking lot.  Anyone can park here by day, but overnight parking requires a resident <br/>     sticker.  The Marion Band Shell is also located here, and is the site of free concerts on <br/>     Monday evenings at 7:30 pm in the summer months. </p>
<p align="left">     The Island Wharf letterbox can be found by crossing the large lawn from the parking lot <br/>     towards the band shell (north).  Proceed to the back of the lawn where it joins someone's <br/>     private house lot at a wall that is partially cemented.  Turn towards Front street and <br/>     follow the edge of the wall past an area immediately adjacent to the neighbors' garden.  <br/>     At the end of this stretch,  just at the edge of a large deciduous shrub, you will find your <br/>     treasure under a large loose boulder on the south side of the wall.</p>
<p align="left"> 3.   Silvershell Beach</p>
<p align="left"><br/>     Silvershell Beach is the town beach for residents of both Marion and nearby Rochester.  <br/>     This situation developed because 150 years ago in 1852, Marion split off from <br/>     Rochester to form a separate town.  Rochester residents' rights to use the beach on <br/>     Buzzards Bay stem from that time. </p>
<p align="left">     In the summer, you will need a resident sticker to park at Silvershell during the hours of <br/>     8 - 5. After hours, or during the off season you may park at the beach.  Alternatively you <br/>     can bike or walk to the beach from parking at Island Wharf or elsewhere in town.  The <br/>     Beach can be found by continuing down Front St from Island Wharf until you reach <br/>     Sippican harbor.  A truly spectacular site awaits you there.  The views onto Sippican <br/>     harbor and Buzzards Bay are quite scenic.  You can see Bird Island lighthouse at the <br/>     entrance to the harbor, and Cleveland Ledge light, which marks the entrance to <br/>     Cleveland Ledge channel (a ship's channel leading towards the Cape Cod canal) in the <br/>     distance.  North Falmouth is situated across the Bay from Marion, and may also be <br/>     visible on a clear day. </p>
<p align="left">     After parking in the dirt lot, find the sign that tells the tale of Sprague's Cove Stormwater <br/>     Wetland System, an artificial wetlands that was built to try to purify the runoff in this <br/>     cove. The wetlands is full of birds on a spring or summer evening.  The sign that <br/>     describes the formation of this wetland system makes interesting reading.  After reading <br/>     the sign, you might want to walk to the foot of the beach and look at the salt marsh at its <br/>     southern edge. </p>
<p align="left">     The Town Beach has a pavilion and an adjacent playground at the northern end of the <br/>     property.  The grassy area to the west of the pavilion is full of people on any 4th of July <br/>     evening, watching spectacular fireworks over Sippican Harbor.  To find the Silvershell <br/>     Beach letterbox, follow the wooden fence north from the parking lot along the grassy <br/>     sward.  Continue to the northwestern corner of the property that abuts Lewis St.  Your <br/>     treasure lies under the southern end of the wall, just a little bit to the left of a chunk of <br/>     black asphalt that juts from the wall.  Take care in this area, as private houses are <br/>     immediately across the street from the hidden spot.</p>
<p align="left">     4.  "Walk Softly":</p>
<p align="left">     As the name implies, you will want to walk softly, or tread lightly in the area where this <br/>     letterbox is placed.  It is in a section of town where wealth is apparent, and privacy is a <br/>     high priority.  To reach the site from Silvershell Beach, travel back up Front Street to <br/>     Route 6.  Turn right (headed east) onto Route 6, and travel a mile or 2 to the intersection <br/>     with Point Rd.  Turn right on Point Road, and proceed for several miles.  Notice that <br/>     many of the roads off Point Rd are "Private Roads".  At the end of many of these roads <br/>     are large mansions with spectacular water views.  After passing the entrance to Piney Pt <br/>     on your left (marked by stone pillars), watch for the Planting Isle road on your right.  <br/>     Turn right onto this road, and proceed down to the rocky beach.  Park in the first small <br/>     cutout parking lot on your right.  Although a sign marking the lot states that resident only <br/>     stickers are required, you will not be bothered if you go early in the morning (before 9 <br/>     AM) or after 5 PM in the afternoon in the summer, or anytime during the offseason <br/>     (Labor Day to Memorial Day).  Walk back up the road the way you came until you reach <br/>     the second electric pole on your right.  At this point Bird Island lighthouse is visible <br/>     directly to the south.  Turn around and look towards the northeast, and you will see a <br/>     rather large red cedar tree standing about 35 paces off the road.  Your treasure likes <br/>     under a rock behind this tree.  From the "correct" red cedar , Bird Island light is 160 <br/>     degrees, and the aforementioned pole is 190 degrees.  There are several ways to safely <br/>     reach the tree, but be careful --- a few of them are rocky and bare while others track <br/>     through poison ivy patches. </p>
<p align="left">     After stamping in, enjoy the views from the beach.  Do not proceed farther down <br/>     Planting Isle Rd, as it is private property sometimes patrolled by a private security <br/>     guard who will ask who you want to visit.  After leaving Planting Island, you may want <br/>     to drive (or bicycle) farther down Point Rd to see some nice "houses" and spectacular <br/>     scenery.  The road ends at the Kittansett Country Club (private) which is at Butler Point.  <br/>     On your way back, you may want to take the Delano Rd loop, which will take you past <br/>     the Stone estate, a very nicely landscaped property. </p>
<p align="left">     Hope you enjoyed your venture through Mattapoisett and Marion!</p>
