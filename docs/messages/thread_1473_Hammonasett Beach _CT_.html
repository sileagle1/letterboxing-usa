We've recieved a spate of missing-box report on our Hammonasett Beach <br/>
letterbox, but this was by far the strangest:<br/>

My daughter and I visited your Hammonassett letterbox this morning (4 <br/>
Nov 00) at around 11:00, and found only a Chinese restaurant fortune <br/>
cookie.  We are 99% sure we were in the correct location (split rock <br/>
left of trail), and the cookie (still wrapped in its original <br/>
cellophane) was hidden beneath two covering stones.  Thought you <br/>
might want to know, if you didn't already.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
So, we went out in today's glorious clear weather to replace/revise <br/>
it. If you head out that way, please print the new cluesheet:<br/>

<br/>
And, SCowey, we're dying to know what the fortune said!<br/>
