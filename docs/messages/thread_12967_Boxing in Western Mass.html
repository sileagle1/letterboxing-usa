<br/>
Spring semester is just barely over, and we're out of<br/>
the gate already! We've been chomping at the bit for<br/>
the last two months, eager to get out on day long<br/>
boxing trips again.<br/>
<br/>
First stop was Poet's Seat Tower in Greenfield. The<br/>
last box is definitely gone. The clues led perfectly<br/>
to the tree, and we found the remains of the bark that<br/>
had concealed the box. The email of the planter is<br/>
chopped off on the site, and a search of the archive<br/>
proved fruitless, so if anyone knows who planted these<br/>
boxes, please let us know. <br/>
<br/>
Apparantly, someone had visited this series in the<br/>
middle of April, and implied that they were leaving a<br/>
surprise at box number three. If the third box is<br/>
gone, so is that gift. Major bummer. :-(<br/>
<br/>
We visited Captain Tupperware, and Pig Pen Ledges as<br/>
well. We were the first folks at both of these in a<br/>
long time. Everything ok at both. Pig Pen was<br/>
definitely worth the trip. Just missed another HH<br/>
there, too. Pink Ribbon HH was there as of 5/17. <br/>
<br/>
That kind of day.....<br/>
