afternoon to find the add on box.  We snowshoed up where we could, much of<br/>
the rock was exposed and easy to climb.  When we found the box it was frozen<br/>
in!  We couldn't get the box out, but we did manage to get the cover off<br/>
after much wrestling!  It was a close one, but I refused to leave without<br/>
the stamp despite how dark it was getting outside.  So far the only other<br/>
visitor has been Bob the RI Wiz.  Can't wait for the weekend, I am in<br/>
Letterbox withdrawel!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first time up there for me, there was a pretty good snow cover. I <br/>
spent quite a bit of time searching out the first box in the snow and <br/>
was about to give up on it (I hate giving up, too)when I just <br/>
stumbled upon it, for lack of a better word. That gave me hopes of <br/>
finding the second box, so I continued on. Thinking for sure that I <br/>
was in the right spot, I searched and kicked around in the snow for <br/>
another bit of time before realizing that Jay would never leave a box <br/>
in such a place compromising the saftey of the searchers. In my haste <br/>
to find the box, with out realizing it, I got myself into some tricky <br/>
footing. Thinking to myself that if anyone else came down the trail <br/>
I'd look to them quite the fool, I packed up and went home. Thirty <br/>
eight miles back home, without making my intended find.. First time <br/>
ever not making the find, unless the particular box was missing, and <br/>
that only occured once.<br/>
<br/>
Next weekend it warmed up and I headed back. This time it was very <br/>
foggy, and windy. I couldn't see the Casino from atop the hill, or <br/>
anything else for that matter. I was able to see the side trails a <br/>
little better, with most of the snow now being gone, and had no <br/>
trouble finding the second box. I made up my mind then and there that <br/>
letterboxing in the snow wasn't the thing to do and decided I'd do it <br/>
only when the ground was bare. YEAH, RIGHT. Since then I've done <br/>
the "Little Dam" series successfully, finding all four boxes, but <br/>
practically tearing down the last stone wall to do so, and just last <br/>
weekend, I tackled the "Feathers in your Cap" series. That one wasn't <br/>
so successful. I captured three of the four before figuring I was <br/>
tired and maybe made a wrong turn somewhere, and when I came upon a <br/>
trail I was familiar with, I headed home. I guess I'll have to get <br/>
back there for that fourth feather soon.<br/>
<br/>
Seeya all on the snowy trails,<br/>
