Gertie LB--if it weren't for a suave and daring TnE LB rescue at a <br/>
time during which I was unable to break away from work--this <br/>
letterbox would have definitely suffered the same fate as a dozen or <br/>
so cars and a poor little dog who now lie deep in the bowels of the <br/>
Tacoma Narrows.  It now resides in a location a couple miles away <br/>
that offers a great view of the bridge!<br/>
<br/>
As for other letterboxes, I've mostly had problems with vandals of <br/>
the 2-legged type totally obliterating old stumps or natural little <br/>
niches in which I'd hidden letterboxes--destroying the letterboxes <br/>
in the process. :(<br/>
