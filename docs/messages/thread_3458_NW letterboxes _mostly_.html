Especially when the participants in your contest did not willing <br/>

<br/>
There is certainly more to the total letterbox experience than just <br/>
collecting "worthy" art, though if you wish to ignore the beauty or <br/>
history of the site, or that some people enjoy carving even if they <br/>
aren't Leonardos with Linocutters, and others of us appreciate finding <br/>
and stamping primitive style stamps, well then that's up to you.<br/>
<br/>
I don't care to see were on your value scale you'd put my work. This <br/>
is one address I'll skip bookmarking.<br/>

<br/>
Don't get in an uproar about Ryan rating stamps in letterboxes.  The<br/>
letterboxes he is rating are his own that he has placed himself.  He's<br/>
not rating anyone else's art, so I don't think you have to worry.<br/>
<br/>
I have gotten a couple of his letterboxes out here in Oregon and, if<br/>
anything, the man underestimates his own talent (although he does say<br/>
there is an ugly eyeball hitchhiker out there that he thinks isn't much<br/>
of a carve).  The ones I've seen of his African Safari series in the<br/>
Columbia River Gorge are beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
So before everyone starts flaming Ryan like a weenie roast, please<br/>
realize it is HIS OWN opinion about HIS OWN stamps in HIS OWN<br/>
letterboxes.  I think he has the right to rate them if he so chooses<br/>
since he placed the boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the support, Amanda.  Sorry for the confusion, but yes, <br/>
all of the stamps are of my OWN creation that I've hidden myself.<br/>
<br/>
As for the ugly eyeball hitchhiker I created, did you notice it's the <br/>
ONLY stamp to get just a half star?  That's on a scale of 1 to 3 <br/>
stars!  =)  I'm not ashamed to admit I'm not proud of all my work, <br/>
but it doesn't stop me from hiding them.  However, I thought people <br/>
would like to know the quality of the stamp to expect.  Or at least <br/>
my opinion of them.  They are just one man's opinions, though, so <br/>
take the rankings with a grain of salt.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

On a related topic, I think I've come across (on a website long ago) <br/>
a group which sends each other postcards of their stamp art. One way <br/>
to share outside of Lb with like-minded enthusiasts.<br/>
