putting this thing together.  Can you spell MAJOR SUCCESS!  What a great<br/>
day!  And thanks for getting it together with the higher power for<br/>
perfect autumn weather and crispy fallen leaves to kick around and jump<br/>
in!  You could tell all the great Nail boys were loving it along with<br/>
Bethany's daughter Regan and DZ!  Ryan's event stamp is incredible.<br/>
This was the biggest West Coast letterboxing gig yet.  Hats off to you,<br/>
Bethany!  Not only that, but thanks to everyone who placed stamps up<br/>
there.  We will be coming back up there (maybe next month) to try and<br/>
get bunches more letterboxes.  We found the Letterboxr Fever Hitchhiker<br/>
of Fudrick's by the Old Insane Asylum.  Perfectly fitting since we were<br/>
definitely delirious!  It was contagious!  <br/>
<br/>
There can be no doubt that this deal was nothing less than a blow-out of<br/>
FUN!  I can't believe how I finally got to meet so many of the folks<br/>
I've written to and been hearing about up in the Seattle area along with<br/>
the favorites I already know and love!!  I am pleased and honored to<br/>
have gotten to spend the day with all of you.  I think I got 25<br/>
exchanges.  Do the Secret Gardners count as two even though they share a<br/>
stamp?  I didn't get Lisa's newly-carved masterpiece, either, but I'm<br/>
still counting her!   <br/>
<br/>
Lest it not be known by now...Bill Burk is NOT evil.  I will say it<br/>
again and again.  I have another opinion of Glenn, but let's not go<br/>
there.  AND...he WAS there!  Somewhere.  I suspsect he was the stocky<br/>
(or is that stalky?) guy with the mustache and the grey sweats who was<br/>
lukring around and seemed to be all over the place where letterboxers<br/>
were.  Anyway, a belated how do you do to Glenn, even!  <br/>
<br/>
John and I really had a great time.  The letterboxes we did find and the<br/>
food we ate (leave it to the chow hound orca to mention the great food!)<br/>
were wonderful.  Thanks everyone for coming.  Special thanks to<br/>
Flutterby (again) and the duo K-Martha's.  Even though we were deprived<br/>
of Legerdemaine's pumpkin cookies, Lizard came through with some<br/>
incredible apricot, nut and raisin concoctions of her own that, dare I<br/>
say...rival the great ones!  It was a really special, beautiful day.  <br/>
<br/>
Great job, Bethany!!!  Thanks for the effort in putting this thing<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
