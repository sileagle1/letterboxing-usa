We left a hitchhiker in your box (I believe it was Beaver-ish <br/>
Ambition but it could have been Sitting Duck) in July.<br/>
<br/>
Someone e-mailed me that they picked it up several weeks or more <br/>
later but it's not been heard from again.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that the next time you checked these boxes you could <br/>
check for me and see who picked it up.  I'm just wondering if it is <br/>
lost or something. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
