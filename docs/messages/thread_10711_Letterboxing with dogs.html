                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a great idea!  We have a 10 week-old golden retriever puppy that<br/>
will be going on many hikes with us.  It had not occurred to us to<br/>
make him part of the search team!<br/>
<br/>
How about this variation:  Those of us with dogs could plant boxes for<br/>
just that purpose--leave off the last clue so that people CAN'T find<br/>
it without their dogs.  Perhaps dog-owning letterboxers could agree on<br/>
a commercially marketed air freshener to spray on the inside of their<br/>
boxes.  Otherwise, all the different box types would have different<br/>
scents, each of which must be taught to the dogs.  Either that, or we<br/>
would all have to agree on the particular brand of container used as<br/>
the letterbox as each plastics company has a slightly different<br/>
formula, and thus, scent.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to hear more input about this great idea.  Thanks<br/>

LOL -- What an interesting idea ---  I never thought of purposely <br/>
leaving off part of the clues  (Egad, I have enough trouble finding <br/>
the letterboxes with all the clues !!  LOL.)<br/>
<br/>
I am going to work with Katie, my Black Lab, learning to find a <br/>
rubbermaid container &amp; let you know how I make out.  OBTW, Katie is <br/>
almost 12 years old, so once I teach her I better figure out how to <br/>
teach Sky or Indy (the two 2 year olds.) Katie is pretty smart.  <br/>
Since she already knows "find it" I'll bet she can learn this in an <br/>
afternoon.  Now the other two, maybe if I start now while they are 2 <br/>
years old they will learn it by the time they are 12!!! LOL <br/>
