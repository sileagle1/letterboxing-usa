Often when I find a box in a very public place, I will comment that "this<br/>
box is not long for the world". I think the trick is finding a spot that is<br/>
not quite so appealing to visitation.<br/>
<br/>
Here in New England the many stone walls and glacial boulder fields are<br/>
often hiding spots, but people just pick spots that are too interesting and<br/>
well visited by general hikers, picnickers etc. The placer loves the spot<br/>
and is determined to place a box there. They forget to factor in that<br/>
everyone ELSE also loves the area.<br/>
<br/>
When I look at a spot I alway think, "If I was five years old, would I want<br/>
to climb these rocks? Would my parents let me?" AND "If I was a teenager,<br/>
would this be the type of spot for late-night partying?" If so, it is very<br/>
likely that the box will be "happened upon" by non-boxers.<br/>
<br/>
If the box is in a spot where it is difficult to retrieve or replace without<br/>
being seen, then it's probably not a great spot. There is a box in Boston<br/>
that I had the darndest time visiting because people could see you from all<br/>
directions AND it was in one of the most highly visited tourist spots in the<br/>
city!!! This was not a well-placed box!<br/>
<br/>
As for areas with "bad reputations", I would generally think it's not a good<br/>
idea to be lingering around in high crime areas no matter what...especially<br/>
in a sport that involves families.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, it's all a matter of paying attention to the spot and its<br/>
normal everyday traffic. If you can forsee night time visitors (partiers or<br/>
homeless people) using the spot or if you cannot visit the spot without a<br/>
good 10 minutes or so lag time between people passing by, you might want to<br/>
think carefully about planting in the spot. If you are likely to be observed<br/>
by others acting "suspiciously", then consider the liklihood of having those<br/>
people call the police, and they show up to question you about your activity<br/>
(just ask Warrior Woman!!).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, library boxes are a different story, but then again I wouldn't<br/>
place one in the New York Times Periodicals either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's a lot of rambling on my part, but as with all things it's<br/>
about paying attention and using common sense.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

We placed our first letterbox a few weeks ago in Madison WI even though we<br/>
had heard that we'd be taking our chances as far as thieves and<br/>
vandalism...well....we are without our first box...sad to say...it was<br/>
stolen before it even got started.  Maybe we placed it in an area that was<br/>
too public...maybe our clues were too easy...who knows.  Any good ideas for<br/>
placing boxes in an area with a "bad" reputation?  MadCats<br/>
