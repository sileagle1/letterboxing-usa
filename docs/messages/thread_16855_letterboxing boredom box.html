and so forth.  And here in the west, going to another state isn't as <br/>
easy a fate as it is for easterners.  Yes, some of us have to travel <br/>
far and wide, but it is steadily growing.  Just keep planting, they <br/>
will come.  When I started here, I had to go hundreds of miles to <br/>
get more than the two boxes that were in my area.  There are <br/>
quite a few more now.<br/>

&gt; county I live in, plus in all the counties that touch my county.  <br/>
&gt; I've letterboxed in cities I've visited.  Now I find myself planning <br/>
&gt; all-day trips to counties that touch counties that touch my <br/>
county.  <br/>
&gt; I'm planning longer and longer travel times to the cities that I <br/>
&gt; visit just so I can letterbox along the way.  I'm going to a party <br/>
&gt; this evening in Pittsburgh (roughly 200 miles) being held by an <br/>
old <br/>
&gt; friend.  I'll be leaving before noon today.  Why?  Because I've <br/>
&gt; already found all the boxes in the vicinity of Pittsburgh, so now <br/>
I'm <br/>
&gt; going to be letterboxing all the way there?  Is there anybody <br/>
else <br/>
&gt; who does this sort of thing?<br/>
