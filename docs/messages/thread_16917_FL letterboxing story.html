The story:<br/>
<br/>
"I can not believe what I ran into this weekend while<br/>
checking up on my boxes.<br/>
I rode my bike out to Wetlands. Apparently, a homeless person named<br/>
"Birdman" found the box.<br/>
Birdman broke my stamp in two and continued to use the tablet as a diary<br/>
writing and stamping in it every day (with my stamp)! I took the box with me<br/>
and found a new home for it on the Mudflat trail. Had to rewrite the clues<br/>
and carve another stamp-same design. I'm pretty sure this new spot is safe<br/>
from the "Birdman". Of course, I got an e-mail this morning from a<br/>
letterboxer who went out there and couldn't find it. Bad timing.<br/>
<br/>
Birdman wrote: "I am homeless, out of work, uneployed [he can't spell] but<br/>
I'm gonna keep on keeping on because I'm an extreme survivor, biker, rider".<br/>
Then he stamped two full pages in the book with my broken stamp, then took a<br/>
pencil "dipped" it in the stamp pad, drew a picture of a pencil and the<br/>
date. Had to rip those pages out, too messy.<br/>
I kept the first page so have a look see if you find the box again."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess we can be grateful he at least stamped in and left a message! <g><br/>

humanity in this! It's too bad about the stamp but what a yarn to <br/>
tell for years to come! A creative person might even be inspired to <br/>
create a "Birdman" letterbox in memoriam...<br/>
<br/>
ROFL<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, great tale! :)<br/>
