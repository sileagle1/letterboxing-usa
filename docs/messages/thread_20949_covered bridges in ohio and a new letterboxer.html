Hello fellow Letterboxers,<br/>
<br/>
My name is sinna, and I am very new to this hobby, I found it on the internet <br/>
while I was recouperating from minor surgery three weeks ago. I have since <br/>
found 13 boxes in Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
I am a traveling nurse, so it will give me alot of different states to search <br/>
in as I go all over the usa. my assignment here ends jan 7th, looking forward <br/>
to finding more in WARMER states, til summer LOL<br/>
<br/>
I have a passion for covered bridges, so I plan on asking for an assignment <br/>
in Ohio to find the covered bridges boxes. I get a great hike, beautiful <br/>
pictures of bridges, and wonderful stamping fun.<br/>
<br/>
I am absolutely addicted to this, and loving every minute of it. I have also <br/>
gotten two friends into it... and one of my son's and his family. who is <br/>
currently making me a hand carved walking stick.<br/>
<br/>
I sure wish I had found this when i was in my 20's <br/>
<br/>
any recommendations for me to travel to in the future would be great.<br/>
<br/>

There is a covered bridge letterbox in Lancaster, PA. There are 28 covered bridges in Lancaster, PA and many more throughout PA. <br/>

There are several covered bridges in Oregon and Washington as well--<br/>
a few of them have (or had) letterboxes, too.  I placed a very <br/>
primitive letterbox at the last covered bridge upon which cars can <br/>
still drive here in Washington a while back (I definitely wouldn't <br/>
plan an entire trip around visiting this particular letterbox though <br/>
as the stamp is really AWFUL!!!--the bridge might make up for this <br/>
iniquity, though).  We also visited 2 of 3 covered bridges in SW <br/>
Oregon--as part of a letterbox series a couple of years ago.  <br/>
Unfortunately, one of those bridges tragically collapsed a few <br/>
months thereafter and then another letterbox in that series went <br/>
missing and to the best of my knowledge was never replaced.  Maybe <br/>
somebody will get inspired by your post and perhaps rejuvenate that <br/>
series?  ;)<br/>

Hope this helps you plan your future world travels!<br/>

Hello,<br/>
I live just north of the Lancaster County Covered Bridge letterbox<br/>
area and we did this box a few weeks ago.  I just wanted to mention<br/>
that it is almost a drive by letterbox but the trip to get to it takes<br/>
you driving through almost 60 miles of beautiful Amish country and<br/>
puts you in contact with 6 covered bridges.  There are several other<br/>
historical type letterboxes in the Lancaster area and the trip to our<br/>
part of the country is well worth the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to visit this area, please let me know and we can<br/>
arrange a stamp exchange,<br/>
Jan of Team Little Dog<br/>

There are covered bridges in Indiana, too.  Check out Parke County.  As for letterboxes <br/>
and covered bridges - I found boxes at - Longwood Bridge, Sunday Drive and Picnic, <br/>
Potter's Bridge and Busching Bridge.  For those also interested in Benchmark Hunting, <br/>
there is a benchmark at Busching Bridge.<br/>
