<br/>Mary and I went to Storm King today and found the Peace Mother and Black Flag boxes.  They're both in good shape.  We were unable to find the King's Ritual.  I'm not sure if we were in the right area or not.  The Orbit was easy enough, but the needle ......? We thought we had it, but I'm not sure.  The real problem came when we were to locate  the tree that reminds one of the King's Ritual.  We don't know what that looks like.  It was hot and buggy and we were done, so we left it for another day.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks for the great day.

<div>The actual sculpture that is the key to finding the Kings 
Ritual box has probably been put into storage. I haven't had a chance to replant 
the box yet, but I will do it sometime this summer.</div>
