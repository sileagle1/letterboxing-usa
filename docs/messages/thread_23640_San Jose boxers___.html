                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Amy, <br/>
  I am not from San Jose, but my daughter is, I was there in May and June  for the birth of my first grandchild.  I have planted a box in his  honor, have to post the directions on AQ and LBNA, but will do that  hopefully tonight.<br/>
  we really liked the three boxes we got to:<br/>
  Charles Martinet,,, by chuck e cheeses (piece of cake, er, pizza)<br/>
  maybe next year...by the hockey arena (this one was a little tricky, but the placer is very helpful)<br/>
  drive-in.... if you are not from SJ you will need help with this one, but the food is fabulous.  <br/>
  especially the banana milkshakes!<br/>
  email if you'd like some help!  <br/>
  we have also been to the two at the egyptian museum, and they were fun....<br/>
  and one other I can't remember now, but the directions take you near a  duck pond that you can't swim in.... careful here there are bees and  ants all over the box.   if you want more info on this one  email.<br/>
  have fun!<br/>
