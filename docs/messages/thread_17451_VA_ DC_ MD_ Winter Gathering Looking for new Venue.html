                    <div class="plaintext-content">Got back from vacation and made it out to the new Air &amp; Space Udvar <br/>
Hazy Center.  The parking situation is terrible.  They are "sold out" <br/>
of yearly parking passes.  The Food Court will not open until March.  <br/>
So I am really discouraged and looking for a new venue.<br/>
<br/>
I am open to ideas.  I would still like to have it in VA.  Y'all in <br/>
MD can organize a picnic in the spring. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I am considering the Tysons II Galeria food court, or the Pentagon <br/>
City Mall food court.  Both have plenty of free or cheap parking, a <br/>
variety of food without fussing with the check, and plenty of space <br/>
for kids to run around.  <br/>
<br/>
I would rather be closer to a big group of letterboxes, like <br/>
Herndon/Reston, Sterling/Loudon, or Fairfax/Burke.<br/>
<br/>
The date is still Saturday, January 24th.<br/>
<br/>
At this rate it will become a mystery gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Air &amp; Space Annex claims they're sold out of yearly passes in the <br/>
first week?  That stinks.  We live about ten minutes from it and were <br/>
going to take the kids over break, but haven't made it yet because the <br/>
papers report big crowds plus reports of folks having to pay the day's <br/>
$12 parking just to go inside to buy the $50 pass.  Decided we'd give <br/>
them a bit of time to work things out.  UGH.<br/>
<br/>
Alternate indoor kid-friendly venues at my end of Fairfax County: <br/>
1) Dulles Town Center mall <br/>
(http://www.shopdullestowncenter.com/main.html) - 28 &amp; 7, <br/>
Sterling/Countryside.  Upstairs food court has carousel and is adjacent <br/>
to airport-themed play area.  Very close to Claude Moore Park.  Straight <br/>
shot down 28 to Ellanor Lawrence (sp?; boxes) and Walney (boxes).<br/>
2) Fair Oaks Mall (http://www.shopfairoaksmall.com/index.html) - West Ox <br/>
&amp; 50, Fairfax.  No specific food court, but lots o' places to eat in the <br/>
arms plus a small, usually busy "breakfast foods" play area for very <br/>
little kids.  Not far from Ellanor Lawrence (sp?; boxes) and Walney <br/>
(boxes) and Sully Plantation (no boxes that I know of, but it's neat).<br/>
<br/>
We live about halfway between the above malls, very close to Frying Pan <br/>
Park (2 boxes).  Should we look instead for a quickie food venue that <br/>
has play space for the kids so we can feed them and branch out to boxes <br/>
from there?  There are several such - Chick-Fil-A on the Reston/Herndon <br/>
line, just off of Spring St./Sunset Hills and 7100; a huge McDonald's <br/>
and a huge Burger King across from each other in Centreville on 28 north <br/>
of 29 and near 66...  Is any of the stuff at Planet Splash 'n' Play on <br/>
28 near Westfields indoors AND open in the winter?  We haven't been <br/>
there yet.<br/>
Would help the planning to know how many kids we're talking about and <br/>
their ages.  I'm guessing mine (almost 2 and almost 5) are among the <br/>
youngest, and I know the Doubtful Guests have teens who would get bored <br/>
at the breakfast play area at Fair Oaks.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of one other place that has always sounded interesting; <br/>
never been there.  It's about 40 minutes' drive w/o much traffic from <br/>
our house.  I've heard it's a small but neat place.  Aimed at <br/>
10-and-under so it may be boring for teens; don't know.<br/>

The Washington Post article from 3/22/02 <br/>
(http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=entertainment/profile&amp;id=1070945&amp;typeId=3) <br/>
says, in part:<br/>
"Open 9 to 3 Monday through Friday, 10 to 6 Saturdays and noon to 5 <br/>
Sundays. Admission is $5; $4 for ages older than 55 and visitors in <br/>
groups of 10 or more; and free for ages younger than 2. A frequent <br/>
visitor pass enables a family to receive one free admission after nine <br/>
paid admissions. The museum offers two party rooms, and party packages <br/>
that cost from $85 to $200 for up to 10 children. The museum does not <br/>
accept credit cards."<br/>

We like either one of these - offers  a variety of food choices and<br/>
plenty of room for all age groups - plus either is an easy exit for<br/>
those coming off the Beltway. <br/>

metro and as a mom with a couple of young kids in tow, it will be, <br/>
by far, the easiest method of getting there for us (especially after <br/>
the cross country trip to that area we'll be taking the day prior to <br/>
the event).  After spending years in Seattle traffic, each week I'm <br/>
not too keen on fighting metro DC traffic in a vehicle in the winter-<br/>
-after I haven't visited the area for a LONG time.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, from previous gatherings we've attended/coordinated, <br/>
I've learned personally that I'd rather use the gathering time to <br/>
get to meet other letterboxers--since that's sort of the reason <br/>
folks are attending the event anyway (especially when you reside in <br/>
an area with very few active letterboxers and really meeting a <br/>
fellow letterboxer on the trail is highly improbable).  If there are <br/>
too many 'resident' letterboxes in the area, then folks tend to <br/>
scatter pretty quickly looking for the boxes and then rarely <br/>
reassemble as a group--you never really get to meet all of the other <br/>
letterboxers at the gathering.  Of course, this is only my personal <br/>
preference--I presume other folks feel the exact opposite about <br/>
these things.<br/>

I'm certainly glad there is a change in venue.  I know about the <br/>
horrible parking situation at the new air museum and had decided not <br/>
to attend the event for that very reason.  Now that its being moved <br/>
to a better location, count me in!  <br/>

Pentagon City or Tysons II are both OK for me.  But I agree with Ivy <br/>
that Pentagon City, being metro accessible, may be easier for more <br/>
people.  <br/>
