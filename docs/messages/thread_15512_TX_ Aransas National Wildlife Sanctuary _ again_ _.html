                    <div class="plaintext-content">   This afternoon, kind of on the spur of the moment, I decided to <br/>
go to the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge again  without the <br/>
grandchildren  to try to find Silver Eagle's Aransas Whooping Crane <br/>
letterbox. My #3 son had expressed some interest in letterboxing <br/>
previously, so I asked if he wanted to go too. He jumped at the <br/>
chance, so off we went. <br/>
  This time, we went after the box first, and did some `random' <br/>
hiking and wildlife watching afterwards. We had a much easier hike, <br/>
this time, and after some searching for the `right' tree, he found <br/>
it. The box is in great shape. Gosh, we felt like hobbits in the <br/>
dense woods or something, with all those huge trees and thick <br/>
brush. :)  My son used a leaf from the trail and his fingerprint to <br/>
make his stamp in the book, since he didn't have a carved stamp yet. <br/>
Then he stamped the box's stamp onto plain paper, so he can cut it <br/>
out and put it in his log book when he gets one.  <br/>
 We went to the Jones Lake area, looking for alligators, but didn't <br/>
see any this time. We did see a tree frog, a ribbon snake, and four <br/>
deer, though and some lizards and lots of birds and butterflies, <br/>
throughout the Sanctuary, of course. The plant life there is amazing <br/>
too! There are so many unusual and beautiful flowers blooming, some <br/>
very spicy or pungent smelling. We talked a lot about the Karankawa <br/>
Tribe, who lived in this area firsttheir weapons, culture, <br/>
artifacts, way of living, etc. This time I took the whole tour loop, <br/>
rather than the quickest way out with tired kids. I have to say it <br/>
was a great time, even if I did feel bad for not taking them this <br/>
time. <br/>
  And my son is carving a stamp and plans on getting a log book <br/>
tomorrow! :)<br/>
