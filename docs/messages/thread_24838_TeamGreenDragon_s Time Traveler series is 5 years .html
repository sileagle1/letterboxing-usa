TeamGreenDragon, congrats on an excellent series, job well done.  <br/>
Thank you for your hard work and a great time.<br/>

Wow!!!!  This means that we have been letterboxing for five years!  <br/>
Time sure does fly. (pun intended ;)  We started boxing just after that <br/>
series came out and they were some of our first boxes found.  They were <br/>
a wonderful adventure that we cherish.  But just like in the clues, <br/>
maybe one needs to do a little work to find them.  Letterboxing like <br/>
most things is what you make of it.  For those that choose to dig <br/>
deeper, a wealth of riches is just waiting to be found.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
