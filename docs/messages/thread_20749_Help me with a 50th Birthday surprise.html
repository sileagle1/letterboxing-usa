I am looking for 50 letterboxers interested in helping me send 50 birthday postcards.  I <br/>
will provide the postage paid postcards and include an extra card with my stamp for you <br/>
to keep.  All I ask is that you be willing to put the postcard with your trail stamp in the <br/>
mail to the birthday recipient in time for the 50th Birthday.  If you are interested in this <br/>
project, email me privately at ruhlette at yahoo_dot_com.  Thanks!<br/>

Thank You, Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue!  You are the 37th to help me!  If anyone else would like <br/>
to participate, email me privately at ruhlette at yahoo dot com.  I'll need a mailing address <br/>
to send you the postcards and instructions, which may be very soon.  I'll also send a <br/>
reminder out about 10 days before the 50th birthday - in January.<br/>
<br/>
I am so thrilled at the positive response.  Letterboxers rock.<br/>
<br/>
a very happy speedsquare<br/>
