                    <div class="plaintext-content">Four questions:<br/>
    Can anyone help me locate Martin, the placer of  "Have a Great Day" <br/>
LB in Rochester/Monroe County? I'm quite sure the box is missing but I <br/>
would be willing to replace it or share a replacement if the original <br/>
placer can't be located.<br/>
    Does anyone know what the original stamp looked like?<br/>
    If it turns out that I am able to replace and maintain this box, and <br/>
not knowing the design of the original stamp, what would be the most <br/>
appropriate way to replace the stamp? I have a design in mind that is in <br/>
keeping with the location.<br/>
    Finally, would it be appropriate to modify the final clue regarding <br/>
distance (steps/paces) to where the box is located. Maybe add a little <br/>
additional Erie Canal history, too?<br/>
Thanks to all who might like to comment,<br/>
