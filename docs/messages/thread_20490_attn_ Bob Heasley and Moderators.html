&gt; Subject: [LbNA] Need help on falling apart stamp pad<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have a 3 color stamp pad (now discontinued) that<br/>
&gt; I use for my<br/>
&gt; &gt; personal stamp.  I love the colors and was nursing<br/>
&gt; it along, but now<br/>
&gt; &gt; one of the pads has come off.  Does anyone know<br/>
&gt; how to reattach it? <br/>
&gt; &gt; It's still damp with ink so tape won't work.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>

I felt it important to provide some information I<br/>
discovered about "Mr." Bob Heasley, aka WPaMensan Bob,<br/>
in case you meet him on the trails.  <br/>
<br/>
As Armadillo Jo wrote, yes, this is the same person<br/>
who threatened to remove Ohio letterboxes because<br/>
someone had planted a box in Ohio, discovered that it<br/>
was planted near some allergic-reaction causing<br/>
plants, and removed the box &amp; updated their clues, but<br/>
he went to look for the box without first checking the<br/>
clues to make sure everything was still current.  I<br/>
had some personal correspondence with him about this<br/>
situation to try to determine why he'd react the way<br/>
he had.  <br/>
<br/>
Troll, yes, but he is also an active letterboxer. <br/>
Deedle &amp; I have seen his stamp &amp; signature in area<br/>
letterboxes, with dates as recent as August 2004<br/>
(we're from Cleveland, Ohio).  He actually lives in<br/>
Sewickley, Pennsylvania, but evidently that's only a<br/>
few hours' drive away from areas of Ohio.  And, if you<br/>
check letterboxing.org, he also has some of his own<br/>
plants out there.<br/>
<br/>
So fellow boxers, proceed with caution in case you run<br/>
into him on the trails.  I don't know what he looks<br/>
like, just what the stamp he uses in letterbox logs<br/>
looks like.  I thought it important to share what I<br/>
know about him since he wasn't just some bored<br/>
trouble-maker looking to cause mayhem (as if we needed<br/>
any more here) - he was actually an active letterboxer<br/>
looking to cause mayhem.<br/>
<br/>
Mark Pepe - question - even if he's banned from the<br/>
talk list, is he still able to access the post archive<br/>
directly from the yahoo groups site?<br/>
<br/>
Doodle, hoping this ugliness is behind us and that I<br/>
_don't_ run into him on the trail...<br/>

&gt; Sigh...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please know that most of the boxers in Ohio are NOT<br/>
&gt; like  him at all!!!<br/>

&gt; Mama Stork<br/>

&gt;  He was the<br/>
