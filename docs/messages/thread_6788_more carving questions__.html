<br/>
Back a few days ago, Susan encouraged sharpening carving blades with Emery sand paper.  I am off to go purchase some at the beloved Home Depot (aka - Burly Man Central!)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on technique for sharpening would be greatly appreciated.  Also, is the sand paper better than a wet stone?  I am just noticing that my blades are getting a little dull.<br/>
<br/>
Also..<br/>
I was in Michael's today and saw two magazines regarding rubber stamping.  I barely skimmed through one of them and it seemed more geared to stamping with store bought stamps.  Does anyone get any of these magazines?  Are any of them worth purchasing?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for everyone's continued wisdom!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I made a couple of stamps a few months ago. Instead of the carving<br/>
method, I created a black &amp; white design on the computer, and printed it<br/>
out from my laser printer in the size I wanted. My local stamp store<br/>
then took the image and created a stamp from it.<br/>
<br/>
I was rather impressed with the results, though I can see the benefit<br/>
and beauty of the carving method. Unfortunately if I carved the stamp I<br/>
would end up with several stitches. I'm much more skilled with a mouse<br/>
than a carving knife ;)<br/>
<br/>
If you do go this route, make sure to make the design as smooth as<br/>
possible on the paper. Mine had digitized slightly and the pixilation<br/>
was visible on the final result.<br/>
