Redwing Park (2)<br/>
Virginia Beach, VA<br/>

TERRAIN: Easy; nice stroll among the gardens. <br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY: Easy, a pace is one footfall, all<br/>
bearings are magnetic.<br/>

<br/>
Redwing Park is located in Virginia Beach at 1398<br/>
General Booth Boulevard.  These boxes are very near<br/>
the Flame of Hope stamp on Oceana Boulevard. After<br/>
stamping in at the Flame of Hope continue south on<br/>
Oceana Boulevard until the major intersection with<br/>
General Booth Boulevard.  Take a right onto General<br/>
Booth.  Redwing Park is almost immediately on your<br/>
left.  If you miss the turn, continue down to the<br/>
intersection of General Booth and Dam Neck Road.  A U<br/>
turn here will bring you back by the park. <br/>
<br/>
 Bring a lunch to enjoy in the picnic area after<br/>
stamping in.  There is a nice small playground for the<br/>
kids to burn off extra energy as well as a playground<br/>
for your pooch, too!  <br/>
<br/>
Park in the first parking lot to your left as you<br/>
enter the park.  You may wish to enjoy the Japanese<br/>
and Rose gardens before beginning your search. Cross<br/>
the road and enter the Redwing Gardens.  The Garden<br/>
Gnome eagerly awaits your arrival.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Garden Gnome<br/>
Start your search at the Redwing Gardens sign just<br/>
inside the ivy garlanded white fence.  Before you lay<br/>
four different paths.  Which one to take to visit with<br/>
the Garden Gnome?  Take the 1st paved trail heading<br/>
east.  Stay on this trail for a little while until two<br/>
bridges come into sight.  <br/>
<br/>
Under one bridge lives the evil troll.  Some say the<br/>
metal railings of his bridge act as a lightning rod<br/>
causing him to be hit many times over the years by<br/>
these terrifying bolts. This has surely caused a bit<br/>
of his insanity. He is not to be disturbed at any cost<br/>
as he most certainly is not a gracious host!  Beware!<br/>
<br/>
Under the other bridge lives our kindly Gnome.  He<br/>
spends his time tending the gardens in Redwing Park. <br/>
The wooden construction of his home keeps him safe<br/>
during storms.   Youll find your treasure hidden<br/>
under the end of the bridge nearest the picnic<br/>
shelters and within sight of the trolls home.  Be<br/>
careful, as this can be slippery when wet.  After<br/>
stamping in carefully rehide the box.<br/>
<br/>
Redwing Park Stamp<br/>
<br/>
Once you have received your stamp move toward the<br/>
center of the bridge facing the trolls bridge.  Look<br/>
at your stamped image- the Garden Gnome points the way<br/>
to your next find!  (Or, standing in the center of the<br/>
bridge, take a bearing of 260 degrees).<br/>
<br/>
Continue on your journey by following the paved path<br/>
to your left.  The Garden Gnome would like you to<br/>
enjoy the many flowering bushes and trees as you go. <br/>
Soon you will come upon a stone-encased water<br/>
fountain/bubbler on your right.  Continue this path to<br/>
the Fragrance Gardens.  The Fragrance Gardens were<br/>
planted especially for the blind to enjoy but were<br/>
sure you will enjoy the beautiful smells, too.<br/>
<br/>
Take a moment to smell the Dwarf Gardenia, the<br/>
Pitosporum, the Lilac and the Anise bushes. Find the<br/>
Ligstrum bush and take a bearing of 32 degrees to the<br/>
paved path.  Follow the paved path bearing to the left<br/>
as it meanders around the topiary.  Before reaching<br/>
the covered wishing well you will see a gravel path to<br/>
your right.  Take the gravel path.  Shortly you must<br/>
decide which path to choose.<br/>
<br/>
At the intersection of many paths take a bearing of<br/>
100 degrees.  20 paces ahead you will find the Mrs.<br/>
C.L. Hershberger crepe myrtle memorial tree.  From<br/>
here locate the U shaped tree.  At the U shaped<br/>
tree follow the gravel path to the right until it<br/>
connects again with the paved path.  Continue on,<br/>
bearing left to your second gravel path on the left. <br/>
Nestled within the trees here (bearing 350 degrees) is<br/>
a bench to take a rest.  While sitting on the bench<br/>
locate the pair of trees growing together to your<br/>
left.  Youll find the Redwing Park stamp hidden under<br/>
the pine needles in a small cubby at the base of the<br/>
tree nearest to the bench.  Stamp in and rehide well. <br/>
