Nice goin' you carvin' fools!  I carved for box #5 in the Duck Creek Series<br/>
yesterday--and I'm afraid the duck looks more like an exotic egyptian<br/>
bird...oh, well!  I'm going to see what I can do to get the next--and<br/>
probably last--carving done in the series this week and then get them both<br/>
out there!<br/>
<br/>
I want to go see what Sylvia, Sheila and Junanne did to the journals in my<br/>
boxes when they visited a week or so ago.  I thought I'd be checking them<br/>
much sooner, but life got in my way...oh, and a cold bug.  Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you Nisa?  I'd love to drop in and find your box...<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>

<br/>
Hey, I'd go looking for a letterbox with an exotic Egyptian duck<br/>
anytime!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm in NH - that's a bit far from Texas, right?  :)  Oh well, if<br/>
you're ever in the area - it does seem like letterboxing is booming in<br/>
New England - c'mon over!  I don't think I'll be getting another one out<br/>
before Christmas (someone said snow soon!), but I'm fixing to have the<br/>
next one out by spring (hey, how's that for talkin' Texan??  when I<br/>
first heard that phrase, I thought all the kids I was screening had a<br/>
language impairment!).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your boxes!<br/>
<br/>

Nice to hear you'd accept my duck however she turns out...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Anyway, I'm in NH - that's a bit far from Texas, right?<br/>
Yes it is, darn it...<br/>
<br/>

&gt;next one out by spring (hey, how's that for talkin' Texan??<br/>
I'ts shockingly realistic--when my kids come home with this phrase--which<br/>
they actually pick up from TEACHERS! (yikes) I give them a hard time about<br/>
it until they drop it.  They may have been born here, but I wasn't and<br/>
there's only so much fixin' I can listen to...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;when I<br/>
&gt;first heard that phrase, I thought all the kids I was screening had a<br/>

Well, you may have been right!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck getting another box out before the snow.<br/>

    It could be that the real purpose of your life is only to serve as a<br/>

Oh but I much prefer "fixin' to..." over the alternative I hear more often....<br/>
they leave off the middle of the word---the X for pete's sake-----and say<br/>
"fin"   ...<br/>
"I'm FIN to go to work"<br/>
<br/>
Oh PLEASE!!!!!<br/>
As for me, being a terrific procrastinator, I do enjoy saying "I'm thinkin'<br/>
about fixin' to get goin'...." hehehehe<br/>
