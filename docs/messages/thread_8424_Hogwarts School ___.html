to the tower (in the rain) on 10/11/02--couldn't find any of the <br/>

rest--We want to go back (on a nice day) but was wondering if anyone <br/>
knew if the boxes were still up there??  Thanks~ Irish Mum<br/>

Hiya! We're pretty sure the first box is missing, and the others have <br/>
proven harder than necessary for a children's-oriented series. Sorry <br/>
about that!<br/>
<br/>
If you email us off-list we'll make sure you were at the right <br/>
starting point...<br/>

<br/>These clues are in the Mystery Boxes section of CT. Sort of an open secret, I suppose. We've been meaning to get out there for a while, just haven't yet.....

   We ventured out for the hogwarts school on 10/11/02--unfortunately <br/>
in the rain and with 6 kids age 7 to 13, it was quite the hike--but <br/>
fun, and a big accomplishment for the kids--lots of miles, lots of <br/>
hills!! We weren't able to follow the clues for a number of reasons! <br/>
We know the first box is definately missing--verified with the <br/>
drewclan.. from there it was difficult to follow--especially in the <br/>
rain with tired wet kids!!Ha Ha!! We will have to try again--just <br/>
have to wait for another day off from school!!  BRING A CAMERA--you <br/>
will be amazed if you have never been there!! It truly is an <br/>
incredible place--do it now before the leaves fall off!! Make sure it <br/>
is on a clear day too if you can-- Good luck--let me know if you find <br/>
the boxes! <br/>
