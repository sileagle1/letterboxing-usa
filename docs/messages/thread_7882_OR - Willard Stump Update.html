Trek: Easy, a bit uphill <br/>
The original owner and settler in the land around Macleay Park was <br/>
Danford Balch. He carved out a space in the forest for a large cabin <br/>
in which to house himself, his wife, and their nine children. A <br/>
nearby donation land claim was taken by the Stump family. The two <br/>
families did not care for each other. In true Shakespearean fashion, <br/>
Mortimer Stump, the eldest son of the clan, began courting Anna, the <br/>
oldest of the Balch daughters. Danford Balch, a peaceful man, warned <br/>
Mortimer to stay away from his fifteen-year-old daughter, but <br/>
Mortimer paid no heed. When Anna turned sixteen, she and Mortimer ran <br/>
away to Vancouver, where they eloped. Two weeks later, Danford Balch <br/>
met members of the Stump family, including Mortimer, at the Stark <br/>
Street Ferry. They began arguing and Balch shot Mortimer with his <br/>
shotgun, killing him instantly. Balch later became the first man to <br/>
be legally hanged in Oregon. The creek that runs through Macleay Park <br/>
bears his name because for years after his hanging people still <br/>
referred to that area as "The Old Balch Place." <br/>
To The Trailhead: From downtown Portland head west on NW Lovejoy, <br/>
which turns into NW Cornell Road. The Audubon Nature House is about  <br/>
mile beyond the second tunnel, on the right. Go about one block <br/>
further west, there is a parking area at the trailhead to Collins <br/>
Sanctuary. <br/>
Alternately, park at the Audubon Nature House and pick up a map, <br/>
located in a cupboard by the entrance to the Nature Store. It will <br/>
come in handy for the multitude of letterboxes in the area. Carefully <br/>
cross the road at the crosswalk. Walk about one block further west to <br/>
the trailhead at the Collins Sanctuary. <br/>
To The Letterbox: Head up the Collins Trail into the Collins <br/>
Sanctuary. When you reach the first trail intersection, go right.At <br/>
this junction begin counting the boardwalks. Duck under and stepover. <br/>
After you've walked the planks for the third time, go eighteen steps <br/>
more. Willard S Stump is hiding to your right at the base of a <br/>
rotting stump.<br/>
Continue along the Collins Trail.  Count three more boardwalks.  Step <br/>
over a stepover, step over another stepover (don't fall in the hole). <br/>
Go 6-1/2 paces (13 steps) to where you see on your left some logs <br/>
making an `X' over Willard T. Stump.   <br/>
