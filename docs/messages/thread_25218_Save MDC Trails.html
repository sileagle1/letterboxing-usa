	Dear Athletes: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are a runner in central Connecticut, you have probably logged many, many miles in the beautiful and serene MDC reservoir areas in West Hartford and Avon.   These trails may soon be closed to all forms of recreation including running, walking, hiking and biking due to a liability issue that makes the MDC vulnerable to lawsuits if an accident occurs on their land.  Granting the MDC immunity would require the State Legislature to pass a law, but the legislature is not scheduled to reconvene until January 2011.  A solution must be found before then to continue public access to these beautiful areas.  <br/>
<br/>
The MDC will be holding a public hearing on Tuesday, July 20 at 5:30pm the West Hartford Town Hall Auditorium.  I encourage everyone who is concerned to attend the meeting and/or sign the online petition located at www.savethemdctrails.org.  <br/>
<br/>
Just imagine never again "scooping the loop" or tackling Kilkenny Hill!  Please voice your opinion by attending the hearing or signing the petition.  <br/>

Thanks for your support and happy running!<br/>
