                    <div class="plaintext-content">L&amp;H, my 8 year old son Ned and I would be pleased to show you around <br/>
our back yard at Hartman Park in Lyme, where there are 4 letterboxes <br/>
especially designed for children. You can see the clues at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/ma/gnomelet.htm<br/>
<br/>
They would be particularly easy for you to visit yourself, without an <br/>
eight year old guide, as well. If you've got a current copy of "50 <br/>
Hikes in CT" in your library, Hartman Park is well described to help <br/>
with any pre-hike jitters. We could head up there on Sunday afternoon <br/>
if you'd like: maybe that would be a fun way to meet some other local <br/>
letterboxers as well. Anyone interested?<br/>

If you are ever in the vicinity of Eastern Mountain Sports in the Crystal Mall (in Waterford,CT) , stop in sometime and you will not only find an info center full of Letterboxing Clues. You will also find a few letterboxers working there... one being myself (guy in red jacket in news article). I'm always willing to team up with fellow letterboxers to go "hunting" and maybe we can put our heads together to solve the mysterious "Ray's Dilemma."<br/>

&gt;Saw the article in the Hartford Courant Newspaper about Letterboxing and<br/>
&gt;am  greatly interested in starting.  I have enjoyed hiking for many<br/>
&gt;years and now am taking my 2 1/2 year old son with me.  He loves the<br/>
&gt;backpack and all the things we see in the woods.  I think this would be<br/>
&gt;so interesting for the two of us to start doing but I am a little afraid<br/>
&gt;the get started by myself.  Would anyone be interested in teaming up<br/>
&gt;with me for a trip or two just so I can get familiar with things?  I<br/>
&gt;would enjoy hearing from people who would be interested.  If not, then<br/>
&gt;maybe some tips as to how to start.  Looking forward to some help. <br/>

Hi, I am also newly aware and interested via the Courant article. I have been making a stamp, but have yet to venture out. I have done a lot of hiking, and like to solve puzzles. I won't be able to give you pointers, but am willing to have you join on some of my searches if you like.     Tina<br/>
