                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Hi, I am new to this yahoo group . . . and new to letterboxing. I <br/>
had read about it on letterboxing.org after seeing it in <br/>
Smithsonian, and recently a student in one of my art rubber stamp <br/>
classes had showed me her log book - too kewl! <br/>
<br/>
 We live near the Metacomet Trail in CT and we often hike there. <br/>
Earlier this year I had printed out instructions from the website, <br/>
and Saturday I finally remembered to bring them with us. We found  <br/>
both! I even took photos and will upload them to my website soon. It <br/>
was a very exciting event! <br/>
<br/>
 The 2 boxes that we found were 'The Barrel of Monkeys' Letterbox <br/>
and 'The Holy Cow - what a view!' Letterbox, planted by the same <br/>
family. The Barrel of Monkeys was in fine shape with a wonderful <br/>
handcarved monkey stamp. The Holy Cow Letterbox had a small amount <br/>
of water in the container, but because everything was ziplocked up, <br/>
it was in fine shape, and I got the water out. I was the first to <br/>
stamp in the log book of that letterbox this year - I belive the <br/>
last entry was Fall of 2002! The monkey box was visited in March of <br/>
this year, I believe.<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, it was great fun, kind of melds my husbands love for hiking <br/>
with my love of art stamping, and I know there are a lot more boxes <br/>
around here for us to find! If anyone has any suggestions for us, <br/>
being new at this - please let us know. When I upload the photos I <br/>
will announce it here.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks, Lenna &amp; John<br/>
