<br/>
&lt;&lt; By the way, when are people planning to arrive on Saturday? I want to meet <br/>
as many of you as I can, but I'm going to have to leave early to make it to a <br/>
<br/>
surprise 50th birthday party.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I plan on arriving at the picnic grounds at Burlingame on Saturday morning <br/>
sometime between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM, leaving myself plenty of time both to <br/>
shmooze (and, of course, exchange stamps) with my fellow letterboxers and to <br/>
actually get out into Charlestown and its environs and look for some 'boxes!<br/>
<br/>
This past January's letterboxing gathering in Tolland, CT (organized by our <br/>
favorite Leader of the Pack) was so much fun and brought so many nice folks <br/>
together that I'm looking forward to Saturday's event in a big way! Let's <br/>
hope that Mother Nature is feeling cooperative, too.<br/>
<br/>
See some of you soon!<br/>
<br/>

Alan from Axtown<br/>
