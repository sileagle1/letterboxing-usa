There are a lot of people out there hunting even though they shouldn't <br/>

If you go out with a dog - they should have a vest too.<br/>

<div>I think that wearing an orange vest, even in the 
city is a good idea.  Think about this...  When was the last time that 
you saw someone in an orange vest walking around somewhere staring at the 
ground or looking behind or under things and you thought "Gee!  That 
guy is acting strangely.  I wonder what he's looking for?"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>An orange vest would be perfect camouflage for 
urban letterboxing!!  ; )</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just an aside... as a hunter, I would highly suggest not just a vest <br/>
with blaze orange, but a hat too.  Dense cover and corn can really <br/>
prevent you from seein orange but most people are tall enough that a <br/>
hat will stick up over bushes, etc. And my dog wears an orange <br/>
bandana around her neck when we go in the woods....<br/>
