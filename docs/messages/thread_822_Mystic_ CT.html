went in, Mystic unfortunately had a major fire along part of the route.<br/>
We haven't been down to see for ourselves, but we're sure this<br/>
wonderful seaside town will always be worth a visit. You can also see<br/>
the clue on our website at:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Captain's Walk<br/>
<br/>
An easy three mile walk through the historic district of Mystic<br/>
Connecticut, passing the homes of many 19th Century sea captains.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: from I-95 in Mystic, CT, take exit 89 (Allyn Street). Turn<br/>
south toward Mystic and take the first left onto Sandy Hollow Rd.<br/>
Follow the boat launch signs to turn left on High St, right on Bindloss<br/>
Ave, and then left on River Rd. Follow River Rd northward to pass under<br/>
the I-95 bridges and park in the jogger's and stroller's area along the<br/>
river.<br/>
<br/>
Taking foot, backtrack southwards downstream on River Road with the<br/>
water on your left for about  mile to the historic district. Turn left<br/>
on Starr St, which will become Pearl St for a block, and then turn left<br/>
onto Eldridge St. In a short way, turn left on Gravel St and follow it<br/>
to the end. Carefully cross busy Main St in the crosswalk and turn left<br/>
(east), enjoying the shops and boutiques. Just as you step onto the<br/>
drawbridge, turn right onto the decked wharf along the river. Follow<br/>
the wharf downstream and pass through the Steamboat Wharf gate (public<br/>
coastal access is protected by law). Follow the wharf a short way<br/>
further to turn right toward a parking lot. Find a bench there at the<br/>
bottom of the little cove, with the Captain's Walk letterbox tucked<br/>
into the flowerbox behind it, in the eastern corner.<br/>
<br/>
Now head east, passing behind condos and back to the river. Walk<br/>
between the river to your left and the Mystic Art Association to the<br/>
right, and then turn right with the path. In the parking lot, with<br/>
ledge straight ahead, turn right past the front door of the Art<br/>
Association and then jog left out onto the main street at the little<br/>
gatehouse. Turn right, northeast, here (or first explore the shops and<br/>
quirky restaurants), and walk a block down to the intersection with Rte<br/>
1. Go left, west, at the crosswalk, and then right to cross over to the<br/>
north side of the road by Mystic Pizza - yes, that Mystic Pizza.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left and walk westerly uphill towards the imposing Union Baptist<br/>
Church. Turn right just before it onto High St and walk several scenic<br/>
northbound blocks. Turn right on Clift St, then left on Clift Lane,<br/>
then right on Starr St and finally left onto River Rd, back to the<br/>
start.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Just wanted to report the first box in Aix sponsa walk is missing.<br/>
According to the second box on the route, it has been missing for a while -<br/>
just making sure it was reported. The second box is  intact, but really,<br/>
really hard to find!<br/>
