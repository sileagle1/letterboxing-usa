Doctor's Park, Fox Point, Wisconsin<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As children grow older their horizons expand and their adventures <br/>
include new places and greater distances. Fox Point's Doctor's Park <br/>
was slightly further from home than Indian Creek, but at the time it <br/>
seemed like a much greater trip. Those adventures began when we <br/>
thought that we were accomplished bike riders and could negotiate <br/>
village streets.<br/>
<br/>
Doctor's Park is on the shore of Lake Michigan. It was our first <br/>
swimming hole. That water was too cold for any but the most <br/>
adventurous. The spectacle of "sensible" adults shunning the water for <br/>
the comforts of the beach was all the encouragement we needed to throw <br/>
ourselves in and swim as far as we could for as long as we could stand <br/>
the cold and then a bit longer. The grumpy lifeguards were required to <br/>
row their boats out to follow the few who would dare to enter that <br/>
water. We delighted in swimming all the way out to the floats forcing <br/>
those surly "bay watchers" to follow us around. After several cycles <br/>
between the floats and the sand to recover, we could explore the <br/>
several ravines in the park. In later years Doctor's Park has <br/>
continued to be a place for a good trail run and hill workout. Its <br/>
secluded spots overlooking the lake remain a valuable place for <br/>
contemplation of the complexities of adult existence.<br/>
<br/>
The park was a gift of Doctor Joseph Schneider, "eminent physician, <br/>
true humanitarian and ardent lover of nature. Dedicated by him 'to my <br/>
fellow citizens for recreation purposes. It's natural beauty to be <br/>
preserved and bird life to be fostered.'" The gift was accepted by the <br/>
Milwaukee common council on July 11, 1928.<br/>
<br/>
Fox Point is a village to the north of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. To reach <br/>
Doctor's Park exit Interstate 43 at the Brown Deer Road exit. Proceed <br/>
east on Brown Deer Road and turn south at the first traffic light, <br/>
Port Washington Road. Travel approximately half a mile south to Dean <br/>
Road where there is another traffic light. Turn to the East on Dean <br/>
Road. You'll go down a slight hill and across a bridge over the <br/>
remains of Indian Creek and you'll be at the site of Boyhood <br/>
Adventures Number 1.<br/>
<br/>
To reach Boyhood Adventures Number 2 from Number 1 continue east on <br/>
Dean Road for approximately one mile. Your trip will take you across <br/>
Regent Road, Santa Monica Boulevard, and rail road tracks. Your next <br/>
major road crossing will be Lake Drive. Continue east until the road <br/>
bends sharply to the right. Straight ahead you'll see Fox Point's <br/>
Stonehenge standing in Doctor's Park. The parking lot will be to your <br/>
left. Take the paved foot path leaving the northeast area of the <br/>
parking lot. The path will widen out and take you down one of the many <br/>
ravines. Take a right where the path intersects a paved road.<br/>
<br/>
As a boy biking down that paved road seemed to be very bold. The "Walk <br/>
your bike" notice painted on the road surface was just a yellow blur <br/>
at that speed, so we concluded that it was ok to bike as long as we <br/>
were going fast enough.<br/>
<br/>
My first such bicycle decent ended at the bottom of the hill where the <br/>
road makes a right angle turn to the right. In many ways it was and <br/>
still is one of my most memorable exposures to the laws of physics. <br/>
After the front wheel was acted upon by the curb, Newton's third law <br/>
of motion dictated that my body should continue in motion straight <br/>
ahead until acted upon by an impact with the grassy knoll (all before <br/>
Newton's laws or grassy knolls had any special meaning to me).<br/>
<br/>
Follow my path of empirical knowledge to the grassy knoll. Walk north <br/>
along the tree line on the west side of the knoll. At the north-west <br/>
corner of the grass you'll find a little foot path that will take you <br/>
to a barbed wire and cyclone fence. Travel along the fence to the <br/>
West. In a very short distance you'll find a natural drainage gully <br/>
coming down the hill. Being careful of your footing follow that gully <br/>
up hill about two thirds of the way to the top. You'll come to a <br/>
fallen tree perpendicular to the gully. Look to the left and find the <br/>
fallen tree that's parallel to the gully lying along a bearing of 110 <br/>
degrees. Boyhood Adventures Number Two is under the downhill side of <br/>
that tree about midway along its length. You'll find it under a pile <br/>
of tree residue.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping up please replace the box carefully to protect it from <br/>
drainage water rushing down the slope. You can reverse your course to <br/>
leave the park or continue uphill and enjoy a short hike in those <br/>
woods. That area is fairly wild, so please watch your footing. We <br/>
might be young in spirit, but none of us is as young in limb as we <br/>
used to be.<br/>
<br/>
This box will be visited infrequently, so an email about its condition <br/>
and your visit will be very much appreciated.<br/>
