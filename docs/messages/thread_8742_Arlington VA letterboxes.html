The following are all still there -<br/>
<br/>
Gulf Branch/Old Boiler - That waterfall area is beautiful!  Even saw <br/>
a snake!  <br/>
Bluemont Disk Golf Basket<br/>
Glencarlyn Dog Park<br/>
Inligua - there, but is in need of a new box.  Looks like it's been <br/>
chewed through.  Replaced the ziplog bags with new ones, but didn't <br/>
have a spare box.  <br/>

diabolical!  Clambering over scary rocks and down "cliffs" that, of <br/>
course, had to be climbed up on the way back.  Mountain goats <br/>
wouldn't even have chosen that path.  It is most difficult terrain <br/>
yet.  I loved it!<br/>

Someone, please pass the aspirin.  I'm sore today.<br/>
