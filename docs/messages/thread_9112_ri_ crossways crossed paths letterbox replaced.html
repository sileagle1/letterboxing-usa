few weeks ago, I decided to replace another one of my early boxes, <br/>
the Crossways Crossed Paths letterbox.  It was originally hidden by <br/>
myself and CZF (aka Warrior Woman) in August of 2001, but was <br/>
confirmed missing the following March.<br/>
<br/>
This box contains a newly carved stamp (the image is identical to the <br/>
original), a new location, and new clues, so depending on your point <br/>
of view, it can count as a new find.<br/>
<br/>
The following clues can be found at <br/>
<http: crossways.html="" cscm="" letterboxes="" where="" www.quahog.org=""><br/>
<br/>
Crossways Crossed Paths Letterbox<br/>
Glenwood Cemetery, Crossways, East Greenwich, RI<br/>
<br/>
Placed by CZF and CSCM on 20010804.<br/>
Replaced by CSCM on 20021109.<br/>
<br/>
This is a drive-up letterbox with fairly easy clues.<br/>
<br/>
Background<br/>
<br/>
Crossways is an East Greenwich neighborhood named for a farm that <br/>
once operated there.  The first farmhouse, known as the "White <br/>
House," was built on the property in 1772 by Christopher Spencer, and <br/>
still stands at the intersection of Kenyon and Ceder Avenues.  The <br/>
land stayed in the hands of the Spencer family until 1835, when it <br/>
was purchased by Ludowick Updike Shippee.  It was under his ownership <br/>
that the property was dubbed "Crossways Farm."  The farm has since <br/>
been subdivided and sold off in residential lots, but its name <br/>
survives on maps and in memories.  The names of Spencer and Shippee <br/>
likewise adorn local roads and corners.  A large chunk of the farm is <br/>
now East Greenwich Historical Cemetery #26.<br/>
<br/>
Crossways is located about a mile from the spot where CZF and CSCM <br/>
first met in May, 2001, during an alt.rhode_island confab.  They <br/>
became fast friends and their separate paths have since become <br/>
intertwined.  It was CZF who suggested the idea for this, their first <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Directions<br/>
<br/>
1. From Route 95 south take exit 9 to Route 4 south.<br/>
2. Then take exit 8, which will come up very quickly.  At the end of <br/>
the ramp turn right onto Division Street (Route 401).<br/>
3. Drive 1.7 miles and take a right onto Kenyon Avenue.<br/>
4. Drive 0.3 miles to an intersection with Cedar Avenue.<br/>
5. Cross the intersection and enter the place where the dead reside.  <br/>
Keep right and proceed slowly.<br/>
6. Keep an eye out for Christie, a veteran of World War I.  His stone <br/>
is bookended by a pair of shrubs that are taller than you.<br/>
7. Discreetly duck behind Christie and locate the box in the stone <br/>
wall, just above a rounded rock that sits on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
When you've finished stamping up, please be sure to replace the box <br/>
carefully so that it will not be found accidentally by groundskeepers.<br/>
