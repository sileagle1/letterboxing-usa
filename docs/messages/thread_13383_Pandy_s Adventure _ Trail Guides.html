                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been away from the list for a couple of days and read Pandy's <br/>
adventures and the subsequent responses with interest this morning.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, let me say to Pandy that I hope your ankle/foot is <br/>
feeling a bit better and I am really sorry to hear of your <br/>
unfortunate accident.  I am glad you or your aunts were not more <br/>
seriously injured and your frustration is understandable.  <br/>
<br/>
Secondly... I have to admit that my first instinct was pretty close <br/>
to that of the person who responded pointing to the disclaimer.  Call <br/>
it cold if you want to, but it is not meant to be.  There are many <br/>
people who letterbox with children, and there are people of all <br/>
shapes and sizes and fitness and physical ability and agility who <br/>
letterbox.  One of the truly wonderful things is that there is <br/>
something for everyone.  However, that is not the same as saying that <br/>
everyone should be able to do a particular box.<br/>
<br/>
I consider it an added bonus when the clue writer uses a difficulty <br/>
rating system, indicates distance or adds trail comments, and I <br/>
personally do this on my letterboxes.  However, I would not go so far <br/>
as to say that it is something that "should" be noted on all <br/>
letterbox clues.  To the contrary, I think having an indication of <br/>
terrain difficulty in the clues can sometimes give a false sense of <br/>
safety.  If the clues indicate it is not too hard, one may tend to <br/>
press on even once they reach a point where they do not feel safe, <br/>
thinking that to turn around is wimping out...  after all the clues <br/>
say this one is not that difficult.  As we have seen in Pandy's <br/>
experience, even having this information is not always as helpful as <br/>
one might like it to be.  This is not because anyone intentionally <br/>
tried to be misleading or even that the information was inaccurate, <br/>
rather because any kind of a rating system is subjective.  I have <br/>
several hiking guides for trails in Michigan and many of the trails <br/>
are highlighted in more than one book.  It is interesting that even <br/>
the writers of the trail guides cannot agree on the difficulty of a <br/>
particular trail.  That's because such ratings are based on <br/>
somebody's accumulated experience and where this particular venture <br/>
fits into that sphere.  What may be difficult to you, may not seem <br/>
difficult to me.  If you have predominantly hiked flat trails and <br/>
then you have to climb a rock hill, that seems very difficult.  <br/>
However, if you routinely climb mountains, a rock hill is par for the <br/>
course, and you would probably not see it as difficult.  From my own <br/>
personal experience, for those who regularly hike in the sand dunes <br/>
of coastal areas, walking in sand is not that bad.  But for those not <br/>
used to this, rather accustomed to hard-pack trails, sand hiking is <br/>
grueling.  We all have different experiences and perceptions.  There <br/>
is no "average."  <br/>
<br/>
So ultimately it comes down to personal responsibility.  We think <br/>
nothing of a mystery box that does not give a starting point, rather <br/>
makes you research the area to derive this information.  That is part <br/>
of the game.  So too is a box where distance or terrain difficulty is <br/>
not provided.  It becomes the resposibility of the seeker to do some <br/>
research and become familiar with the trail area.  Just as most <br/>
letterboxers wouldn't dream of heading out to a mystery box without <br/>
doing the research to narrow down the starting point as specifically <br/>
as possible, so you should have an idea of what you are getting into <br/>
as far as terrain and possible dangers in the area before you head <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
Until recently there was a box located in the underground of <br/>
Chicago.  For those not familiar, there is a network of streets and <br/>
alleys under the downtown area of Chicago, just as there is in many <br/>
large cities.  This area is not exactly a stroll in the park and <br/>
there are all kinds of shady folks roaming around down there.  This <br/>
is the place where deliveries are made and street people live in <br/>
cardboard boxes.  Anyone who looks out of place is a target.  The <br/>
letterbox clues do not go into detail about the dangers of the <br/>
Chicago underground, nor should they have to.  As the seeker, there <br/>
is a responsibility for researching the area and using common sense <br/>
once you get there.  There is nothing wrong with turning around <br/>
halfway into a hike because you are getting more than you bargained <br/>
for.  That is being wise and knowing your own limitations. <br/>
<br/>
If you don't want to take the time to research a box location, or <br/>
can't find information about the terrain, you have a choice of <br/>
whether to proceed without really knowing what you are getting into, <br/>
or to just try another letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents...  okay maybe four.<br/>
