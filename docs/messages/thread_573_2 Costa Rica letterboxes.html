                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know that Central America is not North America, but just in case anyone decides to make a trip to beautiful Costa Rica, you might pick up two stamps there. <br/>
<br/>
Both of them are at San Gerardo de Dota off the Pan American Highway south of San Jose. San Gerardo de Dota is a hamlet on the Rio Savegre just SW of Cerro de la Muerta known for its trout fishing and bird watching--especially the ability to see many resplendent quetzals.  It's worth the trip to stamp up on these.  The hand made stamps may not thrill you but the experience will. Both the boxes are relatively easy to find (meaning you won't make a trip and be happy you traveled but frustrated that you didn't get a stamp).<br/>
<br/>
Quetzal Letterbox (planted 30 May 1999)San Gerardo de Dota, Costa Rica<br/>
<br/>
Start from the QERC field station building.  I am within 300 M of it. Amongst the Ferns I sit and wait for you to find me. I watch you down the valley scampering around doing your research trying to glean an understanding of my forest. I lie atop a potruding bone of earth. I'm guarded to the south by mora lianas. To my left stands a row of cedar. Standing outside the door of your research building, I'm 30 degrees away. Conduits for your power and your water lie to my right and my left. At night mercury vapor shines in my eyes at 195 degrees. When the ancient arboles to my right looked down the 120 degree trail, they saw my resting place. I look up at 140 degrees and see two grizzled twins standing on a rock talking about all they've seen. Seek me among the grass and vines at your feet and you will find me.  Seek those in whose image I am made and find them. Don't leave the valley until your soul has touched them and found its peace.<br/>
<br/>
Acorn Woodpecker Letterbox (30 May 1999) San Gerardo de Dota, Costa Rica<br/>
<br/>
My people live in a hole in the bole of a dead 'ole tree 217 degrees from me.  We are known for caching acorns.  Perched here on the side of the sendero, I look down on the Chacon orchards and thank them for leaving that hole-full tree.  Behind me I hear the tricke of a spring (106 degrees). As I look across the valley I see a wee white house (304 dgrees). Up slope, a lauracea with a bent left arm stands over me (174 degrees).  The clouds sometimes whirl and spin above the valley covering its cloudforest slopes, but if you look on a clear day from my spot you can see the last peak visible at 344 degrees. A question mark (290 degrees) beckons you to sit down and ponder the meaning of life.  While you do, you may see one of my relatives on the woodpecker tree, or you may see a quetzal slip in amongst the Lauracea below and pluck a wild avocado from a limb.<br/>

<br/>
Congratulations, Dennis, on your two Costa Rica letterboxes!!!  Your clues <br/>
have been added to the Letterboxing North America website.  On the main page, <br/>
click on the flag of Mexico to see the map for Mexico, Central America, and <br/>
The Carribean.  Then click on Costa Rica to see the clues.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the clues for Wendy's Enchanted Palos Verdes Letterbox, Ed's <br/>
latest Long Island letterbox, and Dierdra's two new boxes in Green Bay have <br/>
also been added to the website (not to mention my latest Portland box).<br/>
<br/>
I think Wendy said it best...<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN!!!!   :-)<br/>
Mitch<br/>

<br/>
Actually, my sources indicate that Central America is not a continent in its <br/>
own right.  It is generally regarded as part of North America, as are the <br/>
Carribean Islands.  I've had links to this region on the website since I set <br/>
it up, in anticipation that someone might be adventurous enough to place <br/>
letterboxes there someday.  I wasn't expecting this to happen so soon, <br/>
however.  I expected there would be activity in Canada long before <br/>
letterboxes started showing up in Costa Rica!!!  Great work, Dennis!!<br/>
<br/>
I recently changed the location of the flags on the webpage for asthetic <br/>
reasons, however, and this seems to be causing some problems.  I suspect that <br/>
some people's local browser cache of recently visited sites is failing to <br/>
recognize that the page has changed.<br/>
<br/>
It took a day or so before my own browser recognized the change, but it seems <br/>
to be working fine now.  Randy has reported that he still can't get it to <br/>
work, however.  I would be interested in hearing from others as to whether or <br/>
not they can access the new Costa Rica clues.<br/>
<br/>
The flag of Mexico should currently appear at the TOP of the map, above <br/>
Wisconsin, in line with the Canadian flag.  Clicking on it should take you to <br/>
the map of Mexico, Central America, and the Carribean.  If this doesn't seem <br/>
to work, see if your browser has a way of clearing out the local cache.  If <br/>
you still can't get this to work right, let me know.  Also please tell me if <br/>
it IS working right, so I'll know that everyone is not having the same <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

<br/>
I do not believe its a cache issue.  There is too much evidence against<br/>
that (IMHO -- I've cleared my cache, tried from other locations, etc).  <br/>
<br/>
My hunch is its a browser portability issue, as it works when I use<br/>
Microsoft's browser (which I otherwise never do), and not when I use <br/>
Netscape's browser.  If people are going to report to Mitch whether they<br/>
can access the clues, they should report which browers they can and can't<br/>
do so with.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, changing the shape from "rectangle" to "polygon" for the flags<br/>
may clear up the problem without too much hassle, assuming that it is not<br/>
a cache issue.<br/>
