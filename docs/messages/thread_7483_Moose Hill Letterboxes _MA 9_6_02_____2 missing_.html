                    <div class="plaintext-content">    We got back today from a wonderful hike at Moose Hill.  We found <br/>
the first two letterboxes in great shape!  (Boulders and Hobbs Hill), <br/>
however the Moose Hill Letterbox (near the fire tower), and The Bluff <br/>
Letterbox appear to be missing.  We saw two fawns on the way back <br/>
from the Boulders Letterbox!  They just stayed there on the trail!  <br/>
Let us take their pictures!  They even crept closer!  20 minutes!  <br/>
Unbelievable!  After searching thru the posts after we got back, I <br/>
found that the one near the fire tower was reported missing.  A <br/>
little disappointed but still a great hike and a wonderful view <br/>
from "The Bluff".  The admission has gone up $1 by the way, to 4$.  <br/>
Quite the bargain.  Tons of great trails!<br/>
