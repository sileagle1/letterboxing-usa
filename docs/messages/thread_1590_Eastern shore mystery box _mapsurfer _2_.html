I get alot inquiries over the years about this box<br/>
(http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box2.html), how do I find<br/>
it, is it missing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I was there today, and so was it :-)  Looks like its been there for <br/>
almost two years now.  <br/>
<br/>
Its a tricky box both strategically and operationally; perhaps I'll<br/>
upgrade it to difficult, but its really only a mile round trip <br/>
hike, and the Eastern Shore is one of the most beautiful places in <br/>
the Mid Atlantic region, so it shouldn't matter if you don't find <br/>
the box (IMHO), so I dunno ... If you don't find it, stop in one of<br/>
wonderful historic towns for a beer on the way back (and I'm not going<br/>
to tell you which one, although ES aficionados may have a guess :-)).<br/>
Also, keep in mind that after a couple of years, leaves and the like <br/>
can build up over the hiding place (of course, if you go tomorrow, <br/>
you'll see where I disturbed its resting place ... :-))<br/>
<br/>
As to missing boxes in general,  I propose an optional protocol of <br/>
trying to contact the author off-list about potentially missing <br/>
boxes (at least hard ones) rather than cast doubt on the main list <br/>
(most inquires, if not all, about this box were off-list and it <br/>
worked great).  Of course, that might be a hassle because you<br/>
may not know the author's e-mail, just a suggestion :-)  In any <br/>
case, I hope no one puts up web pages of (rumored) missing boxes <br/>
unless confirmed directly with the author (and even then I think<br/>
web pages of missing boxes is a bad idea because it may encourage<br/>
vandalism).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Obviously, Randy makes a great argument against listing missing boxes <br/>
unless confirmed by the owner.  I would have sworn this box was <br/>
missing.  I'm pretty sure a few others would have too.  Well, I guess <br/>
it's time to get back down there...  Better get an early start :-)  <br/>
Might take all day!<br/>
<br/>
Randy, had anyone visited the box?<br/>
