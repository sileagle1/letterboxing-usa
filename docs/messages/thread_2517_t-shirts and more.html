    I would love to know how you run your letterboxing workshops with the<br/>
kids.  We are having field day at our school next week, but for some reason<br/>
this year it is kind of more like an extended special.  Only an hour and a<br/>
half of games, and not til after lunch for the kids I work with.  The<br/>
teachers are looking for other fun activities to fill the day.  I thought it<br/>
would be fun to do something related to letterboxing, since only one 4th<br/>
grader and maybe only one student in the school has heard of it.  Let me<br/>
know how it goes!  Good Luck!<br/>
