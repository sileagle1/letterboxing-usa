If you have stamped into it (or better yet, if you have it), please let me know who you sent it to- please SEND THIS INFO DIRECTLY TO ME because I don't read this list anymore. By knowing who has already gotten it and where it got sent, I can narrow down who is likely to have it. I have several people that would like to get added to it's list.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
