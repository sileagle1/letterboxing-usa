Well, cyber-ly. Following your example, we went up to York river park today,<br/>
and attempting the mattiponi trail boxes. First thing we did wrong was to<br/>
start at the wrong end of the trail. Not a good move!! My 4 yr old was bone<br/>
tired before we got done. We found the spot where the mattiponi box would<br/>
have been. Very cool spot to hide something in! We were fascinated by how<br/>
perfect it was. but we had no luck with either the pupa box or the fossil<br/>
box. It wasn't the boxes or the clues though. We chose not to go back for<br/>
fossil as we were obviously looking on the wrong side of trail, as we were<br/>
coming backwards. As for the Pupa box, well there were LOTS of trees that<br/>
fit the description of sister trees in that area. 2 likely trees that I<br/>
didn't check were because A tree had a huge black and yellow spider in it,<br/>
and B tree had either a snake or a lizard in it. I didn't get close enough<br/>
to check for legs!! I may sound like a sissy, but I like my creepy crawlers<br/>
on the ground not looking me in the eye! We had a fantastic time though. We<br/>
saw a bunch of tiny toads crossing our trail and stopped to root them on.<br/>
Even had bets on which would win. Not mine btw. We also had a rousing<br/>
conversation on who was smelling the worst (accompanied by a 10 yr old boy<br/>
you know) as we were accompanied by no less then four brightly colored<br/>
curious dragonflies, for a distance of 3 yards or so. Quite a ways for such<br/>
a short attention span! We also stopped to admire some very brightly hued<br/>
beetles. I never saw anything like them! They were electric blue, deep<br/>
emerald green, and candy apple red. I haven't downloaded the pics yet to see<br/>
if any came out. We also decided to go back next weekend to attempt the<br/>
Taskinas Creek boxes, and to rent a canoe and try our hand at that as they<br/>
are down right reasonable, and will allow us to bring the 4 yr old with us<br/>
in the boats. She has a bit of experience in them really, but we did<br/>
rowboats not canoes. All in all a great experience though we are now f - 2<br/>
tried 9. I'm so stuck on York County and Yorktown. Been having a love affair<br/>
with them for over a year now, lol! Have a great rest of your Sunday, Kerri<br/>
(Lone Pony)<br/>

Was there still a bunch of water in the hole? I guess that's why the<br/>

<br/>
I didn't get the Pupa box until my second time going to the park, AND<br/>
a friend was with me to bounce ideas off of. You're right, there are a<br/>
lot of "sister tree" combos.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry you didn't get Fossil. It was planted so recently that ya'll<br/>
probably would've been the first to stamp in! I planted that one. BTW,<br/>
it's not on the Mattaponi Trail, it's on the Woodstock Pond Trail.<br/>
Were you on the Woodstock Pond Trail when you were looking for Fossil?<br/>
<br/>
That park is a great spot for wildlife and insect viewing, as you<br/>
pointed out. Wait 'til you get the two on the Taskinas Creek Trail.<br/>
You'll see tons of herons and fiddler crabs. Last time I went, a<br/>
fellow visitor warned us about a black snake sunning itself on one of<br/>
the bridges we'd have to cross. Black snakes aren't posionous, but<br/>
still, I was glad it wasn't there when we crossed that bridge!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

  Yes. Lots with skeeter larva swimming in it. Id imagine that probably is<br/>
why the box wasnt left there. But it was still a really neat hiding place!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Well, we are planning on going back up this weekend, and now we know where<br/>
the trails go, well, kinda. We were on Woodstock pond trail but as we came<br/>
from the tail end instead of the other way, I do believe we marched off in<br/>
the wrong direction, we hunted down a bunch of pines losing their bark so we<br/>
could dig through it to find it. Imagine how embarrassed I was to be walking<br/>
around muttering, I wont leave with out it, I wont, I just plain refuse<br/>
and I look up and there are some poor parents hustling their offspring past<br/>
the crazy lady, lol!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; Taskinas Creek Trail.<br/>
<br/>
  You'll see tons of herons and fiddler crabs mlg&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Well thats a great endorsement for my son! He loves crabs, though he<br/>
usually comes out the worst for wear in any encounter!! LOL! Have a great<br/>
day!<br/>
