are also from from Southeastern CT and are psyched that there are so <br/>
many great letterboxes to find in this area.  Can't wait to find the <br/>
letterboxes you are planning on hiding!  We too are still haunted by <br/>
Ray's Dilemma, however we have found Jay's dilemma and had a lot of <br/>
fun figuring out those clues.  We are looking forward to more like <br/>
Jay's ( But not Ray's it's driving me crazy!!!)  Good luck and have <br/>
fun.<br/>
