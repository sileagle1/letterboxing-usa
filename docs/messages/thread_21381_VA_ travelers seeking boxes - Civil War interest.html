You probably already know about all the boxes in Fredericksburg and <br/>
Spotsylvania County.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also boxes in Fort Marcy in McLean and Fort Ward in <br/>
Alexandria, maybe even a mystery box.  <br/>
<br/>
I you have not already, pick up copies of the Harrison Raines <br/>
mystery novels set in the Civil War in the area, by local author <br/>
Michael Kilian: Murder at Manassas and Murder at Balls Bluff.  I <br/>
have a series of Harrison Raines boxes, one in Fort Marcy, The <br/>
Inventor, which is missing, and one in Great Falls called The <br/>
Dangerous Spy (though it is not a Civil War site).<br/>
<br/>
I have seen few people take a specific interest in the civil war <br/>
boxes around here.  I would do more of them if there were.  Write me <br/>
off list and maybe we can meet for an exchange or boxing in <br/>
Fredericksburg. <br/>
