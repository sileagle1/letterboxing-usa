couple of things along the way, thanks everyone for sharing.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it's likely that our hobby will always remain <br/>
as "obscure" as it is now. It is probable that more and more <br/>
interest will be directed toward Lb'ing ... it's too much good, <br/>
clean fun to stay "hidden away" forever.  (grin)<br/>
<br/>
So I'm wondering if there already is a Frequently Quoted Cautions <br/>
(FQC) list or if we should perhaps create one for anyone who is <br/>
approached for an interview, or is doing a group presentation, etc.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I didn't know we weren't allowed to leave anything on <br/>
national parks property. (Thanks for posting that, Cadenza)<br/>
<br/>
I'd hate to see one of us accidentally draw the wrong kind of <br/>
attention to this activity. For those looking to cause difficulity<br/>
a simple statement could be filled with reasons to do so. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; I know it's been discussed before, but just to be sure . . . A <br/>
good piece of advice is to not mention national parks in conjunction <br/>
&gt; with letterboxing since we aren't allowed to leave anything on <br/>
&gt; NPS property.  There are already a couple of maniacal (sp?) <br/>
&gt; NPS rangers out for a couple of well-known boxers--no need to <br/>
