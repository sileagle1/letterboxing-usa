and little rockin horse in the woods. As we came across the<br/>
trail we were supposed to take, a guy was sitting on the trail,<br/>
by himself, yelling. We gave hims a wide berth and continued on<br/>
our way. We found Chaney's Ranch box and were continuing on to<br/>
find the Little Rockin Horse. The clues mentioned a bunker that<br/>
may be of interest, close to where the box is hidden. As we<br/>
approached the bunker, I started to go over to check it out.<br/>
Brian stopped me and whispered in my ear "Someone is living in there"<br/>
At that moment, the same guy that we encountered earlier, literally<br/>
came crawling out of the bushes and starting talking nonsense to<br/>
us.  It was an unnerving incident, to say the least. We did feel <br/>
threatened by this man and had to kind of just walk (very quickly)<br/>
away from him.<br/>

I immediately thought of Laurette and Pam, who I know often hike alone<br/>
and would be vulnerable in a situation of this sort. <br/>

Please be careful, people. <br/>

I do almost all of my hiking alone. Pepper spray comes in all kinds <br/>
of containers that hook on to a belt loop or pack or slip into a <br/>
pocket. The devices have triggers that are intuitive to use even when <br/>
panicked. It's very inexpensive and readily available (on-line at <br/>
least) and is deliverable to most states (not NY). I generally carry <br/>
two with me...one small one, the size of an asthma inhaler, in my <br/>
pocket and a larger canister attached to my pack with velcro that is <br/>
a quick reach away. <br/>
<br/>
I also have my cell phone hot keyed to 911 and readily available to <br/>
call in an emergency. My phone also has a feature that allows it to <br/>
be located via GPS when on line with 911. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, the graphite tip on most trekking poles is sharp and <br/>
could be useful in case of an emergency. Overkill? Maybe, but better <br/>
to take these simple precautions if going solo. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, anyone who hikes alone without some effort to protect <br/>
themselves is taking too much of a risk, particularly in urban areas. <br/>
This has been said over and over on this list, but I think it's <br/>
important to trust your gut and if something looks or feels wrong,or <br/>
you find yourself getting into what I would call a "no-win" situation <br/>
whether it be an encounter with a strange person or threatening <br/>
animal, or terrain or conditions beyond your capabilities, no <br/>
letterbox is worth putting yourself in jeopardy. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was staying out of it because I hike alone sometimes too (when <br/>
Heidi's working), but you mentioned 911, which is my profession...so <br/>
now I must comment. <br/>
<br/>
Cell phone 911 is great provided you know EXACTLY where you are. <br/>
Services like cingular offer GPS enhancements but its not that easy, <br/>
because the responders need the GPS features to find you! Most of <br/>
them do NOT have GPS abilities....so what the dispatcher has is <br/>
coordinates and no way to use them.  It is still a new feature and <br/>
who knows what will develop, but don't think that GOS means we're <br/>
nescessarily going to find you.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing to do, as always, is to have a plan and stick to it. <br/>
Leave the plan with someone and tell them what time you plane to <br/>
return. If you're not back by a certain time, then they call in the <br/>
cavalry!<br/>
