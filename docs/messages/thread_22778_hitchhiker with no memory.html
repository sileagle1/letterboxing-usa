found if it wasn't already), then put it in another letterbox. Unless, of course, the log is full <br/>
or it's damaged in some way. Count it as an HH in your logbook. <br/>
<br/>
Some may differ in opinion on what should be stamped in an HH's log, but I request on all <br/>
my HHs that every box AND every carrier gets stamped into the HH log. Some don't like <br/>
the carrier to stamp in. I reckon that if it wasn't for the carrier, the HH wouldn't have <br/>
gotten anywhere.<br/>

If I find a HH that is *not* listed on Pete and Wanda's site, I email <br/>
Pete to see if it is a HH that the placer does NOT want tracked.<br/>

You would be *very surprised* at the number of placers who have <br/>

probably be a different website for this hobby, but why would anyone <br/>
place a HH that is not posted online in a letterbox that is posted? <br/>
plus on top of that, ask for those who come across the HH to report <br/>
back to them, letting them know where it is, only to not respond <br/>
back. no thanks, no nothing. i had takin in many "opinions" since <br/>
asking 1 innocent question, i give the owner of this letterbox <br/>
another week to respond. after that, i will form my own "opinion". i <br/>
enjoy letterboxing. why doesn't everyone else?<br/>

something similar. Some of my HH's are listed on Pete and Wanda's site, but<br/>
not all.. And only one of them is listed on LBNA. It never even occurred to<br/>
me to post the rest there. The one was part of a series, connected to one of<br/>
my series. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, I don't think it's a matter of why they wouldn't be posted, but more<br/>
along the lines of why would they?<br/>

<br/>
i didn't realize that letterboxing had so much drama.... all i did <br/>
was ask a simple question and it's blowing up in my face. did it not <br/>
accure to you that if no one placed thier letterboxes on the <br/>
website, there wouldn't be boxes to find. now sure, there would <br/>
probably be a different website for this hobby, but why would anyone <br/>
place a HH that is not posted online in a letterbox that is posted? <br/>
plus on top of that, ask for those who come across the HH to report <br/>
back to them, letting them know where it is, only to not respond <br/>
back. no thanks, no nothing. i had takin in many "opinions" since <br/>
asking 1 innocent question, i give the owner of this letterbox <br/>
another week to respond. after that, i will form my own "opinion". i <br/>
enjoy letterboxing. why doesn't everyone else?<br/>

<br/>
1. When I first started letterboxing, posting HHs there wasn't even an<br/>
option. It was a place to get clues, not look up boxes you already found.<br/>
<br/>
2. Pete and Wanda's page already tracked hitchhiker's progess.<br/>
Certainly didn't need LbNA to do that. (Not to mention the fact that I<br/>
preferred tracking their progress on my OWN webpages.)<br/>
<br/>
3. And now, I basically don't list them on LbNA because I have a long,<br/>
rich traditional of not posting HHs to LbNA and see no reason why that<br/>
needs to change. =)<br/>
<br/>
4. Well, that, and I stopped hiding HHs because I think there's too<br/>
many of them, as a whole. I'd rather plant boxes people can actively<br/>
search for instead of boxes they stumble upon by accident. That's just<br/>
me, though. *shrug*<br/>

We usually send an email to a HH creator when we find a HH, and also copy<br/>
