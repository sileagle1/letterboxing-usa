DIRECTIONS<br/>
<br/>
FROM INTERSTATE 287 NORTH  OR SOUTH BOUND<br/>
Interstate 287 North Bound, Exit 53, 694/511/Bloomingdale/Pompton <br/>
Lakes. Proceed to traffic light at end of ramp. Turn LEFT onto <br/>
Hamburg Turnpike. After 1.7 miles bear RIGHT onto Glenwild Ave. <br/>
Approximately 3.5 miles up the road, park at the dirt lot on the <br/>
right with the brown wooden sign that says "Welcome to West Milford <br/>
Township".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FROM ROUTE 23 SOUTH BOUND<br/>
Just past Smoke Rise in West Milford, take the High Crest Rd/Hamburg <br/>
Turnpike exit, passing under Route 23. At approximately 2 miles (just <br/>
past the Municipal Building) bear slightly LEFT uphill onto Delazier <br/>
Place (Do not make the sharp left onto Star Lake Rd). At stop sign <br/>
turn LEFT onto Glenwild Ave. Approximately 3.4 miles up the road, <br/>
park at the dirt lot on the right with the brown wooden sign that <br/>
says "Welcome to West Milford Township".<br/>
<br/>
The Stone Livingroom Letterbox<br/>
Walk back down the road for a very short distance. Look for trail <br/>
entrance on right (Park Boundary Sign on tree). Follow the blue <br/>
blazed Hewitt-Butler trail. Almost immediately the red blazed Torne <br/>
trail enters on the left. Stick with the blue trail (to the right), <br/>
which immediately ascends steeply. After 10-15 minutes of climbing <br/>
you will come to a small rock vista. Catch your breath while you <br/>
enjoy the view. Proceed on the trail. Very shortly you will come to a <br/>
very large flat rock. Where the blue trail bears right and down hill <br/>
you will need to leave the blue trail and instead take the small (5 <br/>
foot) path that you see to you left which connects to another large <br/>
rock. At the edge of this rock peer through the woods and you should <br/>
see the beginnings of what you seek. Enter the Stone Livingroom and <br/>
be amazed at your awesome discovery. <br/>
<br/>
Sit in the chair with the footstool. Where your right hand rests will <br/>
point you to the direction you need to know. Go 46 paces to a tall <br/>
knobby stump. Turn 140 degrees to the left. Go 33 paces to a large <br/>
whitish colored rock, leaning on a small flat rock. From this rock go <br/>
25 paces straight ahead to the rock with a split. Walk along (on top) <br/>
this rock, then circle around the rocks on the right. You will see a <br/>
5-foot stump (connected to another tree). From the stump, 8 paces at <br/>
160 degrees to the right, you will see a triangular nook with a brown <br/>
rock hiding what you seek.  Use a stick  just in case.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping up and returning the letterbox to its secret location, <br/>
sit and enjoy the wonder of the Stone Livingroom. Its true makers are <br/>
unknown, but we thank them for their ingenious design. When ready, <br/>
return to the blue trail. You may go in either direction. To the <br/>
right and you will retrace your steps the way you came. The more <br/>
adventurous may choose to go left. The trail becomes less traveled <br/>
but still well marked and easy to follow. After approximately 10 <br/>
minutes you will encounter a nice rocky vista from which the descent <br/>
can be rough (on your butt). At the bottom you will encounter a large <br/>
fallen tree. The trail goes left here and enters a gully. The red <br/>
Torne trail begins on the left in the gully, where the blue trail <br/>
begins a steep rocky climb to the right. After a short but steep <br/>
climb, the red trail is a lovely, fairly level walk of about 10 <br/>
minutes to its end at the blue trail. Turn right on the blue trail, <br/>
once at the road go left to return to you car. <br/>
