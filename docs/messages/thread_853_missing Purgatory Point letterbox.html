know how disappointing that can be. Sounds like you were in the right <br/>
place...and no, you don't have to replace the box yourself. We'll try <br/>
and get out there and check on both that one and on Fort Wetherill in <br/>
Jamestown, which is also reported "gone to LBNA heaven."<br/>
<br/>
And yes, we'd love to see you on a drop-in basis for the weekend <br/>
soiree in May!<br/>

&gt; HI EVERYONE,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; colin and i went to newport to do the purgatory point run.  sad <br/>
state of affairs, the 1st letterbox is missing.  i think we followed <br/>
the clues correctly, should it have been at the last observation <br/>
station, fitch or filch tower?  the rocks were all over turned and it <br/>
was a real mess.  colin and i looked around but saw neither hide nor <br/>
hair of it - he was disappointed.  what happens in an instance like <br/>
this?  should i have tried to replace it since i was there, or just <br/>
tell someone?  and who? the group in general?  and  actually this is <br/>
all contingent on the fact that we were looking in the right place <br/>
(maybe not?) anyway, please someone let me know<br/>
