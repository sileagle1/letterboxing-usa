Speaking of finding 3000 boxes so far just in CT  - that reminds me that there <br/>
must now be an awful lot of people out there reaching high PFX counts, and <br/>
some who perhaps don't even yet know about the "PFX 500 Club" we started <br/>
on a whim a few years back when there were probably not a great deal more <br/>
than 500 boxes in the whole country! (see message #7772 that goes along <br/>
with the PFX Club listing on our webpage at http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/<br/>
Letterboxes.html) Back then it required a major effort to collect that many <br/>
finds, and I remember getting seriously sneered at just for suggesting that this <br/>
might be a nice goal for people to strive for!  Now probably no one involved in <br/>
the hobby would consider that goal unreasonable or "elitist". For the past year <br/>
I've been averaging 1000 finds every 4 months, and a few other folks have <br/>
also been reaching counts of 500 in just a matter of several months. In fact, I <br/>
think that even many folks who only box occasionally would still be amazed at <br/>
how quickly the numbers add up nowadays, especially when you take into <br/>
account that you get credit for planting - like our master planters Jay Drew and <br/>
Carolyn Stearns from the "early days" - as well as for meeting people and <br/>
doing exchanges with them at gatherings and such. What could be simpler <br/>
and more fun? Just keep a running count of boxes as you find them, along <br/>
with the number of boxes you've planted and the number of exchanges you've <br/>
made, and when your combined total reaches 500, send us the date on which <br/>
you attained that goal and we will be glad to add your name to the list! Of <br/>
course, if you want to keep track of just your F's (or P's or X's), we'll be glad to <br/>
accommodate that, too! Same goes for reaching PFX 1000, 2500, etc. Just let <br/>
us know through personal e-mail, since we would probably not find out <br/>
otherwise. We don't usually have time to look at talk lists, and don't always <br/>
know what's going on in other parts of the country, so we think it will be great <br/>
fun to see when folks in other states start hitting PFX 500, too! We already <br/>
have quite a few members from southern New England, of course, and a few <br/>
from the Pacific Northwest, but we just found out that the first person we know <br/>
of to reach PFX 500 from outside these two areas was Scarab of the Doubtful <br/>
Guests from VA, who reached this goal at the Monster Mash in CT on Oct, 2, <br/>
2004. Please let us know if there are any more of you out there. We expect <br/>
that there are now a lot more names to be added of folks from CT, but we're <br/>
also hoping to start seeing names of people from OH, PA, CA, MI, WI, NY, MD <br/>
and many other states soon, too! Of course, if you don't want to keep count, <br/>
that's fine, too, but if one of the reasons some people might have for wanting <br/>
to make it appear that keeping count were somehow "beneath them" was <br/>
actually based on some secret underlying anxiety that their count might not be <br/>
as high as they might wish it to be, I would say, "go ahead and do the count <br/>
anyway, and you might find that your count is actually higher than you <br/>
expected, rather than lower! So, be brave, be bold; get out there and box, then <br/>
count it all up to experience and send us your results!  We love to see people <br/>
striving to reach goals, and hope to welcome many new members!<br/>

!P.S. Does anyone know whatever happened with the F500 box that Randy <br/>
started a couple of years ago?  We tried to get it going as a photo album of the <br/>
first couple dozen or so folks to reach F500, but haven't heard anything about <br/>
it now for over a year. Is it still circulating?  <br/>
<br/>
P.P.S, We were also wondering if anyone out there might be interested in <br/>
starting a PFX 500 box, which could go through all the members on our list in <br/>
order and then be waiting as just a little extra bit of incentive to send on to the <br/>
next person to reach that goal. Anyone feel like doing a carving for that?<br/>
