<em>The Block Island 
Vacation</em></strong></div>

<div>The <strong>Gal Pals </strong>planted a new letterbox on 
<strong>July 25, 2002 </strong>and it is located on the <strong>Clay Head Trail 
</strong>of Block Island. As stated by the <strong>Nature Conservancy </strong>, 
this trail " <strong>traverses some of the most spectacular scenery on the 
eastern seaboard</strong>. A privately owned 120 acre preserve protected by 
conservation easements, it is home to a variety of nesting birds and is one of 
the best places to observe migratory songbirds in North America in the Fall." 
</div>
<div>The Gal Pals have been coming out to Block Island for over 20 years and 
"there are over <strong>25 miles of hiking trails </strong>that are open to the 
public, free of charge, to provide everyone with the chance to enjoy the 
island's natural beauty, heritage, and wildlife." The Nature Conservancy has 
named Block Island one of the "Last Great Places" in the Western hemisphere. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Directions- </strong>To reach the trail <strong>entrance</strong>, 
look for a post marker about <strong>3.5 miles </strong>on the <strong>right 
hand side of Corn Neck Road</strong>. Turn down the dirt road and go straight 
about 1/2 mile until you reach a parking area where you will see the CLAY HEAD 
sign and information board.  Please note that mopeds are <strong>NOT 
</strong>allowed on dirt roads ( Islanders despise them) and bike riders should 
<strong>leave and lock </strong>bikes in the parking lot. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>The Hike</strong>- easy and enjoyable and the time depends on 
whether you wish to do the complete hike of the Clay Head Trail or get the 
letterbox and retrace your steps. <strong>It is recommended that you stop in at 
the Nature Conservancy and pick up a walking trail map for $1.50</strong>. It 
goes to a great cause and the folks are wonderful. <strong>You will also get an 
idea as to how long a hike you would like it to be.</strong></div>
<div>The <strong>trail runs east toward the ocean about 1/3 of a 
mile</strong>. (Here's a hint- Count your wooden planks.) You will 
<strong>pass Clay Head Swamp on your right</strong>, with scenic Littlefield 
Farm in the background. Soon you will <strong>reach an intersection </strong>in 
the trail. <strong>Turn left </strong>rather than heading toward the 
beach.  <strong>The Trail winds up above the clay bluffs</strong> for which 
the trail was named. You will spot many bank swallows who live in the bluffs 
during the summer. Take the time to stop for beautiful scenic overlooks of farm, 
pastures, beaches and ocean-it's worth it and so are you ! Continue along the 
main trail which is marked. Periodically, you will see other trails which join 
up heading away from the ocean and are unmarked. These are a part of Clay Head 
known as the "Maze". <strong>Stay on the Main Trail </strong>as it winds up and 
over the cliffs and <strong>passes through an open field on your left and dead 
tree snags throughout the background</strong>. Although tempting, do not drift 
off the Main Trail. Keep heading north. At <strong>the 4th set of wooden planks 
</strong>( we told you to count) <strong>you will see a washout area on your 
right </strong>(east). <strong>Go 6 steps due west to the pond's edge and from 
there count 6 large boulders to your left.</strong></div>
<div><strong>The Block Island Vacation Letterbox </strong>is tucked in between 
the 6th and 7th boulders. Replace carefully when stamped in as many hikers use 
this trail. </div>
<div>You may retrace your steps back or continue on down to Sachem's Pond and 
the North Light. (There is a letterbox at North Light as well.)</div>
<div>The Gal Pals love Block Island and hope you enjoy the hikes as much as we 
do. <strong>Remember to leave this beautiful treasure better</strong></div>
<div><strong>than when you entered</strong>- by this we mean that we hope you 
will <strong>respect the land </strong>and <strong>its creatures </strong>and 
<strong>pick up a piece of trash </strong>that others might have left 
<strong>and </strong>we also hope that you will <strong>leave this place a 
better person for having been here</strong>. Blessings, The Gal Pals</div>
