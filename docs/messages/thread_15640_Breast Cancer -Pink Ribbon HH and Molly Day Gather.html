past weekend (our third loss in 10 years to this terrible disease).<br/>
Because of this, we will be unable to attend the Molly Day Gather <br/>

We were hoping that if anyone can get their hands on the Pink Ribbon <br/>
HH, that they could bring it to the Molly Day Gather for us and get<br/>
the image of Ginger Looking for Molly.<br/>

If anyone has info on where the Pink Ribbon is, please contact me<br/>
