<br/>
I worked with the Washington State parks staff at Fort Worden (Port<br/>
Townsend, near Seattle) and they were helpful, encouraging, and enthusiastic<br/>
about letterboxing.   In fact, they offered suggestions about placement, and<br/>
that saved me a lot of time.<br/>
<br/>
Part of it depends upon the staff, and how much they enjoy innovative ways<br/>
to bring people to the parks.  It will also vary with past experiences with<br/>
geocaching as well as letterboxing and activities that the staff perceives<br/>
as related.  I think that mountainbiking can be a revealing subject; the<br/>
most enthusiastic parks rangers that I've met, were also mountainbikers who<br/>
could keep the risks:benefits balance in perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
