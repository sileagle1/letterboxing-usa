Saturday at 11 am in Waynesboro, VA.  Y'all have read his latest <br/>
posts so you know that he is spending a few days off trail.<br/>
<br/>
Our first order of business - Food.  We grabbed something at the <br/>
Waynesboro Wendy's, did our exchanges while we had a nice dry flat <br/>
surface, and then decided to make a pilgramage to Monticello.  We <br/>
spent a few hours taking the tour, walking the grounds and learning <br/>
all things Jeffersonian.  And who did we run into as we were getting <br/>
ready to leave?  Eileen and Bern of Celtic Pride.  They knew we were <br/>
going to Monticello and decided to drive down to join us.  What a <br/>
surprise!  So since they had just gotten there, we couldn't leave yet <br/>
and we all hiked back to the house, too impatient to wait in the <br/>
loooonnnngggg line for the shuttle.  <br/>
<br/>
Spent more time absorbing historical facts and finally, having <br/>
completely sated our appetites for Mr. Jefferson, we left Monticello <br/>
and headed to Wintergreen Resort for the 5 letterboxes planted by <br/>
BlueMoon.  The first thing we were supposed to do is pick up a trail <br/>
map at the Trillium house. Aargh - it took us so long to get there <br/>
that the map place was closed.  We had to go back to the Mountain Inn <br/>
to get a map.  Note to future finders - YOU MUST HAVE A MAP.  They <br/>
cost $3.  <br/>
<br/>
By now it is after 7 pm but we know we have at least 90 minutes of <br/>
daylight left so it should be possible to find some of the boxes.  We <br/>
were very efficient at stamping in and managed to find all 5 before <br/>
it got dark.  We found them in this order - Megan's Magpie, Maggie's <br/>
Mousie, Old Crow, Julia's Monkey and Emily's Elephant.  The trails <br/>
are great.  You should have heard us oohhing and aahhing at how prety <br/>
the trail was as we were walking to the first two boxes.  But it  <br/>
would have been embarrassing for you to hear us wheezing and gasping <br/>
as we went up some of the steep paths for the other three boxes.  All <br/>
in all - a very enjoyable search.  These boxes have not seen many <br/>
visitors and they should.  It is rather a long drive but the trails <br/>
are worth it.<br/>
<br/>
It was now getting dark and it's time for food. The only thing we <br/>
passed on the way in was a BBQ place by the BP station.  We rushed <br/>
back, mouths salivating for some pulled pork and coleslaw.  OH NO - <br/>
they closed at 8!!!!  So on to Charlottesville.  But just to make the <br/>
drive a tad more interesting, we were hit by a mighty storm.  The <br/>
windshield wipers couldn't keep up with the rain.  Finally, we found <br/>
a Ruby Tuesday just as the rain was letting up a bit so that we <br/>
didn't get completely drenched walking in.  <br/>
<br/>
I won't go into what everyone ate, although for some of us food-<br/>
oriented people, that's the most interesting topic of all.  Suffice <br/>
it to say, we ate.  We were happy.  <br/>
<br/>
Our little party didn't break up until 11.  Celtic Pride and I had to <br/>
head north and Amanda and Ryan began searching for a new hotel, <br/>
having decided that they had seen enough of the Super 8 in Waynesboro.<br/>
<br/>
So that's the story of my very long day with Amanda and Ryan.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!! Sounds like a full day!<br/>
<br/>
We just have to add our two cents being the extrememly food oriented <br/>
individuals that we are.  In full appreciation of your stomach driven <br/>
adventures -- you missed a really, really good restaurant at the bottom of <br/>
Wintergreen -- Bistro something!  (not it's official name although Bistro is <br/>
in the title -- I think the second part is a number)  Anywhoooo   it is very <br/>
yummy!<br/>
<br/>
Once we discovered it (the food on the mountain isn't that hot except for <br/>
one salad at the golf club with pears, gorganzola and balsamic vinegrette -- <br/>
the kids could give you the low down on the chicken nuggets situation for <br/>
the greater mountain area...) we ate at that Bistro twice for lunch and once <br/>
for dinner.  Did I mention we were only there for an extended weekend?...<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, our first day there, we thought we were going to lose our brakes <br/>
going down the mountain, thus careening around the killer curves at greater <br/>
and greater speeds, holding on to eachother for dear life as we finally flew <br/>
out over the tree tops...  I say luckily for two reasons:  One, because this <br/>
didn't happen (obviously, although Pandora, being the amazing mountain woman <br/>
that she was forced to become would have probably limped out of the wreckage <br/>
and found her way back {said with love and admiration}.  We were told, in a <br/>
very nice way by the service station at the bottom of the mountain, that we <br/>
were just another in a long line of pathetic tourist families who are not <br/>
used to actually really using their brakes on such steep descents and thus <br/>
are freaked out by the smell of the burning brake material -- which is <br/>
apparently to be expected, none the less the reason we will be trading the <br/>
Explorer in soon....  Anyway, I digress, it was lucky too (and probably <br/>
almost as importantly as not perishing off the side of the cliff)  'cause, <br/>
while we were waiting for the service station to examine the car, we had no <br/>
choice but to use up an hour or two within walking distance of the gas <br/>
station.  Lo and behold, a restaurant across the street.  Run those kiddies <br/>
accross the highway (slight exageration on my part).  And, that is how we <br/>
discovered the Bistro place whose name is not as memorable as its super <br/>
yummy food!  Wow, I'm getting hungry just writing about it!  What's in the <br/>
fridge?  oooooh  some great fudge from the OBX (we devoured the fantastic <br/>
Kill Devil coconut custard before we headed home -- have to leave that <br/>
rental fridge clean....)  But, that is another story....<br/>
<br/>
Just also have to mention that Wintergreen is the first place the BeMa <br/>
family actually hiked (or took any type of walk in the woods since those <br/>
streaking days at summer camp...)  We consider it the quasi official start <br/>
of our letterboxing days although we didn't know at the time that there were <br/>
any boxes there (doh!...) But, it is what gave us the impetus (big word -- <br/>
told you we were more intellectual than physical....) to pull out that <br/>
letterboxing article in The Post and the rest is history (or at least <br/>
emailed in excrutiating details in earlier posts!...)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you all had fun!  We're jealous you got to meet Ryan and Amanda!  <br/>
Hoping that Harper's Ferry will somehow still come to be!  BeMa<br/>
