                    <html><body>I went looking for the Two Squirrels Greenbelt Park letterboxes today.  Could only find one!<br/>
<br/>
Had no trouble finding Greenbelt #1 box.  It has some minor water damage.  Lots of people have found it recently.  <br/>
<br/>
Then went to look for the Maple Leaf box.  No luck.  I found the Robinson Tree and the RG tree, but then couldn't find the box.  I looked under every twin tree I could find!<br/>
Did find a pair of reading glasses in the middle of the woods - did any letterboxer lose a pair??  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Was wondering if any of the people who found Greenbelt #1 this past weekend had any luck finding Maple Leaf.  Maybe it was just me!<br/>
<br/>
Also hid another box in Columbia, MD today.  Clues to follow!<br/>
