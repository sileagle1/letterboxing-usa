The art for this stamp was drawn by Elizabeth a 6th grader at the <br/>

Directions<br/>
	Head towards the Amphitheater, and down the path on the  <br/>
        left.  You will see a tree in the middle of the path you are<br/>
        in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>
	Keep going past the bathrooms on the left.<br/>
<br/>
	Pass the wooden bridge on the right.<br/>
<br/>
	Look for a brown park sign on the left, just before the<br/>
        trail heads up a steep hill.<br/>
<br/>
       At the second large tree on the left of the path after the<br/>
        park sign   Stop<br/>
<br/>
	Take a baring of 74 degrees <br/>
<br/>
	15 steps up the hill from the trail leads you to a large tree<br/>
        Behind the tree under a rock, sticks, and bark is what<br/>
        you seek.<br/>
<br/>
	Trail get very busy please rehide well.<br/>
