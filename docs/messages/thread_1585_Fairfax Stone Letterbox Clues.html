Yo Squirrels-
<br/>    You sure have been hiding away your nuts for the
winter! I'm looking forward to returning to WVA.

A long time ago Lord Fairfax followed the Potomac River to its origin and <br/>
there he placed a large stone marking the event. Your search begins at that <br/>
stone. From the parking lot go to the stone and cross the Potomac River. You <br/>
made need a life jacket, but then again, you may not. Cross the field to <br/>
where the fence ends. Take the trail up a slight hill and cross another <br/>
field. At this point you are crossing a reclaimed strip mine. Under the soil <br/>
and grass there is coal. Go thru the center of the field to the crest of the <br/>
field and look to your right for a ditch. Go to that ditch and look around in <br/>
the slate for some very cool fern fossils. Very nice stuff. When you have <br/>
your fill of plant fossils, (leave some for others) return the way you came. <br/>
As you go back down the hill into the woods look to your left for some trees. <br/>
The letterbox is at the base of one of those near the trail. Good luck!<br/>
