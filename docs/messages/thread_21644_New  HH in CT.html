What better way to celebrate my first year of Letterboxing than by <br/>
making another letterbox?  <br/>
"My 1st Anniversary of Letterboxing" Hitchiker has been placed in <br/>
the FIRST letterbox that I found one year ago yesterday, and in <br/>
going against Letterboxing "rules"...gasp...I'm going to TELL where <br/>
it is, so that maybe it can start the celebrations sooner!!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You can find it in Ansonia, CT in one of the Letterboxes at the <br/>
Nature Center...<br/>
<br/>
My thanks to Letterboxer2002, my first Letterboxing mentor - it was <br/>
his super 'boxes that were located so closeby and his encouragement <br/>
that got me hooked in a hurry! <br/>
My other mentors are Sadie and Russ, the first Letterboxers I met on <br/>
the trail a few days after I started.  Since then, whether they <br/>
realize it or not, they have taught me so much about Letterboxing, <br/>
my particular favorite aspect being "the art of the Bonus Box"!<br/>
Last but not least, my thanks to ALL Letterboxers out there who have <br/>
made this hobby so enjoyable for me!<br/>
...happy 'boxing everyone!<br/>

Congratulations on your ist LB anniversary! I was so excited to hear about your HH in Ansonia that I had to resist the urge to get in bed last night with my hiking boots on. However, I did hop up at the break of dawn this morning.... put on the boots..... and head out at 7:00 a.m. to find these LBs and your First Anniversary Hitchhiker! Success!! I was so honored to be the FF for your HH. Great stamp! I am pleased to announce that as I write this, your HH is on its way to Texas for a little tour of the Lone Star State before heading on to.... where ever?  I will be interested to hear of it's travels. Also, for other CT LBers: this is a great series (the Ansonia Nature Center). There were lots of songbirds this morning and I saw 5 deer cross the trail in front of me.<br/>
