This is our 2nd Shieling Forest Letterbox (the 3rd one placed there). 
It's dedicated to our daughter, Emma, who came home to us on May 5, 2000
and it was placed on this 1st year anniversary.
<p>The clues and name really have nothing to do with the stamp, but here
goes:
</p><p>CINCO D'EMMA MAIJA LETTERBOX
</p><p>LOCATION:  Shieling Forest, Peterborough, NH
<br/>DIRECTIONS:  From Route 202 in Peterborough, NH go up Old Street
Road, past the hospital and Shieling Forest will be about 1/4 mile south
on the left.
</p><p>CLUE DIFFICULTY:  Moderate
<br/>TERRAIN:  Easy-Moderate (walk in the woods)
<br/>ESTABLISHED:  May 5, 2001
<br/>AUTHOR:  Nisa and Eric Simila

</p><p><b>Two lovers</b> <b>carved</b> their promise in tall <b>wood</b>
<br/>And sealed it with a <b>knot;</b>
<br/>They trysted by a <b>rocky cave</b>
<br/>In fear of being caught.
</p><p>The lovers were discovered in time
<br/>And the two were wrenched <b>apart.</b>
<br/>Now beneath the <b>rock</b> that severs them,
<br/>Lies the t<b>reasure</b> of their one heart.
</p><p><b>additional clues:</b>  eastern side of the Ridge; 2, 12, 90;
north by northwest and up
