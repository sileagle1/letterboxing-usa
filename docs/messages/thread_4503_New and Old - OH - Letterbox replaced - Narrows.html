<br/>
The old box location, known as "The Narrows" on the geocache pages <br/>
and as "Little Miami Respite" on the letterboxing pages was popular <br/>
enough that a bit of a worn down trail was being formed from the main <br/>
trail to the box.  That is too much of a good thing.  <br/>
<br/>
I have moved the box and written new clues for both the geocaching <br/>
community and the letterboxing community.  I have marked the old <br/>
clues for both communities as being permanently retired.<br/>

The clues for letterboxing are at <br/>
