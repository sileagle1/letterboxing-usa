I picked up The Grey Owl HH this weekend at Le Papillion Bleu and it <br/>
is now even closer to NYC, residing in a LB in the Charlestown <br/>
vicinity.<br/>

&gt; There is a Thumbin' Critter awaiting a ride in your state! Grey Owl <br/>
&gt; was last dropped off at Le Papillion Bleu letterbox in Peacedale, <br/>
RI. <br/>
&gt; According to Mapquest, she's approximately 162 miles from the <br/>
finish <br/>
&gt; line!!! She running neck and neck with another Thumbin' Critter, <br/>
&gt; Black Bat, who is currently in the arms of a letterboxer somewhere <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; Pennsylvania, approximately 170 miles from the finish line! For <br/>
