what better way to celebrate someone's life than to<br/>
get out in the beauty of nature?<br/>
<br/>
My second plant, Lillypad, was in memory of my inlaws.<br/>
 The park that it's planted in was the place they met,<br/>
and continued to vacation in every year until my FIL's<br/>
death 10 years ago.  My husband has fond memories of<br/>
the park, and whenever we go up to do box maintenence,<br/>
he ends up talking about the happy memories he had<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
It's a healing process for him, and a chance for<br/>
others to see the beauty that so touched our family<br/>
for so many years.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I sound so sappy ... but Memorial boxes are<br/>
definately a plus in my humble opinion.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I planted a letterbox along a trail that had a bridge that was built <br/>
on the trail as a memorial. I used the bridge in my clue. The <br/>
gentleman's widow and daughter were doing a google search of their <br/>
family name and found my letterbox clue that mentioned the bridge. <br/>
They were so happy to have the letterbox along the trail and were <br/>
introduced to letterboxing through my box.<br/>
I had planted the box, so that people would visit that area. The <br/>
family of this man also wanted people to visit and enjoy an area that <br/>
he had enjoyed. So I think Memorial boxes are a good thing! Just as <br/>
people put up memorial benches and bridges in parks, a letterbox is <br/>
just another form of expression.<br/>
