on LBNA.  That letterboxer only has one box listed.  As for why?  I like <br/>
the ideas about Winchendon and the Flat Rock Sanctuary.  The box could <br/>
have a deeper meaning.<br/>
<br/>
If I find this box and it has a stash of PZ Kut located nearby, I'll <br/>
have a slight guess at the identity of the placer, but beyond <br/>
that....geesh, I have no clue.<br/>
<br/>
I believe if we are to have a chance at the County in the next shot, we <br/>
might as well inquire as to whether it is located in Worcester.  Or <br/>
possibly a variation, such as, "Does the box exist in a county that <br/>
shares it's name with one of its communities?"  But this may just about <br/>
yield the same information as asking if the box is in Middlesex county.<br/>
<br/>
Well, all I can say for sure is this; The placer is most likely enjoying <br/>
our discussions back and forth.  It seems that this kind of discussion <br/>
is exactly what is meant by it's creation.<br/>
<br/>
Blax<br/>
who's really enjoying this mystery<br/>

I would bet they have a lot more than one plant out there under thier regular trail name. I though it was a pretty cool name to use for this game. <br/>

whether that question at this time would yield anything substantive.<br/>
<br/>
How is the term urban used?  I know that some areas of a city that would <br/>
be considered urban could pass for suburban.  Could the term "urban" be <br/>
substituted with "city".  I would also imagine, in my head anyways, that <br/>
a question of whether it is in a park or not would yield similar results <br/>
as whether it was in Worcester County.  It would only confirm or deny a <br/>
particular area or location, similar to Boston Rott's ideas.  In fact, I <br/>
think that any question that substantially narrows the field, would be <br/>
reasonable.<br/>

Libraries, I agree, would "not be prudent at this juncture" (borrowed <br/>
phrase), although....... if you asked if it was in a town with a library <br/>

This may be a shot in the dark, but from the very beginning I had a <br/>

be true).  I only think this because of the "Flamingo Caper of 2005" <br/>
which was held here last year.  It was a very creative twist to <br/>
letterboxing.  The 20Q letterboxing game seems to be along the same <br/>
lines of creativity.<br/>

I'd love to ask "Is the box in Leominster, or in any city or town <br/>
bordering Leominster", but I'm too scared to waste a question!<br/>

The lazy letterboxer here! I have been following this thread with great interest. Let me say, honestly, that I do not have anything to do with this nor do I know who ephemeralletterboxer is, although I do have my suspicions. As much as I would love to think that the box is in Leominster, I really don't think it is.<br/>

  So far we have been taking a conservative approach to our questions. Each of the questions, for the most part have eliminated approximately half of the remaining population (low risk, low rewards).

I searched for Flat Rock and Massachusetts and I came up with a hit that talked about a Solstice Rock in Boxborough. The Summer Solstice occurs on June 21 or 22 sometime so this may be a little late for that but it is a possibility. <br/>

This page also talks about two rock mounds that form a turtle shape. I know of a letterboxer (who I considered as being behind all this) near that area that has turtle elements in their clues and trail name. Could it be a coincidence?<br/>

I was wondering the same thing but came up with nothing. But after I did a<br/>
different type search I came up with something fairly close by accident.<br/>
<br/>
I searched for Flat Rock and Massachusetts and I came up with a hit that<br/>
talked about a Solstice Rock in Boxborough. The Summer Solstice occurs on<br/>
June 21 or 22 sometime so this may be a little late for that but it is a<br/>
possibility. <br/>
<br/>

org/salem/solstice%2Drock/<br/>
<br/>
This page also talks about two rock mounds that form a turtle shape. I know<br/>
of a letterboxer (who I considered as being behind all this) near that area<br/>
that has turtle elements in their clues and trail name. Could it be a<br/>
coincidence?<br/>

&gt; I agree.  Good observation about the captialization, which would <br/>
&gt; also support my Leominster theory (the lazy letterboxer).  I think <br/>
&gt; I'm going to go with my hunch and ask the Leominster question.  With <br/>
&gt; it being random, there's only a small chance of it being picked <br/>
&gt; anyway.  If I'm wrong - I apologize now! <br/>
