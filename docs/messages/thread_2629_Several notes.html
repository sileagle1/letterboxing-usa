dry book.  I copied the I.D.'s of all those who stamped in previously <br/>
and have put it in the same place. Hope no one missed it while it was <br/>
out. <br/>
<br/>
   Grist in the Mist  has a new book  the first was soaked . I <br/>
believe the cover must have been left open at some point this spring. <br/>
<br/>
For the collector of stats 53 people checked into book one of Grist <br/>
in the Mist in a 9 month span from  sept - june . . There were also <br/>
two  hitchhikers, Airstream and  Churchill in America. <br/>
<br/>
Have a great letterboxing weekend. Leader of the Pack <br/>
