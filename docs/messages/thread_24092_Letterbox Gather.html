that "The One In Tenn. Letterbox Gather" in Nashville, TN is coming up <br/>
this spring. The date on this event is March 17th. It is St. Patty's <br/>
Day. There are several event stamps (including the official event stamp <br/>
that will travel afterwards), lots of PT's, 20 or more traditional <br/>
boxes, and several St. Patrick's Day boxes. It is not going to be <br/>
anything fancy; no bells or whistles, justa place for boxers to gather <br/>
and exchange. The only requirment is that you sign up on the AQ <br/>
website. There are going to be geocachers present to help us learn more <br/>
about that hobby and hopefully so they can learn more about <br/>
letterboxing. The Metro parks director is inviting some of her friends <br/>
who are geocachers. In order to keep the numbers at a reasonable level, <br/>
we ask that those who plan to attend sign up on AQ so that we can make <br/>
ssure we have clues especially for you. Those not signed up will not <br/>
have a clue package, and there will not be spares.<br/>
