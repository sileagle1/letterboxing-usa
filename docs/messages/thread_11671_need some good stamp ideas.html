                    <div class="plaintext-content">How can you be out of ideas?  There are thousands of things to carve!  <br/>
Alot of people like to carve series.  You could pick a theme and carve <br/>
related stamps.  For instance, I just found a Scooby-Doo series which <br/>
had the carved faces of 5 cartoon characters. I've also found a <br/>
Carnival series - each stamp was a different carnival thing like a <br/>
ferris wheel, a carousel horse, a box of popcorn.  Someone did a 21 <br/>
box series on musicals.  A group in Richmond is doing the whole Clue <br/>
game.  Someone in New England is doing all the characters in Alice in <br/>
Wonderland.  Other people are doing all the presidents and all the <br/>
state quarters.  The series doesn't have to be large - I did a three <br/>
stamp sport series that I put in three different parks.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want to do a series, there are even more things to carve.  <br/>
<br/>
You don't have to draw the pictures - just get the images from Google <br/>
and transfer them to the rubber.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I passed through Charlotte during the past weekend and picked up <br/>
your Visitor box on 3/28 and your Big Foot box on 3/31.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and thanks for the boxes!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's nice to have the stamp tie in with the place that you hide it. <br/>
It you are going to hide the stamp on Pine Tree Trail, a Pine Tree or <br/>
a Pine Cone image. <br/>
If you are hiding a stamp at a park with a lake, an image of a boat <br/>
or fish.<br/>
I get inspiration from Park names and trail names. Research the <br/>
history of your area. I have a Lewis and Clark series of stamps. What <br/>
are the Images of Your State? The state Bird, State Tree, State <br/>
Flower?<br/>
What are your favorite cartoon characters? <br/>
Ihave seen stamps of Snoopy and Mickey Mouse.<br/>
Or your favorite books?<br/>
There is a Harry Potter series in Conn. Dead Authors in VA. <br/>
 favorite movies? I have done letterboxes for An Officer and a <br/>
Gentleman, Citizen Kane, Star Trek and James Bond.<br/>
 Has anyone done an Indiana Jones series yet?<br/>
What are your other hobbies? People who quilt make stamps of quilts, <br/>
people who snowski do stamps of skis and ski lifts and mountains, <br/>
people who enjoy nascar make stamps of cars and the numbers of their <br/>
favorite racers. Folks who ride horses make stamps of horses, <br/>
horseshoes, saddles, cowboy boots and cowboy hats.<br/>
What are your favorite foods? You can do a salad series. A head of <br/>
lettuce, a tomato, a stalk of celery, a bottle of salad dressing.<br/>
<br/>
Use your imagination and things that YOU like and enjoy!<br/>
