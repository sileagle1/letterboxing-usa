                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok. I've read all the posts on this one and here's my two cents then I'll let it go. I am the following: a wife, a sister, a daughter, a friend, a stage manager, a dog walker, a cat lover, a hedgehog lover and a solitary pagan. But most important, to this list anyway, my husband and I are letterboxers! We're new to the hobby and enjoy it immensely. We've taken some wonderful hikes together. Finding a box during this hike is a bonus. It gives us time together. Sometimes we talk, sometimes we just admire the view. So I guess that what I'm getting at is that we may be different people with different views but we all enjoy this hobby! So let's stop with political, religious, etc. baggage and get out there and box! <br/>
