<div><em>I concur with the note, I was unable to locate 
the second box, and therefore it may very well be missing. The firetower box is 
alive and well.</em></div>

<div><strong>Tribal Nation</strong></div>
<div><em>Two boxes in good shape, great hike, nice 
climb, totally unexpected sheer cliffs. By the way I checked out the PANIC route 
and decided that I am too old for such risks. :-}</em></div>

<div><strong>Fowler-Grindstone</strong></div>
<div><em>All three boxes have been visited by a lot of 
boxers. FYI, the pink blazes on the near side of the brook seem to have 
disappeared. Listen for the sound of the brook when you reach the old logging 
road and bushwhack over to the stone dam. The blazes are still on the far side. 
I also loved parking in that guys driveway!</em></div>

<div><em>This has to be rated a premier location. We 
would have hiked back the same way after the second box, but YIMS saw one too 
many snake. The forest ranger found us stamping in and lo and behold, he knew 
all about letterboxing, Dartmoor and everything.</em></div>

<div><em>Quickest multi letter degrees I ever got. Great 
gardens, and at this time of year no students to be wary of while stamping 
in.</em></div>
