     The design belongs to Mitch Klink (Der Mad Stamper) in Oregon. <br/>
Mitch is also the designer of our new website - a very talented guy. <br/>
It is to your credit that you recognized the work of an artist and <br/>
stepped back from using the image without permission.  I imagine a <br/>
T-shirt offer may be possible at some time (soon?) and it seems <br/>
logical to consider a group member as the supplier.  Thanks for the <br/>
offer.  If you see shirt noises happening and someone has appeared to <br/>
have forgotten you PLEASE speak up in a post to the Webmasters. <br/>
Forgetfulness is a blight upon progress and we seem to commit our <br/>
share of omissions.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
Susan<br/>

Ya know I was all ready to retire into obscurity for a while, but I <br/>
really can't resist commenting on the irony of such an enthusiastic <br/>
response to the idea of commercial letterboxing merchandise. This is <br/>
exactly the issue that brought me _huge_ amounts of grief from <br/>
letterboxing "founders" when I proposed such ideas to  to help pay <br/>
the bills for the services I was trying to develop for letterboxers <br/>
years ago. You have an email list that exists for free because Yahoo <br/>
places adds in all the postings. Now you are now supporting the sale <br/>
of letterboxing merchandise (prior patches aside) for what reason I <br/>
don't know, except to possibly help pay bills for a site I previously <br/>
offered host for free with no strings attached last year.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with Steve's suggestion, it is the enthusiastic <br/>
support of Susan's posting. Contrary to what might appear to be the <br/>
case, I do not revel in instigating conflict. However the <br/>
inconsistency is unbelievable to me. I do not know if other <br/>
webmasters now support the sale of commercial letterboxing <br/>
merchandise but it would be quite a turn about. I have a whole email <br/>
archive of the postings from the prior letterboxing talk list in <br/>
which I was called about every name in the book for such ideas. <br/>
Personally I have always thought such ideas were a great potential <br/>
sources of revenue to help offset the cost of providing free <br/>
resources to letterboxers.<br/>

Good point, Susan.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps now is a good time to re-evaluate Eric's offer to host the<br/>
site for free, using PHP and database technologies, without some of<br/>
the baggage from three years ago that had prevented this discussion <br/>
in the past, in the interest of moving forward.<br/>
<br/>
I still fail to see how Eric's offer doesn't address the financial<br/>
issues, at least.  Am I missing something?  I fail to see how the<br/>
offer is not "positive", especially given the problems with hispeed<br/>
technologies.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, I'm _truly not_ trying to stir up the pot either.  Believe<br/>
me if you can.  I am sick of it.  Yet I believe it is a valid question, <br/>
and one that can be discussed without rancor.  If this is an inappropriate <br/>
forum, I've suggested others.  There is even the old letterbox-technical <br/>
list at Yahoogroups.  I think all that Eric wants is an answer from the<br/>
group as to why not, when the offer has so much positive potential.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that "it seems logical to consider a group member as the <br/>
supplier" on this issue as well, rather than hispeed technologies.<br/>
<br/>
Submitted without rancor.  If we truly wish to "move forward" without<br/>
the baggage of the past, lets do so, and Eric's offer perhaps is a good<br/>
place to start, in light of the technical and financial issues.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

    in my opinion, you just chose to dredge up some stuff after<br/>
suggesting that moving forward was a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Please desist, I don't have any more energy for this topic.<br/>
