                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned home from a business trip (yeah, right!) from the<br/>
heartland of America. I had to add a couple of days to my stay just to<br/>
devote to letterboxing. All the boxes I searched for and all the ones<br/>
I hid there last year were in place. The following boxes are in good<br/>
health: IA- Iowa Image, the Masked Bandit; NE- Snowflake, Inferno, <br/>
Sunshine, Letterboxing Nebraska, Elmwood Park, Portal, Son of<br/>
Cornhusker, East Meets West, Bellevue Loop, Pappillon, Prairie Dreams.<br/>
For more information on the NE boxes vist:<br/>

<br/>
I also was lucky enough to meet up with Omaha letterboxer (and<br/>
bonafide interesting person) Scott Redd for an all-too-short lunch. I<br/>
felt like a visiting dignitary when he and his family showered me with<br/>
cool gifts. In my wake, I left two and a half new letterboxes in the<br/>
Omaha area. The plane trip home was the perfect time to write the<br/>
clues which will soon follow onlist. The Texas Traveler hitch hiker<br/>
rode with me at the beginning of my trip but is now waiting for a new<br/>
ride in Omaha.<br/>
<br/>
For those who have never visited Iowa or Nebraska: this place is NOT<br/>
flat. There is good food, not to mention Krispy Kreme donuts. There<br/>
are tons of trees and there is a budding community of talented<br/>
letterboxers. For a mental challenge, take a look at Steve's clues on<br/>
the Letterboxing Nebraska website. This guy writes some of the best<br/>
I've seen. Funhog<br/>
