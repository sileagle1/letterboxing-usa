weekend.  It is currently seeded with 5 HHs, but has room for PLENTY <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Located just off the junction of highways 101 &amp; 152 we hope it sees <br/>
plenty of use during the summer travel season.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike many HHHs there is no "take one/leave one" requirement for <br/>
this Hostel.  We wanted to encourage our visiting HHs to travel, so <br/>
feel free to pick up one or more even if you don't have any to leave <br/>
behind.  Or if you've picked up a few on your journey, feel free to <br/>
leave them all here in confidence that they will not rest too long!<br/>
All we ask is that there always be at least one HH left in the box <br/>
for the next visitor.<br/>
<br/>
The Hostel is located behind the counter in the You Got Memories <br/>
scrapbooking store, which is a place we visitat least once a week, <br/>
so it should be well maintained.  We also intend to keep it well <br/>
stocked with hitchhikers ourselves as we are both starting HH series.<br/>
<br/>
