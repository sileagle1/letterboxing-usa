planted by Rubaduc 8-30-02<br/>
difficulty: easy maybe 1 mile round trip.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: take exit 8 off Rt. 91 North, go East on Rt. 131 to first<br/>
traffic light, turn left onto 44-a. At the end of this road turn left<br/>
onto Rt. 44 West and in a couple of miles (in Brownsville center) turn<br/>
right onto Brownsville/Hartland Rd. Drive past the Story Memorial, the<br/>
white church and the elementary school to park on the right side of the<br/>
road before the first driveway of the cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
Walk down the driveway between the two Pierce headstones to the next to<br/>
the last row, look to your left to see the stone with the lighthouse<br/>
which this letterbox was named for. Continue to the end of the drive and<br/>
turn right, walking towards Mt. Ascutney and go down a very steep incline<br/>
onto a gravel track at the school (using discretion when school is in<br/>
progress). Turn left on the track, past a log bench and when the track<br/>
turns sharply right, take an overgrown path on the left. This may be a<br/>
snowmobile trail as the wooden bridge you soon cross would indicate.<br/>
After crossing the bridge this path goes into the woods and up a steep<br/>
hill, coming out onto a dirt road where you turn left and once again go<br/>
uphill.<br/>
When the road turn sharply left, you will see a stone wall on the right.<br/>
Follow this wall into the woods and up a hill, as the hill levels out and<br/>
you see gaps in the wall, veer to your left and start looking for a stone<br/>
building surrounded by a black iron fence. This is a mausoleum, final<br/>
resting place of  Daniel Leavens Cady, local Vermont Poet.<br/>
Enjoy the site, read the bronze plaque on the ground in front of the door<br/>
and then with your back to the door look for a clump of oak and pine<br/>
trees at 230 degrees, the final resting place of the Brownsville<br/>
Lighthouse Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
This piece of land was purchased from my grandfather by Daniel Cady for<br/>
the purpose of resting in peace on a hill above Brownsville. He also left<br/>
funds for perpetual care but on this visit his plot was overgrown with<br/>
weeds and the plaque was barely visible.<br/>
<br/>
Follow your path back to your car and thank you for visiting.<br/>
