workshops?<br/>
<br/>
I've decided I need all the help I can get, and I think this gathering<br/>
will be just the place to get it!  If I wait until Friday night to write<br/>
checks to put gas in my car and get a compass and food for the potluck,<br/>
I should be safe.  Sunday is payday and it's on direct deposit!  <br/>
<br/>
The Woof Pack went to Duncan Woods today.  We were 1 for 4, and left<br/>
exhausted, and frustrated!  My $200 GPS is worthless under tree cover.<br/>
Duh!  I KNEW that I just didn't know HOW worthless!  I think that was my<br/>
biggest problem, but I may not be interpreting clues correctly either.<br/>
And maybe I just need a little more patience and perseverance.  <br/>
<br/>
Now if I can just follow the directions to the site of the gathering!<br/>
<br/>
We did find Mirror Mirror - cute stamp!<br/>
<br/>
SpringChick, how old are you?  Are you some kind of marathon runner?  My<br/>
lungs are foaming from hiking those dunes!  This sport might finish me<br/>
off!  This is the first I've gotten out in nature hunting LB's.  If I<br/>
didn't desperately need the exercise, I'd probably give up now!  The<br/>
other 2 members of The Woof Pack are zonked out big time.  I don't think<br/>
they're even concerned about dinner tonight!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Also there are still plenty of spaces left for both the carving workshop<br/>
and the log books workshop, so if you are interested in either/both of<br/>
these and haven't registered yet, please do so soon.<br/>
<br/>
