<p>I don't know who the author is, or if it was a printed article, 
but it's a <br/>nice story about America. </p>
<p>&gt;&gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; This was forwarded 
to me this morning...Just wanted to pass it along. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;You might find this tribute hits home about who we as 
Americans are: <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Â  TRIBUTE 
TO THE UNITED STATES <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This, from a 
Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; America: The Good Neighbor. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
Widespread but only partial news coverage was given <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast 
from <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, 
a Canadian television <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
Commentator. What follows is the full text of his <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; trenchant remarks as printed in the 
Congressional <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Record:
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; "This Canadian thinks it is time to 
speak up for the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Americans as the 
most generous and possibly the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
least appreciated people on all the earth. Germany, <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and 
Italy <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; were lifted out of the 
debris of war by the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Americans 
who poured in billions of dollars and <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; forgave other billions in debts. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; None of these countries is 
today paying even the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; interest on 
its remaining debts to the United <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
States. When France was in danger of collapsing in <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, 
and <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; their reward was to be 
insulted and swindled on the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When earthquakes hit 
distant cities, it is the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; United 
States that hurries in to help. This spring, <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 59 American communities were flattened by 
tornadoes. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody helped. The 
Marshall Plan and the Truman <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
Policy pumped billions of dollars into discouraged <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; countries. Now newspapers in those countries 
are <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; writing about the decadent, 
warmongering Americans. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;
<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to see just one of those 
countries that is <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; gloating over 
the erosion of the United States <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
dollar build its own airplane. Does any other <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; country in the world have a plane to equal 
the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Boeing Jumbo Jet, the 
Lockheed Tri-Star, or the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Douglas 
DC10? <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all 
the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; International lines except 
Russia fly American <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; planes? Why 
does no other land on earth even <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
consider putting a man or woman on the moon? You <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get 
radios. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You talk about German 
technocracy, and you get <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
automobiles. You talk about American technocracy, <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and you find men on the moon - not once, but 
several <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; times - and safely home 
again. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You talk about scandals, and the Americans 
put <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; theirs right in the store 
window for everybody to <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; look at. 
Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; and hounded. They are here on our streets, and most <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, 
are <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; getting American dollars from 
ma and pa at home to <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; spend 
here. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; When the railways of 
France, Germany and India were <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
breaking down through age, it was the Americans who <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and 
the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; New York Central went broke, 
nobody loaned them an <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; old 
caboose. Both are still broke. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; 
&gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I can name you 5000 times 
when the Americans raced <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to the 
help of other people in trouble. Can you name <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; me even one time when someone else raced to 
the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Americans in trouble? I don't 
think there was <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; outside help even 
during the San Francisco <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
earthquake. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Our 
neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; kicked around. They will come out of this 
thing <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with their flag high. And 
when they do, they are <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; entitled 
to thumb their nose at the lands that are <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is not one of those." <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;! <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 
Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!! <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; This is one of the best editorials that I have ever <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; read regarding the United States. It is nice 
that <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one man realizes it. I only 
wish that the rest of <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the world 
would realize it. We are always blamed for <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; everything, and never even get a thank you for the <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; things we do. <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I would hope that each 
of you would send this to as <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; many 
people as you can and emphasize that they <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt; &gt; should send it to as many of their friends until <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this letter is sent to every person on the web. I 
am <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; just a single American that 
has read this, TRIBUTE TO <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; THE 
UNITED STATES <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>&gt;&gt;
