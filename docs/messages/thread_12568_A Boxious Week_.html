                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know its only Sat. however I've had a great week of boxing!  I was able to <br/>
get out there four days out of six, which is pretty good considering that it <br/>
was supposed to rain a good portion of the week!  I probably could have <br/>
gotten out on Monday and Friday, if I didn't have to work on a term paper and <br/>
mow my lawn!<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday brought me grad class, which means that I was able to visit the New <br/>
Britain General Hospital... but I'm OK!  Actually, I found the NBGH letterbox <br/>
in Walnut Park!  Happily, I was the first to stamp in!  I would have found it <br/>
on Monday (since I was right down the street at Great Taste), but I hadn't <br/>
gotten the e-mail with the clues yet!<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday brought a "Dead Bug".  I'm not sure that it is legal to go through <br/>
those teeth, but found the box anyway.  I just barely squeezed through....  <br/>
Too bad that I had rehearsal that evening, or I would have found others in <br/>
the area..... <br/>
<br/>
Thursday brought a surprisingly good day!  Surprising since it was supposed <br/>
to rain!  I was able to get out to Vernon to grab the Rails to Trails series. <br/>
 I tried for Rockville Spur, however it was missing, and since replaced!  <br/>
(Fast work Bill and Craig!)  Hopefully, I will find it sometime soon!<br/>
<br/>
Friday brought lawn mowing....  I had been waiting for my dad to switch lawn <br/>
mowers with me, and he hadn't done so thus far, so I didn't have a working <br/>
lawnmower.  I told myself that if the lawnmower hadn't been switched, or I <br/>
was unable to get the old one running, that I would get out for some <br/>
boxing.... To my dismay, Dad switched the lawn mowers first thing this <br/>
morning on his way to work.... which means that I had to mow the lawn..... <br/>
sigh....<br/>
<br/>
Sat. proved to be a fruitful day!  I met up with Butterfly and Bluebird in <br/>
Danielson and found Silly Siblings, Louisiana Quarter Stamp, North Carolina <br/>
Quarter Stamp, The Baseball LB, Haunted Trails LB (well, just the stamp.  The <br/>
rest of the box was totally destroyed.  We left the stamp in a big baggie, <br/>
but threw out the box.  The logbook was totally missing, and the stamp pad <br/>
and box were in terrible shape), Maryland Quarter STamp, Rhode Island Quarter <br/>
Stamp, and Ghost Riders.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back, I found the Frog Rock, Kentucky Quarter Stamp, General <br/>
Lyon's Memorial, 1870's Riddle, and the Rainy Day LB.  All in all, a great <br/>
day!  Thanks Bluebird and Butterfly... and all who planted boxes out there in <br/>
that neck of the woods!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting tomorrow in Sunny CT!<br/>

Well... since I didn't know we were going to Danielson until I was underway, <br/>
I didn't bring ANY clues... I relied on Butterfly and Bluebird.  I guess that <br/>
means that we will be visiting Danielson again!<br/>
<br/>
Oh well.... and to think that I got around Ross Pond in less than an hour.... <br/>
I guess I'll have to do that again!<br/>
