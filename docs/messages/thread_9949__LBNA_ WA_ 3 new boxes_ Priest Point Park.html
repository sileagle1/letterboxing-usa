<br/>
Got ourselves out to Priest Point Park yesterday during a lull in the rain.<br/>
Made a visit to the Nail's Game Letterboxes.<br/>
Glenn brought his son's Akita along for the hunt. Real nice dog around people,<br/>
but meeting other large dogs is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Found 42 and Farkle in great shape and marveled at the fine detail of the<br/>
carvings.<br/>
Nail 'em! gave us a problem, seems we made the wrong interpretation on one of<br/>
the clues and went off on a wild goose chase. When we got there, it was evident<br/>
that we weren't the only ones to make that mistake. After retracing our steps<br/>
back to a known landmark, we proceeded on another choice and were rewarded with<br/>
the Dog Tired Hitchhiker set to rest by Hoopoe in the Nail 'em! box.<br/>
Seemed fitting since we brought a dog!<br/>
She was tired too by this time, she'd had enough of this wandering around<br/>
aimlessly in the woods with two guys that can't read clues.<br/>
<br/>
Since Dog Tired has no license, we decided to keep him until a suitable hiding<br/>
place can be found away from the authorities.<br/>
<br/>
Later my wife and I went to Zoo lights at Pt. Defiance Park.<br/>
There are pictures in the pictures area.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks to the Nails for a good hunt!<br/>
Compliments to the carver too!<br/>
<br/>
Trial n Error<br/>
