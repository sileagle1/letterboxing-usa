2 Letterboxes, 3 miles<br/>
<br/>
Rating: Easy to find<br/>
        Semi-easy to walk (one large hill)<br/>
<br/>
Location: From interstate 395 take Exit 93 turning onto route 101 West<br/>
tword Dayville and Pomfret. Go straight through the intersection of 101<br/>
and 169. Just after the junction of 44 is wolf Den Rd. Don't trun here,<br/>
but if you want, this is a campground. Continue up and down the hill,<br/>
(the road is now Rt. 44) on your left is the Main entrance for<br/>
Mashamoquet, don't turn here either, this is the swimming area. Up the<br/>
hill on the left is another campgroung. Keep going untill you pass<br/>
Pete's ice cream drive-in. JUST past it (almost across the street) is a<br/>
Road. There's no sigh at this time. Turn down it and you'll go round a<br/>
few curves. When the road turns sharpley to the right you'll notice a<br/>
road(dirt) joining it on the left. There's a red mark on the tree. If<br/>
your going fast or not paying attention you'll miss it, however it's<br/>
easier to see if you miss it and turn around going back out. Take this<br/>
dirt road. After a little way there will be a dirt road on the right<br/>
take this to a parkinglot, picnic area and outhouses.<br/>
<br/>
Yes this parking area is out in the middle of the woods, but'it's the<br/>
only free parking area during the summer season.<br/>
<br/>
After parking your vehicle, head at 290' back the way you came in. To<br/>
the blue trail. Turn 45'take the blue trail at 10'.<br/>
<br/>
After a while watch for the log that makes a step.<br/>
Cross the wash basin (could be muddy in the spring).<br/>
The barbed wire field is at 300'. Decend down the hill away from the<br/>
field.<br/>
Hop over the log on a rock. If it's muddy there's a pallet nearby to<br/>
help.<br/>
At the stump with the arrow that marks the way go 90'<br/>
At the second marker continue.  <br/>
A bridge lies in wait. Cross it.<br/>
At the T follow the trail to the park 330'<br/>
You are now on the yellow trail.<br/>
Go down the hill. Look for a bridge on your left. <br/>
Walk to the bridge, but don't cross it. Instead go 100'<br/>
The water you see and hear is Mashamoquet Brook.<br/>
