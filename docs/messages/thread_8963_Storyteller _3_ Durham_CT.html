  The Gal Pals beg forgiveness from those who have gone out to Miller <br/>
Pond to do the Storyteller. It seems we need to be more specific. <br/>
When you enter the Main Trail...Stay straight heading around the Pond <br/>
in a counterclockwise fashion. You must keep the water to your left.<br/>
I do not know how to amend the directions but will try to find out.<br/>
<br/>
We hope our friends Butterfly, Bluebird, Angel and Wanda have a big <br/>
cemetery in their hearts to bury our faults.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ct. Storyteller -- Yo, to the Gal Pals, please note, that your early<br/>
clues about the direction  around the Miller pond ~ are not really<br/>
wrong, it is just that it is too easy to take that first left with the<br/>
white and then that puts you going wrong. I think your new suggestions<br/>
about keeping the pond on your left and go in a ccw direction will have<br/>
everyone happy hikers. !! It is a beautiful story , beautiful hike and<br/>
beautiful stamps.  We sure had fun just the same and have been known to<br/>
'go backwards'  on more than one occasion. !!<br/>

No apologies necessary, Gals!  It just gave me the opportunity to go <br/>
around that pretty pond again in both directions (and I did still <br/>
manage to get out before dark! :-)) Loved the theme messages of <br/>
friendship,hope and cooperation,too! Thanks,<br/>
