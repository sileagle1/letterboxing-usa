I am not sure if this question is for you or if someone else could help me out. Our computer is down and has been for sometime. I go to other computers to catch up on letterboxing and check my e-mail. I have had a box reported missing and I have not had the chance to check it. The other two that were reported missing were there. I want to tag the clue "reported missing-not confirmed" but have not been able to because it does not recognize me as a member on other computers. How do I do this? (see box below)<br/>

Remember my password? Heck no! I have trouble remembing to brush my teeth. You<br/>
might think I am kidding but I have to keep toothpaste and a toothbrush in my<br/>
desk at work. Any other suggestions that don't have to do with remembering?<br/>
Thank you very much for the suggestion though...<br/>
