act of revenge because I hate to be one upped!  For those of you <br/>
attending the meet and greet, expect to see a knock down drag out <br/>
fist fight between the ADG and the Squirrel.  <br/>
<br/>
I am absolutely irate that you played such a dirty trick (after we <br/>
tricked you, no less) and if I can stop laughing I will kick your <br/>
scrawny nut collecting butt!<br/>

Tammy<br/>
(but seriously, can we pat the Squirrel down before letting her into <br/>
the meet and greet...she doesn't react well to threats...I once saw <br/>
her beat the stuffing out of a chipmunk that looked at her funny)<br/>

Maybe she is a kangaroo, disguised to look like a greysquirrel. The <br/>
