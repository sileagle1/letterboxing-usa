Since our society had adopted the crossed ribbon symbol for a variety <br/>

God Bless America), perhaps we can combine both symbols this way.<br/>

The Purple Ribbon Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
We all know the current sociological imagery of the symbol of the <br/>
crossed ribbon.<br/>
<br/>
It could be purple as a nod to injury in the course of letterboxing, <br/>
using the color purple as the symbol for injury, inspired by but not <br/>
disrespecting the origin of the symbol of the Purple Heart as awarded <br/>
to those who were injured in the line of duty during time of war.<br/>
<br/>
May we please all take a collective deep breath, contemplate with <br/>
sincerity the desire to compromise, then post back your thoughts (and <br/>
perhaps even agreement) that the new letterbox to be awarded to those <br/>
injured in the course of letterboxing should be called:<br/>

Every letterboxer I've met has seemed like a real good person with a sense of caring and respect. I'm sure this box was created only out of respect and inspired by our servicemen who are fighting for our freedom. If the title is not changed and you are offended . . . I suggest you just pass it on.<br/>

Guess I posted too soon, I should have read ALL the messages before I<br/>
posted.  My point is that I think the Purple Heart is disrespectful<br/>
and am glad that someone is changing it.<br/>
