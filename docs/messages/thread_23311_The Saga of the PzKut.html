<br/>
     May I call you fellow letterboxers? In the approximately 12 days spent in the investigation of this mysterious case I have been become intrigued with the concept of letterboxing and am looking forward to devoting time to finding and planting the hidden treasures. <br/>
<br/>
     This case, I am pleased to inform you, is solved. "Who is it?" you ask. That, dear letterboxers, is for you to discover. The evidence is before you. For a community comprised of solvers of mysteries this should not be a difficult challenge. One of these esteemed letterboxers has lied and is guilty. The rewards will be great for the first one of you to correctly solve this most devastating caper. If you believe you have the correct answer contact me at investigator_bacon @ yahoo. com<br/>
<br/>
     Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely <br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>

sleep, knowing that at any moment someone might snatch them up and <br/>
force them into that awful shredder!<br/>
<br/>
My so-called investigator tells me he knows who did it, but he says <br/>
he's got to have some REAL evidence to make the cops take action! And <br/>
now he claims that I can no longer afford his services. He tells me <br/>
that since the clues have been submitted to the talk list, I should <br/>
rely on my clever letterboxing "friends" to close the case for me.<br/>
<br/>
Since when do I have any friends? If I DID have any friends, they <br/>
certainly wouldn't be clever, now would they? Some kind of <br/>
investigator HE is! Stupid, worthless, private dick, head of the <br/>
Scooby-Doo fan club, gumshoe bonehead trenchcoat idiot...  GRRRRR!!!<br/>
<br/>
Why isn't anyone doing anything? What's wrong with you losers? Aren't <br/>
any of you smart enough to see through the lies and deceit? Can't <br/>
somebody point a finger at this culprit and make it stick? Look <br/>
closer... then look again!! The answer HAS to be there somewhere! <br/>
Have you no conscience? Have you no brains? Have you any Alka <br/>
Seltzer? Ooooooh! I don't feel so good.<br/>
