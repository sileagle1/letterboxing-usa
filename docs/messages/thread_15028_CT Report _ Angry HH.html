at the Perk on Main(WONDERFUL), and headed out to Oma's Outlook plus <br/>
add-ons.  We found all boxes safe and sound.  We ended up with 11 <br/>
boxes total, and we released the Angry HH to make it's next driver <br/>
happy.  We had picked him up yesterday at the DEP box in Goodwin SF, <br/>
Hampton.  We also debuted(sp?) our new family stamp today.  What a <br/>
day!  Thank you to RTRW for the great company, and Gal Pals for all <br/>
the great boxes.<br/>
