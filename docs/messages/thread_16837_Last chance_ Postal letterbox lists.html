If I get your address after I mail them out, you can still be added to the list by whomever has the stamp at the time.<br/>
<br/>
If you get one of the stamps, please let me know, so I can let you know if there are names/addresses to be added. Thanks!<br/>

"You read about all these terrorists- most of them came here legally, but they hang around on these expired visas, some for as long as 10-15 years. Now, compare that to the Blockbuster video store... You're two days late returning a video and those people are all over you!  Let's put Blockbuster in charge of immigration"<br/>

I must have missed something, sorry, but does this mean if we've found 100 <br/>
boxes we can get on the list for this stamp? If so, we just crossed the F-100 <br/>
mark! Please add Diane &amp; John Steele at 39825 Morning Dove Pl., Davis Ca 95616 <br/>
to the list!!<br/>
