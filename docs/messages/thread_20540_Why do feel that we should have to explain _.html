poor guy is just asking a question relax ok...<br/>
He just had an idea<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Why do feel that we should have to explain anything<br/>
&gt;to you? This <br/>
&gt;group is owned by an individual who can do as he<br/>
&gt;pleases. No <br/>
&gt;explanation is needed for you or anybody else. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I've been away for a few weeks and am just now<br/>
&gt;catching up on all <br/>
&gt;this idiocy but I do have a few questions. Who are<br/>
&gt;you people? Where <br/>
&gt;did you come from, and why do you think your opinion<br/>
&gt;matters? <br/>
