The Patches and Decals order form was moved just a few days ago to an <br/>
easier to access location. (Thank you to the webmaster powers that <br/>
be):<br/>
<br/>
First, go to the LbNA website, www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
Click on "New" at the top of the page.<br/>
<br/>
Click on "Patches Order Form".<br/>
<br/>
The new order form has all the info. you need. Where to send check, <br/>
how much postage, price of patches/decals, etc.<br/>
<br/>
(The order form is also still in the October archives if you choose <br/>
to go that route.)<br/>
<br/>
There is no deadline at this time for sending money; I expect to make <br/>
the order in about 3 weeks (mid-Feb).<br/>
<br/>
AGAIN and AGAIN....If you ONLY want patches, send in your money now. <br/>
If you want a patch and decal or decal only, WAIT TILL I NOTIFY THE <br/>
GROUP THAT WE HAVE MET THE MINIMUM TO ORDER DECALS. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks. Any other questions, feel free to ask.<br/>
<br/>

Looking forward to meeting some of you next weekend!!<br/>

I was thinking of Mohmers, not Mirkwood. A bit confused today.<br/>
The wrong form is in message 4081 10/11/00, not on Mirkwood's site.<br/>
