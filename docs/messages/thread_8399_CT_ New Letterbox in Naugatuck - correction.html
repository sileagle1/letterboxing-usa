Naugatuck, CT<br/>
Placed: October 11, 2002<br/>
By: Mike, Beth, John-David, Aaron, Max and Skippy the Wonder Dog<br/>
Difficulty: easy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oops a correction already<br/>
<br/>
This is our first letterbox placement and since we are so close to<br/>
Halloween, and if truth be told, we like cemetaries especially really<br/>
old ones (call us weird if you like) <br/>
<br/>
The stamp is my (Mike's) first ever attempt at carving and while I think<br/>
it's carved well, is on a primitive gum based eraser, I hope it doesn't<br/>
fall apart.<br/>
<br/>
All paces are measured left foot only.<br/>
<br/>
Without further ado ... Here are the clues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a sacred place where the dead are lain,<br/>
Just off the road from Old South Main.<br/>
<br/>
The gated entrance on the road a bit steep,<br/>
Once was referred to as Cemetery Street.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the gates go straight ahead,<br/>
Continue to search amongst the dead.<br/>
<br/>
88 paces and this is no joke,<br/>
until you stand between a maple and oak.<br/>
<br/>
If you see FARBER climb up from the gully,<br/>
Your next clue will be from Polly. <br/>
<br/>
 Find the old maple broken in two,<br/>
embedded in the tree will be your next clue.<br/>
<br/>
Head south/southwest to Lemuel Potter,<br/>
Lois was his wife and not his daughter.<br/>
<br/>
255 degrees and Isaac Hotchkiss  you'll favor,<br/>
Not Elton or Milton or Poor Dora Shaver.<br/>
<br/>
Selim and Amanda, they are in the ground,<br/>
walk 200 degrees and Doolittle will be found.<br/>
<br/>
288 degrees for 12 will be the pace,<br/>
until your final resting place.<br/>
<br/>
Search for the tall bronze monolith, where Ester Wooster lay, <br/>
April 30, 1882 would be the fateful day.<br/>
<br/>
Reach your hand inside the hole,<br/>
go ahead now just be bold.<br/>
<br/>
Push aside the two pieces of slate,<br/>
in the corner your treasure does wait.<br/>
<br/>

If you like graveyards, this one is pretty neat. Very old graves, many<br/>
dating from the civil war and a few from the early 1700's.<br/>
