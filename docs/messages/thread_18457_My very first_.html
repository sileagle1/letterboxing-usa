Two weeks ago I heard about letterboxing through public radio<br/>
(WUOT-Knoxville).  It sounded so fun that I thought I'd try one.<br/>
Yesterday I found one in Townsend, TN, called Aces Wild.  It was quite<br/>
the trek getting there, but it was a beautiful day and I enjoyed the<br/>
journey as much as the find.  Ran into another letterboxer on my way out<br/>
- that was cool!  My 11th grade English class that I teach wants to get<br/>
together to do one on a weekend.  They would also like to plant one as a<br/>
class.  By the way, what are mystery boxes?  Thanks to all for a fun<br/>
hobby!<br/>
