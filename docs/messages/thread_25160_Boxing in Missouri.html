Message from MDC:<br/>
The listing you have posted for MDC refers only to groups of more  <br/>
than 10 people needing to get a Special Use Permit to take part in  <br/>
certain activities on conservation areas.  This is an existing  <br/>
regulation in our Wildlife Code.  Additionally, a new Geocaching/ <br/>
Letterboxing policy took effect in March, 2009.  This policy  <br/>
requires that anyone wishing to place a container (geocache or  <br/>
letterbox) on a conservation area must first request a Special Use  <br/>
Permit from the area manager.  If approved, the person placing the  <br/>
container must comply with a list of Conditions and Considerations,  <br/>
in addition to the standard rules attached to a Special Use Permit.   <br/>
There are restrictions including no more than 2 Special Use Permits  <br/>
per person on any approved conservation area.  There is no charge  <br/>
for a permit and the permit is good for one year at a time.<br/>
<br/>
We have tried to get this information out to many of the geocachers  <br/>
in Missouri and on geocaching.com.   However, I don’t think the new  <br/>
policy has been shared with letterboxers.  With numerous fish,  <br/>
forest and wildlife management activities taking place on MDC areas,  <br/>
it is essential that the manager approve placement of any container  <br/>
and know of the locations.  In scanning the web site I notice many  <br/>
letterboxes on conservation areas with no indication that Special  <br/>
Use Permits have been obtained.  So essentially these are all  <br/>
“illegal” and would be considered littering which is a violation of  <br/>
the Wildlife Code of Missouri (subject to a fine), and can be  <br/>
confiscated by area staff or Conservation Agents.  But don’t be  <br/>
alarmed, it is not likely that they would be!  We encourage  <br/>
geocaching and letterboxing on our areas when and where appropriate,  <br/>
if it does not conflict with our mission and primary uses of our  <br/>
areas.  It’s a great way to get kids and families outdoors to enjoy  <br/>
nature and trails, different habitats, etc.  However, as we do now  <br/>
require permits for this, what is a good way to get the word out so  <br/>
that everyone can be in compliance?<br/>

geocaching &amp; letterboxing together, including this statement that you are<br/>
supposed to  include in your cache/box:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
...  It is part of a worldwide game. You have found a Geocaching or<br/>
Letterbox site. These<br/>
<br/>
games basically involve a player to hide a "treasure" (this container and<br/>
its contents) and<br/>
<br/>
publish the exact coordinates or directional clues on the appropriate Web<br/>
page so users can<br/>
<br/>
go on a "treasure hunt" to find it. The only rules are: if you take<br/>
something from the cache,<br/>
<br/>
you must leave something for the cache, and you must log your visit in the<br/>
logbook. Hopefully, the person that hid this container found a good spot<br/>
that is not easily found by uninterested parties. Sometimes, a good spot<br/>
turns out to be a bad spot, though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IF YOU FOUND THIS CONTAINER BY ACCIDENT:<br/>
<br/>
Great! You are welcome to join us! We ask only that you:<br/>
<br/>
. Please do not move or vandalize the container. The real treasure is just<br/>
finding the<br/>
<br/>
container and sharing your thoughts with everyone else who finds it.<br/>
<br/>
. If you wish, go ahead and take something. But please also leave something<br/>
of your<br/>
<br/>
own for others to find, and write it in the logbook.<br/>

It seems to me that this is an open invitation to remove a stamp from a<br/>

&gt; Treasure hunt<br/>
