                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I headed up to into the north of Michigan (still in the <br/>
lower peninsula).  The day started overcast, and by noon the <br/>
forecasted evening rain had made its early entrance.  Mid-afternoon I <br/>
found myself stamping in on the 45th parallel at Mission Point under <br/>
protect of a massive, dense cedar tree.  Unfortunately, the entire <br/>
trail was not covered with huge cedar trees and by the time I got <br/>
back to the truck, I was soaked through.  Fortunately I had taken <br/>
along extra clothes and didn't have to ride 3 hours back home like <br/>
that!<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the 45th parallel box co-planted by Esperanza and Matt <br/>
the Rat, I found 3 other Esperanza boxes.  One other I had hoped to <br/>
find, the Interlochen box, eluded me, which was too bad since I had a <br/>
little something special planned for this neighbor of the performing <br/>
arts center.  Either my slightly steamy compass readings misled me or <br/>
my paces were not accurate, more likely the latter (see previous <br/>
post).  I must have gone back to the two little pine trees and took <br/>
readings and paces at least 20 times.  I took small steps, and large <br/>
steps, I counted a pace as one foot-fall, I counted a pace as two <br/>
foot-falls.  The amazing thing was every time I ended up between an <br/>
oak and a many-branched pine tree -- seems this combination of trees <br/>
is prolific in the area!<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, since both compass readings were in the same quadrant, I <br/>
abandoned use of the compass and carefully poked a stick down inside <br/>
and around the base of every rotting stump I found between East and <br/>
South, looking for loose debris posing as box covering...  and <br/>
believe me there are a lot of rotting stumps out there.  Finally as <br/>
darkness and still more rain loomed overhead, I decided my presence <br/>
had been enough invasion and headed back up the trail.  I will have <br/>
to take OldShoe back with me to this one...  he has a nose for these <br/>
things!<br/>
<br/>
Also planted the next 3 boxes in my Michigan lighthouses series...  <br/>
clues to follow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Esperanza for some great box locations that made for a very <br/>
scenic trip even in the rain!  Also I was excited to find hand-carved <br/>
stamps, nice job!<br/>
