                    <div class="plaintext-content">I dragged myself out of bed this morning, rubbed the sleep from my eyes, and sipped my first cup of coffee while checking my e-mails.  I had a list of chores as long as my arm and wasn't in a hurry to start the day.  Just before I logged off, I went to the Letterboxing website and checked "What's new."  To my delight, there were 2 boxes in the same area that were just planted yesterday.  I jumped up, ran and got dressed, brushed my teeth, : ) grabbed my keys and took a ride hoping that I would be the first to find them!  <br/>
<br/>
Now let me tell you something about myself...Normally I wouldn't be caught dead going anywhere without a fair amount of makeup and primping.  Prior to starting letterboxing, my car was always nice and neat inside.  Now I have papers strewn everywhere - directions and clues.  I always have a backpack, a change of clothes, hiking boots and bottles of water on the back seat ready to go for my next adventure.  I watch the weather - days in advance and plan where I can go that will allow me to find the box and get home before dark and thunder storms.<br/>
<br/>
I drove feverishly, following the directions to find my prize, wondering what I would do if a letterboxing buddy was there already taking the compass readings and searching.  Would I be polite and not interrupt them or would I have to wrestle them down for it?  Might it be one of the members of this site who will tell the story of a wild woman that snatched the box from them and ran?<br/>
<br/>
Phew, none of that happened, thank God!  I found both boxes and got the first finder's certificate for both.  I can't explain the excitement and passion of this "sport".  I've learned about Crazy Lorenzo Dow, Pomp Equality, Eunice Stocking, and historical sites in the area.  I've found trails that I didn't know existed as well as visited pet cemeteries and State forests in other parts of the state.  I just can't explain exactly what makes me do it, but I thank all of you people who have made it possible and especially Suz who introduced me to it!<br/>
