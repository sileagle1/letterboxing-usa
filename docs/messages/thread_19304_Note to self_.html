Well, I found the Harry Potter Series in Reston, VA today. It was <br/>
kinda funny that while looking for "the rescuer" stamp and <br/>
reading: "Afterwards he was hurt and<br/>
stumbled up the hill from the rock tree" that I STEPPED INTO A<br/>
YELLOWJACKET'S NEST. My boyfriend was off a little ways looking for<br/>
a geocache with another geocacher that we'd met in the woods. I<br/>
didn't run uphill, but I ran to the creek below. I was<br/>
screaming "Jason, Jason". I was just about to rip my clothes off and<br/>
jump into the creek when he came over the hill with the new friend<br/>
cacher. It took several minutes for my rescuer to help to pick them <br/>
out of my pants. I got stung about 25 times. I haven't counted all of <br/>
them yet. I did eventually find the box after much looking.<br/>
<br/>
I was so happy to have found it that I closed my PDA and dind't pay<br/>
attention to the clue sheet on how to get out of the park. SO I went<br/>
back the way I came, or, er tried AND I got lost. We ended up<br/>
walking out of the park through someones back yard(me boyfriend, and<br/>
cacher we'd never met before who was interested in letterboxing and<br/>
hung around, I guess he didn't know better not to follow us).<br/>
Fortunately, I did have 2 geocachers with me, and they both had GPS,<br/>
so we just had to 1.) get satellite reception and 2) get back to the<br/>
car. We were over a mile from the car(which we'd marked for reasons<br/>
like this).<br/>
<br/>
We did eventually make it back to the car(and it required getting<br/>
back into the woods, again tromping through someones backyard), but<br/>
it was a prediciment to be in, since I am ALLERGIC to stings, and had<br/>
just been mauled by a nest of them. It turns out that I didn't do<br/>
more than swell, and do some asthma like coughing, but I survived.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd like for just once to go out and not get hurt. I've been lost<br/>
TWICE, once after dark. I've been covered in ticks. I've twisted my<br/>
ankle, and pulled muscles. I've been sunburnt and rained on. Why<br/>
can't it go my way? But, my only regret is that I only found 4<br/>
letterboxes today.<br/>
<br/>
I did stop by and check on my 1st box on the way home.  The first <br/>
visitors stamped in yesterday.... it was almost exciting as finding <br/>
my first cache.<br/>

<br/>
The tick that got me was when I was looking for a place to plant a LB.  I found the tick the next day, embedded.  The next week I had the rash.  I get to take horse pills for 3 weeks now!!  NO FUN!!!<br/>
