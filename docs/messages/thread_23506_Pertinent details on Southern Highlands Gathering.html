<br/>
  Looks like everything is all set for us to head that way on Friday night! Could you please email me whatever information you have. Also, are you handing out clues that will be posted past Thursday? I will not have access to a printer past Thursday afternoon. And another question, you mention the town boxing trail. Where and/or what is that? Can I actually map it? <br/>
<br/>
  Food for Saturday night is not mentioned. Are we planning to eat as a group before the bonfire? I am having a difficult time trying to understand what exactly I need to bring along. Are drinks provided or should we continuously tote our cooler all weekend to be safe? Id be happy to pitch in for the cost of drinks and ice. Thanks for any help you can offer!<br/>
<br/>
  The rafting trip  what is the age limit, what class rapids, what gear is provided by the outrigger? When does payment need to be made? Is there a weight limit for adults?<br/>
<br/>
  You mentioned the park pavilion has a swimming pool and skate park. Are there fees for the pool? Do you need a membership?<br/>
<br/>
  Those of us staying at http://www.bear-den.com/ are trying to arrange a bonfire on Fri. night. If you are too exhausted from all the gathering craziness, we would love to have you join us. Let me know and I will get you the details!<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry for all the questions. I am just a bit confused.<br/>

  Liz,<br/>

  Don't apologize for the questions - I have not thought of everything; that much is obvious - and I haven't had any offers of help other than KnitWit carving the event stamp (which is AWESOME) - so it is pretty much a do-it-yourself gathering....guess I ought to be more plain about that.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes - provide your own food and drink throughout the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
  I only got one response to the affirmative about the rafting, so I don't think we have a group.  These are Class I or II (thought I mentioned that, but maybe not), and they provide all the gear.  I will shoot them an email and see how full they are - perhaps those who want to can get with each other on Friday or Saturday and group up then.<br/>
<br/>
  I will have copies of all the nearby box clues available at the event - whatever isn't already posted will be planted and posted Thursday evening.<br/>
<br/>
  I will have a separate sheet for the town trail, including approximate distances and box availabilities (some of the businesses that will have an inside box are only open on Saturday mornings during the weekend).<br/>
<br/>
  I will find out about the swimming pool fees (if any) and post it tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for asking pertinent questions!  Sorry I am so lame on some of this, but I've not had the luxury of taking off work to build it like it deserves to be built.  Am cc'ing this to all the lists so more people will know more answers...<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>
