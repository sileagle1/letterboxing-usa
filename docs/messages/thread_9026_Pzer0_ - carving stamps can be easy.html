                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, carving stamps is not all that hard.  I use the easiest to find <br/>
materials and the simplest method imaginable.  All from the local <br/>
drug store.  And I am NO artist.<br/>
<br/>
Erasers, rubber or vinyl<br/>
sharp box cutter (yes it's crude but it is all I've ever used so far)<br/>
small spiral note pad for log journal<br/>
zip lock bags<br/>
sealable lunch / leftovers boxes<br/>
stamp pad (surprisingly the hardest to find)<br/>
<br/>
The simplest drawing technique I read on one of the links in <br/>
letterboxing.org: <br/>
<br/>
Draw in pencil on paper within a traced outline of your eraser.  <br/>
Can't draw? Even easier is to pencil the outline of a picture right <br/>
on the picture.  Sometimes I search google.com Images for a pic the <br/>
right size and subject and just print it out and outline over it.  <br/>
The cleverer computer people can copy the picture into Word and size <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Then turn the paper over onto the eraser and rub it.  The pencil <br/>
drawing is transferred to the eraser AND it is properly reversed for <br/>
the stamping.<br/>
<br/>
Then you slowly and carefully cut out the lines by cutting little <br/>
trenches under them.  Hold the blade at an angle cutting under the <br/>
pencil lines on either side of the line and lift them out.  If you're <br/>
careful you can make fine lines, if not, crude lines.  Who cares.  <br/>
<br/>
Do others make lovely stamps that I'm not capable of?  They sure do.  <br/>
But I've seen some pretty crude stamps out there and enjoyed them.<br/>

If you are in the VA area, Dollar Tree dollar stores are currently carrying a 2-pack of cheap stamp pads, I just buy a bunch whenever I see them.Â  Craft stores are the other really dependable place.</body></html>
