So, you can add something to the inbox at the LbNA website that sends <br/>
messages about your personal boxes directly to your personal email address?<br/>
Would it be too difficult to walk we semi-lay computer people through<br/>
the basics of exactly how to do this? <br/>

Along with the new site, there is a new Yahoo group called lbox-<br/>
announce.  When you add a new box at the new site, you have the <br/>
option of "announcing" the box to this list.  If you check the box, <br/>
it will automatically send a message to the lbox-announce list about <br/>
your new box.<br/>
<br/>
As with any other Yahoo group list, once you are a member, you have <br/>
the option of receiving the messages in individual e-mail messages, e-<br/>
mail digest form or to not receive e-mails (in which case you would <br/>
probably view them online).<br/>
<br/>
By setting yourself up to receive individual e-mail messages from <br/>
this group, you can then route the messages to specific folders once <br/>
they are received by your e-mail program using the rules feature <br/>
(this works with Outlook and Outlook Express but I don't know about <br/>
others).<br/>
<br/>
Are we talking the same thing?  If so, sure I would be happy to try <br/>
and outline the steps to do this.<br/>

Thanks for your reply. Since I really do love reading much of the Lb email, I <br/>
think I'll just leave things the way they are. If I have the option of only <br/>
reading what I choose to come to me, I might get lazy and not read the rest. <br/>
Them I would miss things like finding our how LizardButt got his name!<br/>
<br/>
 I sure appreciate you taking time to straighten me out! Consider me <br/>
straightened!<br/>
