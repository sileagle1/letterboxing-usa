A great time was had by all at A &amp; J Bear's house!!! It was lots of <br/>
fun as always and it was also neat to meet Silver Eagle and Baby Bear <br/>
from Texas, CW Sun Seeker from Nevada (who's personal stamp I've <br/>
always admired) and Kelly &amp; Alex who are newbies but from our area so <br/>
we'll get them started in the right direction!!! Thanks for hosting <br/>
this fun gathering A-Bear =)<br/>
