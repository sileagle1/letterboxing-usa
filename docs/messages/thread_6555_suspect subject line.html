TWIMC -<br/>
<br/>
I've been without internet access for the last five and a half weeks.  I<br/>
have a mountain of personal messages from people on this list (and other<br/>
letterboxing-related messages), many of which I will prolly not have time <br/>
to read.  The others I'll get to in a few days.  If it was real important, <br/>
send it again, unless it is asking for help with my clues (they get filtered <br/>
to /dev/null automatically :-))<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

<br/>
And some comments on the "database" thread ... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
As one of the co-founders of the site known as LbNA and one-time webmaster<br/>
(as if my opinion has any more value than anyone else's :-)), I feel like <br/>
chiming into the "database" thread -- Its long, possibly incoherent and <br/>
contradictory -- just meant to throw out some thinking aloud (and may be<br/>
totally off-base, as I have no idea if the webmasters have changed the <br/>
way things work), but here goes anyway ...<br/>
<br/>
First of all - I have a different view of letterboxing than many people -<br/>
in particular - that it should basically be a secret activity.  So should<br/>
a "database" allow logging of visits to each box, ala other web sites in<br/>
similar hobbies?  Is this what people want?  If it is a mystery box, and<br/>
all these people who live in Boise log visits to it, does this make<br/>
the hobby more fun?  I'm just curious as to what people think about<br/>
this sort of stuff ...  I know I would like to be able to "opt out" for<br/>
my stuff.  There is no doubt about two facts ... logging will compromise<br/>
the obscurity of some clues and the mystique of certain boxes, and <br/>
letterboxing has been practiced elsewhere for over a century without this <br/>
sort of logging or database.<br/>
<br/>
Now, perhaps "database" isn't about logging finds but means a way for <br/>
everyone to post and edit their clues without (or with minimal) webmaster <br/>
involvement.  Do people want this?  People already have this ... they <br/>
can put clues up in their own web space (virtually everyone with access <br/>
to the web has access to free web space).  In the old days, the webmasters <br/>
encouraged people to set up clues in their own web space ... I think one <br/>
of the mistakes the webmasters may have made was creating the "courtesy clues" <br/>
on the letterboxing.org web site when people didn't do this.  This adds to the <br/>
labor.  (When I was a worker bee webmaster, I didn't do this -- I created a <br/>
link to the talk list archive in these cases.  In my mind, your choice was <br/>
to create clues on your own web site, or post to the talk list -- in either <br/>
case, you got a link, not the copy reformatted and reposted).<br/>
<br/>
My vision was that letterboxing.org was a decentralized index site, not<br/>
a centralized content site.  Lets say we want a centralized content<br/>
site ("database") at letterboxing.org with all sorts of editing by the<br/>
authors of clues.  The technical issues are not difficult.  Freeware <br/>
scripts are no doubt lying around that do alot of the heavy lifting;<br/>
if not, basic ones really aren't that hard to write.  But there are<br/>
other issues.  Who owns the database?  Who gets to decide how it is<br/>
accessed or whether a reasonable (or unreasonable) fee may be charged<br/>
to access it?  What if the webmasters lose interest or the host company<br/>
implodes?  These aren't intractable issues, but the decentralized model<br/>
mostly avoided them with no fuss or muss, and experience had it that <br/>
attempting to solve these issues could be a bit touchy.  (of<br/>
course, a problem is the "courtesy clues", which seem to represent the<br/>
worst of both worlds ...)     <br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest pro arguments for a database is the box gone missing<br/>
problem.  No one wants to go on a wild goose chase (this may be bogus<br/>
in and of itself -- letterboxing IMHO is about the clues, the route,<br/>
and the place, not the tupperware, but this is another kettle of <br/>
fish altogether ...).  Anyway, the missing box argument is bogus.  If<br/>
the webmasters have a system to post boxes when they are created,<br/>
they should have a system to remove them when reported missing.  In<br/>
other words, handling missing boxes should not be the compelling reason<br/>
to create a database in and of itself (a couple of side points - there will<br/>
always be a delay from the time a box is discovered missing 'till the <br/>
time this fact is widely known, and reports of missing boxes from people<br/>
other than the hider should be ignored by the webmasters, _in general_).<br/>
<br/>
All the above said, I actually argued pretty strongly in favor of a <br/>
database when I was a webmaster.  Why?  Saving labor trumped all these<br/>
reasons.  I argued that the longer it went, the harder it would be<br/>
down the road.  Its still the same argument, I guess (but see below as<br/>
I make it disappear ...).<br/>
<br/>
So - what is to be done.  My recommendations -<br/>
<br/>
1) Eliminate the courtesy clues.  Either make people put clues on their<br/>
own web site, or post them to the list.  Provide links only.  If we<br/>
want to keep the courtesy clues, hire more worker bees.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Make people follow the format Jay suggested.  Ignore all posts that<br/>
do not follow the specified format.  (A form on the web site that asked<br/>
for the required fields then posted to the list would not be hard to<br/>
implement; IIRC, there may already be one there).  If a format is <br/>
specified and followed, its not hard to write a script to take the format<br/>
and update the site.<br/>
<br/>
(these two ideas have the effect of off-loading some of the work from<br/>
the webmasters to the authors, which, IMHO, is entirely fair).<br/>
<br/>
3) I think a database has to be developed if the centralized model is<br/>
desired.  The community may want to work out some of the issues and questions <br/>
alluded to in the earlier paragraphs, tho, first.  The legacy argument<br/>
(how do I get all the existing clues into the database?) is bogus.  It<br/>
can go like this - we have a database - if you want your current stuff<br/>
there - feel free to add it.  Again, offloading the legacy work to<br/>
the authors.  Authors who don't respond can be presumed to not exist,<br/>
as can their boxes.  These clues could be left on a "legacy" area of<br/>
the site ("the lost archives" :-)).  IMO, these preceding points are fair.<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas, like status lists, bulletin boards, site indexes, etc. may<br/>
be nice complements, but to me seem like band-aids that will not solve<br/>
the underlying labor problem in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
So, the choices seem clear --<br/>
<br/>
a) decentralize as much as possible - eliminate courtesy clues - create<br/>
   a standard format and a script to automatically update the clue index <br/>
   from these standard fields - ignore anything that does not comply<br/>
<br/>
b) add more worker bees - if the community likes the status quo, then some<br/>
   percentage of the community should be willing to work for it so the<br/>
   few working now are not overloaded<br/>
<br/>
c) create the database and ignore clues from authors who do not retro them<br/>
   themselves -- the argument that "overhauling the legacy" is the problem<br/>
   goes away ...<br/>

&gt; And some comments on the "database" thread ... ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
As always, Randy, your comments are insightful and extremely well-<br/>
reasoned! Thank you so much for this meaty post...I'll have to re-<br/>
read a couple of times to get the fine nuances, but in reply:<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to fellow letterboxer (and computer expert) Arlen, we are <br/>
again delving into the arcane world of databasing for the LbNA site. <br/>
I personally am very interested in developing a "submit-your-own" <br/>
clue database that will automatically update the state/county lists <br/>
with links.<br/>
<br/>
I hope we'll be able to do this and maintain the current "feel" of <br/>
LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
-re databased updates on letterbox viabilities ("is it really <br/>
there?"), I think everyone knows that I am strongly against it. I do <br/>
encourage people to update their own sites when boxes go missing, and <br/>
frequently update "courtesy pages" when I'm sure the info is correct. <br/>
I doubt we'll have this feature on any future enhancements to the <br/>
site. It is possible that someone will develop something like that <br/>
off-LbNA (a-la the Hitch Hiker tracker you can link to) on their own, <br/>
but I for would probably avoid using it. Still, it's not for me to <br/>
make policy for everyone else, so who knows?<br/>
<br/>
-re "courtesy pages," I agree with you that the original intent of <br/>
the site was provide links and not to store clues. There were a <br/>
couple of reasons for that, including both workload and liability <br/>
issues. I may be hazy on my history, but I seem to recall that I was <br/>
one of the folks who just sort of started making those pages for the <br/>
Connecticut letterboxers. As I remember, I did it because I (or we?) <br/>
were concerned that Yahoo (then "egroups") might not archive messages <br/>
indefinately. It's seemed to have grown beyond what we originally <br/>
intended. Maybe we should link to yahoogroups messages as you suggest.<br/>
<br/>
-another "solution" idea: our hosting service for the website is <br/>
hispeed.net, and part of the service includes a mail server. I'm not <br/>
sure if it has anything like the functions on yahoo, but maybe moving <br/>
this list over there would solve the archiving problem (assuming, <br/>
that is, that the company never dot-bombed). I've been on a couple of <br/>
mailing lists that have moved, however, and it's been a painful <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you so much for your intelligent post!<br/>
