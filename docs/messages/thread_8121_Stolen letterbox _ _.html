<br/>
Seems someone found it, emptied the contents, filled it with weeds <br/>
and tossed it in the Sound... it turned up on the beach at a <br/>
military base in Oak Harbor.  I got a nice email from a gentleman <br/>
there who found the remains (It had the "do not destroy", email etc <br/>
on the lid).<br/>

&gt; The original location was under a bridge relatively close (approx <br/>

&gt; some of the trash under there).  It is a very historic area but <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; don't seem to care.  I found a more secure location a few 100m <br/>
away <br/>
&gt; that I don't think they'll be too interested in.  The other 2 <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; in the series are absolutely fine, but then again, they aren't in <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; area where those kids are likely to hang out.  Also, the box was <br/>
&gt; well marked all over the outside 'do not destroy' and 'do not <br/>
&gt; remove'.  It was labeled as a letterbox and there were copious <br/>
&gt; copies of info sheets explaining the hobby of letterboxing on the <br/>
&gt; inside.  But who knows?  Maybe a bear took it...<br/>
