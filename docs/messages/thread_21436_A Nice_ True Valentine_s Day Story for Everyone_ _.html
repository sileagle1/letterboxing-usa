<br/>
this is truly the best!<br/>
I think that stamp should stay in that letterbox for all to see!!<br/>
but then they probably want to keep it for memories<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
upon Don's recommendation, I am posting it again <br/>
&gt;   here...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Allow me to tell you about my love for letterboxing. or in this<br/>
&gt;   case, <br/>
&gt;   letterboxing for my love (this sounds so cryptic, but it will all <br/>
&gt;   become very clear to you by the end of this story). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Last Friday, 2/11, I got a message through the LbNA website from a <br/>
&gt;   new letterboxer named "StevieFranklin2005" in regards to my<br/>
&gt;   Wooly's <br/>
&gt;   LB. The message was as follows: <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   "If I find your Wooly Letterbox on Saturday (2/12/2005), I will<br/>
&gt;   place <br/>
&gt;   a hitchhiker stamp in it! I hope I understand your clues. PLEASE look <br/>
&gt;   for my stamp on Sunday; I am quite proud of it." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I haven't been doing this LB'ing thing for very long, but the<br/>
&gt;   email <br/>
&gt;   did seem to be a little outside of conventional LB'ing protocol.<br/>
&gt;   I've <br/>
&gt;   always viewed HH's as little surprises, and here this guy was, <br/>
&gt;   declaring to me that upon the discovery of one of my boxes, he was <br/>
&gt;   going to triumphantly plant a HH there to show his conquest. I was a <br/>
&gt;   little amused by the fact that this person was so enthusiastic about <br/>
&gt;   planting a HH, he absolutely HAD to tell me about it and ruin the <br/>
&gt;   surprise. I attributed this behavior to the possibility that he was <br/>
&gt;   so new at this that he didn't know any better.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Anyhow, I emailed him back and told him that I was sure it looked <br/>
&gt;   very nice and that I looked forward to seeing it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I told my boyfriend about it that night, and we both chuckled. My <br/>
&gt;   boyfriend is not as interested in LB'ing as I am. He doesn't<br/>
&gt;   care <br/>
&gt;   much for carving stamps and hiding them, but he does enjoy finding <br/>
&gt;   the stamps with me, as well as the places it takes us to. He <br/>
&gt;   suggested that we should check it out when we had a chance. Seeing <br/>
&gt;   that he actually was up for some minor letterboxing, how could I <br/>
&gt;   refuse? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So Sunday, 2/13 rolled around. Since it was Valentine's Day<br/>
&gt;   weekend, <br/>
&gt;   he had made dinner reservations for us at a nice local restaurant for <br/>
&gt;   7:30. We had spent that morning running a 5K in Chinatown, and then <br/>
&gt;   afterward stayed there for the Chinese New Year festivities. By the <br/>
&gt;   time we got home in the afternoon, we were bushed, so we took a nap, <br/>
&gt;   and he woke us up at around 6PM and said we should get ready to go <br/>
&gt;   out. Now, my boyfriend is typically not a very punctual person, so I <br/>
&gt;   was impressed that he wanted to get up a little earlier so we would <br/>
&gt;   have some time to go look for the HH and still make it to the <br/>
&gt;   restaurant in time. I figured he thought I would enjoy stamping the <br/>
&gt;   HH in my logbook. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It was pretty much dark when we got to Wooly's hiding spot.<br/>
&gt;   I'd never <br/>
&gt;   really been there at night, and was surprised to find that the <br/>
&gt;   location is pretty well lit, with a warm yellowish light emanating <br/>
&gt;   from the streetlight. We retrieved the box and I sat on a bench and <br/>
&gt;   opened it. I saw the HH wrapped in a napkin sitting in a little <br/>
&gt;   baggie. The first thing I noticed was that the HH didn't have its<br/>
&gt;   own <br/>
&gt;   logbook. I looked in my Wooly's logbook and saw that C-Bear and<br/>
&gt;   Koko <br/>
&gt;   had been there that day and stamped in, but no HH imprint!! I <br/>
&gt;   couldn't help but think that StevieFranklin2005 definitely was<br/>
&gt;   new at <br/>
&gt;   this, and that he should have at least looked up how to create a HH <br/>
&gt;   somewhere online. "Well, I'll just look at the stamp itself,<br/>
&gt;   then," I <br/>
&gt;   thought to myself. I took it out of the bag and unwrapped it. It <br/>
&gt;   wasn't as impressive as StevieFranklin2005 had described it to<br/>
&gt;   be. It <br/>
&gt;   only had a few words and some hearts carved into it. I kind of <br/>
&gt;   figured out what the words said and found that it was a<br/>
&gt;   Valentine's <br/>
&gt;   Day themed HH!! I was beginning to think what an interesting idea it <br/>
&gt;   was to place a themed HH in my box, when I heard my boyfriend ask <br/>
&gt;   me, "So what does it say?" I looked up and saw him busily<br/>
&gt;   kneeling <br/>
&gt;   down tying his shoe.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   "It's funny," I said, "It says `Will You Marry<br/>
&gt;   Me?'" <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   "Well, will you?" <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I looked up at him again, somewhat confused. There he was, kneeling <br/>
&gt;   in front of me, with a little box in his hands. I was totally <br/>
&gt;   floored!!! The ring was beautiful! And OF COURSE I SAID YES!!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   The funny thing is, as my mind was swimming around in all the <br/>
&gt;   excitement, I was still confused, and wondered where <br/>
&gt;   StevieFranklin2005's HH was. In case you hadn't figured it<br/>
&gt;   out by now <br/>
&gt;   (like me), it turned out my boyfriend, now "fiance," had<br/>
&gt;   made it all <br/>
&gt;   up!! I had no idea he could be so creative. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Today I got an email from C-Bear and Koko telling me they had found <br/>
&gt;   my box and that there was a personal stamp in there for me. I found <br/>
&gt;   that hilarious! Thanks to the two of you for not having mistaken the <br/>
&gt;   stamp for a real HH, and for contributing to the best moment of my <br/>
&gt;   life!!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I have always been appreciative of the places that LB'ing has<br/>
&gt;   taken <br/>
&gt;   me to, but never did I imagine that it would take me here!!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY EVERYONE!!!!! <br/>
