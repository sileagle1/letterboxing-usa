                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Thanks for the note on the clues. This wasn't an imagination gone <br/>
wild though ,it is only an interpretation of events that actually <br/>
occurered at Lebanon Green. It is so historically signifigant! The <br/>
War Office of the revolution is a muesam there , it is where <br/>
Washington, Rochambeau, Huntington ( declaration of Independence) and <br/>
others met to plan the war. The office was a store belonging to the <br/>
Govenor and Family and he was very knowledgable in provisioning an <br/>
army. If you ever travel this way the Green is just beautiful , to <br/>
all of you near enough to visit ... hope you enjoy. Carol<br/>
