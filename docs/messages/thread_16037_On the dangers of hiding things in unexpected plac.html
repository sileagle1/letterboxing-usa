all carved 'personal traveler's? You could decide on just one question, or<br/>
each have your own question hidden somewhere on base (give clues to the<br/>
hiding spot of the paper that has the person's name and their question). I<br/>
don't think a piece of paper with a question on it hidden on base would<br/>
cause too much of a stir.<br/>

Just a thought,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Point well taken. Each person is entitled to his/her own opinion on the<br/>
matter. Some may say that it is a good idea, whereas others may tend to<br/>
think it not such a good idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So....LetterBoxers of the list.....What do you all think?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. Does is sound like a decent, if not a great, idea...?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. Does is sound like an idea that is asking for trouble and wasting<br/>
precious resources and man/woman hours?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would like to hear the masses ideas on this one....<br/>
