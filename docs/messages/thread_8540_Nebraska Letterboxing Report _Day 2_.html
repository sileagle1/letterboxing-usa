                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was able to gather four more letterboxes yesterday in the Lincoln, NE <br/>
area: Son of Cornhusker, Esperanto and Homing Pigeon in the Prairie Peace <br/>
Park, and Prairie Dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Cornhusker is missing. There's a note in the Son of Cornhusker box's log <br/>
that the Cornhusker box has long been missing -- I think this is an <br/>
orphaned box (one of Der Mad Stamper's?), but there's probably enough <br/>
confirmation that the box is gone to warrant a note on the clues page that <br/>
it's at least been reported missing.<br/>
<br/>
The Esperanto box was lying on its side, but I propped it up with a branch <br/>
so maybe it won't end up in that position anytime soon.<br/>
<br/>
I believe I was the first to find Prairie Dreams, but found the box in sad <br/>
shape. The lid was off the box, and the contents were thoroughly wet, with <br/>
tiny little holes chewed through most of the baggies. I dried the log as <br/>
best I could, rebagged the contents and replaced it, but since I wasn't <br/>
travelling with my fully-loaded letterbox provisions, I didn't have enough <br/>
to really do it justice. It really needs some more TLC, either with the <br/>
journal being replaced or dried out for a couple of days. Funhog, maybe one <br/>
of the Nebraska area 'boxers could adopt this box for you and give it some <br/>
attention. The stamp is really nice, btw, and the preserve is quite <br/>
interesting. The clues are a bit tough to follow -- I ended up coming to <br/>
the box from the complete opposite direction (don't ask me how!).<br/>
<br/>
Found Son of Cornhusker and Homing Pigeon with no trouble, and both were in <br/>
great shape.<br/>
