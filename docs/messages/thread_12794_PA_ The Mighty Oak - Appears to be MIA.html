I took a walk through Peace Valley Park this morning and I was also <br/>
unable to find the The Might Oak box.  I found this box back in <br/>
March of 2002, so I was in the right place.  Last year, I found the <br/>
box right away once I was in the right location; however, after 20 <br/>
minutes to looking around, I gave up.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Muk-Luk (the box planter) will get a chance to verify the <br/>
status of the box and decide whether to mark it missing or not.<br/>

&gt; OK, thanks!  I guess that means I have to try again, too!  I have <br/>
&gt; wondered when you see that a clue is reported as MIA if it's <br/>
possible <br/>
&gt; that just one person didn't do a thorough job of hunting and <br/>
decided <br/>
&gt; to report it, but really the box is still there.  Maybe I'll make <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; a project to hunt down MIA boxes - although that might be a sure <br/>
path <br/>
&gt; to disappointment.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I wouldn't give up on a box just because you didn't find it on <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; &gt; first trip out.  I give a box at least 2 separate trips before I <br/>
&gt; &gt; even start to consider boxes missing.  That being said, I know <br/>
The <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mighty Oak was there a year ago (I found it on my second trip <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; &gt; found the Flight of the Hawk on my first) and after I read its <br/>
log <br/>
&gt; &gt; book, it took most people multiple trips to find it.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe if I have some time this weekend, I'll see if I can find <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; &gt; again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My advice, try again.  Sometimes missing boxes aren't really <br/>
&gt; missing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I did the search for 2 letterboxes at Peace Valley with two <br/>
&gt; &gt; friends; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we hunted and hunted for The Mighty Oak, but finally gave up.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; When <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we discovered Flight of the Hawk, everyone who had stamped in <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; last two years wrote that they couldn't find The Mighty Oak.  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore feel pretty confident this box is MIA.  How do I get <br/>
&gt; &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the clues??<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!!<br/>
