<br/>
FREE Dating Websites For Singles and Married.htm - that file's description<br/>
speaks openly about having sex pictures. If this mailing list is an<br/>
adult-only list, then it should be made clear SOMEWHERE. If it is for all<br/>
ages, why are you allowing people to post sex pictures to the file<br/>
area?????? I intend to research the matter after I finish posting this<br/>
message to determine if this is a violation of federal law. I believe it is,<br/>
but I'm going to find out whom to contact and how to report that file<br/>
remaining on an all-ages area with NO warnings posted ANYWHERE. Since my own<br/>
son is a member of this list and thereby has the ability to access that<br/>
file, that is AT LEAST ONE MINOR HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO PORNOGRAPHY AS A DIRECT<br/>
RESULT OF THE INACTIVITY OF THE MODERATOR and I'm sure he is not the only<br/>
one. Therefore, the moderator has already committed a crime against a minor<br/>
and leaving it there constitutes further crimes against children. Given that<br/>
it has been up there for 4 days, I'd think any moderator doing their job<br/>
would have had ample time to take it down. Unless the moderator wishes to<br/>

<br/>
HELLO MODERATOR - there is one on this list right? Are you watching what is<br/>
going on? Do you feel that PORNOGRAPHY has something to do with letterboxing<br/>
and it is vital that those picture be distributed to MINORS? Is letterboxing<br/>
an adult-only activity and you just FORGOT to post that anywhere in any<br/>
information? Or is your goal to purposely lure in families just to<br/>
distribute porn?<br/>
<br/>
I fully realize that file was posted by a member during the recent slew of<br/>
porno attacks on Yahoo! lists. Oddly enough though, of the 37 lists I'm a<br/>
member of, only this one has LEFT the porn file up for one and all to enjoy.<br/>
Every other moderator realized that DISTRIBUTING PORNOGRAPHY TO MINORS IS A<br/>
CRIME and immediately took it down. This list however, they appear to be<br/>
encouraging the crime to continue.<br/>
<br/>
In my mind, continuing to have that file there, where any kid can view it,<br/>
is the moderator's purposeful distribution of pornography to minors and<br/>
he/she should be taken immediately to task if that file isn't off there<br/>
within two minutes of them reading this post. As a moderator of more than a<br/>
dozen Yahoo! groups myself, I know exactly how long AND how easy it is to<br/>
remove that file so choosing not to is choosing to continue to commit a<br/>

nobody was distributing porn TO A MINOR...they were distributing it TO A LIST......<br/>
<br/>
i clicked on some of those links....did any  of them had the word sex in them (big clue)....and the pictures (not all showed up for me so there may have been some very graphic) that came up on the main entry page ...before entering the websites (i did not enter any).....looked to be what you can see on HBO SHOWTIME and other like movie channels....<br/>
<br/>
if you watch rap videos...if you listen to rap music....you get exposed to sexual content of one form or another....<br/>
<br/>
do you watch MTV???.....do you watch the childs tv viewing habits at home....when he is at another persons home???....<br/>
<br/>
do any children have the T rated video games???....ive seen some sexual looking stuff in those....<br/>
<br/>
sex is on the world wide web.....you can stumble across it anywhere....<br/>
<br/>
if a child is cruising the web then they needs to be monitored to be sure he does not enter these areas....even monitoring their cruising is not foolproof....<br/>

Go Ahead lets threaten the moderators.  Then thay will quit.  Its <br/>
legally much safer to not moderate at all that way they are not held <br/>
accountable when something slips through   I am sure that none of them <br/>
intended to distribut porn.  But to be sure, go ahead file charges-- <br/>
sue them.   Its the American way.    Lets shut  down the list then we <br/>
can all be safe.    <br/>

I am beginning to think the same way. It seems that we cannot behave <br/>
kindly to each other. This is after I have been telling everyone <br/>
about how family-oriented letterboxing is, or was. <br/>
<br/>
Now we have the threat of lawyers and FBI. Really! We also have cross-<br/>
posting of a Christian discussion group. Totally out of control! Some <br/>
folks are bashing geocachers and this is not even a geocaching site! <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we had just better post our boxes to the letterboxing.org <br/>
site and leave off with posting here. I, for one, would not want to <br/>
see innocent volunteers pilloried as child pornographers. <br/>
<br/>
Fact is, right after that was posted, I went up to the supposed <br/>
pornographic ad and saw not one picture. Not one! Maybe that troll <br/>
was a hoax but it sure was a cruel one. <br/>
<br/>
The only other solution I can see is to kick off anyone under 18, or <br/>
over 18 but still living with their parents. Make this an adults only <br/>
site and we will not get into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, this is America (and Canada), land of lawyers,<br/>

I would really hate to lose this group having only just discovered it.<br/>
One cannot expect the  moderators to be constantly on patrol cruising<br/>
the files.  Why not instead make a public post to all members and<br/>
those who join that although this is a family sport and group, there<br/>
have been instances in the past where posts and images of adult nature<br/>
have been made.  Be warned that while these things are not welcomed,<br/>
they sometimes happen and will be removed as quickly as possible.  And<br/>
to please, should you see something offensive to notify a Moderator<br/>
who's name and email link can be found at the URL:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/members?group=mod<br/>
I, having only discovered this page myself will be using it in the<br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
ps. child pornographers? no way! I think this was an upset mom venting<br/>
in the moment. I cannot imagine ANYONE seriously charging our<br/>
moderators with this. I'd say that charge would have more legs against<br/>
the person who made the singles/dating post<br/>

don't delete them. forward them immediately to the abuse department of their<br/>
ISP's.  pull up the properties of each email, copy and paste the headers<br/>
with the full email, and send them in.  there is no excuse for anyone to be<br/>
making threats against a child, even out of anger.<br/>
<br/>
this whole thing is making me sick.  and i thought letterboxing was supposed<br/>
to be a fun hobby made up of friendly enthusiasts.  it's making me rethink<br/>
this new pasttime.<br/>
