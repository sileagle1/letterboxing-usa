                    <div class="plaintext-content">As was posted recently, LoneMassWolf is visiting our neck of the woods<br/>
next weekend.  He says Saturday or Sunday night he can get together with<br/>
any letterboxers willing to meet up.  <br/>
<br/>
I have tickets to hear Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg (my favorite classical<br/>
musician) play with the Oregon Symphony on 11/3, Saturday night so if<br/>
something is planned for then I will not be there.<br/>
<br/>
However!  If you all are willing to get together maybe early Sunday<br/>
evening on 11/4, after the sun goes down, say 5:00 pm I will be glad to<br/>
plot something out.  He's staying out in Lake Oswego and will be<br/>
letterboxing on the west side of Portland.  Maybe we can do the meet up<br/>
at Izzy's in Beaverton like Thom Cheney, Der Mad Stamper, Michelle and I<br/>
did earlier this year when we discussed the spring summit we had at the<br/>
Tualatin Hills Nature Park.<br/>
<br/>
OR...if someone else has any better ideas I'm totally open to it.  Let's<br/>
give this guy a big welcome and if anyone in the Tacoma area (Glenn &amp;<br/>
Bill) or Seattle (Amanda &amp; Mischief) can make it all the better!!!    I<br/>
hope all Portland area boxers are willing.  I'd love to meet Funhog and<br/>
I've barely met Ryan once and then I didn't realize what a significant<br/>
contribution he was about to make to letterboxing in this area.  <br/>
<br/>
Der Mad Stamper was saying he wanted a fall event a while back while the<br/>
New Englanders were planning theirs.  Here's our big chance, Folks!!!<br/>
What say, let's do it!!!<br/>
<br/>
