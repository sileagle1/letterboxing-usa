Hamburg, PA today. These were originally planted in 98-99 by Marty, making <br/>
them some of the earliest letterboxes planted in the US, but had fallen <br/>
into disrepair in recent years. Now that they've been adopted, the boxes <br/>
have new logs and stamps, and the clues have been verified (and adjusted as <br/>
necessary). You can find the clues on the LbNA site or at:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/silentdoug/planted.php<br/>
<br/>
It's a 9-mile round trip along the Appalachian Trail to get both boxes, but <br/>
you'll be rewarded with spectacular views and two letterboxes!<br/>
