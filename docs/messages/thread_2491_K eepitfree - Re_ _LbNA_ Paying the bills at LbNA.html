The Webmasters were formed as a group in order to separate the workload<br/>
of the site from the talk list so that the pastime could develop as a<br/>
happy activity  not overrun with administrative details.  It is not<br/>
possible to accomplish much in a timely manner with a large group, so a<br/>
smaller group was formed of the originators and several web-savvy<br/>
talklist contributors.  Active membership has shifted over the years and<br/>
has been accomplished without a formal organization.   Shared governance<br/>
has been a hallmark of the group from the beginning and members have<br/>
represented a diversity of geography, background, skills and<br/>
temperament.<br/>
<br/>
    You are correct in noting that alternatives have existed at various<br/>
times in the groups history. Many topics are rediscovered on the list as<br/>
the active participants change in any given span of months.  Many newer<br/>
list "talkers" do not recognize posts by participants whose history<br/>
stretches back to the beginnings in 1998 and this is fine.  Many<br/>
discussions have occurred previously and there are reasons why things<br/>
are done in the manner that one sees on the site.  If there are<br/>
questions, ask.  There is certainly opportunity for change and for<br/>
improvement.<br/>
<br/>
    Recent postings regarding a single subject of "liability" displayed<br/>
a great variety of heartfelt approaches to the topic and created a<br/>
magnitude of controversy that left in its wake hurt feelings and<br/>
possible estrangement from the group.  If a single person had control of<br/>
the site discussions, such as that one, could be moderated (edited or<br/>
black-out) and the forum could be manipulated to conform with a single<br/>
person's views.  The group founders wish  to avoid this.<br/>
<br/>
    The choice of a commercial site was made because it offered the<br/>
Webmasters the best opportunity for shared governance by having multiple<br/>
access points through a single password.  We have been willing to pay<br/>
out of our own pockets for the site through our love for the activity.<br/>
None of us is independently wealthy and all have families.  The work and<br/>
funds have not been born equally, but each has contributed what they<br/>
can.  As the workload has increased we have discussed ways to ease the<br/>
burdens.  One of the ways is letting the group know that help and funds<br/>
would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
    Another founding principle has been to use our true names.  The use<br/>
of "boxing names" or aliases has become more prevalent in the past year<br/>
and may have a point as the group continues to grow.  However, it is<br/>
reasonable for me to point out that the "founders" did not use aliases<br/>
and have formed lasting friendships and working relationships with<br/>
people across the country and in Dartmoor.  Some of us have met in<br/>
person, and others have not, geography has made its presence known in<br/>
this cyberworld.  The fact of geography has not prevented exchange of<br/>
ideas and philosophy.  In this way, the magic of the Internet has<br/>
brought us back in time to some of the correspondence masterpieces of<br/>
previous centuries.  Perhaps our group is blessed by geography and<br/>
diversity.<br/>
