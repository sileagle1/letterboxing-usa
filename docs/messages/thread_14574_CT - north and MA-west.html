                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone.. found my 20th box today! whohoo! for small victories.  <br/>
I can't even imagine 3000:0     Letterboxing is my quiet time and I'm <br/>
usually alone.<br/>
Anyways I wanted to pass on some box info for anyone who might <br/>
be interested: <br/>
Perseid and Missing Rings both great shape and lots of visitors. <br/>
Gemini.. also in great shape. <br/>
Compass... That may take me a while but I'll not give up! <br/>
It's Not Ruff... I searched and searched but couldn't find it, even <br/>
though I found each mentioned landmark.<br/>
Winter Gathering.. SO damp it's getting moldy.<br/>
 All the stamps in it will be lost forever :( if the <br/>
log doesn't get dried out soon. <br/>
Music woman, did you have any luck with that? I saw your note so I <br/>
didn't want to interfere. I was the first visitor since May. <br/>
 Also, Out of this world, present and accounted for. <br/>
That's all for now. Catch you on the flip side...of the trails! <br/>

Pack to change out the logbook once school starts in September.  Suffield is <br/>
very close to Enfield and one of my schools that I work at.  Unfortunately, I <br/>
probably won't be up in that neck of the woods until then.  And no..... I didn't <br/>
have any luck in drying out the logbook.  If I had a few hours, then I could <br/>
have dried it out!  Unfortunately, I was on my way to school when I picked it <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
I hope its gets some TLC soon!<br/>
