<br/>
This is my first contact with the list  - I have been lurking for a few<br/>
months now.  Just wanted to say this letterboxing site is terrific, and<br/>
I am interested to see all the different opinions that everyone has.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I would add my 2 cents over something that happened this<br/>
weekend.  Defygravity (?) made a good point last post about letting<br/>
someone know where you are going when you set off to letterbox,<br/>
especially when you are going alone.  I did the BeaverTail Light box,<br/>
Jamestown, Rhode Island, on Saturday and had a real harrowing<br/>
experience.  The hunt for a box involves going along a "goat" trail on<br/>
the side of a cliff, with a pretty sharp drop to the rocks and ocean<br/>
below.  Being sure footed I never gave a thought to any danger.<br/>
However, the path is actually eroding away from the rocks, and the<br/>
ground gave way beneath me.  I managed to grab onto an exposed tree root<br/>
before I tumbled to far down the side of the cliff, but as I was hanging<br/>
by my fingernails, it occurred to me that no one knew where I was.   If<br/>
I had actually fallen, it would be a long time before my battered and<br/>
broken body was found.  Realizing this, I managed to drag myself back<br/>
onto the path with just a few scratches and bruises - and a big PHEW!<br/>
Actually finding the box was all the sweeter for trial I went through.<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone starts anything, I am just alerting people to be careful<br/>
when doing this box.  I have no trouble with my responsibility as the<br/>
person searching for the box, and am not holding anyone responsible for<br/>
my actions or letterboxing choices.  I like to live on the edge, so it<br/>
worked out terrific for me.  Just in the future, I should probably<br/>
letterbox with a buddy, or at the very least, let someone know where I<br/>
am!<br/>
<br/>
That's all for now.<br/>
