<div>Hi there,</div>
<div>    I read the Smithsonian 
article and was intrigued.  Love the Letterboxing N.A. site.  I have 
been carving rubber stamps, and tramping around, for years and this just puts it 
all together.  I'm also a minister and this Easter I prepared a 
letterboxing Easter pilgrimage along a beautiful trail that winds along the 
riverbank of our town.  It was very succesful, five letterboxes with an 
Easter theme, and twenty one people took part.  Now I want to get some 
letterboxes out on the trails that surround our town.  A nice bonus is that 
the soon to be complete trans-canada trail system will come right through 
here.  Any other Canadians along the trail interested in getting out some 
letterboxes to add to the experience?</div>
<div>Contact me, Robert Murray, at Box 222, Pinawa, 
Manitoba, R0E 1L0 - or e-mail <a href="mailto:murray@granite.mb.ca">murray@granite.mb.ca</a>  Check out our 
town on the web, <a href="http://www.pinawa.com/">http://www.pinawa.com/</a> 
with a cool picture of our new pedestrian suspension bridge on a local 
trail.</div></div></body></html>

Welcome!  I don't know if there are any other Cdn. letterboxes around,<br/>
but maybe one of the more active members may know.  Just thought I'd<br/>
say hi to a fellow Canuck and Manitoban.  I'm originally from Winnipeg<br/>
(transplanted to the US now) - maybe someday when we visit the 'rents<br/>
we'll visit your letterboxes as well!<br/>
