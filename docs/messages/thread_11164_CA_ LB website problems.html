<br/>
I tried to print up a copy of the Los Lobos Marinos Mystery LB in <br/>
Monterey County, CA today and the clues are gone!  The link on the <br/>
LBNA website takes you to a US Search webpage.  I have no earthly <br/>
idea as to why this has happened.  In the event you'd like to repost <br/>
these clues for other curious letterboxers out there who might be <br/>
interested in searching for this letterbox, here's the clue again (I <br/>
can't call them up in the archives anymore for some reason, but then <br/>
again I can only ever call up &amp; search about two weeks' worth of <br/>
postings in the archives anyway):<br/>
<br/>
Los Lobos Marinos Mystery Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Start At: It's a Mystery!<br/>
Monterey County<br/>
California<br/>
<br/>
Setting: Located within the absolutely beautiful and spectacular <br/>
park with the Punta de los Lobos Marinos.<br/>
<br/>
Time: Unknown<br/>
Distance: Unknown<br/>
Difficulty: Clues easy, hike easy/variable depending on which way <br/>
you approach it. This will be extremely easy if you have access to a <br/>
trail map.<br/>
<br/>
Comments: When you're finished, please re-hide this micro-letterbox <br/>
extremely well considering the major weather patterns commonly <br/>
occurring in this region. This letterbox is essentially an orphan!<br/>
Please email me at dvn2rckr@yahoo.com when/if you find it. If you'd <br/>
like to adopt it, let me know, too, and I would be eternally <br/>
grateful to you.<br/>

CLUE:  From the 'whale' of a bench atop Whalers Knoll, head South <br/>
taking you up, down and around switchbacks toward lacy lichens. Bear <br/>
R at the 1st 'Y' and R at the 'T' with the metal water cap. <br/>

Thanks, Bethany...I think that's fixed again. Sorry!<br/>

If you're doing a search on the yahoogroups website, you're right: it <br/>
only searches back a couple thousand posts at a time. But each time <br/>
it's done, you can click "next," eventually searching all the way <br/>
back to post #1.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about all the California snafus: to update the LbNA site I use <br/>
a little gift from Bill Gates called Microsoft FrontPage, and it <br/>
often thinks it's smarter than the person doing the inputing, <br/>
changing links at will. I thank Mr Gates every day for this stuff.<br/>

Jay in nooooo, please don't snow tomorrow CT<br/>
