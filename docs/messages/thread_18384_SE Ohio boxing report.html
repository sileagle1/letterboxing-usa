                    <div class="plaintext-content">Team Bigguy took advantage of the glorious weather to travel down to<br/>
Scioto Co. and pick up several of Bloodhound's boxes we've had our<br/>
eye on for awhile. We found seven (five first finders!) and planted<br/>
two to round out a very nice afternoon. We started with Passenger<br/>
Pigeon which, despite being planted only 3 days ago, has it's log two<br/>
thirds full already. Then, on to Portsmouth to find the King of the<br/>
Cowboys, down to the masonic hall for Square &amp; Compasses, and out to<br/>
the wilderness for Bring a Basket and Binoculars, Turkey Creek,<br/>
Roosevelt Lake, and Wolf Den. Beautiful places and great stamps!<br/>
Sadly though, it appears Franzsolo's Picnic Point has been bulldozed<br/>
down the hill. We also intended on going for Pond Lick but the road<br/>
was closed so the state could airlift out huge logs felled by the<br/>
massive icestorm of 2003. They were using huge, twin-rotor Chinook<br/>
style choppers - amazing to see. Along the way we planted Jester and<br/>
Rocky - the latest 2 of CardinalMom's Un4gettable Toys. Hope you all<br/>
got to enjoy the day as well!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hope you all enjoyed the beautiful weekend and got to do some<br/>
letterboxing. We managed to work some in. We found Mr. Bloodhood's<br/>
Panther Passing Over and Logan boxes. Magnificent stamps - truely<br/>
works of art! We also replaced the Indian Fighter box in<br/>
the 'Legends' series (clues have changed!) and placed the last five<br/>
boxes in CardinalMom's Un4gettable Toys series - clues to follow<br/>
within the next day or so. We also managed to hit another milestone<br/>
of sorts. Our anniversary of letterboxing is tomorrow - April 19 -<br/>
and with what we did today our PFXE count has topped 250 for our<br/>
first year in the hobby. It's been a lot of fun! We've seen some<br/>
great stamps, some beautiful places, and met some great people. We<br/>
can hardly wait to start on our second year! Happy 'boxing!<br/>
