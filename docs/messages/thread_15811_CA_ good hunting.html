                    <div class="plaintext-content">A gorgeous weekend at Lake Tahoe was emphasized by some wonderful boxing this <br/>
weekend. We started off being the first finders of A-Bear's In-N-Out box in <br/>
Davis (delicious!) got Cavilier Manor's "Emerald Bay Box" (first finders also!) <br/>
and were amazed by the wonderful hike and awesome--in the truest sense--view <br/>
at PadFoot Stamper's Lake Tahoe Mini Box. Don't miss that one! Clever box and <br/>
stamp too! On the way home we got A-Bear's Bear Cub, adorable! First finders <br/>
there too!! Oh, there were a couple of HHs along the way too--hint, hint.<br/>
<br/>
We planted a box near Homewood, CA (clues to be posted soon) and REPLACED our <br/>
store-bought stamp at our To The Lake box with a newly carved one.<br/>
<br/>
Our only disappointment was Desolation Wilderness at Echo Lake at Tahoe's <br/>
south shore. About 3 hours, water taxi and all, and couldn't find the box. Have <br/>
contacted Fred for hints. Beautiful day and great hike though!<br/>
<br/>
Happy stamping!<br/>
