finished chores and  checked out another new Mansfield Park. Soon we <br/>
will post the new series at Coney Rock Preserve and if one word <br/>
describes this piece of land it is WOW! This will be Pink Trotters <br/>
first series  she has been busy carving. We got started today but <br/>
darkness sent us home , many hemlocks here and with all the clouds <br/>
there was very little light.  We were so  impressed with the variety <br/>
of landscape here. So keep a look out for this series to be finished <br/>
soon.  Leader of the pack<br/>
