                    <div class="plaintext-content">My dear Investigator Bacon,<br/>
<br/>
My, how soon you have turned on me now that you are no longer on my <br/>
payroll! But by pointing a finger at me, you've only hurt your own <br/>
reputation as a crime solver. Anyone with any brains at all will see <br/>
that your charges are unfounded and completely ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
For starters, everyone knows that no matter how much tequila you give <br/>
me, there isn't a chance that anything could slip from my lips that <br/>
would make any sense to you or anyone else! Can you honestly think of <br/>
even 1 single occasion where such an event has transpired? I think <br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
And you can inform that Post Toastie client of yours that I am the <br/>
living embodiment of good manners. Have you already forgotten how <br/>
willing I was to share the worm with you from the bottom of that <br/>
expensive bottle of Mescal on the morning after my precious PZ Kut <br/>
was stolen?<br/>
<br/>
In fact, just today, I found your slanderous message on my computer <br/>
after returning from my neighbor lady's house where I performed an <br/>
act of pure civility and grace. I very politely returned a pair of <br/>
her shoes (bright red pumps with 3-inch spike heels and spaghetti <br/>
straps! ...drool) that had recently gone missing by sliding them <br/>
through an open window. I was even thoughtful enough to make sure <br/>
that they were completely dry before returning them!<br/>
<br/>
Have you even determined exactly when the Store of Good Manners went <br/>
missing? I'm certain I can procure a strong alibi. But, it seems to <br/>
me it may have been missing for a long time. For instance, when I've <br/>
gone letterboxing, I have been finding various litter along the trail <br/>
for quite some time now. Candy wrappers, cigarette butts, tissues <br/>
sometimes even items that were carelessly not replaced in the <br/>
letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
But you won't find me committing such atrocities! I am a refined and <br/>
enlightened soul. In fact, I make a habit of carrying out more from <br/>
the trail than I take in with me. I often bring a large garbage bag <br/>
along just for that purpose. I will go out of my way to pick up <br/>
anything I find lying around on the main trail, side trails, and any <br/>
nearby vacant lots, back yards, and unlocked living rooms.<br/>
<br/>
Before you go around suggesting that a gentleman such as myself would <br/>
perpetrate any such offense, I suggest that you do your job and <br/>
investigate a little bit first. Ask the people who know me. They will <br/>
stick up for my impeccable character. Ask my dear friend and <br/>
colleague Stealthboxxer. I'm sure he will tell you that there's no <br/>
way I could be involved in this horrible crime!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmph! An attack on my good friend and co-conspirator Der Mad<br/>
Stamper's reputation must be answered!<br/>
<br/>
Etiquette, schmetiquette, I say. In my experience in knowing him, Der<br/>
Mad One is one of the most courteous, kind, forgiving, gentle,<br/>
peaceful, warm, human, grateful, thoughtful, trustful, childlike,<br/>
witty, happy, wise, tasteless, rude, offensive, obsequious, purple,<br/>
and clairvoyant... wait, strike those last few.... people I have ever<br/>
met. He would never do anything in poor taste or without proper<br/>
etiquette. Now eating and drinking things that taste poor, that's<br/>
another story.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, that reminds me of a story about him that I can share. You<br/>
see, I used to follow DMS around before he knew me to see if he could<br/>
lead me to any secret word of mouth letterboxes. He never knew that I<br/>
was tailing him so I got to witness some of his most candid behavior<br/>
on the letterboxing trail. One day, I was following him around in<br/>
Forest Park while he was chasing down a particularly perplexing series<br/>
of boxes. (I never did figure out those clues but, boy, I am sure<br/>
proud of those stamps in my log book) He was a ways ahead of me on the<br/>
trail and I saw him turn the corner and go out of sight. I ran up to<br/>
the bend in the trail just in time to see him emerge from the brush<br/>
zipping up the fly of his jeans. Then he looked up the trail and then<br/>
turned to look back so I ducked behind a tree. This particular tree<br/>
had a really nice hole that went all the way through and I could look<br/>
through and see him clearly. He apparently did not see me because he<br/>
then reached into his multi-pocketed vest and removed 2 bottles of<br/>
beer and a bottle opener. He had both bottles opened in less than<br/>
three seconds and had drunk down both bottles in less than half a<br/>
minute. That's not so unusual for him, most folks know about his<br/>
penchant for alcoholic refreshments and certainly a long hike on such<br/>
a challenging clue set can work up a good thirst. But what is truly<br/>
noteworthy is what he did next. He very carefully placed both bottles<br/>
into a deep stump on the side of the trail and expertly covered them<br/>
up with moss, duff, and sticks in formal letterboxer style. No one on<br/>
that trail would ever suspect that there were beer bottles hidden in<br/>
that stump...that is unless they had well trained letterboxer's eyes. <br/>
<br/>
You see, there were probably some 196 odd hikers on that same trail<br/>
that early 5am morning and Der Mad Stamper made sure that none of them<br/>
would see any unsightly beer bottles lying along the trail. What is<br/>
that but etiquette excellence?<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Bacon, I am truly offended by your rash attack on such an<br/>
upstanding letterboxing citizen and a close personal friend at that! I<br/>
am henceforth removing you from my e-newsletter list and I am sending<br/>
a recommendation to the Association of Letterboxing Private<br/>
Investigators (ALPI) that you be forthright banned from the group and<br/>
your annual dues be withheld for lack of niceness.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmph!<br/>

&gt; Hmmph! An attack on my good friend and co-conspirator Der Mad<br/>
&gt; Stamper's reputation must be answered!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Etiquette, schmetiquette, I say. In my experience in knowing him, <br/>
Der<br/>
&gt; Mad One is one of the most courteous, kind, forgiving, gentle,<br/>
&gt; peaceful, warm, human, grateful, thoughtful, trustful, childlike,<br/>
&gt; witty, happy, wise, tasteless, rude, offensive, obsequious, purple,<br/>
&gt; and clairvoyant... wait, strike those last few.... people I have <br/>
ever<br/>
&gt; met. He would never do anything in poor taste or without proper<br/>
&gt; etiquette. Now eating and drinking things that taste poor, that's<br/>
&gt; another story.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In fact, that reminds me of a story about him that I can share. You<br/>
&gt; see, I used to follow DMS around before he knew me to see if he <br/>
could<br/>
&gt; lead me to any secret word of mouth letterboxes. He never knew that <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was tailing him so I got to witness some of his most candid behavior<br/>
&gt; on the letterboxing trail. One day, I was following him around in<br/>
&gt; Forest Park while he was chasing down a particularly perplexing <br/>
series<br/>
&gt; of boxes. (I never did figure out those clues but, boy, I am sure<br/>
&gt; proud of those stamps in my log book) He was a ways ahead of me on <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; trail and I saw him turn the corner and go out of sight. I ran up to<br/>
&gt; the bend in the trail just in time to see him emerge from the brush<br/>
&gt; zipping up the fly of his jeans. Then he looked up the trail and <br/>
then<br/>
&gt; turned to look back so I ducked behind a tree. This particular tree<br/>
&gt; had a really nice hole that went all the way through and I could <br/>
look<br/>
&gt; through and see him clearly. He apparently did not see me because he<br/>
&gt; then reached into his multi-pocketed vest and removed 2 bottles of<br/>
&gt; beer and a bottle opener. He had both bottles opened in less than<br/>
&gt; three seconds and had drunk down both bottles in less than half a<br/>
&gt; minute. That's not so unusual for him, most folks know about his<br/>
&gt; penchant for alcoholic refreshments and certainly a long hike on <br/>
such<br/>
&gt; a challenging clue set can work up a good thirst. But what is truly<br/>
&gt; noteworthy is what he did next. He very carefully placed both <br/>
bottles<br/>
&gt; into a deep stump on the side of the trail and expertly covered them<br/>
&gt; up with moss, duff, and sticks in formal letterboxer style. No one <br/>
on<br/>
&gt; that trail would ever suspect that there were beer bottles hidden in<br/>
&gt; that stump...that is unless they had well trained letterboxer's <br/>
eyes. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You see, there were probably some 196 odd hikers on that same trail<br/>
&gt; that early 5am morning and Der Mad Stamper made sure that none of <br/>
them<br/>
&gt; would see any unsightly beer bottles lying along the trail. What is<br/>
&gt; that but etiquette excellence?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mr. Bacon, I am truly offended by your rash attack on such an<br/>
&gt; upstanding letterboxing citizen and a close personal friend at <br/>
that! I<br/>
&gt; am henceforth removing you from my e-newsletter list and I am <br/>
sending<br/>
&gt; a recommendation to the Association of Letterboxing Private<br/>
&gt; Investigators (ALPI) that you be forthright banned from the group <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; your annual dues be withheld for lack of niceness.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmmph!<br/>

&gt; &gt; My dear Investigator Bacon,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My, how soon you have turned on me now that you are no longer on <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; payroll! But by pointing a finger at me, you've only hurt your <br/>
own <br/>
&gt; &gt; reputation as a crime solver. Anyone with any brains at all will <br/>
see <br/>
&gt; &gt; that your charges are unfounded and completely ridiculous.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; For starters, everyone knows that no matter how much tequila you <br/>
give <br/>
&gt; &gt; me, there isn't a chance that anything could slip from my lips <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; would make any sense to you or anyone else! Can you honestly <br/>
think of <br/>
&gt; &gt; even 1 single occasion where such an event has transpired? I <br/>
think <br/>
&gt; &gt; not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And you can inform that Post Toastie client of yours that I am <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; living embodiment of good manners. Have you already forgotten how <br/>
&gt; &gt; willing I was to share the worm with you from the bottom of that <br/>
&gt; &gt; expensive bottle of Mescal on the morning after my precious PZ <br/>
Kut <br/>
&gt; &gt; was stolen?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In fact, just today, I found your slanderous message on my <br/>
computer <br/>
&gt; &gt; after returning from my neighbor lady's house where I performed <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; &gt; act of pure civility and grace. I very politely returned a pair <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; her shoes (bright red pumps with 3-inch spike heels and spaghetti <br/>
&gt; &gt; straps! ...drool) that had recently gone missing by sliding them <br/>
&gt; &gt; through an open window. I was even thoughtful enough to make sure <br/>
&gt; &gt; that they were completely dry before returning them!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Have you even determined exactly when the Store of Good Manners <br/>
went <br/>
&gt; &gt; missing? I'm certain I can procure a strong alibi. But, it seems <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; me it may have been missing for a long time. For instance, when <br/>
I've <br/>
&gt; &gt; gone letterboxing, I have been finding various litter along the <br/>
trail <br/>
&gt; &gt; for quite some time now. Candy wrappers, cigarette butts, <br/>
tissues <br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes even items that were carelessly not replaced in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But you won't find me committing such atrocities! I am a refined <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; enlightened soul. In fact, I make a habit of carrying out more <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; &gt; the trail than I take in with me. I often bring a large garbage <br/>
bag <br/>
&gt; &gt; along just for that purpose. I will go out of my way to pick up <br/>
&gt; &gt; anything I find lying around on the main trail, side trails, and <br/>
any <br/>
&gt; &gt; nearby vacant lots, back yards, and unlocked living rooms.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Before you go around suggesting that a gentleman such as myself <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; &gt; perpetrate any such offense, I suggest that you do your job and <br/>
&gt; &gt; investigate a little bit first. Ask the people who know me. They <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; &gt; stick up for my impeccable character. Ask my dear friend and <br/>
&gt; &gt; colleague Stealthboxxer. I'm sure he will tell you that there's <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; &gt; way I could be involved in this horrible crime!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; As you are aware I have been hired by Emily Post to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; investigate what she thinks is a crime. I have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; agree with her, The Store of Good Manners is missing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I believe that there just might be a goodly number of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers involved in a crime of this magnitude.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Have no doubt, I will find the guilty parties! <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Der Mad Stamper, are you reading? You might have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; able to pull off your innocence in the PZKut caper,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but were you really innocent? While under the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; influence of tequila you let slip a secret that is now<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; making sense to me. You were awfully quick to blame<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; others. Did another letterboxer get the short end of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the stick? Just what is your involvement in this<br/>
