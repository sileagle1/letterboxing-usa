Myakka River State Park Sarasota, Fl<br/>
Planted 11-24-2000<br/>
<br/>
Find you way to Myakka River State Park east of Sarasota Fl. It is a <br/>
huge park (45 square miles) with many hiking and camping trails that <br/>
preserves the best of primitive Florida wilderness. There are many <br/>
things to do there including seeing the biggest alligators you are <br/>
likely to have ever seen in the wild, fishing, taking airboat rides, <br/>
canoeing, hiking, and bird watching.  Ah.. but there is something <br/>
else you are likely to find unlike anywhere else. A place to take a <br/>
nature walk in the tree tops and climb to the sky. When you take the <br/>
last step to view the sky look straight ahead to the forest below. To <br/>
your left it will border a meadow/marsh. Once you come down from the <br/>
sky, walk along the border of the forest and the meadow for about 100 <br/>
feet or so and look for a tangle of fallen trees. The box will be <br/>
found. Please make sure to put it back as found (not on the ground) <br/>
because the area floods during heavy rains. Also please send me a <br/>
note if you look for it and tell me about your hunt (elm@ao.net).<br/>
