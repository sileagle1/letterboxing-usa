                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, can anyone give me a hand. I have been trying to reach Jim. The guy who is taking <br/>
care of the LBNA Medallions. I sent him the money at the very beginning of August. I <br/>
haven't received anything yet.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have dropped Jim 3 emails and  have had no answer. Does anyone know how to <br/>
reach him? or know Jim? I ordered 4 medallions for my family and my kids are really <br/>
excited to get them.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone received their medallions already. I am just sort of wondering what is going <br/>
on. I hope I haven't just sent out $20 cash and will get nothing in return but a lesson <br/>
learned. <br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
I heard from Jim. He stated that there was a delay on the medallions. <br/>
He confirmed receipt of my money and order and promised to send them <br/>
out as soon as the medallions arrive. I guess I was just impatient. So, <br/>
if anyone else out there was worried, sounds like Jim is on top of it.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your responses<br/>
