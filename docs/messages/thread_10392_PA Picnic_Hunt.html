Here are some of the things we did at the first Ct gather in <br/>
Tolland/Vernon.  We had a carving contest , folks brought a stamp <br/>
they had carved and its image on paper in the color they thought was <br/>
best suited. We had categories and age groups. <br/>
<br/>
We had a few fun - for the day only boxes some indoors and some out. <br/>
<br/>
We played a couple group games ask Allan from Axetown about <br/>
Grandmothers Backpack! That was a fun game! <br/>
<br/>
We ate and there was a stamping frenzy<br/>
<br/>
name tags had our stamp as well as our names on them<br/>
<br/>
We had a log book for the gather like a guest book another gather I <br/>
ran I had everyone stamp in on a poster which was great fun<br/>
<br/>
We had extra clues to local boxes available especially boxes  very <br/>
recently put out.<br/>
<br/>
In some local boxes there were suprises. Maybe a pen wrapped in paper <br/>
or a new ink just little momento gifts no one new what town or box <br/>
had a gift - very random.  <br/>
<br/>
A hitch hiker was launched from the gather and a couple were in town <br/>
for the occasion<br/>
<br/>
of course there was an event stamp - available only to the attendees<br/>
<br/>
It was a great day and yours will be too. Letterboxers know how to <br/>
have fun and can't wait to greet a new friend!  Really hoping to be <br/>
there myself I'll mark the calendar. <br/>
