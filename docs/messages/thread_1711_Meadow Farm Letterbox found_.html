<div>Hello all,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My first letterbox!  I only discovered letterboxing in the past couple 
of weeks but it looks like a lot of fun.  It also looks like a great 
activity for my son's cub scout den so I've planned a meeting around it and 
wanted to have them find one of the letterboxes in Richmond.  However, I 
wanted to make sure that the box was still there (and I knew where it was) 
before getting the whole den out there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So today during lunch two of my co-workers and I headed out to the Meadow 
Farm Museum near Richmond, Virginia.  It's a beautiful (if cold) day here 
and perfect for a walk through the woods.  Sure enough, the box was right 
where it should be.  It was planted January 30, 2000 and we were apparently 
the first to find it as there were no other stamps in the book.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Letterboxing has a least three new converts and we plan to search out the 
Belle Isle box next week and then start planting our own!</div>

<div>Welcome aboard Steve. 
Have a run up here to Fredericksburg. I just planted 3 easy boxes for the kids 
in south stafford county. I have been out of Cubs for about 7 years now (My son, 
Sam, 18, just finished his Eagle this past summer). The Webelow's activity pins 
would be great subject to carve into stamps. To start, grab any kind of firm 
eraser you can find and have at it. My site shows a couple of examples of the 
boxes and logbooks that you could use.  I also just discovered the ring 
bound 3x5 cards (thanks to the Drew clan box in Washington) at Wal-mart. They 
were .93 for 50 bound cards. I used a pair of plyers, and removed the metal ring 
binder, split them into 25 card logbooks, cut the binder in half, and made two 
log books. Cheap at half the price. If you have anymore questions just throw 
them on the elist and you will have more answers then you can read.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am also the LbNA 
Webmaster for VA, so drop me an email direct if you want to find out what it 
takes to get your upcoming box clues published on the LbNA sight.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also check out the KIDS 
section on letterboxing.org. It has some great suggestions for kids 
stamps.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Good 
Hunting</div>
