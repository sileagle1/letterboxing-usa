<div>In 1938 Prince Henry Sinclair, from Orkney 
Islands, Scotland, and a group of friendly Micmaq indians camped on the cape. 
Prince Sinclair built a ship on the shore of Advocate  Harbor and 
when  the Indians looked down at the ship they called it a floating 
island.  </div>
<div>   Red Rocks Letterbox, West Advocate, 
Nova Scotia, Canada.  From Parrsboro take Rte 209 to West Advocate 
traveling to the end of the paved road and when facing the water on that road, 
just where it intersects the old public road, the letterbox is located under the 
largest boulder at the end of the old road 22 feet from the new road. Visit the 
beautiful Red Rocks on the beach here .There is no safe place from the vengence 
of winter and the sea to hide a box at the actual rocks but they are worth the 
visit. </div>
<div>    This box was planted by 
Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H club Grandparents. Many thank-yous to them for expanding 
our trail of  boxes beyond the shores of our 
nation.</div></body></html>
