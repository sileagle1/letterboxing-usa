J. Travis Price Park<br/>
Springfield, TN, Robertson County<br/>
Difficulty: very easy<br/>

<br/>
driving directions: Robertson County, whose main crop (at least until <br/>
it became taboo) is tobacco, is just north of Nashville, bordering <br/>
the KY/TN state line. Springfield, the county seat, is pretty much in <br/>
the middle of the county. Hwy 41 is the main north/south route <br/>
through the county and goes right through Springfield. One mile north <br/>
of the intersection of Hwy 41 and Hwy 49 (aka Memorial Blvd &amp; 10th <br/>
Ave) you will see the Robertson County Fairgrounds. Turn on Blackwood <br/>
Drive next to the fairgrounds. You will see a blue sign for J. Travis <br/>
Price Park. Drive one mile and the park entrance will be on your <br/>
left. Enter the park and drive .4 mile and park at the parking area <br/>
next to the "Adventure Playground."<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
In the middle of the Adventure Playground area is an historic <br/>
cemetery that is at least 200 yrs old...Most of the stones are no <br/>
longer legible. Begin at the gate of the cemetery fence. Walk 165 <br/>
degrees for 20 paces to a fallen headstone that reads: "Sallie A. <br/>
Porter b. June 14, 1847 d. June 25, 1883." (My birthday, sans 1883!) <br/>
Stand facing Sallie's grave and walk 270 degrees about 14 paces to a <br/>
very old cedar tree in the SW corner of the cemetery. Tobacco Patch <br/>
#1 is hidden about waist-high in this tree. Go back out of the <br/>
cemetery and around to stand across the fence from the cedar tree <br/>
where you found box #1 (or, if you are athletic, hop the fence). Walk <br/>
about 29 paces to the south, you will reach a tube slide that goes <br/>
down the hill. If you want to feel like a kid again, take a ride down <br/>
the slide, or if you prefer, walk down the hill.  Standing at the <br/>
bottom of the slide, walk SW about 12 paces to the dry (at least in <br/>
August) creekbed. You should be standing in front of 3 trees, the <br/>
middle one on the other side of the creek bed. Tobacco Patch #2 is in <br/>
the backside of the middle tree, at the base. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
