                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can relate to your problem; I live in New Orleans and the humidity <br/>
here is bad.  My first box was placed in late Nov. last year and just <br/>
recently checked on it and just as you said there was water in it.  <br/>
So off to the store I went to get Ziplocks and bag up my log books in <br/>
all my other boxes.  The next box I checked had another surprise for <br/>
me, the lid was bubbled out like air had been pumped in it <br/>
(atmospheric pressure change?) and it to had trace amounts of water.  <br/>
So I suggest all log books to be put into ziplocks.  If you are going <br/>
to use silicon gels and you need something to put them try using an <br/>
old pair of the wifes sockings.  I don't know if this will work but <br/>
everyone down here uses rice in their salt shakers to keep the <br/>
humidity from messing up the salt in the shakers; popcorn also <br/>
works.  Although using these may attract some varments to your box <br/>
and then that little bit of water wasn't really a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Is it the heat or is it the stupidity!!!<br/>

Has anyone checked to see if Rubbermaid or Ziplock stock has gone up <br/>
since this sport started?<br/>
