                    <div class="plaintext-content">"In Michael's $1 bin I found some mini note pads, with a pen! I picked <br/>
up several for planting in future projects. They are approx. 4"x4-<br/>
1/2", 100 blank (unlined) sheets, include a small pen, and made <br/>
by "Studio 18". "<br/>
<br/>
Be careful you do actually get the ones with the pens.  When I went they also had some really cute matchbook-type books in the same bin, some even with matching or coordinating covers.  I bought them, brought them home, and discovered...the ones with the pens are unlined.  The matchbook books (both the thick and the thin ones) are...beautiful lined noteboks that will be going in my christmas stockings this year.<br/>
<br/>
But I also find, at the end of each "season" that the books with the pens get moved to the clearance bin and marked down to fifty cents...so the summer ones were cheap as I got mine in september, and the christmas ones were full price.<br/>
