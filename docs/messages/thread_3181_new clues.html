Letterbox Clues for two new letterboxes placed by Rainbow’s End:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Potato Creek Letterbox<br/>
State Road 4<br/>
North Liberty, Indiana<br/>
St. Joseph County<br/>
Place August 20, 2001<br/>
<br/>
Enter Potato Creek State Park.  If possible, ask for a park map at the Visitors Center.  Find your way to the Quaking Aspen Picnic Area, close to the entrance gate house.  Begin your hike at eastern point of Trail Head #3 (there are 2 points to this loop trail).  Shortly after you begin your hike into the woods, you will come upon a wonderful overlook of Potato Creek.  Be sure to take the time to read the informational placard!  After you think you have absorbed the information, continue your hike along the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Soon you will come upon a wonderful bridge.  Cross both legs of the bridge at stop at the end of the bridge.  Take the year in which the partnership was created and the creek was dammed and multiply that number by 1.1% or .011.  Take those number of paces due north from the end of the second leg of the bridge and you will discover a dinosaur egg in the woods.  (Please do not move it)  Now go northwest from the egg 14 paces.  This should bring you to the foot of a fallen tree and the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
We encourage you to finish the loop trail…enjoy learning about the deer study area and enjoy the boardwalk with a view of the lake.<br/>
<br/>

Birthday Letterbox<br/>
Placed August 26, 2001<br/>
(Second Letterbox at Saugatuck Dunes State Park, Holland, Michigan – Ottawa County)<br/>
<br/>
Begin your adventure on the Beach Trail from the parking lot.  Follow the posts marked with a yellow painted top and a green arrowhead.  Enjoy this wonderful sandy trail through the forest.  When you come to a split in the trail, stay on the path as marked by the posts.  When you come to the high point on the trail, stay to the right and you will begin a long gradual decent (also great on cross county skis in the winter!)  Just before you get to the end of the trail, you will see a glimpse Lake Michigan, and an old abandoned concrete block building on your left.  Take the trail to the right that goes northwest.  Soon you will emerge from the woods and see the lake in front of you (resist going to the lake for right now).  From the top of this dune, look northeast for a trail that heads back into the woods.  There will be two forks, one marked by a post top painted all yellow, and one post top marked with both yellow and white.  Take this latter trail.  You will now head back i!<br/>
nto a younger, less mature fores<br/>
t.  Soon this connector trail will dead end into another trail.  Turn left, toward the lake and go to the top of this dune.  Enjoy the view.  Looking due west into the bowl in front of you, you will see a large, tall pine tree.  Descend into the bowl and go to this tree.  From this pine tree, go due south approximately 60 paces.  You will see an old, gnarled pine tree, not too tall but with large branches spread down low on the sand.  (He stands close to some oak trees)  At the base of this pine tree you will find the birthday letterbox!<br/>

Pelican Man<br/>
Sarasota Florida (southwest Florida )<br/>
Sarasota County<br/>
Difficulty:easy <br/>
Placed: December 23,2001<br/>
<br/>
Ahhhh Welcome to sunny Sarasota, Florida, truly it is, as they say,<br/>
"Paradise". <br/>
My internet friend for over 2 years, John, has sent me a letterbox to<br/>
place while I am in Sarasota for the winter. Well John, thinking that<br/>
this is a neat hobby I just had to give this a try. <br/>
<br/>
There are many neat things to do here in the area and Mote Marine and<br/>
Pelican Man Sanctuary are right next to each other and would make a nice<br/>
day trip for those looking for something good to do. Pelican Man<br/>
Sanctuary has been a favorite spot for us to take out of town visitors.<br/>
I love to go when the pelicans are nesting and have their fuzzy new born<br/>
babies. It is so neat to be up close and see these birds. They have all<br/>
kinds of other birds there too.  Dale Shields, the man that had this<br/>
dream to help injured birds, has been amazing. I have seen him there<br/>
twice and it is fun to be there when he is there.. The birds...and even<br/>
local squirrels know him and approach for a hand out. A website that may<br/>
be of interest is: <br/>
