&gt;Very excited about your new plants.  I plan to be in Nebraska 12/26- <br/>

I'm bummed that I missed this until now (cleaning up the email after the <br/>
holiday break, of course.).<br/>
<br/>
I planted one more around here, but not the cowboy trail <br/>
ones.  Unfortunately, my knee's still not up to the kind of gravel-road <br/>
biking it requires yet.  But I did scout it out a bit. :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, Norfolk's about two and a half hours from Lincoln, depending on how <br/>
much you don't mind breaking the law while speeding.  Two boxes (and easy <br/>
ones, at that) might not be worth the trip down yet, but I'd gladly spring <br/>
for lunch if you ever get back this way. :)  (Goes for the rest of you <br/>
NE/midwest letterbox folks, too.  And the WA letterboxers know me and can <br/>
vouch that I'm not TOO much of a psycho.)<br/>
<br/>
I'm teaching a class on carving rubber stamps here in Norfolk in February, <br/>
and plan on having them place letterboxes all over down here.  I figure if <br/>
there's about fifty of these puppies up this way, it'll make the drive <br/>
worth it for the out-of-staters. :)<br/>

</p><p>Chances are when I am in Nebraska I will be sticking pretty close to Lincoln visiting my brother and his family.  Irishtinker and I did get them hooked on letterboxing.  They planted one in Lincoln while I was visiting and I bet they will be planting more soon.  Maybe they will be in the Norfolk area and check out your boxes. I printed all the area clues for them.  Let me know if you are in Lincoln and get the East meets West box. We got Son of Corn Husker while I was visiting and only one other person had been there.!       Happy boxing.... Odilio
