&gt; It might be a little messier since you're more likely to get ink on <br/>

When i first read Ryan's post an possible solution sprang to mind...I <br/>
use good old fashioned fountain pens. For those who don't then you <br/>
dont know that fountain pen ink is slower to dry than ballpoint pens, <br/>
smears easily and will bleed through most anypaper placed atop it <br/>
while still wet. so, how do i deal with this?? A blotter, rocker <br/>
blotter to be exact. Ok, she's running on again...<br/>
why not mount your stamp on a slightly rounded block instead of a <br/>
flat one? then you simply rock the stamp over the ink pad and rock <br/>
the impression onto the paper...<br/>
Another suggestion for mounting glue: E600 craft clue..its thick but <br/>
will secure most anything. I use it in jewelry making and have found <br/>
it to be very waterproof.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Please allow me to share something......  Speaking to a good friend of mine who is a ex-Carving Consortium and now an EraserCuts person, who has been carving for over 20 years, I asked her what her thoughts were on this.  She shared this......<br/>
<br/>
"Anything that is made out of a flexible material will bend if not backed properly.  Just look at commercial laser cut stamps.  The problems you are experiencing are most likely coming from the material being stamped bending slightly. We overcome this by either stamping on a firm hard surface or using a rocker blotter, although I suspect that may not be feasible in the situations you are describing. I have the advantage that everything I stamp, I am able to stamp on a hard, firm surface."<br/>
<br/>
As far as the glue, that's a personal choice, much like Religion, Politics and Operating Systems!  (grin)  I use 'GOOP' and have used E6000 Craft glue and even 'Gorilla Glue'.  I've got about 12 different types of glue in my woodshop and each works on different things.  The 3 I mentioned earlier have all worked for me.<br/>
