Located in Rockingham County<br/>
Nearest town: McGaheysville<br/>
Terrain: level to very steep but total distance to all three is not <br/>
much more than a mile.<br/>
<br/>
The city of Harrisonburg straddles Interstate 81.  If you are <br/>
traveling on 81 take exit 247A which will bring you out on Rt 33 <br/>
heading east.  Drive for 10-12 miles and watch for brown signs about <br/>
Massanutten Resort.  Turn left at the sun on the mountain sign <br/>
(Resort Dr.).  Turn left at the 3 tall flagpoles.  You will be going <br/>
through the resort checkpoint (guard house).  The resort is open to <br/>
the public for skiing, a mini golf course and a restaurant so just <br/>
wave at the nice guard as you go through.  (Best not to have any <br/>
open liquor containers, weapons or expired inspection stickers as <br/>
you smile and wave!)  If they want to know your business you can say <br/>
you are heading to Fareways (the restaurant). <br/>
<br/>
You don't have far to go now.  Take the first left to the Park <br/>
Entrance.  There is a tiny parking area straight ahead at the <br/>
entrance to the Arboretum.  Park and look for the map.  Before you <br/>
begin to search remember that this is a very busy resort area and <br/>
the Arboretum is small  be very discreet.  <br/>
<br/>
Your first bird can be found under a bridge near the "bog monster".  <br/>
The bridge rhymes with That and has a double waterfall to gaze at.   <br/>
Cross over the bridge and exit around to the left, find the flat <br/>
rock and peek underneath.  If you are very lucky you will find the <br/>
shy Carolina Wren. <br/>
<br/>
Once you have wre-hidden the wren, continue on the path a very short <br/>
way to an intersection with a thin sapling posing as a traffic cop.  <br/>
Take a right.  You'll know you took the right path if you have to <br/>
scootch down to avoid the low hanging bush and step over the log.  <br/>
Very soon now you will begin to ascend steeply.  Keep on straight,  <br/>
taking no turns, through the moss carpet lining the trail and past <br/>
the very long thin fallen log.  Looking ahead you will see a sign <br/>
that says "Private Property - No Trespassing"  you may even see a <br/>
car or two.  When you get about 40-50 ft away from the sign you will <br/>
see a trail to your left that goes dooowwwnn.  To find the next bird <br/>
you will have to observe the trees very carefully.  As you turn onto <br/>
this trail straight ahead you will see a very tall, straight, <br/>
barkless, dead tree leaning into its neighbor.  Descend about 10-15 <br/>
paces and look to your right.  The next tree you are looking for is <br/>
a twisty, twirly dead tree (TTDT) which has been feasted upon by the <br/>
very bird you are searching for.  The healthy neighbor tree stands <br/>
between the TTDT and a fallen portion of the TTDT.  Make your way <br/>
(there is a small trail leading over) over to the fallen portion and <br/>
search between it and the healthy neighbor.  Here you will find the <br/>
Pileated Woodpecker.  If you are very lucky you will hear him laugh <br/>
at you pawing through the leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the main (downward) trail (not all the way back up to the <br/>
sign yet) and look down  see the benches and the bridge?  You can <br/>
go straight down here but you may find yourself sliding out of <br/>
control on your bottom unless you are very careful.  Adventurous <br/>
and/or really well-coordinated?  Go for it!  Head for the Boy Scout <br/>
Bridge!  <br/>
<br/>
Cautious and/or accident-prone?  Head back up to the ridge trail and <br/>
back to the traffic cop sapling.  At that point take a right and <br/>
look for the Boy Scout Bridge. Cross over and take a right to the <br/>
Water Garden held in place by the stone dam.  To find your last bird <br/>
you will need to cross the dam (or take the tiny little bridge <br/>
over).  Look around the end of the dam on the downstream side. Have <br/>
a good reason for your suspicious actions if someone asks!  This is <br/>
the most exposed box location.  Even if it isn't night you should <br/>
catch a glimpse of the Eastern Screech Owl and capture him into your <br/>
logbook!   <br/>
<br/>
If you are a birder you can see lots of wonderful birds in this <br/>
little park particularly if you come early in the morning.  <br/>
