year, and it is coming up.  I just want to get the message out to other <br/>
letterboxers to take advantage of this:<br/>
<br/>
Next month, Saturday, September 27, 2008 is free museum day across the <br/>
county, at Smithsonian Affiliated Museums.  You need to get a coupon at <br/>
this site http://microsite.smithsonianmag.com/museumday/about.html  <br/>
Make sure you get one coupon per each 2 people including kids (4 <br/>
people - you need 2 coupons).  Remember if you plan to go to 2 <br/>
different museums on free day (which I have done in the past) be sure <br/>
to print out a coupon per each museum you plan to visit that day.  The <br/>
site lists what museums, by state, are participating in the free museum <br/>
day.  This is my third year participating.  It's a great deal. <br/>
I took the liberty of looking to see what museums are included for a <br/>
few locations.  I'm not sure of other people's cities, but all of you <br/>
can look up to see what is free in your own state or in an area you <br/>
might be thinking about visiting.<br/>
