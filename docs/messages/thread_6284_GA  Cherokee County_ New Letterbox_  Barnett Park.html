<br/>
Letterbox Name: Barnett Park: This is one example of several "little league" ball parks in Cherokee County. Athletics and <br/>
eating out are two favorite activities in the county! <br/>
<br/>
Location: 10795 Bells Ferry Road. If you get off I-575 at Exit 14, turn left, then go about a mile to the intersection with <br/>
Butterworth Road (at Pizza Hut), you can turn left on Butterworth.  At the four-way stop turn left on Bell's Ferry Road, and go <br/>
about 0.7 miles. Park is on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: A lovely and easy walk with benches, picnic tables, and a playground available. Only a short walk into the woods will <br/>
get you to the box.<br/>

Clues:<br/>
l. Before you begin your hunt, you will need the following information:<br/>
 a. What is the zipcode for the town in which the National Baseball Hall of Fame is located?<br/>
 b. What is "Hammerin'" Hank Aaron's year of birth?<br/>
 c. What is the uniform number of the 2002 Atlanta Braves player Javy Lopez?<br/>
<br/>
2.When you get into the Park, you can park near the restrooms, then walk down a paved path on the east side.<br/>
<br/>
3. If, as you get to the first bend in the path, the light pole on the right has the same number on it as the last number of the year <br/>
Hank Aaron was born, you're on the right path.<br/>
<br/>
4.On the webpage there are photos of some of the places you will  encounter as you walk the path. Brought along a picnic??  <br/>
Stop and eat. Have kids along? Let them play on the playground and in the creek.    Continue across the bridge and down the <br/>
paved path.<br/>
<br/>
5. Add the first four digits of the zipcode you obtained for the Hall of Fame, and look for a light pole with that number. Found it? <br/>
Good! <br/>
<br/>
6. Now with your back to that pole, sight toward the light pole that has the same number as the uniform number for Javy <br/>
Lopez. Extend your right arm, thumbs up. About a thumb's width or less to the right of the "Lopez Pole" is a small white-barked <br/>
tree.<br/>
<br/>
7. Pace Calibration: From the "Lopez Pole", the tree is 150 degrees at about 20 paces. Go to the tree.<br/>
<br/>
8. The old 3-leaved nemesis is around the tree and surroundings. Poison Ivy! Be careful if you are allergic to the oils of this <br/>
plant. <br/>
<br/>
9. It's time to go to the woods. From the tree, the letterbox is under some small fallen pine trees: 205 degrees at about 12 <br/>
paces. <br/>
<br/>
10. Found it?? Wonderful! Exchange stamp impressions, make any comments in the book you wish, then carefully replace the <br/>
box. If you have found any problems with the box, please send email to Jimmus and SpikesMom.<br/>
<br/>
Please Note: The usual disclaimers apply:<br/>
You are responsible for your own safety. Do not trespass on private property.  Be aware of animals, plants, and environmental <br/>
situations that might put you, and others with you, in danger. It is a good policy to wear brightly colored vests and caps in the <br/>
woods during hunting seasons.<br/>
