                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is probably not a good idea to leave a HH in a hybrid <br/>
letterbox/geo-cache.  Not only is it too easily mistaken for the geo-<br/>
caching trade trinkets, but if it is found by a geo-cacher, it <br/>
creates confusion as to whether is it a letterboxing HH or a geo-<br/>
caching travel bug.  Furthermore, if said geo-cachers are not <br/>
letterboxers, the chances of the HH moving on to the next letterbox <br/>
are greatly diminished.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, one would think that labeling would clarify that, apparently <br/>
not.  Labels and loose pieces of paper tend to be lost over time <br/>
anyway.  I just received an e-mail from some folks who found one of <br/>
my HH, inquiring as to the instructions (?) for him and noting that <br/>
he was not a "registered travel bug."<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am misinterpretting the circumstances, but it appears he is <br/>
being confused with a geo-caching traveler, even though he started <br/>
out very clearly marked with letterboxing info.<br/>
