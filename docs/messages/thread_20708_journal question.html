(hehe, not a newbie question, more of a poll question)<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering, what does everyone's journal "look like"?  Do <br/>
you just stamp in it, or do you add pictures (like a scrap book)?  I <br/>
was just curious.  I have young kids (ages 7,7,4) and I keep it like <br/>
a scrap book.<br/>

Cool.  Let me rephrase my answer.  It's not in scrap book form <br/>
(mounting, diecuts, etc).  I just trim the photos (so the fit the <br/>
journal) and glue them in.<br/>

What we do is we print out our clues on nice paper-kind of  watercolered <br/>
tannish-to make it look like a pirate map.  We take  pictures along the way...if a <br/>
clue leads us to something cool or we pass  by a spot along the way we like.  <br/>
We stamp the cluesheet, date and  comment.  When we get the photos developed <br/>
we put it all nicely in a  photo album.  Might not be the best way to do it, <br/>
but we like  it.<br/>

I have a blank book with a Unicorn theme that a friend gave me as a<br/>
gift several years before I started letterboxing.  In addition to<br/>
stamps, the box has directions for solving secret codes, obscure<br/>
measurements, first finder certificates, and if the park issues them,<br/>
a map of where I found the letterbox.<br/>
