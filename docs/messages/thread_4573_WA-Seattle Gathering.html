I'm so glad to hear you will be coming out this way.  I'm not sure what<br/>
our plans for Memorial Day weekend are at this point (gotta check with<br/>
da man and see what's up).  I sure would like to meet you two.  I think<br/>
we should greet YOU with rootbeer and grapes as you've done for so many<br/>
back east!!!  We'd give you the good stuff -- Henry Weinhard's Root<br/>
Beer.  It's what they made during prohibition when they couldn't crank<br/>
out the "real" stuff.  (I'm not a beer drinker at all, but I sure love<br/>
Henry's Root Beer!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...to make a long story longer it would be nice to meet you, but<br/>
I'm not sure what the mister has up his sleeve.  Any chance you will be<br/>
coming South just a tad to visit the Rose City (Portland) during your<br/>
trip to the Pacific NW?<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Hope you guys out there in WA/OR have a great time at your gathering <br/>
next week.  We are still committed to coming out to Seattle for <br/>
Memorial Day for the international folk festival there, but we will <br/>
also try to visit Portland, and perhaps meet as many of you folks out <br/>
there as we can at that time!<br/>
