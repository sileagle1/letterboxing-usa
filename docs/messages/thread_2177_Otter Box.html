sent flying off the dike to the rocky liff below. Timmy and I spotted <br/>
fragments and I carefully climbed down to retrieve them. I ignored <br/>
the little red sign tat said stay off the rocks. MY LETTERBOX WAS IN <br/>
PERIL! Timmy hollerd "Mom you know what.......you're crazy" .  The <br/>
otter box is home ready to go to a new nearby location when I get it <br/>
a new box. The old one cracked on the  rocks. Sorry you missed it <br/>
Wanda and Pete maybe when you are in the area again. Hope you liked <br/>
Paddle to the Sea. <br/>
    Mellissa and Dan, Timmy doesn't go to S.E. school but I work <br/>
there . It's only 3 miles from home, his school is Vinton. Glad to <br/>
see you were at that box the school kids will be checking in to see <br/>
who has visited.  <br/>
    By the way all, Vinton school promotes a family No T.V. Week and <br/>
they have lots of special events. One this year will be a <br/>
letterboxing workshop I'm doing for families. I will have boxes <br/>
hidden in and outside the building for the evening and will teach <br/>
them in teams. They can then go out and get started.  Watch for an <br/>
explosion of interest after that busy night I hope itgoes well. <br/>
