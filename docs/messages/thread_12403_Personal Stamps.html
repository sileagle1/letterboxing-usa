The Alphabet Bandits have uploaded their personal stamps to the photos section, in the folder "Alphabet Bandits"<br/>
<br/>
I'm proud of my first efforts (patting myself on the back)  Krazy Kiwi was the very first one I've ever done. Then came Cheetah Chick, Daring Dragonfly, Beautiful Butterfly, Then Talking Turtle and finally Lascivious Lion.<br/>
<br/>
All but LL were done with the "pink stuff"  LL was done with Staedtler Master Carve.  I love the Master Carve. Its a very smooth cut.  I use a Dremel roto tool with an engraving bit and a disposable scalple (sp?) for the fine details.<br/>
<br/>
Talking Turtle<br/>
