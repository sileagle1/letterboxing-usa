It would be helpful to a few people if people who planted boxes or <br/>
visited boxes would comment on the accessibility of the path of <br/>
travel to reach the box.<br/>
<br/>
I had suggested this to a Mensa group years ago.  Instead of "Not <br/>
wheelchair accessible" and "Wheelchair accessible" we settled on <br/>
comments on the difficulty, e.g., "lots of stairs", "requires good <br/>
climbing ability", "flat all the way", etc.   My husband uses a <br/>
power wheel chair.  We were able to go to our 1st box in Salt Water <br/>
State Park, Washington.  Jim could get to the site with just a <br/>
little assistance.  ...and I unhooked the blackberry branches which <br/>
had temporarily captured him.  <g>  He couldn't reach the stones <br/>
which needed to be moved, but he got all the way to the site.  He <br/>
would also easily get to the one at the promontory at Crab Cove, <br/>
Alameda, CA (in our own backyard, walking &amp; rolling distance).<br/>
<br/>
We are not asking for all box sites to be ADA accessible!  Good <br/>
grief!  Just as Half Dome in Yosemite is not accessible, there are <br/>
many places in the world which should never be made accessible.  <g><br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very good point, just recently I found myself pondering this exact <br/>
same question as I placed boxes in a local park that had almost <br/>
complete wheel chair acces to my boxes. (which would be subjective I <br/>
suppose, as to how paved/or barked trail is really accesible, and the <br/>
person's ability) Contemplating that the person in the chair, would <br/>
need another along to actually get the box in some, but.... why <br/>
should they be left out?  I find it hard occasionally for myself who <br/>
is always trekking along with a stroller to decipher which box clues <br/>
I could go on and which not. (this is not a complaint, just another <br/>
challenge, lol, of boxing) I take my chances and get in some harry <br/>
spots occasionally, but then, dd will grow out of her wheels soon <br/>
enough!  On my clues I try to specify that I did the whole thing with <br/>
a stroller and the type of trails, but... I would never expect <br/>
everyone to, that's what makes it so interesting!  I believe I may <br/>
add a wheelchair accesibility rating to my boxes soon tho!  Good idea <br/>
and good luck.   Wingnut<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually I am beginning to think that I should mention trail <br/>
difficulty in my clues. When we go letterboxing, we only have to <br/>
worry about ourselves, we don't have kids or a stroller or even a <br/>
wheelchair to consider and sometimes I don't think about that <br/>
when I am putting my clues online. I will make an effort to include <br/>
that info from now on so we can include more people in this <br/>
great hobby. This is also a good time to mention Silent Doug's <br/>
letterbox rating system. You answer a few questions on his site <br/>
and it determines the trail difficulty for you. Pretty handy actually.<br/>

When you posted about your trip to Salt Water SP I was surprised <br/>
that a wheelchair was able to make it on this venue.<br/>
<br/>
I try to give some hint as to ease of use for people with special <br/>
needs ( elderly or the very young tots in tow) , but with the <br/>
technology of wheelchairs racing ahead, it is clear that I do not <br/>
have a good feeling for what would or would not be accessable for <br/>
chair users.<br/>
<br/>
Certainly if anyone contacted me about my opinion of accessability, <br/>
I would be more than happy to give feed back on my  boxes or boxes I <br/>
have visited.<br/>
