While you are checking on the "Flag" functions can you consider <br/>
looking at a function that would give off an automatic message when <br/>
someone uses the "contact the placer" function.<br/>
It would possibly serve several roles if we had choices such as:<br/>
<br/>
#1 I'm on vacation and can't respond.<br/>
<br/>
#2 I'm too busy and can't respond at this time.<br/>
<br/>
#3 I do not wish to add anything to my clues.<br/>
<br/>
#4 ?<br/>
<br/>
If we had an automatic message function that could be turned on or <br/>
off, then when we go on an extended vacation finders won't assume that <br/>
the letterbox is missing when they do not receive a return note.<br/>

OK. Work has been hairier than usual during the last <br/>
couple months, but I'll try to add a select list in member <br/>
services for it. I'm thinking that the message would <br/>
display boldly near the top of the contact the placer page <br/>
before they enter anything but still allow them to do so <br/>
if they decide.<br/>
