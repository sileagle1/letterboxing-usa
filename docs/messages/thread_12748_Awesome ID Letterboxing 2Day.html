                    <div class="plaintext-content">All right.  I worked with about 7 students and 3 teachers today in <br/>
Eagle on a crash course in Letterboxing.  After each person created a <br/>
personal signature stamp, we went out and found the Fish Lips <br/>
letterbox together in Eagle, Idaho.  All the teachers were so excited <br/>
and some of the students even want to try it on their own.  We'll see <br/>
how it goes from here.  I was so thrilled.  What fun.  They were all <br/>
so creative!  Fun fun fun.  So a great day to be letterboxing in <br/>
Idaho.<br/>
<br/>
PS I'll post all my clues to the new site this weekend.  Sorry I <br/>
haven't done it, but I've been on the road.  Thanks.  <br/>

<br/>
It turns out what I did was totally not planned. =-)  I had mentioned<br/>
to the teachers that's what I do and they were quite curious so the <br/>
next day I brought some of my supplies and a printoff of clues for <br/>
the closest LB.  I gave the students (actually 18-21 year old special <br/>
ed) a brief explanation of what letterboxing was.  From there each <br/>
student came up with a theme or idea for what they wanted their stamp <br/>
to look like.  Then one of the others teachers and I carved since I <br/>
only have 2 speedball carving tools.  The other teachers worked <br/>
diligently to make some logbooks for each student and then they <br/>
stamped each others books and stamped their own stamp on their <br/>
cover.  From there we all went out together to locate the letterbox.  <br/>
The students took turns reading each clue along the way.  It was very <br/>
basic and went really well.  Some of the students are more advanced <br/>
than others, but they all did awesome.  The main teacher wanted to <br/>
know why schools didn't do this more often...=-)  I can't believe we <br/>
got paid to go letterbox.  What a treat.  Anyhow, we're going again <br/>
Monday to try to hide one together as a class.  We sent information <br/>
sheets home and we'll see how it goes from there.  =-) I hope to come <br/>
up with a plan to have something more organized ready for the future <br/>
since I am in all different schools as a substitute teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I think the girl scouts will love whatever you come up.  =-)  Have <br/>
fun!  <br/>
