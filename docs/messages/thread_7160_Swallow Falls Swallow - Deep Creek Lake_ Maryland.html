PARK INFORMATION<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Swallow Falls State Park, located approximately 8 miles west of Marylands Deep Creek Lake, contains four beautiful waterfalls.  The Youghiogheny River flows along the park's borders, passing through shaded rocky gorges and creating rippling rapids. Muddy Creek Falls is a crashing 53-foot waterfall  a spectacular sight  and the tallest free-falling waterfall in Maryland. Tall hemlocks dominate the silent woods. The meandering trails through Swallow Falls guide hikers to some of the most breath-taking scenery in Western Maryland.  During the season, the park costs $2 per person; in the off-season, the park charges by the car.  Dont forget to bring your swimsuit and denim shorts to go rock sliding on Upper and Lower Swallow Falls.  During the heat of the summer, Lakeside Creamery sells delicious homemade ice cream near the Information Center for $2 per cone.<br/>
