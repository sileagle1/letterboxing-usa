                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks so much to Tim and the volunteers from the Postal Museum for <br/>
a very entertaining event.  <br/>
<br/>
We had several veterans in the crowd and lots of eager newbies to <br/>
be.  I spotted one recent convert exiting the building sporting a <br/>
maniacal grin.  I could almost read her brainwaves....<br/>
<br/>
how much leave do I have left at work?<br/>
do I own a decent pair of boots?<br/>
where can I buy a compass and some rubbermaid?<br/>
<br/>
Attendees were treated to 7 boxes hidden throughout the museum.  I <br/>
will admit that I particularly enjoyed skipping ahead of the rest of <br/>
the group with Firefly so we could leave the boxes in interesting <br/>
places (i.e. in plain sight) for the rest of our group in the rear. <br/>
<br/>
Several veterans got a little rambunctious when they discovered a <br/>
petrified letterboxer, obviously so overwhelmed by his first <br/>
find/hitchhiker/mystery box/cuckoo clue that he was instantly thrown <br/>
into a catatonic state.  <br/>
<br/>
A quick trip to the area where Firefly was attacked by squirrels to <br/>
nab one more box and then the ADG went off to Chinatown to enjoy <br/>
some handmade noodles and beef and steamed dumplings.  A quick trip <br/>
to the Chinese grocery, and a failed attempt on the Ram box led us <br/>
to the metro and home.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Mother Nature, the Letterboxing Gods, and the Smithsonian <br/>
for a lovely day!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Ram box in DC is tricky!  Keep looking where you sit, above you :-)  Its in a film canister and if placed correctly, it has a white bottom sticking out, but black sides (due to the black velcro).  When looked at, it doesn't look like a film canister.  It looks like a white knob in a black hole.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if the box is indeed there?  I would hate to hear that the box is missing!<br/>
