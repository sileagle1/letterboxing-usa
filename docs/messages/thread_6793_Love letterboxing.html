(I receive the digest), and there have been lots of interesting stuff <br/>
over the past few days.  It's too bad that some folks have been <br/>
insulted/hurt/offended by certain topics.<br/>
<br/>
The many recent news articles on Lb have increased the number of <br/>
folks who want to join the Lb ranks, and there are bound to be some <br/>
growing pains.  As a newbie, I will continue to focus on the positive <br/>
aspects of Lb, and I can weed out the rest as no-never-minds. It is <br/>
understandable that some of the veteran Lb'ers would feel upset at <br/>
some of the newer, odd ideas.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope that the kind webmasters and the Lb community will not stop <br/>
supporting this activity because of the complaints or rudeness of a <br/>
few.  Overall, feedback is a good thing.  My family and I hope to <br/>
enjoy letterboxing for many years to come.<br/>

As for lizardbutt's age, what does it matter, really?<br/>
