While I do understand the disappointment of looking for letterboxes one of<br/>
the things I think you need to keep in mind when searching for boxes is that<br/>
part of the fun is finding them, and if you were guaranteed to find every<br/>
box that you went looking for there would not be a lot of challenge or fun<br/>
in the hobby. I know that most letter boxers try very hard to keep their<br/>
clues up to date and let you know if they are aware a box is missing. If you<br/>
are finding that one person's boxes in particular are appearing to have not<br/>
been update you may want to try and contact that placer privately, off list,<br/>
and speak to them about it, or just avoid going on there boxes in the<br/>
future.  As you get more involved in the hobby I am sure that you will find<br/>
that there are some boxes you will have to look for several times before you<br/>
find them, some of them you might never find without a little help, not all<br/>
clues are forthright and revealing, some of them are real puzzles and<br/>
mysteries and that is part of the fun.  Another thing I might suggest is not<br/>
to look at not finding a box as a sad ending, instead look at it is at day<br/>
out of the house, with family and friends, where you got to see and<br/>
experience some things you might not have seen and experienced otherwise.<br/>
<br/>

Good luck in your finds<br/>

Very well put.  Last week I was trying to explain to a friend of mine about the lure of letterboxing.  She made some comment about, "But what if you waste all this time looking for the box and never find it?"  I tried to explain that looking for the box was only half the fun, that visiting new places I never knew existed or would have never thought to have visited made even a failed attempt worth-while.  Her reply was, "But how can you enjoy the new place if you're spending all day looking for the box..."<br/>
<br/>
*shrug*  That's why she's not a letterboxer ;)<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing! It's good to see<br/>
new interest in Atlanta. Pandora's right<br/>
about MOST people keeping their clues up<br/>
to date. I'm sure you just had a run of<br/>
bad luck. 2 out of 4 is definitely <br/>
unusual! We've got started on this hobby <br/>
over New Years, and have 34 successful <br/>
finds in Georgia. 2 boxes, we found out <br/>
later, were there but we missed them. <br/>
Another time, the box was gone but a <br/>
hitchhiker was there instead.<br/>
<br/>
On different days, Mark and I each tried<br/>
to find the Norcross box "Angel's Kiss",<br/>
and our emails to the placer went unanswered.<br/>
I think the she lost interest in the game.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a couple of times when we<br/>
knew that a box was reported missing but <br/>
not verified missing. One of those was<br/>
still there, and we were able to notify<br/>
the placer that the MIA report was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I include a "last verified" line in our<br/>
clues, and update it whenever we hear from<br/>
someone. We've always appreciated it when<br/>
we see that in other people's clues.<br/>
<br/>
Now, see? You've nearly guaranteed that<br/>
the chances of having more "failures" has<br/>
dropped to almost zero! You've got yours<br/>
out of the way early! Yippee!<br/>
<br/>
On a purely selfish note, Which park is <br/>
closed? I'd like to avoid that if possible.<br/>
(Or update my clues, if it's one of ours).<br/>
<br/>
Hope to meet you soon,<br/>

Thanks for the very nice and sympathetic note.  The park that is <br/>
closed for renovation is Providence Outdoor Rec Center in <br/>
Alpharetta.  The Big Boat and Treasure in My Back Yard boxes are <br/>
there (or they may be gone now with all the renovation.).  However, <br/>
the entrance to the park is blocked and there are no signs <br/>
indicating when the park will reopen.  I did notify the planters via <br/>
email, so maybe they'll update the clues on the website now.  Sorry <br/>
that Angel gave up.  I emailed her too, but I won't hold out for a <br/>
response since she didn't respond to you.<br/>
<br/>
The two we found successfully are Piedmont Park and Why Knot.  Both <br/>
fun experiences.<br/>
<br/>
My sister in Connecticut turned us on to letterboxing.  She says <br/>
there are hundreds in her area.  She's planting her first two boxes <br/>
very soon.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for the note.<br/>
<br/>
