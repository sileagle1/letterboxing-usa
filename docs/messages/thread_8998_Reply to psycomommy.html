That really makes me <br/>laugh. I take great pride in coming in last at some things. Like that <br/>stupid card game Bonco or whatever it's called. Losers get a nice <br/>prize too.<br/>   IMHO methinks you need to lighten-up and have some fun. Count, <br/>don't count. Believe it when I say enjoy everyday to it's fullest. <br/>Down the road you will be standing in line, counting your regrets, <br/>that you missed out on an opportunity that might have been fun. <br/>Heaven forbid! Fun, what a concept!<br/>   BTW I don't have an LbNA patch to show my accomplishments. I just <br/>open my mouth and say "How do you do?"  It's amazing all the <br/>wonderful people I've met just using what God gave me. <br/>   And on one last note I'm sick and tired of all this politically <br/>correctness BS.

Does it really matter if <br/>you <br/>&gt; have found 15 boxes or 1500? No, of course not. Some people aren't <br/>&gt; physically able to devote too much to the hobby, now-apparently a <br/>&gt; competive sport, yet enjoy it as much for the simple fact your off <br/>in <br/>&gt; the woods. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I admit I haven't found 100's of boxes. I only wear an LBNA numbers <br/>&gt; patch on my backpack on the off chance a person might see them and <br/>&gt; introduce themselves, not to establish some sort of hierarchy. I <br/>&gt; guess I'm just not an in-your-face kinda guy.
