new letterbox, "Osprey Letterbox" has been planted at<br/>
Mansfield Hollow State Park. It was placed 09/02/01 by<br/>
kayak. (But can also be reached by foot.)  Located in<br/>
the State of CT, Tolland County and in Mansfield<br/>
Center we are adding to the already generous allotment<br/>
of letterboxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Osprey Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
A letterbox at Mansfield Hollow State Park that can be<br/>
reached by kayak or by foot.  Inspired by a<br/>
breathtaking view in this part of the lake. Of an<br/>
adult osprey fishing seen from kayak. No Osprey<br/>
guaranteed on your visit, but Im willing to wager<br/>
that youll enjoy this special spot.<br/>
<br/>
By Kayak:<br/>
<br/>
Launch kayak or canoe at the Boat Launch area. Go<br/>
underneath Bassetts Bridge Road via the tubes to the<br/>
right of the boat launch area.   <br/>
Heat SE to the opposite shore.<br/>
Then travel southwards along far side of the lake<br/>
towards the dam.<br/>
Pass by an inlet on the left (good to explore later).<br/>
Maintain southerly direction, pass beneath<br/>
high-tension power lines.<br/>
Pass by a second inlet on the left (also good to<br/>
explore later).<br/>
Straight ahead youll see a knoll with majestic white<br/>
pines towering above a rocky shore.<br/>
Pull in kayaks here and climb to the top of the knoll.<br/>
At the Northernmost tip of the knoll is a large white<br/>
pine. <br/>
The prize is at the west side of the pine at its base.<br/>
You may then pursue  Lone Goose,  Kayaking<br/>
Letterbox or Cormorant<br/>
<br/>
By Foot:<br/>
<br/>
The trail you seek is the very one where Drew Clan has<br/>
planted Trout Fishing in America, followed by In<br/>
Watermelon Sugar After you have stamped in the pink<br/>
book hoist your packs because your walk has only just<br/>
begun. The Blue Blazed trail is very clearly marked,<br/>
but many unmarked trails and old logging/farm roads<br/>
traverse these beautiful open woods. So pay attention<br/>
at turns. This area is also used by hunters in season<br/>
 another reason to be careful.<br/>
The trail goes up. (While not a difficult trail it has<br/>
its ups and downs) and then passes to the right of a<br/>
red farmhouse and then a gray house. Continue, being<br/>
careful to stay on the trail. <br/>
Eventually the trail will jog left underneath the<br/>
power lines.<br/>
Some more ups and downs (or was it downs and ups?) <br/>
The trail will follow the edge of a cornfield on the<br/>
left and then turn right.<br/>
After some more downs and ups you will find yourself<br/>
climbing up the back of this beautiful knoll covered<br/>
with grass and scattered with large white pines. There<br/>
will be a three-sided view of the lake (location,<br/>
location, location),<br/>
At the Northernmost tip of this knoll is a large white<br/>
pine with a surprise hidden at the west side of its<br/>
base.<br/>
