The enclosed instructions advise that the finder should post where she is currently residing. This is so she can cruise around the country quickly with many folks adding their comments about their feelings on liberty and the aftermath of 911. I had received her back after 9-11-03, posted the comments to date then set her back to CT. After a few letterboxers had stamped in, she became stalled out some where when some one failed to post her location. Any CT. letterboxer want to solve the problem?<br/>
