the same.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of you, if you had read the clue, you'd have seen I <br/>
didn't actually include the clue because I forgot to include the <br/>
stamp with the letterbox when I hid it.  Instead, I wrote that if you <br/>
wanted the box, you'd have to contact me to get the stamp and hide it <br/>
with the box upon finding the box, and as an incentive you'd get an <br/>
easier clue than everyone else who will find it.<br/>
<br/>
At long last, the stamp has been replaced by Barry (thank you!), and <br/>
I've updated the clue with a REAL CLUE you can find the box with.  <br/>
But, as promised, it'll be a little more difficult than Barry had.  <br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
The URL for the box is <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Letterboxing/mcNeilPoint.html<br/>
<br/>
The URL hasn't changed, I just updated the webpage with the new clue.<br/>
