                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the encouragement. I started letterboxing in late July and got hooked! I will also pass on your words of praise to my daughter for the stamps. She is having a great time carving them. I always see your stamp where ever we go, and was pleased to know that you took the time to do my boxes, too. Maybe we will meet on the trail some time.<br/>
