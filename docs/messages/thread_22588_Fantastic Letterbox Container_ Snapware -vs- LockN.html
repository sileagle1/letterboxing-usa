<br/>
The "Snap 'N Lock" by SNAPWARE that I bought does look like the Lock N <br/>
Lock that some of you have mentioned. It looks like the Lock N Lock has <br/>
the side flaps that flare out a little bit and are more rounded... <br/>
other than that, I don't see a big difference. Both claim to be air and <br/>
water-tight.<br/>
<br/>
The one I mentioned was $2.49 where I purchased it (Kroger,) which is a <br/>
pretty reasonable price -- especially for boxers like me who don't <br/>
place many boxes each year(!) But I did find a link easily to these <br/>
boxes online right from the Snapware company. Just Google the word <br/>
SNAPWARE and you'll find all kinds of hits. You can buy the little <br/>
sizes individually direct from Snapware, without having to buy a whole <br/>
huge set... but it looks like the price is about double what I found it <br/>
for. I think it was $4.99.  Again, still not a bad price if you only do <br/>
this hobby occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm off to see if I can scarf up a few more of these at my <br/>
Kroger before they disappear!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>
