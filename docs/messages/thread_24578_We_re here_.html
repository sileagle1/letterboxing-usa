<br/>
The Moor Tor-ists are here in Dartmoor and what a great time we're<br/>
having. The group is as nuts as I thought it would be! <br/>
<br/>
After a 3 hour delay in Logan for our departure, things have gone<br/>
quite smoothly since. Today is Tuesday morning and we're getting ready<br/>
for breakfast. Our box count is up to 100 plus with today being spent<br/>
on the moor as well.<br/>
<br/>
We'll post more later. Hope all is well at home.<br/>
You HAVE to come here - it's just breath-taking!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get to Dartmoor!<br/>
<br/>
Mark &amp; Sue and The Moor Tor-ists<br/>
