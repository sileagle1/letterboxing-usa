and I was wondering about the practical aspects of hiding boxes on <br/>
Disney property. My gut feeling is that they're likely to "clean up" <br/>

<br/>
Soooo, I would greatly appreciate any advice folks can offer on these <br/>
two questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) Are there any tips or tricks to successfully hiding a box either at <br/>
the parks or at one of the hotels?<br/>
<br/>
2) Since we don't live in Orlando and are not among the lucky few who <br/>
can say they'll be back each year, I'm wondering if there's anyone out <br/>
there who would be willing to adopt the box, just to check on it every <br/>
now and then to make sure everything is ok, it still remains in place, <br/>
and that a new book is placed if necessary?<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail!<br/>

  They're so manicured, I bet a box wouldn't last 24 hours.   (And I'd also <br/>

that kind of company.)   Tom Sawyer Island (either California or Florida), as <br/>

<br/>
The boxes at the Wilderness Lodge and Caribbean Beach Resort have been there <br/>
quite awhile, though, so it must be possible to hide successfully in the <br/>
resorts.<br/>

You could put something in your clues about not being able to get back and <br/>

The easiest way to handle this is to get permission.  Contact the PR <br/>
department at Disney - check online at their website.  Find out who you would need to <br/>
talk to about and then fax them a letter and follow up with a phone call.  In <br/>
the letter, tell them that you'll be visiting the park, when and that you want <br/>
to plant a letterbox.  Include background on what letterboxing is, the <br/>
website, a rounded estimate of the number of letterboxes around the world and <br/>
thousands or people involved and what a great family hobby it is and educational, <br/>
boy scout trooops do it, etc, etc.  Point out that this will also bring more <br/>
visitors to their park.  Include a sample of letterbox clues for another box and <br/>
tell them that clues you write will lead people through thier park to find the <br/>
box.  Include an image of your stamp and a full description of the box and <br/>
all it's contents.  Describe what kinds of places you might look for to hide it <br/>
and ask for suggestions or what places they would approve.  <br/>
With the right communication and attendance to their concerns, you can get <br/>
permission to do anything.<br/>

While this is certainly the right way to go about it, I can see it <br/>
backfiring.   The Disney people go to the letterboxing site, see that there are boxes in <br/>
the Wilderness Lodge and Caribbean Beach Resort and are horrified.   "We must <br/>
get those intrusive boxes off our land!' they cry.   And then two boxes that <br/>
have been there for years, not hurting anyone, are gone.<br/>
<br/>
I could be totally misjudging Disney, but I really think they wouldn't be <br/>
receptive to anything on their property that they didn't put there themselves.<br/>

It can be done, but it's tough to find a practical location. I had <br/>
stayed at the Wilderness lodge years ago and knew they had some off <br/>
the track trails that I could hide a box. I never even concidered <br/>
hiding a box at any of the parks, they are too well maintained. The <br/>
resorts are your best bet, but it took me several trips to differant <br/>
ones before I felt I found a spot that would'nt be discovered or <br/>
attract undo attention. I hid all 3 of my Disney boxes a month after <br/>
9-11, so I wanted to make sure they were in a location that would'nt <br/>
concern anyone (ie; not in a public space).<br/>

Nice thought but it will NEVER happen! If you knew the stringent standards <br/>
the employees at Disney must go through for minimum wage, a handful of hours per <br/>
week AND they have to pay Union dues too, you'd know they'd are super rigid <br/>
on everything that goes on there. I'd be my letterboxing journal they's NEVER <br/>
allow a box on their property. Better to hide it, take your chances and tell <br/>
everyone who finds it to post the find on the website so we can see how long it <br/>
lasts. <br/>
<br/>
Someone placed 2 boxes at the CA Disneyland about a month ago. Anyone find <br/>
that one yet?<br/>

You would be absolutely correct.<br/>
<br/>
The whole idea behind Disney Theme Parks is absolute control of the environment that the guests experience and anything that takes away from the theme is forbidden.<br/>
<br/>
That is one of the reasons why they don't allow weddings to take place inside of any of their parks. It detracts from the 'show'. There have been cases of 'guerilla weddings' where the wedding party shows up at a spot in a park, has a quick 5 minute ceremony then disperses before Security finds out or has a chance to respond.  There are also stories where these weddings have failed because Security noticed the gathering of people who looked suspicous and broke it up before they could start the ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
The Disney Company is so into controlling the 'show' in the parks that there have been internal fights between the Entertainment Department and WDI (the part of the company that designs the parks) over entertainers that work in an area of the park and whether they are destroying the theme and mood of an area.<br/>
<br/>
In short, Disney Parks and Resorts will NOT be amenable to letterboxes on their property, at least any they know about... ;)<br/>

Now they have an official wedding service (through their disney<br/>

more wedding packages!  :-)  Now, that's Control with a capitalistic C :-)<br/>

&gt; Of course Disney lawyers might be looking at it as a liability....<br/>
&gt; <br/>

The first thing I think about in a place like Disneyland is if you are<br/>
caught you could be arrested for destruction of property because I would<br/>
think they would discourage this type of activity  because it could promote<br/>
a type of behavior that suggests  placing a bomb.   Would you not think<br/>
security is on the watch for certain behavior and if you are looking around<br/>
to avoid detection you may look suspicious.  Think about how that may<br/>
complicate security for all who go to the park.  I personally think we<br/>
should think of security first.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be an extra but at the same time you can hardly make it<br/>
through the park in one day let alone spend time hunting for a box unless<br/>
you go just for the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
If it is to be done I think it would be best to integrate it into the entire<br/>
theme and let Disney be in charge.<br/>
<br/>
Just my humble opinion .  <br/>

The only official wedding event allowed INSIDE the parks is the ride in the Wedding Carriage.  The ceremony still takes place outside of the park.<br/>

  Now they have an official wedding service (through their disney<br/>
  vacations)...maybe that's why they won't allow weddings...so they can sell<br/>
  more wedding packages!  :-)  Now, that's Control with a capitalistic C :-)<br/>
