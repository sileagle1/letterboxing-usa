you know a way!  Thanks!  Cap'n Rasha<br/>

<br/>
If you're looking to transfer the folders or even the individual<br/>
images within the system, that doesn't exist.  If you're changing a<br/>
group altogether--removing one group and launching a new one and you<br/>
want the same files--you can rename the old group with the new group's<br/>
name.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, the best that you can do is cut and paste, unless<br/>
there's some trick that I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.  <br/>
