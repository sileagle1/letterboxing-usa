Hi Ryan!  We wanted to let you know that the Pokemon stamps arrived safe and <br/>
sound and in time for the very first snow of the winter.  Although they were <br/>
not allowed to go out sledding with the little BeMas (one mitten is already <br/>
a MIA) they did get to sit at the table for hot cocoa!<br/>
<br/>
Identity update:  The Pokemon we thought might be Goldbat is actually <br/>
Nidoran male (there is a female one too).  It is a pink (don't ask why -- at <br/>
least they're not sexist) poison needle Pokemon.  It can be nice or mean <br/>
depending on who the trainer is (a lot like Pit Bulls....)  The cat is <br/>
Meowth.  The turtle is Squirtle.  The sea horse is Horsea and the purple <br/>
thing is Tangela.<br/>
<br/>
The imprints of the other stamps were pretty cool!  You definitely surpass <br/>
us in carving!!!  We are sorry that you are on the other coast so we won't <br/>
be able to search for your boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Once the snow melts, we'll start doing some research for a good park.  We <br/>
have actually pulled some site plans off the internet (Fairfax County Park <br/>
Authority has a great website with maps).  But the actual walk throughs will <br/>
have to wait.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!  Team BeMa is psyched and we will try and do the stamps proud!<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  You should try and come over to Northern Virginia/DC.  We've got the <br/>
Nation's Capital, the Smithsonian (not to be put in the subject line), lots <br/>
of great restaurants featuring cuisine from EVERYWHERE and a ton of great <br/>
boxes to find!  (And if you do find Froggy -- let us know!)<br/>
<br/>
