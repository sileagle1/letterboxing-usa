                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey! Hey! Hey!! We may be a small and extremely expensive state to <br/>
live in, but lots of open space has been preserved. We letterboxers <br/>
realize the importance of getting something (that costs nothing--i.e. <br/>
letterboxes and resultant friendships, but is wortha million)for our <br/>
high taxes and the high cost of living in the "Nutmeg State".<br/>
 Regarding dangerous creatures: don't be dissin' us.  We have native <br/>
born timber rattlers (a protected species here in CT).  We have <br/>
copperheads.  We have brown recluse spiders!! And, ummm...black <br/>
bears, coyotes, foxes, fishers, wild turkeys,Moose!! (once in a <br/>
while).<br/>
 But seriously folks,  our wealth of boxes is due to the myriad of <br/>
ardent letterboxing souls whoe dedicate a huge amount of time to <br/>
planting boxes, often series, for the rest of us to find.  <br/>
 Cat lover/teacher/gardener  (P. 1 in CT., had 1 placed by Irish <br/>
Tinker as part of series in CT. , P. 1 in Mass. and am placing <br/>
another in Mass this weekend.)<br/>
  In my efforts to emulate Johney Appleseed, I will place a letterbox <br/>
in R.I. in Dec. and hope to plant a l.b. in  N.H. before to long. <br/>
