already-nervous cops the wrong impression.<br/>
<br/>
Don't know if there are already boxes in these places, but here's where <br/>
I'd put them:<br/>
* Einstein statue<br/>
* between the Vietnam Memorial and the soldiers<br/>
* Jefferson Memorial riverwalk (Cherry Blossom area)<br/>
* George Mason statue/gardens around it<br/>
* IN the ice cream store across from the Old Exec. - assuming they'd <br/>
give permission. Very convenient spot to stop for a snack.<br/>
* by the little gold building (or was that a statue?  can't remember)<br/>
* by the stone building (pump/lock house?) across from/near the gold <br/>
building<br/>
* around the Reflecting Pool, near the end where you can see the <br/>
reflections of the Monument<br/>
* near the Carousel<br/>
* in the Castle garden somewhere<br/>
* in/near the East-West Wing fountain/skylight<br/>
* in the Air &amp; Space Museum (with permission - don't want them freaking <br/>
- like maybe under a particular chair or behind a column in the <br/>
planetarium or theatre; Star Trek exhibit; rockets)<br/>
* in/outside the Arboretum (or is that the Botanical Gardens?  The one <br/>
with tons of parking right in front of it and the lit-up giant trees <br/>
inside and the orchid garden.  Orchid garden has lots of hiding places.)<br/>
