&gt; trips to places in OH, VA, MD, PA, NJ, IN, KY, NH, VT, MA, and RI, <br/>
&gt; with just a few of those super CT series tacked on at the end! My <br/>
&gt; 3000th box was the CT mystery "Healing Staff", which I thought was <br/>
&gt; really cool, since we could probably all use healing from some of <br/>
&gt; life's wounds! Letterboxing at its best can help provide some of <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; kind, uplifting spirit, so thanks again to everyone who helps to <br/>
keep <br/>
&gt; it alive!<br/>

<br/>
Congratulations Wanda! At this point, can anyone beat you? Hahaha...<br/>
