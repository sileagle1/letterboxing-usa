                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am sitting here this morning yet again shaking my head and what I <br/>
see going on here on the LBNA talk list.  But most of all I am <br/>
dumbfounded and find myself in a bit of a conundrum.  As a moderator <br/>
on this list I would like nothing more than to try and help all of <br/>
the members have a pleasant experience here on the talk list. I <br/>
don't comprehend the desire of some people to be jerks to be mean <br/>
and to slam down others or anything of the like.  <br/>
<br/>
But instead of sitting here telling you that you are all wrong or <br/>
agreeing with the ones I thought were right, I thought I would just <br/>
give a first hand example of how this sort of thing effects people <br/>
in everyday life.  Because you see my fellow letter boxers, I <br/>
believe that part of the problem is that it is so easy to do or say <br/>
something in this medium without giving thought and consideration to <br/>
who reads it or how it makes them feel or how they respond to it, <br/>
because the truth of the matter is that you are highly unlikely to <br/>
ever have to face them.<br/>
<br/>
I thought perhaps, just for a moment if someone saw what this sort <br/>
of thing does to the people involved they might think twice before <br/>
hitting the send button.<br/>
<br/>
Iron`Bear and I are personal friends of Team Rayvenhaus; actually we <br/>
are such good friends that we consider each other family.  I don't <br/>
know about the rest of you, but friendships like that are important <br/>
to me, they are rare to come by this day in age. When I introduced <br/>
Steve and Kris to letterboxing it was with a vast desire to share a <br/>
hobby that I absolutely love with two people that are very special <br/>
in my life. <br/>
<br/>
Since doing that I have to say that I am nothing but sorry that I <br/>
did so. I'm sorry to Steve and Kris that I introduced them to <br/>
something that would cause so much venom and hostility in their <br/>
lives.  In less than a year of being involved in letterboxing, they <br/>
have had to deal with people hating them for their "enthusiasm", a <br/>
mirage of hate mail because they accidentally used the name "Freight <br/>
Fest" without realizing the repercussions, people boycotting events <br/>
because they might simply be there.  The saddest part is, I went to <br/>
Steve at one point and asked him to kick back, to let things lay and <br/>
let the dust settle so to speak.  But the reality is that this list <br/>
won't even allow my friend to do that. Instead its as if the "Anti-<br/>
Steve" party wants to sit there and nit pick at every word that <br/>
comes out of his mouth in and effort to find something wrong with it.<br/>
<br/>
What Brian said is right; everyone that lives in this wonderful <br/>
country of ours has freedom to do what they wish in their pursuit of <br/>
happiness. If you want to be known as a jerk, and be mean and nasty <br/>
to people, then you go right ahead.  But I think you should realize <br/>
how your posts affect people. Let's forget for a moment Team <br/>
Rayvenhaus  let's talk about their kids. Their innocent children <br/>
who have done nothing to you, I know for a fact that the Rayvenkids <br/>
have asked their parents on more than one occasion why everyone <br/>
hates them, they don't understand, and what did they do so wrong? <br/>
They didn't do anything, their Dad stepped on a few toes and now the <br/>
whole family pays a price, but why did the toes get stepped on in <br/>
the first place? Because some people didn't like their enthusiasm, <br/>
they didn't like Steve's sense of humor, is promoting his website. I <br/>
can't even tell you how many times someone has said to me "Gee <br/>
thanks pandora for introducing Team Rayvenhaus to this hobby."  Or <br/>
how many people tell me that they curse me for doing so. It's <br/>
absolutely ridiculous, and downright hurtful, to me, to them, to <br/>
Iron`Bear and to their children.<br/>
<br/>
What gets me is that letterboxing is something so beautiful, so <br/>
natural, so family oriented, and yet, here on this talk list, it <br/>
becomes a nasty free for all of constant bickering and putting <br/>
people down.<br/>
<br/>
When I signed on as a moderator it was because I wanted to help put <br/>
a stop to some of this nonsense. I wanted to help make this talk <br/>
list a better place. And to those of you who have stood up and <br/>
voiced you're opinion about how hurtful and venomous this list gets; <br/>
I extend my personal apology that I have been unsuccessful in doing <br/>
so.  I wish there was more I could do, however the common consensus <br/>
on how this talk list should be ran is to let everyone do and say <br/>
what they want and just keep the porn and spam out, so that is what <br/>
I do now.<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten several emails from members of the list asking me why I <br/>
don't get the moderators to do something about all of the tension <br/>
and negativity, the truth is, that isn't what the moderators are <br/>
there for, nor do they want to be. They don't want to be referring <br/>
the childish fights going on in the sandbox of letterboxing. What I <br/>
would suggest to all of you that are tired of the way the list is <br/>
going, that cannot take the negativity and slapping and biting any <br/>
longer is to write to the moderators yourself, privately and let <br/>
them know how you feel and request that the modicum and demeanor of <br/>
the list be change by instituting stricter moderation and rules.  <br/>
You can reach the moderators and list owner at letterbox-usa-owner <br/>
at yahoogroups.com. For those of you that don't like that suggest, I <br/>
suggest you too email the moderators with your preferences for list <br/>
management, no need to start flaming and attacking me for it <br/>
publicly where everyone else gets to see you be mean and nasty, just <br/>
address it to me privately at hispandora at phlsystems.com and you <br/>
can be as mean and nasty as you want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Again I extend my heartfelt apology to those that would like a <br/>
kinder, gentler list. I wish I could have done more to try and help <br/>
reach that goal.<br/>

Your intentions are noble, but it's not fun being a moderator.  You <br/>
can't make everyone happy.  You've got to make decisions that you <br/>
really don't want to.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people on this list don't realize how much work moderating <br/>
a large talk list can be, nor the stress involved.  Many times, you <br/>
end up in a lose-lose situation.  Just be strong and know that <br/>
you're doing your best.  And hope others realize that as well.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, being a moderator should not feel like a prison <br/>
sentence.  There will always be someone who'll be happy to take up <br/>
the moderator reigns.  I don't want you feeling that you 'have' to <br/>
continue moderating the group until the end of time.  Sometimes, <br/>
it's great to be a peon such as myself and not have the <br/>
responsibility of keeping the board running smoothly.  (Or even, <br/>
playing devil's advocate and making it run not so smoothly.  *wink*)<br/>

PS. Just so everyone knows, I'm not trying to convince Pandora to <br/>
abdicate control over the talk list so I can assume the position.  <br/>
I'm extraordinarily lazy, and I don't want ANY part of moderating a <br/>
list this large or heated!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the post and the support and vote of confidence. You're <br/>
always pretty nice to me, even if zillions of other people dislike <br/>
you <wink> but I will never pass up an opportunity to give you some <br/>
grief and fun poking and roasting =) I just find it so fun to pick <br/>
on you!<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, thank you for the words and the concern, I appreciate <br/>
it. You right it should not feel like a prison sentence to be a <br/>
moderator. I'm just not through trying to reach my goal of a <br/>
peaceful list quite yet.<br/>
