Compass Rose LB in Norwich, CT last evening.  He brought me back this <br/>
morning(Iwas working yesterday) and we stamped in.  Hurray!!!  It was <br/>
in great shape, but hasn't seen too many visitors.  We've been <br/>
working on this box since we started letterboxing last year.  So for <br/>
those in doubt, it is indeed still there, it just takes a lot of <br/>
persistence!<br/>
