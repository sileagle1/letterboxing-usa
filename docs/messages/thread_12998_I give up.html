Well, Memlili, maybe a few of us can come visit you, not for a <br/>
gathering, but for an exchange session....(nevermind you &amp; I have <br/>
already exchanged, I'm happy to do it again).<br/>
<br/>
I need to come up that way anyway, to visit the aunts &amp; uncles.<br/>

Please don't take the comments personally.  There have been many others that<br/>
have written lately on NPS issues.  I agree with the thought that we should<br/>
respect laws for planting with NPS land w/o permission (although I am<br/>
sorely, sorely tempted on a weekly basis being a stone's throw from<br/>
Yellowstone and The Grand Teton NP).<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the post was not only in response to your suggestion.  I too<br/>
have recently posted on NPS boxes.  I'm one of the ones that responded to<br/>
the Ochre Rock question that has gone around.  I also suggested getting<br/>
together for an exchange.  I wasn't suggesting planting more (except for the<br/>
many areas just outside of Yellowstone that are equally fun and legal), but<br/>
since I heard a question and had seen what I then thought was the answer<br/>
(but since have heard it was the "imaginary" turtle answer :) in a variety<br/>
of spots by prominent letterboxers,  I assumed it was public knowledge and<br/>
passed a link on to the list.  I apologize for that if it offended anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted you to know that the comments were probably based in a<br/>
large variety of chatter that has gone on lately regarding NPS boxing, not<br/>
just yours, and if there are LBers who are being threatened with<br/>
prosecution, then it is certainly good for us to be reminded of the possible<br/>
consequences should someone choose to ignore a law.  There have been many<br/>
much more specific posts than yours as of late.  Don't let one letter that<br/>
was written with a good intent ruin your legal fun!  Absolutely have the<br/>
gathering.  If I hadn't used up all my vacation time for a major trip I'm<br/>
taking next month, I'd be looking at coming out myself.<br/>
<br/>
And on another note . . . can we all take a deep breath and read the posts<br/>
with the understanding that we working with a LARGE community from a wide<br/>
variety of backgrounds.  It seems lately that several have been hurt or<br/>
offended by comments that weren't meant as such.  It is hard to sometimes<br/>
communicate feelings in print and some comments are sometimes interpreted as<br/>
being stronger or more personal than they may be.  I know we all enjoy the<br/>
connection to each other and the experiences that LBing has brought us.<br/>
That shouldn't change, take things with a grain of salt-if it applies,<br/>
great!-If not, get clarification or shrug it off.  Just a thought-hope it<br/>
isn't offensive.  I promise it was not at all intended as such.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the time!<br/>

If you can have this somewhat later in the summer or early fall, that would be really good as it gives us time to work it out.  I have a long holiday weekend in the middle of August.  There are places to camp there, yes?  I knew someone from DC who says he camped up there every year.  If you decide to have this, Memlili (and I hope you do whether we can attend or not), please let us have some links to some recommended camping areas nearby.  Or even an inexpensive motel...  I really do like amenities. :-)<br/>
