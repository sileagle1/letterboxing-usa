Travelling Man Hitchhiker will soon be on the road headed west.  But <br/>
its journey so far seems worth recounting.  <br/>
Apparently, it was initially left ca. December 2002 at Gwendolyn's My <br/>
Home Gnome LB by (I'm told) Bill of Washington state and taken from <br/>
there by Adventure Seekers of Dupont, WA on Northwest Airlines Flt. 7 <br/>
to Tokyo !  Promptly returned to the U.S. on 12/12 by Amanda from <br/>
Seattle, it was then left on 12/17 at her One-Armed Bandit LB (now <br/>
retired) in Las Vegas.  On 12/31 Holly aka ZenRoxie left him at <br/>
Utah's Dixie LB in St. George, from whence on 1/9/03 it went on to <br/>
Kwagunogwas LB in Logan, UT (that's Shoshonie-speak for the Logan <br/>
["Crane"] River, with which I became acquainted during a sabbatical <br/>
at Utah State in 1972). Ten weeks of winter later Jill aka Moosegirl <br/>
left him at the Wapiti LB in Jackson (WY)?, where after another ten <br/>
weeks Rich took him east to be left at the Old Man of the Mountain LB <br/>
in NH on 6/20.  <br/>
A month later the Arnolds &amp; Levitres transfered him to the Lafayette <br/>
Campground, and from there he went on to CT with Chuck &amp; Janine <br/>
Killingly who left him with the NeeDeeps.  They took him to Quaddick <br/>
State Forest from whence Wanda from RI took him back westward to the <br/>
new HH Hostel near Cortland, NY.  That's where JeLybean found him on <br/>
8/31 before leaving him at the rather obscure Finger Lakes LB on 9/8, <br/>
where he might well have spent a long cold winter.<br/>
<br/>
Now Arkansas may get a little of the action. <br/>
<br/>
(Hope I got all this straight; it's not all that easy accurately to <br/>
reconstruct the saga from the log)<br/>
