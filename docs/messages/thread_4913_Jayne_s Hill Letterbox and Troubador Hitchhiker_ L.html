missing.  The hill is a popular spot and one prone to vandalism.  <br/>
This is the second note I've received reporting it missing, so I <br/>
guess it's time to declare it gone!<br/>
<br/>
Last time I checked on Jayne's Hill about a year ago, it was in place <br/>
and I was puzzled to find several odd items in the box....a cigarette <br/>
and some mints.  I later found out that there is also a geocache on <br/>
the hill and assumed someone had gotten the letterbox and cache <br/>
confused.<br/>
<br/>
Jayne's Hill was originally placed in January, 2001 along with The <br/>
Troubadour Hitchhiker.  When I checked on the box last June it was <br/>
still there and the HH was gone.  There was no mention of the HH in <br/>
the log by any of the letterboxers who'd stamped in.  Does anyone <br/>
have any information on finding or placing The Troubadour HH?  <br/>
