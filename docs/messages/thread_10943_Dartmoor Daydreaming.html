Work is simply not as fun as vacation.  Especially when you consider <br/>
the vacation I just got back from.  On Valentine's Day I flew from JFK <br/>
to the UK and spent five fantastic days letterboxing in Dartmoor ... <br/>
and then three days in London.  What a trip!!<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday evening, members of the Dartmoor Letterbox Club met me at <br/>
The Plume of Feathers pub for drinks, clues, and lots of fun stories.  <br/>
On Sunday I went out to Cranmere Pool (the letterbox that started it <br/>
all) with The Furzgood's and Tailchaser.  I'm glad they came with me.  <br/>
Letterboxes on the moor are totally different than I expected.  On <br/>
Monday and Tuesday, Alan took me out and showed me many beautiful areas <br/>
of Dartmoor.  It didn't hurt that we found 36 boxes in one day!<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday ... Wednesday ... Wednesday ... what a great day!  Dartmoor <br/>
Chris took me to so many places.  I must have taken 150 pictures in one <br/>
day!  By 5:30 we had found so many letterboxes that I had a total of <br/>
over 100 finds!!!!!!  We headed over to the The Dolphin Hotel in Bovey <br/>
Tracey for the letterboxing meeting which happens every Wednesday <br/>
evening.  While I was there I met many friendly letterboxers.  The two <br/>
woman who are photographed in the Smithsonian article were there as <br/>
well as 'God' who has over 50,000 finds (that is not a misprint!).  <br/>
That night I became the first American to join the Dartmoor 100 club!<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, I was allowed to go out on the moor alone!  :)  I ran out to <br/>
Nun's Cross and Fox Tor and found about 15 boxes.  In total I took over <br/>
400 pictures and every one is of a great memory of the best vacation I <br/>
have ever taken!  <br/>
<br/>
Keep an eye out for some new letterboxes to be released once the snow <br/>
has melted.  I hope to plant a series called Dartmoor Daydreams ... <br/>
which will all have clues and be sited like boxes out on the moor.  In <br/>
the meantime, check out my web page.  I will be posting new pictures <br/>
from my trip each week.  They were very high quality prints so it may <br/>
take a little while to download.  I hope you all had a great vacation <br/>
too!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">---   Greetings Alan, <br/>
      Heard you were in Dartmoor, so I checked out the Dartmoor <br/>
Letterbox Club site. You looked like you had gone to Letterbox <br/>
heaven. And you looked quite cold! From all the pictures I've seen of <br/>
Dartmoor where do they hide their boxes? Everything looks so open. Do <br/>
you carry a spade and bury them?  Then post; take 150 paces from some <br/>
point and look for the area that is the shape of Africa. Just <br/>
Curious! <br/>
     Considering the price to fill my car every other day, it would <br/>
be cheaper to take a flight over on a Friday night, nab a couple of <br/>
hundred boxes, get some exchanges at the closest pub, and be back in <br/>
time for dinner on Sunday. <br/>
     So happy you had a memorable trip. Looking forward to more pics.<br/>
    Psychomommy<br/>
