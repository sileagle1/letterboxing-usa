<div>I hope someone can help me. i was exploring the 
lbna web site and links and came across a message about letterboxes in bolton, 
mass. i bookmarked it, but in the interim my son crashed our computer, which 
required reloading everything and a trip to the computer store for a new 
internet card. now, i can't find the site and we are planning a visit to my 
sister in bolton in two weeks. i wanted to introduce her to the fun we've been 
having all summer. can anyone point me in the right direction - or was i just 
imagining it? many thanks</div>

    The Bolton letterbox stuff was part of a website for Bolton, MA and<br/>
I think you can find it through a search on yahoo.com.  I seem to<br/>
remember it was part of a community newspaper so maybe your sister can<br/>
ask at the Town Hall?<br/>

The Bolton link has been on the faq for a while at<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq.html#016<br/>
<br/>
I try to keep links to all known NA letterboxing sites there.<br/>
I'm sure many of us know about all these sites, but if you're looking<br/>
you can check there, and if you know of the many that aren't there,<br/>
drop me or the list a note.  Also, many are redundant to sites whose<br/>

Thanks, Kate! You know, there's a typo in one of the compass bearings <br/>
in the Sound View series that we haven't gotten out to fix: maybe <br/>
that is what sent you in the wrong direction. Sorry! If you email us <br/>
direct (drewclan @ aol.com) we'll give you the right clues.<br/>
