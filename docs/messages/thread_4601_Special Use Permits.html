                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow - I've never had that kind of treatment from federal land managers, even<br/>
when I was placing swarm traps for africanized ("killer") bees ......- except<br/>
for that one guy at Cabeza Prieta NWR who had to inspect my tires before I could<br/>
drive on his roads.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; True enough, but my general experience is that the Audubon folks are Nazis.<br/>
&gt; I do a lot of trail running and God help me if they see me "jogging" on one<br/>
&gt; of their trails. They politely point out the signs prohibiting such abuse of<br/>
&gt; the land, and then ask for my receipt to prove I paid to use the trails.<br/>
&gt; Yeah, when my car is eleven miles away!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let's hope the MA gathering mystery box is safe...<br/>
