be converted to jpg and sent to me? I know this breaks protocol, but <br/>
we're hoping to launch a search and rescue. I'm hoping to carve and <br/>
replace the stamp there, since it seems to have gone to pieces.<br/>

Canaveral Marshes Letterbox<br/>
Adopted by: DrewFamily<br/>
State: Florida<br/>
County: Orange <br/>
Nearest city: Orlando<br/>
Update March 2004: The stamp is badly in need of repair. it is broken <br/>
into several pieces and the material seems to be damaged from being <br/>
waterlogged. Nice image anyway! The tupperware is slightly cracked <br/>
which I think may be why it is so damp.<br/>

We'll be in the Orlando area next week. Is there anything we can do <br/>
to help maintain this box? We'd even be willing to carve a <br/>
replacement stamp if you think it's necessary (would need a jpg of <br/>
the image, tho.)<br/>
<br/>
We regularly bring a repair kit containing a "fresh" box, baggies, <br/>
pens, and paper wherever we go letterboxing anyway. It wouldn't be <br/>
much trouble for us.<br/>
<br/>
Write soon; we leave Saturday morning.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx,<br/>

Awesome! I'm sorry to say that I don't have any idea how those boxes <br/>
are doing. We just adopted the clues when the site changed over last <br/>
year because the planter, Dr. Mings, was such a great guy way back <br/>
when in the early days. Let me know what you decide! J in CT<br/>
