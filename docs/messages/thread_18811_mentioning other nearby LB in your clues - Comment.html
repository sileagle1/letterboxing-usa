                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Often when reviewing clues I see the mention of other letterboxes <br/>
in the general vicinity.  For example, "Don't forget to bring the <br/>
clues for ..." or "same starting point as...".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do placers ask permission before including the names of other <br/>
boxes?  And if not, do placers of the mentioned letterboxes seem to <br/>
mind when they find out?<br/>

I do not ask permission, but I only reference other nearby<br/>
boxes if their clues are non-secretive and it is obvious<br/>
that their box resides in the same area.  Maybe it is a bad<br/>
assumption on my part, but I feel they would want the extra<br/>
publicity.  The down-side to this is if a park reads my clues<br/>
and confiscates my box, they can find out other boxes reside <br/>
in the park.  However, they probably would find them anyway.<br/>
I personally don't mind others referencing my boxes with or<br/>
without my permission, as long as my clues are non-secretive.<br/>
How do others feel about this?<br/>

I know when we placed one of our boxes we used a reference to another<br/>
box because they were in the same park.  But, both boxes (mine &amp; theirs)<br/>
told others the name of the park - it was not a secretive kind of clue.<br/>
Of course, if this person objected, I would be more than happy to remove<br/>
that part of my directions.<br/>
