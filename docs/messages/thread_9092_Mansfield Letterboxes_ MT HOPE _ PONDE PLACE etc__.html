ask for nicer weather.  <br/>
Friday (no school) took the kids to the new MT HOPE PARK in Mansfield-<br/>
-What a great place--The kids had a blast running about in the fields <br/>
and playing on the dock! Jake took a swim in the smelly swamp!! PEW<br/>
He just doesn't care!!  Thanks for another great Letterbox series <br/>
Leader of the pack--found all 4, all in good condition--loved the <br/>
story!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday--Little Princess, Jake and I checked out Ponde Place <br/>
Letterbox--guess we just missed Lenny and Kathy (NEEDEEPS)!! <br/>
It's a beautiful little spot--lots of geese on the water! The box is <br/>
in good shape--thanks for the compass practice Chuck! <br/>
We also were the first to find "Music to my ears" LB at Annie Vinton <br/>
School--Nice Job B!   <br/>
