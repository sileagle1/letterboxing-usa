I think it's in Massachusetts myself, but what kind of question is<br/>
"does it border NY"? =) Why not ask, "Is it in CT or MA?" Of the<br/>
three, I think RI was the least likely for the box to be in and kind<br/>

Don't blame the people asking the questions.<br/>
Remember... who picks the one question a day to be answered? The person <br/>
who planted the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure people asked "Is it Conn?" or "Is it Mass?" But this is a <br/>
game, and ephemeralletterboxer holds all the cards and can play them at <br/>

<br/>
Actually, today's question and answer eliminated Rhode Island from the<br/>
running since it doesn't border New York. Definitely not Rhode Island.<br/>
<br/>
No offense was intended for Rhode Island--I'm sure it's a pretty place<br/>
and all. But the people I suspect of such a creative, wickedly clever<br/>
game don't live in Rhode Island, and I think the instigator planted it<br/>
close enough where he or she could check up on it fairly easily. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
If I had to guess, I'd lean more toward Massachusetts than<br/>
Connecticut. But what do I know. I was suspecting Maine or New York<br/>
might be likely locations for the box, and both of those were wrong. =)<br/>

If the answer is yes, then split those in half. If the answer is no, then we <br/>

I was told "Previously submitted questions will be ignored."  So if <br/>
you submit a Q-7 and it doesn't get selected, you'll need to resubmit <br/>
as Q-8 (IF you think it is still relevant.)<br/>
<br/>
But your approach -- which is the 'halving method' works for <br/>
computers - and to some extent should work for 20 questions.<br/>
<br/>
So at this time we don't know if it is CT or MA, do we?<br/>

Thanks — but actually I wasn't asking permission. I was trying to get a <br/>
discussion going or get us thinking as one entity so we aren't asking throw-away <br/>
questions. Since that first email I thought perhaps another (possibly better) <br/>
way to ask the next question would be: Is this box hidden in a county that <br/>
begins with letters A through M. We don't have to worry about the states because <br/>
eventually we will weed it down to just a few counties. Just another thought <br/>
before the next question is asked.<br/>

&gt; that begins with letters A through M.<br/>
<br/>
You'll want to double check that all county names don't start between<br/>
A through M, for instance, in which case such a question is absolutely<br/>
useless. Better off listing all counties in alphabetical order,<br/>
finding the halfway point, and asking if the county comes after it in<br/>
an alphabetically listing.<br/>
<br/>
As the questions are progressing now, I think locals definitely have<br/>
an advantage with their geographical knowledge. Even my suggestion for<br/>
breaking down the counties may not be very good if a few, select<br/>
counties make up a particularly large piece of the landmass.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not very familiar with the county geography of Massachusetts and<br/>
Connecticut, however, and am unqualified to make such a decision. =)<br/>
<br/>
For now, I'd still like to know if the box is in Massachusetts or<br/>
Connecticut. Seems like a logical, simple, question rather than the<br/>
more strange ones people have been asking. =) Does Mark let on more<br/>
than he knows? He seems to be pretty sure it's in Connecticut--or is<br/>
that just wishful thinking? =)<br/>
<br/>
Of for previous question being ON the Appalachian Trail--while I agree<br/>
it's not a particularly useful question unless you get extraordinarily<br/>
lucky and it is actually located on the trail (but then you're still<br/>
left with the question "is it in Connecticut or Massachusetts?").<br/>
However, I would like to protest the claim that the term ON should be<br/>
used so literally. In the fuzzy little language we like to call<br/>
English, it's not uncommon for the word to actually mean 'along',<br/>
'near', 'by', etc. In this question, the context clearly means the<br/>
person is asking if the box requires hiking on the Appalachian Trail<br/>
because the box is alongside of it somewhere, and that's the question<br/>
that should have been answered--the one that the person actually asked<br/>
rather than the overly literal interpretation of it.<br/>
<br/>
But that's just my opinion. =)<br/>

<br/>
  &gt; Don't underestimate little Rhode Island. We have beautiful parks<br/>
  &gt; here. I think it is in RI. I will keep watching the clues unfold.<br/>
<br/>
  Actually, today's question and answer eliminated Rhode Island from the<br/>
  running since it doesn't border New York. Definitely not Rhode Island.<br/>
<br/>
  No offense was intended for Rhode Island--I'm sure it's a pretty place<br/>
  and all. But the people I suspect of such a creative, wickedly clever<br/>
  game don't live in Rhode Island, and I think the instigator planted it<br/>
  close enough where he or she could check up on it fairly easily. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
  If I had to guess, I'd lean more toward Massachusetts than<br/>
  Connecticut. But what do I know. I was suspecting Maine or New York<br/>
  might be likely locations for the box, and both of those were wrong. =)<br/>

That's kind of offensive, you know. It has nothing to do with having<br/>
children or not, but rather I prefer to see the question that was<br/>
actually asked get answered rather than the question that wasn't asked<br/>
being answered. If he couldn't answer the question that was asked<br/>
because it was asked improperly, it should have been discarded.<br/>
<br/>
You think I've never played 20 questions with children before? You<br/>
think I actually limit them to 20 questions? ;o)<br/>
