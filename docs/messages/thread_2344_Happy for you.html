Glad you found the boxes and enjoyed the park.  I also enjoy going to new places and checking out the sceanery.  I too am hoping that more boxes spring up in this area like the New England states.  What a great way to get out and enjoy nature.  My friends and I call it "hiking<br/>
with purpose".  Did you do the Covered Bridge box in Tyler also?  Happy boxing!<br/>

&gt; Pam and I went out this weekend at found the Tyler SP letterboxes.  What a lovely park!  We are not natives of the northeast and letterboxing seems to be a way that people share their favorite spots.  Half the fun is going someplace that we never would have thought of going.<br/>
&gt; Boxes are starting to pop up in PA and NJ at a faster rate than we can find them so it seems that letterboxing has finally arrived here (it has been in CT for a while).  Again thanks for placing the boxes in Tyler--it was a lot of fun hunting them.<br/>
