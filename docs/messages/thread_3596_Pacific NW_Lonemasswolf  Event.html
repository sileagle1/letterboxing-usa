<br/>
It looks like we've got people willing and ready for an impromptu-type<br/>
deal to meet up with Lonemasswolf on Sunday evening on the West Side!  <br/>
<br/>
It will take place at 5:00pm Sunday in the Beaverton area.  Probably at<br/>
the Izzy's on TV Hwy(?)  Is that where it's at, Mitch and Thom?  Will<br/>
you be there?  How about Cara?  I'd love to meet her, too!  Mark and<br/>
Beth?  Anyone and everyone!  <br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you're coming, so I can get a decent headcount and<br/>
I'll see if we can get a room or something.  For anyone who doesn't<br/>
know, Izzy's is a pizza/buffet type place. It's about $8 for dinner, I<br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
That's the tentative plan for now.  Concrete details to come soon!  I'll<br/>
carve up an event stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Fred, with that many boxes found, you better have lots of stamps to <br/>
show off!  It's not often many of us out in Portland get to see so <br/>
many stamps from other places!  =)<br/>

Beth and I talked and will try to be there, if her cold gives her a <br/>
break and is really on its way out.<br/>
<br/>
For the likes of me though, I can't figure out why Lonemasswolf would <br/>
pass up hunting for the Terrestrial Gastropod Letterboxes, if he's on <br/>
the west side.  Not that I'm particularily partial to this series or <br/>
anything.  ;o)<br/>
