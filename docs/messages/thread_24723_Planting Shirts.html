Subject: [LbNA] Re: Planting Shirts<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is wrong with a human being like you? Honestly. Is this how you <br/>
are at home and at work? Imagine if you had lunch everyday with <br/>
someone and you dissected everthing someone said. How many friends <br/>
would you have?<br/>
<br/>
Not only did I print 100 shirts already (in December, actually), but <br/>
I designed a few more, and a friend of mine designed others, and last <br/>
night a friend of min started doing Limited Edition AIRBRUSHED T-<br/>
SHIRTS that look absolutely awesome. TO save on costs, we are using <br/>
stock shirts that my friend(a screenprinter) has. SOme of the shirts <br/>
are white, others are colored, a whole bunch are organic cotton, a <br/>
few bamboo shirts, etc. After all, I'm not rolling in dough and can't <br/>
exactly go out and spend thousands of dollars on this.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, please take your medication or go for a psychological <br/>
evaluation to determine why you find it important to attack other <br/>
people. Is it to somehow make you feel superior, by trying to make <br/>
other people inferior. Do you get osme sort of sexual (or other) <br/>
gratification by insulting people.<br/>
<br/>
Let's put it this way ... how were you raised? WOuld you rmother or <br/>
father or anyone else you knowbe proud that you are the type of <br/>
person that prowls around ike a blood thirsty beast, looking for <br/>
weaknesses in potential prey? <br/>
<br/>
What a loser you must be to act the way you do and try to insult <br/>
people. I axtually feel sorry for you and people like you.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine what the world would be like if people tried to be as GOOD as <br/>
they could be, instead of as bad. Iagine what the world would be like <br/>
if mor epeople were positive and motivational and encouraged ideas <br/>
instead of insulting them. Imagine what the woudl would be like if we <br/>
didn't have jerks and fools who are so filled with venom and anger at <br/>
the world that they have to lash out and attack those who try to do <br/>
something good.<br/>
<br/>
Choose sides in life. What kind of perosn are you? What kind of <br/>
people do you associate with? What kind of person wdo people say you <br/>
are when you are not around?<br/>
<br/>
Geez, I suggested an idea of planting shirts. A heck of a lot of <br/>
awesome and positive and wonderful people got in touch with me and <br/>
are eager to be part of somehting new. And then there are the <br/>
others ... the insects who show up and try to ruin the picnic. Well, <br/>
the insects weren't invited and can be easily ignored.<br/>

&gt; This is a practical joke, right?  Ha, ha!  It's very funny.  <br/>
Guys...don't you get it?  She's pulling <br/>
&gt; your legs.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Burying shirts.  Ugh.  I've pulled a few logbooks out of <br/>
letterboxes that were quite ripe. You <br/>
&gt; might as well include a stamp carved out of a potato!    And stamps <br/>
never work well on fabric, <br/>
&gt; anyway.  It's very funny, though.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And she said she already had 100 shirts printed up.  Then she <br/>
said, "Oh, yeah, and they won't <br/>
&gt; be TINY shirts ... they'll be sizes that<br/>
&gt; just won't fit people as if they bought it in the store. Some will <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; YOUTH, others will be SMALL."  If she had already printed them, she <br/>
would have said, "they <br/>
&gt; ARE tiny and youth, and others ARE small." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's so OBVIOUS!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She had y'all goin' huh?  Silly letterboxers.  ;-)<br/>
