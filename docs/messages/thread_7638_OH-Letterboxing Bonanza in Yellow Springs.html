Had a wonderful day in Yellow Springs today.  It is a lovely town <br/>
with great opportunities for letterboxing. John Bryan is a pretty <br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
We found Flyfisher's proto-tree frogs: 2/3 but for the life of us <br/>
could not locate number 2, the black cocoon.  We spent a lot of time <br/>
trying but to no avail.  Found Horace Mann and Covered Bridge.<br/>
Franzsolo's Trailside box was also found today. :)Bravo on your <br/>
stamps gentlemen, they are lovely.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed the hikes, especially the Tree Frogs, even without rain <br/>
there was some nice water flowing and it was a relaxing way to <br/>
disconnect today.  The only sober note was an incredibly low-flying <br/>
fighter jet this afternoon.( I imagine due to the proximity of Wright-<br/>
Patterson)<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to get back there to find the other boxes!<br/>
