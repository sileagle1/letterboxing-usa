That's great news. I didn't think I'd get the Thunder Hole clues <br/>
posted in time for you to see them before you left. I'm glad it <br/>
worked out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I had my mom keep an eye on the site for me, because I left the day<br/>
before you did.  I called halfway through my trip and she read me the clue  :)<br/>
   I didn't want to miss one, since I don't make it up there too often.<br/>

Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
i guess anything that is posted on this email goes to everyone in the<br/>
letterbox group?   is that how it works? my son and i have just started to<br/>
get into letterboxing - it looks like a great hobby.<br/>
<br/>
so far, we have found two letterboxes in Stonington,  colin was so excited.<br/>
 we had such a good hike in a beautiful area!  the drew clan hid those<br/>
boxes?   the clues were excellent. <br/>
<br/>
anyway, please tell me more about this letterbox "rally"/"campout"?<br/>
sometime in May?  i think i read somewhere that it is in connecticut which<br/>
would be perfect for us.  i would really like to meet everyone, you all<br/>
sound like such characters!<br/>
<br/>
we are off to Newport this weekend.  are there any letterboxes there that<br/>
do not involve sailing or compass degrees? ( i am just learning about<br/>
long/latitude, shooting a line, and degrees on a compass - still a little<br/>
shaky).  <br/>
<br/>
well, if anyone has tips, pointers, helpful hints, etc., i am open to<br/>
suggestions.<br/>

Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
RE:  patches <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if i should have input, being new to this game, but i<br/>
personally think patches would be a  great thing  for the kids.  I know my<br/>
son would go crazy to earn patches, he enjoys earning them with cub scouts.<br/>
 I guess it means that much more to have an "official badge of<br/>
recognition"!  For the adults, it might be nice to have a more formal type<br/>
of organization, seems this thing is growing by leaps and bounds!  how<br/>
about a decal or window sticker for our cars pertaining to North America<br/>
Letterboxing Association?<br/>
<br/>
please let me know if i can help out in any way, i would like to stay involved.<br/>

HI EVERYONE,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
colin and i went to newport to do the purgatory point run.  sad state of<br/>
affairs, the 1st letterbox is missing.  i think we followed the clues<br/>
correctly, should it have been at the last observation station, fitch or<br/>
filch tower?  the rocks were all over turned and it was a real mess.  colin<br/>
and i looked around but saw neither hide nor hair of it - he was<br/>
disappointed.  what happens in an instance like this?  should i have tried<br/>
to replace it since i was there, or just tell someone?  and who? the group<br/>
in general?  and  actually this is all contingent on the fact that we were<br/>
looking in the right place (maybe not?) anyway, please someone let me know<br/>
the protocol for when an event like this happens.  <br/>
<br/>
the patch is great!  good design. what do pfx stand for though?  placed,<br/>
found and ?????<br/>
<br/>
can we go to the camp out on a drop in basis?  i might have to work that<br/>
weekend, but if i find out (last minute) that i can make it, may we just<br/>
show up?<br/>
<br/>
anyway happy monday everyone<br/>

Here's the address for a "planner" we put together to help you decide <br/>
on which letterboxes to visit:<br/>
<br/>
http://freepages.outdoors.rootsweb.com/~drewclan/gathering.htm<br/>
<br/>
Sorry it's not the most reliable web page we've ever put up...but <br/>
it's a way to start thinking ahead about all the choices you'll have. <br/>
We plan on bringing a stack of Drew family cluesheets, and are hoping <br/>
that Sarah and Bob will do the same with the other local boxes, so <br/>
you won't have to print out a bunch from your computer if you don't <br/>
want to. And, following past tradition, we're carving a gathering <br/>
stamp that'll be hidden just for the weekend get together. See you <br/>
soon!<br/>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I found an article about letterboxing in an arcane magazine, 
and looked up your website today.  I picked up a couple of pieces of 
Uncle Walter's carving block, from Walter himself, this morning.  Just 
thought you might like to know his product is about to undergo a major 
change.  It will be picked up by a large company dealing in other kinds of 
carving block.  Walter expects this to happen in the next few 
months.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the way, he handed me a couple of blocks gratis and I hope 
to get my daughter involved with letterboxing in the next month or two.  
Can't wait to hide our own box here in northeast MA.</div>

Welcome to letterboxing.  Having an interest in things arcane, I'm<br/>
curious what magazine carried the letterboxing information?<br/>
<br/>
Several times, I'd hoped to make it to Uncle Walter's to meet the man<br/>
and get a few blocks - another opportunity missed I guess. Let us know<br/>
how you like carving with it.<br/>
<br/>
And, you said NE Mass - well,there there are a couple in Shirley Center<br/>
(well, north central  MA I guess) that we put out last year - still<br/>
there thru the winter. <br/>

The great thing about letterboxing is that everyone has opinions and has<br/>
the freedom to participate consistent with their own viewpoint, no matter<br/>
how long one has been involved! I personally hope that everyone would<br/>
feel free to express their opinions openly. However, I also hope the day<br/>
doesn't come when people attempt to enforce their own opinions on how<br/>
others participate in the hobby. Some may want only to look only for<br/>
boxes in the woods, others due to circumstances may only find boxes<br/>
hidden in cities or along highways. It really is a truely individual<br/>
choice of how to participate. Hey, I would look for _any_ letterbox in<br/>
Florida (besides my own) at this point, even if they were a chain of<br/>
dumptser boxes ;-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
it's been awhile, but colin and i have been plugging away at the<br/>
letterboxes posted around connecticut and rhode island.  slowly but<br/>
surely!!  have not found one yet that is not a drew clan letterbox!! boy<br/>
are you guys active.   <br/>
<br/>
i do want to put my two cents in about the rest stop letterboxes.  part of<br/>
this "game" is the walkabout in the woods, and the communing with nature.<br/>
i relish the times that colin, the dog and i can take a quiet few hours and<br/>
tromp along.  we really use the time to explore the natural environment and<br/>
to discuss issues that are on my eight year olds mind.  to be able to walk<br/>
in the woods, get closer to each other and then find a treasure at the end<br/>
of the path is what attracted us to letterboxing in the first place.  i<br/>
think the hustle and bustle of rest stops does not lend itself to the<br/>
"game", plus it seems to be just to "get a stamp", not the actual hunt of<br/>
it.  also, i really like the idea of people stumbling into  letterboxing,<br/>
like it seems most of us have, through reading, or word of mouth.  i know<br/>
this sounds elitist - i don't mean it to (please everyone, don't take me to<br/>
task for it!) - but it's a delicious secret!!  <br/>
<br/>
anyway, that's how i feel. i know i haven't been doing it as long as some<br/>
others, so maybe i shouldn't offer an opinion.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On NPR's Morning Edition last week, Nina Tottenberg<br/>
said that if the<br/>
 Supreme Court supports Congress, it is in effect the<br/>
end of the<br/>
National<br/>
 Public Radio (NPR), NEA &amp; the Public Broadcasting<br/>
System PBS).  PBS,<br/>
NPR<br/>
 and the arts are facing major cutbacks in funding. In<br/>
spite of the<br/>
efforts<br/>
 of each station to reduce spending costs and<br/>
streamline their <br/>
services,<br/>
<br/>
 some government officials believe that the funding<br/>
currently going to<br/>
these<br/>
 programs is too large a portion of funding for<br/>
something which is seen<br/>
 as not worthwhile. Currently, taxes from the general<br/>
public for PBS<br/>
equal<br/>
 $1.12 per person per year, and the National Endowment<br/>
for the Arts<br/>
equals $.<br/>
64 a year.  A January 1995 CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll<br/>
indicated that 76%<br/>
of<br/>
 Americans wish to keep funding for PBS, third only to<br/>
national defense<br/>
 and law enforcement as the most valuable programs for<br/>
federal funding.<br/>
<br/>
 The Senate and House appropriations committees each<br/>
have 13<br/>
subcommittees<br/>
 with jurisdiction over many programs and agencies.<br/>
Each subcommittee<br/>
 passes its own appropriation bill. The goal each year<br/>
is to have each<br/>
 bill signed by the beginning of the fiscal year,<br/>
which is October 1.<br/>
The<br/>
 only way that our representatives can be aware of the<br/>
base of support<br/>
for<br/>
 PBS and funding for these types of programs is by<br/>
making our voices<br/>
heard.<br/>
<br/>
 Please add your name to this list and forward it to<br/>
friends who <br/>
believe<br/>
in<br/>
 what this stands for.<br/>
<br/>
 This list will be forwarded to the President of the<br/>
United States and<br/>
 the Vice President of the United States. This<br/>
petition is being passed<br/>
 around the Internet.  Please add your name to it so<br/>
that funding can <br/>
be<br/>
<br/>
 maintained for the NEA, NPR &amp; PBS.<br/>
<br/>
 HOW TO SIGN &amp; FORWARD: IT'S EASY: Please keep this<br/>
petition rolling. <br/>
Do<br/>
<br/>
 not reply to me. Please sign and forward to others to<br/>
sign. If you<br/>
 prefer not to sign, please send to the e-mail address<br/>
indicated below.<br/>
<br/>
 DON'T WORRY ABOUT DUPLICATES. This is being forwarded<br/>
to several<br/>
 people at once to add their names to the petition. It<br/>
won't matter if<br/>
 many people receive the same list as the names are<br/>
being managed. This<br/>
is for<br/>
 anyone who thinks NPR/PBS is a worthwhile expenditure<br/>
of $1.12/year of<br/>
 their taxes, a petition follows.<br/>
<br/>

 kill it-send it to the email address listed here:<br/>

 everyone you know, and help us to keep these programs<br/>
alive. Thank <br/>
you!<br/>

the entirety<br/>

 simply forwarding it. In your new outgoing message,<br/>
add your name to<br/>

<br/>
White Rock at Black Rock<br/>
<br/>
Block Island, Rhode Island<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions from Old Harbor and the Pt. Judith/New<br/>
London Ferries:<br/>
<br/>
           Take a left out of the parking lot and up<br/>
to the Rebecca statue, at the fork in the road go<br/>
straight onto Spring Street.  You will pass the<br/>
Southeast Lighthouse and the road will become the<br/>
Mohegan Trail.  Stay on this road and follow until you<br/>
see a painted  rock. The road will make a sharp right,<br/>
at that point it becomes Lakeside Drive.  After a big<br/>
pond,Fresh Pond, there will be a left(Cooneymous<br/>
Road). Take it and follow for about 1/4-1/2 mile. On<br/>
your left will be Rodman's    Hollow, enter at the<br/>
second Rodman's Hollow sign.<br/>
<br/>
           Enter the trailhead and continue on past<br/>
the info board. Go past Old Mill Road and enter the   <br/>
  turnstyle on your left. Follow the sign for the<br/>
"Short Loop". Go through the stone wall and then take<br/>
your immediate right. Go through that stone wall and<br/>
take a left. You will follow the length of that stone<br/>
wall, even when you don't see it. You will now be on a<br/>
dirt road/trail. Follow the 'ez' markings painted on<br/>
rocks along the trail. Go straight, past several side<br/>
trails and a 4-way intersection. Continue on until you<br/>
see the water. From the rock at the end of the trail<br/>
line up the flag pole at 100 degrees. Follow the trail<br/>
that heads towards the house for 20 feet. Turn around<br/>
and look under the white rock in the wall.<br/>

&gt;Colorado's claimed first letterbox (link doesn't work?)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, I'm sure there must be more we don't know about! For instance, <br/>
&gt;there are 3 or 4 letterboxes here in my area that are not on line but <br/>
&gt;are available at the EMS Store in Waterford, CT (no commercial <br/>
&gt;affiliation, BTW, but they have been great in promoting the sport in <br/>
&gt;CT)<br/>

Hey! we found this one and i'm willing to help you. This is a hard <br/>
one to find. My friend and i were hiking with both our moms. We're 12 <br/>
years old. We noticed that you really have to read the directions <br/>
very very carefully, because you might miss it. i'll give you one <br/>
clue. When they say east-to-north and then north-to-east, they mean <br/>
East-to-North coming from one way and it would be north-to-east <br/>
coming from the other way. Thhis is very dificult and it will be <br/>
incredibly hard if you don't have a compass of somekind. Also when <br/>
you're reading the compass make sure your doing it right, and have <br/>
someone check it after. Well that's all i could tell you right now. I <br/>
hope you can go back and find it this time.<br/>

Yes I do, but you are not supposed to help people solve clues<br/>
on the list.  Sorry :-)<br/>

Honestly, I haven't counted mine yet so I'm not sure where I'm at. Annie, I'm so 
sorry I didn't get a chance to sit anc chat with you after your hunt, same with 
Dan and Melissa. However, Andy and I had to leave to attend another important 
event. Something to do with Giants and Ravens. </div>
<div>Today, I shall attempt to venture out into the day's hopefully 
balmy weather (drove with my car windows down yesterday!) and quite possibly 
finish Bluff Point.</div>
<div>Oh, hey guys, I almost forgot. This saturday the 3rd, Eastern 
Mountain Sports of Waterford, CT is hosting an animal tracking clinic in 
Norwich. All are welcome to attend and it's FREE. It will be in the woods near 
the Norwich Golf Course and will be led by Richard Allen who works with us at 
our store. For more detailed directions call our store at 860-447-8448 and we'll 
sign you up on our list! Richard is very knowledgable in this area and after the 
clinic you'll be able to figure out what those little holes in the snow are when 
letterboxing!</div>

I live in Colorado, and I know Ultimate Treasure Hunters hosts games out <br/>
here. My husband and I did one last weekend at it was a blast! We played <br/>
against a bunch of friends, and another couple got to the treasure first and <br/>
won money. You should definitely check it out.<br/>

planted by Floater and Sprout<br/>
March 28 2001<br/>
at Spencer Butte Park,Eugene,Oregon,Lane County<br/>
<br/>
follow Willamette St. outside of town to the parks sign on the left<br/>
at the trail map take the blue summit trail starting to the right<br/>
<br/>
Don't let the first sign scare you.<br/>
<br/>
The next sign will point you toward SpencerButte Summit 1.0 mile.<br/>
<br/>
In this college town, make sure your grammar is correct, according to<br/>
the next sign.<br/>
<br/>
Following the free spirit of Eugene pick your own path to scramble to<br/>
the top  <br/>
<br/>
Find the blue post marker with a hiker sign<br/>
go 35 paces back down the trail<br/>
On 200 degrees go 15 paces to the base of a lone old pine tree.<br/>
<br/>
we turned around here and went back the same way.do not follow the trail<br/>
beyond the blue hiker sign-it will take you back to another parking lot.<br/>

<div>Went up to Portsmouth (NH) today with my friend and 
companion (You Inspire My Spirit).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Suzy sells sea shells down by the seashore is safe 
and sound, and has been visited several times.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The two Drew clan boxes on Odiorne Point are also 
fit as a fiddle. The first box has seen several seekers, but the second box, 
down by the bench had not received any until today!! All right, another 
first.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The best box of all was the shorthand box. That is 
a beautiful site. The box had been visited once before we got there. That visit 
took place on 01 January 2000. I must applaud these two, for as they wrote, 
there was two feet of snow on the ground.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh yes, I almost forgot, while we were up there, we 
planted another lighthouse series. This one commemorates Portsmouth Harbor Light 
on the grounds of Fort Constitution. Look for the clues shortly.</div>

<br/>
I usually stay off list and just eavesdrop occasionally, but this topic is<br/>
to volatile to resist.  It seems the more organized this sport gets, the<br/>
more rules and regulations there are to follow.  Too much!!!   Whatever<br/>
happened to people being responsible for themselves?  My son and I are in<br/>
the woods all the time, and it is up to me to make sure he (and I) are<br/>
safe.  That means being prepared.  What kind of nincompoop would go into a<br/>
new environment not  prepared?  We always carry extra water, matches,<br/>
compass, band aids, a knife, my cell phone and various other necessary<br/>
"survival" items.   We even carry a water dish for our dog who letterboxes<br/>
with us!  Maybe we should put a list on site of items it would be a good<br/>
idea to carry in the woods for people who can't figure it out!  Yipes!<br/>
What is this world coming too?  To me, it's like driving around a new city<br/>
with your gas gauge on empty.  PLAN AHEAD -  you know!<br/>
<br/>
Also, all this business of racing to find as many boxes as you can really<br/>
defeats the whole purpose I think.  What is interesting about letterboxing<br/>
is walking new places, seeing what you can along the way, and sharing time<br/>
with people you love.  The box is just a nice surprise at the end!  I pity<br/>
the people that are missing the big picture here.  Oh well, that's my two<br/>
cents<br/>

<div>Hats off to you Eric Mings! I am profoundly excited that you 
have included a letterboxing only search engine in your site! With letterboxing 
growing in exponential leaps and bounds, it is 'bound' to become more 
complicated ,with i'm sure, soon to be HUNDREDS of new ways to find clues to 
letterboxes! In fact, i'm sure that searching for new clues in obscure places 
will be one of the challenging "hunts" of letterboxing.</div>

<br/>
<br/>
Was in Washington, D.C. in the beginning of June, and discovered the<br/>
Roosevelt Island box has gone missing.  I think we followed all the clues<br/>
exactly, we found the old pier and the rock formation with the correct<br/>
bearings, but the box was nowhere to be had.  We did "beat the bush" in the<br/>
surrounding area quite extensively - so I am pretty sure we didn't miss it.<br/>
 The area is a pretty spot with well marked trails and a monument - it is a<br/>
shame the box is gone.  Also, as a sidebar - the clues said the box is<br/>
(was) located in ivy (meaning i guess the common variety ground cover ivy)<br/>
- watch out for some super duper poison ivy mixed in!!!  We definitely took<br/>
home "souvenirs" from that trip!!<br/>

Re P/F: Alot of P/F count questions lately (both on and off-list).<br/>
The answer is it is on the honor system, so if it seems in the <br/>
spirit to you, count it.  Otherwise, non-binding rules that I think <br/>
answer all of the questions that have come up recently are on the <br/>
faq at http://www.letterboxing.org/faq.html#025 (I personally would<br/>
not count things that do not have a stamp and a logbook for your<br/>
stamp -- they are not letterboxes, IMHO).<br/>
<br/>
Re hunting: There is at least one place in the east that allows <br/>
hunting in the spring.  The important thing, IMHO, is to inquire <br/>
locally and get to know the area before setting out on the trail, <br/>
whether the issue is hunting, or anything else.  Even if the clue <br/>
mentions hunting season or other considerations, these things change,<br/>
so you still cannot skip this step.<br/>
<br/>
Re water: Of course!  The more challenge the better ... my usual <br/>
rantings about the fact that the difficulty is the sole responsibility <br/>
of the hunter apply :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

HI!   The micro boxes that we planted at the zoo do have stamps and a note <br/>

We intended them to be letterboxes from the beginning.  <br/>

This was my kids' idea.  They picked out the stamps, the names and the <br/>
locations (I helped with the clues) and they would be very disappointed to <br/>
think they hadn't actually planted bonifide letterboxes to count toward their <br/>
P numbers.  :o)<br/>

If you bring along some small pieces of paper, you can leave your<br/>
stamp and thus complete the process. This would allow it to count<br/>
as a "found" if you read #25 of the LBNA FAQs. The way I read it,<br/>
It states that the stamp has to be with the box but isn't required<br/>
to be in a logbook.<br/>

<br/>
just wanted to thank the drew clan for another fabulous box - turtle creek<br/>
in essex (old saybrook).  colin and i had a great time ferreting this one<br/>
out.  drew clan, the ink pad is missing from the box.  we looked all around<br/>
the area thinking it might have not made it back in some other time - but<br/>
to no avail.  i usually have an extra ink pad with me - but today we were<br/>
traveling light.  sorry i couldn't replace it.  still, was a great day.<br/>
thanks again,<br/>

<div>Hi everyone!</div>
<div>     I live in the Chicago area 
and found out about letterboxing around  2 weeks ago. I have since carved 
my own stamp and found my 1st letterbox in Evanston, Illinois(north of 
Chi-town).Thanks Rachel. It was really interesting, exciting, and fun. I 
will be hiding some letterboxes near Chicagoland historical sites very soon. I 
am working on stamps now. Happy letterboxing.</div>

Did Haley's Hex today -  what a great spot!  How do<br/>
you manage to find these places?  I sat a while and<br/>
imagined the grotto was a place for Druid ceremonies<br/>
or Celtic dances. I could picture a big bonfire and a<br/>
stone circle and hooded figures dancing to some<br/>
ancient song.  Awesome! The only drawback was that I<br/>
didn't bring my repelling gear to get down off the<br/>
cliff (short people got no reason.....!!  LOL)  Thanks<br/>
again for another terrific box!<br/>

<div>Good morning to all,</div>
<div>     The Crosby clan and Powers 
pack spent a wonderful day letterboxing at Potato Creek State Park(Indiana) on 
Sunday Sept. 16th. Lisa Powers and 'Pop' Crosby were the ones who found the box, 
and were they excited! All of the kids(the adult ones too) had a great time 
searching for the box.Thanks to Rainbow's End for placing the 'box in such a 
nice hiking area. Good lck and happy letterboxing.</div>

<div>Good morning all,</div>
<div>        I was in 
Indianapolis, Indiana over the weekend and I decided to try my luck at finding 
the Crescent Moon Letterbox in Anderson, Indiana. I have to say what a wonderful 
place Mounds State Park is.They have a very nice nature center and the trails 
and wooded areas were excellent.I did find the 'box (great clues Crisp and 
Cookie) and relaxed for a while along the White River which runs right through 
the park. One word of warning. I did notice a good sized snake(not sure what 
kind) when I was putting the 'box back into its hiding spot. I'm sure he was 
just passing through.I didn't bother him and he didn't bother me.Be careful out 
there folks and happy letterboxing. </div>

all the compass points and paces in the text of the clue - my son always<br/>
says "Mom, let's do a box with lots of "degrees" and "steps".  He just<br/>

<p>100 COMPUTERS AT HUGE DISCOUNT!</p>
<p>On September 8, 2001 one of our best customers ordered 100 Micron PCs at $499 each. Dutifully, we called our vendor and placed the order. On September 12, 2001, our customer called and cancelled their order due to the events the previous day. We tried to cancel our order but our vendor refused to take them back.</p>
<p>NOW WE ARE STUCK WITH 100 COMPUTERS WE MUST SELL!</p>
<p>These are brand new 750 Mhz PCs with 128 MB of RAM, 20 Gigabyte hard disk drives, 52X CD-ROMS, 56K PCI modems, 32 MB ATI Xpert2000 Pro AGP video cards, integrated sound adapters, Mitsumi 1.44 floppy, mouse and keyboard. <i>Manufactured by Micron</i>, a NYSE company!</p>
<p>Our misfortune is your opportunity! We have no choice! We cant send them back and we cant store them. We have to sell them even if we dont make a profit! We have decided to lower the price on these 100 computers to <i>just $389! </i>An almost unheard of bargin. Youll <i>save $110!</i></p>
<p>We have just 100 of these computers to sell at this low price. When they are gone, your chance to save on a great computer system by a top notch company will go with them. Call us today at 662-3600. Take advantage of our mistake!</p>
<p>But do it at once, this opportunity to save money <i>will not </i>occur again!</p>

can I be expected to sit back and wait for it to be visited? I Don't know <br/>
how you all do this, I want to go back and visit it again even though I know <br/>
no one has found it yet because the clues haven't been posted yet. As soon <br/>
as my web hosts stop working on their servers I will post the clues on my <br/>

Hi, I would like to get word to the owner of a box, but cannot find that <br/>
person's email address.  The box is in RI, it is the Beavertail Lighthouse <br/>
box on Jamestown.  We found the box yesterday, Dec 16th, but it was <br/>
completely empty.  I left the plastic container where I found it, behind a <br/>
rock.  <br/>
<br/>
If you can get this info to the correct person I would appreciate it.  <br/>
Thanks!  Melissa<br/>

<p>The Lost Marker Letterbox</p></b>
<address>Lost Marker Letterbox</address>
<address>Placed by: C. Straub and his dog Molly</address>
<address>Date Placed: December 29, 2001</address>
<address>Location: Mansfield Center, CT Tolland County</address>
<address>Rated: Moderate</address>
<p>You will need to take along your own stamp pad and a compass<span class="570321005-30122001">. </span>From the intersection of Rt. 195 and Rt. 89 in 
Mansfield Center, proceed North towards UConn. You will shortly take a left onto 
Clover Mill Road . As soon as you turn onto this road, park on the right, There 
is room for a few cars to park there, on the corner. Now you must go by foot. 
Cross Clover Mill Road and go towards the stop sign. Near the stop sign , you 
will see a path going into the woods and a wooden sign labeling the path as 
Indian Trail. This is a part of Schoolhouse Brook Park. Follow that trail. As 
you travel the trail you will cross a crumbling stone wall. Further up you will 
cross a four plank wooden bridge over a tiny stream. Shortly you will pass over 
a larger bridge and wider stream. Crossing the bridge you go between two large 
evergreens and continue down the Indian trail. The path ends and you must choose 
right or left. Be sure to make the right decision. As you travel on this new 
trail, the path is as wide as a dirt road. When you come to a Y in the trail, do 
not travel up the Hall. The trail gets smaller and soon you cross a four plank 
bridge, over a small stream that is usually dry. A rocky twisting path this is. 
Stick to your trail, no skiing we will do. Still rocky, winding and hilly you 
finally come to a upside down Y. Bear left. We will not ski today. From this 
upside down Y in the path, 115 steps you will take. On the right, a foot or two 
off the path is a medium sized oak tree with several rocks leaning against it. 
This is a near a curve in the trail. Stop on the path in front of that oak and 
get out your compass. Now off the trail and south you will go. Yes, up that hill 
and through the brush and trees. Constantly looking at your compass, keep going 
South. Do not wander off the track as you go south of that oak. Over the rocky 
wooded ground you go. It’s not so hilly anymore. Next up a bigger hill, over the 
top it’s not so hilly but still very wooded. Constantly looking at your compass 
do not wander off a southern route. Do not go down a hill and into a small 
valley. While standing on the hill in front of this valley, look to your left 
and you should be right at your goal. There is a sloping boulder with a stack of 
stones on top of it. The stack of stones is three to four feet high. On the 
southeastern side of the base boulder along the ground you will see large stones 
leaning between a dead tree trunk and the boulder. In a hollow on the ground, 
between these stones, dead tree trunk and the base boulder is your prize. You 
have found the Lost Marker letterbox . You may have to move a few of these 
stones to get to the box. Beware of creatures that may be in this covered spot. 
The original piled stones on top of the boulder should not be moved these were 
placed long ago and may have historical value. There is also no need to move any 
of these. The rocks around the dead tree trunk and base boulder were placed 
there by myself and can be rearranged if necessary. This is where your prize is, 
take your time to mark the books. No one will see you here. To get back to the 
path, constantly walk North and you will arrive on the same trail you left 
within a few feet. I counted 220 steps to get back to the trail. From there, 
backtrack down the paths to you<span class="570321005-30122001">r</span> car.

<p align="left">This letterbox has not show up (as of yet) on the regular 
list.  It is in the "What's New" category.  This letterbox should be 
placed under Campobello Island, New Brunswick, Canada.  Is it possible that 
it has been placed on the site but somewhere else?? Thanks!!</p>

<p align="left">Annabelle Jane Fletcher was my aunt and most importantly my 
friend. I place this letterbox on her island where she was born, raised and

years. Make sure you stop by for a visit. It is free of charge and she would 
have loved to show you around "her park". </p>

</b><p align="center">Clues: </p>
<p align="left">Cross the bridge from Lubec, Maine to Campobello, Island, New 
Brunswick, Canada. Stop at the border crossing (note: this is not a toll booth, 
many people think it is! You are entering Canada - the border officials are 
really nice - just tell them you are visiting Roosevelt Park for the day - dont 
forget identification i.e. drivers license or birth certificate).</p>
<p align="left">After you pass through the border proceed to Herring Cove by going 
straight. You will pass Roosevelt Park on your left (Franklin Delano Roosevelts 
summer home - you may want to visit here before or after your walk - its free!) 
Proceed 1.5 km (about 3/4 mile) past the Roosevelt Park entrance. You will come 
to an intersection, turn right. The next road you see will see is the Herring 
Cove Road (about a 1/2 mile from the intersection) take this right. Proceed to 
the end of this road (pass the Herring Cove Golf Course &amp; Herring Cove 
Campground). Park at Herring Cove Beach. Face the sea from the parking lot, 
there is a path that leads to your left. Walk up this trail and you will soon 
see another trail leading to your right which is the Herring Cove Overlook. Look 
under the set of steps leading to the overlook. There awaits your prize!!</p>

Hi There,
</p><p>I noticed in the emails that someone found a hitchhiker that I placed
and no mention of this is under the name on the hitchhiker page. Should
the person submit the infomation somewhere else?  The below info is
what his message said. I found in the archives.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Doll's Head Swamp<br/>
<br/>
Columbus, OH  Franklin County<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Time: less than an hour<br/>
Placed: February 16, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Note: this site is muddy during wet periods.<br/>
<br/>
Location:  This box is located near a little-known nature trail in Columbus. One side trail off the main loop used to end in a swampy <br/>
area (the result of inadequate drainage as the result of building St. Rt. 315 through that area). For some odd reason, the city <br/>
stationed a green metal park bench next to the swamp, presumably so that one could sit and enjoy the view. It was in this "swamp" <br/>
that my dog, as a puppy in 1998, ran into the muck and proudly brought back to me the weathered head of a doll. I took a photograph <br/>
of my left hand holding the head with my dog in the background, grinning her big happy grin. Ever since, I have referred to this <br/>
area as the Doll's Head Swamp. Unfortunately, at some point since late winter 2001, that "swamp" was drained and cleared, and is <br/>
now part of the backyard of someone's new home. Although the swamp, the bench, and the doll's head are all now gone, it's still an <br/>
interesting little nature trail--in spite of the deafening roar of traffic on 315.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to site: Take State Rt. 315 to the Bethel Road exit. At the first traffic light, go right (north) onto Olentangy River Rd. <br/>
Travel north on Olentangy River Rd. exactly 1/2 mile. On the right, at 5400 Olentangy River Rd., you will see a one-story stucco <br/>
building housing the Columbus Police Northwest Substation. Turn right into their driveway (this is marked by a brown wooden sign <br/>
that reads "Olentangy Nature Trail" next to the entrance). Drive to the end of the driveway and park anywhere along the east side of <br/>
the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: After parking your car (it should be safe here!), you'll be facing a sign with a double-headed arrow announcing the Loop <br/>
Nature Trail. Take the right-hand trail entrance. The trail leads you through mowed grassy areas into the woods. As you enter the <br/>
woods, the trail leads uphill and eventually comes to a fork. Take the trail to the right (the trail to the left is the Loop Trail, <br/>
another grassy area can be seen just down that trail). Another fork follows immediately--ignore it and continue to the right.<br/>
<br/>
The trail eventually descends a gentle incline and comes to a wooden footbridge over a small stream. (At this point, if you cross the <br/>
bridge and continue on to the end of the trail you will have come to the spot where the "swamp" used to begin. Along this part of the <br/>
path are numerous signs that this area at one time had been someone's homestead, including an area off-trail that at one time may <br/>
have been a formal garden. You may as well take it...you've come this far!)<br/>
<br/>
If you choose not to visit the site of the former swamp, stand at the northwest corner of the footbridge and, on a bearing of 320 <br/>
degrees, sight up the hill at the line of trees--trees that appear not to belong in this area. Pick out a tree on that bearing and walk <br/>
to it, taking approximately 50 steps. At this location is a tree with a large, flat rock embedded in the base of its trunk. Standing <br/>
over this rock, turn to 240 degrees and walk along the line of trees 18 steps. Here you will find a small pile of rocks--under one of <br/>
these rocks is the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the path and retrace your steps back up the hill to the original fork in the trail. Getting back on the Loop Trail, you'll <br/>
immediately come to a grassy area with a couple of old benches and a tall pole topped with a bird house. From here the path <br/>
continues from the north side of the clearing, goes down hill, across a small stream, and up hill again to another grassy clearing <br/>
with another bird house. (During the proper time of year, this area is loaded with berries...happy eating!) Continue following the <br/>
path out of this clearing and you'll soon find yourself back at the parking lot where you started. <br/>

<body>Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Just to let you know - I received a post to the list from Inman Homes
with a .scr file attached.  My Yale server warns me that this is a
potential hybris virus/worm carrier, and removed it from my email. 
I am not sure if the attachment WAS infected - but Yale feels better safe
than sorry.  So do I -  just wanted to give everyone on list a
heads up to a potential problem.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I missed the MA gathering - sounds like it was an absolute
excellent time!  Wanda and Pete, it was great to see you "on
the road again" (did you tell the hitchhiker story?) and I guess I
will see everyone at Aili's grand Connecticut gathering in the
Spring!!<br/>

publish the clues,though, because the waterfall *had<br/>
been turned off*!  There is a dam repair project going<br/>
on and some gate had been closed so that you could<br/>
actually walk on the bottom of Barden Reservoir. :-(<br/>
<br/>
We revisited the box last night, and it had had 2<br/>
visitors. (One a friend who had the clues, and an<br/>
accidental finding. Now the water level is up to the<br/>
top of the dam but, apparently due to drought<br/>
conditions, the waterfall is not too swift.<br/>
<br/>
The clues may need some corrections with little<br/>
details on the site. Here is the link:<br/>

<br/>
Let us know if the clues need revisions/corrections.<br/>

I AGREE - WE ARE SCREWED!!  I AM SURE MARTHA SEE'S A DEFINITE COMMERCIAL<br/>
VENTURE IN THIS SOMEWHERE (pre made letterboxing kits with exacto knife,<br/>
stamp pad, carving medium.....)  Well, really, what did everyone expect to<br/>
happen when there was no secrecy involved anymore?  We have not been covert<br/>
enough in our actions - too many people know about this game.  Also, rather<br/>
than taking the time to have a nice walk in the woods, and eventually<br/>
getting to the "treasure box" - more often than not - newbies are racing to<br/>
find boxes to increase their found/placed count.  Sort of defeating the<br/>
purpose  of the whole experience I think.  WHAT A CRYING SHAME!!!!   This<br/>
game is spoiled for sure!!  Too many people tromping through the woods as<br/>
it is now!  Why does everyone feel the need to broadcast this hobby?  My<br/>
son and I found out about letterboxing 3 or 4 years ago from a 4 line blurb<br/>
in Smithsonian magazine.  We gleefully set off on our boxing adventures,<br/>
and have rarely shared our secret with people.  That may sound selfish -<br/>
but at least the game was more contained then.  Now, we can't even open a<br/>
local newspaper without running into an article on boxing.  WE ARE DONE<br/>
FOR!  Martha please, you have multi millions - do you really need to<br/>
increase your wealth yet again by commercializing a  hundred year old<br/>
hobby?  PLEASE LEAVE US ALONE!!! I am totally bummed by this whole deal.<br/>
And Leger de maine - WHAT WERE YOU  THINKING? Posting a recruitment poster<br/>
at the library?  I am sorry - but did you not think maybe the information<br/>
might fall into the wrong hands?  Let alone the local Audubon society that<br/>
lives for removing boxes from their property.  YIPES -  this is really a<br/>
sad state of affairs for sure.<br/>

I found the remains of a letterbox today that saddened <br/>
me. In New Haven at Beaver Pond Park, I found an ink <br/>
pad, a stamp that read "CT 2000" and attached to it was <br/>
a cocaine spoon and a stolen credit card. Also, not more <br/>
than a step away, were three hypodermic needles.  Please <br/>
be careful on your hikes people and wear close toe shoes <br/>
and don't hike alone.<br/>

<br/>
Take I81 to exit #45.  Go easton hwy #3. Follow the signs.  Pass the lady on<br/>
her pedistal and the clock tower. If you dodge the king and the redhead you<br/>
are on the right path. Follow the signs. Go around the circle and up the<br/>
hill.  Park in the parking lot on your left. Walk to the gate entrance, but<br/>
don't go in.  Walk 200d. and cross the drive to the corner.Turn left and<br/>
proceed to where black meets grey. From there count 13 leftsteps and turn to<br/>
240d. Walk until you see some concrete slabs hiding in the brush. Among<br/>
these is hiding what you seek.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Watertown, NY is in Jefferson County.<br/>
This is a multiple box letterbox so you want to bring paper and pen to write<br/>
the clues down.<br/>

&gt; Hi leger de maine,<br/>
I might be mistaken but did you sometime back mention the postal <br/>
letterbox? The box that finds you! I am intriqued with such an idea, <br/>
so much so I started one and in my intro letter, I gave you the <br/>
credit. Hope this wasn't in error, I haven't mailed it out yet so it <br/>
can be changed. Would you like to respond with an address in personal <br/>
email? If so, send to jurneez@yahoo.com or journeys@snet.net.<br/>
<br/>
I always embrace every new twist of letterboxing. With the warmer <br/>
weather coming and much to do (gardens, lawns, the house etc. etc.)<br/>
I'd love a letterbox that found me!<br/>
Take care,<br/>
jurneez and Vinnie the Dog.  <br/>

Placed 04-13-02 by Lit'l Davy C. and Wolf Den of 
503- Boone's Cave SP- NC<br/>After replacing 
Boone's Cabin letterbox, continue the loop on the roadbed back to the entrance 
to the park.  As you enter the park you will see a huge arrowhead. From 
there head 145 degrees for 14 paces.  Then turn 230 degrees for 32 
paces.  Then turn 280 degrees for 10 paces to a stump.  In the stump's 
hollow detachment you should find a collage of a stamp. Each cub scout did a 
wonderful job on a 4 part stamp.</p><br/>
<p><b>NRT #1</b>    Placed 03-16-02 by 
TrailSeeker    Wythe County, VA.  <br/>Starting place is any New River Trail access.  Along 
the New River Trail,  heading south of  Foster Falls Village, pass 
trail courtesy sign to nature's picnic table overlooking the New River.  
Resting here look 90 degrees and you will see some animal dens.  Go to the 
one with a shelf at it's entrance.   This shelf holds the NRT 
letterbox.  Don't give up if it's not there. It has been found a few feet 
from it's hiding place before, but please return it to it's proper home on the

<br/>
Hello, I assume you were responsible for placing the letterbox in Harpers<br/>
Ferry back in 1999. I wanted to let you know that you placed it on National<br/>
Park Service Property, and has been collected as abandoned/unattended<br/>
property. At this time, activites such as letterboxing and geocaching are<br/>
not allowed on lands owned by the National Park Service. The letterbox is<br/>
in the governments possession at this time and if you do want it back, I<br/>
can send it to you COD or you can make arrangements to pick it up in<br/>
Harpers Ferry through me. I would ask that you do not place any more<br/>
letterboxes on National Park Service property, as you can be subject to<br/>
fine. Thanks for your cooperation.<br/>

I'm not sure what their concern is.  Has any letterboxer approached <br/>
the Park Service and explained what it is that we do and don't?  <br/>
Maybe some sort of guidlines can be crafted so that we can continue <br/>
to enjoy letterboxing in OUR national parks and they can continue to <br/>
enjoy our patronage.  There are obviously guests to the park that are <br/>
far more intrusive into the habitats than we (as letterboxers) ever <br/>
are and those guests are quite welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Something positive and proactive needs to happen so that the hobbies <br/>
of letterboxing and geocaching aren't driven underground and treated <br/>
as some sort of outlaw secret societies.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Letterbox in Harpers Ferry<br/>
&gt; To: randy@m...<br/>

&gt; Randy,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hello, I assume you were responsible for placing the letterbox in <br/>
Harpers<br/>
&gt; Ferry back in 1999. I wanted to let you know that you placed it on <br/>
National<br/>
&gt; Park Service Property, and has been collected as <br/>
abandoned/unattended<br/>
&gt; property. At this time, activites such as letterboxing and <br/>
geocaching are<br/>
&gt; not allowed on lands owned by the National Park Service. The <br/>
letterbox is<br/>
&gt; in the governments possession at this time and if you do want it <br/>
back, I<br/>
&gt; can send it to you COD or you can make arrangements to pick it up in<br/>
&gt; Harpers Ferry through me. I would ask that you do not place any more<br/>
&gt; letterboxes on National Park Service property, as you can be <br/>
subject to<br/>
&gt; fine. Thanks for your cooperation.<br/>
<br/>

Please keep in mind the past posts concerning this subject...it'll <br/>
make the NPS action a "little" more understanding.<br/>
The NPS lumps geocahing in the same group as LB...and since <br/>
geocaheing often involve actually burying the box...the NPS is <br/>
worried about poeple digging holes, etc. in the park.<br/>
Now...letterbox, accroding to the standards, are NOT buried, but the <br/>
NPS still lumps us with geocahing...so we're banned.<br/>
At least the park manager was nice enough to return the box. The last <br/>
time this happen they wanted to press charges right away.<br/>
Quite frankly I see the NPS problem as a reminder that letterboxing <br/>
is not smiled upon by everyone and descretion in opening and placing <br/>
boxes is a big part of the sport.<br/>

<div>Last week a friend and I set out to find your letterbox ("Six Layers of<br/>
History") even though the letterboxing website said it had been removed. <br/>
We throughly enjoyed the search, and the writing of the clue elicited a<br/>
compliment from a Harpers Ferry guide who said it was well researched (we had<br/>
to ask him for some details).  Anyway, I wanted to say that we replaced<br/>
the letterbox with one of our own, and was wondering if you would like to<br/>
change this on letterboxing.org.  Thanks, </div><br/>

                    <html><body><p>I've never written clues for a letterbox before, so please excuse me if I do something wrong. Here goes.</p>
<p>These letterboxes were planted by three teams of children attending the Camp Exploration summer camp at Windham Center school in Windham, CT. (Windham county). The directions are as follows:</p>
<p><br/>The Huskies letterbox:</p>
<p>Go to Windham center school. It's located along Rt. 14 in Windham, CT. Park on the east side of the school. Walk past the swings and seesaws, and around the portables to the back. Go past a cement block, and follow the path behind the backstop. Continue until you reach a small clearing with 4 paths. Take the left path. Walk 39 small steps. The box is hidden on your left, where three trees grow out of one trunk.</p>
<p>The Wildcat letterbox:</p>
<p>To reach the Wildcat letterbox, continue along the path you left to find the Huskies letterbox. Keep going until you see a small pond. (At some points in the year, this pool will be dried up.) Go right around the pool until you see a stone wall. The box is hidden under the fifth rock from the left on the bottom.</p>
<p>The DJ JAAKS letterbox:</p>
<p>Now go back to the clearing. With your back to the trail you found the two letterboxes on, turn left, and take the trail. Your treasure will be on your right, 40 small steps down the trail, in an abandoned animal home a little ways off the trail.</p>
<p>Good luck!! :)</p>

Most athletic supply stores, such as Jock and Jill, have a desk where <br/>
you can find out about races and get entries.<br/>
<br/>
You might look at the Nike web site and see if they have a section of <br/>
races for your area.<br/>
<br/>
Most Newspapers have a activity section once a week ( friday?) that <br/>
might include a running section where you will find race listings.<br/>

Of course my favorits walking activity is bird watching.  Inexpensive <br/>
binoculars and Peterson's "Western Birds" is all you need to start.<br/>

The Little Devil Downpour Lettterbox was placed Saturday,<br/>
July 27th, in Shenandoah National Park in Warren County,<br/>
Virginia, by Dan Rinzel and Christine Chumbler.<br/>
<br/>
Find the Cemetery on the trail at skyline mile 19.<br/>
Walk uphill to the first yellow blaze.<br/>
Beyond it, about 50 yards, a pile of rocks<br/>
visible to the left of the trail. You will need<br/>
to look carefully at the pile. If you reach the<br/>
second yellow blaze, you went too far.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is also a bookcrossing zone.<br/>
( see http://dan2bit.bookcrossing.com ) If you<br/>
find the book, please take it with you. If you<br/>
want to leave a small paperback, register it<br/>
with bookcrossing.com and keep the relay going.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox could probably use a slightly bigger<br/>
container (half gallon size, maybe?) if the kind soul who<br/>
finds it has such an item.<br/>
<br/>
It's our first effort, so feedback is appreciated.<br/>
A copy of these clues is posted at<br/>

Dear Sirs<br/>
<br/>
Please, find enclosed a new clue about a letterbox ( I think the first in<br/>
Germany) I have installed on July 06th, 2002<br/>
in the Palatina Mountains in South-West Germany.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if you put this clue in the Talk list.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>

<p>Drive into entrance to Mingo Creek County Park (near Monongahela, PA) off of Little Mingo Road.  You will pass Henry Bridge, a red covered bridge on your left.  After a short driving distance, be on the lookout for a little sign on the left side of the road pointing the way to the Hemlock Trail, where you will begin your adventure. </p>
<p>After crossing the footbridge over Mingo Creek, climb the 14 steps and follow the Hemlock Trail up the hill.  At the fork in the path, stand in the center of the fork and take a heading of the path to your left.  Remember this degree heading...you'll need it later.  Don't take the path to the left, but continue straight on the Hemlock Trail.  </p>
<p>On your right, you'll pass the "Holly" tree--a tree that is stripped bare of bark and splits into two trunks about seven feet up the trunk.  </p>
<p>Keep going until you see a tree on the right that has broken from its trunk but is still suspended across the path.  It should be the only tree that crosses the path above you.  Another branch of the fallen tree will come back to earth on the right side of this path.  If the path becomes noticeably thicker and overgrown, you have gone too far.  Stand at the south face of the broken stump and find the same heading of the left path that you measured earlier.  Seven steps from the south face of this stump you will see an unremarkable, lonely, little stump.  Just inside and behind a rock, you will find the Henry Ebenezer letterbox, named for the two beautiful covered bridges in the park.  When you get back to your car, be sure to drive farther into the park and see the second covered bridge, The Ebenezer Bridge, before you leave the park.</p>

Hi there, I apologize for emailing you, but I wasn't sure who else might <br/>
know the email addresses of people who have placed letterboxes. My husband <br/>
and I went looking for the Raptor's Roost letterbox in South Mountain Park, <br/>
AZ.  We found the remnants of the tupperware, but with no stamp or journal <br/>
to be found.  (Some mean-spirited people must have torn it apart.)  The <br/>
clues said that "Funhog" placed the box, and I don't know how to tell <br/>
him/her that it was torn apart.  We hid the box again because we weren't <br/>
sure what to do.  Can you either let funhog know and update the webpage, or <br/>
let me know funhog's address?  Thank you so much.<br/>
<br/>

 Not surprising.  I drove up there while storm chasing a couple weeks <br/>

parking lot looked like a gang-banger convention.  Funhog's lovely <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In a forum where most of the users are adults, or are supervised by <br/>
adults, it's disappointing to see this kind of bickering like that <br/>
between children.   A situation that is all TOO easy to become <br/>
engaged in.<br/>
<br/>
Not more than a month ago a calm discussion was had regarding <br/>
possible improvements to the website to help adapt to the growing <br/>
number of letterboxers and clues.  Initially it put some people up in <br/>
arms because they thought that others didn't understand how much work <br/>
the webmasters already do.  When it was made clear that the majority <br/>
knows, understands and praises the webmasters for their hardwork and <br/>
dedication, a rather pleasant discussion of possibilities ensued.  <br/>
People even volunteered their skills to assist if needed.  <br/>
<br/>
Can not a similar DISCUSSION be had about issues people feel are <br/>
important rather than slinging insults and sarcasm around?  A topic <br/>
of discussion might be about the use of various marks added to the <br/>
customary P, F and X's.  This can, and in a way IS getting out of <br/>
control.<br/>
Then again, this isn't an olympic sport.  As has been stated <br/>
*numerous* times, it is JUST a hobby that people have discovered in <br/>
various ways over the years.  Hobbies are personalized.  Not every <br/>
wood-carver works on oak.  We all have different signatures.  Should <br/>
letterboxing have some sort of general *rules*?  Who has the right to <br/>
make them up?<br/>
<br/>
I'm open to change and I'm a person that respects history and custom.<br/>
Perhaps instead of insult and curse we can lead and teach one <br/>
another.  I, for one, would love to know more about letterboxing <br/>
"customs" as I haven't been around for all that long.  <br/>
<br/>
This is a place for a letterboxing community.  Be it clues, questions <br/>
about carving, hiking socks, etc....I came here with the <br/>
understanding that I would LEARN and from MANY kind and welcoming <br/>
people I HAVE and I hope to continue to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Life's too short for this.  Let's all take a deep breath, be <br/>
respectful to one another and Letterboxing and get on with the <br/>
HELPFUL stuff.  <br/>

Just FYI, we found the first letterbox at this site, but the second one must be<br/>
missing.  We found the bench by the electrical box and the scrub oak is all<br/>
around the bench.  We looked and looked and could not find the box.  We did see<br/>
2 black bear and wonder if animals took it!  How can we notify the owner?<br/>

Thank you.<br/>

been tryin to send this a few different ways and having no luck. going to <br/>
try this way now.<br/>
<br/>
Hello, this is my first box that I am placing out in the wild.  I have just <br/>
started this wonderful hobby and was hooked right away.  Here are the clues <br/>
to my first box:<br/>
<br/>
Day "27"<br/>
<br/>
We pulled our birch-bark canoes out of the lake to take a two and a half <br/>
mile portage.  This place is frequented by fur traders, but we are here for <br/>
the wild rice and berries.  Although we have also used this trail during the <br/>
war with the Sioux.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From this Historical marker, take a heading of 350*  Follow the grassy trail <br/>
up.  Near the top of the hill, stop.  The trees will be thinner up here.  At <br/>
a heading of 160*, take this time to look at beautiful lake Windigo.  <br/>
Continue walking down the grassy path until you get to a "Y" intersection.  <br/>
At the intersection head North.  Follow this path until you get to a gravel <br/>
road.  Cross the road and take about 40 paces North down the grassy path.  <br/>
On your right will be 2 oaks.  One with lots-o-the-lichen on it and one with <br/>
none.  At the base of these trees will be what you seek.<br/>

Subject: Re: Sig. Stamp Question<br/>
To: letterbox-usa-owner@yahoogroups.com<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about this myself recently.  I have used my sig. <br/>
stamp in several geocache logs and a few letterboxes, and I'm not <br/>
ready to change it yet but do anticipate I will want to someday.  To <br/>
me, it seems that writing your "name" in the logbook as well as <br/>
stamping somehow solidifies the identity and allows for growth and <br/>
change in imagery.  As long as we continue to log and record the rest <br/>
of our info in a consistent manner, I see no reason why the stamps <br/>
can't evolve and still represent us.  I'd like to think that others <br/>
would appreciate one's desire to enhance/change their sig. stamp.  <br/>
That's why I spend a lot of time carving stamps - it makes me feel <br/>
good, and I want others to feel that way and enjoy them as much as I <br/>
do.  So changing imagery wouldn't be indecisive or wishy-washy <br/>
(although I feel that way quite often) - we grow and change as <br/>
people, and these sigs. are part of us.<br/>
Anyway I guess its kinda like changing outfits or haircolors - still <br/>
you under there, just looks a little different!<br/>

Cucumber Gap Trail Letterbox<br/>
Nearest town: Gatlinburg, TN<br/>
Smoky Mountains<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: T&amp;A, B&amp;J (the crazy campers, yo)<br/>
August 31, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Locate Elkmont campground on the north-central side of the park on a<br/>
trail/road map. Drive to the campground, do not enter, turn left instead.<br/>
Drive past the Elkmont Nature Trail and follow the road past the old cabins<br/>
to Jake's Creek Trail/Cucumber Gap Trail. Begin here!<br/>
<br/>
Please note that this was a last minute idea while we were in the park so<br/>
this box has no ink pad!<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Beyond the gate begins this trail.<br/>
Go over the bridge without a rail.<br/>
Around the bend, past the leaning tree,<br/>
then you'll start heading right, you see.<br/>
<br/>
Around the curves you'll go.<br/>
Its all uphill, you know.<br/>
A sharp left at the Cucumber sign,<br/>
then you'll walk past trees and vines.<br/>
<br/>
On your right, a stump turned upside down.<br/>
Keep walking past piles of branches on the ground.<br/>
Be careful, the trail narrows where<br/>
a small stump to the left on the trail tells you're almost there.<br/>
<br/>
There's a sleeping green monster to the right up ahead.<br/>
This looks like a good spot, but go past him instead.<br/>
When its the trickle of water you hear,<br/>
you'll know that you are very near.<br/>
<br/>
You need to go only a little further yet.<br/>
Be careful not to get your feet too wet!<br/>
As water passes under your shoes,<br/>
look left for the kissing rocks in your view.<br/>
<br/>
Now stand on those rocks and face the nearest tree.<br/>
Look across the path, the box hides under the boulder you cannot see.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

&gt;From Rt. 29, turn onto Old Columbia Rd at the mini golf place.  Go left at Harding Road.  Park in the 2nd large parking lot after the boat ramp.  Head down the hill on the left side of the parking lot and follow the path left into the woods.  Continue on path past Pride Rock (sadly spraypainted now) and cross the dry creek bed.  After you pass the small sawn-off tree in the middle of the trail, you will come to a 3-way split.  Follow the middle path through the woods until it dead-ends at the water.  Go all the way to the shoreline, then turn 180 degrees.  The badly-carved prize is inside the base of the oak with the large burl to the left of the path.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is simple, but it's my first box - hopefully the clues will be more<br/>
entertaining with practice - and I thought the spot was so pretty.<br/>

The hunt for this box should be easy, short and has a nice view of<br/>
the river.  <br/>
<br/>
According to ZZ Top, what is every girl crazy about?  A sharp dressed <br/>
man.  Shouldn't that be "sharply dressed" man?   And what does that <br/>
mean?  I ramble.  Humorously, I never really liked ZZ Top that much<br/>
as a kid.  Now I'm naming letterboxes after their songs?  Very <br/>

  Here is a letter I got this morning. It's from a CINCINNATI park about <br/>
letterboxing.  They Removed my Sith Box #5 (Which is a park of 10 boxes) with <br/>
out you can not finsh the challange.<br/>
<br/>
  They say it's in a Dangerous curve.  This is a small and has no places to get <br/>
up to any kind of speed, and as long as I have been hiking in this park I have <br/>
never heard of ANYONE being hit here, ALSO it's a road that people jog on ALL <br/>
OF THE TIME!!!! so it's not like people do not travel/WALK this road.  (NOTE) <br/>
what the end of there letter says<br/>
<br/>
  ( We have a couple and we feel more than three or four could harm the fragile <br/>
ecosystems here) <br/>
<br/>
This is the same statment that the Hamilton County parks are now saying.<br/>
<br/>
 Damn, They want OUR tax money to run the park BUT HEY we can only do what THEY <br/>
say.  Sound like Big Brother to me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 "I will also go on record. I have tracked the Tri-State area for 22 years <br/>
now.  I have been doing letterboxing for about 8 months now and I have yet to <br/>
see any type of REAL damage. Most letterboxes see about 5-10 visits per<br/>
box per year (In the tri-state area) We do not HURT any parks. This is just a <br/>
Control issue and it's Sad VERY VERY sad.<br/>
<br/>
 This is your chance to say something. The Number to the park is in the letter, <br/>
Pick up your phone and give the number a call. (DO NOT BE NASTY) be nice and <br/>
let them know that as a Letterboxer/Tax Payer or better yet<br/>
<br/>
     naturalist<br/>
<br/>
 You are not happy with the park system and removing the letterboxes as <br/>
LETTERBOXES DOES NOT HURT the ecosystem. it brings people with your Young ones <br/>
out INTO it and teaches them about the ecosystem.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am a naturalist at California Woods Nature Preserve. I want to let you<br/>
&gt; &gt; know that because of the location of your geocache sith # 5 we had to<br/>
&gt; &gt; remove it.  The place it was located is the most dangerous part of our<br/>
&gt; &gt; preserve.  Many cars come around that bend and do not see anyone in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; road until it is too late.  We like the existing geocaches, but we already<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a couple and we feel more than three or four could harm the fragile<br/>
&gt; &gt; ecosystems here. The items of the cache are here at our office. We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; normally here M-F from 8-4:30. Please call us at 231-8678 if you have any<br/>

a box adds to the intrigue of the overall seek and discovery <br/>
experience, I also consider the art of stamp carving to be an <br/>
interesting hobby of itself, and worthy of sharing.<br/>
<br/>
And since I am living and we are planting the majority of our boxes <br/>
in West Michigan, where letterboxers are few and far between, it is <br/>
conceivable that many of our boxes will weather the cold Michigan <br/>
winter with barren logbooks.  So to give a little peeksy as to what <br/>
one may expect to find should they happen to be passing by this way <br/>
(does anyone ever just happen to be passing through Michigan?) and <br/>
have the opportunity to engage in a little letterboxing, I have <br/>
posted a few stamps to the files area.  Not that my stamps would be <br/>
so desirable as to lure one here, but also consider that Mirkwood has <br/>
some very interesting clues and stamps on the east side of the state, <br/>
and that Michigan in itself is a really cool state to visit...  <br/>
<br/>
Enough said.  Hope to see some of you soon.<br/>

<br/>
Planted by The Family.  Butterbaby and rtrw on October 26 ,2002<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - simple<br/>
Time - drive up<br/>
Directions to starting place - Route 149 to the center of Deering,<br/>
New Hampshire.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - <br/>
I can't think of anything that important for this spot.<br/>
<br/>
Facts that you don't need to know, but may find interesting - <br/>
The town was named for Governor Wentworth's wife, Frances Deering. <br/>
At one time Deering had eleven public schools.  One of the two <br/>
remaining buildings is this library.  In 1860 Deering had several <br/>
stores, many water mills, three post offices, two hotels and many <br/>
successful farms. Ebenezer Locke, the man who allegedly fired the <br/>
"shot heard round the world" at Lexington, Massachusetts that began <br/>
the Revolutionary War is buried in Deering.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:		<br/>
On Route 149 near the town hall and the church look around for the <br/>
Deering Public Library.  It's sort of behind the town Hall at the <br/>
corner of Fisher Road.  Stand directly in front of the DPL sign so <br/>
that you can read it.  Go to the left two steps then right five<br/>
steps.  The books you seek are behind a small stone next to a <br/>
foundation rock.    <br/>
<br/>
Please email rtrw@attbi.com with any box needs or info.  <br/>

<br/>
Planted by rtrw on October 10th ,2002<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - fairly simple, I think<br/>
Time - 15 minutes to the box, but plan an hour or more for the box<br/>
and the building.<br/>
Directions to starting place - K-61 highway, turn east on 30th<br/>
avenue. The nature center is at 3002 East 30th  Avenue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know -  The nature center is a terrific place with <br/>
great interactive exhibits and animals.  Definitely worth seeing.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know - It appears that you can fish in the <br/>
pond.  the web site www.hutchrec.com/DNC/dillon.htm will help answer <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:		<br/>
Start out at the Dillon Nature Center. <br/>
At the northwest corner of the building find the memorial bench for <br/>
Logan Neufeld.  Have a seat and enjoy the view.  Nearby there is <br/>
always going to be a boy catching frogs.<br/>
Head Northwest on the paved path keeping the pond on your left, going <br/>
past some lovely gardens<br/>
Take the right side of the "Y"<br/>
You will come to an intersection of 5 trails<br/>
Go 17 paces up the northeast path<br/>
On the right side of the path in the northern end fallen log you <br/>
should find your treasure.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Place By:  Irish Mum<br/>
Date Placed: 10/31/02<br/>
Location: Mansfield, CT<br/>
Rated: EASY,Very short walk, <br/>
            COMPASS NEEDED<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take RTE 195 in Mansfield,CT to Clover Mill Rd. Immediately as you <br/>
enter Clover Mill Road, there is a trail marker for the "Indian <br/>
Trail" on your left. Park directly across from the trail in the dirt <br/>
area on the right side of the road. Walk across Clover Mill Road to <br/>
the trail entrance. This is also the starting point for "The Lost <br/>
Marker Letterbox". Follow the narrow trail through the woods and over <br/>
a crumbling stone wall. Cross a small wooden bridge and continue on <br/>
to a larger bridge. Cross the bridge (Watch out for the gaps!)and <br/>
stand on the last plank between the 2 large pine trees. Take a <br/>
compass reading of 320 degrees. Take 8 paces (count left foot only)in <br/>
that direction to a dead pine tree standing tall,like a totem pole.  <br/>
Around the back of the tree covered with bark is the Totem Pole <br/>
Letterbox. Back track to your car or continue on to find the Lost <br/>
Marker Letterbox. <br/>

Subject: Letterbox removed in monrovia<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to say that the letterbox that was hidden in Monrovia Canyon Park<br/>
entitled Another Waterfall Letterbox has been removed by Park personnel.<br/>
The reason for this is due to recent problems with related treasure seekers<br/>
known as geocachers.   The high volume of seekers and boxes hidden well off<br/>
the trails were causing extreme damage to native vegetation, massive erosin<br/>
on canyon sides and disrupting wildlife which is our mission to preserve.<br/>
Therefore hide and seek games such as this have been prohibited within the<br/>
park and all boxes will be removed.  If the owner of this box would like to<br/>
have there box returned, it can be picked up at the Nature Center office.<br/>
Thank you for your understanding and if you have any further questions feel<br/>
free to contact me.<br/>
<br/>

                    <html><body><div>Skidaway Island Letterbox</div>
<div>Skidaway Island, GA Chatham County</div>
<div>Nearest town:  Savannah, GA</div>
<div>Date placed: 2/8/03  </div>
<div>Difficulty:  Easy</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Driving Directions:</div>
<div>From I-95, take GA 204 E approx. 10.6 miles.  Turn right on GA Spur 204 E (Montgomery Crossroads).  Go approx. 1.3 miles.  Turn right onto Waters Ave. (you will still be on Spur 204E).  Follow this road approx. 5.5 miles until you see the sign for Skidaway Island State Park.  Turn left at sign for Skidaway Island State Park.  Drive into the park (there is a $2 parking fee) and go past the park office.  When you get to the stop sign you will see the Museum/Interpretive Center.  There will be parking areas to the left and right.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Directions to the Letterbox:</div>
<div>Walk on the right side of the Museum/Interpretive Center and follow the sign to the Sandpiper Nature Trail.  Begin walking the trail.  After crossing the boardwalk and two bridges, follow the trail to Marker G.  Turn to your right on a little used trail just past Marker G.  You will see palmetto clumps on the right-hand side of the trail.  Stop at the 4th palmetto clump and turn left.  You should be facing a dead, fallen oak tree.  The letterbox is concealed underneath the tree.  Beware of critters who may have made a home there also!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finish the trail - comes out on the left side of the museum.  Beautiful area, scenic walk!</div>

John Bordsen, the reporter for the Charlotte Observer, asked me to<br/>
post these clues, and asked that they be posted to the web site.<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
Name of letterbox: Charlotte Observer<br/>
Date Placed: Jan. 19, 2003<br/>
State/County placed: North Carolina, Mecklenburg County<br/>
Name of nearest town: Charlotte<br/>
<br/>
In Charlotte's bustling uptown, the area bounded by the Interstate<br/>
277-Interstate 77 loop, is a historical marker (as well as a street)<br/>
honoring a man from a landmark business. Our kind of guy. Find the marker -<br/>
it's on a pole - and walk to the nearest corner.<br/>
Now walk west. You'll have lots to see, but if the VW Beetle Invasion Ends,<br/>
you've gone 130 paces too far.<br/>
 Look south. Where you want is loaded with pillars. Find a row of four of<br/>
them - no more, no less. A touch of big brother is affixed to one of them,<br/>
and it points to a wall. <br/>
Find the sign on the wall that reminds you of every week of the year. Now,<br/>
look two signs to your right and do what that sign says.<br/>
Once you've accomplished this, step forward; to your right, you'll see a<br/>
lighthouse in the distance.<br/>
 Walk 46 paces around the curve, away from the beacon, and seek out "escvx."<br/>
<br/>
Now, when nobody's looking, look behind it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The mystery of the Stack's House letterbox Revealed  (NOT)<br/>
<br/>
After three visits I have discovered the true mystery of the Stacks <br/>
House Letterbox.  Does it really exist?<br/>
<br/>
Visit Number One:  After some extensive research we found what we <br/>
were quite certain was the right place to look.  The next day we <br/>
visited it over lunch hour.  There seemed innumerable good hiding <br/>
places though nothing in the clues revealed exactly where.  <br/>
Surreptitiously we inspected cabinets, corners and little hiding <br/>
places.  No luck.  Finally we carefully asked someone there.  We <br/>
remembered that the Smithsonian microbox went missing when someone <br/>
very UNdiscretely asked about it.  We carefully asked someone, "Do <br/>
you know what a letterbox is?"  "No.  Never heard of it."  We asked <br/>
if she knew an Amy.  "Oh, yes she works nights."  Finally we talked <br/>
to the person who might be Marcus but without saying the word <br/>
letterbox.  No luck from this fishing.  We decided to go home and <br/>
write the placer.<br/>
<br/>
We wrote the placer who kindly responded that, "Yes you have to ask <br/>
but not those you did since they wouldn't know anything."  She said <br/>
to ask someone like Marcus.<br/>
<br/>
Visit Number Two:  All we had to do was ask the someone like Marcus.  <br/>
Great.  Back we went over lunch hour again.  We asked the one like <br/>
Marcus.  He wasn't Marcus and he had no idea what we were talking <br/>
about, but he'd ask Amanda.  Marcus would be working tonight though.  <br/>
While waiting for Amanda we asked someone else, also no luck.  Amanda <br/>
came over.  "Hi, we are looking for the Stack House letterbox which <br/>
we understand is kept _____."  "Oh, I know about that.  But I don't <br/>
know where it is.  I'll look for it for you."  She left.  And she <br/>
never returned.  Having twice heard that Amy and Marcus worked at <br/>
night we ran out of time and decided to return that night.<br/>
<br/>
Visit Number Three:  As we sat down we heard someone saying hello to <br/>
Marcus.  Great.  Here is Marcus our troubles are over.  "Hello Marcus <br/>
we are looking for the Stack House letterbox which we understand is <br/>
kept _____."  "Oh, I know about that.  It's in the office.  But the <br/>
office is locked and I don't have a key."  Argghhhhhhh!  We spent the <br/>
next hour listening to some very good music.<br/>
<br/>
So far we have actually had quite a good time on our visits because <br/>
the place is good to visit letterbox or no.   But I am convinced <br/>
there is no letterbox.  It must simply be a conspiracy to get you <br/>
visit.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
1.  Most people there don't know what we're talking about.<br/>
2.  Those that sort of do say we have to speak to someone who's not <br/>
there.<br/>
3.  When we return, that someone says it's locked away, we'd have to <br/>
try a different time.<br/>
4.  What will it be next time?  "Sorry someone got here before you <br/>
and took it out."  This is reminding me of Monty Python's "The Cheese <br/>
Shop".  "Sorry, we're fresh out of that one."<br/>
<br/>
Evasive?  Uh huh.  It doesn't exist.  That's what I say.  Mystery <br/>
solved!<br/>

To: letterbox-usa-owner@yahoogroups.com<br/>
<br/>
This Letterbox is located in Spokane, Washington by Liberty Park, along the <br/>
Ben Burr Trail. Two parks, Liberty and Underhill, are linked by this scenic <br/>
trail that runs along a basalt bluff that helps define the surrounding <br/>
neighborhood. It's an easy path with towering rock formations and beautiful <br/>
plant life.<br/>
<br/>
The directions or "clues" are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
To the park from Perry st. Turn on East 8th avenue. At the intersection of <br/>
8th and Pittsburgh, there will be a dead end, which has a sidewalk going <br/>
along the right hand side (Facing north). Follow the sidewalk. Go down 2 <br/>
flights of stairs. Follow a zigzag sidewalk until you see a trail to the <br/>
right. The path will go on for a little while, just continue going strait <br/>
until you see a Ben Burr trail marker/bike caution sign. From the sign, count <br/>
150 steps. To the left there is a rocky dirt path that leads up a small <br/>
cliff. Once at the top, go to the right and walk straight. You will pass a <br/>
large boulder, and go into a small clearing. There will be a large group of <br/>
bushes with an opening in the middle. Walk inside (duck, its a small area). <br/>
There will be bush branches along the ground. look around close to the bush <br/>
stumps (should be straight inside the bush opening, slightly to the left). <br/>
The "Ghetto" letterbox should be under some grass and leaves.<br/>

Does anyone know the owner of this box on the Windsor Center River Trail?  I'd<br/>
like to verify if the box is missing, or if we were just missing something this<br/>
morning!<br/>

<br/>
I recently came across your website for letterboxing and I thought it was an <br/>
excellent site and a great opportunity to spend some fun time with my kids. <br/>
I realized that one of the letterboxes was only a mile away from my house so <br/>
my four year old and I went in search of it. The box is called the Secret <br/>
Garden and is located in Royal Oak, Michigan. The box was labeled as easy to <br/>
find so I thought it would be a perfect one to start on, however the box is <br/>
gone.<br/>
Before I try this again with my kids, I'd like to know if this happens a <br/>
lot. Also, are the boxes checked periodically by the people that placed <br/>
them? Please let me know or forward this question to the appropriate person <br/>
if need be.<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Scott Beck<br/>

     I find it ironic that Scott sends his question through Randy. <br/>
When I asked Randy if one of his mystery boxes (which I had solved, <br/>
but it would be a 3 hour round trip) was still viable. I got back, <br/>
that's the chance you take. <br/>
     That is the one feature I like on the geocache board. You can <br/>
see if others had trouble, didn't or did find the cache. <br/>
     At least we are in control of our boxes. So if a report comes in <br/>
that one is missing, we can check if it is and then delete it.<br/>
     I hate to have people waste a trip. I realize that people are <br/>
going to say, "Well you did enjoy the walk, right?" Not all boxes <br/>
involve hikes.<br/>
     One of my mystery boxes was on the corner of my property (has <br/>
been pulled) and silly me brought it in the house the day I planted <br/>
it 'cause it was raining. I didn't think anyone would find it within <br/>
24 hours. Boy did I feel bad when Tempusfugit came for it and <br/>
discovered it not there. Most disappointing for them. They did return <br/>
that evening. So the story ended happily.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with you, especially in regards to Randy's boxes, which are <br/>
mystery boxes and are supposed to be elusive.  Those are not the type <br/>
of boxes I am talking about.  I am referring specifically to <br/>
orphaned, non-mystery boxes that have been repeatedly reported <br/>
missing, situations where it is evident that the box is truly <br/>
missing, and the planter is no longer around to either replace it or <br/>
remove it from the clues page.  So does it just stay there forever?<br/>
<br/>
The box in question is not a mystery box, it is not even really a <br/>
hike.  Even though it is a nice setting, making the trip there, <br/>
locating the spot the clues clearly specify as the hiding spot, and <br/>
not finding the box is frustrating.  Although this particular guy <br/>
lived very close to the location of the letterbox, it is not uncommon <br/>
in states such as Michigan where boxes are few and far between, for <br/>
people to drive several hours to get to letterboxes.  Even though I <br/>
agree that no hike is a wasted trip, knowing a particular box is <br/>
missing would be appreciated so that you could instead drive a few <br/>
hours in another direction for other letterboxes and get both the <br/>
hike and a box.<br/>
<br/>
I think it gives a bad impression to people who are new to the hobby <br/>
if they look for a box and obviously find the correct location <br/>
because the clues are quite specific, and the box is not there.  This <br/>
is different than not finding a box because the clues are vague or <br/>
not being quite sure you are even in the right place.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, research in the archives may yield some chatter about others <br/>
having problems finding the box, however, not everyone reads the list <br/>
or recognizes it as a source of clue information, particularly those <br/>
who are very new to the hobby.  Those who have been around the hobby <br/>
for a while realize that the list is a good source of information and <br/>
supplemental clues, etc.  But the main source of clues for <br/>
letterboxes is the LbNA web site.  A person new to letterboxing, <br/>
locating boxes in their area on the LbNA web site, should not have to <br/>
read the list and/or search the archives before setting out to look <br/>
for a non-mystery box with clear, straightforward clues.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are situations, where it is time to get rid of missing, <br/>
unclaimed boxes from the the clues page, if not entirely, then at <br/>
least move them to a "boxes in limbo" page.<br/>

trouble once or twice locating the box. I post a message on here to <br/>
see if anyone has found it recently. I don't know if people go to <br/>

don't get frustrated you will find one. <br/>

&gt; Subject: secret garden letterbox<br/>
&gt; To: mapsurfer@l...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recently came across your website for letterboxing and I thought <br/>
it was an <br/>
&gt; excellent site and a great opportunity to spend some fun time with <br/>
my kids. <br/>
&gt; I realized that one of the letterboxes was only a mile away from my <br/>
house so <br/>
&gt; my four year old and I went in search of it. The box is called the <br/>
Secret <br/>
&gt; Garden and is located in Royal Oak, Michigan. The box was labeled <br/>
as easy to <br/>
&gt; find so I thought it would be a perfect one to start on, however <br/>
the box is <br/>
&gt; gone.<br/>
&gt; Before I try this again with my kids, I'd like to know if this <br/>
happens a <br/>
&gt; lot. Also, are the boxes checked periodically by the people that <br/>
placed <br/>
&gt; them? Please let me know or forward this question to the <br/>
appropriate person <br/>
&gt; if need be.<br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">   Who said anything about numbers? I was referring to a drive. For <br/>
me, a very long drive. Which included bridge fare. I had solved the <br/>
clues, and knew where to find the box. Besides it was one that had <br/>
been placed in 1999. Therefore the question if it was still an active <br/>
box. Now that I know the rules for his boxes, I'll solve them but <br/>
won't make a special trip just to find out it washed out to sea. <br/>
   All I'm saying is it would be a nice feature to look up a box and <br/>
see a definite notation: <br/>
     a - it's was last seen on blah blah date<br/>
     b - tried to find but appears to be MIA<br/>
     c - pending while owner has a chance to confirm<br/>
  Something along that line.<br/>
   If you don't want to know and like the idea of going say 3 times <br/>
to hunt the same box then don't scroll down to that part of the <br/>
screen. I'm not a computer wiz. But I know it can be done. <br/>

P.S. My glass is always half full. That is why I'm looking for a <br/>
little improvement since it is possible. After all we are on the <br/>
internet with infinite possibilities. Dartmoor 2003. <br/>
<br/>
Its not always <br/>
&gt; about numbers....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is the glass half empty or half full??<br/>

&gt;      I find it ironic that Scott sends his question through Randy.<br/>
&gt; When I asked Randy if one of his mystery boxes (which I had solved,<br/>
&gt; but it would be a 3 hour round trip) was still viable. I got back,<br/>
&gt; that's the chance you take.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't drag me into this debate.<br/>
<br/>
I simply forwarded the message along as a _courtesy in my capacity as <br/>
list manager_.  It was a misdirected message about which I new nothing<br/>
of the subject.  I am an admirer of irony, and frankly, I do not see it<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
For my part, if I am aware that one of my boxes is missing, I post that <br/>
fact in bold at the top of the clue in question on my website.  That <br/>
is simply being polite.  This still allows those who chose to do so to<br/>
enjoy the map and the place.  I impose this view on no one else.<br/>

individual that planted it was a friend of Edugaytor, the gent that placed<br/>
the Independence Oaks boxes. I think he since left the list and I have no<br/>

that first tried to organize a MI gathering about a year ago)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I vote this box be removed due to the fact that no one has been<br/>
able to find it and the boxer is unavailable to verify that it is missing.<br/>
The park is very heavily traveled and it is very likely it was removed by a<br/>
park visitor.<br/>

&gt; Subject: secret garden letterbox<br/>
&gt; To: mapsurfer@letterboxing.org<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I recently came across your website for letterboxing and I thought it was<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; excellent site and a great opportunity to spend some fun time with my<br/>
kids.<br/>
&gt; I realized that one of the letterboxes was only a mile away from my house<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; my four year old and I went in search of it. The box is called the Secret<br/>
&gt; Garden and is located in Royal Oak, Michigan. The box was labeled as easy<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; find so I thought it would be a perfect one to start on, however the box<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; gone.<br/>
&gt; Before I try this again with my kids, I'd like to know if this happens a<br/>
&gt; lot. Also, are the boxes checked periodically by the people that placed<br/>
&gt; them? Please let me know or forward this question to the appropriate<br/>
person<br/>
&gt; if need be.<br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
&gt; Scott Beck<br/>

I am the Executive Director of Beaver Brook Association. I was <br/>
recently alerted to the fact that your site lists two letterbox <br/>
locations on our property. Although we are not opposed to this <br/>
activity on our property, these particular locations were not <br/>
approved by our organization. Unfortunately this is fastly becoming a <br/>
frequent problem. Our land is open to the public, but it is private <br/>
and any use other than the usual passive recreation activities need <br/>
to be OK'd with staff. Please alert the people who placed these <br/>
letterboxes that they will be removed and can be picked up at our <br/>
office. We will gleadly work with them to determine a mutually <br/>
beneficial site.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Let me take a few moments to put my two cents in regarding the posting <br/>
guidelines...The items in quotes are the proposed guidelines...(not mine).<br/>
<br/>
"Don't ask stupid questions"  How in the world is someone going to learn if <br/>
they don't ask questions...what you may find annoying, I may find <br/>
interesting...do what I do...skip over messages.<br/>
Personally, I find it rewarding to help people who are starting this <br/>
hobby...that's how it advances.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Don't become an excessive poster"  Not much arguments here...but in looking <br/>
at the messages...I find it rare that anyone has posted excessive <br/>
messages...so where are you getting this...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Make your suject lines count"  The word "suject" is exactly how it is <br/>
spelled on your posting...it is not a typo by me...I think you meant <br/>
SUBJECT...try spell checking before posting should also be listed on your <br/>
list...but seriously...I can tell 95 percent of the time what the topic <br/>
is...so where is the problem....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Don't reply with "Ditto" or "Me too"."  I agree...I mean Ditto...<br/>
<br/>
"The world does not revolve around you"  I was laughing parts of my anatomy <br/>
off reading this one...Does this mean that the world revolves around you <br/>
instead...Because I noticed that most of your posting was what YOU have <br/>
problems with...who did you run the whole guidelines by before you decided <br/>
to let the world in on your revelations???<br/>
<br/>
"The world does not revolve around your children, either"  Actually, the <br/>
world does revolve around children..mine, yours and everyone elses...who do <br/>
you think is gonna fund our Social Security!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Keep the subject up to date"  ok...common sense...do we really need to be <br/>
told this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Don't include attachments"  Just don't download the attachments...common <br/>
computer security here...don't download attachments from people you don't <br/>
know...and keep virus protections up to date.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Keep it readable"  I'm amused by the acronym problem you mentioned...I had <br/>
to ask what the numbers after peoples names meant...or was that stupid <br/>
question. So...word to the wise...cut out the Acronyms...ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is simple...this is a loose hobby with no rules or <br/>
guidelines...except to have fun...<br/>
<br/>
If one sets such stringent guidelines...that takes the fun out it and <br/>
lessens the sense of community we've developed...I enjoy reading the <br/>
posts...sometimes annoying...sometimes humourous...but all with a sense of <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
If this is what you do in your free time....get out of the house...go find <br/>
some new letterboxes...have more FUN<br/>
<br/>
Magic Mike...<br/>
<br/>
(as this is my second post in 24 hours..I'm stopping here...don't want to be <br/>
accused of being excessive.)<br/>

Subject: dartmoor letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
Hi, mapsurfer,<br/>
<br/>
Hope you don't mind the mail but I have just been looking at your fascinating<br/>
website about US letterboxing.  I didn't realise that it was stateside.  My<br/>
family and I are Dartmoor letterboxers and didn't know whether you knew (or<br/>
were interested) in the differences between our letterboxing communities. .  We<br/>
started when my eldest was about 4 and the baby of the family went when she was<br/>
a couple of months old.  We moved last year and our new house has great views<br/>
to the moor.  We have put out a box called Dalmation on the Moor.  I have<br/>
noticed that the way we name our boxes is different to you for a lot of us. <br/>
Some people seem to use a similar system to US but others just think up a name<br/>
for their box that seems appropriate. <br/>
<br/>
 I think our clues are completely different to you.  Ours sometimes contain an<br/>
Ordance Survey Map grid reference (but sometimes not - we have yet to master<br/>
these clues!) and a short clue.  Ours is:-<br/>
grid reference 72  77<br/>
<br/>
Clue     -           SW slopes of Chinkwell Tor, on outcrop.Church 222<br/>
degrees,  Highest point of Bonehill    <br/>
                         Rocks 155 degrees.  Box is under flattish rock   5'on <br/>
45degrees   from mossy boulder<br/>
                        on top of outcrop.<br/>
<br/>
Some boxes have clues similar to this (or less info) and no grid reference.  As<br/>
I said we haven't got to grips with these yet!<br/>
<br/>
The children love letterboxing, it's great exercise (although our youngest fell<br/>
into a gorse bush on Sunday and didn't like that very much)and cheap (with 3 we<br/>
have to think about that)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this is of interest to you and if not I am sorry to have troubled you. <br/>
There are other things but  I won't go into that now in case you're not<br/>
interested.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">News flash: CT.to UTAH ended up crashing a mini gather today in<br/>
Mansfield CT. held for the folks who have 'hit' F.500.  The pending<br/>
storm for tomorrow brought out the 'Utah" crowd today and we combined<br/>
both gathers.   A cold and windy parking lot gather did little to<br/>
hamper the fun.  Folks ran from car to car and everyone stamped into<br/>
the boxes that I am taking to Utah.  We are sending off lots of<br/>
exciting boxes for you 'Rocky Mt. folks to enjoy.  Most will stay in<br/>
the Salt Lake City area but we invite letterboxer to take some of them<br/>
home to plant in other places<br/>
Contack me or Cadenza off line if you would like a box from CT. to<br/>
plant.  <br/>
All of these boxes contain hand carved stamps and now hold the<br/>
personal stmps and a message from all that were present today [14 folks ]<br/>
Looking to meet some of you westerns just aftr the New Year.<br/>

The 'winged one'  [as Mark calls me !] is back home in Ct , safe and<br/>
sound with head and heart full from the whirl wind trip to Utah. So<br/>
Many memories spin their magic and I must stop and process before I<br/>
post the clues to two boxes that my grandson and I planted. To all the<br/>
CT. friends who carved and created boxes to send with me,  I give my<br/>
personal thanks once again. The Joy and excitement on faces as we met<br/>
was the greatest gift to me. I have a gift from Sam I Am to share with<br/>
you, before it 'turns' into a H.H. and takes off.  Such a surprise<br/>
when she pulled out a fresh carved stamp as our MD airport gather got<br/>
under way and called it "The NOt So Lonely Letterbox." . I was so<br/>
worried about the four hour layover, and was so entertained by the<br/>
three wonderful letterboxers that showed up, that I had to rush back<br/>
to get the plane to Utah.!<br/>
Yo, snowy Utah, I will get those boxes posted soon. Such a beautiful<br/>
place,and so many places to plant !!! I will be back.<br/>

Subject: missing letterbox<br/>
<br/>
I need to let someone know that the "Tail of the Dragon" box in NC is<br/>
missing. I went there today and searched, found the niche in the wall<br/>
but it was empty. I searched all along the wall to make sure I hadn't<br/>
missed it and even searched the opposite wall. I also searched in the<br/>
weeds hoping to find a portion of the box but with no luck.<br/>
<br/>
Can you help me notify the correct person(s)? I am brand new to<br/>
this..the tail of the dragon would have been only my second box.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

Hello! I discovered letterboxing on Monday, when I stumbled across a box by<br/>
accident. I guess it wasn't very well hidden, since someone like me, outside<br/>
the loop, found it. But I was lucky anyway, since it lead me to<br/>
www.letterboxing.org and a whole new hobby!<br/>
<br/>
On Wednesday morning I sought out my first letterbox legitamately, and also<br/>
made and stashed two new ones of my own (Sycamore Grove boxes #1 and #2). I was<br/>
too eager to wait until I handmade stamps for them, so I put store-bought ones<br/>
inside. But when I got home, I carved up a stamp of my own.<br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of stress and a lot of free time on my hands, so letterboxing is<br/>
PERFECT for me. Today I went to San Francisco to search for "The Ringmaster's<br/>
Secret." I was crushed when, after BARTing in for an hour, walking for 45<br/>
minutes, waiting another 10 or so for the coast to clear, I checked the spot<br/>
where the box was supposed to be, and there was nothing. When I got home, I<br/>
went to www.letterboxing.org to see if I could notify the placer, Amanda, to<br/>
tell her the box was missing. But there's no e-mail link on the clue page. How<br/>
can I contact her?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a million!<br/>

Subject: found letterbox<br/>
<br/>
I was geocaching and came across a film canister with "quarry" labeled onto <br/>
it.  The contents referred me to [letterboxing.org] and described the <br/>
letterbox as "quarry."  There was one stamped entry.  I could not locate <br/>
the placer of the LB to let them know the canister was just sitting in the <br/>
grass area.  Can you help me find the placer?<br/>

Well...it's saying something about "mime format". I don't even know what that is! Maybe it's my end. It shows unknown sender, and unknown subject and then all this other gobbledy gook! Maybe it is yahoo! Ugh! &gt;:{  Hopefully it will fix itself! ;)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Dear Beloved in Christ,<br/>
<br/>
It is by the grace of God that I received<br/>
Christ,knowing the truth and <br/>
the truth have set me free.Having known the truth, I<br/>
had no choice than <br/>
to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for<br/>
eternal life and <br/>
in the sight of man for witness of Gods mercy and<br/>
glory upon my life.<br/>
I have the pleasure to share my testimony with<br/>
you,having seen your <br/>
contact from the Internet. I am BARRISTER MIKE ADE,the<br/>
legal adviser to <br/>
late Mr. and Mrs. Bright Williams,a British couple<br/>
that lived in my <br/>
Country Nigeria for 25 years before they both died in<br/>
a plane crash <br/>
late last year. These couple were good Christians,<br/>
they were so <br/>
dedicated to God but they had no child till they died.<br/>
Throughout their <br/>
stay in my country, they acquired a lot of properties<br/>
like lands, house <br/>
properties, etc.<br/>
<br/>
As their legal adviser, before their death, the<br/>
husband Mr. Bright <br/>
Williams instructed me to write his WILL. Because they<br/>
had no child, <br/>
they dedicated their wealth to God. According to the<br/>
WILL, the <br/>
properties have to be sold and the money be given out<br/>
to a ministry for <br/>
the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the<br/>
documents for the <br/>
properties were in my care.<br/>
<br/>
He gave me the authority to sell the properties and<br/>
give out the fund <br/>
to the Ministries for the work of God.<br/>
<br/>
To cut the story short, I sold all the properties<br/>
after their death, as <br/>
instructed by my client,Mr. Bright Williams before his<br/>
death.<br/>
And as matter of fact, after I sold all their<br/>
properties,expectedly, I <br/>
realized a huge amount of money that runs into<br/>
millions of dollars,and <br/>
what supposed to be the percentage interest of my<br/>
right legal fee was <br/>
firstly deducted by me out of the total amount<br/>
realized from the sold <br/>
properties, this was based on the initial agreement<br/>
between me and the<br/>
owner of the properties before his death. <br/>
<br/>
Therefore,the total amount left to be invested into<br/>
God's work as <br/>
instructed by the owner is $20,000,000.00 (twenty<br/>
million US dollars) <br/>
only. But Instead of giving the main fund out for the<br/>
work of God as <br/>
instructed to me by my client before his death.<br/>
<br/>
I converted the fund to myself with the intention of<br/>
investing the fund <br/>
abroad for my personal use. I was afraid of putting<br/>
the fund in the <br/>
Bank, because I have to give account to the bank on<br/>
how got the money. <br/>
I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited<br/>
the consignments <br/>
with a security company. I did not want the management<br/>
of the Security <br/>
Company to know the content of the consignments,<br/>
therefore I registered <br/>
the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the<br/>
security company <br/>
believes that what I deposited with them was Gold<br/>
Bars. <br/>
<br/>
I had encounter with Christ when Pastor Benny Hinn was<br/>
preaching on <br/>
television concerning Ananias and Saphira in Acts<br/>
5:1-11. After hearing <br/>
the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and became a<br/>
born again <br/>
Christian.<br/>
<br/>
As a born again Christian, I started reading my bible<br/>
and one day, the <br/>
Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19. From the<br/>
scripture, I <br/>
discovered that the only way I could have peace in my<br/>
life is to do <br/>
what is lawful and right by giving out the fund as<br/>
instructed for the <br/>
work of God by my client.<br/>
<br/>
I have asked God for forgiveness on my initial thought<br/>
concerning the <br/>
money,and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have<br/>
to do what is <br/>
lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the<br/>
fund to the <br/>
chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as<br/>
instructed by my <br/>
client before his death.<br/>
<br/>
After my fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his<br/>
choice and direct <br/>
me to a honest Christian or the chosen ministry that<br/>
deserves this fund <br/>
by his Grace.<br/>
<br/>
I then came across your address on the Internet as I<br/>
was browsing <br/>
through a Christian site, and as a matter of fact, it<br/>
is not only you <br/>
or your ministry that I picked on the Christian site<br/>
initially, but <br/>
after my fervent prayer over it, then you were<br/>
nominated through divine <br/>
revelation from God, so that was  how I received such<br/>
a divine <br/>
revelation from the Lord, how I got your contact<br/>
information, and I <br/>
then decided to contact you for the fund to be used<br/>
wisely for things <br/>
that will glorify the name of God.<br/>
<br/>
I have notified the Security Company where I deposited<br/>
the consignments <br/>
that contained the fund, that I am moving the<br/>
consignment abroad and <br/>
the security company has since been waiting for my<br/>
authority for the <br/>
consignment to leave my country and be moved abroad.<br/>
So if you know <br/>
that you will use this fund honestly and wisely for<br/>
things that will <br/>
glorify God's name,then do contact me back,ASAP.Then<br/>
you send to me in <br/>
your reply,YOUR FULL NAMES,YOUR PERSONAL ADDRESS,YOUR<br/>
TELEPHONE AND FAX <br/>
NUMBERS.These informations are required by the seurity<br/>
company to<br/>
facilitate the  process  of the funds receiver's<br/>
documentation<br/>
Your prompt response will be highly appreciated in my<br/>
private email <br/>
adress(mrmikeade@netscape.net) <br/>
God bless you.<br/>
Yours in Christ.<br/>

We are the Petersen Pack from Tooele, UT.  I just found letterboxing from FamilyFun.  I introduced it to my family and we are going to start this weekend.  My kids are 9, 7, 4, and 2.  They are way stoked to try this new activity.  We will now make it part of our vacations.  I am wondering if there are any letterboxing groups in Utah.  <br/>

Looking forward to this new adventure.<br/>

We have been to Arcadia previously, before we knew about letterboxing. WE even got to do some along I95 in Ct. and in New York City and in Stiribridge, Mass.  So keep your letterbox stuff in your car and always have clues available when you go traveling. You can always check the local library where you are visiting for clues.. <br/>

I don't have any objection to a small group of people trying to keep <br/>
things the same, and perhaps you can on a small scale. There will always <br/>
be boxes that are long hikes for one box, mysteries that get solved only <br/>
infrequently, and wonderfully complex clues that you have to work hard <br/>
for. However, there are also going to be lots of other, newer, different <br/>
boxes that people will enjoy as much as you enjoy the old-fashioned <br/>
kinds of boxes. It will never be like it was completely.<br/>
<br/>
However, this endless haranguing is just tiresome.<br/>
<br/>
I planted two boxes today. Yesterday we solved a great mystery, which <br/>
was a long hike for one box, and got two drivebys, also fun.<br/>
Let's all just enjoy things our own way, and do the best we can to get <br/>
along.<br/>

And you never know which newbies just might progress into seasoned <br/>

puzzling clues, just enough to make you think and have a challenge!<br/>

&gt; why do we keep having to talk about this?<br/>
&gt; I don't care if you don't list your boxes, don't count your boxes, <br/>
don't <br/>
&gt; do anything to any boxes anywhere. I am, however, a little tired <br/>
of the <br/>

&gt; &gt; Bad analogy David because you're not taking it far enough. I <br/>
can't say<br/>
&gt; &gt; whether you're part of the problem or not. I've never <br/>
letterboxed with you,<br/>
&gt; &gt; so how would I know? I've come directly behind some <br/>
pretty "seasoned"<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxers in this area, and have found some of the more <br/>
seasoned folks to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be no more respectful than some of the new boxers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You might have felt I was talking about you specifically being a <br/>
bad boxer<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I mentioned that Phyto might not miss having your stamp <br/>
in their box<br/>
&gt; &gt; logbooks and that, by that, I was saying you were a boxer who was<br/>
&gt; &gt; disrespectful of boxes when out in the field. Nope. But first <br/>
let's take<br/>

<br/>
  I'm sorry I missed much of the earlier stuff when I started 'boxing a few years ago.  I got into it gradually, reading everything I could before doing something so I wouldn't be one of those people too lazy to read the FAQ.<br/>
<br/>
  And now I'm sad.  I wish I'd been on this list back when the cryptic clues floated around and there were so many more mysteries to solve.  They'd be great to see more of now, for those of us who DO like to read before we act and want to know how to make these very mysterious clues as good as they can be.<br/>
<br/>
  There are a few boxes with very tough clues I've been "working on" for some time now.  I haven't found a lot of them, and have tried even fewer due to distance.  It'd be nice if there were more of those right in this area, because one can only try them so many times without spending too much on gas to get there.  Still, some of those "failures" have been GREAT experiences.<br/>
<br/>
  So...show us how it's done.  Plant and be mysterious and be GLORIOUS!  Let us see more of it, and try it ourselves, and everybody can benefit.  I want to go on these mysterious hunts where so much of it is reading old literature or researching strange terms or...even learning a new language!  Give us more of these boxes that take months to solve, and maybe more of us will decide we like them.<br/>
<br/>
  There'll always be drive-bys, and they'll always serve a purpose.  But ignore the chatter and spend the time making those clues that make us so excited we think we're going to explode because we're just so proud we got some reference to some obscure poem!<br/>

&gt;  I find the above statement to be both short-sighted and narrow<br/>
&gt; minded. How would anybody who hasn't been around for awhile to observe<br/>
&gt; the evolution of letterboxing know what direction the game was<br/>
&gt; heading?  Phyto is just trying to bring back some of the old mischief<br/>
&gt; and mystery involved in the game. Her being willing to take the time<br/>
&gt; to hide not only her boxes but her clues as well, is an extra step for<br/>
&gt; her that should be appreciated for what it is, clever and imaginative.<br/>
<br/>
As a *very* newcomer to the game, I have to ask, if this isn't an <br/>
intrinsically Internet driven game, how and where does one find clues ? Are <br/>
they hidden in newspaper classifieds ?  Should one expect to find clues to <br/>
placer A's boxes in placer B's boxes ?  <br/>
<br/>
Seriously, I find this whole argument impenetrable.  I simply can't imagine <br/>
how this could work, absent the Internet.  I suspect that I would be deeply <br/>
appreciative of what you are talking about if I had any notion of what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I got here through Geocaching, which I'm assuming is seen among the <br/>
letterboxing folk as a poor relation, and frankly, I agree that it lacks much <br/>
of the romance.  But I'm missing a crucial element.  <br/>
<br/>
Where does one look for "hidden clues" ?  Does Phyto expect us to look into <br/>
great literature, the public registry of deeds, the Yellowpages ?  I just <br/>
don't get it !<br/>
<br/>
I would greatly appreciate it if someone could step back from this and provide <br/>
a hint.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For the record... I don't think of these folks as anything other than what they are... people who choose to play the letterboxing game differently than the way I play it.  I have no problem with them posting to the list that they choose to play the game this way, either, or their reaons to do so, this is their choice.  May I emphasize the word "choice"?  It seems that this game we call "letterboxing" is all about choices, there are so many choices available on how to play, that there should be a "choice" on each variation that suits each individual.  <br/>
<br/>
What irks me is when the tone of the post where they have indicated their choice of how to play makes me feel that they are condemning me in their mind; when their choice of words clearly indicates that if I continue to play the game the way I choose to play it, rather than the way they choose to play it, then I am not a "real letterboxer" to them.<br/>
<br/>
I plant.  I find.  I go to such gatherings I can get to... in light of my financial circumstances.  I hike to the limits of my physical condition, and I take my mother and my daughter with me.  We enjoy nature, and one another's company.  I rely heavily on the use of those two major websites for clues, and for social interaction with other letterboxers.  I am hosting a gathering next summer.  I post clues to my boxes on both of those major websites, so that my boxes are available to the greater number of boxers in my area...of which there are not many.  <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the game is different in the eastern US, where, from all descriptions, one can hardly walk behing a tree without tripping over boxes.  There are not so many bosers here, nor boxes, but we are working on it.  <br/>
<br/>
Phyto, please feel free to play the way you choose to play, I do not think you mean, curmudgeonly, or stingy with your clues.  Both of the major websites have had growing pains recently, and doubtless your generous contribution to their smooth running by removing your clues and yourself from them is greatly appreciated by the webmasters. (&lt;--that was a joke)  Please, don't tell me that you don't regard me as a "real letterboxer" and make clear that you despise me for the way I choose to play.  Neither of us play the game wrong, only differently.<br/>

So before you label these folks who are trying out alternate ways of <br/>
clue distribution as exclusionary or curmudgeons, take a minute to <br/>
read what it is they are actually saying rather than jumping to <br/>
conclusions and criticizing them based on your perceived ideas and <br/>
stereotypes.<br/>
