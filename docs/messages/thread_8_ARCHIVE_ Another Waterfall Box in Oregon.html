Dear Noble Letterboxers,<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to announce that I have placed the fourth in my series of<br/>
letterboxes dedicated to the spectacular waterfalls of the Columbia River<br/>
Gorge in Oregon.  The hike to the "Wahkeena Falls Letterbox" is uphill, but<br/>
not all that far, and the scenery is BREATHTAKING!!!<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, the clues can be found exclusively on the "Letterbox USA" website.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf<br/>
<br/>
While I was out and about, I checked on my other three waterfall boxes.  They<br/>
were all intact and just as I'd left them, though, to my joy and amazement,<br/>
two of them had been found!!!<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations to Steve and Jean Beuerman who were the first people to locate<br/>
the "Horsetail Falls" letterbox, as well as the "Ponytail Falls" box!!!  I<br/>
hope their interest in the hobby continues, and we hear from them on this list<br/>
(also available at the above website address) in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
My buddy Thom Cheney had best get his butt (and his compass) out there if he<br/>
wants to be first to find the "Multnomah Falls" box and the new "Wahkeena<br/>
Falls" one!!!!   ;o)<br/>
<br/>
The reason for visiting all my boxes was twofold.  First of all, I just wanted<br/>
to check and see that they were intact and see if anyone (like the Beuerman's)<br/>
had found them.  Secondly, though (at the urging of our British friend,<br/>
Graham, the Moorland Wizard) I wanted to go back to each location and jot a<br/>
few notes in the guestbooks.  Just a little personal greeting and some of my<br/>
thoughts about the locations I chose.  I think this will be a nice touch for<br/>
those who find them in the future.  I encourage others to add personal notes<br/>
when they place a box, or find one.  After all, that's what the "LETTER" is<br/>
for in "letterboxing".  This is a communications medium.  And a fun one, at<br/>
that!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing, Everybody.<br/>
