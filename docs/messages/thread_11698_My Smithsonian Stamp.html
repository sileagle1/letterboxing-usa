I think it should be in the castle because it is an image of something we have all used and it represents all the letterboxes that are listed on the LbNA website.

I submitted this to be added to the collection of letterboxes the Smithsonian wants to acquire, however, if there are enough people that would want it as a stamp in their own log book, you'll need to vote that this should become "The" Smithsonian letterbox that would be kept behind the front counter, just waiting for you to ask to stamp into it. <br/>
<br/>
To see the stamp image, log onto the Yahoo group letterboxing list and use the link below.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Or find your way to the files section of the site and look for the Smithsonian file. So far, mine is the only submission. <br/>
<br/>
About the stamp: It took me 4 days (whenever I had time) to carve it. I'm guessing it took about 6-7 hours total. It is carved on PZ Kut using a #1 Speedball blade only. The secret to fine detail is using a magnifying glass and getting a clear transfer to the rubber which I get using the heat transfer method.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you like it enough to vote for it!<br/>

Your stamp is really nice, you did a great job!<br/>
<br/>
Your post raises an interesting question though -- what is "original <br/>
art?"  Like you, I am no artist.  I usually start with an idea <br/>
and "rough sketch" out what I am thinking.  I then look for either a <br/>
single piece of clip art or sometimes several pieces and modify them, <br/>
cut them, combine them however necessary to get the finished design I <br/>
had in mind.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, my Big Two-Hearted River stamp depicts a fox jumping <br/>
across a river with some trees and the river fading into twin <br/>
hearts.  The fox is modified clip art; the trees are another piece of <br/>
modified clip art; the river and hearts are my own scratchings.<br/>
<br/>
So because I used clip art as the base for the fox and the trees, <br/>
this is not considered "original art?"  I understand about copyright <br/>
issues, particularly when you use a piece of clip art verbatim, but <br/>
what about clip art that has been modified in such a way that it <br/>
produces something new?<br/>
<br/>
Is this competition about stamp carving or drawing skill?  Even an <br/>
artist often paints from pictures.  <br/>
