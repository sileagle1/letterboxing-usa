enough for 4 year old kids to follow, and you could use fun foamie<br/>
stamps and non toxic ink available at the local crafts store.  This<br/>
would be a safe environment for the kids and also help to preserve<br/>
those letterboxes that had been lovingly made and planted in your<br/>
local preserve.  <br/>
<br/>
Remembering back when my son was that age, no matter how careful he<br/>
and his friends were, somehow, someway, something always ended up<br/>
broken.  It just happens with small children.  It would be a real<br/>
shame (and loss) if that handmade stamp and logbook ended up torn and<br/>
broken.<br/>

&gt; I recently learned about letterboxing and I am planning my daughter's <br/>
&gt; 4-year-old birthday party. I know of two letterboxes at our local<br/>
preserved gardens <br/>
&gt; and my husband and I would like to introduce the children to this<br/>
art. Does <br/>
&gt; anyone have any ideas or experiences they would like to share for<br/>
such a <br/>
&gt; celebration? I thought others might have done this with a group of<br/>
small children and <br/>
&gt; would have some input.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, I am not planning on having them carve personal stamps with their <br/>
&gt; parents, however, since they are only 4 and the gathering will only<br/>
be for 2 hours. <br/>
&gt; They will each receive a log book and stamp when they arrive. Please<br/>
let me <br/>
&gt; know if you have any ideas about this. Thanks,<br/>
