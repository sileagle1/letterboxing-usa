This is Ginny in Reno.  I had gone to search for the Lonely LB here in <br/>
Rancho San Rafael Park-- it was one that needed adopting-- well it was <br/>
missing.  I contacted the original placer and asked if she wanted <br/>
another box placed-- she said I could do that.<br/>
<br/>
So I put together a box-- which I call Boo Bunny-- Actually Lonely Boo <br/>
Bunny-- I am going to place it in the same spot but the rock covering <br/>
it will be different and it will be under the concrete ledge not just <br/>
under the rock.   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway-- my dilema is that I will take a new picture of the spot but I <br/>
have no idea how to change the info on your site-- could someone work <br/>
with me on this--<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Ginny <br/>
