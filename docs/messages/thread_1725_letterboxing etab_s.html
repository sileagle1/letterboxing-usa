                    <div class="plaintext-content">hi all! just a quick comment on what i call the "estimated time of <br/>
arrivel at box" or the etab. i really appreciate having a rough idea <br/>
of the time and terrain. some boxes require a day which includes <br/>
travel to,the hunt, enjoying the moment , view etc. and travel home. <br/>
others require  an hour. i can understand those who enjoy mystery but <br/>
i say a big thankyou to those who include the "etab" along with their <br/>
clues!!! joyful letterboxing to all who venture out for the hunt this <br/>
weekend!! see joy<br/>

I totally agree thanks to all of you who include the "etab". My mom<br/>
hates driving, so we try to squeeze as many boxes as we can in one day,<br/>
(this is getting easier with the help of c stearns and the days becoming<br/>
longer.) Just wanted to say I appreciate it.<br/>
