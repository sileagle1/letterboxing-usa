&gt; Hi Daniel--<br/>
&gt; ...I think the best option is for you to copy it if that's not too<br/>
&gt; much trouble for you.  (I've added another photo that had to be on &gt; another page due to the way the builder is set up.)<br/>
<br/>
Here is the direct link to your new page Julie (with both photos):<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/garland2.htm<br/>
You can also click on garland on the state of TEXAS to get there.<br/>
The original page at http://www.pclink.com/elf/garland.htm<br/>
is still there, but it is not linked to the main map right now.<br/>
I will leave it this way unless you want me to arrange the pages<br/>
differently.  At some point you may want to do that.  Just let me<br/>
know if you do.<br/>
<br/>

While I am fully aware the decision rests with Julie, AND I think it's a great idea to have the pictures pop up from the map (adds great flavor), it seems as though it's no longer possible to link to the Garland clues.  Am I missing something?<br/>

Well, I think that 3 of the 4 boxes are still missing in Garland, isn't
that right?
<br/>I think Julies solution for now is to replace the clues with this intermediate
<br/>page which basically instructs people to email her for the clues. 
I think this'
<br/>is a good stop gap, but I am always interested in exploring the ways
to
<br/>make the clues more secure so we don't have to do be limited to this
<br/>one solution.  I believe there is a way to know who accesses the
clues --
<br/>sort of like caller ID, I think -- I have to look into this.
