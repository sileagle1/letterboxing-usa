I've tried looking at all the weekends in March, and SOMEBODY is <br/>
going to miss it that would want to go, so I used the one most <br/>
convinient for myself.  =)<br/>
<br/>
As for chosing between Tacoma or Seattle, the people in Seattle <br/>
probably don't want to drive to Tacoma and anyone in Tacoma doesn't <br/>
want to drive to Seattle, so I picked a place in the southern reaches <br/>
of Seattle.  Right off of I-5.  Saturday traffic isn't THAT bad, is <br/>
it?<br/>
<br/>
You Washington people better show up, because it'll be embarrassing <br/>
if more Portland folks show up than Washingtonians!  =)<br/>
<br/>
The Paisley Orca has created a great Seattle event stamp for us.  At <br/>
least she claims it's a great stamp.  I haven't actually seen it <br/>
myself yet, but her other stamps are great works of art, so I believe <br/>
her!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow....  hope to see you all!  If you can't make it, perhaps we <br/>
can get together some other time for coffee or something.  I'd still <br/>
like to meet everyone that can't make it at the gathering!  I'll <br/>
probably be in the area for a while visiting friends and looking for <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Farewell!<br/>
