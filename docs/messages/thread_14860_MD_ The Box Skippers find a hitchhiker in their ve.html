(8/2/03 - 8/3/03) to successfully complete Mighty Mouse's Pilgrimage <br/>
(our first) battling thunderstorms, man eating gnats, and apparent <br/>
blindness. (I swear I looked in the same spot the day before and it <br/>
was not there!) <br/>
<br/>
Our initial victory was made even sweeter when we found The World's <br/>
Slowest Hitchhiker with Mighty Mouse. He made the trip to the next <br/>
box we found.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, that box would not be South Mountain Trinity #1, since we <br/>
could not find it and it seems to be widely reported as MIA..<br/>
