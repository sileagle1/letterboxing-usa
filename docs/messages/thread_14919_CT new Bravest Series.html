                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday we did Steve and Heidi's new series in Nehantic.  Great <br/>
tribute and we love hand carved stamps- Good Job,Guys!!   The "fort" <br/>
you mention in the clues looks like an old foundation of some sort- <br/>
NEAT!!!On the way out, we restamped our logbook with the Oriental <br/>
series- we found them all from memory.  We lost the original stamps <br/>
when our logbook fell in the river while we were planting our Selden <br/>
Island series back in April.(What was really a bummer, was the fact <br/>
that the book was in a back pack attached to Sunshine, so it was NOT <br/>
the only thing that went home wet that day-GRRRRR)   Anyway, we are <br/>
thrilled to have the stamps from our first ever letterboxing <br/>
experience back in our logbook-YAY!!! Thanks to ALL who plant boxes <br/>
so we can have so much fun finding them!!! Sunshine+Swamp Yankee<br/>
