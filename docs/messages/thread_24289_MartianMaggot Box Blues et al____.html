                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although no one mentioned Rick on this main list before I did, he was <br/>
mentioned on the MidAtlantic board before I commented here.  In <br/>
addition, a comment was made prior to mine on this board about how <br/>
someone should not have taken Martian Maggot's boxes without <br/>
permission. From my understanding, it was LBNA management that <br/>
granted the adoption, so if you want to question someone on the <br/>
issue, it should be them and not Rick - as he could not have adopted <br/>
them without their permission. Being that it is simple to check the <br/>
links on LBNA for the NJ boxes that Martian Maggot listed in her e-<br/>
mail and see that they were currently under Ricks' adoption (as many <br/>
pages show the words "adopted from Martian Maggot"), I decided to <br/>
post here about it.  As I said before, I am not taking sides here. I <br/>
do have an opinion about this, but I will leave it up to all of you <br/>
long timers here to argue about it, I prefer to try and see the good <br/>
in people and I like to focus on the positives in life. I can see <br/>
viewpoints from all sides including the fact that I have now spoken <br/>
in e-mail to both Rick &amp; Kimberly about this.  I certainly believe <br/>
that Rick decided to adopt the boxes and take on the responsibility <br/>
because he enjoys the hobby a great deal and wanted to see those <br/>
great boxes and locations preserved.  I also believe that Kimberly <br/>
cares alot bout her boxes even though she left the area and was <br/>
somewhat out of touch with the LBNA community.  How do you decide if <br/>
it's abandoned or not? And if it is, should it be left that way or <br/>
not?  That's a tough one.  No one likes litter, but a well placed <br/>
letterbox would probably not turn up as litter as they're hard enough <br/>
to find in the first place!  But if they did get tossed out, it all <br/>
goes back to Darwin.  Survival of the fittest.  In this case, the <br/>
fittest letterbox.  If you don't want trash, hide them better. <br/>
Although I am new to this hobby as of this past year I have put alot <br/>
of time and effort into it. I have found some boxes that Lewis &amp; <br/>
Clark would have passed right by and I have found boxes that looked <br/>
like they were planted as an afterthought. Some boxes are advertised <br/>
as "Drive By's" because they are quick to do.  But some look like <br/>
Drive-By's as in the placer "drove by" and threw the box out the <br/>
window and into a bush.  While I can appreciate an occassional quick <br/>
find after walking hours to look for another box, I'd rather have it <br/>
be a short walk that requires solving some clues rather than, "Park <br/>
in the lot by the garbage can...go 10 steps at 100 degrees and find <br/>
the box under a park bench. Be careful to rehide as you're right in <br/>
front of the steps to the county court house" which apparently the <br/>
placer choose that spot while eating his McDonalds meal on a lunch <br/>
break.  While that may be a spot for a hide-a-key rock for those who <br/>
like the urban hunt or as a challenge that some like to do in public <br/>
places, its not much of an adventure. Now don't get me wrong, I like <br/>
those but the real challenge should be to hide the mini-box in public <br/>
in a spot where it will hopefully remain hidden and not to place a <br/>
fullsize box and all the trimmings under a bench and cover it with <br/>
two leaves and a stick in the county square. But this is everyone's <br/>
hobby, so place as you will. But don't complain if the box winds it's <br/>
way to dumpsterville in the week it was placed.  And that brings me <br/>
to my point, yes there is a point here.  Martian Maggot has some <br/>
great box locations that require a lot of walking, great clues and <br/>
some great nature encounters.  To my understanding, Rick tried to <br/>
make contact and while there may or may not have been contact made <br/>
(Only those involved really know the actual extent of the contact) it <br/>
was apparently LBNA honchos who assigned the boxes to Rick.  I know <br/>
that he has put alot of time into trying to find and maintain the <br/>
boxes without any outside help.  Was it his place to take on the <br/>
boxes of someone else, whether or not they had conversatons back and <br/>
forth?  That's the question I guess -that LBNA needs to answer and <br/>
they so far have been curioulsy absent here from this discussion. So <br/>
as I said, I do have an opinion but I choose not to take sides.  From <br/>
many conversations with Rick and a few recently with Kimberly I can <br/>
say that they both seem to care about Letterboxing and all it <br/>
entails.  So, here's the only opinion I will share - let's work it <br/>
out and get back to the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
-There's not enough joy in the world nowadays, let's do something <br/>
about it.  Let's Letterbox More.   -John<br/>

&gt; Please read the posts again, no one jumped the gun. No one mentioned<br/>
&gt; Rick in Boca until Jersytrailblazer mentioned him explaining that he<br/>
&gt; wasn't privy to all the information but stated that he was aware,<br/>
&gt; through his correspondence with Rick in Boca, that he was trying to <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; helpful. Please don't turn this in to a flame as her Ladyship feels<br/>
&gt; there is an important point in all this that should be debated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When is a box abandoned and when does it become litter? Should there<br/>
&gt; be a rule about what is abandoned? How else would we decide when<br/>
&gt; enough time is enough. What would constitute abandonment, the last<br/>
&gt; time anyone heard from the placer, the last time someone found the<br/>
&gt; box, or merely the fact that a box is damaged in some way and the<br/>
&gt; placer hasn't checked on it quickly enough to find the damage before<br/>
&gt; someone else? It seems like that it would become a very slippery <br/>
slope<br/>
&gt; to try to make a rule that imposes an expiration date on a box. It <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; very likely that all letterboxers wouldn't read or accept a rule and<br/>
&gt; people inevitably will misinterpret it and next thing you know <br/>
people<br/>
&gt; are 'benevolently' adopting boxes everywhere. One mustn't forget<br/>
&gt; Samuel Johnson's maxim that "Hell is paved with good intentions."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems an inviolate truism that another persons art work is their<br/>
&gt; own and should never be tampered with in any way but this runs the<br/>
&gt; risk of abandoned letterboxes strewn all over Connecticut and the <br/>
rest<br/>
&gt; of the country becoming more and more to be viewed as litter and<br/>
&gt; giving letterboxing a bad name. We all know that letterboxes are<br/>
&gt; abandoned and one does not want to see litter filling up parks and<br/>
&gt; public lands so what does one do? How does one know when enough time<br/>
&gt; passed is enough? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Certainly Rick in Boca made an attempt to find the placer, a search <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; the archives will bring up this string if anyone bothers to check <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; we now have an angry owner. It seems there is a responsibility for a<br/>
&gt; placer to monitor their boxes in some way otherwise their <br/>
abandonment<br/>
&gt; turns their letterbox from art to litter and her Ladyship finds <br/>
litter<br/>
&gt; unacceptable. However, one wouldn't want others to determine when a<br/>
&gt; box has been abandoned because there will assuredly be disagreements<br/>
&gt; about where this line should be drawn. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What then should the answer be? In her Ladyship's pompous, elitist,<br/>
&gt; self-righteous, arrogant, nasty, egotistical, mean opinion the onus<br/>
&gt; should be on the placer and that, tempting though it may be to plant<br/>
&gt; while on vacation or leave boxes behind when one moves, a placer<br/>
&gt; should be responsible to find a foster parent for their box if it is<br/>
&gt; in an area in which they cannot quickly reach the box for <br/>
maintenance.<br/>
&gt; This is the only way to retain control over one's special creation <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; it also imposes a responsibility to maintain ones boxes and once<br/>
&gt; again, not all will read or follow this rule. Is there a reasonable<br/>
&gt; solution here?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Quizzically,<br/>
