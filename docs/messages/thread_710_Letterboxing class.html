                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few weeks ago, Mitch forwarded to me a letter from a<br/>
teacher in New Jersey who was interested in setting up<br/>
an orienteering/letterboxing event for her students. <br/>
I made a few suggestions, and I think a few of you did<br/>
too.  Here is an excerpt from a letter I just<br/>
receieved with an update on how the whole thing went:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Dear Steven,<br/>
<br/>
Well thanks to your clever idea of utilizing the 35mm<br/>
canisters the<br/>
Orienteering/Letterboxing Event was a huge success!<br/>
Thirteen parents<br/>
came to<br/>
the rescue. My first task was to give them a crash<br/>
course on compass<br/>
reading. My husband and I laid out 8 courses  in the<br/>
flat but wooded<br/>
area in<br/>
front of the school. Each couse had ten controls. Had<br/>
the students<br/>
broken<br/>
into groups of three. Each child had a base plate<br/>
style compass. (All<br/>
loaners) They were given a sheet with all compass<br/>
headings. I<br/>
unfortunately<br/>
ran out of time to incorporate any puns. I placed each<br/>
group at their<br/>
differnt start positions and then had the 13 parent<br/>
recruits help them<br/>
orient from control to control. At each stop, the kids<br/>
had to look for<br/>
the<br/>
canister,remove one sticker and stick it on the<br/>
appropiate numbered<br/>
sheet. I<br/>
used your idea of making the 10th control a "leterbox"<br/>
style stop. I<br/>
had<br/>
hidden a stamper pad and rubber stamp that they needed<br/>
to stamp<br/>
directions<br/>
sheets. The parents had a blast....if they<br/>
comprehended the crash<br/>
compass<br/>
course and the kids were bouncing off the walls. Many<br/>
thanks for your<br/>
suggestions! They definately helped to channel my<br/>
thoughts and efforts.<br/>
I'm<br/>
a firm believer in "hands-on" style of learing. It was<br/>
certainly a big<br/>
undertaking but well worth the effort. I spent many a<br/>
night walking the<br/>
dark<br/>
wooded area with a flashlight dangling out of my mouth<br/>
just ot be able<br/>
to<br/>
read the darn compass. My husband whose name is also<br/>
Stephen and I had<br/>
to be<br/>
quite a sight and the topic of much speculation.<br/>
<br/>
I had used the kid's map from the letterboxing site<br/>
and copied the<br/>
directions. After my original kid's compass class I<br/>
had them try their<br/>
hand<br/>
at finding their way through the woods. They found it<br/>
more difficult<br/>
than I<br/>
had anticipated. I groaned at the thought of what<br/>
might happen when I<br/>
got<br/>
them outdoors. As I had stated they were so interested<br/>
and amazed at<br/>
their<br/>
accomplishment of orienting around the course in<br/>
approximately 40<br/>
minutes<br/>
that they even surprised me!"<br/>

I've gotten alot of queries recently from people who say they have read<br/>
about letterboxing in "Orion Magazine".  I haven't had time to look <br/>
further, so if someone else has the time and interest, there it is.<br/>

I've tried Smithsonian as well, to no avail. Maybe someone else might<br/>
give it a try? Seems like a logical article follow-up to me.<br/>
