                    <div class="plaintext-content">Touching on the issue of pace or step...  Let me throw out the concept of <br/>
'pace count' from land navigation.  The user calibrates their pace (one pace <br/>
equals each time the same foot strikes the ground) and determines how many <br/>
paces per 100 meters.  An effective calibration method is to use a high <br/>
school 400 meter (standard 440 yard) track.  Select a starting point, and <br/>
walk once around the track counting your paces. Divide that total by 4, and <br/>
you have your 'pace count'.  Typical value is 64 paces (per 100m), but <br/>
depends on each individual.  Mechanical pedometers are not effective because <br/>
use of pace count in the field is as much art as science.  With a limited <br/>
amount of practice you develop the skill to effectively compensate for <br/>
uphill, downhill, obstacles, etc.  Thus instead of 'go 97 steps', <br/>
instructions are given as, "...go 75 meters..."  Judging by the results of <br/>
numerous students in the field, accuracy seems to reliably within 5 - 10% of <br/>
the distance traveled.  A very effective technique.<br/>
