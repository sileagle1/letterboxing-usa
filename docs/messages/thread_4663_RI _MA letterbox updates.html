<br/>
After a quick stop at the A&amp;W Rootbeer on rte 44 for some weiners and Rootbeer went off to the Scituate Reservoir to retrieve the Naked Woman in the Waterfall.  Another beautiful site to visit.  Seems that we had just missed "TNT" who had visited this site early in the day.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday saw an early easter trip to Hebert's Candy Mansion then a visit to Farmer Harvey for a little "Peace on Earth" for Dad.  I had visited him in February on another trip to the area.  Here too everything was fine.  <br/>
<br/>
It was a great weekend for letterboxing.<br/>

Thanks, Debbie, for the info.  I just checked on all my letterboxes <br/>
today and saw your stamps at "Peace on Earth".  I was *shocked* at <br/>
the visits that this letterbox has received, considering the <br/>
letterbox is less than three months old!  It was fun to sit in <br/>
the "rocketship" and read all the entries.  Our mild New England <br/>
winter must have had all the letterboxers out and about!<br/>

Of course the day I went by myself was after the one snow storm we had.  <br/>
There was the most solid sheet of ice all the way around the "Rocket" that I <br/>
wished I had brought my ice skates.  Great little spot though.<br/>
