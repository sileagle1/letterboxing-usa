<br/>
One way to do this is to use a photo hosting service like <br/>
tinypic.com. You can upload an image to their web site, and they'll <br/>
host it on their web site for you. They'll give you a link to your <br/>
image on their web site, and you can use that link to embed the image <br/>
in a web page, or just send the link to people or post it online. The <br/>
URL will have some random filename like this, though:<br/>
http://i3.tinypic.com/xfe2bn.jpg<br/>
<br/>
It's pretty sweet -- a free service that will save you from mountains <br/>
of heart-breaking work that you might otherwise have to do to build <br/>
your own web site....<br/>

If you don't have your own website, I second Silent Doug's idea for the photo hosting service.  In our case, we just loaded the photos to our GeoCities site, which is probably a slight bit more complicated, but works basically the same way.   Anyway, this is all possible due to the website enhancements (a while back) that allow everyone to include HTML tags in our clues... a great feature!  Thanks to whoever did that!<br/>

<br/>
One way to do this is to use a photo hosting service like <br/>
tinypic.com. You can upload an image to their web site, and they'll <br/>
host it on their web site for you. They'll give you a link to your <br/>
image on their web site, and you can use that link to embed the image <br/>
in a web page, or just send the link to people or post it online. The <br/>
URL will have some random filename like this, though:<br/>
http://i3.tinypic.com/xfe2bn.jpg<br/>
<br/>
It's pretty sweet -- a free service that will save you from mountains <br/>
of heart-breaking work that you might otherwise have to do to build <br/>
your own web site....<br/>
