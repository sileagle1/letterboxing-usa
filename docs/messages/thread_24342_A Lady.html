Mountain Scorpia. She claims to be a lady all right;<br/>
that is if you dont get her undies in a bunch. Can<br/>
you really trust a lady that has "Scorpia" in her<br/>
name? Come on now! Not to mention a dog that will take<br/>
off a naked man's gonads. <br/>
<br/>
She can fool you all right. There was that heckling<br/>
issue, way back when. Something about etiquette,<br/>
wasnt it?<br/>
<br/>
Hear she care takes Max Patch now. Although I will be<br/>
the first to admit that this is a good deed, I am a<br/>
bit worried that she might not remember to put the<br/>
stamp back in the box. Is that the problem, Mountain<br/>
Scorpia? Did you forget where you hid the Store of<br/>
Good Manners?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can get that dog to track it down for you. <br/>
Do we know this lady for what she really is?<br/>

<br/>
  (I beg your pardon, but prefacing your name with Dear, even if that is the proper salutation for a business letter, seems to me a bit premature, especially since you are not only premature in your judgment of my character, but also presumptuous and un- or mis-informed.)<br/>
<br/>
  Your implication, and other posts like it, are the reason I rarely read the LbNA talklist anymore.  Just my luck, the one day I decide to read instead of delete, this is what I get.the usual drivel and/or flaming, this time disguised as legitimate boxing business.<br/>
<br/>
  Times must really be slow at the ALPI  for you to stoop so low as to start picking on little old ladies.<br/>
<br/>
  But I digress.  First of all, I have never claimed to be a lady.  Please reveal your source of that bit of nonsense, if you can!  The word is best used when couched in the middle of a particularly randy yet well-versed and highbrow joke.   I find the term not only antiquated  not that that is a bad thing, considering my advanced years  but often demeaning, especially when used by a certain type of male found trolling the dating sites on the Internet and the personal classifieds for a woman who is stupid enough to think that his use of the term means he will surely treat her with the same respect and consideration whether they are out on the town or she is looking at yet another pair of dirty socks tossed on the recliner like a modern-day antimacassar while his contribution to housework is keeping the buttons on the television remote well polished.  Oh my.as my estrogen levels drop, so do my inhibitions.  Enough of that; where was I?<br/>
<br/>
  Ah yes, the attacks on my character.  If it werent for the smarmy tone of your post, Mr. Bacon, I would be flattered that anyone would think I was in possession of the Store of Good Manners, since it appears there are so few of us still willing to use them in the face of so much obstreperousness and dead-horse-beating on this talklist.<br/>
<br/>
  You may recall, Mr. Bacon, my extreme good judgment  and practicing what I preach  the last time I tried to defend on this list one of the few carved-in-stone tenets of letterboxing.the caveat that one must not disturb the Earth.  Yes, when I gently reminded a talklister that digging is possibly the Number One Boxing No-No.  Perhaps she was actually one of your ladies, because she protested that she was merely scooping, something perhaps ladies call it instead of digging, which is what it is regardless of what she chose to call it.  If I may quote from my Websters New International Unabridged Dictionary, a lovely volume with marbled page edges and those marvelous finger scoops (tee hee) for each letter of the alphabet:<br/>
<br/>
  scoop, v;   [other definitions omitted to save space]<br/>
  2b  to make hollow, as a scoop or dish; to excavate; to dig out  (emphasis mine)<br/>
<br/>
  I rest my case.<br/>
<br/>
  Addressing another point of contention, to my knowledge I have only forgotten to replace a stamp one time  in Montana  and I immediately walked 4 miles out of my way to find a library with internet access so I could contact the placer and mail it to him.<br/>
<br/>
  Last but not least, there is the incident of the dog.  You refer of course to Baguette La Coquette, who accompanied me on many volksmarches and boxing adventures.  She was only doing what she knew best  alerting me to hazards ahead on the trail.  This particular time, it was a naked man whose business, apparently, was to hide just far enough inside the scrub of the Ocala National Forests St. Francis Loop to accommodate thrill-seekers who prefer mating amongst ticks, chiggers, and snakes, yet elude the scrutiny of the Forest Service rangers or the Volusia County Sheriff.<br/>
<br/>
  Mr. Bacon, I forgive you for your faux pas, as you could not know, but this wonderful canine companion has crossed the Rainbow Bridge.  And she would likewise forgive me, I am sure, for using this opportunity to plug my June event, the Southern Highlands Gathering.  Your recollection of the origin of the Nekkid Redneck box (long flooded away, by now) brought tears to my eyes, but also inspired me to add to my Songcatcher Box Series:  My Dear Companion (Oh have you seen my dear companion, for she was all this world to me.)  Perhaps I may call upon KnitWit to play it on her mountain dulcimer at the musicale following the days boxing.<br/>
<br/>
  Speaking of calling upon supportive friends, I must do so now, at grave risk to his own reputation.  You see, Gallant Rogue and I  both happy in our respective domestic relationships  have been carrying on a bit off-list.  I must say that he is true to his name: although he takes his clever flirtations to the very edge of propriety (as a rogue must), he has remained gallant in respect to his monogamous nature, thus preserving marital harmony.   GR, please show this gentleman and his rapt audience how very wrong he is about me.  I rely on your usual brilliant combination of discretion and frankness.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Madam Scorpia I am honored to come to your aid! I apologize for<br/>
taking so long to respond as I was accompanying several other fair<br/>
maidens on a Castle Quest Lady Judith of "Judith &amp; Sparky", Lady <br/>
Irene of "Hikers &amp; Hounds" and Queen Judy of "Sewsowbizzy". We were <br/>
having a merry time in Fairfax. Of course we replaced all the stamps <br/>
and tread lightly upon Mother Nature.<br/>
<br/>
The number one (1) thing that comes to my mind is how you (Mountain<br/>
Scorpia) attempted a friendly mentoring in best environmental<br/>
practices for which you got slightly flame broiled by those who<br/>
didn't appreciate your admirable ethics. Yes we have been<br/>
corresponding since that incident. You ever so politely and "lady<br/>
like" gently advocated a very reasonable "leave no trace<br/>
(http://www.lnt.org/ ) respect the environment" policy when hiding<br/>
a letterbox., Wouldn't you think respect for the environment to be<br/>
universally accepted by all letterboxers? I was somewhat shocked and<br/>
saddened to see you of all people flamed! I have tried to remain<br/>
silent in such goings ons hereabouts but I'm slightly ashamed I<br/>
didn't gallantly speak up at the time but I won't stand by and see<br/>
you flamed again without aiding your defense . Mr. Bacon I<br/>
recently conducted a survey 154 letterboxers agreed Good hiding<br/>
spots are found not made. Altering a site is not necessary..<br/>
Mountain Scorpia is a conscientious letterboxer who has made valuable<br/>
contribution to the community by building awareness, appreciation and<br/>
respect for our forests.<br/>
<br/>
Now I must go remove yet another pair of dirty socks tossed on the<br/>
recliner and settle down to a cold English Ale while keeping the<br/>
buttons on the television remote well polished.<br/>
<br/>
I remain your humble servant!<br/>
