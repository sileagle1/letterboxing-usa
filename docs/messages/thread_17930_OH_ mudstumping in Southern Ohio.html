                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a fabulous time in Cincy.  Short as it was, we were able to <br/>
find 7 out of 14 boxes that we went after.  Several were definately <br/>
missing others may have misled us due to the amount of orienteering <br/>
involved and time we did not have.  We had lots of fun and Sunday was <br/>
a beautiful day.  <br/>
<br/>
Our successes included:<br/>
Lake Isabella<br/>
Sleepy Hollow<br/>
Coffee Break<br/>
IScream<br/>
Somethin' Fishy<br/>
Mirror Lake<br/>
and <br/>
Union Terminal<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you all for the fun and adventurous way to go site-seeing!<br/>
I went to lots of places that I haven't seen since living there! When <br/>
visiting family in the past, it was just visiting, eating and riding <br/>
roller coasters! <br/>
<br/>
We were able to leave 2 goodies behind.  And will be releasing a <br/>
hitchhiker that we were unable to place.<br/>
<br/>
Clues will be posed soon.<br/>
