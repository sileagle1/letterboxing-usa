&gt; Webmasters. I have now posted all of the Bike It or Hike It <br/>
&gt; Letterboxes, from all states, over to the new site. The only issue <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; in NJ, where I posted my D &amp; R Canal box and now see that you <br/>
already <br/>
&gt; posted it. You can take out the old post labeled D &amp; R Canal.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the very easy new posting method.<br/>
