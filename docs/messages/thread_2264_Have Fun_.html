flurry of new boxes in honor so you have plenty to do. It will keep <br/>
the area momentum building. Our winter gathering surely seemed to do <br/>
that. <br/>
     Anyone else watching the count of talk list members grow. We <br/>
hoverd in the 190's all winter and it grows all the time now at 212 <br/>
today! Welcome to all the new found friends. <br/>
     Off to Cape Cod for  mini reunion from my high school friends <br/>
look for the Reunion Letterbox on my return. 2 For the Road on Cape <br/>
Cod has already had some visitors thanks. Happy Letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
P.S. the otter box will hopefully go to its new home on Sunday, been <br/>
way to busy lately.     Carol- in can't have been 25 years<br/>
