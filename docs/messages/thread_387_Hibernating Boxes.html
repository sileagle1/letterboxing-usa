                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday it was crystal clear here in central Vermont, with <br/>
nighttime temperatures down to 20 and daytime in the 50's. There are <br/>
still two feet of snow on our lawn, but that won't last long!<br/>
<br/>
My son Peter and I set out for a hike around Braintree along the back <br/>
roads. People were collecting and boiling sap everywhere. We walked <br/>
about 8 miles and ended up at the Braintree Meetinghouse for a picnic <br/>
lunch. The panther had emerged from the snow and was warming herself <br/>
and her two cubs in the sun. We could see Mt. Moosilauke and Mt. <br/>
Lafayette over in New Hampshire.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch I walked across the snow to the site of the Panther <br/>
letterbox. The snow level at that point was below the location of the <br/>
box, and I pulled it out. It's a little Tupperware-like plastic box, <br/>
with a somewhat loose-fitting snap-on lid. Items inside are in <br/>
ziplock bags.<br/>
<br/>
I was delighted to find that after four months of hibernation, mostly <br/>
covered with snow but with several thaws and rains, the box was <br/>
completely dry and its contents unmarked.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the season is turning, I hope that there will be some marks <br/>
soon - in the journal! Erik and Susan have been over this way, but <br/>
I'm hoping there are some other folks not too far from Braintree - <br/>
maybe some who have signed on over the winter. The other Braintree <br/>
letterboxes should be emerging from the snow in a week or two, and <br/>
I'll post a brief note when that happens. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I am planning to get over soon to NH to look for <br/>
Danielle's, and down to Mass to search out that wonderfully cached <br/>
Woods Hole box (as well as the other one of Bonnie's I couldn't find <br/>
last fall.) Could you New Englanders let me know if/when your boxes <br/>
are ready for spring searchers?<br/>
<br/>
Good Hunting All!<br/>
