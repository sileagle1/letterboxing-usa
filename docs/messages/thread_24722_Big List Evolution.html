rules and regulations to arts and crafts.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I preach the merits of circular knitting needles over straights and I<br/>
prefer knit over crochet most any day, but I don't insist its the only way<br/>
or put down people who don't do it my way.  You also don't see people<br/>
flaming over it.  And you can't take arts and crafts too seriously.  You<br/>
can, but then you'll be a hoity toity artist who wouldn't go near the free<br/>
flowing love of a place such as craftster.org and you'd miss out on some fun<br/>
times and great people.<br/>

There was something else you brought up here but I can't remember what it<br/>
was now.  But basically my point is: Life is a joke, so make fun of it.<br/>
Have fun with everything in life, including letterboxing.  Don't go out of<br/>
your way to piss anyone off and we should all be fine.<br/>

&gt; A few observations, FWIW. JMHO, YMMV, ADA :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I only saw one message in this thread that I considered<br/>
&gt; downright nasty and wish hadn't been posted. Perhaps I'm<br/>
&gt; not as sensitive as others, and w.r.t. to that message,<br/>
&gt; perhaps more sensitive than others. Some of the rest of<br/>
&gt; it seems like good clean fun to me, but WDIK? It all<br/>
&gt; seems so Seinfeldish to me, and I'll admit to laughing<br/>
&gt; hysterically at some points (and not necessarily at<br/>
&gt; the idea).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think some people take themselves, this list, this game,<br/>
&gt; etc., way too seriously. That won't change, unfortunately.<br/>
&gt; mapsurferspeak has absolutely no purpose other than to<br/>
&gt; highlight this fact and deflect the brewing storm, but that<br/>
&gt; never works either. It is best just to remain silent<br/>
&gt; and let it pass, tho occasionally it can lead to entertainment<br/>
&gt; value.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I lurk on other letterboxing fora. The alleged wide<br/>
&gt; disparity between niceness there and nastiness here, at<br/>
&gt; least in some cases, is a myth, IMHO. There is some<br/>
&gt; disparity, but it isn't as wide as asserted (although<br/>
&gt; I do not lurk on Silver Eagle's list, perhaps there it<br/>
&gt; is). One such forum that was claimed to be flame free<br/>
&gt; has been as bad over the period that I began lurking<br/>
&gt; than this list (which hasn't really been bad lately;<br/>
&gt; neither were all that bad). Historically, however,<br/>
&gt; this list is pretty bad, probably the worst. Must<br/>
&gt; be the moderator. But there are flames everywhere, and<br/>
&gt; generally for the same stupid sorts of reasons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In general, nastiness is proportional to population.<br/>
&gt; That's not controversial, it just is. Not much to say<br/>
&gt; about, really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In some ways, I think this list long ago outlived its<br/>
&gt; usefulness. It is too big to be the "community" it wanted<br/>
&gt; to be in the olden days, and there is only so many times you<br/>
&gt; can ask about this or that that isn't covered in 50 billion<br/>
&gt; faqs 50 billion ways from Sunday (IMHO, there is way to much<br/>
&gt; chitchat, faq writing, attempted rule making/boundary drawing<br/>
&gt; in these documents, but that is a topic for another time).<br/>
&gt; So, you get threads on shirt boxing and hypodermic needles,<br/>
&gt; (and of course, semiotics, for where else is one to post<br/>
&gt; such? -- its not in the faq's I've seen). So, what do<br/>
&gt; you expect? Add to the fact that too many people on it<br/>
&gt; are hyper-sensitive and take themselves and the game way<br/>
&gt; too seriously, and it is not a recipe for a pleasant forum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its charter is as forum strictly independent of any website.<br/>
&gt; Does that have value? -- I dunno. Its nice when a website<br/>
&gt; operator can post operational issues in a wide letterboxing<br/>
&gt; forum when they cannot do so on their website, but this use is<br/>
&gt; rare; FAIK, they have their own ways of doing that. OTOH, it<br/>
&gt; is annoying when 10 people chime in that this site or that<br/>
&gt; site is down or back up -- anyone with a browser can quickly<br/>
&gt; determine that for themselves. It is also nice to be able to<br/>
&gt; discuss this website or that website's operational or other<br/>
&gt; policies without fear of censorship from that website's<br/>
&gt; operator. Does that have value? I dunno -- in the abstract<br/>
&gt; yes, but for all practical purposes, probably not. I mean,<br/>
&gt; this is letterboxing after all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Its value, as a serious forum, would be to discuss issues that<br/>
&gt; affect letterboxing nationally. But, for all I know, there<br/>
&gt; are already 10 different fora that do a better job at that.<br/>
&gt; I think it has a value as a forum to goof around in and hide<br/>
&gt; clues, but the historical hyper-sensitivity and insensitivity<br/>
&gt; to harf and irony can make that near impossible sometimes,<br/>
&gt; forgetting the fact that people who look for clues outside<br/>
&gt; of traditional distribution channels are few and far between.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We could vote on shutting it down. I think that would be a cool<br/>
&gt; vote. Otherwise, it is what it is, warts and all -- and that is<br/>
&gt; not much more that a historical artefact of letterboxing in<br/>
&gt; North America. People are free to evolve it as they choose, tho,<br/>
&gt; including voting it out of existence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
