                    <div class="plaintext-content">FINALLY! We nailed this one, too, Jay. We found the exact spot this summer<br/>
on our first try, but... no box!  (I can brag better than you can! ;-p )  We<br/>
went back and looked again when we heard that someone else had found it just<br/>
a couple of weeks before we tried.  Then Pete and Wanda found the missing<br/>
box had been tossed into the woods and replaced it.  Thankx, Pete and Wanda!<br/>
This was a really fun mystery box, and worth bragging about.  I'll glue the<br/>
Diploma in our book.  I wonder what the stamp *says*...    :-)  I gotta redo<br/>
the clues now!<br/>
<br/>
Would you believe the mosquitos and ticks were still out looking for warm<br/>
blood? They show up well on a field of blaze orange, though.<br/>
<br/>
We of the Nocturnal Women's Hiking Guild (only 2 members to date ~ and we<br/>
haven't decided on the name. Maybe we should just join RIBNAG?) also found<br/>
in good condition the new Point Jude box and the Black Rock Point box, and<br/>
have a new-to-us hiker for whom we must find a ride (Burr was still hanging<br/>
out with the Sherlock crowd and is warming up in my backpack at present).<br/>
That means more 'boxing this weekend... in the light of day, mostly!  There<br/>
are still so many in RI we have yet to get that we will stay close to home<br/>
and concentrate on getting them before the clocks are turned back, further<br/>
limiting the daylight available.<br/>
<br/>
I can hardly wait until Betz and Batik want to venture out west to CT. Your<br/>
state is a letterboxing goldmine!<br/>

Thanks to Google, my map book and to CSCM for not giving it away, I figured <br/>
it out in about an hour or two all told . I am happy to say I have the little <br/>
men dancing in my logbook and my sleuth diploma...and a bunch of bug bites. Woo <br/>
Hoo!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Wanda and Pete for a fun puzzle!<br/>

p.s. CSCM pouted when he found that my diploma is bigger than his diploma LOL!<br/>
