on my Valley Forge box today.  The box was completely out of<br/>

water was inside.  Fortunately, I use the double box method, so<br/>
the inside box was sealed and dry, as was the logbook.  So here<br/>

Thanks Randy!  I'm on my way, but it's gonna have to cool down a little<br/>
first.  Great clues (without hunting yet) as usual.<br/>

<br/>We placed our first letterbox on Christmas Day, December 25, 2000 at <br/>Saugatuck Dunes State Park, Holland Michigan.  We'd like to call it "First <br/>Letterbox on the Lake" - as best we can tell, it is the first on Lake <br/>Michigan in Michigan, there are others on the west side of the lake in <br/>Wisconsin.
<br/>
<br/>Placed by Rainbow's End
<br/>
<br/>Clues:  Start from Saugatuck Dunes State Park. (Exit I-196 at the Saugatuck <br/>Exit, head southwest one block from the expressway.  Turn right onto 65th <br/>Street.  Go north one mile, then turn left onto 138th Avenue west.  Follow <br/>138th Ave. west 3/4 mile into the park, veering right at the fork.)  Proceed <br/>to the parking area.  Look for the North trail head and start your hike here.
<br/>Follow this trail north.  At the first fork in the trail, approx. 1/4 mile <br/>from the start, turn left (west) up the hill.  Continue to enjoy your hike <br/>and make your way to the shore of Lake Michigan.  While at the shore, be sure <br/>to collect one smooth rock, no larger than your fist, for every person on <br/>this letterbox hunt.  When you are ready to leave the lake, begin your hike <br/>back, starting on the same trail.  At the first intersection, less than 1/4 <br/>mile from the lake, keep straight, or due east.  In a few paces, you will <br/>have the choice of taking the outer loop or the inner loop trail.  You can <br/>pick either, both will take you to the letterbox.  (If you are getting tired, <br/>the inner loop trail is shorter;  if you like to hike, take the outer loop <br/>trail, it's only a little longer and more scenic)  When the two loop trails <br/>merge, head due south.  In less than 1/4 mile, you will !
come to a "Y" shaped <br/>intersection, a place you have been before!  If you are standing at the base <br/>of the "Y", look south west.  You will see a "bowl" created by the <br/>surrounding hills and dunes.  Walk roughly 90 paces south west into the bowl <br/>and head towards a large hemlock tree that grows within one yard of a <br/>deciduous tree.  When standing under these trees, proceed south west another <br/>60 paces to the point where the two large fallen soldiers meet.  Directly <br/>ahead of you, another 10 paces south west, you will see a large smooth barked <br/>tree with the neck of a giraffe, nibbling at the uppermost leaves of its <br/>neighboring trees.  At the base of this tree, you will find a pile of <br/>fist-sized rocks.  Under these rock will be the letterbox!
<br/>When you open the letterbox and added your stamp and date, please be sure to <br/>close the letterbox securely,  Now is the time to place the rocks you <br/>collected from the shore, add them with the other rocks, and cover the letter <br/>box to hide it away for the next seeker.

Mount Baldy Letterbox
<br/>Saugatuck, Michigan
<br/>Allegan County
</p><p><b>Clues:</b>
<br/>Mount Baldy is located on Ferry St. in Saugatuck, Michigan.  This
giant sand dune was considered a sacred spot for area Indian tribes who
used to sacrifice a white dog at the top each spring.  They thought
this would drive out evil winter spirits.  During World War II, a
radar device was built at the top of this dune.  Today, many 
trees have been planted at the top to help reduce erosion on the dune.
</p><p>When you climb all 282 steps to get to the top of Mt. Baldy, you'll
be able to see both Lake Michigan to the west and the Kalamazoo River to
the east.  Stop for a rest at step 55 and look at the two Maple trees
to the south that seem to be dancing the Tango with their roots and branches. 
As you continue to climb, don't believe the message that is scrawled on
step 173 or you might get discouraged.
</p><p>Continue to the top and enjoy the view. There's an observation deck
to the left that gives a spectacular view of the Kalamazoo River. 
You will also see many trails leading away from this area and our letterbox
is hidden near one of these trails.  Beginning from step 282, go straight
towards Lake Michigan until you see the trail that begins by 2 wooden posts. 
Head south on this trail until you reach a fork in the path.  Take
the one that is closer to Lake Michigan.  Count off about 38 paces
and look for another pair of dancing trees on your right.  One is
a Sassafras and the other one is a Maple.  Now look for a "centipede"
very close to these two dancers.  Your search for our letterbox should
end when you look under the centipede's legs.

Whimsy Village Cairn
<br/>                                  
Planted January 27, 2002 by Butterfly
<p>If whimsy strikes your fancy, then visit Whimsy Village, a delight for
children of all ages.
<br/>Clue in with the Drew Clan's <i>Whimsy Walk, </i>for directions to
the park and take a side trip to the Village..
<br/>This is a very easy walk that you can pick up a letterbox before you
even see the water or reach the treasures of <i> Whimsy Walk.</i>
<br/>Just a short way on the trail, from the entrance of the park, watch
carefully for a small side trail on your right. This is the Whimsy Village
Trail, a loop that returns to the main trail. Bring a painted rock or gift
for the village. You may visit awhile and play if you wish.
<br/>The Whimsy Village Cairn Letterbox sits beside the Whimsy Wee-Elf Tree
House.  Carefully move the pot aside and the village letterbox is
under the stone. Stamp in and reset the Village Cairn Pot.
<br/>Enjoy, and have a Butterfly Day.

On a ridge between Garden Creek and Widows Creek is the remains of a gold<br/>
mine.. really only a prospect, but still a neat destination for a hike.<br/>
Start at the Garden Creek Church inside Stone Mountain Park.  Take the trail<br/>
that follows Garden Creek from the paved road for approximately 800 paces.<br/>
Take the road on your right that heads up the ridge.  (You might want to<br/>
explore the old house site on your left.  It has one of the largest fir<br/>
trees in the park.)  After you go about 75 yards look on the top of the left<br/>
bank.  There are several interesting grave sites.  Return to the road and<br/>
follow it up the ridge for approximately 2 miles.  As you top the ridge<br/>
there will be two rock cairns on your right.  From there head 310 degrees<br/>
for 190 paces to the top of the knob.  Then follow the ridge at 300 degrees<br/>
and 175 paces to a saddle and to the first prospecting pit.  From the pit,<br/>
go 280 degrees for 60 paces to the main pit.  Then go 320 degrees for 30<br/>
paces and look behind a larger rock for the letterbox.  Before leaving, pay<br/>
your respects at the two graves located 180 degrees and 160 paces from the<br/>
main pit.   <br/>

I cannot find anything in your posting that identifies the state (nor the<br/>
county or nearest town) for this letterbox.<br/>

We now have clues for thousands of letterboxes on-line. We really need to<br/>
have this info included.<br/>

Please post these clues.  <br/>I hope I did this correctly.  My only question is about the disclaimer.  I know that you have to add the statement about reading it but do I have to have it included in my clues or is this something that is linked to the site somewhere?<br/>Thanks, Judi (tecihila) <br/><br/><br/><br/><p>Butte Fork Falls Letterbox</p><br/>
<p>Ruch, Oregon</p><br/>
<p>Jackson County</p><br/>
<p>Planted on Sept. 2, 2002</p><br/>
<p>By Tecihila </p><br/>
<p>Trail Length: Approximately 2 1/2 miles roundtrip</p><br/>
<p>Trail Difficulty: Moderate  Hikers and Horses Only</p><br/>
<p>Season: June through October</p><br/>
<p>Clue Difficulty: Easy</p><br/>
<p>Directions: From the town of Ruch, Oregon, take Upper Applegate Road 18.8 miles to Carberry Creek Road. Turn left and go 1.3 miles to the signed junction of Forest Roads 1040 and 1050. Turn right onto Road 1040 and go 3.6 miles to the Horse Camp Trailhead on the left and stop here. </p><br/>
<p> </p><br/>
<p>As far as I know, the waterfall has no name, so I am calling it Butte Fork Falls because it just seems to fit. This is a nice hike with the trail steadily inclining the entire distance giving it the "moderate" rating. Using my best guess, I figure you might climb 1500 feet in the mile or so to the letterbox. Be sure to stop occasionally and take in the views. Although you might be tempted to take a nice cooling shower in the waterfall when you reach it, you might want to try one toe at a time as the water is quite cold even in September. </p><br/>
<p> </p><br/>
<p>To find this letterbox, begin on the Horse Camp Trail. You will make a right hairpin turn around a rather large tree that is secured with a cable at its base. Continue up the trail past a left hairpin turn. There is a visible difference in the plants and trees at this point in the trail. There will be two stumps on your left and an abundance of manzanita all around. After you have hiked about  of a mile, you will come to a sign indicating Butte Fork #957 to your right and Horse Camp Trail to your left. Go right and follow the trail about another half mile to Butte Fork Falls. After you soak in the beauty of these falls, remember why you are here. Beside you on the upside of the trail are a few pine trees; the last ones before the waterfall. Approximately 3 feet in front of these trees and very slightly to the left is a stack of rocks under which you will find the Butte Fork Falls letterbox. </p><br/>
<p> </p><br/>
<p>This is the first letterbox that I have planted. Please send any advice, feedback, or problems to: <a href="mailto:ex-caligirl@excite.com">ex-caligirl@excite.com</a> </p><br/>

<br/>
Spot in Idaho History<br/>
First state park in the northwest.<br/>
Created in 1908 from  7,838 acres of Coeur dAlene Indian reservation lands.<br/>
CCC built much of the structures in the 1930s<br/>
Today the southern part of Lake Coeur dAlene has been returned to the tribe<br/>
who gave up so much  of their land for this scenic state park.<br/>
<br/>
Now that you have identified which Idaho state park this is, you can grab a<br/>
map and drive there.<br/>
<br/>
Take the park headquarters road.<br/>
Drive to the Chiefs Landing  trail head parking area.<br/>
Park and walk a short distance through the metal gate up the logging road.<br/>
On your right you will see a DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE sign on a pole. Shortly<br/>
past this there will be a trail off to your left.<br/>
Take this trail until you see the guy wire on your right.<br/>
Stop here. To your left are two trees. Between these trees is a pile of<br/>
blackened<br/>
debris. This is it.<br/>
I placed this before there was growth of any kind so it may later be<br/>
overgrown with plants.<br/>

I'm always happy to see a new box in Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
You did fine with your posting--here are some suggestions for future postings:<br/>
In the subject line, write the state first, like: OR: new letterbox (this <br/>
alerts both the webmaster who places OR boxes on the website, and all us OR <br/>
boxers that there's a new one for us---we get discouraged wading thru all <br/>
those CT box messages ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You could use this format, which makes it easier for the webmasters to place <br/>
your box in the proper place:<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox Name: "Cape Kiwanda"<br/>
Placed by: Hedgehog, Londan callin' &amp; See Biscuit<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
Date: March 29, 2003<br/>
City: Lincoln City<br/>
County: Tillamook<br/>
State: OR<br/>
LbNA regional page URL:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/or/or_ncst.htm<br/>
<br/>
Another opening format that people sometimes use is "On March 29, 2003, <br/>
Hedgehog, Londan callin' &amp; See Biscuit planted the Cape Kiwanda letterbox <br/>
near Lincoln City, Tillamook County, OR."<br/>
