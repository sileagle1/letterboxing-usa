Hunt this box at your own risk.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:      Somewhat Easy<br/>
Terrain:          Challenging<br/>
Time:       3 hours<br/>
<br/>
This is a dinosaur themed series.  I plan to expand this series in the <br/>
northern section of this park in the not too distant future.  Also, there are <br/>
other letterboxes in this area that this series can be combined with for a <br/>
longer hike.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
Route 287 to Skyline Drive, exit 57.  Shortly up Skyline drive on the left is <br/>
the 1st parking lot for the Ramapo Mountain State Forest.  Pass this lot and <br/>
continue going up Skyline drive. At the top of the mountain there is a <br/>
parking lot on the left. <br/>
<br/>
The centerpiece of Ramapo Mountain State Forest is Ramapo Lake, which was <br/>
formerly known as Rotten Pond by the early Dutch settlers.  Take your time <br/>
and enjoy the many viewpoints these trails provide.     <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Start at white trail across street from parking lot.  Continue down white <br/>
trail until you come to a clearing offering a view.  There will be a large <br/>
rock on the left side of the trail with a blaze on it.  From the blaze go 39 <br/>
steps at 100 degrees.  There will be a split rock; under a rock in the split <br/>
is what you are looking for.  Use a stick, just in case.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Continue along white trail.  Cross Skyline drive and pick up white trail on <br/>
the other side.  When you come to the blue trail go right. When you arrive at <br/>
Ramapo Lake go over the bridge.  The centerpiece of Ramapo Mountain State <br/>
Forest is Ramapo Lake, which was formerly known as Rotten Pond by the early <br/>
Dutch settlers.   Shortly down the fire road the red trail begins on the <br/>
left.  Take red trail.  Pay careful attention to the blazes.  After a climb, <br/>
the trail makes a winding turn, continue to follow trail to the next set of <br/>
blazes.  There will be a single red painted blaze next another tree with a <br/>
nailed on round red blaze.  Turn around and go back down trail 12 paces to an <br/>
unblazed tree.  From the unblazed tree go 50 paces at 225 degrees to the end <br/>
of a rock formation.  From that vantage point you should be able to see <br/>
Pompton Lake.  From there go 25 paces at 140 degrees.  Note there is a 4-foot <br/>
drop off along these 25 paces, be careful.  Behind a small tree there is a <br/>
natural rock cavity with a square shoebox size rock covering the opening.  <br/>
Within the cavity is what you are searching for.  Use a stick, just in case.  <br/>
Replace rock after stamping in.<br/>

<br/>
Now continue along red trail the way you didn't come.  When trail meets up <br/>
with yellow trail, take the yellow trail, not the merged red-yellow trail.  <br/>
Again pay careful attention to the blazes, as there are some tricky areas <br/>
along this trail.  Trail merges with fire road; continue to follow it until <br/>
trail restarts on left up the fire road.  You'll come to a large glacial <br/>
erratic.  There will be a blazed tree to the left of the rock.  From blazed <br/>
tree continue going down trail 53 paces.  On left of trail will be two <br/>
boulders.  Behind the left one, behind a rock is what you are searching for.  <br/>
Use a stick, just in case.  Replace rock after stamping in.  <br/>
<br/>
There are several ways to get back to the parking lot.  I recommend going <br/>
back to the fire road, taking it the way you didn't come.  When fire road <br/>
forks, take right fork and enjoy the walk along Ramapo Lake back to the <br/>
bridge. Cross bridge and pick up yellow trail on the right.  Yellow trail <br/>
leads back to parking at the top of the mountain.<br/>
