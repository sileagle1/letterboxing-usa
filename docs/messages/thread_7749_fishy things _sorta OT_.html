the Porgy and Bass letterboxes, which will be planted on the rocks along<br/>
Ocean Rd.  I also deckhanded for three years out of Galilee (before I<br/>
shredded my shoulder).  The first boat I fished on was a little beach boat<br/>
that ran singles along that section of coast.  The captain had recently<br/>
scrubbed his ex's name off of the stern, and I kept trying to talk him into<br/>
Porgy and Bass as a name since we also scupped, and were tormented by the<br/>
bloody stripers.  Stripers are fun, unless you're trying to earn a living.<br/>

I better get my tush in gear and get those boxes planted!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Yeah, gps is a cool way to enhance your clues. There are a few<br/>
&gt; floating around. Ben of RIBNAG once sent me an amazing database of<br/>
&gt; coordinates for letterboxes of ours that he had found.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also love www.topozone.com and use it all the time (and am amazed<br/>
&gt; that it is still free). Just like the folks who don't use a gps to<br/>
&gt; geocache, you don't need coordinates to use topozone. You can just<br/>
&gt; type in the town or park or mountain or whatever and it'll point you<br/>
&gt; to the map you need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back in the day I was lobstering out of Newport RI and we used Loran,<br/>
&gt; but now my favorite use for my gps is striper fishing. We can get<br/>
&gt; within inches of Ned's Hole out in the Race and believe me, that's<br/>
&gt; some fun fishing!<br/>
