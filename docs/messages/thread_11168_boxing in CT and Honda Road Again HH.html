                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a fruitful day boxing in SE CT today.  We figured we had to <br/>
get in what boxing we could before MORE SNOW (big groan) hit again <br/>
tomorrow!  Everything was still snowy and frozen, but better than <br/>
it's been for a while.   We hit the new DEP box in Pauchaug State <br/>
Forest and met up with Wanda there.  Found that in order and well.  <br/>
Unfortunately we can't say the same for Misery Loves Company.  From <br/>
there we found some roses which Wanda had thoughtfully dug out.  Red <br/>
Roses for You and a Little Rose Too were in good shape, and we picked <br/>
up the Honda Road Again HH there!  Then we went down to Mystery Falls <br/>
and found that one safe and dry.  All in all, a great day.  We really <br/>
enjoyed boxing with Wanda.<br/>

P.S. If anyone is planning on doing the DEP box, please be carefull.  <br/>
There is lots of ice on the trail going up!!<br/>
