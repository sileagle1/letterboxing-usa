How about when I pick up then drop off an existing hitchhiker. Do I <br/>
post where it was dropped off [seemed like that would spoil the fun <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In our humble opinion, you can post that you have launched a <br/>
hitchhiker without telling its exact position.  Half of the fun is <br/>
stumbling upon it.  As for finding one, personally we would like to <br/>
hear where our hitchhiker (Dragon's Tale) was picked up and what <br/>
shape it's in, but not exactly where it's going (ie heading North <br/>
etc. is ok).<br/>
Hope this was helpful to you!<br/>

Not necessarily contradicting anything that has been said in this<br/>
thread -- but on the matter of HH secrecy/disclosure, we should <br/>
respect the wishes of the person who created it, if those wishes <br/>
are known.<br/>
