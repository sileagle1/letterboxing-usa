                    <div class="plaintext-content">Red's Bunch was "half-staffed" on our trip to Orlando, having dropped <br/>
the kids off at their Grandparents for the week. Dang, didn't we have <br/>
fun! Silly Ol' Bear had a conference to attend, but there was plenty <br/>
of time for letterboxing after the meetings. We picked up 12 new <br/>
boxes and a hitchhiker! (We also fed a goodly number of biting <br/>
insects.) All of these boxes, logbooks, stamps and hidey-holes are in <br/>
great shape, except for Canaveral Marshes. If you're planning an <br/>
Orlando vacation this summer, or if you've ever been to these boxes, <br/>
please check out these updates.<br/>
<br/>
REPTILE RACE: 5/3/04 It was raining the day we arrived, but that <br/>
never bothers us. The woman who charged us for admission to the park <br/>
thought we were crazy and she didn't want to leave her booth in the <br/>
rain. This was a pretty path and a nicely hidden box. We'd have <br/>
stayed longer but the deerflies and skeeters were bad, even with the <br/>
rain.<br/>
DISNEY#1, CELEBRATION: 5/3/04 This town is so pleasant and clean that <br/>
it's creepy. We took the box back to the car to stamp in, and one <br/>
resident stood on his porch talking on his cell phone the whole time. <br/>
The logbook indicated that a hitchhiker had been left, so when I <br/>
replaced the box I looked a little harder, and there it was: <br/>
THESE BOOTS ARE MADE FOR WALKIN', and they've been doing so since <br/>
December of 2001!  The placer forgot to stamp "Boots" <br/>
into "Celebration", and vicey-versey; we didn't notice until we had <br/>
left. This hitcher is my favorite, a really charming stamp.<br/>
MOSS PARK/SPLIT OAK FOREST: 5/5/04 It took us awhile to find the <br/>
trailhead, but this hike was worth the effort. The trees are <br/>
magnificent, the forest path is such a pleasant walk, and the Split <br/>
Oak was amazing. Found both boxes without trouble. We had to hoof it <br/>
back to the car in a rush, though, because it was close to closing <br/>
time and Silly Ol' Bear was afraid they were going to lock the gates <br/>
on us. We made it just in time.<br/>
CANAVERAL MARSHES: 5/6/04 I went off on my own for this one, while <br/>
Silly Ol' Bear was in meetings. Parked the car, got out my backpack, <br/>
and noticed that our kit was missing; I had left it back in our hotel <br/>
room, a 45 minute drive away. I rummaged around in the trunk and <br/>
found a backup, a stamp I haven't placed yet and an inkpad we don't <br/>
use anymore. Oh well. This box needs some TLC, just as the clues <br/>
indicate. It may need to be retired; everything needs replacing, <br/>
including the stamp, which is broken into 5 pieces and is crumbling <br/>
away to bits. There's another stamp in the box, made of stone, which <br/>
is also broken.<br/>
MERRITT ISLAND ARMADILLO: 5/6/04 To paraphrase a southernism, I <br/>
couldn't get there from here. The causeway to the island was closed <br/>
for construction, and after traveling along the detour route for 12 <br/>
miles I had run out of time and had to turn around.<br/>
SNOWY EGRET: 5/6/04 Loved this stamp! Easily the largest one we ever <br/>
logged, and the hike wins the award for the trail that most reminded <br/>
us of a jungle safari. Again, we wished we were able to arrive <br/>
earlier, because this Disney Preserve looked to be well worth a full <br/>
day of trail hiking. They're very serious about closing the trails at <br/>
4:30.<br/>
DISNEY#2, WILDERNESS LODGE: 5/6/04 This lodge is amazing! Must be <br/>
seen, even if you don't rent a room there. While walking back from <br/>
the box, we met a puzzled looking man carrying a piece of paper. We <br/>
thought at first that he was an employee, but I got a better look at <br/>
the paper, it turned out that he was seeking the same letterbox! We <br/>
helped him out a little, since the clues confused us at first, too. <br/>
Later that night, I realized that we should have had a stamp <br/>
exchange! It was the first time we ever encountered another <br/>
letterboxer before, so it simply didn't occur to us at the time.<br/>
DISNEY#3, CARIBBEAN BEACH: 5/6/04 Very straightforward, great hidey-<br/>
hole.<br/>
FALLEN LOG CROSSING TRAIL: 5/7/04 Our last Orlando box, we scheduled <br/>
this one for the morning on our way out of town. This is by far the <br/>
nicest, most well maintained facility we've ever seen. The Nature <br/>
Conservatory folks are great. Boardwalks are great. Stamp was really <br/>
great (our favorite this trip). I especially enjoyed pretending I was <br/>
on Gilligan's Island.<br/>
MY OLD STOMPING GROUND SERIES: 5/7/04 (Gainesville) Classes were out <br/>
at the U of Florida, so (they say) foot traffic was light. We looked <br/>
for the reportedly MIA "Century Tower" and didn't find it, but <br/>
weren't surprised considering the location. "Go Gators" and "Gator <br/>
Trails" were fine and dandy (despite the erroneous report that "Go <br/>
Gators" was MIA). For some reason I can't put my finger on, I really <br/>
enjoyed this series. Being on a college campus again, I suppose.<br/>
HOWLING PUP: 5/7/04 Although the park's "waterfall" was bone dry, the <br/>
trail itself was pleasant and we were impressed with the efforts of <br/>
the boy scouts here. You wouldn't think that trees could get this big <br/>
in a state that sees so many hurricanes.<br/>
<br/>
We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, and would like to thank all those <br/>
who placed these boxes (Deneal, Bill &amp; Craig, Noelle, Alex and Kevin, <br/>
Dr. Mings &amp; Jay in CT, Mary Manatee &amp; The Yachtsman, Tweety &amp; Mr. <br/>
Coon, Tony &amp; Nikki, and BoxingBuddy). We especially thank you for <br/>
sharing some of your favorite places with us. It was also great fun <br/>
seeing the stamps that all the visitors to these boxes left behind, a <br/>
truly nationwide group.<br/>
<br/>
Y'all come see us in Georgia, y'hear?<br/>
