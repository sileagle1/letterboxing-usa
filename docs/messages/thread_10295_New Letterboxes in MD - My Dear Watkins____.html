<br/>
Watkins Regional Park, Prince George's County, MD<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  They require a bit of imagination.<br/>
Terrain:  A series of 5 boxes on a one mile loop.  The walk is fairly <br/>
easy with a few hills.  <br/>
Placed:  1/12/03 by Celtic Pride<br/>
Nearest town:  Mitchellville<br/>
<br/>
Directions to park:  Take exit 15A Central Ave East (Rt. 214) from the <br/>
Capital Beltway (495/95).  Go approximately 4 miles and turn right onto <br/>
Watkins Park Dr. (Rt. 193).  Go 1 mile and the park will be on your <br/>
right.  Follow the signs to the Nature Center.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to boxes:  Park at the Nature Center and head around back <br/>
and take notice of the wonderful Raptors caged there.  Please don't <br/>
pester them as they are a bit skittish.  From there,  head to your <br/>
right and onto the blue/yellow blazed trail.<br/>
<br/>
As the stage is set for your quest,  head around backstage and continue <br/>
on the trail.  Good deductive reasoning is required, as following the <br/>
trail can be tricky.  Take a couple of steps up into 221B Baker street <br/>
and into your adventure.<br/>
<br/>
After passing some footbridges, the alert detective notices a series of <br/>
root locks regulating the water level in a small stream.  Curiosity <br/>
gets the better of you, and you head 30 degrees to the uppermost lock.  <br/>
Looking around in an easterly direction, you notice two men, one larger <br/>
than the other, standing close and talking low so no one can overhear <br/>
them.  What they don't know is that just beyond them, within earshot, <br/>
hidden in a small log behind some rocks, Sherlock is listening!<br/>
<br/>
What did he hear?  Is Moriarty up to something?  What is his dastardly <br/>
plan?  Are there too many questions?  Sherlock ponders as he continues <br/>
down the traildoes he hear music?  Yes, there are too many questions.  <br/>
He knows the music has a calming influence on the soul and thinks that <br/>
it is just what his mind needs.  Unfortunately, the music suddenly goes <br/>
wild and looking off to the right of the trail, he sees that the <br/>
orchestra has become a tangled mass of wood and strings.  From there he <br/>
looks a little up the trail and to the right and sees a lone bow <br/>
resting on the neck of his beloved violin.  At the base of this <br/>
instrument, Sherlock's musicmaker can be found.<br/>
<br/>
Well rested and with soothed nerves, our hero continues on his way.  He <br/>
knows his foe is somewhere ahead, but where?  He needs to find clues to <br/>
his whereabouts.  Remembera good detective can figure out the correct <br/>
way to go.  Even though a bridge may be washed out, the right way <br/>
should be elementary!  Crossing through the murky swamp he wonders, "I <br/>
wonder what is lurking below the surface?  I'm not sure I want to find <br/>
out!  I'd better walk carefully so as not to fall in."  When finally a <br/>
decision needs to be made  to go 130 degrees or 328 degrees - Sherlock <br/>
doesn't ponder looking around.  He knows to go NNW, but what next?  He <br/>
stops to think at the first very large leaning post on the left side of <br/>
the trail.  He glances around and wondersis someone spying on me from <br/>
a secret lookout?  He heads in that direction to see what he can find.  <br/>
He spies a double-wide tree containing a secret passageway from the <br/>
trunk to the baseis there something there?  Nooit is too easy - maybe <br/>
he has been set up.  As he turns, he sees someone race across the <br/>
triple-deck natural bridge and he boldly gives chase.  He sees <br/>
something (maybe a clue?) fall as his foe races off of the bridge and <br/>
out of sight.  He searches the area and at the end of the third deck, <br/>
his clue finder hits paydirt!<br/>
<br/>
Now that he has his clue, Sherlock thinks, "I am now in need of a good <br/>
smoke after a day's hard work."  He continues on the trail and stops <br/>
where, if Mother Nature had her way, the trail would be blocked.  He <br/>
decides to sit at the end of the stool nearest the swamp.  Here, where <br/>
many sticks meet, he finds his smokestack.<br/>
<br/>
He heads back home, retracing his steps back down the trail.  When he <br/>
gets to his prior decision point, he heads in the direction not yet <br/>
taken.  Up the stairs and down the stairs, he heads for home.  On his <br/>
way, to the left of the trail, Watson is giving him a bow.  At Watson's <br/>
feet there is a Hat Off to You for completing the adventure!  Continue <br/>
on this trail to the Nature Center parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:	1)  Off trail walking through some brambles is required.  Be <br/>
careful when poking into holes and under logs.<br/>
		2)  A compass is not really needed, but might prove useful.  <br/>
A good detective always has many instruments at his disposal!<br/>
