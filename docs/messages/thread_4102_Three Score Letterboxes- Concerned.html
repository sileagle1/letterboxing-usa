<div><strong>Dear Letterboxers</strong></div>
<div><strong>   Yesterday, we did the Three Score Letterboxes and we 
were upset to see that others before us had , in what may have been their zeal 
to find the letterbox, collapsed a portion of a magnificent old stone wall on 
the Preserve. It was most disheartening to see. We tried to pick up some of the 
stones but had great difficulty- we are not spring chickens. Please remember 
that it is imperative that we</strong></div>
<div><strong>always leave a place , not the same, but better than when we found 
it-  that means ourselves as well as the grounds.   Thanks, 
Nancy</strong></div>
