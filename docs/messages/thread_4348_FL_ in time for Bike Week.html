I have decided to create a series of boxes planted within a few acres of <br/>
each other.  Each hand-carved stamp in the series depicts an image taken <br/>
from Timucuan (Tim-YEW-kyu-un) art or artifacts.<br/>
<br/>
The Timucuans were the original human Floridians; averaging close to seven <br/>
feet tall, they were wiped out by diseases imported by the earliest European <br/>
explorers.   Little evidence of their culture remains; what is left is <br/>
visible in the shell mounds they left, and in the artifacts dredged from the <br/>
rivers or dug from other mounds.<br/>
<br/>
"Swamp Owl" is the first in the series; it is already in place and in the <br/>
clue book.  The others - 4 or 5 I think - will be in place before Bike Week <br/>
starts.<br/>
