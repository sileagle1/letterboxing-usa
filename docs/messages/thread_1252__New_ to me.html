letterbox series that he discovered while surfing "letterboxing" in <br/>
his favorite search engine. I was flabbergasted to learn there are <br/>
20 letterboxes close-by in MA and RI that I hadn't heard of and that <br/>
aren't "on the map" at LBNA. I've written to the owners asking if we <br/>
can link to them officially, but meanwhile thought I'd give you all <br/>
the URLs so you can go look for them too. I also teased out a couple <br/>
more sites, one in CO and one in MN. Enjoy!<br/>

Now, I'm sure there must be more we don't know about! For instance, <br/>
there are 3 or 4 letterboxes here in my area that are not on line but <br/>
are available at the EMS Store in Waterford, CT (no commercial <br/>
affiliation, BTW, but they have been great in promoting the sport in <br/>
CT)<br/>

Lone Wolf stamped this one first too (8/23/99) :-)<br/>
(sorry, hunting for letterboxing sites is like hunting<br/>
for boxes)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Colorado's claimed first letterbox (link doesn't work?)<br/>
&gt; http://www.gigagraphica.com/Michelle/letrbox.html<br/>
<br/>
This does look like a new find, though perhaps this<br/>
should remain speculative at best until somehow comfirmed<br/>
or the clues found.  Perhaps its a mystery mystery<br/>
box :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now, I'm sure there must be more we don't know about! <br/>
<br/>
Prolly more than we _do_ know about.  That's what I've always<br/>
thought anyway (I think many letterboxers are not into the<br/>
internet -- we're used to letterboxers who are and might<br/>
find that notion absurd).  Remember, the CEE-Antioch (VQ)<br/>
fellow (Dr. Sobel I believe his name is) claims to have <br/>
started in 1989 and they had 52 when LbNA had not that<br/>
many (its interesting that the whole VQ program, including<br/>
URL, was mentioned in another letterbox stamped by Dr. Sobel, <br/>
that's how I learned about it anyway, and because of a bug<br/>
in the Institute's html at the time, the search bots could <br/>
never find it)<br/>
<br/>
There's also <br/>
http://pages.hotbot.com/travel/fire.fly/letterboxing.html<br/>
which has been on the faq since 2/99 but I've never heard<br/>
anything more about it ...<br/>
<br/>
