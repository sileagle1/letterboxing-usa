<br/>
I happened to stubmle onto the LBNA site yesterday and I've spent the <br/>
past day looking at different letterboxing sites.  I noticed that <br/>
there don't seem to be many letterboxes located in National Parks.<br/>
<br/>
I read on the LBNA FAQ that there are some places that have <br/>
restricted use on them.  Are National Parks some of these places?  I <br/>
would like to know before I get myself into trouble by placing a box <br/>
in one.  : )<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

there has been others that met the same fate across the country.There is a<br/>

appropriate consideration to their actions.Don<br/>
