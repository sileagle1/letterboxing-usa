Park, here is what I found (or did not find, as the case may be).<br/>
<br/>
BOX #1 - Hermit Crab Letterbox:  The box is there however it was full of<br/>
salt marsh water.  The log is completely soaked.  There is a pen and the top<br/>
to the stamp pad.   The stamp is missing.<br/>
<br/>
BOX #2 - Gathering Letterbox: I believe that this box is gone.  The area at<br/>
the base of the tree appears to have been cleared out, possibly by the last<br/>
person who reported it missing not to long ago.<br/>
<br/>
BOX #3 - Resolution Letterbox: This box is alive and well, and the ants are<br/>
gone.  However the top to the stamp pad is broken.<br/>
