Since my last message had about a page and a half between salutation and message, I thought I would fumble through another try with a few changes.This box has been declared abandoned by LbNA. I would like to adopt it as Maintainer. <br/>
I have visited a couple of times and have not found the box. I have also sent a message to the Placer.<br/>
If anyone knows the Placer OR has found the box, please let me know. <br/>
I would like to keep this one in our system if possible. <br/>
If budgets allow we may have a Fairfax Cross Count Trail someday.<br/>
