<br/>
I will go and coordinate a bulk order.  I figured I will be able to <br/>
order the medallions and send them out for $3.35 each.  I anticipated <br/>
the possibility of having to pay the $10 fee to have the image <br/>
redrawn as well as the shipping.  I am not in this too make money.  <br/>
If there are no objections, if there is money left over, I will use <br/>
it to plant a couple more letter boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Please send your payments to:<br/>
<br/>
James Dillon<br/>
PO Box 15<br/>
Talisheek, LA  70464<br/>
<br/>
or paypal them to me at n0kwa@bellsouth.net (no credit cards).  <br/>
If you don't have a paypal account, check them out at <br/>
www.paypal.com.  Consider listing my email as the one referring you <br/>
if you set up a new account.<br/>
<br/>
I would prefer payment by paypal or with bills registered with <br/>
www.wheresgeorge.com.<br/>
<br/>
I also collect stamps, so interesting stamps on the envelop are <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
I will take orders through December 15, 2003, at which time I will <br/>
send the order to Hermann Werks.  They estimate a 2 to 4 week turn <br/>
around.  I am guessing that you will have your medallions by the end <br/>
of January or beginning of February.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to order a large number of medallions, let me know <br/>
and I can figure a discount for shipping and such.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to email me at my personal address with any <br/>
questions.<br/>
