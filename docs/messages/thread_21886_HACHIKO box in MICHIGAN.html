                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received an email from someone who had twice searched unsuccessfully <br/>
for the Hachiko box in Parker MIll Park.  Unfortunately I deleted the <br/>
message before I had a chance to respond.I checked on the box this <br/>
morning, it is safely in it's hiding place. The last boxer to stamp in <br/>
was (were) Senor Critez, Faith, Lisa, tak, and B. Daily on 4/10/05. I <br/>
removed the logbook, as it is almost full, and will replace it soon. I <br/>
left a couple of pages to stamp into until the new book is placed.<br/>
For any unsuccessful seekers, consider the phrase "in plain sight", or <br/>
email me for more (possibly "spoiler" clues)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, 3K9, do I know you? (Loved the Tristan stamp!)Are Jade and Django <br/>
also part of the three K9 group? I should by rights be called <br/>
Clickermom4, becuase I've added Leeloo to the pack.<br/>
