once we got there, if we had just stamped in and not stayed, they<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just love these kind of posts. I remember once last year someone got a little cranky and complained that people should do their own research when visiting an area and not rely on others to tell them what boxes to hunt or some such nonsense. They must not have been eating enough roughage that week or something. Anyway, I love posts like this because it gives others a chance to chime in with "Hey, we're gonna be there too!" or "Hey, I live in that area" and set up a meeting or exchange. If anyone is ever flying through Philly Int'l Airport, or within 2 hours of Philly on vacation please shoot me an email. I love to meet a greet fellow letterboxers both near and far.<br/>
