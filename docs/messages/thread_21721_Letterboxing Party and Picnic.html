Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to just touch base with everyone. We will be letterboxing<br/>
next weekend<br/>
(Letterboxing / picnic April 16 12:00 Tawawa Park).<br/>
<br/>
. This is going to be alot of fun. I wanted to prepare everyone.<br/>
So, here is a couple of notes.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, this is a picnic and your entire family is invited.<br/>
Everyone should bring a covered dish to share.<br/>
<br/>
Second, anyone can come in costume. A prize will be given for the<br/>
best costumes, (which will include all).<br/>
<br/>
Third, we will be putting together a couple of boxes to be sent to<br/>
children orpaned because of the tsunami. To help in this, please<br/>
bring anything you might think a child would enjoy that would fit<br/>
inside a shoebox. We will collect the boxes and organize them.<br/>
Dana Kittner our treasurer will mail them for us. The items do not<br/>
need to be expensive or fancy and it is not necessary to bring more<br/>
than you can afford. The idea is just to share our love with these<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, each child/participant should bring a stamp. Homemade,<br/>
store bought, thumb prints work well too. The stamp can be anything<br/>
and any design. Have fun. If you are not familiar with stamp<br/>
making, Shoe cushions work great and the old fashioned brown<br/>
erasers.<br/>
<br/>
We will have book stamping, so, bring a notebook, spiral, pad of<br/>
paper.... To share stamps and autographs.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if it is storming we will reschedule.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing everyone.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Angel<br/>
