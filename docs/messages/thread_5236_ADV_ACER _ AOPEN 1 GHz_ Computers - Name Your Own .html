<p>100 Computers At Huge Discount.</p>
<p>PC 2NUPS, Inc.</p>
<p>783 Rio Del Mar Blvd. Aptos, CA 95003 800-PC2NUPS 831-662-3600</p>
<p>Recently, one of our best customers ordered 100 Micron PCs at $499 each. Dutifully, we called our vendor and placed the order. A few days later, our customer called and cancelled their order due to unforeseen circumstances. We tried to cancel our order but our vendor refused to take them back.</p>
<p>Now We Are Stuck With 100 Computers We Must Sell.</p>
<p>These are brand new 900 Mhz PCs with 128 MB of RAM, 20 Gigabyte hard disk drives, 52X CD-ROMS, 56K PCI modems, 32 MB ATI Xpert2000 Pro AGP video cards, integrated sound adapters, Mitsumi 1.44 floppy, mouse and keyboard. <i>Manufactured by Micron</i>, a NYSE company.</p>
<p>Our misfortune is your opportunity! We have no choice! We cant send them back and we cant store them. We have to sell them even if we dont make a profit! We have decided to lower the price on these 100 computers to <i>just $389. </i>An almost unheard of bargain. Youll <i>save $110.</i></p>
<p>We have just 100 of these computers to sell at this low price. When they are gone, your chance to save on a great computer system by a top notch company will go with them. Call us today at 800-722-6877 (M-F 8:30AM - 6:00PM PST). Take advantage of our mistake.</p>
<p>But do it at once, this opportunity to save money <i>will not </i>occur again.</p>
<p>Yours Up To 100,</p>
<p>The Folks At PC 2NUPS.</p>
<p>P.S.: Buy Today and Get a <b><i>FREE</i></b> Pair of Speakers.</p>
