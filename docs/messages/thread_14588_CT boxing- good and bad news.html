                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today took us to the Cedar Cemetery Boxes in Hartford- this is like <br/>
no other cemetery i've ever been to- it not only is huge, but alot of <br/>
the monuments are nothing less than phenomenal.  All 4 boxes are in <br/>
great shape- and the hand cut stamps are always a treat for me.  The <br/>
clues are fun to read and hiding places are very clever.  This place <br/>
has a parklike (is that a word?) feel to it, complete with a pond and <br/>
lots of ducks. We even saw a deer!!  Unfortunately our second quest <br/>
was not such a pleasant find.. we went to Frog's Dinner in Chester <br/>
only to find the box thoroughly destroyed, and no signs of the log or <br/>
stamp were anywhere.  Ron and I don't agree on who or what did the <br/>
damage- he thinks a raccoon, and I think it was the 2 legged variety <br/>
of "pest"(I'll be polite).  Any way, we had a great day boxing and <br/>
are now up to F186-- not bad, since we just started in March,huh??-- <br/>
Happy boxing--Sunshine and Swamp Yankee<br/>
