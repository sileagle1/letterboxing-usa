puppies and I headed down to Middlesex near beautiful Canandaigua Lake <br/>
to look for JeLyBean's letterbox on Spook Hill. And Spooky it sure is. <br/>
It's quite a sensation to have your car, in neutral, slowly roll to a <br/>
stop on what appears to be a down hill section of road, then, still in <br/>
neutral, begin to roll backward up the hill. Really strange! Anyway, <br/>
there it was, a pristine virgin Letterbox with a beautifully carved <br/>
stamp that was perfect for the location. And what a lovely view from <br/>
that spot. The Finger Lakes section of upstate NY is a world all its <br/>
own. Thank you JeLyBean.<br/>
