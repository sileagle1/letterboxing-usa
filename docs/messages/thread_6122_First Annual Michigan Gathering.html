Congratulations on really getting Letterboxing going in the beautiful<br/>
state of Michigan.  Your enthusiam will thrill others.<br/>
<br/>
You've heard the Field of Dreams cliche.  Build it and they will come.<br/>
Just throw out the date, get the thing together and folks will show up<br/>
and you'll have hella letterboxing fun meeting folks and sharing<br/>
stories.  We've had a few gatherings in the Pacific NW and whoever can<br/>
show up usually does.<br/>
<br/>
A must for this sort of thing is an event stamp for your gathering.<br/>
This is a one-day stamp to commemorate your special letterboxing<br/>
experience.  Only those who attend will be able to stamp in and cherish<br/>
the memories and capture the stamp image in their personal logbooks.  <br/>
<br/>
I've carved three event stamps before.  One for a gathering in April<br/>
2001.  The event stamp was of Mt. Hood.  One for a gathering when<br/>
LoneMassWolf graced us with his fine presence in November of 2001.  That<br/>
stamp was the silouette of a howling wolf within the outline of the<br/>
state of Oregon.   The one for a sparsely-attended, but delightful get<br/>
together near Seattle in March of this year was a stylized version of<br/>
the Space Needle.  It is really fun to design and carve these stamps in<br/>
anticipation of a REALLY GREAT TIME, which, I hope you have next month. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and enjoy yourselves!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

<br/>
Regarding the event stamp, is it customary for the event organizer just to design a stamp, or does anyone interested in doing so design a stamp and bring it to the event?  I remember seeing an online article with pix on a lbxr from the NE Region's site about a gathering they had there, and there were pix of people making stamps.  Anyone have any idea exactly what tha process was, how materials were handled, etc.?  Sure would appreciate any info/tidbits you can send along.  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
These gatherings are pretty fun and informal.  You, as the organizer of<br/>
the event can carve the event stamp or ask someone you're certain will<br/>
attend to do it if they so desire.  It's a pretty fun deal.  I felt<br/>
honored when I was asked to carve event stamps in the past.<br/>
<br/>
At the gathering that Thom Cheney put together for us in April 2001,<br/>
there was also an Earth Day celebration going on.  It was cool.  He had<br/>
put together blocks of wood with foamcore on it so kids could scratch<br/>
out their own "signature" stamps then head out on the trail to find the<br/>
many boxes that had been placed ahead of time for the event.  He also<br/>
had little thumbnail pigment inkpads so they participants could  stamp<br/>
up and then return them when they got back.  Thom, Der Mad Stamper and I<br/>
sat and manned the table, to provide explainations, help and enthusiasm.<br/>
but we also had our own carving tools and material and were carving away<br/>
during the whole thing.  It was great fun!<br/>
<br/>
Other gatherings (particularly the ones I plot out) revolve around food,<br/>
such as meeting at a buffet pizza joint.  At those not much carving went<br/>
on, but tons of visiting, exchanging stamped images, and checking out<br/>
everybody's logbooks.  I think those events have been fairly successful<br/>
(especially to me, who loves to stuff my face!)  <br/>
<br/>
Back East it looks like they meet at parks or community centers and<br/>
carve, exchange stamps, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...letterboxing gatherings are awesome. You get to match up folks<br/>
with their stamps and find out who they are as human beings and talk<br/>
about finds and placeds and sometimes you can weasel out some hints on<br/>
hard to get boxes.  It is so fun. You guys out in Michigan will really<br/>
enjoy yourselves, I think.<br/>
<br/>
