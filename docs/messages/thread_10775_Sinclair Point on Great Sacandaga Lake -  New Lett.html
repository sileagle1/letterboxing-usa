Sinclair Point on Great Sacandaga Lake Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is to be found just south of the small town of Edinburg, New York in an area that is the southern "gateway" to the Adirondack Mountains. Route 30 passes through here from the New York ThruWay (Interstate 87) up into the heart of the Adirondack Mountains. Edinburg is 6 miles east of the Northville Bridge (just off Route 30) and 1 mile west of the Batchellerville Bridge. These two bridges span two arms of the large Great Sacandaga Lake, which has a shape similar to an old style tobacco pipe with the mouthpiece at the northeastern end.<br/>
<br/>
The Sinclair Point letterbox only involves a short walk, but provides the chance to see a very nice lake vista from a place usually known only by the locals. In the summer, boating is big. Canoeing would be possible from here, but watch for the chop worked up by southwest afternoon winds. In the winter, cross country skiing is good along the shore if the snow is deep; the beach is covered with cobbles and some boulders. <br/>
