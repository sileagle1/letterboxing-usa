(First off, sorry for the earlier blank post)<br/>
<br/>
Another day, another 6 boxes!  We went out at noon today, searching for a few boxes as we try to finish up this area before we head move to Chehalis.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We went 6 for 6 today so I'm a happy camper. Course, I'd still be a happy camper, even if I didn't find anything, cause it was a beautiful day with the family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, we went for the following boxes:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First on the agenda were the dvn2ckr boxes in Dupont, Washington.  Off we went, traveling down I-5 and off to Dupont and the Historic Museum.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We discovered the Hudson Bay Company Beaver Quarter box. Wonderful place for a box and very interesting as well. And the staff was so nice and helpful. Stamped in after figuring out the clues and off we went after signing in the guest book there and donating a few dollars.  I LOVE the hiding place! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Next was the Powder Works box. What a beautiful hidden trail.  We were so thrilled with the location, we almost didn't find the box!  We did though, but I'm sorry to say, we were unable to stamp in the book was thoroughly soaked.  We cleaned and dried as best we could and resealed and replaced, but we were able to get the stamp for our log and we were able to sign the log.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In between, we went for Aryn and Jason's "Whales Love Washington" box. We almost missed the starting point, but stumbled across it, thanks to RayvenMom's sharp eyes. Box in great condition.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On we go to the Fort Nisqually box.  A little hard to decipher at first but we re-read the clues and we discovered our fault and found the box. Box in great shape!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Continuing on to the Wilkes Observatory box, we followed the clues right to the hiding spot, despite what the other finders had written about it! (grin).  Box in excellent shape and so peaceful there, hardly any cars on a Sunday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks dvn2ckr for a wonderful afternoon in the wilds.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We then decided to tackle another Trial-n-Error box and headed off for the Farrell's March box.  We dug and we searched, we scraped and we cursed and finally, after re-reading the clues and starting to understand how this T-n-E fellow works, how his twisted mind functions, we were successful! We found the box in great shape and stamped in, the first ones in over 5 months.  We've got him figured out now!  Wonderful stamp and a beautiful place. Steller's Jay has been logged in and set back in place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since the puppy was beginning to tire, we decided to try and grab on last box so off to Steilacoom we go, to Coromant Point and the "Cold Moon over Puget Sound" letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, imagine this... We've discovered the perfect ruse for 'discrete' letterboxing. We are the proud owners of a brand new puppy to the family, a Labrador Retriever, Sorcha.  Since she is a Lab, we've decided to tell people we meet on the trail, since we also volunteer with Pierce County Search and Rescue, that we are training her to be a Search and Rescue dog and that she is on the trails getting acclimated.  You'd never believe how well it works as she is a ham and when we let her go, she grabs everyone's attentions while I dash off to grab or replace the box we are stamping into. Also helps explain the backpack and the notebook we carry! (grin)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, anyways, we're hiking down the trail, wondering if dvn2ckr's legs are shorter or a heck of a lot longer than mine are, trying to find the hiding place. After a few aborted attempts we discover it, and pull the box, stamping in and finishing everything up when a nice little old lady walking her dogs comes down the trail, and starts talking to us about her dog. Now, Sorcha has only been out once before, and she's just not to sure about other dogs being around her pack and all.  The lady sat there and talked and talked and talked and talked and talked and talked.... (See where I'm going with this?) Finally, we say that we have to go and we turn and head back up the trail walking slowly, waiting for the little old lady, who, at this point, is letting her dogs wander around to go piddle somewhere, so we can replace the box. We waited and waited and finally had to head back up the trail head and wait for another 15 minutes before she came walking back out and headed off home.  I rush back and redeposit the box, hiding it well again and then return to the trail head not a moment to soon, as suddenly, out of nowhere, the Coromant Biker Gang comes roaring out of the trail behind me and nearly run me over as I dive off to the side of the trail.  Imagine my surprise as gang member after gang member roared by mere inches from my face causing me to relive my entire life as I faced certain death....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, of course, what RayvenMom saw seems to be a bit different from what I saw and felt as I was the one that was there, my face mere millimeters from the Wheels of Death as they wove, screaming and cackling manically, around the park and the trail head.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
RayvenMom swears though the three kids on Mopeds were, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A) No where near to me, and <br/>
<br/>
B) Not going over 5 miles an hour as they passed me, all saying 'Excuse Me Sir' as they passed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I, however, beg to differ as she was NOT there, with her face almost getting ground off by the Spokes of Death!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, we found the box and stamped in and returned it. What another beautiful place and an awesome stamp!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On to another glorious day of letterboxing as we discover the beautiful wilderness in our own backyards and allow the b****iness of the mailing lists and the recent posts there in to melt away.  I for one am enjoying this hobby to it's fullest.  I invite you to as well.<br/>

Ok, the "Spokes of Death" have obviously rattled the brains of RayvenDad... We went 7 for 7 boxes today (not 6), the "Bike Gang" that RayvenDad so descriptively ranted on and on about were nothing more than young teens out for a ride on their very SLOW mopeds, (no, he did NOT dive off head first from the trailhead but he did nearly teleport with surprise as they suddenly emerged behind him... could you see this???  RayvenDad, in the blink of an eye, facing first one way and without warning, suddenly is facing the opposite direction and 5 feet away from his starting point!  That's a visual, isn't it??? *evil grin*) and the heat must have baked RayvenDad's brain (though it wasn't above the mid-70's) because that little old lady had ONE dog (not several dogs)!!! *grins*<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it... our day out with our new "search and rescue" puppy and RayvenDad, obviously delirious from the amount of time we have spent on the trails over the past few days, have made it home safe and sound yet again... Once more we have taken a hobby and had fun with it, as it should be!  After all, if a hobby isn't fun, then it's a chore... and I've always said, if a hobby isn't fun, then don't do it!  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy life... it's too short to spend it arguing over semantics...<br/>
