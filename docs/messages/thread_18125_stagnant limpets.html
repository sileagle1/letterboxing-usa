One thing I did to place a HH that was in a largish cylindrical container was to take along a larger freezer ziploc bag, then place the HH AND the new host box inside the freezer bag.  That way whoever found the box would also certainly find the HH.<br/>

late last Fall @ the Avlon box site in Stony Brook, LI.  The HH had it's own box <br/>
and book &amp; stamp pad.  So I stamped the book sent it to NH with my daughter to <br/>
the RoseMary's Shower letterbox site.  I did note it on this talk list.  <br/>
Being so close to the cold and snowy time of the year I don't think anyone found <br/>
it yet.  My daughters will be together in NH the end of the month and they will <br/>
check the site then.  Is that what I was suppose to do?  If the HH is still <br/>
there, should we leave it there or move it once more?  If so, we will move it <br/>
back to LI., NYor somewhere near Putnam, CT around Easter.<br/>
