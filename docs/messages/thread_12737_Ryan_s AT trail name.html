Other AT hikers are calling him Green Turtle because he stamps into <br/>
all the log books with his signature stamp which is a green turtle. <br/>
Some folks said he was traveling too fast to be a turtle and thought <br/>
he should be a Hare instead. But actually, he is just plodding along <br/>
and not taking any breaks. (just one zero day so far) So he actually <br/>
is like the tortoise.  Most folks on the trail take time off quite <br/>
frequently. One fellow who is actually hiking faster than Ryan <br/>
jokingly called him The Snail while we were in Hot Springs, NC! :-)<br/>

&gt; A while back I suggested his trail name should be Box Turtle, but <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; sure if he is using it.<br/>
&gt; I'll pick July 4th.<br/>
