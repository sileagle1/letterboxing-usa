in Calif. but none are through the woods! <br/>
<br/>
Found box #2 first, though quite waterlogged. Tried to dry it out as best we <br/>
could on a gray, misty day. It's a 5-sided stamp worth the easy hunt! Also <br/>
found #1 which was in fine shape. Unfortunately, it was getting too late to <br/>
go for #3 so can't report on that one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun!<br/>
