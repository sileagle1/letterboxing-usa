                    <html><body>Just a thought on the subject of trash in parks...<br/>
<br/>
I went out walking today (in the rain!) and was truly saddened by all the trash I saw.  I threw away a styrofoam tray that once held raw chicken wings.  Why this was on the ground in the middle of a beautiful park, I can't even hazard a guess.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Binghamton, NY - an area that proclaims itself to be "The Carousel Capital of the World."  Between 1919 and 1934, George Johnson (of Endicott Johnson Shoes) donated 6 carousels to the area.  They are still there, in all their beautiful antique glory.<br/>
<br/>
I remember as a child that each carousel had a huge sign reading "ADMISSION: One piece of litter."  What a bargain!  I lived one block from one of the carousels and I rode it every day.  That was one extremely clean park where it was located!  There were days when it was extremely difficult to find the price of admission!  And I am pleased to discover that they still hold true to this today.  It was important to George Johnson that no money be collected for children to enjoy the magic of his carousels.<br/>
<br/>
I think perhaps we should carry this into our letterboxing.  "ADMISSION: one piece of litter."  Even if we all pick up just one piece of litter, the parks we visit will be just a little bit cleaner because of us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening to my rainy day ramblings....<br/>

With as much trash as I've seen out there, it'll be a cinch getting to any <br/>
letterbox that this has happened with.....just follow the clean spots right <br/>
to the box....<br/>
<br/>
Sad, really.<br/>

That's terrible! : (  Are most of the parks like that or just a few?  <br/>
Thankfully we haven't come across one near as bad as that - just the <br/>
odd litter here and there.  <br/>
