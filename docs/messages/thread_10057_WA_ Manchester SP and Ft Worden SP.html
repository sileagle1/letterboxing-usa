Errors Manchester SP boxes (3)<br/>
<br/>
I ventured out without my compass today.  Foolish when tackling a T <br/>
and E box.<br/>
<br/>
The second box required to select a tree on a given bearing.  I used <br/>
the sun and guessed and found.  Trying to remember that degree value <br/>
I tackled the last box, which required a triangulation.  I had two <br/>
possible spots and a distant third.  The first spot was a no go ( and <br/>
too "public" for digging around IMHO).  I looked at the clue sheet <br/>
and at my second spot and BINGO.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most cunning placements I have found to date!<br/>
<br/>
I drove on to Ft Worden and am sorry to report that all of the boxes <br/>
placed by Candlelight and Amanda from Seattle are gone.  I have <br/>
written both privately and I am sure they will check ( or take my <br/>
word for it)  This venue is far flung and required a bit of driving.  <br/>
Those coming from the Seattle area would likely encounter a ferry <br/>
toll.  I would encourage folks to check with the placers before <br/>
tackling this venue.  The park is very nice with wonderful views of <br/>
the Straight of Juan de Fuca and plenty of bird action.<br/>
<br/>
But no boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The drive home was glorious with one of our rosey sunset in winter <br/>
afternoons.  I even briefly glimpsed Mt St Helen's , her snow lit <br/>
just right in the far distance.<br/>

<br/>
Amanda told me that her boxes were pulled by the authorities there.  <br/>
She got an e-mail a little while box from them saying as much and <br/>
what to do if she wanted to reclaim them.  (She has no plans to, as <br/>
far as I know.)  <br/>
<br/>
While I never heard anything about Candlelight's boxes, presumeably <br/>
they've pulled her boxes as well and she's already aware of their <br/>
status.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else planning to hide boxes at Fort Worden would be advised to <br/>
make them mystery boxes or not post the clues to this website.  It's <br/>
an awesome place to visit, and it's a shame not have anymore boxes <br/>
there.  Letterboxing at Fort Worden will have to go 'underground'.<br/>

One less reason to buy an annual state park parking pass...and we <br/>
were just about to write out our check!!!<br/>
<br/>
Drat, that was a great series of boxes there.  I wonder why they <br/>
pulled them.  It definitely was the only reason we went to visit <br/>
that park since it's about halfway to nowhere around the peninsula.  <br/>
Without letterboxing, we wouldn't have even known that park <br/>
existed.  Those boxes were placed in locations that didn't, in any <br/>
possible way, damage/threaten the environment or detract from the <br/>
park.  This makes me want to scream!!!  ARGHH!!!!!!!!!<br/>
