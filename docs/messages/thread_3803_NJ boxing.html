<br/>We were able to stamp in at the Ringwood Letterbox which, by the way, was not an easy hike, but very easy to follow because the white trail had been recently re-blazed.
<br/>
<br/>We completed the Down Under Series and wish to thanks Wingfoot for placing it there. It's one of those spots so close to home that we'd never consider getting up off the couch and going for a quick hike at that location if there weren't a treasure to find. 
<br/>
<br/>And finally, we found the Northern New Jersey Mystery (1).  Super!
<br/>
<br/>Thanks, all, I love this stuff.

Glad to hear you enjoyed the Down Under Series, I lived in Wayne many <br/>
years before I even knew about that area.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulation on finding my mystery box, by the way, were you the <br/>
first?<br/>

<br/>Wingfoot, no we weren't the first, but we were the second.  We can't for the life of us remember who stamped in before us, though,
<br/>
<br/>Today we visited Mountainside.  Needless to say, this is another place near home I'd never have visited, nor even know existed if I weren't searching for treasure.  
<br/>
<br/>The contents of the box was very damp, as if it had been opened during the rain and things were put away wet.  We replaced the notebook's zip lock bag which was fairly wet; I think it will be fine.  The tree by which the box is hidden seems to be a favorite of bears.  Now I'm no expert, but the stuff by the trunk looked like bear scat to me, and the tree's bark looked as though it had been a scratching post for <i>something</i> big.  If nothing else, it made our hike back to the car a little more exciting. :)
<br/>
<br/>Thanks, again, I love having all these boxes so close to home.
