&lt;&lt; There is no certain way to know any box is there at any given <br/>
time. However, I think that status updates by the box owner would be <br/>
very helpful. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a good point Eric, and I think this talk list is the perfect place to <br/>
post such updates.  The keyword search that I mentioned earlier makes it <br/>
possible to type in the name of a box and access all communications regarding <br/>
it.  This is the best way I know to find out the latest reports from the <br/>
field, as well as reports from the original author of the clues.  It requires <br/>
a little bit of research, but that can be a good thing if it keeps vandals <br/>
from feeling like they are gaining notoriety for their misdeeds.  It's all <br/>
part of the challenge of the hunt!!<br/>
<br/>
Any time a box is found, the finder will be doing a great service to the <br/>
entire letterboxing community by either contacting the author of the box or <br/>
posting a note about their find on this list.  Post cards are great, although <br/>
I just simply include my email address (in several locations) within the box.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, (not always) when one of my boxes is reported missing, I post a <br/>
note indicating this on the clue page. However, this is a personal choice. <br/>
Those who do not maintain their own clue pages, but instead have had one of <br/>
the Webmasters create a complimentary clue page for them, will likely find <br/>
that the Webmasters are more than willing to add such notations if asked <br/>
nicely.    :o)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, if anyone is considering a letterbox outing in the Portland area, <br/>
I always welcome personal correspondence and will do my best to provide the <br/>
latest info about which boxes are rumored to be missing.  Perhaps we can even <br/>
arrange to meet over a pint at a local pub....<br/>
<br/>
Rather than publish info online about missing boxes, I would rather encourage <br/>
this sort of personal communication.<br/>

Now this is a matter of personal choice.  Not to mention the list<br/>
volume this would generate, I think keeping silent is more fun.<br/>
Keep some secrecy going.  I think its cool to go out in the _field_<br/>
and discover who has visited your box rather than a e-mail to the<br/>
whole world.  I certainly never send notes when I find boxes for<br/>
this reason (except once in a while a personal note to the author,<br/>
or a very cryptic note that only those with ears to hear will pick<br/>
up on :-)).  Its just more fun this way.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem with this is it can give away mystery boxes.  If <br/>
I say "wow, I found mystery box X", that gives away to the astute<br/>
more information about the box then they otherwise would have had.<br/>
Its a spoiler.  These things matter to the people hunting and hiding<br/>
these boxes.  All someone would have to do is look at the USOF A <br/>
meet schedule to see where the mystery boxes be in my case :-)<br/>
<br/>
Its interesting that the armchair treasure hunting folks will<br/>
actually try to backdoor finds by researching travel itineraries,<br/>
etc, of the hiders.  The hiders have to make bogus travel plans and<br/>
trips to avoid this.  Its interesting how much can be given away<br/>
by these comments when playing at the cryptic box level.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I've backdoored a couple of boxes myself due to <br/>
careless comments on this list.  I wonder how many I've given away ...<br/>
<br/>
Loose lips sink ships :-)<br/>
