                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is great news!  I only wish I would have had more time to find these and some of the other old boxes while in Vermont.  Through the years as I have found boxes by some of the early placers (e.g. Der Mad Stamper in Oregon, Idaho &amp; Kansas, and Eoghan in TX), I am constantly amazed at how well they were done.  Not only do they contain nice carvings with clever clues, but most have survived the test of time, which allows future letterboxers the chance to experience a piece of history.  Thanks for setting the bar so high and providing excellent examples for future placers.<br/>

Thanks for checking on those boxes, Tom. I hope our conversation didn't require you to make those hikes! Glad to finally meet you, appreciate you showing up at the event and glad those early boxes are still there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sue &amp; I will contact you when we're in the area. Nice to see you "back" (to our roots!) <br/>
