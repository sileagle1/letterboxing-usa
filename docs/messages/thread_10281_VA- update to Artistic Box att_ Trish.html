<div>I wouldn't have believed it, but, Mary was right, the trash can that was cemented into the ground and held with two large wood stantions was dug up and removed a couple days after I used it as a landmark.  For some odd reason, they replanted it a couple of feet closer on the left of the sidewalk (cemented in with big wooden 4x4's....)  (Vienna taxpayer dollars at work....)</div>
