his own Travelling Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox has a separate Clue book, which is placed in a host box.<br/>
The Traveller is then hidden very nearby.<br/>
If you find the Clue, you must find the box. If you don't find the box,<br/>
then leave the clue in it's host for another.<br/>
<br/>
Since Peter McGuire was never lonely, even when economically destitute,<br/>
we'd like it if he where not left alone too long. With that in mind, we<br/>
give you this hint: his first host is one of the Drew Clan's 300+ boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great Labor Day!!!<br/>
