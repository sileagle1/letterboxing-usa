San Luis Obispo County last week, I inadvertantly cheated you out of <br/>
a piece of the puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
It went like this: One morning I removed the parasitic piece I found <br/>
in my Totem Pole Box, where you had not been, and I placed it, (as I <br/>
was allowed and encouraged to do by the instructions given,) in <br/>
another of my boxes that you had already visited.  The next day, <br/>
realizing by a number of clues that you had been making a grand sweep <br/>
of the area, I re-checked the Totem Pole box, and- yep, you had been <br/>
there after I moved the chaos.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize- I would not have picked that time to move the chaos if I <br/>
had known you were prowling the area. I guess that's what Pandora <br/>
means by "chaos"....  I was particularly excited to see your stamps <br/>
in the books, because your "Gull in the Sky" box was the third box I <br/>
ever found, and I am a fan of it and "Shadey Coyote" and your <br/>
additions to the Critters of Ennisbrook series.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you purchased any books during your afternoon visit to the <br/>
bookstore, you very likely purchased them from me.<br/>

  Not to worry. Since we didn't know the piece was there previously <br/>
we were clueless. Chaos Reigns ! Don<br/>
