Men was very, very special. We climbed when it was still dark <br/>
(love my headlamp) and then enjoyed their dancing as the sun <br/>

great to meet Churchill and Moonshine from RI. We did the two <br/>
boxes on that trail, had breakfast with the celebrators and I also <br/>
had time to do the Little Dam series. All were dry and in fine <br/>
shape. Later Butterfly and I got to 2 of the DEP boxes. All before it <br/>
rained! Next year, maybe more boxers will make the early <br/>
morning climb! Bluebird<br/>

We had really wanted to do this, and feal bad for missing it however <br/>
the NyQuil I was on didn't let me out of bed 'till almost 0900 hrs.  <br/>
I'm fealling somewhat better today, and Amy and I are hoping to get <br/>
to go next year.  We did get to do two drive-ups much later in the <br/>
day, but there was no way I could have done any real walking <br/>
yesterday.  Again we are sorry that we missed it.<br/>
Patrick and Amy<br/>
