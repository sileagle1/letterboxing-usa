<br/>
Hope you all are sporting your LbNA logos! I have about 6 extra <br/>
patches if anyone is interested. <br/>
<br/>
Vic and I planted our first box last month; it is in a beautiful <br/>
location in South Jersey. You could walk these gorgeous woods on the <br/>
way to Cape May, Wildwood or Atlantic City!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
"SWAMP THING" LETTERBOX"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Estell Manor Park in Mays Landing, NJ is about 30 minutes west of <br/>
Atlantic City, part of the Atlantic County Park system. There are <br/>
numerous points of interest within its boundaries, including the <br/>
foundation ruins of an old World War I munitions factory, an old <br/>
glassworks site, a playground, boat launch, nature center, and <br/>
observation deck. So wander the woods and enjoy the trails as you <br/>
seek the box (then perhaps head to the beach or the casino!)<br/>
<br/>
ESTELL MANOR PARK, 109 Rte. 50, Mays Landing NJ<br/>
<br/>
Rating: EASY  2.5 - 3 miles, flat terrain<br/>
<br/>
Placed: February, 2001 <br/>
<br/>
Note: A park trail map is recommended, but not necessary. (Available <br/>
at the nature center.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Park at the Nature Center, and begin on the asphalt path to your left <br/>
as you face the front of the building. Take the path at 160 degrees <br/>
and pass the now-extinct Katsura tree on your right.<br/>
<br/>
Soon you'll pass over a small wooden bridge. At the fork, bear 210. <br/>
At the next fork, turn left 115 degrees east onto the LAUREL TRAIL.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the Laurel Trail, passing post #'s 9, 10, 7, and 11 as you <br/>
weave through beautiful mountain laurel, longleaf pine, and huge <br/>
American Holly. When it intersects at a "T" with the CENTER TRAIL, <br/>
turn left here 60 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
This isn't quite Atlantic City's Boardwalk, but it will guide you <br/>
safely through this maple swamp. Beware of trolls under the bridge!<br/>
<br/>
As you cross the road, stay straight on the trail. Note the name <br/>
changes to "MISTLETOE". Resist the urge to take the large fork on the <br/>
right as it comes up. Stay your course and keep a sharp eye out for a <br/>
small sign on your left (on a tree): "TO FOOTBRIDGE". Take this trail <br/>
on your left at 15 degrees. This bridge will keep you out of mud and <br/>
muck!<br/>
<br/>
Have your arrived at the Sandhole Road signboard? At this junction, <br/>
choose the trail on your far right; the SWAMP TRAIL at 140 degrees. <br/>
There will be other trails too; just keep right (see a "211" sign on <br/>
tree as landmark.) You're headed for another boardwalk!<br/>
<br/>
As you amble along the boards, enjoy the cedars and pitch pine, <br/>
sweetgum, and maple. What you seek is not far ahead!<br/>
<br/>
The boardwalk soon bends to a 15 degree angle. The Swamp Thing lives <br/>
under here, just by your left foot! LOOK AROUND  is anyone coming? <br/>
If the coast is clear, hop off the boards and reach underneath. The <br/>
box rests on a support beam at the edge. Congratulations! Stamp in!<br/>
<br/>
GETTING BACK: You can always retrace the way you came, but why not <br/>
make a circuit and enjoy the ruins, the river, the cemetery, and more?<br/>
<br/>
Continue along the boardwalk to the end (do NOT fork off to the left <br/>
at the new signboard). Pass marker #234 and come to a "T". Go left  <br/>
(due west) and explore the old Powerhouse ruins, artesian well and <br/>
Smith-Ireland cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
You'll come upon a large clearing and campfire area. Take the trail <br/>
at about 230 degrees on left. Follow this to another "T" and turn <br/>
left again heading south. You should be on the OAK RIDGE TRAIL. <br/>
Continue along Oak Ridge and cross the Eagle footbridge. Soon after, <br/>
there will be a cut in the boardwalk on your right.  Turn right here <br/>
onto FROG POND ROAD. (You'll soon see signs confirming you are on the <br/>
right track).<br/>
<br/>
When Frog Pond intersects with another large sand road (NORTH END <br/>
ROAD) turn left here and follow this road directly back to your car <br/>
and the nature center.<br/>
<br/>

respect to his or her personal abilities and <br/>
limitations. "Letterboxing North America" and the individual <br/>
letterbox sponsors assume no liability for events which may occur <br/>
