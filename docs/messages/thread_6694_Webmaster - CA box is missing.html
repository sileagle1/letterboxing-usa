I recently went looking for the "Leafy" box in San Francisco's Golden Gate<br/>
park - unsuccessfully.  The clues were clear and led us to a spot where we<br/>
were sure something *used* to be hidden, but no box was found.  There were<br/>
some trees that had been planted up to within a few feet of the hiding spot,<br/>
so we wondered if the box had been discovered and removed.<br/>
<br/>
The clues page didn't have contact info for the people who placed the box.<br/>
Can those clues be updated or removed?<br/>
<br/>
I'm new to this list, but happy to know it exists.  Are there any other<br/>
Central California letterboxers lurking here?  I live in Santa Cruz County,<br/>
and have found that my area is woefully light of boxes...there is one in the<br/>
entire county!  That will soon change....<br/>
