Hey, you guys could all switch over to the campground that allows dogs, and<br/>
bring yours too :)<br/>

I called Rocky Neck SP and they verified it: no dogs welcome in the<br/>
campground. Personally, I can't see the reasoning...but it's the<br/>
government. There is a private campground right across the street, so<br/>
we'll try and get the name and see if anything's available. The other<br/>
option would be the Drew Family dogsitting service. Our lab would love<br/>
some company!<br/>

Kimberly, the campground across the street is called "Camp Niantic by <br/>
the Atlantic," and although I keep getting their answering machine <br/>
the phone number is (860)739-9308. It's one of those places where <br/>
people keep their campers for a whole season, but I've heard they do <br/>
have short stay campsites as well. Wish they would pick up the phone! <br/>
I'll try and stop by this weekend if I don't get them on the phone <br/>
and see if it's nice and if they have room for us and our K9s. And <br/>
we're serious, if you'd like your pup to "sleep over" with ours, we'd <br/>
be glad to have him for the night. He could still romp with you on <br/>
the hikes during the day! But since our lab will also be banished <br/>
from the camping, he'd enjoy the company.<br/>
