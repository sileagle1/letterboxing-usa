LbNA counts our finds for us, but the count is frequently wrong.  It <br/>
does not count Hitchhikers, unlisted boxes, or deleted boxes.  If we <br/>
had a "correct the count" counter somewhere we could scroll down to <br/>
the number of boxes to add and, our count would be corrected.<br/>

could be used for this; but everyone who used it would mess up their <br/>
mystery box count.  It would also ruin my "boxes placed" count.<br/>
<br/>
I am aware that boxers with 250 plus finds would not find this <br/>
useful, but it would be great for most of us, who have "normal" <br/>
numbers of finds.<br/>

The new counter would be like the "Mystery Box" counter, but would <br/>
be, for example, a "Correct the Count" counter.  If we wanted to get <br/>
fancy, we could have a separate one for Hitchhikers, etc.  Another <br/>

placed and then deleted, to correct our "Placed" count (it could also <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am a counter. I wish that the LbNA counting mechanism would allow us<br/>
to record and count unlisted boxes, as does Atlasquest.<br/>
<br/>
While I keep my "pencil" count as my official count, I find<br/>
record-keeping on the web very useful because it allows searching<br/>
according to different criteria such as date found, name of planter,<br/>
geographical location, etc.  It also enables looking up Found boxes on<br/>
the web so that if one lives in Toledo but happens to be in Seattle,<br/>
the records are available. <br/>
<br/>
What would be really great is to have a counting system that allows<br/>
the finders to tailor their counts. For example, some would like to<br/>
count hitchhikers as Finds. I don't; I count them separately, but, if<br/>
someone wished to include hitchhikers in their Find counts, they<br/>
should be able to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Technically, allowing user-tailoring would be possible via<br/>
check-boxes, radio buttons, and text boxes. The issue probably would<br/>
be where in the list of priorities writing the program would come for<br/>
the volunteer webmasters; who determines those priorities; how much<br/>
time is involved; and whether or not the webmasters have the<br/>
programming skills and tools required.  The issue should NOT be<br/>
whether counting is good, moral, or healthy. LbNA's stance would well<br/>
be allowing different strokes for different folks and letting the user<br/>
determine how they want to be stroked.<br/>

<br/>
Ever heard of a pencil and paper?  Or just using your own computer?  Or just<br/>
number each stamp in your logbook/journal/scrapbook?<br/>
<br/>
I do count my finds in a way.  But only because I list them in a Word<br/>
document on my own computer so that I know which ones I've already found and<br/>
which ones I haven't yet found.  So when I'm listing them, I do list them as<br/>
1. 2. 3. 4. etc.  I type the name of the box, and the county and state that<br/>
I found it in, and the date that I found it.  This is strictly because,<br/>
since the blessed event of menopause began, my memory is rather shot at<br/>
times and I don't want to traipse after the same box three times, find it,<br/>
and say "oh yeah!  I remember here before." :-)<br/>
<br/>
(Doesn't the LbNA website counting become a problem anyway sometimes with a<br/>
"series" of boxes?  Many people place a series but then only put a logbook<br/>
in the last box.  According to what I was told, and maybe that's wrong, I<br/>
dunno, it's only a "Find" if the box has a logbook.  Thus a series of 6<br/>
boxes with only 1 logbook at the end, only counts as 1 "Find", not six.  Or<br/>
is a person able to list only 1 Find even if LbNA shows it as six boxes?)<br/>
<br/>
But the whole idea of people getting into such a tither and lather about<br/>
numbers is just a total turnoff to me.  One of the things I really liked<br/>
about the LbNA website when I first found it a few years ago was it's<br/>
simplicity.<br/>
<br/>
To each his own I guess.  But you asked for opinions.  That's mine.<br/>

To answer the question that was brought up many times:<br/>
<br/>
I DO have a pencil count in my logbook.  When that count does not match the LbNA count I know that, most likely, I have missed logging a find on LbNA.  The two counts keep each other honest.  <br/>
OK - I give up - poll results noted.<br/>

I wonder if there was a way to offer a service that<br/>
takes into account both aspects...the people who want<br/>
to know the history/stats of a letterbox and those who<br/>
do not.<br/>
<br/>
Could the stats/history be hidden from those members<br/>
who do not wish to know what the history is. Could<br/>
they set up their profile to exclude history info when<br/>
looking at a clue? Or could we have a button on each<br/>
clue that LBers could click on if they want to see the<br/>
history?<br/>
<br/>
This way those LBers who like to know who's visited<br/>
and when the visits took place will have that option<br/>
and those who don't would never click on the<br/>
history/statistics button.<br/>

(and a 6 month old), and he cried the one time we went looking for a<br/>
letterbox that was missing.  He doesn't quite understand adventure in<br/>
that sense.  He enjoys hiking along and being guided to find the box,<br/>
as well as stamping and rehiding.  I like knowing that a box has been<br/>
recently found so I know it's a fairly safe bet for my little guy.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you worried about being discreet finding/hiding boxes,<br/>
you're right, preschoolers are anything but quiet, but we're able to<br/>
box on weekdays and have yet to see anyone else out there.  Anytime<br/>
you want to rehide a box well, ask your three year old if he can see<br/>
any plastic!  :)<br/>

map on the wall to show the letterboxes we've found or know about but<br/>
haven't found yet. The website isn't the letterboxing, it's just a tool.<br/>
<br/>
Choi<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I wonder if there was a way to offer a service that<br/>
&gt; takes into account both aspects...the people who want<br/>
&gt; to know the history/stats of a letterbox and those who<br/>
&gt; do not.<br/>

On the flip side of that, I go letterboxing with my three year old<br/>
(and a 6 month old), and he cried the one time we went looking for a<br/>
letterbox that was missing.  He doesn't quite understand adventure in<br/>
that sense.  He enjoys hiking along and being guided to find the box,<br/>
as well as stamping and rehiding.  I like knowing that a box has been<br/>
recently found so I know it's a fairly safe bet for my little guy.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you worried about being discreet finding/hiding boxes,<br/>
you're right, preschoolers are anything but quiet, but we're able to<br/>
box on weekdays and have yet to see anyone else out there.  Anytime<br/>
you want to rehide a box well, ask your three year old if he can see<br/>
any plastic!  :)<br/>

&gt; My personal take on this takes me back a couple of years to when I<br/>
&gt; had just started. I looked on LbNA and was excited to see that a<br/>
&gt; letterbox existed 50 miles from me. I drove over there and felt the<br/>
&gt; excitement build as I hiked the 3 miles up to a beautiful waterfall.<br/>
&gt; The letterbox had been placed three years before and I was hoping<br/>
&gt; that I could find it since I had only found one other letterbox.<br/>
&gt; After reading the compass and going through my paces I was ecstatic<br/>
&gt; to find the thing intact. Then, when I read the journal, I was amazed<br/>
&gt; to see that I was the first finder of a three year-old letterbox! If<br/>
&gt; we could see the "last found" and "history" options back then, I<br/>
&gt; would have already known that it hadn't been found and the experience<br/>
&gt; would have suffered for it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; More information about the treasure = less adventure. I understand<br/>
&gt; that some would rather have success than adventure, and I know the<br/>
&gt; features are here to stay. I'm just glad there are curmudgeons out<br/>
&gt; there that don't enter their data.<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">A lot often gets said on the list as to the fact that "it's all about <br/>
the hike" and the fact that the searcher is being taken someplace <br/>
that the placer finds truly beautiful and special and wants to <br/>
share.  Thus counts shouldn't be thought about or maybe drive-by <br/>
boxes should be discouraged.  And parents have brought up the point <br/>
about how disappointed children can be at not finding a box.  <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to bring up two points: <br/>
<br/>
1.  In all fairness to boxers who don't necessarily feel that it's <br/>
all about the hike............the above just isn't true for a good <br/>
many placed boxes so even tho I detest what I term "all the counting <br/>
crap", I can understand why some people use other criteria for their <br/>
boxing drive or mentality.  <br/>
<br/>
In my neck of the woods, some boxes are placed where there's a really <br/>
pretty river to take in, or a nifty statue to see, or a cute little <br/>
waterfall, or a swinging bridge in a city with more curved streets <br/>
than I've ever seen in my entire life so the search is a cool <br/>
experience, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
But a good many boxes are placed in those good ol' neighborhood parks <br/>
that we all have in our towns and that there's nothing <br/>
exactly "special" about in the least.  Or along bike paths where if <br/>
you've-seen-one-set-of-woods, you've-seen-'em-all type of thing.  And <br/>
if there *is* something special about it to the placer, it's rarely <br/>
stated in the clues for the searcher to be able to understand why <br/>
that particular site was picked. <br/>
<br/>
In other words, for the searcher, maybe there's nothing either <br/>
stimulating or challenging to make someone want to search for *that* <br/>
particular box.  Other than for a unique stamp, or to up their F-<br/>
count, etc.<br/>
<br/>
2.  I do think, tho, for children, that not finding a box is a good <br/>
lesson in the fact that that's what happens in real life.  I guess <br/>
maybe if I had a kid that I just absolutely didn't want to see <br/>
disappointed, I'd make up a box to carry with me and quickly hide it <br/>
at the site just so that the child would "find" something.  Change to <br/>
a new little store-bought stamp each time.  Put some fake stamps in <br/>
the logbook with some fake signatures and dates?  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
But I think it's a valuable lesson for a child to learn.  If they're <br/>
old enough to understand that they're on a treasure hunt, and that <br/>
there's something exciting that might be found, it seems to me like <br/>
they're old enough to understand that sometimes they're going to <br/>
disappointed at the end of the search.  That's what a treasure hunt <br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
I used to traipse after my mother on some of her archeological digs <br/>
when I was quite young, and I can remember sharing in both the agony <br/>
and the ecstasy of the adults, even tho I was too young at the <br/>
beginning to really care much about or understand the history behind <br/>
what everyone was looking for.  It was a great lesson seeing my <br/>
mother sometimes ecstatic and seeing her sometimes disappointed yet, <br/>
if disappointed, always bouncing back and getting right back into <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
I've also seen some parents put (in my opinion)<br/>
too much emphasis on the finding of the box.  As if they're using <br/>
that as a bribe to get the child to go on the hike/search in the <br/>
first place.  "Look little Johhny!  Look Little Suzy! If you'll agree <br/>
to come with us, you'll get to find a treasure box at the end!"  So <br/>
that when that box is missing, the child feels lied to which adds to <br/>
the disappointment and to the severity of the temper tantrum.  Maybe <br/>
being a little more low-key in the beginning of the trip might help, <br/>
and not treating the letterbox as a sort of bribe.  Maybe something <br/>
more along the lines of "We're going over to play in this here park <br/>
and along with other things we'll be doing, we're going to be <br/>
following a map which *might* lead us to a little treasure."  <br/>
<br/>
In other words, take the seeming "choice" for the trip out of the <br/>
child's hands.  No choice, no need for a bribe?             <br/>

Thanks for the idea about hiding a pretend box, but he never seems to<br/>
fall for tricks like that here at home!  :)  I wish he had the stamina<br/>
so that we could just look for a second one, but that will come with<br/>
time.  Those drive by boxes that take people 20 minutes to reach take<br/>
us at least an hour in and almost that much back, but that's not<br/>
helped by his fascination with sticks, stones, and anything else that<br/>
might be on the trail.  We've currently got a bumper crop of mushrooms<br/>
in the area....<br/>

this past week i introduced 2 friends to LB<br/>

Provincetown MA and went up and down 3 staircases searching for LONG <br/>
POND LB (last find Apr 05)in Wellfleet MA and did not find either one<br/>
<br/>
luckily i had also printed out the clues to the LITTLE MERMAID LB <br/>
(noted that it had been found 04OCT05) in Wellfleet MA  great <br/>
imaginative clues and IT WAS THERE with a BONUS LB too<br/>
<br/>
so the day was a success and now there are two more LB enthusiasts <br/>
in CT   but they were a little leery about this hobby until we FOUND <br/>
one<br/>
<br/>
so i am grateful that i had printed out all three and for the found <br/>

As a hider of 23 boxes I try to check my boxes at<br/>

check. If I find it I'll post a note to the page that<br/>
it's still there. Only one of my letterboxes that I've<br/>
posted on the letterboxing sites has gone missing and<br/>
I replaced it within a few days and posted notes. I<br/>
feel it's part of my responsibility to maintain the<br/>
box.  <br/>

As I hider I don't want to disappoint people (young,<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I've also seen some parents put (in my opinion)<br/>
&gt; too much emphasis on the finding of the box.  As if they're using <br/>
&gt; that as a bribe to get the child to go on the hike/search in the <br/>
&gt; first place.  "Look little Johhny!  Look Little Suzy! If you'll agree <br/>
&gt; to come with us, you'll get to find a treasure box at the end!"  So <br/>
&gt; that when that box is missing, the child feels lied to which adds to <br/>
&gt; the disappointment and to the severity of the temper tantrum.  Maybe <br/>
&gt; being a little more low-key in the beginning of the trip might help, <br/>
&gt; and not treating the letterbox as a sort of bribe.  Maybe something <br/>
&gt; more along the lines of "We're going over to play in this here park <br/>
&gt; and along with other things we'll be doing, we're going to be <br/>
&gt; following a map which *might* lead us to a little treasure."  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In other words, take the seeming "choice" for the trip out of the <br/>
&gt; child's hands.  No choice, no need for a bribe?             <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the idea about hiding a pretend box, but he never seems <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; fall for tricks like that here at home!  :)  I wish he had the <br/>
stamina<br/>
&gt; so that we could just look for a second one, but that will come <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; time.  Those drive by boxes that take people 20 minutes to reach <br/>
take<br/>
&gt; us at least an hour in and almost that much back, but that's not<br/>
&gt; helped by his fascination with sticks, stones, and anything else <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; might be on the trail.  We've currently got a bumper crop of <br/>
mushrooms<br/>
&gt; in the area....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think perhaps your son isn't ready for the 'work' of letterboxing. <br/>
Three years old is very young, and any child's attention span at <br/>
that age is quite short. Perhaps you could put less emphasis on the <br/>
quest for the box (for him), and more on the joy of finding sticks <br/>
and mushrooms. You could still seek boxes, possibly choosing ones <br/>
that are less challenging in terms of time and terrain, and allow <br/>
him to enjoy the trek in his own way.<br/>
Letterboxing is the kind of activity that one needs to choose, and <br/>
if it isn't his choice, you'll sour him on it. Your enthusiasm for <br/>
the sport is more likely to be contagious if he chooses to <br/>
participate when he feels ready.<br/>
That being said, when I place my boxes, i keep families in mind. I <br/>
make the clues quite easy, place the box close to the trail, and <br/>
make certain that the terrain is easy walking. Two of my good <br/>
friends are 'boxers, one an above the knee amputee, one with a <br/>
seizure disorder, and both with service dogs. I always have them in <br/>
mind when i place boxes.  <br/>
i find it gratifying to read i the logbook that someone's three year <br/>
old found the box, or that it was a families first find. <br/>

It's the nature of the web. Some think it's for the<br/>
better some don't. Those who prefer the simplest form<br/>
can still use the LBNA site in that manner. <br/>
<br/>
As Choi pointed out in an earlier message about the<br/>
site:<br/>
<br/>
"There are already preferences for those that don't<br/>
want to get into the find<br/>
history info. There's one setting to disable letterbox<br/>

your boxes and another to disable letterbox status<br/>

<br/>
Letterboxers aren't forced to use the status function.<br/>
Those who want to can. It shouldn't have a negative<br/>
affect on those who don't.<br/>

We discuss these on our local chat list to see if anyone has any info re:the placer. I also have to agree with Springchick re: LBNA. While I think Choi and all of the webmasters have done a great job and work very hard to give (most) people what they want, I really don't like counters, flags, etc. I have disabled the status display for my boxes. If fewer people hunt them I am fine with that, that's certainly their choice. I am grateful that at least I have that choice. I don't use Atlasquest much either, although it's a fine site, I don't feel like doing alll of the work that one could do one there if they were into counting everything electronically. My boxes are listed there for those folks who prefer that site but I'll never log my finds. That's too much like work. I just jot down numbers once or twice a year in my log book to get a feel for where I'm at.<br/>
 I do understand I am in the minority and lot's of folks enjoy the high tech approach to letterboxing, I'm just not one of them. I also think it's healthy to not be successful now and then when hunting a box. We must learn how to handle disappointment without letting it ruin our day. When I first started boxing I had a lousy hunt/find ratio but it was in the failures I built my skill set. I also feel I learned how to enjoy the simple pleasure of just being outside and not let a little disappointment ruin my day. For me, letterboxing is best in it's simplest form. JMHO<br/>
