14 <br/>
letterboxes in Cherokee County to the new webpage.  Nice setup for <br/>
posting and editing boxes.  Our thanks to the webmaster.<br/>
<br/>
I'm delighted that letterboxing seems to be "taking off" in Georgia.  <br/>
My thanks to all of you who are putting out boxes...we'll be visiting <br/>
some over the summer.<br/>
<br/>
Transferring images to carving material: I noted that many of you<br/>
seem <br/>
to be using acetone to transfer stamp images. I've used it with mixed <br/>
results.  I invite you to try the following which may, or may not<br/>
work <br/>
for you.<br/>
<br/>
With an ink jet printer, print the image on a sheet of clear acetate <br/>
film.  place the image over the carving material and rub it firmly.  <br/>
The image should transfer well since the ink will not adhere to the <br/>
plastic.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that this works well with an HP830C printer, but less <br/>
well with a Xerox M940.  It may be the difference in ink formulations <br/>
or printer heads.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to all of you for a good year of letterboxing.<br/>

Maybe it's not right to give away the location, but I want it to get on it's way.  :)<br/>
