Rules and regulations vary from state to state, so make sure you are <br/>
not caught with it by an officer of the law unless you have a Federal <br/>
Identification Card that says that you are legal to carry it.  You <br/>
can obtain the license for just chemical propellant from your local <br/>
police department.  You get 10 carded and a lifetime background <br/>
check, but you don't have to do anything special.  Getting a Class A <br/>
LTC (which is what I have) involves a lot more training and <br/>
certifications.<br/>
