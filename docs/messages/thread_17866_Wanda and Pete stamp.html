<br/>
Being relatively new to the sport, I have set myself a few game goals to be excited by.<br/>
1. Find first letterbox (done before I discovered this group, so you all didn't hear about it)<br/>
2. Find a hitchhiker<br/>
3. Carve my first stamp (done but waiting for less snow and more ground before planting)<br/>
4. Go to a gather<br/>
5. Find a letterbox with a Wanda and Pete stamp in it (odds say there had to be one around <br/>
here somewhere)  AND I FOUND IT TODAY!! - thanks to Psychomommy and Turtle's "Going <br/>
Fishing With Grandpa" box!!<br/>
6. Meet another letterboxer on the trail<br/>
7. Receive and pass on a Postal Letterbox<br/>
and <br/>
8. Go letterboxing while on vacation in another state<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So...3 game goals in only 5 months!  Slow for some perhaps but FUN for me<br/>
<br/>
