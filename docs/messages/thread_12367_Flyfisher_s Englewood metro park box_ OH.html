                    <div class="plaintext-content">Flyfisher, I cannot find your box.  I looked for well over an hour <br/>
and could not find it.  I have never needed glasses so I don't think <br/>
that's it.  There does appear to have been a lot of activity in that <br/>
general area though, possibly a maintainence worker discovered it.  <br/>
I was especially let down by this because I grew up less than a mile <br/>
away from that very spot.(I was visiting family today)  Many a dull <br/>
day of my youth were spent in the Englewood Reserve.  Please let me <br/>
know what the condition is.  I am very anxious to have that stamp in <br/>
my journal.  Thanks.<br/>
