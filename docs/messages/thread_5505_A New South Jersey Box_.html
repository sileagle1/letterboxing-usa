Placed on: 5-26-02<br/>
By: Ann and Dan<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in South Jersey lies a circular body of cold, blue water.  The <br/>
water remains unnaturally cold, even on the hottest of summer days.  Some <br/>
say that it was created by a meteorite crashing into the ground.  Others <br/>
speak more ominously of the Devil's bathtub. A bottomless blue hole where <br/>
the Jersey Devil himself waits to drag unwary bathers down into the abyss.  <br/>
Which is correct?  We don't know, but just to be safe side we did not go in <br/>
despite the heat.<br/>
<br/>
Old timers will tell you that the watery blue hole is nearly impossible to <br/>
find.  That the bridge has washed away.  That you need to have a boat to <br/>
reach the spot.  But you know how us young whippersnappers are today.  <br/>
Always looking for the easy way to do things. All I can tell you is that we <br/>
left the kayak at home.  We parked the car in the Shotgun Range parking lot. <br/>
  We made a right onto the dirt road and followed the blue circle signs. We <br/>
made sure that we never strayed into the areas marked "Warning: Fire Range <br/>
Impact Area".  Dead skeet littered the road near the range.  The road veers <br/>
away from the range and there is evidence of a massive uglification project <br/>
underway.  While we haven't seen the plans for the project, it apparently <br/>
involves spreading orange dirt all over the road. The creepy old building <br/>
that used to be on the left hand side of the road must not have met building <br/>
code standards, because that has been removed leaving only a square outline. <br/>
Eventually the road gives way to a much more aesthetically pleasing, <br/>
although harder to walk on, sugar sand.<br/>
<br/>
At the jughandle on the right hand side, we left the main road for a pine <br/>
needle strewn path marked by another blue circle sign.  A short time later <br/>
we came to clearing of sorts. On the left we could see the road that we had <br/>
left so recently.  On the right, a path was marked with blue blazes.  Need <br/>
we say we took the path.  Eventually we came to the body of water in <br/>
question.  The blue hole of water off to the right if the path seemed to <br/>
fill each of us with a sense of unease.  Then we realized that there was no <br/>
birdsong here, only eery quiet.  The smooth surface of the water became <br/>
disturbed and a dark shape was slowly<br/>
rising to the top.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows why we didn't run down the path in the direction from which we <br/>
came?  For whatever reason, we ran down the path at 80 degrees.  The <br/>
opposite direction!  Before long we realized that we couldn't go much <br/>
further.  We would be at the river's edge soon and we could see the washed <br/>
out bridge.  We ran down a narrow path at 170 degrees.  We were running as <br/>
quickly as we could, but if we had been walking we probably would have gone <br/>
about 20 paces.  We turned into a little alcove at 260 degrees. About 11 <br/>
paces into the alcove, there was a three tree on the left.  We hid on the <br/>
far side of the tree.  We were shaking so hard.  We eventually gathered our <br/>
courage up enough to run back the way we had came.  It was only when we <br/>
reached the car that we realized that we had lost something back at the foot <br/>
of the tree.  We don't have the nerve to go back for it.  Do you have the <br/>
nerve?<br/>
