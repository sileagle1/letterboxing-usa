                    <div class="plaintext-content">I speak for the natives of Rhode Island when I thank all those who <br/>
came and shared in riches of Ninigret on such a forbidding day at <br/>
noone.  The more daunting the weather the warmer the atmosphere in <br/>
the Longhouse.  The wealth of food, hospitality and artwork shown by <br/>
all enriched those who came.   <br/>
<br/>
Now, I encourage you to travel to the land of my brothers, the <br/>
western Niantics, as they continue the festivities this Sunday, <br/>
October 20 at Rocky Neck.  My scouts have told me that the Butterfly <br/>
and her tribe have spent several moons planning for your arrival.  <br/>
<br/>
As for me, I am No one, King Tom, last of the Eastern Niantics.  I am <br/>
not one person but rather the spirit of all those who gathered in the <br/>
inclement weather to celebrate the artistry, camaraderie and <br/>
creativity involved in this addicting sport.  I would encourage you <br/>
to consider using my longhouse at Ninigret every Columbus Day weekend <br/>
to continue celebrating the spirit of letterboxing.<br/>

<br/>
That would be October 12, 2003, at 12 noon?<br/>
<br/>
(puts it in the calendar in INK)<br/>
<br/>
And *this* time, I will figure out a way to bring my children as well.<br/>
