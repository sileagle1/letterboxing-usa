My understanding is to count as a new find, both clues/location and stamp must change. If the location remains the same, I would not count it. But that's only my humble opinion. I'm sure other, more knowing than I, will chime in.<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

<br/>
How would you count a series of microboxes all in one park, but only <br/>
the final one contains the logbook?  So let's say there are 5 boxes <br/>
all of which have their own set of clues, and the first four have <br/>
stamps only, while the fifth has the logbook.  One find or five?<br/>

Why can't someone put their personal stamp's impression on the<br/>
