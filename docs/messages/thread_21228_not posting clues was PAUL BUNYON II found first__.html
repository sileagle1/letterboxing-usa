Dear name withheld:<br/>
<br/>
Please don't feel bad.  You are not the only one; I'm guilty too.  <br/>
<br/>
This summer I had two boxes placed. A couple of weeks went by in which<br/>
I still hadn't gotten the clues posted for them ... even though the<br/>
notes were all done and all I had to do was find internet access and<br/>
type them in.  <br/>
<br/>
Then two other boxers both placed boxes right next to where I had<br/>
hidden my as-yet-unposted-clues boxes! To make matters worse, both<br/>
were  mystery boxes! Of course it's not their fault, how could they<br/>
know I had boxes in the area ... I hadn't posted the clues yet.<br/>
<br/>
So, to protect their mystery clues, I had to (1) wait a little bit<br/>
before posting my boxes and (2) re-work the clues I had previously<br/>
outlined before finally posting them.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; And some like me plant and then don't get around to the clue<br/>
writting.  There are a few in Canada (Jasper, Banff, Vancouver)that I <br/>
hope are still there when I do post the clues!!<br/>
