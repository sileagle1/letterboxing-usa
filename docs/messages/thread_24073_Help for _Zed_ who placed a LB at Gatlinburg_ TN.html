Thank you so much for your offer to care for<br/>
my Gatlinburg (Tennessee) box.  I do not live nearby and have had<br/>
to stop letterboxing for the time being because of<br/>
Hurricane Katrina followed by a diagnosis of a type of<br/>
inflammatory arthritis which makes it impossible for<br/>
me to carve stamps or to hike or even walk much.  I<br/>
don't get online often anymore because of arthritic<br/>
fingers.<br/>
<br/>
Could you possibly send me whatever logs and/or loose<br/>
pages are in the box?  I would be thrilled to see<br/>
them.  I think some other people have already removed<br/>
several of the previous log books.  If you are on any<br/>
of the discussion boards, perhaps you could ask if<br/>
anyone has any of the Gatlinburg logs, and also<br/>
explain to all, with my apologies, why I am no longer<br/>
active.<br/>
<br/>
