There are three active (as far as I know) LBs in the NC Arboretum--<br/>
one is mine, I've checked on one of the others, the third I haven't <br/>
had a chance to get yet. The only one near Chimney Rock which was <br/>
lost in the hurricanes was "Dirty Dancing". don't know if it's been <br/>
replaced yet. "Yes" to the fee requirement for the Chimney. One of <br/>
the Biltmore boxes was possibly lost to Frances ("Cornelia"). I have <br/>
three in the UNC Botanical Gardens.<br/>
<br/>
Littlest Vagabond at Flat Rock is probably still active. I'm not <br/>
sure about the ones at Jump Off Rock in Hendersonville. None were <br/>
there when I went to check for a friend several weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
Check out Quiet Place's Blue Ridge series under NC Mystery at LBNA. <br/>
Three are within an hour's drive and she actually tells you pretty <br/>
much where they are.<br/>
<br/>
"Froggy" and "Appalachian Quilt" (I think that's the name) up on the <br/>
AT are still active I think. There are also some of <br/>
MountainScorpia's in Burnsville, NC. However, AvaJay-IveJay and <br/>
GearHeads 1&amp;2 aren't accessible on Sundays.<br/>
<br/>
If I think of any more, I'll let you know. I'll be around until <br/>
Wednesday and would like to meet for a trade if possible.<br/>

We found this letterbox over Labor Day weekend.  However, it wasn't <br/>
where the clues said it would be.  My 6yo son just happened to find <br/>
it in the vicinity because it wasn't covered!  I emailed the placer <br/>
and let her know where we found it (we did cover it up as best we <br/>
could), but she never got back to me.  So, I have no idea if she put <br/>
it in the correct location.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like me to let you know where WE found it and hid it, email <br/>
me offline at amyruth@comcast.net.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is the Four Seasons Puzzler in Hendersonville.  I know <br/>
that 2 of the 4 letterboxes are definitly MIA and we ran out of <br/>
daylight on the 4th.  Again, if you want more details, email me.<br/>

Hi there. We don't live in Asheville, but have been many times. We <br/>
live in Rocky Mount, NC. The only one we found in Asheville that is <br/>
still active is Swannanoa Gap. It is an interesting box. It is hand <br/>
carved and one of the older stamps in the area. Be warned though, the <br/>
climb is rather steep! It was last found Oct 30, 2004, so it is <br/>
probably still there. Swannanoa Gap (it is misspelled on <br/>
letterboxing.org) is at Black Mountain in Buncombe County. Any other <br/>
boxes we found in the area are now missing. I would contact some of <br/>
the placers of the boxes and ask if they think they are active. Have <br/>
a nice trip and be safe. Good luck hunting!<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth<br/>

Hi, Elizabeth.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of inactive boxes listed on LBNA but the ones below <br/>
are in or near Asheville and are still active. Don't know when you <br/>
were last in the area--my boxes are only a few months old so may not <br/>
have gotten the chance to look for them.<br/>
<br/>
Four of mine are in Asheville and as of two weeks ago when I last <br/>
checked they were all in place: "Child of the Night" at the <br/>
Arboretum and the Botanical Gardens series of three. "Laret's Dam <br/>
LB" is also at the Arboretum and is fairly new; probably still <br/>
there. The Biltmore boxes have been found recently by another boxer <br/>
I know, although Cornelia appears to have floated away. Swannanoa <br/>
Gap is active; I think I was the one who found it Oct. 30. Three of <br/>
the Quiet Blue mystery series are near Asheville and active as of <br/>
mid-September when we found them (this it not a spoiler because she <br/>
actually gives the Parkway milepost reference numbers in her clues).<br/>
<br/>
We found the Chimney Rock boxes in late August as well.<br/>
