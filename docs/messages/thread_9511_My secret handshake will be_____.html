people at the Accotink Wildlife Refuge, Fort Belvoir, Virginia and<br/>
couldn't tell if they were seekers or hikers - we don't think they<br/>
were boxers.<br/>
<br/>
We also passed some more folks at the Rock Creek Planetarium and<br/>
Nature Center whom we thought could be, but weren't - we think.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to start sporting a handkerchief/bandana from the green<br/>
color family.<br/>
<br/>
So if you see someone trekking in the wilds with a green swatch<br/>
prominently displayed on arm/neck/pocket/backpack/or elsewhere it's<br/>
me!  I think I may stitch a poison ivy leaf on it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have only made one exchange.  How I figured out that<br/>
the other people were letterboxers was they looked<br/>
like I did about an hour earlier.  They were walking<br/>
up the trail reading the letterboxing clues, saying<br/>
things what does a yellow birch look like and did we<br/>
bring the tree identification book and did remember<br/>
the compass.  I often wonder if other people on the<br/>
trail are letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should try practicing my morris dancing steps<br/>
as I hike the trail,that would look like a Monty<br/>
Python silly walk.  <br/>

Boy, I'd sure like to run into someone doing morris dancing steps <br/>
along the trail.  But Rick, if you just wear the costume, that will be <br/>
enough for me!<br/>
