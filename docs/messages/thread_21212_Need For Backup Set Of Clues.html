With all the problems lately on LBNA and Atlas Quest, it<br/>
has given me a new sense of urgency to make backups of my <br/>
letterbox clues.  I currenly have my clues in just one<br/>
place, my website on Geocities, with links to them on LBNA.<br/>
If these clues ever got deleted, either accidentaly, <br/>
maliciously or because I am no longer around, they would be <br/>
gone forever.  Unlike some people who plan to retire their <br/>
boxes, I would like mine to live forever if possible, so I <br/>
need to find the best way to back them up.<br/>
<br/>
One way would be to print all of them and keep hardcopies,<br/>
but besides killing trees, this method would not work if I <br/>
am no longer around to retype the clues electronically.  So<br/>
I need to make an electronic copy accessible by others with<br/>
no action required of me.<br/>
<br/>
One way I thought of would be to cut and paste my clues into<br/>
LBNA, but continue to have the link to my clues on Geocities<br/>
be the current way to access them.  That way, if my clues on<br/>
Geocities go missing, someone at LBNA could just delete the <br/>
link to them and the pasted clues would show up.  The down<br/>
side to this is that if something happens to LBNA, I would<br/>
lose both the pasted clues and the links.<br/>
<br/>
Another way would be to post a second set of my clues in <br/>
Atlas Quest, not just a link to my Geocities clues, but the <br/>
actual clues.  Since many people are starting to use AQ and<br/>
I was thinking of putting links to my clues in there anyway,<br/>
it might make more sense to make the extra effort to post<br/>
clues (with graphics) in AQ itself.  That way, a set of my<br/>
clues would exist in 2 places.<br/>
<br/>
No matter which way I go it will require double the <br/>
maintenance keeping up 2 sets of clues, but it would<br/>
be worth it for my peace of mind.  I would love to hear<br/>
other ideas on this subject before I decide what to do.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Why don't you just keep local versions of your clues on your personal<br/>
machine?  Seems a lot simpler that way.  Type them with a program<br/>
where you can run a spel chek, save it, then paste it into Geocities.<br/>
 You've got your publically accessible clues for the world to see and<br/>
a backup copy on your computer.  Periodically, you can even burn the<br/>
clues to a CD and store them in a location other than your computer.<br/>
<br/>
But that way, you only have to maintain clues in a single location<br/>
(your computer), which you would cut and paste into Geocities whenever<br/>
a clue there needs updating.  And since your computer and Geocities<br/>
are (presumeably) in VERY different locations, they can each work as a<br/>
backup for each other.<br/>
<br/>
That's basically what I do to back up Atlas Quest.  It runs on a<br/>
remote server far from my personal computer.  And every couple of<br/>
weeks download the backups to my personal computer.  And occasionally<br/>
I'll burn a CD with the latest data and move to it a location away<br/>
from my personal computer to make it triple safe.  If the worst were<br/>
to happen and the live site lost all of its data and Amanda's<br/>
apartment went up in flames (or my personal computer crashes) at<br/>
nearly the same time, I'd still have a backup of all the data that's<br/>
never more than a month old.  The likelyhood of two sources of data<br/>
going up in smoke at the same time is very remote, but even if it were<br/>
to happen, it would likely not set AQ back more than a couple of weeks<br/>
worth of data.<br/>

addition to storing additional backups periodically on <br/>
different webmaster's computers and even onto CD-ROM.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn't hurt to have your primary clues on geocities <br/>
with a backup copy on LbNA that would be invisible unless <br/>
the link redirect is taken off. This has been useful <br/>
before when someone stopped letterboxing and dropped their <br/>
web account.<br/>
<br/>
Other letterboxers have the option to adopt a box to <br/>
maintain it and the clues on LbNA. A webmaster just needs <br/>
to set the adopter as the "maintainer" in the database. <br/>
The owner is still in the database and can maintain the <br/>
clues if they start letterboxing again. I think AQ has a <br/>
similar concept for box adoption.<br/>

i use a strathmore hardbound sketchbook as my log<br/>
book. before i release a stamp, i flip the book over<br/>
and working backwards (towards the find pages) i mark<br/>
my stamps and write in the clues when they are<br/>
finalized. i also try to write in the clues to the<br/>
ones i have found, some of the prose is really nice. <br/>
<br/>
so if i planted it or found it, a can tell you where<br/>
is WAS when i wrote it down. things keep changin<br/>
tho... i think i am down to one active box. <br/>
<br/>
just an idea...<br/>
<br/>
fun boxing!<br/>
