I am glad to give directions to my store-- I just hate to look like I <br/>
am trying to promote my business on the list. I normally carry 3<br/>
sizes of the Marscarve carving blocks. Unfortunately my supplier is <br/>
back ordered on some sizes currently and I only have a few at the <br/>
moment - but more should arrive soon. <br/>
<br/>
Off Rte 9 take exit 3. If coming from the south (I-95) take a left<br/>
off the ramp then a right at the light.<br/>
If coming from the north (Middletown) take a left off the ramp then <br/>
another left at the light.<br/>
<br/>
Pass a pond on your right, then the Essex Library and Town Hall on <br/>
your left. <br/>
Take a right at the stop sign then immediately bear left to the top<br/>
of Main Street.  Continue down Main St. until the Griswold Inn is on <br/>
your right.<br/>
<br/>
I am located in the same building as the coffee shop that fronts <br/>
directly on Main Street on the left - my store is at the rear of the <br/>
building. I will treat any Lb-ers to a great cup of coffee at the <br/>
coffee shop if you stop in. Should you not have already located the <br/>
Turtle Creek letterbox that would make a nice outing -- I believe the <br/>
other Essex box is currently missing, however.<br/>
<br/>
If the Marscarve blocks are your main goal I suggest you call ahead<br/>
to make sure they have arrived --- toll free 877-662-7761<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see - and meet you soon!<br/>
