<div>There are three new letterboxes in the state of 
Hawaii. [There is a new hitch hiker too]. The lonemasswolf and You Inspire My 
Spirit recently returned from a three week adventure in Hawaii. While there, we 
found the Lanikai Bunkers Letterbox [this should be rated as dangerous], and the 
Koko Crater letterbox. We were unable to locate the I'iwi Letterbox. I am 
reasonably certain that it is missing, as the area was littered with soda and 
beer cans.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We also planted three new letterboxes, and a new 
hitch hiker. The Aloha Hitchhiker was found and brought to New 
England.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Letterbox # 1</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Name:</strong>    Silent 
Sentinel of Makapuu Point</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Location:    
</strong>Makapu'u Point, Oahu</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Directions:    </strong>Makapu'u Lighthouse is one 
of Hawaii's most familiar landmarks commanding a spectacular view of the 
Windward side of O'ahu. From Waikiki take Kalakaua Avenue past the 
Honolulu Zoo and Kapiolani Park. Turn right onto Diamond Head Road. Follow the 
signs going East (to your left) to Kalanianaole Highway (Route 72). Go past 
Hanauma Bay and Sandy Beach Park to Hawaii Kai Golf Course. About  mile past 
the golf course on the right is a gate blocking the trail entrance. Parking is 
along the street - no cars allowed on the trail, do not leave valuables in your 
car. This is a moderate 2-mile hike that is paved but is <strong>quite steep in 
spots</strong>. There is <strong>no shade or restroom facilities</strong> along 
this trail. Start before noon due to the heat, bring plenty of water, and wear 
sunscreen. A fantastic view of the entire coastline and the island of 
Molokai in the distance awaits you. The Molokai Channel runs past Makapu'u 
Lighthouse and is an excellent spot to watch Humpback whales as they travel the 
channel between December and April.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Date Planted:</strong>    17 
June 2002 by the Lonemasswolf and YIMS.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Clues:</strong>    Once you 
have reached the top of the highest observation platform look over the edge to 
see the silent sentinel.  Hike back down to the point where an old paved 
road heads off on a bearing of 210 degrees. At the end of this road, is 
a narrow sandy trail. 40 paces up this trail you will note another faint 
trail heading off to the right. 15 paces along this trail brings you to the 
backside of a cactus patch. The letterbox is hidden under a cactus leaf in this 
area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Letterbox # 2</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Name:</strong>    
Lindbergh's Spirit</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Location:</strong>    
South of Hana, Maui</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Directions:    </strong>The Palapala Ho'omau 
Church is located 8 miles south of Hana on the ocean side of the highway. A 
small road just past Mile Marker #41 leads to the church. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div><strong>Date Planted:</strong>    01 
July 2002 by the Lonemasswolf and YIMS.</div>
<div> </div></div>
<div><strong>Clues:</strong>    The famed aviator, Charles Lindbergh, lived his last days on 
the lush Hana coast. Today he lies at rest on the serene grounds of the Palapala 
Ho'omau Church in beautiful Kipahulu. The limestone coral church was built in 
1857. Lindbergh's grave is under the shade of a Java plum tree. 
Charles Lindbergh died on August 26, 1974. After you have 
visited the grave site, return to the front door of the church. Once facing the 
door, turn to your left. Next to a large banyan tree you can just see the 
remains of a lava stone drinking fountain. The letterbox is hidden below several 
lave stones at the base of the wall to the right of the drinking fountain. 
Exercise great care, as this site is a favorite of the 
young.</div>

<div>Letterbox # 3</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Name:</strong>    Hawaiian 
Wolf Mystery</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Location:</strong>    
Somewhere on the big island, Hawaii.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Date Planted:</strong>    04 
July 2002 by the Lonemasswolf and YIMS.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Clues:</strong>    Although 
there are or were no wolves in Hawaii, if there were, this is where they would 
have first come ashore. Locate the brass plaque that designated this site to be 
a National Historic Landmark in 1964. To the left of this commemoration is 
a thorn tree. Bushwhack over to the opposite side of the thorn tree. The wolf 
mystery letterbox will be found beneath its thorny boughs. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>New Hitchhiker:</strong>    
Sweetie Pie has been placed somewhere in Hawaii.</div>
