<br/>
EMS as a chain carries the Kelty Kids Child carriers.<br/>
These are an excellent investment meant at keeping you<br/>
AND your child safe. Many of the packs come with<br/>
sun/bug screens, pockets for kids<br/>
essentials...diapers, etc. and some have small bags<br/>
for holding the parents stuff to (like letterboxing<br/>
supplies)... they come on a rigid metal frame that<br/>
stands up when you take it off... NOT meant to support<br/>
child in it when off of your back!!!<br/>
<br/>
I do not work for EMS, but I know these are a really<br/>
good product as I would just about stand behind<br/>
anything Kelty makes! Well worth your money!<br/>
<br/>
Chip<br/>

&gt; You could have put  a " free kid "in one had you made it to the <br/>
fair. The pig probably wouldn't have fit in the pocket though.  Do <br/>
look at the shutterbug site in letteboxingcentral. Bill and Val put <br/>
up a pair of pictures for all to see of the gang at the fair. <br/>
