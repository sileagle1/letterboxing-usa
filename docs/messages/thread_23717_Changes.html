We had a major meltdown when our hosting service cancelled out subscription because we'd grown too large for a shared hosting service. It took a few days but we're up on a new "virtual private server" where we won't bother anyone else and can upgrade as we need more horsepower. One featurette that went in was the addition of the option to "archive" your letterbox when it's missing so that it's hidden from the normal searches but still shows up in your member services. You can "unarchive" the box at any time, of course. There's a link on the home page "LbNA Basement" that lists archived boxes by state.<br/>
