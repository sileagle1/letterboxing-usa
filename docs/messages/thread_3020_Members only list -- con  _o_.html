HI, I'd hate to see that happen.  The way it is now a newcomer to <br/>
letterboxing can post to the list just for inquiries or someone who has only <br/>
occasional computer access can post.  Members only might deter a lot of <br/>
folks.  .....<br/>

<br/>
Any list that is open to the public and accepts attachments has very little<br/>
compassion for the inexperienced internet user but certainly is receptive to<br/>
new letterboxers. I  doubt that only being able to read the list on the WWW<br/>
and not post would  really "deter a lot of folks".  It is quick, simple and<br/>
quite painless to register at Yahoo! Groups.<br/>
<br/>
Seems that after reading about the sport and all the messages online if they<br/>
can't perform the challenge of registering at Yahoo! Groups they more than<br/>
likely wouldn't survive the mental and physical rigors of letterboxing! Do<br/>
we need more fatalities? :-)<br/>
<br/>
I vote to ban attachments before XP replaces Win 98 and 2000 and wipes out<br/>
all the computer challenged on this list and close the list to members only.<br/>
But then I am just a kind and compassionate person!<br/>
<br/>
I call your two cents and raise you a penny.<br/>

I would like to see the list become members only to post.<br/>
A curious non-member can still read the posts and get an idea of what <br/>
letterboxing is all about. Then, if interested, can join and post <br/>
with the rest of the MEMBERS!<br/>

If you enter this list from the Letterbox North America site, you <br/>
don't need to be a member.<br/>
If you enter from Yahoo! Groups you do.<br/>

(california) hiking list that I wanted to browse, but it is members <br/>

All of the other less-handy, old-fashioned lists I also subscribe to <br/>
are email only and members only, and frankly, they're cumbersome. I <br/>
enjoy the interaction but wish I had more options on how I'm <br/>
bombarded. Although I hate the advertising, the yahoo group format is <br/>
pretty flexible: people can set it up however they want. <br/>
