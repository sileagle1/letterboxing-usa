Should be freezing there right now. Wish I had stopped there on my trip to<br/>
Virginia, but I didn't get a chance. Must be beautiful in the summer.<br/>
I didn't realize that you had been there. How was it?<br/>

I bet. So, the bees weren't that much of a problem....good. I've been to Monticello. I was lucky enough to know someone (from high school) who worked there. I got a special tour of the house. They let me pick things up and look at them as long as I left things as I had found them. Recent Activity<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">NPS used to have an anti-geocaching/letterboxing policy across the <br/>
board. We just had a similar topic in our geocaching forum on proper <br/>
use of varying lands (NPS, DNR, NWS, USDA, etc) and one individual <br/>
posted this excerpt from a contact they had regarding a softening of <br/>
that stance. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, the rule of thumb we try to use (and not everyone does it, <br/>
but should for the integrity of the hobby) is to get permission from <br/>
the manager of the controlling entity before placing anything.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the excerpt (following is cut and pasted from original <br/>
source):<br/>
<br/>
New NPS Geocaching Policy Provides Opportunities for Outdoor <br/>
Adventure <br/>
<br/>
Geocaching, Virtual Caching and Letterboxing are GPS activities that <br/>
offer significant recreational and educational value to visitors, <br/>
including opportunities for a growing number of families to <br/>
experience outdoor adventure in parks. The National Park Service <br/>
recently released a policy review on GPS-based recreational <br/>
activities in park areas addressing public outreach and education <br/>
challenges, as well as monitoring and management policies. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The recreation community can aid the National Park Service in <br/>
promoting appropriate GPS activities. <br/>
