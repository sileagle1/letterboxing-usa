<br/>
<br/>
Old Gray Cemetery was used as a recreational park for many residents of the<br/>
surrounding neighborhoods. At one time, the cemetery was a popular<br/>
destination for social get-together's after church services on Sunday. As<br/>
there were many influential members of the local society buried in Old Gray,<br/>
the cemetery grounds attracted a number of family members and visitors from<br/>
Knoxville's elite. Additionally, many courting couples used the cemetery for<br/>
"sparking" and an old beech tree still remaining in the cemetery serves as a<br/>
symbol of many loves now lost and forgotten. This tree, carved with many<br/>
hearts and initials, is a beautiful reminder of the importance of<br/>
preservation. Many locals also recount the "good ol' days" when the cemetery<br/>
was a favorite spot for sledding and playing tag. Even today, local<br/>
residents can be found using the roads of the cemetery for recreational uses<br/>
such as walking and running.<br/>
<br/>
**************<br/>
<br/>
Mount Auburn Cemetery (the country's first garden cemetery)<br/>
<br/>
Our founders believed that burying and commemorating the dead was best done<br/>
in a tranquil and beautiful natural setting at a short distance from the<br/>
city center. They also believed that the Cemetery should be a place for the<br/>
living, "embellishing" the natural landscape with ornamental plantings,<br/>
monuments, fences, fountains and chapels. This inspired concept was copied<br/>
widely throughout the United States, giving birth to the rural cemetery<br/>
movement and the tradition of garden cemeteries. Their popularity led, in<br/>
turn, to the establishment of America's public parks.<br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
<br/>
The gardens fell into disrepair but have been partially restored and the<br/>
north end of the Cemetery is now a favourite spot for wedding photographers.<br/>
During summer weekends you will see more wedding cars than hearses at Union<br/>
Cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
***************************<br/>
<br/>
I had wanted to find a historical photo of an event (other than a Memorial<br/>
Day event or something like that) happening in a cemetery but I am just too<br/>
tired to continue the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that someone mentioned how in the past cemeteries were multi<br/>
functional.... seen as a gathering place, for happy times, not only sad.<br/>
<br/>
Do I think we should be having parties in cemeteries?  Probably not, but<br/>
given the "right" occasion.....   And do I think it's "ok" to climb on<br/>
interesting statues in cemeteries. Hmmm... maybe.  Who wouldn't want to sit<br/>
atop an elephant statue, no matter where it is?  If that same statue was<br/>
sitting outside the cemetery fence no one would object.<br/>
<br/>
Should we do damage in cemeteries?  Of course not, we shouldn't do that<br/>
anywhere.  Should we only visit our dead relatives, talk in whispers and dab<br/>
at our eyes when we are in a cemetery?  Nope, I don't agree with that.<br/>
<br/>
I have been in college classes that went to cemeteries.   We were a large<br/>
group, tramping through, we had laughs along the way, as well as lessons.<br/>
Why is that ok but a family who is having fun is not ok?<br/>
<br/>
Blah... falling asleep at the keyboard, can't think straight enough to<br/>
futher my points.<br/>

This reminds me of old Homecoming Days the country churches in my area would<br/>
hold, when all the families and former church members would return to honor<br/>
those left behind in the church's cemetery (every little country church has<br/>
one around here) and to do maintenance and clean up on the church and<br/>
cemetery grounds.  Families would spread lunches out among the gravestones<br/>
after Sunday church when the preacher preached like he would never take the<br/>
pulpit again and ate a good meal together, then set about their work while<br/>
the children played - in the cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
Being more of a town girl than a country girl, I was aware of but not well<br/>
versed in the Homecoming Day customs, so I was a bit shocked when after<br/>
one such Homecoming one of my little baseball players showed up for practice<br/>
with his leg in a cast.  To my horror (quaint as the Homecoming custom<br/>
sounds, I have never been able to reconcile myself to it), he told me a<br/>
tombstone had fallen on his leg and broken it.  He told me he had gotten in<br/>
BIG trouble and I asked him if that was because he had been playing in the<br/>
cemetery and he said "No, it was because I knocked Uncle Harry's headstone<br/>
over - again".<br/>
<br/>
I still can't imagine eating a meal in a cemetery, or hanging out there, or<br/>
letting my kids play there, but I have to say I do admire the approach some<br/>
folks are able to take with respect to cemeteries, of treating them as a<br/>
normal outcome of life and living and so nothing to be treated with any more<br/>
or less respect than should be due to any living being.  If we can't treat<br/>
each other with respect and care while we are alive, why should we expect<br/>
respect and care when we are dead?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In my neck of the woods, birthday celebrations at a child's gravesite can be<br/>
very popular.  And often, they're not quiet, somber affairs.<br/>
<br/>
Also in my neck of the woods, the Hispanic Day of the Dead celebrations can<br/>
get pretty durn elaborate in a couple of these cemeteries.<br/>
<br/>
There was also recently a family that arranged to have a horse drawn hearse<br/>
at a local cemetery because the deceased had been heavily into horses.<br/>
Horrors!  The horse pooped in the cemetery.  Nobody thought twice about it<br/>
however, because the culture of the area is "horsey."  Yes, it was cleaned<br/>
up.  Would it cause anyone present that day to think horses should never be<br/>
allowed in cemeteries however?  Nope.  Just clean up &amp; move on.<br/>
<br/>
I've also seen some very odd voodoo like celebrations going on in one of<br/>
Chicago's cemeteries with a family at a gravesite.  Was I interested in<br/>
hanging around for that?  Noooooooo, I just backed right on outta there.<br/>
Very quietly.  Verrrry quietly.  But would I ever say it was wrong or<br/>
inappropriate or whatever.  Nope.  It's not my call to say.<br/>
<br/>
And then there are the gangbangers........<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong.  I don't advocate gangs anymore than I advocate dogs<br/>
peeing on headstones.  But.......they can be a very large presence and a<br/>
very large culture at one or two of the cemeteries in the area, and they<br/>
have their own culture when they come once a year to celebrate the death of<br/>
a fellow high-ranking gang member.   There's a local cemetery that has more<br/>
than their share of gang members buried there because they donate a certain<br/>
number of graves to poverty level families that otherwise wouldn't be able<br/>
actually afford a plot someplace -- so it's a courtesy to the parents, not<br/>
to the gang members, and families come out from Chicago to bury their slain<br/>
teens there.  And then the family slowly saves up for a headstone.  The gang<br/>
members tend to arrive either close to closing or right after so that they<br/>
won't disturb other folks, and then they have quite a party, and not always,<br/>
but generally clean up quite well afterwards. Is it wrong?  I dunno.  The<br/>
cemetery management is OK with it.  It's their call, not mine.<br/>
<br/>
And like I said in another post, my mother's huge Irish family gets together<br/>
once a year at my grandmothers' gravesite.   It's a very large annual family<br/>
picnic.  No grills, but blankets and picnic baskets all spread out and a lot<br/>
of Irish "tunin'" going on.  The cemetery management has no problem with it.<br/>
Might someone else who shows up at the cemetery think it's "rude?"  Sure.<br/>
But they're welcome to join in -- there's always plenty of good food and<br/>
good music for everybody!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
For some people, cemeteries aren't just to mourn for the dead.  They're also<br/>
to celebrate the *life* of that dead, and their life in the hereafter.  Or<br/>
just life in general, particularly when it comes to children.<br/>

More thoughts on cemeteries. I love them. My grandmother dragged me around as a kid to <br/>
do family reseach, so as a kid I spent alot of time amusing my self in them.<br/>
In my home town the locals use it as a place to walk. No traffic and a great walking surface <br/>
on the roads. Show up on a sat. afternoon and a good part of the town is there getting <br/>
exersize.<br/>
