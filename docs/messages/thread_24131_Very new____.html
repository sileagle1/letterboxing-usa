wait on it.  (Yes, I created one and didn't go with a prefabricated <br/>

Oh well, I don't have a stamp yet, so I can't really do anything if I <br/>
was able to find it! ;-)<br/>

Anyway, I'm excited.  I love treasure hunts.  I got introduced to them <br/>

I have a few links below that you might find helpful. <br/>
Regarding the requirement of 10 finds, I think this clue listing is on <br/>
Atlas Quest rather than LbNA as I pretty sure that LbNA has no such <br/>
function available. I suggest that you go to the AQ site and contact <br/>
the placer and ask for a copy of the clue sheet. It seems a little <br/>
silly to me that find requirements are used particularly for a box in <br/>
that location.<br/>

You might be surprised. Welcome to the hobby, have lot's of fun with it.<br/>

<br/>
I've already emailed the clues to her.  They probably got dumped into <br/>
her junk mail file, though, as I haven't yet heard back from her saying <br/>
she'd received them.  Hopefully, she'll check it before she departs on <br/>
Monday.  I placed on F count restriction on it because it's an orphaned <br/>
letterbox and we spent A LOT of travel money to plant it so we're <br/>
hoping that it's well taken care of by future visitors.  Doesn't <br/>
matter, though, the other one we planted in Thailand has already been <br/>
washed down the mountain in massive flooding that occurred about 4 <br/>
months after we planted it.  Only noticed that when CNN aired a segment <br/>
on the devastation in the area where we hid it resulting from the <br/>
massive rains.  Just one of the many hazards of remote letterbox <br/>
planting I presume...  Unfortunately, these stamps were some of my <br/>
better stamps out there.  Somehow only the awful stamps seem to survive <br/>
for years...  What I'd do to be able to head back there these days!!!  <br/>
Of course if anybody would like to sponsor some letterbox maintenance <br/>
trips for us we'd return there in a heartbeat to repair our <br/>
boxes...  ;)  Just drop us a note...will work for travel $$$!!!<br/>

You were right, the email was in my junk mail file. <br/>

especially if you used lock n'lock. Wouldn't it be cool to have a<br/>
letterbox float away and show up somewhere else to have someone find<br/>
it. You know like message in a bottle??<br/>
hmmm. <br/>
Tee hee, imagine, one day when you are 95, you might be 'setten at yur<br/>
table at the nursin home and someone might pull up der chair and say,<br/>
"you know , when I was a young lass on holidays I found here, this<br/>
strange container afloatin' ..." and they pull out your letterbox??<br/>
Now that would be fun!!!-- <br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree with Don. I would contact the placer and at least ask them. <br/>
&gt; You might be surprised. Welcome to the hobby, have lot's of fun with it.<br/>

&gt; I've already emailed the clues to her.  They probably got dumped into <br/>
&gt; her junk mail file, though, as I haven't yet heard back from her saying <br/>
&gt; she'd received them.  Hopefully, she'll check it before she departs on <br/>
&gt; Monday.  I placed on F count restriction on it because it's an orphaned <br/>
&gt; letterbox and we spent A LOT of travel money to plant it so we're <br/>
&gt; hoping that it's well taken care of by future visitors.  Doesn't <br/>
&gt; matter, though, the other one we planted in Thailand has already been <br/>
&gt; washed down the mountain in massive flooding that occurred about 4 <br/>
&gt; months after we planted it.  Only noticed that when CNN aired a segment <br/>
&gt; on the devastation in the area where we hid it resulting from the <br/>
&gt; massive rains.  Just one of the many hazards of remote letterbox <br/>
&gt; planting I presume...  Unfortunately, these stamps were some of my <br/>
