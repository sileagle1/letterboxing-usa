I think there needs to be a place where Letterboxers can feel free to talk about, promote, <br/>
advertise and review commercial products that might be of use/interest to other <br/>
letterboxers without criticism.  <br/>
<br/>

Dearest Huntr et al,<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful lovely suggestion. Of course her Ladyship must admit<br/>
to an ironic chuckle. What, she wondered would be the reaction to<br/>
someone promoting his or her list/web site? Is this actually different<br/>
from promoting a product, after all a web site/list serve is a<br/>
product? What sorts of flames will this fan? What fun we'll have.<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship also thought to herself, "Oh great, yet another list to<br/>
follow." With all the obligations that weigh upon the noble brow there<br/>
simply isn't time to keep up. Would that one place such as this one<br/>
could cover all needs but then with the massive growth of this hobby<br/>
such compartmentalization is probably unavoidable.<br/>
<br/>
Anticipatorially,<br/>
