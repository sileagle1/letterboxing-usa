<br/>
<br/>
Recently there has been a conversation going on the list that I am <br/>
sure you are all aware of. That being what people should talk about <br/>
on this list, the treatment of new letterboxers, elitism and so on. <br/>
<br/>
There have been some people that have expressed that they are <br/>
elitists to the letterboxing hobby. I praise you for that, but in my <br/>
opinion if you are going to glorify yourself in such a regard and <br/>
ambiguously be the paradigm then you are not taking on that full <br/>
responsibility. If you have a vast amount of knowledge when it comes <br/>
to letterboxing, then you have a choice to make here on the list. <br/>
What is that choice? YOU can ether be a part of the solution or part <br/>
of the problem. <br/>
<br/>
There has been talk about fellow letterboxers going out and <br/>
destroying boxes inadvertently or otherwise, boxes that have not <br/>
been re-hidden and so on. There have been new people asking <br/>
questions, wanting to learn, desiring to glean what knowledge you <br/>
have gained along your elite path. And yet what has been occurring? <br/>
Very little that is positive that is for sure. Some instead of <br/>
teaching, instead of guiding, instead of making an effort to explain <br/>
in a well thought out positive manner what to do and not to do or <br/>
where to find this information, we see the things that have been <br/>
said recently. Therefore you are being a part of the problem, if you <br/>
don't want to put forth the effort to help, discuss, and share, then <br/>
the post that you are getting so up in arms about has a big "X" on <br/>
it, use it. <br/>
<br/>
On the front page of this list it reads; "This is a discussion group <br/>
for letterboxing enthusiasts in the New World. The list is intended <br/>
for sharing of ideas, stories, tips, news, advice, and clues related <br/>
to the hobby of letterboxing." <br/>
<br/>
In order to achieve this lists intended goal it is obvious that <br/>
there has to be questions, there has to be encouraging answers, and <br/>
above all there has to be the sharing of each individual's <br/>
experience. The only way that a person gains knowledge is from <br/>
experience and one of those ways is by applying what they have <br/>
learned on this list. Anyone and I mean anyone has the right to ask <br/>
any question that they want in regards to letterboxing.  Those that <br/>
want to help or discuss in a positive manner are welcomed and <br/>
encouraged to do so, even if that is to explain to someone that they <br/>
can find that question discussed in the past on this very list, or <br/>
direct them to search it on the vast internet, or give them the link <br/>
to a useful site. <br/>
<br/>
To everyone on that is a member of this list, whether you are new <br/>
here or have been around a long time. Talk about letterboxing if <br/>
that is your wish, ask questions that you can not find the answers <br/>
to. Share your ideas, stories, tips, news, advice, and clues. Those <br/>
that want to be a part of the solution with take part as they <br/>
should. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well. <br/>
