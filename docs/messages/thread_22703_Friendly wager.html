The orginional deal was we'd send a box to Wink so he could bask in<br/>
his victory (or he to us). Maybe he was afraid the White Sox would go<br/>
all the way and he'd have to sepnd the fall hiding boxes all over NY.<br/>

Oh, I SO remember that feeling. My first words as it approached<br/>
midnight last October 27th when the last out was made in the 2004<br/>
World Series were, "What am I going to do with the rest of my life?"<br/>
since I had spent 50 years wishing and hoping for a Red Sox<br/>
championship. No worries, the Sox started to make me mad (in an<br/>
I-love-them-sort-of-way) all over again this year. Only, this time we<br/>
can't blame the Bambino.<br/>
There's always next year...<br/>
