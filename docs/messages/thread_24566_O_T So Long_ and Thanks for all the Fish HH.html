&gt; We ventured BACK to Norwich tonight to re-try the Compass Rose...as <br/>
&gt; luck would have it... we found it! Yay! After the first attempt, we <br/>
&gt; got frustrated and went to smell the roses. Stopped back with <br/>
&gt; a "fresh outlook" and bingo! Also found the recently released and <br/>
&gt; well-travelled "So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish" hitchhiker. We <br/>
&gt; hope to bring it some joy and happiness on wednesday as it continues <br/>
&gt; a wonderful journey. <br/>
