Series!  I was successful in finding all eight stamps and even met Lego Woodman <br/>
and Woman Who Writes on Horses on the hunt!  It's a great series so go out <br/>
and get it before it disappears Oct 31st!<br/>
<br/>
I also went and found Church Grim and I Love Ice Cream on my way to Sunshine <br/>
and Swamp Yankee's house.  I also found a mystery box along the way too!<br/>
<br/>
However, I did not find Life on the Natchaug in North Windham, so if anyone <br/>
has found it, please let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
