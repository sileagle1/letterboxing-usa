<br/>
Call it whatever you like, but many do consider letterboxing to be a <br/>
game.  I do not agree that "game" implies a winner and a loser.  My <br/>
dictionary defines game as "an activity engaged in for diversion or <br/>
amusement, often involving strategy or a competition."  I think that <br/>
fits perfectly -- competition does not have to be with another <br/>
person, it can be with the elements, the clues, even with yourself. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to help other folks have a good time, <br/>
&gt; stay here in Letterboxing.  <br/>
&gt; Sadly, not all posters here seem to want others to have a good <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; and be successful.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not sure where you got the impression that letterboxing is <br/>
about helping other people.  Of course the goal is for everyone to <br/>
have a good time, but the crux of this game is not to help others.  <br/>
It is about adventure and challenge -- both in creating a letterbox <br/>
and finding a letterbox.  The goal when planting a letterbox is to <br/>
create a fun and challenging "hunt," not necessarily to ensure the <br/>
success of your finders.  There are many ways to provide for the <br/>
enjoyment of seekers -- a great hike through old-growth forest, a <br/>
scenic lakeside destination, a puzzling set of clues, a skillfully <br/>
carved stamp, etc.  It is not just about leading them to the box.  <br/>
If that were the case, we'd all be planting drive-by boxes with 1-2-<br/>
3 clues to ensure that each and every seeker is successful in <br/>
logging the find.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For example #1: a desire to conceal the fact that <br/>
&gt; no one can find their box.  For example: a desire to conceal their <br/>
&gt; clues, so that fewer people can enjoy them.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think anyone is trying to do this.  Many people do not list <br/>
their clues on any of the major clue sites, but they are readily <br/>
available on personal internet sites to anyone who bothers to look <br/>
for them.  Granted, they are not being handed directly to you, but <br/>
they are available.  Even in situations where box clues are not <br/>
posted anywhere (i.e. WOM boxes), the idea behind that is still to <br/>
provide enjoyment for the seekers.  I have never met a letterboxer <br/>
who has been given a WOM clue who wasn't tickled to death to have <br/>
been entrusted with it.  As for fewer people having the opportunity <br/>
to enjoy those -- yeh, but that is the nature of the game -- not all <br/>
boxes are for all people.  Some you have to earn -- that is part of <br/>
the fun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing should be fun - like a huge party where everyone can <br/>
&gt; have a great time.<br/>
<br/>
On this we agree.  We each garner our own sense of fun based on our <br/>
personal interests and our individual philosophy of the game.  I get <br/>
much enjoyment from the way I play the game -- both as a planter and <br/>
a seeker.  You can play how you want to play and hopefully that is <br/>
fun for you.  I don't really care how you are choosing to play -- <br/>
just don't come around trying to impose your style on me or trying <br/>
to dumb-down the game for those of us who still enjoy the <br/>
challenging and clandestine aspects of the way it is played.<br/>
<br/>
After all, I am not preaching to you or anyone else that each person <br/>
who plants a letterbox must hand-carve the stamp, hand-bind the log <br/>
book and create witty and clever mystery clues requiring at least a <br/>
2-3 mile hike to a scenic destination (which is is my personal <br/>
preference for a letterbox). <br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">1.  The word "game" might *imply* competition against others to you, but<br/>
that's a long way from the total definition of the word.  When children play<br/>
"games" there's often no competition at all.  One definition is merely as a<br/>
"pastime or amusement."<br/>
<br/>
And what about the "game" of diplomacy?  OK OK, I suppose some could opine<br/>
that there's plenty of competition there.  So OK, forget that one.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, with letterboxing, I *am* competing.  With myself.  Sort of like<br/>
working crossword puzzles.  To see how I've improved in my clue reading<br/>
abilities, in my compass working abilities, etc.  Some folks compete at<br/>
crossword puzzles by timing themselves against others.  Other people compete<br/>
against themselves, aiming to get better and better.  I don't play Solitaire<br/>
much myself but that's another "game" where a person is basically playing<br/>
for amusement and, if competing, they're competing against themself.  I love<br/>
to do maze puzzles.  That's another game where I'm competing with nobody but<br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
Some placers put First Finder Certificates and/or prizes in new boxes they<br/>
place.  And some searchers compete to be that first finder.  So sometimes<br/>
there *is* a little competition.  Some placers don't like the aspect of that<br/>
"race" and no longer do First Finder Certificates.  To each his/her own.<br/>
Whatever floatsdaboat.<br/>
<br/>
2.  "If you want to help folks........"  I'd have to simply disagree with<br/>
you here.  I don't see letterboxing as charity.  If I want to help folks,<br/>
I'll maybe donate to the local food pantry.  Or help teach English to<br/>
someone who just got here from Guatemala and needs some drastic help with<br/>
their English skills. Etc.  Pippi &amp; Keith had a letterbox, now retired, at a<br/>
local cemetery that was on the grounds of a large shopping mall.  The clues<br/>
were easy for some folks, difficult for others -- it kind of depended on how<br/>
people worked their imaginations and then did a little research.  The people<br/>
who couldn't figure it out received no charity.  Were they owed any?  Nah.<br/>
<br/>
3.  You state that "concealing clues" is OK as long as there's a good<br/>
motive?  Oh dear, you're opening the list up to "squabbles" again.  :-)  Who<br/>
gets to decide the "goodness" of a person's motive?  Is there a Bishops<br/>
Council of Letterboxing to rule on the Goodness of Motive?<br/>
<br/>
4.  There are going to be boxes with comfusing clues.  A lot of boxers find,<br/>
when they go back and re-examine those clues a couple of years later, and<br/>
many found boxes down the road, that those clues weren't really all that<br/>
confusing.  The boxer was just new to the game.  Some people need to get<br/>
their feet wet with a lot of simpler boxes.  Other people are Einsteins from<br/>
the get-go.  I was no Einstein.  When I started out, I was basically one of<br/>
those Romper Room Rejects.  Still often am because I've only been playing a<br/>
couple of years now.<br/>
<br/>
But then I'm also a person who doesn't mind doing "confusing" in the least.<br/>
Confusing can be fun.  Can make me think outside the box, no pun intended.<br/>
"Confusing" is what a lot of "mystery" boxes are all about.  I *do* like<br/>
clues to be accurate, but even when they're not, that can be OK too.<br/>
Sometimes it's fun to try to get into the mind of a new placer and try to<br/>
figure out "OK, could they have meant *this* instead of *that*?" and try<br/>
working the clues by changing things a bit.   One of my favorite boxes took<br/>
us three hours to find because the placer wrote "east" and should have<br/>
written "north."  We decided to try it with all four directions.<br/>
Unfortunately, ended up trying north last, so it took us three hours. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But sure, I'd prefer the clues to be accurate.  Whenever I've gone searching<br/>
for the box of someone who's just beginning to place boxes, I always have a<br/>
bit of trepidation because I know nothing of their style, nothing of how<br/>
accurate they are, etc.  Sometimes that can be part of the fun, sometimes<br/>
it's part of the frustration.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Yep, I most certainly agree that letterboxing is *about* having fun.<br/>
But in a huge variety of ways.  Sometimes the way I start out expecting to<br/>
have fun that day isn't the way I end up having fun.  But it can *all* be<br/>
fun if I stay flexible.  And some days my attitude is more flexible than<br/>
others.  Sometimes I'll open a box to find a store-bought stamp and be<br/>
really disappointed.  Super disappointed.  Ready to strangle the placer.  Is<br/>
the placer obligated to put a "unique" stamp in their box so that I'll have<br/>
fun?  No.  Am I obligated to appreciate finding a store-bought stamp?  No.<br/>
OK, so that trip might not end up being all that much fun that day.  For me.<br/>
Better luck another day.<br/>
<br/>
I do disagree tho that letterboxing is a game where *every*body is going to<br/>
have fun.  For some people, letterboxing just isn't going to end up being<br/>
*their* thing.  For others, they'll enjoy some hunts and not others.  I<br/>
don't see that there's an obligation to make the game everybody's cup of tea<br/>
or every search everybody's cup of tea.  Is that obligation built into other<br/>
games?  Why does it have to be built into letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
I guess the way I figure it, I'm responsible for making my own fun.  When I<br/>
go to a large party, I don't hold the host responsible for whether or not<br/>
*I* had fun.  I don't do it in letterboxing either.  Fun or not fun -- it's<br/>
my choice.<br/>
