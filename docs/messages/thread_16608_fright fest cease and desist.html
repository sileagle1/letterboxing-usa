This may be old news for all I know ...<br/>
<br/>
I received a "cease and desist" letter from a New York law firm asserting<br/>
that use of the name "fright fest" (as in the name of a recent gathering <br/>
in WA) impinged on their client's property rights, specifically trademark <br/>
#1,794,449.  It asserted a belief in damage to their client's brand, <br/>
"confusion", "unfair competition", "deceptive acts", and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't come up with this name -- this is simply an FYI for whomever did,<br/>
who may or may not be on this list -- thought I'd pass it along.  They <br/>
insist letterboxing.org cease and desist promoting events with this name <br/>
or face "appropriate legal actions", I guess 'cause its listed in the <br/>
"What's Hot" section.  Dunno if anyone else has received such a letter <br/>
asking for different (or similar) relief.  Just an FYI to the organizer(s)<br/>
of this event.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
