Subject: [LbNA-WM] Maydale and Paint Branch Boxes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My letterboxing partner and I just visited both "We Are The World" and<br/>
"Paint<br/>
&gt; Branch" and have information to report on both.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We were unable to find the "We Are The World" box, although the site is<br/>
&gt; beatiful and I'd like to encourage boxers to visit regardless.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The "Paint Branch" box was also unfindable.  We also were unable to find<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; than one of the landmarks.  It is on private property which threatens<br/>
&gt; prosecution.  I know that this box was placed a mere two months ago, but<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; was a scary experience.  Perhaps the box is there and we just didn't<br/>
search<br/>
&gt; enough, but I don't want to pay a hefty fine for finding a letter box.  I<br/>
&gt; recommend posting this fact to the site.  It's not for the faint of heart.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
