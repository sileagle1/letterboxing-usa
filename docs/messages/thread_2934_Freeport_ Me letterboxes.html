I also hunted for the "Postcard from Maine" letterbox in South <br/>
Portland and could not find it.  It was supposed to be under the <br/>
foundation of a fishing shack, and I crawled under there for a better <br/>

other trash under there which makes me think it was taken away or <br/>
vandalized.<br/>

I want looking for "postcard from Maine" in early july, and I found <br/>
it to be missing as well-  Will the Drew clan be back to put another <br/>
in the area?<br/>
