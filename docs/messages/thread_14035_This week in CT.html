John Wayne Series - Very enjoyable. Love the trivia. I now need to rent JW movies as I have only seen 50% of the movies                                         mentioned on the trail. I love the bridge on this trail!<br/>
Elephant series (South) Found 5 of the 6 but that was my fault. I missed a paragraph and when I realized it we were too far away for                                 the little feet in our group to back track. I am still catching grief on this one from Freedom Fox! Anyway the                                 Horton Box &amp; Jumbo are my favorites! <br/>
RTRW the kids &amp; I went to Beaver Pond, Windham Trust Duck Blind (the kids LOVED this one), New York SQ, JJZR, Gone                                         Fishing, Troop 25, and Putnam Airline Bridge. Then we ate at a restaurant not far from this trail called Nikki's                                 that is train themed. Tied right in!<br/>
Yesterday we (F.Fox, Odillio, Licks &amp; myself) found Pink Panther, Totem Pole, Merrow Park, 3 Wizards, Circle of Life, &amp; Friendly                                         Skies. ( All but 1 in good shape as Odillio mentioned in an earlier post) <br/>
Today we found our final piece of the gazebo (we have had all but 1 piece since January), Ghoste Riders in the Sky, Rhode Island                                 SQ, Bats in My Belfry, Litter LB (We had an X here with Von der Insel) St Louis, Bridge Over Troubled Water,                                 and Life in the Fast Lane. We watched some go-cart racing from here! Fun spots, fun week!!! Thanks to all                                     the planters!  <br/>
