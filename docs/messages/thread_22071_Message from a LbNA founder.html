<br/>
Yes!  When my mom visits, she wants to visit some of the places that <br/>
letterboxes are planted and get the stamp for herself.  It's fun to<br/>
see <br/>
the stamp again and read through the logbook.  I also have a friend<br/>
who <br/>
can't always box when I can.  When we do get together, we sometimes<br/>
go <br/>
to boxes that one or the other of us has missed out on.  What fun!<br/>

<br/>
Me too!  If I find a box that is absolutely delightful, I tend to<br/>
invite a few friends--people who've expressed interest in letterboxing<br/>
but haven't actually tried it yet--to join me "re-finding" the box, so<br/>
that they can see what a great hobby this is.<br/>
<br/>
For me, letterboxing can be like going on attractions at Disney or<br/>
Universal.  After finding the box and returning home, I often think,<br/>
"Oooh, I want to do that again!"  But of course, it's silly to revisit<br/>
the letterbox on your own... so I drag along friends as an excuse to<br/>
go back, and I know that several of them took up letterboxing as a<br/>
result.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking!<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
Aisling<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I have!  We recently took new friends to our first<br/>
box.  We were out on a scouting excursion and they had<br/>
expressed an interest in boxing on a previous<br/>
excursion.  We hiked to the box, taking the long way<br/>
around.  As we approached the box, they decided to<br/>
take a break and rest for a bit.  Lo and behold, they<br/>
chose to sit on the very log where the box was hidden<br/>
and in fact, perched their rears right over it! <br/>
Imagine their surprise when I started rooting around<br/>
for the box right underneath them!  They jumped up<br/>
startled, and we all had a good laugh.  I remember<br/>
that feeling of being taken by surprise to find a box<br/>
so well hidden that you are shocked to find it's<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I've now also taken them to some of my own boxes as<br/>
well as to find boxes I've never found either.  I must<br/>
say, I got a lot of pleasure out of not telling them a<br/>
box was mine, then reading the clues and watching them<br/>
follow them.  Interesting to watch someone interpret<br/>
your own clues.<br/>

Have I? Shoot, I carved my daughter her own sig stamp for her birthday<br/>
so I'd have an excuse to revisit boxes... particularly my own. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I've accompanied two 'boxing parties on the series I created (link<br/>
below), and one of those expeditions led to the 4th box in the series<br/>
being their 100th Find! What a trip!<br/>
<br/>
The other was a great time biking the paths with a former colleague<br/>
(but still a friend).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And, when I get a chance, I checkup on another box in the area whose<br/>
owner is out-of-state.<br/>

Hi Susan,<br/>
 I just returned from a three day letterboxing raft trip and was <br/>
mother henning Cadenza, ABear, and JBear down the East Fork of the <br/>
Carson river near Markleeville, Ca. in their little inflatable kayaks. <br/>
All in pursuit of our solitary letterbox at midway point on the river<br/>
(One visitor since 2002). Needless to say there are many more boxes to <br/>
find in this part of the country now. Both Cadenza and ABear were <br/>
carving their brains out at camp creating some beautiful stamps, and <br/>
JBear was searching for fish. Now those that missed the trip, and you <br/>
know who you are, can either find the new letterboxes via raft or <br/>
kayak, or hike in 6+ miles. Will there be another one? Who knows? <br/>
Rafting for letterboxes is a wet thankless job, but someone has to do <br/>
it.<br/>
