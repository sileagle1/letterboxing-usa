03 of cancer.  Shorty was not short, nor was he a small man in any <br/>
way. He was loved and respected by all that knew him. He was only 48 <br/>
years old.  Make life (yours and others)the best it can be while you <br/>
can.  Hope you meet up with 'Shorty' and take him to nice fun places.<br/>
Happy Trails with many boxes<br/>
