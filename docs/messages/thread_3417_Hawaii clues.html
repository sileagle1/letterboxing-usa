lucky enough to see some of the magic of the Big Island.  The <br/>
petroglyphs truly take you back in time.  <br/>

I would just like to remind any letterboxers who seek this one to be <br/>
very respectful of the petroglyphs and any rock piles you find.  Be <br/>
sure you have the correct "rock pile" before you look for the <br/>
box...rock piles and rocks wrapped in ti leaves are often offerings <br/>
to Hawaiian gods.<br/>

Aloha,<br/>

&gt; Thank you for posting these clues to the<br/>
&gt; "Puako Petroglyph" letterbox. (can I send along a photo as well?)<br/>
&gt; ___________________________________________________________<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the Big Island of Hawaii you will find this magical place of <br/>
sacredness.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Locate the  Holoholokai Beach Park, open each day from 6:30am - <br/>
6:30pm. The<br/>
&gt; road to this park connects to the road at the Orchid at Mauna Lani. <br/>
This<br/>
&gt; coast is steeped with history and it is here that you will find the <br/>
Puako<br/>
&gt; Petroglyph trail. It is .7 miles of mystical trails within the <br/>
archway  of<br/>
&gt; Kiawi trees. You must pay attention at all times as the trail hosts <br/>
both<br/>
&gt; sand and lava. At the end of the trail is one of the largest <br/>
collections of<br/>
&gt; Hawaiian Petroglyshs ever exposed. Find the bench at the field and <br/>
walk 21<br/>
&gt; steps straight back into the forest. This will lead you up a little <br/>
hill to<br/>
&gt; an out-cropping of boulders. Buried in a small collection of rocks <br/>
at the<br/>
&gt; inside base of the boulders is the letterbox. Enjoy the spirit of <br/>
place and<br/>
&gt; plan for a picnic at the glorious beach park!<br/>

&gt; Petroglyphs<br/>
&gt; Ancient Hawaiian Rock Art<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Want to get a true picture of the history of Hawai'i? You can learn <br/>
a lot<br/>
&gt; from Hawaiian petroglyphs - ancient rock carvings that tell stories <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; early life on the islands.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Hawaiian petroglyphs is a great mystery of the Pacific. No one <br/>
knows who<br/>
&gt; made them or why the artists etched the linear and triangular <br/>
figures into<br/>
&gt; the pahoehoe lava. These<br/>
&gt; graphic carvings, more than 3,000 of them, were probably made as <br/>
part of<br/>
&gt; ritual or prayer and speak of spiritual phenomena - mana<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The petroglyphs of Hawai'i are much more than captivating designs. <br/>
To the<br/>
&gt; ancient Polynesians they had meaning and significance, including a <br/>
spiritual<br/>
&gt; component. Hawaiian petroglyphs deserve to be protected and <br/>
preserved as<br/>
&gt; nonrenewable assets and as gift left behind by the ancient <br/>
Hawaiians who<br/>
&gt; carved their prayers and offerings into the hard lava of these <br/>
Pacific<br/>
&gt; islands.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Upon approaching a petroglyphs field, a wonderful cast of <br/>
characters leap to<br/>
&gt; life. There are dancers, paddlers, fishermen, and family groups. <br/>
Turtle,<br/>
&gt; dog, ship and horse symbols are also depicted, as well as fish <br/>
hooks,<br/>
&gt; spears, poi pounders and canoes. There are 135 different <br/>
petroglyphs sites<br/>
&gt; on six inhabited islands, but most of them are found on the Big <br/>
Island of<br/>
&gt; Hawai'i.<br/>
