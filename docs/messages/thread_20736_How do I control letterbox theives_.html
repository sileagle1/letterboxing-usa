I have been letterboxing just over a year (F165), and have just <br/>
started to place some.  The first few I placed, were out of my area; <br/>
and have had good success.  Recently I have placed some really nice <br/>
stamps locally, just to have them go missing.  I suspect a Bandit, <br/>
who actually had the gall to ask for help on one of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
What do others do to discourge theft of your boxes?  I have thought <br/>
about NOT posting the clues; but rather make them request the clues <br/>
from me directly.  Of course people could lie and have multiple e-<br/>
mail addresses.  How much personal information would a legit <br/>
letterboxer be willing to give out to get the clues?<br/>

Hi Lee &amp; Nancy,<br/>
Sorry to hear that your boxes have gone missing. Gwen &amp; I haven't <br/>
had a chance to go look for them yet. Are these just around Apple <br/>
Valley or in Barstow too? The Taco Bell one seemed like it could be <br/>
located by someone cleaning up the place? The missing boxes could be <br/>
due to careless finders not putting the boxes back properly or not <br/>
being stealthy. You might want to put out a local box that is hidden <br/>
really well and one you can check on regularly and try to determine <br/>
if it is being left out or if it disappears quickly. You might want <br/>
to keep the specific clues off the site for a while and go WOM. To <br/>
set up some form of ID you could ask the finder what letterboxes <br/>
they have found and which ones they have placed. This might give you <br/>
an idea if they are legit or not. We have lost several since the <br/>
Time article,and I think that eventually the losses will slow.<br/>

Something about a hanging body hanging over a<br/>
letterbox is just not right. But it would discourage<br/>
thieves.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this was meant as a joke.<br/>
no flames please.<br/>

All kidding a side there is nothing you can do to stop<br/>
thieves.<br/>
