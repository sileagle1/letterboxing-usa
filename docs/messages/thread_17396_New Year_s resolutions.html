dragged down by the rantings and ravings of this list, so I'll be going 'no<br/>
mail' &amp; checking in on the web on occation.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone needs to contact me regarding postal boxes, my placed boxes, or if<br/>
you have reached the goals of F-100, F-500 or P-100 &amp; want the letterbox<br/>
that commemorates that acheivement to arrive in your mailbox, please contact<br/>
me off list.<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all a healthy, happy and prosperous new year, and look forward to<br/>
meeting you on the trail.<br/>

"If you were arrested for kindness, would there be enough evidence to<br/>
convict you?"<br/>
"If people talk negatively about you, live so that no one will believe them"<br/>
"When you're angry, take a deep breath. When you're really angry, swear"<br/>
"Stupidity is not a crime, you're free to go"<br/>
