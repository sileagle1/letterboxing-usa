Letterbox 3 in Garland,TX  USA<br/>
<br/>

32 degrees 57'10N<br/>

 *   short, pleasant walk from parking lot to letterbox<br/>
 *   I didn't see any poison ivy when I placed the box, but avoid touching<br/>
or brushing against any three-leafed plants just in case!<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:<br/>
Take LBJ Freeway (635) to Garland.<br/>
Exit at Oates Road, go east.<br/>
When you get to a stop light at O'Bannion where you see a sign that reads<br/>
Audubon Park and Wave Pool, turn right.  Follow the road past the Audubon<br/>
Park Rec center and Surf and Swim Wave Pool.  It will twist behind those<br/>
buildings to your left.  Follow it past parking areas first near playground<br/>
equipment, next past picnic tables.  Then it will curve back to the right.<br/>
Follow it to a small parking area on your RIGHT (pass the one on your left)<br/>
that faces some picnic structures.  Park.  After you get out of your car,<br/>
turn your back on the structures.  You are facing the paved trail you want<br/>
to be on.  Walk across the grass to it and turn to your left.  Soon you<br/>
will go under the overpass that carries car traffic.  When you come out on<br/>
the other side, the paved trail forks.  Take the fork that goes off to your<br/>
right.  It curves around to a bench and shortly after that you'll see a<br/>
meadow.  Counting about 40 paces from the bench, look to your right.<br/>
You'll see two man-made structures (I have no idea what these are, but they<br/>
are near each other--one is a big round cement thing, I just found out that<br/>
the other structure is for people who play frisbee golf--in fact you may<br/>
see more of these in this park).  Also present is a telephone pole.  Take<br/>
about 50 paces off the paved trail to your right.  Go to the telephone pole.<br/>
	While at the pole, face the chain thing (frisbee golf goal), do a<br/>
1/8 turn to your left and take about 20 paces toward the brush.  You will<br/>
be stopped by a pile of logs that hide what you seek.<br/>

to your right. Very near the paved trail, you'll see three skinny trees,<br/>
three stumps, and a couple of broken trees that sort of form a<br/>
ring...within the ring leaves hide what you seek.<br/>

I revised the clues page for the Garland letterboxes and I renamed them<br/>
"Duck Creek Letterboxes" since that's the name you have been using.<br/>
I also updated Tom's page to make his map clickable to find the several boxes he<br/>
has in one region. <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering what the proximity is of all the Garland boxes.  As it is I have<br/>
the same map for all 4 (and I think I have the same GPS coords.)  I wonder if we<br/>
shouldn't use a scheme like Tom Cooch's (see the Randolph, VT boxes).  This is<br/>
also similar to the Kenai Peninsula arrangement in Alaska though on a much<br/>
smaller scale.  If your boxes aren't very far apart, or even if they are far<br/>
apart (as in Alaska) it might makle sense to represent the area with a region<br/>
map that indicates the spread of several boxes.  That way you could see the<br/>
relative arrangement.  Just a thought.  Of course the way we have it is just<br/>
fine too.<br/>
