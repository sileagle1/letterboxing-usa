thank you so much for a great gathering.  I had such a wonderful <br/>
time. The weather was perfect.  It was nice to put faces to all the <br/>
names.  I can't wait for the next one.<br/>

I had a wonderful time at the gathering.  I met some new letterboxers <br/>
as well as some good friends in boxing.  Special Thanks to Aili and <br/>
Bruce for putting it all together.  Oh yeah ... and Jay Drew for all <br/>
the replaced boxes which I will have to go do today in the rain!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I love seeing everyone.  It makes reading a log book much more <br/>
enjoyable.  Everytime I read your notes I will imagine you writting <br/>
it.  Even more fun is to hear the stories of peoples adventures (or <br/>
misadventures).  I only started letterboxing on January 19th ... so I <br/>
am a "newbie" but I love to see the different ways everyone gets into <br/>
this activity ... and the different kinds of people that enjoy <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to see everyone.  Hope to see more people on the trail <br/>
this summer!<br/>

4 ... I am checking the dates with the site ... more information to <br/>
come!<br/>
