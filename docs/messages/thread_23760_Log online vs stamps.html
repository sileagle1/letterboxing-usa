 My LBNA recorded finds was equal to my actual finds until I began to move outward from my area. Then I found the records started to lag from my actual counts as folks relied on AQ to post the clues. I post all boxes on both sites equally for the convience of all in regards to recording finds. <br/>
<br/>
 The usage of either site depends on which was mentioned in any local articles that have turned up. LBNA was the site mentioned in my source magazine and it was at about two months after starting this hobby before I registered onto AQ.<br/>

letterboxing. I believe that geocaching included this practice from<br/>
its beginning. There are many, many letterboxers who began collecting<br/>
stamps long before the logging feature ever appeared on LbNA and long<br/>
before Atlas Quest was ever unveiled. <br/>
<br/>
There is also a sizeable number of independent types who don't want to<br/>
share their personal logbook stats with the world at large. As a<br/>
result, the numbers of folks who actually log their finds on one or<br/>
both of the major websites is not an accurate representation of how<br/>
many times a box has actually been found. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I do not choose to keep a public record of my finds. This<br/>
is actually the basis of one of my personal pet peeves. Now that AQ<br/>
allows folks to place a number of finds as one of the optional<br/>
requirements for acquiring a clue, I am excluded from viewing some<br/>
clues. I do have enough finds to qualify but since I don't have an<br/>
electronic logbook I cannot access some clues in areas that I do<br/>
visit, especially NYC. Bummer... Funhog<br/>

The F-1 was created to protect clues from search engine listings.<br/>
Here's a quote from Green Tortuga Message #19990:<br/>
"No search engine that I'm aware of will automatically create an<br/>
account on AQ and record at least one find to start caching clues<br/>
restricted to the F-1 club."<br/>
<br/>
I bet some of those folks with low F count requirements (and maybe<br/>
those with higher F-count requirements) would email you the clues if<br/>
you explained your situation. It's kind of like a WOM. :)<br/>

We have had several non boxers become letterboxers due to their <br/>
googling our clue sheets as well.<br/>
<br/>
While setting clues at F1 or F100 are other ways to play, I wonder <br/>
how many letterboxers would complain if most of the folks with large <br/>
Plant counts set their clue sheets at P100? That too would be <br/>
another way to play.<br/>
<br/>
I just do not understand the exclusionary idea behind F1 or F10000.<br/>
The arguments put forth in past discussions just don't seem to fit <br/>
the concept of letterboxing. Isn't part of the idea to plant a <br/>
letterbox at some really cool spot so you can share that spot? If <br/>
your letterbox is so restrictive then why put it in the public arena <br/>
in the first place? Just keep it WOM.<br/>

only see the three most recent entries.  There may be many more that<br/>
only the box lister can see.  If you are looking at Atlas Quest, you<br/>
can only see the most recent listing and your own find if it isn't the<br/>
most recent one.<br/>
<br/>
It is very different from the geocaching site where everyone seems to<br/>
log every detail of every search, thus often giving a lot of the<br/>
little secrets away.  I know when I do a cache, I make sure to read<br/>
all of the messages because I know that I will get more information<br/>
than I will normally need through them.  Letterbox logging keeps the<br/>
clues pretty pure - you only get what the author wants you to get.<br/>

&gt; log it online, also.  There are always people that don't log online, <br/>
&gt; but still, probably 70-80% of the cachers do log online.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am just curious... and it was a lot of fun to go through and see all <br/>
&gt; of the stamps, and where the people are from.  I'm looking forward to <br/>
&gt; doing more letterboxing when we travel (unfortunately, that isn't <br/>
&gt; often...)  We are also in the process of planning our own letterboxes!<br/>

<br/>
 But the case for mystery boxes from a <br/>
&gt; recent discussion seems to back it up -- those boxes take more <br/>
&gt; effort, but as a result are visited less frequently and usually <br/>
only <br/>
&gt; by somewhat seasoned boxers looking for a different challenge.<br/>
<br/>
Hi QB<br/>
<br/>
I think you answered the "restriction" point of view very nicely. If <br/>
you want to restrict the access do it with some class and <br/>
creativity. Just make the clues a little more obscure or create a <br/>
mystery letterbox. It is just too easy to place an F1, F100 or F1000 <br/>
and where is the ingenuity in that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(How would I know that Funhog visits NYC <br/>
&gt; from time to time, for example?  And what a treat it would be to <br/>
&gt; discover his stamp in one of our boxes.)<br/>
<br/>
She travels far and wide and has "salted" many areas that had no <br/>
letterboxes before her visit.<br/>

experienced boxers never will. Restricting clues in an area with few<br/>
letterboxes would guarantee slower growth of the hobby in your area.<br/>
If there seem to be no boxes to find, folks won't participate. This<br/>
may or may not be a good thing, depending on your goals. <br/>
<br/>
I also believe that letterboxes go missing because they are poorly<br/>
hidden in the first place, confiscated by authorities or removed by<br/>
animals. I have personally lost boxes to all three but I honestly<br/>
doubt that any have been vandalized using a clue. It has happened to<br/>
some boxes that I know of but to so few that it is probably not<br/>
significant. Funhog<br/>

&gt; You'd think the name of the box would come up &amp; then it would say<br/>
&gt; "clue available only after 100 finds" or something.<br/>
<br/>
It used to do that, but then I'd get loads of hate mail saying how<br/>
unfair it was, what a terrible thing it was to restrict clues, blah,<br/>
blah, blah.<br/>
<br/>
Restricted clues have been around since the very begining--AQ just<br/>
created an automated way of restricting them. The fact that there are<br/>
restricted clues never seemed to bother anyone--it's knowing there's a<br/>
clue that they can't access that really gets under people's skin. As<br/>
they say, ignorance is bliss. =)<br/>
<br/>
Thus, I changed the setup towards the ignorance approach. Nobody<br/>
complains to me when they can't access clues they don't know about in<br/>
the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I used to restrict it so clues could only be available to premium<br/>
members, but then I got mail from people saying that it's morally<br/>
wrong to charge for clues. (To which I thought, "Well, then, don't<br/>
list them that way!") Then people would deliberately pester other<br/>
premium members hoping one of them would get the clue for them for free.<br/>
<br/>
So I switched to a different form of restricting clues to get away<br/>
from the stigma of "paying for clues"--and decided on the Dartmoor<br/>
model of restricting clues since it's more "historically correct."<br/>
<br/>
I think the whole complaint about restricting clues is pretty darned<br/>
silly myself. Even if I didn't provide that option on Atlas Quest,<br/>
there would STILL be restricted clues. As it is, less than 2% of the<br/>
clues listed on Atlas Quest are restricted in any way, so you really<br/>
aren't missing much.<br/>

&gt; That would be all well and good if the boxes would even show up on my<br/>
&gt; searches. Since I don't "qualify" they never appear. I only know of<br/>
&gt; the ones in NYC because another boxer told me of them. I have no <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; way of knowing who to contact to ask for clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I heeded the Green Tortuga's message regarding search engines and<br/>
&gt; entered my first find on AQ so that I would have a find count of one.<br/>
&gt; However, the boxes I know that exclude me and others who don't have<br/>
&gt; online logbooks have an F100 requirement...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Wow-I didn't even know there were "F100" boxes. I only just started <br/>
logging stuff in online-I'm too lazy to go back and log my pre-Atlas <br/>
Quest finds. DH suggested doing 10 or so a day (I do have all the <br/>
dates found recorded) but...sounds like too much work. *I* know how <br/>
many boxes I've found, which is all that matters to me.<br/>
<br/>
I *have* emailed some placers for F1 or F10 clues before I logged any <br/>
boxes on Atlas Queat, for example last year before we went to Florida <br/>
I found a box at AT that was my oldest daughter's name. It was only <br/>
for F10 people though. The placer kindly responded to my email, and <br/>
sent me the clues when I explained that I had more than 10 boxes but <br/>
no online logs.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'll log enough on AT to get the F100 boxes to show up!<br/>
