My son, SpaceDAW, and I started a Pokemon theme series a while back that we dubbed ... "Pokey Man".    At the time we "challenged" other letterboxers to add to the collection.  We've lost a few since then but if you are going that route it would be fun, at least for us, if you added to our letterbox collection.<br/>

You know, for some bizarre reason I was bored one day and carved five <br/>
stamps of Pokemon characters.  Now I know absolutely nothing about <br/>
Pokemon.  I can't even tell you the names of these characters!  But <br/>
they looked cute, so I figured I'd carve them.  They really are <br/>
pretty good stamps, but I haven't a clue what to do with them.  I <br/>
can't exactly HIDE them not knowing anything about the characters.  <br/>
I've considered giving them away to kids that might like to have them <br/>
as signature stamps, but then it just seems wrong to have other <br/>
people using MY stamps as signature stamps.  Everyone should be <br/>
carving their own.  So what do I do with these five stamps?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I like the idea of your Pokemon themed box(es), and I'd be <br/>
willing to donate these stamps to such a worthy cause!  Of course, <br/>
I'll NEVER be able to find the stamps myself because I know so little <br/>
about Pokemon, but I like the idea anyhow.  =)<br/>
<br/>
The five that I have are (and since I don't know their names, I'm <br/>
just describing them):<br/>
<br/>
1. Looks like a ball of purple worms<br/>
2. Looks kindof like a seahorse<br/>
3. Looks like a cat with spiked hair<br/>
4. Looks like a turtle of some sort<br/>
5. Not sure what the last one looks like.  A bat, perhaps?  With <br/>
elephant-sized ears that looks like he could fly with.<br/>
