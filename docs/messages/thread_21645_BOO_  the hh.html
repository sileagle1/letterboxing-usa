"Since Nov 26, 2004 I have been waiting and freezing.   I might add <br/>
buried under leaves in the hidden hills of glaciers past.  Why was <br/>
this winter so long and why has no one been to visit me.  Such a sad <br/>
state of affairs that some interloper from Ohio had to rescue me from <br/>
the grips of this terrible Celtic Michigan winter." moaned the frozen <br/>
little hitchhiker named BOO.  <br/>
<br/>
His smile had long since turned to a grimace and all he wants is to <br/>
be warm!  He now believes that hope has arrived and he will be moved <br/>
south, even if it is just to the banks of the Muddy Maumee.  He <br/>
moaned and cried about the chill and the dark and he listened as his <br/>
rescuer chatted to her daughter about finding him.   <br/>
<br/>
"Ahh, she is a box whisperer!" laughed the silly little pumpkin as he <br/>
bumped along in her letterboxing bag.  <br/>
<br/>
"What is this place they were taking me?  Down a long road <br/>
called "eyes eventy five" to a place called sun shinestate?  If it is <br/>
a state of sunshine, maybe it will be warm" cried the dear BOO as he <br/>
softly fell asleep to the rocking of the auto and the warmth of the <br/>
auto's heater.  <br/>
<br/>
And in his little pumpkiny dreams he whispered "Warmer, evermore <br/>
warmer".<br/>
