                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I'm a "newbie" who just started letterboxing in July.  My husband &amp; I <br/>
are having a lot of fun with it and have about 30 "finds" so far <br/>
which includes some travelers and hitchhikers.  We're getting ready <br/>
to place 3 boxes within the next week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately Wisconsin isn't a huge letterboxing state (yet) so I <br/>
decided to contact our local REI store (outdoor recreational <br/>
equipment) and volunteered to give a seminar. They offer free weekly <br/>
seminars on Tuesday evenings that are open to the public. They were <br/>
excited about having a "fresh topic"!  Due to the likelihood of snow <br/>
in our area during the winter months, I decided to schedule the <br/>
seminar in early March when it might be easier for people to actually <br/>
find the boxes.  Of course I'm hoping to generate more awareness &amp; <br/>
interest (i.e. get other people hooked!) so we have more boxes to <br/>
find.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any suggestions for the seminar, please let me know.  <br/>
I'm aware of two major web sites that provide good information<br/>
(www.letterboxing.org and www.letterboxing.info), but am interested <br/>
in any other input you might care to share.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I learned about letterboixng in a magazine.  These are the points that I<br/>
wish I had been emphasized when I wsa starting:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it is important to emphasize the basics--letterboxing needs to be<br/>
done with discretion to prevent careless vandalism (and purposeful<br/>
vandalism ) and that respect needs to be shown to the environment.  You<br/>
might want to consider planting a box or two specifically for the<br/>
event--this has worked well in other areas.  If you go to the archives,<br/>
there has been a thread on intrducing scouts to 'boxing htat had some nice<br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I think a demonstration of stamping in might be useful--sounds silly but it<br/>
was a challenge the first time for my crew, lol.<br/>
<br/>
What to carry in your bag/pack/pocket<br/>
<br/>
Rehiding boxes--I learned alot about this recently.  What seems so obvious<br/>
now, I had never really considered before.<br/>

will help you be a good letterboxing citizen: extra ziplocs, paper <br/>

Will you be at the REI in Milwaukee?  I'd love to see the <br/>
presentation.  Let us know where and when.<br/>
