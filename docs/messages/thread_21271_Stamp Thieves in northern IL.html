Hi<br/>
<br/>
I was allerted that my letterbox was recently attacked by the stamp <br/>
thieves.  They wrote in their note that they thought my box <br/>
was 'lame' and moved the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunetly for me the next letterboxer came by and returned the stamp <br/>
to its proper location.<br/>
<br/>
They did say that they had struck again that I took as this was not <br/>
the first one they had adapted.  The bad news is that the box had no <br/>
logbook so I do not know who the thieves are.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
