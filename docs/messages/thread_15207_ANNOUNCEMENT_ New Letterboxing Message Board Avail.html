                    <div class="plaintext-content">As letterboxing has taken off in the past few years, some new methods<br/>
of passing information have become necessary.  For instance, with the<br/>
increase in new boxes, a new site was developed by Wes Garrison to<br/>
allow placers to add their own clues.  Similarly, the traffic on the<br/>
Yahoo mailing list is becoming overwhelming, and has resulted in some<br/>
frustration and people dropping from the list.  In order to address<br/>
these issues, I have started a message board devoted to letterboxing:<br/>
<br/>
http://pub188.ezboard.com/bletterboxingnorthamerica<br/>
<br/>
On this board, I have tried to create forums for various areas of<br/>
interest, including general letterboxing information, new boxes, box<br/>
reports by region, and events, among others.  Therefore, you will be<br/>
able to read only areas that are interesting to you, without having to<br/>
wade through hundreds of messages.  Also, the message board format<br/>
will allow for threaded topics, keeping related messages together. <br/>
The current structure is just a starting point, and may be changed in<br/>
the future.  <br/>
<br/>
I have set up the board on EZ Boards, which have free accounts for<br/>
anyone to use.  There will never be a fee required for individual use;<br/>
however, after the first month, EZ Board will charge a fee to keep the<br/>
board running.  For example, 6 months of ad-free board use for<br/>
everyone can be purchased for $30, for up to 10,000 page views per<br/>
month.  On other boards, funds have been raised through contributions,<br/>
such as through Pay Pal.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will try the board and make suggestions.  I believe this<br/>
could be a major improvement in communication for the letterboxing<br/>
community.  Thanks.<br/>

Dear Neil and all Else Who Read This,<br/>
<br/>
I see this answering some of the problems we have had. Thank you for <br/>
your efforts. <br/>
<br/>
Will you then also have folk register before they are allowed to <br/>
post? If posters can remain anonymous, then we might be back to the <br/>
same problems we have had with the data base.<br/>
<br/>
I am not certain but I thought that some of the same functions were <br/>
being explored at letterboxing.org. However, I will still post to as <br/>
many places as I can to advertise our Oct 4th SLO Stamping in the <br/>
Meadow event in SLO, CA.<br/>
<br/>
Could you add a California section? We are not the NW nor do we fit <br/>
with the SW very well IMNSHO. Maybe we will just split the state at <br/>
San Francisco. *GRIN*<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the site. It looks very professionally done.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on 'boxing,<br/>
Sir Balthazar<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Very nice!  I belong to a few other bulletin boards set up like this <br/>
one, including my Jeep club's.  It works well for them (there's an OT <br/>
section that gets the most activity). I see this as solving a number <br/>
of problems, and people only have to read what interests them, without <br/>
cluttering up mailboxes.<br/>
<br/>
With nearly 1300 members, I don't think the Yahoo set up quite meets <br/>
all our needs anymore. It was great in the beginning, but IMO, we've <br/>
out-grown it.  But doncha all worry, I'll belong to BOTH. :)<br/>

I've changed the regions a bit to reflect the nine "census divisions"<br/>
(in hopes of avoiding disagreements!)  California is in the<br/>
newly-defined "Pacific" region. :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the site. It looks very professionally done.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Comments and suggestions are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
I hope people will consider posting both here and there for a while,<br/>
in order to get the other board moving.  I see we've been getting some<br/>
visitors, but few posts, and I understand that people might be<br/>
reluctant to post information solely on a new board.<br/>

That's right, Neil.  I am also hesitant to deal with two message <br/>
boards at once, even tho scanning thru several pages of messages <br/>
every day is a (small) nuisance.  Nevertheless, I applaud your <br/>
efforts to make this easier, as we grow ever-larger (nearly 1300 <br/>
group members now !). I haven't yet registered on your site, tho I've <br/>
looked at it.  Still considering . . .  We'll probably discuss this <br/>
at the Ithaca (NY) gathering this weekend.<br/>
