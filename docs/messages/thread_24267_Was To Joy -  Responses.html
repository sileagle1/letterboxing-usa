&gt; You should appreciate the responses that "You" asked for and received.<br/>
&gt; Would you have felt better if your post was ignored? (not looking for <br/>
&gt; any repartee, so no response is necessary)<br/>

question to be likely to start any "stimulating conversation."<br/>
"Controversial" and "stimulating conversation" often go hand in hand.  I<br/>
read your post back then and couldn't come up with much of an answer.  My<br/>
answer would have been that there *is* no perfect hiding spot.  They all<br/>
have their pros and cons depending on each individual situation.  Kind of a<br/>
boring answer.<br/>
<br/>
I can give an opinion on what's *not* a perfect hiding spot:<br/>
<br/>
Inside an airport terminal:<br/>
<br/>
Attached to the electrical box of the county courthouse;<br/>
<br/>
Attached to the underneath of a bridge of a major highway;<br/>
<br/>
Knee-deep in the middle of a patch of poison ivy;<br/>
<br/>
Anyplace within view of the videocameras watching the Sears Tower in<br/>
Chicago;<br/>
<br/>
Velcroed inside the clown's barrel at a rodeo bull-riding competition;<br/>
<br/>
Hidden behind the Mona Lisa;<br/>
<br/>
And with the pipebomb problems we've both in the past and lately, anyplace<br/>
around a Postal facility or Postal collection box, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, anyplace that could end ya up in the pokey or in the<br/>
hospital is *not* the perfect hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess, reversing that, I'd say the perfect hiding spot is anyplace that<br/>
*won't* end ya up in the pokey or in the hospital.  :-)<br/>

spots, but they became "perfect" because one was now<br/>
being guarded by a tremendously beautiful wooly bear<br/>
caterpiller and that made me laugh, the second spot<br/>
was now behind a tangle of spider webs [I called it<br/>
the SPU, Spider Protection Unit], and the third was in<br/>
the middle of an ant highway.<br/>
<br/>
One of my own boxes, a finder told me, was covered in<br/>
slugs.<br/>

Nature helps out with the camo!<br/>

My vote for a NOT perfect spot: A historic [say, Civil<br/>
War] stone wall.  PLEASE, NO!<br/>
