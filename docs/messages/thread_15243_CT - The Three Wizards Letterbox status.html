<br/>
Found the wizards today.  Lovely place to visit.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to update the owner of the box but it is unclaimed on LbNA.  <br/>
(They were planted by B-The Weekend Warrior.)<br/>
<br/>
They are still enjoyable and visitable but need a bit of <br/>
maintanence.  Like 1st wizard's log book full (people are stamping on <br/>
the other side so still okay) no stamp in the 1st box and in the 3rd <br/>
box the black ink is drying out, (can still get an image though).<br/>
<br/>
Still visitable like I said.  The area is peaceful and the meadow is <br/>
so full of blooming wild flowers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Fisher<br/>
