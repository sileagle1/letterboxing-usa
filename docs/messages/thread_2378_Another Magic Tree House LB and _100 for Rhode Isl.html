                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Trish,<br/>
    I'm excited about your last entry, Revolutionary War on Wednesday.<br/>
According to my grandmother's DAR papers, my 5 time great grandfather fought<br/>
as a sergeant  under Brig. Gen. Taylor at New Port in August 1778.  I have a<br/>
definite interest in letterboxing but on my first attempt I failed (South<br/>
Mountain Municipal Park, Phoenix).  But my determination has certainly not<br/>
diminished.  I am a tour conductor and my group will be staying in Newport,<br/>
early October.  I will coax my coach driver to take me the few miles so that<br/>
I can find the letterbox, and I will feel more excited than ever.  Also, on<br/>
your homepage you referred to the Magic Treehouse series.  I volunteer, one<br/>
on one, in the school system reading with elementary kids.  Just so happens<br/>
I have one boy who has completed the series and I've followed along with him<br/>
to all parts of the world.  He'll be the next letterbox fan, I'm sure.<br/>
Thank you, Trish.           Nancy<br/>

&gt;I took advantage of the lightning and pouring rain to place another<br/>
&gt;letterbox in the Magic Tree House Series.  This one is called the<br/>
&gt;Revolutionary War on Wednesday after the book by the same name and is<br/>
&gt;located at the site of the only Revolutionary War land battle in RI.<br/>
