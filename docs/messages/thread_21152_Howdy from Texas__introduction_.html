Howdy!  We are the Milfeld family, in Fort Worth, Texas.  I've been <br/>
carving stamps for 6 months, or so, and letterboxing for just a <br/>
couple.<br/>
<br/>
 I didn't even know what it was until I bought the 2nd season of <br/>
Buffy the Vampire Slayer on DVD.  Joss Whedon's appologized for the <br/>
fact that the series wasn't done in letterboxing.  I didn't know <br/>
what the heck that meant, so I got on the web and looked it up.  I <br/>
found letterboxing.org.  Didn't make a lick of sense where Buffy was <br/>
concerned, but it intrigued me, and so our journey began.  <br/>
<br/>
I met several letterboxers on the trail yesterday, and it turns out <br/>
that they had gotten involved through a gal that had taken one of my <br/>
stamp carving classes.  It's cool to see that interest is spreading <br/>
around here.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I can't wait to get to know ya, and here all of your cool <br/>

Welcome to the group, and to a great pastime. I'll let someone else <br/>

Welcome Sandra<br/>
<br/>
      That is so cool that the letterboxing hobby has grown so much <br/>
that our hobby shows up before the screen sizing in a yahoo search.  <br/>
Anyway welcome from New Orleans and don't forget to check out the <br/>
Texas group page for more information for your area.  I believe <br/>
there is a link to it in the 'Links' section on the left side of <br/>
this page.  Have fun and hope to see you at the Brazos Gathering in <br/>
March. (the park will be full of boxers).<br/>

Hey yoooou guys ..<br/>
<br/>
You have all gone decidedly off topic..but here's my<br/>
two cents worth anyway.<br/>
<br/>
This is WAY, WAY, WAY! off topic. So if you wanna skip<br/>
it stop now ! It's just for fun !<br/>
<br/>
Film was my business for a while so this all made me<br/>
smile.<br/>
<br/>
All this ratio and squeeze stuff is all very<br/>
technical. The domain of the pro cinematographer, and<br/>
the lighting cameraman, you know, those guys outa work<br/>
because of CGI ! (Computer graphics to you and me!)<br/>
<grin><br/>
<br/>
The photographic technology is actually called<br/>
anamorphics which sounds kinda medical <grin><br/>
<br/>
and it can get very deep.<br/>
<br/>
CinemaScope is 3.66:1 and ToddAO is different and 16:9<br/>
is different and Cinerama was huge and now there is<br/>
even IMAX !! heck it is a nightmare<br/>
<br/>
Many films are shot on 1.55:1 these days (That's a 2x<br/>
Squeeze ratio ! <uh??>). <br/>
<br/>
Just look at the stuff written on the back of your DVD<br/>
boxes !<br/>
<br/>
The real question no-one has addressed is why it's<br/>
called "Letterboxing" in the first place ! (that's the<br/>
interesting bit actually) <br/>
<br/>
The answer (oh yes I know that too) is NOT that it<br/>
looks like the slot in your door for the mail man, if<br/>
you have one. (Most British people do and it is a<br/>
British English phrase in the first place).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even their public mail boxes (called pillar boxes )<br/>
have a horizontal slot for mail<br/>
<br/>
Hence the "letterbox" slot !<br/>
<br/>
Film Letterboxing is a term about this tiny slot<br/>
shape!<br/>
<br/>
If a widescreen film is shown on a home TV which is<br/>
about two feet wide then the picture when shown wide<br/>
as intended is black top and bottom to get the whole<br/>
image in side to side <phew>, and so is finally too<br/>
d**n small to see and enjoy !<br/>
<br/>
Hence like looking at a letterbox slot ! <br/>
<br/>
Sure you can pan and scan and all that stuff, but in<br/>
the end it's trying to fit a quart into a pint pot. <br/>
It can't be done !<br/>
<br/>
The real answer is that "letterboxing" is (also) a<br/>
derogatory film industry word for TV trying to emulate<br/>
film media !<br/>
<br/>
Widescreen images were and ARE meant to be seen on a<br/>
big screen. Make that a ""BIG"" screen.<br/>
<br/>
Peering at a small cut off slot picture on your TV is<br/>
kinda..er excuse me...well er...stoopid eh ?<br/>
<br/>
Widescreen films weren't made for tiny TV images.<br/>
<br/>
Not even the (big bucks) home plasma TV's .<br/>
<br/>
Look at the price of a 42 inch (diagonal) plasma TV.<br/>
Gulp !<br/>
<br/>
And believe me they  are really only a small image!!<br/>
<br/>
Get out grandpas old home movie screen you'll see what<br/>
I mean ! They were often 5 or six feet wide ! <br/>
<br/>
That's 60 inch or 72 inch horizontal...<br/>
<br/>
Or in TV language 75 or 90 inch diagonal The whole<br/>
image, not including the plastic frame!! <br/>
<br/>
And that was HOME movies !!<br/>
<br/>
Widescreen films in fact are not even made for the<br/>
multiplex screen, but for the  "showcase cinemas" with<br/>
vast silver expanses and 22 channel sound.<br/>
<br/>
Heck then you see the picture as the cameraman (sorry<br/>
cameraperson) and director intended.<br/>
<br/>
But when did you last go to a showcase cinema???<br/>
<br/>
Unless you go to see the Oscars Shows or the Canne<br/>
film festival or live in a big city they are few and<br/>
far between, and the broadcast image is just too poor,<br/>
even digital to get it to you as intended.<br/>
<br/>
So well......<br/>
<br/>
That's it .<br/>
<br/>
It is a compromise. And yeah I watch letterbox<br/>
pictures too.  I prefer carving setting out and<br/>
hunting letterboxes though <grin><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally !!! <br/>
<br/>
And as to understanding the universe<br/>
<br/>
Douglas Adams eat your heart out.<br/>
<br/>
It was Arthur C Clarke who wrote it first in a book<br/>
about IBM engineers (remember when that was a US<br/>
company!!) They used a big <grin> computer and were<br/>
calculating all the names of God in order to offer all<br/>
the possible prayers.  That (Arthur says) is the<br/>
purpose of man.<br/>
<br/>
So when they had done this they got kinda scared !!! <br/>
<br/>
"Hey guys what happens now ?"<br/>
<br/>
The last lines of the book were something like, "And<br/>
one by one, without any fuss the stars started going<br/>
out" <br/>
<br/>
So before it gets dark............<br/>
<br/>
I'm back into my shack away from normal people again<br/>
to carve me an IMAX stamp 80 feet high by 190 feet<br/>
wide <br/>
<br/>
...put that in your collectors book !.......<br/>

&gt; Letterboxing is when they reduce  film format (16:9)<br/>
&gt; to a regular TV image<br/>
&gt; format (4:3) by putting black bars at the top and<br/>
&gt; bottom. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; FYI, "letterboxing" also refers to a particular<br/>
&gt; &gt; filmography method, but I have no idea what it is.<br/>
&gt;  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have a news alert set to send me a link for any<br/>
&gt; &gt; reference to letterboxing that comes up on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; internet, and I more often than not get the cinema<br/>
&gt; &gt; references than our "letterboxing".<br/>

&gt; Howdy!  We are the Milfeld family, in Fort Worth, Texas.  I've <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; carving stamps for 6 months, or so, and letterboxing for just a <br/>
&gt; couple.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  I didn't even know what it was until I bought the 2nd season of <br/>
&gt; Buffy the Vampire Slayer on DVD.  Joss Whedon's appologized for <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; fact that the series wasn't done in letterboxing.  I didn't know <br/>
&gt; what the heck that meant, so I got on the web and looked it up.  I <br/>
&gt; found letterboxing.org.  Didn't make a lick of sense where Buffy <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; concerned, but it intrigued me, and so our journey began.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I met several letterboxers on the trail yesterday, and it turns <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; that they had gotten involved through a gal that had taken one of <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; stamp carving classes.  It's cool to see that interest is <br/>
spreading <br/>
&gt; around here.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I can't wait to get to know ya, and here all of your cool <br/>
&gt; stories.<br/>
