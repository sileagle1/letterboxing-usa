<br/>
<br/>Jkid's Letterbox
<br/>Clara Barton National Historic Site 
<br/>Bethesda Maryland
<br/>Montgomery County. 
<br/>
<br/>Planted by Jkid, Cheese, Monkey, Comet, and Toasty 
<br/>Difficulty:  Easy---a drive-by
<br/>Planted 1/12/03
<br/>
<br/>Take McArthur Blvd. Toward Washington D.C. Turn right at Glen Echo/Clara Barton national historic site.  Park at the 1st small parking lot. Stand and face the handicapped parking space. Take 33 steps toward the left until you get to the walkway with the sign that says 5801. Follow the walkway until you see a right turn in the walk way. Take the right turn to the gravel walk way. Turn left and follow it around until you get to the far right corner of the Clara Barton Historical Site house. Continue on the gravel driveway, going to your right, for about 10 steps.  Look left until you see a small garden and three stones piled on top of each other…under the three stones is what you seek.<br/><br/>Contact us at McKewen2 @ aol.com<br/></body></html>

                    <html><body>Sorry for the confusion over this box!  Jkid is 9 years old and loves to go 'boxing with us, but his parents haven't been letterboxing and didn't quite know how to help him get the clues complete (or what to plant it in).  After we posted the clues we went to find it but couldn't (we went all around the house but didn't go right on the gravel driveway).  So we went back the next day with Jkid who showed us where it is and we then sent in the corrected clues.  I think this means that we helped on the planting end, so you should count it as a "first finder."
<br/>
<br/>I don't think it will last too long, since I think they will find it when they do a spring clean-up at Clara Barton, but Jkid had fun carving and hiding, which is the important thing!

<br/>Stay warm!  Shoo</body></html>
