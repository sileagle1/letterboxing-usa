<div>Dear Letterboxers,</div>
<div>    Thank you to all the letterboxers who have shown interest in 
    the prison guard position.  Hopefully all of you who 
    applied early 
    have had a chance to search out the prisoner.  For those of you still 
    interested in a position at Old New-Gate, we have a case for you to start 
    work on as soon as possible.</div>
<div>    Last night a prisoner escaped.  Upon inspection of his cell, we 
    found a letter that might help you track him down.  I have enclosed a 
    copy of the letter for you to use to start your search.  Good Luck and 
    welcome to the New-Gate Team!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>                                                
    Sincerely,</div>
<div>

<p align="left">My Dearest Robert</p>,
<p align="left">Oh how I miss you so. The last 5 months have 
    been so difficult to endure without you. No man should have to spend all of 
    his days locked up underground in that damp, dark, dungeon. But, there is no 
    need to worry, I have been talking to some women, new friends of mine, and I 
    have a plan that will allow us to be together again.</p>
<p align="left">I am sure you have heard stories of other 
    prisoners escaping overnight. While it remains a mystery to most people, I 
    know their secret of how they escaped. She is called the dark lady of New 
    Gate, I cannot mention her real name, but it is she who will help you to 
    freedom. Before I share with you the details of the plan, I must mention to 
    you that I have recovered your copper coins, and have hidden them safely in 
    the nearby forest.</p>
<p align="left">Now for the plan. Late Sunday night, when all 
    the other prisoners have drifted off to sleep, you will sneak down the 
    tunnel that leads to the spring. You may have noticed that the shaft, while 
    quite deep, has an opening above. This opening is surrounded by a well where 
    the master and others retrieve their water. When the moon is high, the Dark 
    Lady will lower the bucket. Tug the bucket three times, and she will raise 
    you to the surface. She will disappear immediately, so don’t waste any 
    time looking for her.</p>
<p align="left">I have carefully planned your escape route to 
    minimize the risk of your being caught by the authorities. I have also 
    hidden along the route some things that you will need. Once you are above 
    ground you must move quickly to avoid being seen. </p>Head south down NewGate Road for about 
    1 mile until you reach a path named for the Indian Metacomet. Climb up the steep hill and head north along the ridge. After 15-20 
    minutes you will see to your right, a strange fenced in area like you have never seen before. I think perhaps it is some sort of 
    experimental prison, so don’t linger too long. Just before you get to 
    this fenced in building, there will be on your left, a large fallen tree. It 
    is about 2 feet in diameter and about twenty-five feet long. Go around to 
    the back and find some clothes, food, and a compass hidden under a piece of 
    bark, tucked beneath the log, about half-way down. 
<p align="left">Quickly, continue north on the 
    path. There will be views of the village below to the west, but don’t 
    waste any time enjoying them. You will see some local deviants have written 
    "copper" on a rock in the path. Soon, you will see another path on 
    your right. This is blazed with red marks, and goes into the unknown. Do not 
    follow it! Stay with the blue blazes that have been left on the trees. Climb 
    up the rocks to an amazing view, you will see New-Gate at 330 degrees. There 
    are disks in the stone marking this high point. From Copper marker number 1, 
    follow the trail for 28 paces. Then, walk off trail east 5 paces to a ledge 
    outcrop. Climb down about 6 feet to the base to find a lantern to light your 
    way.</p>
<p align="left">The next stop will be about 20 minutes from 
    here and also the hardest to find. Keep your eyes open and be careful! 
    Continue north on the rocky ridge past another strange enclosure. Bear left 
    on the blue path, past another view. You will come to a rocky ledge with a 
    tree growing, surrounded by strange rock. Go down hill and back into the 
    woods. You should come to another large rocky, lookout. You will know you 
    are at the correct lookout if there is a silo at 330 degrees, and at 220 
    degrees Talcot Mountain (which by the way, would make a lovely spot for a 
    tower). Shortly after that (maybe two minutes later) look for a small 
    clearing to the west, on the edge of a drop off. There will be a lone white 
    pine standing in the center of it. From this pine walk 20 paces at 80 
    degrees to a large double trunk oak. Behind this oak, under some rocks, I 
    have hidden your stash of copper coins.</p>
<p align="left"></p>Now, you will continue north on your path to your final 
    stop. The trail will dip and then rise to enter a hemlock forest. At the end 
    of the hemlock grove, where the trail turns right and starts to drop into 
    predominantly hardwood forest once again you will find a spot to the left 
    where 2 fallen trees cross. As you know, X marks the spot! This is where I 
    will have a horse waiting for you. Once you are here take the horse and ride 
    off to the north. The trail continues to Massachusetts and even further 
    north to New Hampshire. When you have found a safe place to reside, write me 
    and I will join you. 
<p align="left">Please, leave me a short note at each spot to 
    let me know you have escaped safely. I cannot wait to see you. Be safe and 
    be wary of the guards and deputies who will be looking for you. </p>

<p>Abigail</p></div>
