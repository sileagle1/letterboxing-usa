One word of caution on mixing disc golf with letterboxing. Our Golf Stamp series started out at a Disc Golf venue ,and when we went back on the second day to double check directions we found that one box had disappeared and we found another with a shredded stamp. We moved the location. I think it is a turf thing so we found our own turf. <br/>
