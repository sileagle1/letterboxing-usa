the East Coast Meet/Greet. If she had we would never have spent such <br/>
a wonderful day together, yesterday. What a CRAZY group we make. We <br/>
were having such a good time talking and walking that we almost <br/>
forgot to plant the boxes! <br/>
   When planting the first box we stumbled across a geocache that was <br/>
occupying the spot we had chosen. This was the girls first experience <br/>
with a geocache. Trinkets and toys what fun! Luckily I keep stuff <br/>
like that to exchange in my backpack. We took the snake (mine now) <br/>
and left a butterfly bookmark, stuffed toy mouse and a marble. <br/>
Firefly wrote in the notebook. Then a little farther down the trail <br/>
we trip over 2 benchmarks.  This led to, do we count them or not? My <br/>
answer is why not! I count Lizards! Dog Scouts count Attempts. Some <br/>
people count HH's seperate from their finds. And then we have Apple <br/>
Dumpling Gang counting The Turtle and me on a Wall among other <br/>
strange counts of theirs. It's all in good fun. So count away!<br/>
   Tammy, it is a wonderful story. I think it needs another chapter. <br/>
I can't wait till we do it again. It can even be in another park. <br/>
That would be cool! A novel that encompasses 3 states. WOW, what a <br/>
concept. To all of you out there we claim first rights! <br/>
   Squirrel, it was a pleasure!<br/>
   Firefly, I definitly feel upside down today!  GO RAVENS<br/>
   ADG, all 3 of you keep me laughing. Good thing these parks have <br/>
rest rooms. And to think that I'm the one that is supposed to be <br/>
psycho?!!!!   THE END<br/>
