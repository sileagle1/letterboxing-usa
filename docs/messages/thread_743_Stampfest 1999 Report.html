<br/>
As promised here is the scoop on this year's Stampfest.  Below is the<br/>
article that I wrote for the Society for Caligraphers Bulletin.  In addition<br/>
to what I wrote below a couple of the Stampfesters added a little more<br/>
dimension to the Letterboxing experience.  Some of them used a different<br/>
image to stamp into each of the differens boxes.  Someone else wrote a Haiku<br/>
poem for each box.  Everyone that went hunting had a great time and wanted<br/>
to continue this as a new tradition at Stampfest, and a few will be checking<br/>
into the Letterboxing site to get more involved. <br/>
<br/>
Stampfest 2000 will be the weekend before Thanks Giving again, 11/17-11/20. <br/>
You can also go up a day early 11/16 and stay a day longer 11/21 if you<br/>
would like to spend some time hanging out in the Santa Barbara area.  Work<br/>
space won't be available for those extra days.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanks Giving everyone!!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

STAMPFEST 1999<br/>
<br/>
by Wendy Gault<br/>
<br/>
This year's Stampfest theme focused on sculpting with fabric.  Using a<br/>
free-form quilting technique, found objects, beads, stamping, painting , and<br/>
transferring images on fabric, Stampfesters created whimsical soft art. <br/>
Teesha Moore provided the inspirational instruction, materials, and lots of<br/>
encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
The first slide show of the week end was a collaboration between Teesha and<br/>
Tracy Moore on journaling.  The focus was on inspiring Stampfesters to find<br/>
their journaling voices by finding what works with your lifestyle and<br/>
sensibilities.  For example, Teesha creates her art on the pages (leaving<br/>
spaces to write) at home (her desk sounds like a fascinating place to<br/>
create).  She writes while she is out and about waiting for her kids at<br/>
their numerous activities.  Tracy on the other hand will go to a coffee shop<br/>
(or other favorite hang-outs) with all his creative paraphernalia,<br/>
spread-out on the table and create (leaving quite an eclectic mess for the<br/>
bus boy).  He also gets any interested coffee shop goer to join him in the<br/>
mess and create their own works of art.  Both Teesha and Tracy are<br/>
wonderfully generous in sharing their journals, techniques, and enthusiasm. <br/>

<br/>
Other slide shows included wonderfully inspirational lettering art by many<br/>
of your friends, and the always irreverent "Mona" slide show.<br/>
<br/>
Show and tell by attending Stampfesters, this weekend included shapes in<br/>
oragami demonstration by Cindy Fox.  She uses these geometric shapes to<br/>
create cards, ornaments and jewelry.  She also shared many "negative space"<br/>
engineered cards created for her family and friends.  June Munger showed us<br/>
a wonderfully dimensional star book filled with pictures from last year's<br/>
Stampfest, another demonstration of creative engineering with paper.  Kate<br/>
Lyon (a first timer to Stampfest) showed us how to make a tiny oragami book<br/>
that can also doubles as a paper locket filled with treasures.  Wendy Gault<br/>
introduced the Stampfesters to Letterboxing (a hobby that combines rubber<br/>
stamp carving with treasure hunting and hiking), by "planting" Letterboxes<br/>
around La Casa de Maria for Stampfesters to hunt throughout the weekend. <br/>

<br/>
All in all another fabulous Stampfest created by Kat Okamoto and friends. <br/>
If you are interested in joining us in all the laughter, inspiration and<br/>
submerge in co-mingled creative juices at La Casa de Maria, Montecito for<br/>
next year's Stampfest contact Kat Okamoto at A Stamp In The Hand, (310)<br/>
