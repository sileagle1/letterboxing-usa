                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>The weather was perfect for fall hiking today, wasn't it? We thought that we might finally meet other boxers on the trail. Guess we went to the wrong part of CT. &lt;g&gt; We visited a bunch of boxes today. In no particular order:
<br/>
<br/>Fishers of Men: We just barely made it to the hatchery before they closed for the day, so we didn't get to explore much. Had enough time to look around, stamp in, and get out. Quick and simple box, no problems.
<br/>
<br/>Timothy Grass: Found the box after going down the wrong diagonal trail. The box itself was in great shape, and once you are on the right trail, the directions are perfect.
<br/>
<br/>Cedar Hill Cemetary: Great series, wonderful cemetary full of interesting historical figures and some very impressive monuments. All boxes in place and intact.
<br/>
<br/>Jonathan's Dream: Spent so much time here with the kids that we almost didn't make it to the hatchery. :-)  It didn't take too long to find the box. Be careful here, this park is popular!
<br/>
<br/>Elizabeth Park: Very nice park. I swear someone parked near to where the box was just to try to see what we were doing.  &lt;g&gt;  When we left, he did too, so he probably didn't care that much. This box was by far the most popular and most visited of all of the ones we did today. If you haven't been yet, when you get there, you'll see why. :-)
<br/>
<br/>Hopefully, I'll get the time off from work to make it to Kids Day. ::Fingers Crossed::
<br/>
<br/>I hate working weekends! :-P
