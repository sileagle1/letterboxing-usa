                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is with a heavy heart that I find myself involved in yet another <br/>
imbroglio on this List.  However, as a fellow Texan and letterboxing <br/>
friend of Barefoot Lucy, I am duty bound to defend her.  Let it never <br/>
be said that chivalry is dead!<br/>
<br/>
First of all Inspector Bacon, I must say that I have not been <br/>
impressed by your shotgun approach to solving this crime.  Casting <br/>
blame without facts is beneath you and indicates a lack of <br/>
information resulting in desperation.  Your great, great, great, <br/>
great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather, Sir Francis <br/>
Bacon, who was a proponent of a planned procedure of investigating <br/>
called the Scientific Method, must be turning over in his grave.  <br/>
Your father, the Honorable Macon Bacon, must feel ashamed at your ham-<br/>
handed approach to this situation.  And speaking of ham, I'm sure <br/>
your distant relative, the esteemed letterboxer Funhog, is trying <br/>
desperately to increase her distance from you and this entire pig sty <br/>
you have created.<br/>
<br/>
In response to your accusation that BL is responsible for the theft <br/>
of the Store of Good Manners, I say "In a pig's eye"!  She is one of <br/>
the most beloved and respected members of the letterboxing community, <br/>
and the thought of her even being considered as a suspect in this <br/>
crime is repugnant.  Her heart is as big as Texas and her compassion <br/>
for fellow boxers, along with countless hours helping scouts, has <br/>
earned her the nickname "The Barefoot Den Mother of Texas".  She even <br/>
has a letterbox dedicated to her.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is true she is a little rough around the edges, but what self-<br/>
respecting country girl wouldn't be?  In the early days, Texas women <br/>
had to be tough to survive, and that trait continues as a badge of <br/>
honor.  However, it is a mistake to equate toughness with <br/>
impropriety.  There is not a dishonest bone in her body, except maybe <br/>
her feet when it comes to shoes, but that is to help her be stealthy <br/>
when hunting boxes, not to steal them.  <br/>
<br/>
As to her letterboxing manners, I must say that she exhibits <br/>
exemplary behavior there, too.  She respects nature and is a strong <br/>
proponent of "Leave No Trace", especially when it comes to leaving a <br/>
letterbox better hidden than when she found it.  On most of my clues <br/>
I end with a plea to "Please re-cover well", and she takes this <br/>
literally.  On at least 2 occasions that I know of, she has gone out <br/>
of her way to re-cover a well that was near a box, possibly saving <br/>
many boxers from drowning!  I also concur with her statement that she <br/>
is diligent about keeping her boxes maintained and clues updated.  So <br/>
far I have found 28 of her boxes, and not one of them was missing or <br/>
out of place.  I submit that she has no motive for stealing Good <br/>
Manners since she already possesses them.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, I reiterate that Barefoot Lucy is innocent of all <br/>
charges and I sincerely hope my testimony has shown that she is <br/>
incapable of any crime, let alone this one.  So, Bacon Boy, unless <br/>
you want to join the ranks of your lesser brethren and become known <br/>
as Turkey Bacon, I suggest you apologize to BL and aim your shotgun <br/>
elsewhere.  Just remember, as the University Of TX alma mater <br/>
says, "The eyes of Texas are upon you"!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Silver Eagle<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And since I am sure you are not yet convinced of my innocence, I <br/>
suppose I<br/>
&gt; am going to have to embarrass myself further and ask my <br/>
letterboxing mentor<br/>
&gt; to speak on my behalf.   Certainly if you can't believe me when I <br/>
say I am<br/>
&gt; innocent, you will believe Silver Eagle  a true gentleman of <br/>
letterboxing<br/>
&gt; and an example to us all and the one who, along with his brother <br/>
Baby Bear,<br/>
&gt; has taught me everything I know about genteel letterboxing.   I <br/>
apologize,<br/>
&gt; Silver Eagle, for putting you in this position, but this relentless<br/>
&gt; Inspector Gadget will not believe that I hold dear good <br/>
letterboxing manners<br/>
&gt; unless someone of your caliber speaks on my behalf.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
