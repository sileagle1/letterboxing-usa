<p>Nearest Town: Olympia, WA <br/>County: Thurston <br/>Placed: 11-30-02 </p>
<p>Placed By: Fudrick <br/>Clues: Trivial <br/>Trek: Easy, a driveby </p>
<p>The new Thurston County Courthouse was built on one of the prime view 
locations overlooking Budd Bay, the Capital Building, and Olympia. Why the 
location was not used for high-priced condos is unknown. </p>
<p>Steve "Z" Zimmerman was the Deputy Administrative Officer for Thurston 
County. He was liked and respected by his co-workers. A fast acting cancer was 
discovered, he did not last long. He is missed. This box was placed in his 
memory.</p><b>
</b><p>To The Trailhead: From I-5 take Exit 104 to US-101. Take the first exit 
off US 101 (Crosby and Cooper Point Roads). Turn right and turn right at the 
first light (at the AM-PM). Take the second left, Lakeridge Drive, the road to 
the Thurston County Courthouse. Enter the Courthouse Parking Lot, take the first 
right and go straight down to the viewpoint. Parking should be available.</p>
<p>WARNING: If you are heading Northbound on I-5, you will need to merge across 
two lanes of traffic to get to the first exit. If traffic is heavy, take it easy 
and go to the second exit, Black Lake Boulevard. Turn right, turn right at the 
first light, turn left at the second light (at the AM-PM), and you are back on 
track.</p>
<p>WARNING: The Thurston County Courthouse is a busy place during "normal 
working hours", and the Sheriff’s Office and Jail are 24 hour operations. The 
box is located where hard working County employees might see you, if they took 
the time to look out their window. Be diligent :-)</p><b>
</b><p>To The Letterbox; . Park in the lot and go out to the view point. Enjoy 
the vista. When you leave, walk westerly along the parking lot curb to the Steve 
"Z" Zimmerman memorial. If you were observant, you noted a stand of trees 
blocking your view of Budd Bay. Hidden in there was a stump with a ‘hip pocket’ 
where Z can enjoy the view. </p><i>

yesterday but the clues will come in several days.  I can't mention <br/>
where--that will come in time but it's a nice place to visit.  I <br/>
also won't get credit for placing it, so you'll have to keep on your <br/>
toes when the clues do get posted so you don't miss it.  ;)<br/>

NOT FAIR!!!  You dont have mulitple children to wake, feed, <br/>
dress, and get into the family truckster.  We got there at 8:50am <br/>
and had already been scooped!<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the Trial and Error stamp (which was in the wrong <br/>
end of the log book) there was a Hoopoe Bird spotted there too.  <br/>
However, we were not as early as that bird and was only the 3rd <br/>
to log in.  We did, however, beat Bethany to the box which is quite <br/>
an accomplishment--non-boxing visitors or not!<br/>

Thanks for the nice compliment.  We'll try to find the box sometime <br/>
soon.  Still entertaining folks here!  But, then again, if you look <br/>
through the history of my letterbox finds, most of my letterboxing <br/>
pursuits or placements actually occur during the weekdays--either to <br/>
avoid crowds or, better yet, for crowds to avoid 'my extremely well-<br/>
behaved children'. LOL  Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!!!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails soon (I hope), I'm going cold turkey right now <br/>
not being able to look for letterboxes this weekend...<br/>

those who are slow-er).  LOL  Found a little Buzz-y friend at the <br/>
courthouse in Olympia today.  We also saw proof that the 7th Nail <br/>
exists!!!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     What an absolutely gorgeous view, too!!!  A fitting tribute to <br/>
who I am sure was a great man!!!  <br/>
<br/>
     Also, our excitement piqued a bit today as we thought we were <br/>
going to get another exchange today when immediately after we <br/>
finished stamping into the 'Z' LB and were in the process of <br/>
departing the area another person drove up and went straight to the <br/>
letterbox--but, alas, no exchange credit as we had already exchanged <br/>
our stamps during the 2 Nov SSLQF at Ft Steilacoom.<br/>
<br/>
     We also took the opportunity to attempt to repair the Olympia <br/>
Brew Haus stamp by adding a wooden backing to it.  Don't know why it <br/>
failed so quickly and how long it will last with its new backing.  I <br/>
won't be using the Speed Ball carving medium anymore (fortunately <br/>
I've only placed a handful of LBs out there using that material).  <br/>
It doesn't last very long because it's so crumbly--I'm sticking with <br/>
the PZ Kut or my classic $ store erasers...  They seem to last MUCH <br/>
longer and survive moist &amp; cold environments.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing!<br/>

The white stuff Speedball puts out seems to be pretty crumbly, but <br/>
their infamous "pink stuff" seems to be impervious to anything.  I <br/>
recently checked on my very first box I ever placed (way back in <br/>
April of 2001), and the stamp is still holding up well.  <br/>
<br/>
The white stuff MasterCarve puts out seems to be pretty durable as <br/>
well, and it's thick as a Sunday newspaper so backings aren't the <br/>
least bit needed.  That's what I used for the event stamp at the <br/>
South Sound Quest Fest, and it was so thick I was able to carve both <br/>
sides!  (Good thing too, given the spelling mistake on the one <br/>
side....)<br/>

Thanks for the info!  Yes, from the boxes I have found so far none <br/>
of the pink stamps have had any crumbling 'issues', nor have any <br/>
stamps made out of the extra thick stuff.  Since I have 4 sheets of <br/>
the PZKut left, I'll be using that for a long while--especially if I <br/>
keep placing microboxes these days.  I'm running out of local places <br/>
to hide the 'big' letterboxes these days, hence the dearth of 'micro-<br/>
letterboxes' of late...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

Wow!  First guess!!  His name is Cory and has always been <br/>
Corn Dog to our  cousins in Oregon.  Did the stamp for him over <br/>
Thanksgiving kind of as a joke.  He is 'into' rap music.  We will <br/>
probably re-do the stamp as the dog pictured is kind of feminine <br/>
for such a handsome young man.  Also the corn dog is kind of <br/>
obscure.  Maybe an ear of corn and 2 bulldogs between the E.  <br/>
<br/>
Great Guess!<br/>

so, what stamp did he put in that log?).  <br/>
