<p>Two Boxes placed on June 28, 2002 by Little La 
and Bonsai!<span>  </span>Plan to spend about an 
hour and a half on relatively easy trails.<span>  
</span>Things can get a bit mucky in spots, so don’t wear your best shoes!<span>  </span>There are many rocky ledges that make 
nice spots to swim when it’s not too crowded.<span>  </span>I like to bring a raft and float around 
on a hot summer afternoon, though the walk is also very beautiful in the winter 
when everything is covered in snow and the water has turned to ice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pattaconk Reservoir is within Cockaponset State 
Forest, which encompasses a large amount of land through the towns of Chester, 
Higganum, and Haddam.<span>  </span>The forest 
has many lovely trails, most of which are so little visited that we have walked 
for many miles without seeing any other adventurers.<span>  </span>Because the forest has several entry 
points, unused trails, and few landmarks I recommend bringing a compass and 
trail map for longer forays.<span>  </span>The 
Reservoir walk sticks to the southern end of the Forest, on clearly marked 
trails.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Take exit 6 off Route 9.<span>  </span>Head west on Route 148 about a mile and 
a half.<span>  </span>Just past the Cedar lake 
beach area take a right (there’ll be a sign for Pattaconk and Cedar lake boat 
access).<span>  </span>Follow this bumpy road 
about a mile past Cedar lake and into the State Forest.<span>  </span>Turn left at the “Pattaconk” entry 
sign.<span>  </span>Go past the small beach area 
and park in the lot up the hill (on the right).<span>  </span></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>At the western end of the parking lot follow the 
trail leading into the woods.<span>  </span>Get 
on the Blue trail by turning right, then right again.<span>  </span>Head towards the reservoir.<span>  </span>There are many side trails, but just 
stick with the Blue trail.<span>  </span>Follow 
the Blue trail to the left at the “Red Maple” sign.<span>  </span>The trail meanders through a swampy area 
and goes up the hill that overlooks the western side of the lake.<span>  </span>You will pass by the first “wall”<span>  </span>(really just a natural rock outcropping 
that looks a lot like a stacked rock wall) as you climb up the hill.<span>  </span>Not too far ahead you’ll come to a true 
New England stonewall.<span>  </span>Take 13 
steps up hill and find “The Wall” letterbox hidden towards the bottom of the 
rocks.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Continue on the Blue, passing by a small stream, 
until you come to an arch shaped wooden footbridge that crosses a larger 
stream.<span>  </span>At the bridge turn about 
face and walk to the Blue with a Red dot trail to your left.<span>  </span>Follow the Blue/Red trail as it clings 
to the shore of the reservoir.<span>  </span>The 
trail turns away from the water for a short while to go around a boggy section 
(this is where it can be quite mucky) then heads back around the inlet towards 
the reservoir.<span>  </span>Once you have come 
through this boggy/rocky section and have come to the other side of the little 
inlet you’ll see a tree marked “Basket Oak” on your right.<span>  </span>If you take any of the myriad shortcuts 
off the Blue/Red trail you won’t see this sign.<span>  </span>Facing the sign, walk 15 paces at 
approximately 100 degrees toward a medium sized boulder near the water.<span>  </span>Look to the bottom of this boulder for 
“The Lake” letterbox (though it’s really not a lake; reservoir was too hard to 
carve!).</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Follow the Blue/Red trail back to the beach area 
and parking lot.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p></div></body></html>
