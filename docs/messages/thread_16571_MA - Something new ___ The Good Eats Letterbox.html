The Good Eats Letterbox<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
Approximate Time: 20 minutes (excluding stamping time)<br/>
Clue difficulty: Easy<br/>
Hike difficulty: Easy<br/>
<br/>
The Good Eats Letterbox is a cuisine-oriented letterbox.  Every two to<br/>
three months the letterbox will feature a new cuisine and a new stamp<br/>
for that cuisine.  In addition to the normal stamp-in procedure,<br/>
fellow letterboxers are requested to enter into the logbook one or<br/>
more of their favorite restaurants that serve the featured cuisine.<br/>
Of course people stamping in will want to jot down the selected<br/>
recommendations into their own logbook as well.  Recommendations may<br/>
be for local or distant places.  This will keep the information<br/>
interesting to a broad range of folks.<br/>
<br/>
Please include the following information in the restaurant<br/>
recommendations that you write.<br/>
<br/>
  Name of the restaurant, <br/>
  Location (Town/City, State), <br/>
  Expense Rating (See table below).<br/>
<br/>
You may also wish to recommend the particular dishes you most enjoy<br/>
and other tips.<br/>
<br/>
                    Expense Rating     Cost<br/>
                    ------------------------------<br/>
                    $                  Under $10<br/>
                    $$                 $10 - $15<br/>
                    $$$                $15 - $25<br/>
                    $$$$               Over $25<br/>
<br/>
where Cost is the cost of a typical entree'.<br/>
<br/>
The idea for this letterbox was inspired, in part, by the Tree For All<br/>
Seasons letterbox which offered a different stamp image for each<br/>
season.  I liked the concept of a letterbox that kept offering<br/>
something new.  I'd like to hear feedback from folks on this concept.<br/>
I'm not sure what the ideal frequency will be for changing the<br/>
featured cuisine, and I may want to tweak the requested info. a bit<br/>
as we go along, of course recommendations for the next cuisine to<br/>
feature are also welcome.<br/>
<br/>
The current featured cuisine is:  Seafood<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The Good Eats Letterbox is located at the Guggins Brook Conservation<br/>
in Acton, MA.  To get to this conservation area take I-495 to exit 28<br/>
(Harvard, Boxborough exit).  Head east on Rt. 111 for 2.8 miles from<br/>
the exit.  After passing the "Entering Acton" sign on the right you'll<br/>
cross over a small brook.  There are guard rails on both sides of the<br/>
road here.  The Guggins Brook Conservation Area is immediately after<br/>
this brook on the left-hand (North) side of the road.  The entrance is<br/>
marked by a sign reading "Googins Brook Conservation Area Fort Pond<br/>
Brook Greenbelt".  Turn in here and park.<br/>
<br/>
At the trail head is a bulletin board area with some trail maps in a<br/>
box.  You may want to take one of these along with you for the walk.<br/>
If you do, please return it to the box at the end of your walk.  It's<br/>
also online at:<br/>
http://town.acton.ma.us/LSCOM/MapGugginsBrook.htm.<br/>
<br/>
Take the red blazed trail to the left of the bulletin board.  <br/>
<br/>
Cross over a short (6 foot) bridge (not on the trail map).<br/>
<br/>
When a trail enters on the left (both trails here are yellow blazed),<br/>
go straight. Pass a young American Elm on the left (marked by a tag).<br/>
<br/>
Cross over a long crooked bridge.<br/>
<br/>
When the next trail enters on the left, take the left to cross over<br/>
the culvert.  This trail is bearing 300 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the trail and head into the clearing, passing the trail <br/>
that<br/>
enters on the left as you enter the clearing.  The clearing has two<br/>
bird houses on poles around the edge.  <br/>
<br/>
Once in the clearing, take the blue blazed trail bearing North.<br/>
Continue on this trail for a short distance until the trail cuts<br/>
through a stone wall.<br/>
<br/>
Starting from the small (10" diameter) hemlock on the right-hand<br/>
(east) side of the trail on the south side of the wall, take 10 paces<br/>
east to a large maple tree in the wall.  Cross over to the north side<br/>
of the wall.  Take 3 paces east to a hemlock tree.  The box is in the<br/>
wall at its base.  Please stamp in, leave a restaurant recommendation,<br/>
and enjoy the recommendations left by others.  <br/>
<br/>
After stamping in you may want to enjoy the trails in the area or<br/>
return to your car by backtracking.<br/>
<br/>
Good eats!<br/>
