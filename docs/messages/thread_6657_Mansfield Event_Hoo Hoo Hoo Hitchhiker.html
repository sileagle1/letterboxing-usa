                    <html><body>We had a great time at the Mansfield Hollow State Park Letterboxing Event yesterday!  Too bad we got there so late, but the traffic and such you know.... :-)
<br/>Since we were last down the letterboxing trail, we found a hitchhiker at around letterbox #16, and decided to keep it and hide it somewhere other than box #17.  (those of you who were there, know that the hitchhiker traveled from box to box on  the trail) We will try and hide it tomorrow :-)  BTW... this was our first hitchhiker find!
<br/>
<br/>It was finally nice to meet many of the letterboxers that we have seen stamped into logbooks in our travels!  It was especially nice to meet Molly (of Chuck, Chickabirdie, and Molly) since we have seen a lot of their stamps as of late.  It was also nice to see Wanda and Pete again!  BTW...Thanks also to Chuck and Barb for telling us about those two quickie boxes out in Mansfield Center, and for Carolyn and her daughter for giving us a copy of the directions to the KJ's Best letterbox!  (A new logbook was placed in the KJ's box).  Special Thanks to Leader of the Pack (aka Carolyn) for another great letterboxing event!
