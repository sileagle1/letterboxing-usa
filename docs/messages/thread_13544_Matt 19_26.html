&gt;   As someone fairly familiar with  the bible (as an interesting piece <br/>
&gt; of literature)  I thought for sure Matt 19:26 referred to a biblical <br/>
&gt; chapter/verse. Detra, what does the coding mean, if you do not mind <br/>
&gt; me asking? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Matt 19:26 is my life verse.  It is from the Bible, and its how I sign my <br/>
name -- on just about everything.  It is that one verse that has special meaning <br/>
to me.  I had panic attacks that began in 1990 and I wasn't able to get out of <br/>
the house at all.  Not to go to the mailbox, no where! I prayed and medicated <br/>
and prayed and I was finally "well" enough to go out of the house some.  In <br/>
1994 I went to a church (my current church) where I heard the Pastor preaching <br/>
and using Matt 19:26 in his sermon.  "But Jesus beheld them, and said unto <br/>
them, with men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible."  My <br/>
Pastor actually used a reference to medicine here.  He said that the Drs can give <br/>
you medicine and you can still be sick, but that God can heal you completely. <br/>
 God made you and God can do the impossible.  So, I took this verse and <br/>
prayed over it and believed it. When I truly believed it, and in His time, God <br/>
healed me. This year I might have had one panic attack (from a bad experience).  I <br/>
am now married and have three small children and we go everywhere, often.  <br/>
LOL God was too good to me to not put that verse after my name.  This was <br/>
probably more than you asked for but thanks for reminding me how good God is!<br/>

of our local hospitals.  I have 2 kidney stones in the left kidney.  One is<br/>
4mm, the other is 7mm.  In case you don't know your metrics, as I didn't,<br/>
that's the size of a fairly large pea.  It isn't going ANYWHERE by itself.<br/>

In those 2 days, I was punctured, poked and prodded.  I feel like I was<br/>
mugged, or at the very least dropped off the table.  I am scheduled for<br/>
lithotripsy next Friday, from which it sounds like I'm going to feel pretty<br/>
much the same as I do right now, with the possible addition of more kidney<br/>
pain as the gravel passes - or tries to.<br/>

I am going to print your message below, and get out my Bible and pray over<br/>
the scripture as you said you did.  Our church is having a special healing<br/>
service tonight, and I'm going, believing God that when they x-ray to locate<br/>
those stones next Friday, they will not be able to find them.<br/>

was<br/>

for<br/>

pretty<br/>

&gt; &gt;   As someone fairly familiar with  the bible (as an interesting<br/>
piece <br/>
&gt; &gt; of literature)  I thought for sure Matt 19:26 referred to a<br/>
biblical <br/>
&gt; &gt; chapter/verse. Detra, what does the coding mean, if you do not<br/>
mind <br/>
&gt; &gt; me asking? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Matt 19:26 is my life verse.  It is from the Bible, and its how I<br/>
sign my <br/>
&gt; name -- on just about everything.  It is that one verse that has<br/>
special<br/>
&gt; meaning <br/>
&gt; to me.  I had panic attacks that began in 1990 and I wasn't able to<br/>
get out<br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; the house at all.  Not to go to the mailbox, no where! I prayed and<br/>
&gt; medicated <br/>
&gt; and prayed and I was finally "well" enough to go out of the house<br/>
some.  In <br/>
&gt; 1994 I went to a church (my current church) where I heard the Pastor<br/>
&gt; preaching <br/>
&gt; and using Matt 19:26 in his sermon.  "But Jesus beheld them, and<br/>
said unto <br/>
&gt; them, with men this is impossible; but with God all things are<br/>
possible."<br/>
&gt; My <br/>
&gt; Pastor actually used a reference to medicine here.  He said that the<br/>
Drs can<br/>
&gt; give <br/>
&gt; you medicine and you can still be sick, but that God can heal you<br/>
&gt; completely. <br/>
&gt; God made you and God can do the impossible.  So, I took this verse<br/>
and <br/>
&gt; prayed over it and believed it. When I truly believed it, and in His<br/>
time,<br/>
&gt; God <br/>
&gt; healed me. This year I might have had one panic attack (from a bad<br/>
&gt; experience).  I <br/>
&gt; am now married and have three small children and we go everywhere,<br/>
often.  <br/>
&gt; LOL God was too good to me to not put that verse after my name. <br/>
This was <br/>
&gt; probably more than you asked for but thanks for reminding me how<br/>
good God<br/>
&gt; is!<br/>
