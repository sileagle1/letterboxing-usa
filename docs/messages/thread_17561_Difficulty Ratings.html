                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for being understanding about this topic!  I see the consideration of your attempt to help folks, though I'm afraid there's a subjective problem involved:  Differing terrain.  What is a '5' on a scale of 1-10 for difficult terrain?  A wet, slippery, teetering rocky shoreline is no problem for some locals, and a 100-foot rockface is just part and parcel of some areas' hikes.  Okay, so what's hard for a coastie may be just a '7', while the other is a '10', but then vice versa for a Rocky Mountain dude.<br/>
Often, verbage is a better descriptor, though it must guard against subjectivity and vagueness.  Examples:  Handicapped-accessible.  Requires big steps for little legs, and a 6-foot drop at one point.  20-foot rocky hill at about a 45-degree angle.  And definitely the length of the walk in miles or feet or leagues or whatever is good for guaging the amount of daylight you've got left.<br/>
Hopefully, especially with the quality of the clues, we all talk to the planter before we post anything non-complementary.  Please tell me if there's any trouble with a "The von der Insels" box!  I want everyone to enjoy my boxes without frustration!<br/>

My mom, who got me into letterboxing previously injured herself and <br/>
now it is difficult for her to walk over uneven ground or to walk <br/>
for long distances any more. The injury has become degenerative and <br/>
will only get worse. So like we've pretty much stuck to areas that <br/>
we're familiar with so far. That way we already kind of know what to <br/>
expect in the way of difficulty of the location.<br/>
<br/>
Since we always print out clues before we go, we have time in the <br/>
car to review them and kind of determine who difficult they are.<br/>
<br/>
When we exhaust the local boxes or take any trips what we talked <br/>
about doing is making an accomodation to her injury by being ADVANCE <br/>
PLANNER type of letter boxers which means looking online for the <br/>
clues and then emailing the creator of the boxes we're going to look <br/>
for to explain the circumstances and limitations and ask for <br/>
additional input from them that they may not have wanted to be a <br/>
part of the clues since it would really only apply to a limited <br/>
number of people. Did any of that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Mystery is great and I understand what you are saying about it. I <br/>
also understand that not every box we go looking for will be found. <br/>
But for me the best part of the experience is enjoying being with my <br/>
mom. And like everyone else in the world, she's a lot more fun to be <br/>
around when she's not in pain! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I guess it's just the way she raised me, but I guess if you don't <br/>
think the clues give enough information, then why not take some <br/>
personal responsibilty and inicetive and email the creator? Not that <br/>
they're obligated to reply or provide additional information. Maybe <br/>
that's where the replacement mystery and challenge comes from.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what would be helpful to me personally, I think I agree <br/>
with the person who said use descriptive words instead of <br/>
numbers. "Soggy, uneven ground" is less open to interupertation than <br/>
say using the term "5 out of 10" would be. But that's just my <br/>
opinion. <br/>
