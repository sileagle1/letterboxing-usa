                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, Gang!!<br/>
I'm starting to put a few new ideas together, and wanted to share them with<br/>
you all and see what we can do with them...<br/>
<br/>
As you know, I've been helping Dan work on the web pages, most notably the<br/>
Kids Corner section.  One of the things I've been intending to include is sort<br/>
of a "kid's eye view" of how to use a compass.  Something that goes a little<br/>
more in-depth than the simple North-South-East-West approach that the Map<br/>
Reading Game utilizes, but not as complex and technical as most of the How-to-<br/>
use-a-Compass websites I've seen on the Net.  Rather than have Dan or I put<br/>
this together, I thought it might be a good chance to pull some other group<br/>
members into the project.  I love the ''group effort'' approach we have<br/>
established thus far, and would like to expand on it.<br/>
<br/>
So if any of you have ideas for the text and/or artwork for this project, or<br/>
are interested in helping put it together, please speak up.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought I had recently was inspired by the way Dan has been passing<br/>
his GPS unit around the country... As you know, the folks in Dartmoor have<br/>
annual get-togethers where they all compare their collections of stamp<br/>
impressions.  People who have collected a certain number of stamps (200, 500,<br/>
1000, etc.) earn the right to collect an imprint from a special stamp as a<br/>
reward for the efforts.  Of course, since we are applying the hobby to our<br/>
entire nation, this method is not really practical here in the States.<br/>
<br/>
It occured to me that we could commision some special stamps of this sort from<br/>
various members of the group, and pass them around via snail-mail to those who<br/>
have qualified.  Of course, at this stage in the game, we could lower our<br/>
standards a bit.  Maybe awarding stamps for 20 or 50 or something like that.<br/>
Also I would not be objected to allowing inclusion of one's own letterbox<br/>
stamps.  At this point in time, it is just as important that we place boxes as<br/>
find them, so this effort should be equally rewarded.  We could request that<br/>
people who qualify send copies of their stamp impressions, along with info<br/>
about the place and time of the find.  Then we can add their names to the list<br/>
of recipients for the travelling stamps.  When the list hits a dry spell, the<br/>
last person will then send the stamp back to Dan or myself.<br/>
<br/>
Any comments?<br/>

            Just to clarify this meet thing. There is a special one day only<br/>
stamp for all. And you get a cloth  badge to sew on your bag or jacket  for<br/>
collecting 100,200,500,1000,2000,3000,4000 &amp; 5000 stamps not a special<br/>
stamp.<br/>

<br/>
I am officially volunteering... let me know when the 1st brainstorming<br/>
session begins... maybe a scheduled ICQ chat? <br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  It occured to me that we could commision some special stamps of this sort from<br/>
&gt;  various members of the group, and pass them around via snail-mail to those who<br/>

&gt;  last person will then send the stamp back to Dan or myself.<br/>
<br/>
Actually... I started carving a travelling stamp awhile ago with<br/>
thoughts of circulating it around the group just because.  We don't get<br/>
to mingle much &amp; I thought it might be a cool way to collect a stamp or<br/>
two in the accomanying log book.  I put it on hold because I wasn't sure<br/>
I wanted to send it along &amp; then expect the rest of you to pay postage<br/>
for its continued circulation.<br/>
