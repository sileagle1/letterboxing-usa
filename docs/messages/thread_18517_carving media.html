                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the size suggestions.  In art school we used to carve pieces of gray linoleum with speedball tools for making prints of all sizes, so I'm having a hard time picturing this stuff as "pink stuff", not having actually seen any yet!  I think I still have some linoleum carving material around.  Has anyone used that for stamps? As I remember, it had a burlap backing. Maybe my Michael's does have the pink stuff &amp; tools... I asked, but who knows if they really know what all is on their shelves.  I'll look again in other spots people suggested.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>
