I'm so sorry to hear about "Lady of the Lake" being purloined.  I had <br/>
printed out the wonderful directions and was hoping to get down there <br/>
real soon. . . .  I'm sure it's very disheartening when you put so <br/>
much of yourself into something to have it be whisked away like <br/>
that.  May the culprit have an attack of conscience and return the <br/>
original to it's rightful home. . . . .<br/>

Maybe the nicer they are - the quicker they disappear.  Don't put your<br/>
heart and soul into them - people will only steal them more often and more<br/>
quickly. I know it is a damn shame - I feel soooooo bad!<br/>

Yes, we were especially sad about that Lady of the Lake not appearing <br/>
for us, as we had been hoping that she would be our F1000, after a <br/>
long hot steamy day of letterboxing on Wednesday, when temps hit the <br/>
90's!  Instead, after a quick jump in the lake and another hot climb <br/>
up the Pine Loop trail to my "old friend" the AT - and ,yes, Nancy, <br/>
wondrously accompanied by Oma's turkey vultures! - The Claddagh <br/>
became our 1000th found letterbox!(with a special friendship coin to <br/>
comemorate the occasion as well!) Thanks so much to all the wonderful <br/>
letterbox planters who have brought us such joy!<br/>

PS Alan, we're right in the middle of doing your Norwalk area boxes <br/>
at this very moment, and just stopped into the Norwalk library to <br/>
check on messages before we head down to PA!!!<br/>
