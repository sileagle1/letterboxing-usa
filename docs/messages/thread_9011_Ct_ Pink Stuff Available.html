                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all in Ct.  The Lily Pad North Street , Willimantic,  just called <br/>
me. I put in a request that they restock the pink stuff. Well they <br/>
got it in two days   AND  its on sale at 30 percent off. Come on <br/>
down.  Get carving and lets add to the great boxes out there. <br/>
   Thanks to B-weekend warrior and Fireman 2B&amp; Irish Mum for the new <br/>
boxes. Today Mansfield was in a teacher in servce day - No School , <br/>
the sun was warm, leaves crunch under the fall of each step, brooks <br/>
babbled and there were  2 new boxes in town. Both Pink Trotters and <br/>
the Cowboy were out with me  Hey it doesn't get any better! Enjoy the <br/>
weekend.   Leader of the Pack<br/>

If you go without your 'regular' boxing buddy of 2 legs you just have to backtrack to all the boxes you did without them anyway.  <br/>
