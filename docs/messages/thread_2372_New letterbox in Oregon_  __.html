***** Los Osos Oaks Letterbox Series Update *****<br/>
I noticed the letterbox series was posted to the website, but two <br/>
things:<br/>
<br/>
1. There's four letterboxes in the series, not one.  (It really is a <br/>
series!)<br/>
<br/>
2. If "San Luis Obispo" is too long for the name of the county, I'd <br/>
suggest "San Luis" instead.  That's what it's called locally.  Or <br/>
even "SLO" will work.  Nobody ever calls it S.L. Obispo.  Actually, <br/>
nobody ever calls it San Luis Obispo, either, even if that is the <br/>
full, proper name of the county (and city).  Well, out of towners do, <br/>
but locals always call it either "San Luis" or "SLO" (pronounced just <br/>
like SLOW).<br/>
<br/>
That's about it for me.  Enjoy!<br/>

I'm very excited to see that you kept your promise to plant a box in <br/>
the Oregon!  With the addition of your Saddle Mountain box, the North <br/>
Oregon Coast is really beginning to look like a good spot for a <br/>
letterboxing weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks for the corrections regarding the Los Osos Oaks Series. <br/>
I've updated the California pages accordingly.<br/>
