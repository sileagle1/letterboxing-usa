Thanks Daniel for sending the container. I'm going to carve and stamp, and see if I can fit all the necessary goodies into the jar. It seems a bit small, but perhaps I need to think smaller!<br/>
<br/>
I received a waterproof pad from Write in the Rain. When I stamped on the paper, the ink seemed to not want to dry and got really smudgy. Has anyone else had this problem? Maybe its the type of inkpad I'm using. <br/>
I also found a 2 for 1 Rubbermaid sale this weekend and so I stocked up on a few containers. You all might keep your eyes open for such a sale in your area.<br/>
<br/>
Daniel, if the jar works out, would you be interested in selling a few to me?<br/>
<br/>

	I noticed that water based inks (including those in stamp pads) do<br/>
not give very satisfacatory results with the rite in the rain paper.  This<br/>
is probably due to the water resistant nature of the paper.  This may be a<br/>
bit of a problem because you can't be sure what kind of inkpad each<br/>
intrepid explorer is going to bring along.  For now I am planning on using<br/>
a plain paper pad in a ziploc bag in my soon to be boxes.<br/>

&gt;  It appears to be just like regular paper. My vote is that it is<br/>
&gt;  coated.  Since the coating is designed to repel water, water based<br/>
&gt;  ink will not adhere.  That, after all, is its job!!<br/>

Yes, I believe that's what the blurb said.  It did not occur to me<br/>
at the time that some (most?) inks are water-based.  Back to the<br/>
drawing board.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I'm glad I said near perfect and not perfect when I recommended them.  I have not had the ink globing problem.  I stamp my write in the rain field book with the stamp from each box I plant.  The stamps look as good in my field book which gets close and put into my pack pretty quickly.  I am using archival inkpads. The only stampers whose stamps don't look too hot in the box pad are the ones who stamped them on a really drizzly day with a water based ink. Their stamp tinted the book with the image, but did not impress the image clearly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Write in the Rain does make a plastic paper.  I think the books you have are just coated paper.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the durability of write-in-the-rain.  I had a boat motor fail while on vacation.  My field book was in my pocket when I dove overboard to swim to a little island where some folks were playing and might have been willing to give us a ride in.  The book was fine after the swim.  Later the same book was in my pocket when it went through the washer and dryer.  The only negative result was a badly worn cover from the abrasion of sloshing around in the pocket and some ink bleed across from one page to the other of a black pen I had used (causing the ink to turn blue interestingly).  Though the pages are not wrinkled, hot water and long submersion might be a problem.  I wouldn't put it in a thermal pool, or any pool, purposely.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem I have is finding a hard flat surface, which doesn't flex, to get a good stamp image.  The little tupperware containers bend just enough to sometime let the impression fade in the middle.  Could just be technique.<br/>
<br/>
The Write in the rain stuff works for me, but its certainly a personal choice re: what works for individuals.<br/>
