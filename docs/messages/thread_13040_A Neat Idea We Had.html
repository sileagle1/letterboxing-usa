<br/>
In planting the Middle Earth series (not completed, by any means), we <br/>
came upon a very wonderful shop. We got the owner to agree to have a <br/>
box and only give it out with the right password. We hope it is good <br/>
for his business.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many other folks are doing this kind of thing? <br/>
<br/>
Here is the link to the box <br/>

BTW, fake rocks are doing well. I am also hollowing out traverntine <br/>
(sp?) rocks, too. Of course I am wearing a dust mask.<br/>
<br/>
I also seem to be the first of our group (Googled) to come down with <br/>
a small attack of poison oak. *sigh* I think it was at the Salmon <br/>
Creek Falls box near Gorda, CA.<br/>

Hello Sir B--<br/>
There are at least 3 establishments in the PNW where you either ask the <br/>
person behind the counter for the box, or you find it yourself but the owner is <br/>
aware of its placement.  (It's a fun twist!)<br/>

I planted a box on private property on a farm with a really neat <br/>
country barn gift shop (Peace on Earth).  At first, the owner and I <br/>
were going to do the password thing, but that was limiting because <br/>
sometimes he was out in the fields and keeping his staff up to date <br/>
would be too much.  Also, the farm closes for the winter which would <br/>
restrict access.  We ended up placing it on the grounds of the farm <br/>
and let the caretaker know the location of the box so when folks went <br/>
into the property off season, he'd know why.<br/>
<br/>
According to the log book, folks enjoy finding the box during the <br/>
winter (it is safe from the elements and is a hitchhiker magnet) and <br/>
often return during the regular season to shop and enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
It's a mutually beneficial proposition for both you and the shop <br/>
owner.  Best of luck to you!<br/>
