Hello!  The Basses had a very productive boxing day today!  We found <br/>
the Box On and Zodiac series in Black Hill park.  Except we <br/>
accidently skipped over the directions for Deanno's Capricorn, so <br/>
we'll have to go back sometime.  Still have to get the Birder Series <br/>
anyway.  We also found the Blair Letterboxing Project box.  We got 8 <br/>
stamps in all.  While hiking back to the car, from finishing the <br/>
Zodiac series, a huge owl swooped out in front of us, landing in a <br/>
tree.  You just never get to see (at least I don't!) owls out there, <br/>
so it was incredible to watch this thing in action!  He kept flying <br/>
fron tree to tree so close to us.  It was amazing that he never made <br/>
the smallest sound.  They are so silent.  It wasn't a horned owl, we <br/>
could see there were no "horns," but he was huge.  His wing span had <br/>
to be at least 4 feet.  It was very cool!<br/>
Keep an eye out for a new MD mystery box, coming soon.  I am also <br/>
working on an idea for an Artemis Fowl series.  Can't wait to get <br/>
started on it.  (hands rubbing together, maniacal smile...)<br/>
