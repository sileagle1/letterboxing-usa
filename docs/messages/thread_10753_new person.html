My husband and I found the letterboxing.org website this past summer and were instantly intrigued. So we put together a book, stamp and pad and set off to find our first box. This fall we found five boxes, one of which was a hitchhiker and the other a cryptic box! This is great! We've had such fun and it's something we can do together. Now we're trying to decide where to hide a box in our area this spring. Tom is working on a stamp design. I've read all the faqs but anyone else who has tips to share, we would welcome them. Thanks!<br/>

Hi Lynne ! We are also from MA and I wanted to welcome you.<br/>
As for stamp carving and box placing advise I think Ryan's Web page<br/>
is a good place to start. Have Fun !!<br/>

Oh, I just *have* to ask - since I have planted several boxes in MA.  <br/>
Which ones did you find?<br/>
