                    <div class="plaintext-content">Jeepers - I just looked at my calender - we will only be with you all for<br/>
another two-and-a-bit weeks! Eeek! I've been meaning to put together a<br/>
traveller for sometime now, and it looks like now is now the hour. So (...drum<br/>
roll...) the Homesick Psychokiwi Traveller will be available at the<br/>
Molly/Ginger and Mystery Gatherings (assuming I get my act and head together -<br/>
which at the moment is a big ask).<br/>
<br/>
We have been blessed in the last four years with so many new friends who have<br/>
welcomed us into their homes and hearts - although we will always be homesick<br/>
for New Zealand when we're away, we will now always be homesick for America<br/>
too. We will miss you all very much!<br/>
<br/>
So please wish us "Bon Voyage" (in the language of your choice) then look at<br/>
us expectantly. If (a) I've understood what you've said, and (b) I've<br/>
remembered to bring it along, you will (c) be amply rewarded :-)<br/>
<br/>
See you Soon,<br/>
<br/>
