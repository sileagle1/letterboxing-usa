Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I am very new and have been lurking off and on, mostly off for a while now. I live in NYC and don't have a car, so the fact that this is primarily a rural hobby has made it a little hard for me to get into to it, or easy to not try a little harder. <s> I'm sorry if I offended anyone by not introducing myself. I didn't mean to not do it. I just lurked a few times and then posted. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the mini ruckus???.... I caused about the virus post on that other site. I was only going by what Earthlink sent me. Since the "virus" was supposed to have been intercepted, I doubt if it would make any difference if I know what a virus is or not, which I do. <br/>
<br/>
I am sending my first carved stamps and box off to the Monster Mash on Monday.....last minute of course and had a great time. I have placed a couple in my home state of Texas while on a trip back home. I want to place some here in the city but it is just so hard to come up with safe places. Or at least it seems that way to me. Central Park seems so obvious, you know? But I need to get off my rear and get on the letterboxing ball. <br/>
<br/>
It also seems like such a family oriented thing. Kids, camping, ticks, <eg> Can I single, divorced, middle-aged woman find happiness in letterboxing she wonders? <br/>
<br/>
Soooooooooo...anyhoo............hello.....officially....so there <br/>

together, i often go alone. just be careful where you are going. you could<br/>
also see if there is any letterboxers in the new york city area that would<br/>
love to have company. must be one or two out there somewhere as i have<br/>
noticed there is plantings in manhattan, the bronx, and new york city.  good<br/>

hope for those of us trapped in the city. I'll be "retiring" (hate <br/>

forward to being able to really jump into deeper rural letterboxing <br/>
