(CT) and I also searched unsuccessfully for the Tower<br/>
Box. Thanks for letting us know that it's missing -<br/>
one always wonders what the story is when you search<br/>
but can't find it.  I did find 3 other boxes that day<br/>
(the Chin, the Chest, and the Right Hip).  On the<br/>
whole, I had a wonderful day, and I hope to go back<br/>
there soon to hunt for more boxes.  Sleeping Giant is<br/>
a great place!<br/>

&gt;     Question: I took a group hiking at sleeping<br/>
&gt; giant state park where we looked <br/>
&gt;     for the box up at the tower but had no luck. We<br/>
&gt; did not have a compass -- is <br/>
&gt;     that really necessary to find the box? please<br/>
&gt; email me if you have found the <br/>
&gt;     box before with or without a compass. <br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     The tower box at Sleeping Giant has been missing<br/>
&gt; for over a year now.  Sorry, Melissa<br/>
