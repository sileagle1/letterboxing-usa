                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I read from NewBe that only one person has submitted an entry to <br/>
be considered as the official stamp of the East Coast gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
Consider this my official plea to all East Coasters:<br/>
<br/>
CARVE A STAMP!  <br/>
Sarah, of the ADG, has submitted two stamps but as of yet, these are <br/>
the only entries.  Please take some time out of your day and <br/>
challenge my talented friend.  <br/>
<br/>
As much as I adore both of the stamps she carved, we do not want <br/>
victory by default. <br/>
<br/>
CARPE DIEM ET CARVUS! (sieze the day and carve!)<br/>

It sounds to be as if you already have TWO official stamps for this<br/>
gathering.<br/>

Inclusiveness, artistic growth, respect....<br/>

Sorry, I think you miss-read our plea.  We are trying to encorage <br/>
creativity and to get others involved in the proccess.  You are <br/>
absolutly right, it is not about the judging, that was never our <br/>
point.  It was to encorage the journey.<br/>
