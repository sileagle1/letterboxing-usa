We really liked Jay Drew's idea of planting boxes to go along with the various <br/>
whale sculptures temporarily being displayed along the coast from Old Lyme, <br/>
CT to Boston, MA.  So, we have picked out a whale to plant a box near too!  <br/>
Jay choose "Health and Whaleness" at Flanders Fish Market in CT (great fish <br/>
and chips) for his original whale box (named Free Welly), and now we've <br/>
decided to take "Get Whale Soon" in Westerly, RI.  Hope some of those other <br/>
whales get "adopted" by boxers in the area, and then we could have quite a <br/>
whale fest here in southern New England.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Jay, for sharing this whale of a project  :-)<br/>
