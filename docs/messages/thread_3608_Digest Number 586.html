&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;   About a month ago I emailed you with the suggestion that<br/>
&gt;&gt;   Family of Friends may be missing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;   No reply since.<br/>
&gt;&gt;   Has anyone been able to check it out.<br/>
&gt;&gt;   Also beware of hunters<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Fred,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I went hunting for Family of Friends on Oct. 7, following<br/>
&gt; our RI gathering, and found them both.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for not responding...  I did get your email (Fred, not<br/>
Tom), and asked Chris to verify the continued existance of<br/>
the first box (he lives about five minutes from it), and he<br/>
never got back to me.  So, this time at least someone *other*<br/>
than the RIBNAG webmaster has exhibited excessive laziness ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It does make me happy to hear that it hasn't died, though...<br/>
I know the DEM(?) uses portions of that land actively (they<br/>
grow corn to feed deer and other critters, if I recall<br/>
correctly), but if they found it, i would expect the second<br/>
box to dissapear rather the first...<br/>
<br/>
Again, my apologies.  In the future, I will make a point of<br/>
responding to emails even if just to say "we will look into<br/>
it".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
