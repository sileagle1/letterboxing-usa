We enjoyed the Kurdziel's "Metamorphosis" series at the Hoffman <br/>
Evergreen Preserve in Stonington (New London county) so much we <br/>
thought we would plagiarize...no...add-on. So here are three more <br/>
letterboxes in the terrific little Hoffman Evergreen Preserve: they <br/>
will add  mile to Metamorphosis and your day on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Find the first Metamorphosis box, "Egg." Then follow the directions <br/>
to the Bennett Cemetery intersection. Turn left on this spur trail <br/>
and walk a short way to the beautifully kept, historic place. Looking <br/>
in the northeast corner of the surrounding stone wall, find the <br/>
Avalonia Trust Letterbox tucked between flat slabs.<br/>
<br/>
Walk back to the trail you left behind and continue on, finding the <br/>
next two Metamorphosis letterboxes (Larva and Chrysalis). Back at <br/>
intersection #3, either continue northeast on the Colonial Highway or <br/>
take the Blue Loop (marked "West" on a tree-sign) for a peek at <br/>
Whitford Brook and a Pine Loop Trail. Both choices will bring you to <br/>
intersection #4. Follow the red trail east. Pass from one pine grove <br/>
into another through a beautiful stone gate. Turn right and bushwhack <br/>
about 50 yards along the wall on your right to another well made, <br/>
forgotten pass-through. Do. On the right in the southeast corner, <br/>
find the Pine Grove Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Go back through this little gate and bushwhack right a short way <br/>
further along the wall to pick up the red trail again. Turn right and <br/>
walk down to intersection #3. Here you can head back to the <br/>
beginning: follow the red trail left, south-southeast, for a short <br/>
climb. The trail then makes a straight  mile shot south-southeast <br/>
paralleling a stone wall on your left. When the trail (and the wall) <br/>
zig zags right-to-left, you'll find an intersection with the yellow <br/>
trail. Look down low around the corner in the wall facing the yellow <br/>
trail for the Hemlock Grove Letterbox. Staying with the red and <br/>
bypassing the yellow and blue trails, you'll soon find your car.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the Kurdziel Family for this terrific hike.<br/>
