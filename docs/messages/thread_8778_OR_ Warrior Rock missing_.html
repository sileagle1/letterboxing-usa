They tried to get hold of Der Mad Stamper to see if it had been confirmed alive and well, or missing in action. She never heard anything, so we headed back out there today and still found nothing. I was just wondering if anyone could confirm that it really does exist!</div> <div> </div> <div>Thanks,</div> <div>Jill aka Lillbit</div> <div> </div> <div>PS</div> <div>The day wasn't a total waste.

It did last year.  Around May or so.  That's the last time I know of it <br/>
being sighted, though.  It was hidden in an area that's prone to <br/>
flooding, though, so it might have washed away.  I sincerely <br/>
doubt anybody actually found it by accident and swiped it--it was <br/>
too well hidden.  But a flood could have gotten it loss easy.<br/>
