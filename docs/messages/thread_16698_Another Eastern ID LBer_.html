                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was just thrilled yesterday when I went to check on one of my <br/>
boxes only to see that there was a group of stamps in it and it <br/>
appeared they were labelled as being from Idaho Falls.  Then <br/>
today I realized that there was a new letterbox out here too.  I am <br/>
really excited.  I am wondering if there are finally some <br/>
letterboxers out here besided myself (and the two friends who go <br/>
under some duress with me sometimes).  <br/>
<br/>
If there is someone else out there, who also reads the list, that <br/>
is,  let me know.  That will be so great!<br/>
