Over the long weekend I had the opportunity to visit the Auburn California letterbox. I was the 3rd visitor to the box. This is my first box I've found -- I've placed 9, lost 7, found 1. Finally finding a box and placing my stamp was quite a thrill! <br/>
I love the urban box. It provides a wonderful "quick" visit to a place--and especially appropriate for the town of Auburn, which sits on Interstate 80 and happens to be "on the way" to a lot of places, but rarely a destination. Thanks Matthew!<br/>
<br/>
I had the opportunity to place a second letterbox in the Donner Summit area. This one is not so urban, and, admittedly, difficult to get to. But it's well worth the efforts (if I do say so myself!). Matthew, are you up for the challenge?<br/>

LOLA'S LOOK OUT BOX<br/>
<br/>
This box is in the Royal Gorge Cross Country Ski area. You will need a trail map (www.royalgorge -- check out Ice Lakes region on the trail map) to find LOLA'S LOOK OUT. Once you've hiked up to the lookout, you will find a "Danger of Avalanches" sign. From the sign, walk 45 paces at 170 degrees south. There you will find the box.<br/>
<br/>
This hike is about 7.5 miles, with an altitude gain of about 1,000. You will need approximately 3-4 hours to make the loop. Once you're up there, you should walk the ridge, take advantage of the beautiful scenery and hide a box!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, this box is a 3 season box. Do not attempt it in the Winter as it will be dangerous (avalanches &amp; quick moving storms) and you will be kicked off by the Royal Gorge ski patrol. And the box will be hidden under 6 feet of snow!<br/>
<br/>
When hiking, watch out for brown bears and ticks (Lyme's disease). Make sure you take a trail map, and do not go over the mountain to the south side. This is wilderness area with no facilities.<br/>
<br/>
Sidenote: Lola Montez was a dancer who spent time in the Sierra. When not dnacing and entertaining men, she began to devote much of her time to child care and showed great compassion for troubled women, Leading a very colorful life, there are quite a few areas bearing her name. Lola's Lookout is one of them. (www.users.cloud9.net/~critique/why-not/Lola.htm)<br/>
