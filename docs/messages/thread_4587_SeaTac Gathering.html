<br/>
Anymore details on the Seattle or Tacoma gathering taking place next<br/>
weekend???  We're game for the deal.  We'll be staying in Seattle, I'm<br/>
quite certain, but if the gathering is in Tacoma we can head down there,<br/>
as well from where we're staying.  Maybe we should have something Friday<br/>
night in Tacoma and something Saturday night in Seattle.  Or am I just<br/>
getting too complicated and trying to please too many people?  <br/>
<br/>
Whatever the case, someone else has to take the ball and run with it on<br/>
this one.  I'm O.K. at Portland gatherings, but my geographical and<br/>
local restaurant knowledge of the Seattle/Tacoma area is sadly lacking.<br/>
Just tell me when and where and we will gladly be there.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, since I live in West Seattle, I vote for The Alki Bakery on <br/>
Alki Beach....But maybe something down in Southcenter near SeaTac <br/>
would be more centrally located.  There is an Azteca Restaurant or a <br/>
Red Robin or a Cucina Cucina (Italian) down there.  Any would be <br/>
great.  I think Ryan C. is actually doing the planning.<br/>
