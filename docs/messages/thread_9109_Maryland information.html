Thanks for replacing things at Hal and the Magic Mushroom. It is one of my early boxes and favoriate. I think I hid it in 2000. Also thanks for fixing up the Yankauer box which is also an early box. In 2000 I had only found 3 boxes and didn't have a clue what they should look like. I used those cheap zip lock boxes and now after 2 years have found out that they hold water really well but they can't keep it out.  I am using more expensive boxes now but replacements are hard. Thanks for the help. <br/>

I totally enjoyed meeting everyone at Fireflylight 100th box event. I am still overwhelmed at all the interest in this hobby and enthusiams. Fireflylight has hid a lot of boxes as well and for that I am grateful. We went off to find some of hers and had a great time. I snuck in a surprise while the ADG weren't looking. What goes around, comes around. ;).<br/>

May you all be nuts in someones life,<br/>
