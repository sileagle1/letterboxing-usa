                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out and did the Sunday Drive series today.  All the boxes <br/>
were found and in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
There is a road closed on the route.  It is from mileage 13.5 to <br/>
14.7 in the clues.  I was able to take a detour around the area and <br/>
come back in to get the third box.  The signs say that the road will <br/>
be closed at various times for reconstruction during this fall.  It <br/>
looks like there will be times that access to the parking lot at <br/>
mileage 13.8 will be closed.<br/>
<br/>
There was a couple and their dog having lunch at the picnic table <br/>
just 50 feet from the box.  I sat down over the box to pick it up, <br/>
stamped it in the car, and sat down over the spot to rehide it.  I <br/>
don't think they were suspicious.  This is a nefarious hobby at <br/>
times.<br/>
