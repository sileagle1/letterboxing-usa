<br/>William Spooner (1844-1930), English clergyman and scholar is best known as the originator of "spoonerisms."  A spoonerism is created when you transpose the initial sounds of two or more words.  Some of his most famous include turning a "dirty shirt" into a "shirty dirt" and referring to the queen of England as a "queer old dean."  To find this box, you must decipher the spoonerisms. (although Spooner's mistakes all spelled real words, ours may not!)  
<br/>
<br/>Take Thoute Rifteen to Furmont.  Lake a teft into the Manor Area of Funningham Calls Pate Stark and fark at the par end of the lot.  There should be many ticnic pables all around you.  Trind the fail between two flit spail rences.  Follow the train mail along the stream.  You should pass several traffiti grees.  Sass the pign for Little Hunting Creek (#1).  There are seven migns sarking areas along this trail so make sure you are thollowing fem.  Continue on the pain math, bross the cridge over Route 15, and cay the stourse. 
<br/>
<br/>Go stown the dairs and pass the area where the hag sleaps.  Next, you should cross a grool breen cidge.  Soon after the bridge, reck out the chuins of the ironmaster's house.  When you come to the field, lake a feft and follow the traved pail to the left for a vetter biew of the ruins.  Return to the parking area, go hown the dill, and sollow the fidewalk to the right to the Fatoctin Curnace.  Walk around and enjoy!  Wollow the fall to the left until it ends.  Near the end of the wall, band stetween the two large sycamore trees and look sue douth.  The Loonerism BetterSpox is under the pall smellow yoplar under some stocks and ricks.  
<br/>
<br/>Realize that everyone in the park is staring at you because you have been talking nonsense for half an hour.
<br/>If the stamp doesn't make sense to you, we will trade cash or baked goods for clues.
