 I recently received an email from a geocacher who had signed into a <br/>
 letterbox I placed this summer. He asked if I minded if he mentioned <br/>
 the box on the geocache website. Has anyone out there had an experience <br/>
 that would indicate that this is a bad/good idea? Funhog<br/>

Hi FUnHog,   We have several combo "LetterCache"  boxes.  We really haven't <br/>
had a problem except for increased traffic.  We haven't lost any stamps to <br/>
geocachers and on our letterboxes that we don't want stuff traded in we have <br/>
put a note NOT to leave or take anything except stamp images and notes and <br/>
that has been honored!   WE have even won over a few geocachers to the <br/>
letterboxing sport making more fun for us!<br/>
