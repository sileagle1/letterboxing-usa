<br/>
It's nice of you to stop by our e-group!  Letterboxing has taken off<br/>
here, as well, especially on the East Coast of the USA.  The rest of us<br/>
are doing our best to catch up with the pros in Dartmoor and here in the<br/>
New England region of the United States of America. I live on the West<br/>
Coast in a marvelous place called Portland, Oregon.  Keep tuned in, and<br/>
feel free to come to America.  We're not quite as sophisticated as<br/>
Dartmoor, perhaps, but I'll bet we have just as much fun hunting for and<br/>
hiding letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

   We are sorry to hear that Dartmoor is closed. I'd like to extend a <br/>
similar invitation to you to come boxing in the US. The state of <br/>
Conneiticut is a bit larger than Dartmoor (not by much) and has quite a <br/>
few letterboxes.<br/>
