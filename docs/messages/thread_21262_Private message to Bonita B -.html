My oh my, I do love hearing about Lady P's life adventures. Mexico no <br/>
less!! Poison Ivy, your comments, though so poetic in nature do <br/>
border on the impropiety... take care my dear.<br/>

I have never laid claim to the adjective 'proper' when referring to <br/>
myself. Truly, oft times I take pride in the barbaric and bohemian, <br/>
and mine own lowly pedigree. Golly what freedom.<br/>
<br/>
It's Lady Prisspott we have to guard carefully, lest she fall into a <br/>
snare of her own perfection.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think the punctilious <br/>
(look it up -- it's on my word-a-day toilet paper) <br/>
would just have to stand stock still for fear of crossing the line <br/>
of propriety with the slightest of slip of a word, gesture, glance <br/>
or arched eyebrow. <br/>
<br/>
But then, frozen, how could they send thank you cards in response to <br/>
the polite inquiries regarding their health?<br/>

Pish-tosh my dearest pompously prolix Poison Ivy. Were you<br/>
consanguinous with someone of her Ladyship's high breeding you would<br/>
realize that propriety is innate. One can effortlessly conduct<br/>
themselves through a gracious life fearless of the foibles of those<br/>
for whom etiquette and propriety are a life's study. And, should one<br/>
falter there are certain elements of society who can "erase" all trace<br/>
of indiscretion. You may possibly be aware that many blue-bloods can<br/>
trace lineage to the Medici who originated the concept of the "amici<br/>
di amici" or friends of friends. Quin etiam, I had a lovely<br/>
conversation with dear cousin Guido about you just today.<br/>
<br/>
Do take care dear Ivy,<br/>
