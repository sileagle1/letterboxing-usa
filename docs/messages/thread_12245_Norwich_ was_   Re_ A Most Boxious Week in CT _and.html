shady characters in that area wind up in an ambulance with Patrick <br/>
and I and usually have a bottle of midnight train or thunderbird!  <br/>
Probably one of the biggest towns for "shady characters" i've seen!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Indeed a nice park and I feel bad that we've not gotten up there to <br/>
get Code 1 yet. <br/>

<br/>
&gt; Code 1 box on the way home.  Great pond and spot!  A shady <br/>
character came out <br/>
&gt; of the woods with a twelve pack of coke and other stuff, but who <br/>
knows?  <br/>
&gt; Perhaps there's a convenience store on the other side of the <br/>
woods?????  <br/>
