Somewhere on Lower Higuera, a "totem pole" guards the entrance to a <br/>
trailer park. O.k., so this particular post is meant to reference <br/>
the more local native people that give the park its name, and I mean <br/>
no disrespect to anyone in or out of this mobile home village, but <br/>
I'm stretching the point to include it in my Alaskan series. <br/>
On the island of the pole, pass the furthest palm tree, and check the <br/>
nearest cluster of rocks. The rock with the almost crescent-like <br/>
shape hides box # 1.<br/>
<br/>
Within a mile from box # 1, on a street more high than lower Higuera, <br/>
constantly restored advertising mural first painted in the 1950's <br/>
decorates the side of a deli named for the street it is on. This <br/>
deli, by the way, has one of the best selections of gourmet soda pops <br/>
in the area. From the mural, head one full block at 315 degrees to a <br/>
corner. From that corner, about a half block at 210 degrees will <br/>
take you very near to box # 2. It is under a rock very near a <br/>
prominent plumbing fixture. <br/>
