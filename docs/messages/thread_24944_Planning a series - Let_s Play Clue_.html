  It's a great idea. A group of boxers did a similar thing in Richmond, <br/>
VA back in...2003?... I think. The planter solicited stamps form boxers <br/>
around the country. They were planted in groups - the weapons in one <br/>
area park, the suspects in another and the rooms in yet another. You <br/>
have to find all of the final boxes which contain the clues, and once <br/>
you put them together you can seek the solution in yet another park. I <br/>
think someone has done something similar in NC. It's a fun hunt!<br/>

<br/>
As others had said, it is a cool idea, go for it.<br/>
<br/>
I don't understand why some think that a box has to represent its <br/>
location.  It doesn't.  Sure, there are great boxes out that that blend <br/>
the history of the location with the clue and stamp, but I have also <br/>
found some awsome boxes that have nothing to do with the location. <br/>
<br/>
Do your boxes do any harm to others?  No.  Then why worry about getting <br/>
approval from the peanut gallery to plant them?  Just go out there and <br/>
do it, have fun with it, and if some people don't like it then they <br/>
don't have to hunt the boxes.  I know I have some boxes like that.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, it sounds like a fun idea for a series.<br/>

game Clue.<br/>
&gt; Once someone has found all 18 boxes, they can make a successful <br/>
accusation<br/>
&gt; (killer, weapon, and room) and I would reward them with a final <br/>
set of clues<br/>
&gt; (letterboxing clues) to a final letterbox.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have a lot of different ideas I want to incorporate into this <br/>
series that<br/>
&gt; I don't want to reveal here because I don't want to give too much <br/>
away, but<br/>
&gt; I think it could be a lot of fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, I realize that this strays pretty far from the letterbox <br/>
tradition<br/>
&gt; of commemorating places, people, events, etc.  Furthermore, it <br/>
would also<br/>
&gt; mean that some of the stamps would be of weaponry (to represent <br/>
the weapons<br/>
&gt; in the game) and would also contain some minimal religious <br/>
iconography (one<br/>
&gt; of the characters is Reverend Green).  As the age suggestion on <br/>
the board<br/>
&gt; game Clue is 7+, I'm pretty sure my series could remain more or <br/>
less family<br/>
&gt; friendly, but ultimately, I wanted to check in with the group at <br/>
large: is<br/>
&gt; this a good idea or should I shelve it?<br/>

No problem doing it again, everyone seems to add their own twist to<br/>
the idea.<br/>
