PILGER WILDLIFE BOX<br/>
<br/>
 From the town of Pilger, take Black Island Road east of town approximately <br/>
two miles on gravel to a sign on the right that delineates the entrance to <br/>
Black Island Wildlife Management area.  Go past the cows and through the <br/>
trees to the parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Take the path leading east.  When it branches, take the left branch.<br/>
<br/>
Continue walking through the trees and the open-ish field with the trees on <br/>
your right.  Find the two big snags that were burned by lightning, and from <br/>
the westernmost tree, look to your right.<br/>
<br/>
Find the tree that holds another trunk in its branches.<br/>
<br/>
 From that tree's base, look east to a fallen log.  In the elbow of the log <br/>
that's been slightly burned, between the bark and the wood, under some <br/>
pieces of bark -- is the Pilger Wildlife box.<br/>
<br/>
MIAO BOX<br/>
<br/>
 From your position at the Pilger Wildlife box (please return it to its <br/>
hidden state, as this area is used by hunters....), head south across the <br/>
ravine.  Go over the other bank (crossing the fallen logs if necessary to <br/>
get over the shallow/not-dangerous water) and continue south a few steps to <br/>
the trampled path going east.<br/>
<br/>
About a hundred steps east will be a tree that has folded a thick branch <br/>
into a natural arch.  Go there.<br/>
<br/>
On the south side of the arch is a tree with a large cubby at its <br/>
base.  Wedged up in the top of the cubby is the box, hidden with a piece of <br/>
wedged bark.  Again, take care in returning the box to its hiding place -- <br/>
it will be very visible in the winter months if you don't.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
