                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just received a postcard in the mail today (dated 8/4/03) stating<br/>
that the Lavender Letterbox was found on the porch of the Franciscan<br/>
Monastery Guest House. This undoubtedly can only mean one thing- it<br/>
has been discovered, and is no longer at it's original hiding place.<br/>
I'm sorry for those who tried to find it as this must have happened<br/>
over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Learned my lesson for putting things in sacred places perhaps&gt;???<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'll take it off the list until further notice.<br/>
Thanks Helen for sending me the postcard and much needed update.<br/>
Bummer that the box is missing as it was lots of fun to make.<br/>
