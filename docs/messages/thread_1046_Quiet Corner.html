<br/>
I just got back from Bigelow Hollow State Park, where I successfully<br/>
completed the 5 letterbox series known as "The Quiet Corner".<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, only 4 of the original 5 still exist. Letterbox #3, the<br/>
Western Point, is definitely missing. This beautiful point, the Drew clan's<br/>
all-time favorite letterbox location, apparently is lots of other people's<br/>
favorite location. There were campers on the point when I arrived ["Hello<br/>
the camp"], there were lots of discarded beer cans throughout the site too.<br/>
The campers and I spent several minutes searching the entire point to no<br/>
avail. The campers were intrigued after I explained the fundamentals of<br/>
letterboxing to them. I suspect that those previous beer guzzlin' visitors<br/>
may have destroyed the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining 4, Bigelow Pond, Pond Point, Breakneck Pond and Nipmuck Trail<br/>
are all safe and sound.<br/>
<br/>
All in all a great day in a great place.<br/>

Today we finished all 5 of the Bigilow Hollow letterboxes. #3 box  was<br/>
there. Doing all of them is a challenge but even my 5 year old did it.<br/>
Even though there was alot of grumbling from him the last Mile. We saw<br/>
two pairs of Canadain geese and a snake.<br/>
