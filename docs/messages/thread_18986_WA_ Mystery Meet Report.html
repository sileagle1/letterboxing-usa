but first, before the revelation---<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Funhog was the only letterboxer from afar who guessed the indentity <br/>
correctly...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but I didn't dare let on....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
not even to Wes...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
or any of the other inquisitive letterboxing types out there...<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the Mystery Guests were:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pete &amp; Wanda <br/>
<br/>
hailing from Rhode Island!!!!!<br/>
(of 5,000+ found letterboxes &amp; <br/>
the Hitchhiker Letterbox Status Website fame)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A fun afternoon/evening was enjoyed by many folks.  Not sure on the <br/>
final count but from what I can remember the following folks joined <br/>
us to welcome Pete &amp; Wanda with true Pacific Northwest Style (I <br/>
apologize totally if I've omitted anybody--I don't have signature <br/>
stamps in my logbook from everybody who attended and I'm going off <br/>
of both my logbook &amp; my awful memory at the moment):<br/>
<br/>
The Howard Family (4) who debuted their new signature stamp at the <br/>
event<br/>
Jessi with her friend &amp; her puppy Kayo<br/>
Keegan the Airedale Terrier &amp; Scout the Barn Cat<br/>
Pirate Dad<br/>
Pirate Mom<br/>
Alicia<br/>
Spiderman<br/>
Blaze<br/>
Shawn<br/>
Brandy<br/>
Mischief<br/>
Twilight<br/>
Sunshine<br/>
Charlie Trail Duster<br/>
Fudrick<br/>
Campfire Lady<br/>
Cat's Meow<br/>
Pandora<br/>
IronBear<br/>
MiniBullyMom<br/>
RayvenDad<br/>
RayvenMom<br/>
RayvenJr<br/>
RayvenDaughter (I'm sorry I can't remember her trail name)<br/>
Ravensburger<br/>
Celt<br/>
Marcus<br/>
Ducky<br/>
Ole Vet incognito as Quilting Noni's signature stamp<br/>
Armyswmr 99<br/>
dvn2r ckr, rnrB &amp; trkr<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know I'm omitting an entire family but, unfortunately, I never got <br/>
their signature stamps.  I think the final count was mid-low 40s.<br/>
<br/>
Meeting all the area letterboxers from near &amp; far was awesome!  It's <br/>
so cool to finally get to put faces with signature stamps and email <br/>
exchanges.  The food was great and the weather held up perfectly.  <br/>
Just threatening enough to discourage all the locals away from the <br/>
park but dry enough to be able to enjoy fellowship, stamp exchanges <br/>
and to seek out a few boxes in the area.  Also, one of the traveling <br/>
letterboxes that Team Rayvenhaus brought was ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!  <br/>
Not sure if they want me to reveal the details of the box on the <br/>
board but, hands down, this letterbox was one of the best I've ever <br/>
seen!  The message, concept, stamp, container, craftsmanship, <br/>
artistic effort--you name it, was simply impressive and the final <br/>
product was stunning! Definitely above &amp; beyond the call of duty!!! <br/>
A great tribute to some true heroes in our lives!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, folks, for joining us to heartily welcome Pete &amp; Wanda to <br/>
the region.  We look forward to seeing you at future gatherings and <br/>
for getting an opportunity to possibly look for a letterbox or two <br/>
you might place in the future!<br/>
