Check route closings if you are planning trips that take you through the mountains of <br/>
Western NC in the near future. Frances took out whole sections of Blue Ridge Parkway <br/>
roadbed. Estimate for repair completion is next year.<br/>
<br/>
Jackson County, NC, (Highlands, Cashiers and Franklin)--US 64 closed due to <br/>
mudslides caused by Ivan. Cashiers is completely cut off and without power.<br/>
<br/>
I-40 between TN border and mile 20 in NC closed in both directions due to roadbed <br/>
washout from Ivan.<br/>
<br/>
I-26 westbound between Asheville and Hendersonville one lane closed due to a <br/>
sinkhole.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of flooding, possible bridge washouts, so check with AAA or something before <br/>
you head in our direction.<br/>

 Hey,<br/>
<br/>
I just got back from Waynesville. It broke my heart to<br/>
see all the damage Ivan did. My friends mothers house<br/>
is gone. Then to see the flood damage....<br/>
Even one of my favorite places on the Blueridge<br/>
Parkway was closed.<br/>
