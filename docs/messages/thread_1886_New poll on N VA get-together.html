Thanks, Bob...the problem was that "make only one choice" was <br/>
selected.  You're right, that wasn't my intention.  I've edited the <br/>
poll so that the respondent can now vote for as many of the dates <br/>
that would be suitable.  Let's try that.  Editing erased the two <br/>
replies that had been received to that point, so please take another <br/>
look and vote again.<br/>
