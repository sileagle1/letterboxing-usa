<br/>
This summer I noticed that a couple of letterboxers were wrapping their stamps in dark felt material (and not putting them in a baggie). Seemed like a good idea - it wasn't messy and kept the ink from getting on the rest of the box contents. So I switched and made little felt pockets to put my stamp into and I didn't place the pocket in a baggie. <br/>
<br/>
I recently got a report that 2 of my boxes have mildewy felt. Hmmmm. I guess felt isn't the best solution. <br/>
<br/>
What does everyone else do? Do you wrap your stamps? In what?<br/>

&gt; &gt; I also wrap mine in felt and then place them inside a baggie. I tried<br/>
&gt; &gt; cardboard stamp holders with a velcro closure, which were nice but<br/>
&gt; seemed<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be continually tearing apart. I also tried felt pockets but they tended<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; hold moisture. I think just wrapping the stamp in a piece of felt allows<br/>
&gt; &gt; the air to still circulate a bit and I haven't had a problem with the<br/>
&gt; felt<br/>
&gt; &gt; becoming damp.<br/>
