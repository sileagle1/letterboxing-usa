Welcome to the club! <br/>
<br/>
You can either buy or make a personal stamp; ditto for the stamps you <br/>
put in your boxes. Not having the former shouldn't deter you from <br/>
participating in this list.<br/>
<br/>
Is the 'Groundhog Box' the one you have to carve over and over for <br/>
eternity before you get it perfect? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 When you 've hidden your box and written the clues, this list is the <br/>
place to send them.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, in what state is Westerly?<br/>
