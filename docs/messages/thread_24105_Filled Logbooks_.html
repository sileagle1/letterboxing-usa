If you make a note in your clues that the box needs a<br/>
new logbook, most finders would be happy to bring<br/>
something along.  I'd much rather do that than be<br/>
confronted with a pile of loose papers that folks have<br/>
stamped on because of a too-full logbook.<br/>

because I THINK having a log book full of wonderful stamps is a part of why<br/>
you planted a box in the first place... so once you have a book full I<br/>
wouldn't want to leave it there and risk it getting lost or damaged or<br/>
stolen.<br/>

<br/>
"6 of one, half dozen of the other," and "damned if you do, damned if you<br/>
don't."  :-)  I think both finders and placers come from their own<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
As a finder, I kind of like to have the logbooks left in the box (if they<br/>
fit) so that I can see all the stamps and comments of finders who came<br/>
before me.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, as a placer, I also want to *eventually* have the<br/>
logbooks myself.  And by leaving filled ones in the box, I'm taking the risk<br/>
of them being damaged by water, losing them if the box goes missing or is<br/>
badly vandalized, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And as both a finder and a placer, I'll take up my position.......sittin'<br/>
right on the fence.<br/>
