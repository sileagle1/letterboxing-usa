<p align="left">Planted by Will (age 11)<br/>easy half hour 
walk<br/><br/>Find the Malerbo Soccer Field at 441 Emmett St. in the 
Forestville<br/>section of Bristol off Rt. 72. Enter the driveway and park 
straight<br/>ahead near a sign board. Take the path to the right of the sign that 
says<br/>Pine Lake Challenge Course. At the first fork stay left and follow 
the<br/>main trail, cross over a wooden bridge, ignoring the path on the 
right<br/>and climb over a log to cross over another wooden bridge. Stay 
straight<br/>on the main path and soon you'll see glimpses of the challenge 
course on<br/>your left. Investigate if you wish (if it's not in use) but the 
treasure<br/>lies ahead of you.. When you come to a gravel path, turn right and 
cross<br/>over a cement pipe bridge built by Pepin Steel and Iron Works (the 
sign<br/>says so). Once over the bridge, the gravel way goes straight you want 
the<br/>wood chips path on your right and ahead of you, you will see logs on 
both<br/>sides of the trail. At the far end of the log on the left, you will 
find<br/>The Mutant Swamp Frog Letterbox. Stamp in, carefully re hide the box 
and<br/>retrace your steps back to your car.</p>
<p align="left">18 steps before the first bridge (on your way back) look to your 
left and you'll see an uprooted tree. This is the third and final resting place 
of The Soccer Challenge letterbox.  This was my signature stamp so I wanted 
it near the fields where I play soccer. With my new stamp, I'll now be known as 
"Warp".               
Stamp in and re hide carefully. Thank you for visiting.</p>
