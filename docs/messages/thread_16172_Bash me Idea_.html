Regarding: Sit Reps - I do like how the database works on <br/>
geocaching.com - check out that site! for big smoke cache it let me <br/>
get the island fox back. I am now checking there before I hid <br/>
stamps. People are signed up watching posts to that cache and you <br/>
can edit your posts. It is a good database thought out and humming.  <br/>
I wonder if they would give us the code/database and we could adapt <br/>
it for letterboxing.org - it is written in ASP - probably over <br/>
mysql. OUr site is better than before and we are getting there BUT <br/>
IT IS SO MUCH WORK and I SO THANK YOU FOR WORKING ON IT!  but this <br/>
is already coded and like wow! and the model is the same as ours <br/>
like = bugs could be HH's - a few tweaks graphic changes and it <br/>
would work for us - <br/>

needs like map and stuff ..<br/>

That's exactly the thought process that's gone into the PNWLb database.  Of<br/>
course, anything created after something else ahs been created can do it<br/>
differently/better.<br/>
<br/>
The current website for letterboxing.org is a phenomenal system, believe me,<br/>
and, from a programmers view point, extremely difficult to do unless you've<br/>
got a ton of programmers working on it. The website at geocaching.com is<br/>
backed by some major money as is evidenced by this from their website:<br/>
<br/>
Get Great Deals on GPS Equipment While Supporting Geocaching.com!<br/>
Our partnership with Offroute.com allows us to bring you dramatic discounts<br/>
on GPS units and accessories. At the same time, a portion of every sale<br/>
comes back to support the continued development of this site!So click on<br/>
over and check out hot new GPS units like the Magellan SporTrak Map or<br/>
Garmin Rino 110 or find the accessory, map or guidebook needed for your next<br/>
geocaching adventure<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those of us, Wes and myself and others, that create the letterboxing sites<br/>
do so out of our own pockets. I've no idea what Wes spends on his site, but<br/>
mine is covered 100% from my pocket.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line?  We'll not get anything form the geocaching site, the<br/>
software/database is copyright protected and not opensource, I've already<br/>
checked! (grin)  As far as the future of letterboxing.org I can not say, I'm<br/>
not involved in that one, but as far as the PNWLb website, I  can speak on<br/>
it, I am a little bit involved in that website! (grin)  Keep an eye on it,<br/>
I'm adding new code each and everyday.  There are a lot of additions planned<br/>
for the near future.<br/>
