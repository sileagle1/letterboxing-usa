<br/>
The Family (in Mass) and I will be headed out to Prudence Island, RI <br/>
next week.  We wanted to see if some local RI boxers had any <br/>
suggestions for boxes we should hit on our way to catch the ferry in <br/>
Bristol.  We aren't looking for major hikes, but quickies or easy <br/>
finds.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I wondered about leaving one on the island and wanted to get <br/>
opinions of RI boxers on this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
I don't live in RI, so I can't answer most of your questions, but <br/>
when I went to college in Providence, I spent an afternoon on <br/>
Patience and Prudence islands walking around.  They are places that <br/>
few travel to, I presume.<br/>
<br/>
Given that there is a ferry that travels there, I think it a great <br/>
idea to plant a box one of the islands ... in fact, I'd go so far as <br/>
to plant TWO -- one on each!  What that will do is encourage people <br/>
to take time to travel to these islands and explore -- something I <br/>
bet most have not done.  After all, isn't travelling to neat places <br/>
you've not been to before half the appeal of letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>

Please do! Prudence and Prudence Islands are among the few RI places<br/>
I've never visited. I'd love to have an excuse.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Prudence Island is really a neat little place. There's a couple of <br/>
sanctuary type places and there's some trails that you could plant <br/>
boxes on. <br/>
<br/>
One caution -- There's a type of tick on Prudence Island called the <br/>
LoneStar tick. They're kind of an orangy color and look way different <br/>
than the usual critters found in the area. <br/>
