box.  I was within a foot of a raccoon looksing for food.  This is a <br/>
lovely secluded spot very close to the busy highway.  If only you <br/>
didn't have to listen to all the trucks, you would think you were in <br/>
the middle of nowhere.<br/>
<br/>
The box is still there and waiting for more visitors.<br/>
