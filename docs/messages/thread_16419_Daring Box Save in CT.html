Wanda finally got back from her trail work trips out on the CDT in <br/>
CO and NM just in time for us to have another great annual <br/>
"Walking Weekend" in northeastern CT.  We attended interesting <br/>
walks and talks by state geologists, historians and naturalists, <br/>
but one of the more amusing moments of the weekend came <br/>
when Wanda literally snatched a letterbox out of a tree hollow <br/>
just seconds before the Conn College botany professor leading <br/>
the tree identification walk started pointing it out as a great <br/>
"wildlife habitat hole"!  Some 60 people had gathered for the <br/>
walk at the Nathan Hale Homestead in Coventry, CT and were <br/>
headed down the leafy lane behind it when we began to worry <br/>
that "Uncle Sam's Nephew" might be located in a somewhat <br/>
precarious position for this type of event.  Sure enough, as we <br/>
approached, several of the "front walkers" in the group started <br/>
pointing out the curiously rocky hollow in that particular ash tree!  <br/>
Fortunately, the professor stopped just long enough to divert <br/>
attention to an adjacent tulip tree for Wanda to slip in and remove <br/>
the letterbox.  It was all we could do to refrain from chuckling as <br/>
the professor then turned to go poking into that ash tree's hole <br/>
while describing all the things that might possibly have made <br/>
their home in there, while Wanda clutched the box to her chest <br/>
with a feeling of having saved "Planet Earth"!  (If you get there <br/>
soon, you'll know what we mean :-)  )  We put the box back in its <br/>
hole after everyone had finished the tour and tried to leave it <br/>
looking a little more natural by sprinkling a few leaves on it.  <br/>
Hope it lasts a while yet without attracting too much attention!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>

Thanks for the great save. Planet Earth is a HH I started some time<br/>
ago. My others are long out of the state but It's interesting the PE<br/>
is still around. I had no idea. You must have had a great chuckle on<br/>
that rescue!<br/>
Always,<br/>
