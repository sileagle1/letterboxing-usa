&gt; but you'll understand what's going on inside.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to agree.  The problem with programs like FrontPage or other <br/>
editors is that eventually, you'll want to do something that it's not <br/>
capable of.  Some small tweak or addition that without knowing HTML, <br/>
you won't be able to do.  And even if you DON'T ever need to make any <br/>
tweaks, there's something to be said about knowing how it <br/>
works 'under the hood'.<br/>
<br/>
I've changed the oil on a car before.  I know how to check the oil <br/>
level on my car.  It's a good skill to have!  But I still take my car <br/>
into Jiffy Lube (or whereever) and have them do the work every 3 <br/>
months or 3,000 miles.  It's quicker and easier that way, but I still <br/>
have a basic idea of what they're doing to my car, and I wouldn't <br/>
want it any other way!<br/>
<br/>
But seriously, if you're going to make your own webpages, knowing the <br/>
basics of HTML is essential.  After that, I'd look into programs you <br/>
might use to speed up the process.  When I was wandering around <br/>
Central America creating clues, I didn't always have FrontPage or <br/>
other editors to do the work for me, and I would have no other option <br/>
than something like Notepad.<br/>
