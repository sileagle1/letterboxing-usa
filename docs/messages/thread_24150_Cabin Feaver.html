here in northern Maine for the past month and I am<br/>
sick and tired of it.  We have a fair amount of snow<br/>
now and more coming soon.  There is just no way to do<br/>
any boxing up here in the winter.  Everything is<br/>
frozen over.  There are several boxes between my house<br/>
and town that I pass everyday and just sigh....  I<br/>
can't wait till spring gets here.  I won't even wait<br/>
for things to dry up, I'll be out there in the spring<br/>
mud huntin' down boxes fer sure.<br/>
<br/>
We will be vacationing near Bar Harbor, Maine the week<br/>
of March 4th and I hope the weather will allow me to<br/>
hit a few boxes down there on de island.  Anyone near<br/>
BH that wants to meet up for coffee and a stamp<br/>
exchange? <br/>

Our Colorado winter has been brutal (over sixty days of ground cover) and we haven't been able to get out for traditional boxes since Decembers.  It's a friendly surprise from other boxers in the mail (and the stamps are amazing!)  I think I would be very sad if I didn't get to have at least this connection with others during this lllooonnnggg winter!<br/>

hasn't been too terribly bad, I'm getting really bad cabin feaver. <br/>
This winter I have gone searching for a couple boxes in my area only to <br/>

there like in the teens and below.  Last couple days got some <br/>
snowshoeing in as well it was in the 40's!!!  I understand the cabin <br/>
fever though.  My last find was in the end of Jan, looked for one Feb 2 <br/>
but no find.  <br/>
