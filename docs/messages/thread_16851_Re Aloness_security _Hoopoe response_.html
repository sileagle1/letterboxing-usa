  I have to subscribe to the theory that random acts of violence are <br/>
a fact of life. We should use our basic common sense and intuition to <br/>
avert personal harm as best we can. Therefore,as another yahoo group <br/>
mission statement says, let's all practice random acts of kindness. <br/>
Perhaps, make a point of chatting with elderly  people in public <br/>
places and offering them help. I hve found this to be a comfort to me <br/>
and wel received by the people who are the recipients. <br/>
