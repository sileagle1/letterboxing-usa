Der Mad Stamper's Columbia River Gorge Falls series.  However, for <br/>
quite a while, two of those boxes have been missing.<br/>
<br/>
Since Mr. Stamper was kind enough to scan the pictures of the stamps <br/>
along with the clues, and I had gotten the three stamps that were <br/>
still there so I could shrink the scanned pictures to the right size, <br/>
I recarved the stamps and replaced the two long-lost boxes!  =)<br/>
<br/>
The new stamps are as identical to the old ones as my hands could <br/>
carve.  I tried to figure out where the original locations were, but <br/>
in one case needed to move the stamp to a completely new location.<br/>
<br/>
For the Ponytail Falls box, the clue should get you there.  I think <br/>
I've got it near the right tree (not AT the pine tree, but within a <br/>
stone's throw of it), and even dragged a small log to it so it would <br/>
better match the given clue.  Don't get hung up on the log, though.  <br/>
Like I said, it's a small log and might move before you find the <br/>
box!  Just search for the box under a small rock.  (The clue says to <br/>
look under a large rock, and there IS a large rock, but it doesn't <br/>
look like a very good place to be hiding letterboxes.)<br/>
<br/>
The Wahkeena Falls letterbox: The stamp has one major flaw if you <br/>
compare it to the original carving, but it's a fine looking stamp <br/>
just the same.  By itself, you wouldn't notice anything wrong with <br/>
it.  The landmarks for this clue are all gone as far as I can tell, <br/>
and the original location--the best I could determine--doesn't hide a <br/>
letterbox very well at all.  So I hid this in a TOTALLY new location <br/>
near Wahkeena Falls.  Ignore the clues on the webpage.<br/>
<br/>
To find the new letterbox, continue past the stone bridge to a trail <br/>
junction.  One direction--toward Multnomah Falls--is fenced off.  <br/>
(Has been for years.  I'm skeptical if they'll ever reopen the <br/>
trail.)  Follow the stone wall in that direction.  At the end of the <br/>
stone wall, another more primitive type of stone "wall" begins.  A <br/>
stone wall with lots of large cracks and holes.  Yep, the box is <br/>
hidden in one of the holes.  (Think Horsetail Falls letterbox.)  A <br/>
couple of small rocks cover the opening.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Web Masters: I'd let Mitch update his own page as he wants.  *shrug*  <br/>
These aren't meant to be new boxes, just replacements for missing <br/>
ones.<br/>
