 Still don't know about the stamp carving thing.  I will have to <br/>
practice, practice, practice!! <br/>
<br/>
My first attempt at carving was with an eraser that was very hard to <br/>
carve into, and the stamp looked extremely crude. Regardless of how <br/>
crude and ugly the stamp looked, I was impressed that the stamp that <br/>
lacked artistic quality could produce an image that was unique and <br/>
rather interesting. I looked around for the "pink stuff" and the <br/>
stuff that "carves like butter" that everyone had been talking about, <br/>
but had difficulty finding it in the S.F. Bay area. About the same <br/>
time that I was hunting for a better quality medium I meet Funhog. <br/>
She gave me a quick carving lession (Thank you Funhog), and made the <br/>
suggestion of hunting for the good stuff at either a college art <br/>
store or to try mail order. After letting my finger do the walking on <br/>
the internet, I found Dick Blick (got to love this name) Art supply <br/>
on the internet, and they had the good stuff: Staedtler Master <br/>
Carve.  Man! The stuff does carve like butter. Wish I had tried this <br/>
stuff first, but then I wouldn't have my naked traveler. <br/>
Try finding a carver for lessions.<br/>
Have fun carving!<br/>

although I find his website difficult to find stuff on. I was trying for a #1 carving <br/>
'gouge' and looked for a half hour before finding it--and now I can't <br/>
remember how I finally found it to tell you about it! I'd heard that Michael's craft <br/>
store had beginning carving kits from Speedball, but I had to look in about a <br/>
dozen Michaels' stores before I found one that carried them. They are great <br/>
though. The "pink stuff" in the kit is my personal favorite carving medium. <br/>
These kits are very inexpensive (especially with the 40% off coupon found in <br/>
Sunday papers each week)<br/>
and I highly recommend them. You'll be able to use the carving tools forever <br/>
and they give you enough pink stuff for about 4-6 stamps all for about $10.00 <br/>
(without coupon). Good luck!<br/>
