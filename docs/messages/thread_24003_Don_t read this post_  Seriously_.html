                    <div class="plaintext-content">Goodness!  Such a lot of chatter!  Sorry I missed so much, but it <br/>
was WAY to pretty outside today to stay in and sit at the `puter.  <br/>
Sadly, there were one or two points I needed to address, since they <br/>
were directed at me, so I warn you now!  Do not read this post!  <br/>
Stay away!  It's all just more blah, de-blah, blah, blah...<br/>
<br/>
Still here?  Ok.<br/>
<br/>
To Saunter (note: some letterboxer names may have been changed to <br/>
protect the innocent):<br/>
<br/>
 "So then who gets to decide what the "extreme" is and who <br/>
the "ridiculous people" are? You? :-)"   ~ LOL!  Well, I guess we <br/>
ALL do, don't we?  At least for ourselves.  It seems like your mind <br/>
is pretty well made up, no?  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
"As far as traveling goes, personally, if I'm going to be traveling <br/>
to an area, I take the time to do things like join the regional <br/>
list..."  ~ Oh, you mean like the three I'm already on?  And the <br/>
regional group blog I'm on?  Plus this national list, of course - <br/>
make for a full inbox some days!<br/>
<br/>
"Oh, that's right! You don't have the time! So the proper way for <br/>
EVERYONE to play the game is to play the game based on YOUR time <br/>
schedule and how you prioritize YOUR time."  ~ WHOOP-WHOOP-WHOOP!  <br/>
Look out!  Here come the Snark Police!  ;-D<br/>
<br/>
"David was the only one throwing a temper tantrum..."  ~ Wow.  You <br/>
read an awful lot into what he said.  Including intonation.  That's <br/>
a real talent!  I didn't get "tantrum" when I read his post, but I <br/>
guess I'm just dim like that.<br/>
<br/>
"Because I've never attended a gathering and probably never will."  <br/>
~ Sad, that.  Lots of nice people.  You might like one or two, maybe <br/>
make a new friend.  I know I did!<br/>
<br/>
"Think of all the research you could have done while you were <br/>
traveling 900 miles to that gathering."  ~ Actually, I was working <br/>
on some of the more mysterious clues for the gather boxes while on <br/>
the plane!  Does that count?<br/>
<br/>
"I would rather search the internet in hopes of finding some of the <br/>
more obscure boxes than partying."  ~ That's fabulous.  I had a <br/>
great time at that gather and hope to go back next year if they have <br/>
another one.  <br/>
<br/>
"But somehow I get the feeling that YOUR priorities are the PROPER <br/>
priorities. I think both priorities are pretty reasonable for the <br/>
people who hold them."  ~ Again, I think you may be reading a lot <br/>
into what I had said.  I think mayhaps YOUR priorities are PROPER <br/>
for YOU and MINE are PROPER for ME!  Whatever!  :-)  This is <br/>
cracking me up!<br/>
<br/>
"...or hittin' the road with a couple of friends to find a few of <br/>
the more obscure letterboxes we've researched and found clues to."  <br/>
~ You box with others?  I find that surprising!  You sound like a <br/>
solo act.  You know, a lone wolf.  Also, from the looks of the list, <br/>
you spend the day typing...did you get out at all?  I hope so  I <br/>
think the Weather Channel said it was lovely all over the Midwest <br/>
today!<br/>
<br/>
To David:<br/>
<br/>
"Many people plant their boxes to bring people to new places. Some <br/>
just go there for the box and others take advantage of nature as I <br/>
hope they do. Why would I want to make that opportunity hard to <br/>
find? Thank you John and Ryan for your LBNA and AQ."  <br/>
~ Hear, hear!  I was so thrilled to hear from a boxer, driving from <br/>
New Jersey to California this summer with her husband and <br/>
three "crabby" kids, who got off the highway to get my series in <br/>
Tower Grove.  She thanked me warmly and was downright effusive about <br/>
this lovely urban oasis that she otherwise would never have <br/>
seen...it just made my day!<br/>
<br/>
To AutumnHen:<br/>
<br/>
"Wow! Take a pill -- you are awfully rude."  ~ Thank you; I will use <br/>
you as a shining example of politeness!  :-D<br/>
<br/>
"Why do you think it is okay to be a finder but not a planter...hunt <br/>
for letterboxes without ever offering anything in return (which you <br/>
seem to feel is okay)"  ~  Whaaah?  I never said that!  Sorry if I <br/>
misspoke somewhere... I can't seem to find the reference for your <br/>
inference.  FWIW, I started planting three months after I started <br/>
hunting.  Because I'm a giving nurturer like that. <br/>
<br/>
"there are many people who feel the hunt is not just about finding <br/>
the box, but also about sniffing out the clues."  ~  Right.  So they <br/>
should sniff out clues, and not just pop over to the big lists and <br/>
grab those simple little easy spoon-feeds, don't cha think?  <br/>
<br/>
"That would be about as silly as saying that a person who makes <br/>
difficult clues is being exclusionary because some people just <br/>
aren't going to be able to figure them out."  ~ I think most people <br/>
who enjoy this game as more than a passing fancy enjoy the more <br/>
difficult clues!  I have worked out puzzles for boxes I'll probably <br/>
never get because they're just too darn far away  but I did enjoy <br/>
the puzzles.  And I have those clues stashed away, in case fate ever <br/>
does blow me their way.  I've got "Dancing Men" saved to work on <br/>
during holiday break, but I don't anticipate getting to New England <br/>
any time soon...maybe if I work it out, I can email the planter and <br/>
get a digital photo of the stamp!<br/>
<br/>
"Nobody owes you anything, certainly not to put clues smack dab in <br/>
front of your face. Lucky for you many people do, so you should <br/>
still have plenty of boxes to find without putting too much extra <br/>
effort into it."  ~ Here come the Snark Police again!  Quick!  <br/>
Hide!  Oh, wait  that was another example of politeness in action  <br/>
Yes, I'm a lazy, lazy boxercould you please read this clue aloud <br/>
for me, I'm too laaaaaazy (Sorry.  All this snarkiness is <br/>
infectious  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
To Stinky Pop:<br/>
<br/>
"Might as well just merge with geocaching at this point."   ~ My <br/>
friend who started my addiction calls them "geotrashes".  Having <br/>
only seen one, I have to agree with herwhat a waste of good <br/>
tupperware!<br/>
<br/>
To stargazermama:<br/>
<br/>
"Now 4 years later, it's still the end of the world? Mapsurfer <br/>
hasn't raptured you guys yet?"    ~  ROFLMAO!  Priceless!<br/>
<br/>
As an official "there are no rules" person, I hereby proclaim that <br/>
all boxers have the right to handle their clues in any manner they <br/>
see fit. And the rest of us have the right to roll our eyes and <br/>
sigh."  ~ Sounds good.  My clues will now contain the <br/>
disclaimer "You may not search for this box until you have planted <br/>
one yourself, and posted clues here, and sent me a personal note <br/>
fawning over my great clueage."  Ouch!  I sprained my eyeballz!  :-D<br/>
<br/>
To Coaster Man:<br/>
<br/>
"If they don't want to post boxes on the internet that is fine. But <br/>
don't go crying that other people do, and further use those <br/>
resources to get clues themselves. What is it? Either the internet <br/>
is good or not."  ~  Good point.  Leads me to (drum roll, maestro, <br/>
please)<br/>
<br/>
the one that started it all<br/>
<br/>
To Fido:<br/>
<br/>
"Really, it's too bad that others can't realize that listing clues <br/>
online is a poor way to go."  ~ Does this mean that you prefer the <br/>
Dartmoor method, folks just dig around in parks looking for SPORS?  <br/>
Does it mean you actually DO list online, just not at one of the two <br/>
big sites?  Does it mean WOM is the way to go?  If others don't <br/>
realize this, what do you know that we/they don't?  Please, impart <br/>
your wisdom, slowly and clearly so even a big dummy like me can <br/>
understand.  Seriously.  I'd like to know your beefemail me off <br/>
list even.  Curiosity kills, ya know.<br/>
<br/>
"And to answer your question about what my problem is with people <br/>
finding clues online and searching for my boxes?  Well, that's more <br/>
complex."   ~ Oooo...mysterious.  I love a mystery!  ;-D<br/>
<br/>
Goodness, but I'm long-winded tonight.  I'm glad I type fast!  I've <br/>
learned a lot skimming thru these posts (yes, I deleted some half-<br/>
read and wanted to respond here mostly to those kind, lovely, gentle <br/>
folk who chose to spend so much of their time today responding to <br/>
me).  Since I'm a relatively new boxer in a region somewhat devoid <br/>
of activity, these lists are my main connection to the hobby.  I <br/>
know now that I need to spend a lot more time on google.  I've <br/>
learned which folks on this list have a splendid sense of humor!  <br/>
And I've learned that there's probably a gazillion boxes in my area, <br/>
but everyone is playing off-line and won't tell me.<br/>
<br/>
You know, if you've read this far, you deserve a prize.  Tell ya <br/>
what  email me off list and say "Rutabaga!"  When I get my big <br/>
series planted (which, granted, may be a while yet), I'll email you <br/>
the clues a month before I post them to AQ.  Thanks!  Have a good <br/>
week!<br/>
