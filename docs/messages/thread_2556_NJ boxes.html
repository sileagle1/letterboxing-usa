Sorry for the duplicate note to See Joy, but I get the archives and for some reason don't seem to get all the messages, so I didn't know that one had gone through.  <br/>
<br/>
Todd, where's your clues for the Somerset county boxes you promised, I enjoy searching out boxes during the week, and don't get too many opportunites  :)  I'll make you a deal, you post another one and I'll post another one :)  (after I hide it of course)<br/>

Its a deal!  I  should have the clues to the Somerset county boxes up soon.  How soon thereafter shall I expect your next set of clues? ;-)<br/>
