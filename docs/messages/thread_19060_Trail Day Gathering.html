<br/>
The Trail Day Gathering is finally upon us.  There was some <br/>
confusion over who and what will be happening.  Here is the low down.<br/>
<br/>
All the original activities are still going to happen.  Any <br/>
letterboxers helping in trail maintenance will walk the trails with <br/>
garbage bags to clean litter from the trails.  Lunch will NOT be <br/>
provided as it was unclear who would and would not be available to <br/>
help.  Randy Hall will be presenting his Letterboxing discussion <br/>
with copies of the famous letterboxing book.  Brian (of team green <br/>
dragon) was forced to cancel due to family commitments.  However, I <br/>
will be teaching a similar class on Stamp Carving 101.  Anyone who <br/>
has notified me of camping will meet at 3:00 with the park director <br/>
so that she can go over park rules as well as assign our camping <br/>
area.  After this meeting everyone is invited to Rosie Tomorrow's <br/>
for grub.  After dinner we will return to Tarrywile for some "Things <br/>
That Go Bump In The Night" Letterboxes, campfire, and restful sleep <br/>
in our tents.  I hope this answers anyones questions.  I understand <br/>
there are many people spreading information and much of it contrasts <br/>
what i have written.  Believe me ... It's all set!  If you have any <br/>
questions ... drop me an email at Letterboxer2002@yahoo.com<br/>
