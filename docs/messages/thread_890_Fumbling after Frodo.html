Well, sometime over the past couple of months I had the opportunity<br/>
to track down the Frodo's Dream mystery box <br/>
(http://www.sover.net/~tcooch/frodo.htm).<br/>
<br/>
I think I found the starting point, which is often half the fun, and <br/>
if I didn't, what I found certainly _should_ be the starting point <br/>
for something :-)  Then I spent three hours wandering down the garden<br/>
path, as it turns out, hopelessly making my discoveries and ovservations<br/>
fit the clues.<br/>
<br/>
In the end I struck out, but it just goes to show that it can be just <br/>
as much fun not to find a box as it is to find one.  Thanks Tom!<br/>
I still have some leads, hopefully my travel schedule will allow me to <br/>
try them out later this year ...<br/>

it. I think that once you have the starting point, the rest of it <br/>
comes around pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I, meanwhile, am having a lot of fun with your quatrains, though have <br/>
not gotten enough of them solved for the clues to begin revealing <br/>
themselves. I don't suppose you'd like to supply a picture for the Mu <br/>
quatrain  :-)<br/>

Best,<br/>
