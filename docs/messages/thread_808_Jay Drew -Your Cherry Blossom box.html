Sad news on your Cherry Blossoms box. We went out for the weekend, to hunt<br/>
your five boxes, among others. We went out to Hains Point, and began the<br/>
hunt<br/>
for your box. The area on the other side of the fence has been cleared out.<br/>
<br/>
Completely flattened, with a huge pile of dead trees and stones they seem to<br/>
be removing. There was also a large hole in the fence, where the brush was<br/>
spilling over. I don't know if it was just luck, but your box was just<br/>
sitting in the middle of the paved footpath that ran along the fence. We<br/>
had<br/>
an idea where the box should have gone, but as they were in the middle of<br/>
clearing out the area, we thought it would be pointless to pick up some<br/>
stones<br/>
to rehide the box. We figured we were lucky enough to find the box, so we<br/>
took it home with us. I knew if we left it, no one would be finding it. <br/>
Would you like me to send it to you, or just bring it to the gathering in<br/>
the<br/>
spring? There are a couple of stamps already in it. It was intact and<br/>
everything. Which was surprising, considering it was sitting in the open. <br/>
Whichever you'd prefer, let me know. All your other boxes were great,<br/>
though.<br/>
:)<br/>

must have been the letterboxing fairies watching over us for you to end<br/>
up in just that place at just that time. I mean, think of how many<br/>
people must have passed by...we'd be delighted if you'd adopt the box<br/>
for the winter renovations and then re-hide it when you think it's<br/>
safe. What a sweet offer! And if they tear that area up a little and it<br/>
needs some adjustment when you put it in, just give us the directions<br/>
and we'll edit the cluesheet on the web (and have a good excuse to go<br/>
re-find it when we're in DC this June!). Again, thank you very much,<br/>
and have a terrific time in Massachusetts.<br/>

Jay and family<br/>

 Kimberly was the one that found and rescued your box.  But, since she's <br/>
from New Jersey, and I'm in DC, it would not be a problem for me to replace <br/>
it, or to look after it.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to hit the other Drew Clan DC boxes shortly. And will make sure to <br/>
have my own in place before the Drew Clan visit in June!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Kimberly -- can you send it to me?<br/>
