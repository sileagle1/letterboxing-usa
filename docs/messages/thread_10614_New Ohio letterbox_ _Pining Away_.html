                    <div class="plaintext-content">Title: "Pining Away". Location: Great Seal State Park, near <br/>
Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio. Difficulty:Moderate. Placed 2-2-03 by <br/>
Salamander. CLUES: Begin at the sign identifying the Spring <br/>
Run/Picnic Loop trail entrance; this is just west of the Ireland <br/>
Picnic area parking lot. Follow the trail, veering to the right where <br/>
it forks immediately after the entrance, until you reach a man-made <br/>
object approximately 12 feet long. Stand in front of the center of <br/>
this object (west/northwest side).Straight down the slope in front of <br/>
you, at a heading of 292 degrees, is a small Holly tree. Go to that <br/>
tree. Standing at its northwest side, take a reading of 307 degrees. <br/>
Depending on the season, you may or may not be able to see a large <br/>
Cedar tree not too far away at that heading. Even if you cannot see <br/>
it, if you walk in that direction, you will reach it shortly. From <br/>
the Cedar tree, go 8 paces at 195 degrees to a fallen log. The <br/>
letterbox is under a fork in the log. NOTE: Depending on what time of <br/>
year you visit the park, you may find the trail extremely muddy and <br/>
slippery, and off-trail areas can be very thick with brambles and <br/>
brush. Please use appropriate caution. <br/>
