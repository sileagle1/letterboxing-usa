<br/>
Based on a recent conversation with another boxer, I began to think about the tons of images we as boxers get, and what we do with them.  People like God (Godfrey Swinscow the "godfather of letterboxing") collects images.  As he can no longer walk the tors and moors, boxers send him images which are scanned and kept in his dozens of binders. (each binder holds about 1500 images).  It seems that scanning them and filing tnem is popular in the UK.  People have databases so the can query them by location.. number... subject. (I considering that one seriously)<br/>
<br/>
Short of selling them for profit, or other monetary gain, what can a boxer do with the images they have.  If I died tomorrow, and decided to bequeath all my logbooks, from box hunts, exchanges... yatta yatta,  to my cousin Hildegarde, would it matter? Do I have to ask the creator of each and every image permission before I write my last will and testament? If I decided to give up boxing today (like that'll ever happen) should I burn my logbooks? (I shudder at the mere thought!)  Do I send them to the Smithsonian?<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering....<br/>

We can no more dictate who holds the image of any given stamp than we can dictate who is allowed to visit the box once it has been placed.  <br/>
Some folks think that to have an image that has been collected by someone else is wrong and unforgiveable, my response to this ?.............tosh!!!  I place boxes and care not one jot who inks the stamp so long as people gain enjoyment from it !<br/>
Lets keep letterboxing free of politics.<br/>
Well thats my opinion old beans and I'm sticking with it. lol :-)<br/>
Have fun and stay safe.<br/>

Excellent idea!  <br/>
<br/>
I've always said that my goal is to be a "character" when I am old.  <br/>
This should just about put the lid on it.  <br/>
<br/>
"I, Zed, being of sound mind but failing health, do hereby direct <br/>
that all my letterboxing logs, journals, carving tools, carving <br/>
blocks, potential images, stamps, ink pads, markers, walking sticks, <br/>
ziploc bags, rubber bands, pens, paper towels, first aid kits, <br/>
plastic containers, film canisters, camo-tape, clue sheets, <br/>
compasses, backpacks, and any and all sundry paraphernalia used in <br/>
the execution of the sport or hobby or letterboxing be herewith <br/>
buried with me.  I further direct that funds from my estate be <br/>
expended, as necessary, to purchase as many additional coffins as <br/>
needed to fulfill said request.  And, so as not to waste the unused <br/>
material, I further direct that my heirs and executors forthwith <br/>
create and post at www.letterboxing.org clues of medium difficulty <br/>
leading to my grave-stash, so that other boxers may benefit from my <br/>
demise."<br/>
<br/>
My burial plot is at the gorgeous Hollywood cemetery in Richmond, <br/>
VA - so you'll have a wonderful time finding my stash.  Bring <br/>
flowers.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
