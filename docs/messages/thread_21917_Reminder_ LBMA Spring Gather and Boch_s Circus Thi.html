Place: Black Hill Regional Park (Shelter J), Boyds (Germantown), <br/>
Maryland<br/>
Time: 11 a.m.  4 p.m.<br/>
<br/>
As of today I am expecting at least 70 attendees. If you plan to <br/>
attend and haven't rsvp'd yet, PLEASE signup at <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/ or email me at donnas28@juno.com. <br/>
<br/>
To get to Black Hill Park: Take I-270 to exit 18 (Rte. 121 towards <br/>
Boyds). Drive 2 miles and turn left on West Old Baltimore Rd. Drive <br/>
1 mile and turn right on Lake Ridge Drive. Just past the Park <br/>
Manager's Office, turn left. Shelter J is the second parking lot on <br/>
the right.<br/>
<br/>
The gather will officially start at 11 a.m., but there are plenty of <br/>
letterboxes to find if you want to come early. We will have an event <br/>
table where you can pick up a name tag, stamp into the event log <br/>
and, if you will be playing the "Clue" game, receive your game <br/>
pieces and instructions from Scarab (see next paragraph). A group <br/>
photo will be taken between 2 and 3. A note regarding hitchhikers: <br/>
some HH placers prefer not to have them passed around at gathers. <br/>
Therefore we are requesting that you keep HHs on the trails and on <br/>
the move. :)<br/>
<br/>
More details regarding the Clue Exchange Game (1:00 pm): To play <br/>
Clue Exchange you must sign up at the gather for a pre-made stamp, <br/>
or pre-register your own new stamp with Scarab (thedoubtfulguests at <br/>
yahoo dot com).  There are only some 23 pre-made classic Clue stamps <br/>
so first come, first served. But if you carve your own we need to <br/>
know what it is to pre-print it on the clue sheets. (Perhaps you <br/>
could carve an extra one so someone else can play. Afterwards you <br/>
can make it a hitchhiker.) Please see the Clue rules listed on <br/>
AtlasQuest under the Clue Magnifier and Rules Letterbox. Scarab will <br/>
continuously update it with a list of the stamps available and being <br/>
brought. <br/>
<br/>
Charcoal fires and hotdogs/rolls will be provided. Attendees are <br/>
asked to bring a potluck dish or canned drinks to share (see growing <br/>
list below). The shelter has a lot of picnic tables, but you may <br/>
want to bring a folding chair. <br/>
<br/>
Print out letterbox clues in advance (Boyds, Germantown, Damascus, <br/>
Gaithersburg, Hyattstown, Laytonsville or as far as you want to <br/>
venture). The Boch's Circus clues will be put online before the <br/>
13th, so print those too. The Circus boxes will remain in place <br/>
until the end of May. After that the Circus will be packed up to <br/>
move on to other venues. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your amazing response to this event. If you have <br/>
questions, don't hesitate to ask. See you on Saturday, rain or shine!<br/>

 A circus huh? Well I guess that's better than the jab in the eye <br/>
with a pointy stick I was expecting. I'm sure that there will be <br/>
plenty of FINE folks there. YOU'RE expecting quite a crowd. Maybe I <br/>
can find that GIRL I've been searching for. Perhaps you will bump <br/>
into me, just say "Hello", introduce yourself, and I would be glad <br/>
to make an exchange.<br/>

 Well, back to this bottle of BRANDY, it's not like it is going to <br/>
