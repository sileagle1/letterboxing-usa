                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well now the little fellow looks like one of those east coast types.  <br/>
However many crabs are cannibalistic ( hoopoe puts on her science <br/>
geek cap).  However this Dungeness crab was so good and so sweet and <br/>
so perfect  ( and $2.99 a lb !)that I am afraid there was not enough <br/>
to go around ;-) He might have to make do with the left overs.<br/>

Now about our Washington State Park issue.  This is an issue near and <br/>
not so dear to my heart.  It certainly pre-dates the car tab <br/>
initiative issue.  A club I belong to, Lake Washington Saddle Club, <br/>
has been very involved in this issue for many years.  Bridle Trails <br/>
SP was founded when farmers on the east side of Seattle bought a <br/>
section of land ( 1 mile square) so that the people of the then rural <br/>
east side could have a place to enjoy equestrian activities.  This <br/>
was 1946.  In the 60's the group sold the park to the state as a <br/>
state park.  Singularly unique in the USA it had become a major venue <br/>
for horse shows (humble as it is) in the Pacific Northwest and <br/>
Canada.  <br/>
<br/>
Wisely someone had the forethought to retain the funds raised by the <br/>
Saddle Club instead of putting it in the states General Fund ( where <br/>
most income generated in this fashion by park use go) We retain the <br/>
control of the funds we raise by putting on horse shows ( mostly <br/>
local unrated fun shows) and pay them out to our ranger and board as <br/>
needed for the improvement of the park.  We also use funds to work on <br/>
issues pertaining to the development of the neighborhood and <br/>
contributions to special groups and individuals ( Olympic candidates, <br/>
riding for the handicap, schools programs)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone not knowing this area what was a once rural farm studded area <br/>
has now grown into the cities of Kirkland Bellevue and Redmond.  <br/>
Microsoft HQ is about 1 mile from the park and the property <br/>
surrounding the park and indeed several cities and towns within 5 <br/>
miles are home to some of the richest ( and THE richest) people in <br/>
the region.<br/>
<br/>
A beautiful second growth forest smack dab in the middle of the <br/>
largest metro area of the state.  No longer the hub of equestrian <br/>
activity for the region we struggle along to preserve this beautiful <br/>
venue for all to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
It has been number one on the states hit list for quite some time.  <br/>
We pressured the powers and received a stay.  We formed the Save Our <br/>
Park Foundation and worked to activate awareness around the state.  <br/>
Now we are setting up a non-profit tax exempt foundation.  We are <br/>
trying to raise 1 million (+) to preserve the park for all to enjoy.  <br/>
The state requires $80,000 / year to maintain this park as an open <br/>
facility.  I doubt our club, even in its peak years, could ever raise <br/>
such a level of funds.  When assigning points to each state park a( <br/>
to determine the hit list about 4 or 5 years ago now) the park <br/>
received no points for "uniqueness" nor for impact to neighborhood if <br/>
lost ( many homes are "horse acres" and there are about 8 - 10 <br/>
equestrian facilities on the park)<br/>
<br/>
My question is, are the fees raised going to the General fund or will <br/>
they be state park income specifically?<br/>
<br/>
I have no objection to a yearly parking sticker fee.  However the <br/>
amount is not a major burden for me.  I fear that people who ARE <br/>
casual users of state parks will be kept away.  This is particularly <br/>
painful for the urban people who have little contact with nature and <br/>
the ultra rural people who have little choice of public land use. ( <br/>
there is also a parking and permit fee for state forest access a <br/>
majority of the public land in isolated areas)<br/>
<br/>
I cheer the Head Nails notion of Starter Kits and parking passes to <br/>
those who might want to use them.  I would like to see Parking passes <br/>
given to organizations such as the Y, community centers, social <br/>
agencies and spiritual centers where people who can make use of <br/>
the "free day" can pick up a pass to use.  <br/>
<br/>
Well too long and rambling but, as you can see, an issue that is near <br/>
and dear to my heart.  I consider BTSP the Heart of my soul and have <br/>
found much delight in our state many varied parks.  I came to the <br/>
great outdoors late in life.  I just hope they are open and welcoming <br/>
for all to enjoy 10 or 20 years from now.  <br/>
<br/>
Washington's track record is very poor ( 2nd to last of the 14 <br/>
western states in spending on parks and public lands) <br/>
<br/>
 Everyone pay attention.  You never know when you will be called upon <br/>
to defend the  "public" land you love.<br/>
