the list regarding some abandoned boxes in Missouri.<br/>
<br/>
My mother lives in MO and I was checking to see if there were many boxes out<br/>
there.  I was sad to see there are still a number of abandoned boxes out<br/>
there.  I thought about adopting them myself, but as I only get out there<br/>
once a year or so (blast that limited vacation time), I don't think I would<br/>
be the most effective resource, especially since my mom actually lives in<br/>
Lebanon, so I'm not in the north very much.<br/>
<br/>
Have efforts been made to find contact info on the placers of these boxes?<br/>
If so, is there anyone that would be willing to become a caretaker?  I hate<br/>
to lose them when there weren't a great number of boxes anyway.<br/>
<br/>
So let me know . . . Good luck out there, and I will be sure to make some<br/>
plants for you when I come out next.  Maybe we can have an exchange :-)<br/>

Hi, Malinda!!<br/>
<br/>
You found letterboxing in the same sort of backwards way I did!  :)  I'm a<br/>
Carving Consortium member, too, and have discovered a whole new way to use<br/>
my handcarved stamps.  I have two boxes ready to plant in the mid-Missouri<br/>
area - now I'm just waiting for a chance to go out and park them in the<br/>
woods.  I'm delighted to see more letterboxing action in Missouri!!<br/>

&gt; Hi All,<br/>
&gt; I'm Malinda (waves). I found about letterboxing from the Carving Consortium<br/>
&gt; Forum.  I guess I did it backwards, sort of.  I do mail art, artistamps,<br/>
&gt; artist trading cards and have started carving stamps recently, I've done 4<br/>
&gt; so far.  <br/>
