                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Heather and anyone else "listening" . I got out my list and here <br/>
goes I think the confusion lies in the fact that I also planted <br/>
hitchhikers and now they have wandered further afield. Check the <br/>
little thumb icon to get the hitch hiker list. I also have  2 private <br/>
boxes planted at the elementary schools and when I get a chance share <br/>
the avocation with a class or teacher. Vinton school used theres as <br/>
an after Mastery testing diversion, now we have several avid boxers <br/>
who got into it from that occasion. I have not posted the clues <br/>
because I didn't feel schools  were a "public " park, yet still a <br/>
great place and what better lesson than direction following. S.E. <br/>
school is next to get their very own box. Now I drive around with a <br/>
bag of ready to plant boxes in my car waiting for time when I can hit <br/>
the trail. This weekend should be productive. I also have a private <br/>
box at our 4-H center in Vernon. I planted one in Lebanon ,two in <br/>
Kentucky plus a Kentucky hitch hiker.<br/>
   Keep your  eye open for Chick in a Nest, Froggy went a Courtin' , <br/>
Black Fish, Partridge in  a Pear Tree , and more.  Are We Having Fun <br/>
Yet?    Carol , Leader of the Pack<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Carol, for the great list of Mansfield letterboxes, and <br/>
especially for the continuing creative flow! If you haven't been out <br/>
to search for some Cocka-doodle-moo letterboxes, folks, you're in for <br/>
a real treat. I'd also like to mention that Carol has a "mystery" box <br/>
under the "?" on the Connecticut map.<br/>
<br/>
Heather, it's true the maps aren't perfect. In the older days when <br/>
TomC was doing southern new england he was much more accurate with <br/>
the dots than I have been. I've got to get a nice paper map of the <br/>
Storrs area to help me locate Carol's ongoing efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had a wonderful holiday,<br/>
