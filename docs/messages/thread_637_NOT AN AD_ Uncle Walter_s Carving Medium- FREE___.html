                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all... Hoggie here. Got my Rubberstampmadness a few days ago and found an <br/>
ad announcing the 2nd Annual Uncle Walter's Stamp Carving Contest, beginning <br/>
Sept 1 and running through Oct 31. You can get a FREE 2.3" X 2.5" X .75" <br/>
Uncle Walter's Carving block by sending $1 for shipping and handling to:<br/>
<br/>
Faith Company<br/>
P.O. Box 35<br/>
Amesbury, Mass. 01913<br/>
<br/>
I ordered one last year, still have it. Never got around to carving my stamp. <br/>
 But this will give you an opportunity to give it a try for free, to see if <br/>
you like it. The rules of the contest are included with the block. As I <br/>
remember, you don't have to send in your STAMP, only the image that you <br/>
create with it.<br/>
