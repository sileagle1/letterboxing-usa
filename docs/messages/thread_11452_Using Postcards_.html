<br/>
My daughter's friend told us about putting postcards in a letterbox <br/>
she placed with a camp group and how pleased they were to receive a <br/>
card from a finder. We haven't found a box with cards in it yet - but <br/>
then we're still newbies.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know that I would get organized enough to do this, tho seems <br/>
nice. (I have trouble remembering all the basics -- more than once <br/>
we've gone back to check on a box because I forgot to stamp the image <br/>
into our log book as placed box!)<br/>

<br/>
Out of *almost* 400 boxes that I've found, only two have had <br/>
postcards.  Actually, one was part of a series and if I recall <br/>
correctly, each of the boxes in the series had postcards, but I only <br/>
took a postcard from one of them to send to the person who placed the <br/>
box.  Three from the same person seems a bit excessive!  Who wants <br/>
THAT much mail from me?  =)  But one from that series, and one from <br/>
another letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I assume they are for sending a note back to the person who placed<br/>
&gt; the box?<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  I also tend to stamp my signature stamp as a "signature", along <br/>
with whatever other stamps I've carved but haven't hidden yet to <br/>
color up the postcard a bit.  =)<br/>
<br/>
It's not very common, but it does happen occasionally.<br/>

<br/>
I leave postcards in my boxes and with my hitch hikers. I love being <br/>
surprised by a little something unexpected in my mailbox, especially when <br/>
people include an impression of their stamp and a note about the box or <br/>
HH's condition and their adventure finding it. I've received maybe 15 <br/>
postcards back over the past nine months.<br/>
<br/>
As far as organization, I buy the pre-stamped postcards from the post <br/>
office since that's easiest for me. I address them to myself and stamp the <br/>
box/HH stamp on the front, to the left of my address. On the back I write a <br/>
short request for box finders to update me on the box condition and share <br/>
their personal stamp if they so desire.<br/>
<br/>
I include the postcards in the same bag as the logbook, and usually leave <br/>
5-10 of them depending on how much room is available. If I get an email <br/>
from someone who's found one of my HHs (I include an email address in the <br/>
logbook for updates as well), I'll write back to see if the HH needs <br/>
postcard replenishment.<br/>
<br/>
I can't remember ever finding a box with postcards in it, but many have <br/>
email addresses for updates so I write the address in my logbook and send <br/>
off an email after I get home. I love hearing from people who have found my <br/>
boxes, so I try to be diligent about doing the same for those whose boxes I <br/>
find. If you think the postcards will add more complexity to your planting <br/>
process, try including your email address to the logbook for now and see <br/>
how that works for you.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of what you do, have fun!<br/>

I don't leave postcards, but I do include take-home pieces of paper with a link<br/>
to the letterboxing website and my contact information.<br/>

I love the idea of postcards with a HH. It really wouold be nice to keep <br/>
tabs on a HH...lets face it some of these HH and boxes are real labors of <br/>
love!<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to start doing that with my HH!<br/>
