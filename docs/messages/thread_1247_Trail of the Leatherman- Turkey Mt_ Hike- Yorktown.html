                    <div class="plaintext-content">In the late 1800s there lived a mysterious hermit  known as the Leatherman.  <br/>
He wandered through Westchester and Putnam Counties and journied to <br/>
Connecticut as well.  Living in caves and clothed in cured leather many <br/>
wondered where he came from .  Rumors abounded of a wealthy start, a broken <br/>
romance and shattered dreams.  He was a survivor of the blizzard of 1888 and <br/>
becme such a local fixture and legend that he was spared from the vagrancy <br/>
laws of the times.  Even today intrepid exploreres may walk his old trails...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Turkey Mt. Park is located on Rte.118 approximately 1 mile north of Rte.129 <br/>
in Yorktown Heights, NY<br/>
<br/>
Walk in the steps of the leatherman:<br/>
Stop at the parking lot and look around,<br/>
Many footsteps do abound.<br/>
Follow the trail marked the color of snow.<br/>
This is the way the Leatherman would go.<br/>
Pass an outdoor class on your left,<br/>
Cross a brook, it may not be swift.<br/>
Pass the yellow trail and start up the hill,<br/>
Take a rest and not a spill!<br/>
Look for a rock wall and keep going up-<br/>
Take a drink from a bottle or a cup!<br/>
Look for a very long step made out of a log-(it gets really steep here),<br/>
43 paces up stop and go off to the right,<br/>
a big flat rock should be in sight.<br/>
Stand on this rock and take in the view-<br/>
You may see our house and we may see you!  (only in the winter)<br/>
Get back on the trail look for arrows on the rocks,<br/>
Keep on going to the concrete block- the one without the spikes..yikes!<br/>
Standing here go toward the Hudson River-that would be west,<br/>
16 paces down the rock and arrest (stop).<br/>
A path on the left you will see,<br/>
Watch your head..stop, look and see!  (This is a short distance)<br/>
Aim toward the  Croton Dam and head down a big rock,<br/>
If wearing high heels go in your sock!! (steep)<br/>
Sit on the biggest rock that is covered with lichens- It's pointing towards <br/>
the dam as well-<br/>
Your sitting on the box-<br/>
Isn't that swell!<br/>
Please reach under and use care-<br/>
a little snake may live there!<br/>
Replace the rock covering the box-Leave your stamp in the book and thanks a <br/>
lot!<br/>
The leatherman enjoyed this view-we're glad that we could share it with you!<br/>
