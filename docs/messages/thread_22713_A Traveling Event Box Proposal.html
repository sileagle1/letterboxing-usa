<br/>
Based on the calendar of events, fall and gathers seem to go hand in <br/>
hand! One of the biggest highlights of every gather is the wide range <br/>
of traveling event stamps that appears on the event tables. Event <br/>
stamps come with a historysome have been around for years! They <br/>
showcase some of the best carving to be seen within the LBNA. Other <br/>
event boxes contain ingeniously crafted logbooksinspiration for us <br/>
all. Some event boxes are beautiful, some are clever, some are funny. <br/>
There are traveling event boxes that feature multiple stamps carved <br/>
by many contributors. The variety is astonishing! <br/>
<br/>
But how do we get the stamps to the gathers? So far, it seems as <br/>
though an event organizer's only option is to put up a plea and hope <br/>
for the best. Wouldn't it be nice if you could sign up for event <br/>
boxes months in advance? Wouldn't it be nice if you, as a box <br/>
creator, received postcard updates of the places your box has <br/>
been...stamped with the event stamp? Wouldn't it be nice to know the <br/>
history of event boxes that have been around awhile? Wouldn't it be <br/>
nice if there were enough "Spooky" event boxes for every October <br/>
gather?<br/>
<br/>
I'm proposing a new talklist to help organize the traveling event box <br/>
process. With everything that event organizers have to take care of, <br/>
pulling together all the details of a good gather, this group can <br/>
offer a little help. Let's pull together the most comprehensive list <br/>
of traveling event boxes we can. I am offering to help manage the <br/>
travel schedule of "legendary" event boxes as well as brand new <br/>
offerings. I'll happily work with box creators to make sure their <br/>
special requirements are carried out. I'll be soliciting the creation <br/>
of new, top-quality event boxes from letterboxers across the <br/>
country.  I'll be working with a group of letterboxing associates to <br/>
create reviews of traveling event boxesdescriptive and entertaining. <br/>
I'd be happy to help coordinate the travel schedule of boxes so they <br/>
rotate through the regions on a regular basis. I'd love to see boxing <br/>
bundles created for seasonal and themed eventsfall gathers, winter <br/>
gathers, mystery gathers, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I realize not every traveling event box creator will want to hand <br/>
over the reigns of their boxes, and that's fine. I don't want to step <br/>
on any toes here. All I'm offering to do is help organize things. <br/>

event stamps has blossomed to be an unorganized, unmanaged thing.  <br/>
Traveling event stamps are nice in the respect that they allow people <br/>
to see the carvings from letterboxers in other parts of the country - <br/>
people with whom they are unlikely to come in contact or attend an <br/>
event.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure the work that you and the group put into this will make it <br/>
easier for event organizers to be aware of and obtain yet more stamps <br/>
to set around on the tables at their events.<br/>
<br/>
SIDEBAR:  What ever happened to having an event and soliciting box <br/>
contributions from boxers across the country specific to the theme of <br/>
your event and then PLANTING them at the event site, rather than <br/>
having a table full of event stamps?<br/>
<br/>
As much as I can see the perceived need for this, there is a part of <br/>
me that enjoyed the unorganized hodge-podge of event stamps floating <br/>
around throughout the country -- not knowing what was even out there <br/>
and which stamps may make surprise appearances at the next event I <br/>
attend (due to the diligence of a conscientious and thorough event <br/>
planner).  As an event organizer, it has been a wonderful surprise <br/>
for me when I have announced events and people have e-mailed to offer <br/>
their traveling stamps or pass along event stamps in their possession <br/>
from a previous gathering.  It has also been an enjoyable part of the <br/>
organization for me to "track down" certain event stamps, sifting <br/>
through event reports and following the trail certain stamps made in <br/>
the event circuit.  I enjoyed the interaction and the networking <br/>
among boxers that this involved.  I recall one instance where a <br/>
coveted traveling stamp showed up in my mailbox without a return <br/>
address two days before an event I was hosting.  It was a nice <br/>
surprise and I have no idea who sent it to me, which only served to <br/>
enhance the legend surrounding this stamp.<br/>
<br/>
While having a group to manage this will no doubt make it easier and <br/>
more organized, it also takes away some of the mystery and the <br/>
surprise of traveling event stamps.  I would suspect there will be <br/>
those who choose NOT to list their event stamps, rather continue to <br/>
rely on word-of-mouth and person-to-person contact -- and these will <br/>
be the desirable stamps to nab for an event -- the ones that had to <br/>
be tracked down, chased after and bargained for.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents...<br/>

<br/>
I think I might know of that special box that you write...it was very special. I moved me to <br/>
write on the biglist for the first time in years. I agree that those things need to flow in <br/>
different channels that the list for traveling boxes, but the list is still a pretty good idea. A <br/>
heck of a big undertaking. <br/>
<br/>
The unexpected is the beauty of traveling boxes, but losing track of one kind of stinks. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the traveling event boxes of lore can be grandfathered out of the list and all <br/>
subsequent boxes intended toward secrecy CLEARLY stated from here on out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the memories,<br/>

Hello, Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Based on the calendar of events, fall and gathers seem to go hand in <br/>
hand! One of the biggest highlights of every gather is the wide range <br/>
of traveling event stamps that appears on the event tables. Event <br/>
stamps come with a historysome have been around for years! They <br/>
showcase some of the best carving to be seen within the LBNA. Other <br/>
event boxes contain ingeniously crafted logbooksinspiration for us <br/>
all. Some event boxes are beautiful, some are clever, some are funny. <br/>
There are traveling event boxes that feature multiple stamps carved <br/>
by many contributors. The variety is astonishing! <br/>
<br/>
But how do we get the stamps to the gathers? So far, it seems as <br/>
though an event organizer's only option is to put up a plea and hope <br/>
for the best. Wouldn't it be nice if you could sign up for event <br/>
boxes months in advance? Wouldn't it be nice if you, as a box <br/>
creator, received postcard updates of the places your box has <br/>
been...stamped with the event stamp? Wouldn't it be nice to know the <br/>
history of event boxes that have been around awhile? Wouldn't it be <br/>
nice if there were enough "Spooky" event boxes for every October <br/>
gather?<br/>
<br/>
I'm proposing a new talklist to help organize the traveling event box <br/>
process. With everything that event organizers have to take care of, <br/>
pulling together all the details of a good gather, this group can <br/>
offer a little help. Let's pull together the most comprehensive list <br/>
of traveling event boxes we can. I am offering to help manage the <br/>
travel schedule of "legendary" event boxes as well as brand new <br/>
offerings. I'll happily work with box creators to make sure their <br/>
special requirements are carried out. I'll be soliciting the creation <br/>
of new, top-quality event boxes from letterboxers across the <br/>
country.  I'll be working with a group of letterboxing associates to <br/>
create reviews of traveling event boxesdescriptive and entertaining. <br/>
I'd be happy to help coordinate the travel schedule of boxes so they <br/>
rotate through the regions on a regular basis. I'd love to see boxing <br/>
bundles created for seasonal and themed eventsfall gathers, winter <br/>
gathers, mystery gathers, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I realize not every traveling event box creator will want to hand <br/>
over the reigns of their boxes, and that's fine. I don't want to step <br/>
on any toes here. All I'm offering to do is help organize things. <br/>
<br/>
If you are a box creator, an event organizer, or an interested <br/>
letterboxing friend, please come over and join the LBNA_EventBoxes <br/>
Yahoo group.<br/>
