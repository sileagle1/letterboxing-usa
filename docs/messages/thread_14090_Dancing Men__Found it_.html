So happy to be able to add a few more "graduates" to the "Detective <br/>
School" list! A week or so ago, Butterfly and Bluebird finally "made <br/>
the grade", and now Mike and Christine! With so many mystery boxes <br/>
out there now, some seem to be worth the time and effort involved in <br/>
figuring them out, and others just don't! We were afraid ours might <br/>
turn out to fall into that latter category, but it's been quite a <br/>
thrill to see people getting  excited about solving "Pete's Puzzle", <br/>
and writing to tell us about their adventures, too! <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

P.S. Team Green Dragon, hope you guys are going to get there soon !<br/>

What a thrill it will be for us to find it since<br/>
we have driven all over the state of RI and checking<br/>
out many interesting (but wrong places). This<br/>
box is kind of an obsession for us and we will probably<br/>
buy a bottle of Dom Perignon when we do find it! LOL<br/>

these elusive, mysterious Dancing Men shouldn't be too <br/>
difficult...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with it!  I hope one day to be in the area &amp; ABLE to solve <br/>
this mystery too!  I know how that living/breathing mystery <br/>
letterbox clues go--I had been pondering a couple of them for <br/>
several months until one evening when I couldn't sleep, one of the <br/>
answers finally popped into my head!  Like a 'oh, duh' moment.  <br/>
Then, of course, it took a few more months to actually get to its <br/>
hiding spot.  I even have about half a dozen other mystery boxes <br/>
that I've solved but geographically just haven't been able to get to <br/>
yet.  Hopefully, we'll get some free 'roaming' time in the future...<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
