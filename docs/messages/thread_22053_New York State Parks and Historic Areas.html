                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry if this is old news, but I learned today that New York State Park and Historic <br/>
Areas have new permits for geocaches.  Please note that these are state parks, not the <br/>
Adirondack Park and Catskills which are overseen by other agencies.<br/>
<br/>
Why does this concern letterboxers?  Well, we have boxes out there in the state park <br/>
woods too.  If geocachers need a permit, it is very likely a letterboxer might too.  Its <br/>
really the same to park administrators right...its still a box in the woods that someone <br/>
outside the park is putting there and telling people to go find it.<br/>
<br/>
Do what you want with this info, just thought you all might like to know.  Always the <br/>
chance they find the box and decomission it, citing it doesn't have a permit.  I know it <br/>
isn't good new to me either, but better to be informed of it than not.<br/>
