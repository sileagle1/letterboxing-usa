I understand from year-round Floridians that due to the breezes, the Gulf <br/>
Coast _is_ considerably cooler in the summer than elsewhere in the state.  I <br/>
congratulate those who had the knowledge and/or foresight to choose the west <br/>
coast.  That said, I am glad we chose DeLand, as it has considerably less <br/>
concrete and traffic - and more trees - than St. Pete.<br/>
<br/>
I lived in Central Florida through four summers, and if it weren't for the <br/>
gator-free pool at DeLeon Springs, I think I would have committed suicide.  <br/>
I'm from Wisconsin; I don't like to be hot (our 1924 stucco house is not <br/>
air-conditioned, nor, until recently, were any of our cars; we don't have a <br/>
garage or even a carport for shelter from the rays).  My husband is <br/>
originally from St. Pete; he doesn't like to be cold.  Therefore, the <br/>
snowbird life.  What we save on heating up here and air conditioning down <br/>
there pretty much paid for the mountain house.<br/>
<br/>
We'd be happy to host a gathering in DeLand in January - we entertain a lot <br/>
anyway.  One of the old-timers told us that during Prohibition, ours was THE <br/>
party place.  You'll see why if you come visit.<br/>
<br/>
There are currently 9 boxes in and around DeLand; when I get back there will <br/>
probably be that many more...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am one of the Florida letterboxers and I think the idea of Deland <br/>
is great.  However, I also like to be by the beaches occasionally <br/>
(since I'm a working person I really don't get there much - only 25 <br/>
miles away).  Fort DeSoto is a nice place - just alot of traffic <br/>
getting there.  The idea of Orlando doesn't appeal to me at all - too <br/>
many people and way too much traffic.  I live north of Tampa so any <br/>
of the places are accessible to me.  My favorite times to take time <br/>
off from work &amp; enjoy the weather is February or October, but anytime <br/>
would work for me.<br/>
<br/>
Would love to have a gathering.  My daughter-in-law in Cocoa would <br/>
also be close to Deland.  We often letterbox together.<br/>
