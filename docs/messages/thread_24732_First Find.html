                    <div class="plaintext-content">My first letterbox found (Finch Arboretum) was on 8/31/2002 at Finch <br/>
Arboretum in Spokane, WA with Baby Bear.  It is still listed on LBNA <br/>
but not sure if it is still there.  It's funny that my first box was <br/>
so far from where I live (TX), but at the time there just weren't <br/>
many boxes in my state, so I found my first during a vacation.  I <br/>
did not have anything with me to stamp with, not being sure about <br/>
this new hobby, but luckily the box included stamped postcards, so I <br/>
was able to retrieve a stamp image of my first.  As luck would have <br/>
it, there was a Hitchhiker, too.  It was Hitch, a profile of Alfred <br/>
Hitchcock carved by Amanda From Seattle.  I followed the directions <br/>
and took the hitchhiker with me back to TX, but then realized I had <br/>
no letterbox to place it in.  This forced me to place my first box <br/>
with it included, and I have enjoyed placing boxes ever since.  I am <br/>
convinced that if we had not actually found the box that day, I  <br/>
would not have become interested in letterboxing.  That is why I <br/>
like to spread my boxes as far and wide as possible so more people <br/>
can experience the fun of finding their first box and hopefully get <br/>
hooked like we did.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who place boxes!  It really is the best way to <br/>
spread the joy of letterboxing.<br/>

found Silver Eagle's SugarLand Microbox.  We were so excited to find <br/>

I recently introduced a couple of friends to letterboxing and was happy <br/>
to hear that they had recently found SugarLand Microbox too.  Glad the <br/>
box is still in place after all this time. <br/>

were early for a surprise birthday party in Alameda, so we decided to <br/>
take a walk and see if we could locate a box or two before going to <br/>
the party.  We found 3 and Grinch ruined her stockings since her new <br/>
shoes hurt and the trail (after she removed her shoes) was covered in <br/>
gravel.  Bandaids and good walking shoes have been staples while we <br/>
searched for many boxes on numerous trails since then.  Thanks to all <br/>
of you who have placed boxes for many of us to find.<br/>

Thanks, Mommo, my biggest fan! :) <br/>
<br/>
[shameless plug on] For those inclined to mystery boxes, we just <br/>
planted "37" this month, a box that is a bit of an experiment for us. <br/>
Happy to say it's had its first finder in The Royal Fish, who's also <br/>
now a contributor to the box.[shameless plug off]<br/>
<br/>
And may I return the compliment to Mommo? Mommo's boxes are not too <br/>
shabby either, suffused with much good humor in the clues and very <br/>
clever carves.<br/>
<br/>
My first find was McKeldin Library, an early library box by the <br/>
Mobots, who I believe are at least semi-retired from boxing at this <br/>
point. Took me a couple of tries to find it, but I'll never forget <br/>
the thrill of reaching blindly into the place indicated, and actually <br/>
coming up with the thing. Who'd have thought?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mine was "We Will Never Forget", a 9-11 homage box, in May 2007.  <br/>
Planted in Eagle Rock Park, West Orange, NJ.  It was very close to <br/>
where I parked, took me literally 2 minutes to locate it.  There was no <br/>
logbook, just a few sodden index cards and scraps of paper.  I had <br/>
some "first aid" supplies with me, so I put in a new logbook in a new <br/>
double lock freezer bag to keep it dry.  A few weeks later I replaced <br/>
the box container itself, since the original was a quart chinese food <br/>
container.  <br/>
<br/>
I found my second box that same day, in the same park about 30 minutes <br/>
later.  This one was "Gabriella's Flag" and required a bit of a hike.  <br/>
I had gone after this one a few weeks earlier, but took a wrong turn on <br/>
the trail and came up empty.  This time I had gone the right way, and <br/>
went right to it.  First time I tried for this one it was in April and <br/>
the trees were bare.  Just a few weeks later all the trees had leaves; <br/>
what a big difference in the look of the landscape!<br/>
