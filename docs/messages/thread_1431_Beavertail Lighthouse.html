                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Beavertail Lighthouse letterbox is certainly placed at one of the <br/>
prettiest sites on Jamestown, and seems to attract it's share of <br/>
hitch hiker (or Travelling) letterboxes. I recently found the "Home <br/>
Is Where the Heart Is" box tucked in with the Lighthouse box. This <br/>
got me thinking of the first box I found there, the "tall Ships" box, <br/>
which I found on July 4. I then gave it to a friend who planted it in <br/>
Newport, where it was found by a letterboxer known as "Christofur". <br/>
Since getting a E-mail from him I've heard nothing else more about <br/>
this box. It would be a shame if the wind has been taken out of it's <br/>
sails. It's one of the nicest hand carved stamps that I've found made <br/>
by the Drewclan. Has any one found or heard anything about this box <br/>
lately? It would be nice to get an update if anyone has any info on <br/>
it. Also, the "Start Trek Voyager" traveller has been taken to <br/>
Virginia and given to friends to place down there after I found it at <br/>
Parker Woodlands. I highly recommend the Parker Woodlands hike to <br/>
search for those boxes. Job well done by those who placed them there. <br/>
I will soon be placing the "Home Is Where the Heart Is" box, probably <br/>
somewhere along the Narragansett Trail near the Casino which is the <br/>
area I'm exploring now. Hope to see some of you out there.<br/>

did come out ship-shape! We haven't heard of it's whereabouts either, <br/>
but hope it has fair winds and following seas.<br/>
