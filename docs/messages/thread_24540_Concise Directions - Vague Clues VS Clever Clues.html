                    <div class="plaintext-content">Getting back to the original post that started all this discussion, I <br/>
would have to say I agree with some of these statements about some <br/>
clues.  There have been times that I have been so confused by vague <br/>
clues that I was not able to enjoy the place at all since I was too <br/>
busy trying to find the correct "big rock" or "big tree".  Another <br/>
even bigger consequence is that vague clues promote random searching <br/>
behind many trees and rocks, disturbing the land and thus giving <br/>
letterboxing a bad name and possibly causing it to be banned in that <br/>
park.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I know people are going to say "not all boxes are for everyone <br/>
and if you don't like the clues, don't go for the box", which is <br/>
true, but the problem is that some clues are not known to be vague <br/>
until you get there and have already hiked quite a ways.  At that <br/>
point it is hard to give up on the box without doing a wide search in <br/>
the hopes of getting lucky (I don't condone this, but understand it).<br/>
<br/>
There is a fine line between vague clues and clever clues, but I <br/>
think a few things can help.  Try to put distances (steps or yards) <br/>
between landmarks in the clues so that when you pass a "big rock" <br/>
or "big tree" before you have gone the correct distance you will <br/>
ignore it.  I think distance is better than time (e.g. walk for 5 <br/>
minutes) since everyone walks at different speeds.  Also, pick <br/>
landmarks that are obvious once you see them.  For example, a "big <br/>
tree" is not as descriptive as a "a large ent with its arm across the <br/>
trail".<br/>
<br/>
Please don't think I am advocating that every letterbox should have <br/>
exact clues that take you right to the box.  Some of my favorite <br/>
letterboxes had frustrating clues that I just about gave up on.  But <br/>
those clues were CLEVER, not vague, and they made me think harder <br/>
instead of just searching randomly.  I think with a little more <br/>
thought, all clues can be fun.<br/>

&gt; Do any of you letterbox folks feel this way at times -- I know we <br/>
do --- I'd<br/>
&gt; like to ask that when you hide a letterbox, your clues on finding <br/>
it are as<br/>
&gt; clear as possible.  YOU know where it is; WE don't.  When you say <br/>
its the<br/>
&gt; tree that looks like an aardvark 50 paces to the left of the big <br/>
rock ----<br/>
&gt; well maybe the tree doesn't look like an aardvark to me  and in a <br/>
woodsy<br/>
&gt; setting there are 500000000000 rocks.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I cant tell you how many we have gone to find following clues <br/>
like   walk up<br/>
&gt; the road til you find a big tree with a branch that hangs low.<br/>
&gt; In nature preserves and parks there are a ton of trees with <br/>
branches that<br/>
&gt; hang low.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Also, if you plant a box in the spring be aware that by august the <br/>
weeds and<br/>
&gt; vines will grow and make it more difficult to find ---- if not <br/>
impossible if<br/>
&gt; you have to cut thru vines and poison ivy etc to get to it,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Remember too that naturally occurring landmarks like trees or <br/>
stumps or<br/>
&gt; whatever can be cut down or moved or blown over in storms ----- the <br/>
tree or<br/>
&gt; log that may be lying across the stream in Nov may no longer be <br/>
there next<br/>
&gt; April or May. The tree that looked like an aardvark may have blown <br/>
over and<br/>
&gt; now looks like a dead hippo on the ground.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We really enjoy taking a nice sunny Saturday afternoon to get out <br/>
and search<br/>
&gt; for these but many times our adventurous outing just turns to <br/>
frustration<br/>
&gt; because someone has written  "walk down the road til you find a <br/>
stone wall<br/>
&gt; and the box is on the left of the stone wall"  when it is actually <br/>
on the<br/>
&gt; right.  Across from the big white and yellow house -- when it <br/>
actuality it<br/>
&gt; was not across  from it but a half mile down the road and around a <br/>
corner.  <br/>
&gt;  (Two clues from a recent letter box with details changed a bit to <br/>
not point<br/>
&gt; to anyone specific)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I know the fun of letterboxing is the hunt  but when it gets <br/>
frustrating<br/>
&gt; because the clues are vague or just wrong it really does tend to <br/>
put a<br/>
&gt; damper on the fun.<br/>

***************************************************<br/>
<br/>
This is most definitely true.  I think some folks opt to write "clever"<br/>
clues because they can't write clear clues or don't want to take the time to<br/>
write them clearly, or try to write clues from memory once they get home,<br/>
and what they wind up with is not clever at all, but horribly vague.<br/>
<br/>
The beauty of a good clever clue is that once it is figured out, it is so<br/>
painstakingly accurate that the finder feels as thought they suddenly opened<br/>
their eyes and the directions were as clear as day.<br/>
