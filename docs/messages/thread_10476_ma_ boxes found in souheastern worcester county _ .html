<br/>
Rustypuff and I spent our Sunday in southeastern Worcester County, <br/>
Massachusetts.  Despite the heavy snow cover in the area, we were <br/>
able to find the following boxes.  All were in place, dry, and <br/>
intact:  <br/>
<br/>
Marathon, Peace on Earth, Walk-up Reservation, Tangled Woods, and <br/>
Angel's Lookout at Peppercorn Point<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid I put a small hole in this last box while prying it out of <br/>
its snow- and ice-bound hiding place.  The contents are well-<br/>
protected with ziplock bags, though, so it should be fine.  Point of <br/>
education: Rubbermaid containers become brittle in the cold!<br/>
<br/>
We dropped in on Warrior Woman at her home and she treated us to much-<br/>
appreciated mugs of hot chocolate.  We had a pleasant chat about <br/>
letterboxing, copyright law, and the consequences of thwarting <br/>
evolution, before returning to the chilly outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
In hitchhiker news, I came across the New Year's Dragon 2003 <br/>
hitchhiker at one of my own boxes on Saturday, and, after stamping <br/>
in, left it where it was.  Also, Rustypuff and I dropped off the <br/>
Woody hitchhiker at some point over the weekend.<br/>
