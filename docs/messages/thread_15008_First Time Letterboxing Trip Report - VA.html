Per Mary's suggestion - we didn't try Folly Lick boxes. <br/>
<br/>
My friends and I found all Dead Authors (Vienna, VA) 5 boxes... We<br/>
really enjoyed it. Took us 2.5hrs w/o a compass (I forgot it at<br/>
home)... Box # 2 was hard to find - our ears couldn't hear the water.<br/>
Had to back track a few times... We noticed someone else was looking<br/>
for the boxes that same day and around the same time. We were just<br/>
prob. 5-10mins behind them.<br/>
<br/>
Be's Search for the Mushroom Kingdom - we found this box also.<br/>
Princess Peach stamp is still there :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Mary for the great start! What a great start - 6 boxes found! <br/>

&gt; Hi Niki-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You absolutely, positively, do NOT want to start your letterboxing <br/>
&gt; adventures with the Folly Lick boxes.  It will swear you off of <br/>
&gt; letterboxing forever and perhaps have you swearing at Rich for a long <br/>
&gt; time.  See my post #26465 for a full report on our misadventures with <br/>
&gt; these boxes and on our luck with Rich's other boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd recommend coming over to Vienna.  BeMa and I, the principle <br/>
&gt; planters in Vienna, plant easier boxes.  The parks we've planted in <br/>
&gt; are safe if you are alone.  (Rich's are too).  I've found just about <br/>
&gt; all the boxes in NoVa so if you want to know the difficulty of any <br/>
&gt; particular box, contact me off list:  daughteroftheolddominion at <br/>
&gt; yahoo.com.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's great to see a new boxer in NoVa. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey all,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just join the group and want to say hello. I'm new to letterboxing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but have read so much and i'm really excited to begin. Pending on<br/>
&gt; &gt; weather, I hope to find my first box on Saturday. I am going to try<br/>
&gt; &gt; Folly Lick Stream Valley Park letterboxes (2)... <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Any place recommendation for a newbie in NOVA.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>
