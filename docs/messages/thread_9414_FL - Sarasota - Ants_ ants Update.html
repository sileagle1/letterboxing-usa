worried about planting a letterbox in an ant colony.  I drove out <br/>
and moved it.  Here are the updated directions.<br/>
<br/>
To the right of the ant castle tree are two clumps of thick gray <br/>
vines.  Your goal is in the second vine group, about 10 feet <br/>
northwest of the ant tree, hidden under leaves.<br/>
<br/>
I'll rewrite the whole clues and repost them in final after the <br/>
Doubtful Guests gang tries them out tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving<br/>
I hear ants have a lot of protein.<br/>

&gt; Webmaster - Please do not post these directions yet.  They are <br/>
still <br/>
&gt; a draft but I'm posting them just in case for Thanksgiving holiday <br/>
&gt; boxers.  I have a website for my clues and a webmaster for that.  <br/>
&gt; Knights of Columbo I hope will post the clue there later and post <br/>
&gt; here the link for you.<br/>

&gt; DRAFT of new Letterbox<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ant Castle Tree<br/>
&gt; Placed by The Doubtful Guests<br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving, 2002<br/>
&gt; Sarasota County<br/>
&gt; Sarasota, Florida<br/>
&gt; hand made stamp<br/>
&gt; dogs on leash ok<br/>
&gt; easy 10 minute walk<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This end of Sarasota Bay was once a dumping ground.  Now flora and <br/>
&gt; fauna have been restored with mangroves, small tidal streams, <br/>
ponds <br/>
&gt; and a boardwalk nature walk called the Sarasota Bay Walk.  It is <br/>
&gt; still kinda trashy but we saw a lot of interesting plants and <br/>
&gt; creatures.  It is just before the Mote Marine Aquarium and the <br/>
&gt; Pelican Man Sanctuary.  After you turn off the main road towards <br/>
Mote <br/>
&gt; and Pelican turn immediately right into a small parking lot at the <br/>
&gt; sign for Sarasota Bay Walk.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Examine the map at the entrance to the bay walk.  Your goal is on <br/>
&gt; the "Hill".  Follow the boardwalk past the coca cola pond.  <br/>
&gt; Apparently the color is due to the mangrove's tanic acid.  Turn <br/>
right <br/>
&gt; just before the bay watch over look.  Take the next boardwalk <br/>
left.  <br/>
&gt; It will change from boardwalk to trail.  Look for the prickle <br/>
pillow <br/>
&gt; plants.  Trail changes back to boardwalk.  When the boardwalk ends <br/>
&gt; again, stop.  You should be looking at a double tree that splits <br/>
into <br/>
&gt; many large branches.  Step behind this tree and take a bearing.  <br/>
At <br/>
&gt; 215 degrees is the Ant Castle Tree.  You may have to move further <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; to see it.  It is about 30 steps away though you have to go around <br/>
&gt; some trees to get to it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I was there I saw fine dirt piles at the base because walking <br/>
&gt; all up and down one of the large limbs was a steady stream of <br/>
ants.  <br/>
&gt; You've been warned.  I brushed off a dozen ants after placing the <br/>
&gt; box.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Duck under to the left of the tree.  About one third clockwise <br/>
around <br/>
&gt; the base you will find the box stuck in under some leaves.  Take <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; away from the ants to stamp in.  Please replace the box carefully <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the same place so it doesn't wash away in the rain and cover it <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; leaves so it is not easily seen.  There is something of a path <br/>
&gt; leading to the Ant Castle Tree.  I don't know why.  Perhaps <br/>
someone <br/>
&gt; is studying it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Continuing on the path returns you in a loop.  Afterwards be sure <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; visit the Pelican Man Sanctuary.  There is a letterbox there that <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; hope is restored by now. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you find this letterbox missing or damaged please write <br/>
