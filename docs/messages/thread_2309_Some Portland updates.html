Well, I'm sure the stamp won't mind the company of your letterbox *too* <br/>

Der Mad Stamper is at it again, much to the delight of those of us in<br/>
Portland!!!  I really need to get out and nab some of these boxes.  This<br/>
one has handy clues, so maybe I'll try for it this weekend.  Great job,<br/>
Mitch!!!<br/>

Stamper!!  After all, we can't very well find that stamp of yours as <br/>
long as you keep carrying it around in your pocket ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Now, when you go out to hide yours, you can look for mine while your <br/>
at it! Hey, maybe we can talk Amanda into hiding one while she's up <br/>
there, too.  The only way to slow Der Mad Stamper down is to give him <br/>
lots of letterboxes to LOOK FOR!!!<br/>
