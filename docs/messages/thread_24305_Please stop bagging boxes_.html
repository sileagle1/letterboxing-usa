  Thank you.<br/>

  On a lighter note, I found a group of people examining one of the Biltmore boxes.  I thought I was in for a major exchange, but it turns out that none of them were boxers, although one knew it existed in England and didn't know it had made it across the Atlantic.  A mother and son, who were not "with" the others, were very interested, and on the spot young Thomas got hooked.  I had the materials needed to replace a box I'd been told was MIA (#3 - and it wasn't) I carved him a stamp of his own ("Mad Man"), and gave him a logbook.  He is precisely the right age to hang out with the fiddling Wolf pups - and since he attends Brevard Academy, chances are pretty good he can play an instrument as well.  He found the next two boxes on his own.<br/>
