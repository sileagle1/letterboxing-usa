My uncle once told me that a graveyard is a burial plot directly in the land adjoining a church, and that a cemetery is a burial plot not adjoining the church's building.  It makes sense, but I don't know if it's actually so defined.  English - so glad I don't have to learn it as a second language!<br/>

&gt; My uncle once told me that a graveyard is a burial plot directly in the <br/>
&gt; land adjoining a church, and that a cemetery is a burial plot not adjoining the <br/>
&gt; church's building.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
My dictionary gives them as synonyms.   Neither definition mentions anything <br/>
about a church building.<br/>
<br/>
In the interest of staying on topic:   I guess that means planting a box in <br/>
one is about the same as planting a box in the other.<br/>
