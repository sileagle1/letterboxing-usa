northern Ohio into the encyclopedia and any other information you <br/>
think would be of interest to Ohio Letterboxers.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, if any of the other state groups would like me to share some <br/>
information about how to start an encyclopedia for your state, let me <br/>
know.  It just takes a website with a cgi-bin directory into which <br/>
you can upload a perl script, that and a lot of writing.  <br/>

down a couple of your boxes in the Cleveland area a few weeks ago, <br/>
and also the one in Brighton, MI.  Enjoyed them all very much -- <br/>
especially liked the stamp at Huntington!<br/>
