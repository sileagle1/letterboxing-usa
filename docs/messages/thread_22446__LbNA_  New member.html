There are none listed in Citrus County unless I overlooked them.  There are also several listed in the Tampa area which are all doable for a day trip.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info on the SE US group.  I was going to do a yahoo search later today to see what I could find.  You've saved me some time.    <br/>

Kathy--   Where in Florida are you?   I'm in the Fort Lauderdale area.<br/>
<br/>
There's a yahoo list for the SE US, which is a very friendly group, and <br/>
several of us in Florida are on it.<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-southeast/<br/>
<br/>
If I remember right, the FL state parks allow boxes and geocaches with the <br/>
permission of the park manager, but it's been awhile since I read the <br/>
information, and I can't find the website I used right now, cause the link doesn't work <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have any boxes near you at all?   I agree with whoever said it's a <br/>
good idea to find some before you try planting.<br/>
