Reston, VA. area, and had a great time doing so.<br/>
<br/>
Frying Pan Park; Christmas Tree Graveyard; Furry<br/>
Woodland Creature and Tyson's Witch.  Frying Pan Park<br/>
logbook was wet and we did not have a replacement with<br/>
us.  We enjoyed the stamp.  Seal pups 1&amp;3 managed to<br/>
get their Jr. Ranger Badge at the Kidwell Farm, they<br/>
had a great time.  The Graveyard and Furry Creature<br/>
were in good shape.  I especially liked the Furry<br/>
Creature Stamp done by Firefly.  Tyson's Witch was in<br/>
good shape.  The slope going down to the trail was<br/>
fun, coming back was a different story.  I'm glad we<br/>
put that box as our last find.  I was ready to call it<br/>
quits after climbing back up that slope.<br/>
<br/>
After running around all day Saturday in 70-75 degree<br/>
weather we drove back to Virginia Beach in the snow on<br/>
Sunday, but it was worth it.<br/>
