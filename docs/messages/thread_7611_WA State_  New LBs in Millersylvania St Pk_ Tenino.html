Tenino (10 miles SE of Olympia)<br/>
Thurston County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
Level of difficulty: Mostly level, dirt, gravel or paved trail <br/>
(sections are mucky in rainy season). Clues easy to moderate.<br/>
<br/>
Setting:  Millersylvania is a historic park nestled in broad stands <br/>
of old-growth cedar and fir trees.  Deep Lake, located on the <br/>
property, attracts boaters, swimmers and fishermen.  The state <br/>
capital is a few miles north of the park.  The structures within the <br/>
park were constructed by the Civil Conservation Corps in 1935 as a <br/>
means to employ unemployed people after the stock market crash <br/>
during the Great Depression.  The park originally was <br/>
called 'Miller's Glade' by the Miller family who once<br/>
owned the property.  The family later changed the name <br/>
to 'Millersylvania' meaning 'wooded glade'.  The park's 842 acres <br/>
were homesteaded by Squire Lathum in 1855 before being sold to John <br/>
Miller.  Miller's family gave the property to the state in 1921, <br/>
stipulating that the land must forever be used as a park.<br/>
<br/>
Highlights:   Deep Lake is absolutely breathtaking and very clear.  <br/>
The park is open year round for camping and day use.  Mountain bikes <br/>
are welcome on several trails within the park!  Canoe rental is <br/>
available near the campgrounds but it might be a seasonal thing.  <br/>
You can find more info about this park at:  http://www.parks.wa.gov<br/>
<br/>
Facilities: Restrooms and water fountains located at various points <br/>
along the trail. Bring a picnic lunch and enjoy it after you find <br/>
the 'Pine Tree' or 'Leaf' letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Restrictions: Leash and scoop laws in effect for pets. Bicycles are <br/>
restricted on certain trails.<br/>
<br/>
Length of trek:  Pine Tree letterbox:  about  mile;  Leaf <br/>
Letterbox:  about a 3 mile loop<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take I-5 to Exit #99 or #95, head East and follow signs <br/>
to the park.  Turn onto WA 121 (if you're coming from #99 head <br/>
South; if you're coming from #95 head North).  The entrance to<br/>
the park will be on the West side of the road.  Park in the first <br/>
parking lot you see after the main entrance sign, near the lake and <br/>
the info kiosk.  This is the starting point for both letterbox <br/>
trails.<br/>

We have only been involved in Letterboxing for about 2 months <br/>
now but everytime I see one of your posts I get interested.  We <br/>
have found several of your boxes and have been greatly <br/>
impressed with your clues, choices for locations and even your <br/>
stamps!  <br/>
<br/>
We are hoping very much to meet you someday on the trail.  I <br/>
think that our families would have much in common.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for getting us excited about another hunt in our area!<br/>
