Desperately Seeking Sun event on February 18th, 2006.  People have <br/>
also asked me about recommendations for dinner. I have combined my <br/>
answers by planning "Desperately Seeking Suds"...an after party event.<br/>
<br/>
The After Party is NOT just for those who attend the Desperately <br/>
Seeking Sun daytime event at Highland Forest. I would like to invite <br/>
ANY letterboxer who would like to come and meet your fellow parched <br/>
letterboxers at Kelley's. Can't make the DSS event? Come to the After <br/>
Party! Party starts at 5 pm. <br/>
<br/>
Kelley's is a restaurant/Irish pub located in Syracuse at the corner <br/>
of McDonald and Velasko Roads. It has a full menu for dinner or pub <br/>
fare at reasonable prices. I have reserved the upstairs private room <br/>
with fireplace for us so that people with children can attend, but of <br/>
course the downstairs pub will be open to all and will be hopping <br/>
until the wee hours! They are not charging me anything for the room, <br/>
but I have to give them an approximate head count for dinner. The <br/>
event is listed on Atlasquest so you can get on the headcount for <br/>
dinner....or just surprise us and show up!<br/>
<br/>
Of course there is an event stamp for Desperately Seeking Suds! The <br/>
event stamp has it's own set of clues, which will be given out by me <br/>
when you arrive at Kelley's. Hope to see you there!<br/>
