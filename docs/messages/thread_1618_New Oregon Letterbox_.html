<br/>
Another letterbox has been placed in Oregon.  This time in the <br/>
coastal hamlet of Lincoln City, Oregon at the Devil's Lake State Park <br/>
Day Use area.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: There are two parts to Devil's Lake State Park and they are in <br/>
separate areas so please follow these directions carefully.  If you <br/>
go to the campground you'll be in a nice area, but you will not find <br/>
the letterbox (which is on another portion of the lake). There are <br/>
lots of State Parks in this area of the Oregon Coast so be aware of <br/>
that and don't just follow any old state park sign willy nilly if <br/>
you're out to find this letterbox. We do have excellent state parks <br/>
here and they are worth going to for their own merits, but at this <br/>
time they don't all have letterboxes to hunt for.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  Go all the way into the town of Lincoln City on Hwy 101 <br/>
from either North or South.  Watch for the Lincoln City Factory <br/>
Stores Mall on the Eastside of the highway.  Go East on E. Devil's <br/>
Lake Road, which is the road that runs along the North Side of the <br/>
Lincoln City Factory Stores.  Head down this road for about a mile, <br/>
then turn left at the Oregon State Park sign.   This is the Devil's <br/>
Lake State Park Day Use area.  <br/>
<br/>
CLUES: Easy<br/>
<br/>
DIFFICULTY:  Distance is easy.  A small incline up a paved trail (not <br/>
very far) then a small decline down a dirt path (not very far).  <br/>
Contact with bushes, so you might want to dress for wet.<br/>
<br/>
DEVIL'S LAKE LETTERBOX<br/>
The parking area goes down toward two boat launches.  From the <br/>
parking lot close to the left hand-side boat dock there is an asphalt <br/>
trail with a post.  Go up that trail beyond the picnic tables.  <br/>
Continue on after the pavement stops.  Go down the small hill and <br/>
turn right at the next set of picnic tables.  Go straight on the path <br/>
through the big trees.  Continue on until you can't go straight <br/>
anymore.  There will be mossy snags right in front of you.  Take a <br/>
right and go 12 steps.  Turn and face right.  Now take 3 steps up off <br/>
the trail.  This mossy snaggy-looking tree surrounded by ferns has <br/>
the Devil's Lake Letterbox within its center.<br/>

<br/>
The weekend was a bit crisp and chilly, however, Barry and I managed <br/>
to get out and plant a letterbox in Salem.  It's based off picture <br/>
clues so it may be a bit tricky :)<br/>
<br/>
It is located in Salem, Oregon in Marion County and it's <br/>
titled "Minto Brown Island" (although it isn't really an island).<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link to the clue:  <br/>

Happy Boxing!<br/>
