find.....Fred, A Rose By Any Other Name is still there, Quilting Bee <br/>
part 2 is still there, but Lion in Wait is missing. Lion will be <br/>
replaced with a new stamp as soon as possible. Thanks very much to <br/>
Cinnaboxer for the report-- I had not been able to check on my Paint <br/>
Creek S.P. boxes for some time and its good to hear they're still <br/>
there! I am also re-motivated to search for Franzsolo's Java and <br/>
Rest Area again-- I have made two special trips to search just for <br/>
them and could't find them either time. I refuse to let them defeat <br/>
me again. Those 2 and Watch House in Franklin County are my biggest <br/>
frustrations so far. Happy Boxing to all, Salamander<br/>
