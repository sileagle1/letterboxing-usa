being MIA so please change its status on letterboxing.org. <br/>
<br/>
Also, please change the status of Box O'Rocks to MIA as well.  I <br/>
plan to replace this book but for now it is out of action. <br/>
<br/>
This box was a bit close to the water so I'm sure the 24+ inches of <br/>
snow enjoyed Sarah's lovely stamp. <br/>
<br/>
Since both of these boxes were very close to streams and rivers, I <br/>
guess this is a lesson learned.  This hobby just gets more and more <br/>
interesting the more I do it. <br/>

Ellanor C.<br/>
&gt; Lawrence Park. BUMMER!  They were doing a lot of tree cutting <br/>
around the<br/>

&gt; Also, has anyone tried the "Turning Over A New Leaf" or "Get in to <br/>

&gt; Oh well... it was a beautiful day to hike.<br/>
