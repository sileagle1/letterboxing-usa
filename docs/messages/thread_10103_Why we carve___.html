                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've received so many fabulous comments from letterboxing friends on our <br/>
handcut stamp art that I wax poetical. Thanks to everyone for your <br/>
encouragement!<br/>
<br/>
Most of my stamps are semi-original art. I haven't had any luck with the <br/>
acetone-transfer method: it always seems too runny or too smudgy or <br/>
not-detailed-enough. So I just draw the images directly onto the erasers with <br/>
marker before cutting.<br/>
<br/>
I like working with the ink and the vinyl, that shift into right brain mode <br/>
where time slows down and spatial relationships clarify. My day to day <br/>
concerns and problems recede to hum along in the background, unnoticed, and <br/>
sometimes even self-solve. It's like hypnosis or meditation, quietly <br/>
restorative, invigorating. Then, on awakening from the reverie, the fun in <br/>
seeing my own work there on paper!<br/>
<br/>
I've been studying drawing at the local art academy for a few years and have <br/>
become very good technically at copying art work and at drawing the usual <br/>
studio stuff (chairs, vases, shoes, my own hand until it cramps). I enjoy it <br/>
very much but haven't yet made the leap to true creativity that makes one an <br/>
"artist." So most of our stuff is copied and modified a bit to suit.<br/>
<br/>
I like to carve in-situ, on the site in the woods or shore where the <br/>
letterbox is going. Sitting on a rock in the spring green at Hartman or on a <br/>
bench with osprey fluttering in Hadlyme...heaven! My son is usually along, <br/>
throwing rocks or playing with the binoculars or gps. He's in his own world <br/>
so doesn't often notice me disappearing into mine. I wish I was good enough <br/>
to draw his face, now, in this last bit of time before he steps out of <br/>
childhood and leaves this person in memory.<br/>
<br/>
As people who have collected our stamp images know, I have the hardest time <br/>
with the lettering. There's something a bit too linear and structured about <br/>
print, and my handwriting isn't very good, and flipping the letters backwards <br/>
seems much harder than the flow of a good picture. I'm signed up this session <br/>
for a calligraphy course, hoping that'll improve my stamps a bit more. I just <br/>
wonder what the instructor will think when I do everything in mirror-image...<br/>
<br/>
So a big part of letterboxing for me is making art. Instead of exhibiting at <br/>
MoMA, I sneak out deep into the woods, listen to the snow falling, and leave <br/>
my work under a rock to wait for you and, hopefully, a happy dance.<br/>

<div>Jay - that was beautiful! Thanks so much for 
sharing your thoughts with us :-) <br/>I only hope to be able to carve as well as 
you some day. I love the stamp you did for the Inn at the Beginning - it is just 
gorgeous. But my favorite is still Jay's Dilemma! (But that may be somewhat due 
to the adrenaline rush at actually finding the dang thing!!)</div>

of boxing I finally got to Connecticut and found Goodspeed and Zoom Zoom<br/>
just so I could see what all the fuss was about! They are the most prized <br/>
stamps in my book.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about wanting to capture the youth of your son in a<br/>
carving -- my son is 12 and is in the midst of Becoming A Man -- having<br/>
to shave (!), voice changing, and buying the next size of shoes every<br/>
other month -- yet, he still likes to sit on my lap and snuggle (although <br/>
he is taller than I am now).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Jay...  wonderfully stated.  There is something so satisfying in <br/>
taking an idea, just a picture in your mind -- sometimes only <br/>
fragments and creating an image on paper (or directly on vinyl) and <br/>
then seeing it literally be born as it is carved.  I find I am <br/>
carving just for the sake of carving lately, without concern whether <br/>
it will even make it into a box in the future or not.<br/>
<br/>
I have to give you credit for doing the drawing right onto the <br/>
eraser...  try as I might I can't get the mirror imaging down.  I'll <br/>
get the whole picture except one thing and it all ends up looking <br/>
backwards (like that one guy's pirate).  I always draw mine on paper <br/>
with pencil and then just use the good ole method of placing it face <br/>
down on the eraser and rubbing it with the back of my fingernail.  If <br/>
the pencil is good and sharp, the detail comes out great.  Despite <br/>
this, letters are still the thorn in my side, and never seem to comes <br/>
out even...  but I guess that is part of the charm of a hand-carved <br/>
stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to making it to CT someday soon to collect a few of <br/>
those coveted stamps myself.  Thank you for sharing this.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; We always do a hapy dance when we find your wonderful carvings!  <br/>
And we've both found hidden talents in ourselves since we started <br/>
letterboxing.  As 2 confirmed non-artists (can't draw a straight line <br/>
with a ruler!),  it's very gratifying muster the courage to try <br/>
something new and see it come out nicely.  Thank you for all your <br/>
wonderful works of art.<br/>
