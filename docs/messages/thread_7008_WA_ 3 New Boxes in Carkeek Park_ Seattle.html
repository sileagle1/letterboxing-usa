Box Name(s): Carkeek Salmon Series<br/>
date placed: August 17, 2002<br/>
location: Carkeek Park<br/>
city: Seattle WA<br/>
county: King<br/>
difficulty: relatively easy clues/hikes (short, some uphill)<br/>
<br/>
The other Carkeek boxes are in a different section of the park. Get those <br/>
first. (You do have the clues, right? If not, go get them, I'll <br/>
wait.....got them now? Good. Go get those first.)<br/>
<br/>
One sidenote before we begin: Bring a light color of ink and a dark color, <br/>
if you prefer, since one of the boxes is a two-color stamp. (Actually, <br/>
there are two stamps, one for the light color, one for the black. A <br/>
highlighter pen is provided in the box as the light color, if all you've <br/>
got is black, but it might run out. Bring a blue one of your own to replace <br/>
it with, and I'll send you a replacement, if the old one was dry.)<br/>
<br/>
 From those boxes, follow the park access road up the right fork. Follow it <br/>
around to the parking lot next to the play area and beach access and park. <br/>
Find the bathrooms. (I don't know why I always start at the bathrooms, but <br/>
I do.)<br/>
<br/>
Behind the bathroom is a set of stone stairs that go up and across a small <br/>
play bridge. Go up and across, then take a left to follow that path that <br/>
goes up the hill and into the shadowy woods.<br/>
<br/>
Go left at the T-junction, down and across what looks like it might be a <br/>
dry creek bed. When you get to a dissecting path with a lookout just ahead, <br/>
take a right onto the gravelly path. Stay on this path, even when you see <br/>
offshoots going left or right.<br/>
<br/>
You'll come to a bunch of stairs. Go up the first set of three, and look to <br/>
your right. There is a small path that seems to lead under a natural "arch" <br/>
of foliage. Go that way about four steps, untill you're right under the <br/>
"arch". The young maple to your left side is the sentinel for the first box <br/>
-- IDA's behind this tree at the roots, covered with sticks and leaves. <br/>
(Ida, by the way, is one native american word for salmon. Literally, Idaho <br/>
means salmon-eaters. How cool is that?)<br/>
<br/>
 From the first box, get back on the path and head up three more sets of <br/>
stairs. The path going uphill will curve slightly left. Stay on the main path.<br/>
<br/>
At another pausing place, the path turns right. Follow it uphill without <br/>
turning for a long way.<br/>
<br/>
At a square, wooden lookout, go straight across without turning. You'll <br/>
come to a wooden rail fence on your left. There will be a path just past a <br/>
tree on your right that allows you to turn right before the fence veers <br/>
uphill. Take the right path that goes downhill.<br/>
<br/>
There may be offshoot trails, but stay on the main one (and at a <br/>
particularly confusing "Y" junction, you can just stay to the right, and <br/>
you'll be fine.) At the bottom of the hill, there is a junction with <br/>
another path. At the giant overturned tree, take the left that goes back <br/>
uphill.<br/>
<br/>
Stay straight at the 3 way, 20 paces or so past the junction. The path will <br/>
abruptly end and turn left. Stop, turn around, and take about three paces <br/>
back the way you came. On your left, there is a small path that goes into a <br/>
little shaded clearing that has two thin, oddly shaped trees growing into a <br/>
"U" shape. On the right, under a piece of plywood and lots of bark and <br/>
sticks, is the King Salmon box.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the trail and follow its abrupt left. It'll go sharply up hill <br/>
and up some stairs, past a huge rock and another overturned tree. At those <br/>
stairs, take a right. It goes around a switchback and up the hill further, <br/>
over an earthen bridge and empties out into the North Meadow. (This is a <br/>
perfect resting place and picnic spot. Grab the lone bench and look out <br/>
over the Olympic Peninsula and dream of paths not yet taken for awhile. <br/>
It'll restore the soul.)<br/>
<br/>
When you're done, go back the way you came. On the side of the earthen <br/>
bridge with the stone embedded in the path, take the path through growth to <br/>
the LEFT. It goes up a small hill into a sun-dappled clearing, roughly 17 <br/>
paces from the trail. At the place where the trail splits in 3, in the <br/>
center is a strange tree that looks like it may be two trees with a gap in <br/>
the center. In the larger of these two trees, in a hollow in the middle, on <br/>
the ground under some bark and sticks, is the Salmon Run Box.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the path and head back down the way you came and be sure to stop <br/>
at some of the lookouts you went past on your way up -- it's gorgeous <br/>
around here.<br/>
