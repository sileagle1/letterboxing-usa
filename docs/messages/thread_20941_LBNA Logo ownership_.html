Hi boxers:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At a recent gathering, a group came to me asking who owns the rights <br/>
to the LBNA logo that we all have seen a million times. This party <br/>
wants to design our own Northeast version of the logo, like many <br/>
other parts of the country currently have done.<br/>
<br/>
They also want to take it one step farther - and this is where it <br/>
might get sticky. This group would like to make and sell T shirts, <br/>
hats, etc with this newly designed LBNA Northeast logo. Again, I <br/>
realize that this is currently being done elsewhere but these boxers <br/>
did not want to infringe on anything that might be copyrighted or <br/>
owned by a certain individual or group.<br/>
<br/>
I emailed Randy, hoping to get an answer but he said ownership of the <br/>
logo is hazy at best and he wasn't sure. He suggested I place a post <br/>
to this talk list as well as emailing the Webmasters at <br/>
letterboxing.org so I've done both.<br/>
<br/>
This question is primarily directed to those of you who might have <br/>
been in on this game since the beginning. I apologize for not <br/>
emailing you all directly, but hoped to target you all in this much <br/>
broader forum.<br/>
<br/>
You may email me directly with your responses.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

Mark,<br/>
<br/>
I was the primary designer for the LbNA logo and, as such, would be <br/>
the person most likely to claim ownership for it.  In reality, <br/>
however, my design was driven by a group effort that occurred on the <br/>
Letterbox USA talk list.  Therefore, I have always considered it to <br/>
be a "by the people, for the people" sort of thing, and have publicly <br/>
stated on more than one occasion that it belongs to the entire LbNA <br/>
community.  I realize this is not a very practical notion from a <br/>
legal standpoint, but I wanted to make sure that localized groups, <br/>
such as the one you have mentioned, would feel free to use it in <br/>
their letterboxing pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
So, as far as I'm concerned, you may feel free to use it... with the <br/>
following caveats:<br/>
<br/>
1)  If you're going to sell things with the logo on them, I feel you <br/>
should be obligated to give the money you make back to the <br/>
letterboxing community. In other words, use it to fund the expenses <br/>
for holding public get-togethers, etc., rather than supporting your <br/>
habits for such luxury items as food and clothing.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Out of respect for the extensive group effort that went into <br/>
designing the logo, I do not feel that you should alter or modify the <br/>
logo in any way.  You should feel free to add other designs around <br/>
it, but I would hope that you would not distort it, recolor it, or <br/>
place other elements inside of it.  The basic shape of the <br/>
characters, and the blue and green color scheme, in my eyes, are <br/>
somewhat sacred.  To interfere with these elements would be <br/>
disrespectful to the original founding members of LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that my opinion is helpful to you, and I hope that you will <br/>
take it to heart.<br/>
<br/>
Cordially,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>

Dear Mr. Mad Stamper,<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to know who was responsible for designing that logo - I <br/>
really like the look of it!  Maybe I'm too "brand" oriented, but it's <br/>
more fun for me when a hobby I participate in has such a professional-<br/>
looking logo and website.  Kind of validates it in some weird way...  <br/>
Anyway, thanks for a job well done!<br/>
<br/>

Mitch - <br/>
   We could not agree more with this!  I'm sure that proceeds could <br/>
certainly be used wisely to better letterboxing for all. Actually, is <br/>
someone still paying for the web space for letterboxing.org? I seem <br/>
to remember talking to someone some time ago that mentioned this. <br/>
<br/>
Is there any need to put some sort of logo disclaimer on <br/>
letterboxing.org? <br/>
