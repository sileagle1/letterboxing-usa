                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sigh. My Forest Hill Park series in Richmond, VA, is driving me <br/>
bonkers! And probably my fellow boxers as well. I'm sorry for the <br/>
frustration of going to this park expecting to find four boxes and <br/>
coming away with maybe one or two because all of these boxes except <br/>
one keep getting snatched.<br/>
<br/>
And it's happened again. Box no. 1, The Sled, is MIA. VA webmanager, <br/>
could you please mark it MIA as of 12/28/02? I'm working on replacing <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I've had a report that box no. 4, The Mountain Bike, is also MIA, but <br/>
haven't been able to verify that.<br/>
<br/>
And could you also mark box no. 3, the Amusement Park, temporarily <br/>
removed for box maintenance as of 12/28/02?<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh. I'm ready to give up on this freakin' park. grumble grumble <br/>
grumble<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, so sorry and I'll replace the missing ones ONE MORE TIME.<br/>
