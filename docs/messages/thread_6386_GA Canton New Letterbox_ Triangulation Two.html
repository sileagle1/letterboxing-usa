<br/>
The large field where the first letterbox was placed is good for yet another box.  Here are the azimuths:<br/>
<br/>
Call it  "Triangulation Two".<br/>
<br/>
Same cautions and suggestions apply. Here are a new set of bearings<br/>
that may be more of a challenge since all of them are in the southern hemisphere.<br/>
<br/>
Toward the east, the peak on the front of Home Depot is 092 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
More toward the south, there are two towers on the horizon that<br/>
    are less than a thumb width apart; azimuth 122 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
A bit more to the south, bearing 161 degrees, is a tower with segments<br/>
    toward the top. The tower is near the main library of the regional libraries.<br/>
    I hope to have some library letterboxes eventually.<br/>
<br/>
There are two water tanks visible as you continue to scan southward.<br/>
    The near tank is at 180 degrees while the far tank on the horizon is at<br/>
    212 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
We hope that you have found this letterbox especially challenging.<br/>
