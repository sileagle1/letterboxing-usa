<br/>
Welcome to our first combined Letterbox/Geocache stash which was <br/>
planted on June 16, 2002.<br/>
<br/>
The T.H. site has a distinct "off the beaten track" feel, but is only <br/>
a short,  mile jaunt along (mostly) gently rolling, piney terrain <br/>
from where you'll park.  <br/>
<br/>
Get out your Hagstrom Map and find the intersection of New London <br/>
Turnpike and Congdon Mill Road in West Greenwich (it is accessible <br/>
from Route 3 (from the West) and Henry Brown Road (from the East), <br/>
both paved.  It is also accessible from the South by following New <br/>
London Turnpike north from 102, but be prepared for a stretch of <br/>
dirt).<br/>
<br/>
Once you're at the intersection of New London Turnpike and Congdon <br/>
Mill Road, drive approximately 1/10 mile Northwest on Congdon Mill <br/>
Road where you'll see the trail on your right leading into the <br/>
woods.  Park your car.  Head Northeast on this trail.  After just a <br/>
few minutes, you'll reach a junction where you'll turn right (a <br/>
huge "climbing" pine sits smack dab in the middle of the <br/>
intersection).  After turning right, walk another 10  15 minutes, <br/>
crossing a small bridge along the way, until you reach a "T" junction <br/>
in the trail where you'll meet Toaster Head.<br/>
