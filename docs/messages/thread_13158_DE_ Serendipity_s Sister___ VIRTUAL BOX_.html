                    <div class="plaintext-content">All the talk about virtual boxes and this situation of the "possibly" <br/>
missing box have given me an idea.<br/>
<br/>
Since I am in Michigan, I cannot just run out and verify whether this <br/>
box is actually missing or not.  It will be at least late summer <br/>
before I will be back out that way.  I have noted on the clues that <br/>
the box MAY be missing, however, it is small and was well hidden, so <br/>
as CuriousCrane indicates, MAYBE it is still there.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is a mystery box and requires a bit of research just to <br/>
find the location, I hate to send anyone down the trail only to come <br/>
up empty-handed.  So for anyone who is out that way looking for <br/>
boxes, looking for Serendipity's Sister in particular, if you get <br/>
there and are not able to find the box, send me a picture pointing to <br/>
the place where you believe the box should be per the clues -- not a <br/>
close up, I need to be able to get the big picture -- and I will send <br/>
you a scanned image of the stamp.  This is going to require you to <br/>
have a camera, but if you don't have a digital, you can either scan <br/>
in the photo, or send it to me snail mail (e-mail me for address in <br/>
this case).<br/>
<br/>
Depending on how well, this works, if it turns out the box is <br/>
actually missing, I may just keep this as a virtual type thing.<br/>

&gt; checking out several alternative spots. We couldn't believe it when <br/>

sense, <br/>
&gt; right under our noses the whole time. That box is well hidden, if <br/>
&gt; somewhat precariously. The grass was short when we went, with no <br/>
&gt; surrounding shrubbery. That was a good box so we hope it's still <br/>
&gt; there. We'll check next time we go that way, which might be next <br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving.<br/>

that <br/>

&gt; &gt; I doubt that I will be replacing this box, at least not in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Delaware...  I may carve up a similar stamp and place it in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Michigan.  I am finding that placing boxes while on vacation is <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; &gt; as good an idea as I had thought.  Just no easy way to keep up <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; &gt; the box and what is happening in the area.  I now understand why <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; geo-caching rules do not allow this.<br/>
