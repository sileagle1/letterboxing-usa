The brand is "Ancient Page" and is "acid free archival waterproof dye <br/>
inkpad".  They come in lots of fun colors and, best of all, they come <br/>
in a mini size, 2-1/4 X 1-1/2 inches.<br/>
<br/>
Also the lid snaps into the bottom of the inkpad -- one less thing to <br/>
drop in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
If you can't find them in a store around you, you can get at <br/>
Clearsnap, www.clearsnap.com. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else use these and like these?  We do!<br/>

I'm new to letterboxing and Ancient Page was one of the first ink pads I bought. I love them. <br/>
