                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sunday, I took a friend on a motorcycle ride and introduced her to<br/>
Letter Boxing. She got a book and I gave her a stamp I had made of a<br/>
dolphin and since she has a dolphin tatoo, it was perfect.<br/>
<br/>
We rode to the top of La Cumbre Peak and pushed our way through the<br/>
Manzanita and brambles and found STONEHEN. Everything Ron says about<br/>
his box is true. Great views but the brush will eat small animals.<br/>
<br/>
Then we went to Painted Cave and planted a LB for Don and Gwen. They<br/>
created a stamp inspired by the cave paintings.<br/>
<br/>
We couldn't find "Where Eagles Soar" but had a nice walk along the<br/>
shore of Cachuma Lake. Will have to go back there.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch in Solvang, we were off to Santa Ines (Ynez) Mission and<br/>
then to Nojoqui Falls. We had 8 stops on the list but only made 5.<br/>
Put 100 miles on the MC and a lot of it was dodging pot holes on<br/>
Camino Cielo &amp; Mountain Rds.<br/>
<br/>
I had gone out with my friend Ms in Summerland a couple of weeks ago<br/>
and we found "Buhda by the Stream", "Possum Crossin'" and the Ortega<br/>
Hill Loop series but it was before I had a logbook, so will have to<br/>
return to record them.<br/>
