<br/>
Wanted to take one last opportunity to remind everyone that this <br/>
Saturday August 7 is the first ever SouthEast Gathering. If you have <br/>
the time and the means to come visit, we'd love to meet ya! It <br/>
promises to be a much larger event than we first envisioned; there's <br/>
a distinct possibility that attendance will exceed 50 people. It's an <br/>
all-day gathering, to allow people the freedom to come-and-go, and <br/>
the park has a *wide* variety of entertainments for the non-boxing <br/>
members of the family. (This last includes a laser-show and fireworks <br/>
display at the base of the 825-foot high granite face of Stone <br/>
Mountain.) For the avid letterboxer, there's the opportunity to <br/>
collect more than 30 hand-carved images, and that doesn't even <br/>
include exchanges!<br/>
<br/>
Details and related links and info can be found at:<br/>

<br/>
If you want to contact some of the letterboxers who are attending <br/>
from at least nine southeastern states, please write to the letterbox-<br/>
southeast yahoo group and introduce yourself. We're going to have a <br/>
great time, and hope to see y'all there!<br/>
