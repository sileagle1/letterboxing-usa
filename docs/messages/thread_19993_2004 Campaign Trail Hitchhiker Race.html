                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have released a set of hitchhikers for the 2004 Campaign Trail <br/>
Hitchhiker Race.  The two hitchhikers are Kerry and Bush and they are <br/>
travelling seperately on the campaign trail in an attempt to "win" <br/>
the most electoral votes.  Each candidate will win one electoral vote <br/>
for each person (personal stamp) they greet, and one for each <br/>
campaign stop (letterbox) they reach.  In addition, they will win one <br/>
extra electoral vote for each state they visit.  The candidate with <br/>
the most electoral votes by Nov 4 is the winner.  Hmmmm.  Sound   <br/>
confusing?  I guess it is still easier than counting chads!!  <br/>
There are only 2 months until the election and the race is very <br/>
close, so the candidates need to move quickly to win.  And both WANT <br/>
to win so they are willing to do whatever it takes--even if it means <br/>
bending the rules a bit.  WIth that in mind, I will tell you where I <br/>
released the hitchhikers--one in Ma's Artistic Box in Vienna VA and <br/>
the other in Be's Search for the Mushroom Kingdom, also in Vienna, <br/>
VA.  They are anxious to move on to some swing states...<br/>
In the spirit of letterboxing, please move the hitchhikers along, <br/>
even if it is not your favorite candidate.  REMEMBER, this is meant <br/>
for fun and it NOT a political statement.<br/>
Please keep the group updated on the hitchhikers whereabouts...<br/>
And please remember to vote--every vote counts.<br/>

Many thanks to artdog for encouraging John Kerry's visit to the<br/>
Hoosier State.  He made an <br/>
appearance in Indy and will depart for states unknown this weekend.<br/>
