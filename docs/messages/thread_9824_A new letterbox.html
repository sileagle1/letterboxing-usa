The Hollyday Letterbox was planted on Christmas Eve, 2002, right before a winter storm, by Holly and Daddy.  The first to be planted in South Windsor, CT, and located beside the beautiful Connecticut River.  A lovely spot for a walk, and with the grills set up along the banks, a cookout is possible if you are so inclined.  Because you pass through a wildlife sanctuary and cornfields, don't be surprised to encounter many varieties of birds.  Today, we spotted a hawk perched high above a cornfield, surveying the countryside.  To our surprise and joy, a pheasant strode across our path.  And later, two ducks paddled by, enjoying a lovely, cold winter swim up the river.<br/>
<br/>
Because today is the eve of a Holiday, and the planters' name is Holly, we named our box the Hollyday Letterbox.  Every day is a holiday when you can get outside and be part of the beauty of nature, and we have picked a lovely spot indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Our box is hidden in a linear park on the banks of the Connecticut River, down Vibert Street, off Old Main Street, in South Windsor Connecticut.  Here's the directions:  From Interstate 84, take the exit for I-291 heading west.  Take the last exit before crossing the CT river, the Route 5 South Windsor exit.  Take a left at the light onto Route 5 north go approximately one mile until you see a Dunkin Donuts on the left.  Take a left at the Dunkin Donuts onto Pleasant Valley Road.  You will come to the end of Pleasant Valley Road and hit Old Main Street.  If you have time during your day, drive north on Old Main Street, as it is truly one of the most beautiful streets in America, miles of historic homes, especially pretty during Halloween and Christmas.  Once you hit Old Main, take a right and then your first left, onto Vibert Street.<br/>
