read the article and the reference to a possible box by the Times and/or <br/>
the author.  It really was a great article.<br/>
<br/>
And I don't intend to start any further of a debate about the subject, <br/>
because, as everyone knows, it has been beat to a pulp already, <br/>
bbbuuuuuttttt...  This article goes to show how the information from an <br/>
active (and legendary, if I may) boxer, with the addition of a lot of <br/>
accurate information, can really be relayed in a good manner through the <br/>
press.  I don't dare imagine what the article would be like if Rae <br/>
Record hadn't been so involved.  Kudos Rae!<br/>

Have a wonderful holiday season everyone,<br/>

Thanks for the link to this article. I enjoyed reading it. I can't <br/>
wait to take a trip out to the Cape to do some LB searching. My LB <br/>
buddy and I have talked about this a few times, I'll have to give <br/>
her a nudge. Hey Hawkwind, if you read this, consider yourself <br/>
nudged.<br/>
I actually found out about letterboxing from an article in <br/>
Prevention magazine about 2-3 years ago. I didn't even see the <br/>
article until about a year later when I came across the old magazine <br/>
in one of my "piles". Hopefully this Cape Cod Times article will <br/>
start at least one more addict - I mean fan. :)<br/>

Hello Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I just signed up today and noticed this discussion about the Cape Cod <br/>
Times article.  I read that article and I'm already obsessed!  I <br/>
can't wait to get started.  I will be bringing my 20 month old with <br/>
me.  This is perfect to keep us both busy some days!  Just waiting <br/>
for my stamp.....<br/>

Welcome to letterboxing. You certainly live in a "target rich" <br/>
