I just wanted to let everyone know that I have the Seeker's Delight <br/>
HH box. I will replace it if it ever stops raining on a Saturday. I <br/>
think that it is has rained every Saturday since Apri and one of <br/>
these days I want to go back out.<br/>
<br/>
MLG,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if you ever went to check on your box at the <br/>
University of Richmond. I would be curious to know if it was still <br/>
ther and we missed it. Thanks for looking.<br/>
