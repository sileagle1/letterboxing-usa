   Sorry to hear about the with and her wardrobe. Isabelle as I <br/>
heard was not a happy camper. You know: the house I live in I built <br/>
a house 4 years ago, and on the property was this HUGE boulder- a <br/>
rock combination of many. Compressed over a long time. And I <br/>
happened to be reading  The lion the Witch and the Wardrobe at the <br/>
time that the house was being built. And for some reason, I named <br/>
the big rock Mr. Tumnus. (the fawn dude in the story, ) and as funny <br/>
as it seemes, the name stuck. Whenever my mother has stale bread or <br/>
leftover pancakes, she tells me to go throw it up on top of Mr. <br/>
Tumnus for the crows to eat( which they do) and whenever my little <br/>
brother is outside playing on it, my mom always tells him to "get <br/>
off Mr. Tumnus, it's dinner time!" Or something of the sort. Its <br/>
very wierd that we have called him that, and we have a whole other <br/>
line of boulder ringing our back yard all with different names. I <br/>
know this has nothing to do with boxing but your post just reminded <br/>
me of that great book and my favorite rock. Unfortunately, I have <br/>
never gotten around to reading the rest of the Chronicals of <br/>
Narnia...<br/>

Read the others when you get the chance.  They're all pretty good, <br/>
but the first &amp; last are my favorites.<br/>
