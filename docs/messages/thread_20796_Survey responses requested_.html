                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello, I am a college student who is doing an ethnographic fieldstudy on the culture of letterboxers. I am seeking responses to my short 12-question survey from any and all letterboxers. Most questions are in a "choose one from the list" format while a few are in short answer form. It should not take more than 10 minutes of your time to complete. Your responses may be used in the final paper; I will email you directly to request your permission if I wish to quote you. This survey is for educational purposes ONLY. You may remain anonymous if you wish. I thank you in advance for completing this survey. This will be a HUGE help with my fieldstudy!<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

This is a scam. I got a similar response from another group I was in. It <br/>
asked for a simple survery for  a grad student to complete a project. It turned <br/>
out to be a marketing ploy. At the end of the survey you are asked  if you would <br/>
be willing to be on a mailing list to receive sales information on a subject <br/>
common to the group. The person who makes the request to complete the survey <br/>
get money for each name who completes the bogus survey and gets targeted <br/>
marketing. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. <br/>

I received a similar request from a supposed grad student who contacted me and other members of a group with similar interests. It requested filling out a survey to be used for data for a masters thesis. The grad student purported himself to be physically challenged and was gathering data on the use of adaptive equipment by members of a group of sports medicine healthcare providers. Naturally we all agreed. The survey took me a good 15 minutes. At the end it asked if I minded getting sales information from a company that markets stuff. By filling out this bogus survey I and my collegues identified ourselves as highly desirable customers. The person if truly a person was paid for supplying strong sales leads and spamers that now had active e-mail addresses knew who to target. Thus you can see what I was thinking. I did not intend to try to interfere with a genuine request<br/>

Dear Stewart,<br/>
<br/>
It only takes a moment and very nearly no thought at all to dash off <br/>
a hasty negative post.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a tremendous amount of listening, self reflection, and <br/>
courage to compose a thoughtful, articulate, explanatory, and <br/>
apologetic re-post.<br/>
<br/>
And for this, I thank you.<br/>
