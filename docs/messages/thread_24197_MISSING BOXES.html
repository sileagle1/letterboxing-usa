THE KEY LARGO AREA AND ALL THREE WERE MISSING. TWO IN "JOHN PENNEKAMP <br/>
STATE PARK" AND ONE IN A WILD BIRD CENTER.<br/>
"JOHN PENNEKAMP STATE PARK"<br/>
"WALKING TREES" BOX - THE CLUES WERE A LITTLE DIFFICULT, BUT WE ARE <br/>
FAIRLY SURE THAT WE FOUND THE BOX LOCATION IN A HOLLOW TREE NEAR A <br/>
SIGN ABOUT THE GOLDEN SPIDER. AFTER A EXTENSIVE SEARCH OF PULLING <br/>
LEAVES AND OTHER DEBRIS OUT OF THE HOLE AND DIGGING ABOUT SIX INCHES <br/>
INTO THE TRUNK WE DECIDED THAT THE BOX WAS A "MIA".<br/>
THE SECOND BOX IN THE PARK WAS PART OF THE "CONCH REPUBLIC SERIES". <br/>
WE FOUND THIS LOCATION WITH OUT ANY PROBLEM.  THE HOLLOWED OUT PIECE <br/>
OF CORAL WAS EMPTY AND THE ROCKS COVERING THE ENTRANCE WERE STREWN <br/>
AROUND. THIS ONE ALSO APPEARS TO BE A "MIA".<br/>
OUR THIRD DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE DAY CAME AT THE "WILD BIRD CENTER" IN <br/>
KEY LARGO. THE DIRECTIONS WERE STRAIGHT FORWARD AND THE ONLY PROBLEM <br/>
IN FINDING THE LOCATION IS THAT IT IS NOW OFF LIMITS TO VISITORS. WE <br/>
ASKED PERMISSION FROM A EMPLOYEE AND HE SAID OK.  WE CONTINUED ON THE <br/>
TRAIL AND FOUND THE TREE AND THE ROCKS BEHIND IT, BUT AGAIN THERE WAS <br/>
NO BOX.ANOTHER "MIA".<br/>
THIS IS THE DOWN SIDE OF LETTER BOXING. WE STARTED GOOD, BUT HAD A <br/>
BAD DAY TODAY. TOMORROW WILL BE ANOTHER CHALLENGE.<br/>

<br/>
But, could you please turn off your caps lock? In internet speak,<br/>
right now you are screaming at all of us for no reason. I'm usually<br/>
pretty live-and-let-live in terms of emails and posts and whatnot --<br/>
typos and chatspeak and all doesn't really bother me. But, it would be<br/>
easier to read without all the capitalization, and I do want to read<br/>
what you have to tell us! Thanks!<br/>
