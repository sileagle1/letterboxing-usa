                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since we pretty much stick to the PNW pages, we are not sure how you <br/>
all, in Cincy, update your boxes.  My niece said that every box they <br/>
have searched for, was not where it was supposed to be.  (She is new <br/>
and may not understand how it works).  For instance, she said the <br/>
Symms Park box is definately not there, it is too small a park to <br/>
miss it!<br/>
<br/>
  Anyway, we have very little time and sooooo much to do.  We will be <br/>
in the Loveland/Milford/Blue Ash/Mariemont and maybe Eastgate or <br/>
downtown areas. <br/>
<br/>
So, can anyone let us know which boxes are for sure in place in the <br/>
area so that we can bee-line for them.  Scoutdogs or Franzolo?? Can <br/>
you help?<br/>
<br/>
The more planning we can do the more possibilities we have for <br/>
leaving a goodie or 2 for you!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
