                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Another eventful day in DC. It all started with the drive to <br/>
Pentagon City Mall. It seems I can never ever get through DC without <br/>
getting horribly lost. This time I can blame it on Silver Fox and his <br/>
desire for short cuts that always wind up as long cuts. And the lack <br/>
of directional signs in the I395 Tunnel. What should have been a 55 <br/>
minute drive took 2 hours and 10 min. Silver Fox was so worried <br/>
everyone would be gone, but Princess Turtle and I assured him that <br/>
wouldn't happen. He had never been to a Gather and wasn't expecting <br/>
the frenzy. Timid at first he jumped in and proudly exchanged his <br/>
virgin stamp. Princess Turtle decided that shopping would take <br/>
precedent over exchanges. So she flitted between the two as fast as a <br/>
turtle can flit.<br/>
   Upon arriving I sat next to an adorable little girl. We chatted <br/>
and I asked if she had a stamp. She replied yes. Would you like to do <br/>
an exchange and she said no. I liked her immediately, someone honest <br/>
and to the point. Later I found out her "name" is Runner, DVN2RCKR's<br/>
daughter. <br/>
   It was great to finally meet DVN2RCKR. I've always been in awe of <br/>
her stamina. Thanks Bethany for bringing all those stamps from the <br/>
PNW. My stamp book #2 is now complete with the KMARTHA stamp. WooHoo!!<br/>
   Thanks Scarab for hosting the event. Six event stamps were created <br/>
by some very talented carvers. I especially liked the one where a <br/>
boxer has fallen through the ice. It bought back memories of my mud <br/>
incident. You can be assured this gal won't even dream of attempting <br/>
to cross any frozen water.  <br/>
   Unfortunately we had a prior engagement so we couldn't make the <br/>
mystery dinner. To find out a certain mystery guest made an <br/>
appearance and I missed him has me very bummed. <br/>
   I was prepared to meet Randy (had a bottle of beer in backpack) <br/>
and do an exchange for his Traveler Box. Someday, our paths will <br/>
cross. Hopefully I can say the same for Monsieur.<br/>
   Leaving Pentagon City and traveling across the bridge over the <br/>
very frozen Potomac I couldn't help but smile at the aptly titled <br/>
event. Thanks to all for a great day.<br/>
   Psychomommy, Princess Turtle and Silver Fox<br/>
