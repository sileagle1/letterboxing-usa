                    <html><body>Hello all:<br/>
Sorry to hear that some of you in the north east are having so much snow.  Team CocoJul went out boxing last weekend, while visiting friends in South Florida.  We had a lovely time, and we were able to locate 2 very wonderful boxes placed by the Terrapin Travelers!  We found the "Florida Friends" box and "The Gods Have Spoken" box.  Since they were so recently placed, we were hoping to be first, but, alas, we were second to stamp in.  Thank you Terrapin Travelers for a great experience on both boxes!<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Julie of Team CocoJul</body></html>
