<br/>
Please join us in southeastern Connecticut for a weekend get together<br/>
to do some letterboxing. After polling the list, we found the best<br/>
weekend for everyone will be May 13-14th. We have both camping and<br/>
lodging options for your stay:<br/>
<br/>
Camping at Rocky Neck State Park in East Lyme. No reservations<br/>
necessary: there are lots of sites available on a first come/first<br/>
served basis. My family and I will go over Friday evening and/or early<br/>
Saturday morning and stake out our favorite sites ahead of time for the<br/>
group. Rocky Neck is a beach campground with some beautiful wetlands<br/>
and upland hiking. Directions: from I-95, take exit 72, the Rocky Neck<br/>
Connector. At the end of the road, turn left and find the park on your<br/>
right. For info, the telephone is (860)739-5471, and check online at  <br/>
http://dep.state.ct.us/rec/parks/rnsppav.htm  and  <br/>
http://dep.state.ct.us/rec/parks.htm#Parks  <br/>
<br/>
We've got two recommendations for lodging: across the street from Rocky<br/>
Neck is a funky little 1950s era roadside motel, the Rocky Neck Motor<br/>
Inn (tel: 860-739-6268). A couple of miles down the road is a wonderful<br/>
B&amp;B, the Inn at Harbor Hill Marina (tel: 860-739-0331, and online at<br/>
http://www.innharborhill.com <br/>
<br/>
All the sites are surrounded by a multitude of fabulous letterboxes,<br/>
and although we can't duplicate last year's hot-tub bonding, there is a<br/>
terrific little blues club/brew pub in Niantic. Looking forward to<br/>
seeing you!<br/>

<br/>
I replied to Jay off-list that I will be at the May gathering, but <br/>
wanted to start the flood of enthusiastic replies to the list as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
My family will likely not join me this time, though Anne and/or Dave <br/>
may be persuaded. I plan to show up Friday around 6 pm at the State <br/>
Park, looking for one of the prime campsites that Jay is picking out! <br/>
If it's rainy I could conceivably head for the B&amp;B but we'll see. <br/>
Sounds like a great plan. Is it too early in the season for a <br/>
clambake?<br/>

Best to all,<br/>

<br/>
 Welcome back. I'm very glad to hear you'll be at the May gathering - <br/>
it should be fantastic, with the spring, the sea, the unmatched <br/>
number of prizes to be found, and the camraderie.<br/>
<br/>
Kim and Royce will be arriving Friday night, though Kim said they may <br/>
have to stay at a public campground, because she is bringing her dog. <br/>
I'll be arriving Friday late afternoon, and staying at the State Park <br/>
(unless it's pouring!) <br/>
<br/>
See you soon.<br/>

Sorry I didn't get back to you the other day. I'm so glad you can <br/>
make it next month. I'll see you sometime Friday evening. I can head <br/>
out around 2:30 Friday afternoon, but will probably stop in Lincoln <br/>
to look for Sarah's Lucky Penny, so I'm not sure what time I'll get <br/>
to the park.<br/>
<br/>
Jay, what do you recommend for supper Friday night? Do we want to <br/>
plan on eating at a restaurant, cook communally, or cook separately? <br/>
Are wood fires possible at the park, or do we need to bring stoves?<br/>

&gt; &gt; We've got two recommendations for lodging: across the street from <br/>
&gt; Rocky<br/>
&gt; &gt; Neck is a funky little 1950s era roadside motel, the Rocky Neck <br/>
&gt; Motor<br/>
&gt; &gt; Inn (tel: 860-739-6268). A couple of miles down the road is a <br/>
&gt; wonderful<br/>
&gt; &gt; B&amp;B, the Inn at Harbor Hill Marina (tel: 860-739-0331, and online at<br/>
&gt; &gt; http://www.innharborhill.com <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; All the sites are surrounded by a multitude of fabulous letterboxes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and although we can't duplicate last year's hot-tub bonding, there <br/>
&gt; is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; terrific little blues club/brew pub in Niantic. Looking forward to<br/>
&gt; &gt; seeing you!<br/>

We're really getting excited about this get together and hope it's a <br/>
great time for all. I'd suggest we do something simple at the <br/>
campground for supper, so that people can trickle in without worrying <br/>
about being "on time" for dinner. With daylight savings time on, I'm <br/>
starting to enjoy the evening hours outdoors more, and it's possible <br/>
that penny may take longer to find than you expect......!!!<br/>
<br/>
I've blocked my afternoon schedule for Friday and should be able to <br/>
stake out some great campsites for us. I'll go with the kids tomorrow <br/>
and scout them out and send a note back to help you find them on <br/>
arrival.<br/>

&gt;  Dear John,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry I didn't get back to you the other day. I'm so glad you can <br/>
&gt; make it next month. I'll see you sometime Friday evening. I can <br/>
head <br/>
&gt; out around 2:30 Friday afternoon, but will probably stop in Lincoln <br/>
&gt; to look for Sarah's Lucky Penny, so I'm not sure what time I'll get <br/>
&gt; to the park.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jay, what do you recommend for supper Friday night? Do we want to <br/>
&gt; plan on eating at a restaurant, cook communally, or cook <br/>
separately? <br/>
&gt; Are wood fires possible at the park, or do we need to bring stoves?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tom<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Jay,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I can't recall if I ever replied as to our intentions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I will attend the gathering, and will be camping.  I hope to make <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; &gt; up on Friday evening and spend 2 nights.  The only question is <br/>
&gt; &gt; whether or not my family will join me.  I'm going to try to <br/>
encourage <br/>
&gt; &gt; them to, since it looks like there'll be others of their age <br/>
group.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Very much looking forward to it.<br/>
