                    <div class="plaintext-content">October, it seems was a great month for letterboxing in our area - we <br/>
found over 150 new boxes this month, and almost all were in CT! This <br/>
was due in large part to all the boxes placed by relative newcomers <br/>
to letterboxing in both eastern and western,CT (such as the planters <br/>
of the Poindexter Preserve boxes that I got to meet the day after <br/>
Pete was there - since he went while I was off dancing at the NOMAD <br/>
folk festival on the weekend! - and the Lil' Banditos, whose hikes <br/>
and handmade notebooks with little gold bangles we just adore!), as <br/>
well as to the incredibly well-organized and prolific plantings of CT <br/>
Kids' Day - the most mind-boggling array of boxes and sweet treats <br/>
imaginable! We're also glad we got to recycle the Golden Teddy and <br/>
the Human Pumpkin there - thanks to little Liam in his adorable <br/>
pumpkin outfit! - but decided to keep another newer box in its <br/>
original cushy home at Pasquiset Pond in RI, rather than digging it <br/>
out just for the day, so, anyone who wants to find the box "1st", <br/>
please check our webpage! I also put in a little add-on to Laurette's <br/>
Tin Tin box in the Great Swamp of RI, but I'll have to get Pete to <br/>
post that later. Meanwhile, we're off to CT for more woodland walks! <br/>
(and many even other states if those CT planters ever take a break!)<br/>
Thanks again to everyone!<br/>
