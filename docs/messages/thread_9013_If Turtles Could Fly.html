think you were able to do it so quickly because you can fly.<br/>
   I on the other hand have The Turtle to contend with. Twice she has <br/>
collapsed on the trail and just about given up. Once was Squirrels <br/>
Sugarloaf Box, that was our own fault as we missed a turn. The other <br/>
was Ladybugs longa** hike to get to her first box. That was in <br/>
Virginia. Turtles have short legs you know! And lately (age 13 today) <br/>
short attention spans!<br/>
  See you tomorrow,<br/>
