boxing I tried to carve my stamps with it.  I doesn't work well for detail<br/>
work but for clunky stamps for my daughter to carve it's great and it's<br/>
cheap!<br/>

Does foam board disintegrate if it gets wet? Another alternative that <br/>
I saw Franzsolo using (&amp; I copied :-) was thick craft foam. I haven't <br/>
found it in large sheets, but craft stores sell it as blank doorknob <br/>
hangers (like for 'do not disturb' signs that can be hung on a door <br/>
knob). It's about 1/4" thick, a little flexible, comes in several <br/>
different colors and it's waterproof. <br/>
I found a glue called Elmer's Craft Bond 'Ultra Stix All' that has <br/>
worked really well with it. It sticks almost anything together, stays <br/>
slightly flexible, it waterproof, dries clear, etc. etc. <br/>
Just me 2 cents :-)<br/>
