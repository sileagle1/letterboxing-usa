My "Temporary Haiku" mystery letterbox (listed on the LBNA web site) is <br/>
actually much *more* accessible now/in snow than in the summer.  It <br/>
hadn't had many visitors as of early fall, when it was so overgrown as <br/>
to be almost inaccessible.  That's the last time I checked on it - <br/>
figured that if I, the planter, had trouble locating it, it ought to be <br/>
fine in situ for quite a while.  Barring vandals of any sort since then, <br/>
it should be very easy to find &amp; grab from now through early spring.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>

a year ago....  Even if is more accessible... I don't have a clue <br/>
where to START looking! I've spent hours googling... and studying <br/>
NoVa maps for "Milk" names.<br/>
<br/>
It's still a mystery to me!  Good One!!!<br/>
