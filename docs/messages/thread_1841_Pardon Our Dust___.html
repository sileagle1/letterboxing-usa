<br/>
By now, most of you have noticed some strange things happening on the <br/>
Letterboxing North America Web site. There have been bits and pieces of <br/>
mismatched color schemes floating around, and a few states have started <br/>
organizing clues differently. Perhaps you've been wondering what's going on <br/>
Behind The Scenes, so to speak…<br/>
<br/>
Well, your time to wonder has ended. Today, February 1, 2001, we, the LbNA <br/>
Webmasters, have launched the prototype of our newly formatted Web site. We <br/>
hope the new look of the interface helps to capture a bit of the Essence… the <br/>
Spirit… of the Letterboxing Experience.<br/>
<br/>
The changes being made are not only cosmetic in nature. Numerous attempts <br/>
have been made to enhance the functional and practical aspects of the site. <br/>
One of the most significant changes you will be seeing is a move AWAY from <br/>
detailed regional maps. Instead of showing each letterbox location as a <br/>
separate dot on the State pages, we will be migrating toward map-driven <br/>
TABLES of letterbox clues. This will help lighten the load for the faithful <br/>
volunteers who maintenance the site, and should help shorten the amount of <br/>
time it takes to see new clues posted on the site.<br/>
<br/>
Just a reminder... if you have problems to report regarding the new <br/>
site/clues/etc., they should be posted directly to the Webmasters, rather <br/>
than the main list, unless the comment is of general interest. This, of <br/>
course, is simply a matter of list volume, and not overwhelming people who <br/>
are uninterested in such technical discussions. The email address for the <br/>
LbNA Webmasters is:<br/>
<br/>
LbNA-Webmasters@yahoogroups.com<br/>
  (LbNA-Webmasters at yahoogroups.com)<br/>
<br/>
We will be continuing to make tweaks and updates for the next several weeks, <br/>
as there is a great deal of material on the site to reformat and debug.  We <br/>
thank you all for your patience during this time of change.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch (Der Mad Stamper) Klink<br/>
LbNA Co-Webmaster<br/>
