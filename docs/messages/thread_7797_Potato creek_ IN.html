I found the potato creek letterbox in Indiana.  It was a bit of a push over<br/>
a gravel path, but with assistance this box is wheelchair accessible.  I had<br/>
to go off the path to actually find it, but I was within eyesight of my<br/>
husband so he could enjoy the actually "find"<br/>
<br/>
This was our first attempt at finding a box and we were pleased that we<br/>
could do it together.  On our next visit to Indiana we will go after the<br/>
other ones in the state.<br/>
