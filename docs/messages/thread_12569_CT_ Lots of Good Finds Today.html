Butterfly and I got 14 finds (15 for me, as I finished off the Gazebo <br/>
at last). Our last box was really cause for celebration, as we <br/>
completed a mystery set where Uphill had eluded us last time. <br/>
We really ("wa-hooed" over that!). Too bad we have to tend to our <br/>
gardens tomorrow! Those mysteries need more visitors, so start <br/>
solving!<br/>
