I'm sorry, I couldn't find your email address and had closed up the box, and am not on the PLB group yet.  So I hope you're out there somewhere; I just wanted you to know how nifty the Pickle Jar is and that we enjoyed it, and that I've sent it on to the next person on the list, in Rochester, NY.  If you'd like to email me for more info. or the confirmation #,  email me off-list at annalisa@fast.net  .  I'd also be interested in writing the little poem you had in the box beside its stamp in my journal, so if you wouldn't mind sending it to me I'd be thrilled. Also I've already forgotten the brand name of that chalk color you had, but it's really nice stuff.  Thanks!  --lunaryakketyact  (Anna Lisa Y.)<br/>
