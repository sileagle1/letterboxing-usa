<br/>
Box placed by Letters &amp; Lattes - April 26, 2003<br/>
<br/>
There's a park in Virginia Beach that has the same name as one of <br/>
the "Peanuts" gang.  It's a small park, so getting your bearings once <br/>
you find it should be easy.  Park in the main (only)parking lot.  <br/>
Locate the baseball diamond.  To get there, you'll pass a play area <br/>
meant for Snoppy and his four-footed pals.  To find the box, stand on <br/>
the pitcher's mound.  Pretend you're Charlie Brown  winding up for a <br/>
knock-your-socks-off pitch.  Take a compass bearing of 300. Walk <br/>
toward the trees.  You'll find one tree covered with carved <br/>
initials.   Stand on the side of the tree with "DT + CA 4 EVER".  (I <br/>
hope DT loves CA as much as Sally loves her "Sweet Baboo"!)  Take <br/>
another compass bearing of 230.  You'll see a tree with a hole at <br/>
the base of the trunk.  The stamp dedicated to Sparky's friend lies <br/>
inside.  Please recover the box with bark once you've recorded your <br/>
visit!<br/>
<br/>
This park is dog and kid friendly.  It's open from 7:30 am to sundown <br/>
and has tennis courts,horseshoe pit and playground.  There are <br/>
several picnic tables with BBQ grills.  Also pavilions that can be <br/>
reserved for groups.  Bathrooms, drink machine and phone are <br/>
available.  ENJOY!<br/>
