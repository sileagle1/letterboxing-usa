I *should* be getting the photos back from summer when Brian helped me<br/>

Son &amp; friend (ages 7) hiding the Enigma Stone &amp; Mad River letterboxes on<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thom is smart to advise that we don't get too caught up in the Kids Corner<br/>
project.  We can't let it take precedence over the need to get more boxes out<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all agree, however, that getting kids interested in letterboxing<br/>
will be important to the survival of the hobby.  Of course, we want to make<br/>
sure that the effort put into any online project is justified by the learning<br/>
process it supports.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the project has to be to introduce kids to the concept of<br/>
letterboxing, and show them how to carve a stamp, make a box, use a map, and<br/>
read a compass.  This needs to be accomplished in an easy-to-understand format<br/>
and in a way that is fun and interesting to kids.<br/>
<br/>
Randy suggests that before we get too caught up in content and graphics, we<br/>
need to establish our basic structure.  Then we can flesh it out as needed.  I<br/>
think this is good advice, so I've put together a bare-bones first draft.<br/>
<br/>
What I have tried to do is create a practical exercise for young map readers<br/>
that gives them an idea of what it's like to use a map and compass to follow a<br/>
series of steps from one point to another.<br/>
<br/>
http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/q1.htm<br/>
<br/>
The map is just something I threw together quickly.  We could easily adapt<br/>
this concept to a nicer, more detailed map at a later date.  For now, I just<br/>
wanted to get something posted that we could try out and critique and decide<br/>
if it will be useful.<br/>
<br/>
I included a crude attempt at the zoom feature (magnifying glass) that Dan<br/>
mentioned, although it serves little purpose for this over-simlified sample<br/>
map.<br/>
<br/>
This first draft version will look better on Explorer browsers than on<br/>
Netscape.  Netscape browsers will show the map broken up into sections.  I<br/>
will figure out a fix for this problem when I get time, but meanwhile I wanted<br/>
to let you all see what I have so far, in order to keep the ball rolling and<br/>
get this project finished so we can move on to other things.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your continuing input.<br/>

I suppose that is always a possibility Thom, but I think we are going to<br/>
minimize the cyberbox feel as much as possible without eliminating the <br/>
teaching element for the kids (and really for adults).  I think this can<br/>
work to bring all of the "About Letterboxing" and "Getting Started"<br/>
stuff together into a neat little scenario if we do it carefully and<br/>
thoughtfully.  The Kids will see what's going on and so will the adults<br/>
I think.<br/>
<br/>
This is fun seeing everybody working together like this<br/>
offering ther time and talents.<br/>
<br/>
Tom Cooch is learning how to help with the web editing and he is a great<br/>
help.  I gave him my ID and password and some of the programs I use and <br/>
he's off to the races!  Cool!<br/>
