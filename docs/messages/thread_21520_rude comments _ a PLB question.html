                    <div class="plaintext-content">Has the question of region of occurance been answered yet?  I'm scanning messages but may have missed.  I've yet to find something offensive like that in KY, TN, GA, SC, FL...although someone I knew wrote "Your momma" in one, and it was funny.  The spectre of my momma was a running joke between us for a long time, but I can see where some would want to eradicate such, although I would be extremely upset over ripped out pages and marking outs.  I do like the wrapping of the log book idea.  What makes a person write something vs. pitching the logbook would provide fascinatiing speculation and discussion.<br/>
<br/>
On another note has anyone ever done a PLB involving writing a child's story or a simple story and the stamp is the illustrating for your part?  It would be a long-term kind of thing, but interesting.  Someone writes a page, makes a stamp, sends it to the next who picks up the story line, adds a page and their stamp.  I think I'd like to start a PLB about Muenster The Weiner Dog, but don't want to delve into a vein that's been overly mined.  <br/>

Hey, I'm lovin' all the security tips.  Great points.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
