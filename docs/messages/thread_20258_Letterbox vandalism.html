                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, that's true mostly and it is, in fact, the NY vandal who has <br/>
caused this discussion to be raised.  I and others on this board have <br/>
attempted to proactively find a solution to this problem where many <br/>
others see it as an inherrent risk in the game.<br/>
<br/>
The thing with terrorism, as you use the analogy, is that once it <br/>
happened, we had to act -- tighten security, etc.  We didn't simply <br/>
say "it's a risk of being American" and keep everything the same.<br/>
<br/>
In fairness, there really is no comparison to losing one box in <br/>
upstate NY and 3,000 lives in NY, DC, and Penn. and the theft of a NY <br/>
box has not yet spun so out of control that it has damaged this <br/>
hobby.  But what if it does?  I'd rather be proactive than reactive.<br/>
<br/>
The idea was never meant to be exclusionary to true letterboxers, of <br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
Enough people have weighed in on this issue, and it seems that there <br/>
is plenty of support for password protecting the LbNA site -- and <br/>
plenty of opposition to it as well.  I say the poll is not moot <br/>
because it will fully demonstrate the opinion of the community, so <br/>
continue to vote there, even if discussion of this matter on these <br/>
boards now closes.  It appears, based on the current results, that <br/>
those of us who favor password protecting the clues will lose by a <br/>
slight margin, and that's OK -- it's how a democratic community works.<br/>
<br/>
It's not going to chase me away from this hobby, it's not going to <br/>
make me hate all of the people who said "No" to the idea. It's not <br/>
even going to make me lock all of my clues away or revert to WOM <br/>
only.  We'll continue on as we have and hope that the NY vandal <br/>
incident was a one-time thing.  If it was, great. Issue erased -- for <br/>
now.  If it returns, or this box-stealing becomes epidemic, then <br/>
we'll need to revisit this topic again.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, my quest for boxes continues ...<br/>
