Back through the field to the road of gravel, is where you must begin your travel. <br/>
<br/>
Look to your right, then left and beyond, follow your nose to the pond. <br/>
<br/>
 Where the water rushes down into the ground, turn right to seek what can be found. <br/>
<br/>
Call it what you may a dam or a dike, it is the way you must take this hike. <br/>
<br/>
Turn left if you have the brain and the gumption, when you come to the very next junction. <br/>
<br/>
The clues I made you must follow, and be sure to turn into Deer Hollow. <br/>
<br/>
You will come to a T, whether bird, beast or snail and then you'll go right on the Arcola Trail. <br/>
<br/>
 Count when you walk these multiple reps and stop when you reach 30 steps. <br/>
<br/>
To your left can be seen a rock conglomerate, what you seek can be found not far from it. <br/>
<br/>
If you found the prize and did not fail, turn around and follow the Nature Center trail. <br/>
