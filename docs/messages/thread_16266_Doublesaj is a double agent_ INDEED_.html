&gt; (P.S.  Doublesaj, while you were here, did you by any chance leave <br/>
&gt; behind something plastic of an important financial nature in any <br/>
&gt; local business while you were in town?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Why, yes it did. I realized this when we stopped in Los Osos the next morning <br/>
on our way to the Elfin Forrest (via the Washington Mutual ATM) and called <br/>
the establishment from which said plastic had  a sleep-over. <br/>
After giving them pertinant information, hey assurred me it was on its way <br/>
home and I should be receiving it today in my mailbox.<br/>
<br/>
As for the double agent remark, on my behalf I must protest! The Stamping in <br/>
the Meadow event was such a remarkable good time that I did not wish to <br/>
alienate either my host or hostess. I was only supporting their respective beliefs <br/>
in what is most assuredly a controversial sport. <br/>
<br/>
I am in a quandary on the whole thing: on one hand, the thought of wasting <br/>
food is abhorrent to me. (Then, I realize it's a toss-up whether the <br/>
plastic-covereing or the orange innards are closest to food!) On the other hand, after <br/>
watching the demonstration, I was quite entertained! Couple this with the fact <br/>
that although the 20 stamps placed in the park were all wonderful and amazing <br/>
in their own way, the Pro-Cheese Racing stamp was my favorite.<br/>
<br/>
So, you see, I still can't make up my mind which side I will take on the <br/>
issue. But I support fully your right to race or not to race. (Wow, you'd think I <br/>
was a Libra with all this indecision!!)<br/>
<br/>
Yours in letterboxing,<br/>

I WONDERED how you knew of my predicament! Thanks for taking care of that <br/>

This is INDEED a load off my mind. I am very uncomfortable having people<br/>
uspet with me especially when no offense was intended. Thanks!!<br/>
