Thanks so much for your response! We were pretty sure that we were in the <br/>
correct location, after checking any possible options. There was a huge <br/>
amount of dead fall, rotting from time dead fall, several stumps had fallen <br/>
over with age and decay.We tried under every stump and rock combo that come <br/>
close to looking like South Africa...knees and finger nails were filled with <br/>
dirt. We sat on what could have been a large representation of South Africa <br/>
and wished after looking so long that something would jump out at us, and <br/>
then we put our hands and then arms up to the shoulders into any variation <br/>
of cubbyhole we could find.I had faith that the snakes would prefer a warmer <br/>
sunny location!<br/>
It was not our day..despite our heroic efforts!<br/>
Glad you found it!<br/>
<br/>
See Joy<br/>
