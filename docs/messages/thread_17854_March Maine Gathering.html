The date for the "Letterboxing at Laudholm" gathering will be Sunday,<br/>
March 21st from 11 am to 4 pm to be held at the Wells National<br/>
Estuarine Research Reserve in Wells, Maine. There will be a potluck<br/>
lunch from 11 to 12:30 with plenty of boxes planted on the 7 miles of<br/>
trails here - some just for the day and some new ones that will<br/>
remain here permanently.<br/>
More details coming soon including a potential exciting guest speaker<br/>
(let me clarify- she's definitely exciting, but we have to make sure<br/>
she can definitely come- that's the part that is potential).<br/>
Nautilus and Phyto will be co-hosting this event but would welcome<br/>
the assistance or suggestions of others.<br/>
Kindly let us know if you plan on attending so we can get an idea of<br/>
numbers. You can respond on the list or to either Phyto or myself<br/>
directly via e-mail. Thanks!<br/>
Nautilus<br/>

My family and I are hoping to make it on Sunday, March 21. That <br/>
includes me, my husband and two kids ages almost 5 and 2. My husband <br/>
travels a lot, but he should be home that weekend. (If he's away, I <br/>
don't think I'll make the trip. Hiking with two little ones by <br/>
myself would be a bit ambitious.) We live in Topsham (near <br/>
Brunswick), so it looks like a pretty easy trip. We're new to Maine <br/>
and haven't explored too much. We're also fairly new to <br/>
letterboxing, but we're getting the hang of it. I'd be glad to bring <br/>
something for lunch, of course. What else can I do to help? Have you <br/>
gotten responses from many others? Thanks! Peace, Deborah<br/>
