                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a long day of hunting yesterday and are proud to say that we <br/>
found 3 boxes! :)<br/>
<br/>
We started with Wolf Box, and ended up walking in circles for about <br/>
an hour. The first few clues are a little confusing once you're out <br/>
there. The box is in great shape though, and has two log books. A <br/>
clue in the second book leads to a beautiful spot. :)<br/>
<br/>
Dance of Joy was next, and very easy to find. It's in great shape, <br/>
and has the cutest stamp. ThunderWing (our 12 yr. old) really liked <br/>
that one.<br/>
<br/>
Next up was Brandywine Box. The clues are pretty easy to follow and <br/>
we found it with no problem. We did have to cross an overgrown field <br/>
with stickers in it though.  (which we didn't know where there until <br/>
we where halfway through the field) SecretAgent (my partner) also had <br/>
a close run in with a frisbee! The box is in good shape, but there's <br/>
no stamp in it. The box is abandoned (I think) and if I had a spare <br/>
stamp with me, I would have put it in there. I may go back sometime <br/>
and leave one. There are also a few not so nice notes scribbled in <br/>
the log book by what I think were some kids out playing frisbee golf <br/>
that happened upon the box. *shakes head in disgust at how <br/>
disrespectful some people can be* It was a long hike back to the car <br/>
also, but it may just have seemed like it since we were so tired <br/>
already. LOL <br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a nice day though. We're hoping to get up to PA on <br/>
Sunday and then possibly down to the shore on Wednesday. I wish there <br/>
were more boxes in DE though. Maybe I'll have to plant a few. ;)<br/>

There are some neaby boxes in NJ: Sepawna Meadows and the NJ Maritime <br/>
Mystery boxes. We found these boxes on a warm November day. I would <br/>
highly recommend using bug spray if you try these in the summer. <br/>

No wonder I couldn't find clues for it anywhere. LOL<br/>
I think I figured out where your NJ Maritime Mystery boxes are <br/>
though. Now I just have to find time to get to Jersey. :)<br/>
I still haven't figured out Serendipity's Sister yet, but I will. I <br/>
think you're becoming my arch nemesis or something like that. <br/>
I haven't had a chance to find the other two virtual boxes of yours <br/>
yet, but I'll get them too. ("I'll get you my pretty, and your little <br/>
dog too!")  LOL<br/>
