                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW!!! What a series.  We were behind the Needeeps and in front of <br/>
the Columbia Bugs and Paw Across America doing the series today.  Was <br/>
able to run into both groups though and it was a pleasure talking <br/>
with you all.  The series is GREAT!!!  To everyone involved in the <br/>
series, planting, making a box, etc... very nicely done, the kids <br/>
knew almost all the book, and my wife did know all the books.  I <br/>
can't say enough about this series.  Special thanks goes out to <br/>
Irishtinker, Freedom Fox, Ladybug98, Rosie Bunny, and RTRW for <br/>
planting the boxes.  Teach &amp; Preach, Little Piggy, and Nappy Kitty.<br/>
