Just to add in our two cents about the "should we list it as missing" <br/>
debate.  This email is a good example.  Sometimes someone has trouble <br/>
finding a box (or three) but that doesn't mean they are missing.  We all <br/>
interpret clues differently and have different levels of determination.  I <br/>
think a box shouldn't be labeled missing until the planter verifies the <br/>
fact.<br/>
<br/>
Team BeMa has certainly not found more than our share of boxes!!  (which we <br/>
always whine about and let everyone know!)  Most of the times someone from <br/>
the list (usually the planter) emails us back with questions or hints and we <br/>
find the box on a second try.<br/>
<br/>
When we found the Hidden Pond boxes, there were several mentions in the logs <br/>
concerning difficulty finding box #1.  That is why we wanted to let people <br/>
know that it was still there, perhaps just a little further back than we had <br/>
anticipated or hidden by new growth.  We certainly don't want to give <br/>
anything away, but to clarify things that we found confusing (such as the <br/>
two Greeley Blvds that never connect).  We hope this is helpful (we really <br/>
appreciate the insight from others, especially info such as "really far for <br/>
children" or "very muddy right now" etc.)<br/>
<br/>
Just a note that "missing" is often "we couldn't find it".  I would hate to <br/>
discourage others from seeking a box that someone listed as missing if it is <br/>
truly still there.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!  BeMa<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;The day before we left for vacation, I received an email saying the three<br/>
&gt;boxes at Hidden Pond were missing! OH... stab me in the heart! Our first<br/>
&gt;plant and they were already missing! I thought about our poor boxes all<br/>
&gt;weekend, but thankfully team BeMa found all three alive and well on July<br/>
&gt;6th!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When we placed the boxes in March the tree/bush growth was minimal. Box #1<br/>
&gt;is a bit far off the trail. The naturalist at Hidden Pond helped us find<br/>
&gt;spots for the letterboxes (NOT once did he mention "swamp<br/>
&gt;snakes"...eeeewwww).  As with anything, the more you practice (writing<br/>
&gt;clues, giving directions, placing boxes etc.) the better you become...next<br/>
&gt;time we'll place them alittle closer to the trail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I plan to revise the driving directions to emphasize the 2nd Greeley Blvd<br/>
&gt;entrance, it is very confusing if you're not familiar with the area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Happy Homeschoolers<br/>
