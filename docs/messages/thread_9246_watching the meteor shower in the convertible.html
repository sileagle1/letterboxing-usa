                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not a bad way to start the morning huh?  Sarah and I found a pretty <br/>
groovy spot outside of town and got quite a show.  It was exceedingly <br/>
cold but our thermoses and blankets kept us relatively comfy.<br/>
<br/>
We saw well over 100 meteors including some really big greenish ones.<br/>
Since I hadn't seen one of these before, does anyone know if this one <br/>
lived up to the predictions?  I had expected more of a downpour <br/>
during the peak but maybe the moonlight prevented us from seeing some <br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
According to Cat's husband, the ring around the moon means snow is on <br/>
the way so bundle up if you are wandering out today.  Sarah is <br/>
dragging me up a mountain so I will pop in later with new clues and a <br/>
long list of body aches.<br/>

                    <html><body>My six-year-old and I staggered to the car early this morning for the meteor shower and it was great but too much ground light for many meteors to be visible.  All the same, Heron was very excited by each one he spotted.  We watched them from a large parking lot for a closed Ames store and the only other people around were truck drivers and day laborers waiting for work and I'm sure they thought we were nuts out there jumping up and down in snow boots, heavy coats and pajamas, hooting at the sky.  <br/>
