What makes you think I'm not?  Letterboxing endeavours have taken <br/>
over my life!  It's beginning to feel like a full-time job!  But <br/>
alas, my efforts have largely been unappreciated to date--mostly <br/>
because few even know about them.<br/>

Brain appears to be going astray?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Letterboxing endeavours have taken over my life!  It's beginning to <br/>

<br/>
Ah, the fever has set in. I will be trading in my full-time(?) job <br/>
for LetterBoxing next April %^)  Although those sitting around me <br/>
wonder if I haven't already retired.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But alas, my efforts have largely been unappreciated to date--<br/>
&gt;mostly because few even know about them.<br/>

Aren't the clues on LB.org?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But I've got some surprises in the works.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>

I didn't say anything about clues....  Just <br/>
letterboxing 'endeavours'.  It's a surprise, though, and still in the <br/>
works.  Top secret stuff.  If I say more, I'd have to kill you.  <br/>
