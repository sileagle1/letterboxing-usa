                    <div class="plaintext-content">I didn't have a lot of time for boxing in Pennsylvania, but the <br/>
couple I did look for gave me severe headaches.  I have no idea if I <br/>
was just tired or reading the clues cross-eyed...  I can't really <br/>
question if the boxes are missing, because I don't think I ever <br/>
really found the places where they would have been.<br/>
<br/>
Winahawcawchunk -- Eventually I ended up at the right part of the <br/>
park (at 1638 River Road), but it didn't really matter as I was lost <br/>
from there...  I'm still not sure I had the right place, although the <br/>
man I spoke with assured me the address was correct.  83 degrees -- <br/>
from where?  The silver god maybe?  Well seeing as how I never found <br/>
him, the 83 degrees went nowhere.  I did find a bridge, but it wasn't <br/>
11 degrees from anything and didn't head south on either end.  I <br/>
walked around at both ends looking for the Big Bird's perch and felt <br/>
as cotton headed as Burt and Ernie...  Tried this one several times <br/>
from different perspectives...  finally I got a headache and gave up.<br/>
<br/>
Bowman's Hill -- This wildflower preserve is a beautiful place with <br/>
lots of great, scenic trails -- too bad the hunt for the letterbox <br/>
doesn't take advantage of them.  After paying my $5 admission fee, I <br/>
actually enjoyed running around in circles learning about the <br/>
varieties of trees, and realized this part of the hunt was necessary <br/>
for the latter part.  I wasn't too thrilled when I realized the <br/>
trailhead for the second phase was on the complete opposite end of <br/>
where I was and there was no drivable road to get there.  So I did <br/>
the walk and then set out on the hike...  (it gets worse).  So what <br/>
is "WEIR"?  Is this like a typo or an abbreviation or what?  I <br/>
figured it would make sense when I got there, but I walked the entire <br/>
length of the fence (how would I know where 1/4 way is without doing <br/>
the whole thing?), ending up back at River Road and never found <br/>
anything that would correspond to "WEIR".  So I went back to the <br/>
beginning of the fence row and did it all over again, watching for a <br/>
blue blazed trail on my right...  I found a blue blazed tree about <br/>
the distance off the path that it should be, but there wasn't really <br/>
a trail going up the hill there, and there was only 1 blue blaze, not <br/>
2.  But I tried anyway, thinking it might all fall into place if I <br/>
just followed the clues line by line.  I couldn't for the life of me <br/>
figure out how to use the tree names to derive my compass bearings <br/>
and paces, etc.  At one point the [tree name] - [tree name] - [tree <br/>
name] gave me a negative number and since my compass doesn't do <br/>
negative numbers, I got ornery, but went in the direction of the <br/>
corresponding positive number -- which didn't take me to anything I <br/>
was supposed to find.  I'm doubtful that I was even in the right <br/>
place!  Finally it was getting dark and I was still like 2 miles out <br/>
in the woods, so I turned around and went back.  Some indication as <br/>
to time, distance and level of difficulty would have been appreciated <br/>
on this one!<br/>
<br/>
As I spent so much time on these two boxes, I never made it to the <br/>
others on my agenda.<br/>
<br/>
On a brighter note, I placed a box while in PA -- in Lancaster <br/>
County.  It is kind of a fun one and would be a great Autumn <br/>
afternoon adventure.  Clues to follow later today or tomorrow.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually I did look the word up in the dictionary before setting out <br/>
and it seemed logical.  Only when I did not encounter such a landmark <br/>
in my entire journey along the fence, beginning to end, did I wonder <br/>
if perhaps it was meant to be something else, an abbreviation of some <br/>
sort.  I did note that my path never crossed over to the other side <br/>
of the fence as the map indicated I would -- perhaps that is where I <br/>
ran into problems?<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the bearings and paces in the first part of the clue <br/>
were all right on.  The second part, when I did not encounter <br/>
a "weir" gave me the problems.  And then trying to just work into the <br/>
third phase (after finding the "weir") also did not seem to make <br/>
sense (i.e. arriving at negative compass readings when doing the <br/>
indicated computations).<br/>
<br/>
As for distance and time...  no it is certainly not a drive-by, which <br/>
by the way, are not my favorite boxes (I like the ones where I need <br/>
to figure stuff out), but also IMO not a short distance or time (I <br/>
was at the preserve approximately 3 1/2 hours) and a quite confusing <br/>
set of clues.  Granted, I have only found 38 boxes and am not an <br/>
expert, but using those as comparison, this one was certainly far <br/>
beyond as far as clue difficulty.<br/>
<br/>
And there is a place for those, there are some who actually prefer <br/>
those.  My intention was not to say it is a bad set of clues, only to <br/>
express my frustration with my experience.  As for "better luck next <br/>
time"  thanks, but don't think there will be a next time.  I like a <br/>
challenge, but not that kind.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the response though, and best of luck to future searchers <br/>
of the box!<br/>

<div>Deb,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I found the Bowman's Hill box back in May and I 
have to say it was harder than I expected.  It took me two trips before I 
actually found the box and based on the log book that was a low number.  I 
remember reading that some people found it after 5 trips.  While we knew 
what the "weir" was, I'm not sure it really helped with the distance....  I 
will agree with Todd that while the clues may be a little difficult, they are 
accurate.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As for the Winahawcawchunk box, this one is much 
shorter and easier than the Bowman Hill box.  We also found this box in May 
(while we were looking for the Bowman's Hill box).  It sounds like you were 
at the right address.  My only help is to read all the signs for help 
identifying the "silver god".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope you will try finding these boxes again 
sometime in the future,</div>

once you "get" it.  I have an idea where I messed up and thus the <br/>

sure about the Washington's Crossing one.  Also it seemed like it was <br/>

I received e-mails from a couple of other people expressing <br/>
frustration with one / both of these boxes for very much the same <br/>
reasons, so I feel a little better to know it's not just me ;-)<br/>

When I get back to PA I may try again, maybe not.  Would like try <br/>
some others and get a chance to see new places.  We'll see, I am not <br/>
planning to be back there any time in the near future.<br/>

the box and based on the log book that was a low number.  I remember <br/>
reading that some people found it after 5 trips.  While we knew what <br/>

I will agree with Todd that while the clues may be a little <br/>

than the Bowman Hill box.  We also found this box in May (while we <br/>
were looking for the Bowman's Hill box).  It sounds like you were at <br/>
the right address.  My only help is to read all the signs for help <br/>
identifying the "silver god".<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! I have to say that I didn't intend for the Bowman's hill box to<br/>
be <br/>
really difficult but I did want it to be different. Sometimes it is <br/>
difficult to guage the difficulty of ones own clues.  Most of my<br/>
boxes <br/>
are pretty easy with a couple of exceptions.  It took almost a year<br/>
for <br/>
someone to find the one box intended to be difficult and I think that <br/>
so far it has been visited twice in just over two years.  I think<br/>
that <br/>
box along with the one we hid in North Dakota may be the least<br/>
visited <br/>
boxes out there but for different reasons (Has anyone found the NoDak <br/>
box?). I had in mind some ideas for one or two really difficult <br/>
historical boxes in NJ and PA  but we moved before I planted them.  <br/>
Maybe if we ever get back there...<br/>
<br/>
 There was one box that was close to us  in NJ when we lived there<br/>
that <br/>
we tried to find 3 times to find but gave up.  We knew we were close <br/>
but no joy.  I never heard anyone else have difficulty with that <br/>
particular box so I kept my mouth shut :)  Five visits to find a box<br/>
is <br/>
heroic and I salute that sort of perserverence.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I am trying to increase the couunt of SF bay area boxes.  Watch <br/>
this space.   <br/>
