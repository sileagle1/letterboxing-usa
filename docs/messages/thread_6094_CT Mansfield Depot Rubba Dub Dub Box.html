<div>I don't know what is wrong with us but we 
went out again tonight and still could not find the box! Someone wrote that they 
found it just last week. We have an idea of what we might have done wrong the 
first time because the white trail splits at one point but we didn't find it 
again tonight. We thought we had gone far enough (pedometer on hip) BUT all the 
same maybe we did not go far enough because it is posted "Caution Pesticides In 
Use" and something about not going into that area. We chose to turn back. Maybe 
we will try again in the fall.  Sorry I missed it.  All the same we love 
the beautiful walk. We saw all kinds of wild life! My four-year-old is sure that 
one of the deer that leapt in front of us was Comet on his way to report to 
Santa that she is a good girl! Too cute!</div></body></html>
