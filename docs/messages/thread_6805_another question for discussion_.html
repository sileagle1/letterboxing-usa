                    <html><body>I was wondering how people felt about stamps being specific to where they are placed...<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone feel strongly about this?  So far, I think only one of the stamps I found was not really specific to it's location.  Out of the boxes I have placed, three are very specific, one is generally related and the last is my hitchhiker which is a kangaroo.   Last I checked, kangaroos are not necessarily indigenous to Maryland, but I loved how the stamp turned out!<br/>
<br/>
I just carved a stamp of an aquarium fish - can't think where I could place it where it would make sense!  Maybe I could hide it IN an aquarium... now that might be fun!  hmmm....<br/>
<br/>
So, just wondering if it's good form to put random stamps in a box...<br/>
