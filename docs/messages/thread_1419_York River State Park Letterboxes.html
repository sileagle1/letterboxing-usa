<div>Hello!</div>
<div>    One of Squirrel's York River 
State Park boxes was visited by a WHOM (Whole Herd Of Magnants) over the 
weekend.  What a nice park! After last weekend I decided to take away my 
wifes excuse for staying home. I purchased an Evenflo Trail Blazer (back pack 
style baby carrier).  I highly recommend this thing to anyone with a 
baby.  It's a must have for the baby on the go. It is so comfortable 
to wear! It adjusts so that all the weight is carried on your hips. It must be 
comfortable for the baby too because Lindsay always falls asleep in it.  
Anyway, my wife was working but it was such a beautiful day that I decided 
to put the Trail Blazer to the big test. So we headed to York River 
State park.  We only had time to find Letterbox #2.  It took me a bit 
longer to get up there than I had planned. When we arrived we had to find 
the potties. Then I had to feed my 5 month old daughter. Then with only an 
hour and a half until dark, I didn't dare tackle the 1.75 mile Taskinas 
Creek Trail.  Have I mentioned that 3 year old triplets stop 
to look at everything!  We checked out the playground for a while and 
then we found Letterbox #2 with no problems. In fact I thought it was showing 
through the cracks of the platform a bit too much. I added a thin layer of dirt 
and leaves to the top of the box to hide it a bit better.  </div>
<div>    FYI, the last Saturday 
in October should be a great day for visiting York River State Park.  
Harvest Day Festival is October 28th from 12:00 to 4:00.  They will have 
Hay Rides Sat afternoon, a guided canoe trip late afternoon, and a campfire Sat 
evening. For more information call 757-566-3036.  The park will be closed 
to the public for controlled deer management hunts on the following days: 
November 6, 7, 8 and December 9, 11,12,13.</div>
<div>    Our next adventure will be to 
hide our first box! Can't wait to tell you all about it!</div>
