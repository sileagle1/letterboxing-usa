Holidays tonight in Herndon (5-8pm), look for us for a personal stamp <br/>
exchange!  We're all wearing red/reddish tops and will have volunteer <br/>
sweatshirts, because we're lighting candles.  I have my hair up in a bun <br/>
(sort of) and am wearing penguin earrings and black pants with a tan <br/>
geometric print.<br/>
<br/>
If you weren't already planning to come, join us!  It's free, there are <br/>
snacks, and there's music and lots of fun stuff to do, for kids in <br/>
particular.  Lots of parking.  And there's partial coverage in case it <br/>
rains.  Near the intersection of 606/Elden/Centreville &amp; 267/Dulles Toll <br/>
Road.<br/>
<br/>
Was hoping to make a special stamp for the occasion, but didn't have <br/>
time :-&lt;  Maybe next year.  Hope to see at least one of you!<br/>
