                    <div class="plaintext-content">Myself(Dan) &amp; Robin(my wife) started letterboxing in August of this year (the NeeDeeps Lenny &amp; Kathy got us into letterboxing).  We had a great time looking for the Ants Go Marching On (7 out of 10, missed 6,7,8) and Chuck's 6 box series all day yesterday(11/2/02).  It was cold and windy by the water but, it was a great time.  Find a couple of extra letterboxes the Troll and EMS Letterbox.  We are hoping to put boxes out when we get comfortable with everything.  I've been reading the messages left on the news board and think everyone is very nice and helpfull.  It's been nice posting on here and will continue to do so; Dan &amp; Robin <br/>
