&gt; one somewhere and I didn't find it.<br/>
&lt;--- snip ---&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are there any "rules" for classifying a box?<br/>
<br/>
Nope, no rules at all, with long and serious debates having taken place in<br/>
the past over this very topic.  Matter of fact, it's what prompted me to<br/>
create the LbRS (Letterbox Rating System) which was designed to give, at<br/>
quick glance, the relative 'easiness' of a letterbox.  And it solely rests<br/>
with the owner of that box to rate it, not someone else.  And by no means<br/>
is it meant to be the definitive answer to rating the easiness of a<br/>
letterbox at all, just another tool.<br/>
<br/>
I personally try to be as forgiving as I can when I tell someone how easy<br/>
or hard my boxes are.  I'd rather tell someone that they are difficult and<br/>
then have them tell me it was easy than the other way around.<br/>
