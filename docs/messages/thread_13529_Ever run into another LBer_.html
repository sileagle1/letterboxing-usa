Most recently last Saturday when we were leaving Wanda and Petes "2 years and 2000 lbs" we saw a couple with "papers" in hand.  Are you Letterboxing? asked, turned out they were, they were Zia from CT. They had thought my license plate reminded them of Letterboxing  because the letters were close.<br/>

Nice to meet other people any time.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Meeting other letterboxers probably does happen more often here in Connecticut. We have met several in the last couple weeks. To take some of the mystery out of it, I wear a fishing vest instead of a backpack. I have the LBNA Patch and a pin I made up on the vest. My Jeep has small but readable signs on the rear side windows, "Chuck and Molly Letterboxing Team" and my license plate is my last name. Having this on my car did get us some exchanges. The most unusual was from a fellow letterboxer that parked next to us at the Mansfield McDonalds, saw the sign and luckely spoke up. The most recent was a couple days ago when another car pulled up next to us at a parking area for a box. They also spoke up first and we got to meet some more boxers. Meeeting people at the box itself has happened but only once or twice. Not very often...Chuck and Molly P77F433X131<br/>

I'm glad we met though, because it led to some fun boxing adventures and<br/>

Working at the arboretum for two weeks !<br/>
What a great place to hide some letterboxes on my lunch break !<br/>
Hide 5 letterboxes the first week ,post the clues ....then wait , wait ,<br/>
wait .<br/>
Someone said: <br/>
If you hide them ,they will come ...Hummm<br/>
Finally ....people walking in the <br/>
arboretum ! <br/>
No ..No clue sheets,no compass,no lost looks on their faces ..darn not<br/>
boxing .<br/>
<br/>
Again people hiking going past me ...not boxing ....Darn .<br/>
<br/>
Finally ! Two young  ladies walking in the tracks of the clues ! <br/>
Paper (notebooks) in hand ,<br/>
compass, heads down looking at the ground ..<br/>
Definite signs of  LETTERBOXING !!  <br/>
Oh JOY !!<br/>
<br/>
I kind of stood back and watched them for a while .(it was entertaining<br/>
)<br/>
Then I couldn't wait to meet them and talk about letterboxing !<br/>
Now I have <br/>
Two new letterboxing friends !!<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 cents ....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've never officially run into another letterboxer on the trails.  <br/>
But, one time, when I was checking on my own boxes on Pyramid Mt. I <br/>
passed a couple hiking.  For some reason, they struck me as boxers, <br/>
but I didn't say anything, I kept on my way.  I then ran into another <br/>
couple, and I knew they were looking for boxes, but again I didn't <br/>
say anything.  I had been hiking all day (at that time it was <br/>
possible to check all my boxes in one day &amp; still look for other <br/>
folk's boxes) and I was tired and just wanted to go home.<br/>
A couple days later, reading this board I saw that Forester met up <br/>
with (I can't for the life of me remember the names of the folks that <br/>
planted the Weiss Ecology box &amp; several others in NJ) a couple <br/>
searching for the Pyramid Mt. series on the day I was there.  I'm <br/>
positive I passed both couples.  <br/>
That was the closest I've actually come to meeting other boxers, but <br/>
who knows what the future will bring... <br/>
