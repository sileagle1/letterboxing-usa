</p><p>Cool name! Letterboxers here in CT almost always insert a description of what Letterboxing is all about in a baggie in their boxes so the uninformed understand what they have come upon. You can find this on the LBNA site. 
</p><p>Also, IMHO, discretion when stamping in can help avoid bringing attention to any letterbox, though I can understand that in urban areas that might be difficult to do. I guess it is logical that the smaller and less obtrusive the container is, the easier it is to conceal it in its hiding place as well as while stamping in. Too bad Rubbermaid doesn't offer more "natural" colors (forest green?, beige? etc.) n place of the translucent containers with blue lids that many of us use. 
</p><p>Welcome to letterboxing, by the way. You didn't mention where you hail from.

I just found some really cute containers at the local Rite Aid drugs <br/>
(for $1.25 each) They are small boxes and come in white, and many <br/>
other colors---I bought out the green and orange ones!!  I used the <br/>
Orange ones to hide boxes in the Virginia area just recently and I <br/>
discovered that they camouflaged quite nicely with the red clay and <br/>
dead leaves!  I plan to use the green ones in areas in the Pacific <br/>
Northwest with lots of mossy green logs and evergreen firs!<br/>
<br/>
Don and Gwen of California use colored duct tape to cover their boxes <br/>
to match the area they are hidden!  I found a box of theirs that was <br/>
hidden in a rotted log. The box was covered with a beigy-brown tape <br/>
that totally matched the color of the rotten wood!!  They have an <br/>
urban box that they used the silver duct tape on---so the box blends <br/>
in with the concrete area where it is hidden.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, urban boxes have a higher mortality rate.  Basically it comes down to <br/>
how much traffic the location has.  The more traffic, the more likely I box <br/>
is to be discovered by a non-boxer, and as such a higher risk of <br/>
disappearance.  Where as a box on the peak of Mt Foo is more likely to <br/>
survive because not as many people tromp around up there.  Then of course <br/>
there are acts of nature to contend with.... floods, raccoons, etc.  It's <br/>
all a part of the adventure.<br/>
<br/>
I've have 3 boxes go missing... one was blatantly vandilized and the other <br/>
two just disappeared.  It was quite a bummer as I didn't see any of the <br/>
logs.  The 2 that disappeared were part of a series of 3 (Snoqualmie Falls), <br/>
so I took the one remaining log home and scanned all the pages into my PC so <br/>
as to have a personal archive (I returned the log the next day).<br/>
<br/>
I check my boxes as often as I can... but not nearly as often as I like.  I <br/>
particularly like when I hear that someone has been to one of my boxes.  <br/>
That way I know it's still there and seeing activity.  =)<br/>

I've just been lurking a little while, but I've already seen something that <br/>
I was sort of expecting. In urban areas, letterboxes seem to disappear <br/>
rather often. Does anyone have any tips for long-lived 'boxes? Is there <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI hedge hog,  we keep the original clues for all of our boxes at home...that <br/>
way we can give someone a copy if they are interested in trying out the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Some of our urban boxes have lasted a while and some are very short lived.    <br/>
My best tip would be "hide it well!"   Also, choose areas of the park that <br/>
are not well groomed.   Our smaller boxes have lasted the longest.  We have <br/>
had one box, however, in the middle of a park that has lasted a couple years <br/>
with no problem but it is in a hole in a tree.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>

Happy Hunting,<br/>
