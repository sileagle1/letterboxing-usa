                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all. This is my first time posting on this group, but I've been a member for a while. <br/>
<br/>
I found my first box of the year yesterday. I know it's ok to box in the winter, but I just didn't have the time and energy to give to it this winter. So, I started up with "New England Leaf", a nice easy find. It was a beautiful chill day and the Lake looked great through the trees. <br/>
<br/>
I also have a question. My 9 yr old step son has expressed interest in having his own trail name and stamp. I told him I'd think about it, but I wanted to know, is there an "appropriate" age to do this? He has his wittling chip for cub scouts and I know there's a navigation badge that he could get with the compass work. We'd never let him go searching on his own, but I'm wondering what everyone thinks about age for a kid to start their own logbook and trailname and such. <br/>
<br/>
Thanx for any input. Have a great day! :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many kids get their trail names at birth!  I definitely would let any kid<br/>
age 4 and older have their own logbook and stamp if they wanted.  They<br/>
usually are much more interested if they have "their own" stuff.  Someone<br/>
else can carve a stamp for them if they are too young to carve.  However I<br/>
know of kids as young as 6 years old that have carved stamps. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that you should try to conserve space when stamping into box<br/>
logbooks.  Signature stamps should generally be small and it's good if your<br/>
family can all stamp in on a single page (or as few pages as possible).<br/>

Hi all. This is my first time posting on this group, but I've been a member<br/>
for a while. <br/>
<br/>

winter, but I just didn't have the time and energy to give to it this<br/>
winter. So, I started up with "New England Leaf", a nice easy find. It was a<br/>
beautiful chill day and the Lake looked great through the trees. <br/>
<br/>

wittling chip for cub scouts and I know there's a navigation badge that he<br/>
could get with the compass work. We'd never let him go searching on his own,<br/>
but I'm wondering what everyone thinks about age for a kid to start their<br/>
own logbook and trailname and such. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm Hansenclan, and collectively, our family is Hansenclan -- but our kids have had their own stamps and trailnames for the past year (commencing at ages 9 &amp; 11).  Online... we're just Hansenclan... but in logbooks, I stamp-in at the top of the page, and then after my comments, write:  "and the Hansenclan kids:"  and leave room for both of them to stamp-in below.  Someday, if we can ever convince my hubby to have any enthusiasm about letterboxing, I (or he) will carve a stamp for him, and he will be "WaterLossGuy" -- he works for a water utility company, Water Loss was the theme of his research project in college, and so that's what his classmates nicknamed him.<br/>
<br/>
So -- yes -- my kids have letterboxing identities of their own, but not online.  (Oh, and yes -- they each have their own logbook now, too.)  Hope this helps!<br/>
