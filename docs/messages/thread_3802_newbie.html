happy to have a new member who hides as well as seeks.  Just a <br/>
reminder to all newbies: Remember when posting your clues to the talk <br/>
list to put the state abbreviation in the subject line.  "New ID <br/>
letterbox..." for example.  This will greatly help people who are <br/>
searching for new letterbox clues.  I live in Massachusetts, and with <br/>
the number of posts entered on this site, to save time I would just <br/>
pass by any new listings that are not in my geographical area.  <br/>
Seeing the state abbreviation in the subject line is a great time <br/>
saver.<br/>

box to log your find, but as far as I know there is no way to see all your<br/>
finds together on a single page.<br/>
if you log them on atlasquest,you will be able to see boxes registered with<br/>
AQ unless you become a premium member($35/yr) and then you can track all<br/>
your finds, even non aq boxes.<br/>

ALWAYS double-check the on-line clues before you head out for a particular letterbox, or the box you seek may not be where you look.<br/>

<br/>
Both letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com allow you to do that. On letterboxing.org <br/>
, click on the green flag. After entering the date you found the  <br/>
letterbox, you'll have an opportunity to send a private note to the  <br/>
clue owner ("Contact the Placer"). On atlasquest.com, each clue page  <br/>
has a Record Find button and there is a Record Find option under the  <br/>
Letterbox menu. When recording a find on AQ, you have the option a  <br/>
leaving a private or public message. The public message option is most  <br/>
like the geocaching.com logging option.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, you might want to join the Newboxers group: newboxers. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
