Granny Austin's Tavern<br/>
<br/>
Here's an easy 1 mile, level hike in undeveloped Red Cedar Lake State<br/>
Park in Lebanon, CT. Bring the kids! Directions: from CT Rte. 11, take<br/>
exit 22 and turn south off the ramp. The road will soon fork: branch<br/>
right onto Scott Hill Rd and drive 1.2 miles to an unmarked pole-gate<br/>
on the right where the road turns sharply left.<br/>
<br/>
Park here and hike northwest through the gate up the trail. Shortly<br/>
pass a side trail on the left, which goes down to a view of the lake<br/>
and a small island. Note a little peninsula off to the right with a<br/>
stand of pines right up to the water. Returning to the main trail,<br/>
continue to the ruins of Granny Austin's Tavern, with a classic center<br/>
chimney beehive oven and a well (careful, kids!). In colonial days the<br/>
fields would have been cleared and there would be a good view of the<br/>
lake and the island. Continuing, pass a mess that hopefully will be<br/>
cleaned up, then fork left. Shortly fork left a second time and pass<br/>
more messy remains of an old campground to the lakeshore.<br/>
<br/>
On a pleasantly open peninsula, enjoy the view and perhaps a swim.<br/>
Working down through the mountain laurel to the southwest corner of the<br/>
point, near the shore, find your reward on the ground under a rock in a<br/>
stand of white pines. (Please cover it up with leaves and small<br/>
branches to hide it a little from others).<br/>
<br/>
Now you can return the way you came, or, extend your hike another<br/>
half-mile along the lake. It's level and easy to follow, with more<br/>
campground ruins (some quite extensive), and an interesting dam at the<br/>
end of the lake (to find the dam, turn left at the trail's end onto the<br/>
road and follow south a short way).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy, Jay and kids<br/>
