                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, I'm a geocacher that stumbled on a letterbox today in hope falls <br/>
ny. I'm trying to find the owner so I can ask them if they would like <br/>
to combine there letterbox with my geocache which is only about 100 <br/>
feet away. I have some room in my square lock n lock and what I feel <br/>
is a better hidding spot. The last person to put this back didn't do a <br/>
good job and the bark slabs slid down and the letterbox slid out. I'm <br/>
afraid that if it remains in this location that it will eventually be <br/>
muggled. How do I find the owner? I tried letterboxing.org but that is <br/>
obviously not an option anymore. I'm eventually going to get into some <br/>
light letterboxing but I will be mainly sticking with geocaching and <br/>
geocaching hybrids. Also I have a few pink pearl erasers that I've <br/>
been experimenting with but am unhappy with the results. Are there any <br/>
tips or tricks that you guys can give me? How to create designs and <br/>
what not. Thanx for your assistance. Swizzle<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing.org is temporarily offline, but I'm sure they will have it back<br/>
as quickly as they can.  Apparently we outgrew it!  You can try looking for<br/>
the box at www.atlasquest.com and track its owner that way, or you can post<br/>
the name of it here and announce you are looking for the owner.  If the<br/>
owner doesn't answer, at leats maybe someone will know something about the<br/>
owner and can either get in touch with them or tell you how.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
