Fort Tuthill Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: March 17, 2004<br/>
State:  Arizona<br/>
County:   Coconino<br/>
Nearest city:  Flagstaff<br/>
Difficulty:   Walk &amp; clues  easy<br/>
Walk time: about 20 minutes one way<br/>
<br/>
The box is in Fort Tuthill County Park on the southern edge of <br/>
Flagstaff.  From I-17 take Exit 337 and drive west a very short <br/>
distance to Beulah Blvd.  Go north on Beulah a very short distance <br/>
and turn west into Fort Tuthill County Park on the entrance road <br/>
that has the brown "fairgrounds" sign.  Drive straight to end of <br/>
paved road and park in trailhead lot.<br/>
<br/>
Walk north on the Urban Trail (starts next to the trailhead lot) <br/>
which is a wide raised cinder &amp; gravel trail that is an abandoned <br/>
railroad grade.  It was a logging railroad constructed starting in <br/>
1902 by the Arizona Lumber and Timber Company and closed down in <br/>
1966.   You will walk past stables on your right.  After crossing a <br/>
dirt road with wood railings, you will see a trail sign and map on <br/>
your left for the Soldiers Trail.  Go west on Soldiers Trail which <br/>
starts behind the sign.  Follow the green narrow trail markers with <br/>
arrows on them.  After the 4th green trail marker, the trail starts <br/>
uphill.  It then approaches a barbwire fence.  There is an old short <br/>
2-feet-high tree stump next to the fence.  Seven paces west is a <br/>
large live pine tree.  From the red &amp; white fence post next to this <br/>
tree go off trail west along the fence line counting the fence posts <br/>
as you go.  The box is at the 10th fence post about 3 feet south <br/>
under some rocks.  Be alert for snakes.<br/>
