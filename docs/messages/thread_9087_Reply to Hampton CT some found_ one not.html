                    <html><body><p>Went to Trailwoods Back Door today. From your post, I was sure you had the right spot. The box is still there. I  found that those that did find it also had a tough time. I believe that you must have been on the wrong wall. At the corner of the walls, it is back about a foot or so on the wall you followed. You just have to move two small flat rocks to find it. You might want to hold off on this one. I am going to check all my directions and perhaps move it even a bit further up "the major trail". I will also be posting an adopted letterbox in Hampton. You were with in 20-30 yards of it yesterday. I wanted to be sure it was abandoned first. .....Chuck and Molly
