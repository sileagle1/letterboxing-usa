- You are arriving at 10:00am, expect others at ?<br/>

us from severe thunderstorms?  I am hoping it won't rain until <br/>
afternoon. :-)<br/>

impromptu meetings of diverse people and kids.  (Is that why I have a <br/>

- What else is on the agenda?  Not that we need one besides: <br/>
greetings, recognitions, surprised exclamations, exchanges, story <br/>

Most Honorable Scarab - I confess it is sort of loose and you have made some <br/>
excellent points.  Right now, as far as I know, the plan is just to meet at <br/>
the pavilion at Riverbend Park and exchange and the Happy Homeschoolers are <br/>
bringing a HH basket.  I am bringing tortilla wrap sandwiches, I assume others are <br/>
still bringing food.<br/>
<br/>
weather.com says it'll start raining about noon and not get heavy till the <br/>
afternoon.  If we need it, Tyson's food court would be a great back up.<br/>
