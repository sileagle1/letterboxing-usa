                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have had to make some corrections to two of our letterboxes at<br/>
Myles Standish State Forest.  The "Bridge to Nowhere" LB had an<br/>
incorrect compass heading (woops!), and although a couple of people<br/>
found it anyway, it has been corrected.  The Edaville RR letterbox had<br/>
to be moved because of fire road clearing that went on this winter and<br/>
spring.  Amazingly, our letterbox was still intact in an area of<br/>
downed trees that extended for at least 1/2 mile --- Would you believe<br/>
that the distinctive tree that we had hidden it next to was the ONLY<br/>
log left in the area, and there was the box still safely hidden next<br/>
to it, almost as if those doing the cutting found it and rehid it for<br/>
us.  For once the letterboxing spirits were with us!<br/>
