find some boxes today.... or attempt to anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I started out at Paddle to the Sea, since Butterfly already had it, which was <br/>
alive and well!  We also visited Falling Stars and You Otter See This, which <br/>
were fine.<br/>
<br/>
Then we went out in search of Neverland, and true to the name of the box.... <br/>
we NEVER (get it?) found it!  We found lots of black circles, but no box.....  <br/>
Then we went out to Windham Jail Break, which we found alive and well.  We <br/>
would have gone to Windham Center School, however, school was in session.<br/>
<br/>
Then we ventured out to Willimantic to find the Falling Leaves box.  We did <br/>
well for the first two lines of the clues, but never found the yellowish <br/>
building.  (There was an orangish outhouse in the community garden, but it was clear <br/>
up the hill from the river).  We pretty much checked every five trunked tree <br/>
in the place, but to no avail.... (sigh).<br/>
<br/>
We then decided to go to the Lily Pad and spend some money (and have <br/>
Butterfly stamp into the box!).  Much to our pleasant surprise, they are having a 30% <br/>
off sale on general merchandise!!!!!  (GO STOCK UP NOW EVERYONE!)<br/>
<br/>
THen, we decided to call it quits and go home.  I went and checked on all of <br/>
the Meshomasic State Forest letterboxes, and then, when I found out my <br/>
saxophone student wasn't coming for a lesson tonight, decided to head out to the <br/>
South Windsor Wildlife Sanctuary, Rockville Spur, and Riverfront Letterbox (E <br/>
Hartford).  They were all present and accounted for, and there is a little <br/>
surprise in the Rockville Spur box.... my question to Bill and Craig is.... can I use <br/>
it for the actual golf course and not merchandise??????????  :-) ?<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone else had a more boxious day than we did!  I also hope that the <br/>
rain holds off on Sat. like it did today so we can stay dry at the gather in <br/>
Mansfield!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
