                    <div class="plaintext-content">I believe that all the racers have now been picked up from their <br/>
starting boxes. Most of the drivers have contacted me to let me know <br/>
what's going on, but one or two haven't. So:<br/>
<br/>
To encourage communication from drivers of the racers, I have added <br/>
the Carrier Pigeon PLB, which will be offered to letterboxers who <br/>
pick up a racer AND contact me to let me know about it... This helps <br/>
to prevent others from hunting a racer in vain, and also gives each <br/>
racer the best chance of winning once they do get to the next box, so <br/>
other letterboxers can grab 'em...<br/>
<br/>
Also, it is the best way for me to keep track of each racer's <br/>
drivers. I need your trail names and email addresses, so when your <br/>
racer crosses the finish line you can all get your trophy stamps and <br/>
what not :)  <br/>
