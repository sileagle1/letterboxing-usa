&gt; I just felt compelled to set you straight, lest you be banned from <br/>
lurking<br/>
&gt; and your computer refuse to open any Letter Box clue sheets. Any <br/>
further<br/>
&gt; transgressions may be met with a stealth virus that formats your <br/>
hard drive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; X marks the Spot and I have formed our own vigilante group to deal <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; 'boxers' that don't measure up.<br/>
&gt; Attached is a video that demonstrates what I mean.<br/>
&gt; Be careful, this could happen to you!<br/>
&gt; Trial-n-Error<br/>
