North Elba, NY<br/>

<br/>
Heart Lake is a gem in the High Peaks Region of the Adirondack <br/>
Mountains, near Lake Placid. This lake earns its name on many levels. <br/>
Seen on a topographic map, the lake tends to appear as a rather <br/>
anatomically correct heart. However, from other views, especially <br/>
atop some of the nearby mountains, it looks like a valentine. If you <br/>
concentrate, you can make out this shape from the lakeshore. Heart <br/>
Lake is also considered by many to be at the spiritual heart of the <br/>
Adirondacks.<br/>
<br/>
Heart Lake is on the Adirondak Loj property owned by the Adirondack <br/>
Mountain Club. Non-members are welcome. The Loj has overnight <br/>
accommodations available for up to 46 people in private rooms, family <br/>
bunkrooms, and a coed bunkroom. There is also a campground on the <br/>
property, with tent sites, canvas platform tents, and lean-tos <br/>
(sorry, no RV facilities). There is a fee for day use, with plenty of <br/>
parking, an information center, rest rooms and coin showers, a small <br/>
store, and a beach for swimming in the lake. You can look up fees and <br/>
reservations arrangements at www.adk.org or call 518-523-3441.<br/>
<br/>
An almost endless array of trails leave directly from this area. <br/>
Shorter hikes include the unnamed trail that goes about a mile around <br/>
the lake and the 2-mile loop trail over little Mt. Jo. Some <br/>
intermediate hikes are available.  Those wishing a strenuous day hike <br/>
can scale some of New York's 46 high peaks over 4000-feet<br/>
elevation, <br/>
including the state high point, Mt. Marcy at 5344 feet. Extended <br/>
wilderness backpacking trips can be planned as well. The High Peaks <br/>
Information Center is on the grounds, and guidebooks and maps can be <br/>
purchased in advance at outdoors stores or by contacting the <br/>
Adirondack Mountain Club (ADK) at the website above.<br/>

<br/>
Hiking: The letterbox is hidden on a deliberately short walk. That <br/>
way you can choose other hikes that suit you while you are here. Plan <br/>
to stay a while- it's worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: easy<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: From Interstate 87, take exit 30, Route 73 toward <br/>
Keene  and Lake Placid. Stay on Route 73 for 26.5 miles. Look <br/>
carefully for the High Peaks Trailhead sign at Adirondak Loj Road, on <br/>
the south side (left side) of Route 73. Turn down this road and go <br/>
4.8 miles. On the other hand, if you are coming from the west, take <br/>
Route 86 through Lake Placid. At the third traffic light, turn right <br/>
onto Route 73 towards Keene. Go 2.8 miles and turn right onto <br/>
Adirondak Loj Road at the High Peaks Trailhead sign. Go 4.8 miles.<br/>
<br/>
At the entrance booth, stop and explain whether you are there for day <br/>
use, overnight camping at the campground, wilderness camping, or <br/>
lodging at the Adirondak Loj. You will be told where to park <br/>
according to your use type.<br/>
