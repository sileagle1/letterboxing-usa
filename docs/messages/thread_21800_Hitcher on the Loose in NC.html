Hitcher on the Loose in NC<br/>
<br/>
After collecting 500 boxes in one month on the southern portion of her road <br/>
trip to Texas, then stopping for pleasant visits with Mountain Scorpia in NC <br/>
and the Doubtful Guests in VA, Wanda is almost back home to RI.  She'll <br/>
probably write up a trip report sometime next week.  Meanwhile, though, she <br/>
wanted me to let any interested parties know that she did drop off another <br/>
unattended hitchhiker the other day in NC, but promises not to make a habit of <br/>
it   :-) .  She just happened to be visiting the Duke University gardens off <br/>
Flower Drive in Durham, NC, where a letterbox named "Redfields Prophecy" <br/>
had once been placed by Celeste.  Not finding that box there, she still thought <br/>
the place so beautiful, especially right now with everything in bloom, that she <br/>
wanted to encourage others to come see it.  <br/>
<br/>
Scrounging around in her pack, she found that she'd already planted all the <br/>
boxes with RTRW stamps that I had brought out for her in Texas.  All she <br/>
could come up with was one micro-box hitchhiker passed along from the <br/>
Kissin' Fishes that she'd almost forgotten about.  She planted it temporarily <br/>
tucked into the corner under pine needles behind a red brick under the west <br/>
side of the arched bridge in the native plant section, near where the original <br/>
box had been.  Hope someone can rescue this little pumpkin and maybe <br/>
even put in a new box there like the folks did out in Panna Maria, TX.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
