Wow...only 2 bucks for the pink stuff..costs me 5 for a sheet!!!<br/>
<br/>
While on the subject of rubber stamps...I'm gonna state my pet peeve!!!<br/>
<br/>
I've found some beautiful carved stamps...each one no matter who makes it, <br/>
is a work of art...but, unless it's mounted on a piece of wood, is difficult <br/>
to get a great impression...<br/>
<br/>
I've tried mounting my hand carved stamps on wood and it's really easy...I <br/>
just got a piece of basswood from the art store...cut it to fit around the <br/>
stamp, and rubber cemented it on.<br/>
<br/>
It would make it easier for others to get a good impression for our <br/>
collections...<br/>

How do you cut the wood?  I used a piece of basswood to mount <br/>
several stamps but found it very difficult to cut without the proper <br/>
"machines".  Might you be able to recommend some small and <br/>
inexpensive tool that would make cutting it easy?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As for wood to mount stamps, I simply asked a carpenter I knew for some<br/>
scraps of left over wood.  Now I happen to have connections with someone who<br/>
works for a yacht maker,  so my stamps are now mounted on such things as<br/>
teak and mahogany, but I agree that a wood mount does make it easier.  I am<br/>
also going to start carrying a small piece of plywood or something in my box<br/>
to use as a mini desk,  for those boxes that have larger stamps.  I have<br/>
trouble getting good impressions with those.  I did switch from carrying an<br/>
actual log book with me to carrying sheets of paper that I later mount in an<br/>
album.  This way,  if I screw up the image I can stamp another and not have<br/>
to worry about ruining my log book.<br/>
Just an idea from a relative newbie<br/>

I just used a hand saw...sanded the edges so no one gets splinters...doesn't <br/>
have to be perfect...after all, everyone is more interested in the stamp<br/>
