<br/>
Since many boxers never get the chance to see stamps from boxers on the opposite coast, BCostley and myself have exchanged letterboxes for a few months. <br/>
<br/>
BCostley's wonderful Oregon box has been planted near Beacon Falls, New Haven County, CT and Alafair's in Hoyt Arboretum near Portland, OR. "Oregon" is a wonderfully detailed hand-carved stamp (no inkpad in the former, so please bring your own). The original was done in both green and blue inks....just perfect. The CT stamp for OR is very appropriately placed. I did include ink in my box. Both letterboxes have hand-made logbooks. <br/>
<br/>
The respective clues are in "What's New." We'd like to invite as many people as possible to come out and visit these boxes and share their stamps and  good wishes before we send them back to their respective coasts for our friends there to enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, there are two add-ons to the Oregon box in CT.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Alafair and BCostley<br/>
