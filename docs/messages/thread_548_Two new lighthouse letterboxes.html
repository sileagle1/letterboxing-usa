                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
Just got back from placing two new letterboxes in the<br/>
Door Co. Lighthouse series.  Both are located in<br/>
Bailey's Harbor, Wi, and even on the same road.  (As<br/>
Deborah may have mentioned a while back, this county<br/>
fairly gifted in lighthouses per capita.)  If anyone<br/>
is keeping track of letterbox performance, these new<br/>
boxes are the small cylindrical type with the yellow<br/>
lids that Dan'l had sent to a few of us.  I'll let you<br/>
know how well they do in a few months because they're<br/>
going to get wet, oh yes, they will get wet.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
Bailey's Harbor is located on Highway 57 in Door Co.<br/>
Wisconsin.  The starting point for both letterboxes is<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Old Bailey's Harbor Lighthouse (D.C. Lighthouse Series<br/>
#2)<br/>
Follow Ridges Rd. from Bailey's Harbor all the way to<br/>
the end.  When you can see Lake Michigan at the end of<br/>
the road, you're there.  Drive into the small parking<br/>
area and the lighthouse will be on your right.  Walk<br/>
toward the water, keeping the lighthouse on your<br/>
right.  When you reach the rocky shoreline, turn to<br/>
the right and walk toward the lighthouse.  Watch your<br/>
step as you make your way over, and you will find the<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
Difficulty: easy<br/>
Terrain: slightly rocky<br/>
<br/>
Bailey's Harbor Range Lights (D.C. Lighthouse Series<br/>
#3)<br/>
This double lighthouse is also on Ridges Rd., but<br/>
nearer the beginning than the end.  If you follow the<br/>
left hand path as you go toward the beach from the<br/>
lower range light, you will cross a wooden bridge. <br/>
Take 15 normal adult paces along this bridge and look<br/>
beneath.<br/>
Difficulty: easy<br/>
Terrain: easy<br/>
<br/>
Photos and stamp images are in the mail to Der Mad<br/>
Stamper.  I realize both these clues are easy, but I<br/>
didn't put all these lighthouses on the same road,<br/>
they did!  I'm hoping to make the next few letterboxes<br/>
more challenging.<br/>

Looks like pretty soon we'll all have enough motivation to come and check out your neck of the woods.  Thanks for including pictures, it adds a nice flavor to the page.<br/>
