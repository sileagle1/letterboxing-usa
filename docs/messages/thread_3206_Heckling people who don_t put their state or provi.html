I looked up "heckle" to make sure you weren't insulting me.  "To badger" and <br/>
"to annoy" are two of the definitions, and I guess they apply, although the <br/>
intention is to educate, not badger or annoy.<br/>
<br/>
Henceforth, I will apply the same principle to my apparently <br/>
too-often-repeated requests by putting the warning in the subject line so <br/>
you can delete before you open, just like I want to when the subject line <br/>
tells me it's about a letterbox in a remote state.<br/>

I think it's even nicer if people can go more than a few days without<br/>
reminding everyone how nice it would be to mention the state or<br/>
province in the subjuct line, and it make sure it's the first thing<br/>
in the subject line.  I think we should designate someone to post<br/>
such a warning once a month (this month is already done!) and heckle<br/>
anyone who posts such a warning more often than that.  The warning is<br/>
meant to save everyone time and trouble, but it doesn't when everyone<br/>
has to keep reading the warning all of the time!<br/>
