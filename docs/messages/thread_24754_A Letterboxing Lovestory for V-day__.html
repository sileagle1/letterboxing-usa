I don't post often, but I do read  :)<br/>

Just thought this would be an appropriate announcement for Valentines<br/>

<br/>
David (the male half of LBing Team HappilyEverAfter) proposed to me<br/>
(the female half of LBing Team HappilyEverAfter) two weeks ago and he<br/>
used letterboxing to do it!!<br/>
<br/>
Since only a few of my friends and even less of my family has been<br/>
letterboxing with us, no one seems to understand how exactly David<br/>
proposed to me, and how absolutely cute it was. They think we are crazy.<br/>
<br/>
The whole story is here: http://ringonmyfinger.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
If you love letterboxing, you'll love his proposal (i think.. I did!)<br/>

What a great story!  Sharon and I have been married for 35 years, and<br/>
I still love her immensely; can't imagine Life without her, and don't<br/>
want to have to.  Still, we do get jaded, even bored, at times.  It's<br/>
hard to keep the spark burning brightly all the time, although it's a<br/>
little easier now that the girls are all grown up and on their own. <br/>
Still, 35 together is a long time.  What's nice is seeing younger<br/>
couples starting out with all the freshness still there :-)  It sure<br/>
helps us see all the things that attracted us to each other in the<br/>
first place, and helps keep our own fire burning.  Thanks for sharing<br/>
that wonderful story!  May you live a long and happy life together,<br/>
may the inevitable sorrows and bad patches be small enough that you<br/>
can hop over them easily, and may you always find your heart's desire<br/>
in each others arms and eyes.<br/>

I don't post often, but I do read :)<br/>
<br/>
Just thought this would be an appropriate announcement for Valentines<br/>
Day and an even more appropriate place to announce it :) <br/>
<br/>
David (the male half of LBing Team HappilyEverAfter) proposed to me<br/>
(the female half of LBing Team HappilyEverAfter) two weeks ago and he<br/>
used letterboxing to do it!!<br/>
<br/>
Since only a few of my friends and even less of my family has been<br/>
letterboxing with us, no one seems to understand how exactly David<br/>
proposed to me, and how absolutely cute it was. They think we are crazy.<br/>
<br/>
The whole story is here: http://ringonmyfinger.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
If you love letterboxing, you'll love his proposal (i think.. I did!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for giving me somewhere to share something "outsiders" of<br/>
letterboxing don't understand!<br/>
