                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went up to Litchfield County today to plant a box at Campbell Falls State <br/>
Park, and much to my dismay, our state of CT must be in dire straits for money. <br/>
 I went to Haystack Mountain to find the road closed to the park, so I had to <br/>
hike in from Route 272, all the way up to the tower.  It ended up taking me 1 <br/>
1/2 hours to do the whole trip (instead of the 1/2 hour I was expecting).  <br/>
Then... after Haystack, I went up to Dennis Hill, and what do I find????  Road <br/>
closed to the park, so..... I had to hike in from the road there too.  <br/>
<br/>
I had hoped to get to New Hartford today too, but with the extra hiking, I <br/>
only had enough time to go and get my 5th DEP stamp at Nassahegon in <br/>
Burlington...<br/>
<br/>
Oh well!  At least the folks in Litchfield County have another box to hunt!  <br/>
And there's no gate to the park so it can't be closed!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting everyone!<br/>
