you can probably figure out the locale with an online map server. At<br/>
least, you can narrow it down to the street and probably make _the<br/>
educated guess_ once you're in the vicinity. <br/>
<br/>
Once in the building, the entire process is clue-based. (GPS is no<br/>
help inside.) And there probably IS a unique stamp available in the<br/>
building, although not in the final piece of the puzzle. <br/>
<br/>
I brought some of my usual gang of geocachers. (They even bought me a<br/>
GPS as a group birthday gift). They really loved the clues and puzzles<br/>
aspect. This may convince them to try more letterboxes. <br/>
