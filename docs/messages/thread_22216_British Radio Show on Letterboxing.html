<br/>
Sue &amp; I heartily recommend your listening to the British Dartmoor<br/>
letterboxing play that was suggested in an earlier post today that is<br/>
currently on the BBC website for a limited time. After listening to it<br/>
tonight, we were brought back to the wonderment of the moor and all it<br/>
has to offer.<br/>
<br/>
You can find the link on our website, as well as the link for Real<br/>
Player, which you will need in order to listen to this show on your<br/>
computer.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a love for this pastime and are curious about "how it's<br/>
done across the pond" or are interested in a trip there someday,<br/>
please take a  listen! You will note many similarities to our own<br/>
American version of this hobby.<br/>
