first started by bringing Little Piggy to her letterbox Friendship in <br/>
Pomfret.  She would like to thank Wanda &amp; Pete for dropping off the <br/>
Saving Private Piggy H.H. and for Jessie &amp; Humming Bird for stamping <br/>
it and leaving it for her.  She was very excited when she opened the <br/>
box.  She will drop it off soon.  Then when went and did the first <br/>
box of Paige's Tale, we already found box 2.  Then off to Coventry <br/>
for #500.  Call it a day and headed home.  Teach &amp; Preach, Little <br/>
Piggy, and Nappy Kitty<br/>
