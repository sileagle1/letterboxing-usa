original five boxes are all back in the cemetery.   I don't know <br/>
where JP Morgan had been visiting, but today he was back at home and <br/>
was doing well.  Only Sam Colt seems to have left for good.  Everyone <br/>
is now dry and in place. Oh yes, there is a new hiding place for <br/>
Horace Wells near the original spot.<br/>
