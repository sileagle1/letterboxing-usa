                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's a little place called Anne's Beach, near MM73.  And there lies a letterbox, called the Key Sunrise Letterbox.  Park at the first parking area, if you were driving towards Key West.  Follow the boardwalk, past one picnic area.  Then past a second one. And yes, beyond the third.  But stop at the fourth.  <br/>
<br/>
If there's anyone picnicing, why don't you wade out into the Atlantic Ocean to kill some time.  The water is warm and you can walk out quite a ways without even getting your knees wet.<br/>
<br/>
When the coast is clear, though, get back to the picnic area and stand at the top of the steps, facing towards the ocean.  To your right is a wooden pole, and the letterbox is tucked next to it, under the floor that you walk on.<br/>
<br/>
When replacing the box, be sure the magnets on the box match up with the magents on the wood--only one direction works correctly for the most solid bond!<br/>
<br/>
It'll be awhile before these clues are put on the LbNA website, but they will *eventually* make it there.  =)<br/>

<br/>
If you want to appreciate the warmth of the Florida waters, take a <br/>
dip or two in the Pacific along the west coast.  Ywwwwowwww!  You'll <br/>
never complain about the water in Florida again!  =)<br/>

I'm psyched.   No clue when I'm going to get a free weekend to go after all <br/>
this bounty, but I'm really excited to have some new boxes in the area.   <br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

P.S.   I've tried the ocean off Maine.   I can't get in above my ankles, <br/>
ever.   And usually just the wet sand under my feet is too cold for me!<br/>
