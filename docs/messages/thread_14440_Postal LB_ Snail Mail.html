Michigan, and waiting in my mailbox was an adorable little snail, who <br/>
actually didn't take too long to make his way here, despite the fact <br/>
that he was giving a lift to a certain coyote.<br/>
<br/>
I am honored to be the first recipient for Scoutdog's postal <br/>
letterbox. Will stamp up and send him on his way on Monday, although <br/>
I believe his traveling companion will be hanging around in Michigan <br/>
for a bit longer.<br/>
