                    <div class="plaintext-content">Have received a couple of "not able to find the box" reports on the <br/>
Along the Way box at Port Mahon, DE.  It has been quite some time <br/>
since I have heard of a successful find on this box.  Wondering if <br/>
there is anyone reading the list who has found this one lately, and <br/>
if so when?  Also if there is anyone in that area who found the box <br/>
previously and would be willing to check on its status, please e-<br/>
mail me off list.  Thanks!<br/>
