a great walk, and the first stamp was terrific.<br/>

</p><p>Thanks for the update on Eubrontes.  I am surprised you were able to find it at all; it had been reported missing by some and only misplaced by others a few months back.  Unfortunately, we have not been vigilant about checking up on it.  Will make an effort to get out there to replace the stamp and ink and probably relocate the entire box.  What a shame! That was the first stamp I carved.  Keep an eye out for it's replacement.
