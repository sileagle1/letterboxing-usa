We have a story teller among our geocaching friends who likes to spin a good <br/>
tale. Talk of the Naughahide hampster reminded me of one of his recent <br/>
tales.  I had imagine the beast to be bigger but now I wonder?<br/>

As Gromit and I finally found the park entrance we had to agree that it fits <br/>
the title HIDDEN PARK perfectly, so as we set out on our short hike we were <br/>
wondering if it would be A REAL CHALLENGER! The park is well groomed and <br/>
lush but immediately after you enter it you can see that the cache is hiding <br/>
in some unimproved land across the way. Whoa Did I just use the word <br/>
UNIMPROVED to describe a parcel of native California land populated with <br/>
scrub brush? I think maybe developers have programmed my brain somehow to <br/>
cause my fingers to type that word. Hope nobody took offence. Gromit likes <br/>
the natural landscape better because his nose goes into hyperdrive once we <br/>
leave the manicured lawn area and start walking on the tiny trail leading up <br/>
the hill. Wow that was a short walk. We are almost at the cache<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly I spot a grouping of plush Naughahide upholstered sofas rummaging <br/>
in the bushes up ahead. They dont notice me and Gromit approaching and the <br/>
faux leather herd continues rooting around, maybe for sasparilla seeds or <br/>
perhaps armor-all berries its hard to tell from our vantage point. I <br/>
caution Gromit to be quiet so we dont spook them. The wonderdog settles <br/>
back on his haunches and I hunch down and we watch in wonder. Its not often <br/>
you see furniture this majestic foraging in our arid landscape. I cant get <br/>
a good count on how many couches and settees make up the herd but its at <br/>
least a dozen. I see a few that would look good in the living room but Im <br/>
not a poacher so we just continue to watch these ponderous yet graceful <br/>
creatures as they slowly milled around gently rummaging in the weeds.<br/>
<br/>
continued in note...<br/>

Abruptly all the sofas froze motionless and at first I thought that they had <br/>
seen Gromit and me watching them but I was wrong. Appearing to the left side <br/>
of the herd was a pride of Adirondack chairs. It looked like an Alpha Male <br/>
with his harem of brides. They slowly slinked towards the sofas stealthily <br/>
moving to encircle them. But before they could surround them the Sofa herd <br/>
bolted and it was instant pandemonium! The Adirondack chairs abandoned their <br/>
slow approach and leapt forward Cheetah like. Although much bigger the <br/>
Naughahide sofas were clearly terrified of the predatory chairs and they <br/>
squealed in terror as they ran in a frenzy to escape. Most all did but of <br/>
course Darwin dictates that there is always a weak one in every herd and <br/>
this one was no different. It was three or four sofa-lengths behind its <br/>
fellows when the first Adirondack hit it from behind instantly knocking it <br/>
off its little three inched knurled wooden legs. Then the rest of the chairs <br/>
tore into it. Gromit dont look I yelled as all the sofa cushions were <br/>
disemboweled in the Adirondacks hurry to get at the meaty springs and <br/>
hardwood inside. Oh it was a terrible sight to behold as the chairs ate the <br/>
insides, the foldout bed frame, the thin mattress Its almost more than I <br/>
can describe. I covered Gromits eyes to spare him from having nightmares <br/>
later. Finishing their meal the band of Adirondacks loped off in search of <br/>
further prey, their carnage here complete. All that was left of the once <br/>
graceful and majestic Naughahide couch were piles of cushion stuffing <br/>
scattered here and there all around, slowly being blown first one way and <br/>
then the other by the wind, probably only fifteen or twenty feet from where <br/>
I found the cache later. So if you see all that stuffing when you visit the <br/>
cache youll know where it came from. I hope Ill recover from my emotional <br/>
scarring.<br/>
<br/>
After the savage scene we had just witnessed it was good to have a cache to <br/>
find to take our mind off it. There were no leaves on most of the bushes so <br/>
I figured wed find the cache instantly but it actually took us ten or <br/>
fifteen minutes or so. We were circling the wrong clump of vegetation <br/>
looking inward. Once we changed to the next clump over we quickly found the <br/>
cache.<br/>
There are also two follow up logs that continue from fellow cachers who <br/>
enjoyed the story at<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?ID=50901&amp;log=y&amp;decrypt=<br/>
<br/>
I think this shows that even geocachers have vivid imaginations to make the <br/>
simplest cache fun.<br/>
