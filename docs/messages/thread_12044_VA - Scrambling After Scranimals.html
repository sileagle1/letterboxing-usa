Wow -- the temperature sure has dropped since yesterday!  So, in light of <br/>
that fact and the probability that it will dip still more tomorrow -- we <br/>
took a field trip out to Burke Lake Park.<br/>
<br/>
We drove up the Toll Road to the beltway and around, only to realize that we <br/>
could have taken Fairfax County Parkway -- duh!  It would have been a lot <br/>
closer!  Oh well!<br/>
<br/>
We hadn't been to the park since Be was tiny and before Ma was even a glint <br/>
in her Daddy's eye, so, it was fun to see what's new.  It looks like they're <br/>
doing a lot of construction both to the roads and the lots.<br/>
<br/>
The wind blew off the lake and hurried us on our way.  There sure are a lot <br/>
of tattooed trees!  We sighted through the wrong ones at first, but then <br/>
found the headland and the Bananaconda!  We were glad to see him settled in <br/>
his new home.  It was fun to see our original entry in the logbook (but oh <br/>
is that handwriting bad!...)<br/>
<br/>
Even though school is out of session -- life is a learning experience 'cause <br/>
now we know what frisbee golf is! (and yesterday at another box we learned <br/>
all about cooties!)  Ducking flying disks, we followed the train tracks to <br/>
the trestle.  Had to think fast when some other moms came down the path and <br/>
wondered what I was doing crouching under a train trestle with a backpack <br/>
full of odd supplies...  Luckily they believed me when I said we were trying <br/>
to stay out of the wind...  a little harmless weather talk eases even the <br/>
most awkward social situation!<br/>
<br/>
We took a break at the playground while Mom read the rest of the clues.  <br/>
Another big duh -- yellow ladder and all....<br/>
<br/>
The Mangorilla was a little harder to find.  Is it 250 SWest? or 150 degrees <br/>
SE?  250 SE didn't make any sense (of course, I never was any good with <br/>
math...)<br/>
<br/>
After a fun respite on the playground where the BeMa kids were SO LOUD I'm <br/>
startled all the nice families hung around... we tramped off into the woods <br/>
to look for big piles of leaves, vines and branches.  We were also really <br/>
worried about this one because of the construction on the lot.  There was an <br/>
awful lots of debris and logs piled up where they had cleared some of the <br/>
woods.<br/>
<br/>
Persistence paid off and we found the last scranimal!  The poems are so much <br/>
fun to read and we had a great time at the park!  Thanks!  BeMa<br/>
