Go to<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/glossary/term.php?term=postal%20letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug's site has a lot of useful info on it to bone up on<br/>
lboxing terms and such. Also, you can join the newbie talk list at<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/messages<br/>

Hope this helps,<br/>
