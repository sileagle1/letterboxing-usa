                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a type of hobby that depends on having a critical mass of <br/>
participants to make it take off.  The more letterboxers there are, <br/>
and the more boxes that are planted in an area, the more interesting <br/>
it is for new boxers that try it out.  Thus they will stay with the <br/>
hobby, plant more boxes etc.  And the process repeats itself.<br/>
<br/>
The EMS store in the Crystal Mall in Waterford got the process <br/>
started, offering a clue exchange service for their customers.  This <br/>
got many boxes planted in Connecticut and Rhode Island.  The <br/>
critical mass was reached and it has grown from there.<br/>
<br/>
Other states or areas will have to wait until a local newspaper <br/>
article or other promotion gets the process rolling in the area.  <br/>
Then it will depend if a critical mass is reached.<br/>
