There are many ways to get to this Lb. You can  start at  the Schutt road<br/>
parking area which is on the outside of the park and  hike the 2 or so<br/>
miles following the blue and red markers which lead to the LB. <br/>
or<br/>
The Scenic way is to walk through the park to the Catskill Mountain House<br/>
Site and hike up from this side of South Mountain  to the LB.  Views all<br/>
over the place from this approach.<br/>
<br/>
This picture and this clue should make it easy to find this LB.<br/>
<br/>
"On the top where no body should go is 1912 etched in stone,<br/>
 If you push the LB too much it will fall and be out of touch,<br/>
 So follow the channel in the shadow  and you will gain<br/>
Another map showing an "x" where there is a downed plane"<br/>
<br/>
P.S.<br/>
When we took the Winter Picture , Bud stayed warm at home and besides we<br/>
had x county skis.<br/>

Signed on to the new wesgarrison site without a hitch -  but need more<br/>
time to find out how it  works.  Guess I'll have to read  the directions<br/>
an follow the  faqs!<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, Thanks WebMasters for your greatly appreciated help. May<br/>
the Sun follow your ways.<br/>
