Salmon Trail<br/>
Kennedy Creek<br/>
1/2 way between Shelton &amp; Olympia<br/>
Mason County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From Highway 101 in south Mason County, approximately <br/>
halfway between Olympia &amp; Shelton, turn West at milepost 356 onto <br/>
Old Olympic Highway.  Go 3/4 mile to the turn-off to a gravel road <br/>
signed "Kennedy Creek."  Go 1/2 mile on the gravel road to the <br/>
Salmon Trail parking area. Remain vigilant as lumber trucks use this <br/>
road quite frequently.  Start at the trail that heads North from the <br/>
parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  From the metal salmon, head West through the teepee.  From <br/>
the Western edge of the teepee, take 35 steps.  Head South for 10 <br/>
steps.  Scout is hiding out in a cubby hole, behind and within a <br/>
moss covered tree on the left.<br/>
