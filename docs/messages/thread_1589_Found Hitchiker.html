letterbox today. We were pleasantly surprised by the find and happy <br/>
to see all the places it had been. We currently have it in our <br/>
possesion only to give it a new container. It seems as though the <br/>
present one is a bit damaged. We plan on "returning" it to the <br/>
location that we found it only because it just seems right that <br/>
someone else should find it other than ourselves. If the person who <br/>
last hid this box reads this, I think you may know what we mean. We <br/>
are still looking for our "first" hitchiker letterbox while "in the <br/>
hunt". Until then, thanks. <br/>

letterbox. We noticed that it was damaged too. That's why we tried to tape<br/>
it back together. I guess it didn't work very well. good luck on finding<br/>
other hitchhiker letterboxes.<br/>
