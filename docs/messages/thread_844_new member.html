There are some letterboxes in DC. Go to the main map at <br/>
letterboxing.org and click on Maryland to find them. Or, we could <br/>
email the clues to you direct. Right now one ("Cherry Blossoms") is <br/>
out of commission, but the others are waiting for your squirrely <br/>

As a new member welcome to Letterboxing!!!  I'm so glad there is a new<br/>
letterboxer in the Pacific NW.  There are a few of us down here in Portland,<br/>
Oregon trying to get this hobby heating up.  The East Coast's reaaly got it<br/>
going on compared to us.  Those diehards in New England have a big gathering<br/>
happening SuperBowl Sunday to go rooting around in the snow.  THAT IS SO<br/>
COOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...I spotted a British Columbia letterbox in the September archives<br/>
I've had my eye on for my next trip up your way.  Just to give you something<br/>
to whet your appetite I'm posting it for you so you have something to look<br/>
for in your neck of the woods.  BC does need to be blue on the website on<br/>
the Canadian map, if this letterbox is, in fact, hidden up there.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

==================================================================<br/>
Here is the posting from Lisa Manne in September:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Letterboxers,<br/>
<br/>
I have put a letterbox out in British Columbia (yesterday), in Pacific <br/>
Spirit Regional Park (also known as the Endowment Lands, part of the <br/>
University of British Columbia, Vancouver).<br/>
<br/>
In Pacific Spirit Regional Park, start at the south end of the Sword Fern <br/>
trail.  The trail head is west of the SW Marine Drive and 41st Ave. <br/>
intersection, on Marine Drive.  You can park at a historical marker on the <br/>
south side of Marine Drive.  Right across Marine Drive from the marker is <br/>
the trail head.  [On the south end of the trail, there is an Ecological <br/>
Reserve immediately east of the trail.  Please don't enter it.]  Proceed <br/>
north until you pass over the Council trail.  At this point, there are <br/>
short (~6 or 7 feet tall) trees &amp; bushes close by on both sides of the <br/>
trail.  The trail will open up (this is still soon after crossing over <br/>
Council) and you'll immediately see a 6 foot tall stump off the eastern <br/>
side of the trail.  Beyond the stump is a large, long, downed tree, whose <br/>
diameter looks to be 4.5 or 5 feet (perhaps it used to be connected to the <br/>
stump :).  Walk around to the other side of the downed tree, and look for a <br/>
"cave" formed by the roots of another (upright) tree growing against the <br/>
downed tree.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Lisa<br/>

Welcome to the group.  I hope you find this interesting.  I have <br/>
always liked hiking and puzzles.  Many people have discovered us by <br/>
stumbling on a box.  Don't worry about the controversy.  I think I <br/>
am starting wintertime withdrawal symptoms, and it may show.  I'm <br/>
from Connecticut, and we already have had more snow than in all of <br/>
last winter.<br/>
<br/>
I first got interested in letterboxing because I also do <br/>
orienteering.  L'boxing is a lot like it, but the hidden treasures <br/>
are out all the time, not just at meet events.<br/>

Very possibly you may have already read the information at these <br/>
sites, but it case you haven't then have fun going through all of the <br/>
stuff. Since you mentioned that you are using an "old hand carved" <br/>
