<br/>
I head to my local "Micahel's Art Supply" or "A.C. Moore" and grab a sheet<br/>
of carving material.  It is basically the same stuff as in the speed ball<br/>
kits.  It comes in large sheets about 8.5" x 11" x 1/2" thick.  then I cut<br/>
a square out of this material.  They have a pink and White varient.<br/>
Either one should suffice.<br/>
<br/>
I did start out with erasers, although you need to be careful as some of<br/>
them end up becoming quite hard after a year or so.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
I use just about anything I can get my hands on, basically.  A good Mars<br/>
carving block or Magic Rub eraser is a good starting point.  They aren't<br/>
too spendy and it you make mistakes it doesn't set you back much.<br/>
<br/>
Two other common types of rubber to carve with are Nasco Saf T Kut<br/>
block, which is a firm white product that can be purchased in blocks<br/>
inexpensively at Art Media.  It tends to be a crumbly medium so some<br/>
people aren't wild about it.  Once you get used to it, though, it's<br/>
pretty workable.  <br/>
<br/>
Probably the best stuff I've used is Speedball Speedy Stamp, which comes<br/>
in bubble gum pink.  It cuts beautifully.  The only drawback I find with<br/>
it is that it's a wobbly medium that might be more suited to mounting.<br/>
That can be found at Michael's craft stores.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.  See you in carving class in a couple weeks!<br/>

I must say that Bill made some gorgeous stamps from the staedtler <br/>
small vinyl erasers (Dash Point Park in Federal Way, WA) They look <br/>
very professional!<br/>

Mars block is what to use! It is properly called<br/>
Staedtler Mars Artists carving medium. It comes in<br/>
various sizes, as well as thickness. I prefer to use<br/>
the 4"x4"x 1/2" piece I can get up to four stamps out<br/>
of this block. It costs me 3.35 U.S.. I get it from<br/>
Rubber Stamp Mania in Essex CT. I don't have her<br/>
number but she is a member of this list... she can<br/>
give you more details. <br/>
<br/>
this stuff is niether crumbly or overly wobbly, it<br/>
holds up to the elements very well!<br/>
<br/>
I reccomend it!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just couldnt wait to get my page up with the hints<br/>
and stuff. But when I do you will find a link to<br/>

<br/>
I'm not Bill, but I'll give a whack at an answer.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I've tried a couple of things.  Rubber cement I didn't like much.  <br/>
The stamp would fall off the wood block too easily.  The regular <br/>
white glue found in classrooms and such I didn't like much either <br/>
because when they got wet....  *shaking head*<br/>
<br/>
However, then I tried some outdoor wood glue, and that stuff worked <br/>
GREAT!  Solid as a brick.<br/>
<br/>
However, I got sick of cutting out wooden blocks (I was using a <br/>
hacksaw--not recommended), so I wisened up and realised if I just <br/>
made my stamps smaller, a mount wasn't really all that necessary.  <br/>
=)  Not only that, but the pink pudge I use to make stamps lasts a <br/>
LOT longer with the smaller stamps, which means I don't have to buy <br/>
tham as often.  Not that I think they're particularly expensive, but <br/>
it's a nice bonus.  *shrug*<br/>
<br/>
Ho hum, ho hum, it's off to home I go....<br/>

order some backer sheets as fun foam requires permanent mounting.  BTW,<br/>
a good "glue" for using fun foam on most things is Golden acrylic gel<br/>
medium (heavy)  it takes a while to set up but works really well as is<br/>
compatible with anything I've tried.  You must usually go to an artists<br/>
supply usually but I do recall seeing some in a Michaels store.<br/>

&gt; Bill, what specifically do you use to mount the stamp to the wood <br/>
block?<br/>

&gt; &gt;Staedtler also makes small vinyl erasers that are 7/8 in. by 1.1/8 <br/>
in.<br/>
&gt; &gt;They carve nicely and come in a package of 4 for $1.50 to $2.00 <br/>
depending <br/>
&gt; &gt;on where you purchase.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I like the size, and back them with 1/8 inch plywood cut to size <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt;stamped with the carved stamp image, then coat the wood with a non-<br/>
