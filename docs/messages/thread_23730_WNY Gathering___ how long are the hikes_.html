                    <div class="plaintext-content">Does anyone have any idea on how long it will take to do these hikes <br/>
for the WNY Gathering boxes?  We only have just over one day to cover <br/>
about 50-75 miles of roads (not including the hiking), and we would <br/>
like to plan our weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I had NO idea the boxes would be so spread out, or I would have <br/>
planned accordingly and gotten the information earlier (or just <br/>
decided not to come... my poor car might not handle the 750 miles <br/>
round trip AND the 200 miles of driving we'll do during the weekend).<br/>
<br/>
If you could get back to be at mindizney@cox.net by 9:00 a.m. <br/>
tomorrow, that would be great!<br/>
