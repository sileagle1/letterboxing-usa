August on our journey back from Mount Washington. Both boxes have<br/>
incredible hand carved stamps. As out of staters, tired at best, we<br/>
found the clues at Shieling challenging, but with persistance we scored<br/>
the stamp!  Same with Noone Falls, of course my hiking buddy knew from<br/>
the start were to head, but I disagreed and she was right, as usual :)<br/>
There are a must do if you're in the area, and a few minutes at dusk at<br/>
Noone Falls is all you need :) Happy Boxing, from where the warm weather<br/>
go Connecticut? Annie<br/>
