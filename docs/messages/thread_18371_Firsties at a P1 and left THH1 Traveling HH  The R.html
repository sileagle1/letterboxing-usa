<br/>
We got firsties from a new letterboxer, their P1, in Portland, OR and <br/>
left our 1st Traveling HH there.  The Ribs King will attempt a <br/>
journey with a goal to make it to the Montgomery Inn Restaurant in <br/>
Montgomery, OH, where he could be adopted locally and placed nearby <br/>
or within the restaurant.  He hopes to see a bit of the country, have <br/>
some fun along the way.  If you see him, please help him reach his <br/>
destination and let us know of his whereabouts.  He was left <br/>
yesterday at the Lion's Paw Lair.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the fun and more to come!<br/>
