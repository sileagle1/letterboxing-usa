                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of course, this doesn't take into account density.  California has 155973 sq. mi. of land. So that is one box for every 458 sq. miles.<br/>
<br/>
Ohio has 40953 sq. mi. of land or one box every 111 sq. miles.<br/>
<br/>
Connecticut, the 48th smallest state, has only 4845 sq. mi. but has a density of one box for every 3 sq. miles!  Yikes!  You guys out there must be practically tripping over boxes!!!<br/>
<br/>
In order for California to achieve that kind of density, we would need to have 51991 boxes.  Looks like we Californians have our work cut our for us! Gotta go and carve some stamps now.  Only 51651 to go...<br/>

Pretty much!! It always pays to check out suspicious looking rocks. We've<br/>
found at least six boxes that way (always cause for a happy dance!).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When looking at these tally's, keep in mind that this is a minimum <br/>
number. I've recently noticed several "series" within CT that we've <br/>
already found that have a box quantity of "1" on this new <br/>
website..and really have 4 or 5 boxes in the series.  This also does <br/>
not take into account certain mysteries that may have 1 box <br/>
listed..and (?) several actual boxes once you find the one....and <br/>
then next.. and you get the point.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess that brings up a good point that those folks who have <br/>
planted boxes should double check the LBNA website to make sure the <br/>
number of "published" boxes in the clues is accurately reflected in <br/>
the box count.  <br/>
<br/>
If you have unpublished bonus boxes, obviously don't count them, but <br/>
it would be nice to have a more accurate # to go by. <br/>
