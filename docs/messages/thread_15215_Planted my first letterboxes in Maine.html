                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just thought I would let you all know that I planted my first three <br/>
letterboxes in southern Maine. "Two-Faced Fox" is very simple to find, <br/>
the other is a mystery box which contains a clue to another nearby box <br/>
"The Green Fox". Both locations have annoyingly bad attempts at <br/>
rhyming for clues. However, it will definitely be worthwhile for the <br/>
person who finds these boxes first (i.e. you may find a few somethings <br/>
just passing through). Let me know if you have any trouble with the <br/>
clues. <br/>
I also know that two more letterboxes have been placed at the Wells <br/>
National Estuarine Research Reserve in Wells, Maine by Phyto but the <br/>
clues are not posted in the database yet because she is having trouble <br/>
with her e-mail. If anyone is taking a trip to the area anytime soon, <br/>
please get in touch with me and I would be happy to e-mail you the <br/>
clues (or perhaps Culex and I could even meet up with you to hit a few <br/>
of Phyto and Isocele's southern Maine clues we haven't gotten to yet <br/>
since we just started)<br/>
