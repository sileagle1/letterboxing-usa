Sam-I-am has done an event stamp and anyone else is encouraged to create <br/>

Is there a dance, or anything we can do to stop the rain?!  I look forward <br/>
to seeing everyone there -- I just hope it is sunny and in the low 80's.  <br/>
O.K.  we'd settle for clear and above 60 degrees at this point!  I guess we <br/>
won't have to worry about the hot weather turning the mayonnaise in the <br/>
macaroni salad after all...  BeMa<br/>
