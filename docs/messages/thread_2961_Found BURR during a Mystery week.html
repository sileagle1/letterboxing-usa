Wanda has return from a hiking trip to Maine, and we spent the last few days searching for some mystery letterboxes that we had been working on during the last couple of months.  Our efforts were rewarded!<br/>
<br/>
We located Merlin's Pre-Columbian Mystery.  We weren't the first to find it, but it is a lonely box with no other visitors for over two years!  The box was in excellent condition at a wonderful location.<br/>
<br/>
At one of the other mysteries we located, the Burr Hitchhiker stuck itself to us.  Carolyn (Leader of the Pack):  we will try to bring Burr around to your CT Workshop / Event at Mansfield Hollow picnic area on Tuesday night for a "family reunion".<br/>
