degrees here in southern Ohio so CardinalMom, the kids, and I <br/>
journeyed down to Clermont county and found 10 of franzsolo's <br/>
wonderful stamps.  We found Owl's Nest, Footprints, Stumped Parrot, <br/>
Up A Tree, Oh300io, In Flight, ZooBox, Raccoon Ridge, Happy 2003, and <br/>
Wild Things.  In addition, we were blessed with a hitchhiker <br/>
(Witchcraft) and planted 2 new boxes while we were there.  Some of <br/>
the boxes were a little soggy but the stamps were all in great <br/>
shape.  It's worth the effort to find great stamps like these!  Hope <br/>
you all had similar success.<br/>
