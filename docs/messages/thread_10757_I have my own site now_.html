<br/>
I checked out your home page and realized, when I saw the picture of you and Coyote, that I'd met you at Dog Scout Camp the past two summers. Your article in the Dog Scout newsletter and your replies to me when I started trying to place boxes as well as the activities with my own D.S. Troop 108 certainly have been a help to me.<br/>
<br/>
I really like your stamps -- and hope that I can develop my own skills so as to make some that are comparable.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I'll see you at Scout camp in June.<br/>
