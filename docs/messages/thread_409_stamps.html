&gt;  I've been wondering if there is something like an electronic<br/>
&gt;  bulletin board that you could use to say, create a rubber<br/>
&gt;  stamp template.  Several companies will give you an outlandishly<br/>
&gt;  low price if you order (red rubber) stamps on a big sheet like<br/>
&gt;  10 X 10".  I don't think it costs very much at all to order<br/>
&gt; 'em that way, then cut 'em out and mount 'em yourself.  I'd be<br/>
&gt;  willing to give this a try if others are interested in it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   This is interesting..<br/>
&gt;   I remember, bak a few months ago, someone has a source of a very<br/>
&gt;   inexpensive "postmark" style stamp, i.e., text around a circle,<br/>
&gt;   but no "image" as part of it. I think the style of stamps with<br/>
&gt;   the circle of text and a graphic inside are really nice as a<br/>
&gt;   format.<br/>
<br/>
Erik, I think what you're talking about was something Adrian had<br/>
talked about.  In fact he'd showed a sample of one our stamps done<br/>
that way.  But I think it would be cost prohibitive to use a British<br/>
supplier (because of postage).  I know of a couple of domestic<br/>
suppliers.  See<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/stamps.htm<br/>
and look at the the three suppliers near the bottom of the page.<br/>
But there was another domestic supplier somebody had talked about<br/>
one time where you could get a large sheet done for a reasonable<br/>
price.  The idea was to put as many images on the sheet as you<br/>
could fit.  If you lay them out right you can fit a lot more<br/>
on the sheet.  Then you cut them out and mount them yourself.<br/>
I thought this might work nice for us if we had like a <br/>
"community" clipboard area that we could paste images to and<br/>
when we get the sheet filled up I could submit it to a supplier.<br/>
Some suppliers work with GIF files.  So you'd just contact the<br/>
supplier and you would say, "I need a red rubber sheet made from<br/>
the image at http://www.pclink.com/elf/rubber.htm"<br/>
(this is not a real link so don't click on it)<br/>
Then when it comes in you cut out the stamps, mount 'em up and<br/>
mail 'em out to people.  Pretty cost effective I think.  I'd<br/>
be willing to do the mounting and mailing (as time permits).<br/>
I think when you post an image this way you'd also need to<br/>
number it or ID it somehow so I'd know who to mail it to.<br/>
The other option is just to mail me the image on paper.  I can<br/>
work with that just as easily.<br/>
<br/>
What does anyone think about this?<br/>

I think the savings is significant if I remember it correctly.  I just<br/>
don't remember who does this.  Does anyone know who makes sheets like<br/>
10 X 10" or 12 X 12" in red rubber?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I'll dig thru my letter archives to find the other "postmark" source,<br/>
&gt;  however, it sounds iffy to carve red rubber.....<br/>
<br/>
That's true, at least that's what I hear.  But the thing about having a<br/>
circle part or component in which you could place another image perhaps<br/>
in a different color (you talk about this below)... well, that may be<br/>
one<br/>
way to use the sheet, to set up some images that could be reused as<br/>
parts<br/>
to other images.  In other words, you could compose your image from<br/>
various<br/>
sizes of circles, boxes or whatnot (with text inside of them or not).<br/>
See attach. for a (bad) example.<br/>
<br/>
I know that reordering an image that has already been cast is very<br/>
inexpensive.  This way you could combine hand-carved, store bought,<br/>
or other types of stamps and be creative with them.  People may want <br/>
to do this with the stamp imprint they leave behind.  Well, I guess<br/>
you could put a composite set of stamps in the box too -- that would<br/>
mean we'd want to carry to stamp pads perhaps if we want to get the<br/>
two color effect.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;          Who says a letterbox "image" has to be made from only one stamp.<br/>
&gt;  If the "postmark" circle is cheap enough (I seem to remember $3 or $4),<br/>
&gt;  the "image" could be another, carved stamp. Stamp the text circle, stamp<br/>
&gt;  the image in the circle. Use two colors even! ....<br/>
<br/>
I think doing it like I described would bring the price down quite a bit<br/>
from $3.00 to perhaps $1.00 or less.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Dan'l, I realize we are going in two directions here - it'd come<br/>
&gt;  together eventually<br/>
<br/>
Seems together already...<br/>

<br/>
This is a cool idea, but I wonder if it might not negate the notion<br/>

Maybe I am misunderstanding what you are proposing here, but<br/>
perhaps it would work better to have individuals design their own<br/>
circle or other shape stamps, to go with certain sets or themes.<br/>
Wouldn't save as much money, but then it wouldn't be so generic.<br/>
For example, the theme I was working on the other day (and gave<br/>
up on the text) was for Wis. wildflowers.<br/>
So I might have made into rubber four circles with the text:<br/>
"Elvehjem Woods * Wildflowers * 1999 *".<br/>
Then I could carve the flower rounds to stamp inside the circles<br/>
from carving material. The box would carry the two stamps.<br/>
This would be an option for handcarving aficionados and perfect<br/>
if you could get a big discount for text only stamps. (Only <br/>
difficulty is getting good registration if you happen to mount<br/>
your carving on wood, or don't cut the material itself into a <br/>
circle shape.)<br/>
The problem with ordering a sheet of rubber with text only inside<br/>
shapes would be that you'd be wasting the rubber space inside <br/>
the commercial stamp. If it didn't bother you to have a commercial<br/>
stamp made of your carving, you could just have the stamp made<br/>
with the carving image in place. This would crimp unique placement,<br/>
but two or more colors could still be stamped if one carries markers<br/>
in addition to stamp pads. Or maybe you could do two or more<br/>
shapes: one large square, a smaller circle that would fit inside it, <br/>
and then one with just text or image in the middle for another stamp, <br/>
for example, then most of the rubber inside wouldn't be wasted, and<br/>
you'd have three stamps for the price of one!<br/>
Just thinking out loud....<br/>

Well, it would not suit every purpose, that's for sure.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think the savings comes two ways.  One way is to order a sheet<br/>
in which you have preaaranged the images in an economic fashion.<br/>
You can do this with original images.  The other way is to reorder.<br/>
The price seems to drop dramatically when you reorder because the<br/>
main cost is in the original engraving.  Even still, you can <br/>
arrange images on a sheet even for a one time order and save <br/>
money.  You'll get more stamps per square that way than you would<br/>
otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Having standard images though, that could be "composed" on the<br/>
fly is still sort of intriguing I think, esp. for the artists.<br/>
Mixing and matching hand-carved and manufactured stamps might<br/>
be fun too, using different colors, etc...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Are people are recording # of letterboxes found or<br/>
&gt; #<br/>
&gt; &gt; of different stamp imprints found, if they are<br/>
&gt; trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to earn a badge, for example...(like a badge for<br/>
&gt; every<br/>
&gt; &gt; 100..).  Can you help me with that concern before<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; carve any more?  Thanks, Linda of PetLinK<br/>

I think you have it. Think of it in this light: Just<br/>
as you have your very own personality and your<br/>
personal stamp should show that in some way to some<br/>
degree, so does each individual site have it's own<br/>
degree. As for a park with a specific logo where you<br/>
want to plant more than one , you could carve that<br/>
logo with numbers on it to delineate a different find<br/>
"wackyworld park 1, wacky world park 2...) <br/>
Just what I do....<br/>

I certainly understand where you're coming from.  I had my husband <br/>
do the Home Depot/Lowe's thing, too.  He avoided the plumbing <br/>
question but managed to learn that these stores in our area no <br/>
longer carry the plumber's gaskets.<br/>
<br/>
My mother, on the other hand, was more successful at Michael's (the <br/>
craft suppy store).  She found something in the rubber stamping <br/>
section (go figure) that seemed like similar stuff for 99 cents a <br/>
sheet and it comes in multiple colors.  I wasn't with her so I can't <br/>
verify if it will work very well for stamping but it's worth a <br/>
shot...  There are other stores that might carry the stuff, too--<br/>
like Hobby Lobby or Jo-Ann Fabrics (etc.) stores.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

Try Aubuchon Hardware.  Ask for <u>red rubber</u> plumbers gasket. 
Also, sometimes you find it in auto supply stores if they cater to antique
cars.  Don't be afraid of the burly plumber guys, they love rescuing
ladies in distress AND they might just be captivated by a boyish treasure
hunt.
</p><p>The foam found in Michaels for $0.99 is most likely "fun foam" which
can be cut with scissors or an exactos but is pretty hard to cut as it
tends to tear.  BUT, it makes fairly good squishy backing material
required for mounting red rubber face material!
</p><p>Mounting a stamp is not required for thick erasers but is necessary
for materials thinner than 3/8".  Do this:
<br/> 
</p><ul>
<li>
Carve your image.</li>
<li>
Cut a piece of fun foam slightly larger than your image.</li>
<li>
cut a piece of hard base material like plywood, small ceramic tiles, thin
planks, fancy acrylic handles, hand turned wooden lathe shapes, precut
plywood shapes found in many craft stores, or any other handle close to
the size but just a hair bigger than the stamp.</li>
<li>
Using rubber cement or Golden's acrylic gel medium (if you're not a serious
painter you'll gasp at the cost), apply a coat to the fun foam and the
previously carved image, let dry to a haze and press together on a flat
surface with hand pressure for a minute. CAREFULLY,  run  the
exacto blade around the edge of the carving just through the excess glue
and rub off the extra on the surface of the fun foam.  Then, trim
the foam so that there is no more than 1/8" around the edge of the stamp.</li>
<li>
If your stamp backer is a wooden board or plywood you can now stamp the
image onto the board before you apply the stamp to its face.  Later
you can polyurethane over the image to preserve the stamp.</li>
<li>
If you have stamped your backer: Line up the carving with the image so
it faces the same direction.</li>
<li>
Repeat the glue process to apply the image and squishy backing to the hard
stamp backing.</li>
<li>
Make sure to stamp your own book before casting your work to the winds!!!</li>
<li>
Enjoy,</li>
<li>
Susan</li>

Lowes (I have also found that the salespeople don't<br/>
always know what you're talking about, either, lol).<br/>
<br/>
I really didn't like the plumber's gasket.  I had a<br/>
hard time carving it (with the speedball cutters) and<br/>
it didn't take the ink as well as other mediums.  On<br/>
the other hand, my friend got a beautiful stamp out of<br/>
her effort and seemed to like it pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Keep an eye out at Micheals.  We got large pieces of<br/>
Speedy Cut (I think they were about 12"x12") on sale<br/>
for $2.  Could have been a closeout, I don't know.  We<br/>
bought all we could in the Va.Bch area but I don't<br/>
have a Michaels here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enasco has the Safety cut fairly cheap (thanks to<br/>
whomever suggested them).  You can get 25 lbs of it<br/>
for about $25. This stuff carves like butter but can<br/>
be crumbly for some.  You'll find it under arts and<br/>
crafts, printmaking materials.<br/>
http://www.enasco.com<br/>
<br/>
Trish also suggested Dick Blick for the larger<br/>
erasers.  They have stores about the country as well<br/>
as the website. <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<br/>
Actually, I don't like the Dick Blick carving material that much.  My <br/>
all time preference is for the Staedtler MarsCarve.  I have had good <br/>
luck ordering it or the erasers from Duall in MI.  Plus their <br/>
shipping charges are reasonable.  Many stamp stores also carry it <br/>
(Stampeaz, etc).  It is EXPENSIVE but Staedtler does make one size <br/>
that is affordable .5x4x4 for $2.60.  It carves wonderfully, takes an <br/>
edge without crumbling and is thick enough that it doesn't need to be <br/>
mounted.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
BTW, I solved the transfer problem for inkjet images - buy cheap <br/>
replacement cartridges that don't use waterproof ink :-( .  Nothing <br/>
worse than leaving clues next to your waterbottle and finding them <br/>
totally illegible. On the bright side I don't have to worry about <br/>
solvents or access to a laser printer...<br/>

I'm sure you'll get a bunch of replies, but here's mine (and I do <br/>
love to hang out at our local Home Depot plumbing department, where <br/>
the most knowlegeable "Homer" is a petite woman, so EVERY question <br/>
feels like a dumb one...)<br/>
<br/>
I thought the plumber's gasket stunk. I mean, not aromatically, but <br/>
as carving material. It more ripped than carved...it might be better <br/>
for etching, and that could open a whole new artistic world with <br/>
brayers and special inks and hand made papers...<br/>
<br/>
Ever since TrishK turned me on to it, I've been addicted <br/>
to "Staedtler Mastercarve Artist Carving Block." It's cheaper than <br/>

I have to admit that I had never noticed that DB carries the <br/>
Staedtler and at better prices!  I liked the package of 27 small <br/>
stamps.  Hmmm...  I have ordered the EZ cut there but don't like the <br/>
way that it carves and didn't realize they carried anything else.<br/>

&gt; Ever since TrishK turned me on to it, I've been addicted<br/>
&gt; to "Staedtler Mastercarve Artist Carving Block." It's cheaper than<br/>
&gt; the speedball and indeed "cuts like butter." Not to promote one<br/>
&gt; source over another, but it's easy to get at dick blick.<br/>
...snip<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info, Jay.<br/>
<br/>
I checked out dick blick (what a name!) online, and they're asking $22.99<br/>
plus shipping for a 9 x 12 x 3/4 sheet of Staedtler Mastercarve.  My cousin<br/>
found 6 1/2 x 11 x 1/3 Speedy-cut in Providence (RI) for $8.95.  I wasn't<br/>
thrilled with the crumbly nature of speedy-cut, but the only other material<br/>
I could find was 3/4 x 2 1/4 vinyl erasers...the Michaels in Warwick carries<br/>
no carving supplies at all, and the other big craft store (I can't remember<br/>
the name to save my life...) was phasing out carving supplies, but dug up<br/>
some linoleum tools from the back room for me.  Is the Staedtler worth the<br/>
extra money?  Does it carve more like the vinyl (which I found much easier)?<br/>
Should I start planning a letterboxing/supply run out to the wild, wild west<br/>
(CT)?<br/>
<br/>
I also have a general opinion question...  I spend many, many hours carving<br/>
a celtic design stamp with the idea of using it as a box stamp some day.  I<br/>
liked it enough that I want to use it as my personal stamp; however, it's<br/>
quite big... it's a circle measuring 2 3/4" across.  I used it in the ASA<br/>
pond letterbox in Peacedale (RI), and it and my dog's stamp pretty much<br/>
filled the log's page (3x5 index card) with just enough room left for our<br/>
names and date.  I noticed that just about everyone else had either a small<br/>
commercial stamp or an eraser sized carved stamp.  Since any other people I<br/>
may go boxing with will spill onto a second page of the log, will I be<br/>
considered a space-hog if I continue using this stamp?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any feedback.<br/>

 You should go ahead and do what ever works best for you. Lots of <br/>
people start out with a store bought stamp and then decide to change <br/>
over to a hand carved one at a point in time when they feel they have <br/>
learned enough about the process to do so. There really is no right or <br/>
wrong.<br/>

of what people like about letterboxing is collecting hand carved and<br/>
designed images.<br/>
<br/>
I would say try and find several boxes -- I found 18 before I planted<br/>
one. See what they have. Then think about planting. If you are just<br/>
getting started don't plant just yet.<br/>
<br/>
Every letterboxer I have asked has all said they would rather have the<br/>
most crudely carved handmade stamp over the most beautiful and<br/>
intricate store bought stamp, and that every hand carved image is a<br/>
work of art bc someone actually made it. My first planted box<br/>
contained a stamp I thought was horrible. Yet everyone has appreciated<br/>
the effort and collecting my image.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome and hope you enjoy the hobby.<br/>

  Welcome to the hobby! As a new boxer you have lot's of questions, I know I did. Most of your questions can be answered on letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com in their getting started sections. Lot's of reading and research but it's time well spent if you plan to pursue this hobby. Also, there is a talk list specifically for new boxers that you might want to check out at:<br/>
<br/>
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
  But I recommmend reading up as much as you can about how to get started and the history of this wonderful hobby. <br/>

seek some boxes before planting, I think getting a store bought stamp <br/>
to start out with is just fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Once you've found some boxes and start to see what these hand carved <br/>
stamps look like, what they are made of and some of the different <br/>
techniques used in carving, you'll more than likely be inspired to <br/>
try your hand at carving your signature stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
But for now, read up about 'boxing on the many sites available and <br/>
then get out there and explore some boxes--see how they are put <br/>
together, how the clues are written and enjoy their creativity.  This <br/>
will help you develop your own sense of style.<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing! You definitely do NOT have to carve your own<br/>
stamps, some boxers never do &amp; that's perfectly ok. As alwayschaos pointed<br/>
out, you may find that after you start seeing some of the hand-carved<br/>
stamps, that you'll want to try it. And, I'll add that you do not need to be<br/>
an "artist" to make some wonderful stamps.<br/>
<br/>
You may want to join the Newboxers yahoo group, b/c you'll find answers to<br/>
lots of questions that you may not think to ask, as well as those you do<br/>
think to ask. The group was formed for people new to boxing, but lots of<br/>
"oldtimers" are active in the group, offering a variety of perspectives on<br/>
letterboxing topics. I believe you can reach the website for the group here:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, and happy boxing!!<br/>

&gt; Hi Eileen,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Welcome to letterboxing! You definitely do NOT have to carve your <br/>
own<br/>
&gt; stamps, some boxers never do &amp; that's perfectly ok. As alwayschaos <br/>
pointed<br/>
&gt; out, you may find that after you start seeing some of the hand-<br/>
carved<br/>
&gt; stamps, that you'll want to try it. And, I'll add that you do not <br/>
need to be<br/>
&gt; an "artist" to make some wonderful stamps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may want to join the Newboxers yahoo group, b/c you'll find <br/>
answers to<br/>
&gt; lots of questions that you may not think to ask, as well as those <br/>
you do<br/>
&gt; think to ask. The group was formed for people new to boxing, but <br/>
lots of<br/>
&gt; "oldtimers" are active in the group, offering a variety of <br/>
perspectives on<br/>
&gt; letterboxing topics. I believe you can reach the website for the <br/>
group here:<br/>
&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have fun, and happy boxing!!<br/>
