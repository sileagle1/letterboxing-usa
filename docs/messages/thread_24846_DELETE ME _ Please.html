Hey SpringChick,<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where you are relative to Holland, but I have to share a funny<br/>
story with you about when this southern girl visited Michigan for the first<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I was selected several years ago to work on a task force for my parent<br/>
company's nationwide computer system changeover, which meant I had to travel<br/>
to Holland, MI, several times for meetings. On my first trip, I was<br/>
learning about the system set up for my own subsidiary company so I was<br/>
pretty much visiting by myself. While there, I met quite a few locals at<br/>
the company. One of the things they ALL told me was "Go out to the lake -<br/>
you gotta see the lake." I kept thinking to myself - "I've seen lakes, lots<br/>
of lakes, I go to the lake in my own hometown." Further, I have been to<br/>
Florida and spent time on their beaches, been to Galveston and Padre Island,<br/>
and lived in Southern California. No stinking lake was going to impress<br/>
me! Still though, after the fourth day in Holland and all these people<br/>
saying "Have you been to the lake yet?", and having time on my hands one<br/>
evening (it must've been May), I got in my rental car and drove to the<br/>
lake. I drove into the deserted parking lot and saw one person there,<br/>
flying a couple of amazing kits, and SURF! And TIDE! I realized right away<br/>
the error of my judgment and I turned around and went to the closest store,<br/>
grabbed a six-pack of beer and some deli meat and cheese, a few crackers,<br/>
and I returned to the lake. Now excited about a nice picnic on the beach, I<br/>
stepped out of my car - and it was really, really windy! And not just<br/>
windy, but cutting COLD! I was so desperate to enjoy waves again that I got<br/>
out anyway, set my butt down on the hood of my car and picnicked the sun<br/>
down. It truly was beautiful and an experience well worth the chilly temps!<br/>
