&gt; Two Birders Letterbox<br/>
&gt; Placed September 8, 2002<br/>

&gt; Ellanor C. Lawrence Park<br/>
&gt; Near Centreville, VA<br/>
&gt; Fairfax County, VA<br/>
&gt; Difficulty: Easy walk, easy directions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Entering Ellanor C. Lawrence Park from Route 28 onto Walney Road, turn<br/>
left<br/>
&gt; into Walney Pond parking lot.  From the parking lot, follow the paved path<br/>
&gt; to the right across a zig-zag walkway over the pond.  Stay to the right on<br/>
&gt; the mulch trail and turn left into the woods.  Cross the wooden footbridge<br/>
&gt; over the stream.  At the Visitor's Center sign, take the path to the left<br/>
&gt; instead of the steps leading up the hill.  Bear left on the trail at the<br/>
&gt; intersection of the trail and the service road to cross another wooden<br/>
&gt; bridge.  Starting at the two large logs lying perpendicular to one another<br/>
&gt; at the right of the path, take another ten steps to stand by a large oak<br/>
&gt; tree on the left.  At its base, you will see some fallen limbs across a<br/>
&gt; small footpath.  Take the path about 25 yards up the hill until you reach<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; slightly level space.  You will see a large fallen tree about 10 paces<br/>
&gt; directly to your left.  The box is located in a cavity on top of the<br/>
fallen<br/>
&gt; trunk and is covered with limbs and bark.<br/>
