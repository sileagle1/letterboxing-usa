I will also plant one while I'm here.  I brought one of those little <br/>

Then, I'm sitting in my hotel room here and, I realize that I carried <br/>
that thing on thirty-two hours of flights.  Glad I didn't have to <br/>
explain it to security.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there--<br/>
<br/>
Fun trying to letterbox in Asia, eh?  To date the only stashing games <br/>
we've successfully hunted for in Asia are geocaching &amp; terracaching--<br/>
so if you've got the bug to look for stuff you might want to go that <br/>
route. We ended up planting letterboxes in the various places we <br/>
visited in Asia (Korea, China, Thailand, Cambodia) just so there'd be <br/>
some boxes there to seek out.  Unfortunately, we haven't yet visited <br/>
the Philippines.  :(  <br/>
<br/>
We also did a bunch of geocaching &amp; terracaching there just so we'd <br/>
get to explore more of those little known secret treasures scattered <br/>
about the region--that letterboxes typically lead us to. There are <br/>
probably a few geocaches scattered about the Philippines--just <br/>
knowing how more internationally popular that hobby is!<br/>
<br/>
However, when I look for 'little-known' international letterbox <br/>
clues, I usually go to this site: <br/>
<br/>
www.letterboxing-germany.de/  <br/>
<br/>
Occasionally, you'll see clues to letterboxes around Asia.  Be sure <br/>
to click on the British flag to view clues in English.  Otherwise, <br/>
hone your German skills.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there aren't any listed there for the Philippines yet--<br/>
although you could change that.  ;)  Oh, sometimes you might find a <br/>
hybrid letterbox/geocache on the geocaching site so you could look <br/>
for those, too.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
