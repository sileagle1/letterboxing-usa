  If that was aimed at me (I am assuming because you hit reply to my email and not the dozens before) I agree about keeping politics out of boxing and that was why I didn't say anything for the last 24 hours about this thread but then when people start chatting about being on the White House Lawn for a Gather and Bush cutting down trees yatta, yatta than I think I had a right to make a comment about it. Why are are all the others allowed to put images in peoples head and claim it non political but I make one anti Kerry comment and it's "No politics allowed" Interesting. <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway I agree to keep politics but those were my motives! <br/>
<br/>
  Respectfully, IT<br/>

    My son wanted me to make a letterbox based on Bush v Kerry. I told him that letterboxing was an enjoyable past time and we don't mix politics with enjoyable past times! ;)<br/>
<br/>
    I like the thread on the Kerry stuff...because I am assuming it is a letterbox in disguise. Can we please keep politics off this forum? <br/>
<br/>
    Respectfully,<br/>
    Peppermint Patti :)<br/>

      ugh! Saying that sounds as though you have already put Kerry in the White a fate I do not wish on the country. <br/>
      Please don't send 9 million emails. I'm not trying to fight. <br/>
