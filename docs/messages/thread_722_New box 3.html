<br/>
Three boxes on an out and back hike over the blue blazed Narragansett<br/>
Trail. 4 miles in a generally north-south line, about 2.5 hours.<br/>
Several other letterboxes are close by, both on the Narragansett Trail<br/>
and connected closely by the Pachaug and Tippecanset Trails.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: in North Stonington, CT, from Rte. 2 or 49, travel along<br/>
Wyassup Lake Rd to park at the state boat launch. The trail begins just<br/>
north along the road: pass through a gate and follow an old dirt road<br/>
before turning left onto singletrack with the blue blazes.<br/>
<br/>
After 0.7 miles of hiking, climb steeply and pass through a stone wall<br/>
to reach High Ledge on your right. From the main promontory, the High<br/>
Ledge Letterbox is at 350 degrees, in the western edge of a waist high<br/>
flat faced rock, just across the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing north with the Narragansset Trail, pass down the cliff line<br/>
and across a picturesque valley. Cover 0.75 miles of woods walking,<br/>
passing along a ridge with easterly views, to turn right on a woods<br/>
road. Follow this way for about 0.5 miles before turning left with the<br/>
blazes. Hike downhill through a switch back and along a short piece<br/>
before turning sharply right and scrambling up a ridge. At the top, the<br/>
trail goes left: turn right, south, to the overlook. The Bullet Ledge<br/>
Letterbox is hidden in the western face of a small hanging rock to the<br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
Returning back with the blue blazes, find the Wyassup Lake Letterbox in<br/>
the parking areas south end, behind a rock just beyond the launch area<br/>
information board.<br/>
