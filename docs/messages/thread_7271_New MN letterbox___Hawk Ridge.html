<br/>
Hawk Ridge is a scenic overlook on the shores of Lake Superior. In <br/>
the fall, raptors find their way down the North Shore to the Duluth <br/>
area to cross the lake. They need thermals to reach an altitude that <br/>
will enable them to make it across, so they come to the Duluth hills, <br/>
thermal up, and cross over. Its a fantastic site to see along with <br/>
the awesome view of Lake Superior. What a GREAT place for a letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Find your way to Hawk Ridge (city park)in Duluth, Minnesota. As you <br/>
pull into the Hawk Ridge overlook area you will be on pavement to the <br/>
first overlook area. Continue on the dirt road to the second overlook <br/>
area. There will be one obvious parking place in the middle. To the <br/>
left of the parking spot (when looking at the lake) there will be a <br/>
large rock with the word "steps" painted on it. Follow the steps down <br/>
and go forward on the path until you reach a large rock area that <br/>
overlooks the lake. There are different trails heading off from <br/>
this "plateau". Follow the blue spray paint dots on the rocks to the <br/>
right (when looking at the lake). Continue to follow the blue dots <br/>
until you reach a heavy thicket with two very large rocks on the left <br/>
of the trail. The rock in front has one of the parks blue dots on it. <br/>
The box is hidden behind the large rock under a pile of small rocks <br/>
to conceal it from view...once you find the box, you will be very <br/>
close to the bottom of another set of stairs. Follow those stairs <br/>
back up to the parking/overlook...good luck and happy hawk watching!<br/>
