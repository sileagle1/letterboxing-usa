<div>Name of Box:  Robin Hood</div>

<p align="center">Wanted</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Robin Hood</p>
<p align="center">For stealing from New Hampshires wealthy 
residents</p>
<p align="center">Often seen wearing a pointed green hat, coat 
and tights.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Robin Hood has struck again, stealing from 
the rich to give to the poor. He was last seen in the region of the worlds most 
climbed mountain.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">Beware, this man is very <i>keen</i> and 
cunning. His <i>main</i> goal is to find a quiet park with large <i>rocks</i> to 
<i>bury</i> his stash under.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">A giant portrait of this thief has been 
painted, by the wooden ship docked in the local park, to aid in his 
capture.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">He was recently spotted by the pond, darting 
past the local swimming hole and down the shore. Local law enforcement has 
searched the area and noticed pointed shoe prints by the stream, and further 
along, a red feather at the T. </p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">He is known for stashing his goods beneath 
the south side of boulders easily spotted due to the presence of trees growing 
out of them. Robin is very good at camouflaging his boxes with leaves and 
debris. </p>

Crook!</p></div></body></html>
