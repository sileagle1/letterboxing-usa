If you collect hiking staff medallions, or would like to get started with a huge collection, please read.  <br/>
<br/>
This past year I did a nation wide road trip and collected hiking staff medallions from 17 national parks.  I've since decided to sale this collection.  All 17 medallions are brand new, beautiful, and still packaged with the tacks.  Many of the packages have information about the parks.  Most are made by either Hike America of Redwood, CA or LW Bristol Classics of Bristol, TN.  All were bought at the bookstores of the national parks and are only available through these outlets.  The cost was between $3.50 and $4 each. This is a one time offer.  Email me off list if you would like to purchase the collection.  I can also send you a digital photograph of the collection.  <br/>
<br/>
The parks: Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Carlsbad Caverns, Capitol Reef, Everglades, Badlands, Devil' Tower, Grand Canyon, Joshua tree, Mesa Verde, Mount Rushmore, Saguaro, Natchez-Trace, Redwood, Yellowstone, &amp; Zion.  <br/>
