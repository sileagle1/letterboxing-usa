in the Cleveland Metroparks system. Oh no, credibility! <br/>
-as the opportunity, so the responsibility-<br/>
<br/>
2. Found "just above par", and a Dunlop in the mud. Thanks polly, very<br/>
nice stamp in the Cleveland Metropark system. This is a nice park and is<br/>
highly recommended to all, no stinging nettles that I know of.<br/>
<br/>
3. Found "Tulip Tree" @ Jabberwocky, <br/>
    time well spent, the green so green, the sky was blue, water's<br/>
cool,    the sun hot, nothing makes a boxer stop! except to find a box<br/>
well    hid. <br/>
   drat, no fox, he is too sly, he's too well hid, there's just<br/>
mosquitoes and poison ivy instead. there's lots of cans but no ham or<br/>
spam, I could not find him dear Ruthann,  but where are the stones, the<br/>
bones the ghosties?, why are there 3 lone fontains squirting? I do not<br/>
understand, well maybe sunset makes me stop and hours to go, and hours<br/>
to go, I'll try again another day, thanks anyway, oh what a day!<br/>
<br/>
3. Hidden, "Nuts" clue to follow <br/>
