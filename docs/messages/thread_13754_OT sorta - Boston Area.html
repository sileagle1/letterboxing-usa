                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All,<br/>
    I know this is technically off-topic, but since so many <br/>
letterboxers live in the New England area I thought I'd ask.<br/>
<br/>
    We are planning a trip to the Boston Area over the Fourth of <br/>
July - Woburn, MA to be exact - and will be there about two weeks.  I <br/>
would really appreciate others suggestions on what to visit - so far <br/>
the only thing we have planned definitely is the Freedom Trail in <br/>
Boston, attending the witch trials in Salem and one day for a drive <br/>
up to Maine.  I know that the Boston area is full of historical <br/>
sites, so I would like to find some of those that might not be quite <br/>
so well-known.  Also since we will be there 2 weeks I would like to <br/>
try to get to some parks and sites in nearby states - something in <br/>
the 2-3 hour drive time range from Woburn.  If anyone can help with <br/>
suggestions, please let me know!!<br/>
<br/>
I am planning on doing some letterboxing while I am there - but I <br/>
need historical sites to appease the other members of the family...<br/>
<br/>
So as not to increase traffic on the list for the others please email <br/>
me back privately.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
Bill<br/>
