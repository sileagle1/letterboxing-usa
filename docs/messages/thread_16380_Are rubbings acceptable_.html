I have an antique printers block with a design I would dearly love to <br/>
use as my signature. Printer blocks do not make good stamps, but make <br/>
excellent images when placed under a sheet of paper and then are <br/>
rubbed over with a light hand &amp; pencil/chalk. Would this be <br/>
acceptable or should i attempt to make a stamp of the image?<br/>

<br/>
My only thought, knowing next to nithing aobut printer's blocks, woudl be<br/>
size--you wnat somethign small enough to fit on a micro-box log.  I know<br/>
some people use only a portion of hteir stamp for hte microboxes. This might<br/>
be an option for you as well.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to rub into any of my logs, once I get them out there!<br/>

Dear Mizz Kitty,<br/>
<br/>
(Tips his Stetson) Ma'am, there ain't no protocols as such but I be a-<br/>
thinkin' maybe you best make a stamp of the image. Leastwise, you <br/>
would then be sure that if some danged polecat made a book outta <br/>
thick paper, you could getcher lovely image in there. Be happy to <br/>
look at an image you did from this, too, btw.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps y'all,<br/>

Let me chime in and say this is more than acceptable, it sounds like <br/>
a fantastic and unique signature to use for letterboxing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I see no problem, MizzKitty, with the use of a rubbing instead of a <br/>
stamped image to sign in at a letterbox.  It seems quite within the <br/>
spirit of the endeavour.  We'll all admit to having seen (or even <br/>
made) somewhat inadequate stamped impressions.  Might even find <br/>
acceptable preprinted images affixed to the page;  I've seen that a <br/>
couple of times.<br/>
