If the National Park Service (NPS) keeps removing boxes and has <br/>
stated that they don't want them in the National Parks System, why <br/>
are letterboxes still being placed in them?  It seems like only a <br/>
matter of time before someone gets arrested and/or fined for planting <br/>
a box in a National Park.<br/>
There's plenty of other places in the great outdoors that would be <br/>
willing to accept letterboxes if folks would approach the managers <br/>
and explain the hobby to them.<br/>
