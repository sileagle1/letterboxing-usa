                    <div class="plaintext-content">As you are all aware ... this message board generates a LOT of <br/>
email.  About once a week or so, I check the members list to see if <br/>
members are "bouncing".  I can re-set some of them, some of them are <br/>
just old/bad email addresses, and others are simply bouncing because <br/>
they are over their email quota (mailbox too full, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
A simple solution to this is to change your message delivery to <br/>
the "Daily Digest" version.  This means you'd get one or two messages <br/>
per day, with a listing of all of the emails from that day.  <br/>
<br/>
Some folks prefer the individual emails, but others would simply like <br/>
to scan through for the messages they are interested in (which is why <br/>
that two-letter state abbreviation is so appreciated!).<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to set your membership to "no mail" which still <br/>
allows you access to the messages, you just have to log onto the <br/>
message board and retrieve them individually.<br/>
<br/>
To change your message delivery mode .. just visit the message board <br/>
website at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa <br/>
and on the right hand side click "edit my membership".  If you have <br/>
trouble, you can email me, and I can change your delivery settings <br/>
for you.<br/>
<br/>
This has been a public service announcement.  <br/>
Thank you!<br/>
