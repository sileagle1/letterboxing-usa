                    <div class="plaintext-content">Over the past weekend, on April the 19th, Birder Girl and Capt Bruce planted the Javelina letterbox, the first in a series of nature letterboxes.   Clues: From Tucson, follow Route 10, East to Route 80 and turn South onto Route 80.  Looking for signs to a village whose name means "door", turn onto the road to the village.  Drive past the village and continue up into the canyon being very careful to look for Geronimo watching you from the mysterious caves in the cliffs.  Once you pass a sign that says "Stewart", go 1/2 mile to a sign that could say VIA TIN POTS but doesn't.  Park and struggle upward, 200 yards to the top.   Stop and look around you.  If your heart doesn't stop from amazement, you are in the wrong place. Once you can drag your gaze away from the views, look at the Magical Viewing Machine. Now, make sure you are alone. Set the Magical Viewer on 21 and tilt the machine all the way upward.  Isn't the sky beautiful?  Now, let your gaze drop all the way down the "trunk" of the machine and onto the "roots".   Being careful of any scary or dangerous creatures that may luck in the "roots", find the VIA TIN POTS Letterbox!!! Congratulations!  There is a surprise inside!  Please let us know if you find it.  Our email is fahy.bygate@verizon.netPlease observe all precautions, etc. <br/>
