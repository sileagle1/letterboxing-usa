                    <div class="plaintext-content">As many of you know, Ryan is currently hiking around Mount Rainier on <br/>
the Wonderland Trail for the Washington Trails Hike-a-thon. Before he <br/>
left, he had recieved an email from someone who had tried to make a <br/>
pledge, but it did not show up at Ryan's website. If any of you have <br/>
made pledges, please email Ryan directly at riskynil@pocketmail.com <br/>
to let him know!<br/>
This is so he can double check that all pledges are recorded.<br/>
<br/>
As an added incentive, we have a PRIZE for the person making the <br/>
largest Pledge! Either thru the flat dollar amount or the per mile <br/>
catagory. The person who ends up donating the largest dollar amount <br/>
to WTA will recieve a Mt. Rainier "Bandanamap". This is a lovely 100% <br/>
cotton bandana with an exact full color reproduction of the Mount <br/>
Rainier topo map screen printed onto it. In the event that we have a <br/>
tie, we will draw names for the bandana.<br/>
Also Two Lucky Runners Up will recieve a Mount Rainier Patch. The <br/>
Patch is suitable for sewing onto your letterboxing backpack and <br/>
shows Mt. Rainier in all it's glory! (again, in the event of a tie, <br/>
names will be drawn from the top pledgers)<br/>
<br/>
So Please keep those pledges coming and be sure to email Ryan <br/>
directly when you make a pledge. He will be checking his email on <br/>
8/20 when he passes by a Ranger Station. For those folks worried that <br/>
he might hike more than 150 miles. It is highly unlikely! He did not <br/>
get a start until the month was half over!  Remember you can make a <br/>
pledge until the end of August.<br/>
