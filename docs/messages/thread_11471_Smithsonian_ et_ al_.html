waiting... and this!  Thank you, Randy, for making some sense out of it.  I <br/>
think that it's a good way to resolve it.  Let's use the same method for <br/>
selecting the new Smithsonian stamp.  Anyone interested can make a stamp and <br/>
post the scan of it to another file I've set up in the same section <br/>
(Smithsonian Design Contest).  Since you can't rush art, let's put a May 1st <br/>
deadline on entries.  After that, I think we can use the poll feature to <br/>
determine which box should be sent as the "official".  I won't be submitting <br/>
a design.  There are a lot of other good cavers out there, and it's someone <br/>
else's turn.  Besides, they've already asked me for Flutterby and Kmartha, <br/>
and  I'll be trying to get one more of mine in the collection, too.  The <br/>
nice thing about it, for everyone, is that all those who got the original <br/>
box will now have a chance to go back.  Those of you (about 50, near as I <br/>
can tell) who got the original have a collector's item.  The good news is <br/>
that I have the first scroll log, and I'll send that along with my other <br/>
donations.<br/>
<br/>
     This is really exciting!  I'd like to encourage everyone who carves to <br/>
post up their best efforts (unless you just can't part with them... but if <br/>
you can't, I suppose that you shouldn't be leavin'em unattended, anyway).<br/>
