Near: Ocho Rios, Jamaica<br/>
Placed 18 December 2001 by<br/>

This is a microletterbox with stamp and log in a waterproof 35mm film <br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
There are several fees applicable for this letterbox.  (All fees <br/>
below are in US dollars in winter 2001) The principle fee is <br/>
transportation to Ocho Rios, on the north coast of Jamaica, south of <br/>
Cuba in the Caribbean.<br/>
<br/>
If you find yourself at the Ocho Rios dock, a taxi can easily be <br/>
arranged ($22 round trip for 1-4 people) to the park at Dunns River <br/>
Falls.  Walking is about 3-4 miles and not recommended.  Admission to <br/>
the park will be $6 per person, and a more worthwhile use of travel <br/>
money I have never found. <br/>
<br/>
Here, you climb a series of waterfalls and riffles from a small <br/>
beach.  The river ascends a hundred feet or more over the half mile <br/>
or so of climbing.  There were hundreds of people  local and <br/>
tourist  doing this on the day I was there.  It is a real gas, and <br/>
laying down in the the water was deliciously cool when I began to get <br/>
warm from the climb. <br/>
<br/>
Water shoes are not required, but recommended to reduce the chance of <br/>
a slip and fall.  They can be rented at the park for $5.<br/>
<br/>
Begin climbing at the beach.  Everyone will want to be your guide, <br/>
but this is not required.  Just watch the other climbers around you.  <br/>
When you get to the bridge that crosses the river, proceed another <br/>
100 feet or so and you will see a wooden porch on the left side of <br/>
the river.  <br/>
<br/>
At the far corner of the porch, a 4x4 support holds up the porch.  It <br/>
is clearly labeled #5 if you look at it.  There are two rocks at the <br/>
base of this post.  Between the rocks and the post is what you seek.  <br/>
<br/>
The evergreen stamp is appropriate for this spot, where the trees are <br/>
all evergreen, all year long.<br/>
<br/>
If you find this stamp, please stamp in quietly, finding a time to <br/>
put the box back when others are not watching will be a challenge.  I <br/>
would also appreciate a note via email, as I do not know when I may <br/>
be able to return to this beautiful spot.  <br/>
<br/>
Please write me at the email address above.     <br/>
