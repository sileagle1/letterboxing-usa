                    <div class="plaintext-content">I planted 3 new boxes in Baton Rouge, Louisiana today:<br/>
<br/>
Big Bang in a Little Box (ultra-micro box)<br/>
Breaking News (with my best carved stamp so far)<br/>
"Taking Orders" Series - One from Column A (B is already placed and <br/>
C will come this weekend - all are microboxes)<br/>
<br/>
The clues for all three are on www.letterboxing.org.  Remember that <br/>
to find the listings for Louisiana boxes you can't just click the <br/>
map.  You must use the "Search for Boxes" link at the page and <br/>
choose Louisiana for the state.  That will give you about 30 boxes <br/>
as opposed to the 5 you get from the map.  <br/>
<br/>
Sadly, I found that my first plant - The Old One - has gone missing <br/>
after just 2 months, and with only 2 visitors.  C'est la vie.  I <br/>
left it on the clue site but marked it as missing in both the Name <br/>
and the Clues.  I hope to recarve and replant nearby (I like the <br/>
clues.)<br/>
<br/>
I've also had a report that Fleur de Lis Pizza is also missing, <br/>
after only about a week and with no visitors at all that I'm aware <br/>
of.  I will try to confirm that this weekend.  I've marked it as <br/>
reported missing on the clue site.<br/>
<br/>
The next plant in this area will be "Stinkin' and Drinkin'", <br/>
hopefully to be planted this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting and planting!<br/>

P11 F2 - oops, is 13 bad?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Steve.  I'm not too upset about losing the boxes - I just <br/>
assume when I plant each one that I'll never see it again.<br/>
<br/>
Any Saturday in March except for Mar 6 is OK for me.  I do a radio <br/>
show every Saturday a.m. from 9 to 10, so I can't leave Baton Rouge <br/>
until after then.  Sundays are not so good, but if necessary I could <br/>
do any Sunday except Mar 21.  I could leave BR by 11 a.m. on a <br/>
Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
If you guys boil mudbugs for me, you will surely be my friends for <br/>
life!!!  Let me know what I can bring - appetizers, desserts, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What location do you have in mind?<br/>
