<br/>
We've been out searching for the Mt Vernon Trail LBs this week and <br/>
haven't had too much success so are curious if others know of their <br/>
status.  We're pretty sure we were at the right spots, but think <br/>
maybe the recent hurricane might have had something to do with them <br/>
missing.  If they are there, please let us know.  Thanks. <br/>
<br/>
We found the LB at Fort Hunt Park alive and well. <br/>
<br/>
However, we searched for the following and think<br/>
the boxes are missing.  We first went for the Runway<br/>
box at Gravelly Point.  We found the tree by the<br/>
river, but trash and seaweed were everywhere around<br/>
the fence &amp; tree, but no letterbox in site.  On the<br/>
way back to the car we found a stray black, shivering<br/>
kitten.   We think someone left it there on purpose so<br/>
we spent the next few hours finding an animal shelter<br/>
to take it in.  That was fun.  Of course we really enjoyed<br/>
watching the planes take off from Gravelly Point.<br/>
<br/>
Then this afternoon we went to search for the<br/>
letterbox at the Dyke Marsh Wildlife Refuge.  We got<br/>
toward the end of the trail where we searched all over<br/>
among the boardwalks strung all over (we think from<br/>
the hurricane this past summer).  We eventually found<br/>
the tall cedar trees and cleared the ground to find<br/>
the board stuck in the ground.  So from there we found<br/>
a small tree with rocks behind it, but no letterbox in<br/>
site.   We did enjoy watching 2 bald eagles and an<br/>
otter/beaver while we were searching for the box.  =-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please let us know if the boxes are still there.  <br/>
Thanks for the adventure.  <br/>
