I have seen these series before, and I have a suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
Since there are several parking locations, and you don't expect everyone to get all the boxes in one day for the most part, I would recommend one clue entry for each parking location.  That way people can record their finds one at a time as they work to complete the series.  <br/>
<br/>
If they were all reached from one parking lot, then I would say one clue entry with multiple boxes.  Or if it is planned for people to find all the boxes in a particular order within half a day, then one clue with multiple boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Make the names of the clues start with the same words.  That way people can find all the clues that make up the series by sorting alphabetically<br/>
<br/>
Show a diagram of the completed size in each box so people can reserve a big enough space for the completed image.<br/>
<br/>
We had a series in CT like that.  When completed it showed the inage of a gazebo, and each box was at a gazebo.<br/>
