                    <div class="plaintext-content">While walking the Bear Creek trail In Keller today, I checked on my 4  <br/>
letterboxes there and discovered 3 of the 4 poorly rehidden, clearly visible to  <br/>
anyone who took those little trails off the main trail, which walkers and kids  <br/>
playing in those woods often do!  I recovered two of them and left them in  <br/>
place, but I removed Autumn Gift to find it a better placement.  It was  sitting <br/>
right out on top of the pile of leaves behind the Eastern Red Cedar  tree, <br/>
clearly in sight and ready to be discovered, and the big rock and  bark that had <br/>
previoiusly covered it and marked its location were completely  missing.  <br/>
Since those 4 boxes were my first to place, and the Autumn Gift  stamp was the <br/>
best of the 4, I don't want to risk leaving it in a vulnerable  place.  I will <br/>
rehide it as soon as a new location presents itself.   Sorry for any <br/>
inconvenience to anyone who intended looking for it today, but it  will be out there <br/>
again soon and hopefully, finders will be very careful to  replace all of these <br/>
and other boxes carefully, and RECOVER WELL.   Thanks,  Viewfinder<br/>
