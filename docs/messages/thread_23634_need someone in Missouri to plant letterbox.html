VW Serinity series. I was going to try and collect stamps 1-3 in the<br/>
next few weeks as I travel from Denver to St. Louis. i could easily<br/>
plant the last box for you. Your email address was private so i<br/>
couldn't email you, but I will send you a private message or feel free<br/>
to email me.<br/>
