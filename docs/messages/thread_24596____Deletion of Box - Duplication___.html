AQ. (This is one box) This box is in Bowdoin Park in Wappingers Falls, <br/>
NY. I noticed the duplication when I was looking at the info on the <br/>
next gathering there. <br/>
<br/>
It is ALSO listed as one of the 9 boxes in the "Spring Is Here: Nature <br/>
Trail (9)" <br/>
<br/>
This is a duplication. If your find for the deleted box is deleted on <br/>
AQ, you can type "Spring Is Here: Nature Trail (9)" into the find box <br/>
on AQ and re-record the find for this particular box. Or you may also <br/>
have a duplication. <br/>
