I've actually considered getting those Iron-on Sheets you can print images <br/>
too (then iron on to a T Shirt, mousepad etc)... The Iron on toner trick <br/>
didnt work for me either.<br/>
<br/>
Ahh the joys of experimentation.  ;-)<br/>

One rainy Saturday afternoon, I decided to take two very simple images I <br/>
created and printed off on my Lexmark inkjet printer and transfer them to a <br/>
couple of different types of carving medium (white plastic erasers and pink <br/>
carving medium) that I had on hand. I did not know about the acetone method, <br/>
but remembered reading somewhere about transferring using regular household <br/>
white or cider vinegar.<br/>
I put the images face down on both pieces, took a cotton ball saturated with <br/>
vinegar and dabbed the images and they did transfer. It does take a while to <br/>
dry and this method may not be as smudge-proof and permanent as acetone. <br/>
This was particularly true of the pink carving medium which has a glossy <br/>
finish. My designs were experimental and simple and I have yet to try this <br/>
method on something more complicated that requires more handling of the <br/>
medium.<br/>
