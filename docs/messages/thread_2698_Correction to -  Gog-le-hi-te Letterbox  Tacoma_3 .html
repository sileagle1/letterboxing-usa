                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry folks....the first clue had a reversed compass bearing. The good news<br/>
is you would know right away that it was goofy and then doubt every clue<br/>
from that point on. Okay, not really good news. Sorry and thanks to Amanda<br/>

In the language of the local Puyallup Indians, "Gog-le-hi-te" means "where<br/>
the land and waters meet." This tidal marsh and mudflat is on the eastern<br/>
shore of the Puyallup River just south of Lincoln Avenue.<br/>
<br/>
The site was created by the Port of Tacoma to make up for habitat that was<br/>
lost when the Sea-Land Terminal was built in 1984.<br/>
Gog-le-hi-te provides habitat for a wide range of shorebirds, migratory<br/>
birds, salmon and flatfish.<br/>
Public access to the site is via Lincoln Avenue. Free parking is provided.<br/>
Low tide is an excellent time to view a variety of waterfowl.<br/>
<br/>
Can you find it?  Easy flat walk. Less than an hour to complete...maybe.<br/>
