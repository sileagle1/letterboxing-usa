                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also object to using wipes -- though for a different reason. Wipes always <br/>
have a scent, either from the perfume added to them or, even in the case of <br/>
"unscented" wipes, from the soap and chemicals in the wipe. When <br/>
backpacking in bear country, experienced hikers know to use a "bear bag" at <br/>
night -- putting all food and scented items in a bag and stringing it <br/>
between two trees out of reach of curious bears. Deodorant, lotion, <br/>
mosquito repellent, after shave, soap, and detergent are all items that you <br/>
should stow each night in your bear bag. Bears and other wild critters can <br/>
pick up on odors from these products that humans might not even smell -- <br/>
and an airtight container doesn't block the scent. Using wipes to clean a <br/>
stamp in a letterbox can leave a trace scent that sends a signal to all <br/>
critters in the area that there's something interesting waiting to be explored.<br/>
<br/>
For that reason, I think wipes should be avoided. Better to carry a <br/>
dampened paper towel in a plastic baggie.<br/>

Damp paper towels are easy to carry along in a baggie of their own.<br/>

I've seen those, too, and figured they would leave a scent just like <br/>
moist towelettes do because there are chemicals in the bottled <br/>
cleaner, too.<br/>
<br/>
I use my dust rags, which are old t-shirts and dry-rotted pillowcases <br/>
that I have ripped into washcloth-sized pieces that I dust with <br/>
because they're so soft, easily washed and re-used, and better for <br/>
the environment than using a dozen paper towels. They also come in <br/>
handy to wipe off stamps with, and I suppose I could use them for a <br/>
bandage if I came to some harm while searching through hill and dale <br/>
for a box! (Don't laugh, I've had my moments!)<br/>

Amy and I use, I believe, that very cleaner.  It's good for store <br/>
bought stamps however I wouldn't use it on hand carved stamps.  We're <br/>
afraid to much rubbing and the cleaning solution may be to much for <br/>
some crumbly(sp) materials.  <br/>
Just a thought. <br/>
