Putting on Mod Hat...<br/>
<br/>
The only way to fix the DB is to either delete it and<br/>
start over, or remove each entry by hand. I tried<br/>
exporting the data to a table, taking out the crap,<br/>
and importing it back, but all that did was add the<br/>
good records a second time. There does not seem to be<br/>
a tool to replace the records. I'd restart it, but the<br/>
only way to ensure that this does not happen again is<br/>
to ensure that only the table owner can add records,<br/>
and that would be a lot of work for one person to take<br/>
on, and I for one do not have the time.<br/>
<br/>
Abacus, would you like to delete it entirely or do you<br/>
want to try to fix this somehow?<br/>
<br/>
To the person that did this, you'd better hope we<br/>
don't find out who you are. This sort of childish<br/>
behavior has no place on this list, or on our website.<br/>
Whether or not you like the idea or agree with it is<br/>
irrelevant. We must respect each other here, and this<br/>
sort of activity is inexcusable. Don't like it, don't<br/>
participate. <br/>
<br/>
Over the course of the last few weeks, the posts on<br/>
the group have started to get out of hand. We can<br/>
agree to disagree here. Name calling, even politely<br/>
veiled, is not appropriate. I urge everyone, if you<br/>
read a post and it gets your blood going, walk away<br/>
from the computer, and come back in an hour. You may<br/>
discover that you don't care nearly as much as you<br/>
thought.<br/>
<br/>
To the new members, please keep in mind that many of<br/>
the people on this list have been long involved in<br/>
this group, as well as in this hobby, and many of the<br/>
ideas we've been tossing around the last week or so<br/>
have been discussed before, and settled. No way for<br/>
you to know that, of course, but that's part of what<br/>
it is to be new. Don't take offense.<br/>
<br/>
To the older members, we need to remember what it was<br/>
like when we first discovered this wonderful passtime,<br/>
how we were so excited to get started, full of ideas<br/>
about how to do it, and the thrill of that first "F"<br/>
and "P". They want to help, and, as someone recently<br/>
pointed out, letterboxing has evolved over the years,<br/>
and maybe one of these ideas will be really cool and<br/>
improve the enjoyment of all. But we won't know that<br/>
if we chase them away, or sabotage them.<br/>
<br/>
Please, everyone, play nicely, be polite and<br/>
respectful, and go find a box. Or, better, go plant<br/>
one!<br/>
