First, if you do happen to have Michael's craft stores in your area, I will<br/>
admit that I did not find carving tools/supplies until my 3rd trip to the<br/>
store, because they are not (at least in our local store) located with the<br/>
"rubber stamp" stuff, but rather with the oil paints etc.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I personally love the PZ cut "thin white stuff" for a medium, and I<br/>
am absolutely enthusiastic about being able to support small businesses such<br/>
as April's. The stuff comes in 4x10 sheets, which is good for a lot of<br/>
stamps, and costs $5.00 a sheet for "A" grade or $3.00/sheet for "B" grade<br/>
(which I've used, and which works fine, I think, unless you're a true<br/>
"artistie" stamp carver who insists on always making a good impression!).<br/>
She basically stuffs as much as she can into a priority flat-rate envelope<br/>
(up to 5 sheets) and ships for $3.85.  She also carries basic carving tools.<br/>
And no, I don't think I'll get a discount for plugging her stuff! I just<br/>
like it, and it's a good deal.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't have any tools, I recommend getting a nib holder, a #1 gouge<br/>
(aka "liner") and maybe a #5 gouge. You can also achieve good (and somewhat<br/>
different) results with x-acto-type knives, but I think the speedball gouges<br/>
are easier for beginners.<br/>
