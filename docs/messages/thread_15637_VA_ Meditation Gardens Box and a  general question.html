                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Hi all, Saturday we were going to take my youngest daughter for a pony<br/>
ride but got stuck in air show traffic, and they closed before we could get<br/>
there so we decided to try the meditation garden box in that general area.<br/>
Alas, we had no luck. We believe that it may have been removed when they<br/>
were fixing up the waterfall. The place itself was gorgeous. We were<br/>
wondering if anyone else had attempted this box recently?<br/>
<br/>
  Also, I was wondering about guidelines (I know there are no hard fast<br/>
rules!!J ) about placing boxes in the same area. I was trying to plant one<br/>
in Chesapeake this weekend, but as Im relatively unfamiliar with the city,<br/>
and the one park I know well was under construction in the hiking area, and<br/>
the rest was WAY to populated to attempt to hide anything. I think my new<br/>
box will go in my local water access park. The other box there is mine, as<br/>
well. Do I mention the other box in my clues? Do I link them though they<br/>
have nothing in common other than a placer? How many boxes are too many in<br/>
one area? (Not enough for me down here, esp.. as I cant hunt my own boxes!)<br/>
I did look for my answers in the archives, but, either this hasnt been<br/>
covered yet, or Im not adept at the searching for answers. The latter could<br/>
easily be the case, lol! Anyway, Im eager to hear any suggestions!<br/>
