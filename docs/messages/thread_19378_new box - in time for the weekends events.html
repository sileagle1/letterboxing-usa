Bucks County News - Headline January 20, 1922 Wild Cat caught in <br/>
Tinicum Twp. Rare Animal, Suppose to be Nearly Extinct, Trapped by 16 <br/>
year old Lad. <br/>
<br/>
Tunis Brady 16 year old son of Joseph, on Cook premises, on the edge <br/>
of the State Auxiliary game preserve in the tinicum boulder field is <br/>
where this lad trapped his fame. <br/>
<br/>
If it was true. This capture is said to be the only authenticated <br/>
taking of a wild cat anywhere in the county said Game Protector <br/>
Warren Fetz. But he wanted to see it with his own eyes he followed <br/>
the well-marked trail and passed the boulder field on the left and <br/>
continued down the rock-strewn trail. <br/>
For three years residents have known of some strange wild creature, <br/>
which uttered an "unearthly" yell at night. So terrifying most people <br/>
didn't go outside after dark.<br/>
Young Brady tracked two animals passed some huge rocks. He mentioned <br/>
they had sprung the traps three times without getting caught. They <br/>
continued on as Tunis explained that the male was securely caught <br/>
with one hind foot in the trap and that he had attempted to kill it <br/>
with a club, but the animal put up such a fight that the boy feared <br/>
he would break free of the trap so he procured a rifle and shot the <br/>
animal in the head. He believed his female companion was not far <br/>
watching him from the streams edge in the rocks. <br/>
They crossed a large rock bed where water flows and followed a thin <br/>
trail to the left.<br/>
Just down a root-strewn trail to the right in a pile of rocks he saw <br/>
the "trap" Fetz took out a notepad he had carried with him and began <br/>
to document the animal. The cat had powerful claws and teeth, and it <br/>
heads is large in proportion to its body. It apparently has not an <br/>
ounce of surplus flesh, being sinewy and wiry, and yet weighs eight <br/>
and a half pounds. Its body length is 20 inches and it stands 13 <br/>
inches high. Its front legs are seven inches long and its back legs <br/>
are 13 inches long. Its fur was a sandy gray, with some yellow and <br/>
buff color, but particularly noticeable is the dark line that runs <br/>
from the shoulder down the spine to the end of the tail. The top of <br/>
its head is black and its white and bristly feelers were stiff and <br/>
rather abundant. <br/>
The capture of the Nockamixon wild cat is most likely to cause a stir <br/>
in scientific circles, because of the rarity of the incident.  The <br/>
carcass will be in the possession of the Game Protector and will be <br/>
exhibited at the Bucks County Fish, Game and Forestry Association <br/>
meeting. My favorite part of this true story is that Miss Elizabeth <br/>
C. Cox of Holicong writes an article to appear in the following <br/>
paper. "Species Not So Nearly Extinct as Many Naturalists Think. Its <br/>
Habits are Nocturnal". She refers to the Philadelphia Zoo were a <br/>
species called the "Indian Devil" a cat smaller than a bobcat yet <br/>
still very wild was kept in captivity. She mentions that at night she <br/>
carries a pistol as protection against such cats, she also warns if <br/>
you have meat in your carriage to throw the meat to it and get away <br/>
as quickly as possible. She says these cats are by no means uncommon <br/>
here; just simple nocturnal. Miss Cox is a most careful investigator <br/>
and a most conscientious naturalist in Bucks County, and hoped that <br/>
other naturalist make similar inquires. Love the fact that it was a <br/>
woman who figured this out. <br/>
My question now  where is this stuffed wildcat today?? <br/>
