toys.  And we don't have to fill up the landfills anymore.  We(kids) <br/>
will just trade them.  So can we start going back to McDonalds again. <br/>
I just love their fries and M&amp;M McFlurry.<br/>
<br/>
Thank God there are some kids on this board. Hey, rnrB and trkr, I <br/>
like your Mom. She is smart too!  She knew just what I was talking <br/>
about. Does she take you to play minature golf? My Dad takes me <br/>
because my Mom just hates it. <br/>
<br/>
Tell me if you have any luck finding letterboxes with cool stuff in <br/>
it.<br/>
