San Luis Obispo County, California<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: easy walking, flat<br/>
Clues: easy <br/>
<br/>
pandora and members of "GoogleD" have planted a letterbox in a very <br/>
special place on highway 1 between two beaches, one of which you <br/>
might know as the "clam capitol."<br/>
<br/>
In this very special grove, you will find creatures that have shed <br/>
their cocoons and dared to be who they are.<br/>
<br/>
When you find the grove enter and follow the path.  You should see an <br/>
area meant for an audience.  Stand in front of the semi-circle and <br/>
look off to your left: you will see a traffic sign.  Note the number.<br/>
<br/>
Head on down to the far west picnic tables (within your sight) and <br/>
have a seat facing north.  You should see a yellow sign.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that number from earlier?  Take that number and double it.  <br/>
Now take that number and separate the digits then add them together.  <br/>
Now subtract the result from the one you just separated.  Got the <br/>
number?  Add to that the number of the highway you are on for a final <br/>
sum.<br/>
<br/>
That many single paces due south from the sign you are facing, you <br/>
will see a tree that looks to have a butterfly landed at the bottom <br/>
with wings spreading east.  Around that butterfly you will find your <br/>
own inside the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
<br/>
** A special thanks to my good friends JugglerMouse, Sir Balthazar <br/>
and Ash for suggesting this location, showing me where it was and <br/>
helping plant the letterbox."<br/>
