Just a reminder, if you haven't done so already, please drop me a <br/>
note off-list if you plan to take part in learning how to make hand-<br/>
bound books. The cost is $2 to cover materials. I plan to start the <br/>
class at 3:00 p.m. after we've all exchanged and enjoyed the bounty <br/>
provided by the Great Chefs of Letterboxing. The class will take <br/>
about an hour depending on questions, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I've put together  25 "kits" in order to keep everyone on the same <br/>
page (bad pun...sorry). In terms of covering bookboard, as you'll <br/>
see, that part of the process is pretty intuitive. Sewing the book <br/>
together is not. I've included in the kit, with her generous <br/>
permission, hand-bound book-maker extraordinaire,Ann Kingman's <br/>
(www.annkingman.com) instructions for making a Coptic Stitch book <br/>
from beginning to end. We'll be concentrating on the sewing part and <br/>
you'll go home with a small sample book. <br/>
<br/>
As far as what to bring, if you have large blunt point tapestry <br/>
needles, bring them, though I should have enough to go around. <br/>
Thread, paper and covers are included in the "kit." I've also created <br/>
a miscellaneous information sheet listing suitable material <br/>
substitutes, links, hints and resources. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to having fun with this. You'll be amazed at how easy <br/>
it is to make your own books, journals or even photo albums with this <br/>
simple method.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, please contact me off list.<br/>
