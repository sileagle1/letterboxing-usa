                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey kids, here is a scenario for the Kids Corner virtual letterbox<br/>
hunt.<br/>
<br/>
The kids (animals or whatever) stand poised reading the map just<br/>
like the current Pooh group.  When you click on the map this takes you to the <br/>
next scene, perhaps a 4-way sign with a visible set of clues and arrows pointing<br/>
different directions that you can go.  The map and compass are always visible as<br/>
well as the magnifying glass.<br/>
<br/>
Clicking on the compass could perhaps give you a brief tutorial on compass use<br/>
-- a blow-up perhaps: "This is a compass, the red arrow always points north,<br/>
etc, etc." <br/>
Clicking on the map could give you the overhead view of the overall scene<br/>
(actually it would zoom you back and show you the original map with a mark<br/>
showing where you are now at, like the directory maps you look at when you're in<br/>
the mall).  Clicking on the magnifying glass could zoom you in to show more<br/>
detail.  Clicking on an arrow could move you to a new spot in that direction. <br/>
Clicking on a stop sign could make you go back to the beginning.  <br/>
<br/>
These are just some options.<br/>
<br/>
There could be dead ends and pitfalls just as there would be in real life if you<br/>
don't understand the clues or take wrong turns.  As you find the box it could<br/>
open to reveal contents similar (except in animated form) to Erik's picture at<br/>
top of http://www.pclink.com/elf/getstart.htm Then clicking on the individual<br/>
objects could blow them up to reveal more information or to give a more detailed<br/>
explanation of what the object is or instructions on how to create the objects,<br/>
the stamp in particular.<br/>
<br/>
The final surprise is the stamp image itself.<br/>
<br/>
This entire adventure I would think could be represented by 12 to 15 images,<br/>
allowing a half-dozen or so dead ends.  Elements of the pictures could be<br/>
learning links: in particular, the compass and the letterbox which could open to<br/>
explain the use of a compass or the composition of a letterbox and explanation<br/>
of its contents.<br/>
<br/>
If we're clever we could arrange for the compass bearings (as depicted in the<br/>
images) to relate to actual lines of site in those images.  In other words, the<br/>
clue reads, "Bear ESE for 20 paces toward the dead oak tree." A dead oak tree<br/>
would be visible in the image near the lower right portion of the drawing.<br/>
<br/>
The drawing would not have to be perfectly reckoned or proportional.  It could<br/>
be similar to Sheila's Family map at http://www.pclink.com/elf/plano.htm#wdrfmap<br/>
The difference is it would be scaled up a bit with the search party and their<br/>
tools visble (large enough so you could click on these objects to learn more<br/>
about them).<br/>
<br/>
Another thought would be to leave the clues set visible off to the side so that<br/>
they are visible throughout the adventure.  When you think of it<br/>
this is the way it would be if you were actually on a hunt.  You would always be<br/>
able to glance down and see your clues set.  The clues could include landmarks<br/>
that (when not visible in the current scene) could indicate to you that you are<br/>
perhaps in the wrong place.<br/>
<br/>
These are just some brainstorming thoughts.  Throw some more out there if you<br/>
would.  We can revisit this as many times as we need to until we have a lot of<br/>
good ideas and then perhaps we can start to reduce this down to a working<br/>
model.  Don't be afraid to criticize these thoughts.  Is this too complicated? <br/>
Is this not what some of you were thinking?  I don't know.  This is what I've<br/>
been thinking, but I'm not an artist and I don't know if it is even feasible to<br/>
make everything visible with enough detail to make this a useful and fun<br/>
learning tool that will interest the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Daniel<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  The more I think about this, this whole scene could be simple enough to not<br/>
be beyond the kids, but it could also be informative enough to not bore the<br/>
adults.  I, for one, still like simple instructions with animated pictures that<br/>
can be plainly understood.<br/>

FWIW, I would suggest designing the adventure independent of the images, <br/>
if that makes sense.  If that doesn't make sense, it just means mock up<br/>
the flow of what you are doing with text hyperlinks that represent images<br/>
first; you could prolly test 10 or 15 different scripts of the adventure<br/>
to see what works best in the time it takes to create a single image.  That <br/>
way, people who are not artistic could contribute ideas for how the <br/>
adventure flows, and verse-visa, if appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Just a random thought :-)<br/>

OK, thought well taken.  Let's keep this in mind - could save a lot of<br/>
wasted drawings and draft schemes.  I need a little more detail though<br/>
Randy.  Would this just be clues sets (maybe with an image description<br/>
or story board w/o image) where you would have options to link to the next <br/>
scene??  Then once we like the adventure we would go back and create the art?<br/>
Am I hearing it right?  If not, could you give a little more detail of what<br/>
you have in mind?  Or perhaps you could start one with a link or two?? That<br/>
would be even better.<br/>
