                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I agree.  I like the flags because no matter where I am, I can pop onto<br/>
any computer and see which one I haven't had the honor of finding.  I<br/>
like it so much that I went back through and put in all the boxes we<br/>
have found in the last three years so we could keep better track. I had<br/>
been doing this with lists taped to our office wall in the last two<br/>
homes we've lived in.  <br/>
<br/>
Life is short, and I, too, appreciate all the wonderful places I never<br/>
would have gotten to see had I not had this hobby.  I appreciate all the<br/>
time I have gotten to spend with my kids derived from THEM wanting to do<br/>
this...little green flags aren't worth getting upset over.<br/>
