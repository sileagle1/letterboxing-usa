                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to all who responded to my idea about a hitchhiking letterbox<br/>
with a camera in it. After lots of good ideas and suggestions, I've<br/>
decided that for the first time out, I'll try this one as a snail mail<br/>
box. It seems that it would be difficult to have as a hitchhiker and I<br/>
think the pictures would end up being pretty boring if it was a<br/>
stationary letterbox. I'll start out by sending it out to 13 people,<br/>
each of whom will be responsible for taking 2 pictures - one of<br/>
themselves and one of something else - nothing obscene of course -<br/>
although I liked someone's suggestion of a Larry Flynt letterbox<br/>
someday :) To keep the box moving fast a list of the addresses will be<br/>
sent with the box, so if you don't want your address shared with 13<br/>
other letterboxers, don't send me your contact info. At the end, I'll<br/>
have the box sent back to me and I'll develop the pictures and post<br/>
them online. Of course, if there's someone who's willing to be the<br/>
designated thirteenth person, I can include a self-mailer to have them<br/>
sent in to snapfish, they can replace the disposable camera and it can<br/>
go to an additional 13 people before returning to me. If you are<br/>
interested, please e-mail me your mailing address. Thanks!<br/>
