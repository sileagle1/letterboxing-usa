Cliff Walk -- found by Moonstone Baby around June 2002.<br/>
Fast Passage: Breton Reef -- found by Moonstone Baby December 10, <br/>
2002.<br/>
Fast Passage: Castle Hill -- found by Musicwoman Fall 2002.<br/>
Fort Adams -- found by Moonstone Baby November 7, 2002.<br/>
Land Sailing Newport -- found by Mary Manatee November  2002.<br/>
Mothball Fleet -- no info, although I seem to remember someone (Jay?) <br/>
saying it has to be approached from a different direction than <br/>
indicated in the clue because of increased security.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone offer more recent info?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we'll run into some of you out there on the hunt!<br/>

letterbox but I believe you will not be able to get on base to find <br/>
the Mothball Fleet box.  Security is very tight.  There are armed <br/>
military guards at the gates. A military badge is required for <br/>
entry.  <br/>
<br/>
even if you could get on (which I doubt) the route in the clues is <br/>
barracaded in places with no entry.  <br/>
<br/>
I do not think it is a wise idea to be searching under rocks and <br/>
trees on a military base during this tense time. Your intentions may <br/>
be misunderstood.<br/>
<br/>
there are many other wonderful letterboxes in this area with <br/>
beautiful views of Narragansett bay &amp; the Atlantic Ocean. ALl of the <br/>
other boxes listed below are in beautiful public spots.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
  I do wish I had joined the conversation a day or so sooner. My <br/>
husband and I spent a frigid weekend (Feb. 14th-Feb.16th) <br/>
letterboxing in Newport. Glorious adventure! It was snowy but the sun <br/>
relecting off all that whiteness was gorgeous. We found Hanging Rock, <br/>
one of the Fond Farewell series. I scrambled up to the Fort Adams <br/>
letterbox and upon returning to the car got interrogated by a park <br/>
ranger.  We had drivien unintentionally into a restricted part of the <br/>
park. How embarrasing..tried to explain to the guy what letterboxing <br/>
was-then worried he would take the box away!  Nope, he just thought I <br/>
was a nutcase and sent us on our way.We bagged the Fort Psassage <br/>
letterbox in a Breton Point State Park.  I long to visit the Japanese <br/>
garden in summertime.  The bones of its design shown quite clearly, <br/>
even in several inches of snow.  The letterbox at Purgatory Point is <br/>
definately gone. Hopefully we will visit Newport again this spring. <br/>
The Norman Bird Sanctuary is an incredible spot to hike through and <br/>
I'd love to check out the migrating bird population.  Oh..left a <br/>
hitchhiker during ourlast visit. Hope it finds a new home soon!<br/>
