Notes:<br/>
These boxes are hidden in Fort Worden State Park in Port Townsend. I <br/>
grew up one block from that park, and it was basically my backyard. I <br/>
love to go back there and tromp around. For years, my family owned <br/>
the original guard house for the Fort -- we used it for a tack shed <br/>
for all our horse stuff. I did all my running in that park, and spent <br/>
many happy days on the beaches there. My mother recently called the <br/>
head park ranger there up to see if they'd like the guard house back <br/>
to renevate and put back in the park for the Centennial Celebration <br/>
they are having this year.<br/>
<br/>
My husband carved the Guard House stamp. Some things I know about the <br/>
guard house itself... My grandfather, who was chief of police in Port <br/>
Townsend for a long time, once caught a guard sleeping in the chair <br/>
and took the chair away... Another guard shot himself in the guard <br/>
house -- it is not known, as far as I am aware, if it was suicide or <br/>
an accident.<br/>
<br/>
I carved the Leaf stamp (and thus is it is nowhere near as good as <br/>
the one carved by my graphic designer husband).<br/>
<br/>
Amanda from Seattle planted three boxes in this park, at the time I <br/>
am writing this (February 24, 2002) all three are in great shape, and <br/>
have lots of stamps in them. They are fairly easy to locate if you go <br/>
to the visitor center in the park and get the free map. I dragged my <br/>
mom and my husband all over the park today, finding them. The two I <br/>
planted are in vaguely the same area you'll be in looking for hers.<br/>
<br/>
When you find the Leaf and Guardhouse letterboxes, please drop me a <br/>
line to let me know if they are still in good shape... I live in <br/>
Seattle and thus checking up on them will be somewhat erratic.<br/>
