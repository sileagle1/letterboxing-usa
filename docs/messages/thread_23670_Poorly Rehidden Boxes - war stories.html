That's hilarious! <br/>
<br/>
One of mine was in a stump in an open park - no reason for anyone to happen<br/>
into it, digging past the bark and the slate, but apparently many did. <br/>
Turns out there was a geocache really close by.  However, this box went<br/>
missing once.  The person that took it sent back one of my postcards saying<br/>
that they read the info about letterboxing, they might go put it back. <br/>
Another postcard came in the next day, dated later from that box.  So they<br/>
did, I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
A few months later, I went to pull it as the Lyndon City Fair was happening<br/>
and I was concerned about people happening in on the box.  An email had just<br/>
come in from the geocacher asking if I had brought the stump in the park<br/>
because she couldn't find a stump.  That's a funny sight in my head. The<br/>
electrical tent was there, next to the lb placement.  No stump!  No signs of<br/>
a stump ever having been there.  I'm in the middle of laughing, pulling the<br/>
2 other "you're close" film canisters and realized that the letterbox was on<br/>
the other side of the tree, with 4 twigs across the fairly large container. <br/>
Looking at the box was much like looking through open venetian blinds,<br/>
visible as can be.  The funny thing is that the box had been there for a<br/>
while, as evidenced by lbers and geocachers signing in.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta love it.<br/>

<br/>
I agree that there are lots of things that can contribute to a box <br/>
being poorly rehidden...but I had an experience recently that was so <br/>
bizarre I wonder if it's ever happened before: <br/>
<br/>
I have a box hidden in a fairly secluded spot in a public garden. In <br/>
another area of the garden is an Asian pond with a stone pagoda beside it. I<br/>
was enjoying the pond recently when I noticed what looked like a Ziploc bag<br/>
stuffed inside the pagoda. I was excited because I was pretty sure it was a<br/>
letterbox, but I was dismayed at the openness of the hiding place - it was<br/>
in plain sight. Imagine my surprise when I pulled it out and discovered it<br/>
was my ownletterbox! The last few entries in the logbook are hand-written<br/>
and unsigned...apparently a muggle found it and misinterpreted my<br/>
instructions to "re-hide it well" to mean "hide it somewhere else." What are<br/>
the odds that I would be the first to find it in it's new spot?? Needless to<br/>
say, I've changed my instructions to hopefully be more clear.<br/>

That's funny!  But we have a lber here who actually does fashion his <br/>
own stumps, so it's not impossible.  :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I posted a story on the LbNE board about a letterbox I <br/>
found yesterday that must have been found and re-hidden (I use that <br/>
term loosely) by the same joker who found that box Silent Doug and <br/>
Clueless found. You know, the one that made headlines on Mark &amp; <br/>
Sue's blog... where the box was hidden under a rock half its size... <br/>
completely exposed for all to see...<br/>
<br/>
This one was "hidden" just about as well, but it was actually worse <br/>
off than that other one. The lid on this letterbox was not snapped <br/>
on. The logbook had been placed right atop a bundle of baggies full <br/>
of ink, stamp and water. Orange ink, too! The chalky stuff!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if it was replaced like this in order to help it dry <br/>
out (the rain the night before kinda negated that idea)... since the <br/>
logbook being right on top most certainly saved it from being <br/>
soaked. The last finder was a kid who didn't stamp in; just wrote in <br/>
his name.<br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, I dried it and gave it new bags, then dug out some of <br/>
the dirt under the big rock and artfully piled as many rocks in <br/>
front of the hidey hole as I could and still keep it looking natural.<br/>
<br/>
Then today, I went out on Laurette's Sunday Drive and was very <br/>
pleased to see that all seven boxes we found were very well-hidden. <br/>
And had been for more than a year! Wow!<br/>
