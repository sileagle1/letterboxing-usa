<div>Just had a great day of letterboxing!! Hunted for 6 
boxes or "treasures" as my four year old and two year old like to call it. We 
had a ball! Didn't want the day to end! Unfortunately we only found 4 of the 
six. We still had a great time hunting the two we didn't find. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The two we had trouble with: </div>
<div>Bicentennial Pond in Mansfield. Fun clues and I am 
pretty sure we found the exact area in which it is hidden but when it came right 
down to it we just couldn't find the box. Could it be missing? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, Rubba Dub Dub planted by Chuck Straub and 
Molly. Couldn't find where it  could even be. I notice it was planted in 
February and I was wondering, could the hiding spot be camouflaged by the summer growth? Was I just missing something 
right in front of me? Beautiful walk though, I never knew it was there but plan 
to take it again real soon!</div>

<div>Thanks, </div>
