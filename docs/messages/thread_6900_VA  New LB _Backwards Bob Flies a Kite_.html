<br/>
Backwards Bob wanted to fly a kite, so he went to the most <br/>
popular place in Virginia Beach to do so.<br/>
<br/>
He parked right in front of a lighthouse and walked up a flight of <br/>
steps.  "Whew, I havent done that in a while, I need to sit down."  <br/>
He found a stone bench and sat a while to catch his breath.  The <br/>
bench was in front of a large tree, planted by a woman's society.  <br/>
As he looked at the tree, he heard the sounds of laughter and <br/>
playing to his left.  He looked a saw children playing in a wooden <br/>
cove.<br/>
<br/>
"That looks interesting"<br/>
<br/>
He got up and walked down the mountain, heading for this cove <br/>
that isnt a true cove.  He wandered around this fun place and <br/>
noticed another playground a distance away that didn't seem as <br/>
popular.  "How sad."<br/>
<br/>
He decided to swing on the neglected swings a bit discovered a <br/>
shady spot with a number 4 on it.<br/>
<br/>
"It's getting hot, I think I will go sit in the shade"<br/>
<br/>
To find the box, stand next to the pillar with the number 4 on it with <br/>
the pillar at your right hand.  Look across the shade to the pillar <br/>
directly in front of you.  Walk to it and turn left.  Walk past 4 pillars <br/>
and at the 5th, look up.  Log in and have a great time!<br/>
<br/>
When you see the stamp you will understand the "Backwards" <br/>
Part of the title.<br/>
