In Virginia’s mountains is a county named<br/>
For a natural formation just north of the James.<br/>
Visit its seat, its biggest town<br/>
Hunt down the gun with an old king’s crown.<br/>
<br/>
It squats on a lawn where two busy roads meet<br/>
Beside a stately brick building as red as a beet.<br/>
Walk to the door, of the forenamed.<br/>
Obey the sign there that guides the lame.<br/>
<br/>
A tribute to martyrs, their names in long lines<br/>
The date not 9/11, instead November 9.<br/>
Venture beyond, into the square<br/>
Through the shade, to a second wheelchair.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking roughly, four feet down and to the right,<br/>
Beneath a rusticated slab, your quarry’s in sight.<br/>
The square is busy; do take care<br/>
No idle eyes spy your business there.<br/>
<br/>
