...<br/>
Would it make sense to have it somehow as part of the e-mail map on the <br/>
home page? It almost seems more logical, rather than a single state<br/>
contact person, to have all in a given state, who are interested &amp; willing, to<br/>
have their contact info available? ...<br/>
...<br/>
What about a part of the web page that was something like "Meet the<br/>
Letterboxers", where the intros now being developed might reside, maybe<br/>
not quite as abbreviated in terms of one line of text, and, maybe a<br/>
place to display one's personal stamp ... <br/>
...<br/>
I think it might be interesting to have a place to display failures,<br/>
i.e., the backwards text, misspelling (did I mispell ' misspelling'?),<br/>
etc.  For the new stamp carvers, it might show how we can all make<br/>
'misteaks' (sic), might be fun, might make 'the perfect stamp' less<br/>
daunting of a goal...<br/>
<br/>
My comments:<br/>
I'd thought about the first 2 ideas already.  The 3rd one is good too.<br/>
I wonder though if we should give the first 2 ideas some more thought<br/>
(as to how).<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to explore the idea of emailing links to pages that "Introduce the<br/>
Letterboxers" rather than linking them with the web page -- to keep<br/>
it more interactive - more in the hands/&amp; process of our correspondence<br/>
rather than sitting out there for the whole world to see.<br/>
<br/>
I think to make this more clear, in general, you should look at<br/>
HOW these pages are sitting (by themselves):<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/label.htm<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/testform.htm<br/>
These are not linked to the main page or anywhere else, nor do they include any<br/>
links to anywhere else.  They're just sitting out there, not likely to be seen<br/>
by anyone unless somebody points them out in an email note.  That's what I'm<br/>
suggesting for the introductory information as well -- which may include stamp<br/>
samples, pictures, etc.<br/>
But I'd like to think about how to do this.  I think, when the web is<br/>
invloved, input forms are the way to go.  There could be an input form for this<br/>
eventually too, similar to the one being proposed for clues. <br/>
Again, the input form will not be a main link or appear on a main page.<br/>
If you want somebody to know about it you would have to email them and <br/>
say, "Hey, look here:"<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/testform.htm<br/>
<br/>
BUT, for<br/>
right now I had just planned to forward the info via email, mainly for new<br/>
members.  But to get this started I can post more detailed info for you<br/>
(including a stamp sample or picture if you want) elsewhere.  So then what comes<br/>
in an email may look something like this:<br/>
<br/>
Adrian (Have Feet Will Travel) Williams, Age 43, Dartmoor England: Manager &amp;<br/>
Letterboxer<br/>
mailto: adrian@letterboxing.freeserve.co.uk<br/>
http://easyweb.easynet.co.uk/~have.feet/letter/page2.html<br/>
<br/>
Notice it has the email link plus the link to Adrian's info (his page).<br/>
So then I would provide a similar page for each state or each person,<br/>
but it would not be advertised on the left-hand map on the main page.<br/>
The link would come in an email form only BY CHOICE (as intervened by us humans)<br/>
and as part of our ongoing correspondence.  Does this make sense?  It lends more<br/>
toward keeping the communication going rather than having some static system.<br/>
<br/>
Then you could sign-off with the links or pass them on in your correspondence. <br/>
You may even want to put it at the beginning of your note.  Its all optional<br/>
then.  There are many ways other ways to do this too.  As usual, comments, if<br/>
any you have, would be greatly and unequivocally appreciated.<br/>

I think this is a good idea. Some people are reluctant to discolse too<br/>
much personal info on open, easily-surfed web pages, for all sorts of<br/>
valid personal reasons.  What you suggest is a pretty good compromise -<br/>
presumably, the link might always be provided whenever an inquiry is<br/>
received from someone new, perhaps sent directly by one of us, not to<br/>
the whole Letterbox-USA group? I.E., ya gotta come forweard and show an<br/>
interest before you get to "meet us all" - is that what you had in mind?<br/>
To me, it seems to work just fine as a concept.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, to get it set up, first the proffer thru the talk (as you just<br/>
did recently) for some introductory bio info would be sent to all the<br/>
list. When it is established, following the above "rules" (so to speak),<br/>
the link should be mailed to all active participants? <br/>
<br/>
Not bad.<br/>

<br/>
I like the idea of including a web page reference along with the bio<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Then we can keep our ''Virtual Welcome Wagon'' short and sweet, knowing that<br/>
if anyone wants to learn more about us, they can check out our personal web<br/>
page.<br/>
<br/>
At each person's discretion, the personal web pages could either be self-made,<br/>
as in the example for Adrian, or they could be provided as part of the<br/>
Letterbox USA services, as Dan suggests.  There would certainly have to be<br/>
some constraints regarding length for pages provide by L-USA. They could be<br/>
done for each person, or for each state, although I tend to prefer individual<br/>
pages for each person, unless we can think of an efficient way to see that<br/>
people who provide their own pages also get included in the state-by-state<br/>
listings.<br/>

<br/>
This makes sense to me.  I think the contact people for both Washington and<br/>
California felt pressured by the responsibility of being the sole<br/>
representative for their state.  Fearing they could not meet future<br/>
expectations, they both chose to bow out rather than face the possibility of<br/>
letting someone down.  Here in Oregon, I am more than happy to represent our<br/>
hobby to newcomers in the area, but if I were on vacation or caught up in<br/>
bothersome ''extra-cyber'' responsibilities, a potential letterboxer could<br/>
just as easily learn everything they need to get started from my neighbor Thom<br/>
Cheney (assuming he has no objections to this... I'm just using him as an<br/>
example).  I think people will be more likely to volunteer if they know they<br/>
are part of a network of representatives for their area, rather than a<br/>
solitary contact person.<br/>
<br/>
Please take the following suggestion with a grain of salt... I don't want to<br/>
sound like a spokesperson for egroups or any other free email list service.<br/>
This is just an idea to consider:  We could set up any number of smaller<br/>
mailing lists for each state or any other specialty group (stamp carvers,<br/>
technical people, etc.)  This would provide two benefits, as I see it.  It<br/>
would provide a single mailing address that forwards messages to any number of<br/>
people who wish to be included, and it also provides better security against<br/>
''spam-bots'' that endlessly search the net for websites such as ours that<br/>
include links to personal email addresses.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I guess I missed that part by Erik initially.  I don't think it makes much<br/>
difference now because of the relatively small number of adherents.  I mean<br/>
right now being state contact has meant little more than (perhaps) getting<br/>
an email or two from interested people in one's state.  I think its an initial<br/>
contact thing more than anything.  So even if the number of people grows<br/>
appreciably... I don't know... I wonder what it will entail - probably not<br/>
that much even when it grows.  But some people may like the left-hand map<br/>
(the contact map) and may not want it changed.  I think if we do change it <br/>
should just be that clicking on a state would give you the option of<br/>
contacting several people instead of just one person.  I think that's what<br/>
your saying in essence, right?  So you could click on for instance Iowa,<br/>
and bring up a page of Iowa contacts, one of whom is primary.  For that<br/>
matter the list of people could show up right alongside of the state map.<br/>
For that matter each contact name could be color coded and correspond to<br/>
the dots on the map... just thinking out loud here.  Then again, like I<br/>
said earlier some people may not want it changed at all.  But I suppose<br/>
I could try a few of these options and put them out there for testing<br/>
to see what people like and don't like.  All in due time.  It all takes<br/>
time.  Too many irons in the fire right now I think.  Maybe a week or two<br/>
on that one.  I'm in Overtime mode at work right now and that usually<br/>
lasts a week or two.  But I will get to it, I promise.<br/>

That's it, Dan - for example, my name is on VT by virtue of being the<br/>
first here.Tom Cooch , for example, is equally - no, more active that I<br/>
ahppen to be at the moment. It makes sense to have both our names<br/>
available for local inquiries. <br/>
<br/>
Mitch wrote (this and more)...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Exactly.  If we set up 50 miniature talk lists (one for each state) we could<br/>
&gt;  just replace the contact person's email address with the address for the state<br/>
&gt;  talk list.  Then, an inquiry for the state of Iowa, for instance, would be<br/>
&gt;  forwarded to anyone and everyone interested in greeting a new person from that<br/>
&gt;  state. <br/>
and.....<br/>
&gt; Imagine how exciting it could be for someone who has just discovered the hobby<br/>
&gt;  to send a simple message requesting info... only to be greeted by two or three<br/>
&gt;  or half a dozen people in their area who are already involved.  Much better<br/>
&gt;  than receiving a reply from a single individual who may or may not have the<br/>
&gt;  time to deal with their request at that particular moment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mitch,  you are truely a global thinker!  While I hope that smaller<br/>
localized lists won't dilute the energy of the larger (goegraphically)<br/>
list we have now, I like your long-range visions. <br/>
<br/>
Isn't it interesting how one little snippet of an idea (in this case,<br/>
Dan'l's mini - bio's) growes into something so much larger so quickly.<br/>
Amazing.<br/>
