<div>I was thinking of a new challenge for following 
clues.  I realize that part of the challenge of the pacing is that people 
have different strides.  Then I realized something about my own 
background.  Although foresters and surveyors often measure by pacing, they 
never describe their distances in paces.  They use standard measurement 
units.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most forestry field camps have a lesson where the 
students are required to walk certain premeasured distances and calibrate their 
pace.  Once you know how to pace on level ground the next challenge is 
to learn how to compensate for slopes or even for running (in the case of 
Orienteering).  I thought it might be a new and interesting challenge for 
some of you if I did a set of clues using the measurement units of the U.S. 
Public Land Survey.  These units were devised by Thomas Jefferson who 
initiated the survey when he became president.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>They aren't common units like feet or yards.  
I won't mention the names of the units here.  Some of you might already 
know of them.  I'll even give you some hints on how to calculate them in 
the clues.  Half the fun would be researching what they are before going 
out.  The folks in Ohio and west of the Mississippi, would be more familiar 
with them.  That whole part of the country is divided that way.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Is this something new for most of you or is it 
common knowledge.  If that's the case, there are other alternative units 
that I can use such as a Texas Vara.</div>

<div>I welcome your input,</div>
