The smaller denominations were not real well received when I first set this <br/>
up. <br/>
I thought they would be great for kids and people like me who don't have a <br/>
lot of letterboxers around.<br/>
But I don't mind adding more denominations if the LbNA administrators and <br/>
webmasters are okay with it.  A poll anyone? 350 ?  Does someone want to set that <br/>
up?<br/>

We're right in there with Princess Lea. I've done the ordering for badges and <br/>
pins before and know it's expensive to make a changes and add new ones. You <br/>
have to buy a ton of them to make it pay too but I sure would like an F 300 and <br/>
an F 400 to work toward.<br/>
