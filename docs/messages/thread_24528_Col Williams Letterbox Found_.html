Cool!  Glad it turned up!<br/>

I read some discussion somewhere recently, that the phrase "rehide <br/>

I had given up one of my boxes for lost and recarved the <br/>
stamp and replanted it, only to be contacted by the park <br/>
months later that the original box had been found. turns <br/>
out a non-boxer had found the box and didn't quite get it, <br/>
they thought they were supposed to rehide the box in a <br/>
different location. very glad your box was found, congrats<br/>

I was ecstatic!<br/>
<br/>
The most plausible explanation we could come up with was that someone found it out in the open &amp; didn't know where it was supposed to go, so they did the best they could. <br/>

This is exactly why I've appended the following note to all my <br/>
letterbox clues:<br/>
<br/>
"Please stamp in away from the hiding place, and carefully avoid <br/>
making or at least try to conceal social trails to the letterbox--<br/>
especially in mud or snow!  Kindly reseal the Lock-n-Lock type box, <br/>
and re-hide the letterbox [exactly] where it was placed, covering it <br/>
well and contact the placer if you find any problems."  [Brackets <br/>
added for emphasis.]<br/>

Everyone must plant a box put it on the letterbox list check it out for a month or two before they look for a box.? If they know the time and personal attactment to a box they planted maybe they would be more careful with the boxes they find.?? Of course, no one can prevent animals from finding the box or for the weater that sometimes destroy boxes.<br/>

I just found out that someone planted a box in the location of one of mine,<br/>
with stickers in them. My clue says that it's missing and will be replaced<br/>
in August of 2007, and all of hte studden I start getting find reports. I<br/>
couldn't believe it. One of the notes says "Thanks for the stickers". I just<br/>
about fell out of my seat. I have never, and would never, hide a box with<br/>
