Ron,<br/>

Just wanted to say thank you for that series. It led us to beauty, <br/>
the stamps are wonderful, and very creatively hidden. To the north <br/>
of us, I believe you also are the one who placed Salmon Creek Falls. <br/>
Again, thank you for that one. Love your style, dude!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you are planning on attending our October 4th get together in <br/>
San Luis Obispo, CA. We will be putting out at least ten new boxes <br/>
(maybe more) for the event to tempt you and your tribe. Mostly, we <br/>
would love to get an exchange from you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for starting so much beauty.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely offered,<br/>
Sir Balthazar<br/>
