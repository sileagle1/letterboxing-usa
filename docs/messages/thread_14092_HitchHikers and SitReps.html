I think it may have been mystery boxes that people don't like the status for, <br/>
because it may lead to the location of the box (if you had gone to other <br/>
boxes in the same area for instance). <br/>

We cherish receiving Sit-Reps.  They are few and far between. There's <br/>
about 3 people out there that will email us when they go find the <br/>
boxes....and thats usually in the first week. We've decided to put <br/>
maybe 1 more HH out and thats it due to the fact that we have not <br/>
heard about our first HH since Patrick and Amy moved it to mansfield <br/>
(and I know someone has found it since).  Its discouraging <br/>
sometimes.  Also have not heard anything about Gray Rock extras and <br/>
very little about the large Avery Tract series.   <br/>
<br/>
I agree not to mention mystery finds...it will give a general locale <br/>
away. I don't think its a bad idea to wait a week or two and <br/>
say "within the past month we found XYZ mystery". Thats kind of neat! <br/>
I will say I look at all the sit-reps that people post in the CT / RI <br/>
area. You can pick up a lot of "what to expect" by reading these <br/>
reports. Its also nice to know whats hot and what has not had <br/>
visitors in a while.   <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Interesting thread about SitReps/mystery boxes.  I recently had <br/>
similar conversations with a couple of boxers out this way in regards <br/>
to folks listing the boxes they have found on their personal web <br/>
pages, and what the feeling was about including mystery boxes and <br/>
bonus boxes, which may have been found on the same date as other <br/>
boxes in the area, thus giving hint to the location of the mystery <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
My personal feeling is that if somebody is prudent enough to be doing <br/>
research on a box on the talk list and other 'boxers web pages, then <br/>
if they can garner a few hints to a mystery box in this way, more <br/>
power to them.  After all, a mystery box is about research and <br/>
keeping your eyes and ears open for clues.  <br/>
<br/>
But that is just my 2 cents, and may be greatly reflective of the <br/>
relatively small number of boxers and boxes in my area.  I certainly <br/>
can respect the viewpoint of those who wish for them to remain <br/>
unmentioned.<br/>
