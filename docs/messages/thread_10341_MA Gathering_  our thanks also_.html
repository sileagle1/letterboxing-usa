we missed exchanging with some of you who came in while we were out <br/>
scooping up those event boxes.  I can't believe I ate so much food.  <br/>
Thanks Rustypuff and CSCM for a great gathering.  We're thinking <br/>
about trying to organize a Cape Cod Gathering with some other locals <br/>
sometime this Spring.  And now back to counting my PFX'S!<br/>
