                    <div class="plaintext-content">I created a "Rummage Sale" LB for our yard sale this past weekend.  I<br/>
hid the box somewhere in our rummage sale and posted clues for other<br/>
LBers to come find it.  It was a lot of fun and I got to meet a lot of<br/>
new boxers in our area!<br/>
<br/>
Since we won't be having a rummage sale again soon, and the box is<br/>
just sitting here on a shelf, I am opening up this box for others to<br/>
use to do the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
If you are having a rummage sale (yard sale, garage sale, swap meet,<br/>
etc.) you may request to get this box from me to hide in your sale. <br/>
The only stipulations are:<br/>
<br/>
1) I will pay to ship the stuff to you.  You must pay to send it back<br/>
to me when your sale is over.<br/>
<br/>
2) I will only send the "insides" of the box (the contents) so you can<br/>
decide what unique "box" you want to put it in (like, maybe that old<br/>
coffee pot that no one will buy.  Just be careful that a<br/>
non-letterboxer doesn't purchase and take off with the box!)<br/>
<br/>
3) You cannot obligate anyone searching for the box to buy something<br/>
to get the box.<br/>
<br/>
4) The box is only for rummage sale "events".  It should not be used<br/>
for regular gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
5) When you have the clues done, send them to me and I will post them<br/>
on the LBNA and AtlasQuest site as a "USA Mystery box" so wherever the<br/>
box is currently, people that have found it can still keep track of it<br/>
as a find (one central location for the clues).  You are also<br/>
encouraged to post your clues to the LBNA and any local lists.<br/>
<br/>
6) If there are many requests for the box for the same weekend, I will<br/>
send it "first request, first served".<br/>
<br/>
I hope many get to enjoy this box!<br/>

I just might need that box this year.  A new job in a new town July 1 ... eventual move.  I <br/>
don't have too much to sell (last move 5 years ago) - but I will create stuff to sell, just to <br/>
have the LB available to my letterboxing buddies in town.  I will keep you posted.<br/>
<br/>
You might add another stipulation that "unsold treasures" are not returned with the <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
