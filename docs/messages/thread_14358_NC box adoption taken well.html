                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just want to say that the folks in NC were terrific about <br/>
my "adopting" of their boxes. I have not had a single negative <br/>
comment about my adopting of all the abandoned NC boxes. I have been <br/>
trying to contact all the original placers and have gotten great <br/>
feedback. Many are taking over their own boxes and were unaware of <br/>
the changeover at LBNA. <br/>
And I even had one email from someone who does not plan to be active <br/>
in letterboxing in the near future and wants me to keep on <br/>
maintaining their clues! <br/>
Thanks so much to the Laid Back and Easy-Going letterboxers of NC!! <br/>
