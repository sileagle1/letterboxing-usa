This isn't a virus.<br/>
It's someone trying to fool you into clicking "Yes" so they can send you to<br/>
a their page and sell you stuff and load spyware onto your computer.<br/>
<br/>
This webmasters didn't remove this box, nor return it to the website.  Your<br/>
computer wasn't trashed by a virus, either. It was trashed by a company name<br/>
nCase.  Go find their site and complain to them.<br/>
<br/>
A simple search of the text in the box gathered this information for me:<br/>
http://www.compukiss.com/ckmessageboard/messageview.cfm?catid=3&amp;threadid=343<br/>
<br/>
To quote them:<br/>
"MyDoom IS a real virus, BUT the "RPC Doom Virus" pop-up is just an AD. Just<br/>
some new technology to increase sales for these hopeless companies!! Since<br/>
there is no Close button in the window, just press Alt-F4 to close the<br/>
window; end of story."<br/>
<br/>
If your anti-virus software doesn't complain, then it's probably not a<br/>
virus.<br/>
In general, don't click Yes on boxes that pop-up on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
If you get 'infected' by a program of this sort, go get a spyware detector:<br/>
Ad-Aware:  http://www.lavasoft.de<br/>
SpyBot:     http://www.safer-networking.org/<br/>
<br/>
Get the Google toolbar:<br/>
http://toolbar.google.com<br/>
It block popups, so you wouldn't even see that ad in first place.  Plus, you<br/>
could have just typed the text of that box into the search box and found<br/>
many references to this being an ad.<br/>
<br/>
While I'm on my soapbox, here are some good practices:<br/>
 - If you have an always-on connection, you should have a firewall.<br/>
Zone-Alarm, Internet Connection Firewall (built into XP), or a hardware<br/>
(Netgear, D-Link, etc...) are all options.<br/>
 - Install anti-virus.  Leave it running all the time.<br/>
 - Visit http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com every two weeks, or if you hear<br/>
on the news about a new virus.  If you have XP and an always on connection,<br/>
schedule the updates for the middle of the night so you don't have to<br/>
remember.<br/>
 - If you have Word, Excel, or Outlook on your computer, go to<br/>
http://office.microsoft.com and update that software, too.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there are more, but if you do those basic things, you'll be a good<br/>
netizen by keeping your computer clean and happy.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Hi Webmasters,<br/>
<br/>
  I'm concerned that letterbox "Fish-or-mans Personal Traveler" is back<br/>
  on the website again!!!<br/>
<br/>
  I'm not going to click on it again and find out what happens.<br/>
<br/>
  Last time it was there, which was Thursday, I clicked on it and my<br/>
  computer was trashed. It was an expensive click on my part. My<br/>
  computer repair person said it was the "Doom" virus!! She e-mailed<br/>
  you on Thursday, telling you about it. The letterbox was then removed.<br/>
<br/>
  Thought you would want to know,<br/>
<br/>
  Regards,<br/>
