I hope somebody took pictures and will upload them to the files <br/>

<br/>
Yesterday was a great day and Celtic Pride and I claim bragging <br/>
rights as Pocahontas State Park Letterboxing Champions. We are the <br/>
only people so far who found all 8 boxes in one day.  It took us over <br/>
5 hours!!!! And that's with figuring out how to combine the routes to <br/>
some boxes so we didn't have to go back to the beginning to start on <br/>
the next box.  We saved miles of walking this way.  But still, for <br/>
those who are planning a trip to this park, leave a lot of time as <br/>
there is A LOT of walking.  It's also good to bring along a <br/>
determined Irish gal who will explore every pine tree in the park to <br/>
find where the "long meets the tall."<br/>
<br/>
And Ladybug, we used the last page of the logs in your Boxes #1 and <br/>
2.  We didn't have any extra paper to put in for the next people.<br/>
<br/>
And three cheers for NewBe1 and the fine photographer Dayze!  Thanks <br/>
for putting this together.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to meet all of you. <br/>

Oh..... how could I do that!  So sorry,  Celtic Pride was in <br/>
attendance as well.  (I forgot them because Biki and I had met <br/>
them prior to the gathering and when I went through my book to <br/>
write in names I started at the start of the gathering.)  OOPS!<br/>
