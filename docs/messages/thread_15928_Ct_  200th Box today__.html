                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Well, I planned very carefully what box would be my 200th find and <br/>
chose Chuck and Molly's "The Tree is Me."  Columbian Bugs had told me <br/>
it was awesome and it is. Plus, I could combine Railroad Crossing and <br/>
the 2 series temporarilly set out after the recent Ginger Meets Molly <br/>
Gathering (My Dogs are Barking trail and Chase the Tail trail).  <br/>
Those 2 series were particularly interesting due to the <br/>
cooperative/collaborative efforts of a number of letterboxers  <br/>
creating stamps for the series. <br/>
  Back to the topic of 200.  It had to be one of Chuck and Molly's <br/>
boxes. After all, his was the first letterboxer's website I ever <br/>
visited and read from A to Z. I frequently saw the unmistakable <br/>
vehicle Chuck drove, often in the Schoolhouse Brook parking lot.  <br/>
Since then I have met an incredible number of dedicated talented <br/>
letterbox placers.  For instance, lately, I've been hunting down <br/>
Irish Tinker l.b.s<br/>
  Here's to much more fall hiking and box finding before the snow <br/>
flies (and even after) for all of us. I  have orange plastic garden <br/>
spade..will dig for treasure. <br/>

Well, I planned very carefully what box would be my 200th find and <br/>
&gt; chose Chuck and Molly's "The Tree is Me."<br/>
<br/>
This remindes me of when my Dear Daughter Corrina surprised me by <br/>
planning my 200th find to be the "Mother and Daughter" letterbox. We <br/>
used to box together all the time, now our work schedules don't allow <br/>
it ;(.<br/>
Congratulations!!<br/>
