                    <div class="plaintext-content">Placed 3 more boxes in the Chuck's Tacklebox Series.  These <br/>
new boxes are located in Pierce County at Rapjohn Lake (1 box <br/>
so far, another to go there soon) and Tanawax Lake (2 boxes) <br/>
both near Graham, WA.  Clues on the new lbna site.<br/>
<br/>
I have 7 more stamps/boxes ready for launch in this series.  <br/>
Have to wait for a clear weekend away from work to get out there <br/>
and place them.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS.  A reminder, in this series one box in each pair is placed at <br/>
the public launch area that is accessable to non-boaters while <br/>
the other box in each set is located on the lake and does require <br/>
a boat to find.  It is my goal to give the fishing boxers out there a <br/>
good opportunity to enjoy both sports simultaneously.  For those <br/>
non boaters who would like to find the lake boxes, Tanawax has <br/>
3 different lake resorts that rent boats.  Other boxes to be placed <br/>
soon may have other rental boat opportunities but that is not my <br/>
main concern in placing the boxes.  My main concern is to place <br/>
boxes at the lakes that I enjoy fishing the most.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and let me know how you like them.<br/>
