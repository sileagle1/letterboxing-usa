                    <div class="plaintext-content">Found the Purple People Eater of Frying Pan Park yesterday (cheated <br/>
somewhat - went from near the end to the tree).  Was our second attempt <br/>
- had tried the wrong tree the first time.  Hope to go from the first <br/>
FPP box to it on a different day.  Very very cute stamp.  Glad I had my <br/>
purple stamp pad with me :-&gt;  Box &amp; contents were intact &amp; dry but box <br/>
was partly exposed; covered it up well in its previous location after <br/>
stamping in. <br/>
<br/>
Retired my Cox Farms Pumpkin Patch stamp this evening, at the end of a <br/>
fun Pumpkin Smashing on the last day of Cox's Fall Festival for this <br/>
year.  Many more visitors than we'd expected.  Exchanged with two of the <br/>
Doubtful Guests at the gate midafternoon.  Nice to have met you!  Yes, <br/>
let's have a NoVA meet before New Year's.  Thanks to all who came <br/>
looking for the Pumpkin Patch, especially those of you who had to come <br/>
more than once before finding it (since there's an entrance fee for <br/>
Cox).  If it's OK with Cox next year, I'll try to hide another box there <br/>
in a different spot.<br/>
