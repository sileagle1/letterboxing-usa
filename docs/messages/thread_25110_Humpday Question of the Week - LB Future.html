As far as Ryan deciding the future of letterboxing, I'm not sure he should get total blame for that.  After all, one person can't make anyone follow and just because AQ exists doesn't mean you have to use it.  But the fact that so many do, must mean that they prefer this style of letterboxing.  Maybe it is just the natural evolution of letterboxing that would have happened without AQ, but we will never know.<br/>

I'd like to ask questions like: Why has the the general population just excepted that one person making a profit off of our game been allowed to decide the future of what letterboxing is and will become? (I know this isn't really fair to ask right now, because that person is on vacation in Spain at the moment).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To build on what SE mentions, and to give Ryan some benefit of the doubt - the perception I have is that he is merely bowing to market forces (or one can say, following the $).  If the $ say, "we want cooties, boxing buddies and other things that purists may not consider letterboxing!", Ryan has no choice but to not alienate a paying customer base.  Money does talk, and it is his site and he does an excellent job creating it.<br/>
<br/>
In a way it is a vicious cycle (dumbing down may begat more dumbing down as the requests become more and more inane in the eyes of some).  Interestingly and perhaps ironically, some of those who hyperventilated for some of the cute dumb-downs are now starting to complain about some continued dumbing down themselves.  There is also the GC.com raised boxers who occiasionally attempt to influence the site towards being more like GC.com and this often leads to discussion.<br/>

Take it for what its' worth, as it is what it is.<br/>

One of the reasons I like AQ better is because of the nasty, negative, hateful people on this list. As far as Ryan making money goes - it's optional whether or not you buy a Premium Membership on that site. Nobody forces anyone.<br/>

I joined this list awhile back because I thought I could make friends and learn something.<br/>
I did learn something - too many of the people here are as described above.<br/>

Back when it was the only game in town, we knew the personalities of everyone on this list. <br/>
We recognized their tongue-in-cheek innuendo and recognized that this list was where part of the game was played. <br/>
We thought a post was firstly a clue, then a joke and then possibly a statement. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone joining after that time, from AQ or wherever, missed out because they didn't know the players, or they didn't understand this list or a combination of the two. And those of us still here just lost track of who is who among some of the new letterboxers, I guess. <br/>

Just an observation . . . <br/>

Coming out of lurkerdom and Donning Mizscarlet's armored underwear and<br/>
building on LB's comments, wouldn't it be wonderful to make money doing<br/>
something that we love?  I am not a fan of AQ and I have chosen to show<br/>
it by not paying to belong to it but there are reasons that I still use<br/>
it- I can access it from work being the main one.  But I have to admit<br/>
to a fair amount of envy when I think about making a living doing what I<br/>
love, dressing in comfy clothes (probably sometimes PJs) to do it, being<br/>
adored by thousands of people who think that letterboxing is sending<br/>
LTCs and carrying around Beanie Babies, perhaps getting tax writeoffs<br/>
for attending gatherings in every interesting part of the United States.<br/>
<br/>
What a life!<br/>

&gt; customer base.  Money does talk, and it is his site and he does an<br/>
&gt; excellent job creating it.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, the reason is far more pragmatic than that. =) I added support for those other types of activities before there ever was a premium membership option. Not because I particularly liked them, but rather because until I did, people started listing every friggin' thing as a mystery letterbox. "It's a hitchhiker--I'll just list it as a mystery box." "It's a virtual--I'll just list it as a mystery box."<br/>
<br/>
Not only did it clutter up the mystery searches with boxes that weren't even real boxes, but it forced them down everyone's throat whether they wanted it or not. By segregating them out, it's easier to ignore them (which was my primarily motivation).<br/>
<br/>
However, unlike many folks, I don't have anything against people who want to participate in such activities. I don't understand it myself, but I don't really care if others want to play that game. Just so long as it doesn't get mixed up with the stuff I *do* want to do.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't a problem limited to just Atlas Quest, either. That was the reason Choi added the "traveller" option to LbNA. People had this insistent urge to list stuff as mystery boxes that really weren't mystery boxes, and eventually it's just easier to segregate them out. I don't think the "traveller" option gets used a whole lot anymore, but I suspect that's largely because AQ has taken the pressure off of LbNA to support that option.<br/>
<br/>
I know that a lot of people have an "AQ is the devil" kind of attitude, but there are market forces at work when I decide what to support or not on AQ. If enough people want something, it gets increasingly hard to say no. They'll use and abuse features in ways that were never intended, causing other problems. I'm currently looking to offload virtuals from Atlas Quest completely because they've grown problematic with the sheer numbers people can list and find in such a short period of time. (A decision which has cost me at least one premium member and certainly a lot of grief by many others.)<br/>
<br/>
It's easy to say you don't like a site and point out all the flaws and why your favored site is better. That's fine, but it's very much a glass is half empty kind of attitude to have. For those who use and prefer LbNA, aren't you *glad* that AQ is hosting almost all of the "non letterboxes" rather than LbNA? Without AQ, there would be a heck of a lot more people posting hitchhikers, virtuals, personal travelers, and so forth on LbNA. There would be far more talk about those on the Yahoo Groups than there currently is. The fact that AQ lives helps LbNA stay closer to its roots.<br/>
<br/>
Had I put my programming efforts into LbNA instead, it would probably look a more like AQ does today. I've always hated how the Yahoo Groups worked, and I would have been pushing to take it "in house." (If you searched these archives, you could probably find posts by me even suggesting as much.) <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Why has the the general population just excepted that one person<br/>
&gt; making a profit off of our game been allowed to decide the future<br/>
&gt; of what letterboxing is and will become?<br/>
<br/>
I like this question. =) I'm not sure that the future of letterboxing is entirely in my hands, however. I probably have more influence than most, but I hardly have a monopoly or absolute control of the hobby either. <br/>
<br/>
For years, when LbNA was the only game in town, there was very much an attitude "do it our way, or get lost." LbNA had a monopoly on letterboxing like geocaching.com did on geocaching. For those who agreed with the LbNA philosophy that nothing should ever change and everyone else can just jump in a lake--it was a great place to be. For those that didn't--I gave them an alternative. Just be glad AQ isn't the only game in town--at least you get to choose not to play. In the early days of LbNA, that choice wasn't there.<br/>
<br/>
As for making a profit off of letterboxing, guilty as charged. A couple of points to keep in mind, however.<br/>
<br/>
1. I don't see any of you working for free either. LbNA is run by volunteers. Part time. Atlas Quest is my job.<br/>
<br/>
2. Keep in mind, I could easily double my yearly salary by shutting AQ down and going to work at a corporation. I earned more working at Intel ten years ago than I do running Atlas Quest today. It's not about the money for me. I develop Atlas Quest because I enjoy it. The fact I can earn a living from it is a nice bonus.<br/>
<br/>
3. Premium memberships are optional. Everything anyone needs to actually letterbox is freely available, as it should be.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not expecting anyone who hated AQ to suddenly have a change of heart, but whether you love it or hate it, at least you have options to use it or not. That's not a bad thing.<br/>

I definitely prefer LbNA and do get frustrated with folks who post things<br/>
like personal travelers as letterboxes.  OK, granted, they do sort of come<br/>
with a clue..........in that often a person has to solve some sort of riddle<br/>
or answer some sort of question..........but it's still something *mobile*<br/>
and doesn't belong listed with the regular letterboxes.  And that's what<br/>
folks were beginning to do on LbNA -- list everything in capitivity as a<br/>
letterbox.  And I'm not even interested in them in the first place, so I'm<br/>
always swearing under my breath at these things. I don't like indoor<br/>
letterboxes either where a finder just goes and gives a password and<br/>
receives the box.  I'm incredibly focused on just what *I* like and I want<br/>
it how *I* like it.  I doubt I'll ever change.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
To Caveman, on the other hand, it's *all* better than a hot fudge sundae.<br/>
He *loves* atlasquest.  He loves the bells and whistles, he gets bored with<br/>
"only" following clues and finding letterboxes.  He ooooohs and<br/>
aaaaaahhhhhhs over each little hitchhiker.  He would do postal letterboxes<br/>
if I'd do it with him.  He'd do gatherings if I'd do them with him.<br/>
<br/>
That's his big problem.  He wants us to do things together.  I'm just not<br/>
interested in all those other things.  So I kinda regret the day when<br/>
Caveman discovered what-it-is-that-we-do-out-there-in-the-woods.  But he can<br/>
go on the computer and have atlasquest to amuse him whenever he needs a<br/>
"fix".<br/>
<br/>
He even bought us a premium membership.  Oh yahoo whipeeeeeee!  But it keeps<br/>
him out of my hair, and *that* I'm all for.<br/>
<br/>
We have a vacation coming up the third week in August, so now he's going to<br/>
try to use some sort of mapping thingee that's on atlasquest that finds<br/>
boxes along a travel route.  I say just give me the maps and I'll figure it<br/>
out for myself, in a way that's part of the clues to me.  But noooooo, we'll<br/>
be doing it the yahoo whipeeeeeee! way I guess.  I can live with that.<br/>
Sometimes living with it is good for the marriage.<br/>

option. Not because I particularly liked them, but rather because until I<br/>
did, people started listing every friggin' thing as a mystery letterbox.<br/>
"It's a hitchhiker--I'll just list it as a mystery box." "It's a<br/>
virtual--I'll just list it as a mystery box."<br/>
<br/>
Not only did it clutter up the mystery searches with boxes that weren't even<br/>
real boxes, but it forced them down everyone's throat whether they wanted it<br/>
or not. By segregating them out, it's easier to ignore them (which was my<br/>
primarily motivation).<br/>
<br/>
However, unlike many folks, I don't have anything against people who want to<br/>
participate in such activities. I don't understand it myself, but I don't<br/>
really care if others want to play that game. Just so long as it doesn't get<br/>
mixed up with the stuff I *do* want to do.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't a problem limited to just Atlas Quest, either. That was the reason<br/>
Choi added the "traveller" option to LbNA. People had this insistent urge to<br/>
list stuff as mystery boxes that really weren't mystery boxes, and<br/>
eventually it's just easier to segregate them out. I don't think the<br/>
"traveller" option gets used a whole lot anymore, but I suspect that's<br/>
largely because AQ has taken the pressure off of LbNA to support that<br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>
I know that a lot of people have an "AQ is the devil" kind of attitude, but<br/>
there are market forces at work when I decide what to support or not on AQ.<br/>
If enough people want something, it gets increasingly hard to say no.<br/>
They'll use and abuse features in ways that were never intended, causing<br/>
other problems. I'm currently looking to offload virtuals from Atlas Quest<br/>
completely because they've grown problematic with the sheer numbers people<br/>
can list and find in such a short period of time. (A decision which has cost<br/>
me at least one premium member and certainly a lot of grief by many others.)<br/>
<br/>
It's easy to say you don't like a site and point out all the flaws and why<br/>
your favored site is better. That's fine, but it's very much a glass is half<br/>
empty kind of attitude to have. For those who use and prefer LbNA, aren't<br/>
you *glad* that AQ is hosting almost all of the "non letterboxes" rather<br/>
than LbNA? Without AQ, there would be a heck of a lot more people posting<br/>
hitchhikers, virtuals, personal travelers, and so forth on LbNA. There would<br/>
be far more talk about those on the Yahoo Groups than there currently is.<br/>
The fact that AQ lives helps LbNA stay closer to its roots.<br/>
<br/>
Had I put my programming efforts into LbNA instead, it would probably look a<br/>
more like AQ does today. I've always hated how the Yahoo Groups worked, and<br/>
I would have been pushing to take it "in house." (If you searched these<br/>
archives, you could probably find posts by me even suggesting as much.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Why has the the general population just excepted that one person<br/>
&gt; making a profit off of our game been allowed to decide the future<br/>
&gt; of what letterboxing is and will become?<br/>
<br/>
I like this question. =) I'm not sure that the future of letterboxing is<br/>
entirely in my hands, however. I probably have more influence than most, but<br/>
I hardly have a monopoly or absolute control of the hobby either.<br/>
<br/>
For years, when LbNA was the only game in town, there was very much an<br/>
attitude "do it our way, or get lost." LbNA had a monopoly on letterboxing<br/>
like geocaching.com did on geocaching. For those who agreed with the LbNA<br/>
philosophy that nothing should ever change and everyone else can just jump<br/>
in a lake--it was a great place to be. For those that didn't--I gave them an<br/>
alternative. Just be glad AQ isn't the only game in town--at least you get<br/>
to choose not to play. In the early days of LbNA, that choice wasn't there.<br/>
<br/>
As for making a profit off of letterboxing, guilty as charged. A couple of<br/>
points to keep in mind, however.<br/>
<br/>
1. I don't see any of you working for free either. LbNA is run by<br/>
volunteers. Part time. Atlas Quest is my job.<br/>
<br/>
2. Keep in mind, I could easily double my yearly salary by shutting AQ down<br/>
and going to work at a corporation. I earned more working at Intel ten years<br/>
ago than I do running Atlas Quest today. It's not about the money for me. I<br/>
develop Atlas Quest because I enjoy it. The fact I can earn a living from it<br/>
is a nice bonus.<br/>
<br/>
3. Premium memberships are optional. Everything anyone needs to actually<br/>
letterbox is freely available, as it should be.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not expecting anyone who hated AQ to suddenly have a change of heart,<br/>
but whether you love it or hate it, at least you have options to use it or<br/>
not. That's not a bad thing.<br/>

 &gt; Sorry if I misunderstood.<br/>
<br/>
It was more just a good-natured poke at Ryan in response to his comments<br/>
about those who disparage AQ, given the history of opposition to<br/>
Letterboxing World.  Not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; To follow up on my post in case I didn't misunderstand, I think the <br/>
 &gt; self promotion in each and every post Steve made was and is quite <br/>
different<br/>
&gt; then those that Ryan makes, but I guess that is perception of the reader.<br/>
<br/>
I don't disagree with that, tho likely we will disagree on why it<br/>
matters.  As Ryan said, AQ is his business, and no one works for<br/>
free (I certainly don't, that's for sure, tho if I could afford to,<br/>
I would (that was one of my problems with being a webmaster at LbNA;<br/>
I simply wasn't wealthy enough to give away time and out-of-pocket<br/>
expenses to the cause, especially when I came to believe in the cause<br/>
less and less over time)).  Likewise, no business I'm aware of<br/>
refrains from advertising its goods or services, and both Letterboxing<br/>
World and AQ have done so, just in different ways.<br/>
<br/>
I guess those who are annoyed with a web site's advertising can boycott<br/>
it, and again let market forces decide.  I know when I was younger, I<br/>
was annoyed with the advertising practices of a local gas refiner/<br/>
retailer, and refused to buy gas there.  They are still in business,<br/>
despite my noble boycott, while, last I checked, Letterboxing World<br/>
was defunct.  Perhaps annoyance with the advertising did have a<br/>
market-based effect, tho I tend to believe the reasons for its demise<br/>
were wholly unrelated.<br/>
<br/>
But the real point is that things were different then.  In those days,<br/>
commercialism of the hobby in and of itself was disparaged, now it is<br/>
accepted and supported.  Therefore, advertising by one of these<br/>
businesses will likely be more accepted than it was then, and probably<br/>
seem less annoying (yes, a different semiotic frame of reference in<br/>
interpreting the same thing).  If you go back even further, you should<br/>
see what Dr. Mings was subject to.<br/>
<br/>
There will always be those who are annoyed with commercialism; those<br/>
who are should build what the market demands in a commercial-free<br/>
manner, if they want to, or otherwise accept it.  AQ should not be<br/>
disparaged for LbNA's (or anyone else's) failure to do that, tho<br/>
when I was a webmaster I personally argued for either a purely<br/>
traditional model (and leave geocaching-lite to someone else), or<br/>
a geocaching-lite model, (commercial or donation-based to support<br/>
the expense), given that it was pretty obvious that someone was<br/>
going to do it no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, I feel LbNA ended up in a no-mans land of being neither<br/>
traditional, or what the market really wanted and remaining the voice<br/>
of the hobby, which is fine also, for its operators and its users<br/>
if they are content with that state of affairs.<br/>
<br/>
For my own part, I would have preferred a more mutual enterprise<br/>
and remaining a traditional game, with distributed rather than<br/>
centralized control, and leaving all the rest of that to Grounded,<br/>
Inc.  A not for profit enterprise, but generating enough revenue to<br/>
cover expenses (liability insurance being the most significant,<br/>
followed by server hosting expenses, which, if done right, are well<br/>
above the average schmoe's means), so operators needn't be wealthy<br/>
in order to be operators.  But it was not to be.  And that's fine<br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
JMHO, of course, and just as a disclaimer, I am not intending to<br/>
disparage any web site or its operators.  Its just the way I see<br/>
it, FWIW.<br/>

<br/>
Does AQ change the 'game'? I say yes. At the same time I don't understand what is wrong with change or why people are so against something evolving. No 'game' ever stays the same, it usually improves. I dont think a most of the things on AQ improve the game, but people need to be open to an expanding game. If you dont like it, dont' use it. Personally I would never give a penny to it, and do feel that one person is changing the direction of the hobby in general, but not for me personally...things evolve, thats how it goes<br/>
<br/>
My bigger issue with the Ryan and AQ, is <br/>
~actually checking my email on AQ<br/>
~checking my IP address and confirming/denying to othersif I have othertrailnames<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
that is why i would not give a cent to AQ, and would not encourage others to. <br/>
<br/>
As for Ryan making money doing this..that's the American way. I get the same servive whether I pay or not (well, icant get a pick in the yearly calendar,). Why would I pay for something, that somebody has done on their own? I have personallygotten 9-10 people to not renew their memberships, cause of how I was treated.If Ryan can get people to pay, good for him...more power to him. I think its a great job he has...<br/>
<br/>
it seems people are stuck on the 'history' of the game, and sticking to its roots. Then can somebody explain something to me? I dont letterbox much anymore because of what I feel is a lack of effort by planters to plant letterboxes of quality...like to ones I believe started the hobby. Recently, I found a letterbox by a planter with 5+ years experience, and was hoping they would make effort. Upon finding the box, I wanted to vomit in it. It was the WORST stamp effort I have ever seen...seriously, like 4-5 speedball strokes and there you have it, a stamp for the woods. I don't think that was what the hobby is supposed to be, or what we are supposed to do with it, but it is done all the time. <br/>
<br/>
Change isnt always good, but it is a fact of life<br/>
