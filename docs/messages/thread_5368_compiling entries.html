I just joined the listserv, and was wondering if there was any way for <br/>
the manager to compile the days' entries into one e-mail per day. I'd <br/>
like to learn more about letterboxing but I'm tempted to unsubscribe <br/>
considering the volume of e-mails in my box this morning.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
