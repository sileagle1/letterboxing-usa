January I had the Honor of being the Very First to sign in to the<br/>
Pelican Man letterbox. The box was placed about waist high in the<br/>
branches of the designated palm tree. I returned in March, &amp; found<br/>
there had been a Major trimming to that palm tree, &amp; it now looked<br/>
like a plucked chicken! I hoped that the grounds crew had found the<br/>
box and returned it to it's owner, or maybe given it to the Sanctuary<br/>
folks. What a shame as these stamps were AWESOME!!! Hope this helps<br/>
solve the mystery as to the box going missing. Lobsta in CT<br/>
