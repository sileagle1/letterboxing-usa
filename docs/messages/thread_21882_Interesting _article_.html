I've heard there's an amendment to the bill which would place a "sin<br/>
tax" on letterboxing and geocaching in addition to restricting the<br/>
activities. It's being called the "Prevention of Invaders at Grampa's<br/>
Grave" amendment.<br/>
<br/>
Since LB and GC are subversive, secret groups, the plan is to apply<br/>
the "PIGG" tax to stamping supplies and GPS devices.  The amendment is<br/>
in committee debate right now, but is expect to pass.  The "PIGG" tax<br/>
is expected to increase the cost of stamping supplies by 87 - 106%.<br/>
<br/>
Since the tax is so arbitrary, the Scrapbooking Community and Greeting<br/>
Card Hobbyists--fearing the tax's impact on their activities--are now<br/>
working aggressively against the tax amendment.  They've formed a<br/>
political action committee to lobby the SC legislature against the<br/>
tax.  The PAC is called "Hobbyists for the American Way and<br/>
Godliness", "HAWG" for short.<br/>
