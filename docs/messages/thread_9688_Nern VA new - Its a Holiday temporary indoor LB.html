This box is so tempting!  But, I can't think of anything scarier (even <br/>
Claude Moore Park way in the back at sunset) than the mall right before <br/>
Christmas!!  EEEYIKES!<br/>

&gt;VA Webmaster:  No need to post this letterbox as it is probably<br/>
&gt;temporary for the holidays.  My Webmaster, Knights of Columbo, will<br/>
&gt;post in on my website (please) and those snowed in frustrated local<br/>
&gt;letterboxers will no doubt find it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It's a Holiday<br/>
&gt;Placed by Scarab of the Doubtful Guests<br/>
&gt;December 13, 2002<br/>
&gt;Arlington County<br/>
&gt;Arlington, Virginia<br/>
&gt;Hand made stamp<br/>
&gt;Easy, indoors &amp; probably temporary<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Twas the nightmare before Christmas<br/>
&gt;And all through the mall<br/>
&gt;Anxious shoppers were rushing<br/>
&gt;Praying Pentagon City had it all.<br/>
&gt;I arrived by the Metro<br/>
&gt;And went straight to the top<br/>
&gt;To consult with the Wizard<br/>
&gt;And visit his shop.<br/>
&gt;Puzzling place.  Puzzling Wizard.<br/>
&gt;"Which it's the number of brown tiles between our doorway you wants."<br/>
&gt;"For what, want for what?"<br/>
&gt;"Only Santy Claws and that Scarab fellow know and neither one of<br/>
&gt;them is telling me.<br/>
&gt;Go ask that Joseph at the bank around the corner.<br/>
&gt;That's the place to look if he deposited somethin' int it?"<br/>
&gt;Joseph, I discovered, was full of hang ups.<br/>
&gt;"I haven't a clue," he answered to my enquiries,<br/>
&gt;"but you remind me of that puzzling fellow I saw the other day.<br/>
&gt;He walked away from our window around the curve of the balcony<br/>
&gt;counting the small potted trees.<br/>
&gt;Did it several times like he was trying to be sure of something.<br/>
&gt;I don't know how long those trees have been there myself,<br/>
&gt;Nor how long they'll stay."<br/>
&gt;One, two, three ...  Finally I sat in a long white bench with a fine<br/>
&gt;view.<br/>
&gt;Behind me immediately over my right shoulder was a mall map.<br/>
&gt;Across the wide atrium from me the glass elevator rose and fell.<br/>
&gt;Almost directly below me I gazed down the tree at Santa on his<br/>
&gt;golden chair.<br/>
&gt;"Wow, a natural Santa."<br/>
&gt;"What's an unnatural Santa, Dad?"<br/>
&gt;I pushed the bench towards that potted tree on my right,<br/>
&gt;Made like I was looking at something in my hands,<br/>
&gt;And surreptitiously reached under the faux grey moss.<br/>
&gt;"May I help you?" asked the guard suspiciously.<br/>
&gt;"OH, um, I thought I lost my keys" I said while holding the black,<br/>
&gt;dual film cannisters in one hand,<br/>
&gt;"Wait, here they are in my other pocket."<br/>
&gt;"Alright then, happy holidays to you."<br/>
&gt;"And to you."  Whew.<br/>
&gt;I spent a pleasant time recording in the scroll and enjoying the<br/>
&gt;expansive view.<br/>
&gt;Then I went all the way around and all the way down to celebrate in<br/>
&gt;the food court.<br/>
&gt;Merry letterboxing to all, and to all a good hike.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please be discreet.  Please do not root around in a lot of tree's<br/>
&gt;moss if you're not sure.  It is very likely I will remove this dual<br/>
&gt;black film cannister letterbox after the holidays.  I will note so<br/>
&gt;here before I do.  If you find this letterbox missing or damaged or<br/>
&gt;are puzzled about the clues write theDoubtfulGuests@yahoo.com.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Frostpup and I (dragging along my partner - the Tomato Fairy) ventured<br/>
into the wilds of the Pentagon City Mall for the "It's A Holiday"<br/>
stamp on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to meet there, retrieve the stamp and have lunch.  We found<br/>
the landmarks quite easily and went straight to the spot and found to<br/>
our dismay that someone was sitting on the bench.<br/>
<br/>
Quietly huddled behind him where he couldn't see us, we stared daggers<br/>
at him to no avail.  Should we distract him?  Hit him over the head?<br/>
Push him over the rail?  We thought about sending the Tomato Fairy<br/>
down a few benches to start making a scene and screaming incoherently<br/>
in hopes that it would draw the man from our particular bench. <br/>
(Everyone loves mall drama.)<br/>
<br/>
Instead, we went to a restaurant for lunch and maneuvered a table<br/>
where we could spy on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
During the entire lunch we gazed through the window, distracted from<br/>
our meal, and hungry for the kill.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the benches in all the malls in all the world, he had to park<br/>
on that one.  Finally, he up and left, we were ecstatic.  "HE'S<br/>
GOING!" We exclaimed, turning the heads of nearby munchers.  Noticing<br/>
the attention we were drawing, we quickly applied our exclamation to<br/>
the sports game on the television.  "WHAT A GREAT PLAY!"  <br/>
<br/>
The Tomato Fairy offered to watch our meals so we could swoop in, but<br/>
we decided to finish eating first.<br/>
<br/>
THEN SOMEONE ELSE SAT DOWN WITH A BOOK! Ack!  What is this?  Is our<br/>
letterboxing karma so bad because we haven't placed a box yet?  Could<br/>
this be our punishment?<br/>
<br/>
She eventually left and, instead of lingering over iced tea and polite<br/>
conversation, we threw money at the waitress and quickly circled our prey.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the story was simply and uneventfully retrieve, stamp,<br/>
stamp, replace.<br/>
<br/>
Loved it! Thanks!<br/>

experience with another Doubtful Guest box - the one by the Titanic <br/>
Statue in DC. There was a wino sitting on the bench right near <br/>
the hidden treasure!  I couldn't dig around in the bushes with him <br/>
sitting right there.  I had to sit two benches away, pretending to <br/>
watch the river, and constantly looking at my watch so that I wouldn't <br/>
overextend my lunch hour, while waiting for him to leave or pass out.  <br/>
He finally finished the contents of his brown paper bag and then got <br/>
on his bicycle and pedaled away. A wino with a bicycle! Is this a <br/>
great country, or what?    <br/>

So if anyone wants to start a Patience of Job letterbox, send it my <br/>
way.<br/>
