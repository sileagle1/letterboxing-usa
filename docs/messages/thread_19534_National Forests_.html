National Forests are managed by the USDA Forest Service under the <br/>
Department of Agriculture. National Parks are managed by the Department of <br/>
the Interior. While the NPS does not allow geocaching or letterboxing, the <br/>
USDA Forest Service does allow geocaching (and letterboxing, I'd assume by <br/>
extension), though specific policies can be set by each individual Forest.<br/>
<br/>
Go to:<br/>
http://www.fs.fed.us/<br/>
and search for geocaching and the forest that you're interested in and you <br/>
should turn up pages that describe the policies in place (if any) for a <br/>
particular forest. In some cases, they prohibit the activity in certain <br/>
areas, for instance. (I notice that the Mt Hood page doesn't have any <br/>
geoaching policy listed; I'd assume that no overriding policy governs that <br/>
forest and thus that there are no restrictions on geocaching/letterboxing <br/>
there.)<br/>
<br/>
You can also contact the Forest Service in a particular forest and ask them <br/>
about their geocaching policy without them looking at you strangely or <br/>
kicking you out of the place!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's a couple schools of thought regarding these areas of planting:<br/>
<br/>
1) Better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.<br/>
<br/>
2) It is only prohibited if they know about it (or can find it to <br/>
prohibit it.)<br/>
<br/>
3) Ask and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
We're not saying to run out and plant boxes in national anythings, <br/>
however it HAS been done in the past. Discretion, care, and [well] <br/>
downright secrecy are the keys to it. This applies to all groups <br/>
deemed "sensitive to letterboxing" and I know there's a few of them <br/>
in southern new england that fit in that category.  IMO if you cannot <br/>
google a clue and find "XYZ National Park" in the clues, I would <br/>
guess it is a safer bet  that being blatant about it. <br/>
<br/>
I doubt given the staffing levels in government [generally] that <br/>
there's someone in each national park / forest who routinely patrols <br/>
the internet for clues to that park. <br/>
