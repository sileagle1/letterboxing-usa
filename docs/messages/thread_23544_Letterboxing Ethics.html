Letterboxing in England<br/>
Code of Conduct<br/>
Courtesy of The Yorkshire Tortoise<br/>
<br/>
This Code of Conduct is sent out with all cluelists from the UK letterboxing<br/>
clubs.<br/>
<br/>
1. Digging holes in the ground is illegal, and absolutely FORBIDDEN. No box<br/>
should be placed in a hole in the ground, and the soil surface should not be<br/>
disturbed when looking for a box.<br/>
2. No box should be placed in any animals earth, set or warren, even if it<br/>
appears to be disused. (Offenders may be prosecuted)<br/>
3. If a box is placed in a hole in a dead tree, make sure that it is not<br/>
likely to cause harm to rare lichen, moss, insects etc<br/>
4. Avoid putting a box on heathland where it may disturb a ground nesting<br/>
bird<br/>
5. All boxes must have a contact address or telephone number<br/>
6. Do not place a box in any monument or stone wall, nor any site of<br/>
historic or archaeological importance<br/>
7. Avoid public resort areas<br/>
8. Boxes should be as sturdy as possible and an unobtrusive colour, but NOT<br/>
wrapped in plastic bags or sheeting ? Animals eat it!<br/>
9. The grouse-shooting season starts on August 12th, and continues until<br/>
December. If there is any sign of a shoot, or land management in progress,<br/>
please letterbox in a different area in order to avoid attention being drawn<br/>
to our activities<br/>
10. Respect other people?s property and privacy<br/>
11. Do not leave litter (aim to leave a site tidier than you found it)<br/>
12. Try not to disturb vegetation or wildlife when planting or looking for<br/>
boxes<br/>
13. Be aware of the security issues of leaving boxes following recent<br/>
bombings<br/>
14. Follow the country code (The country or "countryside code" is and<br/>
established set of four guidelines: Be safe, leave gates and property as you<br/>
found them, protect wildlife, control dogs and consider other people. )<br/>

Thanks for sharing this.  I think the whole document has some good <br/>
points.<br/>
<br/>
Putting letterboxes inside plastic bags is a big no-no here in the <br/>
Pacific Northwest.  We have many areas with lots of moisture and <br/>
putting the box in a bag usually ensures the entire box is damp or <br/>
worse.<br/>
<br/>
I especially like the country code and would hope that the majority <br/>
of letterboxes would follow this.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to ask:  How many letterboxers carry garbage bags and <br/>
pick up litter when they LB?<br/>
<br/>
If not, can I challenge you to start this?  Having a positive impact <br/>
on the environment would be an excellent tenant of Letterboxing.<br/>

An excellent idea, and one which geocaching has supported for a quite<br/>
a while; it's called CITO: Cache In, Trash Out.  Might we propose an<br/>
analog for LB?  LITO: Letterbox in, Trash Out.  All it takes is a<br/>
plastic trashbag, and maybe a pair of gloves, or one of those<br/>
trash-grabber goodies.  Groups can even plan events for cleaning up an<br/>
area, and hide a box or two as part of the deal.  If you can work out<br/>
a quid-pro-quo with a local Park Department, even better, as then<br/>
you'll have permission for the LBs, and official acknowledgement from<br/>
them of your activities, which will go far towards fending off any<br/>
negative comments.  This approach has worked very well with COSCA and<br/>
other agencies in the Conejo Valley (Thousand Oaks area) of Southern<br/>
California.  We rarely lose a cache to groundskeepers and such.<br/>

carries trash bags with them (I know my family does), but this idea helps to<br/>

a bag for someone who came along ill-equipped.<br/>

Guess you could do the same by leaving a small supply of trash bags in a<br/>

Hey, Clyde! I've always loved that British book of "rules," and I <br/>
think they are probably perfect for Dartmoor. For the entire US, <br/>
though, I'm not sure they fit and we have adopted a more general <br/>
approach. The Mapsurfer's faq on LbNA at<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html#015<br/>
<br/>
is what I suggest you go by. Using the Leave No Trace philosophy <br/>
might sound a little counterintuitive since by its very nature <br/>
letterboxing leaves more than a trace, but the underlying philosophy <br/>
works. <br/>
<br/>
As for digging holes, lots of American letterboxes are plugged in the <br/>
ground. I think they don't dig in Dartmoor because they're likely to <br/>
disturb an ancient artifact or dig up some unexploded ordinance.<br/>
<br/>
Hiding in stone walls is a touchy subject here in New England, where <br/>
these old fences are ubiquitous. There have been some disasters with <br/>
stone wall damage caused by letterboxers, unfortunately. We still do <br/>
it ourselves but have mixed emotions about it, and try to describe <br/>
exactly where to look in walls so that finders don't have to tear <br/>
through them searching. There is one preserve manager in our area who <br/>
is particularly against stone wall hides, and I recommend anyone in <br/>
CT planting in Avalonia Trust properties avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that putting the Dartmoor rules in your boxes would be <br/>
much help, but adding a Leave No Trace pamphlet might be an idea. You <br/>
can download them in pdf from their website.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we enjoyed reading your blogged Rehide post where you found <br/>
one of your own letterboxes mistakenly rehidden in plain site in a  <br/>
garden pagoda. Priceless!<br/>

Using the Leave No Trace philosophy<br/>
might sound a little counterintuitive since by its very nature<br/>
letterboxing leaves more than a trace, but the underlying philosophy<br/>
works.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Jay,<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty committed to LNT myself.  I teach it to scouts, so I want to<br/>
always practice it so that I don't have to think about whether I am abiding<br/>
by it or not when I know I'm in a position to set an example.<br/>
<br/>
I struggled with letterboxing for quite some time because, as you said, it<br/>
is counterintuitive to the philosophy of LNT.  I finally found my way clear<br/>
to continue LB'ing when I realized that I am observing LNT with respect to<br/>
durable surfaces and planning ahead and leaving what I find and being<br/>
respectful of others.  I am also heightening awareness of the outdoor world<br/>
through many of my boxes, which in turn encourages others to learn and<br/>
practice LNT.  And although not all LB'ers are LNT'ers, many if not most<br/>
letterboxers will gladly pick up trash to and from a box, which certainly<br/>
enhances LNT.  Finally, in leaving behind tupperware, it is true that we are<br/>
leaving behind superfluous material, but as long as we maintain our boxes<br/>
and plant with the other principles in mind (particularly durable surfaces),<br/>
I believe letterboxing is harmonious to LNT.  And frankly, if I couldn't say<br/>
that and believe it, I don't think I could continue letterboxing.<br/>

I have found a box or two by a particular placer that were in dug <br/>

the winter when they've frozen into the ground is impossible, <br/>
secondly it just doesn't "feel" right.<br/>
