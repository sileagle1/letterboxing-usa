You are doing an exchange with someone and having a wonderful <br/>
time......<br/>
While stamping in, you get a feeling, turn and look behind you......<br/>
No one is there......<br/>
You continue to stamp in but get that feeling again........<br/>
Again no one is there.......<br/>
You decide that you need to head outside in search of <br/>
letterboxes.......<br/>
You reach into your pockets and find.........<br/>
A COOTIE!<br/>
<br/>
Are you ready for the Cootie Crew?<br/>
<br/>
Let the games begin!<br/>
<br/>
To become a part of the Cootie Crew experience, join the club.<br/>
When you join the club, you recieve a certificate of membership, an <br/>
official Cootie Crew tee-shirt, and a offical Cootie Crew patch. <br/>
<br/>
Introductory price is $15 for shirt and patch. On any orders placed <br/>
after March 11th, the price will be $18, tee-shirts $15 and patches <br/>
$3 each. Shipping is $5. Remeber, it is cheaper to join at gatherings <br/>
I am attending.<br/>
<br/>
All money made off the sales of the Cootie Crew will be placed back <br/>
into Letterboxing, with some of the money made, going to a charity <br/>
choosen by the Cootie Crew members at the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I am only doing children shirts. S, M, L, XL.<br/>
Colors available : White, Black, Ash, Pale Pink, Forrest Green, Navy <br/>
Blue.<br/>
I will be working on making available, adult and toddler shirts for <br/>
anyone who is interested.<br/>
<br/>
The offical Cootie Crew Patches will be black and white. When you <br/>
receive your patch, you can color your cootie withany color you wish. <br/>
Recommendations on what ink to use will come as soon as I figure that <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
A webpage will soon be up for the Cootie Crew to read up on events <br/>
coming up and games to play. It will also be easier to order a <br/>
membership there as well.<br/>
<br/>
The orders can officialy start coming in. A bunch of you have already <br/>
emailed me, so if you could do it again with sizes and colors, that <br/>
would be great. ANY ORDERS will start being shipped on March 18th.<br/>
<br/>
