from who knows where. Best to let that clear. So sorry !to Deb Perry <br/>
all the Cock-A-Doodle-Moo letterboxes in Mansfield ,Ct. are mine and <br/>
you can use the clues as well as Paw Print by the Cowboy ( my son). <br/>
He would be thrilled it is his first and he is hoping it gets a <br/>
visitor. <br/>
   The get together I will work on this week . As I sat through a <br/>
long swim meet yesterday I was thinking up all kinds of ideas. We <br/>
have another meet today, I will try to pin down more detail in my <br/>
head and get back to all.<br/>
   Miss Kathryn, thank you for asking questions keep it up. Ask all <br/>
you want it has really motivated some of us.  So your Cheshire box <br/>
will have friends I plan to mail a packet of material on letterboxing <br/>
to my cousins in Cheshire they do boy scouts. <br/>
  Early yesterday I walked out to check Wolf Rock Letterbox<br/>
(Mansfield) there were 41 stamps in it since its creation in Sept. It <br/>
was a first for many . We were there just after sunrise, we heard <br/>
turkeys gobbling and saw a beautiful red tail hawk. No better way to <br/>
start a day!<br/>
