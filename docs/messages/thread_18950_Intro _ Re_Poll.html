                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello, everyone!  My name is Kaycee and I may be the newest newbie, as I<br/>
just joined late last night.  I live in western NY and am a homeschooling<br/>
mom with 2 kids, 10 yo ds and 7 yo dd.  I read about letterboxing in a<br/>
homeschool magazine and thought it sounded like a great summer project.  So<br/>
far, we've found 3 boxes.  Our first one was a hitchhiker, and I had no idea<br/>
what it was.  I thought I had misunderstood and we were supposed to move all<br/>
these boxes around or something...then my 7 yo pipes up that there was<br/>
something else in the hole and we found the box we were looking for (I get<br/>
it now...).  Our second trip, we took friends with us, and they are hooked<br/>
too.  I have at least 4 more families that want to try this out with us!  My<br/>
goal is to plant at least 2 letterboxes by the end of summer.<br/>
<br/>
I spent quite a bit of time last night reading the archives and I hope you<br/>
don't mind if I comment.  I can see why people get tired of answering the<br/>
same questions OVER and OVER.  It happens a lot on homeschool boards where<br/>
people are contemplating major lifestyle changes and can get rather panicky.<br/>
I'm so glad there are veterans willing to do the hand-holding and walk them<br/>
through their questions or point them in the right direction, knowing that<br/>
it won't be long before those newbies become veterans themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I think it a good idea to include a link to the FAQ's page within the intro<br/>
message.  Most people starting something new want to learn to do it right,<br/>
but like me, tend to LEAP before they LOOK.  Maybe it's inconsiderate, but<br/>
some people like the person-to-person thing rather than weeding through a<br/>
long list of FAQs.  Referring them back to the FAQs might encourage them to<br/>
read through it.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to reading your posts!<br/>
<br/>
Shalom,<br/>
Kaycee    <br/>
