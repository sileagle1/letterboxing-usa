The family and I enjoyed a too quick weekend trip down to eastern<br/>
Tennessee this weekend.  We viewed the magnificent foliage and found<br/>
the Gatlinburg letterbox as a bonus.  It was great to get to view so<br/>
many signature stamps from folks around the country that we usually<br/>
don't cross paths with.  Very nice box - dry and in good condition -<br/>
and a very nice stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, we didn't have as good a luck with the Smoky Fir box. <br/>
Despite very good clues and a thorough search, we were unable to find<br/>
any sign of it.  We suspect the rangers may have got it.  Too bad. <br/>
The Park Service needs a more enlightened policy about this.  Hope you<br/>
all had a good weekend!<br/>
