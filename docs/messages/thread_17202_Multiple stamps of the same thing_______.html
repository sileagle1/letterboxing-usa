                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't see a problem with it either, however, since some have expressed a<br/>
concern of finding multiples of 'the same stamp' in the same general area, &amp;<br/>
since the tri-state here has the same bird, do you have more than one<br/>
cardinal design for the Ohio/Ky/Ind tri-state? Or, the Ohio one could be<br/>
placed near Cleveland (if you get a volunteer from up there). I know there<br/>
are letterboxers near Indianapolis, if they volunteered to place the Indiana<br/>
stamp, that would get it out of the general tri-state area too. Just a<br/>
thought.<br/>
I personally think that any handcarved design will be an original, even if<br/>
it's the same image! I'd be happy to be able to get at least three of your<br/>
series (if they are placed in the tri-state area or in the off chance that I<br/>
get to travel :-).<br/>

horns to break up traffic jams"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is there an unspoken rule that only one carving of something can 'exist'<br/>
at once?  In other words, my grandiose plans of planting a stamp in each of<br/>
the 50 states of the Union, and choosing to depict the State Bird of the<br/>
state each box is placed in.....  Does this constitute a transgression?  Can<br/>
only one stamp of something exist at one time?  Should one carving of<br/>
something exist at one time? Does the fact that someone else carves it, make<br/>
it 'different'?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In example, can no one ever carve anything related to the 'Pirates of the<br/>
Caribbean' because Team Rayvenhaus already has?  If someone else has carved<br/>
Pirates Flags before, can no one else ever do it again?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please share you thoughts with me on this, I am interested on knowing.<br/>

unlikely any two would be identical. Because I enjoy the box hunt, I <br/>
wouldn't care if I found two or more similar stamps carved by different <br/>
people. They'd probably end up on different pages in my log anyway. And <br/>
I love to browse through my log, especially now that winter is here.<br/>
