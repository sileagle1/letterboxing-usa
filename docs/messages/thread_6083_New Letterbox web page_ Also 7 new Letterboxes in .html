                    <html><body><p>First things first. Hats off to the Lbna web masters. It took me a month to create my little web page. You guys must have a ton of patience. I've put all my Bike it or Hike it Letterboxes into one web page. I also added a feature where I list the date the box was last verified as intact. I'm still working on adding a comments box so that fellow boxers can let me know if they found a box and its condition. This should let boxers know the last time my box was located before they set out to find it. I also have 7 new Letterboxes from the states of CT, MA, RI, NJ, MD and VA. I sure hope this works. If you have any problems, let me know.                                     Bill &amp; Craig                                                                                                             F200P32X33                                                                                                                                                    Bike It or Hike It Letterboxing Home Page <a href="http://www.geocities.com/haalck@snet.net">www.geocities.com/haalck@snet.net</a> <br/><br/></p></body></html>
