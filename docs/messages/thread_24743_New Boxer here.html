<br/>
found out about letterboxing yesterday. Spent the afternoon researching <br/>
it. Im gonna give it a try as it sounds really fun. I do have 1 <br/>
question that I could not find an answer for so I turn to you [fellow <br/>
boxers] for help. <br/>
<br/>
when you plant a new box for others to find, is the stamp in the newly <br/>
planted box the same as the one you use or is it different?<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance for you help.<br/>

<br/>
Good question, glad I can answer. <br/>
<br/>
The stamp in the letterbox is for the letterbox you are planting. <br/>
<br/>
The stamp you personally use is your "signature" stamp . . . and you <br/>
should have a trail name to go along with your "signature" stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Have you checked out AtlasQuest.com yet. They have a lot of information <br/>
and a lot people there will help you will all of your questions.<br/>
<br/>
I have planted 24 letterboxes and they are all very different. My <br/>
signature stamp is that that of a retro cat, and my trail name is slick <br/>
kitty.<br/>

I didn't plant any of my own boxes until I had 50 finds under my belt.  By<br/>
then I had a pretty good idea of what was expected in a box, what<br/>
constitutes a good hiding spot, and I had some ideas about logbooks and<br/>

How's that for a non-answer?  Have fun!<br/>

Do you guys have a family stamp or individual ones or both?  I'm <br/>
still trying to figure that out. And how to carve, too.  I did a choo-<br/>

We have individual stamps, which I realize is a bit of a faux pas when<br/>
letterboxing as a small group, but having their own stamps is part of what<br/>
keeps my kids excited about letterboxing.   If they're excited, then it's<br/>
much easier for me to get them out of the house.  So, to all of you who have<br/>
