<div><span class="780595022-10112002">I agree!  And I, 
too, met Kebbie and Flower Lady today at Northwest Park.  Fun to meet them 
and to get an exchange on the trail! :)  Ended up finding all of the boxes 
there, and then moved on to find the Keep on Rollin' boxes, then Johnathan's 
Dream in West Hartford, and then Cute Cluckers and Cream of the Crop.  
Whew!  I think that's a personal record for one day's worth of 
boxing!  Lots of fun, and very little rain...weren't we supposed to get 
some today?  Can't scare me with a little rain...I'll be out tomorrow, 
too!</span></div>

<div>The times we have met other LBers on the trail, there is something about 
  their activities that indicates they are LBing.  Such as searchng around 
  stumps and trees, or taking compass bearings, and usually holding papers in 
  theor hands.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Today we met Flower Lady and Kebbie on the trail at Northwest Park.  
  We asked, Are you letter boxing?  Thats all it took.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What a great weekend to be out and about!!!!!</div>

<div> </div><tt>How about a "secret password" that letterboxers can use 
    when they see <br/>others who might be letterboxers on the trail? It would 
    have to be <br/>something that wouldn't make every person with a backpack 
    think we've <br/>lost our minds. Maybe a question to ask, that another 
    letterboxer <br/>would respond to a certain way, but other people would treat 
    as <br/>ordinary conversation. Any ideas?<br/><br/>Curious Crane<br/><br/>--- In

    Jodi,<br/>&gt; My LBNA patch is on the small pack I carry with me. I know 
    this <br/>sounds weird, but if I am out and I see others who I think might be 
    <br/>letterboxes, if I am not comfortable just going up to them and 
    <br/>asking, I shift the pack around so that the patch shows. It's 
    <br/>brightly colored for its small size, so stands out against my black 
    <br/>pack. It is fun to run into others and exchange stamps and friendly 
    <br/>hellos, but caution always comes first.<br/>&gt; I do go out alone at 
    times (always with cell phone and pepper spray <br/>very handy) and I've 
    sadly had to learn to be more wary. If you are <br/>out alone, trust your gut 
    and if it feels wrong, try to remove <br/>yourself from the area as quickly 
    and safely as possible. <br/>&gt; I'm sure others have insights as well.

    want a patch, now <br/>&gt; &gt; would be a good time to order it.  
    <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Remember, it takes 4 to 6 weeks to get the 
    patches<br/>&gt; &gt; once I have made the order <br/>&gt; &gt; so if anyone
