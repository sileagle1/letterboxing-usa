                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've posted this information in other places, but am just getting <br/>
around to putting it here on the main list. By now, I suppose most <br/>
people who were unable to attend the "We Live and Breathe" 10th <br/>
anniversary celebration back in September have at least heard about <br/>
the letterboxing museum that was on display during the event. I <br/>
really must say that it was a very cool exhibit, with contributions <br/>
being sent in from around the country and from Dartmoor.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe the most exciting part of the museum was the impressive <br/>
collection of PATCHES from various stages in letterboxing history. <br/>
This display included many hard-to-find and one-of-a-kind patches, <br/>
including contributions from the Dartmoor 100 Club, Valley Quest, <br/>
World of Letterboxing, and several U.S. and Dartmoor letterboxers. A <br/>
number of obsolete regional and event patches were included, in <br/>
addition to various letterboxing awards and novelties.<br/>
<br/>
Once we fully comprehended just how significant this collection had <br/>
turned out to be, some of us members of the event planning committee <br/>
decided to convert it into a permanent display which will be visiting <br/>
many letterboxing events in the years to come. In fact, we're <br/>
contributing quite a bit of our own money in an ongoing effort to <br/>
preserve this aspect of our hobby's history and share it with others. <br/>
<br/>
We've decided to call this project "The Traveling Repository of <br/>
Letterboxing Patches" and we're also in the process of putting the <br/>
entire collection online. We believe this historical information <br/>
deserves to be made available to as many people as possible.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.weliveandbreathe.com/history.htm<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we don't think it's enough to merely show you the patches. <br/>
We want to create a record of the stories behind them all before they <br/>
are forgotten and lost forever. This is a huge undertaking, and we <br/>
desperately need YOUR HELP!<br/>
<br/>
Please take some time to visit our online exhibit. If you have <br/>
information to go along with any of the patches, please contact me as <br/>
soon as possible. In particular, we want to document the <br/>
circumstances that led to the existence of each patch -- Who designed <br/>
it? How was it inspired? When did it become available?<br/>
<br/>
We also need to know about any patches that are missing from the <br/>
collection. We need you to help us gather this historical information <br/>
so it can be shared with generations of letterboxers to come. Our <br/>
current goal is to have everything organized and ready for exhibition <br/>
at LB CON 2009.<br/>
