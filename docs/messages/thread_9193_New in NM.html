<br/>Santa Barbara Camp Ground Letterbox
<br/>
<br/>(Penasco, New Mexico, in the Carson National Forest)
<br/>
<br/>Placed on September 15, 2002 by J,L &amp; L.
<br/>
<br/>An easy hike, about 45 minutes up.
<br/>
<br/>Get yourself to Penasco, in northern New Mexico, which is about an hour to an
<br/>hour and a half drive from either Santa Fe or Taos. Penasco is on the high road
<br/>between Santa Fe and Taos. In Penasco, you will come to a Y in the road where
<br/>highway 75 and 73 meet up. From that Y, drive south on highway 73 for
<br/>approximately 1.5 miles to the community (no sign) of Rodarte. You will see a
<br/>sign on the right pointing you to the Santa Barbara Camp Ground (it's highway
<br/>116). Turn left. You will drive on pavement for a bit and then end up on a dirt
<br/>road heading into the forest. There is one fork in the road, stay to the left
<br/>(to the right takes you down into the valley). Continue on the road until you
<br/>get to the entrance to Santa Barbara Camp Ground. There may be a day use fee
<br/>(there is definitely an overnight use fee). Santa Barbara has camp and picnic
<br/>sites arranged along a one-way road that makes a loop. Drive to the far end of
<br/>the loop, this is where the trail starts. There is no sign marking the
<br/>trailhead, but there is a turnstile type gate at the beginning of the trail. If
<br/>you can, park nearby, otherwise you may have to go back to the beginning of the
<br/>loop and the large parking area. The September day we were there it was not
<br/>crowded and we parked close to the trail head.
<br/>
<br/>After the turnstile gate, you will walk through small meadows dotted with
<br/>wildflowers and Aspen trees. If you go in the fall, you will have a trail
<br/>covered with yellow and orange Aspen leaves. The trail parallels Rio Santa
<br/>Barbara and you will hear the babbling during most of the walk. After about 35
<br/>minutes of leisurely walking, you will come to sign marking the boundary
<br/>between Carson National Forest and the Pecos Wilderness. Walk another 10
<br/>minutes or so and you will come to a wooden footbridge.
<br/>
<br/>Cross the footbridge and walk about 8 paces. You are very close to the
<br/>letterbox. On the left side of the trail is a large pine tree. Look up the hill
<br/>on your left. At shoulder height are four small blue spruce in a bit of a
<br/>circle; look for the box under a cluster of rocks in that circle. (After you
<br/>cross the footbridge, if you get to the drainage culvert, you have gone too
<br/>far, turn around and walk 6 or 7 paces back.) 
<br/>
<br/>Enjoy your outing!
