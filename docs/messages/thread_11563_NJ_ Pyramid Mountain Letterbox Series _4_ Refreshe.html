Pyramid Mountain Natural Historical Area<br/>
Planted 05/28/01, Refreshed 03/29/03 <br/>
Montville, Morris County, New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
Terrain: Moderately Easy with a steep climb<br/>
Time: Approximately 1 1/2 - 2 hours <br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet, as some areas of this park are heavily traveled.<br/>
<br/>
Established after a lengthy grassroots effort to preserve the area from <br/>
development, the Pyramid Mountain Natural Historic Area is over a thousand <br/>
acres of open space rich in natural and historical resources. <br/>
<br/>
The broad mountains, flat-topped ridges and narrow valleys of Pyramid <br/>
Mountain are not only beautiful but also vital in feeding downstream <br/>
reservoirs, supplying needed aquifers and supporting flora and fauna. The <br/>
wide variety of natural habitats found within Pyramid Mountain include <br/>
fields, forests, streams, swamps, and ponds, which support a number of plants <br/>
considered uncommon to New Jersey as well as threatened and endangered plants <br/>
and animals. Bears, snakes, foxes, and bobcats have all been seen in the <br/>
park. Historically, Pyramid Mountain is important for its lessons about the <br/>
Lenape Indians, who flourished in this area, and the early European settlers, <br/>
who came to the area to take advantage of its rich natural resources. <br/>

<br/>
Diploma Letterbox  (Placed 03/29/03)<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the parking area across from Mars Court. If a map is available take <br/>
one. Take and follow the blue trail. The blue trail forks before a walk over <br/>
bridge, take the fork west over the bridge. If you come to a road, you've <br/>
taken the wrong fork. Follow blue trail until you see the start of the red <br/>
square trail. Take and follow the red square trail. Shortly you'll see the <br/>
start of the unmapped red circle trail on the left of the trail.  Follow this <br/>
trail to the end, there is an overlook and a boulder indicating the end of <br/>
the trail.  From the boulder go 51 paces at 5 degrees.  You will come to a <br/>
rock mound.  On the north face of the mound, near the ground and behind a <br/>
rock is what you're searching for.  This box was planted to commemorate <br/>
Wingfoot graduating from college! <br/>

<br/>
Go back and pick up red square trail.  Continue along red square trail the <br/>
way you didn't come.  When you come to the white trail, go right. You will <br/>
come to a gigantic boulder on the left of the path. This is Bear Rock. It is <br/>
a glacial erratic. Take the blue trail heading north. When you come to the <br/>
intersection of the blue and red/white blaze trails look for a sign on a tree <br/>
pointing you to the "Visitor's center". Take 3 paces northeast from that tree <br/>
with the sign. There will be a downed tree. Follow tree uphill to its stump. <br/>
Under a pile of rocks, at the tree's stump, is what you are searching for.<br/>
<br/>
Whale Head Rock Letterbox  (Placed 05/28/01)<br/>
<br/>
Now take the red/white trail. There is a steep rocky climb along the trail. <br/>
Once you reach the top continue along the trail. On the right you'll see the <br/>
Whale Head Rock, a massive boulder. After passing the boulder continue along <br/>
trail. You'll see a red/white blaze directing you to a left turn. From the <br/>
tree with that blaze you'll be able to see a big split tree behind a rock at <br/>
130 degrees. Take 25 paces to that tree. From tree take 16 paces at 60 <br/>
degrees. There will be a stump with a pile of rocks behind it; within the <br/>
pile of rocks is what you're searching for. <br/>
<br/>
Tripod Rock Letterbox  (Placed 03/29/03)<br/>
<br/>
Now continue along red/white trail going the way you didn't come. You'll <br/>
eventually pass a massive boulder on the right.  Shortly you will come to a <br/>
rock formation on the right of the trail; the trail will then begin to climb. <br/>
 Now it gets a little tricky.  At the top you'll see two four foot tall rocks <br/>
a few feet off the left side of the trail.  If you look back, you'll see a <br/>
blazed tree on the right of the trail.  That tree is unblazed from your <br/>
original approach.  90 degrees and four paces from the tree is the far four <br/>
foot high rock, behind that rock, hidden behind two smaller rocks is what you <br/>
seek.  Hide box after stamping in and continue along trail the way you didn't <br/>
come.  <br/>
<br/>
When you come to the white trail take the south fork. Continue along white <br/>
trail until you come to Tripod Rock. Tripod Rock, perched on a bluff, this <br/>
megalith seems like a freak of nature, its 140-ton boulder resting <br/>
precariously atop three small rock feet. Geologists believe a receding <br/>
glacier created it some 18,000 years ago during the Ice Age. Some super <br/>
naturalists suspect it was an Indian version of Stonehenge, used to pinpoint <br/>
the summer solstice. (Reportedly some devotees gather each June 21 at sunset <br/>
to burn candles and beat drums in tribute.) The planter of these boxes has <br/>
not taken part in these ceremonies. After examining Tripod Rock continue <br/>
along white trail. When you come to the blue trail, take the south fork. <br/>
Eventually you'll come to the blue/white trail on your right. If you want to <br/>
take a quick detour for an overlook take this trail to the end and you'll <br/>
arrive at Lucy's overlook. Enjoy view and when done continue along blue <br/>
trail. Blue trail meets up with yellow trail. Take the merged blue/yellow <br/>
trail. When trail splits, take blue trail once again. Eventually you'll come <br/>
to an overlook on the left of this trail. Enjoy the view. Once back on blue <br/>
trail you'll shortly come to yet another overlook. Continue down hill on blue <br/>
trail back to parking lot. <br/>
