America. Thanks to Esperanza for helping out with the project!<br/>

<br/>
Old Mission Peninsula<br/>
45th Parallel<br/>
Grand Traverse County, Michigan<br/>

<br/>
Take highway 37 north from Traverse City to the tip of the Old Mission Peninsula Lighthouse park.  <br/>
Bring  your camera and be sure to take a picture by the 45th parallel sign in the back of the <br/>
lighthouse!  The trailhead begins to the west of the sign off the parking lot.  The trail will <br/>
immediately fork to the left to the beach.  Stay to the right on the main trail, which will soon come <br/>
to a crossroads, again stay on the main trail (or trail 1,2 on the sign).  The trail will again fork to the <br/>
left to the beach, again stay to the right.  Look for a sawed off stump that is almost vertical on the <br/>
left side of the trail.  As you hike notice the large granite rocks also on the left.  Wait for the striped <br/>
one across from a Y-shaped oak.  This rock points into the forest.  Take a compass bearing on this <br/>
heading at 110 degrees.  Follow this bearing into the woods to a large green rock.  Once there you'll <br/>
notice a fallen log to your right, find the box.  From here past the trees you'll have the beach at the tip <br/>
of the peninsula to yourself.  Beware the roots on the trail and the poison ivy in the sand on the beach.  <br/>
The best beach for swimming at Old Mission is found south of the park.  You can park along the <br/>
roadside and walk down to the beach.  Refreshments can be found at the Old Mission General Store, a <br/>
great stop!  There are also numerous roadside fruit stands and several markets for fruit in season-<br/>
from cherries to peaches to apples, enjoy!<br/>

Cairn Highway<br/>
45th Parallel<br/>
North of Elk Rapids<br/>
Antrim County, Michigan<br/>
Placed August 16, 2002<br/>
Planted by Esperanza (w/ help from Matt the Rat)<br/>
<br/>
The Cairn Highway is a country road that begins in Elk Rapids, and then heads north paralleling <br/>
Highway 31 and then intersects it north of the  Cairn turnout.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from the south take Highway 31 north to Elk  Rapids. At the light after the bridge in Elk <br/>
Rapids take a right. The road will have bends and turns with the lake on the right. Follow it as it <br/>
heads to Elk Lake, it is the Cairn Highway. It will turn left at a corner between a tennis court and a <br/>
tavern.  Take it north until you see the Cairn turnout.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from the north on Highway 31 after Torch Lake you'll see a sign on the highway for the 45th <br/>
parallel.  After that will be a sign for the Cairn Highway, take it left and follow it down to the Cairn <br/>
turnout  (It is a bit easier to find coming from the north).<br/>
<br/>
The Cairn is in the middle of a row of huge old maple trees in the turnout. The box is in the first tree <br/>
south of the Cairn.  It's a huge tree with a large trunk and many big branching limbs that form a <br/>
"pocket" at their base. You'll have to reach up in there and dig past the bark which hides the box. (A <br/>
shorter person my need to bring a bucket or something to stand on,  I'm 5'9" and can reach it okay).  <br/>
Have a lookout for someone coming around the corner, as you reach up you may easily be discovered by <br/>
someone driving by. <br/>
<br/>
Please replace the bark and hide it well.  The Cairn was built in 1938 to honor Hugh J. Gray, a pioneer <br/>
in Michigan tourism.  It is built with a rock from each county in Michigan, very interesting, <br/>
educational, and worth the stop!<br/>
