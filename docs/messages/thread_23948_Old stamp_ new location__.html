Hmmm...yes, that's different. Usually it has been the whole package<br/>
therefore, really a new box entirely. But, in this case where you only<br/>
move the box - it's essentially the same no?<br/>

I'd put something in the text of the clue to notify previous finders<br/>
that this is the same stamp (ie: something they've already found),<br/>
although on second thought, if you just update the clue (with a new<br/>
location) then it doesn't matter for those who have already found the<br/>
box, they'd never know. Therein lies the difficulty of my present<br/>
situation - having replaced both the stamp AND the location therefore<br/>
making an entirely new box and trying to entice previous finders to<br/>
find the same thing again is difficult.<br/>

We had a similar situation. We had planted boxes when we first started <br/>
using store bought stamps. As we advanced in the hobby and learned to <br/>
carve, we've replaced these stamps with hand-carved ones. In some cases, <br/>
we've also relocated the box because of our more, um, *experienced* <br/>
planting skills. What we have done is put either "NEW STAMP" or "NEW <br/>
STAMP AND LOCATION" in the box title, and updated the clues to encourage <br/>
people to visit even if they had already found the original box/stamp. <br/>
It seems to have worked - we've had return visitors to all the boxes <br/>
we've updated in this way.<br/>

PS: In one case, we retired the old box and posted as a new box, because <br/>
we felt we'd changed the stamp/theme of the box so much that it was <br/>
truly a new plant. This one has also had visits from folks who found the <br/>
original box.<br/>

That is what I was thinking I would do. Just change the clues, but keep <br/>
the same name, LBNA ID, etc. I was also going to say that the box had <br/>
been in a different location. That way, as you said, people would know <br/>
they had already gotten the stamp.<br/>
