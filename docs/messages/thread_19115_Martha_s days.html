<br/>
And, Moderators, this is what I'm talking about when I speak of the <br/>
discussion getting "nasty". I do letterboxing to get away from <br/>
cynicism and political discussions. Surely, surely, the conservatives <br/>
don't think they own Letterboxing? Do you want everyone to feel <br/>
welcome here who's interested in the hobby, or is there a whole <br/>
additional set of criteria for "membership". <br/>
<br/>
If this laugh was directed at me, I deserve an apology.<br/>
<br/>
If this group is about letterboxing, then the political folk need to <br/>
be told to cool it, or take their anti-Martha fest offline.<br/>
<br/>
Does cruelty rule everywhere? I've been lurking here less than a <br/>
week, and I'm already seeing political hate messages?<br/>

<br/>
You appear to be coming in in the middle of a long line of Martha <br/>
posts. The martha thread on this list vastly predates any of <br/>
the "villification" that you speak of in your follow up to the post <br/>
to which I am replying. <br/>
<br/>
You see, there are a number of Martha letterboxes floating around in <br/>
the world. As some of them travel around from letterboxer to <br/>
letterboxer, silly stories are posted to the list about how Martha <br/>
found the recipient's house in disarray, and spent the afternoon <br/>
giving the place a thorough scrubbing, making some homemade whale <br/>
blubber lanterns to soften the harsh lighting, planting annuals in <br/>
the front yard which when viewed from overhead appear to be a <br/>
portrait of Martha Washington and so forth...<br/>
<br/>
The point that I am making here is that this thread is NOT off topic, <br/>
because the Martha being referred to is a LETTERBOX, and this is a <br/>
LETTERBOXING list. <br/>
<br/>
Politics have nothing to do with it. Go pick a fight elsewhere.<br/>

anti, political disrespectful aspect come from? i would suggest that people<br/>
go read the archives on this topic. what my impression was and still is -<br/>
there is a postal box out there with a martha label. kinda cute if you ask<br/>
me. i think martha would cringe if she saw my house. and that is NOT a<br/>
political statement that is pure and simple fact. seems to me that brian of<br/>
tgd owes no one an apology as he never once said anything worth apologizing<br/>
for. and i don't know anyone here so am able to remain unbiased about the<br/>
whole thing. i just don't see how politics was even brought into this until<br/>
message  41814. my aren't we a sensitive group! this whole thing is<br/>
ridiculous! i am here to learn about letterboxing and sometimes be<br/>
entertained by the laughter of something like a martha box arriving at a<br/>
house that sounds very similar to mine. right along with the plumber box<br/>
that i am hoping to receive soon. unless that is there is any plumbers out<br/>
there that might object to my sad excuse for plumbing in this house. let's<br/>
get real here people. don't take yourselves or each other so seriously. humm<br/>
.... i wonder if martha would like letterboxing?<br/>

I must agree with Kbee, you are just out of hand. Martha Stewart is <br/>
one of the greatest women of our time and deserves respect. I am also <br/>
demanding that you apologies for your behavior.<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing! It's a great hobby!<br/>
<br/>
I know that you are brand new here, so you have no idea how you have <br/>
taken the Martha posting out of context. <br/>
<br/>
There are actually four Martha Postal Letterboxes floating around out <br/>
there (if you don't yet know what a postal letterbox (PLB) is, check <br/>
the faq). Some imaginative person made this wonderful letterbox, and <br/>
there was such a demand, that they ended up having four of them. They <br/>
are now (and have been for some time) travelling about the country <br/>
landing for visits at all of the homes of people who signed up to be <br/>
on that list. I was so sad to have begun letterboxing after these <br/>
lists were closed, but I have thoroughly enjoyed all the imaginative <br/>
postings that have resulted each time "Martha" has stopped for a <br/>
visit. I have waited anxiously to hear each of her new adventures - <br/>
some of the postings have been fabulous. I've never seen any that <br/>
were disrespectful toward the real Martha - usually only self-<br/>
deprecating by the receiver. It has been a wonderful aspect of <br/>
letterboxing to me to see how creative and literary this letterboxing <br/>
community can get.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently, a couple of the "Martha" letterboxes are waiting to join <br/>
an upcoming gathering in Chicago - this is to allow more people to <br/>
stamp into these great boxes, and is very often done at gatherings. <br/>
It's the generosity of the letterboxing community at work.<br/>
<br/>
I can assure you that no political ill-will was meant by the posts <br/>
that you just recently saw. I would also suggest that if you seem <br/>
surprised by a post - think about it a little bit before responding <br/>
to remember that you are new and may not understand everything there <br/>
is to know about this great hobby. Ask the question: what are they <br/>
talking about? You can always look in the archives, too. <br/>
<br/>
I think you might want to think about contacting Brian to make an <br/>
apology for jumping to conclusions and sending an inflammatory post <br/>
without understanding the context.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome - this is a wonderful hobby - but remember - there is much to <br/>
learn. Assume the best about people and enjoy the game!<br/>

*****I think Martha would be charmed by letterboxing, and could <br/>
probably give us some really good tips on how to better carve <br/>
stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
As one who has gotten the stamp of TWO of the "Free Martha" stamps, I <br/>
think the postal series is awesome and the stories that have been <br/>
posted from the time that BusyBee first sent them out have been <br/>
hilariously funny and speak about Martha the queen of genteel <br/>
entertaining, not Martha the political figure.<br/>
<br/>
It's okay, y'all, really it is!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, my initial post was to request that the "Martha" bashing stop. <br/>
This would have been the point to explain about some sort of injoke <br/>
between some postal letterboxers. Instead, I was immediately <br/>
outrageously, cruely and rudely ridiculed. I'm the one who deserves <br/>
the apology, not the other way around. <br/>
<br/>
Second, I've done some research and since the national site has a <br/>
query feature for new boxes, it turns out I don't need to belong to <br/>
this list to stay up-to-date on what's been placed. <br/>
<br/>
So, I'm outta here. Sorry, but it's just way too mean. It's a relief <br/>
to know that the meaner or more negative posters here don't represent <br/>
all of Letterboxing. <br/>

Yep, that stands for Flame Of Week  It is time to start a new FOW, <br/>

it stand to reason the problem with the chat on this site is there <br/>
are too many politicians involved?<br/>

So let's make this week's FOW, OT, ASAP, RSVP<br/>
<br/>
And to insure you have gotten something from reading this post, <br/>
besides a frown:<br/>
Flaming Cappuccino    (6 servings)<br/>
Lemon juice <br/>
Sugar <br/>
3/4 c Galliano liqueur; divided <br/>
6 c Hot coffee; divided <br/>
2 tb Chocolate syrup; divided <br/>
1/2 c Whipping cream; whipped <br/>
6 Cinnamon sticks; 4 1/2"<br/>
Rinse glass with hot water; dry. Dip rim of glass in lemon juice, <br/>
then in sugar, making a 1/4 inch band of sugar around top of glass. <br/>
Rotate glass over flame of an Irish coffee burner or alcohol burner <br/>
until sugar crystallizes on glass. <br/>
Pour 2 tb Galliano in glass. Rotate over flame until liqueur ignites. <br/>
Fill with coffee to 1/2 inch from top of glass; stir in 1 ts <br/>
chocolate syrup. Top flaming Cappuccino with whipped cream; garnish <br/>
with a cinnamon stick. Repeat procedure for each serving. Yield: 6 <br/>
servings. <br/>

&gt; Yep, that stands for Flame Of Week  It is time to start a new FOW, <br/>
&gt; so just drop that old one in File13.  Which generates a thought . . . <br/>
&gt; with all the acronyms used in LetterBoxing, and acronyms are heavily <br/>
&gt; associated with government speak, and government = politics, wouldn't <br/>
&gt; it stand to reason the problem with the chat on this site is there <br/>
&gt; are too many politicians involved?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So let's make this week's FOW, OT, ASAP, RSVP<br/>

&gt; written in the same tongue-n-cheek humor we usually share here -- <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; the target is Mr. PotatoHead - NOT Martha.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Now you've gone too far. I thought letterboxers were kind people. But <br/>
now I am proven wrong. To speak lightly of such a sweet potato as <br/>
this calls in to question the morality and political stance of this <br/>
entire list. And since it has been done in a way that insults me so <br/>
personally, I feel that I deserve an apology. As an avid potato <br/>
lover, I feel mashed. Any half-baked attempts to weasel out of the <br/>
apology that I request will lead to me immediately leaving this list. <br/>
That should really get all of you fry lovers.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously this is a much deeper insult. Think of the poor downtrodden <br/>
potato farmers. They deserve an apology too. If this were corn or <br/>
squash or okra on the line this would be ignored, or not<br/>
villified with nearly as much glee and endless, ongoing repetition.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing in the archives for this group about ridiculing<br/>
Kenneth Lay, maker of those popular chips.<br/>
<br/>
Someone makes a fuss about a potato, and (some) people go crazy, for<br/>
months and months and months.<br/>
<br/>
Now where's MY apology?<br/>
<br/>
not quite sincerely,<br/>

idea that this list was not bashing Martha Stewart and the KMartha <br/>
and Martha Postal Letterboxes were purely satyrical. <br/>
<br/>
Also and entirely just our personal opinion.... but we didn't find a  <br/>
undertone of gross negativity in any of the posts yet. All were on <br/>
topic, nothing policital was said. Perhaps this list will have to <br/>
consult Ryan on a more consistent basis and form two seperate <br/>
responses... we can use General Hardass's posts and label them "think <br/>
skin only" and then use the Miss Janet character and present <br/>
the "wearing your heart on your sleeve" post? <br/>
<br/>
-Steve, Heidi and Madras<br/>
<br/>
Special Note - The above references to General Hardass and Miss Janet <br/>
in no way are meant to demean women or criticize the armed forces. <br/>

&gt; So, I'm outta here. Sorry, but it's just way too mean. It's a <br/>
relief <br/>

represent <br/>

you demeaning women and criticizing the armed forces.  ;o)<br/>
