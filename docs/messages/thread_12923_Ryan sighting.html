I met Ryan and Amanda on the trail where it runs through Hot Springs. <br/>
Granted, he could have just flown in with her and ruffled his hair a bit, <br/>
but as I waited in the pub, I asked some thru-hikers there if they'd met a <br/>
guy named Ryan on the trail.  They hadn't, but when I admitted I didn't know <br/>
what he looked like, just that he was a letterboxer, they realized they knew <br/>
who I was talking about.  They didn't think he'd make it that day, but 15 <br/>
minutes later, he did.<br/>
<br/>
Although it was pouring rain at the time, I did not get to see his Famous <br/>
Umbrella, but I did get his trail stamp.<br/>
