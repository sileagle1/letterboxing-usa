Patapsco Valley State Park right now!  Who cares if it's dark!  <br/>
You've got a flashlight a stamp pad and bear repellent!"<br/>
<br/>
I was just researching camping in St. Mary's County and stumbled <br/>
across a site that offers reservations for camper cabins in <br/>
Patapsco.  Unfortunately they are only available through September <br/>
30.  What wise park official decided that no one should be able to <br/>
hole up in a cabin in October?  Fall is prime time for boxing!<br/>
<br/>
So, Psychomommy, when can you put Sarah, Cat, and I up for the <br/>
night?  We won't take up too much space and if we get bored, we might <br/>
place a couple of boxes in your yard, crawlspace, toilet, etc.<br/>
(hee, hee)  <br/>
<br/>
In all seriousness, the park is not far from Frederick and its <br/>
magnetic pull is getting stronger and stronger every day.  I don't <br/>
think I need a fortuneteller to tell me that the gang will be <br/>
visiting very soon.<br/>

&gt;   SHEEP SERIES <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Patapsco Valley State Park McKeldin Area<br/>
&gt;   Nearest Town: Marriotsville, MD<br/>
&gt;   County: Carroll<br/>
&gt;   Date Placed: September 14, 2002<br/>
&gt;   Placed by: Psychomommy and The Turtle<br/>
&gt;   Clue difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt;   Hike difficulty: Easy, Approx. .7 mile hike<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   To reach the McKeldin Area: From 695, take I70 to exit 83 for <br/>
&gt; Marriotsville Road. Go North on Marriotsville Road for 4 miles to <br/>
&gt; entrance to the park on the right.<br/>
&gt;   From I70 East, take Route 40 to Marriotsville Road. Turn left. <br/>
Park <br/>
&gt; is 5 miles on the right.<br/>
&gt;   Enter park and drive to entrance gate. Be prepared to pay <br/>
&gt; $2.00/person if guard is on duty. Park at the lot ahead. Ask for a <br/>
&gt; map ($1.00, I recommend the bought over the xerox copy) <br/>
&gt;   From your car, walk back to the gate house and cross the road <br/>
&gt; heading towards the sign that says Spring Glen Trail. <br/>
&gt;   IF YOU HAVEN'T DONE FIREFLYS' MARYLAND SERIES FIRST I RECOMMEND <br/>
IT. <br/>
&gt; HERS ENDS WHERE OURS BEGIN. OTHERWISE PLEASE CONTINUE. <br/>
&gt;   Start at the Spring Glen Trail. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Box 1<br/>
&gt;   BAA BAA BLACK SHEEP<br/>
&gt;   From the map board travel along the trail to the first 2 in 1 <br/>
tree <br/>
&gt; on the left. Count 7 blue blazes (only ones facing you). See the <br/>
&gt; pines, stop at the first pine. Count 25 steps. See the large curly-<br/>
q <br/>
&gt; snake to the right! Look left. Find the fallen tree that looks like <br/>
&gt; driftwood. There you will find #1.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Box 2<br/>
&gt;   SHEEP IN THE MEADOW, COWS IN THE CORN<br/>
&gt;   Continue down the trail. Cross 2 speed bumps, STOP! Watch out for <br/>
&gt; galloping deer. The stream should be on your left. #3 speed bump - <br/>
&gt; There's fungus among us! Keep going!!! Go to the top of the hill. <br/>
&gt; Nope it's not here! Walk a little farther look for the tree with <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; knee. Stop. Look right to the cluster of trees. You will find your <br/>
&gt; treasure behind the dead one. TIP TOE THRU THE FERNS<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Box 3<br/>
&gt;   SHEEP GO TO HEAVEN, GOATS GO TO HELL<br/>
&gt;   Continue on the path to the fork in the trail. The Spring Glen is <br/>
&gt; your friend. Head for the bottom of the hill. WATCH WHERE THE'RE <br/>
&gt; LYING NOT WHERE THE'RE FLYING or you will take a trip. Hop the <br/>
&gt; stream, flowing or not. Start counting left blazes only. After the <br/>
7 <br/>
&gt; blaze look to the right for the old rock wall. Now count 2 right <br/>
&gt; blazes. See the hanging extraterrestrials!!!! Go 2 more right <br/>
blazes. <br/>
&gt; STOP Look back to ET and take 6 steps- look right in the middle of <br/>
3 <br/>
&gt; you will find what you seek.<br/>
&gt;   Continue up the hill.<br/>
&gt;                           THE END<br/>

your sleepover idea! Sure Why not! My place can handle it. Looks like <br/>
MD is trying to catch up to CT in placed boxes. The section in my <br/>
binder "to look for" is ever increasing. I might not have to go out <br/>
of state. <br/>
  I was thinking of placing some in my yard. I wouldn't mind, but I <br/>
think my boys might have a bark or 2 about it!<br/>
  LOL :-) Karin<br/>
