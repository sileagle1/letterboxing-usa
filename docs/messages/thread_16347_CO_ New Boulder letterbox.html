planted in Colorado while out visiting family this summer.<br/>
Colorado Columbine<br/>
<br/>
Planted: 6/30/03<br/>
Planted by: Ginger Blue<br/>
Location: Boulder, CO<br/>
Trail: Gentle, gradual climb uphill and down (500-600 ft gain in <br/>
elevation)<br/>
Time: About 1 hour (2 miles round trip)<br/>
<br/>
Getting There: <br/>
	From Route 36/Route 119 (28th St.) turn onto Mapleton Ave. <br/>
heading west.  Take Mapleton Ave. for 2  miles to the Mt. Sanitas <br/>
Trailhead parking area on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
	From the parking area, cross over the cement bridge to the <br/>
trailhead. Go straight past the junction of the Mt. Sanitas Trail <br/>
which starts on your left. Take the next left onto the Valley Trail, <br/>
a wide, evenly graveled trail, which is widely used by dog walkers <br/>
and baby strollers alike. If you arrive in June or July you will be <br/>
able to enjoy a variety of wildflowers as you travel along the <br/>
valley. Continue on this trail for a mile until it meets with the <br/>
Dakota Ridge Trail. Turn right here and head south on the Dakota <br/>
Ridge Trail. You will see the Valley Trail below you to your right. <br/>
As you cross again under the high tension wires, stand below the <br/>
middle wire (ignore the thinner higher wire). Count 135 paces as you <br/>
head down the trail. A sleeping boulder about 12 feet long is <br/>
sheltered from the sun by ponderosa pines. At the base of its NE <br/>
corner lies the Colorado Columbine.<br/>
	 Continue along the Dakota Ridge Trail passing interesting <br/>
rock outcrops on your left.  A couple of connecting trails on your <br/>
right will take you back to the Valley Trail. If you continue on <br/>
until the Dakota Ridge Trail turns left toward the city take a right <br/>
here heading back to the Valley Trail.  If you go straight at this <br/>
junction, at the top of the hill you will find a manmade stone <br/>
shelter on your left and stone arch on your right. From here a thin <br/>
trail will take you back to the Valley Trail. <br/>
<br/>
Note: a pace = a left footfall<br/>
