<br/>
I'm just back from two days up in the Penobscot area of Maine. I am <br/>
glad to report that the Cadillac Mountain and Thunder Hole boxes are <br/>
just fine. Someone - I can't remeber who just now - reported the <br/>
latter missing a few months ago, but it was there! It had had quite a <br/>
few visitors too, including some in February, which must have been <br/>
brutal. Nice to see Kim's stamp, and Rae, Jerry &amp; Mass Lone <br/>
Wolf's.<br/>
<br/>
I put in another Acadia National Park box at Sand Beach.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I got your clues, Warren, and will put them on the map. They won't be <br/>
posted, however, unitl Randy gets back the end of next week.<br/>
<br/>
Randy, have a good time. I haven't had time to work on the Quatrains <br/>
for a month, but hope to solve it this summer. I'm currently stumped <br/>
on the first one ('lost but never found').<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
