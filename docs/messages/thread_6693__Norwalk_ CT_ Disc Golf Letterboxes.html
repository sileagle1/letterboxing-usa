                    <html><body>Darrin and I were in Norwalk yesterday and went to play a little Disc Golf!  However, when we got up to the 8th tee, and looked for the letterbox... sadly there was no box!  We found an obvious looking mound of rocks and stuff, but no box :-(
<br/>
<br/>We did not have a chance to finish the game and find the second letterbox due to it becoming quite dark and we were in the woods without a flashlight!  (stupid huh?)  We'll try again another day for the second.  Any word on if the first box is officially missing?

I have been told that the first box was taken shortly after a <br/>
mountain bike/disc golf weekend a few months ago.  Someone even told <br/>
me the second box was missing.  After checking it out last month ... <br/>
the first box is in fact missing.  The second box was still there ... <br/>
just well hidden.  I will try to replace the first box as soon as <br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
