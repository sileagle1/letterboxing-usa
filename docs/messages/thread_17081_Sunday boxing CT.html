did the Nature of the Forest Series in People's Forest<br/>
and found everything in good order.<br/>
<br/>
We also tried again for box #1 of the Samhain Trilogy<br/>
and were sucessful but found the box strewn all over<br/>
the hillside.  The box was out of the bag, the log<br/>
book was out of the box and very wet, the stamp was<br/>
halfway down the slope.  I could not find the ink pad.<br/>
 I put everything back together and rehid it.  Lil'<br/>
Banditos will probably want to rescue the log book and<br/>
replace it or at least try to dry it out.  Too bad. <br/>
It was a nice, hand-made logbook.<br/>
