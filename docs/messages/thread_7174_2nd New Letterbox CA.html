                    <div class="plaintext-content">On August 22, 2002 Funhog placed the Towering Oaks letterbox at Woodson<br/>
Bridge State Recreation Area near Corning, Tehama County, California. This<br/>
riverside park boasts an impressive stand of Valley Oaks, the largest of<br/>
the many native oaks found in the state. Yellow-billed cuckoos are also<br/>
known to nest here.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead:  This park is located between I-5 (South Avenue exit) and<br/>
route 99, east of Corning on South Avenue. The entrance is east of the<br/>
bridge crossing the Sacramento River on the north side of the road. Do not<br/>
be misled by the adjacent RV and County Parks. Park in the day use area.<br/>
Here is a small day use fee ($2.)<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: The Nature Trail begins behind campsite #23. You can<br/>
reach this point via the paved road. Pass behind the campsite, skirting the<br/>
meadow, under the shady boughs of gargantuan trees. When you find yourself<br/>
beneath an oaken arch, there's treasure at the end of the rainbow.<br/>
