                    <div class="plaintext-content">CardinalMom and I were up to the capital city today on business and <br/>
took advantage of the opportunity to grab a few boxes while we were <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Reaching For The Stars - this stamp is one of the 'Art in Public <br/>
Places' series and took us to a really cool little park in <br/>
Westerville that was built to honor our astronauts killed in the line <br/>
of duty.  The Columbia crew is not there yet but I'm sure it will be <br/>
soon.  The signature sculpture is fantastic - perfect for it's <br/>
purpose.  The box is an easy stroll across the lawn with a nice <br/>
secluded bench by the water to stamp in on - perfect for 'boxers like <br/>
us who are less interested in the hiking aspect of the sport than <br/>
some of you.  The little box has been very busy - the logbook was <br/>
full and we added some more paper to it but it really needs it's <br/>
owners to look in on it.  It had gotten a little wet at some point <br/>
and the wood back came of the stamp but no real harm done.<br/>
<br/>
Whetstone Park - After a little confusion getting started (where are <br/>
we supposed to start pacing from?), we located both the main box and <br/>
the microbox as well.  Very nice walk - mostly level on paved or <br/>
graveled trails.  The box was very exposed and despite being housed <br/>
in an ammo box was wet inside.  The letterboxing log and stamp were <br/>
bagged and ok but the geocache stuff has a bad bag and is soaked.  <br/>
This box has also been very busy and its' logbook is filling up fast -<br/>
 the owners need to supply a little TLC.  The microbox has the <br/>
teeniest stamp we've ever seen in it and its' logsheets are <br/>
completely full.  More TLC needed.<br/>
<br/>
A Rose Is A Rose - The clues for this box lead you through the Park <br/>
Of Roses section of Whetstone Park - surely one of the largest and <br/>
most beautiful rose gardens anywhere - it's absolutely fabulous!  <br/>
Unfortunately, the clues did not lead us to the box.  The area where <br/>
it is supposed to be is very brushy with LOTS of downed logs none of <br/>
which appears to be harboring the letterbox.  The area appears to get <br/>
a lot of folks trampling around in the brush so perhaps it was <br/>
discovered and trashed or removed???  Anybody seen this one lately?<br/>

Lucky you!  We couldn't find the micro box when we looked on <br/>
7/22/03.  While we were looking a lady with a big dog came by and <br/>
told us she thought it was missing.  I guess we will have to look <br/>
again!<br/>
<br/>
The bugs were rally bad that day. We were devoured!  Now I carry bug <br/>
repellent!<br/>

<br/>
I'll be looking for this one next week.  I'll let you know if I find <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
All three of these boxes are listed as Abandoned, and I think all <br/>
were placed by the same person (Floatflute) who does not seem to be <br/>
letterboxing anymore.  If I can get that verified I will try to <br/>
adopt Reaching for the Stars, at least.  The other too are more <br/>
difficult for me to get to check on very often, but I could adopt <br/>
them as well if someone closer doesn't want to (like the lady with <br/>
the big dog!?)<br/>
<br/>
Floatflute also placed the Field of Corn box that seems to be <br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, bigguy, I'll be heading down south sometime between Aug 11-14 <br/>
with my mom (The Mad Gardener - she's new - I just made her a stamp <br/>
and named her!) to look for some of your boxes in the <br/>
Wellston/Jackson area.<br/>

now I'll be using a modified ladybug stamp and this name)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great!  I would hate to see these great locations go boxless.  I just <br/>
sent an email to floatflute asking them to either claim the boxes or <br/>
give them up for adoption - hopefully I'll get an answer.  BTW - I <br/>
noticed after we got home that franzsolo had given a hint about "A <br/>
Rose is a rose" a couple of weeks ago.  Don't know if it would have <br/>
helped us or not.  Key to the microbox is the hint about the stump <br/>
being right beside a full grown tree.<br/>
<br/>
Come on down - we'd love to have more boxers active down here.  We're <br/>
trying to get enough planted to be worth the trip.<br/>
