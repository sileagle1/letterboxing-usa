the laundry was being aired?   Just a thought and reason to take this <br/>
off list because new people surely won't want to jump into the middle <br/>
of a confrontation.  Also like to remind  folks that children are <br/>
watching.<br/>

  To St. George, coming to New York soon I might be able to get to <br/>
your new box. It seems to be in the right vicinity I have to  look at <br/>
my maps better and  plot my trip.  <br/>
   I will be leaving a few memories of the trip in New York and will <br/>
post the clues around the 4 th of July.  <br/>
<br/>
   To the Moorland Wizard ,  So glad you are back to your moor. We <br/>
have watched the  news with much interest as the story has <br/>
progressed.  The ravages of Foot and Mouth have wrecked a terrible <br/>
toll. Lets hope we are moving out of that realm forever. As dairy <br/>
farmers it is of highest concern to us that this disease and others <br/>
like it be irradicated.  So glad things are improving over there.   <br/>
Happy Boxing!    <br/>
