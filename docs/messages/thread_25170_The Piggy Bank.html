Challenge: Choose a day and go without food for the entire day; take the money you would have spent on food for the day and donate it to the fund-raising effort.  Not only will your few dollars provide food for many victims of the earthquake, but it will also give you insight into what it is like to be without the things we all take for granted, like food.<br/>
