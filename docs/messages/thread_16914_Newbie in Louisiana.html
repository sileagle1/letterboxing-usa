                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay - I'm hooked!  I've spent (way too many) hours reading about <br/>
letterboxing after stumbling upon a reference quite accidentally.  <br/>
Now I'm eager to gather my materials and try my hand at carving a <br/>
personal stamp.  Then I'll set off to find Jim Dillon's "Old <br/>
Hickory" which is only a few miles from my home.  And then, I'll <br/>
plant my first - a "Louisiana Purchase" LB in honor of the <br/>
bicentennial of that gigantic real estate deal.<br/>
<br/>
First question:  What is the average size for a personal stamp?  I'm <br/>
thinking that too small will be beyond my carving capabilities and <br/>
too large may not fit on small logbooks.  What size is "just <br/>
right"?  Thanks.<br/>

My personal stamp is carved on an eraser and is about one inch high.  <br/>
It was one of my firstr carving attempts.  It is supposed to be an <br/>
alien head.  I am not sure if that is how it looks though.<br/>
