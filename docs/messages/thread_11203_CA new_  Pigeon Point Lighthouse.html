This letterbox commemorates one of the most beautiful light stations <br/>
on the Pacific Coast.  The dramatic structure was built in 1872, in <br/>
an area rich in rugged scenery.  See www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?<br/>
page_id=533 for info.<br/>
First, a little math.  The weight of the original Fresnel lens used <br/>
here divided by 200 = "X".  The height of the lighthouse divided by <br/>
46 = "Y".<br/>
Begin your search on State Highway 1, at the entrance to the light <br/>
station.  Drive "X" miles south on Hwy. 1 to a dirt road on the <br/>
right.  From the gate with the "no parking" signs, walk "Y" paces <br/>
toward the beach.  Inspect the base of a prominent fence post on your <br/>
right.<br/>
