Austin recieved his second promotion stripe in two weeks at karate and even <br/>
sewed it on his belt himself!! He is enjoying this class alot.<br/>
Because he did not turn in all the required homework this past quarter he <br/>
has had to put his vidio games away for 5 months. He knew the price for <br/>
that, and "paid up" with out complaint.<br/>
Wow! What a weather switch a roo!<br/>
I slept in a seat shirt last night!<br/>
Thank you for dinner Friday night. It was super having an outing with you <br/>
and the famous Wanda and Pete. What a great adventure!<br/>
Did I tell you my "Thrift Store" find? 2 pair of shorts and 5 summer shirts <br/>
for $13- !!! Felt like I hit the jack pot!! : )<br/>
