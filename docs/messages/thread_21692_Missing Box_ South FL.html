I went looking yesterday for a box called "A Cure for the Common Cold" <br/>
in Boynton Beach, FL, and it was not there.  The placer states in <br/>
their clue that it is adopted by Snow-bee.  I emailed Snow-bee and <br/>
have not received a response.  Anyone know anything about it?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, that box was placed in a high-snake area - we saw one on the <br/>
path there and two in the space where the box was supposed to be.  Is <br/>
there any way to make the placer mention that it's risky looking for <br/>
it?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Having read this post, and feeling concerned that snakes were sighted <br/>
near my letterbox, I have just added a "warning" to my clues for this <br/>
box.  I hope they're not "resident" snakes and this will not be an on-<br/>
going problem.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had to handle a similar situation? Any suggestions?  <br/>
Since I live in CT and placed the box there while on vacation this <br/>
winter, I can't keep an eye on it.  Snow-Bee who does live in FL has <br/>
adopted the box and I've emailed her to ask her opinion too.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I do believe the box IS still there!<br/>
Thanks for any input - Sojourner<br/>

Here in Kernville, Ca. we sometimes have Rattlers in town. There was a <br/>
cougar attack up river a bit, and the Greenhorn mountains are loaded <br/>
with Black Bear. All of this is somewhat daunting to city folk who <br/>
only have to worry about muggers and the like. I'll take the animals.<br/>
While it may be a good idea to post a warning on your clue sheet, it <br/>
would be a better idea for a "Finder" to get information on areas they <br/>
intend to go looking for letterboxes. They should be prepared.  Atlas <br/>
Quest has a wealth of information listed under "Code of Conduct" see <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/rules. The articles cover many <br/>
security problems a letterboxer might face while in pursuit of a box.<br/>

Yes yes yes.  <br/>
<br/>
For me personally, anytime I might plan to go looking under some boardwalk or <br/>
something down in Florida, I'd certainly be ready for *some* sort of reptile <br/>
or amphibian type creature, possibly dangerous.  Isn't that the sort of place <br/>
such critters often like to hang out.  I sure wouldn't just go sticking my <br/>
hand down there.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes the gloves need to be *heavy* gloves.  We were out in the woods <br/>
looking for a box last summer in a hole in the base of a tree, and even with <br/>
work gloves on, I got a nasty bite from *something* when I was retrieving the <br/>
box.  Doctor said it was a spider bite.  All I know is that I didn't see what <br/>
did it, but the bite I ended up with turned very gross and very ugly before it <br/>
healed.  I now bring along much heavier work gloves for such places.  <br/>
<br/>
I also recently found out, to my amazement, that they sometimes have <br/>
rattlesnakes here in northern Illinois.   But I, also, as I think someone else posted, <br/>
will take the critters in dark holes over the muggers in dark alleys any old <br/>
day.<br/>

<br/>
In general, I believe it is the finder's responsibility to use common sense<br/>
when seeking boxes--often the  nooks and crannies that are so appealing to<br/>
boxers are appealing to critters as well and may become homes to snakes,<br/>
squirrels, spiders,  etc.   My kids (and I ) have learned a lot about<br/>
different wild life in the areas we box and have developed a healthy respect<br/>
for all!  And carry a stick, lol. They would have been thrilled to see<br/>
snakes, but we live in an area without poisonous ones, fortunately.<br/>

Sorry, but I never received your initial email about snakes near the <br/>
lbox.  I don't know what to say, other than I'm surprised there would <br/>
be snakes at the beach.  But, as Sojourner mentioned, I'll be checking <br/>
the box Saturday afternoon.  I will be at a workshop at the Morikami <br/>
until noon.  Would you like to meet for an exchange around 1pm at the <br/>
snakepit ;-) ?<br/>
