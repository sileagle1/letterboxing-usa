                    <div class="plaintext-content">I logged the "Charmed for Sure" and "Merrill Creek" letterboxes (in <br/>
Washington, NJ) today. There was standing water in the Charmed for Sure <br/>
box, but the contents were safe and dry inside their baggies.<br/>
<br/>
I also tried to find the Point Mountain box in Penwell, but the clues broke <br/>
down at the end. The clues are fine up to the point where you reach the <br/>
stone wall, but there is no longer any tree with 4 orange markers, which <br/>
makes it practically impossible to find the box. This box was planted in <br/>
June 1999, and it looks like new blaze markers have been put up since that <br/>
time.  The box is unclaimed -- I don't know who "Floater" is and there's no <br/>
contact info on the clue, so this one may be a hopeless cause.<br/>
