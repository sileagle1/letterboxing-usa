I have seen mention of the "three furies boxes" here but don't recognize the <br/>

Won't be long before we run out of boxes to find, close to home.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
The Three Furies' Crone Tree box clue was sent to me directly. It is <br/>
being redone because of some problems. This was their very first box <br/>
and they wanted me to check it out. Really nice folks who are local <br/>
to San Luis Obispo area. They are going to be an incredible force in <br/>
the boxing community for years, I predict.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, there are times when the clues to a box are private, not <br/>
posted anywhere or only posted on a private site or only in another <br/>
box or travel around from box to box (cuckoo clues.)<br/>
<br/>
As far as running out of local boxes, hmmm. Have you got all of the <br/>
Redwall boxes yet? If you have at least two, you can ask JugglerMouse <br/>
for her large Martin the Warrior and ask me for my Urthstripe stamps. <br/>
We carry them with us. How are you doing on the Camelot series at El <br/>
Chorro park? Have you got the ones out at Montana del Oro? How about <br/>
the Haunted Mine?<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, there are the ones that Princess Lea and Sleepy Cat <br/>
put in up highway 101. And if you have not been down to get the <br/>
Critters of Ennisbrook, hurry down there right away. <br/>
<br/>
If all else fails, you could plant some while you wait for October <br/>
4th SLO Stamping in the Meadow. I understand there will be quite a <br/>
few in that meeting for you. Or, you can arrange for some exchanges <br/>
if you know of any other letterboxers in your area (*ahem*)<br/>
<br/>
Glad you are so avid; me, too,<br/>
