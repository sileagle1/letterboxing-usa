                    <div class="plaintext-content">The National Park Service's policy may also apply to National Monuments,<br/>
as well, such as Mt. St. Helens and the Oregon Caves.  I can't be sure,<br/>
but I know the Golden Eagle pass gets you into them.  Therefore, it's a<br/>
safe bet that they monitor monuments, too.<br/>
<br/>
Lobbyists tend to cost a lot of money, but I suppose we could all make a<br/>
grassroots effort and write to our representatives about this policy if<br/>
we want to.   <br/>
<br/>
As for me, I will respect the NPS' wishes as far as the placing of<br/>
letterboxes is concerned.  However, this summer I did get a couple boxes<br/>
that the NPS oversees and was successful in stamping in.  There are so<br/>
many great places that don't get as much traffic or attention, so I can<br/>
do my letterboxing there.<br/>
