Any help would be appreciated....<br/>
<br/>
Here's the situation:  when someone contacts me using the "Contact the <br/>
Placer" function on LBNA, sometimes a CC: is sent to another boxer.  <br/>
<br/>
Choi mentioned this might be because another boxer is listed as the <br/>
maintainer but...<br/>
- I see no options to set the maintainer on any box<br/>
- I only found one reference to "maintainer" on the LBNA site and here <br/>
is the quote: "Changed Contact the Placer page to be based on box <br/>
number and to send e-mail to both owner and maintainer."<br/>
- I asked the person who is being CC:ed and they were not aware of <br/>
setting anything on these boxes to become the maintainer.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there familiar with this concept?<br/>

maintained by its original owner you should first try contacting the <br/>
owner to see if they have any objection.  If you don't receive a <br/>
response then contact the webmasters of the LbNA and let them know <br/>
that you would like to have responsibility for the box.  The <br/>
webmasters will then give you "maintainer" status for the box.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The main reason we have maintainers of boxes is the LBNA website used <br/>
to be completely handled by the webmasters. You would post your clues <br/>
on this talk list and the webmasters would put the clues up on the <br/>
LBNA website. This was a lot of work for a few people. When they <br/>
changed the website so that each individual could update and post <br/>
their own clues directly to the website, many of the old letterboxes <br/>
were being abandoned. Their original owners were no longer involved <br/>
in the hobby and hundreds of clues were going to be lost (with <br/>
letterboxes in the woods abandoned with no clues to them!!) So many <br/>
of us "adopted" the clues that would have fallen by the wayside. I <br/>
adopted many of the boxes in NC even though I have never visited <br/>
those letterboxes. I just made the clues available on the LBNA <br/>
website. So when folks email me about a problem with the letterbox, I <br/>
am often "clueless" as to what they are talking about! When I get <br/>
enough feedback that the clues need to be changed, I will try to <br/>
change them, if a box is missing, I will report that in the clues <br/>
etc. But I totally rely on the feedback from the contact the placer <br/>
feature because I never planted the box and I have never visited the <br/>
box in many instances. I just maintain the clues.<br/>
