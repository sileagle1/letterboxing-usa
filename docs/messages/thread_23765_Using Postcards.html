  I was thinking of something oldfashion with letterboxing. I was<br/>
  thinking of setting up a letterbox that you would have to send a<br/>
  postcard with your stamp on it to a post office box. You would not<br/>
  have to put you own return address on the postcard.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I seem to recall seeing pre-stamped postcards in a Chuck &amp; Molly <br/>
letterbox in Pomfret CT. The purpose of those postcards wasn't to <br/>
send the finder's personal stamp image, but instead to just drop <br/>
Chuck a line.<br/>
<br/>
Pre-stamped postcards are probably the best way to go. Then you <br/>
could also pre-address them, and perhaps even number then so you <br/>
would have some idea of how many postcards are left in the leterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest that you plant the letterbox in a place the <br/>
would encourage only the serious letterboxers since the postcards <br/>
may have a tendency to disappear otherwise.<br/>

I will frequently leave a bunch of self-addressed, stamped postcards with <br/>
the box image on one side in the box and it's always a treat when people <br/>
send them back to me with their signature stamps and comments about how <br/>
the box is doing.  I love fun mail!!  :)<br/>
