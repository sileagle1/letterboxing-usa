<div>Has anyone found a good and inexpensive container? 
I've noticed that the cheap Tupperware types do not seem to last. I have 
put out a couple of plastic jars with screw on lids ( formerly Skippy chunk ) 
and covered them with brown duct tape. The size seems to work, but I don't care 
for p-nut butter morning, noon, and night. I am also experimenting with 1 qt. 
cans from Home Depot in areas that shouldn't get much rainfall. Anyone have a 
better idea?  On another subject-- Unless you put a LB on private property 
with an owners permission , you are technically littering, and that would 
be true whether it be a Nat. Park, Nat. Monument or Nat. Forest. Box on 
!    DON </div></body></html>

<div>I usually use the $3.50 tupperware box. Recently, 
however, I purchased some very tight hinged plastic containers at the going 
out of business sale at Ann &amp; Hopes. I plan to check into Wal-Mart one 
of these days to see if they have something similar.</div>

using PVC pipe with end caps if the end caps are cheap you can buy a <br/>
long piece of pipe and cut it to lengths you want. I to think there <br/>

The containers that I use are plastic jars that I got from American Science
and Surplus  (www.sciplus.com) they were cheap, watertight and no
food odor.  I checked their website and the list a couple of letterboxable
items under the category of plastic jars.

<br/>
On the topic of containers, I generally head for dollar stores or<br/>
grocerty outlet type places and find the cheap containers (under $1) and<br/>
they've worked great for me.  The key to protecting the objects within,<br/>
I've found, is to double up on the ziplocks.  At least that's what I<br/>
think.  <br/>
<br/>
So far the best all around containers are the those sort of clear<br/>
Rubbermaid rectangular containers with the ivory-colored lids.  The<br/>
worst are school pencil pouches, though, those can be moderately<br/>
successful in places that get less weather and as long as the goods are<br/>
double-ziplocked, but they're not going to win any gold stars for being<br/>
sturdy.  Gladware, which is flimsy and will probably crack over the test<br/>
of time also gets a thumbs down from me. Great for leftovers, but not<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
It's probably not a really great idea to use containers that once<br/>
contained food, unless you really wash, wash, wash and wash them.<br/>
Animals have an awfully good sense of smell and I reckon they might<br/>
think there is more to find in those boxes than a hand-carved stamp and<br/>
a letterboxing log.  They might haul off with it and find a new hiding<br/>
place for the box that no one but them can find!<br/>
<br/>

Although we originally used the $1.19 beige-and-clear containers<br/>
from Stop&amp;Shop, RIBNAG has switched brands... The RubberMaid 1.2<br/>
Quart containers, with the clear box and blue lid-with-a-lip, work<br/>
simply wonderfully.  We decided to switch after noticing that all<br/>
Cock-A-Doodle-Moo's boxes consisted of these, and we have yet to<br/>
find one in bad shape.  They cost about $3.50 each, but really, if<br/>
we put a $5 stamp (or, if hand carved, essentially irreplaceable),<br/>
a logbook (always irreplaceable), and a $2 ink pad in the box, it<br/>
makes sense to not skimp on the single most important part of the<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, we still use the ziplocks, including carrying around<br/>
a few extra to help out boxes in need.<br/>
<br/>
Just our $0.02 (times 10?)<br/>

I have seen letterboxes in miliary ammo containers. The box was a <br/>
geocache hybrid. It didn't bother me that the stamp was in an ammo box. <br/>
It did kind of bother me that I could see it from 500 yards away. I <br/>
don't think it is the best container for hiding a stamp and logbook. <br/>
Some people will say that an ammo container might be either a bomb <br/>
(yikes!) or could confuse people in that it might be a bomb. I don't <br/>
think that way, however I can see that it would cause concern among <br/>
lboxers. <br/>
In my opinion, I would choose a different container. If you don't want <br/>
to do that, I would at least let the reader know in the clues what to <br/>
expect. <br/>
Aren't ammo cases harder to hide?<br/>
Best of luck,<br/>

You know, I think they would work fine and cannot believe that many <br/>
folks would get too upset by them. Problem, as I see it, is that they <br/>
are large and that folks would want to steal them. <br/>
<br/>
Now if you want to send them to me...I could send you Tupperware in <br/>
return. *grin*<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">personally, the only place I have seen ammo related things considered is in<br/>
Dartmoor.  Out there, they used to hid them in shell casings and such, but<br/>
the problem was that it is still an area used for military drills so<br/>
sometimes things looking like a letterbox could actually be undetonated<br/>
ammo.  That could get a smidge dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
When I was starting I actually bought a couple of military first aid cases<br/>
from the local army surplus store and considered using them, but then I<br/>
decided that they were a little too big.  I also seemed to have a somewhat<br/>
better seal from the rubbermaid.  (I actually left them all weighted down in<br/>
a sink full of water overnight just to see-how obsessive is that?)  I was a<br/>
bit sad not to use them until I met Don and Gwen and saw what they were<br/>
doing with a great old cigar box (that looks suspiciously like it was stolen<br/>
directly from the LBNA website:).  Now my GI first-aid case houses all my<br/>
carving supplies.  I love it.  It has personality.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever choice you make is up to you.  I say go for it if you want to use<br/>
them, but if it is in an area that it could be mistaken for something else,<br/>
you might want to use caution.<br/>
