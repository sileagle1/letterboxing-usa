LbNA was actually the target of the DoS attack?! And not one of the<br/>
other websites that's hosted on the same server?<br/>
<br/>
That's pretty cruddy of the hosting service to essentially shut down<br/>
your website because they couldn't prevent a DoS attack that you have<br/>
no control over. But why the database? Seems like they should have<br/>
shut down your web server rathern than the database which is protected<br/>
behind the web server.<br/>
<br/>
That really ticks me off, though. It just seems wrong to me that<br/>
they'd shut down your database for something that's their fault for<br/>
allowing to happen in the first place. Just plain wrong....<br/>

I used DoS in a loose sense. The attack was against the LbNA search scripts<br/>
rather than a more sophisticated DoS attack. The result was heavy load our<br/>
database.<br/>
