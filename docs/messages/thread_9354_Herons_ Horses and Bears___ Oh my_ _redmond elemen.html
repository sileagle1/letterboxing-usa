the Water Elemental.  I got to see it fly across the water and land <br/>
high on a very tall dead tree.  Shortly later I got to watch it <br/>
swoop away.<br/>
<br/>
When exactly do bears hibernate, anyway?<br/>
<br/>
I'm so pleased these boxes have already received visitors.  I barely <br/>
got back to my car before it was completely dark (must remember to <br/>
start earlier this time of year) so I didn't get to check up on the <br/>
other two boxes... however, at last check they were doing quite <br/>
well.  =D<br/>

Who knows?  Anyway, I forgot to mention that when we last went to <br/>
find the first two boxes and had seen the bear sighting warnings all <br/>
over--can you believe we actually found Candlelight's Black Bear Paw <br/>
Hitchhiker LB prowling around the Treefrog Letterbox that very day?  <br/>
What perfect timing?  ;)  <br/>
