letterbox when we were on Grand Cayman Island for vacation. It was in <br/>
fine shape- a bit well hidden- we had to dig a bit for it probably from <br/>
hurricane debris and wade through some dense vegetation to get to the <br/>
tree, but it was there. We actually were the first to stamp in. <br/>
Hopefully they'll get that glitch fixed on the site so folks can find <br/>
the international boxes again. If you hadn't replied we never would have <br/>
known it was there. Thanks for the cute little frog stamp!<br/>

&gt;&gt;of any letterboxes in the Cayman Islands (which I'm doubting since I <br/>
&gt;&gt;don't even see that listed as an option). I'm going down there soon. <br/>
&gt;&gt;Even if there aren't any to find I'm thinking I just might have to <br/>

&gt;&gt;it "Letterbox from Hell" LOL!<br/>
