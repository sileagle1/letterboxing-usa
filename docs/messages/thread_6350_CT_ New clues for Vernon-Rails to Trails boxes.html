Could you please change the clues for the Vernon-Rails to Trails <br/>
letterboxes located in Vernon, Tolland County, Connecticut.  Box #1 <br/>
was soaked and had to be replaced.  We transfered as much as we could <br/>
read from the soaked book.  As a precaution, we double bagged the <br/>
logbooks, hopefully future stampers will continue to do so.  We also <br/>
moved box #2.  We recently checked that box and found that some non-<br/>
letterboxers found it and drew some inappropriate pictures in the <br/>
logbook.  We are hoping that it won't be spotted as easily in it's <br/>
new location.  Here are the new clues:<br/>
<br/>
Vernon-Rails to Trails Letterbox<br/>
Vernon, Tolland County, Connecticut<br/>
<br/>
3 mile long hike (or bike if you'd like) down the track and back.<br/>
Approximate time: 1 to 1 1/2 hours, depending on how fast you walk.<br/>
Originally planted by Team Weems on 9/30/01. Re-planted on 7/20/02.<br/>
<br/>

right onto Route 30.  At the first light take a right onto Dobson <br/>
