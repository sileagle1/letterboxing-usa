were missing.  We took advantage of the day off yesterday to go check up on<br/>
them.  Both were still hidden, in fine shape and had been visited recently.  At<br/>
Black Point the kids searched the tidal pools for crabs while I braved the<br/>
poison ivy to go check on the LB.  It was a perfect day with the wild<br/>
blueberries in peak perfection and the wild roses spreading their heavy scent<br/>
on the trail.  Fortunately I am not particularly sensitive to poison ivy...<br/>
<br/>
Also, I updated the clues to Viking Ships slightly to accomodate changes in the<br/>
area.<br/>
