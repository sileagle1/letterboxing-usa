Redwood Regional Park<br/>
City:  Oakland<br/>
(Alameda County, CA)<br/>
<br/>
planted by PrincessLea on March 27, 2003<br/>
terrain: steep and steady<br/>
roundtrip distance - less than 1 mile, but somewhat arduous going up<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  580 or 13 freeway exit Redwood Road - proceed east on<br/>
Redwood, approximately 2 1/4 miles past Skyline Blvd.  Park entrance<br/>
is at the Redwood Gate - it will be a left hand turn.  Proceed to the<br/>
furthest parking lot, about 1/2 mile.  There is a $4 parking fee on<br/>
weekends from April to October.<br/>
<br/>
Find the path beyond the California State bird, marked by a golden<br/>
sign.  When you reach the East, uncover the mystery of the<br/>
moss-covered stone -  it will tell you who might have walked by this<br/>
spot during the night.<br/>
<br/>
The Latin name for the critter who made these tracks is "Procyon<br/>
Lotor;" "lotor" meaning "washer." The common name originated from<br/>
the Algonquin word "arakun," which means "he scratches with his<br/>
hands."<br/>
