&gt;Oh!  It just gets better and better!  I didn't get any letterboxes but I <br/>
&gt;DID get poison oak!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Eeek!  Itchy! Itchy!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Any relief advice from the veterans?<br/>
<br/>
Just as with poison ivy, the best relief comes from calamine lotion or <br/>
spray. I like Band-Aid Fast Relief Calamine Spray, which has benzocaine in <br/>
it to quickly cool the itchy area -- and without making you rub lotion into <br/>
your skin. Other treatments, like Bactine (which my mom always used on us <br/>
as kids for everything from bug bites to poison ivy) or hydrocortisone <br/>
anti-itch creams won't really provide much relief from the itch of poison <br/>
oak or poison ivy.<br/>
<br/>
I have an article about poison ivy on my site, along with photos, but I <br/>
don't have any photos of poison oak or poison sumac (which manufacture the <br/>
same chemical, urushiol, as poison ivy, but aren't generally found here in <br/>
the Northeast). I did encounter some poison oak in CA last fall -- well, I <br/>
didn't actually "encounter" it myself, I only identified it as my <br/>
letterboxing partner was searching through a patch of it. Of course, she <br/>
was a little miffed that I hadn't identified it a few moments sooner, but <br/>
fortunately (for both of us <g>) she didn't catch any! And I didn't even <br/>
have my camera with me at the time, so I could have taken a picture (of the <br/>
poison oak, not the stern look on her face).....<br/>
