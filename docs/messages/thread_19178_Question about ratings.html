Should we consider the "difficulty" rating (which talks more about <br/>

Rating a letterobx is very subjective, and everyone does it in a <br/>
slightly different manner.  An 'easy' hike for me is 'hard' for <br/>
someone else.  And even the rating system on Silent Doug's website is <br/>
open for argument.  I might rate a box one thing while using the <br/>
exact same rating system, someone else might rate it something <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
As a whole, rating other people's boxes is discouraged--it tends to <br/>
hurt feelings.  Rating your own box is fine, but there's not a <br/>
standard and trying to create one is a futile effort.  There will <br/>
never be a consensus for one, and even if there was, there's no way <br/>
to ensure people conform to them.  So my suggestion is make up your <br/>
own rating system and use it, but qualify it with a description of <br/>
how your rating system works.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, good idea -- when I get back from my current travels, I'll modify the <br/>
ratings to make the "difficulty" component apply more directly to the <br/>
clues, which was the intention when I first put it together. I do see now <br/>
that it could be clearer, so I'll be happy to adjust it accordingly.<br/>

<br/>
I've seen another rating system out there (I think it's on the WOL <br/>
board) that uses a number of factors.  In my opinion, while this <br/>
rating system attempts to explain a number of variables, it's too <br/>
long and not easily decipherable. <br/>
<br/>
Not to pick on WOL, which is yet another great resource for <br/>
letterboxers, I notice that the site does allow others to rate the <br/>
letterboxes they find.  We can certainly debate whether such a <br/>
feature is a good idea or not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, perhaps a standard across all websites listing letterboxes <br/>
isn't necessary, but if the major ones (LbNA mostly, and perhaps WOL) <br/>
instituted a "standard" system, I think that would be valuable.<br/>

Just my 2 worth, anyway.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think that geocaching is a great sport but it is a different sport <br/>
than letterboxing.  One of the things that I like best about <br/>
letterboxing is the creativity and individuality that letterboxing <br/>
offers.  I think that it should be up to the placer to decide if <br/>
they want to rate their box, have their box tracked, etc.  Many <br/>
boxes have an element of mystery about them that adding a rating <br/>
system would destroy.  I don't want to have to hold my clues to any <br/>
standard but my own.<br/>
<br/>
By reading the clues carefully, doing research on the area or asking <br/>
local boxers you can usually gather enough information to form your <br/>
own opinion on the difficulty of the box.  <br/>
<br/>
IMO, let geocaching be geocaching where you can accurately detail <br/>
and track everything related to it and let letterboxing remain the <br/>
way it is.  There is plenty of room out there for two different, but <br/>
related sports.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sorry, but I have to agree with Ryan that attempting to get all <br/>
of the boxes listed on the LbNA or WOL or any other site to conform <br/>
to a certain rating system is futile.  For one thing, it is asking <br/>
everyone to agree and with something subjective, and with this many <br/>
people, there is not ever going to be agreement.  Everyone has a <br/>
different scale they use to rate both terrain and clues.  How you <br/>
assess these things is dependent on so many factors -- things that <br/>
each of use views differently based on preference, physical <br/>
condition, mental capability, interest, past experience and time.<br/>
<br/>
Not to mention the fact that there are a great many people <br/>
participating in this hobby who do not want to rate their boxes.  <br/>
Not that they are intentionally trying to make it difficult for a <br/>
seeker, but in many cases, the unknown is part of the mystery of a <br/>
box.  Yes, perhaps a universal rating system would make it easier <br/>
for seekers, but there are many who do not see "making it easy to <br/>
find the box" as an integral part of this game.  Seems to me like <br/>
just another attempt to make it all black and white -- and to me <br/>
that equates with boring and unexciting.<br/>
<br/>
Rate your boxes if you wish, but it is a personal decision -- don't <br/>
try to spread it across the group as a whole or even standardize it <br/>
for those who do use some sort of a rating system.  If you are the <br/>
type of person who needs to know what you are in for before you set <br/>
out on a letterbox hunt -- there are boxes for you, where everything <br/>
is spelled out.  Granted there are many boxes that are not, but not <br/>
all boxes are for all people -- you need to choose the ones that are <br/>
comfortable for you.  And if it is such a huge concern that this <br/>
information is not available for all boxes, maybe this is the wrong <br/>
hobby, as the "unknown" is in my mind a material part of <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>

&gt; I'm sorry, but I have to agree with Ryan that attempting to get <br/>
all <br/>
&gt; of the boxes listed on the LbNA or WOL or any other site to <br/>
conform <br/>
&gt; to a certain rating system is futile.  For one thing, it is asking <br/>
&gt; everyone to agree and with something subjective, and with this <br/>
many <br/>
&gt; people, there is not ever going to be agreement.  Everyone has a <br/>
&gt; different scale they use to rate both terrain and clues.  How you <br/>
&gt; assess these things is dependent on so many factors -- things that <br/>
&gt; each of use views differently based on preference, physical <br/>
&gt; condition, mental capability, interest, past experience and time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not to mention the fact that there are a great many people <br/>
&gt; participating in this hobby who do not want to rate their boxes.  <br/>
&gt; Not that they are intentionally trying to make it difficult for a <br/>
&gt; seeker, but in many cases, the unknown is part of the mystery of a <br/>
&gt; box.  Yes, perhaps a universal rating system would make it easier <br/>
&gt; for seekers, but there are many who do not see "making it easy to <br/>
&gt; find the box" as an integral part of this game.  Seems to me like <br/>
&gt; just another attempt to make it all black and white -- and to me <br/>
&gt; that equates with boring and unexciting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rate your boxes if you wish, but it is a personal decision -- <br/>
don't <br/>
&gt; try to spread it across the group as a whole or even standardize <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; for those who do use some sort of a rating system.  If you are the <br/>
&gt; type of person who needs to know what you are in for before you <br/>
set <br/>
&gt; out on a letterbox hunt -- there are boxes for you, where <br/>
everything <br/>
&gt; is spelled out.  Granted there are many boxes that are not, but <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; all boxes are for all people -- you need to choose the ones that <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; comfortable for you.  And if it is such a huge concern that this <br/>
&gt; information is not available for all boxes, maybe this is the <br/>
wrong <br/>
&gt; hobby, as the "unknown" is in my mind a material part of <br/>
&gt; letterboxing.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  I think that geocaching is a great sport but it is a different sport <br/>
  than letterboxing.  One of the things that I like best about <br/>
  letterboxing is the creativity and individuality that letterboxing <br/>
  offers.  I think that it should be up to the placer to decide if <br/>
  they want to rate their box, have their box tracked, etc.  Many <br/>
  boxes have an element of mystery about them that adding a rating <br/>
  system would destroy.  I don't want to have to hold my clues to any <br/>
  standard but my own.<br/>
<br/>
  By reading the clues carefully, doing research on the area or asking <br/>
  local boxers you can usually gather enough information to form your <br/>
  own opinion on the difficulty of the box.  <br/>
<br/>
  IMO, let geocaching be geocaching where you can accurately detail <br/>
  and track everything related to it and let letterboxing remain the <br/>
  way it is.  There is plenty of room out there for two different, but <br/>
  related sports.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are some rating systems folks use.  A difficulty is the wide variety of terrain-types in North America.  I've hiked a lot of them (Thanks, Uncle Sam!) and I'm here to tell you that a rocky climb of 300 feet at 45 degrees lift in the Rockies is significantly different from a rocky climb of 300 feet at 45 degrees lift in the Ozarks or Appalachians.  A two mile hike in the swamps is very different in Georgia than in New Jersey or Missouri.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of subjective vectors, like flora and fauna and effects of altitude and humidity and season.<br/>
Try, if it strikes your fancy, but I shouldn't rely on it. <br/>

<br/>
  I'm sorry Ryan, I disagree with you on this aspect.  I don't think it's<br/>
  futile at all.  I think that Letterboxers in North America, or even the<br/>
  world over can come together on a consensus.  Just because you don't<br/>
  want to rate your boxes and think that a rating system is a complete<br/>
  waste of time, does not mean that others feel the same way.  That's what<br/>
  makes this hobby so wonderful.  I think a system needs to be in place<br/>
  that CAN be used, not that's forced down anyone's throat. A system that<br/>
  allows for the simplest of use, yet covers as broad a spectrum as<br/>
  possible. One that is updated frequently, as needed, and is letterbox<br/>
  specific.<br/>
<br/>
  Just my thoughts.<br/>

ring. (Never was such a thing anyway, thought there were a ton of other secret decoder rings.)   If you'd taken a <br/>
moment to look at the site that generates that string of letters and numbers, you'd see it also has a decoder built <br/>
in.  Given that fact, it's a lot easier to decipher than the PFX sig that most use.<br/>
<br/>
Course, I've always thought that a number system, ranging from 1 to 5, 1 being the easiest and 5 being the hardest, an <br/>
easy way to rate something. You know, just like when you are in the hospital and the nurse asks you to rate your pain <br/>
level?  Or the National Pediatric system which uses faces and numbers so that children can indicate their pain level.  <br/>
I've also thought that a system that helped take into effect the relative skill level of the person answering the <br/>
questionnaire was a bit less subjective.<br/>
<br/>
But that's just my opinion, not meant to upset or antagonize anyone.<br/>

<br/>
Her Ladyship has taken her precious time to evaluate the rating <br/>
system you propose and in fact it does not, as we facetiously <br/>
stated, require a secret decoder ring it does however use a decoder <br/>
that requires just a tad more hardware (which can't even be made <br/>
into a smart accessory or jewelry). Her Ladyship thought this <br/>
activity was about creative self-expression as well as enjoying <br/>
Mother Nature's many blessings. If this is indeed the case then dear <br/>
Mr. Costly has made our point for us. Why must we use a string of <br/>
cold unfriendly numbers when we could apply our thinking caps and <br/>
exercise our verbal skills and type an easily understood description <br/>
of the location, which any English speaker can understand? Why must <br/>
we continually replace the written word with numbers and acronyms <br/>
and emoticons? Have we all become so illiterate that we're reduced <br/>
to pointing and numbers and using pictures and guttural sounds to <br/>
communicate? Alas, every teenager her Ladyship has met seems to <br/>
communicate in groans and grunts and eructation so I suppose you may <br/>
be onto something. Her Ladyship however shall continue to poise her <br/>
jeweled Monblanc fountain pen in her graceful, delicate petit main <br/>
over her gilt edged Crane 20lb. rag paper stationary when rating her <br/>
letterbox locations.<br/>

     There seems to be a miscommunication here and I do apologize for that.  You may, as I have always stated and <br/>
always will, choose to use what you will.  There are many ways of rating ones letterboxes and, since it is, after all, <br/>
your letterbox, I would assume nothing other than you be allowed the freedom to do with what you will where tools are <br/>
concerned.<br/>
<br/>
     Should you choose to carve your stamps by flashlight using a screwdriver, that is, after all, your prerogative.  <br/>
Should you choose to commission a individual, professionally made stamp from your artwork, for each letterbox, that <br/>
is, after all, your prerogative.  Should you choose to only hide microboxes, that is, after all, your prerogative.<br/>
<br/>
     I have always said that5 there needs to be guidelines within which each person is allowed the freedom to choose <br/>
what fits them best. The belief that one size fits all only works with Spandex and certain other fabrics that some <br/>
people should NOT be attempting to squeeze themselves into. (NO innuendo meant in that statement about anyone at <br/>
all).  That's all I've ever said and that's all I will ever say. Never will anyone hear me say that my way is the only <br/>
way, unless of course, they are listening to me talking to my son, who's 12 going on 18 and testing the boundaries of <br/>
his freedoms (soft smiles).<br/>
<br/>
     I am thrilled that you shall continue to use the format for rating your letterboxes that you feel most <br/>
comfortable with.  Perhaps one can stop being prissy about things and allow others the freedom to do as they choose <br/>
and to converse about it without a sharp retort from the LbNA's own Miss Manners.  One can always hope.<br/>

We intended no offense at all, perhaps we are indeed plagued by <br/>
miscommunication.<br/>

We cannot however let this statement stand; "The belief that one <br/>

I give his rating system a 3.7A-,<br/>
but the overall writing gets a c9B2alpha.<br/>

<br/>
  Dearest Mr. Haus,<br/>
<br/>
  Her Ladyship has taken her precious time to evaluate the rating <br/>
  system you propose and in fact it does not, as we facetiously <br/>
  stated, require a secret decoder ring it does however use a decoder <br/>
  that requires just a tad more hardware (which can't even be made <br/>
  into a smart accessory or jewelry). Her Ladyship thought this <br/>
  activity was about creative self-expression as well as enjoying <br/>
  Mother Nature's many blessings. If this is indeed the case then dear <br/>
  Mr. Costly has made our point for us. Why must we use a string of <br/>
  cold unfriendly numbers when we could apply our thinking caps and <br/>
  exercise our verbal skills and type an easily understood description <br/>
  of the location, which any English speaker can understand? Why must <br/>
  we continually replace the written word with numbers and acronyms <br/>
  and emoticons? Have we all become so illiterate that we're reduced <br/>
  to pointing and numbers and using pictures and guttural sounds to <br/>
  communicate? Alas, every teenager her Ladyship has met seems to <br/>
  communicate in groans and grunts and eructation so I suppose you may <br/>
  be onto something. Her Ladyship however shall continue to poise her <br/>
  jeweled Monblanc fountain pen in her graceful, delicate petit main <br/>
  over her gilt edged Crane 20lb. rag paper stationary when rating her <br/>
  letterbox locations.<br/>

&gt;Although I haven't planted any letterboxes yet, I'm curious about how<br/>
&gt;people rate them.  SilentDoug has a great rating system on his<br/>
&gt;website (http://www.letterboxing.info/rating/key.php) based on the<br/>
&gt;rating system used by Geocachers.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I updated the text in the rating system to make it a bit clearer <br/>
regarding the difficulty of the clues.<br/>

As always, comments are welcome.<br/>
