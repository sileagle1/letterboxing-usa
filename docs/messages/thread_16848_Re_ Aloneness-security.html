  There was an excellent thread of discussion on the topic of "what <br/>
to bring when letterboxing" which had wonderful suggestions.  Perhaps <br/>
you could search for this discussion.<br/>
  Walking alone is liberating and allows me to clear my mind and open <br/>
my spirit to the joys of nature.  Unleashed dogs can be a great <br/>
worry.  However, since living with my daughter's 2 large dogs for the <br/>
past several months, learning dog language, so to speak (again, this <br/>
issue was discussed in great detail here)this personal fear is not so <br/>
large. <br/>
  I just figure, in the scheme of things, a person is a heck of a lot <br/>
safer from random acts of violence/unkindness out in the woods v.s. <br/>
in the local mall, for instance (plus the trip does not cost a dime). <br/>

<br/>
I also carry a cell phone with a GPS, a hunting knife, real mace, a <br/>
piercing shriek device, a switchblade, and a hickory walking stick <br/>
that's the same size as the bowstaff I used to train with in shotokan <br/>
and strong enough to kill a man or animal.<br/>

I'm more worried about falling off a cliff than meeting danger with a <br/>
person.  I'm more likely to meet danger with a wild animal, though <br/>
the only ones I've encountered thus far are coyote and deer.  And a <br/>
very good at heart dog with a very poor master, and a downright mean <br/>
dog with a downright mean master.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I am more likely to be hassled in full public than in the woods <br/>
someplace.  Last bit of hassling hustle was in the Tulleries in <br/>
Paris, not exactly a quiet remote spot, not unless those 2000 plus <br/>
other people around enjoying a Sunday stroll count for solitude.  I <br/>
gave the guy my Piss Off look which is well understood in any <br/>
language.  On the other hand I hiked 15 miles from Fontainebleau to <br/>
Melun through the forest and met several other outdoor people ( <br/>
mushroomers and bikers) and didn't give it a second thought.<br/>
<br/>
I walk boldly and give everyone I meet a good look.<br/>
<br/>
I carry my walk and poke stick which is vital for boxing in the land <br/>
of nettles, wet soggy holes and blackberries.<br/>
<br/>
I am of a certain age and grew up in the Seattle area during <br/>
the "reign" of Ted Bundy and Green River Killer.  I figure if I let <br/>
people like this steal my life from me I might as well lock my door, <br/>
turn out the lights and rot.  I refuse to let the media dictate to me <br/>
what I should believe in or be frightened of.<br/>
<br/>
Sensible prudence is certainly good, but shutting your life down. <br/>
No.  You may want to check in with a local self defense class.  <br/>
Invest is a few personal safety devices ( legal ones) and perhaps a <br/>
visit to the doctor if you feel this is overwhelming your life to the <br/>
point of shutting down.  Anxiety to some extent is normal, but it <br/>
should not keep you from participating in life.<br/>
<br/>
Try to link up with boxers in your area.  I am not a great social <br/>
gadabout but have found all the local boxers I have met to <br/>
be "kindred spirits" who enjoy the many aspects of our hobby and are <br/>
eager to share it with you.  I am sure if you reach out and look for <br/>
a boxing buddy , you will find someone to share with.<br/>
