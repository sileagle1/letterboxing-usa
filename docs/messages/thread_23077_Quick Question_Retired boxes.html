                    <div class="plaintext-content">Don, a poll is a really good idea.  This question/topic does seem to <br/>
be one of the recurring kind and a poll would let everyone who wanted <br/>
to voice an opinion.  Might I suggest an alternative to just a Yes or <br/>
No question?  I'm not sure if this could be done (not tech savvy) or <br/>
should be done, but could we have a catagory like the basement for <br/>
retired boxes?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> i can't help but think this is so funny. wasn't it just a couple of days<br/>
ago that there was post upon post of near panic because lbna was down? and<br/>
now there is post upon post of complaining about the types, numbers, retired<br/>
 missing, what ever you wish to call it boxes. unbelievable. <br/>
<br/>
maybe i have a different way of looking at it. i don't see lbna as only a<br/>
place to get clues. i see it as a piece of living history. letterboxes of<br/>
the past and letterboxes of the now. if a placer has not marked their box as<br/>
missing and i go to look it for it and i don't find it...... no big deal. i<br/>
still have gotten out, i still have seen the place that the placer intended<br/>
me to see, i still enjoyed myself, and i still know that at one time there<br/>
was a letterbox there.<br/>
<br/>
bottom line is someone is responsible for this site. a person has cared<br/>
enough about letterboxing to make this site available to us and to recruit<br/>
ones like choi to keep it running. if this person wants to keep every clue<br/>
from the beginning of letterboxing till now and forever on it, then that is<br/>
just fine with me. thank you lbna for being there.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My view is that the placer owns the clues, so if you want to remove them,<br/>
that's up to you. The note on the delete page is just there for people to<br/>
consider, not as any kind of rule. Personally, I don't think there is a big<br/>
problem with leaving clues to retired letterboxes in the database. Abandoned<br/>
clues that don't accurately list their status is much more annoying to me,<br/>
but a very tricky issue to try to address.<br/>
