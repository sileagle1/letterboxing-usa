<br/>
IMHO:<br/>
To be honest, it's very helpful to someone such as myself that is<br/>
moving quite far from my boxes to know that people have found them,<br/>
had troubles, or perhaps that one is missing. Just having seen that<br/>
Maine boxes are so few and somewhat spread out really helps myself and<br/>
others (in this state) to know whether or not to drive 3+ hours just<br/>
to find a box that could be missing...though that is half the fun!   :-)<br/>
<br/>
This certainly may not apply to many other states. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I learned a valuable lesson when I was looking for one of my earliest boxes.<br/>
I drove well out of my way to reach the Golden Spike, in Northern UT.  I<br/>
spent hours that day overturning rocks trying to find an elusive box.  I was<br/>
frustrated because I drove a long way out, and spent forever looking in a<br/>
spot that I felt was a little dangerous.  The compass readings, that I knew<br/>
I had correct took me off trail a bit onto the side of a shale covered hill<br/>
in very slippery terrain.  I ended up searching forever and even narrowly<br/>
avoided stepping on a rattlesnake.  This was all under hot desert sun, and I<br/>
came home with several cuts on my arms.<br/>
<br/>
With some encouragement from A-bear, who had found the box, I went back<br/>
later that month and tried again.  I was horribly embarrassed to realize<br/>
that I, as a newbie, had set my compass correctly, lined up the arrows, and<br/>
followed them in exactly the opposite direction I should have.  I didn't<br/>
line the red up with red.  I found the box in about 10 minutes when I<br/>
returned.<br/>
<br/>
I am now proud to have that stamp in my box.  It is a historic letterbox,<br/>
the first placed in UT, placed by a historic letterboxer (Der Mad Stamper).<br/>
It was also the first box that I found that had any other stamps in it, so I<br/>
was thrilled to read the comments from other letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Had I placed a remark in the database, I would have discouraged anyone else<br/>
from going out to this great spot in US history-actually world history-where<br/>
the first transcontinental railroad ever was joined.  I was lucky that I was<br/>
encouraged on list to keep looking.<br/>
<br/>
I respect Mahjong for his work and effort.  I don't want to start a flame.<br/>
I just have a real problem with people being able to turn off others from<br/>
finding my boxes.  I myself was convinced I was following the clues<br/>
correctly that day in UT.  The wrong direction still lined up with a rock<br/>
that sounded like the one he described in the clue.  If I hear there is a<br/>
problem with my boxes.  I post it or investigate it.  I know that not<br/>
everyone does this, but even though I didn't have success that day at Golden<br/>
Spike.  I still enjoyed all of the history that I learned more about and I<br/>
had an invigorating hike.  It's not just about getting a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
When we have such an everchanging body of letterboxers, I know that things<br/>
will change inevitably.   One of those changes that happens so often is for<br/>
new things to just be accepted as a matter of course gradually.  I worry<br/>
about just saying a database posted on one of the official sites is just a<br/>
matter of choice, when I am sure that it will gradually become accepted as<br/>
the norm and those that don't feel it is fair will be looked down on as not<br/>
participating in all of the full "steps" for finding a box.<br/>
<br/>
I like the system as it is.  It really doesn't take that long to search the<br/>
history of a box in the list archives or to post a new letter asking about a<br/>
box.  I know that not everyone uses the list, but that is a non issue in my<br/>
eyes-if they aren't using a list, they aren't going to be able to get to an<br/>
archive of that list.  With the new system on LBNA, we will gradually be<br/>
able to contact any placer personally too.  This very issue has been a<br/>
matter of debate for a long time and most that have been doing this for a<br/>
while have seemed to have agreed that it wasn't fair to the boxes to take<br/>
away the control of reporting their status.  I would prefer to not have a<br/>
database suddenly placed on an official site without more consensus  from<br/>
the group.  And as for knowledge about the hiking and terrain, if there<br/>
isn't a good description in the clue, you can easily ask the list, check in<br/>
a guide book, or look up the area online.  It is not hard to find out how<br/>
difficult the terrain of an area is.<br/>
<br/>
Well, there's my 2 cents.  I'm finding that I am less and less inclined to<br/>
jump in when a topic turns into debate on this list, but this one I felt was<br/>
important in that it could affect me personally, so I decided to post.  I'm<br/>
not trying to upset anyone, but I feel that there are valid concerns and<br/>
reasons that the webmasters have not put a database such as this up before<br/>
even though someone occassionally requests it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
