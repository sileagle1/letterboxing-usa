The Painted Rocks Box<br/>
<br/>
Warning! this site is an archeological preserve.<br/>
Certain areas are marked no tresspassing please respect them.<br/>
this box will get you as close to the pictograph as you can get legally.<br/>
This box is located near Lake Hodges, North San Diego County.<br/>
<br/>
Take 15 To Rancho Bernardo<br/>
Go West on Bernardo Center Drive<br/>
North on West Bernardo Drive.<br/>
West on Duenda<br/>
6/10 of a mile to trail head on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Take the trail North, Follow the white railing.<br/>
when the railing ends<br/>
it is 84 paces to where the railing begins again<br/>
Keep going. Houses on your left, creek on your right.<br/>
you will soon pass on your left a sign on a gate labeled:<br/>
No Trespassing.<br/>
Look to the north you will see a rock formation that looks<br/>
like a whales mouth. that is where you are headed.<br/>
Keep following along the path.<br/>
At the wooden fence take the path bearing 120 degrees.<br/>
Cross the creek, Then cross the bridge<br/>
Contiue up the rise which overlooks the lake<br/>
at the top of the rise, if you stand next to the keep out sign under the <br/>
telephone wires the split rock is on a bearing of 325 degrees.<br/>
It is the bottom of the split rock which has the pictograph on it.<br/>
<br/>
Keep following the trail<br/>
wind down to the waterfall. From here you can look up to the bottom of the <br/>
split rock, where the pictograph was. It is unfortunately no longer visible. <br/>
But as luck would have it, you are near a letter box that contains the <br/>
pictograph image!!!<br/>
<br/>
Stand with your back to the waterfall (against the railing.)<br/>
go 50 paces down the path (downhill)<br/>
on your right is an outcropping of rock. Just up the hill there is a small <br/>
oak growing out of the outcropping.<br/>
The box is hidden under some rocks just behind the base of the Oak<br/>
<br/>
Please watch for rattle snakes!!!!!! use a stick to reach for the box.<br/>
follow all Letterboxing safety rules!<br/>
<br/>
To exit you can go back the way you came or follow the path down to the <br/>
lake, Even though it goes all the way around, it's a very very very long <br/>
walk. If you just zip in and out to get this box, it takes about 25 minutes <br/>
round trip. Going around the lake would take all day.<br/>
<br/>
History:<br/>
This site was used by Kumeyaay Indians. In the rocks above the waterfall and <br/>
below the split rock is a pool and another small water fall.<br/>
As a kid I used to go swimming there and play among the rocks.<br/>
Twenty years ago the pictograph was still visible, but it is no longer.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the waterfall/letterbox.  We had great weather for our Saturday<br/>
"boxing trip".  It takes us 1 1/4 hrs. to get to the spot from Long Beach,<br/>
but would have never known about the hike  if not for letterboxers like you!<br/>
No one else has stamped in, but we are confident the activity will be<br/>
catching on here in So. Cal.!.  Gwen<br/>

&gt; Piedras Pintadas Cultural Resource Management Plan:<br/>
&gt; The San Dieguito River Park recently completed a protection plan for the<br/>
&gt; significant Native American cultural site south of Lake Hodges known as<br/>
&gt; Piedras Pintadas. As part of the protection plan, appropriate trail access<br/>
&gt; and interpretive signage about Kumeyaay lifestyles was installed. Project<br/>
&gt; funding was $250,000 from a state legislative grant, matched by $250,000<br/>
&gt; from a San Dieguito River Park trust fund at the City of San Diego. Future<br/>
&gt; plans include the construction of a rock art replica. This area is located<br/>
&gt; on the south side of Lake Hodges, west of I-15. Take the West Bernardo<br/>
&gt; Drive/Pomerado Drive exit west, park in dirt parking area signed as the<br/>
&gt; Bernardo Bay Natural Area. Please see the Piedras Pintadas Trail Map. A<br/>
&gt; special fund has also been established to provide for the continued<br/>
&gt; protection of this area. In addition, the Park has published an<br/>
informative<br/>
&gt; book, The Painted Rocks, which is aimed for children in grades 3-6, but is<br/>
&gt; of interest to all ages. Call (619) 235-5445 for more information about<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; book and how you can purchase it.<br/>
