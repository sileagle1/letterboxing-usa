<div>Black Fish and Chick in a Nest </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rated Easy  1 hour +</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sponsored By : Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H Club</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Take rte 195 to Mansfield Center, turn onto Browns Rd next to 
the Congregational church. The trail begins opposite 79&amp;87 Browns rd. There 
is room for 1-2 cars on the edge of the road there.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Enter the Pine woods on a trail put out by the Joshua's trust 
land preservation group. They are saving these beautiful site's from development 
for generations to enjoy. The trail is marked with bright yellow dots on the 
trees.  through the pines where cones have fallen deep to a lane for cows 
long ago. Now only trees go where once a herd was driven safe between the two 
rows of stone . Cross on over .</div>
<div>    Twist and turn through the pines to a pile 
of old firewood long forgotten.  Now down the slope. Over the next wall and 
turn right with the trail. Step over a fallen birch. Go along the wall and down 
another slope toward the bottom of this little ravine. The trail twists around 
to come to a small well built bridge.</div>
<div>   STOP!  When just to step on the bridge turn 
to look behind you. The tree with fingers hides a black fish. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To proceed for the Chick in A Nest cross the bridge, careful 
to keep your feet dry it's wet around here.  Along with the yellow dots 
still up to and along a bit of wall.  You come to the junction of the Holt 
and White dot trails. There are stone piles her spaced 10-12 feet apart . Once 
they held the rails of a farm fence they look like some sort of  Stonhenge 
in our woods.  Now proceed straight on the white dot.</div>
<div> Soon there is a plank crossing of a wet 
area.</div>
<div>Then walk into a mossy clearing and on now with the white 
dots. </div>
<div> Pass through a deep dip in the trail up and out,see the 
abandoned orchard on the right.  Come to a sign it says Bird Loop trail and 
Barrows trail. At the T of the Barrows trail here turn  left</div>
<div>At the second Barows sign take sixteen paces( left foot 
counts)  . Here between wood and stone is a suitable place for a chick in a 
nest to hide. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just a reminder to stamp privately and secure the box as you 
found it so the next people can enjoy this trek too. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The  Barrows trail is part of the SchoolHouse Brook park 
system , you can follow it to Clover mill rd. or  return the way you 
came.   Have Fun! </div></body></html>
