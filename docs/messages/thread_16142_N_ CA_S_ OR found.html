<br/>
#9 Letterbox found on 8/20/03.  My first letterbox.  Great trail!<br/>
<br/>
Phantom Ship found on 8/25/03.  The trail to this letterbox provided me with my first-ever glimpse of Crater Lake, which is indescribably beautiful.<br/>
Picked up the Coastal Conch Hitchhiker in the Phantom Ship box.  I did contact the placer directly regarding this.  Excellently carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Tried to find Mt. Mazama's Treasure but the trail was very busy and it was hard to search for the box discreetly and we weren't 100% sure on the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Skunk Cabbage found on 8/31/03.  I had never been on this part of the Coastal Trail before.  I dragged my husband out late one evening on our way back home from a softball tournament.  Your clues are right on and we had just enough time to make it back to the truck before it got dark.  <br/>
<br/>
1/2 Redwood found on 9/1/03.  This is a bonus stamp for driving all the way to Ryan's Bomb's Away letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
Bomb's Away found on 9/1/03.  A very long drive on a gravel road to an interesting history site.  I had actually been here once before to hide a geocache (nowhere near the letterbox) but didn't know about letterboxing at the time so I had to make the drive once again to get these two stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Super Sewer found on 9/6/03.  Really neat place for bird watching.  <br/>
<br/>
Oasis found on 9/6/03.  Beautiful park.  I have to admit I didn't follow the clues to get to this one since I am familiar with the park.  <br/>
<br/>
Rainie Falls found on 9/12/03.  Very nice hike to a beautiful spot.  There were a lot of people fishing as the salmon are running at this time.  There is a geocache hidden directly up the hill from this letterbox and a few geocachers have found it and written notes in the book.  P.S.  I don't think your stamp sucks.<br/>
<br/>
Big Pine found on 9/20/03.  Wasn't expecting the twist to this one-very fun!  I thought the stamp was missing at first.<br/>
<br/>
Burnt Turkey found on 9/20/03.  Cute stamp!  Enjoyed the hike past the falls but didn't take the whole loop as suggested as I was worn out from a day of geocaching and letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Old Highway 101 found on 9/26/03.  Celebrated my birthday by letterboxing and geocaching.  Had to try for this one even though it was getting late and I was going to be late for my own birthday dinner, but after not finding Ryan's Cape Blanco box I had to end the day on a good note.    <br/>
<br/>
Didn't find the Cape Blanco letterbox on 9/26/03.  Found the right trail but nothing that fit the clues.  Will have to go back and try again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who placed these boxes!  I'm sorry you didn't get my messages directly.  <br/>
