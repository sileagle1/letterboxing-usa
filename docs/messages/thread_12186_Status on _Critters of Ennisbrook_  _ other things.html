Scoobie Snacks is a double stamp: you ink one side and stamp it, then <br/>

This sweet little letterboxer has been sick for two weeks now and isn't even seeing the out doors let alone finding all those wonderful boxes.... I guess I should thank all the Googled members that are doing it for me... at least I know I have lots of places to go when I get better.<br/>
<br/>
It has been nice to read Ryan's adventures... I'm still working on some devilish scheme to pay him back for the last adventure he sent me on.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone is having bright happy letter boxing days... <br/>
