<h1><u>Christmas 
Eve Letterbox on Flatbrook</u></h1>
<p> <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = 
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></p>
<h2>Shenipsit 
Trail, East Glastonbury, Connecticut</h2>
<p>Hiking distance to letterbox approximately 0.6 
miles (45 min one way, enjoying the hike, relatively easy).</p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>This letterbox was placed in its location along the 
Shenipsit Trail on Christmas Eve, 2002.<span>  
</span>This section of the Shenipsit Trail follows flatbrook from near Diamond 
Lake into the Meshomaisic State Forest.<span>  
</span>You will cross 2 very small unnamed brooks which feed Flatbrook on its 
way to the Blackledge River.<span>  </span>You 
will cross another beautiful small brook at the site of the letterbox, where 
there is small waterfall.<span>  </span>All the 
brooks have many stepping stones so even young children (6 and up recommended) 
can enjoy this walk.<span>  </span>It is 0.6 
miles from the starting point to the letterbox, and the path gets a little steep 
in a few places.<span>  </span>There are some 
forks as well but the Shenipsit trail is well marked. 
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Precautions<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In summertime (June  Aug) these woods of Connecticut 
host the endangered Timber Rattlesnake.<span>  
</span>These are generally docile and shy creatures but you should watch the 
path. A few have been spotted over the years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Although the trails are well marked once in the State 
Forest it is pretty isolated.<span>  </span>A 
compass, cell phone, water bottle and a walking stick are 
advised.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The Trail<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Take Route 94 (Hebron Avenue) east from Glastonbury, past 
route 83 (Manchester Road), and keep going east until you reach the top of 
John-Tom Hill at Marlborough Road.<span>  
</span>At Marlborough take a right and proceed past the first stop sign (Diamond 
Lake Road) to Imperial Drive (3<sup>nd</sup> Right after turning onto 
Marlborough) and make a right turn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Proceed down Imperial past the first left (Empress Lane) 
until you reach the first guardrail on the left.<span>  </span>This will be 0.3 miles from Marlborough 
Road.<span>  </span>Park the car on the right 
side of the road and cross the street.<span>  
</span>Look for a large rock with 2 blue blazes painted on it.<span>  </span>The rock is between the first and 2nd 
guardrails on the left side of Imperial.<span>  
</span>The blue blazes mark the Shenipsit Trail and you will follow these 
markings almost to the letterbox.<span>  
</span>The trail is visible by the trampled grass to the right of the 
stone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Walk down the path.<span>  
</span>You will hear Flatbrook gurgling on you left.<span>  </span>As you go around a small drainage pond 
(which is usually empty) you will enter some woods.<span>  </span>Note the blue blazes marked on the 
trees.<span>   </span>As you enter the woods 
here you will cross your first very small brook feeding Flatbrook.<span>  </span>This small one originates from Diamond 
Lake and is highly dependent on rainfall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Continue along the main trail, SSE as it passes behind 
some homes in the subdivision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>At the pipeline clearing Flatbrook displays a few small 
rapids.<span>  </span>The trail veers hard to the 
left and follows just alongside the brook again. Continue following the 
blue-blazed trail, which eventually goes up the right bank, still following 
Flatbrook, from high on the hillside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>At 0.37 miles from the start you will enter a sizable 
grove of Mountain Laurels.<span>  </span>These 
are beautiful the first week of June.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>100 feet beyond the end of the grove you will cross the 
second small brook (easy).<span>  </span>This one 
is cool and noisy for a few days after a hard rain.<span>  </span>At this point you will be 0.45 miles 
from the start of the path.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>100 feet after this brook the path comes to a fork.<span>  </span>Bear Left, continuing roughly South, and 
following the blue blazes on the trees.<span>  
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>At 0.54 miles the path comes to a T, at a tree with 2 
blue blazes on it.<span>  </span>Bearing right 
follows the blue blazes, bearing left takes you along a short, unmarked trail 
down to Flatbrook and a waterfall, which you might be able to hear from 
here.<span>  </span>Follow the trail to the left 
(SSE) to the creek.<span>  </span>As you approach 
you will dodge a vary large, fallen pine tree.<span>  </span>As you pass this bear right along 
Flatbrook and you will see the waterfall.<span>  
</span>Across the creek here is a small clearing used by hikers during the 
summer.<span>  </span>You are now in the 
Meshomasic State Forest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The Letterbox<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Stand at the point where a fallen tree lay (near the 
referenced pine tree), roots exposed, at the bank of the small waterfall 
stream.<span>  </span>At this point the waterfall 
is on your right, Flatbrook is on your left, and the stream coming down the 
waterfall is in front of you.<span>  </span>Look 
up the waterfall on the opposite bank to a tree, which is bent, and looks to 
have two small rooty holes exposed.<span>  
</span>Cross the small stream and hike up the bank to this tree.<span>  </span>The lower right hand hole, facing 
Flatbrook, holds the prize.<span>  </span>At the 
box, as you face Flatbrook, your about 1/3 up the waterfall (which is now on 
your left 8 feet), and 25-30 feet from Flatbrook (the main 
stream).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The Return Trip<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>As you retrace your steps back bear right at your first 
main fork.<span>  </span>Remember, you are 
following Flatbrook back.<span>  </span>Shortly 
after this main fork there is a smaller fork, right, which takes you right down 
to the water.<span>  </span>Its a nice spot but 
the main trail is to the left at the small fork.<span>  </span>You will notice the blue blazes on the 
way back just as you saw them coming in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Have Fun, Good Luck</span></p>
