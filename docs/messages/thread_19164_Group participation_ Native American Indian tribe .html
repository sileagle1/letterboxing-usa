  First thanks for all the responses from everyone. Most have been <br/>
asking questions. Hope this helps a bit.<br/>
  The series is open to any Native American Indian tribe of North <br/>
America. I am hoping for representative stamps from various tribes <br/>
around the country. There will likely be a bonus stamp for those that <br/>
complete the entire series. <br/>
   Those that submit stamps for this series will receive index cards <br/>
with the imprints of all the stamps of the series as exchanges. The <br/>
option is to decline this if you are able to search for the stamps.<br/>
   All carvers will be given credit on the clues for each stamp.<br/>
   Stamps are not due until August 27th. Remember to contact me off <br/>
list with questions.<br/>
   I am looking forward to this series. Thanks to all in advance who <br/>
help make this possible. Safe trails!<br/>
