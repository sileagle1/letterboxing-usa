Princess Lea's 2 great boxes. Very doable and nice stamps. Since we grew up in <br/>
this area, you'd think we'd have gotten to know the fabulous treasure that is <br/>
Tilden Park pretty well. But you know how it is when you grow up somewhere: <br/>
you need to come back as a tourist (or a letterboxer!) to find the really great <br/>
places. <br/>

Chalk up another beautiful venue found because of the generous letterboxers <br/>
willing to share their favorite places with us all!<br/>
