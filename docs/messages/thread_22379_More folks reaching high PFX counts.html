Just wanted to note a few other folks we've heard from recently hitting their <br/>
new PFX milestones:  Lightnin' Bug of PA reached PFX500 on June 19 and <br/>
has been quite busy lately planting boxes and solving mapsurfer mysteries, <br/>
Bird Stamper of CT reached F500 on July 16 and tells us he is working on <br/>
some new plants;  Patrick and Amy of CT reached PFX1000 on May 2 and <br/>
that must have been quite a challenge with their new baby, Thomas, who just <br/>
has his first birthday a couple of weeks ago!  (Imagine what kind of PFX count <br/>
Thomas could have, starting out so young, if he keeps it up - and we've <br/>
already seen him out letterboxing, too!)  Then, Wisconsin Hiker and Martini <br/>
Man reported having already reached PFX1000 on July 4 with letterboxing <br/>
trips planned for this summer from the east coast to the west coast and in <br/>
between!  Finally, we heard that that quiet, but extremely active CT couple, <br/>
Sadie and Russ, reached F2500 way back in January and have most likely <br/>
already passed F3000 by now!  We hope those good folks and many others <br/>
keep up their high levels of enjoyment and achievement in this fun little hobby <br/>
that is so much benefited by their hard work and dedication!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
