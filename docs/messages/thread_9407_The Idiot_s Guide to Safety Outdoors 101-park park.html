                    <div class="plaintext-content">the last time i was out at seashore state park after<br/>
hours, it was because the other couple had locked<br/>
their keys in their vehicle. the rangers we kind<br/>
enough to not only NOT lock us in, but radio for a<br/>
locksmith to rectify the situation. they were quite<br/>
concerned as to why we were hanging out in the parking<br/>
lot at quarter-to-nine.....<br/>
hope they are as helpful everywhere else...<br/>
but at any rate, cell phones have become cheaper since<br/>
then and we probably could have called the locksmith<br/>
ourselves if it had been more recent.<br/>

<div>A couple of years ago, Dan and I were out hiking at Devil's Hopyard in 
CT.  We tried to squeeze the hike in after work, but it got dark 
fast!  Despite our quick hiking speed, we didn't manage to get to our car 
until well after sunset.  As we made our way to the parking lot, the ranger 
met us part way out.  I guess he was trying to find us, but he just yelled 
to us that it was past sunset.  We replied that we were sorry and trying to 
get out as quickly as we could.  He didn't really respond, just turned and 
walked out, but at least he didn't lock us in!</div>
