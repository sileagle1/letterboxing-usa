                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've been looking for good candidates to use for mini- and micro boxes and I <br/>
think we found a couple that are going to work well. The first we found at <br/>
Wal-Mart. It's Rubbermaid's Servin'Sealer #14 which comes 3 to a package for <br/>
$2.00. They're less than 4" square and 2 1/4" tall, big enough for a decent sized <br/>
stamp, homemade log book and one of those 1" stamp pads. A pen is out of the <br/>
question but a golf pencil works well. <br/>
<br/>
For the micro box, go to the baking aisle of your favorite supermarket and <br/>
buy one of Schilling's 1 ounce seasonings. I found the Chili Powder at $1.29 to <br/>
be the cheapest spice (and essential for Tamale pie!) Empty the spice into <br/>
another receptacle and soak the Schilling label off and you have a box larger <br/>
than a film canister but smaller than anything else I've seen. The screw-on red <br/>
top is going to work great, for most weather conditions I think.<br/>
<br/>
Another cool thing we figured out: We wanted to place one of the mini boxes <br/>
mentioned above on a chain-link fence underneath some heavy vines and wanted it <br/>
to hang from the fence. We used silver duct tape to cover the body of the box <br/>
then covered the top of the box separately with the tape. We doubled up on <br/>
the tape in one of the corners of the box making sure it was sticking out over <br/>
the edge of the box. We poked a piece of heavy wire (coat hanger) through this <br/>
extra piece, shaped it into a hook and were able to hang it nicely on the <br/>
fence.<br/>
<br/>
Although east coast people might find other results, we'll keep an eye on <br/>
these boxes and let you know how they survive California's weather conditions. <br/>
