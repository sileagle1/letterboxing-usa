<br/>
You can probably find 90% of all the letterboxes in Central America <br/>
on my website at http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, they're all alive and well, but they have never <br/>
been visited.  There was one box in Costa Rica (check the old site) <br/>
that wasn't planted by Amanda or myself and I don't know much about.<br/>
<br/>
Outside of that, I don't know about any other boxes in Central <br/>
America.<br/>
<br/>
I've never heard of anyone planting a box anywhere in South America, <br/>
so if you do so yourself, you might be able to claim "first placer" <br/>
for an entire continent!  Exciting, I know!  =)<br/>
