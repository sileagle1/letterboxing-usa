For those of you who worry about a geocacher exchanging your stamp for a trinket I recommend that you put a eye-catching short note in your letterbox (perhaps a florescent pink laminated card that says "Please leave the stamp in the box. Do not trade." You might even want to write it on the back of the stamp with permanent ink. <br/>

The whole box and contents are gone, and the stone that was providing cover on one side was a few feet away. The park is usually pretty quiet, and the box (when properly hidden) was not obvious. I think it was either found by muggles, or not re-hidden properly by the last finder. Unfortunately, no one ever logged the find on LBNA or on AQ.. Sorry anyone jumped to the conclusion that 'cachers were to blame cause I have no reason to blame them for taking an entire box with contents. When I re-carve my stamp and re-plant, I'll go a little deeper into the woods.<br/>

Nobody can actually "pin" anything on a geocacher anyway unless they<br/>
actually see them in action.<br/>
<br/>
I always tape a note to the underneath of the lid in my boxes stating that<br/>
it's a letterbox, not a geocache.  Tho if I start to notice geocachers have<br/>
signed in to one of my logbook fairly often, I'll move the box since they<br/>
can use up a logbook pretty quickly sometimes.<br/>

Is that what happened Captain Tripps? Did someone exchange the stamp for a<br/>
trinket? The way I interpreted CT's message is that the whole box was gone.<br/>

For those of you who worry about a geocacher exchanging your stamp for a<br/>
trinket I recommend that you put a eye-catching short note in your letterbox<br/>
(perhaps a florescent pink laminated card that says "Please leave the stamp<br/>

 I went out to do a check on my first ever plant..  Only to find it<br/>
 MISSING!  Can't tell you how much that stings.  Had my first "official"<br/>
 hand carved stamp inside too.  Funny thing is, a black bra was left in<br/>
 the same spot.  Hmmm...  A calling card of a serial box-napper?<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, thanx to anyone who stamped it before it went AWOL.  I hope to<br/>
 replace it soon - further away from the eyes of muggles.<br/>
<br/>
 Peace &amp; Kittens to ya..<br/>
