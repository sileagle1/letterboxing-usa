I've fixed some bugs with handling box status. Here is how it should work.<br/>
1) You can prevent other members from viewing anything other than<br/>
their own last status when viewing your boxes as a preference in<br/>
Member Services.<br/>
2) You can set your status on any box at any time. The choices for<br/>
your own boxes are different than on other members boxes. The green<br/>
flag to change the status shows up in the list of boxes if the clues<br/>
for a box are outside LbNA, otherwise the flag shows up when viewing<br/>
the box details.<br/>
3) You can always view your list of found and attempted boxes from<br/>
Member Services.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to make some extensions when I have time.<br/>
1) Allow the box owner to see the status that everyone has put on one<br/>
of  their box.<br/>
2) Show a status marker in the list for your found or attempted boxes.<br/>
3) Add a preference to hide boxes that you've found from your list.<br/>
4) Add a preference to receive an e-mail notice each time someone sets<br/>
the status on one of your boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience testing out this new feature.<br/>
