box was in great shape, dry etc.  However, the stamp is almost broken <br/>
in two.  It's still stampable- we got good images, however it's on <br/>
it's last legs.  Loved the waterfalls and the views: DrewClan always <br/>
knows how to pick them!  Word of warning though, if you are planning <br/>
to do this box, plan on getting muddy.  The path is apparently a <br/>
seasonal stream when the snow finally melts.  Still a great walk, <br/>
just a little wet and muddy.<br/>
