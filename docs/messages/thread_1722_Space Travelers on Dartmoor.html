                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello All  -<br/>
    A few weeks ago, we traveled to the "Mecca" of letterboxing,<br/>
Dartmoor, England. It was the first time in that country for us, and the<br/>
trip was awesome. For the past few months we have been<br/>
corresponding with Graham Howard (aka "The Moorland Wizard") who was<br/>
incredibly helpful in suggesting lodgings, proper maps, and helped<br/>
secure the letterbox catalogue for us as well as some lists of<br/>
uncatalogued boxes.<br/>
    This Autumn was one of the wettest on record in England. There had<br/>
been 100 days of rainy weather which stopped on the day that we arrived.<br/>
(I think it had something to do with our having spent far too much money<br/>
on good rain gear). Driving in the mirror image of all of our previous<br/>
experience was a bit unnerving, especially after being awake all night<br/>
on the plane. We stayed on a farm near the town of Ashburton, which was<br/>
situated off the side of a 10 ft wide side road that had 12 ft hedges<br/>
along either edge. I felt like I was traveling through a labyrinth, and<br/>
a huge monster truck might come barreling in my direction at any moment.<br/>
<br/>
 We arrived at our chosen search area, to find two gentlemen getting<br/>
ready to walk the moor as we got out of our car. I asked them if they<br/>
were letterboxers. They replied that they were and we set about<br/>
exchanging stamps. These guys had fancy wooden boxes in which they kept<br/>
their stamps. They each had a personal stamp, a stamp for their dog, a<br/>
stamp for their wife, and a stamp for themselves as letterboxing<br/>
buddies. In addition, there were a few miscellaneous stamps. I felt<br/>
pretty deficient as I only had two to give them in exchange. I know that<br/>
they were very pleased to collect a print of our stamp. They gave us a<br/>
bit of advice, and then were off on their own search.<br/>
 Even though it wasnt raining, it certainly was foggy and windy,<br/>
creating a very eerie atmosphere. As it turns out, most of the clues<br/>
depended taking a sighting of a landmark at some distance away. Arrrgh!<br/>
We had to guess where the landmarks were from the map, and our relative<br/>
position. Visibility was about 40 feet! Even so, we actually found three<br/>
boxes in spite of the fog. It helped that the area we chose to search<br/>
had dozens of boxes per sq kilometer!<br/>
 Of course I couldnt leave Dartmoor without hiding a box of my own.<br/>
Placed on the Winter Solstice, shes the Goddess at Grimspound, and is<br/>
located near the remains of this ancient settlement in the heart of the<br/>
moorland. She can be found 70 paces from the Southeast gate, bearing 150<br/>
degrees, under a rocky nose just above a large flat stone. It was one of<br/>
the oldest places Id ever visited. Surely those who once lived there<br/>
would have worshiped one like her.<br/>
 In addition to all the boxes on the Moor, there were boxes to be had in<br/>
many of the Pubs, shops, and even one in the Princetown garage. I carved<br/>
a special stamp for the occasion of our trip, and folks were pretty<br/>
curious about the Americans mucking about looking for the boxes. The<br/>
other interesting thing was that there were a number of people from<br/>
Dartmoor who didnt know about letterboxing.<br/>
 It was a pity that we only had about two days to devote to finding<br/>
boxes, but this only whetted my appetite to return and look for more.<br/>

These country lanes didn't even have the status of "B" roads.

they've really got the letterboxing thing down to a fine science...of course<br/>
they've had plenty of time to perfect the hobby.  I'm glad you had a good<br/>
time tramping the moors!<br/>
