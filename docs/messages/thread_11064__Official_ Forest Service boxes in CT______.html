I sent the message below to the Yahoo listserve for letterboxing.  My <br/>
question - is this the way to get the reference letterbox clues on <br/>
the LbNA web site?  I am assuming that, in sending it to the <br/>
listserve, I both reach the interested audience directly and also <br/>
reach you guys, and that you then excerpt the information from the <br/>
listserve and put it in the website.  Is this the way the system <br/>
works?  Please advise me if sending to the listserve is the preferred <br/>
way of getting listed on your site, or if I should be doing something <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ~ by the way, we do link to your site from ours.<br/>

Hello:<br/>
<br/>
I am Chris Donnelly, and I work for the State of Connecticut <br/>
Department of Environmental Protection Division of Forestry (CT DEP <br/>
Forestry).  CT DEP Forestry is very excited to announce that, as part <br/>
of the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the first State Forest <br/>
in Connecticut (also, first in New England and second in the <br/>
country), we have committed ourselves to the creation of a letterbox <br/>
in each of the 30 State Forests in Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
We are also very pleased to let people know that the first five <br/>
letterboxes have been placed, and the clues written.  The first five <br/>
letterboxes are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Meshomasic State Forest Letterbox, in Portland, CT (Middlesex <br/>
County), placed March 1 or thereabouts.  clues: <br/>
http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/meshomasic.htm<br/>
<br/>
Tunxis State Forest Letterbox, in East Hartland, CT (Hartford <br/>
County), placed March 1st.  clues: <br/>
http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/tunxis.htm<br/>
<br/>
Cockaponset State Forest Letterbox, in Chester, CT (Middlesex <br/>
County), placed March 1 or thereabouts.  Clues:<br/>
http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/cockaponset.htm<br/>
<br/>
Pachaug State Forest Letterbox, in Voluntown, CT (New London County), <br/>
placed March 1 or so.  clues: <br/>
http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/pachaug.htm<br/>
<br/>
Nassahegon State Forest Letterbox, in Burlington, CT (Hartford <br/>
County), placed March 1, more or less.  Clues:<br/>
http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/nassahegon.htm<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the five clues pages, there is a general State Forest <br/>
letterbox page we are encouraging people to make use of, at:<br/>
http://dep.state.ct.us/burnatr/forestry/centen/letterbox.htm<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned, ultimately we hope to have some 30 letterboxes, one <br/>
on each of the state forests, in place by the end of this year.<br/>
<br/>
Also by the way, I will be primarily responsible for the web end of <br/>
the assignment (others are doing the actual placement of the boxes).  <br/>
Normally, I would be writing from my work address <br/>
(chris.donnelly@p...), but, after all of the effort and enthusiasm <br/>
that went into this project, I didn't want to delay, even for a day, <br/>
letting folks know that these boxes are out there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and thanks for your role in making this happen.<br/>
<br/>
Chris Donnelly <br/>
