<p>Ye Olde Cemetery</p></b><b>
<p>Placed: 4-27-02</p></b><b>
</b><p>Placed By: Chuck Straub and Molly</p>
<p>Location: Mansfield Center Connecticut, Tolland 
County</p>
<p>Rated: Easy</p><b>
</b><p>This box is part of a series of letterboxes being planted in 
honor of Mansfields 300<sup>th</sup> Anniversary, 1702  2002.</p>
<p>This cemetery is the oldest cemetery in Tolland County and dates 
back to 1693. The cemetery is from the time of Mansfields origin.</p>
<p>Coming from Willimantic, traveling north towards Mansfield 
Center, just after passing Mansfield Hollow Restaurant you will see the 
Mansfield Center Olde Cemetery on the right. You can park just off the road or 
down Cemetery road on the right. As you enter the cemetery from the route 195 
side at the opening of the stone wall next to the huge oak tree, go 100 degrees 
to a grave stone which looks like a large table. From there, go 135 degrees to a 
tree that is almost touching a stone wall with a rotted tree stump behind it. 
The letterbox is planted under some sticks, wood and leaves between the tree and 
stump.</p></div></body></html>
