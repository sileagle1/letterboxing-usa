                    <html><body>the weather was beautiful here in Amelia so I decided to try to find a few boxes today.   Found the following boxes:   Zoo Box, East fork Dam box, Nine Eleven, and bushwacker.   All boxes are in great shape and I replaced as found.   Also Found the ohio flamingo hitchhiker and she's already had quite the journey.   Ended up lost in action for a few hours due to the fact that she fell out of my fanny pack.   Went back when I realized she was gone (had already gone home and then freaked) and thankfully she hadn't flown off with any non letterboxers. LOL.   She will soon be on her way as soon as I find a box big enough.   Hope everyone else is enjoying their weekends<br/>
