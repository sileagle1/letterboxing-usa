It seems a lot of people don't know it, but the US mainland was <br/>
actually bombed several times by the Japanese during WWII, and I hid <br/>
this letterbox at the site of the first bombing.  Everyone who knows <br/>
me knows I'm a huge William Sullivan fan, but the account he writes <br/>
about this episode in "Hiking Oregon's History" had me laughing out <br/>
loud at the absurdity of fighter planes looking for submarines around <br/>
Bend, Oregon (about 150 miles inland!), and FBI agents hiking remote <br/>
Oregon lakes for nonexistant, secret Japanese air bases.  Of all the <br/>
fascinating stories in this book, not only is this one my favorite, <br/>
but it alone is worth the price of the book!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
