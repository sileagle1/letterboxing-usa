Clear Lake is home to one of the nations largest boat harbors.   It <br/>
also is home to NASA's Johnson Space Center and Space Center <br/>
Houston.   Nearby are the new Kemah waterfront, with restaurants and <br/>
entertainment, and the Armand Bayou Nature Center.  Clear Lake was <br/>
annexed by Houston about 10 years ago, but retains much of its <br/>
independence.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Clear Lake Sailing" letterbox is located in Clear Lake Park, on <br/>
Clear Lake.  From Houston, go southeast on I-45 to Nasa Road 1.  Turn <br/>
left on Nasa Road 1 and go about 4.5 miles, past the Johnson Space <br/>
Center, turning left at a traffic light into Clear Lake Park.  Drive <br/>
to the back of the park, and park your car at the "Bay Area Museum".<br/>
