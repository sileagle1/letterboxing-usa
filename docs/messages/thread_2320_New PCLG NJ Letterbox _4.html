Box #4: Into The Woods<br/>
Location: Pattenburg, Hunterdon County, New Jersey<br/>
Placed 04/26/2001<br/>
Clue page: http://members.aol.com/pcletterboxing/clue4.htm<br/>
<br/>
CAUTION: These woods are used for hunting from September <br/>
through January, so either 1) wear blaze orange, or 2) stay out of <br/>
there during hunting season! If you have any questions <br/>
regarding the park, call the Hunterdown County Park Office at <br/>
908-782-1158.<br/>
<br/>
The entrance to Hoffman Park is located off Baptist Church Road <br/>
in Pattenburg, NJ.<br/>
<br/>
Starting at the parking lot within Hoffman Park, walk down the <br/>
hill. From the southwest corner of Lake Manny, take the road that <br/>
heads to the east.<br/>
<br/>
You'll come to a junction of two roads: a paved road continues to <br/>
the left, and a dirt road goes straight ahead. Take the road that <br/>
heads at 96 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Continue along this road, then go 60 paces past the pond on <br/>
your left (if the road curves to the left, you've gone too far). To your <br/>
left you'll see a downed tree and, further in the woods, you'll see <br/>
a hunter's tree stand.<br/>
