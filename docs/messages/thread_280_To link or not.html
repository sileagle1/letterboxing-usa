&gt; &gt;  Furthermore, I hate Geocities.  They let people have<br/>
&gt; &gt;  free web pages, but the<br/>
&gt; &gt;  utility they provide to help them author <br/>
&gt; &gt;  their pages always sticks the code in<br/>
&gt; &gt;  that makes the advertisement pop up.  Yuck!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; sorta like this?<br/>

Just to clarify, it's not the advertisements themselves that I resent...<br/>
it's the stupid pop-up windows.  They DOUBLE the load time of EACH page and<br/>
then require me to go up and click on them to make them go away.  MUCH more<br/>
annoying than the tiny 3 to 5 line advertising blurb that gets tacked onto<br/>
the messages of our free talk list.  I recommend that anyone who has<br/>
webpages on Geocities do what Marty has suggested to make the annoying<br/>
pop-ups go away.<br/>
<br/>
As for the particular link that started this whole discussion, I think we<br/>
should give this guy the benefit of the doubt by having Dan or someone<br/>
contact him and ask him to:<br/>
<br/>
(1)  Get rid of the annoying pop-up ads.<br/>
<br/>
(2)  More importantly, delete all clues to Word of Mouth Dartmoor Clues.<br/>
<br/>
Until he meets these requirements, we should not support him.  If he refuses<br/>
to meet the second requirement, we should FLAME him!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>
