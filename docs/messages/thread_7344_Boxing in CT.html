today.  We found the Thames River Light Series safe and dry, as well <br/>
as the Avery Light box.  Then we headed down the road a piece and <br/>
found the Haley Farm Series, Haley Farm State Park, and Canopy Rock, <br/>
again all dry and intact.  We got some beautiful new stamps for our <br/>
books and wore out Ruth, who is currently flopped on the floor and <br/>
looking pathetic as only labs can.  Hopefully the rain will hold off <br/>
some so we can get some boxes tomorrow too!<br/>

<br/>I was also ecstatic to find the compass fugit hitchhiker at the George Washington Letterbox!!!!!  This hitchhiker was carved by none other than legerdemaine!  What an honor to find a legerdemaine hitchhiker out on the trail!  I had only encountered two other legerdemaine boxes (Flutterby and the KMartha Hitchhiker), and those were at the mystery gathering.  What a great find!
<br/>
<br/>So who knows where I will plant this hitchhiker?????  I guess you'll all have to go out boxing to find out?  (I still have it,  haven't planted it yet!!!)  I also found the Sharp Dressed Man in Hartford today (too bad he's not real... sigh....) intact and ready for the next visitor.  It's amazing that it is still there, since this is of course, Hartford!
<br/>
<br/>Anyway.... get out boxing folks!!!!!!  It's great weather!

once went to find it about 4 months ago with 2 friends<br/>
and their large friendly drooling St. Bernard.  When<br/>
we got near the site, we became aware of some very<br/>
suspicious characters near by.  We decided to move on<br/>

bronchitis- but couldn't resist the great weather to get in a little <br/>
boxing.  We found the Jordan Mill box and WOW!  We also found several <br/>
mystery boxes- Anniversary Surprise, Butterfly (birthday box placed <br/>
by MusicWoman), and Wedding Rock all in good order.  We also picked <br/>
up a bonus box.  And we FINALLY replaced the 1st box in the Indian <br/>
and the Water Fountain Series.  All in all, not too bad for 2 sickies!<br/>
Clues to be posted ASAP.  Thanks to all the planters!<br/>
