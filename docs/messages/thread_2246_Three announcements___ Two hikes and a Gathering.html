(Sorry for the short notice on the last one... Chris (Fur)<br/>
has hounded me to post for two weeks now, and I just kept<br/>
forgetting.  Mea Culpa...  - Ben)<br/>

We have planted a single in southwestern Massachusetts, the<br/>
"Craggy Knoll Letterbox".<br/>
<br/>
If possible you should try to do this box within the next<br/>
two weeks. The wild flowers will blow you away. It is<br/>
worth the drive.<br/>
<br/>
You can find the clue at:<br/>

RIBNAG has planted a new set of boxes, the "Family and<br/>
Friends" series, in a style similar to the DrewClan's<br/>
"Sound View" series (Hopefully Jay will forgive us).<br/>
The clue resides at:<br/>
<br/>
http://users.tmok.com/~ribnag/lb-famfr.shtml<br/>
<br/>
This series, a not-too-difficult-to-find mystery box<br/>
somewhere in Rhode Island, currently has two boxes, but<br/>
will grow over time, so check the page for an up-to-date<br/>
box count every now and again.<br/>
<br/>
A note to our "beta testers"... The clue has changed a<br/>
bit, though the keystone box has not, so if you want to<br/>
check it out just as a puzzle, feel free to take a peek.<br/>

The members of RIBNAG wish to invite those letterboxers nearby<br/>
to come to a small gathering in Western Coventry RI.  On Saturday<br/>
28 APR 2001 we will have an event stamp and a short hike for you<br/>
to do on the shore of Johnson's Pond in Coventry.  Come to 802<br/>
Town Farm Rd (off 117) anytime between 4pm and sunset.  We plan<br/>
on having a pot-luck dinner about 7ish so feel free to bring<br/>
something and have a meal with us.  Bring your journals and<br/>
stamps, for this is a great chance to get some X values!<br/>
<br/>
Also, a new RIBNAG stamp will be annouced at this small gathering.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, directions etc... feel free to email<br/>
us at ribnag@users.tmok.com<br/>
<br/>
We all hope to see you!<br/>
