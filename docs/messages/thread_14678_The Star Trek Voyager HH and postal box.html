to get there hands on Jay Drew's Star Trek Voyager.<br/>
<br/>
This HH was sent to me in the postal box(the letterbox that is mailed <br/>
from one mailbox to another mailbox). It is a HH, and it does NOT <br/>
have to stay in the postal box. I have great plans for the HH and it <br/>
will be an easy find. If you are a Star Trek fan and you just have to <br/>
have this stamp then I would advise you to make plans on being the <br/>
first person to find the "You've Got Mail" letterbox, otherwise happy <br/>
hunting.<br/>
