I think you are referring to what we call Bannana Spiders where I <br/>
grew up in Florida. We do grow them BIG down here. I _strongly_ <br/>
suggest that anyone who decides to go into the woods (particularly <br/>
wetlands) off well marked trails down here carry a spider stick. Any <br/>
stick will do and you just wave it in front of you like a magic wand <br/>
to pull down any spider webs before you walk into them. I can tell <br/>
you from  experiences it is no fun to get tangled in one of those <br/>
webs with a spider as big as your hand who is not very happy. The <br/>
bright side is I don't believe they are poisonous, just scary.<br/>

<br/>
I looked up two of the three spiders I encountered on the net, one was <br/>
the golden silk spider (very pretty) another was the yellow &amp; black <br/>
agriope (I'm on memory, sorry if its spelled wrong). We the yellow &amp; <br/>
black ones in CT but not as large. The third which I could not <br/>
identify was a fuzzy gray with red. I photographed them all.<br/>
<br/>
We had taken a hitchhiker down with us to leave there, but we ended up <br/>
bringing it back home. As a consolation, I color-copied my pictures, <br/>
cropped them and taped them into the hitchhiker's log book, before <br/>
leaving it at a Rhode Island letterbox. Oh well, best of intentions.<br/>
<br/>
Yours,<br/>
