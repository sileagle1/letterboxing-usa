Erwinna, Bucks Co.,PA.<br/>
Planted Nov. 25th 2001<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Route 32. A few miles south of the Frenchtown Bridge. Right turn <br/>
into the park, drive as far back as you can to the Canal and park in the <br/>
lot. There is a Disc Golf Course located here! Bring your disc!!<br/>
<br/>
Type: Easy- bring your bike or hike.<br/>
Terrain: Flat tow path.<br/>
<br/>
"Floating Feather"<br/>
<br/>
Head south. Past Erwinna, and then past the not so "Golden Pheasant".  While <br/>
you go under, the traffic goes over.<br/>
Past the BSA, "Cradle Of Liberty,(what's that about?) beside the Delaware <br/>
River.<br/>
Continue on to where the canal goes over the "Tinicum Creek".<br/>
(Some places are for your eyes, some are for your ears...)<br/>
When you find the "sluice",(way cool!) locate the south bridge.<br/>
Lay on your belly there. Yep! That's what I said. The "place" doesn't look <br/>
that great until you get on your belly, look down into the water and <br/>
listen........oh, fill my ears and feed my soul.....<br/>
Now, down to business. Walk to the bottom of the northern stairs. Make a <br/>
sharp right,(you can go to the river later!), carefully go to the base of <br/>
the curved stone wall. Almost in the middle..where the base of the wall <br/>
meets the ground. Nestled under a long "greenish" rock and behind some bark <br/>
and leaning stone...<br/>
Careful! The creek is right below you. No real danger, but do not send your <br/>
child or your grandmother for this box!!!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Life!! 'Box On!!<br/>
