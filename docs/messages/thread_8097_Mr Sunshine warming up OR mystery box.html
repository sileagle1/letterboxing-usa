Mystery Letterbox in cloudy, rainy Portland, Oregon today.  We will <br/>
soon send him North to the sunny shores of Puget Sound!  <br/>
<br/>
Rainy Day Note:  Can you believe after 95 letterboxes in the Pacific <br/>
Northwest that today was THE VERY FIRST TIME IT RAINED ON US!!!  And <br/>
I thought it rained PERPETUALLY IN SEATTLE!!!  ;)  Oops, did I let <br/>
that secret out, too?  ;)<br/>
