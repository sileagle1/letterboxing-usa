What is your current opinion on Hitchhikers<br/>
<br/>
Love finding them they add to the hobby   10 (52%)<br/>
<br/>
They're ok.I find them and move them along   4 (21%)<br/>
<br/>
Don't care. Never pick them up just remove from my plants (Yes and <br/>
move along to another box)   3 (15%)<br/>
<br/>
Completely annoying. Wish they would go away   2 (10%)<br/>

For now I still like hitchhikers, especially since I travel and move them<br/>
along to out of the area locations.<br/>
<br/>
Just read your blog article about hiding boxes and boxes themselves.<br/>
Good article. thanks.<br/>
