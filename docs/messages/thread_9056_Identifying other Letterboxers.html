</p><p>My LBNA patch is on the small pack I carry with me. I know this sounds weird, but if I am out and I see others who I think might be letterboxes, if I am not comfortable just going up to them and asking, I shift the pack around so that the patch shows.

</p><p>I'm sure others have insights as well.

It would have to be <br/>something that wouldn't make every person with a backpack think we've <br/>lost our minds. Maybe a question to ask, that another letterboxer <br/>would respond to a certain way, but other people would treat as <br/>ordinary conversation. Any ideas?<br/><br/>Curious Crane<br/><br/>--- In letterbox-usa@y..., Alafair &lt;ms_alafair@y...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Jodi,<br/>&gt; My LBNA patch is on the small pack I carry with me. I know this <br/>sounds weird, but if I am out and I see others who I think might be <br/>letterboxes, if I am not comfortable just going up to them and <br/>asking, I shift the pack around so that the patch shows. It's <br/>brightly colored for its small size, so stands out against my black <br/>pack. It is fun to run into others and exchange stamps and friendly <br/>hellos, but caution always comes first.<br/>&gt; I do go out alone at times (always with cell phone and pepper spray <br/>very handy) and I've sadly had to learn to be more wary. If you are <br/>out alone, trust your gut and if it feels wrong, try to remove <br/>yourself from the area as quickly and safely as possible. <br/>&gt; I'm sure others have insights as well. <br/>&gt; Linda a/k/a Alafair<br/>&gt;  TrekerJo &lt;trekerjo@y...&gt; wrote:Hello and help,<br/>&gt;   On the subject of logo patches-Is this how fellow<br/>&gt; boxers know each other?

I have had meetings on the trail twice.  The first time, I ran into Psychomommy and The Turtle.  By some miraculous "Psychommy ESP" she knew exactly who I was and asked "Are you Firefly?"  Good thing it was me, someone else might have looked at her a little funny!<br/>

The second meeting was last week.  I met VirginiaWaterBird on the trail.  Scott and I were looking for one of her boxes.  She passed us and said hello.   Then she turned around and said "Are you boxers?"  I think the fact that we were carrying pieces of paper and arguing about compass directions probably clued her in!<br/>
