<br/>
General Directions:  From Kernville Rd and Burlando Rd drive past Forest Service Office 2 miles to Whiskey Flat trail and park at end of the road. Enter trail between while fence posts and hike about 1/8 of a mile until you get close to a barb wire fence and beyond and just beyond that is a white fence.  Stay on the main trail and you will come to a steep section.<br/>
<br/>
# 1  The Alten Wedding Bells. When you get to the bottom of the steepest section of the trail so far, stop.  Turn to your right at 150 degrees.  At 28 paces you will come to a huge fallen log. Go to the south side of the log and up along the log for 7 paces to some green lichen covered rocks,  then go up 5 paces angling to your left to a cluster of  rocks over hung with tree branches, forming a shady spot against the embankment.  The box is behind moveable rocks and wedged under a bigger rock near the bottom of the rocky area.   Our daughter was married across the river at Mountain River Adventures Camp on 3/23/02 and this box is dedicated to our MRA friends who helped make the wedding site possible.<br/>
<br/>
# 2  The Love Birds of Bull Run.   After leaving the steep part of the trail there will be a house at 60 degrees and then a wide trail going to your left.  Stay on the narrow right hand trail and soon you will see Bull Run Creek.  Cross the creek (there might be a wire to aid in your rock-log crossing)<br/>
Look up in front of you to an elevated area and to the left of the trail.  </div>
