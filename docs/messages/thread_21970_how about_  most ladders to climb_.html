our gREAT wALL Letterbox requires 1,830 steps to reach (if you don't <br/>
explore any of the guardtowers along the way--otherwise it'd be over <br/>
2,000 steps one way), 3,660 round trip<br/>
--if it's not the one with the most steps, it's definitely the one<br/>
with <br/>
the most 'inconsistent' rise/run ratio along the way  ;)<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly, someone planted a box at Haiku Stairs on<br/>
O'ahu <br/>
awhile back.  I think that's around 4,000 steps--if it's hidden near <br/>
the top.<br/>

Okay, these weren't really ladders so much as they were stairs.  We were on our way home from Colorado last summer when we decided to grab one more set of boxes and do a little bit more sightseeing.  This was the one at Seven Falls (???) I think.  Anyway, we had no idea what we were getting into.  We climbed and climbed and climbed.  It took like 45 minutes to finally reach the top (without stopping once to rest).  Mind you, I'm a lowlander, and by the time we got to the top, my breathing had gotten irradic (sp?) and I just couldn't get enough oxygen in my lungs.  My face was pounding with heat.  I thought I was going to die.  My poor husband started getting really worried about me because of my long list of illnesses.  We sat there at the top for forever trying to recover.  My legs were rubber on the way down.  The positive side?  I got to see some amazing views, got a couple of stamps that were unique, and I lost 10 pounds (throughout the week, although I felt like I left lots of<br/>
 me along the staircase).  That's my story!  If some of you have done this one before, I'd love to know how you fared.  Perhaps I'm a weanie.<br/>

I believe "Eloise" in Chicago is currently designing "Cardiac<br/>
Exercise" which has you continuously going up and down public<br/>
stairways in Chicago.<br/>
