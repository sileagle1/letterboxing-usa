Placed 11-5-2000<br/>
<br/>
Make your way to Beaufort South Carolina if you want to go letterbox <br/>
hunting. Once there you will need to find the island made for such <br/>
things. On the island   give Uncle Sam his due, maybe a buck or two. <br/>
He will then let you see a pine forest falling into the sea. An <br/>
amazing sight, ten to twenty feet per year returns to the sea. You <br/>
need to find the tallest structure the old uncle has preserved from <br/>
sea by moving it from it's original location many years ago. Once you <br/>
find it, take the time to get a view you won't regret. After that, <br/>
take a nature hike to the sea. If you're lucky and no hurricanes have <br/>
passed that way before you, you will come to a small wooden foot <br/>
bridge. To your right is the sea, to your left is where you want to <br/>
be. A palm has fallen and rotted inside out. Within is the treasure <br/>
you seek, please be discrete! I would use a stick rather than reach <br/>
in and risk any critters that may have setup home there. Please <br/>
replace it as you found it, without being observed by other visitors.<br/>
