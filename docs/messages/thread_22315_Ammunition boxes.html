<br/>
I am in the process of planting a letterbox with a tie-in to <br/>
bookcrossing.com.  Near my letterbox, I was going to plant an ammunition box<br/>
<br/>
full of paperback books.  Each paperback was going to be baggied, with a <br/>
larger baggie (or two) holding the individually baggied books, so in a <br/>
sense, they would each be double bagged.  I was wondering if anyone out <br/>
there has done much in the way of ammo boxes and whether or not my idea <br/>
would stay dry.  Any input?<br/>
I was also considering an ammo box to be used for hitchhikers.  Any <br/>
experience or input on that? <br/>

sense.<br/>

I have never seen an ammo box. I wonder if it would cause need for alarm if<br/>
someone either saw you planting it or accidentally stumbled across it (ie:<br/>
terrorist act, murderer, etc..)?? I always remember that incidence of a<br/>
magnetic letter box that someone planted under a mailbox in Auburn? and a<br/>
postal worker called the bomb squad because he didn't know what to think of<br/>
it. An officer contacted the letterboxer once it was determined safe and he<br/>
read the inner contents.<br/>

It's way out on John Tom Hill in East Glastonbury so I doubt anyone would accidentally stumble across it and fear the worst.  It is amazingly sturdy and seems to be waterproof/airtight.  We'll see how it fares up next winter!  MayEve<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am in the process of planting a letterbox with a tie-in to <br/>
&gt; bookcrossing.com.  Near my letterbox, I was going to plant an <br/>
ammunition box<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; full of paperback books.  Each paperback was going to be baggied, <br/>
with a <br/>
&gt; larger baggie (or two) holding the individually baggied books, so <br/>
in a <br/>
&gt; sense, they would each be double bagged.  I was wondering if anyone <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; there has done much in the way of ammo boxes and whether or not my <br/>
idea <br/>
&gt; would stay dry.  Any input?<br/>
&gt; I was also considering an ammo box to be used for hitchhikers.  Any <br/>
&gt; experience or input on that? <br/>
