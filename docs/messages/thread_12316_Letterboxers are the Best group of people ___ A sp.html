I've had my head buried in work stuff for the past week<br/>
(trying to do 5 days work in 4 days - typical after having <br/>
a Monday holiday). I wanted to thank everybody who responded<br/>
to my request about Journals. We haven't had the chance to <br/>
check any out as of yet, but maybe over the weekend we may <br/>
have some luck. <br/>
<br/>
Also, Thanks to the brilliant webmasters, especially Wes, The<br/>
website update is, well, BRILLIANT!<br/>
<br/>
I love the feeling of community that letterboxers share.<br/>
It's so awesome to know that we are connected through <br/>
this Hobby (or in our case obsession). I have made some<br/>
fantastic friends - who I actually think of as friends -<br/>
not just acquaintances, who I think will be life long friends.<br/>
I look forward to every gathering and event and enjoy meeting<br/>
new letterboxers. <br/>
<br/>
Alright, the weekend is here - let's go letterboxing!!<br/>
