I dried out the old log book but it's in pretty sorry shape.  It looks like<br/>

wet.  Would love to see what the new stamp looks like!  Maybe in a few<br/>

Boneyard logbook was in fairly good shape.  I think Vegas Wedding is missing<br/>
all together.  The hole was completely empty, I saw the red rock but no<br/>

  I am still AMAZED that people report finding Feeling Lucky.  I live<br/>
  here and have attempted it five times with no luck.  I have even<br/>
  carved a new stamp for it and made a new log book...and it's not even<br/>
  my stamp!<br/>

  P.S.  I'll go check on the Boneyard box tonight...it's been visited a<br/>
