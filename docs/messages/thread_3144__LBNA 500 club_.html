Sounds like Wanda spent a little too much time with Dr Seuss at the Hanover, NH library these past few days doing Valley Quests!  Here's a poem she wrote up there as she finished up her trip with "Old Man" and "Red Spotted Newt".   (The two she had hoped to get as number #499 and #500, Mt. Lafayette and Mt. Lincoln on the 8 mile Franconia Ridge loop, have apparently already gone missing, so she was really glad to have those other two short but sweet ones as backups!)<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile I've been busy looking for birds and bridges.  I've got a few more to go to reach F500, but we both reached a combined PFX of 500 on August 1st.  We know a few other folks are close or already there, so just let us know when you get there, and we'll be glad to list your name and date in the "LBNA 500 Club" at the bottom of our web page!  We certainly hope that no one will feel resentful or compelled to adopt this particular goal if it doesn't suit them.  We just both happened to be "compulsive collectors", whether it be of stamps, rocks, books, ancestors, trails, highpoints, or whatever, so its only natural that we would adopt this same "gungho" approach to letterboxing.  We hope that our compulsive style doesn't offend anyone, and that we'll find at least a few "kindred spirits" out there.<br/>

==================================================<br/>
I just found my 500th box <br/>
under a little pile of rocks.  <br/>
<br/>
And just 'cause we had so much fun, <br/>
(me and my partner, "Mr Sun"), <br/>
<br/>
we'd like to start a special club <br/>
for those with 500 or above.<br/>
<br/>
And just to make sure that it's fair,<br/>
you can include three countings there:<br/>
<br/>
Placed, found, exchanged all rolled in one,<br/>
so "box away" until you're done!<br/>
<br/>
And then tell us the date you finished<br/>
(and if you had to eat much spinach!)<br/>
<br/>
We'll write your name down on the list<br/>
to see that no one's effort's missed.<br/>
<br/>
It's quite a goal for which to strive,<br/>
so have some fun and feel alive,<br/>
<br/>
as clue by clue, your path comes clear<br/>
and soon the end will seem quite near!<br/>
<br/>
Then "join the club" and help new folks<br/>
by giving hints and telling jokes -<br/>
<br/>
but not too many, just a few,<br/>
so that new folks know what to do,<br/>
<br/>
and spread the word about our quest -<br/>
that letterboxing is the best!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
<br/>

Congratulations!<br/>
<br/>
I think the next milestone should be 2500, or perhaps 5000,<br/>
to give the rest of the field a chance to catch up ... :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Since Wanda was the one reporting them gone, I tend to believe her. What a<br/>
pity, it will be a while before I get around to replacing them.<br/>
