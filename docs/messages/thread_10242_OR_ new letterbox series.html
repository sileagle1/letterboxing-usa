To the Trailhead: These boxes are an addition to the Banks-Vernonia<br/>
State Trail Letterbox Network. Find the details at <br/>

<br/>
To the letterboxes: <br/>
Box  by Funhog- Leaving the Buxton Trestle Box find the 21.3 km<br/>
marker. The Master of Ceremonies awaits 23 steps away at 350 degrees<br/>
magnetic nestled behind a small stump, shaded by verdant swords.<br/>
<br/>
Box by Kool Kat-  Continue on the path. Rounding Hampton Turn look to<br/>
the right and you will spy danger in the company of power. Beyond the<br/>
orange and white messenger you will see a downed log perpendicular to<br/>
the trail. Breeze on over and look beneath.<br/>
<br/>
Box by The Minstrel- Onward to what one might call a letterbox, left<br/>
past a lump of discarded ties, under a lone tie is where you will <br/>
find me.<br/>
<br/>
Box by Windairen- Continue on the main trail until you reach the path<br/>
marked with black and<br/>
yellow.  Climb up and look right.  The box is hiding at the base of a<br/>
paired tree.<br/>
<br/>
Box by Dragondart (After one too many champagne toasts) Farther along<br/>
the main route you will be lured to the left by a route forbidden to<br/>
those with wheels and hooves. Follow this route until a collapsed<br/>
abode is to your right. Six steps off the path, the letterbox rests<br/>
beneath a wooden roof, a clump of trees at your back. <br/>
