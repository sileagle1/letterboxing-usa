I'm a little bit too far north of Philly to make regular boxing forays <br/>
there, but there are a handful of active letterboxers in the area so I'm <br/>
sure you'll get some replies to your query.<br/>
<br/>
You should also make plans to attend The Hunt for the New Jersey Devil, <br/>
"the First Annual (Southern) New Jersey Letterboxing Gathering," scheduled <br/>
for October 26 in New Lisbon, NJ, not too far from Philadelphia. You can <br/>
find more details at:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/events/njdevil.html<br/>
<br/>
With any luck, I'll be there, too.<br/>

<br/>
Welcome to Philly.  <br/>
<br/>
I am organizing the "Hunt for the New Jersey Devil" gathering on<br/>
October 26th.  If you don't have plans that day, please join us.  It<br/>
should be a good time.  Maybe you can interview some people at the<br/>
gathering?  If you can't attend email me off list and maybe we can<br/>
shedule a letterboxing outting together. I live just right over the<br/>
bridge.<br/>
<br/>

Silent Doug and DragonDart there. We've found some of your boxes, <br/>
Doug, and it would be pretty cool to meet the placer of those boxes.<br/>
Dragon, I'll be glad to answer any questions you may have for me. I <br/>
haven't been 'boxing all that long, but I do love the sport/hobby. :)<br/>
<br/>
I know there are more 'boxers in NJ, PA, and DE but we haven't seen <br/>
much of a response about the gathering. Where is everyone???<br/>
This would be a great chance to get into the Halloween "spirit". <br/>
Legend has it that a strange creature haunts the Pine Barrens in NJ. <br/>
He's referred to as "The Jersey Devil". If you want to read more <br/>
about it, go here http://www.strangemag.com/jerseydevil1.html.  It <br/>
gives me chills just thinking about it. **shivers**<br/>
<br/>
I hope to see alot of people there. Hopefully with alot of us around, <br/>
the devil won't show up. I'm gettin' kind of scared. ;)<br/>
