I was fortunate enough to have an entire (beautiful) day to myself on <br/>
Saturday, so I made a stop in Leominster on my way east to Cambridge.  <br/>
Was able to pick up three more of the fantastic "Native Son" series <br/>
there--Buckskin Sam, Robert Cormier, and John Chapman, my 200th Find!  <br/>
Hooray!  I'd just like to report that the Log book for Robert Cormier <br/>
is almost full--it only had two or three pages left.  What with the <br/>
weather getting warmer and all (yes, I know it's supposed to snow like <br/>
crazy for the next couple of days), it won't be long before this log is <br/>
all filled up!  Just a note for the "Lazy Letterboxer," wherever she <br/>
may be these days.<br/>
Happy (almost) springtime!<br/>

<br/>
This discussion of the Native Son Series reminded me of a few I still <br/>
need to find.  What's become of Native Son #7? Does this box still <br/>
exist?  I didn't find its clues on the site.  And how is Native Son <br/>
#4 doing?  We were on our way to collect #4 back in August 2002 when <br/>
we ran out of time (we spent too much time picking wild blueberries <br/>
and were only able to stamp in to Palmer).  This was one of my <br/>
favorite hikes.  I was amazed the bears and deer hadn't eaten all of <br/>
the berries.  I'm planning to head back this spring went the Mountain <br/>
Laurel are in bloom, this should be beautful then.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
