Two (2) easy letterboxes placed on April 21, 2001 at Dinosaur State Park<br/>
in Rocky Hill, CT (Hartford County) by S.Pike and "Frogger".<br/>
<br/>
Information:  The park maintains two and a half miles of nature trails. <br/>
The trails are open year-round from 9:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m.  Pets are<br/>
not allowed on the nature trails.  This is a perfect walk that all ages<br/>
can enjoy.  Trails are well marked and often gravel-lined.  These trails<br/>
appear to be heavily traveled, stamp in and re-hide secretly.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Dinosaur State Park is located in central Connecticut,<br/>
approximately 1 mile east of Exit 23, off I-95 in Rocky Hill.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Park in the designated lot and "walk through geologic time"<br/>
toward the 40-foot geodesic dome of the Exhibit Center.  The Exhibit<br/>
Center houses part of an actual dinosaur trackway, unearthed in 1966<br/>
while excavating for a building.  The tracks remain as they were made<br/>
over 200 million years ago.  While no skeletal remains of the maker of<br/>
these large three-toed tracks have been found, the fossil tracks have<br/>
been named Eubrontes and designated Connecticut's state fossil.  You may<br/>
also wish to visit the outdoor casting area where you can make plaster<br/>
casts of real negative dinosaur tracks (although you must bring your own<br/>
casting supplies).<br/>
<br/>
To the left of the Exhibit Center is a large trail map and information<br/>
booth where portable trail maps may be obtained.  (Ask for trail maps in<br/>
the Exhibit Center if the booth is closed.)  As this was our first visit<br/>
to the park, our clues take you along a circuitous route through the<br/>
trails.  With the help of the trail map, one may find a more direct<br/>
route to these letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Our trek begins at the information booth behind the Amphitheater. <br/>
Follow the Red Trail for a short way, passing a right-hand turn-off to a<br/>
swampy observation platform (kids will want to stop and look for frogs),<br/>
and bending right to pass over a bridge over a swampy stream.  Continue<br/>
to the intersection of Red and Yellow marked by a large fallen tree and<br/>
choose Yellow.  Follow Yellow to the three-way intersection of Red,<br/>
Orange and Yellow, marked by large broken chunks of basaltic rock. <br/>
Follow the Orange Trail on the left. Eventually, Orange will cross an<br/>
access road and you will cross with it and proceed up the stairs.  When<br/>
Orange comes to a "T", continue to the right and pass through an open,<br/>
grassy meadow.  When you reach a "Y" in the trail, choose the left fork<br/>
and walk along with the flow (when running) of a swampy stream through<br/>
another open meadow.  Shortly after rounding the bend on this<br/>
counter-clockwise Orange loop you will notice a "nooning tree" to the<br/>
right of the trail and it's large severed limb lying beside it.  At this<br/>
tree, proceed approximately 15 steps off the trail to the left (240),<br/>
keeping the wood/brush pile to your right, to a small group of flat<br/>
rocks.  In a crevasse behind one of the larger rocks, the Trilobite<br/>
Letterbox is hidden.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in, return to the Orange Trail and continue along your<br/>
original heading.  At the "Y" that began this loop, choose the path to<br/>
the left and stroll back through the grassy meadow.  Shortly, you will<br/>
encounter the familiar "T"; take the right leg (340).  This branch of<br/>
the Orange Trail ascends slightly, back to and across the access road. <br/>
When you return to the Red, Orange, Yellow intersection, take the Yellow<br/>
Trail back to it's intersection with Red at the fallen tree.  Follow the<br/>
Red Trail to the left (320).  The Red Trail passes through a more swampy<br/>
area; this section of trail may be wet, seasonally.  Where Yellow joins<br/>
Red at an intersection marked by a clean-cut stump and an identified red<br/>
oak, continue straight on Red.  The next trail junction is that of Red<br/>
and Blue.  If you are hiking with kids, they will probably want to<br/>
detour over the Red Trail's 300-foot boardwalk through the red maple<br/>
swamp; our journey, however, is along the Blue Trail.  Pass by the<br/>
Yellow Trail on your left and continue for a time along the Blue Trail<br/>
which parallels a traprock ridge.  The basaltic rock here is evidence of<br/>
the hot lava that eventually covered the watery habitat of the<br/>
dinosaur.  (When we planted these boxes, this ridge was covered with<br/>
beautiful drifts of wildflowers - bloodroot, trout lillies, and<br/>
Dutchman's britches.)  Soon you will come to a bench overlooking a<br/>
valley with a rocky drop on the right side of the trail.  Approximately<br/>
20 steps from the bench is the head of a stone wall.  Continue along the<br/>
rocky outcrop on Blue as it bends to the right to meet and pass thorugh<br/>
that same stone wall.  In the wall, on the right side of the trail where<br/>
it passes through the stone wall is hidden the Eubrontes Trail<br/>
Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Stamp in secretly as you may be seen from the bench overlook above or by<br/>
those approaching from the opposite direction.  Return to Blue and<br/>
continue on to complete a clockwise loop.  This section of the trail<br/>
takes you over a planked walk through a swampy area to a grassy orchard<br/>
close to West Street.  Stop and check out the bat shelter!  The Blue<br/>
Trail continues over a small bridge and past a bench before entering<br/>
another open, grassy meadow and branches left to lead to the butterfly<br/>
and native plant gardens.<br/>

Marc and I had hoped to be the first to those letterboxes, however<br/>
Elmer/Sarah/Allison/Kyle minus the S beat us to it.  It was a great day to<br/>
take the walk.  I agree with their description and their comment, the<br/>
Trilobite stamp is perfect.  I will have a scanned image of that stamp on my<br/>
web site by the end of tomorrow (http://www.ksdmsystems.com/letterboxing)<br/>
where I have already put a scan of the LbNA patch for anyone who doesn't<br/>
have one yet and wants to know what it looks like.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Valerie for the patch I got it and it looks great.<br/>
<br/>
Finally welcome to Brian.<br/>
