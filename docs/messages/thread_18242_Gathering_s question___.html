<br/>
Ask for a donation or set up a raffle to cover costs.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of The Kernville Gathering there are no fees for any of <br/>
the events including the white water raft trip and no user fees for <br/>
the park.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There was a shelter charge for the Great Lakes Gathering last year <br/>
which I paid up front when making the event arrangements.  In the <br/>
information I sent out to the attendees and possible attendees <br/>
before the event, I mentioned what the shelter charge was and that <br/>
we would be passing the hat at the event, with no obligation to <br/>
anyone -- pay what you can, and if you can't that is fine.  We <br/>
recouped more than enough to cover the shelter and also other <br/>
supplies that I had not even expected reimbursement for.  <br/>
Letterboxers really are a wonderful bunch of folks ;-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We recently attended the first gathering in Texas, and<br/>
there was a rental fee for the pavillion.  The<br/>
organizer, Silver Eagle, put a box out on the table<br/>
for donations and I was by no means offended by it and<br/>
never even thought to question the appropriateness of<br/>
it!  In fact, I appreciated being given the<br/>
opportunity to donate without having to ask, but if it<br/>
hadn't been on the table, I would've asked and been<br/>
glad to pay whatever he said was my fair share - I<br/>
certainly didn't expect him to foot the bill for all<br/>
that entertainment and good company AND do all the<br/>
organizing too!<br/>
<br/>
If you're considering asking for money directly, I<br/>
think you should let everyone know ahead of time that<br/>
they will be asked to contribute and give an estimate<br/>
of how much they will have to pay.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I liked the box on the table approach<br/>
better than being asked directly.  You'd have to ask<br/>
Silver Eagle, but I'm betting his costs were covered<br/>
on the pavilion.  <br/>

Awesome! I also suggest that when Gatherings are hosted at nonprofit <br/>
preserves, like Moose Hill in MA and Laudholm Farm in ME, people <br/>
think about slipping a twenty into the little donation box. They're <br/>
usually near the front entrance or in the gift shop. Just think what <br/>
those folks can do with a hundred little donations! Jay in CT<br/>

Jay - how thoughtful of you to suggest that. Nautilus and I both thank you for the <br/>
afterthought. I didn't put anything on the gathering suggestion list such as that, <br/>
but it is much appreciated from us folks that scrape by on the non-profit budgets <br/>
and grunt - I mean, grants up here!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for thinking of us,<br/>
