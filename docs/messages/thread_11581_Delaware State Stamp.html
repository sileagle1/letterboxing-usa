.73 miles Easy Walking    Planted By The NeeDeeps 3-29-03<br/>
Directions:From the Junction of RT. 44 and RT. 74, take RT. 74 west then<br/>
turn onto Moose Meadow road on your right.Then turn into Burma road on<br/>
your right this will be the Fenton-Ruby park and Wildlife Preserve pull<br/>
in and park in the parking area.( This is the same starting point as the<br/>
state symbols letterboxes) Walk up Burma road a little way and you will<br/>
see a white trail on the right go past that and when you get to the top<br/>
of the hill you will see a yellow trail on the left.Take the yellow<br/>
trail and follow the dots,you will soon cross over a bridge and walk<br/>
along the banking.Then you will twist and turn through some pine<br/>
trees.You will come out to a opening near the pond their will be a<br/>
wooden bench over looking the water,we always see ducks here.Continue on<br/>
and you will go around a small field then back into the woods and soon<br/>
you'll be walking parallel with a stone wall.you will see green dots on<br/>
the trees but you sick with the yellow walking threw a bunch of skinny<br/>
trees,twisting and turning back near the pond,and then back into the<br/>
woods.soon you will be walking and the trail will bend to the right<br/>
along a stone wall,you will come to a good size tree shaped like a big Y<br/>
or a football goal post,you can't miss it because one of the branches is<br/>
hanging over the trail just above your head,and their is a few rocks<br/>
piled up on the right side of it.Standing even with that tree go 6 paces<br/>
down the trail and stop.Up the little hill behind a old rotten log in<br/>
the stone wall behind a stone door is the Delaware Letterbox.We put a<br/>
log standing up shaped like a Y just to the right of the box to make it<br/>
easy to find.Continue on and you will come to a blue trail keep with the<br/>
yellow to go to your car or go with the blue for some more great<br/>
hiking.If you stayed with the yellow you will soon come back out onto<br/>
Berma RD. take a right and follow down to your car.The NeeDeeps  <br/>
