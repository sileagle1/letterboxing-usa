                    <div class="plaintext-content">Whew!  We just survived a visit by the infamous Martha-by-mail #2.  I<br/>
had waited so long for her arrival, that I had almost forgotten she<br/>
was on the way.  Then she arrived with a bang! -- just as we had torn<br/>
our house apart for a remodeling.  Wouldn't you know it --- she took<br/>
us out shopping for new furnitue for the bedroom, and insisted we buy<br/>
a ton of paint and get going on those painting chores.  Then she<br/>
insisted on staying for a Groundhog's Day party at a friend's house. <br/>
What a stir she caused while dishing out cooking and cleaning advice!<br/>
 She consented to stamping into several letterboxers' journals, but<br/>
only after being assured that she could go visit the Groundhog Day LB<br/>
and get its stamp.  Well that meant waiting for a day when the ground<br/>
wasn't too frozen to find and remove the box.  Delay after delay!<br/>
<br/>
After that she came back to our house and had us move our computer<br/>
around, involving a whole bunch of rewiring.  She finally declared<br/>
that she had done all she could for us, and demanded to be moved on. <br/>
Yesterday she left in a hurry, muttering something like "should I<br/>
testify, should I testify????" under her breath.  I only hope that her<br/>
trial goes well by the time she reaches her next postal victim!<br/>
