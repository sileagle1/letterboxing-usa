morning...they could have been doing some updates.<br/>
Hi guys...I'm new to LB, but this weekend my kids and I found 21 <br/>
letterboxes in 3 days. It's great that there are so many in our area <br/>
in Oregon. We also found the Mini Union Jack HH on Sun. and placed <br/>
it on Mon. what a great weekend and tons of fun. The weather was too <br/>
cruddy to camp, so letterboxing filled up the time quite nicely and <br/>
we could go back home to our warm beds. We do alot of camping in the <br/>
summer and hope to start placing some boxes soon. The kids and I <br/>
have been coming up with some series ideas. <br/>
We will try to get to the Passport To Letterboxing Stamp Camp in <br/>
Battleground,WA, it's not too far from us and I've heard the <br/>
Park/Campground is nice. Hope to meet a few of you there.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails,<br/>
"Smiley" :)<br/>
