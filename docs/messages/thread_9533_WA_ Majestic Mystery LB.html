After all the excellent turkey we had to get out so I carved this <br/>
stamp while enjoying a majestic view of the crown jewel of the <br/>
Northwest.  Of course you cannot skimp with your pocket book or <br/>
hiking legs to head out for this small box.  The box is easy to get <br/>
to, but from there HIKE, HIKE, and HIKE some more.  Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Find the parking area MLIORNEG (word scramble) off of 706 and stretch <br/>
your legs only for a minute.  As you pull into the parking lot on the <br/>
right side 10-15 feet behind the first street light stands 4 trees <br/>
sharing one base.  Under the west side of this base behind a rock is <br/>
the Majestic letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
After you've stamped in continue up for a hike...take in the majestic <br/>
view.  Awesome!!!<br/>
