<br/>
I think it is a great idea to promote boxing for the disabled.  I <br/>
assume your wife is wheelchair bound?<br/>
<br/>
Talking in general terms for other wheelchair users.  Does this limit <br/>
you to paved or boardwalk paths, or is packed dirt in the dry season <br/>
an option?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think a clue sheet that mentions "Disabled Friendly Acess" <br/>
or "Wheelchair Friendly" is appropriate?  I can think of a few boxes <br/>
here in Puget Sound Country that might qualify for such a rating most <br/>
of the year.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to include this designation when appropriate, and hope <br/>
others will as well.  Now that we can edit our own clues sheets, <br/>
perhaps some will go  back and re-think their clues shhet and <br/>
designate the "wheelchair Friendly " ones.<br/>
<br/>
