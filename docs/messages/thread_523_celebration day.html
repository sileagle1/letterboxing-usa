                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings, Letterboxing Friends!<br/>
Today has been a very good day for Der Mad Stamper!<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who haven't already been burdened with every detail of my <br/>
life, let me just explain that after a twelve year hiatus, yours truly has <br/>
recently returned to the life of a college student.  At the age of 35, I <br/>
found myself longing to complete my degree, so (being a citizen of the <br/>
homeland of Nike, Inc.) I decided to "Just Do It!"<br/>
<br/>
Well, today was the day of my last final exam for my first semester since my <br/>
return to school.  Not to brag... but I got straight A's.  (Pardon, while I <br/>
pat my own back...)<br/>
<br/>
What better way to celebrate, than to place a few letterboxes on the campus <br/>
that I'm currently attending?  So that's exactly what I did... after acing my <br/>
last exam, of course!!  On this very day, I placed not one... not two... but <br/>
THREE letterboxes on the campus grounds of Portland Community College.<br/>
<br/>
In case any of you are keeping track, that now makes fifteen letterboxes in <br/>
the state of Oregon!!  In fact, there are now ten letterboxes within the city <br/>
limits of Portland, alone.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping these on-campus boxes might even generate some interest among my <br/>
fellow students.  I thought I might even put up a reference to the LbNA <br/>
website on a bulletin board in the geography department... along with a few <br/>
words that might intrigue some of the map-and-compass-heads in the crowd <br/>
without actually spelling out what's going on to those who are not curious <br/>
enough to investigate on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm just ironing out the details of my clues and should have them <br/>
added to the Letterboxing North America website by tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Summer School, anyone?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations, Mitch.  I did the same thing when I was 30 and went to a 2 <br/>
yr. nursing associate degree program, then for a bachelors in nursing, then <br/>
finally a masters.  It was such hard work, but I was finally doing something <br/>
that motivated me in school, and I, like you, made A's.  I don't think there <br/>
is anything more satisfying than starting feeling like you are maybe too old, <br/>
or too something to keep up with the kids, then discovering you CAN do it, <br/>
and darn well too.  Keep at it!  I had 2 kids who lived in Portland, but <br/>
regrettably have moved away, so I have no reason to go anymore.  I sure did <br/>
love Powells and found them online.  Fortunately, lattes have found their way <br/>
to Fla.  Best, Nancy<br/>

<br/>
Dear Friends,<br/>
Well, first off, let's get one thing straight... I have no intention of <br/>
growing up!!!<br/>
<br/>
I do, however, intend to be a Technical Communicator (you don't know any more <br/>
now than you did before, do you?)<br/>
<br/>
For the last 12 years, I've been working with mechanical and industrial <br/>
engineers... doing CAD work, designing manufacturing facilities, airplane <br/>
parts, and nuclear reactor components.  Also, I had become somewhat of an old <br/>
hand at putting together instruction, operation, and maintenance manuals, and <br/>
other engineering documentation... looks good on a resume, but B-O-R-I-N-G <br/>
(for me, anyway).  Seems I always end up being the guy who polishes all the <br/>
rough edges and makes someone else look good.  Then they get a promotion and <br/>
I start polishing for their replacement... very frustrating!!!<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I've been goofing around with paint programs, making multimedia <br/>
presentations, and teaching myself HTML so I can make webpages.  Fun stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My plan is now to put these experiences all together in one basket, as best I <br/>
can, by becoming a technical communications expert.  I'm taking lots of <br/>
graphic design classes, and working towards an associate degree in technical <br/>
illustration and a certificate in technical writing.  After that, I may start <br/>
working on a bachelors degree (or not).  I'm a member of a trade organizaton <br/>
called the Society for Technical Communicators.  The information I'm <br/>
receiving from them suggests that I will soon be in a good position to take <br/>
on the duties of Publications Supervisor with a major firm, or even start my <br/>
own business doing freelance and contract work.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I'm just enjoying being a student again!!  Thanks for asking... <br/>
and I hope I didn't bore anyone too badly!!  If you understood any of what I <br/>
just wrote, please call my mom and explain it to her.  She's called me three <br/>
times to ask, "What was it that you said you're studying?  Technical <br/>
Something-Or-Other, wasn't it?"<br/>
<br/>
...Oh, I guess this talk list is supposed to be about letterboxing, isn't it? <br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
The clues to my new on-campus letterboxes can be found at:<br/>
http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/pcc.htm<br/>
I'll get them tied into the maps on the LbNA website later today.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend,<br/>
Mitch, Der Mad Stamper<br/>

Mitch, Which PCC campus? Rock Creek, near the other Letterboxes? Any yeah,<br/>
what did you study? Inquiring minds want to know. Yay for Portland<br/>
Letterboxes.  Kevin and I are still working on our 5 to place in<br/>
Oxbow...What slackers we are.  Really though, Dragon Boat races, working<br/>
full time and Wedding planning take up most of our awake time.<br/>

<br/>
No.  I'm attending both Rock Creek and Sylvania campuses.  I may someday try <br/>
to squeeze a box onto the Rock Creek campus somewhere.  But the <br/>
heavily-wooded areas surrounding the Sylvania campus were too much for me to <br/>
resist!<br/>
<br/>
You can take a look for yourself, as I just finished adding the clues to the <br/>
LbNA website at www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
Be careful tramping through the woods, however...  You wouldn't want to wake <br/>
Der Mad Stamper, who may very well be in a nearby treehouse trying to catch <br/>
up on his sleep between classes!!!<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love,<br/>
Mitch, Der Mad Stamper<br/>

Dear Friends,<br/>
Well, first off, let's get one thing straight... I have no intention of <br/>
growing up!!!<br/>
***** GOOD for you, Mitch!!! I was HOPING you'd say that!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
  .........If you understood any of what I <br/>
just wrote, please call my mom and explain it to her.  She's called me three <br/>
times to ask, "What was it that you said you're studying?  Technical <br/>
Something-Or-Other, wasn't it?"<br/>
***** No way. I've had one of those "can't be explained in less that a <br/>
paragraph" jobs myself. Pain in the ASS to tell people about it!!!!!<br/>

Let me echo the other sentiments - BRAVO!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   Seems I always end up being the guy who polishes all the <br/>
&gt;  rough edges and makes someone else look good.  Then they get a promotion and <br/>
&gt;  I start polishing for their replacement... very frustrating!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
This I can relate to big time!  Hope the new skills and credentials will<br/>
eliminate this in the future<br/>
