hunting some new Indiana letterboxes.  We found all 4 of the Winter <br/>
Wonderland series at Summit Lake State Park and enjoyed some nice <br/>
hiking.  The first two boxes in this series are going to be quite a <br/>
challenge when the trees leaf out!  We were the first finders of this <br/>
series -- we think that is a first for us!  I recommend that anyone <br/>
who finds themselves in the East Central part of Indiana check these <br/>
boxes out.<br/>
