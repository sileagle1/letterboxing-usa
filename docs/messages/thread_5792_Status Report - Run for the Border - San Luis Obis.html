<div>#1 Taco Bell all items checked &amp; noted  
Consumption: 2 Tostados,1 Chicken Burrito Supreme, 1 Chicken Quesadilla, 1 Taco 
and 2 colas. Tallied all required items excluding food.</div>
<div> # 2 Taco Bell - Popped 2 Tums prior to entering. All items counted 
and tallied.  Consumption: 2 small colas and two more Tums.</div>
<div>#3 Taco Bell - Two more Tums prior to entering.  All items checked and 
noted. Tallied figures over a shared cola.</div>
<div>We screwed up on the route number but using good investigative techniques 
we guessed at the most obvious possibility . As luck would have it we ended up 
across the street from a city dept.that had all of the addresses and locations 
on an accessible computer. We were delighted that sitting in their front garden 
was this historic bell .The city employee directed us to the other side of 
the street where we checked " Let the garden be your guide " but this box was 
empty. No letter box or guide was to be found .We were tempted to leave our Tums 
package but decided that we probably would need them later.We found no stamp, 
but realized that Ryan needs to put in a couple of disclaimers if he replaces 
the stamp . First- Bring plenty of antacids,  second do not search for this 
stamp on the narrow streets of San Luis Obispo driving a first time rental of a 
26 ft motorhome.   Ryan, it was a burping 
great  3  hour adventure!  Don &amp; Gwen</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry didn't discover the stamp since you went through so much effort <br/>
to find it, but I hope you enjoyed the hunt.  Since this is the <br/>
second time its gone missing so incredibly quickly, I plan to rehide <br/>
the box in a new location.  However, save all your counts since I <br/>
intend to reuse the same counts to get you to a new location.  <br/>
(Unless you have an itching to count tables, chairs, and so on all <br/>
over again.)<br/>
<br/>
That 'city department' you mentioned is pretty interesting to check <br/>
out, beyond just the historic bell.  I really wanted to hide the box <br/>
there, actually, but I couldn't find a good place for it.  (The bell <br/>
is just a tad heavy to try putting the box under it!)<br/>
<br/>
The box had previously already been reported missing and I changed <br/>
the webpage with the clue to indicate as much a few weeks back.  I <br/>
generally try to keep my clues as up-to-date as possible, so its <br/>
always best to check it one last time before you go to make sure <br/>
there hasn't been a change of status or a change in the clue.  I <br/>
generally don't post when I make changes under the assumption that <br/>
nobody actually prints out the clue until they're about to go hunting <br/>
for a box so they'll have the freshest clue possible.  (That's what I <br/>
do!)  Thus, I don't like to waste people's time here by announcing a <br/>
change that's readily available on the webpage.<br/>

What will they think of next?  =)<br/>
