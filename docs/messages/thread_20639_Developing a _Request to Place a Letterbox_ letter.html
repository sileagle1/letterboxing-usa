Hey all ...<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking for some time about placing a letterbox on a <br/>
particularly wonderful piece of property that I very much enjoy and <br/>
think others would enjoy as well.<br/>
<br/>
I won't give away any details yet, but the property is a museum <br/>
requiring admission.  It is private property.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want to place a box without the Director's permission, but <br/>
firmly believe that the advantages of a letterbox on the property <br/>
can easily be sold to him.  There are hundreds of acres to the <br/>
grounds and plenty of places to hide a letterbox where hunters would <br/>
not trample or damage the grounds themselves.  Bringing people to <br/>
the museum, which struggles sometimes with attendance, is a big plus.<br/>
<br/>
I called the museum and spoke with the Director.  He had not heard <br/>
of letterboxing before.  I gave him a quick overview and emphasized <br/>
that the box would not cause harm to the property and that placing <br/>
such a box could help draw people to the museum.  He seemed <br/>
receptive.  He mentioned that this kind of idea sounded like it <br/>
would fall under the Event Director's realm (I didn't think until <br/>
later that he may not have realized that the letterbox would be <br/>
permanent ... I'm not sure).  He also informed me that the property <br/>
will be closing for the season this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
They used to remain open through Christmas, but have been closing on <br/>
Columbus Day weekend the last couple of years.  That's OK as I <br/>
wouldn't expect many people to hunt the box outside of the spring <br/>
and summer months anyway.  It does, however, remove the option of <br/>
placing the box now -- I'll have to wait until spring.<br/>
<br/>
He asked me to send him a letter with my request.<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to compose a well-developed request letter that explains <br/>
what letterboxing is, points out that it is a benign activity, and <br/>
discusses why the placement of a box in an environment such as this <br/>
would be beneficial to the museum.  All of this should be said in a <br/>
letter that has much more brevity than this post.  Essentially, I <br/>
seek to inform, eliminate any potential concerns, and convince of <br/>
the advantages in a consise format.  The Director will likely be <br/>
interested in reading multiple pages.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for assistance in developing such a letter -- with no <br/>
disrespect meant to anyone, preferably from those of you who may be <br/>
involved in developing similar types of commnication in your jobs or <br/>
other activities.  I do not beleive the letter included in the Files <br/>
will suit this purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I welcome any suggestions or templates that help meet this goal.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>

I know that both SpringChick and Funhog have done a ton of work and <br/>
established good working relationships with State Park and/or NPS <br/>
staff in their states. I'm sure there are others on the list who <br/>
have also been involved in education of 'officials. (Thank you, each <br/>
one of you for making things easier for all the rest of us!)<br/>
<br/>
I checked the files area and found that SpringChick has already <br/>
posted something like what you are looking for. I think the letter <br/>
was written by the member, Red Bing, who was mentioned before in <br/>
another response to your request. <br/>
<br/>
SpringChick has posted both a file in Word format and one in txt <br/>
format.  Here's a short link to the files area where her work can be <br/>
found. http://tinyurl.com/646cw<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>

<br/>
ps: You might want to drop her a thank you note. (grin)<br/>

You may have found it already, but Red's letter is in the Files <br/>

I am aware of the letter in the Files section but as I mentioned in <br/>
my original post (sorry, I know it was long), this letter won't serve <br/>
the purpose I need.  I'm not intending on placing a box in a state <br/>
park, etc., but rather on private land.  Telling the Director of a <br/>
museum that planting a box in the woods is a good idea isn't going to <br/>
win support.  I'll need to convince him that placing a box on the <br/>
grounds of the museum will draw more visitors to that museum without <br/>
damaging the grounds themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Similar in intent to the letter in those files, but different in <br/>
approach.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have a working model from e-mails sent to me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions, though.<br/>

&gt; I am aware of the letter in the Files section but as I mentioned in <br/>
&gt; my original post (sorry, I know it was long), this letter won't serve <br/>
&gt; the purpose I need.  I'm not intending on placing a box in a state <br/>
&gt; park, etc., but rather on private land.  Telling the Director of a <br/>
&gt; museum that planting a box in the woods is a good idea isn't going to <br/>
&gt; win support.  I'll need to convince him that placing a box on the <br/>
&gt; grounds of the museum will draw more visitors to that museum without <br/>
&gt; damaging the grounds themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Similar in intent to the letter in those files, but different in <br/>
&gt; approach.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I have a working model from e-mails sent to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the suggestions, though.<br/>

Hey Scott,<br/>
<br/>
When you finish your working model to your satisfaction,  could you please <br/>
post it in the file section as well.  No reason for ME to reinvent the wheel if <br/>
you're gonna do the work for me *grin*  Thanks!<br/>

&gt; Hey all ...<br/>
<br/>
(snipped most excellent post)<br/>
<br/>
Great minds think alike.  I placed my Peace On Earth letterbox for <br/>
the same reason.  A wonderful spot for a letterbox that also provided <br/>
free advertising for the owner of the establishment.  A win/win <br/>
situation for all.<br/>
<br/>
I did not have to supply a letter, and I was lucky enough for the <br/>
owner to permit the letterbox to remain there during the off season.<br/>
<br/>
I did, however, have to make sure all the important caveats were in <br/>
the letterbox clues to make all seekers know what was okay and what <br/>
was out of bounds during the off season.<br/>
<br/>
And in the two years that the letterbox has been there, NOT ONE <br/>
SINGLE SOLITARY BOXER HAS STRAYED FROM THE CAVEATS IN THE CLUES.<br/>
<br/>
NOT EVEN ONE.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations to EVERYONE who has hunted this box and has respected <br/>
the wishes of the owner of the establishment.  The owner has recently <br/>
contacted me to see if I want to place ANOTHER letterbox on the <br/>
grounds.  How cool is that?<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with this project, CPAScott.  Only good, better, and most <br/>
excellent things can come of it.  Another win/win situation in the <br/>
works!<br/>
<br/>
And if the director would like some form of letter of reference for <br/>
this type of box placing, I'll be willing to bet that the owner of <br/>
the location for Peace on Earth would supply one.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I can help in any way.<br/>
