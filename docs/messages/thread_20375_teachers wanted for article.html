If you are a teacher who has used letterboxing with your students, and<br/>
would like to assist a writer for the following web site, e-mail us.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Web site Education World<br/>
&gt; (http://www.educationworld.com), a free online publication for K-12 teachers<br/>
&gt; and administrators. My editor recently forwarded some background on<br/>
&gt; letterboxing and a link to your site and asked me to look into the<br/>
&gt; possibility of creating a story about how teachers can use it with students.<br/>
&gt; I see that you do have a section for kids, and I'd like to know if you might<br/>
&gt; be able to put me in touch with 2-3 teachers who are involving kids with<br/>
&gt; letterboxing. If I'm able to find some teachers who are willing to share<br/>
&gt; their comments, I would love to write a story that would feature their<br/>
&gt; experiences<br/>
