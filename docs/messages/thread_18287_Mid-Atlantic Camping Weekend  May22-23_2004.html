Scarab, Night Owl and Tuxie of the Doubtful Guests will be there.  <br/>
Campsite.  <br/>
<br/>
We have 2 BIG tents and would be happy to share one if someone <br/>
needs "a place to stay".<br/>
<br/>
It would be cool to have a cabin that could become the "hospitality <br/>
suite" for the group.  <br/>
<br/>
What arrangements do we need to make?<br/>

None, yet.  Next week we will tally preliminary numbers and call the<br/>
campground to reserve some sites.  As the date draws near, we will<br/>
firm up the numbers and confirm with the park.<br/>

Have you joined and posted this gathering to the yahoo group - LBMA - <br/>
LetterBoxing Mid-Atlantic? I don't know if all the LBMA folks also <br/>
belong to letterbox-usa.  If not, I can post a reference to your <br/>
message #39593 so they can respond for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, if I don't get a timeshare hit and head to CT that <br/>
weekend, I'll be there as a daytripper.  My only camping gear is an <br/>
8lb down sleeping bag I use to haul around as a Girl Scout back in <br/>
the 60's.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted as to which park site/area we will be gathering.<br/>

groups interested (two with furried friends) so we will be camping in<br/>
the pet loop in the Hollofield area.  If anyone else would like to<br/>
join us, please e-mail me off-list at eileenbriley at yahoo dot com.<br/>
