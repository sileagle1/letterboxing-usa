has  lots of boxes and a great group of  people willing to place some<br/>
kid-friendly ones.  My 5yo is my most enthusiastic companion and my 2 yo<br/>
just got her own stamp.  We started when she was 16 months old.  I have used<br/>
a combo of stroller, back-pack and letting her walk.  I keep her motivated<br/>
by playing games along th<br/>
e way (great opportunity to learn counting colors, etc) and we always end<br/>
with a treat--usually a visit to the park's play area.  The biggest<br/>
challenge is when I need to go off trail to retreive the box--gotta make<br/>
sure hte babe doesn't escape!<br/>
<br/>
What do others do to keep their little ones enthused?<br/>

 This is<br/>
&gt; a fantastic activity for my 2 year old and me to share. We<br/>
&gt; get outside, find new<br/>
&gt; places, look for treasure! I wish I knew about it 2 years<br/>
&gt; ago! I would have been<br/>
&gt; tromping through old cemetaries with my newborn in a sling!<br/>

Sorry - what's this abbreviation?  <br/>
<br/>
I have a 7 year odl , 4 year old and 2 year old and they're all really into <br/>
'boxing.  I look for kid-friendly directions - no more than an hour or two <br/>
hike, not to steep or strenuous, near other attractions like playground, marsh or <br/>
lake or nature center and labor sweatily over how to make this a <br/>
tutoring/homeschool lesson, depending on the box.  I bring a sling and sometimes a <br/>
stroller, depending on the terrain, but the older two walk and I encourage the <br/>
youngest to walk.  I always plan a lot of time and let the kids set the pace, though <br/>
they usually love to run through it and are eager to find the box.<br/>
