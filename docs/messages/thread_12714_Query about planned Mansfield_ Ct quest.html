&gt; Ginger Blue                            &gt;Thats funny because Kathy and I are also taking tomorrow off to go letterboxing around Mansfield.Have you ever been to Kathy John's at the intersection of RT.195 AND 44 They have good food,and a side room that is a letterboxers paradise.It's full of stamps and ink pads and all kinds of things for letterboxing.And don't forget to bring the clues for the Kathy johns letterbox,I think it's called KJ'S best or something like that.The box is right in the restraint,so you can get a bite to eat and another stamp at the same time.Well hope we run into each other so we can get a exchange.Lenny/Kathy The NeeDeeps. <br/>

They have incredible ice cream too!  I have fond memories of an <br/>
outting to that place as a kid where I was allowed to have mint <br/>
chocolate chip ice cream for breakfast one Saturday morning! Yum!  <br/>
<br/>
Also Willington Pizza is not to far from mansfield... maybe 3 minutes <br/>
from UCONN and has good pizza.  Might even seen a Uconn B-Ball star <br/>
waiting tables... we saw one there a couple years ago!<br/>
