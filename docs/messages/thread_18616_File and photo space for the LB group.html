That time has come again when we are coming close to running <br/>
out of  storage space in our group site.  Some of the photos and <br/>
files that are in there are repetitive or not very applicable to the <br/>
group as a whole.  The files section, in particular, is quite full.<br/>
<br/>
We are asking for you help in reducing the storage space <br/>
problem.  Could you review additions you have placed in there <br/>
and see if you feel we still need them.  If you do this for us, it <br/>
saves us from having to delete files that others may wish to have <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that an easy way to solve this problem is to post the <br/>
photos or files on an independent website and then you can post <br/>
the link to the list.  It uses much less memory that way, and it is <br/>
easier to do than some might think.  There are many websites <br/>
(such as Yahoo/Geocities) that will take you step by step through <br/>
the process and you don't need to know anything about <br/>
programming codes.<br/>
<br/>
We would really appreciate your help with this concern.<br/>

<br/>
I created two folders in the Files Section (Mystery<br/>
Gathering Recipes and MA Trail Maps).<br/>
<br/>
I figured that the Mystery Gathering recipes could go,<br/>
but I cannot delete the folder without deleting the<br/>
contents, and I cannot delete the contents because<br/>
other posters have added files to the folder.<br/>
<br/>
Ditto for MA Trail Maps!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, dear, it's a Catch-22 for me.  I did want you to<br/>
know that I tried, and if you have some kind of<br/>
omnipotent power and you can override the barriers,<br/>
please feel free to delete these two folders.<br/>
<br/>
Regretfully (but with good intentions!) yours,<br/>
<br/>
