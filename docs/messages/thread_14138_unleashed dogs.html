                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have had quite a phobia about dogs, though I grew up with a sweet <br/>
hound. Yes, my phobia is from being bitten while on my paper route ( <br/>
I was 12 and the woman denied the fact her dog bit me)and from being <br/>
circled by a German shephard on a dark night as I walked down the <br/>
road. (I was about 15). <br/>
 Well, now I live (temporarily)with two doggers ( a pitbull and a <br/>
pitbull mix) along with my adult daughter (temporalily).  This <br/>
experience has been difficult but truly rewarding. The dogs are <br/>
intelligent, responsive and loyal. They are always on leash, and <br/>
respond to my commands. They are protective and can be dog agressive <br/>
so we take the sensible precautions while hiking. <br/>
  I frequently hike alone and it is dogs off leash that I fear more <br/>
than humans off leash.  Thanks very much to the people who posted the <br/>
proper steps to take when accosted by off-leash dogs.  I kind of knew <br/>
that stuff, but need the reasurance now and again. <br/>
   Cat lover/gardener/teacher  shall I add, lover of certain well-<br/>
behaved dogs??<br/>
