<br/>
Mystery Falls Letterbox<br/>
Placed 5/30/02 by Stephani, John, John Turner and Maggie the Dog<br/>
Duration of this walk could be anywhere from about an hour to three hours depending...<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is hidden along a section of the Narragansett Trail near Green Falls Pond.  There are several ways to access this trail but we recommend parking at the green gate on Green Falls Road.  To get to Green Falls Road:  Turn on to Sand Hill Road from Route 49 in Voluntown (this turn is marked by the Studio Farm which sits on the corner); after turning left then right around one of the Palmer farms in the area, Green Falls Road goes straight while Wheeler Road bears to the right; Green Falls Road quickly turns to a dirt road; the Narragansett Trail (blue blazed) crosses once and a bit further up on the left you will see the green gate; park here.<br/>
