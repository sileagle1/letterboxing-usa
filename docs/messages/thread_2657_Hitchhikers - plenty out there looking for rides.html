    June, it seems, has been a good month for us to get "travelers" in motion.  First we put Jolly G Man's "Thru-Hiker" back on the trail shortly after picking up the Elements' "Backpacker" for the third time!  Then we found Dan and Melissa's "Moose on the Loose" again and this time got her safely out of Rhode Island, the state that once killed a moose for wandering in by mistake!  Then we took Lonemasswolf and YIMS's "Happy Birthday" hitchhiker for a "wild ride"!  Finally, we decided to launch one of our own:  "The Little Tiny Sailboat" (not to be confused with the Drew Clan's "Tall Ship" which we relaunched a couple of months ago after it had been stuck in port for over half a year!)   Another one of ours soon to start circulating through the countryside is called "Falling Leaves".  So you see, there are quite a few hitchhikers presently out and about in southern New England just waiting for you to give them a lift to a new spot!<br/>
<br/>
    We are also anxiously waiting to hear word of the whereabouts of Mercy Brown, the "Exeter Vampire", whom, after a flurry of excitement, we left resting in Peace way back in early March.  We found her sleep had been disturbed several weeks later and wonder if she's now "back in circulation".  We are also curious as to whatever happened to Renee's "Groundhog", which we found in early February and left shortly thereafter at Pettaquamscutt Rock.  We wonder if she has found a new place to "hole up" in yet or is still searching.  (You see, it's fun not just for the original owners to keep track of their travelers, but for all of us letterboxers to follow their wanderings as well.)  Thanks for keeping those little hitchers moving!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
