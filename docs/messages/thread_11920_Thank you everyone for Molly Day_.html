Thank you everyone for making the Molly Day Gathering a success. Yesterday,<br/>
I tried to make a rough count on how many people might be there. I figured<br/>
about 14. We were overwhelmed when the attendance was between 35-40 people<br/>
and a couple dogs. It was so nice to see the faces to match the stamps we<br/>
have been seeing in so many letterboxes. Four Hitchhikers were also there:<br/>
The Worlds Fishiest Hitchhiker, Spare Tire Hitchhiker, Support The Troops<br/>
Hitchhiker and the debut of Molly Looking For Ginger Hitchhiker. A special<br/>
thanks to Carolyn, Leader of the Pack, Butterfly and Irishtinker for all<br/>
their time and efforts for the box planting and this great gathering. We<br/>
were impressed with the work and quality of the stamps made for Molly. The<br/>
boxes were "Molly Key To My Heart", "The Key To Mollys Success","Molly Our<br/>
Hero" and the Molly Day event stamp. The weather and day turned out perfect.<br/>
Thank you to everyone who came. We had a wonderful time! Thank you on behalf<br/>
of Molly.....Chuck, Molly and Chickabirdie<br/>
