There are actually a fair number (at least for Colorado) of <br/>
letterboxes near the Durango area!  On the campus, in town,  Animas <br/>
Overlook (which has something like 5) and in the mountains and into <br/>
Silverton.  Easy ones and some that need you to strap on your hiking <br/>
boots. <br/>
And I for one am tickled pink to hear there are a few more in the <br/>
works.. woot!<br/>
<br/>
Es, waiting for the sign to GO!<br/>

&gt; I just moved from Pagosa Springs last spring.  From previous <br/>
&gt; messages it sounds like your boxes may be in/near Durango, but I <br/>
&gt; didn't notice them on the map.  Am I right?  The Animas flows <br/>
right <br/>
&gt; through town and there's a college there so it seemed to match up <br/>
&gt; with the other LB mentioned.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yeah, you can get by the construction just fine, but three weeks <br/>

&gt; &gt; there was still a foot of snow on the road by the campground. <br/>
&gt; Probably <br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot more at the overlook. I'll send you a note offlist and let <br/>
