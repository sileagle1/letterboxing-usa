This American Life / NPR letterbox<br/>
<br/>
We traveled from Baltimore, Maryland to Boston, Mass in  a weekend to<br/>
see the "This American Life:  Lost in America" NPR program at the Berklee<br/>
Performance Center, and left this box (although no where near Berklee).   <br/>
<br/>
We instead left it dead center in the middle of the city, OK maybe not the <br/>
city but at least near a major T line stop (Downtown Crossing).    This <br/>
box is placed in The Boston Public Gardens.  <br/>
<br/>
First, find the Boston Public Gardens (we took the downtown crossing<br/>
stop, but I know there is one closer).   Enter at the West entrance to the <br/>
park, you should see Good old George Washington riding his horse w/ his sword<br/>
missing.  Walk across the bridge and over the lake, where the swans (both in <br/>
real and boat-form) live.   At the end of the bridge take the stairs to the <br/>
left (north). Don't feed the geese, they tend to attack. Follow the path <br/>
north by the lake. Follow this path till it forks.  Bear right at the fork <br/>
(20 deg), and you'll start to see a line of bronze ducks to celebrate the <br/>
writing of the Ugly Duckling.   Walk along the ducks, to the very last <br/>
duckling.   Staring straight at the last duck take a reading of 138 deg.    <br/>
Follow this path for  72 steps and you will find your prize hidden behind a <br/>
tree and under/next to a stone.  Don't forget to not walk over the bench.   <br/>
<br/>
This is a very popular and crowded park so be discreet.  Please place box <br/>
exactly where you  find it, trust us theres not many places to hide it.<br/>
<br/>
Please report any problems with this box to the charm city box company world <br/>
