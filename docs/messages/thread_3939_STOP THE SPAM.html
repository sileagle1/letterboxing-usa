the prices we pay for the free service. The couple of ads per week <br/>
(or even month) that sneak in don't seem so bad to me. It's not <br/>
really SPAM, where someone maliciously sends the list 100 copies of <br/>
the same email. Now that's awful. Yahoo actually does a pretty good <br/>
job keeping the junk mail off-line compared to some other services we <br/>
use.<br/>
<br/>
But there is a new thing that REALLY bothers me. Anyone else have the <br/>
option "recieve no email and read on the web only?" If so, you'll get <br/>
to enjoy a new function that I first noticed last night----yahoo is <br/>
putting up huge flashing banner advertisements right in the middle of <br/>
the text of each posting. I didn't so much mind the old ads at the <br/>
top of each page, especially since they're static and don't flash and <br/>
hop around demanding attention, but these new ones are a DRAG!<br/>
<br/>
I posted (spammed?) half a dozen complaints to yahoo, but it's <br/>
actually hard to find a complaint center for them and I'm sure they <br/>
could care less what I think.<br/>

Ahh.  As always every great innovation (radio, television, printing press,<br/>
clothes, cars, highways, mail, phone, heck even pencils.) are soon ruined<br/>
by advertising.<br/>
<br/>
Lets hope that they don't start advertising on rubbermaid containers. I<br/>
would hate to go find a nice little letterbox deep in the woods, only to<br/>
shown an add for wallymart telling me I should be shopping to boost the<br/>
economy.<br/>

along from Yahoo at the bottom of each email - as someone noted, just the<br/>
'price' of free email service for this type of group.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, if you try to reply to these messages through their links, you<br/>
only encourage them. It proves 1) You have an active email box and 2) You<br/>
read your junk email and 3) You respond to it -- even if in a negative way.<br/>

It seems entirely possible from what you wrote that Yahoo personal <br/>
accounts use antispam filters that are not put into effect on their <br/>
mailing list server. I run my own mailserver and use a variety of <br/>
filters which has resulted in me not receiving any of the spam that <br/>
apparently has continued to intermittently plague the list. Without <br/>
boring anyone with details of how such server side filters work, it <br/>
seems your suggestion of folks creating a Yahoo address for list mail <br/>
may solve the problems for those of us who hate _any_ spam.<br/>
