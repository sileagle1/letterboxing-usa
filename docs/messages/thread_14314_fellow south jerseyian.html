<br/>
Glad to see that I am not the only South Jersey letterboxer out there.<br/>
 I live in Moorestown.  I have been doing this for about a year now. <br/>
I have been considering changeing to Geocaching because there are a<br/>
heck of a LOT more in south jersey than letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
I am a 33 (but feel 18) year old married female.  Hubbie goes along<br/>
with this hobby only to see me be safe, I am sure he's not really<br/>
interested in it.  We have no kids yet so I can't drag them with me. <br/>
My friends are not into this hobby either.  I've tried but no go.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can hunt down some boxes together or as a team we can start<br/>
making some boxes for south jersey and start getting other people<br/>
involved too.  I wish I lived in CT because it's soo over packed with<br/>
letterboxes.  I have about 4 boxes to plant but can not seem to come<br/>
up with a good location for them.  Everywhere down here is soooo<br/>
over-populated, I'm worried about the location and people watching the<br/>
"boxer" and then destroying it.  But, I guess every letterbox planter<br/>
has these thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I hope to hear from you soon.  Let's hunt those boxes down and<br/>
get those stamps!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, by the way I have been a member of that group "ghost towns" for<br/>
over a year now.  I posted some pictures also.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Bee<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I was also curious about any other NJ letterboxers out there.  I'm <br/>
&gt; not comfortable tramping through woods alone, and my boyfriend will <br/>
&gt; doubtless eventually get tired of chasing tupperware boxes.   He's <br/>
&gt; not a LBer.  Anybody from NJ, especially the Cherry Hill area?  <br/>
