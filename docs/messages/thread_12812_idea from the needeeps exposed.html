(ah, why not :-))<br/>
<br/>
The idea of online logging has been around for a long time (at least since<br/>
the inception of geocaching.com), and actually well before then.  Certainly<br/>
looks like a good idea, so, just to be contrary, I'll comment on why I<br/>
dislike it (tho I am certainly in a huge minority on this one :-))<br/>
<br/>
First, I'll grant that the specific idea proposed (we found the box and<br/>
it is damaged) is different (yet a subset) the general category of online <br/>
logging, and has more positives and less negatives than the general idea,<br/>
but, in reality, anything you do will be the general idea.  So I'll yada <br/>
yada about that ...<br/>
<br/>
I think my objection to this idea stems from my early worldview of <br/>
letterboxing as simulated treasure hunting.  Hider interacts with place<br/>
and creates textual representation of place and location of box (what I<br/>
call "the map"), in such a way that _he_ would be able to find the box<br/>
(pirates didn't write treasure maps for others to find -- the idea was to<br/>
jog _their_ memory, but be _obscure_ to others (we, of course, take some<br/>
liberties to make the game playable).  This mapping is necessarily <br/>
imperfect.  Hunter interacts with map and place to find box.  Further, <br/>
over time the place decays (changes) (as does the text, actually), and <br/>
the mapping becomes more imperfect.  This represents two sides of what <br/>
I call the golden triangle of treasure hunting.  The thrill of discovery <br/>
occurs when these imperfections are experienced.<br/>
<br/>
The side of the triangle that is missing is the interaction of the <br/>
hunter and the placer.  Information flow on this link is perfect, thus<br/>
thrill in the gaps is eliminated (there are other thrills of course,<br/>
for some, but these don't fall in the category of simulated treasure<br/>
hunting).  <br/>
<br/>
Online logging of this and that about a box has the effect of connecting<br/>
that link (once someone has found the box, they generally have the<br/>
same info as the hider -- if they _haven't_ found the box, the negative<br/>
information presented helps to bridge the link as well.  Keep in mind <br/>
the simple act of stating "I found box X" conveys tons of information <br/>
along that link -- intelligent people can differ on how much -- suffice <br/>
it to say that it is much more information that the author presented you <br/>
with (any more information presented necessarily conveys the "I found <br/>
the box" plus other stuff)).<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, it removes the mystique.<br/>
<br/>
Now, the obvious objection to my words is this -- how is that different<br/>
from the talk list?<br/>
<br/>
My answer is twofold --<br/>
<br/>
a) I think there _is_ too much direct chitchat on the list about where <br/>
the letterboxes are hidden (like I said, I'm in the minority :-)).<br/>
<br/>
b) In my philosophy, it comes down to the metaphor of "fermentation"<br/>
vs "distillation" (two ways to make booze -- beer and wine vs hard <br/>
liquor).  I can't explain how I use this metaphor to think about things,<br/>
but the gist is that "fermented" things tend to be mellow and just<br/>
right, while "distilled" things seem to have the risk of being too much, <br/>
or a good idea taken too far (selective breeding vs genetic engineering)<br/>
(this is a metaphor, not starting a debate about genetics or drinking).<br/>
(Hoyt Axton displays this metaphor brilliantly in the lyrics of the song<br/>
_The Pusher_ (most famous recording by Steppenwolf)).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I see the list as fermentation -- some information leaking <br/>
around that is generally lost to all but the most intrepid <br/>
hunters -- a diffusion of information thru the community, while online <br/>
logging is the information distilled right out there as an addendum to <br/>
what the author has presented as his puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
So, that's my philosophy on this in a (long) nutshell.<br/>
<br/>
That's my main point.  I guess there are some other (minor) things as well --<br/>
<br/>
&gt; so people don't travel half way across the State for nothing<br/>
<br/>
* In my mind its about place and puzzle.  So I don't care if there is no<br/>
box when I show up.  I think if a box is done well, it won't be "for<br/>
nothing".<br/>
<br/>
* I think if you are going to do this, you have to make sure you have<br/>
some sort of safeguard so clueless[1] or malicious people can dis boxes <br/>
easily (falsely report them missing, falsely claim landmarks have changed, <br/>
etc).  Keep in mind that 3 people claiming the box is missing, and posting <br/>
it in an online log, when in fact the box is there but they could not find <br/>
it, will have the effect of dissing it.  (Many, many people, for example,<br/>
have reported mapsurfer #2 missing, but it has always been there when I<br/>
went).<br/>
<br/>
In a normal community (small town or tribe), reputation solves this <br/>
problem (we learn who is clueless or malicious, and people learn not to<br/>
be clueless or malicious).  As communities become virtual, large, or both, <br/>
these problems become harder to solve (e-bay has solved this very well --<br/>
its too much for what we do, but illustrates the scope of the potential<br/>
problem).<br/>
<br/>
* Alot of my thought is the thrill of discovery and mystique.  Expanding<br/>
in that vein, there is the thrill of the _real_ log in the _real_ woods, <br/>
and being a member of that exclusive club that has made it there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that I have no more say than anyone else in whether these<br/>
ideas are implemented, and I'm not trying to say "bad idea" -- just <br/>
present some words from a different point of view about where I derive<br/>
fun in this game (one of the reasons I prefer it to geocaching -- if <br/>
you like the geocaching model, do some geocaching, but don't put online<br/>
logs on my boxes and turn them into geocaches).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>
[1] don't take the term "clueless" the wrong way.  No other piece of <br/>
short language comes to mind to mean "one who thinks they know but<br/>
in fact does not".<br/>
