                    <div class="plaintext-content">Happy New Year to all! Here in the nation's geographically smallest <br/>
state, we're having a great time letterboxing. As others have noted, <br/>
we have good box coverage in all major areas of the state. And our <br/>
little state is #5 in total number of boxes at 208 and growing. Wow! <br/>
This past year people have planted boxes in some unexpected places.<br/>
<br/>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it looks like there are only 7 cities <br/>
and towns left that don't have box(es): Central Falls, Cranston, <br/>
Johnston, North Providence, North Smithfield, Pawtucket, and <br/>
Woonsocket. Middletown does have some (Fond Farewell is incorrectly <br/>
listed in Newport) and so does New Shoreham (aka Block Island).<br/>
<br/>
NOW- for the action phase. We will volunteer to plant a box in <br/>
Central Falls. No kidding- it's almost ready to plant and post. Who <br/>
else would like to contribute to the effort? Do any other states have <br/>
boxes in every municipality? It shouldn't be hard for us to pull it <br/>
off in a state this size. It would just be nice to be able to find <br/>
letterboxes EVERYWHERE in the Ocean State. Let's go Little Rhody!<br/>

This is a New Year's resolution I can actually handle.  Put me down for Pawtucket.  I've actually been thinking about it for awhile and have a couple of ideas.  Wish me luck because I'm still struggling with the carving skills.  Happy New Year!!!<br/>
