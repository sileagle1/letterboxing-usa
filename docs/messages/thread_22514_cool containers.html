You've hidden letterboxes in pet coffins?  Is someone actually <br/>
marketing these?  I'm such a low tech girl (or something) that all I <br/>
could picture was a logbook and stamp lovingly wrapped in Kitty's <br/>
favorite blanket and buried in the back yard.<br/>
<br/>
And as far as posting pictures of Robb's cleverly disguised boxes....  <br/>
Well, y'all are going to have to find them yourselves!<br/>

Yes indeed. The guy that made mine did a beautiful job..traditional <br/>
coffin shape, all dovetailed joints and even some decoration on the <br/>
lid. He markets them to pet owners for their hamsters, gerbils, birds, <br/>
lizards, and the like. I actually have 3 coffin boxes hidden. :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for making them work to see Robb's boxes. What was I <br/>
thinking?!?  *grin*<br/>
