                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although I am sure I will make no friends with this post I have to <br/>
say that in my opinion we letterboxers are not doing a very good job <br/>
at following the Leave NO Trace ethics. I have seen children of <br/>
fellow boxers breaking branches, boxes planted in places that in no <br/>
way can be reached without destroying the surrounding vegetation, and <br/>
clues so vague you are forced to look under every rock and behind <br/>
every tree. And although I am sure we all love the outdoors, everyone <br/>
has a different idea of what is harmful and destructive. The parent <br/>
who lets their child destroy their surroundings is not going to think <br/>
twice about what they are stepping on to get to that box. And even <br/>
though I try hard to follow the Leave NO Trace ethics I am not <br/>
perfect. I have a few boxes that are probably a little too far off <br/>
trail, I will occionally walk around a puddle instead of through it, <br/>
and I have been known to pick a single flower or leaf to take home <br/>
for ID purposes.  <br/>
<br/>
My point is that although we THINK we don't do any damage others <br/>
might be shocked. We seem to be under the impression that we can do <br/>
no harm just because we like being outdoors. Take a minute to reflect <br/>
on how you letterbox and you might be surprised. <br/>
<br/>
 As for the horticulturalist, he left the box there for at least a <br/>
short time on a trial basis. WE are the ones who did not live up to <br/>
his standards! <br/>

Congrats, I generally agree.  It's a contradiction in terms<br/>
to leave no trace, *except* the box we are leaving behind :-)<br/>
<br/>
As a past boy scout, I wouldn't worry about LNT ethics, as we<br/>
used to cut switches from green limbs, right off the trees,<br/>
burn whatever we could find and left behind biodegratable waste.<br/>
Letterboxers in general seem to be less invasive then we were.<br/>
<br/>
Pragmatically, I take LNT to mean don't break anything, don't<br/>
do anything to put furry woodland creatures out of their homes,<br/>
and generally leave it the way you found it.<br/>

In the big picture, I take comfort in knowing the rangers did<br/>
more than I will ever do by paving parking lots :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree that the degree to which the Leave no Trace <br/>
principles are interpreted is subjective.<br/>
<br/>
For those who have never actually been to the LNT website, the <br/>
principles of Leave no Trace are:<br/>
<br/>
- Plan Ahead and Prepare <br/>
- Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces <br/>
- Dispose of Waste Properly <br/>
- Leave What You Find <br/>
- Minimize Campfire Impacts <br/>
- Respect Wildlife <br/>
- Be Considerate of Other Visitors <br/>
<br/>
I would add one about being conscious and respectful of the plants <br/>
and vegetation in the area where you are, particularly endangered <br/>
species.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think that "Leave no Trace" necessarily means to leave no <br/>
evidence that you were there, rather leave no negative evidence or <br/>
impact.  Consider wildlife in the woods...  we have all seen deer <br/>
paths and branches that have been broken by large animals passing <br/>
through an area.  Nature is meant to be enjoyed in a hands-on way and <br/>
has the ability to repair itself from use and minor damage.  It just <br/>
takes common sense and respect and a knowledge of your surroundings <br/>
and their significance (in all seasons).  What is okay one place or <br/>
during one season of the year, may not be okay at another.<br/>
<br/>
There is a fine line between placing a box too near a trail that it <br/>
will more than likely be discovered accidentally, and placing it so <br/>
far out in the woods that significant off-trail walking must be <br/>
done.  It is nearly impossible for 10 people to walk off trail to a <br/>
letterbox in the woods and leave no trace, even though each single <br/>
individual probably did leave no trace.  I have noticed paths to <br/>
boxes that have been found by only a handful of individuals.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As I letterbox with my homeschooled son, I am able to turn the experience<br/>
into a lesson on LNT every time (in addition to the dozen or so other things<br/>
to be learned from letterboxing). A time that comes to mind is when we were<br/>
tracking down a box inside a local botanical garden. We had just left<br/>
another garden, deciding that the clues would take us too far out into the<br/>
plants for us to continue without damage. At the second garden, we stood<br/>
there on the edge of the grass field it indicated to cross, just staring at<br/>
the expanse of green and looking for a sign or something that said it was<br/>
alright to walk there. In the end, we asked a volunteer at the garden who<br/>
told us it was fine. Point being, I think that every step of the way,<br/>
whether placing boxes or finding them, we need to stay aware of what we are<br/>
doing to the world. Leave no trace behind is a great overriding concept, but<br/>
it is nearly impossible to implement. If the dirt is soft, you leave<br/>
footprints behind as my ds pointed out to me one day. So we try for leaving<br/>
almost no trace behind by watching where we walk, where we hunt and being<br/>
willing to walk away when clues seem to encourage us to do environmental<br/>
harm.<br/>

&gt; clues so vague you are forced to look under every rock and behind<br/>

<br/>
I beg to differ with this point.  No text forces anyone to do anything.<br/>
<br/>
(Personally, if I can't find the box in 30 seconds or so from what the<br/>
text, environment, and internal codes offer, I move on.  Hoepfully I've<br/>
enjoyed the place and the text already enough).<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say that the point is not a good one -- try make the last <br/>
part of the clue _crystal clear to someone who has solved the text_, and<br/>
if _you can't solve the text_, _move on_ -- but don't ascribe texts to <br/>
have powers that they don't.<br/>

&gt; &gt; clues so vague you are forced to look under every rock and behind<br/>
&gt; &gt; every tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I beg to differ with this point.  No text forces anyone to do <br/>
anything.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Personally, if I can't find the box in 30 seconds or so from what <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; text, environment, and internal codes offer, I move on.  Hoepfully <br/>
I've<br/>
&gt; enjoyed the place and the text already enough).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's not to say that the point is not a good one -- try make the <br/>
last <br/>
&gt; part of the clue _crystal clear to someone who has solved the <br/>
text_, and<br/>
&gt; if _you can't solve the text_, _move on_ -- but don't ascribe texts <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; have powers that they don't.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...I will make no friends with this post...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Lest this turn into a flame war, let's stay brief and polite<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;on this thread.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Congrats, I generally agree.  It's a contradiction in terms<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;to leave no trace, *except* the box we are leaving behind :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;As a past boy scout, I wouldn't worry about LNT ethics, as we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;used to cut switches from green limbs, right off the trees,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;burn whatever we could find and left behind biodegratable waste.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Letterboxers in general seem to be less invasive then we were.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Pragmatically, I take LNT to mean don't break anything, don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;do anything to put furry woodland creatures out of their homes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and generally leave it the way you found it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;In the big picture, I take comfort in knowing the rangers did<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;more than I will ever do by paving parking lots :-)<br/>
