Yo Chuck<br/>
Trust in Molly,  if she can find my car keys in deep snow three days<br/>
after I lost them. then she could have found that box--no problem.<br/>

&gt; You know that a letterbox is camouflaged well if you put it down in<br/>
&gt; the open and can't find it. I camouflaged a letterbox today by<br/>
&gt; painting it before planting. I put it down to get other things ready<br/>
&gt; for my box planting trip. Next thing you know, I lost it. Didn't<br/>
&gt; remember where I put it and walked by it several times before<br/>
&gt; Chickabirdie found it for me. Guess the camouflage worked. I thought<br/>
&gt; it was pretty funny.<br/>
<br/>
LOL. My signature stamp is very well camouflaged, then. I ought to figure<br/>
out some way to put it on a lanyard so I don't wind up playing "find the<br/>
stamp" in the dead leaves.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Should have had Molly find it for me.<br/>
<br/>
I thought she was a lab, not a boxer? Har har har....<br/>
