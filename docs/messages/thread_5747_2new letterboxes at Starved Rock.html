</p><p> Matt, 
</p><p>I'm trying a new route for posting my clues.  Maybe you would like to try them next time your in the area.  I think I have the direction now for your first box, I'm still working on it.  The weather here has been very wet.  I'll let you know when I find it.
</p><p>Thanks for the help!

<p>Name of Letterbox: Starved Rock Lodge #1</p>

<p>1. There are 23 chainsaw Wood Carvings at the Lodge. Start at the only one that was carved by Peter "Wolf" Toth in 1989.</p>
<p>*Hint: Go to the front desk in the Lodge and receive the Art in the Park brochure. Save the brochure, it will come in handy.</p>
<p>2. Proceed westbound on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>3. Lounge with the "Stargazer" and follow his right.</p>
<p>4. Not the Lodge,</p>
<p>Not the Hotel</p>
<p>Go toward,</p>
<p>Tonti and DeLaSalle</p>
<p>5. Pass DeLaSalle, at the T take a right.</p>
<p>6. Go over the flagstones and onto the bricks.</p>
<p>7. Go smooth to the East when you greet the man at the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>8. Of all the entryways find the one with the shape of "Land of Lincoln"</p>
<p>Enter. Beware it may be hidden underneath.</p>
<p>9. Have a seat with the 2 brown bears. Look 45 degrees to the right.</p>
<p>10. Its not in the cupboard,</p>
<p>Or behind a door.</p>
<p>Use your best guess,</p>
<p>And open a drawer.</p>

<p>On the veranda under your feet,</p>
<p>There is a stone so very unique.</p>
<p>It points to a view that can not be beat,</p>
<p>So take a walk or a drive, youll need to take a peak!</p>
<p>A quarter is the fee,</p>
<p>Eighteen point five is the key.</p>
<p>Across where the Bald Eagles feed,</p>
<p>Its in the building behing the four-fifty.</p>
<p>Driving is required to find the man,</p>
<p>He wears a fedora because he can.</p>
<p>Remember our previous plan,</p>
<p>And search in the building for the number at hand.</p>
