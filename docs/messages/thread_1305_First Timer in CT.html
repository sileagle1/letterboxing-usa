New to letterboxing, new to this list. I'm wondering how many people in <br/>
Connecticut have "gotten the bug" as a result of that recent article in the <br/>
Hartford Courant...well, you can count me among 'em! Today (a bright, sunny <br/>
autumn Sunday) was my first time out, and I'm pleased to report that I found <br/>
three letterboxes. Persistence (and following directions VERY carefully) <br/>
seems to be the key to letterboxing success.<br/>
<br/>
I'm surprised at the lack of letterboxes in western CT (LItchfield Hills <br/>
area), given its very rural character. What can we do to persuade you eastern <br/>
CT letterbox planters to come out to this end of the state and do your magic? <br/>
Me, I'm still too new at all this to even contemplate planting boxes around <br/>
here...for now, I'm just sticking to trying to find 'em.<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt;   My daughter and I found our first letterbox on a gorgeous Indian <br/>
&gt; Summer day yesterday.  We saw the Hartford Courant article and have <br/>
&gt; just been waiting for our first opportunity.  My daughter, who is 9, <br/>
&gt; was very excited about carving a stamp, and we did that right away.  <br/>
&gt; We chose the "Gryffindor Tower" letterbox to be sure to keep her <br/>
&gt; interest since she is somewhat new to hiking. Even though the hike <br/>
&gt; was a little tougher than we originally envisioned, we were <br/>
&gt; definitely rewarded.  Hello to the letterboxers we met on the trail <br/>
&gt; on the way down!  Hope you found the letterbox okay!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ski-Shell and her mom,<br/>
&gt; Found: One, but definitely not the last!  <br/>
