have been planning.  Now with the snow and the cold weather it may be<br/>
several weeks before they can be found.  Speaking as someone who loves snow<br/>
the 4 -5 inches we have gotten just aren't enough, even though it does put<br/>
the crimp on letterboxing...<br/>
<br/>
These spots are three of our favorite in the area.  I hope everyone else<br/>
enjoys them as well.<br/>

Here they are:<br/>
<br/>
Ryan Park<br/>
North Kingstown, RI<br/>
"Afternoon on the Amazon"<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - Easy, a beautiful 1+ mile walk crossing Belleville Pond in one<br/>
of the town parks.  The pond is very shallow and has water lilies growing on<br/>
it in the summer.  It has a special manmade treat in the center that you<br/>
will visit in your pursuit of the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take Rt 4 to Oak Hill Rd.  From the north Oak Hill will be a<br/>
left turn at the first stop light.  From the south it will be a right turn<br/>
at the second light.  Take the 2nd entrance to Ryan Park on your left.  If<br/>
you hit Rt 1 you have gone too far.  When the road forks go left and follow<br/>
the directions to the boat launch and park. <br/>
