<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This one is probably short-lived, because it's in a 
very public park and not very hidden.   But, the stamp didn't turn out 
as well as I'd hoped either, so... Hey, it was an excuse to explore a park that 
I hadn't been to before! *sheepish grin*</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, I planted a letterbox at Forest River Park 
in Salem, MA.  It's the first of a series that I'd like to do, 
commemorating the men and women who were accused during the Salem "Witch" Trial 
hysteria.  (My husband's ancestors were on both sides of the 
gallows.)  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For the very easy clues, see my 
webpage:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.aisling.net/lb/MA/salem.htm">http://www.aisling.net/lb/MA/salem.htm</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>(If you can't find it, then it's already 
missing.  I'll find a better hiding spot for the next one.  
Really.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is in a park with gorgeous water views, a 
small beach, swimming pools, picnic tables, multi-laned kiddie slides, swing 
sets, and there were plenty of pets on leashes there, too.  And, although 
the sign says "no charcoal fires," the BBQs were cooking anyway.  Oh, the 
aromas!  (Yes, I drove directly to Brothers' Deli in Salem after hiking, I 
was that hungry for some shishkebab! *grin*)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Forest River Park is right next to the living 
history museum, the Salem 1630 Pioneer Village.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
<div>Ais </div></body></html>
