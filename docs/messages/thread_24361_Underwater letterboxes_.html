do it) but have not come up with a great solution.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my thoughts:<br/>
<br/>
a) People already seem to have a hard enough time putting back together<br/>
above-water boxes (i.e. sealing up the ziplock bags, putting stuff back in<br/>
as they found it, etc<br/>
<br/>
b) People seem to have a hard enough time putting the box back into it's<br/>
hiding spot at all.<br/>
<br/>
c) Noting a) and b), my faith that an underwater box would be properly<br/>
re-packed and re-placed is low.   I would hate to see the box become<br/>
water-logged, and the log book ruined.<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts were on a box that was sunken, and hauled out via a rope.   This<br/>
means that it's got to have no airspace left within, and needs to be full of<br/>
something heavy.   I didn't want a buoyant box b/c I didn't want others<br/>
accidentally discovering it.<br/>

 I've seen temporary boxes at the end of a line in a pond and a night event box planted on a dock with glow sticks.?? I've discussed planting some along Darby creek and a couple of islands on Hargus lake accessible only by kayak or canoe but they are not likely to have many visitors.? You would just need to attach the box to a brick or use a larger lock and lock with concrete in the bottom third or so.? Fisherman would probably snag the line if tied to shore if care is not taken.? Unless we are talking SCUBA here.<br/>

These containers wouldn't solve the bouyancy problem, but in mid-<br/>
Missouri the waterproof container of choice is the lock 'n lock...it <br/>
easily withstood the rigorous scientific testing we subjected it to, <br/>

There are some really terrific water proof containers such as Pelican <br/>
boxes or Zero Boxes, but unfortunately they are really pricey. I have <br/>
run some surprise unofficial tests on both brands here on the Kern <br/>
River as well as some other rivers.  A war surplus ammo can would work <br/>
for a while, if you found one with good seals, but in the long run <br/>
someone may not close it properly. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found one in Oklahoma several years ago.  It was inside some kind <br/>
of waterproof bag with a rock to weigh it down, attached to a rope <br/>
hanging from a dock in a small pond.  The clues said nothing about <br/>
where it was, just go to the end of the dock, so was fun to figure it <br/>
out.  It was dependant on each finder resealing the bag correctly, so <br/>
a waterproof box would be good for redundancy.<br/>
<br/>
I have thought about placing a box for snorklers in shallow water so <br/>
you could get to dry land to stamp in.  I thought about using <br/>
threaded PVC pipe with caps on each end to house the log and stamp.  <br/>
I figure if PVC is made to contain water without leaking, it should <br/>
keep water out, too.  Just not sure how it would last in salt water <br/>
and exposure to sun.  If it was in fresh water in shade, it might <br/>
work.  Of course, it would eventually get green and slimy, but maybe <br/>
that could be the theme of the box.  Beware the Green Slime!<br/>

It was BindleBabe of Michigan who placed it.  She hid it off the shore <br/>
of Milwaukee, WI  and you are correct it required a dive.  I was sorry <br/>
my dad was no longer among the living so he could retrieve it for me.  <br/>
If I remember correctly, it was first found by a geocacher, even though <br/>
it was a letterbox.  Not sure what the current status is...<br/>

I was musing about how to overcome the bouyancy factor.  Part of it would be putting weights inside the box, and the other would be putting it under a rock.  Methinks some tests are in order.....<br/>

Here it is.Good ol' internet search....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Buoyancy is a factor of the weight of the water being displaced by the object.If the object weighs less than the volume of water it displaces, the object has positive buoyancy, and will float.If the object weighs more than the volume of water it displaces, the object has negative buoyancy, and will sink.If the object weighs the same as the volume of water it displaces, then it has neutral buoyancy.The total downward force is the weight of the object, and the total upward force is the weight of the water displaced.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So all I have to do to figure out how much ballast to use is to figure out the volume of water displaced, and then figure out the weight of?that amount of?water.That number of pounds (I'm using lead fishing sinkers for ballast; gravel just doesn't cut it), plus the weight of the container itself should be more than enough to keep it on the bottom.<br/>

Hey, Pakrat,,,<br/>
<br/>
You can figure out the weight, etc. and keep it on the bottom,,, IF <br/>
it's non-moving water... if it has a current, it may tend to bobble, <br/>
if the weight isn't sufficient... I'm guessing you're going to have <br/>
it tethered with something so it won't head off towards an ocean, if <br/>
it IS moving water...  :-)<br/>

I'm getting good results, but I still need to tweak the volume to ballast ratios.I'll let you know.There must be some mathematical formula out there that'll tell me this without having to do this trial and error stuff.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was looking for some unrelated stuff at an outdoor outfitter site<br/>
and stumbled upon a product called Aloksak. These are waterproof bags<br/>
that are advertised to stay dri to a depth of 200 feet. I'm not sure<br/>
I'd rely solely on one of these, but they might work inside another<br/>
container, and they could conceivably be loaded with ballast. Here's a<br/>
link to what I believe is the manufacturer's site. There are different<br/>
sizes, and options to purcchase sets of mixed sizes. The price doesn't<br/>
seem too bad, considering the product claims. Check out this site:<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The volume of water (and thus, the weight) also depends on the temperature.?When water gets colder and freezes it expands, which could throw off the formula somewhat. When dealing with buoyancy issues, you generally?have to be more precise than that (re: a pound a pint). It works out to 1.0425 pounds per pint. If you're talking about a little thing like a letterbox it probably doesn't matter, but that .0425 pound would certainly add up if we're talking about big stuff like submarines.<br/>
