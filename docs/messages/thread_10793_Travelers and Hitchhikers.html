&gt; &gt; I'm new to this. What's a personal traveler?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A traveler is a stamp carried by a letterboxer for the purposes<br/>
&gt; of making an exchange.  It is not a letterbox (typically) (for those<br/>
&gt; who care, it would count as an X, not an F or (gag :-)) an HH.  It<br/>
&gt; allows you to keep your personal stamp secret (collecting personal<br/>
&gt; stamps in logbooks (and exposing them) is taboo in some parts of<br/>
&gt; the world).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The traveler is an imported tradition.  I'm not sure if the adding<br/>
&gt; of a requirement to see it is a Yank invention or not (I did this<br/>
&gt; on my box called "Traveler", which, since it is actually a letterbox<br/>
&gt; and not actually a traveler seemed to need a riddle -- I'm not sure<br/>
&gt; if people copied that or the idea is ancient or invented elsewhere --<br/>
&gt; I believe, tho, that traditional travelers are _not_ clue'd -- my<br/>
&gt; traveler is not clue'd).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hitchhikers and travelers are completely different and unrelated<br/>
&gt; things.  Often the words are confused, and people are free to mix<br/>
&gt; and match syntax, semantics, and semiotics as much as they wish,<br/>
&gt; but the explanation above represents "traditional" usages.<br/>

Although I love the idea of secret signature stamps, most of us are <br/>
avidly exchanging them and sign into letterboxes with stamp and name. <br/>
You shoulda seen the frenzy at Moose Hill last month! We even wear <br/>
little nametags with the stamp image instead of our name. Putting <br/>
faces with the stamps we've seen in the field is great fun. No <br/>
secrets there!<br/>
<br/>
So for the two or three years I've been carrying a traveler, I've <br/>
told people to count it as an "F," not an "X." And, I've counted all <br/>
the travelers I've been lucky enough to find as f's as well.<br/>
<br/>
Just another example of the flexibility and individuality of this <br/>
amazing past time. The few people who keep the mysterious fun alive <br/>
add immeasurably to the intrigue and fascination of letterboxing, and <br/>
are truly more Dartmoorian than the whole open/internet Yankness <br/>
we've evolved here.<br/>
