A traveller is a separate stamp that a boxer might carry but doesn't stamp<br/>
into logbooks with.  A signature stamp is used to stamp into the logbooks.<br/>
A traveller, aka personal traveller, is a stamp that's carried with you that<br/>
other boxers can request should they happen to meet you on the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Some people that carry personal travellers expect a person requesting it to<br/>
answer some sort of riddle or question, others just give it to the person<br/>
they meet if the person simply requests it.  And you just stamp it into your<br/>
logbook.  I hike with two travellers.  One pertains to the most important<br/>
food in all the world -- chocolate.  The other pertains to the most<br/>
important chocolate in all the world -- M&amp;Ms.<br/>

&gt; What's the difference between a traveler and a<br/>
&gt; hitchhiker?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
If I understand it right, traveler is the term used in England for what we <br/>
call a hitchhiker.   LbNA also uses that term for what's called a hitchhiker in <br/>
common usage on this continent.<br/>
<br/>
The confusion comes in because of the similarity in name with Personal <br/>
Travelers, which are what Mosey described.<br/>

can now list the travellers they've found and released at the website, so<br/>
that website is obviously using the term to be synonymous with hitchhiker.<br/>
I've never done it that way.  The folks that I learned boxing from had very<br/>
strict meanings for each term.  And the term "traveller" only means<br/>
*personal* traveller.  But it reads like the LbNA website uses it to mean<br/>
anything and everything that's not tied down.  :-)<br/>
