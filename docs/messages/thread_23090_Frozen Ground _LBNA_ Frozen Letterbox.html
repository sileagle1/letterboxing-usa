one day when i was out LBing, i past an area where there was a LB. i <br/>
thought that i would check on it and make sure the condition of the <br/>
box was good. this box was in the ground under a rock and i couldn't <br/>
get the rock up. i had steel toed boots on and kicked the rock as <br/>
hard as i could and the rock never moved. i'm hoping no one goes <br/>
looking for that box because they maybe very dissappointed when they <br/>
get there. thank god i found it in the summer. with the weather <br/>
being so warm this winter, i was surprised to find the ground so <br/>
hard and the rock so unmovable. the joy of LBing in the winter.<br/>

&gt; Had a similar experience in CT.  Had to peel off paper towels from <br/>
several stamps in a series.  Soooo  cold in CT today,,,<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; After walking  about 2.5 miles, it was about 15 degrees on top of<br/>
&gt; Mountain. Letterbox was in place but wrapped in frozen plastic bag <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; decided not to open it up to check it out. Will be back to check <br/>
it out<br/>
&gt; when the weather is warmer.<br/>
