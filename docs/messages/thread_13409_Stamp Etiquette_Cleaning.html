The little stamp savers that Chris is talking about are a great <br/>
idea.  I have been making them out of posterboard, old gift boxes and <br/>
old file folders.  I recently tried using the thin craft foam and <br/>
that works great also.  Once you've done a couple and get the hang of <br/>
it, it will take only 5-10 minutes to make one.  With the posterboard <br/>
ones, I fold a tiny square of paper toweling in the bottom to blot <br/>
the ink.  They sure help to keep the inside of the box clean!<br/>
<br/>

and click on "stamp savers" (you will need to have MS-Word and have <br/>

&gt; Has anyone besides me begun to use old socks to put stamps in when <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; plant?  I saw someone at a Mass gathering this winter with their <br/>
stamp in a<br/>
&gt; sock<br/>

I now<br/>
&gt; have a<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; scent (I'm sure it would probably help the famous Molly find<br/>
more <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; :-o ), but I don't know if wild critters would be drawn to it<br/>
or <br/>
&gt; &gt; repelled by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it. Even if you wash the socks in an unscented detergent, feet<br/>
&gt; &gt; being the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stinky things they are will leave a scent (actually any clothes<br/>
&gt; &gt; will, just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ask any Police dog) :-).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Franzsolo and I (separately, but at the same time) came up with<br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; design for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Stamp protectors that are very easy to make out of poster board<br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; soft thin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; foam. They protect the stamp in it's own little 'container' and<br/>
&gt; &gt; help absorb<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the excess ink and keep it off the baggie and other box<br/>
contents.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; SpringChick did a great job of demonstrating how to make them<br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; even had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; supplies and directions for everyone at the GL gathering. If<br/>
she <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; not able<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to share the directions with those that are interested, I can<br/>
&gt; scan <br/>
&gt; &gt; in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; copy (with her permission of course) and send it as an<br/>
attachment <br/>
&gt; &gt; to whom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ever requests it. Seems that would solve some of the problems<br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; negate the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; need for socks, paper towels, stamp cleaners, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just my 2 cents,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Has anyone besides me begun to use old socks to put stamps in<br/>
&gt; when <br/>
&gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; plant?  I saw someone at a Mass gathering this winter with<br/>
their <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sock<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (wish I could give that clever person the credit for the idea!)<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; I now<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; use for all the slightly worn socks my boys generate.  I have<br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp in one and have used them in boxes which need new paper<br/>
&gt; &gt; towels.  Is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; good or not so good idea?<br/>
