&gt;  Lets say for example that a box expires (so to speak) if the "owner"<br/>
&gt;  removes it, its notified missing, or ....say three years have passed.<br/>
&gt;  Then it can only be an orphan for a maximum of three years...<br/>
&gt;  If its owner regularly maintains it..eg once a year..or takes it in for<br/>
&gt;  winter ..er grazing...then it can be re-flagged again..else it expires...<br/>
&gt;  Does that make some kind of sense ?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it does.  Keep this in the front of your brain, would you, and<br/>
remind me of it again later when it comes up?  I have (i hate this<br/>
phrase) a lot on my plate right now...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On the subject of orphan letterboxes:  So far I have been able to keep tabs to<br/>
some degree on all my boxes.  I DO have intentions of placing some boxes,<br/>
however, in remote places that I may never return to.  I see such boxes (as<br/>
Linda suggested) to be little time capsules.  (and we might be surprised to<br/>
find that our time capsules are discovered sooner than we imagined.)<br/>
<br/>
I won't feel guilty about placing orphan boxes.  There is always a certain<br/>
amount of doubt about whether a box is still out there.  Dealing with the<br/>
unknown is part of the game.  Even if I check my letterboxes regularly, there<br/>
is still a possibility that one could come up missing some day, and that<br/>
someone will go looking for it soon afterward and not be able to find it.  The<br/>
best they can do is contact our organization and let us know of their<br/>
experience.  Hopefully, the original box owner will see the report and take<br/>
the initiative to go out and check on it.<br/>
<br/>
It is my hope that clues to any such remote boxes would not expire after a few<br/>
years.  If they are truly remote, it may be several years before anyone makes<br/>
it out to where they are.  I know I'm not the only one who has letterboxes<br/>
that have been out there for nearly a year, already, without having been<br/>
found.  I find the prospect of going on an expedition for a ten year old<br/>
mystery box to be very intriguing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we can't depend on a designation in the clues to indicate orphan boxes.<br/>
When I place a box, I may not intend for it to be an orphan.  I might keep<br/>
track of it for a while, but then get busy with other things, or move away<br/>
from the area, or crawl under a rock and disappear.<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if there could ever be a way for us to briefly log our finds<br/>
into a database that is linked to our clue/map pages.  Maybe eventually (I<br/>
know Dan, like myself, has a proverbial platefull) it would be possible to<br/>
view an activity log for each letterbox.  The log might indicate the date that<br/>
the box was placed, and any known finds of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, in the year 2019, if I decide to go looking for a letterbox that was<br/>
placed in 1999 and has not been officially pronounced dead (but has not been<br/>
found, either) at least I will know what I'm getting into.  I might even want<br/>
to specialize in searching for long-lost, forgotten letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if I see that the box has had numerous visitors in recent<br/>
history, I will feel confident that I have a good chance of an easy find.<br/>
Such a log would also help us appreciate if we have found a box that is<br/>
considered "difficult".  If I find a "Mapsurfer" box that has been out there<br/>
for several years and has seldom (if ever) been visited, I will have a pretty<br/>
good idea that I have solved a riddle that others have failed to solve.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would also be possible to indicate that you had searched for a box,<br/>
but had been unable to find it.  Another log entry option might be to indicate<br/>
that the original owner has confirmed that the box was missing, and has<br/>
replaced it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe one of our techno-wizards can confirm if such an idea is feasible.<br/>

Then how about a special listing for those<br/>
boxes that have a 3-year expiration without<br/>
any recent updates. These boxes could have<br/>
a different status - like "unknown". Special<br/>
status could give them a bit more appeal,<br/>
especially if we were ever to have something<br/>
like the Dartmoor 100. In that case the special<br/>
unknown status boxes (that aren't officially<br/>
orphaned) could garner 2 points instead of one?<br/>
I'm just rambling again. I do like the idea that<br/>
we look out for each other's boxes when<br/>
given the opportunity. Incentive always works<br/>
too.<br/>

Yep, I agree.  I want to keep what we do on the web minimal.  The web <br/>
is a very nice thing to use for sharing clues and maps, but our best<br/>
bet I think is to keep it somewhat divorced from the "field".  I think<br/>
adding one entry for date of most recent find will probably suffice.<br/>
