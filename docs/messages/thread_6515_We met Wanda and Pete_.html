                    <html><body>As you may know, Darrin and I are fairly new to letterboxing, getting involved during this past Memorial Day weekend.  Anyway, we were letterboxing in the Mansfield area looking for the Mansfield 300 stamps which Leader of the Pack wonderfully hid in the area.  We drove up to the site of the Peep Letterbox and noticed a car with Rhode Island LP on it!  We immediately thought of Wanda and Pete and watched them enter the woods.  We traveled in behind them and introduced ourselves!  We had a lovely chat about letterboxes in the area, and are still dumbfounded that they are close to finding their 1300th letterbox!  We also exchanged stamps and stamped into the Peep Letterbox at the same time.
<br/>
<br/>What a great surprise!  Thanks Wanda and Pete for making our day extra special!

only time for one or two myself, so just let me say that we, too, <br/>
were thrilled to meet fellow letterboxers Pam and Darrin at the Peep <br/>
Study LB at UConn the other day! As much fun as it is to exchange <br/>
stamp images with other letterboxers at LB Gatherings and such, <br/>
meeting folks "out in the wild" while actually letterboxing - which <br/>
has only happened to us a half dozen or so times - is even better!<br/>
So here's to chance encounters and special visits!<br/>
