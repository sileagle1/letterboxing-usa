Isosceles, I think maybe you misunderstood my question.<br/>
<br/>
When I made my first letterbox, I checked on it like every week.  It <br/>
never failed to amaze me that someone took interest in MY box and had <br/>
the courtesy to stop by and visit it.  It was such a pleasure to get <br/>
a new stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
However, my box kept getting ruined from the get-go . . . vandalized, <br/>
floods, etc.  My precious stamp-ins!!!  SO I began to tear out any <br/>
fresh log-ins and take them home for their assured safety (I'm not so <br/>
emotionally connected to them nowadays).<br/>
<br/>
I just think each log-in is so special.  When someone takes the time <br/>
to search out a box (searching for the clues and expending the effort <br/>
on foot to track it down), I don't know, it just seems a shame not to <br/>
recognize all the visits each box gets.<br/>
<br/>
It's not a big deal.  I was just wondering if everybody counts them <br/>
in some way that I might be missing out on.  Please nobody think I'm <br/>
being over the top for my curiosity.  <br/>

It might be practical to count your finds if all your boxes are nearby<br/>
and in limited numbers.  I have over 150 boxes spread across 26<br/>
different states and 6 countries, and I'd be pretty hard-pressed to do<br/>
a count of log ins.  Just not practical!<br/>

I take my digital camera with me when I go on maintenance visits, to<br/>
record all the LB logs. That way if something goes wrong (the LB gets<br/>
stolen or waterlogged) I have a record of the pages.<br/>
