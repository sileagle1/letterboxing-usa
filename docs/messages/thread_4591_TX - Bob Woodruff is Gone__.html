<br/>
We are visiting the Dallas area this weekend and thought we'd hit at <br/>
least this box. Discovered there are many changes since the clues <br/>
were written. First bridge is not there, 2nd bridge has black <br/>
handrails now but worst of all, there was a flood (we looked it up at <br/>
the library) in the park a month ago and the box could not be found. <br/>
It may be there actually, but the table-like structure mentioned at <br/>
the end of the clues was not to be found so we didn't really know <br/>
where to start looking. There's a lot of downed trees and debris from <br/>
the flood so even if the structure was there, don't know if we would <br/>
have found the box anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that this box can be recovered and replanted nearby! We may be <br/>
back in the area and would love to find it.<br/>
