                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks so much for all the advice. I will start using DEET bugspray <br/>
on all of us. We actually did put some kind of repellant on us <br/>
(don't have it in front of me, so can't remember what it <br/>
is...something my husband used in the Middle East) but I didn't put <br/>
too much on DD for fear of the strength of the product and of her <br/>
putting her hands in her mouth.<br/>
<br/>
I took her to the doctor and he pulled the second tick and is <br/>
sending it to Public Health for them to do a test on it. He said <br/>
it's very unlikely that the ticks in Virginia will have Lyme <br/>
Disease, but PH wanted to test it to be sure. That makes me feel <br/>
good that they're willing to check.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I liked the idea about spraying the kids' hair with repellant. <br/>
She has tons of long hair and I really don't look forward to trying <br/>
to root through it all to look for a dot the size of a pin head. :)<br/>
<br/>
We're going searching again this weekend and we'll have a dust cloud <br/>
like Pigpen's of DEET around us, haha.<br/>

You may want to braid up her hair or put it in a ponytail or put on a head band. Do they still do that or am I showing my age? Hat?<br/>

imbedded remove with a tweezer as indicated in a previous post. Wash <br/>
and use an antiiotic/first Aid creme and cover with a bandaid.   Tape <br/>
the tick to a white index card and note where on the body the tick <br/>
was found.  When I camp with the GS, we take a sharpie and circle the <br/>
area so that the parents know where the tick attached and can watch <br/>
that area.  We also give them the card.  If the girl has a reaction <br/>
they can take the tick card with the info to their DR and he can <br/>
examine the tick to determine a couse of action.  <br/>
