Went back and read the orignal post. Not to rain on Amber's parade too much but here is my <br/>
question. How does this involve new people in boxing? I f anyone needs "prizes" other than <br/>
the hike and the box maybe they should geo-cache. <br/>
Taking a picture of them holding the t-shirt? Why not just take a picture of them holding the <br/>
box? <br/>
Now the question of ink. Have you stamped on fabric before? Not as easy as one would think. <br/>
A tiny bit of moisture with a watercolor marker or dye ink pad and the shirt would become a <br/>
tie-dye mess.<br/>
OK, the horse is dead and the lemur has been flung.<br/>
