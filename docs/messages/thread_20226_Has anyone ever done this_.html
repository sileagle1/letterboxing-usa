a WOM box first and there was a little certificate from the placer; <br/>
it had the box name, and the image on it. It was very nice, and is <br/>
mounted in our logbook (we're on # 3 now).  <br/>
<br/>
We tend to stray away from including trinkets...personally we feel <br/>
thats more along the style of another hobby. As far as first finding <br/>
itself, we've only be the first finders twice, once WOM and once for <br/>
Steve's B-Day box. <br/>
<br/>
Good discussion topic though!<br/>

I have left things in the past but only at hard to get to boxes.  <br/>
Things like the LbNA patch or window sticker.  I wanted to get some <br/>
hiking staff metals for first finders but that didn't happen.  I <br/>
also ask the person that if they won't use it leave it for someone <br/>
that will.  Don't know if anybody has taken them since I haven't <br/>
been back to those boxes since I planted them.  Everytime I order <br/>
LbNA things I get a few extra to hide.  <br/>

I have also found boxes that had as first finder prizes: <br/>
A small blown-glass pig ( the placer of the box was Funhog) <br/>

you walked past the coffee shop on your way to the letterbox)<br/>
