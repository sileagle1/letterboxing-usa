Pequot Woods in Mystic (Groton) CT.  Aix Sponsa is the series that <br/>
these boxes are listed under on the LBNA web site.  Nice walk, fairly <br/>
dry this time of year and very few bug except for right at the duck <br/>
pond. A special note that these boxes were the premiere of our *NEW* <br/>
family stamp. Hand carved with Madras's picture in the center! We'll <br/>
still use the old ones for X's and the occasional box, but we love <br/>
the new stamp!<br/>
<br/>
First box was in good condition, ink was good, log book full (using <br/>
flip-side-of-the-page). Replaced the paper towel and baggie as the <br/>
stamp was loose in the box.  Second box was a bit tough to find, but <br/>
with all the Drew boxes...if you think you're in the right spot and <br/>
can't find it... you haven't gone far enough! The 3rd try, we got <br/>
it!  No ink, logbook not full, stamp was fine though.  Nice carvings <br/>
as always!<br/>
<br/>
Got out of the woods about 20:30 as the trail became very dim due to <br/>
the overhead. Had a nice chat with a Rana Catesbeiana at the pond <br/>
edge. Also had a TON of lovely lightning bugs with their chartruese <br/>
yellow/green glow marking the trail.  Saw a few red ones the other <br/>
night outside our condo, but just yellow tonight. What a fun trail <br/>
though! We're going back sometime in daylight to get the full <br/>
appreciation of the different groves of tree species. <br/>
