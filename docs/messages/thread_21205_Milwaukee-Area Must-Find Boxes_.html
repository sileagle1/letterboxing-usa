I'm going to Wisconsin for a long weekend (from Oregon) and I'd love <br/>
to try to visit a few letterboxes while I'm there!  I've been <br/>
checking out some clues on my own already, but if anyone wants to <br/>
recommend some of the best not-to-be-missed boxes in Washington, <br/>
Ozaukee or Waukesha counties that would be great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sunshine<br/>
<br/>
p.s.  I even have a new hitchhiker to release while I'm there...<br/>

are fun.  7 boxes, approximately a 6 mile hike.  If you're looking for some<br/>
shorter hikes, we've hidden some in Waukesha county, a few are new boxes<br/>
hidden within the last week or so.  We're planning to post clues for some<br/>
more in this area within the next week or so.<br/>

It really depends on when you'll be comin' through.  We just got<br/>
buried in 5-10" of fresh snow.  The problem with the CC county and<br/>
Weapons of Math Instruction Series (thanks for the plug WI Hiker)<br/>
right now is that the park that they are in will now have the trails<br/>
off limits to hikers as they will be groomed for CC skiing only.  The<br/>
rangers are very particular about keeping hikers off their groomed trails.<br/>
<br/>
The only indoor box available right now that I can think of is<br/>
Creative Writing: The Never Ending Story which is right next to the WI<br/>
HH Hostel, and (humbly speaking) is I think near the top of the "don't<br/>
miss" boxes of WI. (The REI box is temporarily down.)<br/>
<br/>
If you're coming in March, the PI Day series (available only in March)<br/>
is a quick series of 6 stamps that are "don't miss" boxes (again,<br/>
humbly speaking).  Hopefully we'll be done with the snow then too....<br/>
