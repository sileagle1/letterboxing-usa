&gt; I am not aware of any in Victoria (I hope there aren't, I'd hate to<br/>
&gt; think that I was in Victoria last weekend and didn't find one), but<br/>
&gt; there is one in Vancouver, BC.<br/>
<br/>
According to this list and the website, there are two in Vancouver; one<br/>
in Pacific Spirit Regional Park and one in Stanley Park.  I live in<br/>
North Vancouver, and after I allocate some time to look for those two,<br/>
I'll hide a few more around the Greater Vancouver area.  :)<br/>
