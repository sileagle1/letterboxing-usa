In late June, 2007, 4 letterboxes were planted in/near Norris, Tennessee, in<br/>
hopes of <br/>
introducing boxing in that community. Today, after inspection, three of<br/>
those boxes have <br/>
been destroyed with contents having been reported earlier to me as<br/>
scattered. The <br/>
remaining box required taking a compass bearing and may have been saved<br/>
because of that <br/>
minor technical factor. <br/>

because the area <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is just my own humble opinion, but I wouldn't let a few ill-intentioned muggles ruin your fun or ruin a whole town for LB placement. It seems the muggles there aren't too smart or don't want to bother to obtain or learn how to use a compass. If it were me, I would replant a few test boxes (nothing too special that you don't mind getting trashed). This time encrypt part of the clue too. I bet they'll stay. I had this problem in another area and whoever was trashing boxes was either too dumb or too lazy to try and decrypt vague and ciphered clues. So don't give up, muggles are easily outsmarted. <br/>
