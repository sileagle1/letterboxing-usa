                    <div class="plaintext-content">Both of these boxes may be inaccessible during the snow months (about <br/>
November through about May, depending.  Call ahead for conditions.), due to <br/>
road closures.  Also, be sure to check the Climber's Registration on your <br/>
way past for fire/seismic/eruption hazards, and don't even think about <br/>
climbing the whole mountain without a $15 permit.  (You don't need it for <br/>
these boxes).  The fine for not having one is steeper than the steepest of <br/>
trails.<br/>
<br/>
That said, the clues!<br/>
<br/>
Box Name:  Lahar Viewpoint<br/>
nearest town: Cougar<br/>
placed by/on: Eliza B/9-14-02<br/>
County: (either Cowlitz or Skamania, I'm not sure where it falls on the <br/>
county line thingee)<br/>
difficulty: clues and hike are very easy/child-friendly.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From Cougar, follow the 503 spur east to the <br/>
mountain.  (honestly, it's hard to miss a giant volcano.  Really.)  Follow <br/>
the signs that will have you turn left, then right to the first box <br/>
(below), and from there, on to Lava Canyon.  The Lahar Viewpoint is the <br/>
first on your right when you hit the Lahar area.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
Park by the kiosk that has you singing "row, row, row your boat" in your <br/>
head for the next four hours.  (Or maybe that's just me.  I'm <br/>
suggestible.)  Take the trail to your left as you look at all the pretty signs.<br/>
<br/>
At the first choice, go straight (30 degrees).  You'll pass a huge log <br/>
unearthed by mudflows from the eruption.  (In fact, the whole landscape is <br/>
pumice from the eruption of '81, but don't be a dork and take any of <br/>
it.  Leave no trace means not horking rocks, either.)  Follow the trail <br/>
until it goes just over a little "lip" of a hill, and curves sharply toward <br/>
the mountain.  Enjoy the view for three adult paces and notice the big rock <br/>
and small pines that are growing in front of you  (Well, the trees are, <br/>
anyway.  The rock's pretty much done growing.).  Under the tree at 320, <br/>
there's your treasure, under a few pumice stones.<br/>
<br/>
Be careful removing this one, this is a fragile landscape.<br/>
<br/>
BOX NAME:  A IS FOR.... (Washington Abecederian Series #1)<br/>
PLACED BY/ON: Eliza B/9-14-02<br/>
County: uh.   Cowlitz or Skamania<br/>
Nearest town: Cougar<br/>
Difficulty: clues and hike are easy, kid-friendly<br/>
<br/>
 From Cougar, follow 503 Spur to St. Helens.  Follow the sign for Ape <br/>
Caves, which requires a NW Forest Pass for parking (as do most of the <br/>
attractions in this vicinity these days -- it's worth investing in.).<br/>
<br/>
Go up the concrete path to the gaping mouth of the cave.  Behind you as you <br/>
face down into the abyss, is a sign letting you know that the trail is <br/>
maintained by some kind of Grotto.  Take that trail.<br/>
<br/>
Just past the two parallel, embedded logs, in the second stump on the left, <br/>
at the base in a hole and under one piece of bark and another of pumice, is <br/>
the Ape.   Don't worry, he doesn't bite.  But *I* do, if you don't use <br/>
caution putting this one back -- it's a well-travelled trail.  Take care <br/>
not to be discovered.<br/>
<br/>
Wimpy box hikes aside, after you get these two easy boxes, follow the signs <br/>
to Lava Canyon (about a mile or so past the Lahar Box).  I used to hike <br/>
this all the time when I lived in Portland, and thought it was the World's <br/>
Hardest Trail because of the grade (insane), the Indiana-Jones-Type <br/>
suspension bridge (utterly nuts), and the sixty-some-odd-foot ladder at the <br/>
end that takes you to the trail for Smith Creek and, ultimately, the PCT <br/>
(out of their friggin' minds)....and while I still think it's very hard, <br/>
it's a walk in the park compared to some of these letterbox hikes, and the <br/>
scenery is unparalleled in beauty/visual interest.  Don't take kids on the <br/>
hardest trail and watch 'em close -- this is a dangerous place due to the <br/>
1400+ feet of waterfalls (separated into a series that will leave you <br/>
breathless...).<br/>
<br/>
There'd be more letterboxes here, but I left them in the car.  *sigh*  Next <br/>
time....<br/>
