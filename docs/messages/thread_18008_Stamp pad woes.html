                    <div class="plaintext-content">As I recall from my years of medieval manuscript studies, the <br/>
principle constituents of ink are a pigment of some sort (oak gall <br/>
was popular in the 1400's) and a carrier, often gum arabic. I note <br/>
that gum arabic is still sold for just that purpose in art supply <br/>
shops, and wonder if a bottle might be a worthwhile investment?<br/>
<br/>
(Gums are also used in low-fat food products to create mouth-feel--<br/>
maybe you could test this theory by freezing some salad dressing, <br/>
then reconstituting with xanthan gum?)<br/>
<br/>
Interesting to note that the primary producer of gum arabic these <br/>
days is Sudan. Makes one wonder where those middle-aged monks got <br/>
theirs?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder, however, if the ink is the issue: might the freezing have <br/>
caused the pad itself to break down? They are rather sponge-like, and <br/>
I could easily imagine cells breaking from the expansion...<br/>
<br/>
And while I can appreciate your cynicism, I somehow think we might <br/>
excuse the ink pad manufacturers for not anticipating people leaving <br/>
their stamping supplies outside in freezing weather (or in the <br/>
freezer for that matter)! ;-)<br/>

<br/>
Oops--I wonder if this extra info will help point to a possible <br/>
solution to these ink pad woes (there are about 5 brand new full-<br/>
size dye-inkpads involved in this quandary--funny, it didn't happen <br/>
to the dozen 'cat eye' pigment ink pads nor the 15 various <br/>
paintbrush watercolour markers we also carried during these treks)?  <br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention that these 'problematic' tundra-suffering stamp <br/>
pads, were brand new stamp pads (3 color multi-ink pads) opened just <br/>
prior to the first sub-zero multi-day outing in Boise.  We <br/>
experienced said poorly stamping ink-pad 'woes' and then opened <br/>
another brand new ink-pad specifically for our East Coast stamping <br/>
travels (or rather stamping 'travails' in this case?) a few weeks <br/>
later (presuming that the first experience was just the result of a <br/>
one-time 'lemon' stamp pad).  **Granted, our very first LBing ink <br/>
pad was made by the same company, same ink colors, everything the <br/>
same down to a 'T' as these 'problematic' ink pads and the first one <br/>
lasted over an entire year visiting/placing several hundred boxes in <br/>
the process without any problems.  It ultimately retired to ink pad <br/>
heaven due to an unfortunate lack of ink!!!**<br/>
<br/>
Each time, after the ink pad went through the freeze/thaw cycle, the <br/>
stamps (our signature stamps carved on PZ-Kut) literally 'stuck' not <br/>
only to the pad itself but also to the logbook/paper upone which we <br/>
impressed the image.  Bizarre!  This occurred even when stamping the <br/>
image indoors after the ink pad was given ample time to thaw (hours <br/>
&amp; hours).<br/>
<br/>
The resulting image wasn't even remotely the colour of the original <br/>
ink-pad colour--it was like deeper/lighter 'blotches' of a similar <br/>
shade with portions of the stamp not even getting any ink from the <br/>
pad--although, when inspecting it 'after inking &amp; prior to <br/>
impressing' (what we affectionately refer to as the 'huff on the <br/>
stamp to remoisten the ink on the stamp' phase of stamping in) it <br/>
looked as if it had inked properly before we pressed it to the paper.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the inks with the worst problems were the pink &amp; purple shades.<br/>

Is this just life as it goes while letterboxing in frigid environs?  <br/>
I wonder how folks in Alaska (or Minnesota or Upstate New York or <br/>
insert freezing cold locale of your choice here...) deal with this...<br/>

Here in Upstate New York one thing we have learned is to layer our <br/>
clothes for the cold. In doing this it gives you many extra pockets <br/>
to put things in. As in ice fishing, keeping your bait worm, and un <br/>
frozen. This too works for stamp pads and stamps. If kept close to <br/>
your body heat they can't freeze. The short time that they are out <br/>
for use is not long enough for them to freeze. <br/>

<grin><br/>
<br/>
Seriously, keeping stamps and pads reasonably warm seems like a very <br/>
good idea. Between the stamp material, the ink, the gum arabic, and the <br/>
stamp pad material itself....... well, that's a lot of substances that <br/>
might not respond terribly well to being frozen, much less frozen and <br/>
unfrozen several times. Some things just react differently when too <br/>
cold or hot........<br/>

<br/>
Gum arabic is used with watercolors and gouache.  <br/>
You might want to try it, it is expensive.....but <br/>
then only a little bit is used when mixed with water.  <br/>
A.C.Moore and Michaels would have it in the artist <br/>

Have you tried "Perfect Ink Refresher"?  I found mine <br/>

about $5.00 for a 4 oz. spray bottle.<br/>

is 'suspended' in the ink formula, freezes/separates/thaws never to <br/>
remix similarly again--hence, the ensuing gloppy images.   No, I <br/>
haven't tried the perfect ink refresher--I've simply been buying new <br/>
ink pads assuming the 'thawed/gloppy' ones were ruined.  The pads <br/>
that suffered the worst problems were by Rubber Stampede, Crystal <br/>
Dye-based Ink pad ('fantasy' tri-colour pads).  These are my <br/>
favorite ink pads to use and up until this 'sub-zero' experience I <br/>
hadn't had any problems with them except that after time (several <br/>
months) the pad would come unglued from the container--nothing <br/>
Household Goop adhesive couldn't solve in a few seconds--without <br/>
causing problems to the ink.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the larger pigment ink pads suffer the same fate since <br/>
they make take longer to freeze when exposed to such frigid <br/>
conditions?  I personally hesitate to use pigment ink pads on the <br/>
trail because it takes aeons to dry (if ever) and it usually just <br/>
ruins my logbook because they seem to smear over time.  I haven't <br/>
had such problems with the Cat Eye little pigment ink pads (not sure <br/>
why they perform differently than the larger ink pads).  I did <br/>
purchase some pigment pad inker (1 oz bottle of ink) to use to <br/>
refresh a pad but I haven't tried it yet--partially because I'm <br/>
still hesistant to use the pigment style ink versus the dye-ink.  I <br/>
purchased it at Michael's and they only had the dye-ink version of <br/>
the pad inker in black--the other colour refills were pigment-inks.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever thought when we started letterboxing, we'd ever have a <br/>
discussion like this?  ;)<br/>

Thanks for all of your help!  See you on the letterboxing trails one <br/>
day...<br/>
