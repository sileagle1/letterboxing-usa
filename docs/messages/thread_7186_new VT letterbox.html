Man in Stone Letterbox<br/>
Date planted:  August 20, 2002<br/>
Nearest town:  Dorset, Bennington County, Vermont<br/>
Level of difficulty:  Easy<br/>
<br/>
A great place to picnic, especially during foliage season!<br/>
<br/>
On the horseless carriage path between Dorset and Manchester, a row of pearly white teeth stand, placed by man's hand.  <br/>
Park not on the road, but on the Kelly side.  <br/>
Read the history and note the date the quarry was first opened. <br/>
Under the bridge you must go, straight to the depths.  <br/>
Four steps down and turn 180 degrees, add the first and last number of the date previously mentioned and go this many steps to where Otto left his mark.  <br/>
Sight across the depths at 90 degrees to see a face, Otto?, staring back at you.  Turn right and make your way around the quarry.  <br/>
On your way, be sure to count the number of grooves cut in a large block of marble to free it from the earth's hold.  Note this number.  <br/>
Cross the outlet and follow the trail Otto may have walked so many years ago. <br/>
Find the face you saw before, Little Brother's on your right.  </div>
