I'm new to the list, but have been letterboxing for a month or so.  <br/>
So please forgive me if there is a rivalry between letterboxing and <br/>
geocaching that I am unaware of.  I happen to enjoy both, so Katie <br/>
and I, along with my Lab Rollie, placed a cache/letterbox in NH.  (It <br/>
is also our first attempt at stamp carving, thought I think it came <br/>
out pretty good)<br/>
<br/>
The geocache information is posted here: <br/>

<br/>
I have yet to write traditional letterbox directions, but I will tell <br/>
you it is most of the route that "Shorthand" is, (Courtesy of the <br/>
Drew Clan)  Just look for a larger pile of rocks at a point along the <br/>
trail that offers a good view of the bay, and you'll find it under <br/>
one of the rocks.  <br/>
<br/>
So-  If any of you are into geocaching, the coordinates will get you <br/>
there.  For the traditional letterboxers, It will be more of a hunt <br/>
until I can write something creative.  <br/>
<br/>
I welcome any comments!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a wonderful forum for a very cool "sport"!<br/>

Glad to have another box in New Hampshire. Let me know when you have written<br/>
the letterbox clues and I will post them on our VT/NH page.<br/>
