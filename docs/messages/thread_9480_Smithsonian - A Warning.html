<div>"It should go without saying that suspicious behaviour in a federal

seem like some old stick-in-the-mud, but I feel compelled to give a much 
stronger warning to those who would undertake to letterbox in places which are 
legitimate targets of terrorism.  The security personnel in 
these facilities are completely humorless, and are very much on the 
lookout for people engaged in activities which could easily be construed as 
nefarious by the casual observer, i.e. surreptitiously secreting a 35mm mini on 
the underside of the water fountain with Velcro in the Smithsonian 
Castle.  If you were caught doing so, you would certainly be held 
pending full verification of your explanation, or worse.   At the 
least, I intend to have Chief Curator, Lynda Roscoe Hartigan's name at the ready 
just in case when I go.</div></div>

<div>
<div>     Recently, I was contacted by the Smithsonian. 
  Seems that they, too, have been made aware of our presence by the Washington 
  Post article, and were pretty interested in what their April '98 article had 
  spawned. I believe that a follow up article, or blurb anyway, is in the works. 
  The most amazing thing is that the correspondent I talked with knew of the 
  first Kmartha prank, and was more than a little amused by my remarks about it 
  someday ending up in the Institution's archives of Americana. She passed the 
  joke on to one of the curators at the American Art Museum, who specializes in 
  American Folk Art. She was also charmed, and contacted me, inquiring about the 
  piece! </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>     I had a really interesting discussion with 
  her about folk art, and my take on the whole letterboxing thing. While I'd be 
  tickled to have any of my work as part of the collection, I convinced her that 
  such a piece should be dynamic, interactive, and discreet... a <em>real</em> 
  letterbox placed within the Smithsonian, that people could find, stamp in, 
  collect the stamp, and be part of it... after a time, it could be put on 
  display or added to the archives for future display. 
  <div></div>
<div></div>
<p>     So there it is. Your chance to be a small part of 
  history and folk art in America, not to mention a highly collectible piece of 
  legerdemaine. It'll be in place until the beginning of April, and then become 
  part of the Smithsonian archives. I'd like to thank Chief Curator, Lynda 
  Roscoe Hartigan, for allowing me, and the community, this once in a lifetime 
  opportunity, and specifically for being receptive to my suggestions regarding 
  how this be put forth. </p>
<div>     The letterbox is located in the Smithsonian 
  Castle.  Use the handicap entrance on the Washington Monument side of the 
  front entrance.  Note the old Smithsonian lamppost letterbox on display 
  directly to the right of the doorway when you enter.  The letterbox is a 
  35mm mini.  It is attached to the underside of the water fountain to 
  the left of the doorway with Velcro.  It should go without saying that 
  suspicious behaviour in a federal building will likely ruin your day, so 
  be discreet, and take it to a remote spot for stamping up, and return it 
  later. </div></div></div></div></div><br clear="all"/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to admit letterboxing inside "government" buildings does not <br/>
sound like a good idea.  In fact it could be disastrous leading to <br/>
too much scrutiny and publicity.  Security people are too nervous <br/>
about such places right now.<br/>
<br/>
Remember we thrive on a lot of people NOT knowing about us.  We want <br/>
people who are interested in the hobby and are discreet.  We don't <br/>
want so much publicity that we would start getting vandalized or shut <br/>
out. <br/>
