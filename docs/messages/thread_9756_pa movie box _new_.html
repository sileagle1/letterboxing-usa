Seen any good movies lately?  I thought Bond was pretty lame, tho "modern"<br/>
Bond fans will prolly like it (but Halle Berry as a Bond girl -- please --<br/>
not that she isn't attractive (but I don't think she's that talented), but <br/>
she just isn't a Bond girl ... (and John Cleese as Q, which you think would <br/>
work, doesn't, IMHO -- I guess I'm just too much of a die hard for the glory<br/>
days ... (I could go on and on on how they've ruined Bond, but to say on <br/>
topic we'll get back to my box ...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you've seen _Witness_ lately, and can find where a particular<br/>
scene took place, you can find mapsufer #63, which is in the PA Amish <br/>
Country, is rated 3 stars (but an easy 3 stars for me), with clues here:<br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box63.html<br/>
<br/>
And tonite we'll see _Lord of the Rings_, and come April try to drop a<br/>
box were a scene in that was shot ... (Ryan, want to to New Zealand ... :-))<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

   Ryan, I think you should take Randy up on this invite!<br/>
