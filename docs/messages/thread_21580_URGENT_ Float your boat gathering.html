Hi everyone,<br/>
I just spoke to a guy at Litbery Lake. Usually they don't take <br/>
reservations, but because we are so far ahead of everything they are <br/>
going to try to make an exception for us. Howerver I need to kind of <br/>
give them a number. If you even have slight chance that you may come <br/>
on Labor Day Weekend. I need to know. If everyone who suspects that <br/>
they may come I would really appreciate it. I am really looking <br/>
forward to this. I expecially need to know how many RV's because <br/>
they only have so many RV sites. They told me that they never turn <br/>
away Tents cause they can find room. Please everyone, this is going <br/>
to be a great weekend.<br/>
