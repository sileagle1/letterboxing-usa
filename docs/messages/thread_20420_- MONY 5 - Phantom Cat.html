Saturday was too nice a day to pass up a hunt in Buffalo for one of <br/>
JeLyBean's beautiful stamps. I noticed that noone had adopted it so I <br/>
new the chance of finding it was iffy at best. Although I'm quite (buy <br/>
not totally) sure we followed the clues accurately and were at the right <br/>
location for the box, we couldn't find it. The area looked like it had <br/>
flooded recently, so the box might be MIA. Does anyone recall seeing <br/>
this around lately? This is one of three I need to complete his series.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
