Thank you Trish - as someone who "volunteers" through the Metro <br/>
Parks I am offended by the tone of her message. While I do not <br/>
endorse anyone ruining the park - I worked very hard supporting the <br/>
recent millage to support them. We have a fifedom in the metro parks <br/>
and that should be brought to an end. This particular park is always <br/>
in the eye of the storm because of the costs to maintain it, while <br/>
it is the least used of the system.  How unfortunate that she chose <br/>
to answer this for herself and in her own words it should have come <br/>
from the "Executive Director of the Park District" Perhaps she <br/>
should rethink why she works for a department that is to serve and <br/>
educate the public about nature and it's benefits. She may have <br/>
forgotten that in order to show the public what the park system has <br/>
to offer you first have to get them to come out to the parks. (I <br/>
would think that they would be more worried about what goes on in <br/>
the parking lot at lunch time!?)<br/>
I have personal friends who are park rangers in three of the other <br/>
parks and they think it is a novel idea and that it might be better <br/>
handled by the park staff - they are in a position to make sure that <br/>
they would be in areas that would be considered "safe" for the park <br/>
and patrons. With their help I am drafting a letter to the Director <br/>
to make a plea for the introduction of such a program. <br/>
<br/>
Jumping off my soapbox now - thanks again Trish<br/>
