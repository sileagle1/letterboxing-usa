I've had it with these puerile "I'm unsubscribing" posts. Your <br/>
little fits mean nothing and most of you don't actually unsubscribe <br/>
or just re-subscribe under an alias. What do you think this sort of <br/>
childish behavior accomplishes? Does it have any impact on you when <br/>
your own children behave the same way? I for one am usually of the <br/>
opinion that if this is an example of your level of mental and <br/>
social development I probably won't care what you have to say if you <br/>
did stay. Given this example of your intellectual power it's highly <br/>
unlikely that you'll ever enlighten me or anyone else on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Your sweeping generalization that ALL of us jerks bounced someone is <br/>
perforce ridiculous. I don't know you, your friends, or even <br/>
what "bouncing" is or how to accomplish this. Your accusation is, <br/>
not surprisingly, as ill conceived as your rhetorical method.<br/>
<br/>
I usually don't respond to these or the equally infantile "you've <br/>
ruined this hobby for me" posts. I ignore them as the empty <br/>
meaningless fits they are but we've seen quite a few of these <br/>
recently. For the most part I don't know what the fuss is all about <br/>
but you accomplish nothing with these post other than revealing a <br/>
rather unflattering side of your personality.<br/>
