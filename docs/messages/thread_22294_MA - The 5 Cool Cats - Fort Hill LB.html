<br/>
Went to the new Fort Hill LB/geocache hybrid today.  Nice hiding spot <br/>
&amp; hand-carved stamp.  Seeing these clues jogged my memory about <br/>
another Fort Hill LB that had been placed a few or so years ago.  I <br/>
finally found the clues to the old box hidden in the basement <br/>
archives, so I decided to try for that box as well while I was there.<br/>
<br/>
What a fantastic box!  The walk is gorgeous &amp; the clues are just <br/>
phenomenal.  It seems a shame to have that box's clues just sitting <br/>
in the basement.  From what I read in the basement posts, many <br/>
attempts were made to contact the placers of the boxes that reside <br/>
down there to no avail.  I would love to adopt this box, but would <br/>
truly like to have the blessings of the original placers to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I am posting this message here &amp; on the big list hoping that The 5 <br/>
Cool Cats will contact me about their box.  Does anyone know if they <br/>
are still lbing?  Please if you're out there, let me know if I could <br/>
adopt this box.  I will wait a week or so &amp; if I do not hear, I will <br/>
assume they are no longer active boxers &amp; adopt this orphan.  Any <br/>
help or info from anyone that knows them would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
