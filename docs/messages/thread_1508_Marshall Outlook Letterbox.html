mine and his son went to Battleground Lake, Washington this weekend <br/>
and found the Marshall Outlook Letterbox planted by Der Mad Stamper <br/>
last Independence Day.  They didn't have a stamp or pen, and said the <br/>
pad hasn't been stamped yet.  I think I need to get up there and <br/>
check it out with my Paisley Orca!  They are going to go out and buy <br/>
a stamp and a pad soon and get back there to make their presence <br/>
known! I've been carving and hopefully will have something to hunt <br/>
for soon.  My boxes are almost complete.  If all goes well there will <br/>
be a series of four along the upper reach of the Columbia River <br/>
Slough by the end of the year, hopefully by the end of this month!<br/>
<br/>
