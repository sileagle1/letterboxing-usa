                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi guys!<br/>
<br/>
On a recent trip to the Atlanta area, I picked up a couple hitchhikers.  The<br/>
plan was to letterbox one more day and I would drop the HH then, but the<br/>
trip was cut short (sick kiddo) AND I did not locate 3 of the boxes I was<br/>
looking for on day 2, so I did not get to drop them off.<br/>
<br/>
I live near Nashville and there are only 3 boxes here and I have been the<br/>
only person to visit them so far.  I would like to give these HH a chance to<br/>
travel a bit more!  I am unsure of the ettiquite for time they should be<br/>
kept.  I can get them on their way again in a month or so, or should I mail<br/>
them off to someone that lives in a more box-riddled area?<br/>
<br/>
For the record, the boxes are June Bloom and 3 Maine Shells.  I dropped off<br/>
HH's Cranium, Basket Case, Ridge Rat and Sunset either in the Smokies or in<br/>
Georgia in the last month.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any advice as I am new to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don't think a month is too long to hang onto a HH, unless it is <br/>
the 'Honor Liberty' HH, which is trying to move through the country <br/>
within a specified period of time.  I have run across HH that show <br/>
lapses for a month or more, not to mention, it is not unheard of for <br/>
a HH to sit in a letterbox waiting to be found for that long.  Not <br/>
everyone letterboxes on a continual basis, or even every weekend.<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would maybe mail off the newer/less traveled HH to <br/>
give it a chance to move along, and hang onto the more traveled HH to <br/>
plant on your next letterboxing trip.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion...  There really is no right (or wrong) answer...<br/>
