Finally settling down to some "holiday spirits" back<br/>
in RI after several weeks in sunny Florida - with a<br/>
cruise to Mexico tossed in the middle! We found a<br/>
"Sunny Message in a Bottle" on our port call to Key<br/>
West, and thought it might make an interesting little<br/>
hitcher that could travel either by post or by<br/>
placement with another letterbox (totally up to the<br/>
whim of the finder), so we've sent that message on its<br/>
way and will be looking forward to seeing where it<br/>
goes. Please keep us posted, since there's no logbook.<br/>
Of course we also managed to take in some fascinating<br/>
letterboxing along the way - looking at loggerheads at<br/>
"Loggerhead", sharks' teeth at "Shark's Tooth", ants<br/>
at "Ant Castle Tree", etc. One of our favorite<br/>
adventures of the trip occurred near the Conch<br/>
Republic box at the Wild Bird Care Center on Key<br/>
Largo, where we hit the beach right at "feeding time"<br/>
(c.3:30) and were literally surrounded by about a<br/>
hundred flapping pelicans - quite an experience! We<br/>
were also dazzled by the light displays at Disney and<br/>
found Wilderness Lodge to be especially beautiful this<br/>
time of year, but couldn't get to the letterbox at<br/>
Caribbean Beach because that particular resort was<br/>
undergoing repairs. We also couldn't get to visit<br/>
"Sebastian" because it seems that the gate to his home<br/>
is now being guarded all day long, but perhaps someday<br/>
his owners will relocate him to a more accessible<br/>
spot. The only other difficulty we ran into was being<br/>
turned away halfway through our walk on the University<br/>
of Richmond campus in VA by a security person who told<br/>
us that, as a "private school", it was technically<br/>
closed for Thanksgiving break! Oh, well... all the<br/>
other box searches we were able to complete were just<br/>
fine. It was nice to be back briefly in Maryland and<br/>
Virginia for the first time since our early<br/>
letterboxing days a year and a half ago, and to get a<br/>
small sampling of the marvelous work being done by<br/>
some of the fun-loving and talented folks down that<br/>
way. (Hope to meet some of you someday!) We also<br/>
enjoyed giving rides to quite a few hitchers, and<br/>
finding our first boxes in other states like NC,<br/>
SC,and GA where we hadn't letterboxed before. One<br/>
of these days we'll probably post our state-by-state<br/>
countdown on the bottom of our webpage - just for our<br/>
own personal interest and the curiosity of those folks<br/>
who often ask us how many boxes we've found in<br/>
different states.  Meanwhile, many thanks to all the<br/>
wonderful, good-spirited letterbox planters out there<br/>
and Happy Holidays to all!<br/>
