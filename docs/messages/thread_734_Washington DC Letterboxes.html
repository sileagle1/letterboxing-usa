&gt; Greetings! I'm a New Englander who came down to DC for a conference and<br/>
&gt; poached on your territory by planting a few letterboxes (5 of 'em) in the<br/>
&gt; capital area. Could you make a link to them on the LBNA website? They are at:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://members.aol.com/drewclan/capital.htm<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, Jay has added 5 more boxes, this time in DC.  As for linking<br/>
them to the site, that would be Mitch's job (although I am somewhat looking<br/>
into getting server on a faster link for all of letterboxing.org someday,<br/>
maybe next year).<br/>
<br/>
Also,  I would recommend (to Jay and anyone else), to post clues and links to<br/>
clues to the main list, not to the state lists, as some of them I imagine are<br/>
not even monitored, and people should not have to depend on a webmaster before<br/>
getting access to clues.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I am close to solving the mystery of why some people cannot get<br/>
to Jay's clues.  It seems that if you use Netscape, you cannot access them,<br/>
(for some reason).  I've tried 3 different versions of Netscape (including the<br/>
latest version) on three different computers, no access, tried Microsoft's <br/>
browser on the same computers and got to the clues (although IE 4.0 has<br/>
trouble rendering Jay's home page).  Interestingly enough, I could not<br/>
access _another_ AOL Hometown page unrelated to letterboxing (and not in<br/>
the LbNA frames) using Netscape (AOL of course makes the Netscape browser,<br/>
which makes this even more baffling than usual).  I imagine, then, that<br/>
it is how Netscape is configured, because I'm sure if no one with Netscape<br/>
could get there, AOL would have heard about it.  So far, all I know is<br/>
that me and Bonnie are having the problem.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'd appreciate it if anyone _can_ access the above URL using any <br/>
version of Netscape if they would e-mail me the version and platform<br/>
info.  Otherwise, if Jay wants the clues accessible to Netscape users,<br/>
he may have to ask AOL what is going on, try getting rid of all the java<br/>
(which I imagine AOL adds), or move them to Geocities or something.<br/>
(We could also put a 'Microsoft browser necessary to access some of these<br/>
clues' if people don't have a 'tude about that, because with all those <br/>
clues, I imagine it would be a hassle to move them :-)).<br/>

Randy, I use both IE 5 and Netscape Navigator 4.6 and can access <br/>
Jay's pages with both. I am using Windows 95 (second version).<br/>
<br/>
Here are three different versions of Jay's home page address. Does it <br/>
make any difference which one you use?<br/>

The third version shows the format I have taken to using in our map <br/>
links to Jay's pages. It seems to bypass the Hometown top frame, <br/>
which was conflicting with our own LbNA top frame and creating <br/>
problems.<br/>

solve this problem.<br/>

page happen. I still think the problem is likely operator error: as<br/>
Nisa noticed, I use a cheapo web publishing tool (the same one Marty<br/>
uses on his web page, I think) and know absolutely nada about html.<br/>
With the tool, all the computer stuff is completely invisible: it's<br/>
just like word processing to me. As Tom knows, I just can't seem to<br/>
think in that more knowledgable mode and make even a simple "image map"<br/>
work...sorry for any trouble accessing our family's cluesheets. We'll<br/>
try and post them to the list here as they get done, which may save<br/>
headaches for some. I polled my rather extensive email address book of<br/>
friends and colleagues, and none had a problem getting on, whether<br/>
using IE, Netscape, Windows, or Mac. If you ever have trouble getting<br/>
on and would like a cluesheet direct, just email me at<br/>
drewclan@aol.com. We also do things the old fashioned way down here, on<br/>
real paper: all the local clues are available at the Waterford CT<br/>
Eastern Mountain Sports store, and I'd be glad to snail mail them to<br/>
you as well. And they look alot prettier than net downloads, too.<br/>
<br/>
And, concerning the FUN part, I really enjoyed getting down to DC and<br/>
planting some boxes there, although I couldn't bring my kids. On the<br/>
way down I detoured through Valley Forge and had a very nice fall day<br/>
(kind of like seconds on fall, since PA still is in color) hiking<br/>
around looking for Randy's series. Kind of like my mental html block,<br/>
I'm not very good at puzzleing, but I did manage to find #1, "A Walk in<br/>
the Park" just as the sun was going down. It's a terrific box and now<br/>
I'm looking for an excuse for another detour...thanks, Randy!<br/>

Nope.  I imagine its a how netscape is locally configured issue, since<br/>
3 people on this list have failed, all using netscape, but some people<br/>
succeed using netscape.  Since there is no way we can ask Internet users <br/>
at large to reconfigure their browsers to view these pages (since some <br/>
percentage of them will fail to view them) anyway, even if we figure out<br/>
what it is, the solutions seem to be (pick one):<br/>
<br/>
a) move them off AOL<br/>
b) use a different authoring tool<br/>
c) ask users to use Microsoft when viewing the site<br/>
d) have Jay post the clues via e-mail to the list<br/>
e) visit the EMS store or get them via snail mail <br/>
f) try eliminating spaces in filenames as suggested by the authoring tool<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone brought up this problem with AOL support or the support people<br/>
of the authoring tool?<br/>

I tried Explorer at work and was able to access all<br/>
three options with no problem.  I use Navigator at<br/>
home and it drew a blank on all three.  Is this data<br/>
any help?<br/>
