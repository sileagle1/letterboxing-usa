As to the log (yep, off topic again...but sorta on topic, too) that's <br/>
your choice.  If you want to preserve the existing stamps' images (in <br/>
whatever condition they're in Vs risking them to more damage) then <br/>
I'll gladly accept any log to stamp into that I find.  Now, that <br/>
being what it may, and wet logs being what they are, I carry blank, <br/>
unlined index cards to stamp in where I find wet logs; and I've found <br/>
a few, it's been a wet couple springs...your milage may vary. :p<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also think the PayPal thread is germaine to the situation that LbNA is in.  There have been those who felt that making a one-time or a monthly volunteer donation would help Choi get the site back up with sufficient bandwidth etc., and PayPal would be one way folks might donate.  I am brand new, too (signed on this morning, actually, and have yet to go letterboxing though I've known of it for years), but I'm guessing that's how the whole PayPal topic came up in the first place.  LbNA is offline; Choi needs more power in his server to handle it; let's make donations; how; PayPal; PayPal has some problems; other options.  <br/>
<br/>
Elementary, my dear Watson. :^ )   This is a recurring sequence when a data-heavy, programming-heavy website goes from being a personal playground to an international phenom.  Happened to NaNoWriMo; happened to Nervousness; happens to everyone.  Go, Choi, it'll work out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks MUCH to whomever pointed out that by clicking the View Cache button on the relatively new Quest site one could get to the clues even if the Get Clues button only linked to a downed page on LbNA.  I now have what I need to do some letterboxing during our two-week camping trip.  Well, in the sense that I have clues, and some lovely carving media (am testing three types as I have artist friends who strongly prefer MarsCarve and I want to see why).  <br/>
<br/>
Now...an image...something buggy...<br/>
<br/>
By way of intro--I'm a longtime casual mail artist, stamp carver, calligrapher, ATC artist, art experimenter.  Letterboxing appeals for artistic reasons, historic reasons, many reasons.  This year our strategy to keep the 17-YO engaged during a family vacation is to do some geocaching, to which we are also new; and since there are caches and boxes hidden in proximity in many places, I'm going to try to combine our searches to include both.  But never fear--I understand the difference. :^ )  Letterboxing is a historic, artistic, romantic pursuit that began in England in a lovelier century; geocaching is what happened when America got hold of the idea, dropped all the craftsmanship and added technology and McDonald's trinkets. <br/>
