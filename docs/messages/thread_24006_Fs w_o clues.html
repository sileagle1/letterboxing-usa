<br/>
We were up on the mountain the other day, got to the major landmark<br/>
for the box and started casting around. The WD pointed over at a pile<br/>
of rocks and said "I bet it's in there." But I followed the clues in<br/>
the opposite direction and after a bit of time found the box at the<br/>
base of a fallen tree.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, when we got back and looked at letterboxing.org we found<br/>
the clues for the other box on that part of the mountain - the one<br/>
under the pile of rocks.<br/>
