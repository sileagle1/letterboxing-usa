<br/><b>Sou</b>t<b>h Branch of the Raritan River</b>
<br/><p align="LEFT"></p>
<br/><b>July 6, 2002</b>
<br/>Flemington, New Jersey
<br/><b>Hunterdon County</b>
<br/><b>Planted by The Gnarly River Women</b>
<br/>
<br/>The Gnarlies are a group of women drawn together by our love of  paddling the rivers of New Jersey.  The group’s activities change with our members’ interests.  We’ve had a website and a newsletter, we’ve been down the Salmon on duckies and the Colorado on rafts (it was those Colorado River guides who named us).  We’ve paddled tandem canoes and solo canoes but lately many of us prefer kayaks. Our numbers on the river on any given day are as few as two and as many as twenty, but we all try to get out on a river at least once a season.  A few of us are into Letterboxing and hope to combine these two wonderful activities. BJ, our artist in residence, carved our logo stamp, and our intent is to plant letterboxes along our favorite rivers. This is our second.
<br/>
<br/>On Saturday morning 9 Gnarlies in 7 solo kayaks and 1 tandem canoe (there’s always one holdout) put in at Rockafellows Mills Road on the South Branch.  The weather was wonderful, and although the river was low, it was moving fairly quickly.  Two and a half hours later, after stopping for lunch and experiencing a gloriously leisurely paddle, we took out at Neshanic Station (we all made it over the dam.) Along the way we hid our second letterbox.
<br/>Easy clues, easy paddle, but check the water level<b>
<br/></b>
<br/>      Put in at Rockafellows Mills Road in Flemington.
<br/><p align="CENTER"></p><b>
<br/></b>Paddle under Route 202, under Old YorkRoad, and under Higginsville Bridge 
<br/>(it’s yellow)
<br/>Fairly soon after the HigginsvilleBridge you’ll see homes on the right and signs indicating a Nature Preserve on the left.
<br/><b>
<br/></b><p align="LEFT">      The riverbanks open up to fields, and at a left curve the river forks.  If you look    
<br/>      back on the right bank on a hill you should see a barn.
<br/>                                         
<br/>      Take the left, smaller fork.    
<br/>
<br/>      The letterbox is on a rope thrown over the elbow of the arm of the 3 trunked<b> </b>tree        
<br/>      on the left bank of the left fork.
