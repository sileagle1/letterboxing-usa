that stop you from finding these terrific letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
I was out hunting for Where the Wild Things Are in Lacey, WA and <br/>
Pandemonium broke out here at the letterboxing board. I am partly to <br/>
blame. I knew I never should have pressed that "Send" button. <br/>
<br/>
I am anti-geocache. But I certainly respect other folks their right <br/>
to plant and find geocaches. They are just not my cup of tea. I also <br/>
don't like pro-wrestling and I really hate shrimp. Yuck! So let us <br/>
hear from all those Shrimp Lovers out there!!! :-) Red Lobster awaits <br/>
YOU! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anywho,<br/>
I planted a letterbox today and it is called Pandemonium!<br/>
Here is where you can find the clues:<br/>

Please use caution when parking your car at this trailhead. There has <br/>
been a history of break-ins.<br/>
