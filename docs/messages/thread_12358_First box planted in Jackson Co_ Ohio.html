Sacred Symbol<br/>
<br/>
Nestled in the wooded hills of Jackson County, Ohio is a quiet little <br/>
park administered by the Ohio Historical Society.  It protects an <br/>
exposed slab of sandstone where ancient Native Americans carved what <br/>
are believed to be sacred symbols.  (Interesting that nobody ever <br/>
thinks these things are just prehistoric graffiti huh?)  It's a <br/>
lovely, quiet little place that most folks never are aware of or <br/>
think to go to so we decided it would be a good place to hide a <br/>
sacred symbol of our own.  If you follow the clues and look <br/>
carefully, you can add our sacred symbol to your collection.<br/>
	Go to the Leo Petroglyph State Memorial that is located about <br/>
4 miles off US Route #35 west of Jackson.  The turn off US Route #35 <br/>
is marked with brown and white directional signs and is about 4  5 <br/>
miles from the city of Jackson.  Just follow the signs to the quaint <br/>
little park that has a timber and stone shelter over the carvings.  <br/>
Unfortunately, vandals are taking a toll on the carvings but it's <br/>
still cool to look at them and think that they've been there 700 to <br/>
1000 years.  After you've looked at the old sacred symbols, go down <br/>
the stone steps on the south side of the structure to the Nature <br/>
Trails sign to begin your search for our sacred symbol.  Go south <br/>
down the trail into the ravine (Be careful  the trail is steep and <br/>
slippery the first few yards!)  Don't take the side trail to the <br/>
first waterfall  stay to the left on the main trail until you reach <br/>
the Hemlock Grove sign.  From the sign, walk about seven paces (2 <br/>
steps = 1 pace) on a bearing of 190.  You should be at a large <br/>
fallen tree lying across a large rock.  Look under the tree where it <br/>
crosses the rock on the uphill side under a couple of small rocks and <br/>
some leaves.  There you should find our sacred symbol.  Please bring <br/>
a stamp pad and a pencil with you!  After you've found it, send us an <br/>
email to bigguy_45640@yahoo.com and let us know if it needs any <br/>
attention.  So far as we know, this was the first letterbox planted <br/>
in Jackson County!<br/>
