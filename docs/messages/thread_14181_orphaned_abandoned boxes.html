<br/>
Please take the time to go to the site and search for boxes by placer.<br/>
In there is the choice of AbandonedBoxes. There are plenty! If you<br/>
want to adopt boxes in your area, you will be able to see which boxes<br/>
are abandoned by this list. In some cases, the clues to the abandoned<br/>
boxes have the original poster's e-mail address in them. You can<br/>
contact that person and see if they want to maintain their box, if<br/>
they want to box to disappear, of if they want to let you take over.<br/>
That's what I'm doing for Georgia (we have 3 in this state). <br/>
If you can't find the e-mail of the person in the clues, you can copy<br/>
and paste the clues to your computer so that you'll have them. At that<br/>
point, I would say it is safe to take over maintaining the box if<br/>
that's what you want to do. <br/>
Be sure and search for all of the abandoned boxes. I can see why Wes<br/>
and others want to clean up the database!<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents,<br/>
Mark<br/>

The boxes are under the name "AbandonedBoxes".<br/>
Much closer to the top of the list, alphabetically!<br/>

I'm asking in particular for CT: At one point, someone other than Jay <br/>
