                    <div class="plaintext-content">On September 7, 2002 Funhog placed the Beneath the Blue #4 Letterbox (HC) at Cape Meares State <br/>
Scenic Viewpoint near Tillamook, Tillamook County, Oregon. This park has wonderful hiking trails that <br/>
wend through old growth that is astonishing in size.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: from Downtown Tillamook at the intersection of Highway 101 and Route 6 go west 10 <br/>
miles on the Three Capes Scenic Loop. Park just before the gate into the park. This hike is about two <br/>
miles roundtrip and will take you to a secluded, rocky beach where you may be lucky enough to find some <br/>
tumbled agates. Make sure you go to see the "Big Tree" (major understatement) before you head downhill <br/>
toward the beach. <br/>
<br/>
To the Letterbox: Avoid all turns. Returning from the beach, stop at the first tree on the right adjacent <br/>
to the trail. You will find a rounded beach rock and a piece of driftwood hiding here, so out of place! What <br/>
else could they have in their company?<br/>
<br/>
note: HC indicates a hand carved stamp<br/>
