                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would like to propose having the first Letterboxing<br/>
Event to be held in Texas (that I know of) on Saturday,<br/>
March 6, at Bastrop State Park near Austin, TX.  That<br/>
time of year should be nice and before most kid sports<br/>
get started and before Spring Break for most people.<br/>
Bastrop is fairly centrally located in Texas so shouldn't<br/>
be too far for natives to drive, and out-of-towners could<br/>
fly into Austin or San Antonio and be only an hour or so<br/>
away, or Houston and be only 2.5 hours away.  There are at <br/>
least 7 boxes already in the park, another a few miles <br/>
outside the park, another at nearby Buescher SP and many <br/>
more in the Austin area.  Camping is available in the park <br/>
and nearby Austin is also a great place to visit and/or stay.  <br/>
I don't have any details yet but just wanted to see what <br/>
interest (if any) there would be in attending this event.  <br/>
Please respond with comments.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

real emergency comes up. My husband will have a heavy work schedule <br/>
then, but I have already talked to one son and his family, and they <br/>
will probably come too. Two of our other sons who letterbox would <br/>
like to come, if they have the time off from work. <br/>

I am really looking forward to this! <br/>
