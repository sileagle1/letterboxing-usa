                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've got great weather in the heartland.  I hunted up the Chisolm Trading <br/>
Post box this past Saturday.  Very nicely done, Duff. The bags in your <br/>
boxes have kept everything nice and tidy. I tried Martin's Martin, too, but <br/>
in the 45 minutes I had before the park closed, I couldn't find it.  I <br/>
would have loved another set of bearings to do a triangulation or resection <br/>
on, but I guess you can't have it all.  I also checked on a report of <br/>
non-finding for the Lake Overholser Spillway box, but it's still there, <br/>
though the hitchhiker that had been in it is not.<br/>
<br/>
One way that _some_ water gets into boxes, and certainly enough to cause <br/>
unbagged paper to get squiggy and metal rings or staples to rust is through <br/>
condensation of atmospheric moisture.  Most of us place boxes in nice <br/>
weather.  By late evening the materials in the box will have cooled enough <br/>
to condense a bit of the humidity sealed in the box at the time of closing <br/>
it.  After that, cooler weather (in winter for instance) exacerbates the <br/>
problem--turning all the atmospheric moisture into water droplets inside <br/>
the box. Bagging is sure a good solution to that.  Much less air and thus <br/>
moisture sealed into a bag than in the air volume of the box.  That little <br/>
bit of moisture has done a nice job of rusting staples on my <br/>
write-in-the-rain notebooks and making the glue holding the stamp to backer <br/>
a bit tacky.  Mostly though, my problems come from my cheap rubbermaid <br/>
boxes, placed unfortunately in place that can get drowned and, after <br/>
soaking for a while, let water in. That results in a box full of water with <br/>
stamp and notebook floating in blue or red water. Write-in-the-Rain <br/>
notebooks aren't the best for some stamp inks, but they do survive a <br/>
soaking and can be dried out with little ill effect.  Ultimately, though <br/>
ziplocking is a really good and less expensive strategy for dealing with <br/>
moisture and if sealed well will even protect against drowning.<br/>
