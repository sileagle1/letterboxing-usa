really enjoyed a hazy day among Mt Rainier's foothills.  Found all 3 <br/>
boxes in the series while blessed with a front row seat to nature's <br/>
show of a soaring Bald Eagle, flyfishers casting all around, cattle <br/>
&amp; nursing calves, bison, possibly a yak (I'm not sure if that's what <br/>
was at that farm--but that's my best guess), the tail end of the <br/>
salmon run up South Pairie Creek &amp; 3 nice little stamps by <br/>
SunSeeker.  Can't believe we were the first visitors to these boxes--<br/>
come on, guys, you had a 70 day headstart!  ;)  Left 'thunder'ous <br/>
applause for a wonderful letterboxing day at tHe feet of tHe <br/>
Cascades.  The only thing we missed today was a great view of Mt <br/>
Rainier (because the haze never lifted) but fortunately, we <br/>
witnessed that marvel up close &amp; personal last Friday from <br/>
Paradise.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails...<br/>
