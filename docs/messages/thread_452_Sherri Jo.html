&gt; OH boy feel like I have really stuck my foot in it now But the point <br/>
&gt; I was trying to make was I was agreeing with Dan'l about keeping it<br/>
&gt; as simple as possible.<br/>
<br/>
No to foot in mouth, at least I don't think that's what happened.  Yes<br/>
to simplicity, its a recurring theme.  If you ever want to make<br/>
suggestions as to how you would like to see something work to make<br/>
it simpler please share as I am always intrested in hearing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; help please to any and all that I may have offend please forgive my<br/>
&gt; inept way of speaking my piece<br/>
<br/>
You're not inept at all.  You're very thoughtful and you stated exactly<br/>
how you felt.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Dan'l<br/>
