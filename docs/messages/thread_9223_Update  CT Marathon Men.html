Yo--The Marathon Men in Niantic is NOT missing. He must have been out training
yesterday in the rain when I looked for him  Today he is back , snug and
resting comfortably , Go visit , it is a great Stamp in a pretty little park
with wonderful ocean views Come on down ! I am sorry, Green Heron for the
scare !! I really did not say it was missing, just that I failed.  Hay, you
guys have to remember I am old and sometimes can't find my boots. <br/>
