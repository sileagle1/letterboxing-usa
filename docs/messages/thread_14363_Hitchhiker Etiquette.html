HHs is probably pretty impossible unless you get really lucky. I <br/>
remember seeing some complaints about the "Love" series HHs. Some <br/>
folks got three of the four letters and never got the last, leaving <br/>
a conspicuous hole in their logbook. If the stamps can stand on <br/>
their own then this issue probably goes away mostly.<br/>

Go for it! There are few rules with this hobby. There's nothing wrong<br/>
with having a HH series. And I can just imagine the joy when a boxer<br/>
finds another one in the series after having found a previous one.<br/>
Great idea!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Pandora did a strange and unique thing with her Chaos series: she <br/>
placed HH in boxes belonging to other Googled members. The <br/>
instructions state that only the owner of the box could move the HH <br/>
and then only to another one of their boxes. How's thems fer rulez?<br/>
<br/>
Making it even more aggravating, each of the HHs was part of a larger <br/>
stamp, cut into four irregular pieces. So, if you did not stamp the <br/>
image on a separate piece of paper and then cut out the image, you <br/>
might (as I did) find that the four pieces will not line up. <br/>
<br/>
So go ahead, let them HHs out into the world. I understand that some <br/>
folks out east are overamped with them. Me, I count them and usually <br/>
am pleasantly surprised by them.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, somewhere in here I went over PFX 100. How about that?<br/>

Sir Balthazar: Cheers on the 100!<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of the series HH.  I love hitchhikers- while you're at it, could you send someone to my hitchhiker who understands that it should be taken?  <br/>
(*muttering about her stagnant HH, despite three visitors to the box since its planting)<br/>
<br/>
What about this additional twist?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could plant them in four different areas of the country?  The four compass directions?  See who on the list is the farthest northern location, fartherst eastern, western, southern, and send the boxes to them to release?  (That way you have a better chance of not clumping them up)<br/>
 "Like the points on a compass, so are the ideas of 4-H" *grin*<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

Remember an important rule of letterboxing is that there are no <br/>
rules! Do what you want. It's your box. I usually stamp my sig in my <br/>
HH's and I love to find HH's that have the maker's stamp in them, it <br/>
makes them more personal. But I love ANY HH I find, so it doesn't <br/>
really matter if they're stamped or not! LOL<br/>
