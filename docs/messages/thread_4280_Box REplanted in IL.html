"The Letterbox Formerly Known as Across the Board"<br/>
..U Island ..<br/>
<br/>
REplanted by MjLikePink &amp; Mohmers<br/>

<br/>
Locate Main Street in Collinsville, IL.<br/>
Stand in front of the historic Miners Theater.<br/>
Walk east for one block.<br/>
Stand at the Corner.<br/>
Look down.<br/>
What a Mistake!  Check your Compass.<br/>
Does something look askew to U?<br/>
Us too!<br/>
(I hate to admit I once worked for the company responsible for this blunder.)<br/>
If you don't get the mistake, that's OK.<br/>
Lucky for U, the arrow just happens to point U in the correct direction.<br/>
But no J-walking allowed.<br/>
Take the crosswalks like everyone else.<br/>
Look for this Bee-autiful Box high on a shelf.<br/>
Be sure to let them know why U came!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This box was the 2nd letterbox  planted in the Illinois St.Louis Metro East <br/>
area. Due to "unforeseen" circumstance it was removed from circulation in <br/>
11/2000 and has just been REplanted. . It is now known as: <br/>
U ISLAND: the letterbox formerly known as Across the Board. . <br/>
When you visit the area, the reasons will become obvious (at least for a <br/>
while). . <br/>
Sorry ... no access on Sundays or some evenings after 5:30pm.<br/>
<br/>
 Happy Hunting<br/>
<br/>
PS ... anyone who found this one at its original location can count this as a <br/>
new find .. if they find it again!<br/>
