letterbox.  It is missing.  A friend and I went looking for it and it<br/>
was gone.  Mitch, could you please make a note of it on the web site. <br/>
I am planning on doing a series on the East River and shall replace<br/>
this letterbox.  I will keep you all posted.  <br/>
Also, Steven can not tell his right from his left on the Algoma<br/>
Lighthouse Box.  The clue states "park bench on left" but one must go<br/>
to the "park bench on the right."  Please make another update, Mitch?<br/>
<br/>
That is all from Wisconsin.  Love you.  die xo<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hunted for that missing letterbox of Dierdra's, and<br/>
thought I must have looked in the wrong place too.  It<br/>
is a pretty popular place though, and the specific<br/>
location is frequented by scores of people for reasons<br/>
legitimate (fishing) and otherwise (fishing by kids<br/>
under 21 with beer taken from mom and dad's fridge.) <br/>
Dierdra has plans afoot for an entire series to take<br/>
its place though, starting with a new and improved<br/>
setting for the missing letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
What's our progress on 50 by Y2K?  Has anyone plans to<br/>
bring the deep South into the fold?  Is Hawaii in<br/>
anyone's near future travel plans?  I think I can add<br/>
Michigan if no one else is planning it, as the Upper<br/>
Penninsula is as close to me as Door Co. is.  Sure<br/>
it'd be sneaking a letterbox in through the back door<br/>
so to speak, but enough to get MI on the map.<br/>

So sad to hear of the lost box - are you absolutely sure you've hunted<br/>
in ann surrounding possibilities?  Was it located where a chance find<br/>
was unlikely?<br/>
<br/>
I may have a lost one as well - "Arnold's Gambit" was not found by at<br/>
least two searchers - several weeks apart. Its a sad feeling. I hope<br/>
that yours turns up. Keep the faith.<br/>

Yes it was located in a likely place where fishermen may have found it<br/>
and not known what it was.  I was told by my friend Steve, that boys<br/>
will go fishing there.  He is going to help me with the Green Isle Park<br/>
Series I am going to be creating once I am done housesitting at my<br/>
father's. <br/>
 I hope that yours turns up. Keep the faith.<br/>
Thanks.  I am going to keep on searching<br/>
Thanks again.  <br/>

    I'm sorry to say that I haven't been able to get out to the "Hole in<br/>
the Wall" and check for the box. As the box's "parent" its my<br/>
responsibility to confirm that it was indeed missing. If you have<br/>
already stamped in at the Hole in the Wall Box a few months ago, and now<br/>
that you have returned to find it gone, I can confidently assume that it<br/>
is truly missing. (Some people have called a box MIA if they are simply<br/>
unable decipher the clues correctly) It is my intention to replace the<br/>
box and hopefully hide it in a different spot. I too do not understand<br/>
why some folks find it irresistable to take the boxes. There was a note<br/>
in it explaining about letterboxing and asking accidental finders to<br/>
replace the box. I know that this is a problem in Dartmoor as well.<br/>
    I am eagerly looking forward to hunting your boxes, Joie, when you<br/>
hide them this Spring.<br/>

PS In the meantime, Webmasters, could you please make a note  that "Hole<br/>
in the Wall" is missing?   Thanks<br/>

<div>just came in from x-country skiing along the lehigh canal tow path in bethlehem,pa. very nice day for it.checked in on "hole in the wall" box which is one in a series of three on the tow path and found that it is still missing..found it for the first time on 11-19-00 . it was my thirdbox, i am a "newbie", and my son and i had been the first ones to stamp in which was a real thrill for us.i went back on 12-6-00 to see if and who stamped in after us and found it missing ....i was heartbroken about it and certain that we had gone to length to re-hide it was at a loss as to why someone would take off with it even if they somehow had "stumbled" onto it. anyway, that was before i had a computer and before i joined LBNA. i asked my friend who introduced me to letterboxing to notify the boxes parent which she did. my thought is that on the clue site there is no mention that this box is gone for now...i know that some clues do inform you if a box is M.I.A. .as does jacobsburg eec box#2. i appreciate the info when i pick places to go and thought that mention could be made about " hole in the wall ".  i have had great fun stamping into the five boxes i have found so far, thanks to all the creators out there!!! keep your eyes open for the clues for the boxes i have planned to put out this spring!  see joy</div></div></div><br clear="all"/><hr/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/></body></html>

I have the clues printed out, searched today &amp; we found a destroyed box, weren't sure if it was the box or not.  But I now can't find any box by that name or place or either site.
