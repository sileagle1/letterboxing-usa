                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tom and I checked out the two new Stafford Speedway (Today and Yesterday) boxes this past weekend.  GREAT stamps!  The directions for Yesterday's box are a wee bit off.  Instead of .03 miles from the T, they should read .3 miles.  It gave us an extra walk in the woods - but added to the challenge!<br/>
<br/>
We also found our first CT DEP box in Nipmuck Forest in Union.  Boy, what a great thing for the DEP to be doing!  Does anyone know the story behind it - is there a letterboxer working for the DEP who's doing this on their own time, or is it really state funded?<br/>
<br/>
In our travels on Sunday, we picked up a hitchhiker - Honda Road Again, and left one off - FFA at 75.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on boxing!<br/>

Forestry in honor of the Centennial of the State Forest system!  If you collect at <br/>
least 5 of the stamps, you can earn a patch.  I believe there are 30 all <br/>
together.  It is a nice celebration, isn't it?   <br/>
