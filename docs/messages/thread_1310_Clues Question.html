<div>Not to worry.... no such thing 
as a stupid question...   and pretty much yes to all of your question. 
It's up to you. make them as easy or hard as you like.  Start out 
basic/easy and work up from there.    No, you do not have to have 
a web page. As the webmaster for the south east and mid atlantic states, we can 
link to the eGroup message posting your clues, or as I just did for Virginia 
Beach, just took their text and put it on a generic LbNA page on our site...... 
Up to you</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Go for it and have 
fun....  been said before     "if you hid it, they will 
come"</div>

You can post it on the web, also give a paper copy to EMS in the Crystal<br/>
Mall. I did a great letterbox appropriate for pre-schoolers but fun for<br/>
Senior Citizens. The only problem was that one of the boxes was to in<br/>
the open and some kids ruined it. Making the 2nd hard to find. It's very<br/>
possible but you need to be sure that it will stay put. You could leave<br/>
a note on the box asking that the box and all of it's contents be placed<br/>
back and carefully hidden. I wouldn't want your hard work to go to<br/>
waste. <br/>
