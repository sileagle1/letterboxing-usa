BOX: Valley Forge #1<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION: Valley Forge Nat'l Historical Park, Chester<br/>
County, PA.<br/>
<br/>
DIFFICULTY: **<br/>
<br/>
DATE/NUMBER: 29-Aug-98/1<br/>
<br/>
MAP:  Look for a pointer about 3333 feet north of the <br/>
memorial arch.  It doesn't point to the Box, unfortunately,<br/>
but man, you should at least find water.  With soldiers <br/>
behind you, look for the right pines, which are taller yet<br/>
much more difficult to see than the wrong pines.  From the<br/>
center of this grove, go to the small presidents' abode, <br/>
by following a bearing of 260 degrees from magnetic north.  <br/>
&gt;From the basement door, follow continue on 260 degree bearing<br/>
to the tip of the woods.  Thence, 22 degrees for 22 paces will<br/>
lead you to the box under a pile of deadwood. <br/>
<br/>
DISCLAIMER: HUNT THIS LETTERBOX AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Hunting this <br/>
and any letterbox involves general risks and risks specific to <br/>
letterboxing; hiking outdoors involves various risks, and there<br/>
are unsafe areas of Valley Forge Nat'l Historical Park.  These<br/>
risks are compounded by the possibility of getting lost, <br/>
misinterpreting clues, or making bad route choices.  Consider <br/>
consulting a park ranger or a map at the visitor's center before <br/>
hunting.  Do not hunt this letterbox without reading and agreeing<br/>
to the Letterboxing USA waiver first. Children, do not hunt this <br/>
or any letterbox without the supervision of an adult.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE 1: Off-trail walking is involved, although it is possible to<br/>
do most of it on mowed trails and paved roads.  Proficiency with a<br/>
compass is needed.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE 2: There is an wooded area north of the arch where a maintenance<br/>
area is.  Do not attempt to go through the woods in this area.  There<br/>
is a paved road/parking lot that runs right east of the maintenance <br/>
building, indicated by a "Maint. Area" sign.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE 3: Valley Forge park is a great place to spend the day walking,<br/>
biking, or picnicking.  Also, there are many deer in the park, best<br/>
viewing is sunrise, sunset, and on dreary days.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE 4: Please re-hide the thing well were you found it.  This area of<br/>
the park gets alot of visitors.<br/>

<br/>
The stamp was gone and the box was left in the open.  <br/>
Fortunately it was a rather simple stamp and I had<br/>
the original pencil drawing still, so I was<br/>
able to make another one (if you call what I do making<br/>
stamps :-)).    <br/>

Well, the park is pretty heavily visited, so I imagine that it<br/>
was random.  Lesson learned: hide it better :)  I'll definitely<br/>
be making the hiding places more remote, and the clues harder<br/>
(because I personally have a preference for challenging clues anyway).  <br/>
The problem is that the parks in this area are small and heavily<br/>
visited, but this can be worked around with a little creativity<br/>
and a little travel.  Also, Valley Forge is such a beautiful place,<br/>
even though a bit crowded, so I had to try one there.  It was also<br/>
an appealing place because its a 10 minute drive from where I work,<br/>
so I could check on it at lunch, it being the first one and all...<br/>
<br/>
later,<br/>

Randy... sorry to hear about your l-box.  I was worried about Rock Creek<br/>
#1 for the longest time because of the heavy use the area sees.  Since I<br/>
moved it (the old location is at present under 4' of water), I am more<br/>
confident that it will stay where it is even though it is RIGHT next to<br/>
the main trail.  (NOTE:  IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO HUNT FOR ROCK CREEK #1<br/>
STOP READING HERE!!!)<br/>
<br/>
The spot I chose is in a hollow tree.  The hollow was so deep that I<br/>
didn't think I could drop the box into it and be able to retrieve it<br/>
later.  I solved this by drilling a small hole in the rim of the<br/>
tupperware container (not the lid nor through the body of the<br/>
container).  I tied a 2' length of 20# fishing monofilament with a good<br/>
blood knot.  At the other end of the line I attached (using a similar<br/>
knot) a wood plug I whittled from a twig.  It doesn't have to be<br/>
anything fancy, but it should blend in with the background &amp; have some<br/>
kind of groove so the fishing line won't slip off.  On location, I drop<br/>
the letterbox into the hole and hook the plug over a small branch<br/>
growing nearby.  You might want to scout your intended spot before<br/>
snipping your fishing line to any length.  Anyway, my box is suspended<br/>
in the hole of this tree below eye level.  The line is noticeable only<br/>
by close scrutiny &amp; there is enough understory growing up around it that<br/>
actually getting to the letterbox is more of a challenge than the clues.<br/>
<br/>
This is how I solved my problem.... good luck with yours!!!<br/>
