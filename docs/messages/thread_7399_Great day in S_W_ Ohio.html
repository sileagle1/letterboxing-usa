<div>Today (9/2) I spent the day (8 hours) with one 
of my dogs, Team Min Dawg &amp; Franzsolo in &amp; near East Fork Lake looking 
for letterboxes &amp; geocaches. I hadn't been to the area before and ended up 
with 14 new finds! We were able to do all of these &amp; still take the time to 
make sure they were hidden as well (or better) than we found them &amp; haul out 
a bit of trash from the trails. Most were in good condition, but Franz took the 
'wild thing' box with him to do some repairs. </div>
<div>We found the 6 stamps in the East Fork lake series, 
the East Fork Lake stamp, Gold box &amp; the bonus stamp, Owl's nest, foot 
prints, Force boxes 1 &amp; 3, Bass island &amp; a geocache -'raiders of 
the lost cache'. We were the first one's to stamp the 'woldwalker' box even 
though it was placed back in May! It was not an easy find. This box was easily 
visible from the trail because it was not under the rock, but I don't think it's 
a popular trail. It looked like a critter had been chewing on the container. We 
made sure to hide it well. </div>
<div>We found that the Forcebox 2 stamp was in the Force 
box #3 container. We were also unable to locate Force box #2, Be Happy &amp; one 
of the geocaches. It was a great day &amp; my dog really enjoyed the hikes &amp; 
swimming in the lake to cool off. I enjoyed the searches &amp; the great 
company.</div>
