                    <html><body>Hello all!  Just thought I would give an update on this weekend's boxing.  It started off 0-3 in the Avon/West Hartford area.  I couldn't park for the Avon Letterbox, since there was a foot of snow in the parking area.  Then I went to find the Farmington Valley Greenway box (I tried to do it the short way by trying to find the town hall, however, I don't know if I'm really dense or if its not very clearly marked, but I couldn't find it).  Anyway, I decided to go to the West Hartford Resevoir for the MDC Resevoir box, found the rocks, but couldn't chisel through the glacial ice to see if the box was even there.  At that point, I decided to call it a day, since I didn't start boxing until 2pm due to rehearsals all morning.
<br/>
<br/>Today was MUCH more fruitful!  I drove down to Lebanon and was happy to visit the Gray at Liberty Hill, Lebanon Loop Series, Blue Goose at the Town Pound, and In Memory of Brandi letterboxes.  I was unable to fish out the Night on the Lebanon Green box, since it was under about six inches of cold water and slush.  I'm hoping that the box makes it out dry but I'm not hopeful....  I then went to have pizza in Marlborough and met a fellow letterboxer, Jessie (who helped plant the Lebanon Loop series), but was unable to exchange with her, since she was working :-)  I'll be sure to stop for pizza again!
<br/>
<br/>I also tried to find Red Men at Holbrook Pond, with no luck due to the large amount of glacial ice and snow on the stone wall.  I'll be sure to come back in spring!  Lastly, my best find of the day, was being first to stamp into the DEP's Meshomasic State Forest Letterbox (#1) in Portland.  As you all probably know, I've planted numerous boxes in this particular forest and really enjoyed going up to the overlook!  However, a word of caution.... it is EXTREMELY slippery!!!!  Please be careful!
<br/>
<br/>All in all, eight boxes this weekend... not bad considering that the snow is still high in many parts of the state!
<br/>
<br/>Happy Trails everyone!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Patrick &amp; I did a little boxing Sunday despite the weather.  The Book <br/>
Barn boxes were just to hard to pass up!!  The boxes were great and <br/>
it's always been one of our favorite places.  This morning I made a <br/>
quick jaunt to Harley's Hex(Patrick was working) and found it alos in <br/>
good order.  Also picked up Heidi's 25th Birthday HH.  Too funny, <br/>
since Steve and Heidi are freinds of ours.  We'll hopefully have some <br/>
new boxes ready to go out when we get back from Philly, now that the <br/>
weather is finally cooperating(sort of).<br/>
