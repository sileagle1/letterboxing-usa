I think I'll go shopping today and see what I can find.  I, too, don't<br/>
need all the extra things in the starter's package.  I was looking for<br/>
more #1 and those aren't on the shelves either.  I'll visit a couple of<br/>
specialy art stores, not Hobby Lobby, Michaels or Joann's.  I thought I<br/>
would order some PZKut for the first time once I used up every piece of my<br/>
current stash.  I like the pink pearl erasers, but my ideas are bigger<br/>
than that size.  I haven't found that eraser for BIG mistakes yet, but<br/>
that may be an option.  I had one of those 30 years ago but never imagined<br/>
a better use for it.<br/>
