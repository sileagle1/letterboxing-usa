Letterbox #2:		Hells Hollow<br/>
Placed:  		May 27, 2002<br/>
Difficulty:  		EASY once you are on the path to Hells Hollow Falls.<br/>
Time estimate:  	Once arriving at the path - 40 min To Hells Hollow:	There are two main ways to get to  <br/>
                        Hells Hollow.  <br/>
	1.  One is hiking the Slippery Rock Gorge Trail which extends from  Eckert Bridge to Hells Hollow.  This 6 mile non-loop trail is designated as part of the North Country Scenic Trail.  This is a long, and in places, difficult trail.  See the directions starting from Letterbox #3.<br/>
<br/>
	2.  The other is from a small parking area near the Hells Hollow Falls.  This parking area is on Shaffer Road, near the intersection of Center Church, Heinz Camp Road and Shaffer.<br/>
<br/>
To the Letterbox:<br/>
Follow the trail to Hells Hollow Falls.<br/>
At the falls, you will see a brick lined Lime Kiln.  <br/>
At the top, the lime kiln is surrounded by a fence with five posts.<br/>
Stand at the uppermost (highest point on hill) post.<br/>
Face the stream.  <br/>
Directly at your back is a ledge of shale.<br/>
At the top of the shale are two good size evergreen trees (cedar?)<br/>
Get up to those trees somehow.  (you can follow the path to the right and find another small path on the left which will take you up there, but keep those trees in sight)<br/>
<br/>
When you are at the top of the shale ledge near the big trees, look for an old overturned evergree with multiple branches protruding like spikes.  This tree acts as a bridge over a large sink hole.<br/>
<br/>
The box is hidden near the roots under the trunk of the overturned tree.<br/>
Still pretty easy, eh?<br/>
<br/>
There are more McConnells Mill's boxes to find!<br/>
