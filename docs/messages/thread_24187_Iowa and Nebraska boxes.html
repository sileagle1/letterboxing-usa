                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings all, I have just returned from a trip to the heartland and<br/>
managed to do a bunch of checking, replacing and hiding of<br/>
letterboxes. All but one of my letterboxes in IA and NE (that's<br/>
Nebraska to you New England folks who've adopted their moniker) are<br/>
alive and well. Mandan Heron is missing in action. Several others now<br/>
have new clues; Papillion has a different stamp as well as a new clue<br/>
and I left a brand new box, Antique Apples, in my wake. <br/>
<br/>
I also managed to track down several letterboxes from the very<br/>
prolific Lincoln letterbox planter, Ona Journey. Thanks so much for<br/>
hiding so many. Your part of the country needs more like you. Funhog<br/>
