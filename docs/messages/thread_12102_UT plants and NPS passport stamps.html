                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found "the Rings" today.  I'm getting good at being the first stamp in Aryn's letterboxes.  I hope it will last.  I'm also planning on planting one this weekend.  I will try to keep it in the proximity of I-80 so that if the family that was moving comes through, they will be able to stop.  Whoever that was, I hope you're watching your email (:<br/>

I plan on hitting Promontory Point in UT on my way back to ID.  Does anyone know if that box is still active?  If nothing else it will be a stamp for my National Park Service Passport.  I have been wondering if many others collect the NPS passport stamps.  I was into that before I discovered letterboxing.  I plan on keeping both up.  It's not uniquely personal like our stamps are, and the element of the hunt is not there, but I've seen places I would have never gone if it weren't for the stamp hunting and the memories are personal.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Jana<br/>
After I planted The Rings, I went to find the letterbox at Golden <br/>
Spike.  I totally was clueless at the time because I spent the first <br/>
hour on the wrong trail and gave up.  As I drove away I realized <br/>
there was another trail parallel and I realized I had solved the <br/>
clues wrong...I'm so bright.  =-)  So I returned and found the Golden <br/>
Spike letterbox right away then.  Cute stamp!!!  <br/>
<br/>
I'll have to look for the clues on the other box you asked about.<br/>
Enjoy!!  Have a safe trip.<br/>

a year now.  We find that, just as you say, we see a lot of great <br/>

Sometimes it can be  a bit of a hunt to get the stamps you want. There are some that <br/>
are really hard to get because of the location or ones that are only available at certain <br/>
times of year. There's a nice group on MSN that started recently and a good <br/>
discussion board at eParks.com. They're good for learning about new parks and <br/>
obscure stamps.<br/>
