                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have two opportunities here.<br/>
<br/>
At a "Volunteer Retreat", a weeknd camping event for adult leaders, I'll<br/>
have the opportunity to teach both "eraser carving" and "fun foam<br/>
construction" to make stamps (as a neat craft), and have the group wander<br/>
around our mountain camp (following posted clues) to find a bunch of<br/>
letterboxes I plan to carve.<br/>
<br/>
In a proposed "Advanced Troop Camper" class, I'll have a similar opportunity<br/>
(probably without caving) to introduce letterboxing in the Long Beach area<br/>
to a group of leaders. (It'll be "sold" to them as something fun they can do<br/>
on a hike with their troops.) For this, I'd like to create a dummy box and<br/>
plant it the night before the event, then let them find it in groups. I<br/>
think I want to do it this way because there are several "real" letterboxes<br/>
in the area we'd be using, and I don't want to have bunches of people<br/>
"finding" a real box in public.<br/>
<br/>
With luck, we'll create a bunch of new letterboxers in Long Beach!<br/>
