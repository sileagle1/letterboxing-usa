We are available any other weekend in June though and we are kind of glad that it's being moved.  One question though...is this now bumping up against a Ryan gathering in Harper's Ferry?  Should we combine the two?<br/>

ours:<br/>
<br/>
June 7th is out: a birhtday day party, gymnastics practice, two piano<br/>
recitals and three end of the school year evaluations is enough for one day<br/>
June 14th we will be out of town<br/>
<br/>
June 21st or 28th works for us<br/>

I've been to Burke Lake Park and seen many nice picnic areas but not a <br/>
pavilion - where is it?<br/>
