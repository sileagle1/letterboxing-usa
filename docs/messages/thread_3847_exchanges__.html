your personal stamp into their log book and they stamp into your book.<br/>
This happens a lot at the gatherings.  I have not been to a gathering<br/>
yet, but I have exchanged with a couple of other "boxers" that I have<br/>
met over the last year.  It is great to have  a letterboxing buddy in<br/>
the same state to go out hunting with.  Yes that means you SeeJoy :^)<br/>
even if I do drag her all over the top of the Mt. lol<br/>
Hope this answers your question.<br/>

I've seen a few of you mention exchanges and I know that's the E in the<br/>
signature lines, but I'm not sure I understand what you exchange.  Do<br/>
you<br/>
carve stamps ahead of time and keep them with you in case you run into<br/>
another letterboxer?<br/>
