                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well....I spoke with Da Man over the phone last night and he may have<br/>
relatives coming the weekend of the letterboxing event, so it is<br/>
doubtful we will be there.  (A couple of these relatives are more into<br/>
smoking and television than letterboxing so having them tag along isn't<br/>
really an option). However, if I can get away myself, I will attempt it.<br/>
It sure would be great to hook up with everyone up there!  I'll have to<br/>
play it by ear, though.<br/>

We hear that dvn2r ckr will be very ill that day, the dreaded letterbox<br/>
fever, and will have to miss work.  She will need some serious assistance<br/>
finding a cure (or some other things).  Helping a friend who is gravely ill<br/>
should be an adequate excuse to come lend a healing hand!<br/>

On the off chance they won't believe that one, we can dream up many more<br/>

Letterboxing Fever.  She wouldn't dare want to pass that on to her <br/>
visiting relatives, now would she???  She should come play with the <br/>
other folks who suffer from the same illness that day, shall we call <br/>
it a 'letterboxer quarantine'?  ;)<br/>

over a month.  Just long enough for me to feel the need to be<br/>
quarantined about the time folks are intending to gather in Steilacoom<br/>
