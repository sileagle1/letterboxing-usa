I would not group PZ cut in with the speedball "pink stuff" as I do <br/>
believe it is bit better quality and a lot easier to carve in great <br/>
detail on. I think it closer to Steadler Mastercarve quality without <br/>
the Mastercarve prices, and it is not as thick as Mastercarve either.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if you can get PZ cut anywhere else but April, perhaps <br/>
someone else has that information.  However you might be able to get <br/>
some from her before she goes out of business. Her website address <br/>
is located below. <br/>
<br/>

I hope that answers some of your questions. If not just give me a <br/>

I assume April still has the PZ cut - it is still listed on her website.<br/>

(http://www.negia.net/~unity/).  I believe she has been the sole <br/>
distributor of PZKut and is closing up shop.<br/>
<br/>
PZKut is a white carving material, 1/4" thick.  It is tougher than <br/>
most other carving materials, which is why it is superior for detail <br/>
carving.  To compare, it is most like the pink stuff, but not quite <br/>
as pliable.  In comparison Staedler MasterCarve is much more pliable <br/>
than either of these and "cuts like butter."<br/>
<br/>
April sells both an A grade and a B grade of PZKut, both come in <br/>
sheets 10" x 4 3/4".  When I spoke with her last week she was <br/>
expecting a shipment of A grade but most of that was spoken for -- <br/>
she has since got this in as I received my order on Saturday.  She <br/>
indicated that she has lots of B grade left.  The A grade sells for <br/>
$5/sheet and the B grade for $3/sheet.  I have used the B grade on <br/>
several occasions and for the most part have been happy with it.<br/>

I am personally a very big fan of Mastercarve.  You can get it in <br/>
several sizes and it is a bit more expensive, but I think that for <br/>
the detail it allows you it is well worth the price.  Most the time <br/>
people only find Mastercarve in the really thick form, but they have <br/>
a thin form too which is just a tad bit thicker than PZ Cut  but <br/>
quite a bit more expensive.  I get a 4x4 sheet for about $2.50 when <br/>
I buy it in bulk. (A tip I got from Funhog  Thanks Funhog!!)  There <br/>
is also a website where you can join their VIP list for $25 for a <br/>
year and get a 30% discount off the regular price, making it just <br/>
$1.82 a block for the 4x4  thick.  I have also used the Dick Blick <br/>
EZ Cut that you asked about and found that it was not as easy to <br/>
carve for fine detail but worked good for things that didn't require <br/>
fine lines and tiny carve out areas. <br/>
<br/>
The website I mentioned earlier for the Mastercarve is located at<br/>
<br/>
http://www.misterart.com/store/view.cfm?<br/>
group_id=5908602&amp;store=001&amp;AID=10273655&amp;PID=1117139&amp;afsrc=1<br/>
<br/>
They also have the Mastercarve carving tools, which I have found to <br/>
be much easier to handle than the speedball handle ones for detailed <br/>
design.<br/>

I hope this answers your questions, if not just holler again!<br/>

<br/>
I just checked the list price for the size you spoke of and it <br/>
retails for about $4.50 a block so I would say $9 for too is about <br/>
$1.00 to high, however if you are buying it locally in a store that <br/>
is probably an average price.  Just so you know the speedball white <br/>
stuff is bad, really bad! It cracks terrible and will no withstand <br/>
any serious climate changes like through a harsh winter without the <br/>
stamp cracking in half. Or such has been my experience as well as <br/>
many others.<br/>
<br/>
I would again refer you to the following website for Mastercarve<br/>
<br/>
http://www.misterart.com/store/view/001/group_id/7882/STAEDTLER-<br/>
Mastercarve-Artist-Carving-Block.htm<br/>
<br/>
You can get the size you talked about for $4.01 regular price or <br/>
$3.15 with their VIP discount. (But you have to pay $25 for a year <br/>
of VIP membership) If you plan on doing a lot of carving it probably <br/>
pays off in the end.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure what area of the country you are in, but if you can <br/>
you might want to join us for the Stamp Camp event in August or join <br/>
one of the Local Regional groups to get in contact with other letter <br/>
boxers in your area that can help you with more of your questions =)<br/>

I just asked because I did a quick search on EBay, and the 2 blocks I <br/>
mentioned were selling for $9, but add on $3 for S&amp;H and I guess it <br/>
does come out to a lot!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the art stores in the area, even the "real" art stores, <br/>
are lax in carrying good carving mediums, so I've only picked up the <br/>
Speedball white stuff. I've been looking into buying some better <br/>
materials, but didn't realize how rare some of the stuff is (like <br/>
PZKut!)!<br/>
<br/>
I'll check out that link! Oh, and I'm in PA..and I think you're on <br/>
the West Coast (?), so I'm probably a bit too far for your event - <br/>
but thanks for mentioning it! :)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Greetings Fleur de Lis,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just checked the list price for the size you spoke of and it <br/>
&gt; retails for about $4.50 a block so I would say $9 for too is about <br/>
&gt; $1.00 to high, however if you are buying it locally in a store that <br/>
&gt; is probably an average price.  Just so you know the speedball white <br/>
&gt; stuff is bad, really bad! It cracks terrible and will no withstand <br/>
&gt; any serious climate changes like through a harsh winter without the <br/>
&gt; stamp cracking in half. Or such has been my experience as well as <br/>
&gt; many others.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would again refer you to the following website for Mastercarve<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.misterart.com/store/view/001/group_id/7882/STAEDTLER-<br/>
&gt; Mastercarve-Artist-Carving-Block.htm<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can get the size you talked about for $4.01 regular price or <br/>
&gt; $3.15 with their VIP discount. (But you have to pay $25 for a year <br/>
&gt; of VIP membership) If you plan on doing a lot of carving it <br/>
probably <br/>
&gt; pays off in the end.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not sure what area of the country you are in, but if you can <br/>
&gt; you might want to join us for the Stamp Camp event in August or <br/>
join <br/>
&gt; one of the Local Regional groups to get in contact with other <br/>
letter <br/>
&gt; boxers in your area that can help you with more of your questions =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know very little about carving, as I'm a very new (and not very <br/>
&gt; &gt; good) carver and have thus far been resigned to using the <br/>
&gt; Speedball <br/>
&gt; &gt; white stuff...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; That being said, would 2 blocks of Mastercarve (2.5x5.75) for $9 <br/>
&gt; be a <br/>
&gt; &gt; good deal or am I getting ripped off?<br/>

fit 4 sheets in a Priority Mail envelope for $3.85 shipping. So for<br/>
$23.85 you get 40" x 4.75" of carving surface.....Not bad!  :-)  I<br/>
love this stuff.<br/>

Thanks Pandora for the link for the thin mastercarve, now I know where<br/>
to go when my stock of PZKut runs out.  :-)<br/>
