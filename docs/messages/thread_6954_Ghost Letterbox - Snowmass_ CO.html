Location: Snowmass, CO - Pitkin County<br/>
Date of Placement: August 14th, 2002<br/>
Difficulty:  Strenuous<br/>
Total miles to Hike: 4.5 miles to letterbox<br/>
Placed by: Uncle Mikey<br/>
<br/>
Directions: <br/>
   This letterbox is located at the end of a trail called the Anaerobic <br/>
Nightmare just outside of Snowmass, Colorado. Two other trails, the Owl Creek <br/>
and Tom Blake, are necessary to hike before reaching this trail. There are no <br/>
good parking spaces near the trails in Snowmass, but there is a small lot <br/>
near a playground that seems to work just fine.<br/>
    From I-70, take state road 83 to Aspen (coming from Glenwood Springs) As <br/>
you arrive near Aspen, ignore the turn to Snowmass Village and keep driving <br/>
towards Aspen. After you pass the Airport, you will encounter a stoplight <br/>
next to the Buttermilk Ski Resort. Turn right as if going to Buttermilk, but <br/>
do not turn into the resort. The road you are on is Owl Creek Road, but it is <br/>
not marked as such. As you travel this road, it will turn to dirt, and then <br/>
back to pavement as you near Snowmass Village. Once reaching Snowmass, Owl <br/>
Creek Road makes a turn to the left, but the road continues forward with a <br/>
name change. Follow Owl Creek, and after a short while, you will see a wooden <br/>
sign dropping the speed limit to 20 mph, as well as a sign below it reading <br/>
"We (heart) our children". The very next left is a small parking lot by the <br/>
Cathy Robinson Playground. Park here.<br/>
   If you face the opposite direction you were driving on Owl Creek Road, you <br/>
will have a paved trail running left/right, and a playground on the right. <br/>
Follow the paved trail to the left, but do not cross the road to follow the <br/>
Fox Run Trail. Instead, go straight ahead to follow the Owl Creek Trail.<br/>
   The Owl Creek Trail runs alongside Owl Creek Road, but eventually diverts <br/>
a slight ways away to make it seem less like a sidewalk. It will be about two <br/>
miles to the head of the Tom Blake Trail, the second trail of the hike. As <br/>
you walk along Owl Creek, you will cross Two Creeks Drive, and entrance to <br/>
Stark's Trail on the left, and the entrance to the Two Creeks Ski Area. You <br/>
will then encounter a sign directing you forward to Tom Blake trail.<br/>
   The Owl Creek trail will continue across Pine Crest Drive, and then <br/>
switchback up a hill. After reaching the top, the trail will descend downward <br/>
into the forest, and the head of the Tom Blake is not far away. There are two <br/>
sections to the Tom Blake trail - one for hikers and bikers, and one for <br/>
Equestrians and Skiers. The first entrance will be for the Equestrians, so <br/>
skip it and walk a few hundred feet more to the Hiker entrance to the Tom <br/>
Blake trail.<br/>
  Note: The Tom Blake trail is closed from April 25th to June 20th to allow <br/>
the wildlife to have peaceful calving time away from humans. It is also <br/>
partially closed in the wintertime, for reasons that were not clear. <br/>
  As you follow the Tom Blake trail, it will ascend at a moderate height <br/>
through the forest, and there will be several trail signs directing you (To <br/>
Snowmass Village Mall), depending if you are a hiker or are on horseback. <br/>
Always follow the way of the hiker, and there should be three signs (not <br/>
always facing you) before you reach the part of the trail which closes in the <br/>
wintertime. There will be an ugly looking contractor's substation to your <br/>
left when you reach this point, and the trail continues forward with a low <br/>
clearance warning posted along with the winter closing sign. The low <br/>
clearance is a ski elevator, and the trail runs underneath the tracks up the <br/>
mountain. After this, the last signpost directs you either to continue along <br/>
the Tom Blake, or to go forward up the Anaerobic Nightmare. Go up the <br/>
Nightmare, and the grade of the trail will increase noticeably. It's only .6 <br/>
miles to the end of the trail, at which point the trail forks both left and <br/>
right to intersect with the Government Trail. Look down the right fork, and <br/>
you will see a tree with a small yellow sign with simply says "Government" <br/>
Behind this tree is a small rock carin containing the Ghost Letterbox, at the <br/>
end of the Anaerobic Nightmare.<br/>
