Does anyone have suggestions for boxes that shouldn't be missed along the route?  We will have bikes but no car so our travel distance is limited by our energy level.  I plan to really relax but thought that a bit of boxing would enhance the trip and maybe convince some friends to become boxers with me.  <br/>

Thanks in advance for your help.<br/>

I have a box located in Waterford along the OLD CHAMPLAIN CANAL TRAIL, <br/>
as well as several others in the area all on bike trails. Visit my Bike <br/>
it or Hike it website at www.geocities.com/haalck@snet.net and look <br/>
