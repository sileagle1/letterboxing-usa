                    <div class="plaintext-content">Due to the sale of attbi to comcast, my website will be changing <br/>
providers from attbi.com to comcast.net after June 30. [I don't know <br/>
if this was all of attbi or just our area].<br/>
<br/>
 I changed my letterboxes on the LBNA site so they no longer directly <br/>
link to the web page as I am not sure that the switch will be hitch <br/>
free. (The clues should now show up with the normal LBNA parchment <br/>
background).<br/>
<br/>
If you are an attbi subscriber in the same situation, you may want to <br/>
take steps to ensure your clue are still available despite the <br/>
change. Those who are not such worrywarts as myself may just want to <br/>
try viewing their clues on the LBNA website after the changeover.<br/>
