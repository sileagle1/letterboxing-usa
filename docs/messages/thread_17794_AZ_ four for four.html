                    <div class="plaintext-content">Business in Tucson was naturally liberally sprinkled with letterbox hunts. Before I <br/>
headed out on this trip, I contacted the new and prolific Tucson boxer, AZroadie. We <br/>
arranged a meet over coffee but I wanted to be sure to find some of his boxes before <br/>
we met face to face. <br/>
<br/>
One of his offerings is hidden in the wonderful San Pedro Riparian Area. The day <br/>
before our scheduled meeting I decided to make this trek. It's about an hour and a <br/>
half drive from Tucson and well off the beaten path for most visitors except for <br/>
determined birdwatchers. I really didn't even expect to see another stamp in the <br/>
logbook. As it turned out, I was the second visitor since it had been placed last <br/>
November.<br/>
<br/>
That alone surprised me but the biggest surprise came when I unearthed the <br/>
letterbox from its hiding place. As I walked away to stamp in, a man approached me, <br/>
asking if I was a letterboxer. This was my very first encounter on the trail with <br/>
another of our wacky clan and who did it turn out to be? AZroadie, in the flesh, <br/>
checking on his letterbox!!!<br/>
<br/>
In addition to this box, I found two of his others: Arizona Mystery #1 and Tanque <br/>
Verde Falls. The fourth box that I found during this last week was the one hidden by <br/>
the Apple Dumpling Gang in Lincoln Park. I was unable to get to my boxes hidden in <br/>
AZ to check on them but I have had recent emails proving them to be in good health. <br/>
Naturally, I couldn't possibly leave town without leaving a new box behind. This little <br/>
gem is waiting at Sweetwater Wetlands.... Funhog<br/>
