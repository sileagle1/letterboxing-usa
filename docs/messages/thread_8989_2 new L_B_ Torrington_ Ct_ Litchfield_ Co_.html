Planted by Rubaduc 11-7-02<br/>
Easy 2 mile walk in Sunny Brook State Park<br/>
<br/>
Directions: On Rt. 4 west out of Torrington, turn right at the police<br/>
station onto Winsted Road. Straight through the next light then turn left<br/>
at the set of lights at the white church onto Newfield Road. At 2.4 miles<br/>
you'll see a sign on the right, at a bridge pointing out the John Muir<br/>
Trail. Just after the bridge on the left is the park entrance marked only<br/>
by stone pillars and a no littering sign. Plenty of parking.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Head south through the customary park gate on a paved road<br/>
crossing over a good sized bridge. When you come to a fork, take the<br/>
right fork to see the remains of what once must have been a thriving<br/>
state park. I poked around here for a bit then headed towards the left<br/>
end of the "old" parking lot to a dirt road. This leads to Torrington's<br/>
model airplane field and since no one was flying I walked around. If the<br/>
field is being used, take a left over the little bridge and come back to<br/>
the road you were on originally. If the field in not being used you still<br/>
need to cross that bridge when you come to it. When you're back on the<br/>
main road you're looking on your left for a secluded meadow (it's a<br/>
little over 200 paces-400 steps if you're so inclined to count) but I<br/>
don't think you'll miss it. Go into the meadow, hang a right and half way<br/>
through you'll see a many fingered tree (I just love letterboxing<br/>
vocabulary) behind the tree, under dam rocks is the Flutter Butter Meadow<br/>
Letterbox. Watch for the fluttering things and if nature doesn't provide,<br/>
you might be lucky enough to turn around towards the other meadow and see<br/>
man made ones.<br/>
The dam ahead of you is the old Newfield Dam and I was tempted to put a<br/>
box on top, except it could be a drive by from Newfield Road. If you want<br/>
to climb it for a look, the right side is pretty easy and rockless.<br/>
Head back the way you came to the first bridge (the bigger one) and just<br/>
after you cross it take a left onto the blue trail. There are blazes on<br/>
the left side on the pavement (unless there's snow cover) then you'll<br/>
have to look into the woods for the blazes. Before long you'll see a sign<br/>
on a tree on the right that says "Whites Nature Trail" and lots of blue<br/>
blazes. Stay straight on the trail, up a small incline till you come to a<br/>
brook with a cement culvert crossing, you can see the yellow trail ahead<br/>
of you on the left. Turn around, count 12 steps, look to your right and<br/>
under the back edge of a large round boulder is the Picnic in the Park<br/>
Letterbox. Stamp in, careful not to be seen, and rehide as found. Follow<br/>
the blue back to the road and your car. <br/>
I took many trails and there's some awesome hiking in here, but I<br/>
wouldn't recommend it with out a map. If you take the John Muir Trail at<br/>
the bridge, you can come out at Burr Pond State Park (in 4 miles).<br/>
Remember to wear orange there is hunting here.<br/>
