great sport.  The advent of high use fees in certain areas may be <br/>
a big disincentive to some less fortunate people.  <br/>
<br/>
Recently, at the South Sound Quest Fest gathering in Lakewood <br/>
Wa, Mischief graciously (along with several other individuals) <br/>
brought excess letterboxing supplies to be placed in a donation <br/>
box.  New people who came to the gathering were encouraged <br/>
to look into the donation box and take whatever supplies they <br/>
could use themselves.  At least one newbie recieved supplies <br/>
from this box at the event.  This is the spirit of giving and sharing <br/>
that all letterboxers possess.  We have all found an activity that <br/>
brings us great pleasure and promotes good health, we all want <br/>
to share this great activity with others.<br/>
<br/>
I propose that we take a collection from among our local <br/>
letterbox regulars that we could use to 'sponsor' new recruits in <br/>
the sport.  We could coordinate these sponsorships by having a <br/>
local letterboxer nominated as administrator  or a group elected <br/>
as a council and then when one of us finds someone that we <br/>
would like the group to help out, we could submit a sponsorship <br/>
recommendation for the administrator or  council to review.  <br/>
Funds collected could be used to pay for annual park passes for <br/>
the newcomers, purchase carving tools and media, log books, <br/>
compass, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
We could also use funds to sponsor events targeted at helping <br/>
those less likely to be able to participate in the sport get involved.  <br/>
Kids Day events, special events for the Physically Handicapped <br/>
or mentally disabled.  Another side benefit is that if we did these <br/>
types of events it may lend much credibility to our organization <br/>
when gaining permission to place boxes within certain <br/>
jurisdictions (ie NPS or State Park Systems). <br/>
<br/>
All the while, we can still as individuals, sponsor individuals by <br/>
lending tools, media, supplies, etc, and giving individuals the <br/>
gifts of yearly passes and such.  It may however, be easier for <br/>
those who are on limited funds to participate in the giving aspect <br/>
of the sport by  participating in a group effort.  There is a blessing <br/>
in recieving a gift but there is much more blessing in giving a gift.  <br/>
This may be a way for us to help those less fortunate recieve the <br/>
greater blessing of giving at a level that is appropriate to their <br/>
situation.  <br/>
<br/>
This is just my idea, I would appreciate some discussion on <br/>
this.<br/>
