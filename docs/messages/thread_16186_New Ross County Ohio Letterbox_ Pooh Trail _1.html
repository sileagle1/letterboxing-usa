Salamander. No. of boxes: 1. Difficulty: Easy. This is the first in <br/>
a series of letterboxes based on some favorite AA Milne characters.  <br/>
CLUES: Start at Strawser Park in Chillicothe, Ohio (corner of <br/>
Sycamore and Riverside streets).Use the paved path beside the <br/>
restrooms building to access the bikeway/pedestrian corridor. Head <br/>
east along the bikeway, going past a red metal gate, until you come <br/>
to a smallish stump which is about 12 feet off the path to your <br/>
right. Stop. Standing on the pathway opposite this stump take a <br/>
compass reading of 315 degrees. Twenty paces at this heading will <br/>
bring you to a double-trunked tree--- the box is hidden within the <br/>
root system at the base of the tree.<br/>
