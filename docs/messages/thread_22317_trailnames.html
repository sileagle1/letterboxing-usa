&gt; As an avid Internet buff (and as a youth minister who communicates via<br/>
&gt; Text and IM with my students), I am most familiar with screen names,<br/>
&gt; trail names, etc. (Just look at my email address).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, how do I go about convincing my wife (a non-techie, non-internet<br/>
&gt; type person) that she has to come up with a trail name?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, what is the protocol for signing a log book?  Is it JUST trail<br/>
&gt; name, or can you put an actual name in the book?  And if you're with<br/>
&gt; friends or family who are NON-letterboxers, can they sign their names?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; New to the hobby, I just want to do the right things.<br/>

Here's a fun way to create a trailname.  My daughter asked me questions when<br/>
I came up with mine.  Just a whole lot of questions that focused on who I<br/>
am, how I see myself, and what I want to do with this new identity I was<br/>
forging for myself.  Everyone loves to be paid attention to, and I'm no<br/>
exception, so by focusing so tightly on me for that short half hour, she<br/>
helped me make sure that this new name was the right one for me, and that it<br/>
would work.<br/>
<br/>
It sure was a fun exercise, sort of like going to a psychoanalyst, but more<br/>
fun, and it didn't cost a cent!<br/>
<br/>
And I do love my trail name, and it's just right for me, for a lot of<br/>
reasons--TrailsHome.<br/>
