<br/>
  Letterboxing began in America on April 26, 1998 with an orienteer from Suwanee, TN "seeding" a box on Max Patch, a "bald" in Madison County, NC.  (Another claim of the first box in America is at Prayer Rock in RI, but we won't quibble since we're not into competition in this hobby.)<br/>
<br/>
  Please celebrate 10 years of boxing in America where it all began.<br/>
<br/>
  Details including nearby accommodations etc. will be forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
  The event stamp has already been conceived and will be unlike anything yet done (as far as I know) in the US.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh - and BABE means Beginning [of] American Boxing Event.<br/>
<br/>
  If you want to be on the BABE mailing list for updates, please pmail me WITH "BABE" IN THE SUBJECT LINE at mountainscorpia@yahoo.com.<br/>
<br/>
  See you there!<br/>
