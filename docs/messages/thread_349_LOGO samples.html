                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is it acceptable to like all of them?  I like all of them.<br/>
They all pretty much have simple elements, memorable, shrinkable.<br/>
For the most part they can easily be made into a stamp.  Do we<br/>
have to have just one?  They all seem to have a similar theme.<br/>
Could we rotate them through the page?  I could put a different one<br/>
up every week for a few months while we figure out whihc one we<br/>
like best.  They're all so nice.  I don't know how you can pick just<br/>
one.  I'll be looking at them and think I like one, then all of a<br/>
sudden I will think I like another one better.  Then I will like<br/>
the one I liked before that.  The ones with wavy lines underneath<br/>
do remind me of water, but I really like water as an element.<br/>
I also like the chiseled (arrowhead) look of the "A".  The postal<br/>
elements are nice too.  I think the "L" needs to stand out a bit.<br/>
The ones of course with the whole word letterboxing no problem,<br/>
otherwise you need a hyphen or the little wavy lines like in 14<br/>
&amp; 15.  My preference is the non-italicized font because it is<br/>
slower and more relaxed but I like both.  I really like 2 &amp; 4<br/>
also - very innovative fonts, nice, pleasing to look at, but<br/>
hard to fit on a rubber eraser.  What if the name fits the logo<br/>
theme as well, so you would just remove the "etterboxing" part<br/>
to arrive at the logo?  That way it would have the feel of the logo.<br/>
It could be used in different places under different circumstances<br/>
depending on whether or not you want the full name or the simplicity<br/>
of just the symbol.<br/>
<br/>
Its nice of you Michelle to present all these different options.<br/>
I really like all of them.  I wonder what number 14 would look<br/>
like non-italicized in blue with a little bit more space between<br/>
the L and the U?  I like number 8a, also #3 (again, I like water).<br/>
<br/>
Nice choices.  Thank you very much.  I hope my ramblings help you.<br/>
