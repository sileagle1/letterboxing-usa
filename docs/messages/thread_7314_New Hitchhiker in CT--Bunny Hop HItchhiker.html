Bunny Hop Hitchhiker<br/>
<br/>
Placed August 31, 2002<br/>
By Magic Mike and Magic Scout<br/>
<br/>
First Placed in Wallingford, CT<br/>
<br/>
OKHeres a little background<br/>
<br/>
We are magicians.  And as a result, our assistants are bunnies.  Recently, <br/>
we lost one of our best assistants, Fido the Bunny.  Fido led a full and <br/>
happy life for a bunny.  He is best known for being a ham on stage and for <br/>
making people laugh and smile.<br/>
<br/>
We thought it would be a great idea if we sent the rubber stamp that we used <br/>
on our correspondence as Fidos likeness on a trip.  Fido would have liked <br/>
that!<br/>
<br/>
So, off he goes.  He was placed today in one of the many letterboxes in his <br/>
hometown of Wallingford, CT.<br/>
<br/>
It is hoped that the 20th person who finds Fido will return him home.  A <br/>
gift awaits that person.  The address is included in his logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Heres wishing Fido good luck on his journey!<br/>
