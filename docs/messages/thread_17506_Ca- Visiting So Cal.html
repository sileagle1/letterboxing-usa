I believe that you stamped in our" Wild Goose "near Willows so I will use that as a reference. If I'm wrong then you will just have to go out and find the"Goose" so you will know the reference. On I-5 near Stockdale Hwy about 40 ? miles north of hwy99 "Tule Elk" in Kern Co. is a drive by as was the "Goose". Several of Buzzards "Halloween series" in Pasadena are short hikes as is his "Humane Society"and Spaceyholly's "Swimming in Sierra Madre". There are others nearby but those placers should give you their input. If you continue on the 210 frwy to 605 frwy south then you can hit Jam&amp;Jelly's "Strange Stamp Series in Heritage Park". If you want to know about the Long  Beach area write me off list, as there are enough letterboxes there to keep you busy for several days. In the San Diego area "Jack Creek Falls" and "La Jolla" are very short hikes. Both "Batiquitos" and "Penasquitos" are longer hikes than what I've listed but very cool locations. Other San Diego locations are unknown so someone else will have to give you up to date info. In the Las Vegas area you should find Ryan's "Petroglyph" series as it is a really super area but not really a drive by If  you feel like driving a bit more then you might try for"Shotgun Shorty" just north of Mesquite in Arizona.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, there's a GREAT campground where the Petroglyph boxes are, <br/>
that are cheap and clean.  Even have showers.  =)  Which makes it a <br/>
great place to stop for the night and hunt down boxes before it gets <br/>
dark (or after it gets light).<br/>
<br/>
Also, there's free camping near my Arizona Hot Springs boxes.  It's <br/>
technically in Arizona, but very close to Hoover Dam that's maybe a <br/>
half-hour drive south of Las Vegas.  And the best part--hot springs <br/>
to soak in all night!  =)  The downside is that to camp there, <br/>
you'll have to hike all the gear you'll need in.  (Or, as Don and <br/>
Gwen would probably do it, canoe in along the Colorado River--which <br/>
is also fun.)<br/>
