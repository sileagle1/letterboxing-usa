Hi french fox<br/>
so now , I have written that question in my log book. When I see you I am
sure there will be one of those Senior Moments and I will forget the question
!<br/>
Any how, I carry my riddle with me and just hand it out to folks to chew
on for awhile. Most everyone catches it right away. But since you mentioned
it, I will tell it to you now.If you want to save it ??<br/>
<big><i>"I'm Slower" : <br/>
 </i>Getting older !!<br/>
When we meet on the trail now ---<br/>
A question asked ~~just ~~how ---<br/>
Will bring out my personal traveler.<br/>
<u>"</u><i>All needs on my back.'<br/>
'Four feet to make track."<br/>
</i>What is it ???<br/>
 <br/>
Butterfly.<br/>
<br/>
<i><br/>
</i></big><br/>
