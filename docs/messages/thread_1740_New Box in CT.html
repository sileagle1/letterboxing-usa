A Special Snowflake<br/>
Josias Byles Sanctuary<br/>
Distance: .09 miles<br/>
One Letterbox<br/>
Location: 0.5 Miles East of Route 44 and 89 Intersection in Ashford.<br/>
Across from North Animal Clinic.<br/>
Be careful not to block private drive. <br/>
<br/>
This Special Snowflake came to me<br/>
from someone I have yet to see.<br/>
<br/>
Yet we share a common bond<br/>
that same peculiar sport were fond.<br/>
<br/>
Crossing wet spots, checking rocks, <br/>
for the all elusive box.<br/>
<br/>
Hooked on thorns, tripped by rocks,<br/>
looking for that certain lair.<br/>
That contains a special prize,<br/>
Hidden in the Tupperware.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the parking lot, go straight.<br/>
Apple trees will be on your left, wire fence on your right.<br/>
At intersection follow yellow arrow to the right.<br/>
Either the deer are real smart and follow the yellow arrows or you are<br/>
on a deer trail<br/>
Passing threw a pine plantation, the stone wall will be on your right.<br/>
At next junction go Right on the road. Then take your next left.<br/>
A ravine will be on your right. <br/>
When it ends look for two large rocks across the ravine on your right <br/>
and two on your left of the path.<br/>
Stand between all four rocks. look south.<br/>
Spot the tree with three sisters.<br/>
Directly behind in the wall is your prize.<br/>
Continue along the yellow trail the way you havent been.<br/>
Follow the winding trail, left right up and down.<br/>
At what looks like an intersection go left. (Its not an intersection<br/>
its someones back yard.)<br/>
Follow trail over a wall.<br/>
Look for a large pine tree on your left.<br/>
When you reach the road go right, youll soon see familiar markings.<br/>
(And your vehicle.)<br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail comments and how the box is doing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Letterboxers! Finally after 2 months of Letterboxing, I've placed<br/>
my *FiRSt* box, "The Mystical Creature", in Sleeping Giant State<br/>
Park, Hamden, CT.!!! Yey! The hike is a bit of a work-out, but the<br/>
clues are pretty easy I think. (You can find the clues on LbNa<br/>
website, "what's new".)Enjoy the adventure!...Sue/sojourner.... <br/>
