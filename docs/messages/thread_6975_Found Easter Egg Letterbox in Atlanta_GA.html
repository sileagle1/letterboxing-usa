                    <div class="plaintext-content">August 9, 2002. Wife, Ellen and I came up from Tallahassee, Florida for<br/>
our first Letterboxing adventure. We got help with directions from our<br/>
friend George who works at the nearby university. We didn't expect to<br/>
walk so much but it was a pleasant day. As we walked along, Ellen asked<br/>
if I knew what I was doing with the compass, I whipped out my book "How<br/>
to use a Compass" and figured it out. Talk about learning on the fly.<br/>
The grounds of the park are very beautiful and we found the letterbox<br/>
relatively easily with only a few missteps. As an added bonus we found<br/>
the geocache also. We have been geocaching for a while so it was nice<br/>
to get that find also. I will say that letterboxing leaves you with a<br/>
greater sense of accomplishment. I have just hidden the first Letterbox<br/>
in North Florida and hope that Letterboxing gets as popular as<br/>
geocaching in our area.<br/>
