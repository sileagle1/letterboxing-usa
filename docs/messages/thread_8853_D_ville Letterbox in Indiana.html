It was the D'ville Letterbox in Indiana and I had the creator of it<br/>
come show me how to use my compass so i could find it. I am only the<br/>
SECOND person to find the letterbox! Apparently there were a couple<br/>
other people who looked for it but didn't find it because some<br/>
branches had fallen across the path and that stopped them before they<br/>
got to the right spot. It is hidden very well but not where people<br/>
would see it as they walk by. <br/>
