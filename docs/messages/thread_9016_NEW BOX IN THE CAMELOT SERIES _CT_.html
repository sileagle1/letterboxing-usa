Mattabassett Trail, Meriden CT<br/>

<br/>
There are three ways to access these: 1) Park at Mt.<br/>
Higby (Rt. 66) and cross the road; 2) Park at the<br/>
Black Pond boat launch (East Main St.) and use the<br/>
connecting trail; or 3) follow the suggestion in the<br/>
Witches Den (Durham CT) clue and walk up from Rt 68.<br/>
<br/>
Lancelot: Find this commanding viewpoint [photo]. Turn<br/>
away from the edge (85) and walk 13 or so steps to<br/>
the foot of a dead tree and some cedars.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that scene in the movie Excaliber, where<br/>
Arthur discovers his queens and first knights<br/>
betrayal and thrusts the sword down between their<br/>
sleeping bodies?<br/>
<br/>
Well, Excaliber remains between Lancelot and<br/>
Guinevere, so head in her general direction until you<br/>
come to a four-trunked oak on the left side of the<br/>
trail. Just a few steps to the north, peek behind a<br/>
two-trunked tree to find the famous swords hiding<br/>
place.<br/>
