                    <div class="plaintext-content">On December 9, 2001 Funhog placed the Empire Mine Letterbox near Grass<br/>
Valley in Nevada County, California.  For over one hundred years men and<br/>
mules toiled here thousands of feet beneath the earth's surface. They<br/>
drilled, blasted and hauled tons of ore in the quest for gold. Deadly<br/>
mercury and cyanide were used to extract the precious metal. The continuous<br/>
thundering of stamp mills crushing rock could be heard three miles away.<br/>
Today, the peaceful hiking trails of the Empire Mine State Historic Park<br/>
wend their way through the forest past the rusting, weathered remains of<br/>
many of the area's hard rock gold mines. At the Visitor Center you can<br/>
purchase ($1) a map of the Park's trails which contains interesting<br/>
information about the remnants of the mining era that you will see along<br/>
the trail.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: From highway 49 take the Empire Street exit and follow<br/>
the directional  signs for the Empire Mine State Historical Park. If you<br/>
begin your hike at the Visitor Center you will have the opportunity to see<br/>
the Empire Mine main shaft, assay office, owner's residence and vintage<br/>
mining equipment, well worth the $1 entrance fee. Follow the Hardrock Trail<br/>
toward Penn Gate. The loop is a little over 2 miles. Alternatively, you can<br/>
park at Penn Gate, .7 miles downhill from the Visitor Center, for a brief<br/>
half mile stroll to and from the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: Walking along the Hardrock Trail you will come to a <br/>
junction for the W.Y.0. D. (work your own diggins) Trail. Take this loop<br/>
trail. This mine leased sections to individual miners and was considered to<br/>
be very unlucky. Find the signpost with the unluckiest of numbers on it. At<br/>
this point you will see a hard box at 220 degrees and sharp strands at 5<br/>
degrees. Walk 24 paces toward the hard box to a trail junction. Look for a<br/>
ring of trees at 33 degrees. This is one time when a descent into<br/>
depression will be rewarding. With your back to the smallest of three<br/>
Ponderosas the letterbox  is in front of you at the base of a clump of<br/>
small trees.<br/>
