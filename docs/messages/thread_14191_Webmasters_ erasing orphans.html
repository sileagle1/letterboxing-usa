&gt; Since, as Randy states, the issue is that the webmasters do not want<br/>
&gt; the responsibility or liability for orphan boxes, the problem is<br/>
&gt; already solved by listing them as abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
I think it runs deeper than that.  If a landowner has an issue with a<br/>
box and they look it up and see it as "abandoned", they will contact <br/>
the webmasters anyway.  In the landowner's position, who would you flame<br/>
without contact info?<br/>
<br/>
Then, how do you respond to "why are you listing an _known abandoned_ box <br/>
on my land"?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a solution is for someone in the community to volunteer to be<br/>
the contact person for abandoned boxes, have their e-mail address there,<br/>
to field flames from the landowners, and to remove troublesome boxes, <br/>
since the responsible person cannot be contacted.<br/>
<br/>
Any volunteers?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure Wes could set the volunteer up as the "abandoned box responsible <br/>
party" and link their contact info into the system.  It really would be<br/>
the ideal solution; the simple reality is that since none of the webmasters<br/>
are responsible for these boxes in any way, none chose to volunteer for <br/>
this position.<br/>
<br/>
It was decided that all clues need a responsible contact person, so the<br/>
park people, landowners, etc., can report environmental impact, etc.  In<br/>
the long run, it will give us a better reputation if we don't frustrate <br/>
landowners who have legitimate concerns about the use of their land.<br/>
Previously, these reports where erroneously going to webmasters.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Since we are a "community" and a ".org" isn't it all of our decision<br/>
&gt; whether or not these clues should vanish? <br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, the people who pay the bills and put in the time at the website<br/>
decide how it is operated, and they are only deciding that the current <br/>
text vanish from the website, not that the boxes vanish, and not that the <br/>
platonic ideas represented by the text vanish.  I like to think there is <br/>
tremendous alignment between the webmasters and the community.  In this <br/>
case, however, where apparently that alignment is a bit skewed, it will <br/>
be up to the community to shoulder the burden, either thru coming up with <br/>
an ingenious solution, asserting responsibility for dealing with the <br/>
landowners and others hunting the boxes, or doing without.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I don't want to see these boxes go any more than the next <br/>
person; and I personally am not trying to "do anything fishy".  What on<br/>
earth is the person who said that thinking?<br/>
<br/>
