<div>How long or how often is the website updated. I 
am introducing this as a 4-H project at our initial meeting Sept. 20 I hope the 
clues I  post in the next few days could be up  for them to 
find.  If not I'll have to print them out and make copies, I prefer they 
learn to use the website.  There are 16 kids confirmed joing this year and 
as many as 25 if all who showed interest come, this will be a big boost to 
letterboxing. We have plans to plant 2 in Nova Scotia  near my parents 
cottage. Also going to Kentucky this fall , hope I have time to find a park to 
plant one in. Another 4-H leader who is a friend of mine in Idaho  I plan 
to send material so we can get it in their state too.  We are having great 
fun with this , thanks </div>

With a clue that irresitibly begins "Bump Bump bittem bottom wattum <br/>
chu, Bump bump bittem bottom wattum chu," you can bet any <br/>
agricultural amount you want to name that I'll post them to the <br/>
website TONIGHT!!!! I think this is absolutely the most wonderful <br/>
addition to the collection in recent farmyard memory! And if there <br/>
are 16 potential new letterboxers looking at the website this week, <br/>
we all gain immeasurably. Thank you for your brilliant idea and for <br/>
these wonderful letterboxes. Can't wait to get my own future farmers <br/>
out a-lookin' for these 4-H jewels.<br/>
