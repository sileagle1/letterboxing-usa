                    <div class="plaintext-content">We might be moving there next year-August of 2008. Ok, not *Dartmoor* <br/>
specifically, but England. Of course I plan many outings to Letterbox <br/>
Mecca. Seeing as UK is on the list, can I ask a few questions?<br/>
<br/>
1) Does 100 US finds "count"? It sounds like I can get a catalog anyway-<br/>
is that correct?<br/>
<br/>
2) Are all the UK boxes concentrated in Dartmoor? Can I just start <br/>
planting them around my house, (Cambridge area) a la the US way? <br/>
<br/>
3) Dartmoor clues are boring. There, I said it. If I plant boxes with <br/>
the American-style story/picture/cipher etc clues, am I violating any <br/>
sort of rule? Is it Dartmoor-style clues only in Dartmoor? Are there <br/>
list over there similar to this one where I will be soundly flamed?<br/>
<br/>
I am *so* excited to be in the same area (possibly) as the first ever <br/>
letterbox. I don't want to barge in and mess up though, so any light <br/>
you can shed on UK style boxing would be much appreciated!<br/>
