                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Letterboxing Zodiac consists of a 12 year cycle, each year of<br/>
which is named after a different letterboxer that imparts distinct<br/>
characteristics to its year. According to this legend, the year of a<br/>
person's birth is the primary factor in determining that person's<br/>
degree of letterboxing success and happiness throughout life. People<br/>
born in that year will become like that boxer, taking on its<br/>
characteristics and identifying with it for their entire lives. If <br/>
YOU are immortalized in this calendar, you have the qualities next <br/>
to your name, regardless of your birth year.<br/>
