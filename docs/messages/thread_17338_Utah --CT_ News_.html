hunt !! <br/>
Hope to see you in Utah and a big big thank you to all the CT<br/>

That's so awesome.   I am really trying to see if I can make it out <br/>
there, but I'm not sure yet if I can work it out.    It sounds like <br/>
so much fun.   So please keep me posted on the specifics.  Thanks <br/>
again for all your planning and EVERYONE's help.  =-)<br/>

Merry Christmas.<br/>

gathering.  One or two to plant, two hitchhikers, several traveling <br/>
event stamps, and a possible surprise or two besides.  This should be <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
I will also be talking to Butterfly to make final arrangements, but <br/>
Salt Lake got 1-3 feet, depending on the location, of snow dumped on <br/>
it yesterday.  We may look at some other ideas for gathering sites <br/>
rather than out in the cold.  We will post or email final plans in <br/>
the coming days.<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be so fun!<br/>
