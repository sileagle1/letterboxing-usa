I've got this right: you had TRIPLETTS and then went back for <br/>

This is what I think about Connecticut: it's just built right for <br/>
letterboxing. It's tiny, about the size of the county I come from in <br/>
California, but it's got alot of small parks set aside for hiking. <br/>
Connecticut (well, New England in general) was at the forefront of <br/>
the conservation movement at the turn of the century. So CT can now <br/>
claim more miles of hiking trails than many other much larger states. <br/>
The trails tend to be in "little" parks, 2 or 3 hundred acres, which <br/>
is ideal for letterboxing, where you can easily spend an hour or two <br/>
in the woods but may not want to do a three-day expedition. On top of <br/>
the little park packages, it's rocky here. REALLY rocky, which is why <br/>
all the smart farmers moved to Ohio way back when. But rocks, ledges, <br/>
and stone walls are terrific spots for hiding.....letterboxes! So, on <br/>
your way up to VT, don't hesitate to pull off and score a letterbox <br/>
or two here as well.<br/>

&gt; I've wondered why Connecticut has become as you say, letterboxing <br/>
&gt; heaven. It took about 4 times looking at that map for me to realize <br/>
&gt; just how many there were here as compared to the other states. And <br/>
&gt; it's basically just southeastern Connecticut. We're talking about <br/>
an <br/>
&gt; area of about 60 square miles. Why exactly has it worked that way? <br/>
&gt; Anyone have any clues or insight? I mean other than the drewclan <br/>
&gt; factor of course :-)<br/>

Hi Jay,<br/>
   My wife is definitely the hero of our family. I was on a ship for <br/>
the first three years of my triplet daughters lives. I'm sure you're <br/>
familiar with that scenario. She's pretty much done it all on her <br/>
own. Her family is in Maine and mine is in Vermont. Our youngest was <br/>
a failed attempt at a son. I wouldn't change anything though.<br/>
