<br/>
To all concerned:<br/>
<br/>
There is what I call a geographic interface at the Letterboxing USA<br/>
homepage: http://www.pclink.com/elf/letbox.htm<br/>
"Letterboxing maps" would also be an adequate description for it.<br/>
My thinking was that people will generally be interested in clues for<br/>
the letterboxes near them.  My assumption was that people would be able<br/>
to pick out an approximate location on a map to get clues for boxes<br/>
nearby.  If they are going on a trip I figured they would be able print<br/>
some clues for the area they are visiting (if they know they will not<br/>
have internet access, otherwise they can wait until they get there). <br/>
The fringe benefit is that they will have a map right on the clues sheet<br/>
to help them find the site.<br/>
<br/>
I'm wondering if the way this thing is starting to materialize works --<br/>
Do you think it works?  Do you feel that my assumptions were correct? <br/>
If not, what should I be doing to make it work better?  My hope is that<br/>
in the future you will be able to choose custom settings for your clues<br/>
pages, ie. colors, fonts, style, arrangement of text and images, map or<br/>
no map?  Do any of these things appeal to you?  Would you feel it<br/>
worthwhile to have a system where you have the option to layout your own<br/>
clues and images?  The mapping system of course would not have much<br/>
variability.  Its pretty much tied down by what's in the world.  But I'm<br/>
interested in your ideas nonetheless on how things should appear and<br/>
function on these pages.  What should things look like and how should<br/>
this work so it is as easy as possible to use?  One of my main goals was<br/>
to make this as no-nonsense and hassle free as possible. You can help me<br/>
to accomplish that by giving me your input.  How would you like this to<br/>
function in order for you to get the most satisfaction and enjoyment out<br/>
of it?  What would you like it to look like (aesthetically)?  Do you<br/>
like the idea of laying out your own clues if it can be done easily?<br/>
<br/>
The way it works now you are never very far away (while on the main<br/>
page) from a letterbox clue -- two clicks at most -- first the state map<br/>
and then the area with your boxes.  But I think if the state maps become<br/>
too dense with dots to distinguish between them I may have to introduce<br/>
an inermediate map (of a region) and from there you'd go to the<br/>
letterbox sites.  This may mean that you would need three clicks to get<br/>
to some of the clues.  Would that be OK or not?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm looking for input.  I want this page to be your page.  I<br/>
want you to tell me how you want it to work.  Tell me your ideas.  Don't<br/>
be afraid to make suggestions.  I'm anxious to hear from you.  Most of<br/>
my correspondence in the future will be along these lines so get used to<br/>
thinking about how you would like things to work and then expect some,<br/>
if not all of your ideas to materialize.  That's my goal: to make your<br/>
ideas for letterboxing materialize.  Nothing gives me more satisfaction<br/>
than to know that I have provided you good tools, not just to find your<br/>
clues, but to be able to express yourself artistically.  Of course I'm<br/>
not certain that I'll be able to provide everything you want, but I will<br/>
definitely try if you give me some input.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be contacting you in about a week or so to tell you what things you<br/>
have suggested that I think I will be able to accomplish.  Don't be<br/>
afraid to think big, but don't be shocked if I tell you that it may take<br/>
me a year or two to accomplish it. I really think I can do whatever you<br/>
ask though, so please ask!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your input.<br/>
<br/>
Dan'l<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  I'd really love to hear from some of you who never say anything.  I<br/>
don't care if you have boxes out yet or not.  Tell me how you would like<br/>
things to work WHEN you get your boxes out.  The system will be waiting<br/>
for you when you're ready and working how you would have wanted it to<br/>
work if you give me your input now.<br/>

Hi Daniel.  I like your approach to improving the Web page.  Here are my <br/>
thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
I like the maps you've done--I'm sure they will be helpful.  The process <br/>
doesn't seem too cumbersome at this point, and if you later need to add <br/>
an intermediate map, it still will be very simple to get the <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
This may seem like a weird thing for an artist to say, but I don't feel <br/>
one way or another about the aesthetics of the clues/maps.  I mean, <br/>
Times New Roman in black on a white background is fine with me!<br/>
Especially since if I'm going letterboxing, I'd probably print out the <br/>
clue (on my black-and-white laserjet at work) and lose all the color <br/>
anyway.  And then it'lll get folded up and stuck in a pocket...<br/>
<br/>
Hope this input helps.  Cheers! Bonnie McLaughlin<br/>
<br/>

I'm fixing to be late for work so I'm just skimming my mail LOL   No time to answer all or check up on the <br/>
map situation, but regarding the question above, it would certainly be fine with me to have to click 3  or <br/>
even 4 times vs. 2..... I think anyone who's ever used an atlas on the internet will be used to having to click <br/>
down to more and more specific regions to find what they are looking for. To me it seems the only <br/>
reasonable way to handle crowding on the maps, if and when that happens.<br/>
