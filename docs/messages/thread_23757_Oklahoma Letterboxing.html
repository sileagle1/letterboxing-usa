Haven't heard much about boxing in Oklahoma, so I don't know if <br/>
there's enough activity there for a gathering. But you might check <br/>
out the the LetterboxingMidwest group, which covers OK but doesn't <br/>
have a lot of members yet:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LetterboxingMidwest/<br/>
<br/>
Reminder: here are all the major US regional letterboxing discussion <br/>
groups, where planning and talk about local gatherings is more likely <br/>
to take place:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/links/?id=75<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you're always welcome to organize a gathering on your own, as well:<br/>

<br/>
This year we discussed another, possibly with Okies and some from<br/>
Kansas in the norther part of the state, but at that time there were<br/>
only about 6 active boxers. My family ended up going to a gathering in<br/>
Texas which we enjoyed.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen some other stamps in local logbooks but haven't really been<br/>
contacted by the boxers themselves, so I'm not sure how many boxers<br/>
are in the state.<br/>
<br/>
You can check the Midwest yahoo group mentioned.  We are attempting to<br/>
get some discussion started there.  <br/>
<br/>
Where are you boxing?  Are you interested in hosting or helping with a<br/>
gathering?  What time of year would you be interested in?<br/>
<br/>
We really enjoyed the gathering hosted by Mandy last year.  She worked<br/>
very hard and did a great job.  I believe I found about 50 boxes that day.<br/>
