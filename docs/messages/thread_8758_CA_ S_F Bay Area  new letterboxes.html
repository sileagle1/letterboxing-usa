<br/>
Location: Dry Creek Regional Park in Union City, CA<br/>
Parking: Park at the end of Tamarack Dr. which is off of Mission <br/>
Blvd. <br/>
The path starts at the Tamarack entrance. Walk along Meyers trail to <br/>
find the hidden rewards.<br/>
<br/>
Edith, Mildred, and Jeanette were sad that summer was about to end.  <br/>
The girls had picked all of the blackberries, and the creek had been <br/>
dry for months.  There wasn't much to do on this side of the ranch. <br/>
Their dad asked them to head out to the lower field to help repair <br/>
the fifth bridge of Dry Creek and said that he would be waiting <br/>
there. He would give the girls a ride home on the new tractor. <br/>
<br/>
When the girls got to the field, their father wasn't there. A couple <br/>
of old plows were to the right of the field close to the creek. <br/>
Lucky, their grandfather's horse, was hitched to the chain that hung <br/>
from the big sycamore tree near the bridge. The girls hollered for <br/>
grandpa, but he didn't answer. While Mildred and Jeanette headed off <br/>
to look for grandpa, Edith went over to say hello to Lucky.<br/>
<br/>
The morning clouds finally rolled away and even though it was late in <br/>
the day, it was hot.  Tired and hot, Mildred sat down on the plow <br/>
that looked like it was missing the seat.  Jeanette sat down on the <br/>
section of the big sycamore that had recently fallen. Jeanette loved <br/>
to play with lizards and one was climbing on a small rock that was <br/>
close to the fallen section at the base of the tree. Jeanette tried <br/>
to snatch the lizard, but the lizard was quick and hid beneath the <br/>
rock.  Jeanette picked up the rock and saw something.  <br/>
<br/>
 Just then Mildred screeched. Jeanette and Edith quickly ran to <br/>
Mildred.  Mildred had seen a snake slither out from under the plow.  <br/>
Looking by the right front wheel, Edith noticed something <br/>
glittering.  She started to pull the mysterious item from under the <br/>
leaves and branch but was interrupted by the sound of the tractor. <br/>
Grandpa and dad were back with more lumber.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the day the girls worked diligently and totally forgot <br/>
about their discoveries. It was only on the ride home that they <br/>
remembered what they had seen, and then it was too late in the day to <br/>
go back.<br/>
