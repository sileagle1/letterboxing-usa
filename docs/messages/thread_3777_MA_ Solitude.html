A newbie in Western MA, here.  My partener-in-crime and I were out east last weekend and we tried to find "Two Hearts" (which was successful--thanks!) and "Solitude."  We couldn't find this one.  Are there any updates to the clues we should know about?  <br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness for vacations!  Yesterday we did North Mt. Sugarloaf, and today we're heading up to Wendell State Forest.  Yippee!<br/>

&gt;Hello Everyone--<br/>
&gt;A newbie in Western MA, here.  My partener-in-crime and I were out east<br/>
last weekend and we tried to find "Two Hearts" (which was<br/>

any updates to the clues we should know about?<br/>

Hi, I was also in eastern Mass. last weekend (Sunday) and found both Two<br/>
Hearts and Solitude, as well as a few others in the area.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Buckaroo.  Glad to hear you're having a good letterboxing <br/>
vacation in Massachusetts. Until this weekend's rain, the weather has <br/>
been perfect for letterboxing!  Regarding the Solitude box, I found <br/>
that one in August.  Once you get to the location, it can take a <br/>
little while to find the exact hiding place, though.<br/>
<br/>
I hid the boxes in Wendell State Forest.  Three are very easy and a <br/>
couple are a bit trickier.  But with luck you'll find all five!  I <br/>
checked on them not long ago and am very sure they are all where they <br/>
are supposed to be.  I hope you enjoy hunting them!  <br/>
