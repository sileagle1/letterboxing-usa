On August 30, 2002 Funhog placed the Riverbend Letterbox at Oxbow Park
near Gresham, Multnomah County, Oregon. This park is located along the
Sandy River a short drive from Portland but it seems like a different world
altogether, with old growth trees and lots of wildlife. In the fall there
is the annual Salmon Festival, a perfect time to see the fish running.
Go midweek and you may not see another hiker! Just dont bother to bring
Fido or Fluffy. Pets are not welcome here.
</p><p>To the trailhead: head east on SE Division Street past Gresham to an
intersection marked with brown signs directing you to the park entrance,
day use fee required. Park near the boat ramp.
</p><p>To the letterbox: Walk into the campground to the amphitheater. Head
down the giants staircase toward the river. Take the first trail to the
left and head downstream. Pass bitumen, boats, benches and barbecues. You
may need to get short. Pass the rails but dont descend. Cross the lawn
and then ascend. Dont stop to build castles. Watch to your left for a
triple-trunked cedar. Go five steps behind where a bit of the river is
standing guard beside the letterbox. Move some moss.
</p><p><i>note: This park is also home to the Oxbow Series letterboxes, one
of which may be missing. Refer to the clues section of the Letterboxing
website.</i>
