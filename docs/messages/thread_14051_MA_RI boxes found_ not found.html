                    <div class="plaintext-content">Friday we ventured to World's End in Hingham, MA to look for the <br/>
Mostly Brambles box.  We found the spot where the box was hidden, but <br/>
the small pile of rocks contained no box.  The World's End, Planter's <br/>
Hill, and Rocky Neck boxes (which we originally found nearly two <br/>
years ago) were all in place, dry and intact.  Look out for the PI if <br/>
you're looking for the World's End box.<br/>
<br/>
Next we traveled all the way down to South Kingstown, RI, for the <br/>
Green Trails Quest: Trustom Pond NWR Otter Point Quest box.  It also <br/>
was in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday we knocked off the last of the Tree For All Seasons series  <br/>
Summer, in Dover, MA.  Thanks LoneMassWolf!<br/>
<br/>
Next we snagged the DW's Imprints box in DW Fields Park in Brockton, <br/>
MA.  Cool stamp.  It's in place, dry, and intact, but we have a few <br/>
suggestions to make the clues clearer: 1) the park doesn't open until <br/>
noon on weekends (road gates are closed and locked before that), <br/>
2) "65 paces" ~ 50 steps, and 3) "take the path at this rock, <br/>
continue on this path up hill until D W Fields imprints" = take the <br/>
path on the left at these rocks, take an immediate right, then a left <br/>
at the next intersection, up the hill to D.W.'s imprints.  We spent <br/>
quite a bit of time wandering around and puzzling over which way we <br/>
were supposed to go because of this last direction.<br/>
<br/>
Last, we finished off the Time Travels series with the E=MC2 bonus <br/>
box.  Another fine stamp from TeamGreenDragon.  Rustypuff (who used <br/>
to work in the Blue Hills and knows what she's talking about) <br/>
cautions that this is hidden in an area that is a perfect habitat for <br/>
rattlesnakes and copperheads, and finders should be very careful when <br/>
reaching into places where they can't see what they're looking at.<br/>
<br/>
We were going to do some more boxes in RI today, but the weather <br/>
forecast helped us to decide to stay in.  Perhaps we'll spend some <br/>
time in the kiddy pool!<br/>

Thanks for the clarification of the Brockton DW clues.<br/>
I am planning on bringing the Doctor that I work for<br/>
to this box with her son tomorrow after work for her<br/>
first experience in Letterboxing (outside of having to <br/>
listen to all my adventures). She is all excited and<br/>
wants to bring a "picnic" (I'm thinking we'll run in and<br/>
grab the box). I would like to have this be a good experience<br/>
for her. (After all, she IS my boss)<br/>
