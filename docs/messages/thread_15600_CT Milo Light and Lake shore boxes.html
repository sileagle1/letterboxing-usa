We discovered the Milo Light Preserve.  Does anyone know why it is <br/>
called that?  Anyway,all 4 boxes were found exactly where they were <br/>
supposed to be and in fine shape.  thanks to Drewclan, Butterfly, and <br/>
Lobsta Lady. From there it seemed logical to go get Lake Shore box at <br/>
Hopemead State Park.  This was a piece of cake, and we continued down <br/>
the hill to check out the lake- very pretty.  We saw a cool cave <br/>
built into a bank, but without a flashlight, I wasn't about to <br/>
venture inside.  there was alot of broken glass in the vicinity, and <br/>
I was worried about Toad's feet, so we left carefully.  It looks like <br/>
a popular party spot. It's strange,isn't it,that beer bottles aren't <br/>
too heavy to get somewhere, but seem too heavy to cart back out!!??? <br/>
Hmmmmmm.  Happy Boxing!- Sunshine and the Toad Dog<br/>
