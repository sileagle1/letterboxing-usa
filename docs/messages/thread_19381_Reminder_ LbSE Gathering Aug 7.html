<br/>
The 2004 SouthEast Gathering is coming up soon!!!<br/>
<br/>
One month from today, on August 7, 2004, we will be meeting, greeting, exchanging, laughing, searching, finding, and generally having more fun that people should legally be allowed to have. <br/>
<br/>
The event is being held at Stone Mountain Park, 15 miles east of Atlanta, GA. Letterboxers from AL, FL, GA, LA, NC, SC, TN and VA are already expected to attend, and we are hoping that folks from all over the USA will mark it on their calendars as well. We will be starting the day with an early-bird letterbox hunt, and winding down in the evening with a lasershow and fireworks (this alone is worth the $7 park admission; the lasers are blasted onto an 825 foot tall sheer granite face). <br/>
<br/>
There is tons of stuff for your non-letterboxing family members to do and see: they can ride the skylift and the locomotive; there is also a golf course, museums, paddleboats and a treefort. If you were not such a letterboxing fanatic, you would probably join them instead of spending all day improving your F, X, E and HH counts.<br/>
<br/>
There are currently 10 traditional letterboxes already in place at the park. We will be adding at least 10 more to that for the event (some planted, some not), a HH hostel, an Xtreme box, a Mystery Event box, and the usual exchange frenzy that can be expected at a gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Go to http://hometown.aol.com/redbng/2004SEG.html for details on the gathering and links to park maps and such.<br/>
<br/>
Hope y'all can make it! <br/>

P.S. If you are in possession of a traveling event stamp that can be mailed to me in time, please do! A few are already on their way from the Great Lakes Gathering, but that is the only set that has been promised. Are there any more that can come? Please email me.  -Red<br/>
