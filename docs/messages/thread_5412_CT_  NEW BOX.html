(Windsor, CT)<br/>
<br/>
Planted:  May 18, 2002 by Tom, Debbie &amp; Rebecca<br/>
<br/>
Length:  Parking lot to letterbox, under a mile<br/>
Difficulty:  Easy hiking trail <br/>
<br/>
Northwest Park is located in historic Windsor, CT. The park is a 473-acre <br/>
multi-recreational facility offering an interpretive nature center, 12 miles <br/>
of trails, maple sugaring, and more.  The Park is open daily, dawn to dusk <br/>
and there is no admission charge. <br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From Interstate 91 heading north, take Exit 38.  From Interstate <br/>
91 heading south, take Exit 38A.  Turn right at the exit on to Poquonock <br/>
Avenue (Route 75). Go about 1.5 miles and turn left on to Prospect Hill Rd.  <br/>
Turn right at the traffic circle on to Lang Road and continue up the road to <br/>
the Northwest Parking area.  Proceed from parking lot to the red barn Nature <br/>
Center, where trail maps are available.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HELP!  "Slow Poke" the turtle escaped from the Nature Center.  Please help us <br/>
find him. If you exit the Nature Center, walk northwest toward the path in <br/>
the woods which will lead you to the Bog Trail (red).  Climb the slight <br/>
incline, stop and have a snack at the lovely picnic area on your right.  <br/>
Continue on the path and turn left (west) following the sign for the Bog <br/>
Trail.  Passing a swamp on your right, you will soon cross a main trail, <br/>
proceed toward the Bog Trail (red).  Following the rope fence, the sounds of <br/>
Spring were in the air as you approach the bog.  A very noisy place to rest <br/>
as those 'peepers' can loudly croak.  Oh what a racket in Spring!  Cross over <br/>
a log bridge.  Continue on the path going up a hill, to the highest elevation <br/>
on this trail.  Follow the curves and down a steep hill.  Continue along the <br/>
Bog Trail, following the rope path.  Soon you will bear right, and see a hut <br/>
on your left.  Go in and check out the birds that visit the Park.  Come back <br/>
down the ramp.  Look to the North, there will be a group of pines with some <br/>
white birch logs on the ground.  'X' marks the spot!  Once you locate "Slow <br/>
Poke", stamp in and hide him for others to find.  Proceed north, taking a <br/>
right back to the main trail which will lead back to the Nature Center.  Or <br/>
venture off onto the other great trails.<br/>
