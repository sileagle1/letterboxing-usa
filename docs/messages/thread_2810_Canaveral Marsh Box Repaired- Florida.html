know the Canaveral Marsh box has been repaired and is back in place. <br/>
In addition there is a surprise nearby that I will make public <br/>
sometime next week. Meanwhile if anyone is actually planning on <br/>
visiting the box this weekend, contact me off list before I leave <br/>
town for the weekend and I will give you more info.<br/>
<br/>
There are definitely bears, boars, and gators in the marsh as well as <br/>
mucho cattle. I have never actually stumbled upon a bear out there, <br/>
but have seen tracks on many occasions. I have seen many boars and <br/>
gators. There is supposably even a Florida Panther or two that have <br/>
been sited out there (I would pay some bucks to see that as they are <br/>
VERY rare).  The cattle are the most likely danger. Contrary to what <br/>
some people think, cattle are not necessarily docile and bulls will <br/>
definitely attack if you irritate them somehow. That said, most of <br/>
the boars, gators, and cattle are usually well away from the trail <br/>
where this box is located. They are usually closer to the river. If <br/>
you get lucky you might see some deer that frequent the area.<br/>
