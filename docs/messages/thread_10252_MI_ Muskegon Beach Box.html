adopting the Muskegon Beach Box located at Lake Harbor Park in <br/>
Muskegon.  It was reported some time ago that the stamp is missing.  <br/>
I pulled the box today and will be carving a new stamp for it and <br/>
then replacing in the same location.  Fortunately I had visited <br/>
before the stamp went missing so I have an image of what it looked <br/>
like and will try to duplicate the original stamp.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the box was found by a geocacher as the stamp is gone <br/>
and there is a little compass-like trinket in the box that was not <br/>
there when I previously visited.  The box was not clearly identified <br/>
as a letterbox, but I would think it would have been obvious from the <br/>
log book.  I will label it, and will post to the list when the box is <br/>
replaced in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Arbo, if you are reading this...  it is not my intent to step on any <br/>
toes, I just don't want people to keep tracking down a box without a <br/>
stamp.  Please contact me offlist.<br/>
