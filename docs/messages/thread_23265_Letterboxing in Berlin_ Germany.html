Hiding in an urban setting is tricky. A different<br/>
stategy is called for, smaller box with more<br/>
camoflage. Good luck, I tried boxing in Paris found<br/>
some locations but couldn't retrive the boxes, too<br/>
high off the ground too public. Probably could have<br/>
gotten them after dark.<br/>

It says there are 2 boxes listed in Berlin but only the clues for <br/>
one of them actually works.<br/>
<br/>
Going to geocaching.com I've found several dozen hybrid <br/>
GC/letterboxes. One that's close to Berlin is:<br/>

<br/>
Berlin's my old stomping ground!  Lived there as a kid.  You can <br/>
find forested areas in the city in such areas as The Gruenewald <br/>
(take Ubahn Line 2 to Oskar Helene Heim and then Bus Number 10 or <br/>
walk a couple of kilometers West I believe--the forest will be to <br/>
the South--unless they've built that area up in the past 20 years) <br/>
in the 'former' American Sector (I believe it's the Dahlem <br/>
District), the Tiergarten Area (more towards the downtown area--not <br/>
terribly far from the Zoo) or Schloss Charlottenburg (the former <br/>
British Sector) has quite a few parks.   There are a couple more <br/>
large-ish parks not too far from the Thielplatz Ubahn Stop--leave <br/>
the station and cross the street in either direction and there <br/>
should be large green areas there.  One's behind the Harnack Haus <br/>
which is where Einstein, Max Planck &amp; several other famous <br/>
physicists often met and the other's just a large neighborhood park <br/>
that has awesome sledding hills, a large lake with some walking <br/>
paths.  If you can make your way out toward Potsdam then there are a <br/>
bunch more 'suburban' type parks out and about.  Germany however is <br/>
a very meticulous society so finding any 'casual' spots to plant <br/>
Tupperware tubs that would survive a long time will be challenging.  <br/>
There are also tons of little neighborhood parks that might serve <br/>
your purposes well.  I can visualize several potential hiding spots <br/>
on the 'East' side, too--but can't recall if they built up those <br/>
areas or not since I was last there in 97.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
