Try to look for a map of the Nuts. The third one is tricky with the<br/>
clues. Get it in your head first, know what I mean ?? Also pre-check on<br/>
the snowman.  Two parts were missing when Bluebird and I were there, and<br/>
Letterboxer 2002 just reported that the park wants them put back in a<br/>
different spot. So the clues you have not will not work.<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not a lot of snow in most places, maybe a few inches of <br/>
slushy stuff. It's deeper on northern exposures and places <br/>
which don't get a lot of sun, or which drifted.<br/>
<br/>
It's supposed to be warm, so make sure your boots have a <br/>
fresh coat of waterproofing. You can bet on walking through a <br/>
lot of water.<br/>
