                    <div class="plaintext-content">As my vacation grows nearer, and I struggle to carve two stamps for <br/>
the letterboxes my wife and I will be placing in Canada next week, I <br/>
feel I should weigh in that I don't think people should feel <br/>
pressured to carve their own stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel that if it gets people out there placing (and hunting for) <br/>
letterboxes, then go ahead and buy one!  But I do recommend making <br/>
the effort to find a unique stamp to buy, one that evokes something <br/>
about the location in which the box is hidden (or the clue that leads <br/>
to it).  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I'm a little biased, because, although I have carved my <br/>
own stamp for stamping in letterboxes I FIND, I am struggling with <br/>
trying to carve the stamps for the boxes I am placing.  So I am now <br/>
leaning toward using store-bought stamps.  My wife recently visited <br/>
the stamp store in Essex, CT, mentioned on this board, and she bought <br/>
several stamps.  I'm leaning toward forgoing the carved stamps, at <br/>
least for these first two boxes.  I will try to carve them for any <br/>
future boxes I place.  <br/>
<br/>
I know the FAQ at http://www.letterboxing.org also says that it is <br/>
not necessary to carve your own stamp, but I just felt it was good to <br/>
affirm that letterboxes without hand-carved stamps are not inferior <br/>
to those that do have them. <br/>
<br/>
OK, I feel better now!  I've already decided where I'm placing one <br/>
letterbox (on Cape Breton Island, in Nova Scotia), but I haven't <br/>
nailed down the one for Prince Edward Island.  There isn't a whole <br/>
lot of information on hiking trails in PEI.  If anyone finds anything <br/>
in the next few days, please let me know!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Chris, I agree: there is no such thing as an inferior letterbox! Some <br/>
are excruciatingly difficult while others seem easy but are really <br/>
harder than they look, and some are no-brainers. The easy ones with <br/>
store bought stamps are just as fun to find as hard handcuts. We've <br/>
put out a BUNCH of storeboughts and will surely do more of them in <br/>
the future. I really love personal stamps that are handcut too, but <br/>
my whole family is still using our commercially made ones: people <br/>
just recognize them. The vandalized letterbox I miss the most (Land <br/>
Sailing, in Newport) had an exquisite commercial stamp...<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, don't discount your own hand-to-eye coordination or <br/>
your innate creativity. The stamps you make don't have to be <br/>
masterpieces to be enjoyed by the folks who collect them!<br/>

Can't wait to see your clues,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Boxing is the objective - the creating, the placing, the clue<br/>
writing, the hunting, the hiding and, oh yes, the stamps.  The stamp is<br/>
a small part of the WHOLE.  It becomes relevant only because its image<br/>
represents the adventure.<br/>
<br/>
    Please don't allow yourself to be contained or stressed by a small<br/>
part of the process.  I carve stamps, I also admire the artistry in some<br/>
of the finer commercially made stamps who can achieve fines not usually<br/>
possible in a carved stamp.  They all have their place, which is to make<br/>
YOU happy.  Others are made happy by finding the box.<br/>
<br/>
    One of our biggest letterboxing pleasures is checking on our boxes<br/>
and enjoying the stamps and notes of  visitors.  I hope your boxes will<br/>
be placed somewhere that you will be able to get back to them and enjoy<br/>
the same happy times.<br/>

    You might also want to look on the www.letterboxing.org website<br/>
under "JOIN" and then "getting started".  There you will see a photo of<br/>
a British collectors book full of commercially made stamps!  Our first<br/>
contacts with our British compatriots included lots of advice for<br/>
purchasing stamps or having them personally made.  They seemed a bit<br/>
surprised when many of us were so interested in carving stamps.  Don't<br/>
be overly concerned about the stamp, enjoy!<br/>
