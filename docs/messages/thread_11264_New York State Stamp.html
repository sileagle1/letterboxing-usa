Directions: From Interstate 395 North or South take exit 96 from south<br/>
take a left,and coming from the north take a right at the end of th exit<br/>
ramp.You will soon come to a stop sign,go straight and you will see the<br/>
Grove Street Cematary on the left pull in the main entrance and drive<br/>
straight down the middle. Near the back you will turn left go a little<br/>
ways more and you will take  right and go up a hill the road will make a<br/>
loop drive to the back of the loop and park.In the distance you will see<br/>
big rocks up againstt the fence off to the left before the rock you will<br/>
see four trees growing from the same base. the New York box is between<br/>
those trees and the fence behind it.Please rehide well this is a highly<br/>
walked area.We thought, take in light of what happend on september 11<br/>
2001 that it would be appropriate to put the New York Letterbox in this<br/>
beautiful cemetery.on your way out passing all those grave sites<br/>
remember all the people that died that day could just about fill this<br/>
cemetery.The NeeDeeps   <br/>
