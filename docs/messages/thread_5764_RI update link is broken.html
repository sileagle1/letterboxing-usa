Here is a copy of the clues to ASA Pond in RI the link is broken.<br/>

ASA POND LETTERBOXES<br/>
PEACEDALE, RHODE ISLAND<br/>
<br/>
PLACED:  January 12, 2002<br/>
              By Hannah age 6 <br/>
              Katherine 4 (with a little help)<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Peacedale, RI<br/>
<br/>
RATING:  easy, good for kids.  Be prepared for shiggies.<br/>
<br/>
DRIVING DIRECTIONS: From Rt. 138 in the village of Kingston, take Rt. 108 <br/>
South.  Go straight at the traffic light.  Drive about 1/2 mile to a small <br/>
parking area on the right for Tri Pond Park.  It is just before the Pump <br/>
House Restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  Follow the yellow blazed trail west, keeping the pond on your left.  <br/>
At the first intersection take a right and cross the wetland on a long wooden <br/>
boardwalk.  Follow the trail to the next  bridge and count that as 1.  <br/>
Continue on keeping track of the bridges (do not count the many planks and <br/>
logs that have been laid over the muddy areas).  <br/>
    There is a tree with 4 trunks that makes a snug nest for a child or two <br/>
just before the third bridge.  Stand at the near side of this bridge and walk <br/>
18 paces at 10 to a decent-sized rock leaning on a tree.  In the crevice you <br/>
will find your prize.  Stamp in then continue on the trail.  <br/>
Continue on the trail.  After the 4th bridge (which is a double plank) there <br/>
will be a series of plank crossings.  In the midst of said crossings, the <br/>
remnants of an old stone wall stumbles across the trail at a yellow blaze.  <br/>
Look toward the brook.  There is a medium-sized 5 trunked tree.  Amongst its <br/>
roots you will find a little gnome house.  Stamp in and please rehide <br/>
carefully. It is a 5 minute walk to the Asa Pond Dam or turn around and head <br/>
back to your car.<br/>
