A yes narrows the field by 60%, but a no gives only marginally more <br/>

town starts with "S".<br/>

I'll decide my question later today, but am curious along what lines <br/>

It has been a while since we got a "yes" answer. However, back on Q9  it was <br/>
confirmed to be in "Essex, Middlesex or Worcester Counties". Then  Q10 ruled <br/>
out Worcester County. There is no place in Essex or  Middlesex County that is <br/>
not part of a city or town. <br/>
<br/>
But I would feel better if we got a yes for out next answer.<br/>

answers are working just as well as yes answers at this point.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, as a MA native, I have never seen a place in MA that is not <br/>
defined by a town/city.  We even pride ourselves on our unique town <br/>
signage! ;)<br/>
<br/>
Combination questions are working pretty well, as in combining "Is <br/>
it in Essex county, or in "x" town"?  BTW that was not my idea but I <br/>
like it.  Of course, if we get a "yes" answer then that would not be <br/>
as beneficial as  "no"....<br/>
