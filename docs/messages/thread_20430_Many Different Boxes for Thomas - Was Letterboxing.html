<br/>
As Jeff suggested, I am going to post my paypal address here.  If any of<br/>
you are interested in donating, I know the family would be overly<br/>
greatful.    dscott5377 at earthlink dot net.  Every penny that is<br/>
donated will go directly to Thomas for therapy.  Paypal charges me $0.30<br/>
plus 2.9% of each transaction - I will make up that difference so that<br/>
your entire donated amount goes to Thomas' therapy.<br/>
<br/>
All of the responses I have gotten have been wonderful!  This is a group<br/>
of very caring people!!<br/>
<br/>
As I stated in the other email that wasn't for the group - I am also<br/>
going to be doing a PLB that will require a donation to get put on the<br/>
list.  You will not be required to make that donation till the letterbox<br/>
is only 5 stops before you.  If you are interested, please email me<br/>
provately at dscott5377 at earthlink dot net.  I don't normally post<br/>
PLBs on this list anymore, but the response has been so great, I thought<br/>
I would for this one.<br/>
<br/>
I am also trying to figure out how to do a virtual box... only I have<br/>
never done one, or solved one - so if you have, I would love to hear<br/>
from you!<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I will also be sending out a HH.  It will include Thomas' story<br/>
as well as my paypal address for anyone who may want to donate.  Of<br/>
course, the HH won't have that requirement... it will be on a as wanted<br/>
basis.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you have any other great ideas, I would love to hear them!<br/>

<br/>
Or perhaps for the truly avid letterboxers, place your paypal <br/>
address in the box (or online, just for anyone who cares to donate <br/>
regardless ), and for the clues to a bonus box, paypal a donation to <br/>
you :) I guess in that case everyone comes out in good shape. Or <br/>
could always just flat-out post a letterbox either here or on lb.org <br/>
with the situation, and for the clues, paypal you $5. However you go <br/>
about it, it's a noble thing to do, good luck. <br/>

question to the group and hope I don't get a<br/>
&gt; mailbox full of nasty emails.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would it be out of Etiquette to make a LB to honor someone that <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; require a $5 (or more) donation?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me explain.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My neighbor's son (he is 2) has a very rare disease that has left <br/>
him<br/>
&gt; completely disabled.  Horse therapy (I can't remember the correct <br/>
name)<br/>
&gt; is a wonderful thing for disabled kids.  Thomas was able to go for <br/>
5<br/>
&gt; sessions this summer.  However, their insurance company changed <br/>
their<br/>
&gt; mind about covering this therapy and they were left with a $500 <br/>
bill.<br/>
&gt; Thomas LOVED this therapy, and they saw a wonderful change in his <br/>
motor<br/>
&gt; skills.  But, having 4 children (10 yr old twins, a 5 year old and<br/>
&gt; Thomas who is 2) and only one income, they can't afford to continue<br/>
&gt; sending Thomas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My thought would be to put a box at the center and ask for a <br/>
mandatory<br/>
&gt; donation of at least $5.00 in order to stamp in.  ALL of the money <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; go towards the $100 sessions for Thomas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would you visit the box even if it meant making the donation?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you all in advance for your input.<br/>

happen. <br/>
<br/>
I know, could haves are a waste of time BUT while this box &amp; <br/>
certainly this cause are, I'm sure, genuine (&amp; I'm not in any way <br/>
suggesting that they aren't) there is the potential here for a less <br/>
scrupulous person to start a "charity box" of their own... you see <br/>
where I'm going here.<br/>
<br/>
I would caution you to have all of the checks made out to the school <br/>
or charity directly, to keep yourself above reproach &amp; to keep cash <br/>
out of the mix entirely.  I would also encourage you to keep pay pal <br/>
out of it unless you set up an account specifically earmarked for <br/>
the benefit of Thomas &amp; his lessons &amp; NOT in your name.  <br/>

Just my two cents worth.<br/>
