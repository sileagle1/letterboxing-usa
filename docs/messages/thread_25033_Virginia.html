<br/>
After taking a quick shower, I threw my gear on the back seat of the brand new shiny silver Lincoln Towncar and made tracks to Dumfries, Virginia. Dumfries, being only 1.63 miles in size, might not seem like a very exciting place to visit, but I had my reasons. William Grayson came from this small town. There is even a bandstand named after him. For those of you who don't know the name, he was an important figure of the Revolutionary War. Not only that, the annual Christmas parade was on December 8th. Come to think of it, Dumfries was not that exciting in December. Heard they had a bit of excitement back in the summer though, when TeamGreenDragon came for a visit. Seems the male half of the team was busy keeping kids off the town lawn. Chased after the little tykes with a walking stick, screaming something about a Sony game. <br/>
<br/>
My next destination was the Ellwood Estate. Stonewall Jackson's arm is buried here, in a field, with a marker. Not sure exactly why. Stonewall was not shot here, nor was his arm amputated here, nor did he die here, nor was his arm originally buried here. It was exhumed and reburied at this spot in 1929.  Is there a reason for this?<br/>
<br/>
I drove on to Hopewell in the brand new shiny silver Lincoln Towncar, which was no longer shiny. The Audubon Birdathon needed volunteers and I was in for the count. I joined up with a team, in the pouring rain, at The Presquile National Wildlife Preserve. We walked all day counting birds; even saw two Greater White-fronted Geese, a first for this area. Should I remind you, this was in the pouring rain. Tell me I am not dedicated.<br/>
<br/>
Christmas in Mount Vernon was an unforgettable experience. Martha Washington was a swell host. After the tours of the grounds and all the other tourist trappings, I had the pleasure of dining with the Mrs. and her husband George. The plum porridge was worth the four helpings, and the Christmas pie - that was something else. Something to write home about; not sure about the eating part. For those of you who are wondering what exactly is in a Christmas pie, it includes a turkey, a goose, a chicken, a partridge, a pigeon, two woodcocks, a grouse, a rabbit, and whatever other bird one feels like throwing in. Why a rabbit? Seems a little strange to me. But, I did not come here to talk about bandstands, arms, birds or pie; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing in Virginia is thriving; especially the drivebys. Come on, you are a hiking state; the AT goes right through you. Maybe you should change your slogan to "Virginia is for Drivebys." The mysteries are right up there though, almost to 100. Not bad, not bad at all. Of course, 13% of them are drivebys. Good news is the boxes are well-covered and in nice locations. When hiking, be prepared, because your safety depends on it. In the summer Virginia is hot and humid, perfect for dehydration. Drink water before and during your hikes. Severe thunderstorms are likely to occur even on the nicest of days, so find shelter if a storm pops up. In the winter Virginia is cold and windy, perfect for hypothermia. Dress appropriately. Virginia is a state well worth letterboxing in. Bring hiking boots, and your car. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

According to online Merriam-Webster -- the plural of drive-by is drive-bys. Maybe the hyphen makes the difference.<br/>

 or at least drivebies ... which really looks wierd.<br/>
<br/>
 According to online Merriam-Webster -- the plural of drive-by is drive-bys. Maybe the hyphen makes the difference.<br/>
<br/>
 But then standby is standbys<br/>
