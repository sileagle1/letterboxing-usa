Looking for the "best" way to post clues - especially so that they ultimately <br/>
appear as clear and graphically appealing as those on the letterboxing.org <br/>
site.<br/>
<br/>
Have 4 boxes hidden now in southern NH.  Several others completed and ready <br/>
to be hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, I led a childen's summer day camp this summer and tought 115 <br/>
young people about the hobby - including provision of complete boxes, and <br/>
completed stamps (of varying quality).  To each I gave this web site.  I'm <br/>
hoping that some will follow up and hide / share their info.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to getting mine out on the web - looking forward to your <br/>
suggestions!<br/>

Congratulations on your four new boxes and welcome to the list! It's <br/>
great to have another New Englander on board.<br/>
<br/>
Getting clues up is no problem. Lone Wolf outlined the possiblities <br/>
very clearly. I will contact you off list with more setails and some <br/>
suggestions. I'll also let you know about a letterbox gathering <br/>
coming up in Killington Vermont in early November.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

I think Tom C. will probably be in touch with you soon.  He's our NE website guru.  Basically you have a couple of alternatives:<br/>
1. create webpages (a lot easier than you think; we can talk about that if you'd like) and then just submit the URL to the list and they'll get linked to the map.  AOL gives you 10 Mb of space to use for this purpose.  That's what I've done with my clues (see: http://members.aol.com/johndewolf/clues/home.htm)<br/>
2.  Create the webpages , e-mail them to the list, and our webmasters will post them for you<br/>
3.  E-mail the clues to the list and the web gurus will take it from there.<br/>
<br/>
How did you find out about letterboxing?<br/>

Welcome aboard!<br/>
I see that Tom and John have replied to your posting questions - they<br/>
have far more technical skills than I. As do many others on this list!<br/>
<br/>
It was great to hear of someone spreading this hobby to kids - and to<br/>
115 no less? Wow. Do you know if any of them have followed through<br/>
placing boxes?<br/>
<br/>
I live in the Champlain Valley (VT), and often travel to north central<br/>
Mass, so you can be assured that I'll find my way to those boxes<br/>
eventually! <br/>
<br/>
New England is becoming a Letterboxing Mecca of sorts.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us all posted..<br/>
