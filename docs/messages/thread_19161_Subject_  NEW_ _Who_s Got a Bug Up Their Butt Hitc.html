                    <div class="plaintext-content"> We've got Bugs!  We've got Parasites!  We've got a Postal Lb. that's<br/>
really a Hitchhiker Hostel ready to make the rounds to a mailbox near<br/>
you.  The "Who's Got a Bug Up Their Butt Hitchhiker Hostel" PLB that's<br/>
been . . . *GASP* . . . infested with the Little Parasites That Could<br/>
from Leapin' Lizards.  <br/>
<br/>
This Letterbox Hostel comes equipped with Hitchhikers .... and right<br/>
now there is a parasitic convention going on inside!<br/>
<br/>
Leapin' Lizards and I hunkered down, plotted and planned, and now are<br/>
just itchin' to bring you a whole new concept in Postal Letterboxes<br/>
(and Parasites)!     <br/>
<br/>
HOW PARASITES WORK:<br/>
Parasites are little critters that infect the host Letterbox logbook<br/>
and Hitchhiker logbook (with its stamp impression) and then moves on<br/>
with the Hitchhiker.  <br/>
- Or, when dropped off in a HH Hostel the Parasite infects _ALL_ the<br/>
HH in the Lb. while waiting for the next ride out.<br/>
- The Parasite always infects every logbook it comes in contact with.<br/>
- The Parasite can only move with Hitch Hikers (sort of a HH to a HH).<br/>
<br/>
HOW THE HITCHHIKER HOSTEL WORKS:<br/>
-It starts out salted with Hitchhikers and parasites.  <br/>
-The first 5 people on the list get to stamp the parasites but can't<br/>
take one (this way more people get to see them) even if they exchange<br/>
Hitchhikers.<br/>
-The next 5 people on the list each get to take one if they have a HH<br/>
to exchange.<br/>
-The 6th and last parasite will always stay with the HitchHiker Hostel.<br/>
-You can only take a HH if you leave a HH; exchange one for one.  If<br/>
you don't have one (HH) then treat this PLB like any other PLB with<br/>
the "Who's Got a Bug Up Their Butt" PLB stamp, exchange stamp images<br/>
and mail it on to the next person on the list.    <br/>
-You are encouraged to make a Hitchhiker, even a Parasite, for the<br/>
occasion, so start plotting.<br/>
-The "Who's Got a Bug Up Their Butt HitchHiker Hostel" PLB can only<br/>
stay for a day or two because this box intends to find out just<br/>
exactly Who's Got a Bug Up Their Butt !<br/>
