boxes go missing.<br/>
<br/>
General Analysis of Survey Results:<br/>
<br/>
To help ensure that a letterbox does not go missing, letterboxers do <br/>
not leave the burden on the finder to rehide the box well. They place <br/>
the box behind brush, under rocks, deeply in a forest, and well off <br/>
the usual paths. Experienced letterboxers do not rely on loose cover <br/>
materials to hide the box; they employ techniques such as camoflaging <br/>
a box with burlap or cammo tape, making it a smaller box, and hiding <br/>
it better. <br/>
<br/>
To absolutely ensure that a letterbox does not go missing, some <br/>
letterboxers only publish mystery clues, or no longer publish their <br/>
clues at all, under the assumption that boxes go missing because of <br/>
inexperienced new letterboxers or malicious anti-letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Although most letterboxers agree that better education of new <br/>
letterboxers is needed, few respondents have taken major steps in <br/>
that direction. <br/>
<br/>
The results are posted in the Files section of the Letterbox-USA <br/>
Yahoo! Group.<br/>
