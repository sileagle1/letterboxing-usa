(Jan/Feb 99) in the Surf City column:<br/>
<br/>
 - International Letterboxing Club, www.letterboxing.com/Read<br/>
   all about it - scavenger hunting with a rubber stamp focus.<br/>
<br/>
They had both addresses ILC and LUSA. Competion for space is<br/>
tough - I guess there was not room to run lots of site addresses<br/>
so they opted for the one with letterboxing in the url. I know<br/>
the author of the column had been to both sites. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Randy for all of your work on the new site - I think it <br/>
is very timely.<br/>
<br/>
I have FIVE more boxes ready to place !!!!! Hopefully that will<br/>
happen this week - I know Julie can hardly wait.  I stole Julie's<br/>
idea - with her permission - and made the stamp for each box in<br/>
a different shape. I have to say I was thinking of Deborah and<br/>
her box as I was carving all of the WORDS on the stamps. Words are <br/>
very tedious and I would hate to have it go missing. But I have<br/>
B&amp;W copies so I could just have them custom made and replace the<br/>
boxes if I want.<br/>

&gt;First, thanks for positive public and private comments.  I never<br/>
&gt;really wanted anything for setting up the domain other than to be<br/>
&gt;spared negative comments.  I was quite taken aback.  I could write<br/>
&gt;quite a bit on ethnic characterizations and terms, but will not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;About the stamp carving kit, people did not see the message because <br/>
&gt;it was a private matter relating to letterboxing.org, and it was wrong <br/>
&gt;of me to bring it up in public.  I was frustrated.  Basically, people<br/>
&gt;asked to pay part of my costs ($120), and I said send me a stamp carving<br/>
&gt;starter kit instead, which I assumed would cost much less, but provide<br/>
&gt;more value, sort of an I'll give you my expertese, and you give me yours<br/>
&gt;sort of thing.  I never heard back and drew the wrong conclusion.  Thanks<br/>
&gt;for all the offers of a kit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I've been to Dartmoor, and I agree with Mitch that this is not Dartmoor,<br/>
&gt;and happen to also agree that the internet is an ideal (but not exclusive)<br/>
&gt;medium for development of the hobby outside of Dartmoor.  If people <br/>
&gt;from Dartmoor (or elsewhere) resent the hobby being developed outside that<br/>
&gt;area, I don't know what to say, other than I've never met a Swede who <br/>
&gt;resented recreational orienteering being developed outside of Sweden, or <br/>
&gt;an American resenting baseball being played in Asia or Central America.  <br/>
&gt;The Swedes still dominate orienteering, and America still dominates <br/>
&gt;baseball, and I'm sure Dartmoor shall always retain its cache and mistique<br/>
&gt;in the letterboxing world.  I really don't care which group or place <br/>
&gt;dominates any of these pastimes; it costs nothing to share an idea with<br/>
&gt;another person or culture, and usually both sides are inriched.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for uses of the letterboxing.org server, I truly do not care.  I am<br/>
&gt;not pushing to have the mailing list moved there, or pushing any other <br/>
&gt;uses.  As I said, I would prefer not to use the egroups list because <br/>
&gt;I do not like slow graphics and other advertising attached to my e-mail. <br/>
&gt;There is no other motivation, and if people are content with the egroups<br/>
&gt;list, fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hopefully this whole matter will not provide further diversion :-)<br/>
