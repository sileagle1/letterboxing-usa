                    <div class="plaintext-content">So you all had me go and do it! In hopes of drawing more people for <br/>
my White Sands clean-up, I went and Changed this box from a mystery <br/>
box to a regular. I have only a handful of people helping clean this <br/>
once beautiful location and I would love to have a few more. So if <br/>
anyone could lend a few hours of there time and help New Hampshire <br/>
stay beautiful, I would appreciate it a whole big bunch as I hope <br/>
others will in the community.<br/>
The Conservation Commision of Pembroke, knows about my effort <br/>
scheduled for May 7th, and are aware that I letterbox with best <br/>
intentions for the area. They know that many may come to the clean-<br/>
up as letterboxers, but many may come as concerned town residents. <br/>
Only the Conservation Commision knows that there is a letterbox <br/>
located in this location.<br/>
I plan on being down at White Sands at 10am and I don't plan on <br/>
leaving until the area is clean. I will have a special stamp for <br/>
this event for those that do make it and I'm working on having pizza <br/>
as well. Please consider leaning a hand for such a wonderful cause.<br/>
