suprised to see that I was the first person to have found it, even <br/>
though it has been there since last November.  This is a really <br/>
beautiful area with a nice reflection of Mt. Hood in the lake.  You <br/>
all are missing out on not only a nice hike, but a really cool stamp <br/>
as well!  Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I had to limit my <br/>
hike to the lake and couldn't continue on to Tom, Dick, and Harry <br/>
Mountain.  However, sometime in the near future I'll head back up <br/>
there to complete the hike.  And when I do so, I better see some more <br/>
people stamped in!  :)  <br/>

Watch out for mosquito's; they were unusually bad for me.<br/>
