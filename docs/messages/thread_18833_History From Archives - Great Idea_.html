&gt; sheer size of the archives, and the impossibility <br/>
&gt; of searching out information there. Having read<br/>
&gt; many of the posts over the last year or so, I <br/>
&gt; have decided to create a series of narratives<br/>
&gt; which provide a sampler of interesting, relevant,<br/>
&gt; and/or historical posts to the archive. My intent<br/>
&gt; is to document some of the "firsts" of <br/>
&gt; letterboxing in the US, as well as to provide<br/>
&gt; some of the flavor of letterboxing as it<br/>
&gt; was then - compared to how it is now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Episode one may be found at<br/>

What a great idea! I never took the time to look at many<br/>
of the early posts, so I'm thankful for you doing it for me. <br/>
It is very interesting and enlightening to "relive" the early <br/>
days of letterboxing here in USA.  I now have an even greater <br/>
respect for our "Foreboxers".<br/>
Looking forward to future installments.<br/>
