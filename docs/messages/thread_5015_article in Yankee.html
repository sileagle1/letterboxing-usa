<div>Here's my letterboxing story 
to share.</div>
<div>Being a hot 92 degrees today in CT, I set out with my kids to 
a letterbox close by where we live that we had visited over a year ago.  
When we were there before, we had discovered a little swimming hole. So I had 
the kids wear their swimming suits, grabbed the letterboxing backpack, threw in 
the May issue of Yankee Magazine which had just arrived, and off we went.  
When we got there, the kids hit the water and I went to check on the letterbox. 
It was a bit damp, so after I read all the entries, I left it to dry in the sun 
a little and grabbed my Yankee Magazine and set back to relax. Now this just 
happens to be a Drew Clan letterbox, so I was ironically and pleasantly 
surprised to turn to page 22 of Yankee and see Jay Drew's picture (whom I have 
yet to meet) and a one page article on letterboxing in the "Yarns, Snippets 
&amp; Whatnots" section of this New England magazine.  Its a very 
nice, precise article with an emphasis on all of Jay's work and contributions to 
the letterboxing hobby, especially here in CT.  Well done Jay and 
congratulations for the article.  It made my day.  </div>
