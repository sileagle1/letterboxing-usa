again I have started writing more of my Great Adventures.  I didn't <br/>
post about them here since it didn't have to do with the Appalachian <br/>
Trail or letterboxing in any way, but for those of you who want to <br/>
read it, you can find the last counple of adventures at <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/adventures/<br/>
<br/>
Also, thanks so much to you folks who have submitted pledges for the <br/>
Hike-A-Thon I'm participating in!  There aren't as many pledges as I <br/>
hoped for, but the generosity of those who have pledged are far <br/>
beyond what I ever expected!  Thank you all so much!<br/>
<br/>
For those that *haven't* pledge, get a move on!  ;o)  You still have <br/>
until the end of the month.  Even if it's only five or ten bucks, <br/>
every little bit helps!<br/>
<br/>
Also, one anonymous person has pledged $1.00 per mile I hiked.  I <br/>
figured that had to by a typo and verified it with the person and, <br/>
no, it wasn't a typo.  (I'm planning to hike between $100 and $150 <br/>
miles, so a buck per mile adds up to quite a bit!)<br/>
<br/>
Not only was it not a typo, but this person challenged me to find <br/>
somebody that would beat this pledge, and if I did, they would match <br/>
or beat the higher pledge!  Anybody out there that wants to make them <br/>
regret making such a challenge?  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
For more information about the Hike-A-Thon and to submit a pledge <br/>
yourself, visit the webpage at http://www.atlasquest.com/hikeathon/<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all of you who have made pledges, and especially to <br/>
the person with the $1 per-mile pledge!<br/>
