                    <div class="plaintext-content">Run, don't walk, to the "Chipmunk on the Run" and "Hide and Seek <br/>
Kitty" letterboxes hidden by Betsey Sennott on trails at the Notch on <br/>
the Holyoke Range, in Amherst, Mass.  The clues are here:<br/>

<br/>
The Holyoke Range Notch is now a topnotch (sorry, couldn't resist) <br/>
letterboxing destination, because the Drew Clan has already hidden two <br/>
boxes on other trails there.  If you start early and come prepared for <br/>
a few hours of hiking, you can easily pick up four stamps in one day. <br/>
To make it easy for folks to find clues for all four boxes, I added a <br/>
link to the LBNA Western Mass. clues page.<br/>
<br/>
Betsey's two new boxes involve a small amount of climbing but are not <br/>
too difficult for small children.  I've done the two Drew Clan boxes <br/>
as well; they involve more strenuous climbing and could be done with <br/>
kids, too, but might be better for older children who are experienced <br/>
hikers.<br/>
<br/>
Look out Connecticut!<br/>
<br/>
Other Mass. news: The Mass. mystery "Solitude" box is in good shape.  <br/>
I found it last week only a few days after Tom Cooch had been there.  <br/>
It was great to see your stamp again, Tom! Also, the Soaring Willows <br/>
box in Seekonk, Mass., though it hasn't received a lot of visitors, is <br/>
also still in place and in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
If I may make yet another plug for my sister Betsey's boxes, last week <br/>
I found the Heron on the Charles box and thoroughly enjoyed both the <br/>
walk and the stamp.  I saw two cormorants, a red-tailed hawk, and a <br/>
real blue heron in addition to the letterbox heron! <br/>
<br/>
That's it for now--but beware, I'm on vacation this week and plan to <br/>
get a new box or two of my own planted soon!<br/>
