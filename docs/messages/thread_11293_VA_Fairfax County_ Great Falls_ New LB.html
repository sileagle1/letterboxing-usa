This letterbox was planted 3/19/03 in Riverbend Park.<br/>
Difficulty: A modest hike.<br/>
You will need a compass, and you need to differentiate between <br/>
a pace and a step.<br/>
Follow the directions to Riverbend Park Visitors Center and park <br/>
in the lower (boat-launch) lot. Take the trail that leaves from the <br/>
NW corner of the parking lot. After 6 or 7 minutes you will come to <br/>
a fork; take the trail that bears 230 degrees. At the next <br/>
intersection (with a blue-blazed trail), proceed on a bearing of <br/>
291 degrees. At the Upland Trail sign, bear 209 degrees. When <br/>
you come to a footbridge, cross it and you will come to a "T". On <br/>
a bearing of 160 degrees go 13 paces to a downed tree on the <br/>
right. Follow this tree to its roots. Now find another downed tree <br/>
nearby that leads up at 250 degrees. Follow it to its roots and <br/>
you will find SpryngFlyng.<br/>
