World. The list is intended for sharing of ideas, stories, tips, news, <br/>
advice, and clues related to the hobby of letterboxing."<br/>
<br/>
It is not for venting.<br/>
<br/>
FYI there are a few times when the topics on this list get screwed up <br/>
and stray away from letterboxing. Some of those times happen due to <br/>
ignorance and some other times occur when a  troll cruises into the <br/>
chatlist and trys to stir things up. Usually when there is several off <br/>
topic posts by the same person then it 'could be' the latter example I <br/>
cited. Most folks seem to be able to express their thoughts in one or <br/>
two posts, while those that post repeatedly and try to stir things up <br/>
could be a 'gamer'. We have had our share of 'gamers', and for those <br/>
that do not understand what a 'gamer' is here is a short description. <br/>
A gamer establishes a false personsa, posts to a chatlist and trys to <br/>
create a dialog very quickly. If they are lucky enough to establish <br/>
themselves they gain points similarly to the way we record finds. They <br/>
try to work sympathy, create heated discussions and start flames. The <br/>
more they stir up the chatlist the better they like it. Now I'm not <br/>
pointing any fingers, but the easiest way to discourage a gamer is not <br/>
to play.<br/>
