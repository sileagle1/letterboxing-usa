Find this letterbox and you'll be rewarded with a rare view of the <br/>
Hollywood Sign from the back.<br/>
<br/>
Find Franklin Ave, just north and parallel to Hollywood Blvd. A few <br/>
blocks east of Vine is a small street called Beachwood. Take this <br/>
north for a ways, through several stop signs, until you come to <br/>
Ledgewood, and go left. Follow Ledgewood uphill until you come to a <br/>
five-way intersection. Go straight ahead and slightly to the right, <br/>
merging with Deronda. Follow Deronda as it winds past luxurious <br/>
houses, all the way to the end where there is a white wall and gate <br/>
on the left. Park and go to the left of the gate where you will see a <br/>
small pedestrian gate, letting you into the service road. Don't worry <br/>
about the restricted entry signs; these are referring to cars. Follow <br/>
this concrete service road to the top of Mt Lee, where you will see <br/>
spectacular views of Burbank and the San Fernando Valley on your <br/>
right. As you near the top and the road curves sharply to the right, <br/>
you will see a green chainlink fence ahead. Starting at the right end <br/>
of the fence, count 10 fencepoles to the left. Stand with your back <br/>
to the tenth pole, and walk straight ahead into a sandstone cliff <br/>
face. About seven feet up from the ground is a small hole, with the <br/>
letterbox buried in sand. After, continue a short ways up the road to <br/>
see the enormous Hollywood Sign letters from the back, with the <br/>
Hollywood Reservoir and Hills spread below you.<br/>
