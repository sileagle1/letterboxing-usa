to be for Pete and me! It's been getting harder and harder to talk <br/>
Pete into traveling anywhere for letterboxing lately. He almost <br/>
always prefers long local hikes to long drives with barely time left <br/>
for a few drive-bys! However, last Saturday morning he agreed to make <br/>
the 5-hour drive down to the Tyler "T" Gathering in Newtown, PA, and <br/>
we're both so very glad we went!<br/>
<br/>
First of all, the gathering itself was a blast, not only of cold air <br/>
and battling bands pulling us in different directions (really just in <br/>
our heads!), but also of good cheer and laughter, as Hikers&amp;Hounds <br/>
warmed us up with hot cocoa and grilled cheese sandwiches cooked on a <br/>
camp stove, Mack sent us scurrying for "who done it" fingerprint <br/>
clues, and Lightnin' Bug and friends regaled us with rich humor, <br/>
Pokemon fun, and new musical clues till the sun went down!<br/>
<br/>
Even when darkness fell, though, we were still not quite ready to <br/>
quit letterboxing, so off we dashed to the "Songs of the Season" in <br/>
nearby Chalfont. What great timing that turned out to be! Holiday <br/>
evening events were just beginning as we finished our outdoor search <br/>
amidst the lit trees and sculptures, so inside we went to sip wassail <br/>
surrounded by Byers Choice "Christmas Carolers", live Dickensian <br/>
carolers, and an interesting display of creches from all around the <br/>
world! We were so delighted that once again letterboxing had led us <br/>
to such an unexpected treat!<br/>
<br/>
The next morning looked like a vision from Narnia! We climbed the <br/>
snow-encrusted hills in search of long-lost mapsurferian treasure, <br/>
but ended up planting an addition to one of our own little boxes <br/>
instead. Afterwards, we found ourselves "Walkin' the Dog" in <br/>
Mizscarlet's backyard, and then headed down to Delaware for a nice <br/>
warm meal and stay after such a cold day!<br/>
<br/>
It had been several years since we last boxed in Delaware so we were <br/>
quite amazed to see how many new boxes were now available. We decided <br/>
to concentrate on the longer hikes, from the Mason-Dixon Trail in <br/>
White Clay Creek, to Hexcat's "green pastures" before they turned <br/>
white with the next approaching snowstorm. Our favorite of all was <br/>
getting "Into the Woods" on Sheba's fairy tale of a loop trail. And, <br/>
to "Sum It Up", we actually ended up "quadrupling" our former <br/>
Delaware count, giving us plenty of new memories to enjoy thinking <br/>
about on the long drive home!<br/>
<br/>
So, it was a blustery but wonderful wintry weekend, now continued <br/>
with several more days of chilly letterboxing back here in frozen New <br/>
England. We just want to say thanks again to all who have helped make <br/>
letterboxing such a "great outdoor open party", even in the snow!<br/>
Cheers and Happy Holidays!!!<br/>

weekend, conditions permitting, to get us "tuned up" for Syracuse!)<br/>
