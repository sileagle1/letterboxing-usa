week?  I work in a store right near where it was<br/>
taking place.<br/>
<br/>
The Planet series starts at the University Of Maine<br/>
Presque Isle campus Science building and goes south on<br/>
US Rt 1 all the way to Houlton.  I live just down the<br/>
road from Jupiter so I see it and all the inner<br/>
planets every time I go to town.  If you ever want<br/>
come up for a day and do the series I'd be willing to<br/>
join you.  We can also pick up an 8-box series in a<br/>
park in Presque Isle.  Good weather is<br/>
coming....sometime....LOL<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">i heard the pow wow wasn't going to be very good, so i passed. can't <br/>
take the indoor ones for very long. usually (at least the ones i've <br/>
been to in maine) the area isn't very big, the sound system cranked <br/>
up too much. i love the drums, but not when i have to scream at the <br/>
top of lungs for someone right next to me, to hear me.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for offer to do the series. have to consider that.<br/>
if you're not busy 4th julu weekend (fri, sat, sun) we have a pow <br/>
wow in ft. kent. city park, near the basketball courts, near rite <br/>
aide. admission is free. bring your own chair, cooler (sorry, no <br/>
beer, etc). this a nice family event. don't have to be native to <br/>
come. i'll be the big white booth with the solar panel on the front.<br/>
