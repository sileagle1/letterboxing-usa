                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
  Just back from a great vacation out west! We found the following <br/>
boxes:<br/>
Idaho:<br/>
  Idaho Falls Series - all 4 good - hubby loved the clear, precise <br/>
directions! Stamps great.<br/>
<br/>
Montana:<br/>
  Rattlesnake National Recreation Area series (missoula): Sought and <br/>
found #1 and #2. #3 seemed to have an incorrect marker number; that <br/>
and incoming thunder storm led us to give up. Pretty area to walk!<br/>
<br/>
  Kalispell (Lone Letterbox): We were first to find this box in Lone <br/>
Pine State Park. Also picked up a hitchhiker which wasn't named, so I <br/>
will call it the Kallispell Hitchhiker. Great park. Go to the visitor <br/>
center -- not only did the ranger(?) help us find the landmark in the <br/>
clues, but they have a great display on wild fire fighting and <br/>
wildlife. Kids (and adults) can touch!<br/>
<br/>
Wyoming:<br/>
     Elk, Jackson Hole: Found, good shape and several visitors have <br/>
found it. Do watch your head when retrieving and replacing the box. <br/>
Ouch! Cute stamp!<br/>
     Jackson's Elk: Found, good shape. Has had some visitors though <br/>
only recently placed. Nice, large stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for placing these. The wildfires in Glacier Park caused <br/>
us to change the second week of our vacation last minute. These boxes <br/>
were a fun addition to our re-routed trip!<br/>
