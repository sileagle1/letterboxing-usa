Hi,<br/>
Okay, obviously I'm new at this. I just now figured<br/>
out how the postings work. I was under the impression<br/>
what I was emailing went to one person who would<br/>
answer my questions. Now I see my postings in the<br/>
archive. So, with that said, I'm resending my previous<br/>
three boxes for people who can't get attachments and<br/>
in the future I won't send them. Thanks for telling me<br/>
Lucy, mountainscorpia.hotmail, I wasn't sure. So, here<br/>
are the last three I posted. I've upgraded the<br/>
difficulty level, as far as the walk is concerned for<br/>
the Paugusset Falls boxes. You'll love it there<br/>
Drewclan! <br/>

Your name: John at liberumarbitrium@yahoo.com<br/>
The name of the letterbox: CT-The Fairy Pool<br/>
The date you placed it: 03-30-02<br/>
What state and county it is located in: Hartford, CT.<br/>
The name of the nearest town: Glastonbury<br/>
Difficulty: Not long trip (1000yards) but rocky,<br/>
slippery, wet conditions. Should take about 15-20<br/>
minutes one way.<br/>
<br/>
Hi,<br/>
I placed a box in the Meshomasic State Forest in<br/>
Glastonbury. Please wear footwear that will help you<br/>
negotiate wet, slippery rocks, and stream crossings.<br/>
Glastonbury does have rattlesnakes, so use caution.<br/>
