there.  =)  <br/>

For whoever hunts for the Pacific Spirit letterbox, we found it in <br/>

the one zip-lock bag protecting the contents torn open.  <br/>
(Surprisingly, the logbook was in remarkably good condition, <br/>
though!)  We didn't have any zip-locks to replace it, so if you <br/>
happen to be in the area hunting for the box, be sure to bring a <br/>
freezer-size zip-lock bag.  (We had a small one, but the logbook <br/>
wouldn't fit in it.)<br/>

We were also the first to find the Derby Reach series with wonderful <br/>

Amanda sent me on a wild goose chase after a Stanley Park box, but if <br/>
there ever was a box (it's not on the website!), it's missing now.  <br/>
But somebody needs to hide a nice, big series in that park.  With <br/>
stamps of the Lion's Gate Brige, woman in a wetsuit, totem poles, <br/>
miniture railway, racoons (and DON'T feed these things! *rolling <br/>
eyes*) and plenty of other great stamps!  I would, but I'll be <br/>
spending my summer in Central America!  =)  So somebody else needs to <br/>
do it for me to find later.  Yep.  Definitely needs to be done.  =)<br/>

<div>Well, you get a big OOPS from me! I planted the Stanley Park 
box, entitled "We Took the Train" and I thought I posted it to the listserv in 
addition to adding it to my web page, but....I forgot to get it on my web site. 
Did you actually go hunting for that box? </div>

Yes.  Found the exact tree it was supposed to be in, but nothing was <br/>
there.  But that's been known to happen to letterboxes.  *shrug*  No <br/>
big deal.  =)<br/>
