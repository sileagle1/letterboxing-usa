<div>While on an Elderhostel 6 women from the 
U.S.A.(Minn.-Linda and Roxie, Va.--</div>
<div>Fran and Linda, and Ca.- Patti and 
Gwen) had tea at the Empress Hotel, 
fulfilling a dream!  There was time for learning, laughing and lounging, 
also just enough time to plant 2 boxes, though they are now orphans.  Does 
one of our Canadian neighbors want to adopt them? <span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> </div>

<div>OAK BAY, VICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIA ON VANCOUVER ISLAND.  (Scenic, 
easy location)</div>
<div>The Marina at Oak Bay is watched by a life sized 
Orca and is located near the intersection of Beach Dr. and Orchard.  From 
those streets look for a blue sign for Turkey Head Walkway.  Just past 
Frank W. Knight's bench on your left walk to the second Turkey Head Walkway 
sign.  Place yourself at the sharp edge of the sign facing the small 
inlet and the rocky embankment.  At  9 paces (dainty lady paces) and 
90 degrees from the edge of the sign, walk across the sidewalk to the second 
large rock along the upper part of the embankment.   Climb down to the waterside of the rock. The box is in 
a nook protected by smaller rocks.  Be discrete; this is a popular 
walk.  We had time to place this box while on a city tour of 
Victoria.    Two Chicks on the Loose, aka Patti and Gwen</div>

<div>BEAR AND BERRY BOX ON GALLOPING GOOSE BIKE PATH </div>
<div>VICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIA (easy, but watch out for 
berry bushes) </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Gorge is a beautiful waterway and the Trestle Bridge over the Gorge 
</div>
<div> is well used by bikers and walkers. (If driving, park near 
Jutland on Gorge Road and wander down to the Bike path.)   Heading 
north from the Trestle bridge walk under Gorge Road bridge and check out 
the mural called "Bridging".  Very soon you will come to "Tom Arkell 
Trail".  Continue on bike path to wooden bench or take the little gravel 
path along creek to the bench. Facing the bench and to your left  take 
the stone steps leading down to creek and then pass a rocky outcropping on your 
left.  Head north along creek on the gravel path.  Shortly you will 
see a wooden foot bridge across the creek and in the distance you will see 2 
grated water outlets.  Stop at the foot bridge.  Starting at the 
west side of the tree near the foot bridge walk 7 paces at 330 degrees.  
Turn to 250 degrees (away from creek), take 10 (dainty) paces toward rocky 
hollow among ivy and thorny bushes (gloves would be nice) .  On the left 
side of the hollow behind a little pile of  rocks lies the bear waiting for the berries.     Placed by
