                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I was in Long Beach over the weekend for business  (02/16/03), <br/>
I convinced a couple of my co-workers to go letterboxing with me. I <br/>
think we now have two more enthusiasts!<br/>
<br/>
We did not have time to search for all the boxes but found 3 of the 5 <br/>
we looked for and one bonus box. <br/>
<br/>
#1 Nature Center - could not find this one at all. We were at marker <br/>
15 and the waterfountain but no matter how we paced off and checked <br/>
directions, found nothing. There were not two logs that looked right <br/>
but we looked under and around everything in the vicinity. <br/>
<br/>
#2 El Dorado Express - alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
#3 Elvis of El Dorado - the King lives! I see that someone else <br/>
recently reported it missing but we found it after he reported it <br/>
missing. Also found the bonus box that it sent us to.<br/>
<br/>
#4 El Dorado Lady - no question that we were in the right tree but <br/>
the Lady doesn't live there anymore. We hoisted up four people and <br/>
searched the cavity thoroughly (great spot) but no box.<br/>
<br/>
#5 - ran out of time/daylight<br/>
<br/>
#6 Billie Boswell Bike Path - thank you for giving two sets of clues <br/>
to this one, we needed both but were successful in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Don &amp; Gwen for a great day!  One note - we started the day <br/>
out looking for the Signal Hill letterbox. As we did not know the <br/>
area, we had purchased a map of Long Beach. Unfortunately, this map <br/>
made no mention of Hill Top Park so we spent easily an hour searching <br/>
all through Signal Hill Park for something that matched any of the <br/>
clues. We had even figured out what the black arrow heads were but <br/>
couldn't find any. We stubbornly continued driving up Hill Street <br/>
after we finally gave up and happened to see some of the arrowheads <br/>
going up another road. We were happily surprised to find the Hill Top <br/>
Park and easily found the letterbox once we got there!<br/>

<div>Drat!  I wonder what I am doing 
wrong?  I'll have to go back and check again.  It may be in the spot 
where I keep seeing people fishing. I'll have to go back and see if I can find 
it.  Hopefully the fishermen aren't there this time.</div>
