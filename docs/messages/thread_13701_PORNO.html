I'm sorry, I wasn't clear.  I didn't find your post inflammatory, <br/>

<br/>
I agree with the fact that the moderators should have been contacted directly in a nice way. Reading all these rude posts (in conjunction with the posts about geocachers) has made me reconsider staying on this list. Which is too bad because I think the majority of the people here are super! <br/>
<br/>
How's the saying go? A couple bad apples ruin the bunch? <br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is if you don't like the posts on the list you can <br/>
a.  nicely contact the moderators<br/>
b.  opt to cancel out of the list or <br/>
c.  volunteer to be a moderator! <br/>
<br/>
But I don't believe you should send such inflammatory comments about it!<br/>
