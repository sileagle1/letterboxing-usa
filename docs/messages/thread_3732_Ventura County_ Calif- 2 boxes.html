<div>Nearest city:  
Ventura/Oxnard,Calif.,  placed 11/13/01 
by Don &amp; Gwen: "The JackHoy Orca"  and "If Pigs Could Fly.".  Semi orphaned boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To start your quest you need to obtain a copy of 
the book, "Diary of a Sea Captain's Wife by Margaret Holden Eaton.  Try for 
a copy at your library or you can get a copy from McNally &amp; Loftin, 
publishers, P. O. Box 1316 Santa Barbara, Ca  93101.  The location of 
both boxes is noted on the front and back covers as well as photographic plates 
# 27, 28, 29 and 32.  The location is also discussed at length in chapters 
VII and VIII.  </div>
<div>There are several ways to arrive at the box 
sites:  Private boat, commercial boat and then your sea kayak from other 
locations nearby.  Hopefully you will be able to spend an idyllic weekend 
or longer.  Both boxes require a landing that can be somewhat tricky.  
Wait for the calm in the surge to make a safe landing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1.  JackHoy Orca   From the landing 
walk up and then to your left out toward the point as shown in photo plate # 
27.   Walk between the eucalyptus and big pine that marks the entrance 
to the point.  70 paces along the trail you will find an 18" concrete 
pyramid.  From the pyramid walk 20 paces at 70 degrees, then 4 paces at 170 
degrees.  Look at the base of the gnarly multi limbed bush 
(manzanita?).  The box is hidden under some movable rocks.  If the box 
can't be located find the 6 foot high wooden sign post near the tip of the 
point.  From the sign post walk 48 paces at 170 degrees to the gnarly 
limbed bush.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.  "If Pigs Could Fly"  From the area at 
the top of the landing take the path to your right uphill past the eucalyptus 
tree 40 paces to a concrete block.  Then 90 paces uphill to a large 
solitary orange boulder.  From the boulder look for the  "Quest" at 
320 degrees.  The letterbox is under some debris in a hole under "Muchacha" 
and </div>
<div>behind C  heart A.  Enjoy the seafaring 
history inscribed at this location.  Why is the box here you ask?  
This box site may become the last home for a pig at this spot due to the NPS 
eradication of the feral pig population.  Hopefully the NPS won't find this 
pig as he had to fly to get to this spot.</div>
