John,<br/>
	From 3:30 on you are likely to run into heavy traffic on the GW Bridge and<br/>
the Cross Bronx Expressway --  just other names for 95.<br/>
<br/>
	Options:<br/>
		1.  Cross the GW Bridge and exit immediately upon crossing onto Henry<br/>
Hudson Parkway, northbound.  Look for Cross County and then northbound on<br/>
Merritt Parkway into Connecticut or instead of the Merritt take 287<br/>
eastbound to eastbound 95 into Connecticut.  This is not as difficult nor as<br/>
long as it sounds.  But a map would be helpful.<br/>
		2.  Before crossing GW Bridge, stay in Local lanes of 95.  Look for exit<br/>
to northbound Palisade Parkway. Continue on Parkway until eastbound 87 (New<br/>
York Thruway).  Cross the Hudson River on the Tappan Zee Bridge, continue on<br/>
287 (not 87 into New York City).  Exit on Merritt or 95 into Connecticut.<br/>
		3.  Tell your friends it just isn't worth visiting Connecticut from the<br/>
South!<br/>
<br/>
	Have fun at the rendezvous.<br/>

<br/>
Awright, folks.  I need your help.<br/>
<br/>
How do you recommend I get around NYC on friday night?  I'm coming from<br/>
Philly and heading to CT.  I guess I'll be coming up the NJ Turnpike (I-95).<br/>
Does it make sense to just stay on I-95 thru NYC, or is there a better<br/>
alternative?<br/>
<br/>
I'd really appreciate your input.<br/>
<br/>
John<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ooooo, a navigation question to a bunch of letterboxers! John, you're <br/>
a brave man! IMHO it's always fastest to listen to the am radio <br/>
("traffic on the eights") as you come up the NJTP, and take 95 North <br/>
unless the radio is really serious about avoiding it. We've tried the <br/>
Tappan Zee Bridge/Merritt Expressway bypass many times and it's <br/>
always been worse. You could do the Verazzano Bridge and 287 (???) to <br/>
connect to 95 after the Cross Bronx Exwy, but the trip through <br/>
Brooklyn is also a mess. Every time we've tried to go around the <br/>
city, all those folks mucking up 95 were heading to the same suburbs <br/>
that the bypasses go through, so the trip has been longer with just <br/>
as much stop-and-go. Granted, I'm predjudiced, since I'm from <br/>
California, where I95 would have at least 8 lanes and still be a <br/>
parking lot. We left NYC this past Sunday night along with 100,000 <br/>
other cyclists and baseball fans and had maybe 15 minutes of slowdown <br/>
by staying with the direct route along I95.<br/>

Cluesheet to follow!<br/>
