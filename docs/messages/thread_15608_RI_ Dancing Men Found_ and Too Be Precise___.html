&gt; <br/>
&gt; From there we went elsewhere and did Too Be Precise...  A favorite <br/>
&gt; hike of Steve's; Heidi did not appreciate the rocky terrain and it <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; indeed hazardous.  Had a nice chat with the ranger/warden/care <br/>
taker <br/>
&gt; there and found out someone is in that place watching people 8-10 <br/>
&gt; hours a day! So be careful and discreet!!!! What an AWESOME view of <br/>
&gt; RI's Long and Ell ponds too. Those rocks deserve a "holy cow" too! <br/>
&gt; They dwarf any other we've seen  : )<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also had a nice time celebrating Jay Drews birthday <hint hint=""> <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; Patrick, Amy, and Butterfly this morning!!!<br/>
