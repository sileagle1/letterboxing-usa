Does anyone know a "Phineas Boch" ?<br/>
<br/>
I've received the following telegram by mistake and I'm trying to <br/>
forward to him:<br/>
<br/>

Master Boch<br/>
The spirits have shown me your future, and in it I have seen a <br/>
beautiful Gypsy woman entering your life very soon. It is I, <br/>
Natascha! I, Madam Natascha, famed oracle, trusted confidant to the <br/>
Spirit World, will soon be joining your entourage. I am enroute to <br/>
you now from my native Romania (or was it Czechoslovakia?).<br/>
<br/>
In any event, I should be arriving in a very few days. I apologize <br/>
for such short notice, but I trust you will accommodate. I had to <br/>
hasten my arrangements. It seems the local authorities suspect I <br/>
played a role in the recent death of my husband. It is true that I <br/>
predicted his demise; a ghastly poisoning, but I only relay what the <br/>
spirits show me. Mad? I curse the fools! <br/>
<br/>
I miss dear sweet Alfredo. He was my seventh husband. Yes some<br/>
well... perhaps all of my husbands passed under mysterious <br/>
circumstances but why do they always assume it was by my hand? I am <br/>
being driven from my native land because they fear I will stake my <br/>
royal claim! My Mother, Madam Zelda was also a great oracle.  The <br/>
fools confused her great talent for madness as well! She was a wise <br/>
and powerful Gypsy who traveled all the World, providing guidance to <br/>
the royal houses of Europe. She would not reveal the identity of my <br/>
Father to me, that secret was buried with her, but she told me once <br/>
that he was a son of the Czar himself. And this is why the <br/>
aristocracy unfairly accuses me now, persecute me! To keep me <br/>
silent! <br/>
<br/>
Until we meet<br/>
Madam Natascha<br/>
<br/>
