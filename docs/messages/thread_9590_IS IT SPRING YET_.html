                    <div class="plaintext-content">WE liked snow before we started letterboxing,now we got our faces pushed up to the window waiting to see some nice green grass.Frankly the snow is just getting to be knee deep and our frogs hate the snow.Been carving alot,working on a big project for you all to do if you want but it don't look like i'll be getting it out until the snow clears.For now it would be nice to do or put out some easy drive up's.We can't wait to go back and finish doing Mansfield,so far we picked up 65 boxes in that town alone.Well hope to get going soon,already got the winter blues and it has not even started yet i'm just sitting around the house getting fat,but the way i look at it is i'll have all summer to walk it off.Lenny/Kathy the NeeDeeps  <br/>

                    <html><body>Oh do I sympathize!  I too wish to see green grass!  Yesterday I went into the state forest to plant boxes and it was three times harder with the snow!  I'll most likely have to move a few because they may be too vulnerable once the snow clears.  I just happen to have white topped boxes which blend in perfectly this time of year.  
<br/>
<br/>I do say that snow makes it that more of a challenge!  While up at My Favorite Musicals, I only found 17 out of 21 due to the snow.  It is hard to find a box under a flat rock in eight inches of snow!  I would have had to dig up the whole area, which would have definitely been obvious for the casual hiker, and for those who don't like our presence.  
<br/>
<br/>If you REALLY want to go out boxing... go to the shore.  I was down in Charlestown RI last weekend and found not an inch of snow!  (My parents didn't go down this weekend, so I don't have the latest snow report!).  Many times they don't get snow when I get snow, and they barely use a shovel there.  Maybe Wanda and Pete can give us a snow report for RI????  That way, maybe some of us can get our fix!

                    <html><body>In addition, I am starting a plan for when the snow does melt!  Since I have only found 187 in six months, I need to step up the letterboxing.  I've decided that I'm going to go letterboxing during the week in the winter, if possible, and then start going to the western part of the state and finding those.  THen work east.  On days where it would be impossible to go all of the way out there, I'm going to the letterboxing mecca of Mansfield.  I think I've only found approx. 40 there, and I want to find every single one!  Also, while visiting the parental units in Charlestown, I'm going to start plugging away at Wanda and Pete's boxes.  Now that I don't go out boxin' with Darrin, it should take me less time, since I get out of bed earlier in the morning!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">although the snow is melting a bit, we got 7 inches of snow on <br/>
Thursday on the RI coast.  I went out yesterday in North Kingstown <br/>
and had a tough time.  I think I found the right lichen covered rock <br/>
under the snow but when I took a bearing off the rock and walked 15 <br/>
paces I ended up in endless snow with no place for a letterbox to <br/>
hide in sight.  I found the next box safely tucked in its dry spot.  <br/>
I put my journal on top of a snow covered rock to stamp in not <br/>
realizing that the soft snow won't support the weight of stamping in <br/>
very well (duh!)  <br/>
<br/>
I have 7 letterboxes ready to plant but am going to wait until the <br/>
snow is gone (maybe July?)<br/>
<br/>
oh well, this is New England !<br/>
