                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>After discovering that this box was still in the field from someone onlist, I went out to look for it, even though I didn't have the clues. Didn't take too long to find it anyway.
<br/>
<br/>The box is in terrible shape. The logbook is ruined, and so is the stamp pad. The container looks like an old take-out container, and was chewed through by something. The box was on the downhill side of a tree, hidden in the roots, but it got completely soaked through. 
<br/>
<br/>I'm going to get a new box and logbook for it, and put it back in the field next week.
<br/>
<br/>Mike S.
