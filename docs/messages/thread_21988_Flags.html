it during an average week, you'd think I could keep up with things.  <br/>

It makes sense to me now.  I had replied to Steve but have since<br/>
deleted the reply that I just didn't know why I wasn't seeing it.<br/>

NOW I SEE.  ;-)   duh.<br/>

  The flags that appear on the list of clue names means the clue isn't <br/>
  hosted on LbNA.  If there isn't a flag then click on the clue and it <br/>
  should have the flag in the top right hand corner with a list of <br/>
  finders, if any.  From the members page you can set it so that it <br/>
  hides your boxes the ones you found and attemped/missing boxes.  With <br/>
