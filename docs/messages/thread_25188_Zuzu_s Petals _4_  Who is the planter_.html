My daughter and I where letterboxing today in Waukesha,WI at Minooka Park<br/>
and found Zuzu's Petals #4 letterbox by accident. It was in a very small<br/>
container with no logbook. There are no clues for the box on Atlas Quest or<br/>
LBNA. Does anybody out there no anything about this lettebox? It was across<br/>
the road from Picnic Area 3 on the red trail, just a short distance from the<br/>
trailhead. Not far off the trail on the left side, hidden in a downed tree.<br/>
