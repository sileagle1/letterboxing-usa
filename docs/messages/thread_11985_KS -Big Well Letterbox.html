Attempted to find the Big Well letterbox in Greensburg, KS today.  <br/>
Sadly, it appears to be missing.  The lady in the gift shop said she <br/>
had had one other inquiry but didn't know anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
We did get to see lots of beautiful prairie and a cool antiques shop, <br/>
so it was still worth the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Do we get to count this as found since the box was missing and we have <br/>
no stamp?<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to check on missing status before making a trip to the <br/>
letterbox... i.e. is this information kept updated on the LBNA website?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Kendra<br/>
