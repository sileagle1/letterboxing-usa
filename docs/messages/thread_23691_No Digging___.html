I often find myself struggling to reconcile the concept of Leave No Trace<br/>
with letterboxing. Clearly, it is not a leave no trace activity. Yet, the<br/>
actions we take when hiking, planting, and hunting can go a long way towards<br/>
<br/>
being good stewards: choosing our hiding locations with attention to<br/>
surrounding vegetation, picking up trash while we walk, not taking a direct<br/>
route to an off-trail box (creates social trails), considering what damage<br/>
someone looking for your box can do and factoring that in to your placement<br/>
and clues, etc, etc, etc.<br/>
<br/>
**********************<br/>
<br/>
I teach LNT to scouts and I've also introduced several of them to LB'ing.<br/>
I've also struggled with reconciling the two concepts.<br/>
<br/>
All those things you mention help to make that reconciliation easier.  I was<br/>
finally able to put my own mind to rest when I realized that I may be taking<br/>
something and leaving it in the woods, but I'm also committing to caring for<br/>
it.  If I plant my box responsibly, then when I remove it there is no sign<br/>
it had ever been there - no trace is left.<br/>
<br/>
Leave No Trace, in my opinion, is more about being mindful in your actions<br/>
while participating in nature, than it is about holding your breath and<br/>
tiptoing through the forest so as to avoid anyone ever knowing you are<br/>
there.  If LNT were strictly about being invisible, we couldn't justify<br/>
clearing trails after a storm or moving branches that are crushing young<br/>
plants - we would have to shrug our shoulders and say "Oh well.  Survival of<br/>
the fittest."<br/>
<br/>
I don't feel this completely rectifies the two, but it made it so I could<br/>
feel okay about it.  Until I came to that realization, I seriously<br/>
considered giving up letterboxing because I couldn't justify it in the face<br/>
of LNT.<br/>

Other than rearranging dead leaves to cover my naturally occurring<br/>
hidey-holes, I have not broken any of these principles.  (maybe Im not<br/>
doing something right :-)). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Plan Ahead and Prepare (more details and information) <br/>
<br/>
*	Know the regulations and special concerns for the area you'll visit.<br/>
<br/>
*	Prepare for extreme weather, hazards, and emergencies. <br/>
*	Schedule your trip to avoid times of high use. <br/>
*	Visit in small groups. Split larger parties into groups of 4-6. <br/>
*	Repackage food to minimize waste. <br/>
*	Use a map and compass to eliminate the use of marking paint, rock<br/>
cairns or flagging. <br/>
<br/>
Travel and Camp on Durable Surfaces (more details and information) <br/>
<br/>
*	Durable surfaces include established trails and campsites, rock,<br/>
gravel, dry grasses or snow. <br/>
*	Protect riparian areas by camping at least 200 feet from lakes and<br/>
streams. <br/>
*	Good campsites are found, not made. Altering a site is not<br/>
necessary. <br/>
*	In popular areas: <br/>
<br/>
*	Concentrate use on existing trails and campsites. <br/>
*	Walk single file in the middle of the trail, even when wet or muddy.<br/>
<br/>
*	Keep campsites small. Focus activity in areas where vegetation is<br/>
absent. <br/>
<br/>
*	In pristine areas: <br/>
<br/>
*	Disperse use to prevent the creation of campsites and trails. <br/>
*	Avoid places where impacts are just beginning. <br/>
<br/>
Dispose of Waste Properly (more details and information)<br/>
<br/>
*	Pack it in, pack it out. Inspect your campsite and rest areas for<br/>
trash or spilled foods. Pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter. <br/>
*	Deposit solid human waste in catholes dug 6 to 8 inches deep at<br/>
least 200 feet from water, camp, and trails. Cover and disguise the cathole<br/>
when finished. <br/>
*	Pack out toilet paper and hygiene products. <br/>
*	To wash yourself or your dishes, carry water 200 feet away from<br/>
streams or lakes and use small amounts of biodegradable soap. Scatter<br/>
strained dishwater. <br/>
<br/>
Leave What You Find (more details and information) <br/>
<br/>
*	Preserve the past: examine, but do not touch, cultural or historic<br/>
structures and artifacts. <br/>
*	Leave rocks, plants and other natural objects as you find them. <br/>
*	Avoid introducing or transporting non-native species. <br/>
*	Do not build structures, furniture, or dig trenches. <br/>
<br/>
Minimize Campfire Impacts <br/>
<br/>
*	Campfires can cause lasting impacts to the backcountry. Use a<br/>
lightweight stove for cooking and enjoy a candle lantern for light. <br/>
*	Where fires are permitted, use established fire rings, fire pans, or<br/>
mound fires. <br/>
*	Keep fires small. Only use sticks from the ground that can be broken<br/>
by hand. <br/>
*	Burn all wood and coals to ash, put out campfires completely, then<br/>
scatter cool ashes. <br/>
<br/>
Respect Wildlife (more details and information) <br/>
<br/>
*	Observe wildlife from a distance. Do not follow or approach them. <br/>
*	Never feed animals. Feeding wildlife damages their health, alters<br/>
natural behaviors, and exposes them to predators and other dangers. <br/>
*	Protect wildlife and your food by storing rations and trash<br/>
securely. <br/>
*	Control pets at all times, or leave them at home. <br/>
*	Avoid wildlife during sensitive times: mating, nesting, raising<br/>
young, or winter. <br/>
<br/>
Be Considerate of Other Visitors (more details and information) <br/>
<br/>
*	Respect other visitors and protect the quality of their experience. <br/>
*	Be courteous. Yield to other users on the trail. <br/>
*	Step to the downhill side of the trail when encountering pack stock.<br/>
<br/>
*	Take breaks and camp away from trails and other visitors. <br/>
*	Let nature's sounds prevail. Avoid loud voices and noises <br/>

it out", but if you look at the guidelines you quoted under that objective,<br/>
they all refer to trash, waste, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If I'm caring for my box and ensuring that it doesn't impact wildlife, and<br/>
if, when I remove it, there is no remaining sign it had been there, it isn't<br/>
trash.<br/>
