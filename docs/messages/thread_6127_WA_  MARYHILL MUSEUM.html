I'm sorry you missed out on the Maryhill Peacock.  It doesn't sound like<br/>
you were where the letterbox is.  It may take a little rooting around,<br/>
depending on your steps/paces, but it sounds like you were roaming<br/>
around the East and/or North part of that picnic area.  There is a long<br/>
row of tall bushes and within them the box hides.  It's not one of my<br/>
easier ones, but I do think it is probably still there and can be found<br/>
with discreet persistence.  (At least I hope so).<br/>
<br/>
I do hope you got to see peacocks while you were visiting the grounds.<br/>
If not, here's a hint on these creatures:  They will usually appear out<br/>
of nowhere if you drag a cooler out of your vehicle.  The Museum's<br/>
fine-feathered friends are like Yogi and Boo Boo at Jellystone.<br/>
At least in our experience on more than one occasion.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
