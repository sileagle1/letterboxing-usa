Such a shame that such a good article has to have perpetuated the myth that <br/>
boxes are buried!! I hope this does not get to any rangers reading it!<br/>

&gt; Such a shame that such a good article has to have perpetuated the myth that<br/>
&gt; boxes are buried!! <br/>
<br/>
Either the reporter didn't do his or her job, or the interviewees didn't.  <br/>
I'll stay out of the "publicity" debate, but I would suggest that if there <br/>
is a substantial inaccurate portrayal of hobby (I didn't read the piece and <br/>
declined to be interviewed for it), that the interviewees send a letter to the <br/>
editor clarifying the inaccuracies (if whatever medium this is in has some sort <br/>
of "letter to the editor" feature to it).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if someone with a bigger megaphone than you says something that<br/>
doesn't seem right, there is generally scant little to be done, but I suppose<br/>
if this thing is on-line, then it is not beyond the realm of possibility that<br/>
it can be edited.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
<br/>
PS - list membership has grown 10% since this thing came out, so I suppose it<br/>
was a pretty big megaphone (relative to us, anyway).<br/>

<p><br/>After reading the article online I noticed that there was a link on the bottom for a note to the editor. I clicked and sent an email voicing my concerns about the misrepresentation. I would suggest that everybody might want to do the same. 1000 voices are much louder than one.<br/></p></div>
