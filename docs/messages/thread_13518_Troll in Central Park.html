I have had only 2 e-mails from people who have found this box. I believe that it did not last very long. Unfortunately I am traveling out of the country until the beginning of the new year. I have actually recarved the original stamp and have the box all made up if someone would like to volunteer to "replace" the Troll for me.<br/>
