able to find the Cormorant letterbox today. Normally you need a boat, <br/>
as the box is on an island in Mansfield Hollow Dam (mansfield, CT), <br/>
but with the ice at least a foot thick, we were able to walk right <br/>
over to the island. Also found the Town Crier Letterbox in Chaplin, <br/>
CT. Worth the short hike the see the river exploding with ice and <br/>
water into Diana's Pool. Watch the trail though, as it is very icy. <br/>
Melted Letterbox in Chaplin is also in fine shape. <br/>
