Lehigh Canal Tow Path Boxes<br/>
<br/>
The Lehigh Canal stretches from MaChunk (Jim Thorpe) in Pennsylvanias<br/>
Pocono reigon all the way to the city of Easton at the confluence of<br/>
theLehigh and Delaware Rivers. There is a walking/bicycle trail that<br/>
runs the length of the canal. These are the first two of a series of<br/>
letterboxes placed along this former canal tow path. Clues for these<br/>
boxes will be given for travelers going in either the upstream or<br/>
downstream direction.<br/>
<br/>
UPSTREAM, from Easton<br/>
<br/>
Hole In The Wall Box<br/>
<br/>
Take the tow path/bike trail through Hugh Moore Park, cross the green<br/>
bridge and turn left. Due to construction, you will have to go along the<br/>
road for a short distance until you enter the Palmer Township playing<br/>
fields.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the bike path which rises above the river and follows an old<br/>
rail right of way, passing some newly constructed housing and then<br/>
passng under a highway bridge. Here the path will make a sharp left,<br/>
going down hill, through a stone railway arch  and reaching the<br/>
Bethlehem Boat Club.<br/>
<br/>
At the boat club, you can rejoin the tow path along the canal (turning<br/>
right).<br/>
<br/>
Eventually you will come to the hole in the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Standing in center of the tow path, peering through the hole in the<br/>
wall, you may then turn your head to look past your left shoulder. You<br/>
will see 2 Vs. The box is at the base of the more remote V, under a<br/>
rock.<br/>
