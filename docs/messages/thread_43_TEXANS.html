&gt;I'm into GPS (Global Position System).  In fact I have a unit floating<br/>
&gt;around in<br/>
&gt;Texas.  Do you think your students would be interested in trying it?  It can<br/>
&gt;show your compass bearing as you move from one point to the next.  At each stop<br/>
&gt;you can then mark your location, reckon it to a map, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you are interested, let me know and I will ask the TEXANS to forward it to<br/>
&gt;you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
Nice try Dan'l--Sylvia has it right now and her e-mail isn't working...but<br/>
I'll talk to her soon and mention that it is needed elsewhere!<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't exactly pinpoint where you are--I tried it at my house (which is<br/>
about 1 1/2 miles from the starting point of the Duck Creek boxes) and got<br/>
exactly the same reading I had gotten for the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I did something wrong...I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
Cool thingy though.<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>
