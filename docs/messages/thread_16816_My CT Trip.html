weekend.  Though I did not get the notification (lack of laptop on <br/>

To Irish Mum and B Weekend Warrior, thank you for your hospitality <br/>
and that great area map.  It was a godsend.<br/>
<br/>
I found 27 boxes in Connecticut, 1 in Rhode Island, and 5 in <br/>
Massachusetts, despite the shotguns going off (hunting season!) and <br/>
the frigid weather that moved in.  I can't wait to return next <br/>
spring at your next WARM weather event to meet you all.<br/>
