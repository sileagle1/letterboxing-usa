Clues<br/>
Calvin and Hobbes went out for a day of Calvinball. What better place <br/>
to play than at Calvin Park, 1248 Gladstone Drive, Rockville, Md. "At <br/>
last!" Calvin spouts "The public has FINALLY recognized my greatness <br/>
and named this park for me! I wonder how I should pose for my statue?"<br/>
<br/>
Of course the game of Calvinball quickly deteriorated into fits <br/>
of "Did not!," "I was safe!," and "That was clearly a touchdown, my <br/>
hockey stick made it to home plate before the buzzer! And besides, <br/>
you weren't wearing the tutu so I get two more dart throws anyway."<br/>
<br/>
So, they decided to play hide and seek instead. In the Northeast <br/>
corner of the park (to the right of the ball field), a small path <br/>
heads into the woods along the creek. Calvin told Hobbes to sit there <br/>
on the first manhole cover and count to eleventy-million while he <br/>
went to hide.<br/>
<br/>
Now don't tell Hobbes, but Calvin took 35 grown up steps up the hill <br/>
at 120 degrees. While headed uphill, he looked back to make sure <br/>
Hobbes wasn't peeking and smacked right into a tree. "Sure, Dad <br/>
says, 'go outside and enjoy nature.' I just know they're trying to <br/>
off me!" Calvin said rubbing his noggin. Still dizzy, Calvin stumbled <br/>
20 steps off the path at 200 degrees and smacked into a large oak.<br/>
<br/>
Figuring he'd better quit while still alive, Calvin decided to hide <br/>
right there under a rock and wait for Hobbes to find him. "Hobbes <br/>
will come by and I'll jump out and pounce on him! He'll never suspect <br/>
a thing, this time I'll surprise him for sure. . . I'll just <br/>
wait . . . until he comes by . . . and . . . ZZZZZZZZZ."<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, back on the path ...<br/>
<br/>
Susie Derkins comes skipping along the path and spies Hobbes. "Well <br/>
hello Mister Tiger, who could have left you here all alone? Would <br/>
like to join me for tea and tuna fish?" Being the perfect tiger <br/>
gentleman, Hobbes says nothing. He merely salivates at the thought of <br/>
the tuna fish. Susie interprets Hobbes' silence as acquiesence and <br/>
takes the tiger by the tail and continues along the path that follows <br/>
the creek. At the next manhole cover, Susie wrinkles her nose and <br/>
exclaims "This path has entirely too many manhole covers! NOT the <br/>
place for a lady and her gentleman tiger to have tea. Come Hobbes, <br/>
let's find a more proper tea setting." So, they went left from the <br/>
manhole, down the hill, across the creek and up the bank to a large <br/>
tree.<br/>

I am toying with the idea of a series of cartoon duos.<br/>

Boris and Natasha<br/>
Rocky and Bullwinkle<br/>
Bugs and Elmer<br/>

Maybe even some stamps from the Far Side.<br/>
