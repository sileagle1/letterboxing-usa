                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I'm annoyed. I just stopped by the Chicago Underground letterbox<br/>
on my lunch break, and its gone!<br/>
<br/>
Its located near my work, so I often stop by to check out the stamps<br/>
of the famous letterboxers who've visited, and to make sure the box is<br/>
well hidden in its proper place. But today it was completely missing.<br/>
I thought for a moment that letterboxers may have "borrowed" it in<br/>
order to stamp up in a safer area, but half an hour later the box was<br/>
still missing. Who could have found it by accident?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure when I'll finish making a replacement, and not sure where<br/>
to find a better hiding place that would not be discovered again, now<br/>
that the secret spot has been compromised. So if you are coming to<br/>
visit downtown Chicago and looking forward to a tour of the<br/>
Underground, sorry to let you down.<br/>

I made time during my last work trip to find the Magic Hedge - GREAT FUN/GREAT STAMP, but didn't get time to do the Underground.  Guess I won't get it now... darn.<br/>
