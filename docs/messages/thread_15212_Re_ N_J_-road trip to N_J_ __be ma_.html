I think we come up with all of these plans more as a way to keep busy.  As a <br/>
mom, sometimes you are overwhelmed with 101 tasks (all at once and most of <br/>

&gt;Ha!!  Great story telling!  Bring on episode 2, please.  Are you an<br/>
&gt;author or an English teacher?  Your writing has voice.  Thanks for<br/>
&gt;the entertaining narrative.<br/>

As a homeschooling mom of two I can definitely relate to this. LOL<br/>

We must be kindred spirits.  I'm a frustrated writer<br/>
and a mom too!  As a homeschool/soccer mom to one and<br/>
a drill team/soccer mom to the other - there's always<br/>
lots of sticky mom stuff going on here too!  Would<br/>
love to find a money maker too, but all I ever come up<br/>
with is more really cool stuff to do that has no<br/>
financial gain in view!  Latest of those things being<br/>
letterboxing...<br/>
