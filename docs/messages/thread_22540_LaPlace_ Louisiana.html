Hi,<br/>
I am in central Louisiana in <br/>
the Pineville/Alexandria <br/>
area.  We have THOUSANDS of <br/>
refugees here from southern <br/>
Louisiana.  I am not sure <br/>
about LaPlace, you can read <br/>
this article: <br/>
http://www.desmoinesregister.<br/>
com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?<br/>
AID=/20050829/NEWS/50829001/1<br/>
001/NEWS<br/>
Many of the phone lines are <br/>
down and it is next to <br/>
impossible to make calls <br/>
just in our area <br/>
because "All Circuits are <br/>
Busy", due to the high call <br/>
traffic with people trying <br/>
to get a hold of loved <br/>
ones.  New Orleans will <br/>
never be the same, it is <br/>
totally gone.  They are <br/>
unable to deal with the dead <br/>
right now and just trying to <br/>
rescue the living.  Here in <br/>
our town, all the shelters <br/>
are full, and we are all <br/>
busy trying to collect <br/>
needed items for everyone.  <br/>
I went shopping at Wal-Mart <br/>
this evening and just about <br/>
all the toiletries have been <br/>
sold out, and the baby items <br/>
and other personal hygiene <br/>
products (womans). The paper <br/>
products isle was empty, <br/>
everyone buying it up for <br/>
the shelters.  I have bags <br/>
of stuff in my living room.  <br/>
Cleaned out my closets, <br/>
clothes, books, toys, shoes, <br/>
your name it.  This is <br/>
getting long, and I could go <br/>
on forever, it is so <br/>
devastating!  Thousands of <br/>
people have lost their <br/>
homes, belonging and their <br/>
EMPLOYMENT!!  <br/>
<br/>

If anyone wants to help, but <br/>
they don't know what to do,  <br/>
maybe this is a <br/>
suggestion.   Have a <br/>
collection at your places of <br/>
employment and your <br/>
neighbors.  Then a check or <br/>
money order can be made out <br/>
to the American Red Cross.   <br/>
Our local Red Cross is: <br/>
American Red Cross Central <br/>
Louisiana Chapter 1808 <br/>
Jackson Street, Alexandra, <br/>
Louisiana 71301  I will give <br/>
my address to anyone who <br/>
wants it if they email me at <br/>
Sequoia_2@webtv.net with <br/>
Helping Others or Louisiana <br/>
or something of the sort in <br/>
the subject (so I know it <br/>
isn't spam!)  I know every <br/>
city and state has its bulk <br/>
of problems to contend with, <br/>
but this is a HUGE problem <br/>
that needs ALOT of help.  <br/>
Thank you everyone for your <br/>
concern and prayers!<br/>
