<br/>
We'll be heading up to PA to find some "Spirit" and "Honor", then <br/>
it's back to DE to meet a "sister". I've finally figured out where to <br/>
hunt for "Serendipity's Sister"!  Another Woooohoooo!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Btw, I also planted my first box today. The girls and I went out and <br/>
planted it. When my partner got home from work, we sent her off to <br/>
find it. She was our guina pig. LOL  I just need to tidy up the <br/>
details a little, then it'll be posted on the site. <br/>
Look out DE! There's a new letterbox in town!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I noticed today that there are 2 more new ones in DE, both <br/>
being about 2 hours South of me, so I'll have to take a little day <br/>
trip to collect them. There's also about 7 or more other ones down <br/>
that way, so it'll be a full day when we do finally get to go. <br/>
<br/>
God, I love letterboxing!  :D<br/>
