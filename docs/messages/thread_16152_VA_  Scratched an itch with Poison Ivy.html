                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow -- it's been a long time since we've been out boxing.  First we had the <br/>
school year to get up and running and then a new business attempt for me <br/>
(still working on it {translation -- still buying more of my own stuff than <br/>
selling any to anyone else :-)....}).  Then we have a hurricane.  GEEEEEEZ!<br/>
<br/>
Team BeMa did finally get ourselves together and psyched to go out searching <br/>
at Riverbend a couple of weeks ago (o.k. Da and I were psyched, the kids <br/>
were cajoled, bribed and slightly threatened....)  We thought it would be <br/>
great to see the Native American Festival while searching for the five or <br/>
six boxes we hadn't yet sought.  Great idea -- bad timing!  Team BeMa soon <br/>
learned the lesson of the sin of sloth (which means getting out of the house <br/>
after 9:30 on a weekend) when we crawled up to the entrance at Riverbend.  <br/>
We knew we were in trouble when we saw lines of parked cars snaking down the <br/>
side streets as we approached the entrance!  The park was jam packed!!  I <br/>
admired the chutzpah of the organizers, though, who continued to charge $20 <br/>
for the privilege or creeping around the parking lot in search of <br/>
non-existent spaces!  I guess if the traffic is slow enough, they venture <br/>
that you're getting a "tour" of the park after all!...<br/>
<br/>
Don't get us wrong -- we were happy to see this beloved local park so <br/>
crowded, especially since its funding had recently been threatened.  We <br/>
would have just loved it that much more if all these kind and gentle, <br/>
nature-loving folk had ventured out seeking the solace of mother earth and a <br/>
knowledge of native American culture a couple of minutes AFTER us instead of <br/>
before us.  Just enough time for us to find one lousy space -- it didn't <br/>
even have to be that close - although the ones next to the handicapped <br/>
spaces are always appreciated since they have an extra buffer area in <br/>
between the cars for those occassions when Miss Ma exuberantly throws open <br/>
her car door right into the side of another.  Note to look for some type of <br/>
little plastic door ding protective devices...  O.K.  I guess that is a <br/>
rather selfish attitude, but it had been a while since we'd gotten out...<br/>
<br/>
More days pass, Little League, Grasshopper science project, too hot, too <br/>
cold...  We finally get another chance for a quick hop to the dog park in <br/>
search of poison ivy.  Pup was a happy, happy dog as we reached into the <br/>
front closet for her leash.  She is a happy, happy dog, crashing through her <br/>
baby gate and careening into the front door when ever she sees us near that <br/>
closet, whether for her leash or the gardening shoes or the vacuum...  You <br/>
gotta love her optimism!<br/>
<br/>
After multiple minutes of twisting and wrangling and searching through all <br/>
that very thick fur (which didn't really shed off this summer) Ha was <br/>
cinched up and ready to go.  Not, mind you, that Ha really deserved to go <br/>
after peeing on our bedroom carpet three times in the last four days, but, <br/>
the kids did -- seeing as they had always managed to do their duty in the <br/>
proper place although don't ask me if they both always remember to flush <br/>
(darn those automatic flushers at school!)  and Da and I were raring to go <br/>
(just anywhere out of the house!!).  We figured Poison Ivy would be a fast <br/>
find, being as it was located near to Rusty.  As it turned out...<br/>
<br/>
Ha had a lot of fun in the dog park although there weren't many dogs to play <br/>
with.  Oddly enough, those dogs and owners who were there, reading quietly, <br/>
curiously started to leave soon after we arrived...  Perhaps it was Be's <br/>
enthusiastic attempts to get a dog, any dog, to chase after the balls he was <br/>
throwing or Ma's burgeoning "STICKS FOR SALE" business.  Ma believes in <br/>
advertising her businesses loudly and persistently.  Or maybe it was her <br/>
knack for sweetly sidling up to a resting dog owner and then proceeding to <br/>
point out to them all the deposits of dog poopie that she had thusly <br/>
located.  Some poor souls even went so far as to clean them up even though <br/>
they were old and dusty piles (the dog poopies -- not the owners).<br/>
<br/>
After an hour or so of play in the now abandoned dog park, we strode through <br/>
the double gates and hit the trail.  The directions were straight forward <br/>
and we located poison ivy with ease.  Yeah!!<br/>
<br/>
At that point, we realized that Poison Ivy's placers had most likely made <br/>
the same mistake we had when we went in search of Rusty -- the wrong sewer.  <br/>
This error had so very courteously been pointed out to us by Witchie Poo and <br/>
the Knights of Columbo almost a year ago when they had spotted us poking <br/>
around in the woods.  After desperately trying to pretend we were just in <br/>
the woods "because and for no apparent reason" and ignoring their calls, we <br/>
relented and got our first exchange!!  Of course, we tackle every <br/>
prospective boxer we spy now -- how we've grown (I didn't say matured...)<br/>
<br/>
We continued up the path to the second sewer on the other side of the path, <br/>
and, for a lark, decided to check in again on Rusty.  But, lo and behold, in <br/>
the spot where we thought we remembered him to be lay a pile (a big pile)  <br/>
(no, not of doggie poo -- we're beyond that now) of branches and trees <br/>
toppled over by Isabel!!  I tried to search under the debris for the <br/>
squashed holly bush and found it, but, couldn't move enough of the heavy <br/>
branches to seek the box.  Mary -- you may wish to check this out.  We may <br/>
have been in the wrong place (gosh -- that has been known to happen) but, we <br/>
believe Rusty may need to be moved.<br/>
<br/>
We finally gave up this second reunion search and headed back to the cars.  <br/>
Da and Be and Ma jumped in Da's car to head out for another kid-pitch Little <br/>
League game while Na tried desperately to contain Ha while arranging every <br/>
possible towel I could find on the seats of the car to protect it from Ha's <br/>
very muddy paws.  Who knows who got the better end of the deal?  The game <br/>
went long and no sooner had I shut the passenger side door and scooted <br/>
around to the driver's side, was I greeted by a muck-infested pup proudly <br/>
perched behind the wheel...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the fun hunt -- we hope it won't be as long until we go out <br/>
again!  BeMa<br/>
