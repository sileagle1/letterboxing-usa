Seattle and wanted to thank all of you that placed so<br/>
many great boxes.  I'm not used to so many boxes being<br/>
available in such short distances and it has spoiled me!<br/>
I managed to hit quite a few diverse areas of Washington<br/>
and Oregon (Portland area) during my whirlwind tour and<br/>
I ended up placing 5 (including 1 HH) of my own.  I also<br/>
got to meet several letterboxers at the two events <br/>
organized in my honor thanks to DVN2R SKR, who also carved <br/>
the first Event stamp (Oyster Exchange).  Special thanks<br/>
also to Rayvenhaus for carving the second Event stamp<br/>
and giving it to me as a keepsake.  Both stamps are<br/>
awesome and I will treasure my memories of both events<br/>
forever.  If you ever get a chance to visit this area, be<br/>
sure to let them know.  They love letterboxing and are<br/>
some of the friendliest people I have ever met!  Thanks<br/>
again y'all, for making my visit special.<br/>
