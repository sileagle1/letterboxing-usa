As most of you will know, Randy Hall decided that he could no longer <br/>
host the site on his server; his wife has been ill and the time <br/>
demands were getting to be to great. They are leaving on vacation <br/>
today, and we needed to find an alternative.<br/>
<br/>
Since the site has been located on several individual members' <br/>
servers over the past two years, putting great time demands on that <br/>
one person, it made sense to set up a site just for LbNA, which could <br/>
be accessed by a number of site managers.<br/>
<br/>
This is what we did earlier in the week. Files from both Randy's <br/>
server at pil.net and mine at sover.net have been copied over to a <br/>
new server at hispeed.com.<br/>
<br/>
If your Favorites/Bookmarks were already set to letterboxing.org (as <br/>
opposed to www.pil.net/malenkai), you may already be accessing the <br/>
new site. Randy has indicated that it may take a while for the change <br/>
to work its way through different systems, depending on your isp, <br/>
browser, etc.<br/>
<br/>
You probably won't notice many differences at first: letterboxing.org <br/>
will remain in the address window (which is kind of nice) and the <br/>
site may or may not seem faster. The more significant changes are <br/>
likely to follow: faster updating of clues and new features being <br/>
added are the most obvious ones, as a greater number of people share <br/>
the tasks.<br/>
<br/>
We thank everyone who offered support over the past two months. More <br/>
managers will undoubtedly be needed as we continue to grow. How do <br/>
you get to be a manager? Well, one way is to hide more boxes in your <br/>
state than anyone can possibly keep up with; then you get to be <br/>
responsible for that state's clues :-))<br/>
<br/>
The people who are going to be helping to manage the site over the <br/>
near future are Mitch, Randy, John de Wolf, Jay Drew, Jay <br/>
Chamberlain, Thom Cheney, Erik and Susan Davis, and myself. We <br/>
haven't sorted out yet just who is going to be responsible for which <br/>
states. Clues should still be posted to the entire list anyway, so <br/>
everyone has a chance to see them even before they are posted.<br/>
<br/>
We'd love to hear suggestions for new features. We know we're behind <br/>
on a couple of clues. If you sent in clues for a new box more than a <br/>
month ago, and you don't see it on the new site, please send us a <br/>
reminder.<br/>
<br/>
That's it for now. Thanks for all you have done, Randy! I hope you <br/>
and Lisa have a great vacation.<br/>
