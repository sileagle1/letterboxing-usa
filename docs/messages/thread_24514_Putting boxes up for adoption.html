like to put up for adoption, without pulling them. The majority of my boxes are place <br/>

I know I can take His Master's Voice for sure.  Not familiar with others out of hand, but will get back to you.  Sorry I will miss your send off this weekend.  Where in CT are you going to be located?  <br/>
