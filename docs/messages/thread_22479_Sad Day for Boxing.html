I know this has happened to so many of you out there but it really <br/>

much of yourself into.  This is the first time I have had a box come <br/>
up missing but it wasn't just one but two of my boxes.  I planted <br/>
them on July 7, 2005 and they were pretty much off the beaten path.  <br/>
In both locations I did find 2 of the bags from the inside of my <br/>
boxes.  I even checked several of the trash cans in the area to be <br/>
sure the boxes were not thrown away. No such luck. <br/>
<br/>
I am really sad but I saved the images and I will recarve and rehide <br/>
in the next week or so.  I just hope we don't have some nut case who <br/>
is going around removing boxes for the heck of it in good ole' East <br/>
Texas.  We don't have just an abundance of letterboxes in our area <br/>
so every single one really matters and to have 2 come up missing at <br/>
the same time is just plain uncalled for.  I hope this doesn't <br/>
happen to anyone else but odds are that it will.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to hear about your boxes. We just planted our first 5 last weekend,<br/>
and we put so much work into them, I know we would be really sad if they<br/>
were to go missing. What irks me the most, is when you find the baggies or a<br/>
torn up logbook- indications that someone vandalized the box just to be mean<br/>
 One of the first boxes I looked for had been ripped up, the log book torn<br/>
apart and the pages were scattered all over the area- it had rained, so the<br/>
stamps were no longer legible. I never did find the placer's stamp, and I<br/>
looked for close to 45 minutes. <br/>
<br/>
I don't really understand why someone would get their kicks out of<br/>
destroying someone else's stuff, but I think that these people must be<br/>
really unhappy and angry, so maybe they deserve our pity.  Or, on the other<br/>
hand, we can just hope that what goes around, comes around and they get<br/>
theirs one day real soon!  <evil grin=""><br/>
