Okay so is it just me or is this Team Rayvenhaus serious freaking addicted??<br/>
You know what the really scary part is?  I have to take credit for it! I'm<br/>
the one that introduced them to letterboxing... boy had I only known.  The<br/>
only sucky part is that they still live too far away for me to bum rides to<br/>
them to collect all the cool boxes they are collecting.  Should I be<br/>
jealous?? Nahhhh I will just sit back and watch them have fun ... and<br/>
perhaps plant a couple boxes in my area to lure them here that they wont<br/>
find so easily. <grin><br/>
<br/>
Take care!<br/>
Keep boxing!<br/>

Heya pandora.  <br/>
<br/>
        We're not addicted at all... We go letterboxing 4 times or more a week, I've carved my first stamp, a hitchhiker and have the materials to carve at least 30 or so more, plus the other materials needed for a box, I've walked the trail where I'm going to place some of the boxes like 12 times in the past 2 weeks to get a good feel for it..........<br/>
<br/>
        Naw, we're not addicted, we can walk away from it at any time........ Well, maybe we could step away for a day or two........ Ok, we could take a step back for an hour or so........ Alright, alright! We're addicted!<br/>
