<br/>
I sent a post to the postal letterboxing list with little feedback on <br/>
where the boxes from the PLB Ring have gone.  It seems as though many <br/>
boxes from the ring have vanished, and it has been months since many <br/>
of us have received a box or heard from our own boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If you have an Ancient Egypt Ring box, please let the POSTAL letterbox <br/>
community know!  Thank you to those people who actually log their <br/>
finds on atlasquest.  This helps us keep track of where the boxes <br/>
are.  <br/>
<br/>
Please send them on to people still participating in the ring!  (we <br/>
have at least two who have dropped out, so if you aren't sure that the <br/>
person you're sending to has dropped out or not, please contact those <br/>
in charge of the ring.... Scarab and JBean I think.)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your support!<br/>
