Nearest town: Plummer, Idaho<br/>
County: Benewah<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Spot in Idaho History<br/>
First state park in the northwest.<br/>
Created in 1908 from  7,838 acres of Coeur dAlene Indian reservation lands.<br/>
CCC built much of the structures in the 1930s<br/>
Today,the southern part of Lake Coeur dAlene has been returned to the tribe<br/>
who gave up so much  of their land for this scenic state park.<br/>
<br/>
Now that you have identified which Idaho state park this is, you can grab a<br/>
map and drive there.<br/>
<br/>
Take the park headquarters road.<br/>
Drive to the Chiefs Landing  trail head parking area.<br/>
Park and walk a short distance through the metal gate up the logging road.<br/>
On your right you will see a DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE sign on a pole. Shortly<br/>
past this there will be a trail off to your left.<br/>
Take this trail until you see the guy wire on your right.<br/>
Stop here. To your left are two trees. Between these trees is a pile of<br/>
blackened<br/>
debris. This is it.<br/>
I placed this before there was growth of any kind so it may later be<br/>
overgrown with plants.<br/>
Happy hunting. goattrails<br/>
