little boxing stint in the Freeport area (interspersed with some<br/>
shopping at L.L. Bean and lunch in Freeport) then hit a box in<br/>
Yarmouth on the way home. We had our first "real" on-the-trail<br/>
exchange with the Mepanj group (real in that we hadn't just exchanged<br/>
with them a few hours earlier at a gathering). Here's what we found<br/>
and didn't find (minus a few unmentionables)<br/>
"Maine Blues" - we were first finders at this beautiful new letterbox<br/>
left by Sadie and Russ - we also found the "Easter Bonnet" hitch hiker<br/>
here and will drop it off at another location soon.<br/>
"Osprey" - was not found (had several previous not found reports)<br/>
"Salty Hemlock" - found<br/>
"Royal River" - found<br/>
also dropped off the "Black Sheep" and "Plenty of Time" hitchhikers in<br/>
this general area. I know Mepanj picked up at least one, possibly the<br/>
second one as well, but I also heard a rumor that they might have left<br/>
something in exchange.......<br/>
