                    <div class="plaintext-content">geez, the last time i saw such an upset over numbers<br/>
was when the phone company screwed up my bill. And<br/>
they finally fixed it so all is well. anyway,<br/>
<br/>
went to the portsmouth city park today and could not<br/>
find any trace of "wedding bells", found a lovely spot<br/>
for "the warrior" and part of a broken pencil storage<br/>
type box, but no stamp or anything.<br/>
<br/>
"Stroke of luck" is still there, but may be under the<br/>
heavy-rain-combined-with-high-tide line, the box was<br/>
wet but the contents were fine. hiding under a healthy<br/>
chunk of asphalt. it was noted in the log book the<br/>
other 2 mia Oct 5th, dunno if it had already been<br/>
reported or not, my mail was down for a spell.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, it is really a lovely park, and is a shame to<br/>
have lost 2 boxes, so if i have somehow just missed<br/>
them please let me know and i shall cheerfully return<br/>
to look again.<br/>
<br/>
remember, its free(usually), its not fattening, and<br/>
most of all, its FUN.<br/>
