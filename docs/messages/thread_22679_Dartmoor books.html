I have a list of Dartmoor related books and maps here, including <br/>
several on letterboxing that I've read:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/links/index.php?id=88<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago, I picked up a book at a library used book sale <br/>
called "A Book of Dartmoor" by S. Baring-Gould. Baring-Gould was a <br/>
prolific writer on everything from history to topography to fiction <br/>
(and he also wrote the hymn 'Onward Christian Soldiers'), and this <br/>
book collects tales and describes the legends and features of <br/>
Dartmoor. The book was published in 1900, but in the first chapter he <br/>
includes a description of Cranmere Pool excerpted from a work <br/>
published in 1897-98 (I can't tell from the footnote if it's a book <br/>
or periodical, or if it was authored by himself or someone else). The <br/>
passage describes the pool as having dried up long ago and of little <br/>
interest, but that guides had established a jar by the pool where <br/>
they deposited their calling cards -- but decries the practice as <br/>
little more than a 17th century tourist trap, an effort to draw <br/>
people to an otherwise desolate and uncommendable location!<br/>
<br/>
Still, it was exciting to read an original source reference to the <br/>
origins of letterboxing. I'll post the excerpt on my web site in a <br/>
couple of days so that everyone can read it.<br/>
