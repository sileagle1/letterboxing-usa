Be careful though - before you know it, you'll be so addicted that you'll start carving rubber stamps, create awesome logbooks, plant boxes everywhere, find new places for hiking that you've never been to before, go to letterboxing gathers, meet a bunch of terrific people, and maybe even start postal letterboxing.  Your life may never be the same!<br/>
<br/>
  Enjoy!<br/>
