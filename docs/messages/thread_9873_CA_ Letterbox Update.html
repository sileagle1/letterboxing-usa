replaced it today, happy as a calm.  =)<br/>
<br/>
I've also replaced the logbook in the second box of the series since <br/>
it was getting pretty full due to the numerous people who've <br/>
discovered the box accidentally!  So anyone that wants to leave their <br/>
mark in those two boxes will have to return for another trip.  <br/>
<br/>
None of the clues have changed, but the URL is now at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/CA/LosOsosOaks which will <br/>
need to be updated on the California Central Coast page of the <br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
And now, although it's 9:00 at night, I think I'll go for a walk and <br/>
possibly hide a couple of boxes.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Ho hum, ho hum....<br/>
