<br/>
We could not have done it without the shelter donated by HSKK. The heavy rain would have ended it almost before it began if we hadn't had that big shelter! Thank-you again.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone who braved the weather and came out to say hi, talk about their adventures, share their stamps, eat and have fun despite the rain! <br/>
<br/>
In attendance (in no particular order):<br/>
Wanda (of Wanda and Pete) who is staying with me to do more boxin'<br/>
Franzsolo<br/>
Connie &amp; Nancy of Sister's act<br/>
Dog Bone - Nancy's grandson<br/>
Dog mom and Shibshar<br/>
Zayna &amp; Paddington &amp; their humans Brenda &amp; Keith<br/>
Snowbird<br/>
Emily<br/>
Patty<br/>
Salamander<br/>
Hard Shell Kamping Klub (Kevin, Ann, Karen &amp; Megan)<br/>
Rusty &amp; Druid (stopped by, but didn't have their stamps :-(  )<br/>
<br/>
I hope I didn't forget anyone! If I did, I didn't get your sig stamp!<br/>
We missed those who said they were going to be there, but didn't make it - you know who you are. We also missed those that wanted to be there, but couldn't make it.<br/>
<br/>
We also had some out of town &amp; other visitors that got some attention. Namely: K-Martha, The roving Pacific Northwest Event Stamp, A Little Birdie Told Me, Coffee Break HH, The Golden Teddy Bear, Flying Snake HH, Texas Traveler HH, &amp; Hummingbird HH. I think there were others, but I can't think of them right now.<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to get the photos up on the site as soon as possible, but Wanda and I have some full days of boxin planned :-)<br/>
<br/>
Today after the gathering, we went out to Metamora and got the 4 stamps out there. By the time we were done, the rain had stopped, so we headed back to Miami White Water and got most of the one's on the Badlands trail. We were running out of daylight, so we couldn't do the outer loop, but weather permitting, we'll get those tomorrow. Wanda got the Oak Leaf trail boxes before the gathering (pre-rain). <br/>
<br/>
It's been a long, but happy day and more activity is planned for tomorrow, so I'm going to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all for a great gathering! and to Pete: I hope you are feeling better! Thank you for sending Wanda, we're having a lot of fun!<br/>
