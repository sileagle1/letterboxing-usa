This is a link to a site which we have been invited to link to<br/>
by Mr. John Finch, a british letterboxer.  I'm bothered by<br/>
the fact that I get an advertisement every time I click on<br/>
something there.  What's up with that?  Do these guys get<br/>
kick-backs from the people doing the adverts?<br/>
I spend so much time closing boxes tht I am distracted from<br/>
the information there.  How can that be of benefit?  And what's<br/>
worse is that I don't see any clues there.  I must admit its<br/>
beautifully done though.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, maybe I'm just grumpy or something.  Will you all<br/>
help me to look at this? <br/>
<br/>
I have also been contacted by a repesentative of Eastern Mountain<br/>
Sports who wants to talk about sharing links.  No doubt they are<br/>
looking for a way to augment their business and they will probably<br/>
be willing to pay us something in exchange for using our site.<br/>
I said, "pay us something".  I'm not out for anything myself.<br/>
I'm firm on that.  This site is yours/ours.  Its your energy and<br/>
creativity that make it what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I know we had discussions about recouping costs if we felt it<br/>
were to become necessary. (These discussions took place last summer<br/>
for those of you who have joined more recently.) In any case, is<br/>
it necessary at this time to anyone's knowledge for us to recoup<br/>
any costs?  I've spent a few bucks on my boxes (like you all have)<br/>
and I've kicked in for a GPS unit, but I see no need to recoup any<br/>
costs at this time.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the fact that we are like a "mom and pop" organization. <br/>
It seems to me that we are made up primarily of kind-hearted souls<br/>
willing to give of their time and talents for the mutual benefit of<br/>
this hobby.  This insulates us from commercial enterprise.  Perhaps we<br/>
will NEVER need to do that.  We drew a line in the sand last year with<br/>
ILC - made a firm choice I think.  And I think we should stick with<br/>
that unless there is some preeminent reason someone is aware of that<br/>
would cause us to change it.<br/>

&gt;  I spend so much time closing boxes that I am distracted from<br/>
&gt;  the information there.  How can that be of benefit?  ...I must <br/>
&gt;  admit its beautifully done though.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Dan, when he points out that this page is beautifully done.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, I hate Geocities.  They let people have free web pages, but the<br/>
utility they provide to help them author their pages always sticks the code in<br/>
that makes the advertisement pop up.  Yuck!!<br/>
<br/>
The HTML code can easily be altered to make the pop-ups go away, but I'm<br/>
guessing that Geocities probably doesn't allow you to FTP the altered files to<br/>
their server, since every Geocities website I've ever seen has these damned<br/>
things on it.  Does anyone know if my guess is correct?  I'm sure that if we<br/>
could figure out a way to help Mr. Finch get rid of the cursed adverts, he<br/>
would be grateful.  He is not getting anything for the ads, except for his<br/>
free web pages.<br/>
<br/>
I must admit, on my own website I have refused to add links to otherwise nice<br/>
pages simply because I couldn't stand those stupid pop-up ads.  This is a nice<br/>
site, though.  I'm tempted to vote that we include the link, despite the ads.<br/>

<br/>
yes... they very well may.  Can you think of any other reason to have<br/>
advertising on your page?  I don't think it taints LB/USA to have an<br/>
innocent link on this fellow's page just because HE has advertising.  As<br/>
far as LB/USA linking to his page.... are there any other commercial<br/>
sites listed?  If not &amp; this would be the first, maybe a division<br/>
between the private and commercial offerings... just to serve as a heads<br/>
up to anyone perusing.  You were recently looking for ways to "spread<br/>
the word" &amp; I think good links in related web pages and commercial sites<br/>
are appropriate and effective.<br/>
<br/>
go for it....<br/>

site" ie, you get webspace for free, but you also have to put up with<br/>
all those annoying ads.  I *think* (and I'm not 100% sure about this),<br/>
but if you click on one of those ads, the webspace provider gets some<br/>
kind of money...maybe, I don't know!<br/>
<br/>
Although EMS is right in our backyard, so to speak (headquarters are in<br/>
Peterborough...hey, I should let them know about my Shieling Forest<br/>
letterbox...) and they are a good company and maybe we might get more<br/>
people involved in our hobby...the idea of the commercialization of<br/>
letterboxing is unappealing and I just wonder if "linking sites" with<br/>
them or another company may be the very start of it all.  I see no need<br/>
to recoup costs - what I've spent so far on my one little box is<br/>
minimal.  If I were to have 20 little boxes out I'd still not feel the<br/>
need to be compensated - with money, that is...visitors would be good,<br/>
money no.<br/>

<br/>
See: http://www.geocities.com/members/programs/geoguide/<br/>
<br/>
The Geoguide is a lot less intrusive than the pop-up ads.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  utility they provide to help them author <br/>
&gt; &gt;  their pages always sticks the code in<br/>
&gt; &gt;  that makes the advertisement pop up.  Yuck!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; sorta like this?<br/>
&gt; 	|<br/>
&gt; 	|<br/>
&gt; 	|<br/>
&gt; 	|<br/>
&gt;    \/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Just to clarify, it's not the advertisements themselves that I resent... it's the stupid pop-up windows.  They DOUBLE the load time of EACH page and then require me to go up and click on them to make them go away.  MUCH more annoying than the tiny 3 to 5 line advertising blurb that gets tacked onto the messages of our free talk list.  I recommend that anyone who has webpages on Geocities do what Marty has suggested to make the annoying pop-ups go away.<br/>
<br/>
As for the particular link that started this whole discussion, I think we should give this guy the benefit of the doubt by having Dan or someone contact him and ask him to:<br/>
<br/>
(1)  Get rid of the annoying pop-up ads.<br/>
<br/>
(2)  More importantly, delete all clues to Word of Mouth Dartmoor Clues.<br/>
<br/>
Until he meets these requirements, we should not support him.  If he refuses to meet the second requirement, we should FLAME him!!!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>

I found out about letterboxing from the newsletter from my orienteering club (DVOA) a couple of months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Erik makes a very strong point about trying to increase awareness.  We are dealing with geography on a totally different scale here in the US than Dartmoor is.  It's going to take more than word-of-mouth to spread the good news and reach 50 by Y2K.  <br/>
<br/>
One way to do that would be to associate ourselves (informally: NO MONEY!) with organizations or even corporations which we may have something in common with.  Maybe a link on some orienteering websites(as well as many other types of organizations: boy/girl scouts, hiking clubs, ...) makes sense.  Certainly EMS is the kind of company that is more likely to appeal to people who are always looking for an excuse to get outdoors (which is one way I see letterboxing myself).  REI would be another one.<br/>
<br/>
By the same token, I've really enjoyed the lack of commercialism in this group, so it's a fine balance to strike.  I would be for a link w/ EMS but I would want to know more about the specifics first.<br/>
<br/>
On a different subject, I'm going on a business trip to a state not on the map yet next week, so I am really trying to figure out how I can plant a box while I'm there.  I have a couple of thoughts about location, but this being my 1st box, I'm a little gunshy.  I guess I just find a good place for the box, and develop the clues after that, or am I nuts?<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep you posted.  Any input on the best way to plan a box in an area you don't know well yet would be appreciated.<br/>

Dear wolven one,<br/>
Sounds to me like you've got it figured out just fine...<br/>
and I hope you are "nuts":  you'll fit in better with the<br/>
rest of us that way!!<br/>
<br/>
For the record, that's exactly the way I've been placing my<br/>
letterboxes.  First I wander around trying to find that<br/>
"perfect" location.  Then I start looking for prominent<br/>
landmarks, etc. to base my clues on.<br/>
<br/>
But, as Deborah pointed out yesterday, letterboxing is an<br/>
individualized sort of thing.  This is just how I've been<br/>
doing it... some people probably do it otherwise.  Don't be<br/>
afraid to do it your own way... there are no "right" methods.<br/>
Just be respectful of the land you place your box on, the<br/>
animals that may call that land home, and the people who will<br/>
be looking for your letterbox, and you can't go wrong!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>

<br/>
I am going to have to chime in here and agree that I have no<br/>
objection to sharing courtesy links with sites that have a<br/>
logical connection to letterboxing, such as hiking clubs,<br/>
outfitters, rubber stamp suppliers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in our "Miscelaneous Links" section we could link <br/>
to a page that houses all our courtesy links.  In exchange <br/>
for these links, the respective websites would also include <br/>
a link to Letterbox USA.  This would keep these links all <br/>
together in a place where they don't clutter up the rest of <br/>
the website.<br/>
<br/>
It's very important, however, that we only allow our link <br/>
to appear on truly relevant sites that have a limited audience <br/>
specializing in activities that somehow parallel the <br/>
activities associated with letterboxing.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I have suggested to Dan that perhaps the Smithsonian could mention the<br/>
&gt;Web site address in a future issue. So anyone who read the article and &gt;is<br/>
still trying to find us would know where to look.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think Erik's neigbor in Vermont ( the man who wrote the article )<br/>
&gt;would be a good person to mention it to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Do you remember his number Erik?  I think we are at a critical mass<br/>
&gt;right now, so it may have enough appeal perhaps to warrant them doing<br/>
&gt;a small bit on it.<br/>
