mailbox full of nasty emails.....<br/>
<br/>
Would it be out of Etiquette to make a LB to honor someone that would<br/>
require a $5 (or more) donation?<br/>
<br/>
Let me explain.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor's son (he is 2) has a very rare disease that has left him<br/>
completely disabled.  Horse therapy (I can't remember the correct name)<br/>
is a wonderful thing for disabled kids.  Thomas was able to go for 5<br/>
sessions this summer.  However, their insurance company changed their<br/>
mind about covering this therapy and they were left with a $500 bill.<br/>
Thomas LOVED this therapy, and they saw a wonderful change in his motor<br/>
skills.  But, having 4 children (10 yr old twins, a 5 year old and<br/>
Thomas who is 2) and only one income, they can't afford to continue<br/>
sending Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
My thought would be to put a box at the center and ask for a mandatory<br/>
donation of at least $5.00 in order to stamp in.  ALL of the money would<br/>
go towards the $100 sessions for Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
Would you visit the box even if it meant making the donation?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all in advance for your input.<br/>

I think you have a wonderful idea and a helpful heart.  I think that <br/>
you would want to make sure to spell out the details in the clues.  <br/>
I would support just such a cause.  Here's some ideas that you may <br/>
want to consider.  With all the letterboxes that go missing I would <br/>
recommend maybe asking the finders to send a check for the donated <br/>
amount.  That way if a letterbox goes missing you don't lose the <br/>
ungathered cash.  You may also want to make it a postal letterbox <br/>
with a little bank in it to place checks.  I don't think it would be <br/>
a good idea to put cash in the mail or in a letterbox.  I would even <br/>
hesitate to put a check in a letterbox.  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it does well if you do it.  If you make it a postal please sign <br/>
me up.<br/>

<br/>
Any suggestions on a light weight piggy bank that would have a lock and<br/>
a slit to put money in? <br/>
<br/>
My thought was to ask the owner of the therapy place to keep the box<br/>
inside.  You would have to go in and ask for it.  At that time, they<br/>
would take the money and put it in an envelope that I would pick up 2 or<br/>
3 times a month.  That way no one would have to worry about their money<br/>
going missing.<br/>

&gt; skills.  But, having 4 children (10 yr old twins, a 5 year old and<br/>
&gt; Thomas who is 2) and only one income, they can't afford to continue<br/>
&gt; sending Thomas.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My thought would be to put a box at the center and ask for a <br/>
mandatory<br/>
&gt; donation of at least $5.00 in order to stamp in.  ALL of the money <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; go towards the $100 sessions for Thomas.<br/>

boxes.  Aside from the risk, you would probably wind<br/>
up with fewer donations because of the perceived risk<br/>

 Honestly, It would depend on how easy it is to donate<br/>
whether I would follow through on my good intentions.<br/>
<br/>
One way to make it easy to donate and to protect your<br/>
personal information by not having to send folks your<br/>
or someone else's address would be to set up a PayPal<br/>
account.  You could either post a clue page describing<br/>
the nature of the box and request that interested<br/>
boxers donate $5 to the PayPal account to get the<br/>
"real" clues, or you could post a request for donation<br/>
in the box with the PayPal account shown., and folks<br/>
could pay the $5 for the clue.  <br/>

I think it's a neat idea - and what a way to help<br/>
someone else!<br/>

However, if the box is at the location where the child receives the<br/>
therapy boxers could check in with the owners of the school and make<br/>
their donation before being given the box.  The school should have no<br/>
trouble keeping an account open for the child and the placer is not<br/>
responsible for handling any cash.<br/>

Maybe another way to do this would be a virtual box - and to get the<br/>
clues you have to donate the money through paypal. <br/>
<br/>
that would give me 3 different ways to help raise money for Thomas.<br/>

Would it be out of Etiquette to make a LB to honor someone that would<br/>

<br/>
Let me explain.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor's son (he is 2) has a very rare disease that has left him<br/>
completely disabled. Horse therapy (I can't remember the correct name)<br/>
is a wonderful thing for disabled kids. Thomas was able to go for 5<br/>
sessions this summer. However, their insurance company changed their<br/>
mind about covering this therapy and they were left with a $500 bill.<br/>
Thomas LOVED this therapy, and they saw a wonderful change in his motor<br/>
skills. But, having 4 children (10 yr old twins, a 5 year old and<br/>
Thomas who is 2) and only one income, they can't afford to continue<br/>
sending Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
My thought would be to put a box at the center and ask for a mandatory<br/>
donation of at least $5.00 in order to stamp in. ALL of the money would<br/>
go towards the $100 sessions for Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
Would you visit the box even if it meant making the donation?<br/>

Any suggestions on a light weight piggy bank that would have a lock and<br/>
a slit to put money in? <br/>
<br/>
My thought was to ask the owner of the therapy place to keep the box<br/>
inside. You would have to go in and ask for it. At that time, they<br/>
would take the money and put it in an envelope that I would pick up 2 or<br/>
3 times a month. That way no one would have to worry about their money<br/>
going missing.<br/>

Just my thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
I think you have a wonderful idea and a helpful heart. I think that <br/>
you would want to make sure to spell out the details in the clues. <br/>
I would support just such a cause. Here's some ideas that you may <br/>
want to consider. With all the letterboxes that go missing I would <br/>
recommend maybe asking the finders to send a check for the donated <br/>
amount. That way if a letterbox goes missing you don't lose the <br/>
ungathered cash. You may also want to make it a postal letterbox <br/>
with a little bank in it to place checks. I don't think it would be <br/>
a good idea to put cash in the mail or in a letterbox. I would even <br/>
hesitate to put a check in a letterbox. Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it does well if you do it. If you make it a postal please sign <br/>
me up.<br/>

In addition to PayPal, you might also consider the Amazon Honor System as a <br/>
way of collecting funds:<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just my two cents worth:  Personally, I would balk a bit at having to <br/>
pay a mandatory donation of $5--and some people would like to <br/>
participate, but might not be able to donate $5. It's for a wonderful <br/>
cause but you should make sure that people end up feeling like they <br/>
are rooting for Thomas, rather than that someone is trying to twist <br/>
arms to get money out of them--you would really want to work on <br/>
generating the warm fuzzies on this project.  I would require a <br/>
donation, and say that $5 is a suggested amount.  If the clues were <br/>
given in such a way that they told a great story about the therapy <br/>
and about Thomas and how much each session of therapy cost, maybe <br/>
something about his disease, and perhaps at the end there was a <br/>
picture of Thomas on a horse (as well as the stamp :o), I bet that <br/>
most people would donate more than $5.  I would also periodically <br/>
change the clues and the stamp with updates on Thomas's progress--you <br/>
might get people coming out to contribute more than once. <br/>
<br/>
If you had a special fund set up, letterboxers could make the check <br/>
out to the fund, and you wouldn't have to worry about cash/checks <br/>
evaporating at the horse center because of uninformed employees.  The <br/>
equestrian center might agree to collect the checks in return for the <br/>
foot traffic it might generate to their business--they could even <br/>
offer a special coupon offer to letterboxers for a discount on a <br/>
first lesson or ride.  <br/>
<br/>
How about a fund-raising, horse-riding, letterboxing gathering, <br/>
perhaps, at the center?  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry.  That was more than 2 cents.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My thought would be to put a box at the center and ask for a <br/>
mandatory<br/>
&gt; donation of at least $5.00 in order to stamp in.  ALL of the money <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; go towards the $100 sessions for Thomas.<br/>

&gt; People have placed boxes in parks that you have to pay to enter, so I <br/>
&gt; don't see how this would be that different, esp. with the money going <br/>
&gt; to such a good cause.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me explain.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; My neighbor's son (he is 2) has a very rare disease that has left <br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; completely disabled.  Horse therapy (I can't remember the correct <br/>
&gt; name)<br/>
&gt; &gt; is a wonderful thing for disabled kids.  Thomas was able to go for 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; sessions this summer.  However, their insurance company changed <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; mind about covering this therapy and they were left with a $500 <br/>
&gt; bill.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thomas LOVED this therapy, and they saw a wonderful change in his <br/>
&gt; motor<br/>
&gt; &gt; skills.  But, having 4 children (10 yr old twins, a 5 year old and<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thomas who is 2) and only one income, they can't afford to continue<br/>
&gt; &gt; sending Thomas.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; My thought would be to put a box at the center and ask for a <br/>
&gt; mandatory<br/>
&gt; &gt; donation of at least $5.00 in order to stamp in.  ALL of the money <br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; go towards the $100 sessions for Thomas.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Would you visit the box even if it meant making the donation?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thank you all in advance for your input.<br/>

I also think the way to do this would be to have the people at the <br/>
center control who gets the box.  This part of your plan is not <br/>
without precedent.  There are lots of letterboxes... both in the US, <br/>
and in Dartmoor.... that require you to go into places of business <br/>
and ask for them.  The additional twist of asking for a donation to a <br/>
good cause is new to me, but I think it's a wonderful and noble idea.<br/>

Yes, I would visit the box - not "even if it meant making a donation"<br/>
but because it meant making a donation.  What a caring and thoughtful<br/>
neighbor you are!  My cousin has a large horse farm in Ga, and offers<br/>
"Hippotherapy" with great results, not to mention the fun aspect of it!<br/>
Your neighbor might check with the NARHA.  They might be able to get<br/>
Thomas some discounted or "donated" sessions.  Just a thought.  Please<br/>
let us know if this worthwhile and meaningful box develops.  MayEve<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Letterbox Etiquette<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Ok, I am going to pose this question to the group and hope I don't get a<br/>
  mailbox full of nasty emails.....<br/>
<br/>
  Would it be out of Etiquette to make a LB to honor someone that would<br/>
  require a $5 (or more) donation?<br/>
<br/>
  Let me explain.<br/>
<br/>
  My neighbor's son (he is 2) has a very rare disease that has left him<br/>
  completely disabled.  Horse therapy (I can't remember the correct name)<br/>
  is a wonderful thing for disabled kids.  Thomas was able to go for 5<br/>
  sessions this summer.  However, their insurance company changed their<br/>
  mind about covering this therapy and they were left with a $500 bill.<br/>
  Thomas LOVED this therapy, and they saw a wonderful change in his motor<br/>
  skills.  But, having 4 children (10 yr old twins, a 5 year old and<br/>
  Thomas who is 2) and only one income, they can't afford to continue<br/>
  sending Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
  My thought would be to put a box at the center and ask for a mandatory<br/>
  donation of at least $5.00 in order to stamp in.  ALL of the money would<br/>
  go towards the $100 sessions for Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
  Would you visit the box even if it meant making the donation?<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you all in advance for your input.<br/>

  However, if the box is at the location where the child receives the therapy boxers could check in with the owners of the school and make their donation before being given the box.  The school should have no trouble keeping an account open for the child and the placer is not responsible for handling any cash.<br/>

    Just my thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
    I think you have a wonderful idea and a helpful heart.  I think that <br/>
    you would want to make sure to spell out the details in the clues.  <br/>
    I would support just such a cause.  Here's some ideas that you may <br/>
    want to consider.  With all the letterboxes that go missing I would <br/>
    recommend maybe asking the finders to send a check for the donated <br/>
    amount.  That way if a letterbox goes missing you don't lose the <br/>
    ungathered cash.  You may also want to make it a postal letterbox <br/>
    with a little bank in it to place checks.  I don't think it would be <br/>
    a good idea to put cash in the mail or in a letterbox.  I would even <br/>
    hesitate to put a check in a letterbox.  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
    Hope it does well if you do it.  If you make it a postal please sign <br/>
    me up.<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Letterbox Etiquette<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Ok, I am going to pose this question to the group and hope I don't get<br/>
a<br/>
  mailbox full of nasty emails.....<br/>
<br/>
  Would it be out of Etiquette to make a LB to honor someone that would<br/>
  require a $5 (or more) donation?<br/>
<br/>
  Let me explain.<br/>
<br/>
  My neighbor's son (he is 2) has a very rare disease that has left him<br/>
  completely disabled.  Horse therapy (I can't remember the correct<br/>
name)<br/>
  is a wonderful thing for disabled kids.  Thomas was able to go for 5<br/>
  sessions this summer.  However, their insurance company changed their<br/>
  mind about covering this therapy and they were left with a $500 bill.<br/>
  Thomas LOVED this therapy, and they saw a wonderful change in his<br/>
motor<br/>
  skills.  But, having 4 children (10 yr old twins, a 5 year old and<br/>
  Thomas who is 2) and only one income, they can't afford to continue<br/>
  sending Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
  My thought would be to put a box at the center and ask for a mandatory<br/>
  donation of at least $5.00 in order to stamp in.  ALL of the money<br/>
would<br/>
  go towards the $100 sessions for Thomas.<br/>
<br/>
  Would you visit the box even if it meant making the donation?<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you all in advance for your input.<br/>

&gt; I think you have a wonderful idea and a helpful<br/>

&gt; you would want to make sure to spell out the details<br/>
&gt; in the clues.  <br/>
&gt; I would support just such a cause.  Here's some<br/>
&gt; ideas that you may <br/>
&gt; want to consider.  With all the letterboxes that go<br/>
&gt; missing I would <br/>
&gt; recommend maybe asking the finders to send a check<br/>
&gt; for the donated <br/>
&gt; amount.  That way if a letterbox goes missing you<br/>
&gt; don't lose the <br/>
&gt; ungathered cash.  You may also want to make it a<br/>
&gt; postal letterbox <br/>
&gt; with a little bank in it to place checks.  I don't<br/>
&gt; think it would be <br/>
&gt; a good idea to put cash in the mail or in a<br/>
&gt; letterbox.  I would even <br/>
&gt; hesitate to put a check in a letterbox.  Just a<br/>
&gt; thought.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope it does well if you do it.  If you make it a<br/>
