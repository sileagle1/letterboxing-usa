Letterbox #4:	SNAKE<br/>
Placed:  	June 23, 2002 by niece Sarah<br/>
Time:           Round trip from parking lot 30-40 min<br/>
Clues:	As you enter McConnells Mills,  you will see the ALPHA PASS trail head.  You COULD find this box by hiking the Alpha Pass.  However, we had young children and grandparents so we drove a short distance to the parking lot.  <br/>
- From point picnic area<br/>
- Go down steps to road<br/>
- Turn toward OLD MILL<br/>
- Take trail (not road)<br/>
- Walk down all steps on trail<br/>
- At the bottom of the steps you will see a signpost with ALPHA pass to the left; Old Mill to the right; and a lifeguard emergency flotation device.<br/>
** If you are coming from ALPHA PASS Letterbox #3, you will see the markers noted above and the steps leading down from the picnic area.  You will start here with clues.<br/>
<br/>
- Follow blue paint on trees<br/>
- Follow the trail through rocks<br/>
- Go to small hand railing.<br/>
- From South end of hand rail turn 90* (degrees)  <br/>
- Head uphill (NE) toward large overhanging rock <br/>
- Walk to large overhanging rock<br/>
- Go to right side  (South side) of the large overhanging rock<br/>
- Almost to top of large rock there is a trail of small rocks leading to the left.<br/>
- In the trail of small rocks there is a double rock<br/>
- Letterbox is wedged under rock on right next to double rock.<br/>
<br/>
You can continue on the trail to find letterbox #5 (Covered Bridge).<br/>
