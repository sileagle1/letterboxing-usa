<br/>
I took a long walk today around Braintree. The temperature was around <br/>
55, the roads (all unpaved in this neck) were moderately muddy, the <br/>
trails still covered with snow. The snow, however, was firmly crusted <br/>
and easy to walk.<br/>
<br/>
All three of my Braintree letterboxes were accessible, and have made <br/>
it through their second winter in fine shape. It was nice to see some <br/>
new stamps since I last checked them: Lone Wolf, Kim, and Royce all <br/>
stamped in on November 6 (our first LbNA gathering) and Sarah had <br/>
visited the Braintree Panther and Mud Pond letterboxes on December 6.<br/>
<br/>
So..... they await new visitors for the year 2000.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Jay, I assume you will have completed a spring check on all your <br/>
local boxes by May 13!<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<br/>
And the weather was absolutely stunning in Valley Forge today.  VF Box #2<br/>
has had 3 visitors and VF #3 has had one (and I thought they were hard :-))<br/>
<br/>
I didn't get a chance to check on #5 yet, and there is some chance <br/>
Hurricane Floyd got it, so I'll try to check it soon.<br/>

Today I ventured down the bank to check on the "Prayer Rock" letterbox<br/>
alongside the New Haven River. It too fared the winter well. There was<br/>
evidence nearby of high-water debris about, so I am fairly certain it<br/>
was underwater a bit during spring melt. <br/>
<br/>
Best of all, several new visitors - Sara beng one, and three<br/>
non-letterboxers who found it by accident, logged in, and promised to<br/>
return when they get their personal stamps. Hooray!<br/>
