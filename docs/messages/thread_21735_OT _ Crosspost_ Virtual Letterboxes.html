<br/>
On one of the pages of my site, I've started a listing of other virtual letterboxes. Since I can't be everywhere all the time, if anyone runs across a new virtual box or one that I don't currently have in the list, please email me the URL and I'll make sure I add it.<br/>
<br/>
Awhile ago, there was a discussion somewhere (on Atlas Quest, maybe?) about wanting to compile a complete list of virtual letterboxes. Obviously, at the present time, I know I've probably just scratched the surface, but I would like to eventually have a more complete list. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help me with this, I'd be eternally grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Since not everyone is all on the same Yahoo group, I thought I'd cross-post this to get as much help as I can.<br/>
