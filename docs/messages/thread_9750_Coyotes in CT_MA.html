<div><strong>Thank you Kim (Rustypuff) for your learned remarks. 
</strong></div>
<div>The following letter to the editor from a vet tech/wildlife rehabilitator 
in our town may also help to educate folks about the coyote.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&gt; Dear Editor, As a licensed wildlife rehabilitator it is 
imperative for<br/>&gt; me to study the natural history of species in our area so 
as to be able<br/>&gt; to give accurate information and assistance to the public 
as well as<br/>&gt; render help when needed.  Therefore I was extremely 
concerned about an<br/>&gt; article written in the last edition of the Town Times 
about coyotes.  It<br/>&gt; presented several myths about this commonly 
maligned species that need<br/>&gt; to be rectified.<br/><strong>&gt; 
     </strong>First and foremost, to allay any fear or panic 
that was stirred-up<br/>&gt; over the emotional misinformation given in regards 
to human safety,<br/>&gt; coyotes RARELY attack adults or children.  The 
reference made about the<br/>&gt; Massachusetts attack (the first documented 
attack in the state's<br/>&gt; history--Cape Cod Times, 7/30/98) was NOT 
accurate<strong>.  </strong>The child was<br/>&gt; bitten by a single 
injured coyote that had been habituated to humans due<br/>&gt; to someone feeding 
it (Boston Globe 8/98, CT Wildlife 10/98).  This<br/>&gt; incident became so 
publicized precisely because it is such a rare<br/>&gt; occurrence.  As 
frightening as this situation was, aggresive acts on the<br/>&gt; part of coyotes 
needs to be placed in perspective<strong>.  </strong>The single 
fatality<br/>&gt; that occurred in California was 20 years ago.  In contrast 
it is<br/>&gt; interesting to note how many towns are considering regulating 
ownership<br/>&gt; of particular breeds of dogs, man's best friend, due to 
excessive<br/>&gt; unprovoked attacks.<br/>&gt;      Although 
experts differ on whether coyotes are native to<br/>&gt; Connecticut or not, even 
the most conservative estimates place them here<br/>&gt; at least since the 
1950's (CT DEP, Audubon Society, Wild Neighbors). <br/>&gt; Some fossil records 
place them here one million years ago (PA Game<br/>&gt; Commission).  They 
were driven out of many areas for a time due to<br/>&gt; development of their 
habitats and have been slowly returning to their<br/>&gt; previous territories, 
not invading us as was implied.  They hunt singly<br/>&gt; or with their 
mate, or for a short time while teaching their young, but<br/>&gt; not in 
packs.  They also keep territorial boundaries, which limits the<br/>&gt; 
number of coyotes in any given area (CT DEP, PA Game Commission, Ellison<br/>&gt; 
'97, MSPCA, Wild Neighbors, Fund for Animals).<br/>&gt;      
Coyotes are opportunistic feeders and will eat practically<br/>&gt; anything, but 
prefer rodents and rabbits.  Food sources may be more<br/>&gt; plentiful 
here, and while the Eastern coyote is somewhat larger than<br/>&gt; their Western 
counterparts, they seldom exceed a weight of 45-50lbs, not<br/>&gt; 75lbs as was 
stated in the article (CT DEP, Audubon Society, Natural New<br/>&gt; 
England).  Larger specimens are usually "coydogs", which can look 
so<br/>&gt; similar to coyotes that an expert's examination is necessary 
to<br/>&gt; correctly identify.<br/>&gt;      Many studies 
have been conducted by biologists and naturalists to<br/>&gt; discover the best 
way to live with coyotes and wildlife.  "Harvesting"<br/>&gt; does not work 
for population control and has several ramifications<br/>&gt; (SUNY, Crabtree, TX 
Wildlife Research Institute, etc.).  First, nature<br/>&gt; will keep 
numbers constant by increasing litter size from 4-6 up to 17. <br/>&gt; Second, 
females will go into heat younger and breed at a younger age. <br/>&gt; Finally, 
the pattern of parental teaching is interrupted, which leaves<br/>&gt; pups to 
learn on their own and seek out easier prey.  This is when<br/>&gt; 
predation on domestics is made worse, but there are ways to minimize<br/>&gt; 
such incidents.<br/>&gt;      The typical homeowner can do 
several things to discourage coyotes<br/>&gt; and other wildlife from visiting 
too close for comfort:<br/>&gt;      1)  Cut back brush 
around the perimeter of your yard.<br/>&gt;      2)  Be 
a responsible pet owner--supervise them, neuter them, and<br/>&gt; bring small 
pets in the house at night<br/>&gt;      3)  Don't leave 
pet food outdoors, as this attracts scavengers<br/>&gt;      
4)  Pick up fallen fruit under trees<br/>&gt;      
5)  Keep trash cans securely fastened and in the garage until<br/>&gt; 
collection day<br/>&gt;      6)  Call the CT Dept. of 
Environmental Protection or a wildlife<br/>&gt; rehabilitator if concerned about 
an animal's behavior.<br/>&gt;      Many of us appreciate the 
opportunity we have in this area to get<br/>&gt; close to nature and share its 
gifts with our children.  Don't be misled<br/>&gt; by myths or rumors.  
Learn about the incredible diversity of life around<br/>&gt; us!  They all 
have their places, and even we are but part of this<br/>&gt; glorious picture, 
and we are all the richer for it.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;      Gina
