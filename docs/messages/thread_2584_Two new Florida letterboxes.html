                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't know about others, but I had a very nice day kayaking down a <br/>
beautiful spring fed river in central Florida. Saw many gators, <br/>
turtles, waterfowl, and other creatures. The highlight of the day was <br/>
hearing a rustle in the bushes behind us and turning to see a doe <br/>
leading her young fawn across the river not twenty yards back!<br/>
<br/>
Both letterboxes are on Rock Springs Run in Seminole county with the <br/>
nearest city being Apopka.<br/>
<br/>
Common clue:<br/>
<br/>
You must find where the king has landed<br/>
there you can bring your own or rent a ride from him.<br/>
Plan for a day adventure as there is nowhere to get out for about 9 <br/>
miles of slow wandering river bank.<br/>
<br/>
Rocks Springs #1<br/>
<br/>
follow the flow until you must choose a path or go aground<br/>
You could choose wrong but I would choose right<br/>
If you make the correct choice you will see a clump of trees growing <br/>
in the water very soon. Check them out!<br/>
<br/>
Rock Springs #2<br/>
<br/>
Find where the big buck deer sleeps<br/>
when you see some sign of him take 25 paces into the woods<br/>
look to your left for a bent palm and rotten tree stump.<br/>
<br/>
These are also geocache boxes, but don't cheat and look up the <br/>
coordinates there unless you really think you need to do that ;-)<br/>

thought I had crossed into the next county but was wrong. You can <br/>
tell I'm no mapsurfer ;-)<br/>
