letterboxing is so great because everyone can both put into and take<br/>
out of it exactly what they wish. <br/>
<br/>
if you don't care for purchased stamps, you always have the option of<br/>
using the ask placer feature to ascertain that the box meets your<br/>
criteria before you go in search of it. adding a comment to the clues<br/>
about weather the stamp is hand carved should not be expected of the<br/>
placer. the box and clues belong to them; they are free to do whatever<br/>
they wish with them. same thing goes for those who disdain follow the<br/>
directions clues or boxes in certain types of locations. no one says<br/>
you have to get every box that exists. <br/>
<br/>
if you are a stamp snob, a clue snob, or any other kind of letterbox<br/>
snob; pray-tell what good thing comes from posting about it in the<br/>
manner most of these messages reflect? it doesn't edify or contribute<br/>
to anything positive and really only serves to end up making someone<br/>
feel bad about something that they created and placed as an act of<br/>
selflessness. this hobby is supposed to be pleasurable and enjoyable.<br/>
worse yet is reading those kinds of comments in a logbook.<br/>
<br/>
having those kinds of feelings and desires for a certain kind of box<br/>
is certainly your right, but keep that kind of talk among your<br/>
personal circle of friends, don't post it where it could cause someone<br/>
else to have hurt feelings.<br/>
<br/>
how arrogant those of you who confess to being a snob of one type or<br/>
another must be to think other players must satisfy your needs. take<br/>
responsibility for your own happiness and satisfaction, don't expect<br/>
someone else to provide it for you. try to live with a little more<br/>
appreciation in your attitude, you might find out the world is a lot<br/>
more cheerful when you actively seek joy instead of focusing on the<br/>
negative.<br/>

Being new - I don't want to offend, but I love the puzzles and the <br/>
stamps remind me of girl scout merit badges of old - some cute, some <br/>
head so-so - but always a reflection of having solved the challenge.<br/>
<br/>
I just discovered (I said I was new) the Q&amp;A on letterboxing.org to <br/>
figure out if your box is easy or hard - this is wonderful and helped <br/>
me to answer alot of questions I had and rate my first box I planted.<br/>
<br/>
This is the best family and personal fun I have had since I was a 4H <br/>
leader and we did orienteering.  Thank you all for your imput and <br/>

I must confess that for me putting my box out there is not at all<br/>
selfless. I do it for my own satisfaction and pleasure. Of course I<br/>
always hope that others enjoy my box as much as I do. But in the end I<br/>
must admit that it is for my own pleasure. I love when people visit<br/>
and find pleasure in my box. I try to make my box inviting so that<br/>
people will come over and over. <br/>
