                    <div class="plaintext-content">had a wonderful day of letterboxing recently that ended with captains <br/>
walk.  The stamp is incredible!   Box was cracked however, but <br/>
contents are in good shape.  Just a note, after finding the box my <br/>
friend and I went into town and had a whale of a time having <br/>
cocktails and food.  Met some of the locals and plan on returning for <br/>
more fun.   <br/>
