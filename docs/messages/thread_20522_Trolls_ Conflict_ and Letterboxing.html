<br/>
First, Mark, thanks so much for kicking that troll off.  I'm naiive <br/>
enough not to have understood the exact meaning of his post, but the <br/>
attitude behind it shocks and disgusts me.  I can't believe there are <br/>
people like that in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I have to say something about this conflict.  I tried to <br/>
stay quiet, but I just can't.  I am a registered, active member of <br/>
almost ALL the lboxing communities and websites that are available.  <br/>
I am also a fan of all of them.  (I'm speaking of those <br/>
moderated/maintained/created/whatever by people on BOTH sides of this <br/>
discussion.)  The members of every site that I have found have been <br/>
welcoming, encouraging and excited to see me get started in the <br/>
hobby.  I've e-mailed or posted personally with several of these <br/>
folks (again on both sides), and they are ALL helpful, nice <br/>
people...at least to me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
So, there you go.  I'm in this for the LETTERBOXING.  (And, yes, I'm <br/>
shouting.)  None of these sites are mutually exclusive.  ALL of them <br/>
are great sources of information for anyone who's trying to get <br/>
started.  I just want to encourage newbies who are reading through <br/>
all of this conflict scratching their heads (like me) to look through <br/>
sites, meet the people, and have fun boxing.  This is an awesome <br/>
hobby, and pretty much everyone involved in it is equally as <br/>
awesome.  Keep your focus on the boxing, and don't ignore any <br/>
resources because of the opinions of people who have been too deeply <br/>
involved in a rivalry for too long.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, thank you to _everyone_ who puts in so much time and effort <br/>
to keep the letterboxing community alive and well on the internet!  <br/>
Your efforts are as important to keeping letterboxing active in the <br/>
U.S. as the planting and hunting.<br/>
<br/>
Just an honest opinion from a newbie boxer.<br/>
