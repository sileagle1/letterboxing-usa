planted in Massachusetts.  One is a "mystery" box, although I don't<br/>
think it will be too difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Belmont Rock Letterbox --- Bourne, MA -- Barnstable County<br/>
Placed by:  The Yachtsman and Mary Manatee<br/>
Difficulty:  easy<br/>
Terrain:  easy to moderate depending upon approach<br/>
<br/>
The Belmont Rock letterbox was placed on Sunday, March 9th, 2003 in<br/>
honor of one of the people who was instrumental in engineering the<br/>
Cape Cod Canal, August Belmont.  The rock is situated at the second<br/>
scenic overlook on Route 6 (going from the Bourne towards the Sagamore<br/>
bridge).  If you want to read about Mr. Belmont and his exploits, and<br/>
to have a very nice scenic view of the canal, visit this overlook.  To<br/>
claim the letterbox, however, several other approaches will work better:<br/>
<br/>
1.  If you are heading eastbound from Buzzard's Bay on the mainland<br/>
side of the canal, park at Bourne Scenic Overlook, the first parking<br/>
lot on Route 6.  From here there is a pathway down to the foot of the<br/>
hill, where you will find the "Bournedale Hills Trail".  Head east on<br/>
the trail, until you come to a section where the path heads downhill.<br/>
 You will pass a very large boulder in the trail just before you reach<br/>
this section.  Shortly afterward, sight the closest high voltage tower<br/>
on the opposite bank of the canal.  When this tower is at 100 degrees,<br/>
you should find a U.S. Engineering Department Marker (STA 215 450 No)<br/>
to your left.  At this point, you are directly above electric pole #<br/>
215 on the Canal Access road.  This point on the Bournedale Hills<br/>
Trail is 0.5 miles to the Bournedale Herring Run, and 1.0 mile to<br/>
Bourne Scenic Park.  Turn around at the marker, and go back up the<br/>
path 45 steps; at 320 degrees you should see a clump of birch trees<br/>
with light gray bark.  Among this clump of trees is a multi-trunked<br/>
tree about 12 steps off the path.  Your treasure lies at the base of<br/>
this tree under a pile of sticks.  Please hide carefully after<br/>
stamping in.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Alternate routes to the box can be found by parking at either the<br/>
Bourne Scenic Park near the Bourne Bridge, or at the large parking lot<br/>
(at the traffic light) at the Bournedale Herring Run, which is the<br/>
third parking area on your right if headed east on Route 6 from<br/>
Buzzard's Bay.  In either case, you can walk the canal access path (or<br/>
bike it, or rollerblade it) until you reach the stairway near electric<br/>
pole # 215.  Climb the stairs, find the Station marker, and continue<br/>
your quest!<br/>

Gateway to the Cape Cod Canal Letterbox<br/>
Sandwich, MA--- Barnstable County<br/>
Placed by The Yachtsman and Mary Manatee<br/>
Date:  March 9, 2003<br/>
Difficulty:  easy<br/>
Terrain:  easy<br/>
<br/>
The Gateway to Cape Cod Canal letterbox is placed in an area that we<br/>
think is one of the most scenic spots on the Canal.  Then again, we<br/>
are boat people, and the open expanse of Cape Cod Bay beckons to us. <br/>
We wanted to place this box as close as practicable to the red<br/>
navigational aid that marks the eastern entrance to the Cape Cod<br/>
Canal.  Common sense, however, told us that it should not be placed on<br/>
the jetty leading to that marker, as storm  driven waves and curious<br/>
fishermen might easily have dislodged the box if it were placed among<br/>
the rocks on the jetty itself.  After inspection of the area, we<br/>
decided to leave it hidden under a lone red cedar bush some distance<br/>
off the most commonly used path to the jetty. Still, this box is in a<br/>
vulnerable place where many tourists and dog-walkers stroll, and where<br/>
weary bicyclists and rollerbladers stop to rest after exercising on<br/>
the mainland arm of the canal access road. Caution should be exercised<br/>
in approaching and returning the box so that the general<br/>
non-letterboxing public will not be aroused to suspicion.  Although we<br/>
do not anticipate a lot of problems arising from drawing attention to<br/>
the spot during the colder months, this site is heavily visited during<br/>
the warmer months, and letterboxers would be prudent to visit early or<br/>
late in the day during those times of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
If approaching Cape Cod from the north or the west, follow Route 3 or<br/>
Route 6 to the Sagamore rotary.  Follow the signs to Scusset Beach. <br/>
In the off-season (September to May) there is no charge to enter the<br/>
park.  In the heart of the winter, the road is only open to cars for<br/>
part of its distance.  In that case, park near the pavilion/rest rooms<br/>
on the canal access road, and either walk the canal path, or the<br/>
access road to Scusset beach until you reach the eastern end of the<br/>
canal.  In the warmer months you can drive down to Scusset beach and<br/>
park there if there is room in the lot  after Memorial Day, there is<br/>
a fee to enter the park.  <br/>
<br/>
When you see the red marker at the end of the stone jetty that marks<br/>
the eastern canal entrance, you are close to your goal.  Find the sign<br/>
that say No Swimming or SCUBA diving.  Put your back to this sign<br/>
(facing westward), and look to your right.  You will see several small<br/>
isolated cedar bushes off in the low dunes.  Take the "dune paths" to<br/>
each in turn.  From the correct cedar, the stack on the Canal Electric<br/>
Power Station (across the canal) bears 250 degrees, the red marker on<br/>
the jetty bears 85 degrees, and the closest green buoy bears 140<br/>
degrees.  Search under a patch of lichens behind a small rock on the<br/>
Cape Cod side of the cedar for your prize!<br/>

The Alewife Mystery Letterbox<br/>
Placed by The Yachtsman and Mary Manatee<br/>
Somewhere in Massachusetts<br/>
March 9, 2003<br/>
Difficulty:  easy, after a little research<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in Massachusetts the Alewife Mystery Letterbox rests close<br/>
to one of the many "herring runs" in the state.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  There are multiple ways to figure out the name of the town in<br/>
which this herring run can be found ---- after that, it's up to you to<br/>
find the run's exact location.<br/>
<br/>
1.  What does a witch do when she leans over her brimming caldron?  <br/>
    _________   ________   Reverse the two words and join them.        <br/>
    Although the spelling is a little off, you'll get the idea.<br/>
<br/>
2.	Another name for a person who makes beer is a ________________<br/>
<br/>
3.	The town was actually name to honor one of the Pilgrims who <br/>
        came over on the Mayflower.  He was William _____________.<br/>
<br/>
4.	Local legend says that the "Lost Dauphin of France" (the son  <br/>
        of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI)was brought to this town as <br/>
        a baby by a  sea captain from the town who was in Paris during<br/>
        the French Revolution.  The baby was named "Rene Rousseau"; <br/>
        later, Rene Rousseau also served as sea captain. Both the <br/>
        famous local sea captain (who has a park in town named after <br/>
        him) and Rene Rousseau were later lost at sea, and according <br/>
        to local custom, Rene Rousseau's name is engraved on his <br/>
        "father's" headstone.  If you look in the cemetery behind the <br/>
        Unitarian Church in the center of town, you can explore the <br/>
        truth of this legend!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
5.	Across from the herring run is an active waterwheel-driven <br/>
        gristmill.  The area around the Grist Mill used to be an <br/>
        industrial center known as "Factory Village", which included a<br/>
        tannery and a fulling mill where wool cloth was thickened and <br/>
        stretched.  Today the mill makes cornmeal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Go to the herring run.  If it is spring, take a walk down<br/>
to the brook and you'll be amazed by the number of herring making<br/>
their way upstream from the brook to the millpond and beyond.  After<br/>
enjoying the sights, return to the parking area in front of the run<br/>
and look up towards a grassy lawn with a picnic table and a stone wall<br/>
behind.  Go to the left end of the stone wall, and look behind the<br/>
wall about 7' from its end.  There, above a part of the wall with an<br/>
orangey,  trapezoidal rock, find the Alewife Mystery Letterbox under a<br/>
large stone with a grayish cap.  Note:  you do not have to take the<br/>
wall apart to find this box!  Please be very discrete, especially in<br/>
the spring when the herring run is thronged with locals and visitors.<br/>
 Better to return on another day than to risk the safety of the<br/>
letterbox when the area is too crowded!<br/>
