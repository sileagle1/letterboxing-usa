Nature Center in Baldwinsville, NY and searching for "The Beaver<br/>
Letterbox" and "Canada Geese Letterbox". <br/>
<br/>
St. George started the day out by showing Fly Doc and myself how to<br/>
use a compass and then off we go in search of The Beaver Letterbox,<br/>
sort of.  Naturally having the author with us, why bring written<br/>
instructions? D'oh!  St. George to the rescue!  Into St. George's car<br/>
we pile and we're off to get a copy.  Now back, we really are on the<br/>
hunt.  What a wonderful trail and along the way get some compass<br/>
practice in and discover, based on the strange compass readings I keep<br/>
getting, I'm either full of: (animal) magnetism; metal (lead? as in<br/>
get the lead out Hughes); or somewhere have a metal plate (I swear not<br/>
in my head).  We finally agree I'm not holding the thing flat.  Well,<br/>
all said, we have a great time figuring out the clues, and enjoying<br/>
St. George's company.<br/>
<br/>
The Canada Geese Letterbox we went alone and were rewarded with clues<br/>
that turn out to be a fun learning experience that led us on a<br/>
beautiful trip.  We  saw so many interesting things along the way,<br/>
including the whole root structure of a pine tree that had tipped<br/>
over.  This turns out to be a lovely box and a great hike.<br/>
<br/>
Hot &amp; tired we left the 3rd box for another day.<br/>
