some quick boxes.  Fort Trumbull is in good condition and well into <br/>
the second book.  MY was it cold out!  Very windy spot but a nice <br/>
view. <br/>
<br/>
Also stopped at the Jordan Mill Site and got that box. I think the <br/>
directions may need to be corrected.  It was listed as Rt 215, it <br/>
actually is Rt 213.  Also you go South from 213/156 to get to <br/>
Trumbull Road.  I found the box on the North side of the rock, so <br/>
either it was moved or maybe the clues need to be altered a touch.  <br/>
All in all, took me about 10 minutes of checking the larger rocks in <br/>
the S.E. corner to figure out "Maybe I should look on the other <br/>
side!".   Anyways, I found it so no biggie!  The stamp is <br/>
INCREDIBLE, I like it a lot... what good detail!<br/>
<br/>
Ran out of time after grocery shopping,I was going to do the other <br/>
Fort (Griswold) but I unfortunately need to sleep a bit means i got <br/>
called in to work for Midnight (Yuck!). Looks like no boxing <br/>
tomorrow means its supposed to snow a bit down here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
