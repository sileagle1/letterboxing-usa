Be advised that Native Plants #1 (Western Trillium) at Tiger Mountain in<br/>
Issaquah, WA will be missing until I hear that it's back in place.<br/>

"I came across your Western Trillium Box #1 today, quite out of its place, but<br/>
in exactly the right place for me to find it!  It was tucked in the hollow<br/>
base of a little tree right next to one of the trails northbound from Round<br/>
Lake.  Instead of being my boringly polite self and just leaving what was<br/>
clearly someone's little travel/hiking notebook, I pulled the box out to<br/>
snoop.  Imagine my joy upon reading, "Look inside!" Guilt-free snooping!! <br/>
Anyway, I took the box home to figure out what the deal was, i.e., what to do<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I know about letterboxes, I'm going to make my own stamp, stamp<br/>
Western Trillium, and bring it to its proper place  - probably next weekend<br/>
when I have an out-of-town guest who will enjoy the fun.  Thanks for the great<br/>
box, and the great discovery!!  Mariana"<br/>
