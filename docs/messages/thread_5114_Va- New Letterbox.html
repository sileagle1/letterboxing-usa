Difficulty- easy<br/>
Distance- about 2 miles<br/>

This is just our second letterbox planted (P2F9) and think that this <br/>
one might be a good one for other newcomers wanting to do some <br/>
practicing.<br/>
<br/>
The box is planted at Seashore/1st Landing State Park in Va Beach.  <br/>
We entered the park from 64th and parked in the 1st lot on the <br/>
right.  Start your search on the Cape Henry Trail adjacent to the <br/>
parking lot.  Our Family found this to be a beautiful walk and an <br/>
even better bike ride.  <br/>
<br/>
Down the trail past mile marker 2 is a spot with a bench.  If you've <br/>
gotten to the Kingfisher trail you've travelled too far.  This is a <br/>
great place for a rest so get off your feet for a few miutes.  While <br/>
enjoying nature from a sitting position find 195 degrees on you <br/>
compass.  This path less travelled crests quickly and you find <br/>
yourself joined by two sets of trees.  One is a young set of twins <br/>
joined at the base and the other and elder set of conjoined <br/>
triplets.  Now seems a good time to check your compass.  Once you've <br/>
found 225 degrees you'll see a small set of saplings just ahead of <br/>
you.  Under the branches, sticks and twigs is what you've searched <br/>
for.  Stamp in and re-hide carefully.<br/>

Lone Star Lakes is in the Chuckatuck area of Suffolk.  From Godwin <br/>
Blvd (Hwy 10/32) take Kings Hwy.  If you pass the volunteer fire <br/>
station you've gone too far.  The entry fee is about $1.00.<br/>
