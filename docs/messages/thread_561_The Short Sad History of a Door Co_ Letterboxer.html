Chapter 1: The Bare Necessities<br/>
<br/>
She includes the clues to available Door Co. letterboxes printed out<br/>
in the wee hours of the morning. Which might explain why she over-<br/>
looks the message that says the Cana Island Lighthouse letterbox<br/>
is temporarily out of service.<br/>
She also packs a tiny toolbox with carving materials on the off-chance<br/>
that she may have the time to leave behind a letterbox token and/or<br/>
carve one or two more personal stamps. Ha.<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 2: The Early Bird<br/>
<br/>
On the way up, the travelers are eager to reach the final destination<br/>
of Egg Harbor after a late start (naturally), and decide to try for the<br/>
Chanticleer Letterbox on the way back rather than on the way up.<br/>
The second mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 3: Cana Island Lighthouse<br/>
<br/>
The first full day in Door County she of the everchanging letterbox<br/>
name, along with her letterboxing companions, Turtleboxer, <br/>
Fairy? (I always forget her name), she who has not yet chosen her <br/>
name but is called at home "Her Imperial Worshipfulness" and has<br/>
been given a crown for her letterbox stamp, and she who shall be called<br/>
simply "Skeptical", set out after a morning swim for the Cana Island<br/>
Lighthouse. It's on the other side of the penninsula. We find the tiny<br/>
street that leads to the entrance, and park at the side of the road to<br/>
walk across the rocky causeway. It is dry, but nevertheless Her<br/>
Imperial Worshipfulness must be carried. Thankfully, it is not too long.<br/>
It is Lake Michigan, but on this side particularly it smells like the sea.<br/>
There is a short walk on a wooded path to the lighthouse on the other<br/>
end of the small island, and we immediately see the first part of the<br/>
clue. The compass is consulted, and we beat around all of the bushes<br/>
in a westerly direction..... it is not until I arrive home that I remember <br/>
the message about one of these letterboxes being out of commision<br/>
temporarily. I probably wouldn't have found it anyway because the<br/>
message makes me think that the box was in a tree that was further <br/>
away from the clearing where we looked. Ah well..., we then tramped<br/>
about the lighthouse keeper's house, and out to look at the rocky<br/>
shoreline. Beautiful spot!<br/>
We headed back for the car, Her Imperial Worshipfulness had to<br/>
be carried over the causeway again, and made rude comments about<br/>
the fish that had been washed up in the rocks with the expected<br/>
results. <br/>
<br/>
Chapter 4: Bailey's Harbor or Bailey's Harbor<br/>
<br/>
Since we were in the same vicinity of the new Bailey's Harbor<br/>
lighthouse letterboxes, we decided to try for one of those. We <br/>
read the clue which begins "Follow Ridges Rd from Bailey's<br/>
Harbor all the way to the end...." ~ found the village of Bailey's<br/>
and found Ridges Rd. and followed it to Lake Michigan.<br/>
Confused here because the road seems to end at a marina and<br/>
there is no sign of a lighthouse. We follow the road to the left and<br/>
end up at a natural area that is kind of a marsh... no lighthouse.<br/>
We go back to the marina and I ask a sturdy-looking deeply tanned<br/>
woman who looks like she belongs to one of the yachts in the <br/>
marina if she knows where the lighthouse is....at first she must <br/>
think I am from one of the boats, because she talks about taking<br/>
bearings off of the two different lighthouses and so on. As I look <br/>
more and more clueless she figures out that I am a landlubber and<br/>
points down the road to the right....<br/>
By this time, all are tired and hungry, so we decide to come back<br/>
another time and consoled ourselves with an early dinner at Wilson's <br/>
in Ephraim and lots of ice cream. Turtleboxer and Fairy? shared a <br/>
monstrous Wilson's Special Sundae that had about 10 scoops of <br/>
ice cream.<br/>
It's not until we are on the way home that I figure out that the<br/>
Bailey's Harbor in the clue is actually the Harbor and not the <br/>
Village. I blame it on sleep deprivation.<br/>
<br/>
Chapter 5: It Was A Dark and Stormy Night<br/>
<br/>
That's the last of our searching for the rest of the weekend....<br/>
the 4th of July we spend at the beach (and I actually took out<br/>
carving stuff but never got around to carving....) and drive up for the <br/>
fireworks at Gill's Rock (that's the tip of the penninsula) and the<br/>
next day we pack up and head for home after a late lunch<br/>
at Al Johnson's Swedish Restaurant in Sister Bay. (The kids<br/>
like eating here because the roof is made of grass, and when the <br/>
weather is nice they have goats on the roof.) Not today, though, <br/>
because it was beastly hot. The parts of the weekend Her Imperial<br/>
Worshipfulness talks about most are the dead fish in the rocks at <br/>
Cana Island, and the child-sized potty with the child-sized stall door <br/>
in the bathroom at Al Johnson's. Hope she remembers something else!<br/>
What I will remember is the very worst thunderstorm I have ever<br/>
ever driven in on the way home! Very scary and took an extra hour<br/>
or two to get home....<br/>
 As for the letterboxes, I shall return! And I have a couple of spots<br/>
staked out for new ones! <br/>

Yeah, my friends and I like to sing a little song on<br/>
these occasions called "Alewife."  It is sung to the<br/>
tune of a particular number from "The Sound of Music."<br/>

misleading.<br/>

Yeah, it's a pretty cool show.  I like the boat<br/>
regatta beforehand.  I ususally sit on the breakwater<br/>
by the Shoreline Marina and get splashed by their<br/>
wake.<br/>
<br/>
 and the<br/>

Glad to hear you are undaunted by the results of your<br/>
first expedition!  And it'd be great fun to hunt for<br/>
more letterboxes in Door Co. than just Die's and my<br/>
own.  (I suppose if I can plant them in Madison you<br/>
can do so in Door Co.!)  Now if we could only get<br/>
those busy East and West Coast letterboxers to visit<br/>
the Midwest for a change, that'd be something!  Good<br/>
luck with new boxes!<br/>

Nah.... I'm sure it was sleep deprivation.... I had the<br/>
