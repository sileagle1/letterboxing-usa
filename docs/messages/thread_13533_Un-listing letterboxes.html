Just to let everyone know, there's no rule or mind-set that we <br/>
shouldn't take missing letterboxes off the LbNA website. In fact, we <br/>
do it all the time. I admit that we're not as quick on the trigger as <br/>
some folks would like. We move at a more elegant, stately, <br/>
Dartmoorian pace.<br/>
<br/>
Most folks with their own websites try pretty hard to keep their <br/>
clues up to date. Now, with the new site, everyone can do so: feel <br/>
free to post "last found on ___" "reported missing by ___" stuff as <br/>
often as you want. It's instant: clicking send uploads faster than my <br/>
own personal website.<br/>
<br/>
The reasons to be careful about pulling orphaned boxes have been well <br/>
discussed: the obvious is that many (most?) "it's missing" posts <br/>
would be more accurately put as "not found." The more fundamental <br/>
reason has to do with underlying principles here: we believe those <br/>
are YOUR letterboxes, not ours. We don't preapprove or edit clues. <br/>
It's kind of an intellectual property/copyright thing. It's a dot-<br/>
org, not dot-com philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Still, if it's pretty obvious that orphaned boxes really are missing, <br/>
they do get unlisted. <br/>
<br/>
For the several Oregon boxes that are a current topic, this <br/>
California transplant has learned something from Connecticut yankees: <br/>
those treasured historic boxes would long ago have been adopted, <br/>
recarved, replaced. Might be better than yanking them.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps one of the problems with the "system" is that we wait for a <br/>
groundswelling of voices concurring on the missing status of a box, a <br/>
growing consensus that finally gets a bit exasperated with our <br/>
glacial pace. It's surprising how much emotion gets generated by <br/>
letterboxing. Finding a box is a genuine thrill, exhilarating! Not <br/>
finding a box is often felt just as strongly, only not as <br/>
disappointment but rather often as outright affrontery, and expressed <br/>
with frustration and even anger.<br/>
<br/>
Here's an old, old post once recieved that perhaps illustrates things:<br/>
&gt;&gt;Now, for the unsoliticited criticism.  My family and I just spent a <br/>
week up at ---, and we tried to find three of your letterboxes with <br/>
absolutely no luck.  This is supposed to be a fun sport, not a <br/>
tortuous one.  We weren't sure we'd figured out the answers to your <br/>
clues correctly and so sought the advice of many skilled and smart <br/>
friends.  My husband and I are no dummies and have found lots of <br/>
other boxes and I particularly enjoy puzzles, but your clues to ---, -<br/>
--, and --- were simply too difficult and ambiguous.  Among the <br/>
perhaps 20 adults working on your clues, we still weren't sure we had <br/>
the right answers.  We then did the hikes and were unsuccessful at <br/>
all three.  We didn't even try --- knowing that other people before <br/>
us had been unsuccessful.  I can't tell you how frustrated -- and <br/>
angry -- we were, and my two children, ages 8 and 11, are ready to <br/>
quit letterboxing permanently.  If you can't provide decent, clear <br/>
clues, please don't do them at all.  <br/>

Jay, just returned from checking (for the third time), a letterbox <br/>
erroneously reported as missing that ain't. Did have to replace the <br/>
full logbook, though.<br/>
