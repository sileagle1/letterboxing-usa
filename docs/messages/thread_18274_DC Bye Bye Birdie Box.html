I loaded all the props into the truck and rode away, forgetting to <br/>

Would someone/anyone be kind enough to drop in there and pull it from <br/>
its hiding place and set it free as a hitcher?<br/>

Go downstairs to the restrooms.<br/>

The Temporary Bye Bye Birdie Letterbox can be found wedged beneath <br/>
where the telephone should be in the Telephone Booth closest to the  <br/>
women's restroom.<br/>

I hope you can get in, and if they give you any lip, you're just <br/>
making an emergency bathroom stop downstairs?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if ANYONE stamped in...it was only there for the week, <br/>
and I was too busy getting yelled at by the director to check on it.<br/>
