                    <div class="plaintext-content">Rushed right out after I saw this announcement to 'cast my vote' -- <br/>
but the first box had the wrong candidate. . . er stamp. . . so I <br/>
moved on (of course I hadn't been to either of these boxes so I <br/>
actually had to look for them.)  At the second box I picked up Kerry <br/>
and he will be riding with Mary of Virginia and I to Lancaster PA <br/>
where we will make a campaign stop before we meet up with mizscarlet <br/>
and hikers-n-hounds.  Hopefully Kerry can hitch a ride to another <br/>
campaign stop in DE.  I wouldn't endeavor to force my politics on <br/>
others. . . but a stamp . . . that I would.  Hopefully these Red-Hat <br/>
Box'rs will play along and Kerry won't be left glad handing in <br/>
Lancaster!  I haven't check'd the voting demographics, but I thought <br/>
it best to move Kerry North where there are at least a lot of <br/>
campaign stops he can make.  So within 48 hours of hitting the trail, <br/>
Kerry could possibly have 4 stamps, 2 stops, and 2 states = 8 votes!<br/>
<br/>
I guess his opponent will just have to wait it out in the bush until <br/>
some fair weather boxer/voter happens along.<br/>

P.S. Thanks for getting me off my butt and I was still able to get <br/>
ahead of the rain by 20 minutes.<br/>

&gt; I have released a set of hitchhikers for the 2004 Campaign Trail <br/>
&gt; Hitchhiker Race.  The two hitchhikers are Kerry and Bush and they <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; travelling seperately on the campaign trail in an attempt to "win" <br/>
&gt; the most electoral votes.  Each candidate will win one electoral <br/>
vote <br/>
&gt; for each person (personal stamp) they greet, and one for each <br/>
&gt; campaign stop (letterbox) they reach.  In addition, they will win <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; extra electoral vote for each state they visit.  The candidate with <br/>
&gt; the most electoral votes by Nov 4 is the winner.  Hmmmm.  Sound   <br/>
&gt; confusing?  I guess it is still easier than counting chads!!  <br/>
&gt; There are only 2 months until the election and the race is very <br/>
&gt; close, so the candidates need to move quickly to win.  And both <br/>
WANT <br/>
&gt; to win so they are willing to do whatever it takes--even if it <br/>
means <br/>
&gt; bending the rules a bit.  WIth that in mind, I will tell you where <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; released the hitchhikers--one in Ma's Artistic Box in Vienna VA and <br/>
&gt; the other in Be's Search for the Mushroom Kingdom, also in Vienna, <br/>
&gt; VA.  They are anxious to move on to some swing states...<br/>
&gt; In the spirit of letterboxing, please move the hitchhikers along, <br/>
&gt; even if it is not your favorite candidate.  REMEMBER, this is meant <br/>
&gt; for fun and it NOT a political statement.<br/>
&gt; Please keep the group updated on the hitchhikers whereabouts...<br/>
&gt; And please remember to vote--every vote counts.<br/>
