better if we didn't empty the inky water that forms in <br/>
some letterboxes directly onto the snow where the box is <br/>
placed!! (haha)..by the way...it was REALLY easy for my <br/>
niece to find The Elephant Rock letterbox (with blue <br/>
ink!!) a few weekends ago!  Still had a great day with <br/>
wonderful weather!<br/>
