     You guys in CT can get an easy 20 in a day! The rest of the <br/>

:-) Don't be sad. You are having fun, right ?? Numbers do not mean we <br/>
are having better fun.<br/>
FYI, there actually is a 'club ' for us PFX 1000 also, but for some <br/>
reason ? it is not mentioned. We do not bragg but I know that Bluebird <br/>
as well  has reached and gone by the 1000 number.  You are right, here <br/>
in Ct, it is easy if you like to hike and have or make the time. <br/>
Letterboxes do not make the trails better, but sure  more interesting . :-)<br/>

I mostly enjoy meeting people, going to places so close to home that <br/>
I never knew existed, collecting all the wonderful stamps and hiking <br/>

and just seem to laugh our way through some tough hikes. How lucky I <br/>
am to have a 13 year old that wants to spend time with her mom. <br/>
      Thanks to all who plant and those brave enough to stop me on <br/>
the trail to ask, "Are you a letterboxer?" I've made new friends in <br/>
person and on list. <br/>

and trails,and didn't tire out too quickly, I'd say<br/>
you had a chance of getting 40 just in this one town<br/>
in a day. You are right, numbers really mean anything.<br/>
People use the numbers as a goal sometimes. When I got<br/>
close to 500 PFX I also pushed a little harder just to<br/>
get to that number. My biggest plans this year for<br/>
hiking is on trails that I won't be finding any new<br/>
letterboxes. I do plan on planting some though while<br/>
I'm out there. The hike is first for me and the box<br/>
count second. I must admit,there are days when I just<br/>
go out and get the "easy ones" and I guess thats for<br/>
the count and to get some new stamp images. You might<br/>
say we all have a collection of stamp art. I still<br/>
think that some of our better and tougher walks were<br/>
to get just 1 or 2 boxes and I remember the walk<br/>
better than the actual box.....Chuck and Molly<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just discovered the list of PFX clubs. I don't know when we passed the<br/>
500 PFX mark but we hit F500 on Sep 4, 2005. As of Oct 13, 2005 we<br/>
have found 639 boxes, have 53 exchanges, and have adopted one box. All<br/>
this is perhaps small potatoes for lots of folks, but we feel good<br/>
about our efforts, given that we "officially" started letterboxing<br/>
just last February.  However, we are not on any PFX list other than<br/>
atlasquest.<br/>

I don't use this email address often and rarely check this group. You<br/>
can reach me via LnNE list.<br/>
