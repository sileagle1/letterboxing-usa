Team Rayvenhaus has been boxing recently and we are far, far behind on our SitRep's, therefore, without further adieu, we bring you, the latest Rayvenhaus report....<br/>
<br/>
We went back and completed the Flight Lines Series by Amanda from Seattle and she was right! The Alaskan Airlines is an Awesome stamp!!! So, all boxes, save the Delta one which was MIA. (darn it!)<br/>
<br/>
On the 19th of July, we went to Carkeek part and found the Unicorn and Pixie Witch doing well, but couldn't find the Sand Castle Box.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the upper portion of the park and found the Carkeek Salmon Series, Ida, King and Salmon run and came across the Lost Hiker hitchhiker stamp which we are relocating to Tacoma, Wa.<br/>
<br/>
We then traveled to Lincoln par and found the Lincoln Park Stump, the Vashon Ferry and the Lincoln Park boxes.<br/>
<br/>
On the 24th we went to Pt. Defiance and got the Point Defiance #1 but could not find Pt. Defiance #2.  We did pick up the Forest Gnome almost by stumbling across it.<br/>
<br/>
On the 25th we went back to Ft. Steilacoom and got the Fledgling, the Ft. Steilacoom Haunted House, and the clown series, Froclown, Jolly clown and Feets da Clown.<br/>
<br/>
We went back yesterday and deciphered the Weepy the Clown clues and found him, along with, Aunt Beth and Keche.  In the process, we found what was left of the SSLF box, which we had put in to adopt, so we picked it up and brought it back home to repair and replant.<br/>
<br/>
We're going out tonight to locate the boxes we've out in to adopt, so another night of letterboxing fun will be had by all.... No matter what their sexual, religious or underwear color preference may be.<br/>

Well, we are giving a situation report..... And I for one, having spent considerable time underwater while in the military, had a lot of time to contemplate things and thus, military terminology has permeated my vocabulary.<br/>

It found it's way into letterboxing quite by accident I am sure, some ex-military used it one day and it sounded kewl, therefore, others started to use it. For me, it was natural to give a sitrep for forays we had done.<br/>
