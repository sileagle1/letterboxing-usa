<br/>
My cousin and I went on a hike in the Columbia Gorge today.  Horsetail,<br/>
Ponytail and Triple Falls were gorgeous!  We checked out the Triple<br/>
Falls Letterbox placed by Der Mad Stamper.  It is alive and well and<br/>
still more non-letterboxers find it than letterboxers do.  But they are<br/>
respectful, leave notes and replace the box.  The log book has a few<br/>
sheets left to stamp in, but it's getting very full.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Lori "Lucky Charm" Lott, I was able to finally achieve the<br/>
Multnomah Falls letterbox image I've wanted to have in my logbook for so<br/>
long.  Third time is a charm and my cousin is nothing but good luck!!!<br/>
What a great way to end a beautiful day in the Gorge.  I can't believe<br/>
that I finally found this box.  YIPPEE!!!  I only wish Pony Tail was<br/>
still there, although, I've found the hiding place before and know it's<br/>
been missing for quite sometime.  <br/>
<br/>
This was a day of wonderful scenery and company complimented by<br/>
letterboxing that I didn't think I'd be able to do.  Yowza!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Congrats on finally finding the Multnomah Falls box!  You've joined <br/>
an elusive club of letterboxes....  =)<br/>
