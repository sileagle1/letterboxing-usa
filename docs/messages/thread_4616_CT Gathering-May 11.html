I've made some map copies and started marking them up, but I'm afraid <br/>
I'll be updating them up to the last minute as we have an abundance of <br/>
new letterboxes in south-central CT!  There are certainly enough boxes <br/>
right in Sleeping Giant to keep a body busy, but a lot of us have <br/>
already visited most of them, so sojourning off-site will be easier <br/>
with maps.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, I was figuring on an all-day potluck style picnic going <br/>
on, so that whenever anyone gets to stop in they can eat. I'll hang <br/>
about the picnic area all day to hold down the fort. There are also <br/>
grills available so if we just start up some charcoal it will be ready <br/>
if anyone wants to bring their own burgers/dogs to have a hot lunch <br/>
(and marshmallows for dessert). <br/>
<br/>
I'll be making one event stamp, and everyone is, of course, invited to <br/>
make another or to place some boxes-for-the-day too. This is gonna be <br/>
a blast!<br/>
<br/>
Cya there,<br/>
