&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;  From the letterboxes that you've done, it<br/>
&gt;&gt;  sounds like you're in eastern Ct. like us.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yup, we're in Glastonbury. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt; try  www.letterboxing.org&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I've had no problem with letterboxing.org; that's been great!  The<br/>
&gt;problem I'm having is with letterboxing.COM, which I understand is the<br/>
&gt;site I'd need if I'm looking for clues in places other than North<br/>
&gt;America.  We'll be visiting Portugal over xmas and were hoping to see if<br/>
&gt;there are any boxes to find there and/or maybe plant our first on xmas<br/>
&gt;day.  Does anybody here have experience with letterboxing.com or know of<br/>
&gt;a different url I should try?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

Sorry about the letterboxing.COM site not being up at this moment. It <br/>
runs on my server and I have been changing ISP providers. I expected <br/>
to have things switched this week, but ran into an unexpected glitch <br/>
with my DSL connection. I will be out of town over the next few days <br/>
but hopefully will get the phone company to fix it next week. There <br/>
are no boxes in Portugal that I am aware of. If you plant some boxes <br/>
there you certainly are welcome to list them on the site. Sorry about <br/>
the current technical problems, but it should be resolved very soon. <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
