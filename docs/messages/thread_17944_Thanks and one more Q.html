 We live in Las Vegas.   <br/>
<br/>
We are having discussions with kids on both impact of the environment, and not drawing attention to ourselves.  There are several boxes in casinos which will be an additional problem with kids.  Kids are allowed to walk through- to movie theaters, restaurants, exhibits etc- but not loiter.  So that is an additional challenge.  We are brainstorming on ways to get a large group in without drawing attention to ourselves.  Maybe in small groups- Maybe have a scout go first.  We are going to leave those ones for later.  <br/>
<br/>
Regarding the Las Vegas Zoo- it really is quite shameful for the size of our city.  We have never been there when there have been more than 8 other patrons.  It is small, and they have cages rather than habitats.  Lots of good hiding places- and most maintenance is done by volunteers.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to get feedback on one of the suggestions by the group when we were talking about "series" stamps.  We were thinking of placing 4 in a wetlands park/bird sanctuary.  The discussion was if we could have one large stamp (like 4inches square) of a bird- then cut that stamp into 4 one inch squares that are hidden in different letterboxes in the same park.  So if someone were to find all 4, they could make a larger picture in their journal.  (Does this  make sense?  For example: the entire image would be of a bird, but each piece would have a different area; like the head, wing, feet etc. )  I think if we included an instruction sheet saying the completed image will be so big, and this stamp goes in the bottom right corner......  Hopefully, that way the finder would start stamping in an area of their journal that would fit.<br/>
<br/>
Geesh-  I am getting long winded-  I have a few more ideas but will wait until I get some experience.<br/>

I love series like that (multiple stamps to make one image). We have a number <br/>
of them here in New England.<br/>
<br/>
CSCM and I placed a series like that called the Rhode Island Compass mystery. <br/>
Check out the clues. We made sure to have a disclaimer about leaving enough <br/>
space to stamp all the stamps. We also made sure we stamped the piece of the <br/>
picture in the "right place" in the logbook (eg. a blank square in the shape of <br/>
the final picture with the box's stamp stamped into the correct spot) so that <br/>
people would be able to see what the final position of the stamp should be <br/>
when the picture was complete. I'm not sure I described that well.<br/>

Here is one that will not be a problem if you mob it. Go to Arizona <br/>
map and locate "Shotgun Shorty". This will require about a 1 hour <br/>
drive to the Virgin River just north of Mesquite. You can bring as <br/>
many folks to this letterbox as you want and you will not disturb <br/>
the environment. You won't need to be that stealthy and my guess is <br/>
that there is ample room in the log book, in fact you may be the <br/>

I'd just like to point out one of my very neglected boxes not far <br/>
from Las Vegas.  I think a lot of people overlook the box, because <br/>
it's technically in Arizona, just over the Hoover Dam, but the <br/>
closest major city is actually Las Vegas, and is closer to Las Vegas <br/>
than even my relatively well-visited Petroglyph Series.<br/>
<br/>
So be if you ever find yourself heading out in that direction (or <br/>
even towards the California border, which isn't very far away <br/>
either), be sure to check out those border states!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, that series I hid near Hoover Dam is at a popular hot <br/>
string where lots of naked people tend to run around, so you might <br/>
not want to bring children.  ;o)<br/>

The hot springs are about four miles downstream of Hoover Dam and <br/>
several miles from the nearest road, so I don't think they watch <br/>
people too closely there.  There is a security checkpoint you have to <br/>
cross to drive over Hoover Dam, but they've just waved me through <br/>
without so much as asking a question.  (I haven't passed a security <br/>
checkpoint on my return drive, although I'm not sure if that's <br/>
because there isn't one or if the checkpoint for cars coming from <br/>
Arizona is further down the road than the trailhead.)<br/>

to LasVegas and Reno, Nevada and then home to Washington in 10 days! <br/>
We were in St.Louis, Yuma and Reno for two days and had plenty of <br/>
boxing ops. just pass us by..but then we were literally "clueless". <br/>
Are there boxes planted at Mt.Rushmore, St.Louis Peace Arch,Lake <br/>
Havasu or Virginia City?? Those were the "tourist traps" we did stop <br/>
at...we said to heck with "Wall Drug", 1880 Town and the Corn Palace, <br/>

There is a security checkpoint coming from the Arizona side but it is <br/>
a ways down the road from the dam. We came through it this past <br/>
summer...if memory serves me right it is like 5 or miles "south" of <br/>
the dam itself. <br/>
<br/>
I'm now kicking myself for not getting into letterboxing when I first <br/>
heard about it because my dad and I could of had a blast hunting down <br/>
local boxes on our whirlwind trip to Missouri and Arizona this year. <br/>
We drove from Washington State to St.Louis, Missouri to Yuma, Arizona <br/>
to LasVegas and Reno, Nevada and then home to Washington in 10 days! <br/>
We were in St.Louis, Yuma and Reno for two days and had plenty of <br/>
boxing ops. just pass us by..but then we were literally "clueless". <br/>
Are there boxes planted at Mt.Rushmore, St.Louis Peace Arch,Lake <br/>
Havasu or Virginia City?? Those were the "tourist traps" we did stop <br/>
at...we said to heck with "Wall Drug", 1880 Town and the Corn Palace, <br/>
and the Meramac Caverns (dad grew up playing in them). Hmm...I wonder <br/>
if anyone has considered a Route 66 series!! That would be cool!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(I haven't passed a security <br/>
&gt; checkpoint on my return drive, although I'm not sure if that's <br/>
&gt; because there isn't one or if the checkpoint for cars coming from <br/>
&gt; Arizona is further down the road than the trailhead.)<br/>
