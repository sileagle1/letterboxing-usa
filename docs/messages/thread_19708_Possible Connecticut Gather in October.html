                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All, We are considering hosting a Gather October 9th to <br/>
Launch "The Four Directions" tribal series. This gather would be held <br/>
in the Northwest corner of Ct. We realize this falls the weekend <br/>
after the greatly anticipated "Monster Mash" gather in Mansfield <br/>
(which we will be attending!). We also recognize other gathers are <br/>
planned. Is there interest in a Gather at that time? There is a very <br/>
large number of boxes in the area and the series will have in excess <br/>
of 22 boxes ( this series will not be able to be completed in one <br/>
day). No firm plans are made, and I will post an announcement if the <br/>
Gather is going to happpen. I bid you all safe trails.<br/>
