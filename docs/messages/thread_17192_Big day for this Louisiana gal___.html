<br/>
Finally had my first find today - thanks to a CT lady who traveled <br/>
all the way to LA to plant a box this fall.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow I'll plant my first box.  I thought the carving would be <br/>
the big challenge, but finding a good hiding spot in a city and <br/>
writing clues turns out to be way harder!  Why didn't you guys tell <br/>
me?!? <grin><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be in Oakland (CA) for Christmas and hope to get away from non-<br/>
boxing family for at least a bit in order to find a couple of boxes <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
To those lucky folks in the northeast, who have lots of boxes, - <br/>
stay safe and warm!<br/>

Tigers!!  Sugar Bowl, here we come!)<br/>
<br/>
I placed my box today and posted the clues on the LBNA site this <br/>
afternoon.  Please let me know what you think.  I have a couple more <br/>
to place as soon as I can scout the sites and write some clues.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any around here that aren't listed on the LBNA site?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great clues!  I like the purist type clues that make you think or <br/>
that tell a story; not too hard or long though.  I think I know where <br/>
the Old One is but I'm going to wait till you plant some more.  I <br/>
want to make it worth my drive.  No pressure but hurry up.:0)  In the <br/>
time being I'm going to work on one or two to hide in B.R.  I'm not <br/>
sure if you know,James Dillon, but he's a member of LBNA and lives in <br/>
Talisheke (N of Slidell).  He has a few boxes out there, one close to <br/>
you in Jackson,LA called Old Hickory.  He also posted that he'd like <br/>
to plan a get together it helps sucker others into boxing.  He also <br/>
is trying to get an order in for Walking Staff Medalions incase you <br/>
were interested.<br/>
