&gt; The first-ever letterbox in Wrangell, Alaska, was planted on<br/>
&gt; September <br/>
&gt; 12, 2002, by M. Gainey. Wrangell is in Wrangell-Petersburg county.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This box was planted on Petroglyph Beach. It does not contain a <br/>
&gt; pencil. Because this box is an orphan, after you stamp in, could you <br/>
&gt; please send me a note about its condition at mlgainey@y...? <br/>
&gt; Thanks and happy trails!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Walk down the ramp to Petroglyph Beach.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you come at high tide, less of the beach will be exposed (and <br/>
thus <br/>
&gt; virtually none of the petroglyphs), but you might still be able to <br/>
&gt; stamp in to the box. But it's really best to come at low tide. Check <br/>
&gt; the tidal tables at this link on the Wrangell Chamber of Commerce <br/>
Web <br/>
&gt; site:<br/>

&gt; an,+AK<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the spot on the beach that lines up with the red and white <br/>
&gt; diamond marker in the water, walk 60 paces to your left away from <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; ramp. The 60 paces may not be a straight shot unfortunately;<br/>
&gt; depending <br/>
&gt; on how close to the water you are when you start your paces, you may <br/>
&gt; have to step over rocks and logs along the way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The box is hidden underneath a rusty sheet of metal surrounded by <br/>
&gt; several logs. One of the logs around the box, unlike most of the<br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; logs on Petroglyph Beach, still has some of its root system <br/>
attached.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The box is attached to a stringer so that it won't float away during <br/>
&gt; an unusually high tide. Make sure you place the box back in the <br/>
&gt; plastic bag with no holes and that you completely seal it. Then make <br/>
&gt; sure that you put the entire package in the plastic bag that the <br/>
&gt; stringer is attached to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Make sure the package is placed far enough back under the metal <br/>
piece <br/>
&gt; so that it is completely hidden from view. And kick some sand over<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; stringer so that it will be hidden, too.<br/>
