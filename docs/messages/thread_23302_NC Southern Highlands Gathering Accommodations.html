                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have fixed up a spreadsheet with camping, motel, cabin, and B&amp;B accommodations in or around the Burnsville area for those of you planning to come to the First Annual (we hope) Southern Highlands Gathering in Burnsville NC June 24 and 25.<br/>
<br/>
  Please pmail me off-list if you want me to send you the spreadsheet.  I will be updating it as owners call me back, but there's a good bunch of them on there now.<br/>
<br/>
  I am trying to include distances (in miles) from the Blue Ridge Parkway, Burnsville, and Asheville.<br/>
<br/>
  If there is anything else you would like to know, please ask me.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
