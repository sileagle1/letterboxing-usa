                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to say that unfortunately it is not the first letterbox logbook retired in the US. Elaine and Jerry's Bluff Letterbox in Groton, CT has gone through four logbooks tucked away inside an old Nalgene bottle. The box is currently under relocation at this time as the area it was in had been trampled due to "over-boxing". I just wanted to make sure that we were being good stewards of the outdoors.<br/>
