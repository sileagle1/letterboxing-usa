<div>When I read about the letterbox incident in Davis, 
I began to think about places that we can't put letterboxes (e.g. National 
Parks, some private properties, etc.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have a few virtual letterboxes that are done 
using the Internet.  I am working on a concept idea for a sort of hybrid 
between a physical box and the virtual box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The idea is to lay out clues exactly as if the 
letterboxer were going to find a physical box.  Instead of finding a box, 
the letterboxer will have to find some information that can only be found if he 
or she actually went to the site.  Examples of this information would be: 
What does it say on a certain sign, what color is some object at the location, 
describe an object, etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When this information is found, the owner of the 
box would be e-mailed with the information and would provide a stamped image 
that represents the site found.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That is the basic concept.  There are some 
points that I am kind of fuzzy on and wanted to ask the opinion of the letterbox 
experts here.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In terms of verification, I was thinking of either 
a strictly written verification (i.e. an e-mail describing the requested info) 
or photo verification.  The photo verification would be absolute proof that 
the site had been visited but I'm sure that the honor system would work with all 
of you fine people.  : )  The photo verification has a negative aspect 
in that people who have non-digital cameras would have to develop their film 
before sending in the verification.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The second area I wanted to ask about was the 
stamped image.  I had two basic ideas for this.  The first is to have 
a downloadable image of the stamp online.  The link would be provided by 
the box's owner upon verification that the site had been reached.  The 
second option is to have the image stamped on a piece of paper and snail-mailed 
to the box finder.  The letterboxer could then paste the image directly 
into his or her journal.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was also tinkering with the idea of virtual log 
book.  I was thinking that perhaps a Yahoo! Group that would not be listed 
or with closed access.  When someone finds the box, the owner will (along 
with the stamp image) provide a link or access to the group.  That way it 
would be much like a real letterbox in that only those who find it can see who's 
been there.  In addition, the Yahoo! Group will allow finders to upload an 
image of their stamp.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Good idea? Bad idea?  Has this been done 
before and found to not work?  Anything I should change or scrap?  
Anything I should add?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I welcome any feedback you have on this, positive 
or constructive.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd rather spend my efforts looking for a real letterbox.  As for <br/>
hiding them goes, I'd prefer spending my efforts there hiding them in <br/>
locations where you are allowed to put letterboxes--or at least <br/>
nobody has told us not to!  There's certainly plenty of areas for <br/>
hiding letterboxes, and I don't think we've hit rock bottom in <br/>
finding new places to locate them.<br/>
<br/>
But if you must force people into beautiful areas such as national <br/>
parks to 'find' letterboxes, there are still other alternatives--some <br/>
are even legal!  =)<br/>
<br/>
But, first, while I'm not trying to encourage such practice, it's a <br/>
fact that many people--when they want to hide a letterbox where they <br/>
aren't allowed to--will turn it into a mystery box so it's location <br/>
isn't so obvious.  Or they might not post it to the talk list at all <br/>
and keep it a "word-of-mouth" kind of clue to make the clue more <br/>
difficult to aquire.  A well-hidden letterbox isn't going to be <br/>
discovered by accident, and the only way the property owner or <br/>
authorities will know about it is if you plaster the clue for the <br/>
world to see.<br/>
<br/>
There are also more ethical ways of 'hiding' letterboxes where you <br/>
shouldn't.  My 'Where's Jack?' and 'Run for the Border' letterboxes <br/>
are great examples.  In the first, I have people running into three <br/>
different Jack In the Box restaurants counting tables, chairs, <br/>
ceiling tiles, etc. which, when you use it to fill in the blanks of <br/>
the clue, leads to a letterbox that isn't located in any of those <br/>
locations.  But I still make people GO to those locations if they <br/>
want the letterbox.  The 'Run for the Border' is a similar deal where <br/>
I have people running around to three different Taco Bells counting <br/>
whatever fits my fancy which ultimately leads to a letterbox that's <br/>
not at any of those locations.<br/>
<br/>
So if you want to hide a 'Yosemite' letterbox, make people count the <br/>
number of trees in a certain area.  Or take certain letters from a <br/>
sign in the part which ultimately leads to a real, hidden letterbox <br/>
just outside of the national park.  <br/>
<br/>
And finally, there are some places where you'd LOVE to hide a <br/>
letterbox, but you think there's nowhere to 'hide' it.  You'd be <br/>
surprised at some of the clever boxes out there hiding letterboxes <br/>
where you'd never imagine it was possible!  There are boxes using <br/>
velcro, magnets, pulley systems, camaflauge, and fake rocks.  Some <br/>
boxes have strings attached to them with a stick tied to the string <br/>
so the box can be hidden in otherwise inaccesible crags yet looks <br/>
totally natural.  And with the advent of micro-boxes, it's possible <br/>
to hide full-fleged letterboxes where it was never possible before.  <br/>
(I'm still pretty proud of the letterbox I hid in a bookstore without <br/>
telling anyone that worked there!)<br/>
<br/>
Rather than hide a virtual-but-not-virtual-letterbox, I'd suggest <br/>
giving 'thinking outside the box' a try.  The creative and ingenious <br/>
hiding places people have created for their boxes is truely <br/>
staggering, and those boxes are definitely worth the effort!<br/>
<br/>
But back to national parks.  The park service generally frowns on <br/>
hiding letterboxes in the Great Outdoors.  Perhaps by talking to them <br/>
and getting a discussion with them they might be willing to hide one <br/>
behind the counter of the visitor center.  In the park and perfect <br/>
okay and legal!  =)  Or maybe you can hide a microbox in a restroom, <br/>
under a trash can, or some other publically accessible place yet not <br/>
be in the Great Outdoors.  There are lots of options--you just need <br/>
to keep an open mind!  =)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm all for coming up with new twists on the letterbox idea. If you<br/>
can figure out a way to make the semi-virtual letterbox work, go for it.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have a love-hate relationship with the computer I use every<br/>
day at work and with the "virtual" world of the internet. One reason I<br/>
like letterboxing is that it uses the internet to spread clues but<br/>
otherwise doesn't involve the computer. There are no electronic<br/>
gadgets when I'm out hunting a box, just a scrap of paper, a compass,<br/>
hiking boots and trees.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I like the "real" letterboxes and "real" logbooks where<br/>
you can see the personal stamps and handwriting of other visitors<br/>
instead of just the bare bones of posts on a message board.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I like the idea of a letterbox that maintains itself. I don't<br/>
need to respond to emails about it, or do much of anything to it<br/>
unless I happen to be in the area and want to check on it to see who's<br/>
visited.<br/>

And Taco Bell, of all places, Ryan! I know, nobody SAID you had to <br/>
eat there. Still...*grin* We are still working on that one. My <br/>
daughter says that one of the TB (interesting abbreviation) employees <br/>
knows "kinda where the box is." Right.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; just outside of the national park.  <br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about one out at Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant but <br/>
thought that 1) very few letterboxers would have access, and 2) I <br/>
might get shot by a very jumpy security force if it looked as though <br/>
I were planting anything suspicious. It is a lovely place but not <br/>
worth it. Now something out at the Energy Information Center is <br/>
doable...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; There are boxes using <br/>
&gt; velcro, magnets, pulley systems, camaflauge, and fake rocks.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas! I am seriously thinking about molding some fake <br/>
rocks now out of Fimo.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (I'm still pretty proud of the letterbox I hid in a bookstore <br/>
without <br/>
&gt; telling anyone that worked there!)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and look where that got you! There are now at least six <br/>
letterboxers due to that one box. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Perhaps by talking to them <br/>
&gt; and getting a discussion with them they might be willing to hide <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; behind the counter of the visitor center.  In the park and perfect <br/>
&gt; okay and legal!  =)  Or maybe you can hide a microbox in a <br/>
restroom, <br/>
<br/>
Nope, that is where we hide the guns. Whoops, I told!<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of a series for local tattoo parlors. Afterall, in <br/>
Dartmoor you just go into the pub and ask the barman for the <br/>
letterbox. It is not too much of a stretch to do the same in tattoo <br/>
parlors.<br/>
<br/>
Also looking at doing a series for the Pismo Clams and Los Osos <br/>
Bears. These are large "statues" and are prominently displayed.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I have been having fun carving personal stamps for folks. <br/>
Designing the stamps is every bit as much of a hoot as finding some <br/>
of them. I will post some of them up in the files section. I would be <br/>
interested in seeing what others are using as personal stamps. <br/>
Please, feel free to post up there, too.<br/>

This idea has been pretty well developed in the geocaching community. <br/>
An increasing number of caches are 'virtual'.<br/>
You can check out the main geocaching site, www.geocaching.com, to <br/>
see how the idea was implemented there. Once a stash is "virtual" it <br/>
doesn't really matter whether you call it a 'box' or a 'cache' since <br/>
it's really neither. You might also check out the geocaching forums <br/>
(follow the 'discuss geocaching' link from the main page). Many <br/>
people have set up ways to verify virtual finds using web-based <br/>
submittals or email auto-responders. Your problem may have already <br/>
been solved by someone. It would be pretty easy to have a stamp image <br/>
(.gif or .jpg file) attached as part of a reply email. You'd only <br/>
need to find someone who's set up a virtual cache responder.<br/>

letterboxing community for a bit and just now saw your post. I've <br/>
been thinking along the same lines for a couple weeks. I've actually <br/>
started a web site to do it, and was coming back to see if anyone was <br/>
interested in joining me! I did a search on 'virtual' and saw your <br/>
email. Have you done anymore thinking about it? <br/>
<br/>
    The reason I'm doing this is I no longer feel comfortable hiding <br/>
man-made objects in natural places. According to letterboxing.org <br/>
there are 4648 boxes. According to geocaching.com there are almost <br/>
48,000! That to me is just too much. I know of many that have been <br/>
washed away in floods. They're no longer letterboxes, they're litter. <br/>
I'm not accusing anybody. I love the game myself and the physical <br/>
find and the thrill of seeing what someone's carved! <br/>
<br/>
    My plan is for creator of an "EcoScavenge" to provide a "Trading <br/>
Card" for the location with some basic info. The finder gets access <br/>
to the trading card with a password based on what they find. They can <br/>
print it off and put it in a binder or scrapbook. <br/>
<br/>
    I hope I haven't turned anybody off, but on! I'm not a marketer <br/>
but someone passionate about my beliefs. I still have letterboxes out <br/>
there myself. One day I might remove them but for now they are <br/>
staying. <br/>
<br/>
    If you or anyone else reading this is interested send mail to me <br/>
at karen@paperdance.com. I'll be starting a Y! Group soon for it and <br/>
will keep you informed of updates.<br/>

Does Kinko's type places offer a "scan to disk" type service or would<br/>
participants all need scanners? Or would it be images already available on<br/>
the net?<br/>
<br/>
A drawback I see though is... no chance exchanges with other 'boxers' (no<br/>
tell tale ink on their fingers :-).<br/>
<br/>
Or is this going to be something totally unrelated to letterboxing, but<br/>
similar, like geocaching?<br/>

&gt; email. Have you done anymore thinking about it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     The reason I'm doing this is I no longer feel comfortable hiding<br/>
&gt; man-made objects in natural places. According to letterboxing.org<br/>
&gt; there are 4648 boxes. According to geocaching.com there are almost<br/>
&gt; 48,000! That to me is just too much. I know of many that have been<br/>
&gt; washed away in floods. They're no longer letterboxes, they're litter.<br/>
&gt; I'm not accusing anybody. I love the game myself and the physical<br/>
&gt; find and the thrill of seeing what someone's carved!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     My plan is for creator of an "EcoScavenge" to provide a "Trading<br/>
&gt; Card" for the location with some basic info. The finder gets access<br/>
&gt; to the trading card with a password based on what they find. They can<br/>
&gt; print it off and put it in a binder or scrapbook.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I hope I haven't turned anybody off, but on! I'm not a marketer<br/>
&gt; but someone passionate about my beliefs. I still have letterboxes out<br/>
&gt; there myself. One day I might remove them but for now they are<br/>
&gt; staying.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     If you or anyone else reading this is interested send mail to me<br/>
&gt; at karen@paperdance.com. I'll be starting a Y! Group soon for it and<br/>
&gt; will keep you informed of updates.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
