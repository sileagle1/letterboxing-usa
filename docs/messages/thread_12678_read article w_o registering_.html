Can you imagine explaining that one had you gotten pulled over or in <br/>

kids call me psychomommy!<br/>
  The police saw me drive off dressed in the gown and they had a <br/>
report. So I never thought about getting stopped. All I could think <br/>
of was how stupid of me to get that stuck! :-)<br/>
