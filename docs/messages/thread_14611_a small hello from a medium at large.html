Welcome to the addictive fun of boxing! Unfortunately you just missed a gathering in N. Virginia, and I don't know of any coming up. Alas, I didn't make it to that gathering either and I too am fairly new to this hobby so I have yet to meet any fellow boxers.<br/>
http://letterboxing.org/   is the best site for finding boxes and there are plenty in the DC/MD area. Although alot of DC boxes are coming up missing. I'm in the Silver Spring area and I prefer the wilder hunts to the north, hope to see you on the trails.<br/>
