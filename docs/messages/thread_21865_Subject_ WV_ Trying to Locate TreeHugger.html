Yes, I had been away a few days and it was waiting for me at the post office<br/>
when I returned.  I'll get my story typed and send it out DC today.  Sorry<br/>
not to answer your emails on AtlasQuest sooner, but I usually only log on to<br/>
record a find.  My story wasn't in your book, yet, so I did have to enter<br/>
it. Sorry for the hold up, I'm usually more prompt.<br/>

TreeHugger... delivery confirmation says that you received the Box Rescuer<br/>
PLB over a week ago.  Please e-mail me to say that you've received it.  I<br/>
will send you the next address when I hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
