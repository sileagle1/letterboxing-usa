&gt; Confused! I was like that for the first couple of days. I am still<br/>
&gt; trying to figure out what DON JACKSON's C stands for(caves,<br/>
&gt; centipedes, ?). Anyhow, I sometimes like to play around. L is my own<br/>
&gt; orginal. Look at some of my last posts. It's in there for what it<br/>
&gt; stands for. Forget, I save you the time. It stands for the number of<br/>
&gt; lizards that I have walked by. Yes, I know that a google is a lot for<br/>
&gt; me. But I just love that word.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Information on bencmarks(survery markers for example)can be found at<br/>
&gt; www.geocaching.com. That is were my Mom has found information about<br/>
&gt; benchmarks.  She also freaks out when she finds a marker close to<br/>
&gt; where we are going to plant a letterbox.<br/>
