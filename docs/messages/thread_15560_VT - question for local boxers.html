                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi.  I'm planning on hiking the Long Trail in a couple of weeks, and am considering doing some boxes along the way (it depends on the weight/number of boxes ratio :) )<br/>
I was wondering if some VT boxers could contact me, and let me know what is actually along the trail, and still there.  I have noticed some boxes are on the old site, but not transfered over, and two are just gone completely (I had printed out the clues a couple of years ago)  If you could just contact me off list with any suggestions, I'd appreciate it.<br/>
