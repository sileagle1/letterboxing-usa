work nicely for this--plus they're soft enough to cut with simple <br/>
wire cutters--just sand them down after you cut them and they work <br/>
well.  Otherwise, you should be able to purchase thin sheets of <br/>
balsa wood or other types of wood sheets at hobby stores (I'm <br/>
thinking along the lines of the type you might build a hobby <br/>
airplane with) or possibly even your local hardware stores.  Can you <br/>
tell we're renovating a home right now? ;)<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there are hundreds of other things you can use to back your <br/>
stamps.  Flat sturdy plastic containers cut to size might offer a <br/>
rigid enough surface for this use, too.  I know the folks who sell <br/>
PZ Kut also sell pre-cut lucite squares for use with their product.  <br/>
That's an option, too.  No, I don't have stock in the company <br/>

hi kim<br/>
i dont know how thin the wood is on the stamps you are talking about, but just blocks of precut wood is sold at micheals and hobby lobby....also dont forget you could use the toy wood blocks from kids...not the ones with the letters on them but the ones you build 'houses' with.......you can find those sometimes at dollar stores....big lots....family dollar stores...etc also...and even garage sales.....<br/>
<br/>
hope that helps<br/>

Although we've only created our own sig stamps so far, we went to the <br/>
Home Depot lumber aisles and found plenty of small boards (about 2'-<br/>
3') for hobbies/crafts in varying thicknesses and of various types. <br/>
They are pretty cheap (maybe cheaper than pre-cut blocks from <br/>
specialty stores?).<br/>

Just a note of caution -- the acrylic blocks mentioned in dvn2rckr's post<br/>
are wonderful for *temporary* mounting of soft block carving material, but<br/>
there is some sort of chemical reaction between the acrylic and the<br/>
carving material that occurs over time and makes the carving begin to<br/>
soften and melt down.  I always take one of these acrylic blocks along<br/>
with me when letterboxing, in case a box stamp isn't mounted.  It really<br/>
helps me get a good impression in my log book (and make a good one of my<br/>
own signature in the box's log), but I wouldn't recommend long term<br/>
mounting on acrylic (or storage in the clear acrylic boxes).  For some<br/>
reason the clear plastics react with the carving material where the cloudy<br/>
(tupperware or rubbermaid style) plastics don't seem to do so.  I've been<br/>
told by people who understand chemistry a lot better than I do that it<br/>
has to do with the kinds of solvent used in manufacturing the different<br/>
kinds of plastics.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!<br/>
