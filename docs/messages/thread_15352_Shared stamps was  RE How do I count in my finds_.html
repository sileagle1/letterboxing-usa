I personally think it is nice that you shared  the stamp as it is something<br/>
you were interested in.  This is not a professional sport--you play the game<br/>
according to the rules acceptable to those who play with you.   (Pick-up<br/>
game not World series) Enjoy that stamp!  (Tho I must confess, I found the<br/>
"m" to be humourous enough that I would probably use it; I am twisted that<br/>
way)<br/>

  THink I will got with an "S" for shared - sounds much better<br/>
  than "MOOCHED" as SilentDoug put it.  Didn't know I was breaking any<br/>
  rules by getting the stamp in my book.......<br/>
