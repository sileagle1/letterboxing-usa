Next subject:  If the gatherers in PA feel like spreading the word, you can have a chance to see letterboxers in concert next Fri. evening, July 16.  Our family + group, "DayBreak" will be performing at Godfrey Daniels Coffeehouse on 4th St. Bethlehem that eve. The concert starts at 8 PM with an opening act. For rates, maps, info. etc. you could check the Godfrey's website.  So far, we don't have any letterboxing songs---we're still newbies-- but I have a feeling that will come later...we could sing some clues!  We do a rather eclectic blend, with hammered dulcimer, guitar, fiddles, cello, voices, mandolin, bodhran (Irish Drum) etc.  Originals, Celtic, British Isles, American, etc.  We do have a fun explorer song about St. Brendan that is certainly in the fun spirit of letterboxing, and our latest CD is entitled "Little Steps" --appropriate enough!  Our own website is  at  www.daybreakfolk.com .  If anyone shows up from this group, please let us know after the show; I'd love to meet you!  <br/>
