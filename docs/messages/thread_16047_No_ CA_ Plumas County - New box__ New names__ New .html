and have placed a new box, <br/>
The Canada Goose, in the Feathered Friends series.  <br/>
<br/>
A Hitchhiker, The Flying Pelican, has also been released in No. CA .<br/>
After spending time in the Chester/Lake Almanor area, he was ready to<br/>
spread his wings and do some travelling!  We'll be waiting to hear<br/>
about his trips! <br/>
<br/>
It was also our pleasure today to meet California Bear and his wife,<br/>
Liz!  They are a delightful and fun couple and we enjoyed our first<br/>
stamp exchange and first meeting with other letterboxers!<br/>
