The poor, unfortunate Baudelaire orphans have been haunting me ever since. The day <br/>
dawned sunny and bright yesterday, the perfect day for searching out the dastardly <br/>
Count Olaf. <br/>
<br/>
Alas, my efforts were thwarted, a word that here means that I took the wrong trail and <br/>
met up with murderers and a treacherous stonewall. With all the wasted time, the evil <br/>
one made good his escape. All I have to show for my efforts is his cachet in my log. <br/>
Get out there intrepid letterboxers...the poor orphans need all the help they can get. <br/>
With a heavy heart, N Wise<br/>
