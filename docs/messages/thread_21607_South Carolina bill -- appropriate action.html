                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">    I was a working journalist for 25 years before becoming a professor at<br/>
at top J-school.  Both of my occupations let me study the actions of<br/>
legislators intensely.<br/>
    I can assure you that hand-wringing, complaining that legislators "just<br/>
don't get it," and attempts to decipher the wording of the bill will only<br/>
will only speed it toward the governor's desk.  Bills like this are the<br/>
results of complaints and are legitimate attempts by legislators to protect<br/>
the public's assets.<br/>
    And remember, H3777 has 32 co-sponsors.  That is 32 powerful legislators<br/>
who believe that we are causing problems for their constituents.<br/>
    Given the high-speed nature of geocaching, its huge popularity and the<br/>
broad demographic to which it appeals, I would guess the complaints came<br/>
from that area.  With that many people, something is bound to go wrong.  I<br/>
have GPS-armed students who see that sport as a wild party game.  Also<br/>
remember that government officials have a hard time seeing the difference<br/>
between a GPS box and a metal detector.<br/>
    Letterboxing developed with a strong code of conduct -- an ethic that<br/>
prevents digging, damaging or even being seen if possible.  I'm not sure<br/>
that ethic is shared by other "finders."<br/>
    So what to do?<br/>
    1. Work HARD with the geocaching groups and other seekers to draft and<br/>
adopt a uniform code of ethics.  A few rules won't hurt us and could even<br/>
cut down on the conflict between groups.  Get something on each group's list<br/>
by April 1.<br/>
    2. Document the problem.  Find out how many -- if any -- reports have<br/>
come to park superintendents and grounds keepers of problems caused by our<br/>
hobby.  We are our own best police, so it would make sense to have a "report<br/>
violations" area on the Web site.<br/>
    3.  Discuss OUR problem with the bill.  The latest version of H3777 very<br/>
clearly defines both letterboxing and geocaching and says we should keep our<br/>
boxes away from legally defined cemeteries, archeological sites and historic<br/>
sites.  Is that so bad?  Maybe we SHOULD honor certain sites as "box-free."<br/>
Or better yet, maybe we should work WITH the superintendents in those areas<br/>
and only place with permission. (Think about the "passport" stamp books the<br/>
National Park Service uses to encourage tourism).<br/>
    4.  Document the advantages.  Has anyone calculated how many<br/>
letterboxers and geocachers are out their contributing to the tourist<br/>
economy?  How many of us have enjoyed a park or a historic area that we<br/>
would never have discovered except via boxing?<br/>
    5.  WRITE.  If you don't write to both the South Carolina legislature<br/>
and to your own legislator, this and similar bills will quickly become law.<br/>
Be polite and be brief, something like:  "I am a letterboxer.  I never dig<br/>
or damage while searching, as that is against our ethics.  The real treasure<br/>
of letterboxing is the quiet enjoyment of the public lands we "discover"<br/>
through our hobby.  Please help us save this important part of the tourist<br/>
economy."<br/>
    Write or e-mail all 32 legislators individually, then contact your own<br/>
legislators.<br/>

When we were in Dartmoor with the Baker's Dozen, Godfrey Swinscow told our group that the 25 years ago, as this hobby increased in numbers, public officials of the Dartmoor National Park Service told him to have all but 2 of the original Dartmoor letterboxes removed due to undue stress on the ecosystem of the land and environs.<br/>
<br/>
That forced them to adopt the Dartmoor Code of Ethics which was instrumental in the park service allowing letterboxing to continue in Dartmoor. This code can be viewed on our website.<br/>
<br/>
I have lobbied on several occasions for a national effort to write our legislators, the National Park Service and others and to adopt our own national code of ethics but this has fallen on deaf ears since many feel it's a done deal and the powers that be will never change their minds or that this is a hobby without rules.<br/>
<br/>
What else would you suggest - laying back and allowing state-by-state to outlaw this beloved diversion of ours? <br/>
<br/>
IMHO, there is nothing worse than apathy to kill off a wonderful hobby. I believe that NOW is the time to organize, plan and adopt a national code of ethics that all letterboxers would be asked to follow.<br/>
<br/>
In closing, I ask one question: How would your lives be affected without this hobby???<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there and box!!! [and save letterboxing!]<br/>

<br/>
The ethic is shared by geocachers as well. If anything, moreso--<br/>
geocachers are not *permitted* to place a cache in an area where they<br/>
cannot keep a watch on it-- the geocaching.com site will not approve<br/>
it. Geocachers are not permitted to place a cache in an archaeological<br/>
site-- period. Geocachers are not permitted to place a cache which<br/>
requires digging, and all geocachers are supposed to be discreet and<br/>
avoid "muggles." Geocachers are also supposed to get permission before<br/>
placing a box, though they don't always. They *do* always remove a box<br/>
if there's a problem with the site. Essentially, geocache placement<br/>
rules and enforcement help prevent a lot of the issues raised in the<br/>
bill. However, there's no enforcement against bad behavior of seekers,<br/>
it's true-- but that's also true of letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
I think you hit on it, though-- with that many people, something is<br/>
bound to go wrong. Geocaching has a code of ethics for both seekers<br/>
and placers that not everyone bothers to follow. As is the case with<br/>
letterbox logs that have been filled with mean-spirited or offensive<br/>
remarks by the few bad apples, geocaching has its fair share of bad<br/>
apples as well. There's a percentage of the population who just<br/>
doesn't play well with anybody, and that percentage appears in<br/>
geocaching as much as it does elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think instead of eliminating geocaching/letterboxing in<br/>
places like cemetaries (historical cemetaries are a great place for<br/>
caches and boxes), we can find a way to work with land mangement<br/>
agencies to help them understand what it all is (for instance, that<br/>
these boxes are not on archaeological land anyway) and since the<br/>
people defacing these sites are not responsible geocachers or<br/>
letterboxers, outlawing the sport will not remove the amount of<br/>
defacement. Instead, enforcing existing laws against tampering with<br/>
headstones and archaelogical sites, basically enforcing laws against<br/>
behavior that is actually *harmful*, would be in the state's best<br/>
interest as well as be a more sensible precedent.<br/>

I for one rather like the idea of a national and official code of<br/>
ethics that works with land management agencies.  It is possible that<br/>
I'm in a minority here, but I hope this is not the case.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this: given the immensity of such an undertaking, who<br/>
would spearhead it?  Would the entire letterboxing community be asked<br/>
to approve of it?  I'm not trying to downplay the importance of this<br/>
idea, because I think it has the potential to strengthen the sport. <br/>
As much as I enjoy the clandestine feel of letterboxing, I think that<br/>
if the sport is in danger of regulation, we as a community should take<br/>
the reins.  But, it's a huge undertaking--is this something that you<br/>
(or anyone you know) has the time and energy to spearhead?  Or is it<br/>
really easier than I'm making it out to be?<br/>

Get a representative group of maybe a dozen letterboxers, including new and veterans, west and east coast, north and south, to come up with 4 or 5 items - similar to the Dartmoor Code of Ethics.<br/>
<br/>
Post them on the LBNA as a poll [or a Poll of the Week :-) ] and allow everyone the right to approve or disapprove. Majority wins.<br/>
<br/>
Then, this same group sits down and composes letters for local legislatures, National Park Service, etc including these new guidelines. Include facts and figures as to number of letterboxers, their respect for nature/ecosystem, leave no trace, revenue dollars in park passes/entrance fees, etc. Maybe meet with a NPS official for a face-to-face. <br/>
<br/>
While this may not work, I would imagine the impact of this correspondance representing letterboxers everywhere as a group might have a profound effect. And again, it may not - but why not try.<br/>

The NPS does not want you to go off the trail. Your state or local<br/>
government probably does not want you to go off the trail. Think about<br/>
it. Insurance, liability, lawsuits. Does anyone believe that the NPS<br/>
or any other govermental agencies federal,state, or local would ever<br/>
sanction or encourage letterboxing or geocaching? Why would they? Our<br/>
society is too litiginous for that. Why would we as a 'community'<br/>
choose to bring letterboxing to their attention? Profound effect<br/>
indeed. Fines.<br/>
<br/>
One could argue that a letterbox or geocache could constitute litter.<br/>
As a group 'we' cannot even tout a "leave no trace" ethic! I just have<br/>
a hard time believing any agency allowing this hobby/sport/obseesion.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents.<br/>
<br/>
ps. maybe stop writing articles in your local weekly newspapers<br/>

<br/>
The national parks service condones geocaching everywhere except<br/>
Wilderness areas (don't know about letterboxing). They don't care that<br/>
much about liability-- anything you do on National Parks land is your<br/>
own liability, because it's public land. Just as you don't sue the<br/>
city for having a beach where someone drowned, you can't sue the<br/>
government for having a national park. They don't have a legal<br/>
liability for Jeep drivers who injure themselves or their vehicles<br/>
while Jeeping in National Forests. Many state park services have<br/>
adopted a policy of allowing responsible geocaching and letterboxing.<br/>
Some park services do so on a permit-only basis, but they still permit<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; One could argue that a letterbox or geocache could constitute litter.<br/>
<br/>
"Litter" is defined as something that's been abandoned. If someone is<br/>
actively maintaining the box, then it's not abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As a group 'we' cannot even tout a "leave no trace" ethic! <br/>
<br/>
I think that the main problem I see in letterboxing is that, while the<br/>
philosophy of "everyone do their own thing" is good to a point, it<br/>
means that when someone's "own thing" is disrespectful of the<br/>
environment or of other people, there's no consequence and the actions<br/>
seem to be condoned by the letterboxing community.  As a result, we<br/>
have many letterboxers, like yourself, who want as little public<br/>
understanding of what the sport is, because you feel attention drawn<br/>
to it is bad for the game. And then we have others who feel that the<br/>
game is growing anyway, and it's already going to get bad press from<br/>
those who are disrespectful, so it may be good to do some pre-emptive<br/>
damage control.<br/>
<br/>
I don't really know the answer, here. In this circumstance, where<br/>
legislators want to ban these sports that I enjoy, I wonder if<br/>
geocaching, by already regulating itself, hasn't already done half the<br/>
work that is necessary to prevent this bill from passing. After all,<br/>
geocachers can definitively say "there are no caches legitimately<br/>
placed in an archaeological site." Can letterboxers do the same? I<br/>
don't think so, because nobody says to a letterboxer "sorry, you can't<br/>
post those clues-- that's an unpermitted site."<br/>

&gt; The national parks service condones geocaching everywhere except<br/>
&gt; Wilderness areas (don't know about letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
Uhhh, no they don't.  I've gotten in trouble by the NPS for planting<br/>
boxes on their territory and it was definitely NOT wilderness areas<br/>
where I planted them.  They don't tolerate letterboxes (or geocaches)<br/>
on anywhere on their territory.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; "Litter" is defined as something that's been abandoned. If someone<br/>
&gt; is actively maintaining the box, then it's not abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
Again, the NPS does not see it that way.  If you leave a box for even<br/>
a minute, they'll consider it abandoned.  A day, a week, a month--it<br/>
doesn't matter to them.  It's abandoned property to the NPS.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to take your chances and plant boxes on NPS property, you<br/>
go ahead and tell us how your legal battle against them goes.  I fear<br/>
it won't go your way.<br/>
<br/>
I don't consider a letterbox abandoned property (well, in some<br/>
circumstances I would, but for the most part, no), but they don't care<br/>
what we think.  It's their rules and if we don't like it, there's not<br/>
a whole lot we can do about it.<br/>

&gt;Does anyone believe that the NPS<br/>
&gt; or any other govermental agencies federal,state, or local would ever<br/>
&gt; sanction or encourage letterboxing or geocaching? Why would they? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many actually do. Several state's parks systems mention geocaching<br/>
and/or letterboxing on their websites. At least one state has a list<br/>
of geocaches in their park systems on their website. Many states have<br/>
implemented permit systems for geocaches and letterboxes. The state of<br/>
Connecticut actively encourages letterboxing to the point where they<br/>
give out awards for a certain number of finds. <br/>
<br/>
There are some park systems that actually hide their own geocaches<br/>
while others encourage geocaching and letterboxing, finding them to be<br/>
an inexpensive, low impact way of bringing attention to their parks.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the code of ethics. One was developed for geocaching that<br/>
could be a good starting point for letterboxing. The geocaching code<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The CT Forestry Department placed a letterbox in each of their 30 state forests a couple of years ago to celebrate the Centennial of the state forests in CT. They continue to maintain the boxes and publish the clues on their website. This year, they are replacing (one by one) each of the boxes with a new LB hidden in a different location in each of the forests along with new clue sheets. They are an incredibly informative tool for the forestry department to introduce and educate the public to their forestry programs and forests, as well as letterboxing. It's a super program, and that's how I got my introduction to letterboxing as well as traveling to all 30 of the CT state forests and learning a lot about forestry!<br/>
