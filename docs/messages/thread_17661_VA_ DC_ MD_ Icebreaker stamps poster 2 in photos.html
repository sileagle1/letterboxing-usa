                    <div class="plaintext-content">I added the roving event stamps to the VA: DC: MD: Winter Icebreaker <br/>
poster of stamps.  I think it looks really great now with the empty <br/>
spaces filled out better.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who might want to print a copy out I will try to <br/>
replace this photo with a better quality one with less keystoning and <br/>
better light and colors.  Still working on getting the other pictures <br/>
up.  <br/>
<br/>
Notice that you can click to view the larger image and really get a <br/>
close look at the individual stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
And yes it's true, I added the other Doubtful Guests to the poster <br/>
even though they didn't attend.  Poetic license.  You may also find <br/>
other surprises, several of the previous, retired, "It's a Holiday" <br/>
stamps.<br/>
