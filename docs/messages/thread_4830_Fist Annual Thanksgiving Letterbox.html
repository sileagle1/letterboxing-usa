<div>After Ryan posted about the 1st Annual Thanksgiving Letterbox being in 
place as of March 17, my husband and I went back to Priest Point Park today to 
try again.  After we got on the correct trail, we found the correct tree 
and then the letterbox!  Yes!  Now I was hooked.  We felt so good 
about it we decided to drive to Tacoma and we found another one at the Tacoma 
Nature Center.  So I got my first two stamps in my log book today.</div>
