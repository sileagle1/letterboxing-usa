                    <html><body>I was talking with Wanda and Pete about the Cross Mills LB this past weekend and they stated that the person who placed the Quest letterboxes is not keeping up with them.  Therefore, I've made an executive decision to replace the box.  If my parents are going to the beach house this weekend, I'll have them place the box sometime this weekend.  However, they may not be going down, so just in case, don't look for it until at least the second weekend in August.
