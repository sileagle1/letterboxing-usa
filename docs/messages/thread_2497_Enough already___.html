                    <div class="plaintext-content">As someone who has NOT been around this list since the beginning of time, I <br/>
can only give that viewpoint.  Can everyone please stop the bickering?  It <br/>
seems like a few people have personal problems with each other that go way <br/>
back.  Believe it or not, everyone does NOT want to know the sordid details <br/>
of who tried to get what going in letterboxing and how the chips fell or who <br/>
wishes they were a webmaster but isn't.  And I couldn't care less if the <br/>
secret "archives" are opened or not.  (Side note: Remember when they opened <br/>
Capone's vault or whatever that was on TV and it was empty?  That was pretty <br/>
funny...)  If there is hidden "evidence" that will expose the "truth," I <br/>
suspect there is only one person, two tops, who cares at all about it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, letterboxing is a simple hobby for me and many others, and it is a <br/>
shame to see all this.  I urge you to be dignified and stop.<br/>

Carpe diem...<br/>

No don't stop. I think this all ties into the Kennedy assasination and the<br/>
recent West Coast Power crisis. It is all so simple how did you people miss<br/>
it? Don't try and ignore me. I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE TALKING ABOUT ME! The less<br/>
I see of it the more I can tell you are! YOU GUYS want the clues for<br/>
yourself. Yeah that's it. YOU GUYS are after all the clues aren't YOU GUYS ?<br/>
Thought we wouldn't find out. Yeah, those secret communications caught up<br/>
with YOU GUYS didn't it? I don't KNOW who YOU GUYS are but YOU GUYS can't<br/>
hide forever. Try and tell us there isn't a list of who YOU GUYS  are. YOU<br/>
GUYS always say there isn't a list of names be we know there always is. SO<br/>
what did YOU GUYS do with the list of names?  Another coverup? YOU GUYS kill<br/>
Kennedy pin it on Oswald and then YOU GUYS say there isn't a list of names.<br/>
Sure, no list of names. No cover up. Do YOU GUYS  really expect us to<br/>
believe that? We all know those letterboxes suck up electricity from the<br/>
air. Look at Oregon. They are sucking the electricity out of Washington and<br/>
YOU GUYS are aware of it. YOU GUYS know we are on to YOU GUYS.<br/>

AAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!<br/>
