I just wanted to let everyone know that the Trustees of <br/>
Reservations, for whom I work, has just officially <br/>
sanctioned "Questing" in their latest member newsletter!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Trustees of Reservations is a conservation organization who <br/>
preserves "areas of historic, natural and aesthetic importance for <br/>
public access and enjoyment."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The newsletter talks of the beginnings of this activity in Dartmoor <br/>
in 1854 and talks of how they hope to incorporate quests and <br/>
letterboxing in their newly forming education program.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have been gently advising my colleagues everywhere I work that <br/>
this hobby is one to embrace for its family-friendliness and its <br/>
pairing of computers with the outdoors and also with its "leave no <br/>
trace" ethic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I came to work for The Trustees, I found it to be a relatively <br/>
easy-sell, but never thought they would actually jump on the <br/>
bandwagon so enthusiastically.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will try to post the entirety of the newsletter article when I get <br/>
home<br/>

Let's hope this crack in the letterboxing door leads to full blown entry by other like-minded organizations. Nice to see our Dartmoor trip had another benefit to you!<br/>
