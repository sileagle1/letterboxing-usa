<div>Dear "DER MAD STAMPER",</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well we are finally around this weekend and able to slow down 
to put our two letterbox clues in.  We do not yet have our own webpage but 
would like to have</div>
<div>one very soon.  We are also computer neophytes and are 
learning as we go and</div>
<div>how our schedules will permit.  Any help is appreciated 
greatly by Gin and me!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It is a small world to think you lived back here in the 
midwest and know exactly the</div>
<div>site we have initially selected, Watkins Mill State 
Park.  It is were my Ginny taught</div>
<div>we the skill of rollerblading the same day I bought a 
pair.  What a place to learn!</div>
<div>It was like throwing someone in the lake and say 
"SWIM!"  It is nevertheless the</div>
<div>neatest place I have found to rollorblade.  I also know 
now where the hot catfish</div>
<div>spots are and at what time to the year they are where.  
Have you ever been to Green Lake park in northern Seattle, WA.  for biking 
etc. It is also a favorite.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ginny is a flight attendant and she gets to Portland and 
Seattle quite often.  Portland is here favorite layover.  We have 
visited the falls where your letterboxes are and we will soon return to collect 
them.  Will you be "salting" them around the</div>
<div>coast say perhaps Cape Lookout SP.  We also would like 
collect a print from the top of Mount St. Helens are at least leave one there 
for others.  Soooo, we are going through Tillamook icecream withdraws and 
must get back there asap!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will send the clues on the next msg as not to get signed out 
here.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>G and G</div>
