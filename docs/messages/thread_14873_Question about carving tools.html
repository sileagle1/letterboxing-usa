My favorite implement for carving text (or other very fine detail) is a<br/>
Testor's hobby knife.  It is similar to an xacto knife, but the blade is<br/>
thinner and more flexible.  I hold the blade at a slight angle, careful<br/>
not to undercut the text I'm cutting around and then do the same in the<br/>
other direction, creating a v shaped channel all around the text.  After<br/>
the outline is established, it's easy to go back with a gouge and clean<br/>
up.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps a little.  I've gotten to the point where I actually<br/>
enjoy carving text!<br/>

Hi!  Oh, I just found replacement nibs for the Speedball yesterday!  :)  I <br/>
live in PA, and we have a "Michael's - The Arts and Crafts Store."  Don't know <br/>
if you have a "Michael's" around you, but that's where I went (needed the <br/>
finest Speedball tips) - two per box of whichever you buy.<br/>
