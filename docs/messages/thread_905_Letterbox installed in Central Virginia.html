<br/>
DATE:  	May 19, 2000<br/>
<br/>
CLUES: Directions begin on Appalachian Trail, southern end of Nelson<br/>
County, Virginia segment.<br/>
<br/>
At junction of Fish Hatchery Trail and the AT, continue on AT towards<br/>
Maine.<br/>
<br/>
Walk 875 feet, pass through a trellis vehicle barrier and walk for<br/>
another 1454 feet to a fire pit on high level ground.  <br/>
<br/>
Leave AT Trail and take a path to the right and walk 300 ft. to a pile<br/>
of stones closest to the massive stone outcrop.<br/>
<br/>
Bear off to 230 degrees (magnetic north) from the stone pile and walk<br/>
100 feet to a rotted stump at the point where you need to begin scramble<br/>
up outcrop.<br/>
<br/>
Leave path and go past three large stone juts, all within 20 feet of<br/>
path. Look for the box tucked in a large stone cleft.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE 1:  Off-trail walking is involved. There is very steep and rocky<br/>
terrain in the area.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE 2:  Be wary of snakes and other wildlife when reaching into dark<br/>
places. No need to dig for this box. All bearings magnetic unless<br/>
otherwise noted. <br/>
<br/>
NOTE 3:  Please re-hide the thing well were you found it<br/>
