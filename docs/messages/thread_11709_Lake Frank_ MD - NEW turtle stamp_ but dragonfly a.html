                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, after hiding out from the snow and cold for so long, I finally <br/>
made the trek to the Lake Frank Turtle box to replace Squirrel's <br/>
hand-carved stamp that was discovered missing last summer.  However, <br/>
much to my surprise, there was already a store-bought turtle stamp <br/>
in the box, which someone apparently took the time to purchase and <br/>
place last August.  (The page in the logbook that mentioned this <br/>
replacement unfortunately did not have the samaritan's name.)  SO, I <br/>
went ahead and left Squirrel's new stamp and logbook, and kept the <br/>
second stamp there as well.  I did take the old logbook, however, <br/>
because it was nearly full and had suffered some heavy water <br/>
damage...Squirrel, if you get this, I'd like to mail the book to <br/>
you.  If any of you have visited this box since last summer and <br/>
either got no stamp or the first replacement, it might be worth <br/>
another trek to get a copy of Squirrel's handi-work, and if you've <br/>
never been, there's two stamps for the price of one!<br/>
<br/>
The bad news is that Lake Frank Dragonfly does appear to be <br/>
missing.  After reading a post from someone who couldn't find it, I <br/>
went back to the spot, and though the pile of rocks is still there, <br/>
no box was found.  I did go down the slope right behind the hiding <br/>
place and looked around a bit down there, although not for too <br/>
long...my 35-week-pregnant body found this whole experience more <br/>
tiresome than I had expected!  But if it did wash down the hill, it <br/>
must have gotten pretty far.  Sorry, Squirrel, and anyone who missed <br/>
out on another one of her wonderful boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>
