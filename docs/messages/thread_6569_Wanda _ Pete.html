<br/>
When I first started this letterboxing thing and got on this list, I <br/>
heard about this illustrious couple who went around and got tons of <br/>
letterboxes and all that jazz.  People had mentioned "Wanda &amp; Pete <br/>
Sightings".<br/>
<br/>
I thought they were like Bigfoot.  A myth we made up for the "perfect <br/>
letterboxers" or something.  A euphamism for something else. :) :) :)<br/>
<br/>
(Then, of course, they stamped in to my Ravenna Park box and I stood <br/>
there kind of gape-mouthed and stunned saying, "WOW....they're <br/>
REAL!".... Like finding out after all these years that Santa Claus <br/>
really DOES live at the North Pole or something. :&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
heehee!<br/>

who wants to be Wanda<br/>
when she grows up.<br/>

I just wandered down to Pt. Judith (RI) to see if anyone had stopped by my<br/>
new box, and who should I see on the very first page?  Yup, none other than<br/>
Wanda and Pete!  F1288?  1288????  It boggles the mind!  Are you guys sure<br/>
that there aren't several teams of people wandering around the country using<br/>
the same stamps pretending to be a couple named Wanda and Pete?   ;&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I'm stuck at F4, waiting for a friend to figure out why my Jeep is dead, and<br/>
if it's worth pouring more money into it.  I was getting pretty bummed out<br/>
until I saw that 8 people have stopped by my letterbox in it's first week.<br/>
Cheered me right up.  Guess I'll spend my time carving and wandering around<br/>
the neighborhood looking for new hiding places.  This part's fun too!<br/>

<br/>According to Wanda and Pete, the most letterboxes they have found in one day is 100.... that should tell you how many they find on a typical weekend!  Can you believe it?  BTW... They're up to at least 1301 at last count.  I saw a recent tally in a logbook in Mansfield last weekend :-)  I hope to get up to 500 by next summer!
