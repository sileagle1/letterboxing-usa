I have a newbie question, but I've seen your stamp around so I'm <br/>
going to ask you directly.  What's the story about this site, my <br/>
husband is getting ready to be sent over there and if it's <br/>
significant I want us to do this one too. <br/>
<br/>
thanks for the info<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure about the"God Bless America LB" but since Gwen &amp; I <br/>
started "Honor Liberty HH" I will do the honor of bringing you up to <br/>
date on her. You can find her travels on Pete &amp; Wanda's HH page. On <br/>
September 11, 2002 she was launched at Point Vicente Lighthouse near <br/>
the LA , Calif. harbor. The instructions requested that her present <br/>
location be posted so that she could move quickly across the country <br/>
visiting many letterboxes. This is contrary to how we generally <br/>
treat a hitch hiker as normally the location of a HH is kept secret. <br/>
Each letterboxer not only stamps in but is encouraged to write a few <br/>
lines concerning their feelings in her log. Now occasionally there <br/>
have been races to obtain the HH ,and other times she gets stalled <br/>
out and her journey delayed. At the end of her first year she was <br/>
mailed back to us and I posted the various comments on this chat <br/>
list that were in her log. Hopefully the same procedure will occur <br/>
after this years travels. If you would like to read the first year's <br/>
comments see message #34174, dated 10/3/03. She has been at her <br/>
current location for nearly one month, or at least no one has <br/>
reposted a new location.<br/>
