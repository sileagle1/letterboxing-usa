reading all the posts.  I found this site by reading the newboxers <br/>
site.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I checked my calendar for the SELB gathering and Aug 7th is <br/>
good.  I'll be there.<br/>
<br/>
If you need any help I'll try my best.<br/>
<br/>
I have known about LB for about a year.  Been off list for quite a <br/>
while.  I have noticed some that were active have left, some stayed <br/>
and that is nice to see.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to get some material for my 4-h group to start a project <br/>
if you know of anyone that has this please e-mail me asap.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
