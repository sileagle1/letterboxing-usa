                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am currently in my second year at Aberystwyth University, Wales, UK<br/>
studying BA Geography and I am carrying out the preparatory work and<br/>
research for my final year dissertation on letterboxing and I need YOUR<br/>
help!<br/>
<br/>
One of the main areas of my dissertation will consist of interviews<br/>
conducted with letterboxers such as you.  Hopefully, these will allow me<br/>
to gain an in depth insight into the sport and your views.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I am aware no one has ever undertaken a dissertation on this<br/>
fascinating sport and there is certainly no existing academic literature<br/>
on it (besides a number of books I have studied closely).  It is with this<br/>
in mind that I ask you to help me greatly by replying to this message.<br/>
<br/>
I am visiting New York City in late July to carry out data collection and<br/>
interviews concerning letterboxing in the US and if anyone lives near<br/>
Manhattan (NYC) or Long Island and would be happy to participate in a<br/>
simple 30-minute recorded interview on letterboxing, please contact me for<br/>
arrangements to be made, as this will be an important area of my research.<br/>
<br/>
I can assure everyone that your help will be hugely appreciated and the<br/>
success of my dissertation relies on your co-operation.  I will also<br/>
ensure that your anonymity is respected and none of the information you<br/>
supply me with will be used for further market research or passed on to<br/>
any third party.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to make the point that I am not simply someone who is<br/>
purely using letterboxing to study, I have been interested in letterboxing<br/>
at a personal level for over a year now and have found letterboxes in<br/>
Dartmoor and on the Isle of Wight.<br/>

I would be happy to help in anyway possible.<br/>
You can visit our website for some background.<br/>
I have conducted interviews of famous letterboxers in the US that are on this website.<br/>
You may use anything there but you just have to let me know what you are using.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

One more thing. I would be glad to coordinate a little gathering of some of the area premier letterboxers so that you could make a one-stop trip to a location and interview 4 or 6 of us.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if that appeals to you. We live in central CT - about 2 hours from NYC. If need be, I could get a group together and we could meet in the southern part of CT which would only be a 1 hour ride. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know how you feel about this. <br/>

<br/>
Just wanted to say a big thank you for all the help so far.  At the moment<br/>
I'm trying to work through all the emails you have sent me and reply to<br/>
them all so please bear with me...I will get back to you.  I also hope to<br/>
send out a questionnaire in the next week or so and I would really<br/>
appreciate it if as many of you as possible could fill it out for me, I<br/>
will give everyone the neccessary details when it is all ready.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your time and help<br/>
The very busy student<br/>
