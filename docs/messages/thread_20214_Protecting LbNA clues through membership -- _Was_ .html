<br/>
With no disrespect to database sites like WoL or AtlasQuest, if we <br/>
accept that the LbNA database is as close to the "official" source <br/>
of letterboxing clues that we have, then it could be password <br/>
protected.<br/>
<br/>
In order to get clues, you'll have to register as a letterboxer and <br/>
receive a username and password.  The owners of the site -- and <br/>
indeed the community at large -- would have to discuss the best way <br/>
to administer this and how to ensure that those who have access are <br/>
true letterboxers, etc. (so that this person couldn't simply <br/>
register himself).  Perhaps an annual membership fee (something <br/>
reasonable like $25 or $30) could be instituted to help with the <br/>
cost of the administration.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone care to discuss this idea farther?<br/>

&gt; We really enjoy this and are scared that it will lead to a WOM <br/>

It is good to get the discussion going..thanks for suggesting an option, but it would have prevented me (and several other people) from joining.  And maybe it is worth $25 to the yahoo in new york to find more and collect them.<br/>

There is nothing that has happened recently  that hasn't also happened in previous years when there were a lot fewer boxes (less than 100 nationwide).  Statistically, the rate of vandalism, box snatchers, inaccurate media reporting, and mean-spirited people has decreased as the past-time has evolved.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if a structured organization were to be founded the potential for liability would be so great that It is unlikely anyone would find it financially feasible to be an administrator.  This is a Volunteer organization.<br/>
<br/>
In the early days there were several personages who wished to profit from letterboxing, they are no longer with us.  However, the urge to close the corral gates will probably be with us forever.  My wisdom is that there are some things, like rivers, that are eternal and all you can do is borrow the energy but not possess the water.  Letterboxing is like that.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ultimately it is the "membership" aspect (free or not) that I was <br/>
throwing out for discussion -- although most seemed to focus on <br/>
whether to charge or not, where I was heading as a talking point was <br/>
whether acess to the LbNA database should be available to everyone <br/>
who can type in the URL or restricted to those who have an account.  <br/>
It doesn't seem like it would be hard to restrict access.  If this <br/>
action, however, wouldn't mitigate the risk of people logging on <br/>
simply to find and destroy boxes, then there's no reason to do it.  <br/>
If, however, the use of a username and password prevent guys like <br/>
the upstate NY one from getting the clues, then, well, mission <br/>
accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
The money suggestion was only an attempt to help defray the costs of <br/>
such a security system (including granting of access rights) if such <br/>
a system were deemed a good idea.  Let's forget that part for now -- <br/>
is the general consensus that access should remain open?<br/>
<br/>
For those considering using WOM clues think that such clues are, in <br/>
essence, restricted access.  Only those "in the know" would have <br/>
access and thus, IMHO, very similar to password protecting the LbNA <br/>
database.<br/>
<br/>
More thoughts?<br/>

Just a thought.  I know the issues about the downside of loss/vandalism/improper reporting are important, but look at the bigger picture.<br/>
<br/>
In the last 2 months, the number of boxes posted on LBNA site has jumped almost 1300 boxes or so--someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I seem to remember seeing it at about 9700 at the end of July.  Compared to the growth, the losses seem to be minimal.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that it impacts people on a personal level when it happens to them, but for the sport overall, this is very healthy growth.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

The answer is easier than that, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
With no disrespect to database sites like WoL or AtlasQuest, if we <br/>
accept that the LbNA database is as close to the "official" source <br/>
of letterboxing clues that we have, then it could be password <br/>
protected.<br/>
<br/>
In order to get clues, you'll have to register as a letterboxer and <br/>
receive a username and password.  The owners of the site -- and <br/>
indeed the community at large -- would have to discuss the best way <br/>
to administer this and how to ensure that those who have access are <br/>
true letterboxers, etc. (so that this person couldn't simply <br/>
register himself).  Perhaps an annual membership fee (something <br/>
reasonable like $25 or $30) could be instituted to help with the <br/>
cost of the administration.<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone care to discuss this idea farther?<br/>

I was searching for a park's name, and I'm not 100% sure how internet searches work, but if the clues were posted to a subscription-only site, that page - even with the park's name on it - probably would not have shown up during my Google search, and therefore I would have never been taken to letterboxing.org - or any website about letterboxing - in the first place.  Lucky for me the page did show up in my results, because as soon as I did find that clue page in my search I started trying to learn more about what it was talking about.  <br/>

database.  So be it. That was the point of my original post, after <br/>
all, to faciliate discussion and attempt to deal with the problem of <br/>
someone stealing letterboxes through access of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully Mr. Anti-Letterbox in NY is an aberration and not a <br/>
recurring problem we have to deal with.  I'm all for freedom, of <br/>
course, but such freedom comes with risk and cost.  Currently, our <br/>
risk is that anyone -- letterboxers and non-letterboxers -- can <br/>
access the clues and our cost is that armed with the clues non-<br/>
letterboxers may hunt the boxes simply to destroy them.  I seek only <br/>
a solution to this potential problem.  I'd prefer, of course, if <br/>
there were no problem to deal with in the first place which brings me <br/>
back to hoping that the NY incident will not become more widespread.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I'll be enjoying hunting for the letterboxes on my <br/>
list and looking forward to continued discussion regarding how to <br/>
keep our hobby safe and enjoyable from those who spite us just for <br/>
the sake of doing so.<br/>

  What????? no no no... This would not be a hole I would dig... I love <br/>
  using holes that exist... such as in my letterbox hole, a wonderful <br/>
  little mouse was living there but the family got to large for the <br/>
  hole and she did not want to deal with all the contractors and <br/>
  building permits to increase the size of the hole.  So she came to me <br/>
  after I asked what WOM ment and said " looks like you could use a <br/>
  place to dive into when you say something stupid...." I informed her <br/>
  that this was exactly the case and said hole would work fine. I <br/>
  helped her to move her and her children to a nice luxury mod. cinder <br/>
  block penthouse on the edge of the woods overlooking the corn field. <br/>
  Talk about your convenint (SP) shopping.  Anyway, after moving her in <br/>
  I proceeded to look at my e-mail which told me I was being stupid for <br/>
  not knowing what WOM ment so I jumped in and here I will hide until <br/>
  spoken to again.<br/>
<br/>
  :)<br/>
<br/>
  Did I mention I was going to do Story Letterboxes in series?<br/>

&gt;   What????? no no no... This would not be a hole I would dig... I <br/>
love <br/>
&gt;   using holes that exist... such as in my letterbox hole, a <br/>
wonderful <br/>
&gt;   little mouse was living there but the family got to large for the <br/>
&gt;   hole and she did not want to deal with all the contractors and <br/>
&gt;   building permits to increase the size of the hole.  So she came <br/>
to me <br/>
&gt;   after I asked what WOM ment and said " looks like you could use a <br/>
&gt;   place to dive into when you say something stupid...." I informed <br/>
her <br/>
&gt;   that this was exactly the case and said hole would work fine. I <br/>
&gt;   helped her to move her and her children to a nice luxury mod. <br/>
cinder <br/>
&gt;   block penthouse on the edge of the woods overlooking the corn <br/>
field. <br/>
&gt;   Talk about your convenint (SP) shopping.  Anyway, after moving <br/>
her in <br/>
&gt;   I proceeded to look at my e-mail which told me I was being stupid <br/>
for <br/>
&gt;   not knowing what WOM ment so I jumped in and here I will hide <br/>
until <br/>
&gt;   spoken to again.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with a bunch of you that having a password in order to get clues on LbNA would probably help at least somewhat in limiting access to clues by the wrong people.  It's not going to stop all box-lifting, but I can't think of anything it would hurt, except maybe those few Google searches someone mentioned.  One idea would be to try it for a year or so and see how it goes. Why not?  It could always be changed back again if it was a real bomb, right?  It's true that a few less people might stumble upon the hobby that way, but seems to me that the benefits might outweigh that.  The tiny number of people who just might not discover it because of a fairly simple limit is to me similar to the few people who might not discover the great antiques shops in my town due to a few limits on population growth.  If our town planners had wisely chosen to limit growth to something other than a tidal wave of people so that roads and safety issues could be addressed one at a time (which they haven't), we would not now be experiencing jams from one end of town to the other.  People would have still found the antiques shops in time, but the roads to get there would be a lot more enjoyable and safer.  With all the new media exposure, it seems to me people who are types who'd be interested, will find out about it no matter what. I think it's probably true that people being overly-mysterious or refusing to talk would simply intrigue most reporters even more.  That's a tough one, though.  Part of me screams, "NO-o-o --stop talking to reporters" but part of me too has to agree wholeheartedly with what Longhorn says.  I can't deny the inevitability of the exposure in this country, and then the need for damage control if we haven't helped where we could with the right emphases and the right details. --lunaryakketyact<br/>

Susan Randall Davis <davisarc@davisvermont.com> wrote:A founding principle of LbNA is that access to clues is FREE!   The concept is well expressed by the vignette of a child going to the public-access library computer and downloading a few clues for a family adventure.  When you understand that this primary principle is a GIFT to the world, then you may feel more comfortable with the flotsam that can wash up on the shore every once in a while.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing that has happened recently  that hasn't also happened in previous years when there were a lot fewer boxes (less than 100 nationwide).  Statistically, the rate of vandalism, box snatchers, inaccurate media reporting, and mean-spirited people has decreased as the past-time has evolved.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if a structured organization were to be founded the potential for liability would be so great that It is unlikely anyone would find it financially feasible to be an administrator.  This is a Volunteer organization.<br/>

In the early days there were several personages who wished to profit from letterboxing, they are no longer with us.  However, the urge to close the corral gates will probably be with us forever.  My wisdom is that there are some things, like rivers, that are eternal and all you can do is borrow the energy but not possess the water.  Letterboxing is like that.<br/>
<br/>
Just let it flow and keep on boxin'<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to chime in on the membership idea:  I doubt anyone will ever<br/>
convince everyone to agree on one way to do this.  I personally think the<br/>
benefits of freely accessible boxes outweighs the disadvantages.  However,<br/>
there is nothing to say that someone couldn't set up a site which allows<br/>
people to password protect their clues, or access clues by paying a<br/>
membership.  Or even a members only area on LbNA itself, for those who<br/>
wanted that option.  If someone wanted to do this then the people who were<br/>
more concerned with protecting the integrity and safety of their boxes would<br/>
have that option, while people who were more concerned with contributing to<br/>
a freely available collection could continue to do so also.  <br/>
<br/>
In fact, a split like that is probably what would happen anyway, if LbNA<br/>
were to become an entirely fee based / password protected website. Some<br/>
people are bound to encourage the development of the freely available<br/>
variety of database.  I think things have just gotten too far, and there<br/>
will always be some freely available clues, regardless.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying one way is better than another - they are just differences,<br/>
in a highly diverse pastime.  There is likely room for both in the sport,<br/>
just like there is room for website clues and word of mouth clues, both of<br/>
which add a lot to this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, haven't I heard that you have to find 100 boxes in Dartmoor<br/>
before you get access to the big catalog or something.  I just remember<br/>
reading something about that - forgive me if I'm wrong.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I'm just so grateful for this absolutely priceless hobby.  We<br/>
don't get out to 'box as much as I'd like, what with the munchkins and all,<br/>
but we are excited to see many more boxes popping up in our area (Charlotte,<br/>
NC) and I also feel privileged to be able to follow all the creative<br/>
discourse which occurs on this list.  It adds a whole other element to<br/>
letterboxing - community!<br/>

With the increasing number of members, it will of course increase the number of missing or damaged box. That's just the law of averages. For the most part this is just a sweet game with loving, caring, artistic and sometimes overly enthusiastic, careless people. Yes, a lot of time, energy, creativity and love went into these boxes and the thought of losing any of them is a tragedy but to stoop to this level? You don't think that someone that is determined to destroy boxes couldn't figure out how to get a password? Think about all the people how would miss out on the enjoyment of this game.  Rules, we would start to have rules. When you get to rule number 127 go back to rule number 1, NO RULES?!?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmm, I'm not sure why having a membership is "stooping".  I think when people, including myself, were speaking of membership or a password to be used for searching for LbNA clues, we were speaking of the exact kind of things we need to have in order to write emails on this talk-list!  Nothing mysterious or nasty or difficult or silly or exclusive or costly.  To get on this talk-list, we each chose an ID# and a password of our own. It wasn't exactly jumping through hoops-- what did it take, initially? 10- 20 minutes, an hour?  Yes, certainly there would be people still getting through who have no intention of doing good with the info.  There have been people on this list with bad intentions, too.  But having to take a little time initially to set up something surely is at least a bit of a deterrent to the casual drop-in who heard about it on the evening news and just wants to go nab boxes. C'mon, there are little hurdles all over the place in our society to help protect that which we care about. No, we don't need to put glass shards in a high wall, but what about a couple logs to step over?  To enjoy this game anyway, people have to be a bit more tenacious than that. <br/>
<br/>
As I already said, would it really be that threatening to try something different for a bit?  We can always go back to the way things were if necessary.  When the status quo isn't working great, why not tweak it a bit?  I'm not even someone who's been all that personally affected by the missing boxes, but I sure hear a whole lot of you being very affected; how many times a day recently do we hear about them?  And I have no grand illusions that we can "fix" the problem by trying this one thing, but I sure would like to see people working together to try something rather than just throwing our hands up and saying we can't do anything besides hide boxes well.  It just looks to me like things have already evolved a lot in this game, and will need to continue evolving to be at optimum health for the future. Making decisions about certain changes is not equal to creating rules.  I'm trying to think of all the people who "might miss out on the enjoyment of this game" and I can't think of anyone who would have to miss out, unless they simply don't feel like taking a few minutes of their life to create a password.  In that case I can't worry myself about them.  I choose to think instead of the hundreds of people who have placed boxes for all to enjoy and who might possibly have slightly better odds of keeping them intact for awhile if we could put a small hurdle or two in place.  If it doesn't help at all, then we can go back to the drawing board.  Change is not always scary, bad, or irreversible.  Think about it, try it on... we can do better than just reacting. I've heard a lot of great ideas in this group.   --lunaryakketyact<br/>
