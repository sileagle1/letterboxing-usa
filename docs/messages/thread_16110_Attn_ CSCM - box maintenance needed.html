could explain why I hadn't gotten a response from CSCM on the<br/>
condition of his box(es) Crossways Crossed Paths in RI. We stopped by<br/>
there after the Mystery Gathering. The first box looked as if the<br/>
inkpad had somehow exploded - there was red ink all over everything<br/>
except the logbook which was safe inside its ziploc baggie. We cleaned<br/>
it up a tiny bit but didn't have much left in supplies at the time<br/>
since we had replaced pieces of several other previous letterboxes.<br/>
The second box had no inkpad at all. Just thought I would let you know.<br/>

Thanks for the heads up, and for cleaning up! I'll try to get back <br/>
down there soon to replace the ink pads.<br/>

No, we're just cruising the internet in direct voilation of our <br/>

CSCM - since this is a joint box, I feel some responsibility, too.  I <br/>
will be heading down to my summer place on Friday afternoon, and will <br/>
be driving right past this.  I'll replace the ink pads and repair the <br/>
damage.  Isn't this the weekend of the Cape Caper or something?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, your life is so busy, and I'm going to be driving right past <br/>
on Friday afternoon, I'll gladly take care of it.  Unless, of course, <br/>
you want to be obsessive about it and do it all yourself (rolls eyes).<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember the particular name of the red pigment stamp, or am I <br/>
free to get the closest match?  I have the original stamp images from <br/>
when we placed this.<br/>

p.s. to all who read this list - CZF was the handle I used before <br/>
donning the mantle of Warrior Woman.  We did this as a joint box.  <br/>
Just to clear up any confusion.<br/>

By all means, please do.  I'm not that possessive, and it sounds like <br/>
you'll be down there much sooner than I will.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yup.  Then on Sunday Kim and I will be doing some serious cleaning at <br/>
my apartment.  We've been watching too much of Trading Spaces, Queer <br/>
Eye For The Straight Guy, and While You Were Out and we're beginning <br/>
to get dangerous ideas!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do you remember the particular name of the red pigment stamp<br/>
<br/>
Red.  Any red will do.  Or feel free to be creative.  The color is <br/>
not integral to the image.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Love ya!<br/>

Possessive?  We planted that box together!!!!  Are we going to have a <br/>
custody fight over this child of ours!<br/>

It'll be fixed by 4 pm Friday afternoon.<br/>
