and Draft Dad on the last day of thier New Hampshire vacation. Please <br/>
consider this a thank - you to the planter of Seacoast 2 letterbox <br/>
and a added magical pleasure to those who come along  next.  <br/>
   Follow Aisling's clues to  the Urban Forestry Center in Rye, New <br/>
Hampshire. Follow clues to her wonderful box. We valiantly fought the <br/>
mosquitos and found our  treasure happily.  We were so happy we <br/>
decided to add to the fun! So continue on Goodwin  happy with what <br/>
you found. Pass the  ledge and woodpile.  We came to  a place where  <br/>
we needed to make a decision . We stood and pondered a moment and the <br/>
Cowboy in his usual energy bounded to the right and said " I found <br/>
it!"  Oh yes this was a suitable magical place.  Look for a rotted <br/>
stump just off the trail. Be sure no others lurk nearby in the wood. <br/>
If strangers come upon a Golden Pegasus it may just disappear forever <br/>
from our midst. Magical creatures are so special so let Peg  alight <br/>
in your journal before you tuck her back in her quiet home.  <br/>
