We found: The Minutemant Bikeway Letterbox. We hiked it from Lexington center. The box was in good shape but a little wet. The bag with the stamp is ripping and needs replacing. I would've replace it but I had run out of bags. We also found the Turtle Pond letterbox in Belmont. This is a lovely park and we're now thinking of becoming Audabon members. The pond was lovely and we had great fun watching the turtles (about 6) just sunning themselves. The pond is also teeming with fish. We also the Weeks Pond letterbox also in Belmont. This one was a bit harder as the trail is having maintainence done. We couldn't walk "straight ahead" on the last compass heading as there was a large pile of brush and sticks that had been cut. There were also several large green trash bags behind this with (we think) leaves in them. We went around the pile and found the box! We bagged the stamp pad and stamp separately as the stamp pad is leaking green ink all over the place. The pond still has ducks and frogs. It also completely covered in algae. We fed the ducks had a lovely afternoon.<br/>
