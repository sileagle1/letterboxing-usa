Windsor River Trail Letterbox in Windsor,CT has been moved to a new <br/>
location. Out of the flood zone. Please reprint for new clues.<br/>
Connecticut River Bikeway Letterbox in Springfield,MA has been <br/>
replaced after going missing.<br/>
Northampton Bike Path Letterbox in Northampton,MA has a new pad now, <br/>
in case you were unable to stamp in before.<br/>
I've added drive-by directions for both my Manhan Rail Trail Letterbox <br/>
in East Hampton,MA and Norwottuck Rail Trail Letterbox in Amhurst,MA<br/>
I regularly update my Letterboxes, so if you've printed out clues in <br/>
the past, it's a good idea to recheck them before you head out. <br/>
Especially if your biking. Happy trails!<br/>
