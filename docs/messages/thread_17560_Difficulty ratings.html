I'm developing a new Letterbox Difficulty Rating Program and I would like you input as to what you think should be included to rate the difficulty of a particular letterbox.  So far I have:<br/>
<br/>
Terrain<br/>
Accessibility<br/>
Box Difficulty (As in how well hidden)<br/>
Clue Difficulty (As in how cryptic they are written)<br/>

What else do you think needs to be considered when rating the difficulty of a letterbox?  And do you think it should be one number like a 3.8 out of a 5 rating?  or should there be a number for each field?<br/>

<br/>
Terrain: 2<br/>

Box Difficulty: 4<br/>
Clue Difficulty: 1<br/>

I think you're opening a whole can of worms that really doesn't need <br/>
to be opened.<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching has ratings, but it is a whole different animal.  While it <br/>
IS a form of what I call "Sport Treasure Hunting," it is also a <br/>
more ... Disney/AOL/gimme ... form.  (I don't know how to put it into <br/>
words, really.)<br/>
<br/>
Part of boxing's appeal to me is the fact you don't know what you're <br/>
getting into with some clues.  It's the mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I feel that ratings just won't work well in that relm.<br/>
<br/>
That's not to say a sub-form of boxing can't work.  Maybe, GPS-<br/>
less/no-trading caching, something like that.  But for boxing on a <br/>
whole, it would be tough.<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, I wouldn't want someone to APPLY a rating to a box <br/>
that I have chosen not to rate, either.<br/>
<br/>
I'm coming back to concentrate more on boxing BECAUSE of all of the <br/>
mess over at geocaching.com.<br/>

<br/>
I am *very* new to letterboxing. I meant to get started some time back, <br/>
but health problems got in the way...... Because of that, and just in <br/>
general, I'd much prefer having ratings for each field. A box with, say <br/>
a 5 for terrain and a 1 for clue difficulty is *much* different from a <br/>
box with a 1 terrain and a 5 clue difficulty. Having just one number <br/>
doesn't automatically tell someone enough to make a decision on whether <br/>
to go for the box. I might enjoy difficult clues, but be unable to <br/>
handle too much terrain difficulty. Someone else might enjoy an <br/>
extremely difficult hike, but not want to spend hours hiking somewhere <br/>
only to spend another hour or two looking for the box itself (to <br/>
exaggerate, lol.) Having separate numbers for each field would be much <br/>
more useful, imho, and I would welcome and appreciate the effort that <br/>
would go into listing such ratings.<br/>
<br/>
Unrelated question - If there is a group in the Albany, NY area, I'd <br/>
love to hear about it. I have checked out the letterboxing.org website <br/>
and there seems to be a limited number of boxes within a short/day trip <br/>
of my home. Perhaps if we get together, we can change that? :-)<br/>

<br/>
I personally think that many people like as much info as possible before starting out, especially if they have small children, health concerns, special physical limitations, or time constraints, etc.  Certainly, those who do not need this info can choose to ignore it.  It's considerate of you to spend the time and effort trying to rate the hikes. <br/>
I'm wondering if your goal is to assign a difficulty rating such as a number and leave it at that.  I wouldn't find that particularly helpful.  Although it might be nice to have something like "Difficulty: Terrain: 2 out of 5"   or    "Clue difficulty:  4 out of 10,"  you'd still probably would have to add phrases such as "moderate" or "straightforward"   And no matter what scale, you'll probably have to note which end of the scale is more difficult each and every time, or include a link to your rating page.  You may think it's apparent that a difficulty rating of 2 out of 5 is pretty easy, but some people would draw a blank here.  Honest, some would.  ;-)   So if your objective is to make it really easy for potential seekers to decide if your boxes are worth a shot under given circumstances, then give lots of info.  Say, for instance, the terrain is level and it's under a mile, it might be a 1 to you, but is this place full of exposed roots, or often soggy?  Is the path a well-maintained wheelchair accessible one, but the area laced in poison ivy and the box well off-trail or behind a stone wall? This could make a big difference if I'm taking a stroller, or small children in boots, or my mother-in-law who walks fast but will trip on a shadow.  I can't see how a rating system would help more than descriptions unless it was quite involved.  Also, are there alternate routes that impact the difficulty?  Here in RI there is an older coastal box that can be quite challenging, requiring scrambling over rocky coastline, sometimes wet and slippery, but since it was a placed a w-i-d-e swath was cut through the brush making access safe and easy on a grassy path above the coastline. It's nice to know ahead of time so I know who I can bring along and if I can get there safely after dark.<br/>
<br/>
What's important to me often is something that numbers could probably not tell... but I'd take them into consideration!  The more info, the better.  I like to print out the clues, map a plan (even if only in my head), and be "good to go."  Unless I purposely choose a cryptic or mystery box, I don't want unpleasant surprises nor do I want to do "homework";  I want to trust that I have all I really need, and my backpack and preparedness to fall back on.<br/>
<br/>
As someone else said, check out Silent Doug's rating system if you haven't already.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I've helped in some way.<br/>

If you want to mention something in the beginning of the clues about the nature of the hike (strenuous vs. easy, rocky or rough terrain, etc.) that's great.  I appreciate information like that before I go out on a trek.  But as for the difficulty of the clues or how well the box is hidden, I'd rather find that out for myself as I undertake the adventure.  If I read the clues at home and they seem confusing, I don't do that letterbox.  A well-hidden box is part of the fun for me, and gives me a greater sense of accomplishment when I do find it (a bigger "ah, ha!", if you will), but I don't need to know about that before-hand.  Let's leave some of the mystery in it!<br/>

I prefer a short description rather than numbers.  SOmething along hte lines<br/>

As far as clue difficulty, that is obvious to me (usually) by reading hte<br/>

Otherwise, I would prefer seperate numbers<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'd like to get the help of the letterboxing community<br/>
&gt; concerning something I an working on.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm developing a new Letterbox Difficulty Rating Program and<br/>
&gt; I would like you input as to what you think should be<br/>
&gt; included to rate the difficulty of a particular letterbox.<br/>
&gt; So far I have:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Terrain<br/>
&gt; Accessibility<br/>
&gt; Box Difficulty (As in how well hidden)<br/>
&gt; Clue Difficulty (As in how cryptic they are written)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What else do you think needs to be considered when rating the<br/>
&gt; difficulty of a letterbox?  And do you think it should be one<br/>
&gt; number like a 3.8 out of a 5 rating?  or should there be a<br/>
&gt; number for each field?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (For example)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Terrain: 2<br/>
&gt; Accessibility: 3<br/>
&gt; Box Difficulty: 4<br/>
&gt; Clue Difficulty: 1<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Total: 10<br/>
&gt; Overall score:  2.5<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please share your thoughts on this with me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance!<br/>

The only exceptions that might need a rating would be information the<br/>

I have small children... and long walks or difficult walks don't work<br/>
for us.  My kids get very disappointed when we get out to letterbox,<br/>
only to find out that it is too hard for them.  I would much prefer this<br/>
information in advance.  (And the dog would love it if she could come<br/>
too - but we don't take her due to the fact that we don't usually know<br/>
if it is dog friendly).<br/>

<br/>
Say, for instance, the terrain is level and it's under a mile, it might<br/>
be a 1 to you, but is this place full of exposed roots, or often soggy?<br/>
Is the path a well-maintained wheelchair accessible one, but the area<br/>
laced in poison ivy and the box well off-trail or behind a stone wall?<br/>
This could make a big difference if I'm taking a stroller, or small<br/>
children in boots, or my mother-in-law who walks fast but will trip on a<br/>
shadow.  I can't see how a rating system would help more than<br/>
descriptions unless it was quite involved.  Also, are there alternate<br/>
routes that impact the difficulty?  Here in RI there is an older coastal<br/>
box that can be quite challenging, requiring scrambling over rocky<br/>
coastline, sometimes wet and slippery, but since it was a placed a<br/>
w-i-d-e swath was cut through the brush making access safe and easy on a<br/>
grassy path above the coastline. It's nice to know ahead of time so I<br/>
know who I can bring along and if I can get there safely after dark.<br/>
<br/>
What's important to me often is something that numbers could probably<br/>
not tell... but I'd take them into consideration!  The more info, the<br/>
better.  I like to print out the clues, map a plan (even if only in my<br/>
head), and be "good to go."  Unless I purposely choose a cryptic or<br/>
mystery box, I don't want unpleasant surprises nor do I want to do<br/>
"homework";  I want to trust that I have all I really need, and my<br/>
backpack and preparedness to fall back on.<br/>

What? Are your sure? <br/>
All kidding aside, I am doing this for the fun. It gets me out for a good long walk in the fresh air. Okay, the rainy days aren't too great, but still fun.There has been only one or two times when we actually threw in the towel - the first time after a couple of miles walk on the beach we think we found the area ( we couldn't go much farther without swim gear). There was much PI and cat briar. We couldn't find the trail and we were getting very scratched up. Since the box was planted in winter and here it was summer...maybe we'll go back someday. Usually the problem is not with the directions or the location of the box, but with the environment. If a trail is not used very often, then the way does not stay obvious.<br/>
Can't wait to get out on the trailagain.<br/>

  Too differcult.  This is suppose to be fun.  If you don't get a box so what.  <br/>
  We have to learn to accept disappointments. Letterboxing is not a test or  a <br/>

<br/>
You may remember back in May when I received the Purple Heart Award <br/>
and spent 6 weeks on crutches because I broke my ankle in three <br/>
places while letterboxing.  At that time I wrote what I considered to <br/>
be a plea to the letterboxing group that someone come up with <br/>
something like a rating system and that placers take a more serious <br/>
attitude of responsibility when posting there clues to give the <br/>
letter boxer some idea of what they are getting into.  I cannot tell <br/>
you how much I appreciate you taking the incentive to do it. The way <br/>
I see it, and I am a placer as well as a seeker, I also have a <br/>
responsibility to the seeker, when they decided to look for one of my <br/>
letterboxes my clues are their guide so to speak.  I see no reason <br/>
whatsoever that I cannot assist in making sure they know how to <br/>
prepare themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Despite what the waiver of responsibility says though I understand it <br/>
and it's legalities, I know that morally I would feel terrible if <br/>
someone went out searching for one of my letterboxes and ended up <br/>
falling off a cliff or breaking something and then come to find out <br/>
that they thought they could handle it because my clues didn't give <br/>
them enought, or the correct information.<br/>
<br/>
I think a rating system is a very important thing.  I think handled <br/>
well and built well it would be a very beneficial and helpful.  I <br/>
also as many others have stated think that there can be some <br/>
confusion as to what is a "5" and what is a "2"  however, I think <br/>
that if a "Key" so to speak was also created that explained what is <br/>
considered "difficult" and what is considered "easy" then a person <br/>
reading that key can decide for themselves what level they feel suits <br/>
them.  And with a basic guideline to follow a placer then has the <br/>
choice to utilize it or not, and if utilized the letter boxer is not <br/>
left wondering what each specific placer considers difficult and <br/>
easy, but instead what the "key" does, and what they do. You have not <br/>
therefore taken the responsible decision on whether or not to attempt <br/>
to find the letterbox and the responsibility of doing so away from <br/>
the seeking letter boxer.<br/>
<br/>
Just as an example here: Lets say for a moment that I am hunting down <br/>
one of the ever-notorious Ryan Carpenter boxes.  I read Ryan's clues <br/>
VERY carefully.  If Ryan rates something "Difficult" I know I am in <br/>
for something serious and don't plan anything else that day.  But <br/>
that is because I know Ryan and have searched for his boxes several <br/>
times.  Now what I would rate "Difficult" would be very easy for Mr. <br/>
Carpenter.  When hunting down a Der Mad Stamper Box, I know to expect <br/>
more difficulty finding the box then on the hike itself. But this <br/>
comes from experience with letter boxers, we cannot depend on that, <br/>
as often times our boxes are looked for by people that have never <br/>
heard of us, and are visiting our area. <br/>
<br/>
Here is what I suggest:  A basic guideline to the rating system based <br/>
on popular contribution (Just like Steve is trying to do) where the <br/>
rating is a number, but that number has a written descriptor.  <br/>
Perhaps something like 5  Hike is over 6 miles and/or may include <br/>
high elevation gains, strenuous rock climbing or a stroll through a <br/>
field of poison ivy.  0  Hike is all flat walking, wheelchair and <br/>
stroller accessible and wonderful for small children and so on and so <br/>
forth.<br/>
<br/>
As for rating clues and the actual hiding location of the letterbox, <br/>
I do not personally feel a need for such a thing; I also find the <br/>
clues obvious from reading them and the location to be a big part of <br/>
the mystery of the hunt.  I personally don't have a problem not <br/>
finding a box, it happens, I've been known to contact the placer and <br/>
go back again a few times before giving up. However, perhaps I am <br/>
missing something other people do feel a need for, and I would have <br/>
no problem participating in that area to help others out if it is <br/>
something they need or want.  <br/>
<br/>
I will not debate that giving away difficulty details and such on <br/>
a "Mystery Box" and so on and so forth would take away the Mystery, <br/>
but I also don't think anyone that felt a need to know such details <br/>
would set out blind on a Mystery Letterbox.  I think it would suffice <br/>
to say that a "Mystery Box" would probably not be rated and that <br/>
those of us want more information before setting out are quite all <br/>
right to not get those letterboxes.  I won't get every letterbox in <br/>
the world so that one won't kill me either. <br/>
<br/>
On a personal note I will add that were Steve to develop this farther <br/>
(which I suggest and support) Iron`Bear and I will definitely rate <br/>
our boxes.  Not to mention that I think I would be more inclined not <br/>
look for boxes by people that choose not to rate theirs and aid us in <br/>
being prepared than I would be deterred by their box being rated <br/>
difficult because honestly, my safety, Iron`Bear's safety and our <br/>
daughter's safety is more important to me than any letterbox.  I <br/>
surely don't mind the idea of something being difficult, I just want <br/>
to know ahead of time so we have everything we might need if an <br/>
accident were to occur. <br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>

Take it from me.  Geocaching has a clearly defined rating system and <br/>
you STILL have caches rated strange.  A "1" terrain is supposed to be <br/>
wheelchair accessible, however, you will find some caches rated a "1" <br/>
that has you climbing hills on animal trails.  No way in heck could <br/>
you get a wheelchair up there.  Heck, I'd have a hard time CARRYING <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
So what's to say a box is mis-rated and someone still gets hurt?  The <br/>
effort is for naught.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, trying to put a rating system on anything so someone <br/>
doesn't get hurt is passing the blame.  One should ALWAYS be aware of <br/>
their surroundings and abilities.  What's to say when the box was <br/>
placed the area only needed a "2" terrain, but down the road it <br/>
jumped to a "5"?<br/>
<br/>
An analogy is driving a car.  Just because everyone is supposed to <br/>
drive safely and the roads are safe doesn't mean you can drive the <br/>
car with your eyes closed.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone should be taking responsiblity for their OWN actions.<br/>
<br/>
No, rating boxes will be a futile effort.  You will NOT get the <br/>
result you think you want.<br/>
<br/>
The best solution, if anything, is like what has been mentioned, a <br/>
short description.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with Mama Stork regarding short hints at the beginning of the clues. <br/>
We letterbox with a 12 and 3 year old, and a17month old. approximate <br/>
time,terrain, and suitability for young children are important to me. If I box alone or <br/>
with my wife I do boxes that seem more of a mystery or longer. If I do a <br/>
questionable box with the kids; I have a backup box plan that I know will be easy <br/>
so they are not dissapointed. Generally the kids don't care anyway, because <br/>
they just enjoy they adventure. The hunt should be a learning experience as well <br/>
as just plain fun, whether box found or not.<br/>
   I think it should be up to the placer to offer what ever hints/ratings <br/>
that he or she wants to or feels is appropriate. I'm not sure a concensus can be <br/>
reached to have a universal rating system, or if one is necessary. Phyto <br/>
pointed out that no ratings will be on his boxes. This intrigues me to search for <br/>
those boxes, but not with kids. Rubaduc usually has good info regarding time <br/>
and terrain; I may not do his when I have kids. You can always try contacting <br/>
the placer BEFORE you go on the look.<br/>
   Sorry for rambling, thought I would offer my view. Safe trails to all!<br/>
