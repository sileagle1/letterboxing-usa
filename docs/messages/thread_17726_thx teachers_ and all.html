                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did letterboxing with my son's Cub Scout den.   I bored everyone here with <br/>
it as it happened, so I'll try not to be too wordy here and now.   <g><br/>
<br/>
They're 5th graders, and I let them use carving tools.   We only had one kid <br/>
jab his hand--naturally it had to be the one with hemophilia!<br/>
<br/>
They cut out the wood backing and glued the rubber to it, which made the <br/>
project meet a requirement for their craftsman badge.<br/>
<br/>
I hid three boxes for our campout for them to find.   I made the clues <br/>
scout-oriented.   They had to answer questions about scouting requirements to figure <br/>
out how many paces to go, which way to turn, etc.<br/>
<br/>
There was one "real" box in the same park where we camped.   I decided to <br/>
leave it alone for security reasons.   Good choice.   As it turned out, my son, <br/>
who'd found the real one with us the week before and had been sworn to secrecy, <br/>
tried to lead one of our accompanying Boy Scouts to it.   Trouble was, he <br/>
couldn't find it!   His excuse was, we'd told him not to take any of the Cub <br/>
Scouts to the box, but he thought it was okay, since this boy wasn't a Cub Scout <br/>
anymore but had moved on to Boy Scouts!<br/>
<br/>
That first trip, we sent them out in small groups of two or three kids, with <br/>
a leader to go along and help if need be.   On our NEXT campout, we took them <br/>
to find another "real" box (too far away from home for them to go after it on <br/>
their own later on).   That time, the whole group went together, and it didn't <br/>
work nearly as well.   One kid kind of influenced them all into believing it <br/>
wasn't cool, so they all soured on it.<br/>

I just learned about letterboxing at a class taught this past weekend by<br/>
Silent Doug. I came home so excited, that I couldn't wait to tell my family<br/>
about it! My 12 year old son is a lot like me, and this intrigued him as<br/>
much as it did me. He couldn't wait to make his own stamp - he immediately<br/>
got a sketchpad out and started drawing his own. I let him use the exacto<br/>
knife that I received at the class and he did fine. I had to help him a<br/>
little with the fine details, but other than that, he did it himself. He was<br/>
thrilled!<br/>

interested to pursue it with you later.  I bet that reallyhelps weedout the<br/>

troop.  As someoen who discovered letterboxing thanks to mass media, I want<br/>
to share it with others who may bring a lot to the hobby but might not<br/>
otherwise learn of it.<br/>
<br/>
Workign it into a biblestudy/sunday school class could be fun; have clues<br/>
related to scripture quotes and biblical references.  ("Take one pace for<br/>
each hippopotomus, elephant and giraffe Noah took on the ark") or relate ti<br/>
to the theme of the camp<br/>
<br/>
My almost 7 yo is able to use the speedball tools with supervision--one<br/>
slight jab was all it took to reinforce the idea of carvign AWAY from<br/>
herself.  I would hesitate to turn a group loose with them tho.<br/>

<br/>
I was at a Girl Scout Leader Weekend in Pennsylvania, where 600 Girl Scout<br/>
Leaders congregate each year at one Hotel &amp; Conference Center for the<br/>
weekend to take workshops, laugh, goof off, and generally act like the kids<br/>
we are usually in charge of!  We have the opportunity to sign up for 5<br/>
workshops (out of literally hundreds offered!) and one of the workshops was<br/>
on letterboxing. The original instructor was unable to make it, so Silent<br/>
Doug graciously stepped in and taught the class for us. He was spectacular<br/>
and the class was AWESOME! It was called "Letterboxing 101", but Doug<br/>
renamed it "Adventures in Letterboxing". He taught us how it all started,<br/>
how to get started, and basic Letterboxing etiquette. He also came prepared<br/>
with "starter boxes" for each of us, complete with inkpads, erasers and<br/>
knives to carve with. He taught us how to carve our own stamps, and how to<br/>
make our own journals. Then we went to work, carved our stamps, and<br/>
exchanged stamps with each other. The whole thing was a blast and I left<br/>
feeling like a kid with a new toy!<br/>

Very cool,  and fortuitous as a friend and I (both Girl Scout Trainers in <br/>
Howard County) were just beginning to plan a workshop for October about <br/>
letterboxing.  I've emailed Silent Doug offline to see how much of his<br/>
class I can canibalize!  <br/>

Of course here we are planning our workshop and between us we've only <br/>
found about 25 letterboxes and have carved only one.  Still by October, we <br/>
figure we'll be expert enough to get others interested *grin*<br/>

&gt; Doug, I'm having trouble opening the pdf file of the handout.  If <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; try to open it by clicking the link, it freezes my browser.  I <br/>
&gt; also <br/>
&gt; tried just saving the target file to my hard drive and then <br/>
&gt; opening <br/>
&gt; it from there, but Adobe Reader insists the file is damaged and <br/>
&gt; can't be repaired.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm able to open other pdf files with no problem.  Has anyone else <br/>
&gt; reported an error?  Any idea what I might be doing wrong?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
