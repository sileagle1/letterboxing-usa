<div align="center"><strong><u>Jonathan's 
Dream</u></strong></div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center"><em>In 1996 Jonathan's Dream a fully 
accessible or universal playground opened in West Hartford, CT. A fully 
accessible or universal playground means that the playground meets all federal 
standards for safety so that it is accessible for children with disabilities. 
Mrs. Barzach had a vision for such a playground to honor her son, Jonathan 
who died in 1995 of spinal muscular atrophy. She and her husband raised 
$300,000, gathered over 1,000 volunteers and in October 1995 opened 
Jonathan's Dream! It is amazing and lots of fun for kids with or without 
disabilities</em><em>!  </em></div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center">Take Rte 189 and turn into the 
driveway for the Jewish Community Center &amp; Jonathan's Dream 
Playground.</div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center">Park directly in front of Jonathan's 
Dream. Please take the time to walk through this inspirational park. Enjoy! We 
sure did! </div>
<div align="center">When leaving front entrance of 
playground walk left to the driveway. Turn left and walk on the paved sidewalk. 
Walk to the back corner of the park fence. You will see a clump of a birch 
trees. Look behind for your treasure. Note: The box is on the outside of 
park fence. </div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center">Please be as inconspicuous as 
possible. This is a very busy spot! We are hoping the box will go undisturbed! 
Infact please keep us up to date via talk list as you visit it so we know how it 
is doing!  </div></body></html>
