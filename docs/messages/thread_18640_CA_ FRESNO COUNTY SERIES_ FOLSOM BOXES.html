<br/>
3/4 of Clan Jiggs went on a LB splurge today, picking up 13 out of<br/>
13 boxes in the central part of CA!<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I first went to Cohn Park in Folsom, and picked up the<br/>
Aloha and Basketball Boxes. Nice to see that they've both been<br/>
visited a few times by some familiar and new folks!<br/>
<br/>
We then went on to Fresno County, where we spent about 4 hours or so<br/>
picking up the 11 boxes in this super series, recently planted by<br/>
Sierra Sally! Folks, if you ever need a lesson in how to hide LBs in<br/>
an urban setting, this is the series! 6 of the boxes are ingeniously<br/>
planted in the city of Fresno, with the others in surrounding<br/>
communities (including 1 at the entrance to a casino!!)! Most are<br/>
drive-by, but all took a little creativity on our part to ensure we<br/>
weren't detected!<br/>
<br/>
Interesting to note that we weren't first finders for the first<br/>
three boxes, but again, some unknown (to us) folks had made the trip!<br/>
<br/>
We left a little "something" in box #11 for the next intrepid souls!<br/>
<br/>
We finally managed to drag our sorry butts home at 11:30 PM, as Dad,<br/>
in my infinite wisdom, forgot to factor in the return trip time! (3<br/>
1/2 hours)<br/>
