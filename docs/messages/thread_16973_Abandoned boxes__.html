Hi, Funhog, and thanks for pointing that out. It is true that some <br/>
letterboxes, unclaimed or not, will eventually fade into the <br/>
landscape. As a matter of fact, we're doing that on purpose with a <br/>
couple of our own boxes (they're well-hidden and should never be <br/>
trashy, just sweetly composted).<br/>
<br/>
It's been a real dilemma deciding what to do with unclaimed <br/>
letterboxes. On one hand, ownerless boxes create a liability<br/>
for others, and are often unmaintained, which causes endless <br/>
frustration. On the other hand, some unclaimed letterboxes are <br/>
actually still out in the wild and worth finding. Please be assured <br/>
that we have gone to extraordinary lengths, <br/>
with great expenditure of time and resources, to do the right thing <br/>
by these letterboxes. We have reassigned over a thousand of them in <br/>
the last year, and there are no unclaimed letterboxes left on the <br/>
LbNA website. <br/>
<br/>
You can still find links to most of them at letterboxing.org by <br/>
clicking on "where's the old site" on the homepage. The old-site<br/>
archive, like some letterboxes, won't last forever though. So if <br/>
there are any letterboxes there that you would like to rescue, <br/>
please let us know. <br/>
<br/>
Other suggestions? We welcome them! Here are some from me:<br/>
-Print out clues and share them at Gatherings as Word of Mouth Boxes.<br/>
-Box over, the way MusicWoman recently did at Gay City in CT.<br/>
-Adopt and maintain.<br/>
-Adopt and never visit. It's perfectly okay to adopt just the clues <br/>
for safekeeping without ever actually maintaining the box. Cut and <br/>
paste the clues from the old site to the new and just put a little <br/>
disclaimer along the lines of "clues adopted by Funhog, waiting for <br/>
StampinHeron to return to her nest."<br/>
-Contact the placer and encourage them to get back into the fun. <br/>
-Let them compost. The ones you're aware of can be your own personal <br/>
touchstones, kind of like a certain RI box is to WarriorWoman.<br/>

<br/>
I really do understand the reasons why the unclaimed boxes have been<br/>
removed from the new LbNA website, and I can't argue with any of them.<br/>
 I also do appreciate the length of time the webmasters have given us<br/>
before the unclaimed boxes were removed.  I just feel sad for the<br/>
active ones that are not being listed and yet rely on the LbNA listing<br/>
for visitors.  I guess there will just be some that will waste away<br/>
for reasons unknown.  If I felt it was at all ethical I would list<br/>
this particular box on my website, but I know the placer is an active<br/>
boxer in another state because we have discussed this box (and she<br/>
seemed to be a very nice person).  I even offered to service it for<br/>
her since we live near by.  Whatever the circumstances and reasons<br/>
are, and I have no idea what they are, the box was not claimed (and<br/>
now is no longer listed).  I'm attached to this box and am reluctant<br/>
to let it go because it was the first one we found, the location is<br/>
breathtaking, and I have a personal connection with the way Tom died.     <br/>
<br/>
Too bad there's not a little "scratch &amp; dent" section, like furniture<br/>
stores have, where all the little lost but active boxes can go.  But<br/>
the LbNA webmasters can't be expected to be held responsible for them<br/>
and keep up with them as well.<br/>
<br/>
Question: is the owner the only one who can post clues to the group? <br/>
But then again, if I wanted to let my box "X" go private, I'd be angry<br/>
if someone else kept it public.<br/>
