I'm very new to LBing - my first find was a spot practically right in my own<br/>
backyard that I hadn't even known existed.  I was enchanted by the<br/>
possibility of discovering more "secret" spots, and hooked right away.  The<br/>
box was "Whistle Stop Spur" by Viewfinder, and I found it on 11/10/07.<br/>
Since then I've found over 80 others, and I'm loving LB-land!<br/>
<br/>
I want to echo my thanks to those who take the time and energy to plant<br/>
boxes and create amazing clues!<br/>
