national holiday yesterday, my son and I took my husband out for his first<br/>
experience with letterboxing. An avid hiker and rock climber, we all are, he<br/>
really enjoyed tracking down a recently placed series with us through the<br/>
San Gabriel mountains.<br/>
<br/>
Then long after we are home last night, we are watching the local news and<br/>
they go live to a story of a group of hikers who had fallen down a rather<br/>
steep incline. As they start showing the footage, we instantly recognized<br/>
the location and just how close it was to where we had been earlier. As the<br/>
story continued and we saw more, we realized that the spot where people had<br/>
fallen was the same spot we had decided against climbing up when the boxing<br/>
directions told us to do so. We had viewed the hill as too steep to be safe<br/>
and planned on emailing the placer of the box to suggest they mention the<br/>
danger in their clues. While the clue does say the climb is a bit steep,<br/>
it's nearly straight up and through heavy brush well off the trail,<br/>
requiring extensive damage to the ecology /and/ the danger of falling, as<br/>
was the case with the people on the news.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to name names publicly, especially on a list, but hopefully the<br/>
people (two different sets are there, only one is asking seekers to do<br/>
dangerous things to get to their boxes) who planted the boxes in Eaton<br/>
Canyon Nature Park were also able to see the local news in Los Angeles<br/>
yesterday. And equally hopefully, since we instantly recognized the accident<br/>
location as a box placement area, the person who put the box there will<br/>
realize the danger on their own and keep others from the same fate.<br/>
<br/>
As for the hikers, they are both hospitalized in critical condition after<br/>
having to be airlifted from the scene.<br/>
<br/>
So as I said, I'm glad it wasn't our family and that, in the end, common<br/>
sense prevailed and we decided, box or no, some clues just aren't worth<br/>
tracking down and walked away from that one.<br/>

impossible box. If so, I know who to pass on the Letterbox of the<br/>
Purple Heart. I'm still holding it, and waiting for the next <br/>
deserving sole. Please no flames we've been through that already.<br/>
Prayers for a speedy recovery to those poor people. If they were <br/>
l'boxers they can email me off list.<br/>
