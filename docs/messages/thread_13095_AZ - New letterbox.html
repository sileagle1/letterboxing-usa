Clues<br/>
Have you ever taken one of those loooong road trips? The kind where <br/>
the road seems to go on forever without much to see? Well - <br/>
Interstate 40 through northern Arizona is one of those places. A <br/>
rather bleak landscape dotted with advertisements for Indian rugs, <br/>
petrified wood, and Dinosaur bones. Only a few roadside attractions <br/>
really hold any value for the nickle.<br/>
<br/>
Meteor Crater is one of those. Take a break from your road trip to <br/>
visit this extraordinary site. The crater is 700 feet deep and 4000 <br/>
feet across. It's huge. Lots of good educational information on <br/>
meteors, asteroids, and even an astronaut "wall of fame". Oh yeah ... <br/>
and there's a letterbox, too! Now that's worth a side trip, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
About 15 miles west of Winslow and 35 miles east of Flagstaff Arizona <br/>
on I-40 at Meteor Crater Road (turn off at the well marked exit) <br/>
Signs will guide you to this natural landmark. Six miles down the <br/>
road, you'll find the Meteor Crater Visitor's Center, museum, etc. <br/>
It's $12 for an adult to visit, less for kids and seniors. It's open <br/>
from 6am to 6pm. Check www.meteorcrater.com for more information.<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Find your way along the crater rim to the Moon Mountain Observatory <br/>
Telescope. This provides a great view of the entire crater. You're <br/>
standing on a raised cement platform surrounded by loose rocks and <br/>
scree. With your back to the crater (and the scope) go to the far <br/>
left corner of the platform and railings. Look below to find a <br/>
standpipe connected to the platform. The box is nestled in some rocks <br/>
next to the standpipe. <br/>
<br/>
I don't think I need to tell you to be VERY discreet when removing <br/>
and replanting the box!! In fact, I would strongly recommend removing <br/>
the box, taking the box elsewhere to stamp in, then discretely <br/>
replanting it afterwards. <br/>
