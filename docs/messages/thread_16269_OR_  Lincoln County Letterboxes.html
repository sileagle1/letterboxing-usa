<br/>
John and I went to the Coast yesterday and did a wee bit of<br/>
letterboxing.  Sorry to confirm reports that the Yaquina BAY Letterbox<br/>
is indeed gone.  Do not attempt to seek it out.  I will delete the clues<br/>
within the next day or two.  <br/>
<br/>
We were able to find the We Love Lincoln City Letterbox.  Even on a<br/>
weekday, it's still a tough one to grab and rehide discreetly, but I'm<br/>
sure glad we managed to finally get it!  <br/>
<br/>
We were also able to nab the entire Treasures of the Sea series at<br/>
Fogarty Creek State Park.  I can see why hardly anyone has signed into<br/>
Box #1.  Most folks are probably starting from the same parking lot we<br/>
started at and the clues, I believe, where the One Way sign is start at<br/>
a parking lot that is now blockaded off.  Also, the concrete/rock square<br/>
is now pulverized chunks.  We found the letterbox on the right side not<br/>
the left side, and with no cover.  We covered it with bits of the<br/>
pulverized chunks to give it a better hiding spot.  Letterboxes 2 and 3<br/>
of this series have had many visitors and were not difficult to locate.<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to get the Freddie and Tadpole's birthday letterbox at Road's<br/>
End, but the heavens opened up and it just poured!!!  It didn't let up,<br/>
either, so we thought we'd try for it at a drier time. <br/>
<br/>
We weren't able to check on Van Duzer, Devil's Lake or Devil's Punch<br/>
Bowl this trip, but they were there when we visited in July.  <br/>
<br/>
That's the latest.  Happy 'boxing to all!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
