I'm not sure how many girls, especially older girls, are in some troops, <br/>
but my troop consists of only 6 girls, two of which are iffy on the best <br/>
occasions. :) This means I could be taking as few as 3-4 but as many as <br/>
6 at any one time. I am considering placing one at our local Camporee, <br/>
if the idea goes over well. However, if I did that prior to going <br/>
hunting for one, that would mean not starting until mid-May which is <br/>
when Scouts is generally in limbo until fall, placing us not doing it <br/>
until next October at the earliest. Summer, especially for the older <br/>
ones here, is full of scout/church/youth group/band camp, girls off to <br/>
stay with the other parent (for kids of divorce), family vacations, etc. <br/>
summer is simply not do-able.<br/>
<br/>
As for a troop stamp...I'm just not sure. The kids will want to leave <br/>
their own mark and I'm not sure how a troop of 5-6 placing their <br/>
individual stamps would be any different from a family who would each <br/>
have their own stamps (or I'm assuming they would, as I've seen many <br/>
websites for kids' stamps and instructions on how to make them) or from <br/>
each of the girls finding it on their own and placing their stamp. I'd <br/>
like further explanation of this one, please, as I know my girls and <br/>
this may be the deciding factor for them (the reason being that all the <br/>
"fun" things they've come up with lately have been shot down either <br/>
through Safety Wise or the Council so this would be simply another <br/>
restriction that, to them, will make no sense).<br/>
<br/>
The Leave No Trace rule is one that would, of course, be drilled into <br/>
the girls' head prior to going and myself and my co-leader would be <br/>
watching to ensure they followed that rule. It is a fundamental rule of <br/>
Scouting and one that, at their age, I'm not sure I'd have too much <br/>
trouble with. These girls have spent much of their free time in <br/>
community service in parks so have a healthy respect of other peoples' <br/>
property and what kind of damage negligence and apathy can do.<br/>

<br/>
Try to keep your troup searching for boxes in non urban settings. <br/>
There are plenty of letterboxes that they can find in the "woods". <br/>
Some planters have several urban boxes that can go missing very <br/>
easily. City boxes are difficult to hide due to their nature. Likewise <br/>
they are difficult rehides for the finder. Most city letterboxes have <br/>
to be found with extreme stealth and rehidden the same way. These <br/>
boxes should never be searched for in a group,while other letterboxes <br/>
in the country setting can easily handle groups.<br/>
<br/>
The stealth requirements of city letterboxes could be compared to <br/>
foreign spys making "drops", or the sneakiness of drug dealers making <br/>
their transactions. Obviously you would have to give your own examples <br/>
and those would have to be more appropriate for your group than the <br/>
two I cited.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the wacky world of Letterboxing! Some letterboxers make<br/>
their own logbooks, some with few pages. Many boxers are unable to<br/>
visit their plants for frequent book replacement. If the book itself<br/>
has only a couple dozen pages, a group that stamps one stamp to a page<br/>
can easily take up half the book in one visit. Same goes with micro<br/>
boxes. The box can be so small that it can only hold a tiny log.<br/>
Putting all the individual stamps on one page or using a group stamp<br/>
will certainly be appreciated by the creator of such boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I even have two signature stamps with me at all times, one<br/>
quite small for those tiny logbooks and a larger one for the others. I<br/>
have carved stamps with kids as young as seven in classes with the<br/>
park department. As eighth graders, the girls in your group will<br/>
certainly be able to create wonderful stamps. If you look in the<br/>
"Files" section of this page you can find signature stamp carved by<br/>
twelve year old friendof mine. Look in the Signature Stamp folder<br/>
created by Legerdemaine.<br/>
<br/>
I think the idea of creating a 'training box' of your own for the<br/>
girls to find is a wonderful one. Not only would you be contributing a<br/>
creation of your own for all of us to enjoy, you would be able to<br/>
better understand the concerns being voiced here. Good Luck! Funhog<br/>

families do have family stamps that are used when<br/>
boxing together.  If you go with individual stamps try<br/>
to get more than one on each page of the log, some<br/>
logs fill up fast and placers don't always get to do<br/>
routine maintainence. I know the feeling of getting<br/>
activities aproved, don't get discouraged get them<br/>
boxing. If you can't get the girls together for boxing<br/>
go on your own to get some experience.<br/>
