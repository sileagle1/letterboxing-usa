I don't think anyone was getting upset.  We're just saying what we think, <br/>
too.  We can disagree (and even then, I'm not sure we ARE disagreeing, since we <br/>
all seem to understand each other's point of view so well) without it being a <br/>
problem .<br/>

Thank you for your apology--an dplease accept mine in return.  I was just<br/>
yanking the chain a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Your point was very valid.  I too learned about LDing from the Family FUn<br/>
article and  rushed out to find our first box, not really understanding the<br/>
sport.  While a ncie article, it emphasized the tresaure hunting aspect and<br/>
not the need for respect, discretion etc.  That is why I  would love to see<br/>
a good article that explained more about boxing.<br/>
<br/>
I think you actually started a ncie disussion--if all of us mommy's woudl<br/>
stop teasing you!<br/>
