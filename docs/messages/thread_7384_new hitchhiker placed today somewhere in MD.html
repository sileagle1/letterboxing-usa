Mystery box this weekend (as well as a nearby box and Squirrel's new <br/>
Black Hill Shore box). Thank you all for productive and enjoyable <br/>
family time! We hope to visit the Gambrill box soon, as our friend <br/>
Ranger Dave works there. Keep those HHs coming...we plan on launching <br/>
our own soon [praying to the artistic carving gods].<br/>
