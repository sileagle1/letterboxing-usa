"Should I Keep My Stamps Secret?<br/>
<br/>
      It is Dartmoor tradition to keep your personal stamp secret,<br/>
however I'm probably just about the only North American who follows<br/>
this tradition these days, most people like to exchange personal<br/>
images when they meet. Some people keep the box stamps secret and but<br/>
most do not. I keep them secret because it adds mystery to the game,<br/>
but it is up to you. Never scan other peoples' stamps you have found<br/>
and post them to the Internet without the hiders' permission. Of<br/>
course, showing your stamp book at a gathering in a pub is part of the<br/>
fun ... :-)"<br/>
<br/>
Be careful sending out stamp images that you've found. A lot of people<br/>
that plant lboxes do NOT want these images floating around without<br/>
their permission. Personally, I wouldn't grant permission to send out<br/>
my stamp images. The fun of it is finding the box and then seeing the<br/>
stamp image.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion,<br/>

Before this turns into a 3 day flame war let me state, for the record that I, Irene Martin, do hearby solemnly swear to not forward any images from any boxes other than my own, ever. Andy, I do apologize, I am newer to letterboxing (January 2004) and in my ignorance did not realize that not everyone feels the same way I do about my images. We plant and carve our images to share with whomever, however and our personal stamps are not secret. But we also do not count our finds and plants so I should have realized that some folks are a lot more serious about this than we are, and I was acting irresponsibly when I said I would collect and forward images to you. <br/>
<br/>
Mark, I aplogize profusely for worrying you and do thank you for correcting me in my ignorance. I am sure many other people share your feelings about someone other than yourself sharing your images. <br/>
<br/>
Just as an FYI, my plan was to contact the placer after each box and ask if it was okay. In the unusual event the we actually do find a box we were hunting (we are not good hunters) I always contact the placer and give them an update and thank them for their box. I would also have asked if it was okay to share the images with Andy at that time. But yes, I would have collected the image on a 3X5 card while I was at the box. So your concern about your images "floating around" is a valid one.<br/>
<br/>
SO, all that being said, we will do no such thing. We will send Andy all of our stuff, and only our stuff, as well as the hitchhiker (traveller) we are carving to send to him as well. Andy, feel free to do whatever you like with anything we send as it will all be Hikers &amp; Hounds property and we're just thrilled to be in touch with you.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize again for my ingnorance. In my enthusiasm over our new hobby and an effort to broaden our letterboxing experiences I mis-spoke.<br/>

overboard and take the fun out of it.   For goodness sake it's putting stamps in a <br/>

what are the top three activities anyway that do cure cancer?  (Maybe there <br/>
