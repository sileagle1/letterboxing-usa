Tuesday" (admission is free on the 3rd Tuesday of each month) and found Miss June <br/>
Bug hanging out with the peacocks. She was so cute standing there by the path <br/>
with her little thumb out that we scooped her up.  She went with us while we <br/>
explored the barn, Queen Anne's cottage (where the opening scenes from Fantasy <br/>
Island were filmed), and the bamboo forest, then joined us for lunch at the <br/>
Peacock Cafe, where she watched JB enjoy his first dill pickles ever.  At <br/>
present, she is taking a tour of the Southland freeways, after which we will send <br/>
her on her way.<br/>
