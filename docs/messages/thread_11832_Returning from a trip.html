<br/>
Just returned from a very brief trip to Texas.  I was determined to get at least one letterbox while there and was not disappointed.  Taking a trip out to see the Gulf of Mexico led us to Sea Rim State Park where we picked up the letterbox there.  All was well.  Unfortunately we only left a short note in the book because we were being attacked by mosquitos and the fog was rolling in.  Very nice beach and area.  It was great to see green grass and leaves on the trees.  Plus it looks like they are doing alot of work at the park for the summer.  Thanks babybear for a great stamp and sight.  <br/>
