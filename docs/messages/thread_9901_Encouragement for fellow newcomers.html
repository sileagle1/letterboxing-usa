<div>Hi Memlili:</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>    I enjoyed reading your comments. 
We, too, agree that the hunt including the hike and the new places are the best 
part of letterboxing. Nothing like a day in the fresh air with your family. The 
stamps are a bonus - but what a thrill to see my wife go crazy when she finds 
one. Keep up the good work and Happy Holidays to you!</div>

<p>I only discovered this wonderful hobby this summer, so am still a 
  "newbie".  I wanted to encourage those who are even newer than I and get 
  discouraged when they read of people who find 5 and 6 boxes or more in an 
  afternoon.  Living up here on the coast of Maine there aren't a lot of 
  letterboxers planting boxes.  I am fortunate to have Legerdemaine in my 
  neck of the woods, so there are boxes to be found.  However, most of 
  L'ger's boxes involve riddles and at least a little hike, and though many are 
  in a series, they are in different parts of the island, oftentimes a few miles 
  apart.  It is not at all uncommon for me to go out letterboxing for an 
  afternoon and to come home empty handed.  Or sometimes I come home having 
  found one box.  I think the most I have found in one day has been 
  two.  So, don't get discouraged if you feel you are way behind some 
  people.  I'm up here, having been at this for several months, pleased as 
  punch to have found almost a dozen boxes.  I love getting out in the 
  fresh air and seeing spots on this island (and in other parts of the state) 
  that I have never visited before.  I hope that no matter how many boxes 
  you find or don't find, that you all enjoy the hunt as much as the find.</p>
