The first letterbox in Harriman State Park, New York<br/>
Tuxedo, Orange County, New York<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Harriman State Park offers some of the best hiking in the metropolitan New <br/>
York/New Jersey area.  This letterbox gives you just a taste of what you <br/>
will find in this park.<br/>
<br/>
The Directions:  Enter the park by the seldom used route from the west.  Do <br/>
not go so far as Kanawauke Cirlce; do not even go so far as Aesculapius.  <br/>
Park at the trailhead just before Aesculapius.<br/>
<br/>
The red dot will then take you north.  Pass the end of the white trail on <br/>
your left, but do not stop.  Over Black and Bald Rocks you will pass.  Cross <br/>
the yellow, but pause at the blue L (look carefully in winter) and go north. <br/>
  The L's will end, but the red triangles will take their place.  Your goal <br/>
is to the northwest.  (Some trail work is being done in this area, so let me <br/>
know if this affects the route).  Some come and some leave, but seek the <br/>
triangle.<br/>
<br/>
You will now reach your goal, the famed Lemon Sqeezer.  So many places to <br/>
hide, but for security, your quest is hidden elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Take the Appalachian Trail through the narrow passageway and continue to the <br/>
remnants of the shelter at the summit.  It is here that you will begin your <br/>
search.<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm. We may have to arm wrestle for this claim. P and I place three boxes in Harriman on the 5th. Posted directions on the sixth (I think).<br/>
<br/>
Ours are farther up the line so people who use all of our boxes will get a good sampling of what a wonderful place Harriman is.<br/>

The Lemon Squeezer Letterbox<br/>
Placed April 6, 2002 by Don D.<br/>
The first letterbox in Harriman State Park, New York<br/>
Tuxedo, Orange County, New York<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Harriman State Park offers some of the best hiking in the metropolitan New <br/>
York/New Jersey area.  This letterbox gives you just a taste of what you <br/>
will find in this park.<br/>
<br/>
The Directions:  Enter the park by the seldom used route from the west.  Do <br/>
not go so far as Kanawauke Cirlce; do not even go so far as Aesculapius.  <br/>
Park at the trailhead just before Aesculapius.<br/>
<br/>
The red dot will then take you north.  Pass the end of the white trail on <br/>

the yellow, but pause at the blue L (look carefully in winter) and go north. <br/>
  The L's will end, but the red triangles will take their place.  Your goal <br/>
is to the northwest.  (Some trail work is being done in this area, so let me <br/>

<br/>
You will now reach your goal, the famed Lemon Sqeezer.  So many places to <br/>
hide, but for security, your quest is hidden elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Take the Appalachian Trail through the narrow passageway and continue to the <br/>
remnants of the shelter at the summit.  It is here that you will begin your <br/>
search.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;From the northern corner of the former shelter, go 40 paces on a bearing of <br/>
335 deg to the triangular rock.  From this rock, sight the boulder on the <br/>
next ridge at 326 deg and go there.  From this boulder, go 14 paces on a <br/>
bearing of 290 deg to the tree with the "Y."  Your quest lies 3 paces beyond <br/>
the tree under a pile of rocks.<br/>
<br/>
You can return as you came, or better yet, check maps of the area and select <br/>
another route back.<br/>
<br/>
The Hike: Approximately 2.75 miles out, 5.5 miles round trip.  Allow 4 <br/>
hours.  Moderate difficulty, with hill climbs.<br/>
<br/>
