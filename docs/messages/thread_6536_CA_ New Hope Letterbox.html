New Hope Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
This is a pseudo hybrid letterbox.  We had planned on making this a <br/>
hybrid box, but we vetoed that idea since this box is located in a <br/>
remote area ( where the 5% club camps). <br/>
<br/>
The box is located on top of a summit next to Utica Lake in the <br/>
Sierra Mts. <br/>
<br/>
Directions to Utica: <br/>
Surprise!  Your job will be locating the lake and finding out how to <br/>
get there from where you live.<br/>
<br/>
Starting point:<br/>
 After passing the campsites there is a place to park on the side of <br/>
the road. This spot is located right next to the lake. Please park <br/>
here.<br/>
