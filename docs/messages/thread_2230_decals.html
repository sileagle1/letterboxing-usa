<br/>
1) I have spoken with Kay Mohmers regarding the patch design changes. <br/>
She maintains having no involvement with the order, so the source <br/>
remains a mystery. (So don't gang up on her off-list!)<br/>
<br/>
2) While the 6" square decals are big, let's face it, they're still <br/>
okay. (Not the bumper-sticker shape we were expecting, but they are <br/>
still fine for the majority of us.) <br/>
<br/>
3) A big THANK YOU to everyone on the list who has been so <br/>
appreciative of my and Kay's efforts in being the "middlemen" in <br/>
obtaining the patches and decals. Your gratitude makes it all <br/>
worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
4) Jeremy Disch: loved your suggestions!<br/>
<br/>
5) Trish Kurdziel and all: This is a learning process for all of us. <br/>
When Kay made the first order, she had to deal with postage, <br/>
confusion, and glitches. But she guided me through the process to <br/>
make the second one, where I was able to streamline things a little <br/>
more. Nonetheless, there were still a couple of bumps in the road <br/>
(the square sticker and numerous phone calls being only a few.) Kay <br/>
has now further simplified things and has taken on the P-F merit <br/>
badge order, soon to be recieved.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, only one of you has asked, but I'm just not willing to go <br/>
toe-to-toe with the embroidery shop on this one. What I am willing to <br/>
do, however, is provide the next volunteer with the necessary info to <br/>
make the ordering processs easy and ensure that we get exactly what <br/>
we want.<br/>
<br/>
Again I thank you all for your understanding on this one. If the <br/>
decal was that easy to change, then no doubt it will be quite easy to <br/>
change back the next time around. So enjoy this round of stickers and <br/>
patches. I'm sure we'll all be 'boxing for a long time to come. And <br/>
we can enjoy several different iterations of patches and decals <br/>
(while still keeping our beautiful LbNA logo.)<br/>
<br/>
Stepping down off the soapbox...<br/>

<br/>
PS: For example...don't you think a solid white or orange background <br/>
on the decal would make it stand out more?<br/>
