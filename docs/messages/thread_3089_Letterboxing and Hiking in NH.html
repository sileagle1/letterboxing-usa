                    <div class="plaintext-content">We (4-hearted Fittons) recently spent a couple of weekends hiking and <br/>
letterboxing in the White Mountains.<br/>
<br/>
The first weekend, Carol and I dropped off the kids at a soccer camp in <br/>
Fryeburg, Maine and then went to find Petlink's covered bridge letterbox in <br/>
Bethel, Maine. Much to our surprise, Wanda, of Pete and Wanda had recently <br/>
been there too. I wonder if she found the location to be as buggy as we <br/>
did. I swear the more bug repellent we put on, the more mosquitoes there <br/>
were. We actually ran to get away from them after quickly stamping up. We <br/>
considered going for their #2 letterbox, but instead found our way to the <br/>
Sunday River Brewing Company, where we had a good meal and a few local <br/>
brews. You have to try their Amber if you ever make it there. After a night <br/>
at a B&amp;B, we did some driving and then some more hiking in the network of <br/>
trails near the Basin a little south of the Old Man.<br/>
<br/>
The next weekend I came up solo to pick up the kids on Friday and the 3 of <br/>
us spent the weekend at a motel in Franconia, NH. Saturday, we found one of <br/>
the Dead President letterboxes. It was my kids first 4,000 foot mountain <br/>
climb! When we got to the top, there were about 25 people already up there <br/>
and they gave my kids a round of applause. That was very nice. We took a <br/>
break, ate, hydrated again, and then waited for these people to leave so we <br/>
could go about the business of finding the box. The mystery nature of this <br/>
letterbox prevents me from naming the mountain we climbed, but it was a <br/>
great day. We were the first to stamp up at this particular letterbox too.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you used to Connecticut hiking, the long pants one wears to <br/>
prevent a case of poison ivy are unnecessary in the White Mountains. At <br/>
least on the mountain we climbed.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Katie, nearly 10, wants to go on a 3-4 day hiking adventure <br/>
next summer across the Presidentials in the White Mountains and along the <br/>
Franconia Ridge for our vacation. My nearly 12 year old son, Matt, wasn't <br/>
so keen on the idea. We'll probably go in late July or early August. Sure <br/>
it'll be hot, but if anyone wants to join us, great. The more the merrier.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mark, thanks for a nice story. I had to laugh when you said you ran <br/>
away from mosquitoes. It seems to me the mosquitoes in New England are <br/>
especially aggressive this year!<br/>
<br/>
Your post makes me want to get out and climb above treeline.  But I may <br/>
want until a cooler time of year :-)<br/>
