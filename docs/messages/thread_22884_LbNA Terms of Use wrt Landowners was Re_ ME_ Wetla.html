placer and make sure that they are compliant with the requirements <br/>
when using the LbNA site.  As many of you will have noticed whenever <br/>
you post a box on the site you have to check that you agree to the <br/>
Terms of Use (ToU).<br/>

"By submitting clues to this website, you warrant the following: That <br/>
there is a safe, legal, and trespass free route to any boxes the <br/>
clues may lead to, and that land owner/land manager permission exists <br/>
to place the box(es) the clues lead to where they are placed."<br/>

&gt; Hi folks,<br/>
&gt; This is mostly directed to Choi, or others that might know of this<br/>
&gt; particular box. If you're not familiar with what I'm talking about,<br/>
&gt; just disregard. I don't usually read this list anymore, let alone<br/>
&gt; check the "what's new" but I happened to check the list and noticed<br/>
&gt; that there was a new listing for Wetland Loop.<br/>
&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br/>
boxnum=19385&amp;boxname=Wetland_Loop<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, that's kinda funny because I originally planted a box in the<br/>
&gt; SAME location about 2 years ago for the Water District. This was a <br/>
box<br/>
&gt; that you need to ask permission for since the Portland Water <br/>
District<br/>
&gt; property is private and there is restricted access around Sebago <br/>
Lake<br/>
&gt; which is also a drinking water source. I'm quite puzzled to see that<br/>
&gt; there is a listing for essentially the SAME clue that I wrote...<br/>
