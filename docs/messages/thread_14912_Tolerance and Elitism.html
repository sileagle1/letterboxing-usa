                    <div class="plaintext-content">A quick review of the LbNA site reminds us that, for the most part, this <br/>
hobby is a mere 5 years old in this country.  A little research in the <br/>
archives reveals very few of us can really be considered "veterans" (of <br/>
this list, not the hobby).  There's no justification for anyone to feel <br/>
superior - or inferior, or that their thoughts are more or less important.<br/>
<br/>
Like the vast majority of list members, I post infrequently (a couple dozen <br/>
times since I joined in May 02); most of us just let the controversy roll <br/>
by.  Let's all take a deep breath, remember that we're ALL really <br/>
"newbies", and see if we can let some things slide by without <br/>
responding.  Email is a great tool, but it makes it real easy to get your <br/>
feelings hurt when it wasn't intended or to say things you'd never dream of <br/>
saying if you were face to face with someone.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
