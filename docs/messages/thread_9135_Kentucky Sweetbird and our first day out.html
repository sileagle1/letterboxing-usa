                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a great first day out.  There aren't many boxes in our area but we<br/>
got the Kentucky Sweetbird and four out of six geocaches.<br/>
<br/>
For Deanne and Dave - The instructions were accurate until a week ago.  They<br/>
have chopped down the tree and about half of the rockwall is gone.  The box<br/>
is still there and in great shape.  Email me at celticrelics@commandnet.net<br/>
and I can send you a photo of how it looks now so you can update the<br/>
directions.<br/>
<br/>
We got there as the Chamber of Commerce was closing and Kathy was in the<br/>
parking lot getting ready to leave.  She chatted with us for a while about<br/>
letterboxing and was as nice as you described.  She seemed excited that<br/>
someone was out looking for the box.<br/>
<br/>
We still haven't been able to come up with a team name.  The only thing out<br/>
of the ordinary that happened today was how many times I fell and scraped my<br/>
hands.  I don't want to be known as the clumsiest team in the south, so we<br/>
will keep searching for the perfect name.<br/>
<br/>
For now we are<br/>
John, Helen, and Ian<br/>
P-0, F-1<br/>
