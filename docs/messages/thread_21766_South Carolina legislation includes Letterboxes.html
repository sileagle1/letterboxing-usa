Wondering if any of you had seen the South Carolina Bill that makes<br/>
Letterboxing and Geocaching illegal in many areas of South Carolina. <br/>
Active LBers may want to join with the cachers to help sway the<br/>
opinions of their legislaters.<br/>
http://www.scstatehouse.net/sess116_2005-2006/bills/3777.htm<br/>
Discussion is going on in the geocaching.com forums, general topics<br/>
area about the committee meetings and such.<br/>
I am NOT trolling!!!!  I wanted to bring this to the attention of<br/>
letterboxers nationwide.  My husband and I are in Missoula, MT and<br/>
have found many of the letterboxes there over the past 2 years.  <br/>
My husband is currently in the process of creating a letterboxing PDA<br/>
reader where you can download letterboxing html pages into the Plucker<br/>
reader.  If he ever finishes it he is planning on offering it for free<br/>
to intersted parties.  But at the rate he is going someone else will<br/>
have developed one already. :)<br/>

I'm new to this but, I have to agree with the State on<br/>
this one. What SC is trying to do is make it illegal<br/>
in cemetaries, archeological sites, or on historic<br/>
properties of the State. It is NOT a State-wide ban on<br/>
geocaching or letterboxing. Quite frankly, I wouldn't<br/>
want someone planting/digging up a LB around a family<br/>
member's grave - would you? Here is a quick synopsis<br/>
of the bill:<br/>
<br/>
TO AMEND THE CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, 1976, BY<br/>
ADDING SECTION 16-17-605 SO AS TO DEFINE THE TERMS<br/>
"GEOCACHE", "GEOCACHING", AND "LETTERBOXING", TO<br/>
PROVIDE THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL TO ENGAGE IN GEOCACHING OR<br/>
LETTERBOXING IN CEMETERIES, ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES, OR ON<br/>
THE HISTORIC PROPERTIES OF THE STATE, AND TO PROVIDE A<br/>
PENALTY.<br/>

I'm sorry but, I have to ask. Do you really agree?  Do<br/>
you think the dead people mind too?  Have you not<br/>
noticed how many cemeteries are involved in this<br/>
hobby?  Are you going to boycott boxing in cemeteries<br/>
now?  You will miss out on some fantastic boxes from<br/>
some very talented people.  One more thing, do you<br/>
really think we hide them so anyone would have to go<br/>
"digging around graves" to find them?  <br/>
Have you looked at the newboxers site....like ...at<br/>
all?  <br/>

I wouldn't say that it was beaten to death.  I would<br/>
say that it was being discussed alot.  It really<br/>
couldn't be beaten to DEATH without knowing the<br/>
outcome in SC.  Death is pretty final and I thought it<br/>
wasn't a dead issue yet..... From what I read in the<br/>
archives.<br/>
You're right, the archives are good source for<br/>
information on this topic.<br/>

I did use the search function.  Nothing about cemeterys or cemetarys<br/>
comes up for me.  But I'm probably spelling it wrong.<br/>
While the legislation focuses on cemeterys, it also includes other<br/>
areas. Note the part about historic properites:<br/>
<br/>
(B)    It is unlawful for a person to engage in the activity of<br/>
geocaching or letterboxing in a cemetery, archeological sites, or on<br/>
the historic properties of the State, as defined in Section<br/>
60-12-10(4)(4) "Historic properties" means those buildings, sites,<br/>
objects, structures, and districts that are listed in the National<br/>
Register of Historic Places.<br/>
<br/>
Since lots of places in South Carolina are listed on the National<br/>
Register, and entire portions of cities are parts of Historic<br/>
Districts on the National Register, LBs in those areas would be<br/>
illegal and subject placers and finders to:<br/>
<br/>
(C)    A person who violates the provisions of this section is guilty<br/>
of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, must be fined not more than one<br/>
hundred dollars or imprisoned for not more than thirty days.<br/>
<br/>
(D)    Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (C), the judge, in<br/>
his discretion, may order a person convicted of a violation of this<br/>
section to perform up to one hundred hours of community service.<br/>
<br/>
(E)    The provisions of this section do not preclude a person from<br/>
being charged with a violation of Section 16-17-600 in addition to a<br/>
violation of this section." <br/>
<br/>
True, it only affects South Carolina anyway. For now.  1 or 2 current<br/>
listings may be affected, and only  one catches my eye as in a cemetery:<br/>

&gt; My husband threatened to put one of the permanent flower vases on <br/>
&gt; my grave<br/>
&gt; site with a letterbox in the bottom of it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just found a box last Sunday exactly like that - lift the metal vase on the headstone and look in the space beneath to find the box!  The LB was planted in tribute to the man by his granddaughter.  We enjoyed reading a little about the man and looking at some of the interesting headstones in the cemetery. We did not feel that we were disturbing or otherwise violating the nature of the cemetery.  We have found a few other interesting boxes in cemeteries and don't think it is necessarily a bad place to place a box.<br/>

Just last week, letterboxing in Nebraska <br/>
took me to three cemeteries and two historic <br/>
properties. This is not to mention the <br/>
numerous others I have found (and hidden) <br/>
in such places over the years. These are <br/>
EXACTLY the kind of spot that many letterboxers <br/>
want to mark with a box. I have never found <br/>
a box that entailed 'digging' other than <br/>
brushing aside forest duff and anyone who <br/>
digs to find a letterbox is just downright <br/>
thoughtless in my book. Funhog<br/>

Hi Seth and others,<br/>
<br/>
Ohhh...I didn't mean to start anything here. Like I<br/>
said I am new to this hobby...only one week new. I had<br/>
no idea these things were in cemetaries. I have been<br/>
concentrating on those in the parks near my home. We<br/>
newbies are just learning - no flames please. I<br/>
thoughts on cemetary boxes:  If they are hidden in<br/>
wooded areas away from actual graves that's ok with<br/>
me. If they are in among trees, I think that's ok as<br/>
well. If a person who planted it did so on their own<br/>
family member's grave, I'm good with that too. But, if<br/>
it is planted in/near a grave that is not the<br/>
planter's family member (just some random grave), I<br/>
would have a problem with it (kinda creepy). I was<br/>
obviously seeing the pending bill from an outsider's<br/>
point of view. <br/>

&gt; noticed how many cemeteries are involved in this<br/>
&gt; hobby?  Are you going to boycott boxing in<br/>
&gt; cemeteries<br/>
&gt; now?  You will miss out on some fantastic boxes from<br/>
&gt; some very talented people.  One more thing, do you<br/>
&gt; really think we hide them so anyone would have to go<br/>
&gt; "digging around graves" to find them?  <br/>
&gt; Have you looked at the newboxers site....like ...at<br/>

The bill is much more far reaching than cemeteries--those are just <br/>
the tip of the iceberg.  Imagine not being able to place a box <br/>
anywhere where there is anything remotely historically interesting.  <br/>
You know, like the whole of Downtown Charleston because it includes <br/>
DISTRICTS!  Like I said, cemeteries are just the tip of the iceberg.<br/>

&gt; I'm new to this but, I have to agree with the State on<br/>
&gt; this one. What SC is trying to do is make it illegal<br/>
&gt; in cemetaries, archeological sites, or on historic<br/>
&gt; properties of the State. It is NOT a State-wide ban on<br/>
&gt; geocaching or letterboxing. Quite frankly, I wouldn't<br/>
&gt; want someone planting/digging up a LB around a family<br/>
&gt; member's grave - would you? Here is a quick synopsis<br/>
&gt; of the bill:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; TO AMEND THE CODE OF LAWS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, 1976, BY<br/>
&gt; ADDING SECTION 16-17-605 SO AS TO DEFINE THE TERMS<br/>
&gt; "GEOCACHE", "GEOCACHING", AND "LETTERBOXING", TO<br/>
&gt; PROVIDE THAT IT IS UNLAWFUL TO ENGAGE IN GEOCACHING OR<br/>
&gt; LETTERBOXING IN CEMETERIES, ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES, OR ON<br/>
&gt; THE HISTORIC PROPERTIES OF THE STATE, AND TO PROVIDE A<br/>
