<br/>
Having been in the process of replacing the Powells Bookstore letter <br/>
box in Portland Oregon I went to retrieve th clues from the site <br/>
(they were lost in my move from California) and low and behold it has <br/>
been removed from the site.  This annoyed me just a bit as I just <br/>
noticed less than a week ago that the box was listed as abandoned and <br/>
sent an email in claiming the box and telling them that it was being <br/>
replaced soon.  Can someone tell me why it was taken down?<br/>
<br/>
Also if anyone could help that might have a copy of the clues (Hint <br/>
to Sir Balthazar) I would greatly appreciate them sending them to me.<br/>
<br/>
Also a question for the group -- IF you carve a set of stamps and <br/>
decide where they are going to go, then have to move and leave the <br/>
stamps with your friends to place as there were made for that area -- <br/>
would you still count it as a plant?  What would you count it as?<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all most well,<br/>
