<br/>
With two kids and multiple colored ink pads, we have a real problem being <br/>
discreet as well.  So far, not too many people have been around when we <br/>
stamp in.  The only thing we try and avoid is going to get the box and <br/>
putting it back when people are around.  We worry they might go back and get <br/>
the box to see what we were doing.  If they see us on the trail, they <br/>
probably think we are working on something we brought with us and not <br/>
anything related to that particular part of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we can't offer any good advice, but, at least you know you're not <br/>
alone!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  when our ink pads falls, they always seem to land on Miss Ma!  She is <br/>
a very colorful girl.  I'm not always sure the ink gets on her accidentally <br/>
as it often covers each little fingertip in a different rainbow color -- <br/>
pretty hard to manage by accident!<br/>

&gt;Many of the clues say to be discreet when stamping up because of the<br/>
&gt;boxes being in a busy area. Other than trying to look nonchalant<br/>
&gt;until everyone leaves how can you do this? With three people, three<br/>
&gt;log books, three stamps, inkpad and lid, pen, box, its logbook and<br/>
&gt;stamp, dozens of zip lock bags, wet and dry paper towels for cleaning<br/>
&gt;stamps, even with six hands it seems like such a production. Anyone<br/>
&gt;worked out a process to make stamping up easy and discreet. Mostly we<br/>
&gt;must look like a circus with lots of "Don't drop that!" "Grab the<br/>
&gt;bag!" "Hold this open until it drys!" And why if you drop an inkpad<br/>
&gt;does it always land ink down?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It's been so wet here that you don't dare set anything down. Or is<br/>
&gt;that the catch -- wait until it is dryer so you can sit down? Any<br/>

There are nine of us... Two mothers, and seven kids... boys 11 and 10 and girls 10, 9, 7, 5, and 3!<br/>
<br/>
We've finally gotten it down to a chaotic science LOL<br/>
<br/>
When we get to a box, the line up with their personal stamps.  I take their stamps, ink them then hand them back.  Behind me is Elegant Elk (the other mom) who holds the log book so each child can stamp in, because of course as everyone knows, you can't stamp someone else's (we were told "Its illegal or something).  She also holds the paper towel which gets handed to the next kid when you're done with it.  When they are done, they wipe their stamp and pass the paper towel to the next kid put their personal stamp away and take out their own logbook. When I get to the end, I go back and get the box stamp and ink pad and begin stamping each kid's book. For some reason, it's ok for one person to stamp all the books with the box's stamp... go figure.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the older kids hold our log books and stamps, sometimes not.  If not, we do our own, and wonder why we're so crazy as to be hooked up in such a nutty hobby.  If we have the presence of mind and a modicum of sanity left, we even remember to write something.<br/>
<br/>
It gets better and a little more organized with each box we find.  I think the kids are finally getting the concept that it we get it done smoothly the more we can enjoy the rest of the hike and get to the next box sooner... but then again, maybe not...<br/>
<br/>
If anyone with a tribe knows the best way, I'd appreciate some pointers!<br/>

The best investment I made as far as letterboxing paraphernalia is the "Neat Sheet." I have no connection to the company (unfortunately)!   http://www.theneatsheet.com/ <br/>
<br/>
 Its a nice sized ground cover made from some alien technology.  It folds then rolls relatively small and I strap it to the bottom of my pack with those two straps I never knew what to do with before now.  It is water repellent and washable.  It's great to put your stuff down on or to sit on when it's wet, and it's great for lunching on when the 3 year old screams because there's an ant on her shoe!<br/>
<br/>
If you call customer service, they'll even send you a $2 (I think it was $2) off coupon.  But at $7.99 its still a deal.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Usually we try to be discreet about pulling the box out or putting it back. <br/>
Once we have it out, we usually step some distance away and stamp away. With <br/>
our sketch book logs, colored pens etc, we figure we look like a couple of <br/>
artist types doing some artwork. Most people don't look twice. <br/>
<br/>
We figure that it's most important not to attract attention to the box's <br/>
hiding place...though I suppose that is how a lot of people stumble upon the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of sitting on the soggy ground...I have recently taken to carrying a <br/>
couple of rolled up trash bags in my pack to sit on when stamping in. I just <br/>
cannot seem to stamp in while standing or squatting. I love them, because the <br/>
roll up to the size of a fist, yet they allow us to spread out all our stuff <br/>
while sitting on them.<br/>

Happy boxing!<br/>

drop things when we're standing over poison ivy.<br/>

If it's wet out, we are very often wearing our rain pants so sitting <br/>
in puddles isn't a big deal. Bruce also carries a little folding stool <br/>
strapped to his pack, which is very handy especially when Erin is with <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
We, too, try to move a little away from a hiding spot in case we are <br/>
happened upon while stamping. Stamp time usually equals snack time so <br/>
that's what most people probably think of rubbermaid boxes &amp; ziplock <br/>
bags.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mosquitos are fierce with all the rains we've had, so we have tried <br/>
to shorten our stamp-in time a little.<br/>
<br/>
We noticed that another letterboxer pre-stamps onto stickers <br/>
(Moonstone Baby?). Although we prefer stamping directly, we have <br/>
recently taken to using this idea for the stamps in our group that <br/>
take more than one color.<br/>
<br/>
We do these multi-color inked stamps on white self-stick labels <br/>
before we go. This allows us to put in a nice image quickly without <br/>
getting ravaged by mosquitos. <br/>
Fluff hasn't taken to this approach so she still stamps in. She uses <br/>
only one color, so I can live with that.<br/>
<br/>
We also keep only a single family log book - that saves us time as we <br/>
stamp the box's image only once. That just happened to be how we <br/>
started and the kids have turned down later offers to get them <br/>
separate ones. I suspect it would be hard to get kids who currently <br/>
have their own book to adopt this though!<br/>
<br/>
We don't have a perfect system  -- discussion about who's turn it is <br/>
to do what can be frustrating - especially when I'm trying to bat <br/>
away the mosquitos!<br/>
