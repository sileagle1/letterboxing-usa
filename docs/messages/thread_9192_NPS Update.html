<br/>
<br/>Thank you to all of you that wrote to me with help on the relevant NPS regulations. It was extremely helpful.
<br/>
<br/>I spent some time with the superintendent of the Springfield Armory today, and we discussed placing a letterbox on their property. The super really likes the idea, though only if it is inside the building. The Armory is basically a rifle museum, and the NPS takes security at this site very seriously. They don't want a box outside, as that would mean that people could be coming onto the property when the museum is closed. So, we're going to place a box inside the museum instead.
<br/>
<br/>The idea is to create a series of questions based on the exhibits. If the questions are all answered correctly (taken from the exhibits) then you get the box. It might be hidden somewhere in the Armory, or simply behind the ranger's desk, depending on how they decide to do it.
<br/>
<br/>So, we're making progress. With luck, the box will be in place sometime before the end of the year.
