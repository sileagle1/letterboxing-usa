                    <div class="plaintext-content">On January 19, 2002 Funhog placed the Crooked River Bridge Letterbox at <br/>
the Peter Skene Ogden Scenic Viewpoint near Terrebonne in Deschutes <br/>
County Oregon. Until the new bridge was opened in 2001, the vintage <br/>
bridge spanning the plunging Crooked River Gorge was a landmark that <br/>
travelers to Eastern Oregon always remembered. The new bridge is much <br/>
safer for drivers but doesn't have nearly the scenic impact of the old. <br/>
Today, travelers can park their cars and walk out on to the old highway <br/>
bridge and gaze directly down to the Crooked River, 300 feet below. <br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: The viewpoint  is located approximately two miles <br/>
north of the town of Terrebonne on Highway 97. Park here and walk out <br/>
to the pedestrian bridge (DO NOT take your dog with you. For some <br/>
reason, dogs have a penchant for jumping over the edge!) <br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: Walk along the gorge with the stone wall on your <br/>
right. Just before you pass under the railroad bridge, go left. Keep <br/>
barbs on your right and rails up above. When your upward view shows <br/>
four black stripes directly overhead, the letterbox rests beneath lava.   <br/>

Sanctuary in Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon. This trail received a great deal of damage during the <br/>
1996 flood season but today you will be able to see the recovery of the forest in the landslide areas. <br/>
There are stands of old growth all along the 3/4 mile trail. Watch for large western hemlock, Douglas fir <br/>
and western red cedar. You may even be lucky enough to spot a pileated woodpecker amongst the trees.<br/>

Newport, Lincoln County, Oregon. The short nature trail at this park winds its way along a stream through <br/>
a grove of large spruce trees. While at the park you can also take a stroll down to the beach.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: Beverly Beach is located 7 miles north of Newport along Highway 101, on the east side <br/>
of the road. There is a free day use parking area on the left side of the entrance road, before you reach <br/>
the fee station. The nature trail begins beside campsite #C3, past the visitor center.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:  A bench is waiting in the garden of fallen giants. At 100 degrees magnetic, a forked <br/>
tree leans to hear the whisper of running water. The letterbox is just behind, nestled beneath a mossy <br/>
limb. <br/>

On August 29, 2002 Funhog placed the Fairy Falls Letterbox in the Columbia
Gorge near the town of Troutdale, Multnomah County, Oregon. This lovely
cascade is about 1.25 miles up the Wahkeena Falls Trail and is the perfect
home for a diminutive wood sprite.
</p><p>To the trailhead: from Portland go east on I-84 to exit28/Bridal Veil.
Then continue east about three more miles on the Scenic Highway to the
parking area for Wahkeena Falls.
</p><p>To the letterbox: Zig-zag your way up the hill. When the torrent forks
youre almost there. Viewing Fairy Falls from the center of the plank,
spot an evergreen at 205 degrees magnetic. Wend your way to its base and
you will find a hollow log, the dwelling of fairies.
<br/> 
</p><p><i>note: this trail is also home to Ryan Carpenters wonderful replacement
for Der Mad Stampers long lost Wahkeena Falls Letterbox. For that clue 
refer to Talk List  message #10423.    <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/10423">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/10423</a></i>
