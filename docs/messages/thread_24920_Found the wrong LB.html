And here I thought you were going to talk about finding a box that you <br/>
were not looking for. I did that once, was looking for one box at Rocky <br/>
Gap State Park in MD and ended up coming across a completely different <br/>
one that I did not have the clues for. Never did find that first one.<br/>
<br/>
Found a Crayola Posse mystery box that way once as well.<br/>
<br/>
Who cares how it is or is not listed online. Did you find a box? Did you <br/>
have fun doing so? Isn't that all that really matters?<br/>

I changed a status to found on a box that is not by the placer that I have listed.  How do I change the status back (unfound) since the box I have is not by the same person as listed on LBNA?<br/>
<br/>
