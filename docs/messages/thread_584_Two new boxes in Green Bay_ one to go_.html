I have just come back from a wonderful trip to Aztalan State Park/Rock<br/>
Lake in Lake Mills.  I have deposited a letterbox on the State Park. <br/>
It was a person and a half to place.  The black flies loved my hair.  I<br/>
had a few of them caught in it.  Ask Steve, he killed one of them for<br/>
me.  Agh.......<br/>
Clue:<br/>
Take 41 South to 26 South to 151 South.  Get onto I-94 East to Lake<br/>
Mills.  Once in Lake Mills follow signs to Aztalan.  Then follow signs<br/>
to state park.  Park in the last car park the park has to offer.  At<br/>
the pump, you want a compass bearing of 100 degrees. The box is behind<br/>
a tree on the tree line at that degree.  Have fun.  The scereny is<br/>
beautiful.  (Mitch, Steven has a website where there is a map, I'll<br/>
have him send it to you with my picture scanned.  Thanks, xoxox)<br/>
<br/>
The second is another box at UWGB's arboretum.  I have some favorite<br/>
spots there and I want others to find them.  There is one more spot in<br/>
the arboretum that I have to place something.  Then that area should be<br/>
done.  <br/>
Clue: <br/>
The path for this box starts at Sherwood Golf Course.  There is a sign<br/>
showing the "entrace" to the arboretum.  Follow that over the bridge. <br/>
One can touch the canopy it is so high.  At the end of the bridge, take<br/>
11 paces.  To your right should be a small stone path leading to the<br/>
golf course.  On your compass you should spy a 90 degree course.  The<br/>
box is directly in front of you.  Good Hunting.  Die xo<br/>
(Mitch, the pictures need to get developed.  I'll have Steve send them<br/>
for me.  Thanks, xoxox)<br/>
<br/>
I am planning on placing the last in my attempts at UWGB, plus one at<br/>
my favorite park in GB, then there is one for La Salle Park I'd like to<br/>
do tomorrow if the weather holds out.  More to come.  Love you all. <br/>
Die xoxo<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I can attest to the flies and their obsessive<br/>
behavior over Dierdra's hair, but the very itchy bites<br/>
on my leg indicate to me that their attentions were<br/>
not exclusive to her.<br/>
<br/>
I think you might want to note that those directions<br/>
start at Green Bay, though Madison is the closest city<br/>
to the park.  I-94 connects Madison and Milwaukee, and<br/>
other places of course, but Aztalan and Lake Mills are<br/>
about 30 min. east of Madison.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Madison, I tried to check on the Majestic<br/>
Theater letterbox while I was in the area on a very<br/>
wet morning with a farmer's market going on all around<br/>
the capitol square, Maxwell Street Days on State St.,<br/>
and a canoe race portaging between the two lakes by<br/>
walking them around the square.  With all that<br/>
activity, I figured no one would bother paying<br/>
attention to me skulking around in the bushes by the<br/>
capitol.  Unfortunately, I was unable to locate the<br/>
letterbox. Either it's still there and I just didn't<br/>
look hard enough, or it has gone missing.  I'd not be<br/>
surprised if it were gone, of course, with all the<br/>
activity that goes on around there!<br/>
