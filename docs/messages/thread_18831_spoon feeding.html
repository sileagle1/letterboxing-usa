little hard work makes a box much more rewarding.  There are plenty of boxes out <br/>
there for people to cut their teeth on.  There are thousands of box clues on <br/>
the LBNA website.  If you want more than that, you need to work a littlke <br/>
harder, snoop around and get a little lucky.  Hard-earned experience is exactly that <br/>
- earned through time and practice.<br/>

Hoarding information, clues, <br/>
or insight gained by hard-earned experience goes against the very <br/>
nature of letterboxing, the way I see it. <br/>
