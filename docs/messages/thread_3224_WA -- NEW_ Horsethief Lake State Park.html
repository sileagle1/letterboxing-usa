                    <div class="plaintext-content">A new letterbox was placed by Amanda Briles the Paisley Orca and Maronie<br/>
on September 2, 2001.  It is in South Central Washington at Horsethief<br/>
Lake State Park near Wishram, Washington in Klickitat County.  Open from<br/>
April to late October.  It is not too far from the Mary Hill Museum.  <br/>
<br/>
Horsethief Lake was named by men working on The Dalles Dam who thought<br/>
the area looked like a good place for a Western movie shoot.  Lewis and<br/>
Clark stopped here, and there are indian petroglyph tours (you must<br/>
reserve in advance to see) on Fridays and Saturdays.  She Who Watches is<br/>
possibly the most famous petroglyph in the Pacific NW.<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Horsethief Lake State Park is located on Hwy 14, 1.5 miles<br/>
East of the junction of Hwy 14 and US 197.  It is 7.9 miles west of<br/>
Wishram.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:   In the day use parking area, stand at the flagpole and face<br/>
directly magnetic North.  You'll see a row of trees.  Head along the<br/>
right side of these trees till they end and it crosses another row of<br/>
trees running East/West.  Continue straight through this row and onto a<br/>
trail.  You'll come to a junction in the trail.  Go West Young Man (&amp;<br/>
Woman!) for 85 paces and stop.  The ranger lives at 245 degrees.  The<br/>
letterbox lives down and North at approximately 350 degrees, 12 paces<br/>
snuggled under a rock at the base of baby evergreen.<br/>

decades than I care to admit I finally saw She Who Watches in the <br/>
flesh, or is it stone? In addition, I got to place the first stamp in <br/>
your book at the Park. Great looking stamp! FYI Do not, I repeat do <br/>
not, stay overnight in this campgroung unless you are deaf. It has got <br/>
to be the noisiest place I've ever tried to sleep. Funhog<br/>
