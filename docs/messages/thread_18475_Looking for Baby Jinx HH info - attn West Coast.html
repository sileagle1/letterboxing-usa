The residents came from many walks <br/>
Some were smart but all were caught. <br/>
One way in and two ways out. <br/>
One's alive the other's naught. <br/>
Over the days and years I'm told <br/>
Some grew weary some grew bold <br/>
But never the less they all grew old <br/>
Some were strong and some were ill <br/>
Some lived long and some were killed <br/>
Those that couldn't walk out the gate <br/>
Were lain to rest but not in state. <br/>
Visit this place of silent din <br/>
where mortals past are interred in. <br/>
Look to your left and see what may rise <br/>
They don't go to heaven in anyone's eyes <br/>
Look beneath, for that's where it lies <br/>
Make sure you're not seen by any spies <br/>
There are some boards there is no ledge <br/>
It's behind these that The ROCK is wedged <br/>

That box was in a gutsy spot--very pricarious.  It was in an <br/>
*extremely* public area, and even a gust of wind could have knocked <br/>
it loose.  The remarkable thing about this box isn't so much that <br/>
it's probably missing than that it managed to last for so long.  Or <br/>
maybe the extra weight of the hitchhiker caused it to fall out of <br/>
place?  Who knows?<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad I got a chance to find it, though, because it was such a <br/>
ballsy box.  I wouldn't have had the courage to stick it there!<br/>
