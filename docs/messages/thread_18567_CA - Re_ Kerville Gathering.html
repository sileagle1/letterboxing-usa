<br/>
We just wanted to take a second or two to publically acknowledge the <br/>
tremendous job done by Don and Gwen this past weekend! The 4 members <br/>
of Clan Jiggs had an absolutely monstrous time, experiencing rafting <br/>
and boxing like never before! We also had the chance to renew <br/>
acquaintances with Ryan and Amanda, and meet some other really great <br/>
folks, like Sierra Sally (keep on boxing!!) <br/>
<br/>
We managed to get 8 out of the 10 special boxes (clues now posted), <br/>
and I even took a long, hard stab at the Tubatulabal Box literally <br/>
out in the middle of nowhere! <br/>
<br/>
My 5 yr old fell in love with Gwen, and my 9 yr old carved and <br/>
planted her very first HH - "Sunnyside" - later found by Sierra <br/>
Sally. For all you "LB Vets" out there, watching her face light up <br/>
with delight at LBer recognition sorta makes the whole thing <br/>
worthwhile!<br/>
<br/>
For the record, we ended up with 17 finds, 1 attempt, 2 HH and 1 <br/>
Plant and a whole pile of great memories!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
Pete, Erin, Erica and Sarah aka Jiggs<br/>
