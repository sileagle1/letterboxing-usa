traveled many miles, often hooded and cloaked in secrecy and sometimes openly <br/>
by day. But when it became known among elves and men that one of the Palantir <br/>
were loose in the land I thought it critical to attempt a rescue. Because, as <br/>
we all know, to peer into the smokey depths of the ancient seeing stones is <br/>
to risk revealing oneself to the searching Eye. Only the truly strong could <br/>
survive and only by birthright, such a one as Aragorn son of Arathorn.<br/>
<br/>
So in haste to Weathertop I flew, and found there in blackened cairn the <br/>
runic cypher of Gandalf the Grey's great battle, and did take the Palantir <br/>
into safekeeping. It shall be hidden, not deep in cave like the One Ring, but <br/>
high on sunlit peak until one worthy of its spell should arrive and carry it <br/>
forth.<br/>
<br/>
Long live the memory of Frodo, who in rescuing Middle Earth ended it, <br/>

Meriadoc Brandybuck<br/>
