I know about where is box is. (I don't want to say too much as it is a<br/>
mystery box) Went to look for it twice, but didn't find it. I was<br/>
wondering if anyone here has found and can help me out at all. I'm not<br/>
sure how bad this area flood at the end of June and the box might have<br/>
been washed away - if not removed before that.<br/>
Any info would be great.<br/>

Thanks for your input. "the to be continued" is why I'm asking if anyone found this box, in case it never was planted or whatever. The only email address I've found for the placer is no longer in use. This is just one of those things that I just want to solve the mystery, if the box is gone - no big deal, but if it is still here I would like to adopt if I can and let others look for it to. <br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
