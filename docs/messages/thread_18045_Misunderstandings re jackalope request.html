&gt; OK, I am totally serious about asking for a stuffed<br/>
&gt; jackalope.  I am doing a paper for bio, about a species that<br/>
&gt; might be found on campus.  In order to show that it might be<br/>
&gt; found on campus, I want to take a picture of it next to the<br/>
&gt; college sign.  (someone else already took bigfoot, which I am<br/>
&gt; curious about).  So online pictures or the big statue in<br/>
&gt; south dakota won't help.  Does anyone have a stuffed one?<br/>
