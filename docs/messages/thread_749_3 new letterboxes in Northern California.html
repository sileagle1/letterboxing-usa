Thanks for the reply.  Just joined the mailing list so I should respond a<br/>
bit faster.<br/>
<br/>
I have not had time to try the other Bay Area letterboxes.  Like about 90%<br/>
of other others in the US, I , too, was greatly inspired by the article in<br/>
Smithsonian.  I had made up these letter boxes within a month of reading the<br/>
article, just never got around the placing them.<br/>
<br/>
After doing some recent searching on the web, I noticed that others were in<br/>
the area and so I quickly (can you say "next day") thought of a good place<br/>
to place them.  I had orginally thought of placing them at the Mission Peak<br/>
Regional Preserve, but it's about hilly and not as easy to access as the SF<br/>
Bay Wildlife Refuge.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the letterboxes I've set out were done on the cheap.  I was worried<br/>
about them being found by the general public and disappearing.  The stamps<br/>
are some ones that I found from a collections of kid stamps that my<br/>
daughters had running around.<br/>
<br/>
While I'm posting here, I might as well ask one question:  While placing the<br/>
letterboxes, I was worried about a ranger seeing me place the letterboxes<br/>
and having to spend a while explaining it all to him/her.  Has anyone<br/>
researched or talked to any local park districts and asked them how they<br/>
feel about letterboxes being placed in their parks?  It's not really<br/>
littering, but it could be construed to be littering.<br/>
I was just wondering.<br/>

<br/>
Has anyone contacted Smithsonian Magazine with the LBNA website and asked <br/>
them to do a follow up story?<br/>

Have you ever wondered about heaven and what the "entrance requirements" are? <br/>
There are many theories but you can find out for yourself what the Bible <br/>
says.  These are just a few passages that explain God's plan:<br/>
     Acts 2:36-40        Romans 10:14-17     Matt 10:32-33<br/>
     Romans 10:9-10   Acts 8:34-38            Acts 2:38<br/>
     Matt 28:19-20       Mark 16:16              Acts 22:16<br/>
     1 Peter 3:21<br/>
How do you do that? These passages are good examples of how:<br/>
      Acts 2:36-38;   Romans 6:1-5;  Ephesians 2:19;  Acts 2:46-47<br/>
Then: Eph 2:4-5;  2 Cor 5:14-17  &amp; Romans 8:12-14; Eph 4:16<br/>
On that last day you can claim your reward: Romans 8:18<br/>

Welcome aboard!<br/>
Now, if we can find a way to connect with others who read the<br/>
Smiithsonian article, but havent (yet) acted upon their interest!  Glad<br/>

<br/>
Well, as regards to hiding boxes / littering, etc: I don't know if a<br/>
similar event has happened elsewhere, altho the e-groups archives for<br/>
LBNA have some thoughts about hiding. I suggest and (follow)these<br/>
guidlines, altho what one does is an individual choice:<br/>
<br/>
1) Keep a low profile (asking 'permission' means someone in 'authority'<br/>
has to decide if it is worth the 'administrative risk' even tho they<br/>
might personally be OK with it).<br/>
2) Affix an outside label explaining what it it (See "Getting Started" @<br/>
the web a page), as well as info inside for the uninitiated to take<br/>
home.<br/>
Again, indiviaual approaches vary - I alwlays include my tel. #, so, is<br/>
there ARE any problems with the box's presence, or with boxer's sloppy<br/>
non-stewardship, they can tell me to come get it. I'd rather know that<br/>
just have it destroyed/missing for unknown reasons.<br/>
3) Choice of where to place is proving to be critical:<br/>
	a) You don't want a "casual" (i.e., clueless) find if it can be avoided<br/>
- more likely for vandalism.<br/>
	b) No "destruction" should result from the hunt (i.e., torn apart stone<br/>
walls, holes in the ground, etc.). Think 'stewardship of the land', and<br/>
hope the box hunter will as well.<br/>
	c) I try to avoid if possible, places that will decompose over time<br/>
(stumps,etc) in favor of rocks that will hopefully stay in place for<br/>
several years. Many others don't seem to share this concern, I just know<br/>
that that, with hidden boxes hidden far and wide its more difficult to<br/>
keep returning to see if the stump has rotted yet and dumped the box...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the verbosity here - bad netiquette on my part. Nict to have<br/>
you on board.<br/>
