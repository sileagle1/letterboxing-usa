to the gathering, but with it happening just down the road I couldn't resist<br/>
popping in.  After all, with the bad weather, I figured it would take 20<br/>
minutes or so to say hello to the small handful of people in attendance, and<br/>
I'd be on the road in no time.  Wrong!  What a great turnout.  I should have<br/>
known that letterboxers wouldn't let a heavy mist stop them.  I dragged<br/>
myself away after an hour and a half knowing that I was missing out on a ton<br/>
of fun.  (I missed K Martha...waaaa!)<br/>
<br/>
I felt a bit awkward arriving alone to meet a group of total strangers, but<br/>
immediately felt at ease with this warm and inviting gang.  And it turns out<br/>
they weren't all strangers.  What a gas to find out that I knew Warrior<br/>
Woman!  I can't wait for her to come back to town next summer so we can get<br/>
together for some letterboxing fun.<br/>
<br/>
Many, many thanks to the event organizers.  And Alafair, I am in awe of your<br/>
artistry, both in your fantastic event stamps, and the gorgeous log book you<br/>
created.  I'm now determined to scrape up the gas money for the upcoming CT<br/>
event, and to stay the whole day!<br/>
