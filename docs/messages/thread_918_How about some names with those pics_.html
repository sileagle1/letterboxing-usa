&gt; I was just checking the LBNA site noticed the pictures and stamps from <br/>
&gt; the 1999 Vermont Letterboxing Convention. Pretty cool! How about some <br/>
&gt; names with the pictures for those of us in letterboxing impoverished <br/>
&gt; areas? I have only had the chance to meet a couple of letterboxers <br/>
&gt; personally (at a stamp convention down here last year). I am curious if <br/>
&gt; anyone in the pictures is one of the long time participants from back in <br/>
&gt; the early tumultuous days of the hobby here? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
Glad to provide some names for you. Most of the people present at our <br/>
Vermont gathering last November were definite or relative old-timers.<br/>

&gt; I was also pleased to see the link to the ILC site working again (since I <br/>
&gt; have the site back online). Much appreciated! Now that I have a little <br/>
&gt; time to work on it, hopefully there will soon be something new of <br/>
&gt; interest to see there. My time remains limited so it will primarily be <br/>
&gt; constructed as a folks can  add their own links and clues project. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Glad the link is working. I noticed that the link from your site to <br/>
Letterboxing North America has a glitch. Maybe it needs the www. at <br/>
the beginning? I can't tell.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Last year I mentioned that I had arranged to have my mother-in-law hide a <br/>
&gt; box in England for me. However I never got around to publishing the clues <br/>
&gt; (and I caught the deserved grief for my procrastination from the inlaws). <br/>
&gt; Sorry Graham :-( . I will be publishing the clues on the ILC site, <br/>
&gt; hopefully later this week when new features allow for that. I would also <br/>
&gt; be more than willing to let anyone else publish the clues anywhere they <br/>
&gt; wish. However I am not sure if it would be appropriate for the LBNA site, <br/>
&gt; as the Brits would probably be quite offended at the notion of England <br/>
&gt; being an extension of North America ;-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Look forward to seeing your clues. We will get across the pond at <br/>
some time, I have no doubt.<br/>

Ironically, the link to letterboxing.org from <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.com/links.html doesn't work :-)<br/>
(looks like the problem is a mix of absolute and relative links)<br/>
<br/>
Not that it matters really, letterboxing is about hunting for and discovering<br/>
things that aren't apparent, and that can of course mean the clues and <br/>
letterboxing sites as well ... with all the technology potentially at<br/>
our (and box hunters') disposal, I think we run the risk of taking some <br/>
of the charm out of the hobby ... but that's just me, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, enough editorializing :)<br/>

Yeah that is a screwup. It works now. Rather embarrassing. I had been <br/>
working on it because my links page is displayed in a frame and the LBNA <br/>
site apparently has been designed to wipe out the history in Navigator. <br/>
Consequently once someone clicked on that link in my site, you could <br/>
never get anything but the LBNA page by using the back and forward <br/>
buttons on the browser. I forgot I was trying to deal with that. I fixed <br/>
it by forcing the LBNA site to load a new browser window when the link <br/>
was displayed. Probably none of my business, but you might want to <br/>
consider whether you want the site to hose the history in Netscape, it <br/>
really aggravates a lot of people when they can't leave a site by using <br/>
the back button. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully no one will have to hunt your site from my link anymore ;-) It <br/>
should work now, tell me if there is a problem. Thanks.<br/>

That will be fixed soon.  (BTW, it doesn't actually hose the history -- to <br/>
avoid it, all one has to do is hold down the back button in netscape and <br/>
pick the site you want, but it can be annoying I suppose if you don't know<br/>
about that)<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, enough technology :-)<br/>
