&gt; I haven't heard of any problems with STATE and LOCAL parks<br/>
<br/>
I've heard it reported long ago that geocaching (and by extension, <br/>
letterboxing) is illegal in the state park systems of Georgia, North <br/>
Carolina, and the local park system of Boulder, CO.<br/>
<br/>
I've also heard it reported that the Pennsylvania park system is developing<br/>
"guidelines" on the activities.  Finally, its been reported, that as<br/>
of 2002, activities _other_ than hunting are "in some ways restricted"<br/>
on state game lands in PA (state game lands make up alot of acres in PA,<br/>
so this is a big deal to non-hunters, especially since hunting _is_<br/>
permitted in most PA state parks).<br/>
<br/>
Now you've heard it reported -- YMMV.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>
<br/>
PS - in the P &amp; F counting thread, one opinion I'll add is that an object<br/>
need not have clues to be considered a letterbox ... (but a logbook and<br/>
stamp are essential of course ...) ... and it of course may find you (or<br/>
plant you, I suppose :-) ... the interesting lawyerware in this thread <br/>
comes from revisions and things that move around, not so much from <br/>
identifying what counts initially -- IMHO anyway)<br/>

<br/>
As someone mentioned last time this topic came up, asking is always a<br/>
good idea - or at least research the rules for that particular<br/>
organization, if they are avaliable.  I don't think we should ever<br/>
assume that the placing of a box in a park is okay - even if others are<br/>
already placed there.  Bottom line is that the whatever<br/>
authority/organization oversees that piece of land is responsible for<br/>
it, and we should at least give them the respect of talking with them.<br/>
<br/>
If permission has not been sought prior to placing, then we should also<br/>
respects that authorities/organizations right to confiscate it. <br/>
Technically, it is there right to do so - and if we haven't ask then we<br/>
really don't have any right to complain or be irritated about it<br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
JMHO - YMMV,<br/>

                    <html><body>Remember that "Audubon" comprises many organizations. I work for Mass Audubon. We are independent from other state Audubons and also separate from National Audubon. I can say that our particular sanctuary is one of over 40 of Mass Audubon's and we have no problems with having letterboxes. I'm pretty sure that at least one other staffer in the state is doing letterboxing with camp kids. I have placed boxes at other sanctuaries,and I know there are boxes placed by others at other Mass Audubon sites. Each of our sites can dictate 'yes' or 'no' about what types of activities (within MAS' overarching policies - of no collecting, no fires, no pets etc). I would say that it is fine to ask permission, but that as long as there is no damage, no telltale signs of people frequenting an area ("leave no trace") and regular monitoring of your placed boxes, secretly placing them is probably also fine (Mind you, please don't take this as an official stance for Mass Audubon. I'm not sure what they would come out with as a policy if asked about it).
