                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Letterboxers,<br/>
I do not think Graham meant that we should make our letterboxes impossible to<br/>
find.  I think he meant that they should not be ''gimmees''.<br/>
<br/>
Many of our letterboxes (mine included) have been too easy to find.  I will<br/>
continue to dedicate a portion of my boxes to the kids, but I expect that kids<br/>
will find more enjoyment in placing boxes in their local neighborhoods for<br/>
their friends to find.  Children do not generally have the freedom to go off<br/>
on their own in search of letterboxes.  They need adult supervision getting<br/>
kids interested is to help them understand the concept and have fun with it.<br/>
Then, when they get older, they will want to  put out ''real'' letterboxes<br/>
that take some thinking to locate.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to agree with Tom Cooch when he insists that the ''bogeyman stalker''<br/>
does not exist.  If such villains have shown up in TX or elsewhere, they are<br/>
isolated incidents, not trends.  It is not for the sake of protection from<br/>
vandals that I favor challenging clues, but for the sake of making our hobby<br/>
more interesting.  Variety is the answer. Some boxes should be easy, others<br/>
moderate, and still others should be truly challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, KIDS are SMART !!!  When we were youngsters, most of us enjoyed<br/>
reading Encyclopedia Brown, the Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and even Sherlock<br/>
Holmes.  These mystery novels were not over our heads, but required us to use<br/>
our heads!!  We are not hiding Easter eggs... we are creating small mysteries<br/>
for clever eggs to solve.  Perhaps our kids will grow up smarter as a result.<br/>
<br/>
If you conceal your box beneath a grass plug, I agree that once the general<br/>
vicinity of the box has been determined, the exact location of the plug should<br/>
be clearly described.  But determining the vicinity is another case.  Make<br/>
them work (and think) for it!!  It is better to search for a box and fail,<br/>
only to return another day to try again, than to find a box that is so easy a<br/>
baby could have found it.  How much fun would golf be if the holes were two<br/>
meters across?  You wouldn't get much respect for being good at jumping<br/>
hurdles that were only one foot high!!  An image from a letterbox stamp is a<br/>
badge that doesn't just say ''I was there'', it says ''I figured it out!!''<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, I think we are debating over our individual perceptions of<br/>
the term ''cryptic''.  The example Dan gives is an excellent set of clues.<br/>
Mind you, compass readings, alone, are as cryptic as ancient Egyptian peasant<br/>
slang to the uninitiated.  Other passages in Dan't example seem cryptic to me,<br/>
such as ''passing the tulip towering and ahead walking 16 planks among seven<br/>
tulip sentinals,'' or ''eyes left and trek 308 degrees 109 paces to a tulip<br/>
and dual sycas. North 44 paces. The trolls have it, they took it up water.''<br/>
And throughout there is the bit about recording the dates and adding them up<br/>
for clues... This type of riddle-solving is exactly what we should be aiming<br/>
for.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one final note... I had always assumed that Thom's email address was a<br/>
reference to Letterbox USA and stood for ''This Country's Great Riddles And<br/>
Fun Xercise'' !!!<br/>
<br/>
Cryptically yours,<br/>

Wise words from my neighbor.  Someone else has said "what we gain too<br/>
easily we do not appreciate"... or something like that.  The first stamp<br/>
in Brown's Camp #1 was attained on the 3rd try!! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
now I feel really dull and boring with the real explanation.<br/>
