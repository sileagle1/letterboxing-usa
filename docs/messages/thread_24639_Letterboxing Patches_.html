aren't patches for letterboxing, a bit odd, and geeky?..seems like boy <br/>

don't they call attention to the hobby?<br/>

I have hiked/letterboxed with folks that wear 5-10 patches, while <br/>
boxing..on their backpack...doesnt that hurt stealthness?<br/>

Many hiking clubs have their own backpack patches and when asked, that's<br/>
what we say.<br/>
<br/>
"Hiking Clubs." Helps explain the reason we're where we are and the backpack<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">l would think that having the patches/badges that we have are pretty distinct. The do not at all seem to mean anything to someone from 'outside the hobby'.  Who but a letterboxer would see a patch with say, Madge holding up the world, or even the LbNA patch, on it and understand right away what it was.  People have wondered about a secret sign, signal, etc. to identify fellow Lbers on the trail.  It seems that patches would do the trick as long as they are obscure enough that only those who are familiar with them would approach.<br/>

As for the geekiness of it, I guess that's right.  When we told our <br/>
son and his wife about letterboxing, thinking they'd enjoy doing it <br/>
with their children, our daughter-in-law said, "You two are such <br/>
geeks."  She said it jokingly, but...  well, if the shoe fits.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Being an old hippie, I have always been a fan of patches. There were all over my jeans in the '70's. Cavers are also fond of patches and have them on our overalls, cave packs, etc. Hikers, Hasher, and all sorts of hobbies have patches. My hiking bag has letterboxing patches, caving patches, my favorite band patches and a nifty Red Hat patch, plus  a Smokey the Bear that I got at Great Falls with Sowsewbizzy while waiting to meet up with you a year or so ago!<br/>
<br/>
  I love my patches. Like my tattoes they all have special meanings for me, each and every one!<br/>
<br/>
  Geekiness is in the eye of the beholder I guess. But then I've never been one to give a fat rats patootie about whether someone thought I was cool or not. <br/>
<br/>
  I just like what I like. Stealthiness can be acheived even with a birghtly colored pack. It's more attitude and behavior rather that what you are wearing in my mind. <br/>

I have hiked/letterboxed with folks that wear 5-10 patches, while <br/>
boxing..on their backpack...doesnt that hurt stealthness?<br/>

I have no issue with them in general, but seems folks frown upon <br/>

&gt; I LOVE patches! My family buys a new patch for everywhere we visit and<br/>
&gt; everything we do. That's what we have instead of a scrapbook. As far as<br/>
&gt; letterboxing patches go, I think they sort of map out where we are in the<br/>
&gt; hobby - whether it's an F100 patch, or a regional patch, or a newboxers<br/>
&gt; patch - if we compare patches, we find differences and similarities that<br/>
&gt; show a common thread amongst ourselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as odd and geeky and boy-scout-like, I can't speak to that I guess.<br/>
&gt; I crashed hard last night after staying up most of Thursday night to finish<br/>
&gt; getting my stuff together for Cub Scout camp this weekend and staying up all<br/>
&gt; night Friday night helping to adress logistics for attendance at said camp<br/>
&gt; which far exceeded our anticipation, and then spending a long day yesterday<br/>
&gt; teaching 250 of my best friends and their moms how to make bug hats, and all<br/>
&gt; for a whopping paycheck of three square meals of camp food and - a patch!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is that odd and geeky? If it is, just call me...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have thought that also BullDawg, about the stealthy part anyway. <br/>
Lots of the patches don't actually say "letterboxing" on them, but<br/>
some do.  I think the NY, TN, and Blue Diamond patches do, but most of<br/>
the others don't.  <br/>
<br/>
I wear a fanny pack, so I already look dorky before I started putting<br/>
patches on it.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a natural fit for letterboxers to be honest, probably a<br/>
fair number of letterboxers could be classified as having a<br/>
"collecting" gene in there body, so getting patches as souvenirs of<br/>
groups or places as a way of "collecting" them makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I would think that most people who are opposed to lots of press<br/>
on letterboxing, if asked, would say they would prefer the hobby grow<br/>
by word of mouth, from one person to another.  Patches can only do<br/>
that I think.  Suppose I'm walking down a trail, and someone says to<br/>
me..."Cool patches, what do they mean?" I could make somthing up like<br/>
Mark says if there is reason to be sly, or you can begin an informed<br/>
coversation about letterboxing.  I don't see that the advertising that<br/>
a patch could bring to letterboxing would be damaging in this aspect.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's how I see it.<br/>
<br/>
So, go ahead and buy a Letterpod pathch (http://letterpod.podbean.com)<br/>
because it just says LPOD, it won't give you away (shameless plug).<br/>

You may want to resend the info so I will have everything right at hand. Sorry about the delay in posting them but things have been crazy the past 3 to 4 months here in Pineconeville!<br/>

 I love this. sure patches are Geeky but they are also great <br/>
conversation stsarters. I look forward to more folks getting into it <br/>
here in Colorado....More boxes to find!<br/>
<br/>
Hubby and I thought that it was also a good match FOR Boy Scouting. We <br/>
started a Venturing Crew that is specializing in Letterboxing, <br/>
Geocaching (forgive me) benchmarking and waymarking. It is a great way <br/>
to get youth and adults up off their derriers and out hiking. We are <br/>
all al lot more enthused about hiking when it involves 'The Hunt".<br/>
<br/>
Eventually there will be patches, stamps, coins and wooden nickles to <br/>
add to the fun. I can hardly wait for the youth to place their first <br/>
box.<br/>
