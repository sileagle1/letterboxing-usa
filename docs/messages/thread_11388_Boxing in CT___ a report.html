                    <html><body>Hello all!  What a wonderful day today was!  I wish I could have spent yesterday (Sat.) boxing too, since it was also wonderful!  Yesterday was All-State Concert day  here in CT, so I was conducting one of the bands (dress rehearsal in the AM, concert in the afternoon), so it was a LONG day!  Thankfully, today Butterfly and I were able to get out and box, finding the following boxes safe and sound:
<br/>
<br/>Little Dam Series (4)
<br/>
<br/>Yawbux Series (first two only... we didn't try to get #3 today since we didn't know if we would be able to get back up the hill..... bad knees and all.  We will try for #3 when they reroute the Narragansett Trail on the Wyassup Lake Road side.)
<br/>
<br/>Revolutionary Fire (Needs a new stamp pad.  The old one is so wet and inky!  We were covered in ink when we left)
<br/>
<br/>Amy's Sweet Valentine Mystery Box (we were only the second group to stamp in behind a certain duo who should remain nameless!!!!!)
<br/>
<br/>A great day for boxing!  I hope everyone gets out to these boxes soon!  Many have not been stamped into since July and September!!!!!!!!  
<br/>
<br/>Happy Trails!
