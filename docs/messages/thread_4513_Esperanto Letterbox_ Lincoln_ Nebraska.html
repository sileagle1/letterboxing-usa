Nebraska's "Prairie Peace Park" just west of Lincoln.<br/>
<br/>
The first is called the "Esperanto Letterbox" in honor of the <br/>
International Language.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is perfect for folks travelling through our beautiful <br/>
state along Interstate 80.<br/>
<br/>
Please visit the clues page at <br/>

*chuckle*  I have a friend who's from Nebraska who I always like to <br/>
tease.  Things like "so what's there to do in Nebraska besides watch <br/>
the grass grow and the cars rust?"  (And she'll reply--totally <br/>
straight-faced--"Cow tipping!")<br/>
<br/>
But I thought it was amusing you set up the box for people <br/>
traveling "through" your "beautiful" state.  Most people usually go <br/>
TO beautiful states, not travel through them!<br/>
<br/>
But this is so off topic, I'll shut up now.  =)  (One of these days, <br/>
though, I will make it to Nebraska!)<br/>

There are so many beautiful states in our country that folks would <br/>
never get anywhere if they didn't resolve to continue on through the <br/>
first beautiful one they encountered. :)<br/>
<br/>
No one outside of Nebraska can really tell you what's good about it.  <br/>
Actually, we kind of like it this way.  A motto that our state <br/>
officially uses for marketing is, "Nebraska: The Good Life."  <br/>
Unofficially, many residents might tack on to that, "And We're Not <br/>
Telling You Why." :)<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing your stamps in my log books.<br/>
<br/>
