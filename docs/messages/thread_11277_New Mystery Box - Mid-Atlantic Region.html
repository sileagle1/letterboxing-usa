Clues:<br/>
Garry sat on his barstool, downing his pint of Guinness and watching<br/>
Ireland kick the pants off of England in the football match he was<br/>
watching on the tele.  With victory a near certainty, his mind started<br/>
wandering.  He was thinking back on how it must've been for his fellow<br/>
Irishmen to immigrate to the States and how they fit in to the fabric<br/>
of life once they were here.  The warmth of the bar and the Guinness<br/>
were working their magic<br/>
<br/>
Seamus sat on his barstool, downing a pint of Guinness.  If it hadn't<br/>
have been for the kindness of his cousin the barkeep,Thomas Stack,<br/>
he'd have no pint at all.  With the famine and no work to be had<br/>
anywhere, there was nary a shilling in his pocket.  He downed his<br/>
glass, tipped his cap to Tom, and turned to leave.  Something on the<br/>
table caught his eye.  "What's this?" he thought.  It was a tattered<br/>
piece of paper that read "JOBS in America".  He grabbed the paper and<br/>
ran home. <br/>
<br/>
He read the paper to his 4 brothers. It promised free passage to<br/>
America, free room and board, a steady wage, whiskey money, and a job!<br/>
 It was too good to be true.  Three of them decided to make the<br/>
journey and booked travel on the next boat to the new world.<br/>
<br/>
Once in America, Seamus and his brothers worked their hands to the<br/>
bone.  The job they had been hired to do was difficult and dangerous.<br/>
 It was the type of work no local would do, nor would they allow their<br/>
valuable slaves to do it either.  Working in the swamps quickly led to<br/>
many of their countrymen's deaths, including one of Seamus' brothers.<br/>
 Yellow fever, malaria, and cholera wiped out over 10,000 of his<br/>
fellow Irishmen. <br/>
<br/>
Life wasn't all work and no play and Seamus found some time to walk<br/>
around the new city he called home.  Many more of his countrymen had<br/>
come to settle in his little section of the city between Camp Street<br/>
and the river.  By now, the Irish well outnumbered any other immigrant<br/>
population in the area.  He had come to befriend many of the local<br/>
screwmen working on the docks and they all indulged in a pint or two<br/>
at the corner bar when the Sherwin Williams/Glidden Paint factory<br/>
whistle signaled the end of the working day.  After spending their<br/>
money on Guinness and whiskey, Seamus, his brother, and his mates<br/>
would head back to the shotgun double house that they shared.<br/>
<br/>
As time would have it,  Seamus settled down, married, and had<br/>
children.  Lo and behold, one of his many children befriended a young<br/>
Irish orphan destined to be the originator of jazz music (some say). <br/>
Some of Seamus' descendants remained in their close knit community,<br/>
while others sewed their seeds far from home.  His relations back home<br/>
in Ireland have also come here to America to settle and prosper. <br/>
Today, sitting on one of his barstools<br/>
<br/>
Garry awakes to hear Marcus say in his thick Irish brogue, "You'll<br/>
have another pint now, won't you?  And this one is on Thomas."  Amy<br/>
hands him a plate of delicious Banana Cheesecake Beignets, a favorite<br/>
of local patrons, and says, "You should probably eat something also."<br/>
 The other bartenders, Claude and Marcus agree.<br/>
