  After visitng The Happy Birthday Box, I found this one.  Chuck <br/>
often provides  an opportunity for me to use my newly learned compass <br/>
reading skills. The contents were damp, despite the box being intact <br/>
and lid on tight. I replaced the ziplock bag with a spare I brought <br/>
along as the original was unzippable. The inkpad must have gotten wet <br/>
because it was a very soupy imprint when I stamped my log. Oh well.  <br/>
The stampings  are fun to have, but the hunt is what I crave! <br/>

Elaine, Thanks for reporting on Birthday for my daughter Pink <br/>
Trotters and on Dunham for me. We thank you for the bag replacements <br/>
and letting us know. We will stop down with a new box for birthday in <br/>
the next day too.  Leader of the Pack<br/>
