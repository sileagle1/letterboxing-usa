                    <div class="plaintext-content">A short while ago I received a note from a writer for the LA Times. <br/>
She also posted a note on the SoCal list wanting an interview from <br/>
letterboxers that have been in the hobby for 10 years. She advised <br/>
that she had done quite a bit of research, but since she was looking <br/>
for someone with a 10 year track record I knew that she really hadn't <br/>
done her homework.<br/>
<br/>
I have a basic distrust of reporters and that had more to do with the <br/>
way I handled her request than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote her back in my regular tactless cut to the chase method and <br/>
advised her why I wouldn't participate by being interviewed. I did <br/>
emphasize that there had been other poorly written articles and <br/>
challenged her to see if she could really capture the nuances and <br/>
stealth that letterboxing needs.<br/>
<br/>
The article did appear in a Sunday suppliment, and to my surprise was <br/>
very good and did contain quite a bit of information regarding <br/>
secrecy and stealth.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you can get your point across by not participating, but you <br/>
should always tell the reporter why.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that most reporters could careless about <br/>
letterboxing, as they only care about selling the story to their <br/>
editor. The editor only cares about selling papers.<br/>

Talk about an oxymoronic statement!  lol<br/>

How did letterboxing ever grow and evolve in that period of time <br/>

<br/>
I'm trying to figure out which part is oxymoronic?<br/>
<br/>
Sunday suppliment? (which usually is huge and a paper onto itself)<br/>
<br/>
Don's surprise? (even the great BSer can be surprised)<br/>
<br/>
The article was very good? (That is a stretch for a conservative when <br/>
it comes to the LA Times)<br/>
<br/>
quite a bit of information regarding secrecy and stealth? (how else <br/>
can they be discussed)<br/>
<br/>
My note to the writer was less than agreeable as I took the time to <br/>
list many non letterboxing reasons why I distrust reporters. Most of <br/>
those come from a lifetime of keeping clients' secrets away from <br/>
reporters prying eyes. Also other times having first hand knowledge <br/>
how things get twisted when the press was furnished information.<br/>
While I mean no disrepect to the present reporter in this topic <br/>
there "can be" a slant to any reporter's story.<br/>
<br/>
In the case I cited it seems as though the reporter used many of <br/>
the "fears" I had included in my note and ended up writing a better <br/>
story, or at least one that covered the sneakiness needed in <br/>
letterboxing. While I agree with the majority here that the best <br/>
story might be one that stays unwritten, never the less, if I had not <br/>
sent the reporter my note the story would have been written without <br/>
my input.<br/>
I do think that my note had an impact and she did not include our <br/>
names in the article as I had requested.<br/>

it struck me as funny to hear of an article published in a newspaper <br/>
that I assume to have large readership describing the secrecy and <br/>
stealth part of letterboxing while also telling everyone about it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad, however, that your note to the journalist helped to ensure <br/>
that the secrecy and stealth were at least mentioned.  I do agree, <br/>
however, that the best article about letterboxing is the one not <br/>
written.<br/>
<br/>
Oh if I ruled the world...  LOL<br/>
