<div>We found boxes #3 and #4, but as has been posted #1 is missing and it 
appears that #2 is missing now as well (unless we are completely inept...which 
wouldn't be too much of a stretch!)  Boxes #3 and #4 are both in great 
condition.</div>

<div>It was yet another gorgeous hike that we wouldn't have ever stumbled upon 
without Letterboxing!</div>
