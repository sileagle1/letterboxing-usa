<div>Today Odillio &amp; myself decided to go out and be 
festive by finding all the CHristmas boxes in the northeast part of CT. 
Actually French Fox, Ladybug98, &amp; Rosiebunny started with us but there was 
too much snow for their little legs (by little legs I mean Rosie &amp; Ladybug, 
that was not comment about your height French Fox - haha) </div>
<div>What a challenge boxing in the 
snow!!! </div>
<div>We went to  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Under the Pines in Mansfield -The boughs were 
frozen to the ground so it took us a while. Box was in good condition 
                
                
        but it will need a new journal 
soon.</div>
<div>The Three Magi - Lots of people skiing here! Good 
condition. Nice, easy hunt.</div>
<div>Secret Santa - Great hunt. Beautiful 
spot.</div>
<div>Special Snowflake - This is where the snow became a 
REAL challenge. It is hard to find the right stone on a stonewall that is 
                
                
covered with snow. Funny story. We had a goat follow us for a while. I 
guess he thought Odillio's walking stick was     
                
    a staff and Odillio was his shepardess. Then the snow 
became too deep for the goat and he gave us a look like we     
                
    were insane to continue and he wandered off.</div>
<div>Then Odillio hadn't found </div>
<div>Silent Night WWI or </div>
<div>Christmas Around the World (which French Fox 
&amp; I hid) so we did those as well. In fact two nice men helped us out of snow 
drift              
            that we parked in. 
OOPS!  </div>
<div>All in all what a great day boxing - putting 
us in a Christmas mood!</div>

<p>I think that yesterday was the best day letterboxing yet.   Irishtinker and I had tons of fun and lots of laughs.   We listened to Christmas music in the car and even sang a couple as we trudged through the snow.  </p>
<p>If someone told me this time last year that I would be hiking in the snow I wouldd have thought they were crazy.  But boy was it worth it.  I am just shy of my 100th find (I have 94).  I can't wait to get out there again. </p>
<p>The snow brings unique challenges like parking in the snow!! I dedicated the rest of my hike to the two nice men who pushed us out of the snow bank at "Christmas around the world".   They were so nice about it but did have to tell me that my Civic is not a snowmobile LOL.</p>
<p>All the stamps we found were beautiful and the stories were great.  I hope you all find these during the Christmas season.  Merry Christmas and Happy Hunting!!   Odilio<br/></p></blockquote><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>
