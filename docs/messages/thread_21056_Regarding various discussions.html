Hi, <br/>
I usually lurk on this site, but I have met some of you at recent events.  I have been letterboxing for 1 1/2 years (P7, F167, X181, V23 ) and I have a few thoughts regarding various recent threads on this group.  Before the events, I did not even know about this yahoo group (ok so I live in a cave); and before this site, I did not know there was a problem with store bought stamps.  I personally am in it for the hunt, and don't worry about what the stamp looks like as long as it follows the theme of the box.  I do believe that the theme should be followed.  After reading everything here, I may begin carving, but I still love my store bought personal stamp (which is a witch... and is appropriate at times.... :)   ). I have alot of respect for those who do carve, but my mother is the artist, not me!!  As someone discussed, I thought that the only rules were that there are no rules.  I believe it is just great to get out and see places that I would not have, and find a box to boot!  <br/>
Okay, back to lurking, and I hope I have not offended anyone!!<br/>
Have great letterboxing day....<br/>

You have echoed my sentiments exactly.  I have been boxing a little<br/>
over a year and happily used my store bought stamp and admired the<br/>
hand made ones in the boxes that I found but never thought about<br/>
carving my own.  I had no clue that hand carved stamps were more<br/>
desirable until I found this message board three months ago and<br/>
learned that I was committing a faux pas.  I quickly devoured any and<br/>
all articles I could find on hand carving and did indeed begin carving<br/>
my own and found that I enjoyed it and am slowly improving.  However,<br/>
as Carole stated, not every letterboxer reads these message boards so<br/>
they may not know how important it is to  more avid letterboxers that<br/>
the stamp be hand carved.  I think most of us might agree that the<br/>
search is the goal and the stamp is just the icing on the cake and for<br/>
me it doesn't make any difference if the icing came out of a can or<br/>
from our own recipe.<br/>

Well, my two cents,<br/>
I must confess I don't like icing from a can. I like it homemade. I<br/>
don't buy or eat cakes from Costco.<br/>
Long ago I sparked discussion that led to the question of whether<br/>
letterboxing was a hobby or a sport and I think that it is different<br/>
things to different people. I for one, love the merging of treasure<br/>
hunting and art. I also love connecting with people who have been<br/>
there before me and if I see a hand carved stamp it enhances two out<br/>
of the three top reasons that I letterbox. While I am somewhat of a<br/>
stamp snob, I think it only extends to whether you carved the stamp<br/>
yourself or not. I don't care if you are good at it, though I can<br/>
appreciate a great carver it is not the most important thing for me. I<br/>
far prefer a beginner carving job over a commercial stamp anytime! It<br/>
feels like you left a little piece of yourself in the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
But since some people don't care, I wish that people would list on<br/>
their clue sheet whether the stamp is hand-carved or not. Then those<br/>
that care could choose to go or not and would not feel that slight<br/>
disappointment of a storebought stamp that can happen to us poor stamp<br/>
snobs.<br/>
<br/>
Nisha<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On another note I wish that someone would put together a beginning<br/>
carving kit that people could buy through the list, since I think many<br/>
people want to start carving but don't have the tools handy.  I have<br/>
thought about it many times but somehow just don't have the energy to<br/>
pull it together.<br/>

If you use AtlasQuest (http://www.atlasquest.com) you can make<br/>
'hand-carved' one of the criteria of your search, so you never have to<br/>
see another commercial stamp again!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Nicely put, Carole.  My sentiments exactly.  I used a store bought stamp of a Kokopelli when I first started letterboxing a year ago, then I saw that someone else was using the same one, so I bought another.  The same thing happened again.  After letterboxing for 1 year, I decided to print an image of him off the internet and carve my own so that I would have one that no one else had.  Anyone seeing the stamp would probably think it was store bought.  My apologys to those people, but I love my stamp.  I also respect anyone who takes the time to plant a letterbox whether the stamp is hand carved or not.  My feeling is that "It's the thought that counts".<br/>

http://www.stampeaz.com/index.php?main_page=index&amp;cPath=12<br/>
