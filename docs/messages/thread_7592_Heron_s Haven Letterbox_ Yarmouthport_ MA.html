We had a bit of trouble and even got back in the car and drove around <br/>
some more to make sure we were parked in the right spot because the <br/>
clues didn't seem to match the terrain.  We were parked in the right <br/>
place after all and after a bit more perseverence and process of <br/>
elimination, we found it.  It is a nice stamp.<br/>
