Great Camp Sagamore is a National Historic Landmark and an official project of Save America's Treasures.   It was built beginning in 1897, and soon became the summer retreat of the Vanderbilt family.  This was an almost self-sufficient camp, with an upper and lower complex for workers of the camp and the guests and family of the Vanderbilts.  Great Camp Sagamore is owned by a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to the preservation of this great camp.   Two-hour guided tours of the camp are given twice daily during the summer (10:0o and 1:30),   Closed during the winter.  Admission (2002 prices) are $10 for adults, $3 for children.  For more information, go to www.sagamore.org  Numerous hiking trails can be found around Sagamore, all which are on State Forest land.    <br/>

was thrilled to find a last minute letterbox placement. I've driven <br/>
through Raquette lake (the village, not the lake) countless times and <br/>
never knew that Sagamore was there. Visited the box one week after it <br/>
was planted and hiked on to see the namesake Beaver Flow, all very <br/>
enjoyable. We look forward to seeing more Adirondack boxes.<br/>
