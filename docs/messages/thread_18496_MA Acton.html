&gt;is Mac Attack and she's from Stratford, CT. I don't know how she has been <br/>
&gt;living in CT for her entire life and has never heard of letterboxing. What <br/>
&gt;makes it worse is that we met when we were roommates at Quinnipiac College, <br/>
&gt;which is across the street from Sleeping Giant, home of about 87,172,583 <br/>
&gt;boxes. :)<br/>
OH MY GOSH!  That is where I went to college too!  I graduated back in <br/>
1980 YIKES!<br/>
I never knew about letterboxing back then.<br/>
