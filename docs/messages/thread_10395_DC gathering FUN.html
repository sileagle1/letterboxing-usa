I just wanted to thank everyone who came to the DC gathering this past weekend.  I had a blast.  The turnout was more than I could have ever hoped for.  It was so fun to FINALLY put faces with the names and stamps that I have become familiar with over the past few months.  The day was just one more reminder of why I love this quirky little hobby!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Squirrel for her excellent recap of the day!<br/>
<br/>
Also, it was a treat to have our guest from CT - Darrin.  We all got to sneak a peek at his log book and see some of the famous CT stamps.  I am dying to take a trip up there someday and find some of these treasures for myself.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, there was much discussion about having an East Coast gathering in the spring or summer.  All us DC folks would love to meet more of you northerners!<br/>
