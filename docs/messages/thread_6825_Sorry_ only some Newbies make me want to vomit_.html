I should have titled the post:<br/>
<br/>
Some Newbies make me want to vomit.<br/>
<br/>
My point is, some people come into an established activity and within a week<br/>
they seem to think it all has to be changed to their way. I have seen more<br/>
attempts to change NA Letterboxing and the list in the last month than in<br/>
the last year and a half. It wouldn't be so bad except most of the changes<br/>
have nothing to do with Letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry it was interpreted as HATING ALL NEWBIES!<br/>
<br/>
A few of these Newbies should learn what tha hobby is before they try and<br/>
change it.<br/>
<br/>
How outrageous, right?<br/>
