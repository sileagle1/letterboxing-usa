Hi all,<br/>
I am curious about how many people will end up finding the entire<br/>
series, and just how many boxes people end up with if not finding<br/>
every one. The letterbox senders must be VERY curious!!<br/>
So, the week on Nov. 1st, please e-mail me with your final tallies.<br/>
I'll post the results on the talklist and also submit the numbers to<br/>
Chuck for his webpage. It'll be a basic count, such as so-and-so many<br/>
people found them all, so-and-so many people found 75 to 100. Well,<br/>
you get the point.<br/>
May The Force be with you.<br/>
Catlover/gardener/teacher..plodding along with a pitifully low<br/>
MMM "found" count so far (loving this glorious fall weather though)<br/>
