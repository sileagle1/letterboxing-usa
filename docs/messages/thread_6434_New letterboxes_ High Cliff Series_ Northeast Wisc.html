<div>-High Cliff Series</div>
<div>-Planted in High Cliff State Park</div>
<div>-Sunday, July 21, 2002</div>
<div>High Cliff is located in Calumet County, Wisconsin. Nearest 
town-Sherwood.  High Cliff State Park is approx. 30 miles southwest of 
Green Bay or 12 miles east of Appleton</div>
<div>-Hiking-moderate, some climbing</div>
<div>-Submitted by Esperanza</div>
<div>-A series of three boxes have been hidden on a trail loop of 
approx 3 miles.  The park is located on the shores of Lake Winnebago with 
great views from the top of the cliff and the overlook tower in the park.  
The hike is family-orientated and would take a leisurely 2 - 3 hours, depending 
on stops and exploring time. There is a marina in the park, a beach for 
swimming and a campground. There is a user fee of $4, or a yearly sticker 
may be purchased.  Picking up a park/trail map at the entrance to the park 
is recommended.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The hike begins on the Lime-Kiln trail which starts in the 
paved parking lot by the lime kiln ruins.  The trail will pass several old 
kiln structures.  The path will fork to the left, but stay to the right and 
follow along the lake.  You'll reach a second place where the trail forks 
and this time there is a sign.  Again stay to the right and follow the lake 
on the Long Loop portion of the trail.  The trail passes over small streams 
that are heading to the lake and some very large cottonwood trees.  The 
trail will take a left turn at a bench and begin to ascend up the cliff.  
Take a rest and enjoy the view and then begin the climb!  As you ascend, on 
your right are several large boulders and a huge tree.  As you ascend past 
its roots count the steps...5 steps and then roots...8 steps and then 4 
more.  Take 8 paces and then look to your right to find a "family" trunked 
tree (2 large trunks + 2 babies)  Go up the little hill to the back of this 
tree.  With your back to the largest trunk, take a bearing of 150 degrees 
on your compass and find the rock across the woods that looks like Mount 
Everest.  It sticks out of the ground about 3' in an inverted V 
shape.  (From the tree it's approx. 12 paces to the log, step over the log 
and then about 25 paces from the log to the rock)  On the south side of the 
rock is a tree whose roots hug the rocks...find the box!  As you head back 
you'll notice a natural path heading to the south, a trail for the creature on 
the stamp you've just found.  Back on the main trail, continue to ascend up 
the cliff.  Once at the top you are near the campground and you are now on 
the Red Bird Trail.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box #2 - head northeast on the Red Bird trail.  It will 
pass the Indian Mound trail which is interesting.  This trail follows 
the ridge of the cliffs, parents be sure to watch children closely!  The 
trail will pass by the edge of an old quarry which will be on your right.  
After the quarry, the trail passes near a park road and enters a more wooded 
area.  Soon the trail will ascend to cross the road, but before it does, 
stop at the spot where the stream passes under the trail and follow the stream 
down to where it opens out into a small "canyon". Cross the stream and take a 
seat on the rock sticking out of the wall near the edge, with your feet on the 
3rd "step" of rock.  A small waterfall is at your feet.  Put your 
right hand on your thigh and then notice the set of smaller rocks by your right 
hand.  They can move...after finding the box please also replace the old 
pop can diversion as well!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box #3  Continue back on the main trail, which will cross 
the park road and continue to follow the edge of the cliff up to another part of 
the park and the statue to Chief Red Bird on your left.  The trail will 
come out to a parking lot, pavilion and a lookout tower.  After exploring 
this part of the park, the trail continues at the edge of the parking lot, and 
it descends now down the cliff.  Half of the trail is blacktopped and was 
an old road, the other side is gravel.  Follow this down until you reach 
the bench on the left hand side.  Take the path behind the bench up into 
the woods and up the side of the cliff.  On the way up you'll pass two 
large boulders on your left, and then you'll cross over a series of small 
boulders, and over a fallen tree.  After the fallen tree there are two 
trees side-by-side on the trail.  Stand between them and take a compass 
bearing of 170 degrees, the bearing is pointing right to the box in the rocky 
"cave".  Continue back to the main trail and descend to the road.  
Cross over and walk back to the Lilm-Kiln trail parking 
lot.</div></body></html>
