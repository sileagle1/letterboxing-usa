                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I had the opportunity to go letterboxing with Kayak Lil' and Star Polisher whom I had met the day before. Very nice ladies I might add and a wonderful day of letterboxing. They visited most of my letterboxes in Harrison and some of the boxes across the border in Indiana. It was fun to watch them find my letterboxes and it gave me a chance to do box maintenance &amp; to see where clues needed to be clarified or changed. I'll update the clue pages with info on when they were last found &amp; the clue changes where applicable. Here's the list:<br/>
<br/>
IN MIAMI WHITEWATER FOREST:<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter Box #2 &amp; #3- A really huge tree fell right over the hiding spot for Box #2. I had a heck of a time climbing under/around branches to retrieve it! Since the "landmarks" to find it are no longer visible, I changed the "entrance Spell" so that the box could be moved to a safer location. The new spell can be found hand written in the log book for box #1 (clues for box #3 will get the addition of three words to make it a bit more clear- follow the trail past the Paw Paws UP AND AROUND. Remember to note that it is farther than you think). Since the clues for Box #2 &amp; #3 are found only INSIDE box #1, I'll also re-print them in proper form and place the new ones when I get a chance. <br/>
<br/>
Found safely in place: Harry Potter 1,3,4 (2 is now safe as well), Mad Dawg's Purple Mtn Majesty, Witch Way, In honor of, The Giant, and Franzsolo's Badlands Trail. On the Oak Leaf Trail: Colorful Castle and Pileated were in place, but I'll be replacing the box for Pileated, since it was badly chewed. On Tall Grass Prairie Trail: Happy Dog 1 &amp; 2 and Franzsolo's bonus box were fine.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Dog #2 is gone. I'll note that in the clues and re-carve a better stamp for this one. Good news is that I had just replaced the log books, so I have the full log book from this box and the stamp had been one of my early (crude) carvings :-)<br/>
<br/>
IN HARRISON, OHIO:<br/>
Lil and Pati were very observant when trying to find "The Truth" and pointed out several very similar stones with the same name on them along the road mentioned in the clues. Clues will be updated to read :"The tall monument to Simonson, just 5 steps off the road, near Ingalls". I was going to leave it just as "5 steps off the road" but there are two that fit THAT description and at least three tall monuments to Simonson that look very similar :-) All the others in/around this cemetery were found on Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
IN INDIANA:<br/>
We found the church boxes and two of the three by the Guilford covered bridge "Sunday Drive &amp; Picnic" series. The one by Tanners Creek is gone (I'll re-carve and try to find a more secure place for it). <br/>
