Special Use Permit...<br/>
<br/>
This is also the method I have used in Ohio at the John Bryan State <br/>
Park.  There is a requirement not to leave the paths in John Bryan <br/>
because of the sensitivity of some of the plants isolated there by <br/>
the special environment.  <br/>
<br/>
An agreement was reached with the park manager to locate all <br/>
letterboxes within 10 feet of a trail or maintained area.  I moved <br/>
all boxes which were further from the paths than that and put them in <br/>
agreeable locations.  With 10 miles of trails, that did not crowd the <br/>
boxes too close together.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, it has worked pretty well - even with the whole valley of <br/>
frogs series (27) plus an additional 4 or 5 boxes located in the <br/>
park.  <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the managemnt of the Audubon Society area may be open <br/>
to an adult presentation of the risks and benefits of allowing <br/>
letterboxing.  Perhaps attending a meeting of the volunteer staff <br/>
(with the carefully nurtured support of an influential member) would <br/>
turn this situation around.  It is amazing what can happen when <br/>
inteligent adults sit down together instead of corresponding with an <br/>
imagined evil by email.  It's a lot harder to see the other person as <br/>
the enemy when looking into their eyes.    <br/>
<br/>
There is a little shock to the system which occurs when called into a <br/>
manager's office.  Adrenalin is a powerful drug, and I made enough to <br/>
fuel a generator when told "if you remove all the boxes we will not <br/>
press charges."  But the great news is that there are a lot of <br/>
rational adults out there working to enhance, protect, and clean up <br/>
the natural areas open to the public.  Most of the managers of the <br/>
areas we like to plant boxes in are in that category.  <br/>
<br/>
My simple (simplistic) advice is to ask permission first whenever <br/>
possible, to occasionally beg forgiveness, and to represent <br/>
letterboxing as a safe activity involving a few visitors, most of <br/>
whom carry out a sack of garbage collected from the trail whenever <br/>
they go looking for a letterbox. <br/>

&gt; &gt; don't think defying them will accomplish anything but ill will. I<br/>

I do a lot of trail running and God help me if they see me "jogging" on one<br/>
of their trails. They politely point out the signs prohibiting such abuse of<br/>
the land, and then ask for my receipt to prove I paid to use the trails.<br/>
Yeah, when my car is eleven miles away!<br/>
