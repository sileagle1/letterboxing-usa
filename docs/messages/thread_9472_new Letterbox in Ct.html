The Bears Gift<br/>
<br/>
The story:<br/>
Bears are big, their presence is big even in the wild. They travel long<br/>
distances and gain respect for their knowledge of nature.<br/>
Our Bear is gentle and kind, she will give you a gift when you find her<br/>
hiding place. If you feel her energy you may want to look up some bear <br/>
facts in<br/>
the library.<br/>
<br/>
The Clues: A reflection of Life.<br/>
Begin this quest at the parking lot on Mt Carmel Ave in Hamden in the<br/>
Sleeping Giant State Park. Pick up a map for any continuing hiking and<br/>
letterboxing you may wish to hunt..<br/>
Find the trail of purity that you may already know!! Climb the rocky<br/>
path perhaps reminding yourself of the childhood climb into the teen years.<br/>
Reach the Tower Trail, and walk the smooth restful way continuing on the <br/>
path<br/>
of purity which very soon turns right , back into the rocky life of the<br/>
teen years. Climb over the many rocks in your path as you reach for the <br/>
learning<br/>
years of young adulthood. Soon climb the stairs, rocky though they are, and<br/>
arrive at the well-spring . The choice to be made-- left looks smoother <br/>
and the<br/>
color of Blue. But stay pure in your thoughts as you climb to the top. <br/>
Age makes<br/>
no difference now. Here on the Giants shoulder is a amazing sight. A <br/>
clump or Forsythia<br/>
growing and it is a mystery how it got here. In the spring this spot is <br/>
a blaze of gold.<br/>
Stand here at the top and close by, find two white blazes painted on the <br/>
rock. Go stand<br/>
there and face due north. A lone Cedar is on the left. Notice a white <br/>
blaze on the rock<br/>
straight ahead. Walk to that blaze. Now carefully take 7 or 8 steps on a <br/>
bearing of 320<br/>
degrees to find an iron eye bolt in a rock. From there look 140 degrees <br/>
into the forsythia<br/>
bushes for the gift of the bear .<br/>
This box is planted with Love in honor of Bear on her very special <br/>
birthday. Happy<br/>
Birthday Bear and many more<br/>
