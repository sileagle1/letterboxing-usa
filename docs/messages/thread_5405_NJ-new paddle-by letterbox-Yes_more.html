First to stamp into the "Upper Batsto River" letterbox<br/>

Well, I bet you didn't know there's been a geocache right where<br/>
you take out of the water for the Upper Batsto River letterbox.<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.asp?ID=15802<br/>
The directions are as follows: <br/>
After you take-out of the Batsto River as described in the <br/>
"Upper Batsto River" directions, you are on the west side of <br/>
Quaker Bridge. There are a series of short telephone poles<br/>
along the right side (south), leading up to the bridge. The<br/>
cache is located between the 2cd and 3rd pole, covered with<br/>
pine needles. Small log book to stamp into, but no stamp.<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
There are 3 more placed along the mullica. <br/>

Feel free to stamp into any if you wish. Maybe I should<br/>
place a few hybrids. We do both,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>Actually, we did.  While we were hidding our letterbox and waiting for some of our group to get the cars from the ranger station we met 3 geocahers who were looking for a cache very near, or actually under, the bridge.  They were unsuccessful.  Whether they were looking for a different one, or just in the wrong place, I don't know.
<br/>
<br/>As for the Mullica,  we do a weekend paddle every late September/early October and camp out 1 night on the Mullica.  We hope to hide a letterbox or two before then, but if not, there'll be one planted that weekend for sure.  I'll have to check the website for the locations of the geocaches. 
<br/>
<br/>Thanks, Tom.
