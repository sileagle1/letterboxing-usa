The Eager Beaver Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Date placed: 10/28/01<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy - good for children<br/>
<br/>
Time: About 45-60 minutes, round trip.<br/>
<br/>
Starting Location: Station Rd parking lot, Norwottuck Rail Trail, <br/>
Amherst, MA<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
 From Downtown Amherst, proceed south on MA 116. About  1/4  mile <br/>
past the traffic light at the Fort<br/>
River bridge, take a left onto Shays St. Proceed through first Stop <br/>
sign, and take a <br/>
left onto South East St (in front of a church). Before the Common <br/>
ends, take<br/>
a right onto Station Rd. The parking lot is 1 mile on the left, just <br/>
before the railroad tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
<br/>
Head north on the rail trail. Soon you will notice a wetland on your <br/>
right...The Eager Beaver<br/>
has been known to frequent these waters. The wetland gives way to a <br/>
larger pond, containing a<br/>
beaver dam adjacent to the trail. After walking another couple of <br/>
minutes, note a sign that  states<br/>
"Brickyard Conservation Area" , and the junction of a trail on the <br/>
right...leave the Rail Trail here.<br/>
<br/>
This trail can get muddy. Cross a single plank bridge, and shortly <br/>
thereafter look for a birdhouse <br/>
on the right. There is a paved area containing some rusted metal <br/>
objects on the right, as the trail veers left. After a few minutes of <br/>
walking down this birch-lined path, there will be a junction with<br/>
the Ken Cuddeback  ("K.C.") trail..take a left onto this blue-blazed <br/>
path, and start counting paces. At 125 paces, there is an unmarked <br/>
trail heading off to the right. Follow it, while starting to count<br/>
paces again. While pacing, you'll note the abandoned brick building <br/>
that appears in front of you, formerly a brickworks (surprise!).<br/>
At 60 paces, stop. Note the singular evergreen tree to your left. The <br/>
Eager Beaver is hiding beneath this tree, under a human made object. <br/>
<br/>
After stamping in , return to the Ken Cuddeback trail. You can return <br/>
via the same route by taking a left here. Or, take a right,  which <br/>
will lead you over several bog bridges back to the Rail Trail.   Take <br/>
a left to head head back to the parking lot.<br/>

The first of (hopefully) several boxes placed by the L Troop. Comments<br/>
or suggestions appreciated!<br/>
