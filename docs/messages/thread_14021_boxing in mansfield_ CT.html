                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello,<br/>
I went boxing in Mansfield CT yesterday with Freedom Fox and Irishtinker and  newbie "Licks" <br/>
We did the Pink Panther Series, Totem Pole, Air Mail (A new favorite!!), The Wizard Series, The Circle of Life Series, Merrow Park Box, and Friendly Skies. We missed one box in Merrow Park because the heat was getting to us.<br/>
<br/>
Irish Mum your Totem Pole box is broken but the contents are okay.<br/>
<br/>
We loved all the boxes and had a great time.  We definately have a new convert to letterboxing with Licks.  Irishtinker carved a very cool personal stamp for him.<br/>
<br/>
 This was Irishtinker and Freedom Fox 1 year anniversary!!  Freedom Fox hit a milestone but I'll let him tell you about it!!<br/>
<br/>
Extra nice bonus of meeting Teach and Preach for an exchange!!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail!!<br/>
Odilio<br/>
Thank you to all the planters for a great day!!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was great running into Odilio, "Licks", Irishtinker, and Freedom <br/>
Fox at Kathy Johns.  We went to let the kids stamp the KJ Letterbox <br/>
but it was no longer in the spot it was.  So, with two new exchanges <br/>
it was well worth it anyways.  Odilio, we have seen your stamp in <br/>
many logbooks and we are thankful to get an exchange with you.  <br/>
Irishtinker all your carvings are GREAT!!!!!  I want to cry looking <br/>
at my carving after looking at yours LOL... just kidding.  "Licks", <br/>
sounds like you had a great time.  I started letterboxing for my wife <br/>
and I'm more into letterboxing than her now.  Freedom Fox has a box <br/>
in Brooklyn that if your familier with the T.V. show Alice, you will <br/>
laugh when you look at the stamp.  I thought it was awesome.  <br/>
Everyone stay cool.  Dan of Teach &amp; Preach<br/>
