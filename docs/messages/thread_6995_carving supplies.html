                    <div class="plaintext-content">hello all,<br/>
at this point, i am embarrased to state, but i work for michaels. <br/>
personally, i TRY to help people find things, or refer the people to <br/>
staff who might know the specific merchandise better. i am terribly <br/>
sorry for all the bad experiences, and i dont own stock. its just <br/>
sad. now that i know where to go to find the sku numbers, i will <br/>
bother my manager to carry more than the one beginner kit (piece of <br/>
rubber, scary tool handle and 2 blades for $10...)<br/>
<br/>
as for FINDING the carving meduim...<br/>
it is most likely in the art department near the oil paints and such. <br/>
next row over, maybe. being made by speedball it should be grouped <br/>
near their calligraphy merchandise, and to date, the company i <br/>
believe considers it "lineoleum carving" materials, which is a <br/>
dissapearing old school art form. like silk screen printing. on the <br/>
same row should be the magic rub and stadeler erasers, which i have <br/>
had much success with. magic rub is cheaper. dollar tree carries <br/>
rubber erasers, 6 to a package, in neon colors which work <br/>
exceptionally well, it is just a hassle to find them. i have been in <br/>
3 stores and only 1 had 'em. they are slightly thinner.<br/>
<br/>
and if you are in the area....<br/>
the chesapeake bay artist's association is holding their annual <br/>
outdoor art show this weekend, 10 to 6 saturday 17th and 12 to 6 <br/>
sunday 18th. if you have seen the ov letterbox or plan to visit, it <br/>
would be a good time to drop by. you will know my exhibit by what i <br/>
am showing... and if you show me my stamp in your book i will give <br/>
you a signed  OV one. untill i run out, that is. i was gonna try to <br/>
sell it, but decided that it was REALLY BAD ETHICS.... so i made 6 <br/>
more specifically to sell but not plant. after the art show i will <br/>
get back to planting stamps. and i am from the old school, i consider <br/>
it linoleum carving when in rubber. in wood is woodcarving. feels <br/>
more artsy than "stamp", which is what both are anyway.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, good luck finding medium, when i get out to pembroke i will <br/>
write down those sku numbers and post them so all yall can tell the <br/>
store managers specifically what you want them to carry. sorry for <br/>
all the grief,<br/>

I bought a package of these neon erasers last week and love them! They carve<br/>
quite nicely, and at six for a dollar, they are perfect for boxes. Mars<br/>
Staedtler MasterCarve is, of course, The Best, but is the highest price of<br/>

Dollar Tree neon erasers.  I was actually out there last night and came<br/>
across these gems!  Hadn't even seen these posts until this morning.<br/>
Six for a dollar and they do carve extremely well.  I plan on going back<br/>
there today and buy as many as I can get my hands on (or have enough<br/>
money for - which won't be much since I only have $6 in my pocket<br/>
today).  They are the perfect size for letterboxing and gift-giving to<br/>
that favorite carver of yours!  <br/>

Just to let you know Spike.  wehn I was in the pembroke store I <br/>
happened to grab a manager type person I think.  She was about <br/>
5'10 with long blonde hair and she was hanging out in the <br/>
scrapbooking section.  She was very nice and very helpful.  She <br/>
looked a bit rushed but I didnt mind.<br/>

I found similar neon erasers at Big Lots here in the Pacific <br/>
Northwest.  They were 3 for around $0.50.  I think Big Lots here is <br/>
similar to MacFrugals in other areas of the US.  I also found really <br/>
neat tiny food containers (2"x2"x1") for micro-letterboxes!  6 for <br/>
$1!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some of you folks.  See you on the trail!!!<br/>
<br/>
God Bless,<br/>
