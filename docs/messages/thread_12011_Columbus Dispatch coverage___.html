person who hid it, and was told she would check it out in a <br/>
"week." That was about a week ago. Try finding Leatherlips, <br/>
Whet-stone, and Grigg's Reservoir. They were good for us <br/>
beginners. We found Park of Roses by fudging. Apparently the <br/>
benches were moved and the clues don't quite work.<br/>
<br/>
It's nice to know about another newbie in the area! I'll be hiding a <br/>
couple as soon as I carve a stamp I like. Sounds like a good <br/>
school project! <br/>

Field of corn and Leather lips are back up and in good<br/>
shape... will try to check on rest of mine in Columbus<br/>
area Quickly since the article has people out<br/>
looking...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to those who wrote to let me know there was<br/>
a problem...<br/>
<br/>
Rewriting Rose is a Rose with new directions since the<br/>
bench and a fence has been moved.<br/>
It can still be found without these clues... The basic<br/>
clues tell you pretty much where it is.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this aritcle will get more people placing<br/>
boxes in the area....<br/>
