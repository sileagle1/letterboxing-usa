<br/>
First let me give a huge thank you to Karen Thomsen for the Haley <br/>
Farm (Groton, CT) boxes! Your choices of "off the beaten path" <br/>
locations were very wise and enjoyable, indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Strangely enough, as we were approaching Haley box #2, a guy was just <br/>
putting it back. We were immediately identifiable as "boxers" with <br/>
our LbNA patch visible from the front, but the logo meant nothing to <br/>
him. He said, "Looking for this?" and held up the box. He claimed to <br/>
have just stumbled upon it because the pile of rocks it was under <br/>
looked strange. He had no stamp and claimed to know nothing of <br/>
letterboxing or the websites. We gave him much enthusiastic <br/>
information and maybe we'll be seeing him on the talk list someday. <br/>
But I gotta tell ya...it seemed highly unlikely that someone would <br/>
just "stumble across" that box in THAT out of the way location....<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of patches: instead of sewing mine to the BACK of my pack <br/>
(where you obviously can't see it until I'm gone), I sewed it on <br/>
padded shoulder strap right where it can be easily seen as I'm <br/>
approaching someone on the trail. Looks good!<br/>

<br/>
That's a great idea, sewing the patch on the backpack strap instead of on<br/>
the back of the pack!  I sure never would have thought of that!<br/>
