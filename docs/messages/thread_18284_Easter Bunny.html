                    <div class="plaintext-content">last year the Easter Bunny (E.B.) hid the Easter eggs and goodies on <br/>
saturday. the kids 15, 16, and 16 were not allowed to find them until <br/>
after dark. With flashlights and baskets in hand they set off to find <br/>
them. E.B. had left me a list of where they were hidden, the older i <br/>
get the more i need this list. there were alot of "am i cold or hot" <br/>
being yelled all over the yard. it was the funniest thing you ever <br/>
saw or didn't see. <br/>
this year i heard that at some homes he is going to hide them <br/>
letterboxing style. so after church with baskets and clues in hand we <br/>
will be "Eggboxing"?!?!?!?!?!<br/>
Happy Easter to all and safe boxing,<br/>
