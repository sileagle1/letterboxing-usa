I think if the money is coming out of your pocket, you should be <br/>
getting ALL the credit for the contribution!<br/>
<br/>
If you created a box saying people could leave a buck or two (but <br/>
optional, of course) which you'd collect every now and then to donate <br/>
to charity, making it out to LbNA would be appropriate.  Granted, it <br/>
would be an honor system and you'd have to hope some jerk doesn't <br/>
come by to steal the money between donations and hope the box doesn't <br/>
goes missing, but I doubt most letterboxers would commit such a crime <br/>
against charities and it would probably be very successful.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone ever tries this 'honor system', I'd love to hear about its <br/>
success (or lack thereof).  <br/>

<p>Hi Brian!  We are excited to learn about your charity HH!  We were playing around with various ideas about how to do a charity box.  We had two main concerns -- One was making people feel obligated to contribute (although you kind of hope the good thoughts would rub off -- and they did -- because now your planning yours!) and two that if people did put in money, it might get swiped.  </p></div>
<p>We also thought it would be great to join our contributions together in the name of LBNA to make a positive statement (especially to the various park services etc.)....Maybe you or another boxer will better be able to figure out the logistics.</p></div>
<p>For now, we are starting small.  We will content ourselves with our personal donations, hoping that the charity will get positive publicity and awareness (and who knows, maybe another donation or two) from this stamp.  There are so many incredible charities and programs out there that we never find out about.</p>
<div></div>
<p>I think a HH would be inspirational.  Think of all the people it would touch.  Someone had once suggested doing a special stamp for every charity.  Maybe if we do this, we will send the stamp (and information) on its way as a HH to spread the word and inspire more people.</p>
<div></div>
<p>Good luck with your stamp!  Let us know how it works out!  BeMa </p>

Hi!<br/>
<br/>
When I was in Great Britain this summer, the way the charity boxes there<br/>
seem to work is that people make a contribution in order to get a copy of<br/>
the clues to the box.  Which would give the finder a chance to contribute,<br/>
as well as the planter.  I'd certainly be willing to participate in that<br/>
way.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, its been reported that on the moors across the pond, when<br/>
they do charity walks (which involve temporary boxes), some sponges<br/>
have stolen them.  While I agree with the assertion that "most <br/>
letterboxers [...]",  I'd claim a couple would, which of course would <br/>
ruin it.  There are jerks in geocaching, and there are jerks in <br/>
letterboxing -- I personally don't believe any large population is <br/>
jerk free ...<br/>
<br/>
A better approach may be to set up a paypal account with the contact<br/>
info in the box, or to put in envelopes that could be sent directly<br/>
to the charity.  You could also probably do something interesting with<br/>
stickers, I guess, tho that would look tacky.  As for "LbNA", there is <br/>
really no such thing (or someone correct me if I'm wrong) to "make <br/>
it out to".<br/>
