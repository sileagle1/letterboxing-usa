                    <div class="plaintext-content">To any that attempt to find Hidden Pond a little advice.  Give yourselves<br/>
plenty of time.    Onetime ,by chance while spreading the news about<br/>
letterboxing , in a bookstore in Saugerties, this person knew about the<br/>
place because they were local to the area  and knew it by a different<br/>
name which escapes me at the moment.  The Sander's Kill stream flows into<br/>
uncharted (public) territory and has many strange features like irregular<br/>
shaped clear bottom pools - no fish.  <br/>
The hike starts off by heading northeast following a road which comes to<br/>
a field.  We last tried the hike differently, we crossed the stream at<br/>
this point and followed the stream hugging the left side. This brought us<br/>
way up high and then back down until we saw the hunter's cabin on the<br/>
otherside. We stayed on this side of the stream for about a mile!. When<br/>
you get to the falls and over the top you get to a few splitts. Stay to<br/>
the RIGHT. In a small opening there are two spruce trees , between these<br/>
tree is the path that leads to the pond! You will need lots more help<br/>
after this but  you are now about 1/4 of a mile from the pond.<br/>
................... Better wait until a nice warm Spring day!          <br/>
