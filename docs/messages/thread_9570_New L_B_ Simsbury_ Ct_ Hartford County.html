Planted by Rubaduc 12-6-02<br/>
3 miles round trip<br/>
Going west on Rt.185 from the intersection of Rt. 218, Talcott Mt. State<br/>
Park is 3.3. miles on your left. The entrance is in Simsbury, though some<br/>
of the park is in Bloomfield.<br/>
<br/>
This box is planted for my favorite sister who not only thinks outside<br/>
the box but lives outside the box.<br/>
<br/>
In the winter the yellow gate just in from the road is closed, so the<br/>
walk is a tad longer. Park along the road near the gate and walk up the<br/>
road until you see the sign to Heublein Tower. The tower is open in the<br/>
summer and the view from the top is a must see, on a clear day visibility<br/>
is 50 miles. <br/>
The trail to the top is yellow blazed, although not always clearly<br/>
marked, just follow the main trail to the top. This is pretty steep but<br/>
there are several log benches to rest on along the way.  At the end of<br/>
the climb is a magnificent view of the Farmington River Valley, this is<br/>
also the jumping off spot for hang gliders. After getting your fill of<br/>
the view, the trail turns left and follows the ridge line before heading<br/>
into the woods.<br/>
Just before the tower the yellow trail splits, stay straight heading<br/>
towards the log bench  and a slight incline, before long you'll see a red<br/>
sign on a tree saying H.T. straight ahead. The blue trail enters on your<br/>
left at this point and the trail will be blue blazed up to the tower.<br/>
After seeing the view and visiting the tower, turn around and come back<br/>
to the blue/yellow split and take the blue to your right. Counting<br/>
blazes, stop at the third blue blaze and look to the east for a tallish<br/>
tree stump, at the base under rocks is what you seek.<br/>
Be very careful as you retrieve this treasure as this is a busy park and<br/>
don't forget  to beat around the stump to dislodge any critters who might<br/>
be nesting there.<br/>
Have fun.<br/>
