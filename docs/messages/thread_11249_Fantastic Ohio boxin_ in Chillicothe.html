                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, after such a long Winter, Franzsolo &amp; I decided to take advantage of<br/>
this beautiful weather (before it changed it's mind!) &amp; spent the day<br/>
boxin'. We left Cinci at 9am and drove toward Chillicothe. We started<br/>
searching for boxes at 10am and after lots of hiking and clue deciphering,<br/>
we went home successful and happy at 7pm with 22 boxes and 3 HH!!!<br/>
AND I reached the 100 found mark (&amp; flew by it!)<br/>
Here's what we found:<br/>
<br/>
We started at a rest stop drive up to find FLYFISHER (the box, not the boxer<br/>
:-)<br/>
Then we went on to Scioto Park &amp; found BITTY BIRD and STONEY CREEK<br/>
While at Stoney creek, we found LEGENDS LIVE FOREVER HH (My 100 find!!)<br/>
and I stamped the LONGHORN HH that was left in one of the boxes today. Hint.<br/>
LLF was taken by Franz to be placed later.<br/>
Before leaving the park, Franz placed SCIOTO TRAILS S.P. box (clues posted<br/>
soon)<br/>
<br/>
Then we went to very cute and VERY CROWDED Great Seal State Park to find the<br/>
GREAT SEAL box, MOUND EYES - I had to stamp this one twice to get eyes :-)<br/>
MONKEY SHINES, and PINING AWAY. We were first to stamp into pining. All I<br/>
have to say is be mindful of how you get to this one, so you can get back<br/>
out! I also suggest you get it soon before the briars really grow up!<br/>
<br/>
We touched on the bike corridor for the first time today to get BOX TURTLE<br/>
where we found the FLYING SNAKE HH!! Franz took this one too - to be placed<br/>
soon. We had some trouble finding the right rocks for YOU TAKE THE HIGH<br/>
ROAD, I'LL TAKE THE LOW ROAD mystery box, but did find it. We had to sit on<br/>
the edge of the rocks and watch the birds on the water for awhile with the<br/>
dogs so we didn't draw suspicion for this one.<br/>
<br/>
We then started on the boxes in Yoctangee Park. DEER BADEN, YOCTANGEE BADEN<br/>
&amp; EERIE EERIE EERIE all in good shape. Franz planted a new box near here<br/>
too! He just can't seem to Find without Placing :-) HIN MALLETS caused us<br/>
the greatest hike. We kept thinking it was 'the close shelter', but it<br/>
wasn't...so we'd try the next shelter, wasn't that one either. Finally,<br/>
after we walked across the entire park (we started by the stairs to Water<br/>
St!), we finally found the right shelter. Quite a hike to the box and back.<br/>
On the way back, we found BEARFOOT IN THE PARK. The park was so busy, we had<br/>
to be very creative so as not to draw attention to the hiding place. It<br/>
helps to have two people and two dogs!<br/>
<br/>
Then we went back to the bike trail to find THREE LITTLE FISHIES - cool<br/>
hiding spot!<br/>
