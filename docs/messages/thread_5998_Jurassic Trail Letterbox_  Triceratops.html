<br/>
On Friday, June 28, 2002, we attempted to find the "Triceratops" Letterbox,<br/>
part of the Jurassic Trail series in Ramapo State Forest, Oakland, N.J.<br/>
Although we had a wonderful hike that day, we were disappointed to make the<br/>
long climb with our 6 year old, and not be able to find the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Wingfoot, can you or anyone else out there who has found it, tell us what we<br/>
did wrong?  We have found about 8 letterboxes in MA, some of them tricky,<br/>
and this box was the first one we had to give up on.  Since we are from out<br/>
of state, we may not get back there for another year or so.<br/>
<br/>
We hiked to the two trees, one with a nailed on round red blaze, went back<br/>
down the trail 12 paces (We counted each step as one), then followed<br/>
approximately 50 paces at 225 degrees.  We seemed to be in the place<br/>
described, as we found the rock formation and could see Pompton Lake.  Then<br/>
the final set of directions was more difficult, due to the terrain and the<br/>
brush.  We headed to 140 degrees, and found the 4 foot drop off, but....we<br/>
were stumped to find the exact location of the letterbox.  Many small trees,<br/>
many rocks....<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell us what we did wrong?<br/>

I'm sorry if you were unable to find this box.  I'm positive it's <br/>
still there.  Hopefully you were able to locate the other posted <br/>
Jurassic box, it's a bit easier.  There are a bunch more that haven't <br/>
been posted (and some to be hidden) yet.  I placed this box after one <br/>
of my boxes had gone missing, and have now decided to hide my boxes <br/>
in locations that I don't think non-letterboxing folks will stumble <br/>
across.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully you enjoyed the hike anyway, it does have some great <br/>
views.  I'm pleased to hear that a six year old could handle it, I <br/>
thought it was much tougher then that.<br/>
