Yes, I use PZ Kut. I have tried other mediums, but found the most success<br/>
for fine detail with the PZ Kut. It seems to hold up well to the weather and<br/>
abuse of multiple stamping too. I tend to prefer a carving challenge, so I<br/>
do small, intricate stamps. The other mediums just don't hold up in my<br/>
opinion. Even though it's thinner then some of the other stuff, I don't put<br/>
a back on my stamps either. I had been doing that, but they always seemed to<br/>
curl concave rather than convex (I guess it would help if I used a harder<br/>
wood, but oh well). I have found I get the best images by not backing it,<br/>
but using something solid and flat (like the top to my ink stamp) to press<br/>
it on my paper. Because of the lack of large 'open' spaces on most of my<br/>
stamps, just pressing them with your fingers works fine too.<br/>
A magnifying glass is the only way to go when you want fine detail! Proper<br/>
transfer of the image, using an iron or acetone is critical too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

Once again, for anyone who hasn't already seen my stamp images (placed in<br/>
Ohio, Indiana &amp; Michigan), you can see them at my website:<br/>

Hiya!<br/>
<br/>
Did you tell me you use PZ Kut as your stamping medium?  My friend Heather<br/>
is<br/>
agog over the stamps you entered in my journal and I'm not sure I remember<br/>
what you use.  (I do remember the magnifying glass!)<br/>
