</i><b>You know..... if I was going to design a backpack for letterboxing... it would include a goodly sized pocket with a wipable lined interior for inky stamps... another with slots for my ink pads... a large rigid surface to stamp up on... a lanyard for my compass, waterproof compartment for my journal...  now, I don't know where you would find this... but you could try REI.com for some decent day packs &amp; other hiking equipment.<br/>

<div>I've been using  a clear 
plastic container at home to store my carving tools, Speedball medium, and then 
a couple of cigar boxes for my finished, mounted stamps. I also use a 
medium sized plastic tool box for all my kite making supplies. It would be 
almost better then the flat container I am using now. The tool box has a 
removable tool tray inside and plenty of room under the tray.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I use a North Face fanny pack 
which fits my 5.5"x8.5" Strathmore Sketch pad(Logbook), my stamp, two ink pads 
and a small pocket size container of baby wipes (cleaning the stamps), and it 
has a separate thin zipper compartment on top, which I keep the compass 
in.  And last but not lease if I have a couple of boxes to plant and carry, 
I have a regular sized day pack which will fit a days worth of food and water 
and the fanny pack full of LB supplies.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>ps...I get my letterboxes from 
my local Wal-Mart. $3 for 2.50 they are rectangular and you can see them at my 
web site.  <a href="http://www.1bigred.com/jayc/letterbox/">www.1bigred.com/jayc/letterbox/</a></div>

reply:  I love my L.L.Bean back pack. It fits several ready to plant <br/>
boxes my EMS first aid kit. All my and my son &amp;dogs letterboxing <br/>
supplies and in this season a whole set of dry clothes, ( ever hike <br/>
with a little boy - they always get wet). It has several sections and <br/>
reflective stripe for safety. <br/>
   At home I keep stamps and carving supplies and  other supplies in <br/>
a converted CD tower the little wooden cabinet is painted like the <br/>
forest appropriately.  Since the winter event I've had a box full of <br/>
extras that won't fit ,need to get that down to size. Hope you find <br/>
just the right thing to contain your hobby but keep in mind it grows!<br/>
