 That's right Devilish Dragonflies, you're living high on the hog <br/>

  The Vanderbilt LB will always be special for me because of the fox <br/>
I saw on the trail.  She stopped and looked at me and then went on <br/>
her way...She went to her brood as I heard them on the other side of <br/>
the ledge. She was big for a fox and seemed to me she has seen many <br/>
years!<br/>
<br/>
  I am working on a couple of plants for the Hudson Valley in NY. Is <br/>
there anyone willing to guide a newbie?<br/>

I am interested in our mention of the Devilsih Dragon Flies.  This is the name of a Hitch Hiker LB that we found back in Sept 2002 and relocated to a new (unnamed site).<br/>
<br/>
Did you find this HH and relocated it?<br/>
If it is, let the talk group know when and where you found it, but not where you relocated it to.<br/>
