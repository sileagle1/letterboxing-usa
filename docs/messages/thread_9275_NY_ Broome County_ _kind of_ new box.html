Silent Doug, Strawberry Girl and I set out determined to find it one bright <br/>
warm day this past July. After hours spent poking around logs without <br/>
success, we finally accepted that the elusive box was in fact missing.<br/>
<br/>
While Silent Doug set off on one last attempt to search based on a <br/>
different interpretation of the clues, Strawberry Girl and I decided to be <br/>
subversive on the trail instead. Since I'd known there was a good <br/>
possibility we wouldn't find the box, I'd prepared another box at home to <br/>
hide in what we thought was the Bus Driver's place. Not intended as a <br/>
replacement, Imposter #1 has steathily slipped into its stolen home until <br/>
the Bus Driver returns to claim its rightful place.<br/>
<br/>
Not expecting Imposter #1 to receive many visitors, I didn't post about its <br/>
misappropriated lodging place. This week I've heard that quite a few people <br/>
have unearthed this Imposter since July, so maybe the time has come for the <br/>
box to turn legit. If you'd like to unmask Imposter #1 for yourself, you <br/>
can find the necessary details here:<br/>

Thanks to those who updated us on Imposter #1's status!<br/>
