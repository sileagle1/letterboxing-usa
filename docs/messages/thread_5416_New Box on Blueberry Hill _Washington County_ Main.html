                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, the title is a bit of a misnomer.  We had intended on <br/>
placing it somewhere on the blueberry barrens near our house, but due <br/>
to spraying, it's off limits.  It's a beautiful walk and fairly easy, <br/>
but better safe than sorry.  So here's the new spot....<br/>
 About 40 miles from the town of Ellsworth Maine, East on RT 1, <br/>
you'll come upon an oasis of civilization. This is the town of <br/>
Columbia, population 450, and several moose.  There is a cluster of <br/>
stores, known as The Four Corners Shopping Plaza.  You'll see an Ace <br/>
Hardware, a Citgo station, a Machias Savings Bank, and various other <br/>
little businesses.  Directly after the Ace Hardware, turn left and <br/>
drive north.  About 3 miles up, you'll come to another 4 way <br/>
intersection that looks more like a driveway than a road...drive on <br/>
through.  At the 4 mile mark, you'll come to the top of a hill.  <br/>
Continue driving down the hill and bear right and you'll come to a <br/>
small bridge.  Park on the far side of the bridge,on the right, <br/>
underneath the street sign that bears the names Saco Rd and <br/>
Farnsworth Rd.  You'll find a little path right off the <br/>
pavement,heading down toward the river.  At the trails end (about 50 <br/>
paces), look to the left to see a boulder and two trees.  Our <br/>
Blueberry Hill letterbox is snug under some rocks at the base.<br/>
<br/>
It's a fairly easy walk, tho not handicapped accessible.  And you'll <br/>
get to see some mighty spectacular country that you'd probably <br/>
otherwise miss.  <br/>
<br/>
This is the first box we've planted.  We hope you enjoy the hunt.<br/>
