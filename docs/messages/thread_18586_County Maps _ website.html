I just want to say that it is truly one of the most artistic and fun and informative websites I've come across in a long time.  Had I come through art school about 2 years later, I might be doing such things.  But then, I'm a firm believer in old dogs learning new tricks!  Thanks, to you and anyone else involved in creating it, for the originality and flair.  I was hooked the minute I saw the first page. What kinds of websites do you appreciate links from, if any?  Our folk music group has a site on which we could put a link...not that letterboxing is exactly related !  It's at www.daybreakfolk.com . Maybe the famed Music Woman would enjoy it, except that there's no letterbox at the end of it, YET! (I'm blown away by those counts! )  Well,  I hope everyone remembers to send you their counties.  ---lunaryakketyact<br/>
