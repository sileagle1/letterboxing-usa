We used a store bought sig stamp for our first 500 finds.<br/>
Also anyone that exchanged with us in our first 10 months of 'boxing <br/>
has that store bought image (Yes it took us 10 months to find 500 <br/>
boxes, whatever that means - to some it's a lot, to others it is not <br/>
but that's our personal experiences and wouldn't expect anyone else <br/>
to care one way or the other).  We finally decided that we needed to <br/>
personalize our stamp after looking at our exchanges one day and <br/>
realized that there were at least 3 other "sig stamps" that were <br/>
identical to ours.   <br/>
<br/>
Moral of the story (if there is one) your sig stamp is your personal <br/>
mark in the letterboxing world. You need to decide when and if you <br/>
want your own unique image that cannot be imitated by anyone. If you <br/>
don't care, why should anyone else?  (Here's to you, TeamRedDragon, <br/>
where ever you may be tonite)<br/>
