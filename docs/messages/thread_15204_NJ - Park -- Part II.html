                    <div class="plaintext-content">What were we doing here being eaten up alive by mosquitoes and gnats instead <br/>
of dining, alone, together (that sounds funny, doesn't it?...) at a <br/>
restaurant without any little containers of ketchup by our sides?!<br/>
<br/>
I'll admit it.  It was my fault.  I just couldn't let it go.  I knew we <br/>
could find those boxes.  So close, yet so far.  It was driving me nuts.  <br/>
Especially as these were mystery boxes that we had figured out almost a year <br/>
ago.  So, Da, a wise wise man who knows that Na needs to be appeased AND fed <br/>
at regular intervals had agreed to go back to [sic] to find the boxes before <br/>
heading out for our romantic dinner.<br/>
<br/>
We figured this would be an easy one.  It seemed custom tailored for kids <br/>
with all the [sic] and [sic] and finding all the clues and all.  After all, <br/>
what self respecting adult would ride around on the [sic], not to mention <br/>
the [sic] without at least one child along?!<br/>
<br/>
We didn't even dress for a hike.  I had my strappy sandals and no hat or eau <br/>
de Off.  Run in, scoop it up, stamp it in and "hello linen napkins and no <br/>
cutting anyone else's food" (unless Da really needed me to..)<br/>
<br/>
We left the kids happy as clams in Grandma's craft room.  Grandma, like me <br/>
never throws out anything with artistic possibilities.  Thus, she has a <br/>
basement full of crap (I mean inspirational snippets).  Unlike me, she is <br/>
smart enough to let the kiddies have at it (thereby giving them loads of fun <br/>
while transferring ownership and location of all this stuff to my house -- <br/>
and, of course, being the kids art work, forget about the basement -- it <br/>
gets routed to one of the main floors -- normally on top of a stack on a <br/>
flat surface somewhere where no one has the immediate need to sit)  Grandma <br/>
and Grandpa had recovered sufficiently from their stress at the pool (or <br/>
maybe they hadn't -- they were all in the basement after all, weren't <br/>
they?!)<br/>
<br/>
Da and I got an early start, around 4 and headed for the park.  This would <br/>
give us plenty of time for the quick boxing detour and a wonderful, <br/>
relaxing, intimate dinner at a wonderful, relaxing and intimate pan asian <br/>
restaurant.  Da could have the sushi he loved and I could order one of <br/>
everything else and let him taste (after all -- sharing is the way with <br/>
asian food!)<br/>
<br/>
We found the correct Cafe.  It was closed, but, no worries as we expected to <br/>
eat fine real soon.  Before hitting the trail, I checked in with my mom to <br/>
see how my dad was doing.  He was in the hospital for some exploratory <br/>
surgery.  Mom said it was progressing well.  Oddly enough, she commented <br/>
that the lights at the hospital had all gone off but then come back on.  <br/>
Strange, but, didn't think much of it.<br/>
<br/>
With our really cool Mad Libs type clues, we went in search of box #1.  This <br/>
time the compass readings made sense and we found the trail into the woods.  <br/>
Rocks in trail were all where they were supposed to be.  And, without Miss <br/>
Ma (who I really did miss [Be too] but I knew was having a great time with a <br/>
Grandma and Grandpa who loved her [and him] almost as much as Da and I did <br/>
so it was ok that Da and I got out to enjoy ourselves -- alone -- every once <br/>
in a while without being plagued with guilt.  Right?...)  As I was saying, <br/>
without Ma to trip over all these clue rocks, Da and I were maintaining a <br/>
good pace.  I have to admit, though, that the trail was going on a little <br/>
longer than we had presupposed.  Strappy sandals were slipping to the right <br/>
and the left and the smell of eau de Off would have been real sweet right <br/>
now....  We found the Choo Choo Letterbox and stamped in.  Great stamp!<br/>
<br/>
On to box #2.  We walked for a while seeking a "culvert".  What is a culvert <br/>
anyway?  Da looked to me, who is the family vocabulary expert.  I did <br/>
graduate with higher honors than he did, but, I mean, really, who thinks <br/>
about that once you've graduated?!  (ok -- I mean, who brings it up all the <br/>
time unnecessarily after one graduates?!  Ok -- I mean -- what was that <br/>
number for Mensa?  [only kidding -- I'm not going to bring that whole <br/>
subject up again!])  We kept walking.  The bugs were swarming, the strappy <br/>
sandals were stretching and the hats were dug out of the backpack and <br/>
positioned over the "Yeah -- we're finally going out somewhere" hair do.  I <br/>
started thinking about all the mosquitoes and the tics.  Lime disease.  West <br/>
Nile.  My Mom actually contracted West Nile three years ago (disorientation, <br/>
loss of motor skills, apparent stroke, coma, the whole shebang).  She <br/>
recovered fully -- amazingly because she was lucky enough to be treated by a <br/>
doctor who recognized the symptoms (very uncommon back then).  I didn't want <br/>
to go through that again.<br/>
<br/>
We finally found the fence posts and started counting.  Funny thing, though, <br/>
those posts were awfully high up and hard to count.  I'm surprised we even <br/>
noticed them.  Another alarm bell started going off.  Normally, when the <br/>
clues seem too convoluted -- you're doing something wrong (this was even the <br/>
case with Froggy -- although not with Glencarlyn which I still believe is <br/>
riding around in someone's back pack).  We walked on.  Sweat and itchy welts <br/>
do not a romantic picture make, but, I was determined and Da was going to <br/>
make me cry Uncle first since he had agreed to search for these boxes again <br/>
just for me.  We did finally find the box and this second stamp was also <br/>
great.  But, our undying thanks goes out to whomever left that little note <br/>
of encouragement in the baggy in the wrong hollow tree!  One other small <br/>
note -- fence posts and fence poles are synonymous for this box.  The poles <br/>
are easy to find and count -- just keep going.<br/>
<br/>
I knew I should have paid attention to all those "Help -- I don't know my <br/>
trees" postings earlier.  I did save them and bookmark the sites.  But, lot <br/>
o good that did us now.  We couldn't identify the black cherry tree.  And, <br/>
if we could have and it had had cherries still hanging off of it, we would <br/>
have been happy cause I was sweaty, itchy, hungry and just a weeee bit <br/>
grumpy by now (not to mention no longer looking as fine as I had when we <br/>
left the in-laws)  We counted more fence posts and looked behind lots of <br/>
double Sycamores -- at least I think they were Sycamores...  I should say <br/>
that Da looked behind every tree because by now the sandals just weren't <br/>
going anywhere but out.<br/>
<br/>
We finally gave up on box number three and retraced our steps to the car.  <br/>
As we drove to the restaurant through all the tiny NJ towns we remarked on <br/>
how many of these little intersections seemed to have lights that were out.  <br/>
Odd.  Now, driving anywhere in Bergen county is an experience.  There are no <br/>
main roads, only lots of curvy little roads through curvy little towns.  <br/>
You've heard of ten European cities in eight days (I did that by train when <br/>
I was a teen).  This is eleven little Jersey towns in ten minutes.  If you <br/>
don't know where you are going -- you are toast.  Fortunately, Da has a <br/>
wonderful sense of direction (you would have needed it to survive growing up <br/>
there).  Unfortunately, we were using Grandma directions "go a little <br/>
further than the A&amp;P and then take one of the next streets on the right, or <br/>
is it the left, I can't quite remember the name but you will remember it <br/>
when you see it -- you used to play Little League at a field there...."  We <br/>
must have suddenly come into cell phone range because Da's phone started <br/>
ringing and he noticed there were quite a few missed calls.  Turns out it <br/>
was Grandma and Grandpa explaining that all the power was out and the kids <br/>
were "freaking out"  they were really sorry to ask, but, could we PLEASE <br/>
come home.  We realized that was why so many of the street lights were out, <br/>
but, in so many towns?  We turned off the Pokemon CD and turned on the radio <br/>
to learn of the blackout.  Luckily they had already determined that it was <br/>
not terrorism and so we rested a bit easier.  I am so glad that we did not <br/>
have to go through that anxiety again (although I felt for everyone else in <br/>
those moments of uncertainty!) As we drove, we passed Westwood, the town <br/>
where the really good pan Asian restaurant was and noticed that amazingly, <br/>
all those lights were on.  We called the grandparents and told them to call <br/>
the restaurant to make a reservation for us all.  We swung by the darkened <br/>
house and picked up the rest of the family, heading out to eat at a really <br/>
good pan Asian restaurant.  The meal wouldn't be romantic or relaxing, but, <br/>
we would all be together, three generations breaking bread together.  Are <br/>
you kidding?  They had air conditioning -- we were going!!  The meal was <br/>
great and a lot of fun.  They even had special kiddie chop sticks.  Ma only <br/>
got out of her seat (bumping the senior lady at the table next to us) about <br/>
twelve times (I hope she wasn't one of the ones from the pool...)  Be and Da <br/>
were surrounded by sushi (one of the only things Be likes to eat, along with <br/>
Duck, king crab, lobster and really good lox...)  Miss Ma and I prefer our <br/>
food cooked (and preferably covered in chocolate).<br/>
<br/>
We sat at the table as long as we possibly could, eating, chatting with our <br/>
loved ones and soaking up the air conditioning.  Although the staff never <br/>
said an unkind word (they were great!) we realized it was time to go.  The <br/>
lights at home were still off and we tried to figure out the best sleeping <br/>
arrangements.  All I could think of was "if the thermostat was set at 77 <br/>
before the power went off..."  I phoned my Mom to ensure that all was well <br/>
with my Dad.  The hospital had a generator (of course) and that is why the <br/>
power had flicked back on.  Dad was resting at it was actually a good time <br/>
to be in a hospital.  Mom didn't have AC but they did have a mega generator <br/>
at home which powered the lights and appliances.  Da and I thought -- no <br/>
power no AC versus no AC but lights and a full, cool fridge....  Hmmm.  We <br/>
were packing the card to head to my folks (about an hour away) when the <br/>
lights flickered back on in Bergen County.  I won't tell you how that <br/>
happened dramatically as I entered the house to get some more luggage and I <br/>
take no personal responsibility for my own magnetism actually causing this <br/>
to happen, but, I believe the facts speak for themselves!<br/>
<br/>
We all breathed a sigh of relief.  After all, now thousands of people could <br/>
see and function, cool off and hopefully return to their houses.  AND we had <br/>
only missed fifteen minutes of the Amazing Race -- wahoooo!  We ran to the <br/>
TV only to discover that every show (with the exception of CatDog) had been <br/>
preempted by the news.  The story and film truly were amazing to see.  All <br/>
those people in the streets, the dark Manhattan skyline.  It really caused <br/>
us to reflect back.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised to the extent that they focused on Detroit, meaning no <br/>
disrespect.  Da commented again that Michigan was a great state (having gone <br/>
to B school there) and that Detroit had some wonderful areas around it.  "I <br/>
know" I fired back "I saw Risky Business!"  I told you I am smarter than he <br/>
is....  He did choose me to marry though -- how smart is that?!!!  (that's a <br/>
rhetorical question and the correct answer is "as smart as one can possibly <br/>
be with or without Mensa membership)<br/>
<br/>
We used the blackout as an excuse to crank up the in-laws AC and all went to <br/>
sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the Cahillys for this fun set of boxes!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  No one in Ohio hid a box near a certain set of power lines, did <br/>
you?!...<br/>
