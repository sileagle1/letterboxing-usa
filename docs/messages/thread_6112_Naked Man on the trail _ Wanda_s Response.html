                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bonnie - thank you so much for taking the time to<br/>
share your experience.  I think many of us on this<br/>
list find ourselves out hiking alone - at least some<br/>
of the time.  It is important for us all to remember<br/>
to be aware of our surroundings, take proper<br/>
precautions (whistle, cell phones, tell someone where<br/>
you are going and when you get back, etc), and stay<br/>
safe.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Wanda, I know of your "extensive" hiking<br/>
experience, and standing your ground can be a good<br/>
option.  However, stay alert as it can also get you in<br/>
just as much trouble as running.  You never know.<br/>
<br/>
As for airing your personal grievances and problems<br/>
with family members - here is totally not appropriate.<br/>
 I don't care if you do or don't get along with your<br/>
mother or other family members.  Probably most on this<br/>
list don't.  If you have an issue with her, take a bit<br/>
of your own advice and stand up to her.  Deal with it<br/>
like a big girl and don't whine and point fingers<br/>
here.  It is not the place, and not the time.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great form with LOTS of great people.  I am<br/>
so happy that my best friend turned me on to this<br/>
sport and this list.  I love hearing about new boxes,<br/>
how new people got involved, things people like best<br/>
about the sport, why they do it.  I like the "arm<br/>
chair" conversations about our boxing experiences,<br/>
lessons learned, and, on occasion, mishaps (I am still<br/>
working on keeping my right and left straight ;o) ). <br/>
I love the conversations that go on about how to keep<br/>
Letterboxing going, and growing, and work in<br/>
partnership with local park and land authorities.  <br/>
<br/>
Just MTCW - your mileage may vary.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing to all - the weather in wonderful!!<br/>

                    <html><body>I must say in Wanda's defense that I, for one, took Wanda's jabs at her mother to be probably just what she intended them to be: quite humorous.  Let's please try to keep things light in our postings.  It is a defect of E-mail that due to the impossibility of expressing emotion when posting correspondence, it is equally impossible to discern the writer's emotional intent behind any given comment.  Hence, I always cringe when I read someone admonishing another in a group.  My limited experience with people in this group has proven them to be a fun and gregarious group, and I doubt that anyone would intentionally post with malicious intent.  Let's all just get along -- or I'm taking away your lunch recess for a week!<br/>
