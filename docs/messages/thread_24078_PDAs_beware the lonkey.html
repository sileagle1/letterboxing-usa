When you plant a box, let me know if it is a lonkey box so I can drive<br/>
over and find it. For that I will make the trip!<br/>

I have never heard the Lonkey myself but I scrapbooked a whole page on<br/>
the legend of the lonkey using a poster Lunascarab made. And<br/>
apparently now there is a whole legend behind it.<br/>

I think it is the State Animal of North Carolina.<br/>

I think it would be sooooooo hysterical if Luna planted a box on the<br/>
