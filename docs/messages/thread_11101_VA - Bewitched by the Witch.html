<div>Oh to be outside!  To feel the sun on our faces!  To not be knee deep in the snow (but ankle deep in the mud...)!  Team BeMa headed outdoors again after weeks inside.  Our quarry - the Tysons Witch letterbox -- close to home and conveniently located near a Taco Bell!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The story was really interesting (and induced no nightmares that night!).  Ma kept looking around at the ground for evidence of the fire (she's a little literal with a somewhat warped sense of time...)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Everything was just were it was supposed to be (no card catalog flexing required... lol)  That is the biggest letterbox we have yet encountered!  Good thing 'cause the little ones had to lean way over to reach for it and if it were any smaller, they would have fallen right into the tire (not that they would have minded -- but it was pretty wet and muddy).  We were hoping for  a gazillion hitchhikers since we have only found one and they would have all fit nicely.  But -- no such luck!  (need to move out west for that)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We headed home happy and with stronger leg muscles after having conquered that hill.  So much for my predictions to Da "It's just a couple of directions from the bottom of this hill -- how long can a hill be?"...  I guess this is revenge for the hill at "Curtain Up"... (but I wouldn't try and roll down it!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for the fun box!  BeMa</div>
