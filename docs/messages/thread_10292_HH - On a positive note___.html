That's what I use this forum for...to see what you guys are thinking. <br/>
To hear about letterboxing issues in other parts of the country. <br/>
<br/>
And I don't mind arguing a little if my opinion differs from <br/>
yours...but I don't really think that I am going to change you or <br/>
your stance on a subject. No one should feel that their point of view <br/>
is threatened.<br/>
<br/>
I am just glad that you guys are all out there planting and finding <br/>
letterboxes in whatever way, shape, or form!! :-)<br/>

BTW Trish, it still brutally cold.  We ought to send some of this stuff out<br/>
west.  This morning we had temps colder than Nome, AK.<br/>
