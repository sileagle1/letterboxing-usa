Island, British Columbia last year I bought him a bear bell to attach to<br/>
his pack.  Since he was doing the trail solo it was better than nothing.<br/>
Some hiking books and stores and a ranger think it's a good idea.  It's<br/>
louder than a little jingle bell but not quite as huge as a cow bell.  <br/>
<br/>
Bears in the wilderness tend to go in a different direction when they<br/>
hear people coming.  Lots of berry bushes along that path up there, so<br/>
if you warn the bears before you get between them and their food source<br/>
at least you have some chance of preventing an encounter.  In fact, he<br/>
didn't see any bears on that hike (a rarety, they say) but he said there<br/>
was fresh evidence of one just ahead of him at one point (feathers<br/>
everywhere from a torn apart bird) and I think prints or scat.  <br/>
<br/>
There's my two cents on that topic. <br/>
