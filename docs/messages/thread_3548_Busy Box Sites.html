So sorry you had a hard time re-planting the "Barrel of Monkeys". <br/>
When we planted the boxes the week before, we had no problem with the <br/>
trail being busy.  I think that this past weekend, with the weather <br/>
so nice and it being peak folliage, brought out every hiker in the <br/>
state!  I don't think this box will always be that difficult to get <br/>
to.  We're glad you enjoyed the stamps, they were fun to create.  <br/>

I'm not complaining at all. It most definitely adds to the "sleuth factor"<br/>
that must be employed when looking for and ultimately replacing the box. I<br/>
liked Dan and Melissa's ball and dog routine. It's easy to rehide when<br/>
nobody is near. It takes some ingenuity to replace with a crowd around.<br/>
<br/>
Any more stories out there?<br/>

                    <html><body><p> I had a similar experience when attempting the Drews' Sound View series (somewhere in CT).  There was a group of picnickers very close to the first box of the series.  It was earlier this summer, so the area was very crowded with beach-goers.  But I was very determined that I wanted to do that series.  So, after considering what to do, I walked right up to where the box was (fortunately, I knew exactly where it was without having to search around) and plopped myself down on the ground as though I had chosen that rather unlikely spot for a rest.  Then I opened up my backpack and took everything out and spread it all around, so that when I did discreetly pull out the letterbox it would look like just another thing that had come out of my backpack.  I'm sure the picnickers didn't have any idea what I was doing -- although they did give me some funny looks, as I was rather close to their barbecue!
