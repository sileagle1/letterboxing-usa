</p><p>Not to sound like a big wimp, but with the cold temps expected tomorrow and a young letterbower in tow, can you tell me which if any of these boxes might be shorter length walks?  (I know the new H is for Heron box is one...) I couldn't really tell much from reading the clues, although I haven't checked them all.  </p>
<p>We did accomplish some chilly boxing on the Eastern Shore in November, but Little Frog has much less patience in this weather.  Oh, excuse me...make that "Big Brother Frog"....now that he has turned a mature 5 years old and is expecting a sibling, he feels he has outgrown the name "Little Frog."  DC friends, please take note. <img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/mesg/tsmileys/1.gif"/></p>
<p>Thanks for any extra info, and for planning this gathering tomorrow.  We have been eagerly awaiting the day!!!!!!!!!
