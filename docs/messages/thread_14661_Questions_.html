annoys anyone here who has read or answered the question a number of <br/>
times, but I'm just curious and I didn't want to get on anyone's bad <br/>
side - I also didn't know where to turn.<br/>
<br/>
Two things:<br/>
<br/>
*What is a sitrep?  I'm really confused on that term.<br/>
<br/>
*And also, I hear people talking about Postal Letterboxes - or LBs <br/>
that come in the mail.  Are these randomly sent? How do you attain <br/>
them or does a fellow Letterboxer send it to you b/c they know your <br/>
address?<br/>
<br/>
That's all - I hope someone can answer my questions!<br/>

people do to tell others about the condition of boxes just visited.<br/>
It's helpful to know if boxes are broken or missing parts or nice and<br/>
healthy. :-)<br/>
