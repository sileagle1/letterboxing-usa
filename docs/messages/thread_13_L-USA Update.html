A couple of updated pages for you to look at<br/>
and comment on if you like.  The second page is<br/>
awaiting some text from the Vermont Architect,<br/>
aka Viking aka Husband of the Stamp Carver:<br/>
Erik Davis<br/>
<br/>
Mitch DER Mad Stamper has been helping me with web<br/>
stuff recently and I greatly appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Lynn will be happy to know I'm not going to ask<br/>
you about colors anymore.  What we have is what<br/>
we're going with.  Its like teal &amp; sky blue<br/>
I think.  That's it until the technology<br/>
improves and allows us to customize it more.<br/>
<br/>
I had thought about something called "Kids Corner"<br/>
specifically designed for kids.  Any comments?<br/>
BTW, Bob Summers (AK) is using the Letterbox USA<br/>
page (specifically his clues sets) to teach kids<br/>
in his school about letterboxing. Cool, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Later,<br/>

I love the idea of a "Kids Corner."  If you have the time to do it, it <br/>
would be a nice addition.   Maybe kids could post their own messages? Or <br/>
drawings?<br/>

I too love the idea of a Kid's corner of some sort. What if it also had<br/>
some info geared at helping other teachers like Bob Summers, set up a<br/>
letterbox teaching unit for their kids. To me, getting classes involved<br/>
has many positive things to teach: orienteering, clue writing, local<br/>
history, art/craft, teamwork, letterBOOKS, community interface, etc.etc. <br/>
<br/>
I'll dig out the info I found about the work the schools were doing<br/>
along the VT / NH border towns (Nisa - are you listening?). As someone<br/>
said, lead the kids and the parents will follow.<br/>
<br/>
This is the idea to build upon for next spring! <br/>
Bravo!<br/>
Erik<br/>
