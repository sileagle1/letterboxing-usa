I was wondering if you could post the following message for me on <br/>
the national group? I can't post without subscribing &amp; can't take <br/>
the time to set it up now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I am so bummed. I lost my personal stamp. Yes, artTrekker the stamp <br/>
is MIA at Duncan's Landing, on the California Coast north of Bodega <br/>
Bay. Mim's excellent series Sea Creatures is SO worth visiting, and <br/>
if you go to Duncan's Landing (there is a sort of barrier trying to <br/>
keep people away from the restrooms--I went through the grass at the <br/>
right side, and this seems like a logical place for my poor little <br/>
stamp to be lost--it vaporized between the car and the box, a very <br/>
short distance), could you please do a little search for me? It is <br/>
in a little felt pocket, kind of a grass green one, with the pink <br/>
stamp hiding inside. I looked all I could, but my mom had to be back <br/>
in Healdsburg to teach a piano lesson and we were already late. <br/>
Playing hooky boxing. (Little Shop of Horrors rocks!) I had to carve <br/>
a new stamp for Healdsburg Amadeus (my mom) after she lost hers at <br/>
Sideways, and the new one is such an improvement, I have to see this <br/>
as an opportunity. But I'm kind of attached to my pencil-toting <br/>
trekker. I will think up some very nice reward if someone finds it <br/>
and gets it back to me!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!<br/>

We found it while driving back down the coast from Seattle. Funny -<br/>
we scoured the woods for a little green felt pouch, feeling certain<br/>
that we would never see it amongst the millions of green leaves on<br/>
the ground. Finally giving up because of the freezing wind, we<br/>
trudged back to the car with our heads hung low, only to see it on<br/>
the pavement right below the passenger side car door! As if waiting<br/>
for its ride home... Contact me artTrekker :) -Q<br/>
