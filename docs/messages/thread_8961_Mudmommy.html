#1 - Try Snowshoes<br/>

<br/>

Isn't he cute?  He wouldn't want you to know that he actually likes going<br/>
boxing with me - has his own stamp too.   Glad you are well and laughing<br/>
about your exploits now.  And I love the "Mudmommy" signature!<br/>

 I actually found a log while digging out my left foot and tried to <br/>
use it as a step under my right foot.<br/>
 I did use a bunch of shells to use as a scoop. Don't know if they <br/>
were clams or not.<br/>
 The only hot air was me blowing on my whistle and getting all <br/>
steamed up by my own stupidity!<br/>
 Finally, I use my good Coach backpack/bag as my letterboxing <br/>
backpack. How dumb is that? I really, really, really learn my <br/>
lessions the hard way. Well I am a Taurus, and my parents always said <br/>
I was bull headed.  <br/>
  Please thank your husband, I think he has good suggestions. <br/>
  LOL, Mudmommy <br/>
