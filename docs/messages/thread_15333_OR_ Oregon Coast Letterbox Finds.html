Last weekend my wife and I Journeyed down the Oregon Coast from <br/>
Lincoln City to Florence Letterboxing and Camping on the way.  Here <br/>
is what we found.<br/>
<br/>
8/21/03<br/>
We Love Lincoln City! - In great shape even though the brush nerby <br/>
had a fire<br/>
<br/>
Treasures of the Sea Series - We found boxes 2 and 3 but couldn't <br/>
find 1 and 4.  We think they are missing since the boxes were hidden <br/>
in such easy places.<br/>
<br/>
Devil's Punchbowl - Great Location.  Really cool stamp<br/>
<br/>
Beneath the Blue #2 - Really nice nature walk.  Another Great Funhog <br/>
Stamp.<br/>
<br/>
8/22/03<br/>
Yaquina Head Lighthouse - Cool area with great view, tidepools, and a <br/>
nice Ryan Stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Waterleaf - Nice little park tucked in Toledo.  We were a little <br/>
dissapointed though to find a store bought stamp.<br/>
<br/>
8/23/03<br/>
Nothing to Wear - One of the best views on the whole oregon coast in <br/>
my opinion.  The box was in a really easy to find place and was <br/>
almost full of passerby comments.  I wouldn't be supprised if the box <br/>
gets lost or stolen or thrown away in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
Yaquina Bay - Sad to say that this one appears to be missing.  Did <br/>
anyone find it?<br/>
<br/>
Cape Perpetua - A great stamp.  We found the box on top of the bushes <br/>
next to the trail.  We put it back in the rock hole the clue <br/>
indicates and covered it with rocks.  It is a heavily used path so I <br/>
hope it dosen't get carried away.  The Devil's Churn is really neat.<br/>
<br/>
Strawberry by the Sea - A nice little turnout from the highway.  We <br/>
found a Hitchiker here.<br/>
<br/>
Heceta Head Lighthouse - Another great Ryan stamp.  If anyone comes <br/>
here I recommend the Lighthouse tour(it's free).  The Lighthouse is <br/>
neat on the inside and the information the guides tell you about is <br/>
very interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Box ON!<br/>
