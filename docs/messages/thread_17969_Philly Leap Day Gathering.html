the drive up from MD!<br/>
And a special thanks to Scarab for introducing me to Randy on one of <br/>
the trails.  Great traveller Randy!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also wanted to say that I enjoyed the Philly area gathering. (I had <br/>
the choice of going to the Tacoma, Washington gathering or the Philly <br/>
one and I choose Philly so that I could meet some new faces!)<br/>
<br/>
The weather was fantastic, sunny and gorgeous. And I got sufficiently <br/>
muddy on the trails and I have a bright red sunburnt nose to show for <br/>
my day. I was only sorry that I couldn't stay longer!<br/>
<br/>
I will definitely have to get back out to the PA area for more <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
