<br/>
I wouldn't normally post this on the main board, however, I'm trying <br/>
to locate a (possibly) first-timr LN planter who left their brand <br/>
spanking new LB on a bench at the Berkeley Marina, in Berkeley, CA <br/>
last Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Would the owner/planter of this box kindly contact us offlist to<br/>
arrange for its return?<br/>
<br/>
We found it sitting on a bench at the Berkeley Marina on the 18th of<br/>
Jun, and were going to leave it with the Horseshoe Park box for<br/>
safekeeping, but that box has been vandalized. Soooo...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Pete aka Jiggs<br/>
