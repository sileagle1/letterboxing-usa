Pandora (Pandy) was recently seriously injured letterboxing. Her <br/>
right ankle was broken in two places. Her aunt, helping her get back <br/>
down the mountain, also fell and injured herself. I will let Pandy <br/>
tell her story next week when she gets back in the area. I understand <br/>
it was going for a letterbox in the Los Angeles area.<br/>
<br/>
If there truly is such a purple heart, Pandy deserves it. Please <br/>
contact me about this if you know details about what the award looks <br/>
like.<br/>

I saw this on the local news in LA and wondered if<br/>
they were letterboxing. Three new boxes have been<br/>
placed in Eaton Canyon and the people on the news fell<br/>
in this area! Was that Pandora? I hope she gets better<br/>
and someone should award her the purple heart. Can't<br/>
wait to hear her story. <br/>
Take care,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was wondering if this was the same injury we were told about being on the<br/>
news.  I remember it being asked if they could have been letterboxers.  I'm<br/>
so sorry to hear that it was (well, I guess I'm sorry it was anyone, not<br/>
just letterboxers).  I'm glad that it sounds as if Pandora will be okay.<br/>
Best wishes for a speedy recovery.  You'll be in our thoughts, and lets all<br/>
remember to think of the safety of our locations when we are making plants.<br/>
<br/>
I checked out the page for the purple heart.  Chuck's story made me smile.<br/>
Only a letterboxer would fall about 25 feet down a cliff, have to go to a<br/>
hospital, then insist on their party looking for the box still before they<br/>
even get off the mountainside.  I mean, Psychomommy's story always made me<br/>
giggle (you should have included the part about wearing the jacket home and<br/>
getting stopped in the story-it's okay to laugh when it's over isn't it?),<br/>
but this one really hit the mark.<br/>
<br/>
With all the recent talk over it being a "sickness," I think you just took<br/>
the cake.  You fell off a cliff, climbed out yourself, still looked for a<br/>
bit for the box, talked to all the hospital personnell about boxing and<br/>
spread the word, planned on going back for that same box for your next one,<br/>
and then last, but not least, used the whole nightmare experience as an<br/>
excuse for a new stamp!  Yeah, I think you've got it bad.  If there were<br/>
another award.  I nominate Chuck and Molly for it.  Somehow the "most sick"<br/>
of us all, just doesn't have the right ring.  I'm glad you weren't seriously<br/>
hurt, and can be here to help keep us smiling.<br/>

My husband was injured this past weekend (Saturday June 1st)  In <br/>
Orlando Florida in an unfortunate letterboxing accident.  Picture <br/>
this... you are searching through tall grass, when all of the sudden <br/>
you come upon the prized letterbox.  Happily you return home with <br/>
your trappings, strip off clothes to celebrate &amp; your wife says WHAT <br/>
IN THE ---- IS THAT!  As she bends over and yells there is a tick on <br/>
your -----.  Thankfully for her steady hand she is able to remove it <br/>
with a pair of tweezers and there is minumum blood loss.  It should <br/>
remind you of that scene ion Stand By Me where Gordy passes out from <br/>
the leech!  Now we will wait to see if the lyme disease fairies come <br/>
for a visit.  Please award him a Purple Heart for his own heart is a <br/>
bit faint!<br/>
