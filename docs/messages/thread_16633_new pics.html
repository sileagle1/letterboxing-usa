You should be happy that Yahoo is killing the webpages before you had <br/>
a chance to click on them, since I think there was probably a scam or <br/>
other malicious attempts involved.<br/>
<br/>
Two things tipped me off NOT to click on that link.  First, I didn't <br/>
know who the person was.  That suspicious in its own right.  And <br/>
second, there was nothing written about what the pics were about--a <br/>
glaring oversight.  Never follow an anonymous link that just <br/>
says "Picts here!", because the picts are more likely to be porn than <br/>
anything else!<br/>
<br/>
But in other news, is anyone going to post picts of the event?  I'd <br/>
like to see this masked man I've been hearing so much about.  =)<br/>

Gratefully, Kerjin posted a good link to those photos just today and I <br/>
enjoyed them immensely, all except for that LAST photo. An extraordinarily hideous <br/>
masked man, apparently in DRAG!<br/>
