                    <div class="plaintext-content">"You are somewhat like us," Blue Hawk Beldin was shaken out of his introspection by the <br/>
caged Buteo Lineatus, "You have been through trauma and need to heal."<br/>
<br/>
He had been thinking of how he found his way to these warm blooded cousins. Being the <br/>
time of year when many of his kind felt the need to move on, he took flight. The fact that <br/>
he was recovering from his make-over weakened had him to the influences of the <br/>
proselytizers. Thus befuddled, he started  in a direction which was not a normal migratory <br/>
path. As he tipped his wing to his snoring corporeal self (did he have to sleep with his <br/>
mouth open like that?) he flew West for 124 miles. The north wind blew him just a bit off <br/>
of his course and he took notice of  a Valley of Stone beneath him. He descended to the <br/>
Raptor Center he saw by a lake.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes, heal.. But how?" Beldin asked Buteo Lineatus.<br/>
<br/>
She stopped her preening and sharply advised, "Yours is more a trauma of the soul. You <br/>
split from your brother and need to heal your spirit to decide which path is for you; return, <br/>
reconcile, and rejoin or explore your freedom further."<br/>
<br/>
She persisted as Beldin blinked and stared at her, "Proceed west from here, fly over the <br/>
Troll Bridge then keep the meadow named for our kind to your right. You will find a <br/>
suitable place to roost nearby"<br/>
<br/>
After thanking her, Blue Hawk Beldin followed the wisdom of his cousin. He started to <br/>
descend as a #15 on a diamond the color of his cousin's shoulders was tacked to one side <br/>
of a tree. He then glided 293 to cross the trail with the markings the color of his tail and <br/>
passed over  the "J" post . He proceeded in the same direction to the large split pine tree.<br/>
<br/>
"Yes," he though as he perched 5' up under some rocks, "This is a perfect place to reflect <br/>
on my circumstances. Half of this tree lives as the other half sleeps on the ground." <br/>
