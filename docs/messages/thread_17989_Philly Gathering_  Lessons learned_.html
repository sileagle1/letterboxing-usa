this event! Not to mention Silent Doug for his virtual efforts.<br/>
<br/>
I bagged 6 boxes plus one HH, but the chance to meet a few obsessive <br/>
boxers made the day!  Quite a different dynamic hunting in group <br/>
formation.  The find is like a swarm of bees hunting for nectar and <br/>
stamping in becomes a communal, should I say, "hive-mind" experience.<br/>
<br/>
Bonus Lesson Learned # 1: Rooindie showed off her journal and its <br/>
scrapbook format.  Rather than dragging your precious Letterbox <br/>
Journal off on the mucky trails, bring along a separate stamping <br/>
book. You can make sure you get the stamp just right without ugly <br/>
smears, and later on cut it out and paste it in your Journal with a <br/>
diary entry kicker.<br/>
<br/>
Bonus Lesson Learned #2: Muk Luk had a cool idea too. Reserving a <br/>
whole page for stamps allows her to add a photo to capture the <br/>
moment....the photo can also cover up a bad imprint....creating an <br/>
impressive Journal.<br/>
<br/>
Bonus Lesson Learned #3: Gatherings can provide a central refueling <br/>
station for multiple finds!<br/>
