There are a couple of boxes that are nearly drivebys. On the weekend you will find that some boxes are difficult due to the numbers of picnickers. The series will take you most of the day at a neat park.Make sure you ride the Express. Don<br/>

Welcome, from a SoCal native but current New Yorker. If you're looking to <br/>
take a day trip after all your cross-country travels, there are boxes in <br/>
the Long Beach/Orange County area that wouldn't be too hard with a little <br/>
one in tow. You can always make it your mission to plant family-friendly <br/>
boxes in your area if there aren't many there right now, too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I learned a few things:  even with two adults, steep inclines are<br/>

<br/>
When I'd go out with my little ones at that age, a backpack was *so* much <br/>
easier to use than a front carrier, especially on inclines. The front <br/>
carrier will work great for the newborn when the time comes, though.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun letterboxing your way across the country!<br/>

I have seen a lot of people on trails with baby backpacks.  They are worn like a regular backpack but have a seat to put your kidlet in.  The kids seem to like it since most of them I have seen have been rocked to sleep by the walking motion.<br/>
<br/>
There are also some boxes that are easier to find because they are in more 'civilized' locations.  I recommend the Descanso Garden series and the El Dorado Park series.  Both of those are on pretty tame terrain with no steep climbs (the one exception might be the Chaparral Trail in Descanso but that one isn't terribly bad either).<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking of ways to plant some boxes in more urban (or suburban) areas.  I bought a bunch of really strong magnets and am going to start experimenting with them.  My only worry is that, in the post 9-11 environment, someone might be a little freaked by seeing someone placing a black box behind a payphone, power box, bus stop, etc. and call the police.<br/>
