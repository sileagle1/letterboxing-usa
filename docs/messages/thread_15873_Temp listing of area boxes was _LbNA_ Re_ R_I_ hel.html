those that are still working on the mystery but if you want a hand on <br/>
boxes I threw together a quick listing of boxes in the immediate <br/>
area.  There are even more in the surrounding communities if you are <br/>
staying longer or have done many of these.  Contact me (or Tom) <br/>
directly if you need additional advice.<br/>
