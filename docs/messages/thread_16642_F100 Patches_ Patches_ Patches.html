I was interested in buying some F100 patches, <br/>
and looked at the LBNA site.<br/>
<br/>
Why are they so expensive?<br/>
<br/>
They can be custom made for less than a dollar each.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the OFFICIAL and only place to get them,<br/>
<br/>
or can I order a bunch for less at a custom embroidery place?<br/>

<br/>
I have found the best price I could.  I have not found the logo patches for <br/>
less than a dollar each unless you buy 500.  I was able to bring the price down <br/>
by buying 200 last time but I haven't sold enough to recover my cost yet.  I <br/>
am selling them at cost .  No profit to me.  AS a matter of fact I am out <br/>
money for pastage and envelopes etc.  If you know of a place with a lower cost, <br/>
I'd love to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The merit badges could cost less if there was a market for 500 of each <br/>
denomination ... but there isn't.  I have found a convienient and the cheapest <br/>
embroider I could so far.  Let me know if you have another source.<br/>
<br/>
These are not official.  You can always order and design your own.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to hear from you.<br/>
<br/>

100 patches at $3 ($300) each seemed like not enough bang for too <br/>
much buck.  And I wouldn't dream of offering you less than what you <br/>
paid for them - and the hassle of handling and distribution.<br/>
<br/>
200 patches for $150 seemed the better route for me. <br/>
<br/>
I hope they turn out.<br/>
