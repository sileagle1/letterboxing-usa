                    <html><body>During the time that we have been letterboxing, we've noticed an increased tendency to place a greater number of boxes in a lesser amount of space.  We were always under the impression that it was unwise to place more than say, one box per mile in an area, due to the possibility of adverse impact.  We also thought that a lot of the appeal of letterboxing was the "challenge" involved in finding a box, as well as the enjoyment of the hike and being outdoors.  Has letterboxing become all about numbers?  Does anybody else agree that putting so many boxes in a small area cheapens both the sport and the area itself?<br/>

My response to that concern is that, if nothing else, this activity is enjoyed by <br/>
all kinds of people.    <br/>
<br/>
As a seasoned hiker, I welcome the challenges to find an isolated box - 4-5 <br/>
hours on terrain that is moderate/difficult.  Personally, I'd see such an event as <br/>
a personal challenge and a source of accomplishment.  But at the same time, <br/>
as a father of three young children, I'd not have my three young daughters on <br/>
such a trip,  it'd be enjoyable for neither them - nor I.  For that reason, a trip to <br/>
a state park with several hours in the woods be accompanied by several finds <br/>
would add to the experience for children.  And encource more of what this <br/>
country needs - more children outside enjoying our natural resources as <br/>
opposed to yet another day spent in front of a Disney DVD.<br/>
<br/>
So - I see there being room for both scenarios.<br/>
Peace.<br/>

I totally agree with this and would like to see both kinds of boxing experiences.  I have three small children, one who can't walk, and I'm not in the postpartum shape I'd like to be (euphamistically speaking...).  Right now a four-mile hike or vertical climb for the four of us is out of the question.  A two or three hour search is about what my kids can handle.  This greatly piques their interest and is replacing Pokemon as my boys' favorite activity.  This is what we can do.  If I were on my own, pre-kids, I'd prefer a couple of days plunged into the deep woods and I hope for that for people who can do it, but it's not for me now.<br/>
<br/>
I like the sprinkling of easy boxes in a good park to take my kids to.  This introduces them to an activity I hope they will love all their lives and will make them outdoorsmen   (and woman).  It gives them a chance to have a "win" at their level of difficulty.  I get a LOT of educational mileage out of this for them - we picked out a book of children's poetry at the library and are doing a series of boxes based on the poems.  My 3 and 6 year old sons choose the poem and design the stamps and help make them, we all go out together for a hike to choose the hiding place and my 6-year-old is learning to use the compass and I have him type the message containing the clues to be posted. We did part of the Dead Authors series in Vienna, VA and this has given an opportunity to interest my 6 year old in Louisa May Alcott and Mark Twain.<br/>

One of the nicest things about letterboxing is that you get to visit <br/>
recreation areas that are special to people who enjoy the out of <br/>
doors.  This includes not only well known areas, but also little <br/>
known areas.  The rest of us would not find out about there places <br/>
without an enjoyable purpose to go there, letterboxing of course. I <br/>
enjoy finding the lesser used parks, as well as hunting in the well <br/>
known ones.  I think one or two boxes in a park does just nicely to <br/>
provide an excuse for a visit and some hiking.  Younger children may <br/>
enjoy a number of finds with short distances between.  They have <br/>
shorter legs after all. I think both approaches are good. Of course <br/>
I will still be keeping my number count.<br/>
