This weekend We are going to attempt to do the entire "Four Directions" series on Mohawk Mtn. in Connecticut in one day. We have been told that it no one has ever done this(some have even said it can't be done). This being said, we knew we had to give it a try. <br/>
So please wish us well. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Way to go Quackers! We just love it when people take up their own personal challenges to see if they can stretch their limits a bit! We  only did one leg of the "Four Directions" on the afternoon of the gathering held there on Mohawk Mt. many years ago, so when we went back a month or so after that to do the rest, we only had one car and had to hike all the other legs in both directions - old AT and new AT! However, if you use the "two-car system" and plan things out to do each leg only once and drive "seamlessly" between sections, bet you can do it all in one day! Best wishes for enjoying those beautiful piney trails of far northwestern CT!<br/>
