Witchiepoo for a little local letterboxing.  Brrr, was it cold.<br/>
<br/>
We were the first to log in to Bananaconda.  It's a great stamp - ya <br/>
gotta see it.  <br/>
<br/>
We also found Mother Goose and a hitchhiker with an unusual name that <br/>
we took to be BannyrCai. Mother Goose had become dislodged from her <br/>
hiding place because of all the recent rain but we placed her back and <br/>
weighed her down with a rock. The stamp is a hand carved picture of <br/>
you know who.  Witchiepoo will move the Hitchhiker.  We also found, by <br/>
complete surprise, a geocache.<br/>
<br/>
We then went over to Ghost Castle.  We think we were the first to log <br/>
in there but the Unlucky Hitchhiker was already there.  We don't know <br/>
who moved it or when because there was no log in.  The Ghost Castle is <br/>
a nice stamp too - The Doubtful Guests have become pretty intricate in <br/>
their carvings.  Knights of Columbo will move the Hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
So in about 2 hours time we found 3 boxes at three different sites, <br/>
were the first to log into 2 of them, and found 2 hitchhikers.  <br/>

many boxes, it is hard to keep track!<br/>

Congratulations on all your finds AND hitchhikers.  Very exciting (in a good <br/>

know we have no idea where we are way)<br/>

Maybe we should team up after all.  Although, I have to admit that my luck <br/>
tends to rub off and not the other way around.  We always lose our luggage <br/>
(well, the airlines do) and when we're with people who have never had that <br/>
problem before, their's gets lost too! Then there's the time we had to fight <br/>
our way in to see Shamu the whale, and lost, but that's another story....)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we'll go out over Thanksgiving break.  We'll have to work off all them <br/>
good eats somehow!<br/>

<p>DL and my self Schizokeet left on Saturday to find Top Secret but the park was closed for hunting so we went to Ft. Belvoir where we found 4 boxes then as it was getting dark we headed to Bananaconda and stamped in after all you guys about 5pm.  Sunday we headed back for Top Secret Our first Mystery box and then headed out to Golf Branch Nature center.  I had the first stamp but hadn't found the second now I have both.  The Old boiler was recently replaced but on our way down the rocks DL found the origingal Old boiler stamp so we now have 2 old boiler stamps. DL put it back inthe original place with the new stamp and log.  It was quite dark as we were walking back up the trail at 5:15 Luckly it is not a park you can get locked into.<br/><br/></p></div>

I put Unlucky hitchhiker in it when I placed it.  I'm not familiar <br/>
with the login procedures so that's the confusion.<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently in Sarasota, FL desperate to find a letterbox but <br/>
having no luck with poor orphans no longer in place.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to trying some cold letterboxing when I return.  <br/>
Or am I?<br/>

<p>Well DiscLava really found it but we were travling together.  I think you should send one on a journy as the clues state it could have been part of a ship :^)  It would be fun.  Both stamps look very cool.  They are or together in the box under the rocks <br/><br/></p></div>
