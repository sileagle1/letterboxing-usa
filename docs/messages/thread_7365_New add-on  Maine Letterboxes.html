<center><b>AROOSTOOK STATE 
PARK LETTERBOXES(3)</b> <br/><b>PRESQUE ISLE, 
MAINE</b></center>
<center><strong>Aroostook County</strong></center>
<p>This letterbox series began with the Echo Lake Letterbox, planted on August 
19th, 2001.  Two more letterboxes have been added on since August 
20th, 2002. 
</p><p>Follow Rt. 1 South from center of Presqu'isle to 
Aroostock State Park.  Follow signs.  Stop at the entry gate and pay 
the park ranger a minimal entry fee and be sure to pick up a brochure and map of 
the park.  This is a lovely park where for a mere dollar or two, you can 
enjoy a picnic area, swimming area (with lifeguard in season), and great hiking 
trails.  There also is a campground and X-country trails for winter 
activities.  Bring a picnic lunch and enjoy some time in this great 
park. <b> </b> </p>
<p><b>CLUES</b> <br/><br/>To get to what you're looking 
for, park in the parking lot by the swimming area, and head SW onto the 
Quaquahog Nature Trail.  Take time to find out what "Quaquajo" means.  
At fork, head to North Peak, 1 mile.  Be careful not to follow X-country 
ski trail.  Follow the blue blaze up and up.  This is a wonderful 
steep trail.  Can you just imagine what this would be like in the 
winter?  You would need ice picks attached to your shoes!!   
<br/>  <br/>At the T, head North (duh) up the trail to the North peak.  
When you almost at the end, look for an overlook opening on the left.  
Immediately after this opening, take a small path off to the right, 120'.  
Go 15 paces SE.  On the left, spot a small grove of lovely white 
birch.  Find the Echo Lake Letterbox hidden in the rocks to 
the left.  Please stamp up and rehide carefully.  Enjoy the view of 
Presqu'isle from the North peak and rest a moment.  Go ahead and shout from 
the top and maybe you'll hear your echo.  The day we were here, there was a 
whole family of kids shouting.  It was funny actually because we could hear 
them all the way up the trail. <br/>  <br/>To get to the next 
letterbox, head towards the South peak.  Follow the signs.  You 
will go downhill and then uphill as you cross between peaks.  This 
part of the trail is about a mile. As you near the end of this trail,  
you will see another set of signs ahead of you indicating the peaks and the 
campground.  Look to the right for a pile of short logs against a 
tree.  Look low for the Quaquajo Letterbox.  You don't need to 
move any logs, reach under behind the rock.  Stamp in and replace 
carefully.  Go check out the South Peak. </p>
<p>Now, you'll have to make a decision about how to get down.  This is 
where it gets like the Amazing Race where you have to decide between the 
long and safe way, or the short and risky way.  Choice number 1 is to 
go down a 3/4 mile, extremely steep, slippery, rocky, and direct route 
to the camping area.  Choice number 2 is to go back the way you came, and 
you know what that's like already.  (Our family made it down 
choice #1, carefully picking our way, and sometimes going off the trail, 
holding onto anything we could grasp.  Good shoes and strong knees and legs 
are a must.)</p>
<p>Now onto Box # 3.  We made this one easy to make up for getting down 
from #2.  Go to the boat launch.  Facing the lake, 
look left to the white cedar by the boat launch driveway.  Look low 
under a rock, under the boughs of this tree for the Aroostook State Park 
Letterbox. Cover carefully after stamping in.    </p>
<p> We hope you enjoy your visit at Aroostock State Park as much as we 
did.  Be sure to look for the James Schoolhouse Letterbox just up the 
road.<br/>  <br/>Comments or problems?  E-mail us at <a href="mailto:pineknoll@snet.net">pineknoll@snet.net</a>. <br/>Letterbox 1 planted
