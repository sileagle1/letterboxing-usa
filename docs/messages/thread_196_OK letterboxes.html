Thanks for alerting me to the previous discussion re: compass <br/>
bearings.<br/>
<br/>
Since most (now anyway) of my boxes will be getting student <br/>
traffic from my geography course, and since I want them to get <br/>
used to adjusting for declination, I needed, and still do need, to <br/>
keep those bearings true.  But I do understand your issue with it.  <br/>
It makes things much more complex for the amatuer compass <br/>
reader.<br/>
<br/>
Theme.  I suppose the walk has something of a biographical <br/>
theme.  Some of my avocational loves are on those stamps--<br/>
Tolkien, Anasazi, and the romantic notion of the Celts.  The <br/>
Dragonthorn stamp is a celtic dragon coupled with the <br/>
Scandinavian rune Thorn--allegedly denoting "protection."  Perhaps <br/>
a bit of symbol spell casting on that box. Really when I sat down to <br/>
carve stamps last semester, I dug down for some artistic <br/>
inspiration and those are what I came up with.  <br/>
<br/>
The long term goal of this walk is for each class of students to <br/>
place their own box on the walk to enlarge it and to make it fun for <br/>
me too.<br/>

Welcome to the hobby!!  Being an ''All 50 by Y2K'' fanatic, let me say how<br/>
great it looks to see that the Letterbox USA map now has your state colored<br/>
in!!  Fills in that space between my home state of Kansas and the very active<br/>
letterboxing state of Texas so nicely!!!!    Congratulations!<br/>
       :-D<br/>

&gt; Since most of my boxes will be getting student <br/>

<br/>
I think the general consensus in this group is that it's cool to do it however<br/>
you prefer.  Part of the fun is that there are no right or wrong ways to do<br/>
this.  If no designation is made, most of us are going to assume that you are<br/>
using magnetic bearings.  If true bearings are used, it is appreciated when<br/>
the clues state this fact and include the declination, just as you have done<br/>
at SNU.  I realize this is probably the exact opposite of how most<br/>
orienteering folks see the issue... but it helps keep letterboxing in touch<br/>
with the average citizen.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  The long term goal of this walk is for each class of students to <br/>
&gt;  place their own box on the walk to enlarge it and to make it fun for <br/>
&gt;  me too.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure they will... be sure to keep us informed of future additions!!!<br/>
Hmmm... I wonder how far it is from my sis-in-law's house in Wichita to<br/>
SNU...?<br/>
<br/>
