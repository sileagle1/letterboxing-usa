<br/>
My daughters and I headed out to Palo Alto to try our hand at letterboxing.<br/>
I've placed three myself, but this was my first try looking for them.  Boxes<br/>
1 was kind of difficult to find.  The clues sent us in the wrong direction,<br/>
but once he heard the "dragon" we got on track.  Box #2 was not difficult to<br/>
find.  Box #3 was a little harder as you had to look "really low" to find<br/>
it.  Box #4 was the problem.  The clues were easy, and we found what we<br/>
think was the hidding spot (clump of rocks) but no letterbox could be found.<br/>
We re-did the clue for #4 and it was pretty obvious were the box was<br/>
supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
So, Linda, I would suggest going out and seeing if Box #4 is really gone,<br/>
has just been moved, or I totally missed it.<br/>
<br/>
And just so you know, the only entries in the books were by Lone Wolf and<br/>
myself.  Box #1 was missing a book, but the rest was there.  About your<br/>
stamps in the boxes, boy, they are big.<br/>
<br/>
So, I can say that letterboxes do disappear.  I would suggest keeping this<br/>
in mind and not invest a whole lot in the boxes and contents.  The<br/>
letterboxes I placed were created with this in mind and done very<br/>
inexpensively (and a lot smaller than Linda's).<br/>

I've forwarded your message to Linda.  She has not had time to be<br/>
active on the list lately, but I'm sure will look into the issues you<br/>
raise.<br/>
<br/>
I'll post if I hear anything, unless she does.<br/>
