<br/>
i have scouted out a place for a letterbox...this would be my first...<br/>
<br/>
ok questions questions questions....<br/>
<br/>
first i also read the geocaching website also..i do not have a gps unit so i use the clues/hints given and attempt the find...now with geocaching you find the box and you can if u wish leave something/take something in/out of the box and sign the logbook..<br/>
<br/>
letterbox you sign the logbook and stamp with each others stamps...<br/>
<br/>
ok now...what i was thinking was a bit of combining the two elements...making the letterbox a theme box....which i mean...----logbook---stamp (store bought, i cant make the carving work for me yet)..inkpad...pen/pencil...Now for the theme part...i do rubberstamping and i was thinking of doing some bookmarks...nothing fancy ...just nice...and i would put those in the letterbox and anyone finding the box could take one of my bookmarks and leave one that they made/decorated with rubberstamps or stickers on cardstock....sign the logbook...and stamp the log books as usual....<br/>
<br/>
do you think this is a do=able idea??..i was thinking size of 2 1/2 in wide by 6 to 6 1/2 in long...<br/>
<br/>
please let me know your thoughts<br/>
thanks <br/>

Hello Wanda and welcome to letterboxing. We have found a couple letterboxes in eastern CT that give the finder a gift. I remember 1 that had free bookmarks, a couple that had dog treets for those letterboxing with dogs, 1 had a limited number of hand made pins. I have a box planted bot not listed yet that gives everyone a small gift. It does not happen often but these boxes do exist and are a nice surprise when you find one. Your idea about bookmarks is a very good one. Go for it.....Chuck and Molly in Mansfield CT<br/>
