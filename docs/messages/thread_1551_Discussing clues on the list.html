                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've noticed a disturbing trend of discussing clues and asking for <br/>
hints on the list.  I think this is totally inappropriate in this <br/>
public space.  It is likely to violate the intent of the clue <br/>
writer.  If someone feels they truly need some assistance in finding <br/>
a particular box, they should make an inquiry OFF-LIST to the person <br/>
who hid the box.  They should however be prepared to have their <br/>
request ignored if the box owner so chooses.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that some are interested only in collecting stamps, and if <br/>
they fail, for whatever reason, they weren't succesful.  Some of my <br/>
best letterboxing experiences include trips where I haven't found the <br/>
box.  Maybe something about the journey not the destination...<br/>
<br/>
While I'm at it...   I notice a lot of recent boxes have rather <br/>
simple clues, what I'd call "drive-by" boxes:  You drive up, follow a <br/>
trail and pick up a stamp.  I feel there's room for these types of <br/>
easy boxes (I have children too, and they do like instant <br/>
gratification), but I see a couple of dangers.  One is that since <br/>
these boxes are so easy to find, they are also much more likely to be <br/>
vandalized or dissappear (especially if there are no compass bearings <br/>
involved in solving them).  Secondly, it seems to create an <br/>
expectation that all boxes should easily be found.  There are many <br/>
boxes out there, particularly mapsurfer's, Orient Express' and Drew's <br/>
to name a few, that require some real puzzle solving to figure them <br/>
out.  Having found some of these boxes, I can attest that they are <br/>
much more rewarding to find (and less likely to dissappear).<br/>

Well, I don't always think the clues themselves should be hard, but<br/>
the combination of box placement and the clues.... some of the most<br/>
rewarding letterboxes I've found required (a) a *lot* of driving,<br/>
some more than a day's travel for the out-west boxes (b) long and<br/>
grueling (but beautiful) hikes to the letterbox (c) hard clues or (d)<br/>
a combination of the above.<br/>
<br/>
The joy is in working hard to find the boxes, and often the travel<br/>
along the way.  It doesn't just have to be hard clues.  :)<br/>

    I agree wholeheartedly with your praise for letterboxing getting people<br/>
outside again.  Seems like we need a goal as we get older (are we getting<br/>
older?)  Actually, even my daughter is motivated by perhaps finding a box.<br/>
We are all highly entertained when meeting other people in the woods that<br/>
are clearly not letterboxing.  Makes us chuckle to ourselves that we "have a<br/>
secret" from the better part of the world.<br/>
    Sorry if people were offended by her asking about clues.  She's only 12<br/>
and had read other peoples' requests, so added her own.  We've since<br/>
discussed it and agree that it will not happen again.<br/>
    On another note, we found the hitchhiker Home is Where the Heart Is at<br/>
Gillette Castle.  Can't wait to plant it this weekend if the weather<br/>
cooperates.    Our first hitchhiker, which caused great celebration.  If we<br/>
weren't already hooked, this would have done it for sure!  Happy<br/>
Letterboxing.  Ann T<br/>
