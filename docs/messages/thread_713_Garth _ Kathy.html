                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi from another relatively new letterboxer.  My kids and I and friends that <br/>
we introduced Letterboxing to have only been doing this since the beginning <br/>
of summer.  I have one suggestion (well maybe two),  please consider leaving <br/>
behind a few boxes that are "kid friendly."  This is a great hobby for adults <br/>
and kids ... but many of the boxes are a little too hard for gradeschoolers, <br/>
and my kids are exhausted before we get to the box,  so maybe planting a few <br/>
"lower level" boxes would be a possibility.  One problem, it seems that the <br/>
easier the boxes are to find ... the easier they are to find period.  We have <br/>
lost 6 out of the first thirteen we planted (one of them twice).  I learned <br/>
to make my boxes seem "not out of the ordinary."  I've started using small <br/>
bird houses when I can.  I can only hope they last longer.<br/>
<br/>
Since you travel around maybe the next time you hit the Metro St. Louis area <br/>
(where we are from)  or the San Antonio Texas area (where some friends and <br/>
newly initiated Letterboxers are moving).  There are no recorded boxes hidden <br/>
in the Alamo area.<br/>
<br/>
What a great job you two have.  I checked out your site ...  looks like you <br/>
two have a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Many Blessings,  Mohmers<br/>
