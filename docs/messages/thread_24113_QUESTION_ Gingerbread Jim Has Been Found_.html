                    <div class="plaintext-content">the whole deal with Gingerbread jim had been a story for sometime. it also is a series of boxes planted in NH, before called "saving Jim", now called "the adventures of gingerbread jim - #10 - saving jim"<br/>
<br/>
  as it has seemed to be much a story to get some through the harsh winter, there has been a story following the kidnapping for awhile. originally, he was to be kidnapped and held in san diego. with clues, LBers were to go find him there, and bring him back to NH, by means of replanting the box closer to NH when it is found. the actual box went missing in the mail, so i recarved and started a kidnapping series closer to home.<br/>
<br/>
  for some of you that have been following, Gingerbread jim has made it to the hospital, and isn't doing so hot. there are signs that he may not make it. we all hope for the best for Jim. he has been through enough already.<br/>
