O'Leary, Prince Edward Island, Canada<br/>
<br/>
Planted by "the Family"(Yuzi, CERK, VFTR, butterbaby, spunky spaniel, <br/>
and rtrw) on August 12th, 2002.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Time - 10 minutes<br/>
Difficulty - easy<br/>
Distance - less than a football field<br/>
<br/>
Where can you have your picture taken by a fiberglass pototo that's<br/>
14 feet high?  Why the Prince Edward Island Potato Museum, of course. <br/>
<br/>
The musem was fun and informative, and we learned a lot about this <br/>
important PEI industry.  It also helped us appreciate the MANY potato <br/>
fields we saw on our PEI vacation.  They have a good website at   <br/>
peipotatomuseum.com. Check here for hours and dates of operation. <br/>
After you enjoy the museum (or if by some fluke of nature don't want <br/>
to know more about the potato), you can find our box outside.  <br/>
<br/>
Pull all the way into the parking lot and park facing away from the <br/>
museum.  There is a field with a pretty gazebo directly in front of <br/>
you.  Go to the gazebo steps and take a left.  At the corner turn <br/>
right.  The prize for which you are searching is under the central <br/>
support on that side.  Gloves may be helpful.  We saw a spider.  Have <br/>
a seat, stamp up and rehide well. Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
We are not local at all, so please help us keep this box updated and <br/>
dry.  If we can help you in this or you'd like to email us, please<br/>
do. rtrw@attbi.com <br/>
