                    <html><body>What a fabulous weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you SO much to Newbe for his excellent organization of all the fun.  You truly did a fabulous job and I know that we are all deeply grateful!<br/>
<br/>
I am so excited that I FINALLY got to meet my personal heros - The Apple Dumpling Gang.  It was like meeting celebrities!  Sarah, your talent amazes me.  I hope that we all can get together again soon.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like this to be my official apology to The ADG and to Psychomommy and the Turtle.  I am SO sorry about the campsite number screw up.  I am taking comfort in the fact that Scott was confused too.  And Karin- we too drove up and said hi to the folks at 27 and were wondering what they were doing in our campsite!<br/>
<br/>
I was so glad we ran into the ADG on the trail on Sunday!  I was glad we got to spend a little more time together.<br/>
<br/>
Scott and I also found all 8 boxes in the park - after only minor arguing!  (And now there are two more???  MUST GO BACK!!)  We were also lucky enough to find a Cuckoo Clue in one of the boxes too!  We also found the two very beautiful Hollywood Cemetery stamps.  And I have officially crossed the line into letterboxing madness - we found the Carillon stamp in the dark using flashlights.  Suprisingly enough - I think  Scott would have liked to have found all of the rest of the Richmond boxes in the dark.  I had to gently remind him that we had a two hour drive home!  It's funny that it took me a very long time to convince him to go with me this weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone for making it such a wonderful weekend.<br/>
