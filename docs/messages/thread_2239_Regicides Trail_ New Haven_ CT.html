Located in West Ridge State Park, New Haven, CT (New Haven County)<br/>
Easy; takes about one hour; historic site. <br/>
<br/>
Trekkers could also enjoy the 6-mile Blue Trail which is touted in the Connecticut Walk Book as being "one of<br/>
CT's most spectacular cliff walks." The Walk Book also states that the paved road running the length of the<br/>
ridge is open in summer, but they no longer allow motor vehicles up there, to reduce impact on the local fauna<br/>
(we saw many deer). Bikes are allowed. The Nature Center is a great side attraction for the kids, open<br/>
weekdays until 5 and Sat. 11-3.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the center of Southern CT State University, take Wintergreen Avenue and follow signs to West<br/>
Ridge State Park, or West Rock Nature Center.  If the parking at the Park is chained off, park at the Nature<br/>
Center, just down and across from the Park entrance. <br/>
<br/>
Enter the Park and walk up the road heading south. Watch for and follow the Green Trail on the right (first<br/>
blaze on the ground). The Green Trail ends where the Blue Trail comes to the drive near the Judges Cave.  If<br/>
you climb up on the "cave" and look due south, you will see a pile of rocks near the edge of the clearing. Go<br/>
to it. The box is stashed under a "trapdoor" style rock to the right (330) of the rock pile.<br/>
<br/>
The Cave was struck by lightning in the mid-1800s and so does not have much of a chamber anymore. When it was<br/>
used by the two judges, it was high enough inside to them to stand and have two beds.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just came back from visiting the Regicides Trail letterbox.  The box is<br/>
alive and well.  It is great to have day out in a park like that and learn<br/>
something too.  Thanks Aili &amp; Bruce for the history and a very appropriate<br/>
stamp.  If someone is not familiar with Southern Connecticut State<br/>
University you can get there by taking the Route 10 exit off of I95, stay on<br/>
Route 10 until you reach Fitch, turn right on Fitch and Wintergreen is a<br/>
left when you reach S.C.S.U.  The park and the history lesson are worth the<br/>
trip.  I would also recommend you consider taking the blue trail along the<br/>
ridge either on the way out or the way back, the views are spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
One note on the clues:  The vegetation has grown up so much that the rock<br/>
pile referenced in the final clue is no longer visible from the top of the<br/>
"cave", I just sighted some trees from the top due south, walked to them and<br/>
found the  rock pile when I reached the trees I had sighted.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad you liked our stamp, etc. The story of the Three Judges has <br/>
been, to me, an example of what we "Yanks" will go through to gain <br/>
and keep our liberties. Few may know that the town of Old Saybrook <br/>
was begun as a refuge for Oliver Cromwell and his supporters, though <br/>
the "Lord Protector" never made it here. Long before the seeds of <br/>
Revolution were sown, we held our freedom and independence very dear.<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways to reach the park, it just seemed finding one's <br/>
best way to the college was easiest. From the Merritt Parkway, Exit <br/>
60-Dixwell Ave, you will see signs on the right just a bit south of <br/>
the off-ramps, which lead you though a prettier neighborhood, though <br/>
the way is probably longer.  Oh, and the Merritt cuts under, <br/>
not through, the park.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a map for any interested, the entrance to the park being near <br/>
Tierney Rd.<br/>
