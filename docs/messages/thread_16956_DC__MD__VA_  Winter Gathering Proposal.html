<br/>
Where?  It should be close to Metro, have good parking, and be big <br/>
enough for kids to run around in.  And maybe even have some boxing <br/>
nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Stacks House mystery box location (DC) <br/>
   Great place but parking could be difficult.  Near Metro.  One box <br/>
indoors on site.  Could talk about and send people of to do Repent <br/>
series<br/>
<br/>
Pentagon City Mall Food Court (VA)<br/>
   Great parking.  On Metro.  One box indoors on site.  Plenty of <br/>
room.<br/>
<br/>
Tysons II Galleria (VA)<br/>
   Great parking.  Not near Metro.  Plenty of room to run around.  <br/>
Boxes around the area.<br/>
<br/>
What does everyone think?<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile is anyone signed up to recieve the Scoutdog F100 stamp? I <br/>
really like the idea of having a quick gathering for anyone to stamp <br/>
it and exchange whenever it is in the area.<br/>

Subject: DC:/MD:/VA:  Winter Gathering Proposal<br/>
<br/>
It's been a while since we got together.  I am inspired by CT to<br/>
propose a winter gathering.  Our first gathering was winter.<br/>
<br/>
After 2nd week in January?  February?<br/>
<br/>
<snip><br/>
<br/>
I'm biased, perhaps, but may I suggest either College Park or Greenbelt, MD?<br/>
There are several boxes in the Lake Artemesia area within walking distance<br/>
from the College Park metro, and 94th Aerosquadron Restaurant would be a<br/>
good choice for spacious eatery nearby.<br/>
<br/>
There are also at least 5 live boxes in Greenbelt around Buddy Attick<br/>
Park/Greenbelt Lake. Don't know about eateries in Old Greenbelt (near the<br/>
park), and that area is also less convenient to the metro stop, but if few<br/>
plan on taking the metro, that might be less a concern. And Greenbelt does<br/>
have a certain Woody-Guthrie-power-to-the-people-esque charm that all DC<br/>
Metro residents should experience at least once in their lifetime.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Would love to get together!  I can't do the weekends of 1/31 or 2/28 at all.  I will also be busy either 2/21 or 2/22.  I may be unavailable the weekend of 1/10 as well.  And 2/14 is a Saturday Valentine's Day, which doesn't seem the optimal choice.  <br/>
<br/>
Would be bringing two very little ones - almost 5 by that time and almost 2 by that time.  Littler one would need a stroller if it's longer than a very short get-together, s something stroller-friendly is a must for us.  Prefer not going downtown unless parking is easy.  Anything at/in the Building Museum would be OK, though - that place is pretty cool &amp; has plenty of room for the kids to blow off steam.  Maybe we could go there on one of their event days?<br/>
<br/>
Hope it works out!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think a gathering the January 17 or 24 would be great! I like the <br/>
idea of doing one in MD or DC, since the last one was in VA. <br/>
I agree Greenbelt is a lovely area. And there are lots of series <br/>
close by in Beltsville/CollegePark area. I don't know if Lake <br/>
Artemasia has a pavillion of any sort, but Buddy Attick has at least <br/>
a few picnic tables, and a decent amount of parking. And half way <br/>
around the lake you can cross overthrough the ball fields to the Co-<br/>
op shopping area where there is a darling cafe and possibly some <br/>
other eateries.(also metro busses run through there often) That would <br/>
be my vote, even though I have gotten a lot of the boxes in that <br/>
area! <br/>
