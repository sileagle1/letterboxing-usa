                    <div class="plaintext-content">I cannot take another minute of what goes on in this group. It was bad <br/>
enough when I was shamed for posting my opinion, a positive opinion, <br/>
not too long ago. Due to that I have not posted here in a while, but <br/>
have lurked in the shadows, always watching and listening. I feel I <br/>
just can't take this nonsense any longer. I will stick to my regional <br/>
group, people which are wonderful and don't embrace the behavior that <br/>
goes on here. I hope you people are very proud of yourselves, pushing <br/>
out people who don't want to listen to this type of insulting and rude <br/>
chatter. You should all be reminded that this is a letterboxing board, <br/>
not a place to cut people down. My children behave better than some of <br/>
you. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">After much consideration, I am also unsubscribing from<br/>
this group.  I joined many years ago, and unsubscribed<br/>
due to the constant bickering and flaming that was<br/>
going on.  I resubscribed some months back, hoping<br/>
things had changed.  And for a while, they really and<br/>
truly did.<br/>
<br/>
Once all of the fuss dies down, I plan on<br/>
resubscribing.  I've met some really great 'boxers in<br/>
this group and learned a TON of new stuff about<br/>
letterboxing.  I wish all the people on this list lots<br/>
of sunny days and easy to follow clues (but not too<br/>
easy!!)  And I sincerely hope that all involved in<br/>
this mess can come to some type of mutually accepted<br/>
ending.<br/>
<br/>
I will stay active on the regional and "specialty"<br/>
boxing groups, and hope to stay in touch with the<br/>
folks that I've met through this group.  When this all<br/>
dies down, if someone wants to e-mail me off-list and<br/>
let me know, I'll be back.  Probably ....<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to all<br/>
