trip!  Were had planned on finding the Dragon Krakow but got a very <br/>
late jump on the day and by the time we got home from the gym and got <br/>
cleaned up it was already after 2:00pm. ANyways, great stamps and a <br/>
nice easy walk!<br/>
<br/>
Also checked our new drive-up to see that Psychokiwis and Butterfly <br/>
(with grandson in tow) are the first visitors!  Thanks for stopping <br/>
by!<br/>
