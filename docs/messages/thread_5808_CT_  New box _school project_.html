East Windsor Intermediate School<br/>

<br/>
     A 3rd grader's self-initiated project to introduce fellow <br/>
classmates and local families to letterboxing.<br/>
     Park in front parking lot of EWIS (off Main Street in Broad <br/>
Brook).  Start on the front main sidewalk, below East Windsor <br/>
Intermediate School sign, facing the parking lot.  Walk to your right <br/>
along the building's brick wall.  Pass three large trees (on your <br/>
left).  Soon you will see a short bushy shrub (before the fence).  <br/>
Walk to the right by brick wall and look under the shrub.  There you <br/>
will find the treasure among the leaves!<br/>
     Log in the journal book and securely replace all items for <br/>
others to find.  Place it carefully back, out of sight with a few <br/>
leaves scattered on top.<br/>
<br/>
                Happy Letterboxing*.. Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
*Please not during school hours when classes are in session, Thank <br/>
You.<br/>
