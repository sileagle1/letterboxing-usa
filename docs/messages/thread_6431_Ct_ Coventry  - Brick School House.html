By leader of the Pack<br/>
<br/>
The Brick School House<br/>
<br/>
In Coventry turn  from Rte 44 to North River Rd. this turn is at the <br/>
Glass Muesam site. 44 Bisects N. River so take the north side with <br/>
the colonial house not the brick house.  When the road comes to a  Y <br/>
bear right to the stop sign.  Then turn right again  and follow this <br/>
until you come to the small Brick School  House. Park out of the <br/>
neighbors way. This is a historic muesam  owned by Coventry <br/>
Historical Society and a very photogenic place.  A Storm came <br/>
whistlin through and tore down the large tree that formerly hid our <br/>
treasure. It crushed the old two room outhouse that was part of the <br/>
first set of clues.  So here we go another try.  Stand behind the <br/>
school  see where the tree came down and the few stones remaining of <br/>
the outhouse founation. Now let your eye travel  to the left . There <br/>
is a large Maple which has stood here long enough to remember the <br/>
laughter of children at recess.  In front of the tree in the fern <br/>
garden your quest is hidden under rock carefully placed.  Please <br/>
remove and stamp at your car then seal tightly and rehide exactly.  <br/>
Do not disturb the garden.  As always Have Fun and be safe.<br/>
