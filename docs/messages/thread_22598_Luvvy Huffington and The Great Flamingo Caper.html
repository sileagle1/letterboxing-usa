<br/>
It is with great sadness that I tell you that Sue &amp; I had the<br/>
opportunity to visit with Luvvy Huffington this weekend. Suffice it to<br/>
say that she is half of her former self. When we entered her room,<br/>
Luvvy  was in a stupor, folding napkins in the shape of little<br/>
flamingos, just as she was shown many years ago by Lady Prisspot at<br/>
LP's finishing school.<br/>
<br/>
This note is to ask all of you to please help Luvvy find Percival on<br/>
October 1 at the Great Urban Plastic Pink Flamingo Caper in<br/>
Leominster, MA. Every letterboxing detective with a sharp eye and keen<br/>
wit is needed to ensure that we can finally hunt out Percival and<br/>
reunite him with his mistress, Luvvy.<br/>
<br/>
For further details, please check Atlas Quest Events Page and our<br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
We emplory you to help - we don't know how long Luvvy can hang on! Her<br/>
little hands are getting chapped from the repetitive motion of the<br/>
napkin-folding!<br/>
