to get started, Microsoft Word (probably other editors too) is one <br/>
way. You are limited to keeping it relatively simple, but just <br/>
generate a doc as normal and save as a html file. You can insert <br/>
pictures and links pretty easily. So if you know Word, you can make a <br/>
webpage without having to know html.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Will it be better for you if I attempt to make my own letterbox <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The best part about creating your own webpage for the clues (in my <br/>
&gt; opinion), is that you can make them look exactly like YOU want.  <br/>
One <br/>
&gt; of the 'features' I put on all my clues is their current status: <br/>
&gt; Confirmed missing, status unknown, or confirmed alive and well.  It <br/>
&gt; gets updated immediately that way, and nobody has to spend time <br/>
&gt; wacking through poison oak to learn the box was already reported <br/>
&gt; missing two months ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Once you start making your own clue pages, you'll wonder how you <br/>
ever <br/>
&gt; got by without doing so!  You'll start adding photos from pictures <br/>
&gt; you took while hiding the box, create lists of boxes you've found <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; placed, and about a hundred other things that aren't really <br/>
practical <br/>
&gt; while posting clues to the talk list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And knowing even the basics of HTML and creating webpages--it's a <br/>
&gt; FANTASTIC skill to have in this day and age!  It's far easier than <br/>
&gt; most people would imagine.  One of my favorite books is "HTML for <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; World Wide Web" by Elizabeth Castro--it's a great tutorial and <br/>
&gt; reference and incredibly easy to understand.  Amazon.com has it at <br/>
&gt; http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-<br/>
&gt; /0321130073/qid=1041984971/sr=2-1/104-2746672-0614317?<br/>
&gt; v=glance&amp;s=books if you want to check it out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want to really go overboard and put in stuff like rollovers <br/>
&gt; (which is surprisingly easy to do), "JavaScript for the World Wide <br/>
&gt; Web" is wonderful.  I don't actually use it very much because I <br/>
&gt; prefer to know how JavaScript actually works rather than just copy <br/>
&gt; code to do something (and other books are better for that), but <br/>
&gt; that's a heck of a lot more complicated.  For most people, this <br/>
book <br/>
&gt; is perfect to give their webpage an extra flair.  =)<br/>

&gt; webpage.  ;o)<br/>
