These two boxes were mentioned as being on NPS land; "Skipper Finds a <br/>
Home" (Cowpens National Battlefield) and "Kings Mountain" (Kings <br/>
Mountain National Military Park).  These are being used as fodder to <br/>
ram H3777 through.  Could someone with some authority contact the <br/>
owners of these two boxes and request they be removed if in fact are <br/>
placed without the proper permission?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

Yes, we are working on the geocaching side.<br/>

There IS no one with authority in the <br/>
world of letterboxing... Most of us know <br/>
that NPS land is out of bounds. If these <br/>
folks choose to disobey, there's nothing <br/>
anyone else can do about it. The best <br/>
advice I can offer is to contact them <br/>
using the clue page and cross your fingers <br/>
if you feel the need to tell them of their <br/>
transgression. Funhog<br/>

Not to add fuel to the fire, but what does it concern the SC <br/>
legislature if boxes are on NPS land? These two in particular are, <br/>
however... If these are being used to push the bill through, though, <br/>
perhaps the legislators should go find them. They'd see that the boxes <br/>
are not placed in areas where they are doing any harm to the <br/>
historical area. In fact, if not for the boxes, we wouldn't have gone <br/>
to either place.<br/>
<br/>
The NPS manages to do quite well policing their own turf and SC <br/>
shouldn't have to help them. <br/>

Just to clarify, I also think the aforementioned boxes should be <br/>
removed since they are on NPS land. However, in the placers' defense <br/>
they may not have realized that National Military Parks are run by the <br/>
National Parks Service.<br/>

Am I the only one who is astonished, with all else<br/>
going on in the world, that South Carolina even gives<br/>
a hoot about letterboxing and geocaching.  Maybe they<br/>
should focus their collective energies on fixing<br/>
something, not ruining a rewarding and healthy hobby. <br/>
If that was even presented in RI they would laugh at<br/>
it and say something like  "Are you people freakin'<br/>
serious?  Forgetaboutit!!"  It does seem petty and<br/>
trivial in the greater scheme of things doesn't it? <br/>
Anyhow, Brenda, welcome to the group.  When I<br/>
responded to your post, I thought you were someone<br/>
else...really, no flames meant!!    You'll know what I<br/>
mean soon enough.  Good luck to you and try not to<br/>
quit your job.   Believe me you'll think of ways to<br/>
call in sick just so you can go for some boxes.  I<br/>
personally have never done that, but I've heard about<br/>
it...once...or is it twice now?<br/>

Yes! I agree...like the traffic! Around Mrytle Beach<br/>
during Easter break it was horrible. I can only<br/>
imagine what it is like during the peak summer weeks.<br/>
It's probably like the Baltimore and Washington, DC<br/>
beltways...parking lots.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If that was even presented in RI.<br/>
<br/>
Had a great time in RI a few summers ago...beautiful<br/>
state!!!<br/>

Well, what I meant was "a member of the letterboxing community who is <br/>
well liked and respected who might approach these owners..."<br/>
<br/>
That would be versus some schmoe who might be perceived as poking his <br/>
nose where it doesn't belong.<br/>
