<br/>
I stopped by the Magic Rabbit letterbox 10 days after Ryan stamped <br/>
up.  No one else had been by there.  <br/>
<br/>
I did enjoy reading the comments Ryan left in the log books in the <br/>
shelters and celebrated with him as he finished his first 20 mile day <br/>
shortly after Hot Springs. (I think it was in the Mountain Spring <br/>
shelter.)<br/>
<br/>
It was easy to spot the Green Turtle stamp in the logs.  <br/>
<br/>
I do remember well the spot just north of Sam's Gap where Ryan has <br/>
placed a letterbox...  Unfortunately, I happened by there on 19 May <br/>
and the clue was not posted until 21 May.  There was no way to get <br/>
the clue after 16 may anyway.  I was doing my Hot Springs to Erwin <br/>
section hike for 5 days.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if Ryan also hitched down to the diner at Sam's Gap?  It was <br/>
a great place to add some calories without carrying them on one's <br/>
back.  <br/>
<br/>
I did scan each of the trail registers to see if Green Turtle had <br/>
left any clues about boxes...  Oh well.  I only knew of the one box <br/>
at Tanners Gap left by Amanda.  I wish I would have known about the <br/>
High Rocks box as well.  I do have a pretty picture of the view from <br/>
there.<br/>
