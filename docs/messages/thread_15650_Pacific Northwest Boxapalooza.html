We've started the planning for the First Semiannual Pacific Northwest Boxapalooza event to be held (tentatively) at Rainbow Falls State Park near Chehalis, Wa. We're currently discussion over at the Pacific Northwest Letterboxing site at http://www.myndworx.com and here's a link to the topic:  http://www.myndworx.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=20 as well.<br/>
<br/>
We've got great plans for this event and are looking for all kinds of inputs from everyone... Come on over and join in the discussions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  The PNWLb Database as entered beta testing today. Take a look at it and leave me feedback on that as well.<br/>
