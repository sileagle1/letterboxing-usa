<br/>
Today, while out for a wonderful hike in a great park, we came upon a <br/>
very sad sight in a letterbox.  The box was a little exposed when we <br/>
found it but everything was intact, sort of...  The journal had been <br/>
vandalized in a pornographic way.  Some very obnoxious hoodlum had <br/>
taken it upon themself to leave very nasty images and notes with <br/>
websites and other references.  They had marred nearly seven or eight <br/>
pages throughout the logbook.  Being more than a little shocked, we <br/>
didn't quite know what to do.  Our first instinct was to remove the <br/>
pages because we wouldn't want our logbook to look like that.<br/>
<br/>
What should we have done?  Should we remove the offending pages<br/>
(possible in the logbook in question)?  Should we inform the placer <br/>
and let them deal with it?<br/>
<br/>

Informing the placer would be the best thing you could do. Mailing them the <br/>
log book and/or replacing it with a new one would be above and beyond but a <br/>
good too. I think it's great of you to be concerned. Thanks for caring!<br/>

Considering the large number of children that letterbox, I think your first instinct to remove the pages might be best.  You could still keep them, and focus on the good folks who truly enjoyed going to the box you offered them, despite bad efforts to detract from their stamps and kind words.

Yes, I would have removed the offending pages.  No reason a child out for a day of good, clean fun with his family should be subjected to this type of trash.  Just my humble opinion.  :)<br/>
