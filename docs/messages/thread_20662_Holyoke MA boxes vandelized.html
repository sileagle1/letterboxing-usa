Hi all! I'm never sure whether my "message to placer" e-mails get <br/>
through since I've sent half a dozen and never gotten a response. So <br/>
I thought I'd post here, in case anyone is planning on making a trip <br/>
to search for these boxes.  For the "Mountain Park" series, boxes <br/>
#1, #2, and #5 are all missing (as of 10/9/04). The stamp in box #4 <br/>
has been damaged. For the boxes planted in Ashley Reservoir (as of <br/>
10/10/04), "Horse-escape" was vandelized. I found the lid, the ink <br/>
pad, a horse sticker, and a plastic bag, but nothing else. "Golden <br/>
Faun" was also vandelized. I found all parts except the log book. I <br/>
put everything back together the best I could and rehid the box in <br/>
the same location. For the "Ladybuggy" box hidden in Chmura Park, <br/>
this box is missing (as of 10/10/04). It seems like a <br/>
disproportionatly large amount of Hoyoke boxes are damaged or <br/>
missing. Tough city!<br/>
<br/>
