of the vampire we call Mercy Brown<br/>
<br/>
She lies beneath the cold, hard ground<br/>
awaiting a boxer to move her around     <br/>
<br/>
(Are you scared yet?)You get to help me out by choosing your favorite <br/>
of the next two stanzas.<br/>
<br/>
Not from your neck will she want to drink<br/>
but the boxes she'll visit to slurp up the ink<br/>
(Boop, Katybug, Trish and I like that one)<br/>
<br/>
It's not your neck she'd like to seek<br/>
but the stamps of more boxes at which to peek<br/>
(That one,being more family friendly, is Ladybugs favorite)<br/>
<br/>
One knows not where she's next to hide<br/>
so be on your guard as she looks for a ride.<br/>
<br/>
This will be a unique set of boxes because there will be two, bearing <br/>
the same title, Mercy Brown, Exeter Vampire. They'll lie together, <br/>
awaiting the first boxer to take the hitchhiker for a ride.<br/>

Look for clues in a week or so, along with the list of credits for <br/>
this one.<br/>

Makes me want to get garlic breath and go on the huntdown in Rhode Island!<br/>
Maybe I should be thankful I don't live close  to these ominous creatures.<br/>
I get spooked easily.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for your kind words, Amanda. As I posted my two messages <br/>
yesterday morning, I figured if I were to take a beating, it would <br/>
have been from someone offended by a Vampire Letterbox. I actually <br/>
expected that. I came up with that idea from an interest  my daughter <br/>
had when she learned of the Legend. My intent was to only follow up <br/>
on her interest, and to make the journey fun for all the letterboxers <br/>
out there. Anyway, look for credits to come out in about a week. I <br/>
had a lot of help on this one. If you would like the stamp images, <br/>
being to far away to actually go out and get them E-mail me <br/>
(Hopkinsr1@aol.com) with your home address and I'll be more than <br/>
happy to send them to you. Once again, Thanks.<br/>
