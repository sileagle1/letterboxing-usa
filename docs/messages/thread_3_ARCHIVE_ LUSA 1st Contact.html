This is my first attempt to put together a list of ALL contacts<br/>
interested in letterboxing...<br/>
<br/>
...This list is somewhat different than what you are accustomed to if you<br/>
have been on talk lists before.  The intention is not for me to tell you<br/>
what to do or to provide you with a format.  All I ask is that you be <br/>
honest and share your ideas about letterboxing.  And when you need<br/>
something TELL ME WHAT TO DO.  I'm here to serve your needs in whatever<br/>
way I can in order to promote the hobby and make the best web pages and<br/>
communications possible.  The only drawback here is that I am but one<br/>
person.  I'm very deliberate and meticulous but I'm also very slow.  So<br/>
if you're looking for speed you're in the wrong place...<br/>
<br/>
...This list is not moderated.  Its for sharing Letterbox information and<br/>
for coming up with better ways to provide a FREE information service for<br/>
those who are interested in the hobby.  None of the information posted<br/>
here is meant to be owned or controlled by anyone.  I presume that as<br/>
long as you have a box out there you will want the clues to be freely<br/>
distributed.  Likewise if a box is no longer in service I presume you<br/>
will notify me so I can take down the clues.  <br/>
<br/>
Dan'l<br/>
<br/>
Ps. I discourage you from posting your clues here if you are also<br/>
posting them with a "Fee for clues" type of service.  That just really<br/>
rubs me the wrong way.  I'm sorry about that.  You know, I don't care if<br/>
we have 10,000 boxes listed. I just want all the clues to remain Free so<br/>
this will remain primarily a free-spirited, free-thinking, free-wheeling<br/>
fun-for-all that as many other people as possible can share in whether<br/>
they can afford it or not.  What kid do you know who can afford $35.00<br/>
for a clues book?<br/>

Well,Dan - <br/>
<br/>
	It is nice to see all the names in one place. There ae a few I've never<br/>
seen before.<br/>
	While I myself am not to the point of feeling it has to be an<br/>
"either/or" for clues and etc.,I see where you are coming from. As soon<br/>
as one starts costing money, I'll pull all my box info and keep it where<br/>
its free. I suspect others may as well. Its a personal choice, however. <br/>
For those still on the letterbox talk list who choose to reman in, I see<br/>
no conflict.<br/>
<br/>
	And, with that, for me the issue is closed. Thanks for putting this<br/>
together, Dan, and for your continued idealism.<br/>

I agree with Erik here.... the writer of the clue owns the copyright and has the right to give it to anyone they <br/>
want... if they don't mind that someone may profit from it one day, Dan'l shouldn't care either.  I personally <br/>
won't post clues on a site where someone can profit monetarily, but I won't judge others if they do. It really <br/>
doesn't matter. <br/>
<br/>
If Eric wants to run a business off this hobby one day, that's his right. I only had a problem with the fact that <br/>
we folks on his list were a captive audience to his advertisements if it did become a business. That's against <br/>
most TOS I believe.. to "harvest" names, so to speak, for monetary gain. He probably did it inadvertently. I <br/>
don't think he *meant* to profit from OUR work without our permission. I get the idea he loves web pages <br/>
more than he loves letterboxing. He needs to make a decision... letterboxing fun, or letterboxing business, <br/>
and then quit using his free list for advertising purposes. I'm sure I wouldn't be allowed to use that same list <br/>
for MY business ventures, nor you for yours, so he shouldn't be allowed either.<br/>
<br/>
I think most people don't care. Most people are happy to have Eric's "club" available, but the fact remains, <br/>
we don't need it. We have each other's names, and we will continue to march. <br/>
<br/>
Did anyone notice the post about the catalog of Dartmoor clues NOT being for profit? that about sums it up <br/>
for me.  It's not a business.<br/>
<br/>
Happy to be a part of this list. Hope to have news from Missouri to share soon re: an actual letterbox! <br/>
<br/>
Hope I made a little sense.........<br/>
Thank you all.<br/>
Lynn<br/>
PS I have compiled a list of my own based on posts to Eric's list. Soon as I find where I put it, I'll compare it <br/>
to this one and see if we've missed anyone :-)<br/>

I just want to thank Daniel Servatius for all the work he has put into <br/>
the Letterboxing USA page and for setting up this discussion group.  I <br/>
agree with Lynn of MO that Eric has the right to pursue a "for <br/>
profit" site/database.  But now, thanks to Daniel, those of us with a <br/>
vision of letterboxing as a "free" activity can pursue that, too.  And <br/>
if donations are needed to help keep this list and the Web site going, <br/>
please let us know.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, Lynn, when you get a box in place in Missouri, let me know.  <br/>
I have a sister living in Hartsburg and she and her son are interested <br/>
in letterboxing, but she has no Internet experience.  So when you post <br/>
your clue I'll print it out and mail it to them.  And then maybe they'll <br/>
hide a box!  Hope so, anyway.<br/>
