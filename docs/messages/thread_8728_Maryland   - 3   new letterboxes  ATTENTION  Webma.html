&gt;         STANLEY'S SURPRISE FOR HIS PRINCESS<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;      Centennial Park - North Area<br/>
&gt;      Off Old Annapolis Road, Columbia, Maryland<br/>
&gt;      Howard County<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  #1 Take Me To The Stars<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Stanley is a Red Eared Slider from Texas. He charmed his way into <br/>
&gt; Princess Turtles life exactly one year ago. Princess Turtle loves <br/>
&gt; carnivals and to show his appreciation, Stanley decided to take her <br/>
&gt; to the last one of the year.<br/>
&gt;   They went to Centennial Park. Starting from the tennis courts <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; headed back to the entrance. Following the path to the left and the <br/>
&gt; pine trees to the right. The two turtles went left at the fork in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; path. Stanley said they should arrive at the first ride shortly. <br/>
&gt; Princess Turtle needed to rest and chose the second bench on the <br/>
&gt; right. This was a perfect spot to wait in line for the ride. There <br/>
&gt; are 2 large pine trees to the right of the bench. Look at the base <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; the first pine tree of the 2 for #1.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   #2 Slightly Sweet, Slightly Salty<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Continue down the trail. A little way on the right is an unpaved <br/>
&gt; trail. The Princess was hungry and this was the way to the local <br/>
&gt; eatery. She didn't want the usual pond food. She had a strong <br/>
craving <br/>
&gt; for Kettle Corn. So they took a left at the pond and headed toward <br/>
&gt; the wooden bridge. Before the bridge the trail goes left. Look to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; left and beneath the large 2 in 1 tree that is where you will find <br/>
&gt; the Popcorn Stand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   #3 Two Tickets To Ride <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Stanley and the Princess headed back to the paved trail for one <br/>
&gt; more ride. They went right, passed the tennis courts on the left <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; crossed the concrete bridge. Up the winding road they went. They <br/>
ran <br/>
&gt; into Matthew Radik. Being the good scout hat he was, he showed them <br/>
&gt; the way to the carousel. He told them to stay left and at the <br/>
second <br/>
&gt; split, count 50 child size paces. You should see a faint path to <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; left that leads to a large 3 in 1 tree. There you will find The <br/>
&gt; Golden Carousel.<br/>
&gt;   If you continue down the path it will take you to the big lake. <br/>
&gt; Stanley and Princess Turtle were very tired from their day. So they <br/>
&gt; came home and had a slice of homemade apple cranberry pie that <br/>
&gt; Princess Turtle had made to celebrate their first anniversary.<br/>
&gt;   THE END<br/>
