Buncombe County, Asheville, NC<br/>
Placed by: Richard Babb (Seeker)<br/>
Equipment needed: Compass, one penny, stamp pad and a pen.<br/>
Difficulty: Easy walk<br/>
Clues: Medium, you will need to ask questions if you are not familiar <br/>
with Asheville. It is important to determine the correct starting point.<br/>
<br/>
Our story begins by the side of the river where old VANCE rests his <br/>
bones.Our hero will meet many on his quest, some will aid other will <br/>
distract. His first important encounter is with HOUSEWORTH although <br/>
HOUSEWORTH only points the way to PATTON. PATTON then helps us recall <br/>
JOHNSTON. But JOHNSTON is cursed and cannot speak. He nods in the <br/>
direction of Mr. BAIRD. But BAIRD is shy and mumbles. Our hero only <br/>
makes out the words "battle" and "three navy crosses." Looking around <br/>
our hero spots the crosses. He reach the spot and counts: 1,2,3 puts it <br/>
together and with compass in hand walks to Mr. WILLIAM PORTER. WILLLIAM <br/>
collects his toll (the penny), and whispers " Go see Tom. Go to the <br/>
North. Look for a man with "many virtues and few faults." And there <br/>
under the bottom step, a few words.<br/>

If you know WARREN WILSON you must seek him out. Because WARREN knows <br/>
BRYSON and BRYSON is the first character in our story. Quickly say hello <br/>
to Ms. St.Clair and Ms. Vining. You only have to nod at the phantom in <br/>
the stone toll booth. GLADFELTER will stop you and may even ask your <br/>
business. Keep quiet and go left.  Past the swing go right. HAMILL will <br/>
pose a question about your direction and the secret answer is "To the <br/>
left. To the STOP. Again left." And the story is now becoming familiar. <br/>
A setting in Mr. Orwell's tale. And standing with the CENTER to the left <br/>
the hard road ends and choices are to be made. To the right the road is <br/>
just a circle leading nowhere. To the left is barred by gate. The leaves <br/>
only the road leading to distant fields, and so you go. Along an easy <br/>
road  till it turns and you are drawn to the old red barn. You wander <br/>
past till you come to where the NATIVES dwell, and beside a lone small <br/>
cherry tree a footpath. Ahead of you are six POPLAR brothers. Some 160 <br/>
footfalls along this path, behind the sixth brother on your left is the <br/>
prize.<br/>
