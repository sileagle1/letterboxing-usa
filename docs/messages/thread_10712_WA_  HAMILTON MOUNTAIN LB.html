I know? I was in California), God smiled on us and has blessed us with<br/>
some beautiful, cool, sunny days recently.<br/>
<br/>
John and I headed out yesterday to see if we could land the Hamilton<br/>
Mountain Letterbox that Ryan placed last March.  The hike was<br/>
challenging (not quite as vertical as Rattlesnake Ledge, but a steep<br/>
uphill, nonetheless, most of the way), It's certainly well worth it for<br/>
the spectacular views you are rewarded with once you get up there and<br/>
the stamp when you find it.  Follow the more difficult trail to Hamilton<br/>
Mountain when there is another option.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to John for his bravery and fine compass skills, we were able to<br/>
find this box.  Admittedly, the risk level is a notch up on this one and<br/>
you'll want to read Ryan's statements about heights and sure-footedness<br/>
on his website regarding this letterbox.  Most of the hike is like any<br/>
other, but there are a few times you might wish to be morphed suddenly<br/>
into a mountain goat.  At one point exposure level is high, too, so be<br/>
well-dressed for wind.  <br/>
<br/>
This stamp is another real prize carved by Ryan Carpenter.  We were<br/>
absolutely SHOCKED to discover we were the first to stamp in.  What's up<br/>
with that?  A beautiful place and a wonderful letterbox!  I can't<br/>
believe Funhog hasn't been up here.  Be sure to do this one on a clear<br/>
day.  There is a great waterfall to be seen on the way up (please take<br/>
the short detour to the Pool of Winds on your way up or down.  It is<br/>
COOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow...that's my story and I'm sticking to it.  Go out and enjoy this<br/>
hike and hunt on a beautiful clear day the first chance you get.  You<br/>
will be glad you did!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

I second that motion!  =)  It has what I think are some of the best <br/>
views in all the gorge, and ALL views from the gorge are pretty <br/>
darned good!<br/>

<br/>
The Pool of Winds is REALLY cool, so I'd have to second that motion <br/>
as well.  =)  Especially on a hot, sweaty day!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed the box.  I was wondering when someone would get out <br/>
to see it.  I figured it was going to be those "maybe one or two <br/>
visitors a year--if it's lucky" kind of box because the trail is so <br/>
steep, but certainly worth the effort!  =)<br/>
