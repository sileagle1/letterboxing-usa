We live and hunt boxes in the north eastern united states.   I actually got into this by accident.  We were on a trip up to DeerField Ma and stopped at  a science center in Gill.  They were sponsoring a small "treasure" hunt for stamps on the grounds.  When we got home I checked out LBN and was hooked.  <br/>
