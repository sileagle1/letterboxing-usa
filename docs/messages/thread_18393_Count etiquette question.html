Of course you count it!! You didn't know it was there, right? You went to the <br/>
'trouble' of getting the box, right? You get the count!!<br/>

Could you tell us where you picked it up?<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure where I fall on this subject of counting it...<br/>
<br/>
...Did you count it as a Planted LB?  If not, then count it as Found, <br/>
I would think.<br/>

But then I like the reply from Doublesaj - that you didn't know it <br/>
was there.  <br/>
<br/>
Or create a new category "FM" (found mine!)<br/>

I don't think there is a LB auditor - so go with your conscience.<br/>
