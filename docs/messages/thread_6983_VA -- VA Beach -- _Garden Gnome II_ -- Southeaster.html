Amy has kindly allowed us to replace and adopt her two boxes in Redwing Park.  Both had been swiped so here's the first replacement...<br/>
<br/>
Garden Gnome II<br/>
(most of the cleverly written clues are hers--we've added a different ending to accommodate the new location).<br/>
<br/>
Redwing Park is located in Virginia Beach at 1398 General Booth Blvd., not far from the Oceanfront.  (These boxes are very near the "Flame of Hope" stamp on Oceana Blvd.)  Bring a lunch to enjoy in the picnic area after stamping in.  There's a nice small playground for the kids to burn off extra energy as well as a nice small playground for your pooch too.<br/>
<br/>
Park in the first parking lot to your left as you enter the park.  You may wish to enjoy the Japanese and Rose gardens before beginning your search.  Cross the road and enter the Redwing Gardens.  The Garden Gnome eagerly awaits your arrival.<br/>
<br/>
Start your search at the Redwing Gardens sign just inside the ivy garlanded white fence.  Before you lay four different paths.  Which one to take to visit with the Garden Gnome?  Take the 1st paved trail heading east.  Stay on this trail for a little while until two bridges come into sight.  Under one bridge once lived an evil<br/>
troll.  Some say the metal railings on this bridge acted as a lightening rod causing him to be hit many times over the years by these terrifying bolts.  This surely caused a bit of his insanity and outright meanness.  <br/>
<br/>
Our kindly Garden Gnome spends his time tending the gardens in Redwing Park...he used to live under the other bridge. The wooden construction of his home kept him safe from lightening storms but he had a tendency to sail away down the stream in his little Rubbermaid boat when it rained. So, after a particularly long journey toward the open ocean he decided to move.  To find his new home he thought he'd visit the evil troll under the other bridge and ask his neighborly advice regarding shelter....that's where things went wrong.  After waking the grumpy troll, quite a nasty brawl ensued...the evil troll fell into the water and has been rumored to have crawled aground and is hiding in the underbrush waiting to plot his revenge.  Maybe he'll have his very own box soon...but back to the story.  The kind Garden Gnome wants to prevent anyone from being lightening bolted into meanness again and now lives under the metal bridge.  He carries a lightening rod to protect all creatures great and small from harm in Redwing Park.  There you'll find him, under this bridge where he sleeps when he's not tending the gardens.  Make sure to whisper his name as you approach so that he doesn't think you're the evil troll,<br/>
<br/>
<i>Please do your best not to be seen retrieving this box as it has a habit of disappearing...and this can be a busy park.</i><br/>
