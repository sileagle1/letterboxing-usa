recommendations. I think that our next series will have log books in <br/>
each box. Many commented that sometimes they don't get to all the <br/>
boxes in a series. I would hate to miss any of the great signature <br/>
stamps just because someone couldn't make it to the entire series.<br/>
I have learnd so much from this group about our crazy obsession to <br/>
hunt tupperware in what ever environment it is hidden.<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
