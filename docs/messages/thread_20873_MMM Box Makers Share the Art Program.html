We are putting together a MMM Share the Art program. I have made scans of all the monster stamp images that were a part of the MMM. All scans will be available for viewing on my web site. The "Monster Makers List" will have a link going to the scanned image of each individual monster. If any of the box makers do not want their stamps image displayed, contact me and I will leave it off. If I hear nothing, it will be available for viewing. .....Chuck and Molly<br/>
