                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay so I figured out how to put the filters on my email so that all the announcements wouldn't go to my inbox, but I wasn't sure if it was right or not.  Just now I opened the box and there were 15 new messages in my in box, 7 in announcements and 71 in announcements for Virginia, so I thought, Oh No, I didn't do it right.  This must have been the day Wes chose to move the Virginia boxes over, because sure enough it DID work and there WERE 71 Virginia box announcements! Thanks for the idea!!V-Mama of the Triple V GangF19 HH2 P1 X2<br/>
