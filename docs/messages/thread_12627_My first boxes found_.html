about it and dreaming about it for months, but this winter was so ugly I wanted<br/>

<br/>
The first three I found at the Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens in Boothbay...<br/>
Flying Bird, Moon-on-the-River, and White Pine. It was a gorgeous day and a<br/>
great walk. I do this walk often anyway, because the trail it is on is where<br/>
mydaughter and other local kids build fairy houses. Found them without problems<br/>
and the ink on the stamps was still wet from people who'd found them the day before!<br/>
<br/>
On my way to Portland to pick my daughter, Misha (a soon-to-be letterboxer) at<br/>
the bus station I took a detour in Brunswick and found the Rings of Heaven. What<br/>
a nice walk! I'd never gone over the pedestrian bridge before and it was great.<br/>
The box was very damp inside, and the stamp was cracked but not broken yet. I<br/>
tried to dry things off a bit.<br/>
<br/>
So that was my first day. I got such a thrill. Now Misha is designing her own<br/>
stamp for me to carve and we'll do more this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Yay...<br/>
