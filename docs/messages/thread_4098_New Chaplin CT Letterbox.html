<p>Location: Chaplin, CT Windham County</p>
<p>Rated: Moderate</p>
<p>This trip down marked trails takes you to a lesser known lake in the Goodwin 
Forest.</p>
<p>Total round trip will be about 1 hour.Most people think of the Goodwin Forest 
as being in Hampton. This letterbox and most of the route is just over the town 
line and is in Chaplin. A nice wildlife walk. </p>
<p>Going from North Windham head east on route 6. Take a left onto Potter Road. 
This is the entrance to Goodwin State Forest in Hampton CT. There you will see a 
wooden sign stating this and a sign which states Pine Acres Lake. There is also 
a boat ramp sign. Follow this road a short distance to 11<sup>th</sup> section 
Rd which is a right hand turn. Travel down 11<sup>th</sup> section Rd 1.3 miles 
where the road turns sharply and there is a sign that says Esterbrook Rd. Bear 
left here onto unmarked road which is actually Nutmeg Lane. Travel 3 tenths of a 
mile. You will see several paths that cross the road here and a white marked 
trail on the left and right of the road. There is also room to park a few cars 
here on the right side of the road. Park here. The rest is by foot. To the 
letterbox it is about a 15 to 20 minute walk. Cross the road and take the white 
blazed trail. Follow the white blazed trees and ignore any trails that go to the 
left. The white trail is rocky and wet in spots and turns from a narrow trail to 
the width of a road. Depending on the season you can view the lake most of the 
time on the right. The white trail ends at a T. Travel right following the blue 
blazed trail ( Natchaug Trail) to the lake and a man made earthen dam. Looking 
over the lake you get a great view. You can see that there is only one exit pipe 
for the water to leave the lake making a small stream on the other side of the 
earthworks. You must get down to that stream. Once there you will see a pile of 
large rocks. Three of which form a tripod which holds a man made board that 
measures about 24 inches long, 7 inches wide and 2 inches thick. Your goal is in 
the crevace of the rocks under the board. These rocks are about 28 steps 
downstream from the opening of the pipe on the rear side of the dam. Looking 
from the dam it is on the left side of the stream. You can backtrack to get back 
to you car or take a scenic route which will complete your circle around the 
lake. This route back took me 25 minutes for the letterbox. Continue on past the 
dam on the blue trail. Follow the blue blazed trail until the trail comes to a 
T. Take a right here following the blue trail down a path the width of a road. 
You will shortly come to an intersection. Go right off the blue trail and follow 
that old road back to your car. This would be a great trip to coincide with the 
Forgotten Wood Pile walk. Both start at the same point.</p></div></body></html>
