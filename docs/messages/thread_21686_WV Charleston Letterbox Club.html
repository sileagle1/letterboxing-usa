Hi!  My wife and I are new to letterboxing and we are trying to form a <br/>
club in Charleston WV to meet up with local letterboxers.  We'd like to <br/>
do things such as day excursions where we all go out to a location and <br/>
hunt for boxes, have a picnic, plant boxes as a group, have events at a <br/>
local mall in partnership with a bookstore to help raise awareness of <br/>
letterboxing, etc.  To read more about the group, please visit:<br/>
<br/>
http://letterboxing.meetup.com/32/<br/>
<br/>
You can also RSVP through this site.<br/>
<br/>
We also go out to Marlinton, WV monthly during the summer and wouldn't <br/>
mind trying to set up a group there too.  We noticed that there are <br/>
several boxes located in Hillsboro, Elkins, Davis and Spruce Knob that <br/>
are all near to Marlinton.<br/>
<br/>
We are interested to hear from any locals!<br/>
<br/>
