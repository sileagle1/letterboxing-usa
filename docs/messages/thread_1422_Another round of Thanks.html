Letterbox and recovering it. I should have covered it with a rock but I was <br/>
new at this at the time and who knew leaves would blow away. It is nice that <br/>
we take care of each others boxes. I have been thinking of taking extra <br/>
baggies and a box incase a box needs repairing when I find it. The 1st York <br/>
River letterbox is  missing. No one has ever found it. I guess you didn't get <br/>
the word. I'm glad you didn't spend time looking for it. <br/>

</p><p>Great idea, Squirrel! I've thought about it too, and will now add those
baggies and extra boxes when I go a-huntin'. BTW what happens to letterbox
log books when they fill up?

Space, I know of one book that has filled up, and therefore may <br/>
qualify as the "most visited" letterbox in North America. It's called <br/>
Elaine and Jerry's Rocks and is on the Connecticut map. The owners <br/>
(the Disch Family?) replaced the log book and moved the old one to <br/>
our local EMS store where you can see it and check out probably 100 <br/>
different personal stamps.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't had any of our own logbooks fill up yet, but think when <br/>
they do we may save them as a keepsake.<br/>
