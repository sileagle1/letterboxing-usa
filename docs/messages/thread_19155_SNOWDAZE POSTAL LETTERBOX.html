<br/>
It has now been more than 6 months since the Snowdaze Postal <br/>
Letterbox was sent to the first recipient. Hopefully, it has worked <br/>
its way steadily across the United States and is at least halfway <br/>
towards its final destination. However, I have not received word on <br/>
its condition since the end of March. If you received it after that, <br/>
PLEASE send me an e-mail! I am trying to track its progress and <br/>
cannot do that without y'all's help. I was considering a "Snowdaze <br/>
II" Postal Letterbox this winter, but if I do not get the original <br/>
back, I am highly disinclined to do so. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you, and keep in touch!<br/>
<br/>
