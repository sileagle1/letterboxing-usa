One of the things that my sons and I were struck with this last summer <br/>
in Yellowstone is that the Park Rangers really do not like it when we <br/>
leave anything in the park. Letterboxing in National Parks they say <br/>
leads to the destruction of the natural environment and flies in the <br/>
face of 'Leave No Trace Principals' they support.<br/>
<br/>
What they did enjoy doing with us were 'virtual letterboxes' - where <br/>
you find the clues and they lead you to a website to get your stamp <br/>
and leave a message. <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>
