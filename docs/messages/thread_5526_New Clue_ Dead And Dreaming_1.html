Greetings to you, oh seeker of sounds,<br/>
Your curious mind has summoned you hither,<br/>
Bring not only your stamp, your pad, and your book,<br/>
But please, dont forget your CD player,<br/>
For inside of this box with letters of cheer,<br/>
Is a circle of sound that you may soon hear.<br/>
<br/>
The band, Dead and Dreaming, are weavers of songs,<br/>
That speak to us truly as others may not,<br/>
They are six fine young men on a journey of love,<br/>
And their genre of music is often called Rock,<br/>
But please dont expect music shallow or flaunting,<br/>
For their style it is subtle, and complex, and haunting.<br/>
<br/>
What better scene than the graves of the dead,<br/>
For the name of this band summons thoughts to the mind,<br/>
Of  lonely green fields, where ancestors lie,<br/>
After leaving this life for another world fine,<br/>
Though the music you hear speaks little of dying,<br/>
It sings of the dreams that keep our souls flying.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps before leaving to seek ye the prize,<br/>
Of a concert so fine in the woodland so fair,<br/>
You may wish to visit deadanddreaming.net,<br/>
Where youll learn of the music that you will hear there,<br/>
For though they all hail from our own Nutmeg State,<br/>
The fame of their music is not yet so great.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is time to proceed on your way,<br/>
You may travel by car for the trip may be long,<br/>
It is best to arrive in the sun of the day,<br/>
Or if night seems to beckon, bring a torchlight strong,<br/>
Rte 2 to Colchester, exit eighteen is best<br/>
Take a turn at the end on to Rte 16West.<br/>
<br/>
About a mile down a hill and then again up,<br/>
You will turn now a left on to Buckeley Hill Rd.<br/>
This is the way that the French soldiers marched,<br/>
When they traveled this trail in the hard days of old.<br/>
You will come to a stop sign in three miles or so,<br/>
Please do not turn, straight on you should go.<br/>
<br/>
For a mile past the stop sign, on your way through the woods,<br/>
You will be on the OConnell Rd Extension,<br/>
The road it will come on a wall made of stones,<br/>
That were piled in the days of our brave Revolution,<br/>
Dont take the fork, but the gate is on high,<br/>
Into Ackley Cemetery, where the peaceful dead lie.<br/>
<br/>
Now it is time to listen with care,<br/>
For the clues I will give you are clear and are great<br/>
Youll move over the yard and along to the left,<br/>
Where most of the stones will be standing up straight.<br/>
Look for five in a row, with tops somewhat round,<br/>
That have oval carved faces looking over the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Standing in front of these relics of lives,<br/>
You will notice the middle one stands out so clear,<br/>
It tells of fair Lucy, a dutiful wife,<br/>
Who tragically died in her 54th year,<br/>
Was this her soft face, with small pursed lips?<br/>
That is watching us now with heavenly bliss?<br/>
<br/>
It is now time to turn directly around,<br/>
And looking across toward the faraway wall,<br/>
You will see smaller stones peeking out of the earth,<br/>
And youll look for the pointiest one of them all,<br/>
