to me with ideas, suggestions, and support about my cats and my husbands<br/>
asthma.<br/>
<br/>
We have tried many of your suggestions... the ones working so far are:<br/>
Acepromaxzine - this is a tranquilzer that is diluted 30 times and is<br/>
proven to change the ph of the cats saliva.<br/>
Brushing - we are brushing 1-2 times daily and have them down to almost<br/>
no shedding<br/>
Baths - oh yea, the cat LOVES this one!  HA  Anyway - once a week he<br/>
gets a bath w/ an anti-dander shampoo... this is helping, but he still<br/>
needs work<br/>
Bath wipes - mid-week he gets wiped down with a wipe that helps w/<br/>
dander and shedding.<br/>
Shed-Free tablets - crumbled on food, they are supposed to help reduce<br/>
shedding<br/>
Hairball Food - this may take a while, but this combined w. the brushing<br/>
is working - not a hairball in a week!<br/>
<br/>
So... with all of this - Michael has decided that Stormy can stay (he<br/>
isn't real thrilled, but agreed to it).  This will be on a trial<br/>
basis... if they are still unable to live together, we will have to come<br/>
up with a new solution.  BUt, at least I get to try!  =]  <br/>
<br/>
Cow and Bonkers will be leaving on Saturday to go home with my mom.  It<br/>
is hard to let them go, but I know they will be happier.  Bonkers is 16<br/>
and she really doesn't care for the babies in the house.. and Cow loves<br/>
my mom.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thank you all!  I really really apprecited all of your emails!<br/>
