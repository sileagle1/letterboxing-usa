Wildlife Drive, I am afraid you will be disappointed. The majority of <br/>
the Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge (one of my favorite places) is not <br/>
accessible to the public at this time. Shortly after the terrorist <br/>
attacks it was closed to the public due to it being immediately <br/>
adjacent to the Kennedy Space Center and military satellite launch <br/>
facilities. There is no information when it will open again, but I <br/>
don't think it will be any time soon. An update to this effect on the <br/>
LbNA site might be a good idea since this may last a while. I <br/>
probably should have posted this a couple weeks ago but I hadn't even <br/>
thought about this in the context of everything else that has <br/>
happened in our country. The Canaveral Marshes box nearby is still <br/>
accessible and intact as far as I know.<br/>
