&gt;  Um, I may have missed something (I haven't been able to read all<br/>
&gt;  my mail lately) so please remind me what we're doing here, ok?<br/>
<br/>
Julie, I think we are doing a few things.  Mitch is almost through<br/>
with the masthead at the top of the home page, which he did very<br/>
nicely I might add.  I think it is going to get streamlined a bit<br/>
and perhaps reduced in size to load faster.  Michelle Spalding<br/>
("Hoofbeads" - Colorado) did some exceptional work on a logo.  I <br/>
think you were in on that.  If not, look at <br/>
http://www.gigagraphica.com/michelle/logosamp.html<br/>
and feel free to comment.  I think that's sort of on hold, and I think<br/>
the logo will be part of the masthead design.<br/>
Additionally, Randy Hall has completed an FAQ (very professionally<br/>
done) which can be seen at<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq.html<br/>
You can also link to it from the "About &amp; FAQ's" option on the<br/>
Letterboxing USA main page.  Randy has also added a couple of clues<br/>
to the site using a new format, the "Mapsurfer" clue.  See<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/oh.htm  <br/>
for an example.  I think in the future the "?" may appear in a<br/>
separate area below the state map to avoid the implication that<br/>
you are clicking on a location by using the map.  <br/>
I think Ohio, Virginia, Arkansas and California are the most<br/>
recent additions.  Well, that should bring you up to speed.<br/>
We're also constantly looking for new containers, esp. water<br/>
tight ones and are also looking for ways to get started that<br/>
are cheap and easy but also that do not leave out creativity<br/>
or artistic elements.  Included in the quest for new materials<br/>
are water-proof log books that will accept water-based inks<br/>
without inordinate smearing and perhaps stamps made from<br/>
drawings that are affordable, maybe even reusable.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you (and others).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The best way to handle this, IMO, is to allow the artist to decide<br/>
how this will be done and where the ? will be placed.  This may not <br/>
be feasable now, except by hand, but it should be someday.  In <br/>
this instance, a ? captioned "Ohio" in the middle of the state <br/>
should not confuse anyone, especially if a clear legend is <br/>
available.  This power would be especially useful if, for example,<br/>
you placed a box in Northeastern Ohio, or in a particular county<br/>
in Ohio.  Placing the ? physically in the Northeastern part of <br/>
the state does provide information for the prospective hunter.<br/>
My Eastern Shore, MD clue is like that; physically placing on<br/>
the Eastern Shore of MD (which is more accessable from Delaware<br/>
and where Der Wolf lives ;-) than from most of Maryland) provides<br/>
much more value than a general Maryland link below the state<br/>
will.  I will handle these on the web site, as Dan has suggested.<br/>
<br/>
The legend, which is probably someone else's idea, would be something<br/>
like:<br/>
<br/>
Red Dot - exact location<br/>
Blue Dot - location of start<br/>
Green Dot - approx location<br/>
? - vague or non-determinate location, with caption.<br/>
<br/>
The key on the ? is the caption.  It should not be confusing.<br/>
BTW, the above is for example purposes only, you get the idea.<br/>

I agree with this.  I think it was someone else who expressed the<br/>
concern that (a great number) of "?" on the map would be confusing.<br/>
But in view of the legend idea I think its as workable as the dots.<br/>
Also, I did not know where in Ohio to put the symbol.  It was just<br/>
a guess (and apparently a lucky one) to put it in the middle<br/>
of the state.<br/>

Dan'l &amp; Randy, I can't tell you how glad I am to see you guys reach an agreement on this:o))<br/>
<br/>
Now, I want to put some pressure on myself (and maybe others too).  Seems to be how I function best.  I've been thinking about (i.e. not really DOING anything about) planting my next box.  Would be the 1st in DE if Randy has any patience left.  Here comes the pressure part...  I'll have it hidden by 5/3.  You heard me.  Now, I have to just go out and do it...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of you boxers out there would like to add another state or two to the map?  Or maybe another set of clues or two to exsisting states?<br/>
<br/>
I encourage each and everyone of you to get on my case about my self-imposed deadline!!!!<br/>

JDW - <br/>
I agree - a challange is a great des.<br/>
How about, who can add the most letterboxes by, say, June 1?<br/>
Or, who can add the most new states,by that date?<br/>
<br/>
I agree that its fun to stay on top of things via this egrope, and a LOT<br/>
of great work has been done with the web page permutations. Thanks to<br/>
all those who have made it so.<br/>
<br/>
However, it should be warm enough throughout the country (except, I<br/>
guess) Alaska (Bob and Mary Ellen - are you still there?). Time to carve<br/>
a few stamps, put out a few more boxes, get the clues to Dan'l, and<br/>
congratulate yourself. Carpe Diem!<br/>
