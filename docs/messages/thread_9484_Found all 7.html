YIPPIE ! :)  I was the 1st one to sign in.  All 7 boxes are still <br/>
secure.  <br/>
<br/>
We went camping this weekend in the pines (Brrrr) and found all 7 of <br/>
your letterboxes.  What a neat style (tangram) to do your letterbox <br/>
in.  I have never seen it done that way before.  Very creative stamp <br/>
also.  <br/>
<br/>
I have lived in S.Jersey all my life (30+) and have never seen or ever <br/>
heard anything about this place.  I have just recently become very <br/>
interested in both letterboxing and the history of the pines and hope <br/>
to combine the 2 somehow.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, you asked for an update and here it is.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Good Letterboxing to you!<br/>
