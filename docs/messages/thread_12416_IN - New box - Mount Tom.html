Mount Tom Letterbox<br/>
Near Chesterton, Indiana, Porter county<br/>
<br/>
Placed 4/27/03 on a letterboxing foray into Indiana by Matt the Rat &amp;<br/>
Jeni B<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
You might think its only a hill of beans.<br/>
But around here we make mountains out of these!<br/>
<br/>
Mount Tom is the tallest peak in the area, with a great view of the<br/>
forests to the south from its summit.<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the mountain, look for a horizontal log. Behind this is<br/>
a tree with a hole at its base. Be sure to completely cover the box<br/>
with pieces of bark and hide it well when you leave.<br/>
