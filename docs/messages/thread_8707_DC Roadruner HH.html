it muddy!) and found all four boxes and the DC Roadrunner HH.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what has happened to this HH so far:<br/>
<br/>
Launched at the Bee's Knees box on 10/6/02 by Waterbird.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know who found it or when but sometime later it was moved to <br/>
the Who Cooks for You? box.<br/>
<br/>
We found it on Oct 26.<br/>
<br/>
What will happen to it next?  Start looking, Virginia.<br/>
