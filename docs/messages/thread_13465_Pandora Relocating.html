<br/>
I just thought I would drop a little note to the list to thank everyone for<br/>
their well wishes on my food getting better.  Hopefully it will heal well<br/>
and soon and I appreciate your care and healing thoughts.  Next I wanted to<br/>
say that you all probably won't hear from me for awhile.  As of a few days<br/>
ago I decided to relocate to Portland even earlier.  I missed Iron`Bear too<br/>
much and well California was just starting to get old. So off I go.. I will<br/>
be leaving California a week from today most likely (Should all go well) and<br/>
will drop you all a note saying hi when I arrive in Portland and get my<br/>
Internet and all set up.<br/>
<br/>
Wish me luck, doing it with a broken foot is not that easy!<br/>
But hey those Portland letterboxs are keeping me inspired!! There sure are<br/>
alot out there!<br/>

The Jones Point Lighthouse microbox was in what I believe was an M&amp;Ms<br/>
tube. The zip lock bags were quite wet inside and out but the tube<br/>
and scrool log were dry inside.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think this is enough messages yet from me about this box? :-)<br/>

Subject: My first stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I just did my first THREE stamps today! I am so excited. They<br/>
turned out so nicely. I only wish I had a scanner or something so I<br/>
could share them!<br/>
I started with a really simple design for my first one. It turned<br/>
out SO nicely I decided to go ahead try and do my personal stamp. I<br/>
did that- it admittedly took two tries. And then I did another for<br/>
my husband!<br/>
Thanks to Mary from VA for your tips on getting the right tools (I<br/>
used a Micheal's coupon just as you did!). And also, if the person<br/>
who did the website Carving 101 is on this list-- thanks to you as<br/>
well! (That website was also VERY useful and helpful!)<br/>
Here is the link in case anyone else needs some tips for their first<br/>
stamp: (It seems like mostly experienced letterboxers here--but just<br/>
in case someone new runs across this)<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Docs/Carving/<br/>
Now I am ready to find my first box!!!<br/>

  No prize, just a stamp and a great " hidden from the general public"<br/>
location. If so, then "hidden pond" will be placed at the geocaching<br/>
site. Thanks for the info.<br/>

&gt; The most common you'll see are PF and X.<br/>

&gt; E is typically an event stamp (which you would get from attending a<br/>

OK I know that I am probably over doing this but I want to share this<br/>
great "hidden place" with you all, geocachers &amp; letterboxers. For sure<br/>
there are numerous other great places in this vast land we tread but this<br/>
is place is one of our favorites , though very hard to find : HIDDEN<br/>
POND - Be careful, there are all kinds of obstacles along the way! A<br/>
rough 3 miles. (slippery rocks, posion ivy,snakes,splits in the path are<br/>
some of them) Four specific points along the way are marked<br/>
(waypoints)<br/>
<br/>
          The new search capability of the new letterbox site make it<br/>
easy to find the place which has the clues.<br/>
          ( only a letterbox to be found there - with a pad, stamp<br/>
(Spider) and pen )<br/>
<br/>
         Thanks Wes and to all the other people not mentioned that made<br/>
this hobby so much better.<br/>

While letterboxing in Branford, CT today we found boxes 1 and 3 of<br/>
the Trail of Terror (NOT!) but could not get to box #2. We visited<br/>
the Golden Thread and found the stamp intact but the log book<br/>
totally water logged. We searched for, but did not find Who Let the<br/>

<br/>
Here's a heads up on a new WI series that should be posted soon. For those<br/>
who like to plan ahead, and are in the Milwaukee/Chicago area (or will be<br/>
this summer) we thought we'd let you know about it.<br/>
<br/>
We will be "hiding" a series of 7 or 8 stamps (letterboxes) with some of the<br/>
individuals working the Bristol Ren Faire (starts June 28 and runs through<br/>
mid-August on Saturdays and Sundays). Using the clues we will give you, you<br/>
will have to find the individuals and give the code words or perform some<br/>
other activity to get the stamp from them. It should be a lot of fun!<br/>
<br/>
Look for a posting of the clues and other information soon!<br/>

<br/>
Hi Boxers;<br/>
<br/>
      Sue and I just got back late this afternoon from our VT vacation<br/>
and even had time to do some letterboxing in NH.<br/>
<br/>
      These are the following boxes we found, all in great shape:<br/>
<br/>
Honey Hill Letterboxes, Swanzey, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Franklin Pearce Letterbox, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Fuller Public Library, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Fox Forest, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Deering Overlook, Deering, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Deering Public Library, Deering, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Lovely Weed, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
Man in Stone, Dorset, VT 6/04/03<br/>
<br/>
      The mosquitos and no-see-ums were wild with all of the rain the<br/>
first weekend of our vacation - felt like we were in the Florida Keys<br/>
or the Everglades with all of the insects!!<br/>
<br/>
      RTRW: Great stamps and nice locations for the above boxes that<br/>
are yours - almost missed the Deering Library! And the bugs prevented<br/>
us from finding your Town Pound box - we searched for about 15<br/>
minutes and had to leave. We will try this again in the fall! Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
      I will add some commentary tomorrow night to our website, as<br/>
well as a few new CT Gerbil Photos and some personal boxing pictures<br/>
that came in the mail while we were away.<br/>
<br/>
      Thanks,<br/>

Found two new letterboxes in LA County, planted by Chowder.<br/>
Incredible stamps and the Marina Pacifica Plumbing Problem hiding<br/>
spot is genius! Naples Canal Conundrum stamp also very, very nice!<br/>
Gwen &amp; Don's signal hill in good shape, what a view!<br/>
We went to our new plants Strange Stamps series and the second box<br/>
was out of it's hiding spot and thrown all over the ground. We<br/>
retrived the stamp and log book and have taken it in for repairs.<br/>
Hope to get it back in place before next weekend. The tree it was<br/>
hidden in might be a popular place for kids to play so we may move<br/>
the spot. The other two boxes are alive and well.<br/>
Our Lizards Crossing in Whittier, the first box you need to find the<br/>
1 mile marker to get to the box, some one has removed the one mile<br/>
marker. We will re-work the clues, second and third boxes are fine.<br/>
It seems the second box has been missed by alot of people, we are<br/>
going to re-work the clues. For those of you who have found it our<br/>
hats are off to you.<br/>
Box on,<br/>

Hi Tracy &amp; welcome!<br/>
<br/>
Out here, we usually don't include a stamp pad in our boxes, like they do in<br/>
the east. We all carry our own stamp pads (sometimes several--also sometimes<br/>
colored, water-based markers) and choose our own colors.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan (who's currently hiking the Appalachian Trail) carved that swell stamp<br/>
at Haceta Head. Before he took off, he set up a regional list-serve for the<br/>
PNW--check us out at LbPNW@yahoogroups.com<br/>
<br/>
We've got a gathering coming up at Milo McIver Park in Oregon on July 12-13.<br/>
You're very welcome to join us--many of us regional folks will be meeting<br/>
each other for the first time. (You can check out the regional talk-list<br/>
archive<br/>
for more info about the gathering, or just stay tuned--there's sure to be<br/>
more buzz as that weekend approaches.)<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

The only thing to be careful of would be placing it too close to the<br/>
geocache site. If a geocacher finds it, they might take the stamp and leave<br/>
you with something else.<br/>

   budster was wondering if a letterbox is good enough for a geocache site?<br/>
   No prize, just a stamp and a great " hidden from the general public"<br/>
   location. If so, then "hidden pond" will be placed at the geocaching<br/>
   site. Thanks for the info.<br/>

<br/>
I got so excited about this post that I went out on a spur of the moment<br/>
drive and found it (and now I'm getting back in the middle of the night).<br/>
<br/>
ZenRoxie, this was just a beautiful box!! I am so glad that someone took<br/>
the time to mark this spot, and the stamp is my favorite so far-wonderful.<br/>
I was honored to stamp in to this LB. Thank you for thinking of such a<br/>
great spot. It's a shame that this part of U.S. history seems to have been<br/>
forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
I won't say more so I don't spoil a "mystery" for others. Thanks for the<br/>
extras in the box. That added to the moment. Anyone out here should go<br/>
find this spot.<br/>
<br/>
Cadenza<br/>
<br/>
ps. ZenRoxie, While I was out that direction, I went ahead and found that<br/>
other box we discussed. Fun park. Keep planting so I have more reasons to<br/>
visit.<br/>

I use a Garmin E-Trex Legend. It has pretty good accuracy in most conditions<br/>
 usually around 15'-30'. It also has a mapping function that shows a<br/>
topographic view of the terrain in the area.<br/>

     Just Curious, Which type of GPS do you like? What kind do you use in<br/>
your<br/>
     tracking? Do you think LB clues and geocaching go together?<br/>
              Carrying around a GPS is kind of like having a camera when<br/>
     others that are around don't know what you are up to. Kind of makes you<br/>
     look like you are "on a mission" and everything is ok. What do you<br/>
     think?<br/>

&gt; Well, I just did my first THREE stamps today! I am so excited. They<br/>
&gt; turned out so nicely. I only wish I had a scanner or something so I<br/>
&gt; could share them!<br/>
&gt; I started with a really simple design for my first one. It turned<br/>
&gt; out SO nicely I decided to go ahead try and do my personal stamp. I<br/>
&gt; did that- it admittedly took two tries. And then I did another for<br/>
&gt; my husband!<br/>
&gt; Thanks to Mary from VA for your tips on getting the right tools (I<br/>
&gt; used a Micheal's coupon just as you did!). And also, if the person<br/>
&gt; who did the website Carving 101 is on this list-- thanks to you as<br/>
&gt; well! (That website was also VERY useful and helpful!)<br/>
&gt; Here is the link in case anyone else needs some tips for their <br/>
first<br/>
&gt; stamp: (It seems like mostly experienced letterboxers here--but <br/>
just<br/>
&gt; in case someone new runs across this)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;person who placed this box on the list? Has anyone on the list <br/>
found<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;box? We went back twice to seach, we just hated to give up on <br/>
our first<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;letterbox!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wasn't able to find that box last fall -- I do believe it's <br/>
missing.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wel, first - Welcome MOMOF3!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The most common you'll see are PF and X.<br/>
&gt; &gt; P is for boxes planted.<br/>
&gt; &gt; F is for boxes found, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; X is for stamps exchanged with other letterboxers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; From there it gets a bit more ... wild.<br/>
&gt; &gt; E is typically an event stamp (which you would get from <br/>
attending a<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing event in which a special stamp has been created)<br/>
&gt; &gt; HH is a hitchhiker (though some count these in the F instead)<br/>
&gt; &gt; V is virtual (these are boxes found online)<br/>
&gt; &gt; T is probably a traveler (some boxers carry travelers around and<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to discover these by accident - sort of)<br/>
&gt; &gt; A is ... well ... I have no clue what A is, but it meant <br/>
something<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the person who counted it! :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You'll also sometimes see ...<br/>
&gt; &gt; C for "confiscated by the National Park dudes" and<br/>
&gt; &gt; R for "rescued/repaired boxes" - or maybe for Reptiles seen on <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trail?... and even<br/>
&gt; &gt; L for Lizards! Heck, one lucky lady even has a<br/>
&gt; &gt; PP for a proposal via letterbox!<br/>

&gt; &gt; There are no rules!<br/>

&gt; OK I know that I am probably over doing this but I want to share <br/>
this<br/>
&gt; great "hidden place" with you all, geocachers &amp; letterboxers. For <br/>
sure<br/>
&gt; there are numerous other great places in this vast land we tread <br/>
but this<br/>
&gt; is place is one of our favorites , though very hard to find : <br/>
HIDDEN<br/>
&gt; POND - Be careful, there are all kinds of obstacles along the way! <br/>
A<br/>
&gt; rough 3 miles. (slippery rocks, posion ivy,snakes,splits in the <br/>
path are<br/>
&gt; some of them) Four specific points along the way are marked<br/>
&gt; (waypoints)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;           The new search capability of the new letterbox site make <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; easy to find the place which has the clues.<br/>
&gt;           ( only a letterbox to be found there - with a pad, stamp<br/>
&gt; (Spider) and pen )<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;          Thanks Wes and to all the other people not mentioned that <br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Here's a heads up on a new WI series that should be posted soon. <br/>
For those<br/>
&gt; who like to plan ahead, and are in the Milwaukee/Chicago area (or <br/>
will be<br/>
&gt; this summer) we thought we'd let you know about it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We will be "hiding" a series of 7 or 8 stamps (letterboxes) with <br/>
some of the<br/>
&gt; individuals working the Bristol Ren Faire (starts June 28 and runs <br/>
through<br/>
&gt; mid-August on Saturdays and Sundays). Using the clues we will give <br/>
you, you<br/>
&gt; will have to find the individuals and give the code words or <br/>
perform some<br/>
&gt; other activity to get the stamp from them. It should be a lot of <br/>
fun!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Look for a posting of the clues and other information soon!<br/>

&gt; Hi Boxers;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;       Sue and I just got back late this afternoon from our VT <br/>
vacation<br/>
&gt; and even had time to do some letterboxing in NH.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;       These are the following boxes we found, all in great shape:<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Honey Hill Letterboxes, Swanzey, NH 6/02/03<br/>
&gt; Franklin Pearce Letterbox, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
&gt; Fuller Public Library, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
&gt; Fox Forest, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
&gt; Deering Overlook, Deering, NH 6/02/03<br/>
&gt; Deering Public Library, Deering, NH 6/02/03<br/>
&gt; Lovely Weed, Hillsborough, NH 6/02/03<br/>
&gt; Man in Stone, Dorset, VT 6/04/03<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;       The mosquitos and no-see-ums were wild with all of the rain <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; first weekend of our vacation - felt like we were in the Florida <br/>
Keys<br/>
&gt; or the Everglades with all of the insects!!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;       RTRW: Great stamps and nice locations for the above boxes <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; are yours - almost missed the Deering Library! And the bugs <br/>
prevented<br/>
&gt; us from finding your Town Pound box - we searched for about 15<br/>
&gt; minutes and had to leave. We will try this again in the fall! <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;       I will add some commentary tomorrow night to our website, as<br/>
&gt; well as a few new CT Gerbil Photos and some personal boxing <br/>
pictures<br/>
&gt; that came in the mail while we were away.<br/>

&gt; Gwen &amp; Don's signal hill in good shape, what a view!<br/>
&gt; We went to our new plants Strange Stamps series and the second box<br/>
&gt; was out of it's hiding spot and thrown all over the ground. We<br/>
&gt; retrived the stamp and log book and have taken it in for repairs.<br/>
&gt; Hope to get it back in place before next weekend. The tree it was<br/>
&gt; hidden in might be a popular place for kids to play so we may move<br/>
&gt; the spot. The other two boxes are alive and well.<br/>
&gt; Our Lizards Crossing in Whittier, the first box you need to find <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; 1 mile marker to get to the box, some one has removed the one mile<br/>
&gt; marker. We will re-work the clues, second and third boxes are fine.<br/>
&gt; It seems the second box has been missed by alot of people, we are<br/>
&gt; going to re-work the clues. For those of you who have found it our<br/>

&gt; The only thing to be careful of would be placing it too close to <br/>
the<br/>

and leave<br/>
&gt; you with something else.<br/>

&gt; I got so excited about this post that I went out on a spur of the <br/>
moment<br/>
&gt; drive and found it (and now I'm getting back in the middle of the <br/>
night).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; ZenRoxie, this was just a beautiful box!! I am so glad that <br/>
someone took<br/>
&gt; the time to mark this spot, and the stamp is my favorite so far-<br/>
wonderful.<br/>
&gt; I was honored to stamp in to this LB. Thank you for thinking of <br/>
such a<br/>
&gt; great spot. It's a shame that this part of U.S. history seems to <br/>
have been<br/>
&gt; forgotten.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I won't say more so I don't spoil a "mystery" for others. Thanks <br/>
for the<br/>
&gt; extras in the box. That added to the moment. Anyone out here <br/>
should go<br/>
&gt; find this spot.<br/>

&gt; ps. ZenRoxie, While I was out that direction, I went ahead and <br/>
found that<br/>

&gt;      Just Curious, Which type of GPS do you like? What kind do you <br/>
use in<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt;      tracking? Do you think LB clues and geocaching go together?<br/>
&gt;               Carrying around a GPS is kind of like having a <br/>
camera when<br/>
&gt;      others that are around don't know what you are up to. Kind of <br/>
makes you<br/>
&gt;      look like you are "on a mission" and everything is ok. What <br/>
do you<br/>
&gt;      think?<br/>
