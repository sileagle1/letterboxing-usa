Well, both are likely to be a factor, but it's just part of the<br/>
growing pains. A system that works well with 1000 boxes may not work<br/>
well when it gets 10,000, and a system designed for 10,000 boxes may<br/>
not work well with 100,000 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
But that's not to say it can't handle 100,000 boxes. Just that<br/>
additional optimizations are needed. And likewise, a system designed<br/>
to support 100 people might crack when 1000 are using it.<br/>
<br/>
But that's not to say you should try to avoid hosting your clues on<br/>
LbNA either.<br/>
<br/>
AQ suffers the same problems on occasion. I had to rewrite the message<br/>
boards twice already. First when it got more than about 1,000 messages<br/>
posted, then again when it started getting around 10,000 messages. I<br/>
fully expect I might have to rewrite some more code when it ends up<br/>
with 100,000 messages, but that's a bridge I'll cross when I come to it.<br/>
<br/>
All things considered, the actual hosting of the clue doesn't take up<br/>
much space or cause problems. It's complex the queries that search,<br/>
sort, and filter the boxes so you can see just the boxes you want to<br/>
see that's processor intensive. Hosting the clues somewhere else won't<br/>
fix problems like that. <br/>
<br/>
Just keep using LbNA like always. It might have growing pains, but all<br/>
is well. *nodding*<br/>

 We are trying to get everyone in our area here in South Western Ohio<br/>
to do just that. We set up Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana sites in SWOGO.ORG<br/>
to put the clues on. The clues are linked from our site. It's also nice as<br/>
you can leave messages about the boxes after you find them. The site<br/>
is totally free to use. All you have to do is make an account and post your<br/>
boxes. You do not need an account to access the listed boxes. It;s really<br/>
kind of nice.<br/>

know, "Gosh, she doesn't know anything about it, but that's our solution.  What a genius!"<br/>

Obviously, as a friend of mine puts it, I misspelled genius.  In this case, it would be <br/>
"genie-ass!"<br/>

&gt; &gt; If this is the case, would it be possible to create a small<br/>
&gt; &gt; application for both Windows and Macs that could download all of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues, update them every time you logged in, and then enabled you to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do all of the search aspects using the user's machine rather than<br/>
&gt; &gt; doing the calculations via the web?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Downloading ALL the clues would be significantly worse for performance<br/>
&gt; than doing a search and downloading just the clues that the person needs.<br/>
