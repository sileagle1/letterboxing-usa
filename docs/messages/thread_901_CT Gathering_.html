We were up to Connecticut, and Rocky Neck, but unfortunately couldn't find<br/>
anyone we recognized.  We walked around the two open camping areas, and ran<br/>
into some Coast Guard Academy students, but that was it.  So we spent the rest<br/>
of the day hunting down boxes.  I was hoping to see a big banner on a site or<br/>
something, announcing the location of the 2nd annual letterbox gathering! :)<br/>
Since we couldn't bring the dog in, we couldn't stay long with him in the car<br/>
:(  If there weren't so many boxes there, we might have had hopes of running<br/>
into a few people on the trail.  Every box we found did not have a single<br/>
stamp from that weekend.  I figure it will only take about three more weekends<br/>
to clear out CT.  Four if you figure in the rate that the Drew clan hides<br/>
them.  We had some very nice hikes though, and regret that we didn't get the<br/>
chance to run into all of you again.  I promise, the next weekend, we'll stay<br/>
with the group :)<br/>

John, you're right, it was great to finally meet you in person. And <br/>
I'm glad the thundery lightening didn't dampen anyone's spirits!<br/>

though.  You must have missed the note about the red VW bus ;)<br/>

BTW, the kids are getting ready to hit your boxes in NJ.  Should be a <br/>
couple of nice days of letterboxing this summer.  Will let you know <br/>
how we fare.<br/>
