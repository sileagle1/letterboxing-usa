If I'd have checked it a week ago, you wouldn't have had to search <br/>

tabs on them. :)<br/>

&gt; Hope you find it, and I didn't waste your time.  I tried my best <br/>
to locate, but 1st time I stopped a guy was selling eggs there.  I <br/>
came back later and another guy was sleeping in his car about 20 <br/>
yards away.  <br/>

 Oh, about my 'Pencil Me In' letterbox... I will visit it tomorrow <br/>
with bug spray, gloves, and a hooked stick to try to take it back <br/>
from the fire ants. Wish me luck! ;)<br/>

Are you going to replace it?  I hope to be down that way later this <br/>
month and might have time to go after this box and your other ones.<br/>
You can let me know off-list if and when you plan to replace it.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
