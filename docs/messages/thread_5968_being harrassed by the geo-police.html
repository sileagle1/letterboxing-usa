                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,  has anyone else been harrasssed by well meaning geo-cachers who <br/>
think it it their job to check up on the condition of your letterbox/geocache <br/>
combinations?  Sometimes six emails a day.<br/>
<br/>
I have got some wet boxes out in my home area that I have posted a note to on <br/>
the geocahe websites that I plan on drying them out as soon as I can.  But <br/>
apparently certain people consider wet boxes as geo-trash and have been <br/>
hounding me to clean them up.  The problem is this ...I haven't had a chance. <br/>
 That is why I posted the note that they were wet or that I had brought them <br/>
home to dry out.  I didn't archive them on purpose since once archived it is <br/>
harder to access the cache page.<br/>
<br/>
  My boxes are not trash ... just some are in need of maintenance <br/>
...maintenance which I plan to give them this month.  I am guessing that a <br/>
few retired folks with extra time have appointed themselves the geocache <br/>
police in my area...   No that being retired is bad .... I plan on being <br/>
retired someday soon too.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
ANYway ...crab session over.  I just wondered if this is a trend across the <br/>
country or just in my area?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
PS: I'm not slamming geocachers ... cause I enjoy that game too.<br/>
