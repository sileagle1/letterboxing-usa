                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to congratulate a few folks who recently attained new<br/>
personal goals in their PFX counts.  Silent Doug (formerly of PA, now<br/>
of CT) reached PFX1000 on May 8th, while Jennifer reached F500 last<br/>
Dec 5th.  Silver Eagle of Texas reached PFX1000 on May 27th, and The<br/>
Engraver of CT hit F1000 on May 18th!  Great going on the boxing guys,<br/>
and the bunch of new plants, too!<br/>
<br/>
We suspect several other folks out there who have been extra busy<br/>
lately all around the country must be reaching high box counts by now,<br/>
too, but unless they tell us, we won't know for sure.  So, again for<br/>
the record, anyone who gets a combined PFX count of 500 or above,<br/>
please just send an e-mail reply to us giving the approximate date you<br/>
reached that goal, and we'll be glad to add your name to the list! <br/>
(See our web page<br/>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html#pfxclubs ).<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I wanted to mention that just the other day my husband, Pete,<br/>
reached his long term personal goal of F5000 at Tidal Tree Ark in CT,<br/>
and we had a nice little celebration!  I used to always like to tease<br/>
Pete about being the only other person in the whole country who has<br/>
found more than half as many boxes as I have, but in truth I'm<br/>
extremely proud of him for managing to do all those boxes while still<br/>
working full time year round!  Congratulations to Pete, my sweetheart,<br/>
and everyone else who's getting out there to enjoy some wonderful<br/>
prolific letterboxing!<br/>

P.S. Watch for Pete's F5000 letterbox and news about our "Lifetime<br/>
Letterboxing Achievement Award" coming out soon!  :-)<br/>
