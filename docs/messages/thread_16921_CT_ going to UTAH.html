&gt; Snowbird-- thanks so much for the invite, it sounds so good, I just<br/>
might change my flight !! Actually I have a loonngg wait in Baltimore<br/>
and that would be exciting to have some exchanges there.  Even have<br/>
them stamp into the boxes going to Utah !! Thanks again for the kind<br/>
invite.  Perhaps another time .<br/>
