Although it's mostly Dude the Wonder Dog and I, H&amp;H consists of Irene, Carvin' Carmen (my son) and Deb (my sister). The hounds are Dude, Jasmine and Cody. All have their own stamps. I always have Dude with me and will often have one of the other hounds as well, usually Cody. Jasmine is a year old pit/lab mix and is going through a "not listening very well" stage and is too strong for me to handle on a leash. Once she calms down, she be back out on trail. Dude has gotton so good at letterboxing he often sniffs out the boxes for me, and he knows that when he sees me emerge from wherever with a pieice of plastic in my hand that we will be staying in that spot for a little while so he immediately lays down and patiently waits for me to stamp in. <br/>
