Glad you're back in the fold, as I only heard of you from legend.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan didn't cross post, he pointed folks to a website. I do that very often with Silent <br/>
Doug's site b/c it contains soooo much useful info. I think Ryan was just living the old-<br/>
school list vibe by posting that he had resumed his hiking adventures. I don't think he <br/>
cross posted that across all the groups.<br/>
<br/>
Pointing folks to a site, useless to folks who don't know about Ryan's Adventures (in this <br/>
case) may be vs. pointing them to Silent Doug's link library (for instance) isn't a bad thing. <br/>
It actually helps out a lot of folks, which you should well know. Ryan may have taken <br/>
liberty in posting his adventures link on the main list, but the list was a lot different in <br/>
those days. BTW, those adventure posts to the main list have long ceased.<br/>
<br/>
In the RavenH scene, having a signature at the bottom of every email you post to the list <br/>
saying that an alternate way of boxing exists on such and such website, and please join it!, <br/>
is annoying after a while. It is even advertising on someone else's website, in a way. I have <br/>
absolutely nothing against the lbworld; I even posted RavenH's evaluation of a blender pen <br/>
(another unpopular topic) on my site and have corresponded with him with cordial results. <br/>
But to get almost spammed with several posts a day, always accompanied by the junk-<br/>
mail sig at the bottom, did get bothersome. Especially when it hit every list.<br/>
<br/>
Just telling you the whole picture here. This is not a judgement.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It seems a few people out there were surprised to learn that once <br/>
&gt; &gt; again I have started writing more of my Great Adventures.  I didn't <br/>
&gt; &gt; post about them here since it didn't have to do with the <br/>
&gt; Appalachian <br/>
&gt; &gt; Trail or letterboxing in any way, but for those of you who want to <br/>

It just felt to me like something sneaky has been going on behind the <br/>
scenes.  And I think others felt that way, too.  It has become a very <br/>
huge issue here in the PNW.  I do not believe for one minute that any <br/>

WoL.  But I think it's naive to be surprised that people suspect <br/>

our moderators without establishing what the rules are officially.  <br/>
All I was trying to say, is that if we can't be upfront about what's <br/>
happening, don't be surprised if people react with suspicion.  Like I <br/>
said, censorship breeds mistrust.<br/>

voices around here and most of it is probably excessive, including my<br/>
own.  But, as he has so accurately concluded: "censorship breeds<br/>
mistrust".  The censorship issue rooted my question of whether there<br/>
are moderators or dictators?<br/>
<br/>
And hello to ndnboxing, whom I would also like to respond to.  I<br/>
understand that it may have been annoying to see Steve's website<br/>
promotion at every post, but the fact of the matter is (for me) that<br/>
there are a lot of annoying things about this list.  By no fault of<br/>
the people in it, but there just wasn't a "place" for everyone.  New<br/>
people began to be treated like street bums.  Not only that, but<br/>
regional posts were "forced" upon everyone simply by the nature of<br/>
this list.  Responses to posts are scattered through the list and hard<br/>
to follow.  Fueds ensue and all of it gets emailed to everyone whether<br/>
they want to read it or not.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of having a forum (lbworld.org) was a vast improvement for<br/>
all the above reasons.  Trying to direct people there wasn't<br/>
compitition as much as a desire for the above problems to cease for<br/>
the sake of peace and resourcefulness.<br/>
<br/>
And by the nature of "list posting", responses to a certain thread are<br/>
read by people who missed the entirety of that thread and begin to<br/>
take comments personally when they aren't meant as such... at least<br/>
not to them.  Viola... fued.<br/>
<br/>
I don't like it, but for "some reason" it's the only option I have to<br/>
say what I feel.  If this was lbworld you could just ignore the<br/>
thread, but... it isn't.<br/>
