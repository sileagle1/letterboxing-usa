spending at least part of Mother's Day letterboxing. Things <br/>
started departing from the script when Puppy Boy (3) and Queen <br/>
Maureen (18 mos) were the ones clamoring to come and the <br/>
older kids were happy to stay slack-eyed in front of Nickelodeon <br/>
at Grammy's. So much for the Queen napping while we went <br/>
with the big kids.<br/>
<br/>
More script departures: we told Grammy that we'd start with <br/>
Remnants of the Past since it's a drive-by (wrong), that we'd go <br/>
next to another box (wrong), and that we'd be back in about 2 <br/>
hours (right). Remnants wasn't what I'd expected--it was much <br/>
better (Psychomommy's usual nice job). However, by the time <br/>
we figured out where we were going and pushed a stroller <br/>
around with 2 kids in then one in and one out and then two out <br/>
and kept Queen Maureen from eating too many rocks, time had <br/>
flown and we had to head back to the others before their brains <br/>
turned to jello.<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice follow-up to rescuing part of the Scooby gang on <br/>
Saturday. Of course, the rain started as soon as we hit the trail. <br/>
After rescuing Scooby, Barbie Girl was ready to head home, so <br/>
she headed to the car with Dad and the Queen in tow. Only <br/>
Rescue Boy and Puppy Boy were brave enough/stupid enough to <br/>
continue on. After a delay with the second box because KnitWit <br/>
Mom had forgotten how to use a compass in a month of no <br/>
boxing, we reached our time limit before Dad would begin to <br/>
panic and call in the Mounties to find us.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great weekend. 'Boxing--even in the rain--beats <br/>
working any day.<br/>
