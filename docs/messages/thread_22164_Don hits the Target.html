the idiot's moniker in my subject line and I will make no more posts on this topic. If <br/>
you must discuss this situation, do it one on one in private email but not on this list. <br/>
PLEASE!  <br/>

What joy could anyone possibly find in destroying another person's artwork? If this is <br/>
for real, I feel sorry for those involved. Funhog<br/>
