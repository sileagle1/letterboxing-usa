<p><br/>We had a great weekend letterboxing.  First we went to Loriella and found bent tree #1 and #2 &amp; played 12 holes of Disc golf while we were there. Strved for food ~ 3pm we headed to Vinnie's, which is across the street and up about 2 blocks. Then went to Custus memoral Park and found Fish or Fowl.  Thats a really cool stamp.  Then we headed over to Letterbox at Fredericksburg Confederate Cemetery.  The second log book is full so I took the last 4 pages out of my book and left them in the box to stamp in.  DL (Disc Lava) hit is 100th find at the box.  We left Fredericksburg after buying cheep gas $1.50 (cheeper then N. VA) and having Carl's icecream.  I can't think of a better way to spend a day.  Loriella, Vinnie's and Carl's and some great stamps.</p>
