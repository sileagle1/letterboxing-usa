                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am new to letterboxing, and live currently in the Boise area of Idaho.  Der Mad Stamper left a box at the Birds of Prey area, to which <br/>
after my second try I am 99.99% sure I found the hiding spot, but alas, no box!!!  What a disappointment, since as far as I know, it is <br/>
the only box in the state, and certainly hte other closest ones are not readily feasible for me.  I was hoping someone out there would <br/>
be helpful in letting me know how to get started in all this, obviously this state needs more boxes!  Also, I wanted to get ahold of Der <br/>
Mad Stamper to let him know the box has been absconded with (I assume).   Does anyone know his email address?  I had a great <br/>
time learning to find the box that wasn't there!  Was really hoping to generate more interest in this state and start a few boxes.  Could <br/>
sure use some help as far as what all besides stamps would a person put or not put in a box?  I guess whatever I want???<br/>

<br/>
How's letterboxing in Idaho coming along?<br/>
<br/>
I found the trail of that paper document that I print up and place in Zip-Loc bags in all of my letterboxes. I'll attach it as a Word document. Let me know if you have any problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
It's set up so you can make two copies the page back-to-back, then slice each sheet down the middle to make two 8.5 X 5.5 copies per sheet of paper. I put about a dozen in each letterbox, but your mileage may vary.<br/>
<br/>
We're still snowed under here, but there's been a little melting going on. Oddly, the high country doesn't have much snow, but the valleys are covered. It's never the same two years in a row!<br/>
<br/>
The family and I are going to San Diego in a couple weeks. I plan to set out a letterbox or two in San Diego County, and maybe (finally) collect a few stamps from boxes other people have set out. <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
