Difficulty: flat riding ( 20 mile round trip as described) <br/>
            boxes accessable by foot by parking in various <br/>
            locations along the way<br/>

<br/>
We planted some of these for a cookout event for some friends who are <br/>
cyclists and letterboxers, so they stamped in some of them on <br/>
Father's Day. Thanks to them for their patience tryign out the <br/>
directions, maybe they've forgiven us. We've added a couple more <br/>
boxes, hope to add still more along the path, and hope others will <br/>
too. <br/>
<br/>
   Guide to a series of letterboxes near the East Bay Bicycle Path   <br/>
           Any day of the week this path sees plenty of use by people <br/>
using all types of pollution free transportation. We've been riding <br/>
bikes in and around the path since the early phases of its <br/>
construction and saw this as a way of celebrating the path and its <br/>
diverse users. We've only been letterboxing for a couple of months <br/>
but we've already been made aware of so many nifty places we never <br/>
would have visited otherwise and wanted to do the same for others.  <br/>
We were inspired to make East Bay Bike Path the scene of our first <br/>
attempts at "giving back" a little by our experience at the <br/>
excellent "Hills are Alive" series a couple of weeks ago. We hope to <br/>
add more and hope others might as well. <br/>
<br/>
Series I  <br/>
	The directions are given as though traveling from the <br/>
southern end of the path in Bristol but one might enter at any point <br/>
and figure it out. Some of the boxes can easily) be accessed (three <br/>
and six year old granddaughters helped set them out from parking <br/>
areas nearby. Some are a little ways off the path to show off nearby <br/>
parks and through neighboring areas along our habitual routes we <br/>
first picked up from Narragansett Wheelmen rides. It might be a good <br/>
idea to change the order of visiting the boxes to spread them over an <br/>
out and back ride. Reliable parking for the southern end of the path <br/>
is available at the Independence Park terminus in Bristol (get there <br/>
early), off the entrance road for Colt State Park, behind the Warren <br/>
Town Hall, the Barrington Shopping Center, and at Haines Park in East <br/>
Providence.   <br/>
<br/>
The Jogger<br/>
Starting at Colt State Park where ample parking is available in a <br/>
large lot on the entrance road to the park (across from the armory). <br/>
Take a left out of the lot and follow the main road as it bears left <br/>
at the first fork, then at the entrance kiosk go around the rotary <br/>
and down the hill to the small jogger's parking lot (home of the East <br/>
Bay Striders according to the sign) Begin to follow Ah Doo Wah Blvd <br/>
and immediately after passing through the first stone wall look low <br/>
in the wall directly behind the tree bearing the Ah Doo Wah Blvd. <br/>
sign. (You may want to take a spin through this walking/biking path <br/>
that goes through the park)<br/>
<br/>
The Chair Wheeler<br/>
	Leaving the jogger's parking lot, turn right and exit the <br/>
park with a left turn onto Poppasquash Road. Follow this around the <br/>
back of Bristol Harbor and turn left onto the East Bay Bicycle Path. <br/>
(You may want to take a quick detour down to the right for a few <br/>
hundred yards to Independence Park to say you went to the end. If <br/>
you're hungry there are several places to eat here.) Follow the bike <br/>
path northward. <br/>
After passing through Warren (There is a bike shop and a Del's frozen <br/>
lemonade stand right on the path near the Warren Town Hall) the bike <br/>
path crosses over two bridges into Barrington. After the second <br/>
bridge (nothernmost) enter a shady section of the path which leads up <br/>
to the Barrington shopping center. Along part of this shady section <br/>
is a stone wall on the left (west) side. When you get to the third in <br/>
a series of four sewer covers in the grassy verge on your right <br/>
(east), stop and count back (south) forty paces along the path and <br/>
face the wall.  You should be about halfway between two double <br/>
trunked maple trees behind you (on the east side of the path). The <br/>
box is in the usual crevice in the wall. This is a busy stretch with <br/>
a long line of sight. You might want to sit on the wall and fake <br/>
taking a rest to avoid suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
The Coffee Break<br/>
	Continue north on the path turn right at the intersection of <br/>
County Street instead of crossing at the light. A few short blocks <br/>
along County Street, before the town hall, at the corner of Markwood <br/>
Drive is a small park with a pond and a gazebo. The benches here are <br/>
perfect places to sit and sample a coffee from one of the sources <br/>
within sight. Stand on the path to the gazebo with your back to it <br/>
and you should see a large "boxy" evergreen. A quick search in the <br/>
base of its multiple trunks should yield a find. You can return to <br/>
the bike path by back the way you came or by crossing County Street <br/>
here (carefully, there is a crosswalk nearby) and bearing off toward <br/>
the path via a number of entry ramps. Anyone who doesn't believe that <br/>
businesses can benefit from a bike path should see this place. You <br/>
are nearly five miles north of Colt State Park at this point.  Head <br/>
northward if you want more.<br/>
<br/>
The Rollerblader<br/>
North of the Barrington shopping center turn left on the next street <br/>
(West Street) pass the YMCA and enter Veterans Memorial Park. Follow <br/>
the road to a lot at the end and look for a sign for fireplace 11 <br/>
near a gate. Peek among the triple trunks for The Rollerblader.<br/>
<br/>
The Tired Cyclist <br/>
	Return to the bike path and continue north to an intersection <br/>
with Washington Road and turn left. Follow Washington Road until, <br/>
just as you see a golf course on the left ( Rhode Island Country <br/>
Club, scene of Rhody's only annual PGA tournament) turn left onto <br/>
South Lake Road (one-way traffic). A few hundred feet later there <br/>
will be a large white birch on the left and shortly after that a <br/>
large fallen log across from a No Parking sign. Check under the <br/>
northern end of the log for the Tired Cyclist. <br/>
<br/>
The Walker<br/>
	Continue along South Lake Road through the fishing spots <br/>
along the edge of this pond called Echo Lake, crossing North Lake <br/>
Road and intercepting the bike path again. Turn left (northward ) and <br/>
continue on to the marker on the southbound side that says <br/>
"6 mi S". Keep an eye out for a short spur of pavement on the right <br/>
(guarded at its end by two boulders) that leads into a network of <br/>
trails in part of Haines Memorial State Park. Enter here and turning <br/>
left at the first trail intersection count about 45 paces. Here <br/>
should be a path that leads off to the left (SW) back toward the bike <br/>
path. Walk along here about 22 paces and sight through the center <br/>
(approx. WNW) of the clump of a four trunk oak tree to an aspen tree <br/>
about 15 feet beyond.  The Walker rests at the base of this aspen. <br/>
<br/>
If you return to the bike path, turn right and continue north to the <br/>
picnic area of Haines Park there are rest rooms and places to stop <br/>
for a snack while looking at some boats.  <br/>
