<br/>
It's been a while since we were in Hawaii, but we did find the following<br/>
boxes on the Big Island in November 2003:<br/>
<br/>
Dreams<br/>
Bird of Paradise<br/>
Koki'o<br/>
Petroglyphs<br/>
Orchid Isle<br/>
<br/>
None of them required a 4WD.  For "Dreams" we simply parked at the top and<br/>
walked down the steep hill.  However that was probably the scariest box hunt<br/>
we've had...  Surf was very strong and it was very tricky getting across the<br/>
channel.  We wore water shoes &amp; swimsuits, attached our boxing gear to our<br/>
shoulders and waded across.  First getting pushed one way by the surf coming<br/>
in, then getting sucked out to sea.  Martini Man managed to get across, got<br/>
a large branch that we could use to balance us and then came back to help me<br/>
across.  I think we would have been better off crossing further away from<br/>
the beach. We still talk about that adventure, one of our earliest boxing<br/>
quests!!<br/>
<br/>
If you look for Petroglyphs, I've had a report that the box is cracked.<br/>
It's a fairly sizable stamp (3"x3") so would need a decent sized box if you<br/>
are able to replace it.  It's a box we adopted from the Letterboxing<br/>
Basement and is quite "old"  (2001).  I've been very happy to get several<br/>
reports each year on that box.  It is also near a nice beach if you're<br/>
inclined to take a relaxing break along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great trip!!!<br/>

<br/>
I looked over the list (12 boxes listed for Big Island on the <br/>
letterboxing website) and I think the only ones that "require" a 4WD <br/>
would be the Waipio one (Dreams) and maybe the Ocean View one <br/>
(Magical Manuka Bay)?  I say that because some of the regular streets <br/>
in Ocean View require 4WD and the placer said it is required. LOL  <br/>
There is a sign posted at the top of Waipio Valley that says <br/>
you "have to" have 4WD to drive down the hill.  There are cars over <br/>
the edge of the hill to prove it! If it's raining I would not even go <br/>
down with 4WD!  LOL  I don't think you need to have a 4WD to go down <br/>
the road to south point (unless you're going to the Green Sand <br/>
Beach).  It's just a narrow road and parts are not paved.  When you <br/>
get to the end there might be some deeper sand.<br/>
<br/>
We're in New Mexico now but we lived on the Big Island for eight <br/>
years.  I have friends there that do geocaching and I'm sure they <br/>
would go to Holoholokai and replace that box for you.  I actually <br/>
already sent them an e-mail about it since they live on the Kona side <br/>
and travel to Mauna Lani area often.  I'll let you know when they <br/>
reply!  I wish I knew about Letterboxing when I lived there...I could <br/>
take you to some heavenly places not on the maps! ;-)<br/>

&gt; Thanks for the "insider" info! I would still love to know about some of<br/>
&gt; those places that "aren't on the maps," though. Perhaps they're potential<br/>
&gt; planting locations...? I have an idea for my own box I'd like to place, but<br/>
&gt; I'm not sure if it'll work. Also, I know of a few areas not on the map since<br/>
&gt; my relatives live there and talk about all the places they go. Any tips<br/>
&gt; about touring the island in general would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Thanks!<br/>
