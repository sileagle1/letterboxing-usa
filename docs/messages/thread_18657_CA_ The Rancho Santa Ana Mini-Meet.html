                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to thank Purple Iris for suggesting the SoCal mini-meet of <br/>
April 17th at the Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Gardens.  I had such a <br/>
great time, especially because of the unexpected rainI'm a big rain <br/>
lover.  The Southern California letterboxers are unlike other <br/>
Southern Californians in that they don't let a little rain get in the <br/>
way of having a good time; we all sat down in the rain, mostly on the <br/>
ground, and exchanged stamps with no rain-related complaints at all!  <br/>
(In SoCal, the previous sentence deserves an exclamation point.)  My <br/>
wife called my cell phone in the middle of the stamp exchanges, and I <br/>
told her that children were standing among us holding up umbrellas so <br/>
our stamp books wouldn't get soaked.  Besides myself, attending the <br/>
event were Purple Iris, Spacy Holly and her clan:  Erin, Sara, Amy, <br/>
Lynn, and her husband Dan; and Leslie with her two daughters, Emma <br/>
and Claire.  Claire's "The Rose" letterbox was my 100th letterbox <br/>
find.  I gave Emma my first ever hitchhiker, "The Horus Hitchhiker," <br/>
and she reciprocated by giving me "The Arizona Hitchhiker," which I <br/>
placed in a box at the Kernville Gathering a week later.  Leslie's <br/>
folk and I were able to find the Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Gardens <br/>
Letterbox (which was one of the first LBs I ever searched for, but <br/>
was skunked at the time), so I imagine a great day was had by all.  <br/>
