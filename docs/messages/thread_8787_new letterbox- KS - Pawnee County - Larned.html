<br/>

<br/>
Difficulty - simple<br/>
Time - Plan an hour or two for the museum and your tour will bring<br/>
you right by the box.<br/>
Directions to starting place- The Santa Fe Trail Center is located 2 <br/>
miles west of Larned, Kansas on K-156.<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know -<br/>
The box is located inside the museum's grounds and is, therefore, <br/>
inaccessible when the museum is closed.  It is a great museum and<br/>
well worth your time to visit.  Museum hours are 9-5 Tuesday -<br/>
Sunday. There is a small admission fee.<br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know, but might enjoy - <br/>
"Unlike the other great Western trails, the Santa Fe Trail was a two <br/>
way route between two different countries: the United States and <br/>
Mexico. By the early 1840's the majority of private freight caravans <br/>
were owned and operated by New Mexicans. The Mexican War ended the <br/>
international days of the trail, when New Mexico was added to the<br/>
U.S. territory."   The  museum has artifacts and information up until <br/>
the World War I era.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:		<br/>
As you face the front door turn right and go to the sod building.   <br/>
