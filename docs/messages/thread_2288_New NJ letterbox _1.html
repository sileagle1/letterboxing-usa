<br/>
Note: This clue begins as a road rally, then turns into a hike on <br/>
foot.<br/>
<br/>
The trip starts on Route 78 West. Take Exit 15; at the bottom of <br/>
the exit make a right on to West Main Street. Go 3/10 of a mile. <br/>
When you see an Amoco station make a left, and head past the <br/>
Clinton House. Behind the Clinton House you'll find Clinton falls; <br/>
make a right, go over the bridge (you'll be on Main Street), park <br/>
your car and check out the town for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Once you're back in your car, continue down Main Street. At the <br/>
intersection of Leigh and Main, make a right. At the next light, <br/>
make another right, back onto West Main Street. Continue until <br/>
you go under Route 78. Go straight through two traffic lights. <br/>
Wave to the bad grrlz on your right. You are now on Route 513. If <br/>
you are here late in the day, keep your eyes open for hot-air <br/>
balloons.<br/>
<br/>
Make a right onto Perryville Road. Follow this road to the end; at <br/>
the intersection of Perryville and Main Street, make a right (go <br/>
over the railroad tracks) and continue onwards. At the stop sign, <br/>
make a right turn onto Route 625 (Charlestown Road). Just <br/>
before the traffic light, you'll pass the Perryville Inn on your left (an <br/>
excellent dining spot). Keep going straight, back over Route 78. <br/>
Make a right at Van Syckels Road (you'll see a small sign <br/>
marking Van Syckel's Tavern). After exactly 1.5 miles, turn right <br/>
into a small, unpaved parking area marked by an "Alcoholic <br/>
Beverages Prohibited" sign.<br/>
<br/>
Now, on foot: After entering the parking lot, go to the southeast <br/>
corner. Here, take the left path (do not go to the path on the right, <br/>
which leads towards the water).<br/>
<br/>
Follow the wide trail for exactly 200 feet (about 100 paces); the <br/>
trail will bend gently toards the right. While on the path, you will <br/>
see a dead tree with 4 (or 5?) dead limbs sticking out of the top. <br/>
If the brush isn't too thick, you will also see a light blue metal <br/>
signpost in front of it.<br/>
<br/>
Continue along the path towards the right (you'll pass the tree <br/>
and signpost on your left). After a few more feet, the path will get <br/>
narrow and take a sharp left; continue down the path until you hit <br/>
the waterfront at Fisherman's point. Go right about 10 paces and <br/>
reconnect with the path.<br/>
<br/>
Go 15 paces down the path. To your right you'll see a small <br/>
concrete pit. Five paces after the pit, follow the trail to the <br/>
southwest, away from the water. After 10 paces, head off the trail, <br/>
towards the right to the tree with the significant brush residing at <br/>
its base. Behind the tree is a pile of rocks where the letterbox <br/>
lives.<br/>
