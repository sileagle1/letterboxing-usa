&gt;Does anyone know the status of these boxes or have the clues?  The <br/>
&gt;link through the VT page is invalid.<br/>
<br/>
Many of them won't be out until later in April.<br/>
<br/>
If you're really serious about the Valleyquest boxes, it's worth<br/>
getting the Valleyquest book at most any Upper Valley bookstore.<br/>

<br/>
Ya know you could have made this into a little<br/>
contest--who was the first to complete all 89 Quests? <br/>
Actually I guess that wouldn't have been much of a<br/>
contest now, would it? ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
_____________<br/>
Wanda, by the way, was the first to complete all 89<br/>
Quests!<br/>
<br/>
About 30 people have earned patches for completing 20!<br/>
