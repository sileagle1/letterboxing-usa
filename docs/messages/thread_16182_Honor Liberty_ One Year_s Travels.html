Gwen &amp; I don't normally post long reports but we feel that this report deserves some space and consideration. Right after 9-11-2001, I wanted never to see the Towers coming down as was shown over and over and over on TV. As more time passes I believe that we must remember and never forget that horrible day. If it was my choice I would have the various TV channels put the video on, if not monthly at least biannually. With that sentiment "Honor Liberty" was created to help us all remember. This obviously was a Hitch Hiker of a much different purpose, so a  different process for it's journey was used, finders were supposed to post on the chat list where it was placed not were it was found. Each finder had the opportunity to write their feelings in the log book and in some cases, the race was on when the location was posted. The following is a list of Honor Liberty's travels and some of the comments it generated.(Please excuse any omissions or errors).<br/>
<br/>
9/12/02 Don &amp; Gwen, Point Vicente Light House ,CA  launched ."Never Forget"<br/>
9/26/02 McJones "First to find and liberate Liberty"<br/>
12/1/02 Ryan went out of his way to pick her up in Montana de Oro at BMW 2002<br/>
12/22/02 Ron &amp; Kevin picked her up at Seven Falls. Kevin's own words, "The country in which we live is             the best country on this planet". Ron used another quote by Burke, "But what is Liberty                     without  wisdom &amp; virtue?"<br/>
12/29/02 Amanda grabbed her at Emma in Ennisbrook, 'Let Freedom Ring". She then took her for a ride             out of California to Washington.<br/>
1/18/03 DVN2RCKR (Adventure Seekers) went to Forest Runner and left these  comments in the log,             "God Bless America !!, 227 years of Freedom thanks to an incredible group of thoughtful                     Founding Fathers risking their lives to defy tyranny as they worked through many                                 issues  pursuing  righteous ideals in Philadelphia !!"<br/>
1/18/03 Quilting Noni picked her up and wrote, ''Praise God for our blessed nation. So many have                     sacrificed the ultimate price that the U.S.A. may enjoy Liberty. May we continue to vigilantly                 protect liberty of men on this precious land.".<br/>
1/19/03 Left Washington for Texas after being visited by My Favorite Things HH.  "Great honor- Have a             safe trip"<br/>
1/27/03 ARMYSWMR99 in the 4th ID and Patrick in 1st Cavalry Division found her In The Heart of                     Texas "Proudly serving our great country and on our  way out the door to honor and defend                 liberty in Operation Enduring Freedom"<br/>
2/1/03   Jason &amp; Aryn A Bear received her in Star ,Id. "We're so blessed that "Honor Liberty" visited us.             This means a lot to me (Aryn) as I was  stationed a mile a way on Sept.11,01. Talk about                     stress.Thanks to those still serving our great nation, God speed!"<br/>

4/5/03   The Kamms found her in Kalemazoo.<br/>
4/11/03 Azobox somehow handed her back to SpringChick who handed her off to Silent Doug, and he             decided Philadelphia would be a proper destination.<br/>
6/14/03 Pico, who was born 9/11/72, logged this entry, "We must have constantly present in our minds             the difference between  independence and liberty. Liberty is a right of doing whatever the                     laws permit, and if a citizen could do what they forbid he would no longer be  possessed of                 liberty" Montesquieu .<br/>
6/21/03 Rob Managlia, 2nd Airlift squadron ,USAF "Two weeks from joining Operation Desert                             Scorpion already in progress. 9-11 will never be  forgotten...."<br/>

We are leaving it off at the next                         nearest "Patriotic spot" that we know! "The Patriot" "Long Live Liberty"<br/>
