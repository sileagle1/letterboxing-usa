We planted a box bordering the 2nd hole of the Timberlin Golf Course <br/>
in Berlin, CT. It's the third box in the "Timberlin Park" series and <br/>
is aptly named "Ball and Tee". While not specifically intended to be <br/>
placed within the course, from this box, the walk back offers a <br/>
glimps of the first two holes. <br/>
<br/>
We were concerned the box would be found by golfers errant drives <br/>
though. <br/>
