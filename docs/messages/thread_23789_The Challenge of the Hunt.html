Knoebels and the Pirate gathering in CT, and both times I have seen <br/>
something that has distressed me, or at least confused me.<br/>
<br/>
I have been carrying a traveling event box that is basically a mystery <br/>
box that I set up on site.  You hunt for several boxes with clues that <br/>
in the end lead to the stamp.  It takes boxers several hours to figure <br/>
it all out as each clue in encrypted in a different way.<br/>
<br/>
What I observed was Pete at both gatherings hovering over the box as <br/>
people had finally finished the last clues and figured the box out. <br/>
Yesterday he even went so far as to follow Team Safari, who had been <br/>
working out the clues for hours, and then smoozing them into giving him <br/>
the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
My wondering is, has the stamp become so important that it negates the <br/>
challenge in the hunt?  Further, is it worth what comes down to stealing <br/>
other's work to get?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about others, but I find great satisfaction in actually <br/>
figuring things out.  That moment when you get into the mind of the <br/>
box's creator and think what he is thinking is exciting and thrilling. <br/>
As a planter, it is also a joy to see when someone realizes what you <br/>
were thinking, and figures their way through.  Where is the point in <br/>
getting a box if you are not going to get to that moment first?<br/>
<br/>
And working with someone to figure out a clue is one thing, but to <br/>
simply follow with no contribution in order to get the stamp is <br/>
something completely different, and I think, is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just the stamp, adding one more to the "F" count, that is <br/>
important?  I think the hunt is just as important, and just as enjoyable.<br/>

As you know, I started trying to figure this one out kind of late, since I <br/>
worked the event table for the first three hours or so of the morning.  I solved <br/>
a couple of the clues but then I must admit that I was frustrated that I <br/>
didn't think I could figure it out before you were planning to leave, so I gave up <br/>
for a bit.  I was willing to forgo the find since I didn't think I could <br/>
crack it, but I finally did!  I have to say that victory was very sweet because I <br/>
managed to follow the clues to the end, especially since I didn't intially <br/>
think that I could.<br/>
<br/>
As I was stamping in, Mike from the Pointer Party came and sat next to me.  I <br/>
said, "Oh, are you stamping in too?" thinking he'd solved it as well.  He <br/>
said no, he hadn't actually solved it, so he wasn't going to piggyback the find.  <br/>
He just wanted to see what the stamp looked like.  I thought that was <br/>
downright classy of him.  :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Cyclonic,<br/>
<br/>
This half of Team Safari helped Dan decode clues and Pete helped also. He<br/>
teamed up with us while I was still involved.  I couldn't spend any more<br/>
time and energy on it because we had not actually boxed at all out of the<br/>
immediate event area and I wanted to actually get out on a trail with my<br/>
friend (who had been waiting patiently for a very long time).<br/>
<br/>
Dan and Donutz were very intent on working this set of clues out, but not<br/>
me, so I went out to get a few boxes.  If you are a purist and want only<br/>
those who really solved all the clues to have credit for it, you can note in<br/>
your book that only Safari Man Dan, and not me, deserves credit next to our<br/>
stamp (with Donutz').  Had we not split up, neither of us would have found<br/>
any planted boxes on the trails.  That's how time consuming your clues were<br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't be offended, but I passed on spending any more time with your<br/>
clues. I felt that I was missing way too much.  The trouble with big<br/>
gatherings is that there is so much to do that you can never do everything.<br/>
It's a trade-off.  I had solved PTs and wanted to find the people, but<br/>
couldn't, or they were busy, or I got involved with event boxes and missed<br/>
people, or they were involved with other things and I really try not to be a<br/>
boar.  I wish we could have gone back for all the stamps we missed, but we<br/>
couldn't.  I'm glad I at least got to box a while and got the kids' series!!<br/>
I like the people, the boxes, the easy stamps, the challenges.  If I'd had a<br/>
few days I may have done it all. <s><br/>
<br/>
I like the challenge of the hunt and I enjoy working out hard clues, but not<br/>
to the exclusion of all else. One of the toughest PTs I had to figure out<br/>
was just a map and a cryptogram.  Dan saw me trying it and helped me work it<br/>
out, and his dad got in on it because he was intrigued. I'd share the credit<br/>
with them equally.<br/>
<br/>
If I find a box by myself or with a team, mystery or otherwise, and someone<br/>
comes up and asks to stamp in next, I never ask if they went to the same<br/>
trouble I did to find it.  All that matters to me is what I have done and<br/>
how I feel about my find.  I would never be a letterbox cop and deny another<br/>
boxer the chance to log in.  It's not my place.  And if I'm at a gathering,<br/>
I have a hard enough time keeping my head and my stuff straight, never mind<br/>
policing others.  I think my husband feels the same way, but if you want to<br/>
talk to him about it, I'll send you his email off list. He never reads the<br/>
groups, or looks up info on event or clues to print, but does his share of<br/>
solving and hiking with me... we are one team. We used to sign in with<br/>
separate stamps and kept separate logs but it was just a pain.  We now only<br/>
use one stamp, a team stamp, when we box together, even if we split up at a<br/>
gathering. If I go off alone or box with other friends, I use an old sig<br/>
stamp and try to leave a spot next to mine for Dan to log in if he gets that<br/>
box.  But that's just my way of looking at it and doing things.  If other<br/>
couples or groups signed in for each other, I couldn't care less.<br/>
<br/>
I can't say anything about what happened in the end when Dan finished your<br/>
box. I would like to ask you to please take it up with whomever you are<br/>
upset and not with the entire board. It's potentially hurtful and causes bad<br/>
feelings spreading out like water ripples and it makes some people<br/>
uncomfortable enough to not even read this list anymore.  I hope you can<br/>
resolve any confusion or personal issues with this, and continue to be a<br/>
contributing member of the letterboxing community.  Please contact me (us)<br/>
off list if you want to discuss this further.<br/>
<br/>
Yours in 'boxing,<br/>

Sure you can.  My daughter and I have several great photos of each<br/>
other from hunts which never resulted in finds -- sometimes we<br/>
misunderstood the clues, sometimes the box had been vandalized or just<br/>
gone.<br/>
(I hope you were being toung-in-cheek, but we're having so much fun<br/>
just hunting, the prize seems almost immaterial)<br/>

 A box is like a gift you give, we can only put so many srings on the gift. Some will choose <br/>
to honor our wishes and some will ignore them. <br/>
Images are very important to me and I have images of boxes I haven't found. I don't claim <br/>
them as finds, most of these I hope to find and then move to find catagory, others I have <br/>
no hope of. I also don't advertise my count. I've also tagged along on hunts that I had no <br/>
chance of finding the box myself, a certain Mapsurfer box comes to mind.<br/>
It an individual game and we all play a little differently. People who don't play with <br/>
integreity are only cheating themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is it just the stamp, adding one more to the "F" count, that is <br/>

Amen to that!  How many of us can say, having been at a gathering and <br/>
doing exchanges, that we have never accidentally stamped our signature <br/>
stamp in our book?  I haven't yet, but have almost done so.<br/>
