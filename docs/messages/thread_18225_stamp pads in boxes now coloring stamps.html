How do you color stamps &amp; what do you use?  This is an approach I <br/>
haven't even thought about.  Still just trying to carve a decent <br/>
stamp and not being very artistic to start with having to think <br/>
about color also boggles my poor little mind.  Currently I'm just <br/>
going with plain old black ink - dull I know.<br/>

How do you color stamps &amp; what do you use?  <br/>
<br/>
We use 2 different ways. Go to your local art supply or Michael's craft store <br/>
and buy La Plume pens. They are 'felt pens' with a large, brush-like tip on <br/>
one end and a finer point in the other in any color you can imagine. The other <br/>
is the 'duo' tip stamp pads that look a little like a tube of lipstick, found <br/>
in the stamp pad aisle. There are 2 colors on these and the tip is about the <br/>
size of a shirt button. Use either of these items to color the parts of a stamp <br/>
you want one color and other colors for the other parts of the stamp. <br/>
<br/>
You might be thinking, 'but won't the ink dry and not stamp by the time I've <br/>
applied all the colors?" Good question! After you're done, use a big, hot <br/>
breath, like you would if you were trying to warm your hands, to breathe on the <br/>
stamp. This will moisten the colors and you'll have a great rendition when you <br/>
stamp in. <br/>
<br/>
Hope we've made ourselves clear!<br/>

(like if it's a flower, you could use a yellow marker on the petals <br/>
and a green one on the stem).  Then you huff on it like you were <br/>
cleaning your glasses to moisten it, and stamp.  Some people use <br/>
rainbow stamp pads that just make stripes or swirls of color (I got <br/>
one at Walmart) that don't necessarily follow the lines of the stamp <br/>
but make it colorful just the same.<br/>

What you see is a stamp carved by a master.  She used colored pencils<br/>
to fill it in.  <br/>

If you used a black ink like Ancient Page or another waterproof ink<br/>
then if you wanted to you could use watercolors or other paint to fill<br/>
in the color.  <br/>
