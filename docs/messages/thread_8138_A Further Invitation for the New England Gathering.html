for the upcoming gathering.  Check your almanacs and the calendar.<br/>
<br/>
As is the tradition in letterboxing gatherings, I would welcome help <br/>
in placing special boxes in the area for the ocassion.  I have <br/>
already approached a gifted carver to create a piece of transferable <br/>
art for the event.  In addition, I have asked one of you to prepare a <br/>
special traveller that can only be found by divining the bearer.  <br/>
Finally, clues to my identity can be found at the gathering where I <br/>
will reward the seeker in a special stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
I invite you to congregate in the "longhouse" without sides by the <br/>
freshwater pond beginning two hours before moonrise to seek these <br/>
special stamps.  Your brethren have sprinkled the local area with a <br/>
surfeit of boxes.  I encourage you to have clues in hand to find the <br/>
local boxes, and placers of special boxes to post clues ahead or <br/>
bring them to the gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
One hour after moonrise we can break bread and exchange stamps <br/>
together.  Bring food to share and your own beverage and utensils to <br/>
sample the culinary art of your compatriots.<br/>
<br/>
The fair Lady Alafair has agreed to provide a special journal for the <br/>
event for all to log their arrival.  I also beseech you to bring any <br/>
fine examples of your carving to imprint in the journal to share with <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
As always I welcome any questions and will cheerfully provide <br/>
information or directions for those who need their invitiation <br/>
deciphered.<br/>
