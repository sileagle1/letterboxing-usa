<p>Im afraid I am in agreement about the excessive number of Hitchhikers. Ive also heard some off-list grumbling about there being too many and that they seem to have become <span> </span>the letterbox-of-least resistance. That there may be a disproportionate distribution is probably true as well. It is fun to find one that started its travels on the opposite coast and we are extremely fortunate that a few of us are able to transport them a fair distance so that others of us can be genuinely surprised when one has landed in our hand from far away. </p>
<p> <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Perhaps a swap or re-distribution of sorts could occur. If you find one in an area where there are many, why not post on-list for someone who lives in a state where there seems to be a drought of hitchhikers and just snail mail it to them as someone suggested. Perhaps this is a way to turn this whole thing that is a concern for some of us into an opportunity for others. If you are relocating a box via mail, I think it would be nice to contact the owner of the box as well to tell them what you are doing. </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Media Mail is a very inexpensive way to send things. After all, there is a book within a letterbox. </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Hitchhikers, as Randy stated and has demonstrated in his Hatbox Caper, can be as creative as any other letterbox. I think the essence of this is really part laziness and part boredom due to sheer overpopulation in some places, consistent lack of originality, and, frankly, a theme or stamp that means something to its creator but whose meaning is lost on the finder who doesnt read every announcement on the list that yet another hitchhiker has been set free. </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>What I am saying is that whatever goes into a hitchhiker that is not part of some obvious grander scheme should stand on its own so that it piques the finders interest upon discovery rather than depending on a post to the list to learn what it means. This takes extra thought and more time to be sure. </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You might argue why should a hitchhiker be different from a regular letterbox whose owner may give background information along with the clues? It is different because with a regular letterbox, there is a deliberateness in obtaining the clues which presumably tell the whole story if there is one. A person who finds a hitchhiker is deprived of that benefit because of the randomness of the find itself and the impossibility of knowing the owners motivation for setting it free unless it is blatantly obvious. </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>We all like letterboxes that are a little different or more challenging than  walk 10 paces and look behind the oak tree.<span>  </span>Hitchhikers can indeed be different or take on a different persona that sets them apart from the ones that are simply dropped off with another box and sent on their way. Sometimes, a bit of thought into the process itself, an ingenious stamp aside, has the potential to make them extraordinary and coveted instead of ordinary and, regretably, at times a chore to get rid of. </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And, while we are on the subject of hitchhikers, a minor personal experience comes to mind. I think that when you do find a hitchhiker, it is a good idea as well as common courtesy to contact the owner directly whenever possible, rather than announcing the find on-list. Remember, many letterboxers dont read the list or the two hitchhiker resources regularly or at all, but are interested in where their hitchhikers go. If there is an email address in the box, IMHO, it is usually the owners way of asking the finder to take two minutes to send an very brief email to them with a simple where and when. Ive had two in circulation for many months and have not gotten one email with regard to either one of them. From off-list discussions I have had, this seems to be a discouraging fact of life. </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Im not saying that we should stop creating hitchhikers. They ARE fun and they ARE a surprise. I agree with Ryan that given a choice between putting a hitchhiker out there and a regular letterbox, I'll stick with the latter...but to each his or her own. I think this is all about adding dimension, making letterboxing more interesting for everyone and making this wonderful hobby more personally challenging.</p>

<br/>
Another suggestion to go along with this.  Should the HH be <br/>
snail mailed the post mark and stamp on the package could be <br/>
added to the log book as well.  Just another log in its travels.<br/>
<br/>
Also, BCostley has created a special PO Letterbox for just such a <br/>
situation.  Anyone wanting to can contact Brett and get his P.O. <br/>
Box to mail any unwanted HH's to and he will graciously relocate <br/>
them. :)  (I hope I am not stepping on your toes here Brett but you <br/>
have set yourself up for this one already) <br/>
