box is located on PRIVATE fragile wetlands. Please follow the <br/>
directions carefully in this clue and you will be rewarded. If anyone <br/>
has particular difficulty finding it, please contact PHYTO!!<br/>
<br/>
The ESTES LAKE LOON box has been found by first finders and new <br/>
boxers NAUTILUS &amp; CULEX. Give them a warm welcome to this hobby as <br/>
I'm sure they will extend their talents and knowledge of the outdoors <br/>
to everyone in Maine and beyond. Thanks guys!!<br/>

The boxes are intact and hidden quite well.  Please enjoy this little <br/>

BAXTER WOODS SERIES has presented some challenge to several visitors. <br/>
Upon checking on the boxes on Monday, I have revamped the clue for <br/>
box #3 to be more direct. Please update your clues and again, email <br/>
me if there are any questions. The boxes are all present and <br/>
accounted for at this spot!<br/>
