I post on many groups, and one..New Boxers, has a "Topic of the <br/>
Week".  This week's topic is:<br/>
<br/>
"Do you have a boxing buddy or do you go out alone?  If you do box <br/>
alone do you have any tips to share?"<br/>
<br/>
This was my response to it, and I thought it would be good to post it <br/>
here as well, as many "newbies" join the letterboxing world each day, <br/>
I thought it would be good to remind people of some of the things <br/>
that seem old hat to long standing members of the letterboxing <br/>
communitity!  I know others might be on different groups as well, and <br/>
you may receive this more than once, for that I apologize, just <br/>
trying to catch newbies to each group as not everyone is signed up <br/>
with several like I am! *Smiles*<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I replied, hope it helps others:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   When I first discovered letterboxing, I had originally wanted it <br/>
to be something that my wife, Shannon, and I could go out and enjoy <br/>
together or with other friends that would be into hiking and <br/>
stamping.  She suggested that the kids might like it as well, get <br/>
them away from the tv and video games and out into the fresh air and <br/>
sunshine. They do like letterboxing...however, much to my dismay, it <br/>
has become a competition for them and I find myself more irritated <br/>
with their bickering back and forth rather than enjoying the time <br/>
spent with them.  They are 10, 12, 14 and 16 and I think that only <br/>
the 16 year old actually "gets it".  What should be an enjoyable <br/>
adventure outdoors has become something I do not look forward to <br/>
doing with them.  We have been out on four letterboxing runs....and <br/>
the kids seem to think that they each always have to be the FIRST one <br/>
to find the box, the FIRST one to stamp in, the FIRST one to stamp <br/>
their own logbook and it has become a mad dash to the hiding spot.  <br/>
We try to have them take turns but it of course always starts more <br/>
arguments. All I can figure is the kids seem to think that not <br/>
everyone is going to get a chance to stamp in, like in the <br/>
old "Mission Impossible" show, that the stamp might self-destruct in <br/>
five seconds! Anyone have any suggestions for helping to change their <br/>
attitudes regarding this?  <br/>
<br/>
   At any rate, at this time, we box as a family of six..."Cap'n <br/>
Rasha and my Scurvy Crew of Misfits", though once we finish the boxes <br/>
in our area (Central Coast of California) we may rethink that and <br/>
just start going out as a couple!  We also take our toy Pomeranian <br/>
with us ("Sir Grog Dogee of Pomerania"!)and though he is not very big <br/>
and scary to deter anyone, he does bark and stays more alert of our <br/>
surroundings than we tend to and that is good to always have that <br/>
warning system to rely on...though we are careful when out anyway, as <br/>
its not about just protecting us as adults, but we have to protect <br/>
four kids as well.  And though I can run pretty fast, I am not so <br/>
sure the kids can!  So we stop when it starts getting dark and don't <br/>
go to areas that we think might be a dangerous situation. <br/>
<br/>
New to Letterboxing, but I already have a few tips to add....<br/>
<br/>
Tip One:   Take a cell phone if you have one.  We rarely remember to <br/>
take the cell phone, probably because we are wanting to get away from <br/>
all of that!  But I do think that its a good idea to have one...it <br/>
can be turned off of course, so the outside world won't bug you while <br/>
you are out enjoying nature, but you'd have the security of knowing <br/>
that you have it with you in case of emergency.<br/>
<br/>
Tip Two:   My biggest suggestion is this, even if you "think" you <br/>
will only be out for half an hour or so....TAKE WATER WITH YOU!  We <br/>
have run into too many instances where we needed water, either for <br/>
thirsty kids or the dog, or to clean something or someone off, and <br/>
have not had any, thinking that we would just go out for a half hour <br/>
run and then come home.  But things never really work out that way!  <br/>
Bringing a snack along, or even a makeshift picnic, is nice too.<br/>
<br/>
Tip Three:  Bring hand wipes or hand sanitizer.  Someone always gets <br/>
messy retrieving boxes, or on rare occasions, steps in something!<br/>
<br/>
Tip Four: Bring a camera!  There are many opportunities for great <br/>
photos along the way.  Remember, it's not the destination, it's the <br/>
journey! *Smiles*  Also, if you want to photograph a hiding spot, it <br/>
is fun to get candid photos of everyone stamping in, just please <br/>
don't post the pictures showing the hiding spots to the group's <br/>
website as that sort of goes against the "Code of Conduct" for <br/>
letterboxers, that one doesn't tell others how or where to find the <br/>
box. If a picture shows the location, that sort of defeats the <br/>
purpose. *Smiles*<br/>
<br/>
Tip Five:  For convenience, get a "fanny pack" or get everyone one.  <br/>
They are lighter and less cumbersome than a backpack, they allow you <br/>
easy access and you don't have to take them on and off in able to <br/>
reach what you need.  Your stamp, log book, pens or stamp pad, a <br/>
granola bar or other small snack, a small disposable camera and <br/>
travel size hand sanitizer fit nicely into one. Some even have a <br/>
section that holds a bottle of water. You can rig gloves to it with a <br/>
clip and with the fanny pack, a hiking stick, and good shoes you are <br/>
ready to go!<br/>
<br/>
Tip Six:  Put on sunscreen before going out and bring along some sort <br/>
of small first aid kit.  Doesn't have to be elaborate as you are <br/>
usually not that far away from your car or civilization. But bring <br/>
bandaids, sanitizer, perhaps antibiotic ointment, bee sting anti-<br/>
venom if you have someone that is allergic to bees and such, inhalers <br/>
for those with asthma--as you will likely be out stirring up dust or <br/>
hiking around plants that can cause an asthma attack ( I learned the <br/>
hard way not to leave mine in the car!) Bring along any first aid <br/>
items you think you might need, including something for headache <br/>
relief if you are boxing with children! ;) Also, it's a great idea to <br/>
either spray bug repellant before you go out, or bring some with you.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
PS---I had another thought, carrying a small pocketknife in your <br/>
fanny pack is a good idea also, and one could learn to use their <br/>
hiking stick as a staff weapon! *Smiles*<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you are hiking alone, or even with others, it is especially <br/>
important to have a license or other form of ID and emergency contact <br/>
numbers with you in case something should befall you.  If for some <br/>
reason, (*knocks on wood*) you should be found unconscious along the <br/>
trail, someone finding you would at least know who you are and who to <br/>
contact in an emergency.<br/>

I often hike and LB alone. You never know in New England when the weather is going to draw you out of the house and into the woods at a moments notice! Many of the LBs up here are hidden on trails that are rocky, steep, isolated, or are a long distance. I do take some precautions. I always file a "flight plan" with my husband of which trails I plan (or may) visit during my outing. If he doesn't hear from me by a certain time, he should call the "rangers" to check of the parking lots at these trails for my Jeep and when they find it, come look for me. I usually carry my cell phone, but there are many places where there is no service. Just for emergencies I carry Pepper Spray on my backpack which you can buy (at least in CT) at postal uniform shops. That was a suggestion of the folks at Eastern MT. Sports; it will take down a bear as well as someone whose intentions aren't admirable! The most important item is water - more than you think you may require! I always carry extra high-energy snacks (beef jerky, nuts, trail mix, can of sardines, fruit, etc) just in case I get stranded for awhile. Also, I carry some emergency equipment, a foil heat blanket that can be used as a reflector, a rain poncho, first aid kit including moleskin for blisters, extra socks, a whistle, a compass and a small high-intensity flashlight. Amazingly, all this fits easily into my small hydration backpack - along with my LB necessities. On winter hikes or especially long hikes, I carry a little extra of everything. If my lab is with me, I carry a small folding hand trowel to bury any gifts he chooses to leave behind. Another thing is consider is changing weather. It's always a good idea to layer your clothes so you can remove or add them as needed. If you go into a great sports store like REI or EMS, you will find many high-tech little gems that are lightweight &amp; small for a small pack (like teeny tiny bright little flashlights). <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a couple of comments on your tips:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tip One:   Take a cell phone if you have one.  <br/>
 Don't rely on it.  All too often you won't have service in the woods.<br/>
Instead, use common sense and safe hiking (a whistle for example is much<br/>
more reliable than my cell if I need to summon help)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tip Three:  Bring hand wipes or hand sanitizer.  Someone always gets<br/>
&gt; messy retrieving boxes, or on rare occasions, steps in something!<br/>
Don't foget, even the unscented wipes have an odor that may be attractive to<br/>
woodland critters.  Instead, carry a baggie of wet paper towels and save the<br/>
wipes/sanitizers for when the hike is over!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Tip Four: Bring a camera!  <br/>
Definitely!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
In general, common sense goes a long way--that and respect!<br/>
<br/>
Nice summary of tips...many of which I learned the hard way, lol!<br/>
