  First your redwall series are my daughters favorite boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  second, We love to look through the logbooks to see who we recognize. It's <br/>
also exciting to see new names and stamps.  It's part of the treasure in <br/>
away.   But as the owner I too would want to collect my logbooks. I think <br/>
you should  replace full books or ones that are falling apart. We stamped in <br/>
chongs candy box and  I was wishing we had a rubberband or something to keep <br/>
it  together, so I'm glad you rescued it.<br/>
<br/>
third: We are looking forward to meeting you and hopefully several other <br/>
names from our boxing adventures next month at the SLO gathering.<br/>

Yes, I think, after consideration, that is what I plan to do.  Thanks.<br/>

Me too - I can hardly wait.  ALSO, three days from now on Monday, I <br/>
plan to get my 100th find, and if everything works out I am hoping it <br/>
will be Scabbers the Rat in Morro Bay.  How nice that there is a new <br/>
rodent out there for me to find, even if it is an unsavory one!!  <br/>
Thanks so much for planting those, I am very excited to go find them.<br/>
