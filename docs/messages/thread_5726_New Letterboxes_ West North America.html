find the location of where the boxes are hidden you will need to<br/>
think like a Canadian, remember a little bit of history, and like<br/>
clues that beat around the bush. You may want to take gloves, as<br/>
there will be nettles about.<br/>
<br/>
Location Clues:<br/>
1. You need to be West of the Cascade Mountains.<br/>
2. Be on or near the historical division between the USA and Canada.<br/>
3. Where there is a meeting of two merging to the west. One is<br/>
smaller than the other<br/>
4. Get the point.<br/>
5. Dont step in _ _ _  _ _ _ _.<br/>
<br/>
Canadian Series #1  The Flag Easy<br/>
<br/>
Drive to the end of the road and Park. Once on the trail spot the 4th<br/>
door on the Jiffy. From the door walk straight ahead until you see a<br/>
path on the left. Head towards the water but be sure not to trip over<br/>
the first box in the process. <br/>

Canadian Series #2  Your Neighbours Easy<br/>
