                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's shocking, the number of e-mails I got about my off-the-cuff <br/>
comment about large ink pads being a "newbie mistake".  The <br/>
surprising thing (for me, at least!), is that it seems to be a <br/>
common "pro mistake" too with people asking me why one would want a <br/>
smaller ink pad size--even those that are well-established in the <br/>
world of letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
First, it's a trivial issue, which is why I never even bothered to <br/>
mention it on the Newbie FAQ page of my website.  One can live a very <br/>
happy letterboxing career without ever using an ink pad smaller than <br/>
the size of a small car.  It's not a very good page, I admit, but I <br/>
didn't have a digital camera or scanner available to add pictures <br/>
that could have made it easier to understand and follow along with.  <br/>
(Someday I *WILL* update it with lots and lots of pictures, though!)<br/>
<br/>
But there are advantages to using smaller ink pads--especially if you <br/>
like to stamp with lots of colors.  I do have a webpage, Stamping <br/>
With Style, at http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/Stamping that <br/>
discusses several stamping techniques where smaller ink pads are <br/>
easier to work with.<br/>
<br/>
But there's also other reasons I like small ink pads.  They're small <br/>
and lightweight--a critical factor if you ever decide to do something <br/>
like, perhaps, thru-hike the Appalachian Trail.  =)  Okay, not a <br/>
factor most of you have to consider, but there is something to be <br/>
said for smaller and lighter regardless of the length of the hike.<br/>
<br/>
And with smaller ink pads, you can carry a wider variety of colors to <br/>
really make that stamp come out perfect and color coordinated.<br/>
<br/>
But I know more than one very experienced letterboxer that's happy <br/>
with carrying around a single color and using that for everything.  <br/>
(Even those that know about the alternatives.)  If you like carrying <br/>
around just one, simple color, by all means--do so!  I wasn't trying <br/>
to talk anyone out of it!  =)<br/>
<br/>
But just like there's an art to carving a stamp, there's also an art <br/>
to stamping one.  The beauty of this hobby is that you can take it as <br/>
far as YOU want to.  Carpe diem!  =)<br/>

<br/>
I couldn't agree more. As a matter of fact, I've quit using ink pads<br/>
altogether. I carry around a zippered pouch full of crayola markers.<br/>
It is lightweight, organized, and lets me choose from a rainbow of<br/>
colors. Plus, by painting the colors onto the stamp, I avoid the<br/>
gunked residue of ink from an ink pad and never have the problem of<br/>
over-inking the stamp. <br/>
Of course, everyone has their own way of doing things. Just thought I<br/>
share mine. If you would like to see the crayola pack I use, go to <br/>

The ink we were using 'stained' the stamps we were carving when we did our test prints and I really didn't like that.  Then we get the washable makers and away we went!  However, I do see a downside to this in the fact that I am sure that the color will run in a logbook when it gets wet.  I do like the ability to use multiple colors on a stamp though, the World Reunion Tour stamp we made looks so kewl when colored in 3 colors instead of one and we are also able to get a more even coverage with the washable pens.  Plus, the weight of them is insignificant in the back pack.<br/>

  Do you have any problems with the old ink that is already on the stamp, coming off onto your marker and discoloring the image you were trying to get?<br/>
<br/>
  If you clean the stamp first what is the best method you've found?  <br/>
<br/>
  I found a letterbox with a marker in it.  I thought it was a bit odd (being a newbie and all) but I liked how it turned out just fine.<br/>

AS a long time rubber stamper, I use baby wipes. They are easy to <br/>
carry and do an excellent job. They do not tend ot dry out the <br/>
stamps. Purple Iris<br/>
