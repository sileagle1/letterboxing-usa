Polk County, Oregon<br/>
Placed by Funhog 3/03<br/>
This box is part of the 45th Parallel Series, an attempt to place letterboxes all along the mysterious <br/>
invisible line which runs around the earth half-way between the North Pole and the Equator.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: From Salem head west on Highway 22. A little over ten miles after the junction with <br/>
99W you will cross Mill Creek. Take the next left on Mill Creek Rd. In about a mile start watching to <br/>
the left for a blue roof. Along the edge of the tilled field next door you will find the orange Witness <br/>
Post marking the 45th Parallel. From the survey marker, travel .3 miles farther down the road where <br/>
you will see a lineup of retired farm workers. They have creaky joints and flat feet. Pick the one who <br/>
looks like he'd be fun at a party. This guy mixes well and will open the doors to his heart for you. He <br/>
keeps everything above the belt and safeguards the letterbox.<br/>
