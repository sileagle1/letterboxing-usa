far. And most are easy enough that I can enjoy them on my lunch hour. Plus they are in <br/>
cool local areas I would never have seen and I have emailed her the wonderful photos I <br/>
take of these areas. I have only planted one box, but I put it out here and emailed her, so <br/>
she would "have something to do" LOL<br/>
<br/>
She went out the next day, even with a cold and found it. Thus far she is the only one. :-)<br/>

&gt; I had found everything in my particular area, but there are 3-4 new boxers here now, <br/>
and they are putting in some great new boxes.  I even found a whole new section in my <br/>
favorite park that I had never been in thanks to one of them!<br/>

I was curious that you said you have planted one box and only one person so<br/>
far has gone to find it.  So I went to letterboxing.org and to AQ to try to<br/>
find your clues, but nothing in your name came up..... can you direct me to<br/>
the box clues?<br/>

and this is a holiday week when not that many people might be out boxing.<br/>
Being one of the gourmet cooks in the family, I know I've been stuck pretty<br/>
close to the kitchen yesterday and today.  :-)  Plus I've been trying to<br/>
bond two mini-lop bunnies to see if they can become friends -- this is also<br/>
a big time of year to dump unwanted animals at shelters and animal<br/>
controls -- both these bunnies were recently dumped.  A lot of folks are<br/>
also lining up their Black Friday moves since BF starts at midnight this<br/>
year so there's more planning needed!<br/>
<br/>
I think once Thanksgiving is over and Black Friday is over there might be a<br/>
lot more boxers out there to salvage the rest of the weekend for boxing.<br/>
The weather is supposed to be rain tho in the Chicago area.  I had hopes to<br/>
do me some powerboxing!  5 boxes!  One Friday, one Saturday, one Sunday, one<br/>
Monday, and one Tuesday.  :-) For me, that's powerboxing!<br/>
