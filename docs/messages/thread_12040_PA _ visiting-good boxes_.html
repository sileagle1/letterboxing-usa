There's not many letterboxes in the south-central part of the state just <br/>
yet. I have one near Hanover (the Mary Ann Furnace box), which is 14 miles <br/>
from Gettysburg, and the Drakes have a number in Cumberland County around <br/>
Carlisle, which is about 45 minutes northwest from Gettysburg. (I have <br/>
another box carved and ready to be planted in York County but haven't been <br/>
down that way to plant it just yet.)<br/>
<br/>
There are bunches and bunches of boxes in Frederick, Washington and Carroll <br/>
counties in MD, which are a bit further south. I bet pychomommy and the AD <br/>
gang can give you some tips on which boxes might be closest to Gettysburg.<br/>
<br/>
In the Allentown area, you'll have more to choose from. Besides the boxes <br/>
in Lehigh County in the Allentown environs, there are a number in <br/>
Northampton county just to the east. (I think the "Just Flying Through" box <br/>
in Allentown was reported MIA, perhaps someone can confirm.)<br/>
<br/>
In between Allentown &amp; Gettysburg, there's the "Bridges of Lancaster" <br/>
letterbox in Lancaster county, which might make an interesting side trip <br/>
off the highway and on the local roads. Just watch out for the buggies! <br/>
There are some boxes in Lebanon and  Berks county, too, but I haven't found <br/>
too many of those just yet.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when you're checking out quilt shops in the Gettysburg area, maybe <br/>
you can drop by the Quilt Patch in Littlestown <br/>
(http://www.quiltpatchshoppes.com/) and say hello to my mom who works there <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As said there aren't too many in the immediate area,, but if you get <br/>
to the Reading and French Creek State Park (Berks County) area there <br/>
are a lot kinda bunched togeter Reading is about 25 minutes southish <br/>
of Allentown and French Creek is about 15 further, Also there are a <br/>
few in Bucks county that are within 40 min or less from Allentown. <br/>
Too many to list I'd say look at the LBNA site and get a Map out, <br/>
lol. I haven't gone on a bad one in the area yet! Also I believe it <br/>
was MapSurfer that put together a nice one in Valley Forge National <br/>
Park.. since hubby is into the war stuff, be it that Valley Forge <br/>
wasn't the civil war, still might coax him into it. :) Happy <br/>
hunting, and good luck :)<br/>
