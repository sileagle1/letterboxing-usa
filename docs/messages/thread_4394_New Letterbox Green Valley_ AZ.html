                    <div class="plaintext-content">On February 5, 2002 Funhog placed the Madera Canyon letterbox near the town<br/>
of Green Valley, Pima County, Arizona. Madera Canyon is a mountainous,<br/>
green respite from the flat Sonoran desert. Bird watchers from the world<br/>
over visit this area. At the Santa Rita Lodge there are numerous bird<br/>
feeders and is a wonderful place to relax, sitting on a bench, gazing at<br/>
the numerous visitors both human and avian. There are no places to buy food<br/>
in the canyon. So, bring a lunch and spend a tranquil afternoon amongst the<br/>
Oaks and Sycamores.<br/>
To the trailhead: Go south from Tucson on I-19 to exit 63. From here go 1.1<br/>
miles east to Whitehouse Rd. Turn right and drive to the end of the road.<br/>
You will be at the Roundup Picnic Area and Nature Trail. The trail begins<br/>
at the lowest parking lot.<br/>
To the letterbox: Tread on concrete listening to the gentle whisper to your<br/>
right until it is no more. Keep on the trail until you are invited to take<br/>
a seat. Thirty-eight steps beyond this point you will see a rock to the<br/>
right leaning against a tree. Peek beneath.<br/>
