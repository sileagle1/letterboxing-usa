                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was in AK in mid June and asked the same question.  Mostly I heard that the boxes in Anchorage area were not where they said they were.  I did 1 box while in AK and it was in Hope on the Resurrection Trail which is about 30 muntues outside of Anchorage in Hope.  If you can go that far I will tell you how to get there.  The driving directions were incorrect, but once you get on the trail, the directions were correct.  Please contact me and I can help you if you want to get this box in Hope.<br/>
