<br/>
The park rangers were incredibly nice. They said that they didn't mind the letterboxes, and thought they were a neat idea. They want us to stay on the trail with the boxes. As an example, my Guardhouse letterbox, which was hidden behind a cement pillar, but accessible without steppng off the trail, was perfect. Anything further off the trail than that was a no-no. <br/>
<br/>
They have had problems with geocachers in other parks in the area, so if you are a geocacher, please Leave No Trace and make sure your visitors do the same... they were displeased with the person who stepped of a cliff while staring at his GPS receiver and require helicopter rescue. That is not the way to endear oneself to government officials. (: Please stay on the trails and do not dig up anything. They thought it was neat, though. I think they would just prefer to help hide it, so if you want to do one in the park, PLEASE go talk to the rangers about how you can do it in way that will benefit visitors and the park. <br/>
<br/>
I filled out a form, naming the group "Letterboxing North America" and they made me put myself as the group leader... I explained that we don't have a leader... that trying organize letterboxers is like herding cats (which made them laugh). <br/>
<br/>
What they want are these things:<br/>
<br/>
1. To know where the boxes are before the clues are posted. <br/>
2. For people to follow park rules (one example was a logbook indicated someone had been there at night, all Washington State Parks close at dusk). <br/>
3. Stay on the trails. <br/>
4. Post links to the state park rules &amp; regulations, and the letterboxing guidelines (which are basically "Respect the environment and stay on the trail." but they may formalize something later) on the page, very visibly, with the clues. <br/>
<br/>
The guy I talked to preferred that the clues for Fort Worden boxes be kept on my web site, since I am able to update it almost instantly (I explained that the LBNA webmasters are volunteers and that they just don't have the time to do changes at the drop of a hat). <br/>
<br/>
The Special Activities Permit will be mailed to me, pending approval. They were sure it would be approved, though. I think it had to go through their boss, the head ranger at the park, and someone else. They just want everyone to see it so that they'll know what the letterboxes are, I think. <br/>
<br/>
It was $10, which I thought was a pretty good deal. (:  I am not sure if this covers everyone in the park, but if you want to plant a box there, I strongly suggest you drop in to the park office and visit with the park rangers. They were very nice, very friendly, and just about everything a government official should be but usually isn't. <br/>
<br/>
Amanda, they had two of your boxes, and said that the Memory's Vault box was missing. They said they would like you to come in to retrieve them. I think that if you call and talk to them, they might release the boxes to me (then I could return them to you or replant them in a sanctioned spot if you wish). They didn't want to return them without actually telling you to stay on the trail and that they are concerned about the environment. They wouldn't accept me explaining it. (: Also, I think they were expecting someone big and mean but got me instead. (:  <br/>
<br/>
They said they were concerned about vandalism, and I explained that mostly letterboxers are pretty mild. We go find the box, we stamp in, we go home... (:  He said that if they were all like me, they had nothing to worry about. I grew up with that park as my back yard, and probably know the park better than they do. <br/>
<br/>
The one guy wanted us to post the regulations for letterboxing in the park on my web site. I said that would be fine, just send me a copy of them and I would do so immediately. <br/>
<br/>
I told him about how we have letterboxes in several state parks and that they have been well-received and generally follow the Leave No Trace example. <br/>
<br/>
i will definitely be putting lots of boxes there just because they were so nice to me and seemed happy to have us all tromping along the trails, enjoying the park. <br/>
<br/>
They also encouraged me to mention the junior ranger stamp program -- so I will find out more about it and put that on my web site. If kids/families collect trash on your hike, haul it out, and then go to the park office, you can get a stamp in a passport and after 10 stamps you've earned a free night of camping. I think that's fab. (:  <br/>
<br/>
I haven't replanted my boxes yet, though I have them back. I will carve a few more and put them there... for those of you who can but haven't yet made the trip to Port Townsend, it is well worth it. The park is fabulous. There's a beach, a place to fly kites, tons of trails, camping sites, and of course all the old Army post bunkers, etc. along with the wonderful historical aspect. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to see the REAL guardhouse, go ask at the park office how to get to it. you can drive right up to it, it's by the mule barn. (Not really a place for mules, though... used to be...) <br/>

awesome park, there is a Youth Hostel on Ft Worden, too--so, if <br/>
you're looking for inexpensive, non-tent/sleeping bag camping, <br/>
that's always a possibility.  Check out Hosteling International--<br/>
