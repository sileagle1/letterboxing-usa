I went out to visit an old friend that I had found before - Bonsai.  <br/>
The Maplines were there just before me and can testify to the <br/>
condition of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Suffice to say, after I re-found it today, I put it in a brand new <br/>
watertight container, dried out the wet logbook as best as possible <br/>
(many stamp images have been lost), put it in a new ziplock baggie, <br/>
put the stamp in a separate ziplock baggie, and put both smaller <br/>
baggies into one big one.  The standard issue "What is Letterboxing" <br/>
sheet was really moldy, so I removed it.<br/>
<br/>
Would the next person who goes out to box Bonsai please bring the <br/>
standard issue "What is Letterboxing" page for the box, as well as a <br/>
black inkpad.  Currently there is no inkpad for this box.  I can only <br/>
carry so many emergency supplies in my pack at one time!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Do you want me to adopt this one?  I don't know how to get in touch <br/>
with the placer, and it obviously isn't being maintained.  It's close <br/>
to me, so it wouldn't be a hassle.<br/>

I have officially been named the "maintainer" by the webmaster.  I <br/>
will add it to the list of letterboxes that I have adopted and will <br/>
keep it in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
It is now clean and relatively dry, properly packaged, and I'll scoot <br/>
out and add a black inkpad to it.<br/>
