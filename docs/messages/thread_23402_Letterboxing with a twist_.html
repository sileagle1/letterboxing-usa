<br/>
I have been an advocate of letterboxing but not a great doer. I have <br/>
taken my nieces and my hubby and I have been a couple of times. BUT<br/>
I can now combine letterboxing with my hubby's passion for running <br/>
marathons.He is going for 50 marathons in 50 states.Well,his last two <br/>
marathons were held in exact places as some amazing letterboxes.<br/>
Holyoke Ma at Mountain Park and Carrabassett Valley Maine. I am kinda <br/>
the one who organizes his runs so I will look for marathons where <br/>
there are letterboxes. LOL<br/>
I just wish I knew what roads we would be taking home. We tend to <br/>
drive on back roads with interesting names and use the sun to <br/>
navagate direction.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to work thru a process where I can leave boxes but I am <br/>
aware that I don't want them to be orphans and am still mulling that <br/>
over. Of course it took me forever to find this list. DUH!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh he is Zippy and I am DancingStar. LOL<br/>
