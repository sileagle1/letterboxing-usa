<br/>
Message:<br/>
While geocaching recently I came across a letterbox in Arroyo <br/>
Grande. Being new to geocaching, I didn't realize this was an <br/>
entirely different game. The stamp (which the box said not to <br/>
remove) was missing. So I figured ALL the stuff that <br/>
had been there was plundered. Being the good citizen I am ;) I <br/>
refilled the LETTERBOX with GEOCACHE trinkets! (I'm turning red.)<br/>
<br/>
ANYHOW...can't find any mention of an Arroyo Grande letterbox on <br/>
this site. Any suggestions for how I might find its owner to let <br/>
him/her know the stamp is missing...and that I will return shortly <br/>
to remove my detritus. (I suspect another geocacher found the <br/>
letterbox, too, and, as with the "rules" of geocaching, <br/>
traded a trinket for the stamp.)<br/>

==============================================================<br/>
I wrote her back asking exactly where she found the letterbox. <br/>
Probably get the GPS coordinates back. Seems most of them can read <br/>
that. At least she wrote me asking if it was my box. Perhaps we can <br/>
save her from geocaching; seems like she has a good heart. Wonder if <br/>
she cheeseraces, though?<br/>

I do understand that. The problem is that the Geocachers do not seem <br/>
to read that label either.<br/>
