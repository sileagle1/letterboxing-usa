Has their ever been thought to different LB email lists?  For example,<br/>
one that is just for new clues and status reports on existing boxes.<br/>
I'm this close to unsubscribing to the list again, not because the<br/>
conversation isn't worthwhile, but because their is too much volume.  It<br/>
isn't worth my while to sift through hundreds of emails looking for<br/>
status reports or new boxes in my area.  Just my $.02 worth.<br/>

I'm contemplating that as well.  Unfortunately, quite a few talented <br/>
folks have already done so.<br/>
Depending on what part of the country you're in, yes, there are <br/>
alternative forums available to you.  Some of these groups are quite <br/>
specialized, ie female artists, fed-up old-timers, lesbian whale-<br/>
watching letterboxers, etc.  Inquire locally.<br/>

I have my letterbox-usa membership set to "no email", and read the <br/>
messages online on the Yahoo!Groups page.  That way I can choose <br/>
what to read/not read, depending on my interest level. letterbox-usa <br/>
page, under "Edit My Membership", you have the option of editing <br/>
your message settings.  Online reading is a good option for me, <br/>
because I can scroll through the messages easily and only open the <br/>
ones I want to.   Makes for much less mail in the inbox, also!<br/>

There IS a second group list for announcing new boxes posted to the <br/>
LBNA site. You could shut this one off and the other on. Directions <br/>
are somewhere on the site; I'm about to run out the door, or I'd <br/>
hunt them up for you.<br/>

&gt; This is an old topic, but one, I feel,that is worth repeating.  If <br/>
folks would preface their post with the two letter abbreviation for <br/>
the state they're referring to in their posts, it makes it much esier <br/>
to weed through the volumes. --Happy Boxing- Sunshine :0)<br/>

mail" and check the list online, or set it to "daily digest" and get <br/>
one or two emails per day with a consolidation of the messages.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few regional lists, and specialized lists for people that <br/>
share other interests, etc.  I know the regional lists include one <br/>
for Southern California, Pacific Northwest, and one for the Rocky <br/>
Mountain area, too.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested - just ask here if there's one for the part of <br/>
the country you're in.<br/>
<br/>
There's also an email list for hitchhikers, and one JUST to announce <br/>
new boxes (I have that one set to digest, so I can quick at a glance <br/>
see if any are in my state).<br/>
<br/>
Just helping!<br/>
