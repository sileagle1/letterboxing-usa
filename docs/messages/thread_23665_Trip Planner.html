<br/>
I'm a newbie here...signed up because the letterboxing.org site is not <br/>
working.<br/>
<br/>
We're traveling at the end of this week from Indianapolis to Wichita.  <br/>
Does anyone have clues for letterboxes they can email to me?  We don't <br/>
have a lot of time to meander far from I-70, maybe a detour thru Lake <br/>
of the Ozarks if we're ahead of schedule.<br/>
<br/>
I did find some clues on atlasquest.com, but I was counting on being <br/>
able to look at letterboxing.org which seems to have more clues than <br/>
any other site.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
I-70 runs through Columbia, between St Louis and Kansas City, and the <br/>
last time I counted there were about 50 boxes here.  I can't e-mail <br/>
any clues to you, but I could make photocopies if you're interested.  <br/>
E-mail me off-line if you are.<br/>

What you can do is check out Atlasquest.com.  They have a trip planner <br/>
that you can use that will show all of the boxes along your route.  You <br/>
can even get specific and have it show you all of the boxes within a <br/>
certain distance from the highway.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the boxes listed there have the clues posted on <br/>
letterboxing.org.  Fortunatly, they have many of the clues cached, so <br/>
you can still get the clues.  Just click on the view cache button.<br/>
