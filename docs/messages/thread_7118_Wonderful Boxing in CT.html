                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent a lovely day letterboxing in Eastern CT today.  We found <br/>
Lake Wangumbaug, Uncle Sam's Nephew, Stars and Stripes(FINALLY), Red <br/>
bird, and Skungamaug River all in good shape in Coventry.  Some of <br/>
the glue on the inkpads have melted due to the heat, but they are <br/>
still useable, if messy.  We found Southeast School and Goodnight <br/>
Moon in Mansfield Center, though in less than perfect shape.  <br/>
Southeast School was missing it's logbook- people have been leaving <br/>
pages of their own books to stamp in.  Goodnight Moon was intact, but <br/>
quite damp.  We didn't have any extra baggies today, so we couldn't <br/>
replace it. Sorry.  We also found Uconn Huskies Mascot in Storrs in <br/>
great shape- great placement, Chuck, Molly, &amp; Chickabirdie.  Found a <br/>
little something extra there: a new hitchhiker named Paperclip!  We <br/>
will be placing him at a new location soon.  And last but not least, <br/>
we found Peace: thank you so much, Jay.  That was a terrific box.  10 <br/>
boxes in all; not a bad day.  Thanks to everyone who placed such <br/>
wonderfull boxes.<br/>
