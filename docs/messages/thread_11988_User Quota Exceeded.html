&gt;Grape Ape and I only had time for a quick box today (we were too busy being <br/>
&gt;lazy in the hot sunshine to do any more hiking in the woods that that). We <br/>
&gt;found the Legend of Pudding Lane letterbox after school (in good condition, <br/>
&gt;and right near some nice rocks to sit and stamp in on), and lo and behold -- <br/>
&gt;we found a hitchhiker!! I was sooo excited! We found the FFA at 75 HH, <br/>
&gt;originally planted by Leader of the Pack in PA, but conveniently returned <br/>
&gt;home to CT by Wanda and Pete. FFA will be back on the trails as soon as we <br/>
&gt;are! Enjoy the sunshine everyone!<br/>

&gt;I e-mailed Mr. Marketa months ago suggesting he look into writing a <br/>
&gt;letterboxing article as it draws so many of us to public parks and <br/>
&gt;places, while often providing interesting background info.  It's <br/>
&gt;great he chose to highlight the new  state forest commemorative <br/>
&gt;letterbox stamps!  I need to  start collecting this excellent series.<br/>

&gt;Too funny, Latte Man and Curious Crane!  I just got this email!  I wonder if you were out there checking on your box on the 13th when we were there. Did you read my reply to Mary Manatees report? My boyfriend, his cousin, and his friend were off exploring and making a lot of noise while I was trying to retrace our steps to find the right spot for Laurel. I was walking around looking verrrry closely at telephone poles when 2 people passed.  Did you see me there?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;When Betz and I went last year, we never found a wooden footbridge.  We crossed over on a very slippery and crumbly-barked fallen tree.  I thought that was your "bridge to nowhere."  I know we weren't the only ones to not find the bridge.  Nice box, though; pretty area and nice stamp.  I hope it gets more visitors now.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt;  The old wooden footbridge that lead to the letterbox has recently <br/>
&gt;  been removed. We saw it at another stream crossing, probably moved <br/>
&gt;  there by people who wanted to get 4-wheel ATVs across. The old bridge <br/>
&gt;  was kind of scary to cross anyway, so we are changing the clues a <br/>
&gt;  little bit to make the approach to the letterbox safer and easier, if <br/>
&gt;  less exciting. Driving and parking directions are the same as before.<br/>

&gt;Chaplin CT.                                              Rated Moderate<br/>
&gt;(Some Rocky Walking)     Placed By The NeeDeeps 4-15-03<br/>
&gt;Directions: From RT.6 turn onto Potter road.This will be the entrance to<br/>
&gt;Goodwin State Forest in Hampton CT.Follow the road a little ways and you<br/>
&gt;will come to 11th Section road which is a right turn.Travel down 11th<br/>
&gt;Section road 1.3 miles where the road turns sharply and there is a sign<br/>
&gt;that says Esterbrook RD. Take a left here onto a unmarked road,Travel<br/>
&gt;down .3 mile and you will see a pull off area on the right, park there.<br/>
&gt;You will also see trails on both sides of the road, cross the road and<br/>
&gt;take the White blazed trail left of a dirt road.( Don't forget the clues<br/>
&gt;for Black Spruce Pond and The Forgotten Wood Pile,for they are near by.)<br/>
&gt;Enter the trail and follow the white blazes for a while until you come<br/>
&gt;to a T in the trail.Take a right here and continue on you will come to a<br/>
&gt;intersection,take a right here onto the Blue blazed trail.(Do not go<br/>
&gt;straight across follow the blue trail on the right.) Follow the trail<br/>
&gt;down to the pond and you will see a Dam on your left,cross over and<br/>
&gt;follow the trail up a little hill their will be two trails to choose,<br/>
&gt;stay with the blue and follow around the pond.Once you round the pond<br/>
&gt;the trail will start getting rocky.The rocky trail will get better as<br/>
&gt;you go up a small hill,at the top on your left is a pile of rocks that<br/>
&gt;look like a fire place.Keep going a little more and the trail will get<br/>
&gt;rocky again,and then the rocks are gone.Twisting and turning with the<br/>
&gt;blue you will soon come to a T.Go right onto a wider trail and soon you<br/>
&gt;will come to a intersection with a dirt road,turn right here and follow<br/>
&gt;the dirt road.You will go up a small hill,when you almost get to the<br/>
&gt;top,you will see a rock ledge sticking out of the banking on your left<br/>
&gt;with a oak tree that splits into two sisters just before it.Behind that<br/>
&gt;is a stone wall,Behind that wall under some flat rocks is the Sucker<br/>
&gt;Fish Letterbox.From here you can continue on this dirt road and it will<br/>
&gt;bring you back to your car.A sucker fish is usually a type of carp fish<br/>
&gt;that feeds off the bottom of the pond.They spend a lot of time swimming<br/>
&gt;around this pond for nothing.Thats why they call them Suckers.The<br/>
&gt;NeeDeeps.    <br/>

&gt;PASSPORT TO THE FALLS LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Placed by: Hamish MacBeth, Cousin Knuepppe and Adam Ant. <br/>
&gt;Date: April 8th, 2003 <br/>
&gt;Number of Boxes: Two (other is "A BRIDGE TOO FINGERPRINTED") <br/>
&gt;City: Los Angeles <br/>
&gt;County: Los Angeles <br/>
&gt;State: California <br/>
&gt;Place: The Angeles National Forest Picnic Area - Switzer's (other is on the road.) <br/>
&gt;Terrain Difficulty: Easy <br/>
&gt;Status: Alive <br/>
&gt;Note: You do need a FOREST ADVENTURE PASS to park at Switzer Falls. Sorry about this - Cousin Knueppe has purchased a Pass (for $30 for the year, I believe. So if you have one - go for it!) <br/>
&gt;1.) Find the Angeles National Forest - I think you can take Highway 2 and you enter from the south-western entrance just off the 210. Check to be sure. <br/>
&gt;2.) See the 'Angeles National Forest Picnic Area - Switzer's' sign. Turn right, take the road all the way to the bottom. Park in the parking lot at the beginning of the creek. <br/>
&gt;3.) Walk toward the picnic bench, huge boulder and beyond is a foot bridge. Cross it. <br/>
&gt;4.) Take note of the signs and follow the trail for Switzer Falls. Keep going along the trail. FOLLOW THE CREEK. At the fork in the road, veer right. (Not toward the outhouse.) <br/>
&gt;5.) Keep in the path, there is poison ivy around. There is an opportunity to veer right, you may take this or continue straight - they will meet up. (If you want to be sure - KEEP FOLLOWING THE STREAM.) Go over the rocks. (At any time you can go back to the trail.) <br/>
&gt;6.) The path will eventually force you to cross the rocks. The stream forks - take the far one - so the stream is now on your left. There is a tree with a sign on it that says 'TRAIL' with an arrow. <br/>
&gt;7.) A little ways up is a small clearing on the right with a huge six trunked tree. Keep going. <br/>
&gt;8.) You'll have to cross the creek again so now it's on your right. Keep going. LANDMARKS: On your right will be a stone wall. Ahead are two trees. <br/>
&gt;9.) Cross the creek. On the right above is a tree with eight trunks - ahead of you in the middle of the road is a huge boulder. Climb up and stand in the middle of the tree, your back is to the creek. <br/>
&gt;10.) You'll see three of the trunks that form two paths. Take the left path. (Between the left trunk and middle.) You will see a big boulder on the right, a flat, blackish boulder in front of you and a couple above that. <br/>
&gt;11.) From the center of the tree, go about eight paces forward/up through left path. Now, look to your left - there are movable stones, the letterbox is behind them. (It's about 2-3 paces up and to the left.) Please be careful with the stones and put it back like you found it for the next Letterboxer! <br/>
&gt;Be discrete!! <br/>
&gt;Happy Hunting!! <br/>

<br/>
&gt;Placed by: Hamish MacBeth, Cousin Knuepppe and Adam Ant. <br/>
&gt;Date: April 8th, 2003 <br/>
&gt;Number of Boxes: Two (other is "PASSPORT TO THE FALLS") <br/>
&gt;City: Los Angeles <br/>
&gt;County: Los Angeles <br/>
&gt;State: California <br/>
&gt;Place: Angeles National Forest Bridge/Overpass (other is at Switzer Falls) <br/>
&gt;Terrain Difficulty: Easy <br/>
&gt;Status: Alive <br/>
&gt;1.) There is a tunnel right after a brown sign that says 'Bighorn Sheep Area Next 1 Mile' and a picture of binoculars. <br/>
&gt;2.) Pull over to the right and look at that mountanious view. Get out of the car and make your way to the bridge. <br/>
&gt;3.) Climb to behind/on top of the overpass, hugging the concrete wall for support. Go all the way to the end. <br/>
&gt;4.) There is a green bush - get behind it. (Careful if you go on the overpass to do so.) <br/>
&gt;5.) Face the double yellow line down on the road. In the bush, a tiny bit to the right is a plastic bag containing the letterbox under some rocks. (Careful of the sharp branches.) <br/>
&gt;6.) Please make sure you put a heavy rock back on it when you're through stamping up due to possible high winds. Yeah! Now enjoy that view!!! <br/>
&gt;Up here it's easy to be discrete!! <br/>
&gt;Happy Hunting!! <br/>

&gt;I've added a new feature to my Bike it or Hike it web page-MAPS! On <br/>
&gt;almost all of my letterboxes (still working on a few) you can now <br/>
&gt;click on a map of the bike/hike trail and print out a copy. If you <br/>
&gt;live near Uconn, in Storrs, CT, just go to the campus library and <br/>
&gt;copy services (first floor) and they can scan a map or picture for <br/>
&gt;you for only 50 cents. Just bring a floopy to download it too. FYI, <br/>
&gt;the Windsor Locks Canal trail in CT is now open for the summer. They <br/>
&gt;close from November 14-April 1 of each year. Also of interest, there <br/>
&gt;is a brand new bridge over the Farmington River in Farmington,CT on <br/>
&gt;the FVG Trail. Built over the old railroad trestle along the rail <br/>
&gt;trail. Looks as though they are getting ready to pave along this <br/>
&gt;section. See the FVG South Letterbox for directions. Visit www <br/>
&gt;geocities.com/haalck@snet net for the Bike it or Hike it web page.<br/>

&gt;The ADG is sad to report that the Lake Frank Firefly box is MIA.  We <br/>
&gt;have absolutely no doubt that we were at the correct spot, but the <br/>
&gt;box was not there.  We were at the first tree on the left as <br/>
&gt;described and there was indeed an obvious pile of rocks there but no <br/>
&gt;box.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;We did nab a first find on the Lake Frank Fungus!  I don't care how <br/>
&gt;many boxes you find, a first find is always a joy!  Sarah and I were <br/>
&gt;so anxious to get on the trail that we ran out of the office without <br/>
&gt;proper footwear and some crappy old foam Valentine's day stamps.  <br/>
&gt;The trail was beckoning so we made due but I recommend solid <br/>
&gt;footwear if you venture for this box.  The hike is not difficult or <br/>
&gt;particularly long but there is some rough footing involved.  Thanks <br/>
&gt;to Deb for the box and welcome to the game!  If you want to make <br/>
&gt;lifelong friends, hide some boxes in the Frederick area!  (hint, <br/>
&gt;hint, is anyone else reading this?)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;We also found the Lake Frank Turtle which was recently replaced by <br/>
&gt;the Forest Frog family.  Our apologies to Squirrel for sitting on <br/>
&gt;this replacement box so long and thanks to the Frogs for replacing <br/>
&gt;it for us.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;So if you haven't started boxing again yet, get your butts out <br/>
&gt;there!  I am sore and pretty pooped but I couldn't be happier about <br/>
&gt;it!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;BOX ON!<br/>

&gt;Name of letterbox:  Prairie Rose<br/>
&gt;My name: P. Granola (p2jd@aol.com)<br/>
&gt;Date Placed: 4-13-03<br/>
&gt;Placed in honor of the restored prairie effort at Willowbrook <br/>
&gt;Wildlife Center<br/>
&gt;Difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt;State: Illinois<br/>
&gt;County: Dupage<br/>
&gt;City:  Glen Ellyn<br/>
&gt;Location:  Willowbrook Wildlife Center<br/>
&gt;Directions: A few Miles West of 355 on Roosevelt Rd (route 38). Take <br/>
&gt;Roosevelt road to Park Blvd.  Turn South onto Park Blvd., travel <br/>
&gt;about 3 miles.  Willowbrook Wildlife Center is located on the West <br/>
&gt;side of the street; there is a brown sign at the entrance. <br/>
&gt;History:  The Willowbrook Wildlife Center is a part of the DuPage <br/>
&gt;County Forest Preserve District.  Primarily it is a center for the <br/>
&gt;care and rehabilitation of injured wildlife.  There are indoor and <br/>
&gt;outdoor displays of animals that are too damaged to be released into <br/>
&gt;the wild but well enough not to be euthanized. The center is a great <br/>
&gt;family attraction.  Make sure you visit indoors and then look around <br/>
&gt;outside at the Koi pond, prairie garden and wild animals.<br/>
&gt;Behind the nature center there are hiking trails that take the <br/>
&gt;visitor through a variety of ecosystems (deciduous forest, savannah, <br/>
&gt;pond &amp; prairie) <br/>
&gt;Clues: After you have toured the center and wandered around outside, <br/>
&gt;make your way to the path that reads "nature trails" (It's located <br/>
&gt;between the red tailed hawks and passenger pigeons cages).  If you <br/>
&gt;would like you can take a trail map out of the mailbox located to the <br/>
&gt;right.  (Just make sure to put the map back when you are done.)  <br/>
&gt;Cross the bridge and you will come to a fork in the road.  Turn left <br/>
&gt;and begin walking.  The DuPage River will be on your left and the <br/>
&gt;savannah will be on your right. Continue walking and be sure to read <br/>
&gt;the interpretive signs along the way.  You will walk in a loop, as <br/>
&gt;you travel the savannah will turn into prairie.  Read the signs <br/>
&gt;carefully.  When you see the sign that says" Restoration and <br/>
&gt;Management" you will want to stop. In front of the sign there will be <br/>
&gt;beautiful prairie, if you look to your left you will see Muskrat <br/>
&gt;Pond.  You will want to look to your right and retrace your steps by <br/>
&gt;about twenty paces.  There will be a tiny path on your right that you <br/>
&gt;can take.  You will see a bench, you might want to stop and rest for <br/>
&gt;a while!  From the end of the bench you will continue to walk about <br/>
&gt;20 paces. Stop and look to your left, (if you pass the two stands of <br/>
&gt;trees with the woodpile in between them you have gone too far.) Now <br/>
&gt;look into the woods on your left, start walking, and look for the <br/>
&gt;tree whose roots look like a spider.  Walk over the three thick roots <br/>
&gt;and stop.  If you have a compass you will want to look about 60 <br/>
&gt;degrees NE. (If you don't have a compass look ahead and slightly to <br/>
&gt;the right.)  You will see a large tree with a smaller one that has <br/>
&gt;fallen over next to it.  The smaller tree looks like a bent elbow. <br/>
&gt;Travel to those trees and look for the Prairie Rose box.  Happy <br/>
&gt;hunting!!<br/>
&gt;Caution: Watch out! There is poison ivy in the woods but none noted <br/>
&gt;where the box was placed<br/>

&gt;Here's a new Idaho letterbox-with more to come<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Placed by: Cadenza<br/>
&gt;Date: April 12, 2003<br/>
&gt;Location: Swan Valley, Idaho<br/>
&gt;Difficulty: easy<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Swan Valley is a beautiful little drive, midway between Idaho Falls, ID and<br/>
&gt;Jackson Hole, WY.  Keep your eyes out for wildlife, as it is abundant. This<br/>
&gt;is also big fishing country, so bring a rod. If you are coming in from the<br/>
&gt;Idaho side you will also get a nice view of miles and miles of those famous<br/>
&gt;potato fields.  If you want to be true to the area-local custom dictates<br/>
&gt;that everyone stops for a square ice cream cone at the Rainey Creek gas<br/>
&gt;station (3.5 miles past the letterbox spot on Hwy 26).  If you want to be<br/>
&gt;really true to the area, try the huckleberry-my favorite.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;From Idaho Falls follow highway 26.  You will reach your turnoff spot in<br/>
&gt;about 30 minutes.  Just before the road goes over the Snake River, you will<br/>
&gt;see a sign that points to Falls Creek Road and Campground.  Turn right on<br/>
&gt;that dirt road.  (The road is actually called Snake River Road, but the sign<br/>
&gt;for Falls Creek Road is easier to spot from the highway.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;1.3 miles up the dirt road, you will pass a turnoff, then go over a small<br/>
&gt;bridge with a wooden fence next to it.  As soon as you pass the creek, there<br/>
&gt;is a pulloff area you can park a car in-pass it and go to the next pulloff<br/>
&gt;(right after it, on the left side of the road).  Park there and go up to the<br/>
&gt;two posts in a V shape.  Starting at the two posts, walk 66 paces (1 step)<br/>
&gt;down the road in the direction you had been driving, staying on the left<br/>
&gt;side of the road.  On your left is a ditch/trail, follow it down (just a few<br/>
&gt;feet). The trail comes onto the top of a rock ledge from which you get a<br/>
&gt;nice view of a waterfall going into the Snake.  The trail then forms<br/>
&gt;naturally into three or four stone "steps."  At the bottom of these steps,<br/>
&gt;on the left side, the rock juts out some, with space underneath it.  Hedged<br/>
&gt;in that space, with loose rocks in front of it, you will find your reward.<br/>
&gt;Please be sure to replace the rocks too, so it won't be visible and hedge it<br/>
&gt;in tight, so that rains won't wash it out if it storms.  Hope you enjoy the<br/>
&gt;waterfall and the valley! <br/>

&gt;Hey Guru....I found the email address of the person who placed the <br/>
&gt;Whisper letterbox in Smithtown NY.  I last corresponded with him in <br/>
&gt;January, 2001, so I can't guarantee the email address is still <br/>

<br/>
&gt;As I told you, I'd love to help you out with your event in my <br/>

&gt;After nine months of letterboxing in MI, IL, OH, PA, NJ and DE, I <br/>
&gt;have finally gotten an exchange!  Actually two exchanges, two days in <br/>
&gt;a row!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Sunday while at Saugatuck Dunes checking "Old Man Winter" and <br/>
&gt;placing "Spring Fling," I came upon an elderly woman standing alone <br/>
&gt;next the trail, looking anxiously from one side to the other.  I <br/>
&gt;remembered passing her earlier on the trail and she had not been <br/>
&gt;alone.  Since she happened to be standing at the precise spot where <br/>
&gt;one would enter the woods in pursuit of another letterbox at this <br/>
&gt;park, I glanced into the woods, and sure enough there was the rest of <br/>
&gt;her party stamping into the box!  It was a first all-around, as Dave, <br/>
&gt;Lydia, Scott and Kristen (and guard Oma) were not only stamping into <br/>
&gt;the "First Letterbox on the Lake" (by Rainbow's End), but it was <br/>
&gt;their first ever letterbox find, and an exchange first for all of <br/>
&gt;us!  So welcome to these newbies from West Michigan!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Still on the high of actually meeting other letterboxers on the <br/>
&gt;trail, OldShoe and I set out on Monday for the "Beach View by the <br/>
&gt;Dunes," another Rainbow's End box, located at Warren Dunes State Park <br/>
&gt;in Sawyer, MI.  After what must have been at least 3 miles of up and <br/>
&gt;down those dreadful Michigan sand dunes, we were nearing the end of <br/>
&gt;the clues, and passed a man and a woman looking for something in the <br/>
&gt;woods.  The thought crossed our mind that they may be letterboxers, <br/>
&gt;but we continued on to the next landmark without saying anything and <br/>
&gt;found the box nestled in its hiding spot along the edge of the <br/>
&gt;beach.  As we sat a little way down the beach stamping in, we saw the <br/>
&gt;man and woman we had passed earlier pointing to the steel pole and <br/>
&gt;making a bee-line for the box hiding spot!  OldShoe went and asked <br/>
&gt;them if they were looking for the box...  Sure enough!  More <br/>
&gt;letterboxers!  Turns out it was also their very first letterbox, and <br/>
&gt;I'm sorry that we had the box out and they didn't get that thrill of <br/>
&gt;seeing that first box hiding in its spot!  But, it was nice to meet <br/>
&gt;more boxers...  so welcome also to OldSoul and YoungHeart from <br/>
&gt;Chicago, IL.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;On Tuesday we headed over to pick up Matt the Rat's Chicago Portage <br/>
&gt;box, wondering if we could make it a sweep...  We found the box, safe <br/>
&gt;and sound, but no other letterboxers at this one!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Ahhh, there is finally a number behind that lonely little "X."  Oh, <br/>
&gt;but Doug, you're not off the hook for that cup of coffee...  the more <br/>
&gt;exchanges the merrier!<br/>

&gt;Deb - You can boost up your exchange number!  It's not the number of <br/>
&gt;exchange incidents, it's the number of stamps.  Sounds like you have <br/>

&gt;&gt; next the trail, looking anxiously from one side to the other.  I <br/>
&gt;&gt; remembered passing her earlier on the trail and she had not been <br/>
&gt;&gt; alone.  Since she happened to be standing at the precise spot where <br/>
&gt;&gt; one would enter the woods in pursuit of another letterbox at this <br/>
&gt;&gt; park, I glanced into the woods, and sure enough there was the rest <br/>
&gt;of <br/>
&gt;&gt; her party stamping into the box!  It was a first all-around, as <br/>
&gt;Dave, <br/>
&gt;&gt; Lydia, Scott and Kristen (and guard Oma) were not only stamping into <br/>
&gt;&gt; the "First Letterbox on the Lake" (by Rainbow's End), but it was <br/>
&gt;&gt; their first ever letterbox find, and an exchange first for all of <br/>
&gt;&gt; us!  So welcome to these newbies from West Michigan!<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Still on the high of actually meeting other letterboxers on the <br/>
&gt;&gt; trail, OldShoe and I set out on Monday for the "Beach View by the <br/>
&gt;&gt; Dunes," another Rainbow's End box, located at Warren Dunes State <br/>
&gt;Park <br/>
&gt;&gt; in Sawyer, MI.  After what must have been at least 3 miles of up and <br/>
&gt;&gt; down those dreadful Michigan sand dunes, we were nearing the end of <br/>
&gt;&gt; the clues, and passed a man and a woman looking for something in the <br/>
&gt;&gt; woods.  The thought crossed our mind that they may be letterboxers, <br/>
&gt;&gt; but we continued on to the next landmark without saying anything and <br/>
&gt;&gt; found the box nestled in its hiding spot along the edge of the <br/>
&gt;&gt; beach.  As we sat a little way down the beach stamping in, we saw <br/>
&gt;the <br/>
&gt;&gt; man and woman we had passed earlier pointing to the steel pole and <br/>
&gt;&gt; making a bee-line for the box hiding spot!  OldShoe went and asked <br/>
&gt;&gt; them if they were looking for the box...  Sure enough!  More <br/>
&gt;&gt; letterboxers!  Turns out it was also their very first letterbox, and <br/>
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry that we had the box out and they didn't get that thrill of <br/>
&gt;&gt; seeing that first box hiding in its spot!  But, it was nice to meet <br/>
&gt;&gt; more boxers...  so welcome also to OldSoul and YoungHeart from <br/>
&gt;&gt; Chicago, IL.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; On Tuesday we headed over to pick up Matt the Rat's Chicago Portage <br/>
&gt;&gt; box, wondering if we could make it a sweep...  We found the box, <br/>
&gt;safe <br/>
&gt;&gt; and sound, but no other letterboxers at this one!<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Ahhh, there is finally a number behind that lonely little "X."  Oh, <br/>
&gt;&gt; but Doug, you're not off the hook for that cup of coffee...  the <br/>
&gt;more <br/>
&gt;&gt; exchanges the merrier!<br/>

&gt;&gt; Deb - You can boost up your exchange number!  It's not the number <br/>
&gt;of <br/>
&gt;&gt; exchange incidents, it's the number of stamps.  Sounds like you <br/>
&gt;have <br/>
&gt;&gt; X6.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;Actually, since they were new, they didn't all have their own stamps <br/>
&gt;yet.  The first group was sharing one stamp, and the couple on the <br/>
&gt;second day also shared one stamp.  But hey, I'm happy with 2 <br/>
&gt;exchanges.  And thrilled to see more folks from the upper midwest <br/>
&gt;getting involved in the hobby!<br/>

&gt;The log said that the hitcher started out in River Bend Park.  What <br/>
&gt;state is that?  :-)<br/>
