and looks like a naked Superwoman. Now we have double trouble with <br/>
The Clone and Die Uber Frau. Watch out, these super powers can be a <br/>
bit intimidating! I've been notified that there is a West Coast Clone <br/>
HH too! Yikes, this reminds me of the pod people. Now that was a <br/>
scary movie for me when I was little. <br/>
   Hiker, I LOVE your new personal stamp. Wow! Thanks for the image. <br/>
I really need to recarve mine as it's just crumbling away. Besides <br/>
she's just too simple. Maybe that's why she's psycho!<br/>
