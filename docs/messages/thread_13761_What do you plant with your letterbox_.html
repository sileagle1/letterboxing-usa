We put in the stamp, folded up paper towel to clean the stamp, log book, <br/>
info on letterboxing and a pen.  There has been talk about first finder <br/>
certificates (I believe there is a sample one on the site).  We have not <br/>

things -- seeing how everyone does their box and their clues.  Each one <br/>
reflects the planter.  That makes it even more special.<br/>

<br/>
Submitting clues is easy!!  Just visit www.letterboxing.org and click <br/>
at the bottom where it says "submit clues"  If you have <br/>
not "registered" with the site, this process is easy - just fill out <br/>
the required information.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay - so to submit clues, just click as I mentioned.  There will be <br/>
another screen where it says "add a letterbox".  From there, its a <br/>
really simple form.  What's the name of the box, what state, county, <br/>
nearby city, how many boxes, etc. etc.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want the box announced on the lbox-announce message board, all <br/>
you need to do is click the box for that.  If you mess up, just click <br/>
in the section where it says "your letterboxes" and click the "edit" <br/>
link under your box.  <br/>
<br/>
Pretty darned simple, thanks to Wes!  <br/>

----------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Hello - here's my own experience:<br/>
<br/>
1st Question: I've only recently been the first to a box. It's a nice <br/>
feeling just to start the log book. A certificate - such as the one <br/>
sent out on the list serve is totally OPTIONAL - you can do whatever <br/>
you like. <br/>
<br/>
2nd Question: Here's a list of what I usually put in the box in order <br/>
of basic to optional.<br/>
<br/>
List-o-supplies<br/>
-log book<br/>
-pencil <br/>
-stamp (see list discussion on commercial vs. carved)<br/>
-paper towel or cloth material to protect stamp from elements and use<br/>
-info sheet (print copies for people to take)<br/>
<br/>
Place log book and pencil in a separate plastic ziploc bag.<br/>
Place stamp and pad (see OPTIONAL) in another plastic ziploc bag. <br/>
Wrap the stamp in either a papertowel or piece of cloth material.<br/>
Usually put the info sheet on top of everything. The info sheet is <br/>
especially effective if non-letterboxers happen to find the box. You <br/>
can find this file to print on the letterboxing "getting started" <br/>
link.<br/>
<br/>
OPTIONAL:<br/>
small golf pencils work nicely - some people prefer pens, but unless <br/>
you go all out and buy expensive acidfree then the ink from a pen <br/>
will ultimately fade. If you're into archiving and want to view your <br/>
log books with stamps 50 years from now, use a pencil or invest in a <br/>
nice acid free pen.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp pad...ah- the stamp pad...if you start shopping around and <br/>
browsing through rubber stamping magazines/books/articles...etc, <br/>
you'll see that there are a multitude of options. I prefer acid free <br/>
stamp pads - but remember that it is TRULY OPTIONAL for you to <br/>
include a stamp pad with the box. In the UK I believe the boxes are <br/>
smaller and most often do not contain a stamp pad since it is theived <br/>
easily. It's always a good precaution to bring your own no matter <br/>
what.<br/>
<br/>
If you're looking to generate interest in your region I would <br/>
probably start the first box with more than enough essentials- ie: <br/>
plenty of info sheets and maybe a rubber stamp pad too. <br/>
<br/>
When writing your clue - maybe include that information for the would-<br/>
be searchers to know. Tell them if they need a compass, or a stamp <br/>
pad or something unique to enhance the experience. <br/>
<br/>
One more option are markers. From my findings so far (and they are <br/>
quite limited....) I haven't really come across other boxers or <br/>
stampers that use colored markers. They are highly effective if you <br/>
want to leave a colorful stamp and are inexpensive if you only use <br/>
them for yourself. It is just a suggestion - take all of this for <br/>
what you might need and feel free to not use any of it!!<br/>
<br/>
HAPPY BOXING~!<br/>
