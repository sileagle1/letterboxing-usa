                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hopefully this will not come under the category of "Beating a Dead Horse" (What a great letterbox name)nor do I intend to rekindle the flame. I just finished editing all of our clue pages, which took several hours and thought I would share my new request that is posted on those clue pages. If any wishes to use it please cut and paste and edit away. I'm frankly not as concerned about "Finders" information services as I used to be. The individual sites are limited in size, one that ripped off the LBNA logo patch is about 50 members and the other New One is 65 or so. They get limited information and what information they post for their members will be old and in many cases flawed. If they post spoilers they only hurt themselves and ruin the hunt for their subscribers. They do not have the "Contact Placer" up dates on the non member letterboxes they post information on. Without the cooperation of placers there is no way their data is viable and current. So the only method a finder has of getting current data is to contact the placer directly or post requests on the LBNA chat list. If they merely go to a data base they are just fooling themselves about the information being current. I'm not sure why folks think that they need another type of information service but my guess is that there are some folks that like to make letterboxing as easy and simple and increase their "F" count with as little effort as possible. I doubt that you will find many of their subscribers or members with very high "P" counts but of course I may be entirely wrong. In any case the request I posted is at the bottom of this post. Hopefully if the finder of our letterbox likes the hunt,hike,clues or stamp they will honor our request.<br/>

Please contact placer directly or through the LBNA chat list regarding status rather than unofficial data bases. Up to date status can only be ascertained from placer as other information services will not have current data. Listing information about this letterbox on unauthorized information services is not appreciated by the placer.<br/>
