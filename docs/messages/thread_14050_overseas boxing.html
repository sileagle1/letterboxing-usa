Hi Jena Marie <br/>
 Re:Scotish letterboxes<br/>
The site you are looking for is:<br/>
http://www.ian.kirkpatrich2.btinternet.co.uk or simply type in <br/>
The `Dartmoor Bounders'<br/>
Go to the off Dartmoor page and scroll down to Scotland.<br/>
<br/>
Most boxes are to be found in the Highlands north of Edingburgh<br/>
There are a couple of dozen listings; many are on mountains <br/>
called `munros' or mountains over 4000 feet high.<br/>
There is an element of danger in collecting the Isle of Skye boxes in <br/>
the Cullins Mountains. These are really only recommended for the <br/>
experienced hill walker. <br/>
<br/>
Have a great trip and do let us know if you spot `Nessie'<br/>
Happy letterboxing <br/>
The Squeeeezeboxers<br/>

Hope your trip goes well.  It should be fun.  Let us know what you find.<br/>

ps. this site wasn't the one that gave me the bad clues for my own trip, in<br/>
case you were wondering.<br/>
