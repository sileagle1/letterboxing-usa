                    <div class="plaintext-content">With the help of some friends, Kathy in VA who carved the new stamp <br/>
and Bob in RI who replaced the letterbox, Ft Wetherill in Jamestown <br/>
RI is again on the map! This is one of the nicest little islands in <br/>
New England and well worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood. The <br/>
old clues are on our personal website at<br/>
<br/>
http://members.aol.com/drewclan/conancut.htm#Wetherill<br/>
<br/>
and will soon have the following addition from Bob:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;I placed the box this morning, about 25 ft. from the original <br/>
spot. To find it you would still follow the old clues right up to the <br/>
standpipe. When you reach the standpipe look for a small clump of <br/>
bushes at a heading of 230. Walk down to the bushes and have a seat <br/>
on the rock in front of the bushes. The lighthouse will be at 190 and <br/>
to the left, at a reading of 120 you should see an outer layer of <br/>
quartz in the cliffs. If you're in the right spot and you can see the <br/>
quartz all you need do is turn around and look for the box under the <br/>
split rock. Good luck.<br/>
Bob&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much to Kathy and Bob! Now we're in the unique position <br/>
of having to go search for a new version of one of "our own" <br/>
letterboxes, although it's now under truly multi-state ownership!<br/>
<br/>
Jay in CT, and ps: Bob has also recarved and rehidden the letterbox <br/>
at Fort Adams in Newport, RI!<br/>
