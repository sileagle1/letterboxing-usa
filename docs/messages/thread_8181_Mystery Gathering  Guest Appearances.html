&gt; Hello Everyone!<br/>
&gt; When we received our first invitation from Tom No one to assemble, <br/>
I posed a question whether or not certain coveted letterboxing <br/>
treasures and/or their creator would make their appearances. No news, <br/>
so here it is again.<br/>
&gt; Amongst those is KMartha, whose namesake is steeped in controversy <br/>
just now. Is this a GOOD THING, fair Martha?  KMartha, have you gone <br/>
underground since your name has been sullied?  Has anyone seen you <br/>
lately? *Sigh* It's been months.Perhaps if you graced us with your <br/>
presence seven days hence, I am sure this would go a long way toward <br/>
restoring your "tarnished"reputation. Please don't be too busy <br/>
polishing the silver to come and play.<br/>
&gt; Another gem is the venerable Flutterby who I believe fluttered into <br/>
Virginia just recently. Will this lovely specimen set free from the <br/>
land and hand of Legerdemaine find its way north before flitting off <br/>
on its next journey.<br/>
&gt; And what about you, Legerdemaine? We've not heard a whisper from <br/>
you about any sort of mysterious and magical transport of your being <br/>
to our midst. You are most welcome, you know. <br/>

<br/>
     Sounds to me like you're asking for a spoiler.  How about a <br/>
hint?  At a minimum there will be a sideshow, a revival, a seasonal <br/>
confection, a mysterious stranger, and more carnival than <br/>
most 'boxers can endure... not to mention the new boxes.  Speaking of <br/>
which, I see that you've given us a peek at the event stamp in the <br/>
files section... and it's among the finest stamps I've seen, both in <br/>
design and execution.  Extraordinary work!<br/>
