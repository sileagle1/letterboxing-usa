                    <div class="plaintext-content">ok, I posted my sit rep for "along the way" box (Spring Chick) last <br/>
week, but for some reason my post did not take...so:<br/>
<br/>
I found the "along the way" box placed by Spring Chick in Deleware. <br/>
the box is in very good condition and apparently very active (someone <br/>
visited the week prior to my visit)<br/>
<br/>
today (in Ohio) i located the "fishin" and "lilac garden" boxes <br/>
placed by franzsolo.  Both are in fine shape. the "fishin" box was <br/>
rather wet, so i dried out the contents some and repacked.  <br/>
The "lilac garden" box was apparently kickout by the critter patrol, <br/>
so after stamping, i rehid it in it's original position.<br/>
<br/>
now, i have a question:  the "fishin" box contained three stamps <br/>
("fishin", "meyer rara flora", and "braams garden").  Do I get FOUND <br/>
credit for all three stamps? or for just one since all three were in <br/>
ONE BOX?<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
