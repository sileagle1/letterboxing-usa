You never actually affirmed Ms. Post's opinion that I am no longer<br/>
considered a suspect in the crime in question.  Would you please let me know<br/>
if I am now free to travel abroad?  You see, I have a rapidly approaching<br/>
appointment at a famous auction house in London, an appointment that was<br/>
difficult to come by and will be more difficult to arrange again.<br/>
<br/>
And have you ever even given any thought to the fact that it may not have<br/>
been a letterboxer at all who stole the Store of Good Manners?  Hmmm?   I<br/>
would think by now you would have realized that we are by and large a very<br/>
mannerly group of folks.  Have you perhaps looked among the rich and<br/>
famous?  Possibly someone who has recently been in jail and who has tried to<br/>
use their position to win a more favorable venue to serve out their<br/>
sentence?  Tell me - doesn't that wreak of bad manners to you?  By the very<br/>
reticent nature of the letterboxing community, we would make perfect<br/>
scapegoats for a high profile person who wishes not to be scrutinized.<br/>
Given Don's background in security work in California, wouldn't you think it<br/>
might be a good idea to solicit his assistance in pursuing such an avenue?<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about anyone else, but for my part, I'm growing weary of the<br/>
waiting.  It's the not knowing that is the worst!<br/>

<br/>
And you know, neither of them ever responded to MY question about where the<br/>
theft took place, or to Der Mad Stamper's question about when.<br/>
<br/>
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  Maybe this whole investigation thing is<br/>
a smokescreen to cover for them, and they are the true thieves of the<br/>
Store!  Maybe WE should investigate THEM!<br/>
