Planted another box on the same trail as the Beltane Box, so that <br/>
will be a two-box trail as soon as I get the clues posted.<br/>
<br/>
Headed up to Deer Creek Canyon, and caught the recently planted "Deer <br/>
Creek" box.  I was stunned to see that two people had snagged it <br/>
before me (there are so few boxers in CO).  Team Min Dawg was one of <br/>
them!  *waves*  Then we headed up to get the Jolly G Man's "Soar <br/>
Feet" box.  What a beautiful hike! <br/>
<br/>
Both boxes were in great shape.  I put a pen in the Soar Feet Box, <br/>
which hasn't been visited that often, but is really on a spectacular <br/>
trail!<br/>
<br/>
Hey two "finds" in one day in Colorado is something to do the happy <br/>
dance about!  <br/>
