<br/>When we left Froggy and Robin, they were headed off towards Destiny.  What we didn't tell you is that Destiny is the name of Froggy's love shack.  Destiny had set Froggy back a pretty penny but it was well worth it.  The mood lighting, revolving bed, and huge supply of Firefly brand love potion insured that any chickie lucky enough to enter the room would walk out with ruffled feathers.  
<br/>
<br/>Robin had heard of Froggy's trysting lair but nothing prepared her for the sight.  She was already a little tipsy from the champagne and shots of Courvoisier Froggy had forced down her gullet and the lights were making her dizzy.  As the sultry sounds of Barry White echoed through the air, Froggy flicked on the lava lamp and leered suggestively at Robin as he disrobed.  Overwhelmed by the alcohol, the lights, and her overwhelming passion, Robin fell off of her perch and right into Froggy's waiting arms.
<br/>
<br/>(Since this is a wholesome, family pursuit, I will stop here and allow you to imagine the rest.  Needless to say, Robin woke up the next morning with a tadpole in the oven and a terrible hangover.)
<br/>
<br/>Follow the directions for the Robin's nest box and get back on Vestal's Gap Road. (towards the Frogshackle Diner)  Locate the bench off of the trail to the right.  There will be an orange arrow marking the Old Oak Trail.  Take this trail to the right of the bench and at the Y go left.  As you come around a bend in the trail, find the fallen tree on the right side. (the trail winds around the base of the tree)   Standing at the root end of this tree, locate its still standing twin to the left covered in vines.  Froggy and Robin's love child lives behind this tree under some sticks and a small rock.  Backtrack to Vestal's Gap Road and continue to the right back to the parking lot.
