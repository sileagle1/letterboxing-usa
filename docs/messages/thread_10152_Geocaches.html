<br/>
Sure!  Why not?  What's the worst that can happen?  Getting bombed <br/>
with hate mail?  It's kind of fun sometimes.  *wink*  Just kidding, <br/>
of course.  =)  I'm not always the most well-loved person on this <br/>
board, but I rarely get hate mail!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; When following coordinates do geocachers stick to trails, or is<br/>
&gt; there a tendency to blaze your own trail in order to follow those<br/>
&gt; coordinates?<br/>
<br/>
I think they tend to stay on trail--for as long as possible, at <br/>
least.  Follow the path of least resistance.  Same reason you'll see <br/>
deer or mice running down a trail instead of off to either side.<br/>

Dare I ask a question about geocaches?  My understanding (never having seen one) is that these are found by following coordinates with little GPS systems.  I totally admit ignorance of this topic but my question is this: "When following coordinates do geocachers stick to trails, or is there a tendency to blaze your own trail in order to follow those coordinates?"  I am not trying to incite a riot, just asking an honest question that I have wondered about for a while.<br/>

It all depends on the geocache and the geocachers.  SOme a very into "leave no trace" where others are not ... pretty much the same as in letterboxing.
