                    <div class="plaintext-content">Tom and I began letterboxing on May 16, 2003 after looking for something to combine our interests - he's the hiker/nature lover and I'm a rubber stamper.  Yesterday (our 2nd month into this VERY addicting hobby), we found our 100th box!  Of course, over that period of time we've spent 3 entire days in Mansfield, the mecca of boxing, which has helped immensely!!<br/>
<br/>
Here's a report on our finds (and misses) yesterday:<br/>
<br/>
The Kettle Hole Trail Series - fun series, but we didn't find boxes 4, 12, 13 and 16.<br/>
<br/>
My Favorite Actor - it started POURING right after we found the first box in this series.  So, between a slick uphill trail, rain covered glasses that I couldn't see out of, and an initial attempt to sit out the rain under a pine tree, we totally missed the first trail marker.  We ended up finding 4 of the 6 boxes, but totally out of order (Kenneth Branagh, Hamlet, Othello, Henry V).  We learned a very important lesson - keep clues in plastic when there's any threat of rain.  By the end of our hike, we couldn't even read the clues!!<br/>
<br/>
It continued raining, so we took a break to shop for a dry t-shirt (another lesson - bring extra clothes), have lunch, then went to Manchester to buy some new hiking boots and socks.  (Tom told me I had "girlie" boots - and after getting soaked in that rainstorm, I agreed that "real" waterproof hiking boots were a good idea!)<br/>
<br/>
After lunch we stopped in Coventry to pick up the new Worn Yesterday Shoppe stamp.  Barbie is very nice and is enjoying the stream of letterboxers that have started to show up!<br/>
<br/>
Got Milk - Beautiful views; deer in the pasture<br/>
<br/>
Ye Olde Cemetery - Tom got caught in prickers going after this box<br/>
<br/>
100 Years of Hope - great stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Lions Club Park Soccer Fields - just after we found this box, soccer practice started so our timing was great!<br/>
<br/>
Goodnight, Moon - This one was hard to find - and it was laying right out in the open when Tom did find it (I stayed on the dry road and let him do the work)!!<br/>
<br/>
We got the first box in the Oxen Adventure Series - another GREAT stamp!<br/>
<br/>
We attempted to look for Population, but couldn't figure it out.  Maybe we were too tired and waterlogged by then!!<br/>
<br/>
It was a great day and fun to reach a milestone!!<br/>
