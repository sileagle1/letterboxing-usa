<br/>
Start your search on the front step of the I&amp;M Canal Visitor Center, which is in a canal-side <br/>
warehouse built in 1838. <br/>
<br/>
Walk up to the former I&amp;M Canal Headquarters up the hill. After a visit in the museum here, head to <br/>
your right to see some of the well-preserved downtown buildings from the canal's heyday.<br/>
<br/>
At the stoplight, turn right. When you reach the Wells Corner School, turn the corner down a gravel <br/>
lane. Passing by several more old buildings, keep an eye out for a small structure that might be <br/>
described as Abraham Lincoln's dog house. Turn left at the house here, down a few stairs and then <br/>
continue to the right to a dark cave-like opening.<br/>
<br/>
Now cross over the bridge you'll see nearby. At the far end of the bridge, look for a street sign, and <br/>
just beyond it, a dying tree. At the base of the tree, find a small hole where the letterbox is hidden. <br/>
<br/>
Be very discrete when reaching for the box so that none of the neighbors will see you! After stamping <br/>
the logbook, please be careful to place some bark or a small log in front of the hole to hide it again.<br/>
