<br/>
I checked the FAQs in Letterboxing.org and didn't see anything about personal travelers.  I don't really know much about them.  I have my signature stamp, but I also carry another stamp with me and I want to designate it as my personal traveler.  I am a great fan of the Lord of the Rings.  Those of you in the Postal Letterboxing Group can attest to this.  If you should see me (let's say - at the Monster Mash in CT, lol), then tell me the name of the Lord of all horses - the one that Gandolf rides to Rohan, then you may stamp your logbook with my stamp entitled The Symbol of Rohan.  Believe me, you'll love it!<br/>
