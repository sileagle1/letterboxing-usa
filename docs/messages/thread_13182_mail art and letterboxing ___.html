I love mail art.  I actually trade a lot of art by mail, and you should just<br/>
SEE the envelopes that people make to send stuff in - its stunning.  We did<br/>
a whole exchange based on drawing an envelope to "match" the stamp used to<br/>
mail the piece.  Carved stamps are definitely art - and I do love to see<br/>
everyone's carvings as I hunt for boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Which brings up another issue that I've been toying around in my head a bit.<br/>
I live in Colorado - and there are few letterboxers here, and all the boxes<br/>
worth finding seem to require a several hour drive or a hike up a fourteener<br/>
(or both).  *sheesh*  So - I am planting away in the hopes of attracting<br/>
more to the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I keep coming back to the idea of a letterbox that arrives in<br/>
your letterbox!  hehe!  That is ... a letterbox that finds you by mail.<br/>
It's a tricky idea, and Im not sure how to pull it off yet - but I'm<br/>
thinking (and open to hear your thoughts and suggestions) about sending a<br/>
log book and stamp to someone (CodyBCleo has volunteered on my short list of<br/>
folks so far).  Then you'd stamp in as you would with any other box, and<br/>
then mail it along to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
The trick is keeping the box moving, being willing to pay the postage for<br/>
the item to move along, and including addresses of willing letterboxers who<br/>
want the box.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts and suggestions?<br/>

Have  any letterboxers out there ever  heard of "Mail Art".??<br/>
Call me CrAzY ,but I don't like to waste a perfectly good letterbox stamp<br/>
image .<br/>
 So I stamp all my utility bill return envelopes with my latest letterbox<br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
 The way I see it you can give the postman something to look at (and try to<br/>
figure out what the heck it is ), and on down the line to&gt; the person that<br/>
opens the envelope something cool to look at besides a boring bland envelope<br/>

Hey Franzsolo!<br/>
I love mail art.  I actually trade a lot of art by mail, and you should just<br/>
SEE the envelopes that people make to send stuff in - its stunning.  We did<br/>
a whole exchange based on drawing an envelope to "match" the stamp used to<br/>
mail the piece.  Carved stamps are definitely art - and I do love to see<br/>
everyone's carvings as I hunt for boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Which brings up another issue that I've been toying around in my head a bit.<br/>
I live in Colorado - and there are few letterboxers here, and all the boxes<br/>
worth finding seem to require a several hour drive or a hike up a fourteener<br/>
(or both).  *sheesh*  So - I am planting away in the hopes of attracting<br/>
more to the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I keep coming back to the idea of a letterbox that arrives in<br/>
your letterbox!  hehe!  That is ... a letterbox that finds you by mail.<br/>
It's a tricky idea, and Im not sure how to pull it off yet - but I'm<br/>
thinking (and open to hear your thoughts and suggestions) about sending a<br/>
log book and stamp to someone (CodyBCleo has volunteered on my short list of<br/>
folks so far).  Then you'd stamp in as you would with any other box, and<br/>
then mail it along to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
The trick is keeping the box moving, being willing to pay the postage for<br/>
the item to move along, and including addresses of willing letterboxers who<br/>
want the box.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts and suggestions?<br/>

franzsolo here ...<br/>
Have  any letterboxers out there ever  heard of "Mail Art".??<br/>
Call me CrAzY ,but I don't like to waste a perfectly good letterbox stamp<br/>
image .<br/>
So I stamp all my utility bill return envelopes with my latest letterbox<br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it you can give the postman something to look at (and try to<br/>
figure out what the heck it is ), and on down the line to&gt; the person that<br/>
opens the envelope something cool to look at besides a boring bland envelope<br/>
