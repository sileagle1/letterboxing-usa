Directions: From RT.6 turn onto Potter road.This will be the entrance to<br/>
Goodwin State Forest in Hampton CT.Follow the road a little ways and you<br/>
will come to 11th Section road which is a right turn.Travel down 11th<br/>
Section road 1.3 miles where the road turns sharply and there is a sign<br/>
that says Esterbrook RD. Take a left here onto a unmarked road,Travel<br/>
down .3 mile and you will see a pull off area on the right, park there.<br/>
You will also see trails on both sides of the road, cross the road and<br/>
take the White blazed trail left of a dirt road.( Don't forget the clues<br/>
for Black Spruce Pond and The Forgotten Wood Pile,for they are near by.)<br/>
Enter the trail and follow the white blazes for a while until you come<br/>
to a T in the trail.Take a right here and continue on you will come to a<br/>
intersection,take a right here onto the Blue blazed trail.(Do not go<br/>
straight across follow the blue trail on the right.) Follow the trail<br/>
down to the pond and you will see a Dam on your left,cross over and<br/>
follow the trail up a little hill their will be two trails to choose,<br/>
stay with the blue and follow around the pond.Once you round the pond<br/>
the trail will start getting rocky.The rocky trail will get better as<br/>
you go up a small hill,at the top on your left is a pile of rocks that<br/>
look like a fire place.Keep going a little more and the trail will get<br/>
rocky again,and then the rocks are gone.Twisting and turning with the<br/>
blue you will soon come to a T.Go right onto a wider trail and soon you<br/>
will come to a intersection with a dirt road,turn right here and follow<br/>
the dirt road.You will go up a small hill,when you almost get to the<br/>
top,you will see a rock ledge sticking out of the banking on your left<br/>
with a oak tree that splits into two sisters just before it.Behind that<br/>
is a stone wall,Behind that wall under some flat rocks is the Sucker<br/>
Fish Letterbox.From here you can continue on this dirt road and it will<br/>
bring you back to your car.A sucker fish is usually a type of carp fish<br/>
that feeds off the bottom of the pond.They spend a lot of time swimming<br/>
around this pond for nothing.Thats why they call them Suckers.The<br/>
