 So what is it? You (the administrator) just put up what you want to <br/>
say? I don't get it. <br/>
How do you have a conversation when you are the only one talking?<br/>

correct, that would be a waste of time then as it would be nothing more than a blogger now wouldn't it?<br/>
<br/>
A forum is  a little more secure in the fact that it's harder for one to join than a mailing list (typically) in that people can not<br/>
just create a yahoo account (Or other webmail based system) and get access.  So, in the case of the mailing list here, we turn on<br/>
moderation and no one can post unless their posts are approved.  That stops the spam, but puts a strain on the moderators has has<br/>
been evidenced in the past here.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a proponent of Forums because it allows you more flexibility. But I didn't say I was going to leave this mailing list (Sorry,<br/>
didn't want to get anyone's hopes up! (grin)) just because I like forums more.<br/>
<br/>
If you wish to know more, try one of two things Amanda.  Come to the WoL website and take a look or write to me in private and we'll<br/>
discuss it further.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">At one point last year somebody set up a forum called the <br/>
Letterboxing EZ board.  I do not recall who initiated this, but it <br/>
is a very nicely designed site as far as forums go.  A handful of <br/>
people signed up and there was a fair amount of activity late last <br/>
summer/early fall, then it kind of faded off and it doesn't appear <br/>
there is much going on over there any more.  This is strictly a <br/>
discussion forum, there is no associated database of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I am not advocating forum over Yahoo! talk list, I am fine with <br/>
either.  But the forum format does have some real advantages -- the <br/>
compartmentalization allow for separate regional boards and separate <br/>
boards based on topic all at one place, rather than having to sign <br/>
up for 25 different Yahoo lists.  You have the ability to track <br/>
responses to your posts via e-mail without getting a mailbox full of <br/>
messages that do not pertain to topics of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it was just an idea before its time?  If you are not <br/>
familiar with the forum format, check it out here:<br/>
