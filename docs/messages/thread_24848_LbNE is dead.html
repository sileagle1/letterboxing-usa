Here's the response I recieved from yahoogroups:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<hello, <br="">
<br/>
Thank you for writing to Yahoo! Groups.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you're wondering what happened to your "LbNE" <br/>
group. I<br/>
assure you, I'm always glad to be of help.<br/>
<br/>
First, please note that Yahoo! may, in appropriate circumstances and <br/>
in <br/>
its sole discretion, terminate Groups that appear to have violated <br/>
the <br/>
Yahoo! Terms of Service (TOS). <br/>
<br/>
In some cases, Groups may be deleted by an Owner or Moderator. <br/>
<br/>
Going forward, our record shows that your "LbNE" group was deleted by <br/>
one of the group's owners on May 8, 2008. Please keep in mind that <br/>
Group<br/>
owners have total control over their Group. Yahoo! Groups has neither <br/>
authority nor influence over these decisions. You might want to <br/>
contact <br/>
the group's owner regarding this matter. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, Yahoo! Groups maintains member privacy at all times. Due <br/>
to<br/>
our privacy policy we are not allowed to disclose any member's <br/>
personal <br/>
information such as Yahoo! ID, name, contact numbers and email <br/>
addresses. If you don't know the owner's contact information, an <br/>
option <br/>
available to you is ask other members of the concerned group that you <br/>
know of if they know the contact details of the deleted group's owner.<br/>
<br/>
