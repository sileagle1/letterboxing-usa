                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had some time Thursday and Friday during and after a business <br/>
conference in Hyannis to pick up a few boxes.  I found the following <br/>
in good shape:<br/>
<br/>
A Very Gorey Letterbox<br/>
Scargo Tower<br/>
Ghost Train<br/>
Black Crow at Quivet<br/>
The Forgotten Road<br/>
Briar Patch #1<br/>
Briar Patch #2<br/>
<br/>
Also, after many dry months I seem to have become a HH magnet.  I <br/>
found the Hourglass HH at Scargo Tower, and Fingers Crossed HH at <br/>
Ghost Train.<br/>
<br/>
I have to give kudos to Will aka the Headless Hunter.  His boxes are <br/>
very well put together and very well hidden.  Good job!<br/>
<br/>
I looked for the Briar Patch boxes last year at this time, and only <br/>
had luck with number one.  I'm embarrassed to say how easily I found <br/>
number two on this second attempt.  I think that last year I was <br/>
under the mistaken impression that there were three boxes, and I ran <br/>
myself ragged trying to make the landmarks fit.<br/>
