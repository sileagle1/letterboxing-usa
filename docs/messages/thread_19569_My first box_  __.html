Oh, and no, I didn't see your little note and use an exacto knife so that I could re-use the envelop 'cause I SUCK!!! I'm am pretty darn cranky and could use a nap but Dude the Wonder Dog and I are heading down to DE to find out why my Steal Your Face box keeps washing out in the rain. I will also try to find the elusive Brandywine Springs Park to hunt HSC Pride's boxes there. It's supposed to be off of Route 34 and 141 but I have driven up and down 141 and can't find 34! Team KeepPressingOn sent me some tips so I'm gonna give it a shot. Or take a nap....one or the other. <br/>

  Just wanted to share my excitement with you all.  :)  I planted my first <br/>
  letterbox tonight, a tribute to my mom.  And my next one will be a tribute to my <br/>
  great grandmother.  I bought the stamp tonight.  It's perfect.  :)<br/>
<br/>
  Just wanted to share.  I also passed on my first hitchhiker that I found two <br/>
  days ago, and found my first bonus box.  It was a day of letterboxing firsts.  <br/>

  My friend, who I got hooked on letterboxing, came over last night and was <br/>
  telling me how frustrated she was that she'd found a hitchhiker in a box and <br/>
  hadn't known what it was until she called me to say that someone had put an <br/>
  additional stamp in the box she'd found.  She didn't know to take it.  She was still <br/>
  kicking herself when she got to my place at 10:30 pm, so we jumped into the <br/>

I would definitely stamp it into my HH logbook, but I  would not count it as<br/>
a find.  If the box saw reasonable activity, I would probably leave it there<br/>
for the next finder.  If it was rarely visited, I would move the HH along.<br/>

Philosophical Question to Ponder:<br/>
<br/>
If one finds a hitchhiker while doing maintenance on one's boxes,<br/>
should one bag the find?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A hitchhiker has to have at least a stamp and a logbook.  Most do <br/>
not have their own inkpad or pencil to save space.  Since they are <br/>
only found in other letterboxes, you can use that boxes supplies to <br/>
stamp in. It's also a good idea to have your own stamp pad.  A lot <br/>
of boxes don't have one, or they've dried out.<br/>
<br/>
 As for the ziploc, a hitchhiker(stamp and logbook) is usually <br/>
contained by some kind of container.  I put mine in 35mm film <br/>
canisters. I've found some that are just in a baggie and others that <br/>
are in their own little boxes.<br/>
<br/>
And I say if you find a HH in your own box, log it as a find, and <br/>
it's up to you wether to move it along or leave it behind.  Take it <br/>
if you expect to visit other letterboxes soon. Leave it if you don't <br/>
so someone else can relocate it quickly and it doesn't sit in your <br/>
backpack for months.<br/>

<br/>
Just wanted to share.  I also passed on my first hitchhiker that I found two <br/>
days ago, and found my first bonus box.  It was a day of letterboxing firsts.  <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
My friend, who I got hooked on letterboxing, came over last night and was <br/>
telling me how frustrated she was that she'd found a hitchhiker in a box and <br/>
hadn't known what it was until she called me to say that someone had put an <br/>
additional stamp in the box she'd found.  She didn't know to take it.  She was still <br/>
kicking herself when she got to my place at 10:30 pm, so we jumped into the <br/>
car and found the park, and found the box, so she could retrieve it.  ;)  I <br/>
wouldn't ordinarily recommend letterboxing at 11 pm in a questionable area, but <br/>
she was bound and determined.  ;)<br/>
