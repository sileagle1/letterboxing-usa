regions are not conducive to letterboxing, so we came up with<br/>
a new set of regions that we hope are more letterbox-friendly.<br/>
To make these changes, the webmasters sent me a spreadsheet<br/>
with all the Texas counties (over 250) and their current regions,<br/>
which I updated and sent back.  They will have to implement<br/>
these changes and redraw the map graphic before you will see<br/>
a change on the Texas clue page.  But in the mean time, you can<br/>
see how it will look by going to the Files section and looking<br/>
at txregions.jpg, which is a map I created showing Texas <br/>
regions and counties.<br/>
For all those letterboxers that live in states with counties<br/>
in incorrect regions, you can pick one representative to request<br/>
your state's spreadsheet and make the corrections yourself.<br/>
If you want regions changed, make a proposal to other members<br/>
of your state, either on your Regional Talklist or here, come<br/>
to a consensus and send in the updated spreadsheet.<br/>
Many thanks to my fellow Texas letterboxers for helping with<br/>
this project, Brett Costley for letting me know about the<br/>
spreadsheet option, and the webmasters (mainly Wes) for the<br/>
work they will do!<br/>
