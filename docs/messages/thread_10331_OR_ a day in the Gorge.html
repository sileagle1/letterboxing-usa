                    <div class="plaintext-content">On this crisp and sunny January day, Windairen and Funhog initiated<br/>
WhizBang into the world of letterboxing. We headed for the Columbia<br/>
River Gorge with hopes of finding Der Mad Stamper's Horsetail Falls<br/>
and Triple Falls boxes, Ryan's replica of the long, lost Ponytail<br/>
Falls box, Funhog's Octopus and Paisley Orca's Lemur boxes. <br/>
<br/>
We were successful with four of the five. Ryan's hiding place was<br/>
typically sneaky and took the three of us much longer than usual to<br/>
discover. The poor Lemur was in danger of suffering from overexposure,<br/>
the stones secreting it in its hole having been removed and the box in<br/>
plain view. This portion of the trail felt the full force of the<br/>
strong east winds, forty mile an hour gusts and all. Brrrrr.... Once<br/>
back in Oneonta Gorge, it was perfectly calm and made for a pleasant hike.<br/>
<br/>
Our final goal was the famed Triple Falls box. This gem is known for<br/>
having been in place since 1998, one of the original Oregon<br/>
letterboxes with an intricate handcarved stamp.  Dozens of people have<br/>
found and signed into the log, many of them non-letterboxers who<br/>
stumbled upon it by accident. Even two canine letterboxers had sniffed<br/>
it out! We were baffled by our discovery there. The box was in place<br/>
but inside we found only a cryptic note saying, "letterbox temporarily<br/>
in use" and dated 1/1/03. There was no signature and no further<br/>
explanation. After the three and a half miles we'd walked to get there<br/>
it was disappointing, to say the least. Anybody know who has this box?<br/>
and why? <br/>
