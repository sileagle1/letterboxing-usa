It was a bright, clear day and thought it would clear our heads so to <br/>

I never walked along a ridge line for that great a distance -it was<br/>
very cool.  We didn't pick up any letterboxes along the way; all the <br/>
open areas looked the same and maybe our heads weren't working well<br/>
at the time. Paddy, our dog, ran ahead to some nice people taking a<br/>
Christmas Card photo on the summit.  They said that they're relatives <br/>
are going to ask, "where did you get the dog!"  We exchanged a few <br/>
laughs and went our way. The hike was a wonderful challenge.<br/>

I thought sure we'd at least spot the one that<br/>
was located in the Ciders.  It's just one<br/>
of those things.<br/>
