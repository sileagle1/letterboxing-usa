<br/>
It's probably just as well.  Geocachers and letterboxers don't tend <br/>
to mix anyhow.  But I'm baffled about your professed desire for <br/>
mentally stimulating letterboxing clues but are confounded by <br/>
figuring out where the letterboxes are in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I'm baffled why you feel the Letterboxing North America <br/>
letterboxing website is so agrivating that you should abandon <br/>
letterboxing completely.  The two are complementary, but letterboxing <br/>
is not dependent on this website for its success.  Many clues are not <br/>
posted on the web at all, and half the challenge in finding the <br/>
letterbox is simply trying to aquire the clue!  In addition, there <br/>
are other, alternate, letterboxing websites, along with posted clues <br/>
that may fit your liking more.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, burning bridges on your way out with insults and foul <br/>
language isn't going to accomplish anything but give you--and by <br/>
extention geocachers which you seem to be representing--a bad image.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing isn't for everyone, and there's nothing wrong with <br/>
that.  If you feel geocaching is more your style, you scoot along and <br/>
we'll manage without you.  We've managed without you so far (quite <br/>
successfully, in my opinion), and we'll continue to do so without <br/>
you.  I won't be losing any sleep over your decision.<br/>

&gt; Ryan, could you give me an idea of other websites that are helpful<br/>
in the Pacific Northwest?  I am new at this (and geocaching too). <br/>
Maybe when I get deeper in them, I will choose one or the other.  I<br/>
don't have a GPS myself, and I think I would rather get the clue and<br/>
go for it.  Any help I could get would be appreciated.  Claudia<br/>

Mischief keeps a list of Washington state letterboxes, along with any <br/>
mystery boxes that might be in the area.  The list is at <br/>
http://home1.gte.net/res0fpfm/letterboxes/wa_boxes.htm<br/>
<br/>
There's also a list with a bunch of renegade women flapping around on <br/>
the International Artgirl Letterboxing Cabal (IALC) which I <br/>
discovered while following one of the clues that turns out not to be <br/>
posted on the Letterboxing North America website.  But you need to be <br/>
a girl (which I'm not) and you need to be a member (which I'm not) to <br/>
actually read the clue, so in that case you break down and find <br/>
someone that can print the clues out for you.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Many other local letterboxes have their own websites which list their <br/>
clues (including myself), but the clues are usually listed on LBNA as <br/>
well (most of Bill's aren't, if I recall correctly).  Here are a few <br/>
that I know about:<br/>
<br/>
Mischief: http://pub8.ezboard.com/bmischiefsletterboxes<br/>
Amanda from Seattle: http://www.geocities.com/samanark<br/>
Eliza B: http://www.moderngypsy.com/green/lb<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Any help I could get would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
The Letterboxing North America website is a great resource, but I've <br/>
started creating several "self-helf" kind of pages for carving <br/>
stamps, stamping with multiple colors, creating letterboxes (Mischief <br/>
has a nice page with picture from when she was creating her first <br/>
letterbox, as I recall too which could be useful), and a newbie FAQ <br/>
that I felt should have been included on LBNA but wasn't.  =)  So you <br/>
can check out out on my website.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, the BEST and FUNNEST way to learn about letterboxing--<br/>
just go out and try it.  You wouldn't believe all the imaginative <br/>
things people do with their boxes!<br/>

  It would be nice if the Site was a little more the way of<br/>
Geocaching BUT, I can't begin to think how much it would cost to<br/>
do a website like geocaching.com.  This thing about Letterboxing.org is<br/>
there is no income to help pay for the site!!  Geocaching.com sells (I <br/>
bought for my Hubby) GPS's and other stuff. They also sell Geobugs (Which if <br/>
you look) there is a ton of them out their ($ for $20) so<br/>
there is alot of money in those to help pay for the website.<br/>
<br/>
  If you talk to anyone who has a website, They will tell you that<br/>
cost can be high because the you pay for the amount of Info moved<br/>
(I.E. Trasfer).  So for what it is, Letterboxing.org does not even<br/>
come close to sucking!!!!   This site (With it's few flaws) is done<br/>
very very  very well.<br/>
<br/>
  Also I think that the people who are Letterboxers tend to say a little<br/>
closer (In Contact) then the peopel that do Geocaching.  (We now do both)<br/>
<br/>
    And like they say!  If you don't like the mouse trap, Just try and<br/>
build a better one!!!<br/>
<br/>
  I say Good Luck!!!  (LOL)<br/>
