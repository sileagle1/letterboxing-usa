You are awesome!  We are looking forward to hitting the trails and doing<br/>
Angel's Rest and Latourell Falls soon (like when it's not snowing!) <br/>
Thanks for continuing this series.  Your carvings in this bunch are THE<br/>
BEST!!!  One of these days maybe I'll get them all.  I hope so.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Don't let the snow stop you--the gorge is beautiful when there's a <br/>
light layer of snow on the ground!  =)  I even stopped at Multnomah <br/>
Falls so I could get pictures with snow on the ground there.  Very <br/>
pretty!  It's not more than an inch or so thick (at least when I was <br/>
there!), so it's very hikeable even now.<br/>
<br/>

Speaking of which, that giraffe you told me to hide in a location <br/>
that you could reach--it's loose.  I won't tell you which of the <br/>
locations has it, but the giraffe is running amok.  =)<br/>
