Letterbox Name:  Bamboo Gone Wild<br/>

Description:<br/>
I found this large Bamboo grove while fly-fishing once. It is very <br/>
old and a great deal of fun to crawl through and explore. <br/>
The round-trip walk to the box is about a mile-and-a-half on fairly <br/>
level ground, but it does go over rocky, rooty, thorny, weedy ground <br/>
(Typical along Va. Rivers) and walking in the Bamboo grove requires <br/>
care...so wear good boots, check for ticks, and be careful. Wear <br/>
BLAZE ORANGE if you're there during hunting season.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Kelly's Ford:<br/>
This box is located at the Kelly's Ford Bridge across the Rapahanock <br/>
River in Faquier County, Va.<br/>
Take the FALMOUTH/WARRETON exit off of Interstate 95 and follow the <br/>
signs for WARRENTON (Rt. 17 North). After about 10 miles of driving, <br/>
you'll cross the Stafford/Faquier County line. Drive about two more <br/>
miles then start watching for the signs for Summerduck (Rt 651).<br/>
Turn left onto Rt. 651 and head towards Summerduck.<br/>
After about 8 miles, you'll come to a big curve that goes downhill <br/>
and crosses a low, new bridge. Take the next left after crossing the <br/>
bridge (Rt. 620...you'll see signs indicating Kelly's Ford).<br/>
Drive about a quarter-mile on 620 and you'll come to the Kelly's Ford <br/>
bridge. DO NOT CROSS THE BRIDGE....instead, park in the gravel <br/>
parking lot on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to LetterBox:<br/>
On the river side of the parking lot is a trail which goes upstream. <br/>
Start following the trail making sure you stay up on the hill (Do not <br/>
take any of the the spur trails down to the river). At some point <br/>
you'll see a red sign saying something about the land being  reserved <br/>
for "disabled hunting"...this just means that you can not hunt there <br/>
unless you are disabled, hiking is still allowed. <br/>
After walking a fair distance the trail will start to go away from <br/>
the river. About the time this happens you'll come to a fork in the <br/>
trail. Take the trail to the left (i.e. the one heading back towards <br/>
the river)...a short whole later you'll find another fork. Again, <br/>
take the fork to the left (i.e. towards the river). After the second <br/>
fork start paying close attention to the area around the trail. Not <br/>
long after the second fork you'll pass through a very old split rail <br/>
fence ( I don't think they bought this one at Lowes!!!!). The fence <br/>
is hidden well in the weeds, so keep your eyes open or you'll miss <br/>
it!!<br/>
We're very close now to the letterbox now!!.<br/>
After passing through the split rail fence start looking for a small, <br/>
stone, abandoned water house. Go to the water house and follow the <br/>
trail that goes past the door of the water house. It will turn left <br/>
and lead you back towards the river.<br/>
About 20 feet from the water house, the trail come to a "T" <br/>
intersection with another trail. Stop at the "T" and look up...you <br/>
should be looking into a large, very old Bamboo Grove. Turn left at <br/>
the "T" and walk about 35 paces. The trail will now start to go right <br/>
(heading back towards the river) and lead you into a shallow ditch. <br/>
On the other side of the ditch is a pile of rocks. From that pile of <br/>
rocks continue down the trail for about 25 paces...then head into the <br/>
Bamboo grove at a heading of 330. About 10-15 feet inside the grove <br/>
you should find a jumble of 3-4 large rocks with a curved tree <br/>
nearby. The letter box is buried between two of the rocks under some <br/>
weeds and old broken bamboo. the area right around the rocks is (or <br/>
was, when we were there) a nice comfortable place to sit and to your <br/>
stamping.<br/>
Please cover it well when you're done, the dried bamboo leaves blow <br/>
off easily...Please throw some heavier stuff on top.<br/>
