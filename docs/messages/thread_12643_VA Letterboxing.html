   Found 10 and Planted 1<br/>
<br/>
I just want to let everyone know that I found the letterbox Seven <br/>
Bends in Woodstock, VA. The day was beautiful and the view from the <br/>
tower was wonderful. We found the box without a problem.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the Shenandoah Vineyards in Edinburg, VA. After we tasted <br/>
the wine like the clues say we went outside to see if we could find <br/>
the box. No luck! At 4:00 we went back inside for the tour and asked <br/>
where the original hybrids were and the lady told us. However, we <br/>
came up empty handed. Does anyone know if this box still exists? I'm <br/>
going to e-mail the planter and let them know that it is missing. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun letterboxing.<br/>

I just wanted to let everyone know that I ended up finding the <br/>
Virginia Wine Series box on May 10.  I also have one of the HH boxes <br/>
which I hope to place on Monday but I won't tell you where. I'm sorry <br/>
that I have been holding on to it for so long but every weekend <br/>
lately it has rained. I'm not addicted enough to go in the rain. <br/>

On June 21st my husband and I set out to wintergreen to attempt the <br/>
boxes there. I was thankful that we finally had a pretty Saturday so <br/>
we could go there. We found Megan's Magpie, Maggie's Mousie, the old <br/>
crow and Emily's Elephant. The boxes that we did find however were in <br/>
fine shape and I even left "The Seeker" HH in one of them. Yes the HH <br/>
is back on the go and waiting for someone to find it. I'm sad to <br/>
report but we could not find Julia's Monkey box and am pretty sure <br/>
that we were in the right spot. The discouraging part about not being <br/>
able to find this box was I know it was found the weekend before. I <br/>
don't know if it got placed deeper or if it is missing. My husband <br/>
looked around for the box for a long time to the point he was hitting <br/>
plants with a stick out of frustration. I told him if he was going to <br/>
hti the plants that it was time to go. He said that he wasn't going <br/>
to take a chance of being bit by a snake for the box. Has anyone been <br/>
there since the 21st and found it? We were at the sign and the <br/>
waterfall was on the left so we think it was around there somewhere. <br/>
Oh well. <br/>
<br/>
I also have to report that I planted a box in Bridgewater, VA and got <br/>
e-mail a couple of weeks ago saying that someone found my box. I was <br/>
so excited that it is almost more exciting that finding someone <br/>
else's. I'm trying to say that finding another person's box isn't <br/>
exciting because it is. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that everyone has a nice 4th of July and happy letterboxing.<br/>
