<br/>
However, the weather yesterday was great for a quick letterbox <br/>
checking trip so I hauled my carcaus, broken bones and all, out to <br/>
check on my Kent Trails box. <br/>
<br/>
How fun to find that folks have been stamping in even during <br/>
Decemeber in Michigan! Clues are about half way down the page here: <br/>
http://home.comcast.net/~bindlestiff_boxer/ if you're interested.<br/>
<br/>
We introduced my daughter and her fiance to Letterboxing during the <br/>
holidays.  On her first trip out, she found every box she printed <br/>
clues for plus .... not one, but TWO hitch hikers!  How's that for <br/>
beginners luck? Now they want to stop using store bought stamps and <br/>
start carving their own.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't-cha just love this activity!?!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
