of Baltimore, and made a wrong turn onto I70 and ended up in West<br/>
Virginia.  As luck would have it, I had some UWCB and and old<br/>
pizza cutter in my glovebox, so I managed to put a box out while<br/>
I was there :-).<br/>

<br/>
As always, people are free to link to this clue.  D'oh!  I just <br/>
found out that Dan will be de-listing me from his site.  I guess <br/>
someone will have to figure how to count the states :-)  I will <br/>
address my de-listing in my next post, (per someone else's request), <br/>
entitled "boring" (so you know what its about and can delete it<br/>
if you don't care).<br/>
<br/>
My clues will be available at http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/index.html <br/>
for those interested, regardless of whether Dan changes his mind.<br/>
