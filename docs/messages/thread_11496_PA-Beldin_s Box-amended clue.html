                    <div class="plaintext-content">Please add the following amendment to Beldin's Box Map:<br/>
<br/>
Beldin rested in the tree of three for awhile, hoping his other half <br/>
would eventually wander by.  After some time, he fell into a deep <br/>
sleep after which he gradually awoke to the sound of whispering on <br/>
his right. Cracking open one eye ever so slightly, he saw another <br/>
wizard and 2 companions standing there watching him. They had passed <br/>
his resting spot, and noticed him lying there sleeping.  After some <br/>
discussion, they finally agreed that waking a sleeping wizard would <br/>
be risky indeed. They decided that the wizard, who would refer to <br/>
himself only as "P.J.M.", would wait nearby for Beldin to awake while <br/>
the two companions continued on their own adventure.  Beldin, who was <br/>
pretending he was asleep, fell back asleep for real.  When he awoke <br/>
again, "P.J.M" was no where to be seen. "Oh my", thought Beldin, "My <br/>
dreams are getting stranger all the time. Well, it's probably time to <br/>
start looking for that twin of mine again."<br/>
<br/>
He continued along the trail, crossing the first of the bridges of <br/>
two. At the center of the second bridge, he saw an image of what he <br/>
thought might be his twin up ahead at 328 degrees, standing atop a <br/>
big big rock. Beldin walked through the trees to the BBR, but once he <br/>
arrived, his twin was nowhere to be found. "Maybe I'm imagining these <br/>
things", he thought. He climbed onto the rock, and gazed around to <br/>
see what he can see. He spied a circle at 295 degrees, and a pitched <br/>
pine at 5 degrees, but no sign of his twin. "Yes, I was definitely <br/>
imagining things again. Maybe its time for another nap". <br/>
