rainy days to be able to collect a letterbox stamp from indoors.<br/>
<br/>
Could some of you revisit some of the ideas that were being bandied about last<br/>
summer when this was a hot topic?  Was the general idea to have the contents of<br/>
books be clues?  If so, what happens if the a intended for clues is checked<br/>
out?  Or did I get it right how it is supposed to work?  I may have been asleep<br/>
that day...<br/>

Ps.  When one of you publishes the first Letterbox USA book, it can be part of a<br/>
letterbook hunt at your local library!  ;-)<br/>

One thing that appealed to me was to get a book from the discard pile at<br/>
the library (perhaps from a book sale), hollow it out and put the stamp<br/>
and notebook inside. That way, the library staff doesn't need to store<br/>
the "letterbox" items someplace else. And, for those inclined to sneak<br/>
one into a library without knowledge of the staff (hmmm- maybe not a<br/>
good idea?), it would look like one of the regular items on the shelf<br/>
(call letters on the spine, etc) but would not appear in the<br/>
card/computer catalogue, so it might likely be overlooked for a while<br/>
except by letterbook hunters. <br/>
<br/>
Conceptually I like this idea, but really, its FAR better to work<br/>
cooperatively with your library, as Tom is apparently doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, there were the ideas of fabricating a book jacket, something<br/>
cryptic relating to the hobby,putting it over an old, hollowed-out book<br/>
and getting it placed with cooperation of the library staff.<br/>
<br/>
And then, there was the literary clue-search, requiring one to search<br/>
through several different books to devise the final clue to the location<br/>
- this I'll bet is Tom's approach. <br/>
Hmmmm - another nice reason to go over the mountain. I promise I will<br/>
sometime, Tom. This idea will span the cold season!<br/>

<br/>
That's the method of letterbooking that I remember.  I was just wondering what<br/>
happens if clue #1 reads, "Go to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, page 14."<br/>
but Huckelberry Finn happens to be checked<br/>
out.  Should there be multiple ways to derive the clues so if a<br/>
book that's critical to the clues is checked out there would be an alternative<br/>
way to get the stamp?  Does this make sense?  Or would<br/>
it be OK if you just have to wait or find the book elsewhere?<br/>

&gt;  I agree that it would be better for the project to be carried out<br/>
&gt;  with the blessing of the system, but there is something appealing<br/>
&gt;  about the underground aspect of just putting the art out there.<br/>
&gt;  Theoretically it is the same process as our putting letterboxes<br/>
&gt;  out on public land without permission, but is different in that the <br/>
&gt;  space is so much more limited than the great outdoors. The biggest<br/>
&gt;  concern I'd have is that a hundred people might decide to place <br/>
&gt;  letterbooks in the same library someday. Scary....<br/>
<br/>
Very scary!  Whether we do our Letterboxing in the great outdoors, on the<br/>
shelves of libraries, or behind the bar at our favorite local taverns, the<br/>
concept does not change very much.  We must always be careful not to over-<br/>
saturate any given area with boxes.  Letterboxing should not be an Easter egg<br/>
hunt... it should be more like a rare, exotic treasure hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Thom and I have discussed the fact that the Rock Creek area is nearing the<br/>
saturation point. (in more ways than one, thanks to these never-ending rains<br/>
we've been getting - ha!)  There are probably a few more spots worth<br/>
considering, but soon we will reach the point were we will need to focus our<br/>
efforts elsewhere.  It's no fun if there are letterboxes in every nook, cranny<br/>
and crevise you look into.  This would  "cheapen" the public's perception of<br/>
the hobby.  <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is a game of respect. Respect for the artists who create the work<br/>
within, and for the places in which the letterboxes are hidden.  We must<br/>
choose our locations wisely.<br/>

Once when I was in  ENgland, a friend of mine took me to see the library <br/>
at Cambridge University.  We had to sign a paper saying I was there to <br/>
look at the architecture, and that I wouldn't read any books -- no joke!  <br/>
Non-university people really AREN'T supposed to use the library...<br/>
<br/>
But the thing that really blew me away was the card catalog.  This was a <br/>
few years ago, but not more than 7 or 8, and the card catalog was not <br/>
yet on computer (well, I think maybe the NEWEST books were on <br/>
computer).  The catalog consisted mainly of huge bound books, into which <br/>
librarians pasted little hand-written notices of where the books are, <br/>
leaving space in between the cards for insertion of cards for books <br/>
purchased later.  It was a medieval system!<br/>
<br/>
They don't use Dewey decimal or Library of Congress, they have their own <br/>
system, and it is tremendously arcane.  Books are categorized by what <br/>
rooms they are in, which may or may not have to do with subject matter, <br/>
and the books in each room are number differently.  It is VERY difficult <br/>
for the average student to find things, and the librarians set up little <br/>
clue searches just like you were describing.  When you find the <br/>
first book, it tells you to look up a second book but you have to go <br/>
through the baffling system to find it.  Don't know what they do to <br/>
prevent the books involved from being removed, but maybe they only put <br/>
clues in books nobody has checked out since the time of Isaac Newton (oh, <br/>
wait, he was in Oxford...or was he?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm mostly writing to say good-bye.  Hey, that message is only <br/>
vaguely, tangentially associated with letterboxing -- that's a clue.  I'm <br/>
afraid I just don't have time to keep up with the list traffic -- you <br/>
folks are prolific! -- and I'm quite ashamed of how lax I've been about <br/>
upholding my responsibilities as California rep on the letterboxing map <br/>
(actually, I've asked to be removed from that).  I got to go on vacation <br/>
this year, for the  first time in 3 years, and we did go to England, but <br/>
couldn't get to Dartmoor.  But somehow, when  you come back from <br/>
vacation, there's even MORE to do.  I just don't have time for letterboxing, <br/>
over here or over there or anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Problem: I can't find anything that tells me how to get off of this mailing <br/>
list.  Sorry to be such a dim bulb, here, but I guess I wiped off <br/>
whatever mail I had about list business like unsubbing.  Could somebody <br/>
wipe me off of the list, or clue me in?<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, y'all, I'm sure I'll be back, maybe in the summer,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm enjoying the discussion of letterbooks a lot, and thought I'd <br/>
share a little of what I'm doing at our library.<br/>
<br/>
It really makes sense to me to involve the librarians. Randolph is a <br/>
small town, and I have known the librarians for many years. They are <br/>
all enthusiastic about letterboxing and letterbooking, and this will <br/>
help immensely in promoting the hobby here. There will be an <br/>
informational sheet on letterboxing on both the upstairs (adult) and <br/>
downstairs (children) bulletin boards, and a copy of the Smithsonian <br/>
magazine in which our article appeared. The library has a couple of <br/>
computers hooked up to the Internet, and Letterbox USA will be <br/>
bookmarked.<br/>
<br/>
In this first letterbook, which has some difficult clues, the <br/>
librarians will have sheets with easier sets of clues to give out on <br/>
request (two easier levels). They will also have envelopes with <br/>
needed information/materials from the books involved to give to <br/>
searchers if any of these books should be checked out. The final <br/>
(hollow) book, in which the stamp and journal are hidden, will be in <br/>
the library, but hidden in such a fashion that it will never be <br/>
checked out. I don't want to say just how that is arranged.<br/>
<br/>
The first level of clues (the hardest) is aimed at middle-level kids <br/>
(grades 5 - 8), who like problem solving. Even with the easier clues, <br/>
this will likely be too hard for younger children. I look forward to <br/>
creating some easier ones later on in the winter.<br/>
<br/>
One approach would be to give out only one clue initially, which <br/>
would lead to a book containing the next clue. In this case, I have <br/>
listed all the clues, in order to give searchers a head start on some <br/>
of the decoding; there might not be time to do it all in an hour or <br/>
two at the library. <br/>
<br/>
It's possible to figure out a lot of the puzzle from the given <br/>
clues, but there is also a final puzzle at the end which requires <br/>
being in the library and having gotten your hands on the books <br/>
themselves. This final activity is, I think, the best part of the <br/>
quest, and very much in the spirit of letterBOXing. So while the <br/>
clues given could all be unraveled without ever leaving your <br/>
computer, this is not just a cyber-adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Since the letterbook is not yet in place, I haven't posted clues on <br/>
the Vermont/Randolph page yet. But you can access it at the following <br/>
address on Dan's site:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/kimball.htm<br/>
<br/>
I invite any of you who are interested to identify the five books <br/>
cached in the clues, and to decode the two encrypted sections. Please <br/>
send answers or spoiler-type questions to me off-list. I will let you <br/>
know if you get them right (and the list, unless you ask me not to). <br/>
I will also send you copies of the easier clues on request.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are probably not yet in their final form, so your input <br/>
will be helpful!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

a couple of list people close enough who do.<br/>
<br/>
I'll write to you off-list and tell you how it works for this book.<br/>

 That's the method of letterbooking that I remember.  I was just wondering<br/>
what<br/>
 happens if clue #1 reads, "Go to The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, page<br/>
14."<br/>
 but Huckelberry Finn happens to be checked<br/>
 out.  Should there be multiple ways to derive the clues so if a<br/>
 book that's critical to the clues is checked out there would be an<br/>
alternative<br/>
 way to get the stamp?  Does this make sense?  Or would<br/>
 it be OK if you just have to wait or find the book elsewhere?<br/>
<br/>
 Dan &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can't begin to imagine the work involved but I have 2 thoughts: One, it<br/>
would be part of the thrill (anticipation!!) for me to have to WAIT (even be<br/>
put on a WAITING LIST at the library) to get the proper book(s)...BUT<br/>
Two, somehow, somewhere, the same clue could be obtained from more than one<br/>
book... if Huck Finn ain't there, try The Secret Garden page 99.... and so on<br/>
LOL Some books' clues may be more easily interpreted than others, but all<br/>
point to the same place????<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like WORK!!!  <br/>

     Ideally you could use a work in the reference section...say, Barlett's<br/>
or something similar. Always there, always available.  This is certainly a<br/>
prolific group.<br/>
     There be letterboxes in CT if anyone's interested, down in the<br/>
Mystic/New London/casino area.  The local EMS store at Crystal Mall in<br/>
Waterford CT is acting at the clearing house for clues.  At last count<br/>
there were 8 letterboxes in this area, although one has already been<br/>
tampered with and may not have been replaced yet.<br/>
     No one here has taken to carving their own stamps yet.  Does anyone<br/>
have any pointers, help, etc., for doing this?  Also the idea of<br/>
letterbooking is new to me but again sounds interesting and<br/>
challenging...details, please if anyone has time.<br/>

Letterbooking is new to all of us Ray.  As for hand carving stamps try the<br/>
Letterbox USA page at http://www.pclink.com/elf<br/>
and click on Getting Started and #1) a stamp.<br/>
Also feel free to ask specific questions to the group.  There are lots of stamp<br/>
carvers in our group who will give input.<br/>
<br/>
I've been to Bridgeport, Waterbury and Terryville, CT as well as City Island, NY<br/>
which is just south of Bridgeport.  Where is Waterford in relation to one of<br/>
these places?<br/>

at any rate i hope to have my letterbox out this weekend coming, at the<br/>

      Waterford is on the coast (I95) just outside of New London, which is<br/>
the last sizable city before you cross into Rhode Island heading north.  If<br/>
I can be of help to any of the group interested in stamping up down this<br/>
way let me know.<br/>

Just a guess, but I'll bet everyone on the list would be thrilled if<br/>
you participate by publishing to our site.  Its free.  Its non-profit.<br/>
And its the best bunch of people you ever will meet (as far as you can meet<br/>
people through the internet).  Contact me privately if you are interested.  If I<br/>
put your information on the site I will let everyone know where to find it.<br/>
Welcome aboard.  Letterboxing is the best thing since sliced bread!<br/>
