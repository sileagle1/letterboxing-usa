                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spent yesterday afternoon down at the local constabulary trying to <br/>
explain away the public decency's law's against the arrival of our <br/>
new, heart stopping, "Peep Show" (by Natty Bumpo). Much to my <br/>
complete embarassment, members of the press were present, along with <br/>
local representatives of the Ladies Auxillary with their own <br/>
objections. After private consultations with some of the <br/>
authorities, that involved the exchange of several free passes, a <br/>
loophole was discovered and we shall be allowed to proceed. Not <br/>
before we gained priceless free publicity. ["But Boss, I don't see <br/>
nothin'." "Hush, you fool!"] Still, receiving a rating of PG-13, I <br/>
thought was pretty heavy handed.  <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the curious public, I returned to our camp to discover <br/>
the arrival of the "Amazing Tattooed Woman" (by Kreepy Kelli) <br/>
surrounded by shocked "Sideshow Gawkers" (by Drew Clan). She is <br/>
truly a marvel to behold, so I cannot blame their admiration. These <br/>
gawkers are so two faced though. Rotate them 180 degrees and they <br/>
show a completely different side of themselves. You won't believe <br/>
your eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Last week I carved myself a new top hat and tails for <br/>
my "Ringmaster" outfit (by Scarab). I was quite pleased with the <br/>
affect if I do say so myself. <br/>
<br/>
Recently I was lucky enough to preview our fine "Elephant and Boch's <br/>
Circus Banner" (by Tempus Fugit). In her new finery she is simply <br/>
splendid. Ready to lead our parade down Main Street. Everyone will <br/>
come out and follow us.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of the parade I have completed new carving and repainting <br/>
of our "Steam Caliope Wagon" (by Scarab). They will hear us coming!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of coming, both "Madame Natascha: the Black Widow" (by <br/>
Gallant Rogue), and our "Juggler" (by Music Woman), came by train. I <br/>
was very amused to watch the train station crowd separate themselves <br/>
into one crowd of women and children, and another of gentlemen. You <br/>
can guess which was which. For myself I could not help but admire <br/>
the amazing quality of both performances. <br/>
<br/>
My partner, gather host, and inimitable elephant trainer, Tempus <br/>
Fugit, accompanied by Night Owl, recently ran dress rehearsals, <br/>
planting most of the sideshow acts in another location of the MD <br/>
Black Hills.  Dress rehearsals continue.  <br/>
<br/>
I have heard from many who are still getting their performances <br/>
together or are in transit. Rumors of the arrival of the "Fish Girl" <br/>
are rampant. I myself tingle with not knowing precisely what to <br/>
expect. It is with excited anticipation that I await more arrivals. <br/>
Many thanks for all efforts. <br/>
<br/>
Steam up the caliope!<br/>
<br/>
Yours most truly, your sincere, humble Ringmaster,<br/>
Phineas Boch<br/>
Apologies if my addled brain repeats itself redundantly.<br/>

<br/>
Certainly we would be most gratified to have the lovely Lady <br/>
Prisspot grace our humble entertainment with her graciousness as our <br/>
esteemed guest.  If she perhaps brought a performance we would be <br/>
excited beyond measure.  I would invite her to plant in the ring or <br/>
find a special place to plant in our side performances.  Perhaps she <br/>
will attend incognito.  <br/>
