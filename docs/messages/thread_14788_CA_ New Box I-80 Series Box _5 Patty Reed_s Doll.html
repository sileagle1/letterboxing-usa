                    <div class="plaintext-content"> The first book I remember reading more than once (for pleasure) was in <br/>
second grade: "Patty Reed's Doll". It told of one of the children in the ill-fated <br/>
Donner party, Martha F. (Patty) Reed. Even when the journey to California <br/>
became so arduous, the adults began dropping their precious cargo on the trail to <br/>
lighten their load, Patty secretly kept her little doll in her pocket. The <br/>
doll survived the journey (so did Patty), something a full half of the party <br/>
could not boast. The site of this box is a monument and museum commemorating this <br/>
incredible journey.<br/>

Clues: a little tricky<br/>
Difficulty: a nice, level 10-15 minute walk on a loop trail<br/>
Caution: In winter, snowy conditions will make this box impossible to reach<br/>
<br/>
To the box: Go to the Donner Memorial State Park and park in the parking lot <br/>
(free). Find the monument to the Donner Party and count the faces in the <br/>
statue. Mulitply this number by 3. There is a lovely loop trail which leads from <br/>
the museum. There are stakes numbering from 1 to 17 on the trail. Go to the <br/>
stake with the number you figured out. Just to the left of this stake, take the <br/>
trail east through the meadow, about 97 paces. There you'll see a large, granite <br/>
rock which seems out of place with all this greenery around. On the west side <br/>
of this rock, under a rock of reddish hue, you will find the Patty Reed's <br/>
Doll letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
Go ahead and continue on this trail the rest of the way around and stand in <br/>
awe at the huge rock with it's commemorative plaque erected in 1919 on the site <br/>
of the cabin where the Donner Party lived and died throughout that harsh and <br/>
fateful winter.<br/>
