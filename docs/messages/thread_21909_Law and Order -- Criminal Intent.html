                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was watching L&amp;O last night.  The plot revolved around geocaching<br/>
and letterboxing.  (I think Hollywood has trouble understanding the<br/>
difference)  A geo-cacher was being framed for murder.  The murderer<br/>
planted evidence near a geo-cache to incriminate the suspect.  The<br/>
detective had to solve the clues to figure out where the cache was so<br/>
the surrounding area could be searched for evidence.  I thought it was<br/>
neat, that our hobbies are being noticed by the mainstream media. <br/>
Now, if one of us was to find a finger in a letterbox... <br/>

I'm not sure that I agree with you on this. The more mainstream media <br/>
knows about letterboxing, the more this hobby will be affected. One of <br/>
the interesting things about Letterboxing is the secrecy, and <br/>
underground aspect of the hobby. Publicity isn't always a good thing.<br/>
