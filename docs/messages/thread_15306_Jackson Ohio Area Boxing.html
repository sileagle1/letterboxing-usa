Finders and Just Passin Through, then Order in the Court (after <br/>
creeping around the courthouse trying to look inconspicuous while <br/>
wearing a flourescent green T-shirt---poor choice of attire on my <br/>
part). Also found Sacred Symbol, Leo, and Leo Too. No luck finding <br/>
Political Graveyard, Hero's Rest or the Ridgewood Flower but very <br/>
interesting cemeteries all the same! It got dark before I could get <br/>
To Lake Alma so that particular adventure will have to wait for <br/>
another day. Thanks to Bigguy, Scoutdogs and Franzsolo for planting <br/>
great boxes!         Salamander <br/>
