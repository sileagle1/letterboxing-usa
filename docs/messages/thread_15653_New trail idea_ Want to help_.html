Not having grown up in this country, I must confess that I would like to lay <br/>
claim to "RUPERT" and would be inclined to relive some of his wonderful <br/>
adventures. I have two glorious books from the DAILY EXPRESS series, one <br/>
dated '72 and the other '78.  <br/>

Wouldn't it be fun to put together a trail of our favorite children's<br/>
books? It could be a lot of fun to see the diverse selections. Hopefully<br/>
it might even inspire a few trips to the library or book store. <br/>
<br/>
RTRW &amp; SKW already said they were putting a box together  "Blueberries<br/>
for Sal" <br/>
<br/>
I have a trail in mind and if you would like to contribute a box please<br/>
let me know. <br/>

We'd love to help, but can't decide on a book.  There are so many to <br/>
choose from!  How to choose just one?  Definately count us in, and <br/>
we'll manage to narrow down the field.<br/>

Hi Irishtinker,<br/>
hope i'm not too late to contribute a stamp for your children's book <br/>
series.<br/>
'Tarka The Otter' is a classic English children's book based on a <br/>
true story, not sure how well known this book is 'State Side'.<br/>
Author Henry Williamson became enthralled with the wild scenery of <br/>
Devon during a summer holiday.<br/>
He later returned to live in an idyllic North Devon thatched cottage <br/>
with his strange family of dogs, cats, gulls, buzzards, magpies and <br/>
one otter cub that were free to come and go as they chose.<br/>
It was the otter cub which stimulated him to write 'Tarka the Otter'.<br/>
He rescued it after its mother had been shot by a farmer, and <br/>
persuading his cat to suckle it along with her kitten.<br/>
Eventually the otter cub became domesticated and became Henry's <br/>
constant companion.<br/>
<br/>
By coincidence, the book fits nicely in with Letterboxing as Tarka <br/>
spent much of his life on the river Taw.<br/>
High up on Dartmoor the source of the river is within one half mile <br/>
from the fabled Cranmere Pool letterbox, the first letterbox ever.<br/>
To view the present letterbox, which is still much visited go to<br/>
http://www.richni.co.uk/dartmoor/cranmere.htm<br/>
<br/>
Hope I haven't given too much of the story line away!<br/>
Best of luck with the project irishtinker<br/>
If you would like this stamp, just send details for snail mailing.<br/>
Regards<br/>
AKA Squeeeezebox<br/>
