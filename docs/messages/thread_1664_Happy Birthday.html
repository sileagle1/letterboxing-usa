                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here is a great idea! A local family who got the letterboxing bug <br/>
from me just reported the success of a letterboxing birthday party.  <br/>
Each guest recieved a goody bag with a rubber stamp and pad in it.  <br/>
Then with parent chaperones they headed out planning to do two <br/>
Mansfield boxes. Well after several they were convinced that due to <br/>
darkness they had to quit for the day. All the kids really got into <br/>
the fun. Invitations asked guests to dress for hiking. What a great <br/>
idea and it keeps the house intact too.   If even a couple of the <br/>
kids at that party become regulars just imagine how things can <br/>
multiply.  A few more parties in town and we will be  really <br/>
spreading the word.   I also gave out ready to plant boxes as gifts <br/>
recently. It will give me some to hunt for and help spread the <br/>
enthusiasm.  Carol in watching the weather in Ct.<br/>
