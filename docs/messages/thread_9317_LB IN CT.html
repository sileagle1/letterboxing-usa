yo , Letterboxer 2001. just thought you might like to know that Bluebird
and I just so happened to meet the Kneedeeps today on the Mountain that 
Chuck fell off. !--Nice Stamp in my book !!!<span class="moz-smiley-s3"><span>
;-) </span></span><br/>
Chuck,  so happy to hear you are mending.  Today in a log book,  we noticed
your stamp missing all of a sudden, and even noted it in the next log book.
Oh, now I feel soooo bad that you had such a fall as we went merrily on our
way thinking that you just got tired and left !!  I just got home and Carol[leader
of the pack] wrote me CHUCK FELL !!  We met her after the mountain and  did
Irish Tinker's Christmas Around the World.  Those stamps are really great
, and a nice easy walk after that  climb.<br/>
