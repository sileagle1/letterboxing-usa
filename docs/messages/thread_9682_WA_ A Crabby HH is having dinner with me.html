I made a return attack to Pt Defiance in Tacoma to tackle Trial and <br/>
Errors Gnome series.  After a little consult with DVN2R SKR I decided <br/>
to use a marker ( pen on the back of my hand)to help with counting.  <br/>
With so many things to see ( mushrooms are popping everywhere and the <br/>
birds were mighty happy to have a dry day) I keep loosing count.<br/>
<br/>
It worked!  I found the Crabby Hitchhiker still with Gwendolyn.  She <br/>
still has her happy smile and is prim and neat in her skirt.  All of <br/>
the Gnomes have neat tidy homes and all are snug and dry.<br/>
<br/>
I love when Amanda brings us new HH's from the far flung places.  It <br/>
is great to see new stamps for people and places you have only heard <br/>
of; the Psychokiwis, Chickabirdie, Chuck and Molly, The Haunted Trail <br/>
and of course Pete and Wanda.<br/>
<br/>
Crabby HH came home with me.  I am treating him to Dungeness Crab ( <br/>
first of the season)Dinner before sending him on his way.<br/>

So, Crabby's a cannibal, I take it???  ;)  Or is he really of the <br/>
dungeness kind?  We'll keep our eyes out for a hitchhiker with a few <br/>
nibbles taken out of it...<br/>
