<br/>
THE MARSH<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
Find the Oak Island Parks and Rec. Center. <br/>
<br/>
Park your car next to the Building and Head behind the swings to <br/>
the "Overlook Trail"<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail and Keep your eyes out for wild creatures.<br/>
<br/>
Pass "Mr. Black". He loves his "Gum", but doesn't blow bubbles.<br/>
Look to your right at the wetlands. Perhaps you'll see a marsh <br/>
rabbit, or a Skink.<br/>
<br/>
When you reach the bottom of the trail find the Bridge ahead and to <br/>
your right.<br/>
<br/>
Cross it.<br/>
<br/>
Continue to your right and before the next bridge in the clump of <br/>
trees to your left you'll find your box held between two twin pines.<br/>
<br/>
This trail is busy and popular. So please make sure you are not seen <br/>
taking it out or replacing it.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your search and enjoy Oak Island.<br/>
