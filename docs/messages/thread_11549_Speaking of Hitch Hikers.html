Yes, the renowned Wand and Pete keep a HitchHiker tracking list for just that <br/>
purpose. Of course, someone has to let them know, or at least post the info to <br/>
the Talk List. Anyway, e-mail them at wandaandpete@yahoo.com and they'll <br/>
direct you to the list.<br/>

I'm with you on that!  I realize that boxing is a bit slow here in my <br/>

I agree! Some of my boxes are like that, and it seems to increase the chance<br/>
of survival. I especially like the bags with the zipper on top - folk are<br/>
much more likely to seal the bag properly because it is easy to do. The<br/>
blue-zipper freezer bags are particularly good because they're slightly<br/>
thicker plastic. <br/>

I know when we find a HH (which is very seldom, but...) we love to look at <br/>
the logbook and see where it has been.  It's fun to see who carried it from <br/>
where to where and any comments they may have.  It's too bad the postcards <br/>
couldn't be dittos -- one mailing to the planter and the other copy staying <br/>
with the HH for the finders to read.  BeMa<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since so few people seem interested in letting the creator know of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their whereabouts. For me, that's (or would have been) a major part<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fun: knowing where my little stamps have traveled.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm with you on that!  I realize that boxing is a bit slow here in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; part of the world, but even those that have been placed in other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; states, where the log books indicated a more regular stream of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; visitors, have never again been heard from... (not in e-mail or on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the P&amp;W HH list).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; One of the things I like about this hobby is going out every so often<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; for most of the boxes I have placed out of state, I have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fortunate to get e-mail updates when they are found.  Not so with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; HH's.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I echo your sentiments...  There isn't much incentive to put out a<br/>

Irish - Sounds like a good idea. I found a funhog HH at the Eagleville Dam, and immediately e-mailed funhog with the trek as I figured it from Hawaii to Cape Cod, Lee, Mass and then Conn. However, many entries did not give a location... Any snow this weekend? Snowbird<br/>

Funhog - I just referred to your great Aloha stamp in response above. Have you heard back since I replanted it in Ohio?? I have to keep my own log book, as I don't always remember where I replanted a HH.    Mostly because I take it along  and often encounter micro boxes (thanks alot Franzsolo) and have to trek on. Easy Breeze contends that a HH does not have to be in the host box. However, it is fun to put it in a large enough host box to ensure its discovery. Snowbird <br/>

&gt; Yes, the renowned Wand and Pete keep a HitchHiker tracking list for<br/>
just that <br/>
&gt; purpose. Of course, someone has to let them know, or at least post<br/>
the info to <br/>
