What? You don't have battery-powered Black-N-Decker leaf blower/yard<br/>
vac/hair dryer!? Hahahaha....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am annoyed at people who put bags around the outsides of boxes! It <br/>
&gt; just makes the water problem worse. I now use Lock n- Lock <br/>
&gt; containers <br/>
<br/>
While I can certainly see the benefits of the secure water-tight seal,<br/>
I have to wonder about the very thin plastic hinges that keep the lid<br/>
on. Have you (or anyone else) ever seen one that was broken? Once just<br/>
one of the four hinges breaks, the water-tight properties are gone.<br/>
<br/>
The price kinda turns me away, too...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have found boxes with the logbook double bagged, the stamp double <br/>
&gt; bagged, then everything in a bigger outer bag, and then the outer <br/>
&gt; container. I think this is overkill. While I am careful to close all <br/>
<br/>
Definitely overkill. If fate has decided to get the box wet, it's<br/>
going to get wet. I'm particular about double-bagging logbooks though,<br/>
just in case. The most bags I've ever used: 3<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As for disappearing ink, I have a soaked logbook right here ...<br/>
&gt; ... pages were recovered. stamp image ... SpudHund clear as ...<br/>
&gt; could be ... WINK's ... Tarheel's signature stamps ... <br/>
&gt; obliterated... except for the "tar" spot on Tarheel's image. I will <br/>
&gt; find out what each of them used.<br/>
<br/>
Real tar? Wow. Thinking about this scientifically, we have to consider<br/>
factors other than just the ink. For example, the kind of paper used:<br/>
was it a thick, absorbent card stock or craft paper meant to hold on<br/>
to ink, or was it a smooth-finish paper meant for high-speed copiers?<br/>
One other thing to consider is the length of time the paper was wet:<br/>
did the water just flow right through the box, leaving wet paper from<br/>
which the moisture would eventually evaporate... or did the water<br/>
flood the box and stay in there?<br/>
<br/>
An interesting experiment...<br/>
