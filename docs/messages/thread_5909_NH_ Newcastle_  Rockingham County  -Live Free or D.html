The New Hampshire Seacoast is alive with history and we share a piece <br/>
with you through this letterbox. Long ago New Hampshire residents <br/>
coined the phrase " Live Free or Die " and now it is on the liscense <br/>
plate of all the NH cars. An everyday reminder to the value given to <br/>
freedom and the price often paid to  defend it. The New Hampshire <br/>
seacoast is valuable in that it is the home port for the Portsmouth <br/>
Shipyard. From colonial times when gunpowder was stolen from the <br/>
Brittish here to use at Bunker Hill to the Uboat nets from WWII, <br/>
through the closing of Fort Constitution for awhile after 9/11 the  <br/>
seacoast has been defended. <br/>
    To find the Live Free or Die letterbox travel to Rye New <br/>
Hampshire and take Rte 1-A  from 1-A turn onto Rte 1-B Wentworth  Rd. <br/>
You will drive by the old Wentworth By The Sea hotel now under <br/>
restoration. Down the road slowly now as it narrows look for an  <br/>
unmarked sidestreet on the right with stonewall at the entrance . <br/>
Drive in  this road through a neighborhood of estates. At the end the <br/>
road  comes into the parking area for Fort Stark. In early years it <br/>
was defense for   Portsmouth  and then in WWII  they built the fort <br/>
to resemble a ship when viewed from sea as a lure to U Boats so they <br/>
would run aground. It  was a worthy plan never tested.  <br/>
    Park your car and proceed to the flagpole. From here turn toward <br/>
the water and climb either set of stairs. No place more emphasizes <br/>
our past defenses than this old fort. At the top of the Bunker , <br/>
note  Whaleback light to  the front and Fort Constitution to the <br/>
left. Turn right on the mowed path. Follow the chain link fence  <br/>
along the path. Follow to an end where you will see the Science <br/>
Center at Odiorne Point State Park. Stop here you want to look for  <br/>
oil and eight.  When you have found that  look nearby for  a square <br/>
within a square with a survey marker on it. In the inner square  you  <br/>
will find your  letterbox. Stamp privately and return the box to its <br/>
hole. As you follow the path onward it will wind pass bunkers and <br/>
back to your car. Remember those who defend our country. <br/>
