opinions. i have taking all day to think about this and i have <br/>
decided this:<br/>
<br/>
the placer of the HH had writin in the log book to report back to <br/>
them about the whereabouts of the HH. I did that this past sunday, <br/>
not mentioning which HH it was or where it was so i would get a <br/>
responce back. to this day i have not heard a peep from this person. <br/>
i plan on giving this person until next wednesday to mail me back, <br/>
and if at that time i do not hear back, i will concider the HH <br/>
abandoned and adopt it as my own. also i will acknowledge the box as <br/>
originating from the creature and its birth place from which it <br/>
started. there may be some of you that will not like this decision, <br/>
but the fact of the matter is, which has been stated in the past few <br/>
days, that may boxers start LBing and quicky loose interest. which <br/>
means abandoned boxes, HH, and whatever else. I live thankfully in <br/>
the small state of new hampshire and the LBers i have talked to and <br/>
hope to meet soon, have greeted me with open arms. It should be <br/>
about time the rest of the country does the same. opinions are not <br/>
facts. stop making those with opinions feel like they are wrong. <br/>
this is a hobby, not a game. this is an adventure, not a <br/>
competition. im not sorry for my agressive post earlier, but i am <br/>
sorry for those poor poor soals like springchick, who make someone <br/>

&gt; &gt; again, all of you must have a hard time reading what i am <br/>
writing. <br/>
&gt; &gt; it's not like it was in code or something. all i did was ask a <br/>
&gt; &gt; simple question, and look for opinions. i recieved more crap <br/>
then <br/>
&gt; &gt; opinions. i have taking all day to think about this and i have <br/>
&gt; &gt; decided this:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; the placer of the HH had writin in the log book to report back <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; them about the whereabouts of the HH. I did that this past <br/>
sunday, <br/>
&gt; &gt; not mentioning which HH it was or where it was so i would get a <br/>
&gt; &gt; responce back. to this day i have not heard a peep from this <br/>
person. <br/>
&gt; &gt; i plan on giving this person until next wednesday to mail me <br/>
back, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and if at that time i do not hear back, i will concider the HH <br/>
&gt; &gt; abandoned and adopt it as my own. also i will acknowledge the <br/>
box as <br/>
&gt; &gt; originating from the creature and its birth place from which it <br/>
&gt; &gt; started. there may be some of you that will not like this <br/>
decision, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but the fact of the matter is, which has been stated in the past <br/>
few <br/>
&gt; &gt; days, that may boxers start LBing and quicky loose interest. <br/>
which <br/>
&gt; &gt; means abandoned boxes, HH, and whatever else. I live thankfully <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the small state of new hampshire and the LBers i have talked to <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; hope to meet soon, have greeted me with open arms. It should be <br/>
&gt; &gt; about time the rest of the country does the same. opinions are <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; &gt; facts. stop making those with opinions feel like they are wrong. <br/>
&gt; &gt; this is a hobby, not a game. this is an adventure, not a <br/>
&gt; &gt; competition. im not sorry for my agressive post earlier, but i <br/>
am <br/>
&gt; &gt; sorry for those poor poor soals like springchick, who make <br/>
someone <br/>
&gt; &gt; like me, with a simple question, snap!<br/>
