to put our clues in circulation again, they were never put on the "what's new" page and being a set of mystery boxes, needed to feel like we had publicized them a little more.  Thanks for

02</div> <div align="center">By: Mike and Jody</div> <div> </div> <div>     Once upon a time, in a commonwealth where the carriage of the Dukes of Hazzard lay down the arms of the South in a court of law, there resided three lonely princes who had come to this new world years before seeking to expand their family holdings.  They settled in the mountains of this region, for where else do royals build their castles?  Unfortunately for them, the commoners wanted nothing to do with monarchs or their ilk, and chased the princes from their resplendent homes.  Fortunately for the princes, they managed to evade the mobs and flee deep into the wilds.  As the years passed, the memory of these princes began to fade from the collective consciousness of the people, until eventually not even the old wives could tell the tale.</div> <div>     Why is this important, you ask?  Why should you care?  It is quite simple, actually.  The thrill of discovery, the joy of adventure.  For you see, I have happened upon old documents that detail the last days of these three princes, and which contain clues as to their final resting places.  If upon reading this, your heart begins to quail and your knees knock, then read no further for you are clearly not the adventuring kind.  If, however, you rise to the challenge of the hunt, and desire to know more, then dear friend, read on, for I have distilled the pertinent positives and negatives from the ancient scrolls and placed them herein.</div> <div>     It seems that as the years passed, and the population increased, these three princes in hiding were herded by the advance of civilization out of their initial refuges into close proximity.  Then, in 1963, a major change in the local geography made the princes make one final run for their lives.  It seems that all three had settled in a beautiful valley that was to be flooded by the Appalachian Power Company.  As the waters rose all around them, the princes slowly crept up the mountains, keeping just one step above the water level, for by now they were advanced in age and feeling the weight of the years pressing down on them.  Eventually, the water stopped rising, and a lake was formed.  This lake was a jewel of a lake, the second largest body of freshwater in the state, with sparkling azure water surrounded by beautiful wilderness.  Time passed yet again, and the princes grew comfortable, now within a 6 mile radius of each other, each gazing out onto the water.</div> <div>     Eventually, the state decided that such a pristine parcel of land should be enjoyed by all, and the majority of the land was designated a state park, and named that park after the lake which was the centerpiece.  As you enter the park in search of the legend of three, make sure that you get a map and additional information, not necessarily out of need, but maybe also as proof to others that you did indeed make it this far.   An entrance fee of $4.00 per vehicle (Subject to change by the state) is required by authorities for the privilege of spending time here. Whether you take some time to explore this area before or after your search, or decide instead to just bull on through, pay heed to your surroundings, and appreciate the beauty of this land.</div> <div>     Immediately after entering the park, you will be given a choice as to which direction to go.  Choose wisely, and use your map to interpret the way, else you will spend a long, but pleasant, drive away from the princes.  Once you have chosen, stay the course, do not stray or be distracted by alternate routes, for they too will take you away from the Three and into the arms of the savages who still dwell in the forests.  Once safely past this danger, continue on your way until you reach a point where beaten trails converge on your chosen road from either side.  Here you must dismount your carriage in the charge of Galapagos if you are to have any chance of surprising the first two princes while they rest.</div> <div>     Using your keen sense of direction, augmented of course by your trusty compass, seek the first prince to the north.  You will immediately be presented another dilemma, as there will be two paths for you to choose.  If your conscience is clear, and your intentions right, you cannot fail to choose correctly.  Wander down this trail, enjoying the scenery that you pass, and soon you will reach a conservation blind, which, if you are in the mood, is an excellent place to sit and watch the wildlife.  Further down the trail, you will come upon a lucky marker.  To be sure you are in the correct spot, find the giant "V" on the right hand side of the trail.  Thus assured, continue down the path you have chosen until you must choose again your route.  The only way to the prince lies down through the woods and over the wood.  Upon touching the soil once again, surrounded by water on all sides, follow your path to the right.  Scan the horizon as you walk this trail, for as a marker you must find the gray-green water tower on the far side of the lake.  When you are looking at said tower on an azimuth of 280 degrees magnetic, directly in line with a small bench directly in front of you, stand fast, your first search is almost complete.  From that spot, you must then face directly North.  About 6 ft to your front will be a large oak tree.  Creep stealthily to this tree, utilize your compass once more to direct you to 45 degrees magnetic and spot a smaller oak tree about 15 ft to your front.  To ensure that no other with ill intention will disturb the remains of the first of Three, discretion is called for as you move to this tree, behind which you will find what you seek.  Ensure that what is left of the prince is returned from whence it came, else his restless spirit may haunt you forever.</div> <div>     Having completed the first part of the quest, make your way back along the trail, staying to the right at every turn, until you arrive once more at your mode of transportation, as regal or common it may be.  The second, and most stubbornly hidden, prince, lies across the black ribbon past the wooden sign.  Follow the trail, once again enjoying the view, keeping your mind clear, your feet righteous and true.  When the ruins of a paupers hostel is on your left, know that you have chosen correctly.  Follow the trail further down towards the water, shining and inviting you in.  When you reach the section of this path that forces you to choose between returning to your carriage, or forging your way deeper into the wilderness to gaze upon the water, forsake that which brought you and venture deeper into the wild, no matter how narrow the pass.  When you are once again forced to cast your fate in one of two directions, be assured that you cannot choose wrong.  Walk whichever way you will, until you reach at the apex of your journey a small clear outcropping of land.  To be sure that your feet have not failed you, look for the exact spot at which the floating house is at 180 degrees magnetic, and across the lake the water tower is at 320 degrees magnetic.  Know now that your second quest reaches the most difficult stretch, for the second prince was renowned for spurning tradition in order to follow his heart.  From your point on the trail, you must then face 55 degrees magnetic into the forest.  Counting each time either foot touches the ground, mark off 40 paces, and you should find yourself facing a shining pine tree stripped of bark, with a most unnatural "X" made out of nature itself.  Congratulations are not in order yet, for there is still much to do.  Once again let your compass guide you true.  Follow your heart to the tune of 40 degrees magnetic for another 54 paces, and you will find in your path a small dogwood tree directly in front of a trio of trees.  To ensure that you are in the correct location, directly to your right is a large pile of deadfall.  If you are convinced that you have not been led astray, then you will find the resting place of the second of Three in the cradle provided by the trio of trees.  When you have taken from him what you will, replace his casket along with what you have left for him.  Return to the small outcropping, and let yourself wander down the trail you did not choose, returning eventually to your transportation.</div> <div>     The third of the Three was fascinated by the water and settled well past the path of tobacco where he knew the view would be most rewarding.  The path to the third prince is difficult to find unless you know the right way to visit him.  Follow the worn trail to a grassy outcrop of land,  the grass grows tall in these parts and many small guards have been known to attack, so beware.  The scenery is worthy of battle and once you have had your fill, return to the wood line and continue your quest.  The bridge to your treasure is short, so take care and watch your step.  Enjoy the water and the woods and soon you will see a small trail to your left.  At this trail's entrance count 35 paces into the forest along this path.  Turn to your left without losing a step and a thin tree with no life still stands there to your front right.  Take eight paces into the trees and your final prize lies at the base of two smooth barked trees that twist together, underneath a small stone cairn which does not belong in this area.  When you are finished with your communion, place everything where you found it and return to the grassy path that you left.  The rest of the journey is left up to you.  Return the way that you came, follow the grass into mystery, or take the way of the deer back toward the lot from which you came.</div> <div>     And that is all that can be told of the fate of these long lost princes, passing the years in an ironic solitude now that so many pass them by within arms reach, never perceiving the cruel truth.  Perhaps you are the one who may bring some companionship into their lives, letting them know that past transgressions can be forgiven and friendships started anew.  Or is this task too daunting for you, too filled with perils both physical and emotional to be completed?  Only you can decide what happens now.  Thus ends this twisted monologue on the fate of the Three Lost Princes.</div> <div> </div> <div>         </div> <div>     </div></blockquote></body></html>
