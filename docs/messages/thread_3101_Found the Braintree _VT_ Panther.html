                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I spent Saturday morning carving stamps for my wife and 2 kids, and we went<br/>
out to find the 4 Braintree/Randolph boxes. At the end of the day we were<br/>
only 1 for 4, but we had a great day all the same.<br/>
<br/>
The Panther box is in great shape and we added our 4 new stamps to the book.<br/>
What a nice place for a letterbox! The kids climbed up on top of the panther<br/>
for a photo (to be added to my letterboxing journal, next to the Panther<br/>
stamp), and we were off to find Rolling Rock. We spent about two hours<br/>
trying to find it, but came up empty handed. It is SO frustrating to know<br/>
you are near a letterbox and not be able to figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
OK, Tom.  We think we're at the right spot. The only thing we think we can't<br/>
figure out is "Equal the years till man is dead."  Care to offer a hint<br/>
...huh? huh?  (C'mon . . . have pitty on us...we spent two hours with a six<br/>
and three year old walking all over the area).  :)<br/>
<br/>
With the kids getting cranky, we decided to save the other two for another<br/>
day. <br/>
<br/>
I'm so happy to have discovered letterboxing. A great way to spend a day<br/>
outside with the family.<br/>

PS. To all of those waiting to see some letterboxes in Caledonia County<br/>
(VT), please be patient for just a little while longer. I have three planned<br/>
and I'm carving the stamps this week. Since I'm still a newbie and my boxes<br/>
are relatively easy for some of you old-timers, I figured I'd make it worth<br/>
the trip by starting with several boxes at once.<br/>

We'll have to compare panther photos sometime!  Erik took Ben (10) to<br/>
see the stuffed catamount at the Statehouse (or Historical Society?) a<br/>
few days ago.  It made a big impression but might be appropriately<br/>
terrifying for younger ones.<br/>
<br/>
Will try to get out to the bay later this week!<br/>

David, don't feel bad!  I had the same result when I went looking for <br/>
those boxes.  But the Braintree Panther box is fun and a good find.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for boxes that require using the compass but are not <br/>
overly difficult, I'd suggest the two new boxes in Storrs, CT--Great <br/>
Blue Heron and Barn Swallow.  The clues were posted to the list about a <br/>
week ago by Mama Bear and her cubs.<br/>
