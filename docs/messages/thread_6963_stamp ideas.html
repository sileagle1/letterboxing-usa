                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you already have a good hiding location for a letterbox in mind, <br/>
look into the history of the area--either natural history or <br/>
cultural--the internet might be of significant help here.  That <br/>
might inspire you as to ideas for possible stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
What's popular in the area?  A certain type of a tree, an animal <br/>
(bird, mammal, fish, etc), did something significant in history <br/>
happen in that area?  Was electricity discovered there or did the <br/>
Pony Express pass through?  If you've already scoped out the area, <br/>
there might be info signs there describing things that are <br/>
significant in the area--use those to help come up with ideas for <br/>
designing your stamps.  If history is what is big in the area--what <br/>
about an image of whatever event or object that is with a name that <br/>
corresponds to it?<br/>
<br/>
Are you inspired by a book, a children's story, a fairy tale or a <br/>
classic novel?  What about creating a series inspired by that book?  <br/>
What about a movie filmed in the area or an area that reminds you of <br/>
a place in a movie (i.e. Brigadoon or The Sound of Music)?  What <br/>
about a song (classic, rock, jazz, swing) that you like that invokes <br/>
a certain feeling, era, epoch?  What about food that you like?  Or a <br/>
sport that is popular in the area (i.e. Field of Dreams).  That's <br/>
what is so exciting about this sport--you are only limited by your <br/>
imagination!!!  Let it go wild!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As I'm not the best carver in the world, I've tried to come up with <br/>
an animal or a thing important to the area to use as the image for <br/>
the stamp AND ENSURE THAT IT IS EASY ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECREATE IN <br/>
STAMP FORM.  If I couldn't do it in kindergarten, I'm not going to <br/>
be able to carve it today...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, if you can't come up with a series based on where you want to<br/>
place a letterbox, get your inspiration elsewhere.  Anywhere!<br/>
<br/>
Ryan Carpenter has placed an African Safari Series in the Columbia River<br/>
Gorge that is absolutely wonderul and I can promise you there isn't a<br/>
hippotomus (sp?) naturally occurring anywhere in this hemisphere except<br/>
in a zoo as far as I know.  His stamps are brilliant and nabbing them is<br/>
such a fun safari in itself in a very wonderful place.    <br/>
<br/>
Funhog placed a very delightful series called "What's for Dinner" in the<br/>
Balch Creek Area in Portland, Oregon, and it is so much fun to get!!! It<br/>
has nothing to do with the area it's placed in, but I can't even begin<br/>
to tell you what a good time we had hunting for this series.  <br/>
<br/>
You can easily do the same thing, Colleen! These are two examples of a<br/>
series of letterboxes that have nothing to do with where they are<br/>
placed, yet all are coveted stamps that are thoroughly enjoyable to<br/>
stamp into.  <br/>
<br/>
I've often thought (goofy, I know) of placing a "Dental Health" series<br/>
with stamps of teeth, toothbrush and dental floss.  Now where would I<br/>
place those where they are particularly relevant?  <br/>
<br/>
The Dental Hall of Fame is probably in some far off remote city I'll<br/>
never get to, and even if I did, they probably have manicured grounds<br/>
where the landscaping crew would unmercifully confiscate my darlings and<br/>
send them hinter into the netherworld, never to be discovered by<br/>
letterbox lovers and stamped into.  HA!  It's a risk you have to take.<br/>
If I do plant this series ever, it will be closer to home, rather than<br/>
where I imagine any formal dental extravaganza resides.  <br/>
<br/>
So you see, it can be anything.  Be free.  Let your imagination run.<br/>
It's all up to you.  If you place a cool series, eventually letterboxes<br/>
will get around to them.  I'm nearly certain of that.  <br/>
<br/>
It's fun to tie a series into something it relates to (like my Who Let<br/>
the Dogs Out! series placed in Forest Park starting at the Dogwood<br/>
Trailhead). but don't sweat getting things to historically  or<br/>
geographically relate, or what have you, unless you really love that and<br/>
think that will be interesting to letterboxers (which it often is).<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps give you some ideas.  Just let the spirit move you, eh?<br/>
<br/>

As far as the series boxes go - are there clues for each box, or does the first box lead you to the next box?<br/>

box leading to the next is that it needs to be in a place that you <br/>
can get to more often to make sure that there are enough sets of <br/>
directions to lead people from box to box.<br/>
Also, sometimes you might post clues to the first three and in the <br/>
third box have directions to a 4th 'bonus' box or something like <br/>
that.  Everyone has summed it up pretty well.  <br/>
Take another hobby you have an make stamps for it...anything.  I <br/>
think the more creative your ideas..the more interest in the whole <br/>
thing.<br/>
