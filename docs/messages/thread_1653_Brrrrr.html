say we could use a bit of a thaw. It is a well and good to have <br/>
school vacation but if it is to cold to be on the trail. Well today <br/>
is moderating some and I think we should break out the winter woolies <br/>
and force march a bit of trail today. Hope everyone had great <br/>
holidays and are in good health.  I got lots of letterboxing supplies <br/>
this should be a great upcoming season . I also gotthe Joshua's <br/>
trust  walk book  with great descriptions of all their land trust <br/>
properties with excellent  hiking trails . Can't wait to find all the <br/>
nooks and crannies of the  great pieces they have preserved.  Let's <br/>
hear it for the great work all these land trust groups do  and in <br/>
turn enabling our  sport/hobby to flourish.   Happy New Year   Carol- <br/>

    I got Dan the Joshua's Trust book for Christmas.  Isn't it great!  There<br/>
are all kinds of little hiking places around that I never knew about.  Can't<br/>
wait to place or find some letterboxes out there!<br/>
