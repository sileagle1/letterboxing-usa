Winter Boxing With The Kids<br/>
<br/>
Placed:  February 24 , 2005<br/>
By:  Team Mad Dawg<br/>
State: 0hio<br/>
County : Butler<br/>
Town : West Chester<br/>
Number of Boxes:  3<br/>
<br/>
Location:  Brookside Cemetery, West Chester Road, West Chester, <br/>
Butler County, OH<br/>
<br/>
Please bring pen and ink pad<br/>
<br/>
This is a series of 3 boxes just for those car-boxing kids with <br/>
cabin fever and a very short attention span.  Store-bought stamp <br/>
warning!<br/>
<br/>
These have a winter theme and will be in place until the first day <br/>
of spring.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Frosty<br/>
<br/>
Enter the cemetery and go up the hill to the white house.  Go right <br/>
at the fork past the McKinney angel.  Turn left at the next road.  <br/>
Continue to the Denman stone and park.  Right ahead will be a tree <br/>
with a very large open knothole.  Behind the tree at the base Frosty <br/>
is waiting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chilly<br/>
<br/>
Turn right and continue along the road following the curve around to <br/>
the north.  This is the older part of the cemetery.  You will pass <br/>
the Muchmore family.  Continue around the curve past the 2 buildings <br/>
to your left.  Park near the white building to your right.  Behind <br/>
the building by the step under the plantings will be Chilly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Flurry<br/>
<br/>
Now turn right at the next road to the back fence and turn left.   <br/>
Continue until you see the triangular island with very large <br/>
evergreens.  Park by the Keehner stone on your left.  Behind you <br/>
next to the fence will be another large tree with an open space at <br/>
the base.  To the left inside the hole under a large piece of bark <br/>
will be Flurry.<br/>
<br/>
