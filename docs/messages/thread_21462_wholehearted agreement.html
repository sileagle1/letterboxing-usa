Wow, I was keeping track of the posts I wanted to comment on and I <br/>
finally had to stop.  I don't think I have ever had the experience of <br/>
agreeing so completely with so many different people about a response <br/>
to a post.<br/>
<br/>
I very much agree with the sentiments I am hearing.  Letterboxing is <br/>
different things to different people, and there are varied elements <br/>
of it that I love.  I haven't been able to decide what it is "all <br/>
about" for me.  I do enjoy a good hike, but I think I enjoy exploring <br/>
a new place even more--whether hiking or not.  One of my favorite <br/>
things is finding a well-carved stamp.  I happen to work obsessively <br/>
enough though that it is difficult to get out on long hikes, so I am <br/>
so thankful for the easier finds.  I love the thought of the effort <br/>
and creativity going into the stamps.  I keep an F count, but it is <br/>
in reflection of the fun adventures that every one of those finds was <br/>
for me.  The numbers represent all of the good times I have had.  I <br/>
felt the same way about them when I was PFX3 as I am now nearing <br/>
PFX200. <br/>
<br/>
The area I live in only had two boxes when I began.  I planted easy <br/>
boxes to give people something to find since I only had letterboxers <br/>
that were passing briefly through on their way to and from <br/>
Yellowstone.  Now that it is finally growing and there are other <br/>
boxes, I find myself feeling more drawn to make some plants that <br/>
challenge people to think.  I realize that it will likely be years <br/>
before many find these boxes since there aren't really others out <br/>
there, but that is okay.  I know that it will be valued by those who <br/>
make the effort.  I love the response I have still had from some <br/>
easier finds.  For instance, one of the earliest series I planted was <br/>
right by the river in a central park in my town.  They are pretty <br/>
easy finds, but I have had so many emails commenting on how much they <br/>
enjoyed finding them because they hadn't realized what pretty spots <br/>
can be found in this area.  My first plant ever is by a waterfall <br/>
that is off of the main highway on a dirt road.  It is less than five <br/>
feet from the dirt road and certainly a drive-by, but nobody passing <br/>
the area would know that there is a beautiful waterfall so close to <br/>
where they were if they didn't go looking for the drive-by box.<br/>
<br/>
We all value different things.  And I, for one, deeply admire and <br/>
enjoy learning from those who have these amazing PFX counts--even <br/>
though I could never dream of mine being anywhere near what theirs <br/>
are unless I move.  I love the history that is entailed in those <br/>
numbers, and I love hearing the stories and memories that are <br/>
associated with the history of long-time and avid letterboxers.<br/>
