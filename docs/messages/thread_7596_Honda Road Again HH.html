Crazy is a good thing!  Karin (psychomommy) just emailed me and said that you are going to teach her how to make your way cool log books at the meet and greet - can I join that class too???<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting you!<br/>

Can't wait til the summer season is over so we can invade Sarah's off <br/>
season beach type place and find your boxes!  <br/>
<br/>
We are so amazingly jealous of you!  Two hitchers for one person.  No <br/>
fair.  Well, we are not even halfway to 60 boxes yet so if that's <br/>
what it will take, we will just have to keep boxing.  (oh the <br/>
humanity)<br/>
<br/>
Check the previous posting for info on the book making class.  Ooh, <br/>
that makes it sound like we're taking bets.  Rest assured, we are <br/>
not, except you can bet that we will get a hitchhiker and soon!<br/>

P.S.  We nabbed Squirrels mystery "School Box" today.  We were the <br/>
first ones in, and we are beaming with pride.<br/>
