                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, everybody,<br/>
<br/>
Der Mad Stamper here... <br/>
Let me just go on record as saying that Daniel's Kids Corner idea is<br/>
fantastic.  Getting kids iterested in letterboxing is the key to turning this<br/>
hobby into a long-term success.<br/>
<br/>
I am very keen on seeing the L-USA Kids Corner come to life.  In order to<br/>
realize this goal, I have been brainstorming about possible directions this<br/>
project could go.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to take a leap into the darkness here, and present some of my ideas<br/>
to the group.  Many of you work and live with kids on a daily basis, so please<br/>
help me and Daniel by interjecting your comments and suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I love the Pooh picture that Dan put on the intro page to Kids Corner!  It is<br/>
the perfect beginning for a grand letterboxing adventure.  I would like to see<br/>
a bit of creative narration describing how Pooh and friends are about to go<br/>
looking for a letterbox (perhaps hidden by Tigger and/or Eeyore), and inviting<br/>
the readers to help find it.  Clicking on the map could launch the reader on a<br/>
make-believe adventure, while clicking on other parts of the picture could<br/>
lead to various letterboxing activities.<br/>
<br/>
The make-believe adventure I envision is centered around the 100 Aker Woods<br/>
map.  As an exercise in map reading, the web page could offer a description of<br/>
the path that Pooh &amp; Co. will follow to find their letterbox.  Kids will have<br/>
to follow the map and click on several destination points to work their way<br/>
through a maze of clues.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the online adventure, once the virtual letterbox has been found,<br/>
the narrative could describe the acts of "stamping in" to the guestbook, and<br/>
collecting the letterbox stamp in a personal book.  I envision this taking<br/>
place within the continuing story of Pooh &amp; friends very conversational, in a<br/>
learn-by-example sort of way... rather than a dry, emotionless description of<br/>
the process.  The graphic here might be a simple drawing of the actual<br/>
letterbox with its contents, and of the personal book of the seeker.  Clicking<br/>
on the letterbox could take you to a section on how to make your own<br/>
letterbox.  Clicking on the book would take you to the section on how to go<br/>
out and hunt for letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
The section on hunting for letterboxes could begin with a checklist of the<br/>
things you need to take with you when you go hunting for letterboxes. (book,<br/>
stamp, ink pad, etc.)  It could then have a link to the list of kid-friendly<br/>
letterbox clues, and possibly a link to a page of notes regarding the use of<br/>
maps, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The other section would include step-by-step instructions for placing your own<br/>
letterbox.  I envision at least 4 parts to this section:<br/>
<br/>
1.)  Making a Stamp.  Im already working on this part.  To view what I've<br/>
created so far, go to the <a href="http://www.pclink.com/elf/kidscorn.htm"><br/>
Kids Corner</a> page and click on Winnie the Pooh.  This takes you to a page<br/>
I'm working on about how kids can carve their own stamps.  Clicking on the bat<br/>
at the bottom of the page takes you to some graphics I've been collecting for<br/>
this project.<br/>
<br/>
On this graphics page, click on the right arrow at the bottom of the page to<br/>
view another idea I have for helping kids to make their own stamps.<br/>
<br/>
2.) Assembly.  This part would list exactly what to include in the letterbox,<br/>
and where to get it.  In other words, what to use as a guestbook, what to use<br/>
as a container, etc.<br/>
<br/>
3.) Hiding.  This part would give tips on what sort of location to look for<br/>
when choosing a hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
4.) Clues.  This part would give tips on how to compose a good clue, how to<br/>
make a map, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's my vision, so far.  I hope it gives us a place to start and helps<br/>
to get the suggestions flowing on the Kids Corner. Please take my ideas into<br/>
consideration and give us some feedback regarding what we can do to make this<br/>
area of the L-USA site a big success.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch Klink<br/>

<br/>
This is an absolutely great idea!! (IMHO) A beautiful intro for kids. <br/>
As I recall, both Mitch and I weighed in _against_ cyberboxing when <br/>
the idea was first broached - a real Pandora's Box, so to speak, we <br/>
thought. But this is not the same thing at all. Or if it is, it just <br/>
shows me how easily I jump to wrong conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of kids in my school who are getting turned on to <br/>
letterboxing, and who have been going out with their parents on <br/>
week-ends to hunt for Erik's, Susan's, and my boxes. They are old and <br/>
skilled enough (11, 12ish) not to need the Pooh intro. But I bet <br/>
they'd have a lot of fun with it anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Go with it, Mitch.<br/>

to their intellectual property being portrayed thusly.  If this is not an<br/>
issue, I apologize in advance, and it seems like a worthwile project <br/>
otherwise :-) (According to what I have in my library, all of that Pooh<br/>
stuff had its copyright renewed by A. A. Milne in 1956; I'm not sure if these<br/>
things expire or not, and is now in the public domain).<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I should (hopefully) have the letterboxing.org domain up by the end of <br/>
the month.<br/>

That could be an issue.  With all the Pooh stuff that continues to<br/>
surface, some copyright must be owned somewhere by someone.  Even though<br/>
this is a not-for-profit venture, the artist, or whomever owns the<br/>
rights still has recourse.  The educational slant doesn't work either as<br/>
that only allows for one copy to be made.  With all the talent that<br/>

&gt; through a maze of clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the end of the online adventure, once the virtual letterbox has been found,<br/>
&gt; the narrative could describe the acts of "stamping in" to the guestbook, and<br/>
&gt; collecting the letterbox stamp in a personal book.  I envision this taking<br/>
&gt; place within the continuing story of Pooh &amp; friends very conversational, in a<br/>
&gt; learn-by-example sort of way... rather than a dry, emotionless description of<br/>
&gt; the process.  The graphic here might be a simple drawing of the actual<br/>
&gt; letterbox with its contents, and of the personal book of the seeker.  Clicking<br/>
&gt; on the letterbox could take you to a section on how to make your own<br/>
&gt; letterbox.  Clicking on the book would take you to the section on how to go<br/>
&gt; out and hunt for letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The section on hunting for letterboxes could begin with a checklist of the<br/>
&gt; things you need to take with you when you go hunting for letterboxes. (book,<br/>
&gt; stamp, ink pad, etc.)  It could then have a link to the list of kid-friendly<br/>
&gt; letterbox clues, and possibly a link to a page of notes regarding the use of<br/>
&gt; maps, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The other section would include step-by-step instructions for placing your own<br/>
&gt; letterbox.  I envision at least 4 parts to this section:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1.)  Making a Stamp.  Im already working on this part.  To view what I've<br/>
&gt; created so far, go to the <a href="http://www.pclink.com/elf/kidscorn.htm"><br/>
&gt; Kids Corner</a> page and click on Winnie the Pooh.  This takes you to a page<br/>
&gt; I'm working on about how kids can carve their own stamps.  Clicking on the bat<br/>
&gt; at the bottom of the page takes you to some graphics I've been collecting for<br/>
&gt; this project.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On this graphics page, click on the right arrow at the bottom of the page to<br/>
&gt; view another idea I have for helping kids to make their own stamps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2.) Assembly.  This part would list exactly what to include in the letterbox,<br/>
&gt; and where to get it.  In other words, what to use as a guestbook, what to use<br/>
&gt; as a container, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3.) Hiding.  This part would give tips on what sort of location to look for<br/>
&gt; when choosing a hiding place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4.) Clues.  This part would give tips on how to compose a good clue, how to<br/>
&gt; make a map, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, that's my vision, so far.  I hope it gives us a place to start and helps<br/>
&gt; to get the suggestions flowing on the Kids Corner. Please take my ideas into<br/>
&gt; consideration and give us some feedback regarding what we can do to make this<br/>
&gt; area of the L-USA site a big success.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; Mitch Klink<br/>

<br/>
Randy makes a very valid point.  I was under the mistaken impression that the<br/>
"classic" Pooh images (as opposed to the Disney versions) were now in public<br/>
domain.  This apparently is not the case.<br/>
(see <a href="http://builder.cnet.com/Business/Law/ss06a.html"><br/>
http://builder.cnet.com/Business/Law/ss06a.html</a> )<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps Dan is right, however, in suggesting that before we give up entirely<br/>
on the idea, we might try asking for permission.  The above link provides some<br/>
leads on who to contact regarding this.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, we should probably follow Thom's advice and begin thinking about<br/>
creating our own art.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought I read recently that the copyright to Pooh would be expiring<br/>
soon .... this is what my limited understanding can contribute. maybe.<br/>
In the books I own, it says that E.P. Dutton copyrighted Winnie the<br/>
Pooh in 1926, and House at Pooh Corner in 1928. A.A. Milne <br/>
renewed these copyrights in 1954 and 1956 respectively. If what <br/>
I understand about the change in copyright law that took place in<br/>
1978 is correct: works that were originally published/copyrighted<br/>
before Jan. 1, 1978 have a copyright of 28 years which can be <br/>
renewed in the 28th year for an additional 47 years to end up with a <br/>
total copyright protection term of  75 years before that work would pass<br/>
into the public domain. If some international law does not affect Milne's<br/>
work, I think these two works would pass into the public domain in<br/>
2001 for Winnie the Pooh, and 2003 for The House at Pooh Corner. <br/>
This may explain the plethora of licensing that is happening now....<br/>
Pooh is everywhere! ~ and I think that Disney must have a bigtime<br/>
licensing agreement with "The Trustees of the Pooh Properties"<br/>
(there really is such a thing according to the copyright notice in<br/>
one of my books!) ~ probably they get to hold onto the copyrights/<br/>
trademarks of the Disney Pooh, but I'll bet not "classic" Pooh.<br/>
Sorry so long ~ but maybe the wet blanket is really only damp?<br/>
