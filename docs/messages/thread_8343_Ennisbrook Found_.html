Are you trying to tell us something. Speak up? Have you ever noticed <br/>
that you do this often; you post another person's message again. I <br/>
don't get it. What are you trying to say. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This question comes from Bookworm.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just back from Ennisbrook to investigate the missing Whoo situation.  <br/>
The good news is, Whoo is indeed there.  Bad news is, HE'S FALLEN &amp; <br/>
HE CAN'T GET UP.  We spotted the box way down inside the hollow tree <br/>
trunk.  Some critter must have nudged it all the way up the hollow <br/>
branch to where it could drop into the main trunk.  <br/>
It was way out of arm's reach, so we went into McGuyver mode &amp; began <br/>
rigging up various contraptions to try to fish the box out.  Branches <br/>
fashioned into giant chopsticks, miniature string lasso, various duck <br/>
tape configurations, etc. - no luck.<br/>
Unfortunately, a little girl &amp; her mom showed up and greeted us <br/>
with "whacha doin'?".  When they came back later &amp; made the same <br/>
inquiry, we decided to abort our rescue mission, feelig like dorks.<br/>
So, whoever is going to rescue this box will need to bring <br/>
appropriate gear.  Perhaps a walking stick with a nail on the end to <br/>
skewer the thing (in which case you'll want to bring a replacement <br/>
box, too).  Otherwise, I have one of those mechanical arm things that <br/>
looks like something out of a Warner Bros. cartoon, which should do <br/>
the trick.<br/>
But I don't know when I'll be back up there, so Don, <br/>
Amy...whoever...feel free!<br/>
In other Ennisbrook news, we also planted Andrew - the cat who tried <br/>
to eat Flutterby.  Clues to follow shortly.<br/>
