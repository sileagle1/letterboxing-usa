<br/>
Congrats!  I still haven't found one yet.... *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The person who planted it wants me to email him as to it's new<br/>
&gt; location. Do I tell them where I am going to plant it or where I <br/>
&gt; found it and keep the new location secret? <br/>
<br/>
It doesn't *really* matter.  At the very least, you should let him <br/>
know where you found it.  It's nice to tell where you hide it too, <br/>
though, just so the person who started it can keep track of where it <br/>
is and if it went missing or not.  I like to know where my <br/>
hitchhikers are, but I never tell anyone where the person hid them <br/>
until after I know it's already been picked up again.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I also would like to know if I can place it with a box I already<br/>
&gt; found or with one of the ones I planted already?<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely.  No letterbox is safe from a hitchhiker!  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; When I put it with another box does it count as a plant for me?<br/>
<br/>
Nope.  You can count it as a plant if you started the box.  Carved <br/>
the stamp, created a logbook for it, and that sort of thing.  But <br/>
to 'place' a hitchhiker that someone else made shouldn't count!  <br/>
(Sometimes, I think the term should be 'created', not 'placed'.)<br/>

<div>I've told them where it's been, but not where it's 
going.  That way it stays as a surpise for whoever gets it next. It 
only counts as a P if you created the hitchhiker.  You can hide it 
absolutely anywhere, too.  </div>
