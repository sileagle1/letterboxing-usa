I am thrilled when people take the time to send me a quick Email after finding one of my boxes.  Whether it be an update on the condition of the box, or comments (good or bad)... I love to hear back from people.  I always try to contact the placer myself, after finding their box.  Just makes sense.  So, in my opinion, yes it matters! <br/>

I don't think that it's a practice that's carved in stone. but I get <br/>
the impression that people like to do it anyway.  Especially, if it <br/>
was a challenging box to find.  You would definately want to make <br/>
contact if the box is missing or damaged.  Also, you might want to <br/>
critique the clues and give the placer some suggestions to better <br/>
describe landmarks.  <br/>
<br/>
As a surveyor and former forester who has spent much of my <br/>
professional life searching for things in the woods, I quickly became <br/>
aware that many of the placers don't know how to properly describe <br/>
things.  Another thing that people aren't aware of is how fast things <br/>
change in a natural environment.  You'd be surprised how fast a <br/>
fallen log or a stump becomes a pile of duff.  <br/>

I love hearing from people who have found mine, and<br/>

Of course, if you find a box that needs attention, you<br/>
should definately contact the owner to let them know<br/>
ASAP<br/>
