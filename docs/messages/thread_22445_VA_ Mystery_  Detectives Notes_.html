I went down to the Grande Hotel to meet up with Bubbles Yablonsky to discuss the case.  <br/>
-----<br/>
Bubbles gazed around the hotel wondering what shed gotten herself into.  What mystery<br/>
could possible take so many detectives and inspectors to solve?  Then Nick walked in and sat down next to her.<br/>
------<br/>
"Pssstt, Hello sweetheart.  Been checking out the guests?"  <br/>
<br/>
"Sure Nick.  There are so many detectives in town now.  I watched the Las Vegas CSI crew [by Music Woman] check in this morning.  Nick and Nora Charles [by Top Hat] just walked by, and you saw that Belgian fellow arrive on the Orient Express [by Scarab] this morning.  Next thing you know James Bond [promised soon] will show up!"<br/>
<br/>
"Speak of the devil," said Nick pointing.<br/>
<br/>
Bubbles swung her head around, maybe too excitedly.  "Austin Powers?! [by Poison Ivy] You tricked me!"<br/>
<br/>
"Ow! Hey, that's not necessary," Nick laughed.  <br/>
<br/>
Inspector Nevis walked up and joined the group.  "Did you pick up our new business cards to pass out at the gather?"  <br/>
<br/>
"Sure I did Nevis.  You'd think I was a messenger, not an experienced detective," said Bubbles, making a face.  "Got the special clues printed on the back too.  Got em for all five of us."  <br/>
<br/>
"Maybe six," said Nick.  <br/>
<br/>
"Oh, who's the girlfriend now, Nick," Detective Grogue smirked as he walked up.  <br/>
<br/>
"Hush, or they'll be watching us instead of us them," growled Nick.  <br/>
<br/>
"The Grande Hotel!" said Grogue helping himself to a seat.  "You sit in the lobbly long enough and everyone that's interesting will walk by eventually.  See, those two ladies?  Look harmless?  Remember Arsenic and Old Lace? [Knights of Colombo]  They poisoned lonely gentlemen and buried them in their basement.  I hear there's enough intrigue here for Hitchcock, Edward Gorey, and Edgar Allen Poe [by Gallant Rogue, Dragonfly, and Natty Bumpo].    <br/>
<br/>
"There's the Dutch Cleanser Girl [Sewsoobizzy], said Bubbles.  "This salesmen convention sure makes things weird around here. Especially with all these product people as suspects. You hear they're now calling the murder of Mr. Boddy 'Death of a Salesman'?  Theyre gonna have a big mystery gather and Clue Exchange Game to sort it all out."<br/>
<br/>
"Help! You must help me! I know you all are detectives, please!"<br/>
<br/>
"Calm down Cracker Jack, [by Scarab]" said Nick.  "What's the big trouble?"<br/>
<br/>
"How do you know who I am!?"<br/>
<br/>
"Sailor suit and caramel cologne?  You're not the Keebler Elf [Knights of Colombo]."<br/>
<br/>
"It's Bic Man [Penguin Patrol].  He's trying to run me over with the Weiner Mobile. [Team Little Dog]"<br/>
<br/>
"Pssstt.  Did I say weird," whispered Grogue.  "Alright Cracker Jack.  I'll take your statement and have someone take you back to the Howard Johnson's. [Sewsoobizzy]"<br/>
<br/>
"Well sweetheart, I've got a bad feeling feeling about all this.  The night's getting darker."<br/>
<br/>
"At least someone's going to get a lot of fine impressions out of this.  There's a lot of talent here."  <br/>
<br/>
"Yeah?  Well I'm carrying a concealed Speedball Lino Cutter [by Penguin Patrol] just in case."<br/>

Think ya got what it takes to solve the case?   Please write me and let me know you want to play in the "Death of a Salesman" Clue Exchange Game.  He'll write back.  Nick's pretty good pounding on that old Royal.   <br/>
<br/>
Detective Grogue would like to know if you plan on attending the pre and post gather events, so he can make plans.  <br/>
<br/>
"Hey Bubbles, where's our mystery cartographer?  How will people know where to go?"  "Nick forgot her detective name.  We'll hear from her soon."<br/>
