Welcome to Warren, Rhode Island, home to Latte Man and me since 1997. <br/>
It is a nice town with coastal views, a walkable downtown historic <br/>
district, antique stores, a good variety of restaurants, and some <br/>
gradual downtown revitalization in progress.<br/>
<br/>
You may wish to precede your letterboxing visit with a Virtual <br/>
Historic Walking Tour at http://www.netsense.net/~richwill/Warren/. <br/>
This website includes a Walking Tour Map if you want to walk it while <br/>
you're in town. There is also a Word Search and Scavenger Hunt on the <br/>
site.<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is hidden in Burr's Hill Park, which appears on some <br/>
maps as Band Shell Park. The park is often busy with people enjoying <br/>
outdoor sports: baseball, basketball, tennis, youth football, <br/>
walking, cycling. The park's main focal point is the band shell.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions are to the parking lot at Burr's Hill Park. <br/>
Parking is free to all from after Labor Day to right before Memorial <br/>
Day. During the summer, resident stickers are required, except during <br/>
free concerts at the band shell, when all are welcome. Check <br/>
newspapers for concert dates and times- a great time to visit. <br/>
Otherwise, there is quite a bit of free parking on the streets of <br/>
downtown (watch for no parking signs in some areas), and you can <br/>
reach the park on foot by Water Street, the bike path, the park-and-<br/>
ride on Franklin Street just east of Main Street, or by going behind <br/>
Super Mart Convenience Store on Main Street. <br/>
