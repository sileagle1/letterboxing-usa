Bridle Trails SP "Wild Ponies"<br/>

Clues: easy to medium.  See notes below.<br/>
Distance and time.  This loop can be walked in 1 to 1  hours.  <br/>
Adding the nature series loop will add 30 to 45 minutes of <br/>
appreciative walking.  Terrain is gentle and mostly level.<br/>
<br/>
Bridle Trails SP Natural Area was originally purchased and <br/>
established as an equestrian park by the farmers of the "east side" <br/>
of Seattle.  They built and maintained the trails and established a <br/>
small show ring facility.  Over the years as the community grew the <br/>
park became a hub of equestrian sport in the Pacific Northwest.  In <br/>
the early 60's the park was deeded over to the state with the <br/>
provision that it remain a facility for equestrian use.<br/>
<br/>
Now we face the closure of this and other parks around the state.  <br/>
The focus of the facility is pleasure riding and small shows are held <br/>
to raise funds, all of which go back to the park.  Many schools hold <br/>
outdoor classrooms here and nature nuts love the bountiful plants <br/>
birds and trees.  <br/>
<br/>
Come enjoy this beautiful example of second growth forest.  If you <br/>
are shy of horses, fear not, the park is so big you are unlikely to <br/>
meet a horse face to face.  If you do stand quietly to the right and <br/>
speak to the rider.  They will likely pass you on the left, just like <br/>
a car.  If you are near a blind corner call "Heads Up" which is a <br/>
fairly universal warning call for horsemen.<br/>
<br/>
Wear waterproof shoes or boots in the season and, yes there will be <br/>
road apples to avoid.   All the usual rules about safety, box hiding <br/>
and environment respect apply here.  Because of the horses, all boxes <br/>
are right on or near the trail, not back in the shrubbery.<br/>
