scrapbooking sites.<br/>
<br/>
This blog:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.scrapbookupdate.com/scrapnancy/2007/02/new_exhibitors_.html<br/>
<br/>
has something of interest:<br/>
<br/>
"wouldn't it be great if you could make your own acrylic stamps out of<br/>
your artwork or a photo? British company Photocentric was exhibiting a<br/>
product in the New Exhibitor area that will let stampers do exactly<br/>
that. The company sells the imagepac stamp maker kit, which allows<br/>
stampers to print an image from their computer and use a gel hardened<br/>
with a 60watt light bulb to turn it into a clear acrylic stamp. This<br/>
amazing-sounding process is already in widespread commercial use in<br/>
the U.K. and sold out on U.K. QVC before it could even be<br/>
demonstrated!<br/>
<br/>
The downside of the process is that there is an initial large<br/>
investment in the kit, which retails for $140, after which the company<br/>
claims that individual stamps cost only 20% of a similar retail<br/>
product to produce."<br/>
<br/>
http://www.photocentric.co.uk/<br/>
<br/>
The blog also has a bit about the new Tim Holtz ink-related releases here:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
And the new double-sided accordion mini album from 7-Gypsies at the<br/>
top...what a great idea for a logbook. I am already thinking how I<br/>
could possibly make one of those out of envelopes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The snip on BoBunny Press is also of interest, if you like making<br/>
logbooks. Though 9 x 9 is big for a logbook...but precut 6 x 6 papers<br/>
would make great logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.scrapbookupdate.com/scrapnancy/2007/02/cha_from_a_to_z_1.html<br/>
<br/>
"As a wider variety of page sizes - especially smaller ones - become<br/>
more common, more companies are taking note and BoBunny is no<br/>
exception. They are adding a 9x9 binder to their existing 6x6 naked<br/>
binder product line, and also coming out with 6x6 pads of pre-designed<br/>
pages."<br/>
<br/>
Normally I don't like BoBunny Press's designs -- for me they are too<br/>
loud and cutesy. But for some boxes they would be an option, if that<br/>
appeals to your own style.<br/>
<br/>
According to this entry:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.scrapbookupdate.com/scrapnancy/2007/02/cha_from_a_to_z_2.html<br/>
<br/>
There is a new book out from C&amp;T on making quilted fabric covers for<br/>
journals and scrapbooks: Fast, Fun &amp; Easy Book Cover Art, which could<br/>
be an interesting idea for one's personal logbook, to protect it but<br/>
also to make it more tactile. They have another book out on fine art<br/>
techniques for paper crafts. Personally I am looking at this new 7 x<br/>
5" blank board book -- just buy and cover with papers and accent sof<br/>
your choice for an interesting and new logbook!<br/>
<br/>
"In addition to their publications, C&amp;T also sells a line of board<br/>
books for papercrafters to use. At CHA Winter they announced two new<br/>
additions to this line: a 7" x 5" tap top book, and a 12" x 12"<br/>
display board book. No doubt they will be popular additions to the<br/>
board book line especially with affordable price tags of $7.95 and<br/>
$9.95 respectively."<br/>
<br/>
I made one of these at a BoBunny Press class with their new product<br/>
lines from last spring. You don't have to buy one of these blank books<br/>
though...you can buy board books at the Dollar Store and cover each<br/>
page and the covers with papers of your choice.<br/>
<br/>
And Doodlebug is getting into the INK market:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.scrapbookupdate.com/scrapnancy/2007/02/cha_from_a_to_z_3.htm<br/>
<br/>
"Along with their stamps, Doodlebug also debuted their own line of<br/>
inks in colors that match their corporate palette. The pigment ink<br/>
pads have an MSRP of $3.49 and the collection includes basic black and<br/>
white, as well as ten other colors."<br/>
<br/>
There's more on inking and bookmaking coming out, as well as on<br/>
stamping, but these are some exciting new products that might be<br/>
useful in letterboxing.<br/>
