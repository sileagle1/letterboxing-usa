                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,  I wanted to make sure I hadn't offended anyone with my earlier <br/>
comment.  I was trying to calm done the fire a little by suggesting that the <br/>
geocache list subscription  could only be confirmed by someone using the <br/>
Letterbox-USA email name.  So we had nothing to worry about. I must have been <br/>
wrong, looks like anyone could confirm.  Sorry.  I was assuming that we <br/>
hadn't been confirmed yet, only spammed.<br/>
  I am guessing that the poor soul who verified might have done so thinking <br/>
it was for himself and not for the whole LbNA talk list and the original <br/>
person requesting the subscription may have made a similar well intentioned <br/>
blunder.  I am sure no one was being intentionally iritating.  :o)  The <br/>
benefit of the doubt never hurts.  I know I have filled in the wrong field by <br/>
mistake on line and forwarded things to the someone unintentionally before.  <br/>
Sometimes I even forward things to myself ... duh.<br/>
  As for the geocaching sport ... my husband loves it. He rented the Blair <br/>
Witch movie last fall and then impressed upon me how that would never happen <br/>
to him if he had a GPS!  <br/>
  My kids and I like the clues and have fun with the stamps  but my kids <br/>
really love the caches (ancient treasures as far as they are concerned).  <br/>
They also enjoy the GPS and trying to follow the ever turning arrow.  So we <br/>
are a mixture.  :o)   To each his own, it gets us all out on the hiking trail <br/>
one way or another.  <br/>
Although I'm no good with the GPS, I got myself, my two kids, my friend and <br/>
her two big boys and one toddler really lost in the woods with it last week.  <br/>
According to my 6 year old , we walked at least 65 miles that day!<br/>
  I've said more than enough.  Amen.<br/>
