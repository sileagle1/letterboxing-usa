website for the states below. Most of them still have more boxes to add, but <br/>
we're pretty sure that what's left over belongs to active 'boxers who will <br/>
personally put them up. Many, many thanks to SpringChick, Psychokiwi, and <br/>
MsAlafair who have been madly tweaking the maps, regions, and counties, as <br/>
well as entering boxes with us, and special kudos to everyone in boxingdom <br/>
who has added their own letterboxes to the new website. Astonished <br/>
incredulity to that Wes guy who hasn't stopped working his baby since it took <br/>
breath last week.<br/>

What I'm pretty sure is complete (I may have missed a couple...):<br/>
