Looks like the Apple Dumpling Gang missed some wild times on Yahoo <br/>
while we were boxing this weekend!  I had to write and tell you how <br/>
much I appreciated your stories and your approach.<br/>

P.S.  The windshield won't get you if you fly a little higher.  (or <br/>
stay off of the road altogether)<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have been under the impression that we should be hiding our <br/>
boxes in a <br/>
&gt; &gt; way that does not require disturbing the area in order to <br/>
retrieve the <br/>
&gt; &gt; box.  (Leave no trace)  In my mind that has meant not placing <br/>
anything <br/>
&gt; &gt; really "off trail". <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We should be.  Most of my boxes (including the one in question, <br/>
most likely),<br/>
&gt; average less than 5 visitors a year (in reality, less than 2, but <br/>
if I make<br/>
&gt; that claim, someone will flame me if they saw 3 stamps in one of <br/>
the ones in <br/>
&gt; question because they missed the words "most" and "average", <br/>
sigh ...).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That is far less than other off-trail activity in the areas, from <br/>
sports such <br/>
&gt; as hunting, fishing, geocaching, adventure racing, and <br/>
orienteering, all of <br/>
&gt; which are at higher volumes, some of which also leave no trace at <br/>
these higher <br/>
&gt; volumes, and all of which are socially accepted in the areas in <br/>
question.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm confident that I'm a very ethical placer and respect the <br/>
woods.  Anyone is<br/>
&gt; free to remove any of my boxes that they feel violate these ethics.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers<br/>

&gt; who gets flamed when simply trying to prevent a flame war, oh well, <br/>
some days<br/>
&gt; you're the windshield, somedays the bug ;-)<br/>
