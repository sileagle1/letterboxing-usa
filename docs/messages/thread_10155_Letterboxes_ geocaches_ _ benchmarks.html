                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am primarily a geocacher because there are few letterboxes in close <br/>
proximity to me.  I've not found a hybrid cache/box yet but look <br/>
forward to doing so in the future.  I also have plans to make one <br/>
myself.  As some have mentioned in the caching forums, those who <br/>
choose to do a hybrid may consider gluing the stamp to the lid of the <br/>
container.  Apparently some have had success with this and it does <br/>
sound feasible if you do it right.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding caches vs. letterboxes, I defy any boxer to say that he/she <br/>
hasn't once, not one time, been disappointed by a letterbox, its <br/>
stamp, or the route to get to it.  Both hobbies have their <br/>
shortcomings and their share of sucky boxes but that doesn't negate <br/>
the overall "good time fun" of both sports.  Both also have awesome <br/>
challenging searches with payoff of real "treasures" at the end of <br/>
the hunt.  And most geocachers seem to consider the hunt the most <br/>
important part, not the box-o-crud at the end of the rainbow.  Many <br/>
don't trade, just sign the log.<br/>
<br/>
I stamp my letterboxing stamp into geocache logs.  Some cachers may <br/>
understand what it is, some may not.  Some cachers use crafting paper <br/>
punches to notch designs in the logpage they sign.  Others print out <br/>
sticker labels on their computers with their team logo and stick <br/>
these into the logs.  One team in our area is the Penguins, and each <br/>
cache container they've visited has many little penguin stickers <br/>
adorning it and the logbook.  These containers have just as much <br/>
personality and interest as some letterboxes (if not more) in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the hunt itself, I think most cachers don't bushwhack any <br/>
more than necessary.  I certainly don't go off a trail unless I think <br/>
I need to - I don't need excess ticks, beggar's lice, or brambles.  <br/>
And I have nothing but respect and love for the environment - that's <br/>
why I'm out there in the first place!!<br/>
<br/>
For those who still pooh-pooh geocaching, I offer up the challenge of <br/>
benchmark hunting:<br/>

<br/>
This can be done without a GPS (and most people find they do better <br/>
turning off the GPS for these anyway).  Surveyors disks are placed <br/>
all over, you probably have a bunch in your area and drive past some <br/>
everyday.  Go find some, take photos, make a charcoal rubbing of the <br/>
disk as a memento - its like a stamp, does that help?<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, have fun and be open-minded.  In all honesty I've <br/>
been more irritated reading this forum, but I enjoy boxing so I keep <br/>
it on Ignore most of the time.<br/>
