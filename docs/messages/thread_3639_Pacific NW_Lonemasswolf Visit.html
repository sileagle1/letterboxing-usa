<br/>
Our visit with Lonemasswolf in the Portland area was terrific.  The man<br/>
has quite an array of stamps in his collection and, as a seasoned pro,<br/>
he gave us tips on some letterboxing etiquette (like can I stamp a<br/>
hitchhiker in my logbook that my boyfriend found?  The answer is "no" by<br/>
the way.  I'll have to go out and get my own hitchhiker!)  It was a<br/>
wonderful get together.  Thanks to those who showed up so we could all<br/>
meet each other!  <br/>
<br/>
The line up of Pacific NW All-Stars who came out to give Fred a warm<br/>
welcome are:  Der Mad Stamper -- one of the founding fathers of this<br/>
hobby, Amanda in Seattle, Ryan Carpenter, Beth &amp; Mark, Funhog, Maronie,<br/>
and myself.  It was a great evening and we closed the pizza place down!<br/>
It was really fun getting together and discussing letterboxing and going<br/>
over each other's logbooks.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, Amanda in Seattle WOULD NOT show the stamp for the Spirit<br/>
of Dartmoor since it reveals where the stamp is placed so no easy gimme<br/>
on that for me!!!<br/>
<br/>
Everyone was all abuzz about Murder in Gabriel Park!, which Ryan placed<br/>
in Portland last week.  Amanda Arkebauer is a star. She  had solved the<br/>
mystery and achieved all 6 boxes before showing up for the event.  Great<br/>
job, Amanda!  By the way, she is very beautiful and glamourous (unlike<br/>
another Amanda <br/>
we've heard about -HA! HA!)  It was a really great time at Izzy's last<br/>
night and I hope we can do it again in the spring.  <br/>
<br/>
Once we use up all the film we'll get it developed and forward the<br/>
photos to Der Mad Stamper to post on the website.  Hopefully, they<br/>
turned out O.K.  I'm not quite sure about my photography skills, but<br/>
they're probably marginally better than a sharp stick in the eye.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Lonemasswolf for gracing us with his presence and everyone who<br/>
made the effort to come out for this event so we could finally meet and<br/>
talk.  What a great time it was!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
