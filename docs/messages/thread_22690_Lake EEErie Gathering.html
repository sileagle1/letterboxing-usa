                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from my first event, held at Bay Village, just west of <br/>
Cleveland Ohio.   All I have to say is "IT WAS A BLAST".    The creators<br/>
of this event, Polly and Fran,  did a wonderful job of organizing,<br/>
decorating  and then keeping it going during intermittent  driving<br/>
rainstorms in 50 degree weather.  In spite of the rain and cool weather<br/>
the group took off in smaller groups and scoured the park for the 12<br/>
boxes placed in the woods and on the beach of Lake Erie.   The hunt was<br/>
taken after the Event Stamp stamping from events all over the U.S., an<br/>
exchange of stamps from within the group, a delightful speaker with<br/>
exceptional knowledge of the 'HAUNTED"......and of course an excellent <br/>
potluck meal including hot cider (super duper).<br/>
I just wanted to publicly thank Polly and Fran and the other attendees<br/>
for providing me with cherished memories that will last a lifetime.<br/>
