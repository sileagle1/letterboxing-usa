Is there anything new in this box that I don't know or can't find on some of the web sites?<br/>
<br/>
The reviews I read were pretty much by people just discovering the sport.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.<br/>

Are you sure you are looking for a box?  I hadn't heard of a box by <br/>
that title, but Randy's book is under that title.  (The book is <br/>
great, by the way).<br/>

Personally, I knew a lot of it, but I still treasured the book. It <br/>
was fun to see a few of the stamps from around the country.  I did <br/>
learn a few things that I didn't know about some more unusual clues, <br/>
and it was nice to see a more complete history of letterboxing <br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
It is worth buying, but you can usually find it for less online.<br/>
