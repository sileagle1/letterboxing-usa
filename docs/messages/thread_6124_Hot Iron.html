&gt; Hello Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; April of Stampeaz here in CT, a stamp carver extraordinaire, was <br/>
kind enough to share her method of transfering images to stamp <br/>
medium. I have her permission to quote and she asked that I <br/>
recognize her company (http://www.investorsnet.com/stampeaz/) and <br/>
great service in return. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This method seems to solve the problems of smudging and using <br/>
solvents.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "What I think is the absolute BEST way to transfer <br/>
&gt; xerox/carbon/laser  designs onto rubber or my PZKut<br/>
&gt; is by using a med/hot iron!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Put the design, with a good amount of paper border around it to <br/>
&gt; protect the rubber from direct heat, face down on the PZKut.<br/>
&gt; Press the hot iron onto the design and move the iron around so it <br/>
&gt; gets all of the design.  Do not keep in one place.<br/>
&gt; The heat will also `tac' the paper in place so you don't have to <br/>
tape <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; or worry about it moving and smudging.<br/>
&gt; As it starts to transfer you can lift up a corner here and there <br/>
to see <br/>
&gt; how it is doing. Some places may need more pressure and heat.<br/>
&gt; The paper won't move unless you lift the whole piece up.<br/>
&gt; The transfer should be a dark black.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes you may get 90% black and a spot will be gray, go back <br/>
&gt; to that area with more heat and also pressure.<br/>
&gt; The ironing board should be flat. If it is not flat put cardboard, <br/>
&gt; phone <br/>
&gt; book or something to get it flat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Try it and let me know how it works out. It is absolutely <br/>
incredible <br/>
&gt; how crisp the transfer is. : ) "<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
