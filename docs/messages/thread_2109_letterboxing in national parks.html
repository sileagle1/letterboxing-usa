                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm a former seasonal employee with the USDA Forest Service and would like<br/>
to make some points and suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
1) The first thing to kept in mind is that the Forest Service and the Park<br/>
Service are two entirely different entities that reside in different<br/>
departments of the federal government; Agriculture and Interior,<br/>
respectively.<br/>
<br/>
2) They have two widely differing management philosophies.  There are times<br/>
when they're very much at odds with each other.  The USDA Forest Service<br/>
believes in multiple use.  The Park Service tends more towards preservation<br/>
and recreation.  Someone made a comment about allowing logging.  This only<br/>
happens on forest service land and only in designated areas.<br/>
<br/>
3) I would suggest that the best way of approaching it is to bring the local<br/>
official in on it and to allow him/her to be in on the maintenance of the<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
4) A good way of presenting it to them might be to explain it as a kind of<br/>
glorified trail register.  These are very common along trails in national<br/>
parks and forests.  People who pass sign in with their name, date, start and<br/>
destination.  This helps the managers keep track of usage.<br/>
<br/>
5) Get in contact with a hiking club that operates in that forest/park.  The<br/>
Appalachian Mountain Club (AMC) does trail upkeep and maintains many<br/>
permanent shelters and base lodges.<br/>
<br/>
6) Instead of sticking a Tupperware box in a crevice that might end up as<br/>
litter on the side of the trail, consider offering to construct something<br/>
more substantial like a mortared rock cairn.<br/>
<br/>
7) Assure the officials that the clues will include instructions to check<br/>
into the park office to report the hike.<br/>
<br/>
8) Offer to place interpretive information in boxes near scenic and historic<br/>
areas.<br/>
<br/>
9) Remember, there's lot of bureaucrats in them darn woods!  If their first<br/>
introduction to letterboxing is negative, the memos will fly and it could<br/>
conceivably touch off a letterbox holocaust on all federal land that might<br/>
even spill over into state lands.<br/>
<br/>
10) In conclusion, the best bet is accountability.  The aforementioned<br/>
hiking clubs are organized and incorporated entities with official contact<br/>
people.    They take long-term responsibility for their projects.   If any<br/>
old "Joe Blow" showed up at a park office and said he wanted to build a<br/>
trail shelter, chances are he'd be sent packing post haste.  So here's the<br/>
final challenge: Is this just a casual thing that you do when it's<br/>
convenient for you or are you ready to put your "John Hancock" where it<br/>
counts?  You'd have a better chance of getting onto federal lands if there<br/>
were an organization that took responsibility for letterbox Maintenance and<br/>
Census as well as for setting standards for placing letterboxes on those<br/>
lands.  Anyone who wanted to place a box on such lands would have to check<br/>
in with them.<br/>

Good Luck<br/>

I agree with what you wright. In all my conflict resolution classes I<br/>
learned to talk it out. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, but some<br/>
people will take it personally. Talking to our respective local<br/>
officials is a wonderful idea, and will probably let people know how we<br/>
feel. I suggest also talking to local senators and representatives as<br/>
well as officials of each individual park. <br/>

Mr. Rovetto definitely shared words of wisdom. "Boxers" are by the nature of<br/>
their hobby interested in protecting the National Parks, State parks and all<br/>
open space.  We appreciate how special it is, that's why we are out there.<br/>
Direct communication with these officials would help to foster a<br/>
relationship built on respect. These  Federal employees have to deal with<br/>
masses of people, numerous problems, and do so with a very small budget.  We<br/>
need to ask for their input on how to make this a win/win situation.<br/>
