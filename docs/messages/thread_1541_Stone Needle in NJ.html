                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's my first letterbox clues.  I did it as a rhyme.  <br/>
<br/>
The azimuths are true north and the paces are 2 steps.  The magnetic <br/>
declination here is 11-1/2 degrees west.  So add 11.5 to all of my <br/>
azimuths.  <br/>
<br/>
The starting point should be easy to find with some short historical <br/>
research.  Most people in my section of the state would know as soon <br/>
as they read this.  We're expecting rain tonight and I'm going to go <br/>
back next week to see how it weathered.  As an added incentive to get <br/>
this thing rolling, I'm thinking about placing a gift certificate for <br/>
a free meal at a local restaurant in the box when I go to check it.  <br/>
The first person to find it gets the meal.<br/>
<br/>
So here's the clues:<br/>
<br/>
Stone Needle in New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
In the state I am in, how high can you go?<br/>
The answer to that question Mr. Kuser did know.<br/>
<br/>
He knew it quite well, but now he is gone.<br/>
And in the stone needle the answer lives on.<br/>
<br/>
For the ultimate sacrifice it points to the sky.<br/>
So show some reverence as you draw nigh.<br/>
<br/>
So find the stone needle and stand way below.<br/>
Where you pay to see far is the first place you should go.<br/>
<br/>
Stand between those devices and admire the view.<br/>
You'll know you're all right if the stone needle is 219 true.<br/>
<br/>
Now to the Needle take those devices and point them.<br/>
Add the numbers on their dials to 267 to go then.<br/>
<br/>
Walk thirty-eight paces crossing drive and guide rail.<br/>
To a tree white as snow on the course of a trail.<br/>
<br/>
Now thirty-seven is the way you should face.<br/>
And 109 double steps is the length you should pace.<br/>
<br/>
You'll come to a place where you can't travel by wheel.<br/>
And look for the entry of the very same trail.<br/>
<br/>
There standing before you is a pipe colored white.<br/>

Good goin' John!
<br/>We need more boxes in that part of the country. I look forward to the
hunt.

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There standing before you is a pipe colored white.<br/>
&gt; From beside it you'll start if you want the next course to be right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now along this trail 60 paces you'll head.<br/>
&gt; To a small tree on the right that's marked green and red.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the trail by that tree turn 273.<br/>
&gt; And 18 paces is where it will be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There's a 16 inch oak with a flat rock beside it.<br/>
&gt; Underneath that flat rock is where I did hide it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; ---Let me know how you did and if the clues made sense---<br/>

&gt; Happy Hunting<br/>
