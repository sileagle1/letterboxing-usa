three letterboxes there. It's wonderful to see a "citizen's alliance" <br/>
preserving land in that terrific town...too bad our rich native <br/>
neighbors are more interested in turning Lake of Isles into a 36 hole <br/>
golf course than saving that old campground themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The Grindstone erratic was fabulous. It's not a huge boulder per se, <br/>
maybe 1000 tons, but it is cube shaped and balanced on edge, rather <br/>
than slapped down flat. Amazing! Wish we had brought a camera.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for a lovely day in the woods!<br/>

Jay and kids, many of whom managed to keep dry feet on the stream <br/>
crossing in CT<br/>

So glad your clan managed to keep dry trekking across the stream!  I think <br/>
that our boxes may spur efforts to better establish those trails.  <br/>
