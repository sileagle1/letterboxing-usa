<br/>
Over the past week, we have found 29 letterboxes and 80% of them have <br/>
either been poorly hidden or left out there in the open. This is <br/>
truly a frightening statistic. With the publication of the Time <br/>
magazine article and the new letterboxers coming into the fold, we <br/>
must all be aware of how important it is to carefully rehide <br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
It's up to ALL of us, veterans and new boxers alike, to be sure that <br/>
we leave a letterbox hidden BETTER than we found it as our way of <br/>
preserving these boxes for the future. Please tell all you know how <br/>
important this is and it's impact if we do not take as much time to <br/>
REHIDE the box as to FIND the box!<br/>
<br/>
Don't mean to preach but feel this is an important part of this game!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [And carefully rehide those <br/>
treasures!]<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It seems that recently I have come across more of the same disregard for proper replacement of boxes.  Maybe it's hot and buggy, maybe you're tired and thirsty, maybe you're in a rush to get one more box while there's still some sunlight.... whatever the reason, it's NO reason to leave a box out in the open or improperly hidden.  I think we should ALL treat boxes as if they were our own.  Yep, that includes drying out that damp box, maybe replacing a ripped baggie, wrapping that stamp up in the paper towel, sealing all baggies, making sure the lid is on tight and last but not least, rehiding it just a little better than you found it.  It takes what, an extra minute or two of our time?  Not alot to ask given the time put into these boxes.  On a lighter note... if we ALL treat each others boxes as if they were our own, does that increase our P # ?  lol  Peace, Love and all that jazz, MayEve<br/>
