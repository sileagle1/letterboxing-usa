our quest for Crow Hill LB. We explored trails we had never been on <br/>
before even though we live only a few miles away. It was a perfect <br/>
day for ice sports, many people were out enjoying fishing, skating, <br/>
hockey - and I wish I had brought my skates along when we arrived at <br/>
Rocky Pond. Crow Hill LB was in great shape though a bit lonely with <br/>
only 9 stamped in. Thanks for journey.<br/>
<br/>
khatru has been as busy as Dave and Dee planting boxes.  Last night I <br/>
carved my first stamp for planting but I see I have a lot of catching <br/>
up to do.<br/>
