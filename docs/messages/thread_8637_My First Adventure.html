                    <div class="plaintext-content">First off, many thanks to Der Mad Stamper for that great hike. I <br/>
just completed Act's I and II of the Tryon Creek Quatrain. These are <br/>
the first two stamps in my book, and I hope to have Act's III and IV <br/>
completed next week.  <br/>
<br/>
I implore any Oregon Letterboxers to make their way to Tryon Creek <br/>
Park as soon as they can. The park is just plain breathless (and I <br/>
don't mean the hike...) The outer trails are blanketed with bronze <br/>
and amber leaves and then you turn the corner and the leaves are <br/>
green and gold. Astonishing!<br/>
<br/>
Decoding the clues last night built up great anticipation for todays <br/>
adventure. Thanks for all the fun,<br/>
<br/>
