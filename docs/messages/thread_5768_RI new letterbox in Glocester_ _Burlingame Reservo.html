Burlingame Reservoir Letterbox<br/>
Glocester, RI<br/>
Planted by: Latte Man 6/15/02<br/>
<br/>
Nelson Plant sold his farm with a grist mill site to the state in the <br/>
early 1970's.  It is part of the Durfee Hill Management Area.  One <br/>
can still see evidence of farming as fields where corn used to be <br/>
grown are to be seen.  There is a waterfall where the grist mill used <br/>
to be.  The road that leads to the reservoir is bordered on either <br/>
side by a hemlock grove, rhododendrons, and oaks.  A stream meanders <br/>
throughout and there is a pond that is home to turtles, wood ducks <br/>
and an occasional heron.  CAUTION:  Hunting season is from the second <br/>
Saturday in October to the last day in February.  The trip is easy- <br/>
no more than 1 miles of hiking but the park is large enough to <br/>
invite exploration.<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions: From Chepachet, RI heading west the entrance to <br/>
the park is 3.7 miles from the junction of Routes #100, 102 and 44 at <br/>
the last red light on Chepachet.  Take a left into an unmarked gravel <br/>
driveway across from Howie's Sales and Service a small used car <br/>
dealer. Park in the lot to the right.<br/>
