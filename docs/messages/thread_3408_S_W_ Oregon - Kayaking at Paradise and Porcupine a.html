There are several potential starting points and methods to reach these letterboxes.  From Gold Beach, Oregon, ride a jet boat up to Paradise Lodge. Or, hike up from Foster Bar (Agnes) 12-15 miles. Or, from Grants Pass drive past Galice, park at Grave Creek and start your 5 day hike down the Rogue River Trail.  Or,  fly your small private plane to the grass landing strip behind Paradise Lodge.  The method our family uses is to obtain a Rogue River permit and raft the Wild and Scenic section of the Rogue on a 4-5 day trip.  The trip can also be booked commercially with various river outfitters and most everyone enjoys the stop at <br/>
Paradise Lodge.  <br/>

Once at the lodge, walk toward the west end of the grassy air strip.  At the end of the field, look for the "Trail" sign on a tree.  Take the left hand fork and follow the "Trail" signs 77 paces to the Jackson Creek footbridge.  From the west end of the bridge walk 20 paces slightly uphill at 280 degrees magnetic to the double trunked oak.  Look on the back side of the tree inside the burned area  and under a pile of moveable rocks.  The tree is on the south side of  Jackson Creek.  This is an orphan box,  so we would appreciate your help in maintaining it.<br/>
