congratulations for their One Year Anniversary. (I even have the stamp <br/>
to prove it! lol) I came into this group just recently but have been <br/>
sooo impressed by the caliber of these boxers. Great boxes...great <br/>
people...and best of all they set a great example for new boxers. I <br/>
recently attended the One Year Anniversary Party hosted by Paul in SF <br/>
and his family and neighbors in Oriskany, NY.  They made special boxes <br/>
for us but were generous enough to leave some in place to encourage <br/>
other boxers to visit the area. I highly recommend "The<br/>
-------, The Baker, The Candlestick Maker."  Clever and lots of FUN!!<br/>
<br/>
When I first checked boxes back in 1998-99...there were only 3 boxes in <br/>
my area. Through the efforts of LBCNY boxers, there are now over 150!! <br/>
The group continues to grow and hosts visiting boxers from all over the <br/>
country.  I am proud to be a part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the founder, Paul in SF..he truly is an inspiration and a <br/>
generous bi-coastal boxer.<br/>
