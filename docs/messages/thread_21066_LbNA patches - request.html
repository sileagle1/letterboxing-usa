   I'm not set up for PayPal and don't even know how I'd go about getting it <br/>
set up.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
"Just to give you an idea, here's what I'm looking at for the order:<br/>
F100 - Stephanie;   F100 - Wyatt; F100 - Angel; P25 - Rick; P50 - Jeff; and <br/>
my own P100 and F100; Plus I'd like to have 10 of the LbNA logo patches. "<br/>
<br/>
The order for 10 LbNA logo patches would come to $17.50 and can be filled by <br/>
me as soon as I receive it from you<br/>
....<br/>
but<br/>
...<br/>
the merit badge order should be sent to Chris' Creations .  I don't think <br/>
she's set up for paypal either. It looks like your merit badge order would come <br/>
to  $19.25 for 7 merit badges.<br/>
<br/>
The updates link has the newer lower prices and the correct ordering <br/>
information ...Go to this link:<br/>
 LbNA regalia updates <br/>
http://hometown.aol.com/mohmers/myhomepage/business.html<br/>
for the latest updates.<br/>
No need to pay extra for the S&amp;H...just include a self addressed envelope <br/>
with the correct postage.  For the patches and 3 stamps for the badges will <br/>
probably do.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this information helps and hasn't confused you.  Chris' email address is <br/>
also available at the link.<br/>
<br/>
Once again, I apologize that the LbNA Regalia page isn't up to date.  Wes <br/>
hasn't had the chance to get to it yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas,<br/>

&gt; Hello Kay:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the effort you put into the patch service for the rest of us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering if you take would PayPal? I'd love to get some<br/>
&gt; stocking stuffers in time for the little gift exchange we have planned<br/>
&gt; for the kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd be more than happy to add on something for the cost of packaging<br/>
&gt; and shipping, if you'd be willing to accept a PayPal payment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just to give you an idea, here's what I'm looking at for the order:<br/>
&gt; F100 - Stephanie<br/>
&gt; F100 - Wyatt<br/>
&gt; F100 - Angel<br/>
&gt; P25 - Rick<br/>
&gt; P50 - Jeff<br/>
&gt; and my own P100 and F100<br/>
&gt; Plus I'd like to have 10 of the LbNA logo patches. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That would be around $45 and in order to get them in time for the gift<br/>
&gt; exchange party I'd be glad to pay you $55 as compensation for the<br/>
&gt; extra work you'd have to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please let me know. (Also just so we're both understanding ... I do<br/>
&gt; know that this is NOT an order and I promise NOT to get upset if no<br/>
&gt; patches show up .. grin ... can you tell I've worked with people<br/>
&gt; online before?)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are agreeable, I'll PayPal you the money today.  If not, then<br/>
&gt; ASAP I'll want to get out a money order, or a check if you'll take one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for considering my request.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy!<br/>

Dear Kay:<br/>
<br/>
Oh my goodness. Oh dear. Oh rats!<br/>
<br/>
You blew my gift surprise big time by putting a copy of your reply to<br/>
me on the big list as well as sending me a private reply. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info anyway, I appreciate that you took time to respond<br/>
but now that the cat is out of the bag, I'm going to think about this<br/>
for a minute and get my emotions back in order before I make a final<br/>
decision.<br/>
