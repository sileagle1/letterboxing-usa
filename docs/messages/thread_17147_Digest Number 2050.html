Subject: Postal Letterboxes<br/>
<br/>
In an attempt to start another thread that hopefully won't erupt in flames,<br/>
I'd like to share something.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I placed the Aztec Gold into the mail to ship it across to the<br/>
first recipient.  This is what the post office charge and what they would<br/>
have charged:<br/>
<br/>
Express Mail        (Overnight)        $21.05<br/>
Priority Mail        (2 Days)            $8.55<br/>
Parcel Post            (8 days)        $6.32<br/>
<br/>
Delivery Confirmation = .45<br/>
<br/>
I sent it Priority Mail, with delivery confirmation for a grand total of<br/>
$9.00.  Now, what does my nine bucks get me? Nothing.  I can't track it,<br/>
only Express Mail can be tracked and I wasn't going to pay $21.00 to do<br/>
that. All I get is delivery confirmation and, although that's helpful, I<br/>
want to know where it is, where it's going, where it's help up at, etc, etc.<br/>
Now, checking the UPS website:<br/>
<br/>
UPS 2nd Day            (2 Business Days)                    $14.57<br/>
UPS 3 Day Select    (3 Business Days)                    $12.33<br/>
UPS Ground                (5 business Days)                 $8.07<br/>
<br/>
5 Business days and eight dollars and I get to track it all the way on it's<br/>
journey.  And, since I am anal about things like this, for me, in the<br/>
future, I'll be using UPS.<br/>
<br/>
And, speaking of the Aztec Gold Postal Letterbox, feel free, everyone, to<br/>
stop by and take a look at it's travels at:<br/>
