                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wild Woman,  Of course you are very right about educating people here about letterboxing.  Duh,  I found out about letterboxing by a chance reading of an aticle while visiting my brother in Coasta Mesa, Ca.  So why am I so slow at figuring out what you point out?  Tunnel vision I guess.  Will try to make some contacts with writer types and see what happens.  In the mean time I`ll keep carving stamps and planting boxes.  Speaking of boxes, I have found good quality boxes at a couple of our $ stores.  They buy out invetorys from failing businesse and sell them cheep.  Got 4 Rubbermade boxes for $.99 ea.  They sell for triple that at Albertsons  Thanks for the help.  Hopefully next week iin Seatle we`ll get a few finds under our belts.  Maybe we need Amana from Seattle to make a trip here.  She seems to be every place else!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great--as people on this list tend to say, "Plant 'em and they will come."  <br/>
If you happen to know a writer, they might be into querying a <br/>
magazine/newspaper--but keep in mind that you can always suggest the topic to <br/>
your local paper/radio or TV station/regional magazine.  Those folks are <br/>
often looking for stories, and the fact that a reader/listener/local person <br/>
suggests the idea carries some weight.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
