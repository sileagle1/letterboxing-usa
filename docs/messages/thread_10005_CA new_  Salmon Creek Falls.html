One of the most picturesque waterfalls on the central CA coast, <br/>
Salmon Creek Falls is worth visiting any time of year.<br/>
The falls are within sight of spectacular State Highway 1, 2.2 miles <br/>
north of the San Luis Obispo County line, on the point of a hairpin <br/>
curve.  From the dirt parking area along the road, walk across the <br/>
bridge to the trailhead on the south side of the creek.  Just past <br/>
the trailhead sign, you'll pass through a wooden gate.  Just inside <br/>
the gate, a side trail leads down toward the stream.  Proceed 10 <br/>
paces down this trail.  On your right is a large tree with a hole in <br/>
the trunk, about 3' up.  Grab the branch sticking out of the hole, &amp; <br/>
carefully pull the string attached to the branch.<br/>
Be discreet, as you will be visible to hikers on the main trail above <br/>
you.<br/>
On to the falls!  After stamping in, return to the main trail above <br/>
you, &amp; continue up-canyon for several minutes.  You'll find another <br/>
side trail which leads down to the base of the falls (the best view), <br/>
or you may continue uphill for a view from the top.<br/>
