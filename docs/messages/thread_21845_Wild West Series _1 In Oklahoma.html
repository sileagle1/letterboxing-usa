This box was done by Sticker and Thumbprint Bandit.  It was such a nice <br/>
stroll into a beautiful, unknown paradise.  You know, I lived in that <br/>
area for nearly 6 years and had no idea that street was even there <br/>
(morgan), much less the pretty woods tucked beneath the new turnpike.  <br/>
There was some poison ivy, but I think I managed to get out unscathed <br/>
and unblistered!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks guys,<br/>
