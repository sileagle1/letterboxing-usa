My kids and I started with the FPP (Frying Pan Park) box, nearest our <br/>
home in NoVA, one day this June.  We brought two other curious mom-kid <br/>
pairs along.  Had fun.  Some of the early directions were confusing, as <br/>
there are many horse jumps at FPP, but we enjoyed the very pretty walk.  <br/>
Hadn't been to that part of the park before.  WARNING:  cannot go the <br/>
whole way with a stroller or wagon; must abandon it enroute &amp; get it <br/>
again on the way back (or have someone help you carry it over roots &amp; <br/>
across the creek mentioned in the clues)!!!  Preschoolers and younger <br/>
will need assistance at the creek.  Box is near something of a busy <br/>
walking trail for nearby developments.  Lots o' teens cutting through <br/>
near the box.  Fun stamp.  Box was soggy; we dried it off as best we <br/>
could.  Needs a new box and/or plastic bags.  Just joined the list this <br/>
week, so am reporting its condition now.  Am also trying to think of a <br/>
good spot for a second FPP box.<br/>
<br/>
Have a list printed out of others near our home, easy ones especially <br/>
(kids are young), and am trying to get my hubby to come along.  He needs <br/>
to test his GPS to see if it still works, as he's expressed interest in <br/>
geocaching. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome Arielle!  It sounds like you are off to a great start!  We had a <br/>
little confusion with the start of the Frying Pan Park clues too.  We kept <br/>
starting and then realizing that we were at the wrong jumps...  Of course, <br/>
the more jumps the kids leapt over, the more fun they had!<br/>
<br/>
We have to plug our own boxes and encourage you to look for the ones we have <br/>
hidden in the Vienna area. We have little ones as well, so we plant our <br/>
boxes with them in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!  BeMa<br/>
