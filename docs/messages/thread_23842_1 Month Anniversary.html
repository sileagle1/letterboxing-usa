<br/>
Today is my one month Anniversary of letterboxing.<br/>
I found 8 boxes this past month.<br/>
I could have found 10 but I became a lazy little Angel. <br/>
(He he he he he he)<br/>
<br/>
I am almost ready to plant my first box.<br/>
I have all the ingredients ready for it except for the stamp.<br/>
I am reading up on carving a stamp.<br/>
So  whenever I get a chance to do it.<br/>
I will carve that stamp and get that box planted.<br/>
<br/>
Well  that's all the news I have for now.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to all L'boxers!!!<br/>

Have a great time letterboxing!<br/>
Someday when I get the extra money I will buy a GPS so me and my <br/>
husband can try geocashing. It sounds as fun as letterboxing.<br/>
Maybe it's funner -I don't know - yet.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings to you and your Family -<br/>
