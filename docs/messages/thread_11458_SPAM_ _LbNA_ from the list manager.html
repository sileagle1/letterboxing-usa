&gt; Some of you have noticed that trolls are sending off-topic content<br/>
&gt; to the list and the upload sections.  This stuff is obviously outside<br/>
&gt; the charter of the family-oriented hobby.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don't feed the trolls -- many use automated systems and will not<br/>
&gt; see your reply anyway.  For the most part, people have been good<br/>
&gt; about this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I've temporarily banned attachments.  I'll unban them sometime in<br/>
&gt; the future.  In the mean time, if you have letterboxing-related<br/>
&gt; attachments, please put them in the "files" or "photos" section<br/>
&gt; (this is the right thing to do anyway, but otherwise there are<br/>
&gt; legitimate reasons for attachments to be part of the game).  Note<br/>
&gt; that trolls will also be putting their stuff there, so if you are<br/>
&gt; easily bothered, check that the person who created the folder or<br/>
&gt; file or e-mail message is someone you recognize from the list before<br/>
&gt; opening it, and not imatroll_somenumbers_or_letters@yahoo.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Keep in mind that it can take up to 2 days for settings changes and<br/>
&gt; other moderator action to take effect on the group, and that the<br/>
&gt; moderators can't monitor the goings on here 24 hours a day.  I in<br/>
&gt; fact check photos and files once every month or so, so if there is<br/>
&gt; something off-topic up there, you have to send me a note.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for your understanding.  Comments, questions, and opposing<br/>
&gt; points of view are best handled off-list to the moderaters.<br/>
