                    <div class="plaintext-content">took my friend out with me.  She has been curious about letterboxing and<br/>
carved a stamp so she could make finds of her own.  As it turns out, I have<br/>
caught a bad cold (no, not SARS) while I was traveling back from the Middle<br/>
East, so I wasn't up to going out to the boxes I wanted to find.  There were<br/>
a few local ones that we could find without exertion though.<br/>
<br/>
First we went looking on behalf of A-Bear and found that the "Spirit of the<br/>
West" is indeed still there, just moved to the wrong side of the bridge.<br/>
Thanks to some that were here making some plants two weeks ago who found it.<br/>
I moved it back to the right side of the bridge.  If it continues to be a<br/>
problem, I can relocate it for A-Bear if she wants.<br/>
<br/>
This was my friend's first box, so she was excited.  She has decided to go<br/>
by the name "Rock Climber" after one of her favorite pasttimes.  So keep<br/>
your eyes out for her.<br/>
<br/>
Next we found "Flying Free" and "Idaho Falls."  I am so excited to have some<br/>
new boxes in my area!! It's so fun to have a few boxes other than your own<br/>
around.  They were both in very pleasant spots too.  Hopefully we will have<br/>
some time in the coming weeks to find "Plant One for Me, Jackson's Elk,<br/>
Thatched Mystery, Abandoned on the Moon, and The Eagle has Landed."  Man,<br/>
I'm going to put some miles on my car.  Thanks Don, Gwen, and Heather.  I am<br/>
really excited.  It will be worth the trips into WY and MT to find a few<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Until later,<br/>
