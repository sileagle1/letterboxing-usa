                    <div class="plaintext-content">After a couple of days in the Bay Area, I went south to Anaheim and <br/>
environs and recorded some more finds:<br/>
<br/>
I found Real Seal at Seal Beach and Titan in Fullerton, and Shore Bird and <br/>
Pelican at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. These were all in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
At dusk, I trekked down the cliffs in San Pedro to find the Palo Verde box. <br/>
It was dark as I trekked back up, which made for an interesting hike.... <br/>
Amazing view from the top, though it did make my knees a bit wobbly!<br/>
<br/>
In Long Beach, I found the Signal Hill box -- which will need a new log <br/>
very soon, the current log only has a couple of pages left -- and the <br/>
"Catching Some Sun in the Quad" and "49er Mascot" at Cal State. I hadn't <br/>
printed the directions for the 3rd box in that series so I couldn't grab <br/>
that one too. By chance, I had parked very near the 2nd box without even <br/>
knowing it! It was after dark when I found both those boxes, which made my <br/>
search much less obvious, even though there were lots of students around.<br/>
<br/>
The Easter Bunny box in Fullerton is gone. This was reported previously on <br/>
the list, but the clues don't reflect its MIA status.<br/>
