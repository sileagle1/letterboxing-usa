What a treat to see Chuck and Molly reach their PFX 500 count <br/>
yesterday as we ran around with them collecting  "Presidential <br/>
Animals"!!! So much fun to see folks reach goals they've worked <br/>
hard for! Chuck has done a great job planting boxes along the<br/>
railroad trails and other interesting spots in northeastern CT. <br/>
We're also pretty sure that Alan Letterboxer 2002 (of great comic <br/>
strip carving fame) and Bill Haalck (of bike trail plant fame), and<br/>
perhaps several others have reached PFX 500 by now, so just <br/>
send us your completion dates and we'll be glad to add your <br/>
names to this particular list where people get credit not only for <br/>
how many boxes they find, but for how many boxes they plant <br/>
and how many people they meet as well! (see message 7772) <br/>
Oh, just re-checked our e-mail and there's a brand new <br/>
messsage in from Music Woman that she just reached PFX 500 <br/>
last Wednesday in Wallingford,CT! So, here's one more person <br/>
to welcome to the club and soon there'll be more and more <br/>
reaching this special milestone!<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations to all of you!<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
