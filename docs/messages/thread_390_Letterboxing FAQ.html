Right On!!  I absolutely LOVE this webpage!!  This, in my honest, unbiased<br/>
opinion is the most concise and perfectly worded source of information about<br/>
the American letterboxing scene that is available on the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
Dan, how prominently can this be worked into the website? Personally, I think<br/>
it needs to be one of the first things a newcomer finds in their search for<br/>
understanding.  I'm sure minor modifications would be needed in both Randy's<br/>
FAQ and the current website in order to accomplish this, but (if everyone is<br/>
willing) I'd love to see this become a prominent part of the Letterboxing USA<br/>
domain.<br/>
<br/>
As for the opinions, Randy, I strongly agree with you on ALL accounts.  I have<br/>
enjoyed many at-length conversations with a number of the most devout<br/>
letterboxers in Dartmoor.  I very much want to see the honorable traditions of<br/>
British letterboxing upheld in every way possible as we absorb this hobby into<br/>
our culture.  I think the attitude expressed in your FAQ accomplishes this<br/>
very well.  Myself, being somewhat of an environmental activist, I also think<br/>
you have responsibly dealt with many issues that could cause problems and<br/>
jeopardize the acceptance of our hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I salute this wonderful endeavor, and give it my complete and total approval,<br/>
blessing, and recommendation.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Der Mad Stamper<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; What Organized Challenges or Hunts are There?<br/>
None that I know of, but there are several informal challenges in place. For<br/>
example, you can try to be the first to collect 100 stamps from US boxes, or<br/>
try to collect the stamp of the first box in each state, etc., or collect all<br/>
the stamp images of a particular artist.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Suggestion:<br/>
We start a "webring" of letterbox stamp artists, connecting everyone's<br/>
personal webpages, each of which contains links to boxes with stamps that we<br/>
carved.<br/>
<br/>
If we did this, I would be happy to host pages for those who don't have their<br/>
own webspace.  Does this sound like fun? ... or is it too much?<br/>

Any ideas for the best way to do this?  ...Randy? ...Dan?<br/>

I was never sure the purpose of the "Internet" push button at the top of <br/>
the page on the right.  You are welcome to put the link there in place of<br/>
that, if you want, or where ever you want, really.  <br/>

<br/>
See http://www.webring.org.  Funny, I was thinking the exact same thing <br/>
the other day.  It is customary, I guess, for webring logos to be at the<br/>
bottom of the page.  If we start a webring for L-USA, I think we should <br/>
consider taking the two lower maps off the main page.  Page load is getting <br/>
slow now with the new logo (which looks cool, BTW), and the webring logo<br/>
will be too far down if those maps remain.  Just my two cents.<br/>

<br/>
I've noted that there are a few misc. links on the current ABOUT page that<br/>
might be worth preserving, but don't really merit being added to Randy's FAQ.<br/>
Most of them have to do with carving stamps.  I would like to transfer them<br/>
over to my Stamp Carving pages, if no one objects.  <br/>
<br/>
I've been getting lots of responses regarding my carving pages from people who<br/>
are just discovering the art of stamping as a result of their interest in<br/>
letterboxing.  I'm going to start trying to expand on these pages in the near<br/>
future, to answer some of the questions I've encountered and develop a<br/>
comprehensive resource for letterbox stamp carvers.  <br/>
<br/>
Please note, I'll not be competing with the Carving Consortium, in any way.<br/>
When it comes to rubber stamp artistry, the folks in that group are beyond<br/>
compare!!  I'm going to try and focus a bit more on the practical side, for<br/>
those people who don't consider themselves to be the 'artistic' type, but want<br/>
to try their hand at stamp carving for the sake of LETTERBOXING.  Of course,<br/>
any resources I provide will be commercial free and available for direct<br/>
linking to the L-USA website, as well as the Carving Consortium site.<br/>
<br/>
In particular, I love the various comments that appear on the ABOUT page that<br/>
have been sent in by talk list members offering carving tips and other<br/>
tidbits.  If you experienced carvers have any other hints that you'd like to<br/>
share with newcomers to the hobby, send them to me, and I'll work them into my<br/>
revisions (giving full credit to the artists who supply the tips, of course.)<br/>
I want to show people the methods of carving, provide an overview of carving<br/>
mediums available and sources for them, and maybe throw in a few words about<br/>
letterbox stamp design.<br/>
<br/>
All relevant comments will be enthusiastically entertained!!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">With Randy's permission I would like to copy his FAQ into the about<br/>
and/or the FAQ portion of the Letterboxing USA site.  You will notice<br/>
that the address right now is http://www.letterboxing.org/faq.html.<br/>
On our site it would be http://www.pclink.com/elf/backgrnd.htm.<br/>
This is academic to most people, but I thought now would be a good<br/>
time to bring it up.  Eventually, I'd like to see the clues, maps<br/>
and all other info moved over to Randy's server.  There is one slight<br/>
problem though.  His server is on a slow link.  The FAQ page loads<br/>
reasonably well because it is text only.  The maps will not fair as<br/>
well.  So I'm just looking ahead and looking forward to a time when<br/>
the name www.letterboxing.org will precede all of our links and maps.<br/>
<br/>
I view it as more than symbolic that we share a common repository<br/>
for our clues and other information that so many people have made <br/>
contributions toward.  It says something about us.  Its non-profit.<br/>
Its voluntary.  Its for fun.  It will be (and already is) really,<br/>
really cool!  What more can I say?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I don't think I have stated on the list how nice I think<br/>
the FAQ list turned out.  I think Randy did it craftily and expertly.<br/>
I'm really proud of what he did.  I like the text and the fact that<br/>
it is thorough and concise and professionally worded.  It will make<br/>
us look like we are not just a bunch of rubes.  Thank you Randy!<br/>

&gt;  Nice work on the FAQ page! it si great to have all that info pulled<br/>
&gt;  together in one place!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  It did take quite a while to load, which is probably my modem and<br/>
&gt;  crowded computer. Did anyone else experience this?<br/>

&gt;  Not long to load for me. And I was EXTREMELY impressed with the information<br/>
&gt;  presented here. Thanks so much!!!!!  I vote for making it a prominant part of<br/>
&gt;  the web page.<br/>
