new, bouncing baby cuckoo box named "Get Outta My Box."  This gem is <br/>
hidden somewhere in the state of Maryland in a park near you.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have never found a cuckoo clue before, we made <br/>
up our own rules and included them so you will have no problem <br/>
figuring out how to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
So get on out there and find the clue before it moves again!<br/>
