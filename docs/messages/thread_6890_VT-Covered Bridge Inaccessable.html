The Covered Bridge letterbox in Danville, VT (Caledonia County) will be out of<br/>

The bridge is being repaired, and access to the letterbox  has been blocked.<br/>

Beth and I just found and stamped in your box at The Covered Bridge <br/>
on August 14th!  It is true the road is under construction and they <br/>
have literally moved the entire old bridge from its location over the <br/>
river to the side of the road, but despite this we were still able to <br/>
follow your clues as written and find the box.  I rehid the box a bit <br/>
better as it was partially in view from above.<br/>
<br/>
In our opinion, the stamp you carved for this letterbox is WELL worth <br/>
any additional effort as it is quite a beautiful stamp!  For those <br/>
who wish to add this great stamp to their collection, we suggest you <br/>
visit the site on a weekend when the workers are not there, as we did <br/>
which worked out quite nicely.  There are no tresspassing signs near <br/>
the heavy machinery, but you can easily get to the box without having <br/>
to go near any machinery.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there are 2 other nearby boxes also provided by David that will <br/>
have you signing out old favorite tunes!  It was 100 degrees and so <br/>
humid out you could cut the air with a knife when we found these <br/>
boxes, so don't let the weather or a little construction keep you out.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>

other letterboxers I ran into over the weekend:<br/>
<br/>
While The Covered Bridge in Danville, VT may be under construction and<br/>
therefore a little... different than usual, the West Arlington, VT covered<br/>
bridge is still in perfect working shape.  As is it's box. :)<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there is more than one box relating to a covered bridge in VT, hence<br/>
the confusion...  <br/>
