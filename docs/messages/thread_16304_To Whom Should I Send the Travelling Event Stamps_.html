<br/>
I realize ahead of time this is none of my buisness as I am not holding the<br/>
event, but considering that I *might* possibly be able to make it if<br/>
Iron`Bear is kind enough to hold me up while we walk to tables and such I<br/>
vote that the SLO Travelling Event Stamps get sent to Team Ravenyhaus for<br/>
the Fright Fest Event in Washington.  I think that since the SLO event was<br/>
hosted by members of Googled and Fright Fest is being hosted by members of<br/>
Googled as well as being atteneded by members of Googed (Iron`Bear and<br/>
myself hopefully) that would just make for a peachy keen place to send those<br/>
Travellers first.<br/>
<br/>
Thats my two cents, Team Ravenyhaus please step up and forward your<br/>
address!!!<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>
