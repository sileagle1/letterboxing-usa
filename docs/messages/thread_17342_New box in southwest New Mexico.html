<br/>
Lordsburg Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: December 25, 2003<br/>
State:  New Mexico<br/>
County:   Hidalgo<br/>
Nearest city:  Lordsburg<br/>
Difficulty:   Clues &amp; walk   very easy<br/>
<br/>
This box is for weary travelers who need to stop and stretch their<br/>
legs.  It is located at the New Mexico Visitor Information Center and<br/>
Rest Area.  From I-10 take Exit 20 and go to the Information Center on<br/>
the south side of the interstate highway and park there.<br/>
<br/>
At the "Pet Area" sign face west and walk at about 350 degrees to a<br/>
lone moderate size Yucca cluster.  The box is at the base of the Yucca<br/>
under a small concrete slab.<br/>
<br/>
This is a very public and highly visible site; so, please be very<br/>
discreet when retrieving and re-hiding the box.<br/>
<br/>
I will not be able to check on this box; so, please let me know if you<br/>
find it.  Also, let me know if it is missing so that I can delete the<br/>
clues:<br/>

<br/>
This is the first box in my "I-10 Series".<br/>
