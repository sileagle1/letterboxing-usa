    Without being *too* politically correct, why do you have to slam<br/>
Holyoke? Have you seen Mountain Park lately? Not the best location<br/>
for a letterbox hunt, but the placers gave it a shot anyways. As for<br/>
the others, could be vandalism, but I've seen that at more than a<br/>
few boxes in Western MA/Northern CT .<br/>

&gt; Not to sound TOO crude, but it IS Holyoke afterall :/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Really sad to hear, those boxes were going to come up in my<br/>
searches <br/>
&gt; soon :(<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi all! I'm never sure whether my "message to placer" e-mails get <br/>
&gt; &gt; through since I've sent half a dozen and never gotten a response. <br/>
&gt; So <br/>
&gt; &gt; I thought I'd post here, in case anyone is planning on making a <br/>
&gt; trip <br/>
&gt; &gt; to search for these boxes.  For the "Mountain Park" series, boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; #1, #2, and #5 are all missing (as of 10/9/04). The stamp in box <br/>
&gt; #4 <br/>
&gt; &gt; has been damaged. For the boxes planted in Ashley Reservoir (as<br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; 10/10/04), "Horse-escape" was vandelized. I found the lid, the<br/>
ink <br/>
&gt; &gt; pad, a horse sticker, and a plastic bag, but nothing else.<br/>
"Golden <br/>
&gt; &gt; Faun" was also vandelized. I found all parts except the log book. <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; put everything back together the best I could and rehid the box<br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the same location. For the "Ladybuggy" box hidden in Chmura Park, <br/>
&gt; &gt; this box is missing (as of 10/10/04). It seems like a <br/>
&gt; &gt; disproportionatly large amount of Hoyoke boxes are damaged or <br/>
&gt; &gt; missing. Tough city!<br/>
