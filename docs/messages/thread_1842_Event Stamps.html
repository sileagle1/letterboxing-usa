I'm so glad that you liked my stamp and am flatterd that you though it<br/>
was a Drew Clan creation.  That was actually only the third stamp I have<br/>
ever carved; I also carved the snowflake pictured with the event<br/>
stamps.  My first stamp is appropriately themed and destined to be<br/>
placed at Dinosaur State Park in Rocky Hill, CT (as soon as I can get a<br/>
chance to get our there - I know I've been saying that for a while now<br/>
Annie!)  Your praise will encourage me to keep carving.<br/>

<div>Greetings,</div>
<div>Since I have only recently seen the "E" designation along with 
the P&amp;F and all sorts of other letters I am wondering, is it incorrect to

event stamp itself -- stamp that was carved for the event and <br/>
everyone takes an image of, but it is not hidden -- and that the <br/>
boxes you find while at the event would just be regular ole "F"'s.<br/>
<br/>
Since I have not been to an event, I don't know for certain.  I am <br/>
with you, it seems a lot easier and uncomplicated just to do the <br/>
standard PFX count and make appropriate notations as to the specifics <br/>
in my log book.  It's just a matter of preference.<br/>

If it has a stamp and a book and is not a persons personal stamp, it is a find if you stamp that book and use that stamp to stamp your book. I count the old original PFX.

<br/>
I don't count them as finds.  I haven't used clues to "find" them.  <br/>
There's no box that has a logbook and stamp.  In fact, there's not <br/>
even a logbook for it!  So I count them as event stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Now if somebody thought it was a cool idea to actually HIDE the <br/>
event stamp at the event location then provide clues for it--that <br/>
would be a different matter....<br/>
<br/>
But basically, it's not really important how you count any of the <br/>
stamps you 'find'.  Count it any way that feels right to you.  It's not <br/>
like the numbers have some cosmic importance anyhow, which <br/>
is why I don't post my PFXE counts with my signature.  It really <br/>
doesn't matter in the end.  I rarely know the EXACT number of <br/>
placed and finds without going to my logbook and counting them <br/>
all up.  <br/>
