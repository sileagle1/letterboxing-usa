                    <div class="plaintext-content">We recently discovered a cool contraption called a color block or <br/>
color wheel.  Actually, Patrick and Amy had one and we thought it was <br/>
a cool idea. I've also seen a similar ink pad in B'Fly's posession.  <br/>
<br/>
Where am I going with this? Well, lots of boxes - especially micro's <br/>
don't have their own ink. Also, we've found several boxes recently <br/>
that the ink was dry or runny - no fault of the owner!  Anyways, <br/>
these color wheels have 8 or so colors on them. We bought the rainbow <br/>
colors one (i've also seen shades of blue/burgundy and one that had <br/>
metallics). Each color can be detached from the wheel and used on a <br/>
stamp. I suppose you could also use it as a whole to make rainbow <br/>
prints too?  The ink is a nice quality, goes on even, and makes a <br/>
fine print.  <br/>
<br/>
We used to carry just blue and brown - the color of our signature <br/>
stamps. Unfortunately every time we found a box with no ink we got a <br/>
blue of brown image.  The versatility of the color wheel is nice to <br/>
have! <br/>
<br/>
We got our at AC Moore for around $16.  I'm sure you can bargain <br/>
online and comparison shop at different stamp and craft stores.  A <br/>
wise purchase nonetheless.  And it beats carryng lots of ink pads <br/>
around! <br/>

You mean that some people actually expect to find ink pads in the <br/>
letterboxes? Come on now! It does boggle one's imagination that folks <br/>
are that dependent upon others' goodwill. And as they said, the ink <br/>
could be all sorts of yucky with environmental influence.<br/>
<br/>
Please, teach new 'boxers to bring their own stamp pads!<br/>

It's an east coast/midwest thing, Sir B.  While it's true that it confounds us westerners how those people manage, they do indeed include inkpads in their boxes.  They somehow seem to have placed hundreds of 'em, in fact.  Go figure.<br/>

Washington in addition to some of the boxes we've found in Ohio, <br/>
Maryland, New Jersey &amp; New York--so it's not really a regional <br/>
thing.  Personally, I don't do it because I'm frugal--I guess this <br/>
is why we got into letterboxing in lieu of paying for the annual zoo <br/>
pass!!!  ;)<br/>
