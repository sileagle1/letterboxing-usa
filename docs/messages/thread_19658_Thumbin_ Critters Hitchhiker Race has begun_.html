And there are prizes!  And some must pass through the Midwest. <br/>
What more can you ask for?<br/>
<br/>
As opposed to traditional hitchhiker etiquette, it looks as if you <br/>
want to publicize the locations where the critters are left to move <br/>
them along faster, is that right?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being so creative.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, if I am told where a racer was left, I will list it on the blog. <br/>
I feel that's the best chance any one of them has to get as far as <br/>
they can. However, some may feel that this is wrong and may not want <br/>
to diclose the location where they left a racer, and that's fine, <br/>
too. But that could be the difference between winning and losing :)  <br/>
