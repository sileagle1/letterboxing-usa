placed by Ryan)  yesterday, and snagged the box, hot on the heels of the<br/>
Traveling Circus.  This was a great stamp, in a great location.  Even<br/>
though we didn't have multicolor pens with us, we were able to take<br/>
advantage of the coloring job of the previous stampers and got a<br/>
beautiful multicolor image.<br/>
<br/>
We will have to go back again and hike around the area and explore more<br/>
of the island.<br/>
