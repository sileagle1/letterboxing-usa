<div>Hello to all,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, we had a HOT time hunting out the mystery 
locations of these wonderful boxes left by the Drew clan. 
<div>Who turned the oven on today? We 
were only able to score two of the five. We had 
run out of gas zig zagging all over the grounds. </div></div>
<div>
<div>Thanks Drew's.... we'll be back for sure.</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>How did you make out Ann and Kathryn? It was very 
nice running into you up there. Hope you had better luck than us.</div>

<div>   Many thanks from the Torreys to the Drew clan, as 
well.  Thoroughly enjoyed the Harry Potter series.  I'm just surprised 
that more people hadn't been there!</div>
<div>    Great to run into ESAK on the way.  
Sorry you guys missed the other boxes.  We did 
find all five, but managed to take the "scenic" route back, as we continued on 
the blue trail that my friends thought hooked back up to yellow.  
Needless to say, it did not.  Did a little bushwacking towards the end and 
found the right trail.  It was hot!  Felt good to get out, though, and 
we enjoyed exchanging stamps with your family.   Ann &amp;
