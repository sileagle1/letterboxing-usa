                     Princess Turtle's 13th Birthday<br/>
<br/>
                  ************* Chapter 3 *************<br/>
<br/>
       Location - Lake Kittamaqundi, opposite the Columbia Mall,<br/>
                  Columbia, MD<br/>
       County - Howard<br/>
       Planted by - Psychomommy and Princess Turtle<br/>
       Easy walk approx. 1 mile.<br/>
       Park in the lots/garage on Wincopin Circle<br/>
<br/>
     Spring had arrived, Stanley and his Princess were awakening from the <br/>
long, cold, snowy winter. On one of his strolls, Stanley met up with <br/>
Firefly, Squirrel, and a couple that called themselves Celtic Pride. Word <br/>
had it that Lady Prisspot was coming to town. Excitement filled the air! <br/>
Knowing that Princess Turtle's birthday was coming up, Stanley wanted to <br/>
have a party. He choose a lovely nearby lake for the big event. Friends came <br/>
from far and wide. Her quirky relatives, The Lizardbuttfamily, from <br/>
California and Mary, the daughter of the Old Dominion, from Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
#1 Yum, Yum Chocolate Cake<br/>
<br/>
    They met at the Tomato Palace. Heading left past the Asian decor, they <br/>
followed a paved path. One bridge, two bridge leads to the path that <br/>
everyone calls No Path. Being turtles they had to take a rest at the first <br/>
park bench. You don't have to, you can stay on No Path.<br/>
    They had to jump the rocky creek and then to their dismay another. Now <br/>
they were on an island. Sitting on the big boulder to their right was the <br/>
Appledumpling Gang. Cat had made a beautiful cake for the birthday party. <br/>
Under the boulder, facing the lake and behind small rocks is your slice of <br/>
cake!<br/>
<br/>
#2 Make a Wish<br/>
<br/>
    Sarah and Tammy from the Gang were deep in discussion. Sarah said, "this <br/>
island is a bit odoriferous!" Tammy's response was, "it smells like perfume <br/>
to me!" Sarah said that up ahead was a lovely garden and if she stayed 1 <br/>
more minute she would barf all over Tammy. All agreed (but Tammy), so off <br/>
they traveled down the rocky path.<br/>
    Sure enough, it was like the movie The Wizard of Oz. The dark woods <br/>
opened up to a beautiful garden. Everyone gathered at the third bench.<br/>
A lovely spot to view the herons. Behind them was the dark woods. Stanley <br/>
told his love that she should make her wish at the tree behind the tree of <br/>
3. So Princess Turtle carefully made her wish as she steered clear from the <br/>
evil Poison Ivy.<br/>
<br/>
#3 Crowning the Princess<br/>
<br/>
    Oh, how she hoped her wish would come true. It was getting late, the <br/>
party was breaking up, so everyone continued down the path. They dumped all <br/>
their trash into the 1st trash bin. Princess Turtle thought she saw <br/>
something glistening off to her left. Bookworm said it was just the river <br/>
sparkling in the setting sunlight. No! She insisted they all follow her. <br/>
