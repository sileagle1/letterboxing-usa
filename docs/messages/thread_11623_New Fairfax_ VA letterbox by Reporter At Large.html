Dunn Loring Park <br/>
Dunn Loring, Va. <br/>

Easy <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dunn Loring Park is easy to reach by car, or on foot from the Metro <br/>
(Dunn Loring stop to the south), or the WO&amp;D Trail (at the Gallows Rd <br/>
crossing to the north). There is a parking lot with entrances on <br/>
Gallows Rd, and trails that enter from both sides. It's a pocket <br/>
park, no chance of getting lost. <br/>
<br/>
 If you've found Reiki, you are already on the right track. Either <br/>
way, proceed to the field of dreams. Not the prominent courts where <br/>
would-be Bjorn Borgs and Martina Navratilovas or Magic Johnsons and <br/>
Chamique Holdsclaws roam, but the mini field tucked away from the <br/>
mainstream where miniature Cal Ripkens ply their dreams. <br/>
<br/>
 Stand at the point where the Babe called his shot. Look in the <br/>
direction he pointed, and follow Carlton Fisk's dance of jubilation <br/>
down the line to the bag of Buckner's woe. From there take the number <br/>
of steps on Mickey Mantle's jersey (short steps) to a large, straight <br/>
tree that marks the beginning of serious foul territory. Watch the <br/>
briars and step over the fallen log beyond it. Take the number of <br/>
steps (again, short ones) that's contained in the name of the catcher <br/>
in Abbott and Costello's classic "Who's on First?" and you'll find <br/>
yourself practically on top of a tree listing about 45 degrees to the <br/>
right. Look in the snag/stump adjacent to it to find the prize of the <br/>
boys of summer. <br/>
