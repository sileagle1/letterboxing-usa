There probably won?t be too much overlapping of letterboxers though, since I?m on the Left Coast.  Gung Hay Fat Chow!<br/>
<br/>
The Year of the Ram 4701<br/>
Shoreline Park<br/>
City:  Alameda<br/>
(Alameda County, CA)<br/>
<br/>
planted by PrincessLea on February 10, 2003<br/>
terrain - extremely level paved trail - bicycles are permitted<br/>
rountrip distance - about 1 1/2 miles?<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  880 freeway exit High Street - proceed east on High Street toward the Bay.  You will cross over a bridge and come into the town of Alameda.  Turn left at the first stoplight past the bridge onto Fernside Ave.  Follow this until it dead ends into Otis St.  You will make a left at the T and go over another bridge - stay in the right lane and veer off onto Island Drive right after the bridge.  Take the immediate right onto Veterans Ct. and park at the end of the cul de sac.<br/>
<br/>
Take the trail marked San Francisco Bay Trail.  You?ll go past the health club, the grey houses and the brown houses and arrive at a small recreational area.  You should be able to see the Bay Bridge in the distance.  Go to the second BBQ area (consisting of a single picnic table) - there is a bushy Cypress tree on the right (water) side of the dirt path.  Behind it, a little to the left (but closer than the wooden bench) is a hollow log.  The letterbox is inside on the right side.<br/>
<br/>
This path is heavily used by dog walkers and joggers, but back by the log you should be fairly well concealed; as always please be discreet and conceal the letterbox well when you are finished.<br/>
