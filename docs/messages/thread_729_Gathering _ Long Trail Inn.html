A few ruminations about a wonderfull letterboxing weekend  -<br/>
but first -<br/>
<br/>
This delay has been computer-gremlin-driven.  We lost<br/>
several hundred e-mails, and couldn't retain new posts,<br/>
including mostly new e-group posts. As it turned you, lost<br/>
sectors in the hard drive kept Sue busy all Monday and most<br/>
of Tuesday. I mention this only as John De Wolf had a<br/>
problem of some sort at the same time - any others had any<br/>
e-groups-related mysteries?<br/>
<br/>
Sue and I arrived at Long Trail Inn at about 2 pm Sat.,<br/>
alas, the group was off box hunting (Woodstock<br/>
Valley-Questing). So, Sue pulled out the carving tools and<br/>
whipped off a Letterbox Stamp in honor of James P. Taylor,<br/>
LT visionary and GMC founder. I went up the trail so scout<br/>
for a good spot, and got back just in time to start the<br/>
McGrath's Pub Letterbox searchwith the gathering group.<br/>
<br/>
I must compliment Tom on his choice the Pub/Inn, as the  is<br/>
a very friendly, cozy place. And, the staff were great - the<br/>
waitress and bartender searched as well, and, as most of the<br/>
clues were based on pub-ephemera, they were also most<br/>
helpfull.  I'm not even sure who finally solved the puzzle,<br/>
but, we were all treated to a  stamping of Tom's carved<br/>
commerative stamp. Tom, for those who haven't had the<br/>
pleasure, is a master cluesmith.<br/>
<br/>
Supper was great, the Irish band was a treat, and we all<br/>
shared personal stamp impressions and showed off our stamp<br/>
collection (alas, mine is embarrasingly small). As the<br/>
evening wore on, we became  little concerned as Bonnie still<br/>
hadn't arrived.  She finally made it, after leaving Western<br/>
Mass, over to Mt Monadnock (NH), to hike to the TOP to<br/>
collect a stamp, then over to Sherburn Pass and the Inn.  I<br/>
am impressed!<br/>
<br/>
In the am, my plan was to get up early, hide the box up the<br/>
trail a bit, and be back for breakfast. I shoulda known<br/>
better! Again, Sue to the rescue - she looked out our<br/>
bedroom window and composed a confusing litthe ditty and off<br/>
she went to hide the box. After breakfast, the search was<br/>
on, while she and I and a few others watched from the<br/>
lounge.  Fun to observe search-styles: Randy is a full-tilt<br/>
runner, interspersed from time to time with head-scratching<br/>
- bearing-reading. I should talk - it seemed so easy from<br/>
where we sat, but, after many years with Sue, I've learned<br/>
that she can be very confusing if she chooses to be!<br/>
Anyhow, it was found, and it was time to part.<br/>
<br/>
After all were gone, we rehid the box up the trail near<br/>
Maine Junction. The stamp has some added detail, just to<br/>
make it worth the hunt.  John DeWolf came back after we had<br/>
left, took the clue we left and found it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the Valley-Quest representative who came all the<br/>
way over to hand out clue books and went back for other<br/>
pressing business.  And Rae, for shooting video for much of<br/>
the time (can't wait to see some stills!).  And for those<br/>
who drove long distances to be there (Randy, John, who've I<br/>
missed?).<br/>
<br/>
Well, we'll just have to do it again -  next spring perhaps?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks to those of you who provided such nice summaries of our <br/>
week-end gathering at Killington. It was a wonderful get-together and <br/>
I too hope we can do it again soon. <br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to have it take place in Vermont again, Randy, but <br/>
my real preference would be for a state down your way. That way <br/>
southerners would have less distance to drive (and northerners would <br/>
have more new letterboxers to hunt down!).<br/>
<br/>
Rae Record was busy with her video camera all week-end, and has <br/>
posted some shots at her site. The address is<br/>

<br/>
Just in case people who were not there are interested in matching <br/>
names to faces, the who's who of the convention is as follows:<br/>
