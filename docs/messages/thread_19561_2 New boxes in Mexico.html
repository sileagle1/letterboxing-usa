<br/>
I've just returned from Mexico and have posted two nex boxes.  They <br/>
are both in Guanajuato, Guanajuato Mexico. Its a small colonial town <br/>
near San Miguel de Allende where the movie "Once Upon a Time In <br/>
Mexico" was filmed.  The clues are posted on the LBNA page but you <br/>
could also get them from me.  I took some cousins of mine along to <br/>
hide my boxes and one of them seems interested in Letterboxing.  <br/>
Hopfulling she'll start hiding some boxes in that area.  She <br/>
suggested i write clues in Spanish for the boxes i hide in Mexico  so <br/>
i've decided to make them bilingual just in case someone none English <br/>
speakers come across my boxes in Mexico and become interested in the <br/>
hobby.  I may be going back to Guanajuato in December and if i do, i <br/>
plan on hiding more boxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
