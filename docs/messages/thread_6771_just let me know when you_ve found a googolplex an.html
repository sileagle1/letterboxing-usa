                    <div class="plaintext-content">i was quite skeptical of lizardbutt truly being only<br/>
FIVE years old, as he uses more "worldly"<br/>
expressions and apparently understands subtle irony<br/>
better than most of my 35-year-old friends.<br/>

however, even my FOUR-year-old daughter knows that<br/>
lizardbutt's "L" count should be spelled<br/>
GOOGOL (not google, as in the search engine)!<br/>
<br/>
because of this elementary (pre-school?) error, i am<br/>
now convinced that he really IS five, and all his wit<br/>
and wisdom comes completely from him...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Confused! I was like that for the first couple of<br/>
&gt; days. I am still <br/>
&gt; trying to figure out what DON JACKSON's C stands<br/>
&gt; for(caves, <br/>
&gt; centipedes, ?). Anyhow, I sometimes like to play<br/>
&gt; around. L is my own <br/>
&gt; orginal. Look at some of my last posts. It's in<br/>
&gt; there for what it <br/>
&gt; stands for. Forget, I save you the time. It<br/>
stands<br/>
&gt; for the number of <br/>
&gt; lizards that I have walked by. Yes, I know that a<br/>
&gt; google is a lot for <br/>
&gt; me. But I just love that word. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Information on bencmarks(survery markers for<br/>
&gt; example)can be found at <br/>
&gt; www.geocaching.com. That is were my Mom has found<br/>
&gt; information about <br/>
&gt; benchmarks.  She also freaks out when she finds a<br/>
&gt; marker close to <br/>
&gt; where we are going to plant a letterbox. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, Don Jackson what does that C stand for?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

also more reasonable. The only thing is, unless he has really tiny <br/>

Just how many zeros are there in a googolplex?<br/>

a googol zeros!<br/>
<br/>
(a googol has 100 zeros)<br/>
<br/>
i'm sure lizzardbutt knows for sure, but i think that if every bit of <br/>
space in the known universe (and there is A LOT of empty space) were <br/>
COMPLETELY filled with electrons (and they're pretty SMALL), the <br/>
total number of electrons would be quite a bit less than a <br/>
googolplex...<br/>
<br/>
ok, now we return you to our regulary scheduled letterbox <br/>
