                    <html><body>The Moose Hill letterbox series is Â a little closer to being completely intact once again. I replaced the "Bluffs" letterbox to its original place yesterday Sept 29.
<br/>
<br/>I work at the Nature Center there and thankfully, as a letterboxer, I knew just what the 'helpful hiker' was bringing me.
<br/>
<br/>I guess someone had happened upon it and thought it was trash. I wrote "This is not trash, please replace carefully" on the box and put it back out.
<br/>
<br/>I will be posting clues to a new box in the vicinity (though not part of Lonemasswolf's Moose Hill Series). So keep an eye out.
<br/>
<br/>Also, a note to Lonemasswolf and YIMS...if you decide to re-place the Moose Hill box that has been missing from atop the hill, please mark it as "placed with permission of Moose Hill staff" so that the tower staff (state workers with the DEM) won't remove it. If you have any questions, email me privately.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks!
