I would STRONGLY ADVISE anyone considering this site have a regional <br/>
map with them.  I had a hard time finding the park and finally pulled <br/>
my local map out.  A vital road sign at an important junction is <br/>
missing.  The standard SP road signs get you away from the freeway <br/>
but then you will miss the crucial turn off to the park.  That <br/>
junction sign is missing.  Who knows how long it will be down.  I <br/>
assume not long as not only is the SP sign missing but the street <br/>
name sign is down in the bushes.<br/>
<br/>
Once there be prepared for a somewhat challenging navigation effort <br/>
to the first box.<br/>
<br/>
"Trail and Error" always crafts clues that teach you ( once again for <br/>
me) to not take for granted what something means and assume all <br/>
possible meanings of a word.<br/>
<br/>
Even when I got to the tree, the box is not where I would have <br/>
(logically) placed it.  Even that was a little challenge.<br/>
