                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi! We're new.  -Searched for our first box and seemed to be in just <br/>
the right spot after a couple of false starts, but still couldn't <br/>
find the box.  Is there any way to know whether we just didn't look <br/>
hard enough or if the box is missing or confiscated?  We tried <br/>
the "contact the placer" link on the clue site, but haven't gotten a <br/>
reply.  We're off to try again this weekend (a different site) so <br/>
maybe we'll have better luck. -Good dogs 4<br/>

One would think, but the puppies are easily distracted by squirrells <br/>
and such.   The box in question is "Don't I Wish..." planted at <br/>
Dillon Park in Hutchinson, KS.  Today we'll be searching for the <br/>
Masked Bandit in Iowa.<br/>
