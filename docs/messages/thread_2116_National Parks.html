<div>Please don't assume that all 
letterboxing will be banned from national parks. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am in the middle of 
discussions about letterboxing with the Superintendent of the Prince William 
Forest Park, a NP just south of Washington, DC. He happens to be on the 
committee for my Boy Scout Troop, and he is interested in having me put on a 
program at the park on letterboxing. This may include a series of Park sponsored 
boxes. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since we are near NPS HQ here 
in Washington, I hope this can also lead to a national dialog. I will keep 
everyone informed on the developments. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have bowed out on discussing 
geocaching with him. I feel since I am one of the LbNA webmasters I would rather 
represent LbNA.</div>

<br/>
You give us great hope!  Thanks for that message about your relationship<br/>
with your local National Park guy.  Maybe you can make some letterbox<br/>
lobbying efforts since you are so close to the power source.  We<br/>
appreciate your input and any strides you make in this regard.  Thanks<br/>
so much.  Your note is like a breath of fresh air!<br/>

in national parks. However there was a response about the fact <br/>
that there are word of mouth boxes around. How does that work? <br/>
Since they can't/shouldn't be Googled, are they mentioned here <br/>
on this message board? Or is it the kind of thing you luck into at <br/>
a meeting or event? I'm a frequent visitor to Death Valley and the <br/>
surrounding deserts. I would love the chance to do some <br/>
letterboxing in that area. Any thoughts on this?<br/>

After you have been around a while &amp; met some folks (through finding <br/>
their boxes, them finding your boxes, on the trail, etc) you might <br/>
chance upon someone saying to you "oh, have you heard about this <br/>
box..." that is a WOM clue.  Do not ask for them- they will not <br/>
arrive that way (in fact, they are nearly guaranteed not to arrive <br/>
that way).  Find some regular boxes, enjoy the game... WOM clues <br/>
will come to you in due time.<br/>
