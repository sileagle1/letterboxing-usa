through the New Hampshire woods this past weekend.<br/>

<searcher #1=""> "Have you found anything?"<br/>

&lt;#1&gt; "I'm surprized you can see anything after the ice storm we just <br/>
had!"<br/>
&lt;#2&gt; "Ya, your right."<br/>
&lt;#1&gt; "Where did you find them? They may be of some help!"<br/>
&lt;#2&gt; "Oh, they are over here."<br/>
<br/>
::: they head over to the foot prints :::<br/>
<br/>
&lt;#1&gt; "Wait, I have seen these foot prints before!"<br/>
&lt;#2&gt; "You have! Where?"<br/>
&lt;#1&gt; "These are your footprints you...."<br/>
<searcher #3=""> "Sir, come quick! I think I found something!"<br/>
<br/>
::: they all gather to that area :::<br/>
<br/>
&lt;#1&gt; "What did you find?"<br/>
&lt;#3&gt; "I found a cookie crumb!"<br/>
&lt;#1&gt; "Then he must be in the area! We must act fast!"<br/>
&lt;#2&gt; "But sir, it is much to cold for him to survive! Lastnight it <br/>
almost reached 0 degrees. There is no way he survived!"<br/>
&lt;#1&gt; "Pull yourself together!"<br/>
&lt;#3&gt; "We should probably continue searching for Jim. He has not much <br/>
time."<br/>
&lt;#1&gt; "Your right. We must work through the day to find him. Time is <br/>
running out!"<br/>
<br/>
::: the search continues :::<br/>
