                    <div class="plaintext-content">This mail is being sent as part of an ongoing game of Twenty <br/>
Questions which has the purpose of determining the clues for the <br/>
Twenty Questions Letterbox.  For more details see:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br/>
boxnum=22779&amp;boxname=Twenty_Questions<br/>
<br/>
Before we get to the Question 6 and its answer, perhaps there needs <br/>
to be a gentle admonishment of some of the submitters.  In my opinion <br/>
Question 6 is a wasted question.  Given the rules I have defined for <br/>
this puzzle, I must randomly pick the question to answer and I must <br/>
answer it truthfully with a Yes or No.  The only way I could have <br/>
answered Question 6 with a Yes is if the box lay somewhere on the <br/>
physical trail.  If it was (or is) even a few feet off the trail I <br/>
would have have to answer No.  Please be careful what you ask and how <br/>
you ask it.  It may make the difference between the box eventually <br/>
being found and it laying hidden forever.<br/>
<br/>
That's it.  No more advice.  14 questions remain.<br/>
<br/>
Questions answered so far:<br/>
<br/>
Question 1: Is it East of 87 degrees West (This is a longitude line <br/>
just East of Chicago)?<br/>
Answer 1:  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Question 2:  Is it South of the Mason Dixon Line (Pennsylvania - <br/>
Maryland border)?<br/>
Answer 2:  No.<br/>
<br/>
Question 3:  Is the box located in New England (Maine, New Hampshire, <br/>
Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut)?<br/>
Answer 3:  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Question 4:  Is the letterbox located in Southern New England <br/>
(Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut)?<br/>
Answer 4:  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Question 5:  Does the state where the box is located share a border <br/>
with New York?<br/>
Answer 5:  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Question 6:  Is it on the Appalachian trail?<br/>
Answer 6:  No.<br/>
<br/>
Now accepting candidates for Question 7.  Fire away. Please send your <br/>
questions as described in the original instructions.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
The Ephemeral Letterboxer<br/>

However, I would please ask you to be gentler in your language about<br/>
your fellow letterboxers.  It is great that you are enthusiastic (it's<br/>
fun &amp; I've been following along too), but please don't let that<br/>
enthusiasm lead you to belittle others.  I think that's against the<br/>
spirit of the amusing game that Ephemeral Letterboxer is orchestrating.<br/>

Are you assuming it is in CT?  Or do you have two flat rocks in your <br/>
back yard under which the White PZ Cut was stashed and now maybe a 20Q <br/>
Box??  It was apparently planted while you were in OR, suggest you go <br/>
out and look.<br/>
<br/>
This ephemeralletterboxer is a cagy one.  South of Hartford CT 41n46 <br/>
equates to South of Taunton MA 41n54 and the answer could be YES and <br/>
where does that take us?  CT or MA???  <br/>
<br/>
I think that was latitude I quoted from  http://www.astro.com/atlas/<br/>
but you get the idea.<br/>

criticize the question that was asked.  Everyone is allowed an <br/>
opinion and people need to learn to agree to disagree if such a case <br/>
arises.  Obviously people disagree with what I said, however I stand <br/>
by my opinion regardless whether people viewed it as harsh or mean.  <br/>
I am not the horrible person people are making me out to be, I made <br/>

As you said, you are certainly entitled to have your opinion, but you are<br/>
not entitled to run roughshod over others in the interest of expressing your<br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Dewberry and others - please play this game kindly.  It was<br/>
put forth with a spirit of fun and sportsmanship.   For those of us who are<br/>
out of range of the box, we are enjoying watching from the sidelines and are<br/>
envious of those of you who are playing with the hopes of going for the<br/>
gusto.  It sure takes the fun out of it for everyone, including us on the<br/>
sidelines, when someone can't play nicely.<br/>

is <br/>

we <br/>

  I don't see what the big deal is. Did someone spill your milk or something? yes everyone has there freedom of speech, but come on guy. If I remember correctly, there are 14 more questions. Don't ruin such a wonderful concept. I have had my issues here in the past. This is something stupid to get upset about. How about letting it go.<br/>
<br/>
  My question is - "Is it in a box?" no wait - "If the box happens to get wet, is the box water proof?" oh, I got it. - "Do I need my own ink pad?"<br/>
  please concider........<br/>
<br/>
  I do realize that I too, have freedom of speech. One of the special freedoms I have in the "Live Free or Die" state. But I guess you don't have to live in my neck of the woods to open your trap. Oh man, I've said to much already.<br/>

This is a great game the The Ephemeral Letterboxer has put together. I do<br/>
have one concern.<br/>
<br/>
With the heightened anticipation with each passing clue, that once the<br/>
location is finally disclosed, all the locals will want to be the "first<br/>
finders" and rush to the location. I know there is a Boo Boo Box, has anyone<br/>
created a Speeding Ticket Box?<br/>
