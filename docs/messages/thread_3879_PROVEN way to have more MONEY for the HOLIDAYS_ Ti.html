$$  GUARANTEED WAY TO QUICKLY HAVE EXCELLENT CREDIT!!  $$<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Friend,<br/>
<br/>
Give yourself the ADVANTAGE of enjoying life more with EXCELLENT<br/>
CREDIT!! Over the past 8 years I have perfected a system called<br/>
the Proven Credit Advantage Program. It's a guaranteed way for<br/>
legally getting an excellent credit rating almost instantly. <br/>
Here's how:<br/>
<br/>
If you have bad credit you will simply go through my easy 5 step<br/>
program to quickly get a new, legal, unblemished credit file and <br/>
establish Excellent Credit. If you don't have bad credit, but<br/>
want to make your existing credit EXCELLENT, we will go straight<br/>
to STEP 5.<br/>
<br/>
Step 1 - <br/>
Because no two people in the United States have the same Social<br/>
Security Number, Banks and Creditors access your credit file <br/>
almost entirely by your SS#. You will not want to change your<br/>
Social Security Number because it is extremely difficult to do <br/>
so and you need it for your Employment, Taxes and Social <br/>
Security Benefits. The FEDERAL PRIVACY ACT OF 1974 clearly<br/>
states that only the Government and your employer can force you <br/>
to use your SS#. Because of this law you are allowed to legally<br/>
use another 9 digit number to use in place of your Social<br/>
Security # on credit applications. <br/>
<br/>
The first day you become our client, you will receive your own<br/>
number through the Employer Identification Number Program. You<br/>
will need us for this because 95% of all Employer Identification<br/>
Numbers, although 9 digits, do not look anything like Social<br/>
Security Numbers and cannot be used on credit applications.<br/>
We will legally get you an Employer Identification Number that <br/>
fits in the same range of Social Numbers in use today. Because <br/>
the Federal Laws do not require you to give your SS# to anyone<br/>
besides your Employer and the Government, you can now legally <br/>
use this number in place of your SS# on credit applications. <br/>
Remember, your new number will only be used for new credit. <br/>
<br/>
Step 2 - <br/>
No two people with the same name have the same mailing address,<br/>
so you will need to obtain a new mailing address for use on your<br/>
new credit file. A friend, relative or mailbox address in your<br/>
area will be perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Step 3 - <br/>
No two people with the same name have the same telephone numbers, <br/>
so you will also need a new telephone number for use on your<br/>
new credit file. A friend, relative, voice mail or pager will <br/>
again work perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
Step 4 - <br/>
With your new Social Security number, new address and new<br/>
telephone number we will open your new credit file. It will now <br/>
be totally impossible for any creditor to know anything about<br/>
your past credit history.<br/>
<br/>
Step 5-<br/>
To guarantee that you will quickly have EXCELLENT CREDIT, we<br/>
will assist you in instantly adding UNLIMITED positive<br/>
information to your credit file. This is an unknown way of <br/>
adding real accounts to your new credit file to give you an <br/>
Excellent Credit Rating in less than 15 days. As you know, the <br/>
more positive information on your credit file, the more money <br/>
banks will lend you. Countless clients of ours have credit lines<br/>
over $100,000 because of our Proven Credit Advantage Program!<br/>
<br/>
When we are finished you will receive a copy of your credit<br/>
file proving that you now have excellent credit! This will take<br/>
less than 15 days. You will now be able to easily qualify for<br/>
ANY credit you apply for! To be on the road to EXCELLENT CREDIT<br/>
simply send us your name, complete mailing address including <br/>
zip code and telephone number (optional), along with a check<br/>
or money order payable to American Financial Services Inc. <br/>
for $29.95. <br/>
