Oh, and Jeremy/Greta, I also put the link to Blue Hills up. Can't <br/>
wait to check it out: I've got a conference in Boston at the end of <br/>
the month. I bought a Boston-area trail guide at a bargin basement <br/>
bookstore and had been planning to plant a Blue Hills letterbox <br/>
myself that weekend: looks like there's room for a BUNCH of boxes <br/>
there.<br/>

Hartford to find them. You can also find them by clicking on "New" at <br/>
