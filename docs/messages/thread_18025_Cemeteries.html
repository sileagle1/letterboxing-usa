Can I open a topic for input on a potential new "Rule?"<br/>
<br/>
One of the recent complaints from property owners about inappropriate <br/>
letterboxes came from the pastor of a congregation who discovered a letterbox clue on <br/>
the website that was placed in his church cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
Now we've planted cemetery boxes ourselves, even quite recently, and we are <br/>
frequent cemetery volunteers (check out www.raogk.org for more info), so we <br/>
understand the allure of hiding boxes there. They're scenic, full of history, <br/>
have good potential hiding places, open to the public, and the neighbors are <br/>
quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I can also understand the pastor's dilemma: they are often private property <br/>
and great respect must be shown for the people who use them and for the <br/>
religious aspects. A more letterboxing-specific pitfall comes to mind as well; those <br/>
busy grounds keepers.<br/>
<br/>
When there were just a few boxes here and there, an occasional cemetery <br/>
letterbox didn't seem to offer potential problems. I find 17 boxes at LbNA with <br/>
"cemetery" in the name, and I'm sure there are more. Now that the growth of <br/>
letterboxes is exploding (and we have almost doubled our numbers since the new site <br/>
went online a year ago), perhaps cemeteries should be off limits?<br/>
<br/>
What does the community think?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think there is a compromise here. As long as we remain respectful while planting in cemeteries, what harm is done? The search for the box could take you through the cemetery but the actual box could be planted on the outside fringes of the property. These cemeteries not only have wonderful history but, in some small way, I think the planting of letterboxes in cemeteries brings an awareness and a newfound appreciation for our past. As long as we don't overplant or abuse the situation, I say continue - tempered with respect.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have placed a letterbox at the National Cemetery in Florence, SC.  I feel no boxes should be placed anywhere especially cemeteries without PERMISSION from someone.  I know the red-tape that I went through to place this letterbox.  Permission came from Washington, DC and as a matter of fact they were very intrigued by the idea because so many of our National Cemeteries receive very, very few visitors.  There is so much history there and we should be honored to have placed like that to pay tribute to the men &amp; women who gave us our freedom that we take forgranted.  Patriotism has fallen by the wayside and if nothing else, I hope my letterbox will help promote patriotism.  Remember:  HISTORY THAT IS FORGOTTEN TENDS TO REPEAT ITSELF.<br/>
<br/>
My box is hidden in a place where none of the grave sites will be distrubed as well as, the clues do not lead you through the middle of the cemetery.  I was very careful to make sure that all respect is given for our fallen heros.  Please view my clues.<br/>

I still feel that no box should be placed anywhere without permission.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think letterboxing in cemeteries should occur with the utmost <br/>
respect and concern for survivors of its 'permanent residents' as <br/>
possible.  I can't even imagine personally placing a box in a <br/>
cemetery that is still open for 'new members.'  The thought of <br/>
participating in a 'fun' hobby in such a solemn locale personally <br/>
doesn't pass the 'gut test' with me.  It just doesn't feel right and <br/>
invokes a certain queasiness just thinking about it.  That's usually <br/>
what guides me when I decide to hide a letterbox someplace (in the <br/>
event there aren't already other rules prohibiting the activity in a <br/>
locale).  <br/>
<br/>
However, I have found a couple of letterboxes in cemeteries and <br/>
thoroughly enjoyed the hunt--BUT these were in HISTORICAL &amp; PIONEER <br/>
cemeteries that certainly were no longer receiving new 'residents'.  <br/>
It was obvious that very few, if any, folks were even visiting these <br/>
cemeteries and there were even LARGE historical markers encouraging <br/>
folks (tourists?) to learn more about the permanent residents <br/>
contained on its premises scattered all about the cemetery.  In that <br/>
situation, as long as the placer respects the premises, makes an <br/>
exceptional effort at hiding the container as discreetly and far <br/>
away from 'personal plots' as possible, then it seems to sit well <br/>
with my 'gut test'.  I would just encourage folks to use the 'what <br/>
if my relatives were buried here--would I still think this was <br/>
appropriate?' test when they consider placing a box in a cemetery <br/>
type venue.<br/>
<br/>
This topic sort of hits home with us, too, as we recently buried a <br/>
loved one (about a month ago).  Even in mourning I think we can <br/>
still come up with a respectful and appropriate 'guideline' <br/>
regarding letterboxing in cemeteries that encourages placers to <br/>
consider the feelings of the loved ones/survivors when deciding <br/>
whether to place a letterbox on the premises.<br/>
<br/>
Oh--an idea that might remedy this is to offset a letterbox!  <br/>
Encourage the finder to find some information contained on a plaque <br/>
or something on the premise (provided it's open to the public) that <br/>
helps them solve the clue and then physically hide the letterbox <br/>
somewhere else.  It works quite well for locales that don't support <br/>
these hobbies but still offer great venues for learning about <br/>
history, hiking, wildlife viewing, etc.    <br/>
<br/>
I'm curious to see how others feel about this subject, too.  <br/>

<br/>
"Off limits" sounds too strong for me.  I'd say, "strongly recommended" that you either get permission (from a cemetery that is still actively used or is on private property) or keep the box out of the cemetery proper, and show the utmost concern and care whether or not it's active or historical.  Many boxes around here with "cemetery" in the clue do not require the finder to be disrespectful of the gravesites, or even walk around a lot leaving a path. Often the boxes are in a stone wall, or better still, behind or outside of the cemetery, such as behind the stone wall in a small rock cairn.  Just my 2 cents.<br/>

done properly and with respect.<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, ask permission from the owner or manager.  e.g. <br/>
Is there a house of worship next to it?  Is there a management <br/>
office on the grounds?  Is there a cemetary department at the local <br/>
municipal offices?  In some cases there may not be anyone managing <br/>
it, but try to find out first.<br/>
<br/>
Second, be respectful of the departed.  Write the clues to honor the <br/>
historic signifigance of the cemetary.  Honor the accomplishments of <br/>
the residents.  Ask yourself, "What if my reletives were interred <br/>
here, would I object to what is written?"<br/>
<br/>
Third, be respectiful of the visitors who come to pay their <br/>
respects.  In some cases the cemetary may set aside hours for <br/>
recreational visitors, and hours for funerals and mourning.  Put <br/>
these in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
All in all the planting of boxes in cemetaries can connect us to the <br/>
past and those who have gone before.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One must also remember that many "old" [family, pioneer &amp; <br/>
Historical] cemeteries may be owned by a family member. My family <br/>
owns two "family cemeteries" in Southeast Missouri and legally we <br/>
can still be buried in them. We own the deeds to the property and it <br/>
has been in our family for over 156 years. Just because a cemetery <br/>
is old doesn't mean that people may no longer be being buried <br/>
there.By law I'm entitled to be buried there when I die. <br/>
<br/>
Family cemeteries are not that common on the West Coast but I know <br/>
that in the older areas of the country that there are lots of them. <br/>
Especially throughout the Midwest/Southern area of the USA. In <br/>
Washington State we have many "public" pioneer cemeteries but not <br/>
very many family ones. That may be due to the fact that we didn't <br/>
have large family farms that people inheirited for generations.<br/>
<br/>
I was recently visiting our family cemeteries and thought about <br/>
planting a letterbox there but realized that it could negatively <br/>
impact the area if "non-letterboxers" found the clues. One of our <br/>
cemeteries is located 2 miles down a dirt/gravel road near St. James <br/>
Missouri.The caretaker lives kitty-corner from it and is frequently <br/>
has to chase highschool students out during the summertime. <br/>
<br/>
Many small "family/historical" cemeteries are constantly facing <br/>
problems with people thinking that they are abandoned and "public <br/>
domain". By no means am I saying that people shouldn't place <br/>
letterboxes in/around cemeteries. Like others have expressed be <br/>
considerate of the surroundings, the enviroment and people who may <br/>
be visiting it. I would also ask the owners/caretaker just as I <br/>
would if I wanted to place a letterbox in a place of business. <br/>
<br/>
And if I was to decide to hunt down a box placed in a cemetery I <br/>
would do it with the utmost respect for the residents and visitors <br/>
there.<br/>

&gt;religious aspects. A more letterboxing-specific pitfall comes to mind as <br/>
&gt;well; those<br/>
&gt;busy grounds keepers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When there were just a few boxes here and there, an occasional cemetery<br/>
&gt;letterbox didn't seem to offer potential problems. I find 17 boxes at LbNA <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;"cemetery" in the name, and I'm sure there are more. Now that the growth of<br/>
&gt;letterboxes is exploding (and we have almost doubled our numbers since the <br/>
&gt;new site<br/>
&gt;went online a year ago), perhaps cemeteries should be off limits?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What does the community think?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we bury a loved one we do it with honor and respect.  The place <br/>
becomes honorary and respectable in the process.  Any letterbox <br/>
placed in such an honored place must be placed with just such <br/>
respect.  Still, the body is just a shell and any respect that is <br/>
paid to the body or the place is in the mind and heart of the <br/>
visitor.  The person in the ground does not care any longer as they <br/>
have vacated the shell and their mind and spirit no longer dwell <br/>
there. Still, again, the deceased's loved ones may still hold the <br/>
place in such honor that an intrusion on that place may be taken as <br/>
disrespectful.  Here is where discretion is needed-both on the part <br/>
of the box placer and on the part of the searcher to treat the place <br/>
with the respect it is due and not go trampling willy nilly all over <br/>
the place. There is a respectful way to do this which both honors <br/>
those who are gone, those who love them, and also allows reasonable <br/>
access for the boxer.  <br/>
<br/>
I have placed at a letterbox in a cemetery.  It is a very peaceful, <br/>
beautiful and important historical place.  It is also the resting <br/>
place of several of my ancestors, most recently my paternal <br/>
grandmother who we buried there only 4 months ago.  It would be my <br/>
wish that people who search for my letterbox there do so with all the <br/>
respect deserved to a loved one, a war hero, and a forefather (all of <br/>
which are represented in the cemetery). It is also my desire that <br/>
people do actualy go there, I encourage as many people as possible to <br/>
visit the site as I feel that it does give respect to those who are <br/>
now gone. It also reminds us of just how temporary our life is in <br/>
view of the eternal.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe that the vast majority of people who will visit this box <br/>
will benefit from the peacefullness and beauty of this place as well <br/>
as the exposure to the idea of death as it relates to our temporary <br/>
life.  When was the last time that you were at a cemetery? Was is a <br/>
positive experience?  Even though sometimes painful, visiting a <br/>
cemetery connects people to the idea of a temporary life and <br/>
encourages them to take a look at their own life and re-examine their <br/>
priorities and that is healthy.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I encourage those interested in placing boxes in cemeteries to <br/>
do so with the utmost respect but to yes, do place boxes in <br/>
cemeteries.  I also encourage letterboxers to seek them there but <br/>
with respect. Not the same respect that would not want to be given to <br/>
you if you were buried there, but with the same respect that you <br/>
would think the most sensitive person you could imagine's loved ones <br/>
were buried there.  And if you do not feel that it is appropriate to <br/>
letterbox in a cemetery, then dont.  But please respect those of us <br/>
who do and honor those who we honor with our boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">    I exactly agree.  Part of the place that cemeteries have in our society is a memorial.  I was very touched when looking for a particular letterbox in RI to go to a marker for a WWI veteran of my old Army unit, the 103rd Field Artillery!  Cemeteries and graveyards, approached with respect, are a wonderful place to even take school children, to answer their questions about the past (Not just a stale history book, but a collection of people trying to make ends meet!).  Letterbox clues can point out something that otherwise may go ignored in the bustle of life.  There's a very old grave on Jamestown, RI, marked only by a pattern of small rocks in the ground that says "MOTHER".  She should be visited by someone.<br/>
    Another, deeper part, though, is that graveyards and cemeteries are where people go to mourn.  Utmost care must be taken to preserve the sacred atmosphere.  Fortunately, I believe that letterboxers are a very thoughtful bunch, and I appreciate how much you've all approached this topic.<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Re: Cemeteries<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I think letterboxing in cemeteries should occur with the utmost <br/>
  respect and concern for survivors of its 'permanent residents' as <br/>
  possible.  I can't even imagine personally placing a box in a <br/>
  cemetery that is still open for 'new members.'  The thought of <br/>
  participating in a 'fun' hobby in such a solemn locale personally <br/>
  doesn't pass the 'gut test' with me.  It just doesn't feel right and <br/>
  invokes a certain queasiness just thinking about it.  That's usually <br/>
  what guides me when I decide to hide a letterbox someplace (in the <br/>
  event there aren't already other rules prohibiting the activity in a <br/>
  locale).  <br/>
<br/>
  However, I have found a couple of letterboxes in cemeteries and <br/>
  thoroughly enjoyed the hunt--BUT these were in HISTORICAL &amp; PIONEER <br/>
  cemeteries that certainly were no longer receiving new 'residents'.  <br/>
  It was obvious that very few, if any, folks were even visiting these <br/>
  cemeteries and there were even LARGE historical markers encouraging <br/>
  folks (tourists?) to learn more about the permanent residents <br/>
  contained on its premises scattered all about the cemetery.  In that <br/>
  situation, as long as the placer respects the premises, makes an <br/>
  exceptional effort at hiding the container as discreetly and far <br/>
  away from 'personal plots' as possible, then it seems to sit well <br/>
  with my 'gut test'.  I would just encourage folks to use the 'what <br/>
  if my relatives were buried here--would I still think this was <br/>
  appropriate?' test when they consider placing a box in a cemetery <br/>
  type venue.<br/>
<br/>
  This topic sort of hits home with us, too, as we recently buried a <br/>
  loved one (about a month ago).  Even in mourning I think we can <br/>
  still come up with a respectful and appropriate 'guideline' <br/>
  regarding letterboxing in cemeteries that encourages placers to <br/>
  consider the feelings of the loved ones/survivors when deciding <br/>
  whether to place a letterbox on the premises.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh--an idea that might remedy this is to offset a letterbox!  <br/>
  Encourage the finder to find some information contained on a plaque <br/>
  or something on the premise (provided it's open to the public) that <br/>
  helps them solve the clue and then physically hide the letterbox <br/>
  somewhere else.  It works quite well for locales that don't support <br/>
  these hobbies but still offer great venues for learning about <br/>
  history, hiking, wildlife viewing, etc.    <br/>
<br/>
  I'm curious to see how others feel about this subject, too.  <br/>
