I should have such problems!  Take a look sometime at how few boxes <br/>
there are in the St. Louis, Missouri area.  At this point, I'll go on <br/>
drive-bys, short hikes, long hikes - whatever it takes to scratch this <br/>
letterboxing itch!  :-D  If there were one nearby, I'd try to get it, <br/>
no matter how long the hike. (Ok, I probably wouldn't hike and camp, <br/>
cause I don't have the equipment.  Yet.)<br/>
<br/>
b/t/w - on vacation last week in north Delaware, I got 29 boxes, <br/>
including a few hitchhikers, plus a couple of personal exchanges. And <br/>
helped my friend find a spot to plant a new box.<br/>
<br/>
For the most part, we chose to search in parks with multiple boxes <br/>
plus a drive-by, to maximize my time during the visit.  I saw loads of <br/>
pretty, pretty places and learned things I didn't know about local <br/>
history - despite having lived the first 33 years of my life there!  I <br/>
think even tho none of the hikes (individually) were more than 4 or 5 <br/>
miles, they were all a blast.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as an "urban" letterboxer, my plants to date have been on gentle <br/>
strolls through city parkland - I hope this doesn't keep anyone away!<br/>
<br/>
Ok, back to finish reading the list - I hope y'all had a great <br/>
weekend!  I sure did!<br/>

P.S.  I visited a couple of days in Dallas on the way home and got two <br/>
more finds in the Cedar Ridge Nature preserve...dragging my <br/>
unsuspecting friends out in 100 degree heat.  Someone help me...I <br/>
think I'm addicted...<br/>
