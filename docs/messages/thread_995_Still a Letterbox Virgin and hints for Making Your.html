or<br/>
"Soft-Kut Printing Blocks"<br/>
They hold a fine line, pick up ink well<br/>

I do all my professional block-print<br/>

CT, we have a small stand with three binders full of clues and three <br/>
art-boards of stamps so that people can "register" their stamps. I myself am <br/>
about to get rid of a lot of old tupperware! So, hey, chin up and it'll <br/>

I guess I must have been relatively lucky or Walmart tupperware type<br/>
containers are of exceptional quality. My boxes on the east coast of<br/>
Florida have gone through numerous storms and two brushes with hurricanes<br/>
and have suffered _no_ leakage that I can tell. Go figure ;-)<br/>

Well, Rubbermaid still is my favorite - out a couple of years, subjected<br/>
to flooding, still watertight (mostly)<br/>
