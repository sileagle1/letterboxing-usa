                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is anybody going letterboxing tomorrow (Sunday)?  I live in Eastern <br/>
Connecticut, and will be going out tomorrow to look for two or three <br/>
boxes.  The forecast for our area right now is anywhere from a foot <br/>
to over two feet of snow, beginning late Sunday night/early Monday <br/>
morning, and not stopping until sometime on Tuesday.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm mulling making a hitchhiker to mark the occasion, maybe calling <br/>
it the Blizzard of 2001 letterbox, or something like that.  When I <br/>
found a hitchhiker it was a tube, and had a stack of stapled paper in <br/>
lieu of a real log book.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this standard, or are there pretty much 'no rules' for <br/>
hitchhikers?  I suppose the container should have as small of a <br/>
profile as possible, so it can be hidden with existing letterboxes <br/>
without having to do too much extra work (digging, finding extra <br/>
rocks, etc.), but other than that, what's the custom?<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'll be picking up some firewood tomorrow after I finish my <br/>
hiking!  On the upside, I may get to stay home from work on Monday <br/>
and/or Tuesday -- during the last big storm parts of the state got 19 <br/>
or 20 inches of snow, and we got sent home from work around noon or 1 <br/>
pm.  I love snow when I don't have to worry about driving in it!  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck to all of you in the path of this monster!<br/>

Absolutely, we wouldn't miss a snow free day like this!  Especially if we<br/>
may not be<br/>
able to go for  a while.<br/>

<br/>
A new hitchhiker :)  Hmm- now where did you say you'd be hiking??? :)<br/>
You can put whatever kind of log book you want.  Some are little notebooks,<br/>
some, like you said, are just some paper stapled together.  I think it's<br/>
whatever you want.  Some hitchhikers don't even have there own container.<br/>
The logbook and stamp travel from box to box in a zip-lock baggie.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;and/or Tuesday -- during the last big storm parts of the state got 19<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too! I am lucky to work in a school.  A little snow and we are the first<br/>
to close!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your hitch hiker.  Would love to find it drifting around.<br/>

  Stayed home from work due to the weather forecast for this afternoon..I've <br/>
heard 10&gt;24"..I'm sure my boss is looking out his window over in New jersey <br/>
and questioning my calling out..OH! the guilt of it all..<lol><br/>
  Any way I am concerned for my 1st box plant this weekend! I've seen and <br/>
heard that Gladware doesn't seem to hold up to the winter weather very well <br/>
so I used the heavy Dollar Store tuperware type box. I also used Ziploc <br/>
Double Guard freezer bags for the log book and such.The bags are supposed to <br/>
protect against freezer burn so I thought maybe it would protect against <br/>
"wild" weather too.As a concerned box "parent" now I think that perhaps I <br/>
should have doubled or as you sugested tripled the zip lock protection...as <br/>
you can guess, my 10yr old son is always well protected when he goes out to <br/>
play in the snow!!<lol><br/>
  Hope you all have a great snow day and enjoy the "Blizzard" : )<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking of hitch hikers I have a few updates to make.  Dan and I found the<br/>
Blizzard of 2001 hitch hiker at the first Gay City box on Sunday, April 8th.<br/>
It has not yet found a new home.  Our traveller, Stellaluna was found by an<br/>
anonomous writer and daughter on February 17th at Milo Light in Montville.<br/>
Palantir has had a busy journey.  After the Wiz found Palantir he took it on<br/>
many adventures in RI before leaving it at Beavertail Light in Jamestown RI.<br/>
A couple weeks later Wanda and Pete found it and it visited many boxes in CT<br/>
and RI.  Palantir also met the Groundhog and Mercy Brown hitch hikers- the<br/>
lucky little traveller!  On March 11 we met up with Wanda and Pete at the<br/>
EMS Lantern Hill hike.  We traded them the Ready Freddy hitch hiker (which<br/>
we found at the Ashford Oak on March 4) for Palantir. Now it is probably in<br/>
the hands of the elements.  We left it at Fowler-Grindstone in the third box<br/>
and met Annie &amp; Evelyn on our way out.<br/>
 Well I think that just about covers it.  If any one out there has caught<br/>
the Moose on the Loose we would love to know where it has been!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Melissa &amp; Dan<br/>

&gt;&gt; I just checked the current hitchhiker list at<br/>
&gt;&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org, and this isn't listed&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry, Chris!!! Tom in VT is the hitch hiker guru, but he has had a<br/>
&gt;busy winter. I sort of poached on his territory and updated the hitch<br/>
&gt;hiker page: sorry I forgot yours. It's up there now.<br/>
