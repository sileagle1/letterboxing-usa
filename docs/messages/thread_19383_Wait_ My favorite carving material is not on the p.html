It is a quarter inch thick grey rubber that cuts like butter and and<br/>
stamps up really nice. The cost is another bonus for people like me<br/>
who carve lots of stamps.  A 12"X18" sheet is only $7.69 and yields 54<br/>
 2"X2" stamps which comes out to about 14 cents per stamp, not<br/>
including shipping and handling.<br/>
Sure I would love to use staedler Master Carve but that would really<br/>
limit not only how much I carve but also my fear of trying out<br/>
different things. One slip of the knife and I am out $2.00. My kids<br/>
also do lots of carving and I enjoy giving them the freedom to<br/>
experiment as they like.<br/>

Thanks Nisha for the recommendation. I just called the folks at Dick <br/>
Blick and they are shipping me some. Will compare and contrast it <br/>
with what I already use, MasterCarve. BTW, the price is $6.48 a sheet <br/>
12X18 and shipping for three sheets is about $7.00 more.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I am starting to plant a new series. Think I have misplaced <br/>
my logbook from before and may have to start over. Oh well.<br/>
<br/>
Be well and choose to be happy,<br/>
