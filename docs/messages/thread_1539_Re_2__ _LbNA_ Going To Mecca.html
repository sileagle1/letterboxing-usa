                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi ......... now Bill Reese and Eric Eutro both wrote about coming over to<br/>
Dartmoor...Hey the "moor the merrier" <big grin=""><br/>
<br/>
&gt;Hmmm, seems like there is definitely some interest out there in going to<br/>
&gt;Dartmoor! Well, I'm all for a group trip. Anything to save some simoleons!<br/>
&gt;I had considered doing a courier trip out there but i'm not sure how well<br/>
&gt;that would work out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Perhaps a trip to Hawaii as well? Maybe our next LBNA Gathering could be<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;HI?<br/>
<br/>
And as for the annual convention in Hawaii well ..wow what a pace to put<br/>
out boxes...I'll be there....pls do consider <g><br/>
<br/>
In Science Fiction fan circles (fandom), they have something called<br/>
'TAFF', the transatlantic fan fund, and sf fans vote for a pair of fans<br/>
from each side of the pond to visit the other ..and "donate" cash to vote<br/>
and so pay for the trips..seems a good idea to me..join my campaign team<br/>
now  !!<br/>
<grin><br/>
<br/>
I could certainly and definitely do Hawaii justice...Not just enjoying the<br/>
sunshine and beaches and good food and drink..no that's only of very<br/>
little interest ! &lt; very very big grin&gt;  Vote for me..hand counts only<br/>
please <chuckle>..er 'dimpled' counts too ! <grin><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I think the Dartmoor trip is an excellent idea.  Incidentally, I spoke<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
<br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;&gt; couple of friends of mine in London the other day, and they'd never<br/>
&gt;heard<br/>
<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  When I told them it originated in Dartmoor, they each<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; basically responded with "Oh, that explains it."  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;I'm not exactly sure<br/>
<br/>
&gt;what<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; that's supposed to mean.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Ho Ho <grin><br/>
<br/>
Well Dartmoor is a very wild place in UK terms !<br/>
<br/>
Very Hillbilly and Backwoodsie and well a little bit spooky too !<br/>
<br/>
..and...Letterboxing is still a "secret hobby" over here !<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; But back to the trip, I'm sure we could get a great rate if we were to<br/>
<br/>
&gt;plan<br/>
&gt;&gt; far enough in advance, and go as a group, therefore qualifying for a<br/>
&gt;&gt; discount.  It's something to toss around.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can even persuade an old Moorland Wizard into being a moorland<br/>
letterboxing guide too...<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing<br/>
