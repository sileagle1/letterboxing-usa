I have hidden a new letterbox in Atlanta, <br/>
GA.  The clue sheet for the box is located <br/>
on the following web page:<br/>
<br/>
www.mathcs.emory.edu/~dj/easteregg.html<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know this is the first letterbox in <br/>
Georgia.  This is also the first letterbox I <br/>
have hidden since I started hunting for them <br/>
last fall.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Easter, and Happy Hunting!<br/>

The URL for the Easter Egg Letterbox has <br/>
changed.  The clues may now be located <br/>
here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/djonas2000/<br/>
easteregg.html<br/>
<br/>
I was excited to see the LBNA map updated<br/>
to include GA and my link.  I want to make <br/>
sure the clues are still available...I do not <br/>
think anyone has found the box yet.  When <br/>
are you guys coming down sourth?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
 Please pass this along to whoever maintains<br/>
the LBNA page and US Map.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I hope to place the first Alabama box<br/>
this Fall...unless someone beats me to it.<br/>

     I don't think I was the first..... It was so dark on Tuesday evening<br/>
when I got to the box that I could barely see. (I should add a flashlight to<br/>
my LB kit) I think I saw a "Dave" stamp ahead of me....  I had a fantastic<br/>
walk through that beautiful park....  I NEED to become a University<br/>
president... What a house....  The box was is great shape.<br/>
