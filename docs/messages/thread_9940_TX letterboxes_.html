My knowledge of Texas geography won't help you much, but I *can* tell <br/>
you that Corpus Christi is one of the strangest holidays I've ever <br/>
witnessed, and I still can't tell you what it's about!<br/>

I just posted 4 more Texas Letterboxes and plan to place 5 more next <br/>
week.  I have started the Six Flags Of Texas Letterbox Series with <br/>
the U.S.A. Flag box in Austin (about 1 hour north of San Antonio) and <br/>
the Spanish Flag box in San Antonio.  The Come And Take box is in <br/>
Gonzales which is about 45 minutes east of San Antonio.  The Father <br/>
Of Texas box is part of my Texas Birding Trail Series but is closer <br/>
to Houston so probably too far for your trip.<br/>
My next five will include:  the Mexico Flag in Goliad, which is about <br/>
1 hour southeast of San Antonio, the Mustang Dolphin on Mustang <br/>
Island, which is just a few minutes south of Corpus Christi, the Big <br/>
Tree in Goose Island State Park, which is about 30 minutes northeast <br/>
of Corpus Christi, the Aransas Whooper in Aransas NWR, which is about <br/>
45 minutes northeast of Corpus Christi, and the French Flag in <br/>
Indianola, which is about 1 hour northeast of Corpus Christi.  You <br/>
could drive north from San Antonio to Austin and find my box plus <br/>
several others hidden there.  Then back to San Antonio and drive east <br/>
on I10 to Hwy 183.  Go south to Gonzales and eventually Goliad (Baby <br/>
Bear also has a box here).  Then go east on Hwy 59 to Victoria then <br/>
south on Hwy 87 to Indianola.  Then go southwest on Hwy 35 to Aransas <br/>
NWR then to Goose Island State Park.  Continue on Hwy 35 to Aransas <br/>
Pass and take the free ferry to Mustang Island.<br/>
Baby Bear and I just started letterboxing so we are stamping as fast <br/>
as we can.  Some of our posts don't make it to the clues section <br/>
right away so check the talklist for the latest.  Hope this helps.<br/>

make it to Mustang Island so exclude that one from my suggested <br/>
itinerary below.  Definitely go to Aransas NWR.  I saw 2 whooping <br/>
cranes from the Observation Tower, javelinas and turkeys by the road <br/>
and scores of other birds.  I also took a whooping crane boat tour <br/>
from Rockport and highly recommend it.  I saw over 20 whooping <br/>
cranes, some fairly close, and even a coyote!  Of the other birds I <br/>
saw the most special was a peregrin falcon.  Winter in Texas is great!<br/>
