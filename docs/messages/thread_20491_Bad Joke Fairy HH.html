work anymore, so I am hoping the creator sees this post! Many of the<br/>
entries in the book do not have dates on them so I can't really tell<br/>
you when and where it has been! But I can tell you that I found it on<br/>
8/28/04 in Boothbay at the Mr. and Mrs. Potatohead series box of eyes!<br/>
I couldn't tell you where and when it was placed and found in other<br/>
places as the most previous date listed was 12/8/02.<br/>
<br/>
I will re-place soon.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this finds you!<br/>
