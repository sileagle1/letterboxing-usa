&gt;  Believe it or not, the election is over! <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Gov. George Bush has won.  Not only that but he has won the region <br/>
in a land <br/>
&gt; slide.  Just look at these county by county results:   <a <br="">
&gt; HREF="http://www.usatoday.com/news/vote2000/cbc/map.htm"&gt;County-by-<br/>
county</a> <br/>
&gt;    Did you see the little blue areas?  Those were the only counties <br/>
that Gore <br/>
&gt; carried ... they were, however, very densely populated counties.  <br/>
That was <br/>
&gt; one reason our very wise founding fathers deliberately set up the <br/>
electoral <br/>
&gt; college...so that New York did not elect the president of our <br/>
Nation every <br/>
&gt; four years.  Of course, some people (like Hillary Clinton as she <br/>
has clearly <br/>
&gt; stated) would like nothing better than to eliminate the electoral <br/>
college and <br/>
&gt; allow that very thing.  Back to the point....after the Florida <br/>
Supreme Court <br/>
&gt; mandated 12 additional days of vote search or ballot counting to <br/>
allow the <br/>
&gt; partisan politicians to find more votes for their candidate, then <br/>
the Florida <br/>
&gt; Secretary of State was required by Florida law to certify the <br/>
election <br/>
&gt; results and the Governor of Florida was require to send <br/>
ascertainment of this <br/>
&gt; certification and the names of the appointed members of the <br/>
Electoral college <br/>
&gt; to the US Capital.  Once done ... the Florida Victor became Gov. <br/>
George Bush <br/>
&gt; (since the democrats were unable to dredge up enough Gore votes).  <br/>
It is a <br/>
&gt; fact of law.  As far as Florida is concerned  Gov. George Bush is <br/>
now <br/>
&gt; President-Elect George Bush.  See for yourself:    <a <br="">

&gt;   If you knew all this you might say, "So What? What can I do?" <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  This is what you can do: You can let Gore know that you know he <br/>
has <br/>
&gt; lost....send your own or the attached open letter to Gore then <br/>
forward it to <br/>
&gt; all members of the press and all the members of the Senate and <br/>
House whose <br/>
&gt; addresses you can find...especially to the Democrats.   Then pass <br/>
this email <br/>
&gt; request on to everyone you can.<br/>

&gt;    An Open Letter to<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;     Mr Vice President Gore,  <br/>
&gt;    It is way past time for you to concede.  <br/>
&gt;    According to the Florida Supreme Court you were given twelve <br/>
additional <br/>
&gt; days to come up with more votes.  After twelve days the recounts <br/>
still showed <br/>
&gt; Gov. George Bush as the victor.  As directed by the Supreme Court, <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Secretary of State of Florida certified the election results then, <br/>
by law, <br/>
&gt; the Governor of Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush, was required to submit the <br/>
names of <br/>
&gt; the electors in a certificate of ascertainment to the US capital.   <br/>
<a <br="">

&gt; College-2000 Certificates of ASCERTAINMENT</a> <br/>
&gt;    Once done, then Gov. George Bush became the official victor in <br/>
Florida.  <br/>
&gt; The election is over, please concede.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Sincerely, <br/>
&gt;     &gt;&gt; BBB<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  BY THE WAY:  The so-called absentee ballot forgery claims are <br/>
total <br/>
&gt; fabrications.  A registrar of the state has the legal right to help <br/>
prepare <br/>
&gt; the absentee ballot requests forms for individuals who are <br/>
requesting these <br/>
&gt; forms.  This is what was done because the request forms were <br/>
prepared by the <br/>
&gt; republican registrars and a space to fill out required information <br/>
was left <br/>
&gt; off the form. The registrars came into the office to fill in this <br/>
information <br/>
&gt; on all the request forms which were received.  This is perfectly <br/>
legal and <br/>
&gt; followed the requirements and guidelines intended to aid <br/>
&gt;  every registered American in the voting process. The allegations <br/>
that only <br/>
&gt; republicans were allowed to do this has no grounds in truth.<br/>
