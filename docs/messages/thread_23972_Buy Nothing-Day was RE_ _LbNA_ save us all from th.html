                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Mosey for responding in a most thoughtful, logical and succinct<br/>
manner.  I know the weather is getting colder, folks, but it is far too<br/>
early to begin the season of online nastiness.  I try to see the wisdom in<br/>
the response of every poster, but sometimes that is difficult for me.  I<br/>
hope that everyone remembers there are real persons connected to the tips<br/>
of all these fingers that tap away.  On Buy-Nothing Day (this Friday), I<br/>
challenge everyone to stay offline (so get those clues printed before<br/>
Thursday) and go outside for some fresh air and some letterboxes.<br/>
