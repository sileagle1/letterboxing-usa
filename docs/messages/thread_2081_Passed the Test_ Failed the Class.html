Stamper was kind enough to put out 3 new boxes at Rock Creek campus at<br/>
Portland Community College.<br/>
<br/>
With a little daylight and the right coordinates, John and I were<br/>
delighted to go straight to boxes 2 and 3 out there.  BUT...when it was<br/>
time to snag #1, no dice.  Not only that, but we came across Wayne of<br/>
Team Recon wandering around seeking same said box.  Hours later we were<br/>
all unsuccessful and by then it was getting too late to go after the<br/>
"easy" Rock Creek series just down the road by Bethany Lake (Wayne's<br/>
already got that set, anyway, I think)<br/>
<br/>
Der Mad Stamper is swearing by his Box #1 clues, but Wayne is really<br/>
good at this and we're all confused.  I know the base of every tree in<br/>
that wilderness sanctuary like they are my best buddies, now, it feels<br/>
like, but none of them seem to be harboring the elusive PCC Rock Creek<br/>
letterbox #1, at least not as far as we can tell.  <br/>
<br/>
Hey Der Mad Stumper, how about an additional clue or two to help us out.<br/>
My truck is tired of heading out to Rock Creek wasting its gas, so<br/>
unless you toss us a bone, I think I'll steer cleer of the West side for<br/>
a while.<br/>
<br/>
Also...Moorland Wizard are you still out there?  You've been so quiet<br/>
and we feel your pain that Dartmoor is off limits and you cannot<br/>
letterbox where you live.<br/>
<br/>
Best Regards,<br/>
