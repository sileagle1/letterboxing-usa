in Danbury!  I was thrilled !!  Will be happy to move it along!  All three <br/>
boxes at Bear Mt are in good shape.  There is no longer a stump at box 2, <br/>
however.<br/>
<br/>
I then headed to Putnam Memorial State Park in Redding where I found all <br/>
three boxes.  The first box is in poor shape - if I return to that area next <br/>
weekend I will replace it.<br/>
<br/>
Next I tackled the Three Boxes in the Danbury Area with no problem.  These <br/>
had eluded me in the past so I was really happy to find these.<br/>
<br/>
I ended my day finding the four boxes at Tarrywile Park in Danbury.  The <br/>
third box was quite the hike but enjoyable.  All boxes there are fine as <br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
Thirteen boxes in total today plus the HH - I'm really liking this <br/>
letterboxing!<br/>

Wonderful! We'd been wondering how long Bunny would tolerate playing nice<br/>
with the Bears.<br/>

Thanks for the update,<br/>
