<br/>
There is nothing like walking out into the woods in your own backyard <br/>
to find a new letterbox!  <br/>
<br/>
We were first.  We used the "breathe on it" method to use your <br/>
original colors to stamp in our books.  We really enjoyed that.<br/>

&gt; This box is placed near the Harpers Square Explorers' "Christmas <br/>
Tree <br/>
&gt; Graveyard" box.  Please check out their clues first!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/va/xmasgrav.htm<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Before or after finding the Christmas Tree Graveyard box, go to the <br/>
creek <br/>
&gt; crossing.  On the southern bank of the creek, there is a manhole <br/>
cover.  <br/>
&gt; Standing on that manhole cover, take a bearing of 150 degrees.  <br/>
Follow the <br/>
&gt; trail for 41 footfalls.  On the right, see a large tree that has <br/>
broken in <br/>
&gt; half.  In the half that is still standing hides the little critter <br/>
you are <br/>
&gt; looking for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please recover this box very carefully as it is very visible from <br/>
the trail!<br/>
