<br/>
Ridley Creek Box<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Southeastern Pennsylvania, Delaware County, near Gradyville, PA, placed by<br/>
Arbo on 6/12/02<br/>
A 2-3 hour hike located in the outer Philly suburbs in beautiful Ridley<br/>
Creek State Park.<br/>
Getting there: From I-476 South, Take exit 3 (Rt.1 South). Turn right onto<br/>
PA 352 North. Pass by Granite Run Mall. At 4th stoplight turn right onto<br/>
Gradyville Rd. At stop sign turn right. Continue on that road past the park<br/>
office to picnic area #14. From there the games afoot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Blue is a color you should know, follow this trail Northeast bound you go.<br/>
<br/>
Through tunneled foliage lush and green, across hard pavement where cars<br/>
careen.<br/>
<br/>
Past a settler house old and crumbled, treasure you seek be not humbled.<br/>
<br/>
At the juncture with an end, go by a tree that once had been.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on down blue pathway, around many turns along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Up a hill with blue and yellow, your time is short with this cowardly<br/>
fellow.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on with Mr. Blue, the shiny loot calls to you.<br/>
<br/>
Cross a road man has built, pass a pole with blue-white hilt.<br/>
<br/>
Over the bridge across the stream, then up the hill a hikers dream.<br/>
<br/>
Up the hill first left then right, Mr. Blues here do not fright.<br/>
<br/>
At the top a green grass ocean, continue right around the commotion.<br/>
<br/>
Find the path the color of light, Not much farther, Mr. White knows right.<br/>
<br/>
Down the hill and to the arrow, continue on down the 360 degree narrow.<br/>
<br/>
Past the trees with carvings askew, soon Ridley Creek will come into view.<br/>
<br/>
At the bottom where rapids flow, with the current you will go.<br/>
<br/>
To the second fallen tree, a bridge Mother Nature built for free.<br/>
<br/>
Across this sidewalk you will go, to find a letterbox a secret to know.<br/>
<br/>
Here the path is hard to see, you will pick it up at One-ten degree.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on down the way, along the anglers pathway.<br/>
<br/>
Spy a bench on a boulder, continue along the waters shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
Three boulders you come to on a turn, turn right through the pathway your<br/>
feet do yearn.<br/>
<br/>
Watch the stream along the way, many rocks you might say.<br/>
<br/>
But youll find these rocks with two large trees, your compass will work<br/>
from one of these.<br/>
