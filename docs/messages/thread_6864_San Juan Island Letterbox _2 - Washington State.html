San Juan Island National Historical Park<br/>
San Juan Island, Washington State<br/>
Nearest town:  Roche Harbor/Friday Harbor<br/>
Date Placed:  August 3, 2002 by the Smileys<br/>
Trail:  Easy<br/>
<br/>
You can get to this park from the ferry dock at Friday Harbor on San Juan<br/>
transit shuttle, on scooter,  bicycle, or by car.  If you get there on the<br/>
transit shuttle be sure to verify your pick-up time with the driver - it's<br/>
too far to walk back to Friday Harbor if you have a ferry to catch.   This<br/>
is a great national park area with two trails:  one climbs 650 feet up to<br/>
the top of Young Hill and the very easy &amp; scenic Bell Point Trail, which is<br/>
where the letterbox is.<br/>
<br/>
After stopping in at the ranger/volunteer area and learning the history of<br/>
the Pig War of 1859,  wander out toward the cool Blockhouse.  Just wish we<br/>
could still climb up in it.  Anyway, the trailhead for the Bell Point Trail<br/>
is off to the right of the Blockhouse.<br/>
<br/>
The mostly level, easy trail follows the edge of Garrison Bay.  You'll<br/>
probably want to stop and enjoy watching the boat traffic in the sheltered<br/>
bay.<br/>
<br/>
After passing the dinghy dock, continue on toward Bell Point until you find<br/>
a trail that splits off at 270 degrees.  The trail you are looking for is<br/>
about 2/3 of the way to the point.<br/>
<br/>
Walk 12 paces (36 feet).<br/>
<br/>
Turn right 40 degrees, walk into the undergrowth 5 paces (15 feet).<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox is under a log at the base of a Madrona tree.   After you've<br/>
returned the box safely to it's hiding place you'll want to continue out to<br/>
the point where you can see Wescott Bay, from where some of the world's best<br/>
oysters are reported to be harvested.<br/>
<br/>
The volunteer that was there the day we planted the box suggested returning<br/>
to the trailhead on the Garrison Bay trail the same way we went out to the<br/>
point.  Apparently it's a much more pleasant trail than the eastern section.<br/>
We followed his advice, so I don't know what the other part of the trail is<br/>
like, but either way you'll end up back at the trailhead where you started.<br/>
<br/>
Another fun stop on San Juan island if you have time is Snug Harbor.  Small,<br/>
but very cool.  We might try to stay there next time.....hope you enjoy the<br/>
island!<br/>
