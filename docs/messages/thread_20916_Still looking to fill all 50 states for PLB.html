About 6 weeks ago, I started the 50 Nifty United States Postal <br/>
Letter Box.  The goal of this box is to get a stamp from one person <br/>
in each of the 50 states.  The people involved and I have had a <br/>
great time following it's travels.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still lacking a few states ... I thought with all the new <br/>
members here at LbNA that there might be someone who is from one of <br/>
the missing states that would like to receive this box.<br/>
<br/>
You can e-mail me off-list to get more information and/or sign up.<br/>
<br/>
These are the states that are missing: Arizona, Idaho, Wyoming, <br/>
North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Kentucky, <br/>
Alabama, West Virginia, Vermont, Hawaii<br/>
<br/>
All other states are represented and are not available for signing <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for indulging me and letting my put the PLB info up on this <br/>
list.<br/>
