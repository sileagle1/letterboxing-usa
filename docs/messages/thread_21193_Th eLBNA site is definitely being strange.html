I am posting here because I am impatient and hope to get a quicker <br/>
answer. I have been having a hard time adding a box (my 40th so i <br/>
have some experience.)  I usually type in the clues directly, but <br/>
last night, even though I got prompts saying my box was added, it <br/>
was not.  I copied the long section of clues into a notepad document <br/>
and tried cutting and pasting into a new try this morning.  Still no <br/>
good.  I tried posting this afternoon,...just typing in "This is a <br/>
test" and that did get posted.   But when I try to cut and paste my <br/>
clues into the "Clues" section, they do not appear.  Only the words <br/>
I typed directly.."this is a test" appear.  I am not sure what I am <br/>
doing wrong, I have cut and pasted like this before and it always <br/>
worked.  <br/>
<br/>
I would not want to have to retype all those clues!<br/>
<br/>
any ideas?<br/>

We'll work on a more permanent fix, but you should be able to add your box<br/>
now.<br/>
