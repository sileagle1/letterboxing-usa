I think something that can be pasted right in your letterboxing journal is <br/>
appropriate. I make up name badge-sized stickers on my computer for first finds. <br/>
They're small enough to fit in the box and in the first finder's journal.<br/>

We've always included a first finders 'award' or whatever you want <br/>
to call it. I made a little certificate type if thing and placed an <br/>
image of the stamp on it and signed it, kinda like an atrist signing <br/>
thier work, not that I'm an artist when it comes to carving stamps <br/>
let me be the first to say!<br/>

&gt; Steve, this is unacceptable. You know very well we all eagerly await<br/>
&gt; your sage opinion on any and all topics. Making us wait for your<br/>
&gt; exalted guidance is not only cruel but highly unusual.<br/>

I offer my humblest of apologies and the most sincerest of requests for<br/>
understanding in this slipup.  You see, although I have no excuse, I do have<br/>
a reason....<br/>
<br/>
I was going to use the famous "But I was dead and couldn't answer" then<br/>
realized that wouldn't work, I couldn't get a note from my doctor. I was<br/>
going to claim grave illness that kept me in bed, but I couldn't get a note<br/>
from my mother.  It was at that point that I realized that I had no choice<br/>
but to (gasp!) tell the truth.  I was otherwise detained and kept from<br/>
internet access (Yes, I know) whilst in Las Vegas on my honeymoon.  Suffice<br/>
it to say, that'll not happen again!  (grin!!!)<br/>

Suffice<br/>

car rental kinda hampered us as well.  The schedule was hectic to say the<br/>
least, we went and did dinner at The Tournament of Kings on Thursday, and<br/>
then Sirens of TI after that, on Friday we were in the Adventuredome all day<br/>
and then we saw Ray Stevens in concert that evening and then Cirque Du<br/>
Soliel (Mystere) after that, then Saturday we did the StarTrek Experience<br/>
all day (What a thrill for an old Trekkie like me) then went and did dinner<br/>
at Ba-Da-Bing then off to catch Lord of The Dance (Awesome!). Sunday was<br/>
spent at the CyberSpeedway then we came back up the strip and caught the<br/>
Manhattan Express, then Ride for Atlantis, then caught Masquerade in the<br/>
Sky, then off to the Luxor to see The Blue man Group (Totally Awesome, we<br/>
managed to buy the painting they made that night!!! and seeing them was a<br/>
surprise for Kris, it's her favorite group.) and then Monday was spent at<br/>
the Airport waiting on Standby as we were ready to come home and didn't want<br/>
to wait for the Redeye we were booked on later that night (To no avail, we<br/>
ended up spending the day in the airport anyways)<br/>
<br/>
All in all a wonderful time and we even managed to come out ahead on the<br/>
gambling as well. Lost at slots but won at Blackjack.<br/>

<br/>
We usually leave a business card size First Finder Award that is <br/>
printed on glossy paper. <br/>
<br/>
I thought it would be nice to keep it small so it could be placed <br/>
into a logbook if the finder wanted to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn't heard of the keychain charms before I discovered <br/>
letterboxing, so it never crossed my mind to put in something <br/>
dimensional for "First-ies"<br/>
<br/>
I put a picture in the files area, if you'd like to see.  Here is <br/>
the link: http://tinyurl.com/3ypby<br/>
<br/>
I'd be interested in hearing what others put in for First Finders, <br/>
too.  Thanks for the subject thread.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

My tip: Leave a spot on the face of it to make a stamp image in your <br/>
own colors, the way you envision it ought to look. I designed what I <br/>
think is a really cool looking certificate, but I'm now regretting <br/>
that I left that out.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from that, go nuts.<br/>
