So now you can't see, and there's still that bear?  I've never had a bear attack me, so I'm not an authority.  I have woken up while backpacking and one was sniffing my tent.  I was right up against the mesh lining, so all I saw was a bear nose in front of my face.  I just waiting and it left, I didn't have anything it wanted.  I've seen plenty of bears while hiking, and have always had them run the other way.  I've even had them walk through my camp and stare up at my food hanging from a tree, while I was sitting there.  I've always left them alone and they go away.  I've heard that if they chase you you've done something to their young or you have something that smells fantastic on you.  If it's the first, then you deserve it, if it's the latter, give the food to them!  Knowledge will help you more than bear spray.  I'm not saying there is one specific thing that you should do, because all cases are not the same.  But I just think there's something else you should depend on, not the spray.  Save that for the humans :)</div> <div> </div> <div>Kimberly</div> <div>aka MartianMaggot</div> <blockquote> <div>----- Original Message -----</div> <div><b>From:</b> cowpost</div> <div><b>Sent:</b> Wednesday, July 11, 2001 9:46 AM</div> <div><b>To:</b> letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com</div> <div><b>Subject:</b> Re: [LbNA] What's in your pack</div> <div> </div>Great tip--I did not even KONOW there was bear guard!

consider my self lucky that I saw them.  Generally they were headed<br/>

On a different topic I would be sure that I was familiar with the use of<br/>
a map and compass before I relied on a GPS.   I have never managed to ge<br/>
so lost that I couldn't find myself on the map (but then again I have<br/>
never hiked in  a topographically featureless region as I expect the<br/>

Something else you might consider adding to your pack, particularly for<br/>
long outings, is a little bottle of water purification tablets.<br/>

Actually if you are referring to their Sept 2000 article that is <br/>
_not_ what it says. I originally learned about bear spray from an <br/>
earlier backpacker article. In part the Sept 2000 article says:<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
Dr. Herrero, a noted researcher of bear behavior and attacks, along <br/>
with Andrew Higgins, a university colleague, examined 66 field cases <br/>
in which various brands of spray were used on black and grizzly bears <br/>
that displayed behavior ranging from overly curious to actively <br/>
aggressive toward humans. They concluded that, "while we don't know <br/>
how these encounters would have ended in the absence of spray, the <br/>
use...appears to have prevented injury in most cases," Dr. Herrero <br/>
says.<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
As they note in the article it is a last resort when you really feel <br/>
you are in danger of being mauled, not just for curious bears. My <br/>
point is if you are going to carry a weapon (and spray is a weapon <br/>
though not lethal) it is best to carry the most powerful available. <br/>
Hopefully you won't ever need it for a bear, much more likely a <br/>
human. If it came down to it and I was charged by an aggressive bear <br/>
(or boar, gator, human etc..) I would rather have the most powerful <br/>
spray available than only my hands. No false security for me, just a <br/>
last resort if it came to that.<br/>

<div>This may sound strange, but as 
a Federal law enforcement officer, in order to be "qualified" to carry and use 
"pepper spray"  we must be sprayed with it. I am so glad they don't use the 
same premises about carrying my issued handgun. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The reason behind this 
training is to know just how you will react when coming in contact with the 
stuff.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As a human voice of experience, it is not fun stuff to encounter 
and the effects stays with you for a long time (hours).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My point is, ANY pepper spray 
or chemical agent must be handled with caution. It is very indiscriminant. 
It is just as easy to be on the receiving end of a dose intended for an animal 
if you are not aware of whether it has a stream or a mist and how far it will 
carry and take into account the wind. As a rule, unless you are in a VERY 
active bear area, and have had some kind of "training" with the spray, I 
wouldn't carry it. I have had two, day time eastern Black bear encounters 
while hiking and back packing. In both, the bears were in a very big hurry to 
get away from me. I also take the required precaution while backpacking to hang 
a bear bag at night, at least 100 - 150 feet from my tent, for ALL 
food items including things like cooking pots and pans, Chap Stick, tooth past, 
cloths items with spilled food on it. ANYTHING that a four legged friend might 
think smells like food. Also I cook away from my sleeping area and place my 
backpack 20-30 feet away from the tent too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would also check with your 
local hiking and outdoor adventure, equipment store. The guys who know 
their local area and get their recommendations....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My two cents.....</div>

With so much concern for bears... I am sure that most<br/>
of you live in bear country... It's big news when a<br/>
bear wanders southeastern New Wngland... I suggest you<br/>
read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods." Yes it is a<br/>
little comical, you find yourself laughing most of the<br/>
time, but he deals handily with the subject of bears,<br/>
bear deterance and avoidance. He also has a list of<br/>
books written by people who have either studied bears<br/>
or survived bear attacks. It may not be what you want<br/>
to do, but it is really great reading in any case...<br/>

&gt;HI Gang,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;With so much concern for bears... I am sure that most<br/>
&gt;of you live in bear country... It's big news when a<br/>
&gt;bear wanders southeastern New Wngland... I suggest you<br/>
&gt;read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods." Yes it is a<br/>
&gt;little comical, you find yourself laughing most of the<br/>
&gt;time, but he deals handily with the subject of bears,<br/>
&gt;bear deterance and avoidance. He also has a list of<br/>
&gt;books written by people who have either studied bears<br/>
&gt;or survived bear attacks. It may not be what you want<br/>
&gt;to do, but it is really great reading in any case...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
