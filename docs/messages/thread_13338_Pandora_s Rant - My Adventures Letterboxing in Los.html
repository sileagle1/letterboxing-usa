I am cringing just reading your account. I am so glad you made it out and are <br/>
recovering. I am sending you all my good thoughts! <br/>
<br/>
I don't know if Sir Balthazar told you, but during a discussion of injuries <br/>
last week, he let on to us a hint of your adventure (but he wanted to leave the <br/>
story to you to tell the group - and boy! You REALLY had an adventure!). We <br/>
had decided then that you must receive the Letterboxing Purple Heart stamp <br/>
(circulated only to those injured in the line of Letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
It is currently en route to me for my dog attack adventure with my dog last <br/>
week. As soon as I stamp in, I am then going to send it along to you.  <br/>
So sit back, relax and follow the doctor's orders for a while and this stamp <br/>
will find you.<br/>
<br/>
Stay well!<br/>

<br/>
I am very sorry to hear of your misadventures.  Perhaps it was a bit too much <br/>
of a good thing.  My daugther and I have gone to the Millard Falls box, the <br/>
missing sign is confusing but the hike to the Falls really is only 1/2 mile.  I <br/>
have taken 3-4 year olds to the Falls, a slow journey but not trumatic.  <br/>
Letterboxing is so much fun its hard to know when to stop but accidents happen <br/>
most often when we are tired and in a hurry.<br/>
May you heal quickly!<br/>
Wallis<br/>
