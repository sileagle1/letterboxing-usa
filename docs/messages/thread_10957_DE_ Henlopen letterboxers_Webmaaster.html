                    <html><body>Good news!  I have just spoken with Superintendent Patrick Cooper of Cape Henlopen State Park, who says that approval for letterboxing in the park has just been received from on high.  He is holding the letterboxes that were planted on the Cape until we owners arrive to replace them.<br/>
<br/>
He asks that anyone desiring to plant a letterbox in any of the Delaware state parks first check with the park office to let them know where the boxes will be planted; their guidelines stipulate that boxes should be hidden close to trails and not in closed areas.  <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile,  I am embarrassed to say that when I asked the Webmaster to remove the Henlopen Tower clues, I did not keep a copy for myself.  Duh!  Did anyone  happen to keep a copy that you can forward to me?  Does the Webmaster keep these in a discard file for a period of time?<br/>
<br/>
Finally, is there anyone who found the Henlopen Tower box before it was removed who would be able to pick it up from the park office and replace it?  We will not be out there again until summer.  We would like to get it back out before then.  Thanks!<br/>
