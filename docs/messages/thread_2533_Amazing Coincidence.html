<div>I went out today and not only got four boxes, but I 
also got three exchanges!  At 2 different places I met other 
letterboxers.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went out alone in the morning to Fisherman's 
point and as I sat stamping in, a couple hiked up and we exchanged.  Then I 
drove to meet my friend Mary Jane and we went to The Pyramid series.  When 
I went into the visitor center we passed a couple who were beginning a 
hike.  We headed in and passed the last landmark before we were 
supposed to start looking for clues.  A little further up the trail 
the couple was taking a break on the side of the trail.  After we 
walked past them, I remembered that I wanted to check something back at the last 
landmark just in case I read it wrong and we turned back and passed the couple 
again as they were just starting to go again.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After making sure that I had read the clue right we 
again turned back up the same trail to seek the last clue to that box.  As 
the final landmark came into view up ahead on the trail I could see exactly 
where the letterbox was supposed to be.  I could also see that that same 
couple was sitting below it taking another rest.  What a coincidence.  
While we were at a distance, I pointed out to Mary Jane where the box was 
supposed to be and said to her, "Lets just walk over to it like we're taking a 
break and not let on what we're doing."  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So I went up and sat between the stone pile and the 
couple like I was resting.  I casually turned and flipped a rock and then 
another - no letterbox!.  I turned back to see two smiling faces.  One 
of them held up the box and said, "Are you looking for this?"  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So much for being sneaky.  It was nice to see 
some of the faces that are behind the words on this group.  Ironically, one 
of them had placed the box that caused me my duress two weeks earlier.  I'm 
glad we could laugh about it.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So to Martian Maggot, her friend, Pam &amp; Todd I 
just wanted to say that it was great to see you.</div>

<div>Happy Boxing,</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was great fun meeting Forester and friend. It was our first time<br/>
meeting another boxer on the trail. We were trying to act nonchalont in<br/>
case the two of them  were just another pair of hikers but when it became<br/>
clear that we had what they were looking for, the gig was up!  Its nice<br/>
that the sport has grown to the point where these sort of chance meetings<br/>
can occur.  <br/>
	We have placed another set of NJ boxes this time in the Sourland<br/>
preserve in Somerset County.  Its a great park that has only been in<br/>
existance as a county park since 1998. We will post the clues later.<br/>
