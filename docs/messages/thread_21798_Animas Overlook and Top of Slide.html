Yeah, you can get by the construction just fine, but three weeks ago <br/>
there was still a foot of snow on the road by the campground. Probably <br/>
a lot more at the overlook. I'll send you a note offlist and let you <br/>
know what it looks like after this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Top of the Slide, the Budster can only blame themselves for <br/>
that hike since they planted it in 2002. Go Budster!<br/>

I just moved from Pagosa Springs last spring.  From previous <br/>
messages it sounds like your boxes may be in/near Durango, but I <br/>
didn't notice them on the map.  Am I right?  The Animas flows right <br/>
through town and there's a college there so it seemed to match up <br/>
with the other LB mentioned.<br/>

Yes, I'm in Durango. It's hard to get to the clues around here from the <br/>
map at LBNA. When you click on SW Colorado the Northwest Region boxes <br/>
are listed and vice versa. Also there are counties around here that <br/>
only show up on the Eastern Colorado list. Wes told me that they are <br/>
making a list of problems like these to deal with all at once instead <br/>
of fixing them one by one.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you were able to look for the letterbox near Pagosa Springs <br/>
while you were there. It's a Drewclan box, and I highly recommend it.<br/>

Unfortunatly i didn't get hooked on the LB until I moved to MO.  I <br/>
do have a 2 week trip planned to Pagosa this summer and would <br/>
certainly love the chance to track down your boxes.  If I send a <br/>
couple boxe your way would you plant them for me?  It would be cool <br/>
to see who has checked in by the time I  get there.  i also bring <br/>
along a few HHs to leave.<br/>
