FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS<br/>
<br/>
IN OUR TIME a letterbox was hidden. No need to travel to THE GREEN <br/>
HILLS OF AFRICA, it is right here in the United States. TO HAVE AND <br/>
HAVE NOT a compass is no big deal. It was THE DANGEROUS SUMMER and I <br/>
think there was a DEATH IN THE AFTERNOON. But that is what you can <br/>
expect when you have MEN WITHOUT WOMEN.  I traveled to THE GARDEN OF <br/>
EDEN where THE SUN ALSO RISES.  I visited the gravesite and a <br/>
monument to THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA.  From the monument, it was 20 <br/>
steps to the right along THE TORRENTS OF SPRING. There were no <br/>
ISLANDS IN THE STREAM and no need to go ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE <br/>
WOODS. Beside a concrete slab and a square green box is a clump of <br/>
trees and in the middle of the trees is a letterbox. WINNER TAKE <br/>
NOTHING, just an imprint of the stamp to add to your book.  A <br/>
FAREWELL TO ARMS until the next letterbox hunt!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to read the waiver of responsibility and liability!  AND BE <br/>
DISCREET!!!!<br/>
