been passed up by someone who was trying to plant another <br/>

&gt; If you were following the wire fence, then you were right on <br/>
course. After a short bit, the mixed hardwoods changed to all <br/>
pines, all of a sudden, and just a short way into them there was <br/>
a large, lone oak, really big with bare branches. As for #l, after <br/>
you crossed the dam, did you go to the field to look for the path? <br/>
Or did you take the path (i think there was one) just at the end of <br/>
the dam. If I remember right, the clues said to go almost to the <br/>
field. Anyway, there could well have been other letterboxers there. <br/>
So, good luck next time! And don't forget to look for #4.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmmm..  I think we took the path to the left right after the dam.  Should <br/>
we have gone further?<br/>
<br/>
I actually called the park to ask if they could fax a map.  The ranger said <br/>
she would but it hasn't come through yet.  We will not give up hope!  I just <br/>
really wish I could figure out our booboo!<br/>
<br/>
On number three, I'm glad it was the right fence.  The wooden fence looked <br/>
like private property.  We found different groups of felled trees but never <br/>
a big oak.  I think we were in panic mode by then!<br/>
<br/>
We will definitely look for #4 but I think we have to find #3 to know where <br/>
to start from.  Maybe we will try and go backwards to #3 (like we'll ever <br/>
find the convoluted paths we used to finally make our way out of there!...)<br/>
<br/>
I really want to find #1 though because it seemed so straight forward!  I <br/>
hope the weather holds for this weekend.  How can we find the paths when <br/>
they are covered with snow?  (probably no better than we did when they were <br/>
covered with leaves!...)  It may be the time to try some of the urban DC <br/>
boxes!  The kids are dying to go on a metro train!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your help!  I don't want to spoil anyone else's fun.  We're <br/>
just really curious and a little frustrated.  The hints make us feel better <br/>
:).  BeMa<br/>

&gt; &gt; number of steps wrong but we looked up and down a ways,<br/>
&gt;under the trees.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The ground was all covered in a thin layer of pine needles.<br/>
&gt;The only bunch<br/>
&gt; &gt; of sticks was near the intersection (that's why we though<br/>
&gt;froggy-sized<br/>
&gt; &gt; paces) but there was nothing under the sticks.  I'm not sure<br/>
&gt;what we would<br/>
&gt; &gt; do differently or what we did wrong.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What's the possibility or missing the box while someone else<br/>
&gt;was using it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; It did happen to us at the Wildflowers box (but we went on a<br/>
&gt;spying mission,<br/>
&gt; &gt; sighted the boxers and waited for them to finish).  Who had the<br/>
&gt;box?  Fess<br/>
&gt; &gt; up!....  Maybe they were putting the hitchhiker in at that time,<br/>
&gt;someone far<br/>
&gt; &gt; away where they couldn't hear us pacing up and down?!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We would love a little hint from someone (please....)  Was it<br/>
&gt;supposed to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; under that big pile of sticks?  Is there a tricky part we missed?<br/>
&gt;HELP!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And now, pathetically, I will ask how you all knew which pine<br/>
&gt;trees for #3?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course, we may have been completely off the path by then<br/>
&gt;but we did<br/>
&gt; &gt; follow the fence (it was wire).  Any thought?  Thanks!  BeMa<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you were following the wire fence, then you were right on<br/>
&gt;course. After a short bit, the mixed hardwoods changed to all<br/>
&gt;pines, all of a sudden, and just a short way into them there was<br/>
&gt;a large, lone oak, really big with bare branches. As for #l, after<br/>
&gt;you crossed the dam, did you go to the field to look for the path?<br/>
&gt;Or did you take the path (i think there was one) just at the end of<br/>
&gt;the dam. If I remember right, the clues said to go almost to the<br/>
&gt;field. Anyway, there could well have been other letterboxers there.<br/>
&gt;So, good luck next time! And don't forget to look for #4.<br/>

&gt; Hmmmm..  I think we took the path to the left right after the <br/>
dam.  Should <br/>
&gt; we have gone further?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I actually called the park to ask if they could fax a map.  The <br/>
ranger said <br/>
&gt; she would but it hasn't come through yet.  We will not give up <br/>
hope!  I just <br/>
&gt; really wish I could figure out our booboo!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On number three, I'm glad it was the right fence.  The wooden <br/>
fence looked <br/>
&gt; like private property.  We found different groups of felled trees <br/>
but never <br/>
&gt; a big oak.  I think we were in panic mode by then!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We will definitely look for #4 but I think we have to find #3 to <br/>
know where <br/>
&gt; to start from.  Maybe we will try and go backwards to #3 (like <br/>
we'll ever <br/>
&gt; find the convoluted paths we used to finally make our way out <br/>
of there!...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really want to find #1 though because it seemed so straight <br/>
forward!  I <br/>
&gt; hope the weather holds for this weekend.  How can we find the <br/>
paths when <br/>
&gt; they are covered with snow?  (probably no better than we did <br/>
when they were <br/>
&gt; covered with leaves!...)  It may be the time to try some of the <br/>
urban DC <br/>
&gt; boxes!  The kids are dying to go on a metro train!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for your help!  I don't want to spoil anyone else's fun.  <br/>
We're <br/>
&gt; just really curious and a little frustrated.  The hints make us <br/>
feel better <br/>
&gt; :).  BeMa<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To find #3, do what the clues say: Follow Vestal's Gap Rd. back <br/>
(look at the map you got at the Visitors' Center). You'll go past a <br/>
boulder with some info about the road, along a grassy area past <br/>
a wooden crossbar, and finally back into the woods. Keep going, <br/>
past a bench on the left (but no trail there) till you find the bench <br/>
and the trail to the left with the orange arrow . You can either go <br/>
left to #4 or straight ahead to #3. As for #1, all I can say is, follow <br/>
the clues: Go almost to the field and look for a trail on the left.<br/>
Good hunting!<br/>
