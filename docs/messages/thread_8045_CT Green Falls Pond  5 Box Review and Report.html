are all intact and dry. Allow extra time for the searching. They are <br/>
not all easy. The trees are blazed in blue along the trail but is not <br/>
as well marked as I expected. Terrain is a little rough at times <br/>
especially at the beginning along the side of a high steep hill. The <br/>
views and sights along the way are great and well worth the hike. You <br/>
do have to allow extra time though. Don't be like me and start late. <br/>
You don't want to get caught out there with darkness coming in. It's <br/>
not a trail you can or ever would want to hurry on. Some of the finds <br/>
are tough but I have never been to the area before and found all 5 by <br/>
the instruction sheet. Molly and I had a great, memorable hike and <br/>
get to add 5 finds to our counts. Not bad. Thanks for planting them.<br/>
