Caribbean cruise. I got a chance to hit one letterbox in Key West <br/>
which took me to an area I had never explored and the box was <br/>
dry and in good shape. We left a little surprise there - the <br/>
"Anchors Away" hitchhiker. Go south for a two-for-one special!<br/>
Now I'm glad to be back to try all the CY ones that were posted in <br/>
our absence!<br/>
