Kaaterskill Falls Letterbox<br/>
Palenville, New York<br/>
<br/>
Placed by CSCM on 20010810.<br/>
<br/>
A 1.5 mile hike, mostly along a steep and rocky trail, partly along a<br/>
mountain highway.  Clues are easy.<br/>
<br/>
Background<br/>
<br/>
I've been coming to this spot since I was a little kid and it never ceases to<br/>
thrill me.<br/>
<br/>
Located within the Catskill Forest Preserve, Kaaterskill Falls are the highest<br/>
waterfalls in New York State. The upper falls is a thin plume dropping<br/>
167 feet<br/>
into a natural amphitheater of rock. The lower falls drop another 64 feet into<br/>
the Kaaterskill Creek stream bed.<br/>
<br/>
Water levels vary significantly at Kaaterskill Falls.  In the spring the<br/>
falls are a roaring cataract, but in late summer the water flow can fade<br/>
to a trickle.  In winter it can freeze into a giant icicle.<br/>
<br/>
The majesty of Kaaterskill Falls was a popular subject for Hudson River School<br/>
artists like Thomas Cole and Asher B. Durand, during the Nineteenth Century.<br/>
Today, Kaaterskill Falls remains a pristine and graceful example of the<br/>
power of<br/>
nature to continually reform our world with the patient perseverance of a<br/>
simple<br/>
stream.<br/>
<br/>
In April 2001, an independent production called "Kaaterskill Falls" [see<br/>
http://www.whiskeyoutpost.com/kf/] was filmed here by Josh Apter and Peter<br/>
Olsen.<br/>
