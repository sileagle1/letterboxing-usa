<br/>
I'd love it if Adrian could explain just a bit more.... I can't quite<br/>
picture it. Is the letterbox in another container in the hole, that<br/>
you could take the top off of and find the letterbox without digging<br/>
a hole? Can you pull up the "plug" without digging or disturbing<br/>
surrounding earth and grass? <br/>
   Not sure how plugging would work in Wisconsin anyhoo, the <br/>
ground would be frozen or difficult to work with around 6 months of<br/>
the year. I take it that the grass is year-round in Dartmoor. When I<br/>
was looking around for places this fall, I was struck by how little<br/>
I knew about how different spots would be appropriate for searching<br/>
at different times of the year. What was quite accessible in October,<br/>
could be under 4 feet of drifts in January, a mud pit or underwater<br/>
in April, or overgrown with brush and weeds in July.<br/>

I would suppose, Deborah, that the hole would have a considerable <br/>
smaller diameter than the plug - we're not trying to catch <br/>
tigers or heffalumps here. The hole might even be formed <br/>
to accommodate the box on its side, which would make an even smaller <br/>
'footprint.'<br/>
