I'm a fifty year old that's fallen in love with this pastime...thanks <br/>
to our local library,which is is running four quests this summer <br/>
(one  new one each week...the third began the 11th...one more to go!)<br/>
The last one is based on the children's book , The Hobbit...the <br/>
others were likewise themed about a different children's book..ie The <br/>
Wizard of Oz,and C.S.Lewis stories.A tolkein fan since boyhood t last <br/>
one is the one that counts for me...i planned to do the others only <br/>
as a prep for the last...but by the middle of the first one I was <br/>
hooked..I was practically waiting at the library door this <br/>
morning,for it to open to get  the clues...which all begin in the <br/>
library someplace..within an hour i was stamping the book,but some 8 <br/>
year old had beat me!!!! lol.Are there any other letterboxers in my <br/>
area and more importantly any quests i can continue with lol<br/>
