                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, OK.  Due to much inquiry and popular demand over the past few months<br/>
I have finally (lazy, I know) posted the clues to the Upper Macleay Park<br/>
series I planted for the summer gathering in Portland.  <br/>
<br/>
I can verify that the letterboxes were there as of this afternoon,<br/>
November 24th.  However, I don't know what condition the boxes are in,<br/>
really.  I didn't open them up or anything due to the high volume of<br/>
human beings and dogs on the Wildwood today.  <br/>
<br/>
It was like rush hour on the Banfield, I swear!  What can you expect in<br/>
this scenic place on such a beautiful day?  It was amazingly clear and<br/>
on the drive up we had EXCELLENT views of not only the usual Mt. St.<br/>
Helens and Mt. Hood sightings, but gorgeous shots of Mt. Adams and Mt.<br/>
Rainier, on this cool, sunny day. Not a cloud in the sky and perfect for<br/>
a Forest Park hike!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the encouragement everyone!  For those of you who have not<br/>
yet nabbed these letterboxes, I hope you can go on a day when it's not<br/>
so crowded and I hope you enjoy the hike and the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
