<div>Hi all,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was thinking about the fact that my letterbox 
(Stone Needle) was visited about 10 times in 8 months.  That includes 3 
checks by me.  That's not exactly enough to wear a trail to the box.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't know if if it's even possible to check this 
out, but it would be real interesting to know which box/boxes are the most 
visited in the US.  That would probably involve either the placer going 
back to check or the next finder counting stamps.  I'm into 
statistics.  I know - it's a guy thing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This knowledge might come in handy in the future if 
LB representatives ever want to prove to public land managers that this 
sport is bringing more visiters to their parks, forests &amp; historic 
sites.  If there's no objection, maybe we could experiment and take a count 
over a couple of weekends.  Either the finder or placer can check in with a 
tally and date checked/found.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> I'm looking forward to your 
imput,</div>
<div> </div>

<p><br/>When counting, do you count a group of 4 letterboxers who have searched
for the box together and all stamping in at the same time as 1 visit or
4?

at the EMS in Waterford CT.<br/>

I am sure Eric can give you a more accurate #<br/>

Walk in Whitehall that I had 'repaired' not too long ago. I periodically<br/>
check on the boxes that EMS has placed. If anyone ever has an news about<br/>
those boxes, just post to the list and I'll check them out if then need<br/>
repairing. Hmmm, haven't counted the number of stamps in the book at the<br/>
store... will have to see how full Elaine and Jerry's current book is now.<br/>
