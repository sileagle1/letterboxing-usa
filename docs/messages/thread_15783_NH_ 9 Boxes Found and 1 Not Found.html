                    <div class="plaintext-content">We did a few boxes in New Hampshire this weekend and here are the results:<br/>
Found NH Forest in Concord<br/>
Found Tombstone in Manchester (we appear to be first finders on this,<br/>
but perhaps the logbook was changed out since it's been in place since<br/>
March - can't contact Amanda from Seattle 'cuz there's no link on her<br/>
webpage where the clue is posted, so I don't know for sure)<br/>
Found Ponemah Bog in Amherst along with the Wish Upon A Star Hitchhiker<br/>
Found Gilson Road Cemetary and NH Ghosts in Nashua<br/>
Found Mine Falls Park in Nashua<br/>
Found Sea Song Mystery in Portsmouth<br/>
Found Portsmouth Harbor Light in New Castle (the stamp pad is dead in<br/>
this one- it needs to be replaced. Also one of the compass bearings is<br/>
off as multiple people have noted in the logbook. This may account for<br/>
some of the missing reports.)<br/>
Did NOT find Hear the Sea in New Castle (this one has several other<br/>
missing reports and according to those who had found it before was an<br/>
easy find, so my guess is that it is gone)<br/>
Found Live Free or Die in New Castle (the bottom of this stamp is<br/>
broken off, but it is still stampable)<br/>

You are not the first.  The logbook must have been replaced because <br/>
in August we were the last to stamp into a full logbook.  Glad to <br/>
hear that the Tombstone is still in action.<br/>
