Pigs</p>
<p align="left"># of Boxes: 3</p>

<p align="center"><u>The Three Little Pigs</u></p>
<p align="center">as told by A. Wolf</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="left">Have you ever wondered <u>where</u> the three little pigs lived? 
Did you ever think, maybe the wolf wasnt so bad, maybe, just maybe he was 
simply misunderstood?</p>
<p align="left">Come visit the Eleanor Flood Reed Preserve and Ill walk you 
through the events of that terrible day.</p>
<p align="left">I had a terrible cold, and was trying to make myself some chicken 
soup to cure it. Right in the middle of everything, I realized that I had no 
noodles! Now I dont know about you, but for me, chicken soup just isnt right 
without the noodles! Well, if you have ever been in my neck of the woods, you 
will know that there are no stores to be found, at least not within walking 
distance. With my cold and the cold medicine I had taken, I knew I shouldnt be 
driving. So, I left my house and started walking down the lane to find a 
neighbor.</p>
<p align="left">I hadnt been walking for long, when I came to a fork in the road. 
I decided that I would be better off on the main path, so I continued walking 
straight.</p>
<p align="left">After traveling for a short while I noticed a very strange sight. 
On my left was a small pond with a stone wall running right through it. Behind 
the pond was a large rock hill covered with cedars and nestled in the cedars was 
a small hut. The mailbox said "Little Pig" and I though I saw someone scurrying 
around so I made my way up the steep side of the hill, huffing and puffing all 
the way. </p>
<p align="left">When I finally got to the top, I was so out of breath, that I 
could not even talk. Instead I just stood there at the door to this hut panting 
and coughing like a crazy wolf. I dragged my weak self over to an uprooted tree 
near the front of the ledge and knocked on the door of the tiny house nestled 
within the roots. Then, just as the little pig, answered the door, I let out the 
biggest sneeze ever. Well, the poor little pig and his flimsy house blew right 
to the bottom of the hill! </p>
<p align="left">I asked the little pig if he was all right. He just yelled and 
screamed to get off his hill. So I ran right down to road and continued on my 
way. I ran over the bridge of stones hoping that no trolls lived nearby. 
Eventually I came to an intersection numbered 4, but this is a new road, so I 
though I better stick to the main road that I had traveled many times before. 
</p>
<p align="left">Watching out for the angry little pig, I made my way up a hill and 
past a stone wall. Ledges appeared on my right, and then I carefully tiptoed 
through the swampy part of the road. Ducking down I traveled on, under a leaning 
tree and finally to an area with lots of boulders. The road took a sharp right, 
and rose into a rocky valley and then took a sharp left. I followed the path 
right again past a sign reading "Overlook Loop". After passing 5 more blue 
arrows the lane turned right down a hill. As I looked off to my left, I noticed 
another small house, tucked behind a triple trunk tree. I neared the house which 
was built in a hollow behind this tree, and read the sign by the door "M.S. Pig 
Jr.". </p>
<p align="left">I knocked and prepared myself to ask this kind pig for some 
noodles, when I was hit with another sneezing attack. The pig, mistaking my 
cold, for a bad temper, slammed the door in my face and yelled at me to get 
lost!</p>
<p align="left">Well, people always think that we wolves are the bad ones, but I 
dont know where they got that idea. Pigs seem to be the most unfriendly animals 
around!</p>
<p align="left">I decided to keep going. Not everyone who lives in this forest can 
be so nasty, I thought. As I continued on I noticed a sign that pointed the way 
back to the lane. I followed it and turned left to return the way I had come, 
back through the swamp and up the road.</p>
<p align="left">I came to a #5 on my left and followed the path a short way to 
find an old foundation. I seem to remember my grandfather, B.B. Wolf telling me 
something about that house. Maybe Ill remember when my head clears up. </p>
<p align="left">Back on the lane, a few steps further I decided to take a left 
onto Red Road at the 4. This lane is new and sometimes hard to follow with all 
the orange ribbons tied here and there. My head was really foggy by this time 
with all the walking I had done, and the lack of food. Also, I think the 
medication was starting to wear off. </p>
<p align="left">I followed the marks as carefully as I could, sometimes by a 
soothing stream that could have put me to sleep. I remember a rock wall 
appearing on my left, and then the trail moving away from it as I twisted and 
turned over a rocky stretch. I passed #3 and realized that both the high road 
and the low road came out at the same point just a little further on by #2. I 
walked on and on, my poor tummy rumbling in search of noodles for my now chilly 
soup. Even the smell of skunk cabbage nearby, started to smell appetizing. </p>
<p align="left">Finally the path crossed the stream on some rocks. I was so sleepy 
by this point that I tripped over a fallen log in the path. Lucky I did, because 
otherwise I would not have noticed the house at its rocky, rooty end. Between 
the two largest rocks I saw the flat stone doorway. I knocked and checked to be 
sure that I was not breathing too loudly and that no sneezing fits were coming 
on. I saw a small eye peek out the door. The pig, peeked out his window and 
hollered, "Nobodys home, scram wolf!" Thinking back now that my cold is gone, I 
know that the pig was indeed home. I was just so tired and so sick by then that 
I believed that no one was home and started on my way home without my noodles. I 
followed Red Road for a while, turning right before a field and stone wall. 
Then, left at the end and back to my home.</p>

<p align="center">Driving Directions: From the intersection of Route 164 and Route 
165 in Preston, travel south. Take your first left onto Northwest Corner Road, 
and stay left when the road splits. Follow this road for about 1.6 miles. The 
road takes a sharp turn to the left, go straight into the driveway. If you 
continue to the bar you will see the sign for the Eleanor Flood Reed Woodlands. 
Park by the gate or on the edge of the driveway. Please be careful not to block 
the driveway, this is someones private home.</p></div></body></html>
