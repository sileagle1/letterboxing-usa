I would say I stamp "in" the log book that's in the letterbox, and <br/>
stamp "up" in my own log book  :-)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Help!<br/>
&gt; I admit a certain ignorance of all computer related <br/>
&gt; correspondence so please<br/>
&gt; take that into consideration.  I thought that letterboxing <br/>
&gt; would be great<br/>
&gt; for my kids and I this summer however, the one letterbox <br/>
&gt; listed on your<br/>
&gt; website for Dallas (Bob Woodruff Park) seems to have <br/>
&gt; disappeared.  I notice<br/>
&gt; that it was placed there in 1998 and wondered if there is a <br/>
&gt; way to find out<br/>
&gt; if we just missed it or if it has indeed disappeared.  My <br/>
&gt; kids were really<br/>
&gt; disappointed that we didn't find it and so was I.  I would <br/>
&gt; like to try one<br/>
&gt; now that is perhaps more current.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, is there a way for us to find other letterboxes in a <br/>
&gt; specific area<br/>
&gt; such as TX?  I stumbled onto the WebRing, but I am not sure <br/>
&gt; how to use it or<br/>
&gt; how to determine the areas of the boxes without investigating <br/>
&gt; each and every<br/>
&gt; listing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope you are the right person to ask.<br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>

 We tried to find the first letterbox in Eaton Canyon (it was my daughter and <br/>
 my's first solo attempt at letterboxing)  and we couldn't find it.  Do you <br/>
 know how many five trunked trees there are in Eaton Canyon?!!  Plus after <br/>
you <br/>
 cross the creek, there's not really a fork, it' s more a T , through there <br/>
is <br/>
 a small path running amost straight ahead and perhaps we will go back and <br/>
try <br/>
 that path.  Anybody know anything about this site?  Eaton Canyon is in <br/>
 Arcadia, CA<br/>
 We picked this for a first attempt because we know the canyon pretty well <br/>
and <br/>
 we could take two of uor dogs with us.<br/>
