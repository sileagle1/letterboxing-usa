Location: Mansfield CT, Tolland County<br/>
<br/>
Rated: Easy if you know the area! A map of Mansfield may help.<br/>
<br/>
Time to complete: 1/2 hour or less for all 3 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
HINT:<br/>
Inspector Clouseau is at it again, in search of that elusive fuchsia <br/>
feline, The "Pink Panther".  He heard there was a trail in Mansfield <br/>
with PINK DOTS. Surely, that must mean the Pink Panther is hiding <br/>
there. The sly PINK one is believed to be protected by a suspicious <br/>
gang called the "Joshua Tract".<br/>
<br/>
CLUES: <br/>
Inspector Clouseau is waiting for you. He left this message: <br/>
<br/>
"Meet me on the trail with Pink Dots, past the Crest, off of Clark. <br/>
You would have to take the 195 to the 89 to find Clark.  Straight as <br/>
an arrow past the Crest, a short distance. Look to your left, a very <br/>
small spot to park. See an opening in the trees and a small silver <br/>
sign up high on the right.  <br/>
On Ahead... A-HA! The Pink Dot! Get out your magnifying glass<br/>
and start humming Mancini's "Pink Panther" Theme song.           <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Down and straight up, keep your eye on the pink dots. Walk on until <br/>
you meet a very large Hemlock on the left. Look for a suspicious <br/>
little footpath behind the Hemlock.  There are no markings on the <br/>
path.  Make sure no one is following you.  Follow the path down the <br/>
hill, stop at the end of the row of Mountain Laurel. Go about 15 <br/>
paces (count left foot only). See a small pond on the left and a <br/>
clearing on the right.  Look for the largest pine tree on the right <br/>
side of the path.  It has two trunks, split high up, one in front and <br/>
one behind.  I will meet you at the base of that tree. Hurry!"<br/>
~THE INSPECTOR<br/>
<br/>
"I'm glad you made it letterboxer, we must not waste time!" Scurry <br/>
back up the path to the Hemlock tree and bear left to find the Pink <br/>
Dots again. Quickly come to a "Y", go right. Pass a pile of dead <br/>
trees on the right. Follow to a "T".  "What's this, Yellow Dots to <br/>
the left, Pink to the right? We must stay with the Pink Dots!" Keep <br/>
looking on the right and walk until you see two long legs standing <br/>
with a log lying between them. "They are not pink legs, so we must go <br/>
on. But wait, there is something under the log!" THINK PINK!  <br/>
(Be Sure to re-hide the box well. Be sure you cannot see it from all <br/>
sides.)<br/>
<br/>
"Only an imprint! The Pink Phink was here and we missed it!" Look <br/>
ahead, there is Pink on the right and Yellow on the left. Then <br/>
another set of the same. Go through the dots until you meet the <br/>
original trail and stop. "We went in a circle! We've been fooled! <br/>
There has to be one more clue!" Stand facing the original trail. <br/>
Look back over your left shoulder. See the 2 trees standing in "V" <br/>
formation. "Behind them,I think I saw something pink. NO! It is just <br/>
another box! We've been had!"  ~THE GREAT ESCAPE!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Please reseal the boxes tightly and re-hide them so that no one can <br/>
see! <br/>
