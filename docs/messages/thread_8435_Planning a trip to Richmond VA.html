Yes, all of the boxes in Pocahontas State Park are in good shape <br/>
and accounted for as of Sept. 28.  Most all of the boxes in the <br/>
Richmond area are present and accounted for within the last 2 <br/>
months.  So come on and have some boxing fun!<br/>

With the exception of Hollywood Cemetary, all the Richmond boxes are <br/>
in dogs-on-leash-friendly parks and locations.  I can't recall a "No <br/>
Dogs Allowed" posting at Hollywood, but I would guess that if your <br/>
dog was on leash and held close, it would go unnoticed as there are <br/>
rarely too many people around, unless you catch the weekend walking <br/>
tours.  <br/>
<br/>
Maymont Park, although lovely with many great box hiding spots, does <br/>
not allow dogs.  Been there to plant one with Maggie and had to <br/>
leave.  As far as I know, there are no letterboxes there.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and good luck!<br/>
