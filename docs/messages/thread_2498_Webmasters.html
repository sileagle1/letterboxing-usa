First of all, we have been involved with letterboxing for almost a year now <br/>
and I can't tell you how much fun we've had so far. Sure, we've been thwarted <br/>
by rain, snow, bugs, heat, cold, darkness and most assuredly stupidity. But <br/>
we have grown closer and have seen wonderful things together that few can <br/>
even relate to. We have hiked together before but never without the purpose <br/>
that presents itself in letterboxing. A new dimension for sure. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly, If I weren't so computer illiterate I'd help out with maintaining <br/>
our beloved hobby. Is there nothing I can do for you? Please let me know!<br/>
<br/>
I think I'll just say thank you to everyone involved in the format, design <br/>
and forum that is present today within this website. Lets keep perspective of <br/>
what letterboxing is all about. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, we are having a blast.<br/>
