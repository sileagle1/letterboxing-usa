The World's Most Boring Letterbox, Blah Blah Blah.<br/>
Location:  Brooks Park, Lacey, WA, Thurston County<br/>
Placed 9/12/02 by The Nail Family<br/>
<br/>
To get there:  From I-5 take exit # 109 to Martin Way.  Head West <br/>
on Martin Way to College St and turn left.<br/>
Follow College to intersection with Lacey Blvd.  Cross Lacey Blvd <br/>
and look for the brown sign on the immediate right directing to <br/>
Brooks Park behind a yellow building (Qwest).  This is a very <br/>
small rectangular city park located between the<br/>
backyards of a few homes and directly behind the Qwest service <br/>
building.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Enter the parking lot and park.<br/>
Walk to the chain link fence on the north side of the park.  <br/>
Walk westward along the park border.   <br/>
Count 3 railroad ties.  <br/>
World's Most Boring Letterbox is behind the<br/>
3rd  railroad tie near the base of the cedar tree.  <br/>

<br/>
Warning:  It is a boring stamp in a boring park but you'll probably <br/>
go find it anyway since you can't pass up such an easy find.  <br/>
