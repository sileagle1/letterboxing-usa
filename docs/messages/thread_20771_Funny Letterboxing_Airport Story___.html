I went down to visit my mom and do some letterboxing. At the airport <br/>
on the way home I was wearing my LB backpack, but it was full of <br/>
things that wouldn't fit in my suitcase (shoes mostly).  I put it <br/>
thru the carry on screenging machine...and the lady said that there <br/>
was an item that didn't xray, and she needed to search my backpack.  <br/>
I was a little perterbed, but watched as she pulled out my shoes.  <br/>
And pulled out a ROCK.  Not just a tiny rock but a big, round rock.  <br/>
I had put it in there because I found it in my mom's yard, and <br/>
thought it might be helpful in hiding the LB that I was planting that <br/>
day.  Evidently I didn't need it, and had forgotten it was there (no <br/>
wonder my backpack was so heavy...).  I was extremely embarassed as <br/>
the lady asked the other screener if it was ok for me to keep my <br/>
rock, lol.  I told her I didn't want it anyway and that I forgot it <br/>
was in there.  The man behind me said, "I have to ask, why do you <br/>
have a rock in your backpack?!?"  I didn't know what to say so I told <br/>
him it had to do with a game.<br/>
Then I took my backpack and my rock to the ladies room to ditch the <br/>

as <br/>
&gt; &gt; the lady asked the other screener if it was ok for me to keep my <br/>
&gt; &gt; rock, lol.  I told her I didn't want it anyway and that I forgot <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; &gt; was in there.  The man behind me said, "I have to ask, why do you <br/>
&gt; &gt; have a rock in your backpack?!?"  I didn't know what to say so I <br/>
&gt; told <br/>
&gt; &gt; him it had to do with a game.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then I took my backpack and my rock to the ladies room to ditch <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; rock.<br/>

of the first few letterboxes that I placed in the state of Kansas <br/>
were actually carved with an Xacto knife on the plane while I was <br/>

Yes, so many things have changed. That's why I like letterboxing. <br/>
It's low tech, low stress, and family-friendly.<br/>

I have a friend who has a PhD in Art History.  She's a professional<br/>
artist who has friends in minor government posts.  Some medieval<br/>
Italian manuscripts turned up, and it seems they were 'recipes' from a<br/>
medieval Italian artist in how to create certain colors of paint.  She<br/>
got a federal grant to try to duplicate the paints (For her, this was<br/>
one of those jobs where you feel guilty for taking the money :D)  One<br/>
of the components of the red paint was clay from the banks of a<br/>
certain river.  She tried local clay, it didn't work.  She took a trip<br/>
to Italy with the grant money (No time for sight-seeing unfortunately<br/>
:() and found the river.  It was polluted.  The clay along the banks<br/>
was literally black.  Refusing to admit defeat, she checked with the<br/>
historical registry, to learn which houses dated back to the time<br/>
period.  She found several.  One home owner was willing to part with a<br/>
brick from his basement wall.  It even had a brick maker's mark on it<br/>
dating it to the period she needed.<br/>
<br/>
Now she had to come back through customs.  And when she's home, she'll<br/>
have to figure out some way to pulverize this brick literally to dust.<br/>
"What's this?"<br/>
"A brick."<br/>
"A brick?"<br/>
"Yes, a brick."<br/>
"Why are you bringing a brick to the US."<br/>
"Souvenier, see the maker's mark?"<br/>
"How do I know this brick isn't hollow and you're smuggling drugs?"<br/>
"X-ray it."<br/>
They did, it was either completely solid, or impervious to X-rays.<br/>
They broke it in half.  No hollow section.  They broke it in quarters.<br/>
In eighths.  Little bits.  They couldn't understand why she was<br/>
smiling while they were breaking her souvenier. :D :D :D<br/>
<br/>
My other favorite customs story...<br/>
A contractor is flying, with supplies.  His carry-on has the small<br/>
tools that didn't fit in the crate.  It seemes that when you have a<br/>
ball-peen hammer underneath a caulking gun, it has an outline<br/>
remarkably similar to an AK-47 when it goes through a scanner! :D<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL. I got stopped once. Apparently, the small plastic bottles I had <br/>
bought at a discount store to carry small amounts of shampoo and such <br/>
looked just like containers of mace under Xray.......<br/>
<br/>
The one time I *did* carry something aboard (this was VERY pre 9-11) I <br/>
wound up flying anyway. I borrowed a small bag from my mother as a <br/>
carry-on when I was a teenager. We got stopped at the Xray machine. <br/>
They tore that bag apart. They even showed me the Xray and asked what <br/>
it might be. I had no idea. They finally decided it was a zipper Xrayed <br/>
from the side and let me get on teh plane. Soooo, I get all the way to <br/>
Spain and start to unpack..... and find my mother's paring knife lodged <br/>
in teh bottom ofthe side pocket! I wound up leaving it in the hotel <br/>
room, terrified I'd be picked up next time I went over a border. lol<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's another one for the "X (ray) Files"<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college, I was travelling to a national<br/>
band conference that I was invited to play in.  I put<br/>
my instrument on the airport conveyor belt, along with<br/>
my carry-on and purse.  Everything but the instrument<br/>
came through.  So I peeked around the side of the<br/>
X-ray machine to see 3 security guards having an<br/>
argument as to whether it was a flute or a clarinet<br/>
(it was an oboe).  Then on the way home, when it went<br/>
through the X-ray machine, the technician didn't know<br/>
what it was, handed me a screwdriver, and told me to<br/>
"take it apart and take the keys off".  Since this was<br/>
a fairly expensive instrument, I not-so-politely<br/>
declined and asked to speak with security.  Luckily,<br/>
the security guy's daughter was also an oboist, and he<br/>
vouched for me that the object in my case was indeed<br/>
an oboe, and harmless.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I only accepted playing in groups<br/>
that were in driving range from then on!!!<br/>
