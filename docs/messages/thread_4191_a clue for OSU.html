placed 1/8/02<br/>
Franklin County, Ohio<br/>
easy to find.<br/>
1p = 1 step<br/>
<br/>
To find the OSU box first find the campus of OSU.   There are a few<br/>
urban-park-ish areas, and this box is in mayhap one of my favorite spots on<br/>
the campus.<br/>
<br/>
 Off of High Street you'll find some good meter parking on 11th, then make<br/>
for the intersection of 12th and College, which is a block down 12th from<br/>
High Street.  All heading relatively west of course, as you can't really go<br/>
east off of High onto 12th.<br/>
 One of the corners of this intersection vaguely resembles a northwest<br/>
orientation.   Begin Here, at the lamppost, from which a few steps you'll<br/>
find the head of the sidewalk, from which a few steps you'll find a tree.<br/>
 From this tree walk 295 degrees for 190p to a sort of half circle of<br/>
shrubbery.  From here take the sidewalk that wavers neither to the left nor<br/>
to the right pretty much down the center of the park till you find an<br/>
amphitheatre that runs down the side of a hill.<br/>
 At his point you'll need to find a fountain of blue tile that refuses to<br/>
poke its ancient looking self above ground level, but drains into the<br/>
"Mirror Lake."<br/>
 From the fountain walk around the edge of the Lake to the right (when<br/>
facing the lake) 32 paces, then turn towards the hill rising to your right.<br/>
One large step up the stone retaining wall will reveal a hollow tree stump,<br/>
and stuffed in under the dead leaves, the letterbox.<br/>
 Please be careful not to rummage around the hill and stump while folks and<br/>
students are roaming about, close at hand.  Not only might it draw some<br/>
funny looks, but it also could endanger the box.  Also, please replace the<br/>
dead leaves as to conceal the box when you put it back.<br/>
<br/>
 As American college campuses were once (long before my time) vital places<br/>
of political thought, and this box is placed on such a campus, it is placed<br/>
as such with thought and prayer for Aung San Suu Kyi.<br/>
