                    <div class="plaintext-content">I posted the "Ken sings, 'Kensington!'" as a series of four boxes, but originally posted clues only to the first box.  I'm happy to say that Ken, the baby and I ventured out today and planted the next two boxes and three bonus boxes.  <br/>
The clues have been updated on the LBNA website- now only fall's bonus, and both of winter remain.  As soon as I can get back to the park I will put bonus clues in the main box- at that point I'll remove the bonus box clues from the website, I just didn't want someone to  make a trip out there and miss out on half the boxes.<br/>
I expect the whole series to be completed within the month (Ken has to carve the winter stamp- I got the rest of the seasons).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
