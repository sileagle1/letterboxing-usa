                    <div class="plaintext-content">Beldin's other half awoke after a very long slumber to find his <br/>
bodily parts cast asunder, obviously by that malevolent gnome that <br/>
tormented him some time ago.  All that remained was his bottom <br/>
quarters.  Along came a friendly (or fiendly?) traveler that rescued <br/>
him and brought him back to his laboratory where he received <br/>
an `extreme makeover.'  <br/>
<br/>
During this time, Beldin transformed into his alternative form, that <br/>
of a Blue Tailed Hawk and flew North by Northeast to the same <br/>
partially eponymous place as his corporeal self.<br/>
<br/>
After finding damnation by the Pohopoco, he sought refuge at the <br/>
encampment of the Proselytizer, searching perhaps for the Cajun holy <br/>
foodstuffs known as Celery, Bell Peppers and Onions.  Along this <br/>
westerly trail he left the Proselytizers behind, paralleling the <br/>
partially eponymous lake, and sought the beginning of the Piney <br/>
Woods beyond.  At this forest border, he followed a Piney Line <br/>
northish just past the 7th Pine to a short wide log with a <br/>
suspicious single log fragment wedged in the western side.<br/>
<br/>
At was here that the Blue Hawk came to rest..<br/>
