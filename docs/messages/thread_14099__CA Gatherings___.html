&gt; Hey everyone!! I'm a little out of touch these days and was wondering<br/>
&gt; if there are any dates for future gatherings for those of us on the<br/>
&gt; west?  Any info would be greatly appreciated as I haven't been on<br/>
&gt; email too much lately and can't seem to find any messages pertaining<br/>
&gt; to such.  Thanks.  Hopefully I didn't miss them.<br/>
