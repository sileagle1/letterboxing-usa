<br/>
Please reread Randy's thoughts below.  This gels so well with what I <br/>
have been thinking, I just want to see if anyone else is spurred on<br/>
by this.  I think this may be a REAL solution to some of the problems<br/>
and to future potential problems with security.<br/>
<br/>
Randy Hall wrote [@solutions to lost boxes]:<br/>
&gt;  ...set up a database ala ILC; e) check the web server logs to<br/>
&gt;  see who is accessing particular clues -- at least you can know *if* anyone<br/>
&gt;  read the clue, and can often determine their geographical location and<br/>
&gt;  whether they exist outside this group -- for Dan to do this, he would have<br/>
&gt;  to coordinate with his ISP (most do this for free if they are on the ball).<br/>
&gt;  ...While I favor openness, I am against general promotion, as was disussed<br/>
&gt;  at various times previously.  I want the sort of person that seeks out<br/>
&gt;  or discovers letterboxing on their own to be drawn into the hobby.  That<br/>
&gt;  sort of person may need to see maps and clues on a web site to get hooked, &gt;  but that sort of person most likely will not be the jerk who would<br/>
&gt;  vandalize.<br/>
<br/>
I agree very strongly that general (indiscrete) promotion is bad for the hobby. <br/>
In that regard I have always supported the sort of "people network"<br/>
approach passing information along by word of mouth to people we know and<br/>
trust.  I'm sure the hobby will grow more slowly that way, but at least we<br/>
will have some security in knowing our main audience is a trusted group.<br/>
<br/>
And some of the security measures above that Randy has mentioned will go a long<br/>
way toward protecting us from indescrete web users who are bound to stumble onto<br/>
clues information.  I'm not convinced yet that the web has contributed anything<br/>
to vandalism.  And even if it has (though let's find that out first) I feel that<br/>
there are ways to deal with it that would not require us to remove our clues<br/>
from the web.  Chief among them (and in contrast to what Mitch and Randy are<br/>
saying) is that we could lean more toward the Letterbook concept and toward<br/>
keeping boxes closer to the population (in plain public view) rather than having<br/>
them be in remote places.  If a place is real clear and open to public view<br/>
(like downtown) its good -- lots of people around to watch whats going on.  If<br/>
it is real remote and secluded that may  deter detection from thieves (or will<br/>
it?), but it will eliminate the appeal for 95% of people.  Somebody said that a<br/>
"concerned" vandal will leave no stone unturned, so even if the box is far away<br/>
he will go after it nonetheless.  But if the box is in your front yard or in<br/>
your neigbor's front yard the thief will be very weary indeed.<br/>
<br/>
But the thing I like about Randy's suggestion above is that it would make the<br/>
web to operate for us in a similar fashion to the e-mail list.  The members on<br/>
our e-mail list are disclosed to other members who want to see who's on it.  It<br/>
is NOT exclusive.  There is NO anonymity.  Its COMPLETELY OPEN.  You can't just<br/>
lay back in the weeds and gather information and have nobody know who you are. <br/>
And that's good.  But we want to see who is accessing our clues on the web<br/>
also.  That way we will know (within a certain group) who has viewed the clues<br/>
and who may then vandalize our boxes through that information.  It greatly<br/>
reduces (and perhaps it will almost eliminate) abuses on the web.<br/>
<br/>
Also, boxes should be hidden so that people don't just discover them by<br/>
accident.  Your intent should be to make it so that working the clues is<br/>
necessary to discover the box.  That's the main gist of the game. <br/>
<br/>
Yet I want to be clear.  And I don't want to be premature.  Let's find out if<br/>
these boxes were stumbled upon or not.  If they were stumbled upon no amount of<br/>
web security will help our cause and we will just be spinning our wheels as<br/>
reactionaries with a delusional cause.  I think we should wait with this until<br/>
we know more.  And I think it would be a gross over-reaction to start removing<br/>
your clues from the web without knowing more.  If we discover problems that we<br/>
know are the result of a lack of web security then we can install security<br/>
features to protect our clues without losing the convenience and the openess<br/>
the web affords ( Thanks in large part to Randy pointing out the availability of<br/>
the security ).<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, One step at a time.<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time I will check with my ISP to see what can be done in the way of<br/>
passwords, etc. in case we need to go that route.  But let's see what happens<br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Dan'l<br/>

<br/>
I still have trouble believing that someone looking for trouble zeroes<br/>
in on letterboxing on a www search, just HAPPENS to find clues that are<br/>
near enough to his/her location, travels to said location and vandalizes<br/>
the box just for the merry heck of it.  Although the stamps are art,<br/>
they don't have much value to anyone other than us letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
While I don't believe we should be posting clues on telephone poles<br/>
around our sites, I think that posting them on the internet is still<br/>
relatively safe.  A gee-whiz-bang-big-brother-is-watching-you server<br/>
won't take away all the risk.  I suppose if you want to spend the time,<br/>
efort &amp; bandwidth to make it happen, go ahead, but I don't really see<br/>
the point.<br/>

I don't see it as big brother Thom.  The truth is I hope it is not necessary to<br/>
do this.  But certainly if we have to we have to, esp. if the alternative is to<br/>
watch<br/>
our hard work be destroyed.  But like I said, let's wait and see if we need to<br/>
take this step.  We may not have to take it.  Let's wait and see.<br/>

will work if we decide that we need it - but I agree with Dan that we<br/>
should not jump to conclusions too soon.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, if any idividual feels concerned enough to react<br/>
protectively, (s)he can always remove clues and send clues via to<br/>
requests only. I suggest we leave it alone until we know more, altho<br/>
preparing a method as Randy and Dan discuss is also a prudent measure.<br/>
<br/>
I'd just hope that, if we need to institute some sort of web-protective<br/>
measures, we keep it simple - needing to register ala some early ILC<br/>
proposals might deter some potential letterboxers that we'd like to keep<br/>
involved.  KISS<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I greatly enjoyed Thom's and Mitch's recent humor - ROFLMAO Big<br/>
Time.<br/>
