                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got back last night from a two-day trip to the Penobscot Bay in <br/>
Maine. I was driving my son Peter to camp, and took the occasion to <br/>
place a letterbox on Cadillac Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Because of its eastern location plus elevation, Cadillac Mtn. is the <br/>
first place in the USA to see the sun rise. After placing the box <br/>
Wednesday afternoon, we went down to Bar Harbor for lobster (for me, <br/>
prime rib for Peter - he's got 7 weeks of camp food ahead of him!).<br/>
<br/>
After supper, we drove back up the mountain (yep, it's one of those <br/>
with a road to the summit) to see a glorious sunset, went back <br/>
to our tent for a short night's sleep, and then back up the mountain <br/>
to see the sunrise. Even at that hour (4:51), there were about two <br/>
hundred people on the summit.<br/>
<br/>
The clues may be seen at<br/>
<br/>
http://www.sover.net/~tcooch/acadia.htm<br/>
<br/>
There are 6 trivia questions that need to be answered and plugged <br/>
into the clues. They aren't the easiest. Those of you who care for <br/>
that sort of thing can give them a try. You can check your <br/>
answers without having to send them to me, but I would be glad to <br/>
know how you made out.<br/>

getting into mountain bikes. We stopped at the Acadia Bike Shop in <br/>
Bar Harbor, and would have rented bikes if we'd had a little more <br/>
time. (They also rent sea kayaks, which is also very appealing.) <br/>
Maybe in August when I pick him up. I'm hoping to hide a Thunder Hole <br/>
box at that time!<br/>

&gt; Great place for a box!  Easy access (via the road) and a great view.  I<br/>
&gt; have a sister-in-law who owns a business on Mt. Desert Island, so I've been<br/>
&gt; to the top of Cadillac Mountain.  I can't say what was more fun,<br/>
&gt; though...the view from the summit or riding my mountain bike *down* that<br/>
&gt; access road from the top. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll have to hunt this box next time I'm up there!<br/>

You are making me wish that I lived on the East Coast.  Your clues with the<br/>
trivia questions are very cool. <br/>
