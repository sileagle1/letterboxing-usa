Purgatory Chasm was really busy when I went in May.  I was able to get the <br/>
first 3, but not the last (too many people about).  I had a few snacks that <br/>
day waiting to stamp in, but it was great fun.<br/>

Glad to hear that you found 3/4 Purgatory Chasm, and our Wachusett Mt Box.<br/>
<br/>
I like hearing of the first because it indicates that the clues were right<br/>
on the money.<br/>
<br/>
As for the first box, I speculate that it is still there because it is<br/>
well hidden off the trail.  It is the box most likely not to be<br/>
vandelized.<br/>
<br/>
We have another box that we hid this weekend, and we are currently in the<br/>
process of writing up the clues.  We will keep you posted.<br/>
