                    <html><body><div><p>Add another to The Usual Suspects list!   Today I've planted one on Assateague Island, DE. I wanted to plant one closer to Rehoboth, where I am right now, but it's mostly pay-beaches, with no places to plant letterboxes. I'll try to plant one in Cape Henlopen later this week and let you all know.  As it stands, you ought to get to this one before the winter. I'm just hopeing it'll make it through the rainy season without being destroyed or misplaced.</p>

<p>Dunes - Assateague Island, DE.  Nearest city..ummm.. Ocean City, MD?</p>
<p>Drive over the bridge and take left.  Duitifully pay your $5.00 pass to get into the site and drive straight until you see a sign  for the "Life of the Forest" trail. It's on the right. Watch out for ponies.  The trail is a 1/2 mile loop on a boardwalk and it's a pleasent walk.</p>
<p>Take the right trail and make sure to veer left.  Pass a crooked tree in high grass.  Check out the view from the overlook - there are ponies out in the marshes.  Take the right trail back to the parking lot and stop at the freshwater pond. When we were there a pony walked right up and past us (startling me somewhat!) and hung out there drinking for a while.  Past the freshwater pond, around the bend, there is a sand pile to your right and an "island" of loblolly pines to your right.  From the path, turn to your left and walk 18 paces clockwise around the "island" on the pine-covered "path" (um, don't do this within sight of the park rangers..). The box is covered with branches and debris at the bottom of a twin tree.  </p>
<p>Good luck! Hopefully kind park rangers, ponies and storms won't displace it!  </p>
