box name:  Mt. Shasta Views<br/>
nearest town: Mt. Shasta<br/>
county: Siskiyou<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:<br/>
Please check this site for avalanche/climbing information before you <br/>
attempt this box.  Chances are that it'll only be available in the <br/>
summer months (july - october), and even then, may be a dangerous climb. <br/>
  Please be careful, take water, and know your limits.<br/>
  http://www.r5.fs.fed.us/shastatrinity/mtshasta/<br/>
<br/>
You will be coming a hair's-breadth from the 10K foot marker that <br/>
separates the passless dayhikers from the $15 passholding <br/>
mountain-climbers.  (You'll be at roughly 9700 feet.  Plan for high <br/>
altitude, please.  Did I mention bringing water?  It bears mentioning <br/>
again. BRING WATER.  The sun is hot when there's little atmosphere <br/>
between you and it.)<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:<br/>
Take I-5 to the Mt. Shasta exit and go straight through town to the <br/>
Everitt Memorial Highway.  You'll be going straight up the mountain past <br/>
  Bunny Flat.<br/>
<br/>
Bunny Flat can be approached year round via the Everitt Memorial Highway <br/>
(county road A10) from the town of Mount Shasta. Sand Flat is near Bunny <br/>
Flat and is approached by a side road (41N57) from the highway.<br/>
<br/>
Continue through the Flat for another few winding miles until you get to <br/>
the parking area at the end of the road.  (If you're at Panther Meadows, <br/>
you're not far enough.  Keep going.)  Park in the lot and dodge around <br/>
all the guided climbers getting ready to go to the summit.  You can go <br/>
to the edge of the picnic area and get some great 360-degree photos of <br/>
the whole area on a clear day, too.<br/>
<br/>
At the far end of the lot is the trailhead.  If you're going to be <br/>
messing around for too long, I'd suggest paying the $15, just in case <br/>
you get above the 10K marker and need a rescue or anything.  No special <br/>
equipment beyond hiking boots and your logbook/stamp/stamp pad combo is <br/>
needed for this box, but it's still a good idea to let people know <br/>
you're going, just for safety's sake.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail up through the avalanche gulch and veer slightly to the <br/>
right to scramble over some rocks to a rather large clearing. (About 1K <br/>
feet up from the lot.)  From here, you can see another mountain in the <br/>
distance, over the Shastina saddle.  Climb further up, following the <br/>
ridge that looks like it might lead you over that saddle.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, if you keep going up along this ridge and above a snowfield, <br/>
you'll be higher than the saddle.  This is good.  You want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Take a survey of the ridge.  See how it angles up along the side of the <br/>
mountain toward the lowest (and probably snowless) rounded peak at the <br/>
closest side?  Follow the line with your eyes down from the top.  See <br/>
where it levels off after a particularly steep patch?  Go there.  It's <br/>
up a pretty steep rocky scramble.<br/>
<br/>
When you get there, sit down and enjoy the view.  It's amazing.  You're <br/>
nearly at the top of green butte, and you're almost at the 10K marker. <br/>
Look around to find three bushes that form a circle/triangle around a <br/>
boulder that's larger than all the others here.  On the far end (closest <br/>
to the ridge's dropoff, but still well within that circle and far from <br/>
the edge -- I'm a little scared of heights. :&gt;) is a hole at the base of <br/>
the boulder that's covered up with some smaller stones and some twigs. <br/>
In that hole is the box!<br/>
<br/>
If  you're having trouble, or you anticipate having some trouble with <br/>
this box location, I do have some photos available as soon as I can get <br/>
them uploaded.  Feel free to go in blind until then - the hike is well <br/>
worth it for the views alone, much less the stamp. :)<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE USE CAUTION.  During winter months, this box may be inaccessable. <br/>
  It is also an orphan -- I doubt I'll see it much.  Please email me at <br/>
gypsy@moderngypsy.com if you find it. :)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, be safe, and box on! :)<br/>
