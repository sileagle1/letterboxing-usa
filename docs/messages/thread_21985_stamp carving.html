<br/>
As an artist who work ins in multi-media, I know one trick to resolve<br/>
this, but it was shared in confidence (I think) by another carver<br/>
whose detailed carvings are legendary.  He's using something truly<br/>
unorthodox, and I'd need his permission to share one of his "trade<br/>
secrets."<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, you're looking for smaller cutting tools--art supply stores<br/>
carry them, sometimes--and also think in terms of anything else that<br/>
is very, very sharp and small.  Art-type woodworking tools may work. <br/>
Anything pointy with a channel for the discarded rubber will work.I<br/>
haven't explored the kitchen supply stores to see if they stock<br/>
anything, or scientific supply sources.  You may need to explore well<br/>
outside traditional art supplies.<br/>
<br/>
But, some rubber carvers swear by one of the penknife-style X-Acto<br/>
cutting blades.  People who become adept with them often say that<br/>
they'd never use standard block cutting tools.  (The latter are<br/>
usually my first choice.)  I've watched rubber artists work with an<br/>
X-Acto and been absolutely amazed at what they can accomplish... with<br/>
a LOT of practice.<br/>

I also have a few "handmade" cutting tools given to me by a legendary <br/>
carver whom I greatly admire and a few I have rigged up myself.  These <br/>
use very tiny cutting ends, but definitely take practice to control.<br/>

This works best if you heat the #1 blade, and pinch it with a knife <br/>
blade in the groove. The knife blade will keep the #1 from collaspsing <br/>
completely(this will seem like you need a third hand). Instead of <br/>
picking up one #1 Speedball blade you should figure on several as I <br/>

A hypodermic needle aka syringe. Your best bet would be to visit a <br/>
veterinary supply store. I suppose you could cruise some of the <br/>
seedier parts of your city and hit some flop stops, but that might be <br/>
a little dicey.<br/>
<br/>
Actually the vet. supply store would have various sizes for you to <br/>
choose from.<br/>

<br/>
It's not really the beauty of the stamp, IMHO, but the "match" to the <br/>
clue or the location, which is not always possible with bought stamps. <br/>
I have many images in my book which are just the name of the park <br/>
where the box was. That's OK; I can look at them and immediately <br/>
recall the finding of the box, and multi-colored ink pads really <br/>
dressed them up. Others were bought, but were a good match to the <br/>
location. I'm only disappointed when the stamp seems to have nothing <br/>
to do with anything.<br/>
Think "souvenir", not "masterpiece"<br/>

I think carving the stamp is half the fun of hiding a box.  But, when I <br/>
find a box with a store bought stamp, I still stamp it in my book and <br/>
am happy I found the box.  <br/>

<br/>
  Welcome to the wonderful world of Letterboxing!  If you're looking for carving materials, you may try your local Michael's or JoAnn Fabrics.  Here in CT, Michaels carries Speedy Kut and the "pink stuff".  JoAnn's carries MasterCarve.  You can also order PZ Kut from the link below.  OR you could just grab a few white erasers at Staples, WalMart, etc. and have at it!!   Please don't worry about your carving ability... even a simple stamp that someone has taken the time to carve is a wonderful thing!  Some boxers don't care to find boxes that have store bought stamps in them, and others don't mind.  If you plant the box then YOU decide what to put in it.  Most importantly... HAVE FUN!      http://www.stampeaz.com/      MayEve<br/>

<br/>
  I'm new to this hobby as well.  I LOVE hiking and finding this hobby as well as the Geocaching hobby was something that combined two things that I am passionate about....exploring the outdoors and finding lost treasure...whether it's a stamp or a trinket. lol.  <br/>
<br/>
  I'm unfortunately artisticly challenged.  I gave stamp carving a shot..cut myself with an exacto knife, ended up with an eraser that looked like it was gnawed on by an animal... and have been shy of trying to carve anything (including a bar of soap) on my own again.  No more sharp objects for me.  I really would love to try again..but only if I could find someone to show me how.  I'm not the person who can look at a diagram and call it a day.  I have to have someone sit down and actually demonstrate the technique for me to catch on...(which would be safer in my case, lol).  I'd like to learn though.  Anyone know of any classes that are available in the Pittsburgh area?<br/>

out a part of the scene. I trace or color the lines with a very soft <br/>
automatic lead pencil, turn over and rub onto eraser. I can carve <br/>
something detailed in under an hour when I have the time and I have <br/>
artist ability<br/>

&gt; Hi!, I've been letterboxing for about a month, and I am so excited<br/>
&gt; about planting a new box, but I am having a hard time finding the<br/>
stuff<br/>
&gt; to carve them out of. Where do most people buy their supplies? Also,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; am into the hunting/hiking/fun part of letterboxing, more than I<br/>
think<br/>
  &gt; I'll be on the artistic side. I don't expect any stamps I carve to <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; as beautiful as some of the ones that i've found so far. Is it<br/>
  &gt; really "looked down upon" :) to hide a box with a store bought <br/>
stamp?<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; know there aren't that many with them in it, but I'm thinking my<br/>
carved<br/>
&gt; stamps will be like a circle or square! :)<br/>

Hello Wendy.<br/>
<br/>
   I rarely use an exacto knife other than to cut off the stamp from the <br/>
main block, I use Speedball V-knives.  They work like little snow plows <br/>
on the soft material and scoot along on top of the stuff.  If you can <br/>
trace a line, you can follow a design.  A soft mechanical lead pencil <br/>
wil transfer with the rub of a finger.<br/>
<br/>

  Hi,<br/>
<br/>
   I'm new to this hobby as well.  I LOVE hiking and finding this hobby <br/>
as well<br/>
as the Geocaching hobby was something that combined two things that I <br/>
am<br/>
passionate about....exploring the outdoors and finding lost <br/>
treasure...whether<br/>
it's a stamp or a trinket. lol.<br/>
<br/>
   I'm unfortunately artisticly challenged.  I gave stamp carving a <br/>
shot..cut<br/>
myself with an exacto knife, ended up with an eraser that looked like <br/>
it was<br/>
gnawed on by an animal... and have been shy of trying to carve anything<br/>
(including a bar of soap) on my own again.  No more sharp objects for <br/>
me.  I<br/>
really would love to try again..but only if I could find someone to <br/>
show me how.<br/>
I'm not the person who can look at a diagram and call it a day.  I have <br/>
to have<br/>
someone sit down and actually demonstrate the technique for me to catch<br/>
on...(which would be safer in my case, lol).  I'd like to learn though. <br/>
 Anyone<br/>
know of any classes that are available in the Pittsburgh area?<br/>

Even if there is not a workshop at a gathering in your area, you can likely find somebody there who will take the time to talk with you or show you how they carve.<br/>

There are carving tutorials found here:<br/>

The Newboxers list is also a great place to discuss carving with others who are learning and to learn some of the ins and outs of carving:<br/>

      Stamp carving is about as easy as carving a bar of soap. The material <br/>
  lends it's self very well to carving with a grooved carving knife.<br/>
<br/>
    I have an older set of clip art programs with 100 k + of things to <br/>
  look at. Find a theme or modify the design. Some of my yet unused <br/>
  stamps are nice portraits with very little difference than the original <br/>
  with only the smallest detail being harder to copy.<br/>
<br/>
    Or pick a theme and do a Yahoo! search for it. Like "Pumpkin clip art" <br/>
  and see what turns up. Enlarge to the size you need or larger to pick <br/>
  out a part of the scene. I trace or color the lines with a very soft <br/>
  automatic lead pencil, turn over and rub onto eraser. I can carve <br/>

Maybe you want more details than a silhouette but that's what I did.  <br/>
