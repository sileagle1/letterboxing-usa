                    <div class="plaintext-content">To follow up on Funhog's comment ... surely, as a member of the <br/>
press, the author should have been more diligent in protecting the <br/>
copyrights of the authors/artists. <br/>
<br/>
They obviously knew enough to find the clues on the letterboxing dot <br/>
org site, which always contains a 'contact the placer' link to email <br/>
the creator of the box. I wonder why they didn't take advantage of <br/>
that option and chose to say something like, letterboxers are an <br/>
elusive bunch ... (another of those things that make you go hmmmmm)<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'd be very upset to find one of my boxes the subject of <br/>
such an article, and I WOULD contact the author of the piece as well <br/>
as the Editor of the paper. Not that it could do much good, but it <br/>
would make me feel better. (grin)<br/>

Enjoy!<br/>

curious if she consulted Apple Dumpling Gang and AZ Roadie regarding <br/>
