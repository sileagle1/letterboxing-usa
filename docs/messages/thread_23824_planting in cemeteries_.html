There are several boxes planted in cemetaries. There is several <br/>
folks that will tell you it is okay and several folks that will tell <br/>
you it isn't. Here is a possible solution for you . You can hide the <br/>
letterbox out and somewhat away from the actual cemetary. Use the <br/>
headstones or other written text inside the cemetary to direct folks <br/>
to your letterbox. You can use the 'Bible' code, line ,word,letter <br/>
for your clues and have folks hopping from one headstone to another. <br/>
If you need futher explanation of the line,word,letter technique you <br/>
can look at some of Green Tortuga's Town Tours or you can check out <br/>
our Seal Beach Town Tour. Using this concept you wouldn't need <br/>
permission for the actual plant and the plant wouldn't be in the <br/>
cemetary.<br/>

I think as long as you respect the people in the cemetery and remind people in your clue not to treat them with respect. Also construct clues in manners to limit stuff like walking across graves. Do things like that and a placement should be fine. <br/>
See Buried Jewells placed by C2B2 as an example. http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=17186&amp;boxname=Buried_Jewells<br/>
This is a very respectful and well placed LB that features a small cemetery. Keep in mind this is public land. Many cemeteries are not.<br/>
Last tip, make sure your hiding place is not part of a grave (i.e tombstone, mausoleum, etc). <br/>

local cemetery. I haven't placed the box there yet, but I feel its a <br/>
good idea to get permission because most sextons and maintenance <br/>
teams know every blade of grass in their charge and would probably <br/>
find out about it sooner or later. So, this particular caretaker <br/>
asked me to use my own judgement in placement, but take into account <br/>
that there are a lot of visitors and some might be particular <br/>
about "respectfulness."<br/>

&gt; &gt; We have a beautiful old cemetery that I scouted out<br/>
&gt; &gt; this week.  It is <br/>
&gt; &gt; an ideal location--one of those places one might not<br/>
&gt; &gt; 'visit' otherwise, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but well worth seeing. On the other hand, it seemed<br/>
&gt; &gt; somehow a violation <br/>
&gt; &gt; almost.  There is a locally-famous person buried<br/>
&gt; &gt; there so a small <br/>
&gt; &gt; number of people do go there for tourism.  What's<br/>
&gt; &gt; the general feel <br/>
&gt; &gt; about boxing in a cemetery?<br/>
