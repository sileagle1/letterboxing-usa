A small pen with a loop on the cap!  I can hook it to my lanyard/compass<br/>

I confiscated this pen from dh's school supplies stash.  I found<br/>
additional types at Oriental Trading when the ink runs dry.<br/>

How else is everyone organizing their gear?  I'm currently using an oversized plastic <br/>

I did start `scrapbooking' my finds to a separate log book from the one I keep in the <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have several old "personal" logbooks, and I keep them close at hand in my desk drawer. It's amazing how many times I have to go back and refer to them. I buy the same leather journal (with no lines) each time so they are kind of uniform (other than my first one), but I'm kind of anal like that. I'm curious what people do with their old filled logbooks they've removed from the boxes they've placed. I like to keep the full ones in the boxes so future finders can read through them if they like, but in some of my boxes, I've got several logbooks crammed into the boxes now, and they're beginning to fill the box up a bit too much.<br/>
I've always wondered what Gryzzled Gryphon does with all those First Finder certificates. He's probably been the FF on at least a thousand boxes in Texas.<br/>

Well, since you asked... :D<br/>
<br/>
I, too use ziplox:  my sig. stamp and pad go into a qt. ziplock which <br/>
goes into a gal. ziplock with the log; into another gal. ziplock go the <br/>
markers (a set of cheap Wallyworld, BAD imitation Marvy types and a <br/>
Crayola basic set);  a third ziplock contains basic first-aid supplies.<br/>
<br/>
This all goes into my less-than waterproof (actually sponge-like) <br/>
canvas letterboxing day pack...I've been known to 'box in the rain.<br/>
