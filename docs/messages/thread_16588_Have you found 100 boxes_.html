                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you have found 100 or 500 boxes and want to be added to a list of person's that want to receive the stamps that commemorate these milestones, send me your mailing address: DogScouts @ hotmail dot com. At this point, there will only be two lists (F-100 &amp; F-500). <br/>
<br/>
I am creating the lists for either the original stamps, or if those can't be located &amp; sent to me, I'll carve and start new stamps. First come first served, so send your address quick! If you get the box(es) and decide to hold a gathering for the people able to stamp them, that's great. <br/>
