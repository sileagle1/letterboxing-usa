This morning, Buckaroo and JLR placed two new letterboxes.  Here are
the clues, which are also posted on my website at:<br/><br/>

</a>Petticoat Hill Letterboxes
(2)<br/>
Location: Williamsburg, MA (Hampshire County)<br/>
Time: ~1.5 hours<br/>
Terrain: Steep!  <br/>
Clue Difficulty: easy to moderate<br/>
Placed on 9 March 2002 by Buckaroo and JLR<br/><br/>
Some info to know before you go:  Petticoat Hill is a short hike but
it is <b>steep</b>, and is virtually impossible in winter.  The
summit is a mere 317, but you get there <b>quickly</b>.  This hill
is named Scott Hill on USGS maps, which is confusing, because the maps
also show a Petticoat Hill.  Not the same thing, apparently!
<br/><br/>
Driving Directions: From I-91, take exit 18 (the Northampton Center exit)
and take a left off the exit ramp (theres a light here) continue on this
road (Pleasant St.) to the four-way intersection at the center of
town.  At this set of lights, take a left onto route 9 west. 
Stay on route 9 through town, and through Smith College.  Route 9
takes you all the way through Florence and Haydenville, to
Williamsburg.  Just after you pass the Williamsburg General Store on
your left, take a left onto Petticoat Hill Road.  The parking area
(big enough for two cars) is just up the hill on your left.<br/><br/>
 Walk: Climb towards the summit!  Follow the white
blazes.  A stone wall crosses the trail.  From here, count
right-hand white blazes.  At the fourth, take 9 paces and look left
to a small patch of boulders.  Turn to the boulders and take 9 more
paces.  Look under the tabletop boulder to find the <b>Lost
Hat</b>.  Now, you may continue a little further uphill to explore
the summit, or retreat back down to find the second letterbox.  When
coming down the hill, look again for the stone wall.  It will tell
you where to turn right and follow the other half of the loop
trail.  On your way down, find a tree pointing its roots
uphill.  Walk to the part of this tree that used to be the highest,
and look left.  Walk off the trail and check amongst the boulders to
find the <b>Lost Mitten</b>.  Continue downhill to complete the loop
trail.  Well done!<br/>
