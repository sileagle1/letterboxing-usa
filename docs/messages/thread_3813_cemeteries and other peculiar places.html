 I have found only one cemetery box. It is actually<br/>
found by following one of the Woodstock, VT Quests.<br/>
It's in a very interesting place (not tucked under a<br/>
tombstone or buried in the ground, mind you)and is a<br/>
very interesting box indeed. Placed mostly by<br/>
schoolkids, the Vermont Quests are most excellent<br/>
finds for letterboxers both young and old... and you<br/>
get to visit some really cool places too! Visit the<br/>
ValleyQuest site and you can send for the newly bound<br/>
book (quite impressive now as our friend Sarah Fearing<br/>
has one!)No, this isn't an advertisement... just a<br/>
friendly note to letterboxers.<br/>
At any rate, y'all take care... hope to see lots of<br/>
stamps out there!<br/>

A good number of the ValleyQuest boxes are in cemeteries (most<br/>
recently, I did Woodstock, VT, Lebanon, NH, and Grantham, NH).  I've<br/>
actually enjoyed it since it's led me to a lot of nice out-of-the-way<br/>
cemeteries that I might not have found otherwise.<br/>
