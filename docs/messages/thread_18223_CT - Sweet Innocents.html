                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you Cat lover / gardener / teacher for the report of the missing box. We were able to get out to "Sweet Innocents" last night. You had reported the 2nd box "Passion" missing. We went to see if we could find her. We went down the trail another 100 feet and turned back in dismay that we could not find her. On our way back Madam Lady Bug spotted her under a rock on the same side of the trail. It had a large hole in the large outer zip lock bag. Maybe some animal thought the mayo jar was still full and they needed it in their frig??? Anyways it has been replaced and a couple of rocks put there to help hold it down. Thank you for the heads up. Now both of Sweet Innocents are back in action with a very, very wet trail.<br/>
