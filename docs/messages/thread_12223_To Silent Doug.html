Hello Silent Doug, <br/>
<br/>
Went with MjLikePInk to check on the Fishers of Men letterbox in Illinois. <br/>
Though we have checked on it many times we just realized that the stamp is <br/>
missing! It was last seen by Show-Me-the-Cache back in AUg of 2001 so it must <br/>
have gone missing after that.<br/>
it was a green foam fish. Could you pretty please send us a note as to <br/>
whether or not you saw it when you visited the cache?  WE saw your wonderful <br/>
personal stamp in the log book.<br/>
<br/>
We would really like to have it back since it was the very first that we <br/>
carved....<br/>
I'm afraid someone picked up as part of the geocache even though it was <br/>
clearly marked.  Last year I  encountered a few malicious geocachers who <br/>
actually trashed a few of our boxes but I', hoping that the stamp is just out <br/>
there somewhere.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
 I'd really appreciate the help. <br/>
<br/>

Yes, I remember the stamp, so it was definitely there when on February 3rd <br/>
when I visited. (I also just logged the find on geocaching.com, don't know <br/>
how I missed adding my log there.) It doesn't look like there have been too <br/>
many geocachers since then, so maybe you can figure out who mistakenly took <br/>
it. Sorry to hear it's gone....<br/>
