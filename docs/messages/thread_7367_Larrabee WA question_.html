Is Amanda's Fragrance Lake box missing?  (I noticed these clues said 3 <br/>
instead of 4 boxes up there...)  Just wondering, since I wanted to point a <br/>
friend of mine in that direction for a hike and I'd rather let her know <br/>
ahead of time if one of 'em is gone. :)<br/>

ahead and go for it!  The clues were entered seperately. (I planted <br/>
Frangrance Lake almost a year after the other 3 boxes!) <br/>

PS. Fragrance Lake is also a better stamp, since I improved as a <br/>
carver!!<br/>
