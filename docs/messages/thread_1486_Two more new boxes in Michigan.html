Directions: Presque Isle is located in the City of Marquette in the Upper<br/>
Peninsula of Michigan. It is a 323 acre park located along the shores of<br/>
Lake Superior and is easily found once you reach the city.<br/>
There are numerous signs and any of the local people can give you<br/>
directions.<br/>
    Be prepared to walk and be sure to have a camera with you as you will<br/>
have some terrific photo opportunities. Watch for changes in the  weather.<br/>
Because of the lake the temperatures can change considerably from one area<br/>
of the park to another.<br/>
    The walking trails are really very good, and watch for the deer. They<br/>
are quite used to people because of the heavey use of the park. But rember<br/>
they are still wwild animals and to be respected. On the day we planted the<br/>
boxes we were lucky enough to see and photograph the albino deer that<br/>
resides in the park.<br/>
    Near the lake shore be extra careful. If you have children with ou watch<br/>
them closely along the edge and on the rocks. It is beautiful along this<br/>
rugged shore and we urge you to enjoy, but with care!!!!<br/>
    If you bring a dog with you, the pet must remain in your vehicle. A city<br/>
ordinance prohibits the walking of dogs at Presque Isle, even if they are on<br/>
leashes.<br/>
    There is a loop road that circles around the perimiter of the park and<br/>
we recommend a drive around once to get an idea of the size and locations in<br/>
the park.<br/>
Clues: Presque Isle #1<br/>
    Watch for the Presque Isle Nature Trail sign, on the left, at the top of<br/>
the first hill and find a near by  parking area. Start at the sign and<br/>
follow the path in a northerly direction. Not far in you will find a fork in<br/>
the trail. Take either of the paths as they will intersect further down the<br/>
trail. At this second intersection start watching for a cut stump directly<br/>
on the right edge of the pathway. From this stump continue on the path for<br/>
24 steps. Turn 1/4 turnturn to your right, 150 degrees ( magnetic ) if you<br/>
have a compass, and go 15 steps to an X formed by two fallen trees. The X<br/>
marks the spot!<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Presque Isle #2<br/>
    Starting back at the Presque Isle sign, the one with the Indian in the<br/>
canoe, near the entrance to the park, go approximately 1.2 miles on the road<br/>
around the park. You will find a parking area tothe right with an entrance<br/>
that almost doubles back along the road. Park here and take the path to the<br/>
lake that is closest to the hill on your right. Follow this path to the<br/>
right to the first first path to the right going toward the hill. Take this<br/>
path into a "bowl shaped depression. Look ahead of you and located a white<br/>
birch tree with another birch about 10 feet behind the first. The base of<br/>
the rock wall behind them is where you will want to look for the box.<br/>
Good Luck !        The Yoopers<br/>
