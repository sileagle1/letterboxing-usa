religious-themed boxes, why not other human issues?  It's my personal<br/>
belief that if you have a thought to share, share it. Those who are<br/>

one is being forced to find boxes (at least we hope not).<br/>
<br/>
Now, workers rights are something dear to our hearts. We've put out a<br/>
box or two with that in mind, especially the history of the labor<br/>
movement. Now, we think everyone should know that a hundred-ish years<br/>
ago, ordinary people worked 10-14 hour days, 6 days a week, and didn't<br/>
make enough in wages to feed their families. How far we've come, but<br/>
how?  The controversial part of this is that there are STILL employers<br/>
who exploit workers. Some people think that trade unions' days are<br/>
long gone. (I know better).<br/>

  I am a no rules advocate when it comes to letterboxing. I say if thats what you really want to do, make the box. With the popularity of letterboxing increasing, political boxes and controversial boxes are inevitable. I'm waiting to see what happens when the boxes pop up with very unpopular, far out fringe views. It will happen sooner or later. Will we still think it is ok?
