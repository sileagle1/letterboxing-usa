                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, We just started letterboxing today.  Traveled about an hour from<br/>
home to search for the Big Dipper Letterbox in Sherburne, NY.  Does any<br/>
one know if it still exists - or did it get washed away with our record<br/>
snow fall this year.  It was a pleasant visit anyway with Canada Geese<br/>
coming in for the evening and we made it back to the car before the rain<br/>
started.<br/>

This box I placed when travelling in the area a couple years ago I <br/>
think it had visitors last fall that mentioned it here.  I do have a <br/>
friend in the area who might check on it for me she went with me when <br/>
I placed it. I'll see what we can do.   Anyone else found big Dipper? <br/>
When?  Thnks Chris and Kate for bringing tit to our attention. I hope <br/>
it was just a mix up in the clue or a change in the trail that  made <br/>
it hard to find and not that it is gone.  Leader of the Pack in <br/>

Maybe we'll give it another try  - when the water subsides. <bg><br/>
