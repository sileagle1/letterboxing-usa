Gosh, Randy, I would be more than happy to give you my inexpert <br/>
opinion of the locales you used for your boxes.  Just send lots of <br/>
hints (or the decoded clues) and I will get right on it. ;o)<br/>

Well, I always drop hints in person ... Meet me for the unofficial<br/>
gathering of 1 (or 2) in Montpelier Sept 21st :-)  <br/>
<br/>
(and of course the "stories" post was full of hints for those who <br/>
read the stories)<br/>
<br/>
I have a new box.  This one is easy.  No LNT issues, no container<br/>
issues, I never have to check if its gone missing, but I haven't <br/>
had time to write it up to to (feebly) trying to deal with this <br/>
mess without turning on moderation.<br/>
<br/>
(this is to answer my critics (and I do have critics) who say my clues<br/>
are too long):<br/>
<br/>
This box is always with me when I do something letterboxing related.  <br/>
So you just have to find me to stamp in.  On the trail, at a gathering.<br/>
Its sort of like a Traveler (which is different from a hitchhiker), but <br/>
its a full box, not just a stamp.  Happy hunting ...<br/>
<br/>
So, there you go.  I'll put in on my web site in a few days.  I don't<br/>
expect too many people to look for this one either ... :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
