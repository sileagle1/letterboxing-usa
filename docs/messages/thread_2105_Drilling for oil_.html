                    <html><body>Hi - I just wanted to let you know that I took a new group letterboxing in 
<br/>Wheaton Regional Park yesterday.  Everyone had a wonderful time.  They are 
<br/>all excited about the sport and want to plant there own letterboxes in their 
<br/>favorite places.  The third letterbox was not to be found - you said it was 
<br/>missing - so we put a starter kit in its' place.  We didn't have an extra 
<br/>container to put it in so it is just in a plastic bag.  I just wanted to let 
<br/>you know.  Thanks for all your wonderful clues.
