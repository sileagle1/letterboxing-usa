                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last Friday night suspicious baggage and a security breach closed down<br/>
two concourses at LAX. As a result, my connecting flight in Denver was<br/>
grounded in LA. Rather than hang out in the airport for a predicted<br/>
three more hours (not fun,) I opted to spend the night in Denver,<br/>
rebook for Saturday and go letterboxing (decidedly fun.) <br/>
<br/>
In the process, I got to check on the two orphaned boxes that I left<br/>
behind last year. Happily, both Raincloud and Shining Star are doing<br/>
just fine. Nary a single letterboxer had emailed me about finding the<br/>
latter. So I had no idea if anyone had ever been there or if it had<br/>
gone missing. I was pleased to see that several folks had been to this<br/>
little box at 10,000 feet. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you TSA for sending me on an uplanned hike high in the Rocky<br/>
Mountains! Funhog<br/>
