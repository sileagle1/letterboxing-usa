Trailside one's a bit tricky at the moment -- the Susan B Anthony Sycamore has been <br/>
cut off about 4' up and there's no dedication sign anymore... We did not find <br/>
franzsolo's Mystery Hiker 2002.<br/>

Good luck! Lovely place but the bug spray is definitely a must-have!<br/>

when and where do you want to meet? maybe we should exchange info <br/>

the wrong entrance.<br/>

We lost the lid to one of the micro boxes. Mudd Puppy dropped it, <br/>
and we couldn't find it in the underbrush. Would you mind <br/>
carrying an extra film canister lid with you in case you encounter <br/>
that box? I would really appreciate it!<br/>

Never did find that stupid thing...<br/>
