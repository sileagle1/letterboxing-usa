I suspect MapSurfer holds a record for this, though I couldn't tell<br/>
you which of his boxes are likely winners.<br/>

doubt anyone will even try to find it for another three plus years.  =)<br/>

Well, it's never been reported as missing, so I consider that a good<br/>
sign.  =)  I'm FAR more likely to hear from people when my box is<br/>
missing than when it's actually there!<br/>

We hid a box in North Dakota around the same time.  Almost as <br/>
remote as Zimbabwe.  No one has reported either way on that <br/>
one.<br/>

sounds like a challenge! Too bad it's snowing right now. Come spring <br/>
time I think I'll have to put the Hidden Pond LB at the top of my <br/>
have-to-find list. Then again, this time of year I don't have to <br/>
worry about bears like some of your other what-a-hike-that-was <br/>
letterboxes. <br/>
