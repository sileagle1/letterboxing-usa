Luckily it was there only moved a bit. I returned it to it's original <br/>
spot and added a new ink pad. It had  seen some company through fall <br/>
and I had been told someone  had been there just 2 weeks previous. It <br/>
is in an infamous party park so the spot is more difficult than some. <br/>
It is well tucked away.  <br/>
   Planning a new  set of boxes for over the Thanksgiving break hope <br/>
the weather wants to cooperate. Keep your eye  out for the clues. I <br/>
may  get them out in the afternoon on Thanksgiving as we eat dinner <br/>
at 12 so  there is plenty of light left.  After  dinner a walk is <br/>
always great and these trails are so close to home.  Since we are <br/>
farmers my husband and my daughters will be gone to the barn . ( <br/>
allergies keep me away) So we will  venture out  unless heavy rain <br/>
comes.  Hope everyone has a great holiday, be Safe!    <br/>
