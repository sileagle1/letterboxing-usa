You need to only bring yourself and a covered dish of some kind. Nothing<br/>
else is required, though anything else is greatly appreciated.  Bring your<br/>
current personal stamp for exchanges, but nothing else is needed. If you<br/>
want to carve a new traveler, by all means, dive in, the more stamps the<br/>
merrier I say.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what we of Team Rayvenhaus are doing, other than the food and the<br/>
fellowship, is....<br/>
<br/>
We are carving a new 'Themed' series to be placed for that day, with a<br/>
bonus. Find all of the hidden ones and show proof and there's a double<br/>
secret probation letterbox that you'll be privy to.  We are also taking<br/>
boxes that others from around the country in the letterbox community want to<br/>
create and send along and placing them in the area as well.  We are carving<br/>
a new Hitchhiker to release that day AND have carved a new sig stamp for<br/>
Rayvenhaus which is, in my opinion, just too funny and fitting for this<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if there are any other activities that anyone else thinks might be a<br/>
great idea, please don't hesitate to let us know now so we can coordinate<br/>
them.  We'd be happen to add anything that we can to this gathering to make<br/>
it more fun for all.<br/>
<br/>
Please, if you have ideas, drop us a line off list and let us know.<br/>

&gt; Since this will be our first gathering can you all tell me what to expect<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; what I need to do besides the food.  Do I make a travelor and carve a<br/>
stamp<br/>
&gt; to bring?  On travelors, how do you find out what to ask people to get the<br/>
&gt; stamp from them?  Is there a place to post those questions?  I want to<br/>
make sure I<br/>
&gt; do not forget to bring anything so we can join in all of the activities.<br/>
&gt; Campfire Lady and I just could not wait to cancel our event and<br/>
re-schedule it<br/>
&gt; so that we can come to this event.  Thanks to you all.  Willow and kids.<br/>
