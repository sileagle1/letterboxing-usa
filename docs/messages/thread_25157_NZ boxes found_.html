<br/>
Almost exactly 2 years ago we spent 3 weeks vacationing in New Zealand.  While we were there we planted 2 boxes on the South Island and 3 on the North Island.  All had a Maori theme. The NI boxes were found after 1 year and now the SI boxes have been found after 2 years.  It was nice to hear that they are still in good shape.  I think each box has only had one visitor - 55 Steps (of NZ) at 4 of the boxes and Norfolk Nomads (from Norfolk, MA USA) at 1 box.<br/>
<br/>
No, these were not tricky, mystery clues.  NZ is just not a hot bed of LB activity.  However if any of you head over that way, there ARE a few boxes scattered around, most planted by people from the USA.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for visiting and for placing boxes for us to find! No, we're not a hot-bed down here yet, but we do have more than a few boxes to find - probably around 150. <br/>
<br/>
The most definitive list can be found at<br/>
http://www.psychokiwi.org/letterboxing/nzboxing.htm<br/>
but is not always the most up-to-date. AtlasQuest also has over 95% of the boxes listed, and you can use the journey planner features if you're on a road trip as all the main highways are listed. <br/>
