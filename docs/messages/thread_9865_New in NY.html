Subject:  Letterbox clues<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, I think I submitted the clues to my first letterbox, but I'm not sure <br/>
if<br/>
it made it to your talk list, I am having computer issues...<br/>
Well, just incase it didn't, here it is again ( I updated a few things)<br/>
<br/>
Salem's Fairytale Letterbox<br/>
Salem, NY<br/>
Planted 12/27/02<br/>
by TracerRound of the "Camo Connection"<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time in a town, no a village called Salem this letterboxing<br/>
adventure began. A new letterboxer named Tracer Round set out to make a<br/>
letterbox all her own. Where to begin she wondered, then she remembered a very<br/>
creative letterbox she found placed by the Porch Otters in Olney, Maryland. <br/>
Yes, thats where the inspiration would come from. An ink pad and a stamp would<br/>
be a great place to start. "I won't be needing a box for this one!" she<br/>
exclaimed, but "oh, this will do." With everything in place, this new<br/>
letterbox needed a home. So it wouldn't be lonely she decided to put it with<br/>
others that appeared to be its own kind. Tracer Round was also very protective<br/>
of her new letterbox and didn't want it to get wet, dirty, or blown away by <br/>
the<br/>
wind. Now is the time for drawing up some clues, a sort of treasure hunt so<br/>
others could find it. She thought a good place to start would be to research a<br/>
biography of a famous letterboxer. She didn't want future letterboxers to have<br/>
to go 92 steps or anything like that, this letterbox would be different. She<br/>
also decided to keep the "gatekeeper" out of the loop so letterboxers couldn't<br/>
ask her for help. You will find what you seek by following this story and all<br/>
will live happily ever after...<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
Tracer Round<br/>
...please email me at TracerRound_CC@hotmail.com if you have any questions or<br/>
comments and to let me know the condition of my "box", thanks...<br/>
