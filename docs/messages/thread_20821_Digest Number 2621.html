Don't  get me wrong:  GPS can be quite handy devices, especially useful when  <br/>
hiking, fishing, driving, etc.  I just appreciate the simplicity of the  <br/>
compass which relies upon the earth, not batteries.  No amount of  precision in <br/>
tools can account for problems in clues, location, or outside  factors.  <br/>

This is exactly why I chose letterboxing over geocaching. Geocaching  peaked <br/>
my interest a lot but the GPS always had me second guessing it....  through <br/>
researching geocaching more I found letterboxing and knew immediately it  was <br/>
right for me... it only took me 6 months to put it all in play but I love  <br/>
letterboxing and am quickly hooked... I just wish I could get out more then a  <br/>
couple/few times a month :::sigh:::<br/>
