                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've only been letterboxing since June, and joined this list fairly <br/>
recently.  It has been very interesting.  I'm forming my own <br/>
opinions - which will remain my own - on stamps, clues, etc.  I'm in <br/>
this hobby/game/addiction (whatever) - to have a great time.  <br/>
I figure as long as we follow the general rules of letterboxing, <br/>
such as respect for the environment, proper care and re-hiding of <br/>
other people's boxes, stealth, etc. - we shouldn't expect everyone <br/>
else to conform to our ideas, whatever they are.  Variety is the <br/>
spice of life and probably we don't all like the same spices.  <br/>
But that's NOT what this post is all about, so PLEASE don't start on <br/>
it.<br/>
My personal pet peeve, which includes all lists and not just this <br/>
one, is the constant inclusion of large parts of previous postings <br/>
in the replies.  By the time I reach the bottom of some lists I'm <br/>
experiencing overload.  <br/>
If you want to read the entire thread over and over, it's much <br/>
easier just to go to http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-<br/>
usa/messages and read them as many times as you like. I think I may <br/>
start doing that instead of reading as e-mail.<br/>
Just a suggestion.  I'm not making any further remarks on this.  It <br/>
is, after all, only my personal opinion - and I'm sticking to it.<br/>

Good luck with that one.  Most people top quote, and, unfortately,<br/>
that will never change, despite, as you point out, the absurdity<br/>
of it.<br/>
