                    <div class="plaintext-content">After 4 long months of recovering, Gingerbread Jim has been released <br/>
from the hospital. As some of you may know, back this winter, he had <br/>
been kidnapped and held against his will in the cold outdoors. When he <br/>
was found by The Ryan Family in January, he had been suffering from <br/>
Hypothermia and mal-nutritian.<br/>
<br/>
The trial for the kidnapper will be held sometime within the next few <br/>
months at a local courthouse here in New Hampshire. Until then, the <br/>
kidnapper will be held without bail. When the trail begins, your <br/>
support would be appreciated.<br/>
