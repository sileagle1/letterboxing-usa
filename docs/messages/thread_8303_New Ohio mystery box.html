website.Thanks!  TITLE: "You take the high road, I'll take the low <br/>
road". This is a new mystery box placed somewhere in Ohio on 10-8-<br/>
02,by Salamander.Difficulty:Moderate; some walking up/down grassy <br/>
slope.NOTE: Please bring a stamp pad.  CLUES: You will go to the city <br/>
which served as Ohio's first capital.Then find the street which is <br/>
mentioned above(yes, it is mentioned up there somewhere).Find a place <br/>
where a chestnut crosses. Then go 2 blocks east.Go behind the "Y".<br/>
(You may have driven a vehicle up to this point, but you will need to <br/>
finish your journey on foot from here on out.) You should see a <br/>
picturesque bridge over a body of water. Cross this bridge, then <br/>
proceed south down the sidewalk, in what would be a clockwise <br/>
direction around the body of water. Very shortly you will see 3 large <br/>
bald cypress trees to your right.Stop on the sidewalk in front of the <br/>
third tree. Then go 84 paces at a heading of 45 degrees (1 pace=2 <br/>
steps).You should now be in front of a memorial to a certain group of <br/>
this city's public servants. Immediately to the northeast of the <br/>
small tree behind the monument, take a reading of 60 degrees and go <br/>
81 paces to a Hackberry tree. You will need to cross a well-travelled <br/>
road,so please be very cautious of traffic. Stand at the east side of <br/>
the tree and take a reading of 82 degrees.Walk until you reach a <br/>
square brick building bearing a bronze plaque containing the <br/>
word "corps", among others. Step to the right until you can see 3 <br/>
brownish cylindrical objects which appear to be atop the slope behind <br/>
the building. That is where you need to go. I strongly suggest using <br/>
the wooden stairs which are visible to your left (North/Northwest) <br/>
then walking back atop the slope. Stand on the walkway in front of <br/>
the middle cylinder and take 16 paces down the walkway, heading <br/>
southeast. Stop. From this spot go straight down the grassy slope to <br/>
the edge of the rocks. What you seek is there at your  feet, between <br/>
3 large rocks with 2 smaller rocks resting on top. While this is not <br/>
the most scenic spot in the area, I hope you have seen much beauty <br/>
along the way, and remember that beauty is where you find it.<br/>
