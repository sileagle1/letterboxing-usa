                    <div class="plaintext-content">I took the bull by the horns and went to Mansfield today. Mansfield is<br/>
very intimidating to someone as unorganized and scatter brained and your<br/>
truly. I usually end up driving around and around, getting very few of<br/>
the treasures, but today I went straight to the historical society<br/>
building and successfully found The Rock Climber, The Vermont Quarter (my<br/>
first quarter), Inherit the Earth, Bed Bug and Plane Spotter. All were<br/>
wonderful and in good shape except Inherit the Earth needed, new baggies<br/>
and a drying out. It's in fine shape now and I put it in a freezer bag as<br/>
an extra precaution.<br/>
                                   thanks all<br/>
