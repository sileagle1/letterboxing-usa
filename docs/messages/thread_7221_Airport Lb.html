Maybe we need a list of letterboxes that are referenced by the airport <br/>

Hi guys ,   sorry that your merit badges have not arrived yet.   I have run <br/>
into a little problem.  I expected Town Hall to mail them to you directly but <br/>
they didn't and mailed them to me ....I just received them late last week.<br/>
<br/>
Which was really a small blessing.<br/>
<br/>
That is when I realized there was a typ0.  All of the X25's were printed as <br/>
X75's.  I am sorry.  I called and Andrea said she will send the corrected <br/>
merit badges to me right away.  I am hoping to have them by next Wednesday <br/>
and then I will send your orders right out.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry this has taken so long.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to respnd and vent.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,  Kay "Mohmers"<br/>

Subject: town Hall problem<br/>
<br/>
HI Mary,  I wasn't aware all of this had gone on.  I indeed did get <br/>
permission to put TownHall's name on the website.  I am not sure who you <br/>
talked to and am sorry for the bother and additional expense of the closed <br/>
account.  I wish you had sent a note to me ...maybe I could have straightened <br/>
things out.<br/>
  I just spoke to TownHall last week and received NO indication that there <br/>
was any problem at all.  I will call them again today to to clear the air.<br/>
<br/>
Once again I am very sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Mohmers<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, let me add my 2 cents here:<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to order this way, make sure that you are willing to wait up<br/>
to several months for your check to clear, or use a money order.<br/>
<br/>
I had closed my account in July after a long time of no activity and before<br/>
Town Hall sent the patches or cashed the check. And although the closed<br/>
account should have just bounced the check back to Town Hall, and I could<br/>
have sent them a replacement check, the check forced my count to reopen and<br/>
overdraw (because the bank hadn't teller hadn't properly closed the account,<br/>
I was told the first time).  The check was for $10.75 and was written in<br/>
April.<br/>
<br/>
More interessting than that was I had tried to call Town Hall Embroidery and<br/>
the local operator said there was no such listing. However, they are<br/>
apparently listed as Town Hall Archery, and answer the phone as Town Hall<br/>
Sports.  I had left a detailed message on their answering machine about the<br/>
check the very day I had found out what had happened. No one bothered to<br/>
call me back.  I thought I must have had the wrong number, but I emailed<br/>
mohmers and I had been right, so I called again.<br/>
<br/>
This is where it starts to get interesting. I called back during business<br/>
hours and was put through to a woman who was very rude, terse, and<br/>
uncooperative, who claimed that they don't do patches for people, that she<br/>
had already complained and asked that her company name "be taken off that<br/>
internet thing" *last year* and still people are sending checks. And she<br/>
said that she wasn't even sure who it was in her company that was telling<br/>
people to order this way, but she was pretty sure it was a friend of one of<br/>
the workers there, but someone outside the company, still having people<br/>
order this way. She railed on about how she nor anyone else there has the<br/>
time to deal with this, that they only do large wholesale bulk patches.<br/>
Furthermore, she said she didn't want checks from anyone coming there unless<br/>
it was one check for the whole order.  She also claimed that she ended up<br/>
paying postage on these small orders because people don't send the right<br/>
amount, but I told her that I had put much more postage on the return<br/>
envelope than was required. She said she would not send back the check for a<br/>
replacement, and when I asked if I could just speak to whoever sends their<br/>
checks to the bank, she refused, again saying that she had no time for any<br/>
of this and wasn't about to walk down to another part of the building<br/>
because she had work to do.  Well, you can imagine my frustration. I was as<br/>
nice as I could be and pointed out that resending the check might reopen the<br/>
account and bounce again, causing me more problems, and her company would<br/>
still not get paid.  I wanted to send a replacement check from my new bank<br/>
but I needed the old check.  In the end, she agreed to take down my name and<br/>
phone number and put it on the desk of "the girl I think whose friend it is<br/>
that has people ordering these." Naturally, I never heard a word. What they<br/>
did was resubmit the check. And although my bank had assured me that one<br/>
check would not, could not, reopen the account, it did.  I just got another<br/>
month's statement with the overdraft and associated fees.  And no one at my<br/>
old bank has been able to tell me how this is happening (through the magic<br/>
of computers and their automated system, they think).<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the woman I spoke to, who would not tell me her name,<br/>
was completely in a headspin over the patch orders or because someone hadn't<br/>
gotten permission to take the orders this way and was taking it out on me.<br/>
So, just be aware that whoever it is at Town Hall who supposedly does this<br/>
has created some rift within her company, and they *don't* return calls, at<br/>
least long distance ones.  Unless Mohmers is going to see through the patch<br/>
ordering, I'd be very leery of doing business with that place.<br/>

Subject: TOWN HALL CORRECTION: Patches<br/>
<br/>
Hi again everyone.   sorry about the patch confusion.<br/>
<br/>
I just spoke with Andrea at Town Hall Embroidery (really the embroidery shop <br/>
in Town Hall Archery).<br/>
<br/>
She was very nice.  She said she would NOT like to take individual orders for <br/>
the LBNA patches anymore.  The one time was way too hectic and too much <br/>
trouble to keep track of.  <br/>
<br/>
Please send your orders for the LBNA logo patches directly to me UNLESS you <br/>
would like to order 50 yourself ....you are welcome to that as often as you <br/>
wish.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for any confusion that has been caused ... everyone has a bad day, <br/>
especially when you are working in retail.   :o)<br/>
<br/>
The merit badge orders and the decal orders should be sent directly to the <br/>
distributors.  <br/>
<br/>
Please go to this site before making any orders:   <a href="http://hometown.aol.com/mohmers/myhomepage/business.html">LbNA regalia updates</a> <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
:o)<br/>

Hi SHeila,  Andrea didn't mention having recieved an order... she said that <br/>
she would contact me if she received any individual orders though.    I will <br/>
call and check on it with her ... it may be she put it in the file and forgot <br/>
about it during our conversation.<br/>
<br/>
It will be a while before we have the minimum of 50 patches .... I'll let you <br/>
know what goes on.<br/>

Thanks =)))<br/>

  Hi SHeila,  Andrea didn't mention having recieved an order... she said that she would contact me if she received any individual orders though.    I will call and check on it with her ... it may be she put it in the file and forgot about it during our conversation.<br/>
<br/>
  It will be a while before we have the minimum of 50 patches .... I'll let you know what goes on.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks, Kay "Mohmers" <br/>

&gt; Hi again everyone.   sorry about the<br/>
&gt; patch confusion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just spoke with Andrea at Town Hall<br/>
&gt; Embroidery (really the embroidery shop in Town<br/>
&gt; Hall Archery).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She was very nice.  She said she would NOT<br/>
&gt; like to take individual orders for the LBNA<br/>
&gt; patches anymore.  The one time was way too<br/>
&gt; hectic and too much trouble to keep track<br/>
&gt; of.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please send your orders for the LBNA logo<br/>
&gt; patches directly to me UNLESS you would like to<br/>
&gt; order 50 yourself ....you are welcome to that<br/>
&gt; as often as you wish.  :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry for any confusion that has been caused<br/>
&gt; ... everyone has a bad day, especially when you<br/>
&gt; are working in retail.   :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The merit badge orders and the decal orders<br/>
&gt; should be sent directly to the<br/>
&gt; distributors.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please go to this site before making any<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Kay,<br/>
<br/>
Well, I certainly don't blame you for my experience, so there is no need to apologize.  As I said, I sensed that this woman was frazzled and chose to take it all on me.  I had emailed you in July when the problem first was apparent and you sent me their number, and thanked me for trying to straighten it out.  I don't know if having you call them would have made any difference; it may have.  I'm glad your contacts there have not been as rude to you as mine.  I think it's better that you are going to handle things for the group from this point on.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, please let me know if you can figure out what is going on with that check.  I just want it back so I can send them a new one.  AFAIK, my bank never paid it.  But that bank is very confused these days... and so am I, in turn.  :-P  I certainly wouldn't want this mix-up to hamper anyone else's order from LbNA.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
Mary (RI)<br/>

  HI Mary,  I wasn't aware all of this had gone on.  I indeed did get permission to put TownHall's name on the website.  I am not sure who you talked to and am sorry for the bother and additional expense of the closed account.  I wish you had sent a note to me ...maybe I could have straightened things out.<br/>
    I just spoke to TownHall last week and received NO indication that there was any problem at all.  I will call them again today to to clear the air.<br/>
<br/>
  Once again I am very sorry.<br/>

Hello there,<br/>
Ryan Carpenter and I hunted for the Stinky Marsh Crab box in Alameda, <br/>
CA on Monday and we could not find it.  (And the area was very stinky <br/>
and marshy!) :-P<br/>
<br/>
But the week prior, we had great success finding the Uva's Canyon box <br/>
in Morgan Hill!  You win some, you lose some.<br/>

  Hi guys ,   sorry that your merit badges have not arrived yet.   I have run into a little problem.  I expected Town Hall to mail them to you directly but they didn't and mailed them to me ....I just received them late last week.<br/>
<br/>
  Which was really a small blessing.<br/>
<br/>
  That is when I realized there was a typ0.  All of the X25's were printed as X75's.  I am sorry.  I called and Andrea said she will send the corrected merit badges to me right away.  I am hoping to have them by next Wednesday and then I will send your orders right out.<br/>
<br/>
  I am sorry this has taken so long.<br/>
<br/>
  Please feel free to respnd and vent.  :o)<br/>

It looked as though a critter of the four legged kind  had opened the box and drug out the contents. The stamp even has one end chewed off.  We did out best to put things back together and rehide it, but you may want to make some repairs.<br/>
<br/>
    On a side note.... the clues say the bridge is to the right in your Big Bone Lick series, as well as part of your Sith series..... when actually the bridge is to the right.<br/>
<br/>
    All the best and thanks for some great plants!<br/>

&gt; Hi again everyone.   sorry about the patch confusion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just spoke with Andrea at Town Hall Embroidery (really the <br/>
embroidery shop <br/>
&gt; in Town Hall Archery).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She was very nice.  She said she would NOT like to take individual <br/>
orders for <br/>
&gt; the LBNA patches anymore.  The one time was way too hectic and too <br/>
much <br/>
&gt; trouble to keep track of.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please send your orders for the LBNA logo patches directly to me <br/>
UNLESS you <br/>
&gt; would like to order 50 yourself ....you are welcome to that as <br/>
often as you <br/>
&gt; wish.  :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry for any confusion that has been caused ... everyone has a bad <br/>
day, <br/>
&gt; especially when you are working in retail.   :o)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The merit badge orders and the decal orders should be sent directly <br/>
to the <br/>
&gt; distributors.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please go to this site before making any orders:   <a <br="">
HREF="http://hometown.aol.com/mohmers/myhomepage/business.html"&gt;LbNA <br/>

Fish Head and Fish Tail<br/>
Planted 8/28/02<br/>
By Amanda from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
These stamps are two parts to a whole.  You have the Fish Head and <br/>
the Fish Tail and you have to find both of them to put them together <br/>
and form the whole Fish! :-)<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
He may have been foolhardy when he made a large purchase of land to <br/>
the north, but it was no folly to name this park after him! <br/>
<br/>
 Take the road towards the amphitheater and park at the pavilions <br/>
before the Fish Hatchery.  Take the road (no vehicles allowed) down <br/>
to the Lake.  At the Lake, turn to the left and walk until you reach <br/>
a small building.  Climb the first set of stairs on your left. At the <br/>
fork go right past the white house and chain link fence. When you <br/>
reach an intersection with a gravel path there will be a bench and a <br/>
sign board. Go left on the gravel path for approximately 95 steps. On <br/>
your right will be a short path to a large tree. To the left of the <br/>
tree is a small thick hollow log.  The Fish Head Letterbox is in this <br/>
log covered by loose bark and debris.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the gravel path and take a right just before you reach <br/>
the road (taking a left down the road would return you to your car). <br/>
But you take the right just before the road and at the fork go left. <br/>
Go over 3 boardwalks and the first cedar tree you see on your right <br/>
has the Fish Tail Letterbox in a crevice at its base. (in the rear of <br/>
the tree and covered by cedar needles and debris).<br/>
<br/>
You can backtrack to the gravel path and take a left on the road to <br/>
your car or continue on this path to the picnic area and then <br/>
backtrack left along the road to your car.<br/>
<br/>
Beware of Poison Oak! (at this park, they have kindly labeled most of <br/>
the poison oak areas with signs! Danger! :-)<br/>
As always, please be discreet.  <br/>
Use caution when reaching into crevices and dark places.<br/>
Also, read the waiver of responsibility and disclaimer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Amanda from Seattle<br/>

Monday was a hot day, so maybe that stinky marsh crab went down to <br/>
the bay for a swim. I will check it out. Hope he is still hidden in <br/>
the licorice plants. <br/>

&gt; Hello there,<br/>
&gt; Ryan Carpenter and I hunted for the Stinky Marsh Crab box in <br/>
Alameda, <br/>

stinky <br/>
&gt; and marshy!) :-P<br/>

&gt; But the week prior, we had great success finding the Uva's Canyon <br/>

Dear MM,<br/>
Apparently the woods near the firing range were, shall we say, <br/>
singed.  One of the hazards of being a demon hangout, I suppose.  The <br/>
box, however, is in excellent condition and the small conflagration <br/>
has been effectively extinguished.  We took the liberty of upgrading <br/>
the stamp in the box.  For those who have already found the box, be <br/>
satisfied that you now have a rare collectors' edition imprint of our <br/>
first "primitive art" stamp.  For those of you yet to find the box, <br/>
you can look forward to having a new and (we think) greatly improved <br/>
stamp.  Thanks for the heads up, MM!<br/>

&gt; First off, there won't be a hint in the EMS store video, as we <br/>
weren't able to make the video :)<br/>
&gt; Now, on to boxes.  We've found Say What, Paint Works and the <br/>
Glendora Tavern box all ok.  Also, we've done our EMS staff boxes and <br/>
they're there with no errors.  <br/>
&gt; I could not find the 70 million years ago box.  I had the spot, and <br/>
a pile of rocks, but to no avail.  I have seen that others have had <br/>
trouble finding it.  It is a bit of a popular place, as there were <br/>
beer cans strewn about.<br/>
&gt; Now, on to Splashing in the Devil's tub.  I have a friend that <br/>
found it last week.  I went today however, and the wildlife <br/>
management area in that spot was on fire :-(   I obviously could not <br/>
get it myself.  So you may want to check on it's safety soon.<br/>
