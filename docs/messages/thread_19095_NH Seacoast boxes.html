I sent this to the NE LB Chat group and didn't get any replies.  Maybe someone who reads from the wider group might know something.<br/>

We went letterboxing on the NH seacoast today.  We found Susie Sells Seashells LB but think the Portsmouth Harbor Light and Hear the Sea LB's are both missing.  Has anyone else done these recently?  We were fairly certain we found the right spot, even some rocks that most likely concealed, but could find no signs of the letterboxes.  Let me know if anyone else has info on them.  <br/>

Phyto and I searched for these boxes last May. We had<br/>
no luck in finding "Hear the Sea" either. I recall seeing<br/>
several other posts on the list saying the same. <br/>
<br/>
We did find "Portsmouth Harbor Light", which I recall<br/>
being a fairly challenging find, as the bearings in<br/>
the clue don't quite work. See message 34371 for a more<br/>
recent find of this box (last October). The box was<br/>
fairly well hidden. I would not be suprised<br/>
if it is still there, lurking in the rocks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Isosceles.  We may have to try for "Portmouth Harbor Light" <br/>
a second time.  We found the bearings to be off and it appeared the <br/>
placer referred to the wrong information sign as well.  It was our <br/>
first unsuccessful quest.  We searched for quite a while but maybe <br/>
we need to try again on a new day.  Thanks for the archives number.  <br/>
It was from before we joined the chat group so I hadn't seen it.  <br/>
