	 Unintentionally stepped on the Mystery Box by pure accident. Very slow<br/>
learner, just found the ? indicating  those boxes on the web site!   <br/>
Only one  LLBLB now -  free to find without this confusion.    Next time<br/>
we will look for this one when we are in the area - Budster of the<br/>
Catskills<br/>
<br/>
P.S. On another front , I volunteered to do  a school project using<br/>
Microsoft Powerpoint to create a 6-8 slide presentation on LETTERBOXING.<br/>
( about 5 minutes or so)<br/>
<br/>
1) Title Slide _ Letterboxing - fun for the young at heart<br/>
2) What is letterboxing?<br/>
3) History<br/>
4) Equipment<br/>
5) Rules &amp; Etiquette<br/>
6) Difficulty System ratings<br/>
8) Web Sites<br/>
<br/>
Not necessarily in that order - any suggestions?<br/>

Hey, I'm keeping track of my hobby by powerpoint too!  I take pictures of all my carvings <br/>
and boxes BEFORE I release them into the wild.  I also take pictures of the journey and put <br/>
them under the Title ... "What we saw along the way!"  I am considering getting this into a <br/>
book format and at my first anniversary, April-16-2005, printing "Letterboxing: My first <br/>
year" or something along those lines.  It will be my coffee table book for visitors to my <br/>
home.  That way, they can decide how much of this great obsession they can take at a <br/>
time (okay, you can grin at that thought).<br/>

PS - I NEVER take pictures of the location of my Finds.  That way, I won't be able to divulge <br/>
any spoilers by accident.<br/>

<br/>
I always enjoy reading your posts.<br/>
<br/>
Another two Powerpoint  topics:<br/>
  1.. Fragile areas and leave no trace<br/>
  2.. Governmental concerns and opportunities for cooperation<br/>
The presentation sounds good, perhaps you will find a way to post it after your first presentation?  Sounds like many of us could benefit from the format.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
