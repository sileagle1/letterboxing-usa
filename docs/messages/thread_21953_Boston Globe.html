journalism professor and tend to come down on the side of reporters.  But<br/>
consider for a moment:<br/>
    -- Are there more than a handful of people on this list who would even<br/>
know about letterboxing if the Smithsonian article hand not been published?<br/>
    -- Would U.S. letterboxing exist outside of New England if word of the<br/>
hobby was not spread by the media?<br/>
    -- Has letterboxing in Dartmoor fallen into abject ruin because of the<br/>
hundreds of articles written about it?<br/>
<br/>
    Public opinion is the ultimate Pandora's box.  To find out what is in<br/>
it, you have to release the spirits inside.  If you think in terms of media<br/>
literacy, though, you soon realize those spirits can be evil demons or<br/>
guardian angels depending on how you treat them.<br/>
<br/>
    Forget about keeping your hobby a secret.  With blogs, e-mail, Web sits<br/>
(not to mention the Globe and other traditional major media) in every nook<br/>
of our existence, there are no more secrets.  Instead, use the media<br/>
attention to your benefit.  Make your boxes harder to find (casual wannabees<br/>
give up easily).  Use your 30-seconds of fame to promote the sane, graceful<br/>
lifestyle of letterboxing.  Or use the mass media themselves for the hobby<br/>
-- has anyone placed clues in the "personal" ads or used the text of a<br/>
front-page article as a code sheet?<br/>
<br/>
    As a boy in the 1960s, I first experienced the thrill I now associate<br/>
with a letterboxing hunt thanks to the media. A radio station in my home<br/>
town hid a chest of "silver" dollars and then aired a doggerel clue each<br/>
day.  I never found the treasure, but I listened for the patch of poem each<br/>
day and scoured the part of town I was sure held the chest.<br/>
<br/>
    If you don't want a social hobby, make up one of your own.  I carve duck<br/>
decoys and throw them into rivers.  And I hide coins in construction sites.<br/>
But I look for letterboxes because I'm part of a hobby community.<br/>
<br/>
    Beware of a wish to close the door before the world comes running in.<br/>
Someone else could just as easily slam it first -- and leave you on the<br/>
wrong side.<br/>
<br/>
PS  RE the Irish box thread -- Illia is my daughter and son-in-law.  They<br/>
have several new boxes and would love to see visitors plant some that THEY<br/>
can find.  The secret to finding Irish boxes is to click on "other<br/>
international" in the state box of the Letterboxing.org search.<br/>

It just amazes me how some people think! You started in 2000. That is not  <br/>
that long ago and now you want to close the hobby from the world. What if  <br/>
someone had thought the same way you do in 1999 and closed you out of the hobby? <br/>
<br/>
I just started the letterbox hobby a few weeks ago. But I learned about  it <br/>
about a year ago. I was in a coffee shop with my daughters and saw a man  <br/>
carving a stamp. I stopped and asked what he was doing. He explained to us all  <br/>
about letter boxing. My kids and I thought it was a really cool thing and  <br/>
thought about doing it then, but we never really did anything and the idea went  <br/>
away.  About a month ago I was reading an article in TIME magazine and it  <br/>
reminded me of the hobby.  The kids and I went out and got some supplies  and <br/>
started right up.  Now we have already found 3 boxes and are planning a  summer <br/>
vacation around the treasure hunt game. We are also learning to carve our  own <br/>
stamps and will soon be leaving a few boxes of our own to share.  If  TIME <br/>
magazine had not run an article about Letter boxing we would not have this  great <br/>
new hobby to do together as a family. Who knows, maybe it will become a  family <br/>
tradition that can be passed on to future generations.<br/>

Clyde, What might seem absurd to you may not to others. What you <br/>
fail to take into consideration is the lack of respect the general <br/>
public has for the press. The discharge of the First Amendment has <br/>
certainly suffered, and more and more folks have become aware of <br/>
this lack of truth telling. Much of the news today is blurred by <br/>
slanted comment, and unfortunately I don't even need to furnish an <br/>
example, there are several that come easily to mind. The Press has <br/>
brought this on by it's willingness to push a point of view rather <br/>
than respecting it's duty to be fair and impartial. While you <br/>
certainly make some interesting points, it is difficult to simply <br/>
discount feelings when addressing whether one should grant <br/>
interviews or not. I believe that letterboxing would have spread, <br/>
albeit much slower,by word of mouth. A slow spread doesn't mean that <br/>
it isn't successful,only that it grows slower. So while there will <br/>
always be someone looking for their "30 seconds of fame" I have <br/>
chosen not to participate and not agreeing to being interviewed by a <br/>
reporter who's only care is to sell the story. You in your position <br/>
can help change the way people look at the press by returning those <br/>
lost ethics to the journalism profession. I would certainly like to <br/>
return to believing some of what I read, hear, and watch when it <br/>
comes to the news rather than question every last bit.<br/>

The Globe story was well-written and accurate.  The critics of it simply wanted to keep <br/>
that good information to themselves.  That is both ineffective and uncivilized.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I spend a great deal of time teaching ethics and also working on new ways to let the <br/>
public participate in the press.  I'm an advocate of what we call "open source" journalism <br/>
where folks like you do the writing and we journalists just provide a focus.  Check http://<br/>
mymissourian.com for an example -- go to the sports section and you will even find a <br/>
photo essay on a letterboxing gathering.  Newspapers across the country are starting <br/>
similar sites to let readers like you tell us what the "real" news is.<br/>

And as such "Life goes on"!  I just don't believe that people who read  TIME <br/>
magazine are running out to steal the letter boxes. Maybe it is their  teenage <br/>
kids who read the magazine because they don't have anything better to  do. <br/>
Sorry your story does not hold water.  I don't believe that you  lost 15 boxes <br/>
the week after the TIME magazine article was written.  If  that was the case <br/>
why is it that you are the only one with such a catastrophic  loss of boxes?  If <br/>
there were so many boxes "stolen" the week after that  article was published, <br/>
why are we discussing the Globe and not TIME magazine?  Maybe I missed the <br/>
part of the TIME article that mentioned your specific area to  direct people <br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
Now I do agree with the comments about contacting the letterbox hider with  <br/>
rude remarks.  That type of activity is not called for.  Maybe some  boxes have <br/>
easy clues so small children can participate with their families.  What is <br/>
easy for one person may be very difficult for another.<br/>

I, too, had several boxes 'disappear' after the article debuted.  <br/>
I'm also located in an opposite corner of the country than Don.  So, <br/>
despite elevating the popularity of letterboxing to caring and <br/>
astute letterboxers ou there, it did impact me negatively, as well.  <br/>
I've since just about stopped planting boxes--especially in urban <br/>
areas for this very reason.<br/>

&gt; While you might <br/>

&gt; that apparantly <br/>

&gt; not to sure that it would have been even better  to<br/>
&gt; let the folks <br/>
&gt; that primarily find letterboxes know what kind of<br/>
&gt; idiotic  notes are <br/>
&gt; received from what might be considered new<br/>
&gt; letterboxers.Some of  them <br/>
&gt; are pretty demanding and out right rude. While that<br/>
&gt; certainly is not  <br/>
&gt; the case in most instances, placers do like to hear<br/>
&gt; about their  <br/>
&gt; letterboxes, but they don't like to be told that<br/>
&gt; their clues suck, <br/>
&gt; or  other such descriptions regarding their<br/>
&gt; letterbox. Those notes in <br/>
&gt; most  likelyhood weren't from anyone that has been<br/>

<br/>
Nor did I say such a thing. What I did say was that in the next week <br/>
we "lost" 15 of our letterboxes. At the time it was approximately <br/>
10% of our total placed. The losses I believe came from new <br/>
letterboxers that failed to be stealthy, or failed to rehide <br/>
letterboxes properly. I believe new boxers did not take the time to <br/>
consider the way they should approach this game.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sorry your story does not hold water.  I don't believe that you  <br/>
lost 15 boxes <br/>
&gt; the week after the TIME magazine article was written.<br/>
<br/>
Well I guess that is your right.  We currently have a P count of <br/>
183, I rarely use PFX in a post, but do so here to help make a <br/>
point. We occasionally have boxes go missing and in fact have a <br/>
fairly accurate accounting, so we monitor our boxes and when 15 go <br/>
missing(not stolen) in one week we recognize it as being somewhat <br/>
remarkable. I realize that to many a 15 letterbox loss would be much <br/>
more significant, but even in our position 15 letterboxes amounts to <br/>
a sizeable portion of time and effort.<br/>
<br/>
  If  that was the case <br/>
&gt; why is it that you are the only one with such a catastrophic  loss <br/>
of boxes? <br/>
<br/>
I believe you should check the list's archives for the lively posts <br/>
at the time and I'm sure that you will find there were several <br/>
placers that had similar losses. There was much discussion at the <br/>
time, and this current discussion is like beating the dead horse. <br/>
Why don't you go back through the list and read it for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
 If <br/>
&gt; there were so many boxes "stolen" the week after that  article was <br/>
published,<br/>
<br/>
Your inference about "stolen" seems to be an attempt to ridicule <br/>
what I have previously written. If you wish to quote me so be it, <br/>
but please do so correctly. I wrote "lost", and that has an entirely <br/>
different connotation. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; why are we discussing the Globe and not TIME magazine?  Maybe I <br/>
missed the <br/>
&gt; part of the TIME article that mentioned your specific area to  <br/>
direct people <br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
<br/>
We were discussing publicity, and I believe that both Time and the <br/>
Globe fall into that category<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Now I do agree with the comments about contacting the letterbox <br/>
hider with  <br/>
&gt; rude remarks.  That type of activity is not called for.  Maybe <br/>
some  boxes have <br/>
&gt; easy clues so small children can participate with their families.  <br/>
What is <br/>
&gt; easy for one person may be very difficult for another.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; SLOMAN<br/>
<br/>
Well I am glad that we can agree on something, but I do fail to see <br/>
the corelation between rudeness and the difficulty of clues. Having <br/>
difficult clues is a great part of this game, and families with <br/>
small children could use difficult clues a a "Life's lesson", and <br/>
shouldn't use them as an excuse to be a jerk.<br/>
