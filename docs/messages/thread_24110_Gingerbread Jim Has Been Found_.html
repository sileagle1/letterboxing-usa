Early Tuesday morning, during a rather long and cold search, and end <br/>
finally was near. It has turned out, that a couple from MA had come <br/>
up for the search and became instant heros. Through the snow and ice, <br/>
around frozen ponds, up hills and down slopes, they searched until <br/>
they found Jim.<br/>
The Ryan Family come from Carver, MA. A very kind and loving family, <br/>
had decided to come up for the search once before, only to get <br/>
sidelined by a flat tire while dropping the kids of at the <br/>
grandparents house. With determination, they made there way to the <br/>
woods of NH to find Jim, and did. We tried to contact them, but no <br/>
call was returned.<br/>
Not to be over done, The Ryan Family had also helped in the capture <br/>
of the kidnappper. A 37 year old man, not yet identified, was <br/>
arrested Tuesday. Reports say, that he was walking through the woods, <br/>
and spotted The Ryan Family with Jim, when he turned and ran. The <br/>
Ryan Family quickly followed behind, only to find the kidnapper <br/>
hiding under some bark. A court date has not yet been scheduled.<br/>
Right now, Gingerbread Jim is currently in the hospital, suffering <br/>
from hypothermia and malnutrition. The hospital didn't want to <br/>
comment on his condition, but rumor has it, he isn't doing well.<br/>
