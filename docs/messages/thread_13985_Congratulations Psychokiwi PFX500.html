&gt; After weeks of not doing much boxing, Psychokiwi #2 and I got off <br/>
our behinds<br/>
&gt; and got outdoors. Saturday we went on an elephant safari (thanks <br/>
Chuck for<br/>
&gt; such a cute series!) and Sunday we went searching for birds and <br/>
butterflies.<br/>
&gt; We were delighted to finally PFX=500, and did so in style with a <br/>
beautiful<br/>
&gt; Drewclan butterfly kiss (what a gorgeous set of stamps Jay!!!). <br/>
We've also had<br/>
&gt; fun "P-ing," and will hopefully have some more boxes out soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We also bumped into Pat &amp; Amy, Sadie &amp; Russ, and Chuck, Molly, &amp; <br/>
Chickabirdee<br/>
&gt; on the trails. Was fun catching up with you all. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
