<br/>
Will a dislocated shoulder get one on the mailing list of the PLB for <br/>
those injured in the line of boxing duty.  Turtle McQuade, our kiddos <br/>
(her 2, my 1) and I were at a box that required reaching under a <br/>
juniper bush.  Out popped my left shoulder!  Youch!  It eventually <br/>
slorped back in after a few minutes...  A touch sore tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Is this enough to warrant being put on the list for the "Box formerly <br/>
known as the Purple Heart?"<br/>
<br/>
Lightnin' Bug<br/>
Wounded, but still boxing.<br/>
