Hi Ginger,<br/>
<br/>
I did a tour of my letterboxes today and discovered that the trails <br/>
at Hunters Falls had been rerouted.  The letterbox is still there and <br/>
intact in its original location - but Target 1 and the orange rebar <br/>
have been moved to a secondary trail.  I have posted new clues - <br/>
namely to follow the trail over the bridge and through the woods, but <br/>
where the trail forks, keep to the water side trail to the left.  <br/>
There is a boulder and a freshly cut tree at the fork.  Count 15 <br/>
paces from the fork along the water side trail to a pine sapling.  <br/>
The ledge rock hiding spot is at the base of the pine sapling.  <br/>
Target 1 and the orange rebar have been moved to the right fork of <br/>
the trail and are visible from the fork looking inland, but are no <br/>
longer relevant to the clues.  I decided to keep the letterbox in its <br/>
original location because the view from there is prettier.<br/>
<br/>
I try to do a tour of my letterboxes every few months to make sure <br/>
they are still there.  I know my own keen sense of frustration to <br/>
spend a day letterboxing only to discover that the box(es) is long <br/>
gone and not reported missing!<br/>
<br/>
I discovered your post *after* I had made my tour and posted my <br/>
findings.  I regret your fruitless search on this one!<br/>

<br/>
No problem!  I had fun going to Tangled Woods and Pepperpoint that day.  Ran<br/>
out of time to do the one at Farmer Harveys, so will go back and do Hunter<br/>
Falls and that one!<br/>
<br/>
    Cheers!<br/>
