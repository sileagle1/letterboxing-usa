<br/>
	Back on March 25th of last year, having just read the now- infamous<br/>
Smithsonian article about Letterboxing, I went on the net, hoping to<br/>
find fellow travelers here in the US.  Two inquiries to the UK were<br/>
sent, to Ray Aucote and Trevor Dallas. I received a timely response from<br/>
each, but alas, there was no news of any US letterboxing activity.<br/>
<br/>
	Disappointed but with high hopes, I decided to start placing<br/>
letterboxes myself, in the region around my home (VT), and find a way to<br/>
involve others in the quest. Then, to my immense joy and surprise, on<br/>
April 7, the following e-mail arrived from some guy in St Paul named Dan<br/>
Servatius:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; From: <br/>
&gt; Daniel Servatius <elf@pclink.com><br/>
&gt; To: davisarc@wcvt.com&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Erik &amp; Sue, I got your names from Trevor at:  trevor.dallas@virgin.net<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I live in Minnesota in the United States.  I saw an article in<br/>
&gt; Smithsonian magazine about Dartmoor letterboxing.  I ended up at your<br/>
&gt; web page looking for information on letterboxing.  I am wondering how I<br/>
&gt; might start it here.  Should I buy some stamps, ink pads, boxes and<br/>
&gt; notebooks, and then plant them in various places?  How do the<br/>
&gt; instructions (clues) work?  And what about the mapping?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any information you provide will be greatly appreciated.  Are there<br/>
&gt; official rules?  Is there a book or magazine I could buy that would help<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; get me started?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you.<br/>

&gt; Good to hear of someone else similiarily taken with this strange<br/>
&gt; pasttime. I know nothing beyond the Smithsonian article, plus the few<br/>
&gt; pages I've found similar to Trevor Dallas's. Perhaps we should nominate<br/>
&gt; each other as chairpersons for our respective states? Seriously, I have<br/>
&gt; hoped to generate some local interest here in VT and nearby region, and<br/>
&gt; perhaps start placing some  boxes at locations around the state, such as<br/>
&gt; on hiking trails, etc, at places that vacationing people might like to<br/>
&gt; visit, and somehow making the clues available-perhaps via the WEB. I<br/>
&gt; need constant encouragement, so keep at me! <br/>
&gt; I agree that the USGS map is a good basis on which to work, however,<br/>
&gt; trails would also work - a clue might suggest, say, "north .4 miles, on<br/>
&gt; so-and-so trail, when you can see both the summit and a waterfall, bear<br/>
&gt; off trail, etc, etc." We have several locations where major hiking<br/>
&gt; trails cross or meet roads, throughout the state, to that was  why I<br/>
&gt; thought of this as a way to start. I'm open to other ideas. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd suggest putting in postcards with your name and address, as well as<br/>
&gt; a notebook, so that you can easily get a sense of any visitors, perhaps<br/>
&gt; a little sheet describing the concept to encourage a chance finder to<br/>
&gt; respect the contents. Of course, you need to develop some nifty stamps<br/>
&gt; to stick in the box, as well as your own for when you come to Vt to<br/>
&gt; visit mine!<br/>
&gt; Another link to try; ray@aucote.u-net.com<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep in touch!<br/>

<br/>
I look back to this day as the start of US Letterboxing, if not as the<br/>
date of the first Letterbox, at least the date of two minds coming<br/>
together to start it. Within a week, Dan'l had a web page up, which has<br/>
certainly been the greatest cause for growth of the hobby in this<br/>
country. We were soon joined by Doug Gustafson, Michelle, Shannon Green<br/>
and Nisa.<br/>
<br/>
 3 weeks later, Eric Mings sent us the following message, and soon<br/>
established the Letterboxing Talk list, which was instrumental in<br/>
opening lines of communication among devotees:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Subject: Your interest in Letterboxing<br/>
&gt; Date: Sun, 26 Apr 1998 13:17:39 -0400<br/>
&gt; From: Eric Mings <elm@ao.net><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had recently written to Ray at ray@aucote.u-net.com regarding the <br/>
&gt; interesting article in Smithsonian about Letterboxing in England. I had <br/>
&gt; asked him for more information and he wrote back saying that he had <br/>
&gt; received quite a few inquiries. I am interested in promoting the hobby in <br/>
&gt; the US. He had given me a few email addresses of persons who had <br/>
&gt; expressed similar interest, which is why I am writing you. I have <br/>
&gt; considerable experience in both mailing list administration and website <br/>
&gt; development, and tentatively plan to launch an "International <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing Club" site on the web to promote communication between <br/>
&gt; people with this interest. If you are interested in being informed on my <br/>
&gt; progress, or contributing to this effort please write back and let me <br/>
&gt; know. Otherwise you will not hear from me again. I will very shortly have <br/>
&gt; a mailing list discussion group up and running to talk about this hobby. <br/>
&gt; Thanks. <br/>
&gt; Regards, <br/>
&gt; Eric Mings Ph.D.<br/>
**************<br/>
As they say, the rest is history.<br/>
<br/>
We were also soon joined by two "Dartmoorians" (Adrian and Graham), who<br/>
have been a wonderful source of advice and humor. And by many more from<br/>
all parts of the U.S..<br/>
<br/>
The year has been successful beyond my wildest expectation!  My e-mail<br/>
log shows about 80 people having participated, in one degree or another,<br/>
in the two talk lists. In one year, there have been 3262 messages, or<br/>
almost 70 per week! <br/>
<br/>
The first US Letterbox was placed 3 weeks after the starting date,<br/>
Prayer Rock, in Bristol, VT, on 4/30/98. We now have about 90<br/>
letterboxes hidden, in at least 20 states! (Photo of the Rock is<br/>
attached).<br/>
<br/>
We have had our moments of soul-searching, to be sure. I am happy that,<br/>
for the most part, Letterboxing in the US is open, commercial-free, and<br/>
participatory at a grass-roots level. All ideas are welcome, and indeed<br/>
the whole US complexion of this hobby has evolved as a result of the<br/>
collective input of many, many energetic and creative minds. <br/>
<br/>
 In addition to letterBOXES, we have started a variant called<br/>
letterBOOKS (thanks to Tom Cooch for the first one). And we are<br/>
exploring ways to get kids involved in this hobby.  Dan has shared his<br/>
web-page passwords with Mitch and Randy, and the synergy has resulted in<br/>
a constant improvement to our "home". In October, we obtained the<br/>
"Letterboxing.org" domain name, to keep the hobby open and commercial<br/>
-free. The web-page has complete information on getting started, how to<br/>
carve stamps, where to get supplies, what to put in a letterbox. We all<br/>
have much to be proud about!<br/>
<br/>
Like many of you, I have met people through this hobby, who have become<br/>
good friends, some I have met in person, many more only through the<br/>
computer screen and keyboard. You have shown your friendship in times of<br/>
personal difficulty and I thank you. It has also been fun to hear of<br/>
other meetings - Dan and Thom and Mitch, later the Texas ladies,<br/>
others.  I hope that the next year fares as well.<br/>
<br/>
So, where do we go from here?  I propose a few modest goals:<br/>
1: All 50 states by year 2,000 ("50 x YK2").<br/>
2: 200 active participants by 4/7/2000.<br/>
3: 200 letterboxes by 4/7/2000<br/>
4: Perhaps a convention of Letterboxers, including a few folks from the<br/>
UK?<br/>
5: More of the same comraderie, humor, good will  and creative thought<br/>
that has been the hallmark of this past year.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who made this First Year of US Letterboxing happen:<br/>
Chris Granstrom, and Adrian Williams, for the Smithsonian article, Dan<br/>
Servatius, both for his tireless work and his conscience, to Randy and<br/>
Mitch for their creative energy, to my wife Susan, for embracing this<br/>
hobby with me.<br/>
And to all of you:<br/>

It's really very exciting to see how this hobby has grown in only a year's time, thanks to the initiative and imagination of everybody you mentioned in your post.  For myself, I really have  to thank my sister Betsey, who handed me the Smithsonian article last June when I was visiting her in Boston, and said, "Here, this might interest you." Right after that I searched on letterboxing in Yahoo and discovered the Letterboxing USA Web page.  And since then, it's been quite a lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Erik, Dan, Mitch, Randy and everybody else--<br/>

Hi Erik et al.<br/>
Thanks for the picture of Prayer Rock, it looks like a nice place to<br/>
go boxing, or just to sit and enjoy. I must admit to being pleased and<br/>
a little embarrassed to feature in you list of pioneers, since I have<br/>
contributed little to the group, being until now a lurker.<br/>
	Now everybody knows I exist, I had better tell a little about<br/>
myself. I live and work in London, but I'm a country boy at heart<br/>
having been raised in a little village called Goudhurst in deepest<br/>
Kent, the south eastern most county in the UK. I was introduced to<br/>
letterboxing about a year ago  by Graham (aka The Moorland Wizard) who<br/>
was arranging an outing to Dartmoor with another friend and his<br/>
family. It turned out that there was a spare seat in the bus and they<br/>
offered it to me, I jumped at it, and that was it , I had the boxing<br/>
bug.<br/>
 Thanks to you all for makig L.U.S.A. an entertaining and informative<br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Regards to all<br/>
<br/>
