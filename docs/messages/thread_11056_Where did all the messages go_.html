<p>I don't know if this is the same problem you all are facing, but...  There were about 24 hours when I didn't have any messages on my hotmail account (extremely unusual because this is such an active list!).  Then, I got a message from Yahoo saying they were closing my account because it was bouncing all its messages!  I contacted them (as per their instructions) to reopen the account -- but still no messages.  I tried to resubscribe to the list but was told I was already listed as a member.  I emailed Yahoo again....</p></div>
<div>For whatever reason, more than a day later, LBNA messages started appearing in my junk mail folder.  I moved them over and everything seems to be ok now.</div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>Unfortunately, I don't know if anything I did fixed the problem or if it just resolved itself on its own.  Just wanted to let others know that this was happening.  It will be interesting to find out if this is a wide spread problem.  I figured it was just my account.  BeMa </div>

<div></div>&gt;This is really a test... For some reason I went to see the most 
<div></div>
<div></div>&gt;recent messages and there are none. I get some sort of error message.

<div></div>&gt;Maybe this one will post. We will see.
