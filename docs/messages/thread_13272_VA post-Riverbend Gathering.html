announcing "we're here for the Lb picnic" and getting deer in the headlights<br/>
looks, we finally found the correct gathering!)<br/>
What a great day despite the predicted bad weather!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Mother of Crickets for organizning the gathering.  Even though she<br/>
was very humble, saying it wasn't that hard.  It's the fact that she<br/>
actually did pull it off. With everyones' busy lives, it was just one more<br/>
thing to do on her full plate of things to do.  She mentioned to have it<br/>
again next year in May (but the next year, Memorial Day is the last weekend<br/>
in May).  My thoughts were to have it annually the first Saturday after<br/>
Memorial Day Weekend, which in 2004 would fall in June.  That way we can<br/>
plan in advance.  What are everyone's thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
As my friend Turtle Trekker said, "I felt like a celebrity, everyone asking<br/>
for our personal stamps!"  As we arrived, the group was busy stamping away<br/>
and we just started right in.  I didn't even get to eat lunch (which BTW<br/>
wouldn't hurt if I missed a meal or two)!  What a way to boost our count:<br/>
eXchanges 29, travelers 4, events 1/3.<br/>
<br/>
I was really impressed to meet Sadie and Russ and 1/2 of Wanda and Pete,<br/>
that came all the way from CT!  Now that's what Lb is all about!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the people who carved the 3 wonderful event stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>

but I want also to point a most thankful, identifying finger in the direction of <br/>
Daughter of the Old Dominion.  Mary helped me pick out a park, including <br/>
personally going to show us crickets Fountainhead Park, and was an unending font <br/>
of ideas, suggestions and gentle reminders when I forgot what I was doing.  <br/>
Merci, Mary!  Can't wait to do some more of your boxes and lay some new ones in <br/>
wait for you myself.<br/>
