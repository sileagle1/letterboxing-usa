This may be a cross-post, but I feel the need to be optomistic here <br/>
in southern CT....yesterday we woke up to more snow - it continued <br/>
snowing for part of the morning, dumping 4 or 5 more inches, BUT <br/>
THEN, the sun came out and it warmed up to the high 30's! Turned out <br/>
to be beautiful day! Took advantage of the great weather and went <br/>
out trudging through the snow to check on some of my hibernating <br/>
boxes!<br/>
Spring is coming and the Snowdrops are peeking out of the mud and <br/>
snow in our garden! Life is good!<br/>

I had the same thoughts this weekend and carved a Think Spring!!!HH <br/>
which I released into the wild today.<br/>
<br/>
And I do mean "wild".  I mailed it to The Sprite in NY ;-)<br/>
