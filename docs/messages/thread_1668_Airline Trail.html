&gt;I've been thinking of trying to get the Lebanon Recreation Commission to<br/>
&gt;fund sprucing up the Lebanon section of the Airline Trail, from where they<br/>
&gt;left off at the Hebron line to Willimantic and see if Columbia wants to<br/>
&gt;help as it runs along the border. Then if Willimantic/Windham can fix their<br/>
&gt;portion, we would really have something grand.<br/>

I have to make a correction here. Almost immediately after I posted this, I <br/>
remembered that Windham has done a considerable amount of work on their end <br/>
of the Trail. I forgot they have had bike hikes along it beginning out near <br/>
that new Wal-Mart past the bowling alley. I believe they've also had <br/>
Walking Weekend events along it.<br/>
