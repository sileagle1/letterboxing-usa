I think that's it.  I was just in Orlando last week.  I can tell you that <br/>
the Wilderness Lodge and Caribbean Beach boxes are both in <br/>
place.  The Wilderness Lodge logbook could use a new Ziploc <br/>
bag, however, and the Caribbean Beach logbook is full.<br/>
<br/>
I emailed the placer about these things, but if you are searching <br/>
for these boxes, pehaps you could be a good citizen and bring <br/>
along bags and a fresh logbook (the Caribbean box is big and <br/>
can easily hold a 4 x 6 book). I was traveling light and had no <br/>
extra supplies when I was there.<br/>
<br/>
I did not search for the Celebration box.<br/>

There are some very nice letterboxes in the DeLand area, which is<br/>
just about an hour's drive north.  Two are in town, and 5 are on an <br/>
island.  We re-visited the two in town with our son just recently and<br/>
they are a hoot!  There is also one in DeLeon springs, slightly <br/>
north of Deland.  We just put one out in the Disney Wildnerness<br/>
Preserve just south of Kissimmee last week -- clues will be on the <br/>
website within a day or two.  If you are traveling by car, we also<br/>
put one out at Guana River Wildlife Sanctuary just north of St <br/>
Augustine (near Ponte Vedra beach).  Why not carve and leave a few<br/>
letterboxes while you are there?  There are quite a few state and <br/>
county parks in the Orlando area that are crying out for letterboxes!<br/>

I will have very limited time, but I will see how close DeLeon is to me.<br/>

I am very hesitant to leave boxes in other states where I will not be around<br/>

I feel responsible to the others searching for them to keep them in good<br/>
health.<br/>
I suppose if I can identify a friendly local who can keep an eye on them,<br/>
that would be ok.<br/>
<br/>
I'll think about it.  I like placing almost as much as finding.<br/>

The DeLand series of five boxes (the Florida Ancients) are in a great <br/>
setting, but they were in pretty bad shape when RichBeau and I logged them <br/>
last March or April. The owner has moved away from the area, as well (as <br/>
you can see from the clues page). I highly recommend the trip to the park, <br/>
but it would be great if someone could refurbish them with new logs, <br/>
baggies and boxes.<br/>
<br/>
(The ones in town weren't accessible on Sunday that we were there....)<br/>
