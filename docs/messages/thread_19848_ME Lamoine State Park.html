With the recent press, I think it is imperative that the original placers be notified. <br/>
The campgrounds for this park are not so thrilled. I'm not willing to take ownership <br/>
at this point either because of that. There was some discussion on the LBNE list, <br/>
but it is right down the street from me. I'm just not involved in boxing politics to <br/>
the point of writing letters to the state authorities. Sorry, not interested.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bringing it up on the big list Deb!<br/>

Well, I did the "contact the placer" thing 2 weeks ago when we found it.   <br/>
Didn't get an answer, but you can never tell if that's because they're gone, or <br/>
just because they don't bother to reply.<br/>
<br/>
I would assume (but you know what they say about that!) that before they <br/>
archive clues, they try at least once to contact the placers.<br/>
<br/>
I just think it's such a shame, with so many boxes going missing (many of <br/>
them mine, LOL!) that there's a perfectly good box, with a viable stamp, a dry <br/>
logbook, and even an inkpad, out there that'll never be found again.   :::sniff <br/>
sniff:::   Maybe we should have a virtual funeral for it or something.<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell I'm up too late and should be sleeping?<br/>

I think the park is peeved because permission wasn't asked AND the box<br/>
clues require finders to search through areas that they should not be<br/>
in. (campers only areas, etc) <br/>
<br/>
The placers should be contacted. If they CANNOT contacted, is it<br/>
possible to move the box to a better hiding spot? There are many areas<br/>
near there where it can be moved, but I wouldn't want to do so without<br/>
 trying as hard as we could to contact the placers.<br/>

It would be a shame to lose a box in this area, especially at this<br/>
time of year.<br/>

With the combination of not being able to contact the placers and the <br/>
property management not wanting the box there the box will be de-<br/>
listed unless someone takes responsiblity for it.  If you would like <br/>
to adopt the box and move it to a more suitable location let me know <br/>
and I will change the status so that you can maintain the clues.<br/>

If the park were amenable, it is possible to leave the box where it is and <br/>
change the clues so you don't have to go through the camping area.   We actually <br/>
got there from the other side.   That'd be up to the park, though.<br/>
<br/>
The other thought I had was to rescue the box and plant it somewhere other <br/>
than the park . . . only the stamp has the name of the park on it, so that might <br/>
not be appropriate, either.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like several attempts have been made to contact the placer with no <br/>
effect, so if someone's willing, it'd be a good idea to either adjust the clues <br/>
or get the box out of the park, in the interest of not making the park people <br/>
madder at us than they already are.<br/>
<br/>
Easy for me to say, way down here in South Florida!<br/>
