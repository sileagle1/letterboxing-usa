Die LB at Fort Stark, Newcastle Island in New Hampshire.  <br/>
<br/>
The story goes, <br/>
<br/>
Cling Clang was an actual peddler man who traveled up and down the <br/>
coast of Maine and New Hampshire selling his wares. He carried two <br/>
large stilts that he would place in front of him so he could catapult <br/>
himself 12 feet forward in one leap. This way he covered twice as <br/>
much ground in half the time. His peddlers pack which was strapped to <br/>
his back would make all kinds of noise which is where his name came <br/>
from.  <br/>
<br/>
Please help Cling Clang see the world. <br/>
<br/>

We will honor this request in the very near future.<br/>
