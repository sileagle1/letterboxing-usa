September <br/>
12, 2002, by M. Gainey. (The county that Wrangell is in is not<br/>
known.) <br/>
<br/>
This box was planted on Petroglyph Beach. It does not contain a <br/>
pencil. Because this box is an orphan, after you stamp in, could you <br/>
please send me a note about its condition at mlgainey@yahoo.com? <br/>
Thanks and happy trails!<br/>
<br/>
Walk down the ramp to Petroglyph Beach.<br/>
<br/>
If you come at high tide, less of the beach will be exposed (and thus <br/>
virtually none of the petroglyphs), but you might still be able to <br/>
stamp in to the box. But it's really best to come at low tide. Check <br/>
the tidal tables at this link on the Wrangell Chamber of Commerce Web <br/>
