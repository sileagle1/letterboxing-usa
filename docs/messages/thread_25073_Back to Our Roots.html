It has taken me 48 hours to process all the fun I had over the weekend in West Dover VT at Back to Our Roots.<br/>
<br/>
It was such an honor to be in the company of so many who have helped shape this hobby of ours since it started so many years ago.  It was also so much fun to spend time with letterboxers from all over the country and close to home.  It was fun to chat with new boxers and to get to know others I have met before even better.  I was fortunate enough to share a B&amp;B with boxers I know, and boxers from far away that I haven't met before.  Thanks to J.E.S.S.sea, Lundy &amp; Vickster, Tiptoe &amp; Tonto and Silver Eagle for making our stay at the West Dover in so entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone we spent time with on the trails for making us laugh and sharing the fun! (And no Deanna, you are definitely NOT old, no matter what those folks on the bikes said!)<br/>
<br/>
It was a truly unique event.  There were so many fantastic boxes out there on beautiful (and muddy) trails.  I cannot believe the amount of work Mark and Sue put into creating all the boxes that there were to find.  They were kind and gracious hosts and bent over backwards to make sure that everyone was having a good time.  The clue packets alone were amazing, packed with clues, trivia, information and trail maps!  They even included coupons for extra treats with lunch from various venues.  <br/>
When you add in the great rates from the inn and the wonderful items raffled off, the whole event was perfect!<br/>
<br/>
The letterboxers in attendance were all so relaxed, laid back and eager not only to get out and box, but equally eager to sit and chat a while and share stories with all us who have joined this hobby in the last few years or months.<br/>
<br/>
I really don't know how to put into words how much fun we had getting "Back to our Roots".  Even my husband (my "long suffering spouse") commented on how gracious everyone was and even admitted that he had had a wonderful time.  THAT is saying a lot as he loves to hike and find boxed, he generally doesn't enjoy hanging around at gathers while I exchange and chat!<br/>
Again, thank you Mark and Sue for setting up an event that will long be remembered by The V's.<br/>
I am off to refill my bug spray and Afterbite supply!<br/>

This was one for the record, thanks Mark &amp; Sue for bringing us back to our Roots!<br/>

ever for me.  Just meeting all the letterboxers from New England and other places would have been fun enough, but getting to meet Der Mad Stamper and Tom Cooch was more than I could have hoped for.  At one point I had Tom sitting next to me and DMS across from him as they talked about the early days and how they made letterboxing work here <br/>
in America.  I am still in awe of the people that made this happen, <br/>
and I felt extremely privileged to spend over an hour talking with two of them.  Thanks for indulging this old Texas boy; y'all are the greatest!<br/>
