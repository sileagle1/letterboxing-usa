<br/>
Then as I walked back to my car, I found a Psychomommy walking down the path!  Another great surprise!<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping to hit 100 tomorrow.  I may come within one box anyways!    And while I try, I will find new homes for the two hitchhikers.  Maybe they should stay together.  Maybe Die Uber Frau is plotting World Domination!  Maybe they should be separated so that she can't succeed in her evil plot.<br/>

In the meantime, I am trying to convince her to bake me some cookies!<br/>
