                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ahhh!  This happened to me a few months ago after the<br/>
hubby downloaded something from Address.com.  I was<br/>
trying to get to the letterboxing.org site and was<br/>
constantly rerouted to an x rated site and/or a<br/>
"calendar girl" site.<br/>
<br/>
  I finally received and email from the company whose<br/>
site I was directed to telling me that there was<br/>
something at this Address.com site that infected my<br/>
computer so that instead of getting error messages<br/>
when I couldn't connect to a site it would reroute my<br/>
computer to the site chosen by whomever placed this<br/>
bug at Address.com.  <br/>
Anyhow- I searched my system and found plenty of<br/>
'things' (for lack of a more specific term) relating<br/>
back to Address.com (which I thought I had completely<br/>
deleted from my system using the uninstall function).<br/>
After that I've had no problems whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
Makes ya wonder sometimes.<br/>
