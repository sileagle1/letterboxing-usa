After performing a dance of joy,I preceded to open the treasure chest and examine the contents. What a fabulous wealth of booty it contained! Following the instructions to the letter, I made my mark upon the pages of the log book, along with my roommate who has been dragged kicking and screaming into the wonderful hobby of letterboxing, and a very curious feline friend who wanted to leave his mark as well. (Hence forth, the feline shall be known as "The Black Purr") Thar be one more matey that wishes to get in on the spoiles, then the treasure chest shall be sent on to the next cursed salty dog. The cargo shall make ship tomorrow with UPS, for after that I take sail for warmer climes, and a week of pillaging in the original home of the Black Pearl (Disney World that is).<br/>
