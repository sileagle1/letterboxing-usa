at all) to communicate to the owners of the box that it is gone?  We <br/>
were so excited to have found the spot, and reallllllly sad when we <br/>
found there was nothing there, and the area around where it should <br/>
have been looking pretty abused.  I guess this is a feeling you have <br/>
to get used to with this activity?  I hope it gets better, we plan to <br/>
leave our own in the Marin County area soon :)<br/>
