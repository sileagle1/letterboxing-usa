site to look for the box if you removed it.  We were in the area last <br/>
Monday and Wednesday (1/6 and 1/8)and found COR LIBRI, Soda Jerk, <br/>
Seven from the Florida Ancients (6 found)and Son of Flapjack.  We were <br/>
going to go to DeBary on our way back to Orlando, but it got too dark. <br/>
  The weather was perfect for letterboxing.  Saw several armadillos <br/>
and other wildlife while looking for the Seven Ancients.  What a great <br/>
place!<br/>
  I wish you wouldn't give up on box placement in that part of Florida <br/>
-- we'll be back, as we really enjoyed the area.  Thanks a lot for <br/>
your wonderful boxes!<br/>
