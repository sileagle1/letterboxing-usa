&gt; &gt;Okay 10am at the Park Center.  The Triple V Gang (or at least <br/>
those of us <br/>
&gt; &gt;who don't have to work on Saturday, blech) will deliver Ryan from <br/>
the front <br/>
&gt; &gt;door of his hotel to the pavilion at the parking area.  We are <br/>
hoping to <br/>
&gt; &gt;meet a bunch of you!  Oh AND, in the past HF has had a huge <br/>
beautiful <br/>
&gt; &gt;fireworks display on the Saturday before the 4th so you may want <br/>
to make a <br/>
&gt; &gt;day of it, or maybe we should start later?<br/>

park <br/>
&gt; &gt;center.  It's only $5 per carload and they run very nice shuttle <br/>
buses into <br/>
&gt; &gt;(and back from) Harper's Ferry every 15 minutes. These buses drop <br/>
off at a <br/>
&gt; &gt;nice covered pavillion with benches that could theoretically be <br/>
used for <br/>
&gt; &gt;the exchanges.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   After a very recent trip there I really don't think there <br/>
would be <br/>
&gt; &gt;enough parking for everyone who says they want to attend and a $5 <br/>
donation <br/>
&gt; &gt;per family to the park service for 'hosting' this event would be <br/>
a nice <br/>
&gt; &gt;gesture.   Just a thought.<br/>

&gt; &gt;The Triple V Gang met up with Ryan again last night at the <br/>
Blackburn Trail <br/>
&gt; &gt;Center.  We met lots of cool hikerfolk and had a very enjoyable <br/>
visit.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;Since no decision has been made as to when and where to meet I <br/>
couldn't <br/>
&gt; &gt;give Ryan a time or place but I am set to email him as soon as we <br/>
decide.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;I know that parking is a premium in HF so I'm just not sure where <br/>
the best <br/>
&gt; &gt;place is.  My personal vote is for the AT headquarters but again <br/>
parking <br/>
&gt; &gt;may be an issue.  If we all park down at the river where the <br/>
parking lots <br/>
&gt; &gt;are we could just meet somewhere down there and walk up the hill <br/>
to the <br/>
&gt; &gt;icecream place for refreshments.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;So what does everyone think?  Who else is coming?  10am at the <br/>
parking area <br/>
&gt; &gt;by the river?<br/>

they have<br/>
