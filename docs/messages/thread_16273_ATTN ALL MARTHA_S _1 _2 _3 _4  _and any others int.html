Introducing the  "DAYS OF HER LIFE HH" Postal LB<br/>
<br/>
Now that Martha has little to do, she is a bit confused about time.<br/>
<br/>
I have carved 7 stamps in Martha's honor. She has been counting the <br/>
days and I thought it might be nice to give her something to count <br/>
them by! Should anyone wish to join this HH postal box please email <br/>
me your name and address to:<br/>
<br/>
phynstarrataoldotcom<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I shall send this HH first to Busy Bee with respect to her fantastic <br/>
job on the FREE MARTHA Postal LB!!!  (Thanks BB!) She will then move <br/>
it from there. Each person will be given one week (if they choose) to <br/>
make a small carving or do something of their own choosing. The <br/>
stamps are small and should not cost more then 2$ to send. Please <br/>
feel free to add something special to the HH as time marcheth on for <br/>
dear Martha! Stamps of the craftiest kind are most encouraged!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the interest!! <br/>
