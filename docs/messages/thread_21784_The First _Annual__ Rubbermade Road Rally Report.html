Now that it has been a few weeks and I have acquired some clarity on<br/>
the matter, I wish to <br/>
report that the First (Annual?) Rubbermade Road Rally was a complete<br/>
success.<br/>
Despite torrential rains and local flooding, 11 teams braved the<br/>
deluge to follow a winding <br/>
course through Pennsylvania's Montgomery County collecting 8 boxes<br/>
and who knows how <br/>
many hitchhikers, bonus boxes, cuckoo clues and more.<br/>
<br/>
The Rally had a rocky start with the first date cancelled in February<br/>
and the second date <br/>
planned for a day with the heaviest rains in decades.  After a brutal<br/>
April Fool's joke nearly <br/>
forced a second postponement, 11 of 15 registered teams ran the<br/>
course and proved their <br/>
letterboxing skills.  <br/>
<br/>
The stamps were donated by 'Boxers from the LBMA region and have all<br/>
been returned to <br/>
their owners for re-placement in the world.  One casualty to report,<br/>
Box #1, the "Jeep" <br/>
stamp graciously carved and donated by the MayDay Lillies (who sadly<br/>
could not attend) <br/>
was washed away by the flood.  It was foolishly planted by yours<br/>
truly in an area that was <br/>
covered by about 8 feet of water.<br/>
<br/>
The Road Rally was conceived as a way to string local drive-bys<br/>
together for an event.  <br/>
When that became impractical (we're not in Connecticut, after all)<br/>
the event was <br/>
restructured for new boxes and new placements in easily available<br/>
areas.<br/>
<br/>
You can read more about the Rally on our blog:<br/>
 http://roadrally.blogspot.com/<br/>
<br/>
There is a listing of the winners, awards, times, and rules and<br/>
regulations.<br/>
<br/>
My thanks to the teams for their dedicated participation, patience<br/>
and generosity.  And to <br/>
the talented carvers who made interesting, beautiful, and fun stamps.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to stage a similar event in your area, I would be<br/>
happy to answer any <br/>
questions you might have about how we did it.<br/>
