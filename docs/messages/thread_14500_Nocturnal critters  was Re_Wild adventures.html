&gt; &gt; Well, I do know that if you meet a nocturnal animal moseying about <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the daytime and if it's not because you've disturbed it, then it may<br/>
&gt; &gt; have rabies.  When a raccoon was out one afternoon, we were warned <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; turn around and leave the area until the ranger could assess the<br/>
&gt; &gt; situation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; catbead<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the animal is sick but VERY often it can be a momma out foraging. <br/>
In spring and summer nursing mothers often forage at odd times. It takes a lot <br/>
out of them to provide milk for 4 or 5 babies and they must feed often to keep <br/>
it up. Sometimes too it is a nearly-grown youngster that just doesn't know <br/>
any better.<br/>
<br/>
I urge folks not to jump to conclusions about critters, esp. skunks and <br/>
raccoons and other usually nocturnal critters. Remember, YOU might not always keep <br/>
to a regular sleep schedule. They don't either.<br/>
<br/>
One good example are the skunks at Aquinnah on Martha's Vineyard. They are <br/>
always visible during the day...because they have learned to beg for food from <br/>
humans.<br/>
<br/>
A sick animal almost always looks sick...runny eyes or nose or mouth, <br/>
scraggly or missing or matted fur...pacing in circles... bumping into things or <br/>
falling over. Sometimes they may come near you without noticing you are there. <br/>
Those are the ones to get away from fast and inform authorities about them. <br/>
<br/>
Otherwise I say live and let live. Often rangers, animal control officers or <br/>
police are quick to destroy animals because they figure it is easier to kill <br/>
one raccoon that may or may not be sick than to have humans saying there are <br/>
dangerous animals around and building up public uproar and media-induced panic.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think that these 'panics' are more detrimental to the environment <br/>
and to the human psyche than the occasional sick animal.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, not to preach, but it's the environmental educator in me. I just hate <br/>
to see other creatures suffer unnecessarily.<br/>
<br/>
We have all discovered wonderful outdoor experiences through letterboxing. We <br/>
can teach others how fun and exciting and NOT scary the outdoors can be  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy and WILD boxing!<br/>
