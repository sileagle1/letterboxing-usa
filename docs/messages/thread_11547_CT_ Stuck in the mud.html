                    <div class="plaintext-content">On Thursday afternoon (3/27) Jessie and Small Bear started out a beautiful <br/>
day of boxing at Under the Pines in Mansfield (in great shape). Next, we <br/>
proceeded down route 89 in attempt to finally get the Mount Hope Series. As <br/>
we pulled into the park, we noticed the entrance was just a huge mud pit. We <br/>
made it through that part okay, but as we headed to the left to park, our <br/>
car got STUCK IN THE MUD! A very friendly neighborhood man stopped by and <br/>
offered to pull us out with his friend's tractor, but we decided to just <br/>
call AAA instead. After waiting almost an hour, the tow truck finally <br/>
arrived and had to winch us out all the way from the road (he wouldn't drive <br/>
the truck through the muddy entrance). The winching took about 45 minutes, <br/>
and by that time it was too late to complete the whole Mount Hope Series. We <br/>
did pick up the John Storrs box on the way home as a consolation prize, and <br/>
we launched a new hitchhiker somewhere in the area.<br/>
Today (Friday) was a more successful day of boxing. We went to Goodwin <br/>
Forest and found Chuck's Railroad Crossing and Tree is Me boxes (both in <br/>
good shape). Tree is Me was my 150th find!! Yippee (Jessie is almost there <br/>
at F135). We ended the day with the Forgotten Woodpiles box (also in good <br/>
shape, but the box was right out in the open near the back, all hidden good <br/>
now). Our energy levels were a little low today, otherwise we would have <br/>
attempted Black Spruce Pond, Fairy of the Falls, and Mother Hubbard series. <br/>
Oh well, we'll save those for another day. Be on the lookout for a new box <br/>
from us soon, as well as several hitchhikers being sent out on their way <br/>
sometime soon!<br/>
<br/>
Keep out of the mud!<br/>

able to return soon, once things dry out a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I have had quite a time trying to gather stamps from the Mt. Hope <br/>
series myself. Mid-Jan.: a brutal, cold day, I followed the clues. <br/>
Box #1--no way! Clues not clear to me. Way too much snow.  Box #2: <br/>
Found it! Wedged in place, not to be pried free. I re-visited mid-<br/>
Feb. Still could not find #1 but did stamp in #2. ( I love the <br/>
stamp!!!) While tracking down #3 I came upon a dramatic scene by the <br/>
river: A deer totally torn apart.  I kept eyeing the woods for <br/>
coyotes and illegal hunters. Well, Box #3 was found but it was <br/>
totally encased in ice.  No way would it budge. Mid-March:  yes, I am <br/>
stubborn. Could not figure out where Box #1 is and still could not <br/>
free Box #3.  I found the spot where Box # 4 is, but at that time it <br/>
was still covered by snow. I will try to stay away for yet another <br/>
month!<br/>

  And it's still coming down. (have you ever seen it go up?)<br/>
  I still think mud is bad, horrible, nasty, smelly, slimy, gooey, <br/>
tricky and any other name you can think of. It's only good for making <br/>
pots. SNOW on the other hand I can see and just tells me to stay in, <br/>
have a cup of hot chocolate, light a fire, and watch an old movie or <br/>
read a good book.   <br/>
     But then again if you live in New England and didn't box in the <br/>
snow you'd find very few boxes.<br/>
     BTW it's headed your way!!!!<br/>
