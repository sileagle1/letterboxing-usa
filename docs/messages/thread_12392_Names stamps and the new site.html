                    <div class="plaintext-content">My name is one I have used for several years now.  The Hoopoe is a <br/>
bird of Europe,  Africa and Asia.  It is my most desired simply <br/>
because of its unique character and name.  I use Hoopoe (and a <br/>
variation Poopoe) on several Bulliten Boards.<br/>
<br/>
My signature is animage of a Hoopoe.  My first was taken from Roger <br/>
Tory Petersons "Birds of Europe" my second is a variation on a <br/>
corportate logo.  The first stamp was about 3 x 2 and would sometimes <br/>
be too big for micro boxes.  Then I would just ink up the head of the <br/>
bird and stamp in.  Once on a pair of micro boxes that had stamps <br/>
when put together formed an image I did the same with my stamp, heads <br/>
and tails in two books.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp I currently use is carved on Stadler block so it is extra <br/>
thick and double sided.  On one side the bird picture is about 2x2 <br/>
and the other is my name "hoopoe" about 0.5 x 1.  I can use both <br/>
sides or just one depending on the size of the page and the weather <br/>
conditions ( stamp and run in the rain)<br/>
<br/>
I finally entered my humble boxes in the new site including the <br/>
elusive "Waughop" which never made it to the main page.  I never did <br/>
find it in "whats new" amid all the other boxes that were planted in <br/>
a pre winter flurry of activity.  It was part of the South Puget <br/>
sound Quest Fest and I am sure not missed within the 24 other boxes <br/>
in the park.<br/>
<br/>
Good job Wes , I am sure once everyone gets a hang of the new system <br/>
life will be good.<br/>

was born and raised in South Africa, been here for 6 years now.  We <br/>
have a hoopoe statue in our living room!  Some day we will go back to <br/>
visit and plant some boxes over there too!  ~WingNut_LB~<br/>
