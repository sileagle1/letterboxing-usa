letterboxing, so these clues are quite detailed and descriptive.  Hope you <br/>
get a chance to visit.  It's in an area of MI that has only one other box.  <br/>
I'm hoping to get a few more boxes out there this summer.  Please contact me <br/>
if you search for this box.  I'd like to get some feedback.  Good luck!  <br/>

The Great Lakes state has literally thousands of miles of coastline.  The <br/>
Lake Huron shore, on the east side of the state, is lined with bustling port <br/>
cities and quaint small towns, and has a rich history in the maritime and <br/>
logging industries.  The area is often referred to as the "sunrise side" of <br/>
the state and has many spectacular views. The Michigan's "East Coast" Cruise <br/>
description at scenicdrivesonline.com provides a nice overview of towns and <br/>
sights along Lake Huron: <br/>

The Huron Greenways website contains wonderful descriptions of area geology, <br/>
ecosystems, and points of interest, supplemented with maps and photos.  The <br/>
website can be accessed through the following address:<br/>

The letterbox is located in the Besser Natural Area, approx. 14 miles north <br/>
of Alpena.  It is a beautiful tract of land that includes Lake Huron <br/>
shoreline, a virgin stand of white pine, and ruins of a 1880s abandoned <br/>
logging village.  The Besser Natural Area entrance is located on Grand Lake <br/>
Road (County Highway 405), between the crossroads of County Highway 638 and <br/>
Route US-23.  It is south of the town of Presque Isle.  Don't forget to leave <br/>
some time in your schedule to visit both of the Presque Isle lighthouses.<br/>
