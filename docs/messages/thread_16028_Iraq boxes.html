some fun to Iraq for Newbel and the others there. It sure isn't home <br/>
but there's no reason they can't have some fun and relaxation while <br/>
they are in the most stressful place I can think of!  We are proud of <br/>
all those who serve , our nation can't thank you enough for standing <br/>
up and making a difference. Be watching the post for all our combined <br/>
wishes to you and those you serve with. Leader of the Pack - Carol<br/>
