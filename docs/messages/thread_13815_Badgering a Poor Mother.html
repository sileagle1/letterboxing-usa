<br/>
I have heard of being avid for clues but I want to report the <br/>
neferious goings on being perpetrated by a certain JugglerMouse. To <br/>
wit, on Monday Ash Raven and I gathered up a lovely and lively lady, <br/>
Pat M., who happens to be the mother of Ms. Mouse. We took her out <br/>
for a planting of Treebeard the Ent, the eleventh box in my Middle <br/>
Earth series.<br/>
<br/>
That evening I had the misfortune to shatter a wisdom tooth. I have <br/>
not yet encoded the clues (in Futhark) for Treebeard yet. Can you <br/>
blame me? "Oh, the pain, the pain!" -- Dr. Smith in Lost in Space.<br/>
<br/>
So we have a box planted on Monday and on Tuesday what does Ms. <br/>
Juggler-badgering-Mouse do? She calls her mother and says that Sir <br/>
Balthazar (she often calls me Speedo but my real name is Mr. Earl) <br/>
has forgotten the directions to the box and could her aged mother (I <br/>
swear she is such a beauty that you would poison your own parents <br/>
just to have her adopt you) tell Ms. Mouse where the box is so she <br/>
could relay that to Sir Balthazar? Right. Well, her mother is smart <br/>
enough to have survived raising such a child and of course refused to <br/>
tell her. <br/>
<br/>
Can you fathom the depths of depravity that this serpent's tooth of a <br/>
child could reach? I mean, trying to trick her mother? What kind of <br/>
child is that? I, for one, would NEVER lie to my mom. I am sure none <br/>
of you out there would either.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow still I love Ms JugglerMouse. I just have to be careful <br/>
around her: she juggles knives, too.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, JugglerMouse carved the Treebeard stamp for me and it is her <br/>
best so far.<br/>

I was WITH Sir Balthazar the Badger on Monday after he discovered his <br/>
tooth issue.  He was writhing in pain, and there was every reason for <br/>
me to believe at that time that he might not survive long enough to <br/>
place the clues to the box that he had planted earlier.<br/>
<br/>
In a worst-case-scenario,  I reasoned that it would not be socially <br/>
appropriate for me to contact Ash Raven, the grieving daughter, to <br/>
ask her for clues to the box so that I could post them for the rest <br/>
of the community.  My Aged Mother's memory may be starting to go- so <br/>
I figured I had better strike while the iron was hot and ask her <br/>
right away for her help locating the box while it was fresh in her <br/>
mind.  The small deception on my part was only because I did not want <br/>
to worry her prematurely about Balthazar's grave condition.<br/>
<br/>
Did I do so wrong?  I wanted only to be sure that this new box wasn't <br/>
lost to the ages, and could stand as a tribute to Balthazar that we <br/>
could all enjoy.  And yet, it seems, that everyone always thinks the <br/>
worst of a mouse's motives.<br/>
<br/>
It's all right, don't bother apologizing.  I am used to it.<br/>

dear little pandora has left the SLO area and migrated to Portland OR where<br/>
due to her still agitated broken ankle (received of course doing none other<br/>
than letterboxing) she still cannot begin to start racking up the numbers on<br/>
the numerous letterboxes hidden in the Portland area she sits shaking her<br/>
head thinking that upon her absences the members of Googled (which she is<br/>
forever a member of she hears -- I believe it was stated something along the<br/>
lines of "You can check out anytime you like but you can never leave" (A<br/>
very bad and cringing line from Hotel California) have now begun yet another<br/>
new and exciting letterboxing tradition..... soap operas.  I will now<br/>
forever be referring to the SLO area of California as the "As the world<br/>
turns of the letterboxing world"<br/>
<br/>
Hugs going out to the Googled members. I hope you survive that terrible<br/>
experience with the wisdom tooth Sir Balthazar and I hope you get over the<br/>
emotional dilemma of such accusations against your character dear Ms<br/>
Mouse... in the mean time I will be staying tune for the next episode.<br/>
