site! A humonguous thank you to all who contributed as well as to the<br/>
letterboxing community as a whole for being so patient as we gathered,<br/>
planted, and tested -- and tested some more! -- 24 stamps.<br/>
<br/>
The Richmond club is offering a prize to the first boxer who can prove<br/>
to us that he/she found all 24 stamps in all 4 parks. You'll have to<br/>
send us an electronic scan or a fax showing all 24 stamps. When you<br/>
think you've found all 24, let us know. The prize hasn't been<br/>
finalized, but it will definitely be boxing related.<br/>
<br/>
Questions, comments, and contest entries can be sent via e-mail to any<br/>
of the planners listed in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
