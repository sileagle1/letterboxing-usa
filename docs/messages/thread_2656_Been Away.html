all the info on Home is where the heart is we had fun planting it <br/>
and  Cowboy will be interested to hear where it has gone.<br/>
  I replied off line to Wingfoot re: his Mansfield Travels hope to <br/>
meet up with him but I'm on my way soon to New York. <br/>
  Went to Vermont and got a Valley Quest box at Queechee Gorge .. <br/>
excellent!Wish I had time for more it made me crazy knowing how close <br/>
I was to all of them. Another trip this summer for boxes only!<br/>
   I didn't even get to plant one and had one along for that purpose. <br/>
Well that will wait for the next trip.  <br/>
  Next stop Cowboy and I are off to New York and will post clues when <br/>
I get back , can't wait. This trip is  on my agenda.<br/>
