 I'm just worried about putting<br/>
&gt; DEET on my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, I understand this--I tend to be a very cautious medical<br/>
consumer; I selectively vaccinate, use homeopathic in place of<br/>
pharmaceuticals when appropriate, use natural soaps etc.  You have received<br/>
some great links, and I would suggest talking to your doctor and doing a bit<br/>
of research yourself.<br/>
I choose to use bug spray both on my children and myself, simply because<br/>
several of us are extremely sensitive to bug bites and I am not always<br/>
conscientious about checking my three squirmy children as quickly as I would<br/>
like. A Every so often, the day stretches long, they fall asleep in the van<br/>
and get dumped, grimy and all, into bed.   When I am only boxing with one, I<br/>
seldom use spray as I find I can usually do a good inspection.<br/>

I'm not sure about ticks, but that Avon skin so soft lotion works <br/>
fabulous for mosquitos. I bought some last summer to give it my own <br/>
test after hearing about it for years. We never ended up needing it <br/>
after I bought it, but I brought it back out this summer and used it <br/>
when we went camping. There were mosquitos galore. The first day I <br/>
used Off spray with deet and then decided to give the skin so soft a <br/>
try. The mosquitos would come close and then as soon as they smelled <br/>
it they would fly away. My kids were actually running around with <br/>
their arms up to the mosquitos chasing them away. It was a funny <br/>
sight. They have, what I think is called Bug Plus that has a better <br/>
odor than the original skin so soft lotion. It's safe for any age <br/>
children and it says you don't have to worry about washing it off <br/>
when the day is done. And it dosn't accidentally get sprayed in your <br/>
eyes or mouth like the deet sprays. Just a suggestion.<br/>
