Hum! I bet you eat a lot of popcorn. You must live in the northern <br/>
part of the state. Your state does have a National Forest, called <br/>
Hoosier National Forest. So, what is a "Hoosier"?  Parke Co. claims <br/>
to have more than 30 covered bridges, great place to hide some boxes <br/>
when the weather warms up. And isn't there one of the largest caves  <br/>
in the US, somewhere in the southern end of the state. Pretty state <br/>
from 30,000 ft up in the air. <br/>
<br/>
Now,if you need a vacation from that long winter then I suggest that <br/>
you head to Maui,and look for Funhog's King Highway letterbox. The <br/>
kings highway will make you appriciate Indiana. Also,go snorkeling!<br/>

Try asking for  help at a local Agriculture Education Center in a <br/>
local high school. They have Natural Resources teachers . They are <br/>
where the FFA  kids  get their classes so if you see a Blue and Gold <br/>
Jacket ask where they go to school. <br/>
    You could also ask a forester, people who work in the woods <br/>
usually have compass experience. <br/>
    Third just go back and try again, slow down and think about each <br/>
step and it should come to you... Leader of the Pack<br/>

It cleared things up for me - and I didn't have anyone to show me how to use<br/>

If you type in "map and compass" at Amazon you'll find the above book and a<br/>
couple of others that may help.<br/>

You did take the magnetic declination into account, right?  Although in<br/>
Indiana it can't be too significant.  Most people make the mistake of<br/>
subtracting the declination when they should be adding, or vice-versa.  That<br/>
can really throw you off.<br/>
