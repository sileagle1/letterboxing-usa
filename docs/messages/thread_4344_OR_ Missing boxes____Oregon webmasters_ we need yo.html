some time ago, but it simply wasn't there.  We sent a note to Mitch, <br/>
but didn't hear back.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the 2nd box in his Sylvania Campus series is also gone!<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, our own Terrestrial Gastropod series has been retired from <br/>
the Noble Woods Park, in Aloha.  Both boxes got washed away in the <br/>
recent flooding, and the park is a muddy mess.  There just isn't <br/>
enough cover in the winter to host these boxes, so we will be finding <br/>
an alternative home for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Oregon webmasters, we need your help!  Please remove the Terrestrial <br/>
Gastropod series clues from the Letterboxing NA site or put up a <br/>
message indicating they are missing.  Also, we need confirmations and <br/>
messages on the other missing boxes too please.<br/>
<br/>
thx,<br/>

&gt; Checked up on the Greenway Park letterbox, and I'm pretty sure it's <br/>
&gt; missing.  Found it once before, so I know where it's supposed to <br/>
be, <br/>
&gt; but I'm not entirely sure it's not somewhere in the area.  *shrug*  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Willard's Elephant box of the zoo is also missing.  That box is <br/>
&gt; definitely AWOL.<br/>

&gt; Umm....  I think that's all I'll check this week.  =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, maybe not.  Still a few more I intend to find!<br/>
