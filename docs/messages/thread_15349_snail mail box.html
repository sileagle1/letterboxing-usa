e-mailed Scoutdogs to see if anyone wanted to be added to the address list--I <br/>
remember seeing some new members asking about it.  I'm guessing she's on <br/>
vacation because I haven't yet heard back from her.  So I'm taking the initiative <br/>
and asking you directly: <br/>
<br/>
If you want to receive the Snail Mail Letterbox in the mail, and are not <br/>
already on the list that comes with the box, please e-mail me OFF-LIST at pnwexplr <br/>
at aol.com (you want to e-mail only me, not the list, so that your address is <br/>
not announced to the world).  I'll hold the box only a day or two longer--not <br/>
wind nor rain nor dark of night will keep Snail Mail from its appointed <br/>
rounds!<br/>
