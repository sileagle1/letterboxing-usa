We assume that the person mailing it to the next person pays for postage, <br/>
right? But do you actually put it in a box? In a mailing envelope? DO you include <br/>
mailing labels for everyone on the list? <br/>
Each person pays for his or her own mailing. Adding a few cents for "Delivery <br/>
Confirmation" lets you track when it gets there. Most are mailed in a padded <br/>
envelope as they're easier to come by and it's usually easier to mail them if <br/>
you're the type who just throws stamps on them and flip them in the big blue <br/>
box on the street corner. )I always find it hard to find the right size box.) <br/>
There was one PLB going around though that is simply the clear Tupperware <br/>
letterbox itself wrapped up with tape. You can see what's in it and everything! <br/>
Kinda cool. <br/>
<br/>
As for address labels, just enclose the list of names and addresses and the <br/>
person receiving the PLB will mail it to the next one on the list. We don't <br/>
want all the work to be on the back of the one making the PLB possible! We lucky <br/>
receivers have to do some work for our good fortune!<br/>
<br/>
Keep on. . .<br/>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br/>
but good impressions. Sir B<br/>

piority mail box, with a request to send boxes priority mail with tracking. One <br/>
box sent $2  a day or two before I got the box for the cost of the tracking. <br/>
That really wasn't necassary, but thoughtful.  If you are on a PLB list you <br/>
should expect to pay for postage &amp; get the box off quickly.  That's my opinion.<br/>
