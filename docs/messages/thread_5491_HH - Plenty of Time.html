<br/>
There's a brand new hitchhiker now out and about. It's called "Plenty of <br/>
Time" and was planted by my good buddy Sugarmaker and me on May 25th during <br/>
our two-day letterboxing/baseball road trip.<br/>
<br/>
As you will see if you find it, there's a certain timeless quality about this <br/>
hitchhiker; sadly, though, it hasn't had a date in years. So please treat it <br/>
kindly and be sure it's given a good home. <br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Alan from Axtown<br/>
