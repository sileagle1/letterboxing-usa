                    <div class="plaintext-content">On  February 17, 2002 Funhog placed the Rookery Letterbox near <br/>
Vancouver, Clark County, Washington. The search for this letterbox is a <br/>
short stroll but along the way you will see one of the largest Great <br/>
Blue Heron rookeries in the area. It's especially enjoyable to go here <br/>
in late winter or early spring. At his time the herons are already on <br/>
the nest and the bare trees allow for easy viewing. Bring those <br/>
binoculars!<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: From I-5 take the Fourth Plain exit #1. Go west on <br/>
Fourth Plain/501 to the entrance for Vancouver Lake Park. Drive past <br/>
the entrance .4 miles to a turnout where you can park your car. This is <br/>
right at the end of two guardrails.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: Go through the stile on the west side of the road. <br/>
Take a compass bearing of 200 degrees magnetic and head out across the <br/>
field. You will have to skirt around some fallen wood at the beginning. <br/>
Keep walking until you come to four upright 4X6 posts. From this point <br/>
you have a great view of the rookery up high in the trees almost due <br/>
south. After you've seen these huge nests set your compass for forty <br/>
five degrees and walk about 150 steps to the letterbox.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On May 24, 2002 Funhog placed the Dog Mountain letterbox near the town <br/>
of Carson, Skamania County, WA. This hike will take you to one of the <br/>
premier wildflower viewing sites in this region. It isn't an easy hike, <br/>
gaining about 2500 feet in three miles but the meadows at the top are <br/>
so spectacular when they are in bloom that I can just about guarantee <br/>
that you will want to come back next year. At the summit you are also <br/>
given glorious views of the Columbia River Gorge, Mount Hood, Mount St. <br/>
Helens and Mount Adams. I have decided that the mountain received its <br/>
name because you are dog tired by the end of the six miles. Don't <br/>
forget, bring plenty of water!<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: From Vancouver WA go east on Highway 14. Just past <br/>
mile marker 53 you will find the Dog Mountain parking area on the north <br/>
side of the road. The trailhead is just right of the pay station where <br/>
you need to buy a day pass if you don't have an annual Forest Pass. <br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Head for the summit. After about half a mile there is <br/>
a fork in the trail. The one to the left is .2 miles shorter, through <br/>
the woods and a bit steeper. The one to the right is slightly more <br/>
scenic, with occassional views of the gorge. The choice is yours. You <br/>
will be panting either way.  Once you emerge from the forest you will <br/>
be in a steep, expansive meadow of Balsamroot, Paintbrush, Delphinium, <br/>
Lupine and a gazillion other flowers. When you come to the first <br/>
switchback you will be at a viewpoint known as Puppy Point. Paws here <br/>
and drool over the vista. Lap up some of that water you brought along <br/>
and contemplate the fork in the tail (oops trail.) One direction takes <br/>
you to the summit through the meadow, one through the forest. Trot down <br/>
toward the trees if you want to sniff out the letterbox. Just after you <br/>
enter the forest look to the left for a pair of brothers, arms <br/>
entwined. Twenty steps behind them at 330 degrees magnetic is a third <br/>
littermate with its foot upon the letterbox which is curled up beside a <br/>
whitish rock. If you don't bark up the wrong tree, you will be sure to <br/>
wag your tail. Go fetch!<br/>
