<br/>
I'm brand new to letterboxing, in fact I haven't even been out yet.  I read <br/>
the recent article in Family Fun and was very interested.  I started surfing <br/>
the web to see if I could find some boxes near me and found a few at lbNA.  <br/>
I nearly ran out immediately to try to find them but the weather has been <br/>
pretty crummy.  I am sorry I waited, because I joined this group yesterday <br/>
and am now a little nervous to start.  It seems that there is definitely a <br/>
right way and a wrong way to do things and I don't want to upset any of the <br/>
people who have been doing this for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I digress. I read the FAQs and saw that most of the clues for the <br/>
boxes are listed at lbNA but that sometimes finding the clues is part of the <br/>
fun in itself.  Soon I will be visiting my parents in the Albany, NY area <br/>
and was wondering if anyone knew of any boxes I might be able to look for.  <br/>
I saw the one listed for Glenville, NY but I'm not sure I want to start with <br/>
a box listed as abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Ellen<br/>

The Glenville, NY box could still be there but the person who placed<br/>
it may not be aware of the LbNA change, or may no longer be interested<br/>
in letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
What state and city are you from?<br/>

Abandoned boxes simply mean that the individual who planted the letterbox <br/>
has not yet "claimed" it on the revamped letterboxing.org web site. The <br/>
person could be an avid letterboxer who doesn't follow this list, but who <br/>
may maintain their own boxes quite diligently.<br/>
<br/>
A better term to describe it would be "unclaimed," in fact. I wouldn't <br/>
necessarily avoid any box listed as "abandoned" on the web site.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Ellen!  Concerning the abandoned box, that simply means that the box has <br/>
not been picked up by the placer on the website.  Many of the placers have <br/>
found out about the new site and have signed up, whereas others may not have, or <br/>
may not be boxing anymore.  Don't let that discourage you from looking!  We <br/>
have a famous abandoned box here in CT (Ray's Dilemma), which is still alive and <br/>
well, even though it is technically abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
Don't let an "abandoned" box discourage you from looking!  Go out and have <br/>
some fun!<br/>
