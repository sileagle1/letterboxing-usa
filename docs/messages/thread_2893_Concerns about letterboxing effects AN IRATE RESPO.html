So, I agree with Bill. Perhaps Joe-Self-Righteous aught to give at <br/>

or else close off all parks completely because, obviously, humans <br/>
just do damage to natural lands. But oh, no, that would jeapardize <br/>
the Park Department funding and he may find himself a victim <br/>
of downsizing.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps now is time to come out of the closet and write to our <br/>
senators introducing them to letterboxing the nice way before they <br/>
hear about from some paranoid park ranger (this is a general <br/>
statement and not directed specifically at Mr. Gilbert or any other <br/>
individual employed by any federal or state agency).<br/>

&gt;!<br/>
&gt;Date: Sat, 21 Jul 2001 03:52:40 -0000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In response to Mr Gilberts comments about letterboxing and<br/>
&gt;Geo-Caching, I offer the following. It is truly unfortunate that an<br/>
&gt;apparent official of the National Park Service would use his<br/>
&gt;office as a "Bully Pulpit" in a blatant attempt to discredit an<br/>
&gt;activity simply because it doesn't fit his idea of traditional trail<br/>
&gt;use.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From the article -<br/>
&gt;"...It is doubtful that existing management plans or regulations for<br/>
&gt;any public lands provide for this type of activity. Therefore,<br/>
&gt;participation in geocaching or letterboxing could make one subject<br/>
&gt;to law enforcement actions regarding unauthorized use of public<br/>
&gt;lands. ...."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Does he mean that hiking in the woods was not planned for ? Just<br/>
&gt;exactly what should we be charged with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From the article -<br/>
&gt;"...Critical nesting/breeding areas of threatened or endangered<br/>
&gt;animals might be disturbed. Fragile plant communities could be<br/>
&gt;trampled. If the cache or letterbox is buried, archeological<br/>
&gt;resources could be damaged. ..."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Apparently this gentleman is under the impression that the<br/>
&gt;letterboxing community is comprised of an inordinate amount<br/>
&gt;of careless people and idiots who have no concern for the environment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From the article -<br/>
&gt;"... Leaving something behind has always been viewed as "littering."<br/>
&gt;Geocaching and letterboxing invite a redefinition of that term and of<br/>
&gt;basic trail ethics. Thus, I see them as being at cross-purposes with<br/>
&gt;the effort to instill in the public's mind a greater appreciation<br/>
&gt;for outdoor use and land stewardship ethics. ..."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pure Sanctimonious Self Serving Drivel ! Even my dog packs out all<br/>
&gt;the garbage that just those plain old hikers leave behind. Anything<br/>
&gt;that a good  letterboxer leaves behind is carefully hidden so there<br/>
&gt;is no visible trace and no environmaental damage. The areas<br/>
&gt;are cleaner than when they were first found and the traffic loading<br/>
&gt;is minimal since it's not done in major hoards. The support for<br/>
&gt;"Orienteering" events having less impact is laughable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Letterboxing is a hike with a destination in mind - The assumption<br/>
&gt;that a predetermined destination can have an impact on the trail<br/>
&gt;simply doesn't equate. It seems a shame that many who attain positions<br/>
&gt;of notice often use it for personal goals. Perhaps Mr. Gilbert needs<br/>
&gt;a crusade. Why don't we work on something more productive. I for<br/>
&gt;one find no merit in his comments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This article made me so mad I could just SPIT !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OK. I'm mad and I vented - You think I'm wrong ? Flame Away !<br/>
