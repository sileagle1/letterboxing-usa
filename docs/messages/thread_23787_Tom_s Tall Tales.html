month ago. They proudly showed me their logbook and told me about <br/>
some of their favorite hunts, including one called Tom's Tall Tales. <br/>
(I got hooked after one day of tagging along with them and had <br/>
myself a hand carved stamp that same weekend. We go boxing together <br/>
now, and it's really nice to have a hobby that I can share with <br/>
the 'rents as an adult.) but I did need to go back and collect the <br/>
boxes that they had gotten before I started. So I dragged another <br/>
friend with me and we went to find Tom's Tall Tales. <br/>
<br/>
We found the box, right where it was supposed to be with it's lovely <br/>
stamp. I knew what it was going to look like, but it was still a joy <br/>
to hold in my hand and stamp in my own book. I love seeing who else <br/>
has been to that particular box and the feeling that i kind of know <br/>
these people, through their stamps and the places they have been. <br/>
That particular day I was also able to revel in how much activity <br/>
the box had seen since my dad had stamped in just two weeks before. <br/>
<br/>
The box was placed in a cemetary and was named after an older <br/>
brother who had spooked his kid sister with scary stories about the <br/>
cemetary as kids. So I was touched to see that Tom had found his <br/>
sister's box and left her a message. <br/>
<br/>
Goose Chaser placed this box along with many others in the eastern <br/>
iowa/western Illinois area. I've just started, but at least 75% of <br/>
my finds are Goose Chaser boxes. I found out this afternoon that <br/>
Goose Chaser died in an motorcycle accident on August 13th. Her real <br/>
name was Paula Egolf. <br/>
<br/>
I've already talked with my parents about adopting her boxes, and <br/>
perhaps placing a memorial box, maybe with the girl scout troups she <br/>
led and introduced to letterboxing. but tonight, things are too <br/>
fresh. I feel like I have lost my letterboxing mentor, a woman who I <br/>
felt I knew, but had never met. She was also a member of this list, <br/>
and i wasn't sure if anyone else knew her or her letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
in a few days I'm sure I'll be full of questions for how one goes <br/>
about adopting boxes, but tonight all I can think about is the <br/>
message her brother left in the Tom's Tall Tales logbook.   <br/>
<br/>
"Fly away home, Goose Chaser."<br/>
