                    <html><body>I have had a great couple of days letterboxing since Christmas!  On Christmas Day, I had only 30 minutes or so (I was on the way to my mom's house in the AM to open presents) to find Devil's Ring of Supersonic Steel, and I also checked up on one of my boxes, finding the Vagabond Vulture Hitchhiker in my box!  
<br/>
<br/>On Friday, I tagged along with Bluebird and Butterfly to find the Metamorphasis and Evergreen Series', Valentine, Harley's Hex, Jordan's Mill, Marathon Men, and the first of the Fowler-Grindstone series.  If any of you would like to do the Fowler-Grindstone series, do it in summer when you want to get your feet wet due to the hot weather!  If you read the clues, you will know what I mean!  We will go back when there is no snow and hot weather!  
<br/>
<br/>On Saturday, I only had time for two boxes, both in Cornwall: The Claddaugh, and the Cunningham Tower.  Letterboxer2002 graced me with his presence and was probably cursing up the hill, while I was holding him up.  Anyway, I'm going to post this before he does:  ok... I admit it, I got into a fight with a tree, and lost.  :-)  practically crawled my way up the mountain since I was too short to get my feet up on some of the large rocks I had to climb on the trail, and all of a sudden, I fell down while standing, admiring the view (my right ankle gave out underneath me).  I felt so stupid, but I did have fun sliding down about 15 feet of rocks on the trail, since they were quite slippery.  They actually looked like a slide, so I slid down.  You should have heard the squeals of delight!  Alan suddenly thought he was hiking with a small child... oh well.... you have to have fun like a child sometimes!
<br/>
<br/>On Sunday, I met up with Butterfly again at Rocky Neck and found all 20 boxes there!  We heard through the grapevine that there was a 20th box there, then a certain boxer told me some cryptic clues on how to get it, but we couldn't find it.  Just so Butterfly could get this stamp, I called this certain boxer on his cell and he happened to be near Rocky Neck, so he came out and searched with us.  We found the box, called Tribal Revenge!  I then left Butterfly and this certain boxer, and went on to the Box with No Name, another mystery box.  BTW.... yes, there ARE 20 boxes there!  Go find your clues!
<br/>
<br/>Today, I may get out to do some boxing, may not.... I'm so tired from the last couple of days, that I could sleep for a week!
<br/>
<br/>Happy Trails and Happy New Year to everyone!
