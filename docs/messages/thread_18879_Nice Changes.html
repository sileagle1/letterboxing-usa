It sounds a lot like another "techy" website, and take note that they <br/>
talk about how it might contain spoilers.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the best way to go about this is replying tot he box owner <br/>
with your sit-reps and the box owner taking the responsibility of <br/>
putting a line at the bottom "last found 5/1/04" or similar. <br/>

I believe this would be the same as the databases that have been <br/>
hashed/rehashed/flamed and disliked by some of the "placers". <br/>
Hopefully this particular concept has been put to bed! The option to <br/>
this is for finders to use "Contact the Placer" with information and <br/>
the placer can update the clue sheet at their discretion.<br/>

<br/>
As far as the ability to mark the boxes that you've already found online, that is implemented at my site.  I also have a contact the<br/>
placer function (As does the LbNA site) and I agree with everyone here.. Allowing for generic comments to be made about a letterbox<br/>
is allowing for people to make mistakes and to post something that they shouldn't.  That doesn't mean that people don't go do it<br/>
elsewhere (Which was where some of the other Databases and Forums came from) and it doesn't mean that they won't continue to do it<br/>
elsewhere, but I want to make sure you realize this.  The Database at the WoL website does NOT allow for people to leave random<br/>
unsubstantiated "It's lost" comments about any letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line to remember when making comments about another's box is simply this.  It's not your box and unless the owner of that<br/>
box as given explicit instructions that you can blab away about their box, don't.  Period.  Don't make comments about you think it's<br/>
lost, don't make comments about where it's at, nothing.<br/>
