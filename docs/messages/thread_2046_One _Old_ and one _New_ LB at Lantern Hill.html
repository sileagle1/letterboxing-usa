                    <div class="plaintext-content">My husband took the day off due to the "blizzard" but after a few hours of<br/>
being housebound decided to take off to Lantern Hill to replace the damaged<br/>
Tribal Nation letterbox that we rescued on Sunday before the snow started.  The<br/>
LB is in its original position but has a new logbook and container.  He wanted<br/>
to make sure that it was back in place for the EMS LB hike scheduled there for<br/>
this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
He took advantage of the occasion to place a new box that he had been planning<br/>
called "Panic."  Lantern Hill has long been one of our favorite hiking places<br/>
and Fred knows numerous ways to climb it.  He has been doing this particular<br/>
route for over 30 years (boy is he old!) and wanted to share it with everyone. <br/>
<br/>
WARNING!!!  My husband is not your typical hiker and this is not an easy route.<br/>
 Although he has done this route many times over the years (even with our<br/>
oldest two when they were 4 and 6) he has never done it with 10" of snow over<br/>
ice.  Even he admits to a moment of "Panic" on his way up to place the box.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy this route, one of our favorites, up an old favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Trish<br/>

Wow!  You weren't kidding.  This route was tough in the snow.  Panic is a<br/>
very appropiate name for this box.  I had a few moments of panic on the way<br/>
up.  And maybe a minor heart attack too!!!  Then, once we got there, we<br/>
realized we didn't have our stamps :(  We signed in anyway, and maybe we'll<br/>
go back in dryer weather to add our stamps and re-stamp your stamp.  It was<br/>
kind of tough w/out a stamp pad, but we huffed some hot breath on it and got<br/>
a light image for our book.  The views though, were unbelievable!  Then, as<br/>
we hiked back down the snow covered Narragansett trail we saw a beautiful<br/>
sunset, pinkish-orange sky, and then a huge almost-full moon casting our<br/>
moon shadows on the snow.  Thanks for another great (and challenging)<br/>
letterbox.<br/>

P.S.-  We are dying to know who else tried this one today.  We saw other<br/>
footprints (fresh from today)  heading toward the trail at the bottom and<br/>
top.  Whoever you are, you were probably smarter than us!!  :)<br/>

Fred placed the box on Tuesday at about 4:30 so those could have been <br/>
his dainty size 14 footprints (the big clue).  Was my warning <br/>
adequate?  Fred was impressed with your tenacity and foolhardiness.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the stamp pad.  I don't usually put them in because I can <br/>
get everything else at Wal-Mart and Staples but would have to brave <br/>
the traffic and congestion at Rt 2 by the malls to get the stamp <br/>
pads.  That section of Rt 2 truly represents the worst in RI...  Now <br/>
that you know where the trail comes out at the top you can always go <br/>
the easier way down to the box to stamp in.<br/>

Yes, your warning was adaquate.  Normally we are well prepared with extra<br/>
stamps pads etc..., but we left our backpack behind due to the steepness of<br/>
the hike, so the extra ink pads, as well as our stamps were forgotten in our<br/>
crazy quest to the top.  We will definitely return in snow-free weather to<br/>
re-stamp.  Hey, maybe we'll take the same path.  I'm sure minus the snow, it<br/>
would be a little more do-able.  Good luck to others on this one.  It's<br/>
tough but worth the views!<br/>
