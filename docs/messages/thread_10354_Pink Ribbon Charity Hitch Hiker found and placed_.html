<br/>
Seekyr, Blaze, and Mobius found the Pink Ribbon Charity Hitch Hiker <br/>
at the Tree For All Seasons letterbox while we were collecting the <br/>
winter version of this stamp.  We released the Lost Luggage Hitch <br/>
Hiker when we were there in the fall so it was fun to find a new one <br/>
when we returned yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The Pink Ribbon Hitch Hiker is a charity hitch hiker released by the <br/>
Green Dragon Team who ask that the journeys of this hitch hiker be <br/>
made public including where it is next released.  Team Green Dragon <br/>
will be making a donation to the American Breast Cancer Foundation <br/>
as the hitch hiker makes its journey.  Great idea, Team Dragon, for <br/>
a great cause.<br/>
<br/>
We brought the Pink Ribbon HH with us to the MA Winter Gathering at <br/>
Moose Hill (Thanks Rustypuff and CSCM; we had a wonderful time!!) <br/>
where it gathered 22 more stamps.  It's now hiding with the turkey <br/>
at the Turkey Trot LB in Havard, MA.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Seeky, Blaze, and Mobius<br/>

We had way too much fun at the winter gathering.<br/>
Moose Hill Sanctuary is beautiful as is the nature center.<br/>
It was fantastic to meet other people who share our <br/>
enthusiasm and understand our desire to "get out there"<br/>
(unlike our friends and family members who say things like<br/>
"WHAT???? Are you guys nuts?? You're going hiking in THAT??!".<br/>
<br/>
We took Wanda's advice and did some of her and Pete's boxes <br/>
in Charlestown, RI on Sunday (and we're rewarded with a<br/>
"Swift Passage")<br/>
<br/>
And we noticed that Alan visited the "Frosty Drew" (we probably <br/>
just missed you - we were looking for your car ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the update on the pink ribbon HH.<br/>
We thought the "Turkey Trot" was very fun.<br/>
(I'm glad he got away)<br/>
