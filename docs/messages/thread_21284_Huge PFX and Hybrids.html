Hi Doc -<br/>
<br/>
Your hybrid series sounds fantastic and, with your permission, I may<br/>
be steal portions of it for some boxes here in the Great Lakes region<br/>
once the glaciers of our current ice age retreat. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to comment on this PFX count of yours:<br/>
 &gt; F4734 P366 X304 HH144 &lt; <br/>
Geez oh pizza, what amazing stories must be behind those numbers!  How<br/>
long have you been boxing?  Let me say THANK YOU for placing so many<br/>
boxes. If it weren't for Placers, there would be nothing for the<br/>
Finders to seek. Also, I'm one of those goofus types who thinks high<br/>
"F" counts are far more impressive if the "P" count is up there too. <br/>
How in the world to you keep track of 330+ though? Between my posted<br/>
boxes, WOM and Virtuals I have around 75 and sometimes find it a<br/>
challenge to do maintance.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

&gt; Back in 2001 I did a cross Geo/Letterbox.  I placed 11 total boxes.<br/>
The first 10 boxes had anywhere between 4-6 word stamps. You printed<br/>
out a sheet with numbers on it and went on your way. Each box had GPS<br/>
waypoint and Letterbox Clues. Each stamp in each box had numbers on<br/>
the back. You stamped that stamp on each number on the sheet you<br/>
printed out. When you found all 10 boxes the sheet was a letterbox<br/>
clue to get the 11th box or (cache with goodies) At the end of 2003 I<br/>
had 103 Geocachers and 86 Letterboxers do the 11 boxes.<br/>
