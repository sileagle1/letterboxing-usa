the first paragraph is the same.<br/>

Come to Willimantic and turn onto Mansfield Ave. Follow that to Oak Hill dr. and you have found our neighborhood. You will see the parking places.<br/>
Welcome to Sweeney School . Starting at the flagpole in the front of the building .( please take a minute to admire our Bright Blue sign) walk across the driveway and follow the windows past the classrooms and round the bend ( you will see our 4th grade portables) Walk around  the back where you see the new Middle School on the hill. Pass over the world and North America ..we stopped in Italy. Don't let the giant caterpillar eat your clues. WE came around another corner to the primary wing's playground. We sat a spell and imagined the kids having fun during recess. After a short rest we headed back to the front of the building along the tarred pathway past the dated cornerstone( we recently celebrated our 40th birthday)Now look for some ancient tracks  left long ago by an "Eubrontes" near the front entrance. Your leterbox wil be under the sign. Please  stamp in and leave the students a message  as they will be checking the log  book. Tell us where you are from . Thanks  <br/>
