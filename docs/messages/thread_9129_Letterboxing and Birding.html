Park in Fremont, CA is an excellent area for bird watching. The park  <br/>
which has a big marsh is located close to the Alameda Creek and the <br/>
bay, so natural it attracts many different types of beautiful <br/>
waterfowl.  My Alameda Creek Trail series is located there. I am <br/>
planning on another series for that area sometime in the near future. <br/>
