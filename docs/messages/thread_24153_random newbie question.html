You know we don't tell the unitiated about the sacrifice until they<br/>
have enter the 'family'.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
JUST KIDDING!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jenny,<br/>
Clearly, letterboxers are slightly twisted, creative folks.  (Yes, I<br/>
know that quote will circle around again, but if the cloven hoof<br/>
fits...)<br/>
<br/>
I myself am a "newbie" in that I have not been to a gathering.  That<br/>
said, I have had the distinct pleasure of letterboxing with some of the<br/>
most prolific of letterboxers: Princess Lea, Black Cavalier, and<br/>
Mimulus. Much of what I understand gatherings to be, I learned from my<br/>
conversations with these three really cool folks.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, my family was so impressed with letterboxing, that we are<br/>
planning a gathering!  So the first gathering I'll attend is the one<br/>
I'm organizing (No Foolin' Letterboxing Gathering, April 1st, Alum Rock<br/>
Park, San Jose, CA....shameless plug #57).  <br/>
<br/>
My understanding is that folks chat, share their logbooks, eat, find<br/>
some boxes nearby.  And there is usually an event stamp--something<br/>
created to commemorate the gathering.  The last event in the Bay Area<br/>
was the Bay Area Shoreline Shindig organized by EclipseTuliphead,<br/>
Princess Lea, with a stamp carved by artTrekker if I recall what Lea<br/>
told me. Anyway, I've seen the stamp-WOW!  There can be other event<br/>
stamps, called traveling event stamps.  These are letterboxes that only<br/>
show up at gatherings.  So, for the gathering in April, I pretty much<br/>
groveled to anyone who would listen and managed to land a half dozen or<br/>
so VERY COOL event stamps.  Some of these will be hidden near the<br/>
gathering, others will stay on a table in the gathering area (per the<br/>
owner's request).  Oh, and we had an offer for an orienteering lecture<br/>
from MelOutdoorEd (who, as the name implies, has a background in<br/>
outdoor education). How cool is that?  And just for good measure, we're<br/>
tossing in some door prizes of random kitch I purchased while<br/>
letterboxing (who doesn't need another cheese knife or a driftwood<br/>
troll?).<br/>
<br/>
Now, I'm sure the highly seasoned letterboxers (makes them sound like<br/>
steak tartar, doesn't it?) are going to correct my newbie errors. <br/>
GOOD!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to keep the message board a movin'.<br/>
<br/>
Usually my procrastination is a sure sign I am under deadline and in<br/>
the grips of writer's block.  Today would be no different.  WAH!  Back<br/>
to work for me.<br/>
<br/>
