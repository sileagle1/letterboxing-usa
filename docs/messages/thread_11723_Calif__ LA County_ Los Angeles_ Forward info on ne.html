  Subject: [LbNA] I seem to be having nothing but problems with the computer today!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Ok, millionth attempt:<br/>
<br/>
  We have hidden our first letterbox and were unable to<br/>
  post or join talklist at www.letterboxing.org<br/>
  We're really excited and want others to be able to<br/>
  find it A.S.A.P.!!! (Especially since there seem to<br/>
  bevery few in our area!)<br/>
  We'll tell you the clues here and please post them or<br/>
  forward them - or if worse comes to worse let us<br/>
  knowhow we can do it.<br/>
  Here are our first-ever clues:<br/>
<br/>
  "Two Cats and a Troll Griffith Park Letterbox"<br/>
  Los Angeles, California<br/>
  Griffith Park<br/>
  Difficulty: Easy<br/>
<br/>
  1.) Enter Griffith Park at the Western Entrance off<br/>
  Franklin (near corner where Western turns<br/>
  intoFranklin).<br/>
  2.) Go straight, past the Ferndell sign, on your left.<br/>
  Pass the narrow bridge to the stop sign. Just pastthat<br/>
  is a parking lot. Park.<br/>
  3.) Walk to the Southern corner of the parking lot and<br/>
  look directly through the split that the two huge tree<br/>
  trunks form (looks like a huge 'V').<br/>
  4.) Follow the path you see formed by a tiny rock<br/>
  walland fern covered fence.<br/>
  5.) Turn left and walk through the gate. Walk down<br/>
  steps to the bridge but turn right, do not<br/>
  crossbridge.<br/>
  6.) Continue following the path. Cross the tiny<br/>
  bridge. There is a little stream on your right.<br/>
  7.) Cross the second bridge and under two more (one<br/>
  wooden, one concrete). The stream is now on your left.<br/>
  8.) Cross another bridge. Admire the waterfall<br/>
  immediately to your right (manmade so not on all<br/>
  year). Look at the elephant ears.<br/>
  9.) The box is hidden across from the elephant<br/>
  earswhere a troll might live.<br/>
  10.) Climb down, turn 180 degrees, hug the rocks in<br/>
  front of you, the box is hidden by your left thigh,<br/>
  waist or chest depending on your height.<br/>
  Be discrete!! I recommend sitting at the bench a few<br/>
  more paces past the waterfall to stamp up.Happy<br/>
  Hunting!!<br/>
