ones ) and the stamp in the outer bag and the book in the inner bag. <br/>
Most of the rubbermade type boxes have held up well . The glad ware <br/>
experiment was a dismal failure I won't bother again. Did find 2 nice <br/>
snap lid plastic jars at a dollar sale , with very tight seal  wish <br/>
they had more. I will note after digging through a foot of snow at <br/>
Odiorne point ( N.H.)this winter we found a Drew box. It was frozen <br/>
to the ground under rock. We kicked that rock a hundred times to <br/>
loosen the icey grip. Then the box was frozen. It took some doing to <br/>
remove the lid, the base of the box was frozen in. On removing the <br/>
contents to stamp in we were very impressed the ink worked and so did <br/>
the Bic pen! Sounds like an old Timex commercial. But the rubbermade <br/>
box  and contents were fine if they can take that  they should last <br/>
well in other conditions. I'm off boxing soon. Hope everyone gets a <br/>
new count this week. Happy hunting!   Leader of the pack ( Ct.)<br/>
