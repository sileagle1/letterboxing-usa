There are lots of great boxes all around, but just one FYI for new RI 'boxers...<br/>
I work for the Audubon Society of Rhode Island and they don't allow letterboxing on their properties...bummer for us 'boxers, but I am obliged to let folks know that.<br/>
<br/>
Also, no boxes without permission in National Forests and Parks etc. State and local parks as well as local land trusts often have lots of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, check out www.letterboxing.org's listing of boxes as well as www.atlasquest.com for lots of box clues.<br/>
See you on the trails!<br/>
