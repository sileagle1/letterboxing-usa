The design of the stamp for this letterbox allows you to make imprints<br/>
of the leaves in different colors to reflect the season when you visit<br/>
the letterbox, so bring the appropriate colored inks. Since the<br/>
letterbox was placed in early fall, the logbook imprint depicts the<br/>
beginning of the "changing foliage".<br/>
<br/>
Begin your outing in McCormick's Creek State Park. Pay the nominal<br/>
entry fee and get a trail map. Go to the trailhead for Trail 2. The<br/>
sign on the right side of the road reads, "Trailside Shelter" and<br/>
"Begin Trail 2". Walk behind the CCC Recreation Hall and past the<br/>
Trailside Shelter #59 to the trailhead to begin your hike. At<br/>
different points on the trail, you'll pass Quarry Loop on your right,<br/>
large moss-covered boulders on your left, and you'll cross a small<br/>
wooden bridge. Eventually, you'll hike a steep ascent. Almost near the<br/>
top is a wooden bench on your left. Rest! From the bench take 20-25<br/>
steps continuing on the trail, then look to your right. You'll see a<br/>
very large tree in the shape of a Y. Behind this tree, at its base and<br/>
under rocks you'll find the Changing Foliage Letterbox. Have fun<br/>
playing the artist with different colored leaves!<br/>
