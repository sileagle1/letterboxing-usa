postings for the back surgery I had.  I was really sick thursday and <br/>
didn't think I was coming home on friday.  But, with prayers and <br/>
thoughts from everyone I was able to.  My wife Robin (Teach) has been <br/>
a great blessing, getting up with me all hours of the night to help <br/>
me out.  (She sat me down in front of the computer to answer the <br/>
emails and putting a posting online).  Thank you everyone again, and <br/>
we'll see you out on the trails in about 4 to 6 wks.  Dan (of Teach &amp; <br/>
Preach)<br/>
