<br/>
Another letterbox has been placed in Oregon.  This time in the coastal<br/>
hamlet of Lincoln City, Oregon at the Devil's Lake State Park Day Use area.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: There are two parts to Devil's Lake State Park and they are in<br/>
separate areas so please follow these directions carefully.  If you go to<br/>
the campground you'll be in a nice area, but you will not find the letterbox<br/>
(which is on another portion of the lake). There are lots of State Parks in<br/>
this area of the Oregon Coast so be aware of that and don't just follow any<br/>
old state park sign willy nilly if you're out to find this letterbox. We do<br/>
have excellent state parks here and they are worth going to for their own<br/>
merits, but at this time they don't all have letterboxes to hunt for.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  Go all the way into the town of Lincoln City on Hwy 101 from<br/>
either North or South.  Watch for the Lincoln City Factory Stores Mall on<br/>
the Eastside of the highway.  Go East on E. Devil's Lake Road, which is the<br/>
road that runs along the North Side of the Lincoln City Factory Stores.<br/>
Head down this road for about a mile, then turn left at the Oregon State<br/>
Park sign.   This is the Devil's Lake State Park Day Use area.  <br/>
<br/>
CLUES: Easy<br/>
<br/>
DIFFICULTY:  Distance is easy.  A small incline up a paved trail (not very<br/>
far) then a small decline down a dirt path (not very far).  Contact with<br/>
bushes, so you might want to dress for wet.<br/>
<br/>
DEVIL'S LAKE LETTERBOX<br/>
The parking area goes down toward two boat launches.  From the parking lot<br/>
close to the left hand-side boat dock there is an asphalt trail with a post.<br/>
Go up that trail beyond the picnic tables.  Continue on after the pavement<br/>
stops.  Go down the small hill and turn right at the next set of picnic<br/>
tables.  Go straight on the path through the big trees.  Continue on until<br/>
you can't go straight anymore.  There will be mossy snags right in front of<br/>
you.  Take a right and go 12 steps.  Turn and face right.  Now take 3 steps<br/>
up off the trail.  This mossy snaggy-looking tree surrounded by ferns has<br/>
the Devi's Lake Letterbox within its center.<br/>
