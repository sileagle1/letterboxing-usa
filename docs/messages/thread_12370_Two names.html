artist friend designed my stamp based on a bunch of adjectives he asked me <br/>
to provide about myself...there's more to it, but I'm a female <br/>
mountain-dwelling hiker who was born in November...<br/>
<br/>
When I tried to switch to the digest mode on this list, I couldn't make it <br/>
work, so I opened a new account under Volksboxer, which comes from my being <br/>
a volksmarcher as well as a letterboxer.<br/>
