<br/>
Location: Grants Pass, Josephine County, OR<br/>
Dropped: May 12, 2002, by J J M S &amp; A<br/>
Path: Can be muddy. Its a wetlands area.<br/>
<br/>
(Its a family event! Directions by Jeanne &amp; clues by Jade. If you find any <br/>
problems with this box or wish to share any successes, etc., please email <br/>
Annette at ARoseLb@aol.com.)<br/>
<br/>
CLUE: <br/>
This river front trail contains the first and currently only Pierce Riffle <br/>
Nature Trail Letterbox! To find it look between "J" and "K" for the two <br/>
"V"s in trees, dividing Long Slough and Bull Frog Pond! A bench is near the <br/>
spot!   (Be sure to look for Oregon ash, black-tailed deer, river otters, <br/>
pintails, <br/>
osprey, and many other varieties of wildlife!)<br/>
<br/>
TRAILHEAD:<br/>
The loop trail starts near the top of the boat ramp. Begin at post marked "B" <br/>
where the trail is briefly paved and then turns into a rocky footpath with <br/>
lovely views of the river and the sounds of wildlife.  (There is a map of the <br/>
trail near the trailhead in the park.  Watch out for Poison Oak.)<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS TO PIERCE RIFFLE NATURE PARK: <br/>
Off of I-5 (North or South), take Exit 55 into Grants Pass and immediately <br/>
turn left on Agness. The first cross street is Foothill Blvd. Mileage to the <br/>
park will start from this intersection so clear your speedometer. Take a left <br/>
on Foothill Blvd heading S.E. At 0.8 miles continue left on Foothill Blvd. <br/>
(DON'T go right to Tom Pearce Park). Foothill Blvd parallels the freeway. <br/>
Then at 2.1 miles go under an I-5 overpass. Turn right on Averill (2.8 miles) <br/>
and immediately over railroad tracks, then on to Pierce Riffle Park (3.6 <br/>
miles). Park near boat ramp. <br/>
