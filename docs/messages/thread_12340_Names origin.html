more than 20 years. My husband and letterboxing partner is 46r, <br/>
because he has climbed all the adirondack peaks over 4000 feet. He <br/>
has also climbed all the Northeast highest peaks. I have not climbed <br/>
the mountains with hims, only doing his last in the 46 peaks  for <br/>
the celebration! I am a slow hiker, but love the letterboxing.  My <br/>
husband always says I will do most any trail, with a guide book or a <br/>
letterbox. Painterly<br/>
