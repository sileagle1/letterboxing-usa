www.nvrpa.org/bullrunpark.html<br/>
<br/>
With an hour to wait before the start of a soccer game at Bull Run <br/>
Park, I introduced myself to the Bull Run-Occoquan Trail.  This 17.5 <br/>
mile trail, along the Occoquan Reservoir, rises over steep wooded <br/>
hillsides, winds through deep ravines and crosses many streams.  The <br/>
first two miles in was an easy walk, with many spots to stop and <br/>
enjoy the scenery and sounds of the lively streams and the creaking <br/>
trees!  A favorite book of my daughter Riana when she was little was <br/>
the Berenstain Bears Spooky Old Tree.  These woods are full <br/>
of "spooky old trees," one more interesting than the one before.  <br/>
Some are so tall and full of unusual growths, and unless my <br/>
imagination was playing tricks on me, do make spooky, creaking sounds.<br/>
<br/>
30 minutes in, with the same amount of time to hike back out in time <br/>
for the game, did not offer many possibilities to find a good spot <br/>
for the HikeinVA Leterbox.  The ground and trees, and stumps were <br/>
crawling with poison ivy.  Each spot which looked good was <br/>
inaccessible due to that nasty plant!  I was, however, determined to <br/>
leave the first of what I hoped to be many more along this lovely <br/>
trail.  It'll have to wait until the ivy's not so prolific.<br/>
<br/>
With a little caution, this box can be retrieved without fear of <br/>
breaking out in itchy bumps.<br/>
<br/>
I placed it on my way back out in a tree trunk which is split in the <br/>
front forming an upside-down "V".  Heading back to my starting point, <br/>
having walked over 6 wooden stepping boards set into the trail, I <br/>
spied a vine-less trunk on the left-hand side, not far off the <br/>
trail.  You'll find the HikeinVA Letterbox resting in the "V" split <br/>
trunk, kept in place by two heavy limbs.<br/>
<br/>
Including Bull Run Regional Park, there are four additional access <br/>
points along this 17.5 mile trail, which looks well worth additional <br/>
exploration.  If there are any Northern Virginia hikers/boxers out <br/>
there willing to spot cars with me to hike the trail, drop me a note <br/>
off list.<br/>
