Why not join the Great Lakes LB Group at<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/<br/>
<br/>
That is where all the IL letterboxers in your area are.  You can also<br/>
find information on the gathering in Urbana on the 21st!<br/>
<br/>
The best list of trail names can probably be found by looking at the<br/>
list of placers on LBNA.  Go to the LBNA site, click on Search for<br/>
Boxes, and look through the pull down menu for Pick a Placer.<br/>
