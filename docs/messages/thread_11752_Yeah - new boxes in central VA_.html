Ooh, is the clue up somewhere?<br/>
<br/>
I'm all wound up now and want to plant another one right away!  ;)  The <br/>
two other ones at Wintergreen are very nice, too -- very clear clues.  <br/>
Let me know if our clue isn't so clear; like I said, this is the first <br/>
one we've planted, so we're still learning how to write the things!<br/>
<br/>
While we were at Julia's Monkey Box, we ran into a family who have just <br/>
moved to the area (Waynesboro) and one of them works up at Wintergreen <br/>
in marketing.  We told them what we were doing (not giving away the box <br/>
or location, of course!) and showed them my log book and the box we <br/>
brought with us but hadn't hidden yet.  They were so intrigued, and <br/>
planned to go right home and look up the website right away.  More <br/>
people in the area is a good thing!<br/>
<br/>
yay!<br/>
