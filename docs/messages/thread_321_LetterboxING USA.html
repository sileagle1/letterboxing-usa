So, is this the final decision?  "Letterboxing USA"<br/>
I was bored, so I started fiddling with a logo design.<br/>
<br/>
I put the results of my doodling on the main L-USA page, with the maps.<br/>
There are actually two versions of the same logo shown.<br/>
At the top of the page is the larger embossed version.<br/>
At the bottom is the full color version.<br/>
After you've all told me that you hate both of them, I'll put it back the way<br/>
it was.<br/>

I likewise appreciate the effort you put into the drawing, Mitch, and <br/>
think that it is very elegant. But I share Susan's aversions to <br/>
extremely patriotic symbols, and think that her other comments as to <br/>
the map's being the primary focus of the page are also good.<br/>
<br/>
While we are talking about revising our home page and logo, I will <br/>
add that I liked your alternative map very much, Mitch - the one you <br/>
put up a number of months ago at Kid's Corner. You used to access it <br/>
by clicking Piglet, but it seems that link is gone. Anyway, as some <br/>
folks will remember, it was a larger map with lots of nice colors. I <br/>
am wondering if we could revisit that idea - just have one larger <br/>
map, that fills the screen and doesn't require arrowing around to see <br/>
different sections of the country. Perhaps the state contacts map <br/>
could be below it, instead of to the left. I don't know how wedded <br/>
you are, Dan, to the weather maps below the top two LUSA maps, <br/>
but they really don't seem to fit on the page, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as Susan says, this seems like a good time to discuss all <br/>
these possibilities for revision of the LetterboxING USA page. (I am <br/>
glad that this change in the title seems to be receiving favor.)<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	The logos Mitch has created are both eyecatching in their own way and<br/>
&gt; very nice.  Great that you would put the time in, Mitch, I know it took<br/>
&gt; a while.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I prefer the embossed version rather than the coloured one for several<br/>
&gt; reasons:<br/>
&gt; 	<br/>
&gt; 	I have a strong aversion to idealogical advertising of any 	Kind,<br/>
&gt; including nationalism (beyond using a symbol to identify).   This is why<br/>
&gt; I prefer the monochrome (or perhaps a shade difference?) symbol as<br/>
&gt; opposed to the ,IMHO, screamming eagle colors.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I like the embossed version because it identifies the group without<br/>
&gt; competing with the maps which should be the focal point of the page. <br/>
&gt; When you link to the website, you already know where you are going so<br/>
&gt; the emblem is an identifier that tells you when you've arrived at the<br/>
&gt; right place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	The embossed image is large (width) but not very dense (blackness) so<br/>
&gt; that the colored maps are clearly the focus of the page.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	<br/>
&gt; 	It is important that members comment on this logo stuff because we will<br/>
&gt; be living with it for a long time, hopefully.<br/>
