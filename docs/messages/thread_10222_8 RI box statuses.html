yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Small City, Central Falls, RI -- in place and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Afternoon on the Amazon, North Kingstown, RI -- in place and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Gift to Emily, North Kingstown, RI -- in place and intact.  The log <br/>
is full, however, and boxers are beginning to stamp on odd scraps of <br/>
paper.  We considered collecting the box, but since we don't know <br/>
Bob "The Wiz," we decided instead to add more blank pages.<br/>
<br/>
Trish's Twist Mystery -- in place and intact.  The stamp pad is very <br/>
wet, though.<br/>
<br/>
Palindromic Harmony Mystery -- in place and intact.  We were the <br/>
first to visit since it was placed almost a year ago.  We hope that <br/>
the placer will make him/herself known to us, as we were very <br/>
impressed with the cleverness of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Word to Your Mutha Limited Circulation -- in place and intact.  A <br/>
beautiful stamp and Rustypuff's 100th box.<br/>
<br/>
Crossways Crossed Paths II, East Greenwich, RI -- in place and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Crossways Crossed Paths I, East Greenwich, RI -- in place and <br/>
intact.  I reported this box missing back in March 2002 (I checked <br/>
twice, and it was not there!), and announced that I would not be <br/>
replacing it.  Then in November 2002 I changed my mind, recarved the <br/>
stamp, and hid a new box in a different spot.  Yesterday, after <br/>
Rustypuff stamped into the new box, I drove past the old hiding <br/>
place, just to point out where the original box "usta be."  Rustypuff <br/>
spotted something, and inexplicably, it turned out to be the original <br/>
box, right where it should be.  So she got to stamp into that one <br/>
too.  All I can think is that someone took the box, thought better of <br/>
it, and replaced it.  In any case, both boxes will remain in place, <br/>
and I will revise the clues on my website to include both locations.<br/>
<br/>
I should have the clues updated by tomorrow morning (1/14): <br/>

We're looking forward to seeing a great many of you at the January <br/>
18th gathering at Moose Hill!<br/>
