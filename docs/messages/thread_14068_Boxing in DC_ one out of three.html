anyway here are some updates:<br/>
<br/>
-We think the inventor is missing.  not sure.<br/>
<br/>
-the starting point for skull and bones is currently closed to the public.  the fence was passable but better judgement took over.<br/>
<br/>
-orion is a cool stamp that we almost missed.  the maps were gone, our tree identification skills are not great, and we almost missed it in the branches.  the note from the stamp thief is interesting.  has anyone considered that it might be a clue involving the old postage museum???<br/>

reported missing before and found in place.  The clues require very <br/>
careful reading.  Compass points are more complicated than one <br/>
thinks. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I have heard that Skull &amp; Bones is missing so the fence may not have <br/>
prevented you from getting to it.<br/>
<br/>
Orion stange note a clue for the Postal Museum?!?!  Wild.  I am <br/>
intrigued.  Consider that it is awfully neatly written to be the <br/>
street person it seems to be.  I am glad I took pics of it.  I'm <br/>
going to look.<br/>
