Sorry, team BeMa.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to say I too am planning on being there for the <br/>
gathering. I do not know what an event stamp is supposed to look <br/>
like, but I would love to have a go at carving one. I just carved my <br/>
first 2 stamps for placement. They are going in Hemlock Overlook <br/>
Regional Park soon. <br/>

&gt; Does anyone know if the Postal Museum removed the letterboxes it <br/>
hid <br/>
&gt; immediately after the event or if they are still in place?  I <br/>
looked at the <br/>
&gt; web site and didn't see any reference to it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We missed it last weekend and thought it might be a fun rainy day <br/>
activity.  <br/>
&gt; Thanks!  BeMa<br/>
