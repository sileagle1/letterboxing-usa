                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am relatively new to letterboxing.  P1 F15 X1.  I do however, feel <br/>
the need to speak to the present thread about parks.  Folks, this <br/>
is truly something we need to be concerned about.  I teach <br/>
tracking as a sideline and can tell you that I frequently see the <br/>
signs of past letterboxers.  The fact is that by letterboxing, we do <br/>
indeed affect the environment.  That being said, we do not affect <br/>
it much if we are careful about putting back the log we just <br/>
moved, replacing the leaves and stuff we just pulled up trying to <br/>
find the box etc.  I think the point is that perhaps we should be <br/>
fairly forceful about being respectful and leaving no trace when <br/>
introducing others to our pastime.  This is a wonderful hobby <br/>
and is unparalleled for getting kids out of doors.  Letterboxing <br/>
seem to be gaining in popularity.  As it grows, we all need to be <br/>
cognizant of the reputation we are creating.  <br/>
     One suggestion I have concerns clues for finding the box.  It is <br/>
fine if your clues are vague or even deliberately misleading.  You <br/>
can lead poor souls on a merry chase in getting to thier goal.  <br/>
But when it comes to actually locating the box we should <br/>
perhaps be VERY descriptive.  This may prevent folks from doing <br/>
too much rooting around trying to find the box in a large area that <br/>
seems to fit the description.  I would very much like to hear <br/>
others thoughts on this matter.  Please feel free to respond.  It <br/>
wont help any of us to get mad at the parks for removing boxes.  <br/>
They are doing what they think they need to in order to preserve <br/>
the park from people.  It is ironic that the parks are there for <br/>
people, but there it is.  People have a devastating effect on parks, <br/>
anyone who goes to parks realizes that this is true.  What makes <br/>
letterboxers different?  How can we raise ourselves above the <br/>
great unwashed to be welcomed by parks?<br/>

<br/>
ok :-) (and please don't flame me if you feel my thoughts are controversial,<br/>
flame the thoughts ... :-))<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a good idea.  I think it is in the faq somewhere.  Of<br/>
course, people have demonstrated their ignorance of etiquette and<br/>
conventions, so being a good idea doesn't have much meaning.  Of<br/>
course, it will come down to enforcement now.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I am not responsible for the actions of others in any way.<br/>
If someone brings in a backhoe to look for a box, that's their fault,<br/>
not mine.  By putting writing on my website that may or may not describe<br/>
the location of something interesting, I am not telling you how to get<br/>
there, whether to get there, or what to do on the way.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the onus is 100% on the searcher to do the right thing, so long<br/>
as the placer's actions on the way to the hiding place respects the <br/>
environment in the initial placement (and this may involve the placer<br/>
asking permission, or considering the social norms of the place).  <br/>
As for social trails or other damage, the searcher can remove the <br/>
box if they feel bothered by it and it is really there (which it may <br/>
not be), as can park people.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting thing to consider is this -- imagine letterboxing <br/>
without boxes.  If I remove all boxes (and I make no guarantees that<br/>
any boxes are there), yet leave the writing on my website, how does <br/>
that affect the calculus?  Well, my writing remains protected by the <br/>
first amendment, thus public park people can do nothing about it.  <br/>
But, they can still cite searchers who go off-trail to the putative <br/>
locations described in my writing.  Thus, again it seems clear that <br/>
the onus is 100% on the searchers to do the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
As a recent example, a hunt was described in eastern Iowa.  I've been<br/>
to that place myself; its called Effigy Mounds, IIRC.  IMO, that is<br/>
not an appropriate place to go off-trail, therefore I would not have<br/>
done so, despite the rumored presence of a box.  Again, the onus being<br/>
on the searcher.  I personally feel that complaining about the <br/>
placer's writing is meaningless.  You find yourself in a situation,<br/>
and you decide what the right thing to do is.  Perhaps the clue was<br/>
misread, or it was maliciously altered on the wire or on the website,<br/>
and they were writing about a different place altogether, or something<br/>
metaphorical.  (Just an example, I don't judge the actions of anyone<br/>
as I wasn't a witness.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It wont help any of us to get mad at the parks for removing boxes.<br/>
&gt; They are doing what they think they need to in order to preserve<br/>
&gt; the park from people.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with this.  One of two things will begin to happen.  People will<br/>
either work with the parks, as is done in every other off-trail sport<br/>
(with the possible exception of geocaching) that occurs in parks, or they<br/>
will place boxes anonymously, (as many people are doing already).<br/>
<br/>
Doing the latter will piss the parks off even more, and will give the<br/>
pastime an even worse reputation (but the non-anonymous people will pay<br/>
the price ... therefore _they_ will have incentive to remove boxes placed<br/>
anonymously).  The right answer, it seems, is some organization, <br/>
some PR, etc; but that has never materialized in the past when this <br/>
thread came up, and I don't expect it to now.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How can we raise ourselves above the great unwashed to be welcomed <br/>
&gt; by parks?<br/>
<br/>
We can't.  There is a great unwashed in every population I've ever seen.<br/>
That is why geocaching got a bad name first, because they had more people,<br/>
thus more great unwashed.  Now that we have more people, we are getting<br/>
a great unwashed also.  I have, for example, seen what the great unwashed<br/>
idiots have done at a location no where near one of my boxes.  If their<br/>
car leaks oil in the parking lot while they are searching, am I <br/>
responsible for that :-)<br/>
<br/>
We have to make our activity look more wholesome and less destructive, <br/>
than say, drilling for oil in ANWR or logging in national forests.  <br/>
Remember, its perception, not reality.  It will need an organization,<br/>
but I'm not to optimistic about the emergence of one ...<br/>
<br/>

Hi there,
<br/>I am brand new to letterboxing.....but have been a stamper, a naturalist
and a park ranger for many years...hence my enthusiasm for this "new to
me" past time.  Randy used the example of a recent posting of a new
letterbox at Effigy Mounds in NE Iowa.  That was my posting...my first
letterbox that I've hidden and I can assure you that it is in an appropiate
place.  If you have hiked up to the Marching Bears, Randy, you will
know that once you reach them, there is no trail...it is a large clearing
on the ridge top and one is free to walk among the mounds (but not on them).  
The letter box is hidden 13 steps from one of the bear mounds and on the
edge of the woods....I guess when I put it in the clues, I made it sound
like it is "off trail", but when one is there in person, and as you are
reading the clues, you will know that it is in an appropriate place. 
I should know, after all, since I am a park ranger there! I guess each
letterbox is a unique situation and hopefully everyone will make the right
decisions as they pursue this hobby.
