lunch and reviving drinks at The Wharf Tavern, we headed out to try <br/>
the Purgatory Point boxes.  We found the spot at Purgatory Chasm, but <br/>
alas the box seems to be missing.  Does anyone know the status of <br/>
this box?  Then it got too dark for trying <br/>
the box at Sachuest.  We almost did the Norman Bird Sanctuary ones <br/>
instead!<br/>

Although replaced after vandalism back in June 2000, that box was <br/>
again reported vandalized in August 2000 -- see message #3559.<br/>
