I have never seen a stamp like it. This stamp is on hand- carved on <br/>
both sides, and both are the same image (an acorn), just carved out a <br/>
little differently. On one side is the background; the other side is <br/>
the detail. I carved this stamp because I was running out of erasers <br/>
to carve onto, and wanted to do both stamps. This probably took me <br/>
about an hour total; you just have to be sure that you use the same <br/>
stencil for drawing out the picture, or you will have an uneven stamp.<br/>

This made me laugh, because it was so true today.  I found a flooded lb that had a red ink pad in it.  You wouldn't believe how much red ink was on my pants after I got back!  It looked like I'd killed something in the woods!  Also, last night I was carving a stamp and got a load of green ink on my hands. <br/>
