the list since my last message, I decided to send one more reminder about<br/>
the Southern Ohio gathering that welcomes all boxers - beginners to<br/>
experienced- from any part of the world. It will be an all day event on<br/>
Sunday June 15th on the South West side of Cincinnati in Miami Whitewater<br/>
Forest. Exchanges and lunch before noon, then 'boxin' all afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
*** As an extra temptation, I will let you know that we will have some very<br/>
special out of town guests and you'll be proud to have a remembrance of<br/>
their visit in your log book :-) No more hints than that.<br/>
<br/>
If you will be coming, or think that you might come, please LET ME KNOW<br/>
RIGHT AWAY! I have made an email list of all the people that responded and I<br/>
will communicate directly with them, so that the list isn't clogged with all<br/>
the details/questions.<br/>
<br/>
Send your RSVP to: DogScouts @ hotmail . com or in case the link works in<br/>
the email: DogScouts@hotmail.com<br/>
