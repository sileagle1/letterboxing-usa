letterboxes today. Glad I did as my Norwottuck Rail Trail box in <br/>
Amherst, MA was a lump of ice. Put in a new pad and microwaved the <br/>
old one to dry it out. Worked well. Still able to see most of the <br/>
stamps and names. My Chicopee State Park box in MA is still a virgin, <br/>
however and awaits it's first visitor. The park is open til 4pm and <br/>
if you enjoy military planes, I had 4 fly overhead while I was there. <br/>
Westover Air Force base is next door and boy are those planes loud!<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
