                    <div class="plaintext-content">This beautiful fall day had me out to do "care and feeding" of my <br/>
letterboxes.  One thing is for sure, letterboxing is a dynamic <br/>
sport.  The boxes are in the same place, but their surroundings <br/>
surely can change!  I will be posted updated clues for the following:<br/>
<br/>
Tangled Woods - for those of you who left notes asking about "where's <br/>
the drink of the orient?", the tea company up the street relocated!<br/>
<br/>
Hunters Falls - the "tribe" has apparently accepted this letterbox, <br/>
since I found it sitting on *top* of its hiding place, in plain view, <br/>
but the contents were undisturbed.<br/>
<br/>
Marathon - The Park Service has made this one an easier find with new <br/>
trail markers.<br/>
<br/>
Peace on Earth - Now who would have thought the town would have moved <br/>
an entire *street*?!<br/>
<br/>
Angel's Lookout is still the same.<br/>
<br/>
Now for a question:<br/>
<br/>
Waldenrun had planted a letterbox called "Piece of Cake".  The link <br/>
to the clues no longer works.  I have tried to contact Waldenrun both <br/>
here and in the geocaching community, but I have never received a <br/>
reply.  I am fortunate enough to have a hard copy of the original <br/>
clues, and I will be happy to post these clues so that others may <br/>
seek this letterbox.  I would also be anxious to hear from anyone who <br/>
has actually found this letterbox.  Today was my 10th attempt, and I <br/>
just plain give up.  If anyone has actually found this box (Pete and <br/>
Wanda: in the Marathon log book, you indicated that you were going to <br/>
hit that box after Marathon), PLEASE contact me offline at <br/>
WarriorInGilead@yahoo.com.  I have several questions.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience.<br/>
