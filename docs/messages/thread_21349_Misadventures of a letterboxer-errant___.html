So this home schooling mother of two is striving with a self-imposed <br/>
goal of trying to improve her knowledge of the classics.  She's <br/>
currently 18 chapters into the 1,000 page novel "Don Quixote". <br/>
Hmmm???  Tackling the episodic adventure of the ultimate knight <br/>
errant.  How does this pertain to letterboxing? Well, quite fitting, <br/>
if you ask me.  Today is just one more example of how our attempt to <br/>
seek out adventures in all things letterboxing bears more <br/>
resemblance to Don Quixote's quest to right the wrongs (although he <br/>
wrongs more rights than rights he the wrongs) and ensure justice <br/>
prevails throughout his self-induced chivalric 'world' than it <br/>
appears anything like a quick, effortless letterboxing trek.  So, <br/>
the tome of the misadventures of this letterboxer-errant now <br/>
proceeds...<br/>
<br/>
This being a day that not presents itself all that often anymore--a <br/>
day wholly devoted to exploring for letterboxes; we set our sights <br/>
upon a handful of Seattle area treasures.  We quickly, nimbly locate <br/>
and quench our hunger for Zen fruit.  All is right with the world; <br/>
balanced, centered.  Then, we set our sights upon the fun game of <br/>
Duck, Duck, Goose.  Well, God has bestowed upon us an incredible <br/>
knack for turning a 2.5 mile hike into some 5, 6 perhaps even more <br/>
miles.  Great for my exercise regime--not so inspirational for the <br/>
kids, who both attained the ages of 6 and 3 during their most recent <br/>
birth anniversaries. How, you may wonder?  Well, it all transpired <br/>
like this:  <br/>
<br/>
We set out for Duck #1.  No luck--so we walk ALL the way around a <br/>
phantom of a lake.  Still no luck; the box eludes us.  Then, <br/>
somewhere along this 'interlude' of a hike, we realise we have lost <br/>
the clue sheets--never to be seen or heard from again.  When we <br/>
realize the clue sheet has vanished, we backtrack our steps hoping <br/>
to find it.  No luck--gone as sure as the phantom himself.  No <br/>
problem, I think to myself--I have my laptop on hand, as a <br/>
letterboxer-errant is ever prepared for such circumstances; this <br/>
beacon of technological wonder should contain the clues to all <br/>
our 'unfound' boxes in this glorious state.  Well, we venture off to <br/>
a nearby playground--the kids quite pleased with the opportunity to <br/>
roam the big toys for however much time they please (i.e. whatever <br/>
time it takes me to load up the computer, fail in finding <br/>
the 'saved' clues for this particular series and quickly realize the <br/>
screen isn't 'bright' enough to use without a power source more <br/>
substantial than the internal battery--so any attempt at trying to <br/>
find a 'wireless' internet connection fails, as well).  Ever the <br/>
letterbox-errant, I think to myself:  "No problem, I looked at the <br/>
clues a couple of times before we set out upon our quest--and <br/>
internalized them with that photographic memory I wished I'd <br/>
had." ;) Anyways, at this point we have nothing more to lose (beyond <br/>
our pride) except a great day for a hike along a gorgeous trail; <br/>
boxes or no boxes, we'll welcome whatever fate for us bears in <br/>
store.  So, we decide we'll continue on with our trek, clueless now, <br/>
mind you.  We trudge away and eventually find Duck #2 (remember this <br/>
is Duck, Duck, Goose--a game sure to be played in a certain sequence <br/>
otherwise it just doesn't fare as the rules suggest it should) armed <br/>
with a single noun from the clues posted ever-vigilantly in my non-<br/>
existant memory.  We continue on and eventually find Goose; again <br/>
armed with nothing but a single noun from the clue.  Now, having <br/>
realized our earlier 2-mile long mistake we backtrack to Duck #1 and <br/>
find it--as Don Quixote would say, non problemo!  So, what should <br/>
have been a game of Duck, Duck, Goose turned into a game of No Duck, <br/>
Duck, Goose, then Duck.  Well, even worse, what should have been <br/>
about an hour long trek turned into 3 hours; AND the handful of <br/>
other regional letterboxes in our long-awaited queue quickly fades <br/>
to none.<br/>
<br/>
So, you think the story ends here, eh?  No, my dear friends.  We <br/>
decide to venture home--sated with the few great impressions of <br/>
letterboxes we did manage to find on this letterboxer-errant laden <br/>
trek.  Along the way we decide to follow up on a 'hunch' for another <br/>
mystery box in the state.  Unfortunately, this particular box is <br/>
absolutely clueless!  Completely, utterly, dreadfully clueless.  <br/>
Anyway, this hunch has been grumbling away in me for quite some time <br/>
now, perhaps a year and a half or so???--just never got an <br/>
opportunity to test the theory.  So, as a consolation we set out to <br/>
test a whim of a theory--if we fail, we'll at least have another <br/>
neat walk about the region--hoping to perhaps see some migrating <br/>
birds along the way.  So, we arrive at the 'hunch' of a location and <br/>
trudge along our trek.  Armed with no clues, a weak hunch and an <br/>
uncanny ability to think like a letterbox planter we start testing <br/>
our theory.  Lo &amp; behold imagine the surprise, amazement, tears of <br/>
joy and whoop-whoop-hollerin' of high fives that occur when we <br/>
actually find the box--on our second probe during the first 'test' <br/>
of our theory!!!!  So, we truly found "clueless!" cluelessly!!!  We <br/>
found Duck, Duck, Goose "semi-cluelessly".  What's even more bizarre <br/>
is about 2 years ago we found the Hidden Palms Letterbox in Oregon <br/>
with no clues.  The folks who planted it had even lost the clues <br/>
they drafted before they were able to post them so even THEY were <br/>
totally, utterly clueless, too.  That--for a while had been the <br/>
ultimate clueless box out there in our letterboxing-errant <br/>
autobiography.  Now, we have a few more clueless episodes to add to <br/>
our letterboxer-errant lifetime achievement award!!!  And still to <br/>
this day we continue along our 'letterboxing-errant' life cluelessly-<br/>
-enjoying the sights, sounds and adventures we seek out among the <br/>
trails along the way.<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to chapter XIX...<br/>

postscript.  would anybody care to join us as we venture out in <br/>
quest of Mt Si, Poo Poo Pt and Mt Pilchuk???  ;)  We may never find <br/>
those letterboxes but we can at least guarantee you an interesting <br/>
day and a GREAT workout--letterboxer-errant style!!!<br/>

super-postscript.  "for they deserve, by privilege and right, <br/>
whatever hospitality they receive, in repayment for the intolerable <br/>
hardships they undergo in Seeking Adventures by night and day, in <br/>
winter and summer, on foot and horse, in thirst and hunger, in heat <br/>
and cold, subject to all the inclemencies of the skies and all the <br/>
discomforts of the earth."  excerpt from the XVII. chapter of Miguel <br/>
de Crevantes Saavedra's The Adventures of Don Quixote, translated by <br/>
