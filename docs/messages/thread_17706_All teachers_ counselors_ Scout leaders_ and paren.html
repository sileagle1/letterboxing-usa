It is just my opinion but I am reluctant to introduce letterboxing to <br/>
large groups whether they are interested or not.  I fear that in a <br/>
large group, like a class, a few people will be interested, many <br/>
people will not have a long term interest, and a few people are <br/>
potential vandals.  I believe our hobby of leaving valuable stuff out <br/>
in the open survives on being quiet and discrete.  <br/>
<br/>
Attracting those who are interested and avoiding attracting the <br/>
attention of others seems like a good thing to me.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was a Scoutmaster and I used letterboxing as a tool to teach different subjects, compass, forestry, map reading etc. Before I go on also let me say I am a backpacker and hate large groups in the woods. They are destructive. I totally agree about not introducing letterboxing to large groups. So how do I use letterboxing. Simple I planted my own letterboxes and when I was done I had the scouts remove them, to use again another day and another place. During my presentation before the hunt I briefly mentioned that there is a real letterboxing world out there. Anyone interested would ask me about it later. Every few did. Mostly the parents of the scouts that were there. <br/>
