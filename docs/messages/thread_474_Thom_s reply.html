&gt;  I believe it is in the best interest<br/>
&gt;  of the group to continue to link to Randy and Mitch's clues...<br/>
&gt;  Unless I read some damn compelling argument in favor of another, I<br/>
&gt;  support Randy's option #1.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  If this list is a true democracy, then let's put it to the test...<br/>
<br/>
Thom, there's no reason to be so short.  The site IS handled<br/>
democratically<br/>
for all the ways that it can be handled that way.  This applies to all<br/>
the changes made to date, the Kids corner, the logo, the colors, the <br/>
different clues formats, etc. and all of this I know how to do through<br/>
input from the group and still be able to do it economically.  But I<br/>
don't think you or most members of the group are aware of the limits<br/>
both of me and what can be done technically speaking.  If you thought<br/>
they were bored and bothered by just the synopsis of the issue, wait<br/>
until<br/>
they get the details of it!  I don't think we want to go there on the<br/>
main<br/>
list.  We<br/>
would not have gone there at all if Graham would have monitored all<br/>
the posts, one of which suggested we not do that and I agreed and no one<br/>
opposed it.  In fact, it was Randy and I who wanted to do this not on<br/>
the main list.  But Graham came in without knowledge and though his<br/>
words<br/>
were nice they were also woefully ignorant of what is going on (no<br/>
insult<br/>
to Graham personally.  Ignorant Graham is not.  He's actually very<br/>
knowledgeable, but not about this thread.)  So Graham made a mistake<br/>
and I hold nothing <br/>
against him for it.  BTW, Mitch's<br/>
clues are on this site currently as we speak and as long as he does <br/>
not pull them they will remain there.  Randy can put his there also<br/>
with no trouble whatever.  But unless he or you or somebody else is<br/>
willing to take on the technical difficulties that will be encountered<br/>
when I make the changes that I will have to make in order to streamline<br/>
the system (again, this is technical stuff, yuk!  but its something I<br/>
need to do in order to keep my sanity and have enough time to take a<br/>
shower before I go to bed)...  but unless someone wants to take that<br/>
on (they can do it by group input or however they want) they should not<br/>
be arbitrating this.  I respectfully ask that anyone who wants to <br/>
discuss the details of it talk to me off list or on the<br/>
technical list and I will be more than happy to share the details of the<br/>
problem.  But be willing to spend some time thinking about it if you're<br/>
going to do that.  Its complicated.  And please have some technical<br/>
knowledge also.  I think those with technical knowledge are currently<br/>
on that list, but if others of you are out there who want to be part<br/>
of this thread you're welcome to join the technical list.  Just go to<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/mail.htm and look on the right side of the<br/>
page<br/>
for "Technical Folks"<br/>
<br/>
The simplest thing to do is for <br/>
Randy to just copy his stuff from his server to the one being used<br/>
by the rest of the group.  If that was done we could skip the whole<br/>
technical issue because i would then not be encountering any of the<br/>
problems that I am (and will be) encountering if he insists on me <br/>
maintaining hard links to his server.<br/>
<br/>
A while back I offered that it would be good to just consider it<br/>
a shared work, house all the clues together and go from there.  I <br/>
did this because (though I knew there were technical problems with<br/>
doing it the other way) I was hoping that people would just buy in<br/>
on those terms alone and thus save me (and the talk list) a huge<br/>
hassle later on.  It didn't work, so here we are.  C'est Le Vie!<br/>
<br/>
One more thing should be said here:<br/>
I'm not forcing anyone to put their<br/>
clues here.  Nor am I holding anyone hostage.  I don't feel its right<br/>
for people to be accusing me of things I am not doing and I would<br/>
appreciate it if that would stop.  I don't think I am asking too<br/>
much.  I'm not harboring ill feelings or resentments toward Randy<br/>
or anyone else so those of you who keep saying that stop it.<br/>
I'm tired of having to repeat over and over I have no ill feelings.<br/>
Its not fair to keep doing that to me when I keep<br/>
telling you that's not how I feel.  A little trust in what I say<br/>
(what I keep saying over an over) is in order here.  Unless you<br/>
know something to the contrary and have direct knowledge of it<br/>
you should not be making these accusations.  It just raises<br/>
unnecessary suspicions among those who come in late to the<br/>
conversation (exactly what happened with Graham).  So please stop<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in favor of the thread ending on the main list and that<br/>
anyone with technical skills who truly wants to become involved<br/>
in that end of it can help me come up with workable solutions off<br/>
of this list.  I think John and a few others may have ideas, but<br/>
its going to bore everyone here, so let's take it to the appropriate<br/>
list.  If something can be worked out it will.  Perhaps there<br/>
are other solutions.  I don't<br/>
know.  I do know this is mostly technical at this point.  I'm also<br/>
tired of being accused of things I am not doing and perhaps if<br/>
we relegate the discussion to purely technical things it will get<br/>
the focus off of who may be trying to do something underhanded.  I<br/>
don't feel that's happening at all.  I know with certainty it is<br/>
not what I'm doing and I'm fairly certain no one else is doing it.<br/>
So please let's not take this any lower than it has already gone in<br/>
terms of insults, innuendo, suspicions, negative implications, etc.<br/>
That's the stuff that IS bothersome.  Merely discussing things<br/>
and doing it respectfully is not a problem. I think<br/>
the emotional statements people are making will subside if we <br/>
take this to a technical forum.  So please let's do that.  Anyone<br/>
can join and then they will not have an excuse to complain because<br/>
they will know in advance they are in for something complicated<br/>
and yes, BORING.  So, if you join, be prepared and do not whine<br/>
about boredom or complexities.<br/>
If you want to join that list go to http://www.pclink.com/elf/mail.htm<br/>
and look for "Technical Folks".  Whatever happens there can be summed up<br/>
for everyone else on the main list (if they even care to know).<br/>

<br/>
ps. What prompted me to write this is the many statements that people<br/>
have made that they don't want to go here.  At the same time it<br/>
should be resolved and perhaps it can be resolved with a technical<br/>
solution. Please do not accuse me yet again of not considering<br/>
other's views.  Enough of you have said, "Let's not do this."<br/>
I'm listening.  But obviously something needs to be done.  The<br/>
problem's not going away on its own.  So the next best solution<br/>
is to relegate it to Technical talk.  If anyone thinks this is<br/>
not the best thing to do at this point please speak up.  Otherwise<br/>
let it die on the main list as it seems to be what everyone<br/>
wants, and I, for one, did not want it to go there in the first<br/>
place.<br/>

It seems to me you must enjoy stirring up controversy and keeping it alive.<br/>
<br/>
The details, endless discussion and insults (Graham, ignorant???If that<br/>
ain't the pot callin' the kettle black--I know, I know, you said he isn't,<br/>
generally ignorant, but geez, I don't think you need to make that judgement<br/>
here of any of us ever...)-- all this knit-picky stuff is sucking the life<br/>
and joy out of this delightful hobby for me.<br/>
<br/>
You said:<br/>
&gt;So please let's not take this any lower than it has already gone in<br/>
&gt;terms of insults, innuendo, suspicions, negative implications, etc.<br/>
&gt;That's the stuff that IS bothersome.<br/>
<br/>
No kidding!  But you've sent a long, condescending message complete with<br/>
all the above listed bad things and you don't think people will want to<br/>
respond to that?  Hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
I'm outta here.  I'll put my clues up on my pages (Atmospheric Cookie) or<br/>
have them available by e-mail.  Anybody anywhere can link or copy anything.<br/>
I just don't care any more.  It will take a few days for me to do this, but<br/>
I'm doin' it!<br/>

<br/>
Julie, this is a terrible insult which should not have been said.<br/>
Its the connotation of the word ignorant that you inferred from<br/>
my statement.  There was no ill intent.  Again, this was the result<br/>
of rumors.  Somebody contacted Graham off-list and put a bug in his<br/>
ear.  He had a very small part of the story.  You probably do too.<br/>
<br/>
A while back people told me I was ignorant of copyright law.  I admit<br/>
that.  I do not take it as an insult.  When you say somebody is<br/>
ignorant of something it simply means they don't know about it.  Its<br/>
not an insult.<br/>
<br/>
All of you can contact me off-list at mailto:elf@pclink.com<br/>
and I will tell you what is going on with the links issue if that is<br/>
what's bothering you.  This is not the appropriate place to do it.<br/>
You can check out what I say to see if it gels with what other people<br/>
who understand technical things will tell you.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to join the Technical group.  You can do that by<br/>
going to http://www.pclink.com/elf/mail.htm<br/>
<br/>
I will happily support those of you who want to use this service.<br/>
But I think we should enforce the rule of no insults on the list.<br/>
At least if you do it you should aplogize to the person whom you <br/>
insulted.  And if you see it happen to somebody else you should<br/>
stick up for them.  What's going to happen down the road (and any<br/>
one of you may be next) if we allow this?  We all need protection<br/>
from the rumor-mongers.  Please squelch rumors instead of passing<br/>
them on.  Please ask questions and become informed before speaking.<br/>
If we do not all make a concerted effort to do this everything we<br/>
have strived for will eventually go down the tube.  Loose lips<br/>
sink ships.  Well, they destroy letterboxing too.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you have to pull down your stuff like the others, Julie.  It<br/>
really is not necessary.  You're welcome to leave it up there or<br/>
put it back later if you decide you need the service.  BTW, if you<br/>
need help pulling it let me know.  I may have changed the password<br/>
yet again.  All the gossip and accusations is unnerving.<br/>
