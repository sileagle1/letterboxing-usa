know the eastern part of the Air Line trail, It is rough and not <br/>
developed as the Western sections are. This is a very hard trip and <br/>
quite an adventure. The stamp they are carring is only going to be <br/>
used for 5 days. The time of the trip. it is a great stamp for a once <br/>
in a lifetime trip. Don't miss out on getting a copy of this stamp. <br/>

catch them tomorrow.  I have an empy car and will be leaving from <br/>
Niantic if anyone wishes to travel with me, or meet somewhere along the <br/>
way to car pool.  Carol will be telling us where she will be tomorrow <br/>
 so watch for her check in either tonight or early in the morning.  I <br/>
will be leaving later in the morning as family is coming for father's <br/>
day breadfast.<br/>
