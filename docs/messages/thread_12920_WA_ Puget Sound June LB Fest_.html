<br/>
We're trying to coordinate a sort of 'low-key' Puget Sound <br/>
letterboxing fest sometime during June for any letterboxers who are <br/>
interested in meeting other letterboxers from around the region.  <br/>
Tumwater Historical Park (just at I-5 &amp; Hwy 101 interchange in the <br/>
Olympia area) offers a nice facility with picnic tables, playgrounds, <br/>
running water/toilets and is centrally located to numerous 'quicky' <br/>
letterboxes in the region.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the dates/times we can be available for planning such an <br/>
event:<br/>
<br/>
14 June (Sat)--afternoon, anytime after 3:30pm<br/>
15 June (Sun)--afternoon, anytime after 1:00pm<br/>
<br/>
22 June (Sun)--afternoon, anytime after 1:00pm<br/>
<br/>
28 June (Sat)--all day<br/>
29 June (Sun)--afternoon, anytime after 1:00pm<br/>
<br/>
If there is any interest out there, please drop us an email, post <br/>
your comments to the board, or check out the Yahoo Groups LbPNW group <br/>
and post your comments there.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you soon,<br/>
<br/>
