possibly disturbed RARE environments or rare species, plus the possibility<br/>
of even more trash from the boxers who not only aren't going to take out<br/>
other folks' trash but might leave their own including abandoned boxes and<br/>
vandalised boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Something tells me park rangers are too smart to believe that "EVERY time" a<br/>
letterboxer goes into a park, they're going to also be hauling out trash.  I<br/>
know it's a nice warm-fuzzy-feeling kind of thought, but I think they're too<br/>
smart to think that's ever gonna start happening on anything other than a<br/>
one in a thousand basis......if even that.  Like most of us, rangers may<br/>
have been born in the dark but it wasn't yesterday.  If I was a ranger, I'd<br/>
be sayin' "Yeah, right......suuuure y'all are pickin' up garbage."   I have<br/>
a hunch they're not going to feel there's any sort of REALISTIC cost/benefit<br/>
ratio there that would be in favor of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I'm definitely not saying it's not worth a shot.  I'm just saying folks<br/>
shouldn't go gettin' their hopes up that it's going to change any sort of<br/>
negative preserve policies.  :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Perhaps I should have stated myself differently so as not to create the<br/>
possibility of getting caught up in verbiage - by saying "every" time, I<br/>
only meant that we do something as a matter of course vs. at a one time<br/>
event.  My apologies on the wording...<br/>
<br/>
And you're right the park ranger may not believe we always, every time pick<br/>
up trash and frankly, neither do I.  I know I don't.  Most of the time, I'm<br/>
pretty good about it, but sometimes I get so wrapped up talking to the folks<br/>
I'm with that I forget to watch out for trash, or I am so intent on the<br/>
clues that I forget about trash until after I've found the box.  I confess<br/>
that I usually find more trash on my way out than I did on my way in, and<br/>
that lies in the fact that I have less to draw away my attention on my way<br/>
out.  It would be silly to believe that every person does it exactly right<br/>
every time - by virtue of human nature, that's a failed effort before it<br/>
ever begins - but if we highlight the idea of trash pickup, it puts it<br/>
higher in the mind's eye than if we don't and it makes us all more likely to<br/>
do better.<br/>
<br/>
Rangers do recognize effort when they see it though.  If they approve a<br/>
given box and the placer points out that they are requiring trash pickup as<br/>
a condition of access to the clues, and then the placer contacts the park<br/>
about how much trash has been picked up by people visiting that box (or<br/>
heck, the boxer shows them their collection efforts as they leave the park),<br/>
and then the rangers go out into their own park and over time notice that it<br/>
does seem to be staying a little better, instead of attributing it to the<br/>
general public being cleaner, they might actually recognize that<br/>

called "Texas Trash".  You'll have to contact me for the clues.  <br/>
Perhaps I should have picked a "trashier" park.  I took a trash bag <br/>
with me and walked probably 3 miles on the trails and found NO TRASH! <br/>
There was even a small picnic area near the trailhead and it was <br/>
perfectly clean.  How can I pick up trash if there's no trash, and I <br/>
was looking for it to prove my point.  I took the opportunity to <br/>
replace Lone Star Quilter's box The Bird in Black while I was there.  <br/>
The image is the same and it is very close to the original location, <br/>
so isn't to be considered a new box.  This is really a nice park and <br/>
would make a great place for an event if it didn't have the <br/>
reputation of being "anti-letterboxing".<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think a Trash Out event is an awesome idea to make a big <br/>
&gt; splash. It<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; demonstrates to park rangers that letterboxers are willing to <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; together<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in their parks for the purpose of pitching in and toting out.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; However, the thing I like about BootsTex' idea is that it <br/>
&gt; demonstrates to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rangers that by having one box on their grounds, they <br/>
reap "xxx" <br/>
&gt; amount of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; benefit. It gives them a quantitative way to measure the cost <br/>
vs. <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; benefit of a single box. It also shows that while they may not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; see individual letterboxers come and go (and hopefully they <br/>
DON'T <br/>
&gt; see us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; come and go), we are doing something positive EVERY time we go <br/>
&gt; into a park.<br/>
