Yes, and I know the backstory: I planted a "mini-mystery" box in a SLPL library which was subsequently found by accident by a librarian.  We corresponded a bit, but she didn't actually sound terribly interested - next thing you know, she emails to tell me they are planting in all the libraries!  The SLPL account/planter name was created specifically for these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
These are limited-time-only, for the month of April.  I was thinking of emailing her to ask if perhaps these boxes could return in July for LB Con...any thoughts on that?<br/>

Obviously, not everyone who participated had the best boxing technique (and as far as I know, none of the noxers took up letterboxing as a result), but a lot of families got outside and used the parks. I think I prefer St. Louis' approach. This won't create social trails and inexperienced kids won't get poison ivy in the face.<br/>

Yes, and I know the backstory: I planted a "mini-mystery" box in a SLPL library which was subsequently found by accident by a librarian. We corresponded a bit, but she didn't actually sound terribly interested - next thing you know, she emails to tell me they are planting in all the libraries! The SLPL account/planter name was created specifically for these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
These are limited-time-only, for the month of April. I was thinking of emailing her to ask if perhaps these boxes could return in July for LB Con....any thoughts on that?<br/>

Also how some of the very first letterboxes in the US were planted in libraries. <br/>
Here's a link to Tom Cooch's original library box that is still there, I believe: <br/>

Kudos to SLPL - the placer of the numerous new letterboxes in the St. Louis Public Libraries. If appears the library district has a letterboxing angel. Well done.<br/>

Maybe we could think about a mini-meet a couple weeks before LB Con... have a stitch 'n' b**ch, but with carving and logbook making and whatnot.  :-)  Nothing big, just meet up in a coffee shop or something.<br/>
