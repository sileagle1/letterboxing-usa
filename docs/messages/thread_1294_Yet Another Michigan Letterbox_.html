<br/>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/>
<br/>
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br/>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br/>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br/>
The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br/>
<br/>
He took his vorpal compass in hand:<br/>
Long time the manxome box he sought<br/>
So rested he by the Tulip Tree,<br/>
At the end of the second parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br/>
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br/>
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br/>
And burbled as it came!<br/>
<br/>
Two-fifty-five degrees* to the edge of the wood,<br/>
To a trailhead nearly hid nearby;<br/>
Two-forty degrees and seventeen paces**<br/>
At the root of the problem, he had to try.<br/>
<br/>
One, two! One, two! And through and through<br/>
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br/>
He left it dead, and with its head<br/>
He went galumphing back.<br/>
<br/>
"And, hast thou found the Letterbox?<br/>
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br/>
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!"<br/>
He chortled in his joy.<br/>
<br/>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br/>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves,<br/>
And the mome raths outgrabe.<br/>
