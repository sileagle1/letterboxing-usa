Well we finally got to search for Letterboxes! We just spent 3 days camping<br/>
in Voluntown, CT and found 6 boxes. There was only one box that we couldn't<br/>
find, the Narragansett Whiterock.<br/>
 It was very exciting to search &amp; find these boxes! Only my daughter got<br/>
tired espec ially the "Misery Loves Company" box. What a climb! The last few<br/>
boxes only my son &amp; I searched, it really gave us some quality time together<br/>
and work out clues and hiking through the woods, the main reason I was<br/>
interested in Letterboxing.<br/>
 I have to say that Connecticut has a lot of beautiful State parks &amp; trails<br/>
in this area. You could hide dozens of boxes in this south eastern New<br/>
England area.<br/>
 Searching for these boxes really taught me a lot about Letterboxing and<br/>
what I should do with mine. For starters my boxes are too easy, form now on<br/>
I will make them more challenging. It also gave me ideas on how to hide<br/>
them. Connecticut was very rocky, and this provides great places to hide<br/>
boxes. Long Island has some rocky areas, but this provides me with the<br/>
challenge to hide them well.<br/>
 This weekend we are going out to the Montauk Lighthouse on the south fork<br/>
of the Island. I promise this box will be a little more challenging than the<br/>
last two! I will post clues right away.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting<br/>
