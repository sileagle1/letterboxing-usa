SleepyHole Park in Suffolk, Va.  This is a Letterbox-Geocache <br/>
hybrid.  Geocachers can get their clues at www.geocaching.com and/or <br/>
www.navicache.com.<br/>
<br/>
The Fortress of Solitude<br/>
<br/>
1.  From the "Bat Cave" follow the trail until it ends.  From<br/>
that <br/>
point a compass reading of 225 degrees will take you to a spot to <br/>
watch the geese from a fence.<br/>
<br/>
2.  A short upwards travel on the stairs and a glance to the left and <br/>
you will notice one of the camping areas of the park.  Your path lies <br/>
in this direction.<br/>
<br/>
3.  As you come upon the camping grounds, there is a unique tree to <br/>
your right.  This tree was once two but grew together then split <br/>
again and has a really great "hollow" under it.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Keep travelling in the same direction that you have been and you <br/>
will notice a small green sign with a black arrow on it.  This sign <br/>
(located on the other side of the camping area) leads the way to what <br/>
you seek.<br/>
<br/>
5.  This trail will wind for about  of a mile.  Keep the water to <br/>
your left.  The trail will appear unkempt at points but there are <br/>
blaze orange tape markers along the trail to keep you on the path.<br/>
<br/>
6.  When you reach the electrical box, hang a left and take 95 steps <br/>
to a tree that grows as two on the right side of the path.  If you <br/>
reach the "tree graveyard" you've gone too far.<br/>
<br/>
7.  At this tree a compass reading of 45 degrees will point you to a <br/>
tree that has a hollow in it.  Stamp in and enjoy "The Fortress<br/>
of Solitude".  If you wish to participate in the geo-cache element,<br/>
you can trade a superhero item for one of the boxes contents and take <br/>
a picture with the camera in the box.<br/>
<br/>
8.  Re-hide better than you found and Keep on 'Boxin!<br/>
