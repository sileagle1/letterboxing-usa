Having just attended two gatherings (my second and third) with plans <br/>

I know there are no hard and fast rules but I was just wondering <br/>
what the general consensus is on this. After all, no real effort is <br/>

I call it as it is labeled - If it is an Event Stamp (like the <br/>
Pacific NorthWest and KMartha), I count it as an E.  Ditto with <br/>
the "official" Event stamp for that day.<br/>
<br/>
If it is a HH, I count it as an HH.<br/>
<br/>
If you have to ask some bizarre question of someone to get a stamp, <br/>
I'd call it as an F.<br/>
<br/>
If you stumble across a box of tofu with a stamp inside, I'd call it <br/>
as an F.<br/>
<br/>
If it is a personal traveler specific to one letterboxer, I'd call it <br/>
as an X.<br/>

I count HHs as finds, whether I find them in a box or on the picnic <br/>
table at a gathering. I think it's because I'm too lazy to keep track <br/>
of all these different numbers!  <br/>
<br/>
On the subject of HHs, does anyone add the HHs they have <br/>
launched to their P count?  So far I haven't, but maybe I should.  <br/>
I've only launched two HHs so far.<br/>

I'll add my two cents here as I am sure that other will as well.<br/>
<br/>
My counting is fairly simple to me.<br/>
<br/>
Places = We have actually placed that box.<br/>
<br/>
Finds = We have searched for and found that box.<br/>
<br/>
Adopted = We have adopted another box that someone else planted.<br/>
<br/>
Event = Actually event stamps, carved for an event, that we got while at the<br/>
event or that someone else has brought to an event. If we find it in the<br/>
wild, then it is a Find.<br/>
<br/>
eXchanges = We have exchanged stamps with another letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
Traveler - An actual traveling box. Not Hitchhikers.<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhiker - A actual hitchhiker that we have found or that was at an event.<br/>
If someone else is carrying the hitchhiker and allows us to stamp in, we<br/>
then count it as a HH.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But that's how we do it, not how it must be done, "Your mileage may vary."<br/>
(grin)<br/>
