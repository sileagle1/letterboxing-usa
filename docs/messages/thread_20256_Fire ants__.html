Fire ants are a South American variety that invaded the American <br/>
southland, starting in Mobile, AL.  They have very painful bites and <br/>
will swarm and attack.  When I lived in Houston, TX, we had a couple <br/>
hills in our backyard.  We gave them a wide birth (sp?) until my <br/>
housemate/landlord zapped them with some nasty stuff.<br/>

I live in south Louisiana.  I have a couple of fire-ant hills in <br/>
every square FOOT of my lawn!  We've spent about $500 so far this <br/>
year fighting them on about 8 acres.  It's a losing battle - for US, <br/>
not the ants...<br/>
<br/>
But one adapts to anything.  Come visit me and I'll teach you the <br/>
trick - you just don't ever stand still in one place. Neigbors <br/>
visiting at the fence look to all the world like a group of 3 year-<br/>
olds dancing about needing to pee.<br/>
<br/>
Then, there are the banana spiders - harmless but mucho creepy.  You <br/>
haven't truly freaked until you've driven your golf cart through a <br/>
web about 4 feet in diameter strung between two trees - containing a <br/>
spider the size of a jumbo shrimp...<br/>
<br/>
And the phantom yellow jackets that dive-bomb me invisibly at a <br/>
certain spot on my driveway when I go to get the mail, leaving a <br/>
wound that lasts for weeks (on me, at least) that looks like my <br/>
spouse beat me with a rubber hose.<br/>
<br/>
Mosquitos with West Nile, ticks with Lyme, armadillos that carry <br/>
leprosy, pygmy rattlers, copperheads, cottonmouth mocassins, -  I <br/>
could plant a whole series of boxes in my own back yard called "The <br/>
1001 Louisiana Creepy-Crawlies."<br/>

Happy hunting,<br/>

&gt; &gt; Fire ants are a South American variety that<br/>
&gt; invaded the American <br/>
&gt; &gt; southland, starting in Mobile, AL.  They have very<br/>
&gt; painful bites <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; will swarm and attack.  When I lived in Houston,<br/>

&gt; &gt; A couple of hills?  A COUPLE of HILLS????  LOL.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I live in south Louisiana.  I have a couple of<br/>
&gt; &gt; fire-ant hills in <br/>
&gt; &gt; every square FOOT of my lawn!  We've spent about<br/>
&gt; &gt; $500 so far this <br/>
&gt; &gt; year fighting them on about 8 acres.  It's a<br/>
&gt; losing<br/>
&gt; &gt; battle - for US, <br/>
&gt; &gt; not the ants...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But one adapts to anything.  Come visit me and<br/>
&gt; I'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; teach you the <br/>
&gt; &gt; trick - you just don't ever stand still in one<br/>
&gt; &gt; place. Neigbors <br/>
&gt; &gt; visiting at the fence look to all the world like a<br/>
&gt; &gt; group of 3 year-<br/>
&gt; &gt; olds dancing about needing to pee.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Then, there are the banana spiders - harmless but<br/>
&gt; &gt; mucho creepy.  You <br/>
&gt; &gt; haven't truly freaked until you've driven your<br/>
&gt; golf<br/>
&gt; &gt; cart through a <br/>
&gt; &gt; web about 4 feet in diameter strung between two<br/>
&gt; &gt; trees - containing a <br/>
&gt; &gt; spider the size of a jumbo shrimp...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And the phantom yellow jackets that dive-bomb me<br/>
&gt; &gt; invisibly at a <br/>
&gt; &gt; certain spot on my driveway when I go to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; mail, leaving a <br/>
&gt; &gt; wound that lasts for weeks (on me, at least) that<br/>
&gt; &gt; looks like my <br/>
&gt; &gt; spouse beat me with a rubber hose.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mosquitos with West Nile, ticks with Lyme,<br/>
&gt; &gt; armadillos that carry <br/>
&gt; &gt; leprosy, pygmy rattlers, copperheads, cottonmouth<br/>
&gt; &gt; mocassins, -  I <br/>
