Wow!  Great job pruning!  More than 24 hours and no signs of poison ivy on <br/>
one of us (we all take turns retrieving and replacing the boxes).  Thanks <br/>
for going that extra mile!  BeMa<br/>

&gt;I'm so glad you liked the Easter Bunny series. After finding out<br/>
&gt;that the poison ivy came out after the boxes were planted, I went<br/>
&gt;back with my clippers and did some pruning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The dam trail follows the river up stream and can get very muddy. It<br/>
&gt;starts at the parking lot but goes the opposite way of the easter<br/>
&gt;bunny. With all of this rain, I bet they are releasing water from<br/>
&gt;the top of the dam, so I'm off to check out the waterfall.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks Firefly for helping them out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It certainly felt like Easter time with all these April (I mean<br/>
&gt;May)<br/>
&gt; &gt; showers!...  Running out during what may be the only "just<br/>
&gt;disgustingly<br/>
&gt; &gt; overcast and not actually raining" time during the weekend we went<br/>
&gt;seeking<br/>
&gt; &gt; the bunny and his friends.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It's amazing how a semi-urban trail can still make you feel like<br/>
&gt;your out in<br/>
&gt; &gt; nature.  The birds were really singing.  And, except for right by<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; underpass, they were the only noise you heard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We really enjoyed this series.  The clues were very clear and the<br/>
&gt;hiding<br/>
&gt; &gt; places specific.  Plus, all those great benches!!  What a luxury<br/>
&gt;to sit and<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp in!  The bunny, his basket, egg and peeps were all in great<br/>
&gt;shape.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Noting the caution against mud and stream crossings in the second<br/>
&gt;half of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the series, we decided to call it a day after the first four.  We<br/>
&gt;walked<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to the lot along main street, admiring all the funky stuff in<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; various store windows.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; QUESTION:  Where does the dam trail start?  Does one continue down<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; gravel path or do we need to go down the other paved path back at<br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; parking lot?  We weren't sure.  We would love to come back and<br/>
&gt;look for<br/>
&gt; &gt; those boxes once the land has had a chance to dry up.  Thanks!<br/>
