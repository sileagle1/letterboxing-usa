   Below you will find details about a box that RIBNAG and friends <br/>
planted on Earth Day '01 in western Mass. I hope you can visit it <br/>
soon. Enjoy!<br/>

**********************begin clues************************************<br/>
<br/>
The Craggy Knoll Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
If possible you should try to do this box within the next two weeks. <br/>
The wild flowers will blow you away. It is worth the drive.<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the east, take the Mass Pike west until you are <br/>
almost in New York. Take Rt 7 south through Great Barrington and <br/>
Sheffield. Once into Ashley Falls watch for the sign for the right <br/>
hand turn towards Bartholomew's Cobble. Follow the signs to the <br/>
cobble.<br/>
<br/>
Bartholomew's Cobble is a National Natural Landmark that is <br/>
maintained by the Trustees of Reservations. A donation is requested <br/>
at the natural history center at the entrance.<br/>
<br/>
Explore the cobble carefully. This box was placed very carefully to <br/>
minimize the potential for plant squishage.<br/>
<br/>
At the entrance, follow the Ledge Trail to the right. Check out the <br/>
cave. I saw some Marchantia on a small rock on the path to <br/>
the cave. <br/>
Return to the Ledge Trail and follow it until you reach the Craggy <br/>
Knoll Trail on the left. Follow the CKT up the hill and around the <br/>
bend. You should be able to see the river ahead, down to the right as <br/>
you come around the bend. Look for the table rock on your immediate <br/>
right. Five paces along the trail from the table rock. By your left <br/>
foot the box resides. PLEASE use great care so that the small green <br/>
creatures in front of the box's home are not damaged. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy the cobble. It is one of the most amazing places <br/>
that I have experienced.<br/>
