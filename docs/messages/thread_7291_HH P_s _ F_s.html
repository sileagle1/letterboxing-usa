P only to the person who made the stamp and originally planted it.<br/>
F counts only once, unless, A. it has changed location B. it is in a <br/>
box you havent been to before. I would think you would count it in a <br/>
personal maintenance call on one of your boxes. I know that <br/>
contadicts but my reasoning is that why would you return to another <br/>
box, you know where it is, if you go it would have to be because <br/>
someone showed you a new area and you wanted to go back, or check <br/>
out any recent visitors. That doesn't count, unless the box moved <br/>
changed location, and clues. So unless all that changed you wouldn't <br/>
count that box. Hard to pass up a stamp but how could you count it, <br/>
I could visit 3 boxes (that I know of everyday without getting in a <br/>
car) looking for a HH. Part of the fun of letterboxing is the <br/>
mystery so my thought would be leave it there for the next person, <br/>
if it is there for a while then maybe think of moving it, but the ? <br/>
of does it count as a F would arise again. I dunno, just my opinion, <br/>
and it could go back and forth forever, a guideline would be nice! <br/>
lol.<br/>
