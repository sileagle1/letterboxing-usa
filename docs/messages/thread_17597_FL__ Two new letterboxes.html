&gt; If one is not near you, consider planting one yourself<br/>
&gt; <br/>
Yes, please!   (Speaking for the permanent-resident letterboxers of Southeast <br/>
Florida, here!)   We're trying to plant them, but we'd be grateful to anyone <br/>
who wants to plant another.<br/>
<br/>
I don't get down to Miami *too* often, but when I do and when I can run by <br/>
boxes, you can certainly count on me to fix anything that's wrong.   And if you <br/>
get a report of something wrong with a box you've planted around here, you can <br/>
let me know and we'll do our best to get someone down there to check on it.   <br/>
