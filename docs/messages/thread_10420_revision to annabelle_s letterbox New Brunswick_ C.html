Annabelle's Walk Letterbox<br/>
Location: Campobello Island, New Brunswick - just over the bridge from <br/>
Lubec, Maine<br/>
Trail: Easy<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
Planted by: TwoMaineCats and their niece Ashley and cousin Robyn.<br/>
Annabelle Jane Fletcher was our aunt and most importantly our friend. We <br/>
place this<br/>
letterbox on her island where she was born, raised and lived. She worked <br/>
faithfully at<br/>
Roosevelt Park in the "Prince Cottage" for many years. Make sure you stop by <br/>
the park<br/>
for a visit. It is free of charge and she would have loved to show you <br/>
around "her park".<br/>
We made this walk with Aunt Belle many times. I am sure you can still hear <br/>
us giggling<br/>
and chatting if you listen close enough.<br/>

Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Cross the bridge from Lubec, Maine to Campobello, Island, New Brunswick, <br/>
Canada.<br/>
Stop at the border crossing (note: this is not a toll booth, many people <br/>
think it is! You are<br/>
entering Canada - the border officials are really nice - just tell them you <br/>
are visiting<br/>
Roosevelt Park for the day - dont forget identification i.e. drivers <br/>
license, birth certificate<br/>
etc.)<br/>
After you pass through the border, take the main road to Roosevelt Park. <br/>
Roosevelt Park<br/>
will be on your left. Directly across from the Park entrance is a dirt road <br/>
called the Park<br/>
Natural Area (note: this sign is taken down in the fall but you should not <br/>
have any trouble<br/>
finding the road). Turn onto the dirt road and drive 1.5 miles exactly. Turn <br/>
into the<br/>
parking lot to the boardwalk which is called the "Observation Deck and <br/>
Walkway". (on<br/>
your right)<br/>
Go either right or left enjoying your walk along the boardwalk.  You will <br/>
eventually see a<br/>
path that leads to an observation deck (it will be on your left if you <br/>
walked left at the<br/>
entrance or it will be on your right if you took a right at the entrance). <br/>
Walk along the<br/>
path and stop when you see the flight of stairs which leads to an <br/>
observation deck (note:<br/>
there are a few stairways along this path). Don't go up the stairs just yet. <br/>
Stand at the base<br/>
of the steps and look left. Walk about 10 paces and look under the <br/>
boulders/ledge. Look<br/>
underneath the rocks, and you'll find your treasure. Now walk up to the <br/>
observation deck<br/>
and enjoy the view!!<br/>
