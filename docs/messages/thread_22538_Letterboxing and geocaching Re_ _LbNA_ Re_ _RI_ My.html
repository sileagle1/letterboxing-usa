I've continued this discussion. I think this is an<br/>
opportunity to discuss geocaching and letterboxing<br/>
issues and perhaps come up with ways that the 2<br/>
hobbies can work together. <br/>
<br/>
I think the adage, "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"<br/>
(or at least 'work with 'em') could apply. As both<br/>
games expand they are bound to meet and sometimes<br/>
collide. I would like to see more harmony between the<br/>
two. If more geocachers are informed about what<br/>
letterboxing is and encouraged to become letterboxers,<br/>
then it stands to reason that fewer letterboxes will<br/>
have their stamps traded out. <br/>
