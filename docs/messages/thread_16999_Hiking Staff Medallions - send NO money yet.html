                    <div class="plaintext-content">Looks like there is a good bit of interest in the medallions.  I have <br/>
some info from The Hermann Werks, Inc.  www.thewerks.com<br/>
<br/>
The minimum order is 12.  Prices will vary depending on how many we <br/>
order.  They also charge a fee if the art needs to be redrawn.  I <br/>
anticipate the cost can be kept low, just a few dollars including <br/>
shipping.<br/>
<br/>
The medallions are either engraved or full color images sublimated on <br/>
aluminum.  I will try to scan some of the samples they sent.  I also <br/>
will need to check on their current prices.<br/>
<br/>
Keep your eyes on the list this weekend as that is likely when I will <br/>
put up the exact info.<br/>
<br/>
I would have prefered the relief type that you can get from <br/>
www.hikeamerica.com but these seem nice also.<br/>
