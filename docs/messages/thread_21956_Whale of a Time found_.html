hmm, sound like a song. Well, it wasnt found where it was supposed to<br/>
be. It was found by an 11 yr old geocacher who very kindly emailed me.<br/>
She said she could try to place it.<br/>
I am so glad, and hope it does get back to where its clues say it<br/>
should be.<br/>

Had lots of fun this weekend 'boxing' with the kids. Went out in the<br/>
rain, which was fun, but I have to agree with Funhog, I now know<br/>
boxing in the rain isnt the best, as we had to be concerned about<br/>
anything getting wet.<br/>
<br/>
It was an experieince for my kids.<br/>
Hey they learned about stinging nettle, oops.<br/>
The hard way, thank goodness its effects do not last too long. That<br/>
was a real hands on botony lesson. tee hee.<br/>
Also found some cool forked branch lichen which my daughter was able<br/>
to identify from our book. She'll be a naturalist yet.<br/>
