I agree with this sentiment. I've participated in family chats on e-groups <br/>
and found it to be quite satisfactory. I would participate.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the other discussion goes, I see both points but I think missing <br/>
reports should only be reported by the originator. I've had difficulties <br/>
finding boxes before and in each case it was my own stupidity. I think it <br/>
would be bad form if I was allowed to report someone elses box as missing <br/>
when it was my brain that went missing.<br/>
