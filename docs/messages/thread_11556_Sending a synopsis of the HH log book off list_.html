The best of all worlds -- going to check one's own box and reading all the <br/>
great notes AND finding a HH!  This is how we found two out of the three HH <br/>
we've found.<br/>
<br/>
We always post when the find a box or a HH (I guess we're real chatty).  We <br/>
so enjoy knowing that someone has found our boxes that we are just guessing <br/>
that others feel the same way.  If not, they can just skip the entry.<br/>
<br/>
One person whose HH we had found read our posting and emailed us off list to <br/>
ask us to email them the comments from the logbook.  In this way, they got a <br/>
date by date description of where the HH had been, who had found it, etc.  <br/>
Maybe others can do this for the planter when they find a HH (or at least <br/>
offer to).  It seems so many people miss hearing what has happened to their <br/>
creation.  Maybe this is another solution.  BeMa<br/>

&gt; &gt; I've actually decided to stop making the darned things<br/>
&gt; &gt; since so few people seem interested in letting the creator know of<br/>
&gt; &gt; their whereabouts. For me, that's (or would have been) a major part<br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the fun: knowing where my little stamps have traveled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'm with you on that!  I realize that boxing is a bit slow here in my<br/>
&gt;part of the world, but even those that have been placed in other<br/>
&gt;states, where the log books indicated a more regular stream of<br/>
&gt;visitors, have never again been heard from... (not in e-mail or on<br/>
&gt;the P&amp;W HH list).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of the things I like about this hobby is going out every so often<br/>
&gt;to check on my boxes and seeing the stamps of those who have been<br/>
&gt;there and where they are from, etc.  Can't do that with a HH.  Even<br/>
&gt;for most of the boxes I have placed out of state, I have been<br/>
&gt;fortunate to get e-mail updates when they are found.  Not so with<br/>
&gt;HH's.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I echo your sentiments...  There isn't much incentive to put out a<br/>
&gt;HH, other than the fact that I know people like to find them.  But<br/>
&gt;from a selfish perspective, I'd rather spend my time carving a stamp<br/>
&gt;for a "regular" letterbox.<br/>
