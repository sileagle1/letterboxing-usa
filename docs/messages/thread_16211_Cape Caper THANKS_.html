Please add our thanks and appreciation to Mary Manatee and The <br/>
Yachtsman for hosting the Cape Caper. Our family had a terrific time <br/>
and enjoyed meeting some new faces and putting faces with trailnames.<br/>
We stayed over and continued boxing today and ran into Solar and <br/>
Binx, Mary Manatee and The Yachtsman, and Tweety and Mr. Coon during <br/>
our searches today. We wound up our visit with The Ghost Train <br/>
letterbox which was a fun change of pace!<br/>
The weekend really helped our box count, though we really didn't put <br/>
a dent in the number of boxes that can be found on Cape Cod!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks from Cavy Lovers, Fluff and Cromat<br/>
