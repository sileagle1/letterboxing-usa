                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi.  This is in response to the person who asked recently if rubber cement <br/>
would hold up in the long run for affixing a carved eraser to a piece of <br/>
wood backing.  In my experience the answer is no.  Yesterday I checked on <br/>
the 3 letterboxes that I have at Wendell State Forest (MA).  I used rubber <br/>
cement to affix the wood backing to the stamp on all 3 of them.  They are a <br/>
little over a year old and the backing has come off the eraser on 2 of them.<br/>
<br/>
In some boxes that I've found the eraser/stamp has no backing at all and <br/>
that seems to work just fine, given how thick the erasers are.  But if <br/>
anyone has used some other glue that has stood the test of time and <br/>
temperature fluctuations, let us know!<br/>
