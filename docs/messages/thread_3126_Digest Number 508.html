<br/>
I started letterboxing in May with my 5 year old twins and a now 7 month <br/>
old.  We've now found over 50, and I've lost lots of weight!  My 7 month old <br/>
usually travels in a Gerry backpack which has a simple aluminum frame.  It's <br/>
got a pouch with 2 leg holes for the baby and a strap that goes around his <br/>
middle.  I started with him in it when he was 4 month old.  They do need to <br/>
be able to hold up their head to ride in it.  He has always loved it and <br/>
falls asleep in it frequently.  I also have an LL Bean backpack that is more <br/>
substantial.  I've tried it once but didn't have it adjusted correctly.  The <br/>
people I have talked to have used this for older "babies" and have <br/>
recommended it.  Please feel free to e-mail me directly if you have more <br/>
questions.<br/>

<br/>
I guess this is a good group to ask...does anyone have any recommendations<br/>
on good kiddie backpacks for letterboxing?  We have a 2.5 year old, and<br/>
another one on the way (due March).  Up til now, Nora has been riding on<br/>
Dad's shoulders, but that's getting kind of old.  I'd love some<br/>
recommedations from the "pros".<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Ann in MA<br/>
