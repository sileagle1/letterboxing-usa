                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wanted to reintroduce the subject of exchanging letterboxes with<br/>
Dartmoor.  I'm sorry I let the ball drop when I brought the subject up<br/>
earlier.  Some health things were going on and my internet connection<br/>
/ modem went on the blink and then finally quit (I'm connected again).<br/>
<br/>
This is a really thrilling exchange opportunity to have some of our<br/>
boxes on real Dartmoor land <excited dance="" happy=""> and have boxes from<br/>
the "letterbox motherland" here.  Here is history and a letterbox<br/>
hybrid in the making.  <br/>
<br/>
This group is full of creative boxers and what needs to be discussed &amp;<br/>
decided on is: <br/>
1) a theme. <br/>
2) what type clues you want written for the boxes planted in<br/>
Dartmoor.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll be the gathering point for the boxes being shipped and received.<br/>
 So all you need to do is get your box to me, and be willing to pay<br/>
for postage to receive a Dartmoor box from me.  Oh, just no lead balls<br/>
in the boxes going to the UK. :-)  <br/>

<br/>
I figured (and hoped) the older members would have the best ideas on<br/>
this since they've been boxing longest and have a better sense of<br/>
LbNA's history and foundation. But new members please don't feel<br/>
excluded from offering ideas because this is open.  <br/>
