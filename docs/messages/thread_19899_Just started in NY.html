Hope you enjoy your adventures!  You're absolutely correct about it <br/>
being a great activity for the entire family (&amp; the price is <br/>
certainly right!) Don't forget to check out the Newboxer talk list <br/>
as well.  It's an invaluable resource for all of your questions.<br/>

Other than that, get out there &amp; have fun &amp; remember to rehide those <br/>
boxes well!  :)<br/>

It's amazing how much this will add just a bit of spice to traveling.  For a first planting, I'd suggest something nearby, so you can get used to doing maintenance and getting (hopefully) e-mail updates on folks visiting it.  The hard part is to *not* check the box every day to see if anyone found it yet!  :)<br/>
Pick a spot you like to visit yourself.  Then gather the tools.  A box big enough to hold a hitchhiker is always nice, too - say, a Rubbermaid B or C.  It adds to the number of 'visitors'.<br/>

  We have just started Letterboxing on the fourth of this month. A<br/>
  friend of mine in WA has been telling me how wonderful letterboxing is<br/>
  for a couple of years now. We were looking for something fun to do<br/>
  with our five children that wouldn't cost a whole lot, and decided to<br/>
  get started with letterboxing which we have been wanting to do for<br/>
  some time. We travel all over the US and I wish that we had started<br/>
  earlier.<br/>
<br/>
  We have found three boxes so far. The first two were in our area and<br/>
  even though we have lived here almost our entire lives, the clues led<br/>
  us to beautiful places that we didn't even know excisted. The kids<br/>
  loved it, and told their cousins in VA aboout it! I told my mother and<br/>
  brother about it, and they just went on their first hunt the other day!<br/>
<br/>
  I just wanted to thank those who went through the work of placing the<br/>
  boxes and writing up the clues. We want to place a box too, but I want<br/>
  to give it a lot of thought first.<br/>
