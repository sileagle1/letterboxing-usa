aimlessly around New Jersey last night trying to find lodging under <br/>
$125. What a trip!  So here's our report:<br/>
<br/>
6/26/04 - Found South of the Border (aka Pedro) in fine shape. Only <br/>
problem is that its right in the middle of a rather large patch of <br/>
poison ivy!  Yikes! Bring the Technu! <br/>
<br/>
Rest of the week (did not have a watch on!):<br/>
<br/>
Myrtle Beach Shell Collection: Great shape. If there's kids on the <br/>
little boardwalk just have someone distract them asking for <br/>
directions to the Pavillion!  My father in law did a great job! <br/>
<br/>
Sculptured Oak:  Both in great shape! Thanks Jay and Margaret! We <br/>
placed one between these 2 boxes, look for it soon! <br/>
<br/>
The Sand Dollar:  North Myrtle, unpublished, soon-to-be-published-<br/>
hopefully.  Got our first ever first find! Yay! Awesome box, nice lil <br/>
park. <br/>
<br/>
And over the week we transplanted 3 hitchers from CT to SC. <br/>
