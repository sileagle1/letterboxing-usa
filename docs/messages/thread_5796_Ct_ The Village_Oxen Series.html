                    <div class="plaintext-content">Day four in a great summer adventure in the walk of generations as <br/>
our family came from Killingly to Mansfield in 1772 and we recreate <br/>
it now in 2002. Two teams of oxen and two boys and Mom walking the <br/>
miles to home. Today we came from the natchaug river at Bassetts <br/>
Bridge Rd. in Chaplin to the Mansfield Hollow park. To find the <br/>
village letterbox  come along and park at the main park entrance on  <br/>
the road here - not the boat launch.  We stopped here for a picnic <br/>
lunch and met with quite a few other letterboxers. From the drive way <br/>
look across the road and see the red trail . Your adventure is short <br/>
compared to ous and you will be well rewarded. Carefully cross the <br/>
road and enter the trail. Into a pine forest  think of how the early <br/>
settlers of Mansfield used trees such as this for houses , barns , <br/>
bridges, fences. And sold them for  ships masts too. Walk into the <br/>
forested path  for 27 adult paces. Look for a really tall pine. From <br/>
that head North to a 5 foot tall broken stump &amp; piece of tree.  The <br/>
village as drawn in Barbers  Sketch book of early Ct.  has become  a <br/>
little piece of stamp and is hidden under large pieces of bark. Color <br/>
the stamp with the markers in box and breathe on it just before you <br/>
stamp it and you will see the village that Boaz Stearns walked to in <br/>
1772. Please rehide exactley so others may enjoy this piece of <br/>
history in Mansfield . Thanks to all those who helped hide this box <br/>
today on the oxen drive.  Leader of the Pack <br/>
