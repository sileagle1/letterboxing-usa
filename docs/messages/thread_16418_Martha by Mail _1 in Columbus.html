good health, her logbook is a bit disheveled(the butterfly is torn).  She<br/>
took one look at my house and thought that maybe jail WOULD be better.  She<br/>
is set to meet my letterboxing neighbor bookbug and  will be stamped up this<br/>
evening and sent on her way......Whoever has her next better have their<br/>
Halloween decorations up, she's a real stickler about that stuff :)<br/>
