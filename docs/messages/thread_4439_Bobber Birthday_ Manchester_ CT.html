Manchester, CT<br/>
Placed 1/31/02 by most of the Varrell family, including Jesse (7 yrs),<br/>
Leah (3 yrs), and their mom, Debbie, in celebration of dad's 38th<br/>
birthday<br/>
<br/>
Happy birthday, Scott!<br/>
<br/>
I-84 to exit 60.  From I-84 eastbound, take a right onto Middle Turnpike.<br/>
 From I-84 westbound, take a left onto Middle Turnpike.  Travel under<br/>
power lines and turn right to park at Laurel Marsh Trail, part of the<br/>
Hockanum River Linear Trail.<br/>
<br/>
This is a marshy area with boardwalks for easy travel, best visited in<br/>
bug-free seasons or with heavy duty bug spray in your arsenal.<br/>
<br/>
Accessible trail is .75 mile loop<br/>
Laurel Marsh Trail is 3.5 mile loop<br/>
<br/>
For either trail, start by heading right and walking under the power<br/>
lines.  Stairs ahead for launching a boat to catch those fishies.  Bear<br/>
left and follow along the Hockanum River.  <br/>
<br/>
Option 1:  For the Laurel Marsh Trail (3.5 mi.), turn right and go over<br/>
the arched bridge, following the signs.  Stay on this trail for the<br/>
majority of the 3.5 miles, rejoining the accessible trail after passing<br/>
the water treatment station and continuing on, with a right turn just<br/>
before a bench, and picking up with the clues at * below.<br/>
<br/>
Option 2:  For the accessible trail (0.75 mi.), continue straight. <br/>
Travel over three wooden bridges and past many fishing nooks.  Turn away<br/>
from the Hockanum River to follow Hop Brook.  At a fork in the trail,<br/>
just past a bench, bear left to stay on the accessible trail.<br/>
<br/>
* 	As you turn away from the water and into the woods, go over one<br/>
boardwalk.  From the end of the boardwalk, take a number of paces<br/>
(counting left foot only) equal to Jesse's age.  Turn right onto<br/>
red-blazed Olcott Street Trail and follow the bumpety, rooty path for 28<br/>
paces (paces, not steps! Count left foot only).  Turn right and take a<br/>
number of paces equal to Leah's age.  The total of these sets of paces<br/>
equal's Scott's age.  Here you will see a family of four healthy<br/>
individuals growing together from a strong base.  The Bobber Birthday<br/>
letterbox is nestled into a nook at the base.  If you reach the boardwalk<br/>
on this trail, you've gone too far.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping in and rehiding the box well, return down the rooty,<br/>
bumpety path to the accessible trail.  Turn right and travel over one<br/>
boardwalk.  Bear left at fork to return to the parking lot.<br/>
