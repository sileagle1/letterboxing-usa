                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just an FYI - the default for comments on Atlas Quest is set to "Moderate all comments before publishing", i.e. the owner of the box has to approve the comment before it is made public. If they do not read their email or respond to email or choose not to make the comment public it does not get displayed. <br/>
<br/>
I checked and the box is not listed on AQ and neither are the letterbox hiders.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing that could be done, is to post the warning on the 'Letterboxing Virginia' board at: http://www.atlasquest.com/boards/messages.html?gBoardId=283<br/>
I could not find another regional Virginia letterboxing group. <br/>

            If it's listed on AQ you can leave a public comment about the box when you<br/>
<br/>
log it in as a find.<br/>
