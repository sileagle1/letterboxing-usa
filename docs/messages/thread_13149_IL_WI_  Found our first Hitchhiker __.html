                    <div class="plaintext-content">we were in IL on our way to a ballgame and stopped at the IL State Beach to<br/>
search for Matt the Rat's Dead River Letterbox ... excellent hiding place,<br/>
btw, matt, and a fun search during this past beautiful weekend.  We were so<br/>
excited to find our very first hitchhiker in this box, the "Peek A Boo"<br/>
stamp originally from the Apple Dumpling Gang in VA.  Our kids thought we<br/>
were pretty silly getting so excited about this find  - but we were<br/>
practically giddy :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we continued boxing the rest of the weekend in our own state, so the<br/>
hitchhiker has moved on and moved north :)<br/>
