No Fooling!<br/>

Postpone your search for this one.  When I came home today, the box (or <br/>
what was left of it) was in my front door.  A critter had chewed off a <br/>
corner of the stamp and the log book was soaked through:(  This was the <br/>
first letterbox that I put out back in January of 2002.  Lots of cool <br/>
old sigs in there.  Lots lost to the H2O.  Not sure about when I'll get <br/>
around to replacing it. 3 years is a pretty good run.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Warrior Woman, who rescued it and got it back to me.<br/>
<br/>
