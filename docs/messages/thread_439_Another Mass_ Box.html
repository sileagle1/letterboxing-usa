&gt; Greetings all!  Boy, has spring arrived here in western Massachusetts!  It's <br/>
&gt; sunny and in the 70s!!!!  Yesterday I checked on my letterboxes in Wendell <br/>
&gt; State Forest and replaced the one that had a cracked lid.  Turns out that in <br/>
&gt; addition to Tom Cooch, some mysterious person with a very cool abstract <br/>
&gt; stamp found both boxes on Friday.  They didn't leave their name, hmmmm.  <br/>
&gt; perhaps it was a celebrity letterboxer?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In any case, I wanted to let you faithful list readers know that I've hidden <br/>
&gt; a third box on the Metacomet-Monadnock trail in Wendell State Forest.  It is <br/>
&gt; dedicated to Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the French aviator and author, and <br/>
&gt; the stamp (I hope) will bring a smile to anyone who has read The Little <br/>
&gt; Prince.  The first five people to find the box can take home a <br/>
&gt; glow-in-the-dark star, as a little bonus.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I've decided not to put the clue for Letterbox Saint-Ex on the Web.  <br/>
&gt; Instead, I'm putting the clue inside the first box on the trail (Letterbox <br/>
&gt; El Corazon)e.  I'll also put it in other boxes I hide or in boxes that I <br/>
&gt; find.  I like the idea of boxes leading to more boxes.  Is anyone else doing <br/>
&gt; this?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is the last box I'm hiding at Wendell State Forest.  I think 3 is <br/>
&gt; enough.  Time to scout out another good location.  Dan, if you want to, just <br/>
&gt; mention on the Mass. page that there is a third box hidden on the <br/>
&gt; Metacomet-Monadnock trail and that the clue can be found in one of the other <br/>
&gt; letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope you're all having a GREAT weekend--<br/>
&gt; Bonnie<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to another trip to Wendell, Bonnie. St. Exupery is one <br/>
of my favorite authors!<br/>

I should have mentioned in my original post that Tom's personal stamp, the <br/>
Orient Express, is a masterpiece!  A beautful piece of work and really <br/>
something worth seeing.  If he has visited one of your boxes, you owe it to <br/>
yourself to check out his stamp.<br/>

&gt;A great concept!  And like Tom, an added reason to get t western Mass.<br/>
&gt;Maybe soon.<br/>

&gt;Re your clue: did you make several copies of the clue instructions, so<br/>
&gt;that the only one won't be as likely to travel?<br/>

Here's how I did that Bonnie.  I put the following on your clues page:<br/>
<br/>
Bonus Letterbox - Another letterbox (not listed here) is hidden on the<br/>
Metacomet-Monadnock trail in Wendell State Forest.  The clues can be<br/>
found in one of the above letterboxes.  This bonus letterbox is<br/>
dedicated<br/>
to Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the French aviator and author.  The <br/>
stamp may bring a smile to anyone who has read The Little Prince.  The<br/>
first five people to find the box can take home a glow-in-the-dark star,<br/>
as a little bonus.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if that works for you. -Dan<br/>
