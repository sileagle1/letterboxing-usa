I work at this beautiful, natural area, so I must stress that the trails are <br/>
open from dawn to dusk and are free for members of Mass Audubon with their <br/>
card. There is a nominal trail fee for non-membersâ€¦$4 for adults, $2 for <br/>
children and seniors. Maps are available at the nature center from 9 a.m. to <br/>
5 p.m. weekdays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekends. Stop in at the nature center <br/>
and sign in. The staff and volunteers can set you on the right trail.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A downloadable version of the map and driving directions are also available <br/>
at the Moose Hill website (www.massaudubon.org/moosehill).<br/>
