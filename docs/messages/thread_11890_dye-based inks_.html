                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dye ink dries very quickly but most of it is not very moisture resistant.  Pinkment inks, once dry, are considered almost waterproof but take a very long time to dry and will smudge.  Each has its advantages; each has its disadvantages.  I tend to use pigment because I can get little Cat's Eyes that don't take up much room and I can travel with lots of colors in my backpack.  But I do also take along tissues or paper towels to try to blot as much excess ink as possible before closing a log book.  I don't use my pigment ink on a page that is facing someone else's stamp image.  Hope this helps a bit.Memlili<br/>
