<br/>
SBUX Lucy Black has lost contact with her family. She is 21 years old. Her <br/>
home is in Lancaster Pennsylvania. Her parents are Kevin and Lynn Black.<br/>
<br/>
She is a senior at Lancaster Bible College. Her VW Beetle car was found <br/>
unlocked with keys in the ignition near her home. She works as part-time as <br/>
a counselor at an alcoholic rehabilitation facility near her home.<br/>
<br/>
She left work on Thursday afternoon Dec. 30, 2004 at 3;30 PM about 90 <br/>
minutes early. A typewritten note was found on the VW windshield.<br/>
<br/>
She is not considered a missing person yet since she is 21 years old.<br/>

Our many Prayers go out to the Black Family!<br/>
