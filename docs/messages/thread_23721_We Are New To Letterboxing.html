<br/>
Our family (The Jeep Creeps) will be going on our first Letterboxing <br/>
adventure this weekend.  We live in a little town, in the <br/>
south eastern part of Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
A great article about Letterboxing was printed in the Family Fun <br/>
Magazine, Sept. 2006 Issue and it sparked up some great memories.<br/>
<br/>
A few years back, my brother-in-law, introduced me to geocaching.  We <br/>
had a great time with him and my niece and nephew.  I haven't been out <br/>
on a "treasure hunt" in a long time, but I have never forgotten how fun <br/>
it was.  Thats why I am so excited to get my kids involved with <br/>
Letterboxing now.  I do not have a geocaching device, so i am hoping <br/>
good old fun and map reading will do...  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for inviting us in to your group.<br/>

Over dinner tonight... we gave the news to the kids..<br/>
and checked out a few areas around us on the map.<br/>
Each kid got their own journal books and stamps... <br/>
so of course they had to try them out.. :)<br/>
Hope we have good weather this weekend <br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
