This is really sad. My husband did the first part of that series last October and we always meant to get back there and finish it. Now I am sorry that we didn't. We attempted to find the first 6 boxes; only one of them seemed to be missing, and at the time we thought it was just our own incompetence, but perhaps that one had been stolen. There were some truly beautiful stamps in that series. I hope you have luck reclaiming the lost ones.  --- On Sun 07/22, Dave &amp; Deanne &lt; dave.deanne@verizon.net &gt; wrote:From: Dave &amp; Deanne [mailto: dave.deanne@verizon.net]To: letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.comDate: Sun, 22 Jul 2007 16:30:35 -0400Subject: Re: [LbNA] To the Groton/waterford LB thief                  what a shame, there were some great boxes there, which ones survived?the lazy letterboxer  ----- Original Message -----   From: Kelli   To: letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com   Sent: Sunday, July 22, 2007 4:25 PM  Subject: [LbNA] To the Groton/waterford LB thiefI went to Bluff <br/>
