                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Le Plume marker I have here has two tips.  One is a fine tip, and one is <br/>
a bigger tip, which is better for coloring stamps.  We have numerous boxes <br/>
here in CT with LePlume markers in them for creating multi color stamp images.  <br/>
Moonstone Baby even has a multi color image for her personal stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Whether its water based or dye based... it doesn't say on the pen, but it is <br/>
acid free and non-toxic, which may tell you something (I have NO idea!).  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps a tad!<br/>

hi<br/>
<br/>
as far as i know Le Plume markers are water based.....i dont think they come in a pigment....youre best bet would be using waterbased inks...not pigment ink since it takes for ever to dry....<br/>
<br/>
the le plume pens with the dual tips i have a set of and the tiny tip end tends to not work that great after awhile but the broad tip end works nicely....just be sure after you color up the stamp...work fast and then when done be sure to do a big "huff" (as u would do to fog up a window in the winter) then press onto paper....<br/>
<br/>
the le plume pens come in dffferent set styles/shades i.e. pastels, victorian, etc...and you can purchase them individually.....<br/>
<br/>
this probably didnt help you any...;)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the info.  I think the LePlume markers do come in different types<br/>
(at least from looking at info on the Internet they seem to).  I'm<br/>
concerned, based on reading some things, including some comments on the<br/>
message board, that if I use water-based markers the images will tend to<br/>
fade over time.<br/>
