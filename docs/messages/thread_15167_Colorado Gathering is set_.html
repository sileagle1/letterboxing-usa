                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay Gang!  We're going to have our very first gathering!  I hope you <br/>
all can attend! <br/>
<br/>
Date:  8/23/03 (That would be NEXT Saturday)<br/>
Time:  11am  <br/>
Location:  Roxborough Park Visitor's Center<br/>
There is a small fee to enter this Colorado State Park, unless you <br/>
have a state park pass.  I believe it is $6. <br/>
<br/>
There are two boxes (currently) located at Roxborough.  Fountain <br/>
Valley and Foot Loose.  Check for clues on the LbNA website.  <br/>
Potluck -- Let's bring a small dish to share!<br/>
Exchanges!<br/>
Boxing! <br/>
I even carved an event stamp for all those who attend!  :) <br/>
<br/>
This will be a great time to meet each other, exchange stamps, hunt <br/>
for the boxes in this park, plant some new boxes, and feast!<br/>
If anyone would like to demonstrate a microbox, stamp carving, or any <br/>
other such thing, that would be welcome!  <br/>
