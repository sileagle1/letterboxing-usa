When I first started carving I thought that I had to mount my stamps<br/>
and I used plexiglass so that they couldn't warp and I don't remember<br/>
what glue. Now 75+ stamps later I figured out that not only is it less<br/>
hassle/space to leave them unmounted but I prefer stamping with them<br/>
unmounted as I get a much better impression. [I use Dick Blick's<br/>
Soft-kut, similar but cheaper than speedball's pink stuff]<br/>

&gt; Being new to carving my own stamps can anyone tell me what the <br/>
&gt; best "glue" is for sticking the rubber stamp to a wooden mounting <br/>
&gt; block ?<br/>
