<br/>
Welcome to the insanity!  You may want to check out the other Yahoo <br/>
group, especially for New letterboxers:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
No question is too silly to ask there - several "veteran" boxers are <br/>
standing by to answer your queries!<br/>
<br/>
There are also regional lists...where are you located?<br/>
