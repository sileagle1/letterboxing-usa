Steeplechase that was placed at the same time in Nashville by Aryn <br/>
and Jason. We are just in town for a few days and want to know if we <br/>
were close but perhaps barking up the wrong tree! We are not saying <br/>
it is missing, just that we were unable to locate it... definitely <br/>
willing to go back and try again... it won't be the first time we <br/>
have not found a box on the first try... or second try... It is just <br/>
that our time is a little shorter this time! If anyone knows <br/>
anything about the status of this box please feel free to email me <br/>
offlist at aou1998@yahoo.com<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
