<br/>
After reading all the posts on dye vs. pigment ink, and stories of wet,  <br/>
waterlogged boxes, I'm getting a little worried: As a new letterbox  <br/>
placer (I'm on my second,) I'm wondering two things: 1) Should I expect  <br/>
my newly placed letterbox to get messed up pretty quickly (another  <br/>
topic could be, 'what is the average life of a box?') and 2) Why is it  <br/>
exactly that many of these boxes actually get wet at all?  I mean,  <br/>
personally if I'm letterboxing and it's raining, I don't even touch the  <br/>
inside stuff until I'm safe under a shelter -- or at least my umbrella  <br/>
-- and have dried my hands off.  Yes, I'm sure accidents happen and the  <br/>
box could fall... but how often does that really happen?<br/>

&gt; Count us in the pigment crowd for all of W's reasons.  We recently<br/>
&gt; had to replace a soaked logbook.  Dye Ran.  Pigment Stayed.<br/>

All the dang time... As amazing as it seems, I have learned that few plastic boxes <br/>
are actually watertight. They leak with appalling frequency. That's why every one of <br/>
my logbooks has two (count 'em, TWO) baggies around it and I often add an extra <br/>
bag to logbooks I find.. I've decided the real function of the box is to protect the <br/>
plastic bags from damage. In addition, animals chew the boxes, they crack in cold <br/>
weather and folks sometimes fail to seal them correctly. <br/>
<br/>
I feel the same as Warrior Woman regarding pigment ink: love it! I, too, have had <br/>
logs from my boxes get wet. Those blank pages where a dye image used to be are <br/>
most disappointing. Plus, just try to color a large stamp on a hot, windy desert <br/>
afternoon with dye based inks. The stuff dries way too fast for that situation. It's a <br/>
study in frustration to even try. Funhog<br/>

Choose your hiding spot wisely. Boxes that get messed up fast are those that are hidden <br/>
in unfavorable locations. Something to do when considering a spot: if you were a <br/>
chipmunk, would you hide there to get out of the rain? Conversely, if you were an <br/>
amphibian, would you go swimming there after the rain?<br/>
<br/>
These things get wet because they're outside. The thing to avoid is placing your <br/>
letterboxes where water will collect (or rise up and snatch the box away!).<br/>
<br/>
The box you use can make all the difference in the world, too. Some people swear by the <br/>
Milan Classics containers available at Linens'n'Things. I swear by the blue-rimmed <br/>
Rubbermaid containers. And genuine Ziploc freezer bags (without the zipper handle).<br/>
<br/>
The lifespan of a box depends on its hiding spot (which involves many more variables than <br/>
just water), the container, internal protective measures, and how well it is RE-hidden by <br/>
Finders. And luck. Some boxes are born unlucky and some have nine lives.<br/>

&gt; quickly<br/>
<br/>
Depends what you mean by "messed up" and "quickly". <br/>
In general, I suspect the average life span of a<br/>
letterbox is less than three years, but it varies from<br/>
one afternoon to as long as LbNA has been online.<br/>
<br/>
Having FOUND a great many letterboxes and geocaches<br/>
gives one some idea what holds up long-term and what<br/>
doesn't:<br/>
<br/>
Baggies on the OUTSIDE of the container are almost<br/>
totally worthless; the best you can hope for is that<br/>
they'll keep some of the dirt off the box so the<br/>
finder doesn't get his hands as dirty opening it up --<br/>
but he probably won't put the ripped-up baggie back on<br/>
when he's done, so all you've done is made litter.<br/>
<br/>
Genuine military-style ammo boxes hold up well and<br/>
protect everything inside an order of magnitude better<br/>
than anything else.  Unfortunately, they also bring in<br/>
the occasional terrified phone call to the bomb squad.<br/>
<br/>
Plastic food containers are all over the map, but<br/>
easily the best are the relatively new "Lock-N-Lock"<br/>
brand.  Simply superb.  Genuine Tupperware is easily<br/>
the worst, throw that stuff away.  I find Glad<br/>
containers work OK, not great.<br/>
<br/>
Various large-mouth screw-top plastic jars such as<br/>
mayonnaise jars, peanut butter jars, cashew nut jars,<br/>
pretzel jars, trail mix jars, etc., are really good,<br/>
and cost nothing.  The biggest problem is if the<br/>
opening is big enough for your log book.  I usually<br/>
paint these jars with camo paint.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever container is used, put anything that might<br/>
suffer if it gets wet inside a baggie INSIDE the<br/>
container.  Provide a separate baggie for the log<br/>
book.  Make sure the baggie is plenty large so that<br/>
the finder doesn't have to tug to get the log book in<br/>
and out of it -- it won't last.  And, above all,<br/>
never, NEVER put the pen INSIDE the baggie with the<br/>
log book!  There's no need to protect the pen from<br/>
water damage, and it just punches holes in the baggie<br/>
if it's inside it.<br/>
<br/>
Carry lots of spare baggies to help maintain<br/>
letterboxes that you find.  It's far better to simply<br/>
install a new baggie than to write the owner a note<br/>
saying a new baggie is needed.<br/>
<br/>
I collect short pens.  I've found several nice types,<br/>
but if you can't find any you can make some: just take<br/>
a stick pen and cut about an inch off the tail end. <br/>
This makes them fit in letterboxes much better.<br/>
<br/>
After all this, letterboxes will still take hits.  If<br/>
you use the wrong rubber to make your stamp, it'll rot<br/>
and fall apart.  I found a superb custom stamp that<br/>
somebody had paid a commercial shop some big bucks to<br/>
make for him from a digital image, and it had<br/>
completely melted into a blob in a letterbox that got<br/>
sunlight on it.  The pink stuff (Speedy-Stamp) is much<br/>
better, seems to hold up well.<br/>
<br/>
Properly mounted on a layer of foam and a layer of<br/>
wood, a good rubberstamp seems to be more durable than<br/>
everything around it.  Often the log book is a<br/>
complete disaster, but the rubberstamp is fine.<br/>
<br/>
I've had some letterboxes chewed by dogs.  They just<br/>
love to find such things, and I made the mistake of<br/>
hiding a letterbox in a park where people often walk<br/>
their dogs.  The plastic container ended up all full<br/>
of tooth holes, while the rubberstamp inside was still<br/>
OK.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2) Why is it  <br/>
&gt; exactly that many of these boxes actually get wet at<br/>
&gt; all?  I mean,  <br/>
&gt; personally if I'm letterboxing and it's raining, I<br/>
&gt; don't even touch the  <br/>
&gt; inside stuff until I'm safe under a shelter -- or at<br/>
&gt; least my umbrella  <br/>
&gt; -- and have dried my hands off.<br/>
<br/>
Easier said than done.  When you've just hiked four<br/>
miles and it JUST started raining five minutes ago and<br/>
it's now coming down in buckets and you won't ever be<br/>
coming this way again, it's hard to convince yourself<br/>
to just put the letterbox back without opening it.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, though, I'm pretty sure I've never<br/>
gotten any significant water inside anybody's<br/>
letterbox.  More often is the problem that the<br/>
container leaks, so it gets wet inside every time it<br/>
rains while it's sitting in its hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
