The Bevin Lake Safety Rest Area is in the perfect location for a <br/>
break when I go over White Pass.  Now that I am in the habit of <br/>
looking for letterbox sites, I happend to find one.  Although named <br/>
for Bevin Lake, the lake can not be seen anywhere around.  The lake <br/>
is probably somewhere across the hignway up Bevin Lake Road.<br/>
To The Trailhead: As you drive along US 12, look for mile marker <br/>
126.  You can't miss it, it is right across from the Bevin Lake <br/>
Safety Rest Area!<br/>
To The Letterbox: After you safely rest, look to the west to the Pet <br/>
Area.  You will note that the entire area is fenced.  At the far side <br/>
of the Pet Area, you will see the fence comes to a point, with a <br/>
grove of trees in the corner.  Inside the grove of trees there is a <br/>
stump, under which your prize is hiding.   <br/>
