BTW, speaking of semiotics.If you haven't already, check out the novel,<br/>
"Just a Couple of Days" by Tony Vigorito.an interesting book about the<br/>
complete loss of language and symbols.<br/>

Subject: Re: [LbNA] Would you like to help me bury Limited Edition T-Shirts?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Maybe HIDE is a better word?<br/>
<br/>
"Plant" seems to have been the jargon settled upon, at<br/>
least in my small, perhaps out of touch view of this<br/>
world and its linguistic evolution.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Geez, we can go over these definitions forever.<br/>
<br/>
We could. Or, we could spend more time discussing the<br/>
discussion of the idea than the idea. Whether or not the<br/>
fact that we are doing so speaks to either the quality of<br/>
the idea or the quality of the discussers is left to the<br/>
role of the reader.<br/>
<br/>
I'll admit that I am personally always taken aback by the<br/>
suggestion that this idea or that idea is not "letterboxing",<br/>
keeping in mind that the original letterbox didn't even<br/>
contain stamps, much less the boundaries some people like to<br/>
draw around hand-carved, bespoke, or otherwise. Me, I hate<br/>
boundaries, but that's just me. Why is Jan 12th, 2008, the<br/>
right date to bound the game on this line? Perhaps Jan 12th,<br/>
1860 should have been the day to bound it that it shall<br/>
contain nothing but a logbook :-) (That would have helped<br/>
people like me who don't really care all that much about<br/>
stamp art or creating it, yet still want to find a way to<br/>
enjoy this sort of activity anyway).<br/>
<br/>
The meme market will mercilessly kill lame ideas on its<br/>
own -- no need to arbitrarily draw boundaries; doing so makes<br/>
one come off as narrow-minded, self-important, and parochial,<br/>
at least to me, and being snooty or nasty in the process only<br/>
makes it look even sillier. JMHO, of course. How's that for<br/>
not being PC? (One thing I hope we all can agree on is that<br/>
we need less PC BS and more frank discourse; Human linguistics<br/>
makes being PC impossible anyway (both the literature<br/>
and the archive of mapsurferspeak will demonstrate from a<br/>
linguistics point of view why this is so -- at least if one<br/>
accepts the general gist of the arguments from the "East Pole"<br/>
school of thought, or, perhaps, even not, but they are so<br/>
compelling, how can you not?)).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I try to avoid terms like "letterboxing" and<br/>
"letterboxes" just for these reasons -- modern "letterboxers"<br/>
have bounded them with so much baggage and boundaries. Avoid<br/>
those terms, and you can do what you want, and no one will<br/>
get in your face about it. That's my experience, anyway. Call<br/>
them "shirtboxes", and people will leave you alone for sure,<br/>
since it seems clear that negative, non-constructive answers<br/>
are not desired; yet sometimes, in some peoples' minds,<br/>
negative, non-constructive answers are warranted (but, IMHO<br/>
these generally play better off-list). I mean, I think it<br/>
is ok to say -- "I really don't like the idea, and don't really<br/>
have any suggestions, sorry.". Most people, however, tend to<br/>
keep to themselves when they have such opinions, or find a<br/>
nice or subtle way to convey them.<br/>
<br/>
And furthermore, I would avoid the term "bury", because it<br/>
ain't PC :-) despite the fact that there seems scant<br/>
difference between moving rocks around and moving dirt around,<br/>
and 99% of the environmental damage done is placing<br/>
non-biodegradable trash in the environment, regardless of how<br/>
it is concealed. Of course, the arguments for bury, which<br/>
you never hear, are that it is less prone to becoming visible<br/>
trash, and less likely to result in visibly destructive<br/>
"hack searches". But I will not even hint a pro-bury platform<br/>
here, as doing so will generate more flames than walking into<br/>
a dungeon full of red dragons, and lord knows, the list don't<br/>
need that, does it?<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, it wouldn't be a mapsurferspeak post without<br/>
mentioning the word semiotics.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>
