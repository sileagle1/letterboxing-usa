Let 'er Buck stamp.  I was the first one to find it yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I picked the worst possible time to seek it out as <br/>
kids were breaking for lunch and that is their local smoke spot.  So <br/>
for over a half hour I sat on a rock across the way and wrote all <br/>
over my clues as if I were writing a letter.  I was determined to <br/>
stay there until they lift.  One of the kids finally came over to <br/>
ask what in the world I was doing.  =-)  I guess they were going to <br/>
be up to even more no good had I left.  I persevered (barely) and <br/>
got it once they left.  Of course I was dodging finding and hiding <br/>
it from when passerbys came.  Well worth the wait. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!!!  Again great stamp.<br/>
