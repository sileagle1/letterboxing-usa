<br/>
I just found out that a letterboxing short story I wrote is finally available. It was<br/>
chosen as part of a mystery anthology based on the Chesapeake area. Only about seven<br/>
pages, but it's all based on letterboxing. Part of Chesapeake Crimes III. <br/>
<br/>
https://wildsideboo ks.3dcartstores. com//Sisters- in-Crime_ c_674.html<br/>
<br/>
There's the link to it on the publishers site and it will be available on Amazon in about<br/>
two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
SHOULD you buy it and should you like ANY of the stories, please post a positive review<br/>
on Amazon when possible. Those things really do help. The authors get no profits from<br/>
the book as they all go the the Sisters in Crime chapter, but the more notice it gets the<br/>
better for all of us in getting more chances to be published again. <br/>

I only had to glance at the list of stories to know which is<br/>
your's.... Inked to Death!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Sadly I am not a mystery lover (historical fiction  - NOT the romance<br/>
kind! - is what I devour) so I wouldn't want to pay the $14 just to<br/>
read one story.  But I hope it does sell well.<br/>
