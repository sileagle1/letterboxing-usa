Man! Next time I will make sure to leave a gold one.<br/>
Hey, forks make great digging tools, and weapons to fight off those<br/>
nasty bugs (like a sister). Plus someone left an expired Kinko card. Now <br/>
what can you do with that? Mom did say that we would go back and<br/>
add to the box since it lacked the cool kids items. Just another<br/>
reason to hike that steep hill again.<br/>
<br/>
To Trey- I am gifted! Plus my sister helped me write the messages and<br/>
she corrects my spelling. My Aunt,pyscomommy2003, keeps telling my<br/>
Mom that I will be bored in kindergarten. I hope that I don't have to<br/>
glue beans on the alphabets again. Had to do that in preK , so I<br/>
became a preK drop out.<br/>
<br/>
To Jerry P.- Thanks for the info. Now I just have to convince Mom and<br/>
Dad to drive across the U.S. I know, I will promise not to say "Are<br/>
we there yet". That really gets them mad.<br/>

</p><p>I'm so glad to see other kids on here--I'm rnrB and I'm 3.  My brother trkr (8 mos) is just starting to walk.  We found our first LBs the other day in the beautiful Pacific Northwest (Mom told me to say that)--but no cool toys inside.  We'll keep looking, though--maybe we'll add some of our own little toys from McDs!  Mom says we're going to go looking for a whole bunch more soon.  C-U on the trail!
</p><p>Gotta run,
</p><p>rnrB (and don't forget me!!!  trkr)
