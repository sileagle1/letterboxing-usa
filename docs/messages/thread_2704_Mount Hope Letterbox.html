<br/>
Hunt this box at your own risk.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:      Easy<br/>
Terrain:        Easy with several short climbs<br/>
Time:       1 hour<br/>
<br/>
Directions<br/>
<br/>
Route 80 exit 35.  There are small road signs directing you to the park that <br/>
is on the north side of Route 80. <br/>
<br/>
Mount Hope Historical Park was once booming iron mining and processing site.  <br/>
Mining operations reportedly started in this area as early as 1710, and it <br/>
was mined up until 1958, almost 250 years.  Three separate veins of ore were <br/>
mined on the property, known as the Brennan, Mount Pleasant, and Richard <br/>
veins.  The veins run in a southwesterly to northeasterly direction.  There <br/>
are dozens of mine subsidence pits here, as well as abandoned railroad tracks <br/>
used by mule drawn trams, ruins of several old buildings and long forgotten <br/>
electrical poles.    <br/>
<br/>
Important Note<br/>
<br/>
Before setting out for this letterbox always keep in mind that you must <br/>
remain on the marked trails.  It is very important to stick to the marked <br/>
trails, as there are mine shafts and subsidence pits here! Some of the <br/>
unmarked trails lead up to the Picatinny Arsenal, which is strictly off <br/>
limits.  You will have no problem as long as you stick to the marked trails. <br/>
<br/>
Obtain a trail map at parking lot if available.<br/>
Sign points to trails, follow trail for a bit then take the red trail.<br/>
When red trail splits, take right fork.<br/>
Eventually you'll come to the orange loop trail, take right fork.<br/>
Eventually orange trail will begin to descend, continue to follow trail.<br/>
Eventually you'll come to a small tree on the right of the trail with an <br/>
orange blaze on it, directly behind the small tree is a huge tree.  The huge <br/>
tree has a blaze on it used if you were coming in the opposite direction.  <br/>
