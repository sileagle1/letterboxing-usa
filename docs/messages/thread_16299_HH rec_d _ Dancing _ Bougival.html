home to find that "Dancing at Bougival" had arrived via post.<br/>
It is a beautiful little carving with an equally attractive logbook. <br/>
Renior is my favorite Impressionist painter, so the little container <br/>
it is in, brightened my day. <br/>
   I hate to put such a lovely HH in any box around here for various <br/>
reasons. The boxes here have either been trashed, gone missing, or <br/>
mildewed quickly. This lovely dancing couple should be handled with <br/>
care. <br/>
   Thanks Mark in GA for sending me this lovely little treasure <br/>
created by Chuck Nail and dedicated to his bride.<br/>
