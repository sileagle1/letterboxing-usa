<b>Please hold all orders for those two items....Yes, I can still accept logo Patch orders.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry,  Mohmers</b><br/>

=========================================================<br/>
Town Hall has asked that their name be taken off the LbNA website immediately.  They are not willing to deal with us as a group anymore.  <br/>
Andrea was very nice and polite and even apologetic on the phone ... this was her boss's decision.  I was thankful that it has nothing to do with me personally but still it is embarrassing.<br/>
I fully understand why they made their decision ... read below<br/>
<br/>
I have a new distributor for the Logo Patches so that is not a big deal BUT the TownHall name has to be removed from the web page on the logo and merit badge and clear bumper sticker forms.<br/>
<br/>
sorry for the problems.<br/>

       The reason TownHall made this decision is because of one letterboxer (who I should name but won't).  She does not receive email.  She called them several times a week for the 4 to 6 weeks that her large patch order took and was very rude.  She sent a 100+ LbNA logo patch order directly to them.   <br/>
       Although Town Hall was very nice to me on the phone today and even apologetic about having to make this decision, they said that this woman was the last straw (there had been another letterboxer who harassed them last year).  She berated them and kept them on the phone forever, something they could not afford.  I<br/>
        understand their decision since she caught me on the phone more than once and yelled at me for some time also.  She is sure that I and TownHall have conspired to steal her "postage stamps" and her money and have conspired to take too long in getting these patches back to her ... she wrote a letter to the BBB which was forwarded to Town Hall and will remain on their recorded for ~5 years.    <br/>
       I'm a little irritated since I had to front the cost of the set up fee on the merit badges and finding someone else to do them at this cost will take a little bit of time.  <br/>
       Town Hall wants to have their name and address removed from the website ASAP.<br/>
