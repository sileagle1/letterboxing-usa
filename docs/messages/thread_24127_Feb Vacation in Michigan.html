Hi there!<br/>
<br/>
There's a great box, right near Northville called "Here's Looking For <br/>
You, Kid".  Great stamp and clues, really cool looking trees in there, too.<br/>
<br/>
There's another one starting right in downtown Northville that was <br/>
fun, too, called Go Team, Hoop Roll.  Somewhat cryptic clues, pretty <br/>
fun.  You may need to have someone with you familiar with Northville <br/>
to get to the right place.  I'm not sure.<br/>
<br/>
There's also three or four others in Maybury Park in Northville.  I <br/>
haven't found those boxes yet, so I can't really say if they're good or not.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to travel a little ways, I'd suggest the "wandering in <br/>
the wetlands" series in West Bloomfield (fairly long hike, 3 box <br/>
series), the "Go to Hell" one in Hell, MI has great clues, really <br/>
short easy walk, but lots of fun. Also the "Time Waits for No Man" <br/>
box (Mystery box in Macomb county) is awesome, great clues, great <br/>
stamp!  I highly recommend that one, but it's probably 45 minutes to <br/>
an hour from Northville.  Another series that's a little far away, <br/>
but awesome is the "Intrigue at Aiden Lair" series in Somerset <br/>
Center, probably an hour or so from Northville also (unfortunately in <br/>
the opposite direction!), but well worth the trip.  It's in the most <br/>
bizarre park I've ever seen. Very cool place, and supposedly <br/>
haunted.  "Mo' Mustangs" in Dexter is fantastic, too.  It's a set of <br/>
7 different boxes that you need to find to assemble one really cool <br/>
stamped image.  That's probably about 1/2 hour away and well worth the trip.<br/>
<br/>
There are several fun boxes in Livonia, that are pretty close to <br/>
Northville.  Also, if you like Drivebys, check out Ars<br/>
Gratia Artis in Redford, really quick and easy, but one of the most <br/>
bizarre places I've ever seen.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, I should mention a couple of my own boxes "Sandy <br/>
Crane" in Jackson and "the Nomadic Gnome - winter home" in <br/>
Waterford.  They are both a little bit away from Northville (about an <br/>
hour to Jackson, 45 minutes to Waterford, again opposite <br/>
directions)  But, *I think they're worth the trip!<br/>
<br/>
Ohh, I just thought of another one! It's a mystery box called The Sun <br/>
Shines.  This was my first box found and it is a lot of fun.  The <br/>
clues are all pictures.  I think you'd really need someone who knows <br/>
the area, though, to find the starting spot.<br/>
<br/>
When are you coming to MI?  Just be prepared!  It's freaking COLD <br/>
here right now.  A lot of these boxes I mentioned are longish <br/>
hikes.  You'll need to dress warm!!<br/>
