                    <div class="plaintext-content">    I am calling this box the "Phoenix Tree" box because it is hidden <br/>
inside a tree that rose from it's own ashes(so to speak). Years ago, <br/>
this tree fell over, pulling some of it's roots out of the ground. <br/>
The trunk broke off about four feet above the roots. But, the lowest <br/>
limb remained and grew nearly straight up to form an almost normal <br/>
tree. The original trunk lies at an angle of 70 degrees from vertical <br/>
and is hollow. The open end is between the exposed roots. The trunk's <br/>
diameter is one foot. <br/>
     This box is located in Brainard Forest, which is on the West <br/>
side of the MDC reservoirs on the North side of Farmington Avenue, <br/>
West Hartford, CT. <br/>
     From the main parking area, make your way to the South end of <br/>
reservoir #3, which is about 1/4 mile to the North-West. From there, <br/>
go west on the paved road and turn right at the corner going North. <br/>
Continue the 250 yards to the dead end where there are two large <br/>
cylindrical gas storage tanks. To the North-East of those tanks, <br/>
there are tall cliffs. There are two gaps in the cliff face through <br/>
which you can climb to the top. Be sure to use the gap that is <br/>
farther West. The direction of the gap from the South-Easternmost <br/>
tank is 44 degrees (magnetic). As you approach the top of the gap, <br/>
stay along the East wall and climb the narrow, 4 foot high step. <br/>
Above the step, the slope begins to level off. Proceed at 40 degrees <br/>
a distance of about 50 feet to a small cliff. the Phoenix Tree is <br/>
about 9 feet from the South-East side of that cliff. Good luck.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the letterbox!  I'm assuming that's WCOC as in <br/>
orienteering.  My daughter and I enjoyed the Reservoir area so much <br/>
while we were at the orienteering event on Sunday that we were <br/>
wishing for a letterbox there!  We were even considering possibly <br/>
planting on ourselves, but that would be in the very distant future.  <br/>
If we do, I suppose having 2 there wouldn't be bad.  Thanks again for <br/>
planting the letterbox. <br/>
   Another great weekend for being outside - we saw 2 deer at the <br/>
reservoir - not just a glimpse, but ahead of us for 5 minutes or so!  <br/>
Hope everyone else was able to enjoy the weather!!<br/>
