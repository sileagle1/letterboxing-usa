this survey. It reaffirmed for me why some of my boxes have gone <br/>
missing, and I learned a few things as well. Thank you, Rick..for <br/>
taking the time to make this survey.<br/>
<br/>
One caveat I would like to include...make sure when you are planting <br/>
boxes further off trail that you don't create a "spur" trail...that is, <br/>
a new permanent trail made by heavy traffic. Pick a direction that <br/>
hides traffic better, such as over rocks or pine needles...not moss or <br/>
other low growing plants.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
