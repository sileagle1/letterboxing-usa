If you are going to go letterboxing you might want to carry a little<br/>
pack with a stamp pad,pen,paper,your signature stamp,and a couple of<br/>
baggies in case the box you find might need a little TLC.....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many letterboxes have an inkpad but I think the majority do not. It's somewhat of a regional thing but overall it's best if you carry ink with you. A set of 24 Marvvy Brush Markers are wonderful. The ink stays wet longer than other watercolors so you have time to ink up a stamp with one or more colors before stamping your journal.<br/>

  Okay, everything I read about letterboxing mentions the container, the<br/>
  stamp, and the notebook. But no one says if there is an inkpad in the<br/>
  box, or do we carry that with us? Angela<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some boxes do contain ink pads. But don't take chances the ink pad could be dried out or <br/>
frozen or wet. Always be prepared. You could also go the marker route as many of us do. <br/>
That way you can make the image multi-colored. <br/>
