campus was hopping with alumni in town for Reunion Weekend, so we had lots <br/>
of company at The Plantations.<br/>
<br/>
We dragged along friends who live adjacent to the grounds and were able to <br/>
surprise them with a path they'd never walked before. Beautiful little walk <br/>
with great clues.<br/>
