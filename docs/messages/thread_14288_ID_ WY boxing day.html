<br/>
First, I checked on the first box I ever planted "Swan Valley."  I'm sad to<br/>
say that it was MIA.  I am so sad about this.  That box and the spot it was<br/>
in are extra special to me.  I don't know if any letterboxers ever found it.<br/>
I will recarve it and place a new box somewhere near the spot.<br/>
<br/>
next, I checked out "Plant One for Me" that Don and Gwen planted.  I was so<br/>
tickled to have one planted in my area.  It also appeared to be called<br/>
"Rainey Creek Squirrel." It was a fun carving.  Thanks so much Don and Gwen!<br/>
<br/>
After a fun cookout with friends, I went just across the state line and<br/>
checked on my "Elk Reserve."  It was alive and well and had a few stamps in<br/>
it.  It was the first time I had seen other LBers stamping into one of my<br/>
books-a hazard of enjoying this hobby alone (although that will change, I<br/>
have faith!  I'm building it; they will come).<br/>
