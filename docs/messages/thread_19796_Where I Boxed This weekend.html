                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had such big plans for boxing yesterday.  Went to Bucks County to move my college son from his summer dorm to his new dorm (he hurt his back last month and we didn't want him to do any heavy lifting himself).  Actually we had planned almost the same boxes as "highlysung" and thought maybe we'd meet.  Well, the move took much longer than we expected and our plans went out the window.  We ended up doing the 2 boxes in the Mercer Hunt in Doylestown which we found without much trouble.  We had followed "Big Mac" in the search and may have actually caught a glimpse of him when we started out (if he rode a bicycle).  There was a wedding reception going on at Fonthill.  Actually it was our anniversary yesterday but since we had no time to celebrate, we'll celebrate today instead.<br/>
