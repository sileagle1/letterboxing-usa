Near Yellow Springs, Greene County Ohio<br/>
Difficulty 3 - 2.5 miles round trip<br/>
Hybrid Geocache/Letterbox<br/>

The east wind was playing on my cheek and every forest sound was <br/>
hushed in the grove of tall pines.  Footfalls quieted by inches of <br/>
pine needles lay as a carpet on the forest floor.  Standing in the <br/>
center of the glade I wondered where to hide the box.<br/>
<br/>
The quest begins at a small parking lot nearly a mile from the <br/>
pines.  Just north of Yellow Springs take 343 where it begins at US <br/>
68.  Shortly after the right turn is a turn off for parking at the <br/>
reserve given by her father in honor of Helen.  Take the gravel road <br/>
all the way back to the parking lot, potholes and all.  GPS backup <br/>
gives N 39 48.244 W 83 52.939 at the trailhead.  <br/>
<br/>
Take the trail to the east, down a hill and over the bridge at the <br/>
falls.  This November afternoon, the falls could be heard for more <br/>
than 100 yards, but in the summer they make little more than a cool <br/>
mist in the rocky gorge.  <br/>
