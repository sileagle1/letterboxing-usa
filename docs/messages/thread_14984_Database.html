How about new entries for boxes with 'issues' and a simple edit to <br/>

there is much confusion about what various terms mean, e.g. MIA or <br/>

No surprises here.<br/>
<br/>
If the meaning of entries can't be trusted, then what is the point? <br/>
This seems less a case of "growing pains" and more of shortcomings <br/>
inherent in diluting the subjective and personal nature of each <br/>
person's letterboxing experience into a couple of words and assuming <br/>
that all readers will interpret them the way the writer intended.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, quite a few people are posting that they do not want <br/>
their boxes mentioned at all. How will database users now or in the <br/>
future know who those people are? Another database for non-<br/>
participants in the data-base? <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, based on comments made so far, it is not too much to ask one <br/>
of the moderators to put up a poll so the list members can voice <br/>
their preference to keep the database or not,perhaps a simple Yes or <br/>
No, and then abide by the will of the people on the list. Once the <br/>
poll is closed, if the database goes, it goes (at least on the LbNA <br/>
talk list), and if it stays, those who are invested in it will use it <br/>
and those who are not,won't, much the same place that we are in right <br/>
now. <br/>

If the database stays, the only issue that remains is how to respect <br/>

It seems the best (only?) way is to amend your clues to reflect your <br/>
wishes.  It took me no time at all to do this for my one measly box, but <br/>
could mean quite a bit of work for others.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ms Alafair,<br/>
With all due respect to you who has been a benefactor to the Nail <br/>
Family, I would like to express my opinion on the matter of a <br/>
database.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, if a box placer does not want his/her boxes to be <br/>
subject to sit-reps, database reports, spoilers and the like, then <br/>
that person should not make the clues public.  I believe that I have <br/>
a right to express my exprerience in a public forum and if the boxes <br/>
I have found have been made available to me by a public forum then I <br/>
have every right to report on them as I experience them, whether <br/>
found or not, whether I am correct in assuming missing or not. I <br/>
have the respect to not report a box as absolutely missing and I <br/>
also have the wisdom to not spoil a location, especially a mystery <br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>
If I, as a box creator and placer, do not want my creations subject <br/>
to such reports I can limit who has access to the clues. This will <br/>
limit the number of people who will find the boxes but it will also <br/>
give me some control over that aspect.  It also adds to the mystique <br/>
of the sport in some cases.  <br/>
<br/>
This is the risk in having boxes available to the general public: <br/>
public knowledge-public access.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for your interesting and thoughtful response to the on-<br/>
going debate with respect to the database and your caveat as this <br/>
pertains to public access to information. I think you've presented a <br/>
new perspective we haven't heard or considered before. <br/>
<br/>
If I understand you correctly, you are saying that a person who <br/>
publishes letterbox clues, for example, to a public forum intended <br/>
for the dessemination (the LbNA site) and public discussion (the <br/>
Yahoo List-Serve)of letterboxes and letterboxing gives up their right <br/>
to restrict or forbid comment by their very publication of those <br/>
clues on such a public forum. Any person who belongs to the list-<br/>
serve (since there is no two-way communication function within the <br/>
LbNA site) may publicly comment on any matter discussed, clue <br/>
published or any other submission to that forum. Further then, the <br/>
only way to restrict or prevent any person who wishes to restrict <br/>
discussion of their clues in particular is to not publish them in <br/>
such a public forum. <br/>
<br/>
The essence of this seems to border on something quasi-legal that I <br/>
feel I am not qualified to debate. I gladly defer to others to pick <br/>
up this thread who are more savvy in this area than I. <br/>
<br/>
I do agree with you that while choosing to not publish ones clues may <br/>
limit the number of finders, it also ensures somewhat more control <br/>
over opportunities for public comment.<br/>
<br/>
Hope your boys are still having fun finding that stamp.<br/>

database and would hate for reports of damaged or missing boxes to go there<br/>
where I may not see them. I can see merit in posting a status report to the<br/>
database ONLY if attempts to contact the owner have been futile.<br/>
<br/>
I've also been disheartened by some of the messages in the database that<br/>
reveal the contents of the boxes, such as describing the image or that the<br/>
book is hand-bound or that there are interesting artifacts in the area. For<br/>
me, the delicious "surprise" at the end is meaningful and important and to<br/>
have some inkling of what lies in wait diminishes the experience. I could just<br/>
not look in the database, but then I would have trouble checking for any<br/>
reports on my boxes...<br/>

For me, I'm willing to take the risk of being disappointed and frustrated to<br/>
then be able to revel in the victory of finally finding a dastardly box.<br/>
