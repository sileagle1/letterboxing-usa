Dear Heavens--Think the best of people!  ~Maybe~ the writer is doing something she loves to do...writing about something interesting.  Lord knows letterboxing is the most interesting thing I've stumbled upon in a long while--by the by...the person who told me knew about it from the Smithsonian article from years ago.  I'm sure that writer was paid too...(isn't that how writers make their living?)<br/>
<br/>
And ~maybe~ people like me and mine, respond to interested writers, because no matter how long we've been doing it...we've grown to love the sport and it's brought our family closer together.  Maybe others who learn about it will too grow to love it.  Am I missing something? Is it supposed to be a clandestine endeavor?<br/>
<br/>
I found the tone of your missive curmudgeonly and a maybe bit elitist.  Yes we're new, but opinions no less valid...we're here to stay...and happy to spread the word.  I would have responded to the writer had I been doing this for ten years, instead of 2 months.  It's a lovely sport and I would think, made better by happier people being involved.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;It's a complicated subject but certainly voicing one's<br/>
&gt;&gt;opinion is NOT taking away someone else's freedom of<br/>
&gt;&gt;speech.<br/>
<br/>
Amen!<br/>
<br/>
Breath deeply...let's go stamping!<br/>

wrongly. The point isn't about the money at all- it's bigger than <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's wonderful when someone has found something that they <br/>
love and they want to share it by writing an article about it. Of <br/>
course they should be paid for their work if that's what they want.  <br/>
Those are the people whose opinions I will more likely trust.  How <br/>
they see what they are writing about is infinitely better, more <br/>
intimate and more real than a person who has no feeling on the <br/>
subject whatsoever. To them it's just an interest story that might <br/>
sell. <br/>
<br/>
 We've had people on this list who have written and published <br/>
articles about their experiences with letterboxing- they are sharing <br/>
their love of the hobby.  I found the Attache article very nicely <br/>
done and have admitted that I found out about it in a magazine <br/>
article written by a letterboxer. <br/>
However, I do not get the impression from the one I referenced that <br/>
they had ever found a box on their own.  That worries me- what slant <br/>
will this article take?  How can someone who doesn't understand, has <br/>
never experienced, has never found a box do this hobby justice and <br/>
help not hurt it?<br/>
<br/>
We have lately had a rash of boxes being removed by 'officials', <br/>
being searched out and vandalized by those who don't have an <br/>
understanding of the essence of letterboxing. Makes me think back to <br/>
Trish's Dolphins at Daybreak story/box. ;o)  I can't help worry that <br/>
more exposure will make it harder to enjoy this hobby. That is a very <br/>
valid worry!<br/>
<br/>
These are my concerns--not that someone has made some money on it. <br/>
I'm surprised that that was the point you thought I was making.<br/>
 I really would like to know how those who have had this hobby for <br/>
years more than you or I feel about this issue.  If it weren't for <br/>
them we wouldn't be here, afterall. <br/>

The travel magazines (Ohio, Attache') would not do that; the papers might...<br/>

The "Harper's Ferry" box I placed a few years ago doesn't even mention<br/>
"Harper's Ferry".  In fact, you have to solve the thing to realise it is<br/>
even near NPS land (and in all honesty, I didn't realise it was on NPS land<br/>
at the time -- in those days, there was no controversy anyway).  IIRC, it<br/>
it literally 3 meters from non-NPS land, as I went out of my way to keep it<br/>
off the other land in question (it was about 2 meters or so off the AT, <br/>
seemed safe to me at the time ...)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, someone is taking alot of time to figure these out.  At least <br/>
someone is having fun :-).  Can you say 5 star mystery box ;-)<br/>
