I foolishly thought that by tucking the porgy letterbox into a crack and<br/>
covering it with stones it would be okay in a high surf.  Wrong.<br/>
Yesterday's Nor'easter apparently washed it away.  The small stones meant to<br/>
cover it were there, but the box was gone.  There must have been enough<br/>
water to lift the buoyant box out of the rocks.  If it remained airtight,<br/>
it's probably off the Cape somewhere right now.<br/>
<br/>
Webmaster, please change "Porgy and Bass" to just "Bass", and the box count<br/>
to one.  Thanks.<br/>
