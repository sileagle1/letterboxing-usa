be busy for the rest of the day.  So of corse I ran out to do a little more <br/>
letterboxing work!<br/>
<br/>
Im happy to report Mischiefs Mystery box is alive and well and has even <br/>
received a few visitors.  Also, the Langley box is doing well, with a few <br/>
visitors of its own.  It even was found by a wayward geocacher who left a <br/>
nice note, and cute drawing to serve as his stamp.<br/>
<br/>
(Hmmm could there be a hint or two in there?  Naaaaa.)<br/>
<br/>
I still have a great deal of Letterboxing Wanderlust pent up, despite my day <br/>
today... I checked/visited 7 letterboxes.  With any luck, Ill get out next <br/>
weekend too!<br/>
