I have tracked down the clue site again and am now able to sail after this one!  I have the PoC info....but I could not find the orignal page put out with the clues on it from Cherokee.   I had run across it at work....but then did not save a link to look at it later, I printed off the clues, but when I tried to find the site again, I could not.  I set sail to plunder this very night!  Thanks again all!  <br/>

Anyone that wants to talk Pirates with me I greatly enjoy the emails!<br/>
