                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently the www.letterboxing.org website has changed. I don't know if<br/>
you were aware of it or not. During the change, many lboxes became<br/>
abandoned because the original people who placed them never registered<br/>
with the new site to "claim" their lbox. Georgia has 3 abandoned boxes<br/>
and I'm checking up on these boxes to see if they still exist, if they<br/>
want to be attributed to the original placer (which means that placer<br/>
has to register with the site), and if they don't want the box anymore<br/>
if they would consider letting me adopt it. <br/>
<br/>
Please check with the webmasters if you are registered. If not, please<br/>
register or let me know if the box is missing or open for adoption.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mark<br/>
