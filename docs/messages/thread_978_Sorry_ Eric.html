Sorry, Eric, but on top of mystery clues, that was just too tempting. <br/>
You'll have to be 7th to visit, if Dan and Melissa aren't already <br/>
half-way up the trail! What better way to invite trouble than to drag <br/>
my 4 kids out in 90 degree/90 percent weather on an iffy treasure <br/>
hunt with huge thunderboomers threatening? Fortunately, the red caps <br/>
were at the suggested bearings and the thermocline was marvelously <br/>
refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
Stan and Angus (and Murray?), that was a terrific job! I do have to <br/>
mention, though, that as a born and bred San Franciscan, "Bear Cave" <br/>
has ***other*** furry cultural connotations that add a pleasantly <br/>
edgy mystery to your already intriguing clues (if you're not "in," <br/>
just try a Yahoo search on bear cave and see what hits). Wonderful <br/>
great fun puzzling excellent clues, though! And I loved your terrific <br/>
hand-cut stamp! Do you mind if I email it to Tom to insert into the <br/>
online clue page?<br/>

Looks like the Ram has beat us again.  We ran out to the Glacial Park box<br/>
tonight, as soon as we saw it posted, but somehow the Ram found it a week<br/>
before us :(<br/>
Unfortunately we will probably have the find the Bear Cave after the Ram as<br/>
well.  Work is busy this time of year and we will be heading north to find<br/>
some of the New Hampshire boxes this weekend.  Can't wait to find the<br/>
Monadnock Box and the others nearby!!<br/>
Looking forward to your next boxes<br/>
