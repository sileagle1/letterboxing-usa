5 Boxes in Nehantic State Forest, East Lyme, CT<br/>
New London County<br/>
Easyvery family friendly hike.<br/>
10-20 minute hike one way (quick adult pace) -- without stopping <br/>
for boxes<br/>
Planted by Kristen and Sean 9-7-02<br/>
<br/>
To Nehantic State Forest:<br/>
Off of either Route 95 or 395 take Route 85 North.<br/>
Follow 85 North to Grassy Hill Road on Left (Chesterfield is on <br/>
Right.)<br/>
Take a Left onto Grassy Hill.  Follow for approximately 2 miles(?).  <br/>
Take a right onto Upper Walnut Hill Road.<br/>
Follow to the end of this road and take a left onto Holmes Road.  <br/>
Holmes Road goes straight into the Forest.  Shortly after <br/>
entering the forest you will see a 1/2 circle pull off on the left.  <br/>
There is room here for at least 4-5 cars.  This road continues <br/>
south through this section of the forest.  I highly recommend <br/>
turning around and leaving the same way you came.  The road is <br/>
a dirt road that is only large enough for 1 car to pass through.  <br/>
While there are a few places to pull off so other cars can pass <br/>
and it is a beautiful trip through the forest, it doesnt seem like <br/>
the best option for everyone.  If you do decide to continue down <br/>
the road, youll be ushered the correct way by a few closed gates.  <br/>
The road eventually connects to Grassy Hill Road (where youd <br/>
take a left to head back the way you came).<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the map for Nehantic State Forest that can be <br/>
found online through the State site is for the other section of the <br/>
forest.  This section is located in East Lyme.  Please note that <br/>
hunting IS allowed here.  As always wear appropriate clothing.<br/>
<br/>
There are several sections of the path that are covered with <br/>
stones which are intermingled with sections that are simply dirt.  <br/>
When I refer to the stony path I am referring to that particular <br/>
section of rock-covered path.  Hencethe end of the stony <br/>
path does not mean that the trail ends, simply that a section <br/>
covered with rocks ends.<br/>
<br/>
In each box you will find a baggie with an index card full of <br/>
information about that particular element.  Please take and keep <br/>
an index card from each box and perhaps you can take a guess <br/>
at which one you are after reading them all.  If there are only 2-3 <br/>
cards left, please e-mail me (fox412@aol.com) and I will <br/>
replenish!  In one or two boxes there may be more than one <br/>
card, please take one of each, they were meant to be kept for <br/>
future reference and study.<br/>
<br/>
After parking look across the street for the yellow gate and follow <br/>
the path behind it.<br/>
Shortly down the path you will see a fork.  Follow the path to the <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
Fire:<br/>
A stone wall on the left will end and the path is covered with <br/>
rocks.  From the end of the stone wall, walk 3/4 of the way to the <br/>
bend in the trail and look to your right for a long rock with a <br/>
smaller rock balanced on top.  Go behind the large rock and look <br/>
at its base under some small rocks for the Fire box.<br/>
<br/>
Earth:<br/>
Further down the trail you will see 2 large rock crops , one on <br/>
either side of the trail.  Just after passing these look to your right <br/>
for a cleared area that goes up a small hill. <br/>
This path should be found prior to leaving the stony path.<br/>
Go up to the top of this hill to the clearing.<br/>
Directly to the north is a stone wall.  Walk to the opening in the <br/>
wall and turn left.  On the far side of the wall from the clearing, <br/>
walk approximately 9 steps along the back of the wall.  If you turn <br/>
and face the wall, there should be a tree in front of you on the <br/>
other side of the wall.  In a nook of the wall here you will find the <br/>
Earth box.<br/>
<br/>
Metal:<br/>
Go back to the center of the clearing.  Directly to the East is <br/>
another hill heading up to a splinter shaped rock.  On the east <br/>
side of this rock you will find the Metal box.<br/>
<br/>
Head back down the hill(s) to the main trail and turn right to <br/>
continue<br/>
<br/>
Water:<br/>
Continue down the trail to another section of stony path.  It will <br/>
only be about 20-30 feet long.  Just ahead look for a 2-trunked <br/>
tree on the left.  On the North side of this tree look for the Water <br/>
box under a pile of rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Wood:<br/>
You will pass another small section of stony trail followed later <br/>
by a longer one.  At the end of this stony section the path will <br/>
become very narrow and you will notice a large open section.<br/>
There are two options for finding the last box.  If you cant find it, a <br/>
combination of these two clues should help:<br/>
1) Walk down the path until you are standing next to the solitary <br/>
tree.  At 270-280 degrees is the tree you are looking for.<br/>
2) Follow the path past the solitary tree until the trail JUST starts <br/>
to head uphill and then stop.  Turn around to face the trail and <br/>
look South-West.  There you should see a double-tree growing <br/>
out of one trunk.  <br/>
<br/>
Under the wood at the base of this tree you will find the Wood <br/>
box and also the clues to find the BONUS box.  The bonus box <br/>
isnt very far away from the Wood box.  Please copy the clues if <br/>
needed(extra blank cards are included) and then return the <br/>
original to the box as found so that everyone who gets there can <br/>
get to the bonus box.  Please only take 1 per person!!!<br/>
<br/>
Somehow you can get back to the trailhead if you continue on, <br/>
but without a map we didnt dare venture further.  This is a short, <br/>
yet beautiful, hike that is the perfect length for families and is very <br/>
flat (with the exception of the walk up and down a short hill for the <br/>
Earth and Metal boxes.) <br/>
<br/>
Please re-bag, seal the box tightly and re-hide as carefully as <br/>
possible!  <br/>
*Always leave things better than you find them.*<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the hunt and please let me know if you have problems or if <br/>
the boxes need some help!<br/>
