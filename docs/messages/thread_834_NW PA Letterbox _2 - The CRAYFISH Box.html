No compass is needed for this box.<br/>
All the boxes in this series are easy to find.<br/>
The boxes in this series are Pennsylvania Wildlife.<br/>
All stamps are hand-carved.<br/>
You can find them all in the Allegheny National Forest.<br/>
I have tried to get people to some scenic locations with these.<br/>
The boxes in this series so far.....<br/>
Crayfish<br/>
Spring Peeper<br/>
Turkey Vulture<br/>
Porcupine<br/>
<br/>
Box 2 - Crayfish<br/>
This is an easy box.... It is on the NORTH COUNTRY TRAIL<br/>
a bit up the trail from my first box.<br/>
<br/>
Directions....<br/>
Find these things and you will be successful:<br/>
The border between Warren and Forest County.<br/>
The devil's highway.... the route number is 666.<br/>
State Road 2001 (Minister Road).<br/>
Head North towards Cherry Grove.<br/>
The North Country Trail Crosses the road about two miles up.<br/>
Walk East on the trail.<br/>
About 100 yards into the woods, there is a short logging road<br/>
   which bears to the right while the trail bears left.<br/>
Bear left. <br/>
Follow the Blue triangles.<br/>
There is a big clearcut on your right.<br/>
Continue on the trail up the hill.<br/>
At the crest of the hill is a grove of scrub maple.<br/>
Right after that is a large pine grove on the left.<br/>
After a bit of pines there is a small field of prickly grass also <br/>
   on your left.<br/>
You are getting close.<br/>
About 20 feet off the trail beyond the grass is a spring which <br/>
   starts a stream.<br/>
Around the head of that stream are 8 iron pipes which have been<br/>
   pounded vertically into the ground.<br/>
There are two groups of twin pipes.<br/>
The short twins are your objective.<br/>
Look down to see a log covered with lichen.<br/>
Look beneath that log for the box.<br/>
Man! Are these directions easy, or what??<br/>
