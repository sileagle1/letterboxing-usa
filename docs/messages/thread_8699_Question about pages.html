<div>Hello all,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Question: I have posted clues to my first set of letterboxes, but I don't have a page set up for it. I remember one of the webmasters saying if you want a page on the letterboxing site to let them know.  What all is involved with this? I think a small blurb about our team would be great and much appreciated.</div>

<p>Location: Michigan</p>
<p>County: Lapeer</p>
<p>Difficulty: Terrain is hilly!!! WATCH FOR HORSES</p>
<p>Starting point: Ortonville Recreation Area (17 miles south of Flint, 9 miles north of I-75)</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Directions: Take M-15 North to Oakwood road then turn right. Follow Oakwood Road for several miles until you get to Hadley Road and turn left (North). Follow Hadley Road to Fox Lake Road; look for the horse camp signs. Turn left on to Fox Lake Road and take it until you reach Honert Road. At this point Fox Lake Road becomes a one-lane dirt road. Continue on the one-lane road to a parking spot designated by the clues.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>NOTE: Pets are welcome, but they should be on leash. This area is highly used by horseback riders, so please be aware! Also, be prepared to hike making sure to bring water, etc..</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Clues: </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>To start on the path one must first find the land where trees act as ladders. The angle of the moon, 320 degrees, makes it almost full, but sometimes the yellow color of earthly bound satellites can draw ones eye from the task at hand. Dont be distracted by such feeble endeavors, your prize awaits past the green sky above.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>In your quest you will encounter 3 wise men standing tall and brave against the flow. Pass them by, but heed their suggestion of 300 rubles does bring thou riches. Be steadfast in your determination through the ups and the downs, and when your path does make two, choose wisely and stay to the left of center. Be ever watchful of the insight of the fallen sentinel of the night, usually found standing tall and right. Again the choice will be this or that and at that spot follow the 180 course straight and true.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>If you are on your destiny this night, 3 old friends will show their might. It seems they have beat you here, oh but never fear for they are friend not foe and are placed to show you the way to go.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Ask the wisest of the three, oh which way should I carry me. His answer bold and true is to stand and face the light shining at 130 degrees this night. Once youre in line to see the spectacle that awaits, 20 heeltoe steps you must make. It is here you will end your quest, finding what you seek huddled in the safety of the meek.</p>

<div>No =) I understand the pages take time..... I 
didn't know if they needed to more information in order to make up a "page" with 
my team name.</div>

<div>We figure we are a team since there are 7 of

<p>Hi, If I understand you correctly you were wondering why your clues don't 
  appear in the clues section for MI. You already did all you have to do. I saw 
  your previous posting. It takes some time before the webmaster puts it in the 
  regular listing. It could be a day or a week. The webmaster can see by your 
  subject line that you have a new box. They will take it from there. Chuck and
