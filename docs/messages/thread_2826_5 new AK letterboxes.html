                    <html><body>Since I am sure youa re all hurriedly planning your Alaskan vacation, I 
<br/>wanted to make sure there were plenty of boxes to greet you upon arrival.  
<br/>Here are clues to the first 5.  :o)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Thunderbird Falls Box
<br/>
<br/>Head out the Glenn Hwy. to Thunderbird Falls/Eklutna exit. Once you get to 
<br/>the parking area of Thunderbird falls, just head up the trial. Remember this 
<br/>is a steep trail so be prepared.  Follow the trail until you cross a wooden 
<br/>railed fence.  At the top of the next hill you will see a birch with a 2 foot 
<br/>notch cut out.  Take a heading of 190 degrees and mark 15 paces to a lone 
<br/>birch with bottom moss and bear bread.  Take another reading of 230 degrees 
<br/>and take 6 paces.  The box is in the base of a small fallen birch tree. It is 
<br/>approximately 3/4 of a mile down the trail to the falls.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Spooky Cliff Box
<br/>
<br/>Eklutna is a small village just outside Anchorage where many "Spirit Houses" 
<br/>are displayed.  If you are searching for boxes in order, turn right when 
<br/>leaving Thunderbird Falls. Otherwise take the Eklutna exit off the Glenn Hwy. 
<br/>and follow the signs to Eklutna Lake.  On the right you will see a small turn 
<br/>off with a trail blocked by a concrete slab. From the left of the slab take a 
<br/>reading of 185 degrees At 12 paces you will see a beheaded tree. At 17 paces 
<br/>to a small trail goes the right of an arched birch. Soon you will come to a 
<br/>mound in the trail that resembles a grave.  The box is to the right under the 
<br/>first pine.  BE VERY CAREFUL HERE - THERE IS A SHEER DROP INTO A GORGE 
<br/>SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET BELOW. However, if you are brave enough to look over 
<br/>the edge you will see the remaining wreckage of a fatal collision.
<br/>
<br/>Finger Lake Box
<br/>
<br/>Take the Glenn Hwy. to Palmer.  Turn left at the first stop light in Palmer.  
<br/>You are now on the Palmer-Wasilla Hwy.  Go to Trunk Road and turn right.  
<br/>Follow this around to a 4 way stop and take a left.  The Finger Lake 
<br/>Campground is immediately on the left.
<br/>When you get to a fork in the road, take a right (away from registration 
<br/>hut).  Follow the dirt road through the camping areas to the lake. Park and 
<br/>follow the road around the bend to a trail on the right with several large 
<br/>stones at the entrance.  Stay on the trail and go almost to the end (the road 
<br/>will be visible through the trees). At the first small trail to the right 
<br/>take a heading of 150 degrees and walk 11 paces down the root steps which 
<br/>dead end into a tree. Take a reading of 90 degrees and walk 10 paces.  At a 
<br/>reading of 330 degrees there is a tree with a large root sawed off, the box 
<br/>is hidden well under this root.
<br/>
<br/>Double Trouble Box
<br/>
<br/>Drive out of Anchorage on the Seward Hwy. Once you pass Potters Marsh watch 
<br/>for a turn out on the left.  Popular moose sighting area, there may be a 
<br/>crowd.  Follow the road as it curves to the right. It will end at a parking 
<br/>lot.  Start at the display and head down the path. Stay on the path as it 
<br/>turns and you will find a restrictive sign in a string of large rocks. Turn 
<br/>right.  Watch for a double tree on your left.  At the tree take a heading of 
<br/>20, go approx. 30 paces.  You will know you are there because it is well 
<br/>marked.  Take a reading of 170 degrees, search behind the land mark.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Mini Waterfall Box
<br/>
<br/>Heading out the Seward highway enjoy the scenery until you get to McHugh 
<br/>Creek.  Then pay attention!  One mile past McHugh Creek on the left is a 
<br/>crescent shaped gravel turn out.  If you miss the turn out you can turn 
<br/>around at Beluga Point and go back 6/10 of a mile (gravel turnout will 
<br/>obviously be on your right now) You will see 2 wooden posts, standing between 
<br/>the posts take a heading of 210 degrees.  It is approximately 14 paces to the 
<br/>correct boulder, but it is very steep!  The box is level with the base of the 
<br/>tree to the left of the waterfall.  It's muddy so take time to wash your 
<br/>hands in the falls.  :o)</body></html>

<div>If I can find some time I sure would like to try 
Mini Waterfall Box.  My second Alaska tour starts this weekend and I'm just 
hoping I can squeeze in one try at your new letterboxes.  Can you estimate 
for me the time I need to be successful for the Mini Waterfall Box?  When 
you say "steep", is it like vertical?  Wish I had more time to 
call my own but my priority is to the group (want to keep my job).  But, 
maybe.
