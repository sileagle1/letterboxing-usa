                    <div class="plaintext-content">Use "pertis" - a nonsense backwards version of "Sitrep". I mean we <br/>
all can be a little backwards in life -- some folks find a series <br/>
backwards, some stamp upside down, and when you carve -- the image is <br/>
backwards to be forwards when you stamp in! This way we have a <br/>
keyword that everyone knows the meaning of and it doesn't have a <br/>
meaning!  Wait - isn't sitrep a nonsense word that we all know the <br/>
meaning of? Well, except for "newbies" ?  How bout just adding "What <br/>
is a sitrep" to the FAQ page on the website? Problem solved...<br/>
<br/>
I'm losin' it with all this humidity! LOL<br/>

There is not even anything that says you cannot continue to use the <br/>
word 'sitrep' if it works for you.  But, just an idea...  how <br/>
about '[STATE]: Boxing Update' or some wording to that effect, <br/>
something that is quite understandable what the post is about?    <br/>
<br/>
I think the point was that this term kind of came out of nowhere and <br/>
all of a sudden began appearing in the subject line of every other <br/>
message, before most people, including people who have been reading <br/>
this list regularly for quite some time, even had a clue what it <br/>
meant.<br/>
<br/>
I think the anti-sitrep campaign was in part the term, and in part <br/>
the posting of routine reports.  While we all find reports useful <br/>
when they provide information as to [possible] missing boxes or <br/>
interesting and funny experiences, I daresay I am not the only one <br/>
who really doesn't care to hear about every box found.  There are <br/>
hundreds of letterboxers on this list -- can you imagine what it <br/>
would be like if everyone posted a report of every box they found or <br/>
every time they went out boxing?<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, a lot of the more uneventful types of reports, would <br/>
more effectively be sent to the the person who placed the box, many <br/>
of whom don't read the list regularly, but would probably appreciate <br/>
an e-mail about their box.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents...  (not even claiming them to be particularly <br/>
educated pennies)<br/>
