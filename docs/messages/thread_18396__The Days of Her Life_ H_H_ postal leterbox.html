                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Martha pulled into the driveway yesterday afternoon, just in time to<br/>
help me with last minute Easter decorations! She cleverly wove my<br/>
dust bunnies into Easter bunnies. Martha groomed all the cats,<br/>
carefully saving the fur to knit into outfits for corporate world<br/>
Barbie and Ken dolls. Unfortunately, none of my cats shed the right<br/>
color fur (black and white) for prison apparel for the corporate<br/>
dolls..<br/>
  Martha drove to the local food co-op and picked up several dozen<br/>
organic free range chicken eggs to blow out, shellac and decorate,<br/>
using only the finest gold leaf paint, with cut up credit cards<br/>
pasted on as accents. When I asked her to help me clean up some dog<br/>
residue left in the yard by ill behaved neighboring pooches she got<br/>
a tad huffy, hurried off to a local hotel on the U-Conn Campus, with<br/>
plans to meet with our basketball champions' coaches to help redesign<br/>
the athletes' uniforms. One can only imagine what she has in mind.<br/>
  I'll be shipping, ah, not shipping..I'll be driving Martha via limo<br/>
to Bradlee Airport so she can go visit her next victim--I mean<br/>
Host!!.. very soon. I need to buy some ink pads so Martha's stamps<br/>
into my logbook match her intended colors.<br/>
