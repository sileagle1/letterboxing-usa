in town. It might be 'Poison Ivy' to you, but to us it's the <br/>

pictures of the stamp and us to the files section if your interested <br/>

&gt; "Poison Ivy" Letterbox<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bastrop, Texas  Bastrop County  North Texas Prairie Region<br/>
&gt;  Bastrop State Park<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Date of Placement:  3/21/03<br/>
&gt; Difficulty:  Easy<br/>
&gt; Total Distance to letterbox:  1.3 miles round trip<br/>
&gt; Placed by Baby Bear<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The "Poison Ivy" letterbox is located in Bastrop State Park. Formed <br/>
&gt; in 1938, the CCC did the initial development of the parks <br/>
buildings.  <br/>
&gt; The park also contains the "lost pines", an isolated grove of <br/>
&gt; loblolly pines separated from the main body in East Texas.  The <br/>
park <br/>
&gt; has camping, fishing, cabins, swimming, hiking trails and a golf <br/>
&gt; course.  This park connects with Buescher State Park via Park Road <br/>
1.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Directions:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From Bastrop, find Park Road one at the intersection of Hwy 21 and <br/>
&gt; Loop 150 (Hwy71).<br/>
&gt; The box is located on the Lost Pines Hiking Trail.  Pick up a map <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; you enter the park.  From the Headquarters, go east to the <br/>
&gt; intersection.  Turn right and follow loop road around to the hiking <br/>
&gt; trail start (symbol on map is a footprint, and noted in legend <br/>
&gt; as "Trailhead").  Park just past the trailhead in parking area on <br/>
&gt; left.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To The Letterbox:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow the trail for .6 miles to a trail junction sign.  From the <br/>
&gt; sign, go right 40 paces (you will see a rock outcropping to your <br/>
&gt; right).  Now go to your right (east) off the trail for 13 paces to <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; white stake.  From the "084" Orienteering white stake, go left <br/>
&gt; (Northeast) along the rock wall for 13 paces.  The box is just <br/>
below <br/>
&gt; the upper ledge (about 1 foot down) under leaves, with a reddish <br/>
rock <br/>
&gt; on top and next to a small broken off pine tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Plan to go back and get the other 3 soon.<br/>
