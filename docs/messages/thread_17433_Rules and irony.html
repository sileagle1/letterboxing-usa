I'm very sorry to hear that this happened and it definitely does sound like <br/>
an intentional bit of vandalism, and not the rational decision of an analytical <br/>
mind.  I doubt any but a very few would have any satisfaction from this and I <br/>
think that nearly everyone on the list would be sorry to hear that this <br/>
happened and sorry to see you discouraged by such a petty, destructive and somewhat <br/>
unhinged act.  <br/>
<br/>
All the boxes I've planted but one have been either destroyed or disappeared. <br/>
 I know when I put them out that this can, and probably will, happen <br/>
eventually.  I send my hitchhikers out and hope that I'll get to see them again.  If I <br/>
get one back and make it to claiming a full log book, I'm happy.  If not, I'm <br/>
ecstatic to get email from people who've seen them.  Your boxes are like any <br/>
other work of art and once they're out of your hands they're out of your <br/>
control, but I still like sending them out and intend to continue.<br/>

As a lurker and occasional poster here, I must also echo the <br/>
sentiments of the others in urging you not to give in to the <br/>
malicious losers that do this sort of thing. <br/>
<br/>
My family (wife, 2 young daughters) got in to this hobby/sport as a <br/>
means of getting out into the country, getting some exercise and most <br/>
importantly, doing things as a family - some things that we tend to <br/>
forget about in the hustle and bustle of our lives.<br/>
<br/>
We have witnessed first-hand the thrill of a "first find" in the <br/>
pristine wilderness of northern CA, and the revulsion at finding a <br/>
soiled diaper placed where a letterbox should have been. Still, we <br/>
continue to look and plant, because despite whatever anyone may try <br/>
to do, no one can take away our memories and the friends we've made <br/>
through this hobby. <br/>
<br/>
Don't give in!!!<br/>

people do unfortunately exist in our world.  Your loss of heart for <br/>
this fun hobby is painful.  I have not yet lost any of the boxes I <br/>

wanton destructiveness.<br/>
<br/>
Ron is right, if we close ourselves off from the fun aspects of <br/>
letterboxing because of the vileness of a few, we do the most damage <br/>
to ourselves.  I enjoy finding new places to visit, hiking and <br/>
observing nature along the way, and the thrill of finding a box in a <br/>
secret hiding place.  I have enjoyed these things before I found out <br/>
about letterboxing, and I will continue to enjoy them.  I am not <br/>
going to let a few vandals change what I enjoy.  They would allow <br/>
them to win.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything we can learn from the experiences of boxes that <br/>
have been distroyed?  Are there common locations or factors that we <br/>
can avoid when placing new boxes?  If we can learn what not to do, <br/>
we can make lemons into lemonade.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This is a great take-home question/lesson.  I keep thinking that if it<br/>
is the original placement of the box in question, then the best option<br/>
is to revisit the location and decide if it's too out in the open. If<br/>
a casual, non-letterboxer can obtain the clue and find the box then<br/>
it's doomed for destruction.<br/>
<br/>
If however the box is placed with complete discretion in mind so that<br/>
a casual find is not possible this eliminates the chance...but not<br/>
entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Once a person puts their clues out on the web, it's a free-for-all.<br/>
It's a meat market out there and your boxes are on the chopping block.<br/>
Who knows what malicious individual might tarket your boxes next? I'd<br/>
like to think that all of us are nice people - but time tells otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
So, you really have multiple factors working against you in this case.<br/>
If you've taken the route of publishing clues on the web, you have NO<br/>
control over the fate of your box - but if you have decided that you<br/>
want a certain audience and try like mad to keep undesireables out -<br/>
then you have a slight chance of protecting your treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad on the losses, not all is lost but all shall be remembered.<br/>

A shame, indeed.   It hurts not only the placer, but also anyone who might <br/>
have wanted to find those boxes down the line.   It's a pity some can't respect <br/>
the letterbox, if not the letterboxer.<br/>

to Mystery boxes. They last a bit longer. It's best to plant and send <br/>
clues to those you know who can be discreet. <br/>

There are many bad-hearted people out there.  There always will be.  We hope to think we will be safe from them here, and I hope to think we will often be.  But wemust never lose sight of the dangers, if not to our safety, then even to our deepest feelings.  Does that mean we quit?  Never.<br/>
<br/>
Think of the hurt we feel when we go through our first break-up.  Do we stop loving?  I hope never!<br/>
Think of the hurt we feel when someone whom we respect lets us down, or criticizes sharply.  Do we stop trying?  I hope never!<br/>
Think of the pain of losing a loved one.  Do we shut out the world?  I hope never!<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes in reality can be such silly things, but ew hold these bits of plastic and eraser dear, since they represent a fun community and a shared hobby.  We meet and share because it lightens our day and our world.  It's certainly entertained our family one way or another!<br/>
<br/>
Don't let the dark minds and the dark hearts of the world snuff that out.  If you stay true to the spirit of fun and challenge and shared (even if not with everyone) good times, then no amount of pathetic vandalism can stop us.  Remember the story of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas - he failed.<br/>

I work in the rubberstamping community and have enjoyed all the letterboxers I have met.  I have even taken step one in purchasing a really cool log book.  I am looking forward to letterboxing....I love scavenger hunts and seeing new places and have even thought of a few future homes for yet to be born letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't let the bad people of the world get to you.  If they are so small of mind and heart then that is their fate...but I would like to think that the replies I have seen on here are indictitive of the true nature of letterboxes!<br/>

Looking forward to the Letterboxing Experience...<br/>

  I have to agree.  The 'Support Our Troops' thread here also reminded me:<br/>
  There are many bad-hearted people out there.  There always will be.  We hope to think we will be safe from them here, and I hope to think we will often be.  But wemust never lose sight of the dangers, if not to our safety, then even to our deepest feelings.  Does that mean we quit?  Never.<br/>
<br/>
  Think of the hurt we feel when we go through our first break-up.  Do we stop loving?  I hope never!<br/>
  Think of the hurt we feel when someone whom we respect lets us down, or criticizes sharply.  Do we stop trying?  I hope never!<br/>
  Think of the pain of losing a loved one.  Do we shut out the world?  I hope never!<br/>
<br/>
  Letterboxes in reality can be such silly things, but ew hold these bits of plastic and eraser dear, since they represent a fun community and a shared hobby.  We meet and share because it lightens our day and our world.  It's certainly entertained our family one way or another!<br/>
<br/>
  Don't let the dark minds and the dark hearts of the world snuff that out.  If you stay true to the spirit of fun and challenge and shared (even if not with everyone) good times, then no amount of pathetic vandalism can stop us.  Remember the story of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas - he failed.<br/>

    I second Peppermint Patti's thoughts and I'm sure others do too. It must <br/>
    have been a sad day for you and your daughter. I know the cost was high <br/>
    but please don't stop playing the game. Because if you do, it means <br/>
    they've won, and that would truly be a pity.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Chaos et al, I have been away from my computer (I only have <br/>
access at work) so I just saw your post. Indeed I am sorry that you <br/>
have been hurt by what are clearly senseless acts. I hope that you <br/>
are just wondering aloud about the person who may have vandalized <br/>
your boxes because I assure you that I did not commit, and would not <br/>
consider such an act. I don't know if you saw my philosophical <br/>
ramblings a while back but I would hope that it would be clear from <br/>
that post that I wouldn't do anything like what has happened to you. <br/>
<br/>
I posted your warning with out mentioning the source because I <br/>
didn't want to drag you into it and engage you directly in a public <br/>
forum. What I wanted was an objective response about what the <br/>
warning meant. The very fact that you wrote the warning indicates <br/>
that you have a specific bias. I don't deny you the right to have a <br/>
viewpoint; I just wished to hear an independent opinion. What I <br/>
heard in the warning is your contention that "the game" was intended <br/>
to be played a specific way. This implies rules and that runs <br/>
counter to what I understand about letterboxing. "The Game" seems to <br/>
have evolved without rules and with out any central authority with <br/>
many variations from the origional Dartmoor "boxes" springing up and <br/>
even some splinter groups that play only amongst themselves. People <br/>
share the concept with each other and then it grows and evolves and <br/>
changes as everyone interprets it in their own way. I suppose <br/>
Geocaching would be the most extreme example of how the game has <br/>
varied from its origional form. Change is inevitable and your post <br/>
implied a change that I hadn't heard of but I wished to know if this <br/>
was a commonly accepted change, this, it seems to me, could only <br/>
come from a wide group of independent observers.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your pain and hope you don't give up on the hobby if <br/>
you were enjoying it. I am relatively new to it and don't have a lot <br/>
of experience to draw on but placing boxes seems to be an art in <br/>
itself. I have never planned a boxing day and found all the boxes, <br/>
infact, it seems darn close to a 50% missing rate. <br/>
<br/>
Whether you are the victim of calculated vandalism or random <br/>
mischief, the perpetrators have offended societies rules of common <br/>
decency. We are of one mind on that point. A friend of mine who <br/>
introduced me to boxing told me that the only rule is that there are <br/>
no rules and that's part of the intriguing aspect of the hobby for <br/>
me. Everyone does their own thing and everyone has fun. <br/>
Unfortunately we, and our boxes are exposed to all the ravages that <br/>
society and Mother Nature can muster, but I don't want to go getting <br/>
philosophical again...<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we could get together sometime and work on some replacement <br/>
boxes for your vandalized boxes. Maybe if we each got some of our <br/>
friends together and we met we could get your boxes replaced and <br/>
exchange some ideas from our respective viewpoints.<br/>
