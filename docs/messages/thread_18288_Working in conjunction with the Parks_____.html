<br/>
     How does one balance safety (i.e., not placing personal info in a letterbox for fear of some mentally deranged <br/>
person discovering and and using that info for various nefarious plans) and prudence (i.e., hiding a box like object <br/>
in a public place where someone might discover it and the next thing you know, you've got S.W.A.T and the bomb squad <br/>
lining up!)?<br/>
<br/>
     Given that something as innocuous as a package of candy triggered this very thing in Athens, see this URL: <br/>
http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/100203/opi_20031002057.shtml , what's to stop the same thing from happening in a <br/>
park?  Now, granted, a state or municipal park is not as ripe a 'target' as, say, City Hall or other governmental <br/>
buildings, but it can happen, reference this URL: <br/>
http://www.americanforests.org/productsandpubs/magazine/archives/2003summer/recreation.php which was in the middle of <br/>
nowhere. Now, given it WAS an old ammunition container and all, but I've seen how some people react to things unknown.<br/>
<br/>
     Where's the balance?  Placing your contact info on the box is no different that using the contact the placer <br/>
function at the LbNA website, as an e-mail address can be traced as well as an IP address. Hiding on the Internet is <br/>
not an easy thing to do anymore.<br/>
<br/>
    I'm not trying to tell anyone to 'Stuff a Sock in it', nor am I trying to stir up the pot. I'm simply asking when <br/>
is to much information, to much information?  BookCrossing.com uses a BCID number to identify each book.  No one <br/>
places anything more than their first name, if even that, on a book they release....  However, I doubt many of them <br/>
are releasing books into the wild, in the wild!  We're kinda stuck in a different realm here.  I, myself, place my <br/>
full contact information in my letterboxes. Name, address, e-mail address.  I include the 'standard' this is a <br/>
letterbox info sheet from the files section here. I try to make people's ability to locate the owner of the box as <br/>
easy as possible.<br/>
<br/>
    I think that the contact the placer function at the LbNA website is a wonderful way to get information to the <br/>
placer, but it does lead to the Webmasters e-Mail box getting flooded with replies to those letter because people <br/>
didn't take the time to cull the address from the letter, they just hit reply.<br/>
<br/>
     I'm not saying anyone is right, wrong or indifferent, just curious.<br/>
