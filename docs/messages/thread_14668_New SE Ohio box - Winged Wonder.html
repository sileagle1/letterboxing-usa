This is a microbox so please bring a stamp pad (box does not have <br/>
one) and pencil.  The box is located in the Lake Alma State Park <br/>
outside Wellston, Ohio.  To get there, take S.R.#93 north from <br/>
Wellston and turn onto S.R. #349 just outside of town.  S.R. #349 <br/>
will lead you a couple of miles out past the water plant and across <br/>
the dam that forms Lake Alma.  (You'd never guess that 100 years ago <br/>
the island had an amusement park and interurban trains brought people <br/>
from Columbus and elsewhere to relax here!)  After you cross the dam, <br/>
the park loop road turns off to the right past the park office and <br/>
the swimming beach.  Make your way to the Old Pine Nature Trail which <br/>
is across the road from the second swimming beach.  A few paces into <br/>
the trail you will reach a water bar (a treated 4x4 placed across the <br/>
trail to divert water.)  Count about 25 paces (1 pace = 2 footfalls) <br/>
up the trail from this water bar  (trail is steep and pace count is <br/>
approximate) until you reach a very large tree on your left which <br/>
arches over the trail.  On the uphill side of this tree where it <br/>
snuggles against an old fence you'll find our little winged wonder.  <br/>
Please email us at bigguy9210@yahoo.com if you find it and tell us <br/>
how it's doing.<br/>
