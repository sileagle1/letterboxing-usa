is indeed nice to hear from Randy on this big list. We know he's <br/>
generally very busy, so any time he takes a few to write, its very <br/>
welcome! <br/>
<br/>
For the new boxers out there, do you history and check out the orignal <br/>
posts from 6(ish) years ago on this list. You'll learn a lot from folks <br/>
like Randy, Jay, Mitch, and Susan (not to mention develop the respect <br/>
for them that they deserve!). <br/>

Boy, I guess we need to come up with a trail name or something. Maybe <br/>
Steve &amp; Heidi (et al) would work : ) <br/>
