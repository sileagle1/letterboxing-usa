  Took the three neighbor kids letterboxing while my kids were in art class <br/>
at the Forest Park Art Museum  on 7/26/01.<br/>
  They chose to hunt for my son's Turtle Park box and to our surprise the box <br/>
had a visitor from Virginia just the day before! <br/>
  This box has had only a few visitors ... 4 or 5 ... and is in a very rural <br/>
area so low traffic is good. :o)<br/>
  We wondered if the Virginians were making a letterboxing trek across the <br/>
nation or just visiting the area for a while?<br/>

HI Amanda,  Maybe we will run into you on the trail or in one of the parks!<br/>
The micro boxes were all there on the last count.  4 of the boxes are film <br/>
canisters which  hold only a stamp to "stamp in" with but  ROAR! is bigger <br/>
and does contain a very small log book.  To log in you'll need to get online.<br/>
