                    <html><body><p>Wanda and Pete,  Congrats on the new boxes.  I am flattered that you would use the name that I coined for the race I created on that trail nine years ago.  If anyone runs and is looking for something different to try the Westerly Track and Athletic Club hold The Lil Rhody Runaround race on the trail the Sunday before Thanksgiving.  (You would probably have to wait until your cool-down to box).  It is part of the New England Trail Runners series and attracts premier trail runners from throughout New England and beyond.  I started the race, under the aegis of the WTAC, for my husband and his friend who like to run trail races and met there to train.  I directed the race for the first four years until we moved to Hawaii.  I then passed the reins over to my septuagenarian mother-in-law who ably organized it for another five.</p>
<p>I don't suppose that one of the LBs would be in the vicinity of where you two ran the water stop every year?</p>

Yes, there is indeed a letterbox called "Water Stop" to mark our volunteer efforts of providing water to the thirsty racers for the Westerly Track and Athletic Club's annual "Lil' Rhody Runaround" trail race.  It is not on the road where we had the water stop, but further along the trail where there is less of a chance of vandalism.  We did not use our earlier ideas of "Catwalk" and "Sitting Tree" boxes, but chose something easier for us to carve.   You'll have to do the series to find out what we chose, but I will say we did go with the idea of supplying ink pads with colors selected to form a rainbow if you stack the stamps in order.<br/>
<br/>
And, unlike it implies in the clues intro, it's REALLY HARD to get lost on this well marked trail and there isn't really that much mud!  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you all enjoy the boxes,<br/>
<br/>
