Careful, you may be casting aspersions upon an innocent.<br/>
It would be best to assume the best of the inquiring party.<br/>
I think one can sign up to list but not activate their free yahoo e-<br/>

I do hope that is the case...<br/>
<br/>
If so, I do apologize.<br/>

I fear I am an incorrigible cynic, and the bounced message just smacked of <br/>
those familiar antics.<br/>

Moose Hill (got laid off in May due to statewide budget cuts -- Thank you George <br/>
Bush!!). That would not stop us, however, as I still help them out and <br/>
volunteer for events, and I'm sure they would allow it. <br/>
<br/>
I will look into possible dates and let folks know.<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't work out, I may be able to arrange something at my new <br/>
job...I now work for the Trustees of Reservations as the Assistant to the Regional <br/>
Director to Southeastern Mass. There has GOT to be a good spot somewhere....<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned!<br/>

p.s. has there been any development regarding a date for the Peace on Earth <br/>
Gathering in Westboro, MA?<br/>
