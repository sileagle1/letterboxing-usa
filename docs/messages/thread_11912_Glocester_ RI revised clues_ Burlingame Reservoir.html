been removed. We saw it at another stream crossing, probably moved <br/>
there by people who wanted to get 4-wheel ATVs across. The old bridge <br/>
was kind of scary to cross anyway, so we are changing the clues a <br/>
little bit to make the approach to the letterbox safer and easier, if <br/>
less exciting. Driving and parking directions are the same as before.<br/>
<br/>
New Clues:<br/>
Walk down the dirt road past a hemlock grove on the left. In time you <br/>
will start ascending a small hill. You will notice the old confields <br/>
on the right. Listen for the sound of the waterfall on your left. The <br/>
only telephone pole that has spikes used for climbing protruding out <br/>
of either side is your first stopping place. At 210 degrees you will <br/>
spot an old maple tree with one large dead limb. Walk to the tree, <br/>
and then take several steps to the left and forward to the part of <br/>
the stream at the top of the waterfall. Look across the stream here <br/>
and spot the stone wall whose southwest corner contains the <br/>
letterbox. Remember what things look like from this side of the <br/>
stream and imagine how it would look from the other side.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the dirt road, turn left, and continue up the road to the <br/>
next intersection. Turn left and cross one span of a paired I-beam <br/>
bridge, which provides good footing. Take a quick left to follow the <br/>
stream back to the waterfall, the stone wall, and the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to see the old Burlingame Reservoir itself, get back on <br/>
the main dirt road and go left at the next fork.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Too funny, Latte Man and Curious Crane!  I just got this email!  I wonder if you were out there checking on your box on the 13th when we were there. Did you read my reply to Mary Manatees report? My boyfriend, his cousin, and his friend were off exploring and making a lot of noise while I was trying to retrace our steps to find the right spot for Laurel. I was walking around looking verrrry closely at telephone poles when 2 people passed.  Did you see me there?<br/>
<br/>
When Betz and I went last year, we never found a wooden footbridge.  We crossed over on a very slippery and crumbly-barked fallen tree.  I thought that was your "bridge to nowhere."  I know we weren't the only ones to not find the bridge.  Nice box, though; pretty area and nice stamp.  I hope it gets more visitors now.<br/>
