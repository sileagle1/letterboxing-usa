"Welcome to the Great Letterboxing Contest!" read the sign at the <br/>
crowded picnic pavilion. Everyone was buzzing with excitement, <br/>
meeting and greeting folks and personas that they had only read about <br/>
online. Exclamations of "Oh, YOU'RE so-and-so?!" and "It's so good to <br/>
finally meet you!" and "I just LOVE your signature stamp! How do <br/>
you...." dominated the conversations. The morning gathering had the <br/>
look feel of a family reunion except no one resembled anyone else.  <br/>
All shapes, sizes, color, religion, sexual orientation, political <br/>
affiliation, social class and degrees of bathing habits were equally <br/>
represented and enjoying themselves.<br/>
<br/>
One bearded man, in a brown leather hat, camouflage pants and hiking <br/>
boots kept looking at his watch as he listened patiently and only <br/>
slightly disinterested to a thin New England couple explain about <br/>
carving techniques with an Exacto knife. It's true these New <br/>
Englanders could carve a mean stamp, but Rhus' mind was on the day's <br/>
event. He glanced once more at his watch then interrupted the lecture <br/>
with a smile and pat on the arm, "Sorry team, it's time to start this <br/>
thing. He stepped away and said smiling "We'll chat later okay?" then <br/>
climbed to the top of the picnic table.<br/>
<br/>
Rhus raised his hands and said loudly "Alright! It's....." looking at <br/>
his watch again "...now exactly two minutes to start!" He paused as <br/>
most of the people quieted down. Three women along the edge of the <br/>
group continued talking animatedly and giggling uncontrollably. <br/>
<br/>
When they noticed the quieted crowd, one of the women said "Shh! Shh! <br/>
It's starting!" The giggles turned to snorts, then louder giggles <br/>
then they covered their mouths and tried to put on innocent faces. <br/>
Just a couple more snorts and they were settled enough for Rhus to <br/>
continue.<br/>
<br/>
"Welcome to the Great Letterboxing Contest!" Rhus began as the <br/>
letterboxers all turned in his direction. "We will be starting in <br/>
just over a minute!"  With that announcement a number of folks, still <br/>
listening, began mentally checking their gear or patting their <br/>
pockets to make sure they had remembered everything they needed.  <br/>
Backpacks, fanniepacks, ink pads, watercolor markers, compasses, <br/>
clues, maps, stools, etc. A couple people made a quiet "Doh!" and <br/>
made a dash to their cars.<br/>
<br/>
"Before you are released, let me just remind you of the rules for <br/>
letterboxing, 'THERE ARE NO RULES' " Many smiled and nodded agreement <br/>
as some began to edge closer to their planned starting points with a <br/>
calculated nonchalance.<br/>
<br/>
Rhus reached down to lift and hold aloft a very nice looking wood, <br/>
marble and metal trophy. Two columns rose up on the side that were <br/>
topped with gold forms of hikers that looked to be struggling and <br/>
climbing toward the middle pedestal. The middle pedestal was marble. <br/>
Rising higher than the columns, it was topped with a larger gold form <br/>
of a Tupperware container.  The bottom of the pedestal had an <br/>
engraved, brass plaque which read "#1 Letterboxer" with the date and <br/>
the year below. It looked very nice, even in spite of the tarnishing <br/>
fingerprints of all the boxers who'd admired it covetously this <br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
 "We will meet back here at the appointed hour, where and when we <br/>
will present this trophy to the winner of the Great Letterboxing <br/>
Contest!" A happy cheer went up with some applause and pats on backs <br/>
and slightly insincere well-wishing among the letterboxers. <br/>
<br/>
"Are you ready?" Rhus asked, feeding the excitement. The gathering <br/>
tensed.  Rhus looked at his watch and put a quieting finger in the <br/>
air, "GO!" he shouted, throwing down his hand, and like cockroaches <br/>
in a surprise flick of the light switch, the letterboxers scurried <br/>
off in all the different directions at once, some got themselves <br/>
quickly to their car, others ran through the field. Some paused mid-<br/>
step to examine their compass, shuffle in a circle then head off in a <br/>
daze.  Still, it wasn't half a minute before the entire area was <br/>
empty except for Rhus.<br/>
<br/>
"I thought they'd never leave" Rhus said to himself as he sat down on <br/>
the top of the table and fished a cigarette and Zippo out of his <br/>
pocket. He took another look at his watch then settled in for the <br/>
wait.<br/>
<br/>
At the appointed hour it looked like everyone had returned with <br/>
smiles on their faces and only a couple people limping but looking <br/>
triumphant. <br/>
<br/>
"What a great idea," Rhus thought, "With everyone having such a good <br/>
time, I hope they do this every year."<br/>
<br/>
"Welcome back!" Rhus grinned from his perch on the table. "I see you <br/>
all returned to the finish line on time and glad to see everyone's <br/>
none the worse for wear after a full day of letterboxing. Now, let's <br/>
see who gets the prize! Who won?"<br/>
<br/>
In startling unison, all but one of the letterboxers proudly <br/>
exclaimed "I did!" Then eyes narrowed as each looked at the others. <br/>
Mumbles began, "No, I did." "I'm the winner." "You didn't win!" The <br/>
mumbles turned into shouts. "You're an idiot!" "Shut up!" "I won!" <br/>
<br/>
The one quiet letterboxer still sat at a table during the ruckus and <br/>
looked around expectantly.<br/>
<br/>
"Wait a minute!" Rhus shouted, climbing to the top of the picnic <br/>
table, "There's some confusion here! If you would all calm down, we <br/>
can sort this out. <br/>
<br/>
By a quiet show of hands, who claims to have won?" All hands shot <br/>
skyward except for the lone boxer's at the table.<br/>
<br/>
"Okay, then, one at a time starting with you in the hunting vest," <br/>
Rhus facilitated, "how did you win?" <br/>
<br/>
The woman, fetching in the bright orange, spoke up, "Well, Rhus, as <br/>
you know, there are over 22 miles of trails in this park!  In fact, <br/>
there's 22.4 miles to be exact." she said smugly. "I hiked every last <br/>
inch of those trails getting all the  boxes in this park in one <br/>
visit. No one can claim to have hiked further today." Some nods of <br/>
amazed agreement sprinkled the group.<br/>
<br/>
"Now hold on!" cried a woman from the back. "Excuse me," she said, <br/>
snaking through the crowd to the front and stepping up on the seat of <br/>
the picnic table. "I happen to know that there are only 10 boxes <br/>
hidden in this park! Clearly I am the winner because I have found 24 <br/>
boxes today. 10 of the 12 in this park, 8 in the park down the road <br/>
and 4 individual boxes along the way."<br/>
<br/>
Responding to the puzzled looks of some of the boxers, Rhus quickly <br/>
did the math. "But that adds up to 22 boxes."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh," she said, "and 2 hitchhikers."<br/>
<br/>
"Hitchhikers don't count!" A couple by the trophy yelled <br/>
simultaneously. "They have to be 'pure' letterboxes to count!" said <br/>
the wife. "That's absolutely right," supported the husband as the <br/>
wife inched protectively toward the trophy. "Pure letterboxes are the <br/>
only things that count. One clue, one stamp, one log, one box equals <br/>
one F.  Hitchhikers don't have boxes or clues of their own so they <br/>
don't count.<br/>
<br/>
"No, no, no." Said an elderly woman seated in the midst.  The crowd <br/>
parted a bit and turned to the center. "The most important thing <br/>
about this event" she continued "are the people here. I made it a <br/>
point to meet and exchange with every person who attended here today. <br/>
Certainly no one else here can say that, so I am the winner."<br/>
<br/>
An uproarious guffaw was loosed from one of the three women who'd <br/>
reclaimed their spot at the edge. This, of course, caused the other <br/>
two women to burst into laughter themselves and clutch their chest <br/>
and side with giggles as they tried to catch their breath. <br/>
<br/>
"Oh come on!" the first of them panted between fits. <br/>
"We had SO much fun today!" squealed the second. <br/>
"We WIN!" shouted the third and they started an impromptu and awkward <br/>
square dance which ended in a pile of three bodies rolling in the <br/>
grass gasping for air with contented sighs.<br/>
<br/>
But that display didn't lighten the mood. It just caused the other <br/>
letterboxers to scowl and assert their claim to the title, #1 <br/>
Letterboxer. "I found the most!" "So what? I hiked longer!" "Pure <br/>
letterboxes!" "No it's PFX! PFX! PFX!" "I got back first!" "I was <br/>
first finder!" "We found the hard ones!" "Follow the SHOE!" "It's <br/>
exchanges, really, that matter." "Fun! Fun! FUN! -<br/>
snort!" "Hitchhikers DO SO count!"<br/>
<br/>
Realizing the group would not settle themselves, Rhus picked up the <br/>
trophy and hefted it like a bat, contemplating. He took a couple <br/>
short, aiming swings at the pavilion's support post, readied his <br/>
stance, stepped into the pitch and swung. Arcing full force toward <br/>
the support beam, the gold tupperware box created a whistling as it <br/>
passed above the heads of the malcontents, drawing their eyes to the <br/>
impending destruction of the coveted prize.<br/>
<br/>
A collective gasp. A small scream. Then silence.  Complete silence.  <br/>
No sound beyond the natural sounds of the secluded park could be <br/>
heard. Every eye was on Rhus. Or, more specifically, every eye was on <br/>
the trophy.  Mouths were frozen in mid sentence.  Hands clutched at <br/>
pearls or covered the eyes. No one spoke, no one moved, no one <br/>
breathed.<br/>
<br/>
But the destruction didn't come.  With a calculated effort, Rhus had <br/>
stopped the swing just slightly before the trophy could hit the <br/>
wood.  <br/>
<br/>
Then Lady Prisspott fainted.<br/>
<br/>
The second of silence stretched to a seeming eternity.  Then, <br/>
breaking the silence was heard "Excuse me." from the boxer who sat <br/>
alone. Heads turned, many noticing the quiet man for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
"Hi, I'm Poison Ivy" he said amicably "and, uh, I thought there would <br/>
be beer."<br/>

Thanks, Poison Ivy, for putting some laughter and perspective<br/>
back into the discussion.  I'm so glad I took the time to<br/>
read through your whole post!  I very much enjoy your brand<br/>
of sanity (or insanity as the case may be).<br/>

  "Welcome to the Great Letterboxing Contest!" read the sign at the <br/>
  crowded picnic pavilion. Everyone was buzzing with excitement, <br/>
  meeting and greeting folks and personas that they had only read about <br/>
  online. Exclamations of "Oh, YOU'RE so-and-so?!" and "It's so good to <br/>
  finally meet you!" and "I just LOVE your signature stamp! How do <br/>
  you...." dominated the conversations. The morning gathering had the <br/>

  All shapes, sizes, color, religion, sexual orientation, political <br/>

  point to meet and exchange with every person who attended here today. <br/>
  Certainly no one else here can say that, so I am the winner."<br/>
<br/>
  An uproarious guffaw was loosed from one of the three women who'd <br/>
  reclaimed their spot at the edge. This, of course, caused the other <br/>
  two women to burst into laughter themselves and clutch their chest <br/>
  and side with giggles as they tried to catch their breath. <br/>
<br/>
  "Oh come on!" the first of them panted between fits. <br/>
  "We had SO much fun today!" squealed the second. <br/>
  "We WIN!" shouted the third and they started an impromptu and awkward <br/>
  square dance which ended in a pile of three bodies rolling in the <br/>
  grass gasping for air with contented sighs.<br/>
<br/>
  But that display didn't lighten the mood. It just caused the other <br/>
  letterboxers to scowl and assert their claim to the title, #1 <br/>
  Letterboxer. "I found the most!" "So what? I hiked longer!" "Pure <br/>
  letterboxes!" "No it's PFX! PFX! PFX!" "I got back first!" "I was <br/>
  first finder!" "We found the hard ones!" "Follow the SHOE!" "It's <br/>
  exchanges, really, that matter." "Fun! Fun! FUN! -<br/>
  snort!" "Hitchhikers DO SO count!"<br/>
<br/>
  Realizing the group would not settle themselves, Rhus picked up the <br/>
  trophy and hefted it like a bat, contemplating. He took a couple <br/>
  short, aiming swings at the pavilion's support post, readied his <br/>
  stance, stepped into the pitch and swung. Arcing full force toward <br/>
  the support beam, the gold tupperware box created a whistling as it <br/>
  passed above the heads of the malcontents, drawing their eyes to the <br/>
  impending destruction of the coveted prize.<br/>
<br/>
  A collective gasp. A small scream. Then silence.  Complete silence.  <br/>
  No sound beyond the natural sounds of the secluded park could be <br/>
  heard. Every eye was on Rhus. Or, more specifically, every eye was on <br/>
  the trophy.  Mouths were frozen in mid sentence.  Hands clutched at <br/>
  pearls or covered the eyes. No one spoke, no one moved, no one <br/>
  breathed.<br/>
<br/>
  But the destruction didn't come.  With a calculated effort, Rhus had <br/>
  stopped the swing just slightly before the trophy could hit the <br/>
  wood.  <br/>
<br/>
  Then Lady Prisspott fainted.<br/>
<br/>
  The second of silence stretched to a seeming eternity.  Then, <br/>
  breaking the silence was heard "Excuse me." from the boxer who sat <br/>
  alone. Heads turned, many noticing the quiet man for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
  "Hi, I'm Poison Ivy" he said amicably "and, uh, I thought there would <br/>
  be beer."<br/>

Poison Ivy Hedge <poizniv@gmail.com> wrote:<br/>
"Welcome to the Great Letterboxing Contest!" read the sign at the <br/>
crowded picnic pavilion. Everyone was buzzing with excitement, <br/>
meeting and greeting folks and personas that they had only read about <br/>
online. Exclamations of "Oh, YOU'RE so-and-so?!" and "It's so good to <br/>
finally meet you!" and "I just LOVE your signature stamp! How do <br/>
you...." dominated the conversations. The morning gathering had the <br/>
look feel of a family reunion except no one resembled anyone else.  <br/>
All shapes, sizes, color, religion, sexual orientation, political <br/>
affiliation, social class and degrees of bathing habits were equally <br/>
represented and enjoying themselves.<br/>
<br/>
One bearded man, in a brown leather hat, camouflage pants and hiking <br/>
boots kept looking at his watch as he listened patiently and only <br/>
slightly disinterested to a thin New England couple explain about <br/>
carving techniques with an Exacto knife. It's true these New <br/>
Englanders could carve a mean stamp, but Rhus' mind was on the day's <br/>
event. He glanced once more at his watch then interrupted the lecture <br/>
with a smile and pat on the arm, "Sorry team, it's time to start this <br/>
thing. He stepped away and said smiling "We'll chat later okay?" then <br/>
climbed to the top of the picnic table.<br/>
<br/>
Rhus raised his hands and said loudly "Alright! It's....." looking at <br/>
his watch again "...now exactly two minutes to start!" He paused as <br/>
most of the people quieted down. Three women along the edge of the <br/>
group continued talking animatedly and giggling uncontrollably. <br/>
<br/>
When they noticed the quieted crowd, one of the women said "Shh! Shh! <br/>
It's starting!" The giggles turned to snorts, then louder giggles <br/>
then they covered their mouths and tried to put on innocent faces. <br/>
Just a couple more snorts and they were settled enough for Rhus to <br/>
continue.<br/>
<br/>
"Welcome to the Great Letterboxing Contest!" Rhus began as the <br/>
letterboxers all turned in his direction. "We will be starting in <br/>
just over a minute!"  With that announcement a number of folks, still <br/>
listening, began mentally checking their gear or patting their <br/>
pockets to make sure they had remembered everything they needed.  <br/>
Backpacks, fanniepacks, ink pads, watercolor markers, compasses, <br/>
clues, maps, stools, etc. A couple people made a quiet "Doh!" and <br/>
made a dash to their cars.<br/>
<br/>
"Before you are released, let me just remind you of the rules for <br/>
letterboxing, 'THERE ARE NO RULES' " Many smiled and nodded agreement <br/>
as some began to edge closer to their planned starting points with a <br/>
calculated nonchalance.<br/>
<br/>
Rhus reached down to lift and hold aloft a very nice looking wood, <br/>
marble and metal trophy. Two columns rose up on the side that were <br/>
topped with gold forms of hikers that looked to be struggling and <br/>
climbing toward the middle pedestal. The middle pedestal was marble. <br/>
Rising higher than the columns, it was topped with a larger gold form <br/>
of a Tupperware container.  The bottom of the pedestal had an <br/>
engraved, brass plaque which read "#1 Letterboxer" with the date and <br/>
the year below. It looked very nice, even in spite of the tarnishing <br/>
fingerprints of all the boxers who'd admired it covetously this <br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
"We will meet back here at the appointed hour, where and when we <br/>
will present this trophy to the winner of the Great Letterboxing <br/>
Contest!" A happy cheer went up with some applause and pats on backs <br/>
and slightly insincere well-wishing among the letterboxers. <br/>
<br/>
"Are you ready?" Rhus asked, feeding the excitement. The gathering <br/>
tensed.  Rhus looked at his watch and put a quieting finger in the <br/>
air, "GO!" he shouted, throwing down his hand, and like cockroaches <br/>
in a surprise flick of the light switch, the letterboxers scurried <br/>
off in all the different directions at once, some got themselves <br/>
quickly to their car, others ran through the field. Some paused mid-<br/>
step to examine their compass, shuffle in a circle then head off in a <br/>
daze.  Still, it wasn't half a minute before the entire area was <br/>
empty except for Rhus.<br/>
<br/>
"I thought they'd never leave" Rhus said to himself as he sat down on <br/>
the top of the table and fished a cigarette and Zippo out of his <br/>
pocket. He took another look at his watch then settled in for the <br/>
wait.<br/>
<br/>
At the appointed hour it looked like everyone had returned with <br/>
smiles on their faces and only a couple people limping but looking <br/>
triumphant. <br/>
<br/>
"What a great idea," Rhus thought, "With everyone having such a good <br/>
time, I hope they do this every year."<br/>
<br/>
"Welcome back!" Rhus grinned from his perch on the table. "I see you <br/>
all returned to the finish line on time and glad to see everyone's <br/>
none the worse for wear after a full day of letterboxing. Now, let's <br/>
see who gets the prize! Who won?"<br/>
<br/>
In startling unison, all but one of the letterboxers proudly <br/>
exclaimed "I did!" Then eyes narrowed as each looked at the others. <br/>
Mumbles began, "No, I did." "I'm the winner." "You didn't win!" The <br/>
mumbles turned into shouts. "You're an idiot!" "Shut up!" "I won!" <br/>
<br/>
The one quiet letterboxer still sat at a table during the ruckus and <br/>
looked around expectantly.<br/>
<br/>
"Wait a minute!" Rhus shouted, climbing to the top of the picnic <br/>
table, "There's some confusion here! If you would all calm down, we <br/>
can sort this out. <br/>
<br/>
By a quiet show of hands, who claims to have won?" All hands shot <br/>
skyward except for the lone boxer's at the table.<br/>
<br/>
"Okay, then, one at a time starting with you in the hunting vest," <br/>
Rhus facilitated, "how did you win?" <br/>
<br/>
The woman, fetching in the bright orange, spoke up, "Well, Rhus, as <br/>
you know, there are over 22 miles of trails in this park!  In fact, <br/>
there's 22.4 miles to be exact." she said smugly. "I hiked every last <br/>
inch of those trails getting all the  boxes in this park in one <br/>
visit. No one can claim to have hiked further today." Some nods of <br/>
amazed agreement sprinkled the group.<br/>
<br/>
"Now hold on!" cried a woman from the back. "Excuse me," she said, <br/>
snaking through the crowd to the front and stepping up on the seat of <br/>
the picnic table. "I happen to know that there are only 10 boxes <br/>
hidden in this park! Clearly I am the winner because I have found 24 <br/>
boxes today. 10 of the 12 in this park, 8 in the park down the road <br/>
and 4 individual boxes along the way."<br/>
<br/>
Responding to the puzzled looks of some of the boxers, Rhus quickly <br/>
did the math. "But that adds up to 22 boxes."<br/>
<br/>
"Oh," she said, "and 2 hitchhikers."<br/>
<br/>
"Hitchhikers don't count!" A couple by the trophy yelled <br/>
simultaneously. "They have to be 'pure' letterboxes to count!" said <br/>
the wife. "That's absolutely right," supported the husband as the <br/>
wife inched protectively toward the trophy. "Pure letterboxes are the <br/>
only things that count. One clue, one stamp, one log, one box equals <br/>
one F.  Hitchhikers don't have boxes or clues of their own so they <br/>
don't count.<br/>
<br/>
"No, no, no." Said an elderly woman seated in the midst.  The crowd <br/>
parted a bit and turned to the center. "The most important thing <br/>
about this event" she continued "are the people here. I made it a <br/>
point to meet and exchange with every person who attended here today. <br/>
Certainly no one else here can say that, so I am the winner."<br/>
<br/>
An uproarious guffaw was loosed from one of the three women who'd <br/>
reclaimed their spot at the edge. This, of course, caused the other <br/>
two women to burst into laughter themselves and clutch their chest <br/>
and side with giggles as they tried to catch their breath. <br/>
<br/>
"Oh come on!" the first of them panted between fits. <br/>
"We had SO much fun today!" squealed the second. <br/>
"We WIN!" shouted the third and they started an impromptu and awkward <br/>
square dance which ended in a pile of three bodies rolling in the <br/>
grass gasping for air with contented sighs.<br/>
<br/>
But that display didn't lighten the mood. It just caused the other <br/>

Ivy, loved your allegory but had 2 problems with the content:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Suggesting that letterboxers should "Follow the shoe" is <br/>
inappropriate on this forum especially since I think we should <br/>
follow the novelty socks.  <br/>
<br/>
2.  I was told there would be no math.<br/>
<br/>
Turn your partner round and round, that beer drinking dude ain't <br/>
made no sound,<br/>
