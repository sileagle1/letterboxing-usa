<br/>
Is there any interest in participating in a South Puget Sound <br/>
Letterbox Quest Fest on 2 Nov 02?  If there is enough interest, I <br/>
found the perfect 'slightly-larger-than-most-others-in-the-area' <br/>
park for it in Lakewood (with all sorts of nooks &amp; crannies &amp; <br/>
interesting &amp; odd history associated with it) and will be more than <br/>
happy to help coordinate such an event.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you think.  Even you 'LB enthusiast-LBNA-website-<br/>
lurkers' are welcome to respond...I know you're out there, I see <br/>
your stamps in the logbooks around this area!  ;)  <br/>

I've been hunting down letterboxes in the Seattle for the last week <br/>
or so, and I've got to say that these new letterboxes have some very <br/>
good stamps in them!<br/>
<br/>
I'd tell you which ones, but I'd probably get flogged for picking <br/>

&gt; Is there any interest in participating in a South Puget Sound<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Harvest Moon has already passed and my people are making ready<br/>
&gt; for the upcoming gathering.  Check your almanacs and the calendar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As is the tradition in letterboxing gatherings, I would welcome help<br/>
&gt; in placing special boxes in the area for the ocassion.  I have<br/>
&gt; already approached a gifted carver to create a piece of transferable<br/>
&gt; art for the event.  In addition, I have asked one of you to prepare a<br/>
&gt; special traveller that can only be found by divining the bearer.<br/>
&gt; Finally, clues to my identity can be found at the gathering where I<br/>
&gt; will reward the seeker in a special stamp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I invite you to congregate in the "longhouse" without sides by the<br/>
&gt; freshwater pond beginning two hours before moonrise to seek these<br/>
&gt; special stamps.  Your brethren have sprinkled the local area with a<br/>
&gt; surfeit of boxes.  I encourage you to have clues in hand to find the<br/>
&gt; local boxes, and placers of special boxes to post clues ahead or<br/>
&gt; bring them to the gathering.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One hour after moonrise we can break bread and exchange stamps<br/>
&gt; together.  Bring food to share and your own beverage and utensils to<br/>
&gt; sample the culinary art of your compatriots.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The fair Lady Alafair has agreed to provide a special journal for the<br/>
&gt; event for all to log their arrival.  I also beseech you to bring any<br/>
&gt; fine examples of your carving to imprint in the journal to share with<br/>
&gt; others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As always I welcome any questions and will cheerfully provide<br/>
&gt; information or directions for those who need their invitiation<br/>
&gt; deciphered.<br/>

&gt;   The unique HH 'My Favorite Things' was set free and hanging<br/>
&gt;   around 'high on the hill' with some crazy folks in Lakewood, WA on 2<br/>
&gt;   Oct 02.  If you happen to find it, please contribute a 'tiny, non-<br/>
&gt;   edible favorite thing' to its little collection.  We started it with<br/>
&gt;   a tiny clam shell, a pine cone and a money plant 'coin' from here in<br/>

&gt; 'I have confidence' that if you placed a box named 'Maria'<br/>
&gt; that 'something good' will happen especially if it's your 'sixteen<br/>
&gt; going on seventeen'th box that perhaps you won't, in a long while,<br/>
&gt; have to 'climb every mountain' or say 'so long, farewell' to your<br/>
&gt; letterboxes or letterboxing friends and adventures... ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, we're a household of Sound of Music fans.  My Mom lived a block<br/>
&gt; from the Von Trapp family's home in Salzburg in the 1950s, and, when<br/>
&gt; we lived in Germany for many years in the 1980s, we explored all the<br/>
&gt; various haunts that were included in scenes in the movie during<br/>
&gt; several trips to Austria.  Yes, we even danced in the gazebo and<br/>
&gt; played around the crypts under the church!  What better way to<br/>
&gt; incorporate your passion for various themes with the awesome hobby<br/>
&gt; of letterboxing!!!<br/>

&gt; Subject: VA Webmgr: Change in Rich Box Clues<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have replaced the underwater microbox in Forest Hill Park in<br/>
&gt; Richmond, VA, that went MIA very shortly after release. Please amend<br/>
&gt; the clues as follows:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Box #3: The Amusement Park<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THIS IS A MICRO BOX HIDDEN UNDERWATER. YOU WILL NEED A MICRO STAMP TO<br/>
&gt; STAMP INTO ITS LOGBOOK. IT DOES NOT CONTAIN A PENCIL.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Get back on the trail and take the left fork. Watch your step over the<br/>
&gt; tree roots that cross the trail beside a steep drop-off. Go to your<br/>
&gt; right onto the paved path down the hill. Go to your left onto the<br/>
&gt; paved walkway that you were on briefly after you stamped into Box #1.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Walk straight through the stone gazebo out its back arch. Begin<br/>
&gt; walking toward the bench and the lamp post at the back of the pond.<br/>
&gt; You will see a tree on your right before you get to the back of the<br/>
&gt; pond. The box is floating in the pond behind the tree. Look for the<br/>
&gt; orange string going down into the pond. It is attached to a hook stuck<br/>
&gt; in the ground beside the pond. Pull the jar out of the pond with the<br/>
&gt; string and stamp in. Reassemble everything and lower the jar back into<br/>
&gt; the pond.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This box commemorates that Forest Hill Park was an amusement park in<br/>
&gt; the early 1900s.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; For a first time and guaranteed success, I recommend "Get Into the Game"<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/va/getintog.htm which was placed with the<br/>
"First<br/>
&gt; Timer" in mind.  There have been lots of people who have stamped in to it.<br/>
&gt; Half the fun of this is reading all the stamps of the other who have gone<br/>
&gt; before.  "Turning Over a New Leaf" at<br/>
&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/md/dumpling.htm#leaf is in the same park and<br/>
&gt; only a short walk from where you parked to retrieve "Get Into the Game".<br/>
If<br/>
&gt; you look at both instructions together, it should be pretty easy to figure<br/>
&gt; out how to go from one to the other.  We did the "In the Park" series<br/>
&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/va/dominion.htm last Sunday.  They were all<br/>
&gt; brand new and probably still only have our stamps in them.  The Oak Marr<br/>
&gt; park one was a bit difficult to find, and you had to drive to a different<br/>
&gt; location for each box.  We did the "Gulf Branch letterboxes"<br/>
&gt; http://www.letterboxing.org/va/gulfbran.htm several weeks ago and really<br/>
&gt; enjoyed the park and hike.  I would recommend them highly.  If you are in<br/>
&gt; the mood to try a mystery box and don't mind a bit of a drive, I recommend<br/>
&gt; "Scrabble/Be Prepared" at http://www.letterboxing.org/va/scrabble.htm and<br/>
&gt; http://www.1bigred.com/users/jayc/letterbox/misc.htm#Be.  They are in the<br/>
&gt; same location which we really enjoyed.  I will warn you that Scrabble<br/>
itself<br/>
&gt; is difficult to find, however, failure there will not preclude you from<br/>
&gt; finding the other boxes in the series.  The other mystery box I would<br/>
highly<br/>
&gt; recommend is "Paris" at http://www.letterboxing.org/md/dumpling.htm#paris.<br/>
&gt; Once again it was a beautiful location and we really enjoyed being there.<br/>
&gt; Take heed though, the hike to the box is straight up, just as describe in<br/>
&gt; the instructions.<br/>

&gt; Hello fellow WA letterboxers,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Is there any interest in participating in a South Puget Sound <br/>
&gt; Letterbox Quest Fest on 2 Nov 02?  If there is enough interest, I <br/>
&gt; found the perfect 'slightly-larger-than-most-others-in-the-area' <br/>
&gt; park for it in Lakewood (with all sorts of nooks &amp; crannies &amp; <br/>
&gt; interesting &amp; odd history associated with it) and will be more than <br/>
&gt; happy to help coordinate such an event.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me know what you think.  Even you 'LB enthusiast-LBNA-website-<br/>
&gt; lurkers' are welcome to respond...I know you're out there, I see <br/>
&gt; your stamps in the logbooks around this area!  ;)  <br/>
&gt; Hope to hear from you soon,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
