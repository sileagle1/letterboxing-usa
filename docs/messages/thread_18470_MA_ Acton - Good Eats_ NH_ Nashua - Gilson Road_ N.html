I took my friend out letterboxing for the first time yesterday - her name <br/>
is Mac Attack and she's from Stratford, CT. I don't know how she has been <br/>
living in CT for her entire life and has never heard of letterboxing. What <br/>
makes it worse is that we met when we were roommates at Quinnipiac College, <br/>
which is across the street from Sleeping Giant, home of about 87,172,583 <br/>
boxes. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we decided to check out the Good Eats box in Acton, MA, being major <br/>
Mexican food fiends (the current theme). All is well - many visitors, looks <br/>
like a hitchhiker or two has passed through and it is a great hiding spot.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch, we headed up to check on the NH Ghosts and Gilson Road <br/>
letterboxes in Nashua, NH - my first two finds. I pulled Gilson Road for <br/>
some major refurbishment (logbook full, stamp pad dry, needs new baggies, <br/>
etc.) and it is currently sitting on my kitchen table... I just need to <br/>
make a copy of the explanation page that Aisling had in the original <br/>
logbook and put it into the new one. I plan to replace it at some point <br/>
today, at which point I will pull the NH Ghosts box to replace that <br/>
logbook, as it is close to full. I will be putting that one back within a <br/>
day or two as well.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, it was a nice first day of letterboxing for Mac Attack (who <br/>
was dreaming up all sorts of new boxes while driving home) and a great way <br/>
to kick off the letterboxing season for me.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails! :)<br/>

Thanks for the update on Good Eats.  I'm glad to hear that all is <br/>
well.  I need to get started on my next stamp for this box.  I'm <br/>
thinking it's time for some Ice Cream :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
