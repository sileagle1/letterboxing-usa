Hello to all. For those people that may have recovered from the MMM ( <br/>
hopefully, I will have!) , We (Koyote, Rush Gatherer, and PowWow <br/>
Dancer)will be meeting for the start of our new Native American <br/>
series, "The Four Directions". This will occur next Saturday, October <br/>
9th, from 10 a.m. to 2p.m. at Mohawk State Forest in Cornwall Ct. <br/>
Rain date Oct. 10th, weather permitting. We will be at the Wm. <br/>
Strattman homestead site. This informal rendevous is to kick off the <br/>
series and to assist those that may need some help finding their way <br/>
around our remote area and trails. There will be an event stamp <br/>
commemorating the series carved by Rush Gatherer. This is a BYO <br/>
picnic lunch. There may be a few "prizes" about as well. I will post <br/>
more info on Mark Pepe's site in the next day or so. We strongly <br/>
encourage people to buddy up at the event to park a second car at the <br/>
end of the various trails. Hikes will be very long otherwise. Sorry.. <br/>
No loop trails on this one. Clues will be available at the end of the <br/>
week. There is an abundance of other boxes in the near vicinity also. <br/>
Please e-mail myself or Rush Gatherer off list if you plan on <br/>
attending. Safe trails to all.<br/>
                          Koyote <br/>
