                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found The Happy Camper yesterday.  It is located in a lovely city <br/>
park not too far from my house.  The day was overcast and warm, but <br/>
not a sauna that this area can be.<br/>
<br/>
The city is doing construction to the base area of<br/>
Lewis &amp; Clark so sitting on Seaman's tail is<br/>
impossible right now, but we got close enough to<br/>
extrapolate which tree we needed to find from that<br/>
point.  We went through all the steps despite knowing<br/>
where the final clue is without even walking downtown.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think that I've ever read the sign and there was a cute <br/>
little frog at the base of it--my son has never seen a real frog <br/>
before!  That was really exciting for him.<br/>
<br/>
This was a fun box--I'll return once I get a personal<br/>
stamp carved.  It's been a while since I boxed;  I'd forgotten how <br/>
long it takes to pull everything out and look at it, stamp up, and <br/>
get it all back together...all without attracting attention!  There <br/>
weren't too many people around, though.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped at our favorite neighborhood pub for dinner of fish &amp; <br/>
chips on the way back--finally got there early enough to get them hot <br/>
from the fryer!  Yum!<br/>
