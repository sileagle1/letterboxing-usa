9-13-03 by Salamander. Difficulty: Easy. This letterbox is hidden <br/>
near a body of water, so I think the title is most appropriate, <br/>
although the largest vessel I have ever seen sailing this waterway <br/>
was a modified VW Beetle ( really---I am NOT kidding).  CLUES: Go to <br/>
Chillicothe's downtown area. You must locate a red caboose, #C3893. <br/>
There is ample parking in the area. From the caboose, start walking <br/>
west along the sidewalk until you come to a small, nicely landscaped <br/>
patio with 2 gray benches. Stand between the benches and take a <br/>
compass reading of 52 degrees. There is a small bush at that <br/>
heading. The box is hidden directly in the center of this bush, near <br/>
its base. <br/>
