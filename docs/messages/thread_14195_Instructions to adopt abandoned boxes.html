&lt;&lt; The problem with doing it this way is that the box will be listed<br/>

as both abandoned and owned by the new person. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the Abandoned Boxes will soon be deleted--which will leave <br/>
the newly-adopted boxes happily in place under someone else's <br/>
name.  The beauty of it is that the boxing community can solve <br/>
this on our own, without giving one more job to the webmasters.<br/>
<br/>
Springchick has an excellent suggestion!  Add one additional step: <br/>
search under the box's name to make sure no one in your area has <br/>
already adopted the box (or that the owner hasn't already listed <br/>
it under their own name, and it's just duplicated in the abandonedbox list).<br/>

If you are the owner of a box listed as abandoned--and you have NOT already <br/>
submitted it under your own name--you can contact the webmasters by <br/>
sending an e-mail to the list-serve with the words<br/>
"Attn: Webmaster--PA" (or whatever state you're in).  In the message<br/>
part, you write "I am the owner of Around the Bend letterbox in Peterson <br/>
County, PA.  Please transfer it to me at <br/>
yourletterboxingaddress@company.com  Thank you!  Your Name"  <br/>
(If your area is divided into regions, you might add "in region 2" <br/>
or whatever after the county name.)<br/>
<br/>
If you are the owner of a box listed as abandoned but you have also <br/>
already submitted it, it seems to me that you have no problem, and <br/>
don't have to do anything at all.   The abandoned boxes<br/>
will disappear, but your box under your name will of course remain. <br/>
(As Wes explained in an earler e-mail, some boxes might be listed under<br/>
AbandonedBox while also having been entered by a current boxer.  This <br/>
would have happened during the transfer to the new system.  When I <br/>
went to enter one of my boxes, I found the webmasters had already <br/>
done so.  I contacted Wes [as was instructed] and asked him to transfer the <br/>
box to my name--using the method I described in the previous paragraph.<br/>
He worked his magic, and lo &amp; behold, the box was mine!)<br/>
