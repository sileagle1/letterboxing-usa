Psychomommy, you were at Black Hills yesterday at the exact same time <br/>
as me and Sarah.  We started with the Shore box and placed the <br/>
hitcher there.  We then headed to the other side of Picnic Lane to <br/>
find the Blair Witch box.  I don't know if you started with Blair <br/>
Witch or came to the park after we left the Shore box but you found <br/>
it right after we placed it! That is some wild and wacky timing!<br/>
<br/>
We probably saw each other in the parking lot!  This kind of strange <br/>
coincidence is what makes this so much fun!<br/>
<br/>
I will have to call Sarah at home and tell her.<br/>
<br/>
This hobby rocks! (pardon the pun)<br/>

I've spent the past two days wandering around VA finding many G-Man boxes.  I think it's official - I am addicted.<br/>
