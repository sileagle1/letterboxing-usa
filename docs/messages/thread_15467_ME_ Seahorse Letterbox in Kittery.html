                    <div class="plaintext-content">This box has been reported missing several times recently and the <br/>
owner was not replying to e-mails inquiring about its status. We <br/>
decided we'd try for it anyway and wanted to let folks know that the <br/>
box is indeed there. However, I worry that people have been trampling <br/>
around and digging up places in searching for it - in fact there is no <br/>
digging that is required. We are friends with someone whose father <br/>
manages that site and he is concerned about the impact it is having. I <br/>
don't want to give anything away, but out of concern for the habitat, <br/>
and to make sure the letterbox is allowed to stay there, please check <br/>
to make sure you have the right tree before taking your second <br/>
compass reading - it truly is a granite point as the clue says. <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
