<br/>
Yesterday we had the first gathering in the southeast, and it was a <br/>
blast! We had fifty-six in attendance (including dogs and infants) <br/>
from six states, and had beautiful weather in a great park to <br/>
compliment the festivities. We did a rough estimate of how many stamp <br/>
images were created and/or collected, and came up with a ballpark <br/>
guess of 2300. We'll be posting photos on Tuesday in the Yahoo Group <br/>
letterbox-southeast. Wish y'all coulda been there!<br/>
<br/>
Our thanks go out to all who provided how-to tips, online <br/>
suggestions, and travelling event stamps. You helped make this a huge <br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is booming in the southeast, so if you ever find <br/>
yourself with vacation plans in this area, stop on in and sit a spell.<br/>

Stone Mountain, but the word "letterboxing" entered my vocabulary <br/>
less than a week ago, so I couldn't cancel Sunday's plans in time to <br/>
attend.  <br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to hear about the next gathering!!  Count me in for <br/>
it.  :D  Must find your SE yahoo group, too...<br/>
