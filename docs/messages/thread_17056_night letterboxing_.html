sure why not? I think only if I know the area - and if it feels right. I wouldn't <br/>
otherwise just take off wandering aimlessly into the woods.<br/>

<br/>
good on that 'cuz it's a personal preference...I think some people only do <br/>
boxing at night some ribnagers for instance perhaps (might still box!?) at night<br/>
<br/>
Since boxing I have invested in a headlamp and personal flashlight that I keep <br/>
only in the car for such reasons. I often check on my own boxes at night <br/>
because I frequent those places at least once a week and to eliminate any <br/>
possibility of running into other boxers for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
Portland (Maine) for instance is not a place that people would necessarily just <br/>
wander at night unless you were from that area and already knew what you <br/>
were getting into. So, for myself - I wander at night all the time wihout fear for <br/>
the most part but with a heavy dose of common sense about it. I don't have <br/>
kids which also helps. I'd never dream of taking kids out boxing at night unless <br/>
it were for a special reason - Oh such as to witness a lunar eclipse over a lake <br/>
for instance (drewclan...) :-) smiles...<br/>

<br/>
Is there an ethical issue involved with walking around after dark?  I <br/>
wouldn't necessarily stop letterboxing just because it was dark out, <br/>
but it does tend to make it more difficult to find the letterbox so I <br/>
rarely do it.<br/>
<br/>
But oh, I do love a great night hike when the moon is full and the <br/>
sky is clear.  It's so exhilerating hiking at night without using a <br/>
light.  Not that I don't carry a light source while hiking at night--<br/>
I always carry it in case I do end up needing it for a tricky part on <br/>
the trail--but usually I don't use it.<br/>

Check out my clues to  A Night on Lebabnon Green( N.E. Ct. )meant to <br/>
be a night box it is a lit and safe town green and a beauty at that. <br/>
I do know many have done it in the day but the night is cool <br/>
especially with a nip in the air the night makes the imagination work <br/>
with the clues so well.  It was inspired by an  earlier strain of <br/>
discussion here but it took me awhile to come up with a safe  place <br/>
that was "open " after dark most parks close at sunset around here. <br/>
Anyway it is about perfect for history and  a nice safe walk on a <br/>
trail of crushed stone dust. Try it You'll like it! Leader of the pack<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, seeing as I have probably boxed more at night than during light in the past year, I'll answer your question from my perspective and experience.<br/>
<br/>
Top 10 Reasons for boxing at night:<br/>
<br/>
10.)  Insomnia<br/>
9.)  You're a working stiff who squeezes in boxing whenever you can.<br/>
8.)  You always run late.<br/>
7.)  The directions got you all mixed up and lost.<br/>
6.)  You got the directions all mixed up, and got yourself lost.<br/>
5.)  You lost the directions. Then you got lost.<br/>
4.)  Three words: Daylight Saving Time.<br/>
3.)  You are a wicked techgeek with a GPS *and* a night scope.<br/>
2.)  Some boxes, like ones near the water, just beg to be done under moonlight, such as Midnight on the Moon.<br/>
And the #1 reason for boxing at night: <br/>
You have just had a revelation as to the whereabouts of a Mystery Box and you just can't wait to find out if you are right!!!<br/>
<br/>
There are other reasons for boxing at night.  Sometimes the place is just so busy with people during the day that night offers a cover.  There may still be some foot traffic at night, but you can go about boxing less noticed.  <br/>
<br/>
Another reason is *sometimes* a box is hidden in an "unapproved"  or since closed location.  You may not be hurting anyone, but you want to stealth box so as not to get in trouble.  For example, a friend and I searched for a box on a closed bridge because we would be shooed away during the daylight, and possibly fined a few (5!) hundred dollars apiece.  But the main reason this area was closed off to foot traffic is because butthead slobs had constantly got drunk and littered while fishing there.  It was actually a thrill to be doing something "naughty." <s>  We didn't harm anything or anybody.  The view was superb, and quite pretty at night.  Now, I feel I should tell you that I had pedaled a bicycle over this span before the state closed it to traffic.  Why would pedaling a bike on a 2-foot wide steel catwalk on a narrow bridge in heavy traffic and in almost always windy conditions be safe and lawful, but walking up it after it was closed to traffic be unsafe and unlawful? Inquiring minds want to know...  We could have a long discussion about my state and how the lawmakers chose to regulate the law-abiding to make up for the problems caused by the people who have disregard for the laws, the rights of others, and the environment.  But you don't want any ethical debates so I won't get into it!<br/>
<br/>
Generally, though, we are not going anywhere illegal, nor immoral.  Much of the coastline in RI is open to residents, even at night, as long as you follow the posted regulations and parking restrictions.  We have political action groups and individuals who fight long and hard to keep the right-of-way paths to the shore open to people for fishing and recreational enjoyment.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't go anywhere at night that I don't feel very comfortable going to or into.  I will leave or nix plans when something just says, "not a good idea."  I have turned down night trips because there was something clearly unsafe about the area or weather conditions, even if I took a long ride there and reconsidered at the last moment.  I never box alone at night.  I always have an extra flashlight and batteries, a walkie-talkie, and a cell phone.  <br/>
<br/>
There have been a few times when night boxing has just been creepy.  I swear I can feel and hear *something* out there so I get the hell out of there, even if I tell myself I am imagining things.  The creepy things are noises that sound like something moving in the brush, cracking twigs, or sudden absolute dead quiet.  I don't often feel anything necessarily human or malicious, but feel like I'm being watched.  Good enough reason to leave.  If we have our dog (big dog!) with us and the dog gets edgy, we leave.<br/>
<br/>
Once we boxed by lantern at night in a state park because we were out-of-state and we wanted to reach our goal before we took the long trip home.  We had boxed most of the day in the rain and had run out of daylight to get the last 3 boxes.  Sometimes we are just driven to follow through.  <s><br/>
<br/>
Tonight we did 2 RI coastal boxes.  Midnight on the Moon we did from memory, because I did it over 2 yrs. ago and remembered enough of the clues to point Dan to it.  We didn't have the clues with us but had intended to get it whenever in the area.  We did "Just Bass" after that.  We were utterly alone with the wild wind, flying spray, the sound of pounding surf, and the almost quarter moon. Dan practiced taking pictures.  We didn't have to wait around for people to leave the area so we could find and replace the boxes.  It's nice to feel like you don't have to be sneaky to keep the boxes safe from nosey strangers. <br/>
<br/>
The *main* reason we were boxing in the dark tonight is because we spent our afternoon daylight hours doing things for other people. <s><br/>
<br/>
I hope somehow my personal view of Nocturnal Boxing helps you understand at least one or two person's reasons for boxing at night.<br/>

<br/>
I have letterboxed at night, but it wasn't intentional.  It was usually <br/>
when I have driven great distances for some boxes and I get to <br/>
that last one and it involves a hike.  I start out hoping I will make it <br/>
back before dark, but logically realizing there is a good chance I <br/>
won't.  I still delude myself into believing it will be really quick and <br/>
I go for it.  <br/>
<br/>
For the most part, I have been fine.  I am pretty safety conscious <br/>
about things, and I don't tend to push through if I am out alone.  <br/>
This summer I had one hike where I hit an overlook on a <br/>
Wyoming mountain just at an amazing spot in the sunset.  It was <br/>
so beautiful.  It still took us a bit to find the letterbox, and we <br/>
came off the mountain in total dark, but I had so much fun <br/>
looking for that box.  It was a favorite letterboxing moment.<br/>

&gt; I have read some entries in letterboxes that mentioned they were found<br/>

Not when I can help it.  I find it difficult to make accurate compass<br/>
readings and I'm reluctant to go cross-country when I can't see the<br/>
ground well enough to avoid tripping.  It's especially tough in the<br/>
winter months when 'dark' happens so much sooner after getting out of<br/>
work.  I made the mistake of going after "Eternal Flame" (Western NY)<br/>
in mid-afternoon.  The trail was longer than I originally expected. <br/>
Coming back out, some where in the dim light, I crossed from one trail<br/>
into another and ended up coming out of the park nearly four miles<br/>
from where I had parked the car.  Now my rule is, if I can't read the<br/>
compass going in, I'll save the box for another time.<br/>
