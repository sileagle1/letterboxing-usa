You know, I was kind of wondering about that. Was there ANYONE who<br/>
thought, "Gee, perhaps riding a bike might get me out of town a bit<br/>
quicker?"<br/>
<br/>
I'd imagine motorcycles must have been popular and quite successful as<br/>
well, because I didn't see any of them in any of the pictures I saw.<br/>
But I'd imagine most people wouldn't have access to a motorcycle. But<br/>
I bet there were a lot of lonely bicycles in Houston that could have<br/>
help reduce congestion and the bike riders could have ridden circles<br/>
around the cars.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm not dissing car drivers--don't get me wrong. Some people<br/>
have families and riding a bike with three children on your back may<br/>
not be practical, but I'm sure there were lots of people who could<br/>
have made use of more primitive forms of transportation and had much<br/>
better experiences to show for their effort!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I think a bicycle would be an excellent investment for evacuating<br/>
from a large city. Nobody runs out of gas on a bicycle. Flat tires,<br/>
perhaps, but those can be patched easily enough. =)<br/>

Makes an interesting picture..... a couple of million folks who drive <br/>
everywhere suddenly getting on their bikes for a quick couple of <br/>
hundred miles......<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if it was Ryan, he'd be planting boxes along the way and <br/>
we'd all be retracing his path next summer, eh? :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> It's been close to 100 degrees here and the humidity is at least 80%; ozone<br/>
warnings are the norm. Houston is huge. We are not the largest city<br/>
population-wise, but we are the largest city as far as land goes. If it<br/>
takes me an hour, under optimal traffic conditions and on freeways at speeds<br/>
of 55 or higher, to get from SW Houston to NW Houston, how long would it<br/>
take me on a bike?  How would I carry enough water and food? Clothing? Meds?<br/>
Insurance papers and other important documents? A few precious photos or<br/>
mementos? Remember, I'm thinking I may be coming back to nothing but a pile<br/>
of rubble or a lake where my subdivision used to be. For the majority of<br/>
people here, bike riding is a fun outing, but not practical transportation<br/>
due to the distances we have to travel, the heat and humidity, and the<br/>
unpredictable weather.<br/>
