Well he's coming home for a visit, so the Brat Pack is hosting a gathering<br/>
and what's a gathering without games? <br/>
<br/>
You are hereby invited to join us at Wall Street Pizza  in Gresham, Oregon<br/>
for a letterboxing version of "Clue". Thanks to Scarab of the Doubtful<br/>
Guests, we are going to get to use the set of 22 stamps they put together.<br/>
Can you figure out who did it in which room and with which weapon before<br/>
anyone else does? Can you collect all the stamps? <br/>
<br/>
We already have RSVP's from lots of old friends and new, I hope you see YOU<br/>
there as well. <br/>
<br/>
Those that RSVP in time will recieve an email about 3 days before the event<br/>
with a list of all local boxes and about how much time to allot for them if<br/>
you're interested in combinding some boxing with the gathering!<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions, please email me at maiden1974@verizon.net<br/>
