&gt;wanted to leave them exposed, who am I to butt in.  From what you<br/>
<br/>
The kids are really enjoying reading about people finding their boxes!<br/>
<br/>
I am trying, as much as possible, to let them learn from their own mistakes<br/>
on this - anyone who has visited their first two plantings up near Lake<br/>
Arrowhead would be amazed at how much better the Franklin Canyon series is<br/>
in comparison. I feel their stamps are improving as well, now mixing cute<br/>
stick figures/geometric designs with some computer generated artwork.<br/>
<br/>
As for planting, initially they were trying to make them "easy for kids to<br/>
find," having expressed frustration over digging around in "icky" places for<br/>
other boxes :) But they were thrilled over the story of someone going back<br/>
to look a second time for a box, proud of themselves (and Buzzard, who, by<br/>
the way, is well spoken of by them as they've seen his stamps in many local<br/>
books) for hiding it so well. So I would expect, over the next few weeks,<br/>
their hiding abilities will begin to improve.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the local people making a small bunch of kids (they adored<br/>
being called a posse) excited about hiking, geography, map/compass skills,<br/>
art, travel... too many areas to list off. One of them is entering a small<br/>
display in the Los Angeles County Fair in September, if anyone happens to<br/>
make it by building 22 be sure and keep a look out for it. He's planning a<br/>
special stamp that one can only find by looking at his display.<br/>

PS They are planting in Malibu the next two weeks, in case anyone wanted to<br/>
plan ahead :)<br/>
