I know this is very last minute, but anyone want to meet for lunch at the Food Court of Park Plaza Mall tomorrow from 11 am to 1 pm or so? Park Plaza Mall is located at 6000 West Markham Street, Little Rock, Arkansas. I've never been there before, so I can't say where to meet, but hubby and I will be sitting close to Back Yard Burgers and we will have letterbox containers on our table (personal travellers, signature stamp, ltc's, etc). Bring your travellers, ltc's etc for stamping and swapping while we have lunch. I know this is last minute, but I hope some can join us. We only live 2 hours away in Memphis, and would love to meet some Arkansas Letterboxers. We are staying the weekend, so if a different time or if Sunday is better, let us know and we will change the meet-up time.<br/>
