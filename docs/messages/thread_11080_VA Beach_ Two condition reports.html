<br/>
    Meditation Garden at the ARE building was a DNF for at least a dozen<br/>
volksmarschers Saturday. We put our registration table about 50 feet from<br/>
the location. Several of us had the clue and we passed it around. No joy. A<br/>
prior finder or the owner might want to check on it.<br/>
<br/>
    Long Creek Seahorse in First Landing is still there. It has one blank<br/>
page remaining in the log book. The book and info sheet was in good shape.<br/>
The stamp seems to have a small chip in it. Still a fun easy find.<br/>
