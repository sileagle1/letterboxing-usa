has happened.<br/>
<br/>
Horrible, no--worse than that--DREADFUL news has occured!  You can save <br/>
yourself a lot of anguish--anguish, meaning of course, something similar to <br/>
being hung by your toenails over an active volcano while smeared with red <br/>
meat and surrounded by a pack of hungry wolves--by not reading any further.  <br/>
This clue really is simply too awful for such a nice, happy place such as <br/>
this talk list, but alas, it is my duty to the Baudelaire orphans that <br/>
forces me to post anyhow.<br/>

<br/>
I must once again go into hiding.  The FBI are getting too close.  If you <br/>
don't hear from me within a year, assume the worst and please, whatever you <br/>
do, trust no one.<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect,<br/>
