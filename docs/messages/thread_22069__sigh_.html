<br/>
I have bitten my tongue for two days now looking at<br/>
the drivel posted on the list because SOMEONE got<br/>
defensive when a moderator (or just plain someone<br/>
else) told them to STOP. How hard is this? Do we<br/>
really need to know all the reasons why you can't take<br/>
the conversation somewhere else? NO! I'm FURIOUS<br/>
because someone who is a class-act and all-around<br/>
great letterboxer, BOXDN, is considering dropping out<br/>
of letterboxing because of the population of idiots<br/>
who continually show poor nettiquette on this list. I<br/>
see his point. I wouldn't want people that can't<br/>
figure out how to be civil on a list-serve to be<br/>
looking for my boxes either. I hope that he can<br/>
somehow find a way to continue on with the hobby, as<br/>
he really is a great placer. I'll be sad to see his<br/>
boxes go. <br/>
<br/>
As a former moderator of several lists, it might be<br/>
helpful to define some of the basic rules of<br/>
nettiquette in the initial e-mail that all new<br/>
memebers receive. I know you shouldn't have to spell<br/>
things out for an adult population, but believe me, it<br/>
cuts down on some of the moronic ways that people act<br/>
on a list-serve. Sometimes a paragraph about multiple<br/>
posts, one-line posts, PLB etc can prevent some of<br/>
this hoopla. Just a suggestion. <br/>
<br/>
In the spirit of good nettiquette, please direct<br/>
flames and disagreement to my personal e-mail. Thank<br/>
you.<br/>
