WILD EYED THINGS THAT PEEK THROUGH THE LIMBS MYSTERY LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Somewhere in the greater Grants Pass, Josephine County, Oregon <br/>
area.<br/>
DROPPED:  November 28, 2002, by half the Horse Trap Gang.<br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY:  We just think we are so clever :)<br/>
<br/>
(If you find any problems with this box or wish to share any successes, etc., <br/>
please email Annette at ARoseLb@aol.com.)<br/>
<br/>
CLUE:  <br/>
Just feel lucky that you aren't one of the Wild Eyed things that peek through <br/>
the limbs of those four fir trees over there.  Imagine, every time a baseball <br/>
got hit over the left field fence, your life would be in danger!  The <br/>
fountain is nice, but those crazy fisherman could start casting, the hook <br/>
might go hither and thither, landing under the branches and hooking onto <br/>
something, er, personal, if ya know what I mean.  I like the volleyball <br/>
courts too.  Its just that those volleyball players miss sometimes and the <br/>
volleyball rolls into the fir trees, messing up your home.  Let's just say, a <br/>
Wild Eyed thing has the right to a safe home, just like any other person.  <br/>
The worst thing is that compass!  That W points at my Wild Eyed friends -- <br/>
You might as well just label it Wild Eyed Things over there and have done <br/>
with it.  At least living under the tallest of the four firs holds some extra <br/>
comfort.  <br/>
