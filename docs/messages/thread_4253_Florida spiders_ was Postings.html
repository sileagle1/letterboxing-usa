We only had time to find 2 of the 3 letterboxes, but both had had 2 or 3 <br/>
visitors besides ourselves. We found the Celebration Box and the Wilderness <br/>
Lodge Box. We didn't come across any big spiders, thankfully. We did see an <br/>
alligator doing laps in the little pond described in the Celebration clues.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Be prepared to dodge some spider webs....BIG spider webs, with BIG<br/>
&gt; &gt;spiders.<br/>

&gt; &gt;All the best,<br/>

&gt;I think you are referring to what we call Bannana Spiders where I<br/>
&gt;grew up in Florida. We do grow them BIG down here. I _strongly_<br/>
&gt;suggest that anyone who decides to go into the woods (particularly<br/>
&gt;wetlands) off well marked trails down here carry a spider stick. Any<br/>
&gt;stick will do and you just wave it in front of you like a magic wand<br/>
&gt;to pull down any spider webs before you walk into them. I can tell<br/>
&gt;you from  experiences it is no fun to get tangled in one of those<br/>
&gt;webs with a spider as big as your hand who is not very happy. The<br/>
&gt;bright side is I don't believe they are poisonous, just scary.<br/>
