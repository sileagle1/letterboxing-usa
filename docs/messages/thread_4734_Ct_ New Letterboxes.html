Two boxes Planted by Butterfly
<br/>Name: Adventure at Brooksvale
<br/>Planted : March 18,2002
<br/>Where: Hamden Ct.
<br/>Distance : Under 2 miles
<br/>                                             
Adventure at Brooksvale Park
<br/>Brooksvale Park is located on the west side of Brooksvale Road in Hamden
,Ct.
<br/>Enter the driveway with the sign , BROOKSVALE PARK
<br/>Drive past the parking lot on the left which is for the bike trail
and zoo Parking only, and continue past the red barn which is on the right.
Drive up the hill curving to the right and park in the small parking lot
by the educational building.
<br/>Walk back up the drive in a southerly direction to the trail head and
the map board [which is need of repair]
<br/>Walk on the main trail in a westerly direction to a 'y'. Take the trail
to the left. It travels up hill and passes several 'camp' building off
in the woods on both sides. Pass a small trail on the left and continue
on to the next 'y'. A tree is growing in the center of the intersection.
Tale the trail going right and look south--straight ahead -- at a group
of rocks in the woods a little way off the trail. Bushwhack to the rocks
and notice the largest one is split and has a tree formed around the side
of the rock. Look on the south side of the rock under some small rocks
and sticks. The HAPPY KIDS LETTERBOX is hidden there. Stamp in and carefully
rehide the box.
<br/>Continue on the trail as it climbs and is rocky. A stone wall can be
see off in the woods on the left. The woods here are lovely hard wood trees
in this forest and the trail dips and turns, climbs and descends and makes
several "S"s  As the trail narrows a bit, watch carefully on your
right for a large four [4] sister tree close to the trail. Stand on the
east side of the tree and walk about 18 steps east to a small cairn. Look
carefully on the east side of the cairn and only moving the eastern most
rock you will find the SMILE LETTERBOX  in a hole.
<br/>Smile, and stamp in then rehide carefully.
<br/>Enjoy the hike out and you will see several huge pine 'nooning' trees
on your left. When the trail curves left, you come upon  a 'mystery'
cabin in the woods. At the next junction  both right trail will take
you back to your car, with the shortest route being the  right right
!!!
<br/>Also, at this junction you may want to turn left and follow the <i>Grinning
Ninny</i> clues to find the Grinning Ninny letterbox that is now being 
repaired and replaced.
<br/>I hope you have enjoyed a happy adventure at Brooksvale park.
