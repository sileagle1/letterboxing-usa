I promised I would post this. <br/>
http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-<br/>
usa/vwp?.dir=/CheeseRacing&amp;.dnm=JugglerMouse+%26+Scabbers.jpg&amp;.src=gr<br/>
<br/>
It is JugglerMouse and Scabbers finding the GSD Letterbox "Scabbers" <br/>
with a RL visit from Trevor the Toad. Completely unscripted.<br/>
<br/>
I put it in Cheese Racing to remind us all that Cheeseracing can kill <br/>
tiny animals like Trevor. It is wrong; it is violent; it only appeals <br/>
to rats. Help us stamp out cheeseracing. Vote in the poll online. <br/>
Tell them that it is wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

I show that I am not a sore loser, that I have indeed tasted the wine <br/>
of victory and not just the sour grapes of defeat. And though I may <br/>
hate the abomination of cheese racing, I still love those who still <br/>
partake in such. What else can one do?<br/>
<br/>
And yes, should the occasion arise that I might win back converts to <br/>
its opposition, I will once again take the gridiron with my Kraft <br/>
well in hand. <br/>

I need to clarify, here.  Sir Balthazar won ONE heat.  He was elated <br/>
at that moment; cheeseracing was suddenly the greatest thing since <br/>
sliced cheese, thus the charming smile in the photo.   But that was <br/>
the last cheeseracing victory he won - he has lost every other <br/>
cheeseracing he has competed in since.<br/>
<br/>
We could be charitable and say it is enough to turn anyone against a <br/>
sport, but the truth is I am disappointed at the sour milk attitude <br/>
he is showing here.  When he starts exploiting cute animal pictures <br/>
to win others over on this anti-cheeseracing crusade of his, I say <br/>
he has gone too far.  Yes, I know he apologized for that, and I <br/>
applaud him for that, at least.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, until you have seen the square pillows inflate for <br/>
yourself, you can't know the thrill of the sport.  Vote today to <br/>
show your support!!<br/>
