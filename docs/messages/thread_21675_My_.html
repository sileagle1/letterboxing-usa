  Just curious.  I'm on the auto-announce for planted letterboxes and have seen many come through with a state of "MY" and a county of "mystery".  I don't know of any state with the abbreviation of MY.  Does this mean that someone posted the box and it was a total mystery as to the state and county?<br/>

I was wondering how to get to virtual boxes at LBNA.  Do you think other<br/>
virtual box placers have done the same thing?<br/>

Anybody have any suggestions for a better place for me to switch them over to?<br/>
