Location: San Luis Obispo, California<br/>

Clues: Pretty easy.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere on Lower Higuera, a "totem pole" guards the entrance to a <br/>
trailer park.  O.k., so this particular post is meant to reference <br/>
the more local native people that give the park it's name, and I mean <br/>
no disrespect to anyone in or out of this mobile home village, but <br/>
I'm stretching the point to include it in my Alaskan series.  <br/>
On the island of the pole, pass the furthest palm tree, and check the <br/>
nearest cluster of rocks.  The rock with the almost crescent-like <br/>
shape hides box # 1.<br/>
<br/>
Within a mile from box # 1, on a street more high than lower Higuera, <br/>
constantly restored advertising mural first painted in the 1950's <br/>
decorates the side of a deli named for the street it is on.  This <br/>
deli, by the way, has one of the best selections of gourmet soda pops <br/>
in the area.  From the mural head one full block at 315 degrees, to a <br/>
corner.  From that corner, about a half block at 210 degrees will <br/>
take you very near to box # 2.  It is under a rock very near a <br/>
prominent plumbing fixture.  Private side note to The Badger on this <br/>
box: "Hi-die hi-die hi-die hi, ho-die ho-die ho-die ho."<br/>
