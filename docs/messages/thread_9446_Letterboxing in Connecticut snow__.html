<p>I was wondering the same thing.  I can't imagine it would be an issue 
  in the woods on a trail but I don't think I can do rtrw's drive up in Hartford 
  because it would be too obvious.  Maybe instead of covering our tracks 
  when we get near the boxes we should make lots of extra tracks to confuse the 
  "destructive types".

Yes, I have noticed it also. The leaves get trampled on the path <br/>
that follows the clues.  I have noticed it in Connecticut forests <br/>
even where the box shows that there are maybe a dozen visitors <br/>
during the year.  Usually the trampled leaves are not noticable to <br/>
anyone who is not trained as an animal tracker. I don't think the <br/>
general public would notice.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, silly us. We went out to get John Tom's Hill in Glastonbury <br/>
today, and even though there WAS a trampled trail in the snow, we <br/>
walked right by it. We went all the way out to the Shenipsit trail, <br/>
then turned around and found it on the way back.  It was a very nice <br/>
hike, and we found lots of different animal tracks in the snow, don't <br/>
know how we ever missed people tracks!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the stamp came unglued from its wooden backer. No biggie, it made <br/>
a nice impression in our books anyway! :)<br/>
