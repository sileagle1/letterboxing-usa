With the success of finding our first letter box so easily, we tried <br/>
to find this one North of Greensboro today.  We did fine with the <br/>
instructions until we got to the bridges. We found many bridges-one <br/>
guarded by a large black snake-but no trails from them.  We ran out <br/>
of time after two and a half hours in the woods and had to leave.  <br/>
Any help will be appreciated for our next journey there.  Off list <br/>
would be fine.  They are trimming a lot of the trees in the woods so <br/>
there were plenty of stumps and trees all over.<br/>
