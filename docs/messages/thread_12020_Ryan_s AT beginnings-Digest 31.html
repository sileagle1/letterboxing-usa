<br/>
Mark here. I dropped Ryan off at the starting point of the Applachian Trail <br/>
today. He's on his way as you read this. Wish our friend luck! He wanted me <br/>
to let you know that you can read his beginning to this adventure at the <br/>
following link:<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/CentralAmerica/vol31.html<br/>
<br/>
I know most on the list have known Ryan was heading on out to the trail, <br/>
but the adventure has now started. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck Ryan!<br/>

included in his hilarious story but it sent me to the Pocketmail <br/>
website.  I couldn't find anywhere on the site to link into his <br/>
address.  I wanted to drop him some well wishes and see if he needed <br/>
any supplies when he passes through MD later this year.  (pretty <br/>
damn exciting, huh?)  <br/>
<br/>
Plus I know Psychomommy would love to meet him and so would I.<br/>

phone every couple of days to touch base with everyone. Now, that is <br/>
a lot of extra hiking.  I love his spunk.:) I bet the guy will find <br/>
a Jack in the Box or Taco Bell and phone every couple of days, and <br/>
still finish his hike before September. <br/>
