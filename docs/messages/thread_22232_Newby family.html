The old addage is true.  If at first you don't succeed, try, try <br/>
again!  Keep on going.  I had a hard time finding some of my early <br/>
boxes, but I find most of them.  Sometimes missing boxes is part of <br/>
the risk.  It happens to all of us.  Enjoy the adventure for what else <br/>
you gain--a nice hike, a day in a park, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that can be helpful is to email letterboxers in the <br/>
area.  I often keep track of many of the boxes around here so that I <br/>
can help other boxers along when they visit.  Where are you at?  <br/>
emailing placers or checking on regional lists can make a difference <br/>
sometimes.  The biggest thing though is to learn to enjoy all of the <br/>
aspects of letterboxing.  Find fun things about each place and it will <br/>
help when a box goes missing (oh and rehide them well so others aren't <br/>
missing for future finders :)<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the obsession.  You will love it.  Letterboxing is great <br/>
and, even though we are a crazy bunch sometimes, letterboxers are <br/>
pretty great too.  I have made some great friends here.<br/>

<br/>
What a bummer that the first box you went after was missing! Sometimes boxes<br/>
do go missing. They may be washed away by rain, or some noxer may discover<br/>
it by accident and steal it. Boxes are not usually buried, or if they are,<br/>
they are just put in a little hollow with leaves, rocks and sticks on top.<br/>
Be sure and let the placer know, so that the clues can be updated, and the<br/>
next boxer will know the box is gone. Sometimes placers will carve a new<br/>
stamp and replace the box. <br/>
<br/>
I usually have clues to 4 or 5 boxes in the area when we go, so that if one<br/>
or more are missing, we still come home with new stamps in our logs. <br/>
<br/>
If you don't mind advertising your location, you could also ask if anyone<br/>
has found boxes in your area recently. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>

Of course I knew there was a possibility we wouldn't find the box, <br/>
but try explaining that to little ones.  We live in Amarillo, TX.  <br/>
We were looking for Palo Duro Mouse...on up the trail there is <br/>
another LB, Lighthouse, but that was another 2 miles and I didn't <br/>
think the kiddos would make it. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I think we might jump in the car today and see if we can find <br/>
Armadillo Letterbox today.   I might not tell the kids what we are <br/>
doing until we actually find one.  The were SO disappointed.  I kept <br/>
praying that God would reveal the box if it were there, but no luck, <br/>
so it probably got washed away in a big rain we had awhile back or <br/>
was taken.<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering, do you "waterproof" your labels on the box?  I <br/>
can't remember if it was this group or the TX group that had samples <br/>
of labels, but waterproofing labels is very simple to do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

My favorite way to waterproof is using Clear Acrylic Sealer.  I would <br/>
print the labels and let them dry.  Then I would simply spray them <br/>
with the sealer.   I usually put two coats on.  Again, I don't know <br/>

better than nothing!<br/>

of 4 and then two singles. We struck out on the entire first series. My<br/>
friends, who had discovered letterboxing after I told them about it had<br/>
sneaked in a couple of trips before I had a chance to go out so they were<br/>
already hooked. I was determined not to give up so we went on to the other<br/>
group of 4. We found 3 of those and I was hopelessly addicted. The idea that<br/>
people had hidden these boxes all over, in places I'd already been. Knowing<br/>
I had walked right by a secret treasure, possibly numerous times without<br/>
knowing it was there was heady! <br/>
<br/>
If I had given up after not locating the first four, I would have missed out<br/>
on almost 2 years, 550 boxes found, 150 boxes hidden, lots of new friends,<br/>
and hundreds of trails I'd never seen! <br/>

Keep at it, give yourself a chance!<br/>
