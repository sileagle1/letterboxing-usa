The Clue Series in Richmond VA is based on the board game of the same <br/>
name.  There are 24 letterboxes divided between 4 parks.  <br/>
<br/>
One park has the weapons, another the rooms, and another the <br/>
suspects.  At the final park, you find out who did it, in what room, <br/>
with what weapon.  In order to find what park the final letterboxes <br/>
are at, you have to get clues from the last box of the first three <br/>
parks.  <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say this series is very unique with alot of good stamps <br/>
and was a lot of work.  Over a dozen people were involved in putting <br/>
this together.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I think the main person involved is not active in <br/>
letterboxing.  Several boxes have been reported missing and storms <br/>
over the past few years have altered some landmarks and paths.<br/>
<br/>
I've replaced two already but there are others to be replaced (up to <br/>
4 with the biggest park to check)  and one (maybe more) needing to be <br/>
moved.<br/>
<br/>
I would not mind taking care of this series but I would need to get <br/>
access to the directions to make alterations.  If anyone knows how to <br/>
get ahold of mlgainey please let me know.  If you were involved in <br/>
this series e-mail me at bobelehr at juno dot com.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what the web masters do in this situation.  Can I adopt <br/>
these boxes to make necessary changes or will letterboxers become <br/>
clueless to missing letterboxes, missing landmarks and changed trails?<br/>
<br/>
It would be a shame to let this great series fall apart but that is <br/>
what is happening.<br/>
