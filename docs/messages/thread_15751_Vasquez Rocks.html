&gt;When you went to vazquez rocks was there a mention of my F&amp;F hitchiker in<br/>
&gt;there,a fish stamp?Or did you pick it up,becuase thats where it was <br/>
&gt;dropped off<br/>
<br/>
There wasn't a hitchhiker in the box when I stamped in.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Was red rock canyon a Good Letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
It was a great location. There are a whole lot of unmarked trails in the <br/>
park, so it was tough to find the right starting point even with a map, and <br/>
I had a false start on the wrong trail, needed to backtrack and recount <br/>
paces a couple of times, and then tried a couple of different side trails <br/>
before I found the right hiding place at the end. The fact that the park is <br/>
a haven for rattlesnakes and mountain lions meant that I didn't want to <br/>
hang around too long by myself!<br/>
