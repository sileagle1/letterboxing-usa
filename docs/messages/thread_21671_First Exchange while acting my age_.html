I find when I'm not doing "business-to-make-a-living" that acting my <br/>
shoe size is much more fun than acting my age.  So last night as I was <br/>
in my front yard messin' in the mud &amp; water of my super birdbath-water- <br/>
feature (birds get mighty dirty while migrating), I heard some rustling <br/>
in the general direction of the only letterbox in Lucas County and <br/>
observed 3 brownies that were stampin in!  How exciting - I got out my <br/>
exchange stamp and we all exchanged.  They told me they would be back <br/>
to play another day as brownies aren't supposed to be out after dark - <br/>
but daylight savings time is just around the corner.<br/>
