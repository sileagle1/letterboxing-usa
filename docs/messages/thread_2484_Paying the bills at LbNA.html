    The website does cost something,  about $25.00 a month.  The costs<br/>
have been met through contributions by some of the earlier members.  All<br/>
the work has been done on a volunteer basis.  As our site and hobby have<br/>
grown, various people have contributed both time and money.  As the<br/>
years move on it is probable that there will be shortages of both Time<br/>
and Money so your Webmasters have been discussing ways of meeting needs.<br/>
<br/>
    Monetary contributions would be appreciated.  If you would like to<br/>
offer financial backing please email us at<br/>
LbNA-Webmasters@yahoogroups.com  When we figure out how to manage this,<br/>
we will gladly accept your participation!<br/>
<br/>
    Time = updated clues.  The best way for us to handle clues is to<br/>
link to clue pages on other servers but we do realize this is not<br/>
feasible for some people.  We are discussing ways to accept editing help<br/>
while minimizing server access (it would just get too complicated if a<br/>
lot of people could upload).  This would involve working on copies of<br/>
the pages and emailng them back to the person in charge of a specific<br/>
geographic area.  If you have skills in this area and would like to<br/>
offer some help, please email us at LbNA-Webmasters@yahoogroups.com<br/>

Speaking of this, how are the bills paid?  I assume the web site must<br/>
cost<br/>
something.  Is there a mechanism in place to accept donations to cover<br/>
these<br/>
costs?<br/>

Aren't there any alternatives?<br/>
<br/>
If memory serves me correctly, alternatives have presented themselves in the <br/>
past.  In fact, searching the archives, I found several offers to host and <br/>
manage the website for free.  For one such example, see<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/3363<br/>
<br/>
I don't know in any of these offers still stand, but even if they don't, <br/>
there may be others on this list who may have the skillset or the resources <br/>
to handle this, and who would be willing to come forth.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think it would most in keeping with the spirit of this list, if this <br/>
discourse was held on the list, rather than behind the scenes.<br/>

$20/month is a little excessive for a website.  Perhaps you may want to<br/>
consider looking at www.your-site.com.  The only charge $60/YEAR for<br/>

dues. A set amount, like $5 or $10. This way we can all give equally, <br/>
rather than 2 or 3 people paying an overly large amount. I'll bet a lot of <br/>
us would fire off a $5 or $10 check right away if given an address and a name.<br/>
