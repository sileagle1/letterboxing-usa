                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; You're on holiday at your mysterious great aunt Lady Silventine<br/>
&gt; Covington's country estate. She has been called away suddenly without<br/>
&gt; explanation and you have secretly snuck in to her study. Her walking<br/>
&gt; staff is leaning against the wall and the collection case is<br/>
&gt; overflowing with curiosities from Africa, Afganistan, Arizona. The<br/>
&gt; scent of old tobacco and fresh peppermint linger on the quiet air and<br/>
&gt; you spot her cluttered desk. There is an old volume, her regiment<br/>
&gt; patch from the Great War, a globe. You ease the door shut with a<br/>
&gt; click and tiptoe over to the book, lift its cover... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and just that moment a you hear a knock on the door. Your heart<br/>
&gt; thumping you return to the door and to your supprise your distant<br/>
&gt; cousin Major Nathaniel Peabody(USA, ret)is standing in front of you.<br/>
&gt; The Major is on a holiday and looking for adventure. He was passing<br/>
&gt; by Lady Silventine Covington's estate when he observed lights on.<br/>
&gt; The Major has in his possession a map he secured from an obscure<br/>
&gt; shop in Havanna. He asks you to join his quest......... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But 'ere you depart upon your treasure quest, you first must seek a<br/>
&gt; skeleton key that unlocks the drawer containing the code which<br/>
&gt; holdeth the true location of the treasure. Unfortunately, that<br/>
&gt; skeleton key was sent along its merry way with John Jacob Astor as<br/>
&gt; he returned from England to his beautiful home in the Pacific<br/>
&gt; Northwest. Needless to say, the key now lies buried either beneath<br/>
&gt; the waters of the frigid Atlantic or somewhere in Mr. Astor's<br/>
&gt; sprawling estate high atop the bluffs overlooking the mouth of the<br/>
&gt; Columbia River (or was that Maryhill???) My dear great aunt, Molly<br/>
&gt; M.C. Brown (may she forever rest in peace), always seemed to jumble<br/>
&gt; things up a bit. Now we'll never know the truth for it was upon her<br/>
&gt; death bed whence she painstakingly gasped out this last kernel of<br/>
&gt; knowledge... I wonder if that's the key to the drawer in Havana? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Never know the truth?" you think, "Bugger this, my curiosity is<br/>
&gt; piqued. If the key is lost or unattainable - much like Aunt Molly and<br/>
&gt; myself, (respectively), good sir - there is more than one way to open<br/>
&gt; a lock." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You reach for the heavy, metal, military-issue knife that your<br/>
&gt; eclectic great aunt uses as letter opener.  She leaves it sticking<br/>
&gt; upright in the wood of the desk - "Always keep your knife at hand"<br/>
&gt; Auntie said, "just in case....well, you know, for letters." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "With my brains and your brawn, Mr. Peabody?" You say, handing him<br/>
&gt; the knife and gesturing to the locked drawer. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Mr. Peabody looked at the knife for just a second. He pointed it<br/>
&gt; back at me. Startled, I jumped back. Just in time too, as he<br/>
&gt; brandished a pistol with the other hand.<br/>
&gt;   "What's this?" I exclamed.<br/>
&gt;    Mr. Peabody was always full of surprises. But this! This was very<br/>
&gt; unexpected. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  "I must know whether your intentions are for good or ill," Mr. Peabody <br/>
&gt; rasped.<br/>
&gt;  "Why, my intentions are the same as yours, surely you know that, my dear <br/>
&gt; cousin.  We haven't seen each other in years, but certainly you remember me <br/>
&gt; better than this," I squeaked, inching my way to the bookshelves behind me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;As I backed warily away from the brandished weapons, I stumbled over<br/>
&gt;my aunt's rheumy-eyed bloodhound. He squealed in pain, rose slowly from <br/>
&gt;the warm spot he'd claimed on the threadbare Bokhara carpet. As a deep <br/>
&gt;rumble sounded from his throat, my left hip brushed against a protruding <br/>
&gt;volume, The CompleteWorks of Milton. With a groan and a creak, the entire <br/>
&gt;bookshelf swung inward, exposing a lightless corridor.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Grabbing a bottle of sherry, for who knows how long this adventure might<br/>
&gt;take, I entered the dank corridor that lay ahead, armed with the sherry,<br/>
&gt;a lantern and my wits. While proceeding down the corridor, I noticed<br/>
&gt;that the walls were imprinted with the most oddly shaped characters <br/>
&gt;- almost a pictogram. As I held my lantern to the closest wall . . . <br/>
<br/>
The symbols produced the most odd sensation.  Somewhere deep in my mind, remnants.. tattered memories.. familiar yet foreign, otherworldly almost ancient... "How could that be?" I whispered. "I knew nothing of this place before..." Footsteps! It must be Peabody... "I must get away..."<br/>

"I must get away..."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"must get...must..." <br/>
<br/>
The first thing I recalled was the smell of peppermint and lavender.<br/>
Great Aunt Lady Silventine Covington was leaning over me with a<br/>
worried expression. "Darling boy, You really should stay out of her<br/>
Ladyship's study. We have told you time and again that you are not<br/>
permitted into our study when her Ladyship is not present. Her<br/>
Ladyship has a colorful past and many dangers and secrets lurk in the<br/>
shadows of the study." Between the royal we's and the light glinting<br/>
in my eyes from the Covington diadem that was perpetually perched in<br/>
her lavander scented coifure, I felt the room begining to spin again.<br/>
"Snap out of it" she demanded as I felt the sting of her kid glove on<br/>
my tender cheek "Silly boy, those weren't enchanted runes on the wall.<br/>
That decanter of sherry you grabbed (and we'll have a little talk<br/>
about that later)was for the Major, her Ladyship's special sleepytime<br/>
blend. You were raised better than that, the good sherry is always in<br/>
the Bacarat decanter, why on earth would one reach for the cheap glass<br/>
decanter?" She reached into her handbag and tossed me a bag of<br/>
peppermint lozenges, "These will help" she seemed to think peppermint<br/>
lozenges would cure anything. "Buck up now, we really must get back to<br/>
the study and see if the Major has fallen into our little trap or<br/>
wether you've made a mess of everything"<br/>

leather coffee table (the one that Lady Covington brought back with <br/>

found a silver tray full of brightly colored ribbon candy.  Adjacent <br/>
the tray, lay a sextant, a binocular and a small globe.  "That's <br/>
odd.  Why is it that a sewing pin is inserted into Dartmoor?"  Then, <br/>
they spied an old worn leather journal lying on the chaise lounge.  <br/>
One of its musty-smelling pages was dog-eared.  They quickly turned <br/>
to the page which revealed a hand scribbled name, James Cranmere, <br/>
and an postal address of some sort.  Unfortunately, a stain (I <br/>

the entry.  "Oh, but what's this I see on the next page? Why, it's <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The first thing I recalled was the smell of peppermint and <br/>
&gt; &gt; lavender.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Great Aunt Lady Silventine Covington was leaning over me with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; worried expression. "Darling boy, You really should stay out <br/>
of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ladyship's study. We have told you time and again that you are <br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; permitted into our study when her Ladyship is not present. Her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Ladyship has a colorful past and many dangers and secrets lurk <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shadows of the study." Between the royal we's and the light <br/>
&gt; &gt; glinting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in my eyes from the Covington diadem that was perpetually <br/>
perched <br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her lavander scented coifure, I felt the room begining to spin <br/>
&gt; &gt; again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Snap out of it" she demanded as I felt the sting of her kid <br/>
glove <br/>
&gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my tender cheek "Silly boy, those weren't enchanted runes on <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; wall.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; That decanter of sherry you grabbed (and we'll have a little <br/>
talk<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about that later)was for the Major, her Ladyship's special <br/>
&gt; &gt; sleepytime<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blend. You were raised better than that, the good sherry is <br/>
always <br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the Bacarat decanter, why on earth would one reach for the <br/>
cheap <br/>
&gt; &gt; glass<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; decanter?" She reached into her handbag and tossed me a bag of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; peppermint lozenges, "These will help" she seemed to think <br/>
&gt; &gt; peppermint<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lozenges would cure anything. "Buck up now, we really must get <br/>
&gt; &gt; back to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the study and see if the Major has fallen into our little trap <br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wether you've made a mess of everything"<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; They ventured into the study and nestled atop the inlaid wood <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; leather coffee table (the one that Lady Covington brought back <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; &gt; her from her trip to Morocco around the turn of the century) <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; &gt; found a silver tray full of brightly colored ribbon candy.  <br/>
Adjacent <br/>
&gt; &gt; the tray, lay a sextant, a binocular and a small globe.  "That's <br/>
&gt; &gt; odd.  Why is it that a sewing pin is inserted into Dartmoor?"  <br/>
Then, <br/>
&gt; &gt; they spied an old worn leather journal lying on the chaise <br/>
lounge.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; One of its musty-smelling pages was dog-eared.  They quickly <br/>
turned <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the page which revealed a hand scribbled name, James <br/>
Cranmere, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and an postal address of some sort.  Unfortunately, a stain (I <br/>
&gt; &gt; presume from Lady's favorite Baccarat goblet) covered the rest <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; the entry.  "Oh, but what's this I see on the next page? Why, <br/>
it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; a..."  and then the walls started to spin again, the floor <br/>
became <br/>
&gt; &gt; the ceiling, the ceiling became the floor. An aroma of ether <br/>
filled <br/>
&gt; &gt; the room and all turned black...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I found five dollars.  Stunned by the windfall, overwhelmed <br/>
with desire, I fell into a pounding silence.  Flashing images, <br/>
pungent aromas, catchy jingles seething through fevered brain...two <br/>
all beef patties...finger licking good...a run for the border...or a <br/>
double R with Dale's equestrian friend...but, alas, the lure of the <br/>
paper crown won the day.  You really can't go wrong with the King.<br/>

But dear Mr Not The Rev,<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid you may have have sinned and quite possibly have fallen <br/>
short of the glory of the fast food arena--how can you possibly <br/>
resist the 'on-the-spot' peeled, sliced and french fried potatoes <br/>
from In N Out Burger???  And then a burger capped with 'animal <br/>
style' onions?  They're quite worthy of the paper crown, in my <br/>
humble opinion.  ;)  And all this time folks thought we'd drive the <br/>
570 miles one way to Redding, CA just for some letterboxes, when it <br/>
actually was the lure of the nearest In N Out Burger that was the <br/>
greatest attraction...  We're exceptionally bummed that the <br/>
letterbox in the Bay Area In N Out Burger went missing.  Talk about <br/>
heaven &amp; earth combined!!!  Now, back to the regular installment <br/>
of "Nobody Home".<br/>
