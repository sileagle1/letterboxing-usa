                    <div class="plaintext-content">The last Sunday of October my Cadette Senior Girl Scout Troop <br/>
attended a Camporee near Fincastle, Virginia.  My troop laid a <br/>
letterbox trail for the weekend as an extra time activity.  We had a <br/>
lot of fun and hope those who tried it out did also.  On the way home <br/>
we stopped at the Peaks of Otter and enjoyed the hunt for the boxes <br/>
there( even the mist and rain didn't deter us).  They were well done <br/>
and the stamps superb.  Now to find out about that plane.  Thanks for <br/>
the effort to the owner.<br/>
