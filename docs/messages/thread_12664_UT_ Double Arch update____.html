a box at Arches NP that I didn't want the park service to find out <br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
However, they did find out about it and confiscated it.  Sad, I know, <br/>
but Arches National Park no longer has any letterboxes.  (There used <br/>
to be another one there, but the e-mail I got implied that that one <br/>
was confiscated as well.)<br/>
<br/>
And please don't bang the employees of national parks--they're just <br/>
doing their job!<br/>
