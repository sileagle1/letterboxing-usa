as I have been down sick. Worked last week in  the High school  and <br/>
picked up a cold I missed lots of great boxing weather I  have <br/>
several to get to and some to get out.  Hopefully the upcomiong week <br/>
will be productive. <br/>
   Look for the return of Lebanon green dry and clean , Black Coffee <br/>
on campus and  my Wings series which has waited a year  for our new <br/>
Mt. Hope Park to open. Leader of the Pack <br/>
