Weedon Island Preserve, St. Petersburg, Florida<br/>
<br/>
Weedon Island is located on Tampa Bay in Pinellas County. The <br/>
entrance of the Preserve can be found on the west side of the Gandy <br/>
Bridge (SR 92). Turn south on San Martin Blvd. Travel approximately <br/>
one mile and then east on Weedon Drive NE. A canoe ramp, fishing pier <br/>
and public restroom is at the end of Weedon Drive. <br/>
<br/>
Access to Weedon Island is limited to less than 300 people at a time <br/>
and may controlled by a gate. Hours are 8am to 6pm daily. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Start at the Paul Getting Memorial Trail (boardwalk). There is <br/>
parking here. You will want to take the Bay Trail.  To do this, you <br/>
will take a left just before the Tower Trail where there is a large <br/>
wooden sign detailing the trails.<br/>
You will pass many informational signs for the Cabbage Palm, the <br/>
Black Racer and Flatwoods.  You will also pass the boardwalk for the <br/>
Bay Trail on your right.<br/>
When you reach the sign for the Live Oak, you are very close.  Take <br/>
approximately 63 more steps along the trail.  On your left will be a <br/>
tall palm tree (12 to 14 feet high).  Ten paces beyond the palm off <br/>
the trail is a tall live oak tree.  At the base of this tree is the <br/>
Let's Go Sailing Letterbox covered with twigs and palm fronds. Please<br/>
be discreet.  A picnic area is just ahead on the trail and this area <br/>
can be very busy.  You can even take the box to a picnic table to <br/>
stamp in.  I also recommend wearing insect repellent.  I did not and <br/>
I regretted it!<br/>
<br/>
Please read the waiver of responsibility.  There are many creepy <br/>
crawlies in Florida!  :-)<br/>
