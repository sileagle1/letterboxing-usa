stop by some missed boxes in far flung venues.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to report that "Candle in the Wind" , North of Everett appears <br/>
to have gone.  I checked the three Thuja and some of the Pseudothuja <br/>
and it was not to be found.<br/>
<br/>
Nearby Road Trippin is doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
I also revisited Ft Steilacoom.  In town Byrd Mill Rd and Pioneer <br/>
Park are doing well.  Up at Ft Steilacoom Park I got the last 4 of <br/>
the Quest Fest boxes, the late arriving 4 Clowns.  Happy to report <br/>
all are doing well each in his unique box with unique books.<br/>

(Cougar series &amp; Mitten/Discovery Ship).  Minus the little snowflake <br/>
that unfortunately 'melted' oh so long ago.  :(  If you missed the <br/>
Fall leaves changing this year, I recommend that you run out to this <br/>
park ASAP--you'll be knee deep in maple leaves that are bigger than <br/>
Stuttgart (which is pretty big--I graduated from high school near <br/>
there)!!!  ;)  <br/>
