                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was fabulous!  Thanks again to Tempus Fugit &amp; the Doubtful Guests--what a great party it was.  I enjoyed meeting all of you &amp; the boxes were wonderful (even if I didn't get a chance to finish all of them--I may have to come back on Saturday....)  By the way, did anyone happen to see a Velamints tin with a couple sig stamps &amp; a traveller in it???  If so please contact me off list.  And whoever's pasta salad that was in the cooler--what a pleasant surprise! it was delicious :)<br/>
