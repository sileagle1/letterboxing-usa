The first box for the Christmas Around the World was soaking wet.  Team Green Dragon replaced the bag for it (must have just missed them on the trail).  Then we went over to Morey Rd. for Fairy of the Falls.  This trail was the most beautiful, with the water coming down the rocks.  It's worth going again if it was dried up during the summer just to see the water flow(seen a nice fox there also).  Headed to Mansfield to do a couple of quick ones...  Ponde Place and Ye Olde Cemetry(were we seen a pheasent)  Stop at the Mansfield General Store and had a great Chocolate Shake and Mansfield Special.  All in all a great day with holiday shopping and wrapping to boot.  I wish everyone a Merry CHRISTmas.<br/>
God Bless<br/>
