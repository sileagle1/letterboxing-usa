                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Mom and Dad are taking us to Maui next month. Yes! Nine days of <br/>
swimming! BUT, My Mom wants to hunt for the King's Highway letterbox.<br/>
I just hate to walk and the idea of hiking over lava beds...well that <br/>
is for silly kings that wish to collect money. I just want to swim.<br/>
<br/>
Is the hike a very long one? You mention that it will take 2 hours. <br/>
Are you a fast hiker or a slow one? I am only age 5 and have short <br/>
legs. Are there places to stop and go swimming? Should I bring my <br/>
snorkels and lunch? (my sister wanted me to asked you that question.)<br/>
Dad wants to know if he can get a margarita? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I will get lucky and Mom will forget to bring the info. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

P.S. We saw in the Byxbee box #2 log what your stamp looks like. Cool!<br/>
