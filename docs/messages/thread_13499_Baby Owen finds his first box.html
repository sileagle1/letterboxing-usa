decided on Sunday to find the van Gogh letterbox in Seneca Creek <br/>
State Park in Gaithersburg, MD.  True to form, he slept through the <br/>
entire hike while Mama and Dad Frog mucked their way through a whole <br/>
lot of mud (figures he'd pick a trail adjacent to a stream after all <br/>
the rain - the kid has a sense of humor, I tell you.)  But despite <br/>
the slick and gooey trail, the Forest Frog parents were really <br/>
excited to get out again after so many months of waiting.  Big <br/>
Brother Frog was at a picnic with grandpa that day, but that's just <br/>
as well, since he might not have done so well with the mud.  Thanks <br/>
to Donna and Chuck for a fun hike!<br/>
