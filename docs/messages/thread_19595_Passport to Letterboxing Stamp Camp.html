<br/>
When: August 27-29, 2004<br/>
Where: Battle Ground Lake State Park, Battle Ground, WA.<br/>
<br/>
   Come out and spend a weekend camping or come for the day on <br/>
Saturday. There will be workshops on Letterboxing 101, Stamp <br/>
Carving, Book Binding, Jr. Ranger Program and Camp Crafts for the <br/>
kids as well as 18 letterboxes in the area to find! Visit <br/>
http://www.parks.wa.gov for information on campsites, directions to <br/>
the park and other things that the park has to offer while you are <br/>
there. <br/>
   Each person attending will be given a Passport that will include <br/>
pages for your personal stamp and information, a map of the park, <br/>
maps to surrounding areas that have letterboxes, clues to <br/>
letterboxes in Battle Ground Lake Park only (you will need to bring <br/>
the clues for letterboxes at Lewisville Park and Yacolt if you plan <br/>
on searching for them while at the Stamp Camp), a complete schedule <br/>
of events and pages for the images of the MANY event stamps and <br/>
letterboxes that you will find at the park. This passport will also <br/>
make a great keepsake after the event.<br/>
   There will be some awesome letterbox items raffled off at the <br/>
event. Raffle tickets are $1.00 each or 6 for $5.00. Kid's raffle <br/>
will be free.<br/>
   When you arrive, everyone including the kids will need to "check <br/>
in" at the Passport to Letterboxing Stamp Camp check in table <br/>
located at campsite # 14 to receive your passport and information <br/>
about the event. <br/>
   Please bring your carving tools if you have them, Starter Kits <br/>
will be available for $5.00 each if you would like to purchase them <br/>
at the event, a hitch hiker if you would like to participate in the <br/>
Hitch Hiker Hostel hidden in the park, your own firewood if you will <br/>
be camping (the park does not provide firewood), your own meals <br/>
since this will not be a potluck event, your letterboxing supplies <br/>
and plenty of cash for the raffles and the day use fee of $5.00 if <br/>
you are not camping out. Please do not bring extra letterboxes or <br/>
hitch hikers to leave on the tables. <br/>
   Your hosts for this event will be Camp Fire Lady, Iron Bear and <br/>
Pandora, Maiden and Bookworm.<br/>
   Look for the red, blue and green balloons that will direct into <br/>
the park from the I-5 freeway and we will see you there at the <br/>
Passport To Letterboxing Stamp Camp at Battle Ground Lake State <br/>
Park, Battle Ground, WA.<br/>
