You may take a Hitchhiker (HH) if you leave a HH. <br/>
There will always be the host box stamp. <br/>

Come to the fair town of Mansfield in Eastern Connecticut. Here you will<br/>
find a multitude of letterboxes to suit every taste. The Inn of Winter is<br/>
placed where on a full moon night you would hear a wolf howl. From the trail<br/>
head by the sign of Joshua head toward the howl. Pass through two houses by<br/>
the trail and over a stone wall the border to the Wolf woods. On a pleasant<br/>
walk you come to a stair to avoid the trail eroding climb here and watch<br/>
your step. As you reach the top look on the right of the trail for a ship<br/>
shaped large rock. From the trail beside the rock take a reading of 170<br/>
degrees and go off trail to two other large rocks (not as big as the first)<br/>
nestled under the left rock in a bed of leaves and sticks is The Inn of<br/>
Winter. Enjoy the box and its host stamp, then swap HH. Make sure each is<br/>
stamped into the host book and your stamp as well. So much to do! Then<br/>
rehide as found . Be discreet this is a busy trail.<br/>
