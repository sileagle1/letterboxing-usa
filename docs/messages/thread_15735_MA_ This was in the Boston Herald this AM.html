Huge cat sighted on North Shore <br/>

Manchester-by-the-Sea police are advising people to stay away from <br/>
the woods after a string of sightings of a large wildcat some believe <br/>
to be a mountain lion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At least three people have reported sightings to the police, mostly <br/>
in the vicinity of Powder House Hill Reservation. Similar sightings <br/>
have been reported in Beverly in recent weeks.<br/>
<br/>
``We've had reports of foxes and coyotes,'' police dispatcher Dave <br/>
Metrano said yesterday, ``but never a lion - not in the 32 years I've <br/>
been here.''<br/>
<br/>
Animal Control Officer Rob Steach inspected the area with an expert, <br/>
who found tracks, droppings and fur consistent with a large cat, <br/>
police Chief Ronald Ramos said.<br/>
<br/>
Although authorities have yet to positively identify the animal, <br/>
Ramos said, ``we're working under the assumption that it may be a <br/>
captive-bred animal that escaped.''<br/>
<br/>
The chief advised residents to remain calm, noting the department is <br/>
working with state Environmental Police to find and ``possibly <br/>
capture'' the cat.<br/>
