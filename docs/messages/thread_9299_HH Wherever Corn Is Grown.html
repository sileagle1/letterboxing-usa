<br/>
I found Wherever Corn is Grown Hitch Hiker last week at the Lost <br/>
Fisher in Winton Woods, Ohio.  When I was stamping in my book I was <br/>
trying to figure out what corn had to do with the Lost Fisher.  I <br/>
eventually realized that it was a hitchhiker and raced back to the <br/>
tree to find the tiny microbox of a film container.  =-)  Almost <br/>
missed that one.  <br/>
<br/>
What fun pins.  Just wanting to let you know all is well with your <br/>
hitch hiker.  =-)  <br/>
