be donated to the Smithsonian. :)<br/>

Just prior to Martha going to her cinder block bungalow there were <br/>
several Martha stamps floating around. The image on ebay "K Martha" <br/>
was one as well as "Free Martha".<br/>
I certainly have no connection with the one on ebay, but if someone <br/>
would like to pay $37.00 for another duplicate then I 'll include <br/>
shipping. Boy, PT Barnum was right.<br/>

How or why it got on eBay I have no idea, but it seems perhaps (from<br/>
the questions listed) that someone placed it inside a box placed on<br/>
NPS land that was confiscated.  It most certainly does not belong to<br/>
Martha Stuart -- and whoever pays for it is being duped.<br/>
<br/>
Alarming.  Very alarming.<br/>

doubt it).<br/>

a good thing.  But then again perhaps she's in need of some more $$$ <br/>
these days--her stock did take a dive after that Imclone scandal a <br/>

transaction offer a probation period?  Oh, it said no <br/>

 How or why it got on eBay I have no idea, but it seems perhaps (from<br/>
 the questions listed) that someone placed it inside a box placed on<br/>
 NPS land that was confiscated.  It most certainly does not belong to<br/>
 Martha Stuart -- and whoever pays for it is being duped.<br/>
<br/>
 Alarming.  Very alarming.<br/>

 (Unless, as I said, its a well-conceived letterboxing ruse, but I<br/>
 doubt it).<br/>

There has never been a clue for the KM stamp, one was never expected <br/>
to dance the secret dance or quote passages from the secret manuscript <br/>
to get it.  The KM stamp was originally a HH and later made the rounds <br/>
to events, where all attendees were allowed to stamp.<br/>
