(Windsor, CT)<br/>
<br/>
Planted:  June 3, 2002 by Rebecca, Debbie &amp; Tom<br/>
Boxes:  Two<br/>
Length:  Parking lot to letterbox, one mile loop<br/>
Difficulty:  Paved path, easy walking, biking or roller blading <br/>
Note:  Bring bug spray during warmer weather.  Also certain paths <br/>
flood during flood season.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Windsor Center River Trail is located just north of the Center and <br/>
right next to the historic district in Windsor, CT, on Palisado <br/>
Avenue (Rt 159).  The paved path runs along the Farmington River.  <br/>
There is a parking area right off Palisado Avenue, across the street <br/>
from Bart's (hot dog stand).<br/>
<br/>
Proceed from parking area to path's entrance.  Go left on path<br/>
toward <br/>
the Farmington River.  Once you reach the river, take a right toward <br/>
Mechanic Street.  Continue along the path enjoying the river (which <br/>
will stay on your left).  Under a  mile the path will curve and<br/>
go <br/>
up a slight incline.  Once you have reached the top, look to the <br/>
right for a tall tree which has lost all of its bark.  Its trunk is <br/>
very smooth.  Continue straight on path until you see a little ways <br/>
up, on your right, two separate trees tightly side-by-side with a <br/>
branch fallen in between and a vine hanging; there will be a large <br/>
fat log below.  Look behind this log to find "Keep on Rollin' <br/>
letterbox".  Stamp in and cover up tightly as this whole River<br/>
Trail <br/>
can flood during high water season.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the path crossing over a large iron bridge.  Cross <br/>
quietly, in warmer weather you can hear the bull frogs, which sound <br/>
like a banjo!  <br/>
<br/>
"Bully" letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Once over the bridge, take a short jaunt left and look for a dirt <br/>
path on your left; a pond will be on your right.  Go a little ways <br/>
down the dirt path (about 20 paces) until you see a 5-trunk tree on <br/>
your right.  Look inside for "Bully"!  He'll be sitting<br/>
upon his lily <br/>
pad.<br/>
<br/>
Back track towards Palisado Avenue path (.5 mile) back to the parking <br/>
area.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>
