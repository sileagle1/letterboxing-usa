Ditto on the Jolly G-Man's letterboxes re the repair and maintenance. Work<br/>
and family duties have severally limited my boxing time. I have received a<br/>
few emails notices that my logs are getting full and I too would appreciate<br/>
a boxer who finds a full logbook to put in a new one and mail me the full<br/>
book. I'll be more then happy to reimburse any boxer for the cost of mailing<br/>
me a full logbook. Just drop me an email off list for my home address.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Some of you know that I was just about the only one placing boxes  in<br/>
this area for some time and I had no idea what they should even look like<br/>
since there were only 2 to be found at the time. So my boxes are not the<br/>
best in the world and the notebooks were hand made and small. Then the Post<br/>
article came out and wow! Now the boxes are getting a lot of use and the<br/>
notebooks are filled up.  I have also recently moved to Harpers Ferry WV so<br/>
a lot of the boxes are 2 or more hours away from me. Sooooo I am asking that<br/>
those who look for twograysquirrels boxes take along a repair kit consiting<br/>
of a new notebook, dry baggies and a new box to help me out and each other.<br/>
Others that follow will appreciate it, I'm sure, and I will as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So many of you are hiding new boxes and I am finally getting a chance to<br/>
find some instead of just hiding them. So I am reluctant to go back to the<br/>
old boxes when there are new ones to find. So your help in box maintence is<br/>
again appreciated so the hider can be the hunter as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you all for playing.<br/>
&gt; May there be lots of nuts in your lives,<br/>
