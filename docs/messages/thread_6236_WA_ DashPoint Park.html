  I<br/>think it's pretty cool.  There are usually numerous peacocks roaming

  <br/><br/>Horsethief Lake Letterbox:<br/>Thrilled to report that this letterbox

  visitor, which was Funhog, way<br/>back when.  I'm sure glad she went and

  I've got to get one of those annual passes soon<br/>since I visit Washington 
  parks quite a bit.<br/><br/>Both Mary Hill and Horsethief Lake State Park are 
  open late spring to<br/>early fall only, for the most part.  At Mary Hill 
  you can park at the<br/>gate and walk down and get the letterbox when the 
  grounds are closed.<br/>This is not so for Horsethief Lake, however.  When 
  it is closed you<br/>cannot get in.  Period.  There are petroglyphs 
  there that must be<br/>protected and so that park is highly 
  secure.<br/><br/>Anyhow... these letterboxes are worth getting.  I'm not 
  trying to be<br/>conceited.  I just happen to love the stamps I carved for 
  them since<br/>they so depict the places they are at.  <br/><br/>Best

     I did the exact same thing.  We're relatively new to <br/>
letterboxing as well.  About a month and a half ago, we went up to <br/>
Deception Pass State Park for a few days.  We practically were <br/>
sitting upon 2 of the boxes there (Bowman Bay and South Beach) and <br/>
didn't know it until I came home, logged on to the site and learned <br/>
that they were up there.  Drats...  We'll just have to head back.  <br/>
What a fun experience though!  We're about to drop our own couple of <br/>
boxes soon.  I just have to figure out how to create some stamps in <br/>
a quick manner (with 2 little ones running around).  Hope to have <br/>
our couple of boxes out soon!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail!<br/>
