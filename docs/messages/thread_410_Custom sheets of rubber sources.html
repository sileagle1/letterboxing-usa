Owosso Graphic Arts:<br/>
This one has no prices listed, but do say that they accept<br/>
orders online and have a 24 hour turnaround. Magnesium plates.<br/>
This recent testimonial from a RS company owner (Aglaia)<br/>
 on an RS list:<br/>
 "...ship next day and have a pretty good quality. They are not<br/>
the cheapest. However, they also don't cause me headaches <br/>

Mount Rubbermore:<br/>
Other RS companies I am familiar with (Haika, Stamp Zia) use this<br/>
one, and also a person who has had sheets of rubber done for herself<br/>
and others cooperatively.<br/>
Here is a price list for one size they have listed on their site:<br/>
(About 2 weeks for delivery, or 5-7 business days for repeat orders,<br/>
also magnesium matrix)<br/>
Size: 9x6 (with 5/8" non-printing margins)<br/>
engraving - $50.00<br/>
matrix - $10.00<br/>
sheets 1-9     $5.50 each<br/>
sheets 10-24 $5.00 each<br/>
sheets 25+    $4.50 each<br/>

  This is a sheltered-workshop run by the Cerebral-Palsy<br/>
Association of San Diego. The first url goes to one of the<br/>
website pages of a polymer clay artists that uses and promotes<br/>
the use of this company by other artists. Her website also gives<br/>
an overview of the process.<br/>

<a href="http://www.san.rr.com/ucpsd/readystamps.htm">Ready Stamps</a> <br/>
<br/>
I called them yesterday to get information, since there<br/>
was conflicting information on these two sites. <br/>
(Both websites also say that you need a resale number to<br/>
order, but I asked Sarajane in an email, and she told me<br/>
that they don't ask for it when you order. I'm about to find out!)<br/>
This is the info they gave me:<br/>
The size of the plate is 9x7 (rigilon or magnesium?)<br/>
  (no mention of margins, but I'd leave at least 1/4")<br/>
The plate and matrix is $21.00, each sheet of rubber is $10.50,<br/>
and shipping and handling is $3.00<br/>
<br/>
Hoggie mentioned to me once that Melanie of Elements stamps<br/>
would be able to make sheets of rubber as well.<br/>
Melaniekrs@aol.com. I haven't inquired yet, though.<br/>
I wonder if some of the other companies we once listed that<br/>
offered prices for individual stamps would also make sheets?<br/>
