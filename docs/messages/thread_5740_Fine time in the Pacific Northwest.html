Just wanted to thank all those Pacific Northwest letterboxers <br/>
whose interesting plantings added so much to our recent trip out <br/>
there.  We found time for boxes by Amanda A, Amanda B, <br/>
Funhog, Mitch, Ryan, Gypsy, Mischief, Bill, Buckaroo and quite a <br/>
few others!  We really enjoyed the diversity out there in stamps, <br/>
logbooks, and even the types of containers used which ranged <br/>
all the way from the tupperware type common in the northeast to <br/>
video cassette cases and soap dishes!  We also found Time <br/>
Flies when your having fun and just don't seem to know where <br/>
the time went!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, guys, for all the fun!<br/>
<br/>
