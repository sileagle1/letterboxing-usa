LB (a truely great hand carved stamp for those in Oregon).<br/>
<br/>
The story goes...<br/>
<br/>
Grace's Hitchhiker was first placed somewhere in Oregon on July 6, <br/>
2002 in honor of our daughter who was born on July 4, 2001. It has a <br/>
Fourth of July theme.<br/>
<br/>
You will be able to track its progress here: <br/>

<br/>
-----end<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the red and blue markers included with this stamp did <br/>
not survive and shortly dried up after the find, however, we were <br/>
able to squeeze out just enough ink to display the theme as intended <br/>
in its new home.  <br/>
