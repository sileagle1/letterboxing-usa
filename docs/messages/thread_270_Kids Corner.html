                    <div class="plaintext-content">Deborah, hope to be able to add your pictures to the photo album soon.  I<br/>
think this will be a fun addition to Kids Corner.  I know my nephew ''Little<br/>
Foot'' was absolutely thrilled to see his picture on the website!!<br/>
<br/>
You are correct about our decision NOT to attempt to use Pooh to illustrate<br/>
our forthcoming letterbox instruction pages for Kids Corner.  You will notice<br/>
that I have not, however, erased the Pooh picture on the first page of the<br/>
Kids Corner section.  Since so many people agreed that Pooh and his<br/>
'expetitions' tied in so nicely with our hobby, for now I have left this<br/>
single picture in place.  In addition, I have referenced the Winnie the Pooh<br/>
book, and added some short exerpts from it.  I am open to other's opinions on<br/>
this matter, but it is my understanding that such minute exerpts and<br/>
references (especially when associated with a not-for-profit, educational<br/>
project such as this one) qualify as "fair use", as long as proper credit is<br/>
given.  From what I have read, the Pooh publishers are relatively accepting of<br/>
this type of usage.<br/>
<br/>
My plan, at this point, is to lead in with this Pooh reference, and then<br/>
illustrate the rest of the site with original art and/or photos of real kids<br/>
making letterboxes and hunting for them.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
''Der Mad Stamper''<br/>

&gt; I took a peek also at the Kid's Corner photo album!<br/>
&gt;  Very nicely done! (I would have sworn that you had<br/>
&gt;  black hair, Mitch! Go figure!)<br/>
&gt;  Soon as I _find_ those pictures I'll get 'em in.....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  On another Kid's Corner note, I think I know that we<br/>
&gt;  ultimately decided on copyright free clip or original art,<br/>
&gt;  but in case anyone (besides me) is interested, the new<br/>
&gt;  Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act of October<br/>
&gt;  1998 effectively quashes any notion of anyone using<br/>
&gt;  original Winnie the Pooh illustrations anytime soon.<br/>
&gt;    I had written once upon a time that the copyright <br/>
&gt;  was due to expire fairly soon, but the new law means <br/>
&gt;  that it won't expire until sometime in the year<br/>
&gt;  2021 or so....  Normally this wouldn't bother me so much,<br/>
&gt;  but Disney already gets a big bite of my buck.<br/>

<br/>
...and as Graham originally (and imaginatively) suggested, all kids who appear<br/>
in the photos that are published (in both the ''photo album'' and the<br/>
letterboxing ''instructions'') will be identified only by their<br/>
''letterboxing'' names, along with the name of their State, and their age (mad<br/>
stampers excluded).<br/>
<br/>
     Any other fantastic ideas, gang?  Your input will be greatly<br/>
appreciated!!<br/>
