<div align="center">THE MAY BASKET</div>
<div align="center">
<div align="center">Box 2 of 3 of "When I Was a Girl In 
  The Martin Box" By Orra Parker Phelps, an autobiography of a girl living in 
  Coventry, CT in the 1870's. </div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center"><span class="880423916-16082002">  From box 1 travel over the bridge 
  on Parker Bridge Rd towards Coventry. At the stop sign veer right onto Bunker 
  Hill. At the intersection on Bunker Hill and South Street you will see a 
  triangle with a tree in the middle. Park on the South Street 
  side.  </span></div>
<div align="center">  </div>
<div align="left">   <em>"Early one 
  evening in May, Father came from the barn where he'd been milking Dancer, the 
  Jersey cow. There was a grin on his face and a twinkle in his eye as he said 
  "Wouldn't be surprised if Orra got a May basket. Saw Leon Lord and Kirk Wallen 
  sneaking down the road; guess I'll surprise them."</em></div>
<div align="left"><em>    I was thrilled. 
  Never had I had a May basket. I begged Father not to do anything to the boys. 
  "Oh Daddy, don't drive 'em off. I do want a May basket so 
  bad."</em></div>
<div align="left"><em>    Daddy laughed, 
  "You'll get your basket, but I'll give 'em a scare."</em></div>
<div align="left"><em>    He went into 
  the little front hall that had a narrow window on each side of the door. 
  He sat down by one and motioned me to look out the other. Presently we saw the 
  two little boys creeping softly across the yard. They got to the door and 
  one stood with fist raised up to knock as soon as the other should 
  hang the basket on the doorknob. The fist never had a chance to fall, for the 
  moment the basket was hung Father gave a tremendous knock on the inside. How 
  those boys did scatter! Father opened the door and handed me a paper box 
  decorated with crimped streamers, it's handle a strip of cat stairs. There was 
  nothing in it but what it matter? I had a May basket I could tell the girls at 
  school about." </em></div>
<div align="left"> </div>
<div align="center">There is a knot in the tree that has 
  a piece of wood stuck in it. PLEASE WAIT UNTIL NO CARS ARE COMING to remove 
  and replace the box!!!!!!!! Remove the dead wood and find your May 
  basket. </div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center">Note: Look at the white farm house 
  on the corner. Note the two long windows on each side of the doors. You 
  can practically see those two boys "creeping softly across the yard" and young 
  Orra watching out the window.   </div>
