Here's the problem. I go out to check on a box I placed but it turns out I<br/>
can't remember where I PLACED it.. Do I get to count it as a FOUND box if I<br/>
have to use my clues to find it? I know this might seem to give an edge to<br/>
some of the older members but I still had to hunt it down.<br/>

F25P5 so take my opinion for what it's worth. I thought that the rule <br/>
simply goes that you can't count your own boxes as a find. Don't <br/>
believe that there are any but's to the rule.....Chuck Straub <br/>

If one can not remember that they placed a box, they can count it.  <br/>
If one can not remember where they placed it, they can't.  Memory is <br/>
a fleeting thing.<br/>
<br/>
And the quote from one of the Indiana Jones movies comes to <br/>
mind...  "Remember?  Of course not, I wrote it down so that I <br/>
wouldn't have to remember."<br/>

I've had to use my own clues to find my own boxes sometimes, too.  Just<br/>
because we have bad memories that doesn't mean we can count old Placeds<br/>
as Finds.  HA! HA!<br/>
