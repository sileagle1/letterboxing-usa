As far as 2nd graders are concerned, I'd say the first two, possibly three would be accessible in a reasonable time. All 4 are spread over a 5 mile trail.  I've taken my 4 boys with me a couple of times there, ages 9, 8, 7 &amp; 1.  The 1st 2 boxes are within the first 2 miles of the trailhead.<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] VA - Williamsburg Area<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  We are going on a class fieldtrip to Williamsburg.  It seems that a lot of <br/>
  the boxes listed for that area (two out of the lonely three we found on the <br/>
  list) are noted as MIA.<br/>
<br/>
  Does anyone know if there are any existing boxes in the area?  We would love <br/>
  to look for them.<br/>
<br/>
  This would also be a terrific opportunity to introduce a VA 2nd grade class <br/>
  to the wonders of letterboxing!...  Thanks!  BeMa<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Be Ma - Karen and I were in Williamsburg this past weekend (May 10-<br/>
11) and stopped by two parks in the area.  What we found:<br/>
<br/>
At York River State Park in Croaker (about 10 miles north of <br/>
Williamsburg): The York River (Cardinals Rule and Pupa) and <br/>
Taskinas Creek boxes were all found in good shape. <br/>
Mattponi Trail LB seemed MIA.<br/>
<br/>
At 1st Landing/Seashore State Park in Virginia Beach: Fox Run, Long <br/>
Creek Seahorse, and the Witch of Agnesi were all found in good <br/>
shape. Ovals of Cassini, Hot Spot, and Broad Bay Shells seemed to be <br/>
MIA.  By the way, this is a HUGE park, with lots of different <br/>
environments (beaches, hilly stretches, pine forests, swamps with <br/>
Spanish moss, etc.).  <br/>
<br/>
We saw quite a few snakes at both parks, so watch where you put your <br/>
hands.  I was looking under a log in 1st Landing, and didn't notice <br/>
until I had moved that a copperhead was coiled up in the leaves about <br/>
6 inches from where my hand had been.<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you take lots of bug spray - the mosquitoes were out in <br/>
force.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.  <br/>
<br/>
  Kim and Karen<br/>
