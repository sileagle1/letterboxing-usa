Orca on April 13, 2001 at William L. Finley National Wildlife Refuge in<br/>
Benton County, South of Corvallis, Oregon.  This area is open from April<br/>
to November.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From the city of Corvallis, head South on Hwy 99W.  At<br/>
about milepost 93 take a right on Finley Road.  Head down this road (no<br/>
that's not a real coyote in the field on the  left-hand side - get your<br/>
binocs out and you'll see) till you get to the entrance for the William<br/>
L. Finley Wildlife Refuge and turn left there.  Follow the road a ways,<br/>
past viewpoints, buildings and barns till you see the sign for the<br/>
Woodpecker Loop Trail.  Make a right there, drive up and park at the<br/>
trailhead.  <br/>
<br/>
DIFFICULTY:  Incredibly easy.  It may even be handicap-accessible.  The<br/>
trail is mostly gravel and wooden boardwalks and is quite wide.  The<br/>
hike itself is only a one-mile loop.  Very pretty little hike, though,<br/>
and certainly well worth it.<br/>
<br/>
--- WARNING --- WARNING --- WARNING ---<br/>
Poison oak positively FLOURISHES off the trail in this beautiful and<br/>
amazing place.  YOU ARE SAFE WHERE THE LETTERBOX IS AND IF YOU STAY ON<br/>
THE TRAIL.  If nature calls, however, be careful. Women will need to be<br/>
VERY MINDFUL of where they squat and even guys need to be aware because<br/>
the stuff GROWS TALL here.  My advice is to use the  designated restroom<br/>
in the building/barn area ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Park at the trailhead and go on the trail.  Turn right and over<br/>
the bridge.  You will go through a forest, then out into a clearing.<br/>
Approach the large, corraled oak tree and go onto the walk.  Read the<br/>
signs to learn about cool birds and to see a photo of  poison oak so you<br/>
can identify it later.  After viewing the signs, stop in the middle for<br/>
an incredible Willamette Valley view.  Go around to the end of this<br/>
wooden horseshoe.  At the end of the Northside of the boardwalk between<br/>
the 4th and 5th plank a hairy woodpecker resides waiting for your stamp<br/>
in the Woodpecker Trail Letterbox.  Please make sure the box is replaced<br/>
and well-hidden so it cannot be seen between the slats.<br/>
<br/>
