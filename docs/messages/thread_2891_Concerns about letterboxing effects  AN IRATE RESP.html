&gt; You think I'm wrong ? Flame Away !<br/>
<br/>
I do, and I will. :-)  Flaming the powers that be is most likely a<br/>
low percentage strategy in the end, regardless of anything else.<br/>
I do, however, believe there are reasons to take notice of what <br/>
several land managers have said about geocaching (and by association,<br/>
letterboxing), as it has been banned now in several jurisdictions.<br/>
I had composed my thoughts in another message, which I will post<br/>
following ...<br/>
<br/>
Quoting Eric Mings:<br/>
&gt; I find myself wondering why there was no reference to orienteering. <br/>
<br/>
Orienteering clubs always get written permission from the landowner <br/>
or manager before conducting meets.  Orienteering organizations hold<br/>
insurance policies to protect the landowner.  Orienteering clubs know<br/>
they are not conducting their activities in an environmentally sensitive<br/>
area because they have asked the park first.  (We had one case where <br/>
the park said we could not use a particular field.  Did not look <br/>
environmentally sensitive, but the park, not us as orienteers,<br/>
geocachers, or letterboxers, is the only one who knows for sure).<br/>
<br/>
Those who do not understand sport orienteering and how it is organized, <br/>
but wish to, e-mail me off-list :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Responsible recreating in public and private lands is an individual<br/>
&gt; responsibility whether you are hiking, mountain biking, orienteering,<br/>
&gt; hunting, fishing, letterboxing, geocaching, stonestashing, or <br/>
&gt; just out for a walk.<br/>
<br/>
Again, all of the activities above, except "letterboxing, geocaching, <br/>
stonestashing", require some sort of permitting, licensing, or following<br/>
local signage or rules.  (Why should I need a license to go fishing,<br/>
I could reasonably ask (and I reasonably do ask this, without being<br/>
facetious).  But that is the way it is, at least where I live.  When<br/>
I go fishing, I bring my license).  In some places you need a license<br/>
to gather mushrooms.<br/>
<br/>
This debate has come up many times on the various geocaching fora.<br/>
Not to disparage anyone here, but I imagine the debate will run along<br/>
the same lines as it did there (q.v. the [gpsstash] list archives for <br/>
further reading); i.e.  we're not littering, we're environmentally <br/>
reasonable people, we're bringing in visitors so this helps the park, <br/>
are we really worse than hunters?, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line comes in two points.  First, the land manager will <br/>
decide what is and what is not littering, as will the general <br/>
public (as once you place a geocache/letterbox, it is the <br/>
world-at-large's to do with it as they please).  Convince the <br/>
general public that you are not littering.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, someone on the geocaching list brought up the example of<br/>
some form of aviation (I believe hang gliding but I cannot remember<br/>
exactly).  They said their history was the same, people basically <br/>
didn't want them to do it, for the usual various and sundry reasons<br/>
which all boil down to the same core as they do here.  Bottom line<br/>
is that they had to form an organization to "legitimize" themselves<br/>
and do the necessary PR with the various powers that be, to demonstrate<br/>
and educate how what they were doing was acceptable.  Most outdoor <br/>
activities has had to do this in one form or another, or at least find<br/>
a way to work with the powers that be up front, I (in the minority <br/>
perhaps) believe geocaching/letterboxing will have to (and indeed <br/>
should) follow suit someday.  <br/>
<br/>

Always up for a good debate ;-) My point about orienteering is that <br/>
regardless of whether permission is given, you have a bunch of people <br/>
trampling the fastest path they can find to get to a checkpoint (or <br/>
whatever it is called in the sport). It really is irrelevant to my <br/>
points except that I thought it was strange that he only mentioned it <br/>
in a positive light in the context of all the supposed environmental <br/>
damage that could be wrought by letterboxers and geocachers.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Again, all of the activities above, except "letterboxing, geocaching,<br/>
&gt;stonestashing", require some sort of permitting, licensing, or following<br/>
&gt;local signage or rules.  (Why should I need a license to go fishing,<br/>
&gt;I could reasonably ask (and I reasonably do ask this, without being<br/>
&gt;facetious).  But that is the way it is, at least where I live.  When<br/>
&gt;I go fishing, I bring my license).  In some places you need a license<br/>
&gt;to gather mushrooms.<br/>
<br/>
Where I live you certainly don't need any permitting or licensing for <br/>
hiking or mountain biking unless you are camping in some areas that <br/>
require a permit for scheduling purposes. Down here licenses for <br/>
hunting (which I don't do) and fishing (which I do every chance I <br/>
get) are a source of revenue to help maintain the resources <br/>
themselves. One of the few taxes I have no dislike of paying. To me <br/>
letterboxing/geocaching/stonestashing is no different than hiking <br/>
apart from the issue of leaving something behind which I addressed <br/>
previously.<br/>
<br/>
I do think your point about land managers ultimately deciding which <br/>
activities they will allow is the way it is, like it or not. If <br/>
letterboxing is banned and you leave one on a piece of government <br/>
property you may be prosecuted if they can figure out who you are. <br/>
This discussion occurred a while ago regarding the National Park <br/>
Service and their statements about geocaching. I think they will be <br/>
hard pressed to prosecute someone for leaving a small stone in the <br/>
woods as I am proposing for StoneStashing, but who knows what can <br/>
happen. Could an organization legitimize any of these hobbies and <br/>
gain acceptance from various authorities? I don't know. I am <br/>
concerned that any man made containers with objects inside will <br/>
always be viewed as trash by authorities. Will images carved on a <br/>
small stone be likewise viewed as trash? I hope, not but who knows. <br/>
It may come down to the only variant they can't govern being <br/>
"PictureHunting" or something similar where only a photograph is <br/>
taken at the site of the find. I think something similar using GPS is <br/>
considered a virtual geocache.  And no.... I don't have the time or <br/>
inclination to try to get involved with developing that conceivable <br/>
variant :-)<br/>

not, the only way to legitimize this sport is to organize.  I think that<br/>
we will also have to enter into some sort of dialog with land use<br/>

officials among ourselves forever and we will never change official<br/>
attitudes or policies.  I am sure that the park service, undermanned as <br/>
they are, will enforce the rules and someone will get cited for<br/>
letterboxing.  The only alternative to a constructive dialog and<br/>
legitimization, as I see it is to go underground and off the web<br/>

&gt; Always up for a good debate ;-) My point about orienteering is that<br/>
&gt; regardless of whether permission is given, <br/>
<br/>
My point was that permission was given.  I don't think such a <br/>
"debate" holds promise, as we are talking different points.  I<br/>
believe my point trumps yours, FWIW ;-)  Arguing what activies<br/>
have impact, and which do not, is not the issue, IMO (BTW, many <br/>
studies have found that sport orienteering does not have impact, <br/>
FWIW).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Where I live you certainly don't need any permitting or licensing for<br/>
&gt; hiking or mountain biking <br/>
<br/>
Reread my post.  I also said "signage and local rules".  I've<br/>
had to disregard both to find many of the letterboxes that I<br/>
have found.  The most common is "no off-trail travel".  I've<br/>
heard of geocachers being warned by rangers and threatened with<br/>
citation about this.  I know first hand of someone who has the <br/>
attitude (quoting from memory) "no ranger is going to intimidate <br/>
me", but I think this is a poor, and potentially pathological,<br/>
attitude in the long run.<br/>
