That box where you have to cross over using the log--that box is <br/>
definitely missing.  I found it shortly after it was hidden so I knew <br/>
exactly where to look, and a later checkup on the box showed it as <br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>
As for the other one--it's hard to believe that one is missing <br/>
because it's VERY cleverly hid.  Even when you're looking in the <br/>
right place some people have reported trouble finding it (including <br/>
myself!).  If you're looking in the right place, be sure to to stick <br/>
your arm in that hole as far as it can possibly go, 'cause otherwise <br/>
you're gonna miss it.  If you've ever found the Multnomah Falls box <br/>
and how difficult it is find (even when you're looking in the right <br/>
spot!), this is much the same.  (Perhaps *slightly* easier, though, <br/>
since there are fewer holes that need checking!)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

&gt; I sent word to the webmaster--is that the correct protocol?<br/>
<br/>
Fascinating question.  Typically, you need comfirmation from someone<br/>
who "knows" the location of the box (typically the person who wrote the<br/>
clues).  Otherwise, posting to the list is best as it builds up a "fuzzy"<br/>
notion of whether the box is missing (all to often, people who report<br/>
boxes missing are wrong, therefore (IMHO), it is best to ignore these<br/>
reports unless there are tons of them without rebuttal).<br/>
<br/>
In this case, Ryan claims a position of ownership (w.r.t. to this <br/>
question), which typically would be fine (we all trust Ryan), but there <br/>
are wrinkles (which surely are not at work here), where this would not <br/>
be the case (forgetting the case of some newbie who claims to have found<br/>
it, then claims it is missing, just to be a jerk) -- there are at least <br/>
two boxes I could cause to "go missing", one created by someone else, <br/>
without me moving them nor changing their clues.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (I'm new to all this.)  <br/>
<br/>
You'll learn to ignore my ravings :-)<br/>
<br/>
But, if you like my ravings, you can join me on the group chat channel<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Thanks, Ryan.  I was sure I was in the right place with that box<br/>
&gt; where you cross over the log (it just HAD to be right!)<br/>
<br/>
You know, the first time I went out hunting for that box, I knew <br/>
without a doubt I was looking in the right place and it still took me <br/>
a half hour to find the darned box.  You have to be careful with Der <br/>
Mad Stamper--he's famous for hiding it in very tricky spots that even <br/>
if you're looking in the right place it's still difficult to find!  <br/>
When I went back later to check on it, I probably spent another half <br/>
hour thinking, "I know it's got to be here somewhere!!!" before <br/>
finally conceeding that it must be missing.  His Multnomah Falls box <br/>
is probably the most 'infamous' for its particularly difficult-to-<br/>
find location that NOBODY has ever found on their first outing out so <br/>
far as I know.  Most people take at least two or three attempts <br/>
before finding that box.  (I'm a quick learner--it only took me two <br/>
attempts.  *wink*)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But that second one...hmmm, how annoyed with myself I'll be if it<br/>
&gt; really WAS in that spilt tree after all.  I didn't stick my hand<br/>
&gt; way in, just had a look.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'd definitely go back and check that one again if you didn't <br/>
actually stick your hand in the hole.  You shouldn't be able to see <br/>
it just be looking in.  The hole is a lot deeper than it seems and <br/>
you'll have to stick your arm in at least up to your elbow if you're <br/>
going to have any hope of retrieving it.  Bring gloves--it makes it <br/>
MUCH easier.  I don't think I'd have gotten the box if I hadn't <br/>
brought gloves for such an 'emergency'!  It's creepy sticking your <br/>
whole arm into a hole you can't see into!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And I wasn't really sure I was in the <br/>
&gt; correct place--it was supposed to be a "grove of cedars" but I saw<br/>
&gt; only two...which I wouldn't call a grove...<br/>
<br/>
I didn't count the trees, but I seem to remember much more than two.  <br/>
It's been awhile since I've been there though, and just because the <br/>
box was there the last time I visited the site doesn't mean it still <br/>
is.  The box really could be missing.  Perhaps the tree was cut down <br/>
due to disease?  (You don't see lots of stumps where you think the <br/>
box might have been, do you?)  I'd love to check on it and assure you <br/>
it's there, but I'm kind of in California at the moment (just kind of-<br/>
-my heart will always be in Oregon *wink*) and it'll be a long while <br/>
before I'll get a chance to get back.  (Perhaps as late as next <br/>
winter!)<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of that tree, though, in case I never mentioned it before, I <br/>
had an amusing story regarding looking for that letterbox.  It was <br/>
only the fourth letterbox I had ever gone looking for so I was still <br/>
very much a newbie and after hunting down three other of Der Mad <br/>
Stamper's boxes, I wasn't going to leave without sticking my arm down <br/>
that hole and searching that cavity very thoroughly before calling it <br/>
quits.  And what was the first thing that I found?  A stash of porn!  <br/>
I felt it and thought, "Ah-ha!  I found the letterbox!"  Pulled out <br/>
the stuff and imagine my shock to discover a bunch of porn in my <br/>
hands.  Mostly cut out from magazines, although a couple of entire <br/>
pages were there as well.  It was badly decomposing.  And I started <br/>
thinking, is this a sick, twisted joke?  Is this from some kid that <br/>
didn't want his mother to find it in his bedroom?<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I packed it up and threw it away when I got back into <br/>
the vicinity of a trash can and chalked it up a 'war story' I could <br/>
talk about whenever I actually met some other boxers.  =)<br/>

<br/>
I agree, you should always get confirmation from someone who "knows" <br/>
the location of the box.  Even when you swear up and down you're <br/>
looking at the right place so it must be missing, it's too easy to <br/>
get it wrong.  Certain boxes even have bad habits as regularly being <br/>
reported missing but turns out, nope, they just missed the box.  And <br/>
if it's a newbie reporting the box missing, there's a VERY good <br/>
chance they're wrong.  The more experience someone has letterboxing, <br/>
the less of a chance they'll report false positives (or positive <br/>
faults as the case may be?)  You grow a sixth sense about where boxes <br/>
might be hidden and (even better) after finding several of a certain <br/>
person's boxes, you start getting a good idea of the types of <br/>
locations they might be more inclined to hide the box.  Consequently, <br/>
you're more likely to be successful and less likely to report boxes <br/>
that are missing or not.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In this case, Ryan claims a position of ownership<br/>
<br/>
Well, I wouldn't use the word 'ownership' since I never actually hid <br/>
the box.  Just claims to have found it before it had gone missing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; but there are wrinkles (which surely are not at work here)<br/>
<br/>
That's true, I could have a deep, secret hatred of Der Mad Stamper <br/>
and his frustrating clues and report some of his boxes are missing <br/>
even when they aren't.  If you trust me, you'll just assume I'm <br/>
an "expert" on the box and take my word at face value.  If you don't, <br/>
well, that's another story....  If you've ever watched the X-Files, <br/>
the motto "Trust no one" does have a certain element of truth to it.  <br/>
I'm probably not universally liked on this board, but as a whole I <br/>
think I'm generally considered trust-worthy if nothing else.  *wink*<br/>
<br/>
But even then, there have been known instances of some well-meaning <br/>
individuals deliberately MOVING a box for it's own well-being and <br/>
then not telling anyone about it for a long while.  I've even done <br/>
that once before at Sweet Springs Preserve when the box was in <br/>
absolutely plain view and upon checking the logbook discovered that <br/>
over 40 people had logged into it--and not a single one of them was a <br/>
letterboxer!  I immediately rehid the box in a different location <br/>
nearby and e-mailed the owner letting them know what I did.  That <br/>
particular clue was never published on the website, though (only a <br/>
word-of-mouth type of clue--don't for a second think the website is a <br/>
complete listing of all letterboxes!), and it never caused anyone to <br/>
report its premature dismise.  (Although, as it turns out, the box <br/>
has since ligitamately gone missing after a construction project went <br/>
through the area.)<br/>
<br/>
There's a letterbox at Arches National Park I was *THIS* tempted to <br/>
relocate because it was so far off the trail.  With signs and <br/>
warnings everywhere not to go off the trail because of "endangered <br/>
dirt" where a single footprint could cause decades of damage, it <br/>
seemed totally irresponsible to place it so far off the trail like it <br/>
was and frankly, it rather ticked me off that someone did so.  First <br/>
I was inclined not to go get the box in the first place, and even <br/>
after finding the box I was tempted to move it for the preservation <br/>
of the environment.  If the park service ever finds that letterbox, <br/>
there's no doubt it'll be gone in a heartbeat anyhow.  I guess the <br/>
ONLY reason I didn't move the box was because of the rain, thunder, <br/>
lightning, and hail that was bearing down and the thought it's so far <br/>
out of the way that few people ever go out to get it which limits the <br/>
damage that could be done.  I was too lazy to do it!  I don't take <br/>
moving someone else's box very lightly (a serious breech of <br/>
etiquette), but sometimes it would be almost criminal not to!  (I do <br/>
hope that somebody either steals the box or replaces it--it still <br/>
bugs on my conscious that I never did anything about it.)  In any <br/>
case, had I actually moved the box, there would have been a lag time <br/>
between when I actually moved it and the time it was reported as <br/>
moved, during which time several people might ligitamately claim the <br/>
box was 'missing' even though they were looking in the correct <br/>
location and perhaps had even found the box before!<br/>
<br/>
Other times people have inadvertantly carried out a box thinking it <br/>
was trash (which kind of gives me a goody-goody feeling inside that <br/>
so many people are willing to pick up other people's trash in the <br/>
woods for the benifit of all) before discovering it really wasn't <br/>
trash and putting it back a few weeks later.<br/>
<br/>
Which is all to say, I guess you can't really always be sure a box is <br/>
truly missing or not--even if you were the one who hid it!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow....  given all these uncertainties, it's totally <br/>
understandable why the webmasters wouldn't want to remove a box or <br/>
listing from the website without express permission from the person <br/>
who hid the box in the first place.  The best thing you can do if you <br/>
suspect a box is missing is to contact the owner and let them decide <br/>
if the box really is missing or not and, if it is missing, ask the <br/>
webmasters to remove the box from the website.<br/>
<br/>
I've gone on long enough.  Farewell!<br/>

Yeah, that Mr. Stamper guy is really good at finding devilishly <br/>
