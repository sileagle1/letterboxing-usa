&gt;I wonder if they were trying to get that letterbox there.<br/>
<br/>
While there is a box at Taughannock Falls (I'm the maintainer, though not <br/>
the planter), it's not near the area where she was killed, and there's no <br/>
threat from falling rocks where the box is planted. There are numerous <br/>
signs warning of danger from falling rocks along the gorge trail, and her <br/>
family had to pass - and ignore - multiple posted warnings not to go <br/>
off-trail in order to get to the area where they were hit by rocks. While <br/>
the pool beneath the falls they were exploring is a popular place for <br/>
illegal swimming, rock slides are fairly common and the park rangers often <br/>
patrol and ticket to keep people out. Amanda from Seattle, Ryan and I <br/>
witnessed a small one in June while we were down at the base of the falls <br/>
(but still on trail), and it happened quickly with absolutely no warning.<br/>
<br/>
It's a sad fact that people die or are seriously injured while hiking or <br/>
otherwise exploring the gorges in and around Ithaca on a far too frequent <br/>
basis. In almost every case, though, those involved were either off-trail <br/>
or in an area clearly marked as dangerous or off-limits. I've included <br/>
warnings about gorge safety in all of my boxes that require one, and I've <br/>
added a note about this death to the Taughannock Falls clues as well. I'm <br/>
considering pulling this box completely because it does ask finders to go <br/>
off-trail by entering the stream bed, although the danger of injury in this <br/>
particular area is very, very slight. I'm sure the original planters never <br/>
intended to put future finders at risk. They no longer live in the area, <br/>
though, so I'll make the decision to pull it or not myself.<br/>
<br/>
Please, if you choose to letterbox in the Finger Lakes of New York or any <br/>
place with signs warning to stay on trail, don't ignore them. They're there <br/>
for your safety, as well as the safety of those who will have to come <br/>
rescue you if you get into trouble. The rescue team in this case put their <br/>
own lives in jeopardy as the rocks continued to fall during the rescue.<br/>
<br/>
I always welcome questions from anyone interested in seeking any of the <br/>
gorge boxes in our local area. Please don't hesitate to ask if you want an <br/>
honest assessment of the risk involved. Our gorges are absolutely stunning <br/>
and well worth the hike, and most are very safe if you stay on trail. There <br/>
are a few I wouldn't recommend for children or less experienced hikers, <br/>
however, and I note that in my clues.<br/>
<br/>
Those interested in learning more about what went wrong here can read the <br/>
coverage in the Ithaca Journal. My heart goes out to Ms. Rowen's family and <br/>
her community and I sincerely hope that this is the type of story I never <br/>
have to read again.<br/>
