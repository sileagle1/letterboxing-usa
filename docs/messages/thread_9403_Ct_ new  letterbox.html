WINTER CAMPING IS FOR THE BIRDS<br/>
by The Group ~~ Angel - Bluebird - Butterfly - Slow Camel<br/>
and Lobsta Lady<br/>
The Story:<br/>
Winter shows its own beauty. The Campgrounds at Rocky Neck are<br/>
open for walking, hiking, biking, cross country skiing , snow shoeing<br/>
but not camping. Now is the time to enjoy a different side of Rocky<br/>
Neck. The Campgrounds are named for Shore Birds and we have<br/>
planted eight boxes . Some of these began as treasures for the Kids Day<br/>
Hunt. Three remain in place and two have flown in from their hiding<br/>
place to make new nests. They all live in the campground circle bearing<br/>
their name. A Green Heron and Owl have joined the flock. along with<br/>
the first box containing maps.<br/>
The Clues:<br/>
Come to Rocky Neck State Park in East Lyme CT., exit 72 off I 95.<br/>
Park at the main gate by the toll booth. There is room for about six<br/>
cars. Begin the hunt here. Proceed to the right on the campgrounds<br/>
road in a South Westerly direction. At the small camp office [closed for<br/>
the winter] --at the Map Board , stand and sight 30 degrees to a large<br/>
clump of our State Flower . A tall Oak tree is at the edge of the bushes<br/>
and you can not see it from here!! Begin to walk, count about 60 steps<br/>
[30 paces if you wish] to the Oak tree and The R.N.S.P. Camping<br/>
Letterbox planted by Butterfly. is resting behind the tree.<br/>
If you need a map of the campground area please take one. Then stamp<br/>
in and re hide the box well.<br/>
Now you can choose which camping area you wish to visit. The order of<br/>
the clues is not important.<br/>
<br/>
In the Crane Circle, Letterbox by Angel : The Crane is the object of this<br/>
search but feathers it will not be sporting. Listen closely for the sound<br/>
of hooves but dare not look at the rider. Follow his headless journey<br/>
and maybe you will be lucky and find his quest. Look for the camping<br/>
site #2 Do you see the maple tree close by ? Directly behind the tree<br/>
--due south take 25 steps [13 paces if you wish] into the woods. What<br/>
you seek is in a trilogy . Cover it back carefully<br/>
<br/>
In the Egret Circle Letterbox by Butterfly: The Egret has flown in<br/>
from the beach and found a lovely place for her nest. Find the camp site<br/>
#20. Notice the clump of birch trees between # 18 and #20 . At the<br/>
parking pavement for #18 go to the back -east corner . Notice two tall<br/>
Oak Trees . Egret has built her nest behind the right one of them . If<br/>
you find it and stamp in, be sure to hide it well again.<br/>
<br/>
In the Osprey Circle Letterbox by Bluebird, walk the wrong way down<br/>
the one-way circle to campsite number [100-95+10] Behind this<br/>
campsite find a field of boulders. Set your compass to 90+90 degrees to<br/>
find the biggest of the rocks ~~ go there. Look 300-30 degrees to see<br/>
the bookends and a split rock. Look in a tree hole for your treasure.<br/>
Please hide it back carefully.<br/>
<br/>
In the Heron Circle, Letterbox by Bluebird . You are lucky if you see<br/>
this beautiful Green Heron . She has flown in , joined the group and<br/>
quickly found a wonderful spot for her winter nest. Find Campsite # 22.<br/>
Begin walking 36 steps at 230 degrees to a four sister tree. See the<br/>
nest?? Its there. Stamp in and be careful to hide it well.<br/>
<br/>
In the Seagull Circle Letterbox by Lobsta Lady , wing your way past<br/>
Osprey area until you arrive at the sign for the Seagull circle. Bear<br/>
Right as the One Way sign indicates. and look for the Very First<br/>
Drinking Water Only sign at a water faucet. From that sign take a<br/>
bearing of 210 degrees and walk about 30 Paces down hill to the small<br/>
Cedar tree with vines entwined , growing next to a moderately sized tan<br/>
rock. Your treasure is hidden there. Stamp in and cover the treasure<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Lobsta Lady left her Kids Day Bonus The Cats Meow Letterbox and to<br/>
find it, continue your journey walking through the SEA GULL area<br/>
until you arrive at the campsite number 9. From that post, take a<br/>
bearing of 250 degrees and walk about 21 Paces to a four trunked<br/>
maple tree. Hidden in its arms is the treasure you seek. Be careful to<br/>
cover this treasure once again.<br/>
<br/>
The Owl by Slow Camel , has chosen to join us at the Amphitheater. If<br/>
you are as wise as she, you will find a path between the Seagull and<br/>
Osprey circles and find the amphitheater along the way. There are<br/>
more ways than one to find this spot. Once there, walk up onto the<br/>
stage ~~ sing a song, dance a dance or talk a speech !! Have fun. Then<br/>
notice if you look right, you will see three  points. If you look <br/>
left, you<br/>
will see four points. Left is right, and four is more. The wise Owl<br/>
know that. Please tuck her back well and cover her up. Place the trap<br/>
door back over the treasure. Thank you<br/>
<br/>
We hope you have enjoyed this winter Campgrounds jaunt.<br/>
The Way to your Car will be easy to remember. Follow the camp road<br/>
north and then easterly.<br/>
