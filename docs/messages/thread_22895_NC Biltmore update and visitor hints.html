                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went to the Biltmore today to check up on reported problems.  None found.<br/>
<br/>
I'd gotten word that George (No. 7) was missing.  He isn't; he was in plain <br/>
sight - plainer, in fact, than where I'd originally planted him.  Time for a <br/>
diet - I heard a child shout "Look!  Santa Claus is up there!" - okay, so I <br/>
was wearing a red fleece vest - but I am not THAT fat!  Nor have I a white <br/>
beard.<br/>
<br/>
Old Oak (No. 6) is still there, and frequently visited; this is one several <br/>
people have not been able to find....and in each case I ask if they are <br/>
trying to do it without a compass...and they do not reply...<br/>
<br/>
The Garden (No. 1) got its log replaced today for the 2nd time, and soggy <br/>
contents removed.  Forgot the paper towels, though, and had to use my socks <br/>
to wipe everything dry.<br/>
<br/>
Now the hint for visitors....<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the entrance fee feels steep, however, especially during the Christmas <br/>
season, you can get a much bigger bang for your buck if you plan your visit <br/>
over two days.  Check the Biltmore website for hours of admission first.  <br/>
Generally, if you buy your tickets late in the day, you can come back the <br/>
next day on the same ticket.  I think it's 3pm - but look it up first.  <br/>
So.....go late in the day - like around 4 or 4:30, when all the day visitors <br/>
are heading for supper or wherever they go.  Not only do you get to park <br/>
closer to the house, because those parking lots are emptying....you also <br/>
will - relatively speaking - have the house to yourself, and it will be lit <br/>
up beautifully for the season.  You can see more in one hour at that time <br/>
than you can during the day, waiting in lines and herded through the house <br/>
like cows.  (This is especially true for short people: you don't have to <br/>
stand on tiptoes, or look for "breaks" between tall people to glimpse the <br/>
treasures.)  Then come back the next day and find all the boxes while it's <br/>
light out.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a couple new boxes at the Biltmore soon.<br/>
