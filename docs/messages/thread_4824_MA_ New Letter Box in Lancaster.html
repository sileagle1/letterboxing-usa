"I firmly believe, from what I have seen, that this is the chosen spot <br/>
of all this earth as far as Nature is concerned." Luther Burbank, 1875 <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Lancaster, Massachusetts; the oldest town in Worcester <br/>
County. Lancaster was founded in 1653 and is now preparing for its <br/>
350th anniversary. It is situated at the confluence of the North and <br/>
South branches of the Nashua River. They join at the town's "Meeting <br/>
of the Waters" to flow north to meet the  Merrimack River in Nashua, <br/>
N.H. Lancaster is also the birthplace of noted horitculturalist Luther <br/>
Burbank on March 7, 1849. In California his birthday is celebrated as <br/>
Arbor Day, and trees are planted in his memory.<br/>
