but we hit the jackpot today: Received 13 holiday cards, 3 birthday cards (I was <br/>
50 yesterday. . .) 2 bills (we won't talk about those. . .) and the Little <br/>
Bit of Sunshine Postal LB from Purple Iris! Although it was 60 degrees for the <br/>
high, it was overcast and dreary all day (my personal favorite type of weather) <br/>
so that little bit of Sunshine went a long way!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Purple Iris!! It will be sent on its way in a day or two tops.<br/>
