                    <html><body><div><p>Howdy all! I checked out two fo the The Ususal Suspects boxes today. I replaced the Blair Witch box b/c it was cracked. Thanks to all who helped out by putting new bags and all..  There's a correction to Blair... you park on the LEFT.  My bad!  Thanks to those who noticed.  And an additional clue for Shire,b/c it's come to my attention that the rock really doesn't look like and eagle's head..  so when you get to the corner of the wall.. go to the third stone up  and follow the black swatch as it points to a little tree beyond it, and it's under the rock past that tree.  Good luck! I'm goin' out to find the hitchhikers ASAP!!  And I'm releasing one of my own sometime soon. Ciao!</p>
