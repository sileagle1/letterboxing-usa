                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know it gives one a nice feeling to know others enjoy what <br/>
you plant out there.  It's just so cool that we hide these little <br/>
boxes with stamps and logbooks in them and list the clues.  The <br/>
icing on the cake is when others can understand the clues and <br/>
go find them.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else do this?  I sat and checked the web site <br/>
repeatedly waiting to see who might venture out to find the <br/>
boxes.  Honestly, I didn't think anyone would go out today with all <br/>
the wind LOL  I figured tomorrow at the earliest.<br/>
<br/>
Now we're gonna have to go back out there and find that elusive <br/>
box.  My son #3 is just sure he knows exactly where it's at now ;^)<br/>

Yep, funny car bob was inspired by a LEGO creation.  Gotta love <br/>
LEGO!<br/>

I noticed your posts last night; as I had today off (use it or loose it<br/>
leave), I printed the clues and the info on the Lost Loons.  The forecast<br/>
was for high winds, but if it wasn't raining, I decided I was going to head<br/>
out.  There are priorities in life, Letterboxing just happens to be one of<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
My only concern was that when I got to Priest Point Park, I would get there<br/>
just in time to see the ckrmobile in the parking lot, with dvn2r ckr and her<br/>
associates returning, all smiles from their great success.  Maybe next time<br/>
:-(<br/>
<br/>
The Snow Globe stamp was great!  Looking forward to finding more of your<br/>
great stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Fudrick<br/>
