                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I know if my blade isn't sharp it ends up making a shaggy cut.<br/>
This also happens if I try to go back and re-cut an edge. Sometimes if<br/>
I support this edge with a finger and carefully cut straight down with<br/>
a really sharp blade it works out...I don't think I'm a really skilled<br/>
carver (from what I've seen by ScoutDogs &amp; others) but I have gained a<br/>
LOT of control by holding just the nib in my fingers and forgetting<br/>
the holder.  This way it becomes an extension of my hand.  <br/>

The finest line cutting tool, beside a laser, I have found is the Two <br/>
Cherries 0.5 mm gouge. I got mine from Mountain Heritage Crafters. It <br/>
runs about $42.<br/>
<br/>
You can also use a hypodermic needle. The side of the point of a 16 <br/>
gauge is pretty good. I used a smaller one for cutting the whites of <br/>
JugglerMouse's eyes.<br/>
<br/>
JugglerMouse, who carves as fine as I have seen, uses the Speedball <br/>
set but very lightly and carefully. She has more patience than I do.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

I have a question: don't you find the larger chisels heavy and hard to<br/>
control (dumb question because I've seen your carvings, but chisels<br/>
are big/heavy and rubber stamps are so small)?  I just have a hard<br/>
time keeping something that big under fine motor control.<br/>

While it may be true that I let Sir B. do this to me once and it <br/>
turned out o.k., I would caution impressionable folk out there to <br/>
only let a badger stick needles in their eyes if they already know <br/>
and trust the badger in question very well.  Also, it is best if you <br/>
have him tape your eyelids open first, as one false blink could be <br/>
disasterous.<br/>
