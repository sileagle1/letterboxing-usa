                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm dreaming of a letterbox series "from a-z" and envision themes <br/>
such as sports or history or .... My only plant started with aviation <br/>
(sports, history, invention, ...) and I ask group members to respond <br/>
with suggestions, constructive (or destructive) criticism, <br/>
willingness to participate (and at what level), questions, or <br/>
anything else at all.<br/>
 I'd especially like suggestions for ideas running the gamut from a-z <br/>
in ANY area of interest that may carry a common theme.  Once the <br/>
theme is chosen, I'll be asking for contributors to that specific <br/>
topic.(i.e. I can't do everything in such a series and encourage <br/>
participation from those who might enjoy the concept). Please <br/>
volunteer you area of 'expertise' canoeing, sailing, rock climbing, <br/>
etc)and willingness to participate in pulling it off - "from a-z" in <br/>
__________ series.<br/>
Happy letterboxing Y2K+2.<br/>
