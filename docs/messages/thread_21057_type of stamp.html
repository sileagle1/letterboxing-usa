Hi there, The stamps that we place are actually hand drawn but made by a professional stamping place... where does that place them?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I love the adventure of searching and finding, some people are SO creative with either making or buying appropriate stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
I confess, I am an addict, but a happy one!<br/>

<br/>
In the same class as the Dartmoor folks, I think. Not an entirely bad <br/>
place to be. :-)<br/>
<br/>
With an eye to the dream of a someday-trip to letterbox at Dartmoor, I <br/>
was looking at some of their websites last night. Perhaps because of <br/>
the nature of the location (the whole USA vs a large, but not <br/>
country-sized moor) the hobby/sport seems to have evolved differently <br/>
over here and a lot of the things people here say tick them off are <br/>
commonplace there. Stamps get registered and re-registered every 5 <br/>
years now - if it isn't re-registered, it's apparently removed from <br/>
'the list' since it can't be confirmed to be active. Stamps seem to be <br/>
hand-drawn, but commercially produced in most if not all cases - and I <br/>
found at least one website where the author expressed the view that <br/>
*all* Dartmoor-placed stamps should be Dartmoor related or not be <br/>
placed at all. Even the clues have a different feel.<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone gets hot, I don't think either way is better or anything <br/>
is wrong here or there. I enjoy 'our' style of letterboxing as it is. <br/>
Just found the differences interesting. And I am now even more <br/>
interested in going since the game is a bit different over there.<br/>
