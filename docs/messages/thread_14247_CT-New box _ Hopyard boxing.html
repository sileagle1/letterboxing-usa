it out- I'm very proud of the stamp- am anxiuos to hear what you all <br/>
think of it!!  We did that after boxing at the Hopyard- it's right in <br/>
our town. We were soaked after getting 2 out of the 3 boxes that are <br/>
there, the humidity was so high!! We'll go back another day that we <br/>
don't feel like driving too far to get the last one (which may <br/>
actually be missing according to the placer) Both Curious George's <br/>
Giants Chair and Drewclan's 1st Devil's Hopyard boxes were fine.  The <br/>
original logbook at the chair is full, someone left a notepad to use- <br/>
it's got plenty of room left. Nice hike!!--Sunshine ;0)<br/>
