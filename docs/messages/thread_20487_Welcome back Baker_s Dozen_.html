Just wanted to say that I'm glad you all returned safely from England.  We<br/>
had a fantastic time meeting you all.<br/>
<br/>
Mark, Sue, Butterfly and Lobsta Lady it was great to see you all again<br/>
after our wonderful time in Connecticut and to everyone else it was<br/>
brilliant to put faces to all the names as we have read many of your posts<br/>
on this site before.<br/>
<br/>
We also want to thank you all for helping us to get our Dartmoor 100 Club<br/>
badge, without all of you it would have taken us much longer and not been<br/>
nearly so enjoyable.  It was so enjoyable, in fact, that we have already<br/>
discussed plans to travel to the US again next year with the rest of our<br/>
family and if it all goes ahead hopefully this time we'll even make it to<br/>
Vermont and Boston.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I am heading back to University tomorrow where I will be meeting<br/>
with my tutor to discuss everything I found out during my trips to<br/>
Dartmoor and Connecticut and then I will begin writing the main part of my<br/>
dissertation to hand in a first draft before Christmas...what a scary<br/>
thought!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all you time and help<br/>
Keep in touch<br/>
