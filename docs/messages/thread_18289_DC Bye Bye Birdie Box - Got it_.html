&gt; I hope you can get in, and if they give you any lip, you're just <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not sure if ANYONE stamped in...it was only there for the <br/>
week, <br/>
&gt; and I was too busy getting yelled at by the director to check on <br/>
it.<br/>

I was afraid the BBBBox would be trapped there until someone threw it <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt anyone had a chance to stamp it.  <br/>
<br/>
Set it free, let it fly.<br/>
And thanks again.<br/>
