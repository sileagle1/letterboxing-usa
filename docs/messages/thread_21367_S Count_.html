After Funhog produced the Cone-u-copia for the Pinecone Pepes, it is my<br/>
guess that this little event will probably start a new phase in<br/>
letterboxing. Since many of us rely on complete data reporting along<br/>
with other minutia, I have given this particular event much thought and<br/>
consideration. What would the recipients do with their bounty? Send them<br/>
off as hitch hikers?  Plant them in a multiple box series?  What could<br/>
they be considered in the PFX count?  Since these are  complex questions<br/>
and many could only be answered by the recipient I have limited my focus<br/>
strictly to what they should be called and I wish to submit---S count.<br/>
Now if you consider that the recipient is unaware of the number,<br/>
type,content, style, or even that they will be receiving them at all,<br/>
then the S surely fits, and that S will stand for "SPAMps". The Pepes<br/>
could now proudly list in their count S 17. <br/>
