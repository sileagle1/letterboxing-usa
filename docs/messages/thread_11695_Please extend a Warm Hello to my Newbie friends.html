Lori from TeamGreenDragon went on a ski trip to Maine with my <br/>
childhood (nonletterboxing) friend Mary.  We began by trying <br/>
to find the "Nubble light and the Mouser" letterbox in York.<br/>
We never found the sign for the lighthouse, we just drove<br/>
along the coast til we "saw the light". It was very foggy, rainy<br/>
and windy.  Mary actually found the box. We brought it to the<br/>
car to stamp in and I rehid it. Mary wasn't happy cuz her hair<br/>
got all messed up (and she ended up with a really BAD cold).<br/>
<br/>
After this, we continued to Topsham, Maine where other of our <br/>
childhood friends (Ruth and Steve) live. They graciously opened <br/>
their home to us. After explaining what letterboxing was<br/>
all about, Ruth, Mary and Ruth's darlink 8 (soon to be 9) year<br/>
old daughter and myself dashed off to Walmart to pick up<br/>
supplies to place a box in Topsham.  Katie picked out a cute<br/>
little stamp that we all agreed upon.  Ruth brought us to a <br/>
local landmark and after some deliberation, our illustrious <br/>
Katie found the perfect crevice to place the box in.<br/>
Clues to be posted soon.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that Ruth and her beautiful little Katie will become<br/>
avid letterboxers and hope you will all welcome them warmly.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Lori - TeamGreenDragon :)<br/>
