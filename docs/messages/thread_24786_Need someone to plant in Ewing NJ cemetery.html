     Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
     I am carving a stamp of my late husband for the memorial LTC ring, <br/>
and I thought it would be nice, after it is carved, to plant it where he <br/>
is buried, in the Ewing Cemetery. Is there anyone would would volunteer <br/>
to plant and own this box? It is right across the Delaware from Yardley <br/>
PA where he grew up.<br/>
<br/>
     I would really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
     I can't tell you where exactly in the cemetery is his grave, <br/>
though! You would have to find it.<br/>
<br/>
