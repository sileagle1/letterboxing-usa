Hide a box in your yard.  When searchers come looking, hand them a <br/>
weed whacker.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2 ) How do I explain my golf game ( or rather lack there of ) to <br/>
the guys at work ?<br/>
<br/>
Tell them you got your hand caught in the ball washer and your doctor <br/>
has told you that hitting small objects with a metal stick will only <br/>
exacerbate the problem.<br/>

As for golf, I have a set of clubs collecting dust.  I prefer <br/>

hunt, its usually tooooo cold to go letterboxing!!! <br/>

Of course you could always get the guys at work to try letterboxing <br/>
and then you will all be of the same "talent" when golfing... anyone <br/>
tried hiding LB's on golf courses yet???<br/>
