lazy in the hot sunshine to do any more hiking in the woods that that). We <br/>
found the Legend of Pudding Lane letterbox after school (in good condition, <br/>
and right near some nice rocks to sit and stamp in on), and lo and behold -- <br/>
we found a hitchhiker!! I was sooo excited! We found the FFA at 75 HH, <br/>
originally planted by Leader of the Pack in PA, but conveniently returned <br/>
home to CT by Wanda and Pete. FFA will be back on the trails as soon as we <br/>
are! Enjoy the sunshine everyone!<br/>
