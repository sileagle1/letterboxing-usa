                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi.  We're seeking anyone who ever found our box TrueBlue - located <br/>
in Lower Allen Park, Mechanicsburg, PA.<br/>
<br/>
We have a few questions, and would appreciate your help.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime - for anyone seeking this box, it has been removed <br/>
until we can find a better placement along the same trail - it was <br/>
severely damaged by the recent rains and enclosed Ziploc Bags left <br/>
open. :(<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time!<br/>
