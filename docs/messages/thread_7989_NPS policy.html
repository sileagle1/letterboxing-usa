I found this sentence particularly interesting from the NPS<br/>
"I am sure that the activity is interesting and enjoyable for the participants but leaving  containers in odd locations within national parks can cause alarm in these days and times." a gladware box? I scared! <br/>
Like someone is going to bomb the park. I say keep Bush out and there will be no problem for security. I think the real issue is one of CONTROL. They want to control your every step in the public parks in the name of protecting the wildlife while the govenment is allowing polution of our air and water which effects wildlife far more than a small plactic box under a rock could possibly do. The government needs to be in CONTROL of all aspects of our lives. NOT!<br/>
<br/>
I have asked the webmasters to pull my clues that might lead one into a National Park. I am sure I missed one or two since  I practically live in a National Park. Most all parks in the DC area are National. They can pick up the boxes themselves or anyone who finds one soon can just relocate it for me and write up new clues. Last year someone pulled one from Antitem for me and rewrote very nice clues. The race is on!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I certainly can empathize with your concern for our National Parks.  <br/>
I, too, have seen alot of trash and environmental damage throughout <br/>
our various parks in this region during my last 4 months of <br/>
letterboxing.  It is all too disheartening.  I do not think that <br/>
this damage was caused by letterboxers or letterboxes, but I do see <br/>
where additional damage can be caused when the clues aren't terribly <br/>
specific when nearing the 'hiding' spot.  I think most letterboxers <br/>
incorporate the tenets of Leaving No Trace (LNT) when they <br/>
participate but I'm sure there exist some who are so exhuberant when <br/>
searching for a box that they'll leave no stone unturned.  <br/>
<br/>
I have learned quite a bit in my few shorts months of letterboxing--<br/>
sparing extra damage to the environment is all rooted in finding THE <br/>
PERFECT LOCATION FOR HIDING YOUR LETTERBOX.  Some of my boxes aren't <br/>
in the greatest locations but as I've gotten more experienced with <br/>
the hobby, I've gotten much better at finding unique and 'damage <br/>
free' locations for hiding boxes (like in hollow tree stumps or <br/>
behind logs, perched between boulders/rocks, hanging from trees, <br/>
etc).  I am one of the guilty ones who has placed a box in far-off <br/>
NPS lands (before I knew about the rule/regulation/desires to not <br/>
allow letterboxing on their lands)--but I can guarantee that my box <br/>
does not cause any additional traffic in the area and in no way <br/>
damages the environment.  It might bother the 6' tall dead tree that <br/>
it's perched in from above, but the tree's already dead, so I don't <br/>
think it cares!  ;)  A bird could still nest in there, but the area <br/>
is prone to hurricane level gale force winds so I don't think the <br/>
birds would last very long there, either.  Somehow, the tree has...  <br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
One thing in this message that bothered me was the political <br/>
reference within the message.  Please note that there are many <br/>
people from many different political persuasions on this board.  I <br/>
do not think that this is an issue that is driven by the leaders of <br/>
the country--it is an internal issue that apparently is being more <br/>
heavily pursued at different and specific NPS locales throughout our <br/>
great nation.  Many of these parks might have already experienced a <br/>
negative event in regards to letterboxing or geocaching.  This is <br/>
where we have to help educate them in how friendly and educational <br/>
our sport is &amp; that it seems to attract the very same people who are <br/>
attracted to our National Parks.   I'm sure this issue will be <br/>
elevated to a national level very quickly if many folks start <br/>
contacting their Congressional Representatives.  Regardless, it only <br/>
makes sense to work with the system and perhaps the individual <br/>
parks/locales where you'd like to place a letterbox instead <br/>
of 'fighting it' so we can maintain the great reputation that the <br/>
LBNA organization currently bears.<br/>
<br/>
Despite our differences, we're all on the same team here!  Imagine <br/>
what a group of galvanized letterboxers, from ALL political <br/>
persuasions and backgrounds, who share a passion for the hobby and <br/>
an enthusiasm for nature and exercise, can accomplish in a campaign <br/>
to prove to NPS just how environmentally friendly, historically <br/>
beneficial and exciting letterboxing can be!!!   Just a thought...<br/>
<br/>
Have a great letterboxing day!!!<br/>
