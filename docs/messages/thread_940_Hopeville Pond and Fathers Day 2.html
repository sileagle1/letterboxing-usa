                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, forgot to mention our significant tree series. We've got "big" <br/>
(hee hee) plans to letterbox the CT Notable Trees. So far we've only <br/>
officially done the Norwich Maple (in its day the largest sugar maple <br/>
in the world):<br/>
<br/>
(http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/drewclan/bigtrees.htm)<br/>
<br/>
but we've also put a box in at what we think is the largest black oak <br/>
in Connecticut in our "Generations" box:<br/>
<br/>
(http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/drewclan/local2.htm#Generations)<br/>
<br/>
and although Mountain Laurel doesn't count as a "tree," we also boxed <br/>
the Giant Laurel in Wadsworth's Falls State Park in Meriden:<br/>
<br/>
(http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/drewclan/local6.htm#Wadsworth)<br/>
<br/>
(And, by the way, have you EVER seen a better Mountain Laural display <br/>
than this year's? The place has just EXPLODED!) We're thinking about <br/>
adding the Ledyard Oak, the Ashway Oak, several of the big exotics at <br/>
Conn College, and that Trinity College Forest/Avenue in Manchester to <br/>
the grouping sometime this summer. There was a great list of notable <br/>
trees in the last edition of American Forester, and we've got a <br/>
sometimes-working link to another site on our "links" webpage if <br/>
you're interested. And, there's a book called "CT's Notable Trees" <br/>
available at the DEP website if you'd like to learn more and/or beat <br/>
us to some of these boxy sites!<br/>
<br/>
Gotta "leave," Jay<br/>
<br/>
-&gt; One quick question, is the Fathers day box going to be<br/>
&gt; a permenet box or a temp.  If it was a Temporary box I<br/>
&gt; was thinking it coould be changed or added to the<br/>
&gt; "Significant Tree" series.  Are there any other Tree<br/>
&gt; Boxes beside the one in Norwich?<br/>

near the "undisputed champion" (if i got that right). Those are a couple of <br/>
neato trees but then again hiding a box there might be tough as it is sorta <br/>
in the open.<br/>
