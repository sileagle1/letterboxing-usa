Welcome back. I'm the evil moderator that banned you when I should have put<br/>
you on moderation status. A few minutes later, when I realized that I did<br/>
the wrong thing, I unbanned you. You probably didn't realize it but you<br/>
could have signed back up as gingerbreadjunk. Hopefully, we can both learn<br/>
from out mistakes and move on.<br/>

<br/>
I too will appologize for my "stupid" remark.<br/>
<br/>
Dave here is a listing of various sites you can research to find <br/>
most of the answers to your questions.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing.org:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html<br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug's site:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/<br/>
Doug probably has the best info site on Hitchhikers and links to <br/>
regional chatlists.<br/>
<br/>
AtlasQuest:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/<br/>
Ryan has a link set up "Code of Conduct" that is really good for all<br/>
boxers to read<br/>
<br/>
newboxers' group:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
Where there is no dumb question, and is "the" place for many<br/>
newletterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to these sites you can find listings of other sites on <br/>
the left hand side of the chatlist home page, as well as listings on <br/>
the LBNA home page. You should be advised that many times there are <br/>
hidden clues lodged in informational sites as well as the great info <br/>
that can be found.  Many times things are not what they seem, and <br/>
that includes past "flames" listed in the archives of this list.<br/>
