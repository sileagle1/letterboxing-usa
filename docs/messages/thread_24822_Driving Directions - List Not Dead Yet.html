or at least serving no purpose other than a place to vent, but these <br/>
recent discussions have convinced me there is still life in the Old <br/>
List yet.  Several opposing views were stated in a civil manner, with a <br/>
little humor thrown in, and the result was a stimulating discussion.  <br/>
Randy, thanks for keeping it (and your faith in us) around all these <br/>
years, and here's to another 10 years!<br/>

&gt; For my part, I think finders who never plant (newbies excluded, of,<br/>
&gt; course), should offer up a gratuity to the planters for providing for<br/>
&gt; their entertainment.  If this doesn't get the messages flying and the<br/>
&gt; asbestos underwear donned, then we know the list is dead, and ready<br/>
&gt; to be decommissioned, which is a fine prospect in my book.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers<br/>
