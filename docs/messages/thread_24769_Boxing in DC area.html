Too bad I am not going to be down this weekend, or I would offer to meet <br/>
for an exchange.<br/>
<br/>
I am rather fond of Mister Toad's Valentine <br/>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=67163).  <br/>
Schizokeet says it is the best box she has ever found, but we are both <br/>
rather bias.<br/>
<br/>
Check out Merlin Bewitched <br/>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=54389) if you <br/>
get the chance.  Bunny Fruit Chews <br/>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=46009) are a <br/>
lot of fun, and Ghost Castle of East Falls Church <br/>
(http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=1924) just has <br/>
some great clues.<br/>
<br/>
If you can, get in touch with Scarab, you are sure to have some real fun <br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your visit.<br/>

Stones for a post-security exchange (very cool).<br/>

A tribute to Dr. Suess (http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?<br/>

Winged Victory (http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?<br/>

These are located near Sugarloaf Mountain in Maryland (which is <br/>
another excellent hike).<br/>

based on the recommendation here. It was a great quick trip. And <br/>
there were kids playing capture the hill while I was there on the <br/>
west side (box is on the east side).<br/>
<br/>
But you have found Radio Days????? I have tried three times, but each <br/>
time I made it over there (I work about a :20 brisk walk away) there <br/>
have just been too many homeless folks for me to make an attempt. <br/>
Feel bad for them all, but it is too easy to go broke trying to help <br/>
even a few every time I go about town. Guess I will have to go by <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have done all but one of the boxes in the Accotink Bay. The <br/>
duck hunters weren't happy with me and I rushed and forgot to get the <br/>
bonus box clue.  <br/>
<br/>
So many boxes, so little time. . .<br/>
