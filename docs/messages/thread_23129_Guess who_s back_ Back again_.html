                    <div class="plaintext-content">so im back from the dirty south. now i know why they call it dirty. my <br/>
car was so dirty from all the clay. dang! well, i didn't find as many <br/>
boxes as i had hoped. who knew that a box that looks on a map to be an <br/>
hour and a half away, would actually be three! everything is so spread <br/>
out. but none the less, i has found boxes in Vicksburg Mississippi, <br/>
Hot Springs Arkansas, Shreveport Louisiana, and Jefferson Texas. I <br/>
would suggest all these places and others, to others to go to. All <br/>
these places had lots of history and a couple boxes. You may find <br/>
yourself struck with wonder instead of wondering where the box is <br/>
located. I have placed a box in Shreveport Louisiana and it is <br/>
temporary. When my brother moves, he will pick it up and place it <br/>
somewhere else. This box is called Fur's Class Stamp, and will <br/>
continue to move with him as he will for his job. I hope that everyone <br/>
someday gets to travel somewhere and experience what i had last week.<br/>
Oh and Mardi Gras was awesome.<br/>
