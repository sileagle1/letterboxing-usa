I've thought about placing a letterbox with a stamp of a railroad<br/>
engine at the north end of the trail and a letterbox stamp of a<br/>
caboose at the south end, with various other railroad cars along the<br/>
trail.  Then it occurred to me, that in following years, as I find<br/>
more neat hiding places, I could add boxes to the series.  The problem<br/>
is, I'd be adding them to the middle of the series.  If people saved<br/>
space in their logbooks for a four stamp series and then the next year<br/>
it was six stamps, would they be mad at me?<br/>
<br/>
If you're going after a set, and you don't complete the run, do you<br/>
save space in your logbook for the rest of the set?  I know I did for<br/>
"That Darn Cat" and "Gambler" series.  Or do you just stamp them in as<br/>
you find them in strict chronological order?<br/>

I stamp in on loose card stock then save in a scrapbook, but I like the<br/>
chronological order--there is usually a good story if I didn't get a series<br/>
in order.<br/>
<br/>
Love your planned series!  It is one I would make an effort to find.<br/>

I'll remove all the stamps, organize them and put them into the big<br/>
scrap book I picked up last winter.<br/>

It seems like some series do expand over time, so go ahead.  If<br/>
worried, you might mention that the series will expand.<br/>

order!!  But I think that it's personal preference.  I<br/>
like the card stock idea, though.<br/>
<br/>
I have my own HH stamp series, the "Stampcatchers" ...<br/>
I've been planting them in various states, and each<br/>
stamp stays in the state it's been planted in.  So<br/>
depending on how many states I visit/send HH's to, I<br/>
could have up to 50 in this series!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck - I love the train theme.  I'm hoping to be<br/>
able to find them once they're planted<br/>

them into plastic sheets(with 3 holes for binders) then put them into <br/>
said binder. If you need to you can move them around. You can also go <br/>
back and add stamps to the back of the sheet if more boxes are added <br/>
to the series or if it got too dark to finish like we did two weeks <br/>
ago.<br/>

in my area have been "temporarily removed by park personnel." You <br/>
wouldn't think that a rail/ trail would be considered a "park." <br/>

Also, I'm not sure what "temporary" means, but that message was <br/>
