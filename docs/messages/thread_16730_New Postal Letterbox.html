                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi! I'm thinking of starting a new postal letterbox - "The Scouting Postal Letterbox". <br/>
<br/>
My idea is to send it to people that have been involved in Scouting (Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, even Campfire girls!). Stamp in and write your favorite memory of scouting! If your kids are in Scouting I would love for them to add their memories as well. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not trying to exclude anyone with this. Please don't feel that way if you have never participated in Scouting. <br/>
<br/>
I must warn you that the stamp *may* be store bought as I am really not very good at carving yet! <br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in participating please email me off list with your name and address. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Excellent idea! As an Eagle Scout, I'd love to get<br/>
this one in the mail.<br/>
