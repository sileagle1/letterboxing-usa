&gt; &gt; I'm sorry but I can't agree with you regarding some points here.<br/>
A <br/>
&gt; &gt; few months ago, I learned about letterboxing and was extremely<br/>
&gt; &gt; excited to start participating in the adventure.  Over the past <br/>
&gt; &gt; couple of months I have placed and located several boxes in my <br/>
&gt; &gt; area.  I received a message from Glenn (of Tacoma) the day I <br/>
placed <br/>
&gt; &gt; my first letterbox (in July, I think) that included a video of<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; antics at my letterbox that I placed in my hometown near the<br/>
&gt; Seattle<br/>
&gt; &gt; area.  I perceived the 15 second video clip they included as<br/>
&gt; &gt; something pretty jovial and sort of a gentle 'hazing' to welcome <br/>
me <br/>
&gt; &gt; into the sport of letterboxing.  I took it as a friendly gesture<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a threat or intimidation.  The video suggested that they found<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box and simply tossed it in the general location of its <br/>
actual <br/>
&gt; &gt; hiding place and left without putting it back.  This was just a<br/>
&gt; &gt; joke, upon further inspection, the letterbox was actual re-hidden <br/>
&gt; &gt; safe and sound in its intended hiding place.  I'm not sure what <br/>
&gt; else<br/>
&gt; &gt; has transpired in this community regarding the various men in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Seattle/Tacoma area.  I just want to defend Glenn in this <br/>
&gt; particular<br/>
&gt; &gt; case as I never felt threatened or intimidated by his antics in<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; case.<br/>
