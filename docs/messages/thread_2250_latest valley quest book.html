I just received the spring 2001 Vital Communities <br/>
newsletter, which is offering the 5th edition of the<br/>
Valley Quest Map Book, with 89 letterboxes, including<br/>
close to 40 new ones.  (The edition I have has 52, so<br/>
I guess there are 37 new ones ...)<br/>
<br/>
More information is on their web site at <br/>
http://www.vitalcommunities.org/, although the web site<br/>
is not as up to date as the newsletter.  (The ordering<br/>
address on the web site is correct, but the catalog and<br/>
price is wrong; the price is now $16.50 ($12.95 + s/h)).<br/>
This edition features a "water resistant cover" and a<br/>
"binding that can weather years of use". <br/>
<br/>
For those who don't know, the VQ program was the first<br/>
organized and ongoing letterboxing-like pastime in the <br/>
US (AFAIK), started in 1989.  The boxes are done by <br/>
grade school children, and can be quite fun.  If you <br/>
find 21, you can order a nice patch, a picture of which<br/>
is on their web site.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Isn't that interesting!! None of us who thought we were pioneering <br/>
letterboxing in the US were even close to being at the frontier. <br/>
Seems appropriate that US letterboxing was not "started" by any of <br/>
us, but rather a bunch of school children. I sure hope any "official" <br/>
history of US letterboxing will reflect that it was the children who <br/>
led the way.<br/>
