<br/>
I found my first three letterboxes yesterday!  And by a simple twist of <br/>
fate, all three were placed by Wingfoot (as well as the boxes I'm hunting <br/>
this week: High Mountain Preserve in Wayne).  Mt. Hope Historical Park's box <br/>
is doing fine, though it seems I'm the first person to visit it since <br/>
mid-march.  You folks should check it out if you're ever around Rockaway <br/>
Twp, NJ... beautiful dense forest in a park built around abandoned mines-- <br/>
the forest seems a bed of thick moss!<br/>
<br/>
The Tourne box is fine, intact, doing OK... the Mountainside box is allright <br/>
but the logbook is quite damp in one corner of it, so that may need to <br/>
replaced? or something...<br/>
<br/>
This was my first time letterboxing [i just got my stamp in on Friday] and I <br/>
as such completely forgot to bring extra info sheets!  All three boxes are <br/>
out of info sheets, so the next person to visit them may want to bring <br/>
refills!  =c)  Have a happy monday...<br/>

Thanks for the update, I always like to hear about folks visiting my <br/>
letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Once I got over a dozen boxes planted, it got kinda tough to keep up <br/>
with checking on them, so I rely on the talklist to find out about <br/>
their status.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy the Down Under Series, however I think one of the <br/>
boxes notebooks does need to be replaced.<br/>
