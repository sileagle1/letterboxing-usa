once every Spring for about a week... but I passed your question on <br/>
to a friend (and newly converted letterboxer!) in Cairo, and he <br/>
advises me that from Beckly it is 45 minutes- 1 hour to Charleston, <br/>
and from Charleston it is 1 1/2 hours to Cario.<br/>
<br/>
Which is a very short trip considering the wonders you would see once <br/>
you got there....           -Jugglermouse<br/>

&gt; Is that anywhere near Beckley? I have family in the Beckley/Oak <br/>
Hill area and visit from time to time. If Ritchie's close, it would <br/>
make a good side trip.<br/>
