Washington State /  Whatcom County / City of Bellingham<br/>
<br/>
Bring your dog and go for a walk in Lake Padden Park. Lake Padden is a<br/>
Bellingham city park and they have thoughtfully provided an off-leash dog<br/>
training area where you and your dog can have a game of frisbee, fetch<br/>
sticks, or just have a good run around. Dont forget your poop bags.<br/>
<br/>
Use the east entrance to Lake Padden Park.  When you reach the Y, stay right<br/>
towards the lake and picnic area. Drive as far as you can go and park. Check<br/>
the large map at the trailhead and find the off-leash dog training area.<br/>
Walk your dog to the training area and find the memorial plaque for Elke<br/>
Hart by the bench seat.  From there take a compass bearing of 207 true and<br/>
travel along this bearing until you come to an opening in the trees. A trail<br/>
crosses your path but your route crosses it and a small stream. Once over<br/>
the stream you reach a Y and veer to your right traveling uphill at 285<br/>
true for 55 strides (2 steps = 1 stride) and turn left on a smaller trail<br/>
traveling 80 strides uphill where you come to another trail taking a sharp<br/>
left hand turn. Travel that trail on for 15 strides to a large rotten stump<br/>
just off the trail on your left. The letterbox / cache is inside the stump<br/>
covered by forest debris.<br/>
This letterbox is inside of a geocache (see www.geocaching.com) containing<br/>
dog related items (balls, bandanas, tug toys, etc.). If you like, bring a<br/>
trade item, get your dog a toy and return to the dog off-leash area for some<br/>
play. <br/>
<br/>
The map at the parking lot trailhead shows other park amenities such as<br/>
trails, fishing, swimming, sports fields and picnic areas.<br/>
<br/>
We hope you enjoy this letterbox, Lake Padden Park, and an outing with your<br/>
dog!  <br/>
