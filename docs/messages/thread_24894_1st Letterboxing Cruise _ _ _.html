<br/>
We are all back with wobbly legs and big grins.  If you missed out, I<br/>
think most folks will be posting photos to the AQ Event.<br/>
<br/>
Pine Cone Adventures (Mark/Sue Pepe) did a fantastic job and I am so<br/>
very glad I joined them and met new folks and got lots of stamps planted<br/>
on board ship and a few previously planted on land.  Don't miss any<br/>
future adventures.  The more the merrier when it comes to cruising<br/>
PineCone Style.<br/>
<br/>
There was some grumbling about Norwegian Cruise Line - Dawn which you<br/>
might want to consider for your next cruise and these have nothing to do<br/>
with Pepe:<br/>
<br/>
1. Not all restaurants are free -- i.e. $10, $15, &amp; $20 cover charges<br/>
will get you fancy service but not necessarily fancier food than you<br/>
could get in the Aqua or Venetian for $0.<br/>
<br/>
2. In addition to alcoholic drinks  sodas, juices, and bottle water is<br/>
an extra charge -- unless you order 8 glasses of juice with the morning<br/>
room service before 10AM.  There was a juice dispenser for breakfast in<br/>
the buffet (Garden Cafe).  But I like ice tea so I was ok.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The only really 24hr food was available at the Blue Lagoon -- which<br/>
probably only sat about 60 people of the 2000 on board.  I think the<br/>
service there would have been better had it not been located along a<br/>
main passage way from midship to aft.  Just too much commotion.  And the<br/>
menu was very limited - although I liked the tomato basil soup and mild<br/>
buffalo wings.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Since the Wed Nite Hamilton street festival lasted until 10PM, NCL<br/>
should have had one of the buffet lines open for a late nite meal -<br/>
sandwiches or the like.  Blue Lagoon was a mad house.<br/>
<br/>
5. THINK TWICE about booking an excursion thru the Excursion Desk. <br/>
Several of us had booked for an 8PM Bermuda Triangle cruise (glass<br/>
bottom botton and free Dark 'n' Stormy) for Thur eve.  After a busy day<br/>
on land we got back to the ship to find a note on our doors that it was<br/>
canceled due to lack of participation.  Now the excursion desk has very<br/>
very limited hours so how was one suppose to learn about this<br/>
excursion?!?!?  But more aggravating was that by Wed nite they should<br/>
have known about the limited participation and notified us by phone<br/>
message that it was likely to be canceled, would we like to do the 1PM<br/>
afternoon ride??  (which itself was almost canceled for lack of riders).<br/>
Those who went at 1PM had a great time!!!  Turning green with envy.  The<br/>
Excursion Desk could have turned this around with a small room credit --<br/>
so we could have gotten a Dark'n'Stormy on board or some postcards etc. <br/>
The excursion required 48 hr notice for me to cancel but jerked me<br/>
around with less than 3hrs notice!!  True the excursion was really<br/>
conducted by Fantasea -- but NCL was handling all the reservations.<br/>
<br/>
6.  I wouldn't take a cruise that didn't have an interest group (like<br/>
letterboxing) because I went to one show in the theater and it was<br/>
bombarded with commercials.  The Cruise Director was pushing spending<br/>
more money on board at every opportunity.  I dreaded hearing his voice<br/>
over the loud speakers -- since I didn't have a mute button.  Had it not<br/>
been for all the LBrs I would have been bored to death on board.<br/>
<br/>
7.  There had been some minor thefts -- door decorations/clues -- at<br/>
which security turned up their noses. Also during disembarking all the<br/>
luggage grouped by about 5 color codes is set out in large areas such<br/>
that finding your piece could be impossible or likely grabbed by someone<br/>
else rushing to catch a plane. Such that rather than putting our bags<br/>
outside the cabin the last nite (Sat) many of us chose to carry (wheel)<br/>
our own luggage off.  Keep that in mind when packing.  Bring only<br/>
wheeled luggage!!<br/>
<br/>
8.  But the finishing touch was when we left the ship at Deck 7 to cross<br/>
over to the pier, the gangway cover didn't quite meet the ship and they<br/>
were stupidly hosing down the upper decks so I thought it was raining -<br/>
instead we were being subjected to a drenching shower as we crossed over<br/>
-- had I slipped I would have sued for a million dollars (having only<br/>
come in second on the murder mystery contest).<br/>
<br/>
All that said, you need to read all the fine print and search for cruise<br/>
reviews before you sign up.  The Dawn as a ship was beautiful and I was<br/>
in awe of  the size and decor.  Also found it very clean and the cabin<br/>
staff very helpful.  Which reminds me there is a $10/da/adult charge to<br/>
your account for tipping cabin, food, and matre 'de staff.  I had no<br/>
objection to that but some folks were caught off guard.<br/>

            Brochures already in the mail from several cruise lines.<br/>
<br/>
            If you missed this trip - don't despair - there will most likely<br/>
be another in a few years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            Let me add to what has been written. Sue &amp; I had a blast.<br/>
<br/>
            This was a great group with many wonderful carvers with<br/>
innovative ideas and a real sense of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the hides were really mind-blowing and Sue &amp; I so enjoyed the late<br/>
night hunts onboard the Dawn with the lazy Letterboxer and the letterboxing<br/>
ham as well as the 2 Putts.<br/>
<br/>
            Kudos to all who carved and planted.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Brian of TeamGreenDragon for another beautifully carved event<br/>
stamp with a gorgeous handmade logbook by the master - Alafair.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to SapphireBerry who spent hours upon hours developing her CSI<br/>
murder mystery. We understand that the letterboxing public might have a<br/>
chance to participate in this drama in the future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sue &amp; I came home relaxed, happy and tanned with tons of memories (and sea<br/>
glass) and great images of found boxes and exchanges in our logbook. We hope<br/>
to have some pictures and a brief diary about our trip early next week.<br/>

I saw the cruise listed on AtlasQuest and wished I could be part of it. If there is interest in doing another one, I would like to let any organizers know that I am a cruise specialist and would be happy to help put it together. I can't think of anything much more fun than letterboxing your way to a variety of destinations, and leaving letterboxes in those destinations for other travelers to find. Cool!<br/>
