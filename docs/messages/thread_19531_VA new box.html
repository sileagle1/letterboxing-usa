Here is a new box, just placed today.<br/>
<br/>
I'm posting here since there is some confusion regarding my membership on the list even though I've been there a couple of years. Anyway here it is for now. <br/>
<br/>
Haiku by Bash, 1 &amp; 2. <br/>
<br/>
Placed by TownCrier 74.<br/>
<br/>
Placement Date: 20 July 2004.<br/>
<br/>
State: Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
County: Fairfax.<br/>
<br/>
Nearest City: Springfield.<br/>
<br/>
Number of Boxes: 2.<br/>
<br/>
Fairfax Cross County Trail, Accotink Stream Valley Park, Daventry.<br/>
<br/>
May be approached from either the North or South. If coming from Fairfax County 7100/Franconia Springfield 7900 Parkways, exit North on Rolling Road. Take a right onto Hunter Village Drive. If coming from I-95 mixing bowl, take Old Keene Mill Road west and turn left onto Hunter Village Drive. Park just to the North of the 90 degree curve on Hunter Village Drive and Painted Daisy Drive. Parking available on both sides of the road. <br/>
<br/>
Note the first Fairfax Cross County Trail marker on the east side of the road. <br/>
<br/>
Although the round trip is less than a mile, the start (and finish) is a lengthy, rather steep, hill. Not suitable for wheelchairs or any other wheeled vehicle. If you need to use a stroller, please be extremely careful, I suggest you either carry the children or let them walk down the hill.<br/>
<br/>
The English translations of the Japanese Haiku are contained in their respective boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Box # 1.<br/>
<br/>
Koe ni mina<br/>
<br/>
naki-shimaute ya <br/>
<br/>
semi-no-kara.<br/>
<br/>
Matsuo Bash - 1644 -1694. Considered by many to be the greatest Haiku writer of all time. Translation based on Henderson, Harold G. An Introduction to Haiku. New York: Doubleday, 1958.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the trail down the hill to the T section. There will be two FCCT markers (second &amp; third) indicating the trail to the left. Go to the inevitable wooden bridge. At the bridge find Bash box # 1 under the eastern corner after crossing over the bridge. <br/>
<br/>
Box # 2.<br/>
<br/>
Furike ya<br/>
<br/>
kawazu tobikomu<br/>
<br/>
mizu no oto.<br/>
<br/>
Although considered by many to be Bash«ís finest Haiku, I must confess that I have some difficulty connecting to this one. But Im still working on it. Translation based on Blyth, R. Haiku Volume 1; Eastern Culture. Tokyo: Hokuseido Press, 1981. <br/>
<br/>
After properly replacing box # 1 such that it cannot be seen from the trail, continue on. After passing a macadam trail to the left and two more streams, you will pass the fourth FCCT marker. Soon you will find a wider extension of the main trail on your left going uphill to the west. Go up this trail about 16 paces (two steps per pace). Look to your right and spot a group of three trees approximately 6 yards off the trail. Go to these trees, two of which turn out to be dead, and look into the center of the group. There you will find Bash # 2. <br/>
<br/>
After replacing box # 2 such that it cannot be seen from the trail. Return the way you came. <br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoyed the Haiku and the trail.<br/>
