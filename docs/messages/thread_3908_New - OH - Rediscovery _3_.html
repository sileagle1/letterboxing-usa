Valley of the Frogs:  Episode IV  Rediscovery<br/>
<br/>
In the valley, where men once did pass<br/>
Three frogs deep in conversation<br/>
Sat in their algae and grass<br/>
<br/>
Ribit said the first<br/>
Ribbett said the second<br/>
Rhabat said the third<br/>
<br/>
"We're quite a herd" said number one<br/>
"Frogs ain't herds!" said two<br/>
"I will be heard!" said three<br/>
<br/>
RHABAT!<br/>
And then <br/>
After a pause<br/>
<br/>
Ribit<br/>

Park at N 39* 47.635 min, W 83* 50.521 min.  You can find this with a <br/>
GPS receiver or with an interactive topographic map at <br/>
www.topozone.com.  The topographic map would be a good idea in any <br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the Orton Picnic Area sign.  A map of the park may be <br/>
available at this sign.  The trail you need is at 210 degrees from <br/>
this sign across a mowed area of the park.  Go down the trail.  It <br/>
merges with the Rim trail and you go first right, then left from the <br/>
Rim Trail to continue down the hill to a footbridge across the Little <br/>
Miami River.<br/>
<br/>
At the base of the far end of the foot bridge, where the right hand <br/>
rail ends, examine the rock next to the concrete footing.  (Ribit)<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the trail along the river on a heading of 180 degrees at <br/>
the beginning, but turning more and more to the west.  260 paces (1 <br/>
pace = 2 steps; about 5 feet) later you are parallel to an island in <br/>
the river.  Arriving at a footbridge between two rock walls you note <br/>
a steel bolt sticking up out of the right side of the far wall.  <br/>
<br/>
At 330 degrees and a distance of 24 inches from the bolt, you <br/>
carefully examine an 8" by 4" rock in the center of the top of the <br/>
wall.  (Ribbett)<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the footbridge and across it, you count paces from the <br/>
Clifton Gorge sign as you begin to climb the hill toward your car.  <br/>
At 27 paces, a large rock at the right side of the trail gets your <br/>
attention.  A niche in the rock at the height of your navel is filled <br/>
with a moss-covered rock.  From under it you hear a sound:  (RHABAT)<br/>
<br/>
You already know that other letterboxes are nearby:  Covered Bridge, <br/>
Horace Man, and Whispering Pines.  Could it be that other small frogs <br/>
are hidden in the Valley of Frogs?  Keep in touch.  They may be.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  All the Valley of Frogs letterboxes are micro boxes.  They <br/>
contain a strip of paper as a log and a small stamp in a 35mm film <br/>
canister.  Please use a small (1 inch diameter or smaller) stamp for <br/>
these boxes.  None of them contain a stamp pad.<br/>
