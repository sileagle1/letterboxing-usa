   2000 finds is awesome but I think franzolo or someone in the <br/>
Cincinnati area has more plants than finds. Both numbers are past <br/>
100. Now that is very time consuming and deserves recognition!<br/>

So far we have planted 47 boxes, which we suspect is still slightly <br/>
higher than the "national letterbox planting average"!(albeit skewed <br/>
by folks like Carolyn and the incredible Jay Drew!) However, as we've <br/>
said before, please understand that we're just not particularly drawn <br/>
to the creative or artsy aspects of this hobby, so don't expect much <br/>
from us in those areas! We're mostly just hikers who have discovered <br/>
that we don't mind occasionally going out of our way to find boxes!!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,carving,planting,greeting or whatever your thing may <br/>
be! <br/>
<br/>

Before this thread gets really going, as we all know it will !! I want<br/>
to wish Wanda happy trails in the months you will be gone from Our Neck<br/>
of the Woods. While you are gone, I am sure many new and seasoned<br/>
letterboxers will be planting boxes. I for one will miss your posts. I<br/>
still remember your kind words at my first stumbling plantings and<br/>
carvings. At the time I was really touched that you even took the time<br/>
to look for my boxes.  You always have a possitive note to write about<br/>
the hike, or box, or stamp. Sometimes I really wished to Get there<br/>
before you !!! But when I did, the few times, I missed reading your<br/>
notes. Happy Trails and thanks for all the pleasure you have given me.'<br/>

&gt; Before this thread gets really going, as we all know it will !! <br/>
<br/>
It shouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let me throw in my congrats.  The thing about Pete and Wanda is<br/>
that they find the hard ones also.  They've found alot of the ones I've<br/>
placed, which takes alot of time, effort, and smarts.  Anyone going <br/>
strictly for numbers would blow my boxes off in a heartbeat (not that,<br/>
IMO, there is anything wrong with going strictly for numbers -- hitting<br/>
goals makes people feel good -- and feeling good is healthy and a good <br/>
thing to do).<br/>
<br/>
