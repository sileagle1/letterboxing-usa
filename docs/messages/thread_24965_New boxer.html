                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the welcome Dave. Kingston also is a SERIOUS place for geocaching too. I just started geocaching December 2007 and just reached 1300 finds. It will take me considerably longer to find that many letterboxes and will surely need a sugar daddy to fund my FINDS ...lol lol<br/>
I am enjoying the NON-COMPETITIVENESS of letterboxing and the ARTISTRY of the stamps. I hope to ask SANTA for an art set and then place some in and around this fair city. With the mojo about hides and geocaching I hope to bring some FUN and stealth to my hides as well as the journey and the possible story to enfold as people search. It may take me some months to reach this level but I am setting a goal to find 100 boxes.<br/>
Let the addiction...er...I meant...the pastime...begin.<br/>
Cheers<br/>

  Hi Skyedog! Welcome to the addiction! Kingston is a great area to be a new boxer -- there are plenty of good boxes nearby. You should also make sure you join the Ontario boxing list so you can keep in touch with what's going on in the area. Check it out at <br/>

That's amazing.  I've been letterboxing 11 months now, and have <br/>
searched for 14, having successfully found only 7 of those.  I'm doing <br/>
it with kids in tow, and only once every couple of months, so maybe we <br/>
are in different places in life (let alone the globe!).  Welcome to <br/>
letterboxing, Skyedog -- glad you've found such a special hobby.  We <br/>
really enjoy it, too.<br/>
