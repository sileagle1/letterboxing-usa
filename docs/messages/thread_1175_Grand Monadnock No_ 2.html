rock pile, and couldn't resist planting another letterbox. The first <br/>
had a tongue-in-cheek note from an "accidental" visitor that <br/>
said, "hide it better or it'll disapear, from The Park Ranger." <br/>
Here's new clues should you care for some steep climbing.<br/>

Grand Monadnock No. 1<br/>
September 5, 1999<br/>
<br/>
On Mount Monadnock in Jaffrey, New Hampshire, there are as many <br/>
interesting ways to summit as there are people climbing. Pick a <br/>
favorite, and from the summit descend on the Pumpelly Trail, past the <br/>
Red Dot, to the Sarcophagus, called by some "The Boat."<br/>
