Connecticut Letterboxes Re-Evaluated<br/>
<br/>
	Letterboxing is a new and exciting pastime that is taking <br/>
America by storm.<br/>
	In a recent survey, it was found that the average  "F-count" or <br/>
"Letterboxes Found" rating of all residents of the State of <br/>
Connecticut is 40 (F40).  <br/>
	"The damned things are everywhere," said Arnold Tewkesbury <br/>
of Danbury, "I broke 2 lawnmower blades on `em just this <br/>
summer."<br/>
	"I found 7 of them friggin' boxes walkin' my dog this morning," <br/>
said Garth Antriem of Farmginton.  "My wife tripped on a letterbox <br/>
last week at the Beauty Parlour and sprained her ankle.  I wanna <br/>
know who I can sue.  My lawyer says he can't subpoena <br/>
somebody named, `The Amazing Box Hound'."<br/>
	"They're like the Tribbles from Star Trek.  We can't open up <br/>
parks and recreation areas fast enough to hold all of the new <br/>
boxes.  Wal-Mart has been sold out of Rubbermaid for weeks, <br/>
and I can't find a zip-lock freezer bag to save my life," says Aretha <br/>
Geltstein of Bethel.<br/>
	Letterboxing Organizers are concerned for the health of the <br/>
sport.  "It's inflation, pure and simple,"  says one Pennsylvania <br/>
letterboxer, who identified himself only as The Great and <br/>
Powerful Wizard of Pink Stuff.  "You cant swing a dead cat in <br/>
Connecticut without hitting 2 or 3 letterboxes.  People in <br/>
Tennessee are having a tough time keeping up.  They have to <br/>
hide boxes from themselves and drink to forget where they put <br/>
them.  In Connecticut you have babies coming out of the womb <br/>
with F2 counts."<br/>
	To compensate for the inflated "F" counts, organizers have <br/>
instituted a new "3/5ths" rule.  Effective immediately and <br/>
retroactively all boxes found in the State of Connecticut are <br/>
counted as 3/5ths of a box toward your "F-count."<br/>
	"It was quite a negotiation," reported letterboxer, "Giggling Mist", <br/>
"New Englanders were asking for 9/10ths and the Nebraska <br/>
contingent wanted 3/16ths.  Somehow we hashed it out."<br/>
	Letterboxers are asked to turn in their patches for re-evaluation.  <br/>
New patches will be issued as soon as the organizers <br/>
determine if the new patches will be in decimal or fraction <br/>
format.  They expect a decision in early `06.<br/>
