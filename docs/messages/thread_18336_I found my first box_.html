I know that boards have certain ways to post everything, so if I am <br/>
doing something wrong, let me know please. I haven't used yahoo for <br/>

<br/>
Now on to what I came here for!<br/>
<br/>
I learned about letterboxing about a week ago and became very <br/>
excited. Emough so that I went out and got a stamp carving kit, made <br/>
my stamp and set out today to find the box nearest to my house. I <br/>
was so thrilled to find it! I can't wait to go looking for more in <br/>
the area.<br/>
<br/>
Question: Do most of you who hide boxes find out if the property you <br/>
are placing them on allows it first? I know there are tons of <br/>
geocaching (sp?) things in my area, so does that mean that it is <br/>
okay to hide boxes there? I would probably check first, but in parks <br/>
where there isn't anyone to ask, what would I do? Call the city?<br/>
<br/>
I also got an email today for a photography meetup and realized I <br/>
should check meetup.com to see if any letterboxers have signed up in <br/>
my area. Sadly, I am the only one. Do many of you use this site to <br/>
arrange meetings in the letterboxing community? Just curious.<br/>
<br/>
As you can tell, I am very longwinded.<br/>

This topic has been hashed and rehashed on this board, but since you <br/>
have no way to know that except go back through the archives, here <br/>
is a quick answer from MY perspective. Letterboxes should not be <br/>
placed on private property with out permission. Letterboxes should <br/>
not be placed in National Parks or National Monuments due to NPS <br/>
regulations. I consider parks,open areas,BLM land,Forest Service <br/>
areas, public property all fair game. I ask for forgiveness rather <br/>
than ask for permission. You might have listed the general area <br/>
where you are and you might have other letterboxers in that area. If <br/>
there are no other letterboxers in your area, "Plant them and they <br/>
will come".<br/>

The good thing about Letterboxing is there are no rules ;o). Post <br/>
where and when you need to everyone here is very helpful. <br/>
National Parks are a big NO-NO (well just don't post your clues if <br/>
you do[search archives for Nat. Prk.]).  Some state parks are ok <br/>
you'll need to ask.  What state are you in?  Gatherings happen <br/>
everywhere just watch the list for one near you.  We just had our <br/>
first Louisaina-Mississippi Event, check the photos area.<br/>

It took me a little bit to start carving stamps, but now I'm over the worries about not being very good at it.  I'm still not particularly GOOD, but I'm over the worries :)  If you end up with a hailstorm on Saturday and no great ideas of where to plant a letterbox, you can always make hitchhikers, too!<br/>

<br/>
I literally never even heard of letterboxing this time this past Friday <br/>
night...learned about it as I was researching geocaching for a <br/>
character in a book I'm writing. I wanted to experience it first hand, <br/>
but didn't want to invest the money in a handheld GPS because we have <br/>
GPS in our cars already. And then I stumbled on letterboxing. I already <br/>
had all of the equipment I needed, so it was a no-brainer! =)<br/>
<br/>
And to be quite honest, letterboxing actually fits the character's <br/>
personality better than geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for this great community and all the cool stuff I'm <br/>
learning about letterboxing. It is giving both my hiking and my <br/>
journaling a whole new dimension. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Week!<br/>
