Subject: [LbNA-WM] Letterboxes on Open Space<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jefferson County Open Space has seen a large increase in geocaching and<br/>
letterboxing.  Unfortunately, some of the sites are in sensitive areas<br/>
or in areas that have seasonal closures.  While we do allow placement of<br/>
caches and letterboxes, site owners must apply for and receive a special<br/>
activity permit prior to placing anything on Open Space property.  Your<br/>
website lists several letterboxes that do not have permits.  Is there a<br/>
way for you to contact the placers and ask them to contact Jefferson<br/>
County Open Space to get a permit?  While most the sites would be<br/>
approved, all letterboxes without permits will have to be removed.  The<br/>
following is a list of the sites without permits...<br/>
<br/>
Zeke's Letterbox<br/>
Soar Feet<br/>
Rain Cloud<br/>
Wheel of the Year - Litha<br/>
Deer Creek<br/>
Stick Deer<br/>
Homesteader Trail<br/>
White Ranch Park<br/>
<br/>
Your assistance in contacting the placers is appreciated.<br/>

You are absolutely right, (although not a very MEAN pirate at the <br/>
moment). At any rate this list includes some of our earliest (besides <br/>
Drewclan) and most beloved boxes. I am pretty sure they will be <br/>
permitted rather than pulled. As you say, the fact that they <br/>
contacted Wes leads me to believe they are willing to work with us.<br/>
