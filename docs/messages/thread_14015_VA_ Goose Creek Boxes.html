the Letter Boxing Community. Found the gully and the big rock 18 <br/>
steps off the trail so believe we were in the right spot. We could <br/>
see where water had recently flowed around both sides of the rock so <br/>
the box may have washed away. This was our first failed attempt!<br/>
<br/>
Rusted Butterfly was high and dry. It had been more than a month <br/>
since the last visitor so there was lots of rain that may have <br/>
gotten Pillar. It was like Grand Central Station though. We waited <br/>
and waited for a party to move on. They had to thoroughly examine <br/>
the ruins and finally concluded it must have been a pumping station <br/>
for pumping water up the hill. There were pipes leading from it up <br/>
the hill so perhaps they are correct. As soon as they moved off <br/>
another group stopped to look. The instant they moved on I sprinted <br/>
up the hill and back down with the box. Another group descended on <br/>
us while we were stamping up and I managed to smudge the beautiful <br/>
stamp in both log books by hurrying and closing the books and <br/>
throwing everything back into my bag.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had asked someone about these before setting off, but I saw <br/>
the words "easy" and "one mile round trip" and thought "I can do <br/>
that." What it actually said was "easy hike" and I was thinking easy <br/>
stroll. Well, it wasn't a stroll. And to make it worse, try as I <br/>
might, I could not ford the second gully at the trail -- too wide <br/>
and slippery for me. I was forced to go upsteam a ways and find an <br/>
easier crossing. Just another example of one man's easy being <br/>
someone else's challenge.<br/>
