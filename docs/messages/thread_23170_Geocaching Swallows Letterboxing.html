Please join me in asking Jeremy not to do this. Post him here and on the  <br/>
groundspeak forums. It would be okay if geocaching didn't improve  letterboxing <br/>
with a website that solves issues with our boxes. It would be  alright if this <br/>
little tiny thing stayed independent of the gigantic geocaching  community. <br/>
They've already got geocaching, benchmarking, waymarking, geocoining,  plenty of <br/>
other goodies to  control and make money on. We could  continue without their <br/>
taking us over, but only if they let us.<br/>

what are the issues cachers are having with hybrid<br/>

with a gps unit this past Christmas but I have yet to use it for<br/>
geo-anything.  I am intrigued with geodashing and benchmark hunting as I<br/>
have found a couple along the way to letterboxes.  But I am not interested<br/>
in geocaching.  There is plenty of room in the world and internet for each<br/>
to independently coexist.  Why do the geocaching folks feel a need to<br/>
expand their realm into letterboxing?  What needs are not being met by the<br/>
current letterboxing websites?  If it is inevitable, I foresee a movement<br/>
to obscure letterboxing.  I am already planning more difficult clues for<br/>
future boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't able to access the link provided, and I don't know the full<br/>
context of the comments quoted, so I'd love to hear Jeremy post something<br/>
here.  If they are only working on geocache/letterbox hybrid issues, I<br/>
don't know that I would be so concerned.  I don't go out of my way to hunt<br/>
hybrids.  But if they branched into all the other letterboxing forms, I<br/>
wouldn't support it.  <br/>
<br/>
Might I suggest Jeremy create a poll or polls to get the letterboxing<br/>
community's opinion before they move foreward with any plans?  Education<br/>
is better than ignorance.<br/>

Here's another controversial topic for us. Rumor has it that Jeremy (the  <br/>
chief of geocaching.com and a member of this list) is planning on creating a<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing website. A few details are at<br/>

See  post#15 in this thread:<br/>
"Actually we're working on a letterboxing site. It  may<br/>
help solve some issues with the current hybrids. We'll<br/>
see."<br/>
<br/>
Please join me in asking Jeremy not to do this. Post him here and on the  <br/>
groundspeak forums. It would be okay if geocaching didn't improve <br/>
letterboxing <br/>
with a website that solves issues with our boxes. It would be  alright if<br/>
this <br/>
little tiny thing stayed independent of the gigantic geocaching  community. <br/>
They've already got geocaching, benchmarking, waymarking, geocoining, <br/>
plenty of <br/>
other goodies to  control and make money on. We could  continue without<br/>
their <br/>
taking us over, but only if they let us.<br/>
<br/>
Jeremy, please don't do it!<br/>

about hybrids<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First,  all too often the stamp is missing-despite the placers best efforts<br/>
to identify it as part of the box and not a tradable item<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Second, the placement and clues tend to be quite different.  It Is not<br/>
unusual to find a hybrid box with the clues being the coordinates of a<br/>
drainage ditch and the  clue  "start turning over rocks".  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cachers often have different mindsets and motivations-many don't understand<br/>
why a hand carved stamp placed in a single, unique location is more<br/>
appealing than a series of store bought stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I happen to live in an area with a very active geocaching organization<br/>
(SWOGO) that has worked very hard to find ways for  all the related hobbies<br/>
to  coexist together  They do a lot of good things, such as cache in trash<br/>
out events, etc.  They sponsor some pretty  large events, and try to find<br/>
clever ways to integrate several hobbies (geocaching, letterboxing and<br/>
orienteering, for example).  Yet, despite the best efforts,(and some of them<br/>
are darn good!!)  I still prefer the letterboxing community to be discreet.<br/>
We have a different focus and a different expectation.  When I meet someone<br/>
who like caching, I refer them to  caching sites.  I wish  cachers would<br/>
return the courtesy.<br/>

<br/>
In considering the problem of geocachers taking over letterboxing it<br/>
occurs to her Ladyship that the problem lies with those in our ranks<br/>
who have created the hybrid box. If we don't list our letterboxes on<br/>
geocache sites and remain independent of them it would cut down on<br/>
geocachers looking for letterboxes. If we don't list coordinates in<br/>
our clues then it seems less likely that geocachers would take the<br/>
time to sort out our annoyingly old-fashioned clues. Do we really want<br/>
geocachers leaving their flotsam and detritus in our boxes? It seems<br/>
obvious that if we stop listing boxes on geocache sites and don't<br/>
create hybrids then there would be far less incentive for geochachers<br/>
to attempt to take over and make us play by their rules. We can be<br/>
cooperative and yet remain distinct. We can cross check locations to<br/>
avoid planting in geocache sites but it would be naive to think that<br/>
we are going to get the newbie or casual or stubborn geocacher to<br/>
respect our rules, as it would also be naive to believe that we are<br/>
going to get the newbie or casual or stubborn letterboxer to respect<br/>
their rules. So continued intermixing seems likely to result<br/>
letterboxers being frustrated by missing stamps and geocachers<br/>
experiencing what ever frustration it is that they have with<br/>
letterboxers finding their geocaches.<br/>

creation of hybrid boxes is the root of the integration.  Some people <br/>
enjoy both hobbies and see this as a great way to participate in <br/>
both, but it does encourage homogeneousness.  To some this is good, <br/>
to some it is not, everyone has their own interests.<br/>
<br/>
As far as a letterboxing site created by Groundspeak -- just because <br/>
they create it, doesn't mean letterboxers have to use it.  If we as a <br/>
letterboxing community truly want to keep separation between the two <br/>
hobbies, it is within our ability to do that simply by not supporting <br/>
or utilizing a letterboxing site created by and affiliated with <br/>
Groundspeak -- and by not continuing to marry the two hobbies by <br/>
planting hybrid boxes.<br/>

It's bad enough that folks feel obligated to use this format (the web)<br/>
for letterboxing in the first place, we certainly don't need to pander<br/>
to them and create a hybrid. I think that letterboxing as a<br/>
hobby/sport/historic passtime or whathaveyou lost something<br/>
fundamental in its very essence when clues got listed freeforall on<br/>
the web. This instant gratification, gotta have my clues<br/>

I learned a long time ago not to get uptight about what someone else <br/>
was doing (as in competition) as you have no control over that <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
There is a good possibility that some of the impetus for a different <br/>
type of letterbox site could have grown from discussions on this <br/>
list. There have been discussions regarding methods to post finders <br/>
logs on clue sheets(ala the geocaching site). Mainly <br/>
these 'suggestions' have been from new letterboxers wanting to <br/>
change the game and wanting different 'bells and whistles'. I think <br/>
the opposition to those changes may have advised something to the <br/>
order of, "leave LbNA the way it is, go start your own type of web <br/>
site." Maybe this rumor if it is true could be in response to those <br/>
sentiments. No, I'm not advocating any changes to LbNA, I like it <br/>
the way it was.<br/>
<br/>
I would think that Jeremy would be rather cautious in any attempts <br/>
that might do some harm to LbNA or to those placers that have clues <br/>
posted at LbNA. He has a commercial site that is obviously <br/>
successful and if not handled properly a new site could create more <br/>
problems than he bargained for. In business you don't want to tick <br/>
off a whole bunch of folks when thinking about a new venture.<br/>
While this discussion is interesting, it may have little to do with <br/>
any concepts even if those concepts are true.<br/>

100 hides), I would really hope that the geocaching website *not* try<br/>
to be all things for all people.  My letterboxing is very minimal<br/>
compared to geocaching, but I enjoy it for all that.  I have avoided<br/>
hybrid caches, and even refused to convert one of our hides into a<br/>
hybrid, prefering to not list it at all rather than make what we felt<br/>
were totally unnecessary changes to a hide that was really good the<br/>
way it was.  We are in the process of converting it into a letterbox:<br/>
a standard, normal LB, with no geo-component at all.<br/>
<br/>
So, for the record, I would encourage Jeremy Irish and the rest of<br/>
Groundspeak to consider deleting the hybrid category from geocaching<br/>
(they have deleted locationless caches, and are not approving any new<br/>
virtuals, so there is precedence), rather than try to "compete" with<br/>
standard letterboxing.  I can definitely see some of the problems that<br/>
Jeremy refered to, however, and they are real.  The easiest way to<br/>
take care of the problem is to eliminate it.<br/>
<br/>
As for some of the concerns voiced about geocachers deliberately<br/>
looking for letterboxes to plunder them, I do not think that that is<br/>
likely.  Geocaching couldn't take over all the current LBs, as they<br/>
don't have a lat-lon co-ordinate to post.  As Jeremy expressed it,<br/>
there are problems with the peculiar hybrid form of the geocache, and<br/>
(as was done with locationless caches) I think they are wanting to<br/>
make a seperate section just for hybrid caches.  Those who only LB<br/>
have little to worry about, as long as they don't plant a box on top<br/>
of a geocache.  As I've written before on at least one of these<br/>
groups, the key is for geocachers and letterboxers to get to know each<br/>
other a little better, if only so that we understand each other.  As I<br/>
do both, I have a bit of a headstart in that, I guess :-)  The thing<br/>
that is so great about each of them (and geodashing fits in, too) is<br/>
that they take me places that I probably wouldn't have gone to,<br/>
otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, someone asked, "What needs are not being met by the current<br/>
letterboxing websites?"  Well, that's a loaded question.  Any<br/>
particular response will, of necessity, be reflective of one's<br/>
experience.  For myself, I would really like to see more editorial<br/>
control/influence over the listings.  I was out just yesterday in Red<br/>
Rock Canyon SP, a couple of hours north of Los Angeles.  My main focus<br/>
was geodashing; there is a dashpoint in the northern end of the park.<br/>
 I also grabbed two benchmarks and a geocache.  Then I hiked in Hagen<br/>
Canyon and attempted the two letterboxes there.  I got one; it was<br/>
definitely the easier of the two to figure out, although after last<br/>
year's rains, the trail is not at all easy to follow in spots.  The<br/>
other... well, when one has gone eastward as far as one can go into a<br/>
box canyon, and found the dry waterfall, how can one go eastward 60<br/>
paces?  Straight up 150 foot basalt cliffs?!  I think not.  And where<br/>
is the "saddle", mentioned as being on the left?  I've not yet<br/>
communicated with the owners, so there is a fair chance that I<br/>
completely mis-read a clue, or was in the wrong box canyon (doubt that<br/>
last, though).  The LB moderators could at least review each new LB<br/>
for clues that at least make a modicum of sense.  When standing at a<br/>
spot, if two landmarks are to the N and NE, if one goes eastward,<br/>
those landmarks *cannot* move to the south!  I know that they cannot<br/>
get everything, but I think they could make a stab at it.  I also<br/>
really wish that the site would post logs from those who have found a<br/>
box.  It would be very helpful if there was an *easy* (OK, I'll<br/>
acquiesce: easier) way to find out when a box was last hunted for, or<br/>
found.  This is something that geocaching and geodashing do very well,<br/>
and there is really no good reason for LB not to do the same.  And if<br/>
money is an issue (come on, folks!  I have seen lots of .org and .net<br/>
sites that ask for donations and/or payments, and plenty of .com ones<br/>
that did not, so that's a dumb complaint), I have no problem making a<br/>
donation to the LbNA site.  They could always add a link for such to<br/>
the page that has the links for decals and patches and labels and such<br/>
that we can buy.  Hey, lookee, there!  They sell things.  I guess no<br/>
one is pure ;-)<br/>

really rather not see comments by previous finders that might influence our<br/>
own efforts.  I don't mind seeing an "Attempted" status, but we don't take<br/>
it as an indication that a box is definitely missing, it just makes a<br/>
possible find that much more satisfying.<br/>

  The best way to learn about this hobby in the US is to read the history yourself. If you look at the messages, starting from October of 1998 you will see who the founders of this hobby were. Also Mark Pepe has a wonderful video on his website of the very first Letterbox gathering showing the people who worked so hard to make this great hobby what it is today. As early as Nov. 1998 the founders were working on a website to share information. In the words of Daneil Servatius:<br/>
<br/>
  "The way I see it there are two separate, but necessary sentiments among our<br/>
members.  One is the yearning to see the hobby grow both in number of people<br/>
involved and in number of letterboxes available to find.  The other sentiment is<br/>
that we present information to people in a way that makes it easy for them to<br/>
learn about letterboxing and to become involved, thereby helping to fulfill the<br/>
first sentiment."<br/>
<br/>
  In Dartmoor the clues are published in a catalog that you can only get once you have found 100 boxes, I believe. But they usually do not carve thier own stamps, they have them made. Image how cranky some of our carvers here in the US would be if we decided to do it exactly like Dartmoor? <br/>

<br/>
Hikers-n-Hounds had a great suggestion, reading up on the history of<br/>
this fascinating hobby will only serve to continue the legacy. But,<br/>
it's more than that. I have come to realize that the most wonderful<br/>
facets of letterboxing are the unspoken, unwritten, unpublished<br/>
nuances that can only be learned through finding other people's boxes,<br/>
and through time and some perseverance.  <br/>
<br/>
When I first stumbled across this notion there were very few boxes to<br/>
be found, but the ones that were in existence set the stage for the<br/>
future. The rest was history as they say. Once I found some of the<br/>
early boxes in Maine, I knew that I had something to contribute,<br/>
special places that I wanted to share with those who were willing to<br/>
take the time to listen and to walk the same paths through my eyes and<br/>
words and see it in the carvings that I shared. I was willing to share<br/>
a part of myself with a larger community of people. <br/>
<br/>
Now that our community is growing so much larger, it is important to<br/>
step back and reflect on the elements that make letterboxing so<br/>
interesting. It's not the number of boxes that makes it interesting to<br/>
me, it's the way in which others have chosen to create art or to share<br/>
their experience with others. It's a sort of modern storytelling in a<br/>
way. However, there is still a chance to preserve the art of<br/>
storytelling through words and images before it is translated into a<br/>
completely electronic form. Use your imagination on that, but remember<br/>
to honour the ones who came before you because they have truly blazed<br/>
the path. Now it is your turn to make history.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;What needs are not being met by the current letterboxing websites?  <br/>
<br/>
The only thing I have a complaint about the LbNA and it really isn't a<br/>
complaint, more like a feature I'd love to see; an easy way to use a PDA.<br/>
<br/>
It would be very easy to implement, just a print-friendly list with<br/>
links that go directly to print-friendly clues.  Simple.  I can set my<br/>
reader to collect those pages and off I go.  (I'm very disorganized<br/>
when it comes to using paper.  The paper print-outs end up in the<br/>
floorboard or tucked between the seats, and then I can't find them.)<br/>
<br/>
You know Jeremy is going to offer that--for a fee--just like for<br/>
geocaches.<br/>
<br/>
A bit more complicated version of my suggestion is one that lists the<br/>
clues under sub-directories based on county or city.  This way, if I'm<br/>
in Columbia, I can look up boxes near Columbia without wading through<br/>
the other boxes.  (BTW, I can help with that if you want.)<br/>
<br/>
As for logs on boxes, while I plan on offering such on my privately<br/>
listed boxes, I don't see that it is necessary.  My solution isn't so<br/>
much logs, but feedback or comments kind of like a blog. The real<br/>
issue I see with logs is whether the box is still there or not.  I<br/>
think this is mostly a hold-over from geocaching where most want a<br/>
slam-dunk find.  There, knowing that the cache is still there is<br/>
important because of the accuracy of the GPS unit and general lack of<br/>
end-game guidance.  This results in destruction of the area as<br/>
overzealous searchers try every possible hiding place until the cache<br/>
is found.  This is rarely the case in letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, I really don't see Groundspeak gaining much traction<br/>
because they are going to want to charge for the use of some of the<br/>
features. That's not to mention they will want to "review" the box<br/>
before "approving" its listing.  Me, I want to get my clues out to<br/>
folks unencumbered with fees and the like.<br/>
<br/>
I see other hurdles for Groundspeak to overcome before gaining traction.<br/>
<br/>
My concern is the migration of geocachers into the letterboxing world<br/>
without the benefit of the indocrination that letterboxers typically<br/>
get.  (I see that as a problem in the geocaching world itself, but I<br/>
am routinely ignored when I bring it up.)  I don't see a problem with<br/>
Groundspeak coming into the letterboxing world, I see the problem of<br/>
the users Groundspeak will bring to the letterboxing world.<br/>

&gt; ...The suggestion letterboxes can be moderated is suggesting that <br/>
&gt; the moderators would possess the ability to judge them by some <br/>
&gt; predetermined criteria... <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Letterboxes are as individual as the letterboxers who place them...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ... "it's not Just About the Prize."  If that is the motivation to <br/>
&gt; seek a cache/letterbox, then something important has been<br/>
&gt; lost.  For me, it's about the journey and discovery.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looking over the responses to my previous post, I can see that I'm in<br/>
a distinct minority, and I'll accept that.  The above seems to<br/>
best-encapsulate the general trend of replies, so let me say only a<br/>
couple of things, and then I'll shut up until I gain enough experience<br/>
to press my points better.  Which might never happen ;-)<br/>
<br/>
First off, it is always about the journey.  In writing to the owners<br/>
of Dry Waterfall, I made a point to thank them for showing me a place<br/>
that I would likely never have visited without them showing it to me.<br/>
 The best caches and boxes and whatnot are those which take us to neat<br/>
places that we wouldn't likely find on our own.<br/>
<br/>
Still, "the Prize" must have some value, else why carry around a<br/>
personal stamp and log and all that?  We seek the letterbox in order<br/>
to find it, right?  If not, then why keep track at all?  Nestled in<br/>
amongst the posts on this thread are a few about some letterboxers who<br/>
are getting close to 10,000 finds.  Amazing!!  But if the numbers mean<br/>
nothing (as implied by the above statement that if the motivation for<br/>
seeking a box is to find it, then that's the wrong motivation), then<br/>
why hide the thing in the first place?  Just post a few simple<br/>
directions and say, "Neat place, huh?" at the end of the directions. <br/>
Let us be honest about this: the prize *is* the reason for the hunt. <br/>
What we see along the way *should* often be more important than the<br/>
actual find, but we can't know that until we actually get there.  And<br/>
the find is the "validation" that we found the right place.<br/>
<br/>
I love the format of letterboxing.  I love doing puzzle caches, too,<br/>
which are the rough geocaching equivalent of the obscure directions to<br/>
many LBs.  My complaint is that there are times when the clues, no<br/>
matter how you look at them, do not make sense.  Physical<br/>
impossibilities in clues serve no purpose.  Either the clues are<br/>
poorly written, or else an actual error has been made.  Perhaps there<br/>
is no solution to this.  But denying the problem isn't going to work,<br/>
either.  And making clues even more obtuse than the "obtusest" of them<br/>
already are is only going to make things less attractive.  Of course,<br/>
perhaps that's what the die-hard LBer wants.  If so, I'll never be a<br/>
die-hard.  But that's OK.  There is enough at the lower ends of this<br/>
hobby to keep me happy :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for your patience with my posts on this.  Your responses<br/>
were direct, thoughtful and without rancor.  Which is, alone,<br/>
sufficient reason for me to keep letterboxing :-)  If there is one<br/>
thing about geocaching that really irks me, it is that there are some<br/>
yay-hoos who think that a flame is the only way to respond to a<br/>
comment with which they disagree.  I've yet to see a flame-throwing<br/>
letterboxer :-D<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I'm sure this does happen sometimes, just as I know that geocaches as occasionally posted with incorrect coordinates, but it would be very difficult for an overseeing body to realize such erros without physically checking out all clues, which just is not feasible.<br/>
<br/>
I really think it happens less often than you may think.  I consider myself a fairly capable letterboxer in terms of figuring out some of the more cryptic clues, but still I cannot count the times that I have been frustrated because I got to a point in the clues where it was just a physical impossibility.  I recall a time that to follow the indicated bearing and paces would have required me walk a fair distance out into Lake Michigan.  In the majority of those situations going back to an earlier point in the clue and thinking outside my original line, often revealed another solution.  One thing about letterboxing that you do not encounter with geocaching via coordinates is that clues can often be made to fit your surroundings based on your focus.  Because of this, it is not unusual to misinterpret the intent of the clue and end up in the wrong place even though you appear to have followed everything verbatim.  This is not usually an intentional misleading or even an attempt to be obtuse on the part of the clue-writer, simply difference in human perspective.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And making clues even more obtuse than the "obtusest" <br/>
&gt; of them already are is only going to make things less <br/>
&gt; attractive.  <br/>
<br/>
I daresay you might find a fair number of letterboxers who disagree with this statement.  There are those who hunt only mystery boxes and likewise those who create only this type of box.  Were Mapsurfer to release clues to a new letterbox today along the same lines as his previous cryptic/puzzling/obtuse clues, I would bet there would be a lot of people burning the midnight oil trying to figure that thing out tonight.<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about letterboxing is that there is enough flexibility in the loose structure of the *rules* that each person can play their way, choosing and planting boxes that are of interest to them, and invariable no matter what type of box that is, obtuse clues or driveby directions, there are many other letterboxers who will be interested in finding it.<br/>

 &gt; They've already got geocaching, benchmarking, waymarking, geocoining,<br/>

and far in between, more power to you, just stop using the system that <br/>
is set up online.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, if American letterboxing were anything like Dartmoor <br/>
letterboxing, I think I would be bored out of my mind.<br/>

Somethings are better left unsaid, and everything you've said today <br/>
qualifies.  Perhaps you need to go back to bed and try getting up on <br/>
the other side next time.<br/>
<br/>
Why can't you respect the fact that opinions other than yours are <br/>
just as valid. <br/>
<br/>
Or here's an idea, if you don't like reading other's opinions, create <br/>
a yahoogroup of your own and post there.  That would be, after all, <br/>
taking your own advice and we all wouldn't have to be subjected to <br/>

 &gt; Were Mapsurfer to release clues to a new letterbox<br/>
 &gt; today along the same lines as his previous<br/>
&gt; cryptic/puzzling/obtuse clues, I would bet there would<br/>
 &gt; be a lot of people burning the midnight oil trying to<br/>
 &gt; figure that thing out tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Hey :-)  Rumours of my demise have been greatly exaggerated ...<br/>
<br/>
I'm still here, I'm just operating well below the radar.<br/>
I'm disenchanted with what Yankee letterboxing has become<br/>
(as some of you know), and still play the same game I<br/>
fell in love with in '98, where the idea of a website<br/>
was simply an on-line print catalog, where words, not<br/>
website operators and functionality, define the game.<br/>
<br/>
If no one wants to play  with me, that's their loss, not<br/>
mine :-)  I do what I do, and I enjoy it.  I stay true<br/>
to my beliefs about how the game should be played, and<br/>
if I'm marginalized, so be it.<br/>
<br/>
Can't people who don't like the idea of Jeremy's prospective<br/>
letterboxing website simply ignore it?<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

<br/>
I think Randy just summed it up best.  The game has no rules.  Sure, <br/>
there is some etiquette, but there are no rules as to how it is played. <br/>
  We all do things differently.  Randy does his thing, I do my thing, <br/>
you do your thing, and Jeremy does his thing.  SO WHAT!  They live or <br/>
die on their own.<br/>
<br/>
There are a bunch of you houdy toudy types that think things should be <br/>
done your way.  You don't like any new ideas.  Well, that is just too <br/>
bad, new things are going to be tried, be it on the trail or on the <br/>
internet.  You are going to have to learn to live with it.  The whole <br/>
lot of you are crying over this new site idea, which you don't even <br/>
really know about.  The simple answer is right there in front of you, <br/>
just don't use it.  Keep doing your own thing, no one is stopping you. <br/>
Jeez, you folks just seem to need something to cry over, don't you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I stand by the Dartmoor comment.  Yeah, I know some folks don't <br/>
like that either.<br/>
<br/>
One other thing, I don't much care for Cherrios, more of a Raisin Bran <br/>
man myself.<br/>

Oh, I subscribe to the list purly for the entertainment value, I've said <br/>
so several times.<br/>
<br/>
I see someone come up with a new idea, or in this case, just the rumor <br/>
of something new, and the whole lot of you go screaming and yelling, and <br/>
in the end crying about it, and I just sit back a laugh.<br/>
<br/>
But, I figure every once in a while someone has to just say how stupid <br/>
you are being, and, well, I ain't much for tact.<br/>
<br/>
I read through this whole made up issue, and that what it is, it is all <br/>
in your minds, and I find it the same names that sit there and impune <br/>
it, say oh how terrible it is, cry out for Jeremy to please, please <br/>
don't create a letterboxing site, that there are already some many out <br/>
there, and how terrible it would be, and how evil it would be if he were <br/>
to make a buck on it, and all I can think is what a bunch of elitist, <br/>
stuck up snobs.  So, I figure I am going to say so, since no one else does.<br/>

  you know, im going to be completely honest with you. i may have had some problems with some of the people here on this message board, but i learned to understand that the veterans lend a voice for a reason. and that is for the best of letterboxing. letterboxing has evolved and everyone who contributes to this messageboard, except yourself, is trying to keep the art of letterboxing from becoming something it shouldn't be. that is screwed up by others who don't know what they are talking about or doing. you obviously haven't a clue and should not be here talking about how messed up you think we are. those flakes in your cereal bowl are getting soggy. kinda like your opinion here!<br/>
<br/>
  not crying here! Are you still amazed with yourself?<br/>

Wouldn't that be easier then trying to stop the development of other letterboxing databases or the changes in the current databases?<br/>

You might want to consider that once the groundspeak letterboxing site gets going perhaps LBNA can go back to the old 1998 format and those who prefer more features can move their clues to the new site. The new database may be a blessing in disguise. <br/>

This could very well be true.<br/>
<br/>
However, as I've stated before, and I may have not been clear, we do<br/>
not box in a vacuum.<br/>
<br/>
I'm an avid geocacher and "ignore the way others play" is not a way to<br/>
go.  What happens, no matter how you try to ignore the other players,<br/>
is  they interfere with YOUR play.  While I'm sure some folks won't<br/>
understand how that happens without it being explained to them, it's<br/>
the same with earlier geocachers.<br/>
<br/>
As I've said, my main concern is not the site itself, it's the<br/>
cross-over players.  Geocachers are going to come to the letterboxing<br/>
world with geocaching notions.  While the vast majority of geocachers<br/>
will be respectful of letterboxing decorum, I foresee enough who will<br/>
not to be a serious problem.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, the majority of those who use the Groundspeak boxing site<br/>
will not be pure letterboxers.  They will be geocachers first, boxers<br/>
second, and will have learned how to letterbox from Jeremy Irish.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so the more traditional boxers take their play to a less public<br/>
level.  You know Groudspeak will shout it from the rooftops.  The next<br/>
thing you know there will be many times the number of Groundspeak<br/>
letterboxers than traditional boxers.  "Might Makes Right" and that<br/>
will then go to Groundspeak.  You really want to see Jeremy Irish on<br/>
some show talking about HIS form of letterboxing?  That will happen if<br/>
the traditionists go underground.<br/>
<br/>
No, the sky is not falling.  But there IS trouble on the horizon.<br/>

You make very good points and sum it up very nicely. <br/>
<br/>
I think the real question becomes, then, what is the true definition <br/>
of letterboxing?  Don't we need to look at our history (both here and <br/>
Dartmoor) to help define it?  <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion/experience it's nothing like geocahcing, which is <br/>
centered on technology.  It's an entirely different game with an <br/>
entirely different focus.<br/>
<br/>
We've tried to use a technological tool to more easily carry <br/>
letterboxing to a greater audience, but does that distort what <br/>
letterboxing is about?  With the move to the underground by some of <br/>
our brightest and best players, that conclusion can be an easy one to <br/>
arrive at.<br/>
<br/>
Does this water down what is the true essence of the game when we try <br/>
to add more and more bells and whistles to satsify more people?  <br/>
<br/>
Should we satisfy more people?  Doesn't that change the game?  <br/>
<br/>
Can a geocacher add value to the game, or will it detract from it <br/>
(which I'm afraid it will)? Should we move to a model where our boxes <br/>
would have to be approved by someone else before we can place them? <br/>
<br/>
Is that really what this game is about?<br/>
<br/>
I would hope we all could think on these things and move away from <br/>
the childish name calling which accomplishes nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for bringing this up!<br/>

<br/>
I see letterboxing and geocaching as quite similar. At the essence they are both hide 'n seek games. Boxers and geocachers have the same goal, to find a hidden box. <br/>
<br/>
Geocachers seek it using lat/long coordinates and letterboxers seek the box using written directions. Both geocachers and letterboxers log their finds by noting their visit in a physical logbook. Geocachers write a note in the logbook, letterboxers stamp their signature stamp in the logbook. Most geocachers log their find online too, some letterboxers log their find online. <br/>

Granted we had moved past submitting the clues to a Yahoo group and placing all of the work for posting them onto a couple of webmasters, but other than that, it was pretty much as you describe -- just a simple website with lists of clues to print off.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps those who want bells and whistles and logging capabilities could create their own website and letterboxing.org could revert back to its simpler form.  Oh wait, Ryan already created that site -- AtlasQuest.  Now if we could just keep the powers that be at letterboxing.org from trying to keep pace with AtlasQuest, we'd be all set.  Two sites for two different groups of interest -- everyone is happy.<br/>

take a late night stroll along the river and basin, which is what I did <br/>
last night.  I stood there, leaning against a graffiti ridden <br/>
information sign along the basin, watching a ship slowly ply its way <br/>
down the river, and just contemplated things.<br/>
<br/>
Know what I came up with?  Well, I think what I said was dead on right. <br/>
  It may have not been tactful or graceful, but sometimes brute force is <br/>
what is needed.<br/>
<br/>
There are an awful lot of folks that don't see things even when they are <br/>
staring them in the face, and I think this is one of them.  This is <br/>
captialism at work.  If you don't like a site that has been created, <br/>
don't use it, there are many other ways to get clues out there, even <br/>
right here, use them.  Instead, I see things like this,<br/>
<br/>
"They will be geocachers first, boxers<br/>
second, and will have learned how to letterbox from Jeremy Irish."<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't know Jeremy, and have never done any Geocaching, but I <br/>
would think that if someone is going to go to all the trouble and <br/>
expense to set up a site on letterboxing then not explain anything about <br/>
it.  I think far too many people get far too emotional about changes in <br/>
the game.  Things are not always as they seem all the time.<br/>
<br/>
They don't understand the evolution, and further, they don't understand <br/>
that they don't have to evolve with it.  Set up your own site.  If you <br/>
want letterboxing to be very elitist, then make your version that way, <br/>
and I think that is what a bunch of you folks really seem to want.  So <br/>
go ahead, detach yourselves from the community, create your own site, <br/>
keep it a secret, give the clues only to those you want to have clues. <br/>
That is what some of you folks seem to want, so take the action, instead <br/>
of bemoaning and complaining about what Jeremy Irish might be doing.<br/>

Some people just need to get a clue.<br/>

Yes, some people do need to get a clue.<br/>
<br/>
First, you admit you know nothing about that which you speak then make<br/>
an assumption about it.<br/>
<br/>
What you "think" is irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I've always admired about the letterboxing community is its<br/>
indocrination of the new hobbyists.  That is something geocaching<br/>
lacks.  The community tries to do it, but when it is without the<br/>
"official sanction" of the site many times the community is ignored. <br/>
The letterboxing community goes to great pains to let new players know<br/>
what is expected of them.  In geocaching, you're given coordinates and<br/>
let loose.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, one would "think" as you do.  Reality is different story, though.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, now that the flames have dies down a bit...<br/>
<br/>
First, I'm not a newbie 'boxer. I've been boxing for a year and a<br/>
half. If there were more hours in the day (especially sunlight) and<br/>
more letterboxes nearby, I'd have a super-duper F-count (but would<br/>
anyone care?). (Personally, I think I lost rookie status after<br/>
trekking along the southeastern shore of Conanicut Island to find the<br/>
two boxes out there--and those were only #5 and #6--and gained veteran<br/>
status after one year and 100 Finds.)<br/>
<br/>
Now, I don't know Jeremy Irish (has anyone out there ever met him?<br/>
know what he looks like?), but I have found a couple of geocaches. I<br/>
don't have a GPS, though. One cache find was paced out, written down<br/>
and handed to me WOM by the cacher (who's also a 'boxer). One was so<br/>
easy to find it was ridiculous. The last was totally by accident at<br/>
Stone Mountain. I've also used the geocaching website to find and log<br/>
geodetic benchmarks and stuff. To ice this cake I'm building, I even<br/>
used the geocaching site's resources to track down a geocacher who<br/>
lives nearby a certain letterbox and who was kind enough to rescue it<br/>
from impending doom last year. He also replanted it after I sent it back. <br/>
<br/>
MORAL: Letterboxers and geocachers CAN live together in peace and can<br/>
benefit from each other's existence.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a letterboxing website. Two, in fact. One is my own and the<br/>
other is for my region. There are more letterboxing websites out there<br/>
than anyone can find with a Google search in one night. (That's only<br/>
because it's relatively easy to hide things from Google, and you don't<br/>
even have to know how...) <br/>
<br/>
So will another letterboxing site bother me? To be honest, it ruffled<br/>
my feathers a bit at first, but then I considered what I just said in<br/>
the above paragraph. If Irish wants to create a site for hybrids, let<br/>
him get it done. It won't bother me... unless...<br/>
<br/>
... the only time I (or any of you out there) should have a legitimate<br/>
problem with Irish's site is if:<br/>
<br/>
1. site users begin publishing clues to letterboxes that are not<br/>
theirs, just to log a find.<br/>
<br/>
2. the site's content features an official "rulebook" for letterboxing<br/>
AND those rules break the rules that we all know "don't exist" but are<br/>
there to guide us, nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
3. clues to geoboxes mention, describe, or otherwise jeopardize a<br/>
traditional letterbox that does not belong to the geoboxer.<br/>
<br/>
Now THAT's the kind of response we 'boxers need to provide. A<br/>
clear-cut, sane, non-emotional list of strong suggestions for keeping<br/>
the peace while maintaining creative avenues.<br/>

<br/>
As I and others have mentioned earlier, there is a *definite* reason<br/>
for actually wanting to mention if a letterbox is near a geocache, and<br/>
vice versa.  Mentioning that there is a pre-existing letterbox nearby<br/>
(say, within 100 feet/30 meters) to a geocache, or a pre-existing<br/>
geocache to a letterbox, will make it that much more likely that those<br/>
hunting for the one will not mistake the other for the one.  Having<br/>
found my first LB while searching for a geocache, I know only too well<br/>
how easy it can be to mistake one for the other, especially if neither<br/>
the LBer nor the cacher know of the other's existence, and if the box<br/>
and/or cache aren't well labeled, both of which were the case in my<br/>
example.  I knew that I had found a letterbox, but the five people<br/>
before me had not.  As much as some people hate the techno-route, it<br/>
cannot be ignored that it is popular.  Hiding from it won't help anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Thus, proper labeling of our boxes is important.  I also feel really<br/>
strongly that, if an LBer knows that a geocache is within 100 feet of<br/>
an existing geocache, they should at least mention the fact that the<br/>
general area has at least one geocache in it, so practice even more<br/>
stealth than normal.  And I think that any geocacher who hides a cache<br/>
within a 100 feet or so of a known LB has an obligation to warn all<br/>
cachers, in the cache write-up, that there is a letterbox within the<br/>
same general area, and to be sure not to mistake it for the cache. <br/>
Giving any information about the LB would *definitely* be a no-no, but<br/>
not mentioning it at all would, IMHO, be immoral, or at least<br/>
questionable ethics.  As you say, we can co-exist, and we both are<br/>
proof of it.  Anything we each can do to help and protect the other is<br/>
even better :-)<br/>

I totally agree with you. In trying to keep my statements short and sweet after rambling on <br/>
and on and occasionally losing my train of thought, I left out some crucial info.<br/>
<br/>
Allow me to restate item #3...<br/>
<br/>
3. clues to geoboxes mention a specific letterbox by name, describe an LBX's hiding spot, <br/>
or paraphrase the clues to an LBX or utilize and LBX's hiding spot as part of the clues to <br/>
the geoboxes<br/>
<br/>
Your prose leads to a fourth statement:<br/>
<br/>
4. geoboxes (and geocaches) planted within eyesight or a hundred feet or so of a <br/>
*preexisting* letterbox should have listed, within their clues, that "a letterbox is nearby" <br/>
(notice, no name or spoiler) and that nothing is traded nor left in letterboxes other than <br/>
stamp impressions and log entries<br/>
<br/>
Dadgummit, I'd better stop! It sounds like I'm writing a rule book! <br/>

It's time to take a breather. This thread should end if nothing<br/>
constructive can be said. These personal attacks must stop!<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly, this is a hobby. Everyone is entitled to<br/>
their own opinion. That's how this list was built. Read the early<br/>
records. Even they disagreed but never resorted to name calling.<br/>
<br/>
Furthering the idea of elitism and "houdy toudy" types does nothing<br/>
constructive. Every time a flame appears, we loose more letterboxers<br/>
who don't want to deal with this.<br/>
<br/>
If you can't write something respectful, then please do not post at all.<br/>

<br/>
I've labeled all but the first two of my plants with "THIS IS NOT A GEOCACHE" in permanent <br/>
marker on the inside of the transparent cover. More recent boxes have this statement in <br/>
numerous places. And I STILL find trinkets and stuff in a few of them...<br/>

&gt; same general area, and to be sure not to mistake it for the cache. <br/>
<br/>
Too cool. I thought of this, too, then thought... in many cases, it's very hard for a <br/>
letterboxer to know that there's a geocache nearby. Remember, we're not usually carrying <br/>
those handy-dandy GPS units around. (Aside: I want one, not so I can geocache, <br/>
necessarily, but just because the technology is cool.)<br/>
<br/>
Planters in "uncharted" areas may not know of geocaches when they're out a-planting, and <br/>
may not ever know unless someone, a Finder or cacher, tells them.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would be wise to just amend our clues (for letterboxes, geocaches and <br/>
everything in-between) with a disclaimer such as, "Remember, there's other things out in <br/>
these here woods besides letterboxes/geocaches!"<br/>
