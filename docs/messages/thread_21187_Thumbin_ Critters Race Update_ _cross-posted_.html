Sorry for the cross-post...<br/>
<br/>
I know it is cold and unboxable in many areas right now, but a few of <br/>
the racers have made it to the East coast, and I thought it warranted <br/>
an update!<br/>
<br/>
Many of you know that Pink Pig won the race a few months back and the <br/>
Gold Trophy PLB prize has made the rounds to those that carried her <br/>
to victory. But there is still the Silver Cup PLB for second place <br/>
and the Bronze Medal PLB for third to be awarded! As well as a few <br/>
other prizes that you can read all about on the race blog...<br/>
<br/>
On to the updates:<br/>
<br/>
Tan Dog was last known to be chewing sticks at the Coccinellidae <br/>
letterbox in Wofford Heights, CA...<br/>
<br/>
Green Hornet was last known to be buzzing in the Rancho San Antonio <br/>
Series: Quirky Quail letterbox in Cupertino, CA...<br/>
<br/>
Purple Turtle was last known to be hibernating at the Rock Camp <br/>
letterbox in Lake Arrowhead, CA...<br/>
<br/>
Black Bat was just dropped off today at the Leap Frog letterbox in <br/>
Mountville, PA...<br/>
<br/>
Blue Cat is in the arms of a letterboxer somewhere in Georgia and <br/>
should be dropped off soon...<br/>
<br/>
Grey Owl is in the arms of a letterboxer somewhere in Rhode Island <br/>
and should be dropped off soon...<br/>
<br/>
Orange Octopus and Yellow Kangaroo were picked up by letterboxers but <br/>
have not sent word in a long time - anyone have any info to share?<br/>
<br/>
Red Bull - poor Red Bull - is confirmed to be gone from his starting <br/>
box, but has never been heard from... Anyone else suspect foul play?<br/>
<br/>
And where in the world is Rosie Ruiz??? Haven't heard of her <br/>
whereabouts in quite some time...<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's all folks! To keep updated on the racers' progress and <br/>
