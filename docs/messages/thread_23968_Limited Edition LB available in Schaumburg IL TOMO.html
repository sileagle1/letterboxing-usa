<br/>
In conjuction with a local radio station's holiday food drive, Kiddy Writer and I have gotten <br/>
together to create a limited edition letterbox. This letterbox will only be available from me <br/>
during the radio station's broadcast time at a local Culver's restaurant. You can get this <br/>
letterbox by making a donation to the food drive and by saying a special phrase.<br/>
<br/>
I will be there from 3-7 PM tomorrow only [Wed] as that is when they are broadcasting <br/>
live.<br/>
<br/>
Kiddy Writer is providing the stamp, and the logbook was handmade by me in a Tim Holtz <br/>
class last spring. It has been on display in a local art show all summer and is quite special, <br/>
if I do say so myself. :-) [it's also made with alcohol inks which are activated by water, so <br/>
no way could I ever leave it outside anywhere]<br/>
<br/>
All further information can be found on AQ and Letterboxing.org. I am sure you can all <br/>
find the information yourselves. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping to meet lots of [well, a few] letterboxers and add to the holiday food drive <br/>
donations. So spread the word. And come by for frozen custard and a hello if you get a <br/>
chance and are in this area.<br/>
