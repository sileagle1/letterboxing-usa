I'd also like to point out that between Thanksgiving and New Years, <br/>
the garden here is decked out with over 200,000 christmas light--<br/>
similar to the Zoo Lights in Portland if you've ever seen them.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I arrived a couple of days before the light <br/>
extravaganza began, but I could see the hundreds of thousands of <br/>
unlit Christmas lights and it looks like it'll be a pretty incredible <br/>
show!  Definitely an ideal time to head out to this place, although <br/>
it might be a challenge finding this letterbox in the dark.  (Or <br/>
maybe not.  *shrug*  This is one of my easier clues and the hike <br/>
isn't at all a challenge.  Definitely doable, even at night!)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
