                    <div class="plaintext-content">CardinalMom, Pack Rat, Trail Buddy, and I had the opportunity to go <br/>
boxin' in NE Ohio a couple of days last week.  While temperatures <br/>
were quite nice, they had torrential rain early last week which <br/>
resulted in a LOT of mud and brutal clouds of ravenous insects.  The <br/>
boxers up there seem to be more into the hiking aspect of <br/>
letterboxing than we are but some weren't too long.  What we found <br/>
(and didn't!) follows:<br/>
<br/>
Mentor Headlands Beach - We paid for this one in blood!  The <br/>
mosquitos nearly ate us alive but the box is dry and in good shape.  <br/>
This is the most rugged box we have yet encountered!<br/>
<br/>
Squire's Castle - What a beautiful place!  The castle is really cool <br/>
and the setting is perfect.  The trails are nicely maintained too.  <br/>
Unfortunately, we didn't find the box.  The clues say the box was <br/>
moved because of trail maintanance and I think something got garbled <br/>
in the process.  We started out fine but then reached a point where <br/>
the clues just didn't make any sense.  We had to give up despite <br/>
checking what seemed like every tree in the park.<br/>
<br/>
Big Creek Park - These NE Ohioians must really love their parks!  The <br/>
area seems to be full of really nice county or regional parks.  This <br/>
is another example of them.  A nice little walk on well groomed <br/>
trails that takes you a nice tribute box dedicated to a local woman <br/>
that died on 9/11/01.  Probably the prettiest place we've ever had to <br/>
stamp in.  Clue could be a little clearer about which road to take <br/>
from the square.  Box is in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
Burton's Log Cabin - The placer must have been feeling a little <br/>
malicious when he planted this one!  Burton is a lovely historic town <br/>
laid out in the New England tradition and it has a great log cabin on <br/>
the town square.  (We also highly recommend the home-made ice cream <br/>
on the east side of the square!)  The town sits astride a ridge that <br/>
falls a loooooooong way from the square.  Be prepared for quite a <br/>
hike if you do this one!  Unfortunately, we did the hike and didn't <br/>
get the box.  Water, weeds, and voracious mosquitos  drove us out <br/>
before we found it.  The area was really overgrown as well and we <br/>
couldn't follow the clues.  Maybe another day with better <br/>
conditions!  The ice cream helped ease our disappointment!<br/>
<br/>
Punderson Park - This is in a very nice state park.  The clues are <br/>
good and a moderate hike brings you to an almost unbelievable hiding <br/>
spot.  It might help if you are part mountain goat or at least a <br/>
cliff rappeller!  This box has had a lot of traffic and needs to have <br/>
it's (large) zip-lock bags replaced.  It's in good shape for the <br/>
moment though - still dry.<br/>
<br/>
West Woods Park - Another lovely, immaculately maintained metro <br/>
park.  Another of those super rugged boxes and a very nice hand <br/>
carved stamp.  Box is in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
Peeper Hollow - Nice, short, easy walk in a most unusual spot.  Cool, <br/>
hand carved stamp and a cute little bonus!  Box had nearly washed <br/>
away in the recent rains.  We re-hid it a little higher and hopefully <br/>
drier.  Contents were damp and back had come off stamp.  Owner may <br/>
want to give it a little TLC sometime soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you NE Ohio boxers for adding some diversion to our annual <br/>
week at the beach!<br/>
