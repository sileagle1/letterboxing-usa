                    <div class="plaintext-content">Book altering involves taking an old (well, not necessarily old, but<br/>
otherwise unneeded, for lack of a better term) an altering it into a work of<br/>
art.  You can paint, stamp, collage, glue, cut, embellish, whatever suits<br/>
you.  Some people create their own altered books or participate in round<br/>
robin swaps where books are passed from person to person and each then<br/>
becomes a collection of others artwork.  A variation is a tip-in swap, where<br/>
people swap altered pages and then insert them into their book, without<br/>
actually working directly in the book or passing it around.<br/>
<br/>
www.abalteredbooks.com is a great resource to learn more.  Moderngypsy<br/>
(Eliza) is a letterboxer and a fabulous book alterer (better than I am!).<br/>
She provided me with a lot of my early letterboxing info before I joined<br/>
this group.  From our discussions on the ABAB list I think quite a few of<br/>
those members got interested in letterboxing.<br/>

What do you mean by altering books? The bookcrossing sounds fun to.<br/>
