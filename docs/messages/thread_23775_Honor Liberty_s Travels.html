excuse the following post. Also this post has been cross posted <br/>
purposely as many folks do not read the main chat list. <br/>
Honor Liberty Hitch Hiker was launched 9/11/2002 and it is a Hitch <br/>
Hiker with a different purpose and different method of notification. <br/>
The finder is supposed to post on a chat list the exact location <br/>
where it is left. For background see message # 34174 and message # <br/>
46814 on the main LbNA chatlist. Those messages were listings of <br/>
comments from the letterboxers that found her. It makes pretty good <br/>
reading on this date.<br/>
<br/>
We were sent the text from the logbook from the last finders, The <br/>
Foxes in Montana, and it too makes good reading. <br/>

this post.  We just received Honor Liberty from Singing Wolf and we <br/>
are posting this on 9-11. Normally a Hitch Hiker report is found on <br/>
the HH chat list, but with other different aspects of this HH, the <br/>
report is being filed on this list. A short explanation for those <br/>
newer letterboxers is probably in order, so here goes; After <br/>
9/11/2001, I wanted never to see the Towers coming down as was shown <br/>
over and over on TV. As more time passed I changed my mind and <br/>
believe that we should probably have that scene replayed several <br/>
times each year to make sure we never forget the horror. With that <br/>
sentiment Honor Liberty HH was launched on 9/11/2002 with specific <br/>
instructions to post on the chat list it's current location, and <br/>
write in the logbook any sentiments the finder wished. In some cases <br/>
the race was on when ever the location was posted, and in other cases <br/>
the new finder was reluctant to post the new location due to the <br/>
procedure being contrary to normal procedures for Hitch Hikers. The <br/>
first year's travels can be found on the main LbNA yahoo chatlist in <br/>
message # 34174, dated October 03, 2003, the subsequent years travels <br/>
can be found in message # 46814 and #57329. The following is a list <br/>
of those locations and letterboxers that commented during her travels <br/>
this past year. (Please excuse any omissions or errors).<br/>
Some folks have had more than one visit with her, and I think Silent <br/>
Doug has the record for most visits at 3.<br/>
