Yelling is a no no - <br/>
Via electronic communications - yelling is signified by all caps. <br/>
<br/>
As in: "PUT THE LID BACK ON MY BOX!"<br/>
<br/>
I understand that, in the moment, strong feelings may cause strong <br/>
actions. There may be no way to pinpoint the guilty party and <br/>
approach them directly, so yelling at everyone is often a natural <br/>
first response.  Followed by threats. <br/>
<br/>
A gentle reminder could be more appropriate, followed by the natural <br/>
course of unfortunate consequences.  <br/>
<br/>
"Please remember to seal the letterbox tightly. I found a few of mine <br/>
nearly ruined by moisture.  I fear I may have to remove all these <br/>
boxes if this continues."<br/>
<br/>
But action often preceeds thought when moved by passion.  Inversely, <br/>
perhaps the nice way didn't work and now it's no-more-mister-nice-<br/>
boxer.<br/>
<br/>
Another - who, perhaps feeling unjustly yelled at and threatened - or <br/>
even simply flippant, may respond also in a natural first <br/>
instinct. "I don't know you, I'm not even near you, never touched <br/>
your boxes and your yelling at me? I don't care for you or your <br/>
boxes." <br/>
<br/>
Yet another - also feeling strongly and taking up the cause of the <br/>
yelling one, takes a moment out of their day to make blanket <br/>
statements and point fingers.<br/>
<br/>
"You're the reason boxing is going to hell. It's people like you that <br/>
give boxing a bad name and ruin it for everyone."<br/>
<br/>
Where are the manners?<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the trailer for a recent movie - Screaming angrily, <br/>
one girl chucks a Bible at the head of a retreating figure of <br/>
another, "I am FILLED with the love of Christ!"<br/>
<br/>
If one really wants to prevent the ruination of letterboxing (and the <br/>
decline of western civilization)...all they need do is put the <br/>
letterbox back where they found it with care.<br/>

guiding you from a flame war. For which I'm thankful (tip of my hat to you<br/>
Ivy) You are obviously looking to start one, with your quick and angry<br/>
responses. Now, to the meat of the problem. I've placed many boxes, I don't<br/>
keep a p-f-x count, so I can't give an exact number without consulting my<br/>
log, which is still in the car from our trip today. They go missing quite<br/>
frequently, one went missing before ever getting stamped in! the first time<br/>
one went missing (it was my first) it did hurt my feelings, but upon<br/>
consideration, I realized I left something that can't defend itself out in<br/>
the woods, at the mercy of weather, people, and animals. They will go<br/>
missing if the area is frequented by any of these things. I have come to see<br/>
it as a life span, some live longer than others. I don't replace. I just<br/>
remember fondly, and move on. I figure it's inevitable, sad, but not so<br/>
devastating that I feel the need to grab up every letterbox I meet and bring<br/>
it home to keep it safe! That ruins the fun for others, and you can't share<br/>
your artwork very effectively if it's caught up in a lock box where it will<br/>
be safe. I love letterboxing. I love the outdoors-ness of it. The adventure<br/>
of it. The art of it. The secret of it, but really, it's just a bit of<br/>
eraser and some paper, not a life. The life comes from the visitors to the<br/>
box. Flame away, I can take it! After all, this isn't my "real" life, just a<br/>
online facsimile! :o)<br/>

I fear I am guilty of "blanket statements" but hey, it gets cold up <br/>
here in the north country ;-)  My brain freezes.<br/>

&gt; Hypothetical conversations : Loosely based on actually happenings.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yelling is a no no - <br/>
&gt; Via electronic communications - yelling is signified by all caps. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As in: "PUT THE LID BACK ON MY BOX!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand that, in the moment, strong feelings may cause strong <br/>
&gt; actions. There may be no way to pinpoint the guilty party and <br/>
&gt; approach them directly, so yelling at everyone is often a natural <br/>
&gt; first response.  Followed by threats. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A gentle reminder could be more appropriate, followed by the <br/>
natural <br/>
&gt; course of unfortunate consequences.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "Please remember to seal the letterbox tightly. I found a few of <br/>
mine <br/>
&gt; nearly ruined by moisture.  I fear I may have to remove all these <br/>
&gt; boxes if this continues."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But action often preceeds thought when moved by passion.  <br/>
Inversely, <br/>
&gt; perhaps the nice way didn't work and now it's no-more-mister-nice-<br/>
&gt; boxer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another - who, perhaps feeling unjustly yelled at and threatened - <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; even simply flippant, may respond also in a natural first <br/>
&gt; instinct. "I don't know you, I'm not even near you, never touched <br/>
&gt; your boxes and your yelling at me? I don't care for you or your <br/>
&gt; boxes." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yet another - also feeling strongly and taking up the cause of the <br/>
&gt; yelling one, takes a moment out of their day to make blanket <br/>
&gt; statements and point fingers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "You're the reason boxing is going to hell. It's people like you <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; give boxing a bad name and ruin it for everyone."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Where are the manners?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It reminds me of the trailer for a recent movie - Screaming <br/>
angrily, <br/>
&gt; one girl chucks a Bible at the head of a retreating figure of <br/>
&gt; another, "I am FILLED with the love of Christ!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If one really wants to prevent the ruination of letterboxing (and <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; decline of western civilization)...all they need do is put the <br/>
&gt; letterbox back where they found it with care.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not really sure why I'm composing this post.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll stop now.<br/>
