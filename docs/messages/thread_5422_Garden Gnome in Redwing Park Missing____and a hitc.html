<br/>
<br/>What a treat to find the second box "Redwing" in its special hiding place...and coupled with a hitchhiker...Golden Dragon.  Woo hoo!
<br/>
<br/>Drakes and dog Buddy....Your clues were wonderful!  What fun.  We will take the hitchhiker to a wonderful new home...give us a few days to think about where....

<br/>
Yes the Garden Gnome is, indeed, missing.  He came up<br/>
missing at his old hiding place- he washed out of it<br/>
and down the creek heading to sea, but I tracked him<br/>
down- hence the new hiding spot.  I can't, for the<br/>
life of me, figure out where he's gone to now- his new<br/>
hiding spot was not conspicuous at all- so I can only<br/>
assume he was taken by park personnel at some point, I<br/>
just don't know how they 'came upon' him.<br/>
<br/>
  I'm sad to see the little guy gone but very happy<br/>
that you've picked up the hitchhiker.  Unfortunately,<br/>
the email addy with the hitchhiker doesn't work so I'm<br/>
hoping whomever placed it is part of the list so they<br/>
can track it's travels as they asked.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to find your new boxes- I'm so excited! :o)<br/>
