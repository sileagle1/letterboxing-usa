I'm a letterboxing newbie who just discovered it about 2 weeks ago.  <br/>
<br/>
We were lucky enough to be out of town close to the "Love The Hills" <br/>
letterbox about a week ago - and we found it!!  It was a great, short <br/>
hike in a very nice park.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, there aren't many boxes close by so we'll have to <br/>
travel to find a lot of them.  We are currently scoping some areas <br/>
here in Pensacola, FL, though, so maybe it will catch on here soon.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and one more thing...I'm hooked!!<br/>
