on or travels. Ithaca is not that far from us , relatively speaking , a<br/>
few hours or so and is within our reach. It's  for sure if we would be up<br/>
in that direction <br/>
<br/>
Well we (J&amp;G&amp;"bud") were out this past weekend checking out two great<br/>
places we had never been to before.  We  arrived at the light house<br/>
(Highland Light) early in the morning to stamp in and what a good hiding<br/>
spot. The lb was safe and sound. Great Stamp! We had forgotten of all<br/>
things our own ink pad so we used the one inside (red) - worked fine! <br/>
Luckily it was early so we beat the rush of people enjoying the sights<br/>
that day and was able to hide it back without notice.. On our travels<br/>
back off  the cape heading home we found the start of the rail trail and<br/>
proceeded to the Tandem Mates  Letterbox. Wow!  What a great way to hide<br/>
a box. Little tricky , we poked around the area and found it. Box is also<br/>
in great shape. Nobody from the cemetery bothered us....Ha! , so we took<br/>
our time on this one.<br/>
        One neat thing that I did accomplish was to attach some 2" high<br/>
"self stick" letters to the back of our 1986 Caravan spelling<br/>
"LETTERBOXING.ORG"  . The "gold on black" letters come from  "Hy-Ko<br/>
Products  Company" and there is just enough letters in one pack (54<br/>
total) to get  spell it out with not an extra to spare ,  it was "meant<br/>
to be".<br/>
        So if you see a Maroon Caravan on the road , filled with bumper<br/>
stickers and the "letterboxing logo" spelt out on the back, with a blind<br/>
cocker spaniel  in the middle front center seat,  that's us! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!  - Budsterrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br/>
