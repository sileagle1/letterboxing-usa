<br/>
I was reading the end of "Song of Myself" over the weekend and got to <br/>
wondering, was Walt actually the first American letterboxer?  What do <br/>
you think?<br/>
<br/>
I bequeathe myself to the dirt, to grow from the grass I love;<br/>
   If you want me again, look for me under your boot-soles.<br/>
<br/>
   You will hardly know who I am, or what I mean;<br/>
   But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,<br/>
   And filter and fibre your blood.                                 <br/>
<br/>
   Failing to fetch me at first, keep encouraged;<br/>
   Missing me one place, search another;<br/>
   I stop somewhere, waiting for you.<br/>

in beautiful Leverett, Mass.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Erik, I have been trying unsuccessfully to find the lyrics to <br/>
Todd Rundgren's "Song of the Viking" for you.  From his <br/>
Something/Anything LP of the mid-70s.  Know it?  The last line is <br/>
"Erik is here" as I recall.  It's a wonderful song.<br/>
