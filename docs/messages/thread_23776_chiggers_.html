then, and actually pose more of a health risk than chiggers.  Either one can<br/>
be controlled by using Off or Repel or any bug repellent.<br/>

I agree with Lucy, though. Mosquitoes are likely to be a bigger <br/>

As folks have already said, do use insect repellent, especially around<br/>
the 'bands' of your clothes:  waistbands, cuffs, the tops of your<br/>
socks, where chiggers like to hide.  If you do get them there is an<br/>
old home remedy that says to put nail polish on the bites to smother<br/>
the chiggers, but I've researched it and by the time you're itching<br/>
the damage is done.  So don't bother with nail polish.  Chiggers don't<br/>
seem to be dangerous, but they itch like a son of a gun, so do wear<br/>
that insect repellant!<br/>

Hmm I go to Mexico All the time but there are NO chiggers and there <br/>
are none here in CA I think it is too dry and I travel along the <br/>
coast.   Ticks yes but mostly in the Spring. and we have Mosqies all <br/>
year long. Sorry if you travel to the coast and you will be OK! except <br/>
for all the tropical critters like gators be careful and swim where <br/>
the locals do it is for a reason!<br/>

I'm a native Texan, and I can say with confidence that you won't <br/>
need any precautions except regular old bug spray (and sunscreen, <br/>
but that's another topic).  Chiggers won't be a problem in October, <br/>
but mosquitos might be depending on where you are (actually, I find <br/>
the mosquitos to be more of a problem in Ohio than in Texas).  Don't <br/>
worry about spraying around your underwear and bra -- just exposed <br/>
skin and around your socks.  Above all, just have fun boxing in <br/>
God's Country.<br/>
Take care,<br/>
