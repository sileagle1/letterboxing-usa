just take them for how they are meant... Sincere thanks for kind thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
While I haven't received any "while you are recouperating" sympathy boxes<br/>
during my recovery from surgery (not that I wanted any) I do want to thank<br/>
Sleepy Whippet and Wingnut for their wonderful thoughts sent in "Get well<br/>
soon" snail-mail cards not to mention the well-wishes of many on this<br/>
list... It will still be a while before I am able to hit the trails again,<br/>
but it's good to see that so many care enough to send their well-wishes!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
