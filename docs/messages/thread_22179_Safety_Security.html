comes to the Second Amendment, but I don't believe this is the proper <br/>
forum to criticize or discuss a person's civil rights.<br/>
<br/>
 If you would like to read an article concerning "Safety/Security" I <br/>
have posted at several web sites then I encourage you to do so. See AQ <br/>
under Code of Conduct, or Letterboxing 101 at Mark and Sue's site, or <br/>
under aticles at Silent Doug's site, and there is a link posted at the <br/>
newboxers site as well.<br/>

FYI, Pepper spray has a very short shelf life as does Bear Spray.<br/>
Regular Pepper spray can be seasoning for bears and vicious dogs i.e <br/>
PitBulls, and may not stop a cougar.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line in this discussion should be your safety and your <br/>
security and not everyone will arrive at the same conclusion on how to <br/>
remain safe, it should not be a discussion on how to repeal our civil <br/>
rights. Some folks don't like guns and some folks appreciate their <br/>
value, and neither side will change their opinion.<br/>
