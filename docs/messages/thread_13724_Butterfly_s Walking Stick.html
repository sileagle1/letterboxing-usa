                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you Butterfly and Music Women for the kind words.  From what <br/>
I've seen with the kind folks of Letterboxing, I'm sure most would be <br/>
happy to help out another Letterboxer in need.  The Walking Stick <br/>
H.H. was beautiful.  And lastly it was all Lenny's idea with <br/>
the "other stick" LOL... only kidding... I wish I could of held a <br/>
straight face longer.  Your expression Butterfly was priceless.  I am <br/>
glad we were able to bless you with your stick.  You can tell it <br/>
meant alot to you. And that is something I'll never forget. God Bless <br/>
