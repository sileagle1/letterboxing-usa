                    <div class="plaintext-content">Boxes in the area that I know are there (not missing) are the ones at <br/>
Byxbee Park in Palo Alto, and at least one of the boxes at Bay <br/>
Wildlife Refuge in Fremont.  Also, Ryan Carpenter found the Loma <br/>
Prieta earthquake box in Aptos last month.  The Presido boxes are <br/>
missing and so are the ones at Bol Park in Palo Alto.<br/>
<br/>
For a complete list of boxes, go to www.letterboxing.org, click on <br/>
the big red book, this is where the clues are listed by State.  Click <br/>
on your State, then your area, etc etc  You can also keep up with <br/>
what is new, by clicking on the What's New section!  This way, you <br/>
don't have to wade through tons of these messages to find boxes in <br/>
your area!  <br/>

park boxes!--and maybe the new fishy's hybrid box too!!)<br/>
