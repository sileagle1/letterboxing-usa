boxes in MD (nice stamps and we were first finders, yea!). Very <br/>
nostalgic for me. I grew up nearby and went there often as a child. <br/>
This is a VERY busy park in nice weather. From there we went over the <br/>
DC line to Squirrel's 2 Rock Creek Park boxes at the nature center. <br/>
They are still there after almost 3 years! The logbooks are full and <br/>
we didn't have spares, so we added some pages. (If anyone is planning <br/>
to find these, maybe you could bring a couple extra logbooks.) We <br/>
drove back to MD with just enough daylight to visit the 2 Climber <br/>
boxes in Bethesda. Both are in good shape but very inky! (D and Shoo: <br/>
we'll be back to find your other 2 boxes another day.)<br/>
