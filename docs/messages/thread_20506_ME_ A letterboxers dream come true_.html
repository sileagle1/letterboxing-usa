                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey folks<br/>
I haven't posted on this list for a long time - been very busy getting back to normal <br/>
life (ha!) after this summer's wedding. Consequently, I haven't been up to snuff on <br/>
placing boxes either! For that I will make up fully this fall. This is now prime <br/>
letterboxing season in Maine - only the leaf peepers remain for touristas and the <br/>
trails are much less congested.<br/>
<br/>
I had the fortune to find Merenwen and Olwe's "The Art Guru" letterbox this weekend. <br/>
This is not to be missed. I truly enjoyed their stamp....I highly suggest a visit to this <br/>
spot. And just in case you needed a little more convincing, I just placed a new box in <br/>
Gorham called DIZZY! <br/>
<br/>
While I was visiting with those fine folks, Olwe showed me something that speaks <br/>
volumes to you trail troopers out there. THE PERFECT - and I mean, perfect solution <br/>
to a backpack/letterboxing pack/folding chair/assembly. This is a portable pack that <br/>
has a built in folding seat and it collapses with shoulder straps so that you can wear it <br/>
like a backpack. I'm not kidding you - this is a letterboxers dream come true!!  Ask <br/>
him to demo one of these puppies next time you visit!<br/>
<br/>
And finally, though my visit was confined mostly to the greater Portland area, I also <br/>
placed a new box in honor of the fantastic city skyline view from Back Cove. This <br/>
original idea came from the logo used by a local coffeehouse that I am partial to. I <br/>
hope you all have a chance to visit this gem of a city I know and love as Portland, <br/>
Maine.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
