enjoyed your Bartlett Brook so much we wanted to give you  one back. <br/>
To everyone else enjoy this night adventure it took me awhile to get <br/>
the clues done, to much going on here. I love the night idea, it took <br/>
me awhile to think of a place that wasn't closed at sunset and was <br/>
safe for a family to go boxing in the dark and not get lost.  The <br/>
history lesson, well isn't it nice when learning is fun!  Hope you <br/>
enjoy. Carol  <br/>
