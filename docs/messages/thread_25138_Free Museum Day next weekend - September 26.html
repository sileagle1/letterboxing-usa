There are museums that participate all over the country, not just Smithsonian Museums.  For instance, here in Memphis, there are 3 museums that I plan to visit that day all for free, the Belz Museum downtown, the Rock and Soul Museum and the Metal Museum.  To visit more than 1 museum, you just print out more than one free general admission passes at the link below.  Each pass admits 2 people, so if you are a family of 4, be sure to print out 2 passes for each museum you want to visit.  I would love to hear responses from people who were able to take advantage of this free museum day.<br/>
