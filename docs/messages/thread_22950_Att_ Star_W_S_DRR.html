You might have missed my post about deleting messages off of the list, <br/>
but here it is again.<br/>
Any one that posts a message can delete that message(only their own) <br/>
from the list. If you go to the message list click on that message, <br/>
then up in the right hand corner you will find 3 buttons; <br/>
Reply,Forward, and Delete. Just hit delete and then hit ok when <br/>
prompted. Several of my posts end up coming in duplicated so I use <br/>
this function occasionally.<br/>
The other alternative is to request that your message and a subsequent <br/>
message that contained the same info be deleted by a moderator. <br/>
Unfortunately somebody left the info in when they posted a request for <br/>
more info about PLBs and that one you do not have any control over. <br/>
Sometimes it is just too easy to hit reply and leave the previous post <br/>
attached to your reply.<br/>

I'm fairly sure that everyone that posts a message can delete their <br/>
own message. I just deleted my message # 54084 from the list. First go <br/>
to "messages" on the left hand side of the home page, scroll to your <br/>
message and click on that message. I believe that when you are at that <br/>
message then the delete button will be right next to the reply and <br/>
forward buttons.<br/>
