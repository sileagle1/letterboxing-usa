  Hi, we are the treehuggers_lbna Our kids kind of voted on the name... and well today we had our first time and first find. We recorded everything at atlasquest... and we made a family page to log stuff. Anyhow, won't give all details but, if you want to know (I did not give any clues away) our new page is at http://www.myspace.com/treehuggers_lbna I am thinking that not only will we have our journal books, but, we will have the log for other boxers to look at. I put on there how we came about our name, who got us started, and last...our first attempt and adventure which was today/yesterday (I am up late) We had a blast... kids loved it. My son cleaned up the area from litter too. LOL I didn't ask him to...he just did. I took pictures, my daughter picked up special rocks, and my other daughter walked my golden retriever and allowed him to meet friends and sniff a couple dog butts...it was great for her being at the park because there were painters and she is a painter... last my husband LOVED IT TOO. He packed the lunch and many other things lol. Great family day.<br/>
<br/>
  I'm happy to say our first attempt we found the box. It did help that we kind of already knew the park and it has a very special meaning for us anyhow. The funny part was we picked this because going to a park is free...but it just so happens that today was a motor boat race soooo... they had a 5.00 fee...thankfully if we walked to the park it was no charge. <br/>
<br/>
  This was the Elizabeth Bridge box and in Trenton Michigan (yes the letterboxer gives this info away anyhow.)<br/>
<br/>
  Our next thing is to try and make a stamp.<br/>
