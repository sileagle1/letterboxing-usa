&gt; And no -- logging the box is not necessarily a part of it -- it can be, but for some people <br/>
it isn't and that is their choice to make.  Although I don't feel there is any obligation <br/>
whatsoever on the part of a finder to contact the placer or record a status when they find a <br/>
box, I do agree that it is courtesy to thank the placer when you find their box.  I very much <br/>
appreciate this and I think most people are in that camp, but logging the find is only one way <br/>
to do that.  Personally I liked it much better before LbNA had the ability for people to log <br/>
their finds because I received many, many personal e-mails from people telling me of their <br/>
adventure.  I loved reading their comments about the way they interpretted the clues, the <br/>
condition of the box or how they enjoyed the location, etc.  This is the kind of feedback I <br/>
prefer, so this is the type of feedback I choose to give.<br/>
