canaveral marsh letterbox yet. Hopefully I will get it in place next <br/>
week. A couple of people have searched for it since I posted that it <br/>
had been pulled for repairs. I _will_ post a note when it is back in <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
There are apparently several of us now in Florida. I would suggest <br/>
that perhaps we begin to think about trying to organize a get <br/>
together at some point in the next few months. If you live in Florida <br/>
and are interested in trying to get together sometime, please contact <br/>
me directly (off list) and I will work on trying to arrange this. I <br/>
will not be available to reply to any message until next week.Thanks.<br/>
