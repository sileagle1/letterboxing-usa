A BY WATER  letterbox Canoe, Kayak or fishing  boat required.<br/>
<br/>
Depends on your Mode of travel; could be a few minutes to two hours<br/>
<br/>
Planted 5-19-01 by Cowboy and Leader of the Pack<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We ventured to Mansfield Hollow in Mansfield by way of Bassetts <br/>
Bridge Rd.  We were taking brand new Kayaks for a first adventure in <br/>
the lake. The day was grand, our paddles , lifejackets and kayaks in <br/>
the back of the pickup. Old Town Canoe was having a great <br/>
demonstration  sponsored by our friends at Water Works Canoe Rte 6 N. <br/>
Windham. You can rent a canoe or kayak here.  Many of  their models <br/>
were available for trying what a fun day!  We suggest you go to the <br/>
boat launch and put in there.  Paddle through the tubes and head <br/>
toward the dam. As you come down the lake come around the  meadow <br/>
keep the meadow on the right as you come into view of the dam keep it <br/>
to your right and head directly toward the dike in the distance.  The <br/>
dike here resembles the great wall of China. Keep your eyes  alert we <br/>
saw a muskrat , and a great blue heron on this trip.  We needed to <br/>
turn along the opposite shore as  we passed three trees on the waters <br/>
edge, a gravel embankment to the water and into a small cove on the <br/>
left. This is such a quiet little cove we paddled straight to the <br/>
end  our back was to the dike now  and beached our boats there. We <br/>
scrambled up the embankment under the pines at the peak of the little <br/>
hill we took a right. Note two large pines that have fallen. In the <br/>
roots of the further one the Lone Goose has made her nest. Good Luck <br/>
and remember where a life jacket everyone! <br/>

    We can't wait to get up to Mansfield to find your new box.  We have been<br/>
thinking about making a canoe/kayak letterbox for a while now.  We even have<br/>
the stamp carved and ready to go.  Looking forward to a paddle on the lake!!<br/>
    Thanks,<br/>
