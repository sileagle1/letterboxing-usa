We were there this winter and these two were not in good shape, though <br/>
you can still take an impression of the stamps, the books were wet. We <br/>
know that the Drews are unable to frequently check on a lot of their <br/>
earlier boxes, because of distance &amp; time restraints. We help with <br/>
maintenance when we can, but that day we didn't have any spare <br/>
journals with us.<br/>
<br/>
Wild Hearts was in fine condition.<br/>

Those would be the Drew Clan's Gay City boxes.  Yeah, I noticed they do not <br/>
have any other Bolton boxes listed on the LBNA site.  Try <br/>
letterboxingcentral.com; the Drew Clan have their boxes listed over there.<br/>

To LB:  the clues to the Gay City box were online until quite recently.  <br/>
There's no reason to get snippy at the rest of us.  The boxes were still out there <br/>

Actually it is! She asked if anyone knew the statis of the others boxes<br/>
since she could not find the clues. I was just sharing that they MAY not be<br/>
there for a few reasons. Many of us carry folders with clues for boxes in<br/>
the area and if someone needs clues to a box (on the trail or if the link is<br/>
down) &amp; I have already found it I can give them the copy. I know others do<br/>
this as well. Just an act of kindness! If someone not knowing they may have<br/>
been removed gave her a copy and she spent  tons of time trying to find her<br/>
starting spot (the only clue to where to start for the WH box is "after<br/>
stamping into box 1 continue...")<br/>
 I really don't see why this little helpful suggestion offended you so much<br/>
that you felt you needed to be rude with your little "GET IT?"<br/>
People, this is a fun hobby and this list is for helping others do we have<br/>
to rude to one another especially when I was just trying to help! When I<br/>
started doing this many, many boxes ago it was fun to meet other boxers at<br/>
gatherings and on the trail, kind of like we had our own little secret<br/>
society for lack of a better term, but I gotta tell you over the last few<br/>
months with some of the things be written back forth I wonder if it is just<br/>
better to keep to each ourselves and to hell with Xs and helping others!<br/>
Can't we all just get along and be friends since we all share a love of<br/>
boxing!<br/>
