What happened to appreciating works for what they are-<br/>
Things that inspire the mind to work and create and imagine.<br/>
Chris, you obviously were just waiting for something to fire up your <br/>
topic. I never said any of the things you resumed I was thinking. I <br/>
know the book is fiction, but as an art history student, I found the <br/>
use of facts such as Leonardo DaVinci's use of codes and secret <br/>
composition, the idea of Divine Proportion (what a great math lesson <br/>
for kids) and the idea of art intertwined with the secret world of <br/>
religion all very captivating topics to weave a compelling story <br/>
around.  As LOTR is grandeously woven around mythology and <br/>
folklore.  Everyone missed the point. Movies and books, whether they <br/>
be wrapped around something mysterious and quietly hidden in the <br/>
real world, or completely fabricated from a mind- they can all be an <br/>
amazing source of inspiration for ones own creations.<br/>
Loosen up people. In a world like this, we need to relish <br/>
imagination and creativity. <br/>
Also, both books offer a lot of different thing to pull on for <br/>
stamps. This WAS originally about letterboxing, which should NEVER <br/>
be so serious, by the way. Codes and riddles are an awesome way to <br/>
start off with a new letterbox.<br/>
