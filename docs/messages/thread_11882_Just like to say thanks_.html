                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks everyone for the kind words about our State series,the carvings will be getting better because we found a trick to it,called the pink stuff.We bought some at the Lily Pad and tried it for the first time WOW what a difference.Chuck we love your personal traveler and your wooden nickles please save one for us tomorrow it was a great idea.We had a personal traveler but we kept forgetting to take it out when we ran into people on the trail,so we turned it into a Hitch Hiker instead.Our biggest problem is we have a lot of ideas for letterboxes, we have 20 more ready to be planted not counting the State series but Windham County,at least our end of it has no trails.So we're not trying to step on anyones toes by planting some of our boxes on trails that already have boxes on them,we just want to do our part and give others a chance to stamp more letterboxes.We try to find new trails or we put them on some of our favorite trails with beautiful scenery.We hope you all enjoy our new letterboxes,and we hope to see you all on sunday at 1:00 p.m at Dianas Pool in Chaplin for the Molly meet.Lenny/Kathy The NeeDeeps.    <br/>
