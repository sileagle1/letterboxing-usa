<br/>
Just thought that I'd pass along something totally cool.  A couple of <br/>
weeks ago, my son and I planted the Rodale Fitness Park Letterbox and <br/>
the Fat Dawg Hitchhiker.  We got an email a few days later asking <br/>
for 'non-letterboxy' (non-compass-dependent) directions because the <br/>
person did not have a compass.  He and his girlfriend were going <br/>
letterboxing in the afternoon of a particular day and he wanted to <br/>
sneak a surprise marriage proposal into the letterbox that morning.  <br/>
His girlfriend is the compass-bearer.<br/>
<br/>
So, I had no problem in providing private alternate clues to such a <br/>
noble cause!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, the secret proposal stashed in the letterbox was a <br/>
success and our friend now has a fiance!<br/>
<br/>
Other good news is that the Fat Dawg is finally getting some exercise <br/>
and heading to the Philly area to mooch some cheesesteaks!<br/>
<br/>
I guess you can call it the 'feel good story of the week'.<br/>
<br/>
Now back to your regularly scheduled flame war!  ;-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's quite a great story!  I was so glad to hear you'd planted a box at<br/>
Rodale Fitness park, as it is a terrific place if you're into biking,<br/>
roller-blading, or walking.  I haven't been able to look for the boxes yet,<br/>
but definitely will this summer when kids are home-- they love exercising<br/>
there.  Back when my daughter did track bike racing at the Velodrome, we got<br/>
there often.  For any of you who are in the area and haven't been there, the<br/>
wide lanes for roller-blading and biking that sweep through the park are<br/>
unparalleled in this area.  Clean &amp; smooth, partly wooded, partly open, &amp; a<br/>
choice between hilly and non-hilly.  One could make a great Fri. eve. with a<br/>
search for the letterbox, then a picnic, then walk across the street to the<br/>
Lehigh Valley Velodrome and take in an evening of bicycle racing.  These are<br/>
world-class races and great names show up there.  Oh-- and if you hit the<br/>
fitness lanes at the right time of year (mid-June?) look for huge<br/>
wineberries by the thousands edging the wooded area.  (like a raspberry but<br/>
redder and juicier) Take a cup and eat them on the spot-- they don't keep<br/>
well.   --lunaryakketyact<br/>

That sometimes is the case if the wineberries are allowed to ferment <br/>
