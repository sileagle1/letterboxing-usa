                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  Started letterboxing in August and have been placing and finding <br/>
a lot of boxes in southeastern Mass.  Just thought we would let you <br/>
know that the following boxes are alive and well as of 11/22/03:<br/>
<br/>
Newt Rockne in Rehoboth<br/>
Flight of the Bumble Bee's Revenge and Hunny Letterbox in Attleboro.<br/>
<br/>
Tried to find Soaring Willows in Seekonk, but we couldnt find the <br/>
hemlock trail and there are no trail maps anywhere.  It looks like <br/>
they have been doing a lot of work, and there is a sign that says the <br/>
trail names are changing (the trails we saw had names of colors:  Red <br/>
Trail, Yellow Trail, etc.)  Is this something new?  Do the clues need <br/>
to be changed?<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has been to any of our letterboxes (jay and amy) recently, <br/>
please let us know how they are doing!<br/>
<br/>
Also, curious about the two HH we have sent out:  The J and A HH and <br/>
Harriet's Hitchhiker (little fishy stamp).  If you have seen them, <br/>
please let us know!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

All I can say about that Soaring Willows box is that Betz and I tried to find it more than 2 years ago.  We, too, had no trail map from the little building at parking lot.  We talked to people on the trails and it wasn't much help; they had no idea where the "hemlock trail" was, and they walked the area frequently. We gave up after quite a walk.  IIRC, we tried to fit the clues to where we walked and what we saw, but that didn't work.  <shrug>  So our experience wasn't much different than yours and we tried a very long time ago.  There might be maps on-line at the Audubon site.  ASRI controls the Seekonk refuge, AFAIK.<br/>

Actually we found the box in the snow last Thanksgiving morning . It <br/>
was a beautiful , crisp , clear day with about six inches of fresh <br/>
snow . This is a box we still talk of finding . One of our favorites .<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks.  We found Soaring Willows last spring (April 3 I believe). <br/>
There is a map to the refuge on the LBNA website under files/MA trail<br/>
maps.  The day that we went there were better trail maps available in<br/>
the little house on the site.  Yes some of the trails are being<br/>
relabeled, but the box is a little tricky --- just keep looking!<br/>
<br/>
We picked up Harriet's HH at "The Forgotten Road" on Cape Cod and<br/>
placed it somewhere else.  Sorry, I've been a little behind with my HH<br/>
reports.<br/>
