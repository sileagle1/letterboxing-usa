Mansfield  300 th  Anniversary Series<br/>
<br/>
    Taking Rte 44 into Mansfield you bump over the tracks and turn in <br/>
at the Depot restraunt.  Drive out  back along the gravel road and <br/>
park out of the way.  There are other boxes in the Depot  you could <br/>
get to, White grape and Rub a Dub Dub are on this trail.  Gather your <br/>
supplies watch your kids and dog ,the tracks here are still used. We <br/>
saw a train when we went here, heard the rumble of the engine  and <br/>
the earth shake with its power. Look to pick up the white trail and <br/>
follow it down the hill.<br/>
   Long ago in Mansfield the Depot was the heart beat  the booming <br/>
University and the State training school had regular deliveries. One <br/>
item that came by train was coal to heat the buildings. Imagine lines <br/>
of horses and wagons and later trucks  lining up here for their turn <br/>
to haul the precious fuel away. It was a several mile trip and the <br/>
roads  were rough in spring , fall and winter. Down the hill the <br/>
teamsters came backing their rig under the great trestle.<br/>
    The trestle is no longer in use. But watch as you climb the hill <br/>
for the gravel road is gray with years of coal dust.When you get to <br/>
the trestle count your way to the ninth bay. Follow the right wall <br/>
around the bump out and toward the back. Under some black tar your  <br/>
treasure is hidden.  Stamp privately and rehide the same so others <br/>
may enjoy. As always have fun and be safe. <br/>
