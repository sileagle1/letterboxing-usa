movie set and a group of Senior Citizens all over the place painting <br/>
pictures. We were unable to see the Queen Anne cottage because the <br/>
movie crew was all over the grounds.<br/>
<br/>
California Bear didn't get if you found the HOT box or not, but it is <br/>
missing. At least it wasn't in the HOT place we looked.<br/>
<br/>
The other box is in a wonderful spot. So all you So.Cal. people go <br/>
for it. <br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to find places here to hide boxes because of all the <br/>
gardeners and manicured lawns. Oh for some big trees, ferns and wide <br/>
open spaces!!! Purple Iris<br/>

who've been unable to find the Succulent Box LB at the Los Angeles <br/>
County Arboretum, but I'd like to confirm that it did exist, and I <br/>
was the first stamp on March 17, 2003.  I haven't been back to the <br/>
arboretum (even though it's 10 minutes from my house--it's that $5 <br/>
entrance fee that stops me) but will visit in the near future to <br/>
confirm that this box is absolutely, positively missing.<br/>
