Redmond).  A couple of my other (Seattle area) friends, just got turned on <br/>
to Letterboxing too.  So with luck I wont be the only one placing new boxes.<br/>
<br/>
My friends and I hope to hit the Rattlesnake Lake box in a few weeks as our <br/>
first box (Oy! I lived with in walking distance from there in Highshool!  <br/>
Small World <g>)<br/>
<br/>
I hope to place my first box on 4th of July when I go over to.... Heh.... <br/>
you'll see, but it's local.  =)  This one wont be too ambitious though (hike <br/>
or find wise)... but hey, it's my first.  =D<br/>
<br/>
Talk at you later!<br/>

&gt;I just learned of Letterboxing yesterday, and Im very extited to<br/>
get<br/>

&gt;my first letterbox stamp (I have 3 letterboxes in mind to place in<br/>
the near<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a question though, when equiping a letterbox do you include<br/>
an ink pad<br/>
&gt;or not?  Most guides dont mention including an ink pad, but I<br/>
wanted to be<br/>
&gt;sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I cant wait to get started.  My husband is supportive of the<br/>
idea....<br/>

Hurrah!  I hope you are in the Seattle area.  Since most of the<br/>
Pacific Northwest boxes are concentrated in Oregon, it will be nice<br/>
to have more up this way!<br/>
<br/>
I should get up off my butt and plant a few, (I have been working on<br/>
carving some stamps...but my art needs refining.)<br/>

<br/>
I'm so glad people up in Northwestern Washington are getting into<br/>
letterboxing.  Rattlesnake Ledge has a spectacular view.  We went up<br/>
there earlier this year and got that box. Quite the vertical hike<br/>
(you'll see what I mean), but well worth it.  All I can say about your<br/>
putting out letterboxes is place them and they will come!  Glad to see<br/>
more Pacific Northwesterners getting involved with this really fun<br/>
hobby!  Give us more reasons to get up there.  Glenn has placed a box at<br/>
Pt. Defiance in the Tacoma area, but it would be great if there were<br/>
more than one box to look for in the Pierce/King County area.  Meanwhile<br/>
we still have plenty to hunt for in the Portland area, that's for sure!<br/>
<br/>

I went up to the Rattlesnake Ledge Letterbox in April and had no <br/>
trouble finding it.  I took some pictures along the hike and of the <br/>
view, and I have tried posting them in a file here, but I can't get <br/>
it to work.<br/>
<br/>
It is a pretty grueling up-hill climb.  I am not in great shape, but <br/>
a girl scout troop was nipping at my heels and I was inspired to make <br/>
it to the top. (plus there was the letterbox to get!)<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to some trips to the Portland area (and beaches) <br/>
in July to pick up some of your stamps!<br/>

Thanks for placing a letterbox in Seattle!  This is wonderful.  I'm so<br/>
excited.  My boyfriend, John, and I are really getting pumped up about<br/>
heading up there within the next couple months to go letterboxing in the<br/>
Tacoma/Seattle area.  I sure am glad more folks from this part of the<br/>
country are getting involved in letterboxing!  We look forward to<br/>
hearing about your letterboxing adventures, whether finding or placing!<br/>
