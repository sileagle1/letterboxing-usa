This source advertised on the Carving List:<br/>
elarairah@aol.com<br/>
phone: 888-644-8779 (S. Central PA)<br/>
3 sizes in stock (this was 3/24)<br/>
4" by 4" by 1/2 ", weight 6 oz. $2.60<br/>
2 1/2 by 5 by 3/4 weight 8 oz  $4.50<br/>
4 by 6 by 3/4 weight 14 oz. ($?)<br/>
And Mars Staedtler has a number (for info on location<br/>
of retailers: 1-800-776-5544 <br/>
<br/>
I've had one block of UW (now MarsCarve) and think the<br/>
advantages for letterboxing are the sizes available, that<br/>
it's easy to carve ~ soft but not marshmallowy (how's that<br/>
for esoteric?) and quite satisfactory for most efforts,<br/>
and it's thick enough that the block will serve as a mount. <br/>
The disadvantages are that one will likely have difficulty<br/>
carving very detailed stamps (like small text ...) and <br/>
the printing can get kind of squooshy (fine lines squish,<br/>
outside edges may print, that kinda thing ... ) because it is<br/>
softer than Mars and other like materials.<br/>
