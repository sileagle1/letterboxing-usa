Street directions : From rte 195 in Mansfield Center take rte 89 at <br/>

Pass the library and the school  and cross over the dike. About a <br/>
mile or so further is Mt. Hope Park on the right pull in and park <br/>
your car. Remember to carry out your litter and leave no trace of <br/>
your visit. This is the newest of Mansfield's parks opened September <br/>
of 2002. An addition to their  impressive open space and farmland <br/>
preservation programs in town. We thank them for their efforts and <br/>
the pleasure they provide us with.<br/>
<br/>
    It was a crisp fall evening and hoof beats could be heard coming <br/>
down the Warrenville Rd. The horse and rider pulled off into the <br/>
meadow and picked up the small trail near the road   that would lead <br/>
them home. As he crossed the bridge the scent of wood smoke filled <br/>
his nostrils and reminded him of the warmth of family, home and <br/>
hearth he was so close to. He crossed the second bridge and stopped <br/>
and looked out over the farm meadow. He turned  at 40 degrees and <br/>
followed the fence line around the bend and toward the house. He <br/>
pulled up,  next to the Sugar Maple and dismounted. With his right <br/>
shoulder to the maple he took the nine paces to the hitching post at <br/>
340 degrees.  ( down  in the leaves now)  looping his reins once <br/>
through the iron ring he was thinking of dinner and the warm fire <br/>
when the door opened. " Hello I thought I heard the horse out here, <br/>
dinner is ready "  with the dooryard flooded with the light of the <br/>
candle lantern a Little Moth flitted in the light and passed right by <br/>
the horses face. " what was that?  - oh just a little moth in the <br/>
night"  The restless horse impatiently shuffled his feet wanting to <br/>
eat and be turned out for the night. When the moth passed his face he <br/>
backed up and with the reins so loosely wrapped they slipped through <br/>
and he  was free. " NoGoblin you come back ! " But the black <br/>
little horse knew the meadow grass was damp and sweet and trotted <br/>
into the dark of night." So much for a warm dinner   may I take the <br/>
lantern to search for Goblin?  Thanks" .  As the light in the <br/>
dooryard dimmed the Little Moth flitted to the fence posts at 40 <br/>
degrees and rested at the base in darkness.  ( be sure to stamp <br/>
privately and replace the lid tight re-hide for the next  person to <br/>
find)<br/>
<br/>
    The young man went back to the opening to the meadow one of his <br/>
brothers white marks was here as well. He stepped into the meadow on <br/>
the mowed path trying to keep the autumn dew from soaking his feet. <br/>
At the T in the path he went right down through the meadow calling to <br/>
Goblin. He cut a straight path down towards the pond as he heard the <br/>
distant hoof beats and the swish of the tall grasses. Goblin eluded <br/>
him longer.  His swaying lantern cast a swath of light and he saw <br/>
mothers bench at the edge of the pond. Close inspection of the sod <br/>
here showed fresh hoof prints from Goblin . He was close by .  He sat <br/>
on the bench and called in a soft plaintive voice and Goblin nickered <br/>
a response that was almost a laugh and trotted off further. At this <br/>
point our young man walked off toward the sound of Goblin but he only <br/>
went  a few steps and his bootlace was loose. At 60 degrees go 11 <br/>
paces look to the right the lantern was set here while the boot was <br/>
laced and tied once more.  While on one knee to tie his lace  , David <br/>
the young man saw a Monarch butterfly unfold his wing and air them in <br/>
the light of his lantern.  <br/>
( down and under in a rock blocked cave is our Monarch- stamp and <br/>
seal tightly before hiding again)  <br/>
        Then in a burst of energy Goblin raced past bucking and <br/>
cavorting in the cool night air.  Back at the bench ,  David <br/>
proceeded in his candle light path at 260 degrees he went on about 16-<br/>
18 paces to a path on the left. He crossed the muddy patch and saw <br/>
Goblins footprints again. Luckily there were planks to keep his feet <br/>
out of the mire.  He passed the bench under the White Pine that cast <br/>
and   haunting  shadow in the glow of a candle. The trail here was  <br/>
made by his brother but as of yet he had not marked it. The narrow <br/>
brushy way showed signs of Goblins passing.  He crossed   another <br/>
plank bridge and came to the meadow opening by the new gate.  He set <br/>
his sites at 140 degrees where he could hear Goblin and headed off <br/>
across the pasture.  The wall of evergreens father had planted made a <br/>
dark barrier in the growing moonlight. Just before reaching it Goblin <br/>
reared in the moonlight, this was such a fun game to play for a horse <br/>
and his boy!  He turned and ducked into a path just to the left of <br/>
the evergreen windbreak.  David heard stone hitting the water as <br/>
Goblin played on the dam of the pond.  His candle was half burned as <br/>
he crossed the dam in the night . Luckily the sky was clearing and <br/>
more moonlight flooded the scene.  He passed by two turns to the <br/>
right thinking  Goblin must be headed to the river instead.  He <br/>
passed the thick stand of Christmas trees grown skyward and to big <br/>
for use on his left it was darkest here.  He passed the large pine on <br/>
his right and another on the left. Just before the orange marker of <br/>
his neighbors property Goblin turned right onto the path to the <br/>
river.  David could hear the long  gulping  slurps as Goblin quenched <br/>
his thirst at the rivers edge. Then  the game was on again.  David   <br/>
followed the river bank at 240 degrees though only a fishermans rough <br/>
grown trail was there to follow. He came to the place where a large <br/>
tree fell across the river and could go no further he turned right up <br/>
onto a more easily traveled path.  This section would never be <br/>
traveled in high water. David followed Goblin along the path  <br/>
downstream to pass a broken bench.  At the next intersection Goblin <br/>
turned off right away from the water When he came to the mowed path <br/>
again he went off trail at 20 degrees up a small rise to a four trunk <br/>
tree.  Here David stopped to catch his breath and the Goblin could be <br/>
heard eating grasses nearby. In the light of  the Lantern a Lunar <br/>
moth unfurled his wing to put on his nightly show. The king of night <br/>
fliers slipped through the crotch of the tree and came to rest there. <br/>
       Goblin returned to the trail and headed back   over the dam . <br/>
He went along just a bit then veered off onto a white marked trail <br/>
again ( left). Goblins game was tiring   both himself and David as he <br/>
trudged the  trail of hoof prints.  On the trail in the woods it was <br/>
quite dark . The moon couldn't penetrate the dark foliage. Up and <br/>
down the small rises in the land,  David followed Goblin.  The open <br/>
field was not far on his right and there were trees and rocks on the <br/>
left.  In the darkness ,  David could make out a pair of twin trees <br/>
on the left with a boulder the size of a covered wagon next to it.  <br/>
He  stumbled through the growth and rested with his  right shoulder <br/>
against the tree. Goblin nickered a soft greeting to David and pawed <br/>
the ground as if impatient. David's hope began to rise that Goblin <br/>
had finally   given up the game. Peering through the darkness,   <br/>
David caught the flicker of Goblins eye in the night. He talked <br/>
soothing to him and   slowly walked in the direction ( 160 degrees)  <br/>
of his sounds.  14 paces up the rise to a rock pile and David found <br/>
Goblin with his reins tangled in   a rock pile and stuck unable to <br/>
move.  Caught at last David stopped to rest here a moment ( you can <br/>
gather your stamp while you rest)  and then led Goblin  off to the <br/>
barn. Hay for him and dinner for David. <br/>
