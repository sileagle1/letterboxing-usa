<br/>
	Here is the poop on that little frog that is guarding this Letterbox. He<br/>
got a new "GREEN" stamp pad today! So now two changes have been made in<br/>
the letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
They are:<br/>
<br/>
1) The stamp has changed from a Deer to a Frog<br/>
<br/>
and <br/>
<br/>
2) The ink pad was Red and is now Green<br/>
<br/>
This little Day Area is getting really nice now, no bugs though for the<br/>
frog. He needs some nice attention to keep him in good shape. Will have<br/>
to help him a bit the next time we visit. He needs a little fence or<br/>
something to keep him over the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Bud was enjoying the trail today!<br/>
