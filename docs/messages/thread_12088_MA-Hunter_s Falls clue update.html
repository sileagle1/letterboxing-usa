visit and to take advantage of my semi-yearly "care and feeding" of <br/>
my letterboxes.  I made Mary follow my clue sheets to take advantage <br/>
of a fresh pair of eyes to see if the clues were still relevant.<br/>
<br/>
Hunter's Falls Letterbox needs *one* tiny change in the clues.  It is <br/>
amazing how quickly the decomposition of cut trees occurs in a single <br/>
year in New England.  Simply eliminate the word "FRESHLY", as <br/>
in "freshly cut tree" from the clues.  The previously "freshly" cut <br/>
tree is now looking more like a rotten old tree stump, and this clue <br/>
threw Mary off, and rightly so.<br/>
<br/>
All the rest are still dead on accurate, and Mary even found the <br/>
Woody Hitchhiker at Marathon (waves to CSCM and Rustypuff).<br/>
<br/>
Also to CSCM - Yes, the box at Angel's Lookout was broken, but <br/>
fortunately all the extra bagging kept the contents dry.  I replaced <br/>
the box.  And I also added a few dozen more stickers to the Peace on <br/>
Earth Box - thanks for the heads up.<br/>
<br/>
The Woody Hitchhiker has been let loose today, at one of my boxes - <br/>
but which one?  You'll have to search and find out!<br/>
