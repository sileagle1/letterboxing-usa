and have copied it for inclusion in my future clues (maybe edit into <br/>
the old one too.)  Someone else said to mention the yahoo group <br/>
sites - which I will.  Waiting to put in the letterbox itself is TOO <br/>
LATE.  Newbies need to be reading before they hit the trail.<br/>
() ( ) () ( ) applause to the one who first drafted this idea.<br/>
