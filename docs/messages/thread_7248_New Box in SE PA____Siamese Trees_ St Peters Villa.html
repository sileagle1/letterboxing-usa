St. Peters Village, PA  (Chester County)<br/>

Youll find abundant parking in this quaint little village.  A great<br/>
place for hiking, lunch or just browsing the shoppes. Perhaps a dip in<br/>
the stream after your hike.<br/>
<br/>
Head northeast up the main road past the business district.<br/>
<br/>
Approximately 92 paces past the gutterless red building youll find a<br/>
trail leading off into the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Dont go the direction that the road signs point.  At the Y, stay right<br/>
lest you want to return from where you came.<br/>
<br/>
Youll know youre on the right path because youll come to where the<br/>
iron horse used to cross the river.  Tip:  dont walk down the middle!<br/>
<br/>
Stay true to the path that you are on.  Keep heading west, this path<br/>
will guide you for some time.<br/>
<br/>
At the split, follow the river that used to be.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the iron pipe and continue west.  Now look for the trees that<br/>
share their love best.<br/>
<br/>
Looking through the trees legs, chart a course for 338 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
From the base of the trees, follow your course for 47 paces (as the crow<br/>
flies).<br/>
<br/>
Have a seat on the rocks and you may find what youre looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Firm footing is a must, as you will be hiking on some loose rock.  Be<br/>
sure to bring your compass.  We rate this one a 1  on the difficulty<br/>
scale.  Round trip hike time is a little more than 1 hour (barring<br/>
complications).  Good starter letterbox or an easy one for the kids.  If<br/>
youre there on the weekend (during season), make sure you check out the<br/>
antique pinball arcade.<br/>
