&gt; This idea has been discussed before and i believe it is a good one to<br/>
&gt; pursue with the understanding that BSA has its own review process for<br/>
&gt; merit badges and may, ultimately, have its own reasons for accepting<br/>
&gt; or rejecting a badge proposal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We, Erik &amp; I, have taken some of our Cub Scout NOW Boy Scouts boxing<br/>
&gt; with us and it has presented good opportunities for map reading,<br/>
&gt; compass, etc.  Its always nice to have some diversions on a hike.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How many Eagles, Order of the Arrows, Leaders, Advancement Officers do<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; we have out there? One (Erik) here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; North American boxing seems to be devoted to permanent boxes however,<br/>
&gt; one must remember that many Dartmoor boxing events are for a limited<br/>
&gt; time.  Also, the Valley Quest boxes combine natural history and<br/>
&gt; community history in their boxing series.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A merit badge itself will take a long time to accomplish.  However,<br/>
&gt; boxing could be used as a way to help meet various criteria for other<br/>
&gt; badges.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Erik has begun looking at the badge process and I know he would be<br/>
&gt; happy to see a group work on the idea.<br/>

My scouting experience is limited but is it acceptable for  scouts to add <br/>
Non-scout merit badges to their sashes?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am an assistant scoutmaster for the troop that i was<br/>
in as a boy. I have also served in other leadership<br/>
positions at our local summer camp and am a merit<br/>
badge counselor as well. I think that one question<br/>
that we need to ask ourselves in regard to making a<br/>
Letterboxing merit badge is this: Will this merit<br/>
badge, like all the others, support the main purpose<br/>
of scouting and compliment all the other badges on the<br/>
trail to Eagle and beyond? Will this badge help turn<br/>
young men into well rounded American citizens? I think<br/>
that we all would like to see more and more people<br/>
become involved in letterboxing because we ourselves<br/>
are so excited about it! However, scouting already has<br/>
a full compliment of merit badges that can guide the<br/>
scout or adult later in life toward the interest in<br/>
Letterboxing as a hobby. The BSA would probably also<br/>
have issue with letterboxing as a violation of the<br/>
Leave No Trace code of ethics. I have tossed the LNT<br/>
code around in my head as well but have since<br/>
dismissed other people's ideas of letterboxing as<br/>
leaving trash in the woods. So, there's my monthly<br/>
blurb... figured i'd let everyone know i'm still alive<br/>
and boxing and continually supporting the hobby with<br/>
the clues found in my Eastern Mountain Sports store in<br/>
Waterfrod, CT. Happy boxing all!<br/>
