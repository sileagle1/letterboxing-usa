illness.  My husband has been busy trying to coax me back out onto <br/>
the trail.  Imagine my surprise on one of our forays last week when I <br/>
happened upon Rosie in The Underwear Drawer mystery box!  <br/>
<br/>
While we were somewhat disappointed at not being first to the box <br/>
(Sarbear beat us by mere hours!)we were very excited to have the <br/>
added wonderous surprise of Rosie Ruiz!<br/>
<br/>
Rosie left with my parents on a trip through New England.  Who knows <br/>
what box she'll pop up in next?<br/>
