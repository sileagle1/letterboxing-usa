5 hours searching the archives &amp; websites trying to find it's origins<br/>
and have come up empty, I just cannot find where the<br/>
'LetterboxCongrats-1.pdf' file came from.  As I remember and evidently<br/>
I'm wrong, I thought it came from the files section here (the talk<br/>
group).  These are not the labels in the files section now.  The file<br/>
consists of 4 labels inside a black border.  The text says: <br/>
<br/>
"Congratulations! You have found the secret   XYZ   Letterbox.  Please<br/>
do not disturb or remove this box. Instead, leave an impression of<br/>
your rubber stamp "signature" and any comments you may have about your<br/>
experiences here.  You can find out more about the sport of<br/>
letterboxing, as well as clues to hundreds more letterboxes hidden<br/>
throughout the United States at: www.letterboxing.org.  After you have<br/>
finished reading the logbook and leaving your comments, please return<br/>
this box to its hiding place.  Be discrete so that you do not reveal<br/>
the location of the letterbox to passersby.  Please return everything<br/>
to its undisturbed state so that the box will remain well hidden for<br/>
the next visitors."<br/>
<br/>
I've placed those words onto a patterned background, put 6 to a page<br/>
and want to post them here and on my website so others can use them,<br/>
but before I do, I need to contact the author and ask permission even<br/>
though these labels were posted for all to use.  Is there anyone out<br/>
there who knows where the above quote comes from???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>

ps, catbead is trying very hard to ignore this *sitrep* business, as<br/>
being a feline she has no opinion one way or the other. ;-)-1<br/>
