Fox Run Letterbox  <br/>
Fox Run Trail is a .3 mile connector to Long Creek Trail, Bald Cypress Trail and the main park road.  Named after the gray foxes which live there but are rarely seen, Fox Run is an excellent trail for bird watchers.  Look for the parula and prothonotary warblers flying among the branches of the loblolly pines and American beeches.<br/>
TERRAIN: Easy: Approx. 1.3 miles. (Planted it with a three year old, took us about 1.5 hours) <br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY: Easy <br/>
ESTABLISHED: November 12, 2000 <br/>

&gt; New Box in Virginia Beach<br/>
&gt; <br/>
Way to go guys....great job on your first letterbox!  I'll be down in <br/>
December to do some planting and hunting.  It's great to hear there's <br/>
another in First Landing.  <br/>
<br/>
I got word today from Jay C. that Fort Story is missing.  I had my <br/>
doubts about that one lasting...it was well hidden, but in a pretty <br/>
vulnerable location.  I'll work on a replacement.<br/>
<br/>
I sent two hitchhikers on their way this weekend.  "Vincent's Magic <br/>
Hat" is hidden and ready to pop out to share the magic of <br/>
letterboxing with anyone who will take it on an adventure.<br/>
<br/>
"Bird on the Wing" landed this afternoon and awaits it release and <br/>
next flight to new and exciting places.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted on their travels.<br/>
