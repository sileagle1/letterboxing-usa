No matter HOW much I love my husband, the one thing that always drove me crazy is that <br/>
he's goal oriented.. when we drive the kids to camp, we drive the kids to camp... NO <br/>
STOPS!<br/>
<br/>
He can't make it this year and suddenly I have the chance to stop along the route looking <br/>
for letterboxes when I need a break driving.<br/>
<br/>
We're heading from Columbia, Maryland.. taking 95 to the NJ turnpike <br/>
to the Garden State Parkway...<br/>
<br/>
684 to 84 to 8 in Connecticut (Grandma's house)...<br/>
<br/>
Continue from CT up to the Mass Turnpike to Somerville, MA (Uncle Dave) <br/>
 then we take whatever the heck road leads up to the Maine Turnpike... turn <br/>
left at Saco, ME and off to Bridgton and Denmark Maine to deposit kids at <br/>
camp and then home again.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know any fun/interesting letterboxes that are not terribly off of <br/>
this (I'll admit somewhat random) route?  <br/>
<br/>
My problem is that it's hard to tell from the website which letterboxes are <br/>
nearby when I don't actually have a good idea of what cities I'm driving past.<br/>
<br/>
*grin*<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be appreciated!<br/>

If you can conquer the local roads, you could also pick up all six <br/>

Bergen between Parkway exits.<br/>
There may be others, check out the mystery clues just in case.<br/>

Hi Werewulf,<br/>
<br/>
You might want to check out this relatively new series in that neck of<br/>
the maine woods:<br/>
http://www.girglemonster.com/letterboxing/worldwide_maine.php<br/>
<br/>
Though I have not found these boxes, I have driven past the requisite<br/>
signpost in Maine, and it's well worth your drive in the western Lakes<br/>
region of Maine. I suspect these might be driving friendly boxes, but<br/>
you're always welcome to email the person that placed them to check<br/>
before you find them.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun in Maine<br/>
