(My sister's name is Susan.)     Will use your suggestion #1 in my<br/>
presentation on the 20th of this month. <br/>
<br/>
Started to hike today to Boulder Rock but we turned around after 5<br/>
minutes because it was very cold and windy.  Drove 24 miles and hiked<br/>
Overlook instead.  The service at the hotel was terrible, we didn't even<br/>
bother to check in.  Ha! <br/>
