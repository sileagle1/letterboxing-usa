<br/>
I've just planted two new letterboxes near my favorite "haunted" cemetery,<br/>
Gilson Road Cemetery, in Nashua, NH.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are at http://www.aisling.net/lb/NH/gilsonclues.htm<br/>
<br/>
I'll add a few photos tomorrow, to make your hunting as easy on the<br/>
environment as possible.<br/>
<br/>
(And yes, those are supposed to be headstones in the carvings.  They aren't<br/>
fabulous designs, but hey, they're handcarved. *grin and shrug*)<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
Ais<br/>

Today, I added photos, so you can see what you're looking for.  My intent<br/>
isn't to make it ultra-easy to find the two treasures, but to ensure that<br/>
nobody goes digging or taking apart stone walls.<br/>
<br/>
Most letterboxers are responsible and use common sense when pursuing this<br/>
hobby.<br/>
<br/>
However, for those who--in the thrill of the hunt--can forget that Nature<br/>
and history have fragile aspects, I'm hoping the photos will prevent<br/>
frantically looking in the wrong places.<br/>
<br/>
I'm having SO much fun!<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>

My grandson and I visited both the Gilson Road boxes about noon<br/>
today...obviously the first ones to stamp these books.  Both boxes are in<br/>
interesting locations..I am new to letterboxing having started a few weeks<br/>
ago on the Big Island of Hawaii (Puako Petroglyph Park), then last Saturday<br/>
with my seven year old grandson in Pasadena, CA (Millard Falls Park), and<br/>
now the two boxes closest to our home in South Nashua at Gilson Road with<br/>
my youngest grandson (age 4)...We had a great time...He loved it and can't<br/>
wait for our next excursion.  I need to carve better stamps than the ones<br/>
we have now.....Yours are terrific....The pleasure of letterboxing is<br/>
discovery and sharing.  Thank you for reminding me what a lovely area<br/>
Gilson Road is despite its history as a superfund site....<br/>
<br/>
Happily<br/>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm thrilled that my letterboxes have been visited 
so quickly, Clement &amp; Jonathan, and that you're introduced to letterboxing 
now!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For those who've asked--including the always-lovely 
Butterfly lady--Gilson Road Cemetery is in Nashua.  It's not named for the 
town of Gilson, but for the members of the Gilson family who lived and are 
buried on the rural side of Nashua.  (And yes, those who know the superfund 
history are probably as aghast as I am at the house prices in that new 
subdivision! *chuckle and sigh*)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll be planting more letterboxes in this area, 
since we have many wonderful areas for hiking in and near Nashua.  I love 
letterboxing!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
<div>Ais</div></body></html>
