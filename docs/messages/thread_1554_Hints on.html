                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I  will put in $.02 too. I noticed a most recent request was from <br/>
someone 12. They may not be up to speed and I just emailed the  <br/>
details of what a mystery box is. Obviously in cruising the website <br/>
she hadn't seen that. Encourage , encourage, encourage we want all <br/>
these kids to put down Nintendo and bug their parents to take them to <br/>
the park.  Mansfield is simple by intent as I do my thing for the <br/>
children in town and my 4-H club and all my new friends letterboxing <br/>
are a bonus. I don't want my "Kids" to far off the trail. I am good <br/>
in the woods but their parents or friends may not be. More boxes are <br/>
coming , one for every piece of trail in town, that way  we discover <br/>
all the beauty of Mansfield and the hard work to preserve land in a <br/>
town squeezed by 2 universitys   it won't go unappreciated. <br/>
   I have ideas for really difficult boxes  and I hope to get to them <br/>
someday soon , they will be the "Grad School" of boxing here.<br/>
    one of my new boxers is already picking away at R.I. and  started <br/>
Newport, she's in 6 th grade. It is such a  addictive hobby You will <br/>
see all these Newbies really flourish  and the box numbers will <br/>
certainly multiply.  Well enough said , off to the barn and work. <br/>

    Just have to add that the 12-year-old is now up to speed about mystery<br/>
boxes.  We've actually solved one and are waiting for the chance to go find<br/>
it.  Now about Fete de Jardin... As an ex-French teacher, parts of it are<br/>
downright painful!  (But we may be ready to look for that one as well)<br/>
    I can't praise this whole thing enough.  It's a great family activity,<br/>
and has taught the kids so much.  Took no time at all for them to learn how<br/>
to read a map, use a compass (especially when it meant finding the box or<br/>
not), follow a trail, etc.  Kathryn's vocabulary now includes "cairn",<br/>
"sliprock", "glacial erratic", "promontory", and who knows what else?  And<br/>
we were pleased that she was the first to notice when we took a wrong turn<br/>
on the way back from a somewhat long hike.  Mom and Dad felt downright<br/>
senile when she asked "Don't you remember that log?  Or that big rock?"  No!<br/>
We don't!!<br/>
    Oh well, back to work.  And it is such a lovely day...   Ann T<br/>
