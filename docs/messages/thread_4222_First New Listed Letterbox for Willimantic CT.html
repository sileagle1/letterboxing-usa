<p>Willimantic River Trail</p></b>
<p>Placed: 1-18-02</p>
<p>Placed By: Chuck Straub and his dog Molly</p>
<p>Location: Willimantic Connecticut, Windham County</p>
<p>Rated: Easy</p>
<p>Just near the town line of Willimantic and Columbia on Route 66 pull into a 
local home and garden, feed and landscaping store called Mackey’s. As you pull 
in you will see a huge billboard on your left. Park at the end of the billboard. 
You will see a wide grassy path going down to the Willimantic River. Down by the 
river bear left and follow the unmarked trail. There are no other trails off 
this path from here to your destination. The trail will never be out of sight of 
the river. The river will always be on your right. Go along the river trail 
underneath Route 66 and follow that trail until you come to an abandoned 
railroad trestle, its’ beams still spanning the river remnants of the old Air 
Line. You will be underneath this trestle. Facing the stone foundation on your 
left, go up the steep right side of the embankment to a fence. You are very 
close to the prize and can see the trees in which it is hidden very well. Go 
along the side of the fence going away from the river to a spot where there are 
3 trees seemingly growing from one spot. In between these trees is the letterbox 
covered by wood and twigs. The trip to the letterbox should take you 15 to 20 
minutes one way. </p></div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Way to go, Chuck (and Molly)! With that amazing bridge, there just <br/>
had to be a letterbox in Willimantic. For those who don't know, <br/>
Willimantic is one of those down-on-its-luck former industrial towns <br/>
in decline...yet somehow they managed to build the biggest piece of <br/>
whimsical folly I've ever seen. This picture doesn't do it justice, <br/>
but here's why there HAD to be a letterbox in Willimantic:<br/>
