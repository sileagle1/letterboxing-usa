<br/>
Amanda (from Seattle!) and I found the box back in March (I think it <br/>
was March) when I went to hide the Tom McCall Perserve box, and it <br/>
was alive and well as of then.  Based on your descriptions, I think <br/>
you may be looking in the wrong spot.  I vaguely remember a garden, <br/>
but it wasn't near the letterbox.  Maybe Amanda from Seattle <br/>
remembers more of the details than I do, though.  I do remember <br/>
Amanda and I thinking it was slightly challenging to find the right <br/>
spot, and we weren't entirely sure we were looking in the right place <br/>
until we actually found it.<br/>
<br/>
We were also the first to find the box, so it's not a high-traffic <br/>
box.  It's very likely nobody has been there since Amanda and <br/>
myself.  Which is a shame, because it's a beautiful stamp!  =)<br/>
