pathetic ones out there and every so often I get a good one.  You must <br/>
have seen one of those ;-)   It is great fun and planting them in fun <br/>
places only adds to the fun. Am I repeating myself ??  My biggest <br/>
problem is writing the clues. There again every so often I hit a good <br/>
idea. !  Thanks for the gracious words and thank you for all you have <br/>
put out for us to enjoy. I may bring my tent up to your neck of the <br/>
woods to camp and hunt down all the ones you have planted. By the way, <br/>
all you hunters of great stamps, you must go do the new one on the <br/>
Sleeping Giant  which has the clues as only XXX's and UUU's  The clues <br/>
are fun, and the stamp is fantastic.  I hope they put out more ? Happy <br/>
Days.<br/>
