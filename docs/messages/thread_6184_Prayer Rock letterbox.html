Prayer Rock is still in place. We checked it out (28 July), replaced<br/>
baggies, etc. All was well. The last previous visitors sometime in May<br/>
(3 cute stamps - you know who you are).<br/>
<br/>
Be of Good Cheer. Ben took along a friend - pretty smart kid, and with<br/>
a little help from me as to the meaning of the clue language,<br/>
staggered off in search. They promptly quit the search and jumped in<br/>
the nearby river to cool off, while I checked the box. And, as well as<br/>
I know where it is, walking up to it I was sure the site had been  was<br/>
greatly disturbed and the box gone. However, thanks to the continued<br/>
cunning of the previous visitors, it remains well hidden, even from<br/>
these eyes.<br/>
<br/>
It is almost impossible to follow the clue literally with the amount<br/>
of leaves that abound in the area. Its easier to see it backwards.<br/>
Good luck<br/>
