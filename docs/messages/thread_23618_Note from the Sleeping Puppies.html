 I have been going to post a note now for a while and the other day I <br/>
wrote one and just as I sent it my computer crashed and I gave up!<br/>
<br/>
My partner and I started letterboxing in June --- a friend of mine <br/>
with whom I have done several shows with  always spoke about going <br/>
letterboxing.   Finally, after about a year of hearing her speak <br/>
about it, we decided to check it out ourselves.  Need I say we got <br/>
hooked!  Now every Saturday or Sunday afternoon - if we arehnt <br/>
getting torrential thunderstorms or being baked in 90 degree heat -- <br/>
we go out poking about for one or two.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Westchester county NY and are right on the border of CT - <br/>
so we pop around to either Fairfield of Litchfield county CT or go to <br/>
ones right here around home.    We planted ONE real one so far and <br/>
have posted several Virtual ones -- which I find fun as well.<br/>
<br/>
So if you find yourself in our area, look for ours.    It's an easy <br/>
find --- being someone who walks with artificial legs I prefer the <br/>
ones that you dont need to be a mountain goat to find -- altho I have <br/>
also walked those types of trails as well.<br/>
<br/>
My co performer has gone to Hawaii this summer and looked for ones <br/>
there and she and her mom are heading for New Zealand at some point <br/>
this year to hunt for some there.<br/>
<br/>
We're just staying around here!   But I just wanted to introduce <br/>
another bunch of crazy letterbox folks -- I see quite a few are also <br/>
from CT  -- I grew up in new Milford andt here are a few there  right <br/>
by my folks house  so we also go hunting after visiting them.<br/>
<br/>
Planning on hiding more soon -- but I have to think of some good <br/>
places and themes for them.<br/>
