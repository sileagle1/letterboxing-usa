Subject: [LbNA] Re: How to Cunt (was: F counts etc)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Basically, I like to keep it simple. I don't really want to add E to<br/>
&gt; F, P, and X...or bother with a bunch of little details so here's what<br/>
&gt; I think:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I count Founds as all finds made the first time. I count Events in<br/>
&gt; with Founds (I found it...on the table) but I've only been to two<br/>
&gt; events, so it's not like it really throws the count much. I count<br/>
&gt; found hitchhikers here too -- which may have been what you found when<br/>
&gt; you happened on a box with two sets of stamps &amp; logbooks. Regular box<br/>
&gt; maintenance or checking in on other's boxes when I'm in the area which<br/>
&gt; I visited before, don't count.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Placed are boxes my DH &amp; I made and planted. I count hitchhikers we've<br/>
&gt; launched with these. BUT, if you need to replace a lost box, and you<br/>
&gt; change it's location etc. then I think it's allowable to add that as a<br/>
&gt; new placed. You are going through all the same efforts as placing a<br/>
&gt; new box, go ahead and count it. On the other hand if you need to<br/>
&gt; replace a box and you put it back exactly where it was, then you're<br/>
&gt; reusing old clues, stones, etc, that's only a half-effort, don't count<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Exchanged are those which are other people's personal stamps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It's not like you reach god status when you reach a certain number,<br/>
&gt; and 1 or 2 this way or that isn't going to put you in prison. Count<br/>
&gt; however you think is right and don't sweat it.<br/>
