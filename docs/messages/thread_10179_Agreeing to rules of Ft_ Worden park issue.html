&gt;doable.  The catch may be that most of us get the clues hot from the <br/>
&gt;talk list.<br/>
<br/>
Fudrick, I hope you do not mind me replying to you on the whole list. This is a good point. <br/>
<br/>
I keep my clues on my own site, so it would be no further work for our already over-worked volunteer webmasters. (: <br/>
<br/>
I would post the link to the clues, and the basic info (number of boxes, location, county, city, state, etc.) but the clues would not be posted directly to the list. I don't think it would be more than 2 clicks to get to agree and get to the clues. People could, of course, also email me and ask for them. <br/>
<br/>
I will let everyone know of my (hopefully successful!) discussion with the on-duty ranger tomorrow. <br/>
