adjudging no booboo too small for some loving attention and cries of<br/>
"You're so brave!" is ...... The BooBoo Box.<br/>
<br/>
Within its compassionate and inclusive depths, this box will contain a<br/>
ribbon stamp. Without prescribing any action to anyone, gentlepersons<br/>
are encouraged to ink this stamp the color which most closely<br/>
approximates their injury -- for instance, black and blue for bruises,<br/>
red for gushing arterial wounds, white for old wounds now turned to<br/>
scars, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Should anyone be moved to ink this ribbon purple, we encourage you to<br/>
keep this to yourself, though we will charitably attribute your<br/>
actions to a love of the color so favored by royalty. Doubtless,<br/>
numerous coffee books depicting the life of Lady Di adorn your tables<br/>
and amuse your like-minded friends.<br/>
<br/>
In the box's log book will be space for the story behind said injuries<br/>
-- injuries which we will refrain from labelling valorous or honorable<br/>
or anything remotely upstanding or virtuous, but, secretly, we will<br/>
name you Brave 'Boxer in our hearts.<br/>
<br/>
The box will contain various small items of succor and comfort --<br/>
recipients are encouraged to take a small token and add a new one.<br/>
Sadly, the safety of anything chocolate cannot be guaranteed -- for<br/>
the box's creator has no morals in this area.<br/>
<br/>
The box will be available to travel to the homes of those wounded<br/>
while 'boxing or while thinking of 'boxing or wounded because they<br/>
weren't 'boxing, dangit, as of Friday the 25th. We hope its progress<br/>
will be charted by Letterboxing's Third Couple and Reigning Darlings<br/>
of the 'Boxing Blogosphere, Mark &amp; Sue.<br/>

 i love it..... what a great idea. <br/>
can't help wishing it was a band-aid instead of a ribbon tho. <br/>
you are to be commended for your idea and for taking action. <br/>
