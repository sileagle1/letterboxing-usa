                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Nail Family took a trip to Oregon over the Thanksgiving <br/>
Holiday and took advantage of the trip to visit a few boxes.  <br/>
Thanks to Funhog who recommended the Silver Creek Falls <br/>
State Park series.  We took all 7 Nails plus Nailhead's sister (Le <br/>
Ongle) and 4 of his teen aged cousins along for the trip.  All the <br/>
newbies designed and carved their own Sig stamps prior to <br/>
departure and all had a great time in the hunt.<br/>
<br/>
Due to Nailhead's poor navigation (Ryan didnt say to take the <br/>
Canyon Trail or the Ridge Trail), we bypassed the first 2 boxes <br/>
and ended up at Double Falls (box in great shape).  Other folks <br/>
on the trail were just a little curious about this group of 12 people <br/>
gathered around a Glad Ware container placed on a large rock.  <br/>
A group had gathered below us on the bridge traversing the <br/>
creek and were spying us with camera and binoculars.  We all <br/>
turned toward them and waved and they sheepishly waved back <br/>
and quickly left the area.<br/>
<br/>
Since newbies who wear Doc Martins dont handle hiking well, <br/>
we backtracked to pick up the Lower South Falls box and the <br/>
South Falls box, both in good shape too.  (Too bad about the <br/>
Lower North Falls box sliding away with the stump, we passed <br/>
by that area on the way to Double Falls) Ryan does make very <br/>
nice stamps :)  <br/>
<br/>
In our haste to depart from Washington to get to our family <br/>
gathering in Oregon, we didnt take the time to go to the link <br/>
Funhog provided to translate the clues to Frenchie Falls from <br/>
French into English.  Nailhead figured that his high school <br/>
French from 20 years ago would suffice to figure it out. NOT!<br/>
We joked as we came up the canyon that we could always just <br/>
start asking passersby if they spoke French.  Nailhead got up the <br/>
nerve and asked a young couple and what a surprise, they were <br/>
Quebec'ers transplanted to Oregon.  The woman was very <br/>
gracious in helping us with the clues and we had the opportunity <br/>
to share the sport with them.  They seemed very interested so <br/>
we gave them the web address of the LBNA and encouraged <br/>
them to check it out.  With our sketchy translation hastily  written <br/>
down on the trail, we headed up to find the Frenchie Falls Box.  <br/>
No luck :(  Either we didnt get all the translation correct or we <br/>
missed an important clue but we could not find it for the world.  <br/>
By this time we (all 12 of us) were getting tired and footsore.  We <br/>
decided to call it a day (a good day, I might add with 3 found <br/>
boxes, 5 new recruits, and a possible 2 more met on the trail) <br/>
and head back home to eat more pumpkin pie.  <br/>
<br/>
Next morning we headed north again from Salem with a mind to <br/>
swing by the Beaverton area to try our luck at a few spots there.  <br/>
We stopped by at a local high school to see one of our young <br/>
relatives play in a basketball tournament.  After the game, the <br/>
young player and a couple of the new boxers went with the Nail <br/>
Family to the Jack in the Box on Farmington and Jamison.  The <br/>
folks thought we were crazy counting tables, lights, windows and <br/>
ceiling tiles!  Gotta head back down that way and check out the <br/>
other 2 restaurants so we can get the box!<br/>
<br/>
Next out to Tualitin Hills Nature Park.  Box #1 appears to be <br/>
missing.  Got #2, but #3 is also missing.  Tried and tried but <br/>
could not find #4.  Nailhead and not-so-Happy Mom got into an <br/>
argument over paces versus steps and decided to quit! ..... Who <br/>
knows what the condition is of the other 4 boxes.  Must do that <br/>
one again some time.<br/>
<br/>
Moving right along, we made one last stop in Oregon before <br/>
heading back to Olympia.  BCostley had posted a week or so <br/>
ago that he was going to pull his Movie Letterbox due impending <br/>
rains and flooding in the area he placed the box.  We send a <br/>
message to him expressing our dissapointment and he said <br/>
that he could replace the box for the weekend so that we could <br/>
visit it.  Since we didnt have a laptop we had to go from memory <br/>
of the movie.  Nailhead redeemed his navigation reputation and <br/>
took the 7 Nails directly to the box (never mind that wrong turn on <br/>
the trail that cost an extra 5 minutes looking around).  Got the box <br/>
and even picked up a little bee named Buzz that has traveled to <br/>
Western Washington and last we heard was tied up in court and <br/>
appearing before a county judge.<br/>
<br/>
A great and memorable weekend with family and letterboxing.  <br/>
Thanks again to  Funhog for inspiring and confusing us, Ryan for  <br/>
running us around in circles (very long circles) and making our <br/>
legs feel like noodles, and BCostley for making our side trip <br/>
sweeter than honey!<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be home<br/>

<br/>
Sorry about that.  I figured people would be walking around with maps <br/>
of the area!  =)  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; We joked as we came up the canyon that we could always just <br/>
&gt; start asking passersby if they spoke French.<br/>
<br/>
That is too funny!  =)  I hope the box isn't missing, though, because <br/>
I still have to go out and find it myself!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; the young player and a couple of the new boxers went with the Nail <br/>
&gt; Family to the Jack in the Box on Farmington and Jamison.<br/>
<br/>
Ummm, I'm not sure where Jamison is, but I know none of the Jack in <br/>
the Box's that needed visiting was near Farmington.  You might want <br/>
to double-check you were at the correct store, since the numbers will <br/>
be different in each of them!  If not, at least it'll be good <br/>
practice for counting tables, lights, and windows in the other <br/>
stores, though. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Yep, I tend to have a reputation for running people in large circles, <br/>
but I'm glad you enjoyed yourself!  =)<br/>
