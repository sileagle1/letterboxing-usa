                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK all of you from the Connecticut area.... We have so many talented carvers <br/>
in CT that I was thinking we could plant a mess of boxes on the AT for Ryan <br/>
(and others) to find when he hikes through the NW corner of CT.  Ryan should be <br/>
making it into CT in September, but I would think to have them planted by the <br/>
middle of August, just in case.  That way also, Amanda can get paper clues to <br/>
him, since he really doesn't have any way of getting them on his PDA from the <br/>
trail.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone up to producing a box for the event?  Also: Amanda: when he gets a <br/>
little closer, maybe there would be a way to have an have an impromtu gather on <br/>
the AT?<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought<br/>

travels and I live near the AT.  Though I am no master carver - I'd be willing <br/>
to help out in anyway with organizing or planting boxes/events for Ryans <br/>
arrival.  I have already planted one box near Bulls Bridge on the trail near the <br/>
Ten Mile Camping area and I am aware of another just a few miles north on <br/>
Calebs Peak.<br/>
