the Ram letterbox by the Chinatown gate, 2/21/3.  (Those who know <br/>
this microbox will find this very puzzling.)  Subsequently it stamped <br/>
in to The Inventor, DC and It's a Holiday, VA.<br/>
<br/>
Today it visited and stamped into The Year of Enlightenment series in <br/>
the Bull Run Library in Manassas, VA.  These are indoor letterboxes <br/>
hidden in books on the shelves.  Very cool.  <br/>
<br/>
There was no place to leave the traveler so it will continue with the <br/>
Doubtful Guests until a suitable letterbox is found to leave it with.<br/>
