today.  everything in fine condition.  Sorry to hear vandals had <br/>
previously struck and scattered contents of boxes!  the chimneys <br/>
inthemiddle of the woods were most eerie. I walked face first into 2 <br/>
huge sticky spider webs spread across my path.  I am not an <br/>
arachnophobiac but this experience was yucky to the extreme.<br/>
  Finally got Cowboy's Pawprint letterbox, too.  I'd last visited in <br/>
mid-winter and could not find it.  The container is cracked but <br/>
contents are double bagged.  i'll e-mail Leader of the Pack once i <br/>
hunt down her address.<br/>
  Had a close encounter..no one, but no one was in the park.  I had <br/>
just finished stamping into a logbook in the middle of the desserted <br/>
path in the middle of the deserted woods, when a jogging couple came <br/>
barreling down the path. whew!1 Least they did not catch me poking <br/>
around stone walls and tree hollows. <br/>

   oh..socks!!  I wear white, usually dingy old white gardening <br/>
socks.  Recently bought some nice bright new white ones so now my <br/>
ankles postively glow above my grungey gardening sneaks&gt;^..^&lt;<br/>
