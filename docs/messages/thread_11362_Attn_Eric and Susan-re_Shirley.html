The Lazy Letterboxer and myself visited Shirley Center today in <br/>
search of your letterboxes.  Both boxes were found but the Town Pound <br/>
box was empty except for a few wet slips of paper that some visitors <br/>
had written notes on or stamped in on. The Lazy Letterboxer placed a <br/>
spare stamp she had carved into the box and I added a spare <br/>
notebook.  These are temporary replacements until we receive <br/>
instructions from you.  If you would like to replace the Town Pound <br/>
stamp with another, email me off list and I will send you my address. <br/>
That way, you could mail the stamp to me.  My work brings me through <br/>
Shirley Center at least once a month, so it would be no problem for <br/>
me to plant the new stamp. No problems with The Listen My Children <br/>
letterbox. It was dry and intact. We followed your instructions to <br/>
the letter and visited the Shirley Historical Society. As you <br/>
promised, we were warmly welcomed.  The woman there was gracious and <br/>
excited about Shirley's 250th anniversary celebration. However, we <br/>
did not find the names of any other letterboxers in the guestbook - <br/>
not even yours!<br/>
