in 7 months thanks all. Inherit the Earth  @ 50 foot a little further <br/>
down the trail is missing unfortunatley but will be replaced very <br/>
soon. Churchill had stopped by Bed rugg but I don't recall the month <br/>
of his visit.  Monday holiday 4-H hike will be checking more boxes <br/>
and maybe adding another to Mansfields Bounty.  Have a great day <br/>
