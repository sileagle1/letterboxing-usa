don't suspect anyone will be looking for it in this weather.<br/>

&gt;   I always complain that this series never gets traffic!  I just <br/>
got an <br/>
&gt;   email from the considerate geocacher last week who had drained <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;   container and had made arrangements for the box to be picked up.  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt;   would appreciate it if you would put a new log in.  Actually you <br/>
&gt;   could put the old one in also when it is dry and I will get <br/>
someone <br/>
&gt;   to grab it for me so that I can retire it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thanks,<br/>
&gt;   Trish<br/>

&gt;   The stamp pad is ruined.  There was a note in there from someone <br/>
who <br/>
&gt;   found it that way and it said that he tried to dry it out and <br/>
left a <br/>
&gt;   Happy Meal toy inside.  Someone was there afterwards, apparently, <br/>
as <br/>
&gt;   there was no geocache-type stuff inside.  We took the box home to <br/>
dry <br/>
&gt;   out the log book and to replace the bags and such.  Trish, if you <br/>
&gt;   want to start a new log, just let me know.  I can either put it <br/>
&gt;   back "as is" when dry or get another 3x5 book, or get the stuff <br/>
to <br/>
&gt;   you.  <br/>
