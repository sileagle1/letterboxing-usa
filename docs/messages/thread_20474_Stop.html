I think that we all too often lose sight of what letterboxing is about, at the end of the day it is all about being out on the trail, or moor, or wherever you prefer to box and having fun.  Its not an olympic sport....yet.......and neither do we get paid for it, our reward, as stated by alwayschaos, is something which many people in this world live without.........the freedom to just go out and do it when we feel like it.  Letterboxing is all about being outside, not sitting at a computer talking about it or trying to figure out the meaning of life.  Sometimes we take ourselves to seriousley.  You are very lucky to have a group like this, we in the UK have very little apart from some very good personal sites and a well put together MSN group, but talk between us brits is limited (which i feel is a poor show considering that this is the home of boxing).  Testamony to this lies in the 2 days i spent with the Bakers Dozen, the most fun I've had letterboxing to date! and thats what it is<br/>
 all about.<br/>
<br/>
It is a sad fact that there are those that are malicious enough to destroy someones hard work (website) and I offer my support to the site managers, but sadly this behaviour is just human nature, it happens to letterboxing on a daily basis - boxes go missing, people steal stamps and yet we simply replace them and carry on, its all we can do, and no amount of finger pointing or swearing will change that.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion may upset some, and for that i apologise in advance, but lets not forget the essence of letterboxing !<br/>

&gt; Seems to be a lot of unfounded accusations flying around.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Seem to be a lot of negative posts with opinions from people who <br/>
&gt; admit that they don't actively participate here and have to search <br/>
&gt; the archives to come up with any inkling of what may have happened <br/>
&gt; some time in the past. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remember, there are always two sides to every story.   There are <br/>
&gt; always things that happen OUTSIDE this "little" email list.  There <br/>
&gt; are always people who have nothing but negative to say, and those <br/>
who <br/>
&gt; try to pacify them (don't bother, it's not worth it). There are <br/>
&gt; always people who think the world it out to get them, or that their <br/>
&gt; idea is superior, or that they know better. There are always <br/>
hackers  <br/>
&gt; out there looking for a little fun.  There are always people you <br/>
&gt; won't like.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The site got hacked.  So do many top company sites.  It happens.  <br/>
&gt; It's sad that we live in a world like that, but we do. Only thing <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; can do is save, save, save your work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This whole thing is sad, very, very sad. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don't assume things you don't know to be fact.  Take everything <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; a grain of salt knowing that people, by our very nature, tell a <br/>
story <br/>
&gt; in a way that makes ourselves come out in a better light.  Don't <br/>
&gt; assume the person writing is anything, email does not tell you the <br/>
&gt; true nature of a person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be thankful to those who came before you and laid this groundwork <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; you can enjoy your hobby. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be thankful for the tireless work of the webmasters who keep lbna <br/>
&gt; working for you.  They do not get paid, nor do they often get <br/>
&gt; thanks.  How many of you can name them?  If you can name them, go <br/>
&gt; thank them instead of bashing them. They have lives outside of <br/>
&gt; letterboxing yet they give to YOU without asking anything in return.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be thankful for a listowner who allows you to post on his list.  <br/>
&gt; Doesn't have to, you know, there are no laws making him do that. <br/>
&gt; Whether you believe it or not, moderators here do their best to be <br/>
&gt; hands off.  You may think it's censorship, but it's not any <br/>
different <br/>
&gt; than what occurs on other lists (including WOL) to maintain harmony.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be thankful for Susan and her gentle reminders.  She is way too <br/>
kind <br/>
&gt; sometimes, but you can tell she truly cares.  Her wisdom is <br/>
&gt; astounding.  Stop talking and listen sometime.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be thankful that you woke up this morning and can read this.  Many <br/>
&gt; did not.  Be thankful you live in a country where you can speak <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; mind.  Be thankful you do not know what true oppression is.  Be <br/>
&gt; thankful you have something fun to do today.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Get out and plant a box so that you can contribute to the joy of <br/>
&gt; someone else.  You'll feel better.<br/>
