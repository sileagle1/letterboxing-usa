The Campsites of Selden Island<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: moderate/easy, some steep hills and bush whacking/short hikes.  <br/>
Time: Allow about 30 minutes round trip hiking time per letterbox, most will <br/>
be less.  Boating time will vary depending on mode of transportation.<br/>
Selden Island is an island on the Ct River in Lyme across from the Deep River <br/>
docks and therefore accessible by water only, although some maps and the DEP <br/>
refer to it as Selden Neck.  The north end of the neck was breached during a <br/>
severe freshet in 1854 making it and island.  <br/>
The following isn't to discourage anyone from trying to find our letterboxes. <br/>
 We only want searchers to be informed and have fun finding them.  We spend a <br/>
lot of time on the CT River and enjoy it immensely.  We want our boxes to be <br/>
found and the finders to have a safe and enjoyable time.  Therefore, here are <br/>
some things to consider prior to hitting the water:<br/>
The CT River has a lot of boat traffic on the weekends during the warm summer <br/>
months, not as much during the week.  Don't expect everyone to slow down.  <br/>
Most boaters will extend a little common courtesy but there are some who will <br/>
not.  Be wary of wakes also.  A small boat pulled up on shore can get swamped <br/>
and a larger one can get stranded when hit by a wake cresting on shore, you <br/>
may consider leaving someone behind to tend to the boat.  Early mornings in <br/>
the summer, excluding weekends, are superb. The river is like glass and the <br/>
traffic is minimal.<br/>
The coast guard requires all vessels to have a Personal Floatation Device <br/>
(PFD) on board for each passenger.  The State of Ct requires all persons in <br/>
canoes and kayaks to wear their PFD between Oct 1 and May 30.<br/>
For motor boats and sail boats, the entrance to Selden Creek at the north end <br/>
of the island gets very shallow at low tide, down to a foot or less. <br/>
If you're rowing or paddling you may want to consult a tide chart before <br/>
heading out.  It could make the journey quicker and easier.  <br/>
Two boat launches are fairly close to the island. The carry in launch at the <br/>
Hadlyme side of the Chester ferry, Rt. 148, and at the Deep river docks, <br/>
although the last time I was at the Deep River docks the launch was labeled <br/>
for Deep River residents only.  The river is also accessible at the launch in <br/>
East Haddam at the mouth of the Salmon River and in Old Saybrook under the <br/>
I-95 Bridge.  <br/>
Campsites can be reserved for one night stays by contacting Gillette's <br/>
Castle. They are all well labeled. The boxes are located to allow <br/>
letterboxers to find them without disturbing campers.  <br/>
<br/>
The Cedars<br/>
<br/>
The most northern campsite and the only one not directly on the Ct River is <br/>
The Cedars.  Enter Selden Creek at the northern tip of the island.  The <br/>
campsite is a short way in on the right.  From the campsite take the trail <br/>
that follows the creek to the west heading back toward the river.  When you <br/>
get to the small clearing on the north end of the island, head south to the <br/>
base of the hill, a downed tree to your left will show you the best route.  <br/>
Follow the contour of the marsh a short way to the left to find a stonewall.  <br/>
Follow the trail with the stonewall to your left until you come to a spot <br/>
were the wall projects about 5 feet into the trail. You'll know you're at the <br/>
right spot if you look to your right up the hill, perpendicular to the path, <br/>
to see several pieces of pipe in a row sticking up out of the ledge, an old <br/>
farmers way of setting his barbed wire fence in a place he couldn't dig holes <br/>
for his posts.  On the south side of the piece of wall that sticks into the <br/>
trail look for the Cedars letterbox at ground level.  If for some reason you <br/>
can't start at the Cedars campsite, just south of the ledge at the north end <br/>
of the island on the river side is a wonderful beach.  You can pull in there, <br/>
hike up the hill to the southeast, walk a couple hundred yards and then turn <br/>
east and find the stonewall at the base of the hill.<br/>
<br/>
Hog Back<br/>
<br/>
    The next campsite heading south is Hog Back and it's also the most <br/>
northerly one on the river side of the island.  You can pull in either north <br/>
or south of the campsite.  If you go south make sure you make a wide turn to <br/>
avoid the ledge just under the surface about 20 yards in front of the camp <br/>
site, the letterbox is planted to the north.  From the campsite follow the <br/>
path a short way along the water's edge, to a large beech tree with the names <br/>
of past campers carved into the bark.  From this tree walk northeast past two <br/>
large boulders, across the low hill, through a hemlock graveyard, to the <br/>
first ledge outcrop at the base of the hill.  If you look closely on the top <br/>
of the left side you can make out some quarry marks left from centuries ago.  <br/>
Look up the steep hill to the southeast to see a double trunked tree in the <br/>
shape of a V.  Climb the hill and from the tree look north.  The box is <br/>
hidden at the base of the ledge just to the right of the big oak tree about <br/>
30 steps away.<br/>
<br/>
Spring Ledge<br/>
<br/>
    The middle campsite on the river is Spring Ledge just past the <br/>
navigational aid.  This is our favorite picnic spot during the spring and <br/>
fall when the traffic on the river lightens up mainly because the large cliff <br/>
to the north does a great job blocking the wind and the sun shines in across <br/>
the water and keeps it nice and warm.  If you want to hear a boring but <br/>
unbelievable story about something that was lost and found here let us know.  <br/>
Your search starts at the extreme southern end of the beach, past the loose <br/>
stones and the two ledge out crops.  At all but high water notice the two <br/>
large slabs of granite left by the quarries after the invention of cement.  <br/>
Climb the ridge to the top and find the remains of a shack and many old <br/>
bedsprings. Be careful of old nails in the boards here and there.  Standing <br/>
at the western side of the bed springs the letterbox is hidden in the rocks <br/>
at the top of the western end of the ridge across the little valley to the <br/>
immediate north.<br/>
<br/>
Quarry Knob<br/>
<br/>
    The most southerly campsite is Quarry Knob.  The letterbox is planted on <br/>
the ridge between the campsite and Cold Spring, which is around the point to <br/>
the north.  From the lower picnic area at the campsite follow the trail <br/>
around the hill to the north and up to the rocky cliffs.  From the left of <br/>
the cliffs, climb up to the top of the ridge.  Look for a "horseshoe" <br/>
sticking out of a large rock.  Beside the horseshoe shaped anchor point find <br/>
the survey marker "Neck No.2".  Continue northeast over the top of the ridge <br/>
to find two stonewalls. Just past a VERY large fallen dead tree, the <br/>
letterbox is hidden near the top of the place where the two walls meet.<br/>
    If you want to continue around the island, you are about half way to the <br/>
southern tip.  Once in the creek you must slow down, as the entire creek is a <br/>
"No Wake" zone, and is ideal for canoes or kayaks.  Beware of the swans in <br/>
the late spring and summer. There is one that can be aggressive when the hen <br/>
is on the nest or little ones are around.  If you are in a small boat or <br/>
canoe/kayak there are a couple side streams to explore.  In the fall the <br/>
colors are spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
As always, remember to leave the boxes as well hidden (or better) then you <br/>
found them.  Our email address is on all of them if supplies or repairs are <br/>
needed.  Good luck and enjoy.<br/>
