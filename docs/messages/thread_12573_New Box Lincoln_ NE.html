Journey of the Saints BOX 3<br/>
Planted by Mama Bunny of 7, Harry the Monkey and Irish Bunny<br/>
Carved by RTRW<br/>
Rated: EASY<br/>
<br/>
This saint was born in Muro Italy in 1726. His father died when he was 12.<br/>
He came to be known as the wonder worker due to so many miraculous events<br/>
happening through his prayers. He is the patron saint of expecting mothers.<br/>
Do you know who he is?<br/>
<br/>
Clues: On Van Dorin across the street from the Pansing Park sign go to the<br/>
bridge. On the street side of the bridge go sown the embankment. On the<br/>
ledge under a rock is box 3. PLEASE rehide well and be inconspicuous!<br/>
Enjoy!!<br/>
