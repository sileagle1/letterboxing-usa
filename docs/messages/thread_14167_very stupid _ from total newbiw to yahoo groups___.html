me, I've never done this before.<br/>
I notice when you sign up to be a member here they give you an email <br/>
address.  If someone sends something to that address is it posted on <br/>
this board or does it go somewhere else?  Is there a difference <br/>
between posting and emailing to the yahoo address?<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
By the way, I am totally hooked on letterboxing now!  My husband and <br/>
I went out last month and found 2 of the South Mountain Trinity boxes <br/>
at Gathland (couldn't find #1, although I am pretty sure we found <br/>
where it was supposed to be), and the Washington Monument State Park <br/>
box.  We also couldn't find the High Knob box at Gambrill's State <br/>
Park.  We're positive we found the right place, so it may be gone.  <br/>
Vacationing in Georgia last week we found 6 boxes at Stone Mountain!  <br/>
What a thrill!  My husband was totally impressed that I hiked for so <br/>
long, and I told him I never would have been interested if not for <br/>
the fun of finding those boxes.  Now I've become obsessed with <br/>
scouring the internet in search of more clues!<br/>
