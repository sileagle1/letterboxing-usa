                    <div class="plaintext-content">As the Sun Dog wearies of his daily journey and the Autumn Maiden readies <br/>
her paintbrush, I again beseech ye to gather together.  My people enjoin you <br/>
to pursue hidden treasure and share in the bounty of our harvest before the <br/>
Psychokiwis depart for the lands of our Maori brothers.  Come prepared to <br/>
share your carvings and your bounty with my people.  We will gather four <br/>
hours before the moon sets, ten days after the harvest moon to celebrate a <br/>
successful hunt.<br/>
<br/>
The encroachment of the white man has forced us to flee to the northern <br/>
realms of the village of the white man's ruler.  Those who quest for the <br/>
center of our community shall find us gathered at the white man's lodge of <br/>
frigid waters beside our neighboring Indian brothers bay, here in the land <br/>
of the ocean.  At 30 steps down the way of the Beach we shall meet and be <br/>
free from the whims of Brother Wind and Sister Rain.  Meet us there and <br/>
together we will begin new pursuits...<br/>
<br/>
The fair maiden, Alafair, has agreed to share the ancient art of journal <br/>
making two hours before the moon sets.  She asks only that you contact her <br/>
to reserve your place and bring two of the white man's bills for supplies.<br/>
<br/>
For those weary travellers from afar respite can be had at area lodgings or <br/>
you may set up camp.  I will gladly provide information for interested <br/>
seekers.<br/>

ways of the letterbox, and finders of 9 so far.  We have searched <br/>
high and low (and sometimes even lower) to reap these rewards and <br/>
have thoughts of placement of our own cache on our minds.  <br/>
<br/>
So far we have found placements by SammyChamois, Warrior Woman and <br/>
The Disches, and have marvelled at the travelers before us.<br/>
<br/>
I've personally been enjoying trying to figure out the mystery <br/>
gathering location, and hope to see you there if I can find it by the <br/>
10th day following the harvest moon...<br/>

Greetings fellow finders!<br/>

&gt; Revered Beetle,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My tribe will joyfully welcome you at our gathering.  I have sent <br/>
&gt; you information for resting your weary band at your email account. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We have been forced to retreat to a white man's lodge for the day.  <br/>
&gt; It is a strange sight for my brethren's eyes as it has a kitchen <br/>
&gt; lodge in the building.  It is a strange place filled with mystical <br/>
&gt; wonders - a fireplace for cooking that is a big white box but does <br/>
&gt; not use fire or smoke!  There is another white box that turns <br/>
&gt; everything put into it as cold as a winter's night!  I am not sure <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; I dare eat food that has been enchanted in such a strange place but <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; will try.  We welcome whatever drink or food you can provide us <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; your bounty.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When my tribe has met before we have been amazed by the bounty <br/>
&gt; offered by all journeyers.  I am sure that the food, the travellers <br/>
&gt; and the tribal carvings will once again be wonderful to behold.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have heard from sister Alafair that few have chosen to learn to <br/>
&gt; make the traditional tribal journals.  She fears that many will <br/>
show <br/>
&gt; and want to do so but she will not have gathered the supplies to <br/>
help <br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
