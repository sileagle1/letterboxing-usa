I had a pipe dream after reading this topic.  How about carring <br/>
white out to cover up the questionalable language.  That would leave <br/>
stamps and pages in place.  Since I use a magazine type log book <br/>
taking out an offensive page might take out some other stamp.  what <br/>

I'm missing the backstory, but answering anyway because I keep <br/>
coming back to this topic in my head instead of simply going on.  It <br/>
would depend on whether the white out carrying person was the <br/>
logbook placer or if it was a seeker carrying the cover-upper.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be happy reading through my book and someone has <br/>
liberally applied white out over the "infected area" of which I <br/>
might have been immune to.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly than my views, what do you think?<br/>
<br/>
Heh, having said that, what is the back story of rude comments?<br/>

Ditto for me.  Anyone finding any obscenities in any of our logbooks, feel <br/>
free to white-out white-out white-out.  But does anyone really carry around <br/>
white-out with them?  I never would have thought of it.  Another thing to add to <br/>
the backpack?  <br/>
<br/>
We haven't yet had any problems that way, and I'm very glad.  Have had quite <br/>
a few comments from geocaching folks who seemed to think they were finding a <br/>
strange sort of geocache.  And one sort of negative comment because a <br/>
legitimate letterboxer didn't seem to like my placement of a box, but it was in that <br/>
place for a particular purpose, and they likely didn't realize the history of <br/>
the site to really understand why I placed it where I did -- where we decided to <br/>
place it was sort of as a joke.<br/>
<br/>
But even if it meant the loss of a stamp, enough folks around here box with <br/>
children that I'd almost rather lose the stamp if it was really necessary if it <br/>
meant losing the obscenities.  So white-out is a good alternative -- if folks <br/>
carry it with them.  <br/>
<br/>
So I guess we've been kind of lucky here in this neck of the woods.<br/>

If anyone finds anything offensive in one of my letterboxes, please DO NOT <br/>
white it out, cross it out, or in anyway deface the logbook.  Please contact me, <br/>
and I will either take care of it right away before tender eyes see it, or I will <br/>
post a warning in the clues.<br/>

I think we all all should be pretty careful about feeling entitled to censor <br/>
someone else's words.  Leave it to the owner of the logbook, unless the <br/>
owner tells you otherwise.<br/>

I would certainly agree that it definitely should be up to each box placer as <br/>
to how they would want it to be handled, but keep in mind that the original <br/>
conversation concerned obscenities scrawled across pages of a logbook.  We're <br/>
not talking "censoring" anything that wasn't done originally just out of total <br/>
malice to begin with. <br/>

Gwen &amp; I usually carry several empty replacement logs with us, and <br/>
normally when we find letterboxes that have their logs filled or <br/>
nearly filled we leave them in the letterbox along with the original <br/>
log. There was one occasion when we found the log book filled with <br/>
obscenities and we pulled the book, left a replacement and notified <br/>
the Placer on our return home. We asked what they would like done <br/>
with the logbook, and we threw it away when they asked us to.  I <br/>
believe that was  an appropriate thing to do. I believe that leaving <br/>
the logbook in place would not be the proper thing to do with or <br/>
without the placer's approval. We (letterboxing community) have a <br/>
responsibility to keep our hobby/sport/game wholesome. Finders <br/>
should carry extra supplies (baggies[inside],log books, etc.) to <br/>
keep letterboxes dry,and supplied. To require a finder to advise <br/>
that a logbook is filled with obscene writing, and not let them deal <br/>
with it seems fairly selfish(please no flames, I'm generalizing). By <br/>
the time a Placer gets a note from a Finder about the problem there <br/>
could be several groups of Finders that have read the same filth. I <br/>
guess this was my 5 cents worth.<br/>

Boy, that's the truth.<br/>
<br/>
Keith came home from "box maintenance" one either Saturday or Sunday and told <br/>
me that it appeared that 3 different groups of folks had found two of our <br/>
boxes -- the Graue Mill &amp; Fullersburg Woods ones -- all within about half an hour <br/>
of each other.  Nice weather on weekends and that can happen.  :-)<br/>

Itr appears that about half the people who have replied to this topic<br/>
would want the obscenities removed by the first boxer to see them, and<br/>
the rest (including me), would not want their logbook ever altered by<br/>
anyone without asking.  So, I have a solution for those of you who<br/>
would want to keep others from seeing such filth.  (note: I am very<br/>
much against filth and have never seen it in logbooks, and hope I<br/>
never do) <br/>
In order to warn the next letterboxer of the contents ofthe logbook<br/>
while you are contacting the placer to fix the problem, why not simpy<br/>
wrap a piece of paper around the logbook and write in big, bold<br/>
letters, "CATUION, OFFENSIVE MATERIAL HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN LOGBOOK,<br/>
VIEW WITH CARE."  Something to that effect.  That way you aren't<br/>
altering someone's logoobk who would not want you to, and you are not<br/>
failing to protect finders who follow you.  Because, let's face it, we<br/>
don't need to complicate letterboxing with trying to keep track of who<br/>
wants and who doesn't want their logbooks censored.  And how often do<br/>
we need to worry about that anyway?<br/>

 Absolutely! If the box is in danger for any reason then I would<br/>
expect an experienced boxer to do first aid.  I would also trust many<br/>
boxers I know to have good enough judgment to tear out a page in my<br/>
logbook if something was offensive.  BUT, I wouldn't trust EVERY boxer<br/>
to have such good judgment, and I can tell from other posts on this<br/>
topic that other Placers would trust people in general even less than<br/>
I.  The idea I had was a happy medium, I thought.  You don't have to<br/>
do it, I was just trying to help.  Tear the pages out if you want,<br/>
even from my logbooks, I'm not going to have a cow.  I just would<br/>
rather not make a blanket statement that if someone sees something<br/>
they think might not be suitable for children that they should tear it<br/>
out.  But, again, first aid or any other obvious repairs a box needs,<br/>
by all means do it first, contact placer later.  If we were talking<br/>
about something potentially harmful like poison pills in a letterbox,<br/>
then obviously do something immediately.  I'm not trying to be<br/>
controversial, but conversely, I thought I might have had a concept<br/>
that would eliminate controversy.<br/>

they don't find offense they imagine it. There are a lot of very thin<br/>

that may not be universally offensive although highly offensive to<br/>
them personally. <br/>

That is exactly my point ET.  Thank you for putting it more clearly<br/>
than I did.  Thus, if you see something that makes you feel like<br/>
something MUST be done to save the eyes of the next finder, wrap a<br/>
warning note around the logbook to avoid stepping on the placers toes.<br/>
 Or not.  It's all up to the finder of course.  But, as far as this<br/>
can of worms, I just wanted to help keep the lid on it.  <br/>

&gt; I know there are things we can all agree are offensive - as a<br/>
&gt; concept - but what's the standard and who decides it?<br/>
<br/>
I always thought it a weak argument to say that because there are<br/>
"gray areas", we can't do anything abou the "pitch black" ones.  Most<br/>
people, for instance, would think the term FUCK YOU or NIGGERS ARE<br/>
FAGS very offensive in a logbook.  Perhaps there is a handful of<br/>
people out there who think it's funny and appropriate, but I bet we<br/>
could take a poll and find, lo-and-behold, out of 1,000 people, a<br/>
measily 2 might think that's appropriate in a logbook.  And they'd<br/>
probably vote that way just to be different.<br/>
<br/>
And if it's on a page, all by itself, is it really a big deal to tear<br/>
it out?<br/>
<br/>
I'm smart enough to recognize that other comments or drawings do fall<br/>
into gray areas.  For instance, someone might write, "What a damn fine<br/>
 view!" which some people might feel is offensive and others might<br/>
consider--hey, it's not a big deal.  In a case like that--even if I<br/>
thought it was inappropriate--I wouldn't tear out the page since I can<br/>
recognize that it may not be offensive to everyone and the owner of<br/>
the box may not appreciate such "help".<br/>
<br/>
Just because some crimes fall into gray areas (e.g., stealing food<br/>
because you're hungry) doesn't mean we should let murderers off the<br/>
hook.  And just because there are gray areas in what people find<br/>
acceptable in a logbook doesn't mean we should allow everything to<br/>
slide by either.<br/>

PS. I am very apologetic if the blunt language used in this post has<br/>
offended everyone, but in context it does seem appropriate.  In that<br/>
sense, this post is a "gray area", but I think most people would be<br/>
okay with it under the circumstances. However, if those offensive<br/>
phrases were used in a post all by itself, it would quickly be deleted<br/>
and myself likely banned for using it.  And rightly so!<br/>

We experienced this very thing recently on a trip up the CA coast.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the letterboxes we found included a gorgeous and expensive <br/>
commercially bound and leather-like covered logbook.  It was hidden <br/>
in an absolutely gorgeous location that many 'non-letterboxing' <br/>
folks frequent.  The letterbox itself was GIGANTIC and very <br/>
difficult, in fact, impossible, to hide in the unique venue--crags <br/>
atop a bluff/200' cliff overlooking a beautiful cove along the <br/>
Central CA Pacific Coast.  When we found the letterbox it was <br/>
obvious that many non-letterboxers had found it.  In fact, we <br/>
thought we'd found a geocache instead of a letterbox because the <br/>
container was more like a Rubbermaid Action Packer than any tiny <br/>
little letterbox container we normally find.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, this 500+ page commercially bound logbook (think fancy <br/>
diary/journal type book) had many interesting entries into it.  <br/>
Looked like only about a dozen letterboxers ever found it but there <br/>
had been over a hundred entries by other 'non-letterboxers' who had <br/>
stumbled upon it.  Most of the comments were very interesting and <br/>
inspirational--just comments folks added to describe how they were <br/>
personally affected by such a glorious spot--like soul nurturing <br/>
type effects.  But, there were several other not-so-family oriented <br/>
entries.  Had it not been such a lovely journal I would have <br/>
immediately ripped out those pages (they were UTTERLY DISGUSTING and <br/>
in some cases violent--many mentioned violent 'crimes' people had <br/>
committed and other entries described last words/thoughts before <br/>
they 'supposedly' jumped off the nearby cliff and that sort of stuff-<br/>
-I figured they were mostly comments from vandals who thought they <br/>
were being funny) but I knew it would have ruined the journal to do <br/>
so.  Since I didn't know these planters from Adam I let the journal <br/>
go as it was--hoping most visitors would simply ignore those awful <br/>
comments--and whenever the original planters returned to check on it <br/>
that they would eliminate the entries as they saw fit.  <br/>
<br/>
In other letterbox logs, if I was able to remove <br/>
such 'violent'/'awful' comments without damaging the logbook in <br/>
anyway I have done so--but only for individuals who I know very well <br/>
would appreciate me removing those comments.  Otherwise, I've let <br/>
the comments stay.  <br/>
<br/>
The only other time I have 'altered' a logbook in any way is when I <br/>
noticed 'mystery letterbox clue revealing' entries in a hitchhiker <br/>
in the very venue where the mystery letterbox was located.  I <br/>
blacked out the 'spoiler' info on the HH log and sent it on its way.<br/>

Thank You dvn2rckr this is exactly my point. You write pasionately<br/>
about how "UTTERLY DISGUSTING" you found these entries and seem quite<br/>
confident that they were repugnant to anyone and should be dealt with.<br/>
I however find those entries fascinating as well as disturbing. What<br/>
do they tell us about society? Why would someone be motivated to do<br/>
that? At the point the first person posted something disturbing how<br/>
did the remaining poeple react and did that lead to people trying to<br/>
out do the disturbing entries. What is it about human nature that<br/>
brings out this dark side. I would be very upset to find out that<br/>
someone had removed this material from a log books, even if it was on<br/>
a page by itself or in a book that wasn't a fine leather bound<br/>
journal. It's a glimpse of the real world and what people do and think<br/>
when they are annonymous and not watched. The situation of stumbling<br/>
an a log book that is obviously repeatedly viewed but your entry wil<br/>
go entirely unwitnessed and be entirely annonymous grants a fredom not<br/>
often found and how people react to that tells us something about<br/>
human nature even if it is troubling and disturbing. Like I said it's<br/>
a big can of worms, and there will always be someone that finds<br/>
something offensive. As to Ryan and gray areas, society has agreed to<br/>
the judicial system as a mechanism to sort out the gray areas and deal<br/>
with the rare black and white but, using your own example, the Supreme<br/>
Court is strugling with how to deal with even such obvious crimes as<br/>
murder murder in their recent decision on how to punish minors. So<br/>
even this is not always black and white. These Log books are so<br/>
trivial that I don't think we need to set up a letterboxing judicial<br/>
system to deal with it, just  respect the endless varied points of<br/>
view in the world.   <br/>
<br/>
I think Eli had the best solution. Wrap a warning around the book for<br/>
the next finder and notify the owner. This would not offend me at all<br/>
and is a very wise solution in my opinion.<br/>

<br/>
The comments/drawings referred to rape, murder &amp; suicide--in some <br/>
cases going into much 'hopefully fictitious' graphic detail.  I <br/>
certainly hope most of society would find those entries disgusting.  <br/>
This is why I don't let my kids peruse the logbooks first before I <br/>
get a chance to thumb through it (especially now that one of them is <br/>
reading fairly efficiently). Yes, I find it interesting 'why' <br/>
somebody opted to dedicate time to writing such comments--I was even <br/>
more flabbergasted that those very individuals didn't just chuck the <br/>
entire letterbox over the cliff instead of just tossing their, <br/>
hopefully, fictitious 'victims' over... <br/>
<br/>
Yes, exploring why these particular individuals were led to make <br/>
some comments in such a 'public venue' would certainly serve as an <br/>
interesting sociology experiment--but I'd rather not have young kids <br/>
exposed to this stuff before they're able to clearly discern between <br/>
common mores/norms and psychological/psychiatric psychosis.  It's <br/>

&gt; using your own example, the Supreme Court is strugling with how to<br/>
&gt; deal with even such obvious crimes as murder murder in their recent<br/>
&gt; decision on how to punish minors. So even this is not always black<br/>
&gt; and white.<br/>
<br/>
Now that's not nice--you took an example of a crime and twisted it<br/>
into a grey area called "captial punishment".  Nobody is suggesting<br/>
that minors should be allowed to kill people willy nilly--that's NOT<br/>
what the Supreme Court is dealing with.  They are dealing with issues<br/>
of capital punishment which, because I have more common sense than the<br/>
average fruit fly, let's me realize that while some people might find<br/>
such a thought offensive, it does not give me the right to tear out<br/>
pages in a logbook supportive of capital punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Murder one is NOT a gray area.  How to punish those guilty of it,<br/>
however, certainly is controversial.<br/>

&gt; Yes, exploring why these particular individuals were led to make<br/>
&gt; some comments in such a 'public venue' would certainly serve as an<br/>
&gt; interesting sociology experiment--but I'd rather not have young kids<br/>
&gt; exposed to this stuff before they're able to clearly discern between<br/>
&gt; common mores/norms and psychological/psychiatric psychosis.  It's<br/>

At the risk of stirring up a whole new hornet's nest, why assume that <br/>
people involved enough with their kids to box with them would allow <br/>
those same kids to run through a notebook full of obscenities without <br/>
knowing what was up? If a glimpse is gotten by a child who opens the <br/>
book before you can say boo, it's easy enough to deal with, but I can't <br/>
imagine anyone here (or, frankly, anyone I've met on the trails) just <br/>
allowing a young kid to sit and read these diatribes and not know what <br/>
was up until the kid had read for an hour and asked a question....... <br/>
If I was the kind of person to look for something to be offended about, <br/>
it might be the assumption that parents are just so darn uncaring <br/>
towards their kids or that we'd be grateful for someone assuming that <br/>
their personal decisions are the right ones for everyone. Your Black <br/>
and White might be someone else's teaching moment........<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I am radical enough to believe that it's also my <br/>
responsibility to monitor my kid's books and TV and such. As with this <br/>
issue, a discussion and a heads-up that something contains certain <br/>
material is fine and often helpful. Banning an adult book or show <br/>
because a kid *might* see it isn't. If this happened to my logbook, I'd <br/>
be ok with a warning note being included and I'd be happy to get an <br/>
email letting me now what was up so I could make any changes I wanted <br/>
to. Although I might ultimately make the same editing choices you <br/>
would, I'm not so sure I'd be fine with someone besides me editing my <br/>
logbook. If you have been *told* that someone is ok with you editing <br/>
their book, then that's their choice.<br/>

it's something as piddly as a favorite color or favorite type of <br/>

offend some other living organism out there who also holds an <br/>
opinion.  This, too, is why so many folks have refrained from <br/>
participating on the LBNA-usa discussion board for so many years.  <br/>
It's difficult to discuss things in this venue without being <br/>

Not me. You're entitled to your opinion, as is everyone here. I <br/>

Any particular reason you think your view hasn't been considered even <br/>
by those who disagree? Just as, hopefully, you have considered various <br/>
opinions before forming yours, so have many who disagree with you.<br/>

I had assumed it was, hence my post. If a polite and explained <br/>
disagreement is reason to just leave, then it's not a discussion you <br/>
were looking for....... I haven't read any flames or unreasonable <br/>
attacks  yet.<br/>

&gt; I'm smart enough to recognize that other comments or drawings do fall<br/>

 In a case like that--even if I<br/>

I agree with Ryan.  Language, like many other things, can be used for good or evil.  We <br/>
post on "discussion boards," where there ought to be free exchange of perspectives.  We <br/>
run into trouble when it is dominated by opinion and without healthy, thoughtful <br/>

I agree completely that we should be able to use the reasoning ability<br/>
you obviously possess to decide whether or not a page would be best<br/>
torn out.  I have that ability, and I would guess most of us<br/>
discussing this topic do as well (demonstrated by the depth of thought<br/>
some of these posts have reached).  I guess what some people were<br/>
saying is that they feel hesitant to trust that everyone will have<br/>
such good judgment.  As you said, there are likely those who share our<br/>
hobby who would consider yanking a page because it said "damned fine<br/>
view".  Perhaps I misinterpreted this topic as an attempt to define a<br/>
safe course of action we could follow in the event of discovering<br/>
potentially scarring filth in logoobks.  If people are worried about<br/>
the placer's wishes, then perhaps you could use my suggestion. <br/>
Obviously, as we always come back to, there are no rules governing all<br/>
of us.  So, even if we did all agree on a modus operandi, those who<br/>
were mentioned above would very likely not even know about it, and if<br/>
they did, very likely decide they possess the reasoning faculties to<br/>
deem a page worthy of destruction.  The concept just popped into my<br/>
head as a way to "safely" warn future finders (for those of us who<br/>
would care so muc about others of us), and to avoid logbook editing<br/>
that might potentially upset the creator of said logbook.  Anyway, I'm<br/>
done posting/reading about this topic :)  It has been quite thought<br/>

&gt; We experienced this very thing recently on a trip up the CA coast.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the letterboxes we found included a gorgeous and expensive <br/>
&gt; commercially bound and leather-like covered logbook.  It was hidden <br/>
&gt; in an absolutely gorgeous location that many 'non-letterboxing' <br/>
&gt; folks frequent.  The letterbox itself was GIGANTIC and very <br/>
&gt; difficult, in fact, impossible, to hide in the unique venue--crags <br/>
&gt; atop a bluff/200' cliff overlooking a beautiful cove along the <br/>
&gt; Central CA Pacific Coast.  When we found the letterbox it was <br/>
&gt; obvious that many non-letterboxers had found it.  In fact, we <br/>
&gt; thought we'd found a geocache instead of a letterbox because the <br/>
&gt; container was more like a Rubbermaid Action Packer than any tiny <br/>
&gt; little letterbox container we normally find.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyways, this 500+ page commercially bound logbook (think fancy <br/>
&gt; diary/journal type book) had many interesting entries into it.  <br/>
&gt; Looked like only about a dozen letterboxers ever found it but there <br/>
&gt; had been over a hundred entries by other 'non-letterboxers' who had <br/>
&gt; stumbled upon it.  Most of the comments were very interesting and <br/>
&gt; inspirational--just comments folks added to describe how they were <br/>
&gt; personally affected by such a glorious spot--like soul nurturing <br/>
&gt; type effects.  But, there were several other not-so-family oriented <br/>
&gt; entries.  Had it not been such a lovely journal I would have <br/>
&gt; immediately ripped out those pages (they were UTTERLY DISGUSTING and <br/>
&gt; in some cases violent--many mentioned violent 'crimes' people had <br/>
&gt; committed and other entries described last words/thoughts before <br/>
&gt; they 'supposedly' jumped off the nearby cliff and that sort of stuff-<br/>
&gt; -I figured they were mostly comments from vandals who thought they <br/>
&gt; were being funny) but I knew it would have ruined the journal to do <br/>
&gt; so.  Since I didn't know these planters from Adam I let the journal <br/>
&gt; go as it was--hoping most visitors would simply ignore those awful <br/>
&gt; comments--and whenever the original planters returned to check on it <br/>
&gt; that they would eliminate the entries as they saw fit.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In other letterbox logs, if I was able to remove <br/>
&gt; such 'violent'/'awful' comments without damaging the logbook in <br/>
&gt; anyway I have done so--but only for individuals who I know very well <br/>
&gt; would appreciate me removing those comments.  Otherwise, I've let <br/>
&gt; the comments stay.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only other time I have 'altered' a logbook in any way is when I <br/>
&gt; noticed 'mystery letterbox clue revealing' entries in a hitchhiker <br/>
&gt; in the very venue where the mystery letterbox was located.  I <br/>
&gt; blacked out the 'spoiler' info on the HH log and sent it on its way.<br/>

I appologized on the list, but I want to do it again.  It was my first time posting and i didn't <br/>
realize I sent the message only to you.  My bad.<br/>
