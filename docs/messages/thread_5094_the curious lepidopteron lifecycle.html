Want to tell all you letterboxer's who are able to get to the gather in Ct.
on  May 11 , that having the pleasure of seing this Flutterby  is very likely
to be the highlight of the day.!! Pete and Wanda gave me the honor to see,hold,and
stamp into this wonder, and all because I am Butterfly !!<br/>
Thanks leger de miaine for  a wonderful piece of art. <br/>
Butterfly in Ct.<br/>
