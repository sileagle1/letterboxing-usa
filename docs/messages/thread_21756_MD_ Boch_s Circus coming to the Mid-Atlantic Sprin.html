Laaadieeees annnddd Gen..tle...men!  <br/>
<br/>
I am Phineas Boch, Ringmaster of Boch's Circus, the most amazing, <br/>
impressive, traveling collection of skilled, physical entertainment, <br/>
magic, side show, and exotic animals to be found hidden in the <br/>
forests and parks around our country.  <br/>
<br/>
Bringing art, outdoor entertainment, and puzzles, to one region <br/>
after another, our circus menagerie is especially good for those <br/>
with a dearth of local boxum adventures or with a gather on the <br/>
horizon.  <br/>
<br/>
I have assembled from around the region and around the world the <br/>
most impressive, talented, and may I say astounding collection of <br/>
acts to be enjoyed by an appreciative audience.  You will see <br/>
amazing animals, impossible jugglers, shocking sideshows...  ["Yeah, <br/>
and bombastic ringmasters!"  "Shhh. Quiet back there."] ... as I was <br/>
saying you will be astounded by our nascent troupe of a dozen or <br/>
more performers.  <br/>
<br/>
Even now I am receiving boxes from around the country to hide in <br/>
the  Maryland countryside.  We may even have party crashers come on <br/>
their own to show their talent (hint, hint).  (I happen to know of <br/>
one tiny teddy bear who has decided to run off and join the circus <br/>
in the Animal Crackers sideshow.)<br/>
<br/>
Come one, come all to our first stop in beautiful, bountiful, <br/>
boxious, Boyd's, Maryland at the Mid-Atlantic Spring Gather hosted <br/>
by the inimitable Tempus Fugit on May 14th only a few short weeks <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
I remain truly and sincerely, your humble entertainer,<br/>
Phineas Boch<br/>
Ringmaster of Boch's Circus<br/>
