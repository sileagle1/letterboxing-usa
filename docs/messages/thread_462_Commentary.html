It is a "take it for what its worth" commentary, and perhaps a note<br/>
to remember what has happened (from my view) concerning copyrights.<br/>
You can also make your own commentary if you like.  Feel free.<br/>
<br/>
I put a note up on the main page in a prominent place that says,<br/>
"This website and its contents are copyrighted."  Many of you wanted<br/>
this (or something like it).  But, for the benefit of those who<br/>
may not have understood why we needed to do this here's an<br/>
explanation.  (I know you are out there because you email me<br/>
privately.)  Well, here's an explanation also for those of you<br/>
who have not emailed me privately, but who may be curious also.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, all of the information on this site is free to be<br/>
used for letterboxing and for sharing with other people to do<br/>
letterboxing.  When a person talks about ownership they might just<br/>
as well be stating that they own their individual letterbox.<br/>
They can go out and pull their box anytime they want (to<br/>
make a point) and then its of no value to anyone else but the<br/>
individual.  If the letterbox is not there, no information would<br/>
need to be here to provide others with a way to find it.  Simple.<br/>
The box is owned and the information depends on the box being there.<br/>
In that sense the creator owns the box and the information which<br/>
has no purpose to exist otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Some people also wanted a copyright to show that the information<br/>
(clues) as separate from the letterbox itself have some value.<br/>
We already know that the clues have value because the letterboxes<br/>
would not get found otherwise, but some people wanted the sense<br/>
to be there for others that the information they use to represent<br/>
their letterboxes on the web (clues and images) are owned by them<br/>
as individuals, the ones who created the letterboxes, for artistic<br/>
content.  In truth there is value added (of this same type) by<br/>
merely posting the information on the web, but I do not consider<br/>
that a relevant issue because my services are free and I have<br/>
insisted that anyone who helps me also do it for free.<br/>
<br/>
Well, here's the crux:  The creator of a letterbox only puts<br/>
the clues here for the sake of people finding the letterbox.<br/>
Any other value, legal though it may be described, is less than<br/>
that main value.  If this was not the case, we would just be<br/>
putting up images and/or descriptions and there would not be any<br/>
letterboxes behind them which exist for people to find.<br/>
<br/>
While the stuff on the web can be described legally, this <br/>
does not change the fact that the site is free and that you <br/>
will not get into trouble by sharing information from it for<br/>
purposes of letterboxing.  Any artistic value that may be in the <br/>
box or clues that may make it a treasured find for you or may <br/>
make you feel good because it looks nice to you or because it may<br/>
make you feel accomplished for getting a diffcult find, is a<br/>
fringe benefit of the hobby, part of the fun, and it is given<br/>
to you by the good will of the creator of the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The artistic value is something very subjective, not to be measured or<br/>
valued on a scale.  How much value do the artisitic elements have?<br/>
Its very much up to the person finding them, not just to the ones<br/>
creating them.  If not for this, people would not be putting clues<br/>
here nor would they try to make them look nice.  They want to invite<br/>
the finds and (in some cases) make them special for the finders<br/>
out of a sense of their own charity and fun and good will. They<br/>
want others to enjoy what they put their hearts into. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this makes it more clear.  We have a copyright notice now,<br/>
but the true value and the sense of ownership derives from many<br/>
elements.  Only someone trying to market something as art will<br/>
have a strict sense of legal ownership.  The rest is for sharing.<br/>
The legal description of copyright, though a valid one, does not<br/>
change anything in essence from what we were already doing and <br/>
what we had already understood as the purpose of the hobby,<br/>
Letterboxing USA style.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening and for considering these coments, those<br/>
of you who suffered through them.<br/>
<br/>
Truly,<br/>
