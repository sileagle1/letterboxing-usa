                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have been talking about it and working on it, and Darren and I are <br/>
ready to announce our first postal letterbox! <br/>
<br/>
 The idea of the box is to share the story of how you became <br/>
engaged.  We have been engaged for one year September 20, and the <br/>
idea is to get this box sent out on that day.<br/>
<br/>
We want to hear stories of how you became engaged and we would also <br/>
like to share pictures.  You can include pictures of then (if it was <br/>
a while ago) Now, or both.  <br/>
<br/>
We will include an ample logbook so that you can share as much as you <br/>
please.  <br/>
<br/>
We would like this PLB to include 25 people (October 25, 1998 is the <br/>
day we became a couple).  So, email drgdlgletterboxers@yahoo.com asap <br/>
to sign up.  <br/>
<br/>
I am very excited about this letterbox and I am certain you will <br/>
enjoy it!<br/>
<br/>
Desi and Darren   (100 days until the wedding!!)<br/>
