&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Confused! I was like that for the first couple of days. I am still<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to figure out what DON JACKSON's C stands for(caves,<br/>
&gt; &gt; centipedes, ?). Anyhow, I sometimes like to play around. L is my <br/>
own<br/>
&gt; &gt; orginal. Look at some of my last posts. It's in there for what it<br/>
&gt; &gt; stands for. Forget, I save you the time. It stands for the number <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; lizards that I have walked by. Yes, I know that a google is a lot <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; me. But I just love that word.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Information on bencmarks(survery markers for example)can be found <br/>
at<br/>
&gt; &gt; www.geocaching.com. That is were my Mom has found information <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; &gt; benchmarks.  She also freaks out when she finds a marker close to<br/>
&gt; &gt; where we are going to plant a letterbox.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, Don Jackson what does that C stand for?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lizardbutt<br/>

I'm new to this list and to this hobby, so it is not surprising that<br/>
I'm a little confused right now.  For example, what does this message<br/>
mean?  What are "exchanges?"  And why would letterboxers have stamps<br/>
with them while searching for boxes?<br/>

They keep telling us to get in touch with our bodies. Mine isn't all that communicative but I heard from it the other day after I said, "Body, how'd you like to go to the six o'clock class in vigorous toning?" Clear as a bell my body said, "Listen fatty....do it and die."<br/>

The easiest method at AQ is to go to the 'People' pull down and click <br/>
on 'Manage Exchanges'. At this location you will not have to click on <br/>
each profile page, but merely add each one in. The tally of each new <br/>
addition will show up on the right hand side of the page.<br/>
