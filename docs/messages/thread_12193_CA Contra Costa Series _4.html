   The final box in this series is now placed!<br/>
Location:  Walnut Creek, CAPlace: The Old Borges Ranch off Castle Rock RoadDifficulty:  EasyInformation:  This is a ''working' ranch.  It has farm animals to 'pet', old time farm equipment to sit on.  They have activity days, where there is stories and plays.  Dogs okay on trails, not in with the farm animals.  Great family spot. <br/>
   680N to Ygnacio Valley Blvd exit<br/>
   right on Ygnacio Valley about 2 miles<br/>
   right on Walnut Ave to 'T' at Oak Grove Rd. Turn right.<br/>
   This turns into Castle Rock Rd.  About 1/4 mile past Northgate High School there is a sign for Borges Ranch.  Turn right here.<br/>
   Follow road all the way to the farm and park on right (if crowded, there is a lower parking lot and you will have to walk to the end of the upper parking lot.<br/>
   Between the Ranger's office and a small barn on the right there is the trail head.  This is Old Borges Ranch Trail.  Go through gate and head on up the hill.<br/>
   Stay on trail Borges Ranch - Twin Ponds<br/>
   Pass the cut off for Mt. Diablo Trail and there are 2 oak trees on the right.<br/>
   Letterbox is located at the base of the second tree.  Please rehide with branches.<br/>
   This hike takes about 5 minutes to get to the box.<br/>
<br/>
A nice segue is the Castle Rock Box.  That is a tougher hike at the end so wear apropriate shoes.<br/>
