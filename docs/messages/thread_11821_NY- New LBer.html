                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've only recently (last month) started doing this too. I found my first <br/>
four in the Columbus OH area, but not the one on the OSU campus. Someone <br/>
else recently wrote that they couldn't locate it either. On my way to <br/>
Ithica, NY a couple of weeks ago I found my fifth one in Macedon, NY. I <br/>
then looked for the one in Newark, NY but couldn't find it. I forgot the <br/>
parks weren't open yet and by the time I got to looking for the one in <br/>
Sapsucker Woods, it was starting to get dark. Ithica would be a nice <br/>
weekend trip in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
 I just finished carving the stamp I'll carry with me just last night. I <br/>
knew the design I wanted so I'd been drawing it by hand in the log books <br/>
of the LB's as I found them. Now, I can stamp the "real thing". Ta <br/>
Daaaa! I may change it over time, but at the moment, it's the design <br/>
that fits me. I carved mine into Speedy-Cut with a Dremel tool.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any pointers, but one thing I'd like to see a consensus on <br/>
is: what is a "pace". I was taught that each time the same foot hits the <br/>
ground, that was one pace. I suppose, to take it one step further, the <br/>
Orienteers out there would like to see all distances shown in meters. <br/>
Wouldn't that make an interesting survey.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to get around to placing my first LB and clues, soon. If only it <br/>
would stop snowing.<br/>
<br/>
I know you'll have fun at this, I know I am.<br/>

&gt;Have you found any? Any pointers coming from a newcomer to a <br/>

At that time it looked like some construction was starting up in the<br/>
area. <br/>
I have heard it is MIA.<br/>
<br/>
A pace to me is 2 steps. It can be anything the letterbox creator wants<br/>
,but I usually spell it out in my clues so there is no misunderstanding<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
I've got an idea for your first letterbox placement ....Plant it close<br/>
to Cincinnati !!<br/>
(On the South side of Columbus )  LOL !<br/>
<br/>
Have fun ..<br/>
