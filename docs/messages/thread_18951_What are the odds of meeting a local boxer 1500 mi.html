Yup....during my mad dash to Yuma, Arizona with my dad and niece we <br/>
ran into Ryan and Amanda on the trail from/to the Laughlin Carp <br/>
Letterbox. We were leaving and they were going. We knew that they <br/>
had been in the area earlier in the day when we found the Hoover Dam <br/>
box (75 miles away) had been visited by them that morning. We were <br/>
at Hoover Dam around 1:30/2:30pm and they had already been there. So <br/>
after spending 30 minutes looking for the Laughlin Carp and finally <br/>
finding it (I forgot the compass so we hiked back to the car and <br/>
drove over to the general area) without the compass after all. We <br/>
were driving down the road and saw two people walking down the side <br/>
of the road that looked like they were counting paces/steps and one <br/>
was wearing a compass! Hmm..dead giveaway with the compass....so we <br/>
whipped a U-turn and pulled up alongside them. Hollered out the <br/>
window..."Amanda" and sure enough it was her and Ryan! So..we <br/>
quickly exchanged stamps (roadside) and got some <br/>
updates...hmm...forgot to ask why they were together in Vegas..just <br/>
assumed checking on letterboxes...failed to notice if there was any <br/>
jewelry on those left ring fingers..didn't even think of that until <br/>
after we left them to go find the box.  <br/>
<br/>
It was so fun actually meeting someone I "know of" on the trail and <br/>
even more funner considering it was my first time letterboxing out <br/>
of the WA/OR area.<br/>
<br/>
I had to immediately call MomNoTime from my cell phone to tell her <br/>
the news!! She about fell over when I told her. What are the odds?<br/>

I am looking forward to getting out of cicada-central and finding boxes in<br/>
a few new states next week. Maybe I will have a similar encounter?<br/>
