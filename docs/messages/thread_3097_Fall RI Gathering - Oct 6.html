Saturday, Oct 6 won by a vote of 14 to 5.  Now I will start looking <br/>
for help for the day in earnest.<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure how everyone wants to proceed with the planning.  I <br/>
don't know if the membership in general wants to read lots of emails <br/>
about something that only a section of the membership will be <br/>
attending.  I thought that I would ask for input from everyone.  I <br/>
could start a new egroup for planning/discussion about the Gathering <br/>
and then those who are not interested wouldn't get even more "junk" <br/>
mail.  On the other hand that would mean that those that plan on <br/>
attending or just want to keep track of what was going on would have <br/>
to join another group.  You can either respond to this post or <br/>
contact me directly with your preference.  I will handle it whichever <br/>
way people want.<br/>
