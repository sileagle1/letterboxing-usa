<br/>
Everyday I go to the letterboxing.org website and click on "what's new" to see the last 25 boxes placed.  I then do a "search for boxes" by state just in case more than 25 were planted at any given time and maybe I missed one.  I usually search for the last 10 days or so, just to see what comes up.  On June 8, a new box appeared but it was planted on 6/4/04.  It did not show up between June 4 and June 8.  Why is that?  When I physically went to the box, 3 people already signed in, so they knew about it.  <br/>
<br/>
This is not the first time this happened to me.  Someone announced on the website that they planted their first box on a given date, yet when I did a "search for boxes" it didn't appear on that search until a few days later.  I did find it when I did search by "planter of the box".  I don't understand why this happens.  Has anyone else experienced this problem? <br/>

Hi Donna,<br/>
<br/>
Good question. Here are a couple of thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
When posting a box on the LBNA site, the placer<br/>
can type in whatever they want for the placement<br/>
date, so just because the listing says the box<br/>
was placed on 6/4/04 does not mean that the placer<br/>
posted it on 6/4/04. It may have actually been<br/>
posted to the site on 6/8. Who knows, maybe the<br/>
placer gives out clues to letterboxing chums before<br/>
making the box known to the general public.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is a spot on the "What's new" page to<br/>
type in a number other than 25 to indicate how many<br/>
of the most recent boxes you want to view. This is<br/>
handy when you haven't checked the list for awhile,<br/>
you can look at the last 50, 100, or 9000 boxes<br/>
added. (You might not really want to use 9000,<br/>
though!) To use this, just type a number into the<br/>
box and hit enter.<br/>
