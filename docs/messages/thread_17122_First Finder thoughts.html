I've also started making wooden jigsaw puzzles by hand and have thought of turning the stamp in a box into a wooden jigsaw puzzle and putting a certificate in the box for the first finder to send to me to get their puzzle form finding the stamp first.....<br/>
<br/>
We've also done something kinda special, we think, for the 'Curse of the Black Pearl' series.  Each person or team that finishes the series and can provide proof of a completed stamp will get a faux black pearl necklace (hematite) that we hand made.  Being a jewelry maker of some skill, I thought it would be kewl to do this and to give something tangible to those that finish the series.  We made necklaces that we think look kinda 16th centuryish.  Hoopoe recently saw the test run and I think she thought they were nice.  Though not strictly for first finders, the necklace idea was just something extra to do to make the series different and special.<br/>
