I can't seem to find examples of stamps for letterboxing.  Is there <br/>
a link where some can be seen?  I'm confused as to what the stamp <br/>
should look like and/or say.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For your personal stamp there really are no set things it should have <br/>
or say. A lot of people have them in some way relate to their <br/>
letterboxing "name."  There are some links from the main letterboxing <br/>
site that may help you, under the kids link there are some examples <br/>
of easily made stamps. Also if you look under "getting started" and <br/>
then click on "a stamp there are some clickable links on how to make <br/>
a stamp that have examples of stamps. If you click on the one on the <br/>
second page under carving, and then  you go to the last page of that <br/>
section there is a link to Der Hand-Carved Stamps. He has some really <br/>
nice examples of stamp. Hope this helps.<br/>
