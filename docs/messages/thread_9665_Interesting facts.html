The Golden rule with an on-line group should be, take what you want and<br/>

go with the second rule, do not respond, do not give it attention.<br/>

<br/>We work all winter during the snow season and carve!  LOL  We've already had two storms this year, and it isn't even Christmas yet! (sigh)  In Connecticut, we are kind of shut in for four months, then get to plant our boxes in the spring.  The carving keeps us sane while the cabin fever sets in.  LOL
