                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  Yep, I'm another one who read the Fox News article and had my <br/>
intrest piqued. *grin*  It sounds a lot like something we did when we <br/>
were kids.  I have a bunch of sons and would like to start doing this <br/>
as a family.<br/>
<br/>
We are living in Eastern Europe, though.  (American expats. . .)  Can <br/>
anyone direct me to what websites might have info on what (if <br/>
anything) is going on in this area of the world?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Alex<br/>
