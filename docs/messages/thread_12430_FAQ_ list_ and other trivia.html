a) I plan to dust off the FAQ this spring.  If you have a suggestion for your<br/>
pet question, tip, etc., to be there, e-mail me off-list <br/>
(randy at mapsurfer).  (I've seen e-mail go by that said -- "I wish they'd <br/>
update the FAQ on this" -- if you were sending those e-mails, send them<br/>
to me).<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly -- I want links to your website or talk list if you want<br/>
it on the FAQ.  I'm prolly not gonna just add these (or will decide on a <br/>
case by case basis, if I know the person), because some people _want_ their <br/>
resources below the radar.<br/>
<br/>
(One thing I will not do is go beyond P, F, X and E -- I will add a line,<br/>
however, referring the curious to dumpster dive the archives (if there is<br/>
really strong consensus on more letters, and what they are, and that we<br/>
want them in the faq, let me know -- there was a time I refused to go beyond<br/>
P and F)).<br/>
<br/>
b) I saw someone complain about spam to the list.  We try to proactively and<br/>
reactively deal with it, but until we get a raise, I suppose it will still<br/>
be there.  If you were the one complaining about it, and it is still a <br/>
problem, let me know, I could not possibly skim 1254 messages to see if it <br/>
still is (and I got and darn good spam filter (http://spamassassin.org/), so <br/>
I may not have seen it anyway.  (And its better to complain about spam<br/>
directly to the moderaters rather than to the list)).<br/>
<br/>
c) Post technical questions about the new website to somewhere other than<br/>
this yahoogroup, unless you feel they are of general interest <br/>
(webmasters@letterboxing.org seems like a good choice -- at least now --<br/>
there may or may not eventually be a technical help e-mail address that<br/>
is more appropriate).  I know most have been doing this, but we can try<br/>
for 100% :-)<br/>
<br/>
d) How do we feel about attachments?  The choices are: leave them off, put<br/>
them back, or get me another beer (responses off-list if you care to <br/>
express your opinion on this).<br/>
<br/>
e) I recently placed a letterbox in remote place not in the US.  Since this<br/>
will be of very limited interest, it will appear on my website, but not on<br/>
the new lbna site, old lbna site, or the talk list (unless by coincidence<br/>
I can shoehorn the announcement into another clue posting ...)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
