My job -- Give out the information again and hope I get everything <br/>
straight !!!<br/>
May 17th is the Gather Day<br/>
Beautiful Hop Brook Lake, Middlebury ,Ct is the place.  [print out the <br/>
clues for Aaron's Birthday Box, and the two President                   <br/>
<br/>
  Series.--eleven boxes there !]  <br/>
12:00 Noon is the time.  Although there will be many folks running <br/>
around earlier to hunt out the boxes !!!<br/>
A per auto fee of  about $4.00  , so be ready for that<br/>
The Meadows Shelter is reserved for us.  They all have names and are <br/>
well marked. Flags will be flying .<br/>
                                                                Grills <br/>
and tables as well as electricity  for crock pots and  etc.<br/>
I found it very easy to find, just a short way south on rte 63  from I 84.<br/>
Folks are bringing all sorts of favorite food to eat and share, as well <br/>
as their own drinks. Bookworm will have napkins, cups, and plates. <br/>
 Music Woman has some jobs to do and will add pages to the log books on <br/>
the trails.  Rubaduc is even adding new ink pads to the boxes on the <br/>
trails.  We are all trying to foresee anything that needs attention. <br/>
 Beth has been working hard for this event and the fun energy level is <br/>
high up there.<br/>
I have the job also to "bring nice weather"  an interesting job for me, <br/>
for all those that know me know that I box in pouring rain, deep snow , <br/>
and soaring temperatures.  So I guess that about covers it. All weather <br/>
is Nice for boxing.  !!<br/>
Hope I covered my 'jobs'  See you all there. ~~and yes-- I will send out <br/>
one more next week .<br/>
Butterfly<br/>
oops. I already forgot :: We will have a basket to hold items for a <br/>
raffle if you would like to bring something to add ??  As we stamp into <br/>
the Event Log Book we will also put our name or stamp on a 'ticket' and <br/>
the drawings will begin later in the day.  If we are lucky, everyone <br/>
will draw a prize .. Also Beth will have a basket for us to 'exchange' a <br/>
H.H. -- bring one, take one, and stamp to your hearts content.  <br/>
