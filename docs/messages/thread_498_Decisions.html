&gt; I want you all to know that at this point in time, there are ABSOLUTELY NO <br/>
&gt; MODERATION parameters in place for this talk list.  If the previous list <br/>
&gt; abuser or anyone else should again decide to start flooding this list with <br/>
&gt; angry, argumentative posts, then it will become necessary to apply moderation <br/>
&gt; parameters again.  In the future, such decisions will be discussed on the <br/>
&gt; letterbox-vision talk list, and decisions will be made in a democratic <br/>
&gt; fashion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
I appreciate these statements, especially in light of recent events.  I think it is time for us to make some decisions about how decisions will be made.  What do we mean by a democratic fashion?  I think the letterbox-vision list is probably meant as a forum for this type of discussion, but is that list open to all?  If not, can everyone at least follow the discussion on there?<br/>
<br/>
Here comes a word I know many don't want to hear...RULES.  Yes, I think we need to talk about rules.  Not rules about letterboxing, we've talked about that and the I think the consensus is that we don't want very many.  I'm talking about rules about the list.  How do we conduct ourselves?  How do we make decisions?  How do we deal with behavior we feel is inappropriate?  Should any individual have the power to make decisions about the list on their own, without consulting the membership?<br/>
<br/>
We're growing... And part of that growth process is a need for structure.  This will also require some sense of leadership, but the leadership must answer to the membership somehow.  How do we do this?  What list do we doscuss this on?  And how do we ensure that all who so desire can partake in the process?<br/>

P.S.: It's been a delight to see recent postings relating to letterboxing experiences.  I truly hesitated to send this post, but I think it is critical at this juncture. <br/>

I couldn't agree more with you.  The recent problems we've had were <br/>
disappointing for all of us, and could probably have been avoided.  We all <br/>
let our guards down and allowed something bad to happen that would not have <br/>
occurred if we had set things up right in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I wish to issue a sincere apology to those who were opposed <br/>
to my methods of handling the recent string of negative posts.  Moderation <br/>
seemed like the responsible thing to do, out of respect for our many <br/>
subscribers.  I assure you that moderation was only used as a last resort <br/>
after a long, laborious, and mentally exhausting effort to find other means <br/>
to resolve the issues.<br/>
<br/>
What we need to implement as soon as possible, in my opinion, is a recognized <br/>
Board of Directors.  We need rules for how you become a member, how decisions <br/>
are made, etc.  These rules should be determined by concensus.<br/>
<br/>
This group can then make decisions regarding how to handle problems that <br/>
might arise.<br/>
<br/>
As for a membership base, we can utilize the existing <br/>
letterbox-vision@egroups.com list, or we can set up a new list, whatever the <br/>
group feels is appropriate.  In regard to who can read the archives, who can <br/>
join, etc. we can set the parameters any way the group can agree on.<br/>
<br/>
Any other comments on how to get this ball roling?<br/>
