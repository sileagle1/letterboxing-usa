I don't particularly like the idea anyone posting comments <br/>
about other people's boxes in a database.  Not only could it ruin<br/>
any possible mystique of the hunt, the potential for abuse (or error) <br/>
is high.<br/>
<br/>
For example, people posting spoilers in the database, people posting <br/>
boxes going missing when in fact they could not figure out the clues<br/>
(which would discourage other hunters), etc.<br/>
<br/>
While these abuses are possible on the talk list, the community nature<br/>
of the talk list makes it less likely that they will occur.  Moreover,<br/>
it is easy for the sponsor of a box to correct such errors and abuses<br/>
on a talk list rather than needing to monitor postings in a database.<br/>
<br/>
If such a system were implemented, the sponsor MUST have the ability<br/>
to approve all content about their boxes before it goes into the DB.<br/>

I understand your concerns and I hadn't really focused on the issue <br/>
of abuse of the idea. I suppose that the easiest way of dealing with <br/>
that would be to only allow the sponsor to post the status or notes <br/>
about the box. That would be very easy to do. Alternatively they <br/>
could approve as you suggest. Perhaps there is a better way <br/>
altogether of dealing with the issue of knowing current status of <br/>
boxes. I just know it is going to be an increasing burden on the LBNA <br/>
site maintainers to maintain the current info on all the boxes. There <br/>
are hundreds now, but thousands may not be that far off. Some may not <br/>
feel that it is important for searchers to know whether a box may be <br/>
thought missing, but I know that many, like myself, are only within <br/>
potential reach of boxes on a short vacation and hunting a box may <br/>
take an entire day away from other possible activities. I wouldn't <br/>
mind not finding one, but I would certainly rather not go after one <br/>
that is thought to be missing. Perhaps posting something as simple as <br/>
the last date found, or verified by the owner, would go a long ways <br/>
towards addressing this issue. I was just floating an idea I thought <br/>
might help.<br/>

IMHO, I think your idea of a database has real merit. A "central"<br/>
database to update the status of boxes would be helpful. This would<br/>
eliminate or reduce the frustration that occurs when someone wants to<br/>
share useful info about a box, but then has to decide where to post that<br/>
info (LbNA site, personal site, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
A compilation of ALL known boxes and their updated status would be<br/>
INVALUABLE. And links to the sites where their clues reside - great!<br/>
<br/>
As far as a "live" discussion group: I've never been big on chatrooms,<br/>
but this has my interest piqued. Are you thinking of maybe a weekly<br/>
scheduled time slot for a live group meeting? This too sounds worth a<br/>
try. May take a while to build up participation, but if it's as easy to<br/>
get up and running as you say, then go for it. I'm in!<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, I can handle the "client program" you mentioned...computer<br/>
techno-literate I am not.<br/>

I like the Dartmoor model.  A read only database.  Has a central<br/>
catalog of boxes, yet preserves the mystique and guards against the<br/>
abuses I described.  Some technically inclined folk may see technology<br/>
as a "solution", yet I don't see the "problem" :-) (and I work in <br/>
internet technology myself for a living, so I'm not exactly a <br/>
Luddite).  I guess I feel if not done carefully, technology has the<br/>
potential to compromise some of the charm.  Does it?  Is there charm?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Some may not feel that it is important for searchers to know whether <br/>
&gt; a box may be thought missing, but I know that many, like myself, are <br/>
&gt; only within potential reach of boxes on a short vacation and hunting <br/>
&gt; a box may take an entire day away from other possible activities. <br/>
<br/>
I think I see what is going on here.  Some people view letterboxing<br/>
as a treasure hunt, where the easily disappointed need not apply. <br/>
Others see it as something else (I'm not exactly sure what since I'm<br/>
in the former category, but whatever it is, they expect to find something <br/>
at the end, or else they would not care about these data being available).  <br/>
Since we are diverse and take all comers, somehow I think we need to be <br/>
open to all types, and not ruin it for either.  I'm not sure of the best <br/>
way to do that.  Perhaps a new hobby called "treasureboxing" could be <br/>
spun off :-)<br/>

<br/>
We have discussed this in the past.  While there is merit in this idea,<br/>
it might infringe on some of the clues and secrecy involved in "good old<br/>
letterboxing."  I think what would be more useful would be a fairly<br/>
rigid "degree of difficulty" clause submitted with clues.  We haven't<br/>
talked about how we would standardize it, but it could certainly be a<br/>
topic of conversation.  It wouldn't alleviate the lost box, but if you<br/>
knew going in that it was an easy box &amp; could not find it, that it was<br/>
more likely to be missing than a reflection of your lack of<br/>
letterboxability (an adjective is born!).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is more like having meeting<br/>

You cut off the most important sentence when you quoted me :-)<br/>
It was " I wouldn't mind not finding one, but I would certainly <br/>
rather not go after one that is thought to be missing." The point is <br/>
not to _guarantee_ anyone a find, but rather to have current status <br/>
info available so that people can:<br/>
1. Avoid a wild goose chase for one that is _known_ missing (such as <br/>
my squirrelfish box)<br/>
2. Make a decision whether they want to pursue a particular box that <br/>
might be missing or hasn't been verified in a long time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I think I see what is going on here.  Some people view letterboxing<br/>
&gt;as a treasure hunt, where the easily disappointed need not apply.<br/>
&gt;Others see it as something else (I'm not exactly sure what since I'm<br/>
&gt;in the former category, but whatever it is, they expect to find something<br/>
&gt;at the end, or else they would not care about these data being available). <br/>
&gt;Since we are diverse and take all comers, somehow I think we need to be<br/>

&gt;way to do that.  Perhaps a new hobby called "treasureboxing" could be<br/>
&gt;spun off :-)<br/>
<br/>
I really think spinoff is overkill. I just think that status info <br/>
would be helpful to those who care. If someone still wanted to hunt <br/>
for my squirrelfish box, knowing it was vandalized and I haven't <br/>
replaced it, then I would hope they enjoyed the scenery ;-)<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those times where a chatroom as I offered would be a <br/>
great way to discuss such things for those who care without boring <br/>
the others.<br/>

&gt; You cut off the most important sentence when you quoted me :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It was " I wouldn't mind not finding one, but I would certainly<br/>
&gt; rather not go after one that is thought to be missing." The point is<br/>
&gt; not to _guarantee_ anyone a find, but rather to have current status<br/>
&gt; info available so that people can:<br/>
&gt; 1. Avoid a wild goose chase for one that is _known_ missing (such as<br/>
&gt; my squirrelfish box)<br/>
<br/>
If it is known missing (confirmed by the author), it should not be <br/>
listed on any web site (unless for some perverse reason the author wishes<br/>
it to remain (and there _are_ reasons for this, if you can believe it;<br/>
I did so with one of my boxes until I replaced it, because even though<br/>
it was missing, the clues were necessary (but we digress :-))<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2. Make a decision whether they want to pursue a particular box that<br/>
&gt; might be missing or hasn't been verified in a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I think this verification thing runs the risk of moving the logbook<br/>
out of the field and into the computer.  I think it could (unfairly)<br/>
stigmatize (or mystify) boxes that don't have cyberverification (for<br/>
whatever reasons).  It just doesn't sound as fun this way (although <br/>
I sense I'm in the minority in opinion here, amongst a bunch of <br/>
internet users :-))<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that I don't object to the _author_ doing this for their<br/>
own box; my argument pertains to opening it up to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I had someone e-mail me that my VF#2 box was missing.<br/>
I went out to the park the next day, and there it was.  What if this<br/>
person logged this to a database instead.  I'd never know, and there<br/>
is no way I would ever check.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I really think spinoff is overkill. <br/>
<br/>
Its not a matter of overkill, but the matter of different hobby for<br/>
different interests.  Like geocaching/letterboxing.  Not exactly<br/>
a spinoff, but I think serving different interests.  The same thing<br/>
could happen for letterboxing/treasureboxing.  For example, I don't<br/>
particularly care about stamp art.  To me, the clues and the hunt<br/>
are the crux of it.  Perhaps those who really want some degree of<br/>
confidence that the box they are looking for is there care to have<br/>
a stamp added to their book.  I'm not sure.  In any case, I see the<br/>
natural lines of a spinoff possible.  I don't think that is a bad<br/>
thing.  (And I think I'm in such a minority about how I feel about<br/>
these issues that such would not ever go anywhere ... I certainly<br/>
don't have the time and will to make it happen -- I'd just put my<br/>
stuff on a web site for all who found it, take it or leave it :-)).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I just think that status info would be helpful to those who care. <br/>
<br/>
I think it would too.  I think it would be harmful to those who don't<br/>
care :-) (If not handled properly, as I've said, the primary thing<br/>
being author control).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This is one of those times where a chatroom as I offered would be a<br/>
&gt; great way to discuss such things for those who care without boring<br/>
&gt; the others.<br/>
<br/>
I'll chat, but I don't feel like downloading another client when<br/>
e-groups, yahoo, and others already have chat set up.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

<br/>
I don't know much about databases, but I think it would be nice to <br/>
know what letterboxes are really out there.  It's kind of <br/>
disappointing to scurry around with the sole purpose of finding a <br/>
letterbox only to find out someone has pilfered it or the box is <br/>
incognito for whatever reason.  Whatever way you all feel is the best <br/>
way to handle it I'll go with the flow.  I'm not one for analysis <br/>
paralysis. Someone else who loves bureaucracy can deal with the fine <br/>
details.<br/>

<br/>
Let's face it: some clues are painfully straightforward. Other clues are<br/>
frustratingly cryptic. I don't need a "degree of difficulty clause"  to<br/>
tell me the clues are going to be a real bear. I can tell that just by<br/>
reading them. And yes, I can get easily frustrated, PARTICULARLY<br/>
depending on the time of the month. <br/>
<br/>
My point is...if someone writes lousy clues, I don't go after their silly<br/>
letterbox. I go to the site just for a beaultiful walk. If we start<br/>
thinking in terms of "standardization of clues",  and "rigid clauses", <br/>
we're gonna go down a slippery slope.<br/>
<br/>
Let us leave letterboxing (still in it's North American infancy) alone<br/>
and let it be the magical thing that it is. Sport for some, play for<br/>
others. <br/>
<br/>
In all out good intentions, we're starting to sound like a bunch of<br/>
lawyers.<br/>

<br/>
Myself, I don't exactly live in a region of the country[1] where<br/>
letterboxing is common (Minnesota has, at the moment, only a single<br/>
letterbox), and many of those aren't maintained.  My overall success<br/>
rate for letterboxing in this part of the country is exactly 50%--for<br/>
every letterbox I find, there's another that I went to find and it's<br/>
gone.  And it's not a matter of interpreting the clues and searching,<br/>
I *know* in the cases that I've found no box I'm dead on (for example,<br/>
the Pike Island, MN boxes have *trivial* clues and there really isn't<br/>
any way (minux a shovel) to hide boxes there---the boxes, and the<br/>
person that placed them, are long gone).  It gets frustrating, but not<br/>
all that bad because at least you still get to hunt around.<br/>
<br/>
Missing boxes are part of the fun, really.  But there are *many* boxes<br/>
out there that are truly MIA or dead, and if, say, 3 different people<br/>
aside from the author report a box as missing, we should treat it as<br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong, I'm *not* bitter.  In fact, today was 2 for 2 with<br/>
the Arizona[2] letterboxes (both we easy to find, but required a good<br/>
amount of beautiful hiking to do it).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[1] With the exception of Door Country , WI, which has a good number<br/>
of letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
[2] Obviously letterboxing isn't a big thing here, both spots had<br/>
relatively few stamps in them.<br/>
