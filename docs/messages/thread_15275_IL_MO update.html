                    <div class="plaintext-content">Despite the miserably hot weather we did manage to get to a few letterboxes on our ride to St. Louis.  We had planned to get to the St. Louis zoo and do those, too, but the 100 degree day just got the best of us and we had to say no.  Maybe next time!  Thanks to the Mohmers, however, who gave us updates on what was still available in the area. <br/>
<br/>
We did successfully find the "Happy Camper" in St. Charles and it's in great shape with many visitors.  We also found the "Fishers of Men" box (LOVED the *letter* box, btw) in Troy Township and it is also in great shape.  The Covered Bridge box in Mahomet/Champaign, IL, however seems to be missing.  The clues are pretty straight forward and we know we were in the right place.  But despite a careful search there doesn't seem to be any box left.  This box is unclaimed and there is no response emailing the placer directly from the address they posted with the clues.  However, it's a pretty place to visit and we enjoyed picnicing there!<br/>

Boy am i glad to be back home in Wisconsin and cooler temps !  :-)<br/>
