Please come and join us for a letterboxing gathering on Sept 26th from<br/>
10am-5pm at Rocky Neck State Park in Niantic, CT.  This gathering is<br/>
also a benefit for Malta, Inc.  Malta is a 501c3 that reaches out to the<br/>
homeless by providing socks, underwear, jeans, jackets, toiletries and<br/>
hot soup and sandwiches. Donations of the above will be collected.  All<br/>
who come will receive stamps depicting 16 different items as well as the<br/>
event stamp and the Malta stamp.  There is also a new series planted<br/>
entitled "The Twilight Series".  These stamps are amazing and were<br/>
carved by my daughter, a gifted artist.<br/>
<br/>
Fun and prizes for all.  We will have a drawing for tickets to the<br/>
Basketball Hall of Fame, and also a gift card to Flander Fish House.<br/>
Pot luck too, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Please come and enjoy the fun.  There is camping on site.  The park has<br/>
multiple trails and letterboxes and a beautiful beach as well.<br/>
