Do you mean you have a stamp you'd like to make into a box to send to events? <br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to send an event box to an upcoming event, either post to the list to let folks know it is up for grabs or, better yet, contact the host of the event and arrange to send it to them. Be sure to have plans for what they need to do with it after their event...do they send it back to you or directly on to the next the event?<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

The original thread for this was from Rustypuff; it seems that she <br/>
has a stamp to be included in the next gathering? In any case, the <br/>
PNW stamp is still here in Atlanta, along with many others, waiting <br/>
for the next gathering host or hostess to request them. Some of the <br/>
stamps were specifically sent for the Southeast Gathering and will be <br/>
heading back to their owners as requested.<br/>
