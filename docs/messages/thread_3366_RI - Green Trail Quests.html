                    <html><body><p>I just had some qualified good news.  I just spoke with Dave Monks of the Friends of the National Wildlife Refuge and Salt Pond Coalition.  He is the person currently responsible for the Green Trail Quests in Charlestown, RI.  He was surprised to hear that so many people were interested in letterboxing in the area and in finding the Green Trail Quest boxes.  He currently has the remaining boxes at his house for repair but was not sure when he would have a chance to replace them.  He also mentioned that he has three more to place.</p>
<p>I invited him to the upcoming Gathering at Burlingame.  He mentioned that he would try to come and would also invite the representative from the National Park Service in RI that he worked with in placing the original Green Trail Quest boxes.</p>
<p>I found Dave through a link on the Friends of the National Wildlife Refuge website that still has the clues for the Quest boxes.  When the boxes are replaced it should be a good link for those seeking them.</p>

We were also checking on the status of the Green Trail Quest boxes this <br/>
weekend.  It seems only 2 of the 6 are presently do-able as is:  <br/>
Charlestown Chamber of Commerce and Trustom Pond.  Cross Mills Library <br/>
is complete except there is no longer a stamp in the box.  Polly's Rock <br/>
and Frosty Drew Nature Center have gone missing as has Charlestown <br/>
Beach Merchants but the lady at the gallery there also gave us Dave's <br/>
number as the contact person.<br/>
<br/>
We were about to call him to see if he wanted to replace the stamp at <br/>
Cross Mills but hopefully Trish has now taken care of that.  Even <br/>
without these missing boxes there should still be plenty in the area <br/>
but it would be nice to get them fixed.<br/>
