As someone who gets the rash easily, I can say that I've found a 'cure' <br/>
in the form of those bottles of hand sanitizer sold in grocery stores.  <br/>
After contact, I rub the sanitizer every where I think may have been in <br/>
contact with the oil of the plant.<br/>
<br/>
No rash to date and it also stops the irritation itches you pick up out <br/>
on the trail.  I picked up a brand that was a $1.00 for a pump top <br/>
bottle.<br/>

     Oh yeh.<br/>
<br/>
 First official trip of the summer to go letterboxing in glorious New<br/>
 England.<br/>
<br/>
 Found the first box.<br/>
<br/>
 Had a bit of trouble finding the second box. But did find a little<br/>
 toad who hopped off the path. My 6 year old said, "hey a toad. I<br/>
 think it went in here in the plants."<br/>
<br/>
 OH MMMAN!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 So I said, "Just slowly step away from the three-leaved plant<br/>
 climbing the tree. I will Technu you when we get to the car just<br/>
 don't . . . scratch your face. . ."<br/>
<br/>
 OH MMMMMAN!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
 "Don't touch anywhere else, just put your hands to your . . . STOP<br/>
 SCRATCHING YOUR FACE!!! No, I don't want to hold your hand at this<br/>
 moment. Ahhh, get away from me!!!! RUN AWAY!!!!!"<br/>
<br/>
 First day out. Poison ivy. On the face and neck, of course it doesn't<br/>
 appear for a day after the event. He wakes up in the morning and his<br/>
 eye is all puffy and little red blisters start appearing on his<br/>
 cheeks. My brother says my wife is going to fire me from the Stay-at-<br/>
 home-dad thing. He suggests I should look into severance pay.<br/>

The alcohol in those hand sanitizers will indeed remove the urushiol <br/>
oil from your skin. But then you have to be extra careful that you <br/>
don't expose that part of your skin to poison ivy again, since the <br/>
alcohol will have removed the natural oils from your skin and make <br/>
you even more susceptible to the urushiol -- allowing it to penetrate <br/>
your skin twice as quickly!<br/>

a preventative for poison ivy. He says that starting in the early <br/>
spring, as the first leaves begin to appear on the plant, eat 2 leaves <br/>
a day. As the plants mature you'll have developed an immunity to it <br/>
for that season. Since I don't relish the idea of experiencing poison <br/>
ivy in my throat, I havn't brought myself around to trying it.<br/>
