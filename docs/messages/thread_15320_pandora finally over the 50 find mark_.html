<br/>
Okay so usually I don't sign the bottom of my posts with a <br/>
F/P/E/X/blah blah blah count because I really feel that some people <br/>
get a bit competative about that and so I just figure no big deal no <br/>
reason for me to do it.  But I got so excited these weekend after <br/>
hitting my 54th find that it just made me do a little happy dance and <br/>
I decided to share it with the list.  <br/>
<br/>
We had a great weekend letterboxing - Team Chaos which now consists <br/>
of Iron`Bear, myself and Sim Kitty.  Boy do I gotta tell you, we <br/>
startet out for the Multnomah Falls series and set out rather late on <br/>
Saturday so after a little over a 2 mile hike all up hill we nabbed <br/>
two boxes and then turned around and went back.  Yesterday however we <br/>
started over, passed the two boxes we had already nabbed and then <br/>
snatched 2 more.  By the time we had finished we had completed <br/>
roughly a 6 mile hike at a 3200 Ft. Elevation gain.  Wow not only was <br/>
I proud of myself, but Sim Kitty was a real real trooper, walked the <br/>
whole thing herself, didn't complain until we were on the last leg of <br/>
the hike and all and all just did really really well with the whole <br/>
thing!<br/>
<br/>
Iron`Bear and I just love the Multnomah Falls area. He has lived here <br/>
most his life and done a ton of hiking and it is one area we have <br/>
found so far that he has never explored.  It has been fun to explore <br/>
it together.<br/>
<br/>
So we ended up getting 3 of the Der Mad Stamper (And the Ryan <br/>
Replacements) for this area, and then we Managed to nab Fun Hog's <br/>
Octopus.  <br/>
<br/>
We will be hitting the area again looking for some more soon!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all have a blast boxing!<br/>
