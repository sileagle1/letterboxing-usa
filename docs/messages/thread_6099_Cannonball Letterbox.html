<br/>Mary and I checked on our Cannonball and AFW's MacEvoy Trail boxes yesterday..... Since you reported than Castle Point was in good shape, we didn't bother checking it........ Both were there and in good shape.  However, we placed all our boxes in late fall, winter or early spring when grasses and leaves were nonexistent. Poison ivy, was much less of a problem then, too.  Locating them is definitely harder, but not impossible, with the foliage hiding 'wired trees' and the like.  Sorry.

problem on Saturday!!!  We had  a great time and loved the Foxcroft <br/>
Mansion!!<br/>
