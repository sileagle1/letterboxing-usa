&gt; Save yourself dear, and stop while you're ahead.<br/>
&gt; It all seemed to be going so well, until.......<br/>
<br/>
There are more people and more letterboxes on the east coast, therefore <br/>
there are more in each strata of each individual's putative "quality" <br/>
curve.  That is not my opinion, but a natural fact.  Lets leave it at <br/>
that ... as Hang Glider suggested, please consider waiting 24 hours <br/>
before deciding if you need to jump into this pool ...<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a couple of cool (I think, anyway) letterboxing stories <br/>
instead --<br/>
<br/>
So, I planning this new box, and one of the landmarks in the clue is<br/>
a covered bridge in the middle of nowhere.  So I go out there to get<br/>
some information, and much to my surprise, a folk festival has broken<br/>
out at the covered bridge!  It is the most unlikely thing I've ever <br/>
seen, certainly in a most unlikely place.  Small, low key, and really <br/>
cool, with really talented musicians.  Literally people wearing sun <br/>
dresses with flowers in their hair being nice to each other.  I'm more<br/>
likely to be spotted in a mosh pit than at such an affair, but the <br/>
serendipity of the whole thing was just really cool.  I stayed for<br/>
five hours, and it all happened because of the coolness of <br/>
letterboxing ...<br/>
<br/>
The other story is in the has-this-ever-happened-to-you class.  I tend<br/>
to place my boxes, and then spend a long time writing the clues, so the<br/>
boxes tend to be out there clueless, as it were.  I find places with <br/>
zero chance of accidental discovery, I mean remote places way off trail<br/>
that no one is going to randomly wander thru, and well-hidden -- this <br/>
model seems to have worked pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I get an e-mail from someone who says they found one of my <br/>
boxes, but their description of the hunt doesn't make any sense.  It <br/>
then hits me they may have found a box for which the clues haven't <br/>
even been written!  My boxes are hard enough to find _with_ the clues :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think about moving it, but its really in the place I want for<br/>
the clue to work, so I decide to leave it where it is.  In fact, I feel<br/>
its pretty improbable that this accidental discovery happened, and that<br/>
the hunter is confusing two different boxes in her narrative to me.  <br/>
But I decide to check anyway, and much to my surprise, _two_ people have<br/>
stamped in!  Unbelievable!<br/>
<br/>
So, I moved it well out of there, and reworked the clues ...<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if these true stories are interesting to anyone but me, but <br/>
I think the list prefers stories to flames in general.  Something to <br/>
consider before hitting the send button, FWIW ...<br/>

<br/>
I too think that every box I've found and placed is lovely.  I appreciate the hike, the effort on clues, the money spent on supplies and most of all the time it gives me with my family...be it east coast, west coast, Seattle or abroad.<br/>

<div>I have a question regarding this post.  And no,  I

<div>I have been under the impression that we should be hiding our 
boxes in a way that does not require disturbing the area in order to retrieve 
the box.  (Leave no trace)  In my mind that has meant <u>not 
</u>placing anything really "off trail".  I have the good fortune to live 
surrounded by Acadia National Park and know the havoc that is done to this area 
by all the visitors who would rather make their own trail.  So,  my 
question is this:  What are people's "rules of thumb" regarding where you 
plant?  How far "off trail" do you tend to go?  So far my plants have 
been where the searchers will be walking on shoreline or climbing on ledge - so 
nothing to trample.  I would really like to hear others thoughts on 
this.  Thanks for your time.</div>

We should be.  Most of my boxes (including the one in question, most likely),<br/>
average less than 5 visitors a year (in reality, less than 2, but if I make<br/>
that claim, someone will flame me if they saw 3 stamps in one of the ones in <br/>
question because they missed the words "most" and "average", sigh ...).  <br/>
<br/>
That is far less than other off-trail activity in the areas, from sports such <br/>
as hunting, fishing, geocaching, adventure racing, and orienteering, all of <br/>
which are at higher volumes, some of which also leave no trace at these higher <br/>
volumes, and all of which are socially accepted in the areas in question.<br/>

I'm confident that I'm a very ethical placer and respect the woods.  Anyone is<br/>
free to remove any of my boxes that they feel violate these ethics.<br/>

<br/>
Your question did not offend me in any way, and I realised that after I<br/>
replied it could give the impression that it did :-)  I was pretty steamed<br/>
about the other response to my "flames and stories" post, and let that seep<br/>
thru.  Sorry for the confusion :-)<br/>
<br/>
I pretty much would have said the same thing tho, my strategy for respecting<br/>
LNT ethics is to keep the visitor count very low -- I've never seen a social<br/>
trail develop to any of my boxes (I have heard of people tearing up areas<br/>
looking for them, but that is on them).  My boxes do not require any impact <br/>
to the area to be found.  (If you have to turn over a rock, the rock remains <br/>
the same weight after being turned over, therefore it can be put back,<br/>
whether you find the box or not). <br/>
<br/>
