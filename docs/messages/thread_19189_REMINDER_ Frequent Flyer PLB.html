Oh Oh Oh!  The Thoops gave me a GREAT idea for a box!!!  I am going to<br/>
do a "frequent Flyer" box.  This box will weigh UNDER 1 pound ($3.85 for<br/>
shipping) and will travel coast to coast with the longest distance<br/>
traveled between each stop.<br/>
<br/>
So... if you are up for this one - send me an email!  Let's see how many<br/>
miles this stamp can rack up!  I will add everyone who responds to me<br/>
BEFORE June 30, 11:59pm MST.  This gives me PLENTY of time to plan for<br/>
it since I have two boxes to send out before I can even start on this<br/>
one.  This box will go out mid-late July.<br/>
<br/>
One REQUIREMENT (if you want to call it that).  I need your promise that<br/>
you will mail this box out within 48 hours of receiving it.  The list is<br/>
going to be long and I don't want those at the end to have to wait<br/>
forever. =]<br/>
<br/>
Email me privately with your address (please include your trail name if<br/>
you have it) to: dscott5377 @ earthlink.net<br/>
<br/>
I hve got to be crazy!  =]<br/>
<br/>
PS - PLEASE leave this as the title of your email... I have them<br/>
directed to a special inbox so I can keep track of everyone.<br/>
