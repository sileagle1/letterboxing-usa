                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent the better part of today tramping around in<br/>
the rain-soaked woods of Cherokee County - found 4<br/>
boxes and had a wonderful time.  It's been ages since<br/>
all four of us could get out somewhere together - my<br/>
husband, our 15 yo daughter, our 7 yo son, and me - so<br/>
it was just what we all needed!  My kids and I have<br/>
been interested in letterboxing for awhile, but my<br/>
husband was a reluctant recruit (although I can't<br/>
imagine why - it has all the elements of what he<br/>
considers a good time to be!).  By the end of the day,<br/>
he was full of great ideas for new hiding spots and<br/>
clues to go with them.  I'm a little worried about all<br/>
our erasers coming up missing from our homeschool and<br/>
all my butter tubs being appropriated from the<br/>
kitchen!  I promise, no butter tubs in the woods, but<br/>
I do feel a glut of boxes coming on in East Texas!<br/>
<br/>
Silver Eagle and BabyBear have been busy planting<br/>
boxes in our area.  We found Silver Eagle's Spanish<br/>
Flag and BabyBear's Tejas at Mission Tejas - both dry<br/>
and in perfect condition.  We were the first stamps in<br/>
both of these, besides the two of them.  Mission Tejas<br/>
is always beautiful, no matter what time of year you<br/>
go!  We did have a close encounter with a coral snake<br/>
on our way to one of the boxes - okay, it wasn't<br/>
CLOSE, but we did see one, following the trail in<br/>
front of us!  We stepped a little light through the<br/>
area where we saw it disappear, worried that we would<br/>
find it again at the box, but apparently it wasn't a<br/>
letterboxer - but we should've known that anyway - it<br/>
didn't have inky fingers!<br/>
<br/>
We went on to the Caddoan Indian Mounds and found<br/>
BabyBear's Stone Celt box.  Before heading for the<br/>
box, we toured the visitor center and walked the trail<br/>
around.  The Mounds are technically a State Historic<br/>
Site, not a Park.  The curators there are excellent<br/>
and there always seems to be some sort of <br/>
archaeological project going on somewhere on the<br/>
grounds.  I learn something new about the Caddo<br/>
Indians every time I go there!  As a bonus today,<br/>
there was a small class of students from Rusk who were<br/>
touring the Mounds.  While my husband and son ventured<br/>
to the top of one of the mounds, I talked to the<br/>
teacher.  The students had signed up for a project to<br/>
learn in depth about Indians, learning their ways and<br/>
methods, as well as their history and customs.  He<br/>
told me about a lady in Jacksonville (hey! That's<br/>
where WE live!) who is the<br/>
great-great-great-great-granddaughter (give or take a<br/>
great) of Quanah Parker.  As I told him about my son's<br/>
interest in Indians and our attempt to begin studying<br/>
Native American culture in our home school last year,<br/>
he called her and got permission to give me her name<br/>
and phone number so we can go visit her - WOW! <br/>
Something interesting always happens to us at the<br/>
Mounds!  We let the class slip past us before we moved<br/>
on toward the box, stopping for a snack of water and<br/>
homemade bread (my daughter called it prison rations).<br/>
 As we walked, we could almost visualize the Indian<br/>
village that encompassed the area almost 1000 years<br/>
ago.  We found the box in great condition and stamped<br/>
in, once again the first stamps besides Silver Eagle<br/>
and Baby Bear.<br/>
<br/>
We headed back toward home, stopping in Rusk at Hogg<br/>
State Historic Site to eat another snack and find<br/>
another of Baby Bear's boxes - Hogg, named after James<br/>
Hogg, the first governor of Texas born in the state. <br/>
My son loved that stamp!  Before we hit the trail to<br/>
find the box, we ate another snack of prison rations<br/>
and as we were eating, an absolutely huge tree fell in<br/>
the woods, right before our very eyes!  We laughingly<br/>
hoped it hadn't fallen ON the box, given the recent<br/>
discussion about boxes being destroyed by natural<br/>
events.  We hit the trail and were relieved to<br/>
discover that the box was safe from falling timber and<br/>
drenching rains - and hidden beautifully, as they all<br/>
had been.  Once again, we were the first to stamp in. <br/>
We were just buttoning everything up again when we had<br/>
two groups approaching - one from each side!  We broke<br/>
out the bread again and had ANOTHER snack, although we<br/>
were less enthusiastic about this one (hope no one<br/>
finds moldy bread crumbs left behind in the box). <br/>
They all passed us by, thinking the telltale<br/>
tupperware container was nothing more than our snack. <br/>
We decided to go ahead and take the nature trail on<br/>
around, and as we reached the innermost part of the<br/>
trail, we ran up behind one of the groups who had<br/>
passed by us.  As we all met on the trail (and our one<br/>
boy and their three had to do the human form of<br/>
sniff-and-greet), one of the boys in their group<br/>
suddenly shouted that he saw a deer.  We all turned<br/>
around and not ten feet behind us was a young buck,<br/>
almost finished losing his spots with down still on<br/>
his antlers.  The kids all scrambled for food to feed<br/>
it (my son grabbed the bread from the backpack - of<br/>
course!).  Before I could caution them about not<br/>
approaching him so that he wouldn't be too familiar<br/>
with humans as hunting season gets closer, the deer<br/>
walked right up to us!  He started rubbing his antlers<br/>
against my daughter's hand and wouldn't have any part<br/>
of quitting until she had thoroughly scratched his<br/>
head.  All the boys got to pet him and get a good<br/>
close look at him, then the other group moved on.  The<br/>
buck was still trying to get his head scratched, so we<br/>
stayed a moment or two longer.  My daughter, ever the<br/>
animal lover, wanted to take him home with us.  We<br/>
told her that if he followed us to the car, we would<br/>
take him.  Finally, we headed out ourselves, only to<br/>
turn around and find him trotting along behind us,<br/>
having fallen in just like he was a part of the party.<br/>
 I was starting to worry we would have to make good on<br/>
our word - when will I learn not to make foolish<br/>
promises?  We finally lost him at a creek.  Still<br/>
concerned about him being overly familiar with humans,<br/>
I mentioned to the park ranger that we had run into an<br/>
awfully friendly deer - he told us the deer's name is<br/>
Bambino and he thinks he's a dog.  He assured me that<br/>
Bambino is not likely to leave the park area, and that<br/>
if he does, he'll have to cross quite a bit of<br/>
concrete before he can get to a hunting ground.  As I<br/>
thought about it, I realized that is probably true,<br/>
but even so.  What a shame it would be if he actually<br/>
DID leave and he actually DID cross all that<br/>
civilization.  Hmmmm.<br/>
<br/>
It started to rain, so rather than go for the last box<br/>
we wanted to find, we headed toward home.  We figured<br/>
we'll get that one when we return to plant a couple of<br/>
our own.<br/>
<br/>
Now I know I've been a little long-winded, but I<br/>
wanted to give anyone in shouting distance of East<br/>
Texas the idea of what they are missing by not<br/>
visiting the boxes Silver Eagle and Baby Bear have<br/>
planted up here.  They really are worth the drive, for<br/>
the boxes and the scenery and the learning<br/>
opportunities!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">BarefootLucy, Thanks for posting about your family's letterboxing <br/>
adventure! And what a great day it was! I love historical sites and <br/>
reading about the places you went, made me stop midway through your <br/>
post and do a search for Mission Tejas and then the Caddoan Indian <br/>
Mounds. Both were fascinating! I would love to visit there some day. <br/>
I used to be quite into archeology, although my 'dig' days are over, <br/>
now. I am still keenly interested, but no more spending hour after <br/>
hour getting all dirty in the hot sun for me. <br/>
<br/>
What a learning resource treasure you found, thanks to the teacher <br/>
you encountered - and right in your hometown too!<br/>
<br/>
That is wonderful about your husband joining you and the children, <br/>
and ending up getting the letterboxing 'bug' too!<br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh about your 'prison rations'... and that huge tree <br/>
falling right before your eyes! <br/>
<br/>
Our day had quite a few similarities as far as letterboxing goes. I <br/>
also searched for and found another of Silver Eagle's letterboxes <br/>
this afternoon, which I will post about later. We had rain off and <br/>
on here all day too... remnants of Tropical Storm Grace. And we saw <br/>
a snake too, but luckily 'ours' was just a harmless ribbon snake. <br/>
AND, I think I 'created' a new letterboxer - my 23 year old son, who <br/>
accompanied me today. :) <br/>
