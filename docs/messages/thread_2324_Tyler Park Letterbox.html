Clues:<br/>
Take the Covered Bridge Trail down the hill to where it bends first to<br/>
the right then to the left spying the covered bridge through the trees.<br/>
Stop here for a brief history lesson about the rebuilding of the<br/>
bridge.  When you are finished turn around and proceed through the<br/>
bridgecareful not to step in horse droppings.  With 3 trails to pick<br/>
from take the one that keeps you out in the open.  Pass by a sign to the<br/>
right that welcomes you.  Continue uphill.  Eventually you will cross<br/>
over a driven road and pick up the trail on the other side.  Soon you<br/>
will reach a T in the trail, proceed on the one that reads 306*.  This<br/>
path will lead you down under the trees.  Youll know youre on the<br/>
right track if you spot a Safety Zone.  At the 2nd Safety Zone turn<br/>
your compass to 320* and let it point the way.  The lush canopy hugging<br/>
the trail will guide your way.  Follow the trail down through the canyon<br/>
and back up the other side.  This section will follow along the<br/>
Neshaminy Creek.  Pass by the limbo tree down and to the left of you.<br/>
You should now be getting closer to the water.  After descending the<br/>
hill stay on a heading of 24*.  The trail will take a sharp turn to the<br/>
right straighten out then turn right again bringing you closer to the<br/>
creeks edge.  Spy the tree that has a belly button.  Continue on until<br/>
you come to a V.  Standing at the point of the V turn back to the<br/>
direction from where you just came.  Look up to find the tall twin<br/>
trees.  Standing to the right of those trees what you seek is in the<br/>
tree at 225*.  After you stamped up you can return to the trail and<br/>
continue on a short distance to complete the loop hike.  This will bring<br/>
you back to the Covered Bridge.<br/>
