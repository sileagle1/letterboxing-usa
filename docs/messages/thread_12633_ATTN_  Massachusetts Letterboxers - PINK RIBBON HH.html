                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon created a Special Charity Hitchhiker called the "Pink<br/>
Ribbon" in memory of those we have lost to Breast Cancer. Our concept <br/>
is that for each time the "Pink Ribbon" is found, TeamGreenDragon <br/>
will donate money to the American Breast Cancer Foundation for <br/>
research.  We would like for the "Pink Ribbon" to be a " public " <br/>
hitchhiker, meaning that when it is found that the finder would post <br/>
to the Yahoo talklist where they found it and where they placed it, <br/>
in the hopes that anyone who may be interested in moving it along <br/>
will know where to look for it. The quicker this Hitchhiker gets <br/>
moved, the quicker breast cancer awareness will become more common <br/>
and more money will be donated to help research.  (We are not asking <br/>
for money - we, TeamGreenDragon - will donate $ but of course,  <br/>
anybody who wishes to, can also donate $)<br/>
<br/>
The last we have heard - The "Pink Ribbon" was dropped off at <br/>
the "Turkey<br/>
Trot" letterbox in Harvard, Ma.<br/>
by Seekyr, Blaze and Mobius on 1/19/03.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great letterbox. The clues are fun as it tells the story <br/>
from the turkey's point of view. We found this box on a cold, snowy <br/>
day over the winter, and even then, we enjoyed the location and as it <br/>
was our last box of the day, a very nice stroll in the woods. Also <br/>
the stamp is just too cute for words. All in all you'll be rooting <br/>
for the turkey.<br/>
<br/>
So, We are hoping that someone will see this post and find this <br/>
creatively done letterbox placed by Seekyr and give the "Pink Ribbon" <br/>
a ride somewhere new.<br/>
<br/>
(If someone else has already moved the "Pink Ribbon" from the Turkey <br/>
Trot - we would be grateful if you would post to the Yahoo talk list <br/>
where you left it.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Everyone!!!<br/>
TeamGreenDragon :)<br/>
