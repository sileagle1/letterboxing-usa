beautiful park.  She was just beside herself with joy on finding the <br/>
box.  Tomorrow we hope to find 2.  The Turtle (my 12 yr. old) says <br/>
the stamp is real cool. We can't wait to see your others now that you <br/>
are into creating stamps.  Pretend you see us dancing!!!!!<br/>

I'm so glad you found it!  I walk Centennial several times a week, so I try to check the box too.  I was there today, but it was SOOOO crowded this morning, I chose to keep walking.  I just love to see that people have been there!<br/>
<br/>
If time permits, I'm thinking of heading back to Patapsco State park tomorrow to plant another there.  I've already carved the stamp (for as I've mentioned before - I'm completely obsessed!) so I just need to put the box together.<br/>
<br/>
Look for clues soon!<br/>
