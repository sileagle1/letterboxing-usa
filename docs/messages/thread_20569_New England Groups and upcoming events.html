<br/>
I'm relatively new to this hobby. On the website, I noticed in the <br/>
memories section that there was a convention in New England for a <br/>
couple of years. Are those still being held? Are there user groups <br/>
that meet on a regular basis in this [art of the country and where <br/>
would I look to get information on those events? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Muggy    <br/>
