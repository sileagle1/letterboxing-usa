Being dial-up luddites, until this morning we haven't been able to view Rae <br/>
Dell Record's video of the first letterbox gathering that was held in VT back <br/>
in 1999. If you're in the same boat, we highly recommend you take the time to <br/>
see it. The video is very nicely produced by Rae and includes scenes of early <br/>
American letterboxers flushed with the delightful enthusiasm of creating a new <br/>
pastime. There are shots of the Mapsurfer, LoneWolf, Orient Express, VT Viking <br/>
and Susan Davis, Martian Maggot and others. You can really see them in the <br/>
act of developing the habits we all enjoy so much; clue writing, running around <br/>
looking with puzzled expressions, discovering a find, stamping in. The video <br/>
is charming and we send special thanks to Rae for producing it and to Mark &amp; <br/>
Sue for hosting it. Check it out at<br/>
