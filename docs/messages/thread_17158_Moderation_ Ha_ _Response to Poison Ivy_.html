<br/>
Since I am the first to address your concerns let me say that I do <br/>
understand many of the points you make and that they have validity.  <br/>
However I think that you are misunderstanding a few things on the <br/>
moderator's end of things.<br/>
<br/>
First of all I am not sure where you got the impression that <br/>
moderators were added due to the recent events on the list.  There <br/>
have not been any moderators added since me and that was almost two <br/>
months ago I believe.  We are not strengthening the forces so to <br/>
speak, we are just sending the ones we have out on calls and out on <br/>
the beat more often. <br/>
<br/>
And your right Poison Ivy, you were probably not the only one that <br/>
the events on the list did not bother.  And not to sound callous but <br/>
frankly, it doesn't matter that it didn't bother you. It bothered <br/>
enough people that we feel a need to do something about it.  If it <br/>
didn't bother you that people were constantly arguing, slapping each <br/>
other around and being uncivil, then it should not bother you that we <br/>
are doing something to stop it.  Unless of course that sort of <br/>
behavior amuses you in which case I can see what that the moderation <br/>
of such would bother you, but I highly doubt that is the case.<br/>
<br/>
Your analogy of putting the whole class under guard because jonny was <br/>
acting out doesn't work here, it was not just jonny, it was not one <br/>
person that could be singled out and spoken too and it was an ongoing <br/>
problem.  The rest of the class is not being "punished" per say, they <br/>
are just being made aware that the rules around her are getting a bit <br/>
more structured and that we will not put up with the sort of behavior <br/>
that was being exhibited anymore.<br/>
<br/>
You're absolutely right; being moderated should have no effect on <br/>
you.  For two reasons #1 You will only ever be moderated if you do <br/>
or say something that constitutes personal attacks, flaming or <br/>
beating a publicly announced dead horse.  And #2 Because the reality <br/>
is that your posts, your responses, your words on this list, have <br/>
always been "moderated" so to speak just in the fact alone that the <br/>
Owners and the moderators have the ability to delete anything you <br/>
post.  <br/>
<br/>
As to your points about inconsistency in moderation, you are speaking <br/>
about moderation during our Laissez Faire attitudes about it and I am <br/>
sure you will see more consistency in our actions now that we are <br/>
doing so with a heavier hand and a zero tolerance for the personal <br/>
attacks and flames.  <br/>
<br/>
And for the record Poison Ivy, we tried the Laissez Faire moderation <br/>
and attitudes and it did not work  this is not about offending <br/>
someone, it is about interrupting a group of people gathered together <br/>
to enjoy this hobby with callous and instigative remarks and that <br/>
cause disarray in that group of people. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this answers some of your questions and address some of your <br/>
issues.<br/>
Your concerns are valid and noted among the moderators I assure you.<br/>
I hate to sound like a parent but it all comes down to this don't do <br/>
something to get yourself in trouble and you won't get in trouble. <br/>
Don't try to steal cookies out of the cookie jar and you won't get <br/>
caught with your hand in it.  And when one of your friends do, learn <br/>
by example, don't get involved.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you well,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Perhaps I'm a different sort of person, but, shouldn't things of this nature<br/>
be addressed, by a moderator, off list?  I've always been taught that you<br/>
praise in public and chastise in private.  That way, these kinds of off<br/>
topics posts (What constitutes off topic by the way?) do not perpetuate into<br/>
infinity, but, are handled, discussed, whatever, in a more private setting?<br/>
Or, do we in fact need to see the 'discussion' or 'punishment' each time<br/>
someone steps out of line?  Want to know the best way to douse a fire? Don't<br/>
feed it any more fuel.<br/>
