Thanks for the congrats, folks - I'm just glad I've been able to get out <br/>
letterboxing at all this summer!  Soon after I got back from Texas this spring, I <br/>
started having one fibromyalgia flare-up after another, including some of the <br/>
worst ones I've ever had!  I'd had such a good time driving out to Texas and <br/>
back, that I'd hoped to do another road trip this summer out to Montana/Idaho <br/>
for CDT trail work and to hit the rest of the states that I hadn't yet gotten to for <br/>
letterboxing (although I'd already been to all 50 states years ago for hiking!)  <br/>
Well, I had to cancel those plans, give up my hopes to seed that long lonely <br/>
stretch of eastern North Dakota that has no boxes, and get myself into a <br/>
fibromyalgia research study that is keeping me closer to home nowadays, at <br/>
least for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, there is still no lack of new boxes that keep popping out in CT <br/>
and MA to keep me busy on the days that I feel better or have to go up to MA <br/>
for the study tests.  Each time I've gone up, I've managed to collect a bunch of <br/>
new stamps so I've finally gotten both my RI and MA box counts up to over <br/>
500, and CT is fast approaching 3500!  Recently a whole batch of new boxes <br/>
came out in Maine, too, so I thought I'd shoot for reaching 500 up there as <br/>
well.  Wouldn't you know, the day I headed up the temperature reached a very <br/>
humid 98 degrees and I could barely breathe!  Then a heavy rainstorm came <br/>
through bringing down wires and trees and trapping me temporarily in the <br/>
backcountry, but I still got all the boxes that I went up there for:  MAC's "Rest in <br/>
Peace" series of cemetery symbols through the ages, Erin's "Worldwide <br/>
Maine" series of boxes spread out in owns with international names, and <br/>
even a few extra ones like Paplela's "Rail and Trail" along the AT, which <br/>
became my F8000!  And, since my time there was so limited, I didn't even <br/>
have to go Down East of go fishing along the coast to make my "Maine quota", <br/>
but stuck to the same general area where I had reached my F5000 almost <br/>
exactly one year before!  I was delighted to find out that the boxes I'd planted <br/>
there on my way down from Tumbledown Mt. (my F5000 July 23, 2004) had <br/>
recently been visited, too!<br/>
<br/>
This time on my way home, I decided to pass through NH, and plant a couple <br/>
of boxes with stamps carved by RTRW for specific destinations,  Pete will be <br/>
posting those clues as soon as he gets a chance.  Then, since I was so close, <br/>
I figured I might as well swing up to Milan for the "Flower Fairy" and was <br/>
rewarded by young Blake and his family with a lovely ivy plant that is now <br/>
hanging in my kitchen!  A few additional pleasant hikes in the Whites left me <br/>
just enough time to get down to the Lowell Folk Festival for a fun-filled <br/>
weekend of music and dance with my friends in MA.  (Pete didn't feel like <br/>
driving up, but he did catch part of the program being broadcast live on NPR!)  <br/>
And now it's home for a "breather" until I feel well enough to plan our next <br/>
adventure!  Thanks for keeping those boxes coming  we'll try to get to as <br/>
many as we can!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
