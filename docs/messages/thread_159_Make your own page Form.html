I think we have consent and support to create a clues form.<br/>
But I would like to pose a few questions:<br/>
<br/>
How do all ya'll want this thing to work? -- Esp. all ya'll in the BIG T land?<br/>
Really, I hope this will take some of the sting out of your lost boxes in TEXAS<br/>
--Julie &amp; Shannon, &amp;Sheila &amp; Sylvia -- also Deborah &amp; Randy.<br/>
<br/>
This could be anything from a real bland, black and white input form:<br/>
a "Type your name and your clues here." sort of thing<br/>
to a form that would allow you to place your own marker on the map, name it,<br/>
and then design the form that you get when you click on the marker.<br/>
<br/>
[For those of you who don't know how the map sequencing is used to get clues<br/>
look at http://www.letterboxing.org/ and click on a dark gray state, then on<br/>
a purple dot.]<br/>
<br/>
As its gone in the past when seeking input from the group sometimes only 5<br/>
or 6 people will respond.  Those 5 or 6 (if that's all there is) will be<br/>
deciding for all of you.  I think this is one of those things that once we<br/>
do it it will not be easy to change.  It may predicate how the clues data<br/>
is put in place.  So make your preferences known now.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when the pumpkin colored background gave sway to teal blue, (which<br/>
is what we have now), there was an overwhelming majority in favor of it.  I<br/>
hope it goes as well for this.  My personal preference is to have a form that<br/>
allows you to choose color, fonts and layout, as well as to allow you to put<br/>
your own marker on the map.  If I did it my way I would put a "Default"<br/>
choice on the form that would simply create the page with the standard<br/>
colors, fonts, etc.  That would give you the best of both worlds.  You'd<br/>
have the "simple default form" option or the "create a detailed form" option.<br/>
<br/>
You may have other ideas about how to do this or you may disagree with one or<br/>
both of the two options mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
I'm posing this to you now so that everyone can have input.  Don't be shy.<br/>
Make your prefernces known.  As far as possible I'll do all the work on this,<br/>
but I need creative input.<br/>
<br/>
At this point I may be just gathering information on how this thing is going<br/>
to work (once we get around to implementing it), but its important to know<br/>
in advance how its going to work because that may determine some other <br/>
phases that are technical and which you could care less about.  Did that<br/>
make any sense?  If not, just trust me.  Its important to know how you want<br/>
this to look far in advance of implementing it.  That's why I'm seeking input<br/>
now though it may not be implemented for a year or more.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you much for your input,<br/>
Dan'l<br/>

<br/>
Here's some input, though I feel like I know so little about it that I"m<br/>
barely qualified to vote.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;How do all ya'll want this thing to work?<br/>
I want this think to work really really EASY.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;This could be anything from a real bland, black and white input form:<br/>
&gt;a "Type your name and your clues here." sort of thing<br/>
B&amp;W bland form to fill out sounds just fine to me as long as it looks<br/>
FABulous when it's done and online.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;to a form that would allow you to place your own marker on the map, name it,<br/>
&gt;and then design the form that you get when you click on the marker.<br/>
I think it might be easier to follow for people interested in letterboxing<br/>
if the form was pre-designed and consistant--although any consistency might<br/>
be lost when all of us INDIVIDUALS input clues...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My personal preference is to have a form that<br/>
&gt;allows you to choose color, fonts and layout, as well as to allow you to put<br/>
&gt;your own marker on the map.  If I did it my way I would put a "Default"<br/>
&gt;choice on the form that would simply create the page with the standard<br/>
&gt;colors, fonts, etc.  That would give you the best of both worlds.  You'd<br/>
&gt;have the "simple default form" option or the "create a detailed form" option.<br/>
Sounds good to me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the time you put into this!<br/>

In dog years...I'm dead!<br/>
Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>
