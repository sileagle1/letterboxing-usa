webmasters and got it reversed.  Unfortunately, the Klez virus is <br/>
going around this talk list.  Klez pulls a random email address out <br/>
of the infected user's contact list and sends out spam email with <br/>
the chosen address as the return, so spam emails appear to be coming <br/>
from you that are not actually sent by you.  Perhaps this is what <br/>
happened to you as well.  In my case, a message entitled "Japenese <br/>
lasses sexy pics" got sent to the talk list with my return address, <br/>
which got me promptly banned from the list.  I posted a message to <br/>
the talk list back at the end of July (#30832) imploring people to <br/>
scan their machines and providing a link to a free online scanner.  <br/>
If infected, people can go to the Norton anti-virus web site to <br/>
download free cleaning tools that eliminate Klez, and there's also a <br/>
tool there now for the latest SoBig worm.  Please people, scan and <br/>
clean your computers!!!<br/>

there was a person or two who were "shunned," but the new website is <br/>
open to all who would care to use it. Could you and Nancy please let <br/>
me know what trouble you're having with signing in? I checked both <br/>
your accounts and they seem just fine. Quite an impressive list <br/>
of 'boxes on both, by the way.<br/>

up, <br/>
