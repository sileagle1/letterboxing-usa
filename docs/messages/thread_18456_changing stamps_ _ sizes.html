Then I carved a new simple one, quickly, when I needed a stamp and <br/>
didn't have one.  Used that one for several months before I carved a <br/>
better one.  Now I plan to carve an even better one.  (Um, soon.)<br/>
<br/>
I do happen to have some consitency though.  The first commercial <br/>
stamp that I used for my personal stamp was of The Doubtful Guest.  <br/>
That is still used as a symbol for our group.  The 2nd and 3rd <br/>
stamps are all scarabs.  The 4th will be too.<br/>
<br/>
Use what works for you. <br/>

Besides, when you get/make a new personal stamp people want to <br/>
eXchange with you again.  <br/>

For those who asked about what to do for design, I say "Have fun with it!".<br/>
<br/>
    Some folks do a picture that relates to their Trail Name, or Handle -<br/>
like having the name Wacky Weasel (not trademarked.  Go wild) and making a<br/>
weasel stamp.  Some find a neat store-boughten stamp and take their name<br/>
after it.  Some, like Diane and I, took the name "von der Insel" because it<br/>
means "from the island" in German, and our stamp is a sheep.  The sheep<br/>
stands proudly on the coat of arms of Jamestown, RI, where our island is.<br/>
    When we made personal stamps I carved a Medieval tower and she carved<br/>
what looks like three rings braided, but it's really one continuous<br/>
(moebius) briad.  (We still share the sheep when we stamp in, but put our<br/>
individual stamps and the stamp of those with us around the 'team stamp' von<br/>
der Insel).  Do what strikes your fancy.<br/>
    As I said "Have fun with it!"<br/>

  I have a question along these lines. I'm new to letterboxing, and I <br/>
  used a store-bought stamp to get started. I think I have decided on <br/>
  my "permanent" personal stamp now and hope to have it carved soon. I <br/>
  have only found a few boxes, and all of them were found in the past <br/>
