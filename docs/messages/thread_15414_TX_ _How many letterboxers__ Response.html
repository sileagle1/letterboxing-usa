                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! I didn't expect so many responses so soon! :) Thanks to all who <br/>
replied, and I hope to see more replies, as more Texans see this <br/>
thread. <br/>
<br/>
Don, thanks for the encouragement! Yes, I had heard "Plant them and <br/>
they will come.", but never with the 'numbers' - Only 14, <br/>
previously, in the considerable length of California really gives me <br/>
hope!<br/>
<br/>
Silver Eagle, Thanks so much for your very helpful, detailed reply. <br/>
So in a year's time, Texas letterboxers have more than tripled. Now <br/>
that IS great news! Yes, I had noticed that your letterboxes were <br/>
really spread out over great distances. Now I realize why. What a <br/>
great idea! I am working on spreading out my letterboxes more, but <br/>
it is slow going right now... we haven't been on any trips lately, <br/>
and there are none in the immediate future, except for an October <br/>
trip to Marble Falls, hopefully. We had already taken our major <br/>
cross country vacation for this year shortly before I 'found' <br/>
letterboxing. A 'First Texas Letterboxing Event' would be FANTASTIC! <br/>
I really do hope you and Baby Bear can organize one this winter. If <br/>
so, count me in!!!<br/>
<br/>
dvn2r ckr, Thanks for the heads up about the 'handful of extremely <br/>
motivated TX letterboxers'! I will be looking forward to hearing <br/>
from them when they are available again. About your two typical <br/>
responses to presenting the idea of letterboxing to others... LOL! <br/>
The responses I get are much more lukewarm, although they do <br/>
originate from the two poles that you mentioned. ;) So far, we have <br/>
only encountered one harmless snake, but also one humongous aligator <br/>
which quite unnerved me! <br/>
<br/>
Funhog... So letterboxers have more than quadrupled in OR - that is <br/>
also encouraging! The hobby/sport IS growing, just not fast enough <br/>
for me, I guess. LOL! Gosh, I do feel bad for that poor letterbox in <br/>
KS though! ...Makes me want to look at the list of KS letterboxes <br/>
when I finish this post. By the way, THANKS also for the boxes you <br/>
have placed down here.<br/>
<br/>
Barefoot Lucy, (Great nickname, by the way!) It's wonderful to hear <br/>
about 4 new letterboxers! Welcome! Maybe our paths will cross at <br/>
some point - I hope so anyway. I had a major shock over my poor <br/>
stamp carving abilities when I first began. My first stamps were <br/>
ridiculous! But now I have the hang of it, although there is still <br/>
MUCH room for improvement. LOL! <br/>
<br/>
California Bear, one response I got a couple of days ago was, "So <br/>
what do you win?" ROFLOL!!!! When I said that it wasn't that kind of <br/>
thing... that you get the enjoyment of the outdoor activity, and a <br/>
stamped logbook, etc., she said, "Well, I guess you can pass that <br/>
down to your grandkids." LOL! ....oh, well.... ;)<br/>

and I have another rest stop scoped out. Down here, with such a <br/>
distance between letterboxes, rest stops are pretty good places to <br/>
plant letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
San Antonio is 2 hrs. north from where I am. I hope to get up that <br/>
way to search for your letterboxes eventually.<br/>
