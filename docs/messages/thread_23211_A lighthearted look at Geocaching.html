                    <div class="plaintext-content">I realize I'm taking a risk by posting this message. With rumors <br/>
floating around that the Geocachers want to take over our hobby, some <br/>
people will probably have a hard time finding the humor in what I'm <br/>
about to share.<br/>
<br/>
But my friends and I have been taking a fun new look at the <br/>
Geocaching phenomenon, and have found a way to use it for our <br/>
benefit... namely to pad our F counts!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Don't misunderstand. I have never purposely gone looking for a <br/>
geocache. I have never planted one, or a hybrid box, for that matter. <br/>
They have never really interested me at all.<br/>
<br/>
But there are SO MANY freakin' geocaches out there, and some of them <br/>
are so large (and often so poorly hidden) that I can't help but <br/>
stumble onto them all the time when I'm out letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I've pretty much just ignored them. But I and some of my <br/>
friends (who, like myself, have been 'boxing for a good long time) <br/>
have been talking lately about the subtle differences between a <br/>
geocache and a letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
It occurred to us that both of them have clues (although of a <br/>
different sort) and a logbook to sign (or stamp) into. By definition, <br/>
the only thing a geocache lacks to keep it from being considered a <br/>
letterbox is a stamp image to collect.<br/>
<br/>
So, recently, when we stumbled onto yet another geocache, I <br/>
lightheartedly said, 'let's take a look and see what's in there.' <br/>
When we found a nifty heart-shaped eraser inside, I promptly inked it <br/>
up in pink and stamped it into my journal. I then stamped my <br/>
signature into the geocache journal and proudly proclaimed that I had <br/>
just added another find to my F-count.<br/>
<br/>
This prompted plenty of smiles, and a further discussion of the <br/>
topic. After some time, we all agreed that, on a technicality, I had <br/>
every right to claim this as a letterbox find. One of my friends did <br/>
insist, however, that I was obligated to clean my ink off the eraser <br/>
before returning it to the geocache, to keep from stirring up hard <br/>
feelings with the geocaching community. (Apparently, geocachers do <br/>
not have the same afinity for inky fingers that we letterboxers <br/>
share.)<br/>
<br/>
Later that day, we stumbled onto yet another geocache. There were no <br/>
rubber trinkets in this one, but by placing a piece of Fun Foam that <br/>
one of us happened to have handy behind the page of my journal, I was <br/>
able to get a very nice impression from the handle of a small <br/>
penknife that we found inside. This time, my friends were all eager <br/>
to collect the impression in their journals, as well.<br/>
<br/>
We all stamped into the geocache journal, and carefully wiped all the <br/>
ink off of the penknife before putting it back and rehiding the cache <br/>
(better than we found it!) As we made our way on down the trail, we <br/>
coined the term "cache-boxing" to describe our newly-discovered <br/>
diversion.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sharing this experience hoping that you will find humor in the <br/>
situation. If you are looking forward to scolding me for inaccurately <br/>
reporting my F-count, then you will be disappointed to learn that I <br/>
don't keep track of my finds anyway. To me, letterboxing is not about <br/>
the quantity of boxes I find (or plant), but the quantity of fun I <br/>
have while doing it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to lecture me about stripping away the artistry from the <br/>
hobby, then I can only tell you how much fun I've had since that day <br/>
picking and choosing which object or objects from a cache that I'm <br/>
going to use to create my own personalized stamp impressions to <br/>
represent the contents of my find.<br/>
<br/>
I do not take anything from the caches I find, nor do I leave <br/>
anything other than my signature stamp impression. I am still being <br/>
meticulous about following my friend's suggestion to wipe all the ink <br/>
off the objects I stamp before putting them back into the geocache. <br/>
And I must say that every geocache I have encountered was rehidden as <br/>
well, or in most cases better, than I found it.<br/>
<br/>
So if you are lighthearted enough not to take any of this too <br/>
seriously, I invite you to join me in my new sub-hobby of cache-<br/>
boxing. The number of letterboxes in the country just increased one <br/>
hundredfold or more! That should keep Pete and Wanda occupied for <br/>
quite some time!  :-)<br/>

I stamp into caches I stumble across all the time.  If I have<br/>
something that fits the cache, I'll leave it behind.  I never take<br/>
anything from the cache, but I never thought about taking an<br/>
impression from a cache's object.  Brilliant!<br/>
<br/>
In the end it's all about flipping through my log book and having a<br/>
stamp jog my memories of a particular day with friends.  Caches can do<br/>
the same.<br/>

    What I can't figure out about geocaching is what is the "fun" of<br/>
collecting a bunch of junk (pink erasers?!) ????   You know there will<br/>
always be those who leave cool stuff and those who leave crap, and those who<br/>
follow the "cool stuff" people and take all the cool stuff and only leave<br/>
crap.    Gee, what a nice hobby.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As fascinated as I am by technology, and as much as I want GPS in my car, I<br/>
can't ever imagine getting into geocaching, especially not after how much<br/>
fun letterboxing is.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You'll have to come out this way, not nearly so many caches littered<br/>
everywhere!  :-)<br/>

 Bring a bunch of store-bought stamps and trade then for every last <br/>
bit of Happy Meal toys in the geocache. Then put a note in the <br/>
geocache and advise that it is now a letterboxcache. Then when DMS <br/>
finds this cache he will get a regular stamp image.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] A lighthearted look at Geocaching<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I realize I'm taking a risk by posting this message. With rumors<br/>
floating around that the Geocachers want to take over our hobby, some<br/>
people will probably have a hard time finding the humor in what I'm<br/>
about to share.<br/>
<br/>
But my friends and I have been taking a fun new look at the<br/>
Geocaching phenomenon, and have found a way to use it for our<br/>
benefit... namely to pad our F counts!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Don't misunderstand. I have never purposely gone looking for a<br/>
geocache. I have never planted one, or a hybrid box, for that matter.<br/>
They have never really interested me at all.<br/>
<br/>
But there are SO MANY freakin' geocaches out there, and some of them<br/>
are so large (and often so poorly hidden) that I can't help but<br/>
stumble onto them all the time when I'm out letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, I've pretty much just ignored them. But I and some of my<br/>
friends (who, like myself, have been 'boxing for a good long time)<br/>
have been talking lately about the subtle differences between a<br/>
geocache and a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to us that both of them have clues (although of a<br/>
different sort) and a logbook to sign (or stamp) into. By definition,<br/>
the only thing a geocache lacks to keep it from being considered a<br/>
letterbox is a stamp image to collect.<br/>
<br/>
So, recently, when we stumbled onto yet another geocache, I<br/>
lightheartedly said, 'let's take a look and see what's in there.'<br/>
When we found a nifty heart-shaped eraser inside, I promptly inked it<br/>
up in pink and stamped it into my journal. I then stamped my<br/>
signature into the geocache journal and proudly proclaimed that I had<br/>
just added another find to my F-count.<br/>
<br/>
This prompted plenty of smiles, and a further discussion of the<br/>
topic. After some time, we all agreed that, on a technicality, I had<br/>
every right to claim this as a letterbox find. One of my friends did<br/>
insist, however, that I was obligated to clean my ink off the eraser<br/>
before returning it to the geocache, to keep from stirring up hard<br/>
feelings with the geocaching community. (Apparently, geocachers do<br/>
not have the same afinity for inky fingers that we letterboxers<br/>
share.)<br/>
<br/>
Later that day, we stumbled onto yet another geocache. There were no<br/>
rubber trinkets in this one, but by placing a piece of Fun Foam that<br/>
one of us happened to have handy behind the page of my journal, I was<br/>
able to get a very nice impression from the handle of a small<br/>
penknife that we found inside. This time, my friends were all eager<br/>
to collect the impression in their journals, as well.<br/>
<br/>
We all stamped into the geocache journal, and carefully wiped all the<br/>
ink off of the penknife before putting it back and rehiding the cache<br/>
(better than we found it!) As we made our way on down the trail, we<br/>
coined the term "cache-boxing" to describe our newly-discovered<br/>
diversion.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sharing this experience hoping that you will find humor in the<br/>
situation. If you are looking forward to scolding me for inaccurately<br/>
reporting my F-count, then you will be disappointed to learn that I<br/>
don't keep track of my finds anyway. To me, letterboxing is not about<br/>
the quantity of boxes I find (or plant), but the quantity of fun I<br/>
have while doing it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to lecture me about stripping away the artistry from the<br/>
hobby, then I can only tell you how much fun I've had since that day<br/>
picking and choosing which object or objects from a cache that I'm<br/>
going to use to create my own personalized stamp impressions to<br/>
represent the contents of my find.<br/>
<br/>
I do not take anything from the caches I find, nor do I leave<br/>
anything other than my signature stamp impression. I am still being<br/>
meticulous about following my friend's suggestion to wipe all the ink<br/>
off the objects I stamp before putting them back into the geocache.<br/>
And I must say that every geocache I have encountered was rehidden as<br/>
well, or in most cases better, than I found it.<br/>
<br/>
So if you are lighthearted enough not to take any of this too<br/>
seriously, I invite you to join me in my new sub-hobby of cache-<br/>
boxing. The number of letterboxes in the country just increased one<br/>
hundredfold or more! That should keep Pete and Wanda occupied for<br/>
quite some time!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

I always seem to have a fistful of store-bought stamps<br/>
in spite of the fact that I never buy them myself. <br/>
Maybe I should start leaving them in caches in case<br/>
another letterboxer finds the cache and wants to stamp<br/>
in!<br/>

<br/>
  I find that to be quite creative!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    What I can't figure out about geocaching is what is the "fun" of<br/>
collecting a bunch of junk (pink erasers?!) ????   You know there will<br/>
always be those who leave cool stuff and those who leave crap, and <br/>
those who<br/>
follow the "cool stuff" people and take all the cool stuff and only <br/>
leave<br/>
crap.    Gee, what a nice hobby.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As fascinated as I am by technology, and as much as I want GPS in my <br/>
car, I<br/>
can't ever imagine getting into geocaching, especially not after how <br/>
much<br/>
fun letterboxing is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You'll have to come out this way, not nearly so many caches littered<br/>
everywhere!  :-)<br/>

I do usually leave a note in any geocache I've found usually to let <br/>
them know that there is a letterbox in the area.  Geocaches as an idea <br/>
doesn't bother me, but the damage to the area around the caches does <br/>
make me sad.<br/>
<br/>
I guess now we can tell the geocachers by the strangely shaped ink <br/>
blotches on their hands--"did it look like a penknife imprint on that <br/>
guy's hands?"  LOL<br/>

Could you explain? I know there are tons more caches<br/>

a couple of hybrid boxes.<br/>

There are, but it seems to be a point of pride with some cachers not to use <br/>

<br/>
Very true and I have seen some that way, which I think is good.  <br/>
<br/>
I have met a few geocachers out and about while we were both searching <br/>
for our respective treasure on two different occassions.  While I was <br/>
able to stop and take a look around to pinpoint where my target was <br/>
and walk pretty much directly to it, the geocache group was spread out <br/>
looking in every possible place within the coordinates.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure not all geocaches are like this and that many geocachers <br/>
start recognizing the telltale signs like we letterboxers can.<br/>

&gt; There are, however, ways to write cache clues to<br/>

This is so true!  However, in our geocaching experiences we rarely <br/>
see the 'hints' used in a way that mitigates the damage to the area <br/>
in which the cache is hidden.  The tool provides so much potential <br/>
to protect the area but unfortunately it's rarely realized...  :(<br/>
<br/>
We also geocache without a GPS and usually only use 'social trail' <br/>
or 'grid square scavenging' identifiers to look for the caches or <br/>
hints that we discern from the often quite revealing online log <br/>
entries.<br/>

&gt; I realize I'm taking a risk by posting this message. With rumors <br/>
&gt; floating around that the Geocachers want to take over our hobby, <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; people will probably have a hard time finding the humor in what <br/>
I'm <br/>
&gt; about to share.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But my friends and I have been taking a fun new look at the <br/>
&gt; Geocaching phenomenon, and have found a way to use it for our <br/>
&gt; benefit... namely to pad our F counts!  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don't misunderstand. I have never purposely gone looking for a <br/>
&gt; geocache. I have never planted one, or a hybrid box, for that <br/>
matter. <br/>
&gt; They have never really interested me at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But there are SO MANY freakin' geocaches out there, and some of <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; are so large (and often so poorly hidden) that I can't help but <br/>
&gt; stumble onto them all the time when I'm out letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the past, I've pretty much just ignored them. But I and some of <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; friends (who, like myself, have been 'boxing for a good long time) <br/>
&gt; have been talking lately about the subtle differences between a <br/>
&gt; geocache and a letterbox. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It occurred to us that both of them have clues (although of a <br/>
&gt; different sort) and a logbook to sign (or stamp) into. By <br/>
definition, <br/>
&gt; the only thing a geocache lacks to keep it from being considered a <br/>
&gt; letterbox is a stamp image to collect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, recently, when we stumbled onto yet another geocache, I <br/>
&gt; lightheartedly said, 'let's take a look and see what's in there.' <br/>
&gt; When we found a nifty heart-shaped eraser inside, I promptly inked <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; up in pink and stamped it into my journal. I then stamped my <br/>
&gt; signature into the geocache journal and proudly proclaimed that I <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; just added another find to my F-count.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This prompted plenty of smiles, and a further discussion of the <br/>
&gt; topic. After some time, we all agreed that, on a technicality, I <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; every right to claim this as a letterbox find. One of my friends <br/>
did <br/>
&gt; insist, however, that I was obligated to clean my ink off the <br/>
eraser <br/>
&gt; before returning it to the geocache, to keep from stirring up hard <br/>
&gt; feelings with the geocaching community. (Apparently, geocachers do <br/>
&gt; not have the same afinity for inky fingers that we letterboxers <br/>
&gt; share.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Later that day, we stumbled onto yet another geocache. There were <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; rubber trinkets in this one, but by placing a piece of Fun Foam <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; one of us happened to have handy behind the page of my journal, I <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; able to get a very nice impression from the handle of a small <br/>
&gt; penknife that we found inside. This time, my friends were all <br/>
eager <br/>
&gt; to collect the impression in their journals, as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We all stamped into the geocache journal, and carefully wiped all <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; ink off of the penknife before putting it back and rehiding the <br/>
cache <br/>
&gt; (better than we found it!) As we made our way on down the trail, <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; coined the term "cache-boxing" to describe our newly-discovered <br/>
&gt; diversion.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm sharing this experience hoping that you will find humor in the <br/>
&gt; situation. If you are looking forward to scolding me for <br/>
inaccurately <br/>
&gt; reporting my F-count, then you will be disappointed to learn that <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; don't keep track of my finds anyway. To me, letterboxing is not <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; the quantity of boxes I find (or plant), but the quantity of fun I <br/>
&gt; have while doing it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want to lecture me about stripping away the artistry from <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; hobby, then I can only tell you how much fun I've had since that <br/>
day <br/>
&gt; picking and choosing which object or objects from a cache that I'm <br/>
&gt; going to use to create my own personalized stamp impressions to <br/>
&gt; represent the contents of my find.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do not take anything from the caches I find, nor do I leave <br/>
&gt; anything other than my signature stamp impression. I am still <br/>
being <br/>
&gt; meticulous about following my friend's suggestion to wipe all the <br/>
ink <br/>
&gt; off the objects I stamp before putting them back into the <br/>
geocache. <br/>
&gt; And I must say that every geocache I have encountered was rehidden <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; well, or in most cases better, than I found it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if you are lighthearted enough not to take any of this too <br/>
&gt; seriously, I invite you to join me in my new sub-hobby of cache-<br/>
&gt; boxing. The number of letterboxes in the country just increased <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; hundredfold or more! That should keep Pete and Wanda occupied for <br/>
&gt; quite some time!  :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Hunting!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I LOVE this idea - and to carry it a bit further -<br/>
&gt; &gt; I always seem to have a fistful of store-bought<br/>

&gt; &gt; in spite of the fact that I never buy them myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe I should start leaving them in caches in<br/>

&gt;  Bring a bunch of store-bought stamps and trade then<br/>
