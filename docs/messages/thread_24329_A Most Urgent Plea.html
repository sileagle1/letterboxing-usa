<br/>
      Salutations. My name is Emily Post. For those of<br/>
you who are not familiar with my reputation, I am the<br/>
foremost authority on proper etiquette. It is my<br/>
solemn duty to ascertain why etiquette is disappearing<br/>
from society. <br/>
<br/>
     Over the course of the last year, I have not<br/>
failed to notice the mention of letterboxing in many<br/>
publications throughout the country. This has brought<br/>
me to your group in the hope of finding an element of<br/>
society that has not lapsed in common manners. <br/>
<br/>
     Letterboxers, it seems, have not been immune to<br/>
the pitfalls of society. I have spent much time<br/>
perusing various sites only to find that many of you<br/>
are concerned with the lack of common courtesy. Yes,<br/>
horrifying as it may be, there is a lack of etiquette<br/>
today. How can this be? <br/>
<br/>
    Venturing into the groups archives in the hope of<br/>
finding answers, I have come to the only conclusion<br/>
that can possibly be reached. The Store of Good<br/>
Manners is missing! How has this happened? Who is at<br/>
fault? What can be done? <br/>
<br/>
    Enlisting the help of Investigator Francis Bacon,<br/>
I intend to find the answers to these questions. He<br/>
has assured me that he will act with propriety and<br/>
courtesy to all those he contacts. I also beg you, the<br/>
letterboxing community, to assist Investigator Bacon<br/>
in this most challenging of cases. If any of you have<br/>
word that can be of benefit in this most mysterious<br/>
situation, please send me an email. The choice is<br/>
yours, to act or not to act. <br/>
<br/>
Truly, <br/>
<br/>
Ms. Emily Post<br/>
