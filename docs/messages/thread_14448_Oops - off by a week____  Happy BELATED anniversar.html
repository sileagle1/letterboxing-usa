Well, I just hunted down the link to the Washington Post article for someone who requested it, and imagine my surprise when I noticed the byline date:  July 12, 2002.  So much for the 19th!  <br/>
<br/>
I for some reason had the weekend of the 19th-21st in mind as the first weekend we went letterboxing, but it must have been the second, because I KNOW we went out the same weekend the article came out (we could hardly manage to wait even a day.)  Now I have to go back and check my logbook to see what was so great about the second weekend that I remembered those dates instead!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to have messed up the dates, but happy anniversary anyway!<br/>
