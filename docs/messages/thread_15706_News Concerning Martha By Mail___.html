                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I have had it! Things here have gone from bad to worse. My <br/>
role model and mentor, Martha, has to go! We got into a tussle  <br/>
yesterday when she insisted on removing my figural poodle lamp from <br/>
my nightstand. "What self-respecting adult would have a large poodle <br/>
lamp base in their bedroom?" she said. Actually, she said a lot of <br/>
other things too, as she does not like to be opposed. But good <br/>
manners dictate that I don't repeat them here. Apparently `vintage' <br/>
only applies to washed out pastel pottery and dull old linens! <br/>
I laughingly pointed out that she should leave immediately, since <br/>
she have committed her to visiting about 60 households across the <br/>
country in her `whirlwind tour'. I said I would like to see her <br/>
straighten out THAT many households in time to  well, take care of <br/>
those pesky legal matters she has piled up. I thought I had won the <br/>
day when she turned on her heel leaving me and my poodle lamp to <br/>
talk it over and gloat with my sock monkey puppet I have taken to <br/>
constantly wearing on my arm and conversing through. She retreated <br/>
to her room, slamming the door behind her. <br/>
<br/>
However, we laughed too soon. I should have known that I could never <br/>
win out over Martha and her resourcefulness and perfection! Remember <br/>
in Dr. Suess's The Cat in the Hat, the dread and foreboding you felt <br/>
when Thing 1 and Thing 2 emerged from that box??? Well, magnify that <br/>
times 100! She emerged from her room this morning not once, but <br/>
three times! That's right ladies and gentlemen, she had cloned <br/>
herself while I was sleeping, smug in my supposed victory! <br/>
<br/>
Martha #1 is leaving in the morning to visit the first 20 people who <br/>
signed up. However, Martha #2 and Martha #3 will be breathing down <br/>
my neck and wreaking havoc in my household for a day or two longer. <br/>

<br/>
I'm a little nervous now, if Martha doesn't like<br/>
poodles and such, she's gonna have a field day in my<br/>
house - I wonder how she will feel about the gorilla<br/>
bust my husband proudly displays in our living room as<br/>
his "Uncle George" and his latest garage sale find, an<br/>
obscene little Okinawan nutcracker from the 1940's in<br/>
the female form which cracks nuts with her knees?<br/>
(PLEASE!  Don't ask me to describe it further - just<br/>
use your imagination).  <br/>
<br/>
I suspect she's going to tell me that unless I get rid<br/>
of the husband, the decorating is going to continue to<br/>
be horrendous.  Since I have kind of gotten accustomed<br/>
to having him hanging around all the time and I can<br/>
even be philosophical about the oddities he calls<br/>
"art", I would imagine Martha will only be making a<br/>
short stay, especially since our little house is fully<br/>
occupied and she's gonna have to sleep on the - ahem<br/>
-"vintage" couch.<br/>
