CA Bear's idea was similar to one that I have had recently with <br/>

things letterboxing. I think that having a separate list for <br/>
maintenance/status info would not necessarily make it another <br/>
discussion list.  If the status talk/list were used simply to state <br/>
what boxes need maintenance, appear to be lost, etc. it would free up <br/>
this list for the more interesting aspects of letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
IMO there are many advantages to a separate list.  If you want to <br/>
check on the status of a box you are planning on visiting you can <br/>
quickly search through the state listings and find info from recent <br/>
visitors.  I did a maintenance check on one of my boxes recently and <br/>
it had been six months since it had seen a visitor.  Anyone searching <br/>
through the big list for a posting on it would never have gone back <br/>
that far to see if anyone had posted info on it.  In addition, not <br/>
all people that place boxes read the talklist.  This would make it <br/>
easier for them to check on problems being reported on their boxes.  <br/>
(BTW, the excellent "contact the placer" function Wes put on the new <br/>

an easier method for determining its status.  <br/>

I think that's the best solution to this problem. But I'm also a <br/>
newbie and don't feel it's my place to get into all this too much. <br/>
Personally, I only read the post I want to, and I only read them <br/>
online. If I had them all sent to my email, I'd have a full box <br/>
already! LOL<br/>

give a new answer.  Who knew that a .5mm gouge existed! :<br/>

i would definitely use it, but then that's me.  i lbox during my <br/>
lunch break, so i have a very limited time period.  it's so <br/>
disapointing to get out there and not find it, then try again, not <br/>
find it, then try again.......like trying to find "the square" box <br/>
in cinci...i tried for weeks! later to find out thru personal mail <br/>
that the box was lost. <br/>
<br/>
i have brought this up before in a previous post, but there is a <br/>
database on this board (if you are on the web, look to the box on <br/>
the left hand side).  i asked some time ago, if the purpose of this <br/>
database was to keep track of boxes...it looks like it to <br/>
me....anyone know?  if the database is for housekeeping, there <br/>
wouldn't be a need for another message board...although i'm not <br/>
against this idea, but why double the effort when there is a vehicle <br/>
already in place?<br/>
<br/>
just a few thoughts. thanks for listening  :-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings everyone -- <br/>
<br/>
I have tried really hard to avoid the need to throw my two cents into this<br/>
mess -- it seemed everyone was doing a good enough job.  But since it seems<br/>
to be the hot topic of discussion I figured I would add my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think the SitRep posts are a good idea. I personally hate going<br/>
to look for a letterbox only to find out that someone was there last week<br/>
and found it missing and never told the group or that the placer didn't<br/>
mention it when they were contacted about it.  I don't think these things<br/>
need to be in great detail, but I do think it is a helpful and good idea<br/>
however.<br/>
<br/>
As for separate lists -- I already have 3 letterboxing groups that I am<br/>
subscribed too and I really would not want another one (Except the Pacific<br/>
Northwest Group list that I am still waiting on someone to tell me how to<br/>
get too!)<br/>
<br/>
I think something to keep in mind is that each one of us acts as our own<br/>
censor.  If you don't want to read something skip over it or exercise the<br/>
power of the delete key.  For those doing SitRep posts or posting adventure<br/>
stories, you might consider doing something to help make it stand out as to<br/>
what it is so that it is easy for those that do not want to read it to<br/>
recognize it and skip over it.  Perhaps "SitRep" and "LBA" (Letter Boxing<br/>
Adventure) as the first word of the subject line from such posts.<br/>
<br/>
For the grumps out there that are going to complain and kvetch no matter<br/>
what we all do -- you might want to just get out and go letterboxing a<br/>
little more -- get a little more addicted so that you feel the need to do<br/>
SitReps and LBA's too!<br/>

I know California Bear offered to set up a new list just for the<br/>
reports of boxes, and other members have also introduced the subject<br/>
(I'm sorry, at this moment I cannot recall your names).  I for one<br/>
would use a separate list because sometimes doing an archive search<br/>
here doesn't work because of the volume of results that need to be<br/>
filtered thru just to find what I'm looking for.<br/>
