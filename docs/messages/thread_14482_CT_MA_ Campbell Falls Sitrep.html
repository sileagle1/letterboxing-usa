lunch this weekend, and so I dragged him (he was very willing!) to Campbell <br/>
Falls SP.  We had a wonderful time listening (and watching) to the water coming <br/>
over the falls, he taught me about Glaciation (I knew about the process of the <br/>
glacial ice etc... but never knew it had a name....) and we sought out my <br/>
letterbox.  Only one couple had been there to box (Bob and Carolyn of The <br/>
Voyagers).<br/>
<br/>
Of course, our day didn't stop there... we stopped by the Land of Nod winery, <br/>
and also was to stop by Haight Vineyards, but they were having a very formal <br/>
private party (the winery still said that it was open), and we didn't feel <br/>
dressed up enough to walk in anyways, so we moseid on home.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you get up to the Falls, head out and do the CT Wine Trail too!  <br/>
Even though we only sampled one winery (btw... we liked the Chardonnay best), it <br/>
was a great day!<br/>
<br/>
So get out to Litchfield County everyone!  Its absolutely beautiful this time <br/>
of year!<br/>
