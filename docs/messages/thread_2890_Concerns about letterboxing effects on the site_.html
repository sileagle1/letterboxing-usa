<div>Letterboxers All !</div>
<div>    I'm sure many, if not most, 
of us have thought about this already, so you'll not be surprised that the 
superintendent of one of our major hiking trails has aired his concerns in 
<em>North Star</em>, the magazine of the North Country Trail Assn. (NCTA).  
In the July -Sept. issue Tom Gilbert, Supt. of the Ice Age/North Country Scenic 
Trails has a very thought-provoking discussion of the issues.  He notes the 
adverse effects of the foot traffic and 
possible disruption of resources . . . even of littering.  He points the 
finger at geocaching, as well as letterboxing.  Rather than rehash the 
points he makes, I invite you to visit the Website of the NCTA:  &lt;<a href="http://www.northcountrytrail.org">www.northcountrytrail.org</a>&gt; and 
look for the link to the article, "Geocaching - New Trail Activity? or 
Retreat from Accepted Trail Ethics?" in the right hand column of the 
home-page . . . or at some point it may be archived but 
accessible. </div>
<div>    As one involved in 
maintaining the Finger Lakes Trail, and the North Country Trail where it 
coincides, I'm well aware of the implications of citing a box along the Trail, 
whether on public land or private.  It becomes more critical in heavy use 
areas.  And I've also already offended the authorities by searching 
(turning over stones !?) in an archeological area.  I've followed various 
practices for obtaining permission on public sites;  prior inquiry, 
after-the-fact, or not at all (trusting the activity to be minimal and the 
practitioners suitably discrete).  </div>
<div>    I invite your comments and 
suggestions.  I've informed the author that I would take the issue to this 
TalkList, so he may be looking in to see the reaction.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would like to comment on a couple aspects of this editorial. First <br/>
I find the initial points he makes about letterboxing and geocaching <br/>
increase the demand for public sites irrelevant. Many activities are <br/>
conducted on public sites and that is why they are maintained- for <br/>
the public to enjoy. The point he makes about not burying letterboxes <br/>
or geocaches is well taken and one which most responsible <br/>
participants would endorse. The idea of not disturbing archeological <br/>
or environmentally sensitive areas is a general concern too, <br/>
photographers would create the same traffic as our participants which <br/>
is much more adverse than the mere existence of a letterbox or <br/>
geocache.  The issue of littering is more controversial, and one of <br/>
the reasons I have tried to begin developing StoneStashing. I can see <br/>
the argument for containers with man made objects being viewed as <br/>
trash by some people (though I don't agree). That is the reason that <br/>
when I started the thought process that led to StoneStashing I wanted <br/>
no unnatural objects of any kind involved. Admittedly the stones left <br/>
by participants are not "native" to a particular site, but they are <br/>
inert natural objects likely to be entirely unnoticed by anyone not <br/>
looking for them.<br/>
<br/>
I think his last paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
"I acknowledge the attractiveness of the "hunt" associated with these <br/>
activities, but I am left with a question in my mind: "Whatever <br/>
happened to the good old walk in the woods for the mere enjoyment of <br/>
doing so?"<br/>
<br/>
sums up where he is coming from. It is a mindset that why should <br/>
treasure hunting be invovled at all, if people don't appreciate the <br/>
woods just for the natural beauty. I find myself wondering why there <br/>
was no reference to orienteering. Obviously we all need to be <br/>
sensitive to the environmental impacts of our activities and keep <br/>
that in the forefront of our minds. Responsible recreating in public <br/>
and private lands is an individual responsibility whether you are <br/>
hiking, mountain biking, orienteering, hunting, fishing, <br/>
letterboxing, geocaching, stonestashing, or just out for a walk.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sure Mr. Gilbert has valid concern for worry.<br/>
I have seen the damages that over-use can cause to fragile ecosystems.<br/>
<br/>
Most recently in a city park where bicycles were allowed. The bikes <br/>
had carved deep 'V's in the inclined trails.  <br/>
Another instance was an alpine lake that had originally been <br/>
accessible only on foot and had been opened to auto traffic. The <br/>
ecosystem just couldn't stand up to the increased usage. The end <br/>
result was the destruction of the very thing that drew the public in <br/>
the first place.<br/>
<br/>
While letterboxing, geocaching and like activities have the potential <br/>
to cause damage; I believe it is up to the participants to act in a <br/>
responsible manner and limit excursions to the trail and to places <br/>
that can be reached without damaging indigenous plants and wildlife <br/>
habitat. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read the article by Mr. Gilbert and agree in general with his first <br/>
three points. I think that most of us already follow his third that <br/>
states not to bury the article.  I don't necessarily agree with his <br/>
fourth point.  Is it better to have an organized group of 50 <br/>
people "trampling" a section of trail etc. at once or would it be <br/>
less harmful in the long run to have that same number of visitors <br/>
spread over a year?  <br/>
<br/>
A few things came to mind when I read the article and the first one <br/>
is that change is not necessarily a bad thing.  If letterboxing can <br/>
encourage people to get out and enjoy new areas without impacting the <br/>
environment is that bad?  One of the things I enjoy most about the <br/>
sport is breaking out of a rut and not visiting the "same old trails" <br/>
over and over again.  On the other hand when I do visit a familiar <br/>
trail that has a new letterbox it is refreshing to see the area anew <br/>
through someone else's eyes.  <br/>
<br/>
The other point is that I don't see letterboxing as littering.  A <br/>
very small, discrete, inert object is carefully hidden, hopefully in <br/>
an area that will not impact the surrounding environment or cause the <br/>
seeker to adversely affect it either.  Thankfully in New England we <br/>
have lots of rocks and stone walls that make this part of the sport <br/>
easy.  It does not encourage people to increase the volume of <br/>
unnatural objects in an area.  Since most people involved in the <br/>
sport do so because of an appreciation for the environment they are <br/>
more likely than the average "walker" to pick up trash they do see.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You have said it all, Eric.  My first reaction to the<br/>
article was one of anger.  I was ready to let the<br/>
words fly, but having given it some thought, I have to<br/>
respect anyone who has a love and concern for anything<br/>
natural getting disturbed, or worse, trashed.  I love<br/>
the out-of-doors and as a teacher, focus a whole lot<br/>
on environmental issues, among them, "LEAVE NO TRACE."<br/>
 My kids know it and understand it by heart.  I have<br/>
fallen in love with letterboxing and wouldn't place my<br/>
boxes in any area or spot that would have the<br/>
potential to disturb anything, now or later.  Anyway,<br/>
in the process of trying to word a response, your<br/>
response came up and BINGO...it says it all.  As long<br/>
as we all are AWARE and cautious, what the heck...<br/>
let's continue to have fun without feeling the<br/>
negative impact a letter like that has the potential<br/>
of creating.  We are doing no harm, and let me tell<br/>
you, Peter and I ARE enjoying the hikes and walks for<br/>
the sake of the beauty around us.  The only difference<br/>
is a big old grin and that feeling of excitement when<br/>
we EVER so carefully plant a letterbox in a place that<br/>
will do no harm as it sits and waits and will do no<br/>
harm when people come and carefully search for it. <br/>
You know, it gets people out and about, and gets<br/>
people connected.  This is living life and having some<br/>
fun (carefully.)  I guess I got a bit long-winded<br/>
there.  I love letterboxing, Linda of PetLinK<br/>

cannot be ruled littering and/or damaging to natural resources until <br/>
other activities are ruled as such. Some of the arguments I can think <br/>
of (don't get me wrong, I enjoy a couple of these activities myself):<br/>
<br/>
Ski areas: they can be seen for miles, marked where trees have been <br/>
removed to create runs, as well as the installment of parking lots, <br/>
buildings and ski lifts.<br/>
<br/>
Horses on trails: why do dog owners have to clean up after Fido but <br/>
the horse rider isn't expected to clean up after their horse? Related <br/>
to this is all the mules used to carry people down into Grand Canyon <br/>
and back up.<br/>
<br/>
Orienteering: Orange courses and up take competitors cross country to <br/>
find the controls. Even yellow courses take competitors a little off-<br/>
trail at times.<br/>
<br/>
Boating and Snowmobiling: noise pollution, possible gas and oil <br/>
spills.<br/>
<br/>
Logging, mining, oil drilling. Enough said.<br/>
<br/>
Also, letterboxing brings people out to enjoy the parks, who <br/>
otherwise might not, thereby increasing the number of people who will <br/>
fight for open spaces, and bring in money where there is a land use <br/>
fee. It may also increase tourist spending in the area being visited. <br/>
I do agree it logically goes against the "take only pictures, leave <br/>
only footprints" but letterboxes aren't garbage, and if I see that <br/>
any of mine create a negative impact, I will promptly remove them.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The United States is fledgling in the development of the activities of<br/>
Letterboxing and Geocaching.<br/>
Letterboxing is not new to the world as we all know. Dartmoor is a park<br/>
inundated by treasure as well as the whole of England. What environmental<br/>
impact has letterboxing made "over there?" As a proponent of the Leave No<br/>
Trace ethic both personally and professionally, the article does raise some<br/>
good points. However, impact on the environment that a letterbox can have on<br/>
the environment is minimal in my honest opinion. The impact that a person<br/>
following a clue can have on the environment can be tremendous however. Some<br/>
clues can take us off trail which does conflict with the LNT ethic (which is<br/>
so liberally vague in the first place). Sorry folks, no one can make me<br/>
believe that bushwhacking in any form is BAD, BAD, BAD. Deer bushwhack every<br/>
day. I think bears do too. Some bushwhacking can be done without massive<br/>
harm to the environment surrounding it. Nature is self healing when you<br/>
apply it to minimal bushwhacking. Hence, my clues leave little impact to the<br/>
environment when you hunt for my boxes. However, some areas that have that<br/>
"sensitive" vegitation should not be trodden on to preserve the natural<br/>
order of the ecosystem that they co-exist with.<br/>
<br/>
Although I oppose any geocaching that involves containers that cannot be<br/>
easily hidden due to their size (i.e. 5 gallon buckets or ammo cans) I do<br/>
support geocaching in its provision of "the hunt" in the great outdoors. I<br/>
do have a problem with the movie industry (Planet of the Apes) using<br/>
geocaching to promote thier movie. I simply cannot find the correlation<br/>
between cache and ape. Sorry, I just don't get it.<br/>
<br/>
But, at any rate. As letterboxers/geocachers, i'm sure at some point we'll<br/>
all have to comply with some silly state or federal law hampering the "hunt"<br/>
on pulick lands. And, i'm sure, Connecticut will be one of the first<br/>
opponents of Letterboxing. Ever notice you can't camp anywhere in CT without<br/>
a permit?<br/>

were interested all had extensive outdoor experience. In this fast paced <br/>

of more electronic entertainment. Certainly not in my household, but in a <br/>

<br/>I just have to pipe in my .02 worth here (no change given, sorry) :o)  But 
<br/>our 4 kids (7,4,3,2) all love to "hide or find the box."  Our 7 year old 
<br/>knows how to use a compass.  Our 4 year old can follow clues, our 3 year old 
<br/>can find his way back to base no matter how far we have gone, and our 2 year 
<br/>old loves to carry the box and explore all the cool "treasures."  We have 
<br/>learned about volcanic rock, about tides, about first aid, and about working 
<br/>together as a family to solve a puzzle.  And none of that involved vegging 
<br/>out on the couch.  Living in Alaska, we see large wildlife quite frequently, 
<br/>but it is a different set of rules when you are in THEIR backyard (instead of 
<br/>them coming to your backdoor) and that is a great thing to learn, too.  I 
<br/>suppose I missed something along the way, but I don't see how Letterboxing is 
<br/>a bad thing at all.  In fact, we mention it to everyone we come in contact 
<br/>with and even hand out pre made boxes for others to hide (not a large 
<br/>population of current letter boxers here - all 2 of us - tee hee my husband 
<br/>and I have to hide them for each other since there isn't much challenge in 
<br/>finding the same boxes you hid)
<br/>Okay I think I am done rambling - feel free to wake up and go about your 
<br/>regularly scheduled lives.  :o)

                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Mark, your point about letterboxing being an inticement to get <br/>
kids onto the trail and into the woods is especially well-taken.  <br/>
This has been noted in many of the posts I've read here in the past <br/>
few months.  It's not only "good" but extremely important, not just <br/>
to the future of this activity, but to the younger generation <br/>
themselves.<br/>
    I'll have an opportunity to test that when my youngest <br/>
grandchildren, ages 5 &amp; 10, visit next month.  The older ones, to <br/>
whom I've made casual mention of my letterboxing exploits, merely <br/>
give me that "good lord, what's Gramps up to now ?" look. <br/>
    The author, Tom Gilbert, has been taken to task a bit too <br/>
severely by some, I think.  He has a legitimate point of view, as <br/>
caretaker of a resource. Does anyone who has visited a state or <br/>
national park recently think that vigilance and some formal rules are <br/>
not important to their preservation as recreational resources?  Some <br/>
one has to restrain those who don't care how they use these <br/>
facilities and to remind those of us who do care of acceptable use, <br/>
as well.  He's not so much 'protecting his turf' as doing his job, <br/>
and I salute him for that.  The flood of response to his article here <br/>
is testimony to the importance of his message.<br/>
