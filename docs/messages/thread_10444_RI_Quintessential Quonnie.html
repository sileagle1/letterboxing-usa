Quonochontaug, replaced this morning somewhere in Rhode Island. This <br/>
was our first mystery letterbox, originally placed in the Fall of <br/>
1999 and gone missing, perhaps taken by space aliens or quirky FBI <br/>
agents or even more mysterious smoking men but now back in <br/>
circulation. Good luck!<br/>

Drive all the way out to the northwestern tip, where the waters rush <br/>
through the breachway, and park where you shouldn't (everyone else <br/>
does). Walk west to the drop off, then pass south between barrier <br/>
rocks and count 85-90 steps to find treasure under the third <br/>
evergreen to the east.<br/>

<br/>I remember you saying that it was missing, but I also knew that it moved from bush to bush quite a bit, since I live down the street and checked on it often.  So, I decided last weekend to check on it, finding that it was indeed missing (I found the numerous stones that were piled on it).  I guess somehow, you got there between Monday and today.... sigh.... Guess I'm making a road trip before it disappears again!

Quick indeedy, before the summer RVs take up camp and the bored <br/>
residents of the RVs have nothing to do but call the Charlestown <br/>
Police when a seeker looks for this box.  Be there, done that, bought <br/>
the tee shirt, sent the post card, wrote the book report.  It was <br/>
because of that incident that my letterboxing name changed to:<br/>
