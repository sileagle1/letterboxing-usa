in Milwaukee, WI, I have been searching for months for<br/>
a good hiding place in downtown Chicago. At last I<br/>
found one and my 'box is ready:<br/>
<br/>
Chicago Underground letterbox<br/>
Cook County, Chicago, IL<br/>
Placed May 1, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Start at the Michigan Avenue bridge. Follow the stairs<br/>
half way down to the Wendella Boat Landing. Here you<br/>
will find an entrance to the Chicago Underground<br/>
system of streets. <br/>
<br/>
Entering the portal, continue in this direction for<br/>
two short blocks to a place to get something to eat,<br/>
something to eat, something to eat and drink.<br/>
<br/>
With a full belly to sustain you on your hike, now you<br/>
are ready. Look for a staircase nearby. Stand on the<br/>
stairs, facing down the staircase, and walk in this<br/>
direction. Continue on and over the bridge. <br/>
<br/>
After you have crossed the bridge, look to your left<br/>
for a passage which starts between 111 and 333. Follow<br/>
this all the way until it ends, where you will find a<br/>
door. <br/>
<br/>
Cross the hall, headed for the south shore. But now<br/>
look for a short stair which leads you back down to<br/>
the street and back on the sidewalk again.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the colonnade very nearly to its end, where you<br/>
will find the box hidden at the base of a pillar.<br/>
<br/>
A few caveats that should be included with the clues:<br/>
Please remember that this is an urban letterbox. The<br/>
underground passageways you will follow are all public<br/>
areas and are not dangerous, but you must be alert and<br/>
aware of your surroundings. A sizeable number of<br/>
people have made their homes in the Chicago<br/>
Underground since the 1930s. If you do not bother them<br/>
they will not bother you. The letterbox is not hidden<br/>
in an area where you might intrude upon these people.<br/>
Please be very discrete in your search for the<br/>
letterbox. What with all the current fears of<br/>
mysterious packages hidden in high-traffic areas, it<br/>
is imperative that you keep the existence and location<br/>
of this letterbox a secret. Once you find it, you may<br/>
want to move away from the immediate area to stamp up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
Matt the Rat<br/>
