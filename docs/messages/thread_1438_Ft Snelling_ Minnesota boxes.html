<br/>
Thanks, at least I wasn't imagining it....<br/>
<br/>
So, a few questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. How can we remove or note on the letterboxing.org web site that<br/>
they aren't there....<br/>
<br/>
2. Anyone else aside from me interested in putting some *other* boxes<br/>
around the twin cities?  (I'm already putting a geocache in, so a few<br/>
letterboxes would be fun, too)<br/>

Only the author can confirm the non-existance of a box.  Only<br/>
the author may initiate a change to clues.<br/>
<br/>
If the author goes missing, does not check on their boxes, etc, all <br/>
that can be done is to rely on the list archives or other word of mouth; <br/>
webmasters other than the author should not make change the clues (IMO).<br/>
Perhaps other people have other opinions.<br/>
<br/>
This is treasure hunting -- hunter beware.  <br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I found those boxes in March of '99, and did not think<br/>
they were particularily well hidden, so there is more word of mouth :-)<br/>
<br/>

Funny you should ask, Richard. I've been working on a "Missing in <br/>
Action" page that I was going to propose to the webmasters. As Randy <br/>
says, "it is treasure hunting," and sometimes missing a letterbox <br/>
doesn't actually mean it's missing. But for folks with limited time <br/>
or little kids, hunting for a box that is known to be missing is <br/>
fruitless and frustrating. Having a page listing known <br/>
missing/vandalized/winterized/etc letterboxes might be a good <br/>
resource.<br/>
<br/>
So, with that little push, give me a couple of days to spruce up this <br/>
proposed page and I'll put it up for comments.<br/>
