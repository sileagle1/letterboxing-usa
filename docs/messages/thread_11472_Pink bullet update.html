Yes, I've been to Quebec (among other places).  Bitter cold, ice on the St. <br/>
Lawrence, three and a half feet of snow... and way past winter carnival.  <br/>
Found the Pink Bullet in good shape.  Only the top of the cannon barrel was <br/>
protruding from the snow.  It was in good shape... but I'd like to suggest a <br/>
clarification:  The Pink Bullet isn't pink.  It's more like a magenta <br/>
bullet.  This may seem like a trivial detail, but what if, in theory, there <br/>
was a pink container in another cannon nearby?  Wouldn't that create some <br/>
confusion?  And what's the deal with the bullet?  In a cannon?  Shouldn't it <br/>
have been named The Magenta Cannonball?  Sorry to nitpick, but the details <br/>
are always important... beware the pink herring.<br/>
