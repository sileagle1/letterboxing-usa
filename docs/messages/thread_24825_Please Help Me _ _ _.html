<br/>
Sue &amp; I walked to Timberlin Park in Kensington, CT tonight after<br/>
supper to get a few letterboxes. And sometime during that walk, I lost<br/>
a rare, Roman coin that was a gift from my college roommate. This coin<br/>
has been with me as my lucky charm in Dartmoor and many other places.<br/>
<br/>
I had it in my pocket when I found Astri's monthly boxes and it was<br/>
there after we found Butterfly Suzy's new Yo-Yo box. After that, I<br/>
noticed a huge, debarked stump that it looked as if the woodpeckers<br/>
had visited and that was the last I remember it being in my pocket.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sick about losing it and I know, in the past, others have posted<br/>
about lost hats, glasses, etc. I hope the letterboxing community will<br/>
come to my aid.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Mark<br/>

I wish we were closer to the area so we could help you look.  However, <br/>
I believe that you are in good hands with the letterboxers. We were at <br/>
a gathering once when a woman lost the diamond out of her engagement <br/>
ring and sure enough within a matter of minutes that diamond was found. <br/>
<br/>
Come on boxers - let's get Mark's Lucky Charm back.<br/>

You let the cat out of the bag too quickly.  Very good Mark, but you <br/>
should leave a mystery be a mystery for a bit longer, just to see who <br/>

You've proved a couple of things--<br/>
<br/>
letterboxers care<br/>
<br/>
letterboxers will go the extra mile for each other<br/>
<br/>
old letterboxers never die- they lurk and read in the company of <br/>
their dead lemurs but come to the rescue of good friends<br/>
<br/>
clues abound if one is careful to take everything into consideration <br/>
and think outside the box<br/>
<br/>
The list lives! ;o)<br/>
