misconstrued!  This was about how I needed a GPS to get co-ordinates <br/>
to log in a find. And in my hubbys opinion the right tools for the <br/>
right job. Nowhere did I say to use GPS for clues.<br/>
   This reminds me of the game called' Pass it On. The story is <br/>
whispered to one person who then whispers it to another. Down the <br/>
line it goes. The person at the end tells the story and POOF it's <br/>
something else.<br/>
    After reviewing the archives, I tend to agree with Randy. Use <br/>
what is available. If you've got it, use it. If not, don't worry <br/>
about it. There is so much to choose from. Easy, like my first plants <br/>
or way more challenging, like Randys. <br/>
    Just remember that back in the day, Old Dartmoor didn't have <br/>
computers. I come from an age where we weren't allowed to use <br/>
calculators in High School. Now my kids are using graphing <br/>
calculators in Elementary School.<br/>
    Last week I did some easy finds, today I feel like doing some <br/>
research on one of Randys. I'm bound and determined to get one of his <br/>
stamps. Somewhere I read (in the archives) that getting one of his <br/>
stamps is like getting a badge of honor.  That's what makes this so <br/>
much fun. Variety!!!<br/>

  Nabbed the second box and off to #3. This is where we stumble <br/>
&gt; across our first Benchmark. For those out there it is a survey <br/>

site, <br/>
&gt; but it is pertinent to my story! DH is so excited to give me a <br/>
lesson <br/>
&gt; on benchmarks. I write down all the info. on the disk so I can log <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; in.  Later I find out I should have taken a picture. I don't have a <br/>
&gt; GPS to get the co-ordinates, but I can bet that Mr. Technology will <br/>
&gt; get a GPS soon!<br/>
