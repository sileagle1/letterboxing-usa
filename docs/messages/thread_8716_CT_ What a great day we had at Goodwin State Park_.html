                    <html><body>Darrin and I had a busy day today!  We headed out to Goodwin State Forest to find the Ants go Marching letterboxes and Chuck's Railroad Crossing and Tree is Me letterboxes.  
<br/>
<br/>We started with Chuck's Tree is Me, which we found the container wet, but the ziplocs inside kept everything nice and dry.  A very interesting way to hide a letterbox Chuck!!!!  However, I think Air Mail is still the best!!!!
<br/>
<br/>We also headed down to Chuck's Railroad Crossing only to find the Aloha Spirit Hitchhiker!  That was just one of the surprises we found today!
<br/>
<br/>Then we headed back to start the Ants go Marching letterboxes/microletterboxes.  This series was quite difficult.  Especially boxes number 3,5,6,8.  We had trouble with #3 because there are numerous double trees on the left.  There is a considerable distance between #2 and #3.  While looking for #5, we found Chuck's brand new Starry Starry Night, which we didn't even have clues for!  Then, as we were stamping into Starry Starry Night, we looked up and noticed an odd stone only to find the Eastern Mountain Sports letterbox!  Then we went on with the Ants.  While looking for Ant #8 (or was it #9) we found Chuck's brand new Here Comes the Sun Letterbox.  Keep in mind, we didn't have the clues for these.... we just happened upon them.  While looking for Ant box #10, we found a Troll Letterbox.  
<br/>
<br/>We had so much excitement on the Ant trail... (and the fact that we were running out of daylight) that we couldn't get to the Bear letterbox on the Natchaug trail.  We'll go out and get that one when we get the rest of Chuck's New Celestial Series.  When we got home, I found it hilarious to find an e-mail from the LBNA group with the Celestial Series clues!  Oh well!
<br/>
<br/>So all in all, we found the following boxes:
<br/>
<br/>The Ants go Marching Series
<br/>The Tree Is Me
<br/>Railroad Crossing
<br/>Aloha Spirit Hitchhiker
<br/>Eastern Mountain Sports
<br/>Starry Starry Night
<br/>Here Comes the Sun
<br/>Troll Letterbox
<br/>
<br/>Hopefully, we'll have another great hiking day next weekend to get the rest!  BTW... Chuck, if we weren't supposed to find those yet, we apologize :-)

                    <html><body><p>Hey Pam, I said my series of 6 was easy but it wasn't supposed to be that easy.To find Starry Starry Night and the EMS box you were way off the ant trail. I don't know how you found Here Comes The Sun. It's on the wrong side of the trail from #8 and #9 Ant boxes.  You must have had a long day out there. We had the hardest time with #8 but we managed to get them all and as you must have seen, we got a couple extra's too. Glad you had a good day out there. You sure did a lot of walking but finding all those surprises must have been great. Hope to see you guys again soon.....Chuck and Molly
