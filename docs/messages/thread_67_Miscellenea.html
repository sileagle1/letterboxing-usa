<br/>
My e-mail whas commatose for over a week and I've been reading frantically<br/>
to try to catch up with things...so I'll respond to a variety of things<br/>
ya'll have been talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Pooh and letterboxing.  I like Eeyore (?that spelling looks funny) and I<br/>
understand some of the magic of those stories and the maps, etc, but I<br/>
really don't see that we need to follow that too closely--especially<br/>
because we are a pretty creative group and can create our own characters.<br/>
I was setting up showrooms for the juvenile products show at the World<br/>
Trade Center and Pooh was done to death.  I'm sick of Pooh this and Pooh<br/>
that...sheets pillows plush toys curtains lamps dressers picture frames<br/>
blankets etc etc etc.  Letterboxing is not a mainstream hobby and I like<br/>
that! I think we can gather ideas from wherever we want to just as artists<br/>
have done forever--but I'd hate to restrict us to a Theme.<br/>
<br/>
The Letterboxing Congress and Muffaletta Fest a couple of weekends ago in<br/>
Dallas was GREAT.  Cool people are doing this!!  We really had a great<br/>
time.  I can hardly wait for one of those cool people to get another box<br/>
out there for me to find (not so subtle HINT HINT)!<br/>
<br/>
As to sexual biases...I'm with Deborah.  The subtle stuff sends powerful<br/>
messages.  Is this hobby for everybody?  Probably not, but sex has nothing<br/>
to do with who might be interested.  As a kid, I thought the boys got to do<br/>
all the fun stuff and girls got stuck with the boring work--I refused to<br/>
read books that had females for the main character for a long time--they<br/>
were so fluffy and tame...so I'm all in favor of interesting females doing<br/>
interesting, adventurous things.<br/>
<br/>
There's probably more, but I can't think what it is right now.  I love how<br/>
busy everybody is!  (Thanks Sheila, for getting the word out that there are<br/>
now 3 (three!) letterboxes in the Duck Creek series!)<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>
