  With clue sheet in hand, I walked with my husband to find "Eastern<br/>
Slopes Inn" l.b. in Nth. Conway. As we emerged onto the main trail,<br/>
Team Green Dragon appoached, clue sheet in hand. Small world indeed!<br/>
When stamping in, we discovered that Tweety/Mr. Coon and Mary<br/>
Manatee/Yacht's man had visited the area a few days before. Though<br/>
their stamp-ins were present at every box I visited, our timing was<br/>
such that I missed meeeting them.<br/>
Along with "Eastern Slopes", we visited "Black Cap". Incredible<br/>
panoramic views of the White Mt.s for a most managable climb. Highly<br/>
recommended hike (and l.b.). Box in fine shape, though logbook has<br/>
about a dozen pages left (one side of the pages stamped<br/>
into). "Cathedral Ledge" series consists of 3 nicely carved stamps<br/>
that fit together to form one image. I had some trouble finding the<br/>
second box, but persistance prevailed. My last successful find<br/>
was "Diana's Baths" l.b., also in Nth. Conway. Adorable stamp and a<br/>
heavenly spot for our Memorial Day picnic before heading back home.<br/>
"Glen Ellis Falls" l.b: I feel confident in stating this box is<br/>
gone. The clues are clearcut and I found the empty hiding spot. What<br/>
a shame!<br/>
"Thompson's Falls" l.b.: I feel fairly confident that this box is<br/>
gone. Hopfully, someone can allay my suspicions by commenting that it<br/>
is there or pulled for repairs.<br/>
So, I found 4 out of the 6 boxes sought, reluctant letterboxing<br/>
partner in tow. More importantly, due to the placement of these boxes<br/>
we visited some slices of peaceful heaven on earth.<br/>
