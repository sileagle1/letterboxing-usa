                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>We went to A.C. Moore in Holyoke, MA this morning to get supplies for our first planted boxes, which will be going out on Monday or Tuesday. They are having a sale this week on stamp pads (only 88 cents) and Strathmore artist pads (for $1.19), so that took care of pads and logbooks. I assume the sale is good at any store. We also picked up carving tools and blanks for our first attempts at carving. We've got some ideas for single boxes, and I've got a notion for a series if I can find the right palce to put them. Our first two boxes will be store bought stamps, one because it is perfect for where it is going and for the purpose of it being placed there, the other because it was cool, and would make a good letterbox. We'll just have to get carving!
<br/>
