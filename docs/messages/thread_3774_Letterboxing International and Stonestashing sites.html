and Stonestashing site being down the last couple of months. I <br/>
unfortunately needed to change ISP's and the details took much longer <br/>
than I had anticipated. They are now back up and I will be working on <br/>
them again. I may have them down intermittently while I do some work <br/>
on the computer but in general they should again be available. Any <br/>
questions you can contact me directly. Thanks much.<br/>
