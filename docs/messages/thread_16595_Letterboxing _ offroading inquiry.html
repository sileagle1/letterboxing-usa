I am curious as to how many if any of you are also 4x4 <br/>
offroading/rockcrawling/mudslinging enthusiasts/fanatics?<br/>
As so much of my family's bi-monthly outings are based on an offroad <br/>
event, I/we expect to plant boxes at various venues during our <br/>
travels ,i.e. MOAB, Rubicon, Farmington NM...<br/>
Most places open to 4x4 vehicles are not condusive to hiking, ok, the <br/>
normal hiking/backpacking, nor are they wheelchair accessible, but, <br/>
the groups that do this sport are very family oriented and there is <br/>
always a need to keep the kids occupied while waiting for a vehicle <br/>
to be "saved" from a precarious position atop a hill/boulder or stuck <br/>
in a mud pit.<br/>
If this is of interest to anyone, please let me know. Our offroad <br/>
season is more or less done until spring and I need winter projects <br/>
for the kids<br/>
<br/>
Not all in the Land of Ahhhs is flat, just most of it!<br/>
