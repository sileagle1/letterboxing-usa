                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Amy! I think the first Valley Falls letterbox (Vernon, CT) was a <br/>
little precariously placed. When I went up there it was in plain <br/>
view, and that's a popular party spot for the local teen crowd. I <br/>
spent some time hiding it better with rocks and bark, but it could <br/>
certainly have been found, laughed over, and tossed off the cliff by <br/>
now. I really hope not: anyone else seen it lately?<br/>
<br/>
Did you try for the new Valley Falls letterbox on the Airline Trail?<br/>
