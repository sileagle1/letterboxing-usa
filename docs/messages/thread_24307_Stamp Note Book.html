                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been using the 4x6 strathmore series 400 drawing pad in my <br/>
boxes. I like how it holds the the ink and that are the right size for <br/>
me. It only has about 24 pages in it and on my one drive by that pad <br/>
only lasts about 6 months. I saw a strathmore 300 series sckth pad with <br/>
100 pages that is actually 3.5x5 and would acual fit in some containers <br/>
I would like to use, but the paper is not as heavy. Has anyone used <br/>
this paper and how were the resualts? It's only about $2.50 so I can <br/>
try them out<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to see what you guys thought. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
