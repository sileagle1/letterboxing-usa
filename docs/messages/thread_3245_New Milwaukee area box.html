Location: Hubertus, Wisconsin (add to Milwaukee area, Southern Wisconsin<br/>
Letterboxes)<br/>
Terrain: easy<br/>
Planted: September 2, 2001<br/>
Clues: To find this box one must follow His way. After falling the third<br/>
time, but before being stripped of His garments is an unpaved path not of<br/>
Righteousness leading away and down. Examine the largest wood pile for that<br/>
which is hidden. After it is revealed, continue up to the last of the<br/>
Stations and climb as high as you are able for one of the finest views in<br/>
southern Wisconsin. An interesting landmark regardless of your belief.<br/>

Unless you want to see a lot of people or attend services avoid Sunday's.<br/>

Dierdra has planted another box at Tyranena Park in Lake Mills, WI about 30<br/>
minutes outside of Madison.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you find Holy Hill. I think it's an easy one, but I'm sure<br/>
everyone who plants one thinks that.<br/>

So, if one were to go up to Milwaukee hunting for this new box, do <br/>
you suppose that it's possible to hit Tyranena, search for some <br/>
Madison boxes and still come home to Chicago the same day? :)  I <br/>
guess overnight in Madison wouldn't be such a bad idea.  Is the Eagle <br/>
letterbox along the way to Tyranena too?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Just kidding Amanda!  You know I love this stuff thanks to you!!!<br/>
<br/>
Um, hubby contracted a bad rash during the last round of <br/>
letterboxing.  I don't know that he'll be to eager to set forth again <br/>
come to think of it :(.<br/>

<br/>
I think you could do Milwaukee &amp; Madison in one day.  It would be a long<br/>
day, but it can be done.  Once I made Door County a day trip and had a<br/>
great time!  A lot of driving, though!!!  Madison is a great town and<br/>
staying there is not a horrible thing.  There used to be (might still<br/>
be) a great Turkish restaurant there that starts with an "O", I think.<br/>
It was a great dining experience, so you might keep that in mind when<br/>
you get hungry in that town! <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Forget Madison. The only box still there is the Otis Redding, and frankly it<br/>
isn't much of a challenge. Tyranena is a temporary place holder and in my<br/>
opinion not as interesting as the missing Aztalan. Eagle is nice, and maybe<br/>
35-40 minutes southwest of Holy Hill.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I would do.  Give me a week to plant my "Calatrava" box down<br/>
near the new Art museum. The area is wonderful, along the lakefront, with<br/>
our new landmark art museum expansion (opens Sept. 14) If you enjoy unique<br/>
architecture, there's nothing like it. (Think Sydney Opera House wonderful.<br/>
Look up: Milwaukee Art Museum) It's also near the 120 foot, handmade Lake<br/>
Michigan schooner.<br/>
<br/>
Then you would have at least three, (Holy Hill, Calatrava, Eagle) close by<br/>
and you can see a variety of different scenery. If you like baseball, visit<br/>
the new Miller Park for an evening game.<br/>
<br/>
 Have you done any Geocaching? Sounds interesting.<br/>
<br/>

Okay, Bob...we're going to wait for your box before planning any <br/>
trips.  Besides, I need to figure out how to protect the hubby from <br/>
picking up anything while letterboxing.  The bad rash was pronounced <br/>
as "poison ivy" by the doctor today.  I had no idea Door County had <br/>
poison ivy!<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to see your letterboxes.  This is bad...I've always passed <br/>
on going to Holy Hill and now I'm going because of a <br/>
letterbox...sheesh! :)<br/>
