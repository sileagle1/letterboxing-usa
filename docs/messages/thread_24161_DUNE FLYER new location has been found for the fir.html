<br/>
last october we checked on DUNE FLYER and everything was just fine<br/>
we returned a few days later<br/>
and OH MY GOODNESS!!<br/>
construction crews were clearing the area where DUNE FLYER lived!!!<br/>
<br/>
kind workers had rescued DF and taken it to the DPW office<br/>
and were going to contact us <br/>
but we were able to thank them personally and took DF home with us<br/>
<br/>
we went back to cape cod in NOV <br/>
replanted and adjusted the clues<br/>
and waited<br/>
<br/>
HOORAY....last weekend <br/>
the DUNE FLYER was found in it's new home<br/>
<br/>
ain't life grand?<br/>
