This is the most ancient of Illinos boxes.<br/>
<br/>
It was posted way back on the original LbNA page by racheal.  A few years ago <br/>
before heading up there I attempted to contact her but I don't think she is <br/>
still letterboxing.  Just due to the nature of the location, I'd be surprise if <br/>
it has survived. I am just assuming it is orphaned and Matt the Rat is <br/>
babysitting it, if it exists.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone found it ?  If your heading that way it would be fun to check it <br/>
out.<br/>

been there a number of times before so you would think I would know<br/>
exactly where it was hidden! <br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid it may be gone, but I'd like to scour the area another time<br/>
just to make sure someone didn't put it back in a different location<br/>
(there are only a few possible hiding places there). It'd be very sad<br/>
if it really is lost, because that logbook had so many old and<br/>
interesting stamps in it. The box had been there since fall 1998!<br/>
