Just had to say it was great, albeit briefly, to see the nice smiling <br/>
friendly faces at RI's recent mysterygathering! Sorry we missed <br/>
legerdemaine, lonemasswolf, and others! We did, however, <br/>
catch the unveiling of the new little "dressed-up box" version of <br/>
K-Martha, which we had originally thought would be the same <br/>
standard tupperware K-Martha hitchiker that we had found in <br/>
Oregon on our trip at the end of May, and had put out shortly <br/>
thereafter at one of our own mystery boxes, appropriately <br/>
enough, "Going Downhill"! She was still patiently waiting there <br/>
the last time I checked about a month ago,  as I recently wrote to <br/>
legerdemaine, but now it seems that both "Going Downhill" and <br/>
"K-Martha HH" have finally been found by Laurette on her second <br/>
try after a couple of months!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, now here's the question, legerdemaine:  How are we <br/>
supposed to count them? K-Martha #1 and #2? K-Martha the <br/>
hitcher and K-Martha the event stamp? Perhaps they are like <br/>
those ants we were counting? But the ants were all different and <br/>
these stamps are almost-but-not quite identical! Not that I mind <br/>
clones, mind you. Some of the first stamps I found in Maine were <br/>
clones because the person who put them in thought that all her <br/>
plants were supposed to have the same-type stamp (but at least <br/>
the boxes had different names!)  Same with a few boxes around <br/>
here in southern New England where, for example, "And a little <br/>
rose too" and "Elizabeth Park" have the same stamp (with <br/>
bought stamps it was only a matter of time!) Anyway, what I think <br/>
happened here is that some folks just didn't realize that we only <br/>
rarely post our hitcher finds on-line because we don't want folks <br/>
to get too annoyed with us, or think we're trying to "hog the show". <br/>
(We have, after all, now found over 50 hitchers, but please try to <br/>
remember that that's still less than 4% of our total count, and we <br/>
do try to get them back out quickly!) Pete also doesn't always <br/>
update his hitcher webpage if he wants to keep something <br/>
special as a surprise, as he tried to do with K-Martha, but I <br/>
dropped a hint anyway, since I didn't want anyone on the West <br/>
Coast to be disappointed that she'd headed East.  Meanwhile, <br/>
unbeknownst to us, Funhog admitted to us on Saturday that she <br/>
had been repeatedly checking our webpage for K-Martha <br/>
updates and didn't find any! Poor thing, she probably  thought <br/>
WE were hitchkiker kidnappers - heaven forbid! Anyway, now <br/>
we're blessed with 2 K-Marthas, so what do we do?  As the old <br/>
Polish song goes, my vote would be to just have fun with the <br/>
both of them!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Wanda<br/>
