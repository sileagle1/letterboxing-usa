We have made up our first letterbox/geocache hybrid  with the following directions and clues:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ETOWAH CHIEF LETTERBOX/GEOCACHE<br/>
<br/>
This geocache and letterbox will proved you with a nice walk along the Etowah River in Canton GA, about 40 miles north of <br/>
Atlanta.  Roundtrip distance is about three miles with some off trail walking to get to the cache/letterbox.  For geocaching <br/>
information, go to http://www.geocaching.com.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
1.  In Canton, go to the bridge over the Etowah River, which has GA HwyS 5 and 140 crossing it.  If driving north, at the north <br/>
end of the bridge turn left into Boling Park.  If you were to <br/>
turn right, you would Sparkle!<br/>
<br/>
2. Drive about 0.7 miles to the area of the walking track.  Depending on the time of year, you may see many soccer games in <br/>
progress as you drive by the fields.  Our future World Cup champions are growing up and learning the sport.<br/>
<br/>
3. Park near the picnic shelter and look for the wooden sign which shows the Etowah Trail, a white blazed trail that will go <br/>
down along the River.  The white blazes are not consistent on the first part of the trail, but get your items together and head <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
4. You will cross Puckett Creek using a bridge that was made by the BSA Troop that also laid out the trail.  Do not follow a trail <br/>
up Puckett Creek.  The bridge is just a few yards from the River.  Record the number of the BSA Troop that built the bridge, <br/>
because you'll need the number later.<br/>
<br/>
5. Follow the trail along the river.  Nice easy walk!  In a short distance you will see a rock outcropping on the right with the <br/>
names "J.M. Williams  L.C. Carner" chiseled into the rock.  There are two dates to the left of the names, one date above the <br/>
other.  Record the lower (bottom) date, which is the number of a year.  Yep, you'll use this number later too.<br/>
<br/>
6. Continue your walk observing the beauty of the River and forests.  Reflect on the Cherokee Indians who once hunted these <br/>
woods, fished in the river, and farmed the bottom lands. Soon you will walk around a rock outcropping that is higher than your <br/>
head.  After passing the rock outcropping, the trail gradually leaves the River.<br/>
<br/>
7. Continuing on the trail you will come to a place where the white blazed trail crosses over a small foot bridge, but before the <br/>
bridge an orange blazed trail and goes away on a heading of about 350 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
8. Proceed on the orange trail about 65 paces to a large beech tree with an orange blaze.  Now, for the first time, you will go <br/>
off trail.<br/>
<br/>
9. From the beech tree, walk up hill about 50 paces on a heading of 115 degrees. You should now be near an oak tree with a <br/>
cavity in its base.  A small container is in the cavity, and inside the container is a sheet with a clue to be followed.  Please <br/>
replace the clue sheet and container when you finish deciphering the clue.<br/>
<br/>
10. If you followed the clue properly, you should now be near a fallen tree. A white quartz stone, about 2 feet in diameter, rests <br/>
three paces beyond the fallen tree. Now, recall the BSA troop number and subtract 226 from it.  This results in an azimuth, <br/>
which, if walked for about 40 paces, will place you in the vicinity of the cache/letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
11. Celebrate by singing the following song (To be sung to the tune of  " 'Neath the Crust of an Old Apple Pie")<br/>
<br/>
Near the base of an old fallen tree,<br/>
There is something for you that's from me.<br/>
It could be a pen that I just dropped in,<br/>
But it's really a box with things to see.<br/>
<br/>
So take out your stamp, take a look,<br/>
As you post your own stamp in the book.<br/>
Then press the box stamp to your page elegant<br/>
As you rest near the old fallen tree.<br/>
<br/>
12. Exchange stamp impressions, record any comments you wish to make, then carefully replace the box.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmus and SpikesMom are happy to have shared these lovely locations with you.  Best wishes for your future quests.<br/>

Note: Customary disclaimers apply.  Be careful. You must be responsible for your own safety. Be aware of poison ivy, stinging <br/>
nettle, possible snakes, etc. when out in the woods anywhere.  It's a good idea to wear bright colors in the woods, especially <br/>
during hunting season.<br/>
