<br/>
We all appreciate new boxers. After all, new boxers perpetuate the work<br/>
of veterans. If there were no new letterboxers, who would search for our<br/>
boxes? And new boxers means new talent and new ideas and more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I see letterboxing as an onion [pardon the metaphor] - peel the layers<br/>
away and find: one layer is the talk list - another the website -<br/>
another personal websites - another mystery clues - another WOM's -<br/>
another gatherings . . . you get the idea. <br/>
<br/>
The website and talk lists are just the surface.<br/>
There's plenty more to be discovered and hopefully you will soon attend<br/>
a gathering and participate in the great joy of meeting great people who<br/>
share a common love. <br/>
<br/>
Warning - not all of these layers of the letterboxing onion are for<br/>
everyone. Throw those layers away that hold no interest for you but hold<br/>
on to those that spark your imagination and creativity. This game is<br/>
much more than you've experienced so far and I envy you that discovery. <br/>
<br/>
And I don't just mean you - it's the general new boxing public. But<br/>
don't think we do not want to see new letterboxers. We encourage and<br/>
support you all.<br/>
<br/>
If I can ever be of help to anyone - don't hesitate to email me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! [And start peeling away the<br/>
letterboxing onion!]<br/>

 kerri - i hope you don't have to duck from the flames maybe a fire<br/>
extinguisher would come in handy? but seriously you did raise some good<br/>
points. i think as newbies it is often hard not to be defensive. the posts<br/>
aren't aimed at all newbies, or even just newbies. they are aimed at all of<br/>
those who do not respect the art of letterboxing. give yourself some credit.<br/>
if you have done well in your rehiding and teaching then you are indeed a<br/>
letterboxer. the clues would have found themselves to you. life is like that<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kerri, it may feel like you'd never be able to play right now w/o the LBNA &amp; other website clues, but I'm willing to bet that you won't have to wait terribly long before WOM or other somewhat secretive clues come your way. You never know how it will happen.   I too had never met another letterboxer in 5 months of boxing.  I still haven't met one on the  trail, after 6 months.  But I was able to get to the last wee hours of a letterboxing even near me (Washington's Crossing) and meet a few people because a kind letterboxer saw my post here and figured out that her spouse, by coincidence,  had hired my music group to play a concert.  I was able to ride with her to the gathering, and then discovered her boxes were the second and third ones we'd found.  Once there, I met some very nice people and was served Judy B.'s special Swedish Egg Coffee (Was that what it was called, SeeSowBizzy?!)   Since then, (but not due to the gathering) other kind people here have emailed clues when I showed interest in certain areas.  This was a complete surprise, as I never expected it to happen that way.  As you show interest and good intent and real caring for this hobby/sport/game/whatever, trust will grow and clues will probably become apparent to you that you won't expect.  Remain hopeful, watchful, and patient!  And thanks for planting--- I haven't gotten to that yet, but am plotting and planning just the same.  When I do, I promise they won't be thrown together or unloved !   --lunaryakketyact <br/>

Here's another perspective on this WOM thing. I have a<br/>
love hate thing going with my computer. E-mail and<br/>
getting all types of info from the internet is now<br/>
just a routine part of almost everyones day and I've<br/>
been dragged along kicking and screaming. For me it' a<br/>
great relief I don't have to get every clue from a<br/>
computer.  I don't really like communicating with<br/>
people via e-mail, it just lacks something for me. I<br/>
don't want to be left in the dark in this age of the<br/>
computer but things some people take for granted with<br/>
computer usage are hard for me.  I think ther's a<br/>
striking dichotomy between the art of letterboxing and<br/>
it's ultimate source the computer.<br/>
