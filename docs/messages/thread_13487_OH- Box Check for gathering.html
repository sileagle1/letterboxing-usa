Since today was the only day this week that didn't have rain in the<br/>
forecast, will it ever give us a break? Actually, it was a beautiful day and<br/>
NO BUGS! After the swarms we dealt with in Michigan, it was so nice to be<br/>
able to spend several hours in the woods without being covered in bug spray!<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
To those of you planning to attend the gathering, here's the list of boxes<br/>
to pull clues for :-)<br/>
<br/>
Trail #1<br/>
Happy Dog Box #1- Box was filled with water, but contents were dry.<br/>
Bonus Box (by Franzsolo) - Box had disintegrated, but contents were dry, I<br/>
replaced the box.<br/>
Happy Dog #2 - Good Condition<br/>
Happy Dog #3 - Outer baggie was a gonner, but the container held up<br/>
<br/>
Trail #2<br/>
Colorful Castle - fine<br/>
GEOMETRIC- GONE (as reported) If you have the clues to this one, don't<br/>
bother bringing them. Do check before you come to the gathering though,<br/>
because I plan to replace a box near there as well as place at least one<br/>
more box on this trail.<br/>
<br/>
Trail #3<br/>
Harry Potter - all OK<br/>
Purple Mtn. Majesty (by Team Mad Dawg) - great box, good cond.<br/>
Which Way - good<br/>
In Honor of...- Critter tasted the box, but a new baggie was all it needed<br/>
The Giant - good<br/>
Badlands Trail Box (by Franzsolo - not yet posted) - good<br/>
<br/>
Waterbird is not on a trail and might not be accessible during the gathering<br/>
if the shelter near it is full of people. The park employees did a lot of<br/>
work near this one and it is not nearly as well hidden from view during<br/>
retrieval/replacement (they cut down a tree and some brush and dumped a pile<br/>
of rocks nearby), but they didn't find the box!<br/>
<br/>
Scoutdogs (who finally tallied numbers from last week)<br/>
F-166<br/>
P-27<br/>
E-5<br/>
X-62 !<br/>
