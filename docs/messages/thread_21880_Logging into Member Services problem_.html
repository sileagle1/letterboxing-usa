I've been trying for over an hour.<br/>
<br/>
I have two new boxes to enter and three existing boxes to edit, and <br/>
when I try to login to Member Services, it accepts my email address and <br/>
password, then flips back to the main LbNA page as if I had never <br/>
logged in.<br/>
<br/>
And yeeeees, I have tried all the usual tactics (clearing temp internet <br/>
files, deleting cookies, heck - even rebooting my machine).<br/>
<br/>
So, is anyone else experiencing this problem, or is it just me?<br/>

Oh, good!<br/>

I mean ...<br/>

Not that it is good for *you* but ....<br/>
<br/>
Oh, good, that it could be a system wide problem and that it is not <br/>
just me.<br/>
<br/>
On the previous database, the problem *was* just me, and I couldn't <br/>
enter any of my own boxes.  I had to have one of the webmasters enter <br/>
them for me.<br/>

I emailed Choi.  I'll let the Master do his work.<br/>
