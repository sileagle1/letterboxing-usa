I think the work you've done on the web page, and on the logo is spectacular. I think you're truly one of the cornerstones of the group and I'd like to personally thank you for all your time and effort. <br/>
We've been discussing the logo and I feel perhaps your efforts and artistry have not been duely recognized. I think the logo is grand and would be proud to use it. If the group feels it's a little too patriotic or whatever....its a "marketing" decision, not an artistic one.<br/>
<br/>
Your graphics are so professional--you must be in the biz? I'm in marketing (on the administrative side) and can recognize professionalism. My hat's off to you.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing more of your great ideas--I wish I had the time and talent to contribute as much.<br/>

&gt;suggestion to use something very simple, like a line drawing &gt;superimosed with the words "Letterboxing USA" in a smaller,<br/>
&gt;simpler font I think is a good idea too.  I'm happy there are<br/>
&gt;people who care enough about this to give their input.  Personally,<br/>
&gt;I don't think about it that much, but that does not mean its<br/>
&gt;not important.  I think you are all important, so if you're thinking<br/>
&gt;about this its important to think about.<br/>

I second this! Mitch has been a great source of energy in this hobby for<br/>
some time now. We are all in his debt, altho I am sure it has been an<br/>
equal measure of fun for him!<br/>
