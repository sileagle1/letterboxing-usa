these days--all of these new boxes popping up everywhere will guarantee that <br/>
every weekend until May will be busy (unless it takes us that long to find the <br/>
Calico Honeymoon box...).<br/>
<br/>
The PC Letterboxing Guild has been out and about, introducing new members to <br/>
the sport. And, in doing so, we've located a number of boxes: Martian Maggot's <br/>
Monster Cereal series (great stamps--the pictures are funny!) and Rutgers <br/>
Gardens, as well as a couple of old PCLG favorites which were new to our new <br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
And, a well-timed trip to South Carolina brought me within sight of the <br/>
"Wright Stuff" letterbox, which was a welcome addition to my stamp book (J. <br/>
Steven, I like your A-Z concept--it's a good idea). I let the first PCLG <br/>
hitchhiker off there, but being the airhead that I am, I forgot to enclose a <br/>
notebook with it. Oh well, I guess it'll just have to travel lightly.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we've planted new letterboxes ourselves (clues to follow shortly), <br/>
and the postings are already up on our website, along with pictures of our two <br/>
new hitchhikers. Speaking of pictures, you can check out the new photo <br/>
galleries and see pictures of us finding boxes and getting lost and hurt in the <br/>
woods, as well as plenty of pics from old film we finally had developed. Stop <br/>
on by http://www.pcdx.com/pclg and catch the magic (yawn...).<br/>
