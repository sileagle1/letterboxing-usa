you while you were in Boise.  Oh well, it was for a good cause :)  I'm glad<br/>
you are finding more boxes and I'm sure glad you got your fun sister into<br/>
this wonderful hobby.  It has brightened it for me.<br/>

happy hunting,<br/>

After a few months of very sporadic letterboxing (read major hiatus),<br/>
we were able to finally find our 500th letterbox today.  It is only<br/>
fitting that we found one of A-Bear's letterboxes as our 500th<br/>
find!!!  The Star in Star, ID was the lucky letterbox.  Thanks A-Bear<br/>
and all of the other awesome letterboxers past &amp; present who have<br/>

Between lots of new letterboxers and so many incredible letterboxes <br/>
in the region--this area is definitely a letterboxing hotspot! <br/>
Everybody needs to venture out to this here state to find these <br/>
really cool letterboxes!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Cadenza for the nice comments!  Can't wait to get some time to <br/>
tackle tons of your new letterboxes in the region, too!  So many <br/>
letterboxes, so little time...  :(  Had we only known about <br/>
letterboxing three years ago when we drove all over this state!!!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail sometime...<br/>
