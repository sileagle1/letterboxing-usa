<p>I absolutely loved your Merlin's Grotto letterbox at Sleeping Giant!  I loved the cave, although I didn't go all the way down into it.  Although I did have a small flashlight with me, I was concerned that since I was by myself that I might get all the way down in there and then have trouble climbing out again.  But it was fun just to find the cave and to go in a little ways.  This box has a beautiful stamp too!</p>
<p>I also enjoyed finding the Sword in the Stone, and the two remaining Drewclan boxes (Right Knee and Hezekiah's Knob) that I didn't have time for the last time I was at the Giant.  Thanks everyone!</p>
