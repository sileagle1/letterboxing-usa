                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello to all. Well, we finally made it to Mansfield today. No rain <br/>
gear needed-YAY!!! Just bug spray-OY- the mosquitos have grown with <br/>
all the wetness.  Any way, we started with Chuck's Lost Marker, and <br/>
went on to do the south elephant series-- not exactly in the smartest <br/>
order, but done.  Took a break @ Kathy John's for lunch, then went <br/>
back for the north series of pachyderms-- great stamps-- I was glad <br/>
to see that Babar made it into the bunch.  Also got Sasquatch in that <br/>
mix somewhere.  Toad dog had a great time- loved all the streams. <br/>
Check out the boxing doggies to see a new photo of Toad- looking <br/>
quite handsome at The Lost Marker. I was tempted,myself, to sit and <br/>
ride the current at the old dam!  Lots of wet footing, downright <br/>
soggy in places, but NO RAIN!!! Happy Sunshine to all. 12 today all <br/>
together. Not as good as Music Woman, but we're still learnin'!!!-S. <br/>
S.Y. + T.D.<br/>
