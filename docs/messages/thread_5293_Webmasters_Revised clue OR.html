the City of Portland in Multnomah County, Oregon. This peaceful,<br/>
private garden is open to the public for strolling and quiet<br/>
contemplation. No rowdy sunbathers, frisbee players or picnic goers  are<br/>
welcome. The property is an historic residence designed by John Olmsted<br/>
in 1914, situated on thirteen acres overlooking the Willamette River.<br/>
When the original owner died in 1957, the property was donated to the<br/>
Episcopal Bishop with the proviso that it remain open to the public.<br/>
Its a wonderful place to enjoy a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
to the Trailhead:<br/>
&gt;From Portland take Macadam Ave. south towards Lake Oswego. Turn left on<br/>
Military Road, the fourth stoplight past the Sellwood Bridge. Take an<br/>
immediate right on Military Lane to the parking area for Elk Rock<br/>
Gardens at Bishops Close.<br/>
<br/>
to the Letterbox:<br/>
This letterbox listens to the sound of falling water and the rustle of<br/>
bamboo on a breezy day. When you find youself in the middle of a small<br/>
turnout looking at Box Leaf Honeysuckle, you can reach down and touch<br/>
the box with your right hand. Some branches may have to part but nothing<br/>
else needs to wander.<br/>
