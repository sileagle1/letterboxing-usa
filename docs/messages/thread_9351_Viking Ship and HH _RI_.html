 thanks for the update.  when I talked to Trish she said that the <br/>
 letterbox was still there, alive &amp; well.  I meant to take it off my

 got very scratched up and could not get close enough to the rock to <br/>

<br/>
I hope you aren't hurt by our "box bashing" of your letterbox.  I <br/>
couldn't help myself. Butterfly's comment brought back such memories <br/>
I couldn't help having a little fun at your box's expense.  I don't <br/>
mean anything mean or malicious by it.  I always appreciate and enjoy <br/>
the many boxes you put out in our area and your beautifully carved <br/>
stamps.  I hope you will accept my comments in the spirit as they <br/>
were intented.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
