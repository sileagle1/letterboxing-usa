                    <div class="plaintext-content">On March 17, 2002 Funhog placed the Prairie Dreams Letterbox near Denton,<br/>
Lancaster County, Nebraska. This box is hidden in a beautiful preserve that<br/>
protects over five hundred acres of virgin prairie, never having been<br/>
tilled by the hand of man. Come see what this country looked like to the<br/>
native people who lived here long before Columbus arrived.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: From Lincoln head South on Route 77 to the stoplight at<br/>
West Denton Road. Go west to SW 98th and then go left to the Spring Creek<br/>
Prairie Preserve. Park and check in at the office. <br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: walk clockwise around the pond until you are given the<br/>
choice of woods or water. Head for the trees but don't get corralled at the<br/>
Y. Instead, take the trail at 25 degrees magnetic. 0ver the river and<br/>
through the woods to a meadow you will go. Keeping trees on your left and<br/>
grass on your right continue uphill to a leaning fencepost reaching for a<br/>
young cedar. Walk left along the barbs until you see an orange rod in the<br/>
embrace of a fallen tree, home to this letterbox. This box is very<br/>
particular about how it comes and goes from its home: face down, bottoms up<br/>
will do the trick. If you continue on the main trail, you will complete a<br/>
loop back to your starting point.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On March 24, 2003 Funhog placed the Heartland Letterbox near Omaha,<br/>
Sarpy County, Nebraska. This box is a tribute to the small farms of<br/>
America's breadbasket, many of which have been swallowed up by huge<br/>
corporate agricultural ventures, housing developments and recreational<br/>
use. The rolling hills of eastern Nebraska are still home to these<br/>
vanishing family farms. This walk is about 2 miles roundtrip on a<br/>
paved path with no shade to be found until you reach the box.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: from exit #439 on I-80 go west about a half mile on<br/>
Highway 370. Just after you cross the bridge you will find the parking<br/>
lot for the Chalco Hills Recreation Area. Park on the right.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Shun the trolls. You are seeking a shady dell,<br/>
perfect for alfresco dining. As you approach this place, you will<br/>
receive an invitation to rest from a sturdy fellow on the left. Accept<br/>
his invitation and set your compass for 200 degrees magnetic.<br/>
Surrounded by The Magnificent Seven the letterbox is waiting,<br/>
sheltered beneath bark and sticks.<br/>
