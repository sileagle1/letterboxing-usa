                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>We had a very successful first day of letterboxing. We first went to Williamsburg, MA, and stamped two boxes on Petticoat Hill. Apparantly, some people had trouble with the first box, because we were third at the first box, and fifth at the second. Both boxes were in fine condition.
<br/>
<br/>We then went to Mt. Tom in Holyoke, MA and stamped Teabag Trail. Nice hike, but way too many mosquitos! Box was in excellent condition, and has seen a good amount of visitors. Make sure to get a map at the ranger's hut, there are lots of sites to see in this wonderful park that aren't on the way to the box.
<br/>
<br/>I can't believe it took us so long to discover this great hobby!
<br/>
<br/>Mike and Rachel
