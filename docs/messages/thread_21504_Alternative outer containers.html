looking into some of them to add to my collection. I'm certain a person<br/>
would right past them without knowing exactly what to look for.<br/>
<br/>
Which led me to my next train of thought, if you use one of these type of<br/>
boxes, should you tell the person in the clues so they don't tear up the<br/>
area looking for the box? I would hope that people would be respectful, but<br/>
I've seen the after math of boxers that did just that. <br/>

Subject: [LbNA] RE: New outer 'baggie' rule???<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a woodworker.  I'm intrigued by the idea of creating fanciful outer<br/>
boxes in lieu of that outer baggie -- a wooden box to contain a Rubbermaid<br/>
container.  As my wife (the other C) does the stamp carving, this gives me<br/>
an artistic outlet.<br/>
<br/>
Have others done this?  Has anyone tried painting a box with faux granite to<br/>
blend into a rock bank?  Or making an urban box that looks like a sprinkler<br/>
control or something similar?<br/>

Just remember to keep "public opinion" in mind when using <br/>
alternatives. In this day and age we must always consider that a non-<br/>
clear version of a letterbox could be (what we in public safety) <br/>
consider a "suspicious package".  I'd hate to have an urban letterbox <br/>
blown up because the authorities felt it too risky to open it!  <br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about the typical clear tupperware/rubbermaid/plastic <br/>
boxes is that you can see what is inside them. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH a good job using a fake rock, or hollowing out a slab of wood, <br/>
makes for a nice little tricky hiding spot!  <br/>

We quite often use camo duck tape around our rubbermaid boxes, and that's <br/>
always running thru my head.  In today's day and age, what if someone <br/>
accidentally finds it who "freaks out" over it and calls in the "authorities."  <br/>

<br/>
Last fall we did a totally word-of-mouth box where the box was hidden in an <br/>
old fire hydrant that they sometimes sell at auctions or give away, if they're <br/>
not going to be used anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we set it out in a forest preserve in a area where there wasn't exactly <br/>
any piped-in water *for* a fire hydrant.  The supervising staff knew about it <br/>
and was in on the joke.  Just as a joke they were interested in seeing how <br/>
long it would be before any of the employees stopped and said "hey, wait a <br/>
minute........"  We did it as a limited engagement box for the locals to see how <br/>
many people could get the stamp before the district employees discovered it was <br/>
there.  It lasted two full months with employees passing by it almost every <br/>
day.  A little bit into the third month, an employee finally did say "hey, wait a <br/>
minute....."<br/>
