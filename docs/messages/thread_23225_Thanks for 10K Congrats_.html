                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, after a beautiful spring weekend spent mostly on long-overdue <br/>
home, garden and yardwork (with just a little bit of letterboxing <br/>
thrown in on the way up to Boston for international folkdancing on <br/>
Saturday night!), I decided to stop by the library this evening to <br/>
see if there was any response to my report on reaching F10,000 a few <br/>
days back. WOW, did it ever warm my heart to see that nice outpouring <br/>
of congratulations from fellow letterboxers from all over the <br/>
country! I'm not going to have the time to answer all the individual <br/>
e-mails right now, but I did want to say how much it meant to me, and <br/>
I hope that some of you can make it over to our house this coming <br/>
weekend for our little 10K "celebration party". We have a very small <br/>
house, so I had only planned on having a few of our closer <br/>
letterboxing friends over for a little New England-style ham and <br/>
beans supper this coming Saturday around 6:30 PM. However, since <br/>
we're not the sort of people who could feel good about leaving out <br/>
anyone who might want to come, we'd like to extend the invitation <br/>
of "open house" to anyone who has wished us well over these last few <br/>
years of our letterboxing adventures, and who night like to get <br/>
our "home box" at the same time, since this would be one of those <br/>
rare occasions that we could actually be found at home! So many fine <br/>
people around the country have offered us not only the gift of the <br/>
letterboxes they place, but the gift of their frienship as well ... a <br/>
kind word of encouragement when things got rough, a glass of water <br/>
when we got thirsty, sometimes even an overnight stay with breakfast, <br/>
or dinner! We are so grateful for all these kindnesses along the way, <br/>
large and small, and welcome a chance to reciprocate. So, please, any <br/>
of our letterboxing friends who might wish to swing through our area <br/>
this weekend, please do stop by - you're all welcome! And, of course, <br/>
thank you all again for your graciousness and kindness!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
