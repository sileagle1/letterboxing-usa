I was very happy so many Marylanders came despite the long trip.  <br/>
<br/>
There were lots of new faces and several kids.  Pictures soon.<br/>
<br/>
Bethany came from Washington state. (Where they just say Washington, <br/>
always meaning the state, not D.C.  Hope I got her name right.) She <br/>
brought with her a half dozen traveling event stamps including the <br/>
infamous K-MARTha.  I also saw the wonderful LbNA U.S. map stamp.  <br/>
(more on these later)  Thanks so much for bringing them.<br/>
<br/>
With the freezing cold, and only one on-site letterbox, people stayed <br/>
and exchanged and socialized for a long time.  This was great.<br/>
<br/>
After hoping that a couple people would show up for the mystery <br/>
dinner that evening, almost 20 arrived.  Did anyone count?  There was <br/>
even a surprise mystery guest whose long name begins with L. Then <br/>
someone realized there was no mystery dinner stamp and 2 were quickly <br/>
carved at the table.  Too cool.  Of course, I still can't say where <br/>
the mystery dinner was. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Many, many thanks to Eileen of Celtic Pride for arriving early and <br/>
helping set up, and for the mystery location.  <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks for all the great event stamps.  That was a real surprise <br/>
for me and a delight to all.<br/>

Thanks for all for coming and sharing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Myriad kudos to Scarab and Night Owl for planning such a wonderful <br/>
gathering!!!  We cannot begin to express how much we thoroughly <br/>
enjoyed this event--it was such a blast!!!  From the wonderful event <br/>
stamps that so many folks carved (all bearing the symbol of the <br/>
Pentagon which has such a tremendous personal significance to our <br/>
family with whom I will certainly share these stamps), to the <br/>
incredibly friendly letterboxers who attended and welcomed us with <br/>
open arms, to the wonderful exchange of letterboxing trail stories to <br/>
the general camaraderie shared by a group of eclectic folks who all <br/>
bear such a strong passion for the hobby of letterboxing--the winter <br/>
icebreaker not only broke the ice but created some longlasting <br/>
friendships in the letterboxing brotherhood, to boot!  And to cap the <br/>
evening off with a mystery gathering at a great restaurant with a <br/>
mystery guest--who could ask for anything better than that???  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I want to thank all of the wonderful people who welcomed <br/>
my children with open arms--they were thrilled to death to be <br/>
surrounded by such loving and caring folks.  They both have not <br/>
stopped talking about their new found friends this evening (that is, <br/>
as long as they've been awake)!!!  Upon returning to the car from the <br/>
metro, both rnrB &amp; trkr instantly fell asleep with that 'had the best <br/>
day of their life' sort of look on their faces!!! Thanks for helping <br/>
me run them ragged throughout the day.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, all, for a wonderful time!  Scarab--thanks for all the <br/>
legwork in coordinating this event.  We will certainly cherish the <br/>
wonderful memories of this event for a lifetime!!!  If any of you <br/>
ever visit the other WA anytime in the future, do NOT hesitate to <br/>
drop us a note and we will give you the grand letterboxing tour of <br/>
the region &amp; a play to stay if need be!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see everyone along the letterboxing trail sometime soon,<br/>

Camping would be great. Greenbrier State Park in Hagerstown <br/>
(actually between Hagerstown and Frederick) has camping and <br/>
several boxes. We took the family at the end of June and had a <br/>
great time. May might be too cold?<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone be interested in this? A DC/MD/VA gather in MD?<br/>

gather)<br/>
