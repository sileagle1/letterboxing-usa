Could someone please explain what a hitchhiker box is?  We think we found one <br/>
this week while searching for another box (which we did find), are we suppose <br/>
to leave it there?  <br/>
Thank you greatly~<br/>

Hello Mommachick,<br/>
Welcome to the addiction. While there are a number of letterboxers <br/>
that will probably post an answer here on this list, I would rather <br/>
refer you to a number of great sites where you can find your <br/>
answers. I tend to be from the point of view that will "teach you to <br/>
fish, rather than give you fish"<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few sites you can check out and find most of the answers<br/>
to your questions.<br/>

Doug probably has the best info site on Hitch hikers<br/>
<br/>
AtlasQuest:<br/>
