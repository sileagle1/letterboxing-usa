Oceanview Letterbox<br/>
Norfolk, Va<br/>
Oceanview Park<br/>
Difficulty-- easy, but involves walking on sand.<br/>
<br/>
Our city has a great street<br/>
At both ends it sees water<br/>
Years ago, a trolley you might meet,<br/>
All these new cars are such a bother.<br/>
<br/>
This street passes several schools,<br/>
Including one that shares it's name<br/>
Runs North/South `twixt great tidal "pools", <br/>
Passes a hospital. Dunno yet? For shame!<br/>
<br/>
You want the north end<br/>
Where an old coaster met it's fate<br/>
Turn left at the last light, last bend,<br/>
Park up ahead on the right, just don't stay late.<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead, walk out on the beach<br/>
But mind you, stay off the dune grass.<br/>
Swimming and sunbathing, here it's a peach!<br/>
At the waterline you might find beach glass.<br/>
<br/>
Set off towards Hampton, on foot, of course.<br/>
Several stores you will pass<br/>
When you see grass good `nough for a horse,<br/>
At the first house, put on your shoes, (might be trash!)<br/>
<br/>
Locate the jetty, it goes out into the bay<br/>
Put your back to it, and walk to the hill.<br/>
Look `tween the `crete, it wont take all day.<br/>
Near a sad bush, find me, you will!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy my first letterbox!<br/>
This is a public access beach with a lifeguard on duty near the <br/>
parking area. Waves<br/>
are generally small. The park grounds are the remains of the Oceanview<br/>
Amusement Park which was closed in the `70's. Sit a spell, enjoy the <br/>
park and<br/>
beach! Nearby restaurants and hotels/motels.<br/>
