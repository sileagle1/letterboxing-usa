                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry to have to do this, but it has become necessary to change the <br/>
directions for the Ft Phoenix letterbox once again because of <br/>
changing conditions.  Therefore, The Yachtsman and I (Mary Manatee) <br/>
have moved the location of the Fort Phoenix Letterbox (#6 in the <br/>
Seaside Series 2) because of concerns about the safety of its former <br/>
spot in the winter months.  During one recent visit, the site was very <br/>
wet, although the box itself was fine.  The new spot should be <br/>
considerably drier during the winter months, although it <br/>
may be difficult to access during the summer because of the public <br/>
nature of the park.  <br/>
<br/>
The new directions are listed below.  <br/>
<br/>
Please replace the section that reads :<br/>
<br/>
	"Explore the fort and/or the hurricane barrier that extends <br/>
out into the harbor shared with New Bedford. Then proceed south <br/>
towards the water. Walk east on a path along the water until you reach <br/>
the end of the wall. Keep walking (towards the beach area) along a <br/>
sandy path (and/or the grass) until you see a very large, flat <br/>
boulder.<br/>
        Sit on this boulder. From here, Butler Flats Lighthouse bears <br/>
190 degrees, and a flagpole at the Fort bears 280 degrees; a prominent <br/>
smokestack across the harbor in New Bedford bears 236 degrees. Reach <br/>
down under the southeast corner of the large boulder and find your <br/>
reward. Please be careful at this site, as it is very heavily visited <br/>
in the good weather. "<br/>
<br/>
with the following section:<br/>
<br/>
	"Explore the fort, reading the different plaques that <br/>
commemorate various historical events in Fairhaven.  When you find the <br/>
plaque that commemorates the naval battle featuring Pope and Egery, <br/>
look down towards the East. Your reward is hidden under some leaves r <br/>
at the right hand end of the "gin-berry bush".  A flat <br/>
rock guards the entrance to the hiding place.  Please replace the box <br/>
carefully so that it cannot be seen from any angle, as this site is <br/>
heavily visited in all kinds of weather."<br/>

Maybe we'll try it again.<br/>
