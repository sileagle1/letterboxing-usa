2003 National Champions    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were so thrilled to see the women Huskies win the national championship game for the second year in a row, that we decided to place a box in their honor.<br/>
<br/>
Head to the home of the Women's Basketball National Champions, The University of Connecticut in Storrs. Begin your quest where these young women did, Gampel Pavilion. From the stadium, make your way north on Hillside Road. Cross over and travel down Glenbrook. Don't worry there isn't a penalty for traveling here! Cross N. Eagleville Road, and keep your eyes open for the stone house built with a stone from each of the 50 states. Fake out any curious players from the other team and break left rather than heading up the stairs. Spot the boulder under the pine. A couple of steps uphill will help you score the box, which is tucked safely under the right side. Stamp in and leave your congratulations for this young team of champions! <br/>
