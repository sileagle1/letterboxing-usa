                    <div class="plaintext-content">Floating Balloon nearly caused an airplane to crash at SeaTac, <br/>
narrowly avoiding the air intake that surely would have caused the <br/>
demise of the balloon as well as the plane.  But fortunately, that <br/>
didn't happen.<br/>
<br/>
Heard rumors it finally landed somewhere--wherever the wind whisked <br/>
it away--but who knows?  Perhaps it'll show up again someday.<br/>

PS. There wasn't any contact information in this hitchhiker.  It's <br/>
rare enough to actually hear back about a hitchhiker, but it's even <br/>
more rare if you don't leave contact information in them!  <br/>
