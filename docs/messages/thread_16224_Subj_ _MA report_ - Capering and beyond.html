Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
Binx and I spent a wonderful fall weekend on Cape Cod...our first <br/>
time boxing there and my first time on the Cape since riding the <br/>
CCRT as a teenager (25 miles seemed so LONG back then! ;)).<br/>
<br/>
First, our thanks to Mary Manatee and the Yachtsman for organizing a <br/>
great gathering. Despite the park's reluctance to let us use a <br/>
pavillion, the letterboxing spirit prevailed in the shape of two <br/>
screenhouses connected by a roof of blue tarp, nicely shielding the <br/>
group from the late afternoon downpours that eventually arrived. It <br/>
was truly yankee ingenuity at it's best! The day-only stamp <br/>
series/story was a lot of fun and the stamps were very cute (I hit <br/>
F300 along the way!), especially "Relief". The event stamp was very <br/>
nicely done as well.<br/>
<br/>
Nickerson State Park (Area 7) was a wonderful place to camp (unless <br/>
50 cub scouts are running wild at 7:30am on Sunday morning!). Make <br/>
sure you make reservations well in advance because it is apparently <br/>
going "all-reservable" next year. I think there were four sites of <br/>
boxers camped out in our area. It was great to see old friends and <br/>
meet new faces. We had a great after-gathering dinner and brew at <br/>
Laurino's (sp?) with Mary, Dave, Tweety, Mr.Coon, Curious Crane, <br/>
Latte Man, and of course TeamGreenDragon. I wonder what the <br/>
clientele thought of our conversations...? Anyways, there was great <br/>
pizza and more flamingos than you can shake a stick at. Great seeing <br/>
you all!<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, the torrential rain was only passing through and was gone <br/>
by bedtime. On Sunday we awoke to a beautiful clear fall day (and <br/>
the aforementioned screaming cub scouts). After breakfast, camp tear-<br/>
down, and final see-yous to the other boxers, we headed out to <br/>
explore the local boxing scene. We nabbed boxes in Brewster, <br/>
Orleans, Eastham, Chatham, and Harwich as well as picking up the <br/>
Gulliver's Traveler's HH at Three Sisters Light. (It was just <br/>
planted that day. We think we met the placers on their way out but <br/>
missed our chance to think of a clever way to question them <br/>
discreetly). Thanks to all placers! We loved being on the shore <br/>
again...too bad it was too cold to swim. I was thinking how amazing <br/>
it is that we (modern-day folk) can go exploring the Adirondack <br/>
mountains one weekend and be strolling on outer Cape Cod the next. <br/>
The adventures that are available to us are easy to take for granted.<br/>
<br/>
I'm definitely spoiled now that I've seen the Cape in the off-<br/>
season, when it was relatively easy to get around and find parking. <br/>
I've heard the nightmarish stories of traffic jams and general <br/>
craziness and I don't really want to experience that in the warm <br/>
months. Guess we'll have to plan to tour most of the area by bike! <br/>
Anyhow, thanks again to all who organized and attended the Caper!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails,<br/>
<br/>
