                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, once again I ventured out today on the Narragansett Trail. This time,<br/>
I decided to take my girlfriend's dog with me. His name is Simba. He is a<br/>
Yello Lab. He is fun to say the least and very useful in following the<br/>
correct trail back home when it becomes hard to see. Must be that doggy<br/>
nose or the eyesight. At any rate, High and Bullet ledges beckoned to me<br/>
today. I'm sorry, I didn't have enough daylight to place the three others<br/>
on the trail. We will do that on Saturday when we catch the new and<br/>
improved Little Dam series. <br/>
So, just as I topped the ridge just before High Ledge with Simba leading me<br/>
by about 50 feet, i see movement in the woods. There below the ridge to the<br/>
right were a flock of at least 20 turkeys. Of course Simba saw them before<br/>
I did. I said "don't you dare" but he ignored me and proceeded to chase<br/>
some turkeys. It was fun to watch and needless to say, he didn't catch any.<br/>
I don't think he was trying anyway. It was just something to chase. I<br/>
thought to myself, "i'll bet there is a hunter nearby".<br/>
Sure enough, as I was stamping into the High Ledge letterbox, I heard Simba<br/>
let out a guarding WOOF. It was the hunter clad in blaze orange. I yelled<br/>
out SORRY ABOUT THAT... he kinda waved at me infrustration. Didn't hear any<br/>
shots after that. I think Simba chased away his catch. <br/>
Oh, and by the way, there IS another letterbox up by High Ledge. It is<br/>
called Ledge Woods. The clue can be found at Eastern Mountain Sports in the<br/>
Crystal Mall in Waterford, CT. You'd be surprise at what you'd find up<br/>
there.<br/>
