Its more fun to use a unique stamp ... think of it as a signature<br/>
or calling card<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2.  Once you've placed a box to you regularly go and check on it?  <br/>
<br/>
No, but many people do.  I think this is personal preference.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If the person who finds the box happens to be the one to finish <br/>

<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do an easy clue or do one with some friends or family.  It might<br/>
also help to read the faq or getting started page on the lbna website.<br/>

I'm glad to see I am not the only newbie.  I was going to ask a <br/>
similar question.  Is is ok to use a stamp that is not hand-carved at <br/>
first until you find a design and get something more personal made or <br/>
is it reaaly bad to change your stamp?  <br/>
<br/>
Also I saw someone's stamp in a geocaching logbook.  It was a cute <br/>
design with a number underneath it.  What was the number?  I thought <br/>
it might be the number of boxes placed/found at first but that would <br/>
change all the time and not be good on a permanent stamp. <br/>
<br/>
We found a letterbox by accident recently but some people came along <br/>
so we hid it again without having time to take a look at the stamps.  <br/>
