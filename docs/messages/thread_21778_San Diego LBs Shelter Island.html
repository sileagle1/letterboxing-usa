We found this box last Jan (04) and must admit it was in a very <br/>
devious location! Shortly thereafter the clues were removed from the <br/>
LBNA site (along with the Old Town San Diego box). We had confirmed <br/>
that box #1 was indeed missing, but box #2 was definitely alive and <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Did any ever actually confirm that box #2 (Shelter Island) was/is <br/>
indeed missomg?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious, as this was a great box/location to find.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Thanks, I removed the clues after the box was replaced for the second <br/>
time (high mortality rate) and subsequently confirmed missing.  I keep <br/>
toying with the idea of replacing it but I don't get to San Diego as <br/>
often as I used to so.<br/>
