Thanks for calling my attention to the article.  I gave the writer <br/>
the lead for the last teacher she interviewed, Andrew, who was <br/>
running the Quest program for at risk teens in northern NJ.  He was <br/>
very happy for the chance at some publicity since the program was <br/>
discontinued this year due to lack of funds.  <br/>
