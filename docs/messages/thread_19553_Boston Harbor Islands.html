We camped on Grape Island for my son's birthday party with our extended family two years ago and had a blast! Except for the skunks who decided to join us! How do skunks get to the island? Do they have boats? hehehe<br/>

I've been meaning to get back there to plant a LB but haven't carved the stamp yet. Hmmm...I think I'll get started! <br/>

There were no skunks on the Island prior to the building of the Jamestown Bridge in 1940.<br/>
Then the toll collectors thought it a neat thing to feed the little critters - so cute!!! And over the bridge they went.<br/>
