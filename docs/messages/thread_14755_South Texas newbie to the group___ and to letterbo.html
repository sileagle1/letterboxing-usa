                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to have another Texas Letterboxer!  When I started almost<br/>
a year ago there were less than 15 boxes in Texas.  Now there<br/>
are over 100, but most have been placed by myself and Baby Bear<br/>
so we need new boxers!<br/>
I have 2 boxes that I prepared several months ago destined for<br/>
the Corpus Christi area but have not had a chance to get down<br/>
that way.  Maybe in the fall.  Hope to look for some of your<br/>
future boxes down that way then.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the welcome, Silver Eagle! While Texas - especially South <br/>
Texas is still sparcely populated with letterboxes, I can see from <br/>
what you said that it has grown considerably. <br/>
<br/>
My grandson and I have only gone out letterboxing once, although I <br/>
plan to try to find all 6? letterboxes that are placed within an <br/>
hour's drive in four different directions from our home. It has been <br/>
SO hot, though! While yesterday was 'only' 98*', the day before was <br/>
113* and the day before that was 115*! It really is too hot to be <br/>
outside for long. I am kind of trying to hold off the letterboxing <br/>
trips until our granddaughter returns home from her visits with <br/>
other relatives, so she can join me too. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I was surprised that there were none placed in Corpus Christi <br/>
already. Eventually, I will get some planted there as well. But for <br/>
now, I have planted 6, mostly in Bee County. I haven't posted the <br/>
clues yet, because this is so far from any other letterboxers that I <br/>
thought I'd wait until I got all of the ones I have planned for the <br/>
immediate future out there. I have several (about 6 more) planned <br/>
for San Patricio County, and at least one for Kenedy? County too. <br/>
I'd like to have them all in place before I post the clues, so there <br/>
will be a 'trail' of letterboxes to find... depending on how far <br/>
anyone wants to drive north. Some will be series stamps too. This <br/>
should be within a week or two.<br/>
