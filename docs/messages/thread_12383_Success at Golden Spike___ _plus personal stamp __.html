                    <div class="plaintext-content">After a previous attempt where I nearly stepped on a rattlesnake, and some<br/>
encouragement from A-bear, I went back to Golden Spike (Promontory, UT),<br/>
tried again, and I'm happy to report the box is alive and well!  I'm also<br/>
glad to report no snake bites although every rustling of the grass made me<br/>
jump a bit.  This was the first box that I have found in my month of looking<br/>
with other stamps in it.<br/>
<br/>
It was so fun to see other people's stamps finally!  I even recognized<br/>
several names that I have heard here on the list (like Paisleyorca and<br/>
A-bear).  Let me ask you all something, I have been hearing you commenting<br/>
on seeing the personal stamps in a file section, but I can't figure out<br/>
where you mean.  Is this something on the main web page?  I would love to<br/>
see some other stamps as there aren't many doing this here yet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. <br/>
