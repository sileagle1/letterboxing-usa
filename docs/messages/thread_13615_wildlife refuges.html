the staff of the refuge.<br/>
<br/>
Discuss letterboxing with them and the desire to place a box in a low <br/>
impact fashion.<br/>
<br/>
Emphasize that the goal is to get people to come and enjoy the <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of a NWR you need to be sure that the area you use is not <br/>
part of a fragile site that supports nesting in breeding season.  At <br/>
those times the access might be restricted.  Remember too that there <br/>
is often an open hunting season on NWR's and you need to take care in <br/>
planting.<br/>
<br/>
The staff can guide you in choices.<br/>

Contact them and ask.  I would guess that this will be frowned upon as you <br/>
don't want people traipsing willy-nilly through protected or fragile habitat, <br/>
but you may be able to figure something out, like a series of questions that can <br/>
only be answered after going through a section that elicits the box at a <br/>
nature center or ranger station or something like that.  They probably won't want <br/>
boxes off the path or anywhere near wildlife.<br/>
