                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not even this snow but the previous fall on the eve of Thanksgiving <br/>
and in the category of "boys will  be Boys "the cowboy and his cousin <br/>
had a great snowball fight at our farm.  Of course like sword duels <br/>
the fight went up and down hill around vehicles and then fatefully <br/>
out onto the loading dock where the Cowboy lost his footing in the <br/>
snow and ice and fell  8 feet. He army crawled to the top and  the <br/>
fight resumed from knees the balls flew until the older cousin gave <br/>
in. With victory in hand he limped off to find the older sister and <br/>
get a ride home. Now the Cowboy awaits a MRI to get a better look at <br/>
a chip in the ankle bone....HMMM. So Mom has become an attendent to <br/>
the one on crutches a system he is most in favor of!  I have been <br/>
spending down time carving , look for my Town Gazebo coming soon.  <br/>
This slowed me but I've done 2 seasons in the snow. Its no big deal <br/>
even the Bic pens worked under a foot of snow and ice! Once in awhile <br/>
a clue is covered up or a box is frozen in - Oh well . Ink pads <br/>
slipped into an inner pocket work fine after just a minute in the <br/>
body warmth. Oh how I missed getting out this week but maybe a little <br/>
over the weekend.   Leader of the Pack <br/>
