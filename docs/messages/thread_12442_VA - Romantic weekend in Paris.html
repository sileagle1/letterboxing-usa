found six boxes in and around Paris!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday was a little rainy so we decided to go wine tasting.  There are <br/>
several vineyards just outside the DC burbs -- it's a whole other world less <br/>
than 50 minutes away!<br/>
<br/>
We sample several of the whites and reds at the Shenandoah vineyards <br/>
(selecting a few bottles to take home) and were rewarded with Newbei's VA <br/>
wine trail series #1 (are there subsequent ones?  We didn't see them).  Only <br/>
a couple of people have stamped in.  It's a shame because it is a fun way to <br/>
spend a rainy day (just make sure you eat something first -- those country <br/>
lanes seemed a little windier on the way out than in...)<br/>
<br/>
Sunday was balmy and sunny and we headed to Sky Meadow Park to work off the <br/>
multi-course dinners and breakfasts we'd been enjoying.  Yes, Sunday was an <br/>
A Darned Good ADG day!  We found five ADG boxes, including the three from <br/>
the Sarah Special and the Paris mystery box (sneakily we found it without <br/>
having to go all the way down the mountain and back up the other side!)  The <br/>
stamps were all beautiful and we loved the wooden apple shaped backings!  <br/>
Just a couple of small notes -- when Sarah says, "turn around and look at <br/>
how far you've come" -- do it!  Or else, you'll follow her next clue looking <br/>
in the totally opposite direction and find yourself poking around a lot of <br/>
wrong stones and trees getting hot and bothered.  The "right" grouping of <br/>
stones and trees is obvious if you are looking in the "right" direction <br/>
{just don't sit on the gross little wormies all over the rocks :)...}  We <br/>
learned a good lesson while looking for the mystery box:  most boxes are not <br/>
too far off the trail because people are trying not to disturb the area.  <br/>
Whenever I started looking too far off the trail -- I knew we had to be <br/>
wrong, trying to hard to get the clues to fit our location rather than <br/>
looking for the right spot that made sense.  P.S.  The next person to find <br/>
the mystery box may find a surprise inside -- no, not a HH -- but our pastel <br/>
rainbow colored stamp pad --  I think Da, in all his excitement, put our <br/>
stamp back in the box rather than in the backpack -- ooops!<br/>
<br/>
On our way back home, through more beautiful horse and wine country, we <br/>
stopped at one more ADG box --"let's have a picnic".  We saw that D and Shoe <br/>
had been there during the cold and rainy winter.  Luckily for us, it was a <br/>
beautiful Spring day.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks newbe and ADG for all the wonderful boxes!<br/>
<br/>
You all in the DC area should consider heading out to Paris to look for all <br/>
these boxes, sip some wine, hike in the mountains.  It is less than an hour <br/>
away but a true bit of the country!<br/>
