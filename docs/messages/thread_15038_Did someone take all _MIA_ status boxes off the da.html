                    <div class="plaintext-content">I posted a box as "possibly" MIA earlier this week -- noticed today <br/>
that my entry is gone ... and have noticed that aslmot every other <br/>
entry is "good" or "found" --- didn't see any other MIA's... <br/>
<br/>
FYI -- I *did* contact the placer before posting about the POSSIBLE <br/>
MIA box... have not heard peep from the placer, and since we're new <br/>
to letterboxing and compass-yeilding, is why I put three question <br/>
marks behind the MIA part -- because we're not SURE, but couldn't <br/>
figure out anywhere else it could have been.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of the database, if someone wants to use it... and I <br/>
don't mind reporting my finds there -- thought that was the prudent <br/>
thing to do, since 2 days after I started visiting this site, a whole <br/>
hub-bub of negative started about someone posting 'SitReps'... so <br/>
instead of posting about our fun adventure, I just put it on the <br/>
database &amp; kept my mouth shut here... <br/>
<br/>
what am I supposed to do?  I dont' get it... should I post about our <br/>
adventure HERE on the list &amp; let everyone know about whether or not <br/>
we found boxes, or should I post it on the database?  or should I not <br/>
post at ALL??? From all the negative since I started coming here, I <br/>
can't figure out what is appropriate &amp; what's NOT... from "sit reps" <br/>
to posting on the database, to asking a "newbie" question such as <br/>
where do i get materials to carve my stamps????? (finally figured out <br/>
that one on my own thanks to a nice local letterboxer that was <br/>
willing to exchange local store information via email -- she also <br/>
happens to be the owner of the "MIA" box mentioned above) ... <br/>
<br/>
we were SO excited about letterboxing when we found out about it... <br/>
thought it would be fun to go to an event, and meet a bunch of <br/>
people, or how fun it would be to run into other letterboxers on a <br/>
trail... but after all this negativity, we'll probably just keep to <br/>
ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
just some insight from an "outsider" looking in... <br/>
