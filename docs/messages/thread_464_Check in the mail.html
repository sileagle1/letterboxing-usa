A check came in the mail from you.  That was very nice of you.<br/>
I was not seeking compensation for the jars I sent out.  I did<br/>

appreciate it nonetheless.  Thank you very much.<br/>

You two must travel a lot to be hitting all the states you have<br/>

Hi Dan,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to respond so late but we have been a bit busy.<br/>
<br/>
My dear wife Ginny comes from  a HUGE family of nine siblings scattered in<br/>
the midwest.  So that way I think we can Y2K those states.   With the family<br/>
arrangement we prob won't be orphaning any boxes unless we go to other<br/>
states to achieve the group's goal.  Additionally, we both work for American<br/>
Airlines and can reach out and touch some states very economically if you<br/>
all need us to get the job done.<br/>
<br/>
I am happy you have accepted our donation for suppling  the tools for our<br/>
trade.  We feel you shouldn't be out of  pocket for our concern.  I think<br/>
you do enough already for our group and there is no price I feel can be<br/>
placed on the dedication you have shown.  So T H A N K  Y O U very much!<br/>
Besides we want to take care of our supplier!<br/>
<br/>
Food for thought...My dad is a ol plow boy from the farm...he always<br/>
encourages me to, " Take a chance, Columbus did....lost only one<br/>
ship....Santa Maria."<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Greg<br/>

Hi Randy,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the information about which states will be covered.  We will be<br/>
glad to pickup Louisana sometime this summer.  Another of Ginny's sisters<br/>
lives there.  We might shoot down to Atlanta for Six Flags over Georgia with<br/>
the kids, so that can be done also.<br/>
<br/>
I think we should count non-internet states.  How can we bring these to the<br/>
surface?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Greg<br/>

I may be going on a little camping trip to ME this summer.  If I do, I've got ME covered, and may even be able to put RI &amp; CT on the web too.  What's with NY?  Do we have a box there or not?<br/>

&gt;work out this time. I WILL have it done by Y2K, tho, for sure. May bein June <br/>
&gt;or July, or October. And I prolly have a few friends I can "volunteer" to do <br/>
&gt;the Ga. box. At least I'll try. <br/>

<br/>
I would have planted the Greensboro NC box this past weekend<br/>
but it was raining (OK it wasn't raining on Saturday but the<br/>
park was too wet to plant it - IMO)  Hopefully I can get that<br/>
done soon.  Now, will this be the first or second box in NC<br/>
considering the one that starts in TN and ends in NC?<br/>

    Don't feel you have to stand aside for me to place the first<br/>
letterbox in Washington State.  Although i have carved my first stamp<br/>
(pathetic as it is) Friday nite, i have no qualms about other boxes<br/>
being placed here first.  Heck it will give me one to look for.  Just<br/>
don't make the clues too hard for an out-of-shape-compass-moron.  I'm<br/>
hoping you will be able to place your Washington box on this  (the East)<br/>
side of the Cascades.  Not that i'm prejudiced against the<br/>
elbow-to-elbow-slug-infested-cell-phone-addicted-water-bottle-sucking-suv-driving-<br/>
wet-side-latte-fiends.  Its more that i just don't go there unless under<br/>
duress.  Besides, i hear they kill whales over there..... not that i'd<br/>
be mistaken for one (i'd wear bright colors).   Anyway, thanks for your<br/>
efforts.  I look forward to collecting your stamp.           jim<br/>

Greg (the Jonny Appleseed of letterboxes):<br/>
    Don't feel you have to stand aside for me to place the first<br/>
letterbox in Washington State.  Although i have carved my first stamp<br/>
(pathetic as it is) Friday nite, i have no qualms about other boxes<br/>
being placed here first.  Heck it will give me one to look for.  Just<br/>
don't make the clues too hard for an out-of-shape-compass-moron.  I'm<br/>
hoping you will be able to place your Washington box on this  (the East)<br/>
side of the Cascades.  Not that i'm prejudiced against the<br/>
elbow-to-elbow-slug-infested-cell-phone-addicted-water-bottle-sucking-suv-dr<br/>
iving-<br/>
wet-side-latte-fiends.  Its more that i just don't go there unless under<br/>
duress.  Besides, i hear they kill whales over there..... not that i'd<br/>
be mistaken for one (i'd wear bright colors).   Anyway, thanks for your<br/>
efforts.  I look forward to collecting your stamp.           jim<br/>

&gt;  I think we should count non-internet states.  How can we bring these<br/>

<br/>
I would think the easiest way would be to get the information from those<br/>
you know who do not have internet access.  Exactly how to do that I'm<br/>
not sure.  I remember some people from Connecticut last year who had<br/>
some boxes at (pubs?).  Somebody with a Juno account (i think) told me<br/>
about it.  I'd have to dig through my old emails to get the details.  Of<br/>
course you'd need their permission to publish.  BTW, I think its OK if<br/>
small businesses are doing this as I don't think they're looking for<br/>
this for ad value.  I am not bothered about Hospers Furniture or the<br/>
Rock Creek Tavern or such places having a letterbox anymore than if a<br/>
library has one.  I mean it would be entirely different if their clues<br/>
read "Get your free wash with a $10.00 fill up!"<br/>
<br/>
A couple of other thoughts:<br/>
I don't think 50 by Y2K was an effort to corner the market on<br/>
letterboxing.  I think it meant there's one (at least) in every state at<br/>
the Letterboxing USA site which is simply a shared resource.  But<br/>
there's plenty of room for non-internet subscribed people whether they<br/>
use the service or not.  I think its generous to offer though (at least<br/>
a space) for them to publish if that's what they want to do.  Is this<br/>
what other<br/>
people think?<br/>

Hi Jim,<br/>
<br/>
Hey carving that first stamp makes one know why we'd never make through<br/>
medical school!  Congrats though on completing the challenge and that first<br/>
slice.  Ginny and I learned alot on that first one.  I think each one you<br/>
will learn something about it and about yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I didn't get back with you but I have been busier than a one legged<br/>
man in an ass kicking contest.<br/>
<br/>
Jim, I just wanted you  to know that we all would be honored for you to<br/>
place that first (as far as we know the first in WA, some historian someday<br/>
will dispute all states when where and by whom ? I'm sure) letterbox in<br/>
Washington, your home state.  Ginny's and my thinking is that we want to<br/>
help the rest of the group achieve the Y2k goal due to the fact that we are<br/>
mobile.  We don't really want to orphan the boxes we scatter thoughout the<br/>
states (if we place to achieve Y2k goals) and would rather not place boxes<br/>
if someone from that state could do it and get something special out of it.<br/>
It would thrill us most to get your stamp in our personal books and know it<br/>
was the first placement in WA.  You are not taking anything from us here but<br/>
here's a big THANK YOU  for coming on board.  Gosh, we got a real kick out<br/>
of planting the first Missouri box without the marching band and parade!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the :) in the above writing.<br/>
<br/>
Just some insight on our plans for WA.  My family here are a little<br/>
outdoorsy people and we like to rough it in hiking and camping.  My son Kyle<br/>
(13) wants to climb Mt. St. Helens again.  We last did it 3 years ago.  I<br/>
want to plant about 3 stamps there minimum to make it attractive to make the<br/>
trip for and also prove thru stamping the summit (whats left of it) was<br/>
reached.  We plan to keep doing the tough stuff as long as our bodies permit<br/>
and give something back to the young folks who will follow our footsteps to<br/>
some of these beautiful adventures.   As we getting weaker and a little<br/>
shorter of breath we will make trips just to collect other's stamps.<br/>
<br/>
We traveled to Kelowa, BC last fall and loved it.  We will return and place<br/>
some there too for searchers.  I will try to get some friends interest there<br/>
and maybe it will grow.  I did drive thru the Northern Cascades 2 years ago<br/>
from SEA and absolutely loved it.  Where do you live exactly?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the flattery,<br/>
<br/>
Regards, Greg<br/>

Hey don't knock the Chi-tea Latte at Barnes and Noble unless you've tried<br/>
one.  I owe that one to my very beautiful and gifted friend in Kelowna, BC.<br/>
It isn't called B and N up there though.  Can,t remember what it is called<br/>
in the N.W........Johnny Appleseed<br/>

&lt;&lt; Ya'll didn't mention the west, but I'm trying to figure a way to coerce my<br/>
 brother or sisterin-law into helping me place a permanent box in Utah soon.<br/>
 There were 5 temporary ones there just last July!  It could happen...and<br/>
 ya'll will be the first to know!<br/>

It kind of looks like I may be going to Utah this August for about a week or <br/>
so.  Will be flying into Salt Lake city and camping at Lake Powell.  I've <br/>
never been out there but my friend has, so I don;t know the area.  But if any <br/>
letterboxes will be or are placed out there, I would like to try to find them.<br/>

LOL!!!!  . . . I didn't think of that. . . I guess I could get some boxes <br/>
together and place them along the way.  ummm. . . maybe they could all have <br/>
the same theme stamp!  Becky's first cross country letterboxing trip!<br/>
