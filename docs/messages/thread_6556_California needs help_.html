Be careful what you wish for!  The webmeisters are already at risk <br/>
for a hernia.<br/>
Instead, check out the 'boxing scene over in Santa Barbara &amp; San Luis <br/>
Obispo Counties.  Lots of good stuff there.  My own Stonehen has yet <br/>
to be conquered.  I expect the 1st person to salt the bird's tail <br/>
will be generously rewarded.<br/>
