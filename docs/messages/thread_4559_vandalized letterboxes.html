Hey thanks for the heads up on the Pawcatanuck Jaunt!<br/>
That was one of the first letterboxes that I found and<br/>
I'm sure the author ( I think it was Jay Drew )will be<br/>
more than willing to help repair/replace it unless you<br/>
have done so already. Does it still need to be fixed<br/>
up?  Let us all know. Thanks!<br/>
