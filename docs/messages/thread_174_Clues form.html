                        From: <strong>Daniel Servatius (elf@pclink.com)</strong> | 
                        Date: 1999-01-18 22:38:37 UTC-06:00
                    </div>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">To All:<br/>
<br/>
Here is the consensus on the clues form we discussed a while back.<br/>
5 or 6 people did respond and gave input.  Simplicity is what's<br/>
most desired.  One person expressed an interest in selecting fonts<br/>
and color, but for the most part people just want it to be plain<br/>
and simple.<br/>
<br/>
You can find a simple sample form here:<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/testform.htm<br/>
<br/>
This represents the gist of how it would work.  I believe with <br/>
modern email programs this form can be sent to someone by email.<br/>
Or else it may just be referenced as a web page.  Either way, once<br/>
you have the form up on your screen you would just fill it out<br/>
and then click on the Publish button at bottom.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not quite sure yet how the mapping will work.  I think if you <br/>
type the nearest city and state in as the location that will be<br/>
enough information to programmatically bring up a map on your <br/>
finished page. <br/>
<br/>
With this system the page will come up pre-formatted.  You will<br/>
not have the ability to customize the layout, colors, etc.  That<br/>
is the drawback of having a simple form.  But for those of you<br/>
who are interested there are other tools available that may be<br/>
used for customization.  You would have to let me know so I can<br/>
tell you where to get these tools, show you how to use them,<br/>
force you to read a disclaimer and then give you access to the<br/>
server.  Sound complicated?  So-so.<br/>
<br/>
My desire, if it is possible, after publishing the information,<br/>
would be for the program to take you to the finished page so you<br/>
can view it and determine if its what you want.  If not, you could<br/>
then go back to the form to make additional edits.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind that this will probably not go into effect for a<br/>
while.  I will need help in the design and implementation long<br/>
before this can be used.  And there are (yuk!) legal issues to<br/>
be considered as well.  I think the header of this form will<br/>
have to be a disclaimer similar to our other one, this time<br/>
geared toward the provider of clues and the publisher.  Or else<br/>
we would have a link something like this on the form: "Before<br/>
submitting your clues read the waiver of responsibility and<br/>
disclaimer for clues writers and publishers."  The link would <br/>
then take you to the actual disclaimer.  That's how the disclaimer<br/>
on our clues pages works and it seems to suffice.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your input.  Its very much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
-Dan<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  The items on this form can be changed.  It is just a sample<br/>
to show what a simple form looks like.  We can go through as many iterations as<br/>
necessary to determine what the final form will look<br/>
like and even how it will function.  But that may not be for a few months.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; That's a good point to bring up Steve.  I wonder if there should be a<br/>
&gt; separate button off<br/>
<br/>
&gt; to the side that would let you work with maps (or the Tiger Map<br/>
&gt; Surfer).  The location<br/>
<br/>
can mean a map center (whether its a lat./long. or  a city) or it can<br/>
just mean where you<br/>
drive to to start out your hunt.<br/>
<br/>
I think with a little programming I can make the system interpret if it<br/>
is a Lat./long. or a<br/>
city name.  That way you could enter either value into the same field.<br/>
That way the form<br/>
could still remain simple.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If anyone else has any thoughts please jump in.<br/>

Hey, Dan!<br/>
First off, let me say the sample form looks great and would be a wonderful way<br/>
to get the data where it needs to be.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the city name vs. coordinates issue, I can see reasons for having<br/>
both inputs.  Then I can list the nearest city, and (in case you can't figure<br/>
out where in the heck Glade, Kansas is) also have the option of inputing the<br/>
lat. &amp; long.<br/>
<br/>
Is this overkill?<br/>
<br/>
Also, perhaps the form could ask for some specific comments, such as<br/>
Difficulty Rating?<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the good work,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

  No, I don't think its overkill.  I'm just wondering if it should be part of<br/>
<br/>
  a separate function for mapping.  The form would be for the basic information<br/>
<br/>
  and we could perhaps have a button off to the side for maps &amp; lat./long.<br/>

  Yes, I think other people have wanted that too.  What should it say?<br/>
<br/>
  It could just be a blank field like the rest.<br/>
<br/>
  Really, I think people could put in there "Cake walk, Easy, Medium, Hard,<br/>

  Extra Hard, Treacherous, Don't go here unless your a fool, Etc."<br/>
<br/>
  How does that sound?<br/>

You could either have a blank where they could input whatever they wanted, or<br/>
you could standardize a bit more by providing radio buttons where they select<br/>
either Easy, Moderate, Difficult, or Very Difficult (or something like that)<br/>
for each of two categories: Terrain and Clues.  Such a form might not be as<br/>
clean and simple to look at as one with blank spaces, but might be easier to<br/>
fill out.  For me, a blank space can be intimidating when I'm not sure how to<br/>
fill it.  It's easier just to click the button that applies.  (This is how I<br/>
handled the membership form for my own website at<br/>
http://members.aol.com/catsdice )<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Erik that it would be a nice option to be able to attach stamp<br/>
images.  His idea about being able to designate when several boxes belong to a<br/>
series deserves consideration, as well.<br/>
<br/>
Dan, thanks for your continuing efforts to take everyone's ideas into account.<br/>

I think the form looks great and makes a fine starting point.  I'm<br/>
trying to visualize how we can get a simple form that yields pages as<br/>
nice as those you and others have done.  A couple of additional ideas:<br/>
<br/>
Could there be a place to name an attached gif file for a stamp image?<br/>
Perhaps someone (far more clever than I) could set it up so that the<br/>
attached gif file would automatically end up, say, centered, between the<br/>
letterbox name and the clue, or something similar.<br/>
<br/>
I think having access to the maps would be really neat if it can be made<br/>
to work. The Tiger map server IS cumbersome (slowwwwww), but amazingly<br/>
accurate, especially for less-rural areas.<br/>
<br/>
And, I really think that a form field for related series of boxes would<br/>
be a good feature - helps a searcher locate many in proximity to each<br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
Nice work, Dan'l.<br/>

I'm inclined to stay away from boxes, checkboxes, pull-down lists, etc.<br/>
I think it may distract from the simplicity and the flexibility.  But a<br/>

putting<br/>
a button off to the side for selecting a map?  It seems to me that for<br/>
multiple<br/>
boxes in one location you will have one map that is used for all of<br/>
them.<br/>
Perhaps then when adding a box to a series you would select the map at<br/>
the<br/>
same time.  Or at least you would know a predetermined location that<br/>
already<br/>
has a clue and/or map.  I'm just thinking out loud here...  What would<br/>
you do<br/>
to recognize that it is a series you are potentailly interested in<br/>
adding to?<br/>
If there exists a series already how would you know?  If there doesn't<br/>
exist<br/>
a series and you want there to be one how would you initiate it?<br/>
I'm not trying to make things complicated.  I'm just trying to determine<br/>
what<br/>
this will look like and how it will work in order to keep it simple and<br/>
usable<br/>
for an average person.  Maybe there should just be a question you are<br/>
asked<br/>
after you click publish: "Is this letterbox part of a series?"<br/>
Make comments please.<br/>

&gt; What would that look like and what is supposed to happen when you put<br/>
&gt; in the name of your image and click Publish?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
Well, the answer is better coming from a programmer, as I imtimated when<br/>
I brought this up. Looking at the process from the outside,<br/>
non-programmer's point of view, here was my assumption:<br/>
<br/>
Someplace on the form is a field, which says:<br/>
	 "If you have a gif-format image file to send, fill in the file name<br/>
here:" <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, it could be made to work like the attachment option on a<br/>
browser and somehow tag the file along with the form info when you<br/>
"publish", i.e., send the form data as an e-mail to the Letterbox<br/>
server.<br/>
Hopefully further, the same programming exercise that enables the<br/>
server's program to extract the info in the form fields and convert it<br/>
into a nifty graphic page layout can also see the field that has a file<br/>
name in it, and place the named file within the HTML codes so that the<br/>
image appears. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, and this speaks also to the "series" comment - I'm really<br/>
happy with the look of the "Appalachian Trail" page of letterboxes (VT).<br/>
Now, I think someone else ( or I) might likely want to add a box in the<br/>
vicinity. If so, can the state map go from (2) to (3) automatically? The<br/>
series" box would tell the program where to put it. <br/>
<br/>
I realize I'm rehashing stuff I already said,  with precoious little new<br/>
stuff said - in that regard, it sounds an awful lot like the main news<br/>
item these days, so I'll shut up for now. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, thanks for taking the lead here, Dan'l.<br/>

I've been kind of waiting on this response because it was a little deep.<br/>
But tonight I was on my way back home on my bike (yes, I'm an intrepid<br/>
bicyclist, neither sleet nor snow nor dark of night, etc...), and I was<br/>
thinking, "I should write to Erik and show my support...", I have had<br/>
you on my mind especially lately.  Well, when I got home there was a <br/>
card from you.  It was nice.<br/>
<br/>
You've had a tough year, but then you've kept up your spirit so<br/>
wonderfully.  You go Erik!  Funny how God uses trials to inspire us.<br/>

That much is a given I suppose.<br/>

<br/>
Uusally the option is to do it that way, OR attach from the clipboard (your<br/>
computer's memory) OR some other way.  We have to think about how to do<br/>
this some more.  Randy is a good one to ask I think.  Randy has many times<br/>
told me he is willing to help with this.  I'm counting on it because he<br/>
is VERY sharp.<br/>
<br/>

You're getting ahead of me here.  How this part works will depend on how<br/>
we do the other part...  but, in essence, you are correct.<br/>
<br/>

Yes, and I wrote more about this in my other post.  Somehow you need to<br/>
know up front if it is a series you are working with (if you are adding<br/>
a box to an existing series.)  This requires some though also.<br/>
<br/>
I'm remembering all the milestones on how the process will work.  When we<br/>
are through deciding/visualizing it I'll get together with those who can<br/>
help on just the technical issues (how to make it a reality), and we will<br/>
implement it.  But that may be a while yet.  And it may change 3 or 4 times<br/>
in the interim.  That's how these things tend to work.<br/>
<br/>

You guys lead.  I'm a lackie.<br/>
<br/>
Or if I do lead its because I learn from you all how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the nice card.  Let me know if there's anything I can do for you.<br/>
I've been corresponding privately with Bonita (Massachusetts).  She's a<br/>
kind-hearted person.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
