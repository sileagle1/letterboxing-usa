<br/>
In a small square corner brick building at 798 Palm Street, part of <br/>
what was considered to be San Luis Obispo's Chinatown, Mr. Chong <br/>
opened his candy shop in 1950, having inherited the building from his <br/>
brother who ran a diner there for years.  Mr. Chong was a wonderful <br/>
man who made delicious candy, and his shop was known as a magical <br/>
place to visit for almost three decades, until he died in 1978.<br/>
<br/>
The building still stands, and is currently used as a real estate <br/>
office, but a plaque on the front tells of Mr. Chong and his candy.<br/>
