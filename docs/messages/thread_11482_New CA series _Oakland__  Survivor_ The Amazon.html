I have been a big fan of CBS's premier reality show Survivor since<br/>
the original series.  It is currently on its sixth cast, and 16 men<br/>
and women who were sent to the tropical rain forest of the Amazon for<br/>
39 days to battle it out, leaving the sole survivor $1,000,000<br/>
richer.  The motto of the show is to Outwit, Outplay and Outlast,<br/>
which might also work as the rallying cry of letterboxers sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
planted by PrincessLea on March 21, 2003<br/>
terrain:  medium difficulty - part smooth, part rocky dirt/ path with<br/>
some uphill climbs <br/>
rountrip distance - 1.7 miles (trail is a loop)<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  There is a variety of ways to get to the park, which is<br/>
located just east of the intersection of Grizzly Peak Blvd. and<br/>
Skyline Blvd.   Best to find your way on a map, either from Highway<br/>
24 or Highway 13.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 - Survivor Logo<br/>
The Amazon is dominated by its famous river and almost daily<br/>
thunderstorms - so the first box is hidden near water.  There are<br/>
some eucalyptus near a barbed wire fence - check behind one of the<br/>
boulders.  The hiding place is marked by large rock.<br/>
<br/>
Go back down trail to junction, take a hard right onto the trail<br/>
marked "to Volcanic Trail."  You will go through a cattle gate at the<br/>
beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 - Jaburu Tribe<br/>
On the first episode of Survivor: The Amazon, the men and women were<br/>
separated into same sex tribes - a gimmick which was new this season,<br/>
setting the scene for a Battle of the Sexes.  The women's team was<br/>
named Jaburu, which is the name of an Amazonian stork. <br/>
<br/>
On a small rise above marker #2 (which points out part of the wall of<br/>
the caldera of the volcano for which the park is named) is a large<br/>
bush/ tree.  Search in the branches on left side.  This box is the<br/>
most exposed of the series, so please take pains to cover it<br/>
completely when you leave. <br/>
<br/>
Proceed on the path and make a U turn at the juncture - toward "Round<br/>
Top Loop Trail." Follow the Round Top signs (don't go down into the<br/>
quarry!)<br/>
<br/>
Box #3 - Tambaqui Tribe<br/>
The tribe that was originally made up of men was called Tambaqui,<br/>
after an Amazonian fish.<br/>
<br/>
You will reach a cattle gate in a barbed wire fence.  Just past the<br/>
gate there is a grove of burned out eucalyptus trees.  Once through<br/>
the gate, you will see a large burned out stump; immediately in front<br/>
of it are two smaller logs perpendicular to each other - search at<br/>
their point of intersection.<br/>
<br/>
Continue along the rocky path until you reach an asphalt road; turn<br/>
left and walk down about  0.08 miles, where you will see a trail on<br/>
the right marked "Skyline Trail" and "Bay Area Ridge Trail."  Take<br/>
this trail to the last box.<br/>
<br/>
Box #4 - Immunity Idol<br/>
Half way down this trail is giant fallen redwood; its root system<br/>
will be on your left and stands about 4' high.  Go to the far side of<br/>
the trunk and look beneath it, at the spot marked by a bunch of pine<br/>
cones.  This is my favorite stamp of the series, so please re-pile<br/>
the cones when you're done to protect the hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
Continue to follow this trail - it will bring you back to where you<br/>
began your hike.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once Survivor: The Amazon airs all of its episodes, I will<br/>
probably add a couple more boxes to this series:  one of the ultimate<br/>
survivor (i.e., the winner!), the immunity necklace and the merged<br/>
tribe.  Thanks for playing Survivor!<br/>
