<br/>
Castella <br/>
(3 miles South of Dunsmuir or 45 miles North of Redding)<br/>
Shasta County<br/>
California<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take I-5 to Castella, Exit #724.  Head West, contribute <br/>
4 George Washingtons and head up hill to the Vista Point parking area.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:  Bring grey &amp; green markers for added effect.  This is a <br/>
steep, winding and narrow one car road at points.  Drive carefully.  <br/>
The trek itself is short (the kids were tired at the time) but don't <br/>
dare leave the area without at least first visiting the scenic <br/>
overlook for an incredible view if you don't take any other treks <br/>
during your visit.  Sorry for the boring clues, hopefully the great <br/>
views and the box will provide much compensation.  <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From the aCbRcAdGeSf Trailhead, find the 1st burnt, jagged <br/>
stump on your left (hint: a1b6c4d steps from beginning).  Then a9b5c <br/>
steps later, halt!  a1b2c steps N to a mossy stump 2.5'x3' is the <br/>
castle in which I reside.<br/>
