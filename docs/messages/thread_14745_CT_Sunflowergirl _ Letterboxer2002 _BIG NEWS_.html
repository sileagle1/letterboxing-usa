<br/>
On Wednesday we took a vacation to Newport, RI.  We did alot of <br/>
tourist shopping and enjoyed the first day with dinner at the RED <br/>
Parrot (great 12 oz. steak stuffed with lobster!)  After a long <br/>
stroll on the Easton Beach with the moon and stars and waves craching <br/>
on the shore we spent a brief night at the slot machines and retired <br/>
to our hotel across the street.  The next morning we walked the<br/>
Cliffwalk starting from the end and working our way to the begining <br/>
(not the original plan).  Worst of all ... we did it in snadals.  We <br/>
did not go searching for the letterbox (which still eludes me to this <br/>
day!)  When we reached the forty steps ... I asked Amy to go to the <br/>
bottom to take a picture.  I followed down after her a minute later <br/>
with a handmade card in one hand and a friendship ball in a lace <br/>
embroidered bag.  When I reached the bottom I read the handmade card <br/>
and asked her to MARRY ME!  Since then it has been a lot of hustle <br/>
and bustle to see all the family and schedule the church and <br/>
reception hall before we leave for West Palm Beach on Monday.  We <br/>
already have the church and priest booked for Saturday, July 10th, <br/>
2004 and we have appointments with 3 reception halls today.  Needless <br/>
to say ... we will not be able to head upstate for this exciting <br/>
letterboxing event.  However we now have a new traveler to take with <br/>
us!!!  We are very excited ... I hope to see you all very soon.<br/>
