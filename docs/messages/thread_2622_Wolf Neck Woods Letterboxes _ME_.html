activities on more than 200 acres of beautiful forest<br/>
and shoreline just 4 1/2 miles from HECTIC L.L. Bean<br/>
in Downtown Freeport, ME. Access Bow St. to Wolf Neck<br/>
Road, follow this to the state park. DO NOT, repeat DO<br/>
NOT be thrown off by the 2 dollar per adult entrance<br/>
fee (slightly less for children). The park and trails<br/>
are exquisitely maintained and the views of Casco Bay<br/>
are absolutely phenomanal!<br/>
     There are 5 miles of trails here, which you are<br/>
encouraged to enjoy! But, your walk will be<br/>
considerably shorter than that. Get a map from the<br/>
helpful Ranger at the park entrance or by the trail<br/>
network sign. YOU WILL NEED IT to find these boxes.<br/>
     Follow your map to Interpretive Sign #1. Here<br/>
depending on the season you can either enjoy the<br/>
Foliage Loop, or walk directly to I.S. #3, enjoy the<br/>
views here before continuing down this trail towards<br/>
Googins Island. Site in some Ospreys on the island,<br/>
before heading out on the trail again.<br/>
<br/>
      "Casco Bay Osprey"<br/>
Somewhere between 4 and 5<br/>
Theres a bridge you'll find.<br/>
On the bridges- eastern side,<br/>
A box, there,for you: I did hide,<br/>
Away from the watchful "Osprey's" eye.<br/>
      "Salty Hemlock"<br/>
Continue on the Casco Bay Trail,<br/>
Until no further it does avail.<br/>
Here it becomes the <br/>
Hemlock Ridge.<br/>
Follow the trail for a smidge,<br/>
when,<br/>
Suddenly you come upon Number Ten.<br/>
