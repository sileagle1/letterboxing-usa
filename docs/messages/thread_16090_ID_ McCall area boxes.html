                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lots of fun in McCall this past weekend.  I left a new box in McCall, <br/>
Playful Bears.  I was so excited to see folks stamped into my Camping <br/>
Trials and You've Got Fish boxes.  I even picked up a Hitchhiker <br/>
Dude...actually I'll have to go see what his name was as I think it <br/>
wasn't the dude this time.  <br/>
<br/>
Sad to say that Time to Fish and Heartland are missing so I deleted <br/>
them from the Clues page.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all who found our boxes.  =-)  I was excited to see <br/>
some new folks from Blackfoot stamping in.  Great to have you.  Also <br/>
thanks to the Oregon letterboxes who came our way as well.  I can't <br/>
tell you how I smiled to see others stamping in our boxes....so fun.<br/>
