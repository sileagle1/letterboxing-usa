<p><st1:place><st1:placetype>Fort</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>Macon</st1:placename></st1:place> is at the eastern end of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Atlantic</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Beach</st1:placetype></st1:place> island.<span>  </span>The Fort is opened from <st1:time hour="9" minute="0">9 am</st1:time> to <st1:time hour="17" minute="30">5:30</st1:time>, and there is no admission charge.<span>  </span>No pets, no food, no drink, though.<span>  </span>You will need to be discreet in finding, removing, and rehiding this box, as <st1:place><st1:placetype>Fort</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>Macon</st1:placename></st1:place> is the most visited park in <st1:state><st1:place>North Carolina</st1:place></st1:state>!<span>  </span>You should take some time to look around the Fort while you are there, and out on the beach the inlet is usually busy with people fishing, and kiting flying on Sundays.<span>  </span></p>
