is the owner of this box, but I do live in the area<br/>
and have been to visit it.<br/>
<br/>
I was there in the fall, and there were a fair number<br/>
of pricker bushes then, so the fact that it may now be<br/>
overgrown is very possible.  The trail is a small side<br/>
trail that may, or may not be regularly maintained.<br/>
<br/>
As for strollers and bikes, the box is not far off of<br/>
the main trail.  The main trail is fine for bikes.  Is<br/>
is covered in wood chips in most places, so could be<br/>
difficult for strollers.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is a long hike - there are of course shorter<br/>
ways if you know the park, but I too took the full<br/>
route the first time I went.  I now just periodically<br/>
go check them if boxers indicate a problem, since I<br/>
know Jay doesn't get up that often.<br/>
<br/>
As to the question for Jay - from what I saw last<br/>
fall, the box probably should be re-located.  There<br/>
were a lot of pricker bushes at the time I went, and<br/>
it now sounds like it is even worse.  I don't know if<br/>
you have plans to be in the area any time soon - but I<br/>
would be willing to go out and take a look, and<br/>
relocate it right in that area.  It is just something<br/>
I don't want to do without checking with you first<br/>
;o).  Let me know.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe feedback wasn't the right word--I had originally posted this <br/>
end of June, and had no response.  It was only my second box--I was <br/>
beginning to think I wasn't in the right place because it was so <br/>
overgrown.  I thought if someone else commented on the bees I would <br/>
know I was in the right place.  Also, I didn't know if the <br/>
term "bushwacking" which was used for the clue to Box 1 should be <br/>
interpreted literally, and you actually have to chop down the "bush", <br/>
or is it a term in this hobby that refers to a particular pace??  <br/>
Thanks for your response.<br/>
