Date planted: January 11, 2003<br/>
planted by: lowflier<br/>
County where located: Summers<br/>
Rated moderate due to slope and minor obstacles such as roots &amp; mud. <br/>
Details:<br/>
This box is located on a blazed (red) trail in a WV State Park known <br/>
as Pipestem.  It is close to the park's main lodge to make it <br/>
accessible to more people and there are many interesting features of <br/>
the park to enjoy while in the vicinity.  For example, the trailhead <br/>
is located at the edge of the arboretum and leads down the hillside <br/>
to just below Long Branch Lake where it intersects (at .6 mile) with <br/>
a trail that allows a loop back to the arboretum parking area.  The <br/>
park itself boasts two lodges, 25 guest cottages, a campground with <br/>
bath facilities, horse trails, a nature center, an arial tram and <br/>
incredible scenery focused around the Bluestone River Gorge.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions to the "Kind of Summer" letterbox:<br/>
Find the trailhead to "Den Tree Trail" located at the edge of the <br/>
arboretum across from the park's main lodge. Follow the trail's red <br/>
blazes downward along the hillside to where the trail levels off and <br/>
look for utility poles.  The letterbox is stashed underneath a rock <br/>
ledge visible from the trail.  The ledge is almost directly <br/>
underneath the wires spanning between the SECOND and THIRD utility <br/>
poles WITH TEE-LIKE CROSS PIECES AT THEIR TOPS. The ledge is in the <br/>
right of way of the utility so be especially cautious of sunning <br/>
snakes in any but the coldest weather.<br/>
Lowflier hopes visitors enjoy the hunt and the surrounding <br/>
attractions.  posted by lowflier F5P3<br/>
