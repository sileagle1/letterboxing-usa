Bethlehem, PA.<br/>
<br/>
Planted 1-6-02  By See Joy<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Rt. 378 to Mountain Drive North. Park is across from Lehigh <br/>
Valley PBS station.<br/>
<br/>
Type: Moderate 1hr loop hike.<br/>
<br/>
"Capricious"<br/>
<br/>
Follow the clues for South Mt. #1 to,"(at the tree with the vine scarred <br/>
trunk)".<br/>
<br/>
Right shoulder to tree<br/>
62 degrees<br/>
Through the vines, to the pines<br/>
Here North should be your choice,<br/>
At the "T" 290<br/>
Can you hear the men playing their game?<br/>
With shouts of joy and pleasure<br/>
Sometimes with shouts of pain!,<br/>
At the "5 ways" choose 60<br/>
Is this hard "top" a road or a wall?<br/>
Humpty would not have been worried<br/>
For there is no where to go in a fall!,<br/>
At the "North" steps, saunter Southward<br/>
Up the single track<br/>
History laid waste in the young woods...<br/>
Beware "Single Trackers"!! who go fast!!,<br/>
Next choice for me was 60<br/>
Past the "Eiffel",but not far..<br/>
"Dead sheep" north in the trees<br/>
(that's what the Mennonites call them..)<br/>
Check this out if you'd please,<br/>
Past that huge conglomeration<br/>
To the road and an "airport tower"?<br/>
Now before the "lost boys" bridge &amp; ladders<br/>
You should follow the ground lines of power...,<br/>
Between two trees the ridge top<br/>
On a rock you need to be standing<br/>
At the eastern base of the split rock (280)<br/>
Is where I have been planting!!<br/>
<br/>
To the road, into the sunset<br/>
Not far to get you back<br/>
Not much time gets you closer<br/>
To the single track,<br/>
You've been here before, now 290<br/>
Up the hill at 260 degrees<br/>
At the "5" ways (292)<br/>
Past the white fleshed trees,<br/>
It's the tree "lined" trail you follow<br/>
To the older of two roads<br/>
240 heads you back to your car<br/>
And there you can do as you please!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Life!! 'Box On!!<br/>
<br/>
