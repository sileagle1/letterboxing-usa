@ Molly's Celestial Series and some of the Marching Ants (will have <br/>
to go back for the others). We had 3 surprises today. Picked up a <br/>
hitch hiker and also found two other Letterboxes by accident. Not on <br/>
the web site? One was the Troll Box Letterbox and the second was <br/>
planted by Eastern Mountain Sports (you probably have to go to the <br/>
Waterford store for the clues). Cold day. I hate that it gets dark so <br/>
early now.<br/>
