I'm a high school teacher, and recently (last night) our phys ed teacher kind <br/>
of guilted me into being the cheerleading coach this year.  He was talking <br/>
about how much the kids would appreciate it, how they're all so stressed that <br/>
they might not have a squad this year...  And so I said yes.  But I don't know <br/>
the first thing about cheerleading.  If you have any tips at all, as a coach, <br/>
or if someone here is a former cheerleader or something, please email!  I can <br/>
use all the help I can get!<br/>

Fight, exuberantly, fight!  Compel them to relinquish the ball!<br/>

Okay, okay, today's kids have a different vernacular, but I still chuckle<br/>

Even though kids are already beyond their years, I love hearing them cheer<br/>
this one ...<br/>

Give me an A (cheerleaders form the letter A; fans cheer -A-)<br/>
Give me a double-L (cheerleaders raise both arms; fans cheer -double L-)<br/>
Give me an eye (cheerleaders point to an eye; fans cheer -I-)<br/>
Give me a gator (cheerleaders curl their hands; fans yell gator and mimic<br/>

Alligator, Alligator, eat'em up, eat'em up (everyone opens and closes arms<br/>
in an alligator-like fashion)<br/>
