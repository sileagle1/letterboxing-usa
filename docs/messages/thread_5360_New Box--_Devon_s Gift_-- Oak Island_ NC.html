                    <html><body>Howdy we've placed our first letter box "Devon's Gift"* on Oak Island, NC (near Southport, NC) May 12th, 2002.
<br/>
<br/>If you have the good fortune visit Oak Island please seek out "Devon's Gift".
<br/>Take the bridge over to the Island and turn right onto Oak Island Drive.  You will turn right after the shell/gift shop that's painted hot pink...go all the way down to the end. You will run into Yacht Club Drive, take a left follow it and all it's turns...all the time keeping your eyes peeled on the right side for the place you'd want to live if you were a butterfly.  It might be a short distance, it might be half way down the Island....but you'll know it when you see it.  Find the Black Cherry Tree that speaks to you...it's there, behind the trunk in a little bramble.  Please take care to cover it back up.  
<br/>Good luck.
<br/>Write us and let us know about you.  LoveLetterBoxing@aol.com 
<br/>
<br/>*"Devon's Gift" named after our friend Devon who turned us on to this very cool hobby.
