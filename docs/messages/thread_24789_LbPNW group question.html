Hm- fending of pervs in AL makes it sound like he's doing time.<br/>
<br/>
You could try AQ-mailing him at AtlasQuest- he's not checking in every  <br/>
day but he does check in regularly.<br/>

I signed up for that group, as well.  It didn't take long for me to get approved for the group - only a couple of days. I'm not sure if a delay would be on a letterboxing side or the Yahoo! side . . . does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!! :)  Sure hope that gets resolved quickly for you!! :)<br/>
