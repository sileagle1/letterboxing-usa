I missed Kate's note and went looking for it myself this morning. It's <br/>
a neat place, but I too searced high and low and I just don't think <br/>
it's there.  Has anyone else seen the box recently?  I'd be happy to <br/>

I'm new enough not to know what to do here.  Do we need to tell someone<br/>
this, or will the powers that be make a note on the website?  Also, my<br/>
niece wants to get a dog so she can get a stamp like Molly's.<br/>

As far as I know, there is no system where the webmaster just pulls it from the list or leaves a note about it on the page but I could be wrong. Hope Molly and your niece can meet someday. She could do an exchange and get a copy of Molly's stamp! Maybe we will all meet someday at a letterboxing event or on the trail. Good luck and happy letterboxing.....Chuck &amp; Molly P35F130X19
