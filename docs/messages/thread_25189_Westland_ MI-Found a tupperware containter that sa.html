I have woods across the street from my house.  They don't get used much, and the trail is overgrown with grass, trees etc.  I took my dog for a walk and we tried to walk the paths..then I seen this tupperware box with a sticker on it that said, letterbox do not remove.  I never heard of this..as I just looked it up on a whim today cuz I was curious to what was in this box.  It looked like something was in it.  I was too afraid to pick it up.  Should I look in it?  People don't visit these woods so  I dont know why a letter box would be in this area??  Any suggestions??<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yep, pick it up, check it out. When you're done, rehide it back where you found it. There might be contact information in the logbook so that you can get in touch with the person who placed it there to let them know you found it. Also if you find out the name of the box, you can search for it on www.letterboxing.org to see the clues (and clues for finding other boxes in your area). You might have a brand new hobby =)<br/>

Hi.<br/>
I have woods across the street from my house. They don't get used much, and the trail is overgrown with grass, trees etc. I took my dog for a walk and we tried to walk the paths..then I seen this tupperware box with a sticker on it that said, letterbox do not remove. I never heard of this..as I just looked it up on a whim today cuz I was curious to what was in this box. It looked like something was in it. I was too afraid to pick it up. Should I look in it? People don't visit these woods so I dont know why a letter box would be in this area?? Any suggestions??<br/>
