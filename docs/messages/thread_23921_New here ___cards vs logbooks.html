<br/>
&gt; Question?<br/>
&gt; My idea is to collect my stamps on 3 1/2 X 5 index cards that I can<br/>
&gt; put in am album as opposed to carring around a journal with ALL<br/>
&gt; my "found" stampings in it... I would record info about the hunt,<br/>
&gt; date, location, etc. on the card next to the stamp... What is the<br/>
&gt; community thought on this?<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My scrapbook is actually quite simple.  Simple but complete. I'm no<br/>
perfectionist.  (Actually, I don't know a cropper who is a perfectionist,<br/>
but my world is small in that department.)  I gear the scrapbook towards "in<br/>
case I ever have to return to that spot."   Tho I do put a lot of personal<br/>
artwork in my scrapbook.  The placement of the letterbox will often suggest<br/>
a nice watercolor theme to me.<br/>
<br/>
In the scrapbook, I have the stamp image, I have a copy of the clues, I have<br/>
handwritten notes, and I have copies of any maps I used.  That way, if<br/>
someone is having trouble finding the box and suspects it's missing and they<br/>
ask me to go check because I've already found it, I know just how to get<br/>
there to go check.  Or if another placer plants a box in the same park or<br/>
area, I can flip to the pages in my scrapbook where I have the maps for the<br/>
previous box I found in that same area.  I note any "shortcuts" I took.  I<br/>
also have it noted on the maps if the placer made a mistake in their clues<br/>
in any way so that I can quick note it if I have to go after another box in<br/>
that area.  Some placers will correct mistakes in clues if they find out<br/>
about them, some won't.  Some "mistakes" are actually challenges in the<br/>
clues so shouldn't be changed anyway for the sake of the character of the<br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
It has really come in handy down the road.  I can't count how many times I<br/>
was going online or into my computer to search for the Salt Creek Bicycle<br/>
Trail map until I started the scrapbook because there are/were a lot of<br/>
boxes planted in that same area.  Now I just flip to that page in the<br/>
scrapbook and save some time.   Or I might discover a really cool unusual<br/>
map online and just know I'll never find my way back to it if my computer<br/>
crashes and I lose my "Favorite Places."  So just in case my computer<br/>
crashes and my external hard-drive backup also fails, I'll have a paper copy<br/>
in my scrapbook.  :-)  Can ya tell I don't trust computers much?  (Yet, in<br/>
all these years with my e-machine, I've yet to have a crash -- knock on wood<br/>
hard enough to break my fingers.)<br/>
<br/>
When I think about it, in a way my scrapbook is much more all about the maps<br/>
than all about the letterboxes.  I think I must be some sort of closet<br/>
cartographer.  Maps have always fascinated me.  As a little kid I never<br/>
failed to get an A in geography.  Actually, much to the consternation of my<br/>
teachers, maps were the only thing in art where I was comfortable coloring<br/>
inside the lines.  I do wraps gifts in maps when I'm wrapping gifts for<br/>
children and call it "educational".  So my "letterboxing" scrapbook is maybe<br/>
just my excuse for having maps close around me.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Odd thing is -- I can't follow a map worth a ........<br/>
