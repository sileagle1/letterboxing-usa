I do not usually put in my 2 cents worth but I can't stand it anymore.  I<br/>
joined this e-group to gain help, get ideas, read constructive e-mails about<br/>
this wonderful hobby that I have enjoyed with my girls since last July.  Not<br/>
listen to a masked man, that does not get along with another man, and we all<br/>
have to spend our time reading the garbage, and I mean garbage, from him<br/>
every time Steve sends out an e-mail.  Get over yourself and send Steve a<br/>
private e-mail.  I have had enough of it all.  Can't you see from all of the<br/>
other recent e-mails that we would like to get back to what this e-group is<br/>
all about?  Help, guidance, missing boxes, new boxes, comments about boxes,<br/>
etc. I have a headache over this.  Gone for a long weekend, come home to<br/>
catch up on e-mails and find out that the war is not over with yet. Willow.<br/>

Just some friendly advice,  delete!! Do not even open any problematic e-mail<br/>
coming from either party writing junk!  their username is idenifing who they<br/>
are.  I only open what pertains to me or suggestions I need. That means I<br/>
delete without opening 85%.  I hope this helps.<br/>

Willow, If you sign up for the digest you will find it much easier <br/>
to eliminate and pass by those posts that hold no interest. It will <br/>
save wear and tear on your psyche and you will be able to read those <br/>
posts that contain valuable letterboxing information. While I think <br/>
this chat list should be for letterboxing and not tutorials for web <br/>
site building or promotion, I certainly believe that if folks <br/>
continue pushing their products, other than their latest <br/>
letterboxes,then they open themselves up to criticisms of all types. <br/>
Sometimes when attempts have been made at private communications <br/>
they have not been well received, and degrade into uncivil emails <br/>
thus the private communications are severed.I believe that as long <br/>
as civility reigns, those off topic subjects should be allowed to <br/>
pop up but we have the choice to read or not,and you and I and <br/>
others have the right and obligation to comment.<br/>
