                    <html><body>Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am re-posting this because I didn't include the state in my first post....<br/>
<br/>
Here's the directions to our Elbe Train Letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
~ In the small town of Elbe, WA (near Mt. Rainier), park in the parking lot of the Elbe Steam Engine Train Ride. You'll see a large holly tree and picnic tables to the right of the parking lot when you are facing the black steam engine.<br/>
~ Face the direction of the river; you'll see an opening to a wide trail; there is a house to the right of the trail and the Elbe Church that is a national historical landmark is next to the house. Take the wide trail towards the river.<br/>
~ Follow the trail until you come to a Y; at this Y take a left.<br/>
~ Follow the trail until you come to another Y; at this Y take a right.<br/>
~ Follow this trail to the river &amp; go downstream until you reach a group of cedar saplings to your left.<br/>
~ From the group of cedar saplings, take approximately 30 paces downstream; there will be 2 trees approximately 2 1/2 ft. apart - one has 2 small trunks twisted together, the other is about 8" in diameter - facing the river in front of the 8" diameter tree, look to the right for the largest rock; there you'll find your treasure!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy the adventure; be sure to go downstream a bit more to find lots of animal tracks and droppings like elk, deer and beaver! There's also a beaver's home complete with knawed-off trees. Be sure to also take a peak in the Church which is interesting! Oh! and if you want lunch, be sure to get 'The Overload' at the tiny Scaleburgers place across from The Hobo Inn.<br/>
