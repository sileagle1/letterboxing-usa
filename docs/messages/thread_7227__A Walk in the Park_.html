"A Walk in the Park"<br/>
<br/>
Zuck Park is a 20 Acre Community Park located on Zuck Road at Grandview Blvd. in Millcreek Township. The land was a gift to the city of Erie, given by Joseph Zuck on April 25,1925. On June 15 1972, Erie County negotiated a lease with the City to use the area for a park. In 1985, the County did not renew the lease and gave the property back to the City of Erie. The gates were closed and the park remained closed until an agreement was reached with Millcreek Township in July of 1987.<br/>
<br/>
Today the Park has tennis courts, a softball field, covered picnic pavilions grills and scattered picnic tables, swings, slides, monkey  bars, benches, restrooms and much of the park is handicap accessible. Please park in the lot just North of Grandview off Zuck Rd. Enter at the south lot ... and exit from the north lot. <br/>
<br/>
"A Walk in the Park" is an easy 2 part hunt that should take about 15 to 30 minutes depending on how many stops you make along your way. It is a good idea to have a simple directional compass to help you find which way you will be heading. You may want to pack a picnic or just a few snacks to enjoy at one of the pavilions ... or let the kids have fun at the playground after their search is over. <br/>
