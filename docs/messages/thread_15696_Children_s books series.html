one; am flexible about which...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of my childhood favorites that haven't yet been spoken for AFAIK:<br/>
    The Phantom Tollbooth<br/>
    The Little Princess<br/>
    The Secret Garden<br/>
    Anne of Green Gables<br/>
<br/>
When I was a bit younger, I also liked (and still like):<br/>
    We Were Tired of Living in a House<br/>
    The Tenth Good Thing About Barney<br/>
<br/>
of my (pre-K &amp; toddler) kids' favorites that are very new, the ones I <br/>
love the most include:<br/>
    Jamberry<br/>
    Big Red Barn<br/>
    Pickle and the Ball<br/>
    Counting Kisses<br/>
and, most recently:<br/>
    One Beautiful Baby<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there are plenty of others I'm forgetting.  Can't decide which <br/>
I'd most like to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a fairy/folk tale series (for things like Rapunzel, Snegurochka, <br/>
and The Firebird) in addition?  Also, if anyone is up for planting a <br/>
series featuring famous not-too-recent poems, I'd like to carve Poe's <br/>
Raven if there isn't already such a stamp out there.<br/>
