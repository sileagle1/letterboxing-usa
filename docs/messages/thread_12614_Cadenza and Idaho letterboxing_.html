Yes, you should head up thru the Salmon area and cross the divde into the Treasure State.  There are zillions of great places to put boxes but alas there are too few placed  I see that someone recentlly planted one south of Missoula in the Blodget Canyon.  Hope to get there soon, although it will be a 100 mile rooound trip for one box.  Great places in the area to camp so there area other benfits.  Lewis and Clark came thru the Bitterroot Valley so I am full of ideas for boxes.  Also as you cross over the Idaho Mt divde one can head east and visit the Big Hole Battle Feild, another great place for boxes!  Quiltmaker and I planted  a series of 4 boxes in the Rattlesnake recreation area on the north side of Missoula this afternoon.  Hope to get them in the system soon.  So, we have six boxes for you and others to find.  Thanks for the support.  Rockmover<br/>
