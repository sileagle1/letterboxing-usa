    I had stamped into that box with my kids when it was not very old. I<br/>
went back a few weeks ago to replace my stamp image on better paper but did<br/>
not locate the box. It was getting dark but my initial impression was that<br/>
the sporting club that owns the land had redone the targets. We may need<br/>
Warrior Woman to locate the old location if that is the case. I may give it<br/>
another try if I get the chance.<br/>

&gt; I was out today looking for Warrior Woman's Hunter Falls letterbox.  Anyone<br/>
&gt; found it recently?  I located Target 1; found the orange rebar, but no rock<br/>
&gt; and no letterbox.  Found two of her other boxes, though, so it was a good<br/>
&gt; day with a walk on some of the trails in Callahan State Park.<br/>

It looked like Hunters Falls was on private property though. The<br/>
trail was marked no trespassing to non-members byt the bridge. So <br/>
perhaps the box was removed.<br/>
