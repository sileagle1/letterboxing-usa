                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back home from Zuck Park in Erie PA.  I went on "A Walk <br/>
in the Park", but I couldn't find either letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
I went over the trails several times counting out paces both as <br/>
single-step and as double-step.  Ended up searching *every* tree <br/>
stump on either side of the trail.  Admittedly, there aren't that <br/>
many and the one that's 70 single-steps down the trail is the only <br/>
one where the description "under the stump" is possible. <br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find the second box either.  Counting out single and <br/>
double step paces takes you to the head and foot of the same fallen <br/>
tree, so I searched it from end to end.  No box.  It's possible I <br/>
simply missed both boxes, but I'm reasonably sure I found the <br/>
correct locations.<br/>
<br/>
Is there going to be a webpage on the new site for reporting missing <br/>
boxes?<br/>
