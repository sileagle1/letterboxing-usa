                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh NO!   Professor Utopia has been kidnapped by an enemy of the Powerpuff <br/>
girls!!!   EEEK!  The three Powerpuff Girl's ... disguised as Pencil <br/>
Sharpener Travel Bugs ... are in search of him at this very moment.<br/>
  Help reunite them by letting the Professor hitch hike with you to the next <br/>
letterbox/geocache hybrid.  Be sure to stamp him in after you leave him <br/>
there, safe &amp; dry.  You never know, the girls might arrive at that same box <br/>
in search of him at a later date.  Also Stamp Professor U into any other log <br/>
books you may encounter before dropping him off!<br/>
<br/>
  Watch out for arch villain Mojo Jojo who is also on the loose.  If these <br/>
two end up at the same box be sure to record their adventures in Professor <br/>
Utopia's log book.<br/>
  Professor Utopia was last seen with Blossom before he was treacherously <br/>
kidnapped!<br/>
  After safely planting Professor Utopia, please send a note of where you <br/>
picked him up ...but not where you planted him ... to <br/>
letterbox-usa@egroups.com  . Also Professor U carries with him a dogtag <br/>
...please follow its instructions<br/>
