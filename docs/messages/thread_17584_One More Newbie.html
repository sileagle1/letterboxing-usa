I'm another newbie to this group and to letterboxing. I live in Dallesport, WA, right along the Columbia River Gorge. Thanks to the person that mentioned the yahoo group that is made up of mostly PNW folks. <br/>

This looks like great fun, and I look forward to spending many pleasant hours enjoying nature and hunting for boxes.<br/>

I am new to letterboxing and this group as well.  I went with my addicted mother and sisters in Oregon...and I am hooked now too.  I currently live in the Nashville area, and there aren't many around here...but when I go home to Oregon I will have to really go searching.  I want to plant some in this area and spread the word.  I think I have lots of friends that would be interested.<br/>
<br/>
Any one from TN?<br/>
<br/>
Have a GREAT weekend!<br/>

Keep in mind that if you plant them, they will come!<br/>

Therefore, all of my boxes so far have been placed in cities.  <br/>
Mostly I put them outdoors rather than inside so that they will be <br/>
available to hunters 24/7.  I did place one inside a bookstore, with <br/>
permission.  But it's a really, really cool bookstore and they keep <br/>
long hours.  It's one of my favorite carvings, though, so I might do <br/>
it again and place a copy outside as well for after-hours hunters.<br/>

In general, I think even urban boxes should be outdoors so they'll <br/>

Urban letterboxing has it's own challenges.  Finding a hiding place <br/>
