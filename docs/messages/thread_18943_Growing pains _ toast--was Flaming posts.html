                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Kerri... very well-said.  It's hard to imagine this happening with dancing, but it's good for us to know this, and I certainly believe you. I've never been on a talk list like this, only ones where I know all the participants personally &amp; communicate in other ways besides the list.  When I first joined this one, I felt and said that I thought it was a really wonderful bunch of people.  I still think so, and believe we can learn to use this tool better and save it from its own destruction.  "Growing Pains" is what I would call what's been happening.  As long as those don't become what we had in the cold war-- M.A.D.  Chills my bones.  I loved the hugs and chicken soup someone mentioned-- that's about what my mom would do: invite y'all in for fastnacht doughnuts and shoofly pie, whether or not fastnacht day is long past. The love would flow again. Hmmm, there's a few more PA letterbox ideas to chew on.   Well, I'm making French toast in a few hours, and you're all invited, along with nice words in our inboxes. (BYOBox!) Boxes and inboxes... little boxes, little boxes. --lunaryakketyact<br/>
