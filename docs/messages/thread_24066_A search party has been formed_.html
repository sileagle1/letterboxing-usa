<br/>
as some of you may know, gingerbread jim has been kidnapped. it has <br/>
been decided by local officials, to organize a search party to comb the <br/>
state for him. with winter lacking its luster in the northeast, there <br/>
is concern that winter will not hold off much longer. if the winter <br/>
comes and Jim is not found, he may not make it through alive. i have <br/>
also been warned that the locals only have enough funding for a month <br/>
long search.<br/>
<br/>
jim has not been heard from in a few weeks now and by his last letter, <br/>
he didn't sound well at all. i can only hope that everyone will try to <br/>
find time in your busy schedules to help find jim. his life depends on <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
a copy of his letters are posted on a special website dedicated to <br/>
saving jim. http://savingjim.blogspot.com<br/>
<br/>
may your search be successful.<br/>
