                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from a vacation in the mountains of Tennessee and <br/>
placed three boxes on my trip. One I believe will be the first one in <br/>
the state of South Carolina. The other two are in the Great Smoky <br/>
Mountains National Park, on the Tennessee side of the mountains. I <br/>
will post the clues separately in the next day or so as I write them <br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately only one letterbox was close enough to me for me to <br/>
attempt to find it. That was the Max Patch box in North Carolina, and <br/>
I gave up because the mountain access road was IMHO much too <br/>
dangerous to continue. Assuming I found the correct road, which was <br/>
right at the exit off I-40 in the middle of the mountains, I have <br/>
concerns about the safety of attempting this box. According to the <br/>
clue posted it, the beginning of the hike was 8.2 miles up this <br/>
access road which winds along the edge of the mountains. The road is <br/>
a winding single lane dirt road that at one time apparently had a <br/>
significant amount of gravel. However when I was there most of the <br/>
gravel apparently had washed away previously. It had rained lightly <br/>
the night before for the first time in a long time. Consequently, <br/>
much of the road was not dry, but rather a slippery mixture of wet <br/>
dirt/clay. There is no shoulder or anything like a guardrail, and <br/>
consequences of a vehicle slipping off the side of the road would <br/>
almost certainly be fatal. I went very cautiously about two to three <br/>
miles up the mountain before deciding it was just too unsafe to <br/>
continue. Besides the conditions of the road, my other concern was <br/>
the narrowness of the road which would be exceedingly difficult to <br/>
deal with if I encountered a vehicle coming down the mountain. There <br/>
are some areas to turnabout spaced about every half mile or so, but <br/>
other than that I cannot see how you could deal with an oncoming <br/>
vehicle apart from one vehicle going in reverse until reaching a turn <br/>
about, not an appealing thought to me. Consequently, I am  not at all <br/>
sure I would have continued even if the road had been dry. Too bad, I <br/>
really wanted to get up there to the box. I would caution anyone <br/>
attempting this box to _carefully_ consider the weather and driving <br/>
conditions before heading up that road. If it wasn't such a long hike <br/>
up the road, I would have just walked from the bottom. Perhaps some <br/>
will think that I was too cautious, but I don't think so. Anyways, <br/>
anyone who tries will need to make their own decisions about it.<br/>
<br/>
The box I hid in South Carolina is on a beautiful island off the <br/>
coast. The two boxes in the Smoky Mountains are along very nice hikes <br/>
to some waterfalls. As I mentioned, I'll post the clues in the next <br/>
day or so.<br/>

Yeah, that road is pretty intense, but the view from the top is<br/>
unbelievable.  Of course, the prefered way to get there is to<br/>
thru hike the AT :-)<br/>

Do you happen to know how far it would be from the nearest popular AT <br/>
access to the Max Patch box? I would like to try that next time I get <br/>
that way, probably in the spring.<br/>

Nope.  We're prolly both way over the line in letterboxing etiquette<br/>
as far as discussing how to find other peoples' boxes, though.  Sorry<br/>
folks :-)<br/>
