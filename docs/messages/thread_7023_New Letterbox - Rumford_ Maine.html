Rumford, Maine<br/>
<br/>
Planted by "the Family"(Yuzi, CERK, VFTR, butterbaby, spunky spaniel, <br/>
and rtrw) on August 16th, 2002 at the end of a lovely vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Distance - 15 feet<br/>
Time - as long as it takes you to stamp up<br/>
Difficulty - my cat could find this one<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This box is located on the west side of Rumford, Maine.  Turn off <br/>
Route 2 across from the public boat launch onto Dragoon Road. This is <br/>
near the McDonald's restaurant.  Make your first and only right and <br/>
watch on the left side for Grandfather Maple. Behind him, covered<br/>
with two brook rocks and a few sticks is your prize, thought up and <br/>
hand carved by the spaniel.  Enjoy.  Email me at rtrw@attbi.com with <br/>
any updating that needs to be done.  I'll arrange it. <br/>
