<br/>
A Gorey Tribute Box or Series would be fabulous. Especially <br/>
given that the "wood-cuttish" nature of his illustrations seem to <br/>
lend themselves to be depicted in stamp-form rather easily. (Of <br/>
course one would have to be a *Master-Carver*)<br/>
<br/>
I've got a first-edition Dracula Toy Theater from the early 80's that <br/>
I picked up ..... ummmm ..... many years ago. (Yeeesh, I'm old)<br/>
