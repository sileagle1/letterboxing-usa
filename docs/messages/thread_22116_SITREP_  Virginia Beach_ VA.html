                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday afternoon before catching my flight home I found the <br/>
following boxes in Virginia Beach, VA:<br/>
<br/>
Fort Story Lighthouse:  What a great spot!  I climbed up to the top <br/>
of the lighthouse and what a view!  This box is alive and well but <br/>
log book is getting full.<br/>
<br/>
Eggcellent Eggstravaganza:  A fun series, but turned out to be a <br/>
little messy coloring all the Easter eggs!  All 6 boxes are in fine <br/>
shape.  <br/>
<br/>
Wild Indoors: I wonderful place for a letterbox!  If you haven't <br/>
been there yet you should.  The store is great! (The box is too!)<br/>
<br/>
I was disappointed that my time ran short and I had to head to the <br/>
airport before getting the box at Mt. Trashmore.  Mt. Trashmore is <br/>
such a neat name I was looking forward to going there.  Next time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the box creators.<br/>
