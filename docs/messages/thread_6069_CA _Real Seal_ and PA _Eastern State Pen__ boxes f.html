Eastern State Penitentiary Box in Pennsylvania on July 7th.<br/>
So just a note to let you folks know that both boxes are alive and <br/>
well. <br/>
<br/>
Eastern State Penitentiary was a really neat place to visit.  I <br/>
recommend that if you are visiting the Philly area that you add it to <br/>
your list of the Liberty Bell and Betsy Ross' House. :-) (not to <br/>
mention that there is a letterbox there!!)<br/>
<br/>
After surviving the 4th of July in LA, I dragged a non-letterboxing <br/>
friend down to find the Real Seal! Thank Goodness I found it, or she <br/>
would have thought that I was making up all this <br/>
Letterboxing "nonsense"!!  <br/>
