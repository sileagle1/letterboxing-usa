city and county unspecified<br/>
<br/>
Background - The Beale Treasure is a large quantity of gold found in modern<br/>
day New Mexico back around 1820, brought to Bedford Virginia, and buried<br/>
while it's owners went back west to mine some more. They never made it back.<br/>
While the document describing the treasure was decoded using the Declaration<br/>
of Independence as the key, the document describing the location of the<br/>
buried treasure have never been decrypted.<br/>
    That's the abbreviated version of the story. Good summaries of the full<br/>
legend are at http://www.unmuseum.org/beal.htm and<br/>
http://smd173.tripod.com/Beale/ .<br/>
    Different websites describing the Beale Treasure has slight variations<br/>
in the typing of the DOI. Some hyphenate one certain word or combine another<br/>
pair of words into one. Some use ampersands that make the word count<br/>
different. To get this series off to an easy, smooth start, get the<br/>
"official" version from the National Archives. After this one, you're on<br/>
your own when picking the key documents.<br/>
<br/>
A Note about the Stamp - I can't carve for anything. I have a choice between<br/>
a horrid stamp image or some photographs of the area on mailing labels. I<br/>
made the untraditional choice (photos on labels). If a traditional stamp is<br/>
important to you, you'll need to pick other boxes to look for. Except for<br/>
the NMLBP (Jolly G-Man and Ladybug carved those stamps), that disclaimer<br/>
will go for anything I plant.<br/>
<br/>
    Happy hunting. Mike - F43 P3?<br/>
