Hello all.  My name is Jocelyn and although I joined this list several <br/>
months ago I haven't been an active member.  I have moved 4 times in <br/>
the past year and as a result didn't feel I had much to offer for the <br/>
time being.  I would like to introduce myself (finally) and hope to <br/>
become more and more active as time goes on. <br/>
<br/>
My husband and I have only been letterboxing since this past fall, on <br/>
Cape Cod and in New Jersey.  Not much I know, but I have to admit I am <br/>
addicted!  I carved stamps for my husband and parents as well (another <br/>
addition in itself).  I will be living in Grenada, West Indies, on and <br/>
off for the next year.  Being a big sailing area I wondered if there <br/>
were any letterboxes around here.  Could anyone recommend some world <br/>
wide letterbox sites that may have boxes in the Caribbean to me?  You <br/>
could e-mail me off list if that would be more appropriate or onlist if <br/>
you think others would benefit.  My e-mail is jocehastings@yahoo.com.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you and I look forward to getting to know everyone.<br/>
Jocelyn<br/>

There are a few Caribbean letterboxes listed on <br/>
letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com. On letterboxing.org, <br/>
go to the letterbox search page and use the State drop <br/>
list to go down to the bottom and select "Virgin Islands", <br/>
"Lesser Antilles" or "Other International".<br/>

Dear Choi,<br/>
Thank you for the directions!  I found clues for one in Carriacou, <br/>
which is part of the Grenadines.  I will try to find that sometime <br/>
within the next year.  I have also decided that I should take advantage <br/>
of my time down here and plant one on each island that I visit.  I have <br/>
so much fun finding boxes others have created I want to start giving <br/>
back as well.  Note to self, buy supplie when visiting parents in the <br/>
States this July...  I should be able to put boxes in Grenada, St. <br/>
Vincent, Petite Martinique, Barbados, and Margarita and perhaps others <br/>
if I am lucky enough.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
Jocelyn<br/>

The Secret Gardeners from B.C. have recently moved to Barbados. They <br/>
and their daughter, Canada Goose, may well have placed some boxes there <br/>
by the time you visit. Try to track them down... Funhog<br/>
