months back!  We attempted the box in April and had no luck even <br/>
reaching the trailhead since the snow was so deep at the time.  I <br/>
wonder how drastically the landscape changes after the snow melts--I <br/>
can only imagine that it is quite different from season to season.  <br/>
Maybe we should look for the letterbox in the Nisqually River or <br/>
Puget Sound somewhere?  ;)<br/>
