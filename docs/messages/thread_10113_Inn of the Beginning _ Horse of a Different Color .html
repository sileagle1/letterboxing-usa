the Inn of the Beginning at Rocky Neck.  We had it on good authority <br/>
that the stamp was great.  All I can say is WOW!!  It is AMAZING!  We <br/>
must have spent 10 minutes at the box just examining the stamp.  I <br/>
just can't say enough about it.  We picked up a Horse of a Different <br/>
Color HH at the hostel and will be riding him off to another location <br/>
very soon.  Very clever, by the way.  We had a good laugh about it.  <br/>
Thank you to both Jay and Judy &amp; Fred.<br/>
