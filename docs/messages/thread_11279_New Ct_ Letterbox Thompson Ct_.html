<br/>
Planted By: Teach &amp; Preach<br/>
Location: Thompson Ct. Windham County<br/>
Rated: Easy 10-15 min.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Rt. 171West through Putnam.  Just pass the sign that <br/>
says Welcome to Woodstock Home of the Woodstock Fair.  Take your <br/>
first right onto West Thompson Rd.  Drive 1.8 miles, you'll turn left <br/>
into a parking area just before the dam.  From the flag pole, go to <br/>
the fence and follow to the end down a small hill.  At the end, head <br/>
in a heading of 330 degrees.  You will be going away from the field <br/>
and into woods.   You'll pass a huge pile of logs.  There will be a <br/>
stone wall on your right.  When you come to your first yellow blaze <br/>
on a pine tree, head left to the 2nd corner in the stone wall.  It's <br/>
about 35 steps away from the yellow blaze.  The St. Louis Letterbox <br/>
is hidden behind 1 rock and some sticks.  <br/>
Have fun Teach &amp; Preach (with the help of Little Piggy &amp; Nappy Kitty)<br/>
