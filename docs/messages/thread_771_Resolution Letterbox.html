                    <div class="plaintext-content">Placed January 1, 2000 at Rocky Neck State Park in East Lyme, CT. This<br/>
is a single letterbox by the sea, on a bluff between two lovely salt<br/>
estuaries. The hike covers 2  easy miles, with an option for another<br/>
3/4 mile of level beach combing. <br/>
<br/>
Directions: on I-95 take exit 72, the Rocky Neck Connector. At the<br/>
bottom of the hill, the main entrance to the park is to the left. We'll<br/>
go right on Rte. 156 West to park at a hiker's entrance that avoids the<br/>
seasonal fees and crowds. Heading uphill on this road, park on your<br/>
left at the top<br/>
of the hill, across from a campground, in an unmarked lot. Your car<br/>
will be quite safe here: this is where all the local walkers park.<br/>
<br/>
Walk south through the gate and past a map of the trails. Continue<br/>
south on the blue trail, and then turn left (east-southeast) on the red<br/>
blazed Bride Brook Trail. Pass a nicely balanced glacial erratic to the<br/>
left and travel pleasantly downhill for half a mile. Bear right at a<br/>
crossover fork and<br/>
then straight with the red where the white trail joins in. The grade<br/>
levels out: pass along a forested tongue between salten estuaries<br/>
before crossing a bridge near osprey nests.<br/>
<br/>
Exiting into a picnic ground/parking lot, head south to pass between<br/>
the snack bar and the bath house. Walk under the railroad bridge and<br/>
onto the beach. Your optional beach comb is to the left: the long<br/>
curving beach leads to a tidal inlet that just fascinates children and<br/>
nature lovers. Collect some shells, rocks, and driftwood, and then head<br/>
west up to the magnificent "Pavilion." This dance hall was built of<br/>
stone in the Arts and Crafts style by the CCC and WPA in 1936, and is<br/>
still quite popular with the summer people from Hartford. Walk west<br/>
from the railroad underpass up the ramps to the porch (with another<br/>
optional exploration southwards along the<br/>
rocks and jetties). Crossing northeasterly along the wide stone porch,<br/>
enjoy the marvelous views and imagine the grand dances and swing music<br/>
of the old days.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the porch, turn left (north) and bridge over the railroad<br/>
tracks. Kids will thrill to passing trains. Bear sharp left with the<br/>
paving after the bridge and parallel the tracks behind the Pavilion. As<br/>
the paved road begins to bear right, cut left on a faint path and<br/>
follow the cliff line<br/>
north with a new estuary below to the west. The trails are briefly<br/>
unmarked here, but easy to follow: just stay near the edge and head<br/>
north. Almost reaching the top, find an expansive view on a smooth<br/>
rounded granite cliff with faded yellow trail markers here and there.<br/>

You guys, as usual, have been BUSY! What a great way to spend New Year's<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
Altho I've never seen the Pavilion dance hall, I know the style, having<br/>
seen what I assume are similar (style) buildings in the in parks in the<br/>
Hudson Valley region.  Don't know which is the greater attraction - your<br/>
letterboxes OR (as we are both architects) the Arts and Crafts dance<br/>
hall. Did you get to 100 boxes?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Erik, you're right about the beauty of the Arts and Crafts buildings<br/>
around: as a California boy I grew up thinking that "bungalows" were<br/>
just the norm. Now they're historic monuments. And when the size<br/>
buldges into public works scale, the whole style seems to expand into<br/>
its natural universe. And Eric, it always amazes me that you take the<br/>
time to READ all the clues that get posted.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, yes, Resolution was our 100th letterbox! We had to do a little<br/>
fiddling and waiting to hit that milestone on the new year, but thought<br/>
it would be a fun family marker.<br/>

Thanks very much for this interesting strand! I didn't pursue your <br/>
query as Jay did, Erik, but if I had been further provoked, I think I <br/>
would have said India. One of my earliest and favorite children's <br/>
stories was Rikki-Tikki-Tavi from The Jungle Book. I can hear my <br/>
grandmother's voice now reading the first sentence to me:<br/>
<br/>
This is the story of the great war that Rikki-tikki-tavi fought <br/>
single-handed, through the bath-rooms of the big bungalow in Segowlee <br/>
cantonment.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Now, Erik, you've got me thinking. I always thought "bungalow" had<br/>
&gt; something to do with the military, but your question needed an<br/>
&gt; answer...so I went to the American Bungalow website. They say that the<br/>
&gt; word dates from the British colonial era in India, and the cool<br/>
&gt; spacious summer homes the expats moved to in the Himalayas. Now that's<br/>
&gt; fascinating! Jay<br/>

<br/>
My mail program split your URL address in two, Jay, because it was so <br/>
long.  So when I clicked on it, it only tried to load the top line <br/>
and I got an error message. In the end, I cut out the first part and <br/>
went to this address.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.ambungalow.com/<br/>
<br/>
Then I clicked on What is a Bungalow? on that home page. Just what <br/>
Jay did to find the answer himself. I put this up just in case any <br/>
else tried to find this siyte and got discouraged. <br/>

This bungalow thread makes me pine for those days in Pasadenda, CA<br/>
building movie sets in an old rose parade float house.  We would take<br/>
our lunches and drive around looking at all the Green Bros &amp; FLW<br/>
architecture on the Arroyo overlooking the Rose bowl.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few good examples of bungalows up here in the Pac NW, but it<br/>
seems our heyday was a decade or so earlier.  Most of the interesting<br/>
architecture tends to go more victorian.<br/>
<br/>
I was tempted once to buy a california bungalow in Monrovia, CA.  It had<br/>
a beautiful sweeping roofline... slightly suggesting that oriental<br/>
influence. A river rock fireplace with leaded glass built-in cabinetry<br/>
and lovely clinker-brick porch columns.<br/>
<br/>
Now 12 years later, here I am in Portland, living in a not-quite<br/>
sprawling ranch that can best be described as<br/>
"colonial-meets-Brady-Bunch."<br/>

ha!....  I have the new catalog on the floor right here!!  We have some<br/>
of the nice Mission style furniture they sell.  A VERY cool place.  The<br/>
other one here in town is called REJUVENATION.  They are partly salvage,<br/>
and partly new stuff.  They make their own line of period lighting and<br/>
also carry "Stickley" furniture.  Even more expensive than<br/>
Restoration... but a good place to go drool..... especially when they<br/>
have salvaged some nice concrete coping from an old school or<br/>
something.  They also produce a catalog &amp; you can find it advertised in<br/>
the back of some of the better bungalow magazines...<br/>

&gt; My mail program split your URL address in two, Jay, because it was so <br/>
&gt; long.  So when I clicked on it, it only tried to load the top line <br/>
&gt; and I got an error message. In the end, I cut out the first part and <br/>
&gt; went to this address.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.ambungalow.com/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I clicked on What is a Bungalow? on that home page. Just what <br/>
&gt; Jay did to find the answer himself. I put this up just in case any <br/>
&gt; else tried to find this siyte and got discouraged. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; the best "bungalow" book I've seen is "American Bungalow Style" by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Robert Winter - you'll likely recognize a few.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The park structures that referred to are at Beat Mountain Park in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hudson Valley - wonderful stuff!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And do you know the derivation of the term "Bungalow"?<br/>

time.  Last night, my husband and I walked the two miles to the Laurelhurst<br/>

commentary on houses, rating them on a scale of 1-10.  We were trying to<br/>
ascertain wether we like the same styles or not.  What we found was that the<br/>
Bungalows were what we both love! I honestly did not know what a Bungalow<br/>
was, and I kept asking him, "Well, what is the deffinition of Bungalow...and<br/>
what are intrinsic styles or designs a house must have in order to be called<br/>
a Bungalow" He wasn't sure.  Then today all this talk...Maybe it's not just<br/>
a coincidence ;)  Thanks for the enlightenment!<br/>

&gt; I was tempted once to buy a california bungalow in Monrovia, CA.  It had<br/>
&gt;  a beautiful sweeping roofline... slightly suggesting that oriental<br/>
&gt;  influence. A river rock fireplace with leaded glass built-in cabinetry<br/>
&gt;  and lovely clinker-brick porch columns.<br/>

Nice images, too bad that one got away...<br/>

Tom, Thom, and Jay are all correct - the India connection is correct and<br/>
from the British Empire days - local vernacular syle adapted by the<br/>
Brits. Of course, in this country, searching for new styles led to this<br/>
import for the sunny climate.  They used to be sold mail order by Sears<br/>
and Montgomery Ward.Of course, in addition to FLW, the Greene brothers<br/>
"ultimate bungalows" are not to be missed!<br/>
<br/>
A fun diversion, this.<br/>

Thom, I'm no architech, but I don't think that 60s house the Brady<br/>
Bunch lived in was either colonial or craftsman...definately hire Erik<br/>

Looking back at the index, I realize I'm being overly chatty here, so<br/>
I'm sorry to clutter your bandwidth, but I've been fascinated with our<br/>
discussion of bungalows and spent an evening at the library browsing<br/>
through old Sunset books. And with a little surfing found a picture of<br/>
the Pavillion at Rocky Neck Park that started me on this jag. It's not<br/>
close enough to really give you a feel for the expansiveness of it, but<br/>
worth a look-see. Jay<br/>
