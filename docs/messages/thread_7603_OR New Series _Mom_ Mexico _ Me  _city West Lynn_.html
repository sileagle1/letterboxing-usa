And you better not say anything negative about any of the cities, <br/>
customs, etc. out there in case somebody on this board is from <br/>
there and might feel personally offended if you expressed a poor <br/>
opinion about, well, uh, a poor opinion about anything Mexcian <br/>
because everyone knows they can't do anything wrong.  In fact, <br/>
you might even be considered racist if you suggest anything in <br/>
Mexico is something less than perfect.<br/>
