                    <div class="plaintext-content">*phew*  Just back from a long road trip - Denver to Phoenix and back <br/>
again.  While there were many letterboxes along the way - we only had <br/>
one day to spare, so we headed up to Sedona (one of the most <br/>
beautiful spots ... *sigh*) and trekked through the wilderness for <br/>
these three great boxes!  <br/>
<br/>
I've gotta say - I'm not in the best of hiking shape.  I don't know <br/>
why I didn't realize that Amanda (from Seattle)'s clue about 2 hours <br/>
worth of hiking would turn out to be closer to three hours for us!!  <br/>
I'm slow, and it was blazing hot.  We found the Chili Ristra in no <br/>
time, but the Pueblo took us longer.  By the time my weary legs <br/>
reached the Concho Belt, I thought I was going to die.  I was a bit <br/>
waterlogged, and sunburned to boot!  But it was a beautiful hike, and <br/>
the stamps are just ... well ... I'm stunned.  <br/>
<br/>
Eric was VERY proud of me for making it all the way to the third box, <br/>
and not complaining overmuch on the hike back to the car.  At the <br/>
third box we did upset a nest of mosquitos or something and we were <br/>
covered in bites that night.  <br/>
<br/>
Did I say I enjoyed the trip?  I feel like I'm complaining.  It was <br/>
lovely - Thank you Amanda for a wonderful trio of boxes and a <br/>
beautiful (if challenging for me) hike through the red rocks area!<br/>
<br/>
Happy to be back in Colorado!<br/>
