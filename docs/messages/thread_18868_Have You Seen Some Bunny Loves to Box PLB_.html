                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, I have searched high and low and sent out more personal emails than<br/>
I can count.  I really want to find this box!<br/>
<br/>
Last I heard (on 5/4) was that it was in Gresham OR with Twinkletoes. I<br/>
never heard if she mailed it out or not, and I have not gotten a<br/>
response to my emails I sent her.<br/>
<br/>
This box has NOT stuck to the order it was supposed to travel in, so I<br/>
don't have any clue who may have gotten it next - if it ever got<br/>
anywhere else.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I know:<br/>
<br/>
On 4/17 it arrived at Merenwen's in Gorham, ME.<br/>
Merenwen mailed it to Bookworm in Vancouver, WA.  <br/>
Bookworm got the box on 4/26.<br/>
While at Bookworm's there was a gathering so a few people could stamp in<br/>
Bookworm mailed it out on 5/3 to Twinkletoes.  <br/>
Twinkletoes got the box on 5/4.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have heard from a few people (Camp Fire Lady, Willow and Maiden<br/>
1974) - all of them have stamped into the box.<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard from Team Tired Feet and Jiggs - neither of them have<br/>
it... or have seen it yet.<br/>
<br/>
The list looks like this:<br/>
<br/>
Merenwen - Gorham, ME	<br/>
Bookworm - Vancouver, WA	<br/>
Willow - Vancouver, WA	<br/>
Camp Fire Lady - Battleground, WA	<br/>
Team Tired Feet - Eugene, OR	<br/>
Eric &amp; Yarissa in Wilsonville, OR	<br/>
Twinkletoes - Gresham, OR	<br/>
Maiden1974 - Gresham, OR	<br/>
Jiggs Yuba City, CA	<br/>
<br/>
Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue - Davis, CA<br/>
Dan in Eureka, CA<br/>
Katherine in San Jose, CA<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone PLEASE tell me where my box is!<br/>
