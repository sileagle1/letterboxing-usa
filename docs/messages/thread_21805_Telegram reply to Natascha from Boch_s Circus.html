&gt; Does anyone know a "Phineas Boch" ?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've received the following telegram by mistake and I'm trying to <br/>
&gt; forward to him:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; April 12, 2005<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Master Boch<br/>
&gt; The spirits have shown me your future, and in it I have seen a <br/>
&gt; beautiful Gypsy woman entering your life very soon. It is I, <br/>
&gt; Natascha! I, Madam Natascha, famed oracle, trusted confidant to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Spirit World, will soon be joining your entourage. I am enroute to <br/>
&gt; you now from my native Romania (or was it Czechoslovakia?).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In any event, I should be arriving in a very few days. I apologize <br/>
&gt; for such short notice, but I trust you will accommodate. I had to <br/>
&gt; hasten my arrangements. It seems the local authorities suspect I <br/>
&gt; played a role in the recent death of my husband. It is true that I <br/>
&gt; predicted his demise; a ghastly poisoning, but I only relay what <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; spirits show me. Mad? I curse the fools! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I miss dear sweet Alfredo. He was my seventh husband. Yes some<br/>
&gt; well... perhaps all of my husbands passed under mysterious <br/>
&gt; circumstances but why do they always assume it was by my hand? I <br/>
am <br/>
&gt; being driven from my native land because they fear I will stake my <br/>
&gt; royal claim! My Mother, Madam Zelda was also a great oracle.  The <br/>
&gt; fools confused her great talent for madness as well! She was a <br/>
wise <br/>
&gt; and powerful Gypsy who traveled all the World, providing guidance <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; the royal houses of Europe. She would not reveal the identity of <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; Father to me, that secret was buried with her, but she told me <br/>
once <br/>
&gt; that he was a son of the Czar himself. And this is why the <br/>
&gt; aristocracy unfairly accuses me now, persecute me! To keep me <br/>
&gt; silent! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Until we meet<br/>
&gt; Madam Natascha<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
