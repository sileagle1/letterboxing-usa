<p>May 28, 2001</p>
<p>On Friday evening my 
immediate family came over to celebrate my birthday.<span>  </span>We went to eat at the historic Sussex 
Inn in the middle of the town by the same name.<span>  </span>It was a very good meal and I got some 
nice gifts, including some money.<span>  
</span>However, the most enjoyable part was playing with my nephew Michael.<span>  </span></p>
<p><span>Some friends of 
mine went camping this weekend down in Cape May, New Jersey.<span>  </span>I joined them 2 years ago and we had a 
great weekend.<span>  </span>The best part was 
going to sunset beach and spreading out a blanket to watch the sun go down while 
sharing a pot of spaghetti and meatballs.<span>  
</span>I couldnt make it last year or this one and I really felt bad since they 
got rained on both times.<span>  </span>I had 
wanted to do some letterboxing and I set this weekend as a time to get 
started.<span>  </span>Being that my friends were 
getting soggy down in Cape May, I decided to Id go out in the rain as a way of 
being in solidarity with them.<span>  
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On Saturday 
morning I took my birthday money and bought myself a coated nylon rain suit and 
a new lensatic compass.<span>   </span>The 
compass I already have was from my forestry days and is marked in bearings 
instead of azimuths.<span>   </span>I 
decided to make the new one my official letterboxing compass and to store it in 
a special letterboxing pouch that I would assemble later.<span>   </span>My stamp and journal were in a 
ziplock plastic bag.<span>  
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p>Next I headed south 
on Route 23 to Mountain Side Reservation to find Wingfoots letterbox 
there.<span>  </span>The walk didnt take too 
long and I was able to stamp in rather quickly.<span>  </span>When I returned to the road I remembered 
that there was an artist supply store on 23.<span>  </span>I didnt care much for the spiral 
loose-leaf I was using for a journal and wanted to see if I could get a good 
hardcover bound sketchbook.<span>  </span>I 
hadnt been able to locate one that was small enough to carry.<span>  </span>The first store didnt have what I 
wanted and I ended up going further south down Route 23 to Staples were I found 
the perfect pouch for the job and a lined journal. </p>
<p>Then I took a u-turn 
and stopped in an arts and crafts store on the northbound side.<span>  </span>I was able to find sketchbook that I 
liked better there.<span>  </span>I just happened 
to browse in the next isle and to my surprise I found a rubberstamp carving kit 
complete with a slab of rubber, tracing paper, a wooden handle and 2 special 
carving blades.<span>  </span>Its made by 
Speedball; the same people who make pen and ink products.<span>  </span>Im already thinking about my next 
placement.<span>  </span></p>
<p>After that I picked 
up a sandwich from Blimpies and headed for another Wingfoot box in a park called 
The Tourne.<span>  </span>There was a covered 
picnic area there where I sat eating my sandwich as I arranged my pouch and read 
the clues. The walk up the mountain was relatively easy and I saw 4 deer and a 
wild turkey on the way.<span>  </span>The clues 
called to start following the compass directions from a bench at a viewpoint 
where you could see the Twin Towers at 110 degrees.<span>  </span>I knew right off that I was never going 
to see that far in the weather conditions that day.<span>  </span>However, as the trail spiraled up the 
mountain, I realized that the viewpoints were each facing in specific directions 
depending on where the trees were cut.<span>  
</span>When I found a lookout that faced 110 degrees, I followed the clues and 
found my reward quite readily. <span> </span>In 
less then 45 minutes I had returned from stamping in and headed for my next 
quarry.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Having picked up the 
two Wingfoot boxes so easily, I was lulled into a false sense of security.<span>  </span>I decided to head up to the Weis Ecology 
Center in Ringwood.<span>  </span>How hard could 
that be?<span>  </span>I pulled in at about 5pm 
and went to the visitor center to get a trail map.<span>  </span>All the literature was in the outside 
foyer and although the main building was closed an attendant came out to ask if 
there was anything he could help me with.<span>  
</span>I didnt mention anything about letterboxing, but just said I was looking 
for the blue trail.<span>  </span>He told me to 
walk up Snake Den Road along side the center and it was at the end.<span>  </span>As I walked up the road I met a local 
woman walking a dog and asked her to verify that the trail was in that 
direction.<span>  </span>After she explained how 
the trails come off the road she asked if I was coming out the same way.<span>  </span>There was something about the tone in 
her voice that didnt sit right with me.<span>  
</span>I guess she was wondering why anyone would be heading into the woods 
after 5pm on a rainy day.<span>  
</span></p>
<p>I guess I should have 
been wondering the same thing.<span>  
</span>Maybe I was just fooling myself.<span>  
</span>I was on a roll and didnt want to stop.<span>  </span>I refused to consider the possibility 
that this might be an extended hike.<span>  
</span>The clues said nothing about time or distance; only landmarks.<span>  </span>Since I wasnt familiar with this area I 
had no idea of how expansive the trail system was.<span>  </span>I knew it would be strenuous, but I 
didnt think it would be long, time wise.<span>  
</span>I guess I should have looked more closely at the map scale and the trail 
intersections that were mentioned in the clues.<span>  </span></p>
<p>The further I hiked 
the more it started to occur to me that this wasnt going to be a quick in and 
out job.<span>  </span>However, I still thought 
the destination was much closer than it actually was.<span>  </span>At about 5:45pm I decided to forge on 
not realizing that I wasnt even half way.<span>  
</span>By the time I realized it I was past the point of no return.<span>  </span>I finally reached the box at 7pm and 
stamped in.<span>  </span>The ecology center map 
showed other trails, but there were no contours shown to give me an idea of the 
terrain.<span>  </span>The clues had taken me by 
the scenic route over mountain peaks. Im sure the view was excellent on sunny 
days. <span> </span>If I could be sure that one 
of the more direct trails was relatively flat I might have chanced it and struck 
out for the Ecology Center.<span>  
</span>Unfortunately, I didnt have enough information to draw that 
conclusion.</p>
<p>I had already made 
one mistake that went against my better judgment by starting in so late.<span>  </span>I wasnt going to make another one.<span>  </span>The trail map showed that there was a 
parking area on a road about  a mile past the letterbox location.<span>  </span>The road was on the other side of the 
state forest, but I figured it was a lot safer to be on a road in the dark than 
in the middle of the woods.<span>  </span>After 
going back to the stream for a quick drink out of my hand I headed for the 
parking area.<span>  </span>Not long after that I 
found the needed trail intersection and headed down the last forested leg of my 
journey.<span>  </span></p>
<p>The trail was getting 
closer to the road and I could hear an occasional car go by.<span>  </span>After walking for a while parallel to 
the road, but a distance off, I looked ahead and saw a bear galloping along the 
trail in my direction.<span>  </span>He wasnt a 
very big one but Im sure his nails were still sharper than mine.<span>  </span>He hadnt seen me yet and when I gave a 
loud yell it startled him and he made a sudden right turn to disappear into the 
woods.<span>  </span>At this point I decided not 
to wait for the trail to hit the road and headed straight for it. </p>
<p>Now I was out of the 
woods but not exactly out of trouble.<span>  
</span>As I descended the last mountain I went through some thick mountain 
laurels, which saturated my legs and boots.<span>  </span>I hadnt worn the rain suit pants this 
time.<span>  </span>I figured I was going to get 
wet anyway, but I didnt expect to be out that long. <span> </span>The road route back to the Ecology Center 
was probably about 10 miles.<span>  </span>Cars 
were passing at a moderate rate and I tried unsuccessfully to thumb a ride as I 
walked along the road.<span>  </span>As soon as I 
had gotten out of the woods I called the Ecology Center on my Cell Phone and 
left a message on their answering machine.<span>  
</span><span> </span>I probably wouldnt be 
missed for another day or 2, but if the man I talked with saw my car he might 
have notified a search team.<span>  </span>I 
didnt want them needlessly searching in the woods while I was on the 
road.</p>
<p>I was between a rock 
and a hard place.<span>  </span>I wasnt in any 
immediate health danger, which would justify calling 911, but I wasnt looking 
forward to walking 10 miles in the dark and rain.<span>  </span>Further up the road I began to pass 
houses.<span>  </span>Most were dark since it was 
early in the evening and they were probably elsewhere for the holiday.<span>  </span>I got to an intersection with a closed 
gas station.<span>  </span>As I saw it in the 
distance I hoped that thered be a soda machine as I was really thirsty.<span>  </span>No such luck.<span>  </span></p>
<p>I started to see some 
houses with lights on and activity, but I still hoped to hitch a ride and didnt 
want to intrude.<span>  </span>There was one 
house with a lot of cars and an obvious party going on.<span>  </span>There were people sitting in the garage 
at the end of a long driveway drinking.<span>  
</span>A little girl saw me and came running down the driveway to greet me.<span>  </span>The mother screamed at her to come 
back.<span>  </span>I figured it wasnt a good 
time to ask for help and just smiled in their direction and kept walking up the 
road.<span>  </span>I cant imagine what I must 
have looked like trudging along soaking wet through the rain.<span>  </span></p>
<p>As I continued along 
the road I passed through a lake community.<span>  </span>There was a cabin with some lights on 
and the faint sound of rock music.<span>  
</span>The personalized address sign said Smokin Joes.<span>  </span>I decided to pass on that one too.<span>  </span>It was totally dark now and the road was 
narrow and dangerous, without much of a shoulder in some places.<span>  </span>A little further up the road I came to a 
contractors parking lot.<span>  </span>As I 
stood by the mailbox, I got an idea.<span>  
</span>Id call information and try to get a local taxi service.<span>  </span>I could give them the address on the 
mailbox.<span>  </span>They could pick me up and 
bring me to a MAC machine in town and then to my car.<span>  </span>That idea went out the door when I saw 
that my cell phone could no longer get reception.<span>  </span></p>
<p>I was beginning to 
wonder if I could get a ride easier if I collapsed on the side of the road 
instead of sticking out my thumb as cars went by.<span>  </span>Im not a very good actor and was 
determined not to let it get to the point where it was real.<span>  </span>As I continued up the road my legs 
started to cramp due to their soaked condition.<span>  </span>I knew that I couldnt stop for any long 
period of time as they would cramp so bad that I wouldnt be able to 
move.</p>
<p>I finally decided to 
seek help at a house.<span>  </span>There was no 
answer at the first one I tried.<span>  </span>I 
walk a little further up the road and came to a small white house.<span>  </span>As I knocked on the door, the dogs 
started barking.<span>  </span>A younger looking 
guy with a ponytail opened the door and gave me a stare.<span>  </span>I tried to explain my situation to him 
and where I needed to go.<span>  
</span></p>
<p>He seemed astounded 
at how far I had come.<span>  </span>Howd you 
get here? Snake Den Road is a long way off!<span>  </span></p>
<p>No 
kidding.</p>
<p>When I asked if he 
could just look up a taxi in the phonebook, he looked me in the eye and said, 
You aint a crazy man, are you?<span>  
</span></p>
<p>No, other than 
starting a 4 hour hike at 5pm in the rain, Im usually pretty sane.</p>
<p>Well then, Ill take 
you there. I was just about to go to town to pick up a pizza, 
anyway.</p>
<p>He went in to tell 
his wife (or girlfriend) where he was going and went out the back.<span>  </span>I stepped away from the door and saw him 
revving up a rather large 4-wheel drive bronco-type truck with a loud 
muffler.<span>  </span>He drove around the other 
side of the house and pulled right up so I was standing in the headlights.<span>  </span>He probably wanted a better look at 
me.<span>  </span>I walked to the passenger side 
and as I got in he stared rather uncomfortably at my new black letterboxing 
pouch.<span>  </span>It was then that I realized 
that it looked just the right size to hold a handgun.<span>  </span>Thats probably why no one stopped for 
me on the road.</p>
<p>As we drove along we 
started talking and I think he realized that I was safe.<span>  </span>He said his name was Elmer and he had 
just moved back to New Jersey after being gone since he was 19. <span> </span>We had been to some of the same states. 
<span> </span>I told him about letterboxing and 
how I ended up walking down his road.<span>  
</span>He said there was an old woods road behind his house that went straight 
to the Ecology Center.<span>  </span>I said that 
I didnt think it would be safe in the dark without a flashlight.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Yeah, he responded. 
Besides, Bobos been around.<span>  
</span></p>
<p>Whos 
Bobo?</p>
<p>A bear</p>
<p>Oh, bears. I know 
about them.</p>
<p>When we finally got 
to the car and said Id buy him a beer if I ever saw him in a bar.<span>  </span>He seemed like that type.<span>  </span>However, it didnt occur to me that I 
dont spend much time in bars myself now days; unless theyre attached to 
restaurants.<span>  </span>He told me not to 
worry about it and was on his way.<span>  
</span>I think Ill drop off something on his door next time I go down Otterhole 
Road.</p>

Wow, it sounds like you had quite an adventure.  The Weis Ecology <br/>
Center was the first letterbox I went searching for.  I too, didn't <br/>
calculate how far it was.    <br/>
<br/>
Also I was glad to hear that "Mountainside" and "The Tourne" are <br/>
getting more visitors.  I had originally planned to <br/>
plant "Mountainside" much deeper in the park.  However, along the <br/>
trail, I ran across a mauled deer skeleton which spooked me.  I <br/>
decided to spare folks that sight, so I planted the letterbox closer <br/>
to the entrance.  <br/>
<br/>
I just got back from planting a new series, those clues will be <br/>
posted shortly.<br/>
