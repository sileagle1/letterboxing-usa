are any letterboxes near by for which I could search?  Thanks.  Jody<br/>

&gt; I mail a lot of patches for my police and scout patch collecting. 2-3 patches can go in a business size letter w/ first class postage...  After that I would recommend the heavy 6x9 envelopes with  at least .55 to a $1 postage on them for the return...   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I will add my $.02  ..... Kay has put in a lot of work and effort on then patch project so be generous on the return postage on your envepole, so it doesn't cause her any more pain then necessary...<br/>

Jody, you are in for a TREAT! Go to the terrific Letterboxing North <br/>
America Web site http://www.letterboxing.org and click on the state <br/>
of Massachusetts. You will have a very busy time searching for all <br/>
those boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

If the number of messages from this list is higher then you prefer to <br/>

this will lump all of the day's mailing list messages into one message (per <br/>

Just FYI, it's best when posting a new box to start your subject with the <br/>
state abbrevation.  IE:<br/>
<br/>
     WA - New Seattle Box<br/>
<br/>
This lets people quickly brouse thru posts.  You want to have the state at <br/>
the beginning, so it doesnt get chopped in the subject line.<br/>
<br/>
Just a tip from someone still a bit damp behind the ears.  ;-)<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Hey there, good question on timing for uploads of box clues. I posted one with a mystery location a couple of weeks ago and I am not sure if it has been posted yet but then again I am not sure where they would post it as I did not indicate a state as it is a mystery...so where do we put those ones??? or should I give the state away?</p>

the Upstate NY countryside adding images to our log books. I don't know <br/>
where in Upstate you're based , I'm in the Rochester area, but you might <br/>
want to consider coming to the gathering in Gasport on 11/13 from 11 - 6 <br/>
pm. I'm certainly looking forward to it. While you're deciding on a <br/>
personal stamp, get out there and find boxes even if you have to hand <br/>
draw something in the log book. If you're in the Buffalo (Snyder) area <br/>
be sure to find "Faith, Hope &amp; Patience" It's a stamp lovingly carved <br/>
and the prayer request was not too much to ask.<br/>
Anyway, welcome to a fun sport. You're getting into it at a beautiful <br/>
time of year. I hope to see you on the 13th.<br/>

My idea is to collect my stamps on 3 1/2 X 5 index cards that I can <br/>
put in am album as opposed to carring around a journal with ALL <br/>
my "found" stampings in it... I would record info about the hunt, <br/>
date, location, etc. on the card next to the stamp... What is the <br/>
community thought on this?<br/>

<br/>
I stamp mine on 4x6 cards...and use 4x6 photo almums for my logbook.  not only do I make sure I get a "good first impression", I never run the risk of losing more than the stamps I have collected on that particular day...because when I get home I put them in my book.  I'll never lose my book, either, or accidentally drop it in the lake, or...whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
I have one photo album with two sleeves on each page I use for my logbook...I keep all plants, finds, exchanges, etc in it...and I can also put in 4x6 photos taken along the way.  I have another album that has one sleve per page...I use it for what I call my "proof set".  A copy of every stampo I ever carved is in there, in case I have to re-carve for some odd reason, I have the image.  (I put the image in the other ebook when it's planted, also)<br/>

You may be remembering a link that I think was on the map page that  said <br/>
"how many boxes in each state" or something to that affect. I think that  was <br/>
removed some time ago.<br/>

could be interesting, as maine is a big place, with a bit of <br/>

the tourists that give tourists a bad name :( with the four wheelers.<br/>
<br/>
if i can find time off from the pow wows, i'll have to try and look. <br/>
or maybe one will be near a pow wow. that really would be fun.<br/>

Geocaching.com has caches known as Letterbox-hybrids. These are<br/>
regular geocaches,(logbook and prizes) as well as letterboxes with a<br/>
separate book and a stamp. I've found several of these but they are<br/>
rarely listed o either AQ or LBNA.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">BTW, letterbox hybrids on geocaching.com do not have to include<br/>
trinkets. None of mine do. I prefer to omit trinkets because I think it<br/>
could confuse the finder and perhaps increase the chance that the stamp<br/>
gets taken inadvertently.<br/>
<br/>
BTW if you're interested in finding letterbox hybrids in your area go to<br/>
the advanced search page: http://www.geocaching.com/seek/nearest.aspx<br/>
On the "All Geocaches" drop menu, choose -Letterbox Hybrids<br/>
Then type in your postal code in the postal code box.<br/>
<br/>
Some letterbox hybrid hiders post the coordinates to the trailhead or<br/>
parking area and then give directions from there to the box, so a GPS<br/>
unit really isn't necessary.<br/>

&gt; Geocaching.com has caches known as Letterbox-hybrids. These are<br/>
&gt; regular geocaches,(logbook and prizes) as well as letterboxes with a<br/>
&gt; separate book and a stamp. I've found several of these but they are<br/>
&gt; rarely listed o either AQ or LBNA.<br/>
