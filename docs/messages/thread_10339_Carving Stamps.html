While everyone, except me,(I had to work) was in MA at the gathering, <br/>
I was thinking about letterboxing all day,and want to share (That "S" <br/>
word,lol) an easy way to transfer image onto rubber stamps. Use any <br/>
ink jet printer, set on black, and a HOT iron (just like making T-<br/>
Shirts). I use my engraving tool to carve with, it's just like a <br/>
Dremel only faster (400rpm), then use an X-acto blade to clean up the <br/>
rough edges. Hope this helps!<br/>

The part about the hot iron is certainly something I haven't tried. <br/>
Are you talking about printing onto plain paper, or something else?<br/>

to grayscale and print to plain paper.<br/>
The paper doesn't seem to matter as much as the ink intensity, more ink works<br/>
better.<br/>
Then I use an iron to transfer the image after applying a little moisture to the<br/>
back of the paper.<br/>
I use Staedtler Mars Plastic Erasers and Speedball - Speedy-Stamp material.<br/>
The above method works well on both surfaces.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I mentioned an HP printer is because a friend has an Epson and this<br/>
method doesn't work for him on the same material. There must be a difference in<br/>
ink.<br/>
I have used acetone and lacquer thinner to wet the paper for transfer on other<br/>
types of material when water didn't work.<br/>
<br/>
The real answer to this question is it takes trial and error to learn what works<br/>
for your printer and material, experiment.<br/>
<br/>
Trial n Error<br/>

I've got a question to ask, and I don't want to step on the unacceptable usse reules here... <br/>
<br/>
What I've been wondering is, is there was a call for inexpensive rubber stamps? I've been calling around checking on the prices of getting stamps made and they are, without a doubt, too expensive to do on a one off run.  However, the materials and such required to make them myself are not that bad and the price per stamp could be very low, as in the 2 dollar range, unmounted, 3 dollar mounted, for example.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, would something like this be used by the letterboxing community, or does everyone want to carve thier own?<br/>
<br/>
I apologize it this is off topic.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While a great many of boxers like to carve their own stamps, there are those<br/>
that have custom store bought stamps made.  You lose a little of being a<br/>
boxer, but it gets you out and about, and still are able to stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
I myself make my own stamps, but I use a laser.  While it is not hand done,<br/>
it is exactly the way I want it.  An advantage is I can do extremely<br/>
detailed art, and even halftones, with the laser.  Plus, the laserable stamp<br/>
material is very, very tough.  Not only that, but if a box goes<br/>
astray--knock on wood--I can easily replace the stamp.  I've done a few<br/>
personal stamps for local cachers that box as well.  One of my trade items<br/>
are coupons for free unmounted stamps, they seem to go over well.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, while I have done stamps for others, they have also<br/>
carved their own knowing I do stamps.  But, you see, that's perfectly okay<br/>
with me.  To each, their own.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you want to offer cheap stamps, it's fine by me.<br/>
<br/>
Now, OTOH, there will be purists on this forum who will claim that you must<br/>
crave your own stamps, but let them holler.  You have to bow to no one.<br/>

I took the great advice from many people on this list and my first one actually came out pretty good. Then I started on a few more..really just for the fun of it. They are very basic but I sorta like them. I'm not very artistic but I tried. I have a couple great ideas for more stamps and some really very cool places to plant them. I just have to get more carving material! No one locally has them so I am off to order online! <br/>
<br/>
I think this carving part may be more addictive than the actual letterboxing! :)<br/>
