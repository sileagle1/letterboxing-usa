<br/>
Sherlock Holmes, the Hound, and You<br/>
An adventure in three parts<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox Name: The Sherlock Holmes Trail Boxes (3)<br/>
Location: GA, Canton, Cherokee County,  at a Park<br/>
Difficulty: Requires some prior reading to get references, some cryptanalysis, some Compass work...relatively easy<br/>
Date Planted: August 11, 2002<br/>
Planted by: Jimmus and SpikesMom<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
To get on the road to the park, turn north on East Cherokee Drive at Macedonia Church. The Church is on GA Hwy 20 about <br/>
6 miles E of Canton.<br/>
<br/>
To find the name of the park and get other clues, you will need to refer to Sherlock Holmes' adventure "The Hound of the <br/>
Baskervilles" If you don't have a copy of this story readily available, you can go to the links below and download the Microsoft <br/>
Reader and the Ebook.<br/>

<br/>
First, You'll need to find the name of the Park that is your destination.<br/>
In the first chapter titled "Mr. Sherlock Holmes",<br/>
find the last name of the doctor who came to visit Holmes and Watson, the<br/>
doctor who had left his walking stick. Now assign an alphabet place number<br/>
to each letter of the doctor's last name. A=1, B=2, C=3. etc. to Z=26. For example, if the doctor's name were Smith, the <br/>
numbers would be 19,13,9,20,8.  Holmes used codes occasionally, and you have encoded Smith's name by simple <br/>
substitution.<br/>
Do the same for the doctor who visited, then add or subtract the following numbers to/from the encoded numbers of his name. <br/>
+7,-10,0,- 2,+16,-13,-5,-18.<br/>
Decode the resulting numbers to get the name of the park.<br/>
<br/>
When you arrive at the park, you will find a paved walking track that encircles the park. It is a nice trail with good walking.<br/>
Walk the path counterclockwise and use the following clues for<br/>
the three letterboxes:<br/>
<br/>
Box 1: Sherlock himself... <br/>
<br/>
In the chapter titled "Baskerville Hall", Holmes sends Dr. Watson and Sir Henry Baskerville on to the Hall while he stays in <br/>
London on business. When Sir Henry first sees the house, he is struck by the gloominess of the surroundings. He remarks that <br/>
inside of six months he will have some "structures" up.<br/>
<br/>
Walk downhill on the path and note that you lose sight of the rest of the park. You will only be able to see the tops of things <br/>
that function the same as those Sir Henry spoke of in his remark. Stop when the azimuths to the two nearest structures are <br/>
074 degrees and 178 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Walk a course of 350 degrees into the woods for about 50 paces to a yellow/white quartz stone about a foot across. From the <br/>
stone, the letterbox is at 083 degrees, about 10 paces. Some pine straw and branches may partially cover the box.<br/>
<br/>
Box 2: The Hunt Continues...<br/>
<br/>
In the chapter titled "The Man on the Tor", Dr. Watson meets Mr. Frankland who is notorious for filing lawsuits for almost <br/>
anything.  Frankland makes reference to one of his cases, "Frankland v. Morland, Court of Queen's ___". <br/>
<br/>
As you continue along the trail, stop at the structure that is identified with the same word that completes the quotation. From <br/>
the structure, proceed at 075 degrees for about 60 paces.  Look for the box among the stones, some stones partially covering <br/>
the box.<br/>
<br/>
Box 3: The Final Solution...<br/>
<br/>
Toward the end of the chapter "The Hound of the Baskervilles",<br/>
in the area on the Bog where "he kept his savage ally" a reference<br/>
is made to a "shaft half-filled with _____".<br/>
<br/>
As you leave the area of Box 2, walk along the path until you find a structure that serves the same purpose as the shaft. From <br/>
that structure walk into the woods on a course of 115 degrees for about 10 paces. A small pine tree will have information on <br/>
the back<br/>
of it that will direct you to the last letterbox which is partially covered<br/>
with pine straw and dead branches.<br/>
<br/>
We hope that this has been an enjoyable series of letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Please Note: The usual disclaimers apply:<br/>
You are responsible for your own safety. Do not trespass on private property.<br/>
Be aware of animals, plants, and environmental situations that might put<br/>
you, and others with you, in danger. It is a good policy to wear brightly<br/>
colored vests and caps in the woods during hunting seasons.<br/>
