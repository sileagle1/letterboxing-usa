Planted by Rubaduc 9-29-02 <br/>
<br/>
Easy walk:<br/>
This box is planted (at his favorite park) for my 5 year old letterboxing<br/>
grandson, Jared, who is stronger, faster and more energetic than any<br/>
raptor I ever met.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Rockwell Park: In Bristol, on Rt. 72 west go 0.6 mi. past<br/>
the Rt. 69 intersection, turning right onto Dutton Ave. park in front of<br/>
the playground.<br/>
<br/>
The usual routine of playing on the swings etc. comes first and then<br/>
follow the sidewalk north through the white gate and over the bridge,<br/>
turning left onto the fitness circuit. The large stone building straight<br/>
ahead of you when crossing the bridge once housed changing rooms and<br/>
concession stand when this was a swimming spot. Once on the gravel<br/>
circuit you'll see a good stamping in table on your left and a smaller<br/>
stone building ahead of you. Head towards this smaller building, making a<br/>
sharp right turn before coming to the steps going up the hill. At the<br/>
tree in the turn, count 18 steps and look to your left for a tree trunk<br/>
with a chunk of cement on top of it. Just behind it, under more cement<br/>
you will find Jared's hiding place. Being careful not to let Jared get a<br/>
piece of you, stamp in and rehide without being seen. This is a very<br/>
popular walking path, so be especially cautious. As you start to go<br/>
right, back to your car, look to your left and you'll see an old spring<br/>
house where people came from miles around to get fresh water. It closed<br/>
recently because of pollution.<br/>
