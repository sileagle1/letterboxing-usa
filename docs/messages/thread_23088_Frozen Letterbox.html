After walking  about 2.5 miles, it was about 15 degrees on top of<br/>
Mountain. Letterbox was in place but wrapped in frozen plastic bag and<br/>
decided not to open it up to check it out. Will be back to check it out<br/>
when the weather is warmer.<br/>

Best reason for wrapping your stamps in cloth or a piece of felt.<br/>
It not only absorbs the ink but protects the surface of the rubber and<br/>
eliminates the shredded paper bits that folks feel are so necessary to<br/>
include in a letterbox.  Think of it as a small investment into the<br/>
longevity of your lb.<br/>

beforehand all of the things that can go wrong with a letterbox.  I figure that if I keep <br/>
reading the boards, by the time I'm ready to place one I'll have worked out most of the <br/>
bugs.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, even as a finder, it will be useful to know what to put in my repair kit as well.<br/>
