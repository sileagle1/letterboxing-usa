<div>My long weekend started by a quick run for the last box at Fountain head where I picked up the unlucky hitchiker.  Then Thanksgiving Some elses star and I headed to the Ghost castel in arlington, after a short stop at my own box.  Ghost castel is a great box.  Its a fun little hike and I love the clues.  Friday was our buisest day we managed to make it to 9 different boxes. Frying Pan park, Furry woodland creature, Christmas grave Yard. where we pickedup a hitch hiker World domination and then we headed off and found Curtains up at Wolf Trap.  I almost rolled down the hill. It was so tempting but  little chilly.  Curtains up is a great stamp. After that we headed over to the dead authers which was great.  It was getting close to dark, But we managed to find all 5 of them and didn't even have to pull the flash light out of my bag.  Saturday I headed down to Summerduck and I found the Big dead tree.  It was pretty cool.  I made the mistake of going across the field in the wrong direction but even though I was walking threw brambles and found a pon the size of the dining room I did see to little deer that bounded in front of me.  Luckly I decided to try in the other and was rewareded.  It was a very pretty lake.</div>
