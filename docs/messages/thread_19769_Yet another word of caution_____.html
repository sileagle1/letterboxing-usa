                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello fellow boxers!<br/>
<br/>
I know that security while boxing has been brought up lately.  <br/>
Little did I know how timely all of that advice would be!<br/>
<br/>
My cousin and I went letterboxing in Massasoit State Park on Tuesday <br/>
afternoon.  We hit the trail, looking for TeamGreenDragon's "Des <br/>
Types A La Porte" LB series, at about 5:30 pm and got back to the <br/>
car around 7:15.  (All boxes were found in great condition. Anyone <br/>
going to look for these...be aware that TeamGreen was not kidding <br/>
when they talk about a "swampy area".  Right now, it's almost <br/>
impassable without getting soaked!)<br/>
<br/>
When we got back to the car, I noticed that my glove compartment was <br/>
open.  Weird, I thought, but not beyond the realm of possibility.  I <br/>
asked Deb if she had opened it.  She hadn't.  Since my CD player, <br/>
several CD's, and a few other items were still in the car, I didn't <br/>
think much of it.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, I went to get my back pack and fanny pack that I <br/>
use in my job as a summer camp counselor out of the trunk and they <br/>
weren't there.  I figured that I had just taken them in the house <br/>
and, since I was running late, I just went to work.  The search for <br/>
the missing bag extended well into last night to no avail.  Since I <br/>
am notorious for putting things in a "safe place" and never finding <br/>
them again, I just shrugged my shoulders and assumed I was going <br/>
insane.<br/>
<br/>
Until the Mass State Police called to tell me that they found my <br/>
bags in a dumpster in the park.<br/>
<br/>
I had to go to the barracks today to get my stuff back.  Lucky for <br/>
me, it's all there.  All I keep in the bags are extra clothes and <br/>
other camp-necessary things.<br/>
<br/>
I post this because I can't tell you how many times I've stuck my <br/>
pocketbook under the seat in a car when we go letterboxing.  Or how  <br/>
many times my cousin has left hers in my trunk.  We were lucky that <br/>
there wasn't anything like that in the trunk for those S#$%heads to <br/>
take!<br/>
<br/>
Moral of this long and rambling Public Service Announcement?  Be <br/>
careful what you leave in your car when charging after a box!  A <br/>
locked door doesn't mean you stuff is safe!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening....I'm still a little creeped out (and very <br/>
thankful)!<br/>

I do this ALL the time.  Having 3 kids, two of which are still very<br/>

and now I think I may have to make more of an effort and, to add another<br/>
