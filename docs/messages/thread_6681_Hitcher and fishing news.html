                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just picked up a couple of hitchers this past weekend: the Lonely <br/>
Goatherd at the Lion's Club and Centi-bration at Captain Gray. Had <br/>
some mass confusion with Fishing for Fun and Friends at Mansfield <br/>
Hollow on Saturday.  We had left it earlier at Opening Day and <br/>
Carolyn had moved it to Bass for the Mansfield Gathering, but by the <br/>
time we got there to stamp it in, Bill Haalck had already taken it <br/>
down to the Apple, where a hitcher "fish feeding frenzy" occurred - 8 <br/>
letterboxers in one spot with 3 boxes!  Now I am thinking that in the <br/>
ensuing hectic situation, perhaps the poor fish didn't managed to get <br/>
stamped for EITHER of the two boxes that it visited that day!  Oh <br/>
well, just wanted its owner, RIBNAG Ben, to know that it has indeed <br/>
visited both those places on the Kettle Hole Trail, and is now <br/>
apparently on its way yet again!  Unfortunately the other fish from <br/>
Maine (Ghoti) seems to have quite disappeared despite Carolyn's best <br/>
efforts to track it down by phone.  On the other hand, there is a <br/>
rumor floating around here that K-martha is now back on the East <br/>
Coast - sorry to disappoint you guys out in the Pacific Northwest!<br/>
