this letterbox (Confederate Cemetary, Fredericksburg, Va.) was doing <br/>
ok.<br/>
It's doing just fine, but....it seems to be a VERY popular box as the <br/>
stamp-book is filled. I had no spares with me.<br/>
IF THE OWNER OF THE BOX HAPPENS TO SEE THIS, THEY MAY WANT TO STOP BY <br/>
AND DROP OFF A NEW BOOK...but if anyone else thinks they'll be <br/>
visiting the box I suppose they could stick a new one in.<br/>
