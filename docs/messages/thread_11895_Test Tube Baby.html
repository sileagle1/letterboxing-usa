Directions: From RT.44 or RT.6 turn onto RT.198 and pull into the<br/>
Natchaug Forest drive over a bridge and up a winding hill pull into the<br/>
first parking area on the right and park.From here enter the trail and<br/>
you will soon come to a Y take a right and go down the hill to the<br/>
river.Follow the trail along the river and you will come to a stream<br/>
feeding into it,go up stream a little ways and you will cross over a<br/>
wooden bridge once,twice,three times.After the third bridge follow the<br/>
trail down to the river and continue on the trail by the rivers edge.In<br/>
a little while you will come to a big dead pine tree growing on the<br/>
rivers edge that splits into two sisters,just beyond that is a giant<br/>
white pine tree with a dead log behind it.In the end of that log behind<br/>
a wooden door is The Test Tube Baby Letterbox.(This stamp is meant as a<br/>
joke for when cloning goes bad.) Don't forget the clues for The Teddy<br/>
Bears Picnic &amp; #1 Teddy. For they are close by.The NeeDeeps  <br/>
