<br/>
I am new at this. A friend and I went to look for this letterbox.<br/>
We couldn't find it after a 1 1/2 hr search.  There are tons of logs <br/>
down in this place.  Who ever hid this box can you email me or anybody <br/>
who is familar with this one.  We need help.<br/>
<br/>
A little disappointed since this was our first search.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You<br/>

 From looking at the clues, I'd say that you should make sure you know how <br/>
many steps are in a pace and what an ash tree looks like....<br/>

Good luck!<br/>

Silent Doug - I don't know happystamping's qualifications, but we had <br/>
my dh as part of our team, and he TEACHES tree ID at the New York <br/>
Botanical Garden. He and son #1 fine-tuned their orienteering when <br/>
they qualified for Ground Search and Rescue with the Civil Air Patrol.<br/>
I think the box is really missing.<br/>

Sorry you missed this one. We found it on June 9th - took a little time, <br/>
though (especially tromping through the tall grass with the little ones). <br/>
If you tried after we were there and it's really gone, that's too bad. My <br/>
kids loved the slightly whimsical stamp.<br/>
<br/>
We were thinking of trying for the Endicott box next week.<br/>

I'm new to all of this - so I read the FAQ's before I did anything else.  They<br/>
imply that there is debate re: how long a pace is.  <br/>
<br/>
To quote the FAQ:<br/>
<br/>
"For what it's worth, even the dictionary is unclear as to whether a pace is<br/>
one or two steps. It goes on to define it in terms of various lengths of<br/>
measure (76cm, 5 English feet, 58.1 English inches), but I doubt any clue<br/>
writers are thinking along these lines (but who knows :-)). <br/>
<br/>
Finally, an informal survey was done on the LbNA talk list. 80% of those who<br/>
had an opinion felt a pace was the same as a single step, i.e., the footfall<br/>
of either foot, so you can use that if you have nothing else to go on, and as<br/>
a clue writer, it might make sense to use this as a default."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has this debate been settled?<br/>
