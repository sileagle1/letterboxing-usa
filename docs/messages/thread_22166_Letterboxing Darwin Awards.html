                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would like to pose this new topic of conversation to the group.  I assume that most of you have seen those emails that float around the country with the years "Darwin Awards".  Well, I know that I have done some pretty stupid things while letterboxing but thought it would lighten the mood to laugh at each other rather than some of the other things that have been going on here.  Now, I realize that to win one of the real Darwin Awards you acutally have to die in the act, however lets hope there are not any letterboxing deaths.  Therefore, nominate yourself or your boxing buddy by telling your story.  Will Lady Prisspot win?<br/>

postal letterbox to myself!<br/>
<br/>
Does it qualify if you realize that on the 3rd visit to find a<br/>
particular letterbox that the reason you couldn't find it the first 2<br/>
times was because you were standing on top of it? (this was after<br/>
e-mailing the placer and INSISTING that it could not POSSIBLY be there!)<br/>
<br/>
According to the directions I was in the EXACT spot... who knew it was<br/>
buried under almost a foot and a half of leaf debris.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our crew's darwin moment, aka The Hunt for Nankil'slas<br/>
<br/>
Our LCD, (Letterboxing Captain of the Day), planned a "big find day",<br/>
9 boxes in one day.  We had knocked out 6 when we began the the quest<br/>
for Nankil'slas, a 2 stamp series.<br/>
<br/>
The LCD grew up in the Nankil'slas area and was 100% positive she knew<br/>
where the mystery location was.  We spent a good 30 minutes at<br/>
debating whether there was a tree at 215 degrees or not.  Normally,<br/>
this is a simple decision for adults, but when you're boxing, it's<br/>
amazing how obvious facts of reality can be open for debate.  It<br/>
wasn't until "walking 50 paces" would have forced us to scale a<br/>
building that the LCD conceded we were in the wrong place, but that's<br/>
not too darwinian.<br/>
<br/>
We piled in the car and started to drive to the next box.  About block<br/>
down the road we passed another park, and the car errupted, "Here's<br/>
the place!"<br/>
<br/>
We quickly found the tree in question.  The initial clues were<br/>
hampered by some contruction going on, but we managed and were soon<br/>
hot on Nankil'slas' trail.  In twenty minutes we had found the first<br/>
Nankil'slas box.<br/>
<br/>
As we began to unpack it we heard somone coming down the trail.  We<br/>
scooped up the box and headed down the trail ahead of them.  Just<br/>
around the bend the trail split, we took the trail heading further<br/>
into the park and hoped the person would take the trail out of the<br/>
park.  We went a ways down the trail, stopped, and waited.<br/>
<br/>
It worked, the person didn't follow us.  We plopped down where we were<br/>
and stamped in.  After we were done, some one ran the box back to it's<br/>
proper location while the LCD began to read the clues to the next<br/>
Nankil'slas box, "At the next junction go west, look for a stump...."<br/>
<br/>
We had gone about 20 minutes looking for the "stump" when someone<br/>
suggested we may have missed it.  So we turned around to retrace our<br/>
steps.  We still didn't find the stump.  So we retraced our retraced<br/>
steps.  Still we didn't find the stump<br/>
<br/>
Remember this is our 7th box of the day.  It's getting dark.  One<br/>
member of the team is in open revolt.<br/>
<br/>
We decide we haven't missed the box yet and keep following the trail.<br/>
We quickly end up in parking lot next to the car.  Something is amiss.<br/>
 We retrace our steps again, and again, and again.  It's pitch black. <br/>
The open revolt has blossomed into a hostle string of obscenities,<br/>
resignation, demands for the car keys.  One boxer down, 3 to go.<br/>
<br/>
We notice the "trail" continues on the far side of the parking lot and<br/>
play field before heading off into another stand of woods.  The clues<br/>
don't mention several landmarks we'd have to negotiate to contine that<br/>
direction, but we decide it has to be path.  We cross the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen minutes later were back at the first spot, where we debated<br/>
where a tree was really at 215 degrees or not.  We retraced out steps<br/>
back to the car.<br/>

&gt; From the car we retrace back to the trail junction. Back to the car.<br/>
&gt; Back to the trail junction. Back to the car. Back to the trail<br/>
&gt; junction. Back to the car.  The scary part is every trip we find a <br/>
new<br/>
&gt; stump to investigate.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By now the obscenities are now longer streaming from the car and our<br/>
&gt; fellow boxer is sound asleep.  Out comes the mag lite.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Back to the trail junction. Back to the car.  Then it hits us.  Back<br/>
&gt; to the location of the first box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This time from the location of the first box, not our stamp in<br/>
&gt; location, the LCD reads, "At the next junction go west, look for a<br/>
&gt; stump...."  To escape the person on the trail we had already passed<br/>
&gt; the "next junction".  We had stamped in, by accident, at the exact<br/>
&gt; place where the 2nd box was located.   What should have be a hour <br/>
long<br/>
&gt; adventure took us 4.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Great stamp by the way.  You should try it sometime, I mean the box,<br/>
&gt; not the completely screwing up the clue part.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I won't bore you with the story about how we went after a box with a<br/>
&gt; clue that started with, "This box reported missing".<br/>

how when I was looking for Der Mad Stamper's Golden Spike LB I looked <br/>
for hours in a totally remote location only to realize (while on the <br/>
way home) that I was reading my compass backwards and the red arrow was <br/>
not lined up in the red section, but in the opposite side.  I drove <br/>
back (a 3-4 hour drive)one week later and found it fairly easily.  That <br/>
first trip was also my first LB encounter with a rattlesnake!<br/>
<br/>
Don, want to share any Butterfield Canyon experiences?  Although I take <br/>
partial credit for that one.  I couldn't conceive of someone trying <br/>
that and I didn't give fair warning in the clue. :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; suggested we may have missed it. So we turned around to retrace our<br/>
&gt; &gt; steps. We still didn't find the stump. So we retraced our retraced<br/>
&gt; &gt; steps. Still we didn't find the stump<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Remember this is our 7th box of the day. It's getting dark. One<br/>
&gt; &gt; member of the team is in open revolt.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We decide we haven't missed the box yet and keep following the <br/>
&gt; trail.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We quickly end up in parking lot next to the car. Something is <br/>
&gt; amiss.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We retrace our steps again, and again, and again. It's pitch <br/>
&gt; black. <br/>
&gt; &gt; The open revolt has blossomed into a hostle string of obscenities,<br/>
&gt; &gt; resignation, demands for the car keys. One boxer down, 3 to go.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We notice the "trail" continues on the far side of the parking lot <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; play field before heading off into another stand of woods. The <br/>
&gt; clues<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't mention several landmarks we'd have to negotiate to contine <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; direction, but we decide it has to be path. We cross the parking <br/>
&gt; lot.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fifteen minutes later were back at the first spot, where we debated<br/>
&gt; &gt; where a tree was really at 215 degrees or not. We retraced out <br/>
&gt; steps<br/>
&gt; &gt; back to the car.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; From the car we retrace back to the trail junction. Back to the car.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Back to the trail junction. Back to the car. Back to the trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; junction. Back to the car. The scary part is every trip we find a <br/>
&gt; new<br/>
&gt; &gt; stump to investigate.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; By now the obscenities are now longer streaming from the car and our<br/>
&gt; &gt; fellow boxer is sound asleep. Out comes the mag lite.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Back to the trail junction. Back to the car. Then it hits us. Back<br/>
&gt; &gt; to the location of the first box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This time from the location of the first box, not our stamp in<br/>
&gt; &gt; location, the LCD reads, "At the next junction go west, look for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; stump...." To escape the person on the trail we had already passed<br/>
&gt; &gt; the "next junction". We had stamped in, by accident, at the exact<br/>
&gt; &gt; place where the 2nd box was located. What should have be a hour <br/>
&gt; long<br/>
&gt; &gt; adventure took us 4.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Great stamp by the way. You should try it sometime, I mean the box,<br/>
&gt; &gt; not the completely screwing up the clue part.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I won't bore you with the story about how we went after a box with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; clue that started with, "This box reported missing".<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

Okay I'll step up and fess up. There is a hint of it on our profile <br/>
and Q&amp;A at Atlas Quest.<br/>
<br/>
We bought our first trailer in 2003 and decided to check out Idaho, <br/>
Wyoming, Montana and see the country, meet some letterboxers, do <br/>
some planting and finding. We did have the first ever Idaho <br/>
gathering at the KOA campground in Idaho Falls where we met Abear, <br/>
Jbear and Cadenza. Slight digression(Pulling a trailer isn't that <br/>
difficult as long as you are going forward, but when you don't know <br/>
what you are doing then backing up can be rather daunting, and there <br/>
is a learning curve.)<br/>
We had a great time sharing stories, exchanging, and getting some <br/>
info on the letterboxes we asked about. Unfortunately I failed to <br/>
ask about trailer access to Cadenza's Butterfield Canyon LB. At the <br/>
same time Cadenza figured that Don is smart enough to not even think <br/>
about that one while pulling the trailer. We take off collecting <br/>
various driveby boxes or those that have a good turnaround or <br/>
parking for trailers. Gwen spots the turnoff for Butterfield canyon <br/>
and up the canyon we go. Hooptedoo! on to another letterbox! Fairly <br/>
far into the canyon we both notice that the grade is getting very <br/>
severe, the road is narrowing, and turnouts are becoming rare. Gwen <br/>
spots a small turnout and asks if we should use it---nah, I can <br/>
handle it and decide to go a little further for the next turnout. <br/>
Now the grade is becoming even more severe, road narrower and I'm <br/>
stating to really sweat. Finally we come to a turn that is so sharp <br/>
our little 23ft trailer can not make the turn. There is but one <br/>
choice and that is to back down one of the most twisty, curvy, <br/>
narrow, mountain roads for 1/2 mile and not knowing how the heck to <br/>
do that. I previously had trouble backing 20 feet into a campground <br/>
area. We made it after several oversteers, restarts,and at one point <br/>
the gradient was so steep I couldn't reposition the rig as it didn't <br/>
have enough power to go forward up the hill. The heat guage was <br/>
pinned at the max, and I was afraid that the engine or tranny would <br/>
blow at any minute. We finally reached the turnout Gwen had asked <br/>
about previously, we got turned around and decided that it might be <br/>
a good idea to list this box as "almost attempted".<br/>
One of the first items we decided to add to our trailer supplies is <br/>
a pair of walky talkies, so there will be no more screaming.<br/>
Backing a trailer up is no longer a big deal. Heck I just ask "How <br/>
far do you want it?", and if Gwen ever asks about using a turn <br/>
around there is no question---we turn around.<br/>

Our crew's darwin moment, aka The Hunt for Nankil'slas<br/>
<br/>
Our LCD, (Letterboxing Captain of the Day), planned a "big find day",<br/>
9 boxes in one day.  We had knocked out 6 when we began the the quest<br/>
for Nankil'slas, a 2 stamp series.<br/>
<br/>
The LCD grew up in the Nankil'slas area and was 100% positive she knew<br/>
where the mystery location was.  We spent a good 30 minutes at<br/>
debating whether there was a tree at 215 degrees or not.  Normally,<br/>
this is a simple decision for adults, but when you're boxing, it's<br/>
amazing how obvious facts of reality can be open for debate.  It<br/>
wasn't until "walking 50 paces" would have forced us to scale a<br/>
building that the LCD conceded we were in the wrong place, but that's<br/>
not too darwinian.<br/>
<br/>
We piled in the car and started to drive to the next box.  About block<br/>
down the road we passed another park, and the car errupted, "Here's<br/>
the place!"<br/>
<br/>
We quickly found the tree in question.  The initial clues were<br/>
hampered by some contruction going on, but we managed and were soon<br/>
hot on Nankil'slas' trail.  In twenty minutes we had found the first<br/>
Nankil'slas box.<br/>
<br/>
As we began to unpack it we heard somone coming down the trail.  We<br/>
scooped up the box and headed down the trail ahead of them.  Just<br/>
around the bend the trail split, we took the trail heading further<br/>
into the park and hoped the person would take the trail out of the<br/>
park.  We went a ways down the trail, stopped, and waited.<br/>
<br/>
It worked, the person didn't follow us.  We plopped down where we were<br/>
and stamped in.  After we were done, some one ran the box back to it's<br/>
proper location while the LCD began to read the clues to the next<br/>
Nankil'slas box, "At the next junction go west, look for a stump...."<br/>
<br/>
We had gone about 20 minutes looking for the "stump" when someone<br/>
suggested we may have missed it.  So we turned around to retrace our<br/>
steps.  We still didn't find the stump.  So we retraced our retraced<br/>
steps.  Still we didn't find the stump<br/>
<br/>
Remember this is our 7th box of the day.  It's getting dark.  One<br/>
member of the team is in open revolt.<br/>
<br/>
We decide we haven't missed the box yet and keep following the trail.<br/>
We quickly end up in parking lot next to the car.  Something is amiss.<br/>
 We retrace our steps again, and again, and again.  It's pitch black.<br/>
The open revolt has blossomed into a hostle string of obscenities,<br/>
resignation, demands for the car keys.  One boxer down, 3 to go.<br/>
<br/>
We notice the "trail" continues on the far side of the parking lot and<br/>
play field before heading off into another stand of woods.  The clues<br/>
don't mention several landmarks we'd have to negotiate to contine that<br/>
direction, but we decide it has to be path.  We cross the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen minutes later were back at the first spot, where we debated<br/>
where a tree was really at 215 degrees or not.  We retraced out steps<br/>
back to the car.<br/>

b/c they didn't feel it would be rig friendly.  Well that place had <br/>
paved roads and a large parking lot, so I assumed they wouldn't go for <br/>
the one right next to it in a much smaller, winding, bumpy, dirt road.  <br/>

<br/>
My friend and I had planned a weekend letterboxing trip along the <br/>
Mississippi river and had reserved a camping site at a great park.  <br/>
We had everything planned out and were really excited.  So the end <br/>
of the week rolled around and every weather report was <br/>
forecasting "severe" storms in the exact area that we were heading <br/>
towards.  But being the letterboxing adventurers that we are, we <br/>
said "screw it" and headed out anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Our first day was beautiful and we only hit one tiny patch of rain, <br/>
the rest of the day being completely beautiful and sunny.  We got to <br/>
our campgrounds, and the last letterbox planned for the day just <br/>
happened to be right near our campsite.  As we found the letterbox, <br/>
the clouds started rolling in and we got a little sprinkling of <br/>
rain.  We headed back to the campsite and decided to get the fire <br/>
started before we set up the tent just in case it started raining <br/>
again.  So H.K. started getting the fire started while I unpacked <br/>
the car to get the tent set up.  I'm not the camping guru that H.K. <br/>
is, so I was confused when I couldn't figure out which pack the tent <br/>
was in.  I finally decided to give up and just ask, when H.K. turned <br/>
and looked at me with her mouth open and a horrified look on <br/>
her face.  I'm like, "No way".  And she says, "I forgot to pack the <br/>
tent".  So we had the air mattress, the sleeping bags, the delicious <br/>
campfire meal, a potential storm rolling in, and no tent. <br/>
<br/>
We checked out all our options; sleeping in the rain, sleeping in <br/>
the car . . . that's about it.  Luckily, my car happens to have an <br/>
enourmous trunk.  So we folded the back seats down, blew up the air <br/>
mattress in the trunk and spent the night sleeping in the car with <br/>
our legs in the trunk and our heads sticking out the back seats.  It <br/>
wasn't the most comfy way to camp, but it's nice to know that you <br/>
can sleep relatively comfortably in your car if you need to.<br/>
<br/>
PS) It never ended up raining.<br/>
