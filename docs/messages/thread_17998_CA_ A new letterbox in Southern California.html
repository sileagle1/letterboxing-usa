Placed by: Buzzard   (contact the placer)<br/>
Placement date: Feb 29 2004<br/>
State: California<br/>
County: Los Angeles <br/>
Nearest city: Pasadena<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
This is practically a "drive-by" letterbox. The walk is less than <br/>
1/4th mile, and easy for small children and dogs on a leash. You have <br/>
to walk on grass part of the way, so I guess it's not stroller-<br/>
friendly. (I've never pushed a baby stroller; can they be rolled on <br/>
baseball diamond-style grass? If so, than this LB is stroller-<br/>
friendly.) <br/>
<br/>
The box is located at Victory Park in Pasadena, California. The <br/>
park's address is 2575 Paloma Street, Pasadena, CA, 91107. <br/>
<br/>
Directions traveling west: Take the West 210 Freeway to Pasadena and <br/>
exit on Sierra Madre Blvd./San Marino. Turn slight left onto Maple <br/>
Street. Take Maple a few blocks to Altadena Drive. Turn right on <br/>
North Altadena Drive for .4 mile to Victory Park (which is located on <br/>
the right side of the road). Continue north on Altadena Drive another <br/>
block until you reach the park's west parking lot, and park here.<br/>
<br/>
Directions traveling east: Take the East 210 Freeway to Pasadena and <br/>
exit on Sierra Madre Blvd./Altadena Drive. Stay straight to go onto <br/>
Corson Street for one block to Altadena Drive. Turn left onto North <br/>
Altadena Drive for .4 mile to Victory Park (which is located on the <br/>
right side of the road). Continue north on Altadena Drive another <br/>
block until you reach the park's west parking lot, and park here.<br/>
<br/>
Begin your search from the park's west parking lot. From the lot, <br/>
head north until you reach the asphalt path that borders the chain-<br/>
link fence that surrounds the track field. Follow the asphalt path <br/>
east into the park, walking next to the chain-link fence until you <br/>
find the "green cage" located near where the path forks. At a <br/>
direction of 70 degrees from the green cage, you'll see a tree about <br/>
75 feet away that borders the track field situated above it. This is <br/>
tree Number 1, about 50 feet further on from this tree is tree Number <br/>
2. Find tree Number 6. About 12 feet north of the sixth tree, under a <br/>
root that is visible on the side of a short hill, and behind some <br/>
ivy, is the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Please be careful reaching into dark places, and discreet re-hiding <br/>
the box, since someone may be playing soccer or baseball nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Before you set out, please read the lettrboxing waiver of <br/>
responsibility and disclaimer. <br/>
