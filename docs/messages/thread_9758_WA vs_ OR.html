neighbors to the north... does this mean Ryan, Paisley Orca and I<br/>
should pull the boxes we''ve placed in Washington? But then again,<br/>
maybe they are cancelled out by those hidden in our fair state by the<br/>
Nail Family, Fudrick, Amanda and Eliza B. But then again, whose<br/>
counting? Funhog<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hey, Washingtonians---I think we're making headway on Oregon...  ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We might make it into the top 10 within a few days at this rate <br/>
&gt; (provided Ryan stays in CA for a bit and Funhog is on the road)!  :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See you on the trails...<br/>
