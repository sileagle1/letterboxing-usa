Location: Redmond Washington <br/>
County: King<br/>
Placed : 02/01/03    By Hoopoe  <br/>
<br/>
Farrel-McWhirter is a fun little park north east of Downtown Redmond <br/>
WA.  There is a small family farm with animals present year round.  <br/>
There are large open grass lawns and plenty of picnic areas.  A small <br/>
bridle trail circles the park and there are two community rings on <br/>
the north end.  Mackey creek runs in two branches through the park <br/>
and some areas can be somewhat soggy.  The mix of habitat offers good <br/>
bird watching potential.  There is a permanent Orienteering "trim" <br/>
course in the park.  Information about all of the organized <br/>
activities and the orienteering course are available from the City of <br/>
Redmond Parks Department.<br/>

Directions:<br/>
Take Highway 520 east from 405 or its junction with I-5 in Seattle to <br/>
its eastern terminus.  Keep in the left lane (Avondale Rd exit) and <br/>
the road will empty out into the surface streets to become Avondale <br/>
Road.  Continue northbound. Turn right in 1.25 miles onto Novelty <br/>
Hill Road. In about 2 blocks, turn left onto NE Redmond Rd.  Turn <br/>
left into the park after the road bends left.<br/>
<br/>
The Redmond Watershed boxes are about 1 mile further east on Novelty <br/>
Hill Road and these two venues would provide a full day of Boxing.  <br/>
Bridle Trails SP and St Edwards SP are to the west along I 405.  Each <br/>
offers multiple boxes to try.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: <br/>
Medium difficulty, beginners might be challenged.  Hike modest to <br/>
moderate.  A few hills.  Distance about 1.25 miles.  Good for most <br/>
able folks.  Great for family.<br/>
<br/>
To the boxes:<br/>
Head to the far, 280* end of the parking lot.<br/>
Take the trail with three guardians that heads 250*<br/>
T-left, T-right.<br/>
Swing right to the service road.  Keep heading 0* to the bridge in <br/>
the distance.<br/>
Go into the woods and take 10* uphill.<br/>
Soon on the left two old nurses.  Go ask the 2nd one to tell a tale.<br/>
<br/>
Continue to climb.<br/>
"T" right and go to see Mackey and his bridge.<br/>
On the far side, on the right a buttress cedar trunk holds a quiet <br/>
secret.  Look carefully for he won't pipe up.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on main trail.  Cross the quiet stream and go left.<br/>
Hit the pavement, say "Hi" to the bunnies and chickens.<br/>
Keep the pony ring fence to your right and pick up the trail near the <br/>
diamonds.<br/>
Track right.<br/>
Cross the road.  Five Jay on the left will not make a sound but you <br/>
can count on them<br/>
 + 48 to "conker" this course.<br/>
<br/>
Return to the parking lot by continuing on and taking all the right <br/>
options, or backtrack to the road you recently crossed and walk in <br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>
As usual please be discreet and careful when finding.  This is a busy <br/>
park.<br/>
