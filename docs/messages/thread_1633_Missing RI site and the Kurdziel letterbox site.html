been working for at least a week or more.  We tried to pull them up <br/>
for last weekend and weren't able to.  I hope that they can be found <br/>
as we would like to hike that area.<br/>
<br/>
I finally built a website for the clues for our Magic Tree House <br/>
series.  It can be found at:<br/>

It is rough but maybe over the holiday break...  We just have the <br/>
Dinosaurs before Dark (Westwoods) and our hitchhiker listed but are <br/>
planning on planting the next two in the series at the Fisherville <br/>
Brook Audobon Refuge (Exeter, RI) this weekend.<br/>

are still in the field, even though they seem to be "off" the <br/>
Tonamets website. I think I'll run back to the Chamber of Commerce <br/>
site: I seem to recall that the owners left their postal address in <br/>
that box. Unfortunately, I didn't save my "hard" copies of the clues, <br/>
or I would offer to post them to you for this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone else save their printed copies of these wonderful <br/>
letterboxes? Melissa and Dan maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and good luck! Jay in CT<br/>

Yes!  We do have our printed copies of all the Green Trail Quests.  I could<br/>
send them to you guys if you would like.  Also, if you can get to the<br/>
Charleston Chamber of Commerce sometime during the week the clues are<br/>
available there.<br/>
<br/>
We were unable to find the Frosty Drew Quest, and the Welcome Quest can only<br/>
be completed when the Chamber of Commerce is open.  We were able to find the<br/>
Trustom Pond Quest (lots of fun, a great place) and Polly's Rock.  We<br/>
haven't been out looking for the others yet.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would like a copy let us know and we could send in the clues.<br/>

Thanks for the clue sheet for Trustom Pond Quest.  We finally made it <br/>
on New Year's Day.  Traditionally we do Green Falls but we weren't <br/>
sure of the footing with all the snow.  It was gorgeous in <br/>
Charlestown by the water but it definitely was icy.<br/>
<br/>
We gathered up the neighborhood kids (but not their parental slugs) <br/>
and took everyone to Trustom.  The kids loved it and I think we have <br/>
more converts.  The clue sheet really inspired my husband and I.  We <br/>
have been thinking of doing some "puzzle" letterboxes anyway and were <br/>
brainstorming all last night.  I don't think that I am up to the <br/>
creativity of the Quest box, however, but I will start working on it..<br/>
<br/>
Cheers from snowy RI (and hoping that there will be more on the way <br/>
soon), <br/>

    So glad that someone could use those clues!!<br/>
    Dan and I went out on Sunday and found all four of your new boxes!  We<br/>
loved them.  We were amazed how "in sync" your locations and clues were.<br/>
The dinosaur rock location was awesome!!!  We felt so tiny in there.  Also,<br/>
the 3 sarcophogi for the mummy was great.  Excellent carving too, terrific<br/>
stamps.<br/>
    Looking forward to more Kurdziel family letterboxes in the Magic<br/>
Treehouse Series.<br/>

P.S.- We found your hitchhiker at Westwoods a few weeks ago.  Finally after<br/>
a couple crazy non-letterboxing weeks, we have dropped it off at a new<br/>
location that we visited over Christmas break.<br/>
