<br/>
Planted 4/9/01 by Leader of the Pack and the Cowboy  for Grandma's <br/>
birthday.<br/>
<br/>
Rated : Easy<br/>
<br/>
Note: This is on the Trail to Inherit the Earth<br/>
<br/>
Begin on Rte 195 in Mansfield , south of the  the Ucon Campus. Look <br/>
for the Mansfield Historical Society ( Old Town Hall ) and pull in to <br/>
the parking area. Park to the very back of the lot. Here begins a <br/>
walk into the past.   " Mary , Mary where you going?"  " Into the <br/>
lane for a walk, I'm looking for some of the plants I need to dye my <br/>
yarn into beautiful colors. If you want to come along you may.  "<br/>
The two girls walked north a bit they passed the Osage orange tree, <br/>
its fruit though not edible were a nobby green orb and interesting to <br/>
look at ,the trees are rather rare and  it was nice one was so close <br/>
by.  They scampered over the wall and turned right onto the dirt <br/>
road.  They walked along scanning the woodland for  dye plants whose <br/>
leaves and roots would give color to the wool they had spun into <br/>
yarn. The stonewall of the lane was on the left and they walked along <br/>
chattering about the pattern for a magnificent Bed Rug. A  bed <br/>
covering popular in these parts in this wonderful era of the mid <br/>
1800's. They gathered a few roots and walked more ,happy to  be out <br/>
on a nice day and away from the hot kitchen fire and the chores at <br/>
home. Soon they heard whispers, it was the boys in their tree house <br/>
laying some plot of torment saved especially for sisters. They would <br/>
fool them. " Mary why did mother bake such fine cakes today?" With <br/>
the thought  of food the boys climbed down the rustic ladder and ran <br/>
for the kitchen at home. Would they ever be suprised to find mother <br/>
making soap! The girls giggled at their very fine prank and walked on <br/>
past the tree house. Soon they came upon a place where several stone <br/>
walls met. The trail would go down hill here but they  stopped and <br/>
looked the area over. There to the left of the trail were two large <br/>
trees very similar in size and right next to each other. Between the <br/>
trees hidden by rock were the very roots the girls sought.  They were <br/>
careful to not have anyone see them there and got what they came for <br/>
and left the rest for someone else tucked in to the rocks as they <br/>
found it.  At home they would dye yarn  and sew it into a design so <br/>
grand it would make their  room look elegant!  They returned home the <br/>
way they came. Maybe another day they would walk on to Inherit the <br/>
Earth a popular view spot where most of the valley of Mansfield would <br/>
be layed out before them . For today it was home to get the dye pot <br/>
boiling and the project underway again.           CONGRATULATIONS to <br/>
my Mom for the publication of her book on Bed Rugs a special colonial <br/>
art and for the hours she put in making her own!  Carolyn - Leader of <br/>
the Pack<br/>
