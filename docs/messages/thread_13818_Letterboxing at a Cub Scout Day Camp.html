                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've just discovered your secret of letterboxing, so I'm totally new <br/>
at this.  I'm also a Cub Scout Day Camp Program Coordinator for the <br/>
last 5 years.  I had a brilliant idea last night to add a <br/>
letterboxing exercise into my program for the cubs between their <br/>
stations.  I think I know what to do as far a box.  I'll do what you <br/>
do with rubber stamps and pads, etc. and give out clues everyday for <br/>
a new box (4 days of camp).  But for camp I'll be adding the scouting <br/>
element by adding a info on a specific knot. If they find the box, <br/>
they will know what knot to demonstrate for me later in the day for <br/>
another special prize!  They will also be learning the compass for <br/>
two days, some of the clues can use the compass directions too.  <br/>
(gotta get the scouting thing in there too!)<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure that no one at camp knows about letterboxing at all.  I'd <br/>
like to take this opportunity to tell them about it.  I've read where <br/>
there's an intro sheet out there.  Where could I find that?  Or could <br/>
someone write me up a one brief sheet explaination about the hobby <br/>
and how it works and where to go to get more info.  I have 200 cubs <br/>
at camp, and their parents.  I bet some of them might continue this <br/>
for real.  I'm just too new to this myself, I wouldn't know what I <br/>
need to tell them about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, how exactly does the Hitchhiker letterbox work?  I might try to <br/>
incorporate that into the program as well.  Perhaps encourage the <br/>
dens to hide their own letterbox or Hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your patience and your help!<br/>

<br/>
To get written info about LBing, go to the website (www.letterboxing.org) and click on "Getting Started" or "FAQ" or "Kids."  You could also use a copy of a newspaper article, like the one from the LA paper that James recently posted a link to.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, there's a PNW letterboxing list-serve--do you know about that?  <br/>
