<p>Planted 4/9/01 by Leader of the Pack and the Cowboy for Grandma's
      birthday. Rated : Easy Note: This is on the Trail to Inherit the Earth
      Begin on Rte 195 in Mansfield , south of the the Ucon Campus. Look for the
      Mansfield Historical Society ( Old Town Hall ) and pull in to the parking
      area. Park to the very back of the lot. Here begins a walk into the past.
      " Mary , Mary where you going?" " Into the lane for a walk,
      I'm looking for some of the plants I need to dye my yarn into beautiful
      colors. If you want to come along you may. " The two girls walked
      north a bit they passed the Osage orange tree, its fruit though not edible
      were a nobby green orb and interesting to look at ,the trees are rather
      rare and it was nice one was so close by. They scampered over the wall and
      turned right onto the dirt road. They walked along scanning the woodland
      for dye plants whose leaves and roots would give color to the wool they
      had spun into yarn. The stonewall of the lane was on the left and they
      walked along chattering about the pattern for a magnificent Bed Rug. A bed
      covering popular in these parts in this wonderful era of the mid 1800's.
      They gathered a few roots and walked more ,happy to be out on a nice day
      and away from the hot kitchen fire and the chores at home. Soon they heard
      whispers, it was the boys in their tree house laying some plot of torment
      saved especially for sisters. They would fool them. " Mary why did
      mother bake such fine cakes today?" With the thought of food the boys
      climbed down the rustic ladder and ran for the kitchen at home. Would they
      ever be suprised to find mother making soap! The girls giggled at their
      very fine prank and walked on past the tree house. Soon they came upon a
      place where several stone walls met. The trail would go down hill here but
      they stopped and looked the area over. There to the left of the trail were
      two large trees very similar in size and right next to each other. Between
      the trees hidden by rock were the very roots the girls sought. They were
      careful to not have anyone see them there and got what they came for and
      left the rest for someone else tucked in to the rocks as they found it. At
      home they would dye yarn and sew it into a design so grand it would make
      their room look elegant! They returned home the way they came. Maybe
      another day they would walk on to Inherit the Earth a popular view spot
      where most of the valley of Mansfield would be layed out before them . For
      today it was home to get the dye pot boiling and the project underway
      again. CONGRATULATIONS to my Mom for the publication of her book on Bed
      Rugs a special colonial art and for the hours she put in making her own!
