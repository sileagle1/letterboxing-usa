indoors, in libraries and retail stores and such, could I make a <br/>
small suggestion?  Please include in your clue the days and <br/>
times when the location is open.<br/>
<br/>
On Saturday I drove about 45 minutes to find a box that is hidden <br/>
in a rubber stamp store.  (Neat idea, huh?)  But when I got there, <br/>
I discovered the store is closed on weekends.<br/>
<br/>
I know I could have called ahead--but who would think that a <br/>
retail store on Main Street would not be open on a Saturday <br/>
afternoon? Had the store hours been noted in the clue, I would <br/>
have known better.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a suggestion. Happy winter boxing everyone--<br/>

P.S. To Team Green Dragon:  Wow, what a fabulous carving!<br/>

Of course, even if the hours were posted with the clues, there is no<br/>
guarantee that they wouldn't change unexpectedly, so  it would be worthwhile<br/>
to double check anyhow--especially for museums and small crafty type places<br/>
that are owner-operated or staffed by volunteers etc.<br/>
<br/>
And as a reminder, many parks are subject ot the whim of the weather at thsi<br/>
time of year, so checking on trail conditions (and even accessibility)<br/>
becomes more important as well.<br/>
