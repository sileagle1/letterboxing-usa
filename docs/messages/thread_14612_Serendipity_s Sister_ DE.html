so far, I've come up with nothing. The first clue is that it's in <br/>
the "first county in the first state". I know where that is, but <br/>
have only figured out one other clue, which hasn't been much help. <br/>
Has anyone else found this box, and if so, how difficult is it to <br/>
figure out the clues? It seems to be pretty easy, once you know <br/>
where to go. <br/>
We're hoping to move west soon, and wanted to find as many boxes as <br/>
possible in DE before moving. If anyone has any additional clues, <br/>
I'd really appreciate them. You can email me offlist at <br/>
