                    <html><body><p>I do not know of any intact letterboxes in the eastern Adirondacks. The Adirondack Park, with all its public lands and trails seems to be a wonderful place for placing letterboxes. I am very familiar with the far western boundary area (east of the Black River in Lewis County) of the Park and plan to place at least three seasonal boxes (~May 1 - ~October 31) over the summer. I am calling these seasonal because of the harsh winters that keep snow in the woods often until May 1 and because, after the end of October, hunting season is in full swing and there are safety concerns. 
</p><p>Though I now live in Connecticut, my family lives just inside the Adirondack Park's western boundary, so I will use my upcoming visits there to place some boxes in some of my most favorite places. Please look for clues for these boxes on the LBNA site within the next few weeks. 
</p><p>I also recently submitted a free-lance article on letterboxing to one of the weekly newspapers that serves the above-referenced region, though I have not been notified of its publication. I was hoping to generate some interest in this wonderful hobby in the region so that others might get out there and place some boxes. There are many lakes and state parks that draw weekenders who, I felt, would enjoy letterboxing as a family activity. We who have already discovered how much fun this is just need to get the word and the boxes out.

My mother has in mind a few places for a box or two<br/>

can do to get more out there.<br/>

                    <html><body><p> Hi A.D.,
</p><p>I submitted my article to the Adirondack Mountain Sun in Lowville, NY. For a list of newspapers published in NY State, check out: <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp">http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp</a>  You may find one or more near where your parents live in the eastern part of the Adirondacks. There seems to be more small weekly papers published there than any daily ones.  Most of these are on the stands on Thursday in order to be "fresh" for the many people who weekend there. 
</p><p>Sounds like you and your parents are interested in  the eastern part of the Adirondacks. I am trying to get something going in the western part. Now, all we need is an avid letterboxer or two in the middle!  I did notice with interest that there are over 600 geocaching sites in NYS, many in the central and northern NY area. Like you, I am surprised that letterboxing has not caught on in such a scenic area with so much public use land.
</p><p>With regard to stamps, (though I may get drawn and quartered by the purists for suggesting this), if hand carving a stamp is not possible for your mom, there are many beautiful ready-made ones out there she could use to symbolize the site of the letterbox. I am not very artistically inclined myself, but did invest in a couple of erasers and an x-acto knife to see how I would do. Crude results at this point, but I still have all my fingers,and there is still some motivation to keep trying until I get something that actually resembles what was in my head.
</p><p>Good luck

 I pass through Lowville each summer as I drive our State FFA <br/>
officers to  Camp Oswegatchie outside Lowville. I did two wonderful <br/>
boxes in Syracuse, SaltMine56 and across the street at the Indian <br/>
Muesam , Saint marie among the iroquios  , that was great fun as the <br/>
interprreters stay " in character". <br/>
   I planted Pennies from Heaven on the Colgate Campus Hamilton Ny <br/>
and  at Rogers Park I have one called Big Dipper that is in <br/>
Sherburne.  If I get asked to drive again this year maybe I will <br/>
leave a couple more. I will surely look for a couple more!  Leader of <br/>
