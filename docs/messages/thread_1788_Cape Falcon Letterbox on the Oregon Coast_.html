<br/>
Thanks to a beautiful, clear, sunny 60-degree day on the Oregon <br/>
Coast, the Cape Falcon letterbox was placed by Amanda Briles (The <br/>
Paisley Orca) and John on 1/22/2001.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  This letterbox is located at Oswald West State Park.  <br/>
Neahkahnie Mountain is nearby, which also has a letterbox, but be <br/>
sure to follow that box's instructions so you go to the right <br/>
trailhead.  Trailheads to Neahkahnie Mountain from within the park <br/>
will not guide you in the direction those clues lead you to.  <br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  The Cape Falcon trailhead is located in Oswald West <br/>
State Park on the Oregon Coast.  It is on Hwy 101 between Cannon <br/>
Beach and Manzanita, Oregon.  Go to the parking area for the <br/>
campground.  <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  Easy to Moderate.<br/>
<br/>
DIFFICULTY:  Moderate.  This is a four-mile round trip on a trail <br/>
with lots of ups and downs, a couple of bridges, and frequently muddy <br/>
conditions.  This is a half-day adventure once you park and hit the <br/>
trail.<br/>
<br/>
CAPE FALCON LETTERBOX: From the campground parking area, follow the <br/>
signs for Beach Access and Cape Falcon.  When you reach the beach <br/>
picnic area go toward your right where the big rules and regulations <br/>
sign is.  This is the trailhead for Cape Falcon.  Follow this trail <br/>
with the huge ancient trees, chirping of birds, and song of the surf <br/>
to keep you company along the way through this up and down hike to <br/>
paradise.  Great majestic forest and (if you're lucky enough to do <br/>
this on a clear day) views of the ocean, Smuggler's Cove, Short Sand <br/>
Beach, and Neahkahnie Mountain will forever be etched in your <br/>
memory.  There is a little side path after a small bridge, not too <br/>
far along this trail where you can see Short Sand Creek and its small <br/>
waterfall.  Keep heading forward.  It's quite a ways going uphill for <br/>
a while with a few downhills here and there.  You're coming close to <br/>
the top when the path is less in the forest and more exposed.  You'll <br/>
be up quite a ways by then.  Keep going and you'll kind of go down <br/>
again and into an area with more trees.  There will be a very <br/>
distinct fork in the trail here.  Go left and through the bushes on <br/>
up this trail up to where the trees shelter you and go all the way to <br/>
the end at the top of Cape Falcon.  There will be a metal fence post <br/>
on your left with a trail going down into the tree area.  Go all the <br/>
way down this trail until you see the twin "fallen soldiers" side by <br/>
side at an angle of 90 degrees on your left-hand side.  Now turn and <br/>
look up the way you came.  Take the small path that goes right up 8 <br/>
paces and then turn to your right.  A "soldier" similar to those <br/>
downed stands at attention to guard the Cape Falcon letterbox at its <br/>
feet.  <br/>
<br/>
While you do this hike, please give thanks to your higher power for <br/>
this wonderful landscape! Also, be grateful to Oswald West, whom this <br/>
park was named after.  He was the governor who served Oregon in the <br/>
early 1900's who made sure the Oregon Coast was designated as a State <br/>
Highway (public right of way) so that this land cannot be <br/>
privatized.  Because of Oswald West the Oregon Coast will be <br/>
protected and can be enjoyed by generations going forward.  When you <br/>
check out the forest in this park, you'll know what I mean.  You will <br/>
be among giants.<br/>
