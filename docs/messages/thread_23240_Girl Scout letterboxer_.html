                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,  I am a GS leader in Texas and my girls want to go to Build-A-<br/>
Bear with their hard-earned cookie money.  IMHO, the cookie money <br/>
does not have to be spent in an "instructional" or "deserving <br/>
manner".  My troop voted on what they wanted to do...and BAB was <br/>
what they chose.  If I had chosen, I would've picked differently, <br/>
but part of what the cookie sale is supposed to teach the girls is <br/>
goal-setting, planning, and budgeting skills.  Also, the TROOP is <br/>
supposed to decide what to do with the money, not the leaders.  So, <br/>
whatever the troop chooses to do with the money, they have learned <br/>
the skills they were supposed to learn during the cookie sale and <br/>
can use their money however THEY choose.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS  My troop also LOVES camping and we have regularly scheduled <br/>
trips twice a year.  So in their minds, the cookie money should be <br/>
used for something that they don't normally get to participate in.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Camps &amp; two Nassau County Girl Scout Camps as well as State <br/>
Parks <br/>

a <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I grew-up in an apartment in New York City and never went <br/>

&gt; &gt; untill I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was a girl scout leader.  Now my son, &amp; daughters are <br/>
campers.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; This summer we <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spent our week vacation at a camp site near Acardia Park in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maine.  Yes, we <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; did do some letterboxing too.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; These new girl scouts  are really losing out. <br/>

&gt; Hi,  I am a GS leader in Texas and my girls want to go to Build-A-<br/>
&gt; Bear with their hard-earned cookie money.  IMHO, the cookie money <br/>
&gt; does not have to be spent in an "instructional" or "deserving <br/>
&gt; manner".  My troop voted on what they wanted to do...and BAB was <br/>
&gt; what they chose.  If I had chosen, I would've picked differently, <br/>
&gt; but part of what the cookie sale is supposed to teach the girls is <br/>
&gt; goal-setting, planning, and budgeting skills.  Also, the TROOP is <br/>
&gt; supposed to decide what to do with the money, not the leaders.  <br/>
So, <br/>
&gt; whatever the troop chooses to do with the money, they have learned <br/>
&gt; the skills they were supposed to learn during the cookie sale and <br/>
&gt; can use their money however THEY choose.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS  My troop also LOVES camping and we have regularly scheduled <br/>
&gt; trips twice a year.  So in their minds, the cookie money should be <br/>
&gt; used for something that they don't normally get to participate in.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi! I am GS leader in SC, and we are using some of our cookie <br/>
&gt; money <br/>
&gt; &gt; for a weekend of camping in August and my co-leader &amp; I just <br/>
went <br/>
&gt; &gt; through outdoor cooking training and we are going to teach the <br/>
&gt; girls <br/>
&gt; &gt; to cook with different methods out doors. I can't wait! I didn't <br/>
&gt; get <br/>
&gt; &gt; to camp w GS as a girl, just lots of family camping (not <br/>
roughing <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; by any means, you don't learn too many outdoor skills in a 34' <br/>
&gt; &gt; trailer with full kitchen &amp; bathroom &amp; TV/VCR!) Anyways, I love <br/>
&gt; &gt; taking the girls outdoors and learning all kinds of new skills, <br/>
&gt; &gt; that's what I like about letterboxing (and the have 11 hidden at <br/>
&gt; our <br/>
&gt; &gt; local GS camp!!- I found 10, but they hid the last one since I <br/>
&gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; been there two weeks ago- so you know I'll be hunting!!) <br/>
&gt; &gt; just thought I'd share! <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; PS- one of our moms wants us to take them to Build A Bear- and I <br/>
&gt; &gt; can't think of a more terrible way of wasting hard earned money <br/>
&gt; (not <br/>
&gt; &gt; that I don't take my daughter there, but you are right, there <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; so <br/>
&gt; &gt; many activities the girls can be doing that can teach them <br/>
useful <br/>
&gt; &gt; skills, and self esteem and experience things they would not <br/>
&gt; &gt; otherwise experience.) How does Build A Bear foster independance <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the girls? :) <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Not all Girl Scouts miss out.  My troop camps all the time.  <br/>
We <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't live in NYC, or even close, but there are troops here <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think camping out means signing into a Holiday Inn.  And I <br/>
&gt; agree, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it's shame, they're really missing out.  Young people learn so <br/>
&gt; much <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about what they're capable of doing when they get out in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; woods.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's a fantastic self esteem building time.  That's why it's <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; important to go camping.  Not to mention how much fun it is!  <br/>
