I really appreciate everyones feedback on the letterboxes I have placed in the Mid-Atlantic Region. And I also want to thank you all for your patience. I know some of you have been stung and I sympathy goes out to you. Recently I keeping walking into Stinging Nettle. I got into it twice at Monocacy looking for the same box on two different occasions. I guess this isn't a sport for the faint of heart, only the light of heart.<br/>
<br/>
Some of you know that I was just about the only one placing boxes  in this area for some time and I had no idea what they should even look like since there were only 2 to be found at the time. So my boxes are not the best in the world and the notebooks were hand made and small. Then the Post article came out and wow! Now the boxes are getting a lot of use and the notebooks are filled up.  I have also recently moved to Harpers Ferry WV so a lot of the boxes are 2 or more hours away from me. Sooooo I am asking that those who look for twograysquirrels boxes take along a repair kit consiting of a new notebook, dry baggies and a new box to help me out and each other. Others that follow will appreciate it, I'm sure, and I will as well.<br/>
<br/>
So many of you are hiding new boxes and I am finally getting a chance to find some instead of just hiding them. So I am reluctant to go back to the old boxes when there are new ones to find. So your help in box maintence is again appreciated so the hider can be the hunter as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for playing.<br/>
May there be lots of nuts in your lives,<br/>

your post!  The Turtle and I went to your Washington Monument Box <br/>
yesterday.  The good news is the box is still their. The bad news is <br/>
the log book is soaked. Turtle said it is so sad that it almost <br/>
brings her to tears. All those lovely log-ins all smeared! You can <br/>
salvage it if you get it soon, otherwise it will start getting moldy. <br/>
We put the seperate piece of paper, that previous people had left to <br/>
stamp on, in a new baggie. <br/>
   Also keep your eye out for snakes.  We encountered one near the <br/>
box! <br/>
   Thanks for the hunt.  Karin aka psychomommy<br/>
