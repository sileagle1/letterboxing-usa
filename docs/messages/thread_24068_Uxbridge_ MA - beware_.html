Opossums are highly resistant to the rabies virus.  The chance of rabies in an opossum is EXTREMELY RARE.  It is believed that the opossum's low body temperature (94-97 F) makes it difficult for the virus to survive in an opossum's body. <br/>

  almost done with our hike when we came upon a huge raccoon (probably 20lbs)<br/>

  loping towards us. I took off up the trail and after he followed me around<br/>
  2 different bends, called 911 and ended up having local PD and Animal<br/>
  control come out.<br/>
