not flaming!  There is too much hatred of geocachers on this list.  I don't <br/>
think the occasional geocaching post is wrong, especially considering that there <br/>
are numerous boxers on the list who are ALSO geocachers.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the cheeseracing posts... I just don't get them.... I think they're <br/>
not fit for the list because that would be Off Topic (OT).  Perhaps geocaching <br/>
is also OT, but it's closer to letterboxing than cheeserasing.<br/>
<br/>
I've been out geocaching with another boxer, and we've done both hobbies <br/>
simultaneously.  Personally, I am not big on the geocaching (take one and leave <br/>
one).... now, if we could find letterboxes with GPS.....  I'd go for that!<br/>

Just my 1.5 cents....<br/>

   As for geocaching, it will always be a topic of discussion on this <br/>
board. It shows up every couple of months. Basically the same old <br/>
rehash. It's a new topic for newbies though. So, if you don't want to <br/>
read it, fast forward!<br/>

<br/>
You know, there aren't any rules prohibiting that a letterbox can't <br/>
use GPS coordinates.  Of course that means anyone without a GPS may <br/>
not be able to get it, but then I subscribe to the theory that every <br/>
letterbox has an intended audience, and it's not a big deal if <br/>
everyone can't get it.  My boxes usually require very long hikes and <br/>
I know darned well that when I hide them, very few people are going <br/>
to get out and make an effort to nab them, but that's okay, because <br/>
the boxes weren't meant for those people.  They're meant for people <br/>
that do like to go on long, strenuous hikes.  =)<br/>
