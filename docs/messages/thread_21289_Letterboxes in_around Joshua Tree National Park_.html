Hello friends!<br/>
<br/>
We're heading off for a desert camping trip to Joshua Tree National <br/>
Park in California.  I can't find any clues on the LBNA site that are <br/>
in or around the park.  The only thing I've found is a post from 2001 <br/>
to this listserv with a clue.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any info on potential letterboxing in Joshua Tree?  <br/>
Because of the lack of clues there, and since it is such a well-loved <br/>
place, we're thinking of planting our own clue on the trip.  But we'd <br/>
still love to track down other ones!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any info!<br/>
<br/>

As with all National Parks, the park service doesn't allow <br/>
letterboxing, or geocaching either, in their parks.  This has been <br/>
discussed in years past, and the park service wrote a policy paper <br/>
against it.  You will have to enjoy the park and do your <br/>
letterboxing outside the park.<br/>

This letterbox was confiscated 3 months after the clues were posted.<br/>

If you hide some boxes in or around Joshua Tree, I'd like to suggest<br/>
focusing more on the "around" than the "in".  The NPS isn't too<br/>
receptive of letterboxes and will confiscate them if they learn of it.<br/>
 So if you want your boxes to live long, healthy lives, planting them<br/>
in national parks is not a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
