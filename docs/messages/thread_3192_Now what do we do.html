<br/>
The Highlands NC clues posted on the LbNA site seem to be insufficient.  I <br/>
would like to look for that box, but it's a 3 hour drive (and no other <br/>
nearby boxes to soften the blow if I don't find it).  A friend tried it last <br/>
week, and was left standing at the indicated site with no further <br/>
instruction as to what to look for.<br/>
<br/>
I've searched the archives in hopes of finding the author of the clues; only <br/>
found my two previous requests.<br/>
<br/>
Would someone with a minute or two please look at the clues (NC, Western NC, <br/>
Macon Co.) and tell me if they agree that there is something essential <br/>
missing there?<br/>
<br/>
Or would someone who has actually found the box please tell me if those <br/>
clues indeed are sufficient?  I don't mind trying, but if it's futile, if <br/>
clues are missing from what's on the website, I don't want to waste the time <br/>
and gas.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

You can check out the original on egroups message #3018. In <br/>

Lucy, it's weird, but the last paragraph of the clue got clipped off<br/>
when we made the html page for lbna. The end should read:<br/>
