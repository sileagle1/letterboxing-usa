AQ has great search capabilities and International boxes, but<br/>

International boxes are difficult to find and searching is<br/>

Hi Silver Eagle,<br/>
We keep our clues hosted at LBNA and merely set up the link to them at <br/>
AQ. That way when a clue needs massaging we go to LBNA to do the <br/>
editing. This is pretty easy to set up. You do need to type in the <br/>
name of the letterbox and the URL, but after you do a few the URL to <br/>
the boxes previously entered pops up and you can delete the last part <br/>
of the URL containing number and name and then type in the newest <br/>
number and name. I was able to complete all of ours in just two <br/>
days.There really aren't two sets of clues they way we have ours, and <br/>
the LBNA site remains the depository for the bulk of the clues.<br/>
<br/>

I thought you kept all your clues on Geocities? *raised eyebrows* =)<br/>
<br/>
In any case, both LbNA and AQ allow you to host the clue on that<br/>
server or link to a clue on another website, so the actual clue only<br/>
needs to be listed in a single location (LbNA, AQ, or your own site)<br/>
in any case. Updating the status of a missing box and such details<br/>
still requires logging into each site and changing it, but the clue<br/>
itself shouldn't be location in more than one location.<br/>

You can check a box at Atlas Quest to add them to LBNA.  Sounds <br/>
pretty simple to me.  I have boxes at both sites.  Atlas Quest with <br/>
the clue posted at LBNA.  When I retire a box, I just remove the <br/>
link to the clues, and keep it listed at AQ, for finders who want a <br/>
more complete personal logbook.  Then I will remove the clues from <br/>
LBNA so I don't have inactive boxes listed.  It's my way of not <br/>
cluttering up LBNA.  Granted, my system was started before the <br/>
webmasters started adding more friendly features to LBNA.  But my <br/>
system works for me.<br/>
<br/>
With the wonderful volunteer spirit we have at both sites, I would <br/>
not want to create an undo burden for them.  What happens when there <br/>
is a minor or major computer glitch and we cannot access clues from <br/>
either site?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; In my opinion, the answer would be to let LBNA remain the<br/>
&gt; main database repository for all clues, but let AQ access<br/>
&gt; that database to perform its searches and other neat functions.<br/>
&gt; If this is not possible, the next best thing would be for<br/>
&gt; LBNA to download all its clues weekly to AQ so it would have<br/>
&gt; all the clues to work with.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan has done us a great service at Atlas Quest.  If we listed only <br/>
the home page for LBNA as the link to get the clues, he found the <br/>
errors and corrected them to point directly to the clue page.  <br/>
Outstanding.  I am careful to paste the page link now.  I would love <br/>
to see all my finds at AQ, but that will take the willingness of <br/>
veterans with many plants to take some time and add them.  Not <br/>
everyone wants their boxes listed everywhere.  I wouldn't want to <br/>
legislate how and where we find clues.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Neither of these options may be possible, but just thought<br/>
&gt; I would throw it out there for the webmasters of both sites<br/>
&gt; to think about.<br/>
&gt; Keep up the good work!<br/>
<br/>
Volunteers, gotta love 'm!<br/>

I won't duplicate the description about using links, but I <br/>
did want to mention that I've made a couple recent tweaks <br/>
to LbNA's Search Letterbox page. I hope to someday add an <br/>
option to search for boxes near a city; that's one of my <br/>
favorite features on AQ.<br/>

AQ will never be completely effective if it does not<br/>
have all the clues to work with.  That is what I want,<br/>
and expecting everyone to enter their clues (or links<br/>
to clues) is unrealistic.  If you are able to automatically<br/>
populate LBNA with new AQ clues, I was hoping the opposite<br/>
could be done with existing clues in LBNA.  <br/>
Bottom line:  I would like to have all the features of <br/>
AQ to use on all the clues in LBNA, either by populating<br/>
AQ with LBNA clues, or adding and fixing features in LBNA.<br/>
Maybe this is too much to hope for, but it doesn't hurt to ask!<br/>
