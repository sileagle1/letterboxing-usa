&gt; &gt; Im just curious as to what everyone puts in thier logbooks <br/>
besides the<br/>
&gt; stamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; and date.  I've just recently started and put the name of the box,<br/>
&gt; location,<br/>

located.  Is<br/>
&gt; &gt; there anything else others add?  Just curious.<br/>

&gt; What is the average size of a logbook inside a letterbox? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't managed to replicate a single logbook that i've made <br/>
now that I handcraft them. Each logbook is made well after the <br/>
original inspiration for the box/stamp has passed. The log is <br/>
made purely out of functionality and usually reflects the theme of <br/>
the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
My Sea Stamps boxes have a 1 inch by 1.5 inch sized logbook - <br/>
or something equally small. Microboxes (usually in film canisters <br/>
or sometimes in centrifuge tubes) have archival ph neutral paper  <br/>
in long strips carefully wrapped around the stamp to fit nicely in <br/>
the box.<br/>
<br/>
I say don't make your stamp based on the logbook size, make <br/>
your stamp based purely on inspiration. A word of caution <br/>
however (from experience) if you don't scout out your location <br/>
first, then you won't have an idea of the box size that it can <br/>
sustain. <br/>
<br/>
It is all integrally linked - the location, the inspiration for the <br/>
stamp, the box, the clue and the size is all taken into <br/>
consideration in the placement. Best of luck - another way to get <br/>
an idea on logbook making is just to visit a lot of boxes and see <br/>
what other people do...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of the "regular" size boxes I have found, most of the log books <br/>
range between 2x3 and 3x5 -- a few larger, a few smaller.  As was <br/>
previously mentioned, microboxes are different.  I have seen these <br/>
with the long strips of paper rolled up, and also a single large <br/>
sheet of paper, folded and rolled to fit the container.<br/>
<br/>
When planning your signature stamp, you should be safe at most boxes <br/>
if you try to keep it on the smaller side of the "average" size <br/>
books mentioned above.  A couple of ideas to handle the smaller <br/>
books and microboxes:<br/>
<br/>
-  Some people carry a smaller stamp that they use just for the <br/>
small books<br/>
-  You could also stamp just a portion or a corner of your stamp <br/>
when you encounter the smaller books -- can be kind of an <br/>
interesting design in itself<br/>
