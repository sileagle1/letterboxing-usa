is a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
Although not widely publicised, because to do so would cause huge potential<br/>
problems, there is also a large well organised letterboxing<br/>
organisation/community in an area close to where I live. [I appreciate that<br/>
this is fairly cryptic and this is deliberate, if anyone wants to know more<br/>
then by all means e-mail me direct - charles@bcasol.co.uk]<br/>
<br/>
I have been meaning to put out a stamp up here for some time and just<br/>
haven't gotten around to doing it. Basic laziness I guess. My<br/>
brother-in-laws family put out a box for me on Dartmoor as my 40th birthday<br/>
present and I have been meaning to put out a box that links to it up here,<br/>
but as I say haven't done so yet.<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to volunteer to put out either a copy of say the No1 stamp<br/>
or if you prefer a separate/new stamp altogether and likewise provide the<br/>
container and the book and look after it. Perhaps this will spur me on!<br/>
<br/>
That's gone and done it !<br/>

Subject: [L-USA] L-USA Boxes on Dartmoor in 20 minutes !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;From Graham Howard<br/>
&gt;aka The Moorland Wizard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dear All<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It's a great Idea about a tribute box to the Letterboxers of America...I<br/>
&gt;support that wholeheartedly !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also vote for Adrian to put out and maintain it....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;( I love the idea of voting for someone else [in absentia] to do the work<br/>
&gt;! <g>)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But..er surely... as it takes only 20 minutes to carve a stamp  !!!!<br/>
&gt;<tongue cheek="" firmly="" in="" very=""><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am amazed that only one will suffice !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sincerely though I do think a small tribute "walk" would be a good<br/>
&gt;idea..(seem to have heard the idea afore) ..and certainly Susan would be a<br/>
&gt;great choice for the meister carver...but surely from all across L-USA<br/>
&gt;land  there are some others who might volunteer a stamp ... (hi to Susan<br/>
&gt;btw haven't heard from thee in a long time)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am really proposing a 'L-USA walk'.. of say 6 - 10 boxes...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What should appear there ?....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;well<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do think that perhaps the Prayer Rock stamp should be remembered as US<br/>
&gt;No 1<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;...maybe even The Smithsonian (?)..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now here's a good topic to vote on !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Choose the stamps for the Dartmoor Tribute Walk..(Tribute to Letterboxers<br/>
&gt;of America that is !)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will volunteer to supply the boxes (tupperware type or large tubes<br/>
&gt;.[.pill pots we use here.]  your choice)<br/>
&gt;and I will be pleased to prepare and supply the log books......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'll even join Adrian on the setting out and make a photo record of the<br/>
&gt;exciting outing..even video if you wish ....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dangerous Idea Number 2:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Shouldn't this internet society agree to set out a short walk..er every<br/>
&gt;year !....or is it all too soon ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is that 51 by Y2K ?<br/>

&gt; I am really proposing a 'L-USA walk'.. of say 6 - 10 boxes...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think Graham might be on to something... perhaps we should<br/>
consider placing a SERIES of stamps on Dartmoor, rather than<br/>
one single letterbox... Avoids the dangers of placing all our<br/>
eggs in a single box... er, basket, that is.  Then, God forbid,<br/>
if something dreadful should happen to one letterbox, we would<br/>
still be represented on the moors.<br/>
<br/>
I, for one, would be delighted to provide a stamp for such a<br/>
project.  And, although I must confess to being a member of<br/>
Marty's controversial 20-minute Stamp Carver's club, I promise<br/>
I would take the time to make this one a MADsterpiece!! <br/>
...and in red rubber, no less.<br/>
<br/>
As for publicity, I would like to see the project documented<br/>
on the website, complete with stamp images and Graham's photos.<br/>
I'm not sure if we should publish the clues, however.  If we<br/>
place boxes on Dartmoor, we should let our Dartmoorian friends<br/>
assign Darmoorian-style clues to them and distribute those<br/>
clues via word-of-mouth and/or the official Catalogue of Dartmoor<br/>
Letterboxes.  "When in Darmoor, do as the Dartmoorians do,"<br/>
as the old saying goes. (or if the saying doesn't go like that,<br/>
it should!)<br/>
<br/>
If everyone likes this idea, we should do as Graham suggests<br/>
and begin collecting ideas for several stamps, instead of just<br/>
one.  I like Linda's suggestion of a map of the USA with our<br/>
founding year inside.  Also, a tribute to Prayer Rock, our first<br/>
American letterbox.  Dan presented a list of other "firsts"<br/>
recently that could be reviewed for ideas.  Graham mentions<br/>
honoring The Smithsonian with a stamp (this might be a ready-made<br/>
follow-up story... perhaps we should tell them we'll do this if<br/>
they supply reprints of the article for us to distribute!)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we could pay tribute to the various regions of the<br/>
country, such as the Pacific NW, New England, Great Lakes,<br/>
Midwest, etc.  Another stamp might honor our group's innovative<br/>
use of the Internet to organize hobbyists from around the<br/>
country into a unified virtual community.  I would sort of like<br/>
to see a "thank you" stamp for our friends in the UK who have<br/>
participated in this group and offered all their creative ideas<br/>
and priceless insight regarding the Dartmoor culture.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly... Yes, Graham, our goal is now "All 50 + 1 by Y2K!!"<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, Der Mad Stamper<br/>

<br/>
I think we should also consider including a <br/>
humorous stamp:<br/>
<br/>
Something that plays on the idea that we're<br/>
party-crashers or foreign invaders (We may<br/>
not really be perceived as such, but I'd feel a bit<br/>
like I was). I don't know how most Dartmoor <br/>
locals feel about having yank boxes sprinkled <br/>
throughout the landscape -I'm hoping they're all<br/>
as warm and welcoming as those amongst us- <br/>
but if there's even a tiny bit of animosity, <br/>
humor may help to cut that a bit. Whatcha <br/>
think? You think my paranoia is showing? ;D<br/>
<br/>
I also second the Smithsonian stamp and the<br/>
Prayer Rock stamp!<br/>
<br/>
On that note, are there any Dartmoor boxes<br/>
planted over here yet?<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I'm getting pretty good with this stamp<br/>
carving stuff! I volunteer to do a stamp if<br/>
needed.<br/>

My general opinion is that stamps should remain secret, both in<br/>
what we place for this project, and for the "source" stamps<br/>
from the first 10 or 13 states (meaning if the stamps in the<br/>
first states are secret, how could we use them?)  Am I weird<br/>
or alone in feeling this way?  To me, secret stamps add cachet<br/>
and mystique (it's not an anti-social tendency :-))<br/>
<br/>
In any case, as all the stamps I have personally seen in the<br/>
field in the USA are tied to their location, it may seem a bit<br/>
weird to use location-specific stamps for this project, (so I prefer<br/>
the previous ideas to this one) but don't let my opinions get in <br/>
the way :-)<br/>

I tend to agree with Tom &amp; Randy. I think unique stamps specific to our mission is more appropriate. <br/>

I don't think that's weird.  It may seem weird because you have been<br/>
the only person (may be one or two others) stressing this position for<br/>
many months.  But it is being played out and is quite common.  You<br/>
will notice that none of the boxes in Alaska, Minnesota, Tennessee,<br/>
Texas, or Missouri have stamp images and only some of the boxes in <br/>
Pennsylvania, Maryland and Massachusetts have stamp images.  I think<br/>
the majority do, but quite a few do not.  So it seems to me that we<br/>
can represent it both ways.  Some can be sectret and some can be<br/>
published.<br/>
<br/>
I'm having a hard time recollecting what were the first ten letterboxes<br/>
though.  I did not keep records because I didn't think it was important.<br/>
So we'll have to figure that one out (hopefully peacefully).  I know<br/>
Prayer Rock was first and I think Bob Summers was next to the punch with<br/>
a whole bunch of them in Alaska (some carved with the kids help).  My<br/>
first letterbox (Split Rock Lighthouse) was about number 25. <br/>
Other than that I don't remember much.<br/>

NOT OVER HERE. Put out as a walk/series they will get snapped up. I have<br/>
already sent copies to our letterboxing club over here of stamp copies off<br/>
of web pages and they are quite impressed.<br/>
It has a dartmoor theme because dartmoor started it.<br/>

There is a feature on egroups that I haven't experimented with, yet, and I<br/>
thought this might be a good opportunity to try it out...<br/>
<br/>
Any registered member of the group can poll the rest of the group on any<br/>
topic.<br/>
<br/>
So, I'm going to give this a try and see how well it goes over.  If a majority<br/>
of people are willing to respond to it, we may be able to use this tool to<br/>
help make other decisions about the group and the website.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you are interested, I will soon be generating a poll of the group to<br/>
help us decide what sort of stamps we should send over to Dartmoor.  You<br/>
should receive a message that links you to a website where you can vote for<br/>
each of the choices that you like.  You will be able to monitor the results of<br/>
the poll from our archive page.  If and when a majority of people have<br/>
responded to the poll, I will have the results sent out to the group.<br/>
<br/>
Here goes nothing...<br/>
