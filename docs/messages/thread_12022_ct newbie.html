                    <div class="plaintext-content">I started geocaching last March and since then have discovered letterboxing.  <br/>
Have been enjoying letterboxing lately but only recently put together an <br/>
official stamp book minus my first couple stamps which I haphazardly stamped <br/>
on the clue pages I took along.  Trying to get back to them to put them <br/>
officially into my letterboxing notebook.<br/>
One of my first letterboxes was St Veronica.  I went back today to restamp <br/>
but I couldn't find it. <br/>
Today I also did Purple Cows but couldn't find the first stamp "Dance like <br/>
Nobody's Around".  <br/>
Realized today that I could log my discoveries here.  Looking forward to <br/>
meeting others along the way and learning more!<br/>
