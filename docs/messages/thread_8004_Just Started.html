<p>hi there... yes! there are other college aged people! i am 20, will be graduating from college in the spring, and have become addicted to letterboxing over the past two years. truthfully, only my closest friends know about this addiction. most of them wouldn't have the patience or appreciation for nature to deal with it. my mother was the one who introduced my two sisters (ages 23 and 25) to letterboxing, and we love it! we're very fortunate to live just a stone's throw away from mansfield, ct, where there are MANY MANY boxes! good luck hunting and happy trails!</p>
<p>small bear :)<br/><br/><br/>Love always, </p>
