If you have your clues in a database already, I'd be happy to integrate them<br/>
databas-ically (?!) so you don't have to type them in.<br/>

Contact me off-list for details.<br/>

Any are valid.<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to figure the best way to get state and county data.  I was<br/>
going to head to census.gov and look for a list there, but I hadn't yet.<br/>
Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Mystery boxes: Good point. I have support for mystery boxes on my list, but<br/>
haven't implemented yet.<br/>
<br/>
Status:  I have been playing around with the user configuration stuff.  Is<br/>
there anything else that you can think of that would be cool if you could<br/>
configure it?  Show status info was the only one I had.  Actually, there's<br/>
no way to update the verified date yet, so I might not show it right yet.<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
If I can ask, what's your real name?  And do you actually hang glide?<br/>

I'd like to contact you off-list, and I can probably guess your e-mail<br/>
address, but it'd be easier if you had it on your web page ! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here's a little feedback based on some things I thought about while building<br/>
my version of the database:<br/>
<br/>
1) You'll probably want to be able to search by state, and by state and<br/>
county.  That means you'll need a database of county names so that there is<br/>
input consistency.  When we make contact I can ship you that database.<br/>
<br/>
2) You'll probably want a State named "Mystery" and a county within each<br/>
state named "Mystery" for the, guess what, mystery boxes!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
3) You might want to make the viewing of the status info a user-selectable<br/>
option.  Some people don't want to know the status of a box.<br/>
<br/>
Hope these are helpful suggestions.  Again, nice job on the page!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

Well, I've had a couple of comments that people may not want to see the <br/>
date that a box was last visited.  Personally, if I were to see that a <br/>
box hadn't been verified in a year or so, I'd probably email the owner<br/>
to see if they knew it still existed.  That way, I don't tear up a bunch<br/>
of ground looking for something that doesn't exist.<br/>
<br/>
If you have input on what you think, I'd like to hear it.<br/>
<br/>

Just curious (and it's early in the morning, so perhaps this would be <br/>
more obvious in daylight)...  why would somebody not want to know the <br/>
status of a box?<br/>
