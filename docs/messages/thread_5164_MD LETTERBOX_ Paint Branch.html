(Montgomery County). It is a nice walk to the box and there is one <br/>
stream crossing.  You can probably hop the stones though. Enjoy!  If <br/>
you have any questions, feel free to E-mail me.<br/>

<br/>
Box Name:  Paint Branch <br/>
<br/>
Planted:  April 27, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Location:  Good Hope section of the Paint Branch<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Location:<br/>
<br/>
The start location of this box is Charles R. Drew Elementary School <br/>
in Silver Spring, MD (Montgomery County).  Charles Drew Elementary is <br/>
in a neighborhood off Good Hope Road.  Please note that access to <br/>
this site is limited to weekends or during the summer months when <br/>
school is not in session.  Park in the Main Parking Lot and walk <br/>
across the Athletic field to the woods.  On the far right corner of <br/>
the athletic field, next to the backstop,  is an entrance to the park <br/>
trails.  That is where your journey begins.  This particular area is <br/>
of special interest because the headwaters of Paint Branch holds the <br/>
only stock of self-sustaining Brown Trout in the immediate Washington <br/>
DC Metropolitan Area.  Tread lightly and pick up trash if you see it. <br/>
There is one small stream crossing!!!<br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
<br/>
Down this path, until you see the sky.<br/>
Find the car and pass it by,<br/>
Continue on past two metal disks,<br/>
A few more cars, touch by death's kiss.<br/>
Across the stream, take a right..<br/>
Find the bug and stop on site.  <br/>
Thirteen Paces and stop in view of me,<br/>
Way to your left, I'm hiding at the base of that large rotting tree.<br/>
