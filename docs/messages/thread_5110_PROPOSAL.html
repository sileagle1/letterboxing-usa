Dear Sir,<br/>
<br/>
BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$ 14.3 M (FOURTEEN MILLION,THREE <br/>
HUNDRED THOUSAND USD.).  <br/>
First, I must solicit your trust and strictest confidence in this transaction; this is by nature of <br/>
the top-secret information I am about to divulge to you. You were introduced to us by a <br/>
mutual acquaintance from the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce, Foreign Trade Division, who <br/>
does not know of the nature of what I am about to introduce to you. He only knows that I <br/>
have some funds to invest abroad, hence he recommended you.<br/>
<br/>
I am the Director of Engineering &amp; Project of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation <br/>
(N.N.P.C) in Lagos, Nigeria. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of <br/>
US$14,300,000.00 into your private company account for mutual benefits. This money <br/>
came about as a result of a contract for the supply of two thousand, three hundred and <br/>
sixty-seven computer unit, installation and the Y2K compliance turn-around maintenance <br/>
executed on behalf of my Ministry (N.N.P.C), in the year 1999. This contract was officially <br/>
assigned to be awarded and executed by two foreign contractors at the tune of <br/>
US$105,500,000.00, but in the course of my negotiation, I bargained with only one foreign <br/>
contractor, a Bulgarian firm which now executed the contract at the cost <br/>
ofUS$91.2000.000.00.  Thus leaving the remaining US$14.3M floating in the escrow <br/>
account of the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N) to the benefits of we the three members of <br/>
the contract award panel unknown to the contractor and any other person in my Ministry.  <br/>
This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is <br/>
presently securing his payment from my Ministry.<br/>
<br/>
It is however to this effect that I seek your maximum assistance and approval to present <br/>
your company name alongside with the Bulgarian contractor as the second foreign <br/>
contractor to enable me transfer the difference (US$14.3M) into your account for further <br/>
investment depending on your advice.<br/>
<br/>
On actualization of the transaction, the funds will be shared thus:<br/>
1.      30% of the money go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds.<br/>
2.      10% for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that may be incurred in <br/>
the course of the transaction for insurance phone bills, documentation etc.<br/>
3.         60% to we three members of the Contract Award Panel.<br/>
<br/>
 All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth actualization of the <br/>
transaction within fourteen working days of commencement after receipt of the following <br/>
information by fax: Your companys Name. Address. Phone/Fax number and activities. Also, <br/>
if we opt for electronic transfer only other than payment by solar bank draft or cash call <br/>
programme, then your bank account particulars.<br/>
<br/>
The above information will enable me make the application and lodge claims to the <br/>
concerned Ministries in favour of your company or name and it is pertinent to state here that <br/>
this deal is entirely based on trust and the fear of God.<br/>
<br/>
 If you are able to handle, feel free to reach me by fax on: 234-1-7596254. Also furnish me <br/>
with your own phone and fax numbers, as I will be sending you immediately I receive your <br/>
positive response some classified documents.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in anticipation for your positive response.<br/>
<br/>
Yours faithfully.<br/>
