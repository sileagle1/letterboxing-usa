  eadd       etre        fsenr        pworekodce        liatr <br/>

<br/>
  Start at the tree with _____ (insert answer to #5) blazes on it. <br/>
  Take _____ (insert answer to #1 and remove the middle # keeping only the first and last #. So if the answer was 123 insert 13) paces to a stump. <br/>
  Take a reading of _____* (insert answer to #6 adding 5 to the answer) and go to a stump with an odd tree to it's right.<br/>
  Take a reading of ____* (insert only the last two #s of #7) and take 10 paces to a sort of square flat rock. <br/>
  Take a reading of 90* and take _____ (insert only the last two #s to #2 and add 3) paces to a leaning rock. <br/>
  Take a reading of 140* to a pile of rocks near a fallen tree. <br/>

answer to trivia question #8 wasn't used.  I actually just got back <br/>
from getting all four of the series - pretty cool!  Nice stamps!  <br/>
Watch out for the spider webs though, they're EVERYWHERE!!<br/>
