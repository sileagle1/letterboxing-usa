We had fun finding this letterbox on our way to the<br/>
airport.  What a great stamp!  I tried sending this to your email <br/>
address, but it was returned as fail mai.  See the note below on the <br/>
directions.  Thanks again.<br/>
<br/>
One thing you might <br/>
want to change in your clues is that when you exit I65<br/>
you should head west rather than east.  We were<br/>
heading east initially and then realized we had passed<br/>
the great landmarks when we were coming from the other<br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
We were glad to find at least one box while there and<br/>
managed to plant 2.  We ran out of time, but I did<br/>
carve some more stamps for the area.  I hope to be<br/>
back in a couple of months to look for some more. <br/>
Thanks again for hiding some for us.  =-)  <br/>
