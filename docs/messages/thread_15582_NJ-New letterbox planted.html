<br/>
If you know the Pine Barrens then you will know the pilot of peace and<br/>
where his mission came to an end.  Take the road that bears his name<br/>
past his monument to where the black top ends and the dirt road begins.  <br/>
<br/>
Take the dirt road before the old railroad tracks at a bearing of 240<br/>
degrees.  Watch out for the sugar sand.  A 4x4 will be needed here if<br/>
you wish to drive back or you may park on the side of the road and<br/>
walk.  WATCH for rattlesnakes, as they are pretty prevalent in the<br/>
area.  For the walking portion of this hunt in the warmer months, you<br/>
will need bug repellant .  Watch out for the ticks and chiggers.  <br/>
<br/>
Continue on the dirt road and stay to the outside of the big puddles<br/>
when crossing them.   This is a single car road, but not a 1-way road.<br/>
 Follow dirt road approximately 0.6 miles from the entrance of the<br/>
road.  Along the road you will pass 2 dirt trails on your right.  <br/>
After the second dirt trail at approximately 0.6 miles you will see a<br/>
place to park on your right.  You will see small hatchet marks (tsk<br/>
tsk) on the tree that will be on your left when you pull in to park.  <br/>
<br/>
Head from where your parked across the dirt road you drove in on and<br/>
head due south down the hill to the railroad tracks and cross over the<br/>
tracks.  Follow the trail along side the tracks west 40 paces.  Look<br/>
for where the rails are joined together.  Underneath you will find<br/>
what you came for.  You will see various scattered old railroad ties<br/>
in the vicinity.  <br/>
<br/>
Head back east 40 paces and up the hill north to your car.  Back up<br/>
and drive out the road you came in on.  Thank you for stamping in.  <br/>
<br/>
Always proceed at your discretion.  The owner of this letterbox<br/>
assumes no responsibility for your actions or any occurrence to you or<br/>
your company on this hunt.  Please remember you are in a state forest.<br/>
 Remember pack in pack out your trash and only you can prevent forest<br/>
fires.  Treat this forest as if it were your home.  Tread lightly.  <br/>
