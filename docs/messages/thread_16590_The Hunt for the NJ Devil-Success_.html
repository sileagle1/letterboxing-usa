<br/>
I wanted to be the first to publicly thank<br/>
letterboxingbee for putting together the NJ gathering today. We had a<br/>
great time and can't wait to head back to Jersey for more boxes. We<br/>
got 6 event only boxes, found a HH, got I forget how many other event<br/>
boxes, and a ton of exchanges. I think all together we got 29 new<br/>
stamps (although I only got 27 in my book since I somehow managed to<br/>
miss getting DnA's stamps.) **smacks self in head**<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxingbee did a great job organizing everything (and everyone)<br/>
and planting the event only boxes. She should be very proud of<br/>
herself. I know I am. :)<br/>
<br/>
If we're still here next year, we hope to do it all again!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
NeverEnuff and Team PresSinOn<br/>
