Hi   For the patches  mail your order to Town Hall Embroidery, their address <br/>
is on the logo patch order form.  Normally someone would be collecting the <br/>
orders and making one big bulk order but an order was just made by Town Hall <br/>
and they set aside extra.<br/>
 If they don't have enough to fill your order, it may be a while since Town <br/>
Hall has to have a minimum of 50 to make the patche orders. <br/>

<br/>
Go to that part of the LBNA main site and read all<br/>
about the patches and decals available.<br/>
<br/>
You do NOT need to have a certain number of finds to<br/>
be able to purchase the LBNA Logo patches at $2.15<br/>
each.  I believe Mohmers has stated if you wish to<br/>
purchase these patches simply print out the order form<br/>
found on the website above and send it to Town Hall<br/>
Embroidery (address on the form)--including one<br/>
first-class stamp for every 2 patches,plus a large<br/>
self-addressed stamped envelope-- and when they<br/>
recieve enough orders (I believe 50 is the magic<br/>
number) they will make them up and send them to you.<br/>
<br/>
Town Hall Embroidery also does the window decals<br/>
($4.29 each with a minimum of 25 orders).<br/>
<br/>
I haven't ordered the merit badges or White decals so<br/>
I'll leave that process to Mohmers or someone who has<br/>
to explain.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, let me add my 2 cents here:<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to order this way, make sure that you are willing to wait up<br/>
to several months for your check to clear, or use a money order.<br/>
<br/>
I had closed my account in July after a long time of no activity and before<br/>
Town Hall sent the patches or cashed the check. And although the closed<br/>
account should have just bounced the check back to Town Hall, and I could<br/>
have sent them a replacement check, the check forced my count to reopen and<br/>
overdraw (because the bank hadn't teller hadn't properly closed the account,<br/>
I was told the first time).  The check was for $10.75 and was written in<br/>
April.<br/>
<br/>
More interessting than that was I had tried to call Town Hall Embroidery and<br/>
the local operator said there was no such listing. However, they are<br/>
apparently listed as Town Hall Archery, and answer the phone as Town Hall<br/>
Sports.  I had left a detailed message on their answering machine about the<br/>
check the very day I had found out what had happened. No one bothered to<br/>
call me back.  I thought I must have had the wrong number, but I emailed<br/>
mohmers and I had been right, so I called again.<br/>
<br/>
This is where it starts to get interesting. I called back during business<br/>
hours and was put through to a woman who was very rude, terse, and<br/>
uncooperative, who claimed that they don't do patches for people, that she<br/>
had already complained and asked that her company name "be taken off that<br/>
internet thing" *last year* and still people are sending checks. And she<br/>
said that she wasn't even sure who it was in her company that was telling<br/>
people to order this way, but she was pretty sure it was a friend of one of<br/>
the workers there, but someone outside the company, still having people<br/>
order this way. She railed on about how she nor anyone else there has the<br/>
time to deal with this, that they only do large wholesale bulk patches.<br/>
Furthermore, she said she didn't want checks from anyone coming there unless<br/>
it was one check for the whole order.  She also claimed that she ended up<br/>
paying postage on these small orders because people don't send the right<br/>
amount, but I told her that I had put much more postage on the return<br/>
envelope than was required. She said she would not send back the check for a<br/>
replacement, and when I asked if I could just speak to whoever sends their<br/>
checks to the bank, she refused, again saying that she had no time for any<br/>
of this and wasn't about to walk down to another part of the building<br/>
because she had work to do.  Well, you can imagine my frustration. I was as<br/>
nice as I could be and pointed out that resending the check might reopen the<br/>
account and bounce again, causing me more problems, and her company would<br/>
still not get paid.  I wanted to send a replacement check from my new bank<br/>
but I needed the old check.  In the end, she agreed to take down my name and<br/>
phone number and put it on the desk of "the girl I think whose friend it is<br/>
that has people ordering these." Naturally, I never heard a word. What they<br/>
did was resubmit the check. And although my bank had assured me that one<br/>
check would not, could not, reopen the account, it did.  I just got another<br/>
month's statement with the overdraft and associated fees.  And no one at my<br/>
old bank has been able to tell me how this is happening (through the magic<br/>
of computers and their automated system, they think).<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that the woman I spoke to, who would not tell me her name,<br/>
was completely in a headspin over the patch orders or because someone hadn't<br/>
gotten permission to take the orders this way and was taking it out on me.<br/>
So, just be aware that whoever it is at Town Hall who supposedly does this<br/>
has created some rift within her company, and they *don't* return calls, at<br/>
least long distance ones.  Unless Mohmers is going to see through the patch<br/>
ordering, I'd be very leery of doing business with that place.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Go to that part of the LBNA main site and read all<br/>
&gt; about the patches and decals available.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You do NOT need to have a certain number of finds to<br/>
&gt; be able to purchase the LBNA Logo patches at $2.15<br/>
&gt; each.  I believe Mohmers has stated if you wish to<br/>
&gt; purchase these patches simply print out the order form<br/>
&gt; found on the website above and send it to Town Hall<br/>
&gt; Embroidery (address on the form)--including one<br/>
&gt; first-class stamp for every 2 patches,plus a large<br/>
&gt; self-addressed stamped envelope-- and when they<br/>
&gt; recieve enough orders (I believe 50 is the magic<br/>
&gt; number) they will make them up and send them to you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Town Hall Embroidery also does the window decals<br/>
&gt; ($4.29 each with a minimum of 25 orders).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven't ordered the merit badges or White decals so<br/>
&gt; I'll leave that process to Mohmers or someone who has<br/>
&gt; to explain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope that helps<br/>
