03 by Salamander. Difficulty: Easy.  This letterbox is locvated very <br/>
near the Chillicothe campus of Ohio University. CLUES:  Go to the <br/>
library at the OU-C campus. There  is a large patio at the rear of <br/>
the building.A wall surrounds this patio. Stand at the northwest <br/>
corner of this wall and take a reading of 280 degrees. Head in that <br/>
direction until you come to a wooden utility pole topped by a <br/>
streetlamp. At this point,take a reading of 330 degrees. 15 paces at <br/>
this heading will take you to a many-trunked tree within a wooded <br/>
area. The box is hidden in the base of the tree between the trunks, <br/>
under some leaves and a rock.<br/>

Difficulty: Easy.Location: Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio. Polly <br/>
wants a letterbox, so a letterbox Polly shall have. Polly would <br/>
probably enjoy seeing some visitors, too! This box is located just <br/>
off the Chillicothe Bikeway/Pedestrian Corridor.  CLUES: Go to the <br/>
new portion of the bikeway/pedestrian corridor.This recently opened <br/>
stretch of the walkway goes under the also new Bridge Street Bridge. <br/>
There is a black ornamental fence (Looks like wrought-iron) <br/>
bordering this part of the walkway.Go to the westernmost end of the <br/>
fence and stop. Then head west for 12 paces. Stop. To your right, <br/>
there is a fairly large rock which is closer to the path than the <br/>
other rocks are. Polly is hiding under a nest of smaller rocks <br/>
directly beside this large one.<br/>

Chillicothe, Ohio. (Ross Co.). Difficulty: Easy. CLUES:This <br/>
letterbox is located near the Bikeway/Pedestrian Corridor in <br/>
Chillicothe. At one of the corridor's  parking areas, there is <br/>
an "Ohio Historical Marker" about Camp Bull, a stockade built to <br/>
confine British prisoners during the War of 1812. You must find this <br/>
marker. Due north of this marker, and at 24 paces, there is a <br/>
smallish shrub, one of several used in the landscaping. The box is <br/>
hidden in the mulch at the base of the shrub.<br/>

Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio. Difficulty: Easy.  CLUES: Go to the <br/>
Ross County Service Center (old Harts Building)on Western Avenue <br/>
(U.S. Rt. 50) in Chillicothe. Locate an American flag. Standing <br/>
between the flagpole and the white cylindrical object in front of <br/>
it, take a compass reading of 105 degrees. Some distance across the <br/>
parking lot at that heading is a Spruce tree. You must go to that <br/>
tree. Once there, note how the roadway and curbs are constructed <br/>
near the tree--do you see a place where a white concrete curb and a <br/>
black asphalt-type curb meet to form a 90 degree angle? Bisect the <br/>
angle with an imaginary line to form two 45 degree angles. The box <br/>
is hidden under the tree at the "end" of the imaginary line.  NOTE: <br/>
The parking lot is not extremely busy during non-business hours; <br/>
however, you will be near a shopping center access road which gets a <br/>
fair amount of use-- so of course, please use appropriate caution <br/>
and watch for traffic.<br/>
