&gt; For the record, I did notify them promptly and directly.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, the offensive content was deleted 7 hours <br/>
and 9 minutes after this notification, which was sent _after_<br/>
the accusations on the public list.  Pretty efficient, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, this has been a pretty upsetting experience for <br/>
me and my family, and we APPRECIATE all the support.  It has also <br/>
been very upsetting to another moderator, and I'm sure they will, <br/>
and should, take all the support directed at me personally as well.<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks from the moderators, and sorry for another post in <br/>
this nasty and unfortunate thread, but hopefully this brings it to <br/>
full closure.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, moderators will continue to address spam and other offensive <br/>
content as soon as they are (preferably politely) notified of it; we <br/>
don't condone any of it.  We don't guarantee 7 hour response time, but<br/>
will do the best we can, and appreciate your understanding and patience.<br/>

we visited your box last spring and it did  have a couple inches of water in<br/>
it, which we emptied. however we were pretty perplexed as to why it would<br/>
have so much water since it wasn't really in a flood area, nor was it out in<br/>
the open. what we figured was that the water is leaking into the box from<br/>
where the handle on the lid is!  i  have a similar box and tested it at home<br/>
and sure enough, water leaks through the  handle. you might take that under<br/>
consideration.<br/>
