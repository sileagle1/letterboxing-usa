time between games to head back to Fort Belvoir to hunt the 3rd box <br/>
hidden in Accotink Wildlife Refuge.  The turtles were loving the <br/>
change in weather as there were scores of them out sunning themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The Mad Piper's Virginia Rail letterbox was found tucked safely in <br/>
it's spot.  Had to be real careful to follow The Piper's precise <br/>
compass instructions, as there are many 4-in-1's, 3-in-1's, and 2-in-<br/>
1's that can mislead you.  This was another fun hunt!<br/>
