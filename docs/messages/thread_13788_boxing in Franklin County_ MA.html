<br/>
Binx and I went for a rainy camping weekend in Franklin County and <br/>
picked up the following boxes:<br/>
<br/>
-Captain Tupperware<br/>
-Poet's Seat Tower #1 and #2 (alas, #3 is missing! We were <br/>
disappointed especially since the three stamps are supposed to form a <br/>
complete image.)<br/>
-High Ledges<br/>
-Dragonfly (replaced a leaky ziploc that the stamp was in and wrapped <br/>
the stamp in a paper towel. The log was dry.)<br/>
-Acrophobia<br/>
-North Mount Sugarloaf<br/>
-Pig Pen Ledges (what a cool place!)<br/>
<br/>
The downpours on Sunday finally dampened our spirits and we headed <br/>
home a bit early but had a wonderful time. What a picturesque part of <br/>
the state! Thanks to all who placed these boxes. <br/>
<br/>
