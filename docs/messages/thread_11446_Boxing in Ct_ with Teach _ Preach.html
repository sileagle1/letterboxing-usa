Chuck.  Sat. we did the Presidential Animals(nice carvings), <br/>
Watership Downs(again nice carvings) &amp; the Ben E Letterbox.  The Ben <br/>
E box was a little wet but everything inside o.k. &amp; last we did the <br/>
Erin Go Braugh.  Very nice series, very well done.  Sun. we started <br/>
at the Mainsfield Depot area with Train Trestle, Great Grape and Rub <br/>
a Dub Dub(that was funny Chuck) all was great but right across from <br/>
the Train Trestle Letterbox was a skelaton of a deer.  Not for <br/>

Swift Passage Hitchhicker(must have just missed TeamGreenDragon), The <br/>
Schoolhouse Letterbox, The Boo Two You Letterbox(The best puzzle <br/>
series), Merrow Park Letterbox, and the 3 Wizards Letterbox(best <br/>
carvings I have seen).  All boxes were in great shape.  Wish we meet <br/>
Leader of the Pack &amp; crew at Merrow Park.  Mon. we finished with <br/>
Inherit The Earth, The Bed Rug, Plane Spotter,Paw Print,Singing Men,&amp; <br/>
The Village(Oxen series)all boxes were great.  We also bought all the <br/>
supplies need for a series that will be at Wolf Den in Pomfret.  We <br/>
have been going up there to get ready for it.  It should be a 22box <br/>
series coming within the next month or so.  Everybody be safe hiking, <br/>

Wolf Den is an excellent area for a series. "Good Woods" around there. I think you have made an excellent choice of an area.You might want to put 1 of them at table rock. Last time I was there the box was in poor condition and no one seemed to know how to contact the owner. It would be a shame not to have one around there. I also like the idea of more boxes in Windham County.<br/>
