                    <div class="plaintext-content">Martha #2 arrived in the midst of an ice and snow storm in Jackson, <br/>
OH this morning.  She was a little put-out that the walks hadn't been <br/>
shoveled for her arrival and she was seen to sniff contemptuously <br/>
when she noted the wind whipped Christmas greenery still in the <br/>
window boxes.  I think she was all geared up when she rang the bell <br/>
to have a little snit when she came in but when she found CardinalMom <br/>
struggling to get her work done online while nursing two sick kids <br/>
and trying not to stumble over the always underfoot old dog she <br/>
relented and pitched in to help.  Before she'd been there an hour, <br/>
she'd put a chicken on to boil for chicken soup, done 2 loads of <br/>
laundry, groomed the dog, and stenciled one of the bathrooms.  When I <br/>
got home she was embroidering a new tablecloth to match the dining <br/>
room chairs she'd reupholstered with leftover material from the new <br/>
dining room cutains she made after lunch.  She's looking a bit worn <br/>
from her travels these past 4 months and I think she was hoping for a <br/>
bit of R&amp;R when she got to our house but after spending the day <br/>
working like a whirlwind and not making much of a dent I think she's <br/>
going to try and get out of town tomorrow if the weather permits.<br/>
