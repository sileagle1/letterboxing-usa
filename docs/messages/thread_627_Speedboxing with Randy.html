around in the woods, then hop in the car for two hours to do it again! Now<br/>
you've got me thinking about box-marathoning. There was just an article in<br/>
our local paper about some insane hikers who got together in a camper and<br/>
did all 6 New Engalnd high peaks in 48 hours. Think of the possibilities!<br/>
You're right about the waterproofing, I managed to get back last week and<br/>
run the last half of the trail backwards and have zip locked two of the four<br/>
boxes. They also need a "what is letterboxing" insert, but that's just an<br/>
excuse to get out now and check your stamp: I'm sure you're the first to<br/>
find that series. Thanks! Jay<br/>

<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BTW, managed to get some time in Exeter RI, on Monday before an<br/>
&gt;otherwise boring business trip to hunt for the Feather in the <br/>
&gt;Cap series  &lt;<snip>&gt;   I ran the flat and downhill trails and it still took me <br/>
&gt;almost four hours  &lt;<snip>&gt;  then, when a sane person would have headed to<br/>
the otherwise boring<br/>
&gt;business hotel, I decided to cruise up to Quabbin for some more <br/>
&gt;trail running and speed letterboxing, and despite spending a good<br/>
&gt;half hour wandering through seemingly shoulder-high ferns being<br/>
&gt;totally off-base, I managed to locate the Moon and Stars box and<br/>
&gt;the Salamander box, and get back before the "hour after sunset"<br/>
&gt;closing of the place.  &lt;<snip>&gt;  my original plan was to then go to<br/>
Sheiling Forest and try to get<br/>
&gt;letterboxes in three states in one day, but it was not to be, mainly<br/>
&gt;due to USAir delays in excess of an hour on a flight that had a<br/>
&gt;flight time of 39 minutes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In any case, thanks Drewclan and Bonnie :-)<br/>
