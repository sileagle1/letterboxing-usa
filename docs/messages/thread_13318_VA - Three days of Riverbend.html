<br/>
Many, many thanks to Mother of Crickets and her encourager Mary for <br/>
persevering and getting us together.  You may think you didn't do <br/>
that much but there we all were!  I have it on good authority from <br/>
our New England visitors that Riverbend rivaled or exceeded any New <br/>
England gathering.<br/>
<br/>
When I arrived at 10:30am I couldn't believe how many people were <br/>
already there.  I guess most like me thought to get ahead of the <br/>
projected rain.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed the great migration from the pavillion.  Since it <br/>
didn't rain it was nicer down under the trees.  And who would have <br/>
wanted to miss Happy Homeschooler's story facing the flock of deer <br/>
stares?<br/>
<br/>
It seemed like someone managed to bring a little of everything.  Just <br/>
when you thought something forgotten you found great food everywhere <br/>
with plates, flatware, drinks, cups and ice.  How did we do that?<br/>
<br/>
I never had so many different colors of ink on my hands at once.  I <br/>
heard Psychomommy say happily she thought she might end up with more <br/>
exchanges than finds at that rate.  I am only sorry I think I saw <br/>
more stamps than faces.  I am glad we had to seek out everyone for <br/>
stamps so at least I had to talk a little to everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
Missed Apple Dumpling Gang, sorry they couldn't make it.  I know <br/>
there are a lot of stamps in the logs in my placed boxes, of people <br/>
in the area who didn't make it either.  Hope to see everyone on the <br/>
trail or in the logs.<br/>
<br/>
It was great to have new people arrive later to start the excitement <br/>
all over again.<br/>
<br/>
Really enjoyed Rich's elvish map, curried chicken, samosas, <br/>
butterfinger cookies, and 3 glorious event stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
Wasn't it great to see Sadie and Russ from CT and Wanda from RI?  <br/>
They stayed for a day or two more and letterboxed with Scarab and <br/>
Night Owl.  Next time less time on big breakfasts and more boxing.  <br/>
We spent a fine day in Leesburg Sunday, and Vienna and Hemlock on <br/>
Monday.  How many of you really wanted to take Monday off?  I took <br/>
the afternoon off anyway.  Did I say how really great Rich's "Day in <br/>
Leesburg" website and tour is?<br/>
<br/>
Sadie figured out my "not so mystery" box without any research or <br/>
knowledge at all and found a stamp in a place never experienced <br/>
before.  Russ offered his cool Kokopelli stamp to help me reach 100 <br/>
and because of it I got a great 100th stamp the next day.  Wanda the <br/>
linguist chattered happily away in many different languages as she <br/>
read the Universal Language clues and we followed clueless.<br/>
<br/>
Wanda made her 2500th find.  It was way cool for her to do that the <br/>
same trip I made my 100th.<br/>
<br/>
Sadie taught me that gore tex boots are the way to go and Russ that <br/>
being out there enjoying it is why we're there.  Wanda taught me to <br/>
set that goal, plan, and go for it.  All three were full of great <br/>
letterboxing stories.  I hope Sadie and Russ return for a DC box tour <br/>
and Wanda and Pete too.  (If only I could have shown them more.)<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that all the original boxing in New England was with <br/>
store bought stamps and hand made stamps only developed later?  I <br/>
have a new appreciation for letterboxing with what ever works for you.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>

<br/>
And here's a few more:   "thank you thank you thank you"!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; great food everywhere<br/>
<br/>
Indeed.  I'd like to nominate the butterfinger cookies as the<br/>
official calorie source for NoVA letterboxing :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I never had so many different colors of ink on my hands at once.<br/>
<br/>
Me too.  In fact, here's another benefit of the gathering, at least<br/>
to me: I got to see the actual stamps of many letterboxers, how they<br/>
manage to carry everything they bring when 'boxing, and what types<br/>
of colors and techniques they use.<br/>
<br/>
Some quick observations...<br/>
- The use of washable felt tip markers (Crayola?) to color in box<br/>
stamps as well as personal stamps never occurred to me.  I forgot who,<br/>
but I saw someone's personal log with very good stamp images, each<br/>
colored in multiple colors.  VERY nice looking.  I'm thinking about<br/>
carrying a few myself.<br/>
- Some personal stamps are a single stamp, but the sides and face are<br/>
carved and stamped separately to build the final personal stamp.<br/>
- I've heard baby wipes work well, but when I saw (Mary?) someone wipe<br/>
the large event stamp completely clean in a second or two after all<br/>
the use it saw, I was a convert!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Wanda made her 2500th find.<br/>
<br/>
Just to confirm, that's 2,500 stamps?  *W*O*W*, that's a TRUE<br/>
BELIEVER!  I have to run home now and see if I exchanged with her.  I<br/>
didn't know I was in the presence of greatness!<br/>
