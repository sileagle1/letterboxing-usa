<p align="center">DPNC Nature Series- Part 2</p>
<p align="left">Head behind the Nature Center and find the trail map. Take the red 
trail to your left and follow the Long Loop. Cross the small wooden bridge and 
stay right. Stop at a red blaze between 2 boulders- 1 next to the trail, the 
other off trail about 14 steps. Go to the off trail boulder. Follow the low 
ledge to the right of the rock. Head around back until you reach a tree with a 
funny knob. Look deep in the ledge by this tree for the Spotted Salamander. </p>
<p align="left">Continue on red. Take the 2nd yellow trail to the right. Then go 
left on red before the bridge/boardwalk. Don't take it to the end, tnstead go 
right on yellow and right behind the pond. Turn left on yellow at the end of the 
pond and then right on red. Go past the short loop and take the long loop again. 
Once on the long loop, turn left on white and go up around the pile of rock and 
ledge. The trail dips down and then up passed the large rock on the left. 
Continue on white, be sure to take the left to stay on white. Cross the bridge 
and look to your left to see the Hidden Pond. In a little while you should go 
straight on yellow to cross the power lines. Head across into the woods to the 
orange trail. At the fork take orange to the right. Carefully follow the orange 
blazes. Soon you will see the "Indian Caves" on your right, on the opposite side 
of a small brook. This is a great place to explore, but not if your looking for 
boxes. Just past the ledges, the trail goes through a stone wall. Step through 
the wall and take 16 steps at 300. Look deep under a flat rock.</p>
<p align="left">Continue on the orange trail past wetlands and a few cool boulder 
jumbles. When you reach the start of the orange trail, go back out under the 
powerlines. This time go right and take the powerline trail. After crossing a 
small, possibly seasonal brook, head up hill. Stop where a stone wall to the 
right is perpendicular to the trail. There is a small cedar at the end and a 
dead tree marked 193. Look left for an old double stump. About 2 feet to the 
right, under a flat ledge like stone, and behind a pink stone you will find the 
DPNC letterbox.</p>
<p align="left">Follow the orange trail back into the woods. You are now on your 
way back to the nature center. Keep your eyes peeled for a dead tree stump on 
the right. Look behind it , tucked in rock, to find the Red-Winged Blackbird. 
</p>
<p align="left">To return to the nature center, stay on this trail. Take a right 
at the Y and another right on red. </p></div></body></html>
