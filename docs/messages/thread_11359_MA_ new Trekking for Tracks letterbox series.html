new series.  More clues will be added as more boxes are planted.   <br/>
<br/>
Trekking for Tracks Series  placed by gbheron<br/>
Wachusett Meadow Wildlife Sanctuary<br/>
Town: Princeton, MA <br/>
County:Worcester <br/>
<br/>
Permission to plant these boxes has been granted by the director of <br/>
this Audubon sanctuary.  However, he did request that he and other <br/>
staff members not be approached with questions regarding these <br/>
letterboxes. He also emphasized the importance of observing the <br/>
sanctuary rules, namely: 1. That letterboxers stay on the trails.  <br/>
(All boxes are no more than a few paces off trail.)  2.  No dogs are <br/>
allowed.  3. Cross-country skiing and mountain bikes are not allowed. <br/>
4. All non-members pay the $3 or $4 fee. (Massachusetts Audubon <br/>
members  free.)  This sanctuary offers various wildlife habitats, <br/>
beautiful views, peaceful viewing areas, and nearly 13 miles of <br/>
trails.  Be sure to pick up a trail map outside the visitor center <br/>
before heading out.<br/>
<br/>
Getting There: From Rt. 2 follow Rt. 31 South to Princeton town <br/>
common.  From the flashing light intersection of Rtes 62 and 31 (on <br/>
top of the hill), [ follow Rte 62 West .75 miles to the Mass. Audubon <br/>
sign on the right.  Turn right onto Goodnow Road and proceed 1 mile <br/>
to the Wachusett Meadow parking area on the left.]  From Worcester <br/>
area, take Rte 190 from Rte 290.  From Rte 190, take Rte 140 North.  <br/>
In 2 miles, take a left onto Rte 62 West to flashing light <br/>
intersection of Rtes 62 and 31 in Princeton center. Follow directions <br/>
in [ ] above.<br/>
<br/>
1. The Fierce Fisher<br/>
Planted on 3/20/03<br/>
<br/>
Start out heading north through the Visitor center breezeway.   Head <br/>
westerly on North Meadow Trail.  You may want to pay your respects to <br/>
the Crocker Maple that was felled by an early winter ice storm in the <br/>
Fall of 2002.  Pick up the trail that starts at the northern end of <br/>
the meadow and head toward the summit for just a bit.  Veer off to <br/>
the right, looping around Brown Hill.  Pass the Otter pond on your <br/>
right and wind your way uphill through a forest that is dominated by <br/>
shaggy bark hickory trees.  An opening in a stone wall is marked on <br/>
the left by a large one of these trees.  Step between the tree and <br/>
the wall.  You may notice the empty shells of hickory nuts left on <br/>
the stone wall, perhaps by a red squirrel. Beneath a large rock in <br/>
the wall, pieces of bark shed from the hickory hide The Fierce Fisher <br/>
Letterbox. You will not need to move any rocks to find it. This <br/>
predator may look gentle but is fierce enough to deliberately hunt <br/>
porcupines! Though she's often referred to as a `fisher cat', she is <br/>
a member of the weasel family and is as comfortable in trees as she <br/>
is on the ground. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Moose on the Loose<br/>
	Planted on 3/22/03<br/>
<br/>
The Moose on the Loose, an excellent swimmer, wandered to the beaver <br/>
swamp on the sanctuary's western border to graze on water plants and <br/>
sip tall drink of water.  A tree of 7 trunks shaded his left flank <br/>
before he plunged in and moved on.  To find him, look across the <br/>
swamp to the path on the other side.  Take a bearing in this <br/>
direction, and turn back towards the trail you just came down.   <br/>
Divide the bearing by 7 and walk this many paces back up the trail.  <br/>
A large hollowed out tree stump leans toward the trail, giving away <br/>
his hiding spot.  If you don't find him it's because his keen sense <br/>
of  smell warned of your coming  a mile away!<br/>
<br/>
(Note: The trail to this box, though wide, was virtually a stream bed <br/>
for several yards after an unusually snowy winter.  Unless you have <br/>
watertight boots, or don't mind getting your feet wet up to your <br/>
ankles, do not attempt this hike in early spring.)<br/>
