&gt; I think we need to clarify our terminology. There are several <br/>
&gt; federal land agencies with a variety of purposes.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; National Parks are foremost to "preserve" a national treasure - <br/>
&gt; sometimes natural &amp; scenic; sometimes historic.  In National Parks <br/>
&gt; there is no hunting, no oil drilling, no timber cutting.  In this <br/>
&gt; day &amp; age when environmental issues have very low priority with our <br/>
&gt; government most parks are in a sad state.  Visitor numbers continue <br/>
&gt; to rise but with budget cuts there is less money for maintenance to <br/>
&gt; stay nothing of upgrading facilities or even maintaining adequate <br/>
&gt; staff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; National Forests run by an entirely different agency, the US Forest <br/>
&gt; Service in the Department of Agriculture, are managed for multiple <br/>
&gt; use.  Such uses include extractive activities such as mining &amp; <br/>
&gt; logging, hunting, trapping as well as recreational activities such <br/>
&gt; as camping, hiking, wildlife watching, skiing, snowmobiling and so <br/>
&gt; forth.  In general Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands are managed <br/>
&gt; similar to national forests for multiple use.  There is also a whole <br/>
&gt; other class of federal property - National Wildlife Refuges.  They <br/>
&gt; often have restrictions to protect the wildlife they are managing <br/>
&gt; but also encourage visitors &amp; I plan to place some boxes at several <br/>
&gt; refuges in my area this summer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As with cemetaries it would be possible to encourage people to visit <br/>
&gt; national parks to get information that they need to solve the clues <br/>
&gt; &amp; then hide the box itself in another nearby location.  I know that <br/>
&gt; they are in fact geocaches in national parks but they are "virtual" <br/>
&gt; caches where the person has to obtain information from a sign &amp; <br/>
&gt; relay it to the cache placer to get credit for the find.  There is <br/>
&gt; no actual box at the location.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay I'll get off my soap box now &amp; go back to carving a stamp for <br/>
&gt; my wildlife refuge box.<br/>

up their rear ends for anyone who does anything on their land other than<br/>
gawk at wildlife in a federally approved manner. They should be avoided.<br/>
<br/>
The NWR regulations quoted make searching as much a crime as placing, since<br/>
a letterbox would be covered by the phrasing "ANY personal property" and<br/>
"treasure trove". IMO, that makes posting a false clue (someone suggested<br/>
that to annoy NWR and NPS managers) a horrid idea, since not every<br/>
letterboxer who might see the false clue will have seen this thread and know<br/>
that they were about to commit an act of civil disobedience.<br/>
<br/>
16USC668dd, 50CFR 27.93, Abandonment of Property Abandoning, discarding, or<br/>
otherwise leaving any personal property in any national wildlife refuge is<br/>
prohibited.<br/>
16USC668dd 50CFR 27.63 Search for and removal of other valued objects - (a)<br/>
No person shall search for buried treasure, treasure trove, valuable<br/>
semi-precious rocks, stones, or mineral specimens on national wildlife<br/>
refuges unless authorized by permit or by provision of this subchapter C.<br/>
<br/>
Some geocachers have compiled a list of all known policies (good or bad)<br/>
from various park systems. The site is geocachingpolicy.com. From a park<br/>
perspective, letterboxing would be covered by the same rules, since both<br/>
hobbies involve leaving a container in a park to be hunted. One point of<br/>
speculation about this site: Most areas that are unlisted are likely to be<br/>
OK since any park system that restricts caching and LBing should have been<br/>
discovered and discussed in caching forums by now. That's not a guarantee,<br/>
but an educated guess. They do update frequently as rules change.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing.<br/>

Thanks Mike - the site is a great resource.  Interesting that ny <br/>
local NWR employee didn't know his own department's policy.  I <br/>
suppose I should point it out to him <vbg><br/>

<br/>
How does that make searching for a letterbox illegal?  I'll grant <br/>
that 'treasure trove' isn't defined and letterboxers might consider a <br/>
box a 'treasure trove', but others (including the NPS) call it <br/>
litter.  If I'm a huge collector of candy wrappers and I found a <br/>
prime example of a Snicker's wrapper on NWR land--does it make it <br/>
illegal for me to pick it up and keep it?<br/>
<br/>
It's a contrived example, but letterboxing doesn't strike me as a <br/>
whole lot different.  Everyone NOT in this hobby looks at letterboxes <br/>
like we look at candy wrappers--trash.<br/>
<br/>
And then looking at their list of stuff people aren't supposed to <br/>
search for: "No person shall search for buried treasure, treasure <br/>
trove, valuable semi-precious rocks, stones, or mineral specimens on <br/>
national wildlife."  Notice a recurring theme?  All of the items they <br/>
refer to have some sort of monetary value.  Which letterboxes do not <br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
One other note about the rules: This could be just a 'legal <br/>
technicality', but the rule clearly states the 'search for AND <br/>
REMOVAL of other valued objects....'  If you don't remove it, is it <br/>
still illegal?  And would the NWR consider a letterbox a 'valued <br/>
object'?  Sure doesn't sound that way considering they don't want us <br/>
putting them out there.<br/>
<br/>
Hiding letterboxes in such locations is clearly illegal, but I <br/>
haven't seen anything to suggest that LOOKING for them is illegal, <br/>
nor that creating 'imaginary boxes' is illegal.<br/>
