planting boxes that are less likely to "die?"  Do you find, for <br/>
instance, that this happens more with boxes close to roads and/or easy <br/>

&gt;  It IS! I just hate when that happens. And that it's part of the <br/>

&gt;  doesn't do a thing to comfort me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Even harder when it's your first one! As many boxes as I've lost <br/>
&gt; (and it's<br/>
&gt;  50% of what I've planted), at least I've been able to console myself <br/>
&gt; that my<br/>
&gt;  first plant is still there and fairly successful.<br/>

<br/>
In my experience, the more visited a box is, the more likely it is to <br/>
die.  And the more public the box is, the more likely it is to die.<br/>
<br/>
You hide a box out on a 20-mile hike in the middle of Alaska, and <br/>
it's likely to last for a very, very long time....  =)<br/>

So, Ryan, what's the longest hike to one of your boxes?<br/>

<br/>
You know, I'm not sure.  =)  A lot of those boxes I hid on the AT I'm <br/>
not sure how far away the nearest trail head is, so I really have <br/>
little idea how difficult or not some of those boxes are!  For ME it <br/>
might have been a LONG hike, but some weekender might have come up <br/>
from another trailhead a couple of miles down the trail and hardly be <br/>
breaking a sweat for all I know.<br/>
<br/>
The farthest I know somebody has hiked for one of my boxes was the <br/>
Cockroach box I planted in Tennessee.  They went on a 20 or 30 mile <br/>
backpacking trip, and found that box along the way.  (Only people to <br/>
have found it, I might add.)<br/>
<br/>
For hikes that I know the nearest trailheads to, the toughest would <br/>
be Nesmith Point--about a ten mile hike up a VERY steep mountain with <br/>
a 3,000 foot elevation gain.  (I can probably count on my fingers the <br/>
number of people who've gotten this box.)<br/>
<br/>
So, to make a long story short--I don't know!  =)<br/>
