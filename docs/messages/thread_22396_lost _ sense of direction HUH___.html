                    <div class="plaintext-content">Evolution my dear, some things we kept, some we lost. Birds use<br/>
several mechanisms some of which we retain some of which we don't.<br/>
Birds use photoperiodism, the lengthening and shortening of days in<br/>
spring and autumn, which affects birds' pituitary and pineal glands.<br/>
These glands generate hormones that stimulate birds to become<br/>
increasingly restless. Daytime migratory birds use vision to steer by<br/>
the sun, aided by a precise sense of time (see photoperiodism). Night<br/>
fliers take compass cues from star patterns. While in flight, birds<br/>
may use geographic land forms to help them orient direction and<br/>
course. The outline of North American coasts, and the north-south<br/>
direction of many large rivers and mountain chains, aid in migration.<br/>
Many of these we use along with our cognitive ability as previously<br/>
mentioned. Homing pigeons and some migratory birds see ultraviolet and<br/>
polarized light to assist their migration, an ability which we<br/>
lack...birds got it, we didn't. Birds such as sparrows, pigeons,<br/>
bobolinks and others can detect magnetic fields; cells in the bird's<br/>
brain contain magnetite, an iron oxide crystal that aligns with<br/>
magnetic north similar to a compass needle. Evidence suggests that<br/>
these cells may serve as receptors that send directional information<br/>
to the brain. Human's brains which have been extensively studied lack<br/>
these specialized cells as do many other migratory birds that do not<br/>
have the ability to use magnetic fields to navigate. Our noses<br/>
certainly don't contain these specialized cells. Applying a thorough<br/>
knowledge of anatomy, physiology and physics; even if you pureed the<br/>
noses of people who scored higher on tests of wayfinding and found<br/>
a higher iron content than the people who scored low, how would you<br/>
propose that this influences navigational ability? The force of the<br/>
earth's magnetic field is 0.00005 tesla (tesla is a measure of<br/>
magnetic field strength) where as that of a strong refrigerator magnet<br/>
is 0.1 tesla so the earth's pull on your "ironic" nose, even if your<br/>
nose were solid iron, wouldn't come close to generating enough force<br/>
to register in any of the proprioceptors in your neck (proprioceptors<br/>
are the nerve endings in joints that tell you the pressure on joint<br/>
cartilage, this information is coordinated with the anatomic position<br/>
of the joint and processed along with information on the tension on<br/>
muscles and tendons to give you the ability to know the position of<br/>
your body or in this case your head even with your eyes closed as well<br/>
as a sense of the vector of external forces acting on your head.)<br/>
Remember we lack the cells with the specialized intracellular<br/>
structure to give us information on the position of iron oxide<br/>
crystals with in the cell. Sensory input to the brain from the nose is<br/>
mediated through the Trigeminal nerve. Trigeminal nerve disorders are<br/>
well documented and studied and a quick Google search yielded no<br/>
indication that people who have damaged Trigeminal nerves loose their<br/>
sense of direction.<br/>
<br/>
Humans have a significant ability to adapt to different climates and<br/>
don't have a need to migrate and therefore did not evolve any<br/>
specialized tissues or structures to aid in this, birds and other<br/>
animals do and have evolved various mechanisms which we lack. We still<br/>
must rely our cognitive abilities for navigation.<br/>

&gt; It did used to be scientific fact that this was impossible....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it was occouring how could it simultaneously be impossible?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow. Scientists theorize that monarchs have two systems that aid<br/>
them in their migration. One is the ability to use the sun as a<br/>
compass. In scientific studies, monarchs tricked with artificial<br/>
lights into believing that the time is off just by a few hours will<br/>
alter the direction of their flight upon release, according to where<br/>
the sun "should" be.<br/>
<br/>
Yet many scientists believe that, since monarchs can travel 90 miles<br/>
or more in a day, they must be able to fly at night, without the<br/>
benefit of the sun to orient them. Hence they believe that monarchs<br/>
also fly by following magnetic fields. The diet of monarch larvae is<br/>
almost exclusively milkweed plant, from which the caterpillars<br/>
biosynthesize magnetite (see previous post). <br/>
