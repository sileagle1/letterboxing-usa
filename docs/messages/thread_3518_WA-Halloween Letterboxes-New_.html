The Red Town Trailhead, is also the site of a former mining town.  In <br/>
1883, the town had 750 residents and produced coal for steamships, <br/>
railroads and the city of San Francisco.  Prospectors and coal miners <br/>
worked Cougar Mountain for nearly 100 years, digging coal, waste rock <br/>
and clay.  The town was called "Red Town" because  the houses were <br/>
all painted the same shade of red.  I chose this "ghost town" for my <br/>
Halloween letterboxes.<br/>
