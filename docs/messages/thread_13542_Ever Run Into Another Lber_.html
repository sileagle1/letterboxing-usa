                    <div class="plaintext-content">We run into a few people from time to time.What we did to be more noticeable is we bought 2x3" Letters like the kind you might put on your mailbox and put NEEDEEPS on our back window of the car.It's funny how many people ask us what that means,one time we where pulled over on the side of the road reading the map and some guy went by us and turned around and came back and asked us what was wrong.And I looked at him then I looked at Kathy then looked back at him and said nothing why do you ask,and he replied then why do you have a sign in your back window that says NEED HELP.I just laughed and said it says NEEDEEPS not NEED HELP but he did not understand what NEEDEEPS meant,so I just told him that I belong to a hiking club and that was our trail name something like a CB handle.Another time we had a State Trooper pull us over and he was laughing and asked us what NEEDEEPS meant,he thought it was our last name.On the trail you can sometimes tell a Letterboxer because they look like they are always trying to hide something,like the cat that just swallowed the canary.Lenny/Kathy The NeeDeeps <br/>

letterboxer on the trails here in Colorado.  I mean ... it would have <br/>
to be someone on vacation from Connecticut or something!  hehe!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I think it would be a real kick to meet someone along the <br/>
trail and stop for a stamp exchange with them.  I still think I'd <br/>
pass out, though!<br/>

attract much attention  *lol*)  <br/>
