hunt for your boxes next spring when I'm out visiting in Cincy. <br/>
I can see you have a well trained dog. Now if he/she could carve you <br/>
could make a fortune! :-)<br/>
  I did the same thing with my favorite stamp. That is, forgot to <br/>
make a copy of it. Of all my stamps it happened to be one of a dog. I <br/>
will have to go back to the box to make my copy. Yeah, live and learn!<br/>
