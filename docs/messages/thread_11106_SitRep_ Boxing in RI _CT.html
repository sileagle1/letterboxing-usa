                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks TeamGreen Dragon for the note. I will add some pages to the log <br/>
book next week. I just checked and there is still room to tuck in a <br/>
stamp here and there !! This is a up front NOTICE that the Rocky Neck <br/>
Series, Winter Camping is For the Birds, will be pulled from the <br/>
campgrounds next month. It is much too busy durning the camping season <br/>
to have letterboxers searching.  However all the other boxes will stay <br/>
in the park and at last count there are close to 20. And--somewhere is <br/>
the Thumbs Up  H.H. that finally got a ride having been in my back pack <br/>
more than a month, unable to get past snow and ice.   Enjoy--and FYI <br/>
--most of the snow is gone from Rocky Neck.!! Come on down !!<br/>
