<div>Lions Club Fields ( soccer )</div>

<div>Take Rte 195 to Rte 89 at Mansfield Center, Pass 
the library, the school and over the dike the road to the field is on the left. 
( also road to dump) .</div>

<div>Margaret Wise Brown wrote Goodnight Moon and thousands of 
children have dropped off to sleep hearing her comforting words. </div>
<div>    " In the great green room   
there was a telephone    and a  red balloon  
</div>
<div>and a picture  of -    the cow jumping 
over the moon......."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Drive in to the Y bear right it is a dirt road that takes you 
to the playing fields. near the gate find a place to park. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When facing the gate take a bearing of 320 degrees head off in 
that direction.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The lane is clear with soccer field to the side and a row of 
unearthed boulders keeping vehicles off the grass. There is one bend in the 
boulder lane then look for a small tree marked " Boundry Line" .  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Stand in the lane between the boundry marker and a line of 
vision to the service building way across the fields. Turn your back on the 
building and take a bearing of 200degrees. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Along this line spy a woodpeckers delight, walk to the 
peckerwood . When we arrived here Gemma the dog barked and barked!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Stamp privately and rehide, hope you enjoyed this walk, and 
the story .</div>
