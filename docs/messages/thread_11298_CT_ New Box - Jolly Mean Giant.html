Placed by: Michael and Janet<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
Date: March 15, 2003<br/>
City: Hamden<br/>
County: New Haven<br/>
State: CT<br/>
<br/>
This box was placed at Sleeping Giant State Park in<br/>
Hamden, CT. It's the first in a series remembering the<br/>
Topps collectors card series, Wacky Packages.<br/>
This is a short easy walk, except when the trail is<br/>
coated with melting ice and you're being dragged along<br/>
by 2 dogs, but a quick one to pick up if you're in the<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don't remember, these were die<br/>
cuts and stickers marketed to children in the 70's <br/>
poking fun with parody at product advertising.<br/>
<br/>
To get to the starting point, follow the directions<br/>
outlined in the first paragraph of Lobsta Lady's<br/>
Cascades Letterbox.<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/ma/cascade.htm<br/>
This will also help give you a clue as to what the<br/>
following sequence means.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the sequence outlined here to find the Jolly<br/>
Mean Giant.<br/>
<br/>
XU^ X UX&lt; U X ~ X U X U X X U X U X U UX&gt; X X X X XX&lt; X<br/>
X <br/>
<br/>
When you reach the last X (if you don't see any more Xs<br/>
for a long time, you went to far. Turn around and go<br/>
back to the last X you saw.) look directly to your<br/>
left. You should see a group of fallen trees layed out<br/>
in parallel. Follow these trunks for 22 steps (until<br/>
you reach the end) and have a look under the base of<br/>
these trunks.<br/>
<br/>
Here you'll find a carving of classic Wacky Packages<br/>
die cut sticker, the Jolly Mean Giant. Stamp in and<br/>
enjoy the rest of your day.<br/>
