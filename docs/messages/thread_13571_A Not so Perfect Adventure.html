                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was at the Black Rock Mill a few weeks ago. There are 2 other boxes there. One I didn't know about and the other I couldn't find, but I did grab the Ultimate Walker. Pretty area and I went on a cool dryish day, so the bugs weren't bad. I imagine they will be worse now, but I want to go back and try for the two I missed.<br/>
