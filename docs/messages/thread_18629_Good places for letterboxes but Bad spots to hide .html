<br/>
	Today we did a quick hike to "Boulder Rock" to check up on the condition<br/>
of our letterbox.   The main problem is that the box is hidden under the<br/>
ground level with a rock on it and this causes water to seep into the<br/>
box. The  brown ink pad was all wet and it got onto the edges of the<br/>
notepad.  Anyway I put a new multicolored ink pad in its place.<br/>
	On April 12 (my birthday) an entry was made in the book and thanks to<br/>
those who put in a small absorbent blue paper towel in the letterbox to<br/>
absorb water- saved the box from total ruin. I've added 6 new maps in the<br/>
box to be claimed when the box is found again.<br/>
	But back to the problem.  Even though this is a good site , where the<br/>
box is placed is  nasty . The box is surrounded by ground of  peat moss<br/>
consistency with a flat stone on top.  Maybe it should be moved to a<br/>
better place but the previous time it had been "under" Boulder Rock and<br/>
some how it vanished!<br/>
	Anyway Jill &amp; I argued about this for a while before we left. She thinks<br/>
it should be in a better (drier) place but I put it back in it's  (wet)<br/>
place next to that log again.  [ If it gets we now it will color the<br/>
notepad]  <br/>
