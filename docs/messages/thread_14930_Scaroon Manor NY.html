Letterbox.  It was well worth the time we spent looking for it - the <br/>
majestic white pines and the stone work were magnificant.<br/>
This was our first letterbox find and we are hooked.  Unbelievable how <br/>
someone my age could get so excited over such a simple thing but my <br/>
daughter and I both giggled with glee when we finally figured out the <br/>
directions and uncovered the box.<br/>
