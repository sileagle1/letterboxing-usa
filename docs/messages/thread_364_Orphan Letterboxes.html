&gt;  Orphans (or is there another name for a box like this?:<br/>
&gt;  I'm just wondering how many of our letterboxes are<br/>
&gt;  orphan letterboxes.... that is, placed with no intention<br/>
&gt;  of following up on its condition etc.<br/>
&gt;  Should we know before looking for it that it is an orphan?<br/>
&gt;  That is, if the box is listed on the L-USA site should it<br/>
&gt;  be designated as orphan online and searchers could take<br/>
&gt;  extra supplies to replace full journals, etc.? How long should<br/>
&gt;  an orphan box be listed? If no one has ever found it or looked<br/>
&gt;  for it, how will we know it's still there? Since most letterboxes here<br/>
&gt;  are few and far between so far, it makes sense to me that there<br/>
&gt;  be some kind of policy in place for listing them.<br/>
<br/>
These are all really good questions, worth thinking about I think.<br/>
I think personally, I am going to keep the number of boxes I place<br/>
to a minimum of about 3 or 4 and I will make sure they are not so<br/>
far away that I cannot check on them easily.  Or else, (here's a<br/>
good one, I think) I would try to have a contact or fellow<br/>
letterboxer who I know of who is near the remote ones.  Does that<br/>
make some sense?  I just don't think its a good idea to have lots<br/>
of letterboxes listed as though they are there when, in fact, they<br/>
may not be.  I hope this is not a bad time to be bringing this up.<br/>
Actually we did talk about this last year early in the game.  But<br/>
I think the recent enthusiasm of planting boxes has preempted most<br/>
other considerations.  Its something at least to think about.<br/>
Perhaps while in Greenland you could find a kind soul at the pub<br/>
who might live close by to where your box will be hidden and will<br/>
be willing to go out say, once every 6 months to see if its still<br/>
there?  I'm just thinking off the top of my head head here...<br/>
<br/>
At one time I thought, well... it would be enough if every person<br/>
(who decides to plant a box) just plants one in his or her own<br/>
neigborhood...  Again, just thinking off the top of my head...<br/>
I don't want to limit the hobby.  I know some of the people in<br/>
Dartmoor have dozens of boxes out, maybe more.  But like I've<br/>
said all along we have a unique case here geographically, culturally,<br/>
and taking into consideration the media for clues sharing it <br/>
presents us with opportunities aplenty to evolve in a different<br/>
direction.  What about the corner pub, library, grocer, mall,<br/>
or parking lot?  Do we have to hide them in grass, dirt, logs<br/>
or moss or under rocks or in crevices?  What about the back<br/>
seat of an old Edsel?  I think the important thing is to make<br/>
it fun, respect the land and property of others, and make it<br/>
safe.  But certainly we don't want a lot of boxes that may be<br/>
orphaned.  That might sour people if they get clues, go out<br/>
and look, realize they have the spot precisely located and <br/>
realize there is no letterbox.  On the other hand, perhaps the<br/>
unwritten code would be as Deborah mentioned, to keep supplies<br/>
on hand to sort of readopt the letterbox.  But what would happen<br/>
if say, you think its missing but you're really at the wrong spot?<br/>
Would you ever know for sure if you should readopt it?  Only<br/>
the hider or someone else who has been given an exact location<br/>
would know for sure where the box should be.  Lots of things<br/>
to consider hear...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  More semantics:<br/>
&gt;     Is there an official Dartmoor word for putting a letterbox<br/>
&gt;  out? I have always used the word "place"; I notice that<br/>
&gt;  others use "plant".... just curious.<br/>
<br/>
Plant, place plop, salt, spot, locate, put, throw out, hide, plug...<br/>
etc., etc., etc...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  It would be fun to have a "letterbox lingo list" ~ to introduce<br/>
&gt;  and define words like "stamping up", etc.<br/>
&gt;  Deborah<br/>
<br/>
I thought you were working on that.  If anyone does such a list<br/>
I will put it on the site, prolly on the getting started page.<br/>
