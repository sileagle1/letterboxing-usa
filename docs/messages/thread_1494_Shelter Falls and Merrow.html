the one that went astray. Thanks to all that stamped in on the  info <br/>
sheet to keep things going.  <br/>
  We also visited and collected the  Merrow Park box. It is a great <br/>
spot. I really enjoyed it, especially knowing it came from a 4-H <br/>
family.  Some others came along  after us it was like a letterboxing <br/>
party. Thanks all for the fun. Carol<br/>
