It is highly unlikely that it was a setup because posting clues to a<br/>
letterbox and then laying in wait is a very inefficient way to commit<br/>
criminal acts.  The perpetrator may have had to wait a day, a week, or a<br/>
month.  Some boxes go months without visitors!  I guess the only reason I<br/>
might believe you were set up is if you contacted the placer and said "My<br/>
family is going to be looking for your box this evening" - if that happened,<br/>
then maybe it was a setup.  Otherwise, no...<br/>
<br/>
May I suggest that you try again, and this time find a box or two not quite<br/>
so rural so you can get your feet under you again and not feel nervous?<br/>
Letterboxing is truly a wonderful activity and the vast majority of<br/>
experiences are very good.  You pulled a bad draw this time, but you never<br/>
know, one of these days you may go back and find that same box and be glad<br/>
you stuck with it.<br/>

a good one.  I don't believe that what happened to you in this <br/>
unfortunate case is representative of letterboxing overall. It seems <br/>
that you were the victim of some pathetic people, but it may very <br/>
well have nothing to do with letterboxing at all.  While the clues <br/>
may have been vague, some people do that on purpose to make their <br/>
boxes harder to find. I've looked for some boxes were the clues were <br/>
certainly less than ideal.  Most people would probably have to see <br/>
the clues and visit the location to know for sure. Unless the clues <br/>
were really a joke.  In addition, if it was a letterbox ruse, the <br/>
perpetraitors would have to be waiting a long time to catch someone <br/>
out on "the hunt".  You never know when someone's going to be looking <br/>
for a box - unless they post in a chat room before hand- the time <br/>
they are going and the place they are going to. It may just have been <br/>
an all too common act of stupidity and theft as opposed to an attempt <br/>
to use letterboxing to rob people.  At least I hope that this <br/>
activity is not being used in that manner.  Even though the <br/>
experience was not a good one, hopefully you will try letterboxing <br/>
again in the future, maybe in a different area.  Anyway, they'll <br/>
probably get what they deserve in the end.  -John<br/>

I doubt it was a set up though.  Probably it's a place that bad guys often<br/>
break into cars because people go walking there, but that is was connected<br/>
to the letterbox in any way... that I would seriously doubt.<br/>
<br/>
Please please give it another try.  Be sure to pick a box that has been<br/>
recently found, that way you know (as a newbie) that it should be there.<br/>
And try to find clues that are more direct, save the harder ones for later!<br/>
<br/>
Could you let us know what box exactly it was so that the owner can decide<br/>
if they want to put a note in the clues about what happened to you?<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure it put a bad taste in your mouth, and your husband's about<br/>
letterboxing.  But this is a wonderful, fun, exciting, interesting, hobby.<br/>
It's worth trying again.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi K,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing!  If you think about it, letterboxing is really no<br/>
more unsafe than any other activity you'd be doing in whatever area forest<br/>
preserve you went to. Thank God it was your car that was damaged and not<br/>
your or any of your family.<br/>
<br/>
Cook County forest preserves can present more than the usual amount of<br/>
problems because they're both secluded, so you can easily end up in an area<br/>
where nobody will hear you scream or, if they do, they're not about to help<br/>
you anyway, and since Cook County is so urban and so populated, there are<br/>
likely to be far more "weirdos" and "sickos" abounding.  There are also a<br/>
lot of homeless people who live in forest preserves, about 1/3 of the<br/>
homeless population are emotionally disturbed in some form or another, and<br/>
they can become both very upset if they feel people might be coming too<br/>
close to where they've stashed their possessions and also can tend to break<br/>
into vehicles looking for cash or anything they can sell quickly.<br/>
<br/>
If you're not used to keeping an eye out for yourself in a forest preserve<br/>
setting, you might want to try some of the DuPage County boxes first to get<br/>
a feel for it.  Not that ANY preserve is totally safe, tho.  I had the<br/>
scariest boxing "adventure" of my life so far out on Johnson's Mound in Kane<br/>
County, a box planted by the now-apparently-defunct Gray Family 5.  And I've<br/>
always felt that Kane County's preserves were pretty darn safe.<br/>
<br/>
You mention "night."  I'm hoping that means you're not boxing in the Cook<br/>
County forest preserves after dark.  Not wise.  If you're talking, "night",<br/>
as in maybe early evening, after work and before the sun goes down, I still<br/>
wouldn't go on a Thursday evening.<br/>
<br/>
The only box somewhat in your area that I definitely would NOT attempt<br/>
unless you've got your wills updated is the one that takes in Bachelor's<br/>
Grove Cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
My own personal opinions about Cook County forest preserves are that the<br/>
"safest" boxing has been on weekend mid-mornings and early afternoons.<br/>
Monday thru Friday SEEM great as far as being able to search for boxes with<br/>
oftentimes few people around to really be watching what you're doing and<br/>
risk muggles harming the box.  But there often aren't enough people around<br/>
to hope to help out if there IS going to be a problem.  Thursday, Friday,<br/>
and Saturday evenings, the gangs, drug sellers, party crowds with the<br/>
alcohol, etc. tend to come out.  I do not box in the Cook County preserves<br/>
on those evenings.  But, in this weather, Saturday and Sunday, the gang<br/>
folks, drug folks, etc. are often all sleeping in from the night before,<br/>
plus the "weekend warriors" and "weekend R&amp;Rers" come out -- people fishing,<br/>
boating, biking, jogging, taking hikes with the kids, etc. -- so altho<br/>
discretion can be much harder, I think the safety factor is way up. Just<br/>
have to be more careful, tho, that people don't decide to investigate just<br/>
what it is that you're doing.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone else's mileage may vary, obviously, this is just what I've found in<br/>
the Cook County preserves.  A lot of the preserves have beefed up police and<br/>
ranger patrols, but they're still spread pretty thin and it's almost<br/>
impossible for them sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
And there are some nice boxes out there in both DuPage and Cook Counties<br/>
which aren't in forest preserves.  You might have to travel further to get<br/>
to them.  I don't know if any of them are in your neck of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
It's highly unlikely it would be a set-up.  I think probably even if you<br/>
weren't letterboxing, the car would have ended up being broken into.  This<br/>
was your first letterboxing experience.  There can be a biiiig learning<br/>
curve to letterboxing.  Clues that might seem really vague to you now, you<br/>
might kick yourself a year down the road that you didn't see what the clues<br/>
meant.<br/>
<br/>
And on the other hand, if the box was placed by someone relatively<br/>
inexperienced, placing a letterbox has a biiiig learning curve too.  The<br/>
more a person does it, the better they (hopefully) will become at writing<br/>
clues.  And then some people DO intentionally write vague clues.  I like<br/>
difficult clues.  But I heartily dislike vague clues.  Because I don't like<br/>
to go tromping thru woods and possibly hurt fragile environments<br/>
unnecessarily.  Sometimes when you're just starting out boxing, it might be<br/>
better to look for a box that's been planted by someone who seems to have<br/>
more experience.  Or maybe post before going searching, to get opinions on<br/>
the box.  I'm not talking about "hints" or giving away any secrets or<br/>
anything, but just to see if it might be a good box for a newbie?<br/>
<br/>
Was this box on LbNA?  The only two boxes for Orland Park on LbNA are<br/>
Howling Coyote's "Shake! Shake! Shake!", which has good clues and a great<br/>
stamp -- I loved that stamp! -- and Tiptoe and Tonto's Cicada Mania, which I<br/>
had intended to go looking for this Sunday but the clues for that one don't<br/>
really seem vague at all, tho it certainly looks like a compass is<br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you decide to take another stab at letterboxing once you've<br/>
recovered somewhat and want to meet up some Sunday early to mid-morning or<br/>
so, email me privately.<br/>

My sisters, my son and I have been very excited to get started with<br/>

<br/>
I had just bought this car on Tuesday.  How devastating.<br/>
<br/>
My husband feels that this could have been a set up.  Get people to<br/>

won't be doing this again.<br/>

<br/>
FWIW, I always lock my purse out of sight in the trunk of the car <br/>
before heading off on a hike or 'boxing expedition.  I kind of agree <br/>
with the other respondants here; it's unlikely this LB was a set-up <br/>
specifically for this purpose.  HOWEVER - it's always a good idea to <br/>
not leave anything of value visable in your parked car.  <br/>
<br/>
Most likely, some teens know that people go hiking there, and hit the <br/>
trailhead parking to see what's there for an easy smash-and-grab.  In <br/>
fact, now that I think about it, I remember last summer visiting <br/>
friends in Texas - we went boxing in a Nature Preserve and there was <br/>
signage warning us about this very thing.  AND lots of broken window <br/>
glass in the parking lot.  A sad state of affairs...<br/>
<br/>
I am glad you and your family are safe - please remember, that is the <br/>
most important thing!  Good luck in the future, and I hope you do <br/>
reconsider and give letterboxing another try!<br/>

Hi there!  Welcome to letterboxing.  Please do not let this <br/>
experience stop you from this great hobby/game/adventure.  I'm sure <br/>
that this tragedy occurring at the same time as your first hunt is a <br/>
major coincidence.<br/>
<br/>
I just looked at the clues for the box ( I think) you were looking <br/>
for.  The placers of that box are well known and respected, They've <br/>
been around for a while.  I do not know them personally,but I've seen <br/>
their name lots and lots.  This isn't their only planted box.  So, I <br/>
really doubt this was a set up.  I have heard of one box that was a <br/>
set up to get funny videos of people for youtube.  But, the placement <br/>
of the box you're talking about doesn't sound likely as a place for a <br/>
setup.  As a planter, you really have no way of knowing how or when <br/>
someone is going to show up to find a box. It could be tomorrow, or <br/>
next week, or three months, or in the case of some harder boxes... <br/>
years or never.  Unless maybe you had a camera staked out and could <br/>
monitor it and get there really quickly, you'd never know when <br/>
someone may show up.  That doesn't seem very likely.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming I'm looking at the right box clues, they don't seem overly <br/>
vague to me.  But, remember part of the fun of finding boxes is <br/>
"getting in the head" of the planter while you are <br/>
searching.  Everyone is going to see and describe something different <br/>
than you may see or describe it.  If you aren't open minded about the <br/>
clues and try to see things you wouldn't normally see, it's easy to <br/>
get confused and not find the box.  Also, lots of clues will be <br/>
intentionally vague and misleading to cause you some extra <br/>
challenge.  The thrill of the hunt involves figuring it all <br/>
out!  Anyway, the box clues I'm looking at, that I think is the one <br/>
you were trying to find, was just found 5 days ago.... so it should <br/>
still be there!<br/>
<br/>
I think it just may be that the bad guys just happened to be there <br/>
when you were, saw an opportunity and took it, randomly.  Was your <br/>
purse visibly out in the open in the car?  Did you hide it in the <br/>
trunk or under the seat in such a way that someone could have seen <br/>
you hiding it?  There's a great set of articles on atlasquest about <br/>
being safe and practicing safe habits while <br/>
letterboxing.  http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/rules/  Check it out!<br/>
<br/>
Give it another shot.  Like I said, I'm sure this was just a random <br/>
event that had nothing to do with the box itself.  Get out there and <br/>
box, again.  Maybe go somewhere where you are more familiar.  Bring a <br/>
friend.  Be aware of where you are and who else is there.  Trust your <br/>
gut, if you get a bad vibe out of the situation or someone hanging <br/>
around... get back in your car and leave.<br/>

Incidentally, right now I'm watching on the news about an attack up at Camp<br/>

evening...........not a good time to go boxing in Cook County forest<br/>

I won't repeat too much of what everyone else has already said, but I <br/>
too agree you were most likely not set up at all.  In fact, I feel much <br/>
more comfortable hunting boxes in the setting that you chose. <br/>
<br/>
The one thing I will add is that I recently had my letterboxing bag by <br/>
Eagle Creek stolen because someone thought it was probably a purse of <br/>
some sort---but instead they got my treasured signature stamp, my <br/>
logbook, all my Marvy Markers, stamp pads, my AAA card and some <br/>
emergency money?!  That was the draw that got them into my car and it <br/>
never occured to me that someone would steal my hiking bag?!  I know I <br/>
left it right on the passenger seat after having a great day of hunting.  :(<br/>
<br/>
Please, please do not give up on letterboxing.  It is such a rewarding <br/>
hobby that never fails to give you some joy often from unexpected <br/>
places---whether it is a wonderful location, a creative stamp, a <br/>
handmade logbook matching the theme, a stamp that makes you smile <br/>
because the name of the box itself now makes more sense or meeting a <br/>
fellow letterboxer on the trail!  If you begin to place your own boxes, <br/>
it is also some of the most awesome emails sent when someone else finds <br/>
their first box--which just happens to be yours. <br/>
<br/>
We all hope you give it another try and hope that you are able to get <br/>
your car fixed and driver's license and other personal items squared <br/>
away quickly!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just want to add that the officer that came to the<br/>
scene told us that this has been going on regularly in<br/>
the south and southwest side forest preserves.<br/>
<br/>
He related an incident where a woman actually locked<br/>
her purse in her trunk BEFORE even leaving her<br/>
driveway at home, as she was on her way to a forest<br/>
preserve.  <br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, her trunk was jimmied and purse was<br/>
stolen in the parking lot of the preserve.  <br/>
<br/>
The officer said that the people who are doing this<br/>
will simply randomly choose an auto, whether or not<br/>
any valuables are showing, and break in to search. <br/>
Even car trunks, where obviously there is nothing<br/>
visible.<br/>
<br/>
So, basically you can take everything out of your car<br/>
and carry it on your person and your car still stands<br/>
a chance of being damaged and broken into.<br/>
<br/>
Just want to spread this warning to those in northern<br/>
Illinois.<br/>
<br/>
Had I been forewarned of this type of crime being so<br/>
widespread in my area I would not have gone to the<br/>
forest preserve, no way.<br/>
<br/>
And, unfortunately, it does put a sour taste in my<br/>
mouth toward letterboxing.  It just isn't as exciting<br/>
anymore after I have spent all day dealing with<br/>
insurance company, dmv, bank, credit card companies,<br/>
etc.<br/>

unable to determine what this meant:<br/>
<br/>
"Cross the wash and count ten steps. There you should<br/>
find yourself standing next to a fallen burnt log on<br/>
your right." <br/>
<br/>
My note:  DID NOT SEE ANY BURNT LOGS<br/>
<br/>
AND:<br/>
<br/>
"(At this point you can continue down the path to the<br/>
creek and check out the creek and the tree<br/>
bridge)BUT the clues to the letterbox call for you<br/>
to turn around, and go back on the trail you just came<br/>
50 steps from the fallen burnt log."<br/>
<br/>
My note:  This run-on sentence can be interpreted<br/>
different ways making the directions totally<br/>
different.  It can mean - 'the clues to the letterbox<br/>
call for you to turn around, and go back on the trail;<br/>
 you just came 50 steps from the fallen burnt log.'<br/>
<br/>
if this is the case, then they are simply telling you<br/>
how far you have just come from the burnt log if you<br/>
go off the trail.<br/>
<br/>
but it could also go like this:<br/>
<br/>
'the clues to the letterbox call for you to turn<br/>
around, and go back to on the trail you just came<br/>
(from) 50 steps from the fallen burnt log.<br/>
<br/>
If this is the case, then I'm going to assume that if<br/>
you go off the trail and then get back on it AT the<br/>
point of the burnt log, then you should now take 50<br/>
steps.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I meant by confusing.  I still have no<br/>
idea which the author meant.  Because we had invested<br/>
so much time already, we tried both - we canvassed the<br/>
area encompassing from between 0 to 50 steps.  There<br/>
are SO MANY trees that you could never be sure that<br/>
you were in the area between two trees 'one at 80<br/>
degrees on your left, and the other at 280 degrees on<br/>
your right.'  At any given spot on the trail you would<br/>
be in between trees at these directions!<br/>
<br/>
Depending on placement of punctuation (and the lack<br/>
thereof) a sentence can have entirely different<br/>
meanings.  And the sentence that reads:  <br/>
<br/>
"BUT the clues to the letterbox call for you to turn<br/>
around, and go back on the trail you just came 50<br/>
steps from the fallen burnt log."  is definitely<br/>
missing punctuation because it makes no sense as it<br/>
is.<br/>

&gt; Hi K,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Welcome to letterboxing!  If you think about it,<br/>
&gt; letterboxing is really no<br/>
&gt; more unsafe than any other activity you'd be doing<br/>
&gt; in whatever area forest<br/>
&gt; preserve you went to. Thank God it was your car that<br/>
&gt; was damaged and not<br/>
&gt; your or any of your family.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cook County forest preserves can present more than<br/>
&gt; the usual amount of<br/>
&gt; problems because they're both secluded, so you can<br/>
&gt; easily end up in an area<br/>
&gt; where nobody will hear you scream or, if they do,<br/>
&gt; they're not about to help<br/>
&gt; you anyway, and since Cook County is so urban and so<br/>
&gt; populated, there are<br/>
&gt; likely to be far more "weirdos" and "sickos"<br/>
&gt; abounding.  There are also a<br/>
&gt; lot of homeless people who live in forest preserves,<br/>
&gt; about 1/3 of the<br/>
&gt; homeless population are emotionally disturbed in<br/>
&gt; some form or another, and<br/>
&gt; they can become both very upset if they feel people<br/>
&gt; might be coming too<br/>
&gt; close to where they've stashed their possessions and<br/>
&gt; also can tend to break<br/>
&gt; into vehicles looking for cash or anything they can<br/>
&gt; sell quickly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you're not used to keeping an eye out for<br/>
&gt; yourself in a forest preserve<br/>
&gt; setting, you might want to try some of the DuPage<br/>
&gt; County boxes first to get<br/>
&gt; a feel for it.  Not that ANY preserve is totally<br/>
&gt; safe, tho.  I had the<br/>
&gt; scariest boxing "adventure" of my life so far out on<br/>
&gt; Johnson's Mound in Kane<br/>
&gt; County, a box planted by the now-apparently-defunct<br/>
&gt; Gray Family 5.  And I've<br/>
&gt; always felt that Kane County's preserves were pretty<br/>
&gt; darn safe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You mention "night."  I'm hoping that means you're<br/>
&gt; not boxing in the Cook<br/>
&gt; County forest preserves after dark.  Not wise.  If<br/>
&gt; you're talking, "night",<br/>
&gt; as in maybe early evening, after work and before the<br/>
&gt; sun goes down, I still<br/>
&gt; wouldn't go on a Thursday evening.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only box somewhat in your area that I definitely<br/>
&gt; would NOT attempt<br/>
&gt; unless you've got your wills updated is the one that<br/>
&gt; takes in Bachelor's<br/>
&gt; Grove Cemetery.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My own personal opinions about Cook County forest<br/>
&gt; preserves are that the<br/>
&gt; "safest" boxing has been on weekend mid-mornings and<br/>
&gt; early afternoons.<br/>
&gt; Monday thru Friday SEEM great as far as being able<br/>
&gt; to search for boxes with<br/>
&gt; oftentimes few people around to really be watching<br/>
&gt; what you're doing and<br/>
&gt; risk muggles harming the box.  But there often<br/>
&gt; aren't enough people around<br/>
&gt; to hope to help out if there IS going to be a<br/>
&gt; problem.  Thursday, Friday,<br/>
&gt; and Saturday evenings, the gangs, drug sellers,<br/>
&gt; party crowds with the<br/>
&gt; alcohol, etc. tend to come out.  I do not box in the<br/>
&gt; Cook County preserves<br/>
&gt; on those evenings.  But, in this weather, Saturday<br/>
&gt; and Sunday, the gang<br/>
&gt; folks, drug folks, etc. are often all sleeping in<br/>
&gt; from the night before,<br/>
&gt; plus the "weekend warriors" and "weekend R&amp;Rers"<br/>
&gt; come out -- people fishing,<br/>
&gt; boating, biking, jogging, taking hikes with the<br/>
&gt; kids, etc. -- so altho<br/>
&gt; discretion can be much harder, I think the safety<br/>
&gt; factor is way up. Just<br/>
&gt; have to be more careful, tho, that people don't<br/>
&gt; decide to investigate just<br/>
&gt; what it is that you're doing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone else's mileage may vary, obviously, this is<br/>
&gt; just what I've found in<br/>
&gt; the Cook County preserves.  A lot of the preserves<br/>
&gt; have beefed up police and<br/>
&gt; ranger patrols, but they're still spread pretty thin<br/>
&gt; and it's almost<br/>
&gt; impossible for them sometimes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And there are some nice boxes out there in both<br/>
&gt; DuPage and Cook Counties<br/>
&gt; which aren't in forest preserves.  You might have to<br/>
&gt; travel further to get<br/>
&gt; to them.  I don't know if any of them are in your<br/>
&gt; neck of the woods.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's highly unlikely it would be a set-up.  I think<br/>
&gt; probably even if you<br/>
&gt; weren't letterboxing, the car would have ended up<br/>
&gt; being broken into.  This<br/>
&gt; was your first letterboxing experience.  There can<br/>
&gt; be a biiiig learning<br/>
&gt; curve to letterboxing.  Clues that might seem really<br/>
&gt; vague to you now, you<br/>
&gt; might kick yourself a year down the road that you<br/>
&gt; didn't see what the clues<br/>
&gt; meant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And on the other hand, if the box was placed by<br/>
&gt; someone relatively<br/>
&gt; inexperienced, placing a letterbox has a biiiig<br/>
&gt; learning curve too.  The<br/>
&gt; more a person does it, the better they (hopefully)<br/>
&gt; will become at writing<br/>
&gt; clues.  And then some people DO intentionally write<br/>
&gt; vague clues.  I like<br/>
&gt; difficult clues.  But I heartily dislike vague<br/>
&gt; clues.  Because I don't like<br/>
&gt; to go tromping thru woods and possibly hurt fragile<br/>
&gt; environments<br/>
&gt; unnecessarily.  Sometimes when you're just starting<br/>
&gt; out boxing, it might be<br/>
&gt; better to look for a box that's been planted by<br/>
&gt; someone who seems to have<br/>
&gt; more experience.  Or maybe post before going<br/>
&gt; searching, to get opinions on<br/>
&gt; the box.  I'm not talking about "hints" or giving<br/>
&gt; away any secrets or<br/>
&gt; anything, but just to see if it might be a good box<br/>
&gt; for a newbie?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Was this box on LbNA?  The only two boxes for Orland<br/>
&gt; Park on LbNA are<br/>
&gt; Howling Coyote's "Shake! Shake! Shake!", which has<br/>
&gt; good clues and a great<br/>
&gt; stamp -- I loved that stamp! -- and Tiptoe and<br/>
&gt; Tonto's Cicada Mania, which I<br/>
&gt; had intended to go looking for this Sunday but the<br/>
&gt; clues for that one don't<br/>
&gt; really seem vague at all, tho it certainly looks<br/>
&gt; like a compass is<br/>
&gt; necessary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, if you decide to take another stab at<br/>
&gt; letterboxing once you've<br/>
&gt; recovered somewhat and want to meet up some Sunday<br/>
&gt; early to mid-morning or<br/>
&gt; so, email me privately.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My sisters, my son and I have been very excited to<br/>
&gt; get started with<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We decided to go on our first hunt last night.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We printed out clues for a letterbox near us in a<br/>
&gt; forest preserve in<br/>
&gt; Orland Park, IL.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First of all, we spent about 45 minutes searching<br/>
&gt; since the<br/>
&gt; directions became quite vague once we were in the<br/>
&gt; forest.  We gave<br/>
&gt; up, very disheartened, finding nothing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The worst part was when we returned to my car in the<br/>
&gt; parking lot.<br/>
&gt; It had been vandalized - a window had been shattered<br/>
&gt; and my purse<br/>
&gt; stolen with all my credit cards and drivers license.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had just bought this car on Tuesday.  How<br/>
&gt; devastating.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband feels that this could have been a set up.<br/>
&gt;  Get people to<br/>
&gt; go deep into the forest on a search for nothing<br/>
&gt; while they break<br/>
&gt; into your car.<br/>

<br/>
the parking lot where we parked was full of cars. <br/>
There were bikers heading off on the bike trail there.<br/>
 When we got back, there was still another car there -<br/>
a family with a child.<br/>
<br/>
What blew me away was that the child (a girl about 7)<br/>
was wandering alone in the parking lot.  We asked her<br/>
if she saw anyone break the car window.  She readily<br/>
came over and spoke with us.  She was very friendly. <br/>
Her parents were nowhere in sight.  We asked her where<br/>
her mom and dad were - she pointed to the bike trail. <br/>
Evidently, they were still walking the trail and let<br/>
her go back to the parking lot ALONE.<br/>
<br/>
She was there, hanging around with us for a good 15<br/>
minutes before the parents appeared.  <br/>
<br/>
wow.<br/>

Just because it happened one time while you were out letterboxing is <br/>

I was feeling sorry for you until you added this point. That's just<br/>
completely and utterly uncalled for. When was this box planted? You<br/>
think someone sits around for days and weeks at a time waiting for a<br/>
sole letterboxer to come along and abandon their car? What do they do<br/>
when a person who's just out for a walk in the woods but aren't<br/>
letterboxing park comes along. "Nope, can't get that car. They aren't<br/>
letterboxers!"<br/>
<br/>
It's not hard to find an unattended car at remote trailheads, which is<br/>
why they are often common targets for thieves. It happens all over the<br/>
country. I know of cars broken into here in Washington, in Oregon, and<br/>
I even posted pictures of broken glass from break-ins at a trailhead I<br/>
was at in Hawaii. It happens. Some places it might happen more often<br/>
than others, and fortunately it's still rare overall, but it happens.<br/>
Fabricating a clue and waiting for what may be days or weeks, even<br/>
months or years in some cases, is just ludicrous. I only wish all<br/>
thieves were so stupid--it would make them a lot easier to catch. <br/>

<br/>
I also don't think that it's totally inconceivable that we could find this<br/>
type of stuff happening here and there, altho in probably very very rare<br/>
situations, as the media brings the idea of letterboxing to more and more<br/>
people.  I don't about your neck of the woods, but no boxes around here have<br/>
to go for "days and weeks, even months or years" before having finders.  Not<br/>
if they're posted on LbNA or atlasquest.  Around here, it's a matter of<br/>
hours, sometimes minutes, of when the box is posted on LbNA or atlasquest<br/>
that boxers start working the clues. :-) Boxes planted in 40 below zero<br/>
weather with 3 feet of snow on the ground, yeah, those might sit a bit<br/>
waiting for nicer weather to come along.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying I think at all that it's even a remote possibility in her<br/>
situation.  Just because I know the ins and outs of a lot of the Cook County<br/>
forest preserves.  Nobody needs to go to the work of planting a box to draw<br/>
people in to be able to take advantage of them.<br/>
<br/>
Given the sheer numbers of people who visit the Cook County preserves every<br/>
day, the number of people who have crimes perpetrated on them is probably<br/>
very tiny compared to the total number of people who visit the preserves.<br/>
But someone has to be the victim, and it can easily be a letterboxer, given<br/>
that many boxers like to box at times when they don't have to worry so much<br/>
about the discretion issues, and those are the times that the crime right is<br/>
going to go up.  She said that when she left her car, there were plenty of<br/>
people around.  When she returned, there was only her car and one other.<br/>
Even tho it was still light out, it was probably just a little too late in<br/>
the day.<br/>
<br/>
The poster said this was her first letterboxing experience.  So she and her<br/>
sisters might not realize that it would be a pretty remote possibility that<br/>
an unsavory character would bother going to the work of placing a fake<br/>
letterbox just to rip off peoples' cars when they park there.  Her husband<br/>
might know even less about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
It just sounded to me that, altho she said she's from that area and that was<br/>
why she chose to go searching for that particular box, she's not all that<br/>
familiar with the ins and outs of Cook County forest preserves and the<br/>
potential they present for unsavory characters to be able to take advantage<br/>
of people.<br/>
<br/>
And that's a good lesson for other folks new to boxing to take heed of.<br/>
Preserves are not necessarily safe places.  Just because ya pass them all<br/>
the time and see folks out hikin' and bikin' and having huge family picnics<br/>
and such, and they look like fun places to be, there's also a dark side to<br/>
them, some dark sides being vandalism to cars or the robbing of people, to<br/>
getting caught in the middle of a gang fight if two rival gangs decide to<br/>
claim that woods as their own (also something that tends to happen around<br/>
sundown when most people have already cleared out for the day), to being<br/>
murdered and having your body stashed away there in the woods (to maybe be<br/>
found a year or two down the road).<br/>
<br/>
It always worries me when I read about single parents who go boxing with no<br/>
other adults, taking young children boxing with them.  If they're confronted<br/>
by an unsavory character, having that child there to have to protect and<br/>
worry about can really make the situation worse.  Bending into a car for an<br/>
extended period of time getting a child in or out of a car seat and not<br/>
paying any attention to what might be going on around them outside the car<br/>
also makes the adult more vulnerable if someone wants to sneak up suddenly<br/>
from behind them.<br/>
<br/>
I think her post was a good one to get new boxers, especially those for whom<br/>
letterboxing might be their first experience of being in more remote areas<br/>
with fewer people around, to think about safety.  Safety first, letterboxing<br/>
second.  No, I don't follow my own advice.  :-)  But I've got an absolutely<br/>
fantastic sixth sense, and I take MOST of the safety precautions I can think<br/>
of.  But I do box alone 99.97% of the time and I do often box at very<br/>
offbeat hours.   One of these days, it could get me killed tho.  And I'll<br/>
have nobody to blame but myself.  But it'll be OK...........because I will<br/>
have found that box YES!!!!!!!!!!!  :-)<br/>

&gt; type of stuff happening here and there, altho in<br/>
&gt; probably very very rare<br/>
&gt; situations, as the media brings the idea of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing to more and more<br/>
&gt; people.  I don't about your neck of the woods, but<br/>
&gt; no boxes around here have<br/>
&gt; to go for "days and weeks, even months or years"<br/>
&gt; before having finders.  Not<br/>
&gt; if they're posted on LbNA or atlasquest.  Around<br/>
&gt; here, it's a matter of<br/>
&gt; hours, sometimes minutes, of when the box is posted<br/>
&gt; on LbNA or atlasquest<br/>
&gt; that boxers start working the clues. :-) Boxes<br/>
&gt; planted in 40 below zero<br/>
&gt; weather with 3 feet of snow on the ground, yeah,<br/>
&gt; those might sit a bit<br/>
&gt; waiting for nicer weather to come along.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not saying I think at all that it's even a<br/>
&gt; remote possibility in her<br/>
&gt; situation.  Just because I know the ins and outs of<br/>
&gt; a lot of the Cook County<br/>
&gt; forest preserves.  Nobody needs to go to the work of<br/>
&gt; planting a box to draw<br/>
&gt; people in to be able to take advantage of them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Given the sheer numbers of people who visit the Cook<br/>
&gt; County preserves every<br/>
&gt; day, the number of people who have crimes<br/>
&gt; perpetrated on them is probably<br/>
&gt; very tiny compared to the total number of people who<br/>
&gt; visit the preserves.<br/>
&gt; But someone has to be the victim, and it can easily<br/>
&gt; be a letterboxer, given<br/>
&gt; that many boxers like to box at times when they<br/>
&gt; don't have to worry so much<br/>
&gt; about the discretion issues, and those are the times<br/>
&gt; that the crime right is<br/>
&gt; going to go up.  She said that when she left her<br/>
&gt; car, there were plenty of<br/>
&gt; people around.  When she returned, there was only<br/>
&gt; her car and one other.<br/>
&gt; Even tho it was still light out, it was probably<br/>
&gt; just a little too late in<br/>
&gt; the day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The poster said this was her first letterboxing<br/>
&gt; experience.  So she and her<br/>
&gt; sisters might not realize that it would be a pretty<br/>
&gt; remote possibility that<br/>
&gt; an unsavory character would bother going to the work<br/>
&gt; of placing a fake<br/>
&gt; letterbox just to rip off peoples' cars when they<br/>
&gt; park there.  Her husband<br/>
&gt; might know even less about letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It just sounded to me that, altho she said she's<br/>
&gt; from that area and that was<br/>
&gt; why she chose to go searching for that particular<br/>
&gt; box, she's not all that<br/>
&gt; familiar with the ins and outs of Cook County forest<br/>
&gt; preserves and the<br/>
&gt; potential they present for unsavory characters to be<br/>
&gt; able to take advantage<br/>
&gt; of people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And that's a good lesson for other folks new to<br/>
&gt; boxing to take heed of.<br/>
&gt; Preserves are not necessarily safe places.  Just<br/>
&gt; because ya pass them all<br/>
&gt; the time and see folks out hikin' and bikin' and<br/>
&gt; having huge family picnics<br/>
&gt; and such, and they look like fun places to be,<br/>
&gt; there's also a dark side to<br/>
&gt; them, some dark sides being vandalism to cars or the<br/>
&gt; robbing of people, to<br/>
&gt; getting caught in the middle of a gang fight if two<br/>
&gt; rival gangs decide to<br/>
&gt; claim that woods as their own (also something that<br/>
&gt; tends to happen around<br/>
&gt; sundown when most people have already cleared out<br/>
&gt; for the day), to being<br/>
&gt; murdered and having your body stashed away there in<br/>
&gt; the woods (to maybe be<br/>
&gt; found a year or two down the road).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It always worries me when I read about single<br/>
&gt; parents who go boxing with no<br/>
&gt; other adults, taking young children boxing with<br/>
&gt; them.  If they're confronted<br/>
&gt; by an unsavory character, having that child there to<br/>
&gt; have to protect and<br/>
&gt; worry about can really make the situation worse. <br/>
&gt; Bending into a car for an<br/>
&gt; extended period of time getting a child in or out of<br/>
&gt; a car seat and not<br/>
&gt; paying any attention to what might be going on<br/>
&gt; around them outside the car<br/>
&gt; also makes the adult more vulnerable if someone<br/>
&gt; wants to sneak up suddenly<br/>
&gt; from behind them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think her post was a good one to get new boxers,<br/>
&gt; especially those for whom<br/>
&gt; letterboxing might be their first experience of<br/>
&gt; being in more remote areas<br/>
&gt; with fewer people around, to think about safety. <br/>
&gt; Safety first, letterboxing<br/>
&gt; second.  No, I don't follow my own advice.  :-)  But<br/>
&gt; I've got an absolutely<br/>
&gt; fantastic sixth sense, and I take MOST of the safety<br/>
&gt; precautions I can think<br/>
&gt; of.  But I do box alone 99.97% of the time and I do<br/>
&gt; often box at very<br/>
&gt; offbeat hours.   One of these days, it could get me<br/>
&gt; killed tho.  And I'll<br/>
&gt; have nobody to blame but myself.  But it'll be<br/>
&gt; OK...........because I will<br/>
&gt; have found that box YES!!!!!!!!!!!  :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; My husband feels that this could have been a set<br/>
&gt; up.  Get people to<br/>
&gt; &gt; go deep into the forest on a search for nothing<br/>
&gt; while they break<br/>
&gt; &gt; into your car.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was feeling sorry for you until you added this<br/>
&gt; point. That's just<br/>
&gt; completely and utterly uncalled for. When was this<br/>
&gt; box planted? You<br/>
&gt; think someone sits around for days and weeks at a<br/>
&gt; time waiting for a<br/>
&gt; sole letterboxer to come along and abandon their<br/>
&gt; car? What do they do<br/>
&gt; when a person who's just out for a walk in the woods<br/>
&gt; but aren't<br/>
&gt; letterboxing park comes along. "Nope, can't get that<br/>
&gt; car. They aren't<br/>
&gt; letterboxers!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's not hard to find an unattended car at remote<br/>
&gt; trailheads, which is<br/>
&gt; why they are often common targets for thieves. It<br/>
&gt; happens all over the<br/>
&gt; country. I know of cars broken into here in<br/>
&gt; Washington, in Oregon, and<br/>
&gt; I even posted pictures of broken glass from<br/>
&gt; break-ins at a trailhead I<br/>
&gt; was at in Hawaii. It happens. Some places it might<br/>
&gt; happen more often<br/>
&gt; than others, and fortunately it's still rare<br/>
&gt; overall, but it happens.<br/>
&gt; Fabricating a clue and waiting for what may be days<br/>
&gt; or weeks, even<br/>
&gt; months or years in some cases, is just ludicrous. I<br/>
&gt; only wish all<br/>
&gt; thieves were so stupid--it would make them a lot<br/>
&gt; easier to catch.<br/>

This list goes up in flames frequently, I don't recommend it for<br/>
anyone with a thin skin. Of all the lists I belong to I have never<br/>
seen a list get as nasty as this one. Ryan's comment was mild compared<br/>
to the average flame here:)<br/>
I do recommend the Yahoo group for new boxers. I can't remember the<br/>
exact name right now but if you do a search on (letterboxing, new),<br/>
you should be able to find it. They are quite kind.<br/>
I haven't had my car broken into but I have wondered why not. I think<br/>
that it happens more and more these days to hikers and boxers alike<br/>
and it is quite sad.<br/>
<br/>
I have sometimes thought that I should go back to an old car and just<br/>
leave it unlocked. That way it is obvious that there is nothing to<br/>
steal because even if you left your purse at home, thieves don't know<br/>
that and a broken car is a drag too.<br/>
There are some great boxes in urban settings if you don't want to<br/>
venture the woods anytime soon, although I don't know about Illinois.<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<br/>
Even the Code of Conduct on Atlas Quest says: <br/>
<br/>
"Do not forget security from the two-legged variety of animals (i.e.<br/>
people). Deep in the woods and away from civilization is not a<br/>
breeding ground of killers, rapists, and thieves. The stories you hear<br/>
on the news are news because such events are so unusualyou are far<br/>
more likely to be attacked walking down a public street than you will<br/>
be on a little used trail far from civilization.<br/>
<br/>
More likely, evil doers are lurking near the trailhead where they can<br/>
smash into your car and steal any valuables left behinda fate that<br/>
has struck many letterboxers. Leave nothing of value in your car,<br/>
orat the very leasthide everything of value under your car seat, in<br/>
your trunk, or somewhere else hidden from view."<br/>

Letterboxers are a wonderful bunch of people. It doesn't do anyone<br/>
well to paint them in an unfair light. Sorry for the hurt feelings.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">K, I'm sorry to hear about your bad experience.  I go letterboxing with my mom and dad, with NOW 6 kids in tow.  They all love letterboxing.  This morning, my momand dad,  and 4 out of the 6 brats (form our Trail name) , and went to the one you had the bad experience at in Orland.  I didn't know they went to the same one until they called me and told me they found the box, and where it was.  My family found the box you were searching for, but it is one of them that you need a compass for.  They went to the wrong tree at first, but then pulled out the compass and found it.  And it never fails, we're always right begind Atom118 and Coffee Beans in finding the boxes.  LOL  Luckily, (knock on wood) we haven't had any real bad luck in letterboxing. Not finding one or two, is normal, especially in the beginning.  My parents actually got caught in the bad thunderstorm last year on the REAL long LB hike, and when they started to head back for the car, large tree branches were<br/>
 fallen on the path, and they were SOAKED by the time they got to the car!   But, usually, if they go out without me, thye call me and let me know where they are at, and call back to let me know if they found the box or not.  My parents do that whether they have my kids or not with them.  We were lucky enough to run into a couple letterboxers on our 1st try out, and they were wonderful.  (the Wormy Wanderers)   If you ever wanna try again, we live in Alsip, send me a line, and if we're going out for the day, we would be happy to show you it can be fun.  (if you don't mind a trail of 6 kids with!)  =)  The next few weeks, we got a B-day (Swee' Pea will be 2yrs) and also a wedding the following week, so in June, after the 1st week, we'll be starting to hit the trails at least one day onn the weekend.  There are some wonderful letterboxes out there, and some that lead to a great ice cream shop, or a place to eat or shop!   We planted our 1st one last year, in Wisconsin, and so<br/>
 far everyone likes it!  We plan on planting some more this year as well.  And unfortunately, another one in Wisconsin..Sorry, Illinois, we will be planting some here as well!!!  (The next one in Wisconsin is a special one....it's for my cousins)  =)   Well, I hope you will give it a try again!  Usually best time to go is early on the weekends, about 8am and well go LBing until 4pm.  We pack a lunch and eat at one of the parks before heading to the next stop, and we clean our hands well afterwards to get rid of any food scent so we don't attract animals to the box.  Well take care, and hope to see you out on the trails.<br/>

Sorry, but it felt like an indictment of letterboxers everywhere, and<br/>
being a letterboxer myself, I probably took it a bit too personally.<br/>
Not all letterboxers are going to be thoughtful, wonderful people, but<br/>
something as ludicrous as thinking someone deliberately planting a<br/>
box just to break into someone's car.... At least if you (or your<br/>
husband, really) wants to accuse letterboxers of something, throw out<br/>
mud that will stick. =)<br/>
