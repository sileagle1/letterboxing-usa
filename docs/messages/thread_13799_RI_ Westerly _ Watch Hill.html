                    <div class="plaintext-content">We decided to take Madras to the beach last night for her little <br/>
birthday excursion. Had a lovely walk down the beach at Watch Hill <br/>
and to Napatree Point. Maddie had great fun chasing the piping <br/>
plovers... which taste like chicken!  (KIDDING) <br/>
<br/>
Once we got to the end we tried to follow the clues to the Napatree <br/>
Point letterbox.... not a good idea considering i had a pair of flip-<br/>
flops that would NOT have saved me from the "grove" of poison ivy and <br/>
wild beach roses that left a path just big enough for a gnat to <br/>
meander through!   <br/>
<br/>
We explored other trails on the way back but could see no way to get <br/>
to where we were supposed to be. Oh well, disappointed we could not <br/>
reach it, but what a great time!!!!   Watch Hill is a special place <br/>
for us because we had some wedding pictures taken with that huge <br/>
yellow house and the light house as a backdrop!  Actually, the <br/>
lighthouse is hanging in the living room right now : )<br/>
<br/>
It got late and we were a bit tired, so we skipped the Lighthouse <br/>
box. It was a bit late to hit Wilcox park too and from what I <br/>
understand there was some big show there last night too...<br/>
<br/>
I did get the Fish Tales box in East Lyme this morning on the way <br/>
home from work : )   another fine carving!<br/>

Sorry, I should have been more clear.  I meant the Wilcox Park box.  <br/>
That one is missing.  Wooden Horse Carousel (the box at Napatree <br/>
Point) should still be there amongst the poison ivy.<br/>
