<div>Hello all~</div>
<div>Took our first ever excursion to the letterbox on the middle fork 
river.  Awesome hike and great fun for 2 mom's with kids!  The only 
real disappointment was we never could find the letterbox!!!  (Does anyone 
have any idea of how many "grey rocks" there are by a river?)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wondering if anybody out there knows if the box is still there?  My 
oldest was quite disappointed that we didn't find out "hidden treasure".  
Letterboxes in Idaho are few and far between and we were so excited there was 
one within a couple hours drive of us.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm thinking if we ever FIND one... we could learn how to plant them and 
get a few more in our state!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for any ideas if the box is still there.... We looked and looked... 
despite it being rattlesnake season... </div>

<div> Hello Hare ,sorry you weren't successful .I 
contacted my son who had planted the box 7/1/01 he might be able to give 
you clearer hints if you are going back to the confluence .You can contact me 
off the list if you wish at <a href="mailto:foxsecurity@earthlink.net">foxsecurity@earthlink.net</a> .My 
guess is that you probably are the first to go for this box as it is in an area 
not frequented by many boxers . While there may be many grey rocks around a 
river there are not that many " large gray rocks on a quartz slab 2-3 ft 
west / northwest from a large pine tree above the confluence
