                    <div class="plaintext-content">my brother, who now boxes, lives in shreveport LA. while i was down there, i visited little rock, AK, houston, TX, and vicksburg, MS. with out letterboxing, i probably wouldn't have gone to any of those places. i have been to portland, ME many times, but never the places that letterboxing has taken me in portland. even in my home state of NH, i continue to visit places i never knew exsisted.<br/>
<br/>
  i couldn't agree more with the walk. when i first started letterboxing last year, i was hooked on the boxing aspect of the trip and forgot about the nature part. now i combine them both. i bring a camera everytime i box and always come home with some beautiful pictures. Ahhh! smell the fresh air. wait, wait, step away from the computer and go outside first. then smell the fresh air. Ahhh!<br/>
