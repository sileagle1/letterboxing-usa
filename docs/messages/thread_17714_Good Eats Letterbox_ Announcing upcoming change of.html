<br/>
It's been just over three months since the Good Eats Letterbox was <br/>
placed with its first stamp featuring Seafood and it's time for a <br/>
new feature cuisine.  For those that didn't see the original <br/>
announcement for this box, here's a recap:<br/>
<br/>
The Good Eats Letterbox is a cuisine-oriented letterbox. Every few <br/>
months the letterbox will feature a new cuisine and a new stamp for <br/>
that cuisine. In addition to the normal stamp-in procedure, fellow <br/>
letterboxers are requested to enter into the logbook one or more of <br/>
their favorite restaurants that serve the featured cuisine. Of <br/>
course people stamping in will want to jot down the selected <br/>
recommendations into their own logbook as well. Recommendations may <br/>
be for local or distant places.   See the clue page for further <br/>
details: (http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?<br/>
boxnum=6197&amp;boxname=Good%20Eats)<br/>
<br/>
To date the box has been well visited for its young age and has <br/>
become a popular spot for hitchikers; I think the changing nature of <br/>
this box with its frequent visitors makes it well suited for <br/>
hitchhikers and will help to "keep `em moving".  We've enjoyed <br/>
visiting and "discovering" the restaurants that people have <br/>
recommended, definitely we're finding Good Eats at each one we visit.<br/>
<br/>
The original seafood stamp that I created for this box proved to be <br/>
too large for some log books so I carved a second, smaller, stamp. <br/>
Both are currently in this box, which brings me to the point of this <br/>
posting.  <br/>
<br/>
I've carved the stamp for the next feature cuisine which is: <br/>
Mexican. I'm planning to change the stamp on the evening of Saturday <br/>
Feb. 28 so that folks that may be in the area for the Peace on Earth <br/>
gathering on Feb. 29 in Westborough will have an opportunity to get <br/>
the stamps for both cuisines if they so desire.  Westborough is <br/>
about a half hour drive from Good Eats in Acton.<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to seeing folks at Peace on Earth.  Happy <br/>
travels and Good Eats!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
