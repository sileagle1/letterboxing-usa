by Salamander. Difficulty: Easy.  This letterbox is located on the <br/>
campus of Ohio University in Chillicothe.  CLUES: Go to OU-C and <br/>
locate a tall flagpole flying the American and Ohio flags.  Standing <br/>
to the north of the flagpole, take a compass reading of 307 degrees. <br/>
Head in that direction until you come to a vehicle service entrance <br/>
which heads into the lower level of the building.  The top of both <br/>
sides of this sloping entryway is protected by black railing. You are <br/>
interested in the westernmost railing. Count the 1/2 inch diameter <br/>
vertical posts in the rail. The box is under the shrubbery opposite <br/>
the 3rd post. Note: this is a busy area so you may have to work a <br/>
little at being "sneaky" -- I kept acting like I was waiting for <br/>
someone until I got a chance to hide the box! <br/>
