Zug-wa Monster Letterbox Clues:  <br/>
<br/>
Zug-wa is the terrible monster that lives beneath the water in what <br/>
is now Hewitt Lake (about a mile East of the park and not open to <br/>
the public possibly for monstrous reasons?).  Nisqually tribal <br/>
legend has it that old people would not dare swim or take their <br/>
canoes onto the lake for fear they might be dragged beneath the <br/>
surface and never seen again.  Your mission is to locate Zug-wa and <br/>
to stop him from continuing his terrible ways!!!<br/>
<br/>
Start by the playgroundbut you don't have time to play.  You must <br/>
find Zug-wa quickly!  Continue to the other side of the parking area <br/>
and find the gravel trail that begins with a boulder in the center.<br/>
<br/>
Legend has it that one day a young man and woman who were about to <br/>
marry went to look for the nest of a loon by the lake.  The man was <br/>
strong and handsome.  The woman was the daughter of a powerful local <br/>
Indian chief.  To find the nest and eggs of a loon would bring them <br/>
good luck.  <br/>
<br/>
Take the center trail for awhile as you look for the nest and eggs <br/>
of a loon.  Maybe it'll bring you some good luck!  When a narrower <br/>
trail on the left merges with the main trail, seek out an odd water <br/>
pipe fountain, perhaps the nest is nearby.  From the 4' green-capped <br/>
pipe, look for 2 little firs at approximately 140do you think the <br/>
nest is near them?  Take the trail between them to find out.  <br/>
Carefully negotiate the trail(s) heading 190 to the banks of the <br/>
river.  You'll eventually find yourself on a rocky beach along the <br/>
graceful bend of the Deschutes River.  Perhaps the loon's nest is <br/>
near the beach?  If you're lucky and it's salmon season, look for <br/>
all the furious activity of the salmon as they swim upstream to <br/>
spawn in the area.   BUT DON'T DARE VENTURE INTO THE WATER!  <br/>
<br/>
For that is what the fair woman did.  She ventured out alone to a <br/>
floating island covered in reeds, looking for the nest.  Suddenly, <br/>
she slipped beneath the water and never surfaced again. <br/>
<br/>
AND DEFINITELY DO NOT DIVE IN!  For that is what the man didhe <br/>
quickly dived in to search for her, and he, too, was lost from <br/>
sight.  <br/>
<br/>
RATHER, continue walking along the river's beach and look for 2 old <br/>
fallen trees on the beach.  Perhaps these are all that remain of our <br/>
young man and woman.  Wind your way past these logs and find a sandy <br/>
trail at 300 that winds up the slope that brings you back to the <br/>
gravel path. <br/>
<br/>
You never found the nest, did you?  Don't worry, our couple didn't <br/>
find the nest of the loons, either.  Legend has it that after <br/>
slipping under the water, the man's and the woman's bodies were <br/>
found below Tumwater Falls (a few miles North of here).  They were <br/>
drawn all the way from the lake through a mysterious underground <br/>
passage.  Even now, if you listen, sometimes you can hear their <br/>
cries in the thundering waterfall at Tumwater Falls.  Zug-wa was <br/>
apparently responsible for this sad and most tragic event and many <br/>
other similar events throughout history.  You must find Zug-wa and <br/>
stop him from continuing his terrible ways. <br/>
<br/>
At the gravel path, bear right.  Then take the next left gravel <br/>
path.  Look for a towering maple, that protects a younger fir, <br/>
eventually on your left in the tree-line behind the brambles and <br/>
tall grass.  Find the next narrow trail into the tree lineavoiding <br/>
the geocache in the area (although this might be the lost loon's <br/>
nest you're looking for) that is housed within the very large burnt <br/>
stump of an old growth fir.  <br/>
<br/>
BETTER to continue on quickly to find Zug-wa and stop him from his <br/>
terrible ways.  From the large burnt stump, head 200 toward another <br/>
cluster of maples (the one you saw from the trail) that protects the <br/>
younger fir and an old growth fir stump.  Look up atop and within <br/>
the stump for the long lost terrible Zug-wa monster of Hewitt Lake.  <br/>
Stamp him and log him and convince him to stop his terrible ways!!!<br/>

told by Del McBride, former curator of the Washington State Capital <br/>
Museum in Olympia and listed on <br/>
http://www.ci.tumwater.wa.us/ResearchCenter/Indians-page%202.htm   <br/>
Del was born at Nisqually, WA and spent most of his life in this <br/>
area.  His mother descended from the pioneer McAllister and Mounts <br/>
families, with some Cowlitz/Quinault Indian ancestry.  <br/>
