Went to the solution park but the 3 clues (found in the Suspect/Room/Weapon boxes) did not result in a box.  They were good clues and I'm 99.9% sure I was in the correct spot.<br/>
<br/>
However, I am assuming that box would not have held 3 stamps (who, where, what) and that instead it would have held another clue for the next box and etc to the final box.<br/>
<br/>
Q: Did anyone find the solution boxes after Bobafoot did maintenance in 2005?  Do you have those clues?  Let me know offline.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to have new stamps carved if the older ones are still out there somewhere AND can be found!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
