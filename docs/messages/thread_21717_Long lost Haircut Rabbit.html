    I am dancing like Snoopy upon reading this update. Just when I <br/>
feel there's no use in sending out a HH ('cause they all seem to <br/>
disappear) one of Princess Turtle's crawls out of the woodwork. Not <br/>
surprised to see it has landed in CA. The real surprise it landed in <br/>
a Lizard Patch.<br/>
    I'll have to add that to my L(reptile) count.<br/>
    Yippee and thanks, <br/>
    Psychomom &amp; Princess Turtle<br/>

   P43  F gave up counting  -F4(searched but couldn't find) X138  PB6<br/>
   E10(events)  C2(confiscated) D3(destroyed) R2(rescues) SS1(space <br/>
shuttle) and last but not least is the ever lovin' L at 24.<br/>
