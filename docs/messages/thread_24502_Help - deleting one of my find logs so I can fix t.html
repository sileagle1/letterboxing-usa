                    <div class="plaintext-content">You can change the date of your find without removing the find. Look at the title in a list <br/>
of boxes that you have found. On the right, click on the green flag. You'll see that the date <br/>
blank is blank. Just put the correct date in that blank, and your find will update to the <br/>
correct one.<br/>
<br/>
To completely remove a find, I'd contact the webmasters.  That can probably be done from <br/>
their end. Just give them all of the details.<br/>
