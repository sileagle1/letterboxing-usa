Colorbox pigment pads stay a little bit wetter than dye ink pads and so
does the impression you make when you stamp using them.  It'll take
a bit longer to dry, but it's more resistant to fading (more archival)
and it doesn't smear if the page gets wet.

There was just a big debate over the leaving of Ink-Pads in your <br/>
letterboxes.  Make sure you ziplock everything and it should be <br/>
great.  It is always nice to find a box with a different color than <br/>
you are carrying around.<br/>
And someone made the point that your individual artwork may cry out <br/>
for a certain color!  So you can provide that color to the masses!<br/>
(for example, a stamp of a rainbow would look pretty boring without a <br/>
rainbow colored ink-pad<br/>

I am at the stage of just having read about it and<br/>
have been reading messages, etc.  I have also popped<br/>
all over two of the letterboxing websites.  I live in<br/>
Western Maine, so when I start the journey to search,<br/>
I have far to go to find any.  There are great spots<br/>
to hide them, though.  Anyway, I need to gather<br/>
supplies and create my stamps.  It sounds like you a<br/>
several paces ahead of me, in terms of this hobby.  I<br/>
am just beginning....can you offer any suggestions<br/>
that the websites don't explain?  I have a better<br/>
feeling "talking" with a person than printing out all<br/>
kinds of things off a website.  I am sorry that I<br/>
can't offer you any assistance with your concern at<br/>
this point.  I hope that I can help others get started<br/>
after I become familiar with this.  It sounds like<br/>
such fun!  Thanks, Linda<br/>

My personal stamp is self-inking (red), and I've been transferring ink from <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I came across this summer's old post on stamp pads.  Several of you <br/>
know that I am a bit of a penny pincher.  I did come up with a way of <br/>
making a stamp pad for a few cents which can be added to a <br/>
letterbox.  (deja vu here?? did I already write this idea to the <br/>
group?)<br/>
<br/>
First I come up with a little plastic jar or container.  I have found <br/>
a source of inch by inch by 2 inch clear plastic containers in a <br/>
local store for 50 cents.  Other suitable containers might be small <br/>
pill or medicine jars, well cleaned out.<br/>
<br/>
Next I cut a bit of balsa wood to fit in the container... This is a <br/>
scrap from the same balsa I use as a mount for my stamps.<br/>
<br/>
To this I glue a piece of open cell foam rubber about half the size <br/>
of the wood and between a quarter and an eighth of an inch thick.  I <br/>
glue it on with superglue.  <br/>
<br/>
This is inked with a pigment stamp pad reinking bottle.  Voilla, a <br/>
couple dozen stamp pads from a bottle of reinker.  <br/>

How interesting... I would think it would be the other way around.  But<br/>
that is good to know.  <br/>

Subject: [LbNA] RE:Stamp pads<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am a stamper besides a letterboxer and have stamped for 4 years now.<br/>
In<br/>
the midst of a conversation with my stamper demostrater last year she<br/>
finally tells me that I needed to have stored my stamp pads upside down.<br/>
This helps keep the ink at the top of the pad and they will last longer.<br/>
Hope this helps.  Willow.  <br/>
