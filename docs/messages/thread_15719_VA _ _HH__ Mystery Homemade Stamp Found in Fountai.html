                    <div class="plaintext-content">    But it wasn't in a letterbox. The stamp was found in Ghosts of Occaquan<br/>
#2 Geocache that is about 50 feet away from the Creature of Fountainhead<br/>
Park #5 (Shaggy) Letterbox. The stamp design is a circle divided in half by<br/>
a curved line with the letter "T" in each half of the circle. The stamp<br/>
seems well used and has a couple of chips in the design, especially the<br/>
letters.<br/>
<br/>
Scenario #1 - Likely and the best case - A letterboxer finds the cache and<br/>
trades an old surplus stamp for a geo toy. Cool! I own someone's old stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Scernario #2 - A long shot that I would like disproved - A letterboxer<br/>
failed to find the actual letterbox and confused the geocache for the<br/>
letterbox, perhaps thinking it was a hybrid box. Said confused letterboxer<br/>
leaves a hitchhiker in the geocache. Someone trades out the hitchhiker log<br/>
but leaves the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
    Ok, #2 is a bit far-fetched. But there are plenty of missing hitchhikers<br/>
out there. If the stamp is part of a missing hitchhiker, please let me know.<br/>
Otherwise, look for a letterbox called Chip T's (rated <g for="" grin="">), coming<br/>
to a park near you next spring.<br/>
<br/>
    The SitRep for the Creature of Fountainhead series. #2, #3, and #5 are<br/>
in good shape. #4 was still damp in the box, but the materials were very<br/>
well protected in the ziplocs. I missed a turn for #1 and didn't bother to<br/>
go back for it. Ghosts #2 (no GPS needed) was also in good condition with a<br/>
geo toy collection that was slightly above average, but nothing that would<br/>
impress the geo-bashers on this list.<br/>
<br/>
    With the cartoon theme in the stamps plus a toy collection near the last<br/>
letterbox, this might be a great series for a newer letterboxing family with<br/>
young kids to use to move up from drive-by boxes to a moderate hike. This<br/>
was a great job by the Knight.<br/>

<br/>
Your first guess (scenario #1) is actually right on the money.  The stamp you <br/>
found was left by my friend Scott in exchange for some random geo trinket.  <br/>
He had carved a new stamp for himself and decided to get rid of the old one.  <br/>
He still uses the same design for his signature stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that answers your question!<br/>
