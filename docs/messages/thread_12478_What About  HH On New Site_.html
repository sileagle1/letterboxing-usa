&gt; All right.  <br/>
&gt; I'll add the old Mexico et al countries, and I'll toss <br/>
an 'international'<br/>
&gt; section into the database.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; That is, unless someone is vehemently against this.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Not sure if you want to exclude International boxes, but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rest should be included.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My vote is to include International boxes too, despite the website <br/>
nominally<br/>
&gt; being for "North American" Letterboxes (or is that North American<br/>
&gt; Letterboxe*r*s?). As far as I can tell, the lbna website is the #1 <br/>
site for<br/>
&gt; internet-based letterboxing (i.e., where clues are put on the net). <br/>
Witness<br/>
&gt; that the "global letterboxing" website has disappeared and the <br/>
global<br/>
&gt; letterboxing yahoo group has not had any message traffic since <br/>
December 02.<br/>
&gt; I don't think this is due to lack of interest in international <br/>
boxes, just<br/>
&gt; that there isn't enough of them to warrant a separate development <br/>
yet<br/>
&gt; (though I'm working on it!! :-).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm more than happy to volunteer my time to help set up and <br/>
maintain an<br/>
&gt; international section.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
