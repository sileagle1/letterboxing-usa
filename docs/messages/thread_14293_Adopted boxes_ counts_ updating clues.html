   If you happen to "adopt" a box during this transition period (see <br/>
all the abandoned box posts if you need to get brought up to <br/>
speed)...it would be nice to see the foster-parents update the clues <br/>
to have a "Adopted by:" and an "Originally Placed by:".   Though <br/>
behind this being that the original placer might come back online <br/>
someday, see the clues changed, and get mad. This way they get the <br/>
credit for having placed the box and know that there is just a <br/>
custodian taking care of their child during the "absence".  <br/>
<br/>
    Also, I'm not sure what everyone else thinks, but we personally <br/>
would NOT count an adopted box as a box placed.  Perhaps if you want <br/>
numerical recognition, add an A for adopted to you PFX (EVWYZ) <br/>
quotient!?? As always, there's no rules, it just seems to make sense..<br/>
<br/>
Again, just our $0.02 ($0.03 canadian - with conversion!) <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There was an earlier post from one of the webmasters that talked <br/>
about adding a field to the box to be able to differentiate between <br/>
the original placer and the person currently maintaining the box.  <br/>
But in the meanwhile, I added the following statement to the very top <br/>
of the clues for the boxes I have taken responsibility for:<br/>
<br/>
**This box was originally placed by [xxxxx]; I am currently <br/>
maintaining the box to prevent the clues from being dropped from the <br/>
website**<br/>
<br/>
As for the numbers...  I do not count these boxes in my numbers <br/>
anywhere, just as I do not count boxes that I put together and send <br/>
off to be a part of a series elsewhere, or boxes that other people <br/>
send to here for me to place in Michigan.  I only count boxes that I <br/>
create from beginning to end -- stamp, box, clues, etc.<br/>
