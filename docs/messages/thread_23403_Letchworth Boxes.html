<br/>
  That being said,  I did a city search anwyay on www.atlasquest.com and only 2 boxes came up for nearby there..and one of those was assumed missing.  Maybe other letterboxers feel as I do and have not have planted there for a reason.<br/>

<br/>
One has been missing for about 2 1/2 years due to trail changes and <br/>
paving on the perimeter of the park.  The other, which we were able <br/>
to find, was maliciously taken 2 years ago by someone who lived in <br/>
the area and bragged about it.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't put anything there due to the volume of <br/>
people/geocachers/destructive noxers.  It's a shame because it is <br/>
such a beautiful place!  Very middle-earthy.  Definitely worth a <br/>
visit even though there aren't any LBs.<br/>
