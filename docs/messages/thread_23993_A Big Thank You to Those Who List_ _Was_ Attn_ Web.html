Sorry - I still think if you want to play the game "your way," you <br/>
should PLAY IT "your way" and only hunt boxes that are not posted on <br/>
AQ and LBNA.  <br/>
<br/>
It's smug, self-satisfied, elitist, exclusionary attitudes that will <br/>
eventually ruin the game, not the few muggles, newbies and <br/>
inconsiderate boxers who may come along.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, with some research, I might find your clue page.  Um, do I <br/>
know who you are? Where you live? What areas you've planted in?  <br/>
Nope.  When I'm looking to travel to find boxes (as I've said, there <br/>
are very few in my area and I must go pretty far afield these days <br/>
to box) I look on the two big sites and see what I can find.  Sadly, <br/>
life sometimes gets in the way of spending too many hours on the <br/>
internet searching for clues to boxes that may or may not be in the <br/>
areas where I plan to travel.<br/>
<br/>
And I'm sure David of Team New Hampshire will miss your stamp in his <br/>
book as much as you'll miss his in yours, which is to say, not at <br/>
all.  You and what's-her-name in ME have fun playing with <br/>
yourselves, and those special few with whom you happen to share your <br/>
clues, m'kay?<br/>
<br/>
What I liked best at the two gatherings I have thus far attended? <br/>
(One of which I traveled over 900 miles to attend - yep, I'm hard-<br/>
core, baby!) The welcoming, open, friendly attitude of the folks <br/>
there!  They work hard creating new boxes and putting the info out <br/>
there for others to enjoy, and I have not yet heard the 3 most <br/>
prolific planters I have met complain about missing boxes - they <br/>
just write better clues!  <br/>
<br/>
So let me now say THANK YOU to you wonderful folks who go out there <br/>
and create those lovely boxes and put the info out there for me and <br/>
others to enjoy!  It's a selfless act in many ways, and as I <br/>
continue to work on my new series, I'm realizing how difficult it <br/>
can be to "let go" when one has spent hours carving, making logs, <br/>
finding good hidey-holes and writing creative, tricky, fun clues.  I <br/>
recently finished 3 stamps which are rather detailed and took quite <br/>
a bit of time...one may have to be re-done simply because I messed <br/>
up a bit on one side.  It would pain me, yes, if these go missing.  <br/>
But I'll have the impression in my book, and I've started taking <br/>
digital photos of my stamps, logs, and little felt stamp pouches <br/>
(what a great idea!) so that if they do disappear, I'll still have a <br/>
reminder of what went into that creation.<br/>
<br/>
Again, Thank You to all friendly, welcoming, sharing letterboxers!  <br/>
I hope you keep them coming!<br/>

<br/>
As far as what ruins the game, let's wait a hundred years and see, eh?<br/>
Letterboxing has been in the States maybe a decade or a little longer?<br/>
Dartmoor has been around an awfully looong time and it's rather<br/>
exclusionary.  The clues are in books that folks have to purchase.  And a<br/>
person technically can't purchase a book until they've found 100 boxes.  But<br/>
there are many many ways around that, the same as there are many other ways<br/>
to find boxes in the U.S. other than on LbNA or atlasquest.<br/>
<br/>
As far as traveling goes, personally, if I'm going to be traveling to an<br/>
area, I take the time to do things like join the regional list, do google<br/>
searches for boxes in those states, etc.  Oh, that's right!  You don't have<br/>
the time!  So the proper way for EVERYONE to play the game is to play the<br/>
game based on YOUR time schedule and how you prioritize YOUR time.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't mention being upset about David not finding my boxes.  So that<br/>
little bit of sarcasm will fall by the wayside.  David was the only one<br/>
throwing a temper tantrum because he felt he wasn't being given the clues to<br/>
somebody's boxes.<br/>
<br/>
So the only friendly letterboxers are the ones who attend gatherings?<br/>
Ooooooh, then I AM sooo unfriendly. Because I've never attended a gathering<br/>
and probably never will.  You prioritize by spending your time at gatherings<br/>
and not searching the internet for clues.  Think of all the research you<br/>
could have done while you were traveling 900 miles to that gathering.  I'm<br/>
just an unfriendly. smug, self-satisfied, elitist boxer with a different<br/>
priority.  I would rather search the internet in hopes of finding some of<br/>
the more obscure boxes than partying.  But somehow I get the feeling that<br/>
YOUR priorities are the PROPER priorities.  I think both priorities are<br/>
pretty reasonable for the people who hold them.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have my choice this afternoon of going and hanging my head in shame<br/>
in a corner someplace because I'm just such a smug, self-satisfied, elitist,<br/>
exclusionary unfriendly person or hittin' the road with a couple of friends<br/>
to find a few of the more obscure letterboxes we've researched and found<br/>
clues to.  I don't reckon it's hard to guess which one I'm gonna do.  :-)<br/>

  what i did is go out there, hour drive, repair the box and replant it somewhere else in the area i think it would be safer. me and other in the area have had problems. they aren't pulling thier boxes or hiding thier clues either.<br/>
<br/>
  many people plant thier boxes to bring people to new places. some just go there for the box and others take advantage of nature as i hope they do. why would i want to make that oppurtunity hard to find. thank you john and ryan for your LBNA and AQ.<br/>
<br/>
  all my clues are posted on LBNA and i'm working on posting them on AQ. your welcome to search for them whomever you are. black or white, male or female, crappy boxer or not!<br/>

  ya i'll miss his stamps, like i miss my ex-wife!<br/>

  i was "throwing my little temper tantrum" because you are quick to blame letterboxers for your boxes going missing. before you go blaming people for your boxes going missing, you must get facts. before you tell people i "threw a little temper tantrum" because i won't be able to find your boxes, look on LBNA and AQ. i'm a happy bug in a rug finding someone elses boxes. there are two sites full of people willing to share thier boxes and are open to the possibility of thier boxing going missing for whatever reason. <br/>
<br/>
  i don't "throw tantrums" over stupid stuff like clue availablity.<br/>
  what, no boxes by mosey or phyto! oh well. oh look, clues to someone elses boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  i sleep well at night!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Take a pill -- you are awfully rude.  I think that Mosey presented a good analogy about tit for tat, and yes it was taken to extreme -- to make the point.  How you think that makes a person smug or ridiculous is beyond me.  <br/>
<br/>
Just because a person chooses to keep their clues offline and use alternate means of clue distribution should not mean they cannot use online clues -- not any more than saying that a person who has not planted any letterboxes cannot look for letterboxes, which I think we all agree is a bit silly.  Why do you think it is okay to be a finder but not a planter, but yet a person must make their clues public to use public clues?  I am failing to see the difference.<br/>
<br/>
I guess if it makes it more justifiable to you -- just pretend that a person who has chosen to keep their clues offline has planted no boxes (for all intensive purposes, to you, they haven't since you make it quite clear you are not willing to hunt around a little for their clues).  There.  Now we have established that -- Offline Clue person has no plants and is now no different than the thousands of other letterboxers who go to LbNA or AQ, get clues and hunt for letterboxes without ever offering anything in return (which you seem to feel is okay).  The only difference is -- Offline Clue person *is* actually offering something in return, just that it is not being spoon-fed to you.  This is after all, letterboxing -- there are many people who feel the hunt is not just about finding the box, but also about sniffing out the clues.  Just because *you* don't want to play that way does not make it elitist or exclusionary.  That would be about as silly as saying that a person who makes difficult clues is being exclusionary because some people just aren't going to be able to figure them out.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody owes you anything, certainly not to put clues smack dab in front of your face.  Lucky for you many people do, so you should still have plenty of boxes to find without putting too much extra effort into it.<br/>

  Sorry - I still think if you want to play the game "your way," you <br/>
  should PLAY IT "your way" and only hunt boxes that are not posted on <br/>
  AQ and LBNA. <br/>
<br/>
  It's smug, self-satisfied, elitist, exclusionary attitudes that will <br/>
  eventually ruin the game, not the few muggles, newbies and <br/>
  inconsiderate boxers who may come along.<br/>
<br/>
  Oh yes, with some research, I might find your clue page. Um, do I <br/>
  know who you are? Where you live? What areas you've planted in? <br/>
  Nope. When I'm looking to travel to find boxes (as I've said, there <br/>
  are very few in my area and I must go pretty far afield these days <br/>
  to box) I look on the two big sites and see what I can find. Sadly, <br/>
  life sometimes gets in the way of spending too many hours on the <br/>
  internet searching for clues to boxes that may or may not be in the <br/>
  areas where I plan to travel.<br/>
<br/>
  And I'm sure David of Team New Hampshire will miss your stamp in his <br/>
  book as much as you'll miss his in yours, which is to say, not at <br/>
  all. You and what's-her-name in ME have fun playing with <br/>
  yourselves, and those special few with whom you happen to share your <br/>
  clues, m'kay?<br/>
<br/>
  What I liked best at the two gatherings I have thus far attended? <br/>
  (One of which I traveled over 900 miles to attend - yep, I'm hard-<br/>
  core, baby!) The welcoming, open, friendly attitude of the folks <br/>
  there! They work hard creating new boxes and putting the info out <br/>
  there for others to enjoy, and I have not yet heard the 3 most <br/>
  prolific planters I have met complain about missing boxes - they <br/>
  just write better clues! <br/>
<br/>
  So let me now say THANK YOU to you wonderful folks who go out there <br/>
  and create those lovely boxes and put the info out there for me and <br/>
  others to enjoy! It's a selfless act in many ways, and as I <br/>
  continue to work on my new series, I'm realizing how difficult it <br/>
  can be to "let go" when one has spent hours carving, making logs, <br/>
  finding good hidey-holes and writing creative, tricky, fun clues. I <br/>
  recently finished 3 stamps which are rather detailed and took quite <br/>
  a bit of time...one may have to be re-done simply because I messed <br/>
  up a bit on one side. It would pain me, yes, if these go missing. <br/>
  But I'll have the impression in my book, and I've started taking <br/>
  digital photos of my stamps, logs, and little felt stamp pouches <br/>
  (what a great idea!) so that if they do disappear, I'll still have a <br/>
  reminder of what went into that creation.<br/>
<br/>
  Again, Thank You to all friendly, welcoming, sharing letterboxers! <br/>
  I hope you keep them coming!<br/>

     Wow very well put Brian ! The words each his own comes to mind ! Been boxing only a little over a year and there are many aspects to this game ! I have noticed that ! But i also notice that some people are misread at times not all of what you read means what it is .The thing is everyone has there right to play this game the way they see fit !And being an American land of the free, it also means free to speak what you feel ! Just because a post sounds one sided doesn't mean its not open to discussion .That is what these groups are for ! So we may not like what we read but we do respect peoples thoughts !Please be kind to fellow boxers and find out why they feel the way they do, before you pass judgment !<br/>
<br/>
                                                                                        Wildcats<br/>

&gt; exclusionary. As a matter of fact, I see it as generous, she is <br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; to give people back a part of the game that many of us loved and cut<br/>
&gt; our teeth on. Why should Phyto be limited to what boxes she is <br/>
allowed<br/>
&gt; to find just because she is offering more than the average box and<br/>
&gt; straight-forward clue? Do you really think, or want, that the most<br/>
&gt; clever and imaginative box creators would limit themselves to what <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; two main clue sites have to offer in the way of clue placement or<br/>
&gt; composition? If so, you are missing a whole lot of what the game has<br/>
&gt; to offer. Maybe once you grow tired or bored of what you now know of<br/>
&gt; the game you will catch on and learn to appreciate some of the <br/>
nuances<br/>
&gt; and creativity that go way beyond what appears on the surface. I do<br/>
&gt; hope that you will keep an open mind, as I think you will enjoy what<br/>
&gt; lurks beneath.<br/>
