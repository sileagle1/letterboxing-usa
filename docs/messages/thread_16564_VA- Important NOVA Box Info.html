relocation. I checked on it yesterday, and it was out in the open and <br/>
scattered. The stamp and logbook were there, so I will relocate it in <br/>
the same park. A new hiking trail has been recently opened in the <br/>
park. It will be in a more out of the way spot. This is an unclaimed <br/>
box. If you are the placer, please get in touch with me. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
The trail that the Alice Series is on in Leesylvania State Park is <br/>
closed. The recent hurricane wiped out the bridges on the trail, and <br/>
they think it will take a year to replace them.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let people know.<br/>
