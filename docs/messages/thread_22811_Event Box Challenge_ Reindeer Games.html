<br/>
Christmas is coming, and before it gets too busy I thought I'd bring <br/>
up an event box challenge--the first of many, I hope. I'm planning a <br/>
new traveling event box for those winter gathers that are hosted here <br/>
and there throughout the LBNA. It will be called "Reindeer Games" and <br/>
have eight stamps, each depicting one of the eight tiny reindeer <br/>
famous for pulling Santa's sleigh. Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Blitzen, <br/>
Comet, Cupid, Donner, and Blitzen. <br/>
<br/>
Here's how the challenge will work. If you have an idea of what a <br/>
stamp featuring one of these reindeer should look like, make a quick <br/>
sketch, scan it in, and email it to me. I'm going for things like <br/>
Dancer dancing, Cupid with wings and a bow...you get the idea. Keep <br/>
in mind that the finished stamp should be no bigger than 3" square. <br/>
I'll look over all the submissions and announce the winners...and <br/>
then those stamps will be carved and the event box will have been <br/>
created. <br/>
<br/>
Does this sound like fun?<br/>
