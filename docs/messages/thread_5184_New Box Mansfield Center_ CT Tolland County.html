This box is part of a series of letterboxes being planted in honor of<br/>
Mansfields 300th Anniversary, 1702  2002.<br/>
<br/>
Mansfield in the late 1600s was a part of the Town of Windham. The area<br/>
around what is now Mansfield Center was called Ponde Place. Unhappy about<br/>
the distance they had to travel to go to church and town business, Ponde<br/>
Place was allowed to separate from Windham and was called Pond Town in 1702.<br/>
In 1703 it was incorporated by the General Court under the name of<br/>
Mansfield.<br/>
