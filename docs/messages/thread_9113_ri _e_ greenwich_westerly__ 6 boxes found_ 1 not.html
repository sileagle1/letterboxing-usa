                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went letterboxing on my own on Saturday and located the two <br/>
Frenchtown Park boxes in East Greenwich, RI.  Both boxes were in <br/>
place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, Rustypuff and I scoured Westerly, RI, for boxes with <br/>
mostly positive results.<br/>
<br/>
The Wooden Horse Carousel: Napatree Point LB was in place and dry, <br/>
but it would appear that a geocacher took the Drew's hand-carved <br/>
stamp and replaced it with a bumper sticker this past January.  But <br/>
then a thoughtful and well-supplied letterboxer, Susan from <br/>
Pittsburgh, PA, replaced the stamp with a store-bought one in <br/>
September.  Thank you, Susan!  We would have been mighty peeved to <br/>
have slogged all that way through the sand for no stamp at all!<br/>
<br/>
The Wooden Horse Carousel: Watch Hill Lighthouse LB was in place, <br/>
dry, and intact.  We'd like to note, however, that searchers may be <br/>
misled by the size of the other boulders and slabs in the area and <br/>
assume that the "flat piece of ridged concrete" is large and <br/>
immovable.  It is actually rounded and portable.  We hope the Drews <br/>
will not mind us making this clarification.<br/>
<br/>
Bird House Heaven is in place, dry, and intact.  Rustypuff counted 20 <br/>
birdhouses on the way out.<br/>
<br/>
The Westerly Woods LB was in place, somewhat damp, and intact as far <br/>
as contents goes.  The container, however, has seen better days and <br/>
should be replaced as it has a crack running down one end.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, the Wilcox Park LB is once again MIA.  I will contact a <br/>
member of RIBNAG personally to let them know, in case they don't <br/>
monitor this list.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Drew Clan, Kurdziels, and Wanda &amp; Pete, for introducing us <br/>
to all of these beautiful locations!<br/>
