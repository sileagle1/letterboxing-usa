nothing, so I'll pose my question for the group to answer.<br/>
<br/>
We are noticing a number of letterboxing clues that use compass <br/>
directions as a means for directing us towards the boxes.  In <br/>
general, we've noticed that such directions are only estimates and <br/>
not too precise (a good thing, in our opinion!).  However, some clues <br/>
for boxes we've not yet hunted have more precise degree <br/>
instructions.  For example, Team Green Dragon's Time Travels box <br/>
(listed on the LbNA database) lists degree readings of 130, 230, 33, <br/>
240, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now, following a degree reading of 33 degress might be hard enough <br/>
given the precision of that ... but it could be near impossible if <br/>
the clue writer used a compass which was adjusted for declination <br/>
while I am not or vice versa -- or if the declination adjustment <br/>
varies from his compass to mine.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I purchased a Suunto M-2D compass with an adjustable <br/>
declination correction scale and set it to 15 degrees west per the <br/>
map provided with the compass.<br/>
<br/>
Using it with some clues, it's become obvious that some clue writers <br/>
are not using such compasses.<br/>
<br/>
Whether Team Green Dragon did or not isn't really my point, but the <br/>
overall question is what is more common for clues -- declination <br/>
adjusted readings (meaning the degree headings relate to the <br/>
geographic north pole and are proper) or not (meaing the degree <br/>
headings relate to the magnetic north pole are improper)?<br/>
<br/>
Either way it doesn't matter to me, I just wish not to get out in the <br/>
woods somewhere trying to read clues with a 15 degree margin of error!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's no need to adjust for declination if you're using a compass only <br/>
(no map). I would imagine that any degree reading shown to locate a Lb <br/>
would be magnetic. If you and the placer were standing in the same <br/>
place, 130* on the placer's compass should be 130* on yours too. If you <br/>
adjust declination on yours by 15* and the placer didn't then yes you <br/>
will go astray.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen this come up before so it'll be interesting to see how <br/>
others respond. If you get into Orienteering, the O-maps are adjusted <br/>
for declination.<br/>

&gt;I did a search in this group for "declination" and came up with nothing, so<br/>
I'll pose my question for the group to answer.<br/>
<br/>
I've often wondered the same thing...  I really wonder if most people even know<br/>
what declination is much less use it.  From my experience (many years of using<br/>
and teaching map and compass in the Scouts and arctic survival training where,<br/>
BTW, compasses only marginally work) the readings given are probably only<br/>
magnetic readings and not all that accurate.  We usually use the compass to get<br/>
the general direction and then look for stated landmarks to get a bit closer to<br/>
the prize...<br/>
<br/>
I doubt you could ever get a consensus as to how it should be done - much<br/>
simpler discussions brings much dissention and arguments.  I'll just go on<br/>
assuming the placer just took the compass reading as a magnetic reading and go<br/>
from there.  I have never seen clues that stated declination was taken into<br/>
account...<br/>

Unless the clue explictly states otherwise, it's generally safe to <br/>
assume the degrees mentioned in clues are magnetic.  And typically, <br/>
you can expect them to be accurate to within about 5 degrees.  For <br/>
most boxes, that's plenty accurate to get the finder to the letterbox.<br/>

Then your declination adjustments should be used.  Otherwise, I understood that nearly all compass readings for letterboxing are based on Magnetic North and I shouldn't need to worry about declination.  I do agree that there may be some people out there who are writing clues and have never thought about the difference, but still they would tend to go by magnetic North if they haven't given thought to it, correct?   A related problem I have run into with many clues is that sometimes it is not stated whether you should remain on that compass bearing after a certain turn in a path or after the beginning of a new path, or whether the compass bearing should be ignored once the new path is found, so that you remain on the path. I would like to know which I should be doing, but many clues don't bother to say.  Could be part of being mysterious, but to me there are other things that can be mysterious without being so ambiguous there.  There are plenty of places where it would be a lot safer to know whether you are to stay on a path or get off it.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

in very handy!  They always indicate what the declination is for the <br/>
map, many state trail maps do also.  <br/>
<br/>
My archaeology survey days had me lugging around a huge brunton <br/>
compas and always adjusting for magnetic declination, or our test <br/>
pits would be crooked (we always used to joke, they'll look better <br/>
when we put them on the map)!  It's a joy to use a light weight trail <br/>
compas and magnetic north!  <br/>
<br/>
We had to wonder, though, with a couple boxes we've done, if the <br/>
placer was taking bearing from magnetic north, or a bearing simply <br/>
from the direction they happen to be standing in? ie: they're facing <br/>
a sign that is not to the north, but they say "look for a sign and <br/>
take a reading of 45*" ... now does that mean, a magnetic reading of <br/>
45* from north? or 45* from the direction facing the sign?  (We <br/>
finally found it, it turned out to be 45* from facing toward the <br/>
sign).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dawnlanders ... what a worthwhile observation!  Letterboxers, perhaps <br/>
we can agree on this as well?  Certainly 45 from north (be it <br/>
magnetic or geographic) will send a letterboxer in a completely <br/>
different direction that 45 from the direction your facing if that <br/>
direction isn't north!  Perhaps we should either agree that compass <br/>
readings should always be from north or that clues should be a tad <br/>
more specific if they are not (such as in the example the Dawnlanders <br/>
give below).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I, too, think that most letterboxers assume that magnetic north is <br/>
being referenced, i.e. that your compass, unadjusted for local <br/>
magnetic declination, will correctly point the way. Few clue-writers <br/>
even address the problem. Probably, most of us don't have an <br/>
adjustable compass in the first place, and making a mental adjustment <br/>
is a bit touchy (quick: + or - ?).<br/>
An obvious advantage of all using magnetic north is that you don't <br/>
have to know anything about the variable declination;  your compass <br/>
will tell you the same 'truth' as anyone else's, wherever you go.<br/>

&gt; We are noticing a number of letterboxing clues that use compass <br/>

&gt; general, we've noticed that such directions are only estimates and <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">    It behooves a placer to put some sort of landmark - nicely identifiable - as a back-up direction to clues posted.  Some troubles include there not *being* a nice, outstanding marker to use in addition to a compass reading (trackless jungle, desert, etc...).  I leave the solution to *that* one as a study for the diligent student.<br/>
    If your so declined to.<br/>
    I've also seen more than once people refer in clues to "turning around to 180 degrees" when they meant to say "Turn around 180 degrees", meaning "turn around".<br/>
    But I do bear in mind that most letterboxers keep a compass handy, and availability of maps is sometimes iffy.<br/>
