 We are thinking about pursuing some boxes from the following <br/>

Wickaboxet group.  We've already found the boxes in Narragansett, and <br/>
some of the Charlestown group.  Any help or suggestions will be <br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>

The only ones that I know are missing but the clues are still posted <br/>
are Frosty Drew Quest and Perfect Summer Day.  The Harbor of Refuge <br/>
boxes are all gone as are the old LMW/YIMS Pt Judiths, but these <br/>
clues have been pulled from the on-line list (in case you are working <br/>
off an old hardcopy list).<br/>

yesterday with B_weekendwarrior and we couldn't find PORGY ---knew we <br/>

went out! oh well---nice walk any way! We didn't have time to check <br/>
BASS.  But we did find Point Judith in good condition and we found <br/>
Midnight on the Moon in good condition. We set out a hitchhiker in <br/>
Rhode Island yesterday too!!  Thanks for the update on Missing <br/>
