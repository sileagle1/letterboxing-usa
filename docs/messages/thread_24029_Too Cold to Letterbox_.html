There can be a problem with snow, however.  Sometimes the landmarks are not visible - mossy rock is one that comes to mind.  Also, boxes can be frozen in place.  I tried getting a box out of a cairn once and it wouldn't budge.  I had to open the box in the hole, drag out the contents, then put them back in the box and closing it inside the hole.  Quite an operation!  I also don't like leaving tracks to a box, so I'll  "mess up an area" with tracks going in other directions to distract any curious hikers.  Isn't letterboxing fun!<br/>

I definately prefer winter boxing over summer boxing as long as there isn't too much snow.<br/>

Hmmm...not sure exactly how cold it was when we were out boxing in <br/>
Boise &amp; NE Oregon (Jan 04) &amp; the DC area (Jan/Feb 04) but in Boise we <br/>
found multiple letterboxes frozen to concrete, rocks and in earth.  One <br/>
box was so stubborn I wasted an entire can of de-icer spray on it and <br/>
it wouldn't budge!  We had to leave multiple boxes in place without <br/>
stamping in--nothing more frustrating than seeing a box, touching a box <br/>
but not being able to 'get to it'.  Another box at an Interstate rest <br/>
stop we had to dig through about 3 feet of snow and climb over 15' tall <br/>
snowdrifts just to reach--to avoid leading a trail directly to the box <br/>
we ran circles in the snow in every which way just to lose the trail.  <br/>
Several times on that trip we resorted to wearing snow shoes just to <br/>
travel along the trail while letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
In DC we went out for a 5-mile hike and kept 'ice skating' in hiking <br/>
boots along the trail as it was completely covered in thick ice! Much <br/>
later on in the day, the temps warmed up and then our feet kept <br/>
cracking through the ice/snow and falling about 2 feet.  That was <br/>
insane!<br/>

not much snow. <br/>
<br/>
One winter day I went out when there was about a foot of fresh snow on<br/>
the ground. I got to the trailhead out in the country and the parking<br/>
area was not plowed (which is to be expected). Not wanting to risk<br/>
getting stuck, I did a u-turn on the country road. I got too close to<br/>
the edge of the snow-filled ditch (couldn't judge where the edge of<br/>
the road ended and the ditch began) then slowly slid down into the<br/>
ditch. Lucky for me I had an automobile association card with me and<br/>
my cell phone. Unlucky for me I was in the middle of a long country<br/>
road with no road signs nearby, so I couldn't tell the tow truck<br/>
company where I was. I had to rely on the kindness of strangers and<br/>
flagged a car down. Being female I was very nervous about my<br/>
predicament. The driver knew what road we were on and what tiny town<br/>
we were near but the tow company didn't know the town or the road.<br/>
Eventually a few people stopped to help and one man in a pick-up had a<br/>
tow line, 3 other men helped guide the car out. <br/>
<br/>
Now I'm really reluctant to go out into the middle of nowhere when the<br/>
road conditions aren't at least adequate. I tend to stick to more<br/>
urban boxes where I can get safe parking in a plowed lot. <br/>

For us, it's not the temperature, but whether it is<br/>
too windy or too precipitious.<br/>
