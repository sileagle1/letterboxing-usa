                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received an email today from the church pastor in Salem CT requesting that I remove the "In Search of the Church Grim" letterbox from it's hiding place in the cemetery. I went down there today and took out the box. It is no longer there. There are now no boxes in that cemetery. I will make another "In Search of the Church Grim " letterbox at a later date. It will be in an entirely new location, not that cemetery,with a new stamp, new log book. The old log book and stamp will be retired. .....Chuck and Molly<br/>
