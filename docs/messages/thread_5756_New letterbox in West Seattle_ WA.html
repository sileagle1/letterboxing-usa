<div>Hey everyone!</div>
<div>I'm newish to letterboxing.  Have to "blame" Eliza B. for getting 
me hooked.  I've found the 3 cool boxes in Schmitz Park and just 
placed my 1st one today--woohoo!</div>
<div>And speaking of E.B., if you're quick you might find a hitchhiker in this 
box...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p>NAME: Mee-Kwa-Mooks Low Tide</p>
<p>LOCATION: 4504 Beach Drive SW, West Seattle, WA</p>
<p>DIFFICULTY: easy, but way overgrown. Might want long sleeves &amp; pants </p>
<p>PLACED: 6.15.02</p>
<p>BY: Jill the Reckless</p>
<p>Getting there: Take the West Seattle Bridge exit from either direction of 
I-5. Follow it to the end and continue straight as it becomes Fauntleroy Ave SW. 
Turn right on 47<sup>th</sup> Ave SW. Bear left on Lincoln Park Way SW then 
right on Beach Drive SW. Mee-Kwa-Mooks Park is on the right side.</p>
<p>I found out on the web that Mee-Kwa-Mooks Park is the site of the homestead 
of pioneers Ferdinand and Emma Schmitz. The Emma Schmitz Viewpoint is across the 
road. Its a great place to explore tidepools at low tide. My stamp reflects 
this theme rather than the lush, overgrown coolness of the actual park. 
Doh!</p>
<p>Finding the box: From the street youll see a meadowy area. Head left toward 
the "Pack It Out" sign. Take approx. 20 steps to a ruined stairway arched by ivy 
on the right. Climb up until you come to a wall. Turn left ducking under 
branches and follow an old wall. Take the stairs on the right. Youll come to a 
clearing and another wall. Youll know it by the large orange graffiti "THC". 
Follow that wall to the left. The path actually ends at a chain link fence. On 
your right youll see two tall ivy covered trees. A large slim branch is growing 
out from the trees across the path. Slide under the branch and at the base of it 
youll find the letterbox hidden under loose pieces of bark. </p>
<p>Getting back out: For you artists, an alternate return path. Return to the 
orange "THC". Go through the clearing over some loose stones and past a sort of 
Lord of the Flies (according to my husband ;-) ring of stones. Follow the mosaic 
stepping stones and a little stream. Youll come out at the junction of SW 
Oregon St. and 56<sup>th</sup> Ave SW. Follow the pavement to the main road, 
Beach Dr. SW.</p></div>
