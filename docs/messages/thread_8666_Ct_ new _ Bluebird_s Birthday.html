BLUEBIRD'S BIRTHDAY<br/>
North Madison, Connecticut<br/>
Placed, October, 2002 <br/>
By  Butterfly<br/>
<br/>
This was a surprise letterbox planted in celebration for  Bluebird's  Birthday.
It is a Tag-A-Long to her boxes :<br/>
<i>The Indian Rock Shelters Trail Letterbox </i> in North Madison, Ct. <br/>
Follow the directions to <i>The Indian Rock Shelters Trail Letterbox</i>.
 The cave shelters are wonderful, and the two boxes are fun to find. After
you have found the" Lazy Rocks"  Letterbox , continue on the blue trail,
crossing a seasonal brook, and soon passing a short stone wall on your left.
Be careful not to trip on the big tree roots, and quarts rocks [no loose
ones Jay ] peeking up at you.  The many ghostly fronds of ferns beckon you
to visit again in the spring when they are in their glory. Notice that the
trail passes between seven large Beech trees. Soon you will come to an outcropping
of large rocks on your right. They look as if a giant had tossed them into
a pile. Some large trees on the top seem to be growing out of pure rock.
Find the large chest high white quartz ":mosaic"; rock right in the front
of the pile. It calls to children and the child within to climb up. Stand
on the top of that "mosaic" rock and face west. Look 340 degrees to a tall 
Maple tree that at this time has a dead branch leaning against it. The Bluebird's
Birthday letterbox is in the tree on the north side behind a trap door.<br/>
Happy Birthday , Bluebird,  from Butterfly.<br/>
Continue on the blue trail and back to your car.<br/>
