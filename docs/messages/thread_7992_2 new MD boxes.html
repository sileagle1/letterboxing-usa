Savage, MD<br/>
Placed: September 24, 02<br/>
By: Firefly<br/>
Difficulty: easy<br/>
<br/>
The trail head can be located at the Truss Bridge on Foundry Street in Savage.  Park your car on Foundry Street, next to the bridge.  (Parking is not permitted between 8:00 p.m and 6:00 a.m. so sorry, no midnight boxing here!)<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the north end of the bridge.  Read the history markers on the right and head south across the bridge.  (You could begin at the south end too, but then you wouldn't get to cross the cool bridge, and what fun is that?!)<br/>
<br/>
Bear right onto the trail, passing the info boards.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Mr. Bollman's box</b><br/>
Continue down the trail to the first trash can.  About face!  Take 35 steps.  Take a bearing of 20 degrees.  Look <i>carefully</i> to see the "JM" tree.  What you seek is at the base of the tree.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Truss box<br/>
</b>Continue down the trail past two more trash cans.  See black sign on the right.  Discover stone steps leading down the hill on the right.  Count 7 from the top.  Take another 20 degree reading.  Between two BIG rocks and two LITTLE trees you shall find a TINY treasure!<br/>
<br/>
This would be a really nice place to enjoy a little lunch on the rocks.  There is a beautiful view of the Little Patuxent River, including some pretty little waterfalls.<br/>
<br/>
Please be discrete when finding these boxes.  They are both very close to the trail.  And please rehide carefully!  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
I also highly recommend making a day out of this and visiting the Shops at Savage Mill.  The Mill has been renovated to house MANY very cool artsy stores, antique shops, and restaurants.  Wandering around the Mill is an all day event!<br/>
More info on the Mill can be found at www.savagemill.com<br/>
