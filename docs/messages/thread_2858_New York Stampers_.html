                    <html><body>There have 2 stamp conventions at the South Jersey Expo Center in Pennsauken 
<br/>every year. Both are put on by Heirloom productions.   The expo center 
<br/>address is:
<br/>
<br/>2323 Route 73 
<br/>Pennsauken NJ 
<br/>(856) 661-0200
<br/>
<br/>The next one is August 4th and 5th.  
<br/>
<br/>They have them every april and august.  The april one is much better and 
<br/>bigger but both are still really great.  Most of the vendors are from private 
<br/>stamp companies.  Suze Weinburg has a booth in April. She does free demos all 
<br/>weekend. There are free classes and demos going on all over the place.  
<br/>Several booths also offer free make and takes.  You can stock up on supplies 
<br/>and most companies sell both Mounted and Unmounted stamps.  I love it and go 
<br/>to both every year.
