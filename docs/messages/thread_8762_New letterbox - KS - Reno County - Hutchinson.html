Difficulty - medium.  It wasn't too easy to find obvious landmarks on <br/>
the path<br/>
Time - 30 minutes<br/>
Directions to starting place - North of Hutchinson on Hwy K-61.<br/>
Access is at East 69th street. Go to the first parking lot.  <br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - Sandhills State Park is about 1,200 acres<br/>
of sand prairie habitat that is filled with wildlife.  There is a per <br/>
person fee to walk through this park.  I think it's $2.50 a day.<br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know - I saw wonderful grassy dunes at the <br/>
other end of the park.  Lots and lots of nettles in my socks and <br/>
shoes.  I read somewhere that the place is full of sandhill plums, <br/>
which only makes sense, I suppose.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:	<br/>
Follow the cement path from the parking lot toward the "women" sign. <br/>
When you reach the park bench, fork off the cement onto a trail to <br/>
your right and southwest.  <br/>
Cross the bridge.  <br/>
Fairly soon you will come to a stopping place.  There is a picnic <br/>
table, a bench and a mailbox.  <br/>
Go a little beyond that and take a right at the park bench and then a <br/>
right fork when the option appears.<br/>
You will come to a tree that crosses over the trail.  Walk 50 paces <br/>
(100 steps) to <br/>
 the two trunked tree that has one trunk growing up straight and<br/>
the <br/>
other looks like it is bent over and looks like it is growing back <br/>
toward the ground.  There are some fallen trees on the other side of <br/>
the trail.  From here, take 12 paces (24 steps) to the trail's right <br/>
turn.  <br/>
When the trail makes a fairly clear right hand turn start counting 24 <br/>
paces (48 steps).<br/>
Letterbox is on the left side of the trail behind a fallen log with <br/>
another downed log lying across it.	<br/>
