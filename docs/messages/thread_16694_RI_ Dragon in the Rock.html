                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went out for a Sunday hike...or mountain climb...today and had a <br/>
wonderful time at the Long/Ell Pond Nature Preserve in Rockville. We <br/>
had found "Too Be Precise..." a month or two ago and skipped the <br/>
dragon due to impending darkness. The place was packed today with <br/>
late-autumn leaf peepers climbing the northern peak. <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, it was a very strenous hike and we would NOT suggest a <br/>
beginner or one with children to attempt this hike. The scenery is <br/>
stunning -- one of the few places to find Hemlock/Rhodendron forest <br/>
outside of Green Falls in CT. The box was a tough find, but well <br/>
worth the hike! <br/>
<br/>
Heidi freaked out when we saw a 4' black rat snake on the way <br/>
back...outside of that little "incident" it was a pleasant day : )<br/>
Soooo, just a reminder that you better check before sticking your <br/>
hands in cracks and crevices in the rocks! And watch where you step <br/>
on the trail! <br/>

PS - Mike and Christine -- The box needs some attention, a critter <br/>
has chewed a good portion of the blue rubber on the top. <br/>
