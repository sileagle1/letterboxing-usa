                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found the Fort Trumbull letterbox this past weekend and wanted to <br/>
let the owner know that the log book is almost full.  There are about <br/>
6-8 pages left.<br/>
<br/>
The cover to one of the small ink pads has been missing for a while, <br/>
or so the logbook said and the baggie that the two pads were in is <br/>
quite dirty due to the missing cover.  I would have replaced with a <br/>
new one but I didn't have a baggie with me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great stamp and the hunt!<br/>
