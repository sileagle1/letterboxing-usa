and was wondering what boxes were missing. I hope to get to out but <br/>
again it looks like it is going to rain. <br/>
<br/>
I was told the Meditation Garden and the Redwing II boxes, as indicated on the Letterbox site, were missing. The Green Tea and Glad Cow boxes are still around, those were the first two I found and I just started doing this. Going to try for the St. Paul's Cannonball today.<br/>
<br/>
Peace, KL<br/>
