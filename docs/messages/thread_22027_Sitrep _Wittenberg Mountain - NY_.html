<br/>
	 Rob  was up from LA. so we hiked up and checked the box. It was full of<br/>
brown water from the ink pad ozzing into it all. Took the box but left<br/>
some paper, the stamp ,a pen and the last (only) log from a sign it from<br/>
10/20/04 who happened to find it. Put it under the rock and will have to<br/>
check it again next time(next year?).......<br/>
<br/>
 BTW , about 30 people hiked the 3.5 miles to have a wedding done up<br/>
there today on the top of this mountain! They had to hike up steep, wet<br/>
slippery ledges over loose rock and very rough terrain. Good to see the<br/>
"seniors" out and determined to get to the top for this celebration.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Bud had to stay home because it's just to difficult for a<br/>
blind and deaf dog.  He has his local park to walk around at......."The<br/>
bridge to Nowhere" park in Mt. Tremper<br/>
<br/>
Have a fun Memorial letterboxing day!  ..................... Budster of<br/>
the Catskills<br/>
