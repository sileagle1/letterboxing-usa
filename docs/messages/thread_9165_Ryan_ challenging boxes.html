The answer is yes we have mountains you call them foothills! Me being <br/>

    If it wasn't for us easterners the west coast will still be <br/>

eating McDonalds right before going out to find or plant a box so it will <br/>
leave an inviting smell to every critter around or...<br/>

We'll have to work our way up to the more physically challenging ones at a <br/>
stage later in life (like when the children are in college -- we'll have the <br/>
time to hike for miles and miles and we'll be broke and in need of fun, free <br/>
recreation!)<br/>
<br/>
It is fun reading about everyone's trail adventures!  We're having a great <br/>
time with the more weenie boxes and loving it!  BeMa<br/>

I'll have you know, there were TWO boxes at the end of that hike!  <br/>
=)  Anyhow, in that particular case, there are other options of <br/>
getting to the boxes such as rafting or flying.  Not having a raft or <br/>
an airplane, though, I had to set out on foot.<br/>

Speaking of turtles, when we were out East a couple of weeks ago and <br/>
we were trying to find the Allen Pond Park boxes (Bowie, MD) in the <br/>
DRIVING RAINSTORM, we took a bit longer than normal to find the <br/>
boxes (as the clues were a bit confusing).  One point along the <br/>
hike, we found a turtle at the base of a tree that we were convinced <br/>
was where the letterbox was supposed to be.  Talk about <br/>
surprises!!!  We eventually found the letterbox but boy was that <br/>
exciting. We hadn't come across a turtle near a tree in the West <br/>
during our adventures in letterboxing.  Up until that time, we'd <br/>
only seen them in the ponds and sunbathing on logs...  ;)<br/>
