Dear Ashenbrodel (Cinderella),<br/>
<br/>
Should your bedknob turn our way, should Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang <br/>
start to fly toward our Atlantian kingdom, should a flying carpet <br/>
lift you away from your tiger, and deposit you here, pray give us a <br/>
call. Please? <br/>
<br/>
It was delightful to see your stamp on some of our boxes. Got the <br/>
easy ones, I note. Hope you find time to decode some of my Middle <br/>
Earth ones before the movie Return of the King comes out this year. <br/>
JugglerMouse carved some of them and they are worth the effort. Just <br/>
planted "Return of the King" and "Treebeard" but have not put up the <br/>
clues yet.<br/>
<br/>
I have started planting the Peter Pan boxes, My Wendy-go, and will <br/>
make the clues fairly straight forward. First one up is Peter Pan's <br/>
Shadow. <br/>
<br/>
We are really aiming at having over a 100 boxes in San Luis Obispo <br/>
Co. before the Oct 4th event.<br/>
<br/>
Your servant, my Princess,<br/>
Sir Balthazar<br/>

Do not, Dark Knight, presume that a box not gotten means a clue undeciphered. <br/>
Ney--all have been decoded. One's steed needs rest and other of life's <br/>
necessities beckon. <br/>
<br/>
The temptation of 100 boxes is, indeed, alluring and I shall try the journey <br/>
but may have to send a proxy, my fair and newly tested letterboxing Cuz, Kym <br/>
and her Mushroom Man, in my stead. Ye shant be disappointed.<br/>
