Salamander. Location: Chillicothe, Ohio. No. of boxes: 1.  The <br/>
Chinese Zodiac is based on a 12 year cycle, each year being <br/>
associated with a certain animal,and with that animal's <br/>
characteristics. Many people believe that these characteristics <br/>
affect what happens during the year, and also that people born in a <br/>
given year will display the qualities of that year's animal. One <br/>
legend has it that the Chinese Zodiac originated when Buddha invited <br/>
all the animals of China to come visit him. However, only twelve <br/>
came. To honor each of these animals for its devotion, Buddha <br/>
created a year for each one: the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, <br/>
Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. This letterbox <br/>
celebrates the Year of the Dragon.  CLUES: Go to the Yoctangee Park <br/>
Annex in Chillicothe, Ohio. Follow the entrance road towards the <br/>
left, past the soccer fields, until you reach the shelterhouse. Look <br/>
for a red metal gate nearby. Stand at the wooden post which is <br/>
approximately 4 feet to the north of the north end of the gate, and <br/>
take a compass reading of 112 degrees. 29 paces at that heading will <br/>
bring you to a large tree. The box is hidden among the roots at the <br/>
base of this tree.<br/>
