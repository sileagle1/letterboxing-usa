them to your container in such a manner as to ensure their permanence.<br/>
<br/>
I use Exterior Goop, Gorilla Glue or Epoxy to attach dissimilar materials together. If you need flexibility, I use <br/>
Goop. If you need complete adhesive power, then Gorilla Glue or Epoxy.<br/>
<br/>
The 'attaching power' or strength of the magnet is  of importance.  Mine attach and hold to metal like there was no <br/>
tomorrow and people have told me that it takes 2 strong men and a boy to get them to come free from whatever they are <br/>
attached to.  (Just kidding!)  But, since this is how you are hiding it, you can't skimp on the magnet.  I purchase <br/>
mine from Electronic Surplus parts places.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have seen a magnetic micro-box very cleverly done using magnets on <br/>
the outside of the film canister, and then the entire deal, canister <br/>
and magnets, wrapped tightly with tape -- in this case it was a drab <br/>
color fabric tape to blend with its surroundings.  Attaching the <br/>
magnets with tape around the outside eliminated the problem of the <br/>
glue not holding.  The tape did not seem to weaken the strenth of <br/>
the magnet at all.  It was attached to something magnetic and very <br/>
difficult to pry off -- I doubt it would ever fall off on its own.<br/>
<br/>
I had a question for those who had mentioned super-glueing magnets <br/>
to the hiding spot...  What kind of a hiding spot are you talking <br/>
off?  I am curious because to me permanently affixing a magnet to <br/>
something for the purpose of placing a letterbox, kind of goes <br/>
against the philosophy of "leave no trace" and borders on damage of <br/>
property.  But perhaps that is just my interpretation.<br/>
