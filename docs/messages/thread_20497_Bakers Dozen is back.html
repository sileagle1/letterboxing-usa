Thank you for all your help when we were in Dartmoor. You were terrific. Hope you had half as much fun as we did! (we all know Rubaduc had 3 times as much fun as anyone else!!!) Thanks for being such a good sport.<br/>
Okay now, what did we miss?<br/>

Thanks for your mail, It was an absolute pleasure to be on the moor with you all and I had a fantastic time.<br/>
Mark Pepe has a copy of a bonus stamp for the "Beware of Snakes" box that we found, remember the one with the jumpy snake thing???lol He should be distibuting it throughout the Bakers Dozen.<br/>
Have fun and speak soon,<br/>
