friend, I've decided to jump in whole heartedly.  I've <br/>
just finished building 9 boxes to place and I was <br/>
wondering if anyone would be interested in a linked box <br/>
letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
In other words, I've found an 11 mile trail near where I <br/>
live and would oike to carve a series of related stamps <br/>
and place them along this 11 mile trail.  I would post the <br/>
clues to each box on the website, but, inside the ones <br/>
that are on the website, at each one of those, I would <br/>
branch out from that one, with 1 or 2 more bloxes that are <br/>
'secret' as in the clues are only inside the 'public' <br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone done anything like this? Would people be <br/>
interested in a 'cahin' of letterboxes perse?<br/>

11 miles is a little long for a one day hike. It may help if there's a <br/>
parking area half-way...or a campsite :) IMHO.<br/>

This sounds like a great idea! You might want to check out the Wizard<br/>
of Oz series in (I think) Rhode Island. I've been told by a local<br/>
boxer here in Richmond, VA who's boxed it that it is set up in a<br/>
similar fashion. She says the clue to the first box is on the Web but<br/>
no more. Once you find the first box, inside it are little pieces of<br/>
paper with the clues to the second box along the trail that all the<br/>
boxes are on. You take a copy and go to the second box. In the second<br/>
box are papers with clues to the third box, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
An 11-mile-long trail IS pretty far to box, as another poster said.<br/>
But as long as you tell boxers about the length in the clues<br/>
beforehand, IMHO, it's up to them to take on what they know they can<br/>
handle. If it takes them an entire weekend, that's their deal. If they<br/>
only get some of the boxes because they can only spare a day or a<br/>
portion of a day, that's up to them, too. If they get them all in one<br/>
fell swoop because they're Amazons or something, more power to them!<br/>
<br/>
Hope your series ends up being feasibly near where I live! Good luck!<br/>
