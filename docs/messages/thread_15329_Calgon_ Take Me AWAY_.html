gotta say that the whole argument thing that's been going on here is getting<br/>
tiresome.  I only get the digest and that's too much for me to slog through.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I used to get 'warm fuzzies' from reading this list , now it is more like<br/>
treading through 'dust bunnies'......lol.  <br/>
<br/>
No one should be afraid to post for fear of being lambasted,  if their posts<br/>
are thoughtfully presented.....I personally have felt uncomfortable posting<br/>
lately and I've been here a little over a year now.<br/>
<br/>
Still enjoy letterboxing, but not the list so much.( I know, no one cares if<br/>
I enjoy the list......don't let the cyber-door hit me in the behind on the<br/>
way out) :)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

PS: Been meaning to tell Amanda that we found her Sedona boxes last month.  Enjoyed the canyon and the stamps!<br/>
