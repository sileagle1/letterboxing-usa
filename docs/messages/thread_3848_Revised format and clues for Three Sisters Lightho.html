Nearest Town:  Eastham, Cape Cod, MA<br/>
County:  Barnstable<br/>
Date:  Original Placed October 2000; Replaced October 2001<br/>

Driving Directions: Take Route 6 towards Provincetown. Turn right on Nauset<br/>
Road (near the National Seashore Visitor Center), and follow it to Coast<br/>
Guard Beach. Turn left onto Ocean View Drive, and follow it to the Nauset<br/>
Beach parking lot. This letterbox is best found off-season.<br/>
<br/>
If you're fond of sand dunes and salty air<br/>
Quaint little villages here and there<br/>
You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod<br/>
<br/>
If you like the taste of lobster stew<br/>
Served by a window with an ocean view<br/>
You're sure to fall in love with old Cape Cod<br/>
<br/>
Winding roads that seem to beckon you<br/>
Miles of green beneath a sky of blue<br/>
Church bells chimin' on a Sunday morn<br/>
Remind you of the town where you were born<br/>
<br/>
If you spend an evening you'll want to stay<br/>
Watching the moonlight on Cape Cod Bay<br/>
You're sure to fall in love with Old Cape Cod<br/>

We invite you to visit Cape Cod to find and hide letterboxes. There are now<br/>
six lighthouse letterboxes on the Cape with more planned.<br/>
<br/>
The three women who once sang to the sea in Eastham now sing to you.  Use<br/>
the clues to get to 'three women singing--- 'light, love and joy' letterbox.<br/>
If you follow the clues you will be pleasantly surprised to find them<br/>
standing so proud in a small opening near Nauset light.<br/>
<br/>
When we stumbled upon these three women in October 2000, as we were hiking<br/>
on Cape Cod, we just knew that we would plant a letterbox here and when you<br/>
visit you will understand why.  We invite you to sit for a moment when you<br/>
find your letterbox.  Let the gentle ocean breeze and stillness of the area<br/>
envelop you and we know that you will feel the experience of light love and<br/>
joy as you enjoy beauty of these three guardians.<br/>
