A few weeks ago, I recall someone asking about letterboxes that are <br/>
still active in DC and ther Northern Virginia area - they got lots of <br/>
responses, if I remember correctly. I am going to be travelling with <br/>
soem friends to this area in June and was hoping to get as many of <br/>
these letterboxes as I can. However, I can't seem to find the <br/>
original post with suggestions. Does anyone have a copy of it? Or, if <br/>
not, is there anyone on this list who has placed on in that <br/>
particular region and could send me their clues? Thanks!<br/>
