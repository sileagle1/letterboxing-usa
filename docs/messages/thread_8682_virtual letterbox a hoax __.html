<br/>
I have done all 8 of Candlelight's virtual letterboxes and enjoyed <br/>
the "hunt" and the beautiful picture/image you got at the end.  I <br/>
just did Wren's virtual letterbox.  When you complete the letterbox <br/>
there is no beautiful picture/image at the end.  Instead there is a <br/>
message telling you to email him/her your home address and he/she <br/>
will send you futher instructions for an image swap.  <br/>
<br/>
I do not give out my home address to just anyone on the web who <br/>
happens to ask for it.  I was very disappointed in this virtual <br/>
letterbox.  When you finish there is nothing there :(<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering how others felt about this.<br/>

Dear Moonstone Baby,<br/>
<br/>
You are not alone in your sentiments.  I posted about this on message <br/>
17846:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Renee,<br/>
<br/>
I love your online letterbox site. I did solve the puzzle and <br/>
received my code word, but I am reluctant to send my Real Life name <br/>
and address over the 'net, which your site requires. I realize that <br/>
this means that we will not be able to swap images.<br/>
<br/>
Since others may have the same reserve, might I suggest an <br/>
alternative? Perhaps the images could be swapped as .jpg files via <br/>
email, thus allowing participants to maintain their anonymity. You <br/>
may find that more folks would be willing to play that way.<br/>
<br/>
Just my $.02.<br/>
