<br/>
Clan Jiggs planted this LB on the 15th of Aug near the duty free <br/>
store near the Thousdand Islands Bridge in NY/ON.<br/>
<br/>
We received 2 reports, one from the first finders, the second from <br/>
some LBers who had the misfortune of being caught by the customs <br/>
folks and having the stamp confiscated. <br/>
<br/>
When I went to amend the clues on this website, I found that they <br/>
had been already removed by a person or persons unknown. <br/>
<br/>
If this is the work of the moderators, so be it - but it sure would <br/>
have been nice to at least receive some sort of courtesy email <br/>
giving me the option of doing so.<br/>
<br/>
We had intended to replant the box at a more discreet location, but <br/>
I no longer have access to clues to this LB...<br/>
<br/>
We'll go back to lurking now...<br/>
