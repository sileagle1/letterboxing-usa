have been in, but no box.  My daughter was looking at the water and <br/>
asked me to come look at what she found.  It turned out to be the <br/>
bottom of the letterbox.  We looked around some more and found the <br/>
lid.  Much looking later but no log book or stamp.  Looks like this <br/>
box was found and just thrown into the water.  Not a nice thing to <br/>
happen!  <br/>
