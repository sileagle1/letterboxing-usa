vacation to Virgin Gorda we decided to leave one behind!  I don't <br/>
expect it to get much trafic but if you're staying in the American <br/>
Virgin Islands or taking a cruise, Virgin Gorda is a wonderful place <br/>
to visit and Gorda Peak (which takes second billing to the Baths as <br/>
the place to visit) has an incredible view of the island.  It's worth <br/>
the rocky hike just for this view, the letterbox is just a bonus.  <br/>
Remember your passport, Vigin Gorda is part of the British Virgin <br/>
Islands.<br/>
