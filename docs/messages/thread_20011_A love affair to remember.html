I feel like an old timer in the world of letterboxing.  I recall <br/>
that Thanksgiving in 1998 when one of our dearest friends visited <br/>
us. He had just discovered the hobby from one of our mutual friends <br/>
from Texas who was into rubber stamping art and had run across the <br/>
Smithsonian article. We sat up all night searching the Internet for <br/>
anything we could find on the hobby. Back then there was so little <br/>
to be found! Massachusetts had 2 boxes placed by Bonnie...NH had ONE <br/>
placed by Danielle, and Vermont had  9, placed by Eric and Susan and <br/>
Tom Cooch.  And that was all there was!  I subsequently placed the <br/>
first box on Cape Cod -The Secrets of the Knob which is still active <br/>
today. It was the start of a love of affair for all of us with this <br/>
great hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Our friend is now known in the letterboxing world as Lonemasswolf. <br/>
We are just Rae and Jerry.  In August 2000, Lonemasswolf met the <br/>
woman of his dreams when he took the lovely You Inspire My Spirit on <br/>
her first letterboxing hunt in Newport for their first date. She <br/>
loves to hike and loved the idea and - well - it was match made in <br/>
heaven!  Now, it's a couple of hundred letterboxes later...and they <br/>
will wed in Barre MA at the Harding Allen Estate next Sunday on <br/>
August 29.  Isn't that just awesome!<br/>
<br/>
It occurred to me today as my hubby and I were stamping up the log <br/>
books of Together Since in Provincetown that I should let you all <br/>
know of this special occasion and give you a chance to wish them <br/>
well. Sooooo, if you would like to express well wishes to <br/>
Lonemasswolf and You Inpire My Spirit, just email it to me. I will <br/>
put your email in a basket and present it to them at their wedding. <br/>
Feel free to pass this on to your letterboxing friends. I think they <br/>
would really love this and it would be - AWESOME!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who share your enthusiasm on this forum and to <br/>
those who graciously give of your time and resources to keep the <br/>
site up and going.  You really are the reason this hobby is what it <br/>
is today.<br/>
