<div>We are happy to report that we have located our 
first letterbox in Frying Pan Park in Herndon VA!  What fun!  
Unfortunately, being really new at this, we forgot a pen or pencil to mark our 
stamps or leave a message.  So, I will leave it here:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Great clues!  The kids had a blast jumping 
over the horse jumps, rocks and crossing the stream (which did have water in it 
due to the long awaited recent rains)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One of the best things, we discovered a whole other 
part of a park we have been going to for five years!  The new playground is 
a great improvement over the old rusty "slide of death."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now we have to get going and buy some more stamps 
so we can set out our own boxes (I say buy and not carve because my kids are 
very young and the thought of them with exacto knives is truly 
scary!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks again!  
Nancy</div></body></html>
