                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am becoming increasingly disheartened over many of my boxes<br/>
turning up missing.  Some, no doubt, are due to bad hiding<br/>
places on my part, some due to people not re-covering them<br/>
well, and some just bad luck (e.g. forces of nature).  So far I<br/>
have been dutifully replacing and relocating the boxes but<br/>
I am getting tired of recarving stamps and revisiting places so<br/>
soon after planting my boxes.  Also, some boxes are too far away<br/>
to replace and I may never visit the area again.  As a solution,<br/>
I came up with the idea of providing a scanned image of the stamp<br/>
on my clue web page.  That way, if you go to the place where<br/>
my box used to be, you can print my stamp and add it to your<br/>
logbook.  Hopefully you would also send me an email with your name<br/>
and date that you visited the site so I would have a "virtual" <br/>
logbook for the box with everything except your stamp image.<br/>
Since I might never see the logbooks for some of my far off boxes,<br/>
a virtual logbook might even be better.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like to know is:  Would you still use my clues<br/>
to visit the site of a missing box if you could get an online<br/>
stamp image?<br/>
<br/>
I guess it depends on why you letterbox.  I personally like the<br/>
areas I visit as much as finding the box, so this idea appeals to<br/>
me, especially since I would never be disappointed by going to<br/>
a place and not finding the box.  This would also help keep the<br/>
boxes "immortal", since there would be no physical box to lose<br/>
or be confiscated.  You could even take it a step further and<br/>
have non-physical boxes in places where real boxes are not allowed,<br/>
like National Parks.  These would not be like the current virtual<br/>
boxes which are pure mental.  They would be more like physical-<br/>
virtual boxes, since you would still have to get outdoors and<br/>
hike to a spot to "earn" your stamp image, and the planter would<br/>
still have to carve an image and go to the place where a physical<br/>
box would have been planted.  This would also help in the "Leave No <br/>
Trace" area.<br/>
<br/>
I plan to still plant physical boxes for now, but was curious what<br/>
others think about these ideas.<br/>

<br/>
I've been thinking of virtual boxes for this instance, especially in<br/>
light of recent discussions.  I am thinking of a "Garden Walk" series,<br/>
but understandably could have difficulty getting local gardeners to<br/>
welcome an unpredictable number of people walking through the<br/>
neighborhood, let alone into their garden.  (Most of us welcome<br/>
visitors, but prefer to be asked first, and that of course would be<br/>
included in the description of the box.)  But I'm just thinking how much<br/>
safer a virtual box would be.  I would provide clues to the garden, with<br/>
a question that only someone who'd been there would know the answer to.<br/>
Then I would email them a scanned image of my stamp.  It would be<br/>
super-cool if the person had a scanned image of their stamp that they<br/>
could send us back, but of course that would be totally optional.<br/>

other restricted venues such as historical or archological sites)<br/>
<br/>
The image could be password locked so you need to give an answer that <br/>
you could only gain from having actually been to the location of <br/>
the "box"  For instance, "What is the compass bearing to Old Faithful <br/>
from the juntion of the trails?"<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I would miss is the ability to read the entries in the <br/>
log book and see the stamp images for the people who visited.<br/>
<br/>
But it seems like a nice compromise on the restricted areas issue.<br/>
<br/>
I for one would partake of such a box, but not likely to "place" one <br/>
as I am not computer savvey enough to carry it off.<br/>

Sounds like a letterboxer felt just like me and started this<br/>

Since I get more gratification from people communicating to me<br/>

I'm glad you told me about this!<br/>
