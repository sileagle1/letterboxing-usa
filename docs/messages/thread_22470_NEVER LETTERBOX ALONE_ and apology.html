My intent was to respond about letterboxing alone, and to concur with<br/>
those who advocate caution, preparedness, and commonsensical<br/>
decision-making rather than a blanket "never go alone" policy.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all the boxes i've found i've found alone, and I love the<br/>
solitary exploration and discovery of those types of hikes. I have<br/>
also foregone searching alone for boxes in places that seemed too<br/>
remote, unfamiliar, poorly-mapped, or otherwise dangerous--for<br/>
example, one box i was seeking was in a park where someone had defaced<br/>
the posted trail maps beyond readability, another was in a forest<br/>
marked with signs warning against mountain lions and coyotes. Neither<br/>
boxhunt was important enough for me to heedlessly press on despite the<br/>
risks.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to hear that the woman in question had such a terrifying and<br/>
dangerous experience, and I hope she learns from it and makes better<br/>
decisions about her next box-search, rather than simply giving up the<br/>
hobby as a result!<br/>
