them in a while. Here's what we know:<br/>
-Beavertail, at one of our all-time favorite places, is gone but re-<br/>
carved and soon to be replaced.<br/>
-Collaboration was recently reported missing, but was really still <br/>
there.<br/>
-Fort Getty and Island Sanctuary, we hope, are still alive and well.<br/>
-Fond Farewell, tho' you didn't ask specifically, is in disarray. We <br/>
think 3 of 4 are still there. Fur (of RIBNAG) graciously re-made the <br/>
stamp for the missing one but we haven't been back to set it out.<br/>
<br/>
Rhode Island, especially around Narragansett Bay, is beautiful this <br/>
time of year. Enjoy!!!<br/>

       The Beavertail Box was destroyed.  I don't know if it has been <br/>
replaced.  Fort Getty was no where to be found.  We did find Fort Wetherhill. <br/>
 Also missing High Liner and Jerusalem.  Couldn't check on Salty Brine <br/>
because there was no access to the park<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Visiting Mercy in her new home would be fine. Also, finding the <br/>
Kurdziel's 2 boxes in the Crossing Over series would be fun. I highly <br/>
recommend both, since Mercy is mine, and the other two were planted <br/>
by letterboxing friends. But don't give up on Jamestown just yet. I <br/>
just got back from the Island, and Ft. Getty is right where the <br/>
Drewclan put it a few years back. It's in need of a new box, but all <br/>
else is well with her. As it is too, with Ft. Wetherill. I placed a <br/>
few more rocks over that one to hide it a little better from those <br/>
who aren't out there letterboxing. As for the Island Sanctuary, even <br/>
if you didn't find the box, the views across the wetlands are truly <br/>
awesome. Take the hike. I'm not absolutely sure, but my guess is the <br/>
box is still out there. It did turn up once missing it's journal, <br/>
which I've replaced, but it's not a box likely to be found by <br/>
accident, so I'm guessing you're gonna find it. And even if you don't <br/>
find them, like Jay said, the Island and the views are super this <br/>
time of year. You won't come back empty handed. Let me leave you with <br/>
a few words from a man who spoke volumes during his to short time <br/>
here with us, "It's got to be the going, not the getting there that's <br/>
good". Harry Chapin<br/>
