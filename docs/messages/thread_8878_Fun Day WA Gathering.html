                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well as Ryan mentioned we did make off with the Flying Pig HH (very cool) who I think may be heading north for the winter...we also found the Traveling HH, The Addict Letterbox HH and we did not know it at the time but the New Zephyr HH which by the way is a cool stamp. <br/>
<br/>
I have to say like all others have said the event map was way cool and so was the stamp where the "X" was. We hit a lot of the boxes but not every one:(. Next time. It was a nice weekend and worth the trip.<br/>
<br/>
I did not have a chance to plant my boxes prior in enough time to print clues so hopefully some you will head back to find the Clowns. It was nice to meet the WA crew and say hello to familar faces as well.<br/>
<br/>
Til' the next time! Which by the way I am voting for BC:) as that is the only area of the Pacific NW region we have not had a gathering in...lol.<br/>
<br/>
Nice job everyone!<br/>
