&gt; *in general*, *on average*, do most of you consider a pace as 1 <br/>
&gt; footfall? <br/>
<br/>
During the Civil War, the military designated a "pace" as 28 inches. Soldiers <br/>
were expected to practice and march at 28 inch paces, 90 per minute, for a <br/>
uniform display. If you measure heel to heel (or toe to toe) while walking, a <br/>
pace should be about that length.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this is not an accepted "rule" in letterboxing as there are no <br/>
hard and fast rules but this is what my Civil War buff husband (Old Blue) has <br/>
always used when we write clues.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to try another way to attempt to measure a pace  (driving <br/>
yourself crazy in the process) try Ryan Carpenter's Applegate Rest Stop Letterbox <br/>
in Oregon!<br/>

See, therein lies part of the problem...  Not that I am advocating rules or anything like that, but simple standards.  Being a ex-military man myself, I count a pace as my normal step and my clues are listed as to what the length of my pace is.  I can't tell you the number of times that I have had to double count my steps/paces to locate a box, but that is part of the fun, no?  Again, I'm advocating standards, not rules here and feel that everyone who uses steps or paces should at the very minimum, adhere to simple standards.<br/>
<br/>
A step is a single footfall.<br/>
A pace is 2 steps.<br/>
<br/>
An average length of a step is, when hiking or marching, 2.5 feet.  At the very least, I don't see how it would detract from the no-rules feeling to give the specifics of steps vs paces and your length when writing your clues.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>
