They didn't come from "notify" like I'm used to seeing.  The messages were <br/>
friendly and seem to be legit except that they're just a little too - um - <br/>
perfect?<br/>
<br/>
I'm afraid to reply to them.<br/>

Does anyone know if this is this junk?  The last thing I need in life are <br/>
pop up ads.<br/>

What other way is there to contact someone from LbNA?  Was it mailed<br/>
through Yahoo Groups instead?  Or do you have your e-mail address<br/>
listed in your clues that are publicly available for everyone to see?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know if this is this junk?  The last thing I need in life<br/>
&gt; are pop up ads.<br/>
<br/>
What was the message about?  I'd think the content of the message<br/>
would be a pretty good clue if it's a legitimate e-mail or spam.<br/>
