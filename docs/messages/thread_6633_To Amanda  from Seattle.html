Will you PLEASE plant some in the S.F. Bay Area! And then can you <br/>
leave a couple of wings in the box for me.<br/>
<br/>
And if you are also going hunting for the New Hope Mystery box, well <br/>
this is located in an area where you wouldn't want to fly in and out <br/>
on the same day. Bring your swimsuit because the alpine lake at this <br/>
time of year is warm.<br/>
