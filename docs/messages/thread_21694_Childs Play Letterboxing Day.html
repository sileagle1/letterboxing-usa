Hi All, <br/>
I just had to share what a wonderful LB day this was. My 3 1/2 year <br/>
old son and I headed out to Alto, Texas about 10AM for the Stone Celt <br/>
Box at the Caddoan Indian Mounds.  Although the box is missing my son <br/>
declared that this place was cool and now knows what an Indian <br/>
Paintbrush flower looks like. He was totally amazed and enchanted <br/>
with this place. From there we went on to Mission Tejas.  By this <br/>
time the weather was in the mid 70's and just right.  Here we found 2 <br/>
boxes.  We toured the house and the mission and of course took a side <br/>
trip to the playground.  We then traveled on to Crockett for the Davy <br/>
Crockett letterbox.  My son also thought the water fountain attached <br/>
to the spring was great.  We then travelled on to Ratcliff Lake for <br/>
the Pack 403 box.  This spot was really great.  Our plans for the day <br/>
had been to travel from here to Lufkin, Jasper, Newton, Livingston <br/>
and Romayor but due to having so much fun with my son at all of the <br/>
wonderful places we went today we didn't make it and that was just <br/>
fine with me.  What a awesome thing it was to spend the day with my <br/>
son and not be on a time schedule at all.  We looked at frogs, found <br/>
snails, and poked around at tree stumps with sticks.  It was so <br/>
great, in fact we didn't even get home tonight until 8:30.  I am so <br/>
tired but what a wonderful day I had enjoying the great outdoors with <br/>
my son and seeing the amazement on his face with each cool thing he <br/>
encountered and learned today.  I am so thankful to Barefoot Lucy for <br/>
talking to our newspaper reporter and introducing us to <br/>
letterboxing.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">How wonderful!  My children and I had the fun of LB for the first time just <br/>
the other day.  My son is 6 and daughter 10, we headed for the LadySlipper LB <br/>
on Cape Cod, MA however due to our frustration the box wasn't there. But the <br/>
walk along the cove was so worth it!<br/>
 Then we decided to head for the other 2 I had printed out in local, old <br/>
cemetaries...One had rich town history and the other was next to a horse corral <br/>
(which is my daughters favorite activitiy of all time..)  <br/>
   We had such fun, and can you imagine that this is all free!  What a <br/>
wonderful organization.  I agree with you completely. <br/>

<br/>
I am very nw to Letterboxing, and this list, so I do not respond often.<br/>
<br/>
but your email touched me so much, what a wonderful way to start my day..... <br/>
with a warm heart.<br/>
<br/>
It is great to know how letterboxing brings families together, gets them <br/>
outside, spending time together,not stuck in front of a game box, or TV, etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have many many more special days with your son.<br/>
<br/>
tell your friends, and let the experience pass on to others.<br/>
<br/>
make a copy of your email, and keep it safe to give to your son when he is <br/>
older, if it touched strangers, think what it will mean to him. (yes I am into <br/>
genealogy also LOL)<br/>
