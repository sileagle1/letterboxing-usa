month or so before they started dying off!  They were blowing into Omaha <br/>
and actually stopping traffic.  The schools were closed for a week or <br/>
so.  Folks were asked to keep their children and small pets inside.<br/>
<br/>
One especially large one even rang my doorbell.  I tried to shut the door <br/>
right away, but he grabbed me.  I probably would have been eaten, but as he <br/>
was dragging me from my home, I realized he was only pulling my leg.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, if you had looked closely at the grasshoppers as they flitted <br/>
away from you, you would have seen that they, too, were wearing tiny little <br/>
Cornhusker caps and sweaters.<br/>

I'll add the Hopper info to the Nebraska Letterboxing website at <br/>

Thanks for passing through!<br/>

&gt;Subject: Nebraska Hopper hitchhiker<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After finding most of the letterboxes in the great state of Nebraska, and<br/>
&gt;without a single hitchhiker in any of them, I decided to create and launch<br/>
&gt;one myself. A trip to a grocery store provided the tools I needed -- an<br/>
&gt;eraser, a box cutter (the cheapest blade I could find, since I have to<br/>
&gt;throw it away before flying back east), ziploc bags, and a Mead notebook. I<br/>
&gt;then carved the Nebraska Hopper hitchhiker, commemorating the plague of<br/>
&gt;grasshoppers that are currently eating their way through the state.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I encountered the little critters every time I walked through the prairie<br/>
&gt;grass -- hundreds and hundreds of them flying and hopping out of the way<br/>
&gt;just before I landed each step. I actually think I saw more grasshoppers<br/>
&gt;than people wearing red U of N Cornhusker shirts, hats and sweatshirts on<br/>
&gt;Saturday (game day) -- though it was a close count, for sure. Let me tell<br/>
&gt;you, those Nebraskans are football crazy!<br/>
