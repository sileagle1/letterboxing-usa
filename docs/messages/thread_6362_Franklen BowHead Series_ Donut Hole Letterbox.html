inaugural letterbox to commemorate the event. More grueling than we had <br/>
planned for, the hike took us up large elevation changes, and down rocky <br/>
slopes, through fern covered forest floors and highlands, and through a <br/>
steep and barely hikeable ravine. Our original plan for the letterbox <br/>
placement was discarded due to an incompatible site. As we moved on the <br/>
trail became extremely difficult, devoid of water and campsites. So we <br/>
pushed early to the very end, thus placing the letterbox very near the <br/>
trailhead. Its a fun place though, and I hope fun clues and an entertaining <br/>
though short search. Look for the second in the series next year.<br/>

    Alvin R. Bush, a dam great site,<br/>
but the dam of the corps is for this course right.<br/>
    Find the blazed ford below this viewing stand,<br/>
after the cross, about 10 feet on clear dry land.<br/>
    Take a bearing of 140, 55 paces too?,<br/>
as the Kettle flows, so generally should you.<br/>
    A pit to ruin, from ruin to rubble,<br/>
Straight on past Linden, Hemlock, no trouble.<br/>
    Be careful reaching between, and moving stone,<br/>
this pile of rocks holds a stamp soon known.<br/>
