<br/>
I am sure some of you also dable in the art of Geocaching.  I am <br/>
taking my hiking class on a geocache hunt and need some help.  The <br/>
class is based out of Trumbull, CT and I need a SET of caches that <br/>
are along a nice trail somewhere in Southwestern CT.  I was hoping <br/>
for a really good hike with relatively easy finds that will spark <br/>
the interest of newbies.  Please let me know right away if you have <br/>
any suggestions.  I start teaching this class tonight and would love <br/>
to give them their trip info ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx- Alan (Letterboxer2002 ... aka Geocaching2002)<br/>
<br/>
p.s. - I am going to announce a mini-letterboxing gathering at <br/>
Sleeping Giant for the weekend of March 13th ... more infor to come <br/>
very soon!  :)<br/>

I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for, but you may also want to <br/>
cross post this to the Geocaching.com forums under the boards for the New <br/>
England Area.  They may be able to give you some better information.<br/>
Here's the link:<br/>

We also geocache, but we are located in Oregon.  Good luck with your search!<br/>

I do some geocaching but not in that area. There does seem to be <br/>
quite a concentration of caches in Huntington State Park near Bethel. <br/>
Check the geocaching.com site for details.<br/>
