<div> </div>
<div>The series is a lot of fun and although perhaps challenging -- it is clear if you follow the directions (we have to go back to the homework "circle the red square, underline the blue frog..." 'cause here at BeMa we obviously are having trouble following instructions!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The stamps are beautiful.  I only wish we had a color printer on this computer to print them out as handsomely as she sends them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks again Springchick!  Now, what do you know about the Froggy series?....</div>

You are most welcome...  My daughters would probably argue with you <br/>
on the patience, as it really is not one of my strong points ;-)  <br/>
But, I will have to say that I admired your perseverance and it did <br/>
help me to see a few stumbling blocks I had not considered.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations on getting all four stamps, and being the first to do <br/>
so!  Congrats also to Di from the UsualSuspects who also completed <br/>
all four over the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed it!  And sorry I can't help on the Froggy Series...<br/>

<p>Hi Jessie!  I can tell you it is not easy.  I, myself, found it in quite an a**backwards way (but that's how I seemed to do the whole series!!).  I did a lot of toying around with Google to get on the right track.  Funny thing is, my initial off the top of my head guess was right but I didn't see the link for that bench on the main page.  Who knows?  Keep trying!!  We are amazing proof that it can be done!  Springchick has also been really nice and supportive.  You might wish to drop her a line off list to bounce off some ideas.  Good luck!  BeMa<br/><br/></p></div>
