I'm heading for London on business tonight, but as no trip (domestic or international) is <br/>

Thank you and happy boxing!  :)<br/>

I am back from London safely, but regret to report that my box count<br/>
is exactly where it  was when I left.  Some of the clues made no<br/>
sense,<br/>
some were hidden in various men's  rooms (no good for solo female <br/>
me), and I got too discouraged to chase the rest.  :(   <br/>
Oh  well...I guess it just means I'll have to plan a real trip to<br/>
Dartmoor if I get serious about  international boxing.<br/>

asking you to let us know how it went b/c when I tried to find the <br/>
boxes that were in Paris on that website, I was sorely <br/>
disappointed.  They were in awful spots, almost all of which <br/>
were missing, some of which were illegal when I got there and <br/>
saw what the clue was asking, and at one of the areas I was <br/>
threatened by some scary locals in a back street.  I learned real <br/>
lessons using the urban letterboxing clues, one of the major <br/>
ones being that no box is worth risking danger to yourself when <br/>
you are all alone.  I was really quite annoyed at the stupid hiding <br/>
spots that were listed with no real redeeming value.  At least <br/>
here most of us try to plant our boxes in a spot worth getting to-or <br/>
at least make the clue worth getting there.<br/>

Sorry your experience wasn't a whole lot better!<br/>
