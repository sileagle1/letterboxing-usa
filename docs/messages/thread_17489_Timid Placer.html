This is not because a letterbox is improperly hidden ,but it is that some finders may not be as stealthy and discrete as they should be.  That being said there are several methods we have used to conceal our letterboxes. Magnets attached to a round or square Altoids tin will hold it underneath a mailbox or other steel place.  Silver duct tape matches very nicely with cement, particularly once it has weathered, and if you stick a duct tape  covered container in a crack formed by two sections of cement as in a bridge section the box will not be very visible.  Micro boxes, 35mm film canisters can be put many places that larger boxes can not. I am currently setting up a round holder that will be screwed to an under side of a wooden bench. This will hold a round letterbox container. Several letterboxers here on the Left Coast have used fake rocks that they have made. I've tried to make them but they look pretty fake. One of our older letterboxes(4/15/01) was placed just under an inside lip/corner of a planter, and I just received a note that water had gotten inside but everything inside the baggies was dry.There was nothing in particular hiding this brown duct taped container except some foliage and the planter lip.  Maybe some of these ideas will get your brain's sneaky side in gear at least I hope so as we will be traveling thru Las Vegas on our next trip north and east.<br/>
Just convert your "Timid" to "Stealth".<br/>
