         Winter gathering down in DC area sounds great. We're from Ct. but <br/>
visit family in Vienna and Leesburg often. We were planning a January trip <br/>
possibly on the weekend of the 15th. We will try to adjust for dates. We'll notify <br/>
our Va. boxing family of the proposal as well. We have 3 children that box <br/>
with us. 12, 2 1/2, and 14 mo. We broke them in on Ct. trails, so they're <br/>
trailhearty at this point. We look forward to hearing more. Happy boxing!<br/>
                                                                  Koyote of <br/>
The End Gang<br/>
