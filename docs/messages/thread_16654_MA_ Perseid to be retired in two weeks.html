<br/>
Recently, a boxer reported that the stamp at Perseid,<br/>
in Stanley Park, is starting to crack. When I first<br/>
started carving, all I could find was the Speedball<br/>
white rubber, so naturally, it's deteriorated over the<br/>
last year. <br/>
<br/>
The stamp needs to be replaced, and, with all of the<br/>
construction going on near the box, it should be moved<br/>
anyway, so Perseid is going to be officially retired<br/>
as of Nov 11, 2003, two weeks from today. If you don't<br/>
have this one and were planning on getting it, now is<br/>
your last chance. This email warning is going to be<br/>
added to the clues.<br/>
<br/>
The box will be replaced by another, similarly themed<br/>
box, sometime before the end of November.<br/>
