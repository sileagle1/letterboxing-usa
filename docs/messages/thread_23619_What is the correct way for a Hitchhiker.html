<br/>
1. There are no rules as far as having the first person to find a HH  <br/>
leave it there. Whoever finds it and has a replacement may take it  <br/>
and leave the other HH. I'm not sure I've seen another box (outside  <br/>
of hitchhiker hostels) that request a replacement, so you may just  <br/>
have to wait and see how it goes. :-)<br/>
<br/>
2+3. No trinkets. You stamp into the logbook you find and stamp the  <br/>
stamp you find into your logbook. Perhaps write a short note in the  <br/>
logbook you find and off you go in search of more boxes! Every once  <br/>
in a while you may find a trinket left for the First Finder of a box,  <br/>
but if you are the FF, you'd take that with you and not leave  <br/>
anything in its place - it's more of a prize/souvenir than a caching- <br/>
style trinket.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would have to agree with Maiden on this.  Although you can place any stipulation on your HH that you want to, standard practice is to pick up any HH that is in a box you find and that is how most people are accustomed to playing the game.  There are specific boxes, known as HH Hostels, that require the finder to leave a HH if they take a HH, but for a regular box, most people are accustomed to picking up any HH they find.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure where you noted the restriction that the HH can only be taken if another one is left, but if this is simply noted in the HH logbook, that may not be enough.  I for one, do not generally even open a HH bag/box when I pick it up, rather just put it in my pack and take it home with me at which time I leisurely browse through the book and do the stamp exchange.  In a situation like that, I would never have seen your request that I leave another HH in return.<br/>
<br/>
It is certainly your option to place such a restriction on your box and the HH's contained therein, but you have to realize that people won't be expecting that and may not realize that is what they are supposed to do.  It may help to make this note in the box clues themself.  Or maybe since this box follows the practice of a HH Hostel, you could just make it a HH Hostel, in which case people would look for the box with the understanding this is what they are supposed to do. <br/>

  In defense of the person that may or may not have "kidnapped" your first HH,<br/>
  it is not standard practice to "trade" HH's. Usually if you find a HH, you<br/>
  take it with you and move it along, not trade another one for it. <br/>

I usually do the three way stamp on site but I'm very picky where I leave a HH. If I determine that the potential host box is in a poor location, I skip it and I tend to take the HH across the county or state to speed the journey cross country. <br/>
<br/>
 Taking HH to boxes where newbies are less likely to find it helps to insure the safety of the HH until folks have gained the experience to treat them properly. I was showing a new fellow a HH and he said he never found one yet so I pointed out where he had indeed stamped into the HH log. He didn't stamp the host box log because he didn't realize he held a HH.<br/>

     I would have to agree with Maiden on this. Although you can place any stipulation on your HH that you want to, standard practice is to pick up any HH that is in a box you find and that is how most people are accustomed to playing the game. There are specific boxes, known as HH Hostels, that require the finder to leave a HH if they take a HH, but for a regular box, most people are accustomed to picking up any HH they find.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not sure where you noted the restriction that the HH can only be taken if another one is left, but if this is simply noted in the HH logbook, that may not be enough. I for one, do not generally even open a HH bag/box when I pick it up, rather just put it in my pack and take it home with me at which time I leisurely browse through the book and do the stamp exchange. In a situation like that, I would never have seen your request that I leave another HH in return.<br/>
<br/>
 It is certainly your option to place such a restriction on your box and the HH's contained therein, but you have to realize that people won't be expecting that and may not realize that is what they are supposed to do. It may help to make this note in the box clues themself. Or maybe since this box follows the practice of a HH Hostel, you could just make it a HH Hostel, in which case people would look for the box with the understanding this is what they are supposed to do. <br/>

 In defense of the person that may or may not have "kidnapped" your first HH,<br/>
 it is not standard practice to "trade" HH's. Usually if you find a HH, you<br/>
 take it with you and move it along, not trade another one for it. <br/>
