series today.  We had trouble finding the first box in the series, <br/>
I'm not going to try to spell the name of the falls.  We had gone a <br/>
little too far down the trail the first time.  The shad flies were <br/>
just as bad but we were a little fresher.  We then took on the Fab <br/>
Four, really five boxes.  I grew up on one of the roads boardering <br/>
the park and spent many, many hours hiking the Canfield woods section <br/>
of the park, it was fun seeing the old forest 25 or 30 years later.  <br/>
The first two boxes, the ones in the Deep River section hadn't been <br/>
stamped in since last Nov., the Canfield three were visited in April, <br/>
all were in very good to excellent condition.<br/>
