No, we've been wondering the same thing.  We haven't heard from him <br/>
in about 9/29/3.  We've been concerned but we also know that he's <br/>
most likely very busy.  Any word would be most welcome.<br/>

The last note I received from him was on 10/13.<br/>
But I do have some background info. My brother-in-law Keith is also in Iraq and the last we heard his camp in getting hit with mortor fire 20 times a day. This has caused the communication lines to be knocked out. Also I don't know about the camp Kris is in but the where Keith is they are not allowing communication lines meaning email and phone lines are now supposed to use for official use not personal. They are hoping this will be better by January possibly December.<br/>
The best we can do is send out our thoughts and prayers to these men and women. <br/>

I don't think so because he signed the note to me "Kristoffer"<br/>
