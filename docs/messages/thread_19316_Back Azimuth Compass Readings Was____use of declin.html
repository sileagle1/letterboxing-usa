How many of you have planted or found a box using "Back Azimuth?" <br/>
JugglerMouse has one of her Redwall series that is found that way. <br/>
That will show ME for teaching her about Back Azimuth. <br/>
<br/>
You still puzzled? Imagine if you will that the clues say that a box <br/>
sees landmark 1 at 25 degrees and sees landmark 2 at 289 degrees. How <br/>
would you find the box?<br/>
<br/>
1. Go to Landmark 1<br/>
2. Add 180 degrees to the 25 degrees, that gives you the heading of <br/>
205 degress (SSW, right?) <br/>
3. Walk along that line until landmark 2 lines up with 289 degrees.<br/>
4. You should be standing on it!<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
Repeat steps one and two above<br/>
3. Have a friend go to landmark 2<br/>
4. 289 - 180 (because the azimuth is bigger than 180 degrees) to get <br/>
the heading of 109.<br/>
5. Have the friend sight along 109 degrees and yell STOP at you while <br/>
you are marching down your 205 degree heading when you hit their 109 <br/>
degree sighting.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, whichever way you choose, you should see landmark 1 <br/>
now at 25 degrees and landmark 2 at 289. Now start searching.<br/>
<br/>
One small caveat: if the landmarks are metal, like flagpoles, step a <br/>
few feet away from them before shooting any compass readings. A duh <br/>
that I sometimes forget.<br/>

<br/>
Have Person 1 go to Landmark A and take a reading of, say, 45 degrees.  Have Person 2 go to Landmark B and shoot an azimuth of 136 degrees.  Where they intersect is the box.  Teamwork!<br/>

Look at Sassafras Pond LB (Schuyler) NY, for instance.  It's also <br/>

I always try to look at a map, preferably a topographic map, before going to look for a box in an area I don't know well.  The map can be a good indicator of what kind of terrain to expect when you get there.  I have also been able to follow the clues on a map and have a pretty good idea of where the box is before I get to it.<br/>
<br/>
I purchased the National Geographic Topo! map program for California and <br/>
just finished marking the approximate location (or starting point if I couldn't determine the box's location) for all the letterboxes in LA and Orange Counties.  This has proven to be very helpful in planning boxing trips as I can see all the boxes in a geographic area without having to stop and think if that letterbox in San Marino is near Pasadena or is somewhere in the San Fernando Valley.<br/>

&gt; ew feet away from them before shooting any compass readings. A duh<br/>
&gt; that I sometimes forget.<br/>
<br/>
Especially fire hydrants!  Those iron monsters would have you walking in circles if you tried to follow the needle without looking up.<br/>

How devious!  Dang you for making us learn new things!!  Don and Gwen did this to us with the Stamp Golf series in Long Beach!  (Of course, who am I to talk since I am thinking about a series having to do with Astronomical Units [AU]). &gt;:)<br/>
