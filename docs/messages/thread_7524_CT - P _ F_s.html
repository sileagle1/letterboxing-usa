them in the car...and at least they were in the car rather than back at<br/>
my apartment like we thought ;o)  Besides, the up side was finding the<br/>
"short-cut" to the second location so we didnt' have to walk so far -<br/>
even if we still couldn't find that silly box in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of the "mishaps", it is always a great adventure.  I have<br/>
found so many great new places to explore - and it is the hunt, and<br/>
spending time with a best friend, that I find so thrilling.  Even if<br/>
all the boxes you look for in a day turn out to be missing - or so well<br/>
hidden you can't for the life of you find them ;oP.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp - hand carved, store-bought, detailed or "primitive" (as many<br/>
of my attempts have been) doesn't matter.  It is just creates a nice<br/>
reason to go and explore.  I like having a reason to go check out<br/>
someplace - a purpose for going.  Letterboxing has created that for me<br/>
and allowed me to explore areas - near and far - that I never would<br/>
have just gone down to "explore".  The stamp is also just such a great<br/>
way to have an everlasting, tangible, memory of the day.  <br/>
<br/>
I love to look through my journal, see a stamp - or entry of a failed<br/>
attempt - and have it trigger memories of the chase.  Whether those<br/>
memories are of driving from one end of the state to the other to see<br/>
how many boxes we can fit in during the limited time we have together,<br/>
or not being able to get onto a tree swing and having tears running<br/>
down your face from the laughter as your best friend forever preserves<br/>
the craziness with a picture, or even of spending hours trying to<br/>
figure out a difficult clue and being rewarded by actually finding the<br/>
box in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing, for me, has created a great way for my best friend and I<br/>
to get out, laugh, relax, enjoy each other's company, and have a blast.<br/>
 And for that, I am thankful for having had her introduce me to this<br/>
great hobby.<br/>

<br/>How about when you go to a site with multiple boxes placed by different people, but don't realize it till you get back to the car to plan where to head next?

<br/>I've added a '"V" to our short hand for virtual boxes. We feel that virtual boxes are unique enough that they deserve a separate category.

<br/>
<br/>We've planted three boxes so far that have carved stamps, and three store bought ones. One of the store bought stamps was to commemerate my wife's parents wedding, and another was too cool to pass on. The last one was meant to go in Maine at a favorite fishing spot, but we ran out of time due to injury. I think all three of the store stamps are appropriate for the box, and, as you said, it gives folks a reason to go to places they never would have otherwise. 
<br/>
<br/>We haven't been doing this very long, but I'm happy to know that, for the newbies around here that come along, there are now more boxes for them to find, and for the veterans, there are now more boxes for them to find. :-)
<br/>
<br/>It's all good!

geocaches as Finds. So there, The End.<br/>
