What a pleasant walk we had enjoying the wildflowers along the trail.  <br/>
The bank of nastursiums (sp?) evoked childhood memories of home.  <br/>
...took a photo op at the rope swing and survived!  ...spoke with two <br/>
young boys performing "jumps" on their bikes at the lower portion of <br/>
the trail.  ...found the box intact and in good condition.  Finding a <br/>
plastic bag, we decided to pick up trash on the way back to the car.  <br/>
...an added bonus--I found a blue-striped marble and Hubby found a <br/>
dollar bill!!  Thank you...we enjoyed finding this box!   ...H&amp;S--<br/>
