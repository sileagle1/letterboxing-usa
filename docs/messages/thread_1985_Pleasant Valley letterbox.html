                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went hunting for the two Pleasant Valley letterboxes in Lyme, CT <br/>
this past Sunday.  I just wanted to point out that the street sign <br/>
for MacIntosh road seems to be missing -- I only found it by making <br/>
an educated guess.  If anybody out there is planning to do this one, <br/>
look for Beaver Brook Road on the other side of Route 156.  The road <br/>
opposite Beaver Brook Road is MacIntosh Road.  <br/>
<br/>
That said, this was a great way to spend a few hours -- although I <br/>
was rushing against sunset to find the second letterbox.  My hands <br/>
were numb as I rushed to stamp up and head back down the trail so I <br/>
would have enough light to get back!  I suppose I should have <br/>
budgeted a little more time to find them.  I suppose it's a good idea <br/>
to bring a small flashlight with you when letterboxing, just in case <br/>
you get lost and it gets dark.<br/>
<br/>
So I can now say with pride that I am P2F7.  Nowhere near some <br/>
others, but I think I'm safely out of the beginner stage.<br/>
