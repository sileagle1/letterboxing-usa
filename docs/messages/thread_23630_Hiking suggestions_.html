  My 2 cents:  bring water, your LB supplies, maybe even an extra baggie for repairs, and if ANY poison oak or tics possiblity in your area, wear long pants and shoes. I went on a spur of the moment in shorts and sandals since easy trail, but now have poison oak up and down legs and feet.....itch...itch...<br/>

Lucy, that's too funny. I usually carry some money too. I never knew why I thought I might need it on a trail - bail money for trespassing maybe? Once when I was loading up my pack and realized I had no cash, I put in my Visa card! Surely those squirrels take Visa!<br/>

It's my experience in my area that folks seldom plant a box more than a mile from a car and won't visit those that are much beyond that especially if it's on a hilltop so the idea of a massive pack may not be needed. I've seen folks with a 'pack' that fits easily into a pocket.<br/>
<br/>
 I have a twin bottle Wal-mart fanny pack that I use and only have the needed LB items inside. I started in March and had the chance to see how season changes affect how boxes are visible in the spring as opposed to full plant growth. <br/>

     Hi, being a newb to letterboxing and hiking, both, I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for hiking?<br/>
<br/>
 Such as, what do you bring with you? Backpack? Snacks, water, etc? What do you normally carry in your pack?<br/>
<br/>
 What kind of clothing is suggested? Shorts? Pants? Sneakers, hiking boots?<br/>
<br/>
 I realize it's all individual, however, I'm one of those people who like to see what others do, then pick and choose what might work for me.<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks for any suggestions, or BTDTs<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, I'm really surprised that no one said pants because it helps protect<br/>
against ticks (should also wear long sleeve shirt, too, theoretically).<br/>
Read a few articles about the kind of damage ticks can do to you and pants<br/>
really don't seem so bad.  I wear wicking pants that can convert to shorts<br/>
if I really, really need to, but I haven't done it once.  The wicking part<br/>
works pretty good!  The actual retrieving of a box often involves a little<br/>
off-trail where you are probably most likely to get a tick; stamping in also<br/>
gets you some good nature contact-time, too.<br/>
<br/>
Water, water, water.  If you are hiking for a few hours you cannot carry the<br/>
amount of water you need in a fanny pack, particularly at this time of<br/>
year.  Not drinking enough can be very dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
Hiking boots - can't recommend them enough for ankle support.  Don't go for<br/>
inexpensive.  Miserable feet = miserable hiker.  Boots should provide ankle<br/>
support, have sturdy soles, be waterproof and breath (read: goretex).<br/>
<br/>
Trekking poles - if you are really hiking, I can't recommend these enough,<br/>
either.  They help your knees and are good for balance if you have to cross<br/>
a stream or walk along a rocky trail or climb up or down something steep.<br/>
Plus previously mentioned bonuses of being able to use them to fight off<br/>
spider webs and poke into letterbox hiding spots.  Can also use to poke your<br/>
partner to move faster or for impromptu reenactment of the sword fight atop<br/>
the Cliffs of Insanity.<br/>
<br/>
Flashlight - underestimate the distance to that last box at the end of the<br/>
day just once and you will carry a flashlight or headlamp with you.  No need<br/>
for you to find out the hard way.<br/>
<br/>
Map<br/>
Compass<br/>
Whistle<br/>
First aid kit<br/>
Snacks<br/>
Cell phone (never count on a cell phone working, but if there was an<br/>
emergency and it did have reception, you'd be glad to have it)<br/>
<br/>
So obviously I carry a backpack.  Oh yeah, letterboxing stuff goes in there,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
And that's just the summer list.<br/>
<br/>
You thought hiking was a free activity until you read this!  Of course many<br/>
people seem to survive without all this, so there is something to be said<br/>
there.  Green Tortuga, what did you carry on the AT?!  :-)<br/>
Regardless, if you need to actually buy a bunch of stuff, e-mail me and I<br/>
will give you some advice on where to shop.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi, being a newb to letterboxing and hiking, both, I was wondering if<br/>
&gt; anyone had suggestions for hiking?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Such as, what do you bring with you? Backpack? Snacks, water, etc? What do<br/>
&gt; you normally carry in your pack?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What kind of clothing is suggested? Shorts? Pants? Sneakers, hiking boots?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realize it's all individual, however, I'm one of those people who like<br/>
&gt; to see what others do, then pick and choose what might work for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for any suggestions, or BTDTs<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ryan's description of getting rid of stuff along the way reminds me of a<br/>
book my husband is reading - The Ultralight Backpacker.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, Fearless Fox, is one who, when he goes camping, thinks up every<br/>
possible thing in the world to take.  We often find ourselves taking more<br/>
than one vehicle because we HAVE to take so much stuff.  I, on the other<br/>
hand, am a minimalist (and sometimes too much so).<br/>
<br/>
When he started doing longer overnight hikes, he followed his normal habit<br/>
of packing everything he could possibly ever need, I guess in the event they<br/>
got lost on the trail and an earthquake struck while they were lost and<br/>
created a huge divide on both sides of them that separated them for eternity<br/>
from the rest of civilization - that was all I could ever figure out<br/>
anyway.  He packed for days when he and his friend each took their sons to<br/>
Arkansas to hike.  They were planning on being on the trail for 2 nights<br/>
and 3 days.  He would pack up and then put his backpack on and we would do<br/>
our normal walk at night.  Satisfied he could handle it, he would shove more<br/>
in and we would repeat the walk the next night.  Finally, the day came for<br/>
them to leave.  The four of them loaded up and headed off.  Drove eight<br/>
hours and then headed out to make their food drops.  After they finished, he<br/>
called me at home (eight hours away) and told me "I have a little problem".<br/>
Being married to him for 20+ years and knowing him very well, my first<br/>
comment was "There is NO WAY IN H... I am bringing you ANYTHING."  He said,<br/>
"These mountains are STRAIGHT up!"  I guess I should mention that our<br/>
neighborhood is pretty much flat - total rise of perhaps 8 feet if you go<br/>
down one particular street.<br/>
<br/>
He and his partner spent the next several hours dumping their backpacks on<br/>
the beds of hotel they were staying in before they began their journey (I<br/>
have no idea how long his buddy spent packing, but as I said, Fearless Fox's<br/>
packing took several nights), and whittling down what they absolutely had to<br/>
have.  They managed to up the boy's backpacks to 9 and 13 pounds, and get<br/>
their own down to about 40 pounds.  Even still, they realized after they<br/>
started out that they had toooo much!  They managed it though, and even<br/>
though they didn't walk as far as they had hoped (they were shooting for 28<br/>
miles, and they made 21), they survived with no earthquakes or anything<br/>
other than some healthy blisters.<br/>
<br/>
And so he began to read The Ultralight Backpacker.  The author of that book<br/>
- now he is a fanatic about packing light.  He even suggests that you take<br/>
your toothbrush and saw the handle down, then drill holes in the remaining<br/>
handle to lighten it.  I'm gonna be really surprised to see Fearless Fox get<br/>
to that point, but it's fun watching him think about it!<br/>

long time packing, confident in my living room that the weight was good.<br/>
About 10 minutes in on the hike I started to have my doubts.  Let's just say<br/>
when I got home, I weighed everything - everything! - in my pack.  "WHAT?!?<br/>
This camera weighs a pound?!"<br/>
<br/>
Next time I was much more practical - no more "Saturday outfit, Sunday<br/>
outfit, Monday outfit" for me!  That trip was a LOT more enjoyable!  But I<br/>
watched someone else in the group struggling, and was quite surprised - he<br/>
seemed like he was in good shape.  When we stopped for a snack he pulled out<br/>
a JAR of peanut butter!  Later at camp, he pulled out quite a few more<br/>
things like that - including a jar of tabasco sauce.  I think I know what<br/>
his problem was...<br/>

          Ryan's description of getting rid of stuff along the way reminds me of a<br/>
book my husband is reading - The Ultralight Backpacker.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, Fearless Fox, is one who, when he goes camping, thinks up every<br/>
possible thing in the world to take. We often find ourselves taking more<br/>
than one vehicle because we HAVE to take so much stuff. I, on the other<br/>
hand, am a minimalist (and sometimes too much so).<br/>
<br/>
When he started doing longer overnight hikes, he followed his normal habit<br/>
of packing everything he could possibly ever need, I guess in the event they<br/>
got lost on the trail and an earthquake struck while they were lost and<br/>
created a huge divide on both sides of them that separated them for eternity<br/>
from the rest of civilization - that was all I could ever figure out<br/>
anyway. He packed for days when he and his friend each took their sons to<br/>
Arkansas to hike. They were planning on being on the trail for 2 nights<br/>
and 3 days. He would pack up and then put his backpack on and we would do<br/>
our normal walk at night. Satisfied he could handle it, he would shove more<br/>
in and we would repeat the walk the next night. Finally, the day came for<br/>
them to leave. The four of them loaded up and headed off. Drove eight<br/>
hours and then headed out to make their food drops. After they finished, he<br/>
called me at home (eight hours away) and told me "I have a little problem".<br/>
Being married to him for 20+ years and knowing him very well, my first<br/>
comment was "There is NO WAY IN H... I am bringing you ANYTHING." He said,<br/>
"These mountains are STRAIGHT up!" I guess I should mention that our<br/>
neighborhood is pretty much flat - total rise of perhaps 8 feet if you go<br/>
down one particular street.<br/>
<br/>
He and his partner spent the next several hours dumping their backpacks on<br/>
the beds of hotel they were staying in before they began their journey (I<br/>
have no idea how long his buddy spent packing, but as I said, Fearless Fox's<br/>
packing took several nights), and whittling down what they absolutely had to<br/>
have. They managed to up the boy's backpacks to 9 and 13 pounds, and get<br/>
their own down to about 40 pounds. Even still, they realized after they<br/>
started out that they had toooo much! They managed it though, and even<br/>
though they didn't walk as far as they had hoped (they were shooting for 28<br/>
miles, and they made 21), they survived with no earthquakes or anything<br/>
other than some healthy blisters.<br/>
<br/>
And so he began to read The Ultralight Backpacker. The author of that book<br/>
- now he is a fanatic about packing light. He even suggests that you take<br/>
your toothbrush and saw the handle down, then drill holes in the remaining<br/>
handle to lighten it. I'm gonna be really surprised to see Fearless Fox get<br/>
to that point, but it's fun watching him think about it!<br/>

After just a few days? hours? Katz falls far behind. Bryson has to go back and find him. When he reaches Katz he finds out that Katz unloaded a lot of wieight to lighten his load.Something like this:<br/>
<br/>
  Bryson - "Where's the matches"<br/>
  Katz - "Flung"<br/>
  Bryson - "Ane the spam?"<br/>
  Katz - "Really flung!"<br/>
  Bryson - "Coffee filters?"<br/>
  Katz - 'Flung!"<br/>
  Bryson - "You flung the coffee filters?"<br/>

I thought what they were doing were normal m.o. They had frozen meat that thawed by day 2 or 3, syrup for pancakes, and even a beer for day 5. My friend and I were eating the standard dried soups and other dehydrated foods....were we jealous!  except for our backs faired better... makings for good stories many years later.  Now I know better....give all the heavy stuff to teenage boys and carry the fluffy down that looks like I have a lot. lol ...they still beat me to the end.<br/>

And if you also get the audio version of "Neither Here Nor There," you <br/>
can also hear Bryson talk (albeit briefly) about his previous trip <br/>
with Katz through Europe. Also hilarious.<br/>

This was a fellow who first walked the length of the Grand Canyon down inside 'The man who walked through time'. He also wrote the 1000 mile Summer about walking the length of California into Baja. I believe he did many of these feats in the 50's and 60's.<br/>
