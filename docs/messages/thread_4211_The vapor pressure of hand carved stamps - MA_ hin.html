                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Yes, with stamps it is not "safety in numbers", but <br/>
rather "safety in LOW numbers".  In a recent post I stated:<br/>
<br/>
"These are my early boxes with store stamps. They will get harder <br/>
when I carve my own."<br/>
<br/>
In that vein, I have uploaded a hint about my next box, Dreamery, <br/>
into the list photo area:<br/>
<br/>
http://photos.groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/lst<br/>
<br/>
The final clue list, after the box is actually planted, will be this <br/>
map plus one other clue.  The difficulty will be medium, as the stamp <br/>
is still store bought, but one I am fond of.<br/>

&gt; Ill advisedly*, I have the following to say:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *We had a meeting - me, myself, and I - and I was the only one that <br/>
&gt; thought I should write this.  So I'm writing it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The simple fact is that stamps disappear.  Of the 56 boxes I have <br/>
put <br/>
&gt; stamps in, two of the stamps have disappeared - so far - 3 months.  <br/>
&gt; Eleven of the total stamps are actually in geocaches.  One stamp <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; definitely stolen by a non-letterboxer.  The rascal left the box, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; the log, but took the stamp.  From what I can gather it was one of <br/>
&gt; the Procyon lotor, a group of notorious stamp stealers.  I believed <br/>
&gt; all precautions had been taken, but the odor of the box apparently <br/>
&gt; led to its discovery.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another stamp was discovered to be missing - uh, not discovered to <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; present - in a hybrid geocache/letterbox.  No note was made in the <br/>
&gt; log about taking the stamp, either in the box or on the web.  A <br/>
&gt; search of the ground around the box found no accidentally dropped <br/>
&gt; stamp.  The ammobox had none of the puncture marks usually left as <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; calling card by the Procyon lotor clan.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was left with no other reasonable explanation other than - like a <br/>
&gt; drop of water on a summer sun heated rock - the vapor pressure got <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; it. <br/>

&gt; *******************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In our web letterboxing web pages we have made sure that those <br/>
&gt; looking for letterboxes know:  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER:  Letterboxing, like any <br/>
&gt; outdoor sport, carries the risk of unforeseen hazards... <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You know the rest by heart. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it may be about time we included another WORAD:  It could <br/>
go <br/>
&gt; something like this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER:  <br/>
&gt; Leaving letterboxes out for others to find is a usually enjoyable <br/>
&gt; activity albeit with several known risks and it likely has other <br/>
&gt; risks less well understood - what doesn't?  <br/>
&gt; -There is a small risk that the enjoyment of creating, writing, and <br/>
&gt; placing the letterbox and its associated clues will not offset the <br/>
&gt; expense or trouble expended in creating the box, stamp, and clues.  <br/>
&gt; This risk benefit ratio - as experienced by the letterboxer may <br/>
&gt; change from time to time.  <br/>
&gt; -IMPORTANT: There is a risk that your box may not be found for a <br/>
very <br/>
&gt; long time, a time which can extend to the environs of infinity. (A) <br/>
&gt; -IMPORTANT: There is a risk that the box, or a portion of its <br/>
&gt; contents, may be stolen, borrowed, photographed, replaced with a <br/>
key <br/>
&gt; chain, or simply evaporate.  This experience may be irritating to <br/>
&gt; painful, may cause lost sleep, additional expense, may occasion new <br/>
&gt; creative efforts, and require additional hiking and driving time <br/>
&gt; while further wearing down your boots, tires and suspension. (B)<br/>
&gt; -It is well understood that the more likely you design your clues <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; the physical placement of the box to attract and engage others in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; actual finding of the box, the more likely it is that the previous <br/>
&gt; set of risks (B) will transpire, but this approach will limit risk <br/>
&gt; set (A).<br/>
&gt; -It can never be best understood by more than one letterboxer - how <br/>
&gt; to make boxes which maintain high appeal while engendering only <br/>
&gt; minimal risk of ever being discovered by more than a half of a <br/>
&gt; handful of individuals.<br/>

now <br/>
