Lacey<br/>
Thurston County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
Level of difficulty: Level paved trail-slight slope near the <br/>
letterbox.  Clues easy to moderate.<br/>
<br/>
Setting:  Chehalis Western Trailpaved trail (currently 7 miles <br/>
long) along historic Weyerhaeuser-owned Chehalis Western Railroad.  <br/>
When completed, the 22-mile trail will eventually link Woodard Bay <br/>
in the North to the Yelm-Tenino Trail (itself 14.5-miles in length) <br/>
in the South.  This trail will traverse a variety of ecosystems and <br/>
environments in both urban and rural areas of Thurston County, <br/>
provide access to over 170-acres of park land including over 2 miles <br/>
of Deschutes River frontage. <br/>
<br/>
Highlights:  The entire trail will provide access to Puget Sound, <br/>
Chambers Lake, Deschutes River, wetlands, forests, farmland, creeks, <br/>
prairies and other habitats.  This particular letterbox trek will <br/>
take you through the Chambers Lake region of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Facilities:  Bathrooms, picnic tables &amp; water fountains open <br/>
seasonally. Open until dusk. <br/>
<br/>
Restrictions: Bicycles, in-line skates, pedestrians &amp; pets allowed.  <br/>
Leash and scoop laws in effect for pets. <br/>
<br/>
Length of trek:  2-4 miles roundtrip (depending upon which trailhead <br/>
you choose)<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Directions to Chambers Lake Trailhead: (from I-5 north <br/>
and south bound)  Take exit #108 (Sleater Kinney Road) and head <br/>
south.  Cross Pacific Avenue.  At the 4-way stop sign, turn right <br/>
onto 14th Avenue.  Follow approximately 1/2 mile.  The entrance is <br/>
after the trestle on the left.  Restroom, parking, and picnic areas <br/>
are available.  (2 miles roundtriphead South)<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the 67th Avenue Trailhead:<br/>
Take Exit #109 (College Street) and travel south.  Cross Pacific <br/>
Avenue and Yelm Highway.  College Street becomes Rainier Road.  <br/>
Follow approximately one (1) mile.  Turn right onto 67th Avenue and <br/>
follow to the end.  No restroom facility. (4 miles roundtrip-head <br/>
North)<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  From either the Chambers Lake Trailhead or the 67th Avenue <br/>
Trailheadcontinue to mile marker 8.  Find the Rotary Overlook <br/>
nearby.  Like a book on a Northern shelf, hidden under the deck in a <br/>
southerly manner, perches a happy little goldfish.  <br/>
<br/>
Please ensure the box is closed tightly and well hidden (label side <br/>
in) when you're finished.<br/>
