The stamp for this box was originally carved by Funhog but never got <br/>
hidden for some reason.  She gave the stamp to Amanda (from Seattle!) <br/>
to hide, which was done today (under my strict supervision, of course <br/>
*smile*).  Amanda wrote up the clues (again, under strict <br/>
supervision), and I've been charged with posting the clue for <br/>
everyone to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
So enjoy it, darn it!  =)<br/>
