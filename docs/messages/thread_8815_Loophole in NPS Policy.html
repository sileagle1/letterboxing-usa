Thank you!   I was thinking this very same thing when I saw the email on this issue.  If you just talk to the NPS staff and find out what the policy is there shouldn't be any problem with placing a letterbox.  The NPS is happy for anything that gets people out in the parks but they are religiously fanatic about anything they might consider litter or harmful - ie; was someone stupid enough to place a box in fragile habitat in such a way that it interferes with nesting birds or other wildlife or will dangerously increase traffic in a fragile area or an area frequented by bears, etc?  It's always a good idea to ask and then they're cool on it, they know what it is and won't throw it away. </body></html>

    I went to the site and quess what National Park is featured! Yep, <br/>
The C &amp; O Canal. A National Park is covered by a National Park Ranger <br/>
and they are "Policing Officials" and they carry guns. They are not <br/>
rent-a-cops. So as far as I'm concerned, The C&amp;O Canal covers approx. <br/>
185 miles, is designated as a National Park. (Along with 90%of all <br/>
Parks in the Washington,DC area.) You can camp, fish, go boating , <br/>
hike, bike etc. just like any large western USA National Park.  <br/>
   Looks like a duck, smells like a duck, controlled by a Big duck - <br/>
must be a DUCK! <br/>

just spoke to a park ranger in NM last week regarding letterboxing. He immediately pulled out a mini sized <br/>
version of NP regulations and read me the two lines that 1) forbids leaving anything in a NP and 2) forbids <br/>
leaving anything unattended for longer than 24 hours. He also told me that the Park Service test for any <br/>
approving any activity in the park is asking if said activity can be done elsewhere. With letterboxing he <br/>
felt we should take it elsewhere. <br/>
<br/>
I also suggested that perhaps a box could be placed in the visitor center sort of along the lines of the <br/>
passport stamp program. He acquiesced and said that that might be something that could maybe, <br/>
possibly, someday be done. He then suggested that the best way for us to get letterboxing approved is to <br/>
get a bill through Congress... So my final analysis is that it'll probably be allowed when donuts fly. Funhog<br/>

Hee hee, nice try.  It's a National HISTORIC Park.  If you are in the <br/>
DC area, then an actual NP near you would be Shenandoah.  Go there, &amp; <br/>
if you are successful in securing permission, you shall have your <br/>

I'd love to have someone prove me wrong, but I'm not holding my <br/>

Sure, I don't like it either that the NPS doesn't see it from our <br/>
perspective as there are some fantastic letterbox spots to be had in <br/>
National Park areas in Michigan, but they have communicated their <br/>
stance.  Although I see nothing wrong with walking in with a box and <br/>
asking permission to place it in the park (as stated in their <br/>
policy), I think we need to be careful not to appear as renegades by <br/>
blatantly disregarding their policy.<br/>

There are lots of other places to plant boxes and many other groups <br/>
