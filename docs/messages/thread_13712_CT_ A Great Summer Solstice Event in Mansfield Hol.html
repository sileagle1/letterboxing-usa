                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone!  I just wanted to thank Leader of the Pack for a great Summer <br/>
Solstice gather today!  The rain stayed away long enough for most of the <br/>
gather.  Thank goodness!  <br/>
<br/>
It was so nice to see so many new faces today!  We even had Preach's niece <br/>
from Norfolk VA (Hands and Feet) today!  I hope she can stay a while and get in <br/>
some plentiful boxing here in CT before heading back to VA!<br/>
<br/>
Many hitchhikers made it to the event, including the Red Hand, Marshmallow, <br/>
Dirty Bird (what that what it was called??), Time Flies, and Butterfly's new <br/>
hitchhiker, Walking Stick.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to Preach and Needeeps who were nice to go out to the Jumble <br/>
Series loop and find Butterfly's walking stick last weekend.  Today, they almost <br/>
tried to give her back a different, less ornate stick, but she wouldn't fall <br/>
for the trick!  Good try though!<br/>
<br/>
After the gather, Butterfly and I went on Safari to the North.  As soon as we <br/>
got to the car, it started to pour, so we called it a day.  I then decided to <br/>
go and get the Grandstand LB in Willimantic, since I was in the area while <br/>
the museum was actually open!<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great day!  Thanks to everyone who came! <br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was great to see you again Music Woman,as well as other famous and <br/>
familiar letterboxers here in CT. An event stamp was carved by our <br/>
devoted Leader of the Pack, the Kettle Hole series (not posted) was <br/>
explored from #1 to #17 by a bunch of us. I met a woman who works in <br/>
the same town school system I used to, plus a graduate of my  alma <br/>
mater high school.  I wish Hands and Feet all the best upon the <br/>
upcoming birth of her daughter in early August.<br/>
   Long live the hobby of letterboxing! <br/>
