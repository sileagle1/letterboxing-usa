I'm extremely embarassed that I said, in a public newsgroup, that I <br/>
was the first stamp in "The Real 49er" letterbox when now I know that <br/>
this claim is wrong.  At the time of my visit, I realized that the <br/>
two older Don &amp; Gwen LBs at Long Beach State had newer stamp books, <br/>
but I just assumed the stamp book in the much younger, "The Real <br/>
49er," was original.  I believe I wrote about my misgivings in the <br/>
box's stamp book--something like, "...if this stamp book hasn't been <br/>
replaced, I'm the first stamp...," or some such.  As of July 5, 2003, <br/>
there was a new stamp book in this letterbox, with no previous stamps-<br/>
-and I just assumed it was the original stamp book. I hope this sets <br/>
the record straight for all the letterboxers who found this box <br/>
before me.  It was a fantastic letterboxing day, thanks!  (Sometimes <br/>
in my posts, I've emphasized being the first stamp, but this isn't <br/>
football--we don't have to WIN at all costs; it's just fun being out <br/>
of the house, and discovering new places we'd never have discovered <br/>
otherwise, such as El Dorado Park, or the Arroyo Pescadero Trail."<br/>

&gt; &gt; As for your newer (planted 10/29/02) Cal State letterbox, "The <br/>
Real <br/>
&gt; &gt; 49er," I'm proud to say that after more than 9 months planted, <br/>
I'm <br/>
&gt; &gt; the first stamp.  The clue to this one is very tricky, but that <br/>
&gt; makes <br/>
&gt; &gt; it all the more fun to find.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Buzzard,<br/>
&gt; I hope that someone has not taken some pages out of "The Real 49er" <br/>
&gt; log book. When Jelly and I found it it in May it had a couple of <br/>
&gt; LBers who had found it before us?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hey have you checked out California Bears new group for So.Cal <br/>
boxers?<br/>
&gt; Check back in recent threads he has the link in a past post.<br/>
&gt; We have had a hard time keeping up with this group, so we changed <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; setting and are getting a digest of the posts from this group. We <br/>
are <br/>
&gt; also getting the posts from the other group. We feel we stay better <br/>
&gt; informed on our area and are able to keep up with the USA group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Seal Beach Town Tour was brutal, we loved it, just wish we had more <br/>
&gt; time. We are going to attempt the rest. Good job on your efforts.<br/>
&gt; Take care, Jam n Jelly<br/>
