<br/>
<br/>Mary and I spent Saturday hunting you letterboxes.  We had a great time in The Park and were able to find all but the Critter Collection Box.  I think we were in the right spot but  it seems to be missing.  Nice stamps. thanks you.
<br/>
<br/>As for your box called The Place.  We found the 4 letter named grave site and were able to find the downed tree, but alas, no box.  I guess it's possible we were at the wrong downed tree, but we checked the few in the area, and felt pretty certain we would have found the letterbox had it been there.  Actually, I hope we missed it, as I'd hate to see two of your boxes gone so soon after being planted.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks, again, for the fine afternoon of boxing.
<br/>
<br/>Priscilla
