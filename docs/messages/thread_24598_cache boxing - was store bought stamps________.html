I've found many Geocaches this way. I like to check for geocaches in any<br/>
locale that I'm thinking of planting a letterbox. Sometimes you can find<br/>
trinkets in side that you can use as stamps (cleaning it afterwards of<br/>
course).<br/>

Hey, John,,,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the link!  I didn't realize that about cache boxing,,, and <br/>
I did find a geocache the other day under the same tree that a <br/>
letterbox was in.  I thought it was maybe another letterbox 'till I <br/>
opened it...  LOTS of different trinkets, etc.  Think I'll go back, <br/>
and visit that place,,,  :-)<br/>
