Dear Missy and company,<br/>
<br/>
We have recently gone through several iterations of trying to solve <br/>
just this dilemma. It is a very good question.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, the best answer I can give is this: if you cannot find the <br/>
box despite your best efforts, write an email to the owner of the <br/>
box. Each box up at letterboxing.org has a placer listed and a link <br/>
to their email. Click on that email and try to contact the owner. <br/>
Tell them that you are having trouble, where you looked, and what the <br/>
area looked like. Incluse a pic if you can of the area you think is <br/>
the place where the box is missing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, do not assume just because you cannot find a box that it is not <br/>
there. Sometimes it takes me a couple of months to retry that search <br/>
and get it. Sometimes a landmark like a fence post might be taken <br/>
down. Sometimes the box was taken up for maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
A followup tactic is to write here and ask if anyone else has found <br/>
or has had difficulty finding said box. That can be reassuring if you <br/>
are just wondering if it is just you. I recently posted that one of <br/>
my boxes was missing. Turns out that it had been moved by other <br/>
unknown letterboxers and then restored by a determined set of finders <br/>
(thanks, GSD!) <br/>
<br/>
There is another group discussion board, an EZ Board, at <br/>
http://pub188.ezboard.com/bletterboxingnorthamerica<br/>
You can also check there for status changes. I post there, as well as <br/>
here. The posts are organized by area and are thus easier to find.<br/>
<br/>
And before I sign off, let me give you my thanks for starting in on <br/>
this wonderful pasttime. Mark your plants as "Not a Geocache" <br/>
physically and clearly on the box. Hide you boxes well. Rehide <br/>
others' boxes well so they cannot be seen in any direction. Use <br/>
discretion in whom you tell about letterboxing. Read as many posts <br/>
here as you can, including FAQs. And if you think you have a stupid <br/>
question and are afraid of being flamed, write to me directly. <br/>
Although not a moderator, I love this stuff and understand about <br/>
being new, promise.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome aboard!  As we're practically neighbors (LOL), I look <br/>
forward to the day that we actually can look for your letterboxes!  <br/>
Alaska is one of my dream destinations--I've flown over it over a <br/>
dozen times and seen it from the air but have never actually landed <br/>
there.  Perhaps, we'll get an opportunity to do just that in the <br/>
next few months?  Sorry about the frustration with missing <br/>
letterboxes.  I have a feeling that many letterboxes placed in <br/>
Alaska are placed by vacationers--so they're often geographical <br/>
orphans.  Hawai'i has a similar problem in that many (currently all) <br/>
of its letterboxers are placed by vacationers.  If you are able to <br/>
find some of the letterboxes, perhaps you might consider adopting <br/>
some of them--to ensure future finders aren't frustrated, either?  <br/>
It's worked rather nicely so far with my Hawai'i letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome to this really cool hobby &amp; we look forward to <br/>
finding your boxes in the future!<br/>
