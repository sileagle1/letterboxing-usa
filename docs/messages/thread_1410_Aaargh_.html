use your backspace key trying to send a message from the webste, like <br/>
I'm doing now? I mean, I was afraid to go back and correct that <br/>
misplet word, website, because I keep losing the message I'm trying <br/>
to send and have to start anew. It's happened twice so far on this <br/>
post. It doesn't always happen, just occasionally. Does anyone else <br/>
have this problem? Is it a system bug? I know it isn't my machine. <br/>
Wow, I just backed up 6 spaces to make a correction and it didn't <br/>
happen. Vent off.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I was going to post to begin with was my observation that <br/>
there are an awful lot of short first names of letterboxers, not to <br/>
mention multiples. Jays, Kays, and Tom's. Eric, Dan, and others.<br/>
<br/>
Sure glad my name is Mark  :-)<br/>
