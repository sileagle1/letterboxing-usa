yourselves and on the wee ones that like to ramble in the brush? :) And<br/>
a more sensitive question...how do you protect bare skin when nature<br/>
calls?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a timely question for us - we just launched the TEXAS TICK<br/>
hitchhiker into the wilds of South Texas! Folks are warned to pass this<br/>
HH on ASAP to avoid being LYMED (The TEXAS TICK includes a couple boxes<br/>
of lime-flavored tic-tacs).<br/>
But we have also included a page of more serious cautions about ticks:<br/>
<br/>
LYME DISEASE <br/>
(The Serious Stuff)<br/>
<br/>
Although we are making light of it, LYME disease is no laughing matter.<br/>
Lyme disease is a bacterial infection that can cause skin, joint, heart<br/>
and nervous system problems. The disease usually begins with flu-like<br/>
symptoms such as fatigue, headache, fever, stiff neck and joint pain.<br/>
There may be skin lesions or rashes around the bite. Treatment is with<br/>
antibiotics. Untreated, Lyme disease may result in severe damage to<br/>
joints, the heart and nervous system. <br/>
To protect from ticks: <br/>
.	Check your body for them every few hours. They are small, and<br/>
attach to any part of the body head to toe. <br/>
.	Stay on trails outdoors; avoid areas of overgrown brush and tall<br/>
grasses. <br/>
.	Wear light-colored clothes to easily spot ticks. Protect skin<br/>
from tick bites; wear a hat, long-sleeved shirt and long pants tucked<br/>
into boots or socks. <br/>
.	Use insect repellent containing DEET or permethrin (follow<br/>
directions). <br/>
If you do find a tick, remove it right away, using tweezers to grasp the<br/>
tick at the skin surface. If tweezers aren't available, use a tissue to<br/>
protect fingers from the tick's body fluids. With a steady motion, pull<br/>
the tick straight out. Don't crush the tick's body. Be patient! It takes<br/>
time to do properly. Using Vaseline or touching the tick with a hot<br/>
match may be common practices but are not the best procedures. <br/>

When I ran a Cub Scout day camp here in Texas, I dusted my ankles with<br/>
sulphur powder which seemed to repel chiggers and ticks and my<br/>
husband...;-)<br/>

I recently invested in a great pair of tai-chi pants because they have<br/>

Try cotton gauze pants and shirts (they're not as see-thru as they<br/>
sound, I promise!)- they work well here in Dallas, where anything under<br/>
100 degrees on a summer day is a cold front!<br/>
