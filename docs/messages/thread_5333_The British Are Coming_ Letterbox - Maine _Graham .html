Please also be sure to report between 9am and sunset.</p> <p>Make sure to bring your own compasses and whale oil lamps. Weâ€™ll supply the weapons. </p> <p>The British are coming the British are coming! A British warship has been spotted trying to sneak up the Penobscot river. All militia are hereby ordered to report at once to the fort. Muster at the main entrance. A ship has been spotted north of the fort, make haste to "B" battery and proceed to the bottom (whale oil lamps will be very helpful). At the bottom you will find more steps on the eastern side, double time down until you emerge from the fort. Looking south you will see a massive wall. Climb 10-11 steps then proceed 3-4 paces south, look in the wall for the hidden cannon! (Be very careful and discreet, there are numerous foreign spies who would love to destroy our hidden ammunition). When you find it, fire at will!! Congratulations you sank the enemy vessel!</p> <p>But wait! Several British soldiers were spotted trying to infiltrate the fort on the southern edge of the compound. Run due south past the exit for battery "A" until you come to the powder magazine. Turn southeast and scale the wall where you will see the path the British soldiers took. Chase them as far as the first White Pine on your left. Look under pine needles on the western side of the tree. </p> <p>Congratulations you have successfully protected the fort from foreign invasion. You are free to spend the rest of the day exploring the area.</p><br/><br/></div></body></html>
