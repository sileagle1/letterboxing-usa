I thought Halleluia Hoyden was real, but you said it was a reprise <br/>
of the Smithsonian surprise.  Oooh, that was a mean trick :-)  Did <br/>
I miss a post somewhere or some good gossip at a gather?  I <br/>
thought one of the list members had met him at a ministry <br/>
conference.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious,<br/>

they had met The Rev at a conference.  And then a bit later The Rev <br/>
posted something in code.  Did you break that code yet?  Revisit the <br/>
code and maybe some things will reveal themselves.<br/>

use more than one log-on.  <br/>
Don't assume that everyone acting like they know<br/>
one another actually do.<br/>
Nothing is as it seems.<br/>
You have to decide who is real and who is<br/>
