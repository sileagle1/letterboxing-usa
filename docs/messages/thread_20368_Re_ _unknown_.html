You would never run out of ideas if you did an urban legend series.  <br/>
My favorite is the one about a person going to a foreign country, <br/>
getting drugged and waking up with mysterious incisions (i.e. the <br/>
organ robbers who sell organs on the black market have struck again <br/>
and snatched a spare kidney). The pet rat brought back from Mexico <br/>
(person thought it was a dog) is another favorite tail..err, make <br/>
that tale of mine. <br/>
