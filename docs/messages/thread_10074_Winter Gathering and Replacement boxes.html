  I am looking forward to meeting a lot of you at the Winter<br/>
  Gathering in DC. Until then I will be making replacement boxes for my missing boxes. I am hoping some of you will volunteer to take these boxes and replace them or parts of them. It would count as a find for you, a sure find at that.<br/>
  I am trying to gather up a list of what is missing from all the past emails to me so hopefully I will have it covered. I have gotten better boxes, now that I know that the gladware ones won't last last for 2 years. Who knew at the time. So if you would like to replace one, come up to me at the gathering and we can talk. I am the one with gray hair (almost all white).<br/>
  Even if you don't want to hid a box please introduce yourself,I am looking forward to meeting everyone and of course exchanging stamps.<br/>
<br/>
  May there be lots of nuts in your life,<br/>

<p>Hi one of two gray squirrels!  We, unfortunately, cannot make it to the gathering.  But, we can and often do, make it to the Giant for Tupperware!  If you need more help with the boxes, please let us know!  BeMa<br/><br/></p></div>

</p><p>I am going to try to make a claim on a particular box to replace for you....Lake Frank Turtle was our very first find, but the stamp was missing from the box. So we saved a spot on the first page of our logbook, and we can't wait for it to be filled!!  Of course, if someone else is also eager to replace this particular box, we will just go find it again, but as our first it has special meaning for us.  And we'd love to help out with any others, too.
</p><p>I'll see you Saturday!
