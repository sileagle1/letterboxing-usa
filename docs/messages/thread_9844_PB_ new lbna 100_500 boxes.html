During that "Purple Heart" business I suggested the idea of creating<br/>
postal boxes for F100 and F500 (tradition has it that you count finds,<br/>
I'm not personally interested in creating ways to count other things).  <br/>
The idea was so popular I decided to create them myself :-)  So if <br/>
you are at F100 or F500 you can stamp in if you want to.  If you <br/>
don't care about numbers you can try to avoid them coming your <br/>
direction.  The reason I think its cool is that it can become a <br/>
log of all the boxes that were people's milestone boxes, and the <br/>
dates, etc. (you could even take the logbook back to the milestone <br/>
box and stamp it if you want to -- its a pretty big logbook)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; I am intrigued but don't understand how one stamps into a postal<br/>
&gt; box.  Can someone educate me?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Several of us wish to know the how's of this box.<br/>
<br/>
I post way to much to the list, but here goes since people are<br/>
asking questions.  First of all I don't deserve any credit for<br/>
this -- its basically legerdemaine's main idea fused with Alan's <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
And, I generally don't envision how people will find my <br/>
boxes, but ... I think it works exactly like Alan's box, just<br/>
with a different qualifier.  Anyway ...<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to mail them to two people (who have already been <br/>
chosen by the independent panel of judge) who have found 500 <br/>
and 100 boxes.  After that happens, I'm out of the picture <br/>
(tho it would be cool to have the 500 box come back at me <br/>
if I ever find that many, but I average F3 per month, so I <br/>
don't expect that to happen).<br/>
<br/>
So, if you get this box in the mail, you can stamp in, just as if<br/>
you found it in the woods.  That I think answers the first question.<br/>
"Rehiding" it involves mailing it to someone else who qualifies.<br/>
<br/>
As for how I could envision it working, if you have this box (as<br/>
above), you just do the same, send it to someone you know has<br/>
enough boxes.  And so on.  If you don't know, you can ask the list.<br/>
I have no idea who or how many people have F100 or F500, but a <br/>
perfectly reasonable strategy would be to organize yourselves, make<br/>
a list, and post it to the list and cooperate in getting it if<br/>
you want (tho I never envisioned people doing this).  Or, if <br/>
someone in a particular region gets it, you could say -- I have it,<br/>
lets meet here and all deal with it.  Or, best of all, bribe and<br/>
lobby for it, as I saw happen recently (tho it really isn't worth<br/>
going to that trouble, IMO).  Once it becomes an "old maid", meaning<br/>
you're stuck with it with no one who qualifies to send it to, I have<br/>
no idea what happens.<br/>
<br/>
I consider it to be a chain architecture, rather than hub and<br/>
spoke, tho someone other than me is free to be the hub if they<br/>
want to -- if the letterboxing world can figure a good way to <br/>
make sure everyone gets it, that would be cool, but I'm unfortunately <br/>
not the person for that job.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you want it, e-mail the list or who you think has it,<br/>
not me.  I think keeping the location of letterboxes secret is<br/>
fun ...<br/>

<br/>
I like your new letterbox idea.  I think it is pretty neat.  I <br/>
qualify for the 100 Find box, however, I do not wish to post my <br/>
mailing address to a public forum.  So, if the person who gets the <br/>
100 find box would like to send it to me (hint, hint) I will be happy <br/>
to email them with my mailing address.  <br/>
<br/>
Another idea, if the person who gets it lives in the North East &amp; is <br/>
planning to attend the winter gathering in MA maybe they would like <br/>
to bring it to the gathering (hint, hint.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Randy, for another creative idea.<br/>

That should put some names on the mailing list--<br/>
If you receive the letterbox, just pick someone from the list and <br/>

that some of these folks have passed the 500 mark already)<br/>
