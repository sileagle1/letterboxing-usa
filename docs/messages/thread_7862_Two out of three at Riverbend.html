Back out on the trail after two weeks off!  We headed over to Riverbend <br/>
where we discovered the newly placed Bee's Knees box.  It is sad to see that <br/>
all the little streams are dried up due to the drought and the pond is <br/>
choked with algae.  We did have fun trying to trace the progress of <br/>
something under the scummy water and we watched a trail of bubbles make its <br/>
way mysteriously across the surface....<br/>
<br/>
Then, back in the car and over to the other lot for the Possum Trot.  Once <br/>
we found a space (it was crowded today!) we set off.  The hike was a little <br/>
longer than we expected.  Thirteen minutes in grown up time translates to <br/>
about 30 when one of the "hikers" is a five year old intent on picking up <br/>
every feather on the path!  We met lots of doggies.  All of whose owners got <br/>
to hear the story of the pets at our house....  Lots of fishermen, kayakers <br/>
and picnickers.  The kids scrambled to find the possum trot box and loved <br/>
the stump!  I can't say we have ever seen one like that before!<br/>
<br/>
Back at the lot, we decided we were a little too pooped to try for the <br/>
third.  So, we'll save that for another day.  After all -- back home, today <br/>
is the day to take off the training wheels and we will need all our energy <br/>
for that (parents and child!!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun hunt!<br/>
