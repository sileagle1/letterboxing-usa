I was just informed by one of my colleagues here at the Trustees of <br/>
Reservations that she hasn't cleaned out her desk in 3 months and <br/>
realized that she'd been holding on to a LB that one of the property <br/>
guys brought to her after mowing. She said she knew just who to call <br/>
about this letterbox thing...<br/>
<br/>
Soooooo....I am waiting to receive this box from her.<br/>
<br/>
I don't wish to reveal too much, because, if my memory serves me, <br/>
this is a mystery box.<br/>
<br/>
So, if lonemasswolf would contact me off list, I can arrange to <br/>
either replace the box for you or get it back to you for you to <br/>
replace (or not).<br/>
