about doing shirts for the list members. Kinda of like what was done <br/>
for the merit badges and window stickers.  After doing the set up for <br/>
the screens realized that the logo was probally someone elses <br/>
property.  If someone behind the scenes would like a quote on shirts <br/>
just email me and we might be able to do something.<br/>

BRAVO! Steve,
</p><p>    The design belongs to Mitch Klink (Der Mad Stamper)
in Oregon.   Mitch is also the designer of our new website -
a very talented guy.  It is to your credit that you recognized the
work of an artist and stepped back from using the image without permission. 
I imagine a  T-shirt offer may be possible at some time (soon?) and
it seems logical to consider a group member as the supplier.  Thanks
for the offer.  If you see shirt noises happening and someone has
appeared to have forgotten you PLEASE speak up in a post to the Webmasters. 
Forgetfulness is a blight upon progress and we seem to commit our share
of omissions.
</p><p>Best regards,
<br/>Susan
