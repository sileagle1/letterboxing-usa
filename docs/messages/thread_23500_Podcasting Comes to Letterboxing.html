Although it took a few seconds to load, I would suggest the "Episode" <br/>

You did a great job!  This will make it much more easy to get others <br/>
interested in letterboxing and to know the basics.<br/>
<br/>
One suggestion I have is to include a "What to do if you find a <br/>
hitchhiker" and "what is a hitchhiker" as these are the two most asked <br/>
newbie questions and one might be in the first box they find.<br/>
