                    <html><body><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have been letterboxing for about six months now. I am about to attempt a thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail this summer. I was looking for letterboxes that were right on the trail or VERY close (or near "trail towns"). I have come up with a few from the LBNA map, but I was wondering whether any of you could add to my list. I would like to pick up some letterboxes along the way! </p>
<p>Here is the list I have come up with so far of the boxes I am considering:</p>
<p>The East Carson Letterbox (Markleevile, CA)</p>
<p>Yosemite Valley Letterbox (Tulomne Meadows, CA; I know this is a little off trail, but I may spend a few days here)</p>
<p>Donner Pine Cone Letterbox </p>
<p>Burney Falls Letterbox (Burney, CA)</p>
<p>Shakespeare Letterbox (Ashland, OR)</p>
<p>1 Oregon mystery letterbox (it isn't entirely a mystery box, but the clues don't mention where it is hid exactly. Therefore I will not reveal the name of the box so as not to ruin anyone's fun!)</p>
<p>Phantom Ship Letterbox (Crater Lake, OR)</p>
<p>Eagle Creek II Letterbox (Cascade Locks, OR; I am very excited about this alternate route of the PCT, sounds awesome!)</p>
<p>Eagle Creek Letterbox (Cascade Locks, OR)</p>
<p>Dog Mountain Letterbox (Carson, WA)</p>
<p>Snoqualmie Falls Letterbox Series (Snoqualmie, WA)</p>
<p>Preston-Snoqualmie Trail Viewpoint Letterbox (Fall City, WA)</p>
<p>Any comments about the condition of these boxes, how accessable they would be to me as a PCT thru-hiker (I think I have a pretty good idea, but if there is any info you think I wouldn't have), or any other boxes to add to this list would me much appreciated! Thanks in advance for your responses!</p>

not be too far off the trail (it's in Dunsmuir's City Park)--it all <br/>
depends where you plan to stock up on food along the way.  Also, <br/>
Craggy Castle is not terribly far off of the PCT but it might be a <br/>
bit out of your way, depending on where you take your breaks.  Not <br/>
sure where PCT goes from that area but the Mt Shasta LB might be <br/>
relatively close to it, too.  (I'm a bit clueless if/where the trail <br/>
crosses the Mt Shasta region.  If you plan on restocking near Mt <br/>
Shasta City, there's an LB there in the City Park, too.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
However, as for letterboxing, there are TWO letterboxes on Dog <br/>
Mountain, although the second one is hidden as one of twelve boxes <br/>
that make up the African Safari Series.<br/>
<br/>
The Gillette Lake letterbox, also a part of the African Safari <br/>
Series, is directly on the Pacific Crest Trail if I recall correctly, <br/>
so you'll have to go maybe 20 or so feet out of your way for that <br/>
one.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Depending on how far out of the way you're willing to go for <br/>
letterboxes, ALL of the African Safari Series are in the Columbia <br/>
River Gorge (which the PCT does pass through), although others may <br/>
not be as close to the PCT as you'd like.<br/>
<br/>
I also know the PCT passes near Mount Hood, although I admit to not <br/>
knowing it's exact route.  But I hid several letterboxes on and near <br/>
Mount Hood which might be fairly close to the PCT if not directly on <br/>
it.  You can see them on my website at <br/>
http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb/US/OR .  The Mount Hood area <br/>
boxes are seperated out from the rest!<br/>
<br/>
If I weren't running around hiking the Appalachian Trail, I'd love to <br/>
pick you up in the gorge and show you around the Portland area and <br/>
boxes all over the place you could nab.  And hear about your <br/>
adventures on the trail!<br/>
<br/>
But alas, I'll have my own adventures to attend to.  *sigh*  Good <br/>
luck!<br/>

<div>Patrick, The East Carson box near Markleeville is a 
"boat in" letterbox. It is 1/2 way down river from Markleeville, Ca. to 
Gardnerville, Nevada. I'm not sure where the PCT is around Kernville ( Ok I'm a 
white water boater not a hiker) but you might check the map on our Anniversary/ 
Western Divide, Dome Rock, and Leprechaun boxes in section 5, Calif.
