Location:  State: MA   County: Barnstable   Town: Bourne  <br/>
       Cape Cod Canal Bikepath/Service road  - Mainland side<br/>
<br/>
Planted by: Tweety and Mr. Coon  10/02/02<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy on foot or on human powered wheels of your choice. <br/>
<br/>
Driving directions: From Rt. 195 east go south on Rt.25 towards the <br/>
Bourne Bridge. Turn off at the last exit before the bridge, go around <br/>
the rotary (past the landlocked tugboat) and, <br/>
<br/>
(1) if you want to cycle the canal   -  turn right into the town of <br/>
Buzzards Bay and continue along the main street until you see the <br/>
railroad lift bridge. The seven mile long bike path begins here. Turn <br/>
left into the parking lot for the Buzzards Bay Recreation Area. The <br/>
box is 2 miles east (north) along the bike path.<br/>
<br/>
or (2) if you want to walk to the box  -  you may want to go farther <br/>
around the rotary and follow Rt. 6  under the bridge to parallel the <br/>
canal. There are two scenic turnoffs on the right side of the road, <br/>
the second of which gives spectacular views of the canal, its valley, <br/>
and the glacial moraines that form the part of Cape Cod next to the <br/>
canal on the other side. At the bottom of the hill lies the Herring <br/>
Run Recreation Area in Bournedale. There are restroom facilities <br/>
here. If you park and walk from here the box is about 1.5 miles west <br/>
(south). Make sure you check out the herring run and there is also a <br/>
nature trail that leads from here. <br/>
<br/>
Directions to the box:<br/>
Near the 2 mile northward/ 5 mile southward mark look for a culvert <br/>
on the landward side of the path with a section of white fence behind <br/>
it, near this on the seaside edge of the path is a small <br/>
(2 or 3 inches in diameter) Corps of Engineers survey marker ( gps <br/>
269). The box hides behind the base of a utility pole with the number <br/>
270 on it in letters large enough to read from passing vessels. The <br/>
stamp is an on-site effort. Our motto is "Any stamp is good if it <br/>
gets people to go to places they might enjoy." <br/>
<br/>
The Cape Cod canal was completed in 1914 (it opened 17 days before <br/>
the Panama Canal), but it was conceived far earlier.  Miles Standish <br/>
and the Massachusetts Bay colonists contemplated digging a canal here <br/>
to connect two river valleys across this neck of land and President <br/>
George Washington was another early proponent of a canal here to <br/>
avoid British blockades. After several false starts in the late <br/>
1800's it was built by private company and then sold to the <br/>
government during WW I.  The canal has since been maintained by the <br/>
Army Corps of Engineers. It is the world's widest sea level canal. <br/>
The channel is maintained at 32 feet deep. The Bourne Bridge is 2385 <br/>
long and 135 feet above the water.  <br/>
<br/>
If you plan to ride the length of the path be advised that its often <br/>
quite breezy here so it might be well to take the wind into <br/>
consideration and start from whichever end you need to that day to <br/>
head into the wind so that the return trip will be easier. Most times <br/>
we've been there the wind has been blowing from Bourne (the west or <br/>
Buzzards Bay end) to Sagamore ( the east or Cape Cod Bay end). <br/>
If you want to go the Cape Cod end there are several good places to <br/>
park at the Sagamore end. <br/>
There are other boxes near the Scusset Beach end, including the <br/>
Sagamore Hill Letterbox and the Cape Cod Canal letterbox ( which is <br/>
listed as in Plymouth County ). If you continue on Rt 6 to the <br/>
Sagamore Bridge rotary ( intersection with Rt. 3 coming down from <br/>
Boston)  take the first turn past the bridge (Canal Street) off the <br/>
Sagamore Bridge rotary there's a parking lot right near the base of <br/>
the bridge. If you take the second turn ( Scusset Beach Road) from <br/>
the rotary  and follow it to the end it takes you to Scusset beach <br/>
and camping area, a place worth investigating anyway. Before the <br/>
campground there is a large parking area right next to the canal <br/>
where there are restroom facilities, snack bar and tables overlooking <br/>
the canal. The docks here are a popular fishing spot.<br/>
