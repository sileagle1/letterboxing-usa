<br/>
Difficulty - easy - one degree harder than easy.  Don't worry, you'll <br/>
find them.<br/>
Time - an hour and a half if you are just out to bag some boxes. <br/>
More if you want to get to know the place, it's luminaries and trees.<br/>
Distance - I meant to check this, but forgot.  You tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Any problems or box needs can be emailed to rtrw@attbi.com.  We are <br/>
new enough letterboxers that we know mistakes are likely.  Thanks for <br/>
your patience.  Enjoy this beautiful place.<br/>
<br/>
Cedar Hill Cemetery is located at 453 Fairfield Avenue, Hartford, <br/>
Connecticut.  I checked the Yahoo Map feature, and it gave me good <br/>
directions.<br/>
You can find a printable and helpful map and other information at <br/>
www.cedarhillcemetery.org/TourMap.htm. <br/>
Entrance is through the main gate only<br/>
The gate is open from 7:00 a.m. to dusk daily<br/>
Dogs aren't allowed.  Sorry, pups.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have enjoyed this cemetery for years (I know that sounds a little <br/>
morbid). I hope you will find it as beautiful and educational as I <br/>
have.  Before you head into the cemetery, please be aware that though <br/>
there is substantial historical value here Cedar Hill is a modern <br/>
cemetery, as well.  Please be conscientious of, and compassionate to <br/>
those who may be mourning or visiting the gravesite of loved ones.  <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Turn into Cedar Hill Cemetery.  Here, on the right side of the big <br/>
bowl/fountain, you may pick up your Guide for Visitors and Guide to <br/>
Notable Trees.  Proceed to the place on the right where you may park <br/>
your car.  Hop out, grab your bag and hit the path, heading in the <br/>
same direction.  <br/>
<br/>

This is my "ungifted artist" attempt to copy a very beautiful and <br/>
dramatic feature of this cemetery.  Hopefully you will know what I<br/>
was going for if you go by the real thing later.  Heads up, there is <br/>
poison ivy in front of the reclining log, so step gingerly and don't <br/>
wear sandals.  Trust me in this.  I wore sandals to plant.  Again.  <br/>
You would think I would know better by now.<br/>
<br/>
The Clues:<br/>
Very, very shortly after the parking area you will see a cement<br/>
bridge over a stream on your left.  There are wooden posts with a <br/>
chain between them.  I'm not sure if the chain is always there, but<br/>
no matter, follow the path into the somewhat wooded area.  I counted <br/>
65 steps from the bridge and looked left.  I saw a fallen tree and<br/>
hid <br/>
something for you at the southern end.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Horace Wells Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Wells was born at the turn of the nineteenth century. A Hartford <br/>
resident, he was a dentist whose discovery of anesthesia banished <br/>
surgical pain, revolutionized surgery, and brought safety and comfort <br/>
to the operating room. Wells became known as the best dentist in <br/>
Hartford -- an area that was known for excellent dentistry. He <br/>
championed the slogan, "the clean tooth does not decay!" which was <br/>
used into the twentieth century to encourage children to clean their <br/>
teeth. Because of his creativity, Wells even designed his own <br/>
instruments and discovered dental procedures to aid in these methods. <br/>
 Up to the 1840's, surgery was very painful to the patient, forcing <br/>
surgeons to hurry through the procedure, thereby not allowing for <br/>
quality care. Previously, methods to combat pain included alcohol, <br/>
opium, and even hypnotism.  Wells claimed that a patient could be <br/>
gassed with nitrous oxide, feel no pain during the procedure, and <br/>
awake feeling little, if any, discomfort.  Several other people <br/>
claimed the discovery as their own and Wells never received credit<br/>
for his discovery during his lifetime.  Sadly, he did himself in.  I<br/>
chose Wells because he never received any respect for his discovery <br/>
when he was alive.  Having been under anesthesia twice, I am very <br/>
thankful for it.   He, also, has a wild headstone.  <br/>
<br/>
The Clues:<br/>
Go back to the pavement and head up toward the cemetery, passing Llyn <br/>
Mawr.  Follow the pavement to the left as it turns until you reach <br/>
section 4.  Find the creative and interesting Horace Wells headstone. <br/>
Check it out.  OK, go back to the pavement and continue in the <br/>
direction you were going.  You should soon pass the old rugged cross. <br/>
Your next headstone to find is the one that belongs to the family of <br/>
"positive wealth".  Stand near it and then walk toward 120 degrees to <br/>
the "essence of faith" headstone. (and this will be my last attempt<br/>
at "clever" for today)  From the northern side of this headstone <br/>
take a compass reading of 30 degrees and walk to the gnarled tree. <br/>
Something you seek is waiting there, I hope.  These are the most <br/>
exhaustive groundskeepers in the history of time (a slight <br/>
exaggeration maybe, but they are very good and neat), so please <br/>
re-hide as well as you can.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

Sam Colt Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Samuel Colt was born in Hartford, Connecticut in 1814. He founded the <br/>
Colt Company and will be remembered for his production of revolving <br/>
cylinder weapons. Colt, Hartford's unabashed sales promoter, raised <br/>
the distinctive onion-shaped dome, topped with a cast-bronze rampant <br/>
colt, over his factory, thereby assuring that every Hartford resident <br/>
and visitor who saw the dome would ask about it and hear the Colt <br/>
success story (visible from Interstate 91 as you go south from <br/>
Hartford).  In 1856 he married Elizabeth Jarvis; the couple <br/>
had four children.  Sam died in January of 1862 at the age of 47. His <br/>
estate was reportedly worth $15 million, an enormous sum for the time <br/>
and tantamount to more than $300 million today.   In 1866, Elizabeth <br/>
commissioned a magnificent monument for the newly purchased Colt <br/>
family burial plot in Hartford's new rural cemetery, Cedar Hill,<br/>
where she, Sam, and their children are now buried.<br/>
<br/>
The Clues:<br/>
Head back to the pavement and continue on in the same direction you <br/>
were heading in before.  Take your first opportunity to take a paved <br/>
right and head up the hill.  There is a Sam Colt on the corner of <br/>
section 3, but not the one for whom we are looking.  Gideon Welles, <br/>
Abraham Lincoln's secretary of the navy will be on your left.  Stop <br/>
when you see the highly decorated Stedman coffin memorial on your <br/>
left.  Go up the small incline to your right.  You will first pass<br/>
the impressive Beach monument.  The same architect who designed the <br/>
Connecticut State capitol, designed this.  When you leave today, run <br/>
by the capitol and see how similar this is to it.  The next rather <br/>
impressive structure is the memorial for Sam and Elizabeth Jarvis <br/>
Colt.  After you peek, head back to the Stedman Obelisk.  From the <br/>
northwest corner of this imposing piece, get a compass reading of 220 <br/>
degrees and head toward a large needle-y bush.  Sam's most <br/>
identifiable structure (actually my attempt at it) is hidden beneath <br/>
the southeast side.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
JP Morgan Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
John Pierpont Morgan<br/>
<br/>
Born in Hartford, Conn., the son of a financier, he began his career <br/>
as an accountant in 1857 and then became a big league rich guy.  He <br/>
was, more importantly, a philanthropist.  JP became one of the<br/>
world's most powerful railroad magnates, controlling about 5,000<br/>
miles of railway by 1902.  He financeda series of giant industrial <br/>
consolidations, organizing the mergers that formed General Electric, <br/>
U.S. Steel and International Harvester.  A noted art collector, he <br/>
donated many artworks to the Metropolitan Museum of Art; his book <br/>
collection and the building that housed it became the Pierpont Morgan <br/>
Library.  I don't know why, but I was surprised that he was born and <br/>
buried in Hartford.  <br/>
<br/>
The Clues:<br/>
<br/>
If you have a map, go to cemetery section 11.  If you don't, read on. <br/>
 Go back to your last place you were on the pavement. Continue <br/>
heading toward the back of the cemetery and when you come to the<br/>
5-way intersection, take the option at 310 degrees.  The large Morgan <br/>
monument will be on your left shortly.  Find the "older" John<br/>
Pierpont Morgan stone (there are two) that is to the left of the<br/>
large reddish stone as you face it from the road.  From the small <br/>
stone go 12 steps at 290 degrees, then 15 steps at 190 degrees.  Look <br/>
left.  The thing you seek is between the rhody and the conifer.   It <br/>
occurs to me now that a rhody's leaves will curl up when it gets <br/>
colder, so please do a better job in the hiding than I probably did.  <br/>
Thanks.  <br/>

Crying Woman Letterbox<br/>
This one was sort of a personal one for me.  In March of 2002, some <br/>
workmen in my home accidentally allowed my 13-year-old Siamese cat, <br/>
Grace, out of our house and we never saw her again.   It's pathetic <br/>
how attached I was to the old girl, so when I began letterboxing in <br/>
April I used a Siamese cat stamp as my personal one.  After <br/>
realizing that carving is something I enjoy (note: not "am good at", <br/>
but enjoy), I decided to start searching out an image to carve as my <br/>
I.D.  It's still a work in progress, but after I carved this stamp <br/>
which I based upon a beautiful statue here at Cedar Hill it seemed a <br/>
fitting place and stamp to recognize the departure of my old friend.  <br/>
I miss her.  I doubt there will ever be another like her.     <br/>
<br/>
The Clues:<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is hidden in a more modern section of the cemetery, so <br/>
please be especially aware of anyone who is there on a personal<br/>
visit.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a beautiful sunset as I was planting the JP Morgan box, so if <br/>
it's evening, it might be worth the wait.  When you are ready to move <br/>
on to this last box, head. You know .Back to the road,<br/>
going still toward the rear (mostly modern) section of the cemetery.  <br/>
You are looking for the resting place of Wallace Stevens in section <br/>
14.  <br/>
Stevens characterized himself as the "hermit of poetry" and he spent <br/>
his days as a Hartford insurance executive and his nights as a poet.  <br/>
Those without a computer map will need to know that you stay on the <br/>
road and take the first chance to turn right, then a left after <br/>
section 22, then another right which brings you to the aforementioned <br/>
section 14.  Find Wallace Stevens' head stone.  The day I was there I <br/>
noticed that someone had placed a mussel shell as well as the <br/>
traditional rocks on top of the stone.  From the left side of the<br/>
head stone walk 28 steps at about 265 degrees.  Five steps at 200 <br/>
degrees from the Rogers stone is a small grove of trees.  The crying <br/>
woman is hidden in, what I believe to be, some hanging cedar brush <br/>
within.  If you are interested, the actual sculpture upon which the <br/>
crying woman stamp is based is in section 6.<br/>
<br/>
