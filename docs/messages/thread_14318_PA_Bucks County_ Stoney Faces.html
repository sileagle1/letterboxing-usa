A word to the wise, should you attempt this series of <br/>
letterboxes...<br/>
<br/>
The clue list mentions this:<br/>
<br/>
"Find the place where rout 611 meets rout 412. Follow 412 north <br/>
to Stony Garden Rd and turn Rt. Look for # 1984 on the Rt. And <br/>
you will find the parking lot on the left."<br/>
<br/>
If you approach this site from 412, heading NORTH - Stony <br/>
Garden Road is on the LEFT, NOT the RIGHT! (or Rt., if that's <br/>
what was meant.)<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, we found this clue set *fuzzy*, and while we <br/>
enjoyed the site, had to  give up the search as we simply saw <br/>
NOTHING that confirmed we were on the right track.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else found this set recently?<br/>
<br/>
(If these boxes *are* still there, they represent a greater <br/>
challenge than we were prepared for ... Time to move on to NJ <br/>
Boxes, it would seem.)<br/>
