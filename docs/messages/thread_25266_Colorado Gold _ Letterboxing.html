                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi to all in LB land, We will be driving to Colorado and getting there in the beginning of June. It's a long ways from here in the Catskills of New York but its our intentions to make it in our FIT with our dog Maxwell Smart. He's not the same type of dog that Bud was, he's slow learner to finding letterboxes. Ha! Must be the beagle in him. Anyway, We will have our camping gear with us and was wondering if there are any letterboxes in areas that are along public streams that we can play along. I was thinking about getting  some sieves to bring with us and try it if we were in a good area for that sort of thing and stamp in some LB's for the fun of it. Bringing my GTA-350 metal detector too.  We will be in Colorado for about 3 days, wish we had more time, maybe again some time.  Peace &amp; Love ....  budster of the Catskills<br/>
