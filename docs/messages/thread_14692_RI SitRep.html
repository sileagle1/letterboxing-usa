good hike, and I've learned the lesson that I should buy bug spray.  <br/>
There was two things that worried me:<br/>
<br/>
1. The Contents including the logbook felt damp.  No sign of visible <br/>
condesation inside the box, but I think it needs a new pad/log <br/>
book...and the 'trinkets' to be taken - I don't think people want old <br/>
batteries or a dirty orange balloon - hey that's my opinion.  Someone <br/>
needs to clean the box, replace the log book, and possibly the stamp <br/>
pad, and just throw the rest away.  The box has been abandoned, the <br/>
original planter was Molly and Quahog.  If anyone knows them, please <br/>
contact them.<br/>
<br/>
2. The second thing is when I came out of the forest - there was a 1 <br/>
1/2 foot long snake that I stepped over - and didn't notice it until <br/>
stamping in! YIKES! :-D<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday, 7/27, Pigtographer and I went out and found the Native Sun <br/>
Series - consisting of 5 stamps.  The scenery was great - saw the <br/>
little present that Wanda and Pete left Todd (now the tree can shield <br/>
its eye from the sun...heeheehee) and again, bug spray was wanted.  <br/>
We had a great time and a wonderful 2 1/2 hour hike through the woods.<br/>
