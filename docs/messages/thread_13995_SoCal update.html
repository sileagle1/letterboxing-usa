box in LA's Griffith Park earlier this week with little problem. I winced a <br/>
little when I saw Pandora's stamp and note about boxing with her aunts from <br/>
a few weeks earlier, knowing how the rest of their day ended up. As Pandora <br/>
noted in her later update of this box, the clues note two boxes but if <br/>
there's really a second one there, we too were unable to find it. It's <br/>
possible to interpret the clues as leading to a second box, but the spot <br/>
indicated seems to be the exact same location as the first box.<br/>
<br/>
The next day I went to check on my orphaned Terre et Eau box in Costa Mesa. <br/>
Kept company by the howls of nearby coyote as I read through the log book, <br/>
I was pleased to see how many people (and one HH - Virginia is for Lovers) <br/>
have visited. Many people noted how mucky the trail gets when it rains, so <br/>
be aware of this if you plan to visit some day. I added a new stash of <br/>
postcards to the box, but otherwise all was well.<br/>
