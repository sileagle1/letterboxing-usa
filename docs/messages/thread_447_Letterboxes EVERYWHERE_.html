&gt;So, while I think this is a good idea, (as good as the first<br/>
&gt;in each state/charity walk idea), I ask you to err on the side<br/>
&gt;of caution when it comes to using parks.  And, in general, I<br/>
&gt;ask that you always consider what you put in your letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, duh, Dan--of course we'll consider what we put in our letterboxes.<br/>
Sheesh.  Who died and made you Dad?  (I know it's hard to hear the playful<br/>
tone in that phrase, so trust me --it's there!)<br/>
<br/>
I like the variety of ideas we bounce off of each other, but I think it's<br/>
important to avoid imposing too many rules on each other...that inhibits<br/>
the new and tentative boxers, don't you think?<br/>

Yes, I think I did go overboard and have been overly cautious a couple<br/>
of<br/>
times in recent posts.<br/>
I apologize to Julie and to whoever else may have been offended.<br/>

<br/>
Apology accepted.  It even affects the non-tenative boxers :-), and <br/>
goes on to much sometimes, IMHO.  I am glad it worked out this way, <br/>
because I like it here and feel others enjoy what I do, and I enjoy<br/>
what I do, and I enjoy what others do (especially those Braintree <br/>
Curiousities :-)) and quite frankly, never saw myself doing anything<br/>
that did not fit in with the group was doing. :-)  My attitude is <br/>
that people will seek the boxes that suit their fancy.  Live and let<br/>
live.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time,<br/>
