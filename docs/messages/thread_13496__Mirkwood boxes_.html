In preparing for a boxing weekend (my first chance in a LONG time!), <br/>
I wanted to hit some of Ruthann's boxes in Wayne Co. I found a couple <br/>
last year, but had many more to hunt for. I went print out the clues <br/>
and noticed they're not on the new site. Went to the old site and <br/>
none of the links work.<br/>

Bobwhite Nature Trail and Jabberwocky.  Mirkwood's website mentioned <br/>

down.  Jabberwocky eluded us briefly, but we soon found our mistake.  <br/>
And Bobwhite Nature Trail was in full wildflower bloom, with <br/>
mayapples and trillium.  2 great locations for boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as of that date, the Crosswinds Marsh and Bald Eagle boxes were <br/>
still at Crosswinds Marsh.   A very neat place to visit, if you've <br/>
never been!  Lots of boardwalks and trails to explore, and there were <br/>
2 bald eagles nesting in the trees in the middle of the marsh.  Both <br/>
boxes were in place, though they had gotten a bit damp recently.<br/>

If you need a copy of any of those 4 clues, you can e-mail me off-<br/>

<br/>
That's wierd, her site must have been down or something. I tried <br/>
Sunday and Monday and just kept getting "bad gateway" messages, when <br/>
I clicked on the box names. But now the link works. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help,<br/>
