I started counting attempts, because I found they usually took more of my<br/>
time than finds (because "it's gotta be around here somewhere!" or "Maybe if<br/>
I try the clues THIS way?" LOL)<br/>
Lucky you having an artist friend willing to carve for you and your friends.<br/>
Even so, I'd try your hand at carving. I had my doubts about my abilities as<br/>
a carver and my first few stamps kind of reinforced my doubts :-) But with<br/>
practice, I've gotten much better &amp; found that I really enjoy the carving.<br/>
It's a great artistic outlet, even though I'm using clip art :-)<br/>

Thanks for the greet Scoutdogs, I already talked to a few friends at UMass<br/>
who want to do this too! One of them is an artist and she said she'd make<br/>
all our stamps :-) What does Attempts stand for? Tries that were not<br/>
successful?<br/>
