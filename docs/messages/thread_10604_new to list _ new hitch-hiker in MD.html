                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sarah is going to kick me once she reads this e-mail!  She told me <br/>
time and time again that the clues for these boxes were too confusing <br/>
but I didn't change them.  <br/>
<br/>
It is very rare for me to write anything but straightforward <br/>
directions to our boxes so I am sorry to say that I will not change <br/>
the clues, but I will offer you some hints.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that this is a story and that all items mentioned in the <br/>
story do not appear on the path exactly as they are listed in the <br/>
text.  Pay careful attention to the wording of each direction.  These <br/>
boxes are not far from Firefly's set and they are not far off of the <br/>
path.  <br/>
<br/>
Firefly herself had some difficulty finding the first box but <br/>
eventually located it once she freed up her thinking a bit.  Keep <br/>
trying and you will be rewarded.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the fray!<br/>
