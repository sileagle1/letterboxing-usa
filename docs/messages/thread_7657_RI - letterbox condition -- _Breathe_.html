                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday while out hiking on one of my favorite trails I stopped by <br/>
the "Breathe" letterbox to check on its status. it is in AOK shape, <br/>
however, no one has been there in a very long time :(  I can't <br/>
understand why since this is a beautiful spot, great trails with <br/>
woonderful views.  As much as I enjoy doing all the new letterboxes, <br/>
I find the older boxes particularly satisifying.  The "Breathe" <br/>
letterbox is one of the first letterboxes in RI &amp; probably in the <br/>
US.  The series name "Live &amp; Breathe" is taken from the title of the <br/>
original Simsonian article that started the letterbox craze in this <br/>
country.  So if you are looking for a different letterbox hike with a <br/>
little history, some great views, and don't mind a long, rugged hike, <br/>
consider the "Live &amp; Breathe" boxes.  A little hint, the original <br/>
clues call for a 3 mile walk on Rt 165 and the total walk is probably <br/>
7 or 8 miles.  If you are familiar with the area, after doing the <br/>
Live &amp; Deep Pond boxes you can retrace your steps back to your car <br/>
and drive to the spot on Rt 165 where the trail goes into the woods <br/>
to do "Breathe".  This is truely some of the best hiking you will <br/>
find in the state of RI.<br/>
<br/>
PS. Jay, I hope you don't mind this small hint on shortening the hike.<br/>

Thank you so much, Janet, for checking in on "The Live and Breathe <br/>
Letterboxes," whose name was indeed plagarized from Chris' seminal <br/>
article in Smithsonian, "They Live and Breathe Letterboxes." (I've <br/>
had the pleasure of meeting Chris and hope he doesn't mind the copy-<br/>
catting...).<br/>
<br/>
And no, we don't mind the little hint, especially since we provided a <br/>
similar one to those who look hard enough on our website. If folks <br/>
ever want a nudge on one of our own letterboxes, please don't <br/>
hesitate to write.<br/>
