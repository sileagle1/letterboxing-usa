Sheesh! At least if I ever get to that part of the country, I'll <br/>
know exactly where to look! I take it the participant in the story <br/>
was NOT the owner of the boxes? If so, very uncouth. =(<br/>
<br/>
And now the owner gets the joy of wondering just when those nieces <br/>
and nephews are going to come tromping through the neighborhood to <br/>
find his/her boxes again. IF the boxes are still around by then. My <br/>
sympathies to the placer if you were unaware of this publicity.<br/>

I can not believe this report.  It not only gave very detailed clues <br/>
but showed the trail marker, how many steps to take &amp; the hiding <br/>
spot.  This is one of the worst I have seen.  I guess we can all mark <br/>
that box off the list-it will be gone in no time flat!<br/>

Well the newscaster offered up his email address if you had any <br/>
questions about letterboxing.  (of course I didn't write it down)  <br/>
But apparently we don't know if the girl was the placer and just <br/>
acting for her "15 minutes".  At least the box was shown being <br/>
replaced AND recovered/hidden.  If you have a concern it should be <br/>
directed to the newscaster.  Personally I couldn't really tell from <br/>
the blurb what box they were 'showing' -- although I think I've seen <br/>
that green dragon around -- but then it was a store bought stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think a TV blurb will attract more people than a mag article <br/>
folks can sit and read in the Dr's Offc and study and re-read?<br/>

I'd like to write to him directly rather than just clicking on the site's "contact us" link. Actually I think it would be a good idea if we all write to him and tell him what we think.  <br/>
