stamp itself said Frosty Drew down the side. But I have been told <br/>
that what we found is probably the "Nibiru" box.Could you clear this <br/>
up for me ?<br/>

Brian, so sorry for the confusion. I've never found that danged <br/>
Frosty Drew Quest. But, as an amateur astronomer and telescope maker <br/>
I have done some volunteer work at the observatory. So when we were <br/>
doing the Pole Shift series (which ended up being just that one box) <br/>
I carved in "Frosty Drew" without thinking that, well shoot, the name <br/>
was already taken. Ouch! To add to the confusion, we're planning on <br/>
re-cluing that box into a new series based on CS Lewis' Out of the <br/>
Silent Planet trilogy...<br/>
<br/>
Many who know have convinced me that the true Frosty Drew Quest is <br/>
history.<br/>
<br/>
(Ahem, whispers aside: For those who didn't meet him at the Moose <br/>
Hill Gathering, Brian is well on his way to becoming the premier <br/>
stamp artist in letterboxingdom. His stamps, oooooooooo!)<br/>
