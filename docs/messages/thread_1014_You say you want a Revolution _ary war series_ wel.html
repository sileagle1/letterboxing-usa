<br/>
Haven't heard the Drews say anything about this yet, sooooooo.....<br/>
<br/>
After OPSail2000 look for a series tied to the Revolotionary War <br/>
sites around the New London/ Waterford area So far I have plans for <br/>
at least 3 boxes...maybe more as the clues and research grows....I <br/>
wanted to wait untill after opsail so there would be a lesser chance <br/>
of vandalism....<br/>
<br/>

P.s. I know the "Ram" is planning on placing a box in Norwich which <br/>
could EASILY be tied to such a series<br/>
