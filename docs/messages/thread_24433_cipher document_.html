A while ago (last fall/winter?) someone had posted a message that<br/>
they had put together a several page document with various types of<br/>
ciphers, codes, cryptograms including tips, samples, etc. They<br/>
offered to email it to anyone interested.<br/>
<br/>
I asked for and received a copy, but it's now nowhere to be found on<br/>
my computer.<br/>
<br/>
I've searched every place, I've searched the message archives for<br/>
this group, the newboxers group and my local list and can't find the<br/>
original post anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Does this sound familiar to anyone? If so, and you have a copy or<br/>
know who I can ask for one, could you please let me know?<br/>
<br/>
I've run into a whole bunch of coded clues lately. I used to think I<br/>
was good at them, but these are all done in some weird style I've<br/>
never seen. So, I was hoping this document might be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
