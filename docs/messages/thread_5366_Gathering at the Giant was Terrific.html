New England letterboxers that showed up at the park!<br/>
<br/>
It is a lot of fun to match the faces with the stamps with the screen <br/>
names !! (and more than a little confusing sometimes!)  I think I <br/>
spent an hour or so with non-stop stamping into notebooks.  The <br/>
weather couldn't have been better!<br/>
<br/>
And on the way home, stopped at that famous Ice Cream place to try it <br/>
out, and it was Fantastic as advertised :-)<br/>
<br/>
All in all a terrific day!<br/>
