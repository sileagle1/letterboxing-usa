<br/>
it has been months now since i have seen you. i only hope you <br/>
haven't lost any hope that i will ever come home. you need not to <br/>
worry about me for that i am alright and seem to be in no immediate <br/>
harm. right now i find myself in this dark desolate room. on a taBle <br/>
in the far corner is a candle. who ever that has kidnapped me has <br/>
taken the liberty of lighting it for me every night.<br/>
<br/>
oh sherri, i miss you so. every night i think about you and how much <br/>
i wish to see you again. you are the only thing i look forward to <br/>
seeing when or if i ever leave this place. this person seems to care <br/>
nothing for me. he feeds me little and leaves me alone for hours at <br/>
a time. vermin run wild, nibbling at my feet from time to time. the <br/>
longer i am here the likely hood of me making it through this is <br/>
grim, but again i wish for you to not worry.<br/>
<br/>
you must NOTT ever stop looking for me. i wish i could give you some <br/>
sort of clue as to my location, but i was out cold, i would presume <br/>
for some time during move. this place doesn't look like the other i <br/>
was kept in. what i can tell you is it is getting cold here. there <br/>
are no windows and little to no heat. only the thoughts of you keep <br/>
me warm.<br/>
<br/>
sherri i must go now. i hear him coming. i will write again soon.<br/>

<br/>
i have grown so tired of the endless days. everyday seems to be the <br/>
other. water runs under the doOr now from the rain of this past <br/>
week, soaking my feet. making them hurt. sherri, i find myself <br/>
wasting away and i don't know how much more i can take. i miss you <br/>
so and need to get out of here.<br/>
<br/>
the other day i had tried to loosen the ropes around my wrists, and <br/>
just as i started to do so, he showed back up. sometimes he sits in <br/>
a chair across the room staring at me. i don't know his deal. what <br/>
does he want from me? what did i do that deserved this punishment.<br/>
<br/>
sherri, know this. i have been workING on an escape, but to where i <br/>
don't know. i don't even know where i am. but if i can manage to <br/>
work my way free from these ropes, i will run. just know that if i <br/>
get caught, you may never hear from me again. i will be sure to <br/>
write to you once more before i try my escape. wish me luck my love.<br/>

<br/>
today had to have been the worst day ever. he sat doWn and watched me <br/>
for an 2 hours while he ate food. the smell of the food he was eating <br/>
was driving me crazy. sherri, i need to get out of here, and like i <br/>
said, i will.<br/>
<br/>
i told you in my last letter, that i have been planning my escape. the <br/>
ropes that i have been tied up with have been worked loose enough for <br/>
me to get out of them. he hasn't checked them since before the last <br/>
letter i wrote. it's like his mind is elsewhere. i must take advantage <br/>
of his mistakes and act quickly.<br/>
<br/>
sherri, i may not write for weeks. not knowing where i am, it may take <br/>
me some time to find my way home. could you do me one favor, and never <br/>
stop praying that this will end soon, and pray that this plan i have <br/>
COOKed up works. wish me luck. i love you.<br/>

it is of great regret that i was unsuccessful in my attempt to escape <br/>
from the kidnapper. it seems that he knew of my plan and was waiting <br/>
outside for me. i don't know what to do aNymore. he hasn't fed or <br/>
given me water to drink in days and i have grown weak.<br/>
<br/>
i suppose there is some good news to come of my brief encounter with <br/>
the outside world. there were no leaves on the trees and i saw a <br/>
beautiful view. all i can remember is, there were mountians in the <br/>
distance. oh sherri, i would like nothing more than to show you what i <br/>
saw, but i don't even know where i saw this view. it was there, that <br/>
the kidnapper caught me and took me back to the shack he has kept me <br/>
in FOR so much time. he has grown more violent towards me. i'm scared.<br/>

sherri, i need you. please sherri. please.<br/>
