<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hello -<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am a new letterboxer and am enjoying this activity tremendously.  I'm<br/>
&gt; thankful for the Yankee Magazine article which gave your web address and<br/>
&gt; for your amazing web site.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wanted to give you an update on the Crabbing bridge at cheesequake<br/>
&gt; state park letterbox in NJ.  I have successfully found nine letterboxes,<br/>
&gt; but the one at cheesequake has poor or incomplete directions.  I took a<br/>
&gt; first timer with me and we spent 3, rather frustrating,  hours searching<br/>
&gt; for the cement with chains and never found it.  All the other clues up<br/>
&gt; to that point went like clockwork, but I think the clues should be<br/>
&gt; adjusted so the letterbox is findable.  I don't know if you have the<br/>
&gt; ability to contact the planter or not, but if so you may want to suggest<br/>
&gt; an update.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also this weekend, I took my first time letterboxer (now a skeptical<br/>
&gt; letterboxer) to Rock Creek Park in DC.  We found the box with no<br/>
&gt; trouble, but the notebook was a little damp and the rest of the stuff<br/>
&gt; was soaking in it's box.  I tried to clean it up and left my ziplock in<br/>
&gt; place of the ruined one, but it needs a little attention, too.  The<br/>
&gt; letterbox info sheets (which are such a great idea) were almost ruined<br/>
&gt; and dripping.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope this is the right address for this kind of info, but if not,<br/>
&gt; please let me know where to direct it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for being the clearing house for this super hobby.<br/>

                    <html><body>Rebecca, the Cheesequake box seems to be missing. Mary and I were there in April. The cement with chains weren't there but we found a reasonable facsimile (iron posts with a cable across the road, if I remember correctly).  We found the unmarked trail and the two dead birch trees pointing the way. We were able to find the spot where we think the letterbox should have been hidden.  However, the rotting tree jutting into the air at 35 degrees was no longer jutting into the air but was broken into pieces and lying on the ground.  After checking the date it was planted (3/25/00) we figured it had "gone missing."  We did report our finding to the talk list, but haven't heard anything from Maratianmaggot, the planter.
<br/>
<br/>Somewhat disappointing, but a nice trail, nonetheless.

<div>I did put the box back out, but I will check on 
it.  It has a tendency to get pushed down so it's difficult to see and near 
impossible to reach.  Depending on the weather, I might be able to make it 
out there tomorrow night.  I will post whether it is ok.  Priscilla, I 
apologize for not responding to you, but I missed your earlier post.  
Rebecca, the box has been found by others, so the clues will not change.  
Every clue is open to personal interpretation, which is some of the difficulty, 
seeing things as others do.  </div>
