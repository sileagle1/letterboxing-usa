                    <div class="plaintext-content">This would be an off-label use, and as such, because toxins are involved,<br/>
would technically be illegal.  Tho I realize that the cemetery is probably<br/>
trying to discourage gophers and other hole digging critters.  Mothballs are<br/>
napthalene and paradichlorobenzene.  Both of these are toxic and possible<br/>
human carcinogens.  Mothballs have been responsible for deaths to children<br/>
because they look like candy.  Animals probably would steer clear but this<br/>
might not be a great idea if your area has families that letterbox with<br/>
children.  I don't think it would give letterboxing a very good name to have<br/>
something like that hit the media -- Child Killed By Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
In some of the parks and municipalities that do allow letterboxing,<br/>
including toxins in the box might also not exactly be allowed.  Even as an<br/>
adult, I wouldn't want to be handling a box that moisture got into with a<br/>
mothball in there.  Of course, just opening the box and getting a whiff of<br/>
the mothball smell and I'd be walkin' away anyway.  Yuck.  I'd much rather<br/>
just lose an occasional box to animals.<br/>

How about this for a suggestion:  mark your baggies with a permanent <br/>
felt pen.<br/>
<br/>
If you double bag your logbook, mark one bag "Logbook inner" and <br/>
one "Logbook outer".<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, one could be marked "Rubberstamp".<br/>

Maybe this would help people understand how to put it back.<br/>
