                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was out early this morning 'boxing at a local metropark and ran into <br/>
two park rangers apparently scouring the park for letterboxes and <br/>
geocaches with an eye to removing them.  They told me that within the <br/>
last couple of days--a big article on letterboxing ran in our local <br/>
paper two days ago--some people had come into the park digging things <br/>
up looking for a geocache.  You my have noticed a number of posts to <br/>
the list from folks who are anxious to get started, all prompted by <br/>
that article.  Be warned!  Publicity may not be all that beneficial, <br/>
especially when read by those without the appropriate sensitivity to <br/>
the natural areas we all enjoy.<br/>
