was an item left in the box instead of a stamp.  My wife and I <br/>
debated as to whether or not to move the item to our next LB or not, <br/>
as one side of the debate saw it as a variation of a hitchhiker.  <br/>
Ultimately, we did not move the item to a new LB, but are curious to <br/>
know what others would have done in that situation.  We thought it <br/>
may be fun to have a floating item going from one LB to another, but <br/>
others may not feel the same.<br/>

If there was still a log book, but no stamp in the letterbox then it may <br/>
have actually been the victim of  a geocaching mistake. Most geocachers <br/>
know what letterbox's are by now and know to leave them alone, but there <br/>
are still a couple who don't get it.<br/>
<br/>
If this was the case then the geocachers found the box, didn't realize that <br/>
it was actually a letterbox and traded the stamp with something else. Its <br/>
sad to see the stamp was lost, but there isnt a lot that can be done ;-(<br/>
