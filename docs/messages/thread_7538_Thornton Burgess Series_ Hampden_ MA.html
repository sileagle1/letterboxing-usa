                    <html><body>Decided to go hunt these 7 boxes yesterday and just wanted everyone to know what a wonderful hunt it was!!!!!!!!!! Took my 10 and 4 year old, and it held their interest for the 4 hour trek. The storyline was fantastic along with all the clues, and the stamps were delightful.......We packed a picnic lunch and found many forest creatures to play with. You can really tell that these boxes were planted with lots of thought and care. <br/>
Hats off to you!!!!<br/>

PS. The Field Trip Hitchiker visted these boxes as well and is off on another trek with the Tree Fairy I believe..... </body></html>
