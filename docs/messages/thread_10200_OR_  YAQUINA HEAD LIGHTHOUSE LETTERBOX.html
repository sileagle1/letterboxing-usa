Ryan's wonderful nearly drive-by Yaquina Head Lighthouse Letterbox.<br/>
Great job, Ryan!  Those of you interested in hunting this box, if you<br/>
have an annual Golden Eagle Pass for the National Parks it will get you<br/>
in so you don't have to pay the $5.  It was rainy, somewhat windy and<br/>
warm at the coast today. The waves of the Pacific were wild and<br/>
wonderful!  It was a great day to visit the beach.<br/>
<br/>
We had planned to try for Beneath the Blue #2 again, but it was dark by<br/>
the time we got back up to the Beverly Beach area.  One of these days<br/>
maybe we'll get that one.   <br/>
<br/>
We went down on the docks where all the fishing vessels are.  Tons of<br/>
big barking sea lions were wallowing in the water waiting for by catch<br/>
to slide down their way from the back ends of the boats.  Saw<br/>
cormorants, a great blue heron, common murres, and pigeon guillemots<br/>
also.  What a grand day.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Ryan and Funhog (even though we didn't get to hers) for<br/>
placing and giving us the incentive for a Hwy 101 road trip!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
