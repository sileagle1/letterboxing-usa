chilly outdoors to run around in just boots when hiking. Northern <br/>
California was a bit chilly this past week for hiking in the buff, so <br/>
she decided it was time to get dressed. I can't describe her as being <br/>
beautiful or elegant, but she is handsome. She is contemplating on <br/>
her next hunt, old or new will be rewarding!<br/>
