you make sure you get the ENTIRE link.  If you use Yahoo! or Hotmail, the<br/>
link might be cut off.<br/>
<br/>
For instance:<br/>
http://letterboxing.wesgarrison.us/em.asp?a=a&amp;e=wes@wesgarr<br/>
ison.us&amp;blah=blah<br/>
<br/>
Something like this would try to confirm 'wes@wesgarr' , which isn't the<br/>
address I want!<br/>
<br/>
In this case, you'll want to cut 'n paste the first line, then add the<br/>
second line, then press enter in your browser to go to the page.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  I tried to set up my account on the new site.  I entered my email<br/>
  address, password, and name as directed.  I received my email<br/>
  confirmation.  When I clicked on the link to confirm (all within<br/>
  minutes of registering) I was told that my membership account did not<br/>
  exist that I should register again.  When I try to register again I<br/>
  am told that I cannot use my email address because it is already<br/>
  being used by another user.<br/>
<br/>
  what do I do?<br/>
