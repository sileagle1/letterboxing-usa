Floating Feather and I took a hike on Sunday and located your mystery box <br/>
"Huts". It's wet. We dried the book as best we could. Took it out of the <br/>
plastic bag and put it in a new box with dry paper towels between the pages <br/>
in an effort to absorb some of the mosture. We placed new plastic bags <br/>
inside to use once the book is dry.<br/>
This afternoon on the way home from work I located "Link with the Past". <br/>
Great spot. Been there many times and always enjoyed this special location, <br/>
thanks for the extra pleasure this time!!<br/>
Wanda and Pete have been every where!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy Life!! 'Box On !!<br/>
See Joy<br/>
