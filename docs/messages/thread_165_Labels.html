This came in from Adrian a little while ago.  I don't know if you saw this part<br/>
but it seems like the most common sense (and least antagonistic) appraoch:<br/>
<br/>
   "Stick a label inside the lid explaining that the box is put out for<br/>
   many people's pleasure and that taking it or destroying it will cause<br/>
   people wasted time and effort. Include your phone number and tell people<br/>
   to ring you if they want to know more."<br/>
<br/>
I plan to use a label similar to the one above and I hope others will do the<br/>
same.  A label like the one above will help to show what kind of group we are<br/>
and it may also help to stir up a bit of interest in the hobby.  I think the<br/>
best chance we have of showing that we are an open and inclusive group is to<br/>
make the caveat very direct and to include in it (rather than a warning) an<br/>
invitation to find out what we are about and what all the fun is.  This would<br/>
be especially important for kids I think.<br/>

Ps.  I think I will come up with a printable label that you can bring up on<br/>
the web page.  Maybe it would be a nice feature if our logo (what is our logo<br/>
BTW?) and the Kids Corner logo could appear on it.<br/>

This definitely seems like the better approach to me (though I have <br/>
enjoyed reading the curses!)<br/>
