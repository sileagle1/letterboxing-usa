CT. Two Tag-a-Longs<br/>
Added to The Walden Nature Preserve<br/>
Salem CT.<br/>
By Bluebird and Butterfly<br/>
January 25,2003<br/>
<br/>
The Walden Nature Preserve deserves some praise. It is so varied and <br/>
interesting that<br/>
Bluebird and Butterfly decided to lure you there by adding two tag along <br/>
letterboxes to<br/>
the Tree Stump Box that is cleverly planted by Carol and friends.<br/>
The hike follows the same directions as the Walden Nature Preserve Clues.<br/>
This Preserve begins very low key and shyly shows off its beauty of <br/>
rocks , forest., fields,<br/>
and a river. What more could a hiker want?? ~~ Perhaps some letterboxes <br/>
?? O.K.<br/>
Follow the clues for the Tree Stump Box and stamp Bee Happy , then <br/>
continue on the<br/>
yellow trail. Soon you notice a trail turning left marked with pink <br/>
discs. We want to<br/>
investigate that trail next. but now you turn right onto Red. Watch for <br/>
a large and<br/>
wonderful Riding Tree. on your right. If you can, jump up onto it and <br/>
have an imaginary<br/>
ride off into the forest. Look quickly for a stump due north. quite <br/>
close. Go Batty The<br/>
bat from Kids Day has taken up residence here. Stamp in even if you have <br/>
before,<br/>
because this is a new Hiding spot. Then off you go, continuing on the <br/>
red trail. As it<br/>
breaks out of the woods into the edge of a field, you stay right on the <br/>
red. [it also goes<br/>
straight ?] Over the river once again, watch for a huge rock on your <br/>
left. The foundations<br/>
are near. After passing the rock, climb the mound to a paved plateau and <br/>
walk through the<br/>
small pine trees, turning right and face the two standing cement <br/>
uprights. Look under the<br/>
west facing foundation for the Big Rock Letterbox. Stamp in and be <br/>
careful to hide out of<br/>
sight. Tuck a rock in front of the box and continue on the red trail <br/>
back to your car.<br/>
Pretty place, Huh??<br/>
