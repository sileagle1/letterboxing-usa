<br/>
Eagle Bob and I will be going after the Pulpit Rock and Pinnacle <br/>
Letterboxes tomorrow, Sunday, August 8th.  But wait, the plot <br/>
thickens. There is an observatory up there where I shall stash a <br/>
letterbox, giving us 3 to hunt for. Or, you can credit for a plant. <br/>
The stamp is carved and ready to go! I'll also be unveiling a new <br/>
improved Lightnin' Bug stamp!<br/>
<br/>
What we are looking for people that may wish to partake in this <br/>
rather strenuous hike. It can be anywhere from 6-9 miles, depending <br/>
upon which shortcuts you take (each one shaves about 1.5 miles from <br/>
the roud trip). There is also about a 1100 ft elevation gain. I'd <br/>
urge that little kiddies be left at home and sturdy shoes be worn <br/>
(boots, not sandals). This is one of the most spectacular views in <br/>
eastern, PA, so bringing a camera or binoculars is a must!<br/>
<br/>
Please respond by email if interested and I'll provide the meeting <br/>
places and times.  I'll check around 7 pm tonight one final time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Lightnin' Bug Itchin' to do some seriously fun hiking!<br/>
