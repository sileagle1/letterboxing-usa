I was there a few months ago (pre-blizzard) and was unable to find <br/>
it. Pretty sure I was in the right location. Spent quite awhile <br/>
searching with no luck.<br/>

Same here; couldn't find it in early March.  At that time, I e-mailed <br/>
the planter, MissyB, who said several people had reported it <br/>
missing.  She had planned to contact the webmasters to have it <br/>
removed from the site.<br/>
