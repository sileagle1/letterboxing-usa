                    <div class="plaintext-content">I guess this idea has been going around -- to gather up the stamp<br/>
images which will be submitted for the Dartmoor walk, and put them<br/>
on virtual review here on the web page.  Can you tell me what you<br/>
think about it?  It would be interesting to hear from some of you<br/>
who don't even have stamps yet.  Would it be fun to see what some<br/>
of the stamps that are submitted look like - perhaps for ideas on<br/>
what to do for a stamp?<br/>
<br/>
Also, are you aware that stamps can be made by machine, which<br/>
is how the stamps for the Dartmoor walk are being reproduced?  I<br/>
think they can turn out rather nice.  My first stamp was done that<br/>
way from a drawing which I traced from some clip art I got from<br/>
the web.  I mailed it off to this lady who makes rubber stamps<br/>
by machine.  I think it cost 12.00, but I've heard you can have it<br/>
done much more cheaply than that, esp. if you order several at a<br/>
time.  I suppose we could provide a service whereby if the clip-<br/>
art is sent in, or if a link to it is provided (along with the<br/>
dimensions desired), then when there is a full sheet of stamps I<br/>
could send them in to one of these stamp makers and save quite a<br/>
bit of money.  Instead of 12.00/stamp I think it would be around<br/>
3.00/stamp.  Add that to .50 for an air-tight jar and a small price<br/>
for a small Rite in the Rain (water-proof) notebook and maybe you'd<br/>
be looking at around $6.00-7.00 for a complete letterbox, and you<br/>
wouldn't have to be particularly artistic to create one.<br/>
<br/>
I do not mean to fly in the face of art or pure hand-carved stamp<br/>
making.  I really appreciate the artistic element.  I even consider<br/>
it when putting up maps and clues on the web page.  But I also<br/>
realize some of us are not artists and I wonder how many people<br/>
may benefit by some of the alrternative methods available for<br/>
making a stamp.  Stamps can still be original and look nice and<br/>
even be disired as collectables if done this way.<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking out loud...<br/>
Please let me know if I am stepping on toes here, esp.the "stamp-<br/>
carving purists".  I don't know.  I certainly don't mean to do that.<br/>
I'm carving my own right now actually.  I'm just wondering if there<br/>
are ways to preserve the artistic element other than hand-carving.<br/>
If the emphasis goes to art, why not explore the different mediums<br/>
available, not just the different material mediums but different<br/>
processes?<br/>
<br/>
Also, why not have a clip art page to just select from for a <br/>
stamp to be made?  Then again, you could just send in a picture.<br/>
And there's always the option of finding a kind soul who would be<br/>
willing to carve a stamp for you based on a drawing or clip art.<br/>
This would have to be premised by approval from the carver as some<br/>
things are too difficult or too impractical to carve by hand.<br/>
Another thing that was previously mentioned is to hand carve your<br/>
own very basic image.  I think Bonita McLaughlin's stamp images at<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/wendell.htm<br/>
and Rachel's stamp image at<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/evanston.htm<br/>
are fine examples of this.<br/>
<br/>
I like to mention again (and reemphasize) that publicizing<br/>
a stamp image is strictly voluntary.  I think its neat how Steven<br/>
Starry puts his stamp AND a photo of the letterbox location up, see:<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/sturgeon.htm<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/minkrivr.htm<br/>
I think that's really cool.  But I also like Randy Hall's clues page:<br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box2.html<br/>
Here the map is quite vague, but artistic and the stamp image...<br/>
well, if you want to see this stamp you'd better put on your boots<br/>
and grab your compass.<br/>
<br/>
Just thinking out loud...  As always, comments are welcome.<br/>

&gt;  Please let me know if I am stepping on toes here, esp.the "stamp-<br/>

<br/>
I don't want to speak for everyone, but as a self-professed Purist, let me<br/>
just say that I have no objections or prejudices where machine-made stamps are<br/>
concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the die-hard stamp-carvers are first and foremost rubber stamp people,<br/>
in general.  I am a bit of a rubber stamp lunatic, myself... and by far, most<br/>
of my collection of stamps is of the manufactured variety.  For Americans,<br/>
Letterboxing is a melding of traits from the hikers/orienteers/scouts on one<br/>
hand, and the mail/paper/dada Artists, on the other.  The artists in the group<br/>
are likely to be hip on all aspects of rubber stamp graphics.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I suppose we could provide a service whereby if the clip-<br/>
&gt;  art is sent in, or if a link to it is provided (along with the<br/>
&gt;  dimensions desired), then when there is a full sheet of stamps I<br/>
&gt;  could send them in to one of these stamp makers and save quite a<br/>
&gt;  bit of money.<br/>
<br/>
A custom-lettered manufactured stamp with clip-art graphics is much nicer than<br/>
a stock stamp design off the shelf.  If we can make custom stamps less<br/>
expensive, I think we should do so.  It is my understanding that some<br/>
companies drop their prices even more if you reorder a previous design.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to participate in a 'Stamp-Pool' of this sort.<br/>
<br/>
Madly yours,<br/>

am hardly one to object to any process that makes their creation<br/>
cheaper and easier.  However, now that I have carved a few tiny pink<br/>
erasers into something pretty stamp-like and cool looking, I can see<br/>
how one can derive great satisfaction from the artistic process<br/>
involved.  (Except for that time I stuck the tip of the exacto knife<br/>
in my thumb, that wasn't so cool...)  As before though, the great<br/>
thing we have going here is everyone participates in their own<br/>
particular way.  Hand-carved or machine-made makes no difference so<br/>
long as we're having fun.<br/>

hand-carved to be beautiful or artistic.<br/>
<br/>
What is far more important, IMHO, is that the stamp somehow be unique to<br/>
the letterbox and its location. This can be accomplished by getting a<br/>
clip art image, and adding some  "postmark" text, as Adrian has done to<br/>
the Prayer Rock Stamp. This avoids the need to feel "artistic" in terms<br/>
of carving skills, etc., yet, the art really is in the image selection<br/>
and text combination.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I seem to remember somebody finding a low-cost source for stamps<br/>
of the "postmark" design? Well,why not have one of these made, and<br/>
include the clip art stamp as a second stamp in the box - the finder<br/>
could then combine the two as a single image in their book, could use<br/>
different color ink pads, etc. The "artistic process" thus becomes a<br/>
collaboration the finder and the original "artist." <br/>
