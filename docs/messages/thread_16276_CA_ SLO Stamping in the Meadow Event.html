                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a great success was the "SLO Stamping in the Meadow" gathering!  <br/>
Over 30 letterboxers attended the festivitiesand this is CALIFORNIA, <br/>
not Maine; there ain't all that many letterboxers out here.  We had <br/>
food, drawings for prizes, beautifully carved Event Stamps-and <br/>
twenty hidden letterboxes for us to find (goody-goody, love finding <br/>
letterboxes)!!  The gracious hosts who put together this wonderful <br/>
event:  Sir Balthazar, JugglerMouse, and Ash Raven.  While I am not a <br/>
party planner myself, I know that taking on the responsibility of <br/>
throwing the first ever "Lower California" letterboxing event was <br/>
surely a daunting task, requiring many hours of work, planning, and <br/>
far too much stress.  Alas, Ash Raven wasn't able to attend most of <br/>
the event since, unlike the rest of us, she was acting like a <br/>
responsible adult and attending classes-on a Saturday, no less!  <br/>
Nonetheless, Ash was able to attend at the end of the event, and <br/>
helped to gather up letterboxes, and resurrect Sir B's shattered <br/>
multi-colored stamp pad; however, she carved and wrote clues for a <br/>
number of the event's planted letterboxes, including "The Coke <br/>
Bottle"one of the favorite stampbook images in my collection.  <br/>
JugglerMouse manned the grill . . . ummm . . . I mean "womaned" the <br/>
grill, as well as welcoming guests.  Of the 80-plus stamp images in <br/>
my book, each of which I love, I think that JugglerMouse's are the <br/>
most beautiful (apparently she makes good use of those micron-sized <br/>
gouges shown to me by Sir B.).  Sir Balthazar was the letterboxing <br/>
equivalent of Jay Gatsbyeverywhere at once, graciously greeting <br/>
guests, conducting cheese races, exhibiting fake rocks and military <br/>
compasses, choreographing group photos, and generally making everyone <br/>
feel at home.  Sir B., JugglerMouse, Ash Raven and their googled <br/>
friends set a very high standard for stamp carving, clue writing, and <br/>
producing letterbox events.<br/>

Thank you, Buzzard! Ms. Ash worked hard at planning, carving, writing <br/>
clues and placing boxes. It was very kind of you to notice. Thanks <br/>
also to Princess Lea who would not leave the event until she had met <br/>
Ash Raven. <br/>
<br/>

&gt; most beautiful (apparently she makes good use of those micron-sized <br/>
&gt; gouges shown to me by Sir B.).  <br/>
<br/>
Actually JugglerMouse makes do with the regular Speedball Carving <br/>
set. We are almost afraid to see how beautifully she would carve with <br/>
a micro-carving set.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sir Balthazar was the letterboxing <br/>

<br/>
Okay, I was thinking of having Sean Connery play me in the movie but <br/>
Robert Redford can do it if he wants. Here in East Egg, we plant the <br/>
letterboxes all around the manse. Tell Daisy she can get that special <br/>
stamp later.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hey, our next event will be even better. I promise not to worry quite <br/>
so much. We are thinking of maybe El Chorro Park where folk can camp. <br/>
And the event will probably center around Loteria. Hope to get more <br/>
folks into carving and planting the stamps. <br/>
<br/>
Buzzard helped make all of this possible. Guess we have to come down <br/>
south and get some plants and finds in there, too.<br/>
<br/>
More in a bit,<br/>

I cannot top all those thank yous-  but thanks again.<br/>
Sorry Team MCJONES were such a mess but with children/camping and <br/>
this being our first event we did not know our heads from our tails <br/>
or the stamp from the pad! But we found some great stamps. You where <br/>
all very nice and patient with us. I will be better prepared next <br/>
time. We had a nice camp out in De Oro. We got the GSD Harry Potter <br/>
series and one more of Juggermouse series in Morro Bay on Sunday and <br/>
then high tailed it home as it was a school night.<br/>

I know there aren't really any "rules" but I didn't feel quite right exchan=<br/>
ging stamps <br/>
with her unless I'd actually met her!  Plus it's hard to get me to leave th=<br/>
ese events.....<br/>
<br/>
I had a wonderful weekend and have to pile on my thanks to the Googled Gang=<br/>
 for <br/>
going above and beyond for our enjoyment.  I came down Route 1 on Friday an=<br/>
d <br/>
picked up several of the boxes along the Way (Sit Rep coming soon).  The da=<br/>
y after <br/>
the event was spent with Ryan climbing Bishop's Peak in search of that wand=<br/>
ering cow <br/>
of his.  He was very patient and kind to stop every 10 feet or so while I c=<br/>
aught my <br/>
breath (I'm not quite up to AT shape just now).  We had a message on the wi=<br/>
ndshield <br/>
when we came back to the car from Buzzard, who had been in the area (search=<br/>
ing for <br/>
Triss from the Redwall series, I would guess) - thought that was funny that=<br/>
 he <br/>
recognized my car!<br/>
<br/>
Glad the new boxes I planted in the area already have found their audience!=<br/>
  Also glad <br/>
to hear that the stamp at the store will be there for a while since I could=<br/>
n't quite find <br/>
the time to squeeze that one in to get downtown this time around.  But I'll=<br/>
 be back in <br/>
December - hope there will be lots of new stuff to find at that time!<br/>
