awesome. 3 days before the clean-up, I had only 6 people coming. Then <br/>
I recieved a phone call from a girl from the local school. She said 10-<br/>
15 people will be coming from the school. Well, not everyone came but <br/>
there was still a dozen or more people that showed up. I have never <br/>
been happier. I just need to thank everyone that came to help out. <br/>
Uneksia, GreenthunbNH, Fibrohugs, Little Man, Little Lady, Wimpy, and <br/>
of course Rubaduc. Thanks again. Project White Sands was a huge <br/>
success. I thank you, Pembroke thanks you, and the state of New <br/>
Hampshire thanks you. Rock on in the granite state.<br/>
