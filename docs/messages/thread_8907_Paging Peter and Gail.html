                    <div class="plaintext-content">So it has not been a banner week for me!  I was informed that our <br/>
Cuckoo Clue has an error in it and now I don't know where the second <br/>
set of clues is. (and since I know I just confused everyone, yes, we <br/>
put out two identical sets of clues)<br/>
<br/>
The last people to stamp into the box where the Cuckoo Clue was <br/>
stashed were Peter and Gail.  So, Peter and Gail, if you read this, <br/>
and you have the Cuckoo Clue, please e-mail us at adglbna@aol.com. <br/>
(or just drop us a note anyway!) If someone else has the clue, please <br/>
change the bearing on the clue from 30 to 180(due South)and drop us <br/>
an e-mail!<br/>
<br/>
Apologies,<br/>
