Could you possibly add a note at the bottom of the clues which state that <br/>
one can also reach Wolf Trap by heading west on Rte 7 from Tysons to Reston. <br/>
  Turn at the light into Shouse Village (there are pretty good signs for <br/>
Wolf Trap off of Route 7).  You can also take Beulah Road from Maple Ave. <br/>
Vienna up toward Wolf Trap.  Continue straight at the four way stop.  At the <br/>
next light take a left.  Pass the Barns of Wolf Trap and the entrance to the <br/>
Dulles Toll Road.  Wolf Trap is on the right hand side.  It has a very big <br/>
sign.<br/>
<br/>
The Wolf Trap exit from the Dulles Toll Road is sometimes restricted.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I noticed that the format gets messed up copying from Microsoft Word <br/>
into the email.  Is it better to do an attachment?  Any suggestions?  Thanks <br/>
