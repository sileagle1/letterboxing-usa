I am new to letterboxing, and bought a stamp.  I would like to make my <br/>
own.  I know there is a lot of information about carving etc.  I would <br/>
like to know is it better to use linoleum or a rubber eraser?  <br/>

this. Erasers are a good place to start. I use PZ cut<br/>
grade B for all my carving now. It's available from<br/>
Stampeze. Cheap and great service.<br/>
