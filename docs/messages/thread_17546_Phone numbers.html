&gt; In the "Getting Started" section of LB.org, it is mentioned to put <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I may be way off here, but the getting started section was conceived<br/>
of by the Vermont Viking when boxing was just starting up. In a short<br/>
amount of time (6 years or so) boxing has evolved all over the country<br/>
and beyond. The getting started section just like boxing in general<br/>
with its vague "no rules" philosophy was really meant as a guideline.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have never left my phone number and would never think of<br/>
doing such a thing. I suppose an email is not that much different<br/>
these days, but it's a matter of personal preference in this case.<br/>
<br/>
Once you put your box/clue/log out there on the web consider it public<br/>
domain and treat it the way you would if you were publishing your own<br/>
name. That's just my own experience on this subject.<br/>
<br/>
I've always found all the information by the VV and Mapsurfer<br/>
including the most recent "Letterboxer's Companion" to be a fantastic<br/>
starting point for those starting the game. You might also just visit<br/>
lots of boxes, I've also found that seeing different variations of how<br/>
people assemble their boxes and logs is the best way to get a feel for<br/>
how it works. Best of luck! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those founders of this hobby for putting that information<br/>
out there - you folks have contributed greatly to letterboxing. <br/>

Sue and I do not include phone numbers or address, but I do include my email address. We appreciate when we receive an email stating that our box is ok or there is a problem.<br/>
<br/>
One of the main factors, as I see it, is to keep those new letterboxers and veterans interested and have them remain with us over the years. There has been very disappointing "turn over" as people have left this group. I feel it is the duty of all of us to keep this game interesting, fun, maybe not so public [word of mouth clues, bonus boxes, etc.] and most of all civil. Let's see this thing go back to the mystery that initally shrouded it.<br/>

Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

<br/>
If you don't mind me asking, why?  I've heard people say they <br/>
wouldn't do it, but I've never really gotten a real answer.<br/>
<br/>
Granted, I can understand a female with an obviously feminine handle <br/>
not wanting to give out numbers, but that's part of society.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just curious why people wouldn't want to put a number on their <br/>
box and if there had ever been any problems in doing so.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, we've been boxing for over a year and half.  Mostly, though, we <br/>
go after geocaches.  When we started we grabbed all of the boxes in <br/>
our area in no time.  We then found caching and have gone from <br/>
there.  We've got out a few hybrids and planning some that are closer <br/>
to a true letterbox without giving the cachers a different road to <br/>
follow.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, like the more underground aspect of boxing.  Caching is <br/>
getting so commercial and regulated it's unreal.<br/>

Sorry to hear that. The truth is that there is no "real" answer. It is<br/>
defined in how you perceive boxing and rules and society in general.<br/>
My personal preference is that the less information avaiable the<br/>
better. If someone has gone to great lengths to search for a worthy<br/>
box then they deserve the "finders gift" of a bonus-box (kudos TGD and<br/>
DrewClan,etc) because they have earned it....end]<br/>

<br/>
I recieved a nasty e-mail about one of my boxes.  The person had either found my box or got my e-mail from the letterboxing.org site.<br/>
<br/>
It was a very odd and somewhat disturbing message.  The box was named after a Native American tribe and it sounded like the person who wrote it thought I was a member of that tribe. The e-mail threatened physical harm.  I knew that the message was not really intended for me because someone elses name was mentioned as the target of the threat.<br/>
<br/>
So, the reason I don't put my phone number is two-fold:<br/>
1)  It is much easier to delete a nasty e-mail and put that person in your spam filter as an automatic delete than it is to ignore someone calling you or leaving messages on your machine.  I would hate to have had the above individual have my phone number.<br/>
2)  Even if your number is unlisted, it is possible to get a name and address using a reverse lookup.  My number is unlisted but when I put it into a reverse lookup, my name and home address come up.  If the above individual had my home info, I may not be have been around to send this e-mail today.<br/>

I guess my question would be the opposite--Why WOULD you want to put your<br/>
number on it?  After all, there is minimal control over who will find the<br/>
box, particularly if you place it out in public.  Yes, there are steps you<br/>
can take to minimize the chance of accidental exposure, but still...I would<br/>
rather make the pychos work a bit to find me.<br/>
<br/>
And, with most issues--this is purely a personal preference.<br/>

<br/>
Because it is my box and if someone is not going to leave it, doesn't <br/>
understand what this is all about, or wants the box off his land, <br/>
then a phone number is easier for just about anyone to use, and more <br/>
immediate, than email.  So basically, it's convenience of the <br/>
accidental finder/landowner.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, the only box that I have had to come up missing had had <br/>
the number on the outside, but the label had come off and was put on <br/>
the inside.  I had not had a chance to get back to replace it before <br/>
it came up missing.  I've not heard anything from it.  Fat lot good <br/>
the number did me, right?<br/>
<br/>
The whole argument of permission and hiding aside, it shows any <br/>
authority that you are serious about taking ownership and <br/>
responsibility of the box.<br/>
<br/>
While I haven't heard of any boxes getting blown up by the bombsquad, <br/>
I'm willing to bet some tense situations in the caching world could <br/>
have been prevented if it was clearly marked and had some information <br/>
on it that allowed realtime contact with the owners.<br/>
<br/>
Don't get me wrong.  I'm only asking how many people do it and what's <br/>
the reason behind the choice if not.  I'm not wagging fingers or <br/>
anything.  We don't need any more rules!<br/>
