                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you Boxdn, and others, for your word of welcome.  I appreciate the <br/>
encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
I am on Whidbey Island, Washington, where I am a Girl Scouts and 4-H leader, <br/>
among the other hats I wear.  I heard about letterboxing from another Girl <br/>
Scout leader, and was intrigued because it seemed something my troop would <br/>
like to do.  It's proven to be great fun for my daughter and me, and it gets <br/>
her out enjoying hikes, which was a challenge to encourage before.  We've <br/>
been reading everything we can find to get our questions answered, and it's <br/>
all very interesting.  I'm also an artist, and have been studying the <br/>
Thunderbird myth and how it's found in a wide range of Native American <br/>
cultures, not just here in the Northwest.  My daughter and I have been <br/>
carving away at stamps and plotting our next adventure.<br/>
<br/>
So, that's me, in a nutshell.  I'm looking forward to getting to know more <br/>
folks like you.<br/>

Well in a nut shell (no-pun) I live in New Orleans,LA and found out <br/>
about Lbn' by accident surfing internet, way back in Dec.00. This <br/>
hobby interested me cause of my art schooling, scouting, and love of <br/>
the outdoors and besides with a name like "Boxed In" I was destin to <br/>
do this.<br/>
