know, I am sure it was me being whiney when I should have been wine-<br/>
y! HEY idea, SLO needs some wine-ery-Letterboxes! My restiction you <br/>
have to drink some wine? <br/>
<br/>
I just love the simplicity of letterboxing  I hope  it does not get <br/>
to complex. Simple things are wonderful in this complex world.  It <br/>
is nice to take my stamp and fetch others. I am fully inspired and I <br/>
won some media to carve and plant some boxes but now to find the <br/>
time. Did any of you get that my hubby was so clueless about winning <br/>
the erasers, he thought they would be good for my daughters <br/>
homework....<br/>
<br/>
On another note: I wonder if sir B can post those clues from the SLO <br/>
event! Or has he and I mised it? Or send me one? My page got all <br/>
wrinkled in my excitement! I would like a fresh one for my books.<br/>
<br/>
MADDOG..feeling better now. <br/>

Ugh!  But I haaaaate (imagine me saying that in my whiniest voice) <br/>
wine!  =)  <br/>

Seriously, though, I do think that's a great idea.  SLO and the <br/>
Central Coast are known for their wineries, and it would make sense <br/>
to have a wine-themed series.  (But it's true, I really don't like <br/>
the stuff!)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, I've had that idea, too - for the Finger Lakes wineries here in <br/>
west-central New York;  but I haven't done anything about it yet - <br/>
maybe next year. They're divided into several districts or "Trails", <br/>
associated with Cayuga, Seneca, and Keuka Lakes, so it would involve <br/>
a sampling of each Trail.  Have to get permission at each, of <br/>
course;  couldn't very well be done surreptitiously on those private <br/>
premises.  Don't know as I'd insist on the suggested "you must taste" <br/>
restriction, altho it has its merits.  I like the stuff myself, <br/>
unlike Ryan, and have several carboys a-bubblin' away in the laundry.<br/>
