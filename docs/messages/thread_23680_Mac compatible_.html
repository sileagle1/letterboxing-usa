the flah to the far right of the box we attempted, and marked it as an <br/>
attempt, &amp; contacted the placer...but when I go to the clues page I do not <br/>
see any icons there to track my experience with that LB.  And, when I look <br/>
under my own prefernces the list does not include any boxes--the one I had <br/>

Is this site Mac compatible?<br/>

Most places that look funky or plain don't work will display fine with the<br/>
latest version of Firefox - a browser for us Mac people that is still being<br/>
upgraded and improved. Its also free and has a few neat features that<br/>
Explorer doesn't. I find myself having to use both though, and just know<br/>
that if a site won't work in one, it generally will in the other.<br/>

I wouldn't say this is the fault of webmasters not supporting Mac, but<br/>
rather blame Microsoft for not supporting Macs. Atlas Quest doesn't<br/>
work well with IE for Macs, but it's not because there's any code that<br/>
"breaks" Mac applications. AQ just uses standard HTML, CSS, and<br/>
JavaScript--and that last version of IE for Macs doesn't support the<br/>
standards very well! (Actually, truth be told, IE for Windows doesn't<br/>
support standards very well either, but it's still significantly<br/>
better than IE for Mac! I'm hoping and praying that IE 7 will fix<br/>
their dreadful lack of support for standards, but I haven't looked<br/>
into it much yet.)<br/>
<br/>
My point being, blame the browser, not the operating system or the<br/>
webmasters. =)<br/>
<br/>
If you want my opinion, you should just uninstall IE for Macs because<br/>
over time, fewer and fewer websites will work correctly with it. =)<br/>
Save yourself the trouble and start relying on FireFox or Safari which<br/>
seem to be the two most popular options for Macs and both do a great<br/>
job of supporting standards.<br/>
