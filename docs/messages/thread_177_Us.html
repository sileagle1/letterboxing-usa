The talk list keeps growing.  There are about 15 new members in the last 2<br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
I think its in order to give a brief introduction for the benfit of new<br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing USA started last March-April as an answer to a growing interest<br/>
in letterboxing in the U.S.  (Letterboxing originated in Dartmoor, England.)<br/>
<br/>
Is it safe to assume you all have at least visited the web site at:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/ <br/>
??<br/>
<br/>
If not, please go there and have a look around.  It will answer a great many<br/>
of your detailed questions, esp. for Getting Started.<br/>
<br/>
We are a loose, informal, non-profit group with an open philosophy about<br/>
letterboxing.  While some of the clues are a bit clever, they are all open,<br/>
solvable, and out there for your fun.  Some have compass bearings and strict<br/>
directions while others are a bit more intuitive.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free, once you have started, to contact this group to have questions<br/>
answered.  Contact me to have your clues posted to our site.<br/>
<br/>
I am at (email addy)<br/>
mailto:elf@pclink.com<br/>
<br/>
Ps.  We all have a sense of ownership of this site.  Everyone here has<br/>
contributed something to the creation of it, either in ideas or resources<br/>
(or sometimes in saying nothing).<br/>
Feel free to act in kind, &amp; stay involved at whatever level works for you.<br/>
I speak for everyone when I say, "Welcome!"<br/>
