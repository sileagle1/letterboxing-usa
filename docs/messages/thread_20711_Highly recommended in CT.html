I'm sure most folks in CT are justifiably concentrating their autumn <br/>
boxing in the Mansfield area, but I've just got to point out a <br/>
wonderful new letterbox by some new friends. When I first met this <br/>
couple in Salem, I was struck by how much they were obviously in <br/>
love. It's kinda like when you see Warrior Woman these days: that <br/>
sparkley happy excited delight that just bubbles out and makes <br/>
everyone else all breathless and goose pimply and a little jealous. <br/>
There's just something thrilling about lovers. It was only later that <br/>
I learned that this couple goes by the fitting trailname "The <br/>
Lovers." Anyway, be sure to check out The Salem Star Donkey, and not <br/>
just because of the embarassing dedication at the beginning of the <br/>
clues. This one is a "how to" lesson in great boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Lovers! Jay in CT<br/>
