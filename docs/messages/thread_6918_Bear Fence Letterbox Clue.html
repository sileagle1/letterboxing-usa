<br/>
Location: Shenandoah Nat'l Park, Rappahannock County, Virginia<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: The trail itself is only a 0.8 mile loop but there is a <br/>
lot of rock scrambling/climbing.  This box should ONLY be sought <br/>
after by those who are sure footed, wearing good shoes, and are not <br/>
afraid of heights.  This trail is NOT recommended in rainy/snowy <br/>
weather as the rocks can be slippery and the trail is at a good <br/>
elevation.<br/>
<br/>
Necessities: Good shoes, $10 entrance fee, compass, and of course, <br/>
your stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Interesting things:  This is one of our favorite trails; it just so <br/>
happened that on this trip to plant our letterbox, my now-fiance <br/>
asked me to marry him!  You will soon see why it was just the perfect <br/>
spot!  We also saw a total of 7 black bears throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
And so the hunt begins...<br/>
Start your quest by entering Skyline Drive in Shenandoah National <br/>
Park.  The entrance fee is $10, but we recommend that you shoot for <br/>
the $20 season pass if the park is accessible to you.  This <br/>
particular trail is great fun and there are plenty others that will <br/>
keep you coming back and are perfect for the family or the dedicated <br/>
hiker.<br/>
<br/>
Pick up a map/guide from the ranger upon entering the park.  The Bear <br/>
Fence trail is located near the 55-mile mark on Skyline Drive and is <br/>
well noted on the map.  If you are entering the park from the North <br/>
or Thornton Gap Entrances you must drive south (north, of course, if <br/>
you enter from the South Entrance).<br/>
<br/>
The trail begins directly across from the parking lot for Bear <br/>
Fence.  Once you begin up the incline, you will see your first <br/>
milepost and note that you are crossing over the Appalachian Trail.  <br/>
Continue toward the Bear Fence Rock Scramble.  As you follow the <br/>
trail and begin climbing over rocks, you may have to keep your eyes <br/>
out for the blue trail blazes to stay on track... But don't worry, <br/>
it's marked very well.<br/>
<br/>
At the scramble's climax you will be treated to an awe-inspiring 360 <br/>
degree view of the mountain chain and valley.  It is really just <br/>
beautiful so take your time and please be careful.  Once you have had <br/>
your fill, continue on the trail.  You will climb a few more rocks on <br/>
your way down.<br/>
<br/>
When you reach the second mile post, do an about-face.  Take 10 steps <br/>
forward.  Turn to 90 degrees and walk up the rocks to the top of the <br/>
ridge.  To your right is a large boulder covered in some brush.  You <br/>
will find the letterbox under a flat rock, under the boulder.  Please <br/>
enjoy our stamp, leave yours, and return the box as you found it.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get back to the mile post on the trail you have two options: <br/>
you can continue on the loop by heading toward the left or link up <br/>
with the Appalachian trail to the right, which will return you to the <br/>
first mile post you saw.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of other trails to check out in the Shenandoah and <br/>
campsites/lodges are available in several locations from early spring <br/>
to mid-fall for reasonable fees.  Thank you for visiting our <br/>
letterbox and enjoy the rest of your trip to Skyline Drive and <br/>
Shenandoah National Park.<br/>
