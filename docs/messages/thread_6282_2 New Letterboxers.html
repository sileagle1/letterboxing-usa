                    <html><body><p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Â We read the article that was in the Virginian-Pilot newspaper last week and decided to give it a try. So on Saturday my 8 year old son and I set out to find some. We visited St. Paul's cannonball first and found it to be a very successful hunt. The stamp is wonderful! There we met Babycatcher and her family and bevyg. They all stamped our books and we stamped there's. Then we went to Hermitage Hermits and ran into bevyg again. The Hermitage is a wonderful place- I had never been there before even though it's right down the strret from me. We toured the museun and enjoyed the pottery show going on in the yard.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Virginian-Pilot for running the article. I've already told a number of other folks about this and hope to let more know. We're also using this to help my son with some of his Cub Scout requirements.</p>
<p>We're thinking about setting out our own box, soon.</p>
