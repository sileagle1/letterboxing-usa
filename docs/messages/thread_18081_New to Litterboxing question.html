<br/>
You also have to be aware that geo-splashers may mistake your box for one of theirs and you will have to dry out the contents of your box after a visit from one.<br/>
<br/>
Some people will say that you shouldn't place a litterbox someplace where you can't maintain it but there are self-cleaning litterboxes that should take care of that problem.<br/>

Just make sure Tabby's been shooed out of the litterbox before you take <br/>
it out to hide it. Forget that step and you won't much like the <br/>
results, nor will the folks who find and open the litterbox a few <br/>
months from now......<br/>

  &gt; I just started litterboxing this week.<br/>
<br/>
  We generally frown on 'litterboxing', but we're all big fans <br/>
  of 'letterboxing', so if you're interested in that, you've come to <br/>
  the right place!  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; My question is: what kind of litterboxing containers work best?<br/>
<br/>
  Unless you live in an area completely devoid of letterboxes, I'd <br/>
  suggest finding a few to see what they're like and how they're put <br/>
  together before trying to create some boxes of your own.  You'll <br/>
  start developing a good sense about what makes a good box and good <br/>
  places to hide them.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; Also, isn't there a problem with non-litterboxers finding them from <br/>
  &gt; the smell?<br/>
<br/>
  You letterboxes shouldn't be smelling at all.  If you've been using a <br/>
  container for food, it's probably a bad idea to turn it into a <br/>
  letterbox for that very reason.  <br/>
<br/>
  Farewell!<br/>

&gt;Just make sure Tabby's been shooed out of the litterbox before you take<br/>
&gt;it out to hide it. Forget that step and you won't much like the<br/>
&gt;results, nor will the folks who find and open the litterbox a few<br/>
&gt;months from now......<br/>
