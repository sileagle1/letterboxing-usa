I'm thinking of those Rubbermaid magazine ads where supposedly real<br/>
people show how Rubbermaid containers helped them to survive disasters<br/>
or were the only things that survived disasters. I remember one where<br/>
the people made an igloo to shelter them during a freak blizzard by<br/>
packing the snow in their large Rubbermaid totes and forming blocks,<br/>
which they then stacked.<br/>
