Hi folks! Hope you all had nice holidays, whatever your <br/>
religious preferences!<br/>
<br/>
I've been getting a chuckle or two out of the all the comments <br/>
about retired boxes, LBNA vs AQ, and the proliferation of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
About those retired boxes... <br/>
- Do they get Social Security...? <br/>
      ... a pension? <br/>
      ... American Association of Retired Letterboxes benefits?<br/>
- Will the retired boxes move south to GA or FL?<br/>
      (Both places have LOTS of space for more boxes!)<br/>
<br/>
About LBNA vs AtlasQuest...<br/>
- I personally like all the bells and whistles that Ryan has<br/>
   added to AQ! I've listed all of my plants on both sites, though<br/>
   the last three link directly from LNBA to AQ (one of those<br/>
   links further on to my own site because neither site provides<br/>
   downloadability).<br/>
- I've added every box I've found to my virtual logbook on AQ...<br/>
   and if a box is not listed there, I'll contact the owner and ask<br/>
   them to list it on AQ. Some have kindly added their box(es),<br/>
   some have not (you know who you are!).<br/>
- I like the simplicity of the LBNA site. I always check it<br/>
   first for new boxes. If there was a virtual logbook (just for Finds)<br/>
   on LBNA.org, I think everybody would be happily adding their <br/>
   finds to it!<br/>
<br/>
About Letterboxes Breeding like Rabbits...<br/>
- I still chuckle when I recall that post about CT LBXers running<br/>
   out of trees and rocks to use for hiding places... heeheehee...<br/>
- New England LBXers have an unfair advantage: all those old<br/>
   stone walls! I'm not crying foul... I grew up in RI... and I've got<br/>
   a box or two to plant in a stone wall or two on my next visit!<br/>
- Florida has plenty of trees, but rocks seem to be absent...<br/>
- compared to other states, GA has done a miserable job <br/>
   reserving land for public use. Especially the county I live in!<br/>
- It's truly amazing how many letterboxes are planted every day.<br/>
   I wish more were planted near me!<br/>
- Someday it'll be a matter of deciding which boxes to NOT go <br/>
   find on a given weekend!<br/>
- I can't wait for this scenario: you go out into the woods... find<br/>
   a great location to hide your box... move a rock aside... and <br/>
   discover that there's already a letterbox in there!<br/>
- I've got a 28"x34" map of Georgia mounted on foamboard. <br/>
   I've stuck map pins in the locations where there be letterboxes.<br/>
   I reserve the blue pins for my own letterboxes, red pins for <br/>
   boxes I haven't found yet, and another color for locations that<br/>
   are home to more than one box (like Stone Mountain). The <br/>
   map is pretty darn empty, considering how large Georgia is, <br/>
   and that the boxes are clustered in a few choice locations.<br/>
- I think this would be nearly impossible to do with CT, even if<br/>
   the map was twice as large! For one, thing, I'd probably bust<br/>
   my letterbox budget just buying map pins!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that's enough for now! I'm going to go check on a letterbox <br/>
or two... <br/>
<br/>
See ya!<br/>

YES, PLEASE send the retirees to FL (panhandle) - make sure they are <br/>
in super water proof boxes though.  I'll be there probably in March <br/>
looking for them%^)  Otherwise I'll be stuck painting and decorating <br/>
a friend's new home.<br/>

Steve, this actualy happened in SE Ohio.  I got an email from a <br/>
geocacher who found the "perfect spot" for her cache only to <br/>
discover a letterbox already there.  And this was in the middle of a <br/>
forest, with plenty of other trees around!  (She placed the cache <br/>
there anyhow)<br/>

Hi, my name is Artdog and I'm a letterboxaholic. I can't leave home <br/>
without my pack, for fear I may have a moment to head to a nearby <br/>
park...the backseat of my car is littered with boxes of rubbermaid <br/>
containers that I bought on special at Sam's Club, and I imagine <br/>
stamp images as I drive by unique locations...<br/>

&gt;&gt; intervention yet by your loved ones? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi, my name is Artdog and I'm a letterboxaholic. I can't <br/>
&gt;leave home <br/>
&gt; without my pack, for fear I may have a moment to head to <br/>
&gt;a nearby <br/>
&gt; park...the backseat of my car is littered with boxes of <br/>
&gt;rubbermaid <br/>
&gt; containers that I bought on special at Sam's Club, and I <br/>
&gt;imagine <br/>
&gt; stamp images as I drive by unique locations...<br/>

A few weeks ago, I was out looking for a spot for a letterbox, found a great<br/>
one, but there was a geocache there already!<br/>

Yes, this also happened to us last weekend.  Two different locations,<br/>
planting two different boxes.  Both times saw the "perfect spot" only to<br/>
discover a geocache already there.  Who needs a GPS unit? -  we find these<br/>
things without investing in the technology!  We did NOT place our boxes in<br/>
the same spot, but went quite a distance away to avoid the possibility of<br/>
cachers accidentally finding the boxes.<br/>

&gt;which included the design if a double cupboard with 4 shelves<br/>
<br/>
Really? What's the name of the designer? My shelves are about full. <br/>
I've bothered the local craftsman to the point of madness. I'm <br/>
looking for someone else to fill his shoes. My village is remote, <br/>
though still accessible. Would he be willing to travel?<br/>
<br/>
 On another note: My collection continues to grow and grow. I want <br/>
to thank all of you who have contributed.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Random Thoughts on Current Topics<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi folks! Hope you all had nice holidays, whatever your <br/>
religious preferences!<br/>
<br/>
I've been getting a chuckle or two out of the all the comments <br/>
about retired boxes, LBNA vs AQ, and the proliferation of boxes.<br/>
<br/>
About those retired boxes... <br/>
- Do they get Social Security...? <br/>
      ... a pension? <br/>
      ... American Association of Retired Letterboxes benefits?<br/>
- Will the retired boxes move south to GA or FL?<br/>

It's happened in Western New York too!  I was looking for a place<br/>
to hide a letterbox and decided that a certain hollow tree would be <br/>
perfect!  It was!  A Geo-cacher beat me to it! <br/>

Happened in Calif. too. though I had placed my ltrbx on top of the <br/>
Geo. and one finder clued me into it. I had no idea the geo. was <br/>
there. But it was a city park with only 2 trees.......<br/>

And more than a year ago In Indiana, as well.  I had placed a LB at <br/>
the covered bridge in Versailles State Park while travelling to AR.  <br/>
Before I got home to post it here, another had been placed at the <br/>
bridge, tho in a different spot about 50 ft. away.  Mine has since <br/>
been vandalized, but I found the second - a hard-to-spot minibox.<br/>
