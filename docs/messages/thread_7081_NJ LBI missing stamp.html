                    <html><body>Thanks, whoever left the message on my answering maching about the missing stamp in the letterbox we planted in May (Jersey Shore Tracks #2).  Mary and I were gone for a few weeks so I haven't been able to pass that information on until now.
<br/>
<br/>We came to the conclusion that, yes, someone may have just stolen it (shame on him/her.) But thinking back to our boxing experiences, it may also have just gotten mistakenly placed in the finders backpack with their other boxing "stuff".  If that's the case, please either return it yourself, or contact us off list (if your prefer) and we can make some arrangements to get it back.
<br/>
<br/>The box is still there, just the stamp is missing.  Please feel free to stamp in if you're in the area.  We'll try to replace it in the future and let the list know when we do.
