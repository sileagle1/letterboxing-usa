<br/>
I know I can go through the archives, BUT I figured let me ask first... (why reinvent the wheel)<br/>
<br/>
The Baby Bandits, got wind of Ryan's Adventures on the AT, Which Passes not too far from here.  They wanted to know what his "stops" have been thus far.  I'm sure there is someone who has a map pinned on the dining room wall the with stops marked.  Soooo, if anyone would like to help us out and tell us, we'd be greatly appreciative.<br/>
