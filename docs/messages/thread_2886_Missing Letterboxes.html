&gt; I also recently hiked at Sleeping Giant State Park<br/>
&gt; (CT) and I also searched unsuccessfully for the Tower<br/>
&gt; Box. Thanks for letting us know that it's missing -<br/>
&gt; one always wonders what the story is when you search<br/>
&gt; but can't find it.  I did find 3 other boxes that day<br/>
&gt; (the Chin, the Chest, and the Right Hip).  On the<br/>
&gt; whole, I had a wonderful day, and I hope to go back<br/>
&gt; there soon to hunt for more boxes.  Sleeping Giant is<br/>
&gt; a great place!<br/>

<br/>
In the end, it is the responsibility of the hider to indicate on his clue<br/>
page that his or her box is missing.<br/>
<br/>
If we host the page at lettrboxing.org, and the author requests that it be<br/>
marked as missing, we will do so. Ideally, every hider will be checking in<br/>
on the boxes fairly regularly. But there are often cases where that isn't<br/>
possible. This does create a dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
If we mark the box as missing without the hider's authority, we could be<br/>
doing that person (and others) a real disservice - the box is simply hard to<br/>
find, which for many is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what the solution is.<br/>
<br/>
