As an artist, I think that the distinctions between the two types of ink may be more about "branding" the product than about describing the actually properties of the ink.  After all, a dye is supposed to change the color of the material it is applied to (think: your red t shirt) and pigment is not (think: getting housepaint on your red t shirt.)  Artists acrylics, to use one example, use both pigments and dyes in their products.  I believe that pigments are more color fast, and dyes are more fugative, but that generally refers to light fastness, which is not a big issue inside of a closed book!<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be interested to look at the Material Safety Data Sheet, and see it the colorants in these two types of ink actually are pigments in the the "pigment" products and dye in the "dye" products.<br/>

But I'm on vacation in Hawaii, and can't be bothered to look up MSDSes righht now....<br/>

<br/>
I've seen logbooks that have been soaked, soaked, soaked and most of the stamp <br/>
impressions remained on the pages. Even as an artist myself, the only way I can tell that <br/>
someone used a pigment was because it leached through the page and affixed itself to the <br/>
page underneath (as well as the one on top).<br/>
<br/>
I'd wager that it's the stamp impressions made with washable markers that disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
Cha-ching... another 2 cents.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually it's the other way around....dye inks run and bleed away, <br/>
pigments remain. <br/>
<br/>
I know this from personal expirience, after rescuing at least 2 water <br/>
logged books. I always stamp in pigment ink, and my sign is always <br/>
fine....you can tell which pages anyone stamped in dye inks on, <br/>
because their signatures are gone. Also, I was rubberstamping for <br/>
many years before I started letterboxing. When doing background <br/>
techniques with a dye ink pad you can spritz water on it for a spotty <br/>
effect, etc. You can't do that with pigment ink pads.<br/>
<br/>
I think the emulsions in most pigment ink pads are what keep the <br/>
images more water-fast (or whatever the word would be). Those inks <br/>
seem thikcer than dye inks, which are water based.<br/>
