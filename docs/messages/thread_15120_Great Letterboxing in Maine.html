                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Folks.  Just wanted to add our two cents worth to all the thank <br/>
yous for The Maine Event.  Special thanks to "Sealights", "Phynstar" <br/>
and others who stayed late into the afternoon to make sure that we <br/>
all had time to find all of the specially planted event boxes.  <br/>
Thanks also to all the other organizers, helpers, etc.  Many, many <br/>
thanks to all the Maine and other letterboxers that we met and had so <br/>
much fun talking to and questing with.  Thanks to MemLili and <br/>
Seahorse 44 for accompanying us on our quests, and for great <br/>
companionship.  By my count we exchanged with 33 other boxers, and <br/>
there were some present with whom we had already exchanged stamps.  I <br/>
have some decent pictures of the event that I will post in <br/>
the "photos" section as soon as I can process them (may take a week <br/>
or so to work on them all).<br/>
<br/>
After the gathering we continued to box in Maine, in spite of <br/>
continuing bouts with rain.  We were successful in finding the <br/>
following boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox at Bay Bridge Landing (Brunswick)<br/>
Rings in Heaven (as darkness fell, we met fellow boxers from The <br/>
Maine Event at this one)(Brunswick)<br/>
Thorncrag Bird Sanctuary (Lewiston)<br/>
Fern Finder (Lisbon)<br/>
Best Friends (Topsham)<br/>
Skofield Preserve (Brunswick)<br/>
<br/>
Then we traveled Downeast, and found (and didn't find) various boxes <br/>
in the Ellsworth/Southwest Harbor area.  We will communicate with <br/>
placers off the talk list about our adventures there.<br/>
<br/>
On our way home, we found the following boxes elsewhere in Maine:<br/>
<br/>
Peacock Pandora Letterbox (Ellsworth)<br/>
Blue's Hill Letterbox<br/>
Fort Point Letterbox<br/>
Lobster Letterbox<br/>
Mount Battie Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
We also picked up the "Moaning Myrtle HH" at the Lobster Letterbox <br/>
and dropped her off somewhere else.<br/>
<br/>
All in all a fun 5 days in spite of intermittent clouds, fog and <br/>
rain.  It did clear beautifully on Mount Battie so that we could see <br/>
many of the offshore islands.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all you Maniacs --- and we'll surely be back to do the <br/>
southern Maine boxes in the future (couldn't see doing them at 1 <br/>
o'clock in the morning on the ride home).<br/>
