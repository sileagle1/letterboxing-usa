                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Trish!  I know you have kids and my daughter Bonnie(age 10) put together<br/>
the Mother Hubbard Letterboxes on an easy and fun trail at the Chaplin Town<br/>
Hall/recreation area.  Three letterboxes on a 1 1/4 mile loop, including<br/>
some interesting beaver work.  There are foot an a half diameter trees that<br/>
have been toppled by the beavers around the Darling Pond there that kids<br/>
would find interesting.  Plus the story is cute!  Give it a try and if you<br/>
have a dog, or know someone with a dog, take a treat at the end!  Course,<br/>
you could eat them yourselves.  (When I was a kid, we had a bus driver who<br/>
would give us dog biscuits, and all of us kids started eating them<br/>
ourselves!  That was in kindergarten! Oh well, just a funny story to tell.)<br/>
Hope you and others get to visit the Mother hubbard Boxes in Chaplin!<br/>

&gt; Hi Trish, depending on just what part of Chaplin your'e in I would <br/>
suggest Paddle To The Sea and You Otter See That  both on the Windham <br/>
Chaplin line off Rte 6 near the Walmart and Airport. Look for river <br/>
otters and swans as well as migratory birds always an interesting set <br/>
of wildlife near the Hollow.   Carol - Leader of the Pack<br/>
