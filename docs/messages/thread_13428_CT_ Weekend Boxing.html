<br/>
In between real life responsiblities, we managed to<br/>
spend a nice couple of days in northwest CT on the<br/>
trails, despite the rain on Saturday. <br/>
<br/>
DEP Tunxis State Forest: Found as advertised. There<br/>
seems to be no end to the number of nice spots along<br/>
the Tunxis Trail.<br/>
<br/>
DEP People's State Forest: The bugs tried to eat us<br/>
alive. Couldn't get back to the car fast enough to<br/>
outrun them!<br/>
<br/>
Still Waters: The clues are a bit off, but we found it<br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
DEP American Legion State Forest: Slightly longer walk<br/>
than advertised, but well worth the trip. The view of<br/>
the Farmington River is excellent.<br/>
<br/>
DEP Algonquin State Forest: It's fun to be first! :-)<br/>
<br/>
One more for our commemorative State Forest Centennial<br/>
patch! And I know just the place to go....<br/>
