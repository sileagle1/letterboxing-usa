truly been a liberating experience when I have been able to take her <br/>
letterboxing in the Portland area. She tells me every detail in <br/>

that I am looking forward to getting to know many of you much better <br/>
in the projected future. A fair warning beforehand I do tend to <br/>
remain silent overall, and will more than likely say very little, but <br/>
I do read the vast majority of what comes across the board. However <br/>
when I am so inclined to comment it usually can be consider a <br/>

Nice to know you, I once sent the "Bear's Angel" hitchhiker along on <br/>
its journey to you up north.<br/>
