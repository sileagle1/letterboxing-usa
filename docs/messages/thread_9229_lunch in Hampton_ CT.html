Deanne and I are planning a day full of Hampton quests for tomorrow.  <br/>
Any recommendations for a quaint lunch spot with good food?  Also, is <br/>
it hunting season there?  And of the 26 boxes listed in Hampton, are <br/>
there any confirmed missing boxes? Thanks in advance for info and <br/>

It is hunting season--wear blaze orange just in case. Pheasant,duck <br/>
and goose season is open--also deer season. I'm not sure that there <br/>
is hunting allowed in all the areas you would be going to in Hampton, <br/>
be prepared just in case. As far as a quaint place in Hampton, can't <br/>
think of any off hand-- You'll probably have to venture somewhere <br/>
else for a nice place--Pomfret has some nice places..and Letterboxes <br/>
too!<br/>
 Good luck Letterboxing!! Irish Mum <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hunted for Trailwood's Back Door on 11/2, and I found that some <br/>
revisions are needed to the directions.  I hope this will help <br/>
future letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Being the recipient of donated labor and materials from a <br/>
corporation, Trailwood now has a nice new bridge where the clues say <br/>
no bridge here.  Enjoy the safe and easy crossing of the stream.<br/>
<br/>
There is a change needed after the bridge, where the clues say bear <br/>
left (actually mostly straight).  Following the path to the second <br/>
stone wall brings you to Griffin Rd, about 200 feet east of the <br/>
railroad crossing, within sight of your car.  This path is <br/>
preferable to the railroad route.  It saves about one mile of <br/>
walking.  The path is all on Trailwood's property.<br/>
<br/>
If you instead turn right after crossing the bridge, you will come <br/>
to more likely looking stone walls.<br/>
<br/>
I looked for the box in a stone wall, but did not find it.  After I <br/>
left I realized I was looking in the wrong stone wall (duh).  As <br/>
McArthur said, I shall return.<br/>
<br/>
The eatery I can recommend is the Vanilla Bean Cafe in nearby <br/>
Pomfret.  I have enjoyed my meals there.  Check the hours before you <br/>
go.<br/>
