Letterbox Name:  Bald Cypress Letterbox<br/>

"Redwoods in Florida?  You are going to see one, though it might not fit<br/>
your conception of a redwood.<br/>
<br/>
There are 15 species of redwoods worldwide.  There are only four native<br/>
to North America.  Two are in the western U.S. (the California Redwood<br/>
and the Giant Sequoia) and two are in the eastern U.S., though one of<br/>
the eastern trees is found primarily in two counties in southern Texas.<br/>
<br/>
The other of the eastern redwoods is prominent in swampy regions, like<br/>
your destination.  The Bald Cypress is a large tree, often surrounded by<br/>
cypress knees, which are little projections from the root system.<br/>
Oddly, the Bald Cypress is a deciduous tree, unlike its redwood<br/>
counterparts.  Common mature Bald Cypress trees are large, growing to<br/>
heights of 120 feet or more and with large diameters.  The National<br/>
Champion Bald Cypress is 83 feet tall and a whopping 54 feet in<br/>
circumference (or 17 feet in diameter).  It is found at Cat Island,<br/>
Louisiana.<br/>
<br/>
The tree near your destination isnt THAT big, but it is a large<br/>
beautiful Bald Cypress in a somewhat suburban setting, though a bit off<br/>
the beaten path.  Follow the clues to find this tree that began its life<br/>
shortly before Ponce de Leon discovered Florida.<br/>
<br/>
Jacksonville is home to two four-year universities.  Each has an animal<br/>
mascot.  Only one of them could use our Bald Cypress as a resting<br/>
place.  Proceed to the school having this animal as its mascot.  Use the<br/>
entrance that is farthest from the ocean, and park in the first parking<br/>
lot on your right (just past the booth).<br/>
<br/>
There is a system of trails here.  The trails are named after plants.<br/>
Choose the trail whose inedible plant includes the varieties<br/>
blue-stemmed, sweet and showy.  Start at the southerly entrance to<br/>
this trail which also serves as an entrance for another of the trails.<br/>
<br/>
The walk is a short, easy one, and particularly pleasant from Fall to<br/>
mid-Spring. You will walk through a mixed forest, gradually<br/>
transitioning to pine flatwoods.  When you see the isolated Sabal Palm<br/>
Tree on your right, you are halfway there.<br/>
<br/>
Soon, the two trails you have been walking diverge.  Do not deviate from<br/>
the designated trail.  Approximately 1/10th of a mile beyond this<br/>
divergence, you will again come to a fork in the trail.  If you choose<br/>
the correct path, you will see a wooden bench within 10 to 15 paces.<br/>
Straight ahead of you, facing about 80 degrees (magnetic) is the Bald<br/>
Cypress.  Depending on when you visit, you may have to view it from a<br/>
distance, since a small swampy creek normally separates you and the<br/>
tree.<br/>
<br/>
When it is swampy in this area, you could easily lose a shoe (or a leg)<br/>
trying to walk across the sucking mud.  Accordingly, the letterbox is<br/>
not located beneath the Bald Cypress (though there are some great hiding<br/>
places).  Instead, while facing the Bald Cypress and standing at the<br/>
edge of the creek, turn approximately 100 degrees to your left.  You<br/>
will see two good-sized trees approximately six feet away from you, on<br/>
the same side of the creek as you.  The trees are a foot or so apart.<br/>
The one on the right has very light bark (almost white) and appears to<br/>
be a maple tree.  The one on the left has dark bark (almost black in the<br/>
forest shade), and appears to be an oak tree.  This oak tree has a wide<br/>
base, with several outstretched legs.  At the base of this tree, on<br/>
the opposite side of where you are standing, you will find the Bald<br/>
Cypress Letterbox.  Ironic that the Bald Cypress Letterbox appears<br/>
beneath an oak tree having legs, but not knees.<br/>
<br/>

where you found them.  If anything is missing (book or stamp), please<br/>

letterbox in the Jacksonville area."<br/>
