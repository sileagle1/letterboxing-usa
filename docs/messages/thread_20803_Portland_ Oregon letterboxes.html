Just found out today that I'm going to have to make a quick trip to <br/>
the Portland area in about 10 days.  Won't have much extra time but <br/>
would love to try to find a letterbox or two.  I know there are <br/>
plenty in the area <vbg><br/>
<br/>
So would anyone like to recommend a couple of their favorites?  I'll <br/>
have a dog along so dog friendly would be nice &amp; I especially like <br/>
hand carved stamps.  I'll be coming &amp; going on I-84 so outside the <br/>
metro area along the river would be fine too.<br/>
<br/>
THANKS!!!!!<br/>
