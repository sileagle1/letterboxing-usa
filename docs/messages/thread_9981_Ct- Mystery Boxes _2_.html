  Happy New Year To All- Here are Two Not-So-Difficult Mystery Boxes<br/>
     We are like Butterfly- we want you to get them ;D <br/>
<br/>
   Difficulty: EASY<br/>
   Time: Slow Camel can do it quickly but does not like to rush !<br/>
   Take your time and let your imagination wander. Take it all in.  <br/>
<br/>
   Slow Camel and the Coach have planted 2 new letterboxes.<br/>
Please go to the top of White Oak Lane and follow to its end. Turn <br/>
and head back 25 steps. On the south side of the wall (sinister), you <br/>
will find the prize you seek. Be careful of the carriages which may <br/>
come through. We wouldn't want you to get run over.<br/>
   Now find the Westbourne Road wall where the orange meets the blue.<br/>
Follow the wall in a southwesterly fashion. There is no trail per se<br/>
but you will not get lost. Go to the wall's end which faces the <br/>
athletic fields and turn around to head back. Go 15 steps to the tree <br/>
by the wall. The "Looking Back Letterbox" is tucked 'neath the tree's <br/>
sister who is now only a stump of her former self.<br/>
   We wish you all Good Health, Happiness and Peace in 2003 and many <br/>
wonderful letterboxing adventures.<br/>
<br/>
