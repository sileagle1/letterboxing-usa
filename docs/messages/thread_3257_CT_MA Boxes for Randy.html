I agree that Walk Through Geologic Time is probably just what you're <br/>
looking for: From I-84 (junction in Hartford) just go south on I-91 <br/>
for a few exits.<br/>
<br/>
Barb &amp; Larry's Ledge is very pretty, which is just off I-691 <br/>
(junction with I-84 in Southington). It's long enough to give you a <br/>
sense of accomplishment. After, just pick up I-91 Northbound to get <br/>
back on track. Hmmm, could do these then follow with Walk Through <br/>
Time.<br/>
<br/>
The Black Dog/Castle Craig/East Peak hike is a long one--about 8 <br/>
miles round trip.  But if you do take I-691 from Southington to <br/>
Meriden, you'll pass right below Castle Craig.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Randy, I think the one that meets your criteria best may be Walk <br/>
&gt; &gt;Through Geologic Time (by Elmer and family). I hear it's a jewel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could not agree more. It is right off the highway and takes no <br/>
more than an hour.<br/>
&gt; The stamps are way cool. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, we cannot take credit for these wonderful boxes. S.Pike <br/>
and "frogger" must be credited.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We can lay claim to being the first to stamp in though.<br/>

&gt; Happy hunting<br/>
