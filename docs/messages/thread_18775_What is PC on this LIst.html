As a service to the newer members of this list, I will share with <br/>
you what I have gathered about the rules for topics for this list.<br/>
<br/>
BANNED- sure to get you slammed:<br/>
<br/>
Reporting finds (sit reps)<br/>
<br/>
Reporting failure to find (repot these only to the box placer, even <br/>
if s/he never reads emails)<br/>
<br/>
Children who box<br/>
<br/>
Anything that contradicts the opinions of the "older boxes" who the <br/>
arbiters of what is okay in this "no rules" sports  {if they don't <br/>
think its PC, don't post) [Note , this is tricky as some "older <br/>
boxes really haven't been boxing that long - but they are buddies <br/>
with the in group -- you can pick them out by their posts, not their <br/>
length of boxing]<br/>
<br/>
Most discussions of letterboxes<br/>
<br/>
Questions about letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
I am sure I have left something out, so when in doubt, don't post.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY TOPICs  (sure to earn you a place with the "in" group)<br/>
<br/>
Praise for boxes and stamps of older boxes [but don't mention <br/>
anything specific about the box or you'll get slammed for giving <br/>
stuff away] - maybe not such a good topic after all<br/>
<br/>
Slams of store bought stamps (though some older boxes do have store <br/>
bought stamps as their personal stamp, curiously enough, so use a <br/>
little caution here)<br/>
<br/>
Ideas for NEW ways to make logbooks [Maybe, some older boxes don't <br/>
have fancy logbooks, so you don't want to step on any toes)<br/>
<br/>
Praise and support for the opinions of the older boxers.<br/>
<br/>
Gee, can't think of any more. I looked over the posts from those who <br/>
claim to know what is good for the list, but most of their posts are <br/>
slams, complaints or support for one another. Not too much new or <br/>
useful to the sport.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One final word of advice: if you are a sensitive soul, this is not a <br/>
good list for you. Read, if you can bear it, but don't post.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Bill <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, thanks Bill. I don't usually step on toes, but I do a very good <br/>
job of opening my mouth and inserting my foot. That being said, I <br/>
look forward to many lively, colorful and enthusiastic responses <br/>
from 'senior' boxers' and other outspoken members.<br/>
