blood as a substitute for a dry ink pad is just creeping me out.<br/>
<br/>
Can we end the discussion and start a new one?<br/>
<br/>
I have a question, asked already of another group, but for the sake <br/>
of a new topic, I'll post it here.<br/>
<br/>
I'm working on creating a series of letterboxes.  Originally, I had <br/>
planned to list them all together as a group, but the text of the <br/>
background stories and clues is rather long -- six pages on Word.  <br/>
Therefore, I'm thinking of listing them separately, with a unifying <br/>
title (all the same box name), plus a #1 or Box #1 (2,3, etc.) <br/>
affixed to the ends of the titles, in MY preferred order of searching.<br/>
<br/>
Two of the boxes are in the same neighborhood, so I might group them <br/>
together in the same listing.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for words of wisdom from you more experienced 'boxers, as I <br/>
have yet to plant my first box.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
