late August of this year.  I am thrilled to be able to<br/>
report that I found my 100th box today as I was hiking<br/>
Onion Mt. Park in West Simsbury, CT with my daughter.<br/>
Nice stamps.  We found 3 of the boxes there, then ran<br/>
out of time.  Will go back soon to look for the rest. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Noticed that the boxes were not well hidden by the<br/>
last finders.  The lid was off one box and the book<br/>
was not in a plastic bag. (We provided one for the<br/>
book).  The other two were lying exposed by their<br/>
nesting places.  One could be seen from the trail, the<br/>
other could not.  We rehid carefully.  Wanted to get<br/>
to the other two to check out how they were hid but<br/>
didn't make it.  Timed committments...  you know what<br/>
those are.<br/>
<br/>
We have been having a great time hiking and finding.  <br/>
I am carrying extra bags since I have seen a few that<br/>
needed replacing, and a trash bag to carry out litter<br/>
that we may come upon.  <br/>
