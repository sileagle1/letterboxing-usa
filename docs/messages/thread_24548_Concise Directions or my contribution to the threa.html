I'm sorry, but how pompous can you be? I have been boxing<br/>
for four years, and one of the things that drew me to the<br/>
hobby was the relatively low to no cost factor of it. As a<br/>
single parent I am on an extremely tight budget. Would I<br/>
drive to Maine or "travel at all to find letterboxes" Of<br/>
course, and quite enjoy doing so. That by no means implies<br/>
that I can afford a gps because I may choose to spend $30<br/>
in gas to go boxing further away and have memorable times<br/>
and hikes and vistas. And no, I am not afraid of<br/>
technology. Your sweeping generalizations do nothing to<br/>
plead your case<br/>
-Dragonfly<br/>
<br/>
============================<br/>
<br/>
Ditto from me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not afraid of the technology whatsoever and while I *would* find it<br/>
extremely boring to locate letterboxes via GPS and thus would not be<br/>
interested in a GPS and would not box if boxing were set up that way, even<br/>
if I *were* interested, it wouldn't fit into the budget.  If the membership<br/>
votes yes on this latest contract that was negotiated, I'll actually be<br/>
taking a step backwards in pay and money will be even tighter.  Yes, I do<br/>
spend gas to go traveling to boxes.  I don't live in Connecticut.  I think<br/>
most people who don't live in Connecticut eventually have to begin traveling<br/>
for boxes.  But I have to consciously save money in my budget in order to be<br/>
able to do that.  So if I had to choose between traveling less and thus<br/>
finding fewer boxes in the long run in order to buy a decent enough GPS that<br/>
it's going to last plus actually be at least a *little* on the precise side,<br/>
and traveling more, to a few more boxes, I'll take traveling to more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
One of my complaints about GPS is the *lack* of concise directions.  Twice<br/>
now, I've come across geocachers on the trail who were pretty much ripping<br/>
the environment apart attempting to find a cache.  I wasn't impressed.  At<br/>
least not in a positive way.  So I don't see that GPS is much of a step<br/>
above as far as concise directions go.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, if I wanted absolutely concise directions to a box (which I don't,<br/>
neither as a placer nor a finder, but if I did), and couldn't find a way to<br/>
do it in a particular location, I wouldn't plant a box there.  If it was an<br/>
absolutely fantastic location that I felt boxers just *had* to visit, I'd<br/>
consider possibly *beginning* the clues at that location and using something<br/>
about that location in the clues, so that the finder would be forced to<br/>
visit the location at least a bit, but actually have the box hidden at a<br/>
location where I *could* give concise directions.  Not every location, no<br/>
matter how beautiful/historical/educational/etc, works out as a good<br/>
location for a letterbox.<br/>

I own a GPS.  I can afford a GPS.  GPS does not equal letterboxing in <br/>

Did I say that?  No, don't believe that I did, so you can knock it <br/>
off. <br/>
<br/>
I did say that I've seen that geocachers tend to trample the flora <br/>
and fauna around geocaches a lot more than letterboxers do around a <br/>
box.  Could be they are staring at the screen instead of using clues <br/>
or their intuition to draw them into where it might be? <br/>
<br/>
 I think you need to get outside more.  I'm sure you could find some <br/>
neat places with your GPS to visit instead of arguing that one is a <br/>
requirement for letterboxing.<br/>

 I did *not* say that a letterbox with GPS coordinates equals a <br/>
geocache.  I did say that I've seen what happens around geocaches.  <br/>
The correct inference would be that *I* won't find a letterbox with <br/>
GPS coordinates because *I* believe the same trampling of the area <br/>
would occur as does around geocaches and that is not no trace.<br/>
<br/>
You need lessons on reading and making correct inferences.<br/>
<br/>
You also need lessons on ettiquette.  Notice, I did not call you <br/>
names.  I've observed over the years that often times those who <br/>
resort to name calling usually don't feel comfortable about their <br/>
positions.<br/>

<br/>
I said what I meant that a GPS doesn't equal letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
 I did *not* say that a letterbox with GPS coordinates equals a<br/>
geocache.  I did say that I've seen what happens around geocaches.<br/>
The correct inference would be that *I* won't find a letterbox with<br/>
GPS coordinates because *I* believe the same trampling of the area<br/>
would occur as does around geocaches and that is not no trace.<br/>
<br/>
You need lessons on reading and making correct inferences.<br/>
<br/>
You also need lessons on ettiquette.  Notice, I did not call you<br/>
names.  I've observed over the years that often times those who<br/>
resort to name calling usually don't feel comfortable about their<br/>
positions.<br/>
<br/>
Now, knock it off.<br/>

When it comes to trashing an area, letterboxers can be as bad as geocachers (much more <br/>
of a rare occurance, but happens). I once came upon a wall in Darien Connecticut that was <br/>
decimated at the box spot. The box was long gone, but pursuit was ongoing. My kids and <br/>
I did a pretty good job putting the wall back together, but had to do it again a year later. <br/>
<br/>
Last year I wanted to create a Letterbox with GPS coords for a clue. I took a look at the <br/>
archives and found a reference from Mapsurfer about using a GPS for letterboxing before <br/>
Geocaching existed. Since I already had respect for this individual, my "creative" approach <br/>
seemed appropriate. When I placed the box I wanted a spot that was going to be hard to <br/>
destroy if people who had bad/spotty readings/signals ranged out. Some of the people at <br/>
the last gather I attended were aware of what I had done ( the GPS box) , no one threw <br/>
anything at me (unless I was looking in the wrong direction and they missed!)<br/>
<br/>
I don't care how dumb or esoteric the clues are to a box as long as I have a good shot at <br/>
finding it or a good warning that I'm not up to finding it. That dosen't mean easy. Just a <br/>
legit shot at it with my eyes open. It amazes me how often I still will be walking around <br/>
with my eyes shut but thats my problem. <br/>
<br/>
Please forgive my if this has all been stated before. Oh , yeah, and don't hate the GPS <br/>
crowd so much , they are Letterboxers cousins afterall!<br/>

Nope, it will only be a new low for the list if we neglect to express <br/>
our community outrage at this behavior. I suggest that 100 of us <br/>

Probably not. I was once contacted by Obi Wan for a comment that I<br/>

<br/>
GPS units have really opened up my horizons - I'm not afraid to drive to unknown and far away locations. Before using the GPS system I didn't venture past the city I lived in. I don't have great map reading skills and it's hard to read them while driving. I was scared of getting lost on on country roads. I didn't do any hiking, afraid to venture into forests for fear of getting turned around in the maze of trails and hopelessly lost. <br/>
<br/>
Now I'm a more confident driver and hiker. This summer I drove 600 kms in one day (just me and my dog) to go hunting for letterboxes (found 8 - there aren't many up here). I used my GPS unit to mark the general locations of each box and let the GPS unit tell me how far away it is, the estimated time of arrival, and which highways and streets to take that would get me there quickest. It's a great time saving device. <br/>

<br/>
We are free to go after what ever boxes we want. You don't go after <br/>
ones that need a GPS becuase you don't have one (as well as other <br/>
reasons). I don't go after mysteries because my hard ware upstairs <br/>
doe not work well enough:) Neither of us has the right tool. I also <br/>
understand that if my situation were different seeing a GPS box <br/>
might get me a little mad. I'm in Connecticut, with lots of choices. <br/>
If I was in an area with 15 boxes within 50 miles in any direction, <br/>
and I had done all of them, thats different. If someone put a GPS <br/>
box out and I could not get the only box around because I don't have <br/>
a GPS unit would drive me nuts. Its still a box though. I have that <br/>
problem with the mysteries around me.<br/>
<br/>
I actually would not push for more GPS type clues either. I think <br/>
they have their place, sort of like a change of pace. I have placed <br/>
about 60 boxes and the need to do something different sometimes <br/>
strikes. Its considerate to think about those that have to find your <br/>
creations. If no one in the area has a GPS, well that might be an <br/>
issue, but if there are a lot of people who you know do both <br/>
hobbies, the impact may be very positive.<br/>
<br/>
The box I created with the Geo clue was one that I simply did not <br/>
want do the usual go left, go right, follow blue clues. The few who <br/>
have found seem content and no complaints (except from my wife who <br/>
said I was wasting my time doing it). <br/>
<br/>
The original name of the thread was "Concise Directions". I skipped <br/>
almost all of the beginning stuff but will say this, if its <br/>
creative, its (ok caveat-usually) in. I have a feeling someone will <br/>
tell me I drove off the cliff with that statement, but thats fine- <br/>
I've been wrong before!<br/>

&gt; Why not?  Of course, why not?  I have no problem with anyone using <br/>
GPS <br/>
&gt; for their clues.  Their box, their clues.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wouldn't be finding the box because of my previously stated <br/>
beliefs, <br/>
&gt; however someone else might find it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The truth is, though, that most letterboxers wouldn't find it <br/>
either <br/>
&gt; because they don't have a GPS or think as I do.  It's not that <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; are afraid of a GPS, as was stated, but it's that it's not <br/>
inherent to <br/>
&gt; letterboxing and an expense a lot are not willing to bear for an <br/>
&gt; occassional box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That does not mean, however, there should be a push to make more <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; based on GPS clues to justify the cost.  That would become <br/>
something <br/>
&gt; else altogether--either geoboxing or lettercaching or Binx (I made <br/>
&gt; that name up cause, well, it's really not letterboxing as a whole <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; we change it in such a drastic measure across the board.)<br/>

I bought (or rather asked for a GPS for Christmas a few years ago)<br/>
strictly for letterboxing.  I use a mapping program to plot boxes so<br/>
that I can gather as many as time allows when I am in a particular<br/>
area.  I asked for and received a GPS.  When I hide a new box, I use<br/>
it to plot its exact location on my map. I also use it to figure out<br/>
how long the hike is and the elevation to that box for those fields on<br/>
AQ. <br/>
<br/>
Also, since I usually hike alone, I have begun using it to mark the<br/>
path which I have walked in case I would happen to get disoriented and<br/>
can't find my way back.  I learned this trick last year after getting<br/>
lost on Haycock Mountain with Sheba and not having any clue where our<br/>
cars were.  At the very least, I try to mark the spot where my car is<br/>
parked now.<br/>
<br/>
It is just a neat new toy to play with when boxing.  I have never<br/>
used it for a geocache  In fact, I am not even sure HOW to use it yet<br/>
for a cache.<br/>

yet<br/>

Also, since I usually hike alone, I have begun using it [GPS] to mark the<br/>
path which I have walked in case I would happen to get disoriented and<br/>
can't find my way back. I learned this trick last year after getting<br/>
lost on Haycock Mountain with Sheba and not having any clue where our<br/>

weekend in central Illinois trying to detail our every move so that we could<br/>
get back to our vehicle..........I'm seriously thinking of investing in a<br/>
GPS just for that reason.  Peace of mind.  Doing it by compass was almost<br/>
impossible.<br/>
<br/>
And we never did find the box after all we went thru.  But I didn't actually<br/>
care at that point.  I didn't care if I saw a letterbox, I just wanted to<br/>
see my car again.  :-)  So I may have to forego some of our<br/>
Gas-Money-for-Traveling-to-Boxes Fund in order to buy a GPS.  I'm now<br/>
starting a GPS Fund.<br/>
<br/>
And having Elmer along was absolutely no help.......darn<br/>
coonhound...........I'm sure if our car had been a raccoon, he could have<br/>
found it in two seconds.......but nooooooooooooo......he didn't care about<br/>
finding a car.<br/>
<br/>
Having three smashed &amp; busted toes was no help either tho.  It didn't take<br/>
long to put me in a bad mood tryin' to get outta there with my smashed foot.<br/>
But GPS here we come.  That would've been a big help.<br/>
