<br/>
My mate and I gave "letterbox kits" to his two oldest grandchildren  <br/>
for Christmas.  This consisted of a letterbox itself, a small <br/>
Strathmore sketchpad, a stamp pad and a rubber stamp.  I took one of <br/>
them out here in Oregon on Monday to search for easy slough clues on <br/>
the trail and then took her out to visit Thom Cheney's letterboxes at <br/>
the Tualatin Hills Nature Park.  Yowza!  The kid is hooked and is <br/>
looking forward to hunting for more and wants to help me replace Der <br/>
Mad Stamper's Mt. Tabor box, possibly next weekend.<br/>
<br/>
I'm heading to Southern Oregon in a couple weeks and if all goes well <br/>
there will be new letterboxes to find over by Glide at Colliding <br/>
Rivers and Wolf Creek Falls.  <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is a blast!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

to go letterboxing kits as a gift. I will keep that in mind. </div>

thing to her daughter's friend so they can go letterboxing together.  They<br/>
might get something started at their school, too, if there is enough<br/>
interest.  Seems like a good way to get people excited about letterboxing!  <br/>
<br/>
We're slower than you guys on the East Coast at getting this going, but our<br/>
day will come as interest grows!  Between Der Mad Stamper, Thom Cheney, and<br/>
me we will get more placed in the Pacific Northwest for sure this year!  Not<br/>
to mention the potential letterboxing fans who have yet to discover this<br/>
great hobby who will place some of their own in the future!!!<br/>
