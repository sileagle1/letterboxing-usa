Hi There!<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this message board but have been letterboxing with my <br/>
husband and children for about 2 years now.  Back in July we wanted <br/>
to go to the Island of Sodor, which has 3 stamps.  We successfully <br/>
found the first stamp, but could not find the other two (I'm almost <br/>
positive I had the right spots).  I emailed (or tried to anyways) <br/>
the placer to say that we could not find the last 2)  I just <br/>
recently went back over the trail and again I could not find the <br/>
last 2.  Maybe i'm not looking in the right place.  I <br/>
realize "answers" can't be posted, but has anyone else had trouble <br/>
finding the last 2?  My 4yo son LOVES Thomas the Tank Engine and I <br/>
would really like to find the Percy and James (the last 2 stamps)  <br/>
Any suggestions or thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

I am very jealous.  It seems like CT has the coolest series.  This <br/>
one and the one listed the other day, Journey into the Imagination, <br/>
sound like great fun if you have kids.  We either need people to <br/>
plant some like these in NH or I'm moving to CT.  <br/>
