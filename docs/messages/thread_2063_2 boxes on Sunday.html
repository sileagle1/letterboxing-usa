                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to the Drews  and Eric Eurto for their  boxes we visited The <br/>
Notable Sugar Maple and  Avery Memorial Boxes yesterday. It was a <br/>
great day to be out. Hope everyone enjoyed the Lantern Hill, we opted <br/>
out of that due to depth of snow adding difficulty  and that the <br/>
Cowboy needed to sleep late after double sleepover ( misnomer I think <br/>
they never slept). Ahhh.... remember  being a kid and staying up all <br/>
night with a buddy and flashlights under the blankets, tiptoeing <br/>
through a sleeping house. <br/>
     To Eric: thanks for the history lesson.  We enjoyed Avery very <br/>
much the Huntingtons are our ancesters and it was interesting to see <br/>
the cemetary. My brother lives in the Joseph huntington House in <br/>
Coventry( Samuel's brother). Friends who went with us are  history <br/>
buffs and knew lots of great details.  Well worth the climb, I <br/>
wouldn't drive my horse up that carriage path ,chicken aren't I.<br/>
     Both boxes in excellent condition.  Carol- in -barn chores <br/>
waiting ,wish I could go boxing!<br/>
