<div>Just a reminder to the list that US Forest Service 
has also blessed letterboxing, at least in the Gallatin NF in Montana. The 
precedent is set there. I can provide copies of the letter I received if anyone 
else needs support for putting "approved" letterboxes in national forests. My 
local ranger did reserve the right to consider the locations in which the boxes 
would be placed, but has approved five and expressed a willingness to approve 
others.</div>

I would appreciate having a copy of the letter ... I am hoping to get <br/>
approval from the local municipal park districts and that might help.<br/>

And the conversation will go like this: <br/>
<br/>
"But DAD! it's fun! Besides other scoutmasters are<br/>
doing it, Hey even crazy Murray is doing it!"<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't take to much to get them to change their<br/>
minds, once you get them into the woods and they stamp<br/>
up, they say "hey, here's a new program<br/>
idea.....cheap, too.....won't have to sell much<br/>
popcorn for this!"<br/>

An orienteering course set in the wood would be  littering in his mind too.<br/>
What better way to get the boys into map and compass work then having a goal<br/>
(a stamp) at the end of the course.  My family and I have been collecting<br/>
Nat'l Park stamps in our Passport book for years. It has become very<br/>
important to always have the Passport in the car when we travel incase we<br/>
hit a NP... That is why we are getting into LB too.  I think it is the<br/>
treasure hunt kind of thing....<br/>
