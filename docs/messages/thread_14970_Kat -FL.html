                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!! I was gone for a couple of days and look at all the posts.  It <br/>
is wonderful that this is such an active group.  I'm glad to see some <br/>
newbies like me.  Hey, Busy Bee from TX glad to see your still here.<br/>
<br/>
Went to Orlando to visit my sister.  Actually I think I have her <br/>
hooked.  I took my 4yr old to get our starting equip. Stamps, inc and <br/>
journal.  Came back and started to hunt for the Disney Series.  Our <br/>
first find was at Celebration. Found it.  Hurried to look thru it and <br/>
sent kids and bro-in-law back to van before the sky opened up and it <br/>
poured rain.  My sister and I looked like we just jumped in and out <br/>
of a pool when we arrived back at the van.  Off to Fort Wilderness.  <br/>
I didn't realize we needed a compass so we have to go back.  We saw <br/>
some good places it could of been but everyone was chicken to stick <br/>
there hands in wet slimy stumps.  Of course one had a HUGE frog in <br/>
it. 2nd box we found at the Caribean Resort.  Found the ButterFly <br/>
HichHiker in it. What a great surprise!  Rain Rain Go Away!!! Yep had <br/>
that inky fingers, legs, shorts thing going on.  What fun:)<br/>
<br/>
On to Ichetucknee Springs.  After a discouraging forcast of 80% <br/>
chance of rain and the storm in the morning. It cleared up when we <br/>
hit the Spring.  8:30 in the morning the mist on the Spring was <br/>
enchanting.  We had the area almost all to ourselves. Rain scared <br/>
everyone off.  Around 4:30 out of the spring to enhale our lunch and <br/>
off in search of Drangonfly LB.  All the boys ate and fell asleep and <br/>
the girls went on a hike.  Great spot!!!!!  (Came prepared with <br/>
gloves this time ;)<br/>
<br/>
We were going to do more LB thru Gainsville, Ocala and Lake Wales but <br/>
it really was rainy and dreary and my 4yr was whiny.  Next trip.<br/>
<br/>
I'm excited and have some good ideas for planting my own boxes.  <br/>
Hopefully people will come find them.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello again, Kat! I knew you must have been away, letterboxing, <br/>
since you 'disappeared'. :)<br/>
<br/>
That's great that you are getting your sister into letterboxing too! <br/>
I have really wished that my sister's would be interested, but they <br/>
are not the type to enjoy letterboxing... but I have been working on <br/>
my niece. LOL! They all live quite a way from me, though, so I don't <br/>
see them very often.<br/>
<br/>
Your stamping adventures sound like a lot of fun, despite the rain, <br/>
lack of compass, lack of gloves for reaching in slimy stumps, <br/>
etc. ;) I wish I had been into letterboxing when we went on vacation <br/>
in June - LA, MS, AL, GA, SC, NC.... sigh... <br/>
<br/>
It's so great to hear your excitement and that your creativity is <br/>
flowing with ideas for your own boxes. I have planted more boxes <br/>
yesterday, and now have more clues to write. I also have several <br/>
ideas for series stamps, and have carved the first in two of them... <br/>
now to carve the rest. <br/>
<br/>
I am relieved to say that my carving has improved greatly. <br/>
Whheeewww! For me, it was much easier to use an exacto knife for <br/>
carving, and then the speedball thing for details only. It made an <br/>
HUGE and immediate difference! <br/>
