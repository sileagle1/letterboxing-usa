<br/>
I am writing you regarding a serious situation that has occurred at <br/>
my high school.  No doubt you have followed the story in the news of <br/>
our missing mascot, Inky.  Inky escaped three weeks ago while his <br/>
keeper was cleaning his cage.  There have been several unconfirmed <br/>
Inky sightings since his disappearance but none of them has panned <br/>
out.   The students in my school are taking Inky's disappearance very <br/>
hard.   The basketball team has not won a game since his <br/>
disappearance.  Members of the student body mill around the school <br/>
grounds commiserating about Inky.  No one is getting any schoolwork <br/>
done.  If Inky is not found soon the entire senior class is in <br/>
jeopardy of not graduating and the basketball team will not make the <br/>
playoffs.  I have been investigating Inky's disappearance but I am <br/>
afraid his trail has gone cold.  He always seems to be 2 steps ahead <br/>
of me. I have run out of ideas and time. Final exams are next week. <br/>
Here are the clues I have pieced together so far.<br/>
<br/>
1. Mr. Bud E. C. Ancee, who lives across the street from Memorial <br/>
park, claims to have heard strange noises in the woods behind his <br/>
house.<br/>
2. Brenda aRussilliano noticed unusually large paw prints along the <br/>
nature trail where she jogs.<br/>
3. A town worker named Guido while walking his Beagle, Bessie, saw <br/>
strange scratches along a rock.  It seems that Guido &amp; Bessie were <br/>
out for their usually walk in the Town Forest.  Just after they <br/>
crossed the small stream on the SW side of the second pond Bessie ran <br/>
off after something.  Guido assumed it was just another rabbit.  <br/>
Guido followed Bessie along the trail that goes west from the pond.  <br/>
At the place where the trail starts to swing around to the east, <br/>
Guido spied Bessie through a break in the stone that runs along the <br/>
north side of the trail.  As he passed through this break in the wall <br/>
Guido turned to the left and noticed strange claw marks along the <br/>
stone wall about 3 feet before a large tree.  After pausing to <br/>
examine the claw marks, Guido called Bessie back and continued along <br/>
the trail back to his car.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will help us find Inky before it's too late.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Your Nephew,<br/>
