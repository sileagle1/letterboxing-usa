<div>
<div>     Recently, I was contacted by the Smithsonian. Seems that they, too, have been made aware of our presence by the Washington Post article, and were pretty interested in what their April '98 article had spawned. I believe that a follow up article, or blurb anyway, is in the works. The most amazing thing is that the correspondent I talked with knew of the first Kmartha prank, and was more than a little amused by my remarks about it someday ending up in the Institution's archives of Americana. She passed the joke on to one of the curators at the American Art Museum, who specializes in American Folk Art. She was also charmed, and contacted me, inquiring about the piece! </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>     I had a really interesting discussion with her about folk art, and my take on the whole letterboxing thing. While I'd be tickled to have any of my work as part of the collection, I convinced her that such a piece should be dynamic, interactive, and discreet... a <em>real</em> letterbox placed within the Smithsonian, that people could find, stamp in, collect the stamp, and be part of it... after a time, it could be put on display or added to the archives for future display. 
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>     So there it is. Your chance to be a small part of history and folk art in America, not to mention a highly collectible piece of legerdemaine. It'll be in place until the beginning of April, and then become part of the Smithsonian archives. I'd like to thank Chief Curator, Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, for allowing me, and the community, this once in a lifetime opportunity, and specifically for being receptive to my suggestions regarding how this be put forth. </p>
<div>     The letterbox is located in the Smithsonian Castle.  Use the handicap entrance on the Washington Monument side of the front entrance.  Note the old Smithsonian lamppost letterbox on display directly to the right of the doorway when you enter.  The letterbox is a 35mm mini.  It is attached to the underside of the water fountain to the left of the doorway with Velcro.  It should go without saying that suspicious behaviour in a federal building will likely ruin your day, so be discreet, and take it to a remote spot for stamping up, and return it later. </div></div></div></div></div><br clear="all"/><hr/> <a href="http://g.msn.com/8HMMEN/2015">the new MSN 8</a> and get 2 months FREE*

We got a carving kit at Total Crafts and it came with carving tools that are safer than using an x-acto knife.  Red Cricket, who's 6, has decided that he wants his own stamp, a Pokemon picture he draws, and I'm going to let him carve his own with the fine carving tool in this kit, and with my help.  Mother of Crickets</body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; P.S.  We were thinking about doing a Pokemon themed box where you<br/>
&gt; would have to answer multiple choice questions about Pokemon to<br/>
&gt; determine the direction to head, number of steps, etc.  If you all<br/>
&gt; live in the NOVA area, that would mean at least one set of boxer's<br/>
&gt; bound to find the box!<br/>
<br/>
You know, for some bizarre reason I was bored one day and carved five <br/>
stamps of Pokemon characters.  Now I know absolutely nothing about <br/>
Pokemon.  I can't even tell you the names of these characters!  But <br/>
they looked cute, so I figured I'd carve them.  They really are <br/>
pretty good stamps, but I haven't a clue what to do with them.  I <br/>
can't exactly HIDE them not knowing anything about the characters.  <br/>
I've considered giving them away to kids that might like to have them <br/>
as signature stamps, but then it just seems wrong to have other <br/>
people using MY stamps as signature stamps.  Everyone should be <br/>
carving their own.  So what do I do with these five stamps?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I like the idea of your Pokemon themed box(es), and I'd be <br/>
willing to donate these stamps to such a worthy cause!  Of course, <br/>
I'll NEVER be able to find the stamps myself because I know so little <br/>
about Pokemon, but I like the idea anyhow.  =)<br/>
<br/>
The five that I have are (and since I don't know their names, I'm <br/>
just describing them):<br/>
<br/>
1. Looks like a ball of purple worms<br/>
2. Looks kindof like a seahorse<br/>
3. Looks like a cat with spiked hair<br/>
4. Looks like a turtle of some sort<br/>
5. Not sure what the last one looks like.  A bat, perhaps?  With <br/>
elephant-sized ears that looks like he could fly with.<br/>

pictures anymore so I just see my black-and-white stamps now.  I only <br/>
remembered the big ball of worms being very purple, but I don't <br/>

Please enlighten: What and where is the Einstein letterbox? I <br/>
don't find it listed anyplace.<br/>
And yes, collecting the Smithsonian stamp is cool, just walking <br/>
through the bag-check with it in your pocket! No one seemed to <br/>

plenty of benches there. A fun box all around.<br/>

I was worried that Egypt and Nat. Geographic would not last long.  <br/>
I'll check it out.<br/>

&gt; &gt; OK, well Tammy and I braved the holiday traffic Saturday and <br/>
&gt; went to <br/>
&gt; &gt; DC!  The Smithsonian box is so cool!  I felt like a spy <br/>
&gt; &gt; surreptitiously pocketing the canister and then casually <br/>
&gt; walking past <br/>
&gt; &gt; the guards to sit in the lobby, out of the rain to stamp in!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; While we were there we found the Einstein box and tried for the <br/>
&gt; one <br/>
&gt; &gt; at the National Geographic offices, but it was missing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Have fun everyone, these are great!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please enlighten: What and where is the Einstein letterbox? I <br/>
&gt; don't find it listed anyplace.<br/>
&gt; And yes, collecting the Smithsonian stamp is cool, just walking <br/>
&gt; through the bag-check with it in your pocket! No one seemed to <br/>
&gt; pay any attention to what I was doing in the lobby, and there are <br/>
&gt; plenty of benches there. A fun box all around.<br/>

                    <html><body><div><div>     This box (and many others, of late) has been erroneously reported as missing before.  It seems that since you must take the box away for a while and stamp, that people have missed it because others had it out.  However, this last round of reports is disturbing.  Either the box has been extremely busy (and it has) or someone has absconded with it.  It may also be possible that the Smithsonian people took it in for some reason.  I will contact them and see if this is the case, and if not, have them look for it when the Castle is closed, to see if it is really gone.</div>

looks like the Smithsonian box is gone.<br/>
