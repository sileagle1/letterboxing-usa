&gt;Let this thread die.  I haven't tried to offend anyone.  And anyone<br/>
&gt;who claims not to have a favorite boxes is about as honest as<br/>
&gt;Bill Clinton.  I have favorite boxes, and so does everyone else on<br/>
&gt;this board.  I just happened to be the unlucky fellow to mention<br/>
&gt;them.  *rolling eyes*<br/>
<br/>
Nobody said we don't have favorite boxes, Ryan.  I'm quite fond of the <br/>
Fauntleroy box and the Camp Long box, myself.  (Among others...)  However, <br/>
it wasn't that you mentioned your favorites, it's that you dismissed the <br/>
rest as cruddy, and went so far over into the Male Chauvenist Pig arena as <br/>
to start bringing in...what was it?....Roseann Barr and Meg Ryan as a <br/>
comparison.  (And we won't even go there as to why -that- is offensive.  To <br/>
use your logic, you should go on over and take a women's studies class <br/>
sometimes if you take offense.)<br/>
<br/>
Mentioning favorites is not a problem. Mentioning that the rest are <br/>
crap...now THAT is a problem.  Especially since, as far as I can recall <br/>
from the boxes I've been getting lately, you haven't been here in quite <br/>
some time and wouldn't know what you're talking about.  To clarify <br/>
further:  being honest as a politician isn't falling on those who were <br/>
offended; it's about you digging yourself in further with every post, and <br/>
showing off your ignorance in the process.<br/>
<br/>
 From now on, you're filtering to the trash.  Thread dead on my <br/>
end.  Whoever said that ALL stamps are treasure -- you're on my Cool List.<br/>
