If you are concerned about non-members posting instructions,<br/>
make the webserver a member 'ie., system@lbna.com,<br/>
and put a form on the website that forwards to the list.<br/>
<br/>
here is a question about the website.<br/>
are there urls that take you directly to the archive page<br/>
or do you need to go to the main page and click 'join' everytime.<br/>
I was trying to set up the current archive page to dl to my pda<br/>
and I couldn't get a direct url.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a suggestion for future development.<br/>
we translate and post hints as .pdb files or .doc files so that<br/>
they can be downloaded to pda so you can dl regional hints for<br/>
wherever you are going in mass and have them at your fingertips.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt;If we allow only members to post, how will people who don't subscribe to <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;email list post clues for boxes they have hidden?<br/>
