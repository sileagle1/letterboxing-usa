yesterday! Made even more beautiful by the lovely spirits of Deanne and Dave <br/>
from Mass! What a fun couple of letterboxers! <br/>
<br/>
Mimulus, Paul from SF. 3vix and we two gathered for a several-box hunt, most <br/>
of them Mimulus's fabulous stamps and another splendid one from Paul.<br/>
<br/>
To those of you easterners who know or have boxed with Deanne and Dave you <br/>
know why we instantly fell in love with them. Lovely people they are! Thanks for <br/>
sharing them with us out here on the LEFT coast. And thanks for taking the <br/>
time to box with us, Dave and "Luvvy"!<br/>
<br/>
For those of you in the vicinity, seek out any boxes in the wine country <br/>
carved by Mimulus and ANY by Paul from SF. You won't be disappointed!<br/>
