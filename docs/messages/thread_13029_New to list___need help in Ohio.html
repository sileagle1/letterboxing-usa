                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, my name is Layni &amp; I live in the Cincinnati, OH area.  I've been <br/>
letterboxing for about 2 years 'unofficially' (by this I mean, I'll <br/>
head out, find a box &amp; not be able to log it because I've either <br/>
forgotten our stamp, log book, pen, etc...we have been known to rub a <br/>
stick in the dirt just to write in a book we find, yeah, pretty <br/>
ghetto...but all that's about to change.)  I'm finally ready to <br/>
commit to doing this right.  We'll be camping at Hueston Woods in a <br/>
few weeks &amp; I know that there used to be boxes placed there but can't <br/>
seem to locate them online anymore.  I'm also having trouble with <br/>
Letterboxing.org, it continues to give me error messages every time I <br/>
click on my area.  If anyone is in my area (or has been) &amp; knows of <br/>
any boxes in Hueston Woods (College Corner, OH) I would really <br/>
appreciate any help.  We're camping with some friends that have never <br/>
letterboxed before &amp; they're really stoked &amp; now there's no <br/>
boxes???!  Thanks in advance for any help.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I, too, have problems clicking on the specific area on the Ohio map.  So, <br/>
click on "Search Boxes" and select Ohio.  You will then have to go through all <br/>
the Ohio boxes and there are many in the Cincinnati area.  I am from Columbus, <br/>
myself, and we don't have as many as you do!  I need to get out there and plant <br/>
a box or two myself!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  Are you planning to go to the gathering on June 16?  It is close <br/>
to you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll have to search the archives for meeting info...too new to know about it (or not paying attention one...which is entirely possible) We're leaving for Sandusky (Cedar Point) on the 18th so that may be pushing it.  Unfortunately, even though we're camping, we'll be doing no LB'ing...it's a short trip &amp; it's already choked with things to do(which is a bummer, because I saw there were quite a few in the area)  Oh, well. Maybe we'll place one at the campground (is that legal?) Thanks again for the info Betsy.<br/>
