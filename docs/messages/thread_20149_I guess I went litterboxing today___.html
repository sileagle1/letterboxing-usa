                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning I printed out the clues to about 10 or so different <br/>
letterboxes, grabbed my gear, my dog, and my dog's gear (tennis ball <br/>
&amp; leash) and headed out. The first letterbox on my list was the <br/>
Repetto Ranch Raid letterbox in Buzzard's Tiburcio Vasquez series. I <br/>
found the box with no problem and sat under a shady tree with my dog <br/>
to stamp in. While stamping in I noticed a dirty box under another <br/>
tree about 50 feet away. It looked out of place since the park is <br/>
somewhat of a playground and very pristine. I decided to check it out <br/>
once I rehid the letterbox. As I got closer I noticed there were some <br/>
flies swarming around the top and I immediately thought there was a <br/>
dead animal inside. When my dog, who was about six feet ahead of me, <br/>
starting whining as she approached the box, I knew what was in there. <br/>
Kittens, four of them. They looked up at me with their blurry little <br/>
eyes. I love animals so there was no question in my mind what I would <br/>
do. I picked up the box and noticed that it was totally infested with <br/>
ants. Fortunately I had a clean box in my car to put them in, and <br/>
later today they will be checked out at the vet thanks to a great <br/>
rescue group called the Paw'd Squad here in Burbank, CA. The group is <br/>
already inundated with homeless cats (one of their members is <br/>
fostering over 90 cats in their home!) so it looks like these guys <br/>
will be staying with me for a while. Free kittens, anyone?<br/>

Do you count their box as a four box series or just one with four stamps. So is it Larry, Moe, Curly and Shemp? Now that sounds like an excuse for a box to me. <br/>

little conjunctivitis, they are in great shape. There are two boys <br/>

kittens, and I'm sure they will miss my dog, whom they have adopted <br/>
as their new mommy :)    -Q<br/>

The kittens were checked out and guessed to be about 5 weeks old - a <br/>
little too young to be separated from their mom, but aside from a <br/>
little conjunctivitis, they are in great shape. There are two boys <br/>
and two girls, and unfortunately 3 are black (black cats have a tough <br/>
time finding good homes.) The other one is grey and he is the <br/>
smartest - he's the one I named Buzzard (after the planter of the <br/>
letterbox.) On Saturday they will go to a foster who takes care of <br/>
kittens, and I'm sure they will miss my dog, whom they have adopted <br/>
as their new mommy :)    -Q<br/>

I have a black cat named Arria. She was named after a Roman woman <br/>
whose husband was sentenced to death. At his execution she grabbed a <br/>
dagger, ran up to her husband, and said "See, my love, it does not <br/>
hurt". My little Arria is very brave :-)<br/>

to her name. She was the runt but she sure makes up for it. Swinging <br/>
from the curtains, ripping the arms off the couch, jumping on you <br/>
back as you walk by.........Yes she is loved!!!<br/>
