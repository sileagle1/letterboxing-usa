We had a chat gathering Sat at 9 p.m. There were 5-6 people in the <br/>
room. 1 N.J. several Ct. Where were the rest of you ?  Oh well next <br/>
time.  Nothing to technical to report we had a little fun when the <br/>
room decided to multiply us, I thought cloning was reserved for cows <br/>
and sheep! Most of the talk centered around boxes we had done or <br/>
recommended. I was looking for more public space open at night for a <br/>
second night box. N.J. has been  doing a set of Ct.  We should try <br/>
his it is not that far, they sound good too. We talked about the <br/>
Connecticut concentration  and why here( lucky us) We just feel good <br/>
stuff rubs off. The more we do the more others enjoy then they want <br/>
to plant too. That is why we need to get these other states going , <br/>
imagine where it could lead. Well I'l try to remember more but now <br/>
it's chore time here. Anyone care to add any? Go ahead. Carol<br/>

Perhaps, there should be a designated time (or 2, or 3) for people to <br/>
chat.<br/>
<br/>
I designate now! I'll be logged into the chat room for the next hour <br/>
if anyone cares to join me.<br/>

Thanks for joining me Smiley, Dos Locos, &amp; Busy Bee!<br/>
<br/>
It was great to chat with other Letterboxers. Dos Locos and I have <br/>
decided to make a weekly thing of it.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone would care to join us next week, we will be chatting again <br/>
on Thursday at 4:00 PDT. That's: 7:00 EDT, 6:00 CDT, &amp; 5:00 MDT.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to chatting with others next week!<br/>
