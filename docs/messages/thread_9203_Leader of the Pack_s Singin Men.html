<div><span class="200201515-16112002">        Got the clue sheets for Singin 
Men late yesterday and went over the clues last night. We left the 
house at first day light to beat the rain and started off in search of 
the Singin Men. Had to give some thought to a couple of the clues but 
we were able to find it. We were proud and happy to be the first 
to sign in, just beating the rain. </span></div>

<div><span class="200201515-16112002">        The clues to Singin Men are 
not available on line . They can be given to you by a friend or you might find 
them in another letterbox.The clues travel like a hitch hiker. Use the clues 
when you get them. Put them back in their bag and deposit them at another 
letterbox when you are out again. Or pass them to a friend. The clues are 
not in words but in pictures with meanings. If read correctly they make perfect 
sense, if not, they can be a mind teaser. This was a thank you box 
from Leader of the Pack to Pete and Wanda. It was a nice inovation in writing 
clues. Clues are on their way to another letterboxer. Leader of the Pack did a 
wonderful hand carved stamp. Great job Carolyn! Thank you. We had a great time 
finding it.....Chuck, Molly,
