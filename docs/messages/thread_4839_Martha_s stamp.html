<p>      Thank you to all who responded to my urgent request RE: Martha Stewart. I'm afraid that I wasn't clear enough when I asked that people <strong>'post their disapproval'</strong>. I'm dismayed that so many people have posted their disapproval of her personally. Really, is there any need of that? I have found her to be pleasant (until she got huffy), and she has a fine, self-deprecating wit. I've scanned her personal stamp image from one of my box's journals... and I hope that she will forgive me for this broach of decorum... but you really must see this. You'll have a new appreciation for her:</p></div></div></div></div><br clear="all"/><hr/>Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at <a href="http://g.msn.com/1HM305401/13">http://explorer.msn.com</a>.<br/>
