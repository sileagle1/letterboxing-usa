Danville, VT<br/>
Caledonia County<br/>
<br/>
Easy<br/>
<br/>
One-half of a mile down Brainerd Street from the Danville Green is the<br/>
cemetery. Just passed the cemetery is an old railroad cut. Pull over and<br/>
park.<br/>
<br/>
On the same side of the street as the cemetery, stand on the first wooden<br/>
railroad tie that is visible. <br/>
<br/>
For each word in the song Ive Been Working on the Railroad, advance to<br/>
the next wooden railroad tie. <br/>
<br/>
Go through the entire song three times. <br/>
<br/>
Look in the woods to your right, and you will see an old, metal bucket, left<br/>
there long ago by some railroad worker.<br/>
<br/>
Look under the bucket.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
- Please bring your own pen and ink pad.<br/>
- Dont worry if you mis-count a railroad tie or two. Close is close <br/>
  enough.<br/>
- Fiddley - I - Oh counts as three words.<br/>
- The railroad is a snow machine trail in the winter. This box is <br/>
  inaccessible when there is snow cover.<br/>
- Please replace the letterbox under the bucket as you found it.<br/>
- Make sure to check out the nearby letterboxes Cemetery Walk <br/>
  and Covered Bridge.<br/>
