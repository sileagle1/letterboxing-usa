Being into making my own cards and such, I would think archival ink would  be <br/>
the best bet.<br/>
It's quick drying, fade resistant, waterproof, permanent.  <br/>
<br/>
Dye ink is fast drying too but it's not too fade resistant and it's not  <br/>
waterproof.<br/>
<br/>
For what it's worth, archival inkpads should be stored upside down.   So <br/>
should dye inkpads.  Pigment inkpads should be stored right side  up.<br/>

Actually, I've been finding it more and more common that the folks <br/>
working at the rubber stamp stores know about letterboxing.  They <br/>
may not be letterboxers nor know all the ins and outs of <br/>
letterboxing, but they generally *have* heard of it at this point.  <br/>
At least they have in the stamp stores I've been hitting.<br/>

requiring us to stamp the book with the metallic ink in the <br/>
letterbox.  This wasn't a problem except that the metallic ink was <br/>
now all over our personal stamps and it took many stampings with the <br/>
ink we normally use to get the original color back.  :-(  <br/>
Unfortunately, the metallic ink was pigment and thus didn't wash off <br/>
the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, however, we've found the metallic inks to be rather <br/>
neat -- and appropriate for the stamp image.  They do seem to be <br/>
popular, though!<br/>

Pigment inks are only permanent after being heated with a heating <br/>
tool.  Pigment is a thicker ink as opposed to dye based ink which <br/>
leaves a crisper image.  I stay away from pigment because because of <br/>
the heat/permanency issue.  :) Just my $.02 worth!<br/>

Sounds like you were a very good sport about it though!  You must <br/>

&gt; Ah, yes, we came across a logbook recently with black pages ... <br/>
&gt; requiring us to stamp the book with the metallic ink in the <br/>
&gt; letterbox.  This wasn't a problem except that the metallic ink was <br/>
&gt; now all over our personal stamps and it took many stampings with <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; ink we normally use to get the original color back.  :-(  <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, the metallic ink was pigment and thus didn't wash <br/>
off <br/>
&gt; the stamp.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In some cases, however, we've found the metallic inks to be rather <br/>
&gt; neat -- and appropriate for the stamp image.  They do seem to be <br/>
&gt; popular, though!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The advantage of using pigment is that it is waterproof.  If <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp dye ink in a letterbox's logbook and the logbook gets <br/>
wet, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; well, goodbye stamp.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Pigment will take a little longer to dry, but I've found that <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; varies depending on the type of paper.<br/>
