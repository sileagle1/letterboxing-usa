When my kids were young we would stand in the living room dancing to <br/>
this music, jumping from compass point to compass point. This was <br/>
before boxing. I can't believe I never thought of it afterwards. <br/>

I am still a big fan of R.E.M.'s Radio Free Europe', and 'Gardening <br/>

Chorus:<br/>
Dont go around tonight,<br/>
Well, its bound to take your life,<br/>
Theres a bad moon on the rise.<br/>
<br/>
I hear hurricanes ablowing.<br/>
I know the end is coming soon.<br/>
I fear rivers over flowing.<br/>
I hear the voice of rage and ruin.<br/>
<br/>
Chorus<br/>
All right!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you got your things together.<br/>
Hope you are quite prepared to die.<br/>
Looks like were in for nasty weather.<br/>
One eye is taken for an eye.<br/>
<br/>

There's a wacky little song by They Might be Giants called "letterbox".....<br/>
Here are the lyrics...  The first line is great!  The rest is open to <br/>
interpretation as to whether it's an appropriate anthem!<br/>
<br/>
I'll never know what you'll find when you open up your letter box tomorrow<br/>
'cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know, she's my best<br/>
Friend, she's a sparrow<br/>
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know when you know<br/>
What you are, o.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a pair of eyes on the back of my head for each time<br/>
You forgot to take out all the things you forgot to talk about when you took a<br/>
Bite out of my spine,<br/>
I would have a lot of eyes on the other side, wouldn't i? wouldn't that just be<br/>
Fine.<br/>
<br/>
Too late or soon to make noise about love and there's no time for sorrow<br/>
Run around in the rain with a hole in the brain till tomorrow<br/>
<br/>
I'll never know what you'll find when you open up your letter box tomorrow<br/>
'cause a little bird never tells me anything I want to know, she's my best<br/>
Friend, she's a sparrow<br/>
And I'll never never know what you never never never want to know when you know<br/>
What you are, o.<br/>
