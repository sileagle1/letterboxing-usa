&gt;. I guess it wouldn't work with me because I'm not even sure of the <br/>

&gt;remember not really getting it so I guess that's probably why I <br/>
&gt;don't remember. But hey, whatever works I guess.<br/>

I think the question was "which was is north?" and the if they say <br/>
"UP", they're a letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't make any sense to me, either.  Because in my pre-letter <br/>
boxing days, I'd have said UP as a smart-ass answer.  But, now, if I <br/>
didn't really know which way is north, I'd probably say, "I don't <br/>
know, let me get out my compass".  LOL.<br/>
