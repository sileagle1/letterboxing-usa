                    <div class="plaintext-content">On March 16, 2002 Funhog placed the Nature's Magic Letterbox in Kearney,<br/>
Buffalo County, Nebraska. A converted railroad bed has found new life as a<br/>
hike/bike trail at Fort Kearney State Recreation Area. This is a wonderful<br/>
place to see 90% of the world's Sandhill Cranes during spring migration,<br/>
mid March to mid April. The spectacle of 500,000 birds lifting off the<br/>
Platte at sunrise defies description.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: From Kearney head South on route 44 across the Platte<br/>
River and follow the signs to Fort Kearney SRA. Don't be misled by the<br/>
Historic Park, you want the Recreation Area. There is a small fee to enter<br/>
the park. Park at the hike/bike trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: Walk along the path to the abode of the Northern Troll,<br/>
guardian of the letterbox. He loves to sit with his back against a three<br/>
trunked tree gazing at his concrete vault. He counts the people as they<br/>
pass the third post, directly above his treasure.<br/>
