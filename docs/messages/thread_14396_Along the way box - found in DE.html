<br/>
just wanted to report that i have just found the "along the way" lb <br/>
placed by spring chick.  so now i'm F7P0X0!<br/>
<br/>
the box was in excellent shape, the gulls and redwinged black birds <br/>
were quite noisy, the sheep flies were quite annoying, the poor <br/>
horseshoe crabs that had laid their eggs and died were quite smelly, <br/>
but the scenery and the shell i found was quite wonderful!  enjoying <br/>
my trip to deleware!  thanks spring chick!<br/>
<br/>
