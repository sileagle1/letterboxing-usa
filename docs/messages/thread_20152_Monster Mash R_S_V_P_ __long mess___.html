month from tomorrow we will all be meeting, greeting, eating, <br/>
exchanging, and hunting down some creepy letterboxes. <br/>
  I need to get a head count..no, not a SEVERED head, but an INTACT <br/>
head count. The Mash hosts/hostesses would appreciate  having some <br/>
idea of how many plan to attend so they can have enough hotdogs, <br/>
papergoods, etc. at hand.  Please bring a potluck dish to share if <br/>
you can. (No electricity available though). <br/>
  Even if you have e-mailed the sponsers of this event, please <br/>
contact me. We are trying to come up with one all-inclusive list of <br/>
Mashers. Would you please list the first names of everyone in your <br/>
party, plus last initials (if you don't mind) and l.b. nicknames? <br/>
Bringing any 4-footed pals? Let me know that too. <br/>
  I think it would be great to have a list which includes all of you <br/>
(no last names), plus the town (or at least) state you are from.  If <br/>
you are o.k. with that, let me know and I'll send this list out to <br/>
attendees after the fact. (Or may be before).<br/>

Hopefully our head, err attendance count will be 2 adults Ken T. and Laura T. (Papa and Mama Bear) and Mikayla (Baby Bear).  We are hoping that there will be no children with us-gotta bribe a grandparent to keep them!<br/>
