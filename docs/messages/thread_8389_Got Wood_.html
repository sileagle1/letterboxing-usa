<div>It is my husband who works for the yacht 
builder so I have a free supply of scrap wood for the asking.  He just 
brought me home half a dozen little blocks - and he cuts and smooths them for me 
too.  Thanks for the suggestions on types of wood and which lasts 
best.  I trust the teak as it is used for decks on these particular 
boats.  Yes,  I am spoiled and he is very intrigued and enjoying 
letterboxing.  He informed me that I would have had another find yesterday 
if he had been along.  I told him he'll be making that hike with me next 
weekend and can prove himself!</div>

    As usual, good suggestions are surfacing.  I use a 6 x 8" piece <br/>
of plastic window-covering, carried over from orienteering practice, <br/>
to clip the clue sheet to for carrying in the field and later for a <br/>
stamping-in platform, if needed (which is often).  And, since I use a <br/>
looseleaf 3.5 x 5" Strathmore SKETCH  book for a journal (same as I <br/>
put in my letterboxes), I can merely tear out the page if I don't get <br/>
a satisfactory impression the first time.  That's occurred several <br/>
times.  <br/>
    I'd consider backing up my stamps with wood, except that the <br/>
Rubbermaid size A boxes I use don't have any too much room in 'em.  <br/>
No question that the rigid stamp provides a more certain complete <br/>
image (but perhaps only if you have a firm surface to work on).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too use only the thin carving material and mount all of my stamps <br/>
on wood.  Oak is also a good choice for durable wood blocks.  <br/>
OldShoe's father does carpentry work and has a barrel full of 3/4" <br/>
oak scraps.  He has cut them into various sizes and even routered the <br/>
edges for the little grippers for me.  I have a whole box full in my <br/>
garage and just choose whichever one best fits the stamp I have <br/>
carved... sand the edges lightly, stamp my image on one side and afix <br/>
the stamp with rubber cement on the other side.  They look quite nice <br/>
when complete, and the image is nice and even.<br/>
<br/>
** One tip for stamping your image onto the wood block (of course you <br/>
are going to do this before you glue the stamp to the wood).  Ink <br/>
your stamp and then lay it INK SIDE UP on a flat, stable surface like <br/>
a table or countertop, then press your wood block firmly down onto <br/>
it.  This gives a much cleaner impression than if you stamp the block <br/>
from on top **<br/>

I take a piece of 3x5 acrylic block with me when I go box hunting.  I can<br/>
use it to back any kind of carving material I find.  It fits in my fanny<br/>
