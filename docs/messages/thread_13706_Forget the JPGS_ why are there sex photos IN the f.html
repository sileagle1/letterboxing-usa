WOW - I agree that those photos need to be removed immediately and I <br/>
certainly don't want my sons to get exposed to that garbage but I really doubt that a <br/>
moderator on this list is leaving them on on purpose.  It's probably that they <br/>
just don't know that stuff is there.  This list has incredibly heavy traffic <br/>
and the website was just redone for all of us and I believe that everyone <br/>
working on it is doing it out of the goodness of their hearts and not for any <br/>
remuneration.<br/>
I think it would have been a lot more effective if you had just made them <br/>
aware that it was there and needed to be removed and didn't immediately begin <br/>
accusing people of purposely putting porn on to lure children to look at it. And <br/>
threatening to complain to the FBI - please!  That's just outrageous overkill. <br/>
<br/>
Are you the sort of person who kicks the cat when they get a flat tire?  Have <br/>
trouble getting along with your neighbors? Road rage?  Chill out!<br/>
