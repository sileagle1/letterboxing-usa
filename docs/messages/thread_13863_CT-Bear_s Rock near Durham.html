The Mountain Laurels were in full bloom and the trail was a fairy-land of white and pale pink. In addition, the view is not to be missed. <br/>
<br/>
This box, placed in 2000, has a nice stamp, is in good shape and hasn't had many visitors lately. Take a few moments to look through the logbook at all the box finders' marvelous stamps that have come to grace its pages over the last three years.<br/>
<br/>
Jay, this one's a gem. Thanks for a perfect evening! <br/>

Last evening, my letterboxing partner and I took the short hike to <br/>
Bear's Rock near Durham. Since it stays light so late in the <br/>
evening, this Drew Clan letterbox can easily be done after work. <br/>
