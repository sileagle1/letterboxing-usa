and motored up to Columbus to look for a few boxes we've had our eyes<br/>
on for a long time.  <br/>
<br/>
Started out at Griggs Reservior and quickly found Franzsolo's box<br/>
right where it was supposed to be.  Congratulations Franz - this is<br/>
one of the best letterbox placements I've ever seen.  Whole park full<br/>
of people everywhere yet we were able to take a few steps, locate the<br/>
box, comfortably stamp in on a picnic table, and put the box back with<br/>
nobody there having any idea what we were doing.  It was great! <br/>
Logbook's almost full BTW - if you're headed up that way anytime soon<br/>
you'll probably want to service it.<br/>
<br/>
We then moved to the other end of the park and located Thumpa Thumpa.<br/>
 Another nice box in a nice spot.  It's had a lot of visitors too and<br/>
could use some maintenance soon.  It was kind of exciting to carry the<br/>
box all the way out to a table and then discover it had been colonized<br/>
by ants!  They weren't too happy to be displaced but we cleaned them<br/>
out and put it back.<br/>
<br/>
Then up the road a little further to Field of Corn - one of the Art In<br/>
Public Places boxes we've been wanting to find.  It also is badly in<br/>
need of maintenance - the plastic bottle had been overstuffed with<br/>
additional logsheets until it shattered and the stamp had been broken<br/>
and repaired previously.  We bagged the whole soggy mess and pt it<br/>
back.  I know Floatflute doesn't seem to be active anymore but<br/>
hopefully someone has adopted this box.  It's too nice a spot not to<br/>
have one.  Regretably, no sign of Succotash in this same park.<br/>
<br/>
Then on further to Watch House - another of the Art In Public Places<br/>
series.  Very cool sculpture and a nice letterbox too.  CardinalMom<br/>
fought off the ants this time and we enjoyed looking at all the<br/>
different stamps in this logbook.  This box will need attention soon<br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
A few miles further and we looked for Leatherlips among a few million<br/>
cicadas.  It's amazing - we hadn't seen one all day  and then it's as<br/>
if we drove across some invisible line and they were everywhere. <br/>
TrailBuddy hated them and bid a hasty retreat to the car.  CardinalMom<br/>
and I each looked but were unable to locate the box.  Too bad - a<br/>
place this cool needs one!<br/>
<br/>
Then back down the road toward home with a brief detour in Chillicothe<br/>
to look for a couple of new boxes by Salamander.  We found Not Yet-i<br/>
with no trouble and were pleased to be first finders but when we<br/>
looked for Beaglemania we were surprized to find the whole bush where<br/>
it was supposed to be gone and no trace of the box.  I think she only<br/>
planted it a couple of weeks ago but I fear it didn't live long.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all enjoyed the holiday and got to do some 'boxing too!<br/>
