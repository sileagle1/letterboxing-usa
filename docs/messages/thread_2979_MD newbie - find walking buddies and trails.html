<br/>
I'm a newbie too, and decided, like you, the best way to get letterboxing <br/>
going around here is to plant some....my 3rd one is about to go in.<br/>
<br/>
Go to www.ava.org and click on "find a club" and then to Maryland, and you <br/>
will find walking clubs there...generally you don't have to join one (but <br/>
why not?), but you'll meet people who like to walk and hike.  And some of us <br/>
discovered letterboxing through the yahoo Walklist...so maybe you'll find <br/>
both soon.<br/>
<br/>
AVA means American Volkssport Association, and it is composed of about 500 <br/>
clubs all over the US which hold non-competitive, leisurely sporting events <br/>
(mostly walking, although there are swims, bikes, and cross-country skiing) <br/>
for people of average athletic ability.<br/>
<br/>
The AVA walks are all 10k (some longer) loops.  I use ours in NC to plant <br/>
letterboxes.  Some of the walks are special events (once a year, etc.), but <br/>
there are about 1,600 "permanent" trails all over.  Have fun!<br/>
