Today I got the U of CA Davis box.<br/>
I first tried last week and took a wrong turn.<br/>
Today I jumped ahead to where I made the mistake and then<br/>
off I went.<br/>
I got on the right track and ended up near the box.<br/>
Today was cleaning day! there were people everywhere.<br/>
I was able to retrieve the box and opened the journal.<br/>
I was First! I stamped up and went to put the box back<br/>
There were people sitting right beside the location!!!<br/>
I had to wait until they shut the door and the cleaners moved<br/>
away.<br/>
I put the box back quickly and left the area.....<br/>
Phew... this cloak and dagger stuff is murder..<br/>
<br/>
Is the placer of the Davis Box on-line, If so I would love to ask a couple <br/>
questions about your clues? I want to make sure I got them all right.<br/>
<br/>
Matt<br/>
