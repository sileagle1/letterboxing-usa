Alright everyone, the clues have been updated to reflect the <br/>
correct "navigation numbers".<br/>
<br/>
I have also added one more thing to the end of the clues that may be <br/>
of interest to all. <br/>
<br/>
"Box the Globe"<br/>

&gt; Newbe1, I enjoyed my visit to Chinatown in honor of the Chinese <br/>
&gt; Lunar new year.  It is always worth the trip to Chinatown to pass <br/>
&gt; under the arch.  Very nice stamp.  I would say it was a challenging <br/>
&gt; microbox but somehow I radared right to it.  I will be interested <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; hear how others fare.  It was fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the way the numbers are 80 P6 X2 and not P"2".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Be discreet?!  While you are doing something your Mother would yell <br/>
&gt; at you for?!  You know what I mean.  It must have looked very <br/>
&gt; amusing trying to act non-chalant while retreiving and replacing <br/>
&gt; this one.  Actually I think I did pretty well.  I felt like a young <br/>
&gt; guy on a movie date looking elsewhere while non-chalantly reaching <br/>
&gt; with my arm in a different direction.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Because it was snowing (yeah I'm crazy) I went into CVS to stamp <br/>
in, <br/>
&gt; using some boxes as a table.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am almost surprised I didn't run into Mary from Virginia looking <br/>
&gt; for the microbox too.  Well except for the snow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the fun,<br/>
