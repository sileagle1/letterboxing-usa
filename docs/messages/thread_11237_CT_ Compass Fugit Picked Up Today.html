Hammopnasset and along with hundreds of other folks. walked the beach. <br/>
We stamped into Marco Man just after Rubaduc. and also, hunt as we did, <br/>
we never found Maine Man. We will return !! Sadie and Russ, the Marco <br/>
Man Stamp is beautiful, you did a great job.  Now if only  we can find <br/>
Maine Man ?? hint <br/>
This Morning Bluebird joined us as we planted four boxes to honor Lobsta <br/>
's birthday. She got to help plant !<br/>
Tomorrow I will work on the clues, but will tell you they are in Chaney <br/>
Ranch along with two others of Wanda and Pete.  So six boxes in this <br/>
interesting Nature Preserve may just get some folks out enjoying the area.  <br/>
