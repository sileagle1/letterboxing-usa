12:30pm today.  I found the velcro for the microbox but no box. :-( <br/>
Tried again on the way back at 1:30pm with no luck.<br/>
<br/>
I work in downtown D.C. and can get to the Smithsonian most any day <br/>
easily.  I would be happy to restore it or check it if needed.  <br/>

Meanwhile their is still plenty of snow around the mall and possibly <br/>
more on the way.  The Sunday forecast calls for rain.  Ugh.  Love <br/>
snow, hate rain on snow.  Phooey on snirt.<br/>
