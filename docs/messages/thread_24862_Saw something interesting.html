I don't cache in the north.<br/>
<br/>
I DO box in the north.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you were asking or are you suddenly determined to make this a<br/>
geocache list?<br/>
<br/>
Do geocachers have discussion lists of their own or are they now stealing<br/>
letterbox lists as well as letterbox hiding places?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Definitely. Around here, many of our letterboxes are hung in trees. Evergreens are great for winter-friendly boxing/caching - the leaves don't drop. <br/>
<br/>
Some of my urban hides are winter-friendly - their hidden in protective areas above the ground, usually using magnets. <br/>
<br/>
A couple of times I've been quite fortunate to find a hole or a deep crook in a tree about waist height, making the hide winter-friendly. Although some crooks and holes collect water and freeze up making the box inaccessible during the winter even though it's above the snow line. Hanging is better since the box won't get encased in ice. <br/>
