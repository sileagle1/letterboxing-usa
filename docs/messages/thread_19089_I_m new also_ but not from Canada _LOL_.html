I recently found out about letterboxing through another <br/>

We haven't actually searched for any boxes yet, but hope to soon.<br/>
  I had some questions about where folks buy their containers? Is <br/>
this the proper place to ask this type of question? <br/>
<br/>
I've seen mention of something called "hitchhikers".  Could someone <br/>
explain to me how they work?  What do people usually put into their <br/>
letterboxes?  I was thinking that it would be nice to add  something <br/>
along the lines of a small trinket such as a charm for a bracelet, or <br/>
a package of beads that one could make jewelry out of.  I think my <br/>
friend mentioned something about putting a rubber stamp into the box. <br/>
What a neat idea - I think Michael's sells some really good stamps. <br/>
I've noticed them when picking up some of my other craft supplies. <br/>
Perhaps we could contact Michaels and see if they might want to use <br/>
Letterboxing as a way to promote their store.  Oh, just think of all <br/>
the possibilities. <br/>
<br/>
How did you all get your "trail names" are they given to you by <br/>
others, or can we just make one up that fits us? <br/>
Some of them are just so very cute! <br/>
<br/>
I am so enthusiastic to get started but not quite sure where to begin <br/>
(LOL). Any help from the group would be appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks :) <br/>

seen your name on some HS boards?  You can answer off list if you like.<br/>
<br/>
My motivation was similar to yours.  We have gone out 4 times now and  found<br/>
boxes on all 4 occasions.  All 4 were places we have never visited before -<br/>
and I thought we got around.  *wink*    I will let older and wiser voices<br/>
answer most of your questions, but I will tell you how we came up with our<br/>
name.  We sat around the table and offered suggestions.  We came up with 9<br/>
possibilities.  Then we let everyone vote for their top 3 choices.  This<br/>
narrowed it down to 3.  One of the choices was on everyone's list, so we<br/>
went with that - God'screationchasers.  A little long, but it works for us!<br/>
