                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went and checked on the box last night and it has fallen  victim of <br/>
foul play . The container was there , but stamp and log are gone .<br/>
I guess this will teach me to place a box where the ease of finding <br/>
is part of the joke . Either that or I've got to stop putting so much <br/>
into my carvings . Lori thinks I may need to see a therapist . I'm <br/>
going to re - carve and replace , then just hope for the best . <br/>
Thanks to anybody that visited the box , it is so great to read what <br/>
people have to say . <br/>
<br/>
Thanks All !!<br/>
