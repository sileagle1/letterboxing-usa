if you feel like hunting my boxes next year, you might want to print<br/>
out the clues this year.<br/>
<br/>
Looks like we've got at least 35 states, and close to 300 clues <br/>
accessable on-line, at least 1 person whose found 100 and one<br/>
whos planted 100 (almost?), and at least 1 region where letterboxing<br/>
has really taken root.  Not bad.<br/>
<br/>
Well, have a happy current year and new year, and happy hunting :-)<br/>

I am not worried about y2k much at all, at least as far as our <br/>
northeast postings go. I feel fairly confident in my local provider, <br/>
and even if it should experience failures, I have all the files <br/>
here on my own computer.<br/>

I wsih a very happy new year to all.<br/>

<br/>
Its nothing to worry about.  I haven't really thought about y2k much,<br/>
but I do know worse case is that my stuff can be put on my ISP's server.<br/>
There might be a considerable delay in me doing this, though, hence the<br/>
warning.  Most of the important stuff is on aol servers.  If these people <br/>
don't make it, it don't really matter, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I back up Mitch's site once a week automatically (this archive will<br/>
not be affected by y2k).  This of course does not get all the clues that <br/>
are elsewhere, but backing up every letterboxing clue on the web is beyond<br/>
the scope of (what I at least) want to be involved with (although because I<br/>
usually _print_ them when they are announced, I have a good collection of<br/>
them anyway).<br/>

	Well, I certainly agree - letterboxing seems to have happily taken root<br/>
on out continent.  So we are about 15 states shy by 12/31, I'll bet that<br/>
we somehow get them filled out DURING 200. And at least 300 boxes! Also,<br/>
something to be proud of.<br/>
<br/>
One of the nicest things that I am looking forward to is the end of<br/>
"Y2K" hype, in all its formats. Hopefully, its just another day. BUT&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

prohibit me placing a box at <sad>.. to watch London's big firework<br/>
spectacle...(The Queen loves fireworks ..so she has decided to make the<br/>
Thames "A River of Fire" ) And as all public transport is free...for 50<br/>
