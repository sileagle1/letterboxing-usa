&gt; You know this is a very tricky subject with lots of people having <br/>
&gt; some strong points of view. I myself don't care much for stamping <br/>
&gt; into and from Hitchhikers that show up at gatherings. This is just my <br/>
&gt; take on it, I'd rather come across the very same hitchhiker I passed <br/>
&gt; up at a gathering, in the field. Again this is just me and you should <br/>
&gt; count things the way you want. It is your count and there is no <br/>
&gt; competition. Some folk are into the numbers and some just can't pass <br/>
&gt; up of the great images some hitchhikers contain. I know I'm not being <br/>
&gt; of great help here but there really is no correct way. Just have fun <br/>

 Do you realize that is the stamp image as well as the clue?<br/>

         We figured that was the case.  He even has a theory but <br/>
hasn't found the right links to find out for sure.  <br/>

 We will be up again and will check out those covered bridges for <br/>
sure. <br/>

  Thanks, Brian.  Your answer helps a lot.  By the way, your Zen <br/>
  mystery has my husband doing some serious research.  We've never <br/>
  studied anything about Zen so this ought to be interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
  I appreciate your help.  Good luck getting rid of the kids.  <br/>
  Thunderstorms usually clear ours for a while but then they infest <br/>
  the house.  Hope we run into you on the trails some day.  <br/>

  ps- My husband (Son of a Sailor) said to scold you for not doing any <br/>
  of the Covered Bridge Series while in NH.  <br/>

  &gt; &gt; I have a question on counting finds and Hitchhikers.  I think <br/>
  the <br/>
  &gt; HH count as finds, is that correct?  Also, I remember reading <br/>
  about <br/>
  &gt; someone talking about the lack of HH on the trails.  It was <br/>
  suggested <br/>
  &gt; that people are saving them and bringing them to gatherings.  Does <br/>
  &gt; that mean if you go to a gathering where there are 10, 20 or even <br/>
  &gt; more HH that you can include them in your find count?  This <br/>
  doesn't <br/>
  &gt; sound right to me but maybe I am not understanding what is going <br/>
  on.  <br/>
  &gt; I'd love it if someone would straighten me out on this.<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; You know this is a very tricky subject with lots of people having <br/>
  &gt; some strong points of view. I myself don't care much for stamping <br/>
  &gt; into and from Hitchhikers that show up at gatherings. This is just <br/>
  my <br/>
  &gt; take on it, I'd rather come across the very same hitchhiker I <br/>
  passed <br/>
  &gt; up at a gathering, in the field. Again this is just me and you <br/>
  should <br/>
  &gt; count things the way you want. It is your count and there is no <br/>
  &gt; competition. Some folk are into the numbers and some just can't <br/>
  pass <br/>
  &gt; up of the great images some hitchhikers contain. I know I'm not <br/>
  being <br/>
  &gt; of great help here but there really is no correct way. Just have <br/>
  fun <br/>
  &gt; and do it your way.<br/>
