I really hate to point this out, but if you are going to put up a <br/>
site such as this, then you OWN the responsibility of keeping it <br/>
updated.  If you have conflicts, we all understand that, but please <br/>
delegate the responsibility to someone else who has time.  This is <br/>
not a responsible way to run a board.  <br/>

Going out looking for boxes that are not there, or have been removed, <br/>
or the clues are wrong, IS NOT FUN.<br/>

I understand your concern with the western boxes. The webmaster who<br/>
regularly maintains these states has been out of touch for a while. The rest<br/>
of us are going to try to catch up with the back log. Give us a week and we<br/>
hope to have things right.<br/>

Thanks for your message.  Most of us know who the <br/>
western editor is, and we aren't really on his case, <br/>
but we do need regular updates to keep things flowing <br/>
smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>
