Letterboxing Fest in Tumwater, WA proved to be a quite <br/>
successful 'last-minute' event.  Although we were greeted with <br/>
liquid sunshine, the sun soon appeared and we stamped away with <br/>
glee!  Fudrick's event stamp was great as were the numerous <br/>
hitchhiker letterboxes we glimpsed before they traveled on their <br/>
merry ways to the four corners of the Earth.  Whenever Ryan C. <br/>
plants a box in a different galaxy, I'm sure these hitchhikers will <br/>
eventually reach those venues, too!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all participants for a great time.  Despite the atypical <br/>
summer (more like the East Coast's current) 'gloomy' weather at the <br/>
onset of the event, several dozen letterboxers attended and the food <br/>
was incredible!  It was so great to meet so many new &amp; WAY <br/>
ENTHUSIASTIC letterboxers!!!  Wow!  Their enthusiasm is definitely <br/>
contagious!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you all (and the others regional letterboxers who <br/>
weren't able to attend) at future events.  Plan on a big <br/>
letterboxing frenzy event sometime this Fall!!!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the letterboxing trails...<br/>
