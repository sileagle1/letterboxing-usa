ago.  Please replace DuPont, WA Series #2 (Fort Nisqually LB) clues <br/>
with these:<br/>
<br/>
DuPont Letterbox #2: Fort Nisqually circa 1833<br/>
Originally Placed:  23 July 2002,  Replanted a new stamp in a new <br/>
location:  3 Oct 2002<br/>
<br/>
Back to `Grand Junction', another decision you must make,<br/>
Is it Haskell? Edmond? Davis? Bell? or the Village trail dare I take?<br/>
I think Ed is your friend, if that is your desire,<br/>
For toward Sequalitchew Creek is the letterbox you will acquire.<br/>
<br/>
3/10ths of a mile, is how far you must proceed,<br/>
When again a decision to make you will need.<br/>
Not Center or straight but West you will veer,<br/>
You see, toward Sequalitchew Creek is where Fort Nisqually once did <br/>
appear.<br/>
<br/>
4/10ths of a mile, not very far toward the West,<br/>
Is the site of Historic Fort Nisqually of which is your quest.<br/>
<br/>
Read the sign, cross the bridge, with a curious mind you must tread,<br/>
Look at the knoll in the distance with all the fruit trees up ahead.<br/>
<br/>
The area `in fenced' was once a bustling fort,<br/>
Full of beads, blankets, furs, baskets; more things of this sort,<br/>
All once traded here, by the Company of Hudson Bay,<br/>
The Historic Fort known first in 1833 as Nisqually. <br/>
<br/>
First at this `exact' site in 1843, is when it was here,<br/>
But in the early 1930s they moved it 17 miles north, I do fear.<br/>
DuPont is the place the Fort in 1843 you could see,<br/>
Now Point Defiance Park in Tacoma gets the glory.<br/>
<br/>
Now, where, is that `box' that I really do seek?<br/>
It must have been, it had to have been, really close to the creek.<br/>
Return to the bridge, with caution and care,<br/>
Look carefully around, that no other people (or animals) you might <br/>
scare,<br/>
Don't peek under the bridge nor to the east you will be,<br/>
And don't look for the rocks, in, under, over, beneath it might be.<br/>
<br/>
But, thanks to the truants, who had their little fun,<br/>
The box has been rehidden with a new stamp, closer to the Fort's <br/>
location.<br/>
Head back across the bridge, and take the first left path you see.<br/>
Look to your right, for amidst the roots behind the rose tree by the <br/>
fence is where it'll be. (actually it's a jumble of three different <br/>
living and dead trees/weeds)<br/>
<br/>
Again do your deed, and return it with care,<br/>
For other letterboxers in the future will hope it is there!<br/>
<br/>
To return to the start, go back to the trail,<br/>
On the main path, retrace earlier steps, you won't fail.<br/>
Edmond Marsh Intersection is the first you should see,<br/>
Grand Junction the second, if the right way you will be,<br/>
Follow the signs to the Village almost 4/10ths of a mile,<br/>
Return to your car and your face will soon smile!<br/>
<br/>
Butif you seek Letterbox #3,<br/>
Follow the clues to Wilkes Observatory<br/>
