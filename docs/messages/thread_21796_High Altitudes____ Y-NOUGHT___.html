Colorado in March!  We really wanted to do the boxes on Animas Overlook<br/>
but the park was closed (any idea on when It'll be open?).  Also we<br/>
LOVED campus In the sky!  There I was with my friend and our 4 kids.  2<br/>
of which had to be carried cuz they're so young.  We'd have loved to<br/>
have the amount of oxygen that is provided at the 4000 ft level!  That<br/>
box took us clear across the campus, dragging our kids, all of us<br/>
wishing we had an oxygen tank!  Then just when we thought we were done,<br/>
(1 parent was gonna go get the car while the other parent waited with<br/>
the kids) there was a reason (can you say bonus box!) for us to walk all<br/>
the way back to our starting point.and then some!  Boy, we were<br/>
exhausted!  But it was a blast!  Can't wait to do the animas overlook.or<br/>
Three Keys, my only problem is figuring out the "code"  That one<br/>
confused the heck out of me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks y-nought for a great vacation letterbox hunt, can't wait to get<br/>
there next year and visit some other ones.<br/>

Four Thousand Feet!<br/>
I don't think I have any letterboxes that low. Some of the hikes <br/>
around here START at 10,000 feet. My highest letterbox is at 13,800 <br/>
feet above sea level and it's maybe the third highest in the state. <br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to place one at the 4000 foot elevation where I live I <br/>
would need to dig a hole a half mile deep!<br/>
<br/>
y-nought,  with the scrubby trees in Colorado.<br/>

&gt; Hi to all in LB land,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; arrived at what should get the "worst letterbox spot" award. Next <br/>
to a<br/>
&gt; "scrubby tree" (you'd be scrubby to if you grew at over 4000 ft <br/>
above sea<br/>
&gt; level) was the flat rock that covered the letterbox.  What a <br/>
terrible<br/>
&gt; place for a letterbox!   Who knows what  anyone would do up there <br/>
where the air is so<br/>
&gt; thin and clean?  <br/>

Thank you. You are very kind. I'm going to try to make it up to Animas <br/>
Overlook this weekend. This was a big snow year for us and the road has <br/>
been closed for longer than usual.<br/>
<br/>
And I hope to have a few new boxes for you when you come back.<br/>
