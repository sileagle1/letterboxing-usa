                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's official!  The beta testing is over and it's working perfectly... <br/>
What's working perfectly you ask?<br/>
Well since you've asked, I'll gladly share with you! (Grin!)<br/>
<br/>
The mapping functions are operational that the NLC website (URL below).  This is a function that allows you, the box <br/>
placer/maintainer to give people driving directions to the starting location of your clues, with no effort on your <br/>
part!  No, seriously. No effort on your part.  Just include the address, city and state of the starting point of your <br/>
letterbox when adding it to the LCAS Database, check 'Yes' for "Include Mapquest Map' and viola!  A link will be <br/>
automagically (Don't ask me how, I think it's got something to do with elves and all working behind the scenes but <br/>
don't quote me on that one) created and placed in the database so that when someone displays your clues, the link will <br/>
be displayed and, when they click on that link, they will be taken to a map that shows the starting location of your <br/>
clues and given the opportunity to enter their starting address and get door to door, as it were, driving directions.<br/>
<br/>
No more taking up the first 3 pages of your clues with driving directions from everywhere on the face of the earth.  <br/>
Just 3 entries and the driving directions from ANYWHERE are available for your letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Please take note of a few things. This is not meant to destroy anything, just to give a few value added services.  If <br/>
you don't want to use this feature, you don't have to. Nothing is forced on you, you are in complete control of how <br/>
your letterbox is presented.  Of course, if you are entering a Mystery Box, then you'd prolly not want to use this <br/>
function, but who knows?  To each their own.  This is not an offshoot of geocaching or anything, we're not giving the <br/>
exact location of the letterbox here, just helping people find the starting point to your letterbox.  Couple this with <br/>
the Letterbox Rating System and you've got a winning combo! (In my not so humble opinion! (grin!!))<br/>
<br/>
Give it a shot, I think you'll like it.<br/>
