the heck they couldn't just go to the Yahoo groups and unsubscribe if the<br/>
email option didn't work. I mean how hard could it be?<br/>
<br/>
WELL! Let me tell you that I have unsubscribed via email *and* on the site<br/>
*many times*, and deleted all my email addresses. I even deleted my alias.<br/>
But to no avail.  I kept getting double doses of LBNA mail in two accounts.<br/>
All I really wanted to do was stop them from coming into my Yahoo mailbox<br/>
because I get all that cruddy spam (You know the kind! Add six inches or two<br/>
sizes to anything you've got...) and I don't want to receive that stuff on<br/>
my work computer during break.  But nooooooooooo... Yahoo is determined to<br/>
keep sending all the LbNA messages to my Yahoo mail, even though the site<br/>
says I belong to not a single group now.<br/>
<br/>
I want to get all the individual LbNA emails, I just don't want all the<br/>
Yahoo spam.  And I like reading in OE5, not on the site.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here knows how to subscribe using a different email address than<br/>
the Yahoo ID one and avoid double delivery, please clue me in.  This has<br/>
been a real Twilight Zone experience. ;-)<br/>
