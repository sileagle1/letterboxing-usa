Claquato Church letterbox was waterlogged and needing help. Took 3 <br/>
Nailboys along and replaced the log book. <br/>
<br/>
Also placed a new box very close by at the Claquato Cemetery. This <br/>
is a doublesided stamp that measures about 4" x 2 1/2" so make sure <br/>
to take a large enough log book to capture the images. <br/>
<br/>
The Pioneer Fir Tree letterbox commemorates the incredible Pioneer <br/>
Fir Tree within the cemetery. This land was originally settled in <br/>
the mid 1840's and the original pioneers built a temporary shelter <br/>
under the limbs of this enormous fir tree while they cleared the <br/>
land and built a permanent shelter. It is truly an amazing tree <br/>
with an amazing story behind it. When I first saw this tree I knew <br/>
it had to be the subject of a stamp and letterbox. The clues will <br/>
be posted on the LBNA site tonight. <br/>
<br/>
After we placed this box we checked on the Adna Trestle box located <br/>
just a few miles away. No visitors yet. While we were at it, we <br/>
placed a bonus box there too. Hope that this will get some people <br/>
interested. <br/>
<br/>
Later we drove further out Hwy 6 and took in a lovely Rainbow near a <br/>
falls. Seems only a handful of folks have been up that way. <br/>
Directly across the highway is a trailhead onto a public park area <br/>
administered by a state agency that is just begging for some boxes. <br/>
I think I saw a great place for a raven nest(house) close by too. <br/>
Hope more folks get up that way soon. It is really nice there now <br/>
with all the rain dripping off the trees.<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail,<br/>
