Rated: Easy (10 minutes or less)<br/>
Location: Southeast Park  Mansfield Center, Connecticut<br/>
Planted By: Pink Trotters (Leader of the Pack is my Mom)<br/>
<br/>
The Happy birthday box is a special box to celebrate Leader of the <br/>
Pack's birthday (10/7/02).  <br/>
<br/>
Take Route 89 to Warrenville Road. After the southeast school you <br/>
will see group of sports fields. This is Southeast Park; take the <br/>
dirt driveway to the back of the park. There is a trail opening <br/>
marked with a rock. Enter the trail and follow it to the left.  You <br/>
will eventually be walking in an area with pines on both sides of the <br/>
trail. Toward the end of the pine section there is a very narrow path <br/>
down the hill toward the lake, follow that. You will see a tree with <br/>
three trunks, behind it is another tree with two trunks one is alive <br/>
and tall, the other is dead and short.  The Happy Birthday box is <br/>
behind that tree under some sticks and leaves.<br/>
<br/>
As always be discrete, close the lid tight and rehide the box WELL.  <br/>
