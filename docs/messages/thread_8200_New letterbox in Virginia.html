                    <div class="plaintext-content">Riverbend Park, in Fairfax County, Virginia. Nearest town is Great <br/>
Falls. This is #4 in the Riverbend Park series.<br/>
Follow the previous instructions to Riverbend Park and to the <br/>
Nature Center. Keep in mind that the building is closed except <br/>
for special events; there is a porta-john in the parking lot, but <br/>
clean restrooms are available back at the Visitors Center.<br/>
Difficulty: It is about a 20-25 minute walk each way and the return <br/>
trip is partly uphill. It is an easier and much flatter walk from the <br/>
Visitors Center, but this route takes you through a different part of <br/>
the park. You will need a compass, and you will need to <br/>
differentiate between a step and a pace. From the parking lot <br/>
walk to the Nature Center and follow the signs to the Paw-Paw <br/>
Trail. Take the trail downhill, across the bridge and up to the <br/>
intersection with a service road. Turn right on the trail/road and <br/>
walk down past the pond, bearing right here, and on down to the <br/>
intersection with the River Trail. Head upriver on this trail for <br/>
10-12 minutes till you come to a new earthen bridge over a <br/>
creek. Cross the creek and walk about 80 paces (1 1/2 minutes) <br/>
till you come to a small path bearing about 8 degrees, almost <br/>
due south. Follow this path for about 31 paces until it is just <br/>
about to bear left near the foot of a hill. On a bearing of 143 <br/>
degrees take 32 steps, past a double-trunked sycamore with a <br/>
white "F.C. Boundary" sign on it, to another large sycamore. <br/>
WHO COOKS FOR YOU? letterbox is at the base of this second <br/>
tree, on the south side, under leaves, sticks and sycamore bark.<br/>
