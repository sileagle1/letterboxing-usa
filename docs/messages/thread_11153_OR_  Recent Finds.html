<br/>
We've been out and about letterboxing here and there.  John got Forest<br/>
Frog last week, but, alas, I had to work, so he soloed on that hike.<br/>
<br/>
Together, however, we have managed since Saturday to get Sol Stamper's<br/>
Nature Books #1 &amp; #2 and Funhog's Oaks Bottom Letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Oaks Bottom was a bit tricky, but luckily we trudged on and found where<br/>
we were really supposed to be!  What a great letterbox.  As usual a<br/>
great stamp and logbook left by Karen!  <br/>
Sol Stamper's Nature Box #1 is in an interesting spot.  I do worry about<br/>
its location, as the "plastic wall" is probably only temporary and is<br/>
barely hidden by leaves (we recovered it well, though), plus there is<br/>
tons of traffic in that area.  I do love the stamp!  Not only that, but<br/>
this box is mere steps from my Bike Route letterbox, so I was able to<br/>
check on that one, too.  It has had two visitors since it was placed.<br/>
Had I known how easy it is to get to from Oaks Bottom I would have<br/>
included instructions from there, as well.  Maybe I still can, Webmaster<br/>
willing.  Then again, if people can figure it out themselves from Oaks<br/>
Bottom, then it will be more of a challenge, I suppose.  They can just<br/>
get to the general area by reading Nature Book #1's clues, and then<br/>
figure it out from there.    Either way, it's kind of a cute stamp if I<br/>
do say so myself.  Definitely fits the area where it's placed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Heather and Karen for placing wonderful letterboxes for us to<br/>
seek out this past week.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
