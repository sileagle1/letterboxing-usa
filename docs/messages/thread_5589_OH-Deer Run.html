taking about 69 steps to the log at the top of the trail head.  Guess What, You<br/>
are going down the hill. As you look around, it looks like a war zone on the tree's<br/>
as you will see downed tree's all over the place. 41 steps down the path, The path<br/>
will make a sharp 90' turn to the right. STOP here. Take a reading of 280' and start<br/>

up the hill.  at the top of the hill you will see a BLUE trail marker on a tree. From this<br/>
marker take a reading of 330'.  Take about 19 steps in that direction. You should<br/>
a few stumps on the ground. The Box you are looking for is in the short stump.<br/>
