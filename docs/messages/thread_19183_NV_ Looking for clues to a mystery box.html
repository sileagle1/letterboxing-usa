                    <div class="plaintext-content">There was a Nevada mystery box that I had figured out the approximate location to that isn't listed on the new site.  I went to the letterboxing.org site and the link to the old site is gone.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone, by some off chance, had the clues for this box in south-eastern NV.  I believe one of the clues was about a highway number whose digits added up to 16.  There was also a mention of the final location being used in movies.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
