    OK ok, i take the part about the suv back.  And Thom's truck<br/>
(except it being new) gets him a few points back for being dirty and<br/>
i'll add another few if there's a gun rack and empty beer cans rolling<br/>
around in back.  Plus the phone in the kitchen helps some too, if its<br/>
one of those dial types.  So i'm guessing Thom's ok (even if he don't<br/>
spell his name right).<br/>
   Cara's ok even with the Honda and Veggies..... she's going to put in<br/>
a bunch of boxes within reach and thats just ok by me.<br/>
    You spose its ok if i place a box or two amongst the rusted out car<br/>
bodies in my front yard?  Or maybe hide one in the fridge on my porch? <br/>
<br/>
     Oh i can see i've hooked up with the right crowd right off.    You<br/>
guys are great!   <br/>
     Welp i best sign off if  i'm to get that ole truck off the blocks<br/>
and smoke my way out a few logging roads and maybe hide one in a<br/>
clear-cut for you guys.        HA!!  jim<br/>
