i was just wondering......<br/>

i see where people have planted letterboxes whilest on a trip somewheres and then posted the clues to it.....<br/>
<br/>
what about maintaining these boxes??...because who replaces/maintains/fixes these boxes???..what if they go missing and cant be found do to the actual disapperance of the box or that maybe the box is still there and is just missed by the "hunter"....who can go to confirm it is actually gone or just missed????.....<br/>
<br/>
i just wondered since if some of these boxes are off the beaten path and takes a while to go to, to locate only to have them actually gone or just missed..<br/>
<br/>
wheres as if the box is maintained the "hider" can go check on it to confirm if its just missed or actually disappeared and be able to announce it is out of commission forever or temporarily until it can be replaced....<br/>
<br/>
example: drive to the desert....take road BLAH BLAH.....follow 4 miles....turn left....take the dirt path 1 mile...look for such and such landmark...climb the rocks up to crevice...find box....all in 100 plus degree weather.....only to find this missing..<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found two boxes missing while visiting Sarasota, FL.  Both places <br/>
were well worth visiting box, or not box, and I was glad I went.  <br/>
<br/>
I wrote one of the boxers, who was from Ohio, and offered to replace <br/>
it and did.  I also placed one box of my own.<br/>
<br/>
Now there are more letterboxers in the Tampa area after a recent <br/>
newspaper article so maybe others down there will look after them.<br/>
<br/>
I often see people offering to check on local boxes placed by out of <br/>
towners.  (Which reminds me I am supposed to check on one here but <br/>
have not been able to get to it.)<br/>
