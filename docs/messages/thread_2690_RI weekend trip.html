                    <html><body><div> </div> <blockquote> <div> </div> <div>So Duke (my dog) and I spent the weekend hunting down some RI boxes.  We had a great time, and since the weather was less than perfect Sunday, we got to pick up some boxes along the shore as well.  Just thought I'd mention a couple of things.  One, for the Kurdziels (sorry if I spelled it wrong :( ), the Minimalist Series was the most fun I've had searching for boxes.  I've never been so anxious to see if I guessed the next one right.  They were all hilarious.  If anyone had been entering the park when I was leaving, they probably would have thought twice when they saw me leaving, grinning ear to ear.  Also, the box in South Kingstown at the treaty rock, I think might be missing.  I was pretty sure I had the right place (there really weren't too many rocks to choose from).  </div> <div>And the box in Wilcox Park in Westerly might be gone as well.  I know I had the right place, but alas, no box.  </div> <div>And one general question.  On my way to Portsmouth from Jamestown, I saw a sign for the Green Animals Topiary Gardens.  Now, there are plenty of reasons why I myself didn't go, besides for Stephen King's frightful descriptions of topiary animals.  I mean, there were thunderstorms, and it was getting dark, and Duke was already whining from the thunder, the last thing HE needed to see was big vicious animals chasing him.  Alright, I'll admit, I was a little bit nervous about going, on the off chance that there were three lions and a dog at the gates or something.  Well, to my question.  Has anyone ever been there? And does it have three lions and a dog? :)  Or are there only small, friendly looking topiary animals?  I think that would be a great place for a box, I mean, if you got an army of people to protect you when you turn your back.</div> <div>Oh, and one more, the old bridge box, is that decommissioned? Cause you really can't get on the bridge anymore, they put up a 10 foot high fence on both sides.. Just wondering...</div> <div>So that's about it, I found lots of boxes, planted by lots of different people, and I had a lot of fun, so thanks!</div> <div> </div> <div>Kimberly</div> <div>MartianMaggot &amp; K9</div> <div>from NJ<br/><br/></div></blockquote></body></html>
