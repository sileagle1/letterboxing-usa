  Two of us were at Hawkin's Pond, Windsor, NY trying to locate the<br/>
"Serpent's Box".  We did not have any trouble identifying the clues, and<br/>
landmarks described.  However, we were unable to find the box.<br/>
Individually we located two oak trees approximately 10 feet apart.  I<br/>
feel we were correct in our location, but am concerned about  the box<br/>
still being there.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
christine<br/>
