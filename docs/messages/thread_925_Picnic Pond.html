Picnic Pond<br/>
<br/>
Hopeville Pond State Park in Griswold, CT is a great place for a swim, a <br/>
paddle, and a picnic. The Nehantic Trail cuts through the park, and there is <br/>
a nature trail as well, but this letterbox is more for an enjoyable day by <br/>
the water and the hiking is minimal. Directions: From I-395 just north of <br/>
Norwich, CT, take exit 85 and head east on Rte. 138. Turn left (north) at the <br/>
Hopeville Pond sign, and then left again when directed and enter the park on <br/>
your left after the ball fields (there is a seasonal fee). Drive in and fork <br/>
right away from the campground to park near the concession stand in the beach <br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Carry your cooler from the beach along the wide trail south, with the pond on <br/>
your right. After a couple of hundred yards, turn right out to an open picnic <br/>
point on the water. Out at the end turn right again into a new area with rock <br/>
underfoot to a huge white pine tree. Stepping behind the pine, turn right <br/>
again and bushwack about 25 feet on a heading of 070 degrees to find the <br/>
Picnic Pond Letterbox on the ground behind a tree.<br/>
