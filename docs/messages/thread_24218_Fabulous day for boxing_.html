Intricate carvings to hunt via the epic poem clues!  Thanks so much, B <br/>
Hunters!<br/>

A bonus - when I got on line tonight to log these finds and write a <br/>
thank you note, I had a note in my AQ mailbox - seems a box of mine <br/>
which had been reported missing - AND I verified it's missing status <br/>
Thursday - - - was found on Friday!  Whaaa...?  How could this happen?  <br/>
I'm pretty darn sure I was in the correct spot when I checked on it - <br/>
there aren't a lot of hollow pines in this particular location.  Not <br/>
that I'm complaining, mind you...I was sad to see this one go, as it <br/>
was a favorite carve, and getting it back, unexpectedly, is a real <br/>
treat.  But still.  Whaaa...? *scratches cranium*  Lucy!  You got <br/>
some 'splainin' to do!<br/>

Cool!  I'd bet someone else had it "checked out" when you went to see <br/>
if it was there.  LOL<br/>
