                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to Sadie and Russ for letting us know that the Guida Farms <br/>
Latterbox #2 was vandalized. We will try to get another stamp done <br/>
shortly and put back out there...we will change the hiding spot and <br/>
give new clues. Thank you for your patience Letterboxers and thanks <br/>
to Sadie and Russ...by the way...we were at their boxes today and ALL <br/>
were in terrific shape...LOVED the MYSTERY Stamp as well as the <br/>
Hammonasset Men- very K-E-W-E-L...what a grand day for Letterboxing.<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
