<br/>
To be a letterbox the container must hold a stamp and a log. None, one or <br/>
both can be hand made.<br/>
<br/>
We've done each of these depending on the box.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are not good carvers!!!<br/>
<br/>
To some it is a big deal to have a carved stamp, to others it is not.<br/>
<br/>
However it is done - it is still a letterbox.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To me, it's certainly not necessary, but it's incredibly enjoyable to see a <br/>
situation where it all comes together in one spiffs and total package.<br/>
<br/>
1.  The placer picked a spot whose beauty or interest either stands on it's <br/>
own merits or the area holds a special spot in the placer's heart for some <br/>
reason;<br/>
<br/>
2.  As bad an artist as they may be, the placer took the time and <br/>
determination to make the stamp.  I don't really see a difference, however, between an <br/>
artist who makes their own drawing but has the stamp made commercially from that <br/>
drawing, and someone who actually does their own carving, but I don't know <br/>
what the feeling is in general amongst Americans;<br/>
<br/>
3.  The stamp includes the placename or event somewhere on it (this doesn't <br/>
seem to be important to Americans from what we've seen so far so I've only done <br/>
it for a very few of my stamps but I'm going to do it from now on because I <br/>
still prefer it myself);<br/>
<br/>
4.  The stamp image somehow relates to it's placement;<br/>
<br/>
5.  There's something either mentally challenging, physically challenging, or <br/>
adrenalin-rushing about finding the box.  Andrenalin-rushing, for example, <br/>
being that great feeling that comes from devising how to snag a box and return a <br/>
box in a crowded urban environment, saying "let's do it!", and then actually <br/>
pulling it off.   (I prefer the challenge to be related to the box placement <br/>
-- I don't care for having to solve riddles or whatnot that aren't related to <br/>
where the box is placed or aren't related to the subject of the box -- but <br/>
that's purely personal preference.)    <br/>
<br/>
6.  And one item that Keith would definitely add -- If people are finding <br/>
boxes, those same people should also be placing at least one or two boxes of <br/>
their own.  Keith sees it as a total package activity -- as do I albeit a little <br/>
less so, but not that much less so. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Now, do I expect boxes to meet all my goals?  Of course not.  Our own boxes <br/>
don't.  :-) <br/>
<br/>
Keith &amp; I don't live to letterbox, we do letterboxing as we're doing other <br/>
things along with it, whether it's photography, drawing, birding, things related <br/>
to botany, camping, getting an education about some interesting subject, <br/>
picnicking or doing something romantic, etc.  So a lot of times Number 5 up there <br/>
never really has a place in our plans anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
But it's still incredible when it can all come together.  I guess I see <br/>
letterboxing as being for hunters and for artists and for storytellers (hunting <br/>
artistic storytellers? artistic storytelling hunters? :-) ).  And when one gets <br/>
right down to the inner soul of a person, everyone is a hunter and everyone is <br/>
an artist and everyone is a storyteller.  Everyone.  No matter how much <br/>
society, or the education system, etc. has tried to convince us otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
And now I'm off to Montana for a couple of days, and lb.org doesn't seem to <br/>
have any boxes listed for eastern Montana...........<wail>...<wail>...<wail>...<br/>

Many in this world would love to have that worry.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you choose to celebrate (or not) at this time of year, I wish for you health and happiness.<br/>

Nope.  I don't know any boxers who might live in eastern Montana to <br/>
contact them.<br/>
<br/>
We believe in keeping track of our boxes from a maintenance <br/>
standpoint.  If someone should contact us that one of our boxes is <br/>
possibly missing, or contact us to say that one of our boxes needs <br/>
any sort of first aid, we want to have the boxes placed close enough <br/>
to be able to get out to it within a day or two.  Just a personal <br/>
preference of ours -- not because our boxes are our "babies" or any <br/>
such slush, but just because we'd prefer that if people come from any <br/>
sort of distance to find boxes, there really is a box there in good <br/>
condition to find.<br/>
<br/>
If it were a situation like Mr. B.F. Gates, where the find was a few <br/>
billion dollars of Egyptian treasure, where there's generally a <br/>
winner-take-all mentality to the hunt, I'd say hey, if it's there <br/>
when ya get there, it's there.  If someone got there before you, <br/>
tough.  :-) But letterboxes are supposed to stay put.   <br/>
<br/>
When we move, we either pull up our boxes or we find a local boxer <br/>
willing to adopt them.  And altho we know folks in Montana, we don't <br/>
know anyone who boxes who might want to adopt a few boxes.  There's <br/>
beautiful territory for hiding boxes however in that neck of the <br/>
woods. <br/>

I have planted many boxes far from home. I feel that<br/>
seeding an area with few boxes is an important way <br/>
of encouraging future letterboxers. I always try to <br/>
make a special efforts with these long distance plants <br/>
to hide them in such a way that they are very unlikely <br/>
to go missing. I always try to keep the information<br/>
current on my clue page, based on good contact <br/>
placer reports. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, I have found that I have made many new <br/>
friends via my out of state boxes. Folks who live in <br/>
states with slim pickins are very pleased to have a <br/>
visitor leave a box behind for them to find. I think it's<br/>
safe to say that my annual visits to Nebraska <br/>
are eagerly awaited by Scott Redd, an Omaha boxer.<br/>
There are so few letterboxes in his area that I feel <br/>
duty bound to leave a box for him to find!<br/>
<br/>
When I get a report that one has disappeard, <br/>
is missing a stamp or a book needs replacing, I will <br/>
ask if the person writing me is local to that box. <br/>
Many times, I have had kind offers to do the required <br/>
first aid for me. I send the replacement parts and a <br/>
good samaritan does the rest. Viva Random Acts of <br/>
Letterboxing Kindness! Funhog<br/>

I second Funhog's and Don's comments regarding placing letterboxes <br/>
far away from home.  Many times we visit areas that have very few or <br/>
no letterboxes whatsoever and like to 'seed' an area when possible <br/>
(or leave treats for those 'lonely' letterboxers in any area lacking <br/>
letterboxes).  As we're the types of folks who explore a region we <br/>
visit even if it doesn't contain any letterboxes, we like to share <br/>
our adventures with future visitors and perhaps introduce a few of <br/>
the locals to this 'cool' hobby.  We recently placed 4 boxes in a <br/>
country we frequent every 5 years or so although we have 'contacts' <br/>
on the ground who may be able to help out with the maintenance, if <br/>
necessary.  If the box goes missing, we just annotate that in the <br/>
clues.  We also try to place the boxes in cool or historic places so <br/>
even if the box happens to go missing, folks get to experience <br/>
something interesting they otherwise would never have visited or <br/>
known about had it not been for letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Ditto for getting to 'virtually' meet so many cool people through <br/>
our long distance 'orphaned' letterboxes out there.  Our experience <br/>
over the past couple of years is that we've developed many great <br/>
friendships with folks from around the world since we've planted <br/>
letterboxes in various regions around the country (&amp; now overseas, <br/>
recently, as well).<br/>
