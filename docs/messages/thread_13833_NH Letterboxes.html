<br/>
My problem is that I can't figure out what counties I'll be in to search the website for letterboxes. Can anyone help me? <br/>
<br/>
I am going to Lincoln to visit some friends on Friday and then will be staying in Campton for the weekend. <br/>
<br/>
I have tried searching the NH website to figure out counties and everything but I'm just confusing myself more. <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any help with this! <br/>

There a many letterboxes near the White Mountain Area  it seems.  Good Luck. <br/>

There are two rest stop boxes on 91 and hopefully there will soon be <br/>
one on the way south just out of White River.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Peppermint Patti, <br/>
Lincoln is in Grafton County near  Waterville Valley. Grafton County extends <br/>
from the Hanover area and the Connecticut River on the west all the way to the <br/>
notches, what used to be the OLD MAN territory, in the north. North of there <br/>
is Coos County.<br/>
Campton is in Carroll County which is south of the Waterville Valley area. <br/>
Carroll County extends east to the Maine border.<br/>
The Lakes region of the state is Belknap County. It is right in the center. <br/>
You can look for "Red Spotted Newt" in the rest area on Rt. 93 south bound on <br/>
your way home. It is in Belknap County.<br/>
The Concord area is in Merrimack county.<br/>
The seacoast is in Rockingham County.<br/>
Peterborough, Rindge, Jaffrey and Keene in the southwest are in Cheshire <br/>
County.<br/>
The central southern part of the state is Hillsborough County, my stomping <br/>
ground.<br/>
Good luck and enjoy your visit with us!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On 9/1, Culex and I ventured over the NH border to hit a few <br/>
letterboxes. Here are some notes on our letterboxing adventures:<br/>
Found Garrison Hill in Dover easily. The view from the tower is <br/>
incredible (despite ugly grafitti), so be sure to climb up and see the <br/>
view before heading off in search of the letterbox. Hope to see some <br/>
more planted in this area.<br/>
Adams Point in Durham was a nice hike in, although those with kids <br/>
will want to watch out as there is a lot of poison ivy along this path <br/>
and there are several steep drop-offs. This box is a geocache also and <br/>
according to the logbook, geocachers have seen fit to "hide it better" <br/>
several times. Hence, it was not in the place it should be, but was <br/>
still in the general area.<br/>
Shorthand in Durham, further along the same trail as Adams Point, was <br/>
nowhere to be found. I've emailed the placer to see if they have any <br/>
recent status updates- anyone else found this one recently? All we <br/>
found was more poison ivy and a ground wasp nest. Yikes! Tread <br/>
carefully in this area.<br/>
Sandy's Box in Greenland was there, but was a bit soggy and needs a <br/>
new stamp pad. A new log book couldn't hurt either if anyone is <br/>
heading there soon you might want to bring those two items along.<br/>
Susie Sells Seashells in Rye was right where it was supposed to be. It <br/>
had some amusing stories in the logbook, so be sure to read them.<br/>
Seacoast #1 in Rye was fine as was Rye Beach. However, Odiorne Point <br/>
seems to be missing (on the website it says there have been multiple <br/>
missing reports). We scoured the area, which appears to have been <br/>
recently trimmed by park staff, and found nothing.<br/>
We also had no luck with Seacoast #2 at the Urban Forestry Center. The <br/>
tree it refers to has had one of its trunks cut off recently. The <br/>
hiding cavity is exposed, there is no letterbox, and the rock it <br/>
mentions as covering the cavity is now at the base of the tree. I've <br/>
gone to Aisling's website to try and notify her, but the contact link <br/>
doesn't seem to be working. Anyone know how I can get in touch with <br/>
her to have her confirm?<br/>
On a brighter note, further down the trail Golden Pegasus was still <br/>
hiding away.<br/>
All in all, not a bad little trip. Once again we were hoping to find a <br/>
hitchhiker, but didn't find any! So sad!<br/>
