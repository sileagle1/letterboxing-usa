                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all :) Yesterday, I discovered a box someone had placed in my area that<br/>
was heavily damaged in the recent rains. There was no contact information in<br/>
the box, nor was there any on the website where I found the clues<br/>
originally. I'm /very/ new to letterboxing, so please excuse my ignorance if<br/>
this isn't the proper place to post a notification when the owner can't be<br/>
located :)<br/>
<br/>
The box is the Thompson Creek Trail Letterbox #1, Claremont, California,<br/>
placed in July of 2002 by Timaroo of Grombolia. The lid cracked and it<br/>
appears someone didn't seal the Ziplocs tightly so the container and bag<br/>
holding the book were both filled with water. The stamp was wet as well but<br/>
not damaged. We dried things off as best we could and tried to ensure the<br/>
crack on the lid was covered well for protection.<br/>

&gt;Hi all :) Yesterday, I discovered a box someone had placed in my area that<br/>
&gt;was heavily damaged in the recent rains. There was no contact information in<br/>
&gt;the box, nor was there any on the website where I found the clues<br/>

<br/>
Yes, this is as good a place as any to post a report. If the owner can't be <br/>
found, then at least other letterboxers will know about the box's condition <br/>
and perhaps the next seeker can come prepared to make the necessary repairs.<br/>
<br/>
You can also search the archives on the Yahoo! groups for this list, and <br/>
see if you can turn up the owner. The search function only searches a block <br/>
of messages at once, so to find messages from last year, you need to click <br/>
the "Next" link several times to continue your search.<br/>
<br/>
In searching my own list archives, I found that that this clue was posted <br/>
last July by "j_arnal_1999+at+yahoo.com" (replace the "+at+" with the @ <br/>
sign). I don't know if this person is still on the list or not, or if this <br/>
email address is valid, but you might also send a report to this address <br/>
and see what you discover.<br/>
