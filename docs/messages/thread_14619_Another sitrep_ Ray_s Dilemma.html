Music Woman had been there.  I went in, got a general idea of the <br/>
area, the clues clicked, and I had box-in-hand within 5 minutes of <br/>
looking! Yay!   Stamping took a while because Madras and I were <br/>
dancing the butterfly dance in joy. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, in the process of attempting other local boxes...i found <br/>
the first and got WAY lost on the second. Had to cross a stream, got <br/>
really muddy, not a fun time at all. Sad to say, but I will not be <br/>
going back for box #2.  <br/>
