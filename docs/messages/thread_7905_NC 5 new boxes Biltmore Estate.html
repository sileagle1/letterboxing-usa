Biltmore Estate.<br/>
<br/>
Nearest town Asheville NC<br/>
Buncombe County<br/>
This is a fee area; see www.Biltmore.com for admission prices and other <br/>
information.<br/>
Leashed dogs okay.<br/>
Clues medium.<br/>
It's hilly; stretch your baby cows!<br/>
<br/>
NO. 1 -THE GARDEN<br/>
Compass needed.<br/>
Park in the Usual Lot (near the House)<br/>
Find and open a B.O.B. cookbook.<br/>
Go to where you see Bill standing.<br/>
Let your feet follow his gaze up to the Nubile.<br/>
Step left of Rover and hold your right arm straight out to your side, <br/>
touching her fingertip with yours.<br/>
Take 35 Small Woman Steps 142 degrees up to the first large Hemlock. Go <br/>
'round back of it.  Take about 138 Small Woman Steps up dirt road and watch <br/>
on Right for Split Oak before cut logs.  Leave the worn road and take 49 <br/>
Small Woman Steps up to High Wire Gate.<br/>
The Twins on your left hide your prize between their fence-side toes.<br/>
Be sure to cover it back up when you're done.<br/>
<br/>
NO. 2 - THE WINDMILL QUILT<br/>
Compass Needed.<br/>
At the SW end of the Big Wet (better to park here than try to hike here), <br/>
six Ents guard a Triangular Fishing Pole Farm.<br/>
Find a small sweetgum beyond; from it, course approximately North for 26 <br/>
Small Woman Steps.<br/>
Make your way into the Farm at 300 degrees for about 6 Small Woman Steps.<br/>
Behind a barricade of dead rods you will find the crafty piece.<br/>
Leave the leaves....<br/>
<br/>
NOS. 3 and 4 - THE TOE COOLER AND THE WEEPING TREE<br/>
Also at the SW end of the Big Wet (right near the portal to the Quilt), walk <br/>
the dirt to the closest asphalt.<br/>
Cross asphalt, and follow the Orange Tips right, right, right, and up, up, <br/>
up, then down to skinny wet.<br/>
Follow creek to intersection at another Orange Tip, and here make your <br/>
choice:<br/>
To find the Toe Cooler, continue straight with skinny left on your right.  <br/>
After 1/3 mile or so (following Orange Tips and the Mower), step across so <br/>
the skinny wet is on your left, and continue to the Mason's Pride, whence <br/>
from the wet flows.  Go in and see for yourself the rubble pile on the right <br/>
with treasure beneath.<br/>
To find the Weeping Tree, cross the skinny wet to the right at the Orange <br/>
Tip intersection, and follow right again, right on asphalt, over bridge, and <br/>
left to more Orange Tips up and up with the Mower.   Follow on up ridge of <br/>
oaks and see the fence ahead with Weeping Tree behind.  Go through the gate.<br/>
Stop to understand how the beauty of this place could make one weep.  Find <br/>
your dear treasure cradled in Cherry's weeping bosom.<br/>
<br/>
NO. 5 - THE OLD OAK<br/>
Compass Needed.<br/>
Park at the Outdoor Center.<br/>
Walk between the Old House and the Old Horse Barn, up the Westover Trail.<br/>
Stay right with the hikers up to Sign No. 3.<br/>
