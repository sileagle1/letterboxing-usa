my "Off Season" series.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I confess, I have no "Master Plan" . . .  I'm just making this <br/>
up as I go along.  So here's a hint: you may want to save your <br/>
answers from any of the boxes you complete. (LOL  does that give <br/>
you a hint of what the basis for VLb#4 is?)  If you are on the Honor <br/>
Roll for any of the first 3 boxes but did not save your answer <br/>
sheets, email me and I'll give you my copies so you don't have to re-<br/>
do the work from those boxes again.<br/>
<br/>
The link is here:<br/>

<br/>
Congrats to those who've completed any of the prior boxes! You've <br/>
been added to the Honor Roll pages. I just LOVE that I'm getting <br/>
email from kids who are doing (and even solving!) VLb all by <br/>
themselves!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
