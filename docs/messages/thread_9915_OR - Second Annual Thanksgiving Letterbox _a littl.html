Description:<br/>
<br/>
OK, this is a little late in being placed, but we wanted to <br/>
start/maintain a tradition.<br/>
<br/>
George Rogers Park, in addition to many recreational facilities, is home <br/>
to the first iron smelter west of the Rockies. Built in 1865, and going <br/>
into production in 1867, this smelter produced over 40,000 tons of pig <br/>
iron in its lifetime, processing ore mined from the surrounding <br/>
countryside.  It remained in operation until 1885 when a cheaper supply <br/>
of iron was available in nearby Portland, brought in as ballast in the <br/>
many ships coming to the port. The original smelter can still be seen at <br/>
George Rogers Park today. The 36 foot square chimney stack is built of <br/>
basalt quarried from the area, and its foundation extends 12 feet below <br/>
ground to solid rock. The 42-foot high chimney is the only reminder of <br/>
the pioneer dream of building a "Pittsburgh of the West."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
<br/>
Park in the lower parking lot, nearest the river.<br/>
<br/>
Your trek will take you back through time, from Gothic, to Roman, to <br/>
Stone Ages.<br/>
<br/>
First, find the Gothic Arches. From the stone pillar near the arch, <br/>
proceed 120 paces at a heading of 170 degrees (magnetic) to a crossroad. <br/>
  At the crossroad, take the high road or the low road, but not the <br/>
middle way.  (The low road is more traveled and flatter and meets the <br/>
high road  down the path.)  If you take the low road, continue on the <br/>
main path (to the left) at the Y.<br/>
<br/>
Proceed under the Roman Arches, and continue back in time to find a tree <br/>
devouring a boulder on the right.  The letterbox resides within a Stone <br/>
crevice about knee high on the opposite side of the trail.<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Always take adequate precautions (such as prodding with a stick <br/>
and/or wearing gloves) before reaching into dark crevasses and holes in <br/>
the wild. Before you set out read the waiver of responsibility and <br/>
disclaimer.<br/>
