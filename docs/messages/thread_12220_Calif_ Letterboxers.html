We are going up to Willows, Ca. and should be there 4/25 to 5/5 for the state shoot. We are looking for any unpublished clues/ boxes in the area. I have already printed out those that are listed as of 3/22. We probably won't be going past Redding on this trip. Any one have any secret boxes or neat hikes in the area that needs a letterbox? <br/>
 Now here's the other info piece - We are planning on being back home in Kernville for the weekend of 5/10,5/11.If any one is interested in an unofficial gathering we still have many untapped boxes in and around Kernville, and I'm planning to plant a whitewater letterbox series that weekend.This would give the folks that came a chance to do some whitewater rafting as well as collect some stamps. We won't have the opportunity to do much preplanning due to our trip but  we could be reached via a e mail on or about 5/7 or via phone (we be in da book) and set up a meeting place at circle park or at our house depending on numbers.
