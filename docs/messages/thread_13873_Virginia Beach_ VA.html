Anyone with suggestions of boxes "not to miss" in the area.<br/>
I know there was a recent discussion of MIA boxes. Does anyone have a recent <br/>

<br/>
&gt; Virginian Pilot - last time I went the stamp and log were out for <br/>
repair but we did meet a wonderful bagpiper and put a HH in the box.  <br/>
I know the HH isn't there because Del just found it in one of her <br/>
boxes up north.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The Elusive Red Wolf<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sparky's Friend - I found this one in pieces and scattered last <br/>
time I was home.  My dad and I repaired it and replaced it so, <br/>
hopefully, it should still be there.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; John and Jackie's Wacky Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Fat Flying Valentine--FFV3 - this one is pretty new but is hard to <br/>
put back so be careful when you find it and replace it.  I hope to <br/>
modify it for better hiding when I go home in a few weeks.<br/>

Fat Flying Valentine is a tough one.  I may be looking in the wrong<br/>

The wacky box is there and in good condition.<br/>
Sparky's friend was there a couple months ago when I found it.<br/>
Fort story was supposed to be recarved and adopted so I dunno what's going<br/>
on with that one.  It's been a year.<br/>
Virginian Pilot is in a good hiding spot so It may still be there.  Beena<br/>
year for that one too.<br/>
<br/>
The back beyond the bridge box, it is possible that the park rangers found<br/>
it and got rid of it.  They area it is in is a national wildlife refuge.<br/>
But dont let that stop you.  I heard Ovals of Cassini was missing and I<br/>
found it yesterday.<br/>

we didn't know it and so I've copied the clues directly onto the Letterbox<br/>

<br/>
Hope it is still there - it is a very remote placement and you almost have<br/>
to go on bikes, I think - but then you can ride back on the beach and that<br/>
is very cool.<br/>
