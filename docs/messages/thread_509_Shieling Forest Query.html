&gt; Hi everybody! I'm proud to report that FINALLY, Finally, I actually went to <br/>
&gt; hunt down a letterbox!  My sister Betsey and I met at Shieling Forest in <br/>
&gt; Peterborough, NH, to look for Nisa's box there.  I was hoping to change the <br/>
&gt; second half of my quotient to F1, but alas, no such luck.  Shieling Forest <br/>
&gt; is a small, pretty woods, with very easy, accessible trails, quiet streams, <br/>
&gt; and a nice wildflower garden as well.  A good place to take kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We did our best to follow Nisa's clue, but got stumped from the very first <br/>
&gt; line: "Follow the "brave" path until you reach the giants of the forest."  <br/>
&gt; We couldn't tell, either from the paths' names or from their markings what <br/>
&gt; would make one of them "brave."  So we simply investigated all of them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next lines were a challenge as well: "Stand where the two were once <br/>
&gt; whole. Walk approximately 30 paces east (more if you're vertically <br/>
&gt; challenged) to the 'white pearl' in the ground."  This could have been a <br/>
&gt; path that forked (several did), a tree whose trunk branched into two (we saw <br/>
&gt; that too), or even the two banks of a stream.  However, no matter how we <br/>
&gt; tried, walking 30 paces east from any of these spots did not lead to a <br/>
&gt; "white pearl" (a stone????).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, no luck.  Is it cheating to ask Nisa or anyone who has found the <br/>
&gt; Shieling Forest box for a hint or two--at least an idea of where we went <br/>
&gt; wrong?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope you all had a great weekend--<br/>

Dear Bonnie,<br/>
<br/>
I remember being a little stumped by the "brave" reference too. (Nisa <br/>
explained it to me later but I've forgotten!) But there was a map of <br/>
the forest posted by the parking lot, and it did suggest where the <br/>
giants of the forest were. Once there, you'll understand the <br/>
significance of "where the two were once whole." Then it's not hard <br/>
to take bearings and find the white pearl.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think Nisa or others would object to this low level of <br/>
clarification :-} <br/>
<br/>
You know that I know from my experience at Wendell <br/>
that second visits often pay good dividends. Give Peterborough <br/>
another shot. (And come to Braintree this summer too!)<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

No I don't think it's cheating, but you should do it in private correspondence with Nisa and leave it up to her.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you didn't find it, but it shounds like you had a good time anyway.  Personally, I've had "almost" as much fun on letterboxing hunts where I haven't found the box, as those thatwere more succesful.<br/>

Thanks, JDW.  Yes, we DID have a good time.  To me, roaming around in a <br/>
forest for a couple of hours is always fun, letterboxing or not.  I was <br/>
wondering, what's the "F3/4" mean?  You found three-quarters of a box?<br/>

I thought it was a fun clue and vote to not change it. :-)   <br/>
<br/>
Of course, my theory is that the point of letterboxing is to get out<br/>
to a cool place, and if you find the box, so much the better, but<br/>
that finding the box in and of itself need not always be a gimme<br/>

stumped once in a while, the game could lose its luster.<br/>

I can't agree with Randy on this one--my goal is to get the stamp in my<br/>
little book and put mine in the one in the box.  Neat place is good, but it<br/>
isn't my primary interest!  (But we're all entitled to our opinions,<br/>
right?)  Sheila's box was hard enough for me to find that it took me 3<br/>
tries--and for me the fun was runnin' out.  I WANTED TO FIND THE BOX!  So,<br/>
I'd say change it.  But it's completely up to you!<br/>
