<br/>
<br/>Again, the MA gathering on Saturday was great!  I had a blast and really would like to thank Rustypuff and CSCM for all of their hard work!  On the way home, Team Green Dragon, Letterboxer2002, Wanda and Pete, Moonstone Baby, and I found Carolyn's new box Sister Street, Sister Town (?).  Since we were there in the dark, I'm hoping to go back soon during the daylight so I can read all of the tombstones.  I'm surprised they got me into a cemetery at night, with all of the Easton (CT) haunted cemetery stories Darrin used to tell me..... 
<br/>
<br/>On Sunday, Letterboxer2002 and I ventured out from my parents' house in Charlestown RI to Wanda and Pete's house to grab the house box, and for some nice conversation!  We then ventured out to Dancing Men (I totally promise that Alan did all of the work himself!) and then onto Pine Barrens of RI.  While up there, we found another box, Morning Coffee Letterbox, but I won't tell where!!!!!!  We also went to Alan's Mystery Box, for his first anniversary of letterboxing (clues went out to the list last night), and to the Tribal Nation Letterboxes, finally getting out past dark!  OK... it was totally my fault.  Jay says you can either keep going on the blue until you get back to the road, or go back the way you came, I said to keep going on blue.  It's an easier walk than the other, but if you are running out of daylight, I would go back the way you came!  It seemed really long!
<br/>
<br/>Today, I went to Letterboxer2002's anniversary box from Butterfly, built my gazebo (yes, I did ride all the way out to Danielson!), and found the Indian and the Water Fountain box #2 which was missing when D and I went over the summer.  After finishing my gazebo up in Hebron, I passed my old high school to go searching for Deertracks in the snow by Blackledge Falls, almost getting my car stuck in the process!  The turnoff for Blackledge Falls is SO slippery (as are the trails, since the snowmobiles have packed it down into a hard icy substance), that I wondered if I was going to get my car out, with the cars whipping down the hill from Glastonbury.  I was victorious, since there just happened to be no cars coming (which is a major miracle in itself.... if you live out there, like I used to, you know exactly what I'm talking about!).
<br/>
<br/>All in all, a great weekend!  It was so nice to see so many people I knew, as well as some new faces!  Happy Trails everyone!

Hi dan, and welcome to the wonderful passtime of letterboxing. It is <br/>
very addictive and leads you to so many places you would never go <br/>
otherwise.  An example  here in Ct. we have a Stearns Rd. Mansfield <br/>
and then driving around prior to the gatheringI found Stearns Rd. <br/>
mansfield , Ma. So the box is in Ma. near your home  the directions <br/>
are from  Rte 106 in Mansfield and its easy to find - hey I just <br/>
stumbled across it but then I think that was meant to be.  That box <br/>
is a micro box bring ink and a pen. have fun , leader of the Pack<br/>
