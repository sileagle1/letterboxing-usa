<br/>
I'd be interested in talking with folks who have first hand <br/>
experience with the boxes in Independence Oaks park in SE Michigan.  <br/>
My wife and I went and looked for all five and came up with a big fat <br/>
0.<br/>
<br/>
First we tried Dragonflies Are Free.  We are pretty sure we found the <br/>
spot but that the box is probably gone.<br/>
<br/>
Then we tried Ladies of the Lake and think we got in the general area <br/>
but found the last couple of clues to vague for us to pinpoint a <br/>
location.<br/>
<br/>
Next it was on to This Place Rocks and we think we found the bench <br/>
but it wasn't facing the right direction.  We didn't even come close <br/>
to finding this one.<br/>
<br/>
49 Habitat Trail - we think we found the final resting place but no <br/>
box, and we did a fairly thorough search even with all the biting <br/>
ants.<br/>
<br/>
Independent Oak gave us fits.  We couldn't figure out any of clues <br/>
other than the starting place.<br/>
<br/>
This was our first letterbox outing in the area since we moved and it <br/>
was disappointing to come up with only one.  Although the one we came <br/>
up with was fun, because we were the first to stamp Guardians' Pointe <br/>
in Rochester Hills.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
I personally have done all the Independence Oaks boxes, as well as recently<br/>
taking them over as caretaker. Unfortunately, I am currently 9 months<br/>
pregnant and have been unable to go out personally to check on their status.<br/>
Fortunately however, a very kind fellow boxer, Delirium, recently made a<br/>
visit and gave the following sitrep:<br/>
<br/>
This Place Rocks is still there and she did some upkeep on it.<br/>
<br/>
Dragon Flies Are Free may be missing.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies of the Lake may have been vandalized.<br/>
<br/>
49 Habitat trail was still there and in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
Independent Oak is still there and as tough as ever.  It took me two tries<br/>
to get it <smile> and many other folks several attempts.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me privately if you want hints about these boxes.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Puppylover<br/>
