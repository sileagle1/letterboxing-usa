It has come to our attention that there are many letterboxes at White <br/>
Memorial.  You will need to get permission for any box(es) you have <br/>
here.  You can contact me and I can go out and look at any you may <br/>
have here.  We are not against letterboxing, but need to know where <br/>
they are so they do not interfere with things we have going on here.  <br/>
Any help spreading the word to others that have letterboxes here <br/>
would be appreciated.<br/>

Thank you,<br/>

Since he asked for help spreading the word, I decided to post his <br/>
information here.  I have already replied with clues to my box <br/>
(Connecticut Yankee) and I hope he allows it to stay.  It sounds like <br/>
he just wants to know where the boxes are, so cooperation may let us <br/>
keep letterboxing in this park.  I don't live in CT, otherwise I <br/>
would volunteer to meet with him.  Maybe someone up that way can do <br/>
this to smooth the way for letterboxing?  Just a thought.<br/>

to get my boxes approved. I was going to offer to walk yours for you <br/>

If anyone else needs a stand in walker, I'm willing to do it but <br/>
would need your permission to remove or replant if necessary.<br/>
