 I just wanted to let you know we moved the Whisper Letterbox today. I've<br/>
been wanting to move it because I think it was too easy and I wanted to give<br/>
you a longer hike. I also chose to direct searchers to park in a safer<br/>
location so they wouldn't have to cross a busy road. The weather was<br/>
wonderful today here on Long Island, warm enough to wear just a vest, with a<br/>
slight breeze so we didn't overheat as we hiked.<br/>
 When we found the box it seemed kind of heavy. To our surprise it was full<br/>
of water! Thank goodness the zip-lock bag held and everything was dry. I<br/>
definitely recommend it in all Letterboxes. Well it's now in a dryer<br/>
location, and I hope it will get more visitors (hint, hint).<br/>
<br/>
Happy searching,<br/>
Ed<br/>

We'll have to ferry over to Lon Gisland for some searching this spring.<br/>
Could we bike from Montauk, or is that too far?<br/>

Thanks Jay,<br/>
 I think Montauk is too far from the Greenbelt boxes, but I hid a box<br/>
at the Montauk Lighthouse State Park last year.<br/>
 We will have to visit Conn. again. I noticed a lot of new boxes there!<br/>
