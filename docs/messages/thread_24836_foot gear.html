My husband and I are brand new to letterboxing. We have found five out <br/>
of six attemps since last Sunday.<br/>
My question is how do you keep all the prickly things out of your <br/>
shoes? It is the only unfun thing about this great adventure. Thanks <br/>

On the other hand, I do have that problem when I go butterflying--for that I usually wear my garden boots from Wal-Mart with pants tucked in and insect repellant liberally sprayed around the tops.  Protection against brambles, poison ivy, and ticks!<br/>
