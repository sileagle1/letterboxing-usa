I've been thinking about this issue for quite a while, but felt perhaps<br/>
we'd been using "Letterboxing USA" for too long to suggest a change.<br/>
<br/>
However, I also can forsee placing a few boxes in Canada, and, as<br/>
likely, we might just get a few Canadians involved. I work close enough<br/>
to Canada (greater Burlington area) to have 3 commuters (albeit on<br/>
weekends) from north of the border. <br/>
<br/>
If this can be accomplished, I'd be in favor of the change.<br/>

That would be outstanding for a listing in the ILC catalog! Please do <br/>
list them. As I mentioned, I will be reworking the catalog (over the next <br/>
week) to make it very easy to list your boxes. Thanks!<br/>

Subject: [L-USA] naming airball<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;This idea is probably an airball, but I'd figure while were talking<br/>
&gt;about naming, suggesting "Letterboxing North America".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Like others, I dislike some of the nationalistic stuff.  So, replace<br/>
&gt;a political entity with a geograpic one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One could argue that it tries to "take over" other countries in<br/>
&gt;North America.  I don't look at it that way, in part because I do<br/>
&gt;not look at things nationalistically, and because to those who do,<br/>
&gt;its a welcome for other locales in North America to become part of<br/>
&gt;it.  I certainly intend to place boxes in Canada someday; there are<br/>
&gt;too many geographical nooks and crannies to pass up ;-)<br/>

I can't help but agree with Randy.  I too will be traveling some in Canada<br/>
and probably south of the border.<br/>
<br/>
 The Canadians are avid nature lovers and hikers.  When I am up there I<br/>
can't tell the difference in the borders except an occasional "eh"!<br/>
<br/>
They in turn I expect will travel through the U.S. to collect our boxes.<br/>
It will be a pleasure to satisfy my goals of salting B.C. and Edmonton in<br/>
the next  few years.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just a continent loyalist here in Kansas City.....<br/>
