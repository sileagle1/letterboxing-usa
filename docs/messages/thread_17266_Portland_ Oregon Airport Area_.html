<br/>
     I'm new to this group and fairly new to Letterboxing (what a <br/>
great, new sport!!!), but I love it already.<br/>
<br/>
     Anyway, I'm heading to the "Portland Airport" next weekend to <br/>
pick up my brother at 12:30 on Sunday and I was wondering if there <br/>
were any Letterboxes that were kind of 'quick and easy' and near the <br/>
Airport that I could find before going to get him??  I'm coming from <br/>
Springfield and am not 'real' familiar with the Portland area (but <br/>
with all the letterboxes located near there will hopefully become <br/>
more familiar with it).<br/>
<br/>
     Any thoughts or information would be great!!! I would love to be <br/>
able go out and find one next weekend!<br/>
<br/>
THANKS.<br/>
<br/>

Welcome to the world of letterboxing addiction. My Rocky Butte box is quite close to <br/>
the Airport as is Canada Goose's Grotto letterbox. I'm not sure if this last box is in <br/>
place but I'm pretty sure mine is. I'll give it a check this week and I'll let you know if <br/>
it's missing.  Have you discovered the PNW Talk List yet? Funhog<br/>

     Thank you very much for your reply.  The Rocky Butte box sounds <br/>
like a lot of fun. I will check it out... and I'm looking forward to <br/>
finding some of your other ones.  I've noticed that you have several <br/>
around...even in Colorado!  I told my brother, who lives there, and <br/>
he is going to try to get to them.<br/>
     Thanks for your help and for taking the time to make all <br/>
your 'Letterboxes' and distibuting them.<br/>
Talk you later,<br/>
:) Cruzkontrol<br/>
