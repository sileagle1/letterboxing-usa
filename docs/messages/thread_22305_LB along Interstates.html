Hey, that is a great site!  I was not familiar with it.  It did indeed bring up quite a few LBs near my route of travel. Thanks so much.<br/>
<br/>
Another subject: I recently found a box in Chesterfield VA, near Richmond.  In addition to the stamp and album there was some coins and a whistle.  I contacted the placer and she responded that she was unaware these items were in her LB.  Does that sound like a geocacher has hijacked the box?<br/>
