                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found a hitchhiker in the first box I found - kinda like <br/>
hitting a homerun on the first pitch. and I ran into the <br/>
same problem you did - the next box was too small - <br/>
so I waited - I couldn't find the next box - and more <br/>
time went by - I felt guilty and tried an easier series of <br/>
boxes and then I dropped off the hitchhiker - So I <br/>
guess my advice is don't worry - you'll drop it off soon <br/>
enough and if you don't want the pressure just <br/>
stamp your book and leave it for the next guy (or gal)<br/>

The HH's we've found in the past have had their own "homes", so that <br/>
when placed at the next box they didn't have to actually go into the <br/>
box but be placed with it.  In fact we liked the idea so much that <br/>
for the HH's we've put out we also put them in their own boxes.  <br/>
So in response to your question, you could get one of those cheapy <br/>
boxes from the store and give it a traveling home or just wait until <br/>
you find a box big enough to hold it.<br/>
