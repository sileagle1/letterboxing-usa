<br/>
<br/>With the end of summer and my eminent return to college looming on the horizon, we took advantage of excellent weather to take a drive to the far western part of Massachusetts for three boxes.
<br/>
<br/>The first stop was to plant a new box (clues coming later tonight!) in our absolute favorite place. This was going to be our first box, but the stamp wasn't ready, so it turns out to be number four.
<br/>
<br/>The first hunt was at the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge, MA. Nice place, nice stamp. We found the box partially exposed, and took greater pains to rehide it after stamping in. 
<br/>
<br/>Monument Mountain was right down the road, so we headed there next. After one false start, we found the correct place. This box has been out for a good long time, but has had suprisingly few visitors considering that. Still, we saw lots of familar stamps, and travelling here gave me a great idea for one I want to carve.....
<br/>
<br/>Last stop was for the Eagle Ledges in October Mountain State Park. The box is a new one, and we just missed meeting some other boxers who apparantly had been there earlier in the day. With all the trails out here, it begs for more boxes!

<br/>
<br/>I couldn't agree more about Mt. Greylock. We're planing on putting boxes in the Chester-Blandford State Forest, Glendale Falls, Knightville Dam and a few other places. The hard part is coming up with stamps to place as a series, or stamps that make sense for where they end up. I like it when the stamps tell a story, or have some meaning. We just got carving supplies last weekend, and I'm totally hooked on carving now. :-)
