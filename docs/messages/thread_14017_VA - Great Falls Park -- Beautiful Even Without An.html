cannot believe (once again) that we have lived here for 12 years (this <br/>
stint) and several more at an earlier time and never been to this park.  It <br/>
is huge, it is beautiful, the falls are "awesome" as Be would say and it is <br/>
right around the corner.  It is hard to believe that such nature exists so <br/>
close to DC.<br/>
<br/>
We took a couple of the trails (easy, but fun due to the <br/>
ups/downs/rocks/etc. which made them a little more interesting) and gazed <br/>
out at several of the overlooks (keeping Miss Ma well back from the cliff <br/>
edges where she was clamoring to go...)<br/>
<br/>
Another astonishing thing was the high water mark post.  You have to <br/>
understand, these falls are huge, yet, on numerous occasions, the waters <br/>
have actually filled this great gorge, climbed these cliff walls (people <br/>
repel down) and fan out across these grassy fields to the heights over my <br/>
head.  OK -- I'm kind of petit, but over Da's head.  OK so he's not that <br/>
tall either.  But, if I stood on his shoulders with Ma on mine and Be on <br/>
hers (she weighs more and would have to go first) AND placed Ha on her hind <br/>
legs reaching up -- we still probably wouldn't reach the highest flood <br/>
markings.  Geez -- and I get frazzled when the local roads flood!<br/>
<br/>
There were kayakers to watch -- rowing against the tide and then whipping <br/>
down the rapids (don't want to give Miss Ma any ideas) and rock climbers and <br/>
repellers (shut Miss Ma's eyes again...), lots of fun people to watch and an <br/>
open snack bar with several varieties of ice cream!<br/>
<br/>
Wow!  For those who haven't been -- it's a really neat place.  Just thought <br/>
we would pass on the word.  Happy Fourth! BeMa<br/>

You MIGHT be able to plant boxes there. Supposedly at some national<br/>
parks, if you get the management's approval beforehand, you'll be told<br/>
a specific area in the national park where you can plant. Go, Team BeMa!<br/>
