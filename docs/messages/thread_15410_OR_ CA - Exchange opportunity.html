I just planted a box in Fairfield on Wednesday but haven't posted the clues yet - look <br/>
for them to appear sometime this weekend, if all goes well.  There's not much else in <br/>
that general area - probably Davis or Martinez are the only other boxes nearby.  <br/>

I would love to have an exchange if I can swing it. I work the 19th and have <br/>
commitments on the 20th but where I live (Davis) is only 25 miles east of <br/>
Fairfield on Hwy 80 and there are several letterboxes here so you'd be getting <br/>
more than just a couple of 'Xs' if you put Davis on your map. <br/>
<br/>
Which way are you traveling when you're around Fairfield? What highways?<br/>
