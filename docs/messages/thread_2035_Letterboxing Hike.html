&gt;Saturday March 11th, EMS will be hosting another letterboxing <br/>
&gt;hike/get-together at Lantern Hill near Foxwoods Casino. We'll be meeting <br/>
&gt;at the "parking-area" at 10am on that day (see clues on the site for <br/>
&gt;directions to Tribal Nation). Will most likely be doing the Tribal Nation <br/>
&gt;boxes and the Little Dam series. Undecided if we will place any boxes <br/>
&gt;along the way but there's always the possibility. Actually, I'm itching to <br/>
&gt;put out a box heavily laden with vectors.<br/>
&gt;So, if yer interested, drop me a note offlist at mailto:enicltrbxr@netzero.net<br/>
&gt;This hike is also in conjunction with the Ct Forest and Park Association <br/>
&gt;so there may be a good crowd on this hike. Think of the x-count <br/>
&gt;possibilities! Dogs are welcome of course.<br/>

<br/>
    Lantern Hill is going to be busy this month, below is a copy of a press<br/>
release from the Westerly Morris Men.  (Here is a link to the Morris Men's<br/>
web site<br/>
 http://www.riconnect.com/crandall-land/Westerly%20Morris%20Men.htm )  It is<br/>
a great way to bring in the spring and we have lots of fun.  I hope to see a<br/>
number of letterboxers there to watch us dance.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

PRESS RELEASE PRESS RELEASE<br/>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br/>
MARCH 20, 2001 - VERNAL EQUINOX SUNRISE DANCE ON LANTERN HILL<br/>
<br/>
    The Westerly Morris Men will celebrate the last Vernal Equinox of the<br/>
Second Millennium by dancing at dawn on the summit of Lantern Hill in North<br/>
Stonington, Connecticut. The Vernal Equinox is the moment at which the<br/>
center of the Sun lies precisely above the Earth's equator, astronomically<br/>
marking the beginning of Spring.<br/>
<br/>
    Participants in the hike and festivities will start meeting at the base<br/>
of the hill at 5:00 A.M. on March 20. By 5:20 A.M., all present will start<br/>
the 10-20 minute hike to the summit. Sunrise will occur at about 5:51 A.M.<br/>
<br/>
    Lantern Hill is located on the Ledyard / North Stonington town line,<br/>
just south of Route 2. The trailhead is on Wintechog Hill Road, which is one<br/>
road east of Lantern Hill Road / Route 214, the location of the Foxwoods<br/>
Casino. The trailhead is less than 1/4 mile south of Route 2.<br/>
<br/>
    The Vernal Equinox hike was originally started by Betsy Oller of the<br/>
Pequotsepos Outing Club, of Mystic. Morris dancing was introduced to the<br/>
event in 1987.<br/>
<br/>
    The public is invited and welcome to this open annual event. Last year,<br/>
more than 100 people were on hand.<br/>
The actual Equinox will occur at 8:31 A.M. EST, March 20 (Source: U.S. Naval<br/>
Observatory via the National Weather Service web site at<br/>
http://www.nws.noaa.gov/er/box). This hike traditionally occurs at the dawn<br/>
of the day in which the Equinox falls in the Eastern Time Zone.<br/>
<br/>
    According to the Weather Service web site, the Vernal Equinox will occur<br/>
on March 20 through at least the year 2005, therefore, long-range planners<br/>
can place this event on their calendars on March 20 every year through 2005!<br/>
<br/>
    The contact for this event is Norman Dudziak of Barrington, RI, phone #<br/>
401-437-0240. For background information on Morris dancing, team founder and<br/>
chief musician Peter Liebert of Preston, CT, may be contacted at phone #<br/>
860-887-9184 or 439-2741.<br/>
<br/>
This event occurs regardless of the weather, solely at the discretion of the<br/>
participants.<br/>
