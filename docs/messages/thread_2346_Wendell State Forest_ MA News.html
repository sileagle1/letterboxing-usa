                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone.  Since 1998 I've had three letterboxes hidden at Wendell <br/>
State Forest in western Massachusetts. <br/>
<br/>
The clues are here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.crocker.com/~bsennott/wendell.html<br/>
<br/>
I'm planning on retiring those three boxes and replacing them with a <br/>
new box (or boxes) somewhere else in Wendell State Forest.  The clues <br/>
for the new box will go on the same Web page, so no work is required <br/>
for the Webmasters (as far as I can tell).<br/>
<br/>
I anticipate gathering up the current 3 boxes and hiding the new one(s) <br/>
before the end of May. So, if you were planning on a visit to Wendell <br/>
State Forest, check the Web page before you go for up-to-date clues. As <br/>
soon as I've hidden the new box, I'll post the clues (most likely the <br/>
same day).<br/>
<br/>
This means that the three current Wendell boxes will soon have <br/>
"collector's item" status!  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I plan to revisit my other Massachusetts boxes in early summer and <br/>
replace notepads or containers as needed.  If anyone has news about the <br/>
condition/existence of the North Quabbin Reservoir boxes or North Mount <br/>
Sugarloaf, let me know.<br/>

&gt; This means that the three current Wendell boxes will soon have<br/>
&gt; "collector's item" status!<br/>
<br/>
And one of them (El Corazon) being a presumed state first will make it<br/>
even more challenging to get all 50 of those ... (I wonder if anyone<br/>
besides me is trying to do this ...)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If anyone has news about the condition/existence of the North Quabbin <br/>
&gt; Reservoir boxes <br/>
<br/>
I can report that these boxes were in fine shape as of May 9th, 1999,<br/>
as of course, was Quabbinhenge :-)<br/>

Dartmoor boxes are "lifers." These boxes are a few years old and, <br/>
quite frankly, I think the hiding places and clues are not the best.  <br/>
Wendell State Forest is a great place, so I'll definitely keep a box <br/>
or two there.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to give people an incentive to revisit Wendell :-)<br/>

 We were planning on heading up that way on Sunday.  Do you think you will<br/>
have removed them already?<br/>
