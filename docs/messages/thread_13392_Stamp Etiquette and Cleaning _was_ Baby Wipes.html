                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, there is one very famous stamp that "flutters" about at certain<br/>
gatherings made from, I believe, Mars Carve. I would estimate it's been<br/>
used at least a couple of hundred times. That I know of, it has not been<br/>
cleaned on a regular basis, if at all.would almost be sacrilege to do<br/>
so. Those of you who have really looked at it know what I mean. The<br/>
patina on its surface is quite as beautiful as the image it creates. The<br/>
stamp still strikes a near perfect image after surviving untold<br/>
applications of both dye and pigment inks. <br/>
<br/>
If I run across a stamp in a letterbox here in  CT/RI/MA that is<br/>
particularly messy, I gently wipe it off or more likely blot with a soft<br/>
paper towel. The brand, Viva, is the softest I have found and quickly<br/>
absorbs much of the surface ink.  If the bag the stamp is in is messy, I<br/>
replace it, but before I return the stamp to it, I wrap a small square<br/>
of paper towel around it as many people do here in New England. I cut<br/>
sheets of Viva into quarters and carry with me. If a stamp looks like it<br/>
will continue to be messy and if there is room, I leave two or there<br/>
quarters of paper toweling in the box. <br/>
<br/>
As with all art, a hand carved stamp is ephemeral. That being said,<br/>
whatever each person can do to take a little time to carefully prolong<br/>
its life is a gift to the next person who encounters it. This is<br/>
especially true as many carver/letterboxers are leaving eraser carving<br/>
behind for intricately carved stamps that take hours to complete. It is<br/>
very frustrating when we find a box or check our own boxes and encounter<br/>
a mess that was left by someone who seemed to have valued the "F" more<br/>
than demonstrating respect for the box's creator and for those who would<br/>
come by later to enjoy it.   Likewise, if a box is cracked or a finder<br/>
does not have extra baggies or towels to clean up a leak or mess, as<br/>
often happens, a quick nod to the owner for follow-up is always greatly<br/>
appreciated. <br/>

Well, I don't think so, as you'd be using a really small amount and wash<br/>
it <br/>
away (the wipes solution stays of the stamp) - but I've used unscented<br/>
soap <br/>
products for so long due to allergies I've forgotten there's any other<br/>
kind!<br/>
<br/>
Our area doesn't see the letterboxing traffic that seems to occur in the<br/>
<br/>
New England states - after seeing what some of the local stamps look<br/>
like <br/>
after a few dozen visitors, I was wondering what the experiences of New <br/>
Englanders are - do the stamps get really gummy, do people generally<br/>
clean <br/>
them after use,  are there any cleaning tips you could share, or is this<br/>
<br/>
not even an issue?<br/>

&gt;Wouldn't detergent have the same 'scent' drawback as baby wipes?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Dye inks clean up much<br/>
&gt; &gt; easier - the best way to clean up after pigment ink is with a<br/>
toothbrush,<br/>
&gt; &gt; dish detergent and running water, especially with intricate stamps.<br/>
We're<br/>
&gt; &gt; considering carrying an old tooth brush loaded with a little<br/>
detergent,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then using our drinking water bottle to rinse stamps off.<br/>

That is an excellent idea! Our fancy pruning shears are hanging in <br/>
the garage with a sock toe  covering the blades to keep them nice and <br/>
dry.Why not use them to keep precious stamps safe and clean?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I saw some of these in Michigan. Well, I know some dogs are drawn to human<br/>
scent (I'm sure it would probably help the famous Molly find more boxes<br/>
:-o ), but I don't know if wild critters would be drawn to it or repelled by<br/>
it. Even if you wash the socks in an unscented detergent, feet being the<br/>
stinky things they are will leave a scent (actually any clothes will, just<br/>
ask any Police dog) :-).<br/>
Franzsolo and I (separately, but at the same time) came up with a design for<br/>
Stamp protectors that are very easy to make out of poster board or soft thin<br/>
foam. They protect the stamp in it's own little 'container' and help absorb<br/>
the excess ink and keep it off the baggie and other box contents.<br/>
SpringChick did a great job of demonstrating how to make them and even had<br/>
supplies and directions for everyone at the GL gathering. If she is not able<br/>
to share the directions with those that are interested, I can scan in my<br/>
copy (with her permission of course) and send it as an attachment to whom<br/>
ever requests it. Seems that would solve some of the problems and negate the<br/>
need for socks, paper towels, stamp cleaners, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents,<br/>
