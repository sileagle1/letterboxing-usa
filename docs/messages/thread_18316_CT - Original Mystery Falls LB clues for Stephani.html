anyone who had the clues please post them to this website.  So here <br/>
they are:<br/>
<br/>
Mystery Falls Letterbox<br/>
Placed 5/30/02 by Stephani, John, John Turner and Maggie the Dog<br/>
Duration of this walk could be anywhere from about an hour to three <br/>
hours, depending.<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is hidden along a section of the Narragansett Trail <br/>
near Green Falls Pond.  There are several ways to access this trail <br/>
but we recommend parking at the green gate on Green Falls Road.  To <br/>
get to Green Falls Road: turn on to Sand Hill Road from Route 49 in <br/>
Voluntown (this turn is marked by the Studio Farm which sits on the <br/>
corner); after turning left than right around one of the Palmer farms <br/>
in the area Green Falls Road goes straight while Wheeler Road bears <br/>
to the right; Green Falls Road quickly turns to a dirt road; the <br/>
Narragansett Trail (blue blazed) crosses once and a bit further up on <br/>
the left you will see the green gate; park here.<br/>
