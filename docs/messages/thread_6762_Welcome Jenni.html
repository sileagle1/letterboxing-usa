places around the BAY Area. We have recently planted The Cradle on <br/>
the Alameda Creek Trail. No one has visited it. It is a very small <br/>
box with just a crude stamp(since we are new to that art), a small <br/>
homemade notebook and pencil. We had fun at Byxbee park in Palo Alto. <br/>
We only found 1 of the boxes. IF you go there and find more let us <br/>
know. If you like camping, alpine lakes and swimming go check out the <br/>
New Hope mystery box. We read that Ruth's hybrid is still around. <br/>

Happy Hunting<br/>

&gt; Hello All,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hi, my name is Jenni and I just discovered Letterboxing yesterday! <br/>
I am an<br/>
&gt; avid rubberstamp and paper arts artist.... (collage, assemblage, <br/>
altered<br/>
&gt; books, mail art, artistamps, etc.) I regularly get the various <br/>
magazines<br/>
&gt; about rubber stamping and paper arts... well, in the latest issue <br/>
of "the<br/>
&gt; rubber stamper" there was an article on Letterboxing... a few hours <br/>
reading<br/>
&gt; on the net and here I am! this sounds so great! a chance to get out <br/>
and hike<br/>
&gt; :) see wonderful spots I would never know to find otherwise :) and <br/>
bring my<br/>
&gt; art with me!! :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; as of yet, I have not seen a box, lol. but I am raring to go! any <br/>
advice<br/>
&gt; anyone can give a virgin letterboxer? anyone have any idea where to <br/>
find<br/>
&gt; some clues specific to the SF bay area CA? (I'm in El Sobrante) <br/>
what is the<br/>
&gt; etiquette on placing a box if you have yet to find one? (I'd love <br/>
to place<br/>
&gt; one, hehe) any help on anything would be greatly appreciated!<br/>
