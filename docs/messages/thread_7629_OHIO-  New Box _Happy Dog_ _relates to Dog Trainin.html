                    <div class="plaintext-content">First some ground work This is the first box in what I hope to be a long series titled Happy Dog. I am a troop leader for a dog scout troop (no, its not a typo :-) &amp; one of the missions of Dog Scouts of America is to help educate the general dog owning public about their canine to accomplish (among other things) an increase in the bond between the species as well as prevent dogs from ending up in shelters. As a new means of spreading knowledge, the following clues need to be solved by knowing (or finding out) the correct answers to dog related questions. More about the non-profit group of Dog Scouts of America (&amp; maybe some of the answers) can be found at www.dogscouts.org  I hope you and your canine companion enjoy searching for these boxes &amp; will learn a bit in the process. Non-dog owners are welcome too!<br/>

Happy Dog Series- box #1<br/>
Location: Cincinnati, Ohio (Westside)<br/>
<br/>
County: Hamilton<br/>
<br/>
Park: Miami White Water Forest<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Sign said Level 4, but its not as bad as some Ive been on. Well kept trail.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Daily ($1) or yearly ($3) pass is required since its part of the Hamilton County park system. <br/>
<br/>
If your canine is with you, please respect the leash laws &amp; always clean up any dog waste. There is lots of wildlife on this trail, be sure your dog doesnt chase any critters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bonus: There are some flyers in the box that explain how to teach your dog how to greet people without jumping on them, to only chew on appropriate objects (not you or your stuff) &amp; to walk on a lead without pulling (no force or pain is used to teach these things). <br/>
