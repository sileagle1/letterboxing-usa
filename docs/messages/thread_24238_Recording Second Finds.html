<br/>
I think you need more info on the box thing.  Why'd you go back a 2nd <br/>
or 3rd time?  Did the clues change, stamp change?  If either of those <br/>
were true, I'd probably personally think of it as a new find.  But, <br/>
if it's the same stamp, same clues,and you just want back with a <br/>
friend or to see the area during a different season, I wouldn't think <br/>
it'd be an extra find.  I wouldn't stamp in their book or restamp my <br/>
book in those cases.<br/>
<br/>
As for the HH, I'd probably leave it for someone else.  I may stamp <br/>
in the book to let the owner know I found it a second time, but I <br/>
wouldn't restamp it in my book, take it with me or log it anywhere.<br/>

<br/>
The Wizard of Oz HH that Ed was referring to in the original question <br/>
posed, was mine and what you mentioned about contacting the owner, Lone <br/>
R, was exactly what Ed did.  I was very pleasantly surprised to hear <br/>
from him because I was a breath away from posting an "ally-ally in free" <br/>
on the NJ board asking if anyone had seen my HH in the past year or so.<br/>
<br/>
Ed, as I said in my email directly back to you, it was so nice and <br/>
thoughtful of you to have that feedback since I think most of us don't <br/>
hear as much about our hitchhikers as we do our regular boxes. <br/>
<br/>
It would not have mattered to me if it were left or if it were taken and <br/>
moved on again as I would trust the "call" that finder made at the <br/>
time.  For example, Ed, if this was the same box you had left the HH in <br/>
months ago and it was still there, then by all means, please take it and <br/>
move it to another box that sees more visitors.  That would be more than <br/>
fine with me too!  Someone who is more familiar with an area I have <br/>
never been to can call the shots far better than me from here in Ohio.  <br/>
It's the same golden rule concept that I think we all try to bring with <br/>
us in drying out logbooks, adding a recloseable bag or putting two more <br/>
rocks on top if you just found the one didn't do the job.  Again, in my <br/>
opinion, you letting your friend take the HH and move it on was a great <br/>
decision and sending me that update was perfect!  The bonus was knowing <br/>
the condition of the logbook and stamp were still in good condition <br/>
making it through a rough winter!  (Using my mastercard to come find <br/>
boxes in NJ~priceless!)  Sorry, I got carried away.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Ed for taking care and making the time!<br/>

     I thought I would start new debate...<br/>
<br/>
 When finding a stamp for the second time (or third...), do you log it?<br/>
<br/>
 Also, how do you handle finding a Hitch Hiker for the second time? I <br/>
 recently came across the Wizard of Oz HH for the second time but I was <br/>
 with a friend and gave it to her to replace somewhere else. Do you log <br/>
 it as another find?<br/>
<br/>
 I did stamp-in in both occasions and in my book too (and listed them <br/>
 all as 2nd finds).<br/>
<br/>
 What do you all do?<br/>

OK, I'm changing my opinion on this one. Today I found a hitchhiker that<br/>
I have found before. It had travelled to 2 other cities and then back to<br/>
my town.<br/>
<br/>
I now feel that logging all finds, at least on AQ, (I don't think<br/>
locations are noted on LBNA) makes sense even if you've found it<br/>
multiple times. Recording the 2nd (or 3rd or more) find provides a<br/>
history of where the hitchhiker has been - which, on AQ, includes the<br/>
box names and the locations it has visited.<br/>
<br/>
(I took the HH home, I scanned the new stamp images and emailed them to<br/>
the owner of the HH.)<br/>

&gt; If I found a hitchhiker for the 2nd time I'd take it home and scan the<br/>
new stamps then email them to the owner (that is, if the owner is active<br/>
and responds to my emails the first time), then I'd move it along.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   But if I had my digital camera with me when I found the HH for the<br/>
2nd time, I'd photograph the new stamp images. I'd leave the HH in the<br/>
box. Once I got home I'd email the photos to the owner.<br/>

&gt;           A few times I have gone back for a stamp again, maybe I<br/>
didn't have the right colors the first time around or something. I'll<br/>
recolor and stamp it into my book, but I don't log it as a find again,<br/>
and I don't restamp into their logbook.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I haven't found a hh for a second time, but if I did, I would leave it<br/>
for the next person.<br/>

&gt; This is the beginning of a new day. You have been given this day to<br/>
use as you will. You can waste it or use it for good. What you do today<br/>
is important because you are exchanging a day of your life for it. When<br/>
tomorrow comes, this day will be gone forever, in its place is something<br/>
that you have left behind... let it be something good.<br/>
