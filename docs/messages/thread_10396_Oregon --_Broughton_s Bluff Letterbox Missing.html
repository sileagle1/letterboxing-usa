OR is temporarily missing.  It was mistakenly taken out as trash.  <br/>
Since they didn't notice their mistake until after leaving the <br/>
scene, they are mailing it to me and I will replace it as soon as I <br/>
am up in the Portland area again.<br/>
<br/>
The unsuspecting finder of this box also told me that there was a <br/>
certain "Love Parasite" inside the box.  And now it is being mailed <br/>
right to my appartment.  This will undoubtedly be the easiest HH <br/>
I've ever found!<br/>
