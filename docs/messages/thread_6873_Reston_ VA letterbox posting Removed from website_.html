It's only 75 cents to drive out to Robert Simon's dream, Reston, a <br/>
planned community of work, home and play in rolling Northern Virginia <br/>
among preserved woods.  These directions will take you through a <br/>
creek valley of tall trees in one of the natural areas of Reston, <br/>
Virginia.  From the Beltway, I-495, take the Dulles Toll Road, route <br/>
267, west to Hunter Mill Road.  Left on Hunter Mill and right on <br/>
Sunrise Valley Drive.  Take the third left onto Cross School Road.  <br/>
First Right on Midsummer Drive.  On your left you will come to <br/>
Dayflower Court.  There on the right is a small park.  Park.  Walk <br/>
between the two benches down a steep path and across a gully.  You'll <br/>
pass the first Christmas Tree Graveyard.  Follow the path down into <br/>
the woods all the way down into woodpecker valley.   Keep an ear open <br/>
for Woody Woodpecker's relatives.  Yes the big ones with the red <br/>
feather crowns live here.  Did you know you can tell which way is <br/>
north in a forest by observing which side the moss grows on trees?  <br/>
Be careful there is poison ivy around here.  You'll come to a T at <br/>
the path that runs the length of this small valley.  Turn right.  The <br/>
path heads north along the narrow swath cleared of trees for the <br/>
water line.  Look for tall dead trees with woodpecker holes.  You'll <br/>
pass a tall manhole cover and a muddy spring.  You're following a <br/>
creek way off to the side.  Along the way, you will also see tall <br/>
tree, split in two and way up high.  You'll come up to the creek <br/>
where you should cross it and continue following the narrow clear-cut <br/>
line.  Finally you'll come to a paved path.  Cross bridge 31.  Turn <br/>
left over the bridge onto a dirt path leading north along the creek <br/>
again.  Very soon the path will jog right and on the right, you'll <br/>
see a tall rotting tree stump.  Walk around it in a U-turn and follow <br/>
the fallen tree about 15 paces to the Christmas Tree Graveyard.<br/>
