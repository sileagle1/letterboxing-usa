A few more answers.  An exchange is when LB'rs meet.  They stamp into <br/>
each others books, thus they exchange stamp images.  It is a nice way <br/>
to get to know others at a gathering, like the one that happened <br/>
yesterday.  I am always interested in putting a face to the stamp <br/>
image.  After a while you see the same stamps over and over and they <br/>
become familiar as neighbors.  We often refer to each other by our <br/>
code names.<br/>
<br/>
A hitch hiker is a "letterbox" without a home.  Usually a stamp and a <br/>
note pad + / - a container ( at least needs a baggie set).  You put <br/>
the HH in a letterbox you visit and the next person to visit takes it <br/>
with them to the next box ( or sometime thereafter) that they visit.  <br/>
When you get a HH (1)stamp it into your notebook (2) stamp your stamp <br/>
into the HH notebook. (3) make sure the stamp of the letterbox you <br/>
found the HH in is stamped into the HH book as well.  Then (4) drop <br/>
it off at another box being sure to (5) stamp it into the new boxes <br/>
notebook and (6) stamp the new LB into the HH notebook.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of stamping around.<br/>
<br/>
Or give the HH to a member who travels a lot so you can get it "out <br/>
of Dodge".  This is the way Amanda ( who is an airline worker) gets <br/>
our Puget Sound HH back east and how we get to see stamps for people <br/>
we "know" like the Psychokiwis, Chuck and Molly etc.<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete?  Well everyone has met there stamp sooner or later.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on your adventures<br/>
