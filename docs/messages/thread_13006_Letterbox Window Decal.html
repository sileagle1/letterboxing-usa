<br/>
You can try the site's link for decals at....<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/regalia/orderforms.htm<br/>
<br/>
Or you can choose a different sticker at...<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000013.shtml<br/>
<br/>
which is Silent Doug's site. I am personally hyping his decal offering <br/>
b/c he was kind enough to post a very informative article on mounting a <br/>
handcarved stamp. Many thanks to Doug.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for your reference to Silent Doug's site.  I just finished his<br/>
article on mounting your stamps, and I'm checking out his other<br/>
articles.  <br/>
<br/>
I would like to comment, rubberstamp sellers who carry 'unmounted'<br/>
stamps usually carry a foam for mounting them, that is double-stick.<br/>
VERY easy to use, and you wouldn't have the concerns about the adhesive<br/>
being flat that Silent Doug mentions.  www.BiblicalImpressions.com<br/>
<http: www.biblicalimpressions.com=""></http:>  sells the stuff online and they<br/>
do not charge shipping/handling.  The only think I don't know is how it<br/>
will stand up to heat and cold.  I guess I'm just going to have to get a<br/>
letterbox planted so I can test it out, eh?!<br/>
