We wonder if anyone can anyone top this?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I find on an average almost 80 boxes a month, (1000 per year).  During the Monster Mash, I found 154 boxes in Mansfield.  Since I had many of the Mansfield boxes already, I didn't do as many full time boxes during that month.  My highest count was 32 in one day, which was in Pomfret.<br/>
