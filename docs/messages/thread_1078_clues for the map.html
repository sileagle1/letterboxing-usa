 Am I doing something wrong?  I have boxes that have not made the map: 1 at Washington Monument (on the AT trail)(Civil War) near Boonsboro, Md; 2 at Antietam(Civil War), Sharpsburg, MD, 2 at Huntley Meadows, Alexandria, VA, 2 at Yankauer Nature Preserve, Shepardstown WV and 2 at Greenbelt Regional Park,Greenbelt, MD.<br/>
 Thanks for placing the Devil's Racecourse on the AT list. I had forgotten that it was on that trail as well.<br/>
<br/>
 Am I submitting them to the worng place by putting them on the talk list?<br/>

 Thanks,<br/>

No, you're not! We've been a little backed up with the changeover to <br/>
letterboxing.org. Please don't be discouraged with us: the MANY new <br/>
boxes on the east coast, both mid-atlantic and the northeast, will be <br/>
updated onto the map soon. John and Tom are both on it, and I'm 90% <br/>
there on the learning curve. I know how fun it is to see your links <br/>
get on-line quickly, and am sure that this little delay will be a <br/>
temporary one. Keep 'em coming!!! I think the best place to post them <br/>
first is to the talk list: it gives every one a chance to see them in <br/>
one central location and it also serves as a bit of a backup. We hope <br/>
to have a "what's new" page up on LBNA soon, which would give you a <br/>
second place to see new boxes easily as well. So don't worry, <br/>
Squirrel! Things'll be back to normal in the next week or two.<br/>
