Oxen Series<br/>
Mansfield Center, Ct.  Tolland County<br/>

Rated easy : unless you have oxen with you ( we left ours home )<br/>
<br/>
   We found ourselves just one days journey from the homeplace . The <br/>
sun was shining on us we would push on. We began this day in <br/>
Mansfield Center , the village once known as Ponde Place and the land <br/>
of the people of Uncas. A place of history even this day as we <br/>
recreate the journey of our ancestors. It is June 2002 a 300 th  <br/>
celebration  in full swing. We have come 20 miles with the teams of <br/>
oxen striding beside us. This morning a pause on the lawn of the <br/>
First Church of Christ Congreagational . The church Boaz attended in <br/>
1772 and we attend today. <br/>
   Now if you are searching for a marker in history you might be <br/>
ambitious and leave your car here and walk as we and the oxen did. If <br/>
less ambitious or you have children in tow then drive up the Browns <br/>
Rd. hill from the church . Watching the stone wall on your left  you <br/>
might view a date where the Dewing family signed their craftsmanship. <br/>
But that will be another box. Keep going there is room for  just one <br/>
car barely at the Babcock Trail just after a  blue ranch. Park right <br/>
by the phone pole. Or  if a car  there already you can backtrack to <br/>
the Holt trail parking or go on to Wolf Rock parking. If you reach <br/>
the  Y in the road you have gone to far! <br/>
    The oxen barely needed rest after 20 miles they still walk on <br/>
with vigor. We might have stopped here for a breather if they needed <br/>
one. Take the Babcock trail down into the shaded wood. This was not <br/>
always so. Where there are walls there was farm land. Connecticut was <br/>
stripped of trees by the 1800's. Imagine long ago cows grazing here <br/>
or a Mulberry orchard as they were the feed of silk worms an <br/>
important cottage industry in early Mansfield.  Now think  when this <br/>
land was deeded from the natives by Joshua son of great cheif Uncas <br/>
it was wooded. Settlers to these parts needed to build houses , and <br/>
barns, and roads and bridges. OXEN ,they cleared the land and hauled <br/>
the trees  for building. <br/>
   Walk down the trail until you see a tree growing V shaped-<br/>
<br/>
Now that they had a place to live they needed farms to support them <br/>
OXEN cleared the stumps. They made them into fences and sometimes <br/>
burned them. <br/>
    Walk down the trail to an old rotten stump <br/>
<br/>
New England a picturesque place with stone walls - well  next our <br/>
colonial ancestors needed crops planted and the OXEN  tilled the <br/>
soil. Well for many years tilling the soil was a slow process as they <br/>
had to remove the stones in the way. So the OXEN dragged them away <br/>
and the great   maze of New England walls rose from the  fresh turned <br/>
soil. <br/>
      Cross some seasonal stream beds full of those New England rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Think of the miles walked to make a farm only to arrive and have all <br/>
the work  of clearing, building and walls to lay before you. The <br/>
hardy folks who lived here long ago worked hard every day to make  a <br/>
place to raise their family.  Then came the bill for taxes, the <br/>
community grows and so does its needs. The  OXEN were taken out to <br/>
work off the debt of taxes by helping build the roads. <br/>
     Walk to a place where the  path crosses a small stone wall. A <br/>
stone wall OXEN probably built while clearing the land.  Look to the <br/>
right where a tree has fallen. Under the fork of the tree in the  <br/>
space below is the Stone  Stump and Soil letterbox.<br/>
     Return up the hill to your car and marvel at how fast you travel <br/>
away. We did  1 mph  with our oxen!<br/>
