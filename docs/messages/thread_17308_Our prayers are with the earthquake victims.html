California - hope all our fellow letterboxers out there are ok.  Our <br/>
prayers go out on behalf of all the folks out there - especially <br/>
those who have lost loved ones.  It would be horrible anytime but a <br/>
couple of days before Christmas just seems worse somehow.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am pretty far south of the epicenter (about 200 miles) but we felt it here.  So far, the reports are 2 or 3 deaths (depending on where you get your news).  <br/>
<br/>
The only bright spot is that the quake happened in a relatively low population area.  It would have been far worse if is had been in LA or the Bay Area.<br/>
