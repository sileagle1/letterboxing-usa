<div>Today<em> </em>I stopped by the Smokey Point Rest 
Area on  I-5, the first Rest Area north of Marysville (which is just north 
of Everett).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Located the "Candle In The Wind:" letterbox on my first 
try.  It was right behind the first Thuja I found, by the fence.  
Guess you have to think like a Gardening Goose hiding a Canadian Secret 
:-)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Considered that it might have been already replaced, but 
the original log book was there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Road Trippin is doing great.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One comment was that it was easy to be seen snagging the 
box.  How true!  Both are behind a few (as in very few) trees with no 
brush, in a fairly busy rest stop.  Take care when you get 
them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The boxes are well hidden, but in the dog area.  I 
added some "About Letterboxing" sheets to each one, in case they are found by 
others.</div>
