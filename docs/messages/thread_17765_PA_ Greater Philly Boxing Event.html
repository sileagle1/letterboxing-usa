                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
I am still planning to hold this event.<br/>
I have had great support from Silent Doug and good advice from several<br/>
others.<br/>
We do expect this to be a pot luck day, so send Doug or me a note on what<br/>
you plan to bring.<br/>
<br/>
With all the bad weather we have been having in the area, I was concerned I<br/>
would even get out to place the event boxes.<br/>
Fear not.  I made it today.  I did fall flat on my back within the first 10<br/>
feet of hiking.  But I was much more careful after that.<br/>
So, there will be plenty of boxing available from this starting point.<br/>
I will have clue sets printed for these four event boxes as well as the<br/>
existing Green Lane Park boxes (3) and Perkiomen Trail set (6).<br/>
<br/>
Hope the weather improves.  But we'll have fun no matter what.<br/>
See you soon.<br/>
<br/>
