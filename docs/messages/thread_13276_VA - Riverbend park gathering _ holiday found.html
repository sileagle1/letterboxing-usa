&gt; Special thanks to Mary and Firefly for carving the event stamps.  <br/>
Who<br/>
&gt; did the other event stamp?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; To anyone who went after the treasure map and letterboxing final <br/>
exam,<br/>
&gt; I hope the clues wern't too hard.  I'll post these boxes to the web<br/>
&gt; site soon if you missed them.<br/>

It was wonderful to meet so many folks at the park. I am glad the <br/>
rain and wind held off enough for all to have a good time. <br/>
Thank you to Mother of Crickets for making the arrangements, To Mary <br/>
and Firefly for the event stamps, ( I did the 'blue' one ), to Rich <br/>
for planting a box just for the occassion, ( I did not get to go look <br/>
for it but I will be back), and all those who came to share stories <br/>
and stamps from CT, MD, RI, VA, and beyond! <br/>
<br/>
Also, I went to Pentagon City later that day to introduce some more <br/>
folks to our wonderful hobby. It's a Holiday-Hopping into Spring is <br/>
in wonderful shape, very few stamps, but doing well.<br/>
<br/>
Til we meet on the trail, Happy hunting! <br/>
