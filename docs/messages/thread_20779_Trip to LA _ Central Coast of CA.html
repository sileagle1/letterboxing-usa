Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I've already posted this on the Southern CA board and received some <br/>
good input from Q &amp; Don.  I thought I'd also post on the "big board" <br/>
to get more feedback.  <br/>
<br/>
We'll be in California from NOV 6-14 to visit some wineries, do some <br/>
hiking and look for letterboxes. We'll be flying into Los Angeles and <br/>
tentatively plan to head north along the Central Coast, including the <br/>
San Luis Obispo area and north to the Cambria and Paso Robles area. <br/>
Based on our preliminary look at LB clues, we'll probably also spend <br/>
some time in the Ventura area and Pasadena/Altadena area because they <br/>
have some "difficult" or "strenuous" hikes that also have a LB.  <br/>
We're interested in any suggestions from locals re: good hikes, <br/>
interesting wineries and your favorite restaurants.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in getting together for an informal exchange <br/>
over a cup of coffe or glass of wine, let us know.<br/>
<br/>
You can contact me off-list at kotlarek at wi.rr.com<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
