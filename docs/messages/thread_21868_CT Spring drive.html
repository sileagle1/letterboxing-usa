                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you MayEve and Wild Rover for a great time. I'm sorry that I was only  <br/>
able to get the first set of boxes for the day but I had to get up to my <br/>
Mom's.  She was very understanding about wanting to at least take part in some of <br/>
the  Spring Drive.<br/>
<br/>
Having looked at the pictures on Mark and Sue's web site I'm sorry that I  <br/>
missed the rest the day. This is the second time that I've missed gathering at  <br/>
RTRW's house. It would have been fun to hang out somemore with such a great  <br/>
group of people. I hope to make it to tomorrows May Day gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Having (partially) been to one of the drives I hope to attend more of them  <br/>
in the future.  Thanks again, you really got my day off to a great  start.<br/>
<br/>
