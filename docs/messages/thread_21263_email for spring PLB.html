Hi, <br/>
If you signed up for the spring postal letterbox could you please <br/>
private message me with your e-mail. As I got the mail I deleted <br/>
messages and have no idea which email goes with which person. My <br/>
plan is to e-mail each person when it is time to send it to the next <br/>
person to make sure you still want it. This way we can keep it <br/>
moving. Obviously this is my first box. I am so organized. :-) This <br/>
would be a big help. Please email me your address and name. We as of <br/>
now have 49 names on the list.<br/>

I believe there is a separate Yahoo! Group specifically for Postal <br/>
Boxes.  Please do not clutter up this list with posts regarding <br/>
postal boxes.  Thanks!<br/>
