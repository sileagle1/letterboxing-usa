Personal correspondence between Samuel Bellamy and Thomas Tew<br/>

Thom,<br/>
<br/>
It is good to knew that you are still alive.  Heard rumors that you had been lynched by the Kings men.  I knew of the Place you speak.  I heard Tales of other Pirates stashing their loot in the area.  Maybe we can search the area to be rewarded with hidden Treasure.  I will meet you there next month on the day when the Moon is in its first quarter, an hour before Noon.  I will bring Sugar from the West Indies and other Delicacies to share with you.  It will be good to see you again, olde Friend.<br/>

However, if mayhap we meet, and ye has yourself in a <br/>

quarrel with me, mayhap I would grace Grace with a <br/>
song....<br/>
<br/>
Now in sailor's clothes Granuaile did go<br/>
A bold sea captain from top to toe<br/>
Her clans and children were the greatest care<br/>
Of Grace O'Malley, of Grace O'Malley<br/>
Who never did despair<br/>
<br/>
Her trade was maintainence by land and sea<br/>
Two hundred loyal men were her army<br/>
No other captain was as skilled or brave<br/>
As Grace O'Malley, as Grace O'Malley<br/>
Who ruled the stormy wave<br/>
<br/>
Now they had not sailed far from Clew Bay<br/>
When she spied a vessel bound for Galway<br/>
"Those are sea merchants," Grania did cry<br/>
"And Granuaile, and Granuaile<br/>
Will stop that ship or die"<br/>
<br/>
She stopped that ship, and they took its store<br/>
She returned to Old Erin's shore<br/>
With Spanish brandy she walked along<br/>
Did Granuaile, did Granuaile<br/>
Who sweetly sang a song<br/>
<br/>
Now Queen Elizabeth did once suggest<br/>
That she would name Grace a countess<br/>
"Oh no," says Grace, "That would never do<br/>
For Grace O'Malley, for Grace O'Malley<br/>
Is as great a queen as you"<br/>
<br/>
The Queen of Connaught by land and sea<br/>
Her strength commanded fierce loyalty<br/>
Her wealth provided for many's the clans<br/>
Of Grace O'Malley, of Grace O'Malley<br/>
Seawoman of Ireland<br/>

Grace is no he<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Aye, ye have proven ye know a bit about yer Cap'n in <br/>
these waters.  Tis good!"<br/>
<br/>
Knowledge of her I have indeed, but it is a bit <br/>
presumptious to be assuming she is my Captian.......... I <br/>
have no need for a captain, as I am one in my own right<br/>

My dearest brother,<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned for the safety of my husband, Thom.  I fear that he is taking unsafe measures in meeting other former privateers in a few days.  I beseech you, please, go and protect him and make sure the Royal Guards to not capture him.  The new governor would like nothing more than to hang him as an example for others like him.  Contact me if you need to know where and when he will be meeting those scoundrels.<br/>

Your loving sister,<br/>
Elsbeth<br/>
