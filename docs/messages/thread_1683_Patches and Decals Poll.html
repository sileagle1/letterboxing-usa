After checking with "Mohmers", it appears that the<br/>

for.<br/>
<br/>
I am starting a "poll" to see who else wants patches.<br/>
I suspect that interest may be high enough to get<br/>
another bulk order together. I don't know the minimum<br/>
requirements or costs involved as this is Mohmers'<br/>
territory.<br/>

Remember, this is JUST A SURVEY (with NO obligation)<br/>

please go to:<br/>
http://www.egroups.com/group/letterbox-usa and click<br/>
on POLLS on the left side of the page.<br/>
<br/>
I will keep the poll open for at least 8 to 10 weeks<br/>
and publish the results around mid-March.<br/>

we had a letterboxing patch to purchase. I know I would buy at least four of<br/>
them, probably more since I'm starting to get more people in the Wild, Wild<br/>
West interested in letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
I've only been at this since November and I've already placed six<br/>
letterboxes and plan to place a couple in Southern Oregon when I visit down<br/>
there within the next couple weeks.  My cousin and her boyfriend are going<br/>
with me and we may be able to get my little cousin, Brittany interested.  I<br/>
really enjoy finding the letterboxes (when I'm smart enough to figure out<br/>
the clues) and I've discovered it would be really, really, really helpful if<br/>
I learned how to read a compass!  That's on my to do list!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mohmers has provided me with some clarification regarding patch <br/>
ordering, so I will pass it along:<br/>
<br/>
We need to accrue a minimum order of 50 patches ALL of the SAME TYPE. <br/>
In other words, they all have to be LbNA Logo patches or all P50 or <br/>
all F25, etc.<br/>
<br/>
At this time, the poll is referring to LbNA "logo" patches only. I <br/>
think at this early stage of the game, the "planted and found" number <br/>
patches may be in less demand. (But not by next fall, I'm sure!!)<br/>
<br/>
I cannot edit the poll now or the current responses will be lost...so <br/>
again, the understanding is that these are for logo patches. The poll <br/>
is only a few hours old and already we're up to at least 16 patches!<br/>
<br/>
I would be so happy to pass by someone on the trail sporting that <br/>
patch on thier backpack!<br/>
