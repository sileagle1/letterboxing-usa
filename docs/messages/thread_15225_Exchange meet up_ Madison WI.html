drive it might be and don't know if I'll make it all the way to Madison by<br/>
8pm. I might have to stop for the night prior to Madison. If anyone is<br/>
interested in joining us, I'll try to get some contact info (phone) for<br/>
Rexie, so I can contact her while I'm on the road and she can let you know<br/>
if I can make it. Or I can have my hubby post to her. Otherwise, you'll have<br/>
to just gather amongst yourselves :-)<br/>

&gt; Subject: Exchange meet-up: Madison WI...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If anyone on this list is in Wisconsin, a couple of people traveling<br/>
&gt; through here and myself (in Madison) are meeting at Borders (Cafe')<br/>
&gt; east in Madison off Zier rd and  HWY 151 to exchange stamp images<br/>
&gt; (Stamp in each others log books).  We are looking at a date of this<br/>
&gt; Friday around 8PM or Saterday Morning.  Anyone interested can email<br/>
&gt; me at rexenne(at)chartermi(dot)net, for directions and updates as<br/>
&gt; they happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many Blessings!<br/>
