<br/>
New on the list, and wanted to post about my first event! I'll be hosting a Boxers gathering at the Springfield City Library Community room on Aug 27, 2011 from 10-4 to benefit the students in Springfield who have lost their school to the recent tornadoes. A lot of these kids have also lost their homes, and we'd like to be able to help them out.<br/>
<br/>
It's a potluck, and we're also welcoming folks to bring school supplies that will be donated to Brookings and other area schools. (Notebooks, pencils, etc). There will be a raffle as well- proceeds will go to Springfield Forward who will then buy more supplies and donate everything to the local schools they've been working with since the storm.<br/>
<br/>
Event details are on atlas quest here: http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=2171.<br/>
<br/>
This is the very first gathering I've ever put together and I've got some amazing people helping me. I'm open to any suggestions, so if you'd like please go right ahead and contact me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening! I hope to see some of you there!<br/>
<br/>
