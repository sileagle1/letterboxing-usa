Near: Cedarville, Greene County, Ohio<br/>
Difficulty: 2 (1 mile hike on trails)<br/>
Placed 4 December 2001 by Flyfisher<br/>
<br/>
The Adena civilization in the Ohio Valley existed sometime between <br/>
4000 BC and 500 AD.  Nothing is known from the historical record of <br/>
this civilization.  No written documents await deciphering.  "Burial <br/>
mounds" and "fortifications" abound with several theories as to their <br/>
use and purpose.  The woodland Indian nations that occupied this area <br/>
when east coast european hunters arrived knew nothing of the builders <br/>
of the ancient mounds and fort like enclosures scattered around the <br/>
valley.  <br/>
<br/>
A typical day in the life of a young man may have gone something like <br/>
this: Rising in the morning with a crew of fellow hunters, armed with <br/>
pointed spears, the party walks several miles through the beech and <br/>
oak forests.  At a spring with yellow sulpher crystallized at its <br/>
edges, the hunters surround a full-grown bull moose.  A 14 year old <br/>
son of the tribal head man lunges at the moose with his 8 foot long <br/>
pole, pushing the stick into the root of the moose's neck, but the <br/>
moose turns and charges the youth.  Trampled, the young man does not <br/>
rise from the muddy ground.  <br/>
<br/>
Our 18-year-old hunter and the rest of the party surround the <br/>
weakening beast and wear it down, finally getting it to the ground an <br/>
hour later.  The hunters break out their hand shaped flint knives and <br/>
begin the gruesome task of skinning the animal and reducing the <br/>
carcass into pieces that can be carried by a man on the 6-mile <br/>
journey home.  <br/>
<br/>
The 13 year old, whose neck was snapped by the moose lapses into a <br/>
coma and then stops breathing.  Such hunting accidents make the hunt <br/>
both dangerous and heroic.  This son's daring will be spoken of for <br/>
many years to come.  <br/>
<br/>
Back at the village, the head man has already heard the sad news.  <br/>
All members of the tribe have stopped their daily work and begun to <br/>
carry woven purses of clay and water from the creek to the nearby <br/>
burial mound.  Soon the surface of the ancient mound is slick from <br/>
the application of the fresh coat of dirt and water.  Only a single <br/>
strip remains from the bottom to the top where the workers have <br/>
carried their loads to the top before releasing them down the sides <br/>
of mound.  <br/>
<br/>
The burial crypt has been prepared, and the next day, the honored son <br/>
is laid to rest, with suitable remarks, immersed in thick soupy clay, <br/>
in the same fetal position he was born.  More dirt and water is added <br/>
to the mound as the village folk go about their never ending need to <br/>
work, play, eat, and grow.   Tomorrow a new hunting party will go a <br/>
field to look for game.  <br/>
<br/>
Note:  (Nothing is actually known of the mound you will visit.  Some <br/>
mounds have been found to be places of funerary activities, others <br/>
have not contained graves.  This mound has never been excavated.)  As <br/>
you approach this possible gravesite, do so with the same reverence <br/>
you would any other hallowed ground.  <br/>
To wit, south of Cedarville on US 42 is a park called Indian Mound <br/>
Preserve.  It has 3 parking lots along Route 42.  Park in the middle <br/>
lot.  It may help to find this lot if you use a GPS receiver or print <br/>
a topographic map centered on N 39.7377 W 83.8287.  <br/>
<br/>
Leave the parking lot, walking on a road at 335 degrees.  From the <br/>
far side of the bridge, 53 paces later (1 pace = 2 steps, about 5 <br/>
feet) bear right (40 degrees) onto a trail.  Follow this trail, and <br/>
at the fork with the wooden bridge, bear left up the rocky path to <br/>
the mound.  <br/>
<br/>
Climb the mound via the steps.  You did count the steps didn't you?  <br/>
Good!  Take a bearing of exactly the number of steps up the mound.  <br/>
Now turn right around and look at what pilots call the back course.  <br/>
There is a large standing tree in that direction and another large <br/>
tree lying on the ground at it's foot.   This is visible in the <br/>
winter  summer may take a bit more imagination.<br/>
<br/>
Descend the steps and walk around the mound toward that tree.  When <br/>
closest to the tree, take 10 paces toward the tree from the edge of <br/>
the mown grass.  Arriving at the nearest part of the fallen tree, sit <br/>
down.  You have arrived.  On the far side of the fallen tree, under 3 <br/>
rocks, is the Mound letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
After stamping up, I would ask you to read this whole description <br/>
again from your resting point.  Make up another story about how this <br/>
mound came to be when what we call the Adena civilization was at its <br/>
height.  Your idea is likely to bear as much weight as mine, and <br/>
likely as much weight at that of professional archeologists.   The <br/>
simple truth is, we don't have the foggiest idea what happened here.  <br/>
<br/>
Want to know the real truth? As the "Dread Pirate Roberts" <br/>
said:  "Get used to disappointment."    <br/>
