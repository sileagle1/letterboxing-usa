                    <div class="plaintext-content">These 3 boxes made for a nice break in the drive home from NY <br/>
yesterday.  Left NY in a cold, early morning rain and couldn't resist <br/>
the sun and warm as I headed south.  Locust Shade 1 &amp; 2 are along a <br/>
pleasant trail and I found both tucked safely in their spots.  Both <br/>
had been visited twice before me and it was great to see the Drew <br/>
Clan stamps in Virginia!<br/>
<br/>
Woodland Alarm was a little more challenging (missed the lover's tree <br/>
on the first loop) and wondered how I could have on the second trip <br/>
around.  Scrambled down the wrong (and steeper) slope first...ignored <br/>
the compass and headed for an oversized slingshot I was sure was the <br/>
one.  Came to my senses and relied on the compass readings and found <br/>
the right spot. Interestingly enough, the pile of logs seemed intact <br/>
and undisturbed, but the letterbox was set beside the tree on the <br/>
ground out in the open.  I was the first to stamp in here and <br/>
replaced the box under the logs and added another pretty heavy one <br/>
for good measure.  Being one who usually ignores the obvious and <br/>
looks for the hidden, I must admit I left not knowing what <br/>
the "alarm" is.<br/>
<br/>
Jay, the stamps are great additions to my log.  Thanks for another <br/>
introduction to a great spot not too far from home.<br/>

They certainly did yesterday...I heard them loud and clear and <br/>
wondered if that might be the "alarm".  Perhaps their squawking <br/>
scared away the one who removed the letterbox and didn't replace it <br/>
beneath the log pile????<br/>
