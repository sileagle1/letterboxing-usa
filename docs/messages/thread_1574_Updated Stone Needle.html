<br/>
Stone Needle in New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
In the state I am in, how high can you go?<br/>
The answer to that question Mr. Kuser did know.<br/>
<br/>
He knew it quite well, but now he is gone.<br/>
And in the stone needle the answer lives on.<br/>
<br/>
For the ultimate sacrifice it points to the sky.<br/>
So show some reverence as you draw nigh.<br/>
<br/>
So find the stone needle and stand way below.<br/>
Where you pay to see far is the first place you should go.<br/>
<br/>
Stand between those devices and admire the view.<br/>
You'll know you're all right if the stone needle is 219 true.<br/>
<br/>
Now to the Needle take those devices and point them.<br/>
Add the numbers on their dials to 267 to go then.<br/>
<br/>
Walk thirty-eight paces crossing drive and guide rail.<br/>
To a tree white as snow on the course of a trail.<br/>
<br/>
Now thirty-seven is the way you should face.<br/>
And 109 double steps is the length you should pace.<br/>
<br/>
You'll come to a place where you can't travel by wheel.<br/>
And look for the entry of the very same trail.<br/>
<br/>
There standing before you is a pipe colored white.<br/>
