Today I went to look for a box along a lovely stream that had signs <br/>
everywhere (the way I came, which was opposite {of course} from the <br/>
orientation of the clue)  that said please pretty please with sugar <br/>
on top, don't go off the trail, restoration in progress.  Also <br/>
included in the clue was specifics, but how anal should one be for <br/>
these specifics?  I was given two designated points that equaled a <br/>
precise number of steps to the planter.  Then an additional number of <br/>
steps.  Wondering whether I should come back with a measuring tool <br/>
and do the math, I ended up with a choice of three spots to look.  <br/>
None had any obvious matches to the clue, with out going off the <br/>
trail onto hallowed ground.  So, was I to conclude the box wasn't <br/>
there anymore?  Or that the planters weren't so concerned with the <br/>
restoration project underway?  I did venture off the trail once and <br/>
felt exceedingly guilty.  <br/>
<br/>
Because I am so new, I don't know what to make of my boxing ability.  <br/>
I have looked for 12 boxes and found 7.  Am I only finding the easy <br/>
boxes?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone from the Portland Oregon area would not find this list <br/>
too subjective:<br/>
<br/>
Found  1) Mt. Tabor   2)  Rocky Butte  3)  Sea Farer's Friend, <br/>
Bandon   4)  Coquille River Lighthouse  5)  Humbug/ old 101  6)  <br/>
Wahkeena Falls  7)  Fairy Falls<br/>
<br/>
Looked but didn't find    1)  Horsetail Falls  2)  Ponytail Falls  <br/>
3)  Powell Butte   4)  Cape Blanco  5)  Mystery Box<br/>
<br/>
I am old enough to know that often I take things too literally, but <br/>
not wise enough to know when I am doing it.  Any thoughts?  Will I <br/>
have to become less timid to find more boxes?  I'm not ever going to <br/>
try the extreme 1 box no matter what anybody says.  :)<br/>
