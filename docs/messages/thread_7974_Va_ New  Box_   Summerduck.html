I was driving out to check on "Bamboo Gone Wild" and realized it was <br/>
quite a drive...thought I'd stick another box in.<br/>
Not being very imaginative that day... I called it..<br/>
NAME: Big Dead Tree<br/>
LOCATION: Summerduck, Va.<br/>
DIRECTIONS:<br/>
This box is located in the C.F.Phelps Wildlife Management Area just <br/>
past Summerduck, Va.<br/>
 Take the FALMOUTH/WARRENTON exit off of Interstate 95 and follow the <br/>
signs for WARRENTON (Rt. 17 North). After about 10 miles of driving, <br/>
you'll cross the Stafford/Faquier County line. Drive about two more <br/>
miles then start watching for the signs for Sumerduck (Rt 651).Turn <br/>
left onto Rt. 651 and head towards Sumerduck.<br/>
Drive about 5 miles then start looking on the LEFT for the entrance <br/>
to the area (Easy to see since it's flanked by two fairly large white <br/>
brick structures).<br/>
Pull in through the gate and drive...and drive..and drive...(it's a <br/>
gravel road and it takes a bit of paitence to get there). Follow the <br/>
signs that lead you to the parking area for the fishing pond. Park <br/>
your car in the parking area and head across the field down to the <br/>
pond. When you get to the pond, turn RIGHT and follow the edge of the <br/>
pond until you hit a gravel service road. Notice along the way the <br/>
beaver gnawed trees...these guys were ambitous!! The walk along the <br/>
pond is weedy but easy.<br/>
Once you get to the service road, turn LEFT and follow the service <br/>
road around the end of the pond. About the time you get to the place <br/>
where the road goes away from the pond you'll see the back of a <br/>
triangular safety sign (Indicating where hunting is not allowed).<br/>
