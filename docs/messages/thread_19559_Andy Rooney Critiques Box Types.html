                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do a fairly good imitation of Andy Rooney on 60 minutes.  You know <br/>
how he will discourse in all seriousness about something as mundane <br/>
as the frustrations of coat hangers?  The following should be read <br/>
with his voice and attitude in mind.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever been frustrated by some of all the different kinds of <br/>
letterbox containers out there?  There is nothing so satisfying as <br/>
finding a good, blue rimmed, freezer style Rubbermaid container, <br/>
with its snug and dry treasure inside.   I like how sturdy they <br/>
feel.  But there are a lot of other containers out there that just <br/>
aren't up to snuff.  <br/>
<br/>
You set out containers and feel so proud of the nice new box, with <br/>
sealed bags and your art inside.  I know I have.  Then a year later <br/>
you discover it cracked, ripped and damp.  You persevere and try <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
You know those disposable containers they sell many to a pack?  How <br/>
many times have you found them cracked with the lid hanging off?  <br/>
And then the kind whose plastic gets warped, or the edge chipped.  <br/>
You can never get them closed.  You repackage them with new ziplocs <br/>
from your repair kit... and pray for them.<br/>
<br/>
I also get frustrated when the box is smaller than the contents.  It <br/>
seems like a perfectly good container until you try to put the log <br/>
back in.  You have to force and bend it to get it in there.  You <br/>
never know if the seal is going to hold.  I bet that you too have <br/>
found that it helps to put the stamp on the bottom and the log on <br/>
top.  The box is a little wider up there.  <br/>
<br/>
Just last night I found a new box with a really terrific stamp, <br/>
nicely mounted on thick wood.  But it was stuffed in a box that was <br/>
way too shallow for it.  It was very wide but not deep enough. I had <br/>
to force the edges down like my over stuffed suitcase.  I knew it <br/>
wouldn't hold.  The lid was popped and barely on at all when I found <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many different types of baggies.  There's the thin <br/>
sandwich kind, that too many people use; the zippered kind, that <br/>
seem handy; and the heavier freezer bags with labels.<br/>
<br/>
I have come to dread those thin, sandwich baggies.  They seem <br/>
alright when you plant them.  But if you are the 30th finder they <br/>
show their age.  It's bad enough when you find them ripped but don't <br/>
you feel really guilty when "you" rip them trying to get them open?  <br/>
And then you already used your repair supply on the first two in the <br/>
series?<br/>
<br/>
The pull tab, zipper kind seem handy but I have found so many with <br/>
the tabs broken and missing, and the seal half open.  They just <br/>
don't hold up through a season.<br/>
<br/>
I once found a log all wound up in a one of those long newspaper <br/>
bags.  You know the ones the paperboy slides your rolled newspaper <br/>
in on rainy days.  Whoever wrapped it (undoubtably not the placer) <br/>
must have thought that a number of wraps around would keep it dry.  <br/>
The water disagreed.  It was the soaked.<br/>
<br/>
It's so sad and disheartening to find a beautiful log that's turned <br/>
into stamp ink soup.<br/>
<br/>
I really like the heavier, freezer style ziplocs.  They are little <br/>
harder to fold and fit into the container but I think they are <br/>
really worth it.  I bet you too, fold the corners underneath so they <br/>
don't get in the seal.  They even have a surface to write on so you <br/>
can label them: Log1, Log2, Stamp, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
The labels really help me because between the kids, the guest, the <br/>
dog and my over cluttered mind I get easily confused as to what came <br/>
out of what.  How many times have you said, "Oh, this must be for <br/>
the stamp because there's ink in it"?  <br/>
<br/>
I'm intrigued by the idea of putting those dessicant bags inside.  I <br/>
wonder how long they last.  As long as I don't have to start writing <br/>
on my stamps, "Do Not Eat".<br/>
<br/>
Did you notice the white plastic bag on the ground in the Time <br/>
magazine article?  I bet they lay out the contents on that bag in a <br/>
certain way to keep track of everything.  That or the photographer <br/>
thought it would look good.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I enjoy the blue Rubbermaids it is always fun to find a <br/>
different and clever container.  I've seen and heard of so many <br/>
different kinds: film cannisters, cigar tubes, mint tins, bottles, <br/>
milk jugs, gerbil coffins.  <br/>
<br/>
We always like to joke about how we are out hunting tupperware.  But <br/>
have you ever found a real Tupperware container out there?<br/>
<br/>
For all this I don't care what I find out there.  I repair when I <br/>
can, dry things out, and rebag.  I know not everyone can afford <br/>
freezer containers.  I have several boxes I've planted with not as <br/>
good boxes and bags, before I decided to use different stuff.  Isn't <br/>
the important thing to have something to find and get out there?  <br/>
<br/>
I am just delighted whenever I find the treasure of a usable stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting out there.<br/>
