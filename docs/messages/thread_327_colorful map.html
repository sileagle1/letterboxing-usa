&gt; While we are talking about revising our home page and logo, I will <br/>
&gt;  add that I liked your alternative map very much, Mitch - the one you <br/>
&gt;  put up a number of months ago at Kid's Corner. You used to access it <br/>
&gt;  by clicking Piglet, but it seems that link is gone. Anyway, as some <br/>
&gt;  folks will remember, it was a larger map with lots of nice colors....<br/>
<br/>
Tom,<br/>
Thanks for your comments regarding the logos, and for mentioning the colorful<br/>
map.  I haven't thrown it out yet, and since you mentioned it, I'll go ahead<br/>
and re-post it.  This time, I'll make it so you click on Owl to get there,<br/>
since Owl knows much more about maps than Pigglet.  Or, just go to<br/>
www.pclink.com/elf/kidsusa.htm<br/>
<br/>
Many people had expressed support for the maps we are currently using, and I'm<br/>
sort of thinking this alternate map might come in handy if we should decide at<br/>
some point to keep track of the clues that are appropriate for kids.  As a<br/>
feature for Kids Corner, we could make up a list of the kid-friendly boxes and<br/>
have that list accessible by clicking on a state from the big, colorful map.<br/>
Comments, anyone??<br/>
<br/>

Great idea Mitch!!  Ultimately, a seperate map linking to kid-appropriate maps makes a lot of sense.<br/>
<br/>
I was just browsing the Kid's page section.  How long has that story been there?  Very nice!<br/>
<br/>
Actually, that leads me to a question I've been meaning to ask for a while.  Once in a while Mitch or Dan'l will reference in a message a page on the website that I hadn't found throught the site.  The only example I can think of right now is the input form for clues.  Are there many more pages on the site that aren't linked to the home page?  Would it make sense to have a "site map" page?<br/>
<br/>
Back to the kid's corner...  I found one minor thing I'm not totally confortable with (Don't take this personally Mitch; probably an oversight).  When clicking on Piglet (I think) which links to examples of stamps, there is one stamp on the 1st image that I'd rather little ones not try to carve themselves, or see for that matter.  No a real big issue, but some parents might be offended. (When my 8-yr old saw the image  he asked: "Why do they have a belly dancer on there?"  His favorite restaurant is a Moroccan restaurant)<br/>
<br/>
My $.02<br/>
<br/>
JDW<br/>
I'm having an identity crisis:  was "Der Wolf", now thinking about "Wolfman".  Decisions, decisions...<br/>

No problem, Mitch.  Current and future fans of Letterboxing are very lucky to have people like you, Dan'l(, et al) putting in the energy you do to make this thing fly.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.  It's far from complete, but I thought I'd go ahead and post it for<br/>
comments.  Careful, I'm not a writer by trade and my feelings are easily<br/>
hurt!!  (ha!)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Actually, that leads me to a question I've been meaning to ask for a while.<br/>

&gt; site that aren't linked to the home page?  Would it make sense to have a "<br/>
&gt; site map" page?<br/>
<br/>
Such unlisted pages (of which I think the input form is the only one still out<br/>
there) are usually just something that is not ready for publication, only for<br/>
group comment.  That's why the link to it only appears on this group list.<br/>
Obviously, I've had several such hidden pages until recently, when I posted<br/>
the story.<br/>
<br/>
