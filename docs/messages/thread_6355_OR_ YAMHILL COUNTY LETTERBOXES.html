days and we found three letterboxes while out that way!<br/>
<br/>
The Spruce Goose, recently placed by Annette is alive and well at Galen<br/>
McBee Airport Park.  This is a swell little park, kind of reminds me of<br/>
Riccarton Bush in New Zealand somewhat. The clues to this box were IDEAL<br/>
and the stamp is adorable!<br/>
<br/>
Bald Peak State Park placed by Funhog was a great find.  Clever, clever<br/>
girl with those clues, Karen!  And the stamp is quite humorous!<br/>
<br/>
Bald Peak State Park placed by the Bendicksons was VERY REWARDING.  We<br/>
were on the wrong trail at first, but eventually backtracked and found<br/>
the "cornerstone" and then were on the right path.  This stamp(s) is<br/>
absolutely beautiful and the hiding place is fantastic.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for a wonderful Saturday of letterboxing.  Anyone who<br/>
visits Oregon's wine country should definitely add finding these<br/>
letterboxes to their list of adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
