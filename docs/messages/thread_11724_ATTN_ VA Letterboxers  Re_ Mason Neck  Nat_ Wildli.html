                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not being familiar with this specific box and its location, I am a <br/>
little confused.  Are they saying that there can be no letterboxes in <br/>
the refuge, period?  Or is there a problem with this and any other <br/>
boxes along this particular trail, which appears to be in a "closed <br/>
area?"  They seem to be concerned that people were entering a closed <br/>
area, but then request that any and all boxes be removed from the <br/>
refuge. <br/>
<br/>
Just what is a "closed area" in a wildlife refuge?  Why would there <br/>
have been a letterbox in an area that was off-limits to the public?  <br/>
Or do they close certain areas at certain times of the year to allow <br/>
for breeding, etc., so an area may be open at one time and closed at <br/>
another?<br/>
