Gosh, I've been a part of letterboxing for over 4 years now and we've only
found 5.   I guess I'm not really a veteran...just a long-time
newbie.  Shameful, that.
</p><p>Can I confess and tell you all that one of the reasons we haven't found
more is that I can't stand being eaten alive by bugs?  Seriously,
the other times we've gone looking I've come out with welts all over my
legs and arms and other body parts even though I always wear bug stuff
while the bugs don't even look twice at my husband.  Anyone else having
this problem?
