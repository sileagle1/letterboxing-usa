I wanted to share my reply with everyone concerning this type of stamp.....<br/>
<br/>
First and foremost, I am a disabled Veteran myself.  Given the recent rash<br/>
of 'less than honorable' people that have attempted to create completely<br/>
false military records for whatever reason in real life (Not referring to<br/>
anyone on this list), I can assure you and everyone on this list that I am<br/>
distrustful by nature when someone claims to have had something happen<br/>
without independent verification... Seems like my military training has<br/>
stuck around....<br/>
<br/>
Please understand that the thought of creating a 'Medal of Honor' stamp for<br/>
letterboxer's was never intended, not in my mind, to even slightly resemble<br/>
the actual MOH in any manner.<br/>
<br/>
I mean no disrespect when I say that I would hesitate to send a stamp to<br/>
someone just because they said they did something.  But then again, I've<br/>
been called a bit of an strong minded, opinionated old codger from time to<br/>
time... (Grin)<br/>
<br/>
I'm well aware that Letterboxing is a hobby and in no manner resembles the<br/>
situations where a real MOH was awarded. For anyone to think otherwise<br/>
indicates the apparent lack of cognitive reasoning and common sense.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the lesson in the past/current trials of awardees and others<br/>
awaiting the awarding of a MOH.  I'll try to ensure that I do not end up<br/>
making a mockery of the very thing I myself volunteered for.  I'll also try<br/>
not to make a mockery of the supreme sacrifice and the courage that past and<br/>
any future awardees have made<br/>
<br/>
Back to the question/statement at hand.... As far as a 'Medal of Honor'<br/>
stamp, I'd like to try my hand at designing and carving one... I'll then put<br/>
the design up on the web and let ya'll decide if you want to use it.<br/>
<br/>
I am glad, supremely glad, that you are not nixing the idea of a special<br/>
stamp for those that have gone the extra mile.... I don't remember saying<br/>
that I'd call mine a MOH though.... Since you did not ask, let me share the<br/>
name I had in mind:<br/>
<br/>
          The Tenacious Bulldog (TTB Award) - Complete with a certificate<br/>
and all, awardees determined by the people of this list.<br/>
<br/>
Enough ramblings, I'll let you folks chew on this for awhile.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm writing to you privately to respectfully ask that if you do carve<br/>
&gt; a stamp to give to those who go the extra distance in letterboxing<br/>
&gt; that it not resemble the real Medal of Honor in any way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing is a hobby and not anything that resembles the<br/>
&gt; situations Medal of Honor winners have survived.  Why not have a<br/>
&gt; competition to design such a stamp?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I ask this because I realize what an honor it is for those who are<br/>
&gt; bestowed with this Medal.  At this time, there is quite the campaign<br/>
&gt; going on to award Major Winters (of Band of Brothers fame) with this<br/>
&gt; medal.  He certainly earned it and it would be a mockery of all of<br/>
&gt; his bravery and selflessness in such situations to carve and award<br/>
&gt; such a stamp to those of us engaged in a hobby.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please realize that I'm not nixing the idea of having an award of<br/>
&gt; sorts for this type of situation, only that I very earnestly request<br/>
&gt; that it not be called or resemble the Medal of Honor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for your time and consideration.<br/>

We dont really need to borrow from the MOH to have a medal. Its <br/>
kinda fun to have our own "original" medal and all the better if it <br/>
doesn't offend. Just my two cents. *shrugging shoulders*<br/>

Thank you for the vote of confidence.  I'm working on carving my Snow Dogs series, my 2nd Hitchhiker, HitchBiker Dude, and my Misguided Salmon Migration series, but I'll sneak the TTB award in there as well.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of being busy, Team Rayvenhaus is moving in September, if all goes well, to Chehalis, Wa.  Things will be hectic for awhile, but I am sure we'll have a ton more fun down there than in Tacoma.  We're going to be living like 500 feet from the entrance to Rainbow Falls Park and I think I could hide a hundred boxes in that place, it is so beautiful.<br/>

  &gt; Back to the question/statement at hand.... As far as a 'Medal of Honor'<br/>
  &gt; stamp, I'd like to try my hand at designing and carving one... I'll<br/>
  then put<br/>
  &gt; the design up on the web and let ya'll decide if you want to use it.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I am glad, supremely glad, that you are not nixing the idea of a special<br/>
  &gt; stamp for those that have gone the extra mile.... I don't remember<br/>
  saying<br/>
  &gt; that I'd call mine a MOH though.... Since you did not ask, let me<br/>
  share the<br/>
  &gt; name I had in mind:<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;           The Tenacious Bulldog (TTB Award) - Complete with a<br/>
  certificate<br/>
  &gt; and all, awardees determined by the people of this list.<br/>
