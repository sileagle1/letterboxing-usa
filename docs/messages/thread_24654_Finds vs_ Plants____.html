Have you hand carved all the plants that you've planted? How many is it anyway?<br/>

You had me there for a while. I thought maybe you'd planted 100's. Good for you for doing what you do.<br/>
I've been boxing for 2 years now and have found almost 300 and only planted 4 traditional, 1 hitch hiker and 6 postals. I'm getting more into the carving now though. I really like it. So, there should be more Mas boxes coming soon! Where are your boxes planted?<br/>
