                    <div class="plaintext-content">	Today, one half of the Traveling Circus (The Minstrel, The Plundering <br/>
Bunny and Windairen), went hunting for Jack.  He eluded us at first, and at <br/>
second and at third.. but after running into many, many, many dead ends we <br/>
finally caught up with him, the Oreo cookie milkshake we ran into along the <br/>
way gave us the strength to carry on till the end.<br/>
	After our spirits had been raised by the discovery of Jack, we decided to <br/>
seek out the Troll and Dragon of Rock Creek Park.  Night had set on by now, <br/>
of course, leaving us somewhat in the dark.  However, a small greenish <br/>
light shone through our despair when the Plundering Bunny produced her <br/>
trusty palm pilot.  With the help of William (the palm pilot), we finally <br/>
tracked down both of Rock Creek Park's resident beasts, getting only <br/>
slighty damp in the process.  Just another exciting day in the life of the <br/>
Traveling Circus.  Stay tuned for more thrilling adventures (and possibly <br/>
another letterbox series)  to come....<br/>
