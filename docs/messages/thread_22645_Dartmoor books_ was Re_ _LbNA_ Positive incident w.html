&gt; I've been re-reading my Dartmoor books and web sites to prepare for<br/>
&gt; our trip there next month, and I've seen the original container at<br/>
&gt; Cranmere pool variously described as a "stone jar" and a "jam jar,"<br/>
&gt; among others. I interpreted the "stone jar" reference as "stoneware,"<br/>
&gt; a kind of pottery -- I have a couple of antique pieces of this kind<br/>
&gt; of container used for foodstuffs during that same period, so that<br/>
&gt; seems to make the most sense to me. It probably was corked.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking of planning a trip there in the summer myself. I would love to<br/>
hear what books you have, &amp; whether you recommend them or not. And, not just<br/>
Silent Doug, anyone who has some titles to discuss! Thanks!<br/>
