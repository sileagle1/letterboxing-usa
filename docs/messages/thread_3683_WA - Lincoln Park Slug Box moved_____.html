the deep sea diving equiptment and fighting rabid salmon it was retrieved<br/>
safe and sound and just a bit damp. So there we stood on the hillside, hands<br/>

The clues take you up the hill and then a right to the water well uhhh I<br/>
mean tree you hid it in. Now when you take that right on the hillside,  just<br/>
steps away is another tree with Ivy growing on it. Inside a crevice under<br/>
leaves is the box. When standing looking down at the tree there is a stump<br/>
just behind you.<br/>

Only thing we could think of doing. After eating pages out of the first book<br/>

(...and to think I made the Catbird stick his arm into that dark frightening pool of water for nothing!)<br/>

Now I'm going to have to go back to that great park... <sigh><br/>
