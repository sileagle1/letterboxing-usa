&gt; Hi all! It's me Rustypuff!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's been a long crazy year and I thought what better way to end it <br/>
than with a winter gathering.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like to invite all 'boxers to join us on Saturday January <br/>
18th beginning at high noon (although ongoing after that for late <br/>
comers) at the Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon, MA in the <br/>
Nature Center for a winter potluck.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will provide soft drinks and juice and an appetizer. There will <br/>
also be a hot drink table with tea, instant coffee and hot cocoa. <br/>
Bring along your favorite dish (and recipes! since that seems so <br/>
popular!)and your letterboxing gear. There are five boxes on the <br/>
sanctuary here and I will probably be hiding a box for the gathering. <br/>
I will also carve an event stamp, but would encourage others to do <br/>
the same.The more the merrier!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The event will be hosted by me (Rustypuff)and CSCM, and though I <br/>
work at the Sanctuary, please don't contact them for information. <br/>
Just post to the list for either one of us and we will answer any <br/>
questions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please RSVP to me and I will keep a count of who's coming (gotta <br/>
know how much soda to buy!). Also please note, pets are not allowed <br/>
at the Sanctuary(sorry! - not my rule)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am excited to see you all (since I missed the Mystery gathering) <br/>
and I hope you all have a wonderful holiday!!  (directions are below)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers!<br/>
