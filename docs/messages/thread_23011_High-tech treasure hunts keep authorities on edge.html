`Geocaches' have been mistaken for terrorism devices.<br/>
<br/>
By Christopher Smith, Associated Press, appearing in The Herald,<br/>
Bradenton, FL<br/>
Wednesday, January 18, 2006<br/>
Reproduced by Oldhounder<br/>
<br/>
Boise, Idaho  In a game of global positioning called geocaching, the<br/>
lowly treasure hunt has gone high-techbut it can also be a game of<br/>
risk when terrorism-sensitive authorities find the goods first.<br/>
<br/>
Scot Tintsman found that out when he stashed a green bucket under an<br/>
Idaho highway bridge last September, intending to fill it with goodies<br/>
for other players to find using Global Positioning System units.  But<br/>
before he could finish adding the requisite trinkets and log books and<br/>
posting its GPS coordinates on the Internet, a bridge inspection crew<br/>
found it.<br/>
<br/>
Rounding a corner on his motorcycle to finish rigging his cache, he<br/>
was greeted by a barricade of police cars and a bomb squad.  He<br/>
struggled to explain the misunderstanding.<br/>
<br/>
"I got off my bike and three officers approached me very cautiously,<br/>
hands on their holsters," he said.  "I was trying to turn off my MP3<br/>
player and I think they were worried I was going for a detonator."<br/>
<br/>
Tintsman and other geocachers play the game this way: Participants<br/>
stash a vessel of some sort containing goods as a reward for the<br/>
person who finds the "cache," as it is known.  The person or group<br/>
hiding the cache posts the hiding place's GPS coordinates on the<br/>
Internet.  People who find the cache are expected to take something<br/>
from it and replace it with something else.<br/>
<br/>
In November, a geocache outside a police station in Provo, Utah, met a<br/>
bomb squad as its fate. It contained a toy gun, holster and nightstick.<br/>
<br/>
In June, a bomb squad in De Pere, Wis., used a robot-mounted shotgun<br/>
to blast the lid off a suspicious looking military ammunition box<br/>
found in a park.  It also turned out to be a geocache.<br/>
<br/>
Many geocachers fear the pastime could be banned in some areas because<br/>
of the scares caused by ill-advised cache placements.  A "Geocacher's<br/>
Creed" posted on  the Internet asks participants to "avoid causing<br/>
disruptions or public alarm."<br/>
<br/>
Even when geocachers cause public alarm, severe criminal repercussions<br/>
appear to be rare.<br/>
<br/>
Tintsman, whose geocache sat high above the whitewater of Idaho's<br/>
Payette River, was charged with placing debris on public property, a<br/>
misdemeanor punishable by six months in jail and a $300 fine.<br/>
<br/>
Tintsman said he is still avidly geocaching  but with a better<br/>
awareness of how it might look in a post-Sept. 11 landscape.<br/>
<br/>
"I wasn't thinking about terrorism when I placed it under the bridge.<br/>
 I was thinking about making the most extreme cache possible," he<br/>
said.  "I just got carried away."<br/>

<br/>
What is the city's definition of "debris"?  Are we all in jeopardy of having a fine imposed upon us?<br/>
<br/>
One of the letterboxes we found in a state park was also part of a geocache in a military ammunition box.  Even though we knew what it was, it was unnerving to find it.<br/>

Great story. And SO true.<br/>
<br/>
I've been called out of the woods and bushes a couple times by <br/>
authority figures (and before you say anything, I WAS letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
I should make that a count too.<br/>

Funny you should mention that. Just the other day I found a geocache that was in an ammo container (which is not unusual) and it had explosive stickers still on it. I envisioned the ruckus it was going to cause when an ordinary muggle stumbled across it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 Yes, It's very unusual.<br/>
<br/>
 I am at 7893 Cache finds. I have placed over 170 caches on both Geocaching.com<br/>
and Navicache.com.  I have had at one time over 200 letterboxes placed.  Ammo<br/>
boxes are becoming rare. In all of my cache finds only 11 of them were in<br/>
Ammo boxes. <br/>
<br/>
Most State parks and County parks do not let you place them anymore.  I am the <br/>
contact for my county on both hobby's. No ammo boxes are to be placed in our <br/>
county parks.<br/>
<br/>
 Most states have laws on placing stuff in domain area's (I.E. Road Sides) so<br/>
yes, Fines and jail time for that is now a big possibility. We look at our hobby<br/>
as fun, Most people who do not are looking at our boxes as trash. Road side<br/>
placements without permission is in fact trash.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm I happy about this? No I am not but you have to adapt tp keep the hobby<br/>
going. We started helping our parks because we did not want permits in the<br/>
parks, We tried to talk about road side caches and were rejected.<br/>

I have been waiting for things like this to happen more.  I think it<br/>
is something we all need to be mindful of as we hide our boxes.<br/>
<br/>
As for ammo containers, I don't think they should be used at all.  In<br/>
England they used to use military paraphernelia, but it was eventually<br/>
banned since Dartmoor also uses the area for military drills and<br/>
children could pick up active shells thinking they were<br/>
letterboxes--definitely not good. <br/>
<br/>
Here I don't think that would be as specific of a concern, but I can't<br/>
believe someone would have the stupidity in this day and age to plant<br/>
something in a site that could be prone to terrorists or something<br/>
like a fake gun outside of a police station as the article said.  I<br/>
can just see them thinking about what a fun little pun it would be and<br/>
not even imagining that it might cause panic or alarm.  We have to<br/>
think before we plant--whether it be a cache or a LB!<br/>
<br/>
just my little rant!  I don't want to see a wonderful hobby banned<br/>
because of the stupidity of a few!<br/>
