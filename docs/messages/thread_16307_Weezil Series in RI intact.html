series in Johnston, RI.  All three boxes are in their places, <br/>
intact.  None are missing.  I checked today.  There were a few <br/>
people who emailed me, saying they couldn't find the first box.  <br/>
It's there.  Also, when it's really wet here in RI, the path to the <br/>
first box may be a little muddy.  But if you're in love with <br/>
letterboxing as much as I am, a little mud is a small price to pay.  <br/>
Follow the directions closely, pay attention to what you see.  <br/>
Thanks for the responses, and happy Letterboxing!!!<br/>
P.s.  The Scituate art festival and Johnston Autumnfest are both <br/>
this Columbus day weekend.  What a great time to go letterboxing in <br/>
Scituate and Johnston!<br/>
