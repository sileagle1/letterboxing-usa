&gt; Name: W. McLean<br/>
&gt; Box: Ste. Sedna<br/>
&gt; Date placed: Will be in place on or before July 21st, 2001<br/>

&gt; Jim on his landing expressed with disdain,<br/>
&gt; "This must be the place once allotted to Cain."<br/>
&gt; Some said this vast barren patch of earth<br/>
&gt; "Was found by the English; there's nothing of worth."<br/>
&gt; Abounding in nickel and iron so cold,<br/>
&gt; What does this place have to do with gold?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From your own home shores you will find your way<br/>
&gt; To a rock-bound coast, and a sea storm-tossed,<br/>
&gt; Where you must find yourself triple-crossed<br/>
&gt; If you wish to find me some fine day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From the land of Brtagne to that of the Basque<br/>
&gt; Is your first appointed crossing task;<br/>
&gt; Thence north to the roving Norseman's lands,<br/>
&gt; Look yonder! Can you see white find sands?<br/>
&gt; And finally on to traverse the fine line<br/>
&gt; That was scratched in the moss two years ere two-nine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; St. Andrew for old Scotland pined;<br/>
&gt; St. Lawrence's sentry, St. Paul, is long behind;<br/>
&gt; David, George, Paul, and John,<br/>
&gt; All have come and all have gone;<br/>
&gt; (Let not St. Anthony lead you astray.)<br/>
&gt; By His holy beard make now your way.<br/>
&gt; Did you notice Ste. Thrse of Lisieux?<br/>
&gt; Our patron-saint of missions; you're on a mission too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Theresa parted from this earth not forty years before<br/>
&gt; The line was drawn to mark this place; I cannot yet say more.<br/>
&gt; And she the patron of flyers too, a curious renown,<br/>
&gt; For there landed not far hence bird-men of Bremen-town.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A year before the bird-men came the line was firmly drawn,<br/>
&gt; Their landing place changed hands that year, and so too did the bawn,<br/>
&gt; Another parallel with that meridional line:<br/>
&gt; But all were soon re-unified in two-score year and nine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A final Saint is in this cove: could she be Ste. Clare?<br/>
&gt; Or was it just that Frenchmen saw a lot of lightning there?<br/>
&gt; By chance the harbour waters were uncommonly clean?<br/>
&gt; And now you should have crossed the line; if you know what I mean.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Look for the Aurora Borealises;<br/>
&gt; Risk no error now; be not mislead by fallacies.<br/>
&gt; Day and night, cloudy or fair;<br/>
&gt; Roadside you'll find it here, could I be more clear?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You now approach the appointed station,<br/>
&gt; Be bold; or have you any reservation?<br/>
&gt; Ask and it shall be given you, seek and ye shall find;<br/>
&gt; If ye ring, ring, ring the bell then you'll claim that "this prize is<br/>
mine."<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A cross stick marks not the site of my protection,<br/>
&gt; But a cross stick of sorts will give you some vague direction.<br/>
&gt; Seven and eight, don't be late; these clues you may re-contemplate;<br/>
&gt; Alpha, not omega, to re-arrange and allocate.<br/>
