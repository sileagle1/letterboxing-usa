after the New England Authors series.  The first box seems to be missing<br/>
(someone visited yesterday and put a note saying the same thing in the<br/>
second box), but the other three are fine.  The only thing is that the<br/>
logbooks are FULL!  At least one of the books has continued onto the<br/>
backside of already stamped pages.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for a great afternoon - Eric and Nora got to check out their<br/>
new kiddie carrier backback, and it was our dog Chaucer's first letterbox<br/>
outing!<br/>
