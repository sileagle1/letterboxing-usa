Frank,<br/>
thanks for downloading my database. according to my developer's <br/>
handbook there is a way to code the form view to automatically size <br/>
itself to the enduser's screen resolution regadless of the <br/>
programmers settings. it will scale the form and font accordingly. i <br/>
have not implented this feature yet but will add it to my list. i do <br/>
realize not everybody likes 1024x768.<br/>
<br/>
keep the feedback coming. i am getting some great suggestions. <br/>
anybody have a MAC PC i can borrow?<br/>

&gt; Yo Hexacat!<br/>
&gt; I just downloaded your database this morning. It's very nicely <br/>
&gt; designed. Thank you for the many days I know you put into it.<br/>
&gt; I run Access 2004, and did not get a read-only error. I don't know <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; that's because of the Access version or if you fixed it, but I <br/>
&gt; thought you ought to know.<br/>
&gt; My bad old eyes just can't handle the smallness at a resolution of <br/>
&gt; 1024X768; we use 800X600. Reducing the column widths helps a bit at <br/>
&gt; 800x600, but not enough. Is there any way you'll let me get past <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; permissions so I can resize the forms for our resolution? I do know <br/>
&gt; my way around in Access. <br/>
&gt; If you happen to be a fiction writer, perhaps I can interest you in <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; trade:  I've built a fairly cool random name generator in Access<br/>
&gt; (using US Census Bureau data) that I'd pass along to you in <br/>
exchange <br/>
&gt; for those permissions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
