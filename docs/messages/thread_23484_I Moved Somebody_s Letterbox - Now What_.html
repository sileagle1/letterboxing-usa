                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, here's what happened:  I found the Hedgehog Mountain letterbox in <br/>
Aroostook County, Northern Maine.  Unfortunately, the box was a mess <br/>
because it had been hidden in a spot that gets flooded.  Thinking I'd <br/>
be doing a good thing, I rebuilt the box as well as I was able and <br/>
rehid it in a *new* location, one not likely to cause such problems.  <br/>
Then that evening I clicked on "contact the placer" and sent the <br/>
owner, Browneyes96, a message describing what I had done and how the <br/>
clues needed to be changed so that others can find the box at the new <br/>
location.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently nothing has happened.  I've had no response from <br/>
Browneyes96, positive or negative, and the clues remain unaltered.  <br/>
If anyone goes up there using the clues currently listed, they're not <br/>
likely to find the box.  So what can I do to make this right?<br/>
<br/>
I'm about 1400 miles away in Florida now, I won't be going back to <br/>
make further adjustments.<br/>

<br/>
As no one has tackled this her Ladyship shall adopt a stern motherly<br/>
tone and take this on. <br/>
<br/>
What were you thinking? While altruism is a laudable characteristic<br/>
one should temper ones zeal with reason. If one were possessed of the<br/>
knowledge that one would not be with in less than a 1400 mile radius<br/>
of this box then the prudent course of action would be to repair the<br/>
box with such paraphernalia as one has on ones person, replace it<br/>
EXACTLY where found and contact the placer advising such of your<br/>
suspicions that the box was placed in a diluvian environment. This<br/>
also begs the question of your familiarity with the environment. If<br/>
one is visiting an area and is not a PhD geologist it could be an<br/>
erroneous conclusion that the area is flood prone. The box may have<br/>
been in an area that experienced a freak inundation but is otherwise<br/>
arrid. Again your admirable desire to do a good deed may have led you<br/>
to an incorrect assumption. <br/>
<br/>
This chiding though is of no real value to the present situation<br/>
albeit something to consider in the future and hopefully a cautionary<br/>
tale for others. The situation at hand is a box whose whereabouts are<br/>
now unknown to the placer and the new location is known only to you.<br/>
This untenable situation should not be without remedy. It would be her<br/>
Ladyship's recommendation that you make another attempt to contact the<br/>
placer by requesting that they contact you. If you do this on the<br/>
other well known letterboxing sites you may be able to find them or<br/>
someone who knows them. You then will have to apologize for your<br/>
Olympic caliber conclusion jumping and provide them with the location<br/>
so that they may remedy the problem. If after a reasonable time of say<br/>
one or 2 weeks there is no response from the placer it would be her<br/>
Ladyship's recommendation that you request that someone in the<br/>
vicinity who could return this box to it's original location contact<br/>
you that you may advise them of the current location so that they can<br/>
relocate it. Neither should one assume that a few attempts to contact<br/>
the placer are sufficient, they may merely be incommunicado or simply<br/>
taking a break from the hobby. Her Ladyship feels that the most<br/>
responsible course of action is to return it to it's original place<br/>
and await the placers return. If they never do and the box is lost in<br/>
a flood then that is the placers problem not yours, the box including<br/>
it's location ultimately still belongs to the placer not the larger<br/>
letterboxing world.<br/>
<br/>
Placement of a letterbox is sacred to many placers and one should<br/>
never attempt to make corrections. There may be many reasons one does<br/>
not immediately grasp for placing a box in a certain location. Many a<br/>
boxer has been tempted to move a box that they feel may have been<br/>
re-hidden incorrectly assuming that they know better than the last<br/>
person to stamp in or even than the placer. Such confidence is to<br/>
snatch a grace beyond reason. One cannot know the intentions, or for<br/>
that matter intellectual capabilities of the placer. They may have it<br/>
all wrong and you may be right but one should never "mess" with<br/>
someone else's creation. Contact the placer and advise them of their<br/>
folly but one should never assume that one knows better no matter how<br/>
confident one is. It is never impolite to express your honest concerns<br/>
but is always impolite to assume the authority to make corrections.<br/>
Her Ladyship hopes that the mere suggestion of such a scenario<br/>
involving ones mother would make this clear but lets imagine it.<br/>
You've invited your mother to your home for dinner, she enters scans<br/>
you with the intensity of a 3 tesla Magnetic resonance imager and asks<br/>
what on earth you've done to your hair while rearranging the flowers<br/>
in the centerpiece and clicking her tongue as she places the desert<br/>
fork at the top of the plate instead of to the left of the plate. Does<br/>
this illustrate the situation clearly enough?<br/>
<br/>
I hope this information is helpful. Remember that repairs are fine as<br/>
long as they don't involve altering or replacing a stamp or log book<br/>
or changing the location. All these things are integral to the<br/>
artistic expression of the placer. Torn baggies broken Tupperware are<br/>
all fair game. If a log book is full leaving a second one is fine but<br/>
don't remove the original and contact the placer and let he or she<br/>
know what you've done. Even replacing the container is iffy; her<br/>
Ladyship occasionally uses a fine delft jar and would shudder to think<br/>
that it had been replaced with Tupperware.<br/>
<br/>
Warmest regard,<br/>
Lady Prisspott<br/>
