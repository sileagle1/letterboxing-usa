                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've received many wonderful emails about our Barb of the Hook box and I <br/>
know many of you have found it. Recently though, a fellow letterboxer tried to <br/>
uncover it and had no luck. This was after the hurricane and, I guess, the area <br/>
is a real mess and clues from "the monument" to the box can't be clear with <br/>
all the junk that's been strewn around.<br/>
<br/>
After receiving the email from this person, I replied with explicit <br/>
directions and even emailed a photo of me placing the box at the "outcropping" so he <br/>
could identify it more clearly. He went back and still could not locate it. <br/>
<br/>
Since we live in Calif and don't have plans to visit PA anytime soon, I <br/>
wonder if some wonderful LBer who's gotten this box before might be able to locate <br/>
it, check on it for us and report. It would be much appreciated.<br/>
