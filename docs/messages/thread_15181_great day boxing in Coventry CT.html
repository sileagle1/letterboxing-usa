                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a great day boxing in Coventry CT yesterday.  Licks our cousin from NY and Irish TInker and I found the brand new Constitution State box and the Coventry Grammer School box (this one without clues.  Irish Tinker has an amazing sixth sense for where boxes may be!)  <br/>
Licks and I then did Irish Tinkers Presidential Animals and The Actors Colony.  We loved the history attached to both series and had a lot of fun.  The boxes were all in great shape and in really great locations.  <br/>
I finally reached my 200th find!!!<br/>
Thanks to everyone who plants boxes and givers opportunities to go to great places!!!<br/>
