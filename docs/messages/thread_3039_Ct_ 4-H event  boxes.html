                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Everyone! Just a reminder this weekend is the Tolland County 4-H <br/>
Fair where you can drop in enjoy a little fair and do 10-12 boxes and <br/>
collect the special event stamp! 4-H Families are preparing boxes and <br/>
writing clues  already! Some of the boxes were placed  tonight. We <br/>
will have a guest book so please stamp that too. You should be able <br/>
to pick up some good exchanges if you don't catch us in the middle of <br/>
the dairy or sheep show ( Fri 11-2) . Friday  after 4 there is a <br/>
$10.00 fee for the country music concert on the lawn. Wonder what the <br/>
cows will think of that!  The rest of the fair the parking fee is <br/>
minimal and children are free. Fees go to support the 4-H program in <br/>
our county. <br/>
   We are discussing donating the fair boxes to a special care <br/>
hospital  so they can be used there for the patients to seek. <br/>
   Hope to see many of you there. Carol - leader of the pack<br/>

As an alumnus of the FFA I have many friends who were<br/>
(are) involved with 4-H. The fair sounds like great<br/>
fun, I am unsure if I am going to make it there tho...<br/>
I was unable to attend the Stonington Fair and that's<br/>
right down the road from me....<br/>
   One thing tho:<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;&gt;The rest of the fair the parking fee is minimal and<br/>

<br/>
If I attend the fair do I have to recieve a child? I<br/>
know some parents who want to get rid of their kids,<br/>
but I didn't realise they were giving them away at 4-H<br/>
fairs!<br/>

Good luck at the 4-H deal.  I wish I could be there.  Sounds like a<br/>
wonderful time for all!  You do a wonderful job at promoting<br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>

Your reply about children free at the 4-H fair is hilarious.  It totally<br/>
started my day off with a huge laugh.  Thanks!  <br/>
