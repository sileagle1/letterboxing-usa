Yes, thank you very, very, very much to all LBNA webmasters.  I deeply <br/>
appreciate the website and the incredible work you all did to make this <br/>
possible for so long.  The new site/format looks really great and easy to use <br/>
and was a briliant idea.  Thank you very much for this, Wes, and to all of <br/>
you for what you gave us.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; LbNA has gone through several evolutions in the 5+ years in <br/>
business. <br/>
&gt; From a collection of a few early-Smithsonian enthusiasts (all but <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; still intimately involved in the website) and a few scattered <br/>
&gt; letterboxes, we've grown through two distinct versions of a hand-<br/>
&gt; crafted website where your clues were painstakingly added one by <br/>
one <br/>
&gt; from the yahoogroup to the LbNA site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We're too big for that now!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of our webmasters, Wes Garrison in Kansas City, has developed a <br/>
&gt; very professional automatic website where everyone will be able to <br/>
&gt; enter and maintain their own clues. It will be quite flexible and <br/>
&gt; easy to use, and will save the sanity (perhaps even the marriages) <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; more than one web host.<br/>

We will be keeping both sites up for a period of time during the <br/>
conversion.  We would encourage everyone to transfer their own clues <br/>
but the webmasters will do so for those that can't, choose not to or <br/>
are no longer involved.  If you have your own website you will see <br/>
that you will be able to link to your own webpages and are still <br/>
able to exercise creative control that way should you choose.  <br/>

<br/>
I have a few questions: when I went to the site the <a href="www.letterboxing.org">www.letterboxing.org</a> main <br/>
icon/screen didn't come up .... I'm sure it was just a glitch that is still <br/>
being smoothed out.<br/>
<br/>
When people go to the <a href="www.letterboxing.org">www.letterboxing.org</a> will it automatically take them to <br/>
the new site?   I have info floating around and in my log books with that <br/>
link address.  Just wondering?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,  Mohmers<br/>

&gt; LbNA has gone through several evolutions in the 5+ years in business. <br/>
&gt; From a collection of a few early-Smithsonian enthusiasts (all but one <br/>
&gt; still intimately involved in the website) and a few scattered <br/>
&gt; letterboxes, we've grown through two distinct versions of a hand-<br/>
&gt; crafted website where your clues were painstakingly added one by one <br/>
&gt; from the yahoogroup to the LbNA site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We're too big for that now!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Yes, we've made hundreds of info sheets with the letterboxing.org <br/>
address....no problem changing new ones, but it may take a year to <br/>
change old ones everywhere.  It sure would be a help to have an <br/>
auto-refreshing link.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!!!! to all the webmasters for their fantastic efforts!<br/>

Thank you to the creator/creators of the new site and to all the <br/>
other people behind the scenes at the old site who have helped to <br/>
make this such a great hobby. I have often wondered as I sorted <br/>
through message after message how the webmasters find the time. This <br/>
surely will lighten their load (at least after the conversion:) <br/>
<br/>
All my links are now on the new site.<br/>
