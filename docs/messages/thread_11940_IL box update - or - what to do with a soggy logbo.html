                    <div class="plaintext-content">What beautiful weather this weekend in Illinois, good time to check up<br/>
on a few of my letterboxes:<br/>
<br/>
I replaced the lost Starved Rock Buffet box with a new one. New clues<br/>
to follow shortly...<br/>
<br/>
The Effigy Tumuli box is doing fine, though the container looks to<br/>
have been attacked by a woodpecker. The logbook is one of those<br/>
miniature composition notebooks with a speckled cover and glued<br/>
binding and its falling apart already! I don't think I'll be using<br/>
these anymore, but I like how it looks more like a miniature book than<br/>
a spiral-bound notebook.<br/>
<br/>
The Magic Hedge box was dry in its container, but the logbook was<br/>
sopping wet inside its ziploc bag! I'm not sure how this happened,<br/>
must have been the rapid melting of the snowstorm we had last week?<br/>
The binding of the hardbound sketchbook was so sogged it fell off when<br/>
I opened it! So I took it home to do some amateur book binding. The<br/>
interior pages of the book are holding together, so its just a matter<br/>
of putting a new cover on it and pressing the whole thing flat again.<br/>
It should be ready to bring back on Tuesday, in case anyone was<br/>
looking for it while it was at the book doctor.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad I used a decent sketchbook for the logbook, because its<br/>
repairable. What a patina this logbook now has! It should last for a<br/>
few more years, and maybe even a few more cover replacements. From now<br/>
on I think I'll only use log books that can be repaired if they get wet.<br/>

I found the MAGIC HEDGE last night!!  It's hard to believe it was in such bad shape.  You must have done a REMARKABLE repair job.  I even made a note on my log that it had survived the Chicago winter very nicely!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a GREAT hunt!  Too bad I was climbing through those dang shrubs at 8:30 pm with the whipping off the lake - I was COLD!  It was DARK, and it was kind of spooky.  I guess letterboxing is a DAY TIME hobby.<br/>
