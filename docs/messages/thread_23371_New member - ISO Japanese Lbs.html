Howdy from the God's Country - Texas of course!  I've just read <br/>
about and gotten excited about starting into Letterboxing.  My kids <br/>
and I have decided to try for 3 local ones this weekend.  We'll make <br/>
our stamps Friday, I hope.  <br/>
<br/>
The question I have is, my sister lives and works in Japan and <br/>
travels with her circus (yes she's a clown) through the country of <br/>
Japan.  I think she would love to get into this kind of recreation.  <br/>
Is there a site for finding Lbs in Japan or are there any?  Any help <br/>
would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
