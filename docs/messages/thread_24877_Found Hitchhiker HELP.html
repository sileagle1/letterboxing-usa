Sometimes (actually very often) HH's are not listed anywhere.  Just move <br/>
it along on it's way and don't worry about it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a tough one.  I checked Pete and Wanda's website and it isn't listed there.  There is a HH listed on AQ and LBNA called "The Chocolate Traveler HH - one by Choi and the other by Letterbox Locators - created in 2006.  Can you tell when the box started and what state?  Perhaps it was launched by the owner of the LB as a HH.  You could contact the owner of the first box that is stamped in the logbook and see if it belongs to them.  Otherwise, no sure what else can be done.<br/>

  Enjoy!<br/>
