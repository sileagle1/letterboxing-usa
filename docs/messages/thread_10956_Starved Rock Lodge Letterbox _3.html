<p>Starved Rock Lodge Letterbox #3</p>
<p>Situated on a high bluff just southwest of the rock itself is the stone and 
log lodge built in </p>
<p>part by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930’s. The lodge has been 
refurbished, but still reflects the peaceful atmosphere of yesteryear. The lodge 
features a caf, gift shop, restaurant, an indoor swimming pool, children’s 
pool, whirlpool, saunas and an outdoor sunning patio. The lodge also offers 72 
luxury rooms and 22 comfortable cabin rooms. The original Great Room is 
furnished with decorative rugs and art and is centered around a massive 
two-sided stone fireplace. </p>
<p>Some dates about Starved Rock State Park and Lodge</p><b>
</b><p>1673 Louis Jolliet and Father Jacques Marquette passed through here on 
their way up the Illinois from the Mississippi.</p><b>
</b><p>1682-1683 The French built Fort St. Louis atop Starved Rock.</p><b>
</b><p>1760’s The Legend of Starved Rock was born.</p>
<p>Pontiac, chief of the Ottawa tribe upriver from here, was slain by an 
Illiniwek while attending a tribal council in southern Illinois. According to 
the legend, during one of the battles that subsequently occurred to avenge his 
killing, a band of Illiniwek, under attack by a band of Potawatomi, sought 
refuge atop a 125 foot sandstone butte. The Ottawa and Potawatomi surrounded the 
bluff and held their ground until the Illinwek died of starvation—hence the name 
"Starved Rock"</p><b>
</b><p>1835 Daniel F. Hitt purchased Starved Rock for $85. </p><b>
</b><p>1890 Hitt sold Starved Rock and adjacent lands to Ferdinand 
Walther.</p><b>
</b><p>1911 Starved Rock was purchased by the State of Illinois and established 
as a State Park on June 10<sup>th</sup>.</p><b>
</b><p>1930’s Starved Rock Lodge was built in part by the Civilian Conservation 
Corps.</p><b>
</b><p>1986-1988 Renovation and addition to Starved Rock Lodge included 28 
rooms, indoor heated pool and improvements in the original building.</p><b>
</b><p>2001 Rocky the Trolley came to the lodge and offered history tours to 
guests.</p>
<p> </p><b>
</b><p>2003 In January Starved Rock Lodge constructed a waterfall display built 
in the lobby, using a big brown bear. This is where the hunt begins.</p>
<p>Take 20 up and find a letterbox of a different kind. Check it out, it is 
hidden there.</p></div></body></html>
