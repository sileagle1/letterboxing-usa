Yes Randy, it is me Glenn of<br/>
<br/>
glenn.hansen@usa.net and ggrrhh@hotmail.com<br/>
<br/>
I posted messages under the name BadgerButt AND WolverineButt, you missed<br/>
one!<br/>
<br/>
I was not trying to hide my identity or I would have used a different route<br/>
into the list, I was trying to make a point.<br/>
<br/>
Did you read the  message from badgerbutt, the one that started out with<br/>
"Sorry"?<br/>
<br/>
then I stated:<br/>
<br/>
"My point is, some people come into an established activity and within a<br/>
week<br/>
they seem to think it all has to be changed to their way. I have seen more<br/>
attempts to change NA Letterboxing and the list in the last month than in<br/>
the last year and a half. It wouldn't be so bad except most of the changes<br/>
have nothing to do with Letterboxing!"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So Badgerbutt AKA Evil Glenn did apologize and tried to clarify. I am not<br/>
going to change that stance.<br/>
<br/>
I do owe an apology to the LizardButt family. I should not have made you the<br/>
butt of my parody butt with lizardbutt it was just too easy.  I meant no<br/>
permanent damage or anything sinister by it. There is something weird about<br/>
posting through a child but who am I to talk about weird? I am sorry if I<br/>
hurt your feeling or offended you. It was not my intent.<br/>
<br/>
Dumpster time.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year a user made the State in Subject line request only to be<br/>
rudely badgered (no pun intended)<br/>
by another user. You said nothing .  I replied with a sarcastic remark that<br/>
included the words jacka** and maybe pi** and AFTER I said I would shut up<br/>
you made a public display of banishing glenn.hansen@usa.net from the LBNA<br/>
list. A simple personal request to me would have accomplished the same<br/>
results but without the fan-fare.<br/>
<br/>
Now today we have Randy with a long post and even a poll! Are you not<br/>
fearful I might lose control before then and spread more evil? :-) Even<br/>
though you say you don't,  you must love this Randy! A simple e-mail to me<br/>
saying "Glenn, get a grip and shut up." would have done wonders, at least<br/>
for 7 to 9 months. Or a simple E-mail saying "You are off the list Glenn."<br/>
would have worked too. Nope, we get a bigger and better dog and pony show<br/>
this time and a poll to boot. I would have felt better if you had titled it<br/>
"Shall we Ban the BadgerButt? " though. Oh well. Big hammers work too, just<br/>
not very well.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of Jeremy, I find it interesting that you allow him to call people<br/>
"morons" in this public forum.  If I had called Lizard Butt's Mom a moron<br/>
would you have mentioned that in your announcement? Is that a<br/>
new family thing you allow here now ? Will you run a poll to see if users<br/>
are<br/>
free to call each other "moron". And Jeremy. You can quit pinging my IP<br/>
address. I am not a City of Tacoma employee so your threat of disrupting my<br/>
life or job or whatever you meant is quite meaningless. Are threats now okay<br/>
on this list Randy?  Jeremy, here is a hint for you; Click! was built and is<br/>
owned by the City of Tacoma. I am not an employee, my ISP uses Click!'s<br/>
fiber. Go threaten somebody else who you don't agree with, moron. Or is it<br/>
only those you favor can make threats and call names. How does that work in<br/>
your Community Randy?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I got distracted.<br/>
<br/>
Save your energy Randy. I will voluntarily cease posting to the group. Good<br/>
enough? Now you can enjoy the rest of your Sunday doing something else and I<br/>
can plot how to smuggle my box clues onto the LBNA site. I will still enjoy<br/>
the hobby and so will you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sigh,<br/>
