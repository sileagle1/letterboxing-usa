                    <div class="plaintext-content">My grandfather is not doing well, so I am about to make a very quick trip from Dallas TX to Virginia Beach VA to visit him.  It is about a 20 hour drive, and I am not wanting to make the trip any longer than it already is, but yet still get in a little letterboxing along the way.  I, of course, have done the Trip Planner search on atlasquest, but thought some of you may have suggestions for some VERY QUICK DRIVE BY's that would be along the way.  The roads I am taking:  <br/>
<br/>
I 30 from Dallas TX to Little Rock AR<br/>
I 40 from Little Rock AR to Eastern Tennessee<br/>
I 81 from Eastern Tennessee to Staunton, VA<br/>
I 64 from Staunton, VA to Virginia Beach VA<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Knoxville, TN in particular has so many lb's to choose from that it's overwhelming trying to figure out which one would be the best (time-wise).  I am looking for boxes that are quick to get to (think a rest area along the way, or something right on the service road), and that don't involve a lot of walking.<br/>
<br/>
Under normal circumstances I love a great hike, but it's just not possible for this trip.<br/>

We're in Central VA, so here's what we can offer -<br/>
 From what we can remember (it's been a while since we found these <br/>
boxes) nothing in Richmond will fit your need for drive by + quick on <br/>
and off I-64.<br/>
We have a box at the New Kent County, VA rest area that won't help you <br/>
on your way out, but is a quick leg-stretcher on your way back west. <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/boxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=77943 If you get <br/>
a message that the box is not available, email privately and I'll send <br/>
you the clues.<br/>
If you have down time once you're in VA Beach, just search around your <br/>
location - there are lots and lots of quality drive bys by some talented <br/>
carvers.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Virginia Beach - again not exactly challenging hikes as the land is so <br/>

We're mostly flatland hikers except over short distances, so can't help <br/>
you with the mountains. I do know that Koyote and Bulldawg planted some <br/>

&gt; We have a box at the New Kent County, VA rest area that won't help you<br/>
&gt; on your way out, but is a quick leg-stretcher on your way back west.<br/>
<br/>
I know it is your box, but I thought it is in the east bound rest area?<br/>

No, that visitor center is definitely on the east bound side of the <br/>
highway.  We often stop there on the way to Busch Gardens (though not <br/>
last weekend).  There is a rest area on the west bound side, but it is a <br/>
standard rest area.  The welcome center offers information on the <br/>
Tidewater area.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the VDOT web page for the welcome center:<br/>
