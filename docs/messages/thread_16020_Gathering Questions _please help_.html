<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Could you all give me some pointers on setting up one of these gatherings.  I live in South New Jersey and I'm considering putting together a gathering down here by myself. This will be my first attending and organizing of a gathering.<br/>
<br/>
What usually goes on at one of the gatherings?<br/>
<br/>
  *Food, of course (do "most" people bring their own like pot luck?) <br/>
  *What's the most popular foods brought to them?<br/>
  *Exchanging of stamps (is this done first or all day?)<br/>
  *Event stamps (are they hidden at the location? or sitting on table? and what is done with the stamp when the event is done?) <br/>
  *Classes (like Alafair's journal making) <br/>
  *Is there anything else you guys have encountered at the gatherings?<br/>
<br/>
Do the gatherings usually require a theme or subject?<br/>
<br/>
What kind of place do you usually have these gatherings at?  State parks, county parks, public parks or parking lots?  <br/>
<br/>
I am looking to schedule this sometime around mid October.  <br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance if you could make some suggestions and pointers here.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your pending help.<br/>
