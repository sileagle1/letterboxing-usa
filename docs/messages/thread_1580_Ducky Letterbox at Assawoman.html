Assawoman WMA<br/>

When you see the first big sign for Assawoman WMA you should stop and pick up <br/>
a brochure. Return to your car and drive a very short distance to some red <br/>
barns on a curve in the road. Pull in there and park and get out and begin <br/>
your search for the letterbox. You should see a small white building close to <br/>
the road. Look between the that building and a fence behind some concrete <br/>
blocks. There you will find the letterbox. Isn't is ducky!  Return to your <br/>
car and continue on down to road to the entrance to the WMA. Hope you <br/>
remembered to bring you binoculars, there is good birding here.<br/>
