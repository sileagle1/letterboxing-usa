It is us that you met while we were 'boxing in Maine.<br/>
I've been meaning to e-mail you and haven't had the chance yet.<br/>
We found tons of boxes within an hour of where you live (not the<br/>
Eagle Lake one, though). The weather wasn't the best, but<br/>
we're out there in the snow and the sludge and the freezing cold<br/>
so it was more than bearable.  Keep in touch! We will be back<br/>
and let us know if you come south.<br/>
