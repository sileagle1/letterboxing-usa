                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure where you buy the heat gun, but it's gotta be in the same area as the inks and powders.  Yep, you ink up the image on the stamp with the embossing ink, pour on the powder, tap off the excess and put it back in the container for re-use.  The use a heat gun to melt/harden/set the powders and inks.  You hold the gun about 6 inches or so from the powders and keep it moving in a circular type motion over the powders.  You'll see it change, it doesn't take too long, once it does keep going to other sections until it all changes to a glossy finish.  Don't stay too long on one area and overheat it or it'll burn or melt too much.<br/>
<br/>
  Definately don't use a blowdryer, they don't  hot enough and they'll blow the powder around too much.  I think the guns are about $20-25, but of course you can use the 50% off coupons!  It would be cool on a logbook cover.  You can get embossing powders in several different colors.  You can add more than one color to your image if you want to get really creative.<br/>
<br/>
  As far as inks, my favorite is the Memories brand.  The are permanent dye based inks.  They're waterproof.  But, because they are dye inks, they dry quick.  The black is a true black and doesn't fade or discolor.<br/>

&gt; Embossing ink is a thick heavy ink that stays wet for a while. You <br/>
&gt; stamp your image, then pour embossing powder over the ink, tap off <br/>
&gt; the excess powder and then use a heat gun to "set" the powder. It'll <br/>
&gt; melt and harden, leaving the image raised (embossed) on the <br/>
&gt; paper.<br/>
<br/>
Ah! A heat gun! Does the heat melt the powder itself? And does the <br/>
heat also tend to dry the embossing ink, so that once done it's <br/>
pretty firmed up?<br/>
<br/>
I haven't noticed the heat guns. Are they for sale on the same rack <br/>
somewhere? Or do you just use a hair dryer?<br/>
<br/>
And do you generally apply such ink with a rubber stamp? Or is this <br/>
some other unrelated idea? If a rubber stamp is used, am I correct <br/>
in presuming it would need cleaning?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Very cool and simple way to enhance your images on cards, <br/>
&gt; scrapbooks, etc. Very bad idea for on-the-go letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Offhand, I'm thinking it might be a very cool idea for a letterbox <br/>
log book cover.<br/>
