are bike, kid or pet friendly.  Has there been any discussion on <br/>
putting symbols or a key on the master listing for each section that <br/>
would let the LB surfer know this info without opening up each <br/>
description and reading?  This would be more work for the webmasters <br/>
but might be worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion for discussion.<br/>

Yes, There has been discussion among the Webmasters regarding the<br/>
concept of symbols to further describe hikes.  We decided that we could<br/>
not imply a level of oversight that does not exist.  We cannot ourselves<br/>
know if the hike is such, as the poster of the clue makes a statement<br/>
and we forward their opinion along to the group.  We feel that we are an<br/>
information conduit but not an overseer.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you will continue to enjoy letterboxing even if you may need to<br/>
contact some box owners in advance.<br/>
