                    <html><body>Hi - I am new to letterboxing and have found that my family and I enjoy it immensely.  We've found a few letterboxes including 3 in Dupont, 2 near Chambers Creek and 1 at Spanaway Lake.  <br/>
<br/>
We decided to plant our own letterbox near the Elbe trains and I hope this is how I post instructions for it... if I am doing this wrong, will someone please notify me to let me know the proper posting method?<br/>
<br/>
Here's the directions to our Elbe Train Letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
~ Park in the parking lot of the Elbe Steam Engine Train Ride (Elbe is near Mt. Rainier).  You'll see a large holly tree and picnic tables to the right of the parking lot when you are facing the black steam engine.<br/>
~ Face the direction of the river; you'll see an opening to a wide trail; there is a house to the right of the trail and the Elbe Church that is a national historical landmark is next to the house.  Take the wide trail towards the river.<br/>
~ Follow the trail until you come to a Y; at this Y take a left.<br/>
~ Follow the trail until you come to another Y; at this Y take a right.<br/>
~ Follow this trail to the river &amp; go downstream until you reach a group of cedar saplings to your left.<br/>
~ From the group of cedar saplings, take approximately 30 paces downstream; there will be 2 trees approximately 2 1/2 ft. apart - one has 2 small trunks twisted together, the other is about 8" in diameter - facing the river in front of the 8" diameter tree, look to the right for the largest rock; there you'll find your treasure!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy the adventure; be sure to go downstream a bit more to find lots of animal tracks and droppings like elk, deer and beaver!  There's also a beaver's home complete with knawed-off trees.  Be sure to also take a peak in the Church which is interesting!  Oh!  and if you want lunch, be sure to get 'The Overload' at the tiny Scaleburgers place across from The Hobo Inn.<br/>

Its fine, but most people prefer the state abbrev in the subject line,<br/>
and the webmasters prefer that the county and town be listed with the clue,<br/>
for most clues.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
