Start at Pioneer Park on South Coddington and West Van Dorn.  Pioneer Park<br/>
Nature Center is on the southwestern edge of Lincoln. The Nature Center<br/>
features four miles of walking trails through native Nebraska prairie<br/>
grasses, woodlands and wetlands. A herd of bison, elk, white-tailed deer,<br/>
red fox, wild turkey and owls are exhibited in their natural Nebraska<br/>
habitat along the nature center trails. Open various hours during the week<br/>
and over the year.<br/>
<br/>
BOX 1 - This stamp will remind you of where Sarah came from.<br/>
Clue: Enter the parks east entrance. Make a right &amp; loop around the bison.<br/>
Pass the pond &amp; pull into the 2 space parking area. Between the rows of<br/>
evergreens start at the cement blocks. Take 20 steps and see a little<br/>
clearing &amp; trees on the left. Go in between trees. Step over a little ditch.<br/>
At base of tree to the right is the box.<br/>
<br/>
BOX 2 - Before Sarah came to the prairie she, Jacob, &amp; the children would do<br/>
this.<br/>
Clue: Go back to the loop by the bison and enter the road by the pond. Make<br/>
a left at the V go around the pond, make a left at V (if you drive it park<br/>
by the concession stand) Walk to the right on the paved path. Pass the fence<br/>
on your left. The path go  up and you will see a cement bench on the on your<br/>
left. Turn right. Walk straight to the bushes.  On the left side of the<br/>
bushes find your box.<br/>
<br/>
BOX 3 - Sarah came to the prairie by way of this.<br/>
Clue: Go back to the parking lot. Leave the lot by turning right. Turn left.<br/>
If you drive it park in the dirt area in front of the Indian Statue on the<br/>
hill. Walk to the statue. Follow the line of bricks as it curves around the<br/>
other side you will see a horse-shoe shaped wall. Stand at the bottom of the<br/>
horseshoe shaped wall. Spot the second brick over with the broken brick<br/>
along side. The box is under the larger brick.<br/>
<br/>
BOX  4 - Sarah told Jacob she would be wearing this.<br/>
Clue: Leave the parking area. Make a right, go up hill and make a left at<br/>
the fork. Enter the parking area. Look for the telephone at the pinewood<br/>
bowl. At the base of the ramp on the right tucked under you will find your<br/>
box.<br/>
