                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was Chicago last weekend for the "11th Annual Midwest Artificial<br/>
Intelligence and Cognitive Science Conference"  (In my personal life,<br/>
I'm a buccaneer pirate; in my professional life, I'm about as geek as<br/>
they come! :D)  While I didn't have a whole lot of free time because<br/>
of the conference, I did manage to do some letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Architectural Mystery -- alive and well<br/>
<br/>
Cars-On-A-Stick -- probably AWOL.  I know I was at the correct rock<br/>
and bush, but I simply couldn't find it and I scratched my arm up<br/>
looking for it.<br/>
<br/>
Fallen Star -- alive and well<br/>
<br/>
Bee's Knee's #3 -- alive and well  I was briefly confused for a couple<br/>
of minutes.  The clue "Defy the next arrow you see" needs to be<br/>
changed to "Defy the second arrow you see".  <br/>
<br/>
Painted Turtle -- alive and well  I also found a traveller, "Soaring<br/>
Seagull"  For one moment, I had this vivid image of the BC cartoon of<br/>
the turtle with the bird on his back. :D  The seagull returned with me<br/>
for a long voyage home in the crow's nest of my ship.  I could tell<br/>
you where I released him, but then I'd have to make you walk the plank! :D<br/>
