<p>Kathryn and I have just planted our first letterbox while on vacation to 
Cancun, Mexico. Its called the Chili Pepper Letterbox. Here are the 
directions:</p>
<p>The Chili Pepper Letterbox is located near Mayan ruins called Yamil Luum 
right in Cancun. Locate these ruins by finding the Sheraton Hotel along Cancuns 
main street. Go through the main lobby right out to the beach. Turn left to 
follow a walkway up to the ruins. After visiting the ruins, come back down the 
steps. Turn left and follow a stone path to a 3-way intersection (to your left 
is Snack Bar Playa). Turn right and follow this path about 24 steps. A pool area 
is on your left. Just before a cactus garden on your right, a small stone wall 
ends. (Be discreet. This is hotel property but can be reached from the public 
walkway.) Your treasure is under a few rocks right at the end of the small stone 
wall.</p>
<p>If you are the first one to find this box, please be so kind as to write in 
the date we put it there, December 28, 2000. In our excitement, we forgot to do 
this. Wed love to hear from anyone who visits the box. We are unlikely to get 
back to check it anytime soon, so take care to hide it well when youre done 
stamping in. Thanks! Ann T.</p></div></body></html>
