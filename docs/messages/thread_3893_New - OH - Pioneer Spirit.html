Here is my second "Museum and a Hike" quest. This one<br/>
will enhance your enjoyment of Caesar's Creek State<br/>
Park.  Plan on a couple hours for this one. You may<br/>
need topographic maps.  They can be printed from<br/>
www.topozone.com with the coordinates listed here. <br/>
The main map needed will be centered on the parking<br/>
coordinates for the second stage mentioned below. <br/>
Long pants are a good idea.  Some of the adventure is<br/>
off trail.  One portion is near a 20 foot drop-off, so<br/>
be careful with your pets, kids, and spouse.  <br/>
<br/>
For PART 1 of this adventure, go to the Pioneer<br/>
Village (Free admission) near Caesar's Creek Lake.<br/>
Park near N 39 29.161 W 84 02.295. At this location,<br/>
there is an old Toll House. It has dimensions <br/>
______ by ______ according to the sign on the house. <br/>
Answer A is the greater of those two dimensions.<br/>
Answer A ______ <br/>
<br/>
Question B: What year was the house at N 39 29.130 W<br/>
84 02.366 built? <br/>
Answer B _________ <br/>
<br/>
Question C: What is the height of the chimney of the<br/>
house at N 39 29.190 <br/>
W 84 02.383 (in feet)?<br/>
Answer C __________<br/>
<br/>
Question D: What year was the Inn at N 39 29.203 W 84<br/>
02.310 built?<br/>
Answer D ______ <br/>
<br/>
Multiply A * C Write result here: _______ Subtract 154<br/>
from that number. <br/>
XXX is the result of this subtraction.<br/>
XXX is ________<br/>
<br/>
Add B + D. Write the result here _________ Subtract<br/>
2962 from that number <br/>
YYY is the result of that subtraction.<br/>
YYY is _________<br/>
<br/>
SECOND PART: Go to N 39 31.360 W 83 58.665 and park.<br/>
You will need the topographic maps to use the country<br/>
roads to get to this spot.  Hike to the letterbox at N<br/>
39 31.XXX and W 83 58.YYY <br/>
<br/>
You can get to within 50 feet of the cache/letterbox<br/>
if you follow paths  but some of the paths have not<br/>
been used for several years. Take care with small<br/>
children. There are big drop offs here and there.  The<br/>
box is at the base of a large Oak tree.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy this pretty spot and rest at the end of your<br/>
quest. <br/>
