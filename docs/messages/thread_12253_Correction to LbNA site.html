<br/>
Just a small correction, I tried e-mailing the webmaster, but it keeps bouncing.<br/>
<br/>
Under Southeast NY, the "A Troll in Central Park" box is listed as being in Kings county.  That might deter some as Kings county is actually Brooklyn, not Manhattan.<br/>
<br/>
In the rest of the USA, Counties are made up of cities, but noooooo not in New York City.  NYC is made up of 5 counties, Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, Richmond (Staten Island), Bronx (Da Bronx) and New York (Manhattan).<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to get to that box!  I grew up within walking distance of it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
