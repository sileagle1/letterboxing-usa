Why is turtle wax so expensive? Turtles have very tiny ears!<br/>

Go to turtlesurvival.org, the website for the Turtle Survival Alliance. A worthy <br/>
organization of turtle specialists who, four years ago, organized the rescue of <br/>
over 4,000 turtles confiscated from illegal dealers in Asia.<br/>
