for letterboxing but I hope to return next month. I carried a box <br/>
hoping to plant in Lancaster county but there was no public land <br/>
around the farm area we were in and I just didn't find the right <br/>
spot. We were on a very harried schedule and darkness falls way to <br/>
early these months so maybe next trip.  Leader of the Pack and Cowboy<br/>

P.s. have a gathering we just might be able to come!<br/>
