A FISHY TALE<br/>
I was surprised to learn that many folks do not know that fish climb <br/>
ladders . What<br/>
surprised me more, is that there is a fish ladder right off I95 in <br/>
Niantic.!! Who would have<br/>
thought I could tell a fish story so interesting.?? But to read about it <br/>
and see it is more<br/>
interesting and you can do that as you watch the water flow in the fish <br/>
way and also hunt<br/>
up The FISH TALE Letterbox.<br/>
You can get to the Latimer Brook Fishway only one way !!<br/>
In Niantic , find the intersection of rte 1 and rte 161 called the <br/>
Flanders section of East<br/>
Lyme. Travel easterly on rte 1 a Very Very short way. As the guard rails <br/>
end, notice a dirt<br/>
parking area on your right as I 95 zooms along close by. Pull into the <br/>
dirt parking lot ,<br/>
large enough for many cars, as this is a busy place with fish watchers.<br/>
Go read the sign and learn about the fishway. Now walk over the wooden <br/>
bridge that<br/>
spans the ladder. A picnic table on the little point is fun to visit and <br/>
maybe have a snack.<br/>
Back on the bridge standing right over the fish way, take a reading of <br/>
60 degrees. Notice a<br/>
large leaning tree about 100 feet, or so ?? Make your way there walking <br/>
over the<br/>
woodchips and down to that tree, due north about 10 feet in the arms of <br/>
the tree roots<br/>
is The Fish Tale Letterbox. Please stamp and cover carefully, this is a <br/>
popular spot .<br/>
Notice both arms of the tree roots have rocks put to fool the <br/>
unsuspecting !!<br/>
Enjoy the thrill of the Fish Ladder<br/>
Hope the other post gets fixed soon.<br/>
