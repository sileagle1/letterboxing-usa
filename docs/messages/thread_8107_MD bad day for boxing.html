                    <html><body>Tried to find five boxes today.  Found only two!  <br/>
<br/>
Could not find Side by Side at Northwest Branch - I have no idea if I was even in the right place.  Never saw a JL tree.  Saw a JA tree, but wasn't sure if that was right.  Wandered around a bit and finally gave up.  It was a really pretty hike though!<br/>
Did find the Acorn box - again, lovely hike and pretty stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Could not find Scott's Cove or the new Maydale Nature Center box.  I'm fairly certain I was in the right place for both of these boxes.  I have to say... I find it strange that both of these boxes were placed less than three weeks ago by the same person and I couldn't find either of them.  Hmmmm.... strange!<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, it was still a nice day.  Got a lot of excercise, got cussed out by numerous angry chipmunks and was almost flattened by the Wootton High School Cross Country team.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went to Side-By-Side a few days ago and it was very difficult to stay on <br/>
the path at the beginning.  Not to mention that I forgot my compass (again).  <br/>
But I did make it to the box after a lot of uncertainty.  I almost gave up a <br/>
number of times.  And I also realized that the reason the path is so hard to <br/>
follow over the boulders is that the box planters wanted to guide finders <br/>
along the safest path.  Did you find "BL?"  I didn't, but I did find the <br/>
correct "JL" tree.<br/>
<br/>
I had a similar experience with the new Maydale box.  Although the bamboo <br/>
forest is small, it has a number of paths, any of which could or could not be <br/>
the correct path to the box.  <br/>
<br/>
My advice is to keep pushing your way forward through the parks and look for <br/>
landmarks.  You'll definitly notice the two logs, the "pregnant" tree and the <br/>
flat sandy area for Side-by-Side, and you'll see the footbridge for Maydale.<br/>

Good luck.<br/>
