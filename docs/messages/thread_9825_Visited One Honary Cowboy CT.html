I thought we would go check on one of my boxes and quickly get this one done. I 
say quickly because I know the area very well and decided to take a short cut. 
The short cut didn't exactly work out but I eventually found the letterbox. 
Leaving the box at dusk. Very unique box, we never did one like that before. 
Kind of gave itÂ it's own little nickname. .....Chuck and
