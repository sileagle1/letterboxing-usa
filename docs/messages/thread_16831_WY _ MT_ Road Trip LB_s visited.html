was very busy and only got to visit 3 LB's all on the way up to MT.<br/>
<br/>
WY Vedauwoo Found 10-15-03- This box is in a great little park!!  Box <br/>
was in awesome condition eventhough one of the bags was not sealed <br/>
all the way.  I was only the 2nd visitor (I think).  First visitor <br/>
only left a stamp image of a small fish.<br/>
<br/>
WY Happy Jack Found 10-15-03- This box was also in great condition as <br/>
I was the first finder!!  I was so excited!!  I did have to wander a <br/>
little bit, but only because I didn't read ALL of the clues!!  This <br/>
is another great spot and a very easy find!!<br/>
<br/>
MT Boulder River Secret Found 10-16-03- This box is in Natural Bridge <br/>
and Falls State Park and is absolutely breathtaking!!  I was so <br/>
intrigued by the park that I locked my keys in my car!!  Luckily <br/>
(literally) there was someone else at the park and we got in without <br/>
having to cause any damage!!  The box was in great condition as I was <br/>
the first finder again!!  Another easy side trip that was very <br/>
welcome after driving through the middle of nowhere!!<br/>
<br/>
Well, that was all I did eventhough I figured I would be the first <br/>
finder of any of the other ones in my path!!  I was tired and so <br/>
excited to spend time with the family.  I will be going back to get <br/>
all those other boxes that were so close yet so far away!!<br/>
