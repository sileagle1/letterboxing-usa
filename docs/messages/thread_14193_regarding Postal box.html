My boyfriend and I are both beginning letterboxers, so can he stamp into it when I receive it as well? If not, let me know and I'll send you his info to add to the list as well, obviously getting him in line behind everyone else who has emailed you so far. :)<br/>

There are so many folks signed up to receive the box, that when it <br/>
comes to you - of course he can stamp in.  Information on all of that <br/>
will come with the box.<br/>
