Samuel P. Taylor State Park<br/>
nearest city: Lagunitas<br/>
(Marin County, CA)<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox series is not *actually* located within the grounds of<br/>
George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch, since that is private property guarded<br/>
carefully by barbed wire, security droids and llamas.   But this<br/>
state park is about 5 miles as the crow flies from the actual ranch. <br/>
This area is very lush and spectacular and may have been the<br/>
inspiration for the forest moon of Endor, from Return of the Jedi. <br/>
I'm fairly certain I spotted a few Ewoks peeking at me from behind<br/>
some of the redwoods while I was on my hike.<br/>
<br/>
May the Force be with you!<br/>
<br/>
planted by PrincessLea on February 26, 2003<br/>
terrain - medium difficulty - somewhat rough dirt/ mud path with some<br/>
uphill climbs (you might try and "borrow" one of those speeder bikes<br/>
from a negligent stormtrooper if you see one)<br/>
rountrip distance - 2.2 miles (trail is a loop)<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  101 freeway exit Sir Francis Drake Blvd. - proceed west<br/>
15 miles.  Inside the park, take the first left to the Visitor<br/>
Center.  There is a day fee of $4.00.  The Pioneer Tree Trail head is<br/>
behind the Redwood Grove Picnic Area.  Take the trail on the right,<br/>
along the creek.<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 - Sardonic Senator<br/>
I have placed information vital to the survival of the rebellion in<br/>
the fallen giant 40 paces back from the first bridge.   Help me Obi<br/>
Wan Letterboxer, you're my only hope.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2 - Dagobah Denizen<br/>
Search for me you must in the small grove of redwoods opposite marker<br/>
#4.  See you the "Anakin" and "Luke" trees 15 steps down the slope. <br/>
Find me you will by Young Skywalker's feet.<br/>
<br/>
Box #3 - Adorable Astromech<br/>
Go past Pioneer Tree (marker #7) and around the hairpin turn.  You<br/>
will walk a ways until there is an unmarked trail on the right.  Take<br/>
the short walk up the hill to a vantage point - there is a large rock<br/>
and you will see the creek far below.  With your back turned to the<br/>
rock, you will see a fallen tree.  If you are on the main trail and<br/>
see a little wooden bridge below the path, you have gone too far.<br/>
<br/>
If you are a hardcore Star Wars fan want to make a pilgrimage to the<br/>
real Skywalker Ranch and gaze at their entrance gate, you can get<br/>
there by taking a left on Nicasio Valley Road off of Sir Francis<br/>
Drake on your way back.  After about 4 miles, there will be a turn<br/>
off to the right for Lucas Valley Road (no, it's not named for<br/>
George).  The gate is about 2 1/2 miles from Nicasio.  For the<br/>
address, and a view of what it looks like beyond the gate, check out<br/>
