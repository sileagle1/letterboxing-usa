I was recently contacted (threw LBNA contact placer) by a reporter <br/>
from my local paper. I say local but by all means not a small paper. <br/>
She's doing a story on LBoxing and wants my help. I haven't <br/>
contacted her yet I'm kind of torn. I learned about LBoxing from an <br/>
article I read so I say why not but at the same time it means more <br/>
publicity and that may bring more vandals. If I do talk to her what <br/>
should I definitely not say? Any help on this would be great.<br/>

I would say go ahead with the interview and story.  Many <br/>
letterboxers have done stories with reporters, and usually it brings <br/>
in new letterboxing fans to join the hobby.  It will also help with <br/>
making the authorites (park rangers, property managers, etc.) more <br/>
understanding that this is an innocent passtime that does not <br/>
threaten their treasured land.<br/>
<br/>
Take them on a letterboxing quest, and let the photographer get some <br/>
good photos.  There are several discussions of interviews on this <br/>
talk list, with ideas of what to say.<br/>
<br/>
The important thing is to ensure that the reporter gets the story <br/>
correct.  Sometimes they don't understand some aspect that they may <br/>
read about on the web site, and write the wrong information in the <br/>
paper.  Ask to review the article before publication.<br/>
<br/>
Tell us about how it came out.  We all want to know.<br/>

<br/>
I found out about letterboxing from a hike leader on her report to the LI <br/>
Greenbelt trail office.  I  was curious so I checked the letterbox site &amp; went <br/>
from there.  <br/>
<br/>
Let the reporters do some research give them the site infomation.  That's all <br/>
they need to know.  Then they can check out a box and maybe do a stamp.  If <br/>
that's too hard, then they  just want you to do their job.<br/>
<br/>
That's my opinion.<br/>
