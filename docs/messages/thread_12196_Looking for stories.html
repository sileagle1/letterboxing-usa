searching for personal stories.  They can be about funny things that <br/>
happened while searching, unique finds, bizarre events or just <br/>
thoughts on the hobby.  Clues also would be welcome, but it might be <br/>
best that they be letterboxes placed by permission since this will be <br/>
in print.    <br/>
<br/>
If you do not mind having it included in the book, please state in <br/>
the email that you are giving me permission to reprint your story.  <br/>
Depending on space only part of it may be used...  I can be reached <br/>
at justplaingeorge@yahoo.com   Please do *not* reply to the list!  <br/>
<br/>
Also, let me know if you prefer your letterboxing name or real name <br/>
to be used.    <br/>
<br/>
I've LOVED some of what I've read on this list and think letterboxing <br/>
adventures would make a great read.    <br/>
<br/>
Please understand that this is not a huge book event.  I am self-<br/>
publishing it primarily for the fun of putting it together and maybe <br/>
introducing a few new people to letterboxing.      <br/>
