Texas Letterboxers Congressional Summit Convention thingie and thanks to a<br/>
case of raging insomnia it looks like that time is now.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I was going to miss meeting everyone because we got off to a late<br/>
start and I'm usually very punctual.  Really.  Honest.  Despite my being an<br/>
hour and a half late Julie, Sheila and Sylvia were still roaming through<br/>
Paper Routes snatching up all the good bargains.  I stocked up on YES glue.<br/>
 I gave up eating paste a long time ago so I swear I don't know how I<br/>
manage to go through so much of this stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't have chosen a nicer bunch of gals to spend an afternoon with.<br/>
And you all were so sweetly tolerant of my very precocious rugrat!  We all<br/>
really enjoyed the visit, the lunch and the book artist's exhibit.  Sheila,<br/>
Jayson is determined to figure out that binding we were pondering.  He got<br/>
close tonite but it's still not quite right.  Mind you, when he sat down to<br/>
work on it that was the first time he's even been near my art desk.  He<br/>
said "what do you do with all this art junk?"  I said "same thing you do<br/>
with all that golf junk."  Taylor said she had a lot of fun with the<br/>
letterboxers (l-e-t-t-e-r-b-o-x-e-r-s...she spells everything) and next<br/>
time she plans to meet at Sylvia's house.  Taylor just latched on to<br/>
Sylvia, they're best buds now.<br/>
<br/>
I had a great time and hope you all invite me back for the next one.  The<br/>
GPS is safely here with me and I have a date with it this weekend if the<br/>
rain stops.<br/>
