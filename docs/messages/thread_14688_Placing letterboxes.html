litterboxes while others think they are OK.<br/>
<br/>
There are many fantastic, but relatively unknown places are exposed to people by<br/>
following letterbox clues.  Some of these places may be remote in location and<br/>
the person who plants the box would love to share this with others.<br/>
<br/>
I personally think that orphan boxes are OK.  If you are concerned about leaving<br/>
a box stranded, you could try looking up clues for other boxes in the area and<br/>
ask the planter of those boxes if they would mind being a caretaker.<br/>
<br/>
It may even be better to ask the person before leaving on the trip to plant the<br/>
boxes to aviod having them orphaned.<br/>

This is like worrying about whether it will rain on your picnic!<br/>
<br/>
If we worried about our boxes becoming orphans, we'd place very few boxes. <br/>
One of our goals is to place a box in a s many states as our little feet can <br/>
carry us! We find that most of these places are ones we would love to return to, <br/>
and often end up doing just that (i.e., Gettysburg, PA, Ashland. OR, Nantucket <br/>
MA). Whenever we read a sit rep from one of our far-away Lbs, we heave a <br/>
happy sigh wishing we were there, and sit back enjoying the fact that we brought a <br/>
little fun into some boxer's life.<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is, never let this be a reason to NOT place a box. If there's a <br/>
problem in the future, you'll figure out a way to deal with it. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On a trip to the east coast last year I placed a few letterboxes, <br/>
hoping that somebody would find them, since there wasn't much <br/>
letterboxing activity in my state at the time.  It seemed like a good <br/>
idea at the time and it is nice to hear from far-away folks who have <br/>
found one of the boxes.<br/>
<br/>
But...  on the flip side, it is frustrating to get reports that the <br/>
box was not found and may be missing and not have the ability to <br/>
check on it.  I am fortunate that in some of these places I have made <br/>
other letterboxing contacts and can ask somebody to check on the box <br/>
for me.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I feel that when you plant a letterbox, there is some <br/>
responsibility for maintaining it and keeping tabs on the status.  <br/>
And since I am not able to do this with boxes I place while away, I <br/>
will be thinking hard before placing any new boxes while on vacation <br/>
or traveling.<br/>

Just my 2 cents...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; One of our goals is to place a box in a s many states as our <br/>
little feet can <br/>
&gt; carry us! We find that most of these places are ones we would love <br/>
to return to, <br/>
&gt; and often end up doing just that (i.e., Gettysburg, PA, Ashland. <br/>
OR, Nantucket <br/>
&gt; MA). &gt; <br/>
<br/>
Nantucket!?  My hometown!  I am traveling there in a couple of weeks <br/>
and plan to plant a couple in some off the beaten path niches.  I <br/>
have a father-in-law and a couple of good friends that I hope to <br/>
recruit as extended families to my boxes there.  <br/>
<br/>
The only sad thing is that I know my best friend there will love <br/>
this hobby yet she hardly ever leaves the island.  Her boxing <br/>
opportunities will definitely be limited! <br/>
<br/>
I have found six Nantucket plants.  I don't see one with your name <br/>
on it.  I see Mike S has been there and Lonemasswolf and Rustypuff.<br/>
<br/>
Is yours a mystery? :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing,<br/>

<br/>
WHen I first heard about LB'ing (in 2001), I planted several in neat places during my travels for work.<br/>
<br/>
I've had several reports of missing or wet boxes. These boxes are in Oklahoma.  Since I'm in PA and unable to do maintenance, I have decided to only plant where I can check on boxes at least yearly if not more often.  (I had asked the folks reporting the problems if they could "adopt", but they were passing through and were not able).<br/>
<br/>
So, if you can believe it, I am planning a trip to Oklahoma JUST TO CHECK ON MY LETTERBOXES!!!! sheesh! <br/>
<br/>
So, I agree with others who suggest NOT planting unless you or someone can maintain the LB's.<br/>
