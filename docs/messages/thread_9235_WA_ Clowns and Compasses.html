                    <div class="plaintext-content">A funny thing happened to me the other day.  I headed out to Fort <br/>
Steilacoom Park to nab the last of the clowns there, and you'd never <br/>
guess what I found at the last one:  A compass!  Looked suspiciously <br/>
like a compass I've seen before, and sure enough, the owner (Amanda <br/>
from Seattle!) fessed up to "misplacing" it five days earlier when <br/>
she was there.  She just thought it was misplaced somewhere in all <br/>
her junk!  =)<br/>
<br/>
So how do the stats work if you've "found" a compass?  =)  Does it <br/>
count as a hitchhiker since they typically do move from box to box?  <br/>
(Not that they actually stay there, but they do move around!)<br/>
<br/>
And, speaking of the clown clues, there's a new fense that's been put <br/>
up around the cemetary, so you can't stand right at the sign for one <br/>
of the boxes where the clue mentions to take a compass direction.  <br/>
Well, you're not supposed to, at least.<br/>
<br/>
Adios!<br/>
