If you take your image (or images) to Kinko's or use a 'professional'<br/>
copier, the transfer works better. I think it's because those machines use a<br/>
heat transfer process and most home printers don't use that kind of ink.<br/>
I like that it gives you as crisp an image as you see on the paper (hard to<br/>
get with carbon paper tracing). I've also seen people recommend acetone, but<br/>
I haven't tried it myself.<br/>

&gt;Use any ink jet printer, set on black, and a HOT iron (just like<br/>
&gt;making T-Shirts).<br/>
<br/>
The part about the hot iron is certainly something I haven't tried.<br/>
Are you talking about printing onto plain paper, or something else?<br/>
<br/>

<div><span class="509584516-19012003">I read 
some instructions somewhere on the web saying to use a laser printer and 
acetone, but all I had was a deskjet printer and non-acetone nailpolish remover. 
I just used a cottonbud soaked in the remover and rubbed the back of the paper. 
The image transferred flawlessly with no running or smudging. The image was a 
line drawing - I don't know if it would work as well if there were large dark 
areas to transfer.</span></div>
