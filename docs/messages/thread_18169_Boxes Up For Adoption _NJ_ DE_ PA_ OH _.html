                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have decided to put my out-of-state letterboxes up for adoption.  I <br/>
am not giving up the game, just feel that they need better care than <br/>
I can provide them.<br/>
<br/>
I've gone back and forth on this issue and I know there has been <br/>
discussion on this list from time to time regarding places boxes <br/>
while on vacation.  Based on my own experience as a box-owner with <br/>
out-state boxes and a letterboxer seeking/finding missing and <br/>
unmaintained boxes with out-state owners, I've decided not to place <br/>
boxes in faraway places in the future and am hoping that the out-<br/>
state boxes I have previously placed will be adopted by local boxers <br/>
who can give them some TLC and maintain them for all to enjoy into <br/>
the future.<br/>
<br/>
I struggled with the best way to go about this -- contact specific <br/>
people and ask or post to the list, etc.  Not wanting anyone to feel <br/>
obligation, I decided to post to the list and ask for interested <br/>
parties to repond to me by private e-mail -- not to the list, <br/>
please.  Ideally I am looking for people who live near the box they <br/>
are offering to adopt, have previously found the box and have played <br/>
an active role in letterboxing in their area.  I don't want to play <br/>
favorites, but these are my babies and understandably I am much more <br/>
comfortable releasing them into the care of people I recognize and <br/>
have had previous contact with.  However, that is not an engraved-in-<br/>
stone condition -- just depends on the box and the interest.<br/>
<br/>
There are a handful of boxes, in NJ(4), DE(2), PA(1), OH(1).  Please <br/>
see my web site for specific boxes/locations and contact me privately <br/>
if you are interested in taking on the responsibility for any of <br/>
these boxes.<br/>
