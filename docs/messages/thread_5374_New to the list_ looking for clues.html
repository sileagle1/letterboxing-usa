This weekend we are driving from Rochester NY to near Elmira NY and <br/>
would love to have a little diversion on the way, weather permitting.<br/>

Later this summer, I'm traveling from Rochester, thru Ontario Canada, <br/>
to Lansing MI, then up along Rt 23 from Saginaw Bay to Mackinaw City, <br/>
then along the north shore of Lake Michigan to Escanaba, then on to <br/>
Madison WI. Anything along the way there would be great to check out <br/>
too.<br/>

<br/>
Not sure if Ithaca, NY is in or out of your way, but<br/>
there are boxes at Sapsucker Woods (just north of<br/>
Ithaca off NY Route 13), a gem of a spot where<br/>
Cornell's Ornithology Lab is located, and Cornell<br/>
Plantations on campus. Check the letterboxing.org site<br/>
for clues. Enjoy!<br/>
