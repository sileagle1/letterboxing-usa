hmmm I dunno... Maybe you should think this through before talking to any<br/>
officials. Having not been there I cannot say what actually did happen, but<br/>
I would *guess* that there was more to it, such as something happened<br/>
locally that had people sharp-eyed to unusual things, or perhaps some vibe<br/>
that onlookers or authorities sensed when watching the LBers sleuthing<br/>
around.  Perhaps someone else's kids were running wild around there or going<br/>
near people's cars, or there had been reported theft(s)? It could have been<br/>
something as simple as someone backing a boat to the ramp being nervous<br/>
about children walking around the area unattended.<br/>
<br/>
IIRC, the state DEM has the authority to clearly define the use of it lands<br/>
under its juristriction, and could easily confiscate the box and/or ban the<br/>
activity in areas designated for fishing only.  Also, IIRC, that area is<br/>
posted as no parking except for uses as outlined (shellfishing, loading<br/>
boats), and *even though* many people break this rule, it *is* enforceable.<br/>
The area is the breachway at Quonochontaug.<br/>
<br/>
I personally know both of these people, and they are very nice. Perhaps CZF<br/>
would have been better off just claiming that she or her kids had lost<br/>
something, like jewelry or a Frisbee, because it sure would have sounded<br/>
more plausable. And if they did accuse her of not watching her kids, it<br/>
would make sense to tell them that she had her kids all spread out because<br/>
they all know what to look for. <shrug> Sometimes the truth isn't what<br/>
people need to be told, IMHO.  It's not necessarily that we need to teach<br/>
our children to lie, per se, but perhaps to leave the talking to Mom or Dad<br/>
and let the adult decide what to say or how much discretion is required.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really interested in talking to CZF in person to hear her side of the<br/>
story.  And yes, she is "legally blind" and yet can still drive legally,<br/>
with her dark shades during the day.  I'm sure this raises questions and<br/>
suspicions for some, but I'm also sure that she would not be careless or<br/>
cavalier about her children's safety.<br/>
