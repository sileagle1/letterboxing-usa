                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I set out to get a box in the DEP forestry series that the clues said <br/>
was only about 300 feet from the car.  Even though the road wasn't plowed (and <br/>
neither was the parking lot) I decided to give it a shot.<br/>
<br/>
I walked around the mound of logs and rocks that the DEP used as a landmark <br/>
in the beginning of the hike, and to my right on the ground was a rib cage.  <br/>
Seriously, unmistakeably, a rib cage.  And I'm not talking about a raccoon.  The <br/>
first thought that I had was that it was probably only a matter of time <br/>
before I stumbled on a dead body, considering how much time I spend in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
I freaked out for a minute before examining it (from a safe distance) and <br/>
realized that it couldn't have been human, from the way it was shaped.  It was <br/>
probably a deer, or even a wolf or something.  But not human.<br/>
<br/>
So if you're venturing into Nye-Holman anytime soon for their DEP box, be <br/>
forewarned.  It's right on the other side of the mound.  And it's not human.  <br/>
Just so you don't pass out like I almost did!<br/>

eeewwwwwww.<br/>
<br/>
When we went to scout out places to plant the two Deacon Winslow boxes, I had <br/>
spotted what I thought was a perfect hiding place, but I had spotted it from <br/>
a distance.  A couple of weeks later when I went to place the box, I still <br/>
wasn't looking very closely, and I just casually reached down to move some debris <br/>
away from the hole.  Suddenly I realized I had a raccoon skull, jaw, teeth, <br/>
in my hands.  Not a pleasant experience.  The rest of the skeleton was on the <br/>
ground.<br/>
<br/>
It *had* been a blissfully quiet, rather mundane day up to that point.  After <br/>
I recovered, we found another hiding place. <br/>

Ah, guys?  You do realize that you're supposed to put the letterbox<br/>
where it won't be casually found by a non-boxer?  A hole covered by a<br/>
racoon corpse???  I'd have called it the perfect spot! <br/>

Oh, in this neck of the woods, it would be found by <br/>
non-boxers.............just maybe not the sort one would want to know.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
*Would* make a heckuva first finder gift though.  A <br/>
Make-Your-Own-Tooth-&amp;-Bone-Necklace kit.   <br/>
