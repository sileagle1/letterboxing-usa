     I am new to letterboxing and I just moved to NM and was <br/>
wondering if anyone knows of any boxes down here?!! We are in <br/>
Ruidoso, but we would travel to be able to do some boxing!!:-) Are <br/>
there any organizations in this area or are we one of those places we <br/>
need to get some interest going?<br/>
                                 Thanks much!!<br/>

can check it out A.S.A.P! I guess I will have to get<br/>

hide boxes for each other! Thanks much for the<br/>

He used to have them on the old site.  I wrote and explained the <br/>
change in how boxes were listed to him, but he never got his <br/>
complete boxes on the site, only partial ones.  Plant some more <br/>
boxes for me and it may just lure me out there again (I have <br/>
family in that area and try to make it down on occasion.<br/>
