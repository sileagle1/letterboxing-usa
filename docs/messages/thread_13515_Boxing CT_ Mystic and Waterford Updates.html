were short-walk oriented boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Tried for the Olde Mystick Village box last night but they are not <br/>
on summer hours yet, so they are open 10a-6p for a bit more. Soon <br/>
will be open till 8pm. Went back this morning for opening and found <br/>
that Wanda And Pete nailed yet another first find, however we're the <br/>
second ones logged in! Neat place for a box, bring a fist full of <br/>
cash and browse afterwards though!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday was Waterford Town Beach in the lovely afternoon sun! Got <br/>
the first 2 boxes in the series and did not try for # 3 seeing that <br/>
it was listed as missing. #2 is missing an ink pad, but no big deal <br/>
since most CT boxers bring their own...  Almost went to Harkness but <br/>
realized its $3 to get in and I had a mere dollar bill to my name! <br/>
lol<br/>
<br/>
Heidi and I went for a ride after trying mystic last night. Checked <br/>
on the Captain's Walk, and some other local boxes... all in good <br/>
shape, dry, and some activity. <br/>

Music Woman, congrats on 700... sure you have it by now. We're <br/>
closing in on F100 this week... <br/>
