Yes! I agree that discovering new places and just simply enjoying <br/>
nature is the most rewarding part of letterboxing... for me.<br/>

other day something happened to us on a trail that i never seen <br/>
before.their was a fawn,well a yearling it still had some fadded <br/>
spots on it right in the middle of the path.i bent over and leaned <br/>
forward and walked and talked real soft right up to it.i could not <br/>
believe it,i stretched out my arm and he stretched his neck and i <br/>
almost touched his nose but my canteen slipped off my shoulder and <br/>
down my arm and off he went.it was almost like a petting zoo but no <br/>
cage it was great and it's something we'll never forget.the stamps <br/>
are great carved or not but so is discovering new places and meeting <br/>
nice people.  P.S coming soon Fawn in the forest letterbox lol.<br/>
