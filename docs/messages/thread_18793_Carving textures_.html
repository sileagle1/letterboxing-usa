I'm working on a series of boxes that need a 'rough texture' carved <br/>
into portions of the stamps to really make the most effective <br/>
image.  I've been playing with the idea, and so far haven't really <br/>
come up with a good solution.  Most of the time, of course, it's <br/>
either 'ink or no ink'.  I realize it's a natural limitation of the <br/>
art but that's never stopped me from experimenting before.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
If anyone out there has accomplished this, I'd be grateful for a tip <br/>
or trick.  I'm looking for a technique that makes something <br/>
look 'gravely without direction', for lack of a better term, like <br/>
sand as an example.<br/>
<br/>
Just trying to expand my technique.  Any suggestions would be <br/>
appreciated!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A few things I have used for texture and/or shading that have worked <br/>
with varied degrees of success are:<br/>
<br/>
* sandpaper (easier on larger areas)<br/>
<br/>
* needles -- use different sized sewing needles (paper clips and <br/>
other pointy objects also work) and poke closely spaced holes in the <br/>
carving material in the area you want shaded.  You need to <br/>
experiment with the effects -- size of needles, how deep, how dense, <br/>
etc. but this seems to work well for me in most cases.<br/>
<br/>
* cross-hatching -- I learned this one from Ruthann Zaroff, a very <br/>
talented carver and veteran Michigan letterboxer who has kind of <br/>
dropped out of sight the past year -- using the Speedball #1 blade <br/>
(small "V"), lightly drag the tip over the area to be shaded in <br/>
closely spaced rows first one way and then perpendicular to these <br/>
lines.  This works best if you work the technique on the area you <br/>
want shaded before you carve away around it, and the effect is <br/>
dependent on the amount of pressure you apply while dragging -- too <br/>
litte and it is not very distinct, too much and you risk taking out <br/>
pieces of the carving material.  But it is a nice look when you "get <br/>
it" just right.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
