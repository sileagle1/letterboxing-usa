Letterbox Name: Possum Hollow and Coon Creek(two boxes<br/>
Location: GA, Canton, Cherokee County USA<br/>
Difficulty: Moderate...trail is a bit steep in places, but footing is<br/>
secure. Boxes are not difficult to find.<br/>
Date Planted: August 12th and 19th, 2002 <br/>
Planted by :Jimmus and Charliedog <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:<br/>
<br/>
This is a relatively easy hike. Your main difficulty may be in<br/>
getting to the starting point...New Hightower Church and Cemetery on<br/>
Old Shoal Creek Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Try these directions. Get off I-575 at the exit which is to Ga 140<br/>
west. This will take you across the bridge where you would turn in to<br/>
Boling Park were you to walk the Etowah trail. Continue on past<br/>
Cherokee High School on your left, on over and down the hill to the<br/>
intersection which has CVS Pharmacy on the right. A Walgreen<br/>
drugstore is presently being constructed on the left.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left and in a few yards, just past the Cherokee Medical Building<br/>
on your left, Old Shoal Creek Road goes off at about a 45 degree<br/>
angle. Take that road.<br/>
You will continue on the road until it ends at New Hightower Church<br/>
some three miles away. Bear left at all forks of the road, do not<br/>
turn right into any subdivision road. Somewhere along the way, the<br/>
road name changes to Old Shoal Creek Trail.<br/>
<br/>
With persistence you will arrive at the Church.. You can park in the<br/>
area on the right, at the end of the road.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the pavement, two metal posts and a cable block passage<br/>
to a cleared area beyond. There is a nice muddy area at the cable<br/>
gate where you may see possum, coon, rabbit, squirrel, dog, coyote,<br/>
fox, or human tracks...not all of them, of course, but even one<br/>
animal track is an adventure!<br/>
<br/>
Several trails and old roads come into the clearing beyond the cable<br/>
gate. To get on the correct trail, do this: <br/>
<br/>
Go to the left gate post. From the gate post walk 200 degrees for 12<br/>
paces, then 125 degrees for 30 paces. This should put you at the<br/>
beginning of the Etowah Trail. This is the end of the trail that<br/>
leaves Boling Park if you walk the trail to the Etowah Chief and<br/>
Woodland Meadow letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
As you start the trail, you will note a generic "No hunting,<br/>
shooting, tresspassing" sign posted on a tree, and above it a sign<br/>
posted by a hunting club. The club's sign suggests that you wear<br/>
bright colors when walking through the woods during hunting season. I<br/>
suggest it at all times since it would be easier to find a person,<br/>
should they become disabled, if they are wearing bright colors.<br/>
<br/>
To the best of my knowledge, the trails and roads are not posted. The<br/>
trails and roads are heavily used by walkers and mountain bike<br/>
riders. You will not be required to get far off the trail to get to<br/>
either of these letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after you begin your hike, you will pass a large growth of<br/>
"ground cedar". This is a primitive vascular plant that is also known<br/>
as a "club moss" though mosses are nonvascular. Look closely and you<br/>
should be able to see the spore-producing "clubs" that grow above the<br/>
plants.<br/>
<br/>
As you continue on the path, you encounter a sign post which points<br/>
the way to Boling Park and also to a longer loop trail. Continue on<br/>
toward Boling Park, and the path now goes downhill.<br/>
<br/>
A wooden bridge crosses a small stream. Go to the end of the bridge,<br/>
but do not cross it. WELCOME TO POSSUM HOLLOW!<br/>

<br/>
But first learn a bit about these delightful creatures <br/>
<br/>
Opossums are marsupials. The young are born at a very immature stage<br/>
when they are about the size of a honeybee. The rear legs are not<br/>
developed. The young crawl from the area around the genitalia up to<br/>
the pouch where they can get milk. More young are born than there are<br/>
nipples to nourish them...some simply get lost along the way. Life is<br/>
tough for possums.<br/>
<br/>
They are also a very common road kill in my area of north Georgia. <br/>
This has led to a joke, perhaps a bit sick (??):  "Why did the<br/>
chicken cross the road?"<br/>
Answer: "To show the possum that it could be done!"<br/>
<br/>
Now for the letterbox:<br/>
