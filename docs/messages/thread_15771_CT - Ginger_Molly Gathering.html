It is great to see and visit with the people that we only "see/meet" on the trails through their stamps.  Carolyn and I both agree that this hobby has enabled us to see and experience parts of New England that we would normally not see, and Goodwin State Forest is indeed beautiful.   And, of course meet this great group of people.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again Chuck and Chickabirdie and all the help you had to make the day great.<br/>
