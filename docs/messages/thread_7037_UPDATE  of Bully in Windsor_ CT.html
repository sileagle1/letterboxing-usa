morning and he is well.  However, there is some trail construction in <br/>
the path.  You can walk around the orange plastic fencing to reach <br/>
him.  Hopefully in a week or two they will be done with the work <br/>
there.  So please try again.  We will also keep a watchful eye on his <br/>
safety. Thanks for the tip!  Happy trails :)  <br/>

planted by Rebecca. There is alot of construction on that site so I <br/>
don't know if it is missing or was it pulled. Of course it could be <br/>
that we just missed it.<br/>
