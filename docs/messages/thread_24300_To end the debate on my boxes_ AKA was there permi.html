                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, according to Kim's final word "No, I don't want any different stamps<br/>
or clues out there for my<br/>
boxes. You are more than welcome to plant boxes in the same parks,<br/>
but I don't want mine taken over like that."  It seems quite clear that her<br/>
boxes were not available for adoption.<br/>
<br/>
What does confuse me is that when Richard first asked, Kim's response was<br/>
"And exactly what would that entail?"  Perhaps she just thought he was<br/>
asking if he could do maintenance?<br/>
<br/>
Kim was made aware that her boxes needed attention.  Apparently she decided<br/>
to not do maintenance or to get it done in her own time.  That is certainly<br/>
her option.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, if all this is correct info (seems to be, directly quoted<br/>
emails from Kim), then she said no.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that perhaps would have helped is if Kim also had emailed<br/>
lb.org and let them know that she was saying no.  Perhaps she did that, I<br/>
don't know.<br/>
