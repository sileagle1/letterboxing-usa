I guess there are others but the two compass companies that<br/>
are the most recognized would be Suunto and Silva. Suunto has<br/>
done such a neat graphics job on there web site that you can't<br/>
find anything easily. Don't get me wrong, they make an excellent <br/>
compass and I happen to own one it's just that they really messed<br/>
up there site. <br/>
<br/>
Silva on the other hand is easy to find and get an explanation of<br/>
what your buying. The site will even tell you a little about how<br/>
to use the darn thing. The price range for a reasonable beginners<br/>
compass is from $10 to $20 depending on what you buy.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to LetterboxCentral.com you will find a link to SILVA<br/>
Compass under the Equipment section. You will also find a link<br/>
to "Compass 101" a tutorial, under the "Resource Section".<br/>

I hope this has helped - It's why we started LetterboxingCentral<br/>
in the first place.<br/>
