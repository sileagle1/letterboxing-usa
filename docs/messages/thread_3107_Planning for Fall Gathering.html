                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, Oct 6 is the Saturday of Columbus Day weekend.  In the original <br/>
poll I indicated that it was a 3day weekend.  I know that a few <br/>
people have conflicts but hopefully most will be able to attend. <br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to get an indication from everyone how they want the <br/>
planning handled.  I know that many people who read the list will not <br/>
be able to come and probably don't want to sift through lots of <br/>
postings about something they have little interest in.  Here are some <br/>
of our options:<br/>
<br/>
1) Continue to do all planning via postings on this egroup.<br/>
2) Establish a new egroup only for the planning, open to all for <br/>
posting and reading.<br/>
3) Establish an email list for those who plan to come and copy all in <br/>
the group for every message.<br/>
<br/>
My personal preference would be 2) in consideration for those that <br/>
are not coming.  I know some people on the list have limited internet <br/>
access and may not care to read 30 postings on one food suggestion <br/>
vs. another.  That way anyone who is not coming but is interested <br/>
will have the option of checking out the other egroup.  The down <br/>
side, of course, is that those of us who are will have to check two <br/>
different egroups (or just sign up for the daily digest).  Let me <br/>
know what your preferences are.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

We hope to camp at Burlingame for a night or two. We'll stake out a <br/>
bunch of nice campsites early if others are thinking the same <br/>
(they're first-come, first-served).<br/>

We could do a pasta or chili thing for the group, and will have a <br/>

available.<br/>

Looking forward to seeing everyone!<br/>

OK, now for my deep, dark secret.  The only way you can reserve ahead <br/>
is if you get a camping cabin.  We have camped there for Columbus Day <br/>
weekend off and on for several years now and though we usually have <br/>
fair weather, last year it was in the 30's at night.  Brrr!  We <br/>
wimped out and got a cabin this year (#99)!  BTW, at Burlingame they <br/>
assign you campsites so when you get there so you have to say that <br/>
you are meeting friends and they are staying at the "Fish Camp."  If <br/>
you give them a name they will put you by that person.  <br/>
