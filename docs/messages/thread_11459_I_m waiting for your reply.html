I'm so happy to see people from around the world voicing their opinions.  <br/>
Don't be discouraged by the negative responses you get from a lot of these <br/>
letterboxing folks.  (They tend to be a conservative bunch.)  But know that <br/>
there are many Americans out there who agree with you.  I went to a peace <br/>
rally recently and there were people there from all walks of life--all ages, <br/>
professions, ethnic backgrounds, etc.  We were all there for the same reason <br/>
and the sense of unity was wonderful.  We were a microcosm of America, as <br/>
America is a microcosm of the world.  Keep up the good work!<br/>
