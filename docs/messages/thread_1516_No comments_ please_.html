                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, I want to thank Eric Mings for his generous offer to provide <br/>
new services for our group. However, I have some strong objections to posting <br/>
comments about letterboxes on a public database.<br/>
<br/>
Like Randy, I have also had people report my boxes as missing when, in fact, <br/>
they were just more of a challenge than the hunter-in-question was up to. <br/>
Providing a permanent home for such mistaken comments would discourage others <br/>
from hunting for valid boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Not to say that boxes don't come up missing, for I have experienced that <br/>
situation on several occasions. Unfortunately, I'm afraid that the misguided <br/>
types who get a kick out of stealing or defacing letterboxes will get an even <br/>
bigger kick out of seeing their misdeeds published on the Internet. This <br/>
might actually ENCOURAGE letterbox theft.<br/>
<br/>
As a rule, when my boxes come up missing, I eventually replace them. <br/>
Sometimes I move them a bit and/or change the clues slightly. Other times I <br/>
have simply put a new box in its place.  The ongoing list of comments that <br/>
could result from a box that has disappeared and reappeared periodically <br/>
might become confusing enough to discourage people from looking for it <br/>
altogether, even though it is currently a valid letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I share Randy's concern that people might abuse the comments feature by <br/>
inserting hints and spoilers that would take away from the challenge and <br/>
mystique.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I would like to suggest that the most important thing about a <br/>
letterbox is not the box or the stamp or the logbook.  The coolest thing is <br/>
that someone has written a set of clues that lead to a private little hiding <br/>
place in the wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
Let's say I have gone to the effort to follow the clues and am convinced that <br/>
I have found the original hiding place, but there is no letterbox there.  <br/>
Who's to say that I can't replace the box there and then, if I am so inclined <br/>
and properly prepared?  I would even go so far as to say that this might be <br/>
the most acceptable thing to do in such cases.  Granted, the stamp I leave <br/>
behind may be a very crude field-carved one, or even a cheap store-bought <br/>
one, but at least the next person to follow the clues will find some reward <br/>
for their efforts.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, there is no REAL way of knowing whether there is a box out <br/>
there or not... short of leaving your computer behind and trekking out to the <br/>
location in person. If this hobby is going to persevere, despite thieves and <br/>
vandals, we are going to have to show some determination... and maybe even a <br/>
bit of innovation and creativity.<br/>
