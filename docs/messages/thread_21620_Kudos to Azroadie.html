We had received a very descriptive "could not find" message several <br/>
months ago, from an unnamed letterboxer. We retired the Page Springs <br/>
Fish Hatchery Letterbox in Arizona. This month Azroadie decided to try <br/>
for this letterbox, and found it right where it should be. Had it been <br/>
local and not an orphan we would have done a double check on the box, <br/>
but since we were not in the area we had retired it instead.It is back <br/>
on the LBNA site as well as AQ.<br/>
