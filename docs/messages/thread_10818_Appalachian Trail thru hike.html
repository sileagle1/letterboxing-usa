This certainly is an ambitious project! I for one look forward to <br/>
finding some of those stamps! (also there are a bunch of stamps along <br/>
sections of the trail already)<br/>

&gt; I'm looking into hiking the Appalachian Trail!  I only got the idea <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; couple of weeks back but took to it like a fish in water.  <br/>
According <br/>
&gt; to my "sources", the typical thru-hiker is thinking about the hike <br/>
&gt; for ten YEARS before starting the adventure, so I've got some <br/>
serious <br/>
&gt; catching up to do!  But wow, what an adventure!  Over 2,000 miles <br/>
&gt; from Georgia to Maine and through 12 other states, on foot.  They <br/>
say <br/>
&gt; the elevation gain of all the hills adds up to climbing Mt Everest <br/>
&gt; from sea level to the top 16 times!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I'm thinking of creating a letterboxing series along the entire <br/>
&gt; route.  The world's longest letterboxing chain.  I'm thinking <br/>
perhaps <br/>
&gt; a letterbox every 20 to 25 miles sounds good (which adds up to <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; 100 letterboxes!)  That might be a little too ambitious, though, <br/>
&gt; since I'll probably be too tired to carve a new stamp virtually <br/>
every <br/>
&gt; day.  Unless I can pre-carve most of them before I hit the trail, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; that's still a lot of stamps to be carving!  And since Internet <br/>
&gt; access is limited when you're miles away from the nearest <br/>
&gt; civilization, I might not even have a chance to type in all the <br/>
clues <br/>
&gt; for a hundred boxes along the way.  But it's a dream of mine.  =)  <br/>
A <br/>
&gt; series that stretches for over 2,000 miles along the east coast.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And if I'm REALLY lucky, I'll finally get a chance to meet a bunch <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; you east coast folks I've always heard stories about and swap e-<br/>
mails <br/>
&gt; with all the time!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But gosh, that's my next BIG adventure I'm thinking about.  My feet <br/>
&gt; are sore just thinking about the trip, but my spirits are high!  =)<br/>

So bravo Ryan - we'll all live vicariously through you while you're on the trail.  Plus you'll have all those sharp carving tools with you to defend yourself against the bears.<br/>

trail.  *rolling eyes*<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Plus you'll have all those sharp carving tools with you to defend<br/>
&gt; yourself against the bears.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen a fair number of bears over the year and they don't concern <br/>
me in the least.  Most of them run away as soon as they hear the <br/>
camera go "click!".  Bunch of frady cats.  Even the rattlesnakes <br/>
don't concern me much--I've seen lots of those on the trails over the <br/>
years.  It's the animals I'm NOT familiar with like Copperheads that <br/>
conern me most!  I figure it's mostly a fear of the unknown and are <br/>
probably as harmless as bears and rattlesnakes (which in my <br/>
experience, have been pretty harmless!)<br/>
<br/>
But I'll always keep that #1 nib out to fend off those snakes and <br/>
bears--just in case.  ;o)<br/>
