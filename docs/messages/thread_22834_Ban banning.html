surprised to hear that was the course of action taken in this case.<br/>

The whole idea of banning is kind of pointless as the banned user can <br/>
easily rejoin with a new name, as was done in this situation.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I have been off list for some time, but decided to go back over the <br/>
last several days in the archive. I realize that the message, that <br/>
caused the banning  could have been removed, but didn't see much on <br/>
the list that could be considered "that" offensive. If it <br/>
was "putting SpringChick in her place", then maybe this ban was a <br/>
little hasty. That post was so far out of line that it was <br/>
laughable, not banable. I didn't see anything that was nasty to the <br/>
point of tossing someone. Several posts could be considered stupid, <br/>
inconsiderate, poorly thought out, but if that was the criteria then <br/>
why only one gets the boot? While I'm not in favor of elimination of <br/>
banning, I certainly think there should be a pretty high standard <br/>
that should be reached for such an action. Being stupid and <br/>
inconsiderate may not reach that standard. People that can not <br/>
discuss a topic civily are in the end their own worst enemy as their <br/>
point of view gets lost in their emotional responses, and is posted <br/>
for the entire list to see. Those responses that are poorly written <br/>
reflect on the writer, and not necessarily on the subject at hand. <br/>
We all should have the right to look stupid if our posts come across <br/>
that way. If there is a new letterboxer posting on this list, and <br/>
taking a point of view that is away from the norm why not answer the <br/>
question and then refer him or her to the Newboxers list and various <br/>
sites that pertain to the subject? Let them research the answer <br/>
themselves.<br/>

 I am not for banning anyone but sometimes we have people who do<br/>
not play by the rules (Rules being all of us) A guy in the Geocaching world<br/>
"Dreagon" here in Cincinnati, one day did not get his way. After being upset<br/>
at Mark the sysop of a website, (He Waited till Mark) left for Iraq, Then he <br/>
went after his wife and ended up calling her a (B) in a public! fourm. (Not in a Private E-Mail) But where everyone could read it.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say NO ONE was happy with him. And were sure when Mark<br/>
comes home he will want to talk about this with him  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
 Sometimes we have people like this where you have no choice but to ban them. <br/>
You give them chance after chance (As we did. We had 4 different people talk to<br/>
him) and he just kept it up. When does it end, When everyone gets sick of it and<br/>
finds another hobby all over one person?<br/>
<br/>
 Sometimes you have to take that next step and do away with the problem so<br/>
the hobby can be fun to the whole. BUT! I think we should all vote on it. Dreagon<br/>
was put to a vote and after a 62-1 vote to ban him, it was done. Also if<br/>
he comes forward and says he sorry the ban will be lifted. I know no one<br/>
wants to ban anyone but no one wants to logon to trash talk. Your in the hobby<br/>
to feel good and find a box in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
I also do not think a few people should have the power to ban someone but the group as a whole  should. The group can act as a safe guard. It's easy to make a <br/>
few people mad but it's really hard to make a whole group mad. (62-1) It's a<br/>
good bet that the person is/was a jerk and the group is better off without<br/>
that problem.<br/>
<br/>
 Oh well, Just my two cents on Banning someone.<br/>
