7 more letterbox stamps have been added. We now have a total<br/>
of 110 stamps for the event plus however many out of town stamps<br/>
have been sent in. We also need everyone's help in getting the word<br/>
out about this event. Next year we are going to have a Midwest<br/>
letterboxing event and we will need a lot of help to do it. This<br/>
event will help us see what will be needed to have an event of<br/>
grand scale. The Date and and place of the event will be coming<br/>
at the end of June.<br/>

If you can not make this event but like to be here anyway, Just<br/>
carve a stamp and send it to us. We will have a table set up<br/>
where people can stamp up your stamp. SWOGO will give you a<br/>
log ook where letterboxers can place their personal stamps in<br/>
and will sent it all back to you after the event. All you need<br/>
to do is send your stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Here is the address to send your stamp to. PLEASE make sure you <br/>
send in all the information about your stamp.(I E your letterboxing <br/>
team name and you address to send it back to)<br/>
