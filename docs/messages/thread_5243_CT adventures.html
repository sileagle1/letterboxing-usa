Yesterday was a perfect day for being outside here in New England, so JLR <br/>
and I had a looooong day of adventures.  First, we tackled the Drew Clan's <br/>
"Mile of Ledges," which is every bit as spectacular (and difficult, at <br/>
times!) as they claim it to be.  All three boxes accounted for.  We also <br/>
met a nice family on the trail who didn't have a stamp yet, as this was <br/>
their first time out.  There was another mysterious pair who were pretty <br/>
far ahead of us the whole time, so we kept catching glimpses of them, but <br/>
didn't get to say hello.  After a quick break for lunch, we headed over to <br/>
ESAK's boxes behind lake Compounce.  Drove past the parking area a few <br/>
times before we spotted it!  This was also a fabulous hike, and we found <br/>
all three boxes.  However, they could use some new tupperware..."fish head" <br/>
had lots of water in it (we had some paper towels with us so we did our <br/>
best to dry it out...the logbook and stamp were safe since the plastic bag <br/>
had no holes) and "jullian's rock" was cracked in several places, though <br/>
some nice person had wrapped it in a large ziploc bag to keep the water out.<br/>
A truly fantastic day!<br/>
