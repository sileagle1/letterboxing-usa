<br/>
Each January at the height of snow season, The Girl Scouts of Dutchess County, NY begin to take orders.  This year, our order taking will begin at today January 7th at exactly 4:00 PM and end at 11:59 PM on the 23rd of January.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, begins The Great Cookie Caper!.  Spread out across Dutchess County, NY are 8 letterboxes, each representing a girl scout cookie.  These boxes will be pulled at the end of our sale.<br/>
<br/>
Since Cookies are fun, this series will be also:<br/>
<br/>
Box #1 is a mystery box, and the subsequent 7 are piggyback boxes.  <br/>
There is a treat in every letterbox for those who visit. (sorry no cookies)<br/>
The first 10 teams to provide proof of their visit to ALL 8 boxes gets a free box of Girl Scout Cookies of their choice.<br/>
Anyone who visits all 8 boxes gets directions to a bonus event box.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and support your local Girl Scouts!  The clues can be found at The Great Cookie Caper.<br/>
