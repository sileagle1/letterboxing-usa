I participated in the article with others who do post some or all of <br/>
their clues to the LbNA site. Some of my letterboxes are parts of <br/>
series, clues written by others, that are posted there. As I <br/>
mentioned in my post, the game "...runs along a continuum from <br/>
complete stealth and anonymity to others who are much more open." I <br/>
choose to be closer to end of the continuum where folks play with <br/>
more stealth. <br/>
<br/>
I also stated in my previous post that the "Time" article "was truly <br/>
a double edged sword" for me in terms of publicity for letterboxing, <br/>
unwanted or otherwise. Incidentally, I have been approached in the <br/>
past by various media representatives and I have always turned down <br/>
this type of exposure for letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
My decision to pass certain of my letterbox clues via Word of Mouth <br/>
(WOM)was made long before the "Time" article. Some of my personal <br/>
reasons for doing this are:<br/>
 (1)To avoid the creation of social trails in areas where I have <br/>
boxes to avoid what I have seen at many boxes in other places. These <br/>
become,in a micro sense, a form of unwanted publicity and may invite <br/>
unwanted visitors where I would prefer limited access only for those <br/>
who are searching for the box.<br/>
 (2)To provide a more artistic and creative approach that internet <br/>
posting does not allow. <br/>
<br/>
For those who don't know what Word of Mouth (WOM) means, in general <br/>
terms, these are clues that are not posted to the LbNA site. Rather, <br/>
they are made available by a variety of other means. They may be on a <br/>
private website, require some internet research and are found <br/>
elsewhere on the internet, passed between letterboxers, sent via <br/>
snail mail or email only. In particular, this latter means of getting <br/>
clues might be available for the asking or they may find their way to <br/>
your mailbox or even found in another letterbox. WOM has been a <br/>
Dartmoor tradition for years and, even in the early days of <br/>
letterboxing here in the US, many clues were passed along this way. <br/>
<br/>
I hope I've cleared this up for you.<br/>

&gt; Alafair,<br/>

&gt; Perhaps I am misunderstanding this. You participated in the article <br/>
and directed people to the website but then don't post your own clues <br/>
on the website for fear of repercussions from publicity? It doesn't <br/>
seem to make sense to me....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Alafair.  You've done a good job of explaining WOM, both the definition and the reasons behind it.  Like someone else who just posted, I'll be planting some in south Florida, but want to do a little Finding first to be comfortable with the process.  I find it always pays to be respectful.<br/>
