I have not placed many boxes, but have an active one in Marietta, <br/>
OH. (There are not many boxes in that part of Ohio.) With the recent <br/>
flooding of the Ohio River, I'm afraid my Half Marathon Box may be <br/>
gone! I saw a photo of the park where the box was placed - it was <br/>
TOTALLY under water. Because there was nothing heavy on the box, I'm <br/>
assuming it has floated to Cincinnati or even New Orleans by now!<br/>
Someone will be checking on it for me in the next few weeks. I'll <br/>
post again with results of the search.<br/>
