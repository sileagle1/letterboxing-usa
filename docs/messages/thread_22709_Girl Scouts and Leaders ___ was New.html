&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am from Overland Park, KS (the kansas city area).  I am so very <br/>
&gt; new <br/>
&gt; &gt; to this idea, but I am very interested in more info to carry on to <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; Girl Scouts and Leaders.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have some basics, but I need clues and details.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>

&gt; Hi Dana<br/>
&gt; You will find links to some helpful sites. Many of these and other <br/>
&gt; links can be found on the left hand side of the chatlist home page <br/>
&gt; as well.<br/>
&gt; Here is a major tip for you to pass along-STEALTH!<br/>
&gt; We have had letterboxes go missing due to a troupe of girl scouts <br/>
&gt; finding some of our urban letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; I even received a note from one troupe advising"after the last girl <br/>
&gt; stamped in(#12), we couldn't find the stamp so we put the box back <br/>
&gt; without it". (The stamp was found 12 feet away the next morning).<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing can be a fun thing for a small group, but letterboxing <br/>
&gt; in a urban setting is difficult for just two people. If you are <br/>
&gt; planning a troupe outing then maybe you should consider limiting the <br/>
&gt; size of the group and make sure the setting is somewhere that will <br/>
&gt; be fairly remote. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While I do Cub Scouts, not Girl Scouts, I can tell you<br/>
that what Rick has suggested below is exactly what we<br/>
have done.  We introduced our boys two years ago to<br/>
the hobby with some temporary boxes which we picked<br/>
back up.  On a later excursion, I let them help me<br/>
plant a box (and we do that now on every outing we go<br/>
on together).  I let them look at my logbook regularly<br/>
so they can see my new stamps, and while they are<br/>
whittling, I'm carving, so they see the work that goes<br/>
into making a box.  <br/>
<br/>
We've been introducing them to it for two years now,<br/>
and this year as Webelos, they will be helping me<br/>
plant a "training series" in a state park geared<br/>
toward scout groups, but available to any boxer.  This<br/>
is in response to curiosity among local scout groups<br/>
in letterboxing AND in the interest of protecting<br/>
local boxes from inexperienced scout groups herding<br/>
their way through box areas and causing problems for<br/>
either boxers or parks.  I decided to do the series<br/>
because I didn't want to discourage scouts from<br/>
letterboxing, but to train them to be good<br/>
letterboxers before exposing the boxes of non-scout<br/>
letterboxers to the risk of loss or damage caused by<br/>
overenthusiastic groups.  We went to the park<br/>
yesterday and scouted locations and started working on<br/>
Leave No Trace, which I see as the final step to<br/>
making them responsible boxers.  They will actively<br/>
participate in creating the boxes and in selecting<br/>
hiding places and writing the clues.  <br/>
<br/>
I also plan to take them to find some real boxes for<br/>
the first time this year.  BUT - there are four in the<br/>
den now, so it is a nice small group and they<br/>
understand that the hobby is based on work and<br/>
creativity of others and those efforts should be<br/>
respected.  They'll have LNT under their belts, so<br/>
they'll understand that they are to have minimum<br/>
impact, and we'll not leave a box behind until it is<br/>
buttoned up properly and rehidden well.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to Don's caveat to exercise STEALTH, I<br/>
would also add the note to REHIDE WELL.  That seems to<br/>
be another big complaint of boxers about scout groups.<br/>
