                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you for the compliment. I get out a lot to look at birds butterflies and dragonflies and mushrooms and what ever else is out there and I hide a box along the way. None of the walks are hard but I try to hide the boxes in interesting places. We are basically talking city parks here. I hid one last night while I was looking at Dragonflies. I'll write it up later.<br/>
<br/>
Did I mention we found the Roosevelt Island letterbox. Thank you Jay Drew. I can't wait till you get back down here to hide some more. It would be such a treat if you all came down and hid at least one box each.I would be busy for a long time looking for them. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your support and encouragement.<br/>
