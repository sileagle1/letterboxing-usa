I was out and about the Columbia River Gorge just yesterday and was <br/>
able to pick up Ponytail Falls and Wahkeena Falls.  It was great to <br/>
be able to get these stamps.  These copies by Ryan look just like the <br/>
originals!!  Although Ryan's clues for Ponytail were a little off.  <br/>
It is at the same tree as in the Original Clues, but not at the base <br/>
of the tree--rather the letterbox is about 4 or 5 steps away to the <br/>
SE underneath a few large stones.  <br/>
<br/>
The Wahkeena box was exactly where he said it would be--no problem.<br/>
<br/>
I also went on out to Triple Falls and snagged that box, since I had <br/>
not gotten it before.  It is amazing that so many Non-letterboxers <br/>
have logged into that notebook.  It is almost full.  I think there <br/>
were only about 6 or 7 pages left at the end there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I dropped off a couple of hitchhikers during my time in the Gorge as <br/>
well!!<br/>
