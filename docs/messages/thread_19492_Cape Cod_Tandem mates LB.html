                    <div class="plaintext-content">     A headsup for Cape Cod letterboxers. We visited our Tandemmates <br/>
LB yesterday and found it in precarious position due to vegetative <br/>
damage. We moved it a little ways and the new directions are posted. <br/>
Also, our Bourne Bridge LB is indeed missing as recently suggested on <br/>
the talk list. Also missing are the Bike buddies LB on the CCRT and <br/>
the Yurt LB at Nckerson State Park (all the other ones planted there <br/>
last October are fine as of the last two weeks ). The nearby Window <br/>
on the Bay is also gone some time ago. <br/>
     We recently re-planted the Sagamore Hill LB with new directions <br/>
and Eagle Point. <br/>
     We hope to replant some of these other missing ones later, but <br/>
for now they are off the list. <br/>
     Happy trails.   Dan and Donna<br/>
