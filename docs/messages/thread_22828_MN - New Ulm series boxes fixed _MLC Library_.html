library, I had one of my students check on the boxes during a trip up <br/>
there last weekend.  They reported back to me that he discovered that <br/>
the librarian had not processed the letterbooks as of yet.  With his <br/>
encouragement, she promised to have them on the shelves by yesterday <br/>
(Monday).  The same student is actually traveling back there this <br/>
coming weekend, and will verify whether they are in place as <br/>
promised.  I should have verification by next Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for any inconvenience.<br/>
