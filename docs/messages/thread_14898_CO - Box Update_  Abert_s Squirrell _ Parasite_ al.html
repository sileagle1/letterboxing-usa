                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello to the interested!!  Yesterday, Aug. 6, Autumn, Fiona, Ariana, <br/>
Trinity Jah and I met up in Bailey to hunt the above mentioned box.  <br/>
The spot was beautiful!!  And, to our surprise a HH!!!  The HH is <br/>
Pandy's Bear's Angel.  We all stamped it and let Fiona take it to be <br/>
placed on one of her next adventures!!  I never in a million years <br/>
thought that I would see the stamps of the like of Pandy, JuggleMouse <br/>
and some of the other "infamous" LBers.  The Abert's Squirrel &amp; <br/>
Parasite boxes were in great locations with really good clues.  I <br/>
will update the placers.  Should I post the HH info on that talk list <br/>
or is that someone elses job?  I am sorry if this question is one of <br/>
those "newbie" questions that gets asked all of the time.  This was a <br/>
first HH for all of us and I was delegated to do the updates.  Thank <br/>
you to the placers and thank you in advance for answering my <br/>
question!!<br/>

parasite box, and 'lo and behold a hitchhiker to boot (a rarity in <br/>
Colorado, mind you).<br/>
<br/>
So... here are all of us doing the *happy dance* and little Trinity <br/>
Jah (who is like four years old) is coming down the hill wiggling her <br/>
butt with her index fingers in the air imitating the "grown-ups" <br/>
doing a happy dance.  I nearly peed myself.<br/>
<br/>
Great boxes, great exchanges, lovely day!<br/>
