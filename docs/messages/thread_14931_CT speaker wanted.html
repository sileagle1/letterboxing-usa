<br/>
Is there anyone who has a 60 to 90 minute talk that they have given <br/>
to groups?  Would someone like to develop a talk, with slides or <br/>
overheads, that they could give?  Topics could include basic <br/>
letterboxing, the web site, following the clues, planting boxes, <br/>
entering clues onto the web site, etc.  Things like stamp carving <br/>
could be left to another class.<br/>
<br/>
I am new to letterboxing and don't feel qualified to speak on all <br/>
aspects of the hobby.<br/>
