Box (mineral bath box) was missing.  The box itself is still there, <br/>
but the book and stamp are gone.  I went on  to the second box and <br/>
found it with no problem.  It is a gorgeous, gorgeous stamp and I can <br/>
see why someone might have taken the 1st stamp if the artwork is <br/>
anything like the second box. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I hope that Caroline can replace this one soon.  It is really a great <br/>
park and I really enjoyed the hike. <br/>

also.  They have closed the entrance on Alum Rock Avenue and you have <br/>
to access the park on Penitencia Road.  <br/>
