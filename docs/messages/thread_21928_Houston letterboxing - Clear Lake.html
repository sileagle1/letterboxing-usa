Neptune, STS 51-L, and Aduceus-Cay.  Neptune has one of my favorite <br/>
stamps in this area.  That is a nice outing (sweaty and mosquito-y in <br/>
June, I'm sure).  <br/>
<br/>
We haven't gotten to as many in that area as we would like, but one on <br/>
our to-do list is Haak Wine (in Santa Fe), because it seems like a fun <br/>
outing.  Lots of drive-bys in that general vicinity.  If you need help <br/>
figuring where things are, feel free to email me off-list.<br/>

&gt; I'll be returning to an old Stompin' Ground (Pasadena/Clear Lake <br/>
&gt; Area) for 1 week in mid-June.  Do you have any recommendations for <br/>
&gt; sweaty (no-doubt) box hunting in that area?<br/>
