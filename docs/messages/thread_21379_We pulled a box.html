Hey, everyone,<br/>
Wow! It's been awhile since we've posted!  We pulled our box <br/>
called "Are You Awake?  Me, Too!" because of the ever destructive <br/>
thing called CONSTRUCTION.  The city or county is laying sewage pipe <br/>
and almost cleaned out the whole location.  It's a good thing we <br/>
pulled it!  I'd also like to say that the logbook is FULL.  That's <br/>
awesome.  We'd like to get out soon to check the other boxes and <br/>
maybe hunt for some too.  Maybe we'll see ya! <br/>
