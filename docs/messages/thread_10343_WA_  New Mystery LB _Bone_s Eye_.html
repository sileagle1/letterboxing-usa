<br/>

Bone's Eye Mystery Letterbox<br/>
Placed:  18 January 2003 <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:   Take the gravel trail to the South of the crosswalk.  Veer <br/>
Left at the `Y'.  Take the next Left.  Veer around the bend.  Seek <br/>
out a 3-trunked tree (maple?) on your left with a 4th smaller bent-<br/>
necked conjoined friend (or relative?) reaching to the North.  <br/>
Bone's Eye is tucked within a cubby hole beneath &amp; behind the 4th <br/>
sibling.  <br/>
<br/>
Note:  When you're finished with your trek, there exists one of the <br/>
world's most renowned collections of Bone's Eyes not very far from <br/>
this spot  ;)<br/>
