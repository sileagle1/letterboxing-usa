<br/>
This letterbox is found in Byles Sanctuary on Route 44 in Ashford.  You will <br/>
need the directions for the Special Snowflake Letterbox from <br/>
letterboxing.org.  We planted this letterbox in honor of the loud and joyous <br/>
greeting we received from one of the animals when we went to find the <br/>
Special Snowflake Letterbox!  We havent heard him do it again but the words <br/>
hee-haw dont do this donkey justice.  Placed on September 30, 2001 by Larry <br/>
Boy, Dino Boy, Baby Brother Bear, Mama Duck and Gramma Gramma.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the directions to the Special Snowflake Letterbox.  After stamping in <br/>
at the Snowflake continue on the yellow trail.  Shortly you will see the <br/>
trail go down into a stony wet flat area.  On the right on the way down is a <br/>
tree leaning above a small grassy mound.  A dead branch of the tree hangs <br/>
over the mound.  You will reach your goal at the rock next to the mound.  <br/>
Stamp in and replace as you found it.  You can return the way you came or <br/>
continue on the yellow trail until you reach the dirt road.  Take a right on <br/>
the dirt road for a short walk to your car.<br/>
