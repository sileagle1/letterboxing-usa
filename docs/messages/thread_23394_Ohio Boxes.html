The following article appeared in this month's issue of Echoes, the<br/>
newsletter of Ohio Historical Society.  After reading this article I<br/>
emailed them to inquire about Letterboxing and the reply was that "We<br/>
are currently finalizing our geocaching program. We are aware of<br/>
letterboxing and feel that this could fall under the same parameters.<br/>
 Please revisit our website after May 15 for information and to<br/>
download an application."<br/>
<br/>
Their web site is at <http: geocache="" www.ohiohistory.org=""></http:>.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware, though, that this week OHS's web site has been down while<br/>
they install some new systems.  <br/>

OHS Sites Seek Geocachers<br/>
<br/>
Starting in May, 12 Ohio Historical Society sites will become more<br/>
than just destinations for history lovers - they will be targets for<br/>
geocachers as well.<br/>
<br/>
Geocaching is a combination of a treasure hunt and a hike that<br/>
requires the use of a global positioning system (GPS) receiver. While<br/>
some people define it as a sport and others as a hobby, it is an<br/>
activity that can be enjoyed individually or with groups of family and<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
Todd Tucky, the Society's information systems manager, has been<br/>
involved in geocaching for two years. Last year, he introduced<br/>
geocaching to his wife Mimi and children, Hannah, 10, Ethan 8, and<br/>
Emma, S, and it quickly evolved into a regular family activity.<br/>
<br/>
"For me, it's the thrill of the hunt and the beauty of the outdoors,"<br/>
Tucky said. "For the kids, they love the technology and take turns<br/>
holding the GPS receiver. They also enjoy looking when I we get close<br/>
to the cache." <br/>
<br/>
The objective of geocaching is to locate hidden "caches" using GPS<br/>
technology and a little sleuthing. A cache is a waterproof box that<br/>
contains a log book for all successful searchers to sign and a few<br/>
small trinkets like foreign currency, small rubber animals and toy<br/>
action figures that geocachers can exchange with each other. <br/>
<br/>
The geocaching craze has been gaining in popularity in the United<br/>
States and around the world since 2000 when the U.S. Government opened<br/>
up GPS satellite technology to civilians. The GPS uses longitude and<br/>
latitude coordinates to pinpoint the exact position of hand-held GPS<br/>
receivers. Geocachers begin their search for caches at the<br/>
<www.geocaching.com> Web site where they can find the coordinates of<br/>
caches in specific areas defined by ZIP : codes or large cities. <br/>
<br/>
Society staff became aware ~ of the popularity of geo- caching about<br/>
three years ago. <br/>
<br/>
"We had a lot of people e-mail us and ask about putting caches on our<br/>
sites," said Erin Bartlett, community and support services<br/>
coordinator. "As we received more and more inquiries, we decided to<br/>
get more proactive and investigate the possibility of placing some<br/>
caches of our own." <br/>
<br/>
In late 2005, OHS formed a geocaching committee to develop a policy<br/>
and plan for the activity at OHS sites. Geocaching will be allowed a<br/>
only in nonsensitive areas of OHS sites where archaeological,<br/>
historical or ecological areas will not be disturbed. It also details<br/>
rules for the placement of outside caches on Society property. Caches<br/>
will be placed at Adena Mansion &amp; Gardens, Armstrong Air &amp; Space<br/>
Museum, Cedar Bog, Flint Ridge, Fort Ancient, Fort Meigs, National<br/>
Road/Zane Grey Museum, Ohio Historical Center, Piqua Historical Area,<br/>
Serpent Mound, Wahkeena Preserve and Youngstown Historical Center. <br/>
<br/>
Another way to combine interest in geocaching and history is through<br/>
waymarking. Waymarkers find Ohio Historical Markers by using latitude<br/>
and longitude instead of street addresses, and then collect and store<br/>
the coordinates in handheld GPS units to prove they have visited the<br/>
locations. Longitude and latitude coordinates for many Ohio Historical<br/>
Markers are available on the Remarkable Ohio Web site at<br/>
www.remarkableohio.org. Geocachers interested in leaving caches at<br/>
Ohio Historical Markers must contact each marker's local sponsors for<br/>
permission. A list of sponsors for each marker is found on Remarkable<br/>
Ohio. <br/>
<br/>
For OHS, getting into the geocaching craze presents an opportunity to<br/>
get more people interested in history. <br/>
<br/>
"I think it's going to bring in a whole new dynamic of visitors,"<br/>
Bartlett said. "We're going to attract people who have never visited<br/>
our sites before and hopefully they'll gain a deeper appreciation of<br/>
Ohio history after their visit." <br/>
