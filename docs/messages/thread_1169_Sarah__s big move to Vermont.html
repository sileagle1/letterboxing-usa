&gt;    Hey....just wanted to let you know I have infact left EMS and Rhode Island / Connecticut.  In my first week as a Vermont resident, I took the liberty to kayak around on Lake Champlain and have hidden two new boxes...my first in Vermont.  So, please watch for the clues...one is on Knight Island, and the other on Woods.  I'll need a bit of time to settle in before getting back in the swing of Letterboxing and contributing more to the sport.<br/>
&gt;    As for the discussion of what to name the "parasite", "hitchhiking" boxes...it doesn't matter to me as long as The Y2K box and the Fuzzy Caterpillar boxes are included.  I'll send in the other clues soon.<br/>

&gt;Happy Letterboxing<br/>
