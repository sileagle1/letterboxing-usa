Clues: Easy<br/>
Hike: Easy<br/>
Closest Town:  Fort Pierce, St. Lucie County, Fl<br/>
<br/>
Knot Just Another Shamrock<br/>
<br/>
Fort Pierce Inlet State Park<br/>
Coastal Hammock Trail<br/>
Fort Pierce, St. Lucie County, Florida<br/>
<br/>
To the park:  Fort Pierce Inlet State Park is located four miles east<br/>
of Fort Pierce, via North Causeway.  Hours of operation are 8 am to<br/>
sundown, 365 days of the year.  After paying your fee and asking for a<br/>
trail map at the guard shack, continue on to the left at the fork and<br/>
park at the very left end of the lot at the Hammock Trailhead.  Here<br/>
you can pick up an informative brochure for a self guided interpretive<br/>
walk.<br/>
<br/>
The legends of the shamrock are many.  It was a sacred plant to the<br/>
Druids of Ireland due to its leaves forming a triad.  St. Patrick used<br/>
the plant as a symbol of the miracle of the Blessed Trinity while<br/>
preaching to the Irish.  The shamrock was also sacred in Iran as an<br/>
emblem of the Persian Triads.  In the 19th century, the shamrock was a<br/>
symbol of rebellion against the British crown and anyone caught<br/>
wearing it was hanged.  This is when the phrase "the wearin' o' the<br/>
green" was coined.  Today, the shamrock is the most recognized symbol<br/>
of Ireland and her people.<br/>
<br/>
To the box:  Enter the trail and at the "T", take a 170 degree reading<br/>
and follow that path.  As you meander down the path, you'll come upon<br/>
a "quadrapus", a distant relative of the octopus, on the right.  You<br/>
will then pass under crossed trunks and the trail will soon zag.  You<br/>
will then soon approach a smooth barked tri-trunked tree with it's own<br/>
vines enveloping it.  Stand on the western side of the tree and take a<br/>
171 degree compass reading.  Now just swing from the vines in front of<br/>
you and find Knot Just Another Shamrock in the biceps of the tree<br/>
ahead of you.<br/>
<br/>

Hold Fast<br/>
<br/>
Pepper Park, Riverside<br/>
Fort Pierce, St. Lucie County, Florida<br/>
<br/>
To the park:  Take highway A1A north from the Fort Pierce Inlet State<br/>
Park 1.5 miles to Pepper Park.  Riverside will be on the left side of<br/>
the road.  Park at Dock B.<br/>
<br/>
The Celtic High Cross is a standing cross with a circle at it's middle<br/>
and represents any one of many ideas.  Most contemporary crosses<br/>
indicate burial sites, although there are many that were erected as<br/>
meeting places, or are just wonderful pieces of art.  The cross itself<br/>
has been said to symbolize the male and female aspects of life, the<br/>
cross being the male aspect and the circle being female.  Another<br/>
representation is the horizontal arms signify the physical world while<br/>
the vertical arms are the spiritual.  Where they meet in the center<br/>
symbolizes balance and wholeness.  The circle was added as a symbol of<br/>
being complete.  The runic letters on this stamp represent "Hold Fast".<br/>
<br/>
To the box:  Walk towards dock B and read about Manatee Basics for<br/>
Boaters.  Take the path that leads to the dock.  At the "Dock B" sign,<br/>
take a 148 degree reading to a multi-trunked stump.  From that stump<br/>
look ESE at 118 degrees.  The box is just beyond the live 15 foot palm<br/>
tree in the top of a dead palm tree stump.<br/>
<br/>

Love, Loyalty, and Friendship<br/>

Savannas Preserve State Park<br/>
2541 Walton Road, Port St. Lucie, St. Lucie County, FL<br/>
<br/>
To the park:  From Route 1, go east on Walton Rd.  Take a left into<br/>
the State Park at the Educational Center entrance.  Park close to the<br/>
Educational Center and take the White Trail.<br/>
<br/>
Claddagh is a small fishing village in County Galway.  A legend states<br/>
that one of the fishermen, Richard Joyce, was captured, and while in<br/>
captivity learned the art of goldsmithing.  His betrothed back in the<br/>
village was inconsolable, but never gave up hope that he would return.<br/>
 While he was away, he created the Claddagh Ring for the woman that he<br/>
loved.  The heart symbolized their love, hands holding the heart to<br/>
symbolize the friendship they shared, and the crown symbolizing the<br/>
loyalty they had for each other.  After years of captivity, he escaped<br/>
and returned to his village.  His betrothed had never married.  He<br/>
gave her the ring and they married soon afterwards.  Today the<br/>
Claddagh ring is used throughout Ireland as a traditional wedding<br/>
band.  The heart is worn outwards if one is single, inwards if one is<br/>
"taken".  "Let love and friendship reign."<br/>
<br/>
To the box:  As you walk along the trail, read about Pygmy<br/>
Rattlesnakes, Gopher Tortoises, and Bobcats.  At the bobcat info sign,<br/>
continue to follow the trail.  Up ahead, read about the invasive<br/>
species of plants, including the Australian Pine and Brazilian Pepper.<br/>
 After this sign, take the first unmarked trail  50 degrees NE.  Walk<br/>
10 steps and look in the stump closest to the trail on your left.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:  1)  All compass bearings magnetic.<br/>
	2)  One step = one footfall.<br/>
	3)  Please be careful when poking into dark places.  Wear<br/>
gloves or prod with a stick.<br/>
