<br/>
I'm a newbie (P0 F3 now) that was turned on to<br/>
letterboxing as a result of the Time article. The only<br/>
salient part of article for me was the url of the<br/>
website. From there I learned all about the virtues of<br/>
respecting the letterboxes and how to conduct myself. <br/>
<br/>
I believe the discussion of WOM is moot. As soon as<br/>
you put it on the internet, it's wide open and the<br/>
genie is out of the bottle. <br/>
<br/>
Look at the geocaching website<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/ ... their search engine is<br/>
much better than letterbox.org, their community is<br/>
much much larger than letterboxing and the shear<br/>
number of geocaches appearing is absolutely explosive.<br/>
Part of this, I feel, is due to a geocache being a<br/>
little more kid-friendly with the toy-exchange aspect<br/>
of it, but that's a separate thread. <br/>
<br/>
Has publicity hurt their community? Perhaps. But<br/>
overall, it seems that more people is actually helping<br/>
the activity, not hurting it. <br/>
<br/>
I live in Nova Scotia, and have four letterboxes to<br/>
choose from (until I start planting ;-) but over 250<br/>
geocaches. While it's tempting to buy a GPS for that<br/>
reason alone, I don't feel GeoCaching has the fun<br/>
challenge of the puzzles behind a good letterbox<br/>
(there are exceptions of course).<br/>
<br/>
My vote: Grow the community and accept some letterbox<br/>
casualities along the way.<br/>

Seriously, I felt differently after I put my little buddy in the box and out<br/>
