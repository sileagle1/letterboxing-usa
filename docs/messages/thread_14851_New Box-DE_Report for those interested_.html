I finally have the clues to my first box up on the site. I was <br/>
thinking of making it a mystery, but it was too easy to find out <br/>
about this place online. LOL<br/>
<br/>
We spent the last 2 days doing some hunting. Sunday we went to PA and <br/>
got Spirit and Honor. Both are in great shape and active. :)  Then we <br/>
headed back to DE for Serendipity's Sister and Along the Way. <br/>
Serendipity's Sister is in a beautiful location. I can't say where. <br/>
It's a mystery. SpringChick, be prepared for an email from me. I want <br/>
to know more about that place! <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we went to PA again for the Wissahickon boxes. Boy were <br/>
those ever a hike! And with a 3 yr. old to boot! Body Parts was the <br/>
hardest to find. I wouldn't want to do that one again. LOL<br/>
We looked for the Eastern State Penitentary box, but we believe it's <br/>
MIA. We KNOW we were in the right place, but no box. :( <br/>
So we only went 3 for 4 yesterday but that's cool. We had fun, even <br/>
though we got stuck in the woods during a major thunderstorm. We were <br/>
muddy and drenched! LOL  We were hoping to get to The Portia boxes in <br/>
Fairmount Park, but were too beat after the Wissahickon. We're off <br/>
again tomorrow, so hopefully we find them then. :)<br/>
