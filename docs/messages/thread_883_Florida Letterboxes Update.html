<br/>
I tried to post to group using the webpage form last week but it doesn't <br/>
appear to have made it to the list. I haven't been around for a  while, <br/>
but I see that it appears I still have the only letterboxes hidden in <br/>
Florida. I went out this past weekend to verify they still exist. Two out <br/>
of three survived hurricanes, fires, and vandalism this past year. The <br/>
only one that didn't was vandalized, the squirrelfish box.  Strangely, it <br/>
was opened and the log book stolen leaving the box and the stamp behind. <br/>
Fortunately, this makes it easy for me to relocate it. One surviving box <br/>
had been visited once, the other twice. I sure wish there were some other <br/>
boxes in Florida for me to find. I need to know how to modify my record <br/>
for the relocated box since I haven't been on the list for a while. I <br/>
have also been doing more off road bicycling lately and likely will hide <br/>
other boxes if someone is there to find them. I would appreciate anyone <br/>
on this list that lives in Florida, or is likely to visit in the near <br/>
future, contacting me directly. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

Have you ever wondered about heaven and what the "entrance requirements" are? <br/>
There are many theories but you can find out for yourself what the Bible <br/>
says.  These are just a few passages that explain God's plan:<br/>
     Acts 2:36-41        Romans 10:17     Matt 10:32-33<br/>
     Romans 10:9-10   Acts 8:34-38        Acts 2:38     Romans 10:14+<br/>
     Matt 28:19-20       Mark 16:16          <br/>
     1John 4:3             Matt 10:32           1 Peter 3:21<br/>
How do you do that? These passages are good examples of how:<br/>
      Acts 2:36-38;   Romans 6:1-5;  Ephesians 2:19;  Acts 16:29-33; Acts <br/>
22:16 !!!!!<br/>
Then: Eph 2:4-5;  2 Cor 5:14-17  &amp; Romans 8:12-14; Eph 4:16<br/>
On that last day you can claim your reward: Romans 8:18; Rev 2:10<br/>

Currently the clues are available at the Letterboxing NA site. However, <br/>
as I mentioned previously the squirrelfish one was vandalized and so that <br/>
clue will have to be redone after I relocate it. If I get the <br/>
International Letterboxing Club site up again (letterboxing.com) (as I <br/>
hope to do in a month or so) they will be available there as well. It has <br/>
been down because I took down the server where it lived and haven't done <br/>
much letterboxing the last year due to lack of boxes (other than my own) <br/>
to find in Florida. The current boxes are located near the coast about 35 <br/>
miles from Orlando, an easy day trip if anyone is down visiting the house <br/>
of the mouse (Disney). I plan to plant some others a little closer if <br/>
there is interest. I also have considered another idea that I might try <br/>
if there is interest. I have season passes to all the Disney parks and <br/>
Seaworld. I don't think it would be realistic to plant actual boxes in <br/>
the parks, however I could easily plant "sticky" notes that have been <br/>
stamped with park related images and publish clues to these. I don't <br/>
expect they would last long because of weather and the mouse police (they <br/>
clean up anything that isn't breathing), but if I knew someone was coming <br/>
I could try to plant them around that time. Let me know if there is <br/>
interest. Thanks.<br/>

As I said they are about 35 miles from Orlando, probably about 50 miles <br/>
from the mouse. However, by laborday weekend I may have planted quite a <br/>
few more- if I get inspired despite the lack of boxes for me to find. <br/>
Hopefully I will, it has been too long since I planted some and as long <br/>
as I know people will be looking for them I am not as concerned about the <br/>
lack of boxes for me find down here.  As I mentioned, I may also be able <br/>
to plant some images in the parks for you to find if it works out well. <br/>
Make sure you contact me in the weeks preceeding your visit. <br/>
