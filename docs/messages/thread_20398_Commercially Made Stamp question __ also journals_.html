I've used nwstamps.com -- Northwestern Stamps -- a couple of times and the <br/>
stamps have turned out quite nice, and they made and delivered them promptly.  I <br/>
had them make a couple of signature stamps for me.  I'm great at drawing, but <br/>
I just can't do sculpting -- I have like a learning disability when it comes <br/>
to thinking three-dimensionally -- so my carving is just awful, even with good <br/>
carving tools I just can't do it.  There might be stamp stores around me that <br/>
do it, I've never called around to find out.  Online is much easier for me -- <br/>
I hate to get out and shop.  But if you don't mind going out to shop, call <br/>
around to some of the rubber stamp stores in your area, or the scrapbooking <br/>
stores, and see if they offer custom stamp services.  <br/>
<br/>
Before you give up on carving tho, make sure you've got a good medium that <br/>
you're using -- I absolutely love Mastercarve by Staedtler -- I buy the thicker <br/>
size, the 3/4 inch.  It advertises that it cuts like butter and it does.  Plus <br/>
you'd really have to work at it to get it to crumble.  And make sure you've <br/>
got a Speedball with a wide variety of their blades (and make sure that they're <br/>
extremely sharp -- new doesn't always mean extremely sharp -- sometimes they <br/>
sit unsold on the shelf and can go a little dull just sitting there -- and a <br/>
little dull can make a big difference), and a variety of exacto knife sizes, <br/>
and also for sure a #4 exacto knife blade, which is a much smaller, finer, <br/>
stencil cutting type blade.    <br/>
<br/>
I still go ahead and carve the stamps for the boxes I place -- but if I'm <br/>
putting the clues out there on the internet, like at LB.org, for folks who might <br/>
not know my lack of carving skill, I just always put it in my clues that folks <br/>
shouldn't expect much.  :-)  a "Finder Beware" kind of thing.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
But my two signature stamps were commercially made by Northwestern Stamps <br/>
from my own designs.  They can also do "sheets" of stamps if you want to do your <br/>
own mounting.  I thought they were fairly decent price-wise, but I didn't do <br/>
much of any comparative-price shopping at all.  I went with them on a <br/>
recommendation I got from someone else that they liked the job they did.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the journals go, I use whatever hits my fancy.  I was in a Barnes &amp; <br/>
Noble Bookstore near my home a few months back and found an interesting <br/>
unlined writing journal totally handmade and handbound and decorated by the <br/>
Nepalese, and that's what I'm currently using.  <br/>
<br/>
When I letterbox, I like to take photographs of the place also, and put the <br/>
stamp, the photos, and then write some about the adventure too, in the journal. <br/>
 I generally don't carry the journal out with me when I go to find the box.  <br/>
I buy different colours of card stock from a scrapbooking store, stamp on the <br/>
card stock, then bring it back home, trim it how I want it with a paper <br/>
trimmer, and glue it into the journal or use those glue dots, etc.  My cameras, my <br/>
binoculars, my chocolate, water, my dogs, and oftentimes my horse, plus a <br/>
variety of supplies in case the box needs any sort of first aid, my stamp and <br/>
inkpads -- heck, those are enough already to take with me.  :-)  The poor book <br/>
would probably get ruined if I tossed it in with the rest of the mess.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the boxes I find are out in forest preserves type places, and I <br/>
recently found a really nice scrapbook with various rough leaves on a rough cream <br/>
coloured cover at Archiver's, a chain scrapbooking store.  That's what I'll use <br/>
next.  Scrapbooking has gotten so popular that there are a lot of great <br/>
scrapbooks and designs for sale in the scrapbooking stores. <br/>
<br/>
And then I often use some of the little scrapbooking "embellishments" that <br/>
they sell to decorate my pages with too.   <br/>
<br/>
I think scrapbooking and letterboxing go well together.  Creativity-wise, you <br/>
can do as much or as little as you want nowadays with the letterboxing -- <br/>
there's so much choice out there.  Unfortunately, I never used to think much of <br/>
scrapbooking until I realized that it would be great to combine with the <br/>
letterboxing.  I still haven't let anyone drag me to any "crops" yet :-) tho that <br/>
day may come.<br/>

I have tried and am just not a carver. I have a great design, but am <br/>
not sure where to take it to have it made into a stamp. Is it an on-<br/>
line business, a local thing? Where to go?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
