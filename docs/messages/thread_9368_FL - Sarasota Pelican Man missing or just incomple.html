Sarasota.<br/>
She placed it a while back.<br/>
She just returned to Florida the late part of November.<br/>
I will see if she will be so kind to place another stamp for me.<br/>
Sorry about your inconvenience<br/>

a kind thing to do if it's not too much trouble for you.<br/>
I think an animal got to it.<br/>
I told her to put a little rock on to of the box..... (she is not a<br/>
letterboxer )<br/>
The stamp I had carved took me a couple of hours and I thought it was<br/>
one of my more intricate stamps . Oh well ! That's the way it goes .<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
John<br/>
Let me know where it ends up so I can have the clues revised by the<br/>
appropriate webmaster !<br/>
