my children and I have to be the WORST letterboxers EVER! When our schedule<br/>
and the weather finally cooperated with us yesterday, and allowed us to go<br/>
letterboxing, we went in search of two boxes here locally in Virginia Beach.<br/>
We found NEITHER of them! LOL! We first tackled the Elusive Red Wolf, and<br/>
after deciphering the clues in as many ways as we possibly could, we ended<br/>
up searching the entire area, in an 50 foot circumference. We came up empty<br/>
handed, scratched and disheartened. So we set out to find John and Jackie's<br/>
Wacky Box. I really thought this would be an easy find, though hard to play<br/>
down what we were doing as we were at the main library. Alas! Nothing again,<br/>
though we were frustrated enough to get out the rake and shovel I had in the<br/>
car and scrape through every bush surrounding the library! I guess I REALLY<br/>
need some advice, how are you all finding boxes? What are we NOT doing? We<br/>
are currently toting our score of 1f 4 tried proudly as I doubt any one else<br/>
can make the same claim, lol! I fear we are not very adept at letterboxing,<br/>
but we are having fun! Kerri<br/>

second letterbox I have tried to place that has come up missing.<br/>
<br/>
The clues were rather simple and you couldn't have missed its hiding <br/>
spot.<br/>
<br/>
Ah well.  Maybe I need to hide him in the different section of the <br/>
area.<br/>
