<br/>
We planted a series of 5 boxes dedicated to all the chores we should be doing when we are out boxing. We've named it "I'd Rather be Letterboxing!" It is in Hebron, CT. Let us know if you visit the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Then we decided we had to find a few before we retired for the day.<br/>
We found Odetah. What a lovely campground!!! We tried to be as discrete as possible but some construction workers were watching from above.  <br/>
<br/>
Next was William Irving's Broken Heart. I think this is definitely one of the most memorable boxes I have ever found. It just tugs at my heart in so many different ways. Read the story and find the box and you'll see what I mean! <br/>
<br/>
Then we bounced over to Salem and found In Search of the Church of Grim. Love this stamp! Box was in good shape. <br/>
<br/>
This was the exact moment that Ladybug98 hit the wall. Her little eyes couldn't stay open one more minute and she fell asleep so we called it a day.<br/>
<br/>
THANKS EVERYONE FOR THE GREAT BOXES.<br/>
<br/>
