                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all, "The End Gang" enjoyed some wonderful warm weather in <br/>
Fredricksburg Va. and enjoyed finding 5 boxes plus a hitch hiker. It <br/>
was difficult to return to Connecticut to find snow on the ground and <br/>
more in the forcast.<br/>
   One of the boxes found was the "Confederate Cemetary". I very much <br/>
wanted this box as I am a Civil War nut and eager to see this site. <br/>
After the recent discussions, I was a little nervous about going <br/>
after this box. The box was easy and stamping took only about 15min. <br/>
in all (Box in Great shape). I visited this site,however,for another <br/>
45min. as it was so rich in history. The monument is beautiful and I <br/>
found myself humbled when walking among so many confedeate dead that <br/>
had sacrificed all for their convictions. It made stop to think about <br/>
our past from a different perspective. I also walked among other <br/>
family plots. Many families lay at rest together with many members <br/>
having fought together in the Confederate States Army. I thought this <br/>
unity was wonderful and I felt pride in my country's history even <br/>
beyond our civil war. My Great-Great Grandfather, a Union cavalryman, <br/>
has probably rolled in his grave that I got this feeling from a "Reb" <br/>
grave site.<br/>
   I have gained much more from this letterbox than simply an additon <br/>
to my stamp count, and is the reason I do leterboxing. I hope others <br/>
enjoy this letterbox for what it can teach us. My view comes down to <br/>
what others have stated... Be respectful of placement and use common <br/>
sense. I think a cemetary box is o.k. if placed to offer a teaching <br/>
of our past. <br/>
  Just wanted to add my thoughts to the mix. Sorry this is somewhat <br/>
after the main discussion. Safe trails to all.<br/>
