                    <div class="plaintext-content">Goodmorning!   Having discovered Letterboxing over the weekend courtsey of<br/>
the Washington Post, my friends and I, 'The Usual Suspects' have found<br/>
several of the Maryland boxes, and have planted 2 new boxes:<br/>
<br/>
'The Shire'<br/>
The Usual Suspects, 7.14.02<br/>
Montgomery County, Maryland<br/>
near Comus and Barnesville, MD<br/>
PARENTAL ADVISORY:  Poem on notebook cover is "PG-13"; implied adult themes.<br/>
Stamp is "G" rated.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  same as "Tuscarora" except I've lived in Barnesville my whole<br/>
life and never heard of a town called "Tuscarora".  <br/>
North on 270.  Get off at the exit for 'Comus, Sugarloaf Mountain'.  Follow<br/>
Old Hundred road into Comus; Right onto Comus, which leads to the Sugarloaf<br/>
parking lot.  Squirel's directions are better.  Drive up to the West View.<br/>
<br/>
Park your car at the West View, lower <br/>
Skirt the rock wall, it's not a trail, it's "other"<br/>
Now round the circle, widdershins<br/>
1969, turn off, tune in.<br/>
wind your way up, pass the stairs,<br/>
through the crack; there's blueberries there.<br/>
Along a ledge, and to the bend<br/>
you'll see a view and an eagle's head<br/>
and on your right there is a tree<br/>
Red Oak, I think, but don't ask me.<br/>
Behind the tree's a doggie's paw<br/>
now stick your hand into it's maw<br/>
Here is your prize, the one you seek<br/>
with poem written, not for the meek.<br/>
<br/>
'The Blair Letterboxing Project'<br/>
The Usual Suspects, 7.14.02<br/>
Black Hills Regional Park, Maryland<br/>
nearest... oh...  Clarksburg or Germantown, MD?  Montgomery County.<br/>
<br/>
Enter park, Pass visitors center, Right on Picnic Lane (1st entrance), Park<br/>
in lot on right.<br/>
<br/>
You take the highland, <br/>
someone else can take the low,<br/>
along the pav'ed path you'll go.<br/>
Past hollowed stump and "V" type tree<br/>
Then in a while, a "natural" path you'll see<br/>
On your left, by another "V" tree<br/>
careful on the slope - it's slippery.<br/>
Now down you follow a farmhouse wall<br/>
and 'Mind the Gap' - this game's British, afterall.<br/>
On a tree, the Blair Witch's mark<br/>
Feel lucky you're not here in the dark<br/>
Turn a quarter, like a sundial,<br/>
'sacred' to the egyptians, on the nile<br/>
What, can't find it? Well, ofcourse it's unseen:<br/>
it's buried under something green.<br/>
