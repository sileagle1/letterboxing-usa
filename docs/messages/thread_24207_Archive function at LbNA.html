                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wonder how many letterboxers use the archive function on their letterboxes which have <br/>
been retired, confirmed missing, or won't be replaced, letterboxes?<br/>
<br/>
Before this tool was available, we could mark MIA/Retired in the Title.  I used the archive <br/>
function on a couple of my boxes.  I doubt I will replace these, but if I choose to do so, it <br/>
is a simple click to "un-archive" them.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask this question comes from my experience of out-of-town/out-of-state <br/>
visitors who ask for local recommendations.  Sure, I can identify the active, "don't miss" <br/>
boxes from the page before I log-in, but as I find boxes, they fall off my log-in search <br/>
page.  If I do a search after I log-in, the drop-down status bar may give the actual status <br/>
of "missing" or "retired" but remains on the list for those who don't log in.  <br/>
<br/>
I also archived some boxes so that others might find the locations "available" to plant new <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>
If the clues say "will be replaced later" I might choose to "ignore" until a later date.  When it <br/>
becomes active, I may never know.  The onus is on me if I "ignore" boxes.  I would <br/>
probably create a "new letterbox" for replacements after I archived the former letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I find it difficult to recommend certain letterboxers' boxes after I have found them when <br/>
the status has not been updated in a long time and the last comments written in the clues <br/>
said "missing."  Some people move and we never hear from them again.  The boxes may <br/>
indeed be active, but when others are clearly not, it's a tough call to make.<br/>
<br/>
Do you use the Archive function on your LbNA letterboxes?  Why or why not?<br/>

Does it affect a finder's F-count when a box is deleted? <br/>
I've considered deleting some of mine from the LBNA site but people have<br/>
logged the box as finds. I'd hate to mess with their count. <br/>

<br/>
Using an on-line site to maintain your count doesn't seem practical, so <br/>
we really don't care about affecting someone's on-line "F count".  Not <br/>
all boxes are on all sites and you are dependent on that site being up <br/>
forever (or as long as you are an active boxer).  Much better to <br/>
maintain your own personal count.<br/>
