<br/>
    One of our founding tenets was to be inclusive and national,<br/>
international - one big club.  Sometimes gatherings are announced and<br/>
anybody in the region who wishes to attend is welcome.  There  have been<br/>
gatherings in Seattle (3 attending, 1998); Vermont (15?  attending, Nov<br/>
1999): CT, Rocky Point (May 2000, 10-15 attending) and some thoughts of<br/>
a Fall gathering.  Your webmasters come from CT, PA, PA, MD,VT, VT,NC,<br/>
WA.  I hope you think about this some more and happily join your<br/>
energies and efforts with the rest of us who are having such a good<br/>
time.  Your contributions will be welcomed and appreciated all over the<br/>
country!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Susan in we-just-got-a-frost Vermont<br/>
