                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wanted to let people know.....my friend, here locally in Central Coast, CA.....has her own rubber stamping workshops and stamp business out of her home.  She orders stamps, ink, supplies, etc. at wholesale rates and sells them to other stampers at a discount from retail sources. There are several new products on the market that she has access to and I would like to "show" them all to you.  Some of them, I absolutly love and wonder "Why didn't they think of that before?"  Would the moderator please let me know if it is alright to put pictures in the files regarding the products?  I would like to help her by sharing the products with other stampers....and would like to help all of you to get things at a discount.  I am unsure at this point, if she can get any of the carving rubber.....but she can pretty much get anything else your heart desires for stamping!  I will have her check into order the rubber as well if its a good price and enough people want in on it.  Some of the companies she deals with have minimum orders, for example you must order $150.00 worth of supplies at once, or 2 or 4 sets of markers at a time.  Well, she doesn't need that many herself to order, but she will gather orders together from others, and get a group order going, in able to meet the minimum and still have everyone only purchasing what they actually need or want.  I do not want to step on anyone's toes here, and do not want to advertise the items she gets unless it is alright with the moderator.  If we can do this, I will put pictures of some of the available items in a folder on our group site.....and I will put her contact info in case anyone wants to order.  Is it alright to "advertise" here, basically just by advertising through the photos and giving an email contact to my friend that can order things? Please let me know, thanks!]<br/>

I wanted to let Judy, Sleepy Cat and Princess Lea know that I have received the replacement log book for "OceanO" letterbox and will replant it with the new logbook this weekend and send the orginal logbook on its way to you! *Smiles*  Glad I am close enough to help!<br/>
