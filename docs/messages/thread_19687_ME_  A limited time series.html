created by a group of kids from a summer camp I am director of. I<br/>
introduced these kids to the idea of letterboxing, explaining to them<br/>
what it was about, creating a "dummy" box to show them a bit about<br/>
the hunt and how one might write clues. They have created their own<br/>
boxes, with silhouette stamps that they designed and cut from "fun<br/>
foam". They have hidden the boxes and written clues. The counselors<br/>
have allowed the children to "do their thing". (Wait 'til you see<br/>
the wood they have mounted them on!) The children range in age from 6 <br/>
to 9 or 10 and are very excited about their creations. The boxes are <br/>
all within a fairly small area. I am hoping that if any of you out <br/>
there are going to be boxing on Mount Desert Island in the next three <br/>
weeks you will consider finding these boxes. You would thrill the <br/>
kids if you stamped in! I think there are 20(!!!) of them. They will <br/>
only be around for 3 weeks, as we will pull them on the last day of <br/>
camp (August 20) so that the kids can take them home. My thanks in<br/>
advance to anyone who can stamp in. You will make some very sweet<br/>
kids really happy!<br/>
