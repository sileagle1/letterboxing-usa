from time to time so they'd get a little different environment plus gain a<br/>

any planted in the area.<br/>
<br/>
This was why either Pippi or Keith (usually Keith pushing Pippi) would be<br/>
the ones to actually "grab" the box.<br/>
<br/>
!! Snakes and spiders and bees oh my !!<br/>
<br/>
The children would be rather excited because they were all given jobs.<br/>
Some as CIA sleuths -- posted to be on the lookout for muggles, tho Keith<br/>
was always Sargeant-at-Arms for the group in the vicinity of muggles;<br/>
One as Keeper of the Markers;<br/>
One as Keeper of the Stamp(s);<br/>
Some as Finders of the Best Stamping-in Place so as Not to be Discovered<br/>
While Stamping-in;<br/>
etc.  The number of jobs they came up with depended on how many children<br/>
were along.<br/>
<br/>
They worked at making all the jobs "important."  Sounds kinda dumb but it<br/>
worked with the kids and nobody felt bad that they weren't the actually ones<br/>
to find the box at the very end.  Pippi always seemed to be the one who<br/>
ended up dealing with the snakes and spiders and bees oh my!  I know that,<br/>
even thru gloves, she got at least one extremely nasty spider bite.<br/>
<br/>
And The Great American Yellowjacket Chase was pretty scarey too.  Yellow<br/>
jackets love to nest underground, so they're often not noticeable until<br/>
there's suddenly a thousand of them mad, ugly, and eager to be noticed.  A<br/>
fun time was not had by all that day.<br/>

I don't know that the moral of your story is really to always bring a <br/>
first aid kit. What if there had been a rattlesnake under the bush, <br/>
or a black widow spider (which can be found in Massachusetts) -- not <br/>
to mention what might have happened if one of the kids had been <br/>
previously undiagnosed as allergic to wasp stings?<br/>
<br/>
With all the talk about safety on the list recently, I think it's <br/>
good to reflect on how we can best protect ourselves and our families <br/>
from the potential hazards that come with enjoying the great <br/>
outdoors. I rarely get up on a soapbox, but I think that kids need to <br/>
be properly supervised when they're out in the woods, letterboxing or <br/>
otherwise, and that parents have to teach their kids the proper <br/>
methods of exploring for letterboxes (don't randomly turn over rocks <br/>
and logs, don't reach into dark places without poking a stick in <br/>
first, be respectful of nature and the letterbox, learn how to rehide <br/>
a letterbox properly, etc.). I also don't believe that kids who are <br/>
very young are usually up to the responsibility (speaking as a parent <br/>
myself). There are too many problems that you can encounter outdoors <br/>
for which a first aid kit just isn't going to help you.<br/>
<br/>
Besides having a letterboxer stranded on a cliff, we've had a <br/>
letterboxer who had to be rescued from mud by the fire department -- <br/>
and not too long ago a geocacher tumbled off a cliff and died while <br/>
out by himself seeking a geocache (which could easily have been a <br/>
letterboxer trying to read a clue instead of watching his or her <br/>
step). These are all heartbreaking stories, and I'd be very happy to <br/>
not hear another one in my lifetime....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had an unpleasant experience searching for a box at the Holt Pond<br/>
Preserve in the Raymond/Standish area last summer for the Lakes Region<br/>
Gathering. I've never had an allergic reaction to a sting, but this<br/>
one was a whopper. I got stung so quickly, I barely had a chance to<br/>
see what it was. I was luckily with 2 other folks, Nautilus (who is<br/>
very allergic) and Isosceles. We quickly realized we had disturbed a<br/>
nest of wasps underneath a boardwalk by having walked behind another<br/>
person on the trail. We also realized it was way too late to turn<br/>
around and hike the rest of the mile long loop trail. We bushwacked it<br/>
through the woods and ran all the way back to the car. Needless to<br/>
say, I had a swolen, purple leg for a month afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Having seen a Chinese Herbalist, a Homeopath, and after a whole head<br/>
or two of cabbage leaves later, I have resolved to always carry Apis<br/>
Mellifica pellets with me. This is the homeopathic remedy for stings.<br/>
I cannot recommend this for everyone, nor can I even begin to explain<br/>
how well the cabbage worked (removes toxins from bloodstream), but as<br/>
someone who is certified in CPR and first aid, I would say that yes,<br/>
it might be suggested that you bring even a modified version of a<br/>
first aid kit with you.<br/>
<br/>
If you are stung once, the chances are that you'll be stung again, and<br/>
the next time could trigger an allergic reaction. You do not build<br/>
immunity to all stings. A beekeeper will tell you differently, but in<br/>
the case of wasps, you are better safe than sorry. Carry an epi-pen if<br/>
you have (many) small children, and always make sure you don't send<br/>
them running into the woods to stir up dark piles of detritus and<br/>
other rotting materials. <br/>
