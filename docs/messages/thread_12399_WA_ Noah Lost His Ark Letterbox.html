Noah has lost his ark.  Can you help him find it?<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  As the water was drying up, Noah fell out of the ark.  Noah <br/>
looked around and to his surprise he was at Lake Sacajawea.  It is <br/>
said that Noah built the ark or did he play on it?  But, wait this <br/>
can't be it, the ark is caged in. It can't float.  Noah wasn't sure <br/>
what to do, so he will go and ask God under the arch entrance.  God <br/>
tells Noah to go 250 degrees and he will find the path to lead him <br/>
to the ark.  At the beginning of the path go 67 steps.  It was once <br/>
said that things can always be found in the center of one of three <br/>
trees.<br/>
