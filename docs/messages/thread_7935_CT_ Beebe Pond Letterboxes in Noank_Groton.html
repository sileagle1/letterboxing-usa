                    <html><body>Darrin and I had a very busy weekend!  We had a family reunion at Harkness State Park on Saturday, slept over at the beach house on Sat. night in RI, and went sailing on the family boat from Noank on Sunday.  After sailing, we wearily went through the Beebe Pond boxes before heading out for dinner and then home.  All Beebe Pond boxes were found safe and sound.  Some need new ziplocs though and we didn't have any more:-(.  I hope the water doesn't get inside!
