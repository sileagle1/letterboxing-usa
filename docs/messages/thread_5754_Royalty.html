                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was in the stationary section of Staples the other day and a woman <br/>
and her husband who were looking for invitations asked the clerk if <br/>
they had sealing wax.  I believe that in the old days the king wore a <br/>
ring with his seal on it and when he wrote an official letter he <br/>
melted some wax to seal it and pressed his ring into it to leave an <br/>
impression.  That would be a unique way of stamping.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I just got Wingfoot's Northern NJ mystery box.  It was the <br/>
first place I thought of, but I wasn't sure of the specifics.<br/>
