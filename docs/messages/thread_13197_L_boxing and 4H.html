Thank you for this info! That is a great idea(s) and gives me inspiration to <br/>
come up with some for my boys.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Why not take 2 journals when he goes out.  Then he'd have an original<br/>
for 4-h and one to keep.  I have judged ' 4-H Still Exhibits' for<br/>
several years, and given the choice, I'd rather see an original.  But I<br/>
also know the stuff can become damaged.  It wouldn't take a lot of time<br/>
or money to make a duplicate.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a cool idea for a 4-H project.  I'm going to have to tell<br/>
my friend, who got me into doing the judging.  Except she'll probably<br/>
say, "What a WONDERFUL idea!  Would you Lead it?  And I really do not<br/>
enjoy kids!"<br/>
