  In 2004 (Looking forward)  or maybe fall 2003, A Gathering in<br/>
Columbus, Ohio.  I also was toying with the idea of having it at the State <br/>
Fair.<br/>
<br/>
  I will also be driving a long way as it looks as though I will be living <br/>
in Ravenna Ohio by the time of the outting, So I have a long way to dive for <br/>
the outting.  BUT by then, My Mom will be having Grandson Withdraw so she <br/>
will have christopher that weekend so we can do SI-3 and The Gathering (May <br/>
Bring him to the Gathering, Don;t know yet)<br/>

&gt;I have seen a few messages about the Ohio gathering for this year--I<br/>
&gt;would really like to be able to attend this one (I missed last year's<br/>
&gt;due to my work schedule).It would be great if it could be on a<br/>
&gt;Sunday, and I would drive to the Cincinnati area if that is the place<br/>
&gt;chosen. Since I'm not familiar with Cincinnati I wouldn't really have<br/>
&gt;any good "place" suggestions of my own. East Fork I have been to<br/>
