                    <div class="plaintext-content">You were too short :-)  Just like me.  I literally climbed a foot and a half <br/>
up the wall to find the box.  If I was the last one there, I hid it very <br/>
carefully!<br/>
<br/>
If you need to go back, I have an easy way to get there, without doing the <br/>
whole hike again.  E-mail me privately.<br/>

The box was missing, but I just replaced it. It's in a differant <br/>
hiding spot, but near the same bridge. I've updated the clues on my <br/>
clue page.<br/>
