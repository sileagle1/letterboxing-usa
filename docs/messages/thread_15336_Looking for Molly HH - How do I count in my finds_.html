<br/>
Let's ask the judges for a ruling.... <g><br/>
<br/>
If your friend gave you the HH, it's considered a "hand-off," and it counts <br/>
as a found hitchhiker. Occasionally, handing off a hitchhiker is even <br/>
considered good form. For instance, if the original finder isn't able to <br/>
promptly drop off the hitchhiker in a new letterbox, it's far better to <br/>
hand off the hitchhiker to another letterboxer, rather than have the hiker <br/>
sit in a backpack or desk drawer for weeks or months.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you never actually took possession of the hitchhiker, i.e., you <br/>
stamped the hitchhiker in your journal but the original finder kept the <br/>
hitchhiker to plant on another day. In that case, I don't think it counts <br/>
as much of anything. It's not that different from a situation where your <br/>
friend carved a new stamp and let you take an image before he/she planted <br/>
it. In that case, you couldn't really count it as a "find" because you <br/>
didn't find it; you can't count it as an exchange because you can only <br/>
exchange stamps with people (and occasionally dogs who have their own <br/>
personal stamps). It's definitely not a "plant" or an "event," so maybe you <br/>
can invent another letter for your PFX count, such as M for "mooched"....<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm.... maybe we need to see the instant replay on this one after all....<br/>
<br/>

I've had this happen to me on a few occassions. Far as<br/>
I'm concerned, it's an F. A really easy one, but an F<br/>
nonetheless. As always, YMMV.<br/>

Count it however, you feel best about it.  Often at gatherings people share hitchhikers with everyone there.  It really isn't a big deal.  So just enjoy.<br/>

Every person that stamps in and gets it's image all count it as a find. Friends also let each other stamp into them as is your case. We all count them as finds. At least thats what I see here in Eastern CT and RI. It happens all the time. Now more importantly. We are very anxious to get a hold of the Looking for Molly HH. The Molly Looking for Ginger HH has been returned and is here waiting for the "Looking for Molly HH". When both are here and together, we are going to hold a letterboxing gathering and both hitchhikers will be available for stamping along with the many exchanges and a few new boxes planted in the area. It will be held either in Mansfield or a nearby town. Any assistance in getting it here will be greatly appreciated. We have several people anxious for the event trying to track it down. Come on Ginger, Molly is here waiting for<br/>
 you.....Chuck and Molly Mansfield CT<br/>
