Out of curiosity, what do you all take with you when you go out <br/>
letterboxing?  My husband and I realized this weekend that some extra <br/>
plastic bags to replace any damaged/wet/dirty ones we found would be <br/>
good, and some wipes to take the inkstains off of our fingers would <br/>
also help.  We also realized that bug spray is essential!<br/>
<br/>
So what's in your "kit"?<br/>

only in beachy areas in the sand...  not out in the woods)<br/>

- gps &amp; spare batteries<br/>
- cell phone<br/>
- id card<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to point out the last item...  I often letterbox alone <br/>
and being female, do not carry a wallet, and of course do not take my <br/>
purse in the woods with me.  I made up a small laminated ID card with <br/>
emergency contact information that I carry in my backpack.  This way, <br/>
heaven forbid, if something should happen to me on the trail, <br/>
somebody will know who I am and who to contact.<br/>

&gt; Out of curiosity, what do you all take with you when you go out <br/>
&gt; letterboxing?  My husband and I realized this weekend that some <br/>
extra <br/>
&gt; plastic bags to replace any damaged/wet/dirty ones we found would <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; good, and some wipes to take the inkstains off of our fingers would <br/>
&gt; also help.  We also realized that bug spray is essential!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what's in your "kit"?<br/>
<br/>
I have two kits - one for long treks and one for drivebys.  The <br/>
driveby kit is a belted bag which contains only my journal, stamp, <br/>
inkpad, pen, cell phone, and the clues.  And a spot for my keys.  <br/>
When I go on a long trek, I put the belted bag inside the long trek <br/>
kit.  Inside the long trek kit, I have:<br/>
<br/>
Several dozen ziplock bags of various sizes<br/>
Several dozen pens<br/>
Two or three bound index card pads<br/>
One stamp marked "Temporary" in case I ever find a box and the stamp <br/>
is missing - I would leave that in the box when I left.  I keep it in <br/>
the traditional size rubbermaid container in the event of a need for <br/>
replacement<br/>
Large black permanent felt marker<br/>
Several garbage bags<br/>
A length of rope<br/>
2 bungee cords<br/>
A swiss army knife<br/>
Avon sunscreen/insect repellent<br/>
A travel size package of tissues (aka toilet paper)<br/>
A pair of crappy old bib overalls<br/>
Several large elastics<br/>
Several packs of disposable orange safety vests (but I still don't <br/>
throw them away)<br/>
A couple of disposable rain ponchos<br/>
An extra pair of socks<br/>
A disposable camera<br/>
A compass<br/>
A small first aid kit<br/>
A small but industrial strength pair of tweezers (for ticks)<br/>
A travel size package of diaper wipes<br/>
A can of mace<br/>
A pair of binoculars<br/>
A water bottle<br/>
A set of needlenosed pliers (for errant bits of wire)<br/>
A flashlight<br/>
Batteries for the flashlight (kept separately)<br/>
<br/>
I'm probably forgetting something ....<br/>

Water<br/>
Snack (granola bars or something similar)<br/>
Extra ziplock bags in 2 or 3 sizes<br/>
a Tupperware container to use as a replacement if necessary<br/>
Carving materials &amp; Carving tools<br/>
Wet paper towels<br/>
Dry paper towels<br/>
Trash bags (can be used as a ground cloth to sit on, as well as for trash)<br/>
Bandana<br/>
ID<br/>
Bug spray (currently out - need to buy a new container!)<br/>
<br/>
After reading the replies I think I will also add a spare pair of socks.  I may also leave a change of shoes in the car.<br/>
<br/>
I also sometimes carry a walking stick, when I remember to bring it.<br/>

Looking forward to other good ideas!<br/>

If I am searching in an area that has a lot of traffic (foot or car) I can walk around looking in bushes and people will think I am looking for trash.  I usually do find trash so I throw it in the bag.  It can't hurt to do a little cleanup work while out having fun.  : )<br/>
<br/>
I have recently also started carrying a camera.  This is also nice to have when people look at you funny when you are somewhere unusual.  I started doing this after I was going for the Eaton Canyon Hummingbird.  It was way up high on a hill.  A woman kept looking at me while I was up there.  I had my GPS receiver with me.  I pretended it was a camera and that I was up there to take a picture.  She actually moved so that she wouldn't be in my shot!<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] What's in your LB backpack?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Out of curiosity, what do you all take with you when you go out <br/>
  letterboxing?  My husband and I realized this weekend that some extra <br/>
  plastic bags to replace any damaged/wet/dirty ones we found would be <br/>
  good, and some wipes to take the inkstains off of our fingers would <br/>
  also help.  We also realized that bug spray is essential!<br/>
<br/>
  So what's in your "kit"?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lots of good ideas from folks, many of which our team uses as well.  We're <br/>
moving to a 2-backpack system - one regular size backpack with everything <br/>
we might conceivably need while letterboxing, then a couple small, <br/>
purse-sized ones which we load from the big pack with whatever we think we <br/>
might need for a particular box.  I also always have my purse with me, and <br/>
when needed move the first-aid kit, chapstick, pain killer, etc I always <br/>
carry into the small backpack.  We carry 6 Kaleidacolor dye ink pads (4 on <br/>
one baggie and 1 for each of our 2 family stamps which ride in baggies with <br/>
the stamps), which gives an ENORMOUS range of colors as well as beautiful, <br/>
variegated stamped images.  A "light pack" for a short walk includes log, <br/>
personal stamp, a couple pens, all 6 ink pads and a baggie with a couple <br/>
wet paper towels for cleaning what are increasingly "gunky" box stamps.<br/>
