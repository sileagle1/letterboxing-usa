Sounds like you're talking GPS to me!  Try the Garmin Etrex Summit.  It has<br/>
a built-in compass - not sure how accurate it is though, and it has an<br/>
altimeter too.  Except for the compass part, it won't help much with<br/>
locating LetterBoxes.  Really, a simpler compass with a movable bezel will<br/>
be quite adequate.  I'm sure many on this list can give recommendations for<br/>
compasses which work well.<br/>
<br/>
But here's a link to Garmin in case you're intrigued:<br/>

Then click the product comparison link at the bottom of the page<br/>

all together. I've found about 12 boxes around the CapeCod <br/>
Massachusetts area and am getting ready to plant my first box. I'm <br/>
having a blast and my kids enjoy it too...they all had to have their <br/>
own stamps.<br/>
I look forward to checking in here often, and am glad i found this <br/>
