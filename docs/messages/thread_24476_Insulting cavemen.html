I always have cards stock around to use for the inside pages. As far as the cover goes, you need to get a material thinner than 1/4 inches as that is all you can use when sliding the material into the cutting section. I usually save Kleenex boxes or other thinner cardboard boxes from products that I buy and glue fancy papers or scrap-booking paper to it for covers. It takes all of 10 seconds to bind the book together. Even a Caveman can do it! I never have to buy another logbook for myself or for my boxes again.<br/>
