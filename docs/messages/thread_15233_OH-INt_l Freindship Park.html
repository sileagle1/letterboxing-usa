                    <div class="plaintext-content">Gathered the gang around bright and early this morning and bribed with a<br/>
promise of Honey Buns, loaded into the car to hit IFP. Tooling down Columbia<br/>
Parkway at 9:30 in the am--no traffic but blazing sun, so of course I miss<br/>
my exit. I am sure it had nothing to do with the music behind me. "Jesus<br/>
wants me for a Sunbeam sung at the top of 6yo lungs, accompanied by tinny<br/>
electronic xylophone version of "old MacDonald" played at a speed that makes<br/>
one hting of ALvin and the Chipmunks on Ritalin, and the baby singing<br/>
cheerfully "nah nah nah nah...heyayy, bye-bye"<br/>
<br/>
Am I insane? Am I Possessed? Yeah--I need that Fcount in the double digits!!<br/>
<br/>
Slight back-tracking, and I find the lot easily, park in the shade and stuff<br/>
babe (barefoot--no lost shoes here!)into the new Kelty (complete with price<br/>
tag stil lattached just in case we decide we hate it and I want to return<br/>
it) Happy snuffling noises reassure me and we begin reading the clues.<br/>
<br/>
 these are excellent for the family! Kids got to do a alot, flag<br/>
indentification, counting--reading!<br/>
<br/>
Find Tall Stacks easily, stamp in (no pen in my pack, grrr...apparently<br/>
Butterfly Girl swiped yet another one) and continue to the next box. Love<br/>
looking at the "fossils" along the way. Couple of false starts for Little<br/>
Hummer--mom can't be bothered reaidng the clues completely--and once we<br/>
locate the location, I about give up but Happy Frog is determined and we<br/>
find it! Humdinger of a location! Would say more, but no spoilers!!<br/>
<br/>
Only one more to go! Pass a couple of artists (real artists--paints and<br/>
easels and all--with Happy Frog reminding me not to tell everyone we are on<br/>
a secret treasrue hunt and Butterfly Girl remdinding me she wansts to attend<br/>
Clown COllege so she can be a balloon artist when she grows up) and I point<br/>
out a very realistic turtle statue. Happy Frog checks it out--and it moves!!<br/>
Butterfly girl joins him and we find out that turtles are capable of decent<br/>
speeds when pursued by enthusiastic youngsters. Finally convince Butterfly<br/>
Girl to put Mr. T back into the garden area, and proceed on the way to the<br/>
IFP box.<br/>
<br/>
See a couple walking their daschunds (sp??--weiner dogs)--Kids proclaim them<br/>
Happy Dog 1 and Happy Dog 2, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Butterfly girl is the star of this one--locates it, does a bit of balancing,<br/>
overcoming a few fears along the way, and we are happily stamping in in no<br/>
time!! BG returns the box to the hiding place, we check out the rest of the<br/>
Park and head home, hot, and happy. Once in the car, I noitce the back of my<br/>
hair is a bit sticky--apparently the happy snuffling of the Chickadee meant<br/>
her stuffy nose had finally given way. Euwww! Add Baseball Cap to my mental<br/>
list of things to pack in my bag....<br/>
<br/>
This is a nice park--well worth the trip. Kids enjoyed it despite no<br/>
playground (bribed agian with Shakes on the way home after meeting daddy for<br/>
lunch and sharing our adventure). Lots to look at--and the river is<br/>
gorgeous! Stamps were great as well--Little Hummer was the family favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Now, where to travel this weekend to increase that count??<br/>
