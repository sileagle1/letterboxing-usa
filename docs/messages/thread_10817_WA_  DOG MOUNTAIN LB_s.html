wildflowers this time of year, but also, not the crowds that swarm the<br/>
place Spring and Summer, either.  The only snow was on the east side at<br/>
the top and it was old.<br/>
<br/>
Dog Mountain is a steep mother!  It was a wonderful hike, though, and,<br/>
certainly, once we were up near and to the summit we were rewarded with<br/>
delightful letterboxes placed by Funhog and Ryan!  Both are doing very<br/>
well.  <br/>
<br/>
Had a great time.  Thanks for the incentive to make this challenging<br/>
journey.  Agony of the feet, but victory of the letterboxes!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

P.S.  Mt. Defiance here I come...a few months<br/>
down the road when snow is not a factor.<br/>
