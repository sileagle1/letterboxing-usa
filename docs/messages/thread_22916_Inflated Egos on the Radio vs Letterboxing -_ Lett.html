 First of all, I download and listened the the NPR broadcast. It was a good<br/>
interview as you had to understand what they were doing all while on the<br/>
raido and not being able to see anything. This was done very nice and I got a <br/>
feel for what  they were doing. So if I were new to the hobby, it sounded like <br/>
real fun.  A+ Interview for our hobby!<br/>
<br/>
 Second. I do not know any of the players in this topic, The Guy in the interview<br/>
nor moon the poster of this tread.<br/>
<br/>
First of all you can not limit the new people to the hobby. If "YOU" feel we need <br/>
less letterboxers, then "YOU" need to quit and make room for a person to come in<br/>
and have fun and take "YOUR" place. You always want new people. I want new<br/>
people as you only log a box once. So what would the point be in leaving a box if we have limited people looking for it. Heck if it was limited we would meet<br/>
at Joe's house once a month and stamp up and go home and never lose a<br/>
single box.  But that's not the fun.....<br/>
<br/>
The more you have that take up this hobby (YES) the more boxes you will lose.<br/>

<br/>
How's the new job going? I'm sorry that I missed you at <br/>
the RI Mystery Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you would like me to plant a box for you up <br/>
this way. Goldsmith Woodlands in Andover could use a few <br/>
more now that the Pensylvania Hex series has moved on to <br/>
another location.<br/>
