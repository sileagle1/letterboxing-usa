Hi,<br/>
Aren't some of the older boxes, b/4 the clues were available on the web (old EMS), likely to <br/>
fall into this category? Also. old never found DMS stuff?, and didn't Wanda and Pete say old <br/>
boxes had been moved around b/c folks didn't understand the game as well back then?  <br/>
Might be one in some bush in the backcountry. <br/>
<br/>
I bet the oldest unfound box would be in the 1997-98 range. But I have NO CLUE what it <br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sure would like to know, just for history lessons.<br/>
<br/>

PS-Good question!<br/>

Our guess would be that Randy likely owns the oldest untouched boxes. <br/>
Many of the Mapsurfer Treasure boxes have yet to be found.... <br/>
hopefully we'll find one of these treasure boxes in our career!<br/>
