&gt; Not to complain, mind you, but I asked some time back to be removed<br/>
&gt;  from the group mailing list ..... yet mail keeps pouring in.  Did I do<br/>
&gt;  something wrong?  <br/>
&gt;       Maybe there's something to do at my end to stop the e-mail? <br/>
&gt;       Really its nothing against you guys.  Heck I'd love to keep<br/>
&gt;  reading all the notes you all send around, especially now that things<br/>
&gt;  are sounding a bit more positive....... but they come in on my work<br/>
&gt;  machine (17 today) and it becomes pretty disruptive. <br/>

I have removed you from the list.  Thanks for your participation, and I hope <br/>
you'll join us again soon.  For the record, I see no evidence that you have <br/>
posted anything to the list asking to be removed, so I'm not sure who you <br/>
contacted.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who wishes to be removed from the list can do this instantly by <br/>
sending any message to the address:<br/>
letterbox-usa-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Mitch Klink, talk list co-manager<br/>
