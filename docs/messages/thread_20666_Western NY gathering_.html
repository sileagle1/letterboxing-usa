Much as we like to head east for fun, we'd like to have people try <br/>
heading west for a change! :-)<br/>
<br/>
If we had a gathering somewhere between Rochester and Buffalo, would <br/>
anyone be interested in joining us? Still kinda of unsure about it, <br/>
but there's boxes a-plenty to get and lots to do and see (Niagara <br/>
Falls being a pretty big one!)<br/>

Sure, host it the week of Thanksgiving and I'll be there ... I'll be <br/>
back home (Canandiagua) for the holiday anyway!<br/>

I'm still looking forward to placing a few boxes in my boyhood <br/>

Better get here quick, then!  If you had told me last year there'd be<br/>
this many letterboxers in WNY, I'd have said you were crazy.  It<br/>
wasn't that long ago that I was the sole boxer and had to find boxes<br/>
on my travels.<br/>
