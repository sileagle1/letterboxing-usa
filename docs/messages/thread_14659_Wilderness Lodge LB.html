granddaughters and I found the Wilderness Lodge letterbox.  As one <br/>
LB'er had written in the log book...it was great having something <br/>
else to do that didn't involve a mouse and a $2.50 bottle of water!  <br/>
LOL  It was in great shape and a nice walk, too!  Some other LB'ers <br/>
had signed the book just that day (July 20), so apparently we just <br/>
missed meeting fellow LB'ers.  Thanks - enjoyed the box!<br/>
