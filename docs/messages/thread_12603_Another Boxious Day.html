decided to take a Whimsy of a walk, then found three bridges, a French garden <br/>
and a half of H's Bad literary piece.  Couldn't find the other three bridges, <br/>
and the first half of the literary piece.  Any clues from anyone?  Other than <br/>
the fact that I didn't find all of the boxes I was looking for, all the boxes <br/>
were intact and fine :-)  <br/>
<br/>
BTW.... Jay:  Some of your above boxes don't have ink.... I don't know if <br/>
that was intentional or not :-)<br/>
<br/>
Off to NYC tomorrow with the All-State Kids!  They're playing outside of <br/>
Lincoln Center!<br/>
