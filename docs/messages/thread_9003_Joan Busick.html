  I called a couple times and left a message with your daughter.  Sorry I didn't get through to you.<br/>
<br/>
Town Hall has already placed your order and can't return you check.<br/>
<br/>
The merit badge order that I sent in which included 5 badges from you is not completed.  She expects to have it  done next week.<br/>
<br/>
Andrea at Town Hall is very sweet lady, please be patient with her as Town Hall is not a large company.  I am positive they don't intend to gouge us.  The amount of money they make on these patches probably barely covers the time they have spent dealing with us letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
I did contact Accent INC.  Thank you for the information.  I sent them an email to get a price on the logo patch.  Of course they cannot sell patch quantities of less than 50 either but since they do produce the patches it should be cheaper.  <br/>
If anything useful comes out of it I'll contact the webmasters to change the order form info.<br/>
It would not be feasible to have them make our merit badges even though it would be cheaper.  Accent will not make less than 50 of each denomination at a time and I cannot afford to front the bill for that many merit badges (P,F and X of 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 500 &amp; 1000  each).  We will stick to Town Hall for those, especially since we were just able to cover the original set up fee and have been able to lower the price.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks do much for your help,<br/>
<br/>
