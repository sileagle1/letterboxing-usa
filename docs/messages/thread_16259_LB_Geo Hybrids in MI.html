                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from Guelph, Ontario, where I checked for the availability of Letterboxes (to find none) before leaving, however, upon arriving and checking for some local geocaches, I found a hybrid.  <br/>
I liked the way they did this, and I'm going to do a lot of these in the future, in hopes of converting some geocachers (which are many) over to letterboxing (which is more fun!), so they'll plant more boxes in my area. <br/>
<br/>
The cacher listed the cache as a hybrid and stated the coordinates for the cache, with an explaination of letterboxing on the page, and a link to the letterbox's page, and LBNA site.  The cache was just a normal cache, but inside it was a zip-loc baggie with the directions to the letterbox.  This way, people who aren't interested in letterboxing don't have to go there.  Also, geocachers who don't understand the mechanics of letterboxing won't take off with the stamp and stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
I recently placed a hybrid in Alberta, Canada that was like a virtual cache (no exchange), but when you got to the location of the coordinates, you followed the clues (hints) that were given on the cache page, to find the box.  There were all kinds of warnings and reminders that this next part of the journey was just for letterboxers, etc. but I still worried that it would be accidentally plundered by inexperienced cachers.  The way they did it in Guelph, seemed pretty foolproof and fun, and when I logged in to record my cache find, I read all of the comments which said things like, "I never knew about letterboxing... This seems like a lot of fun... I'm going to carve a stamp!...  I'm going to try this...  etc.<br/>
<br/>
My only question is why they didn't separately post the clues on the letterbox pages.  I didn't see anything about this box when I looked for some prior to my trip.<br/>
