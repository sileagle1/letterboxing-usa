up with observations of his own) discovered this box after a slightly <br/>
off-course search. We also disturbed some sunbathers/fisherpeople who <br/>
appeared to resent our brief intrusion on "their" space. The box and its <br/>
contents were in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
Saw lots of evidence of some busy beavers along the shore, with downed <br/>
trees and soon-to-be-downed trees all around. This was a great hike for <br/>
little kids, with just a few off-trail, high brush areas. Watch out for the <br/>
sting nettles, though - there were lots.<br/>
<br/>
Nice bathrooms in the park, too - always a plus when traveling with little <br/>
ones only recently out of diapers. :-)<br/>
