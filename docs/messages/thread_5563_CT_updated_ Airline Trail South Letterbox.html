<p>Route 2 to Letterbox; 1  miles</p><b>
</b><p>Difficulty: Easy. This old railroad bed consists of stonedust.</p><b>

<p>Take Route 66 to East Hampton. Go South on Route 196 for almost half a mile. 
Take a left </p>

<p>onto Flanders Road, go a quarter mile. Turn right on Smith Road. On your left 
will be a small pond with a parking area. </p><b>
</b><p>To start in Amston: </p>
<p>Take Route 85 between Hebron and Colchester to the Amston section, this is 
about a half mile South of Route 207. There is a parking area located on the 
western side of Route 85 next to the <b><i>Route 85 Lumber</i></b> 
store.</p></dir></dir></dir></dir>

</b><p>East Hampton: The trail starts at <b><i>Cranberry Meadow</i></b>, next to 
<i>Cranberry Bog</i>. This area was once a natural cranberry producing bog. 
After about 1  miles youll come to <b><i>Rapallo Viaduct</i></b>. This was 
originally a railroad bridge built in 1873 and spanning 1,380 feet, 60 feet 
above <i>Flat Brook</i>. However, in 1913, the span was filled in because the 
bridge could no longer carry the weight of the new freight trains. At 2  miles 
youll cross the<b> <i>Lyman Viaduct</i></b>. This was once a 1,108 foot 
railroad bridge crossing 137 feet high over <i>Dickinsons Brook</i>. This was 
also filled in around 1913. At approximately 3 miles, youll come to a parking 
area. The trail continues across Bull Hill Road. You may wish to take a side 
trip to see the <b><i>Comstock Covered Bridge</i></b> that crosses the 
<i>Salmon</i> <i>River</i>. Go right down Bull Hill Road approximately 1  
miles. Continuing along the trail, after almost 5 miles youll cross <i>River 
Road Bridge</i>. Built in 1887, this 22 foot long brownstone arch bridge 
traversed what is now a paved River Road. Right after this bridge, youll come 
to a second newly built wooden bridge that crosses high above the <i>Salmon 
River</i>. Cross the bridge and take a small trail on the left side that goes 
down along the bridge embankment. About halfway down youll see a large 
perpendicular hole in the stonework. If you look up into the hole youll find 
the Letterbox. You may continue along the trail for another 3 miles to find a 
second Letterbox (see <b>Airline Trail Letterbox</b>) or even take the trail to 
its ending in Amston after another 6 miles. Continuing on, after about 6  
miles from East Hampton, youll come to a commuter parking lot just off of Route 
2. If you parked at the <b>Route 2 commuter lot</b>, just reverse these 
instructions to find the Letterbox. From the commuter lot, travel under Route 2 
on Route 149 to the stop sign and take a right. At the bottom of this small 
hill, on your left, the trail picks up again. Less then a mile youll cross over 
a steel bridge which traverses high over <i>Jeremy River</i>. A second Letterbox 
is hidden here (see <b>Airline Trail Letterbox</b>). A hop, skip and a jump 
brings you to a wooden bridge over the same river. At 10 miles youll encounter 
<b><i>Raymond Brook Marsh</i></b>. Full of lilypads, beaver huts and wildlife. 
Beautiful. After 11 miles you reach the parking lot in Amston. To start in 
<b>Amston</b>, simply reverse these instructions. They have recently improved 
another mile of the trail from Amston towards Willimantic, where the trail is 
eventually supposed to hook up with the Hop River Trail. Lebanon has been doing 
trail work on their section.</p></dir></dir></dir></dir><b>
</b><p>Note: The Towns of East Hampton, Colchester and Hebron (Amston) have 
available a map of</p>
<p>the Airline Trail along with its history that I was able to incorporate into 
my Letterbox</p>
<p>instructions.</p>
