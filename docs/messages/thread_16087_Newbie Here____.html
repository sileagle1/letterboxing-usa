                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings everyone!  I must admit that I have alot to learn about <br/>
this hobby ... but it is great fun so far.  I still need to carve a <br/>
stamp (or have one made) so for the time being I am using a couple of <br/>
my favorite small stamps to mark logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Seems that there aren't too many boxes in Northern Kentucky, but I'm <br/>
close the Cincinnati, OH and I see there are many hidden in that <br/>
area.  My husband and I went on our first search yesterday ... and <br/>
were delighted to find both of the boxes we had clues to find.<br/>
<br/>
We plan to create a box of our own soon!  Do many of you include <br/>
return postcards or just label the box to contact when found etc?<br/>
<br/>
Smiles!<br/>

Welcome to this addicting hobby.  I hope you will enjoy it as much <br/>
as the rest of us.<br/>
In Connecticut, most people just stamp into the log book.  I have <br/>
adopted a few boxes, and I go look at the log to see who has <br/>
visited.  I haven't seen return postcards in boxes in this area.  I <br/>
do put my e-mail address in the log book, and the web site has a <br/>
link from the clue page to send an email to the placer (that's me).  <br/>
I haven't got any email back, but I only adopted the boxes in the <br/>
last few months.<br/>
Happy boxing.<br/>
