<br/>
You schlepped out for miles, scrambled up a hill, poked around in some bushes for a good hiding spot, placed the box, took some compass readings, counted paces, wrote it all down then....<br/>
<br/>
LOST THE DIRECTIONS!!!<br/>
<br/>
I lost the directions to a box I planted last weekend.  Curses!  I marked the coordinates with a GPS so I will have no trouble finding the box again but it is frustrating that I will have to hike back up there and repace everything.  : P<br/>
<br/>
There was someone who mentioned writing everything in their journal including plants.  Sound like a great idea to me right about now.  : (<br/>
