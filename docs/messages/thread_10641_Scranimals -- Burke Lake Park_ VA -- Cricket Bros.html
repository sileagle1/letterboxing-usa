Thank you!  Yay!  I'm so glad to hear that you liked it and the boxes were well hidden!  I am planning on more Scranimals boxes there.  As you read, the Mangorilla is usually accompanied by the Orangutangerine and I had planned to do the Radishark as well, which will have to wait for better weather due to my plans for its placement.  I was gratefully surprised (that's gloating, triumphant gratitude) to see that no one else had got to that park yet because it's a good spot.
