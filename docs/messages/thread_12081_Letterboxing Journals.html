&gt; What do you folks put in your journals?<br/>
<br/>
My original journal was just a 9"x6" sketch book.  I put everything <br/>
in it chronologically -- finds, plants (and would have put exchanges <br/>
there also, had there been any), notes on locations, weather, PFX <br/>
tracking, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I found I didn't like keeping my plants in with everything else, <br/>
because putting everything chronologically, I wasn't leaving myself <br/>
enough space to come back later and make notes on a box if I did <br/>
maintenance or had to replace it, etc.  Other times I would stamp a <br/>
prospective "plant" into the book, leave the house to put it out and <br/>
not find a good spot where I was hoping to place it, and would have <br/>
to go back with it another day...  So the chronological order thing <br/>
often got messed up.<br/>
<br/>
Since the original sketch book filled, at the beginning of 2003 I <br/>
started a new log book, this time a nice leather "antique looking" <br/>
kind of book, a little smaller than the first.  But I am only using <br/>
it for finds, exchanges and notes this time around.  With each find, <br/>
I record the date, box name and box location, date placed and <br/>
planter, and then generally jot down a few notes about the location <br/>
or the weather or how many people have been to the box (if it a very <br/>
full log book), and note the "F" number in the corner of the page.<br/>
<br/>
I have started tracking plants on 4x6 index cards with stamp and <br/>
basic info on the front and room for lots of notes on the ruled <br/>
backs.  These then go into an archival quality photo album, with 2 - <br/>
4x6 sleeves per page.  Sometimes I also insert a photo or two of the <br/>
park or location where the box was planted.<br/>
<br/>
The few virtuals I have done, I have printed onto postcards and put <br/>
into the back of the photo album that has plants in.  I don't count <br/>
virtuals as "finds" therefore, don't put them into my boxing journal.<br/>
<br/>
This seems to be working well for me.<br/>

<br/>
I'm using a 72-page Canson journal with a soft black, bonded leather cover. <br/>
It's 7.5" x 5.5", so it's a bit bigger than 4x6.<br/>
http://www.canson-us.com/journals_details.asp#05<br/>
<br/>
The paper is a nice weight, though some might prefer a heavier paper. I got <br/>
it at either Borders or B&amp;N.<br/>
<br/>
Canson does make a "Basic Sketch Book" in the 4x6 size, with 216 pages, (I <br/>
don't know what the cover is like, though):<br/>

  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; &gt; What do you folks put in your journals?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; My original journal was just a 9"x6" sketch book.  I put everything<br/>
  &gt; in it chronologically -- finds, plants (and would have put<br/>
  exchanges<br/>
  &gt; there also, had there been any), notes on locations, weather, PFX<br/>
  &gt; tracking, etc...<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I found I didn't like keeping my plants in with everything else,<br/>
  &gt; because putting everything chronologically, I wasn't leaving myself<br/>
  &gt; enough space to come back later and make notes on a box if I did<br/>
  &gt; maintenance or had to replace it, etc.  Other times I would stamp a<br/>
  &gt; prospective "plant" into the book, leave the house to put it out<br/>
  and<br/>
  &gt; not find a good spot where I was hoping to place it, and would have<br/>
  &gt; to go back with it another day...  So the chronological order thing<br/>
  &gt; often got messed up.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Since the original sketch book filled, at the beginning of 2003 I<br/>
  &gt; started a new log book, this time a nice leather "antique looking"<br/>
  &gt; kind of book, a little smaller than the first.  But I am only using<br/>
  &gt; it for finds, exchanges and notes this time around.  With each<br/>
  find,<br/>
  &gt; I record the date, box name and box location, date placed and<br/>
  &gt; planter, and then generally jot down a few notes about the location<br/>
  &gt; or the weather or how many people have been to the box (if it a<br/>
  very<br/>
  &gt; full log book), and note the "F" number in the corner of the page.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I have started tracking plants on 4x6 index cards with stamp and<br/>
  &gt; basic info on the front and room for lots of notes on the ruled<br/>
  &gt; backs.  These then go into an archival quality photo album, with 2 -<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; 4x6 sleeves per page.  Sometimes I also insert a photo or two of<br/>
  the<br/>
  &gt; park or location where the box was planted.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; The few virtuals I have done, I have printed onto postcards and put<br/>
  &gt; into the back of the photo album that has plants in.  I don't count<br/>
  &gt; virtuals as "finds" therefore, don't put them into my boxing<br/>
  journal.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; This seems to be working well for me.<br/>
