<div>What a beautiful day!!</div>
<div>We took the bikes over to William Haalcks' 
Collinsville section of this wonderful rail to trail. We rode the trail 
backwards from the Rt 4/179 parking lot. We were quite surprised to see that we 
were the first to stamp in. Upon returning from the old railroad trestle, I 
spotted an individual returning the box to its hiding spot off in the distance. 
We all stopped and introduced ourselves to David "The Sugarmaker" and 
family. What a great surprise. Seems Davis is a buddy of Alan from Axtown. Small 
world we live in. Thanks for the exchanges David, Rebecca and Robbie. Our X 
count is catching our F count. So nice to meet all of you. We look 
forward to your upcoming series (that's all I'm going to say).
