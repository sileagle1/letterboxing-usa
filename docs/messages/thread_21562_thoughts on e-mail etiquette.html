Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I'm the list manager.  Many new people don't know be because I don't post<br/>
too often.  Always good advice IMO, but I'll throw in some thoughts on <br/>
list etiquette, FWIW.<br/>
<br/>
The list is moderated by unpaid volunteers.  That means some of the work<br/>
of running the list smoothly is off-loaded onto each poster.  In English,<br/>
that means you have to volunteer to moderate yourself and make sure you <br/>
don't post anything uncivil, as the real moderators are busy dealing with<br/>
spam, porn, and other nonsense beyond the control of list subscribers.<br/>
<br/>
Like yours, their lives are too hectic to have to deal with stuff _under <br/>
the control_ of fellow list members.  This is supposed to be a lightly<br/>
commercial, volunteer, open community, not many rules, and all that good <br/>
stuff.  This means some of the work to make it run smoothly is off-loaded <br/>
to everyone, meaning moderate yourself and don't take quick offense.  That <br/>
is about the extent of your required work around here.<br/>
<br/>
There are two good ways to moderate yourself, especially if you have a<br/>
history of getting into fights on e-mail (and you know who you are).<br/>
<br/>
First, wait an hour before posting anything that may be construed as <br/>
uncivil -- try to anticipate if you will have poster's regret the next <br/>
day (many trolls don't, but these folks are usually easy to clean off <br/>
lists) -- and then just hit the delete key rather than the send key.  <br/>
<br/>
Second, when reading another e-mail which you construe as uncivil <br/>
(something that is easy to do even if there is no such intent by the <br/>
poster), try to find a civil construction or intent by the sender<br/>
anyway.  If not, if you must, respond off-list, but better yet, let<br/>
it go.  You'll feel that warm feeling of self-satisfaction of being <br/>
able to rise above the pettiness, and even if you don't, you won't gain <br/>
anything by posting anyway in these circumstances.  Simply configure your<br/>
e-mail program to drop that sender into your spam folder for the future<br/>
(most modern e-mail software provides mechanisms to easily do this).<br/>
<br/>
My philosophy is to be as open as possible with the moderation policy.<br/>
Lets try to keep it that way.  One thing to note is that I'm not a big<br/>
believer in warning individuals, or placing them on moderation.  I<br/>
prefer to just ban them without warning.  The reason for this is simple --<br/>
Individual warnings and placement on moderation create unnecessary work<br/>
for the volunteer moderators.  Banning does not -- a couple of clicks<br/>
and the problem goes away.  Volunteers should not be forced to take time <br/>
out of _their_ busy schedule because _you_ can't be civil.  Other <br/>
moderators may be less hard-line on this, that is their choice -- all<br/>
moderators have quite a bit of latitude as to how the list is run.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, there is a reason people construe e-mail to be uncivil when<br/>
the same thing would not happen in person, or even over the phone.<br/>
I cut the dissertation as I don't feel like defending the scientific<br/>
ideas invoked (which in some cases are contested) or providing <br/>
references -- but always keep in mind that people construe e-mail to<br/>
be threatening when it is not intended to be.  It is easy to do, so<br/>
think about it when reading -- do I have _evidence_ that the writer's<br/>
intent is threatening or to be uncivil, and as a writer -- how likely<br/>
is this to be construed as threatening or uncivil (but in my personal<br/>
opinion, most flame problems initiate from an initial misconstrual on <br/>
the part of a reader, not by intent of a writer (list trolls excepted, <br/>
but usually a different and obvious case).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>
