Hi,<br/>
I made it to 2 of your Folsom Kids' Park boxes yesterday (snake &amp; <br/>
gecko) &amp; found that the books that had what I felt were inappropriate <br/>
messages in them. Based on the handwritting, it looked like a junior <br/>
high aged kid "stamped" in &amp; wrote unpleasant &amp; derogatory things <br/>
about someone they knew. They also wrote rude comments on other pages <br/>
where people had already stamped. Just wanted to let you know so you <br/>
could deal with it as appropriate.  I'd be happy to help with them if <br/>
you're unavailable.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Black Cavalier<br/>
