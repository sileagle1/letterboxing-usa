just heard from Ryan this morning. He was in Pearisburg, VA (621 <br/>
miles and counting). He is currently averaging about 18-20 miles a <br/>
day. At this rate, he will probably make Harper's Ferry by June 24-<br/>
25th. It's the middle of the week, so that might put a damper on <br/>
gathering plans. He will probably be at Front Royal, VA the previous <br/>
WEEKEND. June 20-21. So that might be a better bet for trying to get <br/>
together with folks. <br/>
<br/>
(you got to remember, I know when he'll be taking zero days! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I am meeting with him June 12-15 in Waynesboro, VA (near <br/>
Charlottesville)--I will be making him "slack pack" for a couple of <br/>
days in that area too. <br/>
And I will be letterboxing while he is busy hiking. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested in meeting up with me and Ryan the weekend of June <br/>
14th in the Charlottesville area can email me off list. For making <br/>
plans in the Front Royal area, you can email either me or Ryan (at <br/>
his pocketmail address) off list. <br/>

<br/>
I am planning a section hike just south of Waynesboro same time.  I <br/>
have planned to come into town about noon on Wed the 11th, get a VA <br/>
drivers license, and was looking to find a lift 50 miles down SkyLine <br/>
Drive to where it crosses the AT 60 trail miles south of Rockfish <br/>
Gap.  Then hiking back to the gap from Wed afternoon to Sunday <br/>
morning.  <br/>
<br/>
Ryan is averaging a little more than I should be trying...  22 miles <br/>
in a day got me in knee trouble last month.  I am contemplating 15 <br/>
miles a day this time and taking glucosamine. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can find a time to meet and say hi.  I would love to <br/>
exchange stamps and meet Ryan the GreenTurtle (and Amanda from <br/>
Seattle).  I am about to start finding a shuttle from Waynesboro to <br/>
the spot I mentioned.  Are you going to be in town by Wed so I could <br/>
tempt you with the shuttle fee?  If so, please write me at <br/>
geoflyfisherATyahooDOTcom.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, if there is any interest, my trail notes and pictures from May <br/>
(including the note that I found Amanda's Magic Rabbit) are posted <br/>
here:<br/>
