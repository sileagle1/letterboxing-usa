&gt;snip&lt; But really, all this incessant bickering... How does it look to<br/>
&gt; someone who just discovered letterboxing, wants to get involved and<br/>
&gt; comes here because the group is listed on numerous sites... and<br/>
&gt; finds... this infighting? I find it rather interesting that the people<br/>
&gt; who voice the negative opinions are the loudest ones of all.&gt;snip&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Well now, maybe you are on to something. Just like the kids who fight<br/>
to keep their parents hopping, maybe the nastiness on the list is<br/>
about keeping letterboxing small the way it used to be. As in, if we<br/>
act really nasty maybe nobody will want to play with us and will leave<br/>
us alone.......<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>
