                    <div class="plaintext-content">We checked in to the Grumpy box at mansfield Hollow yesterday to do a <br/>
quick box replacement thanks to Valerie for word that the lid had <br/>
cracked. We replaced the cheap gladware with the good rubbermade box <br/>
and Grumpy will  be happier this winter. Glad to see that there were <br/>
40 stamps in his book.  It was cold and the lake frozen . 3 crazy ice <br/>
fisherman braved the new ice to set up out in the middle.  <br/>
   Happy New Year to all, My resolution to walk everyday and box more <br/>
should see my count rise. It would be good to plant the box full of <br/>
letterboxes I drive around with everyday. Wish I could have gone to <br/>
Hartman sounds fun!  See you all on the trails...Leader of the Pack &amp; <br/>
