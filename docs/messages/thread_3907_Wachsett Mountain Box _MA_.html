                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today there was 8 inches of snow here, so birkie_bob and I <br/>
skiied up Wachusett Mountain to check the box there.  He dug <br/>
the box out , removed the soggy mildewed log book, and towel <br/>
dried the box and stamp. We placed a new logbook and the<br/>
dried stamp into a fresh plastic bag, and placed it back in the<br/>
tupperware box. The box was replaced with a rock underneath<br/>
it as well as below so water will hopefully drain away from it.  <br/>
Water coming down the hillside goes into the crevice where it <br/>
is placed, and there is only just one slab of stone over it. It<br/>
might be better off placed under one of the nearby large <br/>
boulders, where the water can't run directly onto it.  Just a <br/>
suggestion to avoid future problems. <br/>
<br/>
I hope the owner doesn't mind that we cleaned it up.  I will <br/>
return the damaged contents via snail mail to the box owner. <br/>
Please contact me by email. <br/>

PS.Thank you for all the great suggestions for wording of<br/>
cards to be placed into boxes. I am now at work on putting<br/>
some new boxes together to be placed when the snow is<br/>
gone (which could be next weekend --or next April!).  <br/>
