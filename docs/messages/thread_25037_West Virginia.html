<br/>
Hitting the road in the Ford Taurus to a balmy 54, I was expecting a pleasant trip to West Virginia. Within hours the temperature dipped down to 27 and a winter storm warning was issued.  <br/>
<br/>
Driving slow and steady, I made it to Berkeley Springs State Park safe and sound. Berkeley Springs is known for its restorative powers and this Investigator needed restoring. Although it has been a good journey, the memory of the last couple of cases was still unnerving. The warm spring waters and a soothing massage was the ticket for relaxation. <br/>
<br/>
A couple of days of this and my body was as relaxed as it was going to get. Now, on to a culinary delight. The HillBilly Hot Dogs was just down the road a bit in Lesage. Not only does the food excel, the dcor is downright homey. I pulled into the parking lot with anticipation of a fine meal when this car comes out of nowhere. Just missing me by inches, it zipped into my parking space and came to a screeching halt. Flipping open my cell phone, I ran the North Carolina plates and discovered they belonged to one Knit Wit. Spending a few moments contemplating a well-deserved retribution, I decided to keep cool and find another parking space. After all, my stomach was becoming vocal. Ordering the "home wrecker," I finished it in under 12 minutes, earning my right to wear the free t-shirt. <br/>
<br/>
This year's "ACUI Table Tennis Championship Tournament" was in Morgantown. As a former Table Tennis Champion, ping-pong if you prefer, I was invited to umpire the women's games. Those dames swing a mean paddle. The winner, from Shepherd University, won the chance to play in the International Tournament.<br/>
<br/>
Soupy Sales grew up in Huntington. Not information of any importance, just an interesting little tidbit. Marshall Artists Series hosts The Spring International Film Festival here. I had two days in which to cram six movies. Showing were films from Ireland, France, Haiti, Canada, Russia and Mexico. "Ghosts of Cite Soleil," the Haitian film, was outstanding. If you get a chance, do go see it. But, I did not come here to talk about spas, parking spaces, table tennis or Soupy; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
West Virginia needs letterboxes! Only around 170 in the state and over half of them are drivebys. Only 10 mysteries, count them, 10! Does anyone actually live in West Virginia? What the state lacks in numbers, they gain in enthusiasm. Be careful about where you plant; the NPS loves to confiscate. When hiking in West Virginia, all states for that matter, inform someone of your route. Goes along with being prepared. Watch for noxious vegetation; poison ivy (the plant, not the person) will itch. Consider letterboxing in West Virginia, it is worth the trip. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
<br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>
