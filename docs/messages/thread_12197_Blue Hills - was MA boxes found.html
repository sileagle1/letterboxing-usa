ambitious. We found Fiendish Things  and Back to the Lab and were <br/>
very impressed by the carving. Loved the local of Fiendish Things as <br/>
well. We also did a check on our Blue Hills Birthday box and enjoyed <br/>
reading the entries.<br/>
<br/>
We also located the Billings Barn box and the Fertile Frond at Moose <br/>
Hill; both in fine shape. <br/>
<br/>
Lovely walks all.<br/>

&gt; A Tree For All Seasons: Spring at Chase Woodlands in Dover is in <br/>
&gt; place, dry, and intact.  While the log is by no means empty, we're <br/>
&gt; surprised more people haven't hunted up this sequential series.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We bit off a little more than we could chew with TeamGreenDragon's <br/>
&gt; Time Travels series in Milton's Blue Hill Reservation, but we feel <br/>
&gt; four out of the six is a respectable haul.  The hand-carved stamps <br/>
&gt; are awesome, and if Brian doesn't submit some of his work for the <br/>
&gt; Smithsonian collection, we'll... well, we'll pout!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We got Weena, Time Traveler's Return, Into The Future, and Back To <br/>
&gt; The Lab, in that order.  All were in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We also set the Happy Trails Hitchhiker free... somewhere.<br/>
