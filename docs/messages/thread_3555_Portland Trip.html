<div>Hi all</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have visited the site and am particularly 
interested in the following boxes.</div>
<div>Tryon Creek State Park</div>
<div>Portland Community College</div>
<div>Tualatin Hills Nature Park and Rick's 
Farm</div>
<div>Rock Creek Neighborhood</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I still have time I also would like to 
capture</div>
<div>Pooch Place</div>
<div>Hyland Forest</div>
<div>Fanno Creek Greenway</div>
<div>The Lost Letterbox</div>
<div>Who Let The Dogs Out</div>
<div>Japanese Garden</div>
<div>Mt Tabor</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am also interested in placing two of my Wolf 
Mystery Letterboxes. I have located a promising site in Washington, but my 
search in Oregon has not produced any leads as of yet [any assistance would be 
appreciated].</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another of my big goals is to meet and exchange 
stamps.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was in the Portland area about 4 years age. At 
that time I did hike in the Gorge area and also climbed Mt St Helen (before 
anyone put a box up there).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I plan to concentrate on getting the most boxes I 
can to see if I can get close to that 300 number.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>hope to see you all.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just hit the F100 mark this past weekend and out of that, 34 of <br/>
those are Portland area boxes.  Cedar Hills Twins is also close to <br/>
some of the boxes that you already have on your list.  Also, if you <br/>
can figure it out, The Spirit of Dartmoor is very convenient.  I also <br/>
love Mt. Tabor, it is one of my favorites. <br/>
