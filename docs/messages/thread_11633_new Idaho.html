Nearest town: Athol, Idaho<br/>
County: Kootenai<br/>
<br/>
Find this spot in Idaho history:<br/>
It was wartime and following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States<br/>
government was in need of a safe inland Naval Training Station. This spot<br/>
fulfilled all the criteria with one of the deepest lakes in the county,<br/>
available acreage, and remote enough for safety concerns but near enough a<br/>
railroad to get supplies and recruits to the station.<br/>
<br/>
Today this spot is an Idaho State Park. Use any state highway map to locate<br/>
the park and proceed there.<br/>
As you travel on highway 54, or also called Smylie Blvd.,  go 1.5 miles from<br/>
the toll booth. Here you will turn right finding that barred place for Navy<br/>
law breakers. Park here and if it is summer it will be open for you to<br/>
explore. <br/>
When you are ready to look for the letterbox walk around the right  side of<br/>
the brig. Stop at the old low horizontal wall.  Standing so that you are<br/>
facing directly behind the wall, walk from the right corner of this wall  30<br/>
paces in the direction of  between 1 and 2 (clock face).<br/>
You will find an old cement foundation about 3 x  3. Remember old<br/>
foundations can have secret crevices!!<br/>
