<br/>
Taking full advantage of the cold but otherwise snow-less winter weather here <br/>
in CT, Sugarmaker and I (part of the Collinsville (CT) Crew) headed out to <br/>
East Hampton this past Saturday, where we trekked through part of the Salmon <br/>
River State Forest and snagged the Comstock Covered Bridge letterbox and the <br/>
Verdi letterbox. However, the Drewclan's Salmon River Troutbox proved to be <br/>
the most elusive catch of the day. We believe we were in the correct location <br/>
and spent a good 20 minutes fishing around the area for it but, alas, we <br/>
never even got a bite. Has anyone found this box recently, or has it gone <br/>
missing (perhaps to warmer waters)?<br/>
<br/>
