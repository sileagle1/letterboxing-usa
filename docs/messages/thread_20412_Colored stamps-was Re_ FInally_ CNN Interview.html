Yes, I use Crayola markers. You can color directly onto the stamp so<br/>
that you get very precise lines. Also, by huffing onto the stamp, you<br/>
re-moisturize the stamp ink and then it all transfers with the same<br/>
freshness. AND after you stamp into your logbook, you huff on the<br/>
stamp again and then stamp it a couple of times on a paper towel and<br/>
it cleans the stamp off. Easy!<br/>
<br/>
The cat's eye ink pads are very popular with a lot of folks too, and<br/>
I've heard good things about them. I just don't like to use ink<br/>
anymore and find that the markers give me better control over coloring<br/>
than a horizontal ink pad. <br/>
<br/>
I buy two packs of varying color markers and carrying them all in a<br/>
zippered case. I look at the stamp and choose my colors based on the<br/>
design. I also use the markers to swap around how my sig stamp looks<br/>
in various logbooks so that if others see my stamp around a lot, at<br/>
least they get to see it in different colors.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the compliments,<br/>

So far I have been lucky and found them on clearance, but purchasing the ink pad's can get expensive. I have thought of just placing BYOInk on my box's clues. Is this OK?<br/>

<br/>
The vast majority of letterboxes do not have ink pads.  It does seem <br/>
to be more common out east, but it's VERY rare to find ink pads in a <br/>
letterbox out west.  And even those that have ink pads--it's still a <br/>
good idea for a letterboxer to carry their own supply since the one <br/>
in the box might be frozen (in the depths of winter) or waterlogged <br/>
or any other number of problems.  Or maybe the ink just plain ran <br/>
out.  Letterboxers should always carry ink pads with them, and <br/>
letterboxes never need to have them at all.  =)<br/>
