should get out to do this series.  We had lots of fun and finished <br/>
today.  We went totally out of order, finishing with 5 golden rings <br/>
today- what an ingenious hidey place!! :0)  Thanks, too to Leader of <br/>
the Pack for recarving the gazebo roof, now if I can ever get back to <br/>
Killingly, I'll be able to finish it!!!  We think we finished <br/>
Harkness today, also.  "Boo" was with us and he gets such a kick out <br/>
of helping Nana stamp in-- For those of you with stroller <br/>
limitations, Harkness, Stenger Park, and the Waterford Green boxes <br/>
are all "do-able".  Although, Swamp Yankee bought a 3 wheel jogger <br/>
stroller so we can box M-F when I have the grandson.  Some strollers <br/>
might be more of a challenge.  Happy Boxing!!!-Sunshine<br/>
