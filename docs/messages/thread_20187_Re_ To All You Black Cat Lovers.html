have two 14 year old cats that I am fostering and it would be tough<br/>
on them. The kittens stayed with me for three days, and then a foster<br/>
mom from the Paw'd Squad who is great with kittens took them home<br/>
yesterday. She will take care of them until they are old enough to be<br/>
adopted, and then the Squad will find good homes for them. :) -Q<br/>
