DAISIES IN THE WOOD</div>
<div>                                            
Tolland, CT, Tolland County</div>
<div>                               
Placed on June 30, 2001 by Churchill and the Pinecone</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Over the shoulders and slopes of the dune</div>
<div>I saw the white daisies go down to the sea,</div>
<div>A host in the sunshine, an army in June,</div>
<div>The people God sends us to set our hearts free.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The bobolinks rallied them up from the dell,</div>
<div>the orioles whistled them out of the wood;</div>
<div>And all of their saying was, "Earth it is well!"</div>
<div>And all of their dancing was, "Life, thou art 
good!"</div>

<div>Easy In-and-out, 45 minutes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Interstate 84 to exit 67. Go North on route 31. At light go 
North (right) onto route 30. At next traffic light turn left onto continuation 
of route 30.  At light go West (left) onto route 140.  Go about 3 
miles, turn right onto Hopkins (dirt) Road. Park on right side just before 
road starts. You will see an oval shaped, blue "Shenipsit Trail" sign on a 
tree.  Walk back in the direction which you drove in from, Northeasterly 
along route 140. Stay on the "woods" side of the guard rails. You must walk 
about 100 yards along the road to get to the trailhead.  You will see 
a blue trail marker sign on the South side of the road.  Enter the 
woods here. Go about 100 feet in and see the blue trail marker leading 
you into the woods at 100degrees.   This is a clearly marked 
blue state trail. This section is new, being blazed in 2000.  Follow 
the markers, and twist and turn along the trail. You will see the blue marker 
indicating a left turn.  Go left. You are now on an old woods road.  
In 50 feet, the markers indicate a right turn, DONT GO!, The daisies are 
calling...they want OUT of the wood!  Follow the wider path at 30degrees. 
Go 16 paces.  At 120degrees there is a knee-high stone.</div>
<div>Please cover me back up so that I am not visible once the 
foliage has fallen. Retrace your steps back to your car.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you would like a longer walk..walk down Hopkins road, and 
enter the Blue trail on the right side of the road. It is a five mile walk (one 
way) to Soapstone Mountain.</div>
