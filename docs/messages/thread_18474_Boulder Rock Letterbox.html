	Too bad the weather turned on you -typical Catskill mountain conditions.<br/>
	This is the second LB at this site. The first one was put directly under<br/>
"Boulder Rock" but somebody took  it a short time after it was placed. I<br/>
know that the spot were we put this box was not a good hiding place but<br/>
it's tough to find a good hiding spot around there.<br/>
	It's amazing that anyone that didn't have a clue to where it was could<br/>
find the lb as it was buried under lot of leaves. Maybe the wind blew<br/>
them away, it gets very windy up at that elevation.<br/>
	A much easier lb to find is the one on top of Overlook mountain. ( The<br/>
"Overlook Hotel" letterbox )  You get to drive up to the top of the<br/>
mountain. ( I recommend approaching it from the north side - McDainels<br/>
Road - on the Bearsville side )             Our second most difficult one<br/>
to find is the one on top of Wittenberg - with the "best" views of any<br/>
mountain around. The box is below the ledge on the left side about 10<br/>
feet down with a slanted rock holding it down against the ledge. This<br/>
hike is strenous. Start at the Woodland Park Campsite , right at the<br/>
beginning, there is a wooden bridge that begins the ascent!  <br/>
	Jill and I were thinking that  we need to find easier places to put<br/>
letterboxes. Our "Hidden Pond" one will probably never be found by anyone<br/>
as well as the one on "Top of Slide" . It's my fault for not picking good<br/>
spots to hide.<br/>
<br/>
	We will have to replace and relocate this ' Boulder Rock " one at a<br/>
later date.<br/>
