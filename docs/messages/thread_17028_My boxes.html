If you were the only one who didn't report I wouldn't have bothered <br/>
commenting.<br/>

I had thought this hobby would be a fun way to meet new people. Now I <br/>
think my daughter is right -- there are other things I should be <br/>
doing with my time.<br/>

&gt; We may have been neglectful in reporting our finds to you, but not <br/>
out<br/>
&gt; of disrespect, just an oversight. We do enjoy finding<br/>
&gt; your letterboxes and your stamps, which we have discussed<br/>
&gt; with you in person. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The issue that we have objected to in our previous post is that<br/>
&gt; information and more importantly (mis-information)is being <br/>
carelessly<br/>
&gt; published about boxes that the creators would like to maintain a <br/>
&gt; modicum of mystique. <br/>
