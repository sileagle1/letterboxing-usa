                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK this is just in! There is rumored to be a floundering newbie Republic named Letrabox (after our noble pursuit) somewhere in Central America where a despot ruler forces his subjects to not only attend unnecessary LB classes at the outrageous price of $5, but also mandates that they submit their HH logs, and all those they have found regardless of the hider's wishes, to EVERYONE's stamps at gatherings! Disgusting! The state-run media actually broadcasts clues with complete disregard toward expanding the pool of seekers and popularity of this activity! Here is the link... www.lbcountry.gov/constitution/obligations<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone agrees it is essential we organize a mercenary liberation force to free these citizens from their forced defacing of logs and submission to paid LB education! It is unreasonable to assume they may be enjoying these activities. What's next.. that they evolve their own pasttimes based on our corrupted principles? What is letterboxing coming to? Where is the respect for traditional LB values?<br/>
