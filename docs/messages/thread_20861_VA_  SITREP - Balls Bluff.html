sunny-partly cloudy, peak leaves...  My kids and I joined some other <br/>
folks on a family hike in Balls Bluff.  We went the reverse way around <br/>
the loop from the clues, so I missed #3, but I found #s 2 and then 1 <br/>
with no trouble.  Well hidden; re-hid them even better.  Box outsides <br/>
were dirty but insides were dry &amp; basically clean.  Very nice stamps.  <br/>
Books were overfull, though - visitors had left extra pages.  Please add <br/>
more books!  The others had gone on ahead, so nobody but my 2-1/2 year <br/>
old saw their locations AFAIK.  She screamed a lot because she wanted to <br/>
stamp everything, including her arms and the outside of my book.<br/>
<br/>
Figured out in hindsight - once we passed #2 - where #3 was, but didn't <br/>
have time that day to go back to it, alas.  Had to rush off for a ballet <br/>
class.  Will go back some other time to finish the series.<br/>
<br/>
Lovely location for a short walk with the kids!  Thanks :-&gt; <br/>
