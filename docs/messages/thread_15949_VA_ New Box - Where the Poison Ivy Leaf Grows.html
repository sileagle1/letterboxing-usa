Placed by: Poison Ivy<br/>
Placement date: Sep 13 2003<br/>
State: Virginia<br/>
County: Fairfax<br/>
Nearest city: Vienna<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
<br/>
With a courteous hat tip to Daughter of the Old Dominion.<br/>
<br/>
The original box named Rusty was placed in this park - a temporary box<br/>
placed in memory of a pet that had passed on. I and friends went in<br/>
search of Rusty and were certain we'd found the spot, but not the box.<br/>
I had a box ready in the car so I decided to place it here in memory<br/>
of the box in memory of Rusty. (The stamp is a poison ivy leaf, a red<br/>
fern would have been more appropriate - remember Ol' Yeller?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, we were looking in the wrong spot. So Rusty may still be<br/>
there, and now so is this one in a similar spot. The directions are<br/>
the same as "Rusty" with only one word changed.....from left to right.<br/>
If you find the "Poison Ivy" go back to the directions and change<br/>
'right' to 'left' and go on to find "Rusty."<br/>
<br/>
"Directions to Park: From I-66, take Nutley Street toward Vienna. Turn<br/>
left at light on Courthouse Road. Turn left into the first parking<br/>
lot. If you reach Nottoway Park, you?ve gone too far.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Box: Take the main path past the enclosed dog area on<br/>
your left. At the fork, take the left path. You will reach a sewer<br/>
cover on the right of the path. Stand on the word sewer, with your<br/>
toes toward Fairfax. Look off into the woods at about the 11 o?clock<br/>
position. You will see two V trees. Make your own path to the trees<br/>
and stand between them. Ahead of you is a boxwood. The box is under<br/>
the north edge of the bush."<br/>
