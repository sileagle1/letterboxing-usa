<br/>
Difficulty: moderate/easy, some steep hills and bush whacking/short <br/>
hikes.  Time: Allow about 30 minutes round trip hiking time per <br/>
letterbox, most will be less.  Boating time will vary depending on <br/>
mode of transportation.<br/>
Selden Island is an island on the Ct River in Lyme across from the <br/>
Deep River docks and therefore accessible by water only, although <br/>
some maps and the DEP refer to it as Selden Neck.  The north end of <br/>
the neck was breached during a severe freshet in 1854 making it and <br/>
island.  <br/>
The following isn't to discourage anyone from trying to find our <br/>
letterboxes.  We only want searchers to be informed and have fun <br/>
finding them.  We spend a lot of time on the CT River and enjoy it <br/>
immensely.  We want our boxes to be found and the finders to have a <br/>
safe and enjoyable time.  Therefore, here are some things to consider <br/>
prior to hitting the water:<br/>
The CT River has a lot of boat traffic on the weekends during the <br/>
warm summer months, not as much during the week.  Don't expect <br/>
everyone to slow down.  Most boaters will extend a little common <br/>
courtesy but there are some who will not.  Be wary of wakes also.  A <br/>
small boat pulled up on shore can get swamped and a larger one can <br/>
get stranded when hit by a wake cresting on shore, you may consider <br/>
leaving someone behind to tend to the boat.  Early mornings in the <br/>
summer, excluding weekends, are superb. The river is like glass and <br/>
the traffic is minimal.<br/>
The coast guard requires all vessels to have a Personal Floatation <br/>
Device (PFD) on board for each passenger.  The State of Ct requires <br/>
all persons in canoes and kayaks to wear their PFD between Oct 1 and <br/>
May 30.<br/>
For motor boats and sail boats, the entrance to Selden Creek at the <br/>
north end of the island gets very shallow at low tide, down to a foot <br/>
or less. <br/>
If you're rowing or paddling you may want to consult a tide chart <br/>
before heading out.  It could make the journey quicker and easier.  <br/>
Two boat launches are fairly close to the island. The carry in launch <br/>
at the Hadlyme side of the Chester ferry, Rt. 148, and at the Deep <br/>
river docks, although the last time I was at the Deep River docks the <br/>
launch was labeled for Deep River residents only.  The river is also <br/>
accessible at the launch in East Haddam at the mouth of the Salmon <br/>
River and in Old Saybrook under the I-95 Bridge.  <br/>
Campsites can be reserved for one night stays by contacting <br/>
Gillette's Castle. They are all well labeled. The boxes are<br/>
located <br/>
to allow letterboxers to find them without disturbing campers.  <br/>
<br/>
The Cedars<br/>
<br/>
The most northern campsite and the only one not directly on the Ct <br/>
River is The Cedars.  Enter Selden Creek at the northern tip of the <br/>
island.  The campsite is a short way in on the right.  From the <br/>
campsite take the trail that follows the creek to the west heading <br/>
back toward the river.  When you get to the small clearing on the <br/>
north end of the island, head south to the base of the hill, a downed <br/>
tree to your left will show you the best route.  Follow the contour <br/>
of the marsh a short way to the left to find a stonewall.  Follow the <br/>
trail with the stonewall to your left until you come to a spot were <br/>
the wall projects about 5 feet into the trail. You'll know<br/>
you're at <br/>
the right spot if you look to your right up the hill, perpendicular <br/>
to the path, to see several pieces of pipe in a row sticking up out <br/>
of the ledge, an old farmers way of setting his barbed wire fence in <br/>
a place he couldn't dig holes for his posts.  On the south side<br/>
of <br/>
the piece of wall that sticks into the trail look for the Cedars <br/>
letterbox at ground level.  If for some reason you can't start at<br/>
the <br/>
Cedars campsite, just south of the ledge at the north end of the <br/>
island on the river side is a wonderful beach.  You can pull in <br/>
there, hike up the hill to the southeast, walk a couple hundred yards <br/>
and then turn east and find the stonewall at the base of the hill.<br/>
<br/>
Hog Back<br/>
<br/>
	The next campsite heading south is Hog Back and it's also the <br/>
most northerly one on the river side of the island.  You can pull in <br/>
either north or south of the campsite.  If you go south make sure you <br/>
make a wide turn to avoid the ledge just under the surface about 20 <br/>
yards in front of the camp site, the letterbox is planted to the <br/>
north.  From the campsite follow the path a short way along the <br/>
water's edge, to a large beech tree with the names of past<br/>
campers <br/>
carved into the bark.  From this tree walk northeast past two large <br/>
boulders, across the low hill, through a hemlock graveyard, to the <br/>
first ledge outcrop at the base of the hill.  If you look closely on <br/>
the top of the left side you can make out some quarry marks left from <br/>
centuries ago.  Look up the steep hill to the southeast to see a <br/>
double trunked tree in the shape of a V.  Climb the hill and from the <br/>
tree look north.  The box is hidden at the base of the ledge just to <br/>
the right of the big oak tree about 30 steps away.<br/>
<br/>
Spring Ledge<br/>
<br/>
	The middle campsite on the river is Spring Ledge just past <br/>
the navigational aid.  This is our favorite picnic spot during the <br/>
spring and fall when the traffic on the river lightens up mainly <br/>
because the large cliff to the north does a great job blocking the <br/>
wind and the sun shines in across the water and keeps it nice and <br/>
warm.  If you want to hear a boring but unbelievable story about <br/>
something that was lost and found here let us know.  Your search <br/>
starts at the extreme southern end of the beach, past the loose <br/>
stones and the two ledge out crops.  At all but high water notice the <br/>
two large slabs of granite left by the quarries after the invention <br/>
of cement.  Climb the ridge to the top and find the remains of a <br/>
shack and many old bedsprings. Be careful of old nails in the boards <br/>
here and there.  Standing at the western side of the bed springs the <br/>
letterbox is hidden in the rocks at the top of the western end of the <br/>
ridge across the little valley to the immediate north.<br/>
<br/>
Quarry Knob<br/>
<br/>
	The most southerly campsite is Quarry Knob.  The letterbox is <br/>
planted on the ridge between the campsite and Cold Spring, which is <br/>
around the point to the north.  From the lower picnic area at the <br/>
campsite follow the trail around the hill to the north and up to the <br/>
rocky cliffs.  From the left of the cliffs, climb up to the top of <br/>
the ridge.  Look for a "horseshoe" sticking out of a large<br/>
rock.  <br/>
Beside the horseshoe shaped anchor point find the survey marker<br/>
"Neck <br/>
No.2".  Continue northeast over the top of the ridge to find two <br/>
stonewalls. Just past a VERY large fallen dead tree, the letterbox is <br/>
hidden near the top of the place where the two walls meet.<br/>
	If you want to continue around the island, you are about half <br/>
way to the southern tip.  Once in the creek you must slow down, as <br/>
the entire creek is a "No Wake" zone, and is ideal for canoes<br/>
or <br/>
kayaks.  Beware of the swans in the late spring and summer. There is <br/>
one that can be aggressive when the hen is on the nest or little ones <br/>
are around.  If you are in a small boat or canoe/kayak there are a <br/>
couple side streams to explore.  In the fall the colors are <br/>
spectacular.<br/>
<br/>
As always, remember to leave the boxes as well hidden (or better) <br/>
then you found them.  Our email address is on all of them if supplies <br/>
or repairs are needed.  Good luck and enjoy.<br/>
