Hi to all in LB land, <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone can help me out..... It's about hitchhiker log booklets that<br/>
are separated from a stamp that belongs to it.... a "Miller Highlife" stamp<br/>
....... It was sent out a few months back so who know's where they are?<br/>
<br/>
So now the idea was given to me by Motogal to find the carver of the stamp<br/>
that went to the "Miller Highlife" hitchhiker logbooklets that were sent<br/>
without the associated stamp. All I know is that the stamper that asked to<br/>
"pass it on" stamped in with a "KB" winged shaped bird and wrote K-BAN, with<br/>
friends Ginger, Jhub, TyTy, and what looks like "Nicves" to the best of my<br/>
ability because it is blurred out because the book got wet and the ink<br/>
smeared. There is no "Miller Highlfe" hitchhiker listed or a member in the<br/>
LB group called "K-BAN".........That is why I say 'posing' ....... Where do<br/>
I go from here? ......... <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for that bit of info, yes there are stamps from the Wisconsin area , not sure what the dates were. I think they were only a year or two back but I am not sure.  Will check into the "beers" connection.   If I can  not  find out who this belongs to, I will send a booklet with a copy of the stamp that was made by the 'hitchhikers owner' that is in our log book out to ....................
