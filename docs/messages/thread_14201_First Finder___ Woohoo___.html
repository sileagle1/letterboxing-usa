  Nice, cooler day here today.<br/>
  Returned to Blue Hills and the site of E=MC2 and this time located <br/>
  the box - yay!  Another amazing Green Dragon stamp, worth the second <br/>
  trip.<br/>
<br/>
  Then I crossed over the highway and placed the Sylvan Scholar box at <br/>
  the Eleanor Cabot Bradley Estate in Canton. This estate has lovely <br/>
  gardens as well as trail through the woods. If you are going to the <br/>
  Blue Hills, this would be an easy stop to add. This is my first stamp <br/>
  that is both completely hand drawn and hand carved. (Not as cavy <br/>
  lovers first - my kids' stamps are 100% original).<br/>
<br/>
  Have a good week!<br/>
  Kim, Cavy Lovers<br/>
