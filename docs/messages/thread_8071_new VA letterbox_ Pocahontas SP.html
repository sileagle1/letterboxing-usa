Location: Pocahontas State Park, VA<br/>
County: Chesterfield<br/>
Nearest town: Richmond, VA<br/>
Date Placed: Sept. 29, 2002<br/>

Easy, short hunt<br/>
<br/>
This box was placed while attending the East Coast Meet/Greet. <br/>
Andrew Welker (Biki) and I each decided to carve a stamp while at the <br/>
M/G. He carved and hid his elsewhere in the park, so be on the <br/>
lookout.<br/>
<br/>
Upon entering the park, follow the road to the main parking lot.<br/>
You will see a sign directing you to shelters 1-3, follow that road to <br/>
the end and park.<br/>
<br/>
1. From the boat ramp head to the bridge, on the South side.<br/>
<br/>
2. Once at the south side of the bridge, head NorthWest along the <br/>
creek, going towards the woodline.<br/>
<br/>
3. Where the grass turns to trees you will see a wooden bench. Sit <br/>
down, enjoy the view of the creek.<br/>
<br/>
4. Head towards the top of the hill and find the ridgeline.<br/>
<br/>
5. Follow the trail along the ridgeline heading SouthWest, all the <br/>
while paralleling the creek.<br/>
<br/>
6. As you walk along the ridge you will come upon a large shelter <br/>
(Shelter #3).<br/>
<br/>
7. Before you reach the shelter look for a large tree on the creek <br/>
bank with exposed roots.<br/>
<br/>
8. BE CAREFUL NOT TO SLIDE INTO THE CREEK &amp; WATCH OUT FOR CRITTERS.<br/>
<br/>
9. As you peer under the roots, you will soon find your fruits.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE ensure that you poke a stick around under the roots first, to <br/>
ensure there are no little unpleasantries waiting for you.<br/>
<br/>
If the box is damaged or missing please notify me ASAP.<br/>
