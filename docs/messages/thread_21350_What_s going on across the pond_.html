Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Revisiting letterbox history and looking at current methods and <br/>
activities such as virtual, personal stamps, urban, postal, postal <br/>
rings, I'm struck with a question of whether any of this is more US <br/>
or are the trends happening on both sides of the pond?  With <br/>
internet accessibility, that's likely to happen, but what are the <br/>
popular trends overseas?  Has letterboxing remained more traditional <br/>
over there?  Is there anything uniquely American?  Any thoughts are <br/>
appreciated.  Thanks! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
