It was my understanding that they count for both a find and a plant.<br/>
That's what I heard at a gathering a few months ago.<br/>

Hmm, that is interesting.  I just looked at the FAQs and didn't see a<br/>
more clear definition there - only that they count towards P and F, but<br/>
not specifically how or for who.<br/>
<br/>
I have always just counted them as a find, and thought that was the<br/>
norm.  Afterall, I only gave it a ride - didn't acutally put it<br/>
together.  To me it just makes sense that it only counts as a plant for<br/>
the original launcher.  Maybe Jay or someone will see this and shed the<br/>
"traditional" viewpoint with us.<br/>
<br/>
I actually keep track of HH as a seperate number in my log only because<br/>
I think it is cool to see how many I have found (only 1 so far).<br/>

Here is another question, if you find the same hitchhiker twice, does <br/>
it count as a second find? (my initial though would be no, you <br/>
can't "find" a box a second time once you found it.)<br/>

We share the above view.  We don't ever Find the HHs that we <br/>
Planted, and we only Find other people's HHs once even though <br/>
we may come across the same one at another location some <br/>
other time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, moving a HH seems a personal decision.  If its at your own <br/>
box or you have seen it before or don't feel in the mood, you <br/>
might just leave for the next adventurer.  On the other hand if it <br/>
has been waiting for a long time at a seldom visited location, you <br/>
might want to move it elsewhere so others can find and enjoy it.<br/>

<br/>This was my understanding as well, and is how I've counted the HHs we've found. All three of them. :-)
