series.  Looks like your favorite musicals are some of mine, too!  We <br/>
had to backtrack for a few we missed the first time.  We also found <br/>
the Bastille Day HH at the last box, left by Dan, Melissa &amp; Max.  We <br/>
met up with them when we were starting, they were finishing.  And <br/>
Climb Every Mountain was our 200th box!  How appropriate.  You might <br/>
want to check on the degree heading for Oklahoma.  A few people noted <br/>
that they also found it at 250 instead of 25.  Thank you to Melissa <br/>
for leaving us a note on the stone wall to let us know about that <br/>
heading!  Thank you to everyone for such a great day.  It was a <br/>
wonderful birthday present for Patrick.<br/>

<div>I really enjoyed my Tuesday off from school by spending the day up in 
Mansfield.  I started out early and was on the trail to 21 musicals before 
9.  That steep climb at the begining was perfect for warming me up!  
Max was a great help with this series.  I guess all of the visitors over 
the weekend left a great scent to follow because he ended up showing me where 
several of the boxes were.  He would run ahead and start sniffing a stump 
or stone wall, and sure enough when I got there, hidden inside was a box.  
He loved visiting with Amy, Patrick, and Ruth.  (Max says thank you for the 
peanut butter covered doggie biscuit)  I'm glad you guys got my note.  
I spent a while poking around before trying some other directions.</div>
<div>    I continued my day with 
several quickies in the area.  I really loved the Pink Panther series, the 
clues were great fun, and the stamps were wonderful!  I also loved the 
Totem Pole stamp.  Max and I had another surprise meeting while crossing 
the Lion's Club soccer fields.  I was checking the clues by the plaque when 
Max took off down the hill and across the field to a family who was heading 
back.  I ran down after him. apologizing for his terrorizing them when we 
both noticed the clues sheets.  I met Mike, Rachel and kids on their way 
back from finding the box!!  It was great meeting you and exchanging 
stamps.  Thank you for the surprise that you shared with me.</div>
<div>    Chuck- your air mail 
letterbox was great!  Although Max was a little freaked out when I was 
retrieving it and returning it to its hiding spot.  Like that hand carved 
stamp too.</div>
<div>    Thanks to all of you 
who have hidden boxes in Mansfield.  I really enjoyed spending the day 
there.  I'll be back soon, as my pile of clues for that town is still huge 
:)</div>

<div>Happy Thanksgiving Everybody!  </div>
