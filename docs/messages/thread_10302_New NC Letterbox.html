Nantahala Village Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
County: Swain County, NC<br/>
Closest city: Bryson, City, NC<br/>
Placed by: Joe and one of the Buds<br/>
<br/>
The Nantahala Village Lodge is the starting point for this letterbox<br/>
hidden on a loop trail near Fontana Lake. Located 15 minutes west of<br/>
Bryson City, NC on US Route 19, the trails which begin here are fairly<br/>
easy wooded walks with some great views on Village property and land of<br/>
the US Forest Service. There is an excellent picnic and swimming spot at<br/>
lakeside very near the letterbox, so you might want to pack a swimsuit<br/>
and call the lodge at 828-488-2826 and have them pack a box lunch for<br/>
your walk. They have an excellent restaurant if you dont want to pack<br/>
in your lunch. This lodge was built a year after the fire in 1997 that<br/>
destroyed the original lodge of 1949. The letterbox contains a<br/>
beautifully carved stamp that you will be proud to have.<br/>
<br/>
Equipment needed: good hiking shoes/boots, a compass (just in case).<br/>
<br/>
Time: about an hour and 15 minutes to an hour and a half.<br/>
<br/>
Type of steps: those of a 6 man.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty of walk: moderate with some uphill walking. The entire route<br/>
is on either a small paved road, dirt path, or a gravel road.<br/>
<br/>
Caution: Parts of the rail can be muddy following a rain. Horses and<br/>
bicyclists share this trail.<br/>
<br/>
Extra information: A free trail map is available at the lodge, but trust<br/>
the directions in the clues. Lodge rooms or cabins are available for<br/>
rent: www.nvnc.com. We thank the Nantahala Village for allowing<br/>
letterboxers permission to park on their property. They are not<br/>
responsible for this letterbox or for your mishaps.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
1.	From the west end of the lodge, walk downhill on the small paved<br/>
road called Blue Ridge Parkway.<br/>
2.	This road twists around several cabins. Pass the Tabor House, an<br/>
old white farmhouse still in use. Take the unpaved clay trail to the<br/>
left of the next cabin on what is called the Hill Bypass Trail (not<br/>
signed when we were there). <br/>
3.	The trail splits after a short uphill climb. Bear left as this<br/>
is the Connector Trail which leads to the Lakeside Trail. (Note that<br/>
none of these trails are signed.)<br/>
4.	At the next intersection, take a left and you are on the<br/>
Lakeside Trail. You will soon see Fontana Lake and a mountain view<br/>
through a clearing on the trees. The train from Bryson City can<br/>
sometimes be seen or heard on its lakeside tracks, across the lake from<br/>
you. Look for the next intersection and go up, not down.<br/>
5.	As you walk, a gravel road in the distance can be seen through<br/>
the trees. Stay on your trail and turn right. Notice the large vines all<br/>
around. Soon a trail comes in from the right, but you continue straight.<br/>
6.	Look for a large forked tree beside the left side of the trail.<br/>
About 8 yards beyond it. A white PVC pipe emerges on the left at trails<br/>
edge. From this pipe you will take a certain number of steps. To get the<br/>
number, subtract the number of the year that the original lodge opened<br/>
from the date the current lodge opened (a year after the fire). Now,<br/>
subtract from this the number of clues of this letterbox. The result is<br/>
the number of steps to take from the white pipe forward along the trail.<br/>
7.	Stop. Look to the left at the large vine-wrapped tree. Look on<br/>
your right beside the trail at a cluster of rocks, knee-high. Lean in<br/>
and remove the top, odd-shaped rock that sits with 2 others that are<br/>
basically flat. All are under a small rock ledge that may be obscured by<br/>
leaves. No climbing required. Remember, its directly across from the<br/>
large tree. You are there! Stamp in and replace the rock and a few<br/>
leaves. If you continue just a few feet down the trail, youll find a<br/>
perfect private spot for that picnic or swim.<br/>
To return to the parking area: Turn back along the trail the way you<br/>
came, but keep heading straight, not left. Youll see the gravel road<br/>
and green meadow to the right. Your trail ends at the gravel road, but<br/>
youre not out yet. Turn left on the gravel road and continue up. Ignore<br/>
the short trail to a concrete block structure. There will be a Y in<br/>
the road, but still stay left. When the road turns to the right, bear<br/>
left on the older road. This will be your road/trail back to the Village<br/>
through Rhododendrons and ferns. Take the trail upward to the right. At<br/>
the brown cabin, walk along the water here and soon youll see where you<br/>
need to be. Congratulations! <br/>
