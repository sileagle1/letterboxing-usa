<br/>
While attempting to get box #2 of Ground Zero in Waterford CT this <br/>
afternoon..... I almost slipped off a cliff! Luckily there was about <br/>
a 2 1/2 foot lip that I was able to land on; thus preventing a 25' <br/>
drop to forest floor! Once I made sure I was ok and got my heart back <br/>
in my chest, I kind of sat there for a minute peering over the edge. <br/>
Got a nice abrasion on the leg, nothing purple heart related though <br/>
as it is "merely a flesh wound". LOL<br/>
<br/>
Also - brought Heidi's walking stick with me today for the first <br/>
time. Its going EVERY time now.... flipped over a piece of driftwood <br/>
and there was a rather large slithery type character staring back at <br/>
me. What a day...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to adventure... <br/>
