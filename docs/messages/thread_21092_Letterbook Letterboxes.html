Hi to all in Letterbox Land,<br/>
<br/>
It's time to try something new but I need some help in going about this task. I want to plant a letterbook in one of the local libraries but don't know how I should go about doing it.<br/>
Looks to me that there are two options:<br/>
     1)Show the article and ask for permission to place it<br/>
or<br/>
     2)Sneak it in on a top or bottom shelf<br/>
<br/>
How many of you think it should be done the first way and how many think it should be done the second way?<br/>
<br/>
Since the weather is  quickly going downhill here in Central NY, inside letterboxes seem like "just the thing" to get through the Winter.             Budster of the Catskills<br/>

If you want to help insure the box lives a long and happy live, I'd<br/>
probably look to get permission.  =)  Eventually, the powers-that-be<br/>
WILL find out about the box, and it would be nice to know what they<br/>
think before you actually plant it.<br/>
<br/>
I'll only charge one cent for my thoughts instead of the regular two.<br/>

also maybe as an added incentive, maybe you can talk the director into <br/>
offering a FREE library card to any of the locals that may want one..... or suggest <br/>
they libranians have stamps of their on they can use as an exchange project. <br/>
putting clues in the box to go to the desk after stamping in..... with a secret <br/>
code word. LOL, might work<br/>
<br/>
good luck and keep us posted on if you decide to do it<br/>

Syracuse Library links from letterboxing.org  I also plan to do one<br/>
eventually at my University Library.<br/>

If it's a letterbook, I suggest you ask permission.  I have one  <http: <br="">
www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=8311&amp;boxname=Smokin'_Fish&gt;<br/>
, and the librarians are delighted to have it.  Librarians regularly move the <br/>
books around; I think they'd notice a letterbook.  I had a friend  who had her <br/>
letterbox confiscated from the library.<br/>
<br/>
If, however, you are hiding a microbox, then you might want to be a little <br/>
devious.  There are many places where a small magnetized box might not be  <br/>
discovered for a very long time.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to think about if you're hiding it from the librarians is to choose a <br/>
library that gets alot of traffic.  I know the librarians at my local library are <br/>
always very aware when a newcomer visits.<br/>

If you succeed in getting permission, plant it in a "Reference" <br/>
section (Not to be Checked Out).  Those pesky library users kept <br/>
trying to check out letterboxes I knew of in the circulating <br/>
stacks.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want the thrill of planting incognito, and don't care if it <br/>
disappears after a while, try the 800s and 900s sections.  I was <br/>
told these tend to move around less.  Besides, the hiking subject is <br/>
in there somewhere.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We recently planted a letterbook/box in the local library.  We did ask  <br/>
permission and after a few weeks, the children's librarian got the library  <br/>
director to go along with it.  It's planted in the Young Adult section  behind some <br/>
classic books on tape that they swear NEVER get checked out!!<br/>
<br/>
They even asked us to do a session on letterboxing in January.  Guess  we <br/>
can't ask for any more support!!<br/>
<br/>
Now, here's the other side of asking for permission.  We wanted to  plant a <br/>
box on the grounds of the local historical society museum.  A  friend's dad <br/>
whom I've known for years is the President, so he took the box and  information <br/>
to their board of directors.  What did they decide?  That  they didn't want <br/>
people "trapsing around their grounds."  They're a museum  and they don't want <br/>
people around - OMG!!!  So that experience ended my  permission asking days!!!<br/>

I think I would personally still ask permission.  Even if you get a "no,"<br/>
you (or another letterboxer) might get in trouble if they found you<br/>
"trapsing around."  I have just asked permission from our local nature<br/>
center and park board.  Both already have Geocaches set up, so I am pretty<br/>
sure I will get an affirmative answer.  However, if I don't, I would rather<br/>
not let anyone get in trouble over it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could "rewrite" your request for permission?  For instance, go<br/>
find a location first and then present the location to them.  It is possible<br/>
they will see that that particular location would not be a problem if it<br/>
presented high-traffic.  For instance, the Geocache that is set up at our<br/>
Nature Center is way out by the road behind the sign.  Nobody ever goes near<br/>
the sign (except the cachers) and it can't harm any wildlife or plantlife.<br/>
Our History Museum has a cannon (old and non-working) out by the road, as<br/>
well as a sign and some rocks.  I was going to see which is most suitable<br/>
and THEN approach my museum.  Just a thought. :)<br/>

I have been toying with adding a letterbox in my public library.  I <br/>
was thinking that I might approach it by offering to donate a copy of <br/>
a book like A Letterboxer's Companion to the library in exchange for <br/>
planting one small one in far sections of the reference section.<br/>
<br/>
That way I am giving and receiving.  We'll see what they think once I <br/>
get around to finally carving a stamp.<br/>

I took in my letterboxing pack to show my journal and that <br/>

I believe in preparation.  I came armed with the Smithsonian article, the LBNA <br/>
FAQ sheet, and the clues from another library letterbox in our region.  I also <br/>
included examples of my clues and carving. The librarian was then able to <br/>
present the materials to the board (who, I am happy to say, unanimously <br/>
approved the letterbox).<br/>
<br/>
I think it's important to "make a case" to improve chances of success.  In the <br/>
case of a library, explain how a search will encourage library skills.  In the <br/>
case of museum, demonstrate how other museums have embraced <br/>
letterboxing and how planting a box can open up local history, art, culture, etc. <br/>
to new patrons.  Try to tie the letterboxing in with the mission of the <br/>
organization to which you are applying.<br/>
<br/>
I also characterized letterboxers as intelligent, inquisitive people.  If I had <br/>
been  planting the box on the grounds of a library or museum, I would have <br/>
emphasized the "leave no trace" ethic.<br/>

We created the box (actually a paper machie box that looks like a book) and  <br/>
brought it with us to the meeting we had arranged.  We had also planted  <br/>
another box on the library grounds and created a beginner letterboxing kit for  the <br/>
librarian.  At the beginning of our meeting, we gave her the kit and  had her <br/>
follow the directions to the outside box.  This way she had a true  <br/>
letterboxing experience - and was totally hooked!<br/>
<br/>
We brought along copies of written information about letterboxing along  with <br/>
a copy of Randy Hall's book for her to look at.<br/>

Libraries are "renewing" all the time.  We have books that are literally <br/>
falling apart.  If we can't fix it, we get rid of it and replace it with a <br/>
newer more current item.  Books on space exploration published in 1973 seem <br/>
to be a bit different from books published in say 2001 :)<br/>
 Believe me, it pains us to get rid of some books, let alone actually <br/>
destroy.  BUT, you must not look at it as destroying a book.  You are <br/>
recycling the book and giving it a new life.  Besides, if anyone were to <br/>
offer to donate a book as Cadenza has suggested, no library is going to <br/>
refuse a free book if it is current, and despite what many would like to <br/>
think letterboxing is becoming more and more of a popular rage. <br/>
<br/>
 -Since the subject is up... For those of you who have planted library<br/>
boxes: When asking a library for permission, do you prefer to direct<br/>
them to the websites or provide a brief written description of<br/>
letterboxing, or both?  What method do you find is most effective? <br/>
<br/>
Face to face interaction would be best in convincing a libary to house a <br/>
box.  That way you can argue how it would benefit the library.  We love to <br/>
get people into the library despite the shushing we tend to do.  If it is an <br/>
activity that could involve kids, it's even better.  The stealth and leave <br/>
no trace policy can be taught to the younger boxers. <br/>
<br/>
As a final note, speak with the director instead of another staff worker.  <br/>
If you can convince the director, your success in planting in the library <br/>
increases.  Don't leave it to a staff worker to try and argue your case. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for putting my mind at ease. :)  I guess I just didn't take into<br/>
consideration the fact that yes, some books just simply "wear out."<br/>
Personally, I have books that are from the 1800's and still look great, but<br/>
I know that I take better care of books than some people do.  When in<br/>
school, I volunteered at the school library and we were constantly repairing<br/>
damaged books.  It was very rewarding to me to be able to breathe life back<br/>
into these treasures.  Thankfully, we never had to "retire" any while I was<br/>
there... I probably would have cried!  LOL!<br/>
