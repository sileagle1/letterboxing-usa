Greetings fellow LBXers-<br/>
yesterday 1/2 of the TerrapinTraveliers was out and about checking on our <br/>
Boca Boxes<br/>
- here's our report:<br/>
<br/>
Florida Friends: Intact and well hidden<br/>
<br/>
Tiki Idol: Intact and well hidden<br/>
<br/>
Loggerhead: Intact and VERY well hidden- some folks have had trouble <br/>
locating this<br/>
box, it is quite well hidden under some debris, you may have to dig a little <br/>
for it,<br/>
don't give up! - last entry was from Dec. 2002 (Wanda and Pete!)<br/>
<br/>
I also had a chance to check out the recently placed "Snowflakes are <br/>
falling" letterbox<br/>
in Deerfield Beach- thanks DandShoo- haven't had snow in South Florida since <br/>
'77!<br/>
Great box and I picked up a HH during my visit. I'll bring "BannyrCai" on my <br/>
next journey<br/>
- hopefully that will be the final move up north to reunite with the other <br/>
half of the Team.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I ran out of daylight and didn't get over to check out C.L. <br/>
Miller's Morikami box<br/>
to verify it's status- we did stamp in back in December, but it's possible <br/>
that it's been removed<br/>
since then.<br/>
<br/>
Also picked up Disney series "Caribbean Beach" and "Celebration" last <br/>
weekend while<br/>
visiting Mickey and friends- great fun, thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Keep on boxin'<br/>
cheers!<br/>
- Mike<br/>
