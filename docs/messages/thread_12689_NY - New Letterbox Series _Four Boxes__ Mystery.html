The Fingers Letterbox Series (Four boxes, five if you count The Thumb)<br/>
<br/>
If you place your right hand, pointing south, on an appropriately-sized map <br/>
of upstate New York, your fingers might rest on four of New York's <br/>
"fingers," and your fingertips near four boxes.  But where to put your <br/>
thumb?<br/>
<br/>
THE PINKY<br/>
Placed by: JeLyBean<br/>
15 April 2003<br/>
Location: ?<br/>
Terrain: Moderate to challenging - some steep hills and less-traveled <br/>
trails<br/>
Clues: ?<br/>
<br/>
Clues for this box:  The name of this lake is derived from the Iroquois <br/>
word "Kanandarque" which means "chosen spot." It was the legendary <br/>
birthplace and site of the principal village of the Seneca Indians.  On the <br/>
southwest side of this lake is a county park; the county shares its name <br/>
with a Canadian province.  Go to this park and follow the drive until you <br/>
get to the "jump off" point.  Follow the orange blazes until the trail <br/>
begins to veer left away from the valley.  From here, continue to hug the <br/>
edge of the ridge by following the white blazed trail.  Soon it will <br/>
descend into a streambed.  This was flowing in the spring, but I don't know <br/>
if it will be dry in the summer.  At the streambed, leave the trail and <br/>
follow the stream NNE about 150 paces.  North of the stream, about 10 paces <br/>
away is a large piece of red granite with a flat, lichen-covered top. <br/>
  Have a seat near the rock's north end, I did.<br/>
<br/>
Clue for The Thumb:  Once you find this box and stamp in, you'll see a <br/>
picture of a critter well known in these parts.  Where would its home be if <br/>
you misspelled it by changing the second "e" to an "a?"  There's a place <br/>
named this in New York as well, on the edge of the lake you seek.<br/>
<br/>
THE RING<br/>
Placed by: JeLyBean<br/>
03 May 2003<br/>
Location: ?<br/>
Terrain: Moderate - some uphill and a stream crossing<br/>
Clues: ?<br/>
<br/>
Clues for this box:  I have read that the name of this lake may mean either <br/>
"canoe landing" or "crooked" in Iroquois.  Perhaps someone can set me <br/>
straight.  (Excuse the pun, please.)  South of this lake, Back Valley Road <br/>
intersects 54 twice, take the northeastern of these two, and head up <br/>
Winding Stairs.  It quickly becomes a dirt road.  At about 0.7 miles, pull <br/>
off near the small yellow sign for the Finger Lakes Trail (See Finger Lakes <br/>
Trail Conference Map M12, http://www.fingerlakestrail.org) and follow the <br/>
white blazes of the main trail into the woods.  Cross the stream and <br/>
continue uphill.  Where the white blazes leave the old road, follow the <br/>
color of the sky to the end.  From the fire pit, look about for the lone <br/>
paper birch.  If you don't know what a paper birch looks like, the white <br/>
should stand out at about 140*.  From this tree, 30*, 30p, is a pile of <br/>
rocks.  You should be able to see the lake from here.<br/>
<br/>
Clue for The Thumb:  Once you find this box and stamp in, you'll see a <br/>
picture of something that grows well in this region.  On what does it grow? <br/>
 In the place described in THE PINKY's Thumb Clue there's a street with <br/>
this name.  Follow it west to the lake.<br/>
<br/>
THE MIDDLE<br/>
Placed by: JeLyBean<br/>
05 May 2003<br/>
Location: ?<br/>
Terrain: Easy - literally a walk in the park<br/>
Clues: ?<br/>
<br/>
Clues for this box:  The name of this lake is shared with one nation of the <br/>
Iroquois confederacy, who call themselves "People of the Great Hill," <br/>
although the hill in question is located at another lake.  Off the main <br/>
highway that runs along the southern shore of this lake, there is a small <br/>
park dedicated to Warren right on the lake shore.  This park is popular, so <br/>
please be discreet.  Park in the lot (possibly a fee), and head all the way <br/>
to the far eastern end of the park.  A few steps into the brush is a large, <br/>
many-trunked tree.  Debris covers a flat rock at its center.<br/>
<br/>
Clue for The Thumb:  Once you find this box and stamp in, you'll see a <br/>
compass heading.  From the object mentioned in THE INDEX's Thumb Clue, the <br/>
willow tree is at this heading.  Another tree may be in the way.<br/>
<br/>
THE INDEX<br/>
Placed by: JeLyBean<br/>
07 May 2003<br/>
Location: ?<br/>
Terrain: Easy - less than 1 mile round trip on wide level paths<br/>
Clues: ?<br/>
<br/>
Clues for this box:  The name of this lake is shared with another nation of <br/>
the Iroquois confederacy.  In their language, it means, "the mucky land." <br/>
 On its southern shore is Stewart Park, and south of this, the old Wildwood <br/>
Sanctuary.  Park along the road near the southern corner and head for the <br/>
bridges.  Cross the first and head straight into the woods on the path at <br/>
140*.  After a few paces, there's a T intersection, go left and follow the <br/>
path with the waterway along your left until it comes to another T, with a <br/>
wide mulch-covered path.  Go right and follow the path all the way to the <br/>
end, where the ruins are; an arch and a couple of pyramids.  From the arch, <br/>
notice a tree about 20p at 32* back along the path so massive two people  <br/>
 couldn't get their arms around it.  Behind this tree, under the center of <br/>
three logs, under a rock.  You can return the way you came or follow the <br/>
other path from the arch.  Look for signs of deer, beavers, lots of birds. <br/>
 I saw a couple of Northern Ribbon snakes here as well, they're <br/>
non-venomous but please exercise your usual caution when sticking your <br/>
hands into holes or under logs.<br/>
<br/>
Clue for The Thumb:  Once you find this box and stamp in, you'll see a <br/>
picture of an object that's familiar because of this region's tourism <br/>
industry.  In the park at the end of the street mentioned in THE RING's <br/>
Thumb Clue, you'll see one of these by the water's edge.  Go there.<br/>
<br/>
Notes:<br/>
- No ink pads in the boxes, make sure you bring your own since clues to The <br/>
Thumb are on the stamps of The Fingers.<br/>
- These stamps are designed to be stamped together on the same page so they <br/>
form a picture.  In case you decide to do them in random order, here's how <br/>
to make a template so you know where each stamp goes in relation to the <br/>
others.  Draw a rectangle about 4-3/4" long by 2-3/4" high.  From the upper <br/>
left corner draw tick marks along the top at about 1-1/4, 1-3/4, 2-1/2, and <br/>
3-5/8.  From the lower left corner, draw tick marks along the bottom at <br/>
5/8, 1-1/2, 2-1/4, 3-5/8.  Draw straight lines between the top ticks and <br/>
bottom ticks.  Pinky on left, Thumb on right.<br/>
