To answer your other question, a microbox is just a small letterbox, usually in something like a film container, pill bottle, or mini M&amp;M's container. A microbox usually only has the stamp and a roll of paper as the 'logbook'. <br/>
<br/>
They are much easier to hide :-) They are also great for 'urban' boxes where it is hard to find a large enough hiding spot that wouldn't be discovered. When covered with cloth Camo tape (like for gun stocks, not the shiny stuff), they practically disappear in plain sight!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>
