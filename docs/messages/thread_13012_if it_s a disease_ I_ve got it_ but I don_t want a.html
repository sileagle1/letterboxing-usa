                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have laughed at the comments over the last several days on our "sickness."<br/>
I'm glad to know there are others out there doing this in all kinds of<br/>
strange settings-so if the heat does get turned up in hell for us as one of<br/>
you commented (b/c of boxing before weddings, work and even funerals-my<br/>
favorite), we will just have to buy stock in those psychokiwi fireproof<br/>
boxes before we plant some down there!<br/>
<br/>
I think the bug hit me over the last couple of days.  I had to go to Salmon,<br/>
ID for a business trip. I really didn't have time for anything and only<br/>
brought a change of work clothes and something to sleep in.  I found myself<br/>
driving just a little faster so I could plant a box on the way up at some<br/>
charcoal kilns from the 1800's, then after my meetings that night, I hit the<br/>
road to go find the Salmon River's confluence box, but after I realized that<br/>
by the time I found them (in total darkness no less-crossing a river) and<br/>
came back to my hotel room, I would not be getting back until 2 or 2:30 in<br/>
the morning, and I decided (painfully) that the box would have to wait for<br/>
my next trip.<br/>
<br/>
Now that may sound responsible, but I would have still gone in a heartbeat<br/>
if it weren't for the fact that the reason I decided to get some sleep was<br/>
so I could get up at 5:15 to go for a drive and plant some boxes.  One of<br/>
which I drove two hours out of my way to the Montana border to plant just so<br/>
Rockmover and Quiltmaker could have another MT box.  Keep in mind, I am an<br/>
avowed night person.  I NEVER get up before 8 or 9.  Once I managed to get<br/>
enough sugar in me to pretend to be awake, I enjoyed a beautiful drive in<br/>
the mountains and planted a Lewis and Clark microbox, a Montana Crossings<br/>
microbox, and a Sacajawea box.<br/>
<br/>
What I wonder is how strange it must have looked to see a woman in a silk<br/>
blazer, a wool skirt, and dress shoes wandering around the mountains and on<br/>
one occasion, hiding some rocks in the trunk of her company car since one of<br/>
the spots she planted didn't have any rocks or tree stumps of it's own.  I'm<br/>
also hoping my boss doesn't look too close and realize there are an extra<br/>
200 or so miles on the car (:  He already told me it was fine to take the<br/>
scenic route home and enjoy the drive-I just took him at his word!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'll do better on tomorrow's business trip to Jackson Hole.  Oh, hey<br/>
look . . . A-Bear has planted two boxes in Jackson . . . Well, what do you<br/>
know . . .<br/>
<br/>
lovin' it!<br/>
Cadenza<br/>
<br/>
ps. I promise, I'll get back to the Salmon River box and the MT ones I<br/>
didn't have time to find! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh man!  You sound like me!  I almost went out yesterday in a cocktail dress <br/>
and heels, on my way to a school concert to check on a box!  Granted it was on <br/>
a paved trail, not too far from the parking lot, however, it would have <br/>
looked a tad odd!<br/>
<br/>
I am finding that if the weather's nice, I try to box after school, <br/>
especially if I don't have a meeting at night, or have to mow the lawn!  Tuesday, my <br/>
many of my kids were on a field trip, so after only teaching to 10:00 a.m., I <br/>
went off to the Giant and Brooksvale to box until about 3 p.m.  I could have <br/>
done a lot more boxing, if I hadn't had a concert that night!<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the rain today, I may go boxing... depends if the rain holds off <br/>
long enough for me to mow the lawn before the upcoming rainy weekend.  Its <br/>
already long, and I have a feeling that I'll be calling the lawn service before <br/>
long, because my mower won't go through tall grass!  Let's hope it rains today <br/>
so I can box rather than mow lawn!  HE HE<br/>
<br/>
What makes my sickness worse, is that I have about 1/2 the summer off, which <br/>
means, I will be boxing all summer!  I think I need a 12 step program....<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
