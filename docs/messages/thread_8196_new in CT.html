Thank you so much for offering to get this posted.  We have been <br/>
doing this as a family and also last year with my Cub Scout den.  We <br/>
are trying to get the Boy Scouts interested as so many of the <br/>
scouting activities, i.e. compass work, hiking, art, etc are <br/>
encompassed in letterboxing.  There is even a letterbox up at the Boy <br/>
Scout Camp Sequassen in Winsted.  It makes hiking more fun for those <br/>
who don't necessarily like to hike.  The article in the Courant a few <br/>
years back got me interested and I've been passing the word and <br/>
bringing my son's friends with us on hikes.<br/>
<br/>
I've wanted to look for your Hogwart's School boxes but haven't <br/>
gotten there yet.  This fall would be a great time!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we will see you at one of the upcoming Gatherings-thanks again.<br/>
<br/>

Glad you mentioned the one at Camp Sequassen...I put it there when my Boy <br/>
Scout Troop was there for Summer Camp.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in the process of writing up the clues for the three letterboxes placed <br/>
at Deer Lake Scout Reservation in Killingworth CT...<br/>
<br/>
I'll post those when done!<br/>

&gt;(New Letter Box)<br/>
&gt;Box Name: 'Dead Bug Box'<br/>
&gt;City: Meriden<br/>
&gt;State: CT<br/>
&gt;Location: Hubbard Park<br/>
&gt;Date hidden: September 29, 2002<br/>
&gt;Directions:<br/>
&gt;From Interstate 691: Take Exit #4 (W. Main St.) south approx. 1/2<br/>
&gt;mile to Hubbard Park. Enter park on left before pond. Travel around<br/>
&gt;pond on entrance road to rear parking lot across from swimming pool.<br/>
&gt;Walk to swimming pool fence.<br/>
&gt;Clues:<br/>
&gt;Walk north to where ancient Dinosaurs once roamed.<br/>
&gt;Continue with the clock to a wooden rail pathway.<br/>
&gt;Follow the pathway to the 'old skating house'.<br/>
&gt;Look up!...a castle you'll see in the mountains.<br/>
&gt;Continue around the pond toward the park entrance road.<br/>
&gt;Follow the road a short distance until a side road appears on the<br/>
&gt;left.<br/>
&gt;Take the side road to its dead end and a pathway awaits you.<br/>
&gt;Follow this main pathway into the woods.<br/>
&gt;Don't be lead astray by many small side paths along the way.<br/>
&gt;Stay on the main trail until you reach the 'mote bridge' (a metal<br/>
&gt;walkway crossing over the highway)<br/>
&gt;Pass through its 'yellow teeth' and cross the bridge.<br/>
&gt;At the bridge end, turn right and follow the path a short distance to<br/>
&gt;the 'Dead Bug' (a pile of metal and rocks on the right...the metal<br/>
&gt;was once a Volkswagen 'bug'!)<br/>
&gt;From the 'Dead Bug' look up the trail to see a leaning tree.<br/>
&gt;Stay to the right and walk toward the leaning tree (about 60 paces).<br/>
&gt;Notice a large letter 'A' formed by two learning trees.<br/>
&gt;Find a flat rock at the right base leg of the letter 'A'.<br/>
&gt;The Dead Bug Box is under the right side of this flat rock.<br/>
&gt;Enjoy the return trip and watch out for Dinosaurs!<br/>
