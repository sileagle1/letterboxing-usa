<br/>
Thanks for your very nice description of training dogs.  I really <br/>
enjoy working with animals and always appreciate getting new ideas <br/>
for working with my dogs.  Although I have never trained for SAR I <br/>
have been training dogs that I own for about 12 years.  when I said I <br/>
could probably teach my dog in an afternoon I was not trying to play <br/>
down the amount of time it takes to train a dog.  I am talking about <br/>
a 12 yr old AKC utility dog who has been being trained literally <br/>
since she was 8 weeks old.  She &amp; I literaly have thousands of hours <br/>
training together not to mention competing together too.  She also <br/>
knows agility &amp; has done some field work.  I saw this as an extension <br/>
of many of the behaviors she already knows.  Although she is old she <br/>
still has a tremendous amount of drive. <br/>
<br/>
I thought that teaching my younger dogs to find letterboxes might be <br/>
an interesting project. They are way less trained than my older dog.  <br/>
I just haven't put the hours into them that I did with Katie.  A lot <br/>
of the techniques you describe we use for teaching young dogs to <br/>
retrieve birds.  I am going to print out your message.  I will let <br/>
you know how I make out with my project.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
As a retired SAR handler with a canine cadaver recovery dog, I think I can<br/>
give some insight to this question. The whether or not you want to put the<br/>
effort into doing may be another story..LOL.<br/>
<br/>
First you have to determine what it is that you want the dog to find, so<br/>
lets say we pick plastic containers in this case. (as a side note we once<br/>
had a dog on our team that inadvertently learned to alert on plastic because<br/>
the handler always put his scent items in Tupperware..LOL. In his case we<br/>
had to start over with training from step one.)  What you then do is get 3<br/>
or 4 of these plastic containers and then start playing fetch with them.<br/>
This works wonderful if your dog is a natural retriever or ball player. The<br/>
more crazed they get about the container the better. You know when you have<br/>
a really excited dog when as soon as they seen you take down the container<br/>
for play that literally go nuts. While you are working on this step, remove<br/>
the other fetch toys like balls and so forth. You really want to channel the<br/>
dog on the thrill of finding the plastic container.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have a plastic crazy dog that retrieves reliably, start changing<br/>
the situation. Hold the dog back and throw the container into deep grass or<br/>
snow. Let it fall then let the dog go. Once the dog has found it give lots<br/>
of praise and upon brining it back you can even give a food treat reward.<br/>
The more and more successful the dog is, up the level of difficulty to small<br/>
shrubs, large shrubs, dense woods, etc. Once the dog starts to go get it<br/>
reliably and bring it back, start to add a command when you throw the item,<br/>
something like seek or go find works great. If at anytime the dog becomes<br/>
frustrated or fails to find it be sure and go give assistance. The dog<br/>
should always win in these training set ups. Another important thing to<br/>
remember is these sessions need to be SHORT ! Usually 15 mins 2-3 times a<br/>
day is wonderful. You never want the dog to tire of the "game" and you<br/>
always want to leave on a successful training session that has the dog<br/>
wanting more.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have a dog that is 95% successful with all of the above, now start<br/>
having an assistant take the container and go a distance from you and the<br/>
dog and have them yell HEY HEY and then toss it into an area. Let the dog<br/>
watch and then give the command for the dog to go find it. Again, escalate<br/>
this until the person is hardly visible and the item is only very minimally<br/>
seen being tossed. At this point I start playing this game ON LEASH so that<br/>
the dog becomes used to playing the game while on leash. Once you get to the<br/>
point where the dog "knows" the game and starts looking for something to<br/>
happen (container being thrown), you can then have the person just drop it<br/>
into the bushes and send the dog to go find it.  Do this for a while until<br/>
the dog is very successful at finding it, say 95% or better. Always be sure<br/>
that you reward the dog with lots of praise and some tasty food treat when<br/>
the situation is successful. If ever there is difficulty, or the dog is<br/>
having lots of trouble, back up and make things easier. Often times, success<br/>
makes us jump ahead too soon and the key to understanding the need to slow<br/>
down and back up is seeing unsuccessful attempts.<br/>
<br/>
Now say we have taken our time with training and everything is going<br/>
wonderful. at this point we can now start to set up some actual finds. Start<br/>
with having your assistant go out and place a container in a hidden area.<br/>
Wait a few minutes and then go send the dog. Again, when the dog is<br/>
successful reward. At this point most people will want to switch over to<br/>
some other type of alert, as most folks probably don't want to have<br/>
someone's dog chomping all over their beloved letterbox! The first step to<br/>
teaching this is deciding what type of alert you want the dog to give when<br/>
the container has been detected. Most common are barking, sitting, and lying<br/>
down. Once you decide what alert you want, you need to work separately on<br/>
getting the dog to do this behavior on a cue. Once your dog does it 100% of<br/>
the time on your cue, then it is time to bring the two behaviors together.<br/>
<br/>
See, I never said this was easy...LOL<br/>
<br/>
The next step is to combine these two behaviors. Take the plastic container<br/>
you have been using for the fetch game and now put it in an unreachable<br/>
place or container. I used a wooden box with holes drilled in it for scent<br/>
to escape. he location or container needs to be dog proof, so that the dog<br/>
can't actually get the item, but located so it can easily smell the item.<br/>
Once you have placed the plastic item and have it set up, then take the dog<br/>
to the area you want to start and give the dog a command. The dog should be<br/>
on leash and you need to be sure to be able to keep up..LOL I also recommend<br/>
the use of a harness for this (which you can use from the very beginning)<br/>
for two reasons: 1) the change from a leash on the collar to a leash on a<br/>
harness clues the dog in that it is going to be playing the fun game and 2)<br/>
if the leash gets snagged or you fall the dog won't get a correction for<br/>
doing what you want him/her to do, which is try it's hardest to find this<br/>
container. (Trust me, you get better at following with experience..=)))<br/>
<br/>
While the dog is looking be enthusiastic and encouraging, "that's it what a<br/>
great dog you are". Once you get to the location and the dog gets to the<br/>
container make a huge deal of it..WOW WHAT'S THAT IS SOMETHING THERE..YOU<br/>
GONNA GET IT...etc. The more excited and like a raving idiot you are the<br/>
better. Once the dog is geeked and is trying to get into the container, then<br/>
give your alert signal (the down, bark, etc) and once the dog does it....<br/>
huge praise and lots of treats!!!<br/>
<br/>
Whew..lotta work isn't it!!  If you made it this far, you are in like flynn.<br/>
At this point you have all the training necessary to be successful and the<br/>
next steps are just working the situation in many different areas and in<br/>
different conditions. Eventually, the dog will start to offer the alert on<br/>
his/her own when the box is found and you won't have to give the cue for it.<br/>
Sometimes to I take a special toy that I give the dog as a reward after the<br/>
box is found and I use it just like the plastic container in the beginning<br/>
steps. I play tug or fetch with it and it tends to redirect the dog's desire<br/>
to want to grab the box. As soon as the dog gives the alert on a found<br/>
container (one that I know the location of), I then throw and tug with the<br/>
other toy as the reward. Only after the dog is rewarded do I then turn my<br/>
attention back to the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
LOL...now what I have given is a brief overview....LOL. You may have other<br/>
issues arise as every dog and person is different, but this is a review of<br/>
the basics of how scent work and detection is taught. I hope this helps<br/>
everyone interested and please feel free to email me with specific<br/>
questions. I am happy to help! Also, I would be interested in progress if<br/>
anyone does decide to try training this!!<br/>

&gt; How do you train dogs to alert on certain scents? I've seen them do<br/>
&gt; explosives and narcotics daily on my commute through a nuclear<br/>
&gt; submarine base gates...and I'd love to work on "where's the box?"<br/>

Having done field training you have a huge jump on training! My oldest<br/>
Border Collie used to do pick up work for the hunt tests and it was amazing<br/>
how the retrieve drive can be used in so many ways. Truthfully, I think the<br/>
more training a dog has the more receptive it makes they to learning new<br/>
things and the faster they learn. My old dog, like yours, had the benefit of<br/>
all my time and training for many years and I can see the difference with my<br/>
younger dogs that had less time put in. The old gal is the rock when it<br/>
comes to doing anything and the younger ones as so so. If only I could be<br/>
cloned..LOL<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how the training comes along, I would love to know.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
