&gt; My name is Holly and I am a producer on THE CAROL DUVALL SHOW on<br/>
&gt; HGTV.  I am pitching a field piece on letterboxing.  Oregon seems<br/>
&gt; to be the state with the most letterboxes closest to Los Angeles.<br/>
&gt; Are there ever organized trips to find the boxes that we could<br/>
&gt; possibly film??  I would apprecaite any information you could give<br/>
&gt; me!<br/>
<br/>
Hi Holly.  That's really interesting.  My name is Dan Servatius and<br/>
I'm a host along with several other people who are members of the<br/>
Letterboxing USA talk list.  I hale from Minnesota.  Our web page<br/>
(which it seems likely you have already visited) is<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf or http://www.letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
We've not had an organized trip that I'm aware of in Oregon but the<br/>
Oregon delegates might be willing to host such an event.  They are<br/>
Mitch Klink - mailto:letterboxr@aol.com<br/>
and<br/>
Thom Cheney - mailto:tcgrafx@imagina.com<br/>
<br/>
I'm copying this note to our talk list because the members of our<br/>
group may be interested in hearing about this.  Let me know if there<br/>
is anything else I can do for you.  I think one of our other members<br/>
from out east is visiting the Portland area in the near future and<br/>
might possibly be interested in an event if the timing is right.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your interest in what we're doing.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI all, We received a stamped card in the mail from a new letterboxer in the <br/>
St. Louis area...I asked if they had checked out our box at Turtle Park ( we <br/>
were afraid it was too "urban" and easy to find) and received this email <br/>
note: ENJOY<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Hello,<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks so much for getting back to us so quickly!  Now we don't feel like <br/>
 were all alone out here :).  Turtle park, huh.  (I'm glad you confirmed that <br/>
 it may have been poached.) Actually, that was the very first stamp we went <br/>
 out for on April 1st.   We thought it might not be there at first but when <br/>
 we saw the actual location, I thought it looked like a likely place to bury <br/>
 a box. You might be amused to know that I spent 20 minutes digging in the <br/>
 mouth with my legs hanging out of the top.  My sidekicks told me that, <br/>
 although I was trying to be discreet, people in the park came over en masse <br/>
 to see what was going on and thought there was someone in the snake's mouth <br/>
 that we were trying to get out.  We started to think that the hiders were <br/>
 watching out the windows of the nearby buildings and laughing there heads <br/>
 off at us.  Needless to say, we got no stamp and the sidekicks have yet to <br/>
 let me live down that fiasco:)  You said you hid it quickly.  Do you set out <br/>
 to plant boxes or do you have stuff with you when you venture out and place <br/>
 boxes where that looks good?  <br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids and I were sad to have lost the box but the story made up for it!<br/>

I have forwarded your request.  I'm sure someone will be glad to do<br/>
this for you and will contact you directly (mailto:Gaudet2@email.msn.com).<br/>
You may have more volunteers that you can handle :-)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

&gt; My name is Scott Gaudet and I'm the Gifted and Talented teacher for the city<br/>

&gt; and thought that it would be something my students would be interested in.<br/>
&gt; This site is very helpful, but I'd love to have my students meet a<br/>
&gt; "letterboxer".  Do you know of someone in my area that would talk to us and<br/>
&gt; help us start?  Any help would be appreciated.<br/>
