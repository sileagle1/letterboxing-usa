                    <div class="plaintext-content">My son and I have just started letterboxing.  I heard about geocaching<br/>
a few years ago and was instantly intrigued, but since I do not own a <br/>
GPS and had no intent on purchasing one, I figured that it was <br/>
something we'd have to try eventually but couldn't do just then.<br/>
Much to my delight, however, my Family Fun subscription provided this <br/>
fantastic alternative.  My son loves map-reading, using a compass, <br/>
and figuring out clues, so this is a great thing to do together.<br/>
We live in the Baltimore area and plan to travel to neighboring <br/>
states to visit boxes once we've found the ones listed for Maryland.<br/>
We also planted our first box last weekend in Pasadena.  I didn't get <br/>
over there before they closed the park due to Isabel, so I'll have to <br/>
go tomorrow afternoon and make sure that it didn't become a victim of <br/>
the weather.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm glad that I found this list and look forward to great fun!<br/>
