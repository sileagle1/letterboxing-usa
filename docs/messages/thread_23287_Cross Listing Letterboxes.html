Hi Jackbear<br/>
There is a contact the webmasters function on the bottom of the LbNA <br/>
home page and possibly that might get you a quicker response. I <br/>
still believe that it is possible to post your clues on both sites. <br/>
We have ours hosted on LbNA and have established a link at AQ for <br/>
those clues. I know there are several folks that have their own site <br/>
and link their clues to both. Since this will effect several <br/>
letterboxers that post on both sites I would hope that the <br/>
Webmasters might reconsider for those that like the simplicity of <br/>
being able to just click a button.<br/>
