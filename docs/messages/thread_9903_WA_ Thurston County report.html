                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went , of course, to Priest Point Park to see what the Nails have <br/>
crafted.<br/>
<br/>
Great set of boxes.  Fun stamps that for the life of me I cannot <br/>
figure how were made with such small figures.  Dremmel tool?<br/>
<br/>
DVN2R SKR reports that she was held up in her quest for the boxes <br/>
yesterday due to Police Action in the Park.  Well since all boxes are <br/>
in place I assume the police action was not due to brightly colored <br/>
boxes and suspicious skulking people.<br/>
<br/>
I had to check in on the First Thanksgiving Box to see if the Nails <br/>
finally nailed it.  They DID!  Isn't that a GREAT TREE???<br/>
<br/>
I met an Alien HH ( perhaps it was he the police were after?) and <br/>
gave him a ride to another Thurston County venue.  I visited three <br/>
venues in all on this beautiful crystal clear blue day.  I love Puget <br/>
Sound Country.  25 miles to the north at my home it is gray-black and <br/>
threatening to rain.  Here it is amazing and sparkling.<br/>
<br/>
I was thrilled to see that one of my favorite works of public art has <br/>
moved to a location close to one venue and can be enjoyed by the <br/>
large number of people who pass by on HWY 101.  The Bovine Family is <br/>
delightful and was a work of love by the artist.<br/>
<br/>
Highlight of the day was Fudrick's Bonus Box.  A cunning box which <br/>
holds the honorary third place finisher in the 2002 Crappy Stamp <br/>
Contest.<br/>

Nailhead carved them by hand with the aid of Speedball #1 and <br/>
#5 and a sharp pencil tip.  We were slightly dissapointed with the <br/>
size of the dominoes but were under pressure to finish since we <br/>
had got home late from church on Wed night and had to leave <br/>
early Thus morn for our family gathering in Oregon for <br/>
Thanksgiving.  Also, we had a lot of difficulty with the dimensions <br/>
of the dice.  Not bad for crappy stamp carvers though, even if I <br/>
say so myself.<br/>

By the by, did you happen to come across a Snow Globe today?  <br/>
If you did, you will see an example of the underpublished talents <br/>

soon.<br/>
