Isle this week and along our travels captured 2 little letterbox<br/>
images by Illia.  The first we found was at Kylemore Abby in the<br/>
western part of the country.  In a very unique spot but,<br/>
unfortunately, the box was full of water.  The log book was soaked<br/>
but I believe we were the first finders.  Stamped in on a page from<br/>
my log book which we left in the plastic bag that held the stamp. <br/>
The stamp was nice and dry. Of course I had not carried all of our<br/>
replacement baggies so we were not able to help out any better. <br/>
<br/>
Our travels then took us into No. Ireland and eventually back to the<br/>
Hill of Tara outside of Dublin where we found our second box.  This<br/>
box was located in the area where sheep roamed freely and watching<br/>
where we stepped was of prime importance.  Also, the ground was wet<br/>
from recent rain so we got a little messy getting this box.  I'm not<br/>
too keen on reaching my bare hand into a stone wall cavity that I<br/>
cannot see into, but we did manage to retrieve what we sought. I had<br/>
to change my sneakers after that trip, however. <br/>
<br/>
We needed one more day to reach the area where a third box for which<br/>
we had clues was residing, but didn't make it because of the<br/>
necessity of catching the plane back home.  We had a great trip and<br/>
did check out Slieve League (Now THERE'S a spot you won't visit on a<br/>
tour bus!)<br/>
the Giant's Causeway and the Rope Ladder. Beautiful spots and the<br/>
whole trip was such fun. On another trip, (who knows when in the<br/>
future) we'll have to reverse our direction and begin in the<br/>
Killarney area.  And perhaps Illia will have a few more of her boxes<br/>
place.  I'm sure we'll try again one of these years.<br/>

Thanks for the report, Bell Lady!  I write a travel website about<br/>
Ireland, and I will have to create webpages about letterboxing around<br/>
the Emerald Isle... great idea!  Thanks!<br/>

The sheep incident sounds so familiar!  It was very similar when Bluebird and I visited Dartmoor.  Most portions of Dartmoor are grazing fields, so you hike and search for boxes in with the animals.  There were sheep, cattle, horses, goats etc every where we went.  I had a herd of cows follow me to Nun's Cross (I got a little nervous about that) on our last day there.  I wasn't letterboxing at that point, just wanted to see the gravesite, but it was really funny!<br/>

Where did you find the listings for letterboxes in Ireland?  we are headed<br/>
that way ourselves, and might try to catch a few.  Is there an international<br/>
site?    Mary Anne<br/>
