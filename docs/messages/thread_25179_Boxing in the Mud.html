I decided I had to get out of the house for a short bit yesterday. So I went scouting, trying to hunt up some good clue ideas for a box I'm planning. However, it was so muddy, I didn't get too far. One of the roads was washed out, and my car bottomed out. I was afraid I was going to be stuck out there! But I pulled through it. One of the places I went to look at was completely closed.
