Dog owners, bring a bowl for your dog to eat or drink from. We will provide water and you may feed them any of the human food that is available or you can bring their own favorite dog food. Letterboxing children are as welcome as the adults. Kids are the future of the Letterboxing hobby. Let them learn here......Chuck and Molly<br/>
