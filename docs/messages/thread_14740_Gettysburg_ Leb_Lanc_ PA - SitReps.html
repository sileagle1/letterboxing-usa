Whew!  A great two days of Letterboxing on and off....<br/>
<br/>
July 31:<br/>
       The Barb of the Hook (Gettysburg, PA).  GREAT trip around the <br/>
historical markers, etc., of Gettysburg battlefield(s).  Box in great shape; but so <br/>
many BUGS!  Took an 11 year old first time 'boxer out for her first run at it <br/>
("Brighteyes"), and she was SOOO excited about her first find - she loved it, <br/>
and she was very excited that it was a handcarved stamp!  :)<br/>
<br/>
July 31:<br/>
       Happy Trails (Boiling Springs, PA).  WeLetterbox pair has already <br/>
visited this site, but "Brighteyes" wanted to find it, so we drove her.  Again, <br/>
box in great shape, and lots of visitors!! :)  Still one of our favorite stamps <br/>
(it was our first find back in May!)<br/>
<br/>
August 1:<br/>
       Bridges of Lancaster (Lancaster Co., PA).  While the tour directions <br/>
seem to be QUITE out of date now (no fault of this placer...she's keeping up on <br/>
as many of the changes/errors as she hears of), we had a really nice drive <br/>
around the area - we live about an hour away and have really never taken the <br/>
time to drive through - thank you for the "excuse!"  :)  Found the box - SAFE AND <br/>
SOUND!  Notebook is so small!  We had to get creative with our big personal <br/>
stamp.  Think we'll carve a new one to accommodate the small boxes we find!  :) <br/>
 Absolutely loved this hide.  Did some research beforehand to "guess the <br/>
bridge," and we were RIGHT!  Very exciting for us...we did the whole drive from <br/>
top to bottom anyway - just to be sure.  <br/>
       *This Carving was INCREDIBLE!  We're still in awe of SpringChick on <br/>
this one!<br/>
<br/>
August 1:<br/>
       Buggy Box (Lancaster Co., PA)  Beautiful spot!  Two little boys came <br/>
to fish as we were leaving, and it was so neat to see!  :)  The box was full of <br/>
water, and I'm afraid we couldn't salvage the green paper inside, but we <br/>
managed to dry the stamp, ink (still works just fine, once we soaked out some of <br/>
the water!), and logbook.  Replaced baggies.  Looks like it's an active <br/>
box...and another small book!  (Now we're convinced that we must re-carve into a mini <br/>
stamp!)  Cute carving, by the way!<br/>
<br/>
August 1:<br/>
       Governor Dick Tower (Mt. Gretna, PA)  YEAH!!!  Arrived around 7:30pm, <br/>
and made quite a hike up!  Found the box with a little difficulty (many trees <br/>
have fallen around there of late, it appears!)....and...THE HATBOX CAPER <br/>
HITCHHIKER "DICK"!  A wonderful surprise! :)  The log book is very nice and the box <br/>
is in great shape!  Although it is posted as abandoned on the <br/>
letterboxing.org site, there are owner postcards in the box.  We're sending one to see if the <br/>
owner is aware of the abandoned posting.  If so, we plan to adopt.  Mt. <br/>
Gretna is BEAUTIFUL, and any excuse to visit is welcomed!  Plan also to return to <br/>
climb the Tower and check out the view again - hiked out in the near-dark and <br/>
fog, so the tower provided little view.  <br/>
<br/>
       The Hatbox Caper Hitchhiker "Dick" - looks like someone stamped this <br/>
book believing it to be the log for Governor Dick Tower and never took the <br/>
hiker with them!  So now we have him and are quite excited.  Our giddy plan on <br/>
where to take him next are already formulating.  We'll post when we've released <br/>
him again!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to EVERYONE who hid these great "finds!"  <br/>
Must....Go....Again.......  :)<br/>
<br/>
Smiles,<br/>
