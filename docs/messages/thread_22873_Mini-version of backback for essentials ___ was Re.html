Oh, and my compass. And maybe some Marvey Markers. And some spare <br/>
ziplock baggies. And maybe a micro-box to plant while I'm there? Ok, <br/>
I'll need a change of shoes. And jeans. And a rain coat. <br/>

&gt; Hello, <br/>
&gt;   I'm a relative newbie...12 boxes in Sept when I started<br/>
&gt;   2 in october I was busy<br/>
&gt;   12 yesterday.<br/>
&gt;   I have tried various systems to carry all the 'STUFF' needed for <br/>
me and then 'stuff' just in case the box needs help...<br/>
&gt;   so OLD TIMERS  (this in not age related)<br/>
&gt;   how do you carry your stuff?<br/>
&gt;   how do you mark in?  (sometimes it takes both my husband, me and <br/>
a  nearby fallen tree to hold---log books, box, pen, 3 stamps, stamp <br/>
pads,  baggies, papertowel wrap for stamp....etc.<br/>
&gt;   How do you manage all this stuff?<br/>
&gt;   just curious and wanting some ideas...my 12 yesterday were all in <br/>
one  park, so i shoved my stamps pen and ink in one pocket, compass <br/>
around  my neck and carried my book and a frisbee to hold the stuff <br/>
while i  marked in.  it was okay, but I still think i need some <br/>
expert  advise....help please... <br/>
