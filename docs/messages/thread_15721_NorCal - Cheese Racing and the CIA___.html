I do realize that the Patriot Act has outlawed certain practices that <br/>
can be construed as being related to Cheese Racing, but the ACLU <br/>
still does have a lawsuit pending against these restrictions, and I <br/>
believe that in absence of tort law, we, as Americans, still do enjoy <br/>
the right to Cheese Race in the pursuit of happiness.  We may have to <br/>
endure helicoptor reconaissance, and the infiltration of letterbox <br/>
groups by CIA operatives, but we have nothing to hide (--well, except <br/>
letterboxes).<br/>

&gt; Dear Friends and Stampers everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I cannot remember a finer time than we had at the Norcal Event, <br/>
Sept <br/>
&gt; 16, 2003. As I told Double Sag as we left, "You folks set the bar <br/>
&gt; pretty darned high!" That goes for everyone who was there. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; An event like that takes planning, coordination, and service from <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; folks who "run" it. From securing the park site to getting that <br/>
&gt; mailbox, carving and planting the boxes to making sure there was <br/>
&gt; charcoal, med kits, and water there, all those things needed the <br/>
&gt; locals' attention. Further, all the folks who showed up we so <br/>
darned <br/>
&gt; friendly and helpful, too. That was evident. We had toddlers to <br/>
&gt; seniors out there enjoying the day. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As JugglerMouse put it, "It was like we were at a family reunion <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; cousins we had never met." I put in, "Yeah, but nobody got drunk, <br/>
&gt; mad, or made inappropriate come-ons to anyone." <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, we did not feel free to cheeserace there. You have seen the <br/>
&gt; polls (posted in the polls section of this site.) You know how <br/>
split <br/>
&gt; the vote is. If only more of you had voted! IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO <br/>
&gt; VOTE, you know. You may vote even if you have no intention of <br/>
cheese <br/>
&gt; racing and none of being at the SLO Stamping in the Meadow, Oct <br/>
4th. <br/>
&gt; It is like the California Recall election: it is free to the voters <br/>
&gt; (okay, not true about the recall), it has a lot of silly choices, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; will probably be meaningless overall. See? You should vote or you <br/>
&gt; will have no excuse for complaining - and no one wants that!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I put some photos up in the Photo section on the site (the Nor Cal <br/>
&gt; folder had already been created.) Surely there were more pics of <br/>
&gt; individuals. Come on, folk! I apologize for forgetting the names of <br/>
&gt; the lovely trio wearing the black hats (and the blonde baby). Can <br/>
&gt; someone help me there? I will ammend the caption under "Group with <br/>
&gt; Double Sag" once I get that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here are somethings to look for at SLO Stamping, Oct 4th:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Easier terrain - if hard hikes are your thing, we do have some <br/>
stamps <br/>
&gt; nearby that will challenge you, but the event site is wheelchair <br/>
&gt; friendly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; An Event Stamp - Emily Rose has promised us a double-sided one, <br/>
too. <br/>
&gt; I understand that the other event stamps will get here, too. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Randomized Clue List - since the park is so small, we will most <br/>
&gt; likely have the boxes in differing orders so more folk can get the <br/>
&gt; thrill of decoding them by themselves. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Food - we are still encouraging potluck fare but we will have at <br/>
&gt; least hot dogs (probably chicken dogs) and a few veggie entres. <br/>
Those <br/>
&gt; attending should consider bringing other things. There are soda <br/>
&gt; machines on site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fake rock display - I will bring some examples and may well carve <br/>
&gt; some for you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Juggling lessons - JugglerMouse has promised to teach anyone <br/>
&gt; interested. She is a very good teacher and very encouraging.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lots of Exchanges<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A local list of boxes fairly close to the site - now if they are <br/>
&gt; boxes which need decoding, such as my Middle Earth series, I would <br/>
&gt; advise you to have them worked upon already. No gimmes; you would <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; respect me for that, would you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, if you can show me two of the Redwall series, I have <br/>
Urthstripe <br/>
&gt; the Badger to stamp in your book. If you can show JugglerMouse two <br/>
&gt; from Redwall, she has a new Martin the Warrior. Both are countable <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; finds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks, again, to the NorCal gathering. Y'all come on down South to <br/>
&gt; San Luis (pronounced "Lewis") Obispo on October 4th.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
