Let me start by saying that we have not planted...yet.  But, we would be thrilled to adopt boxes in our area.  I think that posting for adoptive boxers is a great solution.  Of course...we may be biased...we adopted our daughter!  Happy to help if we can....we are in the Fairfield/Vacaville area.  But always willing to drive!<br/>

FYI, I'm 'killing' off any of my 'orphaned' letterboxes that go <br/>
missing.  I figure with the recent 'surge' in popularity in <br/>
letterboxing this past summer that the area will eventually be <br/>
deluged with letterboxes anyway.  I'm leaving the clues with a <br/>
GIANT 'confirmed missing' notation on the LBNA site for a bit so <br/>
folks see that it really is missing.  After a few months, <br/>
I'm 'killing' the LBNA link to the clues but will keep the clues <br/>
active on my personal website in the event I may return to the 'far <br/>
away' spot in the future--at which time, I'll decide whether or not <br/>
to 'revive' that particular letterbox or just let it RIP.<br/>

Just to add a little humor to this whole thread (this is all in jest <br/>
and refers entirely to letterboxes that I've planted, of course)--<br/>
it does sound pretty bad, doesn't it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm killing off my disappearing orphans.  But I'm not just limiting <br/>
it to that, I'm also nixing my missing homegrown locals. <br/>
Occasionally, I'm even eliminating my hitchhikers, as well.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's nothing to cry over though, most of them were pretty awful <br/>
specimens to begin with!  Thankfully, the vandals have helped in <br/>
the 'non-survival of the not-so-fittest' letterboxes I've planted <br/>
thoughout the past couple of years.  Fortunately, the true gems <br/>
involving most of my letterboxes were the locations in which the <br/>
boxes were hidden and thankfully those treasures still exist--<br/>
letterbox host or not!<br/>

I would definitely update the clues with a note that the box <br/>
was "reported missing but not confirmed by the planters".  It is <br/>
very frustrating to go search for a box and not find it, when the <br/>
planters knew there may be a problem.  That way I may look for it if <br/>
I am in the area, but would not drive a long distance for it.<br/>
<br/>
One box I am maintaining is a little ways from home.  I posted a <br/>
note in the clues that it is up for adoption.  I haven't got any <br/>
takers yet.  You may want to try that idea for your far away boxes.  <br/>
See if it works.  I got most of my boxes through adoption.<br/>

it help maintain it. Just an idea,<br/>
