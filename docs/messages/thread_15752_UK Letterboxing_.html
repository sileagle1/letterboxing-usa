                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have read over the past months with great interest about the <br/>
exploits of all of you US letterboxers.  Strangely enough, although <br/>
there are several websites, there isn't an obvious Yahoo group for <br/>
letterboxing in the UK.   So, I started one.  <br/>
http://uk.groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-uk/<br/>
<br/>
I created it with the idea of working along side the letterbox-usa <br/>
group, (although I have no links with the moderators other than <br/>
their blessing).  Like the US group, I would welcome people from <br/>
anywhere in the world, but if you are planning on visiting (or live <br/>
in) the UK, or have any stories or questions or clues (both on and <br/>
off Dartmoor) which would be more suited to be posted to a UK group, <br/>
please feel free to join and check it out.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure between the two groups there will be a place for a large <br/>
proportion of the worlds letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Kindest regards<br/>
