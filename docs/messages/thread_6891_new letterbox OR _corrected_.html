&gt; On August 7, 2002 Funhog placed the Old Growth Letterbox along the Founder's Trail in the Audubon Sanctuary in Portland, Multnomah County, Oregon. This trail received a great deal of damage during the <br/>
&gt; 1996 flood season but today you will be able to see the recovery of the forest in the landslide areas. <br/>
&gt; There are stands of old growth all along the 3/4 mile trail. Watch for large western hemlock, Douglas fir <br/>
&gt; and western red cedar. You may even be lucky enough to spot a pileated woodpecker amongst the trees.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To the trailhead:<br/>
&gt; From downtown Portland head west on NW Lovejoy which turns into NW Cornell Rd. The Audubon Nature <br/>
&gt; House is about 3/4 mile from the second tunnel on the right side. Park here Trail maps are located in a <br/>
&gt; cupboard by the entrance to the Nature Store. The trail starts across the road behind the maintenance <br/>
&gt; shop.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To the letterbox:<br/>
&gt; Walk straight past the spot where the babies grow. When you have reached the point of highest elevation, <br/>
&gt; you will spot a standing snag on your right adorned with many bracket mushrooms. Twenty six steps <br/>
&gt; beyond you will come to a venerable brother. An exposed root  and a piece of loose wood shelter this tiny <br/>
&gt; letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
