&gt; I am looking at a linear, 4 day 3 night hike consisting of 26 miles starting at Crawford Notch at US 302, north bound on the AT, over the top of washington to Pinkham Notch visitor center. I figure 6&gt; <br/>

This is very doable. It is a really a two-day one-night hike, and is <br/>
not anywhere near 26 miles long, unless you are doing a lot of side <br/>
trips.<br/>
<br/>
I did this same hike last summer with two of my children (Anne-12 and <br/>
David-10). We started at Crawford and hiked up to Mizpah Hut (Very <br/>
short day, but we had a three hour drive to get there). Next day the <br/>
southern Presidentials, and stayed at Lakes of the Clouds Hut. The <br/>
last day was up to Washington (again) and then down Tuckerman Ravine <br/>
Trail (Lions Head, actually, as TR was closed for maintenance) to <br/>
Pinkham.<br/>
<br/>
If you have an extra day, you can do the northern peaks and come back <br/>
down the fourth day to either Pinkham or to Dolly Copp campground.<br/>
<br/>
The AMC shuttle can be a big help in getting back to your car. Or to <br/>
your starting point - it's better to leave your car at your end <br/>
point.<br/>
