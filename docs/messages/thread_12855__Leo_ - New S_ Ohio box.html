Leo<br/>
<br/>
Nestled in the wooded hills of Jackson County, Ohio is a quiet little <br/>
park administered by the Ohio Historical Society.  It protects an <br/>
exposed slab of sandstone where ancient Native Americans carved what <br/>
are believed to be sacred symbols.  (Interesting that nobody ever <br/>
thinks these things are just prehistoric graffiti huh?)  It's a <br/>
lovely, quiet little place that most folks never are aware of or <br/>
think to go.  Hidden somewhere in this wooded retreat is our friend <br/>
Leo.  He's sort of a familiar face around here and if you follow the <br/>
clues carefully you can add him to your collection.<br/>
	Go to the Leo Petroglyph State Memorial that is located about <br/>
4 miles off US Route #35 west of Jackson.  The turn off US Route #35 <br/>
is marked with brown and white directional signs and is about 4  5 <br/>
miles from the city of Jackson.  Just follow the signs to the quaint <br/>
little park that has a timber and stone shelter over the carvings.  <br/>
You need to go to the picnic area at the far end of the parking area <br/>
from the carvings.  There, you should find 3 truncated pyramids.  <br/>
Stand by the eastern-most pyramid and take a bearing of 214 and walk <br/>
12 paces.  (1 pace = 2 steps)  You should be standing at the edge of <br/>
the woods near a small trail that leads down into the woods.  Follow <br/>
the trail about 20 paces.  Stop and look to the east.  You should see <br/>
fair sized, badly decayed log lying in a roughly North  South <br/>
direction about 4 paces off the trail and a couple of paces North of <br/>
the log see a large tree with an unusual bump at the bottom of the <br/>
south side of the trunk.  You should find Leo hiding on the East side <br/>
of this tree under a couple of smaller dead branches lying against <br/>
the trunk. (Note: This is a microbox so please bring a stamp-pad and <br/>
pencil with you!)  Please email us at bigguy_45640@yahoo.com and let <br/>
us know how he's doing if you find him.<br/>
