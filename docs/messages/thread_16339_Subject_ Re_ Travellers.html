&gt; Dear Steve, et al,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had not announced it. There is a small conflict within our hearts.<br/>
&gt; You see, Hunt for the Jersey Devil is happening the same weekend as<br/>
&gt; the Fright one you are holding. True, yours is a day earlier, but<br/>
&gt; they did ask first. You see our dilemma, don't you?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We called up the shade of the wisest guy we knew. No, not Danny<br/>
&gt; Devito, he is still alive. Instead, we made that chalk outline of an<br/>
&gt; interlocking double triangle and invoked Solomon. Sol, as he now<br/>
&gt; likes to be called, advised us to split the event stamps up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We will be sending the Pacific NW Event and legerdemaine's KMartha<br/>
&gt; event stamps up to Team Rayvenhaus. We will be sending Opraha, A<br/>
&gt; Little Birdie Told Me, and the newest event box - Cheese Racing<br/>
&gt; Ballot Box - out to New Jersey. If you and the Jersey folk wish to<br/>
&gt; argue it out (off the board, please) and swap some stamps around, do<br/>
&gt; so but let us know before Tuesday, the next day mail can go out.<br/>
&gt; JugglerMouse will mail the boxes then.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this manages to cheese-off the fewest folks possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As Ricky Nelson so succinctly put it, "You can't cheese everyone, so<br/>
&gt; you gotta cheese yourself!"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your Googled Brother and Sisters,<br/>
&gt; Sir B, JugglerMouse, and Ash Raven<br/>
