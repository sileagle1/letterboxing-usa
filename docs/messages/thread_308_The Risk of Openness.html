                    <div class="plaintext-content">After hearing of the latest rift of missing boxes I thought something<br/>
should be said.  I had a message drafted and I decided not to send<br/>
it out because it was sort of whiny.  Then I chatted with Nisa and<br/>
she helped me to put this into perspective.  I think what we have<br/>
here is a risk of lost letterboxes due to the openess of our site.<br/>
<br/>
It is not unlike the loss faced when being open with people in<br/>
relationships and having those people take advantage of the fact<br/>
that you have been open.  So then you come up with clever ways to mask<br/>
what is going on beneath the surface (the pain of loss, of being<br/>
taken advantage of for being open) and in order to protect yourself<br/>
you come up with ever cleverer means (become more cryptic) for relating<br/>
to people, and you then relate to certain people you view as being "on<br/>
the inside" -- you become exclusive.  This is the current mode of<br/>
thinking in some circles of letterboxers -- that you have to become<br/>
(or remain) exclusive in order to protect what you have.  I'm sure<br/>
this has driven some of the adverse reactions to suggestions which<br/>
have been made to promote or advertise the hobby.  The thinking goes<br/>
like this:  If you promote the hobby more people will know about it,<br/>
and if more people know about it more letterboxes may be ruined.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I don't think this is as prevalent as it was before the <br/>
Smithsonian article and before Letterbox USA.  I'm only bringing it<br/>
up for the sake of perspective.  Remember that the people who were<br/>
most fearful of this were the ones who then ruined some of Adrian's<br/>
letterboxes in order to "make him think twice".  No, exlusivity is<br/>
NOT the solution.  There apparently are vandals within our ranks,<br/>
even among our friends in Dartmoor, so there is no reason to point<br/>
an accusing finger "out there" to the public domain (the internet).<br/>
People will make trouble whether you use the internet or not and<br/>
whether you advertise in the Smithsonian or not.<br/>
<br/>
BUT/, we can hope against them, and we can plot new strategies.<br/>
<br/>
I was chatting with Nisa the other night trying to figure out what<br/>
I might do about the vandalism and she was about to say something<br/>
like (I thought), "If you put out more boxes they will just take<br/>
those too."  She actually did not say that.  It was just what I was <br/>
thinking at the time.  What she did say was, "I hope they don't take<br/>
any more."  Well, those words are very enlightening.  We CAN hope.<br/>
Hope is always better than despair.  And along with hoping we can<br/>
plot one or two strategies.<br/>
<br/>
I think Mitch and Thom have the spirit -- to just replace their<br/>
boxes.  Mitch even suggested putting them right back where they<br/>
were in the hope that the little turd will tire of it, or maybe<br/>
just to show defiance.  (Or are you sure its not because you want<br/>
to hide in the bushes Mitch, and lay for the little bugger?)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a measure I thought of that may help (I may have said<br/>
this once or twice before):<br/>
<br/>
You may want to put some of your boxes in conspicuous locations:<br/>
Letterbooks indoors, or just very open, well lit places.<br/>
Some of the things thiefs and vandals deplore are openness, light,<br/>
presence of people, etc. -- anything that may prevent them from<br/>
being able to hide while they do their dirty deeds.  I'm<br/>
actually thinking of putting a letterbox in my yard under my<br/>
security light.  Its so conspicuous, I think only a true letterboxer<br/>
would go there.  Of course they do need to be well hidden, even<br/>
if they are out in the open.  Deborah and Randy surmised that <br/>
their's were lost due to not being well hidden.  But a box can be<br/>
well hidden and be conspicuous at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
I'm just thinking out loud here.... if you can think of anything else<br/>
please share...   We're certainly not licked, but I think we have<br/>
found a battle-point.  Don't you think we would do well to use a<br/>
couple of strategies to help tip the scales back if such strategies<br/>
are available and if they do not take a lot of effort?<br/>
<br/>
If there is anything else you can think of, do tell...<br/>

I think you are right in your resolve to continue on as before with <br/>
no real change in your methods or approaches. The pleasure you get <br/>
from choosing the sites that really appeal to you and writing the <br/>
clues that seem most appropriate for that box should not be <br/>
diminished one bit by worries about potential vandals. If some boxes <br/>
are lost, we just accept that and continue on. <br/>

But I'm not gonna sweat about whether my next box will come up missing, as<br/>
well.  Nor am I gonna lay in hiding for the little creep to come around again.<br/>
And I'm not going to whine about it and give up on my favorite pastime.  Life<br/>
comes and goes.  Love comes and goes.  Letterboxes come and go.  These are the<br/>
bittersweet realities that make life interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I know some of you have lost 'virgin' letterboxes that had never been found.<br/>
Your experience is is a greater shame than mine.  My letterbox had been found<br/>
six times.  That's six times that a letterboxer had the joy of making an entry<br/>
into my guest book and the opportunity to collect my hand-carved 'limited<br/>
edition' stamp.  Add to that the joy I had making it and hiding it, as well as<br/>
in going back and reading what others had left behind.  That little box was<br/>
well worth the few dollars it took to place it and the little bit of time it<br/>
took to construct.  I will happily go out and do it again... if nothing else,<br/>
just as an experiment to see how long it stays there this time.<br/>
<br/>
The other day I was riding on the new light-rail train that connects the west<br/>
side to downtown Portland.  I noticed that some punks had already scratched<br/>
graffiti onto the windows of the new train.  I was considering just how<br/>
thoughtless and inconsiderate it is for our fellow citizens deface a train<br/>
that we, the people of the city, paid for.<br/>
<br/>
But, what do we do about it?  If we catch them, of course, we punish them.<br/>
But the chances of an authority stumbling along at the precise moment that<br/>
these punks are doing their thing is about as likely as the chance that I will<br/>
stumble onto the punk who defaces letterboxes in the park in my neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, we tolerate the few society rejects as best we can, and<br/>
periodically attempt to repair the damage they do.  That's all we can do.<br/>
It's a part of life.<br/>
<br/>
It is no different in the world of letterboxing.  We can't just give up the<br/>
ship... or the train... or the letterbox... just because some thoughless jerk<br/>
messes it up.<br/>
<br/>
The letterbox will return, and the clues will remain the same.  Some of my<br/>
clues are simple, some more cryptic.  This is a decision based on making the<br/>
hobby fun for everyone.  If my clues are tough, it's cause I want you to have<br/>
the fun of thinking a bit in order to find it, not because I'm trying to<br/>
thwart the vandals.  I will NOT let n'er-do-wells stifle my creativity.<br/>
<br/>
Not only will I repace my box, but I will continue to put out many more.<br/>
Maybe if the little creep hunts down enough of my boxes, he'll realize how<br/>
much fun he's having and decide to start leaving them alone so others can<br/>
enjoy them. <br/>
<br/>
Once, when I was a teenager, I stole a book from the local library.  I didn't<br/>
really feel all that bad about doing it, either.  I didn't do it just to be<br/>
destructive... I actually read the book.  It was a good book, too.  I enjoyed<br/>
the book so much, in fact, that I started feeling bad that others would not be<br/>
able to read it, because I had taken it.  I wasn't going to read it again, so<br/>
why did I need it?  I really didn't really know why I'd taken it in the first<br/>
place.  I could have checked it out for free.  I took the book back to the<br/>
library and left it there.  I felt much better.  I found another good book AND<br/>
CHECKED IT OUT!!!  Today, instead of stealing books, I donate money to the<br/>
library so they can buy new ones.<br/>

Of the various reasons that Thom and Dan and I have listed for doing this, I<br/>
think the one that best fits how I'm feeling is defiance.  I'm bound and<br/>
determined to show the little bastard that no matter how big a turd he wants<br/>
to be, I will overcome his idiocy.  I will not let him spoil the fun that I'm<br/>
providing for others by keeping the letterbox there.  No sir, not this<br/>
Madman!!!<br/>

area, disturbed.  Wild animals have excellent senses of smell, and deer<br/>

imagine rodents and canines rooting around in the brush where a letterbox<br/>
is hidden, depending on how it is hidden, especially if it is just on<br/>
the ground covered with bark or something.<br/>
<br/>
While the response may be the same as to human vandals, there seems to be<br/>
some more preventitive measures that can be taken, such as don't reuse a<br/>
container that once contained food (its impossible to wash the smell out),<br/>
bury it under rocks, etc.  <br/>

Just a thought,<br/>

<br/>
I found some minimal damage to another box while I was out checking the<br/>
4 that are nearest to home &amp; I suspect it was caused by an animal.  2 of<br/>
my boxes (well, one for now) have "leashes" with a wood toggle handle &amp;<br/>
it is missing on the box that remains.  I think some critter gnawed on<br/>
it, possibly for the salt from hands... I took some time to carve it by<br/>
hand.<br/>
<br/>
The other two are just plain GONE!  Can't wait to get the new stamp in<br/>
place for Rock Creek #1.... commemorating a winter time visitor to our<br/>
pond.<br/>
<br/>
Mitch,  seeing as how I have an imprint of the limited edition coon's<br/>
cache... you aren't planning to do the same image all over are you?<br/>
