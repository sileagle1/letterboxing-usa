who is much taller than I and who stuffs me regularly, asked me to give a <br/>
presentation on letterboxing. Much as I love the topic, I had to decline. I'm one <br/>
of those people with a pathologic fear of public speaking. For hours before a <br/>
presentation that steel band around my chest tightens and tightens until the <br/>
frantic beating of my heart threatens to explode. My vision tunnels to a haze <br/>
of gray and my ears go underwater until I want to throw up and pass out. <br/>
Running screaming from the room is not an effective speaker's technique.<br/>
<br/>
So if anyone is willing to do a little cub scout project in southeastern CT, <br/>
please let me know and I'll pass the Toastmaster's (oops, Scoutmaster's) name <br/>
and number along.<br/>

Jay, I really think you should never speak in public again.  I'm <br/>
getting nervous for you just reading this.  It's a shame, though.  I <br/>
always enjoy what you have to say in print.  Thanks for every thing <br/>
else you do for letterboxing<br/>

Jay, I'd do it in a heartbeat if it were closer.  How far away from <br/>
Westerly RI is the location?  If you get really desperate, we can <br/>
talk.<br/>
