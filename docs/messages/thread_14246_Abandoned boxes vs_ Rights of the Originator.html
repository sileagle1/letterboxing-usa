boxes online and up to date with status information that can<br/>

to contact all previous owners of abandoned boxes in Texas and<br/>
plan to become caretaker of all that don't respond within a week<br/>

new website with all its great features.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Abandoned boxes vs. Rights of the Originator<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The creation of a new letterbox can be a very artistic undertaking on the<br/>
part<br/>
of the originator.  It provides the letterboxer with an opportunity to pair<br/>
an<br/>
artistic stamp and creative clues with a unique location.  It is a very<br/>
individual process and is part of what makes this sport so wonderful.  From<br/>
its<br/>
very beginnings one of the primary concerns of the LbNA webmasters has been<br/>
to<br/>
preserve the creative rights of the individual.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us are so caught up in the energy of this sport that the three<br/>
months<br/>
since the changeover to the database site seems like an eternity.  Others<br/>
only<br/>
check on the letterboxing site occasionally when "real life" allows them to<br/>
and<br/>
are surprised by the changes.  For the owners of many boxes, three months<br/>
can<br/>
go very quickly and they could easily take exception to having their<br/>
creative<br/>
output claimed by someone else.<br/>
<br/>
As webmasters we are caught in the quandary of wanting to preserve the<br/>
intellectual property rights of the original owner of the box, while<br/>
maintaining a point of contact to those responsible for the land where they<br/>
are<br/>
placed. <br/>
<br/>

&gt; Great idea, just ashame the webmasters will have to do most of<br/>
&gt; the work.  Maybe this will also allow "caretakers" to bring back<br/>
&gt; clues from the old web page that never made it to the new one, if<br/>
&gt; desired.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you used "if desired".  The webmasters have kicked this <br/>
around -- on the one hand its a great idea, on the other hand <br/>
some people have chosen the transition as a convienent time to <br/>
retire their listings, so it is another case of ask permission of <br/>
the clue's owner first (and IMO a different situation).<br/>
<br/>
(and I (we) really are not trying to be difficult with any of this --<br/>
its just sometimes we all see things from different angles with different<br/>
info and different experiences)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good point.  In fact, I have been wrestling with a similar<br/>
decision concerning adoption of abandoned boxes.  There are<br/>
several boxes in Texas that are abandoned but are known<br/>
missing.  Do I adopt them and edit the clues to say Missing,<br/>
or do I just have them deleted since the original owner<br/>
is long gone?  I'm tempted to keep them around since some<br/>
represent the oldest letterboxes in Texas and it<br/>
would be nice to preserve the clues for posterity.<br/>
I guess the best solution for this would be to keep the<br/>
old web site as a historical archive and delete all abandoned<br/>
boxes that are missing from the new site.  Is it<br/>
feasible to keep the old site forever or does it cost<br/>
too much or use too much resource?<br/>
