<br/>
The new Southern New England Region pages look great.  I organize my<br/>
personal clue stash in a similar manner (by town); it makes it easier to<br/>
plan multi-box outings.  I looks as though others have tried out the<br/>
links.  I, however, found a few discrepancies in the clues that I though<br/>
I'd bring to your attention.  I hope you don;t think I'm being picky<br/>
because I really appreciate the effort you and the other webmasters put<br/>
in to keep us all up to date and informed.  "The Good Earth" and "Froggy<br/>
Went a Courtin'" boxes are listed as being in Mansfield, Rhode Island<br/>
instead of Connecticut.  Also when we went looking for the "Turtle<br/>
Creek" box we noticed that the right hand turn is onto Watrous Point<br/>
Road (not Waltrons); you may want to verify this and not just take my<br/>
word.  <br/>
<br/>
On another note, I just wanted to let you know that we enjoyed your<br/>
Celestial Motion boxes at Beebe Pond.  Half of the "Elements of Hiking"<br/>
asked my daughter, Meg and I to join them in looking for these boxes. <br/>
Our little group was the first to find them.  (We were wondering whether<br/>
you were clever enough to align the location of the boxes!)  Meg and I<br/>
also got to meet Dan and Melissa and make our first exchanges.  We also<br/>
found the "Letter from a Traitor" boxes and the Avery Light box.  Look<br/>
forward to meeting you (and all) at the get together on Sunday.<br/>
