Congratulations on your F count. Hopefully you didn't remove the inside baggies. You might want to keep the box    the way you found it, at least until you get more experienced. If you mean Los Angeles, and not Louisiana when you mentioned LA, then the answer is yes there are other letterboxers around  Los Angeles. There is a regional chat list also  just for SoCal  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxing-socal <br/>
There is a northern California gathering in Sacramento on April 30, and a gathering in SoCal in the planing stages for May 22, in the LA area. I realize that you are new to letterboxing and this chat list, and I want to be as positive as possible, but some of your questions could be answered on the Newboxer chat list. I have seen your posts at that list so I know you understand how to post there. I just wish to tell you where you can go.    For information.   Also the SoCal list can help you with local letterbox information.<br/>
