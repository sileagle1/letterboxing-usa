&gt; -------------- Original message -------------- <br/>
&gt; From: "Kimberly" <martianmaggot_k9@...> <br/>
&gt; I am pulling the clues for all of my boxes, hidden throughout NJ <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; ME. My boxes were adoped by someone else, which, when asked, I said <br/>
&gt; I did not want that to happen. The clues have been altered, to give <br/>
&gt; hints to people, which I find unacceptable. If they are too <br/>
&gt; difficult for people to find, then so be it. No one should have the <br/>
&gt; right to change someone else's clues, or take over their boxes <br/>
&gt; against their express statement. I can see now how much the <br/>
&gt; letterboxing community has altered since it's inception, and it's <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; wonder why people have left. It's not all about the box. I'm <br/>
&gt; genuinely upset that someone else is claiming my effort and <br/>
&gt; creativity as their own (I read a clue that doesn't even have my <br/>
name <br/>
&gt; anywhere on it), and will not participate. <br/>

At least someone around here has some sense to at the very least wait <br/>
and see what the whole story is. <br/>
<br/>
I don't know the whole story on Kim's end, but I can at least enlighten <br/>
you as to the story on Rick's end.<br/>
<br/>
" When I adopted the Martian Maggot boxes (I should have my head<br/>
examined) I followed the following procedure:<br/>
<br/>
1) Sent mail to her many times over months with no response. I<br/>
believe she moved to Canada in 2003.<br/>
<br/>
2) Contacted Choi with a list of boxes in NJ and PA, who contacted<br/>
her at another e-mail address he had for her.<br/>
<br/>
3) Recontacted Choi later to see if he had heard from her. He changed<br/>
her LBNA clues to have my name on them. In some ways this is<br/>
hijacking because we never got explicit permission. She just doesn't<br/>
care anymore. She never responded to any more of my inquiries as to<br/>
box locations, hints on exactly where they might be hidden so that<br/>
they could be maintained, or permission to access the clues on her<br/>
letterboxing website. So I am still in the process of searching for<br/>
the boxes and replacing/repairing them.<br/>
<br/>
4) I maintain the boxes staying true to her original intent. Because<br/>
Martian Maggot also designed a special web page for most of her<br/>
clues, I have kept the clue pointing to her site. Where the clues are<br/>
wrong or out of date, I add only enough information to the LBNA page<br/>
to correct the error but not change the original clue."<br/>
<br/>
Evidentially she does care, but no one could get a hold of her to find <br/>
out one way or another.  Maybe a change in address, just being out of <br/>
the loop for a time, whatever, there was a lack of communication here <br/>
and not on Rick's part.<br/>
<br/>
Rick is a good guy.  He means no malice and in my not so humble opinion, <br/>
he did the right thing.  He spent a lot of time finding and refurbishing <br/>
her boxes.  He cared about her boxes more then his own, and never took <br/>
credit for the boxes as his own.<br/>
<br/>
As usual too many of you have jumped the gun before you had all of the <br/>
information. <br/>
<br/>
I understand why Kim is mad, what I do not understand is why she did not <br/>
first contact Rick about this, or Choi, and instead decided to pull her <br/>
clues and complain here.<br/>

<br/>
Letterboxes are artwork.  Artwork that belogs to the artist.  Period.   I'll<br/>
say it again:<br/>
<br/>
ARTWORK THAT BELONGS TO THE ARTIST.<br/>
<br/>
If the boxes were adopted with her permission, fine.  All's well with the<br/>
world.  No problem.  But just because she can't be reached, the only<br/>
possible ethical solution that I see any webmaster having any right to do is<br/>
to remove the clues from the website.  Then, when the artist contacts them<br/>
to find out why, a new email addy can be established if the webmaster<br/>
decides a current email addy is a must in order to have a box or boxes<br/>
listed.  I could even marginally understand if a webmaster wanted to put a<br/>
note at the top of the clues stating that attempts had been made<br/>
unsucessfully to contact the placer, so searchers search knowing that ahead<br/>
of time and can search "at their own risk".  But allowing someone else<br/>
access to those clues?  Never ever.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely none of the points that Rick argues that he went thru in order to<br/>
take over her boxes matters one iota.  The one and only thing that matters<br/>
is that he did not have her permission.  There was no jumping the gun, as<br/>
you say, before people had all the information, because all the information<br/>
needed was right there in her post.  There appears to be no argument on the<br/>
fact that permission from the artist was never received.  That *is* the<br/>
"whole story."<br/>
<br/>
Why should the artist contact Choi or Rick?  Rick was the one who stole her<br/>
boxes and Choi was the one who allowed it to happen.  I'm very glad it was<br/>
posted here so that other artists are aware of what happened.<br/>

<br/>
Please read the posts again, no one jumped the gun. No one mentioned<br/>
Rick in Boca until Jersytrailblazer mentioned him explaining that he<br/>
wasn't privy to all the information but stated that he was aware,<br/>
through his correspondence with Rick in Boca, that he was trying to be<br/>
helpful. Please don't turn this in to a flame as her Ladyship feels<br/>
there is an important point in all this that should be debated.<br/>
<br/>
When is a box abandoned and when does it become litter? Should there<br/>
be a rule about what is abandoned? How else would we decide when<br/>
enough time is enough. What would constitute abandonment, the last<br/>
time anyone heard from the placer, the last time someone found the<br/>
box, or merely the fact that a box is damaged in some way and the<br/>
placer hasn't checked on it quickly enough to find the damage before<br/>
someone else? It seems like that it would become a very slippery slope<br/>
to try to make a rule that imposes an expiration date on a box. It is<br/>
very likely that all letterboxers wouldn't read or accept a rule and<br/>
people inevitably will misinterpret it and next thing you know people<br/>
are 'benevolently' adopting boxes everywhere. One mustn't forget<br/>
Samuel Johnson's maxim that "Hell is paved with good intentions."<br/>
<br/>
It seems an inviolate truism that another persons art work is their<br/>
own and should never be tampered with in any way but this runs the<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; When is a box abandoned and when does it become litter? Should there<br/>

&gt; placer hasn't checked on it quickly enough to find the damage before<br/>
&gt; someone else? It seems like that it would become a very slippery <br/>
slope<br/>
&gt; to try to make a rule that imposes an expiration date on a box. It <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; very likely that all letterboxers wouldn't read or accept a rule and<br/>

The original placer put the box under a decidous tree in a busy municipal park next to the bandstand. In the Fall, once the leaves fell off, the box was completely exposed and consequently taken. Another box in that spot would have faced the same ending. After a number of attempts by letterboxers to contact the owner (letterboxers were contacting me to ask if I knew if it was really gone and telling me that the owner wasn't responding), I contacted LBNA and got permission to adopt the box. I assumed that the original intent of the placer was to bring people to the park and bandstand so I found a better spot nearby with a view of the structure. I had an image of the original stamp in my logbook so I re-carved the stamp for the new letterbox. Do people think this was the wrong thing to do? I haven't received any negative feedback from letterboxers who have found the replacement box.<br/>

          Also over the years people change services and there e-mail changes ! Maybe before they adopt a box they should post that they are looking for (so and so) planter in the lbna and atlas quest sites.If then there are no response ,try to find someone who boxes with them .But maybe there is a new definition topic. If you adopt you must leave clues as they are written .<br/>

Now you're talking. If we (pardon the phrase in light of recent talk)<br/>
"adopted" this approach I believe many of our current issues might be<br/>
resolved.  There's a reason that 1) boxes have lasted for greater<br/>
lengths of time in Dartmoor and 2) the hobby is more socially accepted<br/>
and has a great history of mystery and lore associated with it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Once it is not renewed it will be off line. This will reduce <br/>
&gt; abandoned letterboxes being listed whether they are still viable or<br/>
&gt;&gt; not and help fund LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
Ah~ hear ye hear ye~ The answer to what may be the most longstanding<br/>
issue with Americanized boxing. The clue distribution method has<br/>
resulted in a haphazard assortment of online clues. The increasing<br/>
demand for clues coupled with the increasing quantity of clues to be<br/>
listed has created a rather perplexing dilemma for both webmasters and<br/>
clue owners alike. How to fund the ongoing project, and how to create<br/>
oversight of the massive amount of boxes. Who is held liable and how<br/>
on earth can we verify whether a box is present or not? Unlike smaller<br/>
models such as the Valley Quest program that has an established track<br/>
record of "box monitors" and (the much larger) Dartmoor model which<br/>
has produced published catalogs which ensure that the box is<br/>
maintained and alive, the webpage has just become a free-for-all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How many times have we heard that folks are searching for boxes but <br/>
&gt; they are missing, whine, whine ,whine. This would also be an answer<br/>
&gt; for those missing.<br/>
&gt; Don<br/>
<br/>
Despite the appeal of a catalog, there are still not concrete<br/>
assurances that the box is present. What it does provide however is a<br/>
more established means of clue dissemination as well as a quality<br/>
control of sorts. It may not be the answer to those that whine about<br/>
things being missing because boxes can always go missing in the<br/>
meantime, but it places more responsibility on the shoulders of those<br/>
that create and publish the clues as it out to be.<br/>
<br/>
Great points Don~ <br/>

&gt; &gt; My dear Irene, her ladyship propbably would not stoop to imbibing <br/>
&gt; &gt; mere cooking sherry.  Now, some properly aged Oloroso or Palo <br/>
Cortado <br/>
&gt; &gt; would be perhaps more to her ladyship's liking.<br/>

&gt; Dearest Darling Lightnin,<br/>

&gt; Are you inviting her Ladyship over for a sherry, you handsome roue <br/>
you?<br/>
