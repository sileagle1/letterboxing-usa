&gt; Today was a great day for Letterboxing!  The Northwest was having a <br/>
wind storm (102 MPH at White Pass) but there was no rain.  Went out <br/>
to Priest Point Park to see what I could find.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about Die Hard Puget Sounder.  Going out into the land of Big <br/>
Trees in this wind!!!<br/>
<br/>
Gotta love it.<br/>
<br/>
I have Christmas Bird Count tomorrow so cannot get to Priest Point <br/>
til Sunday.  The Tree of the "Thanksgiving Dinner" is really an <br/>
amazing tree with many hole and divots that could hold a box.  My <br/>
walk and poke stick is from this tree.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The World's Crabbiest Hitch Hiker was found playing a few hands of <br/>
Nail'em.  Looking hungry, invited her along for some more Dungeness!  <br/>
Sounded like a nice thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
Especially at $2.50/ lb ( Top Foods) So good this year!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to seeing what the Nail's have made to vex me. :-D<br/>
