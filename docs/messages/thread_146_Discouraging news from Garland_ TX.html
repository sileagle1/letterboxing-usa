<br/>
I went to check boxes #3 &amp; #4 in the Duck Creek series and both were GONE.<br/>
I found bits and pieces of #3 including (eventually) the plastic box, stamp<br/>
pad and some info sheets.  Sadly the most important contents (to me) were<br/>
gone--the Log Book and the stamp I carved for that box.  #4 is completely<br/>
gone.  Totally missing.  Vanished.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not as upset about the stamps going missing as I am about the Log Books<br/>
which actually have cool stuff in them.  A couple of pages from the #3 box<br/>
book turned up in my search of the area, but they are badly damaged and<br/>
barely readable.<br/>
<br/>
Deepest of sighs.<br/>
<br/>
I can re-carve the stamps so I may...but I'm thinking I might want all my<br/>
clues off the web.  People who are interested in letterboxing can contact<br/>
me via e-mail for clues.  If #1 &amp; #2 are gone when I go check on them<br/>
tomorrow that's a definite.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly yours,<br/>

   I was very sorry to hear of the theft and vandalizing of your letterboxes.<br/>
I sincerely hope that the other two are all right. What a terrible thing....<br/>
I can hardly believe that people would waste time looking for something<br/>
like this just to destroy it.  And not just one, but double unhappiness....<br/>
   Looking for good news from you this afternoon and crossing fingers,<br/>
