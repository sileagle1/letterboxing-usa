Bethlehem, Connecticut<br/>
<br/>
Planted by Cherieph and rtrw on November 21, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty - easy to find, but following the trail may be a bit of a <br/>
challenge<br/>
Time - One to one and a half hours including stamping in<br/>
Directions to starting place - From the intersection of Routes 132<br/>
and 61, head west.  Take your first right on Munger Lane.  Shortly, <br/>
you will see a gate on your right with signs for the Bethlehem Land<br/>
Trust. If there is no room to park there, you should be able to find<br/>
a spot around the town and then walk back.<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - <br/>
According to the sign, no horses, dogs, bikes or smoking on this <br/>
trail.   <br/>
Every year the town of Bethlehem has a Christmas  Town Fair.  In 2002 <br/>
it will be December 6th and 7th.  On those days you will need to park <br/>
at the fairgrounds north of town and take the available shuttle bus <br/>
into town.<br/>
Cherieph used her head and traced the map on a piece of notebook <br/>
paper.  If you have a photographic memory, don't bother, otherwise<br/>
you will probably find it helpful in figuring out where the trails <br/>
intersect.  All you need are main trail heading north and the two <br/>
bumps on the left.  It should look like a backward capital "B". <br/>
There is a map near where you park and quite close to the cemetery, <br/>
too<br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know - <br/>
We planned this as a fun advent activity as it, basically, tells the <br/>
Christmas story.  Someone once told me the word "Bethlehem" means <br/>
house of bread in Hebrew.  A house of bread is a bakery.  Jesus is <br/>
called "the Bread of Life" in the bible.  Isn't it quite clever of<br/>
God to have the Bread of Life (one of the names in scripture for <br/>
Jesus) be born in a bakery, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  and Christmas Carols to sing as you stroll		<br/>
<br/>
Census Decree Letterbox - O little town of Bethlehem, How still we<br/>
see thee lie!  Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent stars go <br/>
by; Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting Light;  The hopes <br/>
and fears of all the years Are met in thee to-night<br/>
<br/>
In those days Caesar Augustus issued a decree that a census should be <br/>
taken of the entire Roman world.  (This was the first census that<br/>
took place while Quirinius was governor of Syria.) And everyone went <br/>
to his own town to register.  So Joseph also went up from the town of <br/>
Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because <br/>
he belonged to the house and line of David. He went there to register <br/>
with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a <br/>
child. -The Gospel of Luke, Chapter 2, verses 1-5 <br/>
<br/>
Head down the main trail which goes basically north between the stone <br/>
walls I wish were in my yard.  You will see a sign on the right for <br/>
the meadow trail followed immediately by an old cellar hole.  <br/>
Underneath the largest rock is the census decree. <br/>
Here is more info you don't need.  All our Sunday school stuff since <br/>
we were kids showed Mary riding on a donkey as she traveled the 70 <br/>
some miles from Nazareth to Bethlehem.  According to my favorite <br/>
historian, the people who were rich enough to own a donkey then would <br/>
be equivalent to people who own a Jaguar now.  Middle and lower class <br/>
folks all walked wherever they went.  For a little more detail and <br/>
Joseph's side of the story, keep reading<br/>
<br/>
This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was <br/>
pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she <br/>
was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.  Because Joseph<br/>
her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to <br/>
public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.   But after<br/>
he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a <br/>
dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary <br/>
home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy <br/>
Spirit.  She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the <br/>
name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins." All<br/>
this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:<br/>
"The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they <br/>
will call him Immanuel"--which means, "God with us."   When Joseph <br/>
woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took <br/>
Mary home as his wife.  But he had no union with her until she gave <br/>
birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus. - The Gospel of <br/>
Matthew, Chapter 1, verses 18-25<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No Room at the Inn Letterbox - Away in a manger, no crib for a bed, <br/>
The little Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head. The stars in the <br/>
bright sky looked down where he lay, The little Lord Jesus asleep on <br/>
the hay<br/>
<br/>
While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, and she <br/>
gave birth to her first born, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and <br/>
placed him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the<br/>
inn. - The Gospel of Luke, Chapter 2, verses 6 and 7<br/>
<br/>
Tuck the decree back in place and continue in the same direction down <br/>
the trail for a few minutes.  You will pass a small stream on your <br/>
right and soon come to a clump of hemlocks followed by some sawn<br/>
logs, dinner plate size, on your right, as well.  On the other side<br/>
of the trail there is a breach/opening in the stone wall.  Stand on <br/>
the right side of the breach close to the stone wall.  Take a sharp <br/>
right and one giant step.  No Room at the Inn is tucked away by your <br/>
foot.  Please, always be very gentle with, and respectful of old stone<br/>
walls. They are not only historically valuable, they are hard to <br/>
create.  OK, lecture on stone walls is over.  <br/>
Interestingly (probably only to me), this stamp is the one that made <br/>
me fall in love with carving.  Back to our story and more<br/>
interesting, yet fairly useless info.  Mangers are feeding troughs<br/>
for animals and in Israel they are made of stone, not wood.   Also, <br/>
the "stable" where Jesus was born was probably more like a cave than <br/>
any barn we know.  Not much wood in Israel, but there are plenty of<br/>
caves. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do Not Be Afraid Letterbox - Hark! the herald angels sing Glory to<br/>
the new-born King!  Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners <br/>
reconciled! Joyful, all ye nations, rise, Join the triumph of the <br/>
skies; With th' angelic host proclaim  Christ is born in Bethlehem! <br/>
Hark! the herald angels sing Glory to the newborn King<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping <br/>
watch over their flocks at night.  An angel of the Lord appeared to <br/>
them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were <br/>
terrified.  But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid. I bring<br/>
you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.  Today in <br/>
the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is Christ the <br/>
Lord.  This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in <br/>
cloths and lying in a manger."   Suddenly a great company of the <br/>
heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying,<br/>
"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men on whom his <br/>
favor rests." The Gospel of Luke, Chapter 2, verses 8 - 14<br/>
<br/>
Keep on going until you reach the wonderful old cemetery at the edge <br/>
of the preserve.  Great stones, including Joseph Bellamy and Sarah <br/>
Hillhouse Bellamy.  Joseph was a student of the great Connecticut <br/>
preacher, Jonathan Edwards, and the first minister in Bethlehem.  I <br/>
think it's interesting that Sarah had a lovely flower and bud over<br/>
her name on their mutual stone while Joseph has nothing.  According<br/>
to a web site I found, Joseph had the first theology school in our <br/>
country in his home.  OK, more clues, fewer obscure observations.  <br/>
Head to the southwest corner of the cemetery, passing the unique<br/>
stone of Katherine Paisley Brown.  In a cedar near the corner is Do <br/>
Not Be Afraid.  <br/>
<br/>
Spread the Word Letterbox - Go, tell it on the mountain,Over the<br/>
hills and everywhereGo, tell it on the mountain,That Jesus Christ is <br/>
born.  While shepherds kept their watching Over silent flocks by night<br/>
Behold throughout the heavens There shone a holy light.<br/>
<br/>
When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds<br/>
said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see this thing that <br/>
has happened, which the Lord has told us about."   So they hurried<br/>
off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the <br/>
manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what <br/>
had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed <br/>
at what the shepherds said to them.  But Mary treasured up all these <br/>
things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, <br/>
glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and <br/>
seen, which were just as they had been told.  <br/>
The Gospel of Luke, Chapter 2, verses 15 - 20<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail from whence you came.  If you didn't follow our <br/>
initial advice about the map, take another look now because you will <br/>
need it.  As you head down the path, take your first right on a trail <br/>
to the southwest.  After a large bend to the left you stroll through<br/>
a grassy pricker area.  Some conifers (seems like Christmas trees <br/>
would be appropriate) are guarding stone wall on both sides of the <br/>
trail.  There's a downed tree just in front of the wall on the right. <br/>
At its base is Spread the Word.  <br/>
Trivia time!  The shepherds were most likely not a bunch of old guys, <br/>
but boys who were teenagers and younger.  Shepherding was typically <br/>
kid stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Follow the Star Letterbox - We three kings of Orient are; Bearing <br/>
gifts we traverse afar, Field and fountain, moor and mountain, <br/>
Following yonder star.   O star of wonder, star of light, Star with <br/>
royal beauty bright,Westward leading, still proceeding, Guide us to <br/>
thy perfect light.<br/>
<br/>
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King <br/>
Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked, "Where is the <br/>
one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the<br/>
east and have come to worship him."  When King Herod heard this he<br/>
was disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him.   When he had called <br/>
together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law, he <br/>
asked them where the Christ was to be born.  "In Bethlehem in Judea," <br/>
they replied, "for this is what the prophet has written: " 'But you, <br/>
Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the <br/>
rulers of Judah; for out of you will come a ruler who will be the <br/>
shepherd of my people Israel.'"   Then Herod called the Magi secretly <br/>
and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.  He<br/>
sent them to Bethlehem and said, "Go and make a careful search for<br/>
the child. As soon as you find him, report to me, so that I too may go<br/>
and worship him."  After they had heard the king, they went on their <br/>
way, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until <br/>
it stopped over the place where the child was.  When they saw the <br/>
star, they were overjoyed.  On coming to the house, they saw the<br/>
child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. <br/>
Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold <br/>
and of incense and of myrrh. -The Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 2,<br/>
verses 1-11<br/>
<br/>
Once regaining the main trail by the stone walls and fence posts,<br/>
make a right turn onto a trail with a few small white markers telling <br/>
you what kind of trees you are looking for.  There are only a few, but<br/>
the one that is of most interest to you is the pignut hickory on the <br/>
right.  On the left side of the trail you should see a fallen tree.  <br/>
In the root end is Follow the Star.  And we are dying to know what a <br/>
pignut looks like.<br/>
King Herod was a gifted architect/builder.  He rebuilt the temple in <br/>
Jerusalem, and many palaces for himself around Israel including the <br/>
now famous fortress at Masada.  He used no slave labor, but rather <br/>
paid his workers and craftsmen well.  Herodian, the palace he named <br/>
for himself, is just outside Bethlehem and you can walk around in the <br/>
remains to this day.  It has a huge 12 foot deep swimming pool at<br/>
the bottom of the hill that was 230x150 feet.  This isn't terribly <br/>
impressive until you learn that it's virtually desert conditions.  <br/>
Herod was great with water supply.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wise Guys Letterbox - Your time is short.  Sing all the rest of the <br/>
carols you can think of.  Silent night, joy to the world, angels we <br/>
have heard on high,  O come, all ye faithful<br/>
<br/>
And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they <br/>
returned to their country by another route. When they had gone, an <br/>
angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up," he said, <br/>
"take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until<br/>
I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."  <br/>
So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left <br/>
for Egypt,  where  he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was <br/>
fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: "Out of Egypt I <br/>
called my son."  When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by<br/>
the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in <br/>
Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in <br/>
accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.<br/>
-The Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 2, verse 12-16<br/>
<br/>
When you arrive at a junction in the trail at a medium sized hemlock, <br/>
turn left.  In the winter you will be able to see some tan buildings <br/>
across the road.  You will pass a labeled sugar maple and then go<br/>
down a slight slope to a pile of cut logs.  The Wise Guys are hiding <br/>
out there.  Perhaps this is the route they took to get home?  Keep on <br/>
going down the trail and you will be back to the cellar hole.  Turn <br/>
right and head back to you vehicle<br/>
These comments aren't for kids - <br/>
Herod was a major sicko.  Killed the little boys in Bethlehem and <br/>
murdered many of his own family including a wife he loved for <br/>
absolutely no good reason.  When he knew he was going to die, he had <br/>
his troops round up many leaders in Israel and lock them up.  I could <br/>
be wrong, but I think it was thousands.  He ordered his army to kill <br/>
them all once he died.  He knew no one would mourn him, but he was <br/>
going to make sure there was mourning occurring at the time of his <br/>
death.   Can you imagine someone as paranoid as King Herod hearing <br/>
someone say they were looking for the newborn king of the Jews? We<br/>
are very glad the Magi went home by another route.  Oh yes, nowhere<br/>
in scripture does it say there were three kings, wise men or magi, and<br/>
we don't know any of their names.  <br/>
