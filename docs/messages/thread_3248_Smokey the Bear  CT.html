&gt;Let me add my appreciation to Bill and Val and to Amy, especially for<br/>
&gt;planting those boxes so close to my home! On Sunday afternoon, the Crew from<br/>
&gt;Collinsville (the CT branch, not the IL branch!) - consisting of my friends<br/>
&gt;David and Sarah, their kids Rebekah (a/k/a Tiki) and Josh (the Squash), and<br/>
&gt;me - were the second group to lay claim to these letterboxes. As new as these<br/>
&gt;boxes are, I just had that funny feeling that we wouldn't be the first ones<br/>
&gt;to find them. Sure enough, I was right: when I saw that ESAK had stamped in<br/>
&gt;right before us at each of the five letterboxes, I smiled and nodded<br/>
&gt;knowingly. (Both ESAK and the Crew from Collinsville live one town away from<br/>
&gt;Sessions Woods, but in opposite directions.) One benefit, however, of<br/>
&gt;stamping in after ESAK was getting to see their brand new, personal<br/>
&gt;letterboxing stamp; it is most attractive and very colorful! Definitely one<br/>
&gt;of the nicest I've seen on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
We had every intention of also seeking those boxes out on the very same <br/>
Sunday. My son was participating in a soccer tournament in Farmington all <br/>
weekend. His Sunday schedule had a game at noon, leaving us a few hours to <br/>
letterbox at nearby Sessions Woods. Alas, Matthew was too tired after his <br/>
game, and it went long anyway, so we decided against it. However, his team <br/>
won that game and qualified for the semi-finals on Monday morning. Sad to <br/>
say, they lost the Monday morning game, but it left us another chance at <br/>
Sessions Woods. This time we made it. We also found all 5 boxes and the <br/>
kids thoroughly enjoyed the Smokey the Bear box at the Summer House. It was <br/>
an active day for hikers too, so we had to wait around, being discreet, <br/>
especially at the Tower, where cars passed us on the way there! On the <br/>
trail! What a freak out that was. Turns out they were Scouts doing some <br/>
work on the Tower.<br/>
<br/>
What a beautiful WMA too. We have several of them in eastern CT but none <br/>
I've been to were as well laid out as this one. We loved the Boardwalk, <br/>
although when the kids realized what the blind at the end of it was for, <br/>
they weren't too happy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the great series, Bill and Val, and Alan is right, the new stamp <br/>
for ESAK is cool.<br/>
