afterwards stopped by the Magic Hedge letterbox, only to discover the<br/>
tupperware laying out on the trail, the logbook and stamp completely<br/>
missing. Someone had left a note who was also at the Sierra Club beach<br/>
cleanup that very morning, so how long ago was the letterbox vandalized?<br/>
<br/>
More and more this area has been giving me the creeps (and I've seen a<br/>
lot of creepy places!), with random people wandering aimlessly through<br/>
the woods without apparent purpose. It makes me hesitant about<br/>
replacing the box, even though its in an ideal location. <br/>
<br/>
This is the third box to be stolen or vandalized in Chicago this<br/>
summer. I'm feeling pretty discouraged about urban letterboxing right<br/>
now. I really spent a lot of time trying to find locations where<br/>
nothing would be discovered by accident, so maybe I'd just trusted in<br/>
my own cleverness too much. Arg! Now I have to find a new hiding place<br/>
for this one too! <br/>
