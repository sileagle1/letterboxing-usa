<br/>
So glad to see a letterbox in Newport.  If you hunt this box,<br/>
take some time to explore the town, it is certainly worth the<br/>
trip.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, managed to get some time in Exeter RI, on Monday before an<br/>
otherwise boring business trip to hunt for the Feather in the <br/>
Cap series, and am happy to report that all the boxes were still <br/>
there (although the first 2 could use an internal ziploc or better <br/>
waterproofing, IMO).  This is my second visit to this place, and<br/>
if you've never been there, I highly recommend it, it is <br/>
absolutely beautiful.  Take heed of the times given in the clue <br/>
though, I ran the flat and downhill trails and it still took me <br/>
almost four hours; bring a mountain bike if you have one ... or<br/>
spend less time searching for the spot the box is hidden :-)  (Also,<br/>
the Breakheart box is in that park, and that's a long one too --<br/>
the challenge is to find all 5 with a minimum of hiking ...)<br/>
<br/>
Then, when a sane person would have headed to the otherwise boring<br/>
business hotel, I decided to cruise up to Quabbin for some more <br/>
trail running and speed letterboxing, and despite spending a good<br/>
half hour wandering through seemingly shoulder-high ferns being<br/>
totally off-base, I managed to locate the Moon and Stars box and<br/>
the Salamander box, and get back before the "hour after sunset"<br/>
closing of the place.  Another beautiful place, which, unfortunately,<br/>
I did not have more time to explore further.<br/>
<br/>
My original plan was to then go to Sheiling Forest and try to get<br/>
letterboxes in three states in one day, but it was not to be, mainly<br/>
due to USAir delays in excess of an hour on a flight that had a<br/>
flight time of 39 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, thanks Drewclan and Bonnie :-)<br/>
