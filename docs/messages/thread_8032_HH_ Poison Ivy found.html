I would be sooooo very happy if it travelled out to the Pacific NW. <br/>
It was picked up in Maryland sometime the second week of Sept. If it <br/>
is mine HOW COOL!! Please email me to let me know some history and <br/>
possibly where it is headed. Don't post to talk list, I like people <br/>
to be surprised. <br/>
    Never thought I EVER would be happy about poison ivy!<br/>
