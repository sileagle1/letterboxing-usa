I've gotten some off-list messages asking about letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to clarify that I'm not a webmaster, so I dunno, except to<br/>
say that that websites go down, and that the problem is most likely <br/>
temporary.  Simple diagnostics indicate that no web server is listening <br/>
on port 80 of where letterboxing.org is pointing to, but that that machine <br/>
is running.  This could indicate one of several totally different kinds<br/>
of problems.  9 times out of 10, these problems are corrected within 24 hour<br/>
kinds of timeframes unless malice is the cause (which it usually is not).<br/>
I'm too busy to dig deeper than that right now.  I'm sure the webmasters<br/>
will, but remember, most if not all of them have day jobs and manage<br/>
the web site in their spare time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as many people host their clues on their own webspace (as opposed to<br/>
on the letterboxing.org server), so use a search engine to try to find clues,<br/>
and you may get lucky in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Randy used to track how many times we were attacked and it was really <br/>

Anyway, we seem to be back up...<br/>

I've kept count since the last time-out (it's a letterboxing thing, <br/>
PFXES, now "D"), and yahoogroups have been "database unavailable" <br/>
seven times for me since LbNA last went down. I guess that might mean <br/>
we're getting decent service...<br/>
