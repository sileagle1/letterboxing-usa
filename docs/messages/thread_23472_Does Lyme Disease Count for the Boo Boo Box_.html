It was just confirmed by a blood test, I have LD. My guess is I <br/>
contracted it in early May while letterboxing in Borderlands State <br/>
Park in Sharon, MA. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LMAO--I've just contracted Lyme Disease (LD), too!!!  I picked two deer <br/>
ticks out of my hide after finding a couple of 'boxes the week before <br/>
Memorial Day.  <br/>
The bullseye rash appeared about a week after I pulled the blood-<br/>
sucking little arachnids off me.  Blood work isn't back yet (saw the <br/>
Dr. yesterday) but he was as confident as was I that it is LD.  I <br/>
started Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 3 weeks yesterday. :p  Glad <br/>
I recognised the rash and caught it early; hope you did too.  LD can be <br/>
one nasty bug...  Let's hope for the best.<br/>
