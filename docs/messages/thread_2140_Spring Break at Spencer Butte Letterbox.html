Eugene area.  Thought maybe I was going to have to go down there and <br/>
do it myself!! :-)<br/>

Nice job, Sue. I'm looking forward to hunting for your letterbox next <br/>
time I'm in Eugene!!<br/>

&gt; planted by Floater and Sprout<br/>
&gt; March 28 2001<br/>
&gt; at Spencer Butte Park,Eugene,Oregon,Lane County<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; follow Willamette St. outside of town to the parks sign on the left<br/>
&gt; at the trail map take the blue summit trail starting to the right<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Don't let the first sign scare you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next sign will point you toward SpencerButte Summit 1.0 mile.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In this college town, make sure your grammar is correct, according <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the next sign.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Following the free spirit of Eugene pick your own path to scramble <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; the top  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Find the blue post marker with a hiker sign<br/>
&gt; go 35 paces back down the trail<br/>
&gt; On 200 degrees go 15 paces to the base of a lone old pine tree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; we turned around here and went back the same way.do not follow the <br/>
trail<br/>
&gt; beyond the blue hiker sign-it will take you back to another parking <br/>
lot.<br/>
&gt; Time: 2 hours<br/>
