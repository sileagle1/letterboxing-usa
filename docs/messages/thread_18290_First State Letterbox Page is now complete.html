<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that I have finished what we have <br/>
discussed several weeks ago - a place to preserve an important part <br/>
of our letterboxing history - the first letterbox in each of the 50 <br/>
states. <br/>
<br/>
I have assembled all of the info from numerous emails and thanks to <br/>
Silent Doug who found an old Mapsurfer achived file somewhere out <br/>
there in the dusty part of the internet! Thanks Doug.<br/>
<br/>
Initially we had bantered about the idea of putting first finders <br/>
names in. I heard from a respected member of the letterboxing <br/>
community and a good friend who advised that this feature might <br/>
lessen the importance of the first boxes and make it more like a <br/>
competition. This was totally against the historical aspect of which <br/>
we were trying to achieve so I dropped that feature from the page.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to let me know if you have visited a box and can <br/>
give a newer status report than is shown, if any. Also, let me know <br/>
any corrections or additions that may need to be made. I would like <br/>
to see this page as complete as possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for your help.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
