<br/>
Remember, this box is for only those people who have saved a box from grave danger.  (refreshing a box for an owner does NOT apply!)<br/>
<br/>
In order to sign up for this PLB, you need to go to atlasquest and send me an e-mail there.  Send me the story on atlasquest and I will let you know if you should sign up.  Once I get between 10-20 signups, I'll send the box out.<br/>
<br/>
For those who don't know what atlasquest is, go to atlasquest.com!  It's a GREAT website where you can track your finds!  I love it!  Join and put your boxes on their site!<br/>
