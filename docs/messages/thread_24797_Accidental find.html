First, I hope you didn't remove it from its location . . . apparently<br/>
a good one for it to still be there!<br/>
<br/>
Did the logbook identify who placed it??  Trail name and/or e-ddress.<br/>
<br/>
It could have been a Word of Mouth clue that was never intended to be<br/>
placed on the internet.  Did the log book show when it was planted?<br/>
<br/>
Amanda from Seattle has it posted as a find back on March 12 2002 --<br/>
don't know if she can offer up an insight as to who planted it.  She<br/>
posted message 61709 - you can go to that message and click on the<br/>
envelope to contact her.<br/>
