                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree concerning your "Dad" comments. We have a very outdoors-y one <br/>
and I think he may be more of a geocache guy. (And I refer to him as <br/>
Papa Fugit (rhymes with "hug it" in his case). But he's happy to see <br/>
his kids outdoors and he will help us place our first permanent box. <br/>
Be prepared to rappel [joking, I think!].<br/>

Peace, <br/>
