boxes this weekend, both of which had weathered the recent storms <br/>
wonderfully -- one had been visited, the other had not.  But I didn't <br/>

dune (Note to self...  don't put boxes in locations that you don't <br/>
want to have to go back to).<br/>

I received an e-mail today from somebody who had went hunting for <br/>
Seagull Shadows this weekend and wasn't able to find it...  Just <br/>
wondering if anyone had been there (perhaps the people who had been <br/>
earlier to Spirit of the Dunes?) and could possibly save me the dune <br/>
climb to verify if it is okay or missing.<br/>

Really, I'm not lazy -- just would rather devote my hiking time to <br/>
scouting out new locations ;-)<br/>
