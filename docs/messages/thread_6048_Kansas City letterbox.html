kids the frist time "treasure hunting", thier little legs had a hard <br/>
time staying cought up with me but they enjoyed it very much. They <br/>
were very excited to find a real treasure when we found the frist <br/>
box. I am sorry they would not leave it, the frog and the baby <br/>
ladybug have found a new home. But we did leave a little bag of <br/>
goodies for the next person to have. The next box was a very easy <br/>
find. I have lived here for 18 years and never knew that the bears <br/>
were even there. Of coure I forgot my pen so I lift my business card <br/>
and I staped the book. I made sure the stamp was put back in the <br/>
place was found.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the great find.<br/>

PS. There is a family of baby bunnies that live where the first box <br/>
is hide. My son age 4 tried to catch one to put in your box. lol it <br/>
was very funny sight to see.  <br/>
