Tualatin Hills Nature Park Series<br/>
<br/>
Located on Millikan Blvd near Murray Blvd and TV Hwy in Beaverton.  This<br/>
Nature Park is a 22 acre nature preserve with several ecosystems.  A<br/>
variety of wildlife exist here in the middle of a busy suburban<br/>
neighborhood.  This series is family friendly and two of the boxes could<br/>
potentially be handicap accessible.<br/>
<br/>
The letterboxes feature wildlife you might see within the Park.  You<br/>
will need a Park Map (available in or out in front of the Interp.Ctr) to<br/>
find trails easily.  All of the letterboxes are located within one or<br/>
two steps of the trail.  Please remain on the marked trails.  Remember<br/>
to replace the letterboxes as you found them with lids tight and all<br/>
contents within the ziploc bags provided.  Good luck &amp; happy<br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
All directions begin at the Interpretive Center<br/>
<br/>
Box 1<br/>
<br/>
I am a fish, small and wary.  Colorful and prized by anglers.  I like<br/>
warm water best.  To find my letterbox you wont have to swim!  Travel<br/>
down the Oak Trail.  If you think you need a rest, sit awhile.  You are<br/>
very near my hiding place.  10 more steps and you will see a decomposing<br/>
stump on the left side of the trail.  Reach behind the stump and grab me<br/>
by the tail!<br/>
<br/>
terrain: paved path  	difficulty: easy <br/>
<br/>
Box 2<br/>
<br/>
I am furry with good ears and eyes.  Some say my feet are lucky.  To<br/>
find me you will hop along the Oak Trail past box 1.  When you get to<br/>
the long boardwalk, turn around and make 15 hops back up the trail.  I<br/>
am hiding down low.  You might see one of the predators I hide from<br/>
etched in stone.  (note: stinging nettle alert!!)<br/>
<br/>
terrain: paved path	   difficulty: easy<br/>
<br/>
Box 3 <br/>
<br/>
I slither along the sunny paths.  I have no legs, yet I move very fast<br/>
to stay out from under your boots!  To find me, walk along the Creek<br/>
Trail.  25 paces west of the reed forest you may see some of my kind<br/>
resting in the pockets of this snake condominium.  It looks like a<br/>
giant fan with lots of hiding places.  Look down low and you will find<br/>
me.  Please take extra care when replacing this box as it is is very<br/>
near the trail and could easily be seen and taken.<br/>
<br/>
terrain: dirt path	   difficulty: moderately easy<br/>
<br/>
Box 4<br/>
<br/>
I fish from above.  I am small but noisy.  I share the Big Pond with<br/>
herons, nutria, ducks and frogs.  From the Vine Maple Trail, turn onto<br/>
the Big Fir Trail.  Turn left onto the Trillium Loop.  50 big paces<br/>
after the trail curves around a big stump, you will see 5 maple trees<br/>
with one skinny pine whispering secrets to them.  They have a good view<br/>
of the marsh.  Box 4 is hidden in the roots.  If you see the Big Pond<br/>
you have gone too far.<br/>
<br/>
terrain: dirt path	    difficulty: observant letterboxing required!<br/>
