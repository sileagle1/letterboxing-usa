Hi!<br/>
I'm the Director of Education at Dorris Ranch Living History Farm in <br/>
Springfield, OR. We found your letterbox on our property and its <br/>
location is interfering with our school tours. I'm not part of this <br/>
game, although it sounds interesting and I may someday take my son <br/>
out to do it, but for now I need someone to come and get this box and <br/>
take it away. Whom do I contact to do this? <br/>
Thank you for your prompt attention,<br/>

So.. um.. is anyone doing anything about this?  This lady seems very nice and it would be a <br/>
shame if no one contacted the placers and made sure they saw her message.  It's clear that <br/>
it is one of the three boxes placed by the family o foxes girl scout troop, since they're the <br/>
only ones in the database placed at  Dorris Ranch.<br/>
