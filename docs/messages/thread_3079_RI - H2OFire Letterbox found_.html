H2OFire Letterbox before a wonderful dinner.  The box was in good <br/>
condition, though surrounded by quite a bit of trash that makes me <br/>
think it might be discovered soon if groundskeepers take any pains at <br/>
all to clean up the area.<br/>
<br/>
Very clever clues to this letterbox!  It was actually our 2nd attempt <br/>
at finding it: We were cocky and figured that since we knew <br/>
Providence quite well we thought that we knew exactly where it was <br/>
when we read the clues, rather than actually following the clues as <br/>
written.  Well, we were nowhere near the box on our first try before <br/>
it started getting dark, so we returned, humbled, followed the clues <br/>
as written, and found it easily.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Chip!<br/>
