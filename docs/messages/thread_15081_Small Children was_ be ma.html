I so want to hear aobut boxing with small ones.  What type of backpack do<br/>
you use?  I am thinking about getting one.<br/>
<br/>
Do you all use a family stamp or individuals?  I am considering a combo.  I<br/>
have a gorgeous new personal stamp (Thank you Scout Dog) that I will use<br/>
and may also purchse small ones for hte kdis.  I don't wnat to clutterup<br/>
anyone's log tho.  What is "kosher"?<br/>
<br/>
Have an excitign trip planned for the weekend--might net us 4 boxes.    Will<br/>
share my adventures as they develop!<br/>

Honestly I don't know what it's called.  We got it from a friend who <br/>
was moving away &amp; trying to clean house.  My son has a stamp &amp; his <br/>
own journal but the baby doesn't.  Once she's old enough to <br/>
participate we'll probably make one for her.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun this weekend.  We'll hoping to join some friend to search <br/>
for a couple of boxes as well.  Happy hunting!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">mind if I butt in too? My daughter is nearly 19 months old too. I've taken her on most <br/>
of LB hunts. She's usually in the stroller or she's napping in the car (with dad on watch <br/>
) while I run out to stamp in the box. The one time I went without her turned out to <br/>
be a really good idea. The trail went up a very rocky and steep slope and it had to be <br/>
at least 90 degrees out in the sun. I haven't made a stamp for her but sometimes I <br/>
write her name in the log book.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a backpack for her but now that she's over 25 lbs. it's getting pretty awkward. <br/>
I'm sure it won't be long before she's running way ahead of me on the trail and I hear <br/>
her calling out "I found it!"<br/>

My partner and I letterbox with a 12 yr. old and a 3 yr. old. While <br/>
the 12 yr. old does pretty good most of the time (sometimes she <br/>
whines about being tired.), the 3 yr. old is now being referred to <br/>
as "TrailSnail". LOL  She's either lagging behind or running too far <br/>
ahead and we have to tell her to slow down. She's fallen about a <br/>
dozen times now, and her poor little legs have little scratches and <br/>
bruises all over them. But she has her own stamp and journal and she <br/>
always wants to "do it herself" when it comes time to stamp in. I <br/>
think we'll make a true letterboxer (and hiker) outta her yet. :)<br/>

&gt; Trail Snail sounds like a great trail name for her. My son gave me my trail name when he was 9. We were climbing Mt. Monadnock, NH and he climbed to the top 3 times will I took my time with the one Assent. He's now 20 and I still proudly go by this name.<br/>

i have a 2.5 year old that i take with me when i can.  but there was <br/>
a question regarding backpacks...we have a great one that is made by <br/>
Kelty.  if you live in cinci, and if you don't, we bought ours at <br/>
bass pro. it's the Kelty Town carrier. there's a Country one as <br/>
well, but it was rather bulky and made to carry a child for lengthy <br/>
periods.  we use it for festivals and hiking and the like. both are <br/>
for kids up to 50 pounds.  very sturdy and safe.<br/>
<br/>
just my input....and it appears that there are several family groups <br/>
in cinci...i wasn't aware of this.  cool!<br/>
