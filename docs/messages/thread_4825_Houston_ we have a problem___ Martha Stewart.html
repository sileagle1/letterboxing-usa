<p>     About a month ago, I was contacted by a woman named Martha in response to a recruitment teaser I'd left on the bulletin board at the local library (see attachment). She was pleasant enough, and I explained the game to her, gave her a few of my clues, and directed her here. Since then, she's torn through my boxes at a rate that would make Wanda and Pete dizzy. Just about every night, for the last two weeks, I've gotten a note from her, detailing her day's 'boxing adventure. </p>
<p>     Little did I know, it was <em>the Martha</em>. Yes, Martha Stewart. She lives here, at least part of the time. We all see her on occasion. So, that's exciting, right? It would be fun to have a celebrity in our midst. But there's one hitch, and this is how I found out it was <em>the Martha</em>: She wants to do a show on letterboxing. She loves my boxes, and wants me to appear. I was appalled. You see, Martha has an uncanny way of finding all the good, local secret spots. Places few tourists find. Then she uses them as fodder for her lifestyle show, and guess who's lifestyle suffers? She's ruined this place with her exposure. <em>Now she's found letterboxing.</em> </p>
<p>     Don't get me wrong. I'm all for new players. After all, it was my recruitment notice that led her in the door. But there's much to be said for gradual growth. We are not ready to see a thousandfold increase in 'boxers! The price of Rubbermaid and erasers will skyrocket due to the new demand... that is, if you'll even be able to find them. The webmasters can barely keep up with the postings now. How will they cope with the surge? I tried to explain this to her, and begged her to keep this one for herself. She got kind of huffy... said she owed it to people to let them know about our fun game, so they could participate, too. (That's when I told her to keep the hell out of my boxes). Anyway, I'm thinking of pulling my boxes, or at least reconfiguring them to make them by invitation only. I know I couldn't keep up with hundreds of people going through them a year. And what about the 'boxing hooligans sure to follow? Dartmoor's got 'em. They'll emerge here, too, once we're exposed, and no publicly listed clue will be safe from them. We'll pine for the days when the worst we had to worry about was the red-tongued hitchhikernapper. </p>
<p>     What can we do? Well, I know for a fact that Martha's lurking in the background of these pages. She's probably read this message before most of you will. Maybe, if we collectively scream <strong>STOP!</strong> loudly enough, we can avert this holocaust. <strong><em>Please</em>, post your disapproval.</strong> </p>

much publicity.  I think word of mouth is the way to go.  I am <br/>

showing them how to make rubber stamps...but Girls Scouts in the <br/>
woods are good .... hords of humanity in the woods is awful....<br/>
<br/>
we have enough problems already with vandalism &amp; I know some areas <br/>
are removing letterboxes from their lands .. they don't want them <br/>
there.  I can't image what will happen if it gets on National TV.  <br/>
Not to mention that hiking in the woods can be dangerous if you go <br/>
unprepared.   So my message is to anyone contacted about <br/>

<div>Hi!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    RE:  MARTHA STEWART  I couldn't 
agree more!!!!  Why does something that is such a great activity have to be 
made into a commercial venture for Martha?  She will exploit it by making 
Martha Stewart letterboxing kits that will sell for a fancy price!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    It is fun to figure out the clues and the 
mystery boxes, and is not something that everyone would enjoy, just because it 
is put on her Lifestyle Program.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    Why don't we send her on the quest of 
climbing all the 453 mountains in New England that are over 3,000 feet to find 
the register jars on little known peaks by using map and compass?  
After she gets scratched up and bruised, then will she commercialize that quest, 
too?</div>

<br/>
I AGREE - WE ARE SCREWED!!  I AM SURE MARTHA SEE'S A DEFINITE COMMERCIAL<br/>
VENTURE IN THIS SOMEWHERE (pre made letterboxing kits with exacto knife,<br/>
stamp pad, carving medium.....)  Well, really, what did everyone expect to<br/>
happen when there was no secrecy involved anymore?  We have not been covert<br/>
enough in our actions - too many people know about this game.  Also, rather<br/>
than taking the time to have a nice walk in the woods, and eventually<br/>
getting to the "treasure box" - more often than not - newbies are racing to<br/>
find boxes to increase their found/placed count.  Sort of defeating the<br/>
purpose  of the whole experience I think.  WHAT A CRYING SHAME!!!!   This<br/>
game is spoiled for sure!!  Too many people tromping through the woods as<br/>
it is now!  Why does everyone feel the need to broadcast this hobby?  My<br/>
son and I found out about letterboxing 3 or 4 years ago from a 4 line blurb<br/>
in Smithsonian magazine.  We gleefully set off on our boxing adventures,<br/>
and have rarely shared our secret with people.  That may sound selfish -<br/>
but at least the game was more contained then.  Now, we can't even open a<br/>
local newspaper without running into an article on boxing.  WE ARE DONE<br/>
FOR!  Martha please, you have multi millions - do you really need to<br/>
increase your wealth yet again by commercializing a  hundred year old<br/>
hobby?  PLEASE LEAVE US ALONE!!! I am totally bummed by this whole deal.<br/>
And Leger de maine - WHAT WERE YOU  THINKING? Posting a recruitment poster<br/>
at the library?  I am sorry - but did you not think maybe the information<br/>
might fall into the wrong hands?  Let alone the local Audubon society that<br/>
lives for removing boxes from their property.  YIPES -  this is really a<br/>
sad state of affairs for sure.<br/>

<p>     About a month ago, I was contacted by a woman 
  named Martha in response to a recruitment teaser I'd left on the bulletin 
  board at the local library (see attachment). She was pleasant enough, and I 
  explained the game to her, gave her a few of my clues, and directed her here. 
  Since then, she's torn through my boxes at a rate that would make Wanda and 
  Pete dizzy. Just about every night, for the last two weeks, I've gotten a note 
  from her, detailing her day's 'boxing adventure. </p>
<p>     Little did I know, it was <em>the Martha</em>. 
  Yes, Martha Stewart. She lives here, at least part of the time. We all see her 
  on occasion. So, that's exciting, right? It would be fun to have a celebrity 
  in our midst. But there's one hitch, and this is how I found out it was 
  <em>the Martha</em>: She wants to do a show on letterboxing. She loves my 
  boxes, and wants me to appear. I was appalled. You see, Martha has an uncanny 
  way of finding all the good, local secret spots. Places few tourists find. 
  Then she uses them as fodder for her lifestyle show, and guess who's lifestyle 
  suffers? She's ruined this place with her exposure. <em>Now she's found 
  letterboxing.</em> </p>
<p>     Don't get me wrong. I'm all for new players. After 
  all, it was my recruitment notice that led her in the door. But there's much 
  to be said for gradual growth. We are not ready to see a thousandfold increase 
  in 'boxers! The price of Rubbermaid and erasers will skyrocket due to the new 
  demand... that is, if you'll even be able to find them. The webmasters can 
  barely keep up with the postings now. How will they cope with the surge? I 
  tried to explain this to her, and begged her to keep this one for herself. She 
  got kind of huffy... said she owed it to people to let them know about our fun 
  game, so they could participate, too. (That's when I told her to keep the hell 
  out of my boxes). Anyway, I'm thinking of pulling my boxes, or at least 
  reconfiguring them to make them by invitation only. I know I couldn't keep up 
  with hundreds of people going through them a year. And what about the 'boxing 
  hooligans sure to follow? Dartmoor's got 'em. They'll emerge here, too, once 
  we're exposed, and no publicly listed clue will be safe from them. We'll pine 
  for the days when the worst we had to worry about was the red-tongued 
  hitchhikernapper. </p>
<p>     What can we do? Well, I know for a fact that 
  Martha's lurking in the background of these pages. She's probably read this 
  message before most of you will. Maybe, if we collectively scream 
  <strong>STOP!</strong> loudly enough, we can avert this holocaust. 
  <strong><em>Please</em>, post your disapproval.</strong> </p>
<p>bon Jour des Poissons, </p>

<p>     Last I knew, she was feverishly working on 
  <em>Maturin's Diary</em>. If she beats me to the <em>Beehive</em>, I'm gonna 
  be really pissed. </p>

<br/>
&gt; (I am so huffy about this I forgot to put the subject line in!!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I AGREE - WE ARE SCREWED!!  I AM SURE MARTHA SEE'S A DEFINITE COMMERCIAL<br/>
&gt; VENTURE IN THIS SOMEWHERE (pre made letterboxing kits with exacto knife,<br/>
&gt; stamp pad, carving medium.....)  Well, really, what did everyone expect to<br/>
&gt; happen when there was no secrecy involved anymore?  We have not been<br/>
covert<br/>
&gt; enough in our actions - too many people know about this game.  Also,<br/>
rather<br/>
&gt; than taking the time to have a nice walk in the woods, and eventually<br/>
&gt; getting to the "treasure box" - more often than not - newbies are racing<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; find boxes to increase their found/placed count.  Sort of defeating the<br/>
&gt; purpose  of the whole experience I think.  WHAT A CRYING SHAME!!!!   This<br/>
&gt; game is spoiled for sure!!  Too many people tromping through the woods as<br/>
&gt; it is now!  Why does everyone feel the need to broadcast this hobby?  My<br/>
&gt; son and I found out about letterboxing 3 or 4 years ago from a 4 line<br/>
blurb<br/>
&gt; in Smithsonian magazine.  We gleefully set off on our boxing adventures,<br/>
&gt; and have rarely shared our secret with people.  That may sound selfish -<br/>
&gt; but at least the game was more contained then.  Now, we can't even open a<br/>
&gt; local newspaper without running into an article on boxing.  WE ARE DONE<br/>
&gt; FOR!  Martha please, you have multi millions - do you really need to<br/>
&gt; increase your wealth yet again by commercializing a  hundred year old<br/>
&gt; hobby?  PLEASE LEAVE US ALONE!!! I am totally bummed by this whole deal.<br/>
&gt; And Leger de maine - WHAT WERE YOU  THINKING? Posting a recruitment poster<br/>
&gt; at the library?  I am sorry - but did you not think maybe the information<br/>
&gt; might fall into the wrong hands?  Let alone the local Audubon society that<br/>
&gt; lives for removing boxes from their property.  YIPES -  this is really a<br/>
&gt; sad state of affairs for sure.<br/>

<p>     About a month ago, I was contacted by a woman named Martha in response to a recruitment teaser I'd left on the bulletin board at the local library (see attachment). She was pleasant enough, and I explained the game to her, gave her a few of my clues, and directed her here. Since then, she's torn through my boxes at a rate that would make Wanda and Pete dizzy. Just about every night, for the last two weeks, I've gotten a note from her, detailing her day's 'boxing adventure. </p>
<p>     Little did I know, it was <em>the Martha</em>. Yes, Martha Stewart. She lives here, at least part of the time. We all see her on occasion. So, that's exciting, right? It would be fun to have a celebrity in our midst. But there's one hitch, and this is how I found out it was <em>the Martha</em>: She wants to do a show on letterboxing. She loves my boxes, and wants me to appear. I was appalled. You see, Martha has an uncanny way of finding all the good, local secret spots. Places few tourists find. Then she uses them as fodder for her lifestyle show, and guess who's lifestyle suffers? She's ruined this place with her exposure. <em>Now she's found letterboxing.</em> </p>
<p>     Don't get me wrong. I'm all for new players. After all, it was my recruitment notice that led her in the door. But there's much to be said for gradual growth. We are not ready to see a thousandfold increase in 'boxers! The price of Rubbermaid and erasers will skyrocket due to the new demand... that is, if you'll even be able to find them. The webmasters can barely keep up with the postings now. How will they cope with the surge? I tried to explain this to her, and begged her to keep this one for herself. She got kind of huffy... said she owed it to people to let them know about our fun game, so they could participate, too. (That's when I told her to keep the hell out of my boxes). Anyway, I'm thinking of pulling my boxes, or at least reconfiguring them to make them by invitation only. I know I couldn't keep up with hundreds of people going through them a year. And what about the 'boxing hooligans sure to follow? Dartmoor's got 'em. They'll emerge here, too, once we're exposed, and no publicly listed clue will be safe from them. We'll pine for the days when the worst we had to worry about was the red-tongued hitchhikernapper. </p>
<p>     What can we do? Well, I know for a fact that Martha's lurking in the background of these pages. She's probably read this message before most of you will. Maybe, if we collectively scream <strong>STOP!</strong> loudly enough, we can avert this holocaust. <strong><em>Please</em>, post your disapproval.</strong> </p>

away the original posting on this message, but as I recall the april <br/>
1 "time stamp" was in a portion of the mail called an X-header (I <br/>
think it was something like "X-actual arrival 4-1-2002" or something <br/>
like that. X headers are typically NOT put in by the mail delivery <br/>
system, they can be inserted by anyone who has an email client with <br/>
capability. So the point is that "time stamp" was completely bogus <br/>
and almost certainly meant the posting was a joke. The actual time <br/>
stamps on the message I received inserted by the yahoo system were <br/>
3-31-2002. Too bad, as Randy said it would probably be perversely <br/>
funnier to some of us very old timers if it were true.<br/>

her, gave her a few of my clues, and directed her here. Since then, she's
torn through my boxes at a rate that would make Wanda and Pete dizzy. Just
about every night, for the last two weeks, I've gotten a note from her,
detailing her day's 'boxing adventure.
<p>     Little did I know, it was <i>the Martha</i>.
Yes, Martha Stewart. She lives here, at least part of the time. We all
see her on occasion. So, that's exciting, right? It would be fun to have
a celebrity in our midst. But there's one hitch, and this is how I found
out it was <i>the Martha</i>: She wants to do a show on letterboxing. She
loves my boxes, and wants me to appear. I was appalled. You see, Martha
has an uncanny way of finding all the good, local secret spots. Places
few tourists find. Then she uses them as fodder for her lifestyle show,
and guess who's lifestyle suffers? She's ruined this place with her exposure.
<i>Now she's found letterboxing.</i>
</p><p>     Don't get me wrong. I'm all for new players.
After all, it was my recruitment notice that led her in the door. But there's
much to be said for gradual growth. We are not ready to see a thousandfold
increase in 'boxers! The price of Rubbermaid and erasers will skyrocket
due to the new demand... that is, if you'll even be able to find them.
The webmasters can barely keep up with the postings now. How will they
cope with the surge? I tried to explain this to her, and begged her to
keep this one for herself. She got kind of huffy... said she owed it to
people to let them know about our fun game, so they could participate,
too. (That's when I told her to keep the hell out of my boxes). Anyway,
I'm thinking of pulling my boxes, or at least reconfiguring them to make
them by invitation only. I know I couldn't keep up with hundreds of people
going through them a year. And what about the 'boxing hooligans sure to
follow? Dartmoor's got 'em. They'll emerge ! here, too, once we're exposed,
and no publicly listed clue will be safe from them. We'll pine for the
days when the worst we had to worry about was the red-tongued hitchhikernapper.
</p><p>     What can we do? Well, I know for a fact that
Martha's lurking in the background of these pages. She's probably read
this message before most of you will. Maybe, if we collectively scream
<b>STOP!</b> loudly enough, we can avert this holocaust. <b><i>Please</i>,
post your disapproval.</b>
</p><p>bon Jour des Poissons,
</p><p>legerdemaine
</p><p>     Last I knew, she was feverishly working on
<i>Maturin's Diary</i>. If she beats me to the <i>Beehive</i>, I'm gonna
be really pissed.
