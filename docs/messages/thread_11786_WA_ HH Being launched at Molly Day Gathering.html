&gt; On Sunday April 18th at the Molly Day Gathering which is going to <br/>
be held at<br/>
&gt; Diana's Pool in Chaplin CT, a hitchhiker called "Molly Looking for <br/>
Ginger<br/>
&gt; will be launched. The object of this Hitchhiker is to reach Ginger <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Golden Retriever  Letterboxer in Vernonia Oregon. To give it a <br/>
proper<br/>
&gt; sendoff, Anyone at the Molly Gathering will be able to stamp in. <br/>
we want to<br/>
&gt; get some good East Coast stamps in the log so when it gets to <br/>
Oregon they<br/>
&gt; will be able to see what us East Coast people have for stamps. <br/>
Much more<br/>
&gt; information about the hitchhiker, and Ginger will be available in <br/>
my next<br/>
&gt; post, at the gathering and on my website next week. Hope you all <br/>
can make it<br/>
&gt; Sunday. This is a very letterbox rich area. Should have a good day <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; boxing.....Chuck and Molly<br/>
