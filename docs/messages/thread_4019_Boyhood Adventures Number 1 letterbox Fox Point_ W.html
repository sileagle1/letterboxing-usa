Indian Creek, Fox Point, Wisconsin<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Clues-Easy, Terrain-Easy<br/>

<br/>
When I was growing up in Fox Point, Indian Creek was a place of wonder <br/>
and adventure. It was composed of fields of tall grass and trees. The <br/>
best part was The Creek, a deep drainage ditch with mud bottom, tall <br/>
grass and weeds along the sides and a huge assortment of living beings <br/>
from all neighborhoods of the animal kingdom. It was a magical place <br/>
to spend summer days with friends especially my buddy, Kimmy. We could <br/>
take a sack lunch and lurk in our tree fort spying on our wild <br/>
kingdom. There were tadpoles, small fish and turtles in the creek. <br/>
Muskrats, squirrels, rabbits, crows, red wing black birds and <br/>
dragonflies were also abundant. Best of all there were frogs to catch. <br/>
It was wild enough and expansive enough to provide a generation of <br/>
children with daily adventures and discoveries about the world that <br/>
would become theirs and about the human spirit that was growing within <br/>
each of them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometime after those golden years of boyhood Indian Creek got <br/>
"civilized."<br/>
<br/>
The tall wild grasses have been replaced with perfectly groomed <br/>
suburban lawn grass. The fields have been infested with tennis courts, <br/>
a ball field, a now-abandoned skating rink and a pre-fab playground <br/>
set. The largest part of the wild fields have been gouged and covered <br/>
with ostentatious multi-thousand-square-foot "Yuppie containers."  <br/>
People have the right to purchase property and to use it as they see <br/>
fit, but this former boy still feels a little bit sad to see the <br/>
change. Most of the wild trees have been sacrificed on the altar of <br/>
civilization and replaced with nursery-raised perfectly unremarkable <br/>
units. The creek now has a concrete bottom and supports no form of <br/>
life. No one's precious little darling is in danger of smelling creek <br/>
mud or having wild grass scratch their legs while running through on <br/>
daily missions fueled by infinite imagination. There are no smelly <br/>
animals to offend the delicate sensibilities of the current two legged <br/>
inhabitants if they should find the courage to venture out of their <br/>
containers.<br/>
<br/>
It's difficult to believe that the perfectly formed and installed <br/>
playground equipment can furnish the stimulation required for the <br/>
personal growth of the current young ones of that area. In fact the <br/>
place has become so boring that one rarely sees anyone there.<br/>
This letterbox is the first in a series to commemorate growing up with <br/>
adventures, fears, wonder and laughter shared with childhood pals. <br/>
Indian Creek was a place from which each day a generation of children <br/>
came home for supper very much dirtier and a little bit richer than <br/>
they had left.<br/>
<br/>
Fox Point is a village to the north of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. To reach <br/>
Indian Creek exit Interstate 43 at the Brown Deer Road exit. Proceed <br/>
east on Brown Deer Road and turn south at the first traffic light, <br/>
Port Washington Road. Travel approximately half a mile south to Dean <br/>
Road where there is another traffic light. Turn to the East on Dean <br/>
Road. You'll go down a slight hill and across a bridge over the <br/>
remains of Indian Creek. You'll see the ball field and the parking lot <br/>
on your right. Leave your car in the lot and proceed on foot along the <br/>
bank of the Creek with Dean Road behind you. You'll pass the tennis <br/>
courts and the perfectly safe and boring playground. Continue along <br/>
the bank to the footbridge. Stop for a minute and look across the <br/>
skating rink at the biggest mountain in our world and imagine being a <br/>
child headed down on a Flexible Flier for the first time, maybe scared <br/>
and maybe hearing Dad's encouraging words.<br/>
<br/>
 On your left side of the sledding hill you'll see a few surviving <br/>
trees. The largest one was home to our tree fort. When I was old <br/>
enough to go to "The Creek" alone, it had a sign proclaiming it to be <br/>
the rightful property of Jerry. I never met him, but he was part of <br/>
the mystery of our childhood.<br/>
<br/>
Continue along the creek bank to the "woods." Maintain your course <br/>
along the bank or on the woods path until you arrive at the dead end <br/>
paved road. Starting at the fire hydrant make your way through a <br/>
child's wilderness on a bearing of 140 degrees. After 28 steps you'll <br/>
come to a tree standing over a small hollow covered by branches. <br/>
You've reached the goal of your quest.<br/>
<br/>
Stamp in and pause to think of all the experiences involved in a <br/>
child's becoming an adult. Listen for the thousands of children's <br/>
voices still caught in the wind. Those voices are now ringing across a <br/>
world that is much bigger. Hopefully they still laugh and still <br/>
express true wonder at the beauty of life.<br/>
