wrong place when I saw all the posts about hypos and t-shirts.  But <br/>
then I saw the beginnings of flames and the word semiotics, and knew I <br/>
was home.  At the risk of adding more fuel to the fire, here is my 2 <br/>
cents:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Hypodermic Needles:  down here in the South we call these turkey <br/>
injectors, and you can get them anywhere from Academy to Amazon.  Not <br/>
sure how well they work on stamps, but they work great for injecting <br/>
spices into turkeys for frying.  I know it sounds weird, but fried <br/>
turkey is really good, and you know down south we have to fry <br/>
everything.  Oh, and by the way, both uses lead to carving.<br/>
<br/>
2.  T-Shirts:  I think "Shirtboxing" is a great name for the activity <br/>
of placing shirts in boxes, and there is even a website already set up <br/>
for y'all to use:  http://www.shirtbox.com/<br/>
<br/>
3.  Semiotics:  :)<br/>
