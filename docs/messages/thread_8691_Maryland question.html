Hunting isn't generally allowed in Maryland on Sundays. Here's a snippet <br/>
from the MD Department of Natural Resources web site <br/>
(http://www.dnr.state.md.us/huntersguide/) (Actually this page: <br/>
http://www.dnr.state.md.us/huntersguide/geninfo.html):<br/>
<br/>
&gt;IT IS UNLAWFUL TO:<br/>
<br/>
<snip><br/>
<br/>
&gt;Hunt any game bird or mammal on Sunday with the exception of: 1) a person <br/>
&gt;who possesses a Falconry Permit, who may hunt specified game birds and <br/>
&gt;mammals on Sundays during the open season; 2) an unarmed person <br/>
&gt;participating in an organized fox chase, who may chase foxes on Sundays; <br/>
&gt;and 3) persons hunting on Regulated Shooting Areas may hunt certain <br/>
&gt;pen-reared game birds on Sundays.<br/>
<br/>
<snip><br/>
<br/>
&gt;Note: The woodchuck and nutria are classified as "unprotected mammals." As <br/>
&gt;such, a hunting license is not required to hunt woodchucks and nutria <br/>
&gt;except in Baltimore and Frederick Counties. Woodchucks and nutria may be <br/>
&gt;hunted throughout the year, including on Sundays. Hunters must wear <br/>
&gt;fluorescent orange while hunting woodchucks. All legal hunting devices may <br/>
&gt;be used to hunt woodchucks. Nutria may be hunted with all legal hunting <br/>
&gt;devices except that rifles are limited to .22 caliber rimfire.<br/>
<br/>
While I don't make a habit of visiting the same places as hunters during <br/>
the season, I bought an inexpensive fluorescent orange vest to wear over my <br/>
jacket while hiking on Sundays or in areas where hunters might be illegally <br/>
hunting.<br/>
