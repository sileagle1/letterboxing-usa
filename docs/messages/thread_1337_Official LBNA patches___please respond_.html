Hello,<br/>
   I have the cost and info for the LBNA patches and window decals.<br/>
<br/>
The window decals are $4 each on orders of 25 or more...2 colors...they will <br/>
look just like the LBNA logo and wording found at the top of the LBNA web <br/>
page.<br/>
<br/>
A 2"x2" LBNA logo patch is $2.00 for 50 or more.<br/>
<br/>
the P# &amp; F# patches are 1-1/2" round badge patches also $2.00 for 50 or <br/>
more...divisions are P10, P25, P50, P100, P150  same for F#.   These patches <br/>
have the letter &amp; number and the North arrow for the Logo (the "A" in <br/>
America) in the center.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in buying these patches send me a note with the <br/>
quantity.<br/>
<br/>
This is the problem.....with other patches being offered  there may not be <br/>
the same interest in these LBNA patches.  I had a list of more than 80 <br/>
patches from the summer.   I need to be contacted in the next few days by <br/>
those who want these patches.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry that I'm going staight to the list and bypassing the web masters on <br/>
this...I thought this would be quicker.  <br/>
<br/>
Please respond as soon as possible.  YEa or Ney.<br/>
<br/>
Next... if quantities of 50 or more are not possible the next option is a <br/>
slightly more expensive patch on cloth  which is a little less stiff.   <br/>
<br/>
Please respond.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Mohmers<br/>
