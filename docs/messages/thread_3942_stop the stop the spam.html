I wanted to stay out of the quarterly debate on spam because all <br/>
of the possible wisdom on the topic is already in the archives 10 ways<br/>
from Sunday, but my inbox is being flooded by more mail about the spam <br/>
than the actual spam, so I will recycle some words.  Please don't send <br/>
me any more personal mail on the spam and the Yahoo! ads, etc. :-) <br/>
<br/>
I cannot make the Yahoo! ads go away (except by shelling out cash,<br/>
see later); as a media company, they are in business to make money <br/>
for their shareholders, and media companies make money by selling <br/>
advertising, not letting us use their resources for free.  Either <br/>
send complaints to Yahoo! directly, or consider some of the points <br/>
below ... (but a better use of time may be to work on clues or <br/>
something -- I did not enjoy writing the following, and cannot<br/>
imagine who would enjoy reading it ...)<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, if someone has a recommendation for a better service than <br/>
Yahoo!, feel free to speak up, and we can decide as a community.  <br/>
FWIW, I think the Microsoft service (I believe it is called "listbot") <br/>
is pretty lame.  I have not investigated other services.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there are two separate issues.  The Yahoo! generated advertising,<br/>
and the "spam".  The "spam" is off-topic e-mail sent by non-list members<br/>
trying to get you to buy something, etc.  The Yahoo! generated advertising<br/>
is ads appended to on-topic e-mails sent by list members, or imbedded in<br/>
the messages on the web site.  Some people sometimes get the two confused.<br/>
Yahoo! Inc, is not sending "spam" to the list, but _is_ appending ads.<br/>
<br/>
-------------<br/>
external spam<br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
The reason the list receives spam from external sources is that --<br/>
<br/>
a) the list has been around for a long time (meaning it has been mined and<br/>
   is in spammers' databases)<br/>
b) non-members are permitted to post<br/>
c) the list is not moderated<br/>
<br/>
a) and c) are not negotiable.  The historical reason for b) is that that<br/>
is the way the old timers wanted it.  It has the advantage of "openness",<br/>
meaning people could post letterbox clues without "joining", dealing<br/>
with "members only" vibes, and other noise like "registration".  The old <br/>
timers thought this was a Good Thing.  I imagine the old timers still <br/>
feel this way, I do anyway.  But like everything else, it is a tradeoff.  <br/>
b) can be changed by a supermajority vote of the list.  Changing b) will <br/>
eliminate external spammers unsophisticated enough to join the list before <br/>
spamming.  I don't know how sophisticated they are; there are more<br/>
important things for me to thing about ... If you think the spam is more<br/>
of a negative than the openness is a positive, make that point and start <br/>
a poll if you want.<br/>
<br/>
Other ways to deal with external spam is to run modern operating systems<br/>
like Linux (or Unix) (where you can use procmail, for example), or run <br/>
modern e-mail programs with sophisticated filtering capability.  Getting <br/>
into this is too much; there are plenty resources on these and other <br/>
spam mitigating techniques elsewhere on the 'net.  Some ISPs offer spam<br/>
filtering as a service.  Find one of these ISPs if you want.<br/>
<br/>
The best defense is to just delete it.  It is simply so much easier than <br/>
all this blather ... (Yes there is an argument against this attitude, but<br/>
IMO that argument is not tenable).  I could have deleted 1000 spams in the<br/>
time it took to write this drivel ...<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
Yahoo! generated ads<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
The last time I checked, and that was a _long_ time ago, you could pay<br/>
$48/year and make all the Yahoo! generated ads go away.  I imagine that<br/>
would apply to the new ads in the messages on the web site, though I<br/>
do not know that.  If someone wants to pass the hat and pay the rent,<br/>
feel free.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, the Yahoo! generated advertising can be divided into 2 <br/>
categories -<br/>
a) That which is attached to e-mails<br/>
b) That which appears when reading mail on the web<br/>
<br/>
The ways to deal with a) are again, to run Linux and use procmail to get<br/>
rid of them (I do this and it works well), or to pony up the $48.  At<br/>
one time (and perhaps you still can) you could trick the Yahoo! mailer <br/>
into not appending them by putting certain text in your message, but <br/>
trying to get everyone on the list to do that is not feasible.<br/>
<br/>
And a quick observation on the ads Yahoo! puts in the mail.  If you send<br/>
mail as plain text, it appends a relatively unobtrusive plain text ad.<br/>
If you send mail as html, it appends a honkin' mombo graphic that takes<br/>
decades to download from their ad server.  So send mail as plain text<br/>
(This is good list etiquette anyway, but again, getting everyone to do <br/>
this is a lost cause; I've seen it attempted on other lists).<br/>
<br/>
As for the honkin' ads Yahoo! puts when reading mail on the web, that<br/>
is a tough one.  Aside from the obvious don't read on the web, the obvious<br/>
stuff like turning off java and images in the browers did not work well<br/>
(turning off images still left a big space where the ad would go, but<br/>
it did speed up the download).  The only defense (besides paying), seems<br/>
to be to pre-process the html sent from Yahoo!, and that is beyond the <br/>
ken of most users, unfortunately.  Perhaps there are browers out there<br/>
that do it, I dunno.<br/>
<br/>
