I thought I would jump in here as I'm sure iohC is very busy gluing <br/>
some of the stuff that needs it. If you go to "Member Services" you <br/>
will find at the bottom a line for "Letterbox Status". You can disable <br/>
or enable the function by either clicking on this line. The flag on <br/>
the clue sheet lets a placer list the status of their clue. The flag <br/>
also allows a finder to list the date of the find or attempt. If the <br/>
Flags are a nuisance you can disable. I found it easier to record <br/>
finds on those clues not hosted by LBNA. In those cases I didn't have <br/>
to go to the clue sheet to record, but could record on the list of <br/>
clues for that area as those flags were on the larger list. The only <br/>
thing I have yet to figure out is the red markers. I guess it helps a <br/>
placer find their own clue sheets? <br/>

Yes!  I have green flags and a list of my finds!  Thank you so much<br/>
for all the help I got!  I did notice that for a series, all were<br/>
listed as finds even if I didn't find all the boxes in the<br/>
series..Anyone else notice that?<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks.  Moon Rabbit<br/>
