I am hoping that you already know about www.letterboxing.org. Clicking the<br/>
book gives you the US map and click on Texas give you all the clues. I have<br/>
recently updated TX with a couple of new boxes, but there has not been a lot<br/>
of activity down that way. It's hard to tell if the box owners are still on<br/>
the list or not.<br/>
<br/>
I know how disappointing not finding a box can be, especially for kids.<br/>
Think about letterbox from the approach of "If you hide them, they will<br/>
come"  Meaning the more YOU hid the more people will be draw into the area<br/>
and hopefully leave some of their own boxes behind for you.  Get the kids<br/>
involved by getting each of them a stamp of their own. Then take a look in<br/>
your nearest park for a place to hide your own letterbox. Your first ones<br/>
don't have to have fancy clues or hand made stamps. Store bought stamps will<br/>
do just fine. When I started, 2 years ago, there were only 2 people on<br/>
Northern VA letterboxing. I had to drive 90 minutes to bag my first. Early<br/>
on, I used the  "a find one, hide one" approach. There is almost always room<br/>
for another box in the same park. So my point is, make hiding your own box<br/>
just as big a part of the hobby as finding them.<br/>

    Funny you should ask.  I just hit the Mt. Bonnell box yesterday with an<br/>
amiga, and we were the first to stamp in.  Great location, great hiding<br/>
spot, nice stamp, easy enough for a quick strike with kids.  Good luck, have<br/>
fun.<br/>
