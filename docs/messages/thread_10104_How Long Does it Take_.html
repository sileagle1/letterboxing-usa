I'm new to letterboxing and, of course, to posting clues.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some questions: 1) how long does it take before one's clues are posted at the letterbox site? (I posted some and am so anxious to find them on the letterbox site.); 2) will my alternate e-mail address work properly in posting clues (I think it will, but don't want to waste my time if it won't.)?; and 3) Is it really better to develop one's own letterbox web page for simplicity in linking to the letterbox site?<br/>

We Webmasters are all volunteers, so we have to find time in our regular<br/>
schedules of school/work/home/whatever to do our various updates. I'm in<br/>
charge of Michigan (and most of the Midwest) and have your boxes in my<br/>

it is to see your "name in lights," so to speak -- having your clues on<br/>

<br/>
It has to be associated with your yahoo id.  Kick around yahoogroups's web <br/>
site to find out how to do this, I don't remember.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3) Is it really better to develop one's own letterbox web page<br/>

<br/>
It is really better.  Not only does it make it easier for the webmasters,<br/>
it allows you to edit your clues whenever the mood strikes.  I edit my clues <br/>
constantly.  On top of that, if you don't know how to create web pages,<br/>
you'll learn a basic skill that may be useful some day (like today, to take<br/>
control of publishing your own clues :-)).  I don't use them, but my guess <br/>
is that most of the big hosting companies have tutorials on how to create<br/>
web pages, and perhaps, if you use Windows, it may come with some sort of<br/>
"wizard" to create and publish them.<br/>
<br/>
People talk about stamp art, clue art, even box art and place art in <br/>
letterboxing.  Certainly the pages that actually host the clues could be part <br/>
of the art also.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>

The best part about creating your own webpage for the clues (in my <br/>
opinion), is that you can make them look exactly like YOU want.  One <br/>
of the 'features' I put on all my clues is their current status: <br/>
Confirmed missing, status unknown, or confirmed alive and well.  It <br/>
gets updated immediately that way, and nobody has to spend time <br/>
wacking through poison oak to learn the box was already reported <br/>
missing two months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Once you start making your own clue pages, you'll wonder how you ever <br/>
got by without doing so!  You'll start adding photos from pictures <br/>
you took while hiding the box, create lists of boxes you've found and <br/>
placed, and about a hundred other things that aren't really practical <br/>
while posting clues to the talk list.<br/>
<br/>
And knowing even the basics of HTML and creating webpages--it's a <br/>
FANTASTIC skill to have in this day and age!  It's far easier than <br/>
most people would imagine.  One of my favorite books is "HTML for the <br/>
World Wide Web" by Elizabeth Castro--it's a great tutorial and <br/>
reference and incredibly easy to understand.  Amazon.com has it at <br/>

<br/>
If you want to really go overboard and put in stuff like rollovers <br/>
(which is surprisingly easy to do), "JavaScript for the World Wide <br/>
Web" is wonderful.  I don't actually use it very much because I <br/>
prefer to know how JavaScript actually works rather than just copy <br/>
code to do something (and other books are better for that), but <br/>
that's a heck of a lot more complicated.  For most people, this book <br/>
is perfect to give their webpage an extra flair.  =)<br/>
