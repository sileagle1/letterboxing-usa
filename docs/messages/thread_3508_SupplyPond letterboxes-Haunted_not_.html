We loved this hike but couldn't find the third box. Have others found all<br/>
three, or might it be missing?<br/>
Could be that being new-ish letterboxers we're sometimes confused by clues.<br/>
Such as, when you come to a landmark (say a tree of 5) and the clue says<br/>
"from the tree proceed 270 Degrees", do we take the bearing while facing the<br/>
tree which is itself off the trail, or do we stand with our backs to the<br/>
tree to figure out the direction?<br/>
<br/>
any hints welcomed (the youngest amongst us voted to stay there all night<br/>
until we found it, but was vetoed, maybe the haunts really would have shown<br/>
up...)<br/>

<br/>
I would take the bearing from the actual feature (tree in this case).<br/>
Putting your back to the tree prolly doesn't matter (just being at<br/>
the tree should suffice).  The best thing to do is to try to think<br/>
what the clue writer was thinking (most likely they were standing<br/>
on the side of the tree that made walking on the bearing easy for<br/>
them (i.e. this is a west bearing; I'll bet 50 bucks they were standing<br/>
on the west-ish side of the tree when they wrote the clue, and not<br/>
the east side :-))).<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn't work, try any other ideas you have.  Sometimes the<br/>
clue writer gets the bearing 180 degrees off, so that is worth a try.<br/>
I can tell you that sometimes that works, and when I find such a box<br/>
with a 180 degree error, I am sometimes suprised at the number of<br/>
other people who have stamped up.<br/>
<br/>
