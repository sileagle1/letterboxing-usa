Heading south on Main Street (27 business route) in Nicholasville, turn <br/>
left onto Longview Drive across from Kroger. Follow Longview until it <br/>
turns into Park Drive which leads into the park.   <br/>
<br/>
Enter INTO the City/County park property.  Immediately on the right <br/>
hand side you will see a sign "JCYSA" and some baseball/softball <br/>
fields.  Turn RIGHT into the parking lot.  The sign will be on your <br/>
right.  See Cassity Park, turn right.  At break in fence turn left onto <br/>
gravel road.  <br/>
<br/>
At the dead end, walk up hill on left.  Walk carefully between <br/>
chainlink fence and scoreboard/wooden fence.  <br/>
<br/>
Corner of chainlink fence walk straight 25 paces to treeline.  Find the <br/>
large tree with the hollow in it.  <br/>
