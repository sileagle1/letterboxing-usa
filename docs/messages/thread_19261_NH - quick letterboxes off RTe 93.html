                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you are headed south on 93 there is a rest area just north of <br/>
exit 20 that is fairly quick.  It is called Red Spotted Newt. There <br/>
is one in Concord, about 5 minutes from exit 16 called NH Forest. <br/>
Also, there is a Covered Bridge Letterbox in Campton, just off the <br/>
exit. How far north are you headed?  My mind is tired this morning <br/>
but I may be able to come up with a few more.<br/>
