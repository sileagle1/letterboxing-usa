johnsblog on 9/8. Far be it from me to not play fair but I just need <br/>
a clarification on this one:<br/>
<br/>
- Hitchhikers count when initially planted by their <br/>
creator, and count as found when anyone else finds them. <br/>
Hitchhikers are letterboxes like anything else, therefore <br/>
if their creator finds his own creation, he can't count <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I know it's in black and white BUT if I find my own HH in a <br/>
different state after several stops esp in a HHH, I can't count it! <br/>
Flag on the field!<br/>
<br/>
I didn't take it since it said there had to be 2 HHs there. There <br/>
was only one (my old one) so I added a new one.<br/>

Either way, we're loving this new hobby and sharing it with the rest <br/>
of you!<br/>

written in stone.  I don't count much anymore, it's gotten to complex with all the <br/>
permutations of boxes, HH, cooties, table treats, virtuals, exchanges, postals and more I <br/>
can't name. I think there is even some count inflation going on. I just keep a genral count <br/>
of my finds. I've got 4 log books going now only one would be considered actual finds of <br/>
in the wild boxes.<br/>

match the numbers shown on LbNA or AtlasQuest. Personally, if I found <br/>
my own HH somewhere on the trail I would count it. Also, I found one <br/>
HH twice (not one of mine) and counted it twice, even though AQ will <br/>
only permit one "find" per HH. <br/>
