  Amother letterboxer from northern Illinois! I'm excited. I'm from <br/>
  Quad City area in Iowa. But, I do get around. I've been <br/>
  letterboxing in Rockford, Cherry Valley, Galena. There's some in <br/>
  between I'm gonna get to one of these days. Welcome to <br/>
  letterboxing. <br/>

  &gt; Welcome to the group!!! My family and I just joined a couple of <br/>
  weeks ago, and we make a day out of it each weekend!!! I stumbled <br/>
  across letterboxing too by chance. We are in the Chicago suburbs, <br/>
  and we go anywhere and everywhere in the Northen Illinois area, as <br/>
  for right now. LOL We've printed out almost all the clues on <br/>
  Atlasquest and Letterboxing.org and have them in folders. THe kids <br/>
  have a blast, and it's great for family time!! =)<br/>

  &gt; &gt; Hello Everyone...<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; We just started! Found out about it by accident, and thought <br/>
  it <br/>
  &gt; &gt; sounded great.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; We attempted 3 our first day - only located one. We think one <br/>
  was <br/>
  &gt; &gt; missed, and we think the other was moved.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; The next day - hit one - another was moved.<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Today... we found 8! 7 normal ones, and a hitchhiker!<br/>
  &gt; &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &gt; Been visiting all the sites, and am glad to be a part of this <br/>
  new <br/>
  &gt; &gt; hobby!<br/>

letterbox clues.  I've found that it's more popular in other parts <br/>
of the country.  However, when I post clues for my boxes on LbNA, I <br/>
also post them on Atlas Quest by using a link to LbNA.  I've had <br/>
responses from people who got clues from Atlas Quest and left <br/>
letters for me.  It's fun to get feedback.  I personally check LbNA <br/>
first, then AQ.<br/>
