<br/>
Island Sanctuary received a new bag, as the one in the box was very wet (contents were still dry)  <br/>
<br/>
Attempted to replace the box at Fort Getty (it is squished and cracked), unfortunately the extra boxes I've been carrying are too small.  (figures ;-) Next person out that way may want to bring an extra box.<br/>
<br/>
Fort Wetherill was dry and the box was still in good shape.  Thanks for the great spots.  <br/>

P.S. has Beavertail been replaced yet?  Just curious.<br/>
