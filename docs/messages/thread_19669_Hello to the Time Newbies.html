the Newboxers group.http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/join<br/>
<br/>
While the Silver Backs of this group do like the new blood, we <br/>
sometimes find that the new finders can put our planted letterboxes <br/>
at risk. The enthusiasm and exuberance of the "Find" can sometimes <br/>
put secrecy, stealth and caution on the back burner. Whenever a <br/>
major publication(none quite as big as Time) puts a letterbox story <br/>
included in their articles it seems as though many letterboxes tend <br/>
to go missing and some of us shudder, and wonder how many will need <br/>
to be replaced. In so far as this list is concerned, it is for <br/>
discussion about letterboxing--- it is not letterboxing. So if you <br/>
don't have a thick skin, then you can enjoy this game without <br/>
chatting about it-- just go out and letterbox!<br/>

&gt; we have had some very strong differences of opinions with<br/>
&gt; others, we have found that most people on this list will welcome you<br/>

&gt; these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; topics have been discussed to the max on this "big" list.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; On the Pepe's talk list, no question about letterboxing is <br/>
taboo.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nobody will flame you. Think of Mark like the protector of <br/>
&gt; Newbies.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We really should cannonize him. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes - this list is not for the faint of heart, however,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we have made some true friends through letterboxing and <br/>
although<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we have had some very strong differences of opinions with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; others, we have found that most people on this list will <br/>
welcome <br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; into their hearts, and their homes. Most 'boxers will go out <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; their <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way to meet you if you happen to be in their area. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We do welcome you to Letterboxing - try not to have a thin <br/>
skin <br/>
&gt; but <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; if you do - remember that Mark Pepe is now designated as the <br/>
&gt; Newbie <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Protector!<br/>

After reading the Time magazine article, I just checked out yahoogroups to <br/>
see what might be out there in the way of discussion groups.  <br/>
<br/>
For groups that are more "advanced" and whose members might not appreciate <br/>
the people brand new to letterboxing or even people just exploring the *idea* of <br/>
letterboxing, it might not be a bad idea to change the group description on <br/>
yahoogroups to point people totally new to the one particular group for <br/>
newbies.  From what I can remember about reading the descriptions of the various <br/>
letterboxing discussion groups, none of them were at all discouraging to newbies.  <br/>

trying to look for the right place &amp; don't want to upset any <br/>
seasoned vets!  <br/>
<br/>
It is frustrating to old timers to see the same questions again &amp; <br/>
again, but newbies don't know that is the 872 time we have answered <br/>
that question.  <br/>
<br/>
Another solution would for everyone have a standard response such as <br/>
<br/>
"Welcome to letterboxing!  Please first visit the files section to <br/>
the left   &lt;---- and click on Information for new letterboxers.  All <br/>
new letterboxers should post any further newbie questions to the New <br/>
Letterboxers group. Please be sure to visit us in the future for in <br/>
depth &amp; veteran discussions on this group." :)<br/>
<br/>
Gets the point across without too much slicing &amp; dicing<br/>
