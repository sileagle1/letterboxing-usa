There are 3 letterboxes hidden there. From the capital beltway take the Geogria Ave exit west and turn right at Shorham Drive it goes right into it. Or find the Directions to Brookside Gardens and that will also take you there. It is a big park and lots of entrances. You can check out the lbna map and that will lead you to the two gray squirrels web page where you can find clues to the Wheaton Boxes as well as others in the area. Hope your daughter finds them and hides more, I took would like more to look for. My feeling is if you hide them they will come.<br/>

I had also thought of a civil war series and a revolutionary war series (can you live in MD and VA without thinking of it?) but have not acted on it. There are tons of sites here, some of the gounds may be too well groomed to use but many are not. The Washington Monument site that I hid a box in last weekend is both Civil war and Revolutionary also Harpers Ferry. Most parks in the mid atlantic region has some war history so I don't think it would be hard to come up with a series. <br/>
<br/>
With regard to the roadside stuff. I think that is just fine. I have limitations on how far and how rugged of a hike I can manage so I like some of the easier ones. I wish to thank everyone for hideing both rough trail and easy trail boxes.  I have been hiding two boxes to a site so that if one is gone then the other might still be there. If one could be a rugged trail box and the other a more accessable box that would be great too. Just a suggestion.<br/>
