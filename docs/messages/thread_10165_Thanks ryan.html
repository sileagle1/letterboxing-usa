&gt; reading by foisting your opinions as the best way, the right way,<br/>
&gt; the most logical way.  If you don't like hybrids don't look for<br/>
&gt; them, but quit trying to convince others to stop placing them.<br/>
<br/>
And I suppose YOUR post is supposed to brighten up everyone else's <br/>
day, huh?  <br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to HELP people create the best possible letterboxes.  <br/>
Listening to a little constructive criticism isn't the end of the <br/>
world.  I've tried to keep my discussion logical, simple, and civil.  <br/>
<br/>
Even if I personally didn't care about hybrids one way or another I'd <br/>
still recommend people not to place them--they simply aren't <br/>
popular.  If I was the ONLY person that thought that, I'd keep my <br/>
mouth shut, but I'm not.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Let it rest.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to, until you made your post.  Doah!  If you want to <br/>
critize me in e-mail, I'll keep it private.  If you want to complain <br/>
about me publicly, I feel honor-bound to defend myself publicly.<br/>
