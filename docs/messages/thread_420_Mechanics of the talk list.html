&gt;  ...On lists set up with "reply to sender" as default, when I have<br/>
&gt;  replied to an individual when I meant to reply to the group at large,<br/>
&gt;  I can always resend to the list.  The other way around, though,<br/>
&gt;  you can't take it back.<br/>
&gt;  ...it only took one accidental post to make me think that I could<br/>
&gt;  get along very well without ever replying to anything.<br/>
<br/>
I think it was me who was supposed to get that post that<br/>
went out to the list.  But that's OK.  I've said lots of<br/>
personal stuff on the list.  I don't remember what that<br/>
particular post said, but I'm sure it was not terribly<br/>
harmful.  So no harm done.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the concern about misdirecting messages and<br/>
I understand why some people like to keep their information<br/>
private.  I am more cautious with some people (keeping<br/>
the private things they share with me off the list), esp.<br/>
when they seem to be more concerned about it, and I'll<br/>
now be esp. so with Deborah also because she has expressed<br/>
a concern about snail mail addys and about her privacy.<br/>
And I would ask everyone else to respect Deborah's privacy<br/>
too and anyone else for whom privacy may be particularly<br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Deborah apologized to me for the mistaken email.  It<br/>
didn't upset me that it happened, but I really appreciated<br/>
her apology anyway.  It was very nice of her to be concerned.<br/>
I also apologized to the person who I made that same mistake<br/>
with a few months back when I sent an email to Erik that<br/>
went out to the list by mistake.  It makes all the difference<br/>
in the world I think - trying to be honest and when making<br/>
a mistake simply apologizing for it.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose its inevitable with email for this to happen.<br/>
If something goes out by mistake I think its good<br/>
to go in and say, "Please don't share that piece of info with<br/>
others." or "I really didn't mean to put it that way.  I'd like<br/>
to take that back.  I'm sorry if i offended anyone."  These are<br/>
the ways I would suggest handling misspoken or misdirected<br/>
messages.<br/>
<br/>
The egroups thing we are voting on is another possible solution.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Me, too, Daniel. I think I have shared some things that I would<br/>
consider personal, maybe not lots ~ but some.<br/>
And I also think that kind of sharing is what makes the list<br/>
more interesting and well, personal. It would be very dry<br/>
and dull indeed if we didn't know anything about anyone else.<br/>
I enjoy reading about the other hobbies, work, families and <br/>
children, vacations, Harleys, and etc., just as much as I <br/>
enjoy reading about the latest letterbox set out or found.<br/>
   If it's inconvenient for anyone to change defaults because of the<br/>
way their mail program works or just because most like it <br/>
the way it is, that's fine with me. (You might have to put up<br/>
with my absent-minded "oopsies" sometimes, though!)<br/>
   I do make a distinction between private and personal, <br/>
though. I am concerned about accidently posting someone's<br/>
snail address or phone, for example, but I don't mind if you<br/>
all know this true confession ~<br/>
I may be the only living person who liked that TV show <br/>
"Cop Rock" and I'm sorry I only have one episode taped.<br/>

please be very careful about checking to see who you are sending it to.  If <br/>
you make a mistake and post something inappropriate, you can log on to the <br/>
egroups service and remove the message yourself, or notify me (or Dan) and <br/>
have it removed from the archives.  Of course, we can't UNSEND a message... <br/>
the members of the list will recieve it once you've sent it.  However, the <br/>
members of this list are LETTERBOXERS... all of whom are noble, courteous, <br/>
respectable members of a civilized society.  (myself excluded... but then, <br/>

<br/>
SPICY TOFU BURRITOS - serves 4 to 6<br/>
<br/>
2 tablesoons vegetable oil<br/>
3 garlic cloves, minced or pressed<br/>
1 fresh chile, minced, or -   teaspoon cayenne<br/>
2 medium onions, finely chopped<br/>
1 green pepper, diced<br/>
2 teaspoons paprika<br/>
1 tablespoon ground cumin<br/>
1 teaspoon dried oregano<br/>
 cup fresh or frozen cut corn<br/>
1 to 1- lbs. firm or extra firm tofu, crumbled<br/>
 cup tomato paste<br/>
2 tablesoons soy sauce<br/>
salt and pepper to taste<br/>
6 large flour tortillas (10 inch)<br/>
<br/>
Heat the oil in a large skillet and saute the garlic., chile or cayenne, and onions for a minute or two. Stir in the diced green pepper and continue to saute on medium heat.  When the onions begin to soften, add the paprika, cumin, oregano, corn, and crumbled tofu and continue to saute.<br/>
<br/>
Preheat the oven to 350.<br/>
<br/>
When the vegetables are tender mix in the tomato paste and soy sauce.  Add salt and pepper to taste.<br/>
<br/>
Lightly oil a 9" x 13" baking pan.  Fill each tortilla with about  cup of the tofu-vegetable filling and roll it up.  Place the burritos in the oiled pan, cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake for 20 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Serve topped with salsa, if desired.<br/>
<br/>
(This recipe is adapted from one in the "Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home," one of my favorite vegetarian cookbooks-everything in it is foolproof and tasty!)<br/>

&gt; Well, this Sunday I'm going to hunt for my first letterboxes ever...the ones<br/>
&gt;  at Johnson Creek sound do-able for my first time. I'm getting my stamp all<br/>
&gt;  set up :) Yay!!! <br/>
<br/>
Hi Cara,<br/>
<br/>
I wondered if you guys had been out yet.  I toured some of the boxes<br/>
nearby &amp; found and entry in RC#2 by a "Morris."  Anyone wanna confess to<br/>
being Morris?<br/>
<br/>
I pledge to get Rock Creek #1 back in place by the weekend.<br/>

Pobrecito Randy! You'll probably get this message many times over...  click<br/>
on the above URL, and when you get to the Letterbox USA site, click on<br/>
Oregon in the clues and maps section.  You should see the clues there.   By<br/>
the way...When I've got my letterbox all ready to go, how do I get the clues<br/>
out to folks?  Thanks, Cara<br/>

It's good to know that you can go into the archives to remove something.<br/>
It may come in handy sometime to know that. Thanks.<br/>
