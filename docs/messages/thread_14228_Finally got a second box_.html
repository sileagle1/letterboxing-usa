We were actually surprised we found it, as we were 1 in 6 at the time! We<br/>
were thinking we had to be the worst letterboxers in history. Not surprising<br/>
if you knew how often I get lost in my car, lol! We found Sparky's Friend,<br/>
and all was well with him. We are so addicted, lol, we are planning on<br/>
hitting First Landing today. We are currently recarving stamps, as due to<br/>
the high heat our fell off our wood blocks (I used low heat hot glue) and<br/>
they got kinda tore up in the bag. Any suggestions for Virginia heat &amp;<br/>
humidity proof glue? Kerri aka Lone Pony<br/>
