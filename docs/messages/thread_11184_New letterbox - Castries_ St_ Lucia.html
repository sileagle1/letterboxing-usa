Difficulty - You need to get to St. Lucia.  After that it's easy<br/>
Time - 10 minutes<br/>
Directions to starting place -  Find your way to Point Seraphine <br/>
Shopping area in Castries on the beautiful island of St. Lucia.  <br/>
Outside the shops is a big boat dock.  Go to west end of the boat<br/>
dock <br/>
overlooking the water.  There are two giant red things to which the <br/>
ships can be anchored.  Stand behind the red thing and look pretty <br/>
much to the north.  You will see another red thing with steps leading <br/>
to it.  This is how you know you are in the right spot.<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - I'm not sure if the shopping area is open<br/>
if <br/>
the ships are not in the port. Sorry for not getting that piece of <br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know -<br/>
St. Lucia is 27 miles long and 14 miles across at the widest point. <br/>
I <br/>
wish we had gone to see the volcano while visiting.  I could be<br/>
wrong, <br/>
but this may be the first letterbox planted on St. Lucia.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Turn and head 5 steps at 20 degrees to a shallow blue wall.  At the <br/>
southern end of the wall on the ocean side you will find your<br/>
treasure <br/>
beneath some rocks.  Please be as discreet as possible, as people<br/>
will <br/>
surely wonder what on earth you are doing.  This is an orphan box.  <br/>
Please care for it as best you can if it has needs.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
