local lists and keep in touch with a few trail friends. Anyway Hi to <br/>
all and news . I will be in the Lancaster County , Pa. area for a few <br/>
days in March and will be planting a few boxes have a couple in mind <br/>
already. I plan to get the Bridges then too as we have driven through <br/>
them before on previous trips. When in Lancaster County its always so <br/>
much to do and so little time. Any parks you can recommend in need of <br/>
a box or other ideas let me know.Hope your spring will be ahead of <br/>
ours need some green up here!    Carol - Leader of the Pack<br/>
