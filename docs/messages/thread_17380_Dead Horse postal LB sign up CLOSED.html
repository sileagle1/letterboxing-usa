Thanks everyone who emailed me. I now have more than enough <br/>
participants signed up at this time. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry to those who won't be able to sign up. I had to limit the <br/>
number of participants so Dead Horse could be back "home" before we <br/>
moved aboard the boat in April.<br/>
<br/>
You may yet have the opportunity to add Dead Horse to your logbook <br/>
though.  I will be turning him loose as a hitch hiker when he <br/>
completes his postal rounds.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
