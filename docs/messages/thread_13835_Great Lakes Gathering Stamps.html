                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you to Springchick for that great souvenir of the Great Lakes Gather!  <br/>
The stamps in the booklet were beautiful (we feel very outdone!).  Even the <br/>
envelope was covered with beautiful stamps!<br/>
<br/>
We really enjoyed seeing both the special stamps carved for this event as <br/>
well as the stamps and greetings from everyone who signed into our box.  <br/>
What fun!<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to replanting the "Peace of DC" box in the DC area soon.  <br/>
I'm sure the mid-atlantic boxers will enjoy seeing some of the stamps from <br/>
the Great Lakes region.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again! BeMa<br/>
