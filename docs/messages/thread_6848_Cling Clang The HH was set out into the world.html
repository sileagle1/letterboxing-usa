<div>Cling Clang was an actual peddler man who traveled 
up and down the coast of Maine and New Hampshire selling his wares. He carried 
two large stilts that he would place in front of him so he could catapult 
himself 12 feet forward in one leap. This way he covered twice as much ground in 
half the time. His peddlers pack which was strapped to his back would make all 
kinds of noise which is where his name came from.  </div>

<div>Please help Cling Clang see the world. This is my 
favorite stamp that I have planted so please let me know where he is and how he 
is doing. </div>
