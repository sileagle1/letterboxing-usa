IF you're not against a sturdy plastic, I'd think the containers that <br/>
I use to store rods for welding in would work good.  They are round, <br/>
though, about 12" long, and probably 3" in diameter, with a screw on <br/>
lid, and is water tight, to keep your rods from drawing damp.  Check <br/>
them out at any place that sells welding supplies, or you can take a <br/>
look at one at Amazon.com... will post link below.  :-)<br/>

Similar to paint cans (which we have also found in remote areas.)  We <br/>
plan to try a round can in which we bought Irish Oatmeal.  It is metal <br/>
and closes with a tight-fitting cap like a paint can.  The clue will <br/>
need to advise boxers to bring a bottle opener, screwdriver, or other <br/>

larger containers.  It will have plenty of room for hitchhikers, large <br/>

That sounds like it's going to be leaky.  And if it's not leaky from day 1, then it will be once people start finding it, since the opening and closing of the lid will start to deform the metal.  It will probably also get rusty after a season sitting outside.  I think you'd be better off sticking with L&amp;Ls.<br/>

  &gt; My other question is have any of you made your own container or is <br/>
  &gt; there a similar strength container out there that you have used or <br/>
  run <br/>
  &gt; across that my be a little more applicable to letterboxing? <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Thank you<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">To me, it would also kinda depend on just what park it is and where the box<br/>
was located inside that park before necessarily hanging the "paranoid" label<br/>
on rangers and such.<br/>
<br/>
For example, we have Argonne National Laboratories in Darien, IL sitting<br/>
right in the middle of a very large DuPage County Forest Preserve.  I get<br/>
paranoid myself because whenever I'm too close to the Argonne property, my<br/>
cellphone tunes out completely.  (I'm one of those folks who was the last<br/>
person on earth to get a cellphone but who now suffers severe separation<br/>
anxiety when I forget it at home or it's not getting any reception.)<br/>
Anyway, if a box was planted way over on the other side of the preserve<br/>
(altho any boxes in DuPage preserves are supposed to be pre-approved by the<br/>
preserve folks), paranoia might not set in too much but I can imagine law<br/>
enforcement being called if the box were placed a little too close to that<br/>
big ol' security fence surrounding Argonne and that box hadn't had any<br/>
pre-approval.<br/>
<br/>
We also have the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, IL.  That<br/>
too has some very nice forest preserve lands around it, nice dog training<br/>
field where dogs can run around free off-lead, nice bike paths, nice bison,<br/>
etc.  There too, however, I wouldn't go planting any letterboxes.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
There are natural gas lines running thru some of our preserves and those<br/>
huge huge electrical set-ups that are surrounded by nice big high security<br/>
fencing with all kinds of keep-out and no-trespassing signs -- the "Danger<br/>
Will Robinson! Danger!" kind of signs.  And two of our county preserves are<br/>
right on either side of big railroad switching stations for trains.  Boxes<br/>
right in the vicinity of any of that type of stuff might seem a teensy bit<br/>
suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if it were a preserve where it's only claim to fame was<br/>
the nice bike path or the nice babbling brook or a winter sled hill, I would<br/>
tend to think law enforcement calling in the bomb squad might be a bit of<br/>
overkill.<br/>

I can believe it would happen.  In this day and age people are very paranoid<br/>
about strange looking packages sitting in strange places.<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes worry about being spotted letterboxing by law enforcement.<br/>
Now...just visualize what that looks like to someone who has no clue what<br/>
it's about!<br/>

 &gt; Hey - a word of caution - I made a mistake of mentioning to a park<br/>
 &gt; ranger that I had planted a box and he sort of freaked out.  He<br/>
 said<br/>
 &gt; I had to remove it - yea right.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Anyway, he was saying that a box was found in one park and the feds<br/>
 &gt; were called in and blew up someone's geo-cache because it showed up<br/>
 &gt; some evidence of gun powder (I'm not sure of all the details).<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; So---- unless you want your box on CNN, be careful with the camo -<br/>
 &gt; (of course, I know that's tempting, too).<br/>
