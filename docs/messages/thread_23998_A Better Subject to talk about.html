weather was unseasonably warm.  Yesterday we had just finished up a series<br/>
of four letterboxes and a single letterbox off the same trail.  As we<br/>
headed back to our car, I saw a family lingering near a spot where we were<br/>
earlier in the morning.  I saw "Dad" with a piece of paper.  My better<br/>
half did not want to stop, but I did, and I met a new letterboxing family.<br/>
 They had just found their very first letterbox!!!  I'm sure they were<br/>
surprised to find someone else out doing the very same thing.<br/>
