Anniversary Box<br/>
Today, December 16, we celebrated our 7th year of wedded bliss!  In <br/>
commemoration, we placed a letterbox near one of our favorite <br/>
vistas.  We hope you enjoy the spot as much as we do.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to Salt Water State Park: <br/>
Take I-5 to Exit 147.  Head West on 272nd St. and cross over Pacific <br/>
Highway (aka Hwy 99).  Turn right onto 16th Ave. So.  Continue to the <br/>
Woodmont Dr. S. light and turn Left onto Woodmont Dr. S.  The road <br/>
curves quite a bit and then becomes Marine View Dr. S.  Keep to the <br/>
main road until you reach 252nd and turn Left.  Turn Left into Salt <br/>
Water State Park and park in the first parking lot on your left.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to the Anniversary Box:<br/>
Cross the road from the parking lot on the crosswalk.  Take the trail <br/>
to the restrooms.  At the restrooms take the trail at about 130.  <br/>
Continue on the trail until you pass a large stone chimney on your <br/>
right.  Continue on the trail at about 200.  Pass under a skinny, <br/>
twisted Madrone arch.  Keep the fencing to your left and pause <br/>
occasionally to enjoy the views.  The beach is beautiful and on a <br/>
clear day you have majestic views across the water to the Olympics!  <br/>
Find a tall Fir on your right sheltering its young one from the salty <br/>
wind.  Have a seat on the bench next to the firs and enjoy the <br/>
undulating water, rythmically lapping waves and soft, salty breeze <br/>
some more!  Stand between the trees and bench facing about 50 and <br/>
take 9 steps to the 3 ft. stump.  The box is there, at its roots, <br/>
snug in a den on the South side, hidden behind some bark and a <br/>
stone.  Stamp in, hide it well and then please continue along the <br/>
fence and enjoy the rest of the peaceful scenery.  At a hugging fir <br/>
and Pacific Madrone the trail curves away to your right and will lead <br/>
you back to your vehicle.  <br/>
This is our 1st completed letterbox - Enjoy!<br/>
