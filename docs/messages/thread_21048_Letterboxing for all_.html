I loved the tv news story about letterboxing. I love seeing articles <br/>
written about it. I found out about letterboxing years ago through a <br/>
Hartford Courant article and did'nt have to join a private club or <br/>
know the right people to partake. I've hidden over 80 boxes and have <br/>
had numerous disappear or get vandelized. Do I wish all people <br/>
respected other peoples pursuits? Yes. Will they? No. Do I want to <br/>
restrict who has access to Letterboxing? No. Because without that <br/>
article, I may never have been introduced to this great hobby and I <br/>
in turn would'nt have introduced many of my family and friends to <br/>
this great diversion. I also would'nt have planted 80+ boxes for <br/>
others to discover. Or would I have met so many friendly faces along <br/>
a dirt trail or gathering. I tend to believe that most people who <br/>
bike or hike (or watch tv or read a newspaper) will enrich this hobby <br/>
and not hurt it.<br/>
