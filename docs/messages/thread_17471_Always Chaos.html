"Clues DON'T BOTHER- They've been vandalized and won't be replaced.<br/>
Thanks for looking!"<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could edit it to reflect the ones that really are missing <br/>
or delete the clues completely. It looks to me as if the boxes gone <br/>
missing were not a personal attack on you by folks with clues in hand <br/>
as you suppose. I hadn't seen your note until after we went out this <br/>
weekend (Saturday) and found three.<br/>
<br/>
We also found that the boxes that had gone missing were in high<br/>
traffic areas and the hidey holes were quite visible to the casual<br/>
non-boxing passerby. (Easy for us! Easy for them!)<br/>
<br/>

BOILING SPRINGS<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails Letterbox (1) is fine (we found a hitchhiker there)<br/>
Four-leaf Clover (#2 in the Series) - is fine<br/>
<br/>
LETORT PARK<br/>
<br/>
Lucky Pig (#6 in the Series) - found the tree, also a VERY obvious<br/>
spot in a high 'hang-out' area, could've easily been found by a non-<br/>
boxer.<br/>
<br/>
Acorn (#7 in the Series) Not there and the place was VERY obvious,<br/>
could've been found easily by a non-boxer<br/>
<br/>
THORNWALD PARK (It's quite dark now, reading clues by cigarette<br/>
lighter)<br/>
<br/>
Mani Wheel (#3 in the series) - found rock (we think) tree sign is no<br/>
longer there. Didn't see the box<br/>
Fu (#5 in the Series) is there - we stamped in.<br/>
Lady Bug - Dark now, think we found the rock, not box<br/>
