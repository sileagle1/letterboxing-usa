                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi folks.  It's been a very busy week for those of us preparing to go <br/>
back to teaching, so I'll keep this short.  By the time I was able to <br/>
get online to make a camping reservation at Nickerson State Park for <br/>
the October 4th event, there were no sites available in the section <br/>
6/6x region, so we have reserved our spots in the site 7 area near <br/>
Higgins and Little Cliff pond.  We still hope to have the event in a <br/>
Pavilion, or if not possible at the Flax Pond picnic area (near a <br/>
parking lot).  We will post the exact location to meet at the park <br/>
entrance on the day of the event.  As the event develops, I will post <br/>
it as a "letterbox" with relevant details.  Hope to see many of you <br/>
there.<br/>
