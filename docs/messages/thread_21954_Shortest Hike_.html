Maybe - one LB I found was about 7 ft up in a tree.  Getting it down  with a <br/>
stick wasn't hard, but to put it back, I pulled my Miata (convertible) up  to <br/>
the tree, stood on the seat to reach up to replace it.  Does that  count?  <br/>

Boy!!!! I wish someone would do that for me!!!!!  Sounds like fun!  Chrissy, Kreepy Kelli and I actually hid letterboxing stamps in Chrissy's dad's house as a present for letting us stay there.  We made her dad and his girlfriend look for them!<br/>
