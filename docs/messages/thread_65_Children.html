&gt; ...the authority of my 12 year old daughter.  I asked her this<br/>
&gt; question the other day and she very convincingly told me that of<br/>
&gt; course they were all male because after all they were the belongings<br/>
&gt; of a little boy and the only reason Kanga had to be female was<br/>
&gt; because she was a mom...<br/>

I'm just echoing the sentiments of your child.  It would never<br/>
occur to her that it is necessary for Christopher to be a girl<br/>
because obviously he is not the mom.  I see what she is saying.<br/>
BTW, you are obviously a thoughtful mom Deborah as you often <br/>
include the views of your children.  Thank you.<br/>
