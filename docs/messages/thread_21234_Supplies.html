Since I can't remember which list was recently talking about these <br/>
two things, I thought I'd just post it to all 3 as others might be <br/>
interested. <br/>
<br/>
I was looking at their magnifying lamp ($19.19) and ran across these <br/>
two things on clearance:<br/>
<br/>
Archival Photo Corners - 240 corners for $1.67.<br/>
Portable Chair/Stool - 16" for $11.37 or 19" for $12.07<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how long these will be available as clearance. The lamp <br/>
is available as a regular item/price. They also have rubber stamping <br/>
supplies and cutters, etc. <br/>
<br/>
You can find these at www.dickblick.com. It's an art store that I <br/>
used to frequent when I lived in Illinois. Unfortunately, the closest <br/>
one to me now is a state away in Georgia. :-(  Luckily, they have <br/>
online ordering.<br/>
<br/>
I know it's not "kosher" to post about products, but thought some <br/>
might be interested. <br/>
