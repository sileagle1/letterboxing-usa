wonderful ideas that stretch the concepts of letterboxing.  Recently <br/>
I was thinking about some postal letterboxes I had visits from, Elmo <br/>
and Stumpy the Sock Monkey to name a couple.  These boxes included <br/>
small stuffed animals which I enjoyed taking letterboxing with me <br/>
and adding to their adventures.  I also truly enjoyed seeing the <br/>
albums being created as they traveled around the country.<br/>
<br/>
About a month ago we started discussing this on a few of the boards <br/>
and Boxing Buddies were born!<br/>
<br/>
How to create a Boxing Buddy:<br/>
<br/>
1. Find a little buddy.<br/>
2. Carve your buddy a stamp. (Every letterboxer needs their own <br/>
signature stamp.)<br/>
3. Make or buy a log book large enough to accommodate his adventures.<br/>
4. Let other boxers know your boxing buddy is looking for a host!<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like to host a Boxing Buddy:<br/>
<br/>
1. Request a visit from an available buddy when you're planning a <br/>
letterboxing excursion.<br/>
2. Take your visiting buddy with you and take pictures of him on the <br/>
trail, stamp his signature stamp into the boxes he visits and stamp <br/>
the box stamps in his log book.<br/>
3. Add details (and photos) about your adventures to his log and get <br/>
him ready to visit another host family.<br/>
<br/>
You do not need to create a Boxing Buddy to host one and you do not <br/>
need to offer to be a host to create one. You can get involved <br/>
however you would like.  You can even have more than one traveling <br/>
around if you like.  A Boxing Buddy is a great way to `see' boxes <br/>
you might otherwise never get to see.<br/>
<br/>
There are already dozens of boxing buddies traveling around the <br/>
globe.  You can find them on AQ or join in the discussion at:<br/>

blogs you can go to a wonderful site set up by Team New Hampshire at:<br/>

questions.  Happy Boxing!<br/>
