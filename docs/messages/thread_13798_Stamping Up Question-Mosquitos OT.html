deet?  One is that you can rub "Bounce" dryer sheets on you.  The <br/>
other is that I'm told that "Skin so Soft" from Avon will also do the <br/>
trick.  However I haven't tried that one.  I know the first one works.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that to keep the bugs away from you like bees, mosquitos, <br/>
fleas, etc.  Take your B Complex vitimans.  They don't like how you <br/>
your blood smells, it's not so "sweet"  which is what attracts them.<br/>

&gt; Mosquitos are fierce with all the rains we've had, so we have tried <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; We noticed that another letterboxer pre-stamps onto stickers <br/>
&gt; (Moonstone Baby?). Although we prefer stamping directly, we have <br/>
&gt; recently taken to using this idea for the stamps in our group that <br/>
&gt; take more than one color.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We do these multi-color inked stamps on white self-stick labels <br/>
&gt; before we go. This allows us to put in a nice image quickly without <br/>
&gt; getting ravaged by mosquitos. <br/>
&gt; Fluff hasn't taken to this approach so she still stamps in. She <br/>
uses <br/>
&gt; only one color, so I can live with that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We also keep only a single family log book - that saves us time as <br/>
we <br/>
&gt; stamp the box's image only once. That just happened to be how we <br/>
&gt; started and the kids have turned down later offers to get them <br/>
&gt; separate ones. I suspect it would be hard to get kids who currently <br/>
&gt; have their own book to adopt this though!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We don't have a perfect system  -- discussion about who's turn it <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; to do what can be frustrating - especially when I'm trying to bat <br/>
&gt; away the mosquitos!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lots of folks swear by Avon's Skin-So-Soft, but IMHO it repels people more <br/>
than skeeters. It definitely has a distinct odor, and makes you smellable <br/>
(Stinky!) to other people yards away. I feel the same way about citronella <br/>
repellents (gag!) When I worked at the nature center, all it took was one little camper <br/>
wearing citronella (Repel brand) to stink up the whole building for hours <br/>
after they left! Phew!<br/>
<br/>
Also, it is true that your body chemistry and your natural scent (and the way <br/>
those interact with chemical repellants) that will determine if the <br/>
mosquitoes or ticks will be attracted to you and if the repellent will work for you or <br/>
not. For some folks, nothing seems to work. For others, they never need to use <br/>
anything, because they just don't seem to be tasty to the skeeters.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn't heard about using Bounce sheets, but I will often brew up some <br/>
strong chamomile tea and put it in a spray bottle. It works pretty well for me (and <br/>
lightens my hair at the same time :-)<br/>

I had a funny experience with Bounce at the beach in NC.  I rubbed <br/>
it all over me and then took another one and tucked it in my <br/>
collar.  A couple of minutes later I felt a nasty 'squito bite on my <br/>
neck.  The little bleep-bleep bit me right through the Bounce! <br/>
<br/>
Guess Bounce doesn't work for me!  :-)  <br/>

Actually, if you don't wear any perfume, cologne, etc when hiking it <br/>
reduces the amount of times you get bit (deodorant is a must <br/>
though!). So next time you go, make your mate or hikin partner smell <br/>
pretty and they'll get all the skeeters!<br/>

try to lay their eggs they squish them because the deet softens their <br/>
