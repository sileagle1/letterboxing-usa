OK - I'm a relative newcomer to letterboxing. I think my count is <br/>
15F, give or take. Sadly, I've exchanged none as of yet. (Though I <br/>
hope to increase that number dramatically at the Mercer Meet in <br/>
Doylestown on the 28th of June. (shameless plug))<br/>
<br/>
Though I *have* been busy designing up a SIX box series for <br/>
placing this summer. I've told my son that I want to us to find <br/>
twenty boxes each before placing our first, so as to have a better <br/>
understanding on what makes a good box; regarding the quality <br/>
of carving, placement, and clues.<br/>
<br/>
Now - I've done the research needed to make my series an <br/>
interesting one, with a dramatic narrative that I hope will enmesh <br/>
the seekers as they follow the trail of the story. This week I hope <br/>
to begin carving two of the stamps, as I've completed the <br/>
storyline of the first two locations. Placing the series two at a <br/>
time seems a good idea, and I should have all six completed by <br/>
the Autumnal Equinox.<br/>
<br/>
Here, I pose a question. <br/>
<br/>
After roughly two months of weekend excursions to find <br/>
letterboxes - Periodic forays into the woods to scout new <br/>
locations - And hours of pouring over the list, reading of <br/>
everyone's else experiences .... Something happened:<br/>
<br/>
I had my first letterbox dream.<br/>
<br/>
It was vivid - and as lucid as any of my most powerful dreams <br/>
(that weren't sheet-clutching nightmares) I can remember. It had <br/>
a plot - it followed a timeline. The characters had motivations, <br/>
and developed as the dream progressed. It even had a suprise <br/>
ending!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, the only thing in the dream that bordered on the unreal, <br/>
was the fact that it was snowed throughout the course of it; and <br/>
we're currently enjoying a 90 degree heat wave here in Philly.<br/>
<br/>
I find myself wanting to  modify my series slightly in order to <br/>
incorporate some of the twists found in my dream series. If for <br/>
no other reason, than to document the dream in some way, <br/>
before it fades the way those singular dreams are wont to do.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had a Letterbox Dream that was particulary <br/>
unusual?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
     This is a preview of your life as a letterboxer! Dreams are just a part of <br/>
the total letterboxing experience. Be prepared to arrange vacations around <br/>
areas with the most letterboxes; you never will run an errand without first <br/>
checking to see if there is a box in the area; and you will eventually get your <br/>
best friends into boxing so that quality time with friends can also <br/>
produce "productive" time!!<br/>
<br/>
     Sounds like you have been bitten by the letterboxing bug - watch out - <br/>
it's addictive . . . but you will be healthier [walking, fresh air], you will <br/>
get closer to spouses,friends and family [quality time] and you will meet the <br/>
best bunch of people anywhere [gatherings and on the trail.] Glad to have you <br/>
join our ranks!!<br/>

Yeah - I dreamed that I'd solved Ray's Dilemma. Of course I hadn't really,<br/>
but it felt good for a few hours. Eventually we did solve the dilemma but<br/>
more by perseverance and good luck than good dreams.<br/>

That is so weird! I had a letterbox dream during my nap today ( I have three <br/>
kids aged 4 and under, don't ask!).  I dreamed that I was on a vacation to <br/>
Nevada with my entire family -- extended and all.  Everyone was so excited to see <br/>
Jay Leno there but I just wanted to find a computer so I could see where the <br/>
closest letterbox was.  Maybe I am reading too many e-mails? We also went to a <br/>
garden yesterday with a homeschool group and I have found the perfect place <br/>
for planting my first box! There are a lot of geocaches there already so I <br/>
don't think the people will mind me planting one.  I will ask first.  Everyone was <br/>
so busy looking at the flowers and trees and absorbing the info our wonderful <br/>
host was telling us and I just thought "maybe under that rock? Oh look! <br/>
There's a hole in that tree!" LOL Oh well, it was fun and my children saw ducks and <br/>
turtles. :-)<br/>
