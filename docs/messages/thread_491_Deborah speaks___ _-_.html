anyway, almost lone letterboxing pursuits.<br/>
  This is all an issue of control. Who's got it and<br/>
who wants it. I intensely dislike the site ultimatums and the<br/>
list coups and the "spy vs. spy" between sites issues. If we<br/>
don't take a stand against that we will end up with many <br/>
different sites and lists, and frankly, I don't intend to visit or join<br/>
many more. I don't have the time and I don't think it's necessary.<br/>
  What I'd like:<br/>
  I'd like us all to stop here. I'd like us to keep what we have and<br/>
work on it together. I would like there to be one site that is a <br/>
"by the letterboxer, for the letterboxer" site.  This means that <br/>
site and list owners would have to agree to a round table approach<br/>
and give up individual ownership. If that happens we will need some<br/>
kind of official organization and some rules about how to make<br/>
decisions and how to have discussions. For starters I'd suggest<br/>
a limit on how many days of discussion we have.... maybe a <br/>
statement and rebuttal once limit, and then utilize the poll<br/>
feature to decide issues. I think we've figured out how to use<br/>
that now. (and I lost! :-} ) <br/>
Here's to letterboxing, it will go on with us or without us, <br/>
(but I'd rather it was with...)<br/>

Thanks Deborah,<br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there with theory of organization books please dust off them off<br/>
and read page one.  I always wanted to be a college gradeeeeeate, now I are<br/>
one.....Yes, I agree the monster is starting to raise it's ugly head.  We<br/>
need as a "organization" to develop leadership, structure, security and<br/>
order.  I am a free person by myself but as a member of a group a natural<br/>
follower.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the bad news gang,  but internet or business or boy scout troop,<br/>
we aren't going to be able to reinvent the wheel here. I am leaving this<br/>
group to become a member of the fictious "realist" group forming in my mind.<br/>
Do I belong to something of is this just gravitation?<br/>
<br/>
I still believe in you guys and gals<br/>
