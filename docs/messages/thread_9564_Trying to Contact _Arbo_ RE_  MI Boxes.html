with a letterboxer named Arbo, who planted a couple of boxes in MI <br/>
earlier this year, although I don't think he is from here.<br/>
<br/>
The Muskegon Beach Box is still in place but has been missing its <br/>
stamp for a couple of months now.  The Pines Point box is believed to <br/>
be missing.<br/>
<br/>
The Muskegon Beach Box is in a great location at a nice park along <br/>
Lake Michigan.  As it is only a couple of miles from my house, I <br/>
would be happy to adopt this box and replace the stamp, but don't <br/>
want to step on anyone's toes if the owner is still interested in <br/>
maintaining the box.  If so, if you would like to send me a new <br/>
stamp, I can run out there and put it in the box.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what to do about Pines Point...  it is kind of remote and I <br/>
hate to see people drive all the way out there only to find the box <br/>
missing, but it is my understanding that boxes are only marked <br/>
as "missing" on the clues site if the owner reports them missing.<br/>
<br/>
Arbo, if you are reading this talk list, please contact me offline <br/>
about the Muskegon Beach Box.  Thanks!<br/>
