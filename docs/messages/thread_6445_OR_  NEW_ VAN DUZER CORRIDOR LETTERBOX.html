Grande Ronde and Lincoln City, Oregon.  It is located in Lincoln County.<br/>
There are two rest area/waysides to this park.  You want to go to the<br/>
one on the South side of the highway.  <br/>

CLUES:  Fairly easy.<br/>
<br/>
TERRAIN:  Dirt trail and soft, wet ground.  Not handicapped accessible,<br/>
unfortunately.  Dress for swamp-tromping.  The ground can be sloggy and<br/>
boggish at times.  Also, the occasional berry branch or burr may snag<br/>
you on the hunt, so keep that in mind. <br/>

Facing the Day Use/Dog Leash sign look to 140 degrees.  Go to this<br/>
picnic table.  From here look to 120 degrees and proceed to this picnic<br/>
table.  At 220 degrees there is a path about 25 steps away.  Head on<br/>
this trail.  Stay right and up from the creek.  If other paths lure you<br/>
toward H20 don't go there!  Always head right.  Go up and over some logs<br/>
and rocks and then down.  Approach a more clear area with a big tree<br/>
straight ahead.  The path fades and veers right.  When the tree is at<br/>
exactly 270 degrees cut across clearing at 300 degrees and 18 steps.  Go<br/>
9 steps at 260 degrees.  From here a bigger, different tree can be seen<br/>
at 170 degrees.  Around the outer base of this tree is the Van Duzer<br/>
Corridor Letterbox.<br/>
