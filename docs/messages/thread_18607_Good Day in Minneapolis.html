Having done some research prior to my trip, I knew where I wanted to go.<br/>
I managed to find 3 boxes at the Bass Ponds. All great finds by the way.<br/>
<br/>
Then I went in search of The Four Elements.<br/>
Got 'em all.  Great set of clues.<br/>
Awesome stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Deb Rocks gets my vote for carver of the year.<br/>
I was thinking of doing the Dan Brown ambigrams too, but after seeing how<br/>
well yours came out, I don't want to attempt it.<br/>
Great work!<br/>
<br/>
I did not see a stamp in the first book, but I may have missed it because I<br/>
was #2 in all the rest.<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

I must have been behind you all day! lol ( you were the first person <br/>
to stamp in at "air" unless I missed the first stamp-in, also!)<br/>
<br/>
Deb Rocks' stamps are beautiful, arn't they? I think I need to do a <br/>
LOT more carving after seeing hers. <br/>

Sorry I missed you.<br/>
Would have been nice to get an exchange from halfway across the country.<br/>
I'll be back.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Deb Rocks' stamps are something else.<br/>
If you haven't seen the Bass Ponds pair, check 'em out.<br/>
Even better than the Elements.<br/>
I may have to retire my Speedo tool set.<br/>
