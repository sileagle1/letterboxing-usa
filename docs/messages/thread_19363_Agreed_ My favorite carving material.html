was pretty forgiving.  I tried some of the "EZ-Cut" and it definately <br/>
was crumbly, so I shied away from it.  Once I got the hang of how to <br/>
mak ethinner lines and became more patient with creating stamps, I've <br/>
become less abstract in my designs.  As Nisha says, the stuff is <br/>
INexpensive, which makes errors less painful.<br/>

&gt; In reading about people searching for carving material I just need <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; throw in my two cents.<br/>
&gt; So far the best and cheapest carving material I have found comes <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; Dick Blick Art Supplies. I know that that they have store fronts<br/>
&gt; somewhere but I order through the web at dickblick.com<br/>
&gt; The carving material that I like is called Soft-Kut. It is about 1/4<br/>
&gt; inch thick grey rubber material that cuts really nice. Other stuff<br/>
&gt; that I have tried is too crumbly, except Speedball's pink stuff <br/>
which<br/>
&gt; isn't bad but pricey.   Soft-kut costs $1.29 for a 4x6 block or <br/>
$7.69<br/>
&gt; for a 12x18 block.  Dick Blick also sells carving tools, I prefer<br/>
&gt; speedball's wooden handle over the big industrial red one. The wood<br/>
&gt; seems a nicer size for carving small soft things like letterbox <br/>
stamps.<br/>
&gt; Also my favorite book on the subject is, The Weekend Crafter: Rubber<br/>
&gt; Stamp Carving: Techniques, Designs &amp; Projects<br/>
&gt; by Luann Udell<br/>
&gt; Happy Carving!<br/>
