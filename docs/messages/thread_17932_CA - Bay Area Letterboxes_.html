<br/>
Clan Jiggs hit the highway again last weekend in search of some boxes <br/>
in the SF Bay area! We were 7 for 7 (plus another Hitchhiker!) <br/>
although we really had to work hard to get one in particular!!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the breakdown - <br/>
<br/>
Mai Tais and Menehune - exactly where it was supposted to be - after <br/>
we translated the Hawai'ian int English!! (should have done that <br/>
before we visited the first time (Doh!!)<br/>
<br/>
Lunar New Year #1 - good condition with a fair amount of traffic - we <br/>
also picked up the Peace Meltdown HH (second time!!) so will move it <br/>
along soon!<br/>
<br/>
Lunar New Year #2 -really nice spot - the view accross the bay <br/>
towards the Golden Gate is gorgeous!<br/>
<br/>
Three Bridges (Geocache hybrid) - super spot with great view of the, <br/>
well,  bridges!!<br/>
<br/>
Crab Cove #1 - our perseverance LB of the day!  We found it buried <br/>
(I'm not kidding!!) under a 400lb concrete slab, as per the clues, <br/>
but it had been pushed so far back that I (6'2") could barely touch <br/>
it while lying on my (anple!!) belly!  The locals (and my wife) must <br/>
have thought I'd lost my mind when I started digging it out! A few <br/>
scrapes and some choice words later, the LB was ours!! I put some <br/>
large rocks into the hole to rbsure the box doesn't get crammed in <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Crab Cove #2 -(Neptune Beach) - a MUCH easier box to find!<br/>
<br/>
Trials challenge - (geocache hybrid) - another great box with a fair <br/>
amount of LB traffic!<br/>
<br/>
We went after the Survivor Series, and actually found the park, but <br/>
time was a little short for this day.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to get those and the rest of AJ's Boxer family series next <br/>
weekend!<br/>
