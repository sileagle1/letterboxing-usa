visit "Postcard from Maine." While up on the paved path around the <br/>
SMTC campus, temps were almost pleasant--perhaps low 40s...but as <br/>
soon as we stepped down onto the sand, there was a light breeze off <br/>
the water that cut right through me. Brrr! Well, we turned back (I'm <br/>
a whuss), explored the fort and the beach on the lee of the <br/>
breakwater.  We then drove around the neighborhood to find a closer <br/>
place park to the LB, but, as it was very cold, and we couldn't get <br/>
very close without freezing, we decided to go back when the weather <br/>
warms up. I did come home with a handful of sea glass and shells.<br/>
