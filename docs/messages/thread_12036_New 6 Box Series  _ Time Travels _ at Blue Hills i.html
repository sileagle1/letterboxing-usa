<br/>
Stretching from Dedham to Quincy , Milton to Randolph , the Blue <br/>
Hills Reservation encompasses over 7000 acres , providing the largest <br/>
open space within 35 miles of Boston . More than 125 miles of trails <br/>
weave through the natural fabric of forest and ponds , hilltops and <br/>
wetlands . Hikers can count 22 hills in the Blue Hills chain with <br/>
Great Blue Hill noted as the highest landmark at 635 feet above sea <br/>
level . The reservation can be accessed from a number of locations , <br/>
but we recommend parking at either the Blues Hills Trailside Museum <br/>
which is located on Route 138 , 1/2 mile North of Route 93 , in <br/>
Milton , or at the Blue Hills Reservation Headquarters which is <br/>
located at 695 Hillside Street in Milton , 1/4 mile North of <br/>
Houghtons Pond , beside the State Police Station .<br/>
<br/>
 Trail maps are available ( $ 1 each ) at either of these locations <br/>
and you will definitely need one of these .<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to bring water and we highly recommend hiking boots . This is <br/>
a long trek over some rough terrain and you should allow for plenty <br/>
of day light . <br/>
<br/>
You will also need to do some prior research on the history of <br/>
England during the Middle Ages . <br/>
<br/>
Our stamps are based on illustrations found in the " Children's <br/>
Illustrated Edition " of H.G. Wells great book " The Time Machine " . <br/>
<br/>
Once at the reservation , crank up the WABAK Machine and set it for <br/>
the year that would make it possible to witness not only the battle <br/>
of " Stamford Bridge " but also Harold's crushing defeat at the " <br/>
Battle of Hastings " . Once there  take the trail leading off at 130 <br/>
degrees then take your first right and at the next main intersection <br/>
go right and then another quick right to take the trail heading <br/>
uphill at 230 degrees . After cresting the hill and  a sharp left <br/>
turn look for a large dead tree 15 paces off trail to your left ( If <br/>
you pass between two dead trees with a third lying parallel to the <br/>
trail at their feet , you have gone approximately 30 paces too <br/>
far ) . From this tree at a bearing of 33 degrees , past the waist <br/>
high stump , at the foot of the ledge , 6 feet from the large crack <br/>
on the left amongst the jumble of rocks find " Time Travelers <br/>
Return " .<br/>
<br/>
Next you will want to hurry to the correct year to stand in line to <br/>
get your highly prized signed copy of the first edition " Domesday <br/>
Survey Book " . Once you have secured this , take the path heading <br/>
off at 240 degrees and continue to head in a generally SW direction , <br/>
ignoring the first two intersections you will encounter . After this <br/>
the trail will start to level out and you will see a very large dead <br/>
tree on your right . A rough stone wall crosses the trail at this <br/>
point . 5 paces off trail in the down hill direction you will spot a <br/>
stone larger then those around it . At the off trail side of this <br/>
rock you will find " Into the Future " .<br/>
<br/>
Now rush off to pick up a tux and take part in the wedding of Matilda <br/>
to Emperor Henry V . From here you will want to take the trail <br/>
heading off to the Southwest and then a left at the first <br/>
intersection . At the next intersection take the trail leading off at <br/>
55 degrees . You will know it is the correct trail if you pass under <br/>
a fallen tree soon after entering it . Follow this trail until you <br/>
come to an intersection and then take the trail heading at 325 <br/>
degrees . You will come to a " T " intersection , when here , look to <br/>
your left and you will see a large , fallen , but suspended tree . At <br/>
its base under rocks and bark you can find the home of the lovely " <br/>
Weena " .<br/>
<br/>
Visit but don't stay too long with Henry I . Be sure to grab a place <br/>
in the life boats to avoid Henry's fate aboard the " White Ship " . <br/>

Now the hard part... motivating my family. I'm starting to think we <br/>

&gt; Visit but don't stay too long with Henry I . Be sure to grab a <br/>
place <br/>
&gt; in the life boats to avoid Henry's fate aboard the " White Ship " . <br/>
&gt; From this spot take the trail leading off at 150 degrees and then <br/>
&gt; take a left at the next intersection . Go straight thru the <br/>
following <br/>
&gt; intersection and then you want to bear right at the next " T " . <br/>
&gt; Start to look for a small path heading South on your right . Take <br/>
&gt; this trail , as it heads downhill look to your right for lone tall <br/>
&gt; pine with a Birch stump nearby . A large jagged rock with a smaller <br/>
&gt; pine atop it is near the base of this lone pine . Look at its SW <br/>
side <br/>
&gt; for " Morlock Holes " .<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Grab your slick sport coat and microphone to report on the <br/>
exhumation <br/>
&gt; of King Arthur and Guinevere from a grave at Glastonbury Abbey . <br/>
They <br/>
&gt; will probably want you to do a sidebar on Richard the First's <br/>
&gt; conquering of Cypress and capture of the city of Acre also . When <br/>
&gt; there take the path leading off at 250 degrees and take a left at <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; first intersection . At the next intersection you should see a <br/>
fenced <br/>
&gt; in area . Find the faint trail which starts to the left of the <br/>
this . <br/>
&gt; The trail leads up to the right behind and above the well like <br/>
&gt; structure enclosed by the fence , and will become more discernible <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; you follow it ( trust us it's there ) . At the first fork stay to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; left and then straight thru the next intersection . You will <br/>
&gt; eventually come to a rocky clearing with the radio tower clearly <br/>
seen <br/>
&gt; at 250 degrees . To the right of the path stands a lone 20 foot <br/>
&gt; Eastern White Pine . At its base lies a dark 6 foot long <br/>
rectangular <br/>
&gt; stone . At the end of this stone away from the tree , be on the <br/>
look <br/>
&gt; out for " Fiendish Things " .<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Obtain a quill and ink , then elbow your way to the front of the <br/>
line <br/>
&gt; to take part in the signing of the Magna Carta . Then follow the <br/>
main <br/>
&gt; trail heading South . You will come to a clearing , and there will <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; boulders to your right . Scramble to the top of the largest of <br/>
these <br/>
&gt; and look for a large outcropping of rock at 265 degrees which seems <br/>
&gt; to be cradling a tree . Three feet from this outcroppings North <br/>
side <br/>
&gt; is a large ground level rock with a trap door like over hang at its <br/>
&gt; South side . It is here you should look for  " Back to the Lab "<br/>

&gt; We hope you have enjoyed your visit to the Blue Hills !<br/>
