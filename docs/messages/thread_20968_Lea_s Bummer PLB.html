those of you who have had one of your precious boxes vandalized.  PrincessLea <br/>
not only had a box lost but the thief emailed her and said he'd put rocks in <br/>
the box and threw it into the nearby lake "har, har". She thought up the box, <br/>
Art Trekker carved the stamp and we are keeping the list and such.<br/>
<br/>
If you have had the misfortune of losing a box, send US your story and your <br/>
snail mail address and we'll put you on the list. When you get this very <br/>
lightweight box (envelope), email us and we'll give you the name and address of the <br/>
next person on the list.<br/>
<br/>
HURRY!!<br/>
