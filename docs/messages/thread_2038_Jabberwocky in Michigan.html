Nothing is left of where it had been placed but a bare riverbank. <br/>
I'll replace it in a new but close location soon. Too bad; I really <br/>
liked that stamp. I'll recreate it, though.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't been able to get to where River Bend is -- that one might <br/>
have survived the flood because it was well wedged in its location.<br/>

Everyone put your hand up who's lost a box this way...<br/>
<br/>
I placed a box along the Minnesota river last year.  When placing it,<br/>
I thought, "Hmmmm, it might flood here.  Maybe I should come back with<br/>
a line and tie it off to a tree."  Before I could come back (and<br/>
before I could ever post to the list), we had heavy rains and it<br/>
apparently went downriver.  I still have visions of scuba diving in<br/>
the Gulf and seeing it floating along.<br/>
<br/>
I'll get around to replacing it once the snow melts...<br/>

I may also have a "drifting" letterbox out there somewhere. My Wahkeena Falls <br/>
box aparently washed down the cliffside last winter.  I looked around below <br/>
to see if I might stumble across it, but I suspect it washed into the <br/>
Columbia River and is now out at sea somewhere. In the movies, the guy on the <br/>
stranded island always finds a message in a bottle... how about a plastic <br/>
box???<br/>
