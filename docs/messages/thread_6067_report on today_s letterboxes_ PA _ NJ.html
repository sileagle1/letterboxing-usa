                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a marathon day letterboxing afternoon; here's the report:<br/>
<br/>
  * Round Valley Reservoir, NJ -- the boat launch parking area was also <br/>
closed -- except if you were actually launching a boat. I don't know if <br/>
this is only a weekend circumstance or not, but I decided to try it again <br/>
some other time.<br/>
<br/>
  * Durham Furnace, Delaware Canal -- not found, and this was my second <br/>
attempt. I'll wager the box is there, but I have a mental block that's <br/>
causing me not to find it, since I got drenched in a rainstorm *and* got a <br/>
case of poison ivy last week when I tried to find that box.<br/>
<br/>
  * Shad Ladder, Delaware Canal -- the area around this box was sealed off <br/>
because of some police action, with yellow tape ("POLICE LINE, DO NOT <br/>
CROSS") blocking the canal tow path and nearby parking area. Probably just <br/>
a one-time event, scheduled to coincide with my letterboxing attempt. <g><br/>
<br/>
  * Ringing Rox Box #1, Bucks County, PA -- found in great shape. #2 has <br/>
already been reported missing, but I hiked down the hill to take a look for <br/>
myself and didn't turn it up (but I didn't spend too much time on it). The <br/>
stream is so dry right now that there's hardly more than a trickle, I don't <br/>
know if that's the usual condition or not, or if that would affect the clue.<br/>
<br/>
  * Fisherman's Point, Spruce Run State Park, NJ -- found the box in good <br/>
shape, though the parking lot referenced in the clue is closed on weekends. <br/>
There is alternative parking nearby, so it's not a major issue.<br/>
<br/>
  * Indigo Turtle, Delaware Canal, Erwinna, PA -- found in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
  * Fish in Outer Space #2 &amp; #3 (I already found #1 last week but it was <br/>
too dark to continue) -- both found in good shape. Another 'boxer had <br/>
stamped into #2 today, but not #3, so I wonder if our paths crossed?<br/>
<br/>
  * South Mountain #1 &amp; #2 -- found in good shape (it was too dark to <br/>
continue for #3, so I'll be back for that one).<br/>
