As the time nears, we're looking for a rough head count for the May 11<br/>
Gathering at Sleeping Giant State Park, in Hamden, CT. Jay has<br/>
graciously set up a site at:<br/>

We're also looking for some fun stuff to do at the picnic area, Bruce<br/>
would like to see a carving contest (I then suggested "secret" judges,<br/>

Hello. We are relatively new to letterboxing and I just saw a reference to<br/>
this gathering so wanted to find out more. It just says May 11 below. What<br/>
time are people gathering? We live in the Boston area and would like to<br/>
come.<br/>

hanging around all day. I'm going to try to find lime green and/or <br/>
bright orange tableclothes so that we'll be easily spotable. The <br/>
picnic is pot-luck, no set time. Since we're there early, we'll <br/>
probably bring something breakfast-ish. There are grills available <br/>
too, for those who wish to make themselves a hot lunch.<br/>
<br/>
I'll have some maps of the area for those who have already done the <br/>
Giant's boxes, though I have not printed up any clues. Nearby boxes <br/>
include those in New Haven, Woodbridge, Wallingford, Hamden, Cheshire, <br/>
and a little further out is Meriden, Durham, &amp; Branford.<br/>
<br/>
Butterfly Lady will be planting some new boxes in honor of the event <br/>
too. If you'd like a trail map to get the lay of the land beforehand, <br/>
it's available in pdf format at:  http://www.sgpa.org/trailmap.pdf<br/>
(to open pdf, you need Adobe Acrobat Reader, free at www.adobe.com)<br/>
<br/>
When you enter the park, you can drive up around the circle and park <br/>
or use the parking area on the right. If its raining we'll probably be <br/>
in the pavillion. There could be a $5 charge for parking, the rangers <br/>
have told me that it depends on staffing--if they don't have a <br/>
staffperson to sit in the booth, there is no charge that day.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!<br/>

P.S. Unfortunately, it's not a "Daddy weekend" so Erin (Chatterboxer) <br/>
will not be with us.<br/>

Probably shouldn't mention this, but just up the road from the park <br/>
on Rt 10(north) is THE BEST ice cream you will EVER eat at <br/>
Wentworth's.  I don't even really like ice cream, but this stuff is <br/>
in a whole different league.  Hand made and a maybe little pricey, <br/>
but amazing stuff.<br/>

So, someone wants an approximate headcount?<br/>

Dan (leader of Safari Men) and I plan to be at this event, but are not sure<br/>
at all at this point about arrival time.  We can't come Friday and camp<br/>
overnight but hope to camp Saturday night.  With any luck, Betz will be able<br/>
to go, too, but I haven't heard from her on this yet.<br/>

I will be going to the gathering at sleeping giant.  However, my <br/>
younger brother Jonathan (Eagleboxer2002) will be unavailable.  If <br/>
several people are camping overnight, I might just come and join you <br/>
all!  :)  Can't wait to see everyone. <br/>

<div>Hi</div>
<div>Being new to this hobby, we have never been to a 
gathering and my wife and I are curious as to what to make/bring. Is it set 
up as picnic?  Do we bring our own food? </div>
<div>We plan to get there in the morning to do some 
letterboxing, but I hope to meet some of you and learn more about 
letterboxing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My wife and I stumbled on to letterboxing in Feb 
and have enjoyed some really nice walks while seeking letterboxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>  We have not yet planted any, we do have 2 
set up and plan to plant this week in East Granby.</div>
<div><br/>See you all Saturday</div>
