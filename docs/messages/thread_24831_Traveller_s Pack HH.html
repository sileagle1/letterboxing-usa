                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello, I will be cross posting this with LB Travellers.  I found a HH <br/>
today.  The name on the bag says "Traveller's Pack HH", but I don't <br/>
know if this was the original name for this little guy.  The initial <br/>
entry on the journal says that it was "found at Bristol RenFaire on <br/>
9/7/2005 w/o a logbook".  The stamp is a handcarved image of a "hobo <br/>
pack".  You know, the little bundle on the end of a stick....<br/>
The log is so stuffed full that I would love to get in touch with <br/>
either the original owner or the one that started the new journal.  The <br/>
journal is simply a folded up piece of 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper inside <br/>
of a cute little blue envelope.  If this is your baby and you would <br/>
like to give me instructions as to what you would like me to do with <br/>
it, I would be more than happy.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Bethany<br/>
