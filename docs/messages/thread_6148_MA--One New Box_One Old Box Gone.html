<br/>
The Praying Woman of the Charles Letterbox, which was reported missing some<br/>
time ago, has definitely disappeared.  It is no more.  However, a brand-new<br/>
Massachusetts box, The Lakes of the Charles, is ready for visitors. The<br/>
clue follows.  It is also available at<br/>
http://users.crocker.com/~bsennott/womancharles.html.<br/>
<br/>
The Lakes of the Charles Letterbox <br/>
Newton, Massachusetts (Middlesex County) <br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS: From Route 128: Take the exit for Route 30. Turn onto Route 30<br/>
East. Pass the brown boathouse (Newton Canoe and Kayak Community Boat<br/>
Center) on the left, then make a U-turn, pass the boathouse now on your<br/>
right, go<br/>
over the river and turn right, following the boat rental parking and duck<br/>
feeding<br/>
signs.  Park in the lot by the river. (An alternative route: from Route 16,<br/>
take Route 30 west.) <br/>
<br/>
CLUE DIFFICULTY: Easy/Moderate <br/>
TERRAIN: Easy  <br/>
ESTABLISHED: July 2002 <br/>
<br/>
Caution: Some parts of the trail are right next to the river, which may<br/>
present<br/>
problems for small children and/or during the winter/spring months. <br/>
<br/>
CLUE: From the parking lot, carefully walk along the side of the road.  In<br/>
a couple<br/>
of minutes, at the Tow Zone sign, there will be stone steps heading down to<br/>
a trail<br/>
along the water.  Follow this trail as it hugs the waters edge.  When you<br/>
arrive at an intersection where you can go straight or right, go right<br/>
heading back towards the water.  Continue along.  At the next intersection,<br/>
you could go straight uphill, left or right.  Again go right.  Now when you<br/>
arrive at an Y, bear right.  Finally at the next intersection, you can go<br/>
straight-ahead, left or right.  Yet again, go right.  Count about 65-70<br/>
steps, you will see fallen white (birch) branches on both sides of the<br/>
trail and the remaining 3 ft. of the birch tree standing on the left. There<br/>
is also a low, large rock to the left of the trail. Take a couple steps and<br/>
turn left at the minor trail and head to the fallen tree.  Under rocks<br/>
along the trunk, you will find the letterbox. After you have stamped in and<br/>
enjoyed your view of the lakes of the Charles, you can walk another minute<br/>
to find the Norumbega Tower on the left.  Check out its inscription to find<br/>
out what Norumbega means and learn about the Norse history of the area.<br/>
Head back the way you came or very carefully along the road.  Visit with<br/>
the ducks by the parking area or rent a canoe or kayak, if its the season.<br/>
 The walk will take you 20-35 minutes to arrive at the letterbox.  <br/>
