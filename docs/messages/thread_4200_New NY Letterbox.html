<p>Wish Upon a Star Letterbox</p>
<p>Location: Schenectady County Nature and Historic Preserve, Glenville, New 
York</p>
<p>Placed: 12/27/01 by Ann T.</p>
<p>Difficulty: Easy (less than an hour hike)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Directions: Go North on Route 50 to Glenridge Road. Turn right on Glenridge 
and go 1.3 miles to traffic signal at Maple Avenue. Turn left, go 0.4 miles to 
parking lot on left at junction of Maple Avenue and Hetcheltown Road. Trail 
starts on the right side of the parking lot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>From the signboard at the trailhead, follow a trail through a young forest 
and down a slope to the valley of the Indian Kill. Cross the stream on a bridge 
built on an old dam. Bear right onto the red-marked trail (the Claire K. Schmitt 
Trail) that hugs the stream, following this trail up to a bluff. The trail makes 
a sharp (135 degree) turn right at the bluff. (An unmarked trail continues 
straight down the bluff to the stream below.) Find a heavily-carved beech tree 
at the vee of the trail. From here a bearing of 100 degrees points to a huge, 
triple-trunked silver maple. The letterbox is hidden between the trunks of the 
maple tree, about waist-high. Be careful, there’s a steep slope to get to the 
tree and it’s a long way down to the stream below. After stamping in be sure to 
conceal the box carefully. This looks like a place that might attract critters 
as well as adventurous kids. Continue your hike on the red trail. It will soon 
intersect with a yellow trail. Take the yellow trail south (left) back to the 
bridge over the old dam that you crossed before, and go back to your car the way 
you came in. (A map at the trailhead shows ways to lengthen your hike if you 
wish.) </p></div></body></html>

I have relatives that live up there and now I can take them out boxing next time I visit!  Do you go up there often?  I will have to place a box next time I'm in New York.  Maybe we start the craze in that area.<br/>

<div>Melissa,</div>
<div>    I was really surprised when I looked to see 
if there were any boxes up there before we headed up to Schenectady to visit 
friends for a day.  There didn't seem to be any anywhere! And there are so 
many places to put them up there.  We don't get there often, but as we 
lived in the Albany area for 6 years, we still have friends there.  
One of them took us to this park in Glenville.  He knew it well having 
taken lots of Boy Scouts there.  He said he'd keep an eye on the box for 
me.  Glad to hear someone will eventually get out there.  Let me know 
if you do...  Ann</div></body></html>
