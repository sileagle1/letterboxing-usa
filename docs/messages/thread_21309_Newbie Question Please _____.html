Hi Ho .... GeoGordie in Greensboro, NC<br/>
<br/>
Gathering up some goodies to put out in my First LB ... not many in my area it looks like.<br/>
<br/>
Question ... Is it standard fare for the person searching for the LB to bring their own Inked Stamp Pad? I don't think a pad would hold up very well with the cold weather we are in right now in the box I plan to put out.  Your thoughts please ....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>

Hi Gordon- <br/>
I'll tell you that I've stopped putting ink pads into the boxes I<br/>
place for numerous reasons, mostly because I live in Maine and it's<br/>
wicked cold! Ink pads are expensive and they also make a really icky<br/>
mess if they're not put back in a different bag from the logbook. I<br/>
think you're better off not putting one in with the box but if you're<br/>
really considerate you can suggest that the finder bring their own.<br/>
Nautilus is usually very nice that way - people get to know that none<br/>
of my boxes have ink anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Phyto <br/>

In Wisconsin I think everyone assumes there will NOT be a stamp pad in the<br/>
box.  We've found some markers in an indoor box, and I think one outdoor<br/>
box.  I also heard that there was a box in the area that had an orange ink<br/>
pad, but the combination of water &amp; ink followed by cold temperatures turned<br/>
the inside of the box into an orange popsicle!  Since it is standard to not<br/>
have ink in the boxes around here, no one bothers to mention it in their<br/>
clues.  We all carry around our own pads and markers as standard operating<br/>
procedure.  However the conventions in NC may be different...<br/>

I know in some areas it is more standard to always include a pad, and <br/>
I have heard a couple people complain about not being warned to bring <br/>
stamp pads.  Out here though, there are only a couple boxes I can <br/>
think of that have stamp pads--my earliest ones from the days that I <br/>
was determined to have everything possible to make a perfect <br/>
letterbox.  I soon learned that just the notepads and rubbermaid I <br/>
liked were costing a lot of money since I like to carve stamps for <br/>
planting.  I also didn't like dealing with ink in freezing cold temps <br/>
that we have here for the majority of the year.  I soon gave stamp <br/>
pads up after realizing that nobody in this area includes them.  <br/>
<br/>
I stopped warning people to bring pads after a while too for the same <br/>
reason.  I always carry ink pads, others can do the same.  I don't <br/>
think we should assume there will always be ink for us.  Even if <br/>
there is, it is so often dried up.<br/>

I always thought that keeping the inkpads under the coats would be a <br/>
great way to keep them from freezing up.  I ahve not yet tried it, <br/>
but thanks for field testing!<br/>

Sporting Goods type store usually carry one-time use  - disposable  Hand Warmers.<br/>
Chemical base heat activation .. once opened from the sealed package and exposed to air .. it starts to heat up. Lasts up to  4 - 6 hours ... your mileage may vary.<br/>
Being an avid GeoCacher .. getting my feet wet in LB'ing .. I can say from personal use that they do work and are very helpful on cold, windy days. Especially since you most likley will have your gloves off during the log / stampimg process. Put your hands back in the coat pocket with the Hand Warmer in place .. nice finger warm up.  Has worked for me in some of the  North Carolina "cool days" recently.<br/>

Keeps the ink the warmest and I need to take the mittens off anyway to stamp<br/>
in.  (Yes, we can say we're obsessed!)<br/>

Except then you have to open the coat somewhat to get the pad out, letting<br/>
in arctic air!!  And stamping in with frozen fingers was not a thrill<br/>
either, lol.  Can we say obsessed??<br/>

&gt; I always thought that keeping the inkpads under the coats would be a<br/>
&gt; great way to keep them from freezing up.  I ahve not yet tried it,<br/>
&gt; but thanks for field testing!<br/>
