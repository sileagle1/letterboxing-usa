<p>Howlin at the Moon</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By team Puppylover</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Location: Michigan</p>
<p>County: Lapeer</p>
<p>Difficulty: Terrain is hilly!!! WATCH FOR HORSES</p>
<p>Starting point: Ortonville Recreation Area (17 miles south of Flint, 9 
miles north of I-75)</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Directions: Take M-15 North to Oakwood road then turn right. Follow 
Oakwood Road for several miles until you get to Hadley Road and turn left 
(North). Follow Hadley Road to Fox Lake Road; look for the horse camp signs. 
Turn left on to Fox Lake Road and take it until you reach Honert Road. At this 
point Fox Lake Road becomes a one-lane dirt road. Continue on the one-lane road 
to a parking spot designated by the clues.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>NOTE: Pets are welcome, but they should be on leash. This area is highly 
used by horseback riders, so please be aware! Also, be prepared to hike making 
sure to bring water, etc..</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Clues: </p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>To start on the path one must first find the land where trees act as 
ladders. The angle of the moon, 320 degrees, makes it almost full, but sometimes 
the yellow color of earthly bound satellites can draw ones eye from the task at 
hand. Dont be distracted by such feeble endeavors, your prize awaits past the 
green sky above.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>In your quest you will encounter 3 wise men standing tall and brave 
against the flow. Pass them by, but heed their suggestion of 300 rubles does 
bring thou riches. Be steadfast in your determination through the ups and the 
downs, and when your path does make two, choose wisely and stay to the left of 
center. Be ever watchful of the insight of the fallen sentinel of the night, 
usually found standing tall and right. Again the choice will be this or that and 
at that spot follow the 180 course straight and true.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>If you are on your destiny this night, 3 old friends will show their 
might. It seems they have beat you here, oh but never fear for they are friend 
not foe and are placed to show you the way to go.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Ask the wisest of the three, oh which way should I carry me. His answer 
bold and true is to stand and face the light shining at 130 degrees this night. 
Once youre in line to see the spectacle that awaits, 20 heeltoe steps you must 
make. It is here you will end your quest, finding what you seek huddled in the 
safety of the meek.</p>
