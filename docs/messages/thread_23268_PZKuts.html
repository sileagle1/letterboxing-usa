&gt;  Dear Letterboxers of North America, <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of your members, known by the name of Der Mad Stamper, has <br/>
employed my services to solve what he claims to be a "most atrocious <br/>
crime". One of your members has confiscated what he calls "a <br/>
valuable commodity", white PZKut, belonging to this individual. My <br/>
client, Der Mad Stamper, has offered a large reward in the <br/>
apprehension of this devious crook. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Der Mad Stamper has informed me that you are a close-knit <br/>
community and would be of much assistance in my investigation. <br/>
Having no understanding of your hobby I am not quite sure what the <br/>
big deal is over an item called PZKut. However, I have been hired to <br/>
solve the crime, and solve I will. I will search the whole continent <br/>
to discover who and why this senseless act has perpetrated upon my <br/>
client. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only name I have discovered thus far in the course of my <br/>
investigation is that of a Don &amp; Gwen. The last name does not seem <br/>
to be available to me. Does anyone have knowledge of these <br/>
individuals and who they might be? Rumor has it that Don has a <br/>
history of run-ins with others. Have you any knowledge of a past <br/>
history of wicked deeds by this so called duo? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely, <br/>
&gt; Investigator Francis Bacon <br/>
