<br/>
I'm not really sure it would be that much of an advantage since clues<br/>
are typically hosted in one place or the other. So even if one site<br/>
was working but the other wasn't, as soon as you clicked on the "view<br/>
clue" to the other site, the link wouldn't work.<br/>
<br/>
Though, I suppose, at least with one site running at all times, at<br/>
least *some* clues would always be accessible rather than none at all.<br/>
Hmm.... I had been thinking of moving AQ off of a shared server<br/>
anyhow. That might be another reason to do so.<br/>
<br/>
In other news--it never hurts to have a few clues already printed out<br/>
for those times when LbNA and/or AQ are inaccessible. ;o) Certainly<br/>
don't have to print out all of them, but printing out clues you expect<br/>
to use for the next week or so would solve a lot of problems. OR--you<br/>
can plant boxes instead. =) And for those people who host clues on<br/>
their personal sites, there's always that option. Googling often works<br/>
will if you already know the name of the boxes you're interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>

I did that last night, out of desperation.   And I found a box I hadn't know <br/>

I use that method already and have found it works well,  it helps me <br/>

There is that option too!<br/>
