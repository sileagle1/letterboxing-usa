The LBNA yahoo group works on first post moderation in order to keep <br/>
the list (hopefully) spam free, and to make sure that nobody joins <br/>
the group just to fire off some mean and nasty message to someone.  <br/>
Therefore if you are new to the group, your first post has to be <br/>
approved by one of the moderators.  We try to keep up on it, but as <br/>
you can imagine with such a large list sometimes it takes us a <br/>
little while to read everything and approve everything.  All of your <br/>
posts pile up for approval until your first one has been approved, <br/>
after that you will have no problems posting to the group.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this answered some of your questions,<br/>

Can you explian why lately posts have occasionalyl built up over several days before hitting the list? These are not from new subscribers either. I just deleted some the posted today that were dated the 18th. I've only noticed this is the past few weeks, and it doesn't seem to happen all of the time. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Alright Irene, <br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, figuring out what was <br/>
going on to be able to explain it took a bit of time for me and <br/>
Iron`Bear.  So here is my best explanation of what is going on.   <br/>
The LBNA Group has first post moderation in an effort to try and <br/>
keep the list free of SPAM, inappropriate stuff (like the adult <br/>
website advertisements) and to try and keep people from logging in <br/>
and firing off a flame war from go. <br/>
<br/>
With that first post moderation, we the moderators have to literally <br/>
go in and approve all the posts from first time users.  In addition <br/>
to that we also have to change their status on the list from <br/>
moderated to un-moderated.  Here is where I think the issue lays.  <br/>
<br/>
For those that don't know there are only four moderators in a group <br/>
of 1600 listed members. Now while all of those members may not <br/>
be "legitimate" members, they are listed members.  That is a lot of <br/>
members. When we are seeing sometimes 30-40 posts a day, it gets <br/>
hard sometimes to approve the posts (which means reading each one <br/>
first) and then changing their status to un-moderated.<br/>
<br/>
So here is what I will do to try and help improve the situation.  <br/>
For anyone out there that is currently posting messages to the board <br/>
that you feel are delayed due to moderation please contact the <br/>
moderators directly at letterbox-usa-owner@yahoogroups.com or feel <br/>
free to contact me directly at hispandora@phlsystems.com and I will <br/>
change your moderation status as soon as possible.  Other than that, <br/>
I will continue to attempt to keep up on changing the moderation <br/>
status on each member as they post and hopefully we will catch up <br/>
over the course of the next several weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this has answered your questions and proves to improve things <br/>
here on the LBNA list.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you well,<br/>

<br/>
And I, for one, fully appreciate the work involved in keeping up such <br/>
a list!  I'm the owner of several others and it can quickly take <br/>
control of what little free time you still have left.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
My problem seems to be fixed now!  Thank you, ALL of you, to those <br/>
who maintain this list and the website, and to all of you who <br/>
contribute to the conversations here.  Having a spam free world in <br/>
which to visit is priceless and I am thankful for the time you spend <br/>
making it that way.<br/>

Thanks so much for the explanation, it was very easy to understand the way you explained it. PLEASE!!! Do not think I was complaining!! I certainly wasn't. You guys do a great job and I enjoy the list very much. I was just curious as to why it happened sometimes but not all the time. Now I understand. Thanks again for taking the time to explain,<br/>
