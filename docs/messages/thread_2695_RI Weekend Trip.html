&gt;   One, for the Kurdziels (sorry if I spelled it wrong :( ), the Minimalist Series was the most fun I've had searching for boxes.  I've never been so anxious to see if I guessed the next one right.  They were all hilarious.  If anyone had been entering the park when I was leaving, they probably would have thought twice when they saw me leaving, grinning ear to ear.  Also, the box in South Kingstown at the treaty rock, I think might be missing.  I was pretty sure I had the right place (there really weren't too many rocks to choose from).  <br/>
<br/>
 Glad that you enjoyed Minimalist.  It was lots of fun to think up and my husband and I have discussed making a new set of boxes each year on April Fools Day.  As for "Vikings" I will have to check it out.  It has been reported missing before but was just so far under the rock that you needed a LONG stick.  If it is that will make my third box reported MIA in a few weeks : (<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And one general question.  On my way to Portsmouth from Jamestown, I saw a sign for the Green Animals Topiary Gardens.  I think that would be a great place for a box.<br/>
<br/>
I have often thought of putting a  box there but it is owned by the Newport Historical Society and there is a stiff entrance fee.  If you are visiting some of Newport's famous mansions you can get a pass that includes the Topiary Gardens.  The other place that I think would make a great site is the Rose Island Lighthouse but it requires taking a ferry.  I personally think that taking the ferry is a great way to enjoy Narragansett Bay and see one of the finest lighthouses in RI but it is also expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any ideas about putting LBs in locales that require an entrance fee?  IMHO if the fee is small and/or the locale is a destination in itself then it's no big deal.  The above two would be approx.. $8 - 10 each but are worth doing once.<br/>
