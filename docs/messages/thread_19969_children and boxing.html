 I thought others might have done this with a group of small children and <br/>
&gt; would have some input.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
Well, I can't say I do this with a group of small children, but most<br/>
every time I go boxing is with my two and a half year old daughter. I<br/>
think it sounds like a great idea, and as far as any suggestions,<br/>
maybe your could make a box in honor of the birthday, and have them<br/>
search for that as well. the only other thing I suggest is washable<br/>
ink if at all possible, my daughter has ruined some pants with other<br/>
inks, and washable is easier to get off little hands too. Good luck,<br/>
it sounds like a blast!<br/>

because of an article in Time magazine! What fun! We have found 2 <br/>
boxes so far. Well, techically three, but the third was missing. We <br/>

You see, every year for the past 12 years, I've hidden my children's <br/>
and my husband's Christmas presents and made them follow clues to <br/>
find them. (Now you see why we like letterboxing!) By age 1, my <br/>
children have had to solve some kind of clue, whether it was a <br/>
Polaroid picture of a place, a cut up computer generated picture, or <br/>
something more complicated as they got older. There are lots of ways <br/>
to do this in your own yard or nearby playground for even the <br/>
youngest participants. I also don't think that using an established <br/>
box would be very much fun for the kids. The clues are made for <br/>
grown-ups, or at least good readers. Four-year-olds are still <br/>
picture oriented and would do better with picture clues. Oh, and at <br/>
that age, they generally aren't good at finding things that are well <br/>
hidden. They need to see it. Just my input.<br/>

Oh, and Thank You everyone for the great boxes all over Florida! <br/>
