only means that the planter has not taken responsibility for <br/>
the box on the website. They may or may not still be maintaining <br/>
the box. In the previous incarnation of the website it was not <br/>
necessary for someone to be responsible for each box and a <br/>
tremendous load fell on the webmasters. Now they have set it up <br/>
so that someone must be responsible to answer questions that <br/>
come up about a box. If a placer doesn't know about the changes <br/>
on the site or doesn't want to fulfill that requirement the box <br/>
is listed as abandoned. <br/>
<br/>
For a micro- or mini-box you will definately want to take along <br/>
a pen, stamp pad, and a SMALL stamp. The logbook will be small <br/>
so there probably won't be room for a large stamp.<br/>

<br/>
My understanding is that an abandoned box is one that the planter <br/>
can't check on after it is planted.... such as one that was planted <br/>
on a vacation and is far from the planter's home... or possibly one <br/>
that was planted by a letterboxer who is no longer involved in the <br/>
sport. Sometimes these boxes are 'adopted' by another letterboxer <br/>
who lives nearby, and doesn't mind checking regularly and taking <br/>
care of any box maintanence needed.<br/>
<br/>
As for the micro letterboxes, as far as I know, film cannisters <br/>
qualify. Also, I have seen Altoid boxes discussed as micros, <br/>
although there is some hesitancy in using those because, of <br/>
themselves, they are not waterproof. <br/>
<br/>
I have quite a few letterboxes waiting to be planted and the <br/>
majority of them are micros in film cannisters. I am also a <br/>
scrapbooker, so use LOTS of film, and rarely throw away a film <br/>
cannister! LOL! I made my logbooks for these canisters long and just <br/>
slightly narrower than the cannister is tall - about 1 1/2" wide and <br/>
5 1/2 " long. I coil up the log book around the small information <br/>
paper and the small box stamp and put it all in the cannister. Then <br/>
I use strong mailing tape around the cannister (avoiding the lid, of <br/>
course) to attach the little identification etc. label. It works <br/>
pretty well. I am in South Texas, where there are not that many <br/>
letterboxers so I think my little logbooks inside the cannisters, <br/>
which will hold about 15-30 signatures will last a long time.<br/>
