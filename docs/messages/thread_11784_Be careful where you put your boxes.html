I couldn't agree with you more.  One of the parks where I placed a <br/>
series of several boxes requested that hikers stay on trail, so I had <br/>
no choice but to place the boxes trailside.  I found I had more fun <br/>
writing innovative clues of how to get to the precise place along the <br/>
trail, than trying to make the actual hiding spot hidden deep off the <br/>
trail.  And it wasn't nearly so hard to find hiding spots right along <br/>
the trail as I expected it might be.  The series of 9 boxes have all <br/>
been in place since late summer/early fall last year and none have <br/>
disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
I like challenging clues; I like clues that make me think or use <br/>
logic; I like clues that are somewhat ambiguous as to starting point <br/>
or which fork in the path to take, etc.  But it always bothers me <br/>
when I have reached the end of the clues and they are still so vague <br/>
that I have absolutely no idea if I am at the right place, let alone <br/>
where I might find the box at this point.  I once let a box go when a <br/>
few passes through the fallen leaves with my foot, a peek under <br/>
nearby rocks and into hollow stumps and tree crooks yielded nothing.  <br/>
It was probably there, but how far do you go in disturbing the <br/>
surroundings to find it?<br/>
<br/>
As this hobby continues to grow, and more and more boxes are hidden <br/>
out in the woods and parks, I think it becomes increasingly important <br/>
to be good stewards of the environment.  This includes being careful <br/>
of where to hide and where not to hide a box, and also choosing <br/>
places out of flood plains, etc.  Someone had a very good point the <br/>
other day -- A letterbox is a letterbox when it is safe in its hiding <br/>
spot, but when it is washed away in spring floods or dragged off into <br/>
the woods by innocent critters, it becomes litter.  And as I imagine <br/>
was the case in the situation you mentioned, different seasons <br/>
provide different environments in the woods.  What looks like just <br/>
bare ground with a cover of fallen leaves in the summer or fall could <br/>
very easily be haven for trout lilies or trillium in the spring.<br/>

Hi Crickets!  Thanks for an important heads up!  You may want to let the box <br/>
planter know so they can move the box.  I know if it were ours -- we would <br/>
want to know!  We try to be very careful (especially in places like <br/>
Meadowlark Gardens which specialize in all different kinds of flowers and <br/>
plants)  The only places we go off trail to any degree are ye ole woods near <br/>
playgrounds etc.  But, there could be plants there too!  I think it would be <br/>
a service to let people know on the list if we find a box in a less than <br/>
optimum location. Just our thoughts!  BeMa<br/>
