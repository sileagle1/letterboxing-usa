<div>Hello to everyone out there in letterbox land!</div>
<div>We went on a great little walk today in New London.  We found the 
Science of Letterboxing box.  The hike was easy, with lots of tiny wood 
frogs along the path.</div>
<div>The clues were really fun to figure out, they were science trivial 
questions which when answered directed you down the right path.  Lots of 
fun!  We were really surprised to see that the only other visitors were the 
Drews.  We thought we would let local letterboxers know about this hike, 
since the clues are only available at EMS and not on the internet.  We 
would recommend this box to anyone looking for a nice level walk, especially 
those with children.  We took the kids that we watch every now and then, 
they had a blast (but they always love letterboxing).  Well, hope a few 
more of you check it out.</div>
