                    <div class="plaintext-content">The LB at Crab Cove is very wheelchair accessible.  Jim didn't want <br/>
to go with me because he was watching a baseball game.  This was <br/>
Sunday, 8/24.  These LBs were right in our own backyard; I walked <br/>
over.  <br/>
<br/>
But, Jim would have been able to get all the way to the LB <br/>
location.  He would't have been able to uncover the box &amp; pick it <br/>
up; someone else would have to do that.  But this was a very <br/>
accessible location.  there is even a wheelchair accessible path of <br/>
travel through a tide pool area; accessible if the tide is out.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
The other nearby LB location near a duck pond was more difficult.  I <br/>
didn't want to try balancing to walk on a concrete wall extending <br/>
into the pond.<br/>
<br/>
At the 1st site at Crab Cove, met a family who was LBing;  1st time <br/>
I've met other boxers.  The mom &amp; kids did go over the concret wall, <br/>
down, &amp; up again, &amp; onto a path.  But, they couldn't find the <br/>
box.   :(<br/>
<br/>
This is a great hobby for families.  Different members of a family <br/>
will have different interests &amp; skills.  They can each use their own <br/>
skills for an interesting family outing.  In this case, the younger <br/>
kids is the rubber stamp maker in the family.  Neat turtles, snails, <br/>
etc.<br/>
(I'm not sure my notes are getting through.  I apolgize if this is a <br/>
duplicate.)<br/>
BTW, I'm probably one of the persons who sends messages that don't <br/>
follow the rules sometimes.  I had a stroke (brust cerebral <br/>
aneurysm) in 1987, with brain impairment.<br/>
