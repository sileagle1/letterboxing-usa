letterboxing in Oregon and Washington. My main interest is if there are<br/>
other resources for the pacific NW. I have asked around at a few local<br/>
outdoor stores (GI Joes and REI) but they all seemed a little confused by<br/>
the whole concept. Was I asking the wrong person or is letterboxing a small<br/>
time thing out here?<br/>

<br/>
Which box did you find first?  To get more clues go to<br/>
www.letterboxing.org and then click on the big red book, then click on<br/>
the state you want the clues for, then what section of the state, etc.,<br/>
etc.  You'll get the idea once you get into the clues section.  Also,<br/>
you can check the "What's New" section of the web sight for more<br/>
recently-placed letterboxes.  The Talk List Archives have letterboxes<br/>
sometimes that have been placed, but may not have gotten into the<br/>
aforementioned categories.  We have great webmasters that take very good<br/>
care of us with this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
There are a bunch of letterboxes now in Oregon and Washington so you<br/>
won't be deprived if you want to get out there and find them!  The past<br/>
year a number of new and interesting people in the Pacific NW have<br/>
jumped on the letterboxing bandwagon and it's been terrific!  <br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to ask any questions.  Letterboxing is really fun!!! <br/>
<br/>

Amanda. My first find was Pooch Place, founded by derMadStamper. Its an<br/>

I found out about letterboxing due to my roomates GPS actually. He got one<br/>
for his birthday and so we started Geocaching. Tabor and Ryan seem intent on<br/>
the geochaching idea, but it just seems to easy or somthing to me. There<br/>
isnt a lot of challenge to it. The geocaching web site had a link to<br/>
Letterboxing.org and so on and so forth. Today im either going to take a jab<br/>
at the PCC Rock creek boxes or the Twins. It will most likely be the twins<br/>
unless i somehow can figure out the last question in "the test"<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to the world of letterboxing!  =)  There's quite a large <br/>
number of them in the Portland area compared to most parts of the <br/>
country, although there's still not enough of them if you ask me.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I have it under good authority that a few letterboxers will be <br/>
out hunting for the elusive Blue Lake box <br/>
(http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/bluelake.htm) in the Portland <br/>
area on the 8th.  Many of us have tried and failed at this box, and <br/>
under the theory that six or seven heads are better than one, they'll <br/>
be a bunch of us running amoke and looking suspicious while looking <br/>
for the box.  Perhaps you can drop by and help, too!  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I found out about letterboxing due to my roomates GPS actually. <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is more virsitile than geocaching anyhow.  There are <br/>
letterboxes (not geocaches, but real, honest-to-goodness <br/>
letterboxes!) that require the use of a GPS.  The Brown's Camp <br/>
letterbox is a good example <br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.org/or/brncamp1.htm).  So we can <br/>
use "geocaching" clues, but they can't use "letterboxing" clues.  So <br/>
we've got them beat.  =)  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Tabor and Ryan seem intent on the geochaching idea<br/>
<br/>
I'd just like to point out to everyone that I'm not the Ryan in this <br/>
statement--just in case some of you thought I was into geocaching.  <br/>
=)  I don't even have a GPS!  (Which is probably one reason I've <br/>
never tried looking for that Brown's Camp letterbox.)<br/>
