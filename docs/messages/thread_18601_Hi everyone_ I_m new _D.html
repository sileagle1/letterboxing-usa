<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing may it prove to be a grand form of enjoyment <br/>
and recreation as it has for many of us. In my opinion you're <br/>
absolutely correct, your mark and they way you leave your mark are <br/>
very important. You seem to desire to have your stamp mean something <br/>
to you, a symbol of who you are as well as the type of person that <br/>
you are. Therefore this is what I would suggest. Is there anything <br/>
that you really love, such as an animal of a particular type, a <br/>
sport, a flower, a bird, something of that nature? If you do decide <br/>
and what you want to incorporate into your stamp then what I would <br/>
do is go to www.google.com and type in what you are looking for. <br/>
Example: Bear. Once it has completed your search if you look at the <br/>
top of the page it will have a hyperlink that says "Images" select <br/>
that and the page that will follow will be nothing but pictures of <br/>
what you are searching for and might prove to be very helpful in <br/>
assisting you to make a final decision on what else you want your <br/>
stamp-mark to represent. <br/>
<br/>
Once again welcome to letterboxing, and may your journey bring you <br/>
many adventures. <br/>

<br/>
 From one newbie to another, a few suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
The whole idea of carving my own stamp sounded so intimidating to me. <br/>
I'm not a "crafty" kind of person at all. But then I tried it, and it <br/>
was fun! I used an exacto knife on an eraser, and it turned out to be <br/>
much easier than I thought (yes, it really is!). I was surprised to be <br/>
able to carve some pretty fine details, including lines just a bit <br/>
thicker than an pencil line. Try a simple one to practice on first. And <br/>
remember, if you mess up, it's just an eraser!<br/>
<br/>
I've carved a signature stamp for myself and one for my son (he drew <br/>
the design, but he's not old enough to be using the exacto knife yet). <br/>
I've also carved another that I plan to place in a letterbox soon, and <br/>
I have a "waiting list" of designs I want to carve now--it's addicting!<br/>
<br/>
If you want to browse possible designs that are easy to copy, check out <br/>
the clip art books at your local bookstore or art store. There are <br/>
collections of clip art based on just about any theme you can think of.<br/>
<br/>
I (like others on this list) prefer the hot iron transfer method. I <br/>
tried the nail-remover method, and it worked, but the details were a <br/>
little fuzzy. The iron method yields a sharp, exact replica.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
