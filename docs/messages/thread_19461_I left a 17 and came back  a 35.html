<br/>
I printed out about 30 or 40 possible letterboxes in IL, IN, NY, PA, VA, DC, TN, AR &amp; OK.  We actually got to do 18 of them which was pretty good I thought and somewhat excessive my husband thought.  I went with my parents who are at about f75 and p30, so they enjoyed it.  Towards the end my children were begging, no more letterboxing!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it really added to our trip and we certainly saw thing we wouldn't have otherwise which is what I love.  <br/>
