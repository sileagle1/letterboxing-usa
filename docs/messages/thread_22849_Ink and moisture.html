  closely; it was a tri-colored pigment ink.  I used it a few times in the<br/>
  summer months.  I can see it being messy, especially if the last finder<br/>
  does not clean off the stamp adequately for the next finder.  This would<br/>
  explain why fine details could easily be lost.  Scrapbookers and ink<br/>
  specialists, please add your two cents on this one.  <br/>
<br/>
  In one of my logbooks I used regular copy paper and the ink on some of the<br/>
  entries did bleed through.  I don't know what ink was used, maybe the<br/>
  "chalk" type.  The letterbox container was pretty tight, so I don't think<br/>
  moisture was a contributing factor.  The ink dye stamps didn't run or<br/>
  fade.  The dry time on pigment inks is probably longer and, if not<br/>
  completely dry, I can see that causing a mess.<br/>
<br/>
  I changed my sig stamp this year and I now use a archival ink (sepia<br/>
  tone).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've used these in most of the boxes I've planted. I usually leave them loose in the box as a <br/>
first line of defense, rather than in the bags. One of my boxes in Florida got as many as I <br/>
had in my toolbox at the time (6-8).<br/>
<br/>
The key thing with these desiccant packs is that they absorb moisture from the air, that is, <br/>
water vapor. They do not absorb liquid! They're good for preventing condensation inside <br/>
your box before it starts, but there are still limits.<br/>
<br/>
Also, they have a tendency to get smelly if used in very very humid climates!<br/>
<br/>
An emergency flooding prevention option I've seen discussed is the crystalline kitty litter. <br/>
That stuff will absorb large amounts of liquid... and keep your litterboxes... oops, I mean <br/>
LETTERboxes... nice and fresh!<br/>
