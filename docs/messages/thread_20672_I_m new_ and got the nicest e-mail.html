I've been lurking for a few weeks being a new letterboxer in Northern <br/>
Illinois.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, after placing my first box last week, it was just found by <br/>
it's first finder.  They sent me the absolute nicest e-mail ever <br/>
telling me how much they liked the experience and the stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
Are you all so nice to newbies like me?  <br/>
<br/>
My kids and I are just having a ball with this, and already have some <br/>
great ideas for placing more boxes.  After this lovely encouragement, <br/>
I really cannot wait!<br/>

Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
Welcome and thanks for placing.  You may be interested, if you haven't <br/>
already discovered us, in the Great Lakes Regional letterboxing group.  The <br/>
URL is http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/<br/>
<br/>
This group will keep you informed of local events and site reports.  Some <br/>
clues are even posted there before they make it onto the big board. There are <br/>
lots of us in northern Illinois, so the more the merrier.<br/>
<br/>
BTW which is your new box?<br/>
<br/>
