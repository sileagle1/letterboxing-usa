Oh my, such indelicate adjectives being brandied about on this list <br/>
just causes my blood pressure to rise. Such insensitivity towards <br/>
those who are less than physically fit or could be considered <br/>
intelligently challenged is certainly uncalled for. I ask that <br/>
anyone who would use such politically incorrect terms as "stupid" <br/>
or "lazy" refrain from such profanity. It certainly meets the <br/>
requirements of moderation as unfit for children - goodness, my poor <br/>
darlings have been subjected to such cruel brutality. I think that I <br/>
will have to re-consider my membership on this list if this is the <br/>
type of language that is allowed to be used here.<br/>
<br/>
I am a former student of the elegant Lady Prisspot and take offense <br/>
at the lack of manners displayed by the Letterboxing community that <br/>
I once held as model for society. <br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, I will soon have the opportunity to find comfort in the <br/>
arms of my dear, dear former teacher,  Lady Prisspot.<br/>
<br/>
Faintly yours, <br/>
<br/>
