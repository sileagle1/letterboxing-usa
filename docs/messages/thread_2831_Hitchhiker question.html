<div>I place my HHer stamp in 
one zip-lock and then place it into the zip-lock holding it's logbook.  
This bag within a bag becomes the HH and goes into  what every box you 
choose. I know the Drew Clan have carried along a HH or 2 and stamped them into 
several boxes before they decide where they  want to leave it. I place all 
my letterboxes this way (bag within a bag) because after a couple of stampings, 
if the stamp is not in a separate bag the logbook  can get pretty messy. I 
also carry baby wipes and clean all stamps before I stamp them into my 
logbook.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div> I also only want to know 
where my HHers have been. Not where they reside today or will be placed (a 
recent post told everything about some HHers). </div>

Point Defiance #2 a new box placed on July 12, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Point Defiance Park  #1  and   #2<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your journey starts at Point Defiance Park located in Tacoma, Washington.<br/>
The only time you will need to leave the trail is to recover the Letterbox.<br/>
Please respect the park and leave with more trash than you arrived with.<br/>
<br/>
You will want to enter the park on Pearl Street. Follow the signs to 5-mile<br/>
drive and look for the Gig Harbor Viewpoint. This is your starting point.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your walk.fairly easy good paths, takes an hour or less to find the<br/>
first box maybe an hour to two to find the second one..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Point Defiance Park  #1<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
-Let the crosswalk be your guide - from its center choose your direction and<br/>
start walking.<br/>
<br/>
-Go to the second circle and square and continue your walk there.<br/>
<br/>
-At the circle 210 degrees is best.<br/>
<br/>
-Stay square and off the road.<br/>
<br/>
-A square and a triangle show the way.<br/>
<br/>
-Don't be square!<br/>
<br/>
-100 degrees<br/>
<br/>
-Two triangles?  Head east.<br/>
<br/>
-Left 10 or 20 paces left.<br/>
<br/>
-If you are headed near North when the trail ends, circle triangle is your<br/>
next 80 degrees<br/>
<br/>
-When ahead is a circle a square a triangle 220 is your course<br/>
<br/>
-Two pair of red squares, ignore the first<br/>
<br/>
-From the center of the triangle, easy since he died, at 270 go 20 or 40<br/>
with the animals<br/>
<br/>
-240 is your target, a fallen tree and a stump<br/>
<br/>
-Over and down is where you will find me, please put me back to rest when<br/>
you are through.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Point Defiance Park  #2<br/>
<br/>
-From the center of the triangle (again) head 180 past a red square<br/>
<br/>
-Go 270<br/>
<br/>
-Between two triangles go 220 degrees<br/>
<br/>
-Hit the stump or the end - head 310 degrees<br/>
<br/>
-Through the spaces and lines - find a square to follow<br/>
<br/>
-Between two squares go 350 degrees<br/>
<br/>
-Stay to the North<br/>
<br/>
-At the highway like structure your path is at 60 degrees heading 20 degrees<br/>
<br/>
-Next intersection head north<br/>
<br/>
-Stay @ 0 degrees - no circles<br/>
<br/>
-Why oh why - right!<br/>
<br/>
-60 degrees is your mark  roads are bad - go 60<br/>
<br/>
-Time to head North<br/>
<br/>
-Across the road to the View<br/>
<br/>
-Follow 300 degrees and be a square again<br/>
<br/>
-Follow that down hill right turn not back up to the view<br/>
<br/>
-Green square on your right - blacktop on your left - keep it dead ahead<br/>
<br/>
-It's a mountain of a tree - Head North<br/>
<br/>
-Stop for a view and then keep heading West<br/>
<br/>
-From the first Square look 230 degrees from the next look 70 degrees for my<br/>
hiding place.<br/>
<br/>

Standard Disclaimer : It is a dangerous world out there. Stomping through<br/>
the beautiful outdoors looking for letterboxes can be dangerous. You could<br/>
be killed, maimed, or even seriously injured looking for letterboxes and<br/>
crossing the street. Using your head and being prepared will increase your<br/>
odds of survival. Good luck and please take out more trash than you brought<br/>
in with you.<br/>

I was out with the kids yesterday kicking off our Letterboxing season and <br/>
we found TWO hitchhikers at one letterbox!  One was really well hidden <br/>
beneath the letterbox and I didn't find it til I was re-hiding it.  What's <br/>
the etiquette about that; should I have left the newer of the two behind <br/>
for someone else or was it ok for me to take them both and put them in two <br/>
different letterboxes on our next outing?<br/>
<br/>
They were Cactus Flower HH and Little Artists Everywhere HH found at the <br/>
Arboretum Letterbox in Overland Park, Kansas.  If you get out this way, the <br/>
Arboretum is a bit South of Kansas City/Overland Park and is a beautiful <br/>
botanical garden area with ponds and watergarden, a Monet Garden and a <br/>
Medicine Wheel and lots of trails.  We were warned that if we come after <br/>
April to watch out for Timber rattlers and copperheads and there are signs <br/>
around about them.<br/>

Wow.  I don't even think our resident hitchhiker magnet (Amanda from <br/>

you found them both fair and square.  I say take them, but hide them <br/>

That feature on LBNA is broken.<br/>
<br/>
There is a partial work around. When you first look at the details of the hitchhiker (before you hit the flag) look at the URL address of the page. It will contain the box number (hhnum=). After you determine the box number, click the flag to log your find. The address will end with "hhnum=". After the = type in the box number and hit enter. This will fill in the box name and planter on the lower part of the screen. Once you have this, you will be able to log your find. Like I said this is a partial work around. When you save the find, the date will still be blank.<br/>

Is there also a way to get it on the list of letterboxes you have found?  Or<br/>
are hitchhikers not tracked that way?<br/>

  That feature on LBNA is broken.<br/>
<br/>
  There is a partial work around. When you first look at the details of the<br/>
hitchhiker (before you hit the flag) look at the URL address of the page. It<br/>
will contain the box number (hhnum=). After you determine the box number,<br/>
click the flag to log your find. The address will end with "hhnum=". After<br/>
the = type in the box number and hit enter. This will fill in the box name<br/>
and planter on the lower part of the screen. Once you have this, you will be<br/>
able to log your find. Like I said this is a partial work around. When you<br/>
save the find, the date will still be blank.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Hi, I am trying to record that I found a Hitchhiker. I am on<br/>
  letterboxing.org. I found the hitchhiker via the search engine,<br/>
  clicked on the green flag. <br/>
<br/>
  When the screen comes up this is what it says (note<br/>
<br/>
  Change Status<br/>
  Hitchhiker <br/>
  Owner <br/>
  Letterbox were HH found <br/>
  City <br/>
  State (or country if non-US)<br/>
  Status date date found (mm/dd/yyyy)<br/>
<br/>
  Then I put in all my info and when I hit submit I get a message that<br/>
  says Hitchhiker doesn't exist. Of course it does exist. <br/>
<br/>
  Is the feature not working correctly or am I doing it wrong?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>

I am somewhat of a newbie to this list, although I have been lurking <br/>
for a while- and I have a question... I recently found a hitchhiker (my <br/>
first) and I know what I am supposed to do with the actual hitchhiker <br/>
itself, but do I post a message here that it has been found? I was not <br/>
able to find it listed on either letterboxing.org or atlasquest so I <br/>
couldn't send a message directly to the original planter of the box. <br/>
There was a note to send an e-mail saying it had been found to <br/>
letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com, so I did that-<br/>
<br/>
Is there a place where hitchhikers are tracked that I just don't know <br/>
about?<br/>
<br/>
TIA!!<br/>

<br/>
  If it's not on the Wanda and Pete list then I guess the original owner didn't care to know it's whereabouts. But it's strange that they would direct you to the letterboxing-usa yahoo group if they didn't post it on the LBNA site. <br/>
