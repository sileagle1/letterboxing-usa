Exchange.<br/>
I plan on shipping all the stamps to Graham Howard around Dec. 30-31,<br/>
and he plan's to plant them on the moor in January '04.  As you can<br/>
imagine there has been a flurry of activity going on with a lot of<br/>
excited carving and emailing and planning.  <br/>
<br/>
A few boxers who have signed up might not be aware of the new shipping<br/>
date in spite of my (probably annoying and numerous) emails.  If for<br/>
some reason you have signed on but have not received this information<br/>
from me, please, please contact me now, before Sunday.  It is very<br/>
important that I have the information about your stamp before I leave<br/>
for the holidays and that you know where to mail the stamp.  It must<br/>
be in my hands no later than 12/29/03.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if anyone is unable to participate, please let me know now.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
:-)<br/>
