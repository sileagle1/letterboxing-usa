people know about your letterbox, is to first create an account on <br/>
eiather letterboxing.org, atlasquest.org, or both. They both then have <br/>
a method for posting clues. In AtlasQuest, pull-down the Letterboxes <br/>
menu and select "Add Planted Letterbox". On leterboxing.org (also <br/>
known as LBNA), click on the Add Letterbox link next to "For Members:".<br/>
<br/>
As to store-bought stamps, most people don't have a problem with them. <br/>
I'd say a good 30% or more of the letterboxes I've found have store-<br/>
bought stamps. I've used them myself in about 1/2 my planted <br/>
letterboxes. Hand-carved stamps are nice (my wife carves ours), but <br/>
they do take some skill and patience.<br/>

I have seen this statement over and over again in the newsgroups.  My <br/>

would wait patiently.  Then they drove around in a car &amp; did not move <br/>

the same.<br/>

I can only speak for myself.  I absolutely treasure the boxes that have<br/>
hand-carved stamps, even the most crude efforts of beginner carvers.  I'm<br/>
also fine with commercially-made-but-unique stamps.  If I find out that a<br/>
box has a store-bought stamp it doesn't necessarily mean that I won't go<br/>
search for the box, but it'll be after I've found every other box in the<br/>
area and there's nothing else to look for.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I prefer a hand-carved stamp.  I also think that's the default, at<br/>
least in this part of the country-Texas-(there are regional<br/>
differences in letterboxing, so I wouldn't know if that's necessarily<br/>
true everywhere).  If I had only enough time to find one box, I'd pick<br/>
the one with the hand-carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you use a bought stamp, I think mentioning that fact in the<br/>
clues is a good idea.  I also think that it's appreciated if you list<br/>
whether it's a fee area, mention any unexpected hazards (not your<br/>
usual run-of-the-mill-be-prepared hazards), give a general sense of<br/>
how long the hike is, and outline any other factors that will help the<br/>
finder make a good choice about whether that is an appropriate box to<br/>
look for.  Not all boxes are right for every finder.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea why your box wasn't getting visited.  How could one<br/>
know anything about the quality of the stamp carving before actually<br/>
finding it?  But maybe there was something about the other location<br/>
that drew more people.  <br/>

uniqueness of an individual stamp, no matter what it looks like.  <br/>
That's just us.  Mind you, we are a kid-centric team so it is <br/>
interesting to me that the kids value the effort over the image <br/>
quality.<br/>

HOWEVER, we also enjoy letterboxing for the places it takes us. If a <br/>
store-bought stamp is in a great place, then it doesn't matter at <br/>
all.<br/>

I don't know why people aren't seeking out your box, Morgun.  I <br/>
doubt it has to do with your stamp-carving abilities, however.  If <br/>
we were in your neighborhood, I can guarantee you that we would seek <br/>
your box out first if we knew a hand-carved stamp was inside, <br/>
provide that it was a kid-suitable location.<br/>

&gt; in a car &amp; did not move when the light turned green.  Almost<br/>
&gt; everyone blew their horn at them within 5 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if they surveyed people asking what other people would do in<br/>
such an instance, and I bet they'd tell you that most people would<br/>
honk their horns within 5 seconds. Kind of like asking people if they<br/>
think they're smarter than "average", then 70% of the people fess up.<br/>
Frankly, you'd be more likely to get an honest response when asking<br/>
about someone else than you are when asking about themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It's an interesting concept, though.<br/>

<br/>
I'd want a lot more information before concluding that people prefered<br/>
store-bought stamps to your cruddy hand-carved ones. I hate<br/>
store-bought stamps. Honestly, you won't find me going out of the way<br/>
for a stamp I suspect is an eyesore, but I don't go out of my way to<br/>
avoid them either. I will go out of my way to avoid a store-bought<br/>
stamp. If I want that image in my logbook, I'd go to a stamp store and<br/>
stamp away!<br/>
<br/>
I have been known to go out of my way for stamps by people known for<br/>
their amazing carving abilities. And, oh, how crushed I was when I<br/>
found my first Drew stamp and the thing was, well, less than stellar.<br/>
I can say that now because I've since from Drew stamps that really do<br/>
live up to the reputation, and now it's something to brag about that I<br/>
have a crappy Jay Drew stamp. Very rare, indeed! ;o)<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, an exquistly carved stamp will draw more people in than a<br/>
lousy carving, but there are so many other factors that go into the<br/>
choice of a box. Mystery boxes get much less activity than<br/>
non-mysteries. Drive-bys get far more activities than those that<br/>
require even short hikes. Those in the city get far more activity than<br/>
those just 15 miles outside of town. Those planted by well-known<br/>
people are more likely to get visits than boxes by a relative<br/>
unknown--we like to find boxes planted by friends before strangers,<br/>
all else being equal.<br/>
<br/>
Without knowing more about the boxes, it's impossible to give a good<br/>
reason for why one box gets so much more activity than a second box,<br/>
but I'd be truely shocked if that many people prefered a store-bought<br/>
stamp to the most terrible of hand-carved stamps. I could imagine that<br/>
people might prefer a creative and interesting custom-made stamp to a<br/>
lousy hand-carved one, but custom-made stamps are so few in this<br/>
country, it's hard to make any judgements on those. After seeing some<br/>
of the custom-made stamps on Dartmoor, I rather liked quite a few of<br/>
them and would have chosen some of them over certain hand-carved<br/>
stamps. But there's never been a store-bought stamp I'd choose over a<br/>
hand-carved one. Never. *nodding*<br/>

place have hand carved stamps. I also like the surprise of the image and if I've seen the <br/>

rare.<br/>

&gt; For the most part we love hand-carved stamps as well, regardless of <br/>
&gt; skill level.  Some are truly works of art, while others (ours <br/>
&gt; included) are good tries -- though for the latter, we really enjoy <br/>
&gt; watching skills develop.  But we *always* appreciate the effort and <br/>
&gt; uniqueness of an individual stamp, no matter what it looks like.  <br/>
&gt; That's just us.  Mind you, we are a kid-centric team so it is <br/>
&gt; interesting to me that the kids value the effort over the image <br/>
&gt; quality.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; HOWEVER, we also enjoy letterboxing for the places it takes us. If a <br/>
&gt; store-bought stamp is in a great place, then it doesn't matter at <br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don't know why people aren't seeking out your box, Morgun.  I <br/>
&gt; doubt it has to do with your stamp-carving abilities, however.  If <br/>
&gt; we were in your neighborhood, I can guarantee you that we would seek <br/>
&gt; your box out first if we knew a hand-carved stamp was inside, <br/>
&gt; provide that it was a kid-suitable location.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please, no flames.  Morgun asked, we answered.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, give me a 'crummy' hand-carved stamp over a store-bought one any  <br/>
day! Yes, I appreciate the hike and a nice place, but I will admit  <br/>
that it's a little bit of a let-down to find a store-bought stamp I  <br/>
could have bought myself at the local Michaels..... I would much  <br/>
rather see new placers jump in and carve something, anything - it  <br/>
adds a lot to the box and the feeling that *you* placed a box.<br/>
<br/>
I will say that I am not a very prolific placer. Yet. :-)  I will  <br/>
also readily admit that I have little to no artistic ability.  <br/>
However, I found that just picking up the carving tools and medium  <br/>
and giving it a go was FUN! It doesn't take much practice at all to  <br/>
be able to make a decent stamp - try a line-drawing in negative to  <br/>
start. It adds something to the placing experience when you're  <br/>
placing a stamp you made and it sure adds to the finding experience  <br/>
for a lot of us. I know I'd choose a LB hunt with a  hand-carved  <br/>
stamp any day of the week - if I know it's store-bought, it goes to  <br/>
the end of the priority list unless there is something super-special  <br/>
drawing me to that LB.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that not everyone cares. I don't care in the sense that my  <br/>
life is over if I find a store-bought stamp. However, there is enough  <br/>
of a difference in both ends of the experience that I'd encourage  <br/>
everyone who can physically carve to give it a go. Forget being self- <br/>
conscious over your first effort and just enjoy the attempt. We  <br/>
will. :-)<br/>

Location of your boxes may be more of a factor in determining the <br/>
number of finds. (BTW, what name do you plant under?)<br/>
<br/>
Some of my boxes have been through three logbooks already while <br/>
others, just as old, are on their first. Longer hikes, more secluded <br/>
park areas, who knows why people don't look for them.<br/>
<br/>
I missed out on some boxes that were on half-mile hikes this weekend <br/>
because I was travelling with extremely grumpy kids who didn't want <br/>
to do anything. the only boxes I got were virtual drive-bys.<br/>
