<br/>

All the beaches in the Virgin Islands are open to the public.  This <br/>
letterbox is at the Carambola Resort, along the North Shore Road on <br/>
the northern end of the Island.<br/>
<br/>
The beaches at the Carambola Resort (and indeed much of the beach <br/>
area of St. Croix) are sea turtle nesting habitats.  Three species of <br/>
endangered sea turtle nest on the beaches of Carambola: the <br/>
leatherback, the hawksbill and the green turtle.<br/>
<br/>
For your Sea Turtle stamp imprint go to the Carambola Resort.  (Not <br/>
the golf course!)  Just before you reach the guardhouse, there is <br/>
public beach access parking on your left.  Park here (if you are not <br/>
staying at the Carambola Resort).  Follow the signs for the Public <br/>
Beach Access.  This will take you down some stairs and you will come <br/>
to 3 poles in front of Flammable Gas.  From the 3rd pole take 30 <br/>
steps.  On your right will be a large piece of Brain Coral underneath <br/>
a palm tree.  The Letterbox is underneath this piece of Coral.<br/>
<br/>
PS--to those of you who know what my stamps look like--<br/>
This is a much improved piece of carving!  And it is well worth a <br/>
trip to the Virgin Islands to pick up this stamp imprint :-)<br/>
