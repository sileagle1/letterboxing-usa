<br/>
Uhum..uhum.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Heartland<br/>
..and er....and er I am a..er<br/>
 A Letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>
{pause for a chorus of Welcome Heartland}<br/>
<br/>
It started just by chance you see!<br/>
<br/>
{I catch a few soft baleful murmured whispers of we<br/>
know, we know}<br/>
<br/>
I was working out of Boston and had to take a work<br/>
trip of two weeks up in Vermont and so I drove up and<br/>
stayed in a really nice little motel in such a lovely<br/>
town....<br/>
<br/>
{uhumph}<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes... well the weekend I was sorta at a lose end<br/>
and went for a stroll in a local park and saw two guys<br/>
and a woman and two kids taking something out from<br/>
behind a tree.<br/>
<br/>
They looked kinda OK and they were obviously very<br/>
excited by their find, so I asked em what were they<br/>
doing.<br/>
<br/>
They were kinda cagey and instead gave me a little<br/>
card with this LBNA web site URL.<br/>
<br/>
{I am sure someone muttered Oh no Oh no Oh no}<br/>
<br/>
I punched it into my lap top back at the motel and<br/>
found out about Letterboxing. It sounded sorta neat.<br/>
<br/>
So when I was driving back to Boston I took a short<br/>
detour and followed these clues and I FOUND ME A<br/>
LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
My FIRST Box. <br/>
<br/>
You know how that feels???.<br/>
<br/>
{Yeah we know. Go on}<br/>
<br/>
I stamped up on the back of my motel bill and wrote a<br/>
howdy in the book and put the box back and hid it<br/>
and well it was way cool<br/>
<br/>
I was a Letterboxer<br/>
<br/>
Well actually I was a NEWBIE and ...er hooked.<br/>
<br/>
So that night I fired off about 18 emails to the LBNA<br/>
main site asking for help.<br/>
<br/>
{Groan}<br/>
<br/>
I got this nice off-list email from a guy called Ryan<br/>
who asked me to post to the newbie site (whatever that<br/>
meant.)<br/>
<br/>
So Monday in Boston in my lunchbreak I got me a blank<br/>
notebook and a store bought stamp as my trail stamp.<br/>
<br/>
{more groans}<br/>
<br/>
So that next weekend I went out hunting me Boston<br/>
Boxes !<br/>
<br/>
I found three !<br/>
<br/>
I actually found five, but two had odd things in. One<br/>
had some gum wrappers and a plastic frog and the other<br/>
some very old damp cookies and a Clinton campaign pin!<br/>
<br/>
{some laughter}<br/>
<br/>
I stamped a page from my book and put them in each.<br/>
<br/>
{more laughter}<br/>
<br/>
When I got home I went back in to the LBNA site to<br/>
tell folk about my great day and to write a long<br/>
SITREP only to find that I had committed two very<br/>
serious crimes ..I had used a store bought stamp and<br/>
had been Geocaching!<br/>
<br/>
{There was a loud hissing noise and the controller<br/>
smiled at me and said We dont use THAT word in here<br/>
my dear!....but do go on; do go on }<br/>
<br/>
The next Monday I was back at the art store asking for<br/>
Xacto and pink stuff..which they did sell me over the<br/>
counter in clear sight of regular customers, but yes<br/>
it was in a plain brown bag.<br/>
<br/>
{Shame}<br/>
<br/>
Well it just went on from there ... Ive been to group<br/>
meets and discuss the various types of adhesives and<br/>
blade types and ink and ....hitchikers <br/>
<br/>
{an sharp intake of breath}<br/>
<br/>
and Postal Boxes<br/>
<br/>
{lets keep it clean! someone yelled}<br/>
<br/>
and X counts and V counts and H and H+ counts and then<br/>
I started in with some..er some ..<br/>
<br/>
WOM letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
{Loud gasps}  <br/>
<br/>
Im out every weekend, and in the evenings Im locked<br/>
in my room carving, I have Hitchiker records; I use<br/>
AtlasQuest and other even more unsavoury sites, even<br/>
one where a Sewer Rat runs it ! <br/>
<br/>
{Go for it someone called out}<br/>
<br/>
I do cryptics and even carry letterboxes overseas in<br/>
my hand luggage..I even do cheeseracing..and have<br/>
actually seen The Maplines from a distance...from a<br/>
distance!<br/>
<br/>
{universal Gasps!}<br/>
<br/>
Is there any way out ?<br/>
<br/>
Is there any hope?<br/>
<br/>
An addict.<br/>
