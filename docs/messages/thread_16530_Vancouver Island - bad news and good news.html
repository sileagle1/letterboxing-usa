                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went to Victoria on Saturday, and I took along the clues for The <br/>
Bear and the Berry and for the $20 letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
Along with my husband and a friend, I first looked for the Bear and <br/>
the Berry.  I'm pretty sure I looked under the right little pile of <br/>
rocks along the Galloping Goose Trail (I had a compass along, and <br/>
all three of us thought we were in the right place) but there was <br/>
nothing there. I did, however, enjoy looking at the mural nearby. <br/>
Perhaps the box's owner wouldn't mind checking to see whether the <br/>
box has been removed?  <br/>
<br/>
Then we looked for the $20 box.  Its placement date is 1969, so I'm <br/>
not surprised we couldn't find it.  We figured it must be in Beacon <br/>
Hill Park, and started at the monument there, but we couldn't even <br/>
locate the second clue.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anybody else found these two boxes in the last few months/years?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I went out to Bowen Park today to check my <br/>
Autumn's Treasure box, and found that Evan had been to visit <br/>
already.  Hiya, Evan!  Please note that I did visit your Love <br/>
Letters  box shortly after you placed it, but I had no stamp yet, <br/>
and my pen got lost on the way over the rocks.  As soon as the <br/>
monsoons pass and the rocks aren't so slippery, I'll go back with a <br/>
stamp and record my visit.  I haven't checked the Imagine box since <br/>
I planted it.  I wonder if you've been there too.<br/>
<br/>
So get busy, eh, Evan?  ;&gt;) It looks like it's just you and me in <br/>
the Nanaimo area, so far.  I'm working on my Winter Solstice <br/>
presentation.<br/>

Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Wild Child and I may have been the last finders of the 20 Bucks LB (my first <br/>
box found outside the US); we nabbed it on Aug 31 of this year.  It wasn't <br/>
placed in 1969, tho.  I think maybe that's the default date that used to pop up <br/>
in the old system.  I'll e-mail you off-list about where you might have gone <br/>
wrong--so don't delete the coming message from pnwexplr, thinking it's junk mail.<br/>
