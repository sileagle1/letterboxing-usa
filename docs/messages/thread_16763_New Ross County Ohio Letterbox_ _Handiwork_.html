Chillicothe, Ohio. Difficulty: Easy. This letterbox is located in <br/>
St. Margaret's Cemetery, Chillicothe Ohio. Driving directions: From <br/>
Rt. 50 (Western Ave.) turn north onto Delano Ave.( Next to Central <br/>
Center shopping center). Follow Delano north until it dead ends at <br/>
Allen Ave. Turn left onto Allen Ave., and go 2 blocks to Worthington <br/>
Ave. Turn right onto Worthington; the cemetery entrance will be <br/>
about one block away, on your left.          CLUES: Upon entering <br/>
the cemetery, bear towards the right. Continue until you come to <br/>
a "hairpin" turn. Stop before entering the turn and look for a stump <br/>
near the fence. From this stump, you will need to take 12 paces at <br/>
18 degrees to a large pine tree. Then go 13 paces at 335 degrees <br/>
from the pine to another tree. The box is at the base of this tree <br/>
under some bark and a rock.<br/>
