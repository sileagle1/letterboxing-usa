    I found some wonderful sketch books at Borders Books. They come in<br/>
two sizes: 6" x 9" for $3.99 and 8 1/2"  x 11" for $5.99. The paper is<br/>
bright white and acid free. They are 192 pages and bound with nice,<br/>
plain colored hard covers. I thought these were an exceptionally good<br/>
value and I bought a bunch......<br/>

Yeah, last time I went to the Borders near me they had a whole bunch<br/>
of 4"x6" hardbound sketch books with about 220 pages of acid-free<br/>
paper, just like the one I've been using for letterboxing, literally<br/>
piled on the floor (I think they were reshelving).  $3.49 each.  One<br/>
of the books, my stamp pad, and my rather large 3"x4" stamp fit<br/>
comfortably in my jacket pocket (which is good, because 3 of my stamps<br/>
are looseleaf since I forgot my book that day).<br/>
