<br/>
I use Amaco Sculptamold Modeling Compound at about two parts to  one of <br/>
water. Three pounds of it is about $5 + tax. It sets up in about 30 minutes and is <br/>
very nicely hard after a day. I am now mixing in tan, black, and silver paint <br/>
with the wet material before I mold it (then add more Sculptamold if the <br/>
mixture is too wet.) That way if the "rock" gets beaten up, it will still be <br/>
naturally colored throughout. I like it to band a little and am hoping to get better <br/>
at making it do so. I put in some glittery silver paint to get the effect of <br/>
flecks of mica in it. I mold this around tupper-like containers or film <br/>
cannisters with the lid side down. I make sure the lid still will seat around the <br/>
sealing surface. If it does not, the set material is pretty easily pared away <br/>
with a knife.<br/>
<br/>
I spray each rock with matte finish plastic sealer, top and bottom. I try to <br/>
get at least two coats on. They are fairly lightweight. You could put large <br/>
iron washers in for extra weight if you thought that a problem. I try to place <br/>
these in fairly sheltered locations. My other fake rocks are real rocks that I <br/>
have hollowed out by drill. I am sure you can find some other materials to <br/>
play with. I have done  oven hardening clay with some success but it is a tad <br/>
pricey.<br/>
<br/>
 Check the clue for my Stone Soup box.<br/>
<br/>
Oven-hardening clay is ok but I have sprayed it with a spackled rock paint <br/>
(craft stores have lots of these kinds) and again, folks look right past them.  <br/>
You can also hollow out rocks if you buy travertine and use a concrete bit. <br/>
Make sure you use respiratory and eye protection while doing this. Gloves are <br/>
also a good thought.<br/>
