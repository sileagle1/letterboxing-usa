Life isn't fair.  Call it a personal traveller -- and leave some <br/>
instructions in the log book describing how the finder *might* be <br/>
able to score the personal traveller without leaving the store -- if <br/>
they're lucky.  Don't mention it at all in the online clues.<br/>

 All I can say is you must get that from the Momma.<br/>

 Even though I lurk mostly I've watched this thread and you have to come to realize that it is a product of thia society. Most people believe that they have rights without responsibility.  Just yesterday I went to Lowes and someone had unpacked their purchase and left ALL the packing on the ground in the parking lot. So it is everywhere.<br/>

When the OP wrote that there was litter all around letterboxers, we <br/>
all reacted with disbelief that any of us could do such a thing.  It <br/>
is difficult to imagine that any letterboxer would just scatter trash <br/>
around while stamping in -- but if you think about it, it's difficult <br/>
to imagine that ANYONE would just scatter trash around while doing <br/>
ANYTHING.  I'm not sure we are justified that letterboxers are any <br/>
less prone to littering than the average person in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
I still say that litterbugs should be stood against a wall and shot.  <br/>
It's not about the seriousness of littering; it's about what <br/>
littering says about one's character.  If you're the type of person <br/>
that would litter, you're the type of person that our society would <br/>
be better off without.<br/>

LOL, my GF and I were in Priest Park, Olympia WA last week looking <br/>
for "Alice" and trying to wait out a group of kids building <br/>
emergency shelters. When they had left, I found they had dug up <br/>
another LB ("Eagle") while grabbing building materials and rather <br/>
then re-hide it, it was just sitting out in plain view. So we <br/>
covered it back up but didn't open it as we hadn't done anything to <br/>
find it. I have to assume it was close to the orginal location. I <br/>
was leaving to go back to N. Virginia the next day so we couldn't <br/>
try to figure it out. <br/>

Anyhoo, Kirbert gave Tony an excellent reply to his first question. <br/>
I can add nothing and, not being familiar with boxing in MA, I will <br/>
have to leave any answer to the second question to others.<br/>

This implies a competitive vibe (otherwise, why would it matter<br/>
that it is of a different level of difficulty for others?).  Not<br/>
that I'm passing judgement on competitive vibes, or the lack<br/>
thereof, in this pastime.  Its just that I've been away so long,<br/>
and so out of touch.  Is there a competitive vibe?  (What it actually<br/>
implies is that clues need to be "fair" across a spectrum of readers;<br/>
this, of course, isn't necessary unless there is competition, but<br/>
I acknowledge the anthropological fact that people have a sense of<br/>
"fairness" even in the absence of explicit or implicit competition,<br/>
for reasons that are beyond the scope of my post).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; What??!!??  Of course you had done something to find it.  You had <br/>

Now, here's another question.  If you go to place a box, you know,<br/>
in that beautiful distinct old growth tree with that perfect nook<br/>
that may or may not look like an Orycteropus afer, and lo and behold,<br/>
another box is there.  We've all seen this (at least those of us<br/>
who have been doing this forever).  So, do you count this?  Do you<br/>
go log this on some web site somewhere?  Just curious.  Ties into<br/>
the competition question.<br/>
<br/>
These questions and many others will not be answered on the next<br/>
episode of Soap (but isn't modern life fantastic -- you can get all<br/>
the episodes of Soap at Netflix), but they seem interesting nonetheless.<br/>
(Not to hijack the thread any further -- a true Beldin's thread being<br/>
one (as recently pointed out by another poster) that looks nothing like<br/>
the original question -- I think that is a good thing -- it shows a<br/>
vibrant and fun community -- we'll be there when people are putting<br/>
"I don't mean to start a flame war" at the beginning of their posts).<br/>

&gt; This implies a competitive vibe<br/>
<br/>
OK, I can see that.  It wasn't really my intention to imply such, <br/>
though.  To my way of thinking, the collection of sig stamp images in <br/>
a letterbox log book represents a club of sorts, the select few <br/>
individuals who have experienced this letterbox and all that it <br/>
entails: the location, the stamp, the challenge of the hunt.  But if <br/>
some people manage to figure out a particularly challenging set of <br/>
clues (albeit challenging only because the placer screwed them all up <br/>
when listing the box) and then the rest found it with no challenge at <br/>
all because the clues had been made clearer, they don't really belong <br/>
to the same club, do they?<br/>
<br/>
Did that make any sense?  I suppose I could give examples.  Let's say <br/>
you found a mystery box in which the puzzle involved some really <br/>
serious research to solve.  In three years, only you and a couple of <br/>
other people found it.  Then the owner, seeing as how very few people <br/>
had found his box, changes the clue listing to simply tell people <br/>
where to go to find it.  Then a dozen find it in the next year.  How <br/>
would you feel about it?  Would you feel a kinship with those later <br/>
finders?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &gt; What??!!??  Of course you had done something to find it.  You had<br/>
&gt; &gt; FOUND it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, here's another question.  If you go to place a box, you know, in<br/>
&gt; that beautiful distinct old growth tree with that perfect nook that<br/>
&gt; may or may not look like an Orycteropus afer, and lo and behold,<br/>
&gt; another box is there.  We've all seen this (at least those of us who<br/>
&gt; have been doing this forever).  So, do you count this?  Do you go log<br/>
&gt; this on some web site somewhere?  Just curious.  Ties into the<br/>
&gt; competition question.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I log it!  I *found* it!  I do clarify in the log book, <br/>
though, that it was an accidental find.<br/>
<br/>
Think about the alternative.  Let's say you don't log it, then later <br/>
doing a search you run across the clues for that box.  Do you run <br/>
back out there and stamp in?  You already know where the box is, it's <br/>
not as though it's a challenge to find.  Or do you consider this box <br/>
"ruined", it's forever off your list of possible hunts?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; These questions and many others will not be answered on the next<br/>
&gt; episode of Soap (but isn't modern life fantastic -- you can get all<br/>

 &gt; they don't really belong to the same club, do they?<br/>
<br/>
Not really.  But the existence of the club is competition, I'd<br/>
offer anyway.  Not really my point to argue so about it, just<br/>
an observation.  We all know letterboxing is cliquish (in<br/>
varying degrees depending on varying factors).<br/>
<br/>
As to being fair, its never gonna be fair.  We talk about<br/>
the terrain changes, season changes and the like; we talk<br/>
less about how those who have found the box spill the beans<br/>
to those who have not, etc., all of this being unfair.  So,<br/>
suggesting to the writer how to clean up their clue doesn't<br/>
really make things that much more unfair, IMHO, so back to the<br/>
original point.  I'm not big on communication between the writer<br/>
and the seeker except via the published clue (the information leaks<br/>
thru other channels really ruin the whole thing for me, to be<br/>
honest), but if you are going to, I wouldn't let fears of unfairness<br/>
be the barrier.  Of course, I can see the fear of exclusivity --<br/>
slightly different, and may be more to the point that fears of<br/>
unfairness, in which case I see your point.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Think about the alternative.  Let's say you don't log it, then later <br/>
&gt; doing a search you run across the clues for that box.  Do you run <br/>

<br/>
I wouldn't, that would seem silly.  I don't log things, and have a<br/>
horrible memory, tho, so with my luck I'd find it again and not even<br/>
realise it under the above scenerio :)  I can't even remember where<br/>
I put my own boxes, for crissakes, and certainly can't remember how<br/>
to solve the clues :-)<br/>

Without this list and the logging function on the clue sites we would have no idea what <br/>
others were doing. I boxed for quite awhile before I found this list and before the logging <br/>
function. I don't  log my finds most of the time. Sometimes I don't even stamp into my log <br/>
if I find a commercial stamp. I'm also known for not being able to find my own boxes.<br/>
Boxing is many things to many people. It started out for me as something fun to do with <br/>
my family. Now? It changes from day to day, sometimes it's a social thing with people I <br/>
have grown to know and love, sometimes it's a spiritual connection with another artist, <br/>
sometimes it's a mental and physical challenge. <br/>
Over the years I've seen people come and go, they light up the list for awhile with new and <br/>
bright ideas and then they move on to the next big thing, and others stay for the long haul <br/>
and the growing pains.<br/>

Probably not if I followed them.  But there are a few I can't<br/>
visualize the space sitting here at home.  There are a couple<br/>
that I just have no idea exactly where they are without the clues.<br/>
I know where they are to about 20 feet, but its that last part<br/>
I find the least interesting, and thus have the least memory of,<br/>
and would have to go out with the clues like everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately I keep pretty good notes, but some of these things<br/>
are pushing 10 years old soon; I imagine at 20 or 30 years, some<br/>
of the details will fade even more.  And some are just bad, so<br/>
it is probably just as well that they fade from my mind.<br/>

 Fortunately I keep pretty good notes, but some of these things<br/>
 are pushing 10 years old soon; I imagine at 20 or 30 years, some<br/>
 of the details will fade even more.  And some are just bad, so<br/>
 it is probably just as well that they fade from my mind.<br/>

<br/>
Its all originals, in varying states of repair.  Once they go, they go,<br/>
I tend not to replace them, tho sometimes others do.<br/>
<br/>
The oldest one went missing -- I did replace that one, then it went<br/>
missing again I think, so I said, oh well.  It wasn't in a very secure<br/>
spot, but its location was dictated by other constraints.  That's the<br/>
way it goes.<br/>

 When the OP wrote that there was litter all around letterboxers, we <br/>
 all reacted with disbelief that any of us could do such a thing.  It <br/>
 is difficult to imagine that any letterboxer would just scatter trash <br/>
 around while stamping in -- but if you think about it, it's difficult <br/>
 to imagine that ANYONE would just scatter trash around while doing <br/>
 ANYTHING.  I'm not sure we are justified that letterboxers are any <br/>
 less prone to littering than the average person in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
 I still say that litterbugs should be stood against a wall and shot.  <br/>
 It's not about the seriousness of littering; it's about what <br/>
 littering says about one's character.  If you're the type of person <br/>
 that would litter, you're the type of person that our society would <br/>
 be better off without.<br/>

used to watch it every night in syndication in college before I went <br/>
to bed.<br/>
<br/>
With the brother grabbing anything to make *something* talk and then <br/>
using the grapefruit was pure comic genius, in a show that was genius <br/>
to start with.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have Netflix but I have the same thing thru Blockbuster.  Now <br/>
I have to go put Soap on my queue.<br/>
<br/>
KuKu<br/>
<br/>
you can get all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the episodes of Soap at Netflix)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ye gads, that's the best reason I've heard yet for signing up for <br/>
&gt; Netflix.  I loved that show.  When Billy Crystal hid that hand <br/>
puppet <br/>
&gt; in the freezer and his brother made do with a grapefruit, I thought <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; was gonna bust a gut.<br/>
