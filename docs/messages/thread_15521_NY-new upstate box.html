Planted by: Mookie Fish<br/>
Name of box: FINAL EXAM <br/>
Date planted: Sept. 2, 2003<br/>
Town: Saratoga Springs<br/>
County: Saratoga<br/>
State: New York<br/>
Level of difficulty: Easy, mostly sidewalks<br/>
Time: Less than an hour<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Take I-89 to exit 14. Head east on NY-9P/Union Avenue until you <br/>
can go no further. Take a right on Circular, a left onto Lake and a right onto <br/>
Broadway (US-9/ NY-50).  Stay straight to go onto North Broadway. Park on <br/>
North Broadway.<br/>
<br/>
Heading uphill, starting walking north.<br/>
Choose one side of the street or wander back and forth.<br/>
Number 581 is the oldest on the street,<br/>
With pilasters, windows and columns that are Greek.<br/>
Number 695 is still as it was when built to please<br/>
way back in the early eighteen-seventies,<br/>
Keep walking north past number 719 <br/>
the one with the roof style of Anne the Queen.<br/>
It is referred to as Italianate Villa because of the tower.<br/>
If you need a rest, stop and look at the flowers.<br/>
Admire the opulent homes of the rich<br/>
And the lawn jockeys from whence horses would hitch.<br/>
See the one with diamonds of yellow and green?<br/>
This place houses the president of the college almost seen.<br/>
Walk further to enter the institution of learning.<br/>
Follow the drive up its twists and turnings.<br/>
Once at the map, stop and find number 10<br/>
Proceed to that place, you are nearing the end.<br/>
After a rest by this spot<br/>
in an easterly direction you will plot.<br/>
Cross over the bridge to the big red bug.<br/>
It's not really alive, so give it a hug.<br/>
Back over the bridge and look to your left<br/>
Now this is where you must be quite deft.<br/>
Down this path slink like a cat<br/>
To the tree on the right that is lying flat.<br/>
This tree points to two that cross.<br/>
At the base of these two, look in the moss.<br/>
<br/>
To return to your car is not that far.<br/>
Continue down the path to the field.<br/>
At the playground at the corner, you must yield.<br/>
The slides point the way you should walk.<br/>
Down this street, just for one block.<br/>
Turn left on Greenfield, an avenue not far<br/>
Just two blocks down and back to your car.<br/>
<br/>
