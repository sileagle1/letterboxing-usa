                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,  I have been lurking and enjoying some posts and staying out of the <br/>
100 degree + heat with the babes and trying to come up with places to hide <br/>
letterboxes for Wes and Jess and the Shorewood Folks to find here in <br/>
MO/KS.  Today is my daughter's first day of early childhood school so Baby <br/>
Bear and I went out  for a little hike to do some scouting.  We have found <br/>
3 boxes so far and have an idea what to look for as far as good places to <br/>
hide them but would appreciate any advice you veterans would care to pass <br/>
along.  Bear in mind, I usually have the Bear Cub in the backpack and a 3 <br/>
1/2 year old in tow.<br/>

Remember that things will look different when there is snow on the <br/>
ground and the leaves are off the trees. <br/>
<br/>
Also remember not to go too far off the trail. If it is a busy <br/>
letterbox, a new "trail" can be made to your hiding place. This is <br/>
not a good thing. <br/>
