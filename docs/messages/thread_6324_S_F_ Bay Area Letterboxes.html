boxes at S.F.Bay Wildlife Refuge(7/14). We found 2 out of 3 and we <br/>
were unable to find box #1(Mom read that it maybe missing.)<br/>
<br/>
We also went to Byxbee Park in Palo Alto. Only found 1 out 4(found <br/>
box #2).<br/>
<br/>
Well, let me introduce myself. I am Lizardbutt(age 5). My mom and <br/>
sister dragged me out to this park today (I hate to walk). My mom and <br/>
sister kept talking about dragons and trolls. I didn't like this park <br/>
one bit. My sister kept mumbling that this is a weird park  (I just <br/>
wanted to go home).My mom didn't care because she just loves the <br/>
outdoors and hiking. <br/>
<br/>
We were happy to find the one stamp. My mom thinks that the others <br/>
are missing. Someone please agree with her. Or I know that she will <br/>
drag me back. <br/>
<br/>
Oh by the way, I am called Lizardbutt because one day while I was <br/>
going to the bathroom a lizard jumped out of my pants. My aunt was <br/>
visiting us at the time and she started calling me this horrid name. <br/>
My mom just loves it!<br/>
<br/>
My mom is now talking about letterboxing and geocaching. Help!<br/>

<br/>
Sorry to hear you had a rough time.  Mom's can be tough like that <br/>
somtimes.  They dont understand about Video Games and Chips like <br/>
kids do.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Washington (that's a couple states north of you) so I dont <br/>
know about those letterboxes.  Oh and I'm really, really old... 33 <br/>
years old... that's like forever.<br/>
<br/>
I have to tell you tho, I dont think your mom is going to stop this <br/>
hiking stuff.  Letterboxing is only gonna make her want to do more <br/>
too!  So it looks like you're doomed to more fresh air and <br/>
exercise.  Sorry Bud.  =D<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck!<br/>
