                    <div class="plaintext-content">My employer sent me to Kansas City for training this week, so I took <br/>
the opportunity to hunt some boxes and to meet the famous Wes <br/>
Garrison.  He and his girlfriend, Jess, were kind enought to shuttle <br/>
me around to several of the following boxes.  These were found in <br/>
place and intact:<br/>
<br/>
Woodstock<br/>
Snoopy<br/>
Adam the Pilot<br/>
Split Tree -- Long View Bike Path #1<br/>
Three Roses -- Long View Bike Path #2<br/>
Mill Creek Streamway #2<br/>
<br/>
These were not found:<br/>
<br/>
Cattails -- Long View Bike Path #3<br/>
Mill Creek Streamway #1 (turns out it was pulled for repairs and <br/>
should be back in place shortly)<br/>
Blue Spruce -- Blue River Parkway #1<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Wes and Jess -- it was a pleasure to meet you, and I hope you <br/>
can make it out to the northeast real soon.  Just let Rutsypuff and <br/>
me know you're coming and I'll bet we can offer a place to stay.  <br/>
Thanks also for the CD store advice.  While I didn't get anything <br/>
from Half-Price Books, I did pick up 4 at CD Warehouse and 2 at <br/>
Vintage Stock.  If I'd had more time, I would have liked to spend a <br/>
few hours in Half-Price Books.<br/>
<br/>
Ciao!<br/>
