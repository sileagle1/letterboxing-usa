Providence Journal Sunday morning and took them to find the <br/>
Burlingame Reservoir and Laurel &amp; Hardy Boxes in Glocester.  All <br/>
boxes were found in place, intact, and dry.<br/>
<br/>
While out there, who should come along but Wanda and Pete.  (True, I <br/>
had invited them to come along to talk to the reporter, but they had <br/>
told me they probably couldn't make it, so it was a pleasant surprise <br/>
when they showed up).<br/>
<br/>
The weather was perfect and we all had a fine time hunting for the <br/>
boxes and chatting about the hobby.  We hope that we were able to <br/>
impress upon the reporter the messages of community, responsibility, <br/>
and Leave No Trace that we think are so important to the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
I will post to the list when the article appears in the paper.<br/>
<br/>
After the reporter and photographer took their leave, and Wanda and <br/>
Pete returned to Providence for Indian food, Rustypuff and I went to <br/>
find Pie Filling in the George Washington Memorial Forest.  It was <br/>
found in place, intact, and dry.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, we attempted TeamGreenDragon's Dexter in the Peter Randal <br/>
Reservation in North Providence, without success.  We investigated <br/>
several cellar holes and a tree house (or deer stand?), but nothing <br/>
revealed itself as "the house that N.C. built."  Still, it was a <br/>
revelation to discover that little park in the middle of suburbia.  <br/>
Anybody had any luck finding this box? <br/>
