                    <html><body>I thought this might be of interest to letterboxers,<br/>
Last spring, the National Park Service posted a sign in an Oregon national<br/>
forest.  I can't recite it verbatim, but it said that, as a safety measure,<br/>
it was recommended that hikers wear little bells and moth balls, so that<br/>
the grizzly bears, which can be dangerous when surprised, would be able to<br/>
detect the hikers' presence from a safe distance.  It was also recommended<br/>
that the hikers learn to distinguish between black bear stools and grizzly<br/>
bear stools, so the hikers would be able to determine which kind of bear<br/>
was in the vicinity.  Black bear stools can be identitied by the presence<br/>
of blueberry skins and blackberry seeds.    Grizzly bear stools have little<br/>
bells in them and smell like moth balls.<br/>
