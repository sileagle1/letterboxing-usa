hosting us at the white man's long house. We shared a great feast and traded many <br/>
goods. We were pleased to be reunited with many of our friends from familiar <br/>
tribes and even had a few new travelers from near and afar.<br/>
<br/>
Upon our travels with Mary Manatee and the Yachtsman we met up with Chuck and <br/>
Chickabirdie at the trading post of many dyes, and while there we met a <br/>
stranger to our clan who showed great interest in what we were doing. We welcomed <br/>
her into our tribe and gave her a log book of her own and we traded marks. I am <br/>
sure we will see her (calling herself "Happy Stamper" for now) at future <br/>
gatherings.<br/>
<br/>
It was a wonderful conclave and we look forward to meeting Mary Manatee and <br/>
the Yachtsman again soon at their longhouse in the land of the Wampanoags and <br/>
Pokanoket.<br/>
