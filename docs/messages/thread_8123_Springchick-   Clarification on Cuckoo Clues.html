&gt; A couple of further questions on the cuckoo clue thing...  I <br/>
&gt; understand that the clues are not published anywhere, but is the <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; listed anywhere (noting that it is a cuckoo)? <br/>
<br/>
 Not that I'm aware of.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Are there a lot of <br/>
&gt; them about? <br/>
<br/>
 Could be.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; When you find one, do you e-mail the owner or anything?<br/>
<br/>
 I didn't, because I posted on list. I knew Squirrel would see it. <br/>
You can e-mail the owner if you want. Just like finding a box or HH. <br/>
I hope that just about covers all questions. It's pretty logical once <br/>
you get one.<br/>
