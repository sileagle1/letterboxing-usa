  no i hadn't intended for this to happen. i had hoped to not get the 2 confused. so i might as well let the cat out of the bag. yes the first time we box again is the weekend i come to pennsylvania, but this invasion thing is a game i thought up. as time goes on, it becomes more intense and when the time comes, the invasion begins and it is everyones job to try and stop us. working on the little details on how you will try and do that. all i should say is, plan on august 12th, the day people should try and stop me. i'll expain more as time goes on.<br/>
