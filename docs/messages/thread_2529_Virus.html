One rule of thumb is to never click on e-mail attachments<br/>
unless you personally know the sender, _and_ expect them <br/>
to be sending you an attachment at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Another rule of thumb is to not use Microsoft's e-mail<br/>
programs, such as Outlook and Outlook Express.  Moreover,<br/>
be wary of attachments when the _sender_ is using one<br/>
of these two programs, even if you know the sender<br/>
personally (the header fields of the e-mail often identify<br/>
the program they are using).<br/>
<br/>
Neither is a substitute for anti-virus software, but both<br/>
can help.<br/>
<br/>
The list allows attachments because some people prefer<br/>
to send their clues out that way.  We can turn attachments<br/>
off if there is a groundswell of support for that notion,<br/>
but it seems out the the spirit of letterboxing to do so.<br/>
In letterboxing, there should be no presumption of clue <br/>
formatting, nor requirement that clues be plaintext as <br/>
opposed to attachments such as .doc files (though I'm sure<br/>
many would prefer this).  <br/>
<br/>
In these cases, the webmasters (I believe) sometimes convert <br/>
the clues to html, so the answer may be to simply wait until <br/>
that occurs if you wish to avoid clicking on the attachment.<br/>
I never click on attachments submitting to any mailing list,<br/>
even if they are presented as letterboxing clues.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, the list also provides a files upload/download <br/>
capability, which may be an alternative to sending large clue <br/>
attachments to everyone.<br/>

Thanks for the input about the virus thing! It's the last thing I need to <br/>
recieve. I'm grateful that the person how set this computer up for my son <br/>
did include anti-virus software. I agree that the safest bet is to leave all <br/>
attachments alone if you aren't expecting one from someone you know _very_ <br/>
well...<br/>
Hey! Tomarrow Lockmaster, Muk-Luk and I are heading up to Waterfall Walk!! <br/>
Will let you know your boxes condition, if we are lucky enough to locate <br/>
it!!<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>

If you are an actual letterboxer please post an explanation to the <br/>
list about what this attachment is. The message I received just <br/>
quoted my posting to the list and told me to look at the attachment. <br/>
Fortunately, I use primarily Macs (and no MS products) which makes my <br/>
virus vulnerability much less. However this is disturbing, and might <br/>
reflect someone who's machine was infected and did something <br/>
automatically  (though that seems unlikely given the specific <br/>
postings which were replied to), something intentionally malicious, <br/>
or perhaps not a virus. I wouldn't suggest anyone who  received it <br/>
open it to find out until it is clear.<br/>
