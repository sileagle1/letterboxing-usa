&gt; I tried to kinda match the background color of the usual LB-NA<br/>
&gt;  listing... but I don't know how successful I was. Is there a way I<br/>
&gt;  can match that?<br/>
<br/>
Deborah,<br/>
Naturally, any color scheme that appeals to you is perfect for your clue <br/>
pages, but if you really want to match the colors I've used for many of the <br/>
other webpages, they are STEELBLUE and WHEAT.  I don't remember what these <br/>
translate to in hexidecimal, but I think most browsers will accept these <br/>
english color descriptions.  I hope someone who knows what they're talking <br/>
about will speak up if I'm wrong in making this assumption.<br/>
<br/>
So, at the top of the HTML file for most of the clue pages, I define the body <br/>
color of the page in the line that reads   by inserting the phrase <br/>
BGCOLOR="STEELBLUE"<br/>
<br/>
I then put the text and pictures in a table, which is defined by a line that <br/>
begins <br/>
<table ...="">.  The color of the table is established by inserting <br/>
BGCOLOR="WHEAT" into this line.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps, Deborah.  By the way, ANYONE who wishes to publish their <br/>
own clues can simply copy the source file from one of their favorite clue <br/>
pages.  Use a text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the verbage of the clues, <br/>
retaining all the original formatting.  HTML coding is very intuitive and <br/>
easy to understand if you just compare it to the way the page looks in your <br/>
browser.<br/>
<br/>
Many Internet Service Providers (such as America Online or Mindspring) will <br/>
let you upload your own webpages to their server for little or no extra cost. <br/>
 Alternately, you can notify this discussion group and one of our willing <br/>
volunteers will gladly host the webpage for you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I changed the color and size of type a bit to increase the contrast.<br/>
Hope that will be better! I'll still be struggling with the web page<br/>
concept for a while ~ maybe forever ~ so I will definitely be asking<br/>
for help!<br/>

&gt;  I used to like Otis Redding a lot too, but I remember him as looking <br/>

Dear Deborah,<br/>
<br/>
Your page is much easier to read now with this color pair. I think it <br/>
looks great.<br/>
<br/>
