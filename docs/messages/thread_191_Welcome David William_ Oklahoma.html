<br/>
Here's his email addy if any of you want to contact<br/>
him:<br/>
mailto:dwilliam@snu.edu<br/>
<br/>
He is on the list as well.<br/>
<br/>
He is now the Oklahoma state contact, so you can<br/>
also email him by clicking Oklahoma on the left-<br/>
hand U.S. map at:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
So Oklahoma is on the map all of a sudden.  David<br/>
contacted me yesterday.  He is a teacher (prof) at<br/>
SNU (Southern Nazarene University) near Oklahoma City. <br/>
He's been quietly monitoring the list and has<br/>
placed 4 letterboxes on campus which will serve,<br/>
among other things, to assist students in developing<br/>
orienteering skills.<br/>
<br/>
Have a look at his clues.  They're quite cerebral<br/>
and interesting, a combination of GPS, compass bearings<br/>
and themes/riddles.<br/>
Here is the map link to them.  Once there click on the<br/>
purple dot for SNU:<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/ok.htm<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you've made instant friends here David,<br/>
esp. among the "50 by Y2K" crowd.<br/>
<br/>
(50 by Y2K = 13 states down, 37 to go by the year 2000.)<br/>
<br/>
If you've been monitoring the talk list I'm sure you can<br/>
tell that we are an informal, loosely organized group<br/>
with an open forum format (within letterboxing).<br/>
<br/>
Somebody here is good at almost anything letterboxing-<br/>
related - the special brand of it that is<br/>
developing here in the states.<br/>
Do ask questions if any you have.  Don't be afraid to<br/>
use the list to do this as it will get the most<br/>
responses for you -- oh, typically 5 or 6 anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome aboard.  Its good to have you be part<br/>
of what we're doing.<br/>
<br/>
I thank you on behalf of all of us here at Letterbox USA.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Dan<br/>

	A fine set of clues - nicely balanced between technical and literary<br/>
allusion - there is something very mystical about the Tolkein and Celtic<br/>
references that seems to fit so well with this sport. Bravo.<br/>
<br/>
Any chance we can see some stamp carvings here, or do I really have to<br/>
travel to OK (actually, 20 below tomorrow night in VT - I'd love to make<br/>
the trip if I could!).<br/>
<br/>
Again, welcome aboard!<br/>
