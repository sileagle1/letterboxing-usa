should be on my home page at <br/>

I am having problems with links any suggestions would be helpful.<br/>

Hal and the Magic Mushroom Letterbox<br/>
Washington, DC<br/>
<br/>
Once upon a time in the Land of Mary, there was a lad named Hal who went<br/>
in search of the magic mushroom. It is told that the magic mushroom<br/>
would lead to his one true love and lots of fun. He began his journey in<br/>
the Capital City with the second wisest wizard of the land. To find his<br/>
home Hal was told to go to Mass and Observe, there he would find the way<br/>
to the old seafaring stargazers home and the second wisest wizard. When<br/>
Hal arrived at the Naval Observers gate he met the wizard who said to<br/>
"look beyond the gray road and follow the yellow brick road to<br/>
Nordstrom’s Place through the woods. When you come to an M carved in a<br/>
tree, kiss it three times, turn around and if your heart is true, your<br/>
declaration of your love will appear." From where he declared his love<br/>
for Mary, a gray squirrel whispered “what you seeks can be found under<br/>
the white stone in the death log just 30 paces from here at 130 degrees.<br/>
Go there and stamp the mushroom two times and see what fun you have<br/>
found in the land of your love."<br/>

wait to get down and try to find them. Hopefully we'll get them <br/>
linked to the LBNA map soon: things are going much quicker now with <br/>
updates. I know that Tom is busy with end-of-the-school-year <br/>
business, and that Randy and John are out of town for the weekend, <br/>
but they'll get up QUICK! Promise! Now, to find an excuse to get down <br/>
to Wheaton.....Jay<br/>

We have updated the Washington DC link on  the MA/DE map and <br/>
added it to the PA and VA maps. I didn't take a lot of care in <br/>
putting the dots on the regional map, so let me know if you'd like to <br/>
see them shifted a little to better show the spots.<br/>
