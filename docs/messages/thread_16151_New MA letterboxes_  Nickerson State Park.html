were in such a tizzy that day that we didn't put the "about<br/>
letterboxing" info in yet.  I will be visiting them as soon as I get<br/>
to Brewster tomorrow.  I've posted them now so that any of you who are<br/>
coming to the Cape Caper can print your own instructions.  I will also<br/>
have copies of the instructions on the table at the event as well as<br/>
directions to many other local boxes and of course the "day only"<br/>
boxes.    Let's hope the weather people are wrong about possible<br/>
showers Saturday afternoon; the Caper is on regardless (rain or<br/>
shine).  Hope to see you there!<br/>

Clues<br/>
Flax Pond Letterbox Series at Nickerson State Park<br/>
<br/>
Number of Boxes: 3<br/>
Placed by Mary Manatee and The Yachtsman<br/>
Location: Nickerson State Park, Brewster, MA<br/>
Clues: easy<br/>
Terrain: variable with some hills<br/>
<br/>
Nickerson State Park in Brewster, MA is located off of Route 6A, about<br/>
1 mile west of Orleans. From the west, make your way to the Sagamore<br/>
Bridge, then take Rte. 6 east to exit 12 in Orleans. Turn left off the<br/>
ramp onto Rte. 6A west towards Brewster and follow signs on 6A to the<br/>
park entrance about 2 miles on your left. From points east, take Route<br/>
6A west from the Orleans rotary. There are many other exits that you<br/>
could take from Route 6 which connect to Route 6A if you want to see<br/>
more of the fantastic Cape Cod scenery, including Rte 134 to East<br/>
Dennis, and Rte 124 or Rte 137 to Brewster. This park is heavily<br/>
visited during the summer months, and supports large stands of poison<br/>
ivy in spots. We avoided placing the boxes in areas that required<br/>
tromping through the ivy!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1. Water Bear Letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Placed on 9/27/03<br/>
<br/>
Some years ago I (Mary) taught a field course for Bentley College that<br/>
visited this part of Nickerson State Park each year to study a typical<br/>
freshwater pond. During one of these class trips, we ran a plankton<br/>
tow in a small pond in this area and came up with some beautiful<br/>
tardigrades, or water bears, for the students to view through a field<br/>
microscope. We have placed the Water Bear Letterbox in this area in<br/>
honor of that find.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: Pick up a trail map at the entrance booth. From there, continue<br/>
straight until you reach the Y intersection, then turn left onto Flax<br/>
Pond Rd (signs say toward the picnic area and boat ramp). Just before<br/>
you reach Keeler Pond there will be a small pull-out on your left.<br/>
Park your car or bike here. A small path heads into the woods (roughly<br/>
north). Climb the path to the end, and turn right onto another trail.<br/>
Go 20 paces east, and you will see a rock on your right . Water Bear<br/>
Letterbox is tucked under some bark and a small log on the east side<br/>
of the rock.<br/>
<br/>
2. Nickerson State Park Letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Placed on 9/27/03<br/>
<br/>
This box is placed near a very distinctive boulder along Flax Pond<br/>
Road that seemed to cry out for a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: This is a "drive-by", "walk-by" or<br/>
"bicycle-by" letterbox with<br/>
one caveat. It is located right off Flax Pond Rd, and this road is<br/>
very busy with cars coming to and from one of the park boat ramps. If<br/>
traveling by car, it would be best to enter the Area 5 campground, and<br/>
park near the Restrooms. From the Water Bear Letterbox, continue down<br/>
Flax Pond Rd until you see a large glacial erratic on your right.<br/>
Approach on foot, and look into the "jaws" of the boulder. The<br/>
Nickerson State Park Letterbox is hidden inside next to a small rock,<br/>
and covered with leaves and pine needles. Please re-hide carefully, as<br/>
this area is heavily used.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3. The Kayaker:<br/>
<br/>
Placed on 9/27/03<br/>
<br/>
Clues: From The Nickerson State Park Letterbox, continue down Flax<br/>
Pond Rd to the Parking area at the Flax Pond Beach. In the summer<br/>
there are restrooms here, but they are closed between Labor Day and<br/>
Memorial Day. From the parking lot, take the Flax Pond Trail. Go right<br/>
at the first fork. Climb over several fallen logs before you reach a<br/>
spot where you first see Flax Pond. Before you get to the pond, you<br/>
will see a standing dead tree split in half on your left. The Kayaker<br/>
Letterbox is hidden inside a cleft on the pond side of the tree under<br/>
leaves and bark. If you take the box and continue down the trail to<br/>
the beach, there is a nice bench above the beach where you can stamp<br/>
in. Please rehide the box carefully.<br/>
Before you set out, please read the waiver of responsibility and<br/>
disclaimer.<br/>
