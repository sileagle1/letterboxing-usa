I don't "chat" (as in on-line chat), but I and my wife do both.  I'm also willing to help, if I can.  Where do you live?  It would be helpful to be close to the situation.  If you're in Massachusetts, say, we're not likely to know the person, as we live in The Golden State.  And Don's suggestion about writing to Groundspeak is a good one; in fact, you should check the Groundspeak forums to see if anyone has posted about this issue.  <br/>

If that link doesn't work, go to geocaching. com, sign in, and then in the<br/>
left column click on "Forums." This will take you to the Groundspeak forum<br/>
site. In the light blue bar that spans the screen under the title, on the<br/>
right side, you will see "Members" as one choice.<br/>

Good luck! I hope you are able to make contact.<br/>
