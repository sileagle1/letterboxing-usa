I don't remember the route number).  You've got to taste their wine!  The Merlot and Cab is to die for!  Also, their Carneros Chardonnay is good too.... and if you like Dessert wines, you've got to try the Moscato D'Oro!  Also, we took the three hour tour (not on a boat like Gilligan) which is expensive, but a real blast!  You get the royal treatment!  You may not be able to get into that tour, I booked far in advance!
<br/>
<br/>Also, if you are into brandy, go to RMS Distillery (a Remy Martin distillery) which is on the route towards Sonoma.  You can go into the aging room there.  When you enter, it is darkly lit, with gregorian chant music piped through the speakers!  Then you catch a whif..... ahhhhhhhh the smell of the aged brandy!  I personally do not like brandy... but that smell......!!!!!!!!  Wow!
<br/>
<br/>Also, Domaine Chandon is a good place to stop.  The tour tells all about champagne making, and you can taste at the end.  If you can, go to Sterling Vineyards, especially if their new tour center is finished.  It is on top of the mountain, and you can only get there by one of those flying gondola things (?  like at Disney World.... you know... the skyway).  I personally like their regular Merlot and their Diamond Mountain Ranch Merlot.

<br/>Have fun in Wine Country!  I'd love to hear about your adventures when you get back!

<div>Jay,</div>
<div>I'm also near the wine country and have just 
started letterboxing. (And loving it). But, there aren't too many boxes up in 
this area. Are you planting some more around here? </div>
<div>And the weather in this part of the country is 
perfect right now. Suppose to be 70 today.</div>

<br/>
About 10+ years ago my husband and I discovered this winery while <br/>
driving the backroads. When we walked into the place they had heavy <br/>
metal music blaring away, and once they discovered that they had <br/>
some customers the music immediately changed to classical. We had a <br/>
good laugh, and they did too. Their place was such a contrast to the <br/>
more famous vineyards of that time. Their place was rustic, but cozy <br/>
and welcoming(I hope that it still is). I don't know if they are <br/>
still into the heavy metal, but I can state that they produce <br/>
stupendous wine. <br/>
