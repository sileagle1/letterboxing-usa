&gt;We will be travelling through Seattle and will propbably do the<br/>
&gt;standard Seattle tourist stuff like Pike Place and Space Needle. Can<br/>
&gt;anyone recommend any nearby boxes that would fit in well?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wooo!  You had me all kinds of excited there for a few seconds.  I was two <br/>
seconds from springing from the chair while the clues printed, hopping the <br/>
bike and going to find the downtown boxes! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, there aren't any actually located in the touristy areas, <br/>
though that would be a REALLY fun series, and I keep thinking it's one that <br/>
I should do when i get a chance.  Depending on when you'll be here, there <br/>
should be an Eastlake series (a few minutes from downtown, on Lake Union), <br/>
and there are quite a few parks that are between 10 and 15 minutes from the <br/>
Needle/Market type areas that have boxes.  (Ravenna, Carkeek, Me Kwa Mooks, <br/>
Schmitz, Discovery, Camp Long...)<br/>
<br/>
And if you give us dates, maybe the Seattle Contingent of the IALC can come <br/>
up with SOMETHING downtown....<br/>
