<p>Elliott Station to Abington, Airline Trail</p>
<p>Both letterboxes are in the town of Pomfret Connecticut, Windham County and 
on the same abandoned rail line. To do both boxes will be 4 miles round 
trip.</p>

<p>Location: Pomfret Connecticut, Windham County</p>
<p>Rated: Moderate</p>
<p>Elliott Station</p>
<p>Coming from Route 6, take route 97 through Hampton Center. Stay on Route 97 
as it goes out of Hampton. You will see a sign on the right stating that you are 
entering Pomfret. Take the 2<sup>nd </sup>right after seeing the town line sign. 
This is Brooklyn Road. You will see. small signs at the corner for candle and 
molding shops. If coming from Rt. 44, go down Route 97 towards Hampton and this 
will be the second left after the ice cream stand which is also on the left. A 
few houses down on the left stands a large gold color house with a rock in front 
of it engraved Elliott Station circa 1870. There is parking on the right side of 
the road for several cars. Walk towards the Elliott station house. It looks like 
a dirt road or driveway. Walk down this trail past the house. Pass the shadow 
man leaning against a tree on the right. You will come to an abandoned green 
house and a green car barrier across the path. Go past this and you will be 
walking on the old airline railroad line. You will travel about a mile from this 
point to get to the first box so I will leave a lot of small details out. Keep 
on the track bed. On the right you will come to a sign stating: New England 
Forestry Foundation and No Hunting signs. Keep going on the rail line. You will 
see a distinct left turn in the track. Along this curve you will see two 
evergreens on the right growing one behind the other close together, about 8 
feet from the old track. On the left directly across the track from these two 
evergreens is a rock out cropping and ledge going up hill from the track. Stand 
in the middle of the track between the nearest tree of the two evergreens and 
the rock on your left. Take a reading of 270 degrees. This is where you must go 
up the steep embankment to a large rock about 10 feet off the trail. To the left 
of that rock is a small group of rocks. The letterbox is there. It is not 
completely covered but because of the height cannot be see from the rail bed. If 
you somehow go more than 25 feet away from the old track, you definitely passed 
it. This area is the only area of rock outcroppings on the left and a couple of 
medium height close evergreens on the right on the route thus far. After finding 
this box continue in the same direction to the Abington On The Air line 
letterbox. </p>
<p>Abington On The Air line</p>
<p>The curve on the trail gradually turns to a straight trail. Keep going until 
the rail line goes under a road. Facing the bridge over head, go to the right 
concrete corner of the wall holding up bridge. You do not have to go under the 
bridge. Follow the concrete up the hill as though you are going to go up to the 
road. You will see mid way up that there are 2 large man cut blocks of stone 
with a gap between them. Near the top of the right cut stone between the two 
stones is the Abington On The Air Line letterbox. It is covered by 1 flat rock. 
It could have leaves or other debris over it because it is on a slope of a hill. 
After finding this box, follow the rail line back to your car. It will be a two 
mile walk from here. </p></div></body></html>
