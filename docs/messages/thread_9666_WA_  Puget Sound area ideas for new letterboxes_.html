<br/>
     Ok--so the Pacific NW weather has been a bit miserable lately <br/>
(although I love the rain) &amp; we've all managed to carve many, many <br/>
stamps for letterboxes that are just begging to be placed sometime <br/>
soon...<br/>
<br/>
     Are you looking for places to hide a few new letterboxes around <br/>
the Puget Sound???  A few of us Puget Sounders (is that a legitimate <br/>
term?) have discussed interesting and unique locations around the <br/>
Puget Sound that might provide neat hiding spots for letterboxes <br/>
(many of them are as of now 'unboxed' that we know of).  I found <br/>
some links to articles/websites on various places that seem quite <br/>
interesting and might be great spots for future letterboxes.  If <br/>
you're interested, here goes (please feel free to add to this list <br/>
if you have any other ideas):<br/>

many of these but there still remain many others on the list):<br/>

**Helps you locate hard to find facts about historical events in the <br/>
area.  This site has been indispensable in helping me research the <br/>
facts behind several of my historical letterboxes.  Absolutely <br/>
incredible site if you're looking for those hard to find tidbits of <br/>
Pacific Northwest history!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find this useful and/or interesting! I'm sure I'll hear <br/>
about it if you don't...  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the letterboxing trails!  <br/>
