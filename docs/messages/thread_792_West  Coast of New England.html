                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Susan, so nice of you to respond! Think further west to locate my<br/>
"North Country". I'm a bit south of Watertown NY and a few miles from<br/>
the Lake Ontario shore in Pierrepont Manor...not all maps warrant us<br/>
however...Pop.350! I have some great ideas for box locations since I<br/>
have lived in several regions of NY, including near you, in Granville<br/>
NY. Today, after spending an unspeakable amount of time carving my<br/>
first eraser those great ideas are now on a snail's pace to reality. I<br/>
chuckled when I read Erica's reply to Martha in Ohio, I can easily<br/>
envision myself carving stamps as my new winter pastime too! Tell me<br/>
one thing all you experts out there!!! How do I reattach a tiny but<br/>
vital part of my design? I tried crazy glue and I'll leave the result<br/>
of that endeavor to your imaginations! I can't bear throwing my hard<br/>
work out, do other Lbxrs kids use mutilated erasers in school? I'm<br/>
looking forward to Mystic and hope to see you there! Robin<br/>
