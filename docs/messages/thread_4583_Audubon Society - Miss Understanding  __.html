of 2 boxes at an Audubon Park in RI.  I was very disappointed to hear <br/>
the news.  I said I would place a box this weekend in defiance.  <br/>
However, I DID NOT mean in an Audubon Park.  I will be placing a <br/>
letterboxbox entitled "defiance" this weekend.  It will be located on <br/>
public property.  Free access to anyone who chooses to stamp in.  <br/>
Actually ... I plan on placing several boxes this weekend including a <br/>
HH (wink-wink-nudge-nudge)  I hope this will entice some of you to <br/>
come down to Fairfield County for a letterboxing expedition.  Keep <br/>
your eyes open :)<br/>
