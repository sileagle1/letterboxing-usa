I am making a trip to Elizabeth City NC for a week.  I would love to <br/>
meet some of the east coast boxers and collect a few stamps from <br/>
that area.  I will be available to letterbox probably on sunday the <br/>
10th and perhaps monday the 11th.  I will be visiting family and my <br/>
time will be limited but I have confirmed time to take my 2 neices <br/>
and gather a few stamps.  I will also be planting a few boxes and <br/>
hitchhikers as well.  I will have my computer with me so I will be <br/>
able to check email and keep up with the list.  If I can't meet up <br/>
with anyone help with which boxes are in the area would be much <br/>
appreciated.  I think we will be going to the outter banks and <br/>
perhaps a few of the light houses in the area.  Probably not more <br/>
than a couple hours in any one direction.  Any help will be <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sleepy Whippet<br/>
