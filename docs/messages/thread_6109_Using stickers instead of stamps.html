Has there ever been any discussion about applying a self-adhesive <br/>
sticker instead of applying an ink stamp in a box's log book? It <br/>
would allow for a greater variety of artwork, I should think.<br/>

The limestone box hidden by the shorewood folks in western MO has stickers.  <br/>
We thought they were a great variation!  I don't think that the sticker idea <br/>
is too far off the original "business card" letterbox.  However, If the box <br/>
gets wet that might not be good for the stickers.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,  I have recently started stamping white stick on labels ahead of <br/>
time and using these at the letterbox.  I got the idea from Trish <br/>
Kurdziel.  The reason I have started doing it is I like to use <br/>
different color inks on my stamp and then also color it in after the <br/>
ink dries.  This takes a lot of time.  When sitting in the woods <br/>
being eated by hungry mosquitos (and worse) the time for the ink to <br/>
dry feels like an eternity.   Now I stamp in the leisure of my <br/>
airconditioned house and simply apply the label at the letterbox.  <br/>
saves lots of time (and bug bites) and I get a better quality <br/>
stamping because if the stamp image smears I just throw that label <br/>
away.  I hadn't thought of what happens of the box gets wet, but I <br/>
have seen some unreadable wet box journal where the ink was smeared <br/>
anyway.<br/>
