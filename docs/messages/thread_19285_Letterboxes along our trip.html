                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are leaving from OK in a few days for PA, NY &amp; Washington DC.  We <br/>
have found letterboxes in the areas we will be visiting but were <br/>
interested in some along the road as we go and come back.<br/>
<br/>
We will be traveling through IL and IN on I-70 and will be returning <br/>
from VA through TN &amp; AR on 64/81 and then I-40.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone know of any boxes that would be easily found along that <br/>
route.  We're just thinking of places to stop to stretch our legs and <br/>
picnic that we could do some letterboxing as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.  We're new to the sport and group (f - 19 and P -<br/>
5)  My brother in Kansas City and Mother in OK are both way ahead of <br/>
us.  <br/>
<br/>
Have a great day.<br/>

Have you looked at the Columbus OH boxes at all?  All of the ones I have<br/>
found are fantastic, but I especially like the Art in Public Places series<br/>
and Book bug's Friendship series.<br/>
<br/>
For a great hike, even tho you do not get a box immediately, check out<br/>
"Shh..its a secret", also listed with the Columbus OH boxes.<br/>

Thanks for the suggestions.  We're going to be staying in West Salem one night so maybe we can try some of these.<br/>
