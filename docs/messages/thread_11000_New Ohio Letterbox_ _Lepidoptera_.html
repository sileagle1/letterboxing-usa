Title: Lepidoptera. Location: Paint Creek State Park, Ross County, <br/>
Ohio. Placed 3-2-03 by Salamander. Difficulty: Moderate. **Please <br/>
bring a stamp pad. Driving directions: US-50 to Rapid Forge Road; <br/>
then 2 miles on Rapid Forge Rd. to park entrance. Follow entrance <br/>
road .5 mile, then turn left.Take this road to the parking area below <br/>
the spillway.  CLUES: From the west end of the parking area, head <br/>
down the trail past the "Warning-Blast of Horn...." sign. Proceed <br/>
until you come to some wire "netting" attached to the cliff face to <br/>
your left.Stop. Here is where you will need to go backward in order <br/>
to go forward in your letterbox quest. From where you stopped at the <br/>
beginning of the wire netting, turn around and backtrack for 24 <br/>
paces.Stop. Face south. There should be a large stone outcropping, <br/>
which looks somewhat like a buffalo head, just ahead of you and to <br/>
the left. (O.K., maybe I have a vivid imagination here.)Ten feet to <br/>
the right of the buffalo head is a tree. A Lepidoptera is hiding at <br/>
the base of the tree behind a rock.<br/>
