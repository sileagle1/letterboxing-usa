&gt; Subject: Webmaster - CA box is missing<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recently went looking for the "Leafy" box in San Francisco's Golden Gate<br/>
&gt; park - unsuccessfully.  The clues were clear and led us to a spot where we<br/>
&gt; were sure something *used* to be hidden, but no box was found.  There were<br/>
&gt; some trees that had been planted up to within a few feet of the hiding spot,<br/>
&gt; so we wondered if the box had been discovered and removed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The clues page didn't have contact info for the people who placed the box.<br/>
&gt; Can those clues be updated or removed?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm new to this list, but happy to know it exists.  Are there any other<br/>
&gt; Central California letterboxers lurking here?  I live in Santa Cruz County,<br/>
&gt; and have found that my area is woefully light of boxes...there is one in the<br/>
&gt; entire county!  That will soon change....<br/>
