I assume Turkey Run State Park is out of your way, but it has some of the<br/>
best hiking in the state.<br/>

Can anyone recommend some specific letterboxes that are located on longer<br/>
hikes in interesting areas in southern and/or eastern Indiana or northern<br/>
Kentucky?<br/>
<br/>
We'll be driving from southern IL to an event in northeastern Indiana and<br/>

I think totalling over 30 miles worth. There are 3 letterboxes hidden there, that I know of. Look under Bardstown on AtlasQuest. <br/>
<br/>
Have a safe trip!<br/>
