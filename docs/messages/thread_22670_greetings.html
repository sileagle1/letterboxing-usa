Just wanted to say hi and thanks.  I'm a relative newbie, but nope I <br/>
don't have any repetitive questions. ;-) <br/>
<br/>
I'm having loads of fun LBing and looking forward to more, so I <br/>
don't have of those newbie Qs, but just wanted to pipe up to say <br/>
that info, encouragement, and resources for newbies are much <br/>
appreciated.  My profound thanks to the site and talk list keepers <br/>
for all your work so that I and so many others can have some fun!  <br/>
What a labor of love.<br/>
<br/>
I've particularly found some of the polls interesting, especially <br/>
the latest re: notifying placer and what folks especially like when <br/>
hunting down LBs since I just placed my first one and have a few <br/>
more in the works here in Denver. Quite helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers and happy boxing.<br/>

<br/>
In case you are not aware, there is a board called "newboxers" for<br/>
questions new 'boxers may have.  This was set up by Mark Pepe to<br/>
reduce the number of repetitive questions on this board.  Please feel<br/>
free to post any and all questions you have on that board --<br/>
regardless of whether they've already been asked.  A number of more<br/>
"seasoned" letterboxers prowl that board and are happy to answer the<br/>
questions for you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to see this hobby spreading and the number of letterboxes<br/>
increasing across the nation.  Of course, there are now plenty of<br/>
letterboxes that I'll never get, but I look forward to the day when I<br/>
can find a few outside of New England.  Hmmm, based on my current "F"<br/>
count (435) and the number of letterboxes in the six New England<br/>
states (3,297 as listed on LbNA plus countless WOM boxes) it might be<br/>
awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway ... welcome again!<br/>
<br/>

Hi Her<br/>
Here is a little tidbit for you. Sometimes letterbox clues are <br/>
hidden in the chat list posts. There are occasions when <br/>
that "annoying" question is really part of a clue series.All of <br/>
those can be researched by going through the list archives if you <br/>
have a spare couple of days. There are other times when flames <br/>
aren't really flames. When ever you see something that doesn't quite <br/>
fit you might want to check a little more thoroughly. The same thing <br/>
can be said about links and files.<br/>
