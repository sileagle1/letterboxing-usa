&gt; Im going to remove myself from this group, as the attitude of some<br/>
of the<br/>
&gt; members towards new people seems to be something I dont care to<br/>
associate<br/>
&gt; with. There seems to be a feeling amongst some, that people should<br/>
spend<br/>
&gt; many hours learning and researching letterboxing. I am the mother<br/>
of two<br/>
&gt; boys. One is epileptic. I work as a Registered Veterinary<br/>
Technician, do<br/>
&gt; portrait photography, and teach scrapbooking classes, all on the<br/>
weekends,<br/>
&gt; just to try to earn a little extra money for the family. I also<br/>
homeschool<br/>
&gt; these boys, am Secretary for the Scout Pack and act as taxi driver<br/>
for the<br/>
&gt; activities they are involved in. The fact that I might have about 1<br/>
hour a<br/>
&gt; day of down time doesnt seem to matter to those such as phyto. Do<br/>
I ask<br/>
&gt; for easy answers. If its truly an important, life-changing or<br/>
life-saving<br/>
&gt; item I need information for, Ill search all night long. But this<br/>
is fun?<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing is NOT something that will cause the sky to fall. Should<br/>
&gt; people follow the rules. Certainly, but I witness many people not<br/>
following<br/>
&gt; rules everyday. Maybe having all the rules and other need to know<br/>
&gt; information easily at our fingertips makes life a little easier for<br/>
those of<br/>
&gt; us to dont spend our time putting down those who have just discovered<br/>
&gt; something and are excited about learning as quickly as possible,<br/>
about it.<br/>
&gt; I hope you learn what is truly important and put that angry energy into<br/>
&gt; discovering the cure for cancer or something like that. Happy<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; Ill tell all the newbies to stay away from this group.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ... otherwise, you have to go digging through the Links<br/>
section, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if someone's already over-excited about this, they're going to just<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; burst right in and not think to explore that spooky blue<br/>
section over<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Let's dilute our hobby some more.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hand outs and spoons please...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Those who are truly dedicated might think about using their time<br/>
&gt; &gt; wisely to create an alphabetized index of the topics contained within<br/>
&gt; &gt; the yahoo_LBNA talk list such as I have seen for many other groups in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my time. It might be a very worthwhile endeavour for those too lazy to<br/>
&gt; &gt; search the scarey blue section that includes using a few bits of grey<br/>
&gt; &gt; matter.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Here's a great example of an indexed listing of a Yahoo talk group<br/>
&gt; &gt; (non-letterboxing related) maintained by a dedicated member (who also<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably got sick of telling the newbies where to search for<br/>
information).<br/>
&gt; &gt; http://sunnisan.com/ppr/a.html<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Since when did letterboxing not involve some searching????<br/>
