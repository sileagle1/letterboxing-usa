<br/>
The First Annual Thanksgiving Letterbox is located at Priest Point Park<br/>
in Olympia, Washington on Easy Bay Drive, just two miles north from<br/>
downtown.  This park got its name because it was the site of a Catholic<br/>
mission that was opened in 1848. The Mission closed in 1860, and the<br/>
city bought the property in 1906.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the clues:<br/>
<br/>
Upon entering the park, stop and smell the roses.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One slight correction to these clues.  Priest Point Park is located on<br/>
East Bay Drive, not Easy Bay Drive.  I guess that would be a different<br/>
place entirely!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;From the center head east and join the Garden Club.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Turn your back on the Woods and cross the bridge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cross the road and keep on the trail.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pass the knotty snag.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 27 steps past a branch to the left, you will find the treasure within<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; Maple tree of three, host to moss and ivy.<br/>
