Tiverton, RI<br/>

Planted by:  Laurette<br/>

Terrain: gentle and kid-friendly<br/>
Length:  a leisurely hour or so<br/>
Comments:  a great place to birdwatch<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions:  From Providence, take Route 195 east to Route 24 south <br/>
(in Fall River, MA). Travel Route 24 south to the Route 77 south exit. Follow <br/>
Route 77 south to Seapowet Avenue. (.  From Newport and points west, take 138 <br/>
east to Route 77 south to Seapowet Avenue.)  Turn right at Seapowet Avenue <br/>
and continue down hill to the refuge parking lot on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  From the parking lot.  Take the red trail, which can be found in the <br/>
NE corner of the parking lot.  Stay on the red until you reach the yellow <br/>
trail.  A right on the yellow will take you on a short loop of the peninsula <br/>
and back here.  (well worth it)  Take the yellow generally SSE until you <br/>
reach the blue trail.  Follow the blue over the bridge to the fork.  At the <br/>
fork take 20 steps along the left branch and spy the second shadbush <br/>
(multi-curlicu trunks) on the left of the trail.  The Great Blue is nestled <br/>
snugly on the far side of the bush.  The blue trail continues around the <br/>
peninsula.  South on yellow will lead you out to the parking area.<br/>
