in which a black bear swiped at and scratched a 5-year-old Gloucester <br/>
City boy is the first documented instance of a person being injured <br/>
by a black bear in recent New Jersey history. Billy Jacobs was hiking <br/>
Friday with his two sisters and their father, Bill Jacobs, 35, a <br/>
drywall finisher, when they encountered the bear and fed it a bagel. <br/>
The 130-pound bear then became aggressive and lashed out at Billy. <br/>

This piece of an article was cut a pasted from an article from July <br/>
4th, 2001.  I'm not a subsciber to the paper so I can't get the whole <br/>
article. However, if I remember correctly, wildlife officials plant <br/>
to hunt down and kill the bear.  <br/>
<br/>
IMHO I think the people should be fined for feeding and provoking the <br/>
bear in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
The incident occured on Mt. Tammany, New Jersey.  I think there's a <br/>
box planted there.  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely!<br/>
<br/>
In fact I think we have laws to that effect down here in Florida. <br/>
Many an alligator has had to be destroyed because it was fed and <br/>
became aggressive towards humans. Once animals view us as a source of <br/>
food they do what comes natural.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You're right about the letterbox.  I just stamped into the Mount <br/>
Tammany Letterbox on Saturday.  <br/>
<br/>
You're also on the mark about being fined.  It was just in the news <br/>
this morning.  The father is being brought up on charges by the state <br/>
wildlife officials.  He could receive up to a $2000+ fine if <br/>
convicted.<br/>
<br/>
I was going to mention that I went up there, but have been busy <br/>
lately.  The trail was pretty busy on Saturday when I climbed for the <br/>
box.  I didn't see any bears in the park but I got a shot of a mother <br/>
and her cub from my car as I was driving there.  I spooked two <br/>
whitetail fawns right by the letterbox on top of the mountain.  The <br/>
views were great and the Low-bush blueberries were just starting to <br/>
ripen.  It's going to be good pickens for the next couple of weeks <br/>
for anyone who likes blueberries.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest danger to hikers right now on the Red Dot trail is <br/>
several steel leg-hold traps that have been set at various points off <br/>
the trail near the sight of the incident in an attempt to catch the <br/>
bear.  They're are pretty good sets and can't be seen from the trail <br/>
where they've posted signs warning hikers not to approach them.  I <br/>
hope some curious greenhorn doesn't go snooping around and get his <br/>
leg broken.<br/>

Never underestimate the stupidity of an adult male human. Did "Dad"<br/>
figure that his son might make nice to the little bear and be its'<br/>
best buddy? So now the bear dies because someone didn't have enough<br/>
brains to blow his own nose - but as they say - that's just my<br/>
opinion.<br/>

Okay what are we thinking?<br/>
<br/>
KILL THE PEOPLE NOT THE BEAR!<br/>
<br/>
Stupidity should not be encouraged!  This is an actual<br/>
clip from the dialog preceeding the attack:<br/>
<br/>
BILLY: Daddy can I give the bear a bagel.<br/>
<br/>
Bill: Sure, Billy that would be cute.<br/>
<br/>
Billy: Here, wild and ferocious bear of the woods,<br/>
have this plain bagel that we brought you from<br/>
STARBUCKS.<br/>
<br/>
BEAR: STARBUCKS? That's crap, I wanted a Dunkin Donuts<br/>
bagel, and jeez, theres no PEANUT BUTTER, OH THAT'S IT<br/>
!  (DIRECTED TO BIG BILL:) I'm going to eat your<br/>
entire family for this, starting with that weasel who<br/>
tried to feed me STARBUKS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on people, in this instance I condone Federal<br/>
policy regarding the control of breeding practices<br/>
amongst dumb people!<br/>
