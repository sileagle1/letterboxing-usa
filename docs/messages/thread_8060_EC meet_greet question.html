I do have a question about one of the things I stamped in my book.  I <br/>
can't remember who sent the "Virginia is for Lovers" HH to the <br/>

so that my book will be complete.  <br/>

Thanks for the great day<br/>

<br/>
The "Virginia is for Lovers &amp; Boxers" HH was created by and sent to <br/>
the gathering by LuLuphi who wasn't able to be there but contributed <br/>
not only the HH, but the incredible "Flutterby" by leger de maine.  <br/>
