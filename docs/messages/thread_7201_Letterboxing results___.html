&gt; I am doing some maintaining of several of my letterboxes.  I have <br/>

&gt; 4.  90 degrees and 90 percent humidity puts a damper of how far I can <br/>
&gt; run through the woods to and from letterboxes.  (And a 2 liter bottle <br/>
&gt; of diet coke does not last a full afternoon.)<br/>

LECTURE TIME, geo! Diet Coke is baaaaad to take on such a hot, humid day! <br/>
Ya need WATER (the caffeine and the aspartame in DC are both diuretics,<br/>
depleting your body of much needed H2O, yadda yadda yadda!) LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I'll be updating your clues this evening -- thanks for the update, and<br/>
especially for the "lessons learned"! One of my boxes (River Bend) was<br/>
washed away when a nearby river flooded its banks two springs ago, and<br/>
another (Jabberwocky) is pretty much covered by those "leaves of three,"<br/>
and I am sure I am personally responsible for the stock market increase<br/>
of Calamine Lotion!<br/>
