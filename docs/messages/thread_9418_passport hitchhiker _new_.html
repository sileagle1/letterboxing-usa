The passport hitchhiker wants to travel to all 50 states. Its stamp is<br/>
like a passport -- before it is placed in a state it has never visited, you<br/>
carve the two letter state abbreviation into an empty space in the stamp's<br/>
grid to indicate its visit to that state (if it visits some place that is <br/>
not a US state, no change to the stamp is made). If you find it, and don't <br/>
feel like dealing with the carving, count it as a find and leave it there, <br/>
or move it to another box in the same state.<br/>
<br/>
See http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box51.html for more details.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Someone else I know had the same idea (independently), with a different<br/>
implementation.  Hopefully one or the other will head your direction ...<br/>
