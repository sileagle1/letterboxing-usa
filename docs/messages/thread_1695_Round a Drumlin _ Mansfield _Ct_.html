that when a Round a Drumlin you go a suprise will wait for those who <br/>
go. So thanks for kindness it does grow ,now walk this Drumlin high <br/>
and low.A afternoon of fun, barns close at 4. From your Friends in <br/>
the Cock-A-Doodle-Moo 4-H Club.<br/>
   On the campus of Uconn track to the top of the Hill. <br/>
Rte 195 you take,  students rush there still.<br/>
   Turn onto Horsebarn Hill Rd. between coops and a barn old red.<br/>
The Kellogg Dairy facility,  you should start I said.<br/>
   Each place a worthy visit here<br/>
Plan to spend some of that time so dear.<br/>
   You may see  a cow named Amy, all black and white.<br/>
They cloned her here at Uconn ,what a special sight.<br/>
    ( restrooms available here, your walk will return you to this <br/>
point)<br/>
<br/>
   Out the door and take a right down the hill you go<br/>
Looking for white fences and barns in a valley low.<br/>
   First you see a cow barn, greenhouse style is new.<br/>
Then where piggies live to walk past ,and polo ring to view.<br/>
   The beef and sheep are at home ,they live here on the left<br/>
Young horses cavort in paddocks  where they eat grow and rest.<br/>
   Onward to the horse barns on the right<br/>
See the pretty Morgans once used for a battles fight<br/>
   After the horse barn look for a special stone<br/>
If it could roar you are in the right spot. <br/>
   You could  set a spell or continue on up the hill<br/>
No path here along the trees just up then up more still<br/>
    A little dirt road goes left and right here<br/>
Take a walk to sight the horse barn from here.<br/>
    Some where now , hidden  on  a stone cold day<br/>
Where Racoon track in snow did lay.<br/>
    Your quest is hidden set close to earth<br/>
As if it would have roots and limbs after it sprouts.<br/>
    Where it sits the shadow falls<br/>
And has fallen for ages all. <br/>
    Stamping up here so the barn crew won't see<br/>
Return it to its den so no one can see<br/>
   Now on the dirt road go back as you came<br/>
Not down the hill that part is  not the same<br/>
   Around the drumlin the road does go<br/>
Stop at the back of the George White ,the Dairy Bar ... do go<br/>
    Now there is a road back to the top<br/>
Not 195 but between equip shed and building stop.<br/>
   This access road  will safely take you to your car <br/>
See the barns ,the hilltop is not far. <br/>
   Hope you enjoy the mini tour of the Universities agricultural <br/>
features. It is the  schools heritage and the future of quality food <br/>
at affordable prices as  farmland is destroyed in the name of <br/>
progress. Here is the training ground for agriculturalists. People <br/>
who have a belief that there is a way to produce more food on less <br/>
land for less cost with minimum help, are these not the most <br/>
determined people who so quietly provide for each and every one of us <br/>
on a daily basis.  Appreciate the  beauty of the Drumlin this very <br/>
special hill and the farm here ,started by the Storrs brothers and <br/>
givin to the state as a site for a agricultural college, the roots of <br/>
Uconn. <br/>
