<div>I planted a new box today on 
the Nat'l Park Service (NPS) Mount Vernon Trail. You can ride your bike, 
jog, or walk the 18.5-mile, paved trail from Mount Vernon, the home of George 
Washington, to Theodore Roosevelt Island (there are 2 boxes on the island). This 
will be a prime trail for multiple boxes along it's length, and I invite 
Squirrel and Mad Piper, or anyone other letterboxing coming this way, to 
add to the series.</div>

<div><strong>Runway </strong>Letterbox clues will be posted, by 
tomorrow night at <a href="http://www.1bigred.com/jayc/letterbox/mvt.htm#Runway">www.1bigred.com/jayc/letterbox/mvt.htm#Runway</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>This first location is a way 
cool, on Gravelly point, north of Reagan National Airport. The planes fly about 
100 feet over your head on their way in landing to the south. My clues will also 
include radio scanning frequencies so you can sit in the parking lot and watch 
and listen to the takeoff and landing ballet before you.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Awesome, Jay! When we were down in October for the MCM (Marine Corps <br/>
Marathon: proudly wore my "finisher" shirt in to work this morning) <br/>
we had hoped to box either Gravely Point or Lady Bird's Wildflower <br/>
Park. Unfortunatly I couldn't take another step after the race. We <br/>
were lucky enough to find Squirrel's "Teddy" box with its truly <br/>
amazing stamp the day before. You are so right that this trail is a <br/>
letterbox magnet. Can't wait to get back. For anyone with a "real" <br/>
excuse to visit the nation's capital, don't forget your compass!<br/>
