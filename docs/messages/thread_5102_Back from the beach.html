Beach (Horry County), SC. Clues are also on our site at: <br/>

<br/>
**Sculptured Oak**<br/>
<br/>
A single letterbox: two easy miles, about one hour, on a quiet <br/>
respite from the honky-tonk commerce of the "Grand Strand."<br/>
<br/>
Directions: in Myrtle Beach State Park on Rte. 17, just south of the <br/>
airport. This park charges a nominal fee.<br/>
<br/>
On entering Myrtle Beach State Park, swing around a right-turning <br/>
bend and park near the Sculptured Oak Trail sign. Hike in on the <br/>
trail and soon fork west-northwest towards the pond. Cross a little <br/>
footbridge and turn left to peek at the pond. Double back over the <br/>
little bridge and turn south to regain the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Soon you'll find another intersection: turn northwest to the next <br/>
(confusing) intersection. Stay right -west- and in about 10 minutes <br/>
cross a small bridge with handrails onto a sandy, leaf-strewn trail. <br/>
About 30 steps along, find a faint deer-trail to the east and a multi-<br/>
trunked tree. The Sculptured Oak Letterbox is behind, under a fallen <br/>
branch.<br/>
<br/>
A short bit further along the trail finds you on the beach at Shelter <br/>
6. You can either retrace your way back on the trail or turn left to <br/>
explore the wonderful pier. On the way, you'll pass another trail <br/>
entrance that makes a loop back to that confusing intersection, or <br/>
you can just follow the road across from the pier a short way to your <br/>
car.<br/>
<br/>
Now off to putt-putt golfing!<br/>
