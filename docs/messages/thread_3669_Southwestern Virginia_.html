<div>Welcome Ben,</div>
<div>I am up in Fredericksburg 
and take care of the clues on the LbNA site for VA and a dozen more states. The 
state map on letterboxing.org is up to date. You are correct is stating that 
there aren't any boxes near you. I was the one who planted the Mt. Rogers boxes 
last Feb. I think the lack of boxes nearby is a real problem for some people, 
but my advice is to do what I did. Plant some. My count is P47 F26 right 
now because I made a decision to get out in my area and plant. This has 
slowly brought a few more boxes into my area also, not as many as I would like 
but a few.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And this is how LBing will 
grow in your area.  Like the movie saying..   If you plant them 
they will come..  Personnelly I enjoy the planting and clue writting almost 
as much as adding another stamp to my log.</div>
