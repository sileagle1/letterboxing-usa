<br/>
I am an educator at a middle school in Malden, Massachusetts. This <br/>
semester I'd like to have my kids try out letterboxing as a project. <br/>
I love the hobby and I think it is very educational for this age-<br/>
group. I would really like, however, to find someone who has more <br/>
experience in Letterboxing than myself who might be willing to share <br/>
what they know with my students.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I envision a guest speaker who can donate 45 minutes of <br/>
their time and who reach the school I work at in the afternoon here <br/>
in Malden. <br/>
<br/>
If this opportunity sounds interesting to you, please reply to <br/>
either this posting or directly to me at mcrooks@malden.mec.edu.<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to hearing from you,<br/>
Morgan Crooks<br/>
