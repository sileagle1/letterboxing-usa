I adopted Fred, a shepherd dog mix. <br/>
<br/>
A friend said I was wrong in letting Fred drink water from the toilet: "There's a lot of germs and bacteria even in a clean toilet." <br/>
<br/>
I see no harm in it. Am I wrong? Fred also has a pail of fresh water outside. <br/>

Would you drink out of your toilet? If not, then why let your dog? Bacteria from what you void into the toilet, along with grease from the food you eat, coat the sides of the toilet. <br/>
<br/>
That's why people regularly scrub and disinfect the bowl. <br/>
<br/>
I doubt that you have such a spotless toilet that its water is drinkable; if you do, then your dog is probably also drinking disinfectant. So, please, close the lid and give your dog a bowl of fresh water in the house. <br/>
