<br/>HIllsborough County

<br/>There is an entrance fee of $3.25 per carload to the park.  Go to the #2 
<br/>parking lot.  Enter the trail by the Prayer of the Woods sign.  Trail dead 
<br/>ends at river where there is a small shelter.  Go left, or west and continue 
<br/>on trail along the river.  Cross bridge to other side of river, passing 
<br/>memorial stone on your left.   Trail soon turns east and follows the river.  
<br/>Pass a palm tree that is growing along the ground and up over the middle of 
<br/>the path.  Continue following trail as it turns to the north.  You will come 
<br/>to some Cypress knees in the very middle of the path.  Mark of 30 paces from 
<br/>the knees and you will see a huge oak tree to your left.  Go behind the tree 
<br/>and look in small hollow.</body></html>
