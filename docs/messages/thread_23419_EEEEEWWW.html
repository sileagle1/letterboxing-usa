I would "google" these two terms for comparative photos:  "em rash" <br/>
and "poison ivy rash".  Click on the top link for each search; great <br/>
pix. :p <br/>
If what you have is not poison ivy, then it may be Erythema Migrans <br/>
(EM) which is indicative of Lyme Disease (LD).  Note Well:  EM <br/>
doesn't always show up as a nice, neat, classic "bullseye rash", it <br/>
can resemble poison ivy.  And it may not be at the bite site IF it <br/>
even shows up, some folx with LD don't get the rash.  Don't mess with <br/>
LD it can be some serious shi-ite.  A simple blood test can detect LD <br/>
but the Western Blot is more reliable.<br/>

I would "google" these two terms for comparative photos:  "em rash" <br/>
and "poison ivy rash".  Click on the top link for each search; great <br/>
pix. :p <br/>
If what you have is not poison ivy, then it may be Erythema Migrans <br/>
(EM) which is indicative of Lyme Disease (LD).  Note Well:  EM <br/>
doesn't always show up as a nice, neat, classic "bullseye rash", it <br/>
can resemble poison ivy.  And it may not be at the bite site IF it <br/>
even shows up, some folx with LD don't get the rash.  Don't mess with <br/>
LD it can be some serious shi-ite.  A simple blood test can detect LD <br/>
but the Western Blot is more reliable.<br/>
