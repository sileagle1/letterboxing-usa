event and I enjoyed it immensly!!!  I also want to add it was only my <br/>
second encounter with other boxers and everyone was so pleasant and <br/>
eager to share!  I was also amazed at how many out of staters made the <br/>
trek.  Thank you to all the LB committee for making the event such a <br/>
hit!  I can't wait for the next!!!  Special thanx to Maine <br/>
Kokopellian, Oceanwytch, Nautilus &amp; Culex and Cooties!  <br/>
