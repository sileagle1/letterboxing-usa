It has come to my attention that my two Letterboxes in St. <br/>
Petersburg, Florida are not represented on the LBNA website map.  I <br/>
guess they never made it over from the What's New Page.  For Those <br/>
Folks who will be traveling to Florida this summer or for any Newbies <br/>
in the Florida area, here are the clues for those boxes again:<br/>

Weedon Island Preserve, St. Petersburg, Florida<br/>
<br/>
Weedon Island is located on Tampa Bay in Pinellas County. The <br/>
entrance of the Preserve can be found on the west side of the Gandy <br/>
Bridge (SR 92). Turn south on San Martin Blvd. Travel approximately <br/>
one mile and then east on Weedon Drive NE. A canoe ramp, fishing pier <br/>
and public restroom is at the end of Weedon Drive. <br/>
<br/>
Access to Weedon Island is limited to less than 300 people at a time <br/>
and may controlled by a gate. Hours are 8am to 6pm daily. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Start at the Paul Getting Memorial Trail (boardwalk). There is a <br/>
parking lot here. Take the Tower Trail.  This boardwalk travels <br/>
through the marsh to an observation tower that reaches 45 feet above <br/>
sea level. Three levels of stairs take you to an observation deck <br/>
that provides a truly magnificent 360-degree view of the St. <br/>
Petersburg area. <br/>
Continue along until the boardwalk ends.  You'll see a sign <br/>
explaining the habitat of the Gopher Tortoise.  I saw several <br/>
Tortoises while hiding this box.  Please do not disturb them.  When <br/>
you reach the ruins that are surrounded by a white picket fence, you <br/>
are very close.<br/>
<br/>
An example of a kitchen midden can be found here. This mound was <br/>
originally over 10 feet high and 100 feet long. The midden was <br/>
leveled during the 1930's when the Grand Central Airport was built on <br/>
Weedon Island. The airport is no more, but part of the foundation for <br/>
the airport's office and waiting room still exists.  <br/>
