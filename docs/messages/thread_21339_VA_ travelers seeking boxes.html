As Civil War buffs you cannot miss the Balls Bluff Civil <br/>
War Trilogy <http: adg2.html#bluff="" wildwinds.tripod.com="">!<br/>
The small park is located in beautiful rural Loudoun County<br/>
and is not far from Fairfax and Manassas.  These boxes are<br/>
well worth the trip.<br/>
<br/>
The park <http: ballsbluff.html="" www.nvrpa.org=""> was the <br/>
site of a resounding Union defeat that resulted in <br/>
bodies washing down the Potomac past Washington, DC.<br/>
<http: ballsbluffbattle.html="" www.nvrpa.org=""><br/>
<br/>
You may have already seen this pamphlet, but just in case,<br/>
it has other Civil War suggestions:<br/>
<http: north="" pdftours="" smallbattles1-<br="" virginia="" www.civilwar-va.com="">
day.pdf&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you come to Leesburg I would also suggest the Goose Creek<br/>
Boxes <http: adg2.html#goose="" wildwinds.tripod.com=""> and A <br/>
Day in Leesburg Collection <br/>
<http: lbna="" letterboxes.html#leesburg="" members.cox.net="" rjalberth=""><br/>
<br/>
As to what to wear, I would suggest layers.  Except for a<br/>
couple snow storms we have had mostly mild weather - lots of<br/>
days in the 40s and 50s or even warmer. A t-shirt, <br/>
long-sleeved shirt, sweater, and jacket -- pile it all on if<br/>
it's freezing and wear less if it is warmer.  Or as frequently<br/>
happens, start the day wearing everything and then shed as it<br/>
warms up.  Round it out with gloves, scarf, hat, and boots <br/>
that can take you through the mud and you'll be set.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be happy to help, if I can, if you have any other<br/>
questions.<br/>

I'd love to hear a report back on the boxes you searched<br/>
and found.  I visited the Manassas National Battlefield<br/>
Park on during that time to take pictures of Stumpy from<br/>
the StumpyMonkey PBL. We got some strange looks as we <br/>
took pictures of a sock monkey along side the exhibits--<br/>
maybe they were just wishing they had a sock monkey!<br/>

Your information to us was very helpful and we had a great time searching for <br/>
boxes, even in the snow! We were able to get the following boxes:<br/>
<br/>
The Ball's Bluff Battlefield Civil War Trilogy (excellent!!)<br/>
Runway 17-35<br/>
A Flower for Mildred in Alexandria<br/>
Woodstock Wilderness     "<br/>
Blue Eagle (F'burg)<br/>
Hidden Pond Nature Center, Springfield (first 2--3rd's gone)<br/>
Stratford Hall Microbox              "<br/>
Bull Run in Manassas<br/>
The Babe Ruth Microbox in Baltimore<br/>
<br/>
Couldn't find the other 2 in the Park in Baltimore where Babe Ruth is (great <br/>
little stamp BTW!)<br/>
<br/>
Also, when we tried for the F'burg Train Station, we found the Merry <br/>
Christmas HH in the box--that's all! We figure a Newbie removed the wrong stamp and <br/>
log! Might check into that. . .<br/>
The F'Burg Battlefield box clue suggests the #2 box is gone but only has the <br/>
clues printed for the #2 box. It's definitely gone.<br/>
<br/>
So, how do you think we did?<br/>
