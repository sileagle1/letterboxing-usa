defaults sent it publically.  Whoops.  I know I'm not the only person <br/>

<br/>
I've tried to help with a little constructive criticism and provide <br/>
some good reasons not to hide hybrids, but if you feel you must, you <br/>
have every right to do so.  You will not make friends doing this.  <br/>
You won't get lots of pats on the back for the World's Most Fantastic <br/>
Letterbox.  But if you're more interested in hiding as many <br/>
letterboxes as possible without considering the quality of the box, <br/>
that's your own perogative.<br/>
<br/>
I've said what I had to say on the subject and beating a dead horse <br/>
won't accomplish anything more, so I'm done with this hybrid thread.<br/>
