We picked it up at the Inn 2/2. It's out there somewhere -- but a lot <br/>
of the boxes we've been visiting this winter haven't had many <br/>
visitors. Not all are as intrepid (insane?) as we. <br/>

                    <html><body>Well Aili and Bruce.... I've been behind you most of the winter!  It seems that you get to the same boxes as I, but a couple of days before!  I guess you could say that we're all crazy!  However, with the 20+ inches that we got over Feb break, I'm finding it VERY hard to find boxes!  I've been hitting the inside boxes lately (just planted a couple, with another going out perhaps this weekend).  I'm hoping that if I plant a few, then other letterboxers in New England won't be in so much withdrawal!  Now, if others could plant inside ones for me to find.......
