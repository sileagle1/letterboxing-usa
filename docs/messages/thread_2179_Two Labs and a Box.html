<div>Some of you will recognize this day and already know where the 
box resides. I do of course apologize for the length of time between placing the 
box and writing the clue. </div>

<div>Two Labs and a Box</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Difficulty: wasn't made to be easy</div>
<div>Time:could take a while</div>
<div>Distance: depends on how good you are at figuring out mystery 
boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    A long time ago a group of people went 
,on a blustery mid-winter day ,in search of treasures beyond imagination 
and to perhaps place one of their own. Their travels took them down muddy roads 
and winding paths and the wind chill provided them all with a sense of urgency. 
With two labrador retrievers in tow, or being towed by, the group set out under 
blue skies and high hopes. Upon reaching the Bluff, a Point was raised by one 
member of the group that a paw print from one of the dogs was certainly fitting 
in their stamp book, even though it wasn't expected. What else could you expect 
from an over-eager lab that's been locked away in a house all winter that has 
suddenly come to a beautiful view at Elaine and Jerry's rock? Whitecaps upon 
wind-tossed waves were the order of the day on the water that day. But, it was 
okay. The letterboxers ignored the wind. They had business to attend to. Upon 
exchanging everyone's stamps, the group continued on road in the direction from 
Elaine and Jerry's rock to the actual E&amp;J Bluff letterbox itself. However, 
they all knew that this wasn't the end of their day. In fact, it had just begun. 
Of course, the labs were both eager as well. Simba and Odie were thoroughly 
enjoying each other's company and were both trusted to be let off leash. Every 
now and then, other canines would come into view and the doggy friendships 
grew. Spirits were high and the mood was 'boxious'. </div>
<div>     So, continuing in the direction of 
the governor's mansion with Mumford Cove on their right, the group wondered 
where indeed they would place their treasure. Searching and searching, finally 
one of them noticed the purple and orange Sunset while sitting on a Rock. 
Without much hesitation another member noticed that the outside right edge of a 
large slab nearby would be a great place to hide a treasure of their own! Dogs 
were barking, children were laughing, waves were crashing, life was good. A few 
boxes found and another placed. Now if I could just figure out how to write the 
clue!</div>
