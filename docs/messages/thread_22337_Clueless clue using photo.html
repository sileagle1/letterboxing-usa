The second box I found was of legerdenly fame.<br/>
The clue was the stamp - just an image, but<br/>
enough to find the box. Amazing. What a treat<br/>
that it was our second letterboxing find.<br/>

will be joining a roster of fine clues of this type. <br/>
I have found boxes using photo clues from coast <br/>
to coast and I have personally created a few of my <br/>
own. Speaking of picture clues, I think Pungent Bob's <br/>
$100 Bill clue deserves high ranking in this genre. <br/>
Go for it! Funhog<br/>

and would require scrolling side to side to get all of the clue.   <br/>
Very aggrivating.  I notified the webmasters of the situation and now I <br/>
no longer have access to insert a photo. (no little green camera <br/>
anymore)  Did anyone else run into this situation or do you sitll have <br/>
the little green camera?<br/>

the all photos approach on a letterbox last fall.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.stampinthebox.com/clues/ccautumn.asp<br/>
<br/>
I actually thought it would be a really easy find -- the trail is <br/>
Googleable, so finding it should not be too difficult and there is <br/>
only one place along the trail (total length about a mile), where <br/>
the photos fit.<br/>
<br/>
So far, only a handful of seachers and no finders -- had a couple of <br/>
people say they couldn't find the trailhead, a couple others said <br/>
they didn't even attempt it because the clues were pretty obscure -- <br/>
only a couple of folks who actually walked the trail and gave it a <br/>
shot.  I find more and more as time goes on that people are looking <br/>
for plain jane, give-me-exact-directions-to-the-box-and-make-it-<br/>
quick types of letterboxes.  While there are still a handful who <br/>
seek out the mysteries and the challenges, they seem to be few and <br/>
far between -- at least from my experience.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, I wish I would see more clues like this posted -- <br/>
more creativity, stories, obscure landmarks, triangulation, <br/>
mysteries, photos...  rather than step-by-step instructions on how <br/>
to get to the box.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I'll just keep planting them and maybe someday, somebody <br/>
will take the challenge...<br/>

&gt; Someone pointed out the Clueless! letterbox the other day and it <br/>
got me <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; While Ryan's letterbox wins the award for most self-referential <br/>
clues, <br/>
&gt; how about posting just a photo in LbNA as your clue? That would be <br/>
easy <br/>
&gt; for, say, the Empire State Building or Lincoln Memorial, but not <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; easy for most hiking trails, as they all look alike.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With the new photo feature, it opens up new possibilities. What do <br/>
you <br/>

I'm just the opposite.   I started out wanting those simple, straightforward <br/>
clues, but lately I've been getting fascinated by solving the tougher mystery <br/>
ones.   It's just SO exciting when I actually find one!<br/>
<br/>
Granted, I'm not up to the REALLY hard ones, but I'm thinking maybe I can <br/>
work my way up.<br/>

What happened to it? I had already added photos to one of my clues:<br/>

&gt; For a while LBNA had installed a feature where you could insert a <br/>

the <br/>
&gt; picture fit the page perfectly just ablove the clue.   On the last <br/>
&gt; three  I tried to insert, the picture came out much wider than the <br/>
page <br/>
&gt; and would require scrolling side to side to get all of the clue.   <br/>
&gt; Very aggrivating.  I notified the webmasters of the situation and <br/>
now I <br/>
&gt; no longer have access to insert a photo. (no little green camera <br/>
