                    <div class="plaintext-content">On Thurs. we visited Campbell Falls and retrieved Music Woman's <br/>
letterbox.  The stamp is awesome and imprints very well, due to the <br/>
thick backing. The box was totally exposed however, with contents <br/>
scattered nearby.  Plastic bags were intact and no harm was done. I e-<br/>
mailed Music Woman, but thought I'd mention it here also.  The falls <br/>
are a very short hike and provide a serene place to picnic.  Perhaps <br/>
next time.<br/>
  On Friday, we went to Bartholomew's Cobble in Ashley Falls to find <br/>
the Craggy Knoll letterbox.  The geography of this spot is totally <br/>
unlike any I have ever seen.  It has a mossy, ancient prehistoric <br/>
feel to it.  A red-tailed hawk was startled (and startled us) as we <br/>
walked by.  One trail leads to a hill overlooking the Housatonic <br/>
River and nearby mountain ranges.  It is a prime hawk migration <br/>
viewing spot. Can't wait to go back. The letterbox was damp inside <br/>
but nothing harmed, fortunately.  I rebagged contents and dried out <br/>
the box, then notified the owners.  The stamp is a delicate 2-sided <br/>
one featuring wildflowers.  Using the 2 markers provided,the imprint <br/>
is truly beautiful.<br/>
  No letterboxing for me today, just getting my back-to-school <br/>
shopping done.  Yes, teachers, too need some new fall outfits, pens, <br/>
pencils and notepads for school. Also did garden cleanup and just <br/>
plain enjoying the gorgeous weather today.<br/>
