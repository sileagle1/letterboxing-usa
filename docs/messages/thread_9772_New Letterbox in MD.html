<br/>Hillmead Park, Bethesda, MD, Montgomery County 
<br/>placed by D and Shoo, December 21, 2002
<br/>Difficulty: very easy; a "drive-by" letterbox suitable for a winter day when it's too cold to hike
<br/>
<br/>Placed on the Winter Solstice to help us "Think Spring!"
<br/>
<br/>Directions: From the Capital Beltway (Interstate 495), take River Road (Exit 39) east.  Turn left on Beech Tree Road.  Beech Tree Road becomes Burning Tree Road.  Stay on Burning Tree Road to Bradley Boulevard.  Turn right on Bradley Boulevard and continue .8 mile to Valley Road.  Turn left on Valley Road. (From the other direction, take Bradley Boulevard .4 mile north of Huntington Parkway to Valley Road.  Turn right on Valley Road.)  At the next corner, turn right onto Ridge Road.  The park is on your right.
<br/>
<br/>Take the paved path past the playground to the tennis court.  Walk a little further along, with the tennis court on your left, until you are even with the net.  To your right you will see a large tree.  Behind the tree is what you seek —  a bouquet of flowers to remind you of spring!     
<br/>
<br/>We suggest you bring some paper towels to wipe off your hands after stamping in; we got a little carried away carving on several surfaces of our stamps!

<br/>
<br/>Jkid's Letterbox
<br/>
<br/>Clara Barton National Historic Site
<br/>Bethesda Maryland
<br/>Montgomery County. 
<br/>
<br/>Planted by Jkid, Cheese, Monkey, Comet, and Toasty 
<br/>Difficulty:  easy---a drive-by
<br/>Planted 1/12/03
<br/>
<br/>Take McArthur Blvd. toward Washington D.C. Turn right at Glen Echo/Clara Barton national historic site.  Park at the 1st (small) parking lot. Stand and face the handicapped parking space. Take 33 steps toward the left until you get to the walkway with the sign that says 5801. Follow the walkway until you see a right turn in the walk way. Take the right turn to the gravel walk way. Turn left and follow it around until you get to the far right corner of the Clara Barton Historical Site house. Take twenty steps forward and look right  until you see a small garden and three stones piled on top of each other…under the three stones is what you seek.<br/></body></html>
