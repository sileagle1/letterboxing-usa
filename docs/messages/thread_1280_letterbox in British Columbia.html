<br/>
I have put a letterbox out in British Columbia (yesterday), in Pacific <br/>
Spirit Regional Park (also known as the Endowment Lands, part of the <br/>
University of British Columbia, Vancouver).<br/>
<br/>
In Pacific Spirit Regional Park, start at the south end of the Sword Fern <br/>
trail.  The trail head is west of the SW Marine Drive and 41st Ave. <br/>
intersection, on Marine Drive.  You can park at a historical marker on the <br/>
south side of Marine Drive.  Right across Marine Drive from the marker is <br/>
the trail head.  [On the south end of the trail, there is an Ecological <br/>
Reserve immediately east of the trail.  Please don't enter it.]  Proceed <br/>
north until you pass over the Council trail.  At this point, there are <br/>
short (~6 or 7 feet tall) trees &amp; bushes close by on both sides of the <br/>
trail.  The trail will open up (this is still soon after crossing over <br/>
Council) and you'll immediately see a 6 foot tall stump off the eastern <br/>
side of the trail.  Beyond the stump is a large, long, downed tree, whose <br/>
diameter looks to be 4.5 or 5 feet (perhaps it used to be connected to the <br/>
stump :).  Walk around to the other side of the downed tree, and look for a <br/>
"cave" formed by the roots of another (upright) tree growing against the <br/>
downed tree.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
