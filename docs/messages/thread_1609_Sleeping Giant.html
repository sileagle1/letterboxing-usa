    I didn't make the Sleeping Giant Letterboxes, but I did look for them.<br/>
I found all of them except for the tower box, too.  I think that it is<br/>
missing because I went to the spot where I thought it should be and found a<br/>
little pile of rocks like letterboxes are sometimes hidden under.  I have<br/>
heard lots of other people say that they couldn't find it either.   Good<br/>
luck!<br/>

<br/>
To let you know that today my friend and I did the Fond Farewell<br/>
series --andI do hope he is not going to follow through on that message<br/>
because who would I go letterboxing with then ;) -- anyway this series was<br/>
thoroughly enjoyed by each of us and the snow made it particularly beautiful<br/>
with Newport beaches in the distance with beautiful glistening sunshine<br/>
sparkling on the water --- however I have some sad news the letterbox on the<br/>
middle ridge has been saturated with water, now ice, and is missing the<br/>
stamp and the hanging rock letterbox is completely missing --<br/>
<br/>
ps my friend is lonemasswolf --- and we are looking forward to more distinct<br/>
challenges from the Drew Clan -- like what about the ridges in the White<br/>
Mountains ?  Are you up for that ?<br/>
<br/>
see ya<br/>

    ok, we'll wait till January to go find it and then we'll finally finish<br/>
the whole Sleeping Giant series. I can't wait. I don't know who wrote the<br/>
Really Bad Hemingway. Was it you? well we figured it out and yesterday, on<br/>
Saturday we went to find it and we did, but the box was practically frozen.<br/>
hahahahaha! well bye.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We live nearby Sleeping Giant, and since we usually go with a <br/>
4-year-old, we've broken down the series into individual hikes. I've <br/>
marked the SG trail map and routed hikes on trails I don't think I've <br/>
been on before...which also means parking somewhere other than the <br/>
main entrance. It's a beautiful park and would be a nice place to <br/>
have a letterboxers' gathering.<br/>
