<br/>
Wild Child and I were in Ohio a couple of weeks back and replaced the missing <br/>
Acorn box @ Adell Durbin in Stow.   Wow--we were amazed by how many people <br/>
had stamped into Squirrely's box--and how many said it was their first box.   We <br/>
had no idea that there would be that many boxers in the area/passing thru.   <br/>
<br/>
If you go after Acorn in the near future, take bug spray with you--the <br/>
skeeters were out in force.<br/>
<br/>

P.S. Sorry that we left a bit too soon to nab the new series in Kent!   We'll <br/>
be looking forward to it next summer during our annual visit to Stow!<br/>
