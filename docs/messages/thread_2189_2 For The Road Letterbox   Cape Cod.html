<br/>
Location: Begin at Orleans , Cape Cod , Ma. County ?<br/>
<br/>
It was a April School vacation and we need to get out and see some <br/>
spring. So we pack little bags, strap bikes to the back of the car, <br/>
get our bathing suits and towels and of course our letterboxing back <br/>
packs.  We're off!  We rode some National Seashore trails, we walked <br/>
on the beach in a fine gray mist. We visited 3 singing sisters. We <br/>
needed to get a place to stay. <br/>
     At the Orleans  rotary ( don't you love Cape Cod's Rotaries ) We <br/>
turned off onto Canal Rd to stay at the Seashore Park Inn. This is <br/>
right behind Friendly's - very convenient. You will want to begin <br/>
here or at the Orleans Bike Shop a little further up the trail on <br/>
Main St.  We rode Canal Rd. to Locust , and turned left onto a woodsy <br/>
trail unpaved but smooth pedaling along the rear of some condos.We <br/>
came out at Orleans Cycle ,they have a very nice free copy of the <br/>
bike trail map here and were most helpful. We walked across Main st. <br/>
in the blue painted cross walk. A train platform for Orleans station <br/>
has been converted to a picnic stop. This is the famous Cape Cod Rail <br/>
Trail it's great. The trail is paved, wide and clear we are off on <br/>
our adventure. After a bit we come to a T we turn right on a road to <br/>
go up over a bridge that spans over Rte 6 there is wide margins so <br/>
it's pretty safe. We turn left on Salty Ridge Rd. All well marked for <br/>
bikers.  Salty turns Rt and you can see it run into the trail at its <br/>
end. We pass the pipes that keep vehicles off and proceed along just <br/>
where the trains used to run. The scenery is very Cape Cod. Scrub <br/>
pines , marshes, shingled houses, and friendly people . Bonjour to <br/>
the French speaking bike team that passed us all smiles and <br/>
greetings.   We pass some greenhouses to the left.  Soon stop to <br/>
cross Oceanview and Old Bog Rd. carefully.  Our next crossing is a <br/>
private deadend Rd. We see no one here.  " Oh look ahead a tunnel" It <br/>
echos inside and we hoot and whistle  to  hear ourselves again. <br/>
   Soon we pedal into Nickerson State Park. It has many side trails <br/>
we saved for another visit. They have bike rental , camping and rest <br/>
room fascilities in season.  On we go crossing a dirt rd. next.  We <br/>
ride more as the terrain is mostly flat and the pedaling easy. We <br/>
cross another road.  As we pedal we spot a bright purple house on the <br/>
right it looks like an Easter house in it's spring color. We go on a <br/>
bit more spotting our second tunnel up ahead. We pedal through and <br/>
stop! On the left behind the tree we left a memory of our wonderful <br/>
bike trip on Cape Cod. Hope you have as much fun as we did.  At this <br/>
point we turned back making the hour trip back to our hotel and the <br/>
Hot tub and pool. The trail continues and you could consult maps for <br/>
a bigger adventure.  Happy Rail Trails .  <br/>
