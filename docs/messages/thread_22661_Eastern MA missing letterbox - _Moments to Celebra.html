Once upon a time I found this "Moments to Celebrate Box" where it <br/>
should have been near the habitat of a river creature. Hence water, <br/>
hence mosquito. If you plan to be outside in any wet woodland <br/>
habitats in New England you'll find mosquitoes. Because one or two <br/>
or even ten people could not find the box and one person deems <br/>
it "an extreme high risk area" does not mean the clues should be <br/>
removed for this box. It's a beautiful place to be visited, and if <br/>
those clues give people a reason to go, all the better for it. And <br/>
*gasp* if they walk away without an increase in their F count, I <br/>
think the experience will be worth it still.<br/>

Patience is needed.  There could be a very long list of reasons why you<br/>
haven't received a response yet ... almost 2 weeks is not a very long<br/>

Four different letterobxers have searched this area for this box - it is not there.  We found the "curious formation of roots" (similar description), and searched for similar root masses within a large distance.  I have many years of Orienteering Experience - this box is not there.  The owner does not respond to email - this box is abandoned and should be removed from the listing.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - I forgot to mention, the area is infested with mosquitoes and is in a high risk area for EEE (fatal).  I would not be so blunt if I thought there was the slightest chance of the placer finding this message - but I have never seen a worse placement.  (It no doubt looked fine [&amp; the roots are really cool], when the box was placed years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
This listing needs to be removed.<br/>

ok - agreed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I perhaps should have worded it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Letterboxers who want to place letterboxes in areas that flood frequently should really think twice before selecting that area."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are actually right - of course.<br/>

Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to do a good deed.  I certainly was not expecting to get flak about it.  As for the EEE - you are right of course - but why allow people to be misled &amp; possibly be at risk - when the box appears missing anyway.  As I pointed out in today's response - I did a lot to make SURE - I had not missed the box (as did Tiny Turtle - another experienced Orienteeer).   In the future, should I contact you directly??  Bob<br/>
<br/>
As for EEE, I am no longer seeing any mosquitoes (there may still be some "off-trail").<br/>
