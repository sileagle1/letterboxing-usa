&gt; Riverfront Park Series	<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Riverfront Park<br/>
&gt; Laurel, Maryland<br/>
&gt; April 13 2003<br/>
&gt; Place by: Chessie Lover<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From I-95 take the Rt. 216 exit towards Laurel. At the second <br/>
&gt; traffic light turn right on to Main Street. Go all the way to the <br/>
&gt; end, park at the Riverfront Park parking lot. <br/>
&gt; During the summer months you may want to bring a swimsuit and a <br/>
&gt; couple of bucks and go swimming at the Laurel Municipal Pool next <br/>
&gt; door.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Easter Bunny Trail<br/>
&gt; Clue difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt; Hike difficulty: Easy, approx. 2 mile<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This trail starts just behind the fence to the pool. On the other <br/>
&gt; side of the pool you will see a guard rail to the left. This is <br/>
&gt; where the Laurel Suspension bridge stood before it was washed away <br/>
&gt; by the flood caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972. It was an award <br/>
&gt; winning bridge and there is still talk of rebuilding it.  From here <br/>
&gt; you will also see the destruction caused by the tornado that ripped <br/>
&gt; through here in the fall of 2001. Weather seems to like this spot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box 1<br/>
&gt; The Easter Bunny<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The first bench to the right has a half fallen tree behind it. In <br/>
&gt; the stump that's still standing you find your first box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box 2<br/>
&gt; The Easter Basket<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Continue along the trail, as it passes underneath the Rt. 216 <br/>
&gt; overpass. Just pass the bridge is a bench on the left. Directly <br/>
&gt; across from it are two trees. Behind the second tree under some <br/>
&gt; brush, you'll find box 2. The building you see up the hill house's <br/>
&gt; the Red Hot and Blue Restaurant. If they are cooking up some ribs, <br/>
&gt; your stomach may start growling, you may want to hike back along <br/>
&gt; Main Street, which parallels the trail, at the end of the trail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box 3<br/>
&gt; The Easter Egg<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep on the trail. It will come to a clearing. On the left next to <br/>
&gt; the rivers edge is a bench; to the right is an old stump. In the <br/>
&gt; tree's base is box 3.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box 4<br/>
&gt; The Marshmallow Peeps<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Continue along the trail. Pass the playground; pass the parking lot, <br/>
&gt; over the bridge. Do not cross the next bridge but continue strait, <br/>
&gt; the paved trail will end and become a gravel path. At the base of <br/>
&gt; the large tree to your right is box 4. What would Easter be like <br/>
&gt; without those Peeps!<br/>
&gt; Now head back either by the trail or walk up to Main Street by <br/>
&gt; taking the bridge you were told not to cross and turn right at Main <br/>
&gt; Street and walk till it ends at the Riverfront parking lot. <br/>
