by boxes and dislike searching for a missing box.  What is a drive by<br/>
box for you can take my three year old and me (with an infant on my<br/>
back) over an hour to reach.  This is time for me to spend with my<br/>
sons, and I'd rather not have it end in tears because he can't find<br/>
the box.  He doesn't understand missing.  It's not the F count for him<br/>
-- he really can't count much past 10 -- but finding something someone<br/>
else hid for him to find.  Believe me, he enjoys the journey.  He<br/>
might not care about your waterfall or scenic vista, but we have an<br/>
acorn and rock collection that is his pride and joy.  Maybe someday<br/>
when no one in my family needs to be carried or tires after a mile or<br/>
so, I'll feel differently, but for now, drive by boxes and the find<br/>
history are what makes letterboxing possible for us.<br/>

&gt; While I won't presume to answer for Jay, I certainly realize a few<br/>
&gt; problems with these two functions. If you would look at it from<br/>
&gt; a "Placers" perspective these two functions do not add anything<br/>
&gt; positive to the placer's letterbox. On the contrary they tend to<br/>
&gt; detract from the creation. Mystery is diminished if not eliminated.<br/>
&gt; Finders may not even try for a letterbox if there is many "attempts"<br/>
&gt; listed, and if the box hasn't been "found" in sometime the<br/>
&gt; prevailing wisdom might be that it is missing. The only thing that<br/>
&gt; really is effected is the search or lack of a search for<br/>
&gt; the "Finders".<br/>
&gt; There is a different mindset for the planter of a letterbox as<br/>
&gt; compared to the finder. The planter has created this stamp, logbook,<br/>
&gt; found a really neat spot that they want to share, taken the time to<br/>
&gt; plant the box, write clues (sometimes very cleverly) and then post<br/>
&gt; those clues.<br/>
&gt; The finder (not all) on the other hand wants to increase their F<br/>
&gt; count, checks to see if there is a history and when it was found<br/>
&gt; last. If it is a driveby and near another boxes so much the better.<br/>
&gt; Drives to the starting point, doesn't read the clues properly or<br/>
&gt; maybe not completely, looks for the box and if successful, stamps in<br/>
&gt; hurriedly and rushes off to the next letterbox. Doesn't even bother<br/>
&gt; to hike 50 more feet up the trail to the cool little waterfall that<br/>
&gt; was the reason in the first place for the letterbox. In their mind<br/>
&gt; that is okay because they think they had a successful weekend in<br/>
&gt; nabbing 30 letterboxes.<br/>
&gt;  Now many of us have done that very thing and many have come to a<br/>
&gt; point that those  multi-box weekends are less important. When it<br/>
&gt; comes right down to it I don't really give a damn about an F count,<br/>
&gt; what I care about is giving a gift of a neat spot, different<br/>
&gt; experience, a passable hand carved stamp, and some time you can<br/>
&gt; share with your family, friends or special person.<br/>
&gt; Some folks have a problem with boxes they deem "missing" or they<br/>
&gt; can't find easily. Not finding every letterbox is a part of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing. Sometimes life isn't always finding every last Easter<br/>
&gt; egg. Next time maybe you should think quality not quantity and not<br/>
&gt; even bother to check a letterbox history  and instead of cramming<br/>
&gt; several searches into you weekend go out for a single letterbox and<br/>
&gt; enjoy all of that "one" experience.<br/>
