over our heads don't realize how widespread this is.  We (and before <br/>
"we", I) have often -- very often -- come accross people's homes in <br/>
the woods.  We give them wide enough berth to respect the person's <br/>
privacy.<br/>
<br/>
A huge percentage of homeless people are mentally ill. That doesn't <br/>
mean they're dangerous, it means they aren't acceptably functional in <br/>
our society. Calling the police and making them aware that a person is <br/>
out there behaving oddly *may* give that person a chance at getting <br/>
some help, temporary treatment, &amp;/or a meal and clean bed for a night.<br/>
<br/>
We have the DEP tipline "turn in poachers" 1-800-842-HELP on our <br/>
speed-dial. :)<br/>
