                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hate to disagree with you Randy, but I think most people feel very <br/>
strong ownership of their placed boxes.  I know I do.  If fact, I think <br/>
we SHOULD feel ownership, otherwise we would lose the desire to <br/>
maintain our boxes and they would all become orphans.<br/>
<br/>
I guess one advantage to your thinking is that next time the NPS <br/>
complains to you about a box in their park, you can honestly say it <br/>
belongs to nobody :)<br/>

&gt; I think once you place something in the wild, it is no longer yours.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; JMHO, of course.<br/>
