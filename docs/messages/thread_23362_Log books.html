As for the log books in boxs, it varies from cash register tape bound <br/>

The best books go to the places where they are less likely to go <br/>

<br/>
Register tape logs are for the little round containers or for the 6 oz <br/>
Lock and Lock boxes.  The are made by turning the tape around a 1 foot <br/>
ruler for 10 to 12 times.  Flatten the tape at both ends, remove ruler <br/>
and then fold that in half.  Staple in the middle of the last fold so <br/>
that the 10 pages become 20 when finished and cut off the ends with a <br/>
paper cutter.<br/>

What ever you make, remember it will probably suffer some sort of <br/>
moisture dammage.  Big logs get laminated covers with hand tinted stamp <br/>
impressions.<br/>
<br/>
There is no real set design, it's what you make of it that counts.<br/>
