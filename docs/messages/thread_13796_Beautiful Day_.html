We only found one - Kirby in the Clouds at Borderland in Easton, MA - but we still had a lot of fun! We were going to try for the Fairies series but ran out of time as we ran into some friends and spent the day playing with them! :) <br/>
<br/>
The Kirby in the Clouds stamp is really neat! The boys loved it! <br/>
