<tt>I have relinked (is that a word?) my clues for Mugu Peak and Superstition
mtn 1. The others will follow. After thinking about it further I am more
convinced that given the distance that some people travel to go boxing,
adding time info is not a bad idea.  Forester obviously expected a
drive-by box and got something else. However, I am still wondering who
had the gun against his head when he decided to push on after it was clear
that he couldn't get back out.  It seems clear that some people expect
a drive by box by default.  The two fellows who were going to do both
the Weiss and Ringwood boxes (along with a couple of others) in one day
may not have planned it that way if they knew that there was 10-12 miles
of hiking involved for my two boxes alone. I view it as a courtesy issue.  </tt><tt></tt>
<p><tt>If someone is setting up a page to discuss safety issues, I have
a link to a web site on Desert Survival.  I was seriously dehydrated
once (believe me you don't want to go there) so it absolutely stuns me
to see people hiking along without any water.</tt>
<br/><tt></tt> <tt></tt>
</p><p><tt>In a separate issue, The Race is on to bag the last two states. 
Lonely North Dakota (the least visited state in the union) and South Dakota. 
Be forewarned that I plan on seeding boxes in those two states in July. 
You have a month to get there before me!</tt><tt></tt>

  will have wandered over a considerable percentage of those states' areas to 
  find them...:) The visiters may be rare, but you will make sure that their
