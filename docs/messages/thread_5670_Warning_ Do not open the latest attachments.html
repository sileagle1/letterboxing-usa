<br/>
Almost every attachment that's appeared on this list over the past <br/>
few days IS infected--and they're still coming (one since my last <br/>
post alone). **Don't** download/open the attachments.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Play it safe! On this list (or *any* list):<br/>
<br/>
1. Be suspicious of messages that (a) don't have directly to do with <br/>
letterboxing and (b) have attachments to them.<br/>
2. If there is no text to a message, just an attachment, or it has <br/>
text that is vaguely worded, and you still wish to download the <br/>
attachment, be ***sure*** your virus software is up to update and set <br/>
on real-time status, so that it will catch an infected download <br/>
before it has a chance to damage your computer.<br/>
<br/>
Knowledge is power. We *can* do something about people who get their <br/>
kicks out of hurting others in this way. Pass the knowledge on!!<br/>
