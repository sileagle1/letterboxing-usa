Nearby this spot was evidence of several outdoor parties (beer cans, <br/>

someone found the box and plundered it. Having been planted in the <br/>

post these to my personal letterboxing web site. Also, I stopped in <br/>

couple of hours searching for the elusive "perfect spot" for a <br/>
special letterbox I intend to plant. Again, I had a great hike, but <br/>
didn't see any spots that I liked for my letterbox. There's always <br/>

I just didn't count the paces correctly so I just counted it as a failed<br/>

<br/>
Regarding paces, I should say that even though I didn't find the <br/>
letterbox, I still gained some experience in the game.  Der Mad <br/>
Stamper used a couple of easily identifiable landmarks.  Using the <br/>
paces he wrote in his clues, I found that his "pace" and my "pace" <br/>
were quite different.  I counted 200 where he had 250 right off the <br/>
bat!  <br/>
<br/>
His choosing of a few relatively easy to find landmarks gave me a <br/>
chance to "calibrate" my paces to his before he went on to the harder <br/>
clues (ie: one where there was no exact landmark: just to stop after <br/>
X number of paces and change direction).<br/>
<br/>
Please do list the Kansas boxes you found.  I may be able to seek <br/>
those some day down the line.<br/>

    We had an ambitious day in Oct. planned and our first attempt at Waconda<br/>
Lake was not successful but I think it was my fault for not interpreting the<br/>
clues just right.  But the next five were great and quite easy, taking you<br/>
to lovely parks and byways that I hadn't even known about even though I had<br/>
lived in Kansas and went to school there:  Wheathead, Home on the Range,<br/>
Kirwin Lake (box there but no stamp), Webster Lake (contents wet but still<br/>
usable), and Prairie Dog State Park.  Have fun.  It sure helped my total of<br/>
12 (it's a sorry showing compared to those of you with totals of three<br/>
figures but then there is only one box in Iowa and we need to travel MILES<br/>
to the sources).  Have a winning good trip but, most of all, have a great<br/>
time.  Nancy<br/>
