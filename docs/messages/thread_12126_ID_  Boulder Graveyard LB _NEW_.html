Boulder Graveyard<br/>
Nearest town: Kuna, Idaho<br/>
Ada County<br/>
Placed by A-Bear on 19 April 2003<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From I84 take exit 44 south on route 69<br/>
for about 8 miles.  Turn left onto Swan Falls Road and<br/>
follow that road for about 21 miles.   At the bottom<br/>
of the hill turn right.  When you come to a gravel<br/>
road the letterbox will be about 2 miles ahead.  So<br/>
you can either park at the dam and walk to it or drive<br/>
on the road that is not maintained, but still OK.  You<br/>
will drive between the Snake River on your left and<br/>
the rock slides on your right.  When you come to the<br/>
sign stating there are only 2.5 miles remaining of<br/>
road, continue a few yards ahead to the one parking<br/>
spot on the right next to two large rocks. <br/>
<br/>
Level of Difficulty:  Easy drive-by or 4 mile flat<br/>
hike if you choose to walk to it.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
As you travel north along the gravel road from the<br/>
dam, you eventually spy the boulder graveyard up<br/>
ahead.  A few yards past the 2.5 miles of road<br/>
remaining there are two large rocks on the right next<br/>
to a place to park.  At the bottom of the rock on the<br/>
lift is a U.S. Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey Bench Marker.<br/>
Walk between the two rocks to the cracked boulder<br/>
resting at 40 degrees.  Traverse around its right side<br/>
to spot the cracked larger boulder to its rear. <br/>
Theres a deep crevice below its northwestern end<br/>
shielding the Boulder Graveyard letterbox with a flat<br/>
rock.<br/>
<br/>
On your way there or back find the Swan Falls Dam<br/>
Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Please read the waiver of responsibility and watch out<br/>
for snakes (not that I saw any, but all the rocks seem<br/>
like a snakes haven).<br/>
