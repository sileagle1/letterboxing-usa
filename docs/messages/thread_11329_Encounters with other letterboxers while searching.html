I definitely second that! Are you listening SALAMANDER?! LOL<br/>
<br/>
If Franzsolo had not said hi to Team Min Dawg &amp; I, we wouldn't have had the<br/>
opportunity for all that great boxing we've been doing.<br/>
<br/>
Go for it!<br/>

I would say most letterboxers are friendly and don't bite so its<br/>
O.K. to approach them.... just don't feed them! <grin>  All kidding<br/>
aside, and as a new letterboxer I would definately say hi.  You'll<br/>
probably put a name with the face and get a stamp in exchange.  I<br/>
think if i came away with one thing from Patrick and Amy bringing us<br/>
to the CT Kids day last October, its the fact that pretty much<br/>
everyone is extremely friendly and equally excited to meet people on<br/>
the trail!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else share this sentiment???<br/>

&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt; I would like some advice about what to do if you meet others while<br/>
&gt; out searching for clues. I think this happened to me this winter.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was concentrating on my compass readings, looked up and saw 2<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; mere yards ahead of me.  I quietly left.  The references to<br/>
stamping<br/>
&gt; in seem to indicate it is o.k. make contact. As a fairly new<br/>
&gt; letterboxer living in the letterbox-rich area of Mansfield, I am<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; likely to run across other folks. In fact, while out hiking,<br/>
carrying<br/>
&gt; my letterboxing gear, I am always on the lookout for fellow hikers<br/>
&gt; with  ink stained fingers and crumpled maps. How do others deal<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; chance encounters?<br/>
