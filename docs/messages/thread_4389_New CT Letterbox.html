<p align="center">Woodelves Letterbox</p>
<p align="center">(Hampton, CT)</p>
<p>Placed February 3. 2002</p>
<p>Rated: Easy to Moderate (some uphill)</p>
<p>Planted by jurneez and Vinnie the Dog.</p>
<p>Vinnie left a treat for your dog if you bring him letterboxing.</p>
<p>Travel north 4 mi. on Rt. 97 from Rt. 6 in Hampton. (about 3 mi. north from 
Hampton Center). Directly across from Kimball Hill Rd., which is on the right, 
marks the entrance to H.E. Preston Nature Sanctuary on the left. There are some 
small signs on the trees on the right hand side on entrance. Parking is along 
Rt. 97 and is on grassy shoulder. Enough room for several cars.This piece of 
land is a Joshua’s Trust acquisition.</p>
<p>As legends are told, Woodelves live in a quiet part of the forest with water 
near by. Hampton Woodelves live not quite at high elevation and yet never at 
river elevation either. As with most Woodelves, they sprinkle the stars around 
at dusk for dreams to be had and collect them at dawn for another night. Thus 
the magic hours for Woodelves is Dusk &amp; Dawn and their magic color is 
Yellow. jurneez woodelves maintain a little shelter off the trodden path 
blending well with nature.</p>
<p>To start, walk down the 300 foot dirt road from Rt. 97 to a large field. Go 
to the right far corner and you’ll see where the trail once was, now clearly 
marked as private property. Turn left and continue along the back line of the 
field. Heading south. A little ways down you’ll find a huge yellow blaze sign 
about 1  feet long by 5 inches wide, (says nothing) on a tree and a yellow 
blaze painted on a rock. Go through the stone wall here. Follow path, it turns 
to right and left, winds around through woods. Goes through a second stone wall 
as it turns left. As path takes a sharp turn to left, look for a big tree on 
left, then a downed tree on right, continue on. </p>
<p>At third stone wall following yellow dot trail turn right and go down hill. 
At river turn left with river on your right, continue on trail. Enjoy the river. 
It’s name is “Little River”. Then head uphill away from river. Look for the 
Woodelves retreat which is a 2 foot wide, 20 foot fallen tree on the left. About 
20 feet up off the path. Woodelves like to bury their treasures in the East end 
of places. You'll find their treasure there! Follow the trail back up to field 
and then cross field, slightly turning left to the starting 300 foot dirt road 
which you won't be able to see until you're over the hill. </p>
<p>The Woodelves always suggest you take a treat for your dog if you’re 
traveling with one.</p>

                    <html><body><p>Hi. I posted clues to a new letterbox last Saturday, and the letterboxing.org list has been updated since then, but this letterbox hasn't been added. I think it might be because I forgot to put "new letterbox" as my subject. I'm reposting the directions. I think that's what I'm supposed to do ... the following is a copy of what I posted last saturday:<br/></p>
<p>I've never written clues for a letterbox before, so please excuse me if I do something wrong. Here goes.</p>
<p>These letterboxes were planted by three teams of children attending the Camp Exploration summer camp at Windham Center school in Windham, CT. (Windham county). The directions are as follows:</p>
<p><br/>The Huskies letterbox:</p>
<p>Go to Windham center school. It's located along Rt. 14 in Windham, CT. Park on the east side of the school. Walk past the swings and seesaws, and around the portables to the back. Go past a cement block, and follow the path behind the backstop. Continue until you reach a small clearing with 4 paths. Take the left path. Walk 39 small steps. The box is hidden on your left, where three trees grow out of one trunk.</p>
<p>The Wildcat letterbox:</p>
<p>To reach the Wildcat letterbox, continue along the path you left to find the Huskies letterbox. Keep going until you see a small pond. (At some points in the year, this pool will be dried up.) Go right around the pool until you see a stone wall. The box is hidden under the fifth rock from the left on the bottom.</p>
<p>The DJ JAAKS letterbox:</p>
<p>Now go back to the clearing. With your back to the trail you found the two letterboxes on, turn left, and take the trail. Your treasure will be on your right, 40 small steps down the trail, in an abandoned animal home a little ways off the trail.</p>
<p>Good luck!! :)</p>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone!  Today we posted our first letterbox- it's a VERY easy <br/>
find- no hike involved.  All told you should be in &amp; out within 10 <br/>
minutes max.  Hope you enjoy it.  I'll submit the clues to the <br/>
database but put it here as well.  <br/>
<br/>
The Pine Point Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
In honor of Maya's first year of school...<br/>
<br/>
To get to Pine Point, take I-95 to exit 91.  Turn East at the end of <br/>
the ramp.  Continue 3/10 of a mile &amp; turn left onto North Main <br/>
Street.  Take the first left onto Barnes Road.  The school is <br/>
approximately 1/2 mile on the right.  <br/>
<br/>
When you turn into the parking lot, turn left to park in the spaces <br/>
in front of the building.  <br/>
<br/>
To begin your search for the box, start at the Pine Point Sign next <br/>
to the building. Stand in front of the sign, facing the street, &amp; <br/>
find the stone seat at 320 degrees.    From the seat, walk 15 paces <br/>
to the west which will put you slightly to the left of the triple <br/>
trunk tree.  The treasure is hidden near the base of the stone wall <br/>
underneath some easily movable rocks.  <br/>
<br/>
Please be sure that you rehide the box carefully as this is a school <br/>
with lots of kids lurking about.  Also, since it is a school please <br/>
do not try to fetch the stamp Mon-Fri between 7-5.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you &amp; enjoy!<br/>
-The Family!<br/>
