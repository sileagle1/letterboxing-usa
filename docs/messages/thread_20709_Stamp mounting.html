I just use Eileen's Tacky Glue -- thicker than Elmer's white.<br/>

wooden block with the stamp prior to mounting. <br/>

We've been away for a long weekend so I'm just catching up on everything.<br/>
<br/>
I use thick fun foam (foamies) instead of wood because wood always<br/>
seems to warp in our climate, and getting a good print from the stamp<br/>
is hard.  The foam is 1/4" thick shaped like "Do Not Disturb" signs to<br/>
hang on the door knob, found in crafts stores.  This is what they look<br/>
like, scroll down to the first image on the left  <br/>
http://www.stainedglassoriginals.com/kidscraftsupplies_kits.html<br/>
<br/>
Some crafts stores sell sheets about 9" x 11" x 6mm thick.<br/>
<br/>
Foam is quite inexpensive and can be cut with scissors and written on<br/>
with a sharpie pen.<br/>
<br/>
If you can't find any where you are, email me offline.<br/>

I use "Elmer's Craft Bond Ultra Sticks All (Blue tube, purple label)".<br/>
 You might need to do a little test pinch on the tube to be sure it<br/>
isn't hard &amp; dried out before you leave the store, a problem I've been<br/>
running into lately.  Another glue is 5 minute epoxy, the more<br/>
expensive brand.  I haven't tried this though.  <br/>
<br/>
Before gluing I rough up both sides so the glue has something to grab<br/>
onto.  I always put down more than I need leaving a rim of glue around<br/>
the edge of the stamp, because sometimes the glue will pull back<br/>
underneath the stamp leaving open areas between the backing and stamp.<br/>
 The rim of glue seems to prevent it.  <br/>
<br/>
Whatever you do DO NOT USE GOOP WITH FOAM or the thing will warp.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
