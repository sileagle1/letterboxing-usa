season to people who have been injured in the line of pursuing the <br/>
sport they love.<br/>
<br/>
I got two in one season.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest we need a Purple Stamp Award to folks injured in the line <br/>
of Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Chuck glad to hear you are not undaunted.  Of course after reading <br/>
your story I instantly thought of a design for the stamp to the <br/>
commemorative LB that must be placed.<br/>
<br/>
Keep moving and loose.<br/>
