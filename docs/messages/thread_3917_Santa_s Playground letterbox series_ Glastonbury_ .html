J.B. Williams Park<br/>
Glastonbury, CT<br/>
placed December 10, 2001<br/>
by the Varrell family<br/>
<br/>
Easy, one hour round trip<br/>
<br/>
Directions: Route 2E, exit 9.  Left onto Neipsic Road.  J.B. Williams<br/>
Park is 0.6 miles on left.<br/>
<br/>
Santa and his friends like to romp at J.B. Williams Park when they need a<br/>
break from the stress of planning Christmas surprises for children around<br/>
the world.  Santa always stops at the rock to read the plaque about J.B.<br/>
Williams and remember the fine soap and toiletries his factory produced. <br/>
Santa remembers what good gifts these were in the late 1800s.<br/>
<br/>
Santa passes around the pole gate to begin his rest and relaxation.  He<br/>
recites the months of the year, one with every step of his left foot,<br/>
then turns left (30 degrees) to follow the road less traveled, since he's<br/>
not generally a man to take common travel routes.  He enjoys walking on<br/>
the pine needle softness for his tired feet, having long since worn out<br/>
the insoles in his black boots.  He soon comes to a fork and bears right.<br/>
 He follows this trail as it bends to the right at an old granite<br/>
hitching post, no longer used because the reindeer play freely here. <br/>
Soon he comes to a subtle fork and bears left, then right to join the<br/>
main path as it heads deeper into the quiet of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
He travels up the gradual incline to the top of the hill, where he takes<br/>
a rest on the bench.  Ol' Santa needs a breather; all those cookies and<br/>
mugs of cocoa haven't exactly done his physique a lot of good.  He looks<br/>
around the clearing to see if there are any reindeer games going on there<br/>
today, and wanders to the fire circle at 250 degrees.  Just beyond this<br/>
is a reindeer path with a rooty start, leading into the forest of baby<br/>
Christmas trees.  He follows this path until he sees a broken tree 5 feet<br/>
off the trail to the right.  It's an 8 foot tall stump with big broken<br/>
limbs laying horizontally and a woodpecker hole near the top.  Settled in<br/>
for a long winter's nap, he finds Santa's Playground letterbox #1 here, a<br/>
stamp showing one of these beautiful pine trees in its holiday finery.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing southward on the deer path, sometimes bushwhacking, sometimes<br/>
not, Santa heads southward. (When you live at the North Pole, you have no<br/>
option but to travel south, and Santa finds this suits him well.) <br/>
Eventually he walks down the hill and joins the main trail again.  He<br/>
turns left (southeast), then right toward the upper pond.  Traveling<br/>
clockwise around the pond, he enjoys watching the babbling brook tumbling<br/>
down its rock-lined path.  If the four pond poles at the drainage pipe<br/>
are 12:00, then Santa walks between two trees at 11:00 onto a trail with<br/>
a rocky start.<br/>
<br/>
He follows this generally southwest, stepping over rocks and roots along<br/>
the way.  This trail is vaguely blazed red, and Santa is used to being<br/>
guided by something red, so he decides to continue this way.  He passes<br/>
the lower pond, which is on his right, making a mental note that the<br/>
green skating shack could use a little sprucing up for the elves who come<br/>
here for ice skating in the winter, fishing in the summer.  Past the<br/>
pond, he turns south toward the pavilion.  He joins in on a game of<br/>
horseshoes with his navigational team, but their aim is too good for the<br/>
likes of Santa.  He pumps some water to help dust a little ashes and soot<br/>
off his suit, then heads for the southwest corner of the pavilion. <br/>
Moving in the direction of the fence corner, with each step of his left<br/>
foot he calls off the name of another one of his reindeer, then turns to<br/>
the right (290 degrees) and does it again.  Under a rock at the base of a<br/>
tree here is Santa's Playground letterbox #2.  This stamp is of Santa's<br/>
kitten, Snowball, who pops out of the pavilion chimney and invites Santa<br/>
to play with her on the playground.  Santa stamps in, then heads down to<br/>
swing on the swings, making note of the elf-sized picnic table nearby.<br/>
<br/>
Tired, relaxed, and happy, Santa and Snowball continue down past the<br/>
playground and onto the main trail, heading left toward the road.  They<br/>
bear right at the fork just before the fence and cross a small bridge,<br/>
then pass the brick caretaker's building, coming out into a clearing and<br/>
turning left toward the pole gate and the waiting sleigh.<br/>
