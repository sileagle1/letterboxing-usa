You did us all a favor by going through with this!  There's always going to<br/>
be one official who is leary in future, but letterboxers (being the<br/>
gentle-to-the-land type!) are the kind of folks that I for one would<br/>
welcome on National Forest lands.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course it's up to us all to live up to the high standards of land<br/>
stewards, as well as box stewards!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Folks,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In June, 1999 I contacted officials of the Gallatin National Forest to<br/>
ask<br/>
&gt; permission to put out some letterboxes on the land they control. Six<br/>
weeks<br/>
&gt; later, tired of waiting, I went ahead and put out the five Hyalite Creek<br/>
&gt; letterboxes that are listed under Montana on the LBNA Web page.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I got a call just before Christmas asking me to come in and talk a little<br/>
&gt; with the GNF officials about what I wanted to do. I did that, somewhat<br/>
&gt; uncomfortably avoiding mentioning that I had jumped the gun and already<br/>
&gt; placed the boxes. After that discussion I was told I would receive<br/>
&gt; permission to put the boxes out. That permission arrived in the mail<br/>
today!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as I know, the Hyalite Creek letterboxes are the first approved<br/>
&gt; letterboxes on National Forest land. There's been some talk on this list<br/>
&gt; about hesitating to ask permission for fear it would be formally denied,<br/>
&gt; making it difficult for all of us to "get away with" placing unapproved<br/>
&gt; boxes on federal lands. I'm happy to say that now there is at least a<br/>
tiny<br/>
&gt; bit of precedent for permission being granted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm still not convinced it's a good idea to tempt fate by asking<br/>
permission,<br/>
&gt; but at least this one time it was successful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; Dear Mr. Sheehan:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This letter is a follow-up to your earlier meeting with Dave Cary of my<br/>
&gt; staff, regarding the placement of "letterboxes" in specific locations in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Hyalite Creek drainage. No permit will be required.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may place the boxes (3"x9"x12" ammo boxes) as listed in the<br/>
descriptions<br/>
&gt; you submitted (copy enclosed). We will review the locations over the next<br/>
&gt; few years to ensure that there are no excessive impacts by visitors who<br/>
&gt; travel to the sites.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please coordinate with Dave Cary if you wish to place other boxes on the<br/>
&gt; Bozeman Ranger District in the future.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>

Congratulations to you to have gone through the "permission" process!!<br/>
That bodes well for letterboxing for all of us. I don't know how<br/>
independant various National Forests are from one another, but this at<br/>
least gives park officials elsewhere something to lean on when they<br/>
(hopefully) respond as favorable! Nice work!<br/>
<br/>
Now, for all the rest of us, rights and responsibility are always<br/>
linked. A good time to reaffirm our credo of stewardship and continue,<br/>
as we have done, a policy of non-destructive letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
Good work!!!<br/>
