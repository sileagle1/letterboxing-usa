&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hey!  I have been looking for the recipe for that!  Anyone have it?<br/>
<br/>
Here is a easy and really tasty way to cook a springchick. You do <br/>
need a decent smoker.<br/>
<br/>
Coat whole chicken with olive oil; rub with seasoning (your favorite <br/>
season salt mix will do)<br/>
<br/>
OR<br/>
<br/>
Brine chicken overnight (soak in water w/ salt, sugar, garlic, other <br/>
spices) <br/>
<br/>
Open Beer can; shove up butt.<br/>
Smoke with mesquite or hickory (or you favorite smoking wood) for <br/>
about 5 hours (about 225F)<br/>
Remove beer can. Eat (the chicken that is)<br/>
<br/>
This even freezes well as we just found out a couple of days ago <br/>
after we finally thawed a leftover chicken from a late summer party.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Her Ladyship is MOST upset with you. Always anxious to expand her<br/>

Springchick. Finding the instructions a bit odd when the step<br/>

assured her Ladyship that this step should be taken literally. Well,<br/>
after 3 embarrassing days in the hospital and suffering what is most<br/>
assuredly the worst blow to her Ladyship's reputation we find no<br/>
choice but to file suit to find some recompense for your irresponsible<br/>
"recipe" and lax use of the Queen's English. Expect to be hearing from<br/>
her Ladyship's solicitors. And please, dear discuss list readers, do<br/>
NOT attempt this recipe! Or, if you must just remember the beer goes<br/>
IN the CHICKEN.<br/>

Shouldn't that be an offshore bank?  Or at least the one upon which it <br/>
