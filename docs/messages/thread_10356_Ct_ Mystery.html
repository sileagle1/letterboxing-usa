Planted by Butterfly<br/>
Somewhere in Southern Ct.                                            A  <br/>
MYSTERY<br/>
<br/>
                      The  ANNIVERSARY  SURPRISE<br/>
<br/>
                           Neither Rain<br/>
                           Nor Sleet<br/>
                           Or Cold<br/>
                           Or Heat<br/>
                           Can keep Alan from his favorite beat.!<br/>
<br/>
        They arrived at the Inn almost together. He from the North ,    <br/>
         unconventionally , and she from the sandy South and over<br/>
         the bridge.<br/>
         The Inn was not even open as they met in the early dawn.<br/>
         Greetings over and stamps all tucked away, it was now time<br/>
         for both to be on their way. He traveled again North with the<br/>
         Red and soon reached an intersection with the White. Continuing<br/>
         north, he began counting his paces. Getting close to 70 paces, <br/>
he   <br/>
         began to slow down. On his left were two  double  trees , and <br/>
on his<br/>
         right about 15 steps off trail was a double  rock.  He laughed <br/>
as it<br/>
         looked like a mother and baby rock. About half way to the rocks<br/>
         and due north, a scramble in the brush found him at his treasure<br/>
         hiding in the hollow of a tree<br/>
<br/>
            Happy One Year of Letter Boxing Alan, Letterboxer 2002,<br/>
            and many more.  Have a Butterfly Day.        <br/>
