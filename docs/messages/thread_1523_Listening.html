wide on this one. Notice the opportunity to  learn here and we can <br/>
be  better. I have missed boxes that are probably there,  I carry <br/>
supplies for instant repair of a site just in case, and I carry a new <br/>
box on each hike you may just see a great spot someone else  passed <br/>
by. Lets not get to complicated  just let an owner note if a box is <br/>
gone astray, if out of reach for a check .... well thats the way it <br/>
goes.  Noting in the message board when  one is found is nice and it <br/>
is great to hear when someone  enjoys a site you found nice enough to <br/>
hide one in.<br/>
    I have checked in at the egroups  letterbox chat area several <br/>
times when the site looks busy just to see if anyone is there. A <br/>
gathering of minds  would be fun . How about Saturday night 9 p.m. <br/>
eastern time. See you in there.  Carol , Leader of the Pack<br/>
