                    <div class="plaintext-content">I see 105 boxes posted on AQ for the Charlotte area.  I'll be in the <br/>
area over Easter weekend and figured Sunday would be the best LB day <br/>
since many places will be closed.  Can anyone help me narrow down the <br/>
search to "must haves" or "must hunt fors"?  Also, if anyone would like <br/>
to meet up for exchanges that would be great, too.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
