<br/>Letterbox name: Ninigret Pond (2)

<br/>Clues:
<br/>
<br/>Ninigret Pond
<br/> <i>(October 6, 2002The first letterbox has finally been replaced...)
<br/>(September 24, 2002: the second box was replaced by a gracious friend...)</i>
<br/>Rhode Island's salt ponds are crucial estuarian hatcheries for a variety of wildlife. While the osprey has made a substantial recovery in this area, a small shore bird called the Piping Plover continues endangered. They require something we're not quite ready to provide: open space on undeveloped beaches. The 1999 Piping Plover Restoration Project at Ninigret Pond resulted in 8 nesting pairs raising 25 chicks to fledge. Peak nesting season on the beach is from early spring to late summer: Ninigret Conservation Area is open during this period. It is also quite beautiful during the fall and winter.
<br/>Directions: This is really two separate hikes separated by a short drive: for the first section take the Ninigret Park exit on RI Rt. 1. At the park, follow the signs all the way around to the nature trails beyond the observatory and senior center. Park in the rocked-in area of the old Naval Airfield runway. This area can be exceptionally buggy!
<br/>Walk to the information board in the southeast corner and take the trail to your right heading southwest. Bear left (south) at the fork and walk  mile to an observation tower. Enjoy the view of the pond before stamping in to the first letterbox, hidden 18 steps southeastof the little info board there. Hug the left side of the trail and lookunder a flat stone in the bushes to the northeast.
<br/>Returning to your car, head south on Rt. 1 (you'll need to first drive north before flipping a U-turn). Drive several miles to East Beach Rd. (again making a U-turn), and follow it to the end. Turning left you'll find beach parking in a block or two.
<br/>Beach comb your way east along the barrier strand separating Ninigret Pond from the sea for about 3 miles, until you reach the Charlestown breach way, Ninigret's opening to the ocean. Turning left, follow the breakwater north until it loops west into a sandy cul de sac with fenceposts surrounded by beach bayberry, rose, and poison ivy. Now follow the 4-wheel drive road that parallels the beach back towards the west a short way, until you see a boardwalk heading north to Ninigret Pond. This is the Arnoldia Nature Preserve area: a short way down the boardwalk, with a defunct privy nearby, your reward is tucked under the large square deck, in the northeast corner, between the deck and it's supporting cinderblock foundation. You can return to your car via either the beach or the 4-wheel drive road that parallels it. Enjoy!
