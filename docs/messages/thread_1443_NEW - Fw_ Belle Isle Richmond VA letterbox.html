<div><br/></div>Jay: I thought I would jot down a clue list and see if you would 
post them<br/>on the website. The "hitch-hiker" is currently with this letterbox. 
Please<br/>feel free to explain what to do with it when entering our clues. If 
you ever<br/>happen to be "up north" you will certainly enjoy the letterbox on 
the top of<br/>Mt. Tammeney NJ. The views are spectacular!!!  The trails are 
extremely<br/>steep and rocky!! One trail up is 2.5 miles and the other shorter 
but MUCH<br/>more agressive and challenging is only 1.5 miles. Taking a lot of 
water and<br/>a camera is recommended. I try to take a photo and keep it with the 
stamps<br/>that I have found with my personal letterbox book. The is another 
letterbox<br/>directly across the Delaware Water Gap in PA called Mt. Minsi. We 
didn't get<br/>a chance this past weekend but plan on trying that one out soon. 
It is and<br/>even higher elevation that Mt Tammeney. My 79 yr old Mom made it to 
the<br/>top!! She is remarkable. All the "half-dead" 20 somethings at the top 
were<br/>almost embarrased to be so tired when she showed up. Go for 
it!!<br/><br/>Many thanks!! Mary Jo, Stephen and Kyle Morgan<br/><br/>Route 95 to 
Richmond. Take route 301 South (South Belvidere Street.) Turn<br/>left at light 
on bridge to Belle Isle (follow the brown colored Belle Isle<br/>signs). Go past 
Ethyl Corp Headquaters on right. Straight thru next light.<br/>Right at bottom of 
hill south on 5th street. Right at stop sign on to<br/>Tredegar Street. Go past 
Civil War Visitor Center. (Make sure to take time<br/>and visit. It is fabulous 
and free!) Park in the Belle Isle parking lot<br/>(under route 95 highway). NOTE: 
Do not park directly under the RR. Hot tar<br/>has been known to fall and damage 
the car's finish. Take the foot bridge<br/>over to Belle Isle. Note river 
underneath.  We have seen Bald Eagles and<br/>sited  stripped bass if 
the water is clear.Enjoy the James River it is one<br/>of this nations treasures. 
We suggest packing a lunch or snack and relax on<br/>the huge boulders that cross 
the river.<br/><br/>1.  Off the foot bridge go to the roofed information 
booth. Continue on the<br/>path till you get to the four fork 
intersection.<br/>2.  Go up the trail no car can travel.<br/>3.  At fork 
in trail go left to the top (washed out gully on right).<br/>Continue to the top 
till you get to the concrete depression.<br/>4.   At the depression 
continue around to the left.<br/>5.   At the fork go 
straight.<br/>6.  At the four way fork, take the path at 320 
degrees.<br/>7.  At the next intersection go right down the "Jurasic Park" 
looking trail.<br/>You should be able to hear the river.<br/>8.  At fork go 
left up the hill.<br/>9.  At next intersection you should see a large triple 
trunk tree. Continue<br/>straight on the trail.<br/>10.Watch your footing. Step 
over the log in the trail and you will not fail!<br/>11. At next intersection go 
straight...or meet your fate!<br/>12. Go 8 paces to the next intersection and go 
up the hill for a short<br/>distance.<br/>13. Go right at the next intersection 
until you come to a "zig-zagged"<br/>intersection.<br/>14. Turn left at this 
intersection. Do not fear!! The letterbox is near!!<br/>15. Go 6 paces and you 
will see a fallen tree. You will locate the Belle<br/>Isle letterbox in it's 
base.<br/>16. The letterbox is well hidden from view. PLEASE return it exactly as 
you<br/>have found it for the next letterboxer.<br/>PS. The writing on the stamp 
was done intentionally in that style.<br/>Hope ya'll 
enjoy!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></body></html>
