New Haven.  Music Woman , Bluebird and I plodded around in the rain<br/>
today and had the greatest time . Russ and Sadie have put together a<br/>
great hike and carved four beautiful stamps . How special they make me<br/>
feel with a note on the third box.  Russ--the airplane is perfect, but<br/>
hay, it needs to be powder blue ink !!<br/>
Thank you both for a most enjoyable hike and lovely stamps.  note--in<br/>
the rain today, we took the wimpy way down and quit while we were ahead,<br/>
at the end too..[smile]  The views of New Haven are 'Above it All"<br/>
