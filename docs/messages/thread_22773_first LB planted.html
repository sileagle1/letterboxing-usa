                    <div class="plaintext-content">i am very pleased to announce that <br/>
we have planted our FIRST LETTERBOX!!<br/>
<br/>
DUNE FLYER <br/>
the clues are a poem<br/>
and the stamp is a Hang glider soaring the dunes<br/>
<br/>
we hope that someone will go searching for it <br/>
and let us know that they found it<br/>
<br/>
we love LBing near many of the places that we are Hang Gliding or <br/>
Motorcycle riding and really did not think that we would make one <br/>
ourselves, but this seemed like something we HAD to do<br/>
