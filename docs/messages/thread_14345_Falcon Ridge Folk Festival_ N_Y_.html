arrange to meet at the festival and exchange stamps and stories. <br/>
Also, if anyone knows of great letterboxes in the Berkshires (I did <br/>
print out some clues from the main website) and in the Hillsdale, <br/>
N.Y. area (I have NO clues for here..), that would be much <br/>
appreciated. <br/>
