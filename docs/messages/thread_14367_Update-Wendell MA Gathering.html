Wendell State Forest Gathering, Saturday August 16th, starting at 10:00am<br/>
Get out your party hats! Gingerblue and Deanne, the lazy letterboxer, have planned a 5th birthday celebration for the first letterboxes planted in Massachusetts. We will gather under the pavilion at Wendell State Forest starting at 10:00am for a day of letterboxing, stamp exchanging, food, fun and festivities.  The pot luck lunch is scheduled for around 1:00pm, please contact us off list (gbheron@netzero.net or deebes@net1plus.com)  to let us know what you'd like to bring. We will fill in the rest as well as birthday cake and watermelon for dessert.  If you would like to take part in the "birthday present exchange" please bring a small (under $5) gift wrapped present (suggestions: rubbermaid container, inkpad, notebook or whatever).<br/>
There is a $5.00 per car parking fee.<br/>
Swimming, a volleyball net and a horseshoe pit are located close to the pavilion. <br/>
We hope to see you there!<br/>
