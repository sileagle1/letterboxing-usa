I usually tune out of the carving media threads (those who have seen my<br/>
work can understand why -- tho some have found the lemonade in the lemons), <br/>
but I figured I'd pass this along for the interested ... I don't know if<br/>
this will be useful to y'all or not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in almost 4 years of letterboxing, I've never been able to walk <br/>
into a place around here and find decent sized erasers without the hassle <br/>
of mail order, sponging off of others, etc. until today.  Pearl Art at<br/>
4th and South in Philly (across the street from Jim's Steaks, where the<br/>
"philly cheesesteak" was allegedly invented) has this huge box of 3''x.1.5''<br/>
Staetdler Mars plastic erasers.<br/>
<br/>
I think I was more taken aback by the quantity they had than anything else.<br/>
It was an embarrassment of riches after so long a quest. <br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I don't know if these are decent erasers for letterboxing, but<br/>
if you've been questing decent sized erasers, check out Pearl Art (apparently<br/>
it is a national chain, and they have a web site and mail order catalog).<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
