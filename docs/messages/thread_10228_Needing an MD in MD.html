<div>In-laws have left (after a merry visit) and we have 1-1/2 hours before a dinner engagement, so we herd the kiddies to the car and off we go in pursuit of our first Maryland letterbox!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When last we left team BeMa, Da was recovering from back surgery and Na had done something to her knee.  So, off we went, hobbling across the playground in search of a bit of spring.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Shuffle, shuffle, limp, limp...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The day was freezing but, we had a wonderful time finding The Lily of the Valley Box.  The stamps had so many interesting sides that we tarried in the icy wind for a little two long artistically stamping our books and ended up with numb fingers!  frostbite?!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Shuffle, shuffle, limp, limp, numb, numb...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We pile back into the car, turn the but warmers on full blast, sit on our hands (all but Da who was, after all, driving) and head over to find Burnie T. Frog!  Across the frozen tundra (or soccer field, actually), past the baseball field which had a soccer ball sitting on the pitcher's mound (for some reason, this REALLY cracked up the kids!?!) and into the woods.  We checked a wrong stump or two but found Burnie T and issued him greetings from the Eagle mascot at the kids' school.  While leaning over to look in the box, we found our first hitchhiker ever!  Happy New Year 2003!  We were all soooo excited!  Mom leaned over for a closer look just as Be was doing a victory jump in the air with fist exultingly thrust up into....  Mom's eye!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Shuffle, shuffle, limp, limp, numb, numb, black eye...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A little worse for the wear...  we showed up at our friends house for their dinner party.  Of course, everyone else was nicely dressed, women and girls fresh from a tea party, dad's in slacks, and us -- cold, mussed, in jeans with pine needles hanging out of the pockets (part of Ma's "nature collection" from the first box...).  What we lacked in attire, though, we made up in enthusiasm though as Be and Ma proceeded to gush about the hitchhiker we just picked up and had waiting in the car...  The looks on the other parents faces....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While they were trying to figure that out, our family headed over to the buffet set up, and, in true BeMa style, merrily shuffled, limped and blinked our way over to the appetizers!  YUM!</div>
