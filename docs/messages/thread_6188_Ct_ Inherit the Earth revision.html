been moved to a new nearby site. Could the webmasters please ammend <br/>
the clues as follows: <br/>
<br/>
" Enjoy the view you have to drive all the way to Vermont to find a <br/>
beeter one!" Then add after that -  Face the cliff enjoy the view. <br/>
Turn around see the wall in the distance on right follow the wall to <br/>
the ring of fire. View white pine at  280 degrees . Behind the pine <br/>
under a rock  you will find your treasure.  <br/>
<br/>
Follow up with   " Simple  right"  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks webmaster for the change.  I will have one more box I will <br/>
move this upcoming week due to parks concerns for the integrity of <br/>
the stonework. I will say at least at Inherit that many of the stones <br/>
removed were for  colloege kids fires. I think a few may have been <br/>
moved in the search for the box I put those back on the wall.   <br/>
Thanks all.    leader of the pack<br/>
