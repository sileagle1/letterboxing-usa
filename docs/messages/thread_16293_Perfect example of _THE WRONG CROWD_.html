W O W this has got to be a real bummer!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I just read message #34393 about a box stolen and I am appauled that <br/>
some A** would even DO such a thing.  I was there on 9/23 and all was <br/>
well.  Now this ignorant jerk has "the info" (the standard info sheet <br/>
included in many boxes I've stamped in) to get on this site and LBNA <br/>
to look up boxes in this area and randomly go and destroy boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
I am new to letterboxing in New Jersey and this really, really <br/>
stinks.  I haven't planted MY first box yet but now I have second <br/>
thoughts of planting if some JERK can steal my hard work!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I am trying to make arrangements to attend your gathering 10/26 <br/>
but I don't think I will be able to attend.  It should be a blast.  <br/>
That park is wonderful.  Been there several times.  If I can't attend <br/>
I hope your turn out is good and a good time is had by all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy 'lboxing to all,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; How frustrating!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was checking on one of my boxes this evening, and it has been<br/>
&gt; stolen. It wasn't out there long.  During the time it was hiding we<br/>
&gt; checked on the box 2 seperate times and all was well.  It will not <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; replaced so consider your image a historical momento.  Appears <br/>
someone<br/>
&gt; in a car slide down the hill by the tracks and got stuck.  Maybe <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; are the culprits.  Lots of new broken beer bottles there tooo.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This sux, so now there is a "letterbox destroyer" loose in Southern<br/>
&gt; New Jersey, beware!!!!!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is THE BEST example of the "WRONG TYPE OF CROWD TO BE INFORMED <br/>
OF<br/>
&gt; LETTERBOXING"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening.<br/>
