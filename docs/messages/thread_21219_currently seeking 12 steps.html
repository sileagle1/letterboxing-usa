Hi, my name is K and this is brenstarling... we are letterboxing <br/>
addicts.  We must confess to our recent binge.  Today, we lost 11 <br/>
hours of our lives to letterboxing.  Even though it was dark, and <br/>
snowing, and freezing cold, we had to have just one more!  But you <br/>
can never have just one more...  there is always another, just <br/>
around the corner. And you think to yourself, "after this one, we <br/>
are going home" but there is always another box on the way home!  <br/>
Thank God our husbands are addicts too.  We have sucked friends and <br/>
strangers into our never ending chase.<br/>
We have come to accept that we are powerless over letterboxes (step <br/>
1).  But we hear that there is a really great stamp in the box for <br/>
step 2.<br/>
