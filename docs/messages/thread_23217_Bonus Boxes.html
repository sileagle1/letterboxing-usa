I have one in mind that I would like to add to one of my plants.  Do  people <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have done it both ways.  Most of the time, I include a bonus box clue inside the main box, either in the back of the log book or on a separate slip of paper.  But I have also included it right in the text of the main clue as kind of a "read between the lines" type of thing.  Either way is fine, and I am sure there are even other ways that people have led the finder to a bonus box.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I write the clues in the back of the logbook with a little note in the front saying to check the last page for bonus (in small letters) - and usually put a reading from where the original box was found to the bonus.  My clues on LBNA might say something vague for instance, I have Doors of Durin from Lord of the Rings posted and I say something like - "Beware of the Cave Troll".  If the person is intuitive, they pay close attention to the logbook.  <br/>
<br/>
  I've seen some where the person has a separate baggie in the box with clues printed and cut to small sizes so the finder can take the paper with them.  Another example is a laminated card in the box with clues and you have to write them down in order to find the bonus.  <br/>
<br/>
  Hope this helps!  Enjoy!<br/>
