                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All,  For anyone who isn't up to date Jan. 28 is the date of our <br/>
upcoming gathereing at Vernon, Ct.  There are a good number of boxes <br/>
within a 1/2 hour drive. There is an EMS store at nearby Buckland <br/>
Hills Shopping, Kathy Johns Ice Cream shop in Storrs section of <br/>
Mansfield has a great albeit cramped rubberstamp shop. I am trying to <br/>
organize some day boxes, there will be some doorprizes and a carving <br/>
competition for the crafty. I will keep the kids busy before dinner <br/>
with a couple of games adapted to letterboxing . An event only stamp <br/>
will be there as well as the opportunity to exchange stamps with <br/>
others. <br/>
    To reach Tolland Ag. Center  take Rte 84 to exit 67 ( Rte 31 <br/>
Coventry /Rockville) At end of ramp turn right if coming in from the <br/>
east (toaward Rockville) Coming from hartford area take exit 67 turn <br/>
left at end of ramp pass Burger King now all : to traffic light, stay <br/>
in right lane. Turn right pass Bess Eaton donut, McDonalds, a bank <br/>
and then the fairgrounds is right there sign at the steet says <br/>
Tolland Ag. Center On the Right there is a school opposite driveway.  <br/>
We will be in the second building the yellow one. <br/>
<br/>
    To go on to Mansfield hop back on the highway to exit 68 get off <br/>
following signs to UCONN (basketball and all that) .Rte 195 takes you <br/>
right into town. <br/>

Have you already carved the event stamp? Could we volunteer to do <br/>
that and bring it up? And trying to plan around the kid's busy <br/>
schedules, what times are you thinking of?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much, Carolyn, for single handedly putting this all <br/>
together!<br/>
