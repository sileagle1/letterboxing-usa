<div>Hi all,</div>
<div>Ok, several things here. First, I'm glad you liked 
the "Timberlin Park" series Alan. And you are right, the marks are a shade of 
lime green, Jay could you please revise. Speaking of Jay, PLEASE change the 
Timberlin Park to ESAK and the missing Eubrontes to S. Pike and Frogger. The 
"What's New" page has it incorrect. On another note, we took a trip down to 
Essex for the "Fab Four" series the other weekend. Jay this is a great hike to 
do with kids. Thanks again. We did get a little mixed up at one point and 
thought we were on one trail but found out we were totally wrong. Good 
thing we had the map to find our way out. Speaking of finds we did manage to 
find three out of five. We'll be back for the others I'm sure. </div>
<div>And as for the Chatfield Hollow boxes, we managed 
to find the first four but nightfall hindered two attempts at finding the 
treasure box. I hope there is still treasure to be found.</div>
<div>Lastly, I read a couple of new boxes 
were added to the "Black Dog" hike on my birthday and thought, what a great 
birthday gift for me. I'll be the first to stamp in. On my mountain bike I went 
last night, battery charged ready for my light and stamp in hand. If you haven't 
tried letterboxing at night, you may want to. It's pretty cool. Well 
anyway, as my luck would have it, the "Leviathan" and the "Guardian" were 
stamped in first on MONDAY by you know who. Alan, can you guess?  These are 
great stamps that Aili and Bruce carved. Some of the finest detail I've seen 
around. Well, I guess I can claim to be the second to stamp in (big deal). Well 
that's it for now.</div>
<div>See ya.</div>
