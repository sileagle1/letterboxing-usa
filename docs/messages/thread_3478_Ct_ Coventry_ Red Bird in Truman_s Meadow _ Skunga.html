                    <div class="plaintext-content"> In Coventry take Rte 31 from Rte 44 going south. turn onto  South <br/>
River road. Follow as it wanders along the river past Hickory Ridge <br/>
Tree Farm and to the end and stop. Turn left and cross the river on <br/>
Seagraves road.  Stop and pull off by a yellow gate at Truman's <br/>
meadow. Ths was once farmland and is now state owned field. It is <br/>
used by a model airplane club please don't disturb the runway or any <br/>
of their  markings.<br/>
   To find the boxes enter next to the yellow gate and followthe dirt <br/>
road down toward the meadow when the road bends to the right stay <br/>
with it. the river is now straight ahead down a little path. Go to <br/>
the river and enjoy the view. This is a great fishing spot. After <br/>
enjoying the river put your back to the are oak and take 28 paces ( <br/>
count only left foot for paces)back the way you came. Then look left <br/>
your red bird is perched under a small crabapple tree. Please rehide <br/>
exactly so others may seek her spot. Now to find the Skungamaug River <br/>
box. From a frequency control board for planes take a compass bearing <br/>
of 280 degrees  to a Cedar tree. Your  river box is hidden here <br/>
hopefully above the flood plain. Stamp quietly and rehide exactly. If <br/>
you come here when the plane club is here some members know the cub <br/>
scouts were having a scavenger hunt here as I told them that. So you <br/>
could continue in that line by informing them you are checking on the <br/>
cubs  hunt. For you Coventry Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts I hope you <br/>
enjoy these boxes! From Leader of the Pack with help from Lixo and <br/>
Topper<br/>
