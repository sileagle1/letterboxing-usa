I was up at Stone Faces today to pick up the third of three boxes hidden<br/>
there.  I'm glad I found it because it marked my 50th find.  Yipee!!  I<br/>
also had quite a time locating the first two boxes but after some<br/>
searching (I'm ashamed to say many hours later) my friend and I came<br/>
upon the spot.  I even found the 2nd one before the 1st one.  I believe<br/>
I was the 3rd or 4th person to stamp in.  I saw your note you left so I<br/>
thought that I would let you know that they can be found and are in good<br/>
shape.<br/>

Hi M + P,<br/>
<br/>
I was up at Stone Faces today to pick up the third of three boxes hidden<br/>
there.  I'm glad I found it because it marked my 50th find.  Yipee!!  I<br/>
also had quite a time locating the first two boxes but after some<br/>
searching (I'm ashamed to say many hours later) my friend and I came<br/>
upon the spot.  I even found the 2nd one before the 1st one.  I believe<br/>
