You've got that right.  There is nothing like the satisfaction that <br/>
comes from figuring out a good mystery box.  It is almost euphoric when <br/>
you think you know it, hit the trail, and it is actually there.  I wish <br/>
more folks would at least give them a go, I think they will be hooked <br/>
after just the first find.<br/>

&gt; You did better than I!  I'm pretty sure I know where one location<br/>
is, and I'm thrilled.  But if I'm right, I'm going to have to be there<br/>
in mid-afternoon.  Wonder if the Red Queen will buy "I have to take a<br/>
2-hour lunch so I can go check out a letterbox clue"?  (With 45 days<br/>
until Christmas?)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm not gripping or griping about it! But will Obey my natural <br/>
&gt; &gt; curiosity to spend way to much time to try to solve it! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I already spent 3 hrs last nite copying all the images/text into a<br/>
&gt; word.doc so I could take notes from surfing the net for clue<br/>
&gt; locations. I learned what an enclave was with regards to the phrase<br/>
&gt; "Kentucky Bend" but h3ll if I know where in Chester County Randy was<br/>
&gt; standing!?!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Got total eye strain trying to read the phone nos on the store window<br/>
&gt; and sign, coming up only with a town for the A/C &amp; exchange. Actually<br/>
&gt; two towns -- big help!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So expect to spend hours upon days if not weeks working this clue(s)<br/>
