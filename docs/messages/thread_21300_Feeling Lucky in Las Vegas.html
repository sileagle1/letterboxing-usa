Just got word that someone found the last lingering letterbox on the <br/>
Las Vegas Strip...the one I replanted to replace the original.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this person says the stamp is missing (which if it's true IRKS <br/>
me big time! Kill! Kill! Kill!  It was a nice carving, but SHEESH!  <br/>
It's only reportedly been found by one other person since New Year's) <br/>
but, I'm holding out hope that this person actually found the <br/>
original FEELING LUCKY planted by Jana which had also been reported <br/>
to have had its stamp missing.<br/>
<br/>
The last time I heard about this letterbox before I planted the <br/>
replacement someone else had suggested using the box lid (an M&amp;M mini <br/>
container) as the stamp...so, I found it curious to hear that again <br/>
this time.<br/>
<br/>
Can anybody shed any light on this?  My boxes' color was sort of <br/>
tortoise colored.<br/>

Oh happy day!  Just heard from the person and she confirmed that the box she found <br/>
(which, I'm embarrassed to say, I've never been able to find) was ORANGE, not BROWN <br/>
TORTOISE colored and contained loose sheets of paper, not my cheerful red logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm all smiles right now!<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe this is your year to feel REALLY lucky in Vegas.  It appears there are two finds in <br/>
the same spot and one actually has a really nice stamp.<br/>

Now, if it would only stop raining...<br/>

Gee whiz!  The persistence of the orange box!  I just got another <br/>
email with somebody saying the found Janaland's original Feeling <br/>
Lucky and "there's no stamp!"  There are TWO boxes in this <br/>
location...mine is BROWN, and reportedly has a stamp and logbook.  <br/>
The other is orange and has no stamp and loose sheets of paper.  I've <br/>
updated the clue on lb.org to point out this difference so hopefully <br/>
people will feel less "clueless" and I'll get less email about it.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if Janaland is still around or not, but I'd be just as <br/>
happy if the next finder of the ORANGE box pocketed it and walked <br/>
away.  I don't think she's planning on coming back to "service" it.<br/>

I hope that realroadrunner doesn't give in to the understandable <br/>

found it last weekend and it was one of the high points of my trip to <br/>
Vegas.  Because of it's location, it requires extra effort to remain <br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Glad you found it!  It is a tough spot for being discreet.  I'm sorry if I sounded overly <br/>
crabby about the "other" Feeling Lucky box (the ornage one without the stamp)...maybe its <br/>
because I'VE never found it :-)<br/>
<br/>
I won't pull either box for now...and as soon as all this rain stops, I'll go check on them.  I <br/>
know people really enjoy having that box on the Strip.<br/>

I found the orange box in September when we were in Vegas.  It took<br/>
two trips to find it.  The only way I could do it even semi-discreetly<br/>
is to be there at 4 in the morning but there was still lots of traffic<br/>
around.  I ignored them and they ignored me.  The stamp was missing<br/>
then but I did use the box to stamp in.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Glad you found it!  It is a tough spot for being discreet.  I'm<br/>
sorry if I sounded overly <br/>

the stamp)...maybe its <br/>

I found the orange box in September when we were in Vegas.  It took<br/>
two trips to find it.  The only way I could do it even semi-discreetly<br/>
is to be there at 4 in the morning but there was still lots of traffic<br/>
around.  I ignored them and they ignored me.  The stamp was missing<br/>
then but I did use the box to stamp in.<br/>

I tried too, while I was in Vegas...the crowds were uncooperative, and despite my best efforts...and scuffing my spiffy new shoes...I couldn't come up with the box. Another sigh. Tricksey boxes!<br/>
