Okay, if we're going to start talking about music related HHs, I'll post <br/>
now about a new series I hadn't intended to announce until this summer. The <br/>
first is already out and about, with more to come in the next few months.<br/>
<br/>
I'd originally hoped to do a series of actual boxes with a musical "extra" <br/>
to share with those who found it. My idea was to include in each box a CD <br/>
single of one of several songs by Kris Delmhorst, one of my all-time <br/>
favorite singer-songwriters. I'd intended to note in the clues that <br/>
searchers might want to bring along a portable CD player to get the most <br/>
out of the find, thinking they could listen as they stamped in. The more I <br/>
thought about it, though, the more inconvenient the idea sounded so I never <br/>
pursued it.<br/>
<br/>
Nine months later, I realized I could create a HH with a mini CD in it <br/>
instead, and people could listen (or not) in the comfort of their own home <br/>
before they dropped off the HH at its next stopping place. The HH itself is <br/>
traditional in every way except for this musical addition, which can be <br/>
easily ignored if desired.<br/>
<br/>
The Little Wings HH has already set flight with theme music in tow - you <br/>
can track its travels here if you're curious:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A couple more HHs in the same series will head off into the wild over the <br/>
summer, and will be posted here with my other boxes:<br/>

<br/>
I'm curious to hear what other music related LB ideas might be forming <br/>
among the masses out there. :-)<br/>

I love this stuff.  The mini CD idea is stellar.  I have carved several <br/>
stamps in a series commemorating classic American folk songs, all of <br/>
which will be HH's.  The first one (or more?) is scheduled for launch <br/>
at the Great Lakes gathering May 31.  Look for Old 97 (the fastest mail <br/>
train) to roll into a station near you.<br/>

You just gave me a great idea.  Washington DC is known worldwide for the punk bands it spawned during the 80's and early 90's.  I have carved a series of band boxes to be placed in DC someday when the weather is nice.  I think I might jump on your idea and include a mini CD of the bands for the first finders.  <br/>
