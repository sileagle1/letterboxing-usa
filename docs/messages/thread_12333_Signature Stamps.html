avoided accumulation of carton-upon-carton of canning jars, glass <br/>

Did you carve that fishing fly?  I will be so totally impressed if <br/>
you say you did!  The Lab is great too. (Stars and Moon are cute too <br/>
Heidi) If you tell me they are store bought I think I will feel <br/>
better and might continue carving. <br/>
<br/>
I've just gotten started in carving and am seeing some improvement, <br/>
but I am sure a long way from that quality!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My last name is not Drew, so there's no way in heck I could carve <br/>
that thing!!! LOL    All 3 are store bought, actually my mom picked <br/>
them out and bought them for us one day after Patrick told me about <br/>
LB and I mentioned in from of Mom and Heidi.   She's a good mother!  <br/>
And had us pegged for good stamps too!   <br/>
<br/>
I too have just started carving, Heidi has no interest in being that <br/>
artsy!   I'm considering re-carving my firefighting series prior to <br/>
planting the boxes because they are quiet rough. I think the best <br/>
thing I have done so far is a Striped Bass and I just have to decide <br/>
either where to put it, or if it's going to be a HH.<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently contemplating a Traveler for Madras which will be a <br/>
variation of a milk-bone, and You'll have to supply a gift (be it a <br/>
pet on the head or a milkbone!) to receive it!  <br/>
