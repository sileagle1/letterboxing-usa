<br/>
This is my annual public service announcement that I will be <br/>
going "unplugged" effective Friday, June 18, 2004 and will not "plug <br/>
back in" until Friday, September 10, 2004.  If you have received this <br/>
public service announcement, it is because I communicate with you in <br/>
cyberspace.  For all you old timers, you know why.  For anyone <br/>
receiving this announcement for the first time, it is because I spend <br/>
the summer in a place with no running water, no electricity, and <br/>
hence no computer.  Any emails sent to me during this time will go <br/>
unanswered until my return in September.  If you need to contact me, <br/>
the only method of communication is my cell phone.  For those of you <br/>
with my cell phone number, you know what to do.  For those of you who <br/>
do not have my cell phone number but feel you need it, please contact <br/>
me via email before Friday, June 18, 2004.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the summer!<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Woman<br/>
