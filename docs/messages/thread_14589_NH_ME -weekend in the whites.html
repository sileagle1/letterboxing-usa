2 weeks of marine ecology on Friday to begin a weekend of bug <br/>
collecting and fantastic letterboxing with two new members in Maine: <br/>
CULEX and NAUTILUS - I'm very excited that these friends of ours are <br/>
now trying their hand at letterboxing. (successfully I might ad)<br/>
<br/>
We began our adventures at the "ELEPHANT HEAD" letterbox en route to <br/>
our campsite at the Zealand Falls campsite nestled in the White <br/>
Mountain National Forest. This box was intact and a nice find at Saco <br/>
Lake. Funny to see such a small lake for such a large river!<br/>
<br/>
The actual mission of the two day weekend was for the MES (Maine <br/>
Entomological Society) annual field collection trip. On Saturday we <br/>
scoured the trail all the way to the AMC Zealand Falls hut for <br/>
dragonflies, ground beetles, ticks, moose, mushrooms, frogs, <br/>
salamanders, and just about anything else that we could stop and note <br/>
in our field books!  Found 1 complete moose antler!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We exchanged our signature stamps with CULEX &amp; NAUTILUS over a toasty <br/>
campfire that evening and plotted Sunday's adventure in the North <br/>
Conway/Jackson/Pinkham-Notch area! <br/>
<br/>
The GLEN ELLIS FALLS box is definitely MIA unless we bounded the <br/>
wrong boulder... Who owns this box&gt;?<br/>
<br/>
On to "DIANA'S BATHS" which was a wonderful diversion from the <br/>
previous day's hike! This box is intact and only had a handful of <br/>
visitors.<br/>
<br/>
We finished up with a quick dip at the "EASTERN SLOPES INN RIVERWALK" <br/>
also in North Conway and then meandered back to Maine with a quick <br/>
detour in Fryeburg,Maine to plant the "STRONGBAD LETTERBOX" !!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
so- there you have it, our wild weekend in the whites.<br/>
Hope to meet many of you on the 9th!<br/>
