I had a wierd question aboout the digest, my<br/>
girlfriend signed up for it and now she never gets the<br/>
daily digest, Jen never got it to begin with.  She<br/>
went to sign up again and the server told her that she<br/>
was already registered.<br/>
The only idea I had was that she did not check any of<br/>
the junkmail boxes when she first registered.  Do you<br/>
need to accept the e-groups junk mail in order for<br/>
them to put you on the list.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, Chip,"The Ram" and myself did some<br/>
boxin' on Wednesday.  We hit "The Cold Force" then<br/>
headed out to Jamestown to get Collaboration.  Nice<br/>
views, but it was getting buggy!  We did some<br/>
snorkiling right there also it was great.<br/>

not experienced any problems, but i switch fairly regularly from e-mail delivery 
to daily digest and back.  eGroups can be unreliable 
though...  What I can say is that I have been able to receive daily 
digest without getting the other junk lists. </span><br/><br/><span class="453385612-15092000">jdw </span><br/></tt></p></body></html>
