Just returned from 11 days in Connecticut and Maine (mostly Maine) and introduced some friends to this great pasttime.  We looked for 13 LB's and found 10.   We found Book Barn (1 of 2) and Relax &amp; Read by Christi in Niantic, CT.  We found Porter Preserve (all 3) and Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens (2 of the 3) by Amymisha and Stoneworks (both) by Limur and Maine Lobster in Reid State Park.  I also found my first HH!!  What a treat!  I emailed the HH owner - is it ok for me to post here the name of the HH and where I found it?  I did send an email to the HH owner letting them know I found it and where but I assume I should not post the name of the LB where I place it.  Is there a time limit on putting it in it's new home?  I have a place in mind but can't get there for a month or more.  <br/>

This was so much fun and I really enjoyed getting out to do some hiking again.  My late husband and I used to go hiking in the cooler weather but I haven't done it in years.  I'd forgotten how much I enjoyed it and this gives me such a perfect reason to get out there again.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That was great that you contacted the owner.  Not everybody does that, but it is greatly appreciated by the owner.  Pete and Wanda have a website and they keep track of all the HHs on it.  Here's the URL:<br/>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/travelers.html<br/>
<br/>
There is also a group for HHs:<br/>
<br/>
letterbox_travellers@yahoogroups.com <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many people join this group and watch the postings for updates on their HHs.  As far as how long to hold on to it...usually one plants it as soon as possible so it keeps in circulation.  If you want to wait a month, my thoughts would be that you contact the owner and explain that you want to wait a month and the reasons why.  If they don't have a problem with that, go for it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

might be stalled for awhile.<br/>

Just my thoughts on the matter.<br/>

I'm glad you're back on the trails again.  This really is an enjoyable and addicting hobby.<br/>
By the way, what state are you from?<br/>
