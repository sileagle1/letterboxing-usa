Jeez, SpringChick, that was great. I mean that sincerely. Thanks. <br/>

I think that you were the first to judge and accuse when you posted a rant<br/>
yelling at letterboxers whom you feel do not properly maintain their boxes.<br/>
You don't know their lives either -- you don't know their circumstances,<br/>
their schedules, their financial, family and work obligations. But somewhere<br/>
in their most-likely hectic life, they took the time to create a letterbox<br/>
and put it out there -- a gift for the letterboxing community. They may<br/>
never hear anything further about it, it may go missing within days, or they<br/>
may get years of pleasant found reports. <br/>
<br/>
It is all a chance... both the planting and the finding. That is the nature<br/>
of letterboxing. If that is not something you can handle without feeling the<br/>
need to vent to the community as a whole, then perhaps as others have<br/>
stated, this is not the hobby for you.<br/>
<br/>
Slow down, smell the roses, enjoy the time spent with your kids. Think about<br/>
those people whom you deal with on a daily basis, and more close to home for<br/>
many here, a mid-atlantic letterboxer who just lost her daughter... don't<br/>
you think they would give just about anything to have just one more hike<br/>
with their child... with or without a letterbox?<br/>

you know..if someone came in my life that i dont know ranting and <br/>
raving i would try to help them and figure out WHY they were so <br/>
upset..I wouldnt judge them.torrment them or otherwise accuse them of <br/>
anything other than being upset..is that how YOU would treat someone <br/>
if you met them in person???this is really silly..my children are less <br/>
judgemental than some of you people here..like i said before im sorry <br/>
if anybody got offended..i posted here to get some support and make <br/>
new friends but really..you dont know me....God is the one true judge <br/>
here guys....not you<br/>
