Okay, I'm glad I didn't go where I thought the fairy falls letterbox <br/>
might be.  As I suspected, I forgot how to work my compass and was <br/>
looking in practically the oposite direction.  Duh!<br/>

IMHO I would say that "No Trample" or "Leave no Trace" should be taken to <br/>
mean that if someone comes along soon after you, that there would be no way for <br/>
them to tell you had been there.<br/>
<br/>
I try to make sure I don't crush plants (as much as is humanly possible) and <br/>
haven't left a definite path. ( I push stuff aside rather than step on it) I <br/>
also do a lot of artfully tossing leaves etc to cover any place I have sat down <br/>
or moved rocks that might be visible. <br/>
