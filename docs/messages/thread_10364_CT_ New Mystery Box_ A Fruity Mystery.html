<br/>Find this person for you to bother,
<br/>Who shares his name with some others.
<br/>Neither pastor, athlete nor musician,
<br/>Not philosopher or metaphysician.
<br/>
<br/>No "Sunshine" or "Honky Tonk,"
<br/>Do not worry, this is not bunk.
<br/>Go Two where they say Wyassup!
<br/>Then to Maine and then go up!
<br/>
<br/>Cross the Wood,
<br/>To where a Dairy Barn stood.
<br/>Up the stairs, 
<br/>And right for your affairs.
<br/>
<br/>Although a pastor may use
<br/>Hopefully you can't refuse.
<br/>After you take a sip,
<br/>Ask for a "special" tip.
<br/>
<br/>For near the sacrament divine,
<br/>Is a letterbox for you to find.
<br/>Stamp in and have fun
<br/>In the summer sun!</body></html>
