today! Princess Turtle and I spent half the time looking for parking <br/>
and getting lost. At one point I made a very bad wrong turn which led <br/>
us back to Arlington, VA. Turtle was yelling at me to hop the green <br/>
areas to turn around. She kept saying, "DC is across the river!" <br/>
(like I didn't know, DUH)<br/>
   We found the Smithsonian, no problem! Then headed for Orion the <br/>
Hunter, again, quick, easy find. Now comes the interesting part. She <br/>
wanted to find Egypt. I HATE ONE-WAY streets!!!! So I did a U turn in <br/>
the middle of 18th street to get me back in the correct direction. <br/>
Got a great parking spot finally and nabbed Egypt. <br/>
   After leaving Egypt we went to hunt down Thomas Jefferson.(Now <br/>
that's a sentence I never figured I would ever write) Well we got <br/>
lost again! Round and round we went. DC has too many circles. And to <br/>
make matters worse I made another wrong turn and wound up going <br/>
through a tunnel onto 395 which leads BACK to Arlington. By then we <br/>
were laughing so hard that we almost peed our pants! Finally made it <br/>
to the Jefferson Memorial and happened to park within 50 feet of the <br/>
letterbox. I guess the letterboxing gods took pity on us. <br/>
    It was a great day for boxing but a horrible day for parking. I <br/>
told her the next time we will take the metro.<br/>

the days of driving in Manhattan!!!  You forgot the part about the streets <br/>
changing names in the middle for no reason at all.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to hit the lottery and buy me that GPS system!!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you had lots of adventure after all (intended and unintended!)  <br/>
