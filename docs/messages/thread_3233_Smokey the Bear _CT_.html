enjoyable hike/walk thru Session Woods in Bristol. We were the first to stamp <br/>
in at all the boxes. We also bagged the #3 Christmas Series box which we were <br/>
also the first to do so. A clean sweep. Thank you Amy. But Amy, where are 1 &amp; <br/>

<br/>
Let me add my appreciation to Bill and Val and to Amy, especially for <br/>
planting those boxes so close to my home! On Sunday afternoon, the Crew from <br/>
Collinsville (the CT branch, not the IL branch!) - consisting of my friends <br/>
David and Sarah, their kids Rebekah (a/k/a Tiki) and Josh (the Squash), and <br/>
me - were the second group to lay claim to these letterboxes. As new as these <br/>
boxes are, I just had that funny feeling that we wouldn't be the first ones <br/>
to find them. Sure enough, I was right: when I saw that ESAK had stamped in <br/>
right before us at each of the five letterboxes, I smiled and nodded <br/>
knowingly. (Both ESAK and the Crew from Collinsville live one town away from <br/>
Sessions Woods, but in opposite directions.) One benefit, however, of <br/>
stamping in after ESAK was getting to see their brand new, personal <br/>
letterboxing stamp; it is most attractive and very colorful! Definitely one <br/>
of the nicest I've seen on the trails.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<well, "walkabout="" &="" <br="" bill="" know="" next.="" picked="" the="" up="" val,="" was="" we="" what="" you="" yup,="">
Hitchhiker" which was hanging out with Smokey himself. That's two hitchhikers <br/>
in one week -- not too shabby. The kids enjoyed all the extras too with <br/>
Smokey. 'Nuf said right? Thanks again. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ack! This is the second time I know of that I've *just* missed snagging a <br/>
hitchhiker. Some folks have all the luck, I guess. :-)<br/>
