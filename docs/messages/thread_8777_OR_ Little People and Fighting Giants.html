I went out and checked on Little People, it is alive and well. Because of <br/>
the rather gutsy placement on this box you have to actually "dig" for it.<br/>
<br/>
If you need any help Ryan just email me offl ist, the clues are a little <br/>
cryptic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, If someone has a brilliant idea on where to put the new Alice in <br/>
wonderland box, i would appreciate a little help. I keep going over there <br/>
trying to find a safe spot for her and haven't been able to come up with <br/>
anything. A different perspective would be nice as i am burnt out on ideas.<br/>

<br/>
Glad you liked my Burntwood clues.  It was my second box ever -- interesting <br/>
process:  first the stamp (just practicing), then the last minute decision to <br/>
throw together a box for a weekly walk, and afterward came the clues.   Dang, <br/>
I thought, I should have made a different stamp!  Then a voice spoke to me, <br/>
"Remember, there are no rules."  :P   In other words, I'm thinking to change <br/>
the stamp in that box.   I'll let y'all know.<br/>
<br/>
I tried getting the Little People box too.  First I dug this way and then I <br/>
walked around and dug at it that way and then went under there and dug <br/>
backwards.  I dug every which way around and still couldn't get to the <br/>
treasure.  Just couldn't reach!  Hah!  I put everything back where it <br/>
belonged and promised to come back when I grew longer arms.  Clever Lillis.<br/>
<br/>
Have you had your walk today?<br/>
