For all you pink eraser carvers out there.  Dollar Tree Stores are<br/>
getting in there back to school supplies!  Look for the Big Mistake<br/>
erasers. They came in everyday pink and green.  They measure in at<br/>
about 5 1/2 inches by 2 inches wide and 5/8 of an inch thick.  These<br/>
are very big pink erasers.  Cost?  You guessed it a buck, buck, buck!<br/>
 Some stores may also have the white erasers in 2 sizes.  Last year<br/>
the small size came in 6 packs,  the nice larger size came in 3 packs.<br/>
 These are a great size for stamps.  Have fun!  May everyday be an<br/>
adventure.<br/>
