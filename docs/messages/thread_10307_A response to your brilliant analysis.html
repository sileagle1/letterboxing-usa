<p>Dear Ms Borelli, </p>
<p>I write, under an alias, with regard to your words: </p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p><em>Also, if you start posting more than a few posts in a day, you'll begin to annoy people. Perhaps all of your 30 posts yesterday are inciteful, witty, and full of useful and interesting information, but I can assure you that most people aren't impressed. It's a busy board and few people have time to read ALL posts. If you start posting countless posts every day, people will start ignoring them. They don't have time for it.</em></p></blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">I prefer not to deal with you publicly or under my "real" name. Actually I prefer not to deal with you at all and so therefore any temptation you have for a response to this will <strong>not</strong> be read or responded to. Sorry to deprive you of your freedom of speech. While I do own this paints me with cowardice, at the same time, it allows me to be quite outspoken. I've had you blocked from my Yahoo mail account for months. Your posts are a waste of  life and that is the consensus of alot of people.  I cannot tell you how many people I have spoken to in person and off-list who think you are truly letterboxing's village idiot. What an incredible impression you have made on others.</p>
<p>Now to get my point across (which, if you haven't figured it out yet, is PLEASE SHUT UP AND GO AWAY!)with a response to your concerns about the number of posts made by someone to the LbNA list, let's begin by looking at some of YOUR numbers: </p>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>January, 2003 (through today) - 12 </li></ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>December 2002 - 20 </li></ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>November 2002 - 41 </li></ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>October 2002 - 56 </li></ul>
<div></div>
<ul>
<li>September 2002 - 24 </li></ul>
<div></div>
<p>'Nuff said? Perhaps you might like to conduct your own research to see who posts more than you. I have only glimpsed at the mostly garbage that you write when it is part of someone's response who I do not have blocked. But....in an effort to try to be fair to you before I tell you to that you are obnoxious beyond words, I skimmed through the Archives for some insight. </p>
<p>It seems, in my opinion of course, that at least 75% of your "incredible insights" into and comments about letterboxing are a response to some other person's experience...or your own. In case you've missed the various BIG hints from others infinitely wiser than you, responses of a personal nature to someone's letterboxing day should be dealt with off-list. You are not the only one guilty of this, by the way. </p>
<p>Do you think anyone, particulary total strangers who live all over the US, really cares about your cancer or your rescue or the boxes you have found or ALL the other irrelevant and empty-headed things you usually have to say? </p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p>Before you open your always too-big mouth, Ms Borelli, and continue humiliating yourself, why don't you take your own advice.The next time you are tempted to throw stones, Ms Borelli, you better board up your own glass house first. Your fan club grows smaller and smaller.</p>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Get ready to get really mad at me because I am about to stand up and <br/>
shout for my friend Psychomommy.  For those of you who are not <br/>
interested in reading about the ongoing hate spewed throughout this <br/>
site, please stop reading now.<br/>
<br/>
I have been sitting back feeling very comfortable in the knowledge <br/>
that I was above all of this backlash and hatemongering and keeping <br/>
my nose out of it.  I learned this unfortunate lesson because my <br/>
friend has been bashed several times by members of this group.  I am <br/>
not quite as thick skinned as my friend and would have been extremely <br/>
upset by that much hate being sent my way.  <br/>
<br/>
What angers me even more than sentiment behind these tirades is the <br/>
cowardice of those sending them.  If you have a strong opinion, <br/>
please stand up and be heard.  Although I have never particularly <br/>
enjoyed the back and forth that erupts on a semi-monthly basis, I at <br/>
least respect the fact that everyone has a right to their opinion and <br/>
deserves to be heard.  What I cannot wrap my brain around is why <br/>
people are so vicious to one another.<br/>
<br/>
I know this sounds like a load of hippie peace loving crapola, but I <br/>
was taught to respect others and treat them as I would like to be <br/>
treated.  Can we please treat each other like human beings?  I love <br/>
this hobby and I do not want to become so disgruntled with this site <br/>
that I stop pursuing it.<br/>
<br/>
I encourage you to share your opinions with me and with all of my <br/>
friends and acquaintances on this site, but please be civilized and <br/>
respect each other.  Life is too short and our pleasures too few to <br/>
clutter them up with this shit.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
