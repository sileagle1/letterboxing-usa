I just recently got into Letterboxing and LOVE it.  But... we are <br/>
looking up clues, and going to the trouble to look and they are not <br/>
there anymore, :(  I realize that this is a certain risk ya take, <br/>
it's just such a shame.<br/>
<br/>
Four families here all got into it at the same time, and we have all <br/>
gone at different times with out sharing knowledge to each other to <br/>
look these up and are all coming up with empty hands so I think it is <br/>
safe to say they are gone..  <br/>
<br/>
So far we can't find the Cooper Park box, and boxes 1, 6 and 7 of the <br/>
Tualitin Hills Nature Park series. We found 2 and 4, still need to <br/>
look for 3 &amp; 8, but creek trail is closed from flooding for a while <br/>
longer.  There is another a friend told me is missing, but I haven't <br/>
tried myself yet... <br/>
<br/>
I am working on a box myself and will post when I plant it, this is <br/>
so fun!  Woo Hoo!  Cyndie<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oooh, those Tualatin Hills boxes--there's been a bit of discussion about them <br/>
on this board.  It IS discouraging to look for missing boxes!  You might try <br/>
searching the Talk List archives before you go after a specific <br/>
box--sometimes you can learn the most recent scoop on a box that way.  (The <br/>
archive is ponderous to wade thru...but it can give you an idea when the last <br/>
reported sighting of a box was &amp; other pertinent info.)  If I recall <br/>
correctly, the Nail Family reported #3 at Tualatin missing as well.  <br/>
(Nobody's been able to get to 3 or 8, due to flooding, for a while.)<br/>
<br/>
The Cooper Park box was there back in Feb--if you want, e-mail me offline and <br/>
we can have a chat about where you looked.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I don't know if you've tried for the two Fanno Creek boxes yet, but one <br/>
appears to be missing (the one that requires walking over a big tree).<br/>
<br/>
But hey, we've got LOTS of boxes here in Oregon City, just crying out for <br/>
visitors.  On the Clackamas Community College grounds alone there are 8 <br/>
(planted by 3 different parties).  <br/>

Do you know about the PNW list?  It's all Northwest, all the time.  You're <br/>
