&gt;carbon dioxide molecule that I exhale.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is CO2 able to be offended ?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;As a human, any opinion I have (even if <br/>
&gt;it's something as piddly as a favorite color or<br/>
&gt;favorite type of chocolate or an experience along the<br/>
&gt;letterboxing trail) is bound to offend some other<br/>
&gt;living organism out there who also holds an <br/>
&gt;opinion.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mmm I'm not sure about that either !<br/>
<br/>
I'd vote for your right to hold an opinion contra to<br/>
mine anyday !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;This, too, is why so many folks have refrained from <br/>
&gt;participating on the LBNA-usa discussion board for so<br/>
&gt;many years.  <br/>
&gt;It's difficult to discuss things in this venue<br/>
without &gt;being considered a cad somewhere along the<br/>
way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ahh but you are !!<br/>
<br/>
<lol><br/>
<br/>
No no it's not true...I am teasing you...<br/>
<br/>
We DO LOVE YOU !!<br/>
<br/>
We do !<br/>
<br/>
Honest..<br/>
<br/>
well ...would you believe...girl scouts honor ?<br/>
<br/>
Er howsa about "spit in the dirt honor ?"<br/>
<br/>
<roflol><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Sorry if I've offended anybody--which I'm quite<br/>
&gt;certain I have.  I'd much rather be one that develops<br/>
&gt;and holds an opinion and defends it than one who<br/>
&gt;merrily toes the line with the masses without any<br/>
&gt;consideration for why they opine the way they do.   <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not my intent--<br/>
&gt;just participating in a lively discussion.  Guess<br/>
this &gt;isn't the venue for that.  <br/>
<br/>
Ohh dear oh dear oh dear....<br/>
Have a nice glass of milk and a cookie and come back<br/>
later <grin><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Back to the 'abyss'...<br/>
<br/>
Nice down here isn't it <grin><br/>
<br/>
The flames are hottest just close to the edge<br/>

<br/>
Sorry if I seemed to attack ...<br/>
<br/>
I'm getting everything wrong today...<br/>
<br/>
I do vote for my visitors books to be edited by<br/>
others..and also will not edit anyones' elses unless<br/>
they also say so in their books..but I'd probably tell<br/>
em by email if I found some nasty stuff there..and I<br/>
definitely would keep my kids from seeing gratuitous<br/>
filth...<br/>
<br/>
ha ..is that OK..or am I a cad too...<br/>
Can a gal be a cad ?<br/>
No lets not go THERE !<br/>
<br/>
I hope never to be fascinated by filth...that's all.<br/>
