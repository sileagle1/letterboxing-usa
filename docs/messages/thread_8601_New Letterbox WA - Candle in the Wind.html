<p align="LEFT"><span lang="en-us">Traveling north from Seattle, on I - 5, take time to Rest and if you are lucky enjoy a free coffee at “Smokey Point”. Here you will find piece of a giant Thuja Plicata that is over 1,000 years old. This Thuja Plicata had a 20-foot diameter and stood 200 feet tall. This is the 4th location for the stump and it is showing the wear of many hands touching it.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span lang="en-us">After reading the Giant's story, step inside and gaze east across the car parking lot. Eye ball the “Pet Area” sign and in line with that you will spot the back of a yellow shed through the left side of a clump of trees.</span></p>
<p align="LEFT"><span lang="en-us">Head for that clump, watching where you step as you traverse the Pet Area, and check down low behind a youthful thuja plicata, and near the fence to find the “ Candle in the Wind” at Smokey Point.</span></p>
