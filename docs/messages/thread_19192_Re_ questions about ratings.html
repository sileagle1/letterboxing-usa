gauge whether to take a hike (so to speak...) based on my state of <br/>
mind and the weather. Weather can also a huge factor in deciding to <br/>
go on a hike here in unpredictable New England.<br/>
  A standard rating system appeals to the orderly side of my <br/>
personality, but as stated above, can't factor in so many unknowns. <br/>
[weather/ physical fitness of the searcher/whethr kids or less able <br/>
hikers are along for the search.<br/>
  Also, placers are just a key-stroke away. I am sure any placer <br/>
would be amenable to offering personal advice about the trail to <br/>
their box if asked. <br/>
