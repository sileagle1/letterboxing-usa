                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all ... just came back from the L.A. area where I was all of last<br/>
week visiting a former classmate of mine from grad school.  Anyway,<br/>
interspersed with the "see-L.A." tourist stuff, I did a bit of 'boxing.<br/>
<br/>
There are some great hikes out there!  The San Gabriel Mountains and<br/>
the hikes in the Angeles National Forest are superb.  I highly<br/>
recommend the hike to Switzer Falls ... it was an easy, fairly flat<br/>
hike about 1 mile in to the falls, and then another 1/4 of a mile or<br/>
so to where the "lookout" was.  at 1.4 miles the trail intersected<br/>
with another trail and I saw that you could travel to the base of the<br/>
falls in another 7/10 of a mile.  It seemed from that point that I had<br/>
climbed a thousand feet or more, but I really hadn't.  I started from<br/>
the parking lot already at about 3000', and the falls basically fell<br/>
into a valley 300 or 400 feet below me at least, so I was up high<br/>
without actually having to climb too much!<br/>
<br/>
The scenery was wonderful!  I actually took the higher trail another<br/>
1/4 of a mile or so to where the mountain turned and took in a full<br/>
panorama of the place ... the sound of the waterfall was amazing and<br/>
just about the only sound out there.  It was later in the afternoon<br/>
(about 3:00) and as I was on the western side of the mountian, the sun<br/>
shone in highlighting the entire place in delightful and warm light. <br/>
The trail basically follows the edge of the mountain, and although<br/>
narrow at times, the entire time you hike you have a view.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I was not able to find the letterbox that was on this<br/>
hike, but I thank the placer anyway as I wouldn't have discovered this<br/>
wonderful place had there not been a box to hunt!<br/>
<br/>
Another observation:<br/>
<br/>
Most of the 'boxes I found in California were Altoid containers or<br/>
other small containers such as large pill bottles.  I never saw a<br/>
letterbox in a container simlar to what is in wide use in New England,<br/>
where I box mostly.  Very interesting.  Ink was never included, and<br/>
because the boxes were small, they were harder to find in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to exclude anyone intentionally, but a couple of my<br/>
favorites were:<br/>
* the box at the Getty Center - a covert box for sure and a fantastic<br/>
place to visit,<br/>
* the hike to Switzer Falls and beyond (even though no box was there)<br/>
* the hike up Mount Hollywood (again, the box was missing, but a great<br/>
hike none-the-less)<br/>
* the hike (and found box) at Millard Falls<br/>
* the interesting information learned about Pasadena from the clues to<br/>
Pasadena area boxes, such as the bridge designed by Greene &amp; Greene,<br/>
the location of the orginial Busch Gardens, the story of Tiburcio<br/>
Vasquez, and the former mansion used as Wayne Manor in the TV series<br/>
"Batman"<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a decent letterboxing trip, although I was disappointed at<br/>
 the number of boxes I either could not locate or were not there<br/>
according to the clues.  The area has so much potential; I hope<br/>
'boxing catches on a bit more there!<br/>
<br/>
All told in the eight days I was there, I nabbed only 23 boxes<br/>
(although I probably hunted close to 35), but not bad seeing as how<br/>
this was not a dedicated letterboxing trip.<br/>

  I'm new to letterboxing as I just discovered the phenomenon by a random  fate of google last week.  I'm greatful that you shared your  Southern California experiences, although I am a little embarrassed  that you've found 23 boxes, and in the same amount of  time my  husband and I haven't made it out on a single search so far.   :)  <br/>
<br/>
  I did get my Master Carve block for stamp making today!  And I'm  confident that we will go on our first letterboxing expidition this  weekend.  We had been planning on going to Switzer Falls but I  would rather go in search of one that Iwe're likely to have success  with.  Can you reccomend a box that might be good for beginners?<br/>

Hi Lost Lenore<br/>
Welcome to the addiction. Since you are new to letterboxing here are <br/>
a few sites that you can peruse and gain some insight to <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing.org:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html<br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug's site:<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/<br/>
Doug probably has the best info site on Hitchhikers and links to <br/>
regional chatlists.<br/>
<br/>
AtlasQuest:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/<br/>
Ryan has a link set up "Code of Conduct" that is really good for all<br/>
boxers to read<br/>
<br/>
newboxers' group:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
Where there is no dumb question, and is "the" place for many<br/>
newletterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
California Chat Lists<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbNCA<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxing-socal<br/>
<br/>
If you go back through the list that you tacked you post onto then <br/>
you will have a list in the Pasadena area of boxes that have their <br/>
status known most recently. The Suicide Bridge letterbox by Buzzard <br/>
is one that really doesn't require too much walking, and since most <br/>
everyone will be driving fairly fast by you it doesn't require much <br/>
stealth either. If you are planing other letterboxes in the SoCal <br/>
area then you might want to post your questions about local boxes <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>

letters on the post (per the clues) don't exist anymore, but the post<br/>

<br/>
There are some interesting boxes placed in Bronson Canyon, including<br/>
one that takes you through a cave.  I didn't have time to hunt these<br/>
boxes, but they sound intriguing.<br/>
<br/>
The Tiburcio Vasquez: The Repetto Ranch Raid Series - Soy Tiburcio box<br/>
was a great hike, although I did it in the waning hours of daylight,<br/>
which kind of made it spooky.  I think most of the boxes in the series<br/>
are missing, though, but this one is there.<br/>
<br/>
If you want a really great box at a great site, though, without a hike<br/>
or any strenuous activity, go for The Getty Center.  If you're quick<br/>
enough you might just find a little something from Massachusetts<br/>
inside.  But be discrete at this well-hidden, but patrolled area!\<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun,<br/>

Ahh, a box with some history. Make sure you read the clues correctly, <br/>
and don't assume they mean anything else. With the rainy season upon <br/>
SoCal the waterfall could be really pounding, and make creek jumping a <br/>
little dangerous.<br/>

The creek at Millard Falls is very easy to cross ... much more so than<br/>

A trekking pole or walking stick always helps!<br/>
