Club Day is coming up this Friday 4-cl and all day Saturday (4/25-4/26) at Eastern Mountain Sports.  All members of outdoor clubs receive 20% off everything in the store these days.  At the Woodbridge store, we will give the discount to letterboxers who bring in their book of finds (don't worry, we won't keep it).  Please note though, this is only at the Woodbridge Center Mall store.  I am part of the management team there, so you can feel free to call and ask for me if you have any questions.  This would also be a great time to pick up our box, since we can use the entertainment on such a busy day!  :)<br/>
