My vote is to include International boxes too, despite the website nominally<br/>
being for "North American" Letterboxes (or is that North American<br/>
Letterboxe*r*s?). As far as I can tell, the lbna website is the #1 site for<br/>

that the "global letterboxing" website has disappeared and the global<br/>

I don't think this is due to lack of interest in international boxes, just<br/>
that there isn't enough of them to warrant a separate development yet<br/>

I think if you're going to place a letterbox in some foreign country, it should be accesible to the people that live there.  Otherwise it really seems to me that we are just leaving garbage in other countries to indulge ourselves.  I'm pretty excited to hit up some of the central american boxes the next time I'm down that way.  but if I were to get there and see that there were no other stamps in it, I don't know if it's really worthwhile to leave a box someplace (generally in a park or something) if no one is going to get to it for years on end.   Also, providing the clues in the local language could better help explain what letterboxing is and cut down on the liklihood that the box will be removed.   This also opens the hobby up to people in those countries and reinforces the idea of Letterboxing North America, not Letterboxing USA/Canada anyway, when summer rolls around I'll probably just start translating and submit it unless there is definitely no space for it, or if anyone has any major objections to having a clues in Spanish for Spanish-speaking countries.Jim <br/>

available in the regional language. I'm a teacher so in the summer I have<br/>
free time.  I volunteered to (over the summer) translate the clues for boxes<br/>
in Spanish speaking countries.  I also figure that it couldn't hurt to put<br/>
some of the basic information pages in Spanish (the faq and the getting<br/>
started pages).  I could also translate these.   I feel very strongly that<br/>
the clues at least be made available in the native language otherwise it<br/>
just seems like squatting to me.   would there be any room on the site for<br/>
this? jim.<br/>

&gt; I'll add the old Mexico et al countries, and I'll toss an 'international'<br/>

&gt; That is, unless someone is vehemently against this.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not sure if you want to exclude International boxes, but the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rest should be included.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My vote is to include International boxes too, despite the website<br/>
nominally<br/>
&gt; being for "North American" Letterboxes (or is that North American<br/>
&gt; Letterboxe*r*s?). As far as I can tell, the lbna website is the #1 site<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; internet-based letterboxing (i.e., where clues are put on the net).<br/>
Witness<br/>
&gt; that the "global letterboxing" website has disappeared and the global<br/>
&gt; letterboxing yahoo group has not had any message traffic since December<br/>
02.<br/>
&gt; I don't think this is due to lack of interest in international boxes, just<br/>
&gt; that there isn't enough of them to warrant a separate development yet<br/>
&gt; (though I'm working on it!! :-).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm more than happy to volunteer my time to help set up and maintain an<br/>
&gt; international section.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>
