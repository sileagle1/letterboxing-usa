<p align="LEFT">       These two letterboxes are dedicated to the memory of Alain and May White, a brother and sister who founded the White Memorial Foundation in 1913.  The White preserve consists of 4,000 acres of varied terrain, with 35 miles of trails, a natural history museum, campgrounds, and water access.  The preserve is suitable for many activities, including hiking, mountain biking, cross-country skiing, horse-back riding, and kayaking.  We have found this area to be one of the most beautiful in the state and we are grateful to the Whites for having the foresight and generosity to have allowed future generations to be able to enjoy this land in its natural state.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Directions: </b>From the center of Litchfield, take route 63 south for approximetly three miles.  The parking area is on the left, immediately before the intersection with route 61.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Distance:  </b>Approximately 2.5 miles round trip.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Clues:  </b>Follow the wide white trail until you come to Teal Pond on your right.  From here take a left onto the yellow trail.  Stay to the left at the first two forks in the trail.  At the third fork, go right.  The trail will begin to go up hill and over many boulders.  Then look in the direction of your right shoulder.  You'll notice a large, overhanging rock face.  Alain's Letterbox is sheltered in this place. <br/>
       Continue on the yellow, going right at the fork, and then left at the second fork.  Follow the trail past Fawn Pond, on your right, taking a left at the next fork.  You just made a figure 8!  Arriving out on a wide, blue trail, take a right, or if you wish, take a short detour left, to get excellent views of the Plunge Pools.  Continuing on the blue trail, you will pass a large boulder, on your right, with a lovely inscription dedicated to the namesakes of these boxes.  At the next intersection, stay to the left, following the blue/white blazes.  You will come to a four trail intersection.  Taking a left on green, proceed downhill, reaching the Plunge Pools on your left.  Continue on the trail around the pond.  If you took the detour earlier, you will come to a point on the trail where if you look up and to your left, you will be able to see the stone wall - the lookout where you recently stood.  Keep going on the green trail, staying to the right.  After a distance, you will come to an intersection marked by a sign post.  Stay straight towards Beaver Pond.  In a little while, you will come to another trail crossing and will be facing Beaver Pond.  Go left and follow the trail to the pond's edge.  You will see a short stone column on the right.  Cross the trail at this point towards two jutting boulders beneath a pine.  Walk past this spot to another large, overhanging rock, beneath a mountain laurel.  May's Letterbox resides here.  To get back to you car, go back the way you came, staying straight, passing the green trail from which you just came on your right.  Stay to the right on the white trail and follow it all the way back to your car.<br/>
