                    <div class="plaintext-content">Folks, someone on the letterbox talk list is infected with the Klez <br/>
virus.  This someone would be using MS Outlook and have my email <br/>
address in their contact list.  Here's how I know:<br/>
I have been getting maybe 10 emails a day now for over a week that <br/>
look to be emails "returned" as undeilverable to the email I use for <br/>
the letterboxing talk list.  However, these are not emails I have <br/>
been sending out.  The way Klez works is it goes through the Outlook <br/>
contact list (I do not use Outlook), selects an email address, and <br/>
sends out a bunch of email copies of itself using that selected <br/>
address as a return address.  Lucky me, mine is one of the addresses <br/>
it has chosen.  So now, a bunch of people would be getting messages <br/>
that appear to be from me, but in reality, they are sent out from <br/>
the infected machine.  I have scanned my machine with several <br/>
leading anti-virus packages nine ways to sunday and I am clean, so I <br/>
know it is not me.  I urge you all to do a virus scan on your <br/>
computers and install a good anti-virus software.  You can do a free <br/>
scan of your machine from the McAfee web site: <br/>
http://us.mcafee.com/default.asp please let's get rid of this thing, <br/>
these emails flooding my inbox are driving me crazy!<br/>
