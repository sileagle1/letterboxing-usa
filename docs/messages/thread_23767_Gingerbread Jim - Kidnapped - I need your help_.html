The Adventures of Gingerbread Jim - Box #10 - Kidnapped<br/>
<br/>
At the age of 65, Gingerbread Jim at spent most of his years <br/>
wandering around the country, visiting people he knew and meeting <br/>
people he never met. Somewhere down the raod, he must have met <br/>
someone that didn't like him very much. Sent to me this weekend, was <br/>
a ransom note and what I thnk might be a clue to his where-abouts. <br/>
The ransom note states that Jim is safe, but if we ever want to see <br/>
him again, we need to send $40,000. The clue is a picture.<br/>
<br/>
To help find out where Gingerbread Jim is being kept, go to my blog <br/>
and look at the picture clues. http://teamnewhampshire.blogspot.com <br/>
They all have something in common. Not the location itself, but in <br/>
which town/city it is in. When you visit my blog to see the clues, <br/>
post your suggestions as to where you think he is, using the <br/>
comments at the bottom of each post. Only a few posted suggestions <br/>
will be used on the main messageboard to assist others in finding <br/>
Gingerbread Jim. The better the suggestions, the better the clues.<br/>
<br/>
There is only a month before something bad is to happen to <br/>
Gingerbread Jim. I don't know what it is, and I don't know if I want <br/>
to find out. Help Gingerbread Jim come home.<br/>

Your post says "look at the picture clues.  They all have something in<br/>
common......."  Yet all I see is one picture under clues... just a whale<br/>
doing a flip.... so where are the other pictures clueS?<br/>
<br/>
BTW.... if you aren't already aware... your blog can't be viewed in Mozilla.<br/>
What a horrible mess!  When I used Explorer though... Ah, much better!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Adventures of Gingerbread Jim - Box #10 - Kidnapped<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the age of 65, Gingerbread Jim at spent most of his years <br/>
&gt; wandering around the country, visiting people he knew and meeting <br/>
&gt; people he never met. Somewhere down the raod, he must have met <br/>
&gt; someone that didn't like him very much. Sent to me this weekend, <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; a ransom note and what I thnk might be a clue to his where-abouts. <br/>
&gt; The ransom note states that Jim is safe, but if we ever want to <br/>
see <br/>
&gt; him again, we need to send $40,000. The clue is a picture.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To help find out where Gingerbread Jim is being kept, go to my <br/>
blog <br/>
&gt; and look at the picture clues. <br/>
http://teamnewhampshire.blogspot.com <br/>
&gt; They all have something in common. Not the location itself, but in <br/>
&gt; which town/city it is in. When you visit my blog to see the clues, <br/>
&gt; post your suggestions as to where you think he is, using the <br/>
&gt; comments at the bottom of each post. Only a few posted suggestions <br/>
&gt; will be used on the main messageboard to assist others in finding <br/>
&gt; Gingerbread Jim. The better the suggestions, the better the clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is only a month before something bad is to happen to <br/>
&gt; Gingerbread Jim. I don't know what it is, and I don't know if I <br/>
want <br/>
&gt; to find out. Help Gingerbread Jim come home.<br/>

several days. His location , which looks very good to be in San <br/>
Diego, is about all any of us have for clues as far as to where he <br/>
actually is.<br/>
<br/>
But..... putting this whole kdnapping thing in all seriousness, I <br/>
had looked for some help from someone out on the west coast. This <br/>
person I found, was more than willing to help me out so I can play <br/>
this little game with everyone here in the letterboxing community. <br/>
As of right now, it has seemed to backfired. It has now been 2 weeks <br/>
since I sent Jim out to the west coast to be planted. Jim seems to <br/>
be actually be kidnapped now. But was it by the person I asked <br/>
assistance from. This person claims to not have recieved the package <br/>
of which Jim was to be in.<br/>
<br/>
Please bare with me. All I wanted to do was play a little game with <br/>
everyone, and it seems to have gone terribly wrong. May the peron <br/>
that has Jim be brought to justice.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  Ok so here is the deal. I have not heard from the kidnapper now for<br/>
  several days. His location , which looks very good to be in San<br/>
  Diego, is about all any of us have for clues as far as to where he<br/>
  actually is.<br/>
<br/>
  But..... putting this whole kdnapping thing in all seriousness, I<br/>
  had looked for some help from someone out on the west coast. This<br/>
  person I found, was more than willing to help me out so I can play<br/>
  this little game with everyone here in the letterboxing community.<br/>
  As of right now, it has seemed to backfired. It has now been 2 weeks<br/>
  since I sent Jim out to the west coast to be planted. Jim seems to<br/>
  be actually be kidnapped now. But was it by the person I asked<br/>
  assistance from. This person claims to not have recieved the package<br/>
  of which Jim was to be in.<br/>
<br/>
  Please bare with me. All I wanted to do was play a little game with<br/>
  everyone, and it seems to have gone terribly wrong. May the peron<br/>
  that has Jim be brought to justice.<br/>
