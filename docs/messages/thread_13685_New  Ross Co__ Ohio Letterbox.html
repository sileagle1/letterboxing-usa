Ross County, Ohio. Placed by Salamander on 6-16-03. **Please bring <br/>
pen and stamp pad.  CLUES: This letterbox can be found in <br/>
Chillicothe's Grandview Cemetery. You will start at the gazebo. <br/>
Standing at the southeast side of the center post, take a reading of <br/>
127 degrees and go 64 paces at that heading. You should find yourself <br/>
standing in front of a reddish-orange man-made object. From here, <br/>
take a reading of 202 degrees. 34 paces at that heading will bring <br/>
you to a large Maple tree. The letterbox is hidden behind a rock in a <br/>
hollow at the bottom of the north side of the tree. Enjoy the view <br/>
during your visit! NOTE: Depending on the time of your visit, these <br/>
clues may bring you into close proximity to groundskeeping staff. <br/>
(Generally Mon-Fri. daytime hours).I have found that they are very <br/>
friendly, but I have never discussed letterboxing with them, so the <br/>
usual discretion is advised. And of course, please be respectful of <br/>
those resting here. Thanks!<br/>
