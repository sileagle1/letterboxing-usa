                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently we have had several of our letterboxes go missing. Some that have been active since Jan. 2001. We also have found that on a few letterboxes that we have found the letterbox hasn't been properly covered and in one case left out in the open. Please try to remember to rehide it better than you found it. If it is a city box or in other populated areas - USE DISCRETION ! If there are other folks around wait until the coast is clear or come back at another time. Don't spoil the hunt for some one else.<br/>
