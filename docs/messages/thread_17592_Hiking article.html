<br/>
If you notice, the article never says "experienced", just well <br/>
prepared. <br/>
<br/>
The author and family were a little too well prepared for one thing <br/>
but not prepared for other things, IMHO. They were well prepared for <br/>
the cold, but not the possibility of overheating. Even after half a <br/>
mile you can become overheated and may need to take off a layer or <br/>
two off (yes, even in cold temps). The kids wouldn't have been able <br/>
to do this with full snow suits on. <br/>
<br/>
I witnessed a very similar situation on the Appalachian Trail this <br/>
summer, where the outcome was VERY different from this family's <br/>
ordeal. In this case, the person was ignored until it was too late <br/>
to help the person.  One of the saddest days of my six month trip.<br/>
<br/>
Exhaustion, dehydration, and heat stroke are very serious <br/>
situations. In EVERYBODY, one of the first signs is irritability <br/>
(but not just the only one). Especially with kids as they might not <br/>
be to tell you exactly what is going on. Don't ignore these littles <br/>
signs. It just could, and in this case of the article did, save <br/>
someones life.<br/>
<br/>
How "experinced" a person is is only something they can decide. I <br/>
would hope that even people who just do short day hikes would know <br/>
first aide. I couldn't believe the amount of people I ended up <br/>
helping this summer who parked their car just to hike up to the <br/>
nearest overlook/monument/whatever that ended up needing some kind <br/>
of first aide care that they were not prepared for. Several times <br/>
this summer, I helped to get people out of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
In short, I'm just saying be prepared for the trail that you are <br/>
hiking and pay attention to the little signs that might indicate a <br/>
problem. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the link Phyto. I read the article ... and speaking as a <br/>
nurse, the first thing I thought was, "Geez oh pizza ... didn't <br/>
anyone check to make sure that child wasn't over-heating?!"<br/>
<br/>
Anyway ... what's over is over, and fortunately all's well that ends <br/>
well, in this case.<br/>
<br/>
I also took advantage of the opportunity to look at the photographs <br/>
and to listen what the children thought of the hike (by clicking on <br/>
the links to the right of the article).  That was interesting.<br/>
<br/>
BTW ... I found out waaaay more than I need to know about the author <br/>
of this article. (Bowing to another thread re: search engines ... <br/>
but surfing the net is how I found out about letterboxing! I don't <br/>
watch TV but I don't consider myself morally superior.. I waste my <br/>
time online. LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Not only is WENDY ALMEIDA a content producer for the Outdoors <br/>
section at MaineToday dot com but this is not the first time she's <br/>
used a family hiking event for one of her articles.  Here is another:<br/>
http://outdoors.mainetoday.com/hiking/almeida030713.shtml<br/>
(The little cutie-pie holding the "magic feather is the very same <br/>
child who "got sick" on the hike in the latest issue; referenced by <br/>
Phyto.)<br/>
<br/>
Is there a point to this message? No. It's 4am where I live, and I'm <br/>
awake.  (grin) If I were more clever, I would find a way to tie this <br/>
all together, I'm sure.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
