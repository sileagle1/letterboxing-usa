summit in search of the Mt. Tabor Letterbox.  I found it after much<br/>
fussing with my compass and tromping around in poison oak.  (scratch<br/>
scratch scratch). The hallow of the tree is a scary place to put your<br/>
hand into. <br/>
<br/>
It is certainly different searching for a urban letterbox versus one<br/>
out in the woods.  People watch you with interest.  "What the hell is<br/>
that man doing down there?"  "I think he is making some drug drop off".<br/>
 I think that it would be excellent to be able to hide a dozen boxes on<br/>
Mount Tabor.  It is so accessible and would be a good way to have a<br/>
mini-Dartmouth (Dartmore?) here in Portland.<br/>
<br/>
After I found the box I sat watching the sunset over Portland and felt<br/>
very accomplished.  Thanks, Mitch.  This Saturday there is jazz concert<br/>
on top of Powell Butte, near the site of the Powell Butte letter box. <br/>
So that is the one I'll search for next.      <br/>
<br/>
Cara and I have procrastinated placing the oxbow boxes for nearly a<br/>
month but hopefully we can get to it this weekend.  (our self imposed<br/>
deadline for wedding invites is this weekend).  So definately after<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Kevin<br/>
