We're not too far away from the date of the Ohio gathering!<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE LET ME KNOW (OFF LIST) IF YOU WILL BE ATTENDING<br/>
***Note***I'll send the detailed directions to the meeting spot (&amp; any<br/>
updates) to only those who say they are attending, so that the list is not<br/>
'clogged'.<br/>
 DogScouts@hotmail.com<br/>
<br/>
When: Sunday June 15th.<br/>
Time: I'll be there very early to reserve us a spot<br/>
Where: Just West of Cincinnati in Miami Whitewater Forest.<br/>
    (Let me know if you need directions)<br/>
Who: All are invited! (Dogs and 2 legged kids too)<br/>
Cost: There is a $1 day fee or $3 yearly fee for the park pass<br/>
What to bring: Yourself, friends/family, your letterboxing gear, log books<br/>
(past &amp; present), bug spray, drinks (no alcohol allowed in the park), food<br/>
for yourself or to share.<br/>
Event Stamp: I've carved an event stamp, but if anyone else would like to<br/>
carve one also, feel free! The more the merrier!<br/>
<br/>
This will be a laid back gathering. No set schedule. We hope to meet, eat<br/>
and do exchanges before noon and then spend the afternoon letterboxing.<br/>
There are several boxes already placed within walking distance of the picnic<br/>
area I plan to nab and more a short drive away (within the park). The Sith<br/>
Impossible game will be the day before &amp; there is camping available in the<br/>
park (call (513) 367-9632 for reservations). If you plan to camp- definitely<br/>
get reservations because there is a big dog show going on in the park that<br/>
day too &amp; the camp ground could fill up. There are 46 sites with 30amp elec.<br/>
If anyone has any talents they would like to share (log book making,<br/>
carving, stamp protector making <franz hint="">, etc.) Let me know.<br/>
I hope to see you there!<br/>
