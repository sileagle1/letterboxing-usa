<div>Just returned to CT from a trip down to DC. Hit the "Toe Path" 
Letterbox in NJ and happy to report it's in fine shape. Added my own box along 
the canal and will send in new clues later. While in DC, we hid a box along the 
Mount Vernon Trail and were able to find "Runway" and "Knowhadamean Fern", but 
not the "Riverside Park" box. The "K. Fern" box may need some clue updating, as 
there is a brand new boardwalk near the end of the trail that confuses the clues 
a bit. We also found "Clark's Crossing" in Vienna, VA while visiting my old 
neighborhood of 30 years ago. It's in good shape. We hid two more Letterboxes in 
the DC area, but it may take a bit to get all 4 new box clues sent in. I wish we 
had more time to hit the other boxes in the area, but the humidity killed 
us!</div>
