change-purse and I'm a few decades older than you.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to hide a box late this evening on the Naperville Riverwalk here in <br/>
IL.  The Naperville area is kind of famous for it's abundance of bunny <br/>
rabbits, mostly much to the consternation of area homeowners who have to research <br/>
everything they want to plant to find out if it's something 'bbits like to eat <br/>
or not.  <br/>
<br/>
Along with the first finder certificate, I'm putting a prize of the little <br/>
bunny change purse in honor of Naperville's bunnies, and I'm hoping some local <br/>
live bunnies will "feel" she's in there, take pity on her, and hang around her <br/>
til someone finds the box and takes her home.  <br/>
<br/>
I know it's a "she" because she's pink.  I was going to put one pink bunny <br/>
and one blue bunny in the box but then I thought, no, not a good idea, the area <br/>
has enough bunnies already, y 'know?<br/>

<br/>
I was touched by your story.  I've only planted 1 box and it was a special moment for me.  I did not carve the stamp, but the whole process took a lot of time and planning - writing the clues and actually taking pictures of the process.  (Also traveling over 4,000 miles to do it!)  I know the pleasure I get from finding a letterbox that someone took the time and effort to share with others.  I hope others would get the same excitment from mine.  <br/>
<br/>
You awoke the little child in you.  My suggestion for future boxes would be to start carving stamps of inanimate objects.  That way you won't feel bad when you leave them all alone.  : )     <br/>
