&gt; letterboxing.  Anyone see it??  My friend is going to send it to <br/>
me.  If<br/>
&gt; it's any good should I scan and post it in the files or something???<br/>
<br/>
Betsy Freeman of the Omaha World-Herald asked me for an <br/>
interview to do an article on Letterboxing but we never <br/>
could get in touch with each other.  She was able to<br/>
talk with Scott Redd and Funhog though, and here is the<br/>
article:<br/>

<br/>
My Lone Star HH does get mentioned in the article as<br/>
the Red, White &amp; Blue State Of Texas, probably because<br/>
it made its way up to Nebraska last year.  Maybe the<br/>
article will generate interest in the Mid-West.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's amazing where a conversation on an airplane can lead. My <br/>
letterboxing addiction led to a conversation with my neighbor in row <br/>
9 and that led to a friend of hers who is a writer at the Omaha <br/>
paper. Knowing that Scott Redd has been waiting patiently for over <br/>
two years for letterboxing to take off in his fair city, I figured <br/>
that this might be just the thing to encourage others along the banks <br/>
of the Missouri to start hiding boxes. <br/>
<br/>
My usual hesitation to encourage print articles was cast aside on <br/>
this occassion. If ayone goes to NE, please consider it a random act <br/>
of letterboxing kindness to leave a box in your wake for Scott and <br/>
all the new initiates we hope to see in the area. Many thanks to <br/>
Betsie Freeman for the article. Funhog<br/>
