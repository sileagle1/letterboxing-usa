first park we've encountered with tons of dogs (and their owners) but none of <br/>
the droppings (probably because of the big sign and the stock of baggies at <br/>
the entrance. We had no problems following the clues and suspect the box is <br/>
hidden under the frozen earth, although if there's anyone out there who has <br/>
found this box, we'd appreciate a hint about how far and which side of the <br/>
trail the tree with the 'v' is :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was out at J.B. Williams Memorial Park in Glastonbury a couple of Sundays <br/>
ago and encountered the very same difficulty. Following the clues was pretty <br/>
straightforward, but there's absolutely no telltale sign as to where the <br/>
"tree with the V" is located. Annie, I agree with your assessment that the <br/>
box must be hidden well beneath the snow. I must have poked around in the <br/>
general area of the box for a good twenty minutes and came up empty, too. <br/>
I'll try again when the ground is visible (which, given all the snow we just <br/>
got, will probably be May or June!).<br/>
