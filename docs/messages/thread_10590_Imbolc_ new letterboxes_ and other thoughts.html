Greets to those who put candles in their windows last night, or otherwise<br/>
are celebrating Imbolc (or its successor "groundhog day" if we need to <br/>
be PC) in their own ways ... may the sun be reborn soon ...<br/>

One way to handle tragedy is to put rubber in the woods, so we did some of <br/>
that today -- mapsurfer #75 (http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box75.html)<br/>
(there is more info in this message than on the above url):<br/>

The Library is sort of like the Mad Hatter's Hitchhiker<br/>
Hostel, except, of course, clues are stored there.  Bring <br/>
your cuckoos, WoMs, and bonuses and make an exchange.  You can<br/>
stamp in like a normal letterbox, but please don't remove a clue<br/>
unless you leave one.<br/>
<br/>
(There is a odd bonus for the first visitor -- something I<br/>
found out there that seemed appropriate in the Library.  Feel<br/>
free to take this).<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you are the first to identify the capital building<br/>
represented by the stamp, you get some sort of prize (along the<br/>
lines of you get to ask questions about my clues, but it will<br/>
be better than my standard 3 yes/no.  (Its a long story, but<br/>
circumstance prevented using the stamp in the location I wanted<br/>
to, and I needed a library, and I had a useless building stamp,<br/>
so here we are ...)<br/>

I don't have any other thoughts after all.  Do you? :-)<br/>

It's like a radio you can't switch off...It's a gift that soon turns <br/>
