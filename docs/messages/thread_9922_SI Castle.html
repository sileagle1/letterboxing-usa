I know that F=Found, P=placed and HH=hitch hiker but what does the X <br/>
and T stand for? <br/>
<br/>
Also, Hitch Hikers ....  Do they just show up anywhere?  I read the <br/>
page but tend to be a wee bit dense, so I was still unclear if they <br/>
only appeared in new boxes or any boxes.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your patience ...<br/>

&gt; &gt;I know the X stands for exchange (You get these by meeting other <br/>
boxers either on the trail or at a gathering or really just anywhere <br/>
you meet and exchange stamps.)I'm not sure of the T. (Some people <br/>
like to make up Stats for fun or funny things they have found or seen <br/>
on there quests. This maybe the case here.)As for Hitch Hikers they <br/>
come in both varieties they can either be placed with a new box by <br/>
the placer or be put into anothers box that already exists. I think <br/>
the main thing here is that there really are no rules. You play the <br/>
game the way you decide. I'd like to welcome you and hope you enjoy <br/>
this as much as we do.<br/>
