                    <div class="plaintext-content">  The Great Seal Letterbox is located in the Great Seal State Park <br/>
near Chillicothe, Ohio in Ross County.It was placed on 8-20 -02 by <br/>
Salamander. CLUES: Take the Marietta Road entrance to the Ireland <br/>
Picnic Area. Find the southeast corner of the Ireland Picnic <br/>
Shelter.From here take a reading of 135 degrees and walk 25 paces (1 <br/>
pace=2 steps) to the edge of the woods. You should see a small stump <br/>
immediately to your left. From this stump, go 11 paces at 150 degrees <br/>
to a large maple tree. If you look behind the tree, you will find <br/>
that the bottom of the trunk is hollow. Here you will find the <br/>
letterbox. NOTE: this microbox does not have a stamp pad.  <br/>
DIFFICULTY: EASY.<br/>
