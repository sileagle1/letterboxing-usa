<br/>
My son Peter and I decided to head out yesterday to look for the <br/>
Valcour Island letterboxes. We were on the road by 9, caught the  <br/>
Grande Isle ferry to Plattsburg, and were paddling across fairly calm <br/>
waters by 12.<br/>
<br/>
We decided to hike over first to the east side of the island and look <br/>
for the Sloop Cove box. As we arrived at the cove, a Great Blue <br/>
Heron flew in and alit on the sand. We took this for a favorable omen <br/>
and pressed on, and indeed 15 minutes later we had found the stone <br/>
arch fireplace, the foundation ruins, and the sentinel cedar, and <br/>
were stamping up. Such a beautiful spot, such a beautiful stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Our luck did not hold, however, back on the west side. At 3 pm we had <br/>
still not found the Arnold's Gambit LB, and had to head for home. We <br/>
arrived a few minutes before supper - just in time for a paternal <br/>
glass of whiskey to honor the day.<br/>
<br/>
My sympathies. Thom. I am sure we will both try again.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
<br/>
Tom<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I would say that the Canadians are likely to win the next <br/>
skirmish. They have quite a flotilla hidden in Butterfly Bay!<br/>

a 9.5 hour round trip taking the girls and friend to GS camp in <br/>
absolutely-middle-of-nowhere Wisconsin. The setting was<br/>
beautiful, though.... when I left they had already gotten the girls<br/>
in their suits for a dip in the lake and a canoe-tip test.<br/>

<br/>
	We are so glad that you were able to find "Sloop Cove" box - the<br/>
setting is magnificant, isn't it?  Thank sfor the compliment on the<br/>
stamp - BTW, I carved the lettering, on a wave-tossed sailboat.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
	Sorry, and concerned, that you could not find "Arnold's Gambit"  - it<br/>
is a two-sided stamp; maybe you saw it in Susan's book last fall? <br/>
<br/>
See you soon I hope<br/>
Erik<br/>
