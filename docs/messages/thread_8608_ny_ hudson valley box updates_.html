York's Hudson Valley this weekend, and to check up on a box I placed <br/>
last August.<br/>
<br/>
We are pleased to report that Kancamagusdabull's Boxin' On The Hudson <br/>
boxes -- all three of them -- are intact and in place.  Although I <br/>
grew up in Woodstock and spent a fair amount of time in Kingston, I <br/>
had never been to Hasbrouck Park, and so had never seen that <br/>
particular view of the Hudson.  It was a gorgeous day and the view <br/>
was specatcular!<br/>
<br/>
We also took the opportunity to check on a box I placed last year.  I <br/>
hadn't heard a peep about my Kaaterskill Falls box since placing it <br/>
on 20010810, so I was prepared with a newly-carved stamp and <br/>
outfitted box when we visited yesterday.  Would the original box be <br/>
gone?  Or would it still be there, undiscovered by anyone?  I <br/>
couldn't wait to find out.<br/>
<br/>
Climbing the trail, which had been improved even more since I was <br/>
last there, I spotted something on the ground.  "That doesn't belong <br/>
there," I said to Rustypuff, and I dutifully picked up a discarded <br/>
(unused and unopened) feminine product and placed it in my backpack.<br/>
<br/>
We climbed a little further and were soon in sight of a large flat <br/>
rock lying on the left side of the trail.  I can remember stopping <br/>
there for snacks on hikes past.  There was something on the rock, and <br/>
from a distance it looked like an empty potato chip bag -- more of <br/>
someone else's trash for us to pack out.  On closer inspection it <br/>
turned out to be something else entirely -- my Kaaterskill Falls <br/>
letterbox!  Just sitting there, inside a ziplock bag, right out in <br/>
the open!<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the box everything was present and accounted for, if a bit <br/>
damp.  And what's more, the log was filled with entries, mostly from <br/>
non-letterboxers who left their names and comments, but also from a <br/>
few letterboxers with their own stamps.<br/>
<br/>
According to the dated entries, the box was first found on 20020418, <br/>
eight months after it had been placed.  After that there are a flurry <br/>
of entries throughout the summer, which makes me think it was not <br/>
rehidden carefully by casual hikers.  The greatest number of entries <br/>
are from 20021020, the day before our visit, which makes me think the <br/>
box had been sitting out in the open at least that long.  Hikers from <br/>
as far away as the Netherlands and Wales signed in.  Some stamped <br/>
their fingerprints, other stamped with leaves they had found nearby.  <br/>
A couple of folks left haiku.<br/>
<br/>
This is the first time I've been able to recover a log from a box I <br/>
placed.  Can you tell I'm tickled?<br/>
<br/>
We're amazed that the box was sitting there waiting for us.  We're <br/>
incredulous that no-one messed with it and that it seems to have been <br/>
treated with respect -- no-one wrote any rude messages inside or <br/>
scattered the contents to the four winds.  And we're puzzled and <br/>
fascinated, wondering how it came to be where it was, wondering how <br/>
long it had been there, why it took so long to be found the first <br/>
time, and why it was apparently so easily found afterward.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we took the box and continued on up to the falls.  There we <br/>
consolidated the old box and the replacement box I had brought -- <br/>
original stamp, new ink pad, new log -- and returned the letterbox to <br/>
its original hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
The clues have not changed and can still be accessed at: <br/>

This hobby just gets cooler all the time!<br/>
