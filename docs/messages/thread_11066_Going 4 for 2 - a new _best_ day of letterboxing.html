<br/>
The subject line is not a typo - we went armed with the clues for two boxes (and found them.)  In the second box was a clue for a "bonus" box in the area.  The bonus box also contained a hitchhiker!<br/>
<br/>
I should box with my mom and her friend more often - they are good luck!   This is the first HH we've ever found.<br/>
<br/>
The Spider Hitchhiker is in my posession now, and will find a new place to spin it's web soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone else had great weather and good luck too,<br/>
