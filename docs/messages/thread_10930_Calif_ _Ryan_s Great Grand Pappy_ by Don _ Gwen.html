<div>California-Placed 2/18/03, nearest city:  
Barstow in San Bernardino County</div>
<div>Clue &amp; terrain difficulty:  
easy</div>
<div>Best time to visit: any time when it is 
coolish</div>
<div>Babes in strollers OK but no dogs.</div>
<div>Directions:  From Barstow, Ca drive north on 
I-15 to the Ghost Town Road for some western atmosphere.  Park in the lot 
after paying about $6.00 for entry and walk to almost the end of the town, 
stopping on Main Street near the Mystery Shack.  On your left across from 
the Mystery Shack note the path between the mining car and a lamp post.  
Walk around the hill until you are able to see just</div>
<div>the top shingled cupola and white spire of the 
school house. Now, line the spire up between the second "C" and the "O". The box is hidden along this line from 
where you are standing.  Continue down the 
path 7 big guy paces, then turn up the embankment 
from the path 9 paces to the line of sight previously noted.  The black 
cylinder is under a small reddish rocky overhang and under and behind some 
moveable rocks.  Be discrete when hunting for the box.  Try for a 
mid week or first thing in the morning to avoid crowds.   After 
you have found the box go have a Root Beer and check out the rock store and 
other attractions. If you don't want to eat lunch here try Peggy Sue's Diner for 
movie buffs. It is pure Corn.  The Diner is on the same off ramp but across 
the freeway.</div></body></html>
