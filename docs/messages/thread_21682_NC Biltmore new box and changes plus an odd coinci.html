<br/>
I have rearranged the clue pages so that the boxes are "clumped" together <br/>
based on where you park your vehicle - most of them (except Cornelia) <br/>
involve a bit of hiking.<br/>
<br/>
I met Llama Mama while she was stamping up at Cornelia, and we hiked <br/>
together to Nos. 3, 4, and 5.  3 and 4 were in place, but I spotted 5 (Toe <br/>
Cooler) high and dry up on a creek bank a couple of hundred yards downstream <br/>
of where it was supposed to be.  The stamp was missing (even though the lid <br/>
was still on!), but the log book was there - damp, but there.  And the last <br/>
people who stamped in before the September '04 floods were Llama Mama's <br/>
daughter and son-in-law!<br/>
<br/>
Look for more new boxes later this spring!<br/>
