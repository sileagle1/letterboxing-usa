    My mystery box, A Maryland Winner, has retired from being a <br/>
mystery. He says he has the urge to run so I am setting him free<br/>
tomorrow at Riverbend. <br/>
    I chose to do this now, for two reasons. The first (spoiler here)<br/>
is that we are moving and I don't think the new family would <br/>
appreciate strangers on their property. The real reason, I'm too lazy <br/>
to carve a new HH.<br/>
    So it's happy trails to the MD Winner.<br/>
