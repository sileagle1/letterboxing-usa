and to have the placement date as May 24th.  This is fine, however, <br/>
does anyone remember what happened the last time we tried this?????<br/>
<br/>
Let me jog your memory.  November 2004.  Hartford County Connecticut.  <br/>
We had a gathering to commemorate the boxes we planted for the winter.  <br/>
We all put our boxes on LBNA that weekend.  We put so many boxes on the <br/>
site that it CRASHED the site for days!<br/>
<br/>
Have the webmasters thought this through yet?  Since I know nothing <br/>
about website management, can something be done to help ease the huge <br/>
influx of boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents....<br/>
