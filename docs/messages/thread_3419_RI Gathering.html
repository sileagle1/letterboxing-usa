<div>Thanks to all for the warm fire, friendly 
atmosphere and some fabulous boxing. Allison especially liked the touch don't 
look box. I liked meeting max (box). Too bad we got there so late. We were bound 
to miss a few of you. I do have some fantastic sunset pictures and I would post 
to the list, but I'll wait for the proper method from the webmasters for that.

<div>Once more, thanks so much, Trish &amp; Fred, for 
organizing this great event. I really enjoyed meeting so many new letterboxers. 
The rain Saturday afternoon  provided proper Dartmoorish atmosphere, and 
the remainder of the week-end was pure New England gold.</div>

Trish and friends for a great gathering day. The Cowboy and I had <br/>
such a great time meeting, greeting and exchanging. The cowboy <br/>
scattered herds of cattle large and small across logbooks much to his <br/>
delight. Rain - What rain? We had so much fun we really didn't care. <br/>
Nabbed the backpacker hitchhiker that day. Did all the boxes at the <br/>
event and tracked down Max's Monumental Mystery that day too. Our <br/>
counts are way up now and we thank Trish for taking the time to <br/>
coordinate everything. Thanks to Wanda and Pete for taking home  my <br/>
box, I left before  the close of the day since we left early for a 4-<br/>
H banquet . It was great to meet you all . See you on the trail.  <br/>
