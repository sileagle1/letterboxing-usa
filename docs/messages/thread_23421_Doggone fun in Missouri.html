<br/>
Jim the Wonder Dog<br/>
http://midmoletterboxing.blogspot.com/2005/09/dog-days-and-letterboxing-in-m<br/>
arshall.html<br/>
<br/>
There was a time when Jim was the most famous dog in America.  He could<br/>
predict horse races, count, remember odd facts and bake wedding cakes.<br/>
Well, maybe not the latter, but he was one smart pooch and appeared in all<br/>
the magazines of his time.<br/>
<br/>
When he died, the people of Marshall, MO gave him a full funeral.  He was<br/>
not only buried in style, but Marshall set up a memorial park right off the<br/>
town square.  The park is right across from a combination ice cream<br/>
parlor/towing service. Great place.<br/>
<br/>
The kicker on this box is that it has been in place for eight months without<br/>
being found.  I guess it is a bit off the beaten track  but well worth it.<br/>
The stamp is a piece of art (no brag, just a talented wife).<br/>
<br/>
While you are in the area, find Waverly Apple Festival, a carved-on-the-spot<br/>
stamp planted by our friends, The Byrds.<br/>

look for it there.<br/>

If it doesn't work, copy and paste it but make sure you go clear to<br/>

It is also on LBNA at:<br/>

Again, make sure the link goes clear to "Dog."<br/>

Good luck!  I hope you enjoy both Jim and the box.  We also have a<br/>
number of boxes in Columbia that can be found during a quick stop-over.<br/>
