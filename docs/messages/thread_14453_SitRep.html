don't think we reported on. All fine, unless noted otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
Late May, 2003<br/>
<br/>
Sister Road, Sister Box [Microbox  not much room left to stamp in]<br/>
<br/>
June 2003<br/>
Birdhouse Letterbox, Needham MA [a treasure - especially for kids and <br/>
kids at heart]<br/>
<br/>
Serenity II, Sharon, Ma [found easily even though we later realized <br/>
we were hiding a landmark with our own big feet!]<br/>
<br/>
Castle of Love, Gloucester, MA [though not required to find the box, <br/>
I recommend a visit to the castle museum if either you love the <br/>
medieval period or would enjoy fantasizing about living in a castle. <br/>
They give you pretty free rein to wander and dream as you wish.]<br/>
<br/>
Bull Frog Pond, Rockport, MA  [Pretty little park with swings] <br/>
<br/>
Shooting Star, Rockport, MA [We love Halibut State Park.]<br/>
<br/>
In one of the 3 above boxes, we left the Wandering Walrus hitchhiker.<br/>
<br/>
July 2003<br/>
<br/>
Into the Future, Time Travels Series, Milton, MA [Blue Hills]<br/>
<br/>
Time Traveler's Return, Time Travels Series, Milton, MA [Blue Hills  <br/>
we didn't find a right turn between the Battle of Hastings and the <br/>
first Main intersection, but found the way anyway. Using the "gone to <br/>
far" landmark provided in the clues is a good idea on this one  <br/>
there are a lot of dead trees once you start taking notice!]<br/>
