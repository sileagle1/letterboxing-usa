                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, all.  I posted to the list last week, searching for the owners of the <br/>
Bradley Woods box.  I did not get a response, but perhaps the owners are not <br/>
subbed to the list right now.<br/>
<br/>
The box is in need of repair.  I was there last week and found the journal <br/>
with no problem.  Alas, the box and the stamp are gone.  All that is left is <br/>
the lid to the box, and a rain-soaked journal in a plastic bag.  The previous <br/>
visitor that logged in on 4-19 reported that the box contents were strewn on <br/>
the ground, and the stamp could not be located.  They did, however, find the <br/>
hitchhiker stamp and took it to keep it on its journey.  <br/>
<br/>
Mom had an extra plastic bag with her, so we double-bagged the journal.  I'm <br/>
concerned that more damage will occur to the journal.  The metal spiral rings <br/>
were already starting to rust.  All of the images stamped by prior visitors <br/>
who used dye-based ink were simply washed off of the journal pages.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I'm not from the Cleveland area, so I couldn't do anything <br/>
more to protect the journal.<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping Margie and Mike are subbed to the list right now and see this <br/>
message, or someone on the list knows how to contact them.  If not, perhaps <br/>
some kind soul in the Cleveland area would be willing to perform a little bit <br/>
of LB first aid!  Or, if you know you're going to visit the box, perhaps you <br/>
could take some repair supplies along with you.<br/>
<br/>
Hate to see a box in distress!  <br/>
<br/>
Have a good weekend,<br/>
