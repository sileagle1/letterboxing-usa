<strong>Mother Hubbard Letterboxes (3)</strong></div>
<div><strong>                             
Hubbard Sanctuary, Chaplin CT</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong>                                                  
<strong>Windham County </strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Stamps Created and Planted by Bonnie (age 10) of 
the Bonnie and Clyde Gang</div>
<div>Planted January 26, 2002.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Old Mother Hubbard went to her 
cupboard</div>
<div>To get her Poor Dog a bone, </div>
<div>But when she got there, </div>
<div>The cupboard was bare,</div>
<div>And so the Poor Dog had none.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So Mother Hubbard went looking for a bone for 
her Poor Dog.  From Rt.6 out of Windham, she drove North on Rt. 198 til she 
came to the Chaplin Town Offices on her left.  She pulled into the parking 
lot and parked there.  From behind the town offices she walked to the 
right, back to Rt 198, around the fence, between the pond and the fence, 
following the yellow blazes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She walked along, with the pond on her left, and 
then a field on her right.  When she came to a T at the end of the pond, 
she took a right between two stonewalls.  From the Hubbard Sanctuary sign, 
she walked 27 paces (left foot only) on the trail. </div>
<div>She stopped, looked left at the large stone in 
the stone wall, and found the <strong>Mother Hubbard </strong>letterbox. No 
bones there!      She continued on the trail, now a 
wide wood road, with a wooded drumlin hill on her left and the field on her 
right.  She came to another Darling Pond, and entered an area of tall red 
pine.  She stopped to watch a deer cross her path and continued.  
After the pond, she stopped and took another woods path to the right.  Had 
she continued straight, she would have found herself in the State forest.  
But she took the right, and soon the pond came into view again.  As soon as 
she saw the pond, and before a slight hill down, she looked behind an old log 
lying parallel to the trail on her right.  Lo, and behold, she found her 
<strong>Poor Dog </strong>in a box!  Now to find the bone!  On her way 
she went, stopping only in amazement at a large fallen tree over the path, 
fallen not by man but by beast.  Amazing!   She explored along 
the pond at other fallen trees.  Such handiwork! </div>
<div>Back to the woods path 
heading East, she continued til she came to the ball field.  Turning left 
at the ball field she walked by a mound of dirt.  Just behind the dirt she 
spotted a large double trunked tree where those beasts had been working.  
Behind the tree under a rock, she at last found her poor dog a bone, in the 
<strong>Milk-Bone letterbox</strong>.  She tried to be really secret 
because there were people about.  After hiding the box, she continued 
across the park and ball field back to her car.</div>
