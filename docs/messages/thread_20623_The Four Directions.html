I'd like to just clear something up: I have nothing against the exchange of<br/>
stamp images. Andy &amp; I had written back &amp; forth and agreed to exchange<br/>
stamps and I was thrilled!<br/>
<br/>
We are relatively new boxers, so what I was questioning was whether it's<br/>
appropriate for one person to send all of the images carved for the Four<br/>
Directions gathering to someone else?<br/>
<br/>
I would have been more comfortable if the organizers had wanted to send Andy<br/>
the entire series - in fact, I think that would have been cool.<br/>
<br/>
But the other part was that my son was feeling pretty proud of his carving<br/>
(thanks to very kind words from Koyote!) and had wanted to send the Caddo<br/>
stamp image to Andy along with our own personal stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow I would be uncomfortable sending copies of other folks' stamp<br/>
images, but that's just my own personal feeling, and I'm very open to<br/>
learning the etiquette of the sport from the greybeards!<br/>
