&gt; ...what to do when you run out of ink on the trail...<br/>
<br/>
If your pen has run out of ink, you might try using a stick; I've been<br/>
able to write something with a softish twig.  Sometimes a rock will<br/>
work; talc or soapstone are especially good, but sandstone or<br/>
limestone might do it.  Most metamorphics (schist, gneiss, etc) are<br/>
often too hard.  Now if you meant that your inkpad is dry, well,<br/>
that's just sad :-(  You should always check your inkpad before<br/>
leaving on a boxing trek.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ...what happens if you spill water on your page of clues when you <br/>
&gt; are three miles into a good hike... <br/>
<br/>
Keep on hiking, of course!  A letterbox is just a letterbox, but a<br/>
good hike is exercise and fresh air and a chance to commune with<br/>
Nature and all them good things :-)  The letterbox might be the reason<br/>
for choosing that particular trail, but it shouldn't be the only<br/>
reason for being in The Great Outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ...how to handle a large spider that has conveniently craw[l]ed into<br/>
&gt; your napsack and doesn't want to come back out<br/>
<br/>
Ask it, politely, to vacate the premises.  If it objects, you might<br/>
try leaving the bag outside overnight.  Or you could try to get it to<br/>
move by gently prodding it with a stick or piece of paper.  Spiders<br/>
are our friends; they consume a lot of insects, including flies which<br/>
harbor all sorts of diseases; we should never kill spiders<br/>
out-of-hand.  Certainly, they can get into places where we don't want<br/>
them, but it is rare to have to eliminate them.  I always leave a few<br/>
daddy-long-legs (the West Coast variety, not the Southeastern<br/>
monsters) in the house when I clean the corners; they do a nice job of<br/>
keeping the bugs out :-)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

This has happened to me and I now put my clues in a sheet protector before I go out. I can throw it on the ground - even in snow. No more running ink for me. <br/>

If all you're lacking is a writing instrument, a sharp stick dipped <br/>
