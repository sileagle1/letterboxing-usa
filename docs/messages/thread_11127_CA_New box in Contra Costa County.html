<ul>
<li>Interstate 680 N to Ygnacio Valley Rd. exit.  Turn right on Ygnacio Valley Rd., about 5 miles.
</li><li>Turn right on Clayton Rd., this turns into Marsh Creek in about 2.5 miles.
</li><li>Turn right on Regency Dr. There is a stop light here.
</li><li>Take Regency all the way to the end and park.  This is an entrance to Mt. Diablo State Park.
</li><li>Trail entrance is on right side (facing downhill).
</li><li>Turn left at gravel 'T' - Park gate is ahead (no fee)
</li><li>This trail will follow Donner Creek the entire way, so if you don't see or hear it (except in the hieght of summer) then you've take a wrong turn.
</li><li>Take the middle trail <u>Cardinet Oaks Road</u> bear left at the fork, remember keep the creek on your left.  
</li><li>The box is almost exactly 1 mile from your starting point at the park gate.
</li><li>Stay or <u>Cardinet Oaks Road </u>until you come to a post that says <u>Donner Cabin site</u>, go left on single track.
</li><li>There is a cement rubble pile on your right, half way down trail, climb to the top and sit on the top one facing the creek, the cabin site is behind you (and under you).
</li><li>The letterbox is located under the cement ledge, in front of you, on your right.
</li><li>If you go over the wooden foot bridge, you've gone to far.</li></ul>
<div>This is a beautiful hike in the spring when the creek is running full and the wildflowers are in bloom.  In the heat of the summer you may encounter rattlesnakes (they won't both you if you don't bother them) and see tarantulas.  Lots of tree varieties here, too.</div>

Woo hoo - another Bay Area box!  I hear that there was an article in the Contra Costa times recently and that may account for some of the new folks around here.<br/>
<br/>
Linda - will there be 3 more clues to follow in this series?  Are they all at the same site, or are they around Contra Costa County?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for planting these - I may have some time to get out there tomorrow<br/>
