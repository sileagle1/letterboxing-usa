Good morning my fellow Letterboxers. Today continues the adventures of Team Rayvenhaus as they attempt to reach that illusive #100!<br/>
<br/>
Getting the family up early was the easy part. Getting them going on the other hand......  Given that fact that I had not yet had coffee, I am quite pleased with myself, both in my ability to deal with children who couldn't figure out just what was so important, and preparing for the first excursion of the newest addition to the team, Sorcha, a 3 month old, yellow Labrador Retriever.  <br/>
<br/>
Off we went, everything packed and the entire family in the car, to find Deep Sink and The 'Weasel' which were wonderful stamps in a very, very beautiful area.  Both of them were in place and were in excellent condition!  Thanks for #57 and #58.<br/>
<br/>
Then off we go in search of Dash Point and the 'Campfire' and 'Beach Box' stamps.  With the dog in tow, who has barely worn a collar let alone a leash, I was prepared for the worst scenario imaginable.  However, other than deciding she's not to happy when other dogs approach her master, she did better than the RayvenKids for the most part.  (grin)  She handled the area beautifully, proving that, once she's seen it and done it once with RayvenDad or RayvenMom guiding her, she can over come anything. Logs, stairs, tunnels, people, other dogs, the Sound, seaweed, streams, etc, etc, etc, etc.  Both boxes are in place and are in excellent condition.  Thanks for #59 and #60!<br/>
<br/>
Then we decide to tackle the Trial-n-Error boxes there.  The climb was 7734 but we made it and so did the dog, though she had NO idea just why her master was climbing this silly trail!!!  We discovered Dash Point #1 safe and sound and unvisited for almost a year to date.  We felt kinda special being the first ones in 11 months to have come across it and stamped in.  Thanks for #61!<br/>
<br/>
Then off we went, looking for #62, Dash Point #2, however, Trial and Error being what it is, we errored and will have another trial another day!  We jumped the gun too soon and entered at the wrong place and by the time we were done climbing the poor puppy was sleeping on her feet as she traversed the trail.  Deciding to get everyone off to dinner, we went back to the car and went to a restaurant with an outdoor eating area where we were able to have our puppy join us for dinner. All in all, a wonderful day of Letterboxing with the family, reminding me why we do this hobby/sport/whatever it's called. For the sheer enjoyment and the beauty of nature.  Certainly puts the gripes and complaints here on the mailing lists in their perspective, at least to me and RayvenMom.<br/>
