                    <div class="plaintext-content">I prefer not to do boxing in the snow.  As you said, it leaves <br/>
footprints that some not so nice people can follow to do not so nice <br/>
things to the box.  Of course there are those people who could not <br/>
follow footprints in the snow to find anything.  The next snowfall <br/>
will also cover over any tracks, so that will limit the time the <br/>
footprints are visable.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is that the snow covers up most boxes.  Last winter <br/>
was very snowy in New England.  Most of our boxes here are planted <br/>
close to the ground, and were below the snowpack level.  I had to <br/>
give up searching for some boxes even when I thought I was in the <br/>
right place.  I spent the winter reading clues and taking walks in <br/>
my imagination, and then went out boxing when spring came.<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This will be my first winter letterboxing.  So I don't have any <br/>
experience letterboxing when there is snow on the ground.  But, I <br/>
was wondering how others handle it when their footprints leave an <br/>
obvious path to where the letterbox is hidden?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A side note, we planted our first letterbox last week.  The <br/>
torture of not knowing if it was visited yet and if it was, what <br/>
they thought of it, and if they were bit by a squirrel, or if they <br/>
thought it was a stupid spot, or a stupid stamp... is tortureous but <br/>
enjoyable. ;)<br/>

If snow prevents you from letterboxing you can always take<br/>
a trip down south.  Here in Texas we finally have a decent<br/>
amount of boxes to find and winter is a great time to visit.<br/>
