                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received an e-mail message this morning from a woman who was <br/>
hunting some of my letterboxes at Muskegon State Park (West <br/>
Michigan).  She indicated that the park ranger had alerted her to the <br/>
letterboxes and gave her copies of the clues, thinking it would be a <br/>
fun activity for her and her grandson, who is spending Spring Break <br/>
with her.<br/>
<br/>
Here I thought I was being so sneaky, not sure how the park staff <br/>
would feel about the boxes being placed there, and come to find out <br/>
the park ranger is passing out the clues!<br/>

I don't think it would have occurred to me to plant without telling<br/>
the Park Rangers.  I'd rather be told No, then have people looking <br/>
for a box that's been removed by the park rangers.<br/>
<br/>
The other question that occurs to me, is how much does the ranger<br/>
know about letterboxing?  I have this vision of the ranger telling<br/>
visitors it's 'kinda like a treasure hunt' and them people who <br/>
haven't letterboxed before find it (with clues from the park) and<br/>
figure 'We found it first, so we get to keep it!'<br/>
