<br/>
Lighthouse Keeper here, my partner One Love Journeying and I made a trip out<br/>
to Colorado in January... and of course did our share of boxing. As far as I<br/>
know there are 3 stamps in Garden of the Gods, "Quilted Tree" "Siamese<br/>
Twins" and "Garden of the Gods Park".... it's a great place to place a box!<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>
<br/>
Also, seeing that you will be in Red Rocks, might I suggest checking out One<br/>
Love Journeying's box, "Box Heads Visit the Rockies," this is a series of<br/>
hers that she places all across the country, it's pretty cute! Also, the box<br/>
is a drive by so quite easy to pick up. Have a great trip!<br/>
<br/>

The Red Rock area is stupendous, have a great time.  Can't say the ones I found would still be there, but they were in the area as far as I remember.<br/>
