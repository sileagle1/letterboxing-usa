Nice carvings too!  <br/>
<br/>
I found Chauncey Peak, Timber and Nosebreaker this afternoon in a snow <br/>
and ice covered challenging climb. Though I was careful to take a <br/>
roundabout approach to the boxes as possible - light falling snow<br/>
and winds promised that any footprints would be quickly covered.<br/>
<br/>
My faithful canine companion was a willing partner and made the steep<br/>
climb up to chauncey peak more easily than I!  <br/>
<br/>
This was outing number two for me, and man am I ever hooked!<br/>
Anyone considering a couple of hours in Central Connecticut should check <br/>
out these boxes!  Nicely done!<br/>
