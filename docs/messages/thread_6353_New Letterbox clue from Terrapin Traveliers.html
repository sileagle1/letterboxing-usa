Loggerhead Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Location: Boca Raton, FL--Palm Beach county<br/>
Date of Placement:  7/20/02<br/>

You are looking for a Nature Center named for a tree that is known for its <br/>
distinctive peeling bark (some call it the "tourist tree").  When you find <br/>
the place,  you can begin your quest.  Turn into the driveway and park off <br/>
to the right.  Make a donation and pick up a trail map at the main building. <br/>
  Take time to look at some of the displays and exhibits--beware of the king <br/>
snake!  The Boardwalk Trail is a nice walk, however what you seek is on the <br/>
North Trail.  Follow the yellow butterflies out of the nature center --it <br/>
will lead you to the butterfly garden.  Take time to enjoy the multitude of <br/>
flowers, and butterflies.  As you continue along, stay to the left.  You <br/>
will pass bee boxes and Alice's bench on your left.  Continuing ahead, you <br/>
will come upon a seating area with eight long benches in a clearing.  In the <br/>
northeast corner of this area you will see a cabbage palm (sabal palmetto) <br/>
to the left of some Australian pine trees.  At the base of this palm, you <br/>
will find what you seek.  Approach from the left side.  The box is covered <br/>
well under pine needles and a flat stone.  Beware of critters when reaching <br/>
into dark places.  Be discrete!  Use the nearby benches to sit down and <br/>
stamp.  Please replace the box exactly where you found it, well hidden, and <br/>
under the flat stone.  We hope that you enjoy your visit.  Please adhere to <br/>
the "leave no trace" policy.<br/>
<br/>

area to be searched, to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to <br/>
conduct oneself safely and responsibly with respect to those conditions and <br/>
with respect to his or her personal abilities and limitations. "Letterboxing <br/>
North America" and the individual letterbox sponsors assume no liability for <br/>
events which may occur related directly or indirectly to one's searching for <br/>
a letterbox.<br/>
