I had a question on how people do and count exchanges.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally have a moral issue doing an exchange for someone that I <br/>
don't get something in return for.  For example, stamping into an <br/>
Absentee book at a gathering.  I actually won't do it and some people <br/>
get a little bent about it.  I also tend to not do an exchange unless <br/>
the person has a stamp to do an exchange with as well Just seems to <br/>
me that is what and exchange counts as.<br/>
<br/>
But my question comes in when you have changed your signature stamp.  <br/>
I just changed mine here recently for example.  So do people get to <br/>
count my new image as a second exchange if they already had my <br/>
signature stamp before?  If so do they also have to give me a second <br/>
exchange in return?  Or does my signature stamp only count once no <br/>
matter how many times I change it?<br/>
<br/>
Interested in hearing how others handle this sort of situation.<br/>
<br/>
I bid you all well,<br/>

I personally, realizing that I am a newbie to this hobby and by no means an expert or even, not counting my age, an old-timer, count a new stamp as a new stamp.  It's my opinion that we are meeting a person and exchanging stamps.  Therefore, when someone gets a new signature stamp and then attends an event, I get a new stamp in my logbook. And, as such, I get another number added to my exchange count.  However, use this calculation at your own risk, your mileage may vary, do not fold, spindle or mutilate.<br/>

  Greetings Everyone - <br/>
<br/>
  I had a question on how people do and count exchanges.  <br/>

  don't get something in return for.  For example, stamping into an <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">IMHO, even if someone has a new signature stamp, you can still only <br/>
exchange with that person once. I would still get the new image, but <br/>
only count it once (like I did recently when Team Green Dragon got a <br/>
lovely new image for their signature stamp and I met them for the second <br/>
time at my second gathering).<br/>
Then again, you're talking to someone who doesn't really keep track of <br/>
the numbers all that much since I don't know what to count half the <br/>
stuff as since everyone has different methods of counting. I say do <br/>
whatever you feel like! Undoubtedly, everyone will tell you something <br/>
different!<br/>
