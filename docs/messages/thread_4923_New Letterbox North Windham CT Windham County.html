<p>Location: North Windham Connecticut, Windham County</p>
<p>Rated: Easy</p><b>
</b><p>Driving down route 6 from Willimantic, Wal-Mart, or the Windham 
Airport, take a right onto route 203. Very quickly you will see on the right a 
sign for the Joshua's Trust Property the Windham Atlantic White Cedar Bog . You 
may park here or across the street. This is the famous Air Line Railroad bed. 
Follow the line Northeast. You will pass a metal gate. As you walk along you 
will go over a sturdy wooden bridge. You will soon see rock ledge on the right 
of the rail road bed. When you near the end of the rock ledge, you will see two 
twin pines growing from one trunk. Standing in front of that tree, you must take 
a bearing of 130 degrees. Depending on the time of year you can look between the 
two trees up on top of the rock ledge and see a couple boulders on the hill. 
That is your target. You will have to go to the end of the ledge and go up the 
hill to this point. Finding the two boulders which are very close together, 
notice that one has a long man made drill mark. To the left of that mark, move 
two much smaller rocks and find the letterbox. It is between the two 
boulders.</p></div></body></html>
