haven't been to look for letterboxes in nearly two years... so your <br/>
boxes are safe.<br/>
<br/>
    BUT... mine must be soggy! :)  My very first box (created <br/>
without having ever seen an actual letterbox) was in a pencil box <br/>
inside of a ziplock bag.  Nothing inside was bagged.  Needless to <br/>
say, it met its death in the wild. <br/>
<br/>
    I have gotten better, I think.  I've learned to test containers <br/>
in the kitchen sink.  I've learned to bag everything in the box.  <br/>
But... I still bag separately.  <br/>
<br/>
    So, if any of you go looking for Quiet Place Letterboxes... <br/>
PLEASE assist me and take along an extra bag.  The newer ones should <br/>
be fine, but the older ones may need some sunlight. :( And give me <br/>
feedback on the conditions so I can learn from it.  <br/>
<br/>
    All of the suggestions here have helped greatly.  Thanks for <br/>
this input!  I may get it right next time. :)<br/>
