                    <div class="plaintext-content">Exciting news from Texas!  I had postcards in all 4 of the letterboxes I<br/>
put out for the Duck Creek series--and when boxes #1, #3 #4 went missing I<br/>
figured they were just part of the loss.  (Actually, I found some of the<br/>
cards from box #3--whoever had found it had strewn some of the the<br/>
contents, torn pages from the book, and left the postcards to become<br/>
waterlogged).  But #1 and #4 disappeared without a trace!  Yesterday one of<br/>
the postcards from box #4 turned up in my mailbox!  Here's what it says:<br/>
<br/>
"I found your letterbox on 6-28-99.  This was the first time I heard of a<br/>
letterbox.  I think I put it about the same place I found it but it looked<br/>
as if it may have washed away.  Georgia"<br/>
<br/>
I'm very excited to know the box is out there, but now I want to know WHERE<br/>
so I can have accurate clues.  I'm thinking I'll leave notices for Georgia<br/>
posted on the trees? No return address, so no way to contact her easily....<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas, letterboxers???<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Julie<br/>
