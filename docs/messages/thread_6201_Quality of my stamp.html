I've really been enjoying finding all of these fun letterboxes, and <br/>
always enjoy seeing people's great stamps!<br/>
<br/>
I am getting ready to place my first box, and have been working on my <br/>
stamp carving. I'll be honest, my carving skills leave much to be <br/>
desired, and I think my stamps look very crude next to some of the <br/>
great art I have seen.<br/>
<br/>
My question is: will people be disappointed if they find my box and <br/>
the stamp is very simplistic? Should I get one carved for me? I'd <br/>
much rather have the stamp be of my own crafting --- I just wish I <br/>
were better at carving!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

I have never been disappointed in any stamp I've<br/>
found. I think letterboxing is the whole experience<br/>
and the fact that a person took some of their own<br/>
time, energy and expense to create something for me to<br/>
find is just a mind boggling thing! Giving of yourself<br/>
like that for someone else's pleasure in finding it is<br/>
just a really terrific thing, isn't it? :o)<br/>
<br/>
  I  hope people don't get disappointed by mine,<br/>
either, as I'm surely no artist and sometimes that<br/>
darned blade slips.<ouch>  I use a lot of clip art or<br/>
easy images I can concoct for my stamps.  If anyone is<br/>
disappointed I haven't heard from them yet!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

IMO, you have put your heart and creativity into your first carving attempt.  Be proud of what you have created!  I, too, have just placed my first box recently.  The stamp was my second attempt at carving, the first attempt being my own signature stamp.  So, any boxes I visit will always be marked with my newbie carving effort!  <br/>
<br/>
I'll be glad to seek out your box once it's planted.  Judging by your e-mail addy, looks like it will be local for me!<br/>
Have a great weekend,<br/>

&gt; I think my 8 month old could carve better than I but it doesn't stop<br/>
&gt; me from planting 'boxes.  If you've carved your own stamp there's a<br/>
&gt; personal gratification in having done it,  Besides, every time you<br/>
&gt; carve one you just get better at it.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, while I'm out searching it's not the quality of the stamp<br/>
&gt; that I find but the hunt that's so addictive!<br/>
&gt; I can't remember where on the list I read it but..."If you plant it,<br/>
&gt; they will come!"<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Happy 'Boxing!<br/>

Hunting for a box and the hike to it is the main thing for me. When I find a box, I don't care if the carving is bad. Getting the stamp is the end of the hunt not the hunt itself. Who knows, you may become very good at it with practice and time anyway. Good luck. Chuck &amp; Molly in CT

If I was looking for your letterbox, I would want it to have all the parts to <br/>
it that  you prefer best.  Its your box, so its your presentation.  I'd like <br/>
your stamp no matter what it looked like!  <br/>

 I've really been enjoying finding all of these fun letterboxes, and <br/>

 I am getting ready to place my first box, and have been working on my <br/>
 stamp carving. I'll be honest, my carving skills leave much to be <br/>

 great art I have seen.<br/>
