&gt; I am traveling to Miami on monday and I have a box ready to be planted.<br/>
&gt; There are none for me to find in the area,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
Not quite NONE.   There are two on Key Biscayne!   And if you have time to <br/>
come farther north, we have several in the Fort Lauderdale area.   Mine seem to <br/>
be disappearing fast, but there are still some here!<br/>
<br/>
And   I always try to do any necessary maintainence when I see a need in a <br/>
box I find.   So plant away!<br/>
