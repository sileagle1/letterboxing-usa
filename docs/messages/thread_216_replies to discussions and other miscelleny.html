                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have been out of the country for a few days and have just<br/>
sifted through all of my letterboxing e-mail.  Some <br/>
(rather long winded) comments:<br/>
<br/>
First of all, welcome to the new subscribers :-)<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, hooray for the trend in "cryptic" clues...<br/>
<br/>
On the point of national/local, my personal preference is<br/>
for a more national view.  I guess what I am trying to say<br/>
is that it is cool to develop locally, but I would hope clues<br/>
always percolate up to a national forum.  My fear is that<br/>
letterboxing develops locally and then evolves in isolation<br/>
from the national perspective, meaning that there is a cache<br/>
of cool letterboxes in a particular area, and we don't know <br/>
about them because the national perspective has atrophied.  I<br/>
realise the legitimate counter to this view, but, well, thats<br/>
my opinion :-)  I'm the sort of person that could make hunting<br/>
letterboxes in North Dakota a vacation, and am also the sort <br/>
of person who could hide a box without stating the country it <br/>
is in in a straightforward way.  I guess that is why I have <br/>
that view.  Know what I mean, sorta ... ?<br/>
<br/>
As for hosting mailing lists, I am still willing to do that under<br/>
the pros and cons stated previously.  I can also provide web-based<br/>
archives, digest, and a mailing list for each state if people want<br/>
that.  Like Mitch, I have no vested interest in doing this one way<br/>
or the other, except to say that I would not change unless there are<br/>
compelling reasons to do so.  (It may be that managing 50 lists<br/>
via egroups is a pain; I dunno.  I do know its easy with majordomo,<br/>
which is what I would use).<br/>
<br/>
E-mail to me while I was on vacation may have bounced, and the<br/>
letterboxing.org url may have not been working.  These problems<br/>
have been fixed.  If you sent me private e-mail and I ignored<br/>
it, it was most likely that it got lost.  I will try to respond to<br/>
those mails (from Dan :-)) later this week.<br/>
<br/>
As for biographical info being listed on the web under each state,<br/>
I'm not so sure I'm keen on this idea.  Not that I'm anti-social or<br/>
anything, it just doesn't seem to fit.  Somehow it takes some of the<br/>
mystique out of it.  Also, it would never be complete or up to date,<br/>
and would be a pain in the @$$ for someone to maintain.  Perhaps I<br/>
missed the gist of this thread.  (In any case, I'm 33, write software<br/>
that manages IP networks, and  mapsurfing is my hobby).<br/>
<br/>
As for publicity, I think we have zeroed in on the right attitude.<br/>
BTW, I received inquiries from the blurb in DVOA's newsletter I <br/>
mentioned a couple of weeks ago, so careful targeting of orienteering <br/>
folks may stir up interest.  (but note that letterboxing and competitive<br/>
orienteering are alot more different than people may realise, so such<br/>
targeting should be aware of this.  If anyone is interested in doing<br/>
a publicity piece, ala the smithsonian article, O/NA is the magazine <br/>
read by most orienteers in the US, AFAIK, circ around 2000.  I can <br/>
provide contact info from the masthead if anyone wants it.  I have <br/>
been told that it will cease publication in July.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, and this is mainly to Dan, I do believe it is feasible to have<br/>
forms backend processing on my server, and the output placed on Dan's<br/>
server.  In other words, we could implement Dan's forms.  How do people<br/>
want this to work exactly?  One thing I would enforce is that only<br/>
members of the group could post clues, but beyond that, have little <br/>
to add, and quite honestly, would rather actually letterbox than do <br/>
this, but if people feel this is a priority, it can be done.<br/>
