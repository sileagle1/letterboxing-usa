<div align="center"><strong>A Series of Four 
Letterboxes</strong></div>
<h3 align="center">Upton State Forest</h3>
<p align="center">Westboro Rd., Upton, 
Massachusetts</p>
<p align="left">These boxes were placed by the lonemasswolf, YIMS, and Holly on 
the 20th day of April in the year 2002 .<br/></p>
<h3>Park Information</h3>
<p>This 2,600 acre forest offers multiple trail uses including 
hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding. Hunting is permitted in 
season.</p>
<h3>Park Directions</h3>
<p>Mass Pike west to Rte.I 495 south (Upton exit 21B) right off 
ramp, go straight 3.5 miles and take right onto Westboro Rd. Forest is 2 miles 
on the right.</p>
<p>For best results get a map at the information board next to 
the parking lot.</p>
<p>This search should take between 3 and 4 hours. It 
can be said to be a moderate hike, about 10 miles with occasional climbing. 
There are 4 letterboxes to this series.</p>
<p>This Letterbox Series is dedicated to two special ladies, 
Joyce and Holly, who have been friends for fifty years.</p>
<p>Once you have parked, head back toward the park entrance. 
Once at the gate, you will see the beginnings of the Rabbit Run Trail across the 
street. Look for a short boardwalk. Follow the Rabbit Run Trail, crossing two 
more streets before entering deeper into the forest. Loop back south, then east, 
and then again north. After a while heading north, you will see a small stand of 
white birch on the right side of the trail with a stone wall off to the left of 
the trail. Just after passing this stand, scramble over to the far side of the 
wall. Position yourself facing the trail, and locate a small tree (not a birch) 
with three blue slashes off to your right. Face that tree. The first letterbox 
lies at the base of the tree right behind you. Stamp in, leave your note, and 
rehide the box well. </p>
<p>Continue along the Rabbit Run Trail, recrossing two of the 
three streets, traveling along the Old Hopkinton Spring Trail for a while, and 
finally recrossing the third street. You are now on the Mammoth Rock Trail. As 
you follow this trail to Mammoth Rock (and it truly is a mammoth rock), you will 
come to an area where the trail makes a sharp descent to the right. Just before 
this descent, on the right side of the trail there is a very large boulder 
balanced on the ridge. The second letterbox lies beneath the southern end of 
a medium sized boulder next to the balanced one. Take care stamping in 
as this may be a busy spot.</p>
<p>Proceed to the Mammoth Rock and take a little time to marvel 
at its size. Continue along the Mammoth Rock trail, passing the Grouse Trail, 
until you reach the Loop Road. Turn left and follow the Loop Road to Dean 
Pond. Just north of Dean Pond there is a jumble of rocks filling 
the pine grove located in the apex formed by the Loop Road and the 
Dean Pond Road. Somewhere among these rocks is a large one with a small pine 
tree growing out of its top. From the west side of this rock, step 
off eight paces, approximately twenty-five feet, due west. The third 
letterbox lies under a large flat rock that is mostly covered with pine 
needles. Once again, stamp in and carefully rehide the box.</p>
<p>Now, go back up the Loop Road until you come upon the 
Whistling Cave Trail on your left. Take this trail to the Whistling Cave. (more 
like a whistling boulder in the middle of the trail). This area of the forest 
will be very rocky with a plethora of various sized boulders. Leaving the 
whistling cave, continue along the trail to the very next blue trail marker on a 
tree to your right. Five paces along the trail after this marker, you will see 
two trees that were once one leaning on a boulder on a bearing of 20 degrees 
from where you stand. The final (and the best) letterbox lies at the base of 
these trees behind some logs and leaves. Leave your mark, hide the box, return 
to the path, turn right and continue on.</p>
<p>You will cross a swamp, finding your own way, as the trail 
was totally flooded in April 2002. From here on the markings become faint 
splashes of paint. Never fear, just stay on the trail. You will soon come to a 
steep climb. At the top, the trail ends at the Park Road. Turn right and 
follow the road back to the parking lot.</p>
<p>Please let us know about your adventures finding these 
treasures.</p>

<br/>
You guys!  Thanks so much for planting this series in my "backyard".  <br/>
I look forward to tackling this series in the next few weeks or so.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I have been passing you in the night for so long.  I've <br/>
either found your letterboxes (I live in Narragansett RI in the <br/>
summer, and I after having found your original Point Judith <br/>
Lighthouse letterbox and then it went missing, I must have gone up <br/>
there scouring the rocks below nearly every week!) or you have found <br/>
mine (I do a fairly regular "care and feeding" of my boxes) or we <br/>
have all found someone else's box!<br/>
<br/>
Next time you are in this area, send an email.  Maybe we can find <br/>
WaldenRun's Piece of Cake together.  It has eluded me on five <br/>
attempts!  My low vision status may be a contributing factor there ...<br/>
<br/>
Pinpointed the general location of Massachusetts Wolf Mystery based <br/>
on a trail map from another letterbox and actually found the <br/>
entrance.  Gotta get back there to search it out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the letterboxing fun!<br/>
