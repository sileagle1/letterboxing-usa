Box Name: Eight is Enough at Merrow Meadow<br/>
Placed: 5/21/2001<br/>
Location:  CT, Windam County, Storrs, Merrow Park, Rt. 32<br/>
Special Note: Wheel chair accessible<br/>
<br/>
At Merrow Meadow you will find<br/>
A 8irthday letterbox of the very 8est kind.<br/>
It's accessible to those who travel in chairs<br/>
and is a most pleasant stroll alone or in pairs.<br/>
At the start of your journey there is the # 1.<br/>
The pathe is smooth, so here you can run.<br/>
Count on the numbers until you reach 6<br/>
You'll have to take gravel, your wheels they may stick(s).<br/>
At the first of two 8ridges look around carefully,<br/>
Food for 8aby dragons you may luck out to see.<br/>
8etween 8ridges there's a 8ench for a rest,<br/>
Enjoying a quiet moment by the river is the 8est.<br/>
Continue on, 8ut stop 8 meters from 1 before 9<br/>
Turn around &amp; remember a most funny line.<br/>
