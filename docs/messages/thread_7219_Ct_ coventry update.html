</p><p>Hearty congrats on finding your 100th letterbox! You and your family and 4H kids have made so many wonderful contributions to letterboxing here in CT and beyond, I think I can speak for many of us who also salute you! How appropriate that your 100th was a smiley face. Bet you smiled right back!
