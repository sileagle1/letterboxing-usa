we were certain that Mormon Lumber Road was gone given the rather cheep box<br/>
it was in - but this was my first free moment to post a reply.<br/>
<br/>
I got your email, Buzzard, and I'll contact you directly about getting it<br/>
back. I would love to have it be an event stamp (after it makes the rounds<br/>
of some 4-H events as the kids are already planning displays around the<br/>
stamp's experience), though I have no clue how to designate and distribute a<br/>
stamp for that purpose, so guidance in that area would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
We are still planning a trip up to the area as soon as we know we can get to<br/>
the locations and I'll make sure we take along extra memory cards for the<br/>
digital camera and then post the photos on the club's boxing site.<br/>
