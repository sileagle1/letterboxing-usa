                    <html><body>Wow - I moved to NoVA from SoCal and I never thought of coyotes here!  There if you let your dog or cat out you just suppose they're coyote food and that's the way things are.  I carried an air horn, pepper spray and a leather whip on hikes for them and cougar.  Usually the horn was plenty or I'd crack the whip in the air and they were out of there. Good for bear, too.  I observed that feral dogs were a lot more dangerous to humans that coyote. </body></html>
