Clueless:<br/>
Park at the Mariemont Library.   Collect your clues and exit the west <br/>
side of the library.  To find the clues for this letterbox, you must <br/>
go to the Mariemont library and do some research.  Some of it can be <br/>
done on the Internet if you wish, but there is at least one of the <br/>
clues that you must go to the library to find.  Therefore, I am <br/>
providing the library web site so you can find their hours of <br/>
operation depending on the season.  <br/>
