going down the trail.You will then go down a small embankment and cross<br/>
over a small stream bed,then you will cross over a little gully and go<br/>
up a small embankment.Continue on you you will pass a couple of giant<br/>
pine trees on your left and a stream on your right.Keep going and you<br/>
will be going through a grove of mountain laurel twisting and turning<br/>
stepping over logs.you will come to a spot where you have to go down<br/>
another small embankment close to the river then you step up and<br/>
continue on the trail.you will be going through more mountain laurel and<br/>

ground.Under the dead branches and some sticks is your Letterbox Please<br/>
