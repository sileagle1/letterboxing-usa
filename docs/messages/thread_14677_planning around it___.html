  Well, you are all right. Last night, my boyfriend was looking at some letterboxes on the website. What you should know about us is that we like to go on day trips when we have a mutual day off, usually down to the Cape or up to NH or VT. So, as he is looking at the boxes, he remarks that he wants to go find the Strong Bad one in particular (we are huge fans - he has actually put the first 50 on DVD for a DVD production class). What do we say next, but "let's go on a day trip up to North Conway and get the box while we're there!"<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, we just began to plan one of our summer day trips around a letterbox. :)<br/>

Come ON!!! There's a STRONG BAD box?  I'm so jealous!  You New Englanders have all the fun!  *grin*  What about Bubs?  Is there a box for him?  If not, I'm shamelessly stealing the idea (and image) for a Michigan box.  *drool*<br/>
