                    <div class="plaintext-content">Honestly, I have yet to figure out all the hubbub on this, either - nor<br/>
the need for the database.  Let me explain.  <br/>
<br/>
Wes and the other web-masters spent a great deal of time redesigning<br/>
the LBNA website so that box placers could go in and update their own<br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
In my mind (which may or may not be in the majority), it only seem<br/>
logical that if you decide to place a box, you are taking<br/>
responsibility for that box - to maintain it and keep an eye on it, or<br/>
at least enlist the help of others (should you place one on vacation,<br/>
need to move, or any other in a long list of reasons) to do so.  If you<br/>
don't, than it would seem all you are really doing is littering.<br/>
<br/>
Hand-in-hand with that, you should also be responsible for making sure<br/>
your clues are up to date and that contact info (current email) is also<br/>
accurate in your clue listings.  If you are no longer in a position to<br/>
do that, then again, enlist the help of other letterboxes to help you -<br/>
my observation is that this is an overly helpful group and someone is<br/>
always willing to lend a hand.<br/>
<br/>
Now, given the above, it only sensibly stands to reason the following: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Seekers should be courteous enough to drop the placer (or list) and<br/>
email, saying the box is fine (especially if no one has logged in for a<br/>
bit), it needs some TLC, it needed some work and I helped out, I wasn't<br/>
able to find it, etc, etc, etc.  Especially if there is a concern with<br/>
the box, it would be nice for the seeker to send an email (or cc what<br/>
they send to the list) to the placer, since many placers may not read<br/>
the list on a regular basis or simply miss a reference to their box<br/>
within the message traffic.<br/>
<br/>
So, now that the seeker has helped out, it is then only courteous for<br/>
the placer to respond by updating the clues with a quick note at the<br/>
top.  Note that it has been reported missing but not yet confirmed, or<br/>
yes, it is missing and will not be replaced or whatever is appropriate.<br/>
 If you are unable to go yourself to confirm if a box is missing or<br/>
not, again - letterboxers are a helpful clan.  Ask someone that has<br/>
previously found it if they would be willing to run out and check to<br/>
confirm the status.  If the note from the seeker was simpily to say<br/>
that the box was found and in good order, then this also allows the<br/>
placer to decide for themselves if they would like to include that info<br/>
at the top of their clue or not.<br/>
<br/>
So now, if you are a boxer who prefers to not attempt to seek out boxes<br/>
that may not be there, just double check the clues before you go to see<br/>
if any notes have been added.  This also allows individual placers to<br/>
make decisions about how much info is listed on their box.  If they<br/>
chose to update clues periodically with a note that says, box was<br/>
checked or found on xxx date and all was good, they can from the info<br/>
seekers have provided them.   <br/>
<br/>
I have been involved with this hobby for 2 years now, and this is how I<br/>
have always perceived that the "system" should work.  In fact, it<br/>
always seem to be exactly how the system has worked - and worked well. <br/>
It has now been made easier with the addition of the new capacities of<br/>
the website - so we no longer need to wait for our VOLUNTEER webmasters<br/>
to have the time to update info.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe another piece that can be added (and maybe it is, I haven't<br/>
posted clues in a while) is for there to be a box to check that sends<br/>
out a message to the announce list indicating that a boxes info has<br/>
been updated, and that would automatically state updated in the<br/>
beginning of the subject line.  Others can advise if that is possible<br/>
based on how the current structure is designed.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned that letterboxes are a very personal thing to the placer<br/>
 - and there a gazillion variations on the theme.  The only one that<br/>
truly knows the intent and secrets of that box (and what is and isn't a<br/>
spoiler is some cases) is the placer.  Hence, it is only reasonable<br/>
that the placer retain control over status messages, clues and the<br/>
like.  At the same time, this also requires that placers understand the<br/>
need for maintaining the treasures they release for us all to enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing everyone!<br/>
