<div>    Hi</div>
<div>    I'm dying to know how you carved the 
lettering in your stamps at Lake Compounce.  Is that just an Exacto 
knife?  I'm so impressed!  My attempts have been somewhat less 
successful.  Can you enlighten me?  Many thanks.  Ann 
T.</div></body></html>

the art part, but the lettering is a bust for me using either the Speedball<br/>

up...tell us the secrets of your skill, please!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got through carving a duplicate of a Pokemon card for a swap I <br/>
am in. It is the exact size of a card (2.5 x 3.5) and contains all <br/>
but the smallest words on the card. The carved words are pretty <br/>
legible, too!<br/>
<br/>
This is the first I've done such teeny words (14 point), and the <br/>
biggest thing I learned is PATIENCE (and that my eyes are getting <br/>
old!). I used the pink stuff (Speedball Speedy Carve), SHARPENED <br/>
Speedball lino blades 1 and 5, and a SHARPENED X-Acto knife (I keep a <br/>
small whetstone with my carving supplies).<br/>
<br/>
There is no secret I can share, other than work VERY slowly (it's <br/>
easy to slip and carve more than you had planned), and be patient. I <br/>
put my carving down several times and returned to it after I was <br/>
refreshed.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to consider is make sure you use a typeface that is fairly <br/>
bold and open. I used Ariel which was OK. Avant Garde is a good one, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, patience is a virtue!<br/>

WOW ! You are good!  I am awful at lettering.  Is tis going to be hidden?   <br/>
If so my son and I might have to travel in the spring just to hunt for it.<br/>

I hadn't thought of hiding it -- I didn't want to compete with the <br/>
Pokey Man series! Maybe I'll hide it anyway. I'll post an image of it <br/>
on my site and will let you know so you can see it. My eyes are STILL <br/>
tired!<br/>
