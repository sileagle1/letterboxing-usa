                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, so I'm up in the middle of the night because it's nice and quiet and my <br/>
brain can work now, so I go the LBNA site to upload my box clues and I see <br/>
what's happened and I can only hope I've been had.<br/>
<br/>
Funny?!?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I got the clues up.  So, Wes, there's two more for you and Jess to <br/>
go find now.  Let me know what you think, about these and the one at Lakeside.<br/>
<br/>
Rocky's Garden<br/>
and<br/>
Loose Park Rose Garden<br/>
<br/>
Also, I took the drive down along Blue River Rd to scout the area for the <br/>
Blue River Parkway box and it does seem really hilly and difficult for the <br/>
little ones to try so we may go find it one at a time this weekend if it <br/>
doesn't rain.  I did find a lovely waterfall just by the road that had just <br/>
enough water to be serene and photographed it.<br/>
<br/>
Happy April!<br/>
