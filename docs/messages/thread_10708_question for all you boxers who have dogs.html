<br/>
I do a lot of letterboxing alone with just my dogs.  When I get to a <br/>
spot but can't find the letterbox I always wish I had another person <br/>
with me.  Sometimes another person can see (or think of) something <br/>
you missed.  This can often times make the differenece between going <br/>
home with a successful stamp image or comeing back to look for the <br/>
box again another day.  <br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking ..... dogs have a great sense of smell &amp; they LOVE <br/>
to stiff around in the woods.  Has anyone thought of teaching their <br/>
dogs to "find" letterboxes?  This would work great for boxes under <br/>
the snow, in stone walls, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
My old dog, Katie, already knows the command "find it" to find an <br/>
item that has my scent on it.  I was thinking I could teach her to <br/>
find either a rubber stamp or a plastic container (since those are <br/>
the 2 main ingredients of a letterbox.)  I bet I could teach her to <br/>
find a letterbox in no time by putting dog treats in a letterbox and <br/>
hiding it around the house and the yard.  <br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it impress your friends the next time you take Fido out <br/>
letterboxing and you tell him to "find it" and he leads you right to <br/>
the letterbox!!<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever thought of doing this?<br/>

Terrific idea! Our chocolate lab, Otis, knows "hurry up!" (Great on <br/>
these bitter cold mornings: "Hurry up, Otie!" and off he runs to the <br/>
nearest tree to do his business.)<br/>
<br/>
How do you train dogs to alert on certain scents? I've seen them do <br/>
explosives and narcotics daily on my commute through a nuclear <br/>
submarine base gates...and I'd love to work on "where's the box?"<br/>

Howdy,<br/>
   We've on occassion had help from Ruth, our (almost) 4 year old <br/>
black lab, in finding letterboxes.  However she's much better at <br/>
finding trails that we can't seem to find.  So much so that she's <br/>
guided us out of certain areas where <br/>
our.....aahhhhhh....compass....aaaaaa.....malfunctioned...yaaaa.  <br/>
There's no doubt in my mind dogs can be tought to sniff out lb's, I <br/>
believe Max has done just that cool trick.  The one problem with it <br/>
is that if dogs can sniff out the box using a commercial spray, so <br/>
can most other critters in the woods.  I believe a few boxes have <br/>
been destroyed by critters, because of people opening a box after <br/>
having food on their hands.  (I think this was talked about a few <br/>
months ago.) I don't know how most animals would react to most sprays <br/>
and air fresheners, though.<br/>
<br/>
Hey just a thought.<br/>

Hi all lots on the latest DOG thread - I did have our old dog Gemma <br/>
working on finding boxes . We made a big fuss when we found it and  <br/>
she got her biscuit and play she was pretty good. We started with <br/>
boxes we knew where they were to zero in on a box we started close up <br/>
she was a good help on some and no help on others . She was the <br/>
daughter of the town's police dog and was even better at scaring <br/>
anyone who came upon us on the trail she looked most imntimidating! <br/>
She was a devoted friend.  A degenerative spinal condition took her <br/>
this past December she will be missed.   Now we have Abby  ( black <br/>
lab)I am working on getting her to walk. Not run , not yank my arm <br/>
just walk please. Sniffing for something specific is a long way off <br/>
in her thought process. Being protective is even further. Not diving <br/>
into lakes and ponds and taking Mom may be impossible. Try walking <br/>
past a pond when a flock of Canada Geese lands.... wet feet - I hate <br/>
wet feet! Oh well as spring comes I hope to take her more and then <br/>
you can get her exchange too.  Good luck I'm sure boxing dogs is not <br/>
far off! They are happy hours spent anyway.    Leader of the Pack<br/>

 Probably a little extreme for Letterboxing Pups!! My dog is a bird <br/>

Having a dog find drugs, if that's the dog's job, before it eats is not really that much different than making your own dog sit, down, or roll over to get a treat. <br/>
