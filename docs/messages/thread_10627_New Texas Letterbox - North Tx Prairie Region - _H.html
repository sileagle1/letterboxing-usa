The "Horned Owl" letterbox is located in Texas' oldest State Park, <br/>
Mother Neff.  Mrs. Isabella Eleanor "Mother" Neff donated six acres <br/>
of land in 1916 to the state to form this first park.  It now <br/>
comprises 259 acres, being developed by the CCC in the mid 30's.  The <br/>
park features 2.75 mils of hiking trails, with an Indian cave.  <br/>
Horned Owls are also visitors to this park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
Located 8 miles west of Moody on Hwy 236.  From Waco, go south on <br/>
Interstate 35.  Turn right (west) on Hwy 107, through Moody, to Hwy <br/>
236.  Turn left on Hwy 236 and look for the park on the right side <br/>
before the Leon River.<br/>
<br/>
Pick up a map at the entry station, and follow the road to the back <br/>
of the park.  At the "Old River Road" cutoff, stay right onto the <br/>
gravel road.  Go .3 miles, and park on the right at the 1st parking <br/>
area you come to.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Directly in front of you is a trail.  Climb down the steps <br/>
toward "Tonkawa Indian Cave".  From the end of the railing, go 20 <br/>
paces, across to the cave and then south on the uphill trail.  Find <br/>
the #26 marker on your right.  From this marker, continue uphill for <br/>
12 paces to a stone in the middle of the trail.  Climb up the chute <br/>
to your left, going East, for 10 paces to a large rock outcropping on <br/>
the right.  Find the tree in front of you with the West facing root <br/>
going under a rock lip (about belt high).  The box is under this lip, <br/>
about 1 foot from the tree base, behind some loose rocks.<br/>
