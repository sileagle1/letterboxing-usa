                    <div class="plaintext-content">I actually ended up deciding to do a website rather than a blog.  Another<br/>
artist I know uses freewebs.com, said it was incredibly simple, so I'm going<br/>
that route for my letterbox clues.  I went with just listing 4 of the boxes<br/>
I had last year to see how easy it really would be to do, didn't put up any<br/>
brand new clues yet, and wow, piece of cake.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how reliable these freewebs folks will turn out to be but<br/>
starting out was sure simple enough.<br/>
