Whew!!  I was worried she was caught up in an entire remodeling of a <br/>
grand retreat or something.  Thanks for the detective work Busy Bee.<br/>

How is Boxing in Texas?  Any new LBers in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure with the winter coming and the Snowbirds arriving in FL.  <br/>
FL will pick up in the near future.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Letterboxing in South Texas is improving, but very slowly. I think <br/>
there is just one new letterboxer besides me, and she lives several <br/>
hours away. Well, actually, two of my grown sons are interested, but <br/>
they have only talked about placing boxes, they aren't really <br/>
getting out there and doing it. And they don't make it a big <br/>
priority to go letterboxing, although when they do go, they love it <br/>
and 'plan' to go again soon, each time. :s<br/>
<br/>
The biggest boost we get down here as far as letterboxing activity, <br/>
is when a few avid and generous letterboxers from other parts of TX <br/>
make trips down here and both look for and place boxes. <br/>
<br/>
We have 'Snowbirds' here too, only they are called Winter Texans. I <br/>
don't know if there are any letterboxers among them or not....<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy your winter boxing! <br/>
