together (and for everyone who came!).  We (True Soccer Fan and I) thoroughly <br/>
enjoyed ourselves, though he decided to go and read his new book and dive into <br/>
some quiet time while I boxed.  It was so nice to meet so many great Maine-rs <br/>
(is that what people from Maine are called???) and to see so many familiar faces <br/>
from RI, MA and CT.  Kudos to all of you who figured out my personal <br/>
traveler!  And a special thank you to True Soccer Fan who didn't give out ANY clues <br/>
;-)  He made everyone work hard for the stamp :-)<br/>
<br/>
THough I didn't really get to eat at the gather, I hear that the food was <br/>
scrumptious (I was lucky to get a half of a hamburger, a hotdog, and a small <br/>
piece of cake between the mad stamping!!!!)!  BTW.... if any Maine-r picked up the <br/>
Order of the Red Hand HH, please place it in Maine for me :-)  I totally <br/>
forgot that I brought it, and left it at the gather.  I was going to place it at a <br/>
lighthouse today, but if someone else could place it in Maine, that would be <br/>
great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a great time, and great exchanges and new friends!  Hope to <br/>
see you all down in CT soon!<br/>
