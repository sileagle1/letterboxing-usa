<br/>
I was at the beach house in RI all weekend, and had a couple of hours to kill <br/>
before heading back to CT, so I decided to finish up the Wizard of Oz series <br/>
in the Carolina Management Area.  I started off ok, finding the last box on <br/>
the southern loop, then headed out to the northern loop.  BTW.... many of the <br/>
boxes on the northern loop are a little soggy.  I had trouble finding the second <br/>
box on the northern loop, since I found another obscured stone wall before <br/>
the one that the box was in.  I couldn't find the Hollow Tree Letterbox (Wanda <br/>
and Pete).  I did find Carolina North though.  Well.... justbetween the third <br/>
and fourth Oz box on the loop, I couldn't find the left to take for the last <br/>
box....  I went back and tried again...to no avail....  So then I didn't know <br/>
the easiest way to get out.   I ended up finding a dirt road and hiked out to <br/>
Switch Road and went south to Pine Hill.  I called Moonstone Baby and she was SO <br/>
nice to come and get me so I didn't have to walk the whole way to my car!  <br/>
What great friends I have!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will be going back with someone, so I don't get lost again!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

a little trail on the hike in? <grin><br/>

I too know how it feels to be lost in the woods. It happened once <br/>
doing field research and once while boxing. Not a fun experience <br/>
either.   <br/>
<br/>
A suggestion for those less-adventuresome individuals....GPS handheld <br/>
units are becoming VERY reasonably priced. And so as to not turn this <br/>
into geocaching, buy a little clip-on holder for it and clip it to <br/>
your belt or pack. That way you are not relying on the GPS; but in <br/>
case of emergency you have your trail into the woods plotted for you!<br/>
