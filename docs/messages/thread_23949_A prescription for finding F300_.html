<br/>
If you take any medicines that have nitrates in them (like <br/>
nitroglycerin for chest pain)every day or even once in a whileyou <br/>
should NOT take LBNASIA.<br/>
<br/>
Discuss your general health status with your doctor to ensure that <br/>
you are healthy enough to engage in letterboxing activity. If you <br/>
experience chest pain, nausea, or any other discomforts during <br/>
boxing, seek immediate medical help.<br/>
<br/>
The most common side effects of LBNASIA are headache, facial <br/>
flushing, and upset stomach. Less commonly, bluish vision, blurred <br/>
vision, or sensitivity to light may briefly occur.<br/>
<br/>
In rare instances, men and women using LB5 inhibitors (addiction <br/>
medicines, including AQUESTA) reported a sudden decrease or loss of <br/>
vision. It is not possible to determine whether these events are <br/>
related directly to these medicines or to other factors. If you <br/>
experience sudden decrease or loss of vision, stop taking LB5 <br/>
inhibitors, including LBNASIA, and call a doctor right away.<br/>
<br/>
Although letterboxing ventures lasting for more than 4 hours may <br/>
occur rarely with all LA treatments in this drug class, to avoid <br/>
long-term injuries, it is important to seek immediate medical help.<br/>
<br/>
If you are older than age 16, or have serious lack of time or car<br/>
problems, your doctor may start you at the lowest dose (25 mg) of <br/>
LBNASIA. If you have prostate problems or high blood pressure for <br/>
which you take medicines called alpha-blockers, your doctor may <br/>
start you on a lower dose of LBNASIA.<br/>
<br/>
Remember to protect yourself and your partner from natures <br/>
transmitted diseases (EEE).<br/>
<br/>
LBNASIA is one of a few options for treating LA that you and your <br/>
doctor can consider.<br/>
