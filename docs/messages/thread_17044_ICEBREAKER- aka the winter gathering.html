                    <div class="plaintext-content">hello all !! as i have previously mentioned, i just returned to CT <br/>
and am ready to get back to letterboxing. i wanted to start out by re-<br/>
hashing the topic of a mid winter gathering.(late jan.,early feb.)<br/>
previous talks placed such a gathering at northwest park and from the <br/>
look of things, several people were interestd. i know everone is <br/>
going to be extremely busy with the holidays and i think everone <br/>
would appreciate a little time to let their wallets cool down. i <br/>
would just like a little sounding off on the issue to know who is <br/>
interested.---- thanks for the time, NORTHSTAR<br/>
