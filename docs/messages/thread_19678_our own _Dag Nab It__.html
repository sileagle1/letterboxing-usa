WAY, dude! If the Pepe's are the Protectors of Newbies, <br/>
TeamGreenDragon is the Missionary to the heathen uninformed. Few have <br/>
done more for letterboxing than TGD: you may not be aware of all the <br/>
behind the scenes work that goes in to making this thing happen, but <br/>
if there is sweat equity in building the game, TGD is on the crew. <br/>
Thanks to Brian and Lori! Too bad their lawn is so patchy, though.<br/>

I agree! Brian and Lori have been our boxing buddies for a few years <br/>
now. NO ONE loves this game and plays it better than they. Be aware <br/>
that this list is part of the game. Personnas and personalities are <br/>
not always what they appear!<br/>
<br/>
But - Jay IS what he appears - one of the nicest guys you will ever <br/>
meet and a true boxing legend.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>
