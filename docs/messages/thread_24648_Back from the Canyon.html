Just had to give a holler here for those who hadn't heard how happy I am that I got to do <br/>
one of my "dream dayhikes" recently when I managed to hike from the South Rim of the <br/>
Grand Canyon to the North Rim in less than 10 hours, while still recovering from a re-<br/>
sprained ankle!  Pete and I had both backpacked the Grand Canyon 15 years ago the usual <br/>
"permit" way, packing down and staying at the campground on the way up, and several <br/>
years before that I had hiked rim-to-river-to-rim in 6 hours ( 17 miles, 9000' elevation <br/>
change), but I had thought that the days when I could hike the whole thing south to north <br/>
in one day ( 22 miles with well over 10,000' elevation change and huge temperature <br/>
variables), let alone in less than half a day, were long past - until Pete convinced me I <br/>
could still do it, while he literally drove 215 miles around to meet me on the other side - <br/>
what a wild trip!<br/>
<br/>
So, I got to accomplish one of my minor "life list" goals, while the very next day Pete got to <br/>
do one of his, thanks to acquiring a special passport which allowed us the   rare <br/>
opportunity of hiking all the way around Meteor Crater!  I might have a chance to write <br/>
about some of these and other adventures later on, but right now I'm just so backlogged <br/>
all the way to last spring and booked all the way through next spring that I don't know if I <br/>
can!  Suffice it to say, though, that letterboxing adventures, like Dennis and Donna's trek <br/>
through the Quabbin in MA or Mainekokopellian's recent fantastic night time "treasure <br/>
haunt", as well as many of our adventures out west still play a good part in our travel <br/>
plans, so if I gave anyone the idea that I really would have traded all my letterbox <br/>
experiences for one single trip through the Grand Canyon, I hope they know I was just <br/>
kidding! (I'd really only gladly give up the 5% "SWOA" - those Stamps Without Adventure!:-)<br/>
Hope to write more later, and thanks for all the "AWS" - Adventures with Stamps!<br/>

slowly running out...<br/>

&gt; ... I got to do one of my "dream dayhikes" recently when I managed <br/>

&gt; less than 10 hours, while still recovering from a re-sprained ankle! <br/>
<br/>
If and when we do it, we certainly won't make it in a day!  We'll<br/>
definitely need to spend a night or two at the bottom before hiking<br/>
back out.  We've wanted to backpack into the Painted Desert for many<br/>
years; that might be more likely for us.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; ... the very next day Pete got to do one of his, thanks to acquiring <br/>
&gt; a special passport which allowed us the rare opportunity of hiking <br/>
&gt; all the way around Meteor Crater!  <br/>
<br/>
Since when did they start issuing passes for that?  I walked all the<br/>
way around the Barringer Crater without a pass; all I needed to do was<br/>
pay a few bucks, and they certainly weren't restricting the number of<br/>
people.  If anything, not many people wanted to pay for the privilege.<br/>
 Granted, that was 33 years ago, but I am surprised that there seems<br/>
to be a need to regulate things there.  It's a neat hike, with a lot<br/>
of interesting things to see on the rim.<br/>
