Start at: <br/>
Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park<br/>
nearest town--Newcastle<br/>
King County<br/>
Washington<br/>
<br/>
CLUES: A truckload of porcupines was being transferred from the Pt <br/>
Defiance Park Zoo in Tacoma to the Cougar Mountain Zoo near <br/>
Issaquah. Instead of taking the interstates to the new location, <br/>
the driver opted to take a shortcut over Cougar Mountain because he <br/>
was hungry and wanted to get to the famous donut shop in Issaquah <br/>
before they turned off the `hot donuts now' sign. Well, his <br/>
shortcut proved a very unwise decision. He was whizzing around the <br/>
bend of SE Newcastle-Coal Creek Road heading East when he lost <br/>
control of the truck. Just as it was supposed to veer North, the <br/>
truck careened off the road and flipped over multiple times landing <br/>
in a gravel parking area. Being the careless person that he was, <br/>
his poorly tied-down cargo went flying deep into the woods. <br/>
Fortunately, no animals were hurt during this incidentin fact, the <br/>
only thing really injured was this man's pride! Well, the precious <br/>
prickly cargo ended up somewhere near the Ford Slope mining <br/>
exhibit. Confused and dazed a bit, one member of this precious <br/>
cargo managed to wriggle himself from his cage. He found himself <br/>
near a mining car full of coal! Anxious to find his way to his new <br/>
home at the zoo, he decided to set off on his own attempt to find <br/>
his way there. The confusion started to get the best of him. He <br/>
headed West on the Rainbow Town Trail until he saw the junction with <br/>
the Wildside Trail. He figured the zoo would HAVE to be near <br/>
something with a Wildside. He ventured South for a tad and then <br/>
started to grow a bit weary and a bit warm from the trek. He <br/>
noticed some nearby steam but wanted to avoid it at all costs. He <br/>
eventually noticed his namesake-trail and just HAD to investigate <br/>
it. Lo &amp; behold, it was paradise (at least it was for him)! Here <br/>
he found a lawn chair, tropical drinks and some shades under some <br/>
bark behind what he thinks was the first large alder on the right. <br/>
So, he decided to stay and kick back in the area for the rest of his <br/>
life!!! <br/>
<br/>
Note: This is a rather short stroll. Don't miss the Bagley Seam <br/>
Trail during your visit. It's worth the stroll!<br/>
