                    <div class="plaintext-content">Seriously..you found a note of encouragement in the wrong tree <br/>
hollow??  I love it! Even if your comment is tongue in cheek, it <br/>
certainly opens up a whole new dimension to letterboxing.  Kind of <br/>
like those mystical 8-balls.  Is that the name??  Well,  people of my <br/>
generation know what toy I'm referring to.  You shake the ball, turn <br/>
it over ask a question, turn it upright and get such pearls of wisdom <br/>
as  "Ask again later". "Not at this time" "Wait and See", "Yes, of <br/>
course".<br/>
  Aeu de Off--perfect description.  I could see the whole <br/>
letterboxing hunt as clear as day..if only there wasn't that danged <br/>
blackout.<br/>
  Your family dinner sounds like it was a  lovely time- and no <br/>
cutting up food or nasty messy condiments of mass destruction (a.k.a. <br/>
plastic ketchup and mustard pouches which squish and squirt so <br/>
delightfully in the right[wrong] hands.).<br/>
            What was that Roy Rogers' tune?  Something about happy <br/>
trails, I believe.  Keep on keeping on. <br/>
