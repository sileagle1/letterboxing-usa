Fascinating, this ad brings back memories. Memories of a time a few years <br/>
ago in eastern CT before the "Courant Article". It was a time when news of a <br/>
new box posting was acted upon almost immediately with some (including <br/>
myself) going out even into the dark to be the first finder of these new <br/>
boxes. There were some fights, some biting, crying, but in the end there was <br/>
laughter and fellowship. We are a more civilized people now and have not the <br/>
need for first findership. Our developed letterboxing ways have purged the <br/>
yearning of first findership from our emotions. Through meditation we have <br/>
found peace withourselves and with each other.<br/>
