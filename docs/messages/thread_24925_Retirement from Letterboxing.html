<br/>
I've been doing a lot of thinking about this hobby lately.  I've been <br/>
having a lot of work at home, with finding a new job, with keeping the <br/>
house on budget, with picking out cabinets, windows, doors etc and <br/>
being a newlywed.  I write this with a heavy heart that I will no <br/>
longer participate in traditional letterboxing.  I've met many <br/>
wonderful friends along the way, many of whom I hope will continue to <br/>
include me in non-letterboxing activities in the future (setback <br/>
anyone????? ;-).  I'm just finding it hard to juggle Peter, the house, <br/>
and the job hunt.<br/>
<br/>
I will still participate in the Live and Breathe gather in Oregon next <br/>
month, but that will be my last gathering.  Good luck to all of you and <br/>
I hope to see you around soon.  Perhaps I'll have a chance to come back <br/>
to boxing in a few years when my husband approves, and when my life <br/>
calms down somewhat.<br/>

That means you are not coming to Knoebels!<br/>
<br/>
I don't think there is such a thing as retiring from letterboxing, just <br/>
a refocusing of life priorities. You may not go to many gatherings, you <br/>
may not participate on the many boards and such, you may not even plant <br/>
any longer, but what is really to stop you from spending some time <br/>
outdoors every once in a while? There is still the simple joy of the <br/>
hunt, the thing that really lures all to the hobby, it needs to be <br/>
slaked every once in a while, and takes little time to do so. You know <br/>
what they say about all work and no play after all.<br/>
<br/>
I of course wish you luck in your life's endeavors, and hope to see you <br/>
out there sooner rather then later.<br/>

I haven't been able to find a box of yours yet, but do hope that you <br/>
will enjoy your other activities as much as you must have enjoyed <br/>
Letterboxing.  Best Wishes.<br/>
