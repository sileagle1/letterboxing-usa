As for hybrids, we had a very nice person tie in her geocache to a series of<br/>

left her clues in the boxes, just changing out our log books when needed.<br/>
Never once had a problem with the geo folks.<br/>

we ever tried - we didn't even find the box!  But we did find where <br/>
it was supposed to be, and what we got was a pleasant walk in the <br/>
woods that wound up at a fishing poind with a waterfall that was way <br/>
peaceful!  Never would have found it or gone there without the <br/>
boxing clues.  It's all in the surprise and adventure, people!  The <br/>
stamps are just part of it, IMHO!<br/>
