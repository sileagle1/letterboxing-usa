Folks ... lets try to be respectful of everyone's choices.  This list <br/>
is not about religion AT ALL.  Bigguy was simply reporting his find <br/>
of a hitchhiker.  <br/>
<br/>
This list is about letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep your posts about religion, sexual orientation, etc.  OFF <br/>
THE LIST.  <br/>
*glares threateningly and waggles a pointed finger like my mother <br/>
used to*<br/>
<br/>
To the Reverend ...  I'm sorry that you are offended by simply the <br/>
name of a stamp.  Please remember that this hobby is enjoyed by <br/>
people who follow many paths.  Should you find something you disagree <br/>
with - particularly in the way of an HH, then simply disregard it.  <br/>
That is the only advice I can provide.  <br/>
<br/>
To PaganDC ... This is not the place for your request.  Might I <br/>
suggest that you (and anyone else with a particular interest) simply <br/>
form another letterboxing message board, post that it exists, and <br/>
folks of like mind may join.  To do otherwise will simply encourge <br/>
many posts that are off topic.  You can also contact people offlist <br/>
privately if you believe they share your views.<br/>
<br/>
Please folks.  This sport is about respecting Earth, getting out <br/>
there hiking and treasure hunting.  Let's try a little respect for <br/>
each other in the process.<br/>

It is for the reasons that Autumn speaks off that I<br/>
hesititated over saying anything last night. For those<br/>
on the list that are unaware, I am also a list mod,<br/>
and I knew full well that I, of all people, should not<br/>
have done what I did. Bad example and all that. <br/>
<br/>
So, to all of the members, the other list mods and,<br/>
most especially, the list owner, I am going to<br/>
publically apologize again, and offer to resign my<br/>
post as a mod for breaking the rules so blatantly.<br/>
This is absolutely the last thing I'm going to say on<br/>
this subject publically. Anyone that wants to discuss<br/>
this with me, please do so offlist. Let's get back to<br/>
what this list is for. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone up for a good hike? :-)<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
Mike S.<br/>

I believe, because I relayed that I am gay and pagan looking for<br/>
likeminded letterboxers I'm told, essentially, to go elsewhere and<br/>
start my own group.  That this is not the place.<br/>
<br/>
I was not proselytizing or recruiting.  <br/>
I shared an idea of themed stamps.<br/>

Where would be the place for my request?  <br/>
