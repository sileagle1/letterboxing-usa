list I believe that it is Randy, Mischief and Jay Drew.  I would <br/>
recommend that whenever you see something offensive like this that <br/>
you immediately contact them directly as they all have other <br/>
interests and real jobs and probably don't regularly check the other <br/>
sections of the group site.  <br/>
