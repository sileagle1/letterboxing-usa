Letterboxers wear Khakis.  Or jeans.  Or shorts, if they're not scared of poison ivy.  And rainjackets when they're crazy enough to go 'boxing in a downpour.  And sunscreen, bug spray, big backpacks to hold all those stamp pads and box first aid supplies and extra bug spray and their very important water, and good hiking boots, and...<br/>

I must say, I'm a little jealous!  I ordered from Stampeaz on my birthday (9/22) and still haven't gotten my kit!  Oh well, good for you!  And as soon as I get mine, I'll let you know how it's gowing...<br/>

  I made a very simple "positive" stamp for my first personal with a <br/>
  rubber stamp, it was pretty rough, but not bad. I put in an order <br/>
  with stampeaz and got my order in today. I scanned out my picture <br/>
  (Calvin of Calvin &amp; Hobbes) and traced it and transferred it. LOL, <br/>
