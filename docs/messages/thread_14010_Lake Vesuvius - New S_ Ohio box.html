A few miles north of Ironton, Ohio off State Route #93, is a lovely <br/>
state park on the site of an old 19th century iron furnace.  It is <br/>
named Lake Vesuvius State Park after the Vesuvius Furnace which <br/>
operated there.  Drive into the park, bearing left at the old furnace <br/>
stack and parking in the lot near a shelterhouse just past the <br/>
furnace.  Walk back to the spillway, which is just across the road <br/>
from the furnace, and climb the stairs to the top of the dam.  Pause <br/>
a moment to catch your breath and enjoy the picturesque little lake <br/>
before you.  (At least it should be before you  when we planted this <br/>
box the lake bed was dry and resembled a hay field in need of <br/>
cutting!  I suppose the state will eventually put the water back <br/>
in.)  Refreshed, you can now turn and notice another set of steps to <br/>
the right of the ones you just climbed going further up the hill.  <br/>
Climb 13 of these steps.  Take a bearing of 70 and walk about 5 <br/>
paces (1 pace = 2 steps) to a fence.  At the fence, take a bearing of <br/>
340 and go 3 paces to a medium sized tree.  You should find the Lake <br/>
Vesuvius stamp hiding under a small fallen log at the base of this <br/>
tree.  Note that the Little Boar box is also in the area.  Have fun!<br/>
