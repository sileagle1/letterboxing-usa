Texas History Letterbox Series<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The "Lamar" letterbox was placed in honor of the 2nd President of the <br/>
Republic of Texas, Mirabeau Buonaparte Lamar.  Born in Georgia, Lamar <br/>
followed James W. Fannin, Jr. to Texas in 1835.  He became a war hero <br/>
at the battle of San Jacinto, saving Thomas Rusk's life and gaining a <br/>
salute from the Mexican line due to his quick actions.  He served as <br/>
Vice President to Sam Houston in 1836, then was elected President in <br/>
1838.  He is known as the "Father of Texas Education".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Lamar" letterbox is located at a roadside park just outside of <br/>
Richmond on Hwy Alt 90.  From Houston, take Hwy 59 South to Hwy 99.  <br/>
Go right on 99 for about 3 miles to Hwy Alt 90, turn left toward <br/>
Richmond.  In about 4 miles look for a historical marker sign.  Just <br/>
after the light at FM 359, pull in to the roadside park on your right <br/>
with the historical marker near the road.  After reading the sign, <br/>
drive to the end of the loop road in front of you and park.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Locate the creek bed in front of you.  Walk toward Hwy Alt 90 and <br/>
across the tunnel to the other parking area (across the creek from <br/>
your car).  Go to the 1st cement structure (picnic table supports on <br/>
cement slab) up the bank near this other park road.  From that slab, <br/>
follow the road's right edge, as it follows the creek, to the 4th <br/>
cement slab (again this is an old picnic table slab) for a total of <br/>
35 paces.  At this 4th slab, locate the 3rd tree along the slab's <br/>
left side (the one closest to the creek).  The box is on the backside <br/>
of the tree, under the raised root facing the creek bed, under a rock <br/>
pile.  Please re-cover well!!!<br/>
