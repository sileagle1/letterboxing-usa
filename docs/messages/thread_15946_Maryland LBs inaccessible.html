                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought I'd drop the list a line to mention that two different MD <br/>
letterboxes are currently inaccessible.  Ours, located in Downs Park<br/>
in Pasadena, MD cannot be reached due to park closure, as is also the <br/>
case with another placer's box at Sandy Point SP.  We tried to go to <br/>
our box today to make sure that everything survived the hurricane, <br/>
but were met with barricades at the entrance.  The park looks to have <br/>
sustained substantial damage, not suprising since it is right on the <br/>
Chesapeake Bay.  I am not sure when it will reopen.  We also wanted <br/>
to go search for the Sandy Point box.  Sandy Point is also closed due <br/>
to storm damage, but I'm hoping that will be back in service before <br/>
the end of the week.  Perhaps there was more damage further in the <br/>
park, but nothing looked too terribly bad from beyond the toll gate.<br/>
