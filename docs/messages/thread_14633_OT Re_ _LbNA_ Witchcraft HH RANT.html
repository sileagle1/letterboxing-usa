Please forgive me if I have offended anyone, but it is very frustrating to <br/>
hear opinions like that, and I feel the need to try and educate. I respect <br/>
anyone who finds solace, peace and a path within their spirituality, whatever it <br/>
may be, but I also think wisdom comes from learning the open-minded truth about <br/>
others' ways, be they Jewish, pagan, Islamic or Buddhist or Native <br/>
American...or what have you.<br/>
