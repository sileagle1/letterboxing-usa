everyone on this board might like to know (if you haven't heard yet) <br/>
as well.<br/>
<br/>
A number of tornadoes came through Illinois last night. 22 was the <br/>
last count I heard. Some towns were hit, mainly Utica. Downtown Utica <br/>
is a disastor right now, so if anyone plans on finding the Starved <br/>
Rock boxes, I don't know if you can get through the area or not.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho...just plan on checking online newspapers of the city you plan <br/>
to visit to see if they had any damage. Some boxes might be in areas <br/>
that are off limits for the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I'm from Rockford and we weren't hit, so the Red Rover box should be <br/>
alright, if you plan on visiting that one. Like I said, though, check <br/>
before you make your plans. :)<br/>
