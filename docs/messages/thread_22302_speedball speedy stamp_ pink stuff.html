<br/>
I've used the pink stuff happily, but now &amp; then a stamp seems to pick<br/>
up oil easily.  I clean it with anything that will cut grease<br/>
(technically, any surfactant will work) such as dishwashing liquid or<br/>
shampoo.<br/>
<br/>
It's important to rinse the product off very well, so residue doesn't<br/>
linger and dry out the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps!<br/>

Cheerfully,<br/>

<br/>
My experience with the pink stuff, it isn't particularly resistant to<br/>
ink. Perhaps the ink itself may not be a good match for the carving block?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you both for the suggestions - when I found out there were<br/>
little colored pads and pens one could use for inking, I went to get<br/>
some to replace the big red commercial stamp pad I was carrying around<br/>
- looking now I see they are both made by same mfg., Rubber Stampede.<br/>
 I bought a set of 10 little square pads and a small pen set.  I'll<br/>
try washing the stamp with some gentle dish soap and see if that helps<br/>
and will try a different brand of ink next time.  I've seen the cat's<br/>
eye pads and know now that they would be good because of their shape<br/>
anyway.  I had the impression one was not supposed to wash the stamps<br/>
with anything except plain water.  Mine are probably just a bit oily<br/>
from my hands.  Actually my personal stamp is doing it too, and it is<br/>
on some white stuff someone gave me, no idea what brand that was, so<br/>
it is probably the ink or just oil on the surface.  If they keep doing<br/>
this I will just pretend I'm going for a colorwash effect - I tried<br/>
fooling around with a camp Q-tip and smearing colors together and got<br/>
some interesting images that way.  Thanks again - have a good weekend.<br/>

Washed, rubbed with light paper, washed again - much better, is<br/>
holding more ink without the ink separating so much.  Thanks again all<br/>
of you.<br/>
