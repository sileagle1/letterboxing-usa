Like National Parks, Chester County Parks (and other parks in<br/>
Pennsyvania) have rules and regulations about placing anything in the<br/>
park without permission.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest contacting the Pennsylvania Recreation and Park<br/>
Society who can get you more information about all of the Pennsylvania<br/>
Recreation and Park agencies and main contact information. The<br/>
Pennsylvania Recreation and Park Society may be reached at<br/>
814-234-4272 or at www.prps.org.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have been discussing this on the LBMA message board since Chester<br/>
County is in our area.  I think I may be the one who got the ball<br/>
rolling on this when a county park discovered that I had planted boxes<br/>
in their park.  They simply asked that I send them some info so that<br/>
they could store this info in case anyone would report a suspicious<br/>
box in the park.  The park official forwarded me a form to fill out<br/>
which I did and he granted permission immediately.  I placed a copy of<br/>
this form in the file section of the LBMA board.  I have to say that I<br/>
am totally pleased with the way that this was handled by the county<br/>
park official that I was dealing with, he was courteous, informative<br/>
and very supportive and I urge anyone else who wishes to plant a box<br/>
in Chester County, PA, to use the form first.<br/>
