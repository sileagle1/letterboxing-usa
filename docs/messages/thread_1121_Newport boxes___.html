The Purgatory Chasm letterbox (2nd box in the Purgatory point hike) was <br/>
vandalized.  When I arrived at the oak tree, the container was open, full of <br/>
water, the lid was found in the bushes and the inkpad and ziplock bag in <br/>
another area.  The stamp and notebook were not there.  A few beer bottles <br/>
were under the tree. I'm not sure about the 1st either, Sakonnet Point box <br/>
of that hike.  I'm pretty sure I was in the right spot but couldn't find the <br/>
box.  Has anyone found it recently?<br/>
<br/>
Despite finding the box vandalized, I had a thoroughly refreshing time.  <br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>
The Fort Adams, Fast Passage(beautiful at sunset), and Bay of Bristol boxes <br/>
are all fine.  I only had time for one box at the Norman Bird Sanctuary.  <br/>
what wonderful views!  I hope more people get a chance to go there.  I know <br/>
I'll be back!<br/>

(I better update my count!)<br/>

Did you have the clues for the "new" box out at the end of Purgatory <br/>
Point? Or were you at the "old" site under the observation tower?<br/>
<br/>
Newport is truly one of the most beautiful places in the world!<br/>
