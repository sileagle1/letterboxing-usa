and the family and I enjoyed searching for some of Salamander's boxes <br/>
in Great Seal State Park.  We found "Mound Eyes" and "Morel of the <br/>
Story" without much trouble and "Pining Away" after an exhaustive <br/>
search but sadly "Kick Up Your Heels" seems to be missing.  Has <br/>
anyone seen it lately?  Salamander, you're really good at this!  Keep <br/>
up the good work!!!<br/>
