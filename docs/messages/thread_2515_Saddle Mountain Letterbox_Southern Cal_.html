<br/>
I just wanted to post to the list that Quackers was rescued up on Saddle<br/>
Mountain just East of Seaside on the Oregon Coast this past weekend by John<br/>
and me.  Looks like Ryan has got a following!  Gwen and Don found his<br/>
letterbox in California!  Now if I could just get the time to get to the<br/>
John Day Fossil Beds to collect his other gems.  That will be a ways in the<br/>
future, though.  My summertime is getting pretty booked up.<br/>
<br/>
I will be in Buena Park, California this weekend.  Are there any letterboxes<br/>
close to that area within walking distance or is there public transit?  We<br/>
will be hitting Knott's Berry Farm, but won't have wheels.  If we could nab<br/>
a box or two nearby and someone has insight on getting to them without a<br/>
car, I'd be most appreciative.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

It's starting to look that way.  I'm glad you (Don and Gwen) enjoyed <br/>
Los Osos Oaks.  I love that area and it's remarkable how few locals <br/>
even know the place exists--dispite being right next to a major road <br/>
that anyone who's lived in or around San Luis for more than two <br/>
months has probably passed.  I'll have to check out your stamps the <br/>
next time I'm in the area.  =)<br/>

I don't know of any letterboxes in that area, but if you'll be in <br/>
Buena Park, ditch Knott's Berry Farm and go visit Medieval Times <br/>
instead.  (www.medievaltimes.com)  It's a blast!  Much more <br/>
interesting than Knotts is.  Well, I have to admit, it's been a LONG <br/>
time since I've gone to Knotts.  I think I was about eight or nine <br/>
the last time I went (nearly 20 years ago), but it was just plain <br/>
boring compared to Medieval Times--which I've gone to several times <br/>
over the years.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And if there aren't any letterboxes in the area, do what I do: Hide <br/>
them yourself.  Perhaps under a highway overpass or something?  =)<br/>
