<br/>
Although I am a bit perturbed that my personal traveler was stolen <br/>
from my cell and placed on e-bay I am overjoyed that at long last I <br/>
will be able to reclaim my property by placing an astronomical bid <br/>
that none of you peons could match in your wildest dreams.<br/>
<br/>
What saddens me is that Hazel, my closest confidant, disclosed to <br/>
some scum sucking guard the super secret hidey hole I created for my <br/>
namesake handcarved masterpiece.  I told her my secret one desperate <br/>
night as it was the only way to avoid the inevitable late night <br/>
swirly attack.<br/>
<br/>
So welcome home my dear friend.  I have missed you!  And if any of <br/>
you freaky people think you will ever get your hands on my stamp <br/>
again be prepared to receive the business end of my makeshift mother <br/>
of pearl shank.<br/>
<br/>
So long suckers!<br/>

Hey BullDawg,<br/>

 I don't believe I've seen you at any of the conventions or what not.<br/>
Are you carrying a card or just freelancing?<br/>
