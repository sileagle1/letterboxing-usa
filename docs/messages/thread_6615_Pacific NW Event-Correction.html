&gt; Hey Folks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Its only 9 days away from Saturday 8-10-02 and time for our Pacific NW <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing event.  Woohoo!   I'm getting excited about it!   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Funhog said I could be the direction gal.  I've not been there myself, which <br/>
&gt; is why I've done a bunch of research.  I'm checking the park out this weekend <br/>
&gt; and will let you know if I discover anything new.  Below is what I know (and <br/>
&gt; Funhog confirms that I am on the right track):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Upper Macleay Part is part of the much larger Forest Park.  Its the far south <br/>
&gt; map you want to look at.  (There are 5 maps total.)  Please note that the map <br/>
&gt; is oriented with North in the upper left corner: <br/>
&gt; <a href="http://explorepdx.com/forpark5.html">Forest Park far south</a><br/>
&gt; <a href="http://explorepdx.com/forpark.html">Forest Park Index Map</a> <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One possible route is:<br/>
&gt; --First find directions to W Burnside and NW 23rd.  <br/>
&gt; --From there head North on NW 23rd.  The street names in this area of NW <br/>
&gt; Portland are all alphabetical.  (i.e. Burnside, Couch, Davis, Everett etc.)<br/>
&gt; --Turn left on Lovejoy, the "L" street.<br/>
&gt; --Lovejoy automatically becomes Cornell.  (See this area in the "Far South" <br/>
&gt; map).  <br/>
&gt; --The park is on the left!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remember, we are meeting at UPPER Macleay Park, which is to the right of <br/>
&gt; Cornell when you look at the map. (Don't confuse it with Lower Macleay Park <br/>
&gt; which is more well-known.)  Funhog says, "Also, the Audubon House is just <br/>
&gt; west of Upper Macleay Park.  Many trails diverge from this point and that's <br/>
&gt; why we picked it instead of the lower one which has but one."  Sounds good to <br/>
&gt; me!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Please ask if you have any questions.  Hope to see you <br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
