                    <div class="plaintext-content">The main Texas gathering was held last year in Rusk and lots of new boxes<br/>
were planted there.  Right after the gathering, we had an influx of new<br/>
boxers in the area who, sadly, were a little too late for the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Because some of these new boxers are wanting to meet up and because last<br/>
year's attendees left behind such a great crop of boxes, we are going to<br/>
have a reprise of the gathering, meeting in Rusk At Rusk State Park on<br/>
January 20th at 10 a.m. and going until we all get tired and go home!  Lunch<br/>
will be potluck, but we do have power available for heating.  Also, there is<br/>
a big fireplace in the middle of the gathering location, so if it is cold,<br/>
we'll have a roaring fire for those who want to stay close and visit.  All<br/>
are welcome, but please - RSVP on AtlasQuest for a headcount.<br/>
<br/>
Any questions, email me at barefootlucy at gmail dot com.<br/>
