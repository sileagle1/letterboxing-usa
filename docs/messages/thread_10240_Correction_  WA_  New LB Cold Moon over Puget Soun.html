Thank you immensely!  Signed one whose life is way too chaotic to <br/>

&gt; Cold Moon Over Puget Sound Letterbox <br/>
&gt; Placed By:  DVN2R CKR <br/>
&gt; Please send comments regarding this letterbox to:  blee@p...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Start at: <br/>
&gt; Cormorant Park<br/>
&gt; intersection of Chapman Loop with itself<br/>
&gt; Steilacoom, WA<br/>
&gt; Pierce County <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; From I-5 North &amp; South:  Take Exit 119 `Steilacoom/DuPont Rd. <br/>
&gt; Exit'.  Turn west off the highway and at the first 4 way <br/>
&gt; intersection (Steilacoom Hwy) after the railroad tracks, turn <br/>
&gt; right.  Continue on this road for 6 miles.  You will be driving <br/>
&gt; through North Fort Lewis at this point.  Eventually the road will <br/>
&gt; take you through a residential area that is the quaint seaside <br/>
&gt; village of Steilacoom.  Immediately turn left (West) on Cormorant <br/>
&gt; Drive (the 1st residential street once you start down the hill in <br/>
&gt; the village of Steilacoom about the time you can see Puget Sound <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; front of you)this turn will happen right after you see the speed <br/>
&gt; limit reduced from 45 mph to 35 mph.  Continue straight until you <br/>
&gt; reach a stop sign (the intersection of Chapman Loop with itself).  <br/>
&gt; The park is immediately on your right.  Park legally where you can <br/>
&gt; and your trek will begin at the playground.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Average roundtrip time for the letterbox:  5 minutes<br/>
&gt; Roundtrip distance:  maybe 1/16 mile, depending on where you park <br/>
&gt; Degree of difficulty:  EASY but includes stairs or a slope on a <br/>
&gt; gravel trail!!!  Suitable for very small children and pets.  <br/>
Other:  <br/>
&gt; Bring a picnic lunch and enjoy time at the park or visit one of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; nice eating establishments in Steilacoom.  <br/>

&gt; Cold Moon Over Puget Sound Letterbox<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Placed:  7 January 2003 <br/>
&gt; December's Full Moon is also known as the `Cold Moon'.  This stamp <br/>
&gt; was inspired by a front page photo in one of the local newspapers <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; December.  Enjoy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; CLUES:  Slide down the slide.  From the disk below the steps on <br/>
the trail, take 80 paces North to a multi-trunked tree to your <br/>
&gt; Southwest.  Your treasure is hidden in a nice little cubby hole <br/>
&gt; behind the tree.  Please stamp in discreetlythis is a popular <br/>
trail <br/>
&gt; for the locals!!!  Use the markers enclosed within for a multi-<br/>
&gt; colored image similar to the actual photo!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NOTE:  For a nice longer stroll with multiple letterboxes(4), you <br/>
&gt; can link this letterbox trek with those of Saltar's Point and the <br/>
&gt; Old Town Steilacoom Series.  To do this, after Cold Moon, continue <br/>
&gt; North on the trail and continue on the road (1st Ave) until it's <br/>
&gt; Northern most terminus.  This will be the entrance to Saltar's <br/>
Point <br/>
&gt; Beach.  Then after that letterbox, head East until you meet Union <br/>
&gt; Ave.  Turn North until you bump into Pioneer Park which is where <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Old Town Steilacoom Series begins.  Linking all of these <br/>
letterboxes <br/>
&gt; would make it about a 3-1/2 mile casual walk through a nice, <br/>
quaint <br/>
&gt; village that offers great views of Puget Sound and some of its <br/>
&gt; islands.<br/>
