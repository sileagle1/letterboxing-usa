&gt; &gt; This way you could go up to 987 on each letter giving account for<br/>
&gt; &gt; duplicate numbers.  You could even borrow a numeral not being used<br/>
&gt; &gt; from another swatch if need be.  Just adding a few cents to the <br/>
pile.<br/>

&gt; Brilliant!  What about the Scout Den &amp; Pack #'s??<br/>
<br/>
I had thought of those #'s but I think they would be too big. If my <br/>
scouting memory is correct they are about 1" tall and 3/4" wide <br/>
but "if size doesn't matter" they can be bought in three different <br/>
colors.  Yellow/blue from cub scouts,Red/white from boy scouts and I <br/>
think brown/black from girl scouts. Can any of you scout parents <br/>
confirm my asumptions.  Three colors could represent P,F,&amp; X.<br/>

I checked my daughter's sash and that is the right size.  The girl <br/>
scouts sell them in brown, green and blue for $.70 each.  That is <br/>
kind of large but I think if we keep checking there must be a ready <br/>
made source for uniforms, etc. somewhere that are a little smaller.  <br/>
If not they are cheap and available everywhere.<br/>

THis is a possibility.  :o)  <br/>

 I am still partial to a unique numbering patch for LbNA.   Small little <br/>
circles with the A from the logo on it.  :o)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The "Unit Numeral" patches come currently in Blue/gold<br/>
and Red/White. If you look for them you will also find<br/>
them in Green/white..... without having to spend a<br/>
fortune..they sold for as little as .25 but i think <br/>
like everything else they may now be up to about .33<br/>
cents.....<br/>

HOLD THE PRESSES&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
the boy scouts of america produce little "Unit<br/>
Anniversary" patches the come in numerals like<br/>
10,15,25,30,40,50,75,80,and 90.....of course thats<br/>
only how high they go now...the scouts celebrated<br/>
their 90th last year... patches such as 25 comes in<br/>
silver 50 in gold and i think 90 is a different<br/>
color.....these patches are only like .20 cents a<br/>
piece........<br/>
