<br/>
Being an experienced hiker/ outdoor fanatic I have discovered a few<br/>
things for bug prevention.  Think about this for a xmas gift for the<br/>
letterboxing people in your life.<br/>
<br/>
Do a google search for SUPPLEX NYLON ANORAK.  Basically this is a<br/>
hooded sweatshirt made of supplex nylon, with elastic wrists.  During<br/>
the heat of summer, the weave of the fabric will breath, but bugs can<br/>
not bite through it.  If it gets wet it will dry in moments when the<br/>
rain stops.  You put up the hood when the bugs get bad (over your<br/>
baseball cap).  I think I bought mine for $15 online.<br/>
<br/>
Also try putting that permythrin (not sure of the name) on your<br/>
clothes.  Many have mentioned that it scares the ticks and the<br/>
mosquettos away (does not last on bare skin so can not be used there).<br/>
 There is always "Skin so soft" or DEET if you want to go the path of<br/>
more chemical warfare.<br/>
<br/>
Also get a small umbrella for the trail.  It is better than a sweaty<br/>
rain coat and the trails are so wide from use you can always fit the<br/>
umbrella through.  Much less expensive than goretex jackets.<br/>
<br/>
Invest in some wicking fabric nylon t-shirts.  They will keep you dry<br/>
even when it is hot and sweaty; and warm, when it is cold.  I think<br/>
www.campmor.com has some good cheap sources.<br/>
<br/>
Merry Xmas!!<br/>

hiking footwear at the best prices.<br/>
