Michigan.<br/>
Watch for signs along U.S. 2. From the intersection of Main and U.S.2 in<br/>
Norway it is 2 miles West to Pine Creek Road. Coming East out of Iron<br/>
Mountain, from the intersection of U.S.2 and  141 it is 3.8 miles to Pine<br/>
Creek Road. Turn North (the only way you can go) on Pine Creek Road and go<br/>
for 1.2 miles. You will see the sign on the left for Fumee Lake Natural<br/>
Area. This will take you to the East parking lot.<br/>
There  is an information sign near the start of the tril and several maps<br/>
posted at intersections of the trail.<br/>
