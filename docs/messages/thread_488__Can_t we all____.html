&gt; Can't we all just get along here?  This whole thing (the underpinnings of<br/>
&gt;  which I really have little understanding...or care to understand) is<br/>
&gt;  beginning to turn me off to a pastime that is fun and encourages people to<br/>
&gt;  get out and hike.  I refuse to let that happen.  I like letterboxing too <br/>
&gt; much.<br/>
<br/>
Marty,<br/>
I can relate all too well with you.  Letterboxing is just a game.  A way to <br/>
have fun.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone is getting too focused on websites.  We need a simple website to <br/>
post our clues on.  No restrictions.  No policies.  Just a website.<br/>
<br/>
I am removing the Moderation feature for this talk list, again.  The actions <br/>
I have taken recently were the result of a unanimous outcry from the users of <br/>
this list.  Some attempt had to be made to open everyone's eyes and make it <br/>
understood that we are not going to tolerate endess bickering and needless <br/>
restrictions.  I'm sorry if some were upset by this.<br/>

I think this is the best way.  This is how I'm handling my clues, as well.<br/>
They can then be linked to any site that I choose.<br/>
