Its logbook had filled up and the finder offered to mail it back to me after over 4,500 miles of travel across the country and almost 18 months. It's usually considered decorum to try to contact the placer in the case of a filled logbook to see if they would like it returned. Usually the placer's contact info (or at least their trail name) will be prominent on the HH so that this is made easier.<br/>

One year after 9-11-01 we sent out a hitch hiker "Honor Liberty". It <br/>
had a special request, and that was to post it's present location <br/>
(yep that is right, let everyone know where it was placed) and prior <br/>
to September every year we would like it returned to us. Sometimes <br/>
it took a little whinning, but we usually received it back, or <br/>
atleast the list of finders. Every year we posted the comments from <br/>
the finders on this list.<br/>
In the earlier years when there weren't as many HHers there were <br/>
races to go and retrieve. I think it has been back and forth across <br/>
the US at least twice. So if you find her it is okay to post the <br/>
location you leave her.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  I was curious to know if anyone has ever sent a hitchhiker on <br/>
&gt; it's way and &gt; &gt; gotten it back at some point. <br/>
<br/>
I have a cool hitchhiker story!  On October 15, 2005 we released our <br/>
hitchhiker "Owl Be Seeing You Around" in Hocking Hills OH.  We hadn't <br/>
heard anything about it, and figured it got lost.  Then in September <br/>
of 2006 I received an email from Captain Jack that the Owl had landed <br/>
in his Farm box in Westfield IN.  Now the concept of this box is very <br/>
cool.  It's a box that represents a box and finders are encouraged to <br/>
leave farm theamed stamps in it to build up the "Farm".  He had <br/>
commented on how fitting it was that an Owl landed at the farm.  <br/>
Needless to say, I retired my little owl as a hitchhiker and he's now <br/>
taking up permanent residence at the farm catching snakes and mice.  <br/>
Captain Jack sent the log book back to me, and included all the farm <br/>
stamps in it.  The stamps are just beautiful!  I've included the link <br/>
to the box.  <br/>
