                    <div class="plaintext-content">The recent discussion regarding inkpads prompted me to do some<br/>
research.  I've put together a couple of files on our yahoogroup that<br/>
some of you may be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
The first file, " Dye ink vs. Pigment ink" discusses the difference<br/>
between the two types and suggests which types to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
The file called "Permanent Inks - info and reviews" gives suggestions<br/>
and reviews of  dyes, pigments, chalks and hybrid inks that should<br/>
stand up to a soggy logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Also, because we love the chalk inks, we've included a file called,<br/>
"Chalk inks - a comparison of the various brands"<br/>
<br/>
Here is the link, if you'd like to view the files:<br/>

or use this shorter link: http://tinyurl.com/afkwo<br/>
<br/>
Note: you will have to join our Letterboxing Bindlestiff yahoogroup to<br/>
see the file.  Feel free to poke around the rest of the files while<br/>
you're there then if you don't want to remain a member, simply<br/>

is another option that offers an advantge over padding. I know of a few <br/>
LBoxerd that have switched to pens. The advantages are: 1) They are <br/>

can carry different colors for multi-coloring a stamp to give it a more <br/>
realistic and interesting impression; 4) You don't get ink on your <br/>
fingertips, on your clothes, or accidently smudge the logbook; 5)The <br/>
ink in the pen absorbs so the image doesn't offset onto the facing page <br/>
of the logbook; and 6) You tend to get a brighter image and don't need <br/>
to press as hard to get a full faced even impression.<br/>

Problem: With all the apparent advantages pens offer are LBoxers <br/>
compromising the art or craft of LBoxing if they use pens instead of <br/>
stamp pads???  ~~~  Journey   <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I use the LePlume II markers.  I bought the Primary Colors and Victorian<br/>
Colors set.  A little pricey, but use the 40%off coupons from Michaels or<br/>
JoAnn's in the Sunday flyers.  There are 108 different colors, but I only<br/>
carry 24.  I'll replace individual colors later.  I saw Uchida markers,<br/>
regularly 2.99, on sale for 1.98 in my Sunday Flyer yesterday. Even at the<br/>
sale price, I'll stick with what I have.  I carry several ink pads, too. <br/>
I understand color markers in your area are not that prevalent yet.  In my<br/>
area you will find more stamps designed for multiple colors.  These boxes<br/>
are relatively new (less than 2 years old). In no way do I believe the<br/>
artistic aspect of letterboxing is compromised by using various media to<br/>
achieve the placer's desired effect.  Some clues will indicate "bring your<br/>
color markers."  This is helpful, in my opinion.<br/>
