Gwen and I vote for planting boxes, one for Israel and one for France. Maybe  an image of Doves for Israel and I have another image in mind for France. You could have several firsts. First to hide a box and first to have it blown up if the authorities find it and think it is suspicious. In any case plant them and maybe take one of your hosts along with you and see if you can start some letterboxers in Israel. Hope to see you when you return and when we head north. Don<br/>

I think that it is a wonderful idea, leaving something of joy and<br/>
pleasure in a place that has seen so much war. But I worry that the<br/>
Isralies may be absolutly inflexible and without any humor when it<br/>
comes to anything that appears to compromise in the tinest way the<br/>
safety of their citizens (not to mention the possibility of some<br/>
terrist sicko leaving his own little "gift" behind along with the LB).<br/>
These people are living with daily death bombings, and any activity<br/>
out of the ordinary like this would be looked upon with suspicion.<br/>
Remember how nervous we felt after 9/11 and how we watched everyone? <br/>
Time and distance has soothed us, the Isralies don't have the luxury.<br/>
My son would tell me I'm being paranoid, but things have changed and<br/>
there are some bad people out there.<br/>
<br/>

How many letterboxers do you think will find your letterbox?<br/>

Weigh that against the reasons you are thinking about not placing it.  <br/>

I still think the Wailing wall is you best option to place a micro <br/>
box...unfortunately only women will be able to find your box, assuming you <br/>
are a woman. The finder can take to microbox to a quiet location stamp in <br/>
then return it.<br/>
It can be very discreetly done as the wailing wall is usually packed with <br/>
people sticking their prayers in the cracks in the wall.<br/>
I say go for it...and you can even write a prayer on your box like "Pray for <br/>
the peace of Jerusalem" just so it won't seem sacreligious!<br/>
<br/>
Who cares if anyone ever finds it...you will always remember when you placed <br/>
that special box and maybe only you will ever return to find it again, but <br/>
how cool would that be!!!<br/>

&gt;Here are the 2 questions that come to mind for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How may letterboxers are there in Israel?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How many letterboxers do you think will find your letterbox?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Weigh that against the reasons you are thinking about not placing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally sounds like a bad idea to me.<br/>

&gt;  I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; a big trip coming up on Wednesday.  I am leaving for one of my closest<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends weddings.  Before I go there, I will spend a week in France,<br/>
&gt;and I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; looking forward to finding what few boxes I've been able to locate<br/>
&gt;online<br/>
&gt; &gt; there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What's my debate?  The wedding I am going to is in Jerusalem.  My<br/>
&gt;friend is<br/>
&gt; &gt; from there and we met in college. I will be staying with her family<br/>
&gt;and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; professor of mine (in a safe neighborhood, and yes, I will be<br/>
&gt;careful).  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; really am tempted to plant a box somewhere in Israel since I don't<br/>
&gt;know that<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are any yet.  I don't think I dare do it in the city though where<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything left around could look like a bomb.  If I did chose to<br/>
&gt;plant a box,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would make it a microbox and hide it somewhere inconspicuous and<br/>
&gt;away from<br/>
&gt; &gt; the city, that didn't require compass readings or suspicious behavior to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tell me what you all think.  If I find a place like a quiet park or<br/>
&gt; &gt; something away from the bustle, do you think that I can make a plant<br/>
&gt;without<br/>
&gt; &gt; it being a source of trouble?  I would love to be one of the first<br/>
&gt;to plant<br/>
&gt; &gt; a box in a new country, but do you think it is okay if I do?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me know what you think.  Also, if you know of any boxes in France or<br/>
&gt; &gt; Israel, please let me know.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I rarely post to the list, but honestly, the thought<br/>
of placing a box at the Wailing Wall makes me cringe,<br/>
and I'm not particularly religious.  It IS<br/>
sacriligeous and an insult to those who journey to the<br/>
Wall to pray.  While some religous sites may not be<br/>
active sites of worship, the Wall is.  I know that<br/>
people visit it as a tourist site, but I see a<br/>
difference in observing the site and treating it as<br/>
part of a treasure hunt.<br/>
<br/>
I have a plethora of other reasons for arguing against<br/>
a microbox in Israel, but if you're going to do so,<br/>
please don't place it at the Wall.<br/>

&gt; I still think the Wailing wall is you best option to<br/>
&gt; place a micro <br/>
&gt; box...unfortunately only women will be able to find<br/>
&gt; your box, assuming you <br/>
&gt; are a woman. The finder can take to microbox to a<br/>
&gt; quiet location stamp in <br/>
&gt; then return it.<br/>
&gt; It can be very discreetly done as the wailing wall<br/>
&gt; is usually packed with <br/>
&gt; people sticking their prayers in the cracks in the<br/>
&gt; wall.<br/>
&gt; I say go for it...and you can even write a prayer on<br/>
&gt; your box like "Pray for <br/>
&gt; the peace of Jerusalem" just so it won't seem<br/>
&gt; sacreligious!<br/>
