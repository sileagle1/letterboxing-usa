<br/>
clue is posted at:<br/>
http://www.sharawadgi.com/letterbox/gordianknot.html<br/>
<br/>
(I also listed it at geocaching.com since the starting point is lat/lon.<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.asp?ID=5905)<br/>
<br/>
Here's the directions:<br/>
Begin at N 30 23.145' W 097 45.518' (WGS84)<br/>
There is a small cairn in a clearing which marks your starting point.<br/>
The letterbox rests at 14 feet at a bearing of 248 degrees,<br/>
then 40 ft. at 293 degrees,<br/>
then 23 degrees for 20 ft. to a small bush<br/>
then 19' at 113 degrees, followed by 32' at 203,<br/>
62' at 293, and 16' at 203,<br/>
to a small stone, then 12 more feet at 158,<br/>
then roughly 39' at 113,<br/>
then turning to 68 degrees for 39 feet to a small mound,<br/>
then 39 feet at 23 degrees,<br/>
12' at 338 degrees, and 16' at 293 to a small depression,<br/>
then a long 62' at 203, followed by<br/>
32' at 293, 19' at 23, 20' at 113,<br/>
40' at 203, 14' at 248, 128' at 23,<br/>
and 14' at 248 to another bush,<br/>
then 40' at 203, 20' at 113, 19' at 23,<br/>
32' at 293, 62' at 203 through the plants,<br/>
then 16' at 293, 12' at 338, 39' at 23,<br/>
and 39' at 68 to another rock,<br/>
then 39' at 113, 12' at 158 (watch out for the brush),<br/>
and 16' at 203, then the final run goes 62' at 293,<br/>
32' at 203, 19' at 113, 20' at 23,<br/>
40' at 293, and 14' at 248<br/>
to a spot adjacent to a small trail, beneath the ledge of a large rock. <br/>
(approximately 1' wide by 3' long)<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
