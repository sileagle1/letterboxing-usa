Just my two cents -- I really like reading about the adventures of others <br/>
(hope I'm not driving anyone nuts about listing ours!).  I really haven't <br/>
sensed a competitive nature.  I think those that list their counts are just <br/>
excited about how they are doing just as we are.  It makes them smile and it <br/>
makes us smile reading about it!  Thanks!  BeMa<br/>

&gt;Hey Wanda, Don't let anyone push you around. We enjoy seeing how you guys <br/>
&gt;are doing. I know I will never catch up to your count. It is not <br/>
&gt;competition here. Please post your stats. Besides that, I think Molly is <br/>
&gt;kind of fond of Pete. Keep up the good work. These people must not know you <br/>
&gt;very well.....your friends.....Chuck and Molly<br/>
