letterbox under our belt.  What a great trail.  They had been working on<br/>
it earlier in the day, so we were lucky to get a freshly maintained path<br/>
all the way up to Council Crest.  Thanks to Der Mad Stamper for placing<br/>
a stamp in another beautiful place I had never been to before.  Ryan was<br/>
the first to stamp in.  What a cute signature stamp, guy!<br/>
<br/>
It's early here on the West Coast right now, but we may head out soon.<br/>
I hear there's a duck that needs rescueing over near the Coast! <br/>
<br/>
