<br/>
This question comes up now and then and it is a very good one.<br/>
There has been some discussion as to the "standard" size - and truth be told, there <br/>
really isn't one...but many! <br/>
<br/>
I think it might depend on the type of box construction you use. If you're creating a <br/>
microbox- and it is a film canister- your logbook would be a scroll - obviously <br/>
minute and quite compact. If you're creating a hitchhiker hostel you would want a <br/>
small sized stamp for the hitchhiker logbooks, but a big box because it would have <br/>
to contain multiple visitors.<br/>
<br/>
General rule of thumb, make your boxes, logs and stamps appropriate to the <br/>
location. By this I mean, the "leave no trace" kind of ethic. If you think in advance <br/>
about the location, then you'll know what size box is appropriate and you can <br/>
construct the rest of your letterbox (and contents) around this premise.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, a crevace underneath a small rock gets a 2inchx1.5inch logbook <br/>
made by yours truly in a 3x3inch square box with a 1inchx1inch stamp. That is a <br/>
microbox for me. If I use the blue-top rubbermaid, then the stamp can be quite <br/>
large up to a 4x5inch or so and the log as well.<br/>
<br/>
It is a matter of taste and practice in making those items. Visit a number of boxes <br/>
to get a feel for what you like, but keep in mind your location and it will work!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

Ditto what Phyto said.   And if you're asking about your personal stamp, <br/>
again it's up to you.   Some people have two versions of their stamp, one for <br/>
"regular size" logbooks (whatever that is, and I suspect it's in the neighborhood <br/>
of 3"x5") and one for the micros.   Or, you can just stamp part of your stamp <br/>
when you find a micro.<br/>
