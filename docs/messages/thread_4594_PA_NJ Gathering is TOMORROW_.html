March 2, 2002: The Pennsylvania/New Jersey Letterboxing Summit is <br/>
approaching! The good folks on the Yahoo LBNA Discussion Board have decided <br/>
to meet at 4:00pm at the "Fish Passage Way" at the Old Canal Museum off of <br/>
Route 611 in Easton, PA. If the weather is too sloppy, we'll meet at the lobby <br/>
of the Best Western (610-253-9131) just around the corner.<br/>
<br/>
Then, afterwards, we'll all bounce over to the Raubsville Tavern (25 Canal <br/>
Road, off of Route 611, Raubsville, PA, 610-252-2165) for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
How do you get there from New Jersey? Well, just take either Route 22 or <br/>
Route 78 west. As soon as you enter Pennsylvania, you're already there. Click <br/>
here for a map which shows the general area in relation to these highways..<br/>
