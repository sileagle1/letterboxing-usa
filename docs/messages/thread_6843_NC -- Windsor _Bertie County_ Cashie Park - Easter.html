Off of Highway 70 in Windsor, you'll find the lovely little Cashie Park.   http://www.albemarle-nc.com/windsor/attractn/wetwalk.htm -or- <br/>
<a href="http://www.albemarle-nc.com/windsor/attractn/wetwalk.htm">Cashie Wetlands Walk</a>.   "The Walk has an 1800 foot handicapped accessible walkway to the Cashie River and features a fishing pier at its end. The trees and shrubs in the Walk are labeled for identification. Various wild animals can be seen in their natural habitat, many of which are endangered species, such as the pileated woodpecker."<br/>
<br/>
But what you're looking for is the easy to be missed entrance to Cashie Park...(there's a Phillips 66 station nearby across the street).  Once you drive into this fine little park look for logs in the water...there's usually a favorite site of ours there...the turtle club suntans here daily!<br/>
<br/>
Stand under the Cashie Park sign facing towards the park.  Go left towards the water between two trees.  The tree on the left has a hole in it's side.  Stuffed inside (under felt) you'll find "Starry Night".  We put a stick inside the hole to hold the box up...as the side hole is connected to the bottom hole...and would have fallen...which wouldn't be a problem, except this park is prone to flooding.  So please be careful with the re-tucking.<br/>
<br/>
Besides a very special handcarved stamp, inside of "Starry Night" you'll find special souvenirs for the little ones in your group.<br/>
<br/>
If you're so inclined please bring a bag and help with a bit of litter collecting.  This little spot is not being kept up as it deserves to be...and every little bit helps.  Take care.<br/>
