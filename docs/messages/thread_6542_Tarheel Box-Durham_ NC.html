Wake-Tech Community College and suggested to the gather family that we<br/>
find the "Tarheel" letterbox over in Durham. Our other nephew had<br/>
graduated from UNC last year. Although the family has lived in Apex,<br/>
NC for many years, they never really had been to Duke. (that UNC sky<br/>
blue runs deep...)  We had a 17 passenger van available to us for the<br/>
graduation and nine of us, including one year old Dominic,  decided to<br/>
make the trip being as inconspicuous as possible.  We had a great time<br/>
finding the cross country trail....The Duke campus is beautiful....We<br/>
walked along, found the box, and walked up the trail before opening it<br/>
being very careful to not expose what we were doing to any of the<br/>
joggers along the trail.<br/>
<br/>
The tupperware container was badly warped which had allowed water into<br/>
the box but the baggie had kept the journal dry.  The stamp was a<br/>
lovely UNC Tarheel which we stamped and all signed the journal placing<br/>
the box carefully back in the abandoned chimney.  We then went to<br/>
Fosters to have healthy sandwich and then back to Apex to rest and<br/>
prepare for the evening's festivities.<br/>
<br/>
A great time was had by all. Thank you for bringing us to this<br/>
delightful site.<br/>
