High Mountain Preserve Park <br/>
Placed by Wingfoot on 10/20/01<br/>
Wayne, Passaic County, New Jersey<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Easy<br/>
Terrain:    Moderate with one long climb<br/>
Time:    2 to 3 hours <br/>
<br/>
HOW THIS SERIES CAME TO BE<br/>
<br/>
I received a free stamp with an order of inkpads.  The stamp was of a Koala <br/>
Bear.  From that stamp came this series.  There is one home made and four <br/>
manufactured stamps all with an Australian theme.  <br/>
<br/>
NOTES<br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet, as some areas of this park are heavily traveled.<br/>
<br/>
A map of the preserve can be printed from <a href=""><br/>

<br/>
There are literally dozens of unmarked trails here and the blazed trails have <br/>
many abrupt turns.    <br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS<br/>
<br/>
The start point of this series is in Franklin Lakes New Jersey.  From Route <br/>
208 take High Mountain Road to Reservoir Drive.  On Reservoir Drive just <br/>
after the circle in the road on the left is a gated dirt road where this <br/>
series starts.<br/>
<br/>
DOWN UNDER LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Start up the fire road.  The white blazes start just up the trail.  Start on <br/>
white blaze trail. Eventually you'll see a small tree on the left of the <br/>
trail with a blaze on it.  You'll notice two big split trees behind the small <br/>
tree, the farthest tree has four trunks.  From small tree go 3 paces at 90 <br/>
degrees to big split tree.  From that tree go 5 paces 140 degrees to a big <br/>
tree split into four trunks.  In the cavity between the trees trunks under a <br/>
rock is what you're searching for. <br/>
<br/>
KOALA LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Continue along white trail.  You'll pass a tee box at the North Jersey <br/>
Country club.  Stay on trail.  After a sharp left in trail you'll come to a <br/>
sharp right in trail.  Just beyond the right turn (straight up an unmarked <br/>
trail) you'll notice an uprooted tree.  The trees roots jet nine feet in the <br/>
air.  From the roots go 9 paces at 255 degrees to a dead tree with three <br/>
trunks.  In a crevice at the base of the tree is what you're searching for.  <br/>
Use a stick, juts in case.<br/>
<br/>
EMU LETTERBOX     <br/>
<br/>
Go back and pick up white trail.   Eventually you'll reach the red trail.  <br/>
Take right on red trail.  Take yellow trail on left of red trail.  Eventually <br/>
you'll come to a tree on right of trail.  Carved into tree below the blaze is <br/>
"Art is beautiful 4ever".  The planter of this box did not make the carving.  <br/>
