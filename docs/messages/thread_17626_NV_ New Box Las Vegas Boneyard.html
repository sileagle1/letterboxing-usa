State: Nevada<br/>
County: Clark<br/>
Nearest City: Las Vegas<br/>
Planted by realroadrunner<br/>
<br/>
Terrain: Driving and level walking<br/>
Clues: Moderately Easy<br/>
<br/>
Where do the Las Vegas Strip's neon signs go when they're retired? To <br/>
the Neon Museum Boneyard, more formally known as the Young Electric <br/>
Sign Company's Neon Sign Graveyard. The Museum has preserved some of <br/>
the city's past electric glory in a fenced lot. The stockpile <br/>
includes some of the city's bygone landmarks, from the flickering <br/>
remains of a gigantic Silver Slipper to a mammoth Aladdin's lamp.  <br/>
This stamp commemorates old Las Vegas, from the days when, to <br/>
paraphrase architect Robert Venturi, the signs on the Strip were more <br/>
important than the architecture.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  The following clues will take you to the Las Vegas Boneyard so <br/>
you can look over the fence at these marvelous structures, but the <br/>
stamp itself is located in a historic city park approximately 2.6 <br/>
miles away.  The Boneyard is not located exactly in the "best area" <br/>
for letterboxing, you should be safe, however, driving to it, parking <br/>
and getting out of your car to look at the signs.<br/>
<br/>
(If you don't want to sightsee and want to head straight to the <br/>
letterbox, locate the park that contains the former Twin Lakes Lodge <br/>
and jump ahead to Clue 6.)<br/>
<br/>
Clues: <br/>
1.   Find the Vaquero who left his Hacienda and traveled to the north <br/>
end of the Strip.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Half a mile north, turn east on McWilliam.  Admire bygone era. <br/>
<br/>
3.  Return to the Boulevard, keeping the dinosaurs and fort on your <br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Become a leftist for the father of our Country.<br/>
<br/>
5.  Drive 2.6 miles west to a street named for the state flower of <br/>
Louisiana.  Turn left.<br/>
<br/>
6.  Park near the playground and walk west.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Find the tree planted in memory of a heartbreak.<br/>
<br/>
8.  Take 25 steps to a path and walk in a counter-clockwise direction <br/>
(for a short stroll) or clock-wise (for a long oneeither way you'll <br/>
get there!)<br/>
<br/>
9.  Stop where you smell pond water, duck breath and eau de humanbut <br/>
don't rest in this room yet.<br/>
<br/>
10. Go behind the building and line yourself up with a dry waterfall <br/>
with five palms across the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
11. Between you and this waterfall is another set of ruins from the <br/>
old resort.  Below the remaining center post, at the bottom of the <br/>
rock foundation, is what you seek.  If you look behind you, there is <br/>
a grey bench where you can sit and stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
Warning:  Bring gloves, be careful putting your hands into strange <br/>
holes! <br/>
