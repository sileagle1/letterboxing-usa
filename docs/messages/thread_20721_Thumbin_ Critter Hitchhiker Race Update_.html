Pink Pig is in the lead, with mere 70 miles left to her final <br/>
destination! Grab her from the Corazon del Fuego letterbox in <br/>
Danbury, CT, and take to the Big Apple if you want to drive a winner!<br/>
<br/>
Black Bat is rumored to be in New Jersey... Can anyone confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
Blue Cat was last seen in the vicinity of Montecito, CA!<br/>
<br/>
Purple Turtle was last seen in Lake Arrowhead, CA!<br/>
<br/>
Grey Owl was last seen in Northern California!<br/>
<br/>
Tan Dog, Yellow Kangaroo, and Green Hornet seem to be resting on <br/>
their laurels... or playing the tortoise to Pink Pig's hare?<br/>
<br/>
Red Bull and Orange Octopus have been kidnapped. Last seen at their <br/>
starting boxes. If anyone knows of their whereabouts, please let me <br/>
know - I'm very worried about them!<br/>
<br/>
I heard Rosie is in Maine?<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to check my blog for instructions on how to bring a winner to <br/>
the finish line!  -Q   http://hitchhikerrace.blogspot.com<br/>
