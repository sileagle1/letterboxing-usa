                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ditto. If there are pavilions at Riverbend, that's probably the <br/>
closest for Marylanders. Triple V Gang suggested Bull Run, but I <br/>
think that's awfully far out there. I've wanted to get the Scranimals <br/>
at Burke Lake, and a potluck there would at least force me to <br/>
figure out where it is!<br/>

Sunday or Saturday would be great.<br/>
