should learn about boxing as we have been leaving our business cards and a <br/>
note in 35 mm film cans all over the USA. Just to see if anyone was cat <br/>
enough to open them up. We have ridden in 45 states and over two hundred <br/>

to the Mad Stamper, M. Klink and got into this group. We now plan on placing <br/>
boxes where ever we go, our first is in a state game management area near our <br/>
home in Horseheads, NY.  Klink was or has, I haven't checked lately, going to <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW.  from what I understand, this is exactly how letterboxing started a couple of hundred years back, with this guy leaving his calling card at Cranmere Pool on Dartmoor.  Did you know that, or is this just an amazing coincidence.  Sounds like you should be able to find a home away from home with us.  A perfect fit, I'd say.<br/>
<br/>
A question though; was the the town named after you moved there or did you choose to live in Horseheads because it just fit?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
I know lots of input on the list.  Any particular areas you had in mind?<br/>
<br/>
Any chance you might ride your horses up to Killington,VTthe 1st weekend of November?  Tom C. has organized a little letterboxing get together at the Inn at Long Trail (www.innatlongtrail.com)<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to be able to kinda follow along (virtually that is) on your adventures.  Welcome to the hobby!<br/>
