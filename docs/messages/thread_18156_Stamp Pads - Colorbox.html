their convenient size, but also because even though it is water-<br/>

gets wet inside the box.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and just for the record... an ink is either dye or pigment -- <br/>
based on the ink.  You cannot change it from dye to pigment based on <br/>
the binder you use (i.e. glycerine) -- it is still dye-based ink.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; uhm... no they're not. Colorbox makes more than one type of stamp <br/>
&gt; pad and not all of them are pigment based.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My current particular favorite stamp pads are the Colorbox CHALK <br/>
&gt; ones. They are DYE based, not pigment so they dry fast. The colors <br/>
&gt; are fantastic, every single one of the pads are juicy not dry at <br/>
all <br/>
&gt; plus they come in both the standard size and those wonderful small <br/>
&gt; cats eye size that are so good for when your out hiking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; actually, we use all kinds of stamp pads and markers cuz I'm into <br/>
&gt; rubber stamp art and scrapbooking so I already have lots of them <br/>
&gt; around. Repeat after me: re-inkers are your friend! lol<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; if you don't have a re-inker and your stamp pad is dry you can <br/>
bring <br/>
&gt; it back to life by using a 50-50 mix of water and glycerine that <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; apply like you would a re-inker. glycerine is cheap at the <br/>
pharmacy! <br/>
&gt; This will turn your dye pad into something halfway like a pigment <br/>
&gt; pad though so it may take a little longer to dry when you do stamp <br/>
&gt; it so dont close your logbook right away or you might get smearing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the markers I use, I like the Marvy brand brush markers. <br/>
They <br/>
&gt; stay wet longer than most others, they last forever and come in <br/>
&gt; packs that you can use the 40% off coupon for at Michaels. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Using markers: stamp a trial image on the stamp so you know what it <br/>
&gt; looks like then color directly on the stamp putting the colors you <br/>
&gt; want in the areas you want, then hold the stamp near your mouth and <br/>
&gt; HUFF on it to use your warm breath to moisten the dye based marker <br/>
&gt; colors, like you'd do to clean your sunglasses, then stamp the <br/>
image <br/>
&gt; in your logbook. Sometimes you can get more than one image before <br/>
&gt; having to re-color the stamp with markers.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">~ Uhm . . . sorry but Colorbox CHALK pads, in the words of the<br/>
manufacturer:<br/>
<br/>
      "ColorBox Fluid CHALK inks share the resilience of pigment ink<br/>
but stamp and blend like dye ink, drying quickly on absorbent<br/>
surfaces.  Permanent when heat set, they resist smearing, bleeding or<br/>
fading even when air dried." <br/>
<br/>
This is straight from the manufacturer, can't find where the CHALK<br/>
formula claims to be pigment only -- or even pigment partly!  Maybe it<br/>
is, but the manufacturer does not claim it to be so.   <br/>
<br/>
~ The Cat's Eye pads are very nice indeed, they are however not<br/>
restricted to the pigment formula since they are also offered in the<br/>
Colorbox CHALK formula.<br/>
<br/>
~ As far as the ColorBox pigment pads not being permanent without the<br/>
use of a heat gun, test for yourself by moistening a finger then rub<br/>
it across an impression that has air dried.  Mine didn't smear, and<br/>
that is permanent enough for me when making stamp impressions.   <br/>
<br/>
~ Really, any ink pad makes a mess when wet, that's why baggies were<br/>
invented, to contain the mess.  The worst trick to be played on a<br/>
fellow boxer tho, is putting an Ink-It-Up stamp pad in a box.  Those<br/>
things are the cheapest, cruddiest, crappiest inkpads made, filled<br/>
with low quality ink that beads up on the stamp leaving a pitiful<br/>
impression.  That's the best reason to always pack your own supply.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ Oh, just to correct the record . . . pigment is what gives color to<br/>
the ink.  Pigment can be natural or man made, but regardless of its<br/>
origin, for our purposes it is a finely ground substance suspended in<br/>
a liquid.  The vehicle used to suspend the pigment is what determines<br/>
its use and function.  <br/>
<br/>
     The common names printed on inkpads: "Pigment" and "Dye" serve to<br/>
identify the different suspension formulas used and how the ink works<br/>
when used.  I think this is what caused your confusion and is an easy<br/>
mistake to make.  If you wish to further educate yourself on the<br/>
subject, a good place to start would be your local library's reference<br/>
books on painting and printmaking.   <br/>
<br/>
~ Oh, another record to correct . . . the ink used in both "Pigment"<br/>
and "Dye" inkpads are water based and do indeed mix.  Not convinced? <br/>
Try it, press a stamp on a "Pigment" inkpad then on a "Dye" pad then<br/>
make an impression on paper.  See, they do mix.    <br/>

Perhaps <br/>
&gt; I could direct her to you?<br/>

&gt; &gt; ~ Uhm . . . sorry but Colorbox CHALK pads, in the words of the<br/>

&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;       "ColorBox Fluid CHALK inks share the resilience of pigment <br/>
ink<br/>
&gt; &gt; but stamp and blend like dye ink, drying quickly on absorbent<br/>
&gt; &gt; surfaces.  Permanent when heat set, they resist smearing, <br/>
bleeding <br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; fading even when air dried." <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is straight from the manufacturer, can't find where the CHALK<br/>
&gt; &gt; formula claims to be pigment only -- or even pigment partly!  <br/>
Maybe <br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is, but the manufacturer does not claim it to be so.   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ~ The Cat's Eye pads are very nice indeed, they are however not<br/>
&gt; &gt; restricted to the pigment formula since they are also offered in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Colorbox CHALK formula.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ~ As far as the ColorBox pigment pads not being permanent without <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; use of a heat gun, test for yourself by moistening a finger then <br/>
rub<br/>
&gt; &gt; it across an impression that has air dried.  Mine didn't smear, <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; that is permanent enough for me when making stamp impressions.   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ~ Really, any ink pad makes a mess when wet, that's why baggies <br/>
were<br/>
&gt; &gt; invented, to contain the mess.  The worst trick to be played on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fellow boxer tho, is putting an Ink-It-Up stamp pad in a box.  <br/>
Those<br/>
&gt; &gt; things are the cheapest, cruddiest, crappiest inkpads made, filled<br/>
&gt; &gt; with low quality ink that beads up on the stamp leaving a pitiful<br/>
&gt; &gt; impression.  That's the best reason to always pack your own <br/>
&gt; supply.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;      <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ~ Oh, just to correct the record . . . pigment is what gives <br/>
color <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the ink.  Pigment can be natural or man made, but regardless of <br/>
its<br/>
&gt; &gt; origin, for our purposes it is a finely ground substance <br/>
suspended <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; a liquid.  The vehicle used to suspend the pigment is what <br/>
&gt; determines<br/>
&gt; &gt; its use and function.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;      The common names printed on inkpads: "Pigment" and "Dye" <br/>
serve <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; identify the different suspension formulas used and how the ink <br/>
&gt; works<br/>
&gt; &gt; when used.  I think this is what caused your confusion and is an <br/>
&gt; easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; mistake to make.  If you wish to further educate yourself on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; subject, a good place to start would be your local library's <br/>
&gt; reference<br/>
&gt; &gt; books on painting and printmaking.   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ~ Oh, another record to correct . . . the ink used in <br/>
both "Pigment"<br/>
&gt; &gt; and "Dye" inkpads are water based and do indeed mix.  Not <br/>
&gt; convinced? <br/>
&gt; &gt; Try it, press a stamp on a "Pigment" inkpad then on a "Dye" pad <br/>
then<br/>
&gt; &gt; make an impression on paper.  See, they do mix.    <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Uhm...  sorry but Colorbox chalk pads, including the cute litte <br/>
&gt; Cat's <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Eye pads, are all pigment ink.  Furthermore, they are not <br/>
&gt; considered <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be permanent unless heat-set.  Don't know about anyone else, <br/>
&gt; but I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't carry a heat gun when letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Still, the Cat's Eye pads are nice for boxes not only because <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their convenient size, but also because even though it is water-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; based, the chalk ink doesn't seem to make such a slimy mess if <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gets wet inside the box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Oh, and just for the record... an ink is either dye or pigment -<br/>
- <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; based on the ink.  You cannot change it from dye to pigment <br/>
based <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the binder you use (i.e. glycerine) -- it is still dye-based <br/>
ink.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All Colorbox pads are pigment based so take much longer to <br/>
&gt; dry <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be a messy choice for placing in a letterbox.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uhm... no they're not. Colorbox makes more than one type of <br/>
&gt; stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pad and not all of them are pigment based.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My current particular favorite stamp pads are the Colorbox <br/>
&gt; CHALK <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ones. They are DYE based, not pigment so they dry fast. The <br/>
&gt; colors <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are fantastic, every single one of the pads are juicy not dry <br/>
&gt; at <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plus they come in both the standard size and those wonderful <br/>
&gt; small <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cats eye size that are so good for when your out hiking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually, we use all kinds of stamp pads and markers cuz I'm <br/>
&gt; into <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rubber stamp art and scrapbooking so I already have lots of <br/>
&gt; them <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around. Repeat after me: re-inkers are your friend! lol<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if you don't have a re-inker and your stamp pad is dry you <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bring <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it back to life by using a 50-50 mix of water and glycerine <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apply like you would a re-inker. glycerine is cheap at the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pharmacy! <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This will turn your dye pad into something halfway like a <br/>
&gt; pigment <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pad though so it may take a little longer to dry when you do <br/>
&gt; stamp <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it so dont close your logbook right away or you might get <br/>
&gt; smearing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As for the markers I use, I like the Marvy brand brush <br/>
markers. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; They <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stay wet longer than most others, they last forever and come <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; packs that you can use the 40% off coupon for at Michaels. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Using markers: stamp a trial image on the stamp so you know <br/>
&gt; what it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks like then color directly on the stamp putting the <br/>
colors <br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; want in the areas you want, then hold the stamp near your <br/>
mouth <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; HUFF on it to use your warm breath to moisten the dye based <br/>
&gt; marker <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; colors, like you'd do to clean your sunglasses, then stamp <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; image <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in your logbook. Sometimes you can get more than one image <br/>
&gt; before <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; having to re-color the stamp with markers.<br/>
