I have received payment for logo patch orders from:<br/>
Campbell (3), Fields (4), Allen (1), Glasco (1), Babb (5) &amp; RJRW (10)<br/>
<br/>
The total is up to   24 received.  Have I missed anybody?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Its looks like we are getting closer everyday!   If you want a patch, now would be a good time to order it.  <br/>
<br/>
Remember, it takes 4 to 6 weeks to get the patches once I have made the order so if anyone wants their patches by Christmas time NOW would be the best time to send your orders to me.<br/>

mostly this is for fun   but yes... if you see someone with one of these patches or a window decal on the car in the parking area, you can be sure you have encountered a letterboxer.  :o)
