                    <div class="plaintext-content">We haven't written a letterboxing message in a very long time, but when we recently heard that Rubaduc of CT got her 10,000th "traditional" letterbox find just this past November, we felt that we just had to give her a big cheer here!  We are happy indeed to induct her, as only the third person ever that we know of in North American letterboxing history, to our "F10K Club", a fun little personal goal-oriented challenge that we started on our own website way back in the summer of 2001. Of course, back then the first goal was PFX 500, because there were scarcely that many letterboxes in the whole country! We still remember how some folks on LbNA  (this was years before the advent of AQ) thought it was some kind of joke, and that hardly anyone in this country would ever be able to find 500 boxes. Nowadays, of course, people in many parts of the country can, with a modicum of effort, find that many boxes in a single month! However, the fact remains that, for the earliest letterboxers, this was a real challenge, so were pleased to keep track of people chronologically reaching that goal over the course of the early LbNA/ pre-AQ years, and we added bigger goals as more boxes became available ( this list is currently located at the bottom of our index page at http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html , and is still open to anyone who cares to give us the dates that they reached any particular goal.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back when we started our  "PFX Clubs", what we did wasn't called "traditional letterboxing". It was calledwell, just plain old <br/>
"letterboxing"!  Putting the word "traditional" in front of letterboxing was just a fairly recent "AQ thing" to distinguish "letterboxing", as it was practiced in earlier years in this country, from the myriad of "stamp collecting activities" that  AQ seemed to be later promoting. At any rate, we have sometimes been known to put the word "traditional" in quotes as a sort of joke to poke fun at AQ (like, duh - what other type of letterboxing is there?  Certainly none that WE would consider to be letterboxing!) It is amusing to see that several other folks are now putting "traditional" in quotes, too, but for a slightly different reason: to poke fun at all those stamps in recent years "growing on trees", tables, cars, etc., that have nothing to do with the traditional North American letterboxing experience, but are still getting listed as "traditionals". So, now it seems that we have not just one, but two ways of poking fun at the use of the word "traditional" as applied to letterboxing"!<br/>
<br/>
To get back to Rubaduc, however, now there was a true "traditional" letterboxer of the finest sort!  Not only did she start out in letterboxing at a time when long hikes for a single box were still the norm, but she continued that tradition long after it became less popular, when more and more people began resorting to just the "quick fix" of stamp gatherings. For many years Rubaduc quietly continued to plant boxes on lovely hikes on the Q .T. (Quinnipiac, Tunxis, and other blue-blazed trails in CT), as well as sharing new preserves in CT along with her many "castles"  and other adventures. Even after illness set in, she continued to climb her beloved hills of CT, as recently as last fall, when we saw her stamped in at several places along the NET (New England Trail), where few other letterboxes have yet ventured. Granted, she told us recently that she has now had to quit the hikes and only "go along for the ride", but for many years, Rubaduc was known for getting right out there at the first sign of a new letterbox anywhere in central CT!  She may not be quite so well known outside CT, since she made relatively few letterboxing forays outside her native state, but certainly in CT, it was a real "tradition" to see her stamped in most everywhere we went! So, Rubaduc, for all the hard work you put into letterboxing for so many years, we salute you! And since we also established  the "tradition" of having a "10K Party" when we reached F i0, 000 (in 2006 and 2008 respectively), we hope that you will be having a big F10K celebration soon, too - you deserve one!<br/>

We still remember how some folks on LbNA  (this was years before the advent of AQ) thought it was some kind of joke, and that hardly anyone in this country would ever be able to find 500 boxes. Nowadays, of course, people in many parts of the country can, with a modicum of effort, find that many boxes in a single month! However, the fact remains that, for the earliest letterboxers, this was a real challenge, so were pleased to keep track of people chronologically reaching that goal over the course of the early LbNA/ pre-AQ years, and we added bigger goals as more boxes became available ( this list is currently located at the bottom of our index page at http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html , and is still open to anyone who cares to give us the dates that they reached any particular goal.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, back when we started our  "PFX Clubs", what we did wasn't called "traditional letterboxing". It was calledwell, just plain old <br/>
&gt; "letterboxing"!  Putting the word "traditional" in front of letterboxing was just a fairly recent "AQ thing" to distinguish "letterboxing", as it was practiced in earlier years in this country, from the myriad of "stamp collecting activities" that  AQ seemed to be later promoting. At any rate, we have sometimes been known to put the word "traditional" in quotes as a sort of joke to poke fun at AQ (like, duh - what other type of letterboxing is there?  Certainly none that WE would consider to be letterboxing!) It is amusing to see that several other folks are now putting "traditional" in quotes, too, but for a slightly different reason: to poke fun at all those stamps in recent years "growing on trees", tables, cars, etc., that have nothing to do with the traditional North American letterboxing experience, but are still getting listed as "traditionals". So, now it seems that we have not just one, but two ways of poking fun at the use of the word "traditional" as applied to letterboxing"!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To get back to Rubaduc, however, now there was a true "traditional" letterboxer of the finest sort!  Not only did she start out in letterboxing at a time when long hikes for a single box were still the norm, but she continued that tradition long after it became less popular, when more and more people began resorting to just the "quick fix" of stamp gatherings. For many years Rubaduc quietly continued to plant boxes on lovely hikes on the Q .T. (Quinnipiac, Tunxis, and other blue-blazed trails in CT), as well as sharing new preserves in CT along with her many "castles"  and other adventures. Even after illness set in, she continued to climb her beloved hills of CT, as recently as last fall, when we saw her stamped in at several places along the NET (New England Trail), where few other letterboxes have yet ventured. Granted, she told us recently that she has now had to quit the hikes and only "go along for the ride", but for many years, Rubaduc was known for getting right out there at the first sign of a new letterbox anywhere in central CT!  She may not be quite so well known outside CT, since she made relatively few letterboxing forays outside her native state, but certainly in CT, it was a real "tradition" to see her stamped in most everywhere we went! So, Rubaduc, for all the hard work you put into letterboxing for so many years, we salute you! And since we also established  the "tradition" of having a "10K Party" when we reached F i0, 000 (in 2006 and 2008 respectively), we hope that you will be having a big F10K celebration soon, too - you deserve one!<br/>

&gt; We haven't written a letterboxing message in a very long time, but when we recently heard that Rubaduc of CT got her 10,000th "traditional" letterbox find just this past November, we felt that we just had to give her a big cheer here!
