OTHER side this morning!<br/>
<br/>
She may not be talking about boxes in the WOODS.  She may be <br/>
planting mostly urban, like me.  I'll admit I am not be the best <br/>
hider in the world, but I am getting better and was never all that <br/>
bad.  But when you hide in the city, you find that the places that <br/>
are most out of the way are also the places that homeless people <br/>
tend to congregate in at night during bad weather.  I've had at <br/>
least one of my MIA boxes fall prey to this very fact, and my <br/>
daughter has one also.  Another of my MIA boxes disappeared when the <br/>
dock under which it was well hidden, in a park right on the LSU <br/>
campus, got torn down and rebuilt.  Another on the LSU campus was <br/>
well hidden under an ice machine - which got moved during <br/>
construction.<br/>
<br/>
It's not always a case of poor hiding - just the nature of the sport <br/>
when you engage in urban letterboxing.  I figure a box that lasts 6 <br/>
months is doing well.  I can live with that.  Urban letterboxing has <br/>
it's own, unique, pleasures different from trail letterboxing both <br/>
for the hider and the finder.<br/>
<br/>
So there!<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
Zed (who's not really sure which side of the bed SHE got up on this <br/>
morning!)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let's face it, if you are losing half of the boxes you are hiding <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; shouldn't be hiding boxes at all. You give us all a bad name and <br/>
&gt; maybe you should take up another past time. When someone finds <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; box in the woods they don't think of it as anything but litter, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; dispose of it properly, save them the time.<br/>

[Picturing Zed walking around campus discreetly reaching under every <br/>
ice machine in sight &amp; trying not to spit my lunch all over my <br/>
keyboard.]<br/>

Thank you Zed for pointing out the differences between the urban <br/>
jungle &amp; the woodsy one!  :)<br/>
