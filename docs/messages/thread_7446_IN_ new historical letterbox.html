"They also serve who stand and watch."<br/>
<br/>
This historical letterbox commemorates the approximately 90 community<br/>
volunteers who during the Korean War in 1952 participated in Operation<br/>
Skywatch by alternating 24-hour shifts to watch for enemy planes from<br/>
a 3-story tower since there was no national radar system.<br/>
<br/>
Begin your journey in West Lafayette IN at Highway 52 (aka Sagamore<br/>
Pkwy West) and Salisbury St. At this intersection is a Walgreen's, CVS<br/>
Pharmacy and a TCBY. Head north on Salisbury St. At 1.1 miles is the<br/>
intersection of Salisbury and Kalberer St. and the 2nd red light.<br/>
Continue north and from this point on, Salisbury becomes County Farm<br/>
Road North 50 West. At 3.2 miles, you will pass Harrison High School<br/>
on your right and Burnett Creek Elementary School on your left. At 5<br/>
miles, the road turns left and becomes 725 North, and at 5.5 miles,<br/>
the road turns right and becomes 100 West. At 6.5 miles, there is a<br/>
small intersection with two white houses and a dead-end right turn<br/>
onto 850 North. Take a right onto the dead-end 850 North. You'll see a<br/>
3-story, run-down, wooden tower. Park next to the tower. You'll see a<br/>
flag, a black historical marker and a monument dedicated to Operation<br/>
Skywatch for those who "stood and watched". Leaning against the<br/>
monument is a white wooden sigh with "Operation Skywatch" in black<br/>
lettering. Behind this sign near the base of the monument is the Cairo<br/>
Skywatch Tower Letterbox.<br/>
