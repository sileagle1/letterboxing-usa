&gt; Thinking of putting letters on the back of my pickup truck spelling<br/>
&gt; leterboxing.org and having a silk screened tee shirt with the same on<br/>
&gt; it....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the dog info...by the way, we made iron-on LBNA t shirts for the <br/>
festival that we just attended. I used the patch logo from the website and it <br/>
came out nifty. We used iron-on paper for the computer printer (especially for <br/>
dark colored shirts) from Staples (office supply store).<br/>
<br/>
They were just washed and stood up to the test.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to take an image of the shirts and post it to the site.<br/>
