<br/>
If there is not already an F-100 stamp, I'd like to carve one to be sent to anyone that has found 100 boxes (not PFX 100, sorry). How you count those finds is up to you. It will be an open list, so people can add their name as they reach that milestone, but I have a feeling it will have a lot of stops at first. I would encourage people to have F-100 parties for people in their area to get as many stamps in per stop as possible :-) Another excuse for a gathering! <br/>
<br/>
As soon as I get an answer that there isn't a stamp already, I can start taking addresses. If that's the case, PLEASE send your full mailing address only to me (not the whole list- that's not a safe thing to do). My email is: DogScouts @ hotmail dot com<br/>

If there is no F-100 stamp already and anyone objects to one being created, simply don't send me your address and you won't get the stamp. :-)<br/>
