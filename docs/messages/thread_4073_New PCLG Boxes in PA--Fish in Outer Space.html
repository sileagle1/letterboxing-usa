Box #13-15: Fish in Outer Space<br/>
Location: Allentown, Pennsylvania<br/>
Difficulty: 1/5 stars; Easy, 3-mile hike with some moderate grades; boxes <br/>
require small climbs up rocky areas.<br/>
Clue page: http://www.pcdx.com/pclg/clue13.htm<br/>
<br/>
This is a series of three boxes, all found on the same circuit hike.<br/>
<br/>
The hike begins at the Planet Walk in Allentown, Pennsylvania (click here for <br/>
information or click here to get directions from Yahoo! Maps).<br/>
<br/>
Box #1:<br/>
<br/>
Start at the Sun. Walk along the path until you come to a planet with a <br/>
diameter of 31,765 miles. From the sign, walk eight paces at 135 degrees to a <br/>
pile of rocks; the box is hidden underneath one of the loose stones.<br/>
<br/>
Box #2:<br/>
<br/>
Continue along the Planet Walk for another billion miles. Look for the tree <br/>
commemorating Phil (10-15-86). From the tree, walk twenty paces at 120 <br/>
degrees to the two trees attached at the base. Behind this tree is a fallen log, <br/>
under which you'll find the second box.<br/>
<br/>
Box #3:<br/>
<br/>
Want to see how fish are manufactured?<br/>
<br/>
After you've walked a total of almost four billion miles, you'll come to the <br/>
last planet. Continue along the path and cross the road (you will pass Bogert's <br/>
Bridge--the big red one with the roof--on your right). The trail will then <br/>
continue along the Little Lehigh Creek. At one point, you will have an option of <br/>
staying on the bridle path or veering off to the right; either option is fine, as <br/>
they reconnect a little farther down. We recommend the path on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on this path until you come to Fish Hatchery Road, then make a right and <br/>
walk along the road for a few feet. Then, make another right and take a few <br/>
minutes to feed the fishies at the Lil Le-Hi Trout Nursery.<br/>
<br/>
Behind the fish tanks, you'll see a sign for a nature trail. Take this trail up the <br/>
hill and through the woods. Right before you cross the wooden bridge, make a <br/>
left (the sign behind you says "Nature Loop 2"). Then, you'll see a familiar <br/>
bridge with enormous white columns. But, this time, there's a box to be found! <br/>
Walk to the first column at the base of the arch, then count two more columns <br/>
towards the northwest. Then, count the fourth column (from the end) in that <br/>
row. The treasure is under a rock at its base.<br/>
<br/>
To complete your journey, get back on the trail and continue along, underneath <br/>
the bridge. Soon, you'll pass by Bogert's Bridge, and eventually you can cross <br/>
Kline's bridge to return to your starting point.<br/>
