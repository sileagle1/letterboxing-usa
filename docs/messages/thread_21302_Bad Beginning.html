Those durned Baudelaire orphans--we traipsed all the way out to go <br/>
rescue them, but, alas, it wasn't meant to be.  We were so <br/>
disappointed!  Along the trek, we thought we saw some dreadful <br/>
sights floating along the shore at dead man's cove.  When we <br/>
investigated it more closely we realized it wasn't really the bodies <br/>
of Klaus, Violet and Sunny but rather 3 'buoys' tumbling in the surf <br/>
instead. Thank goodness--that meant there was still hope we might be <br/>
able to save them.  Further along the trek, it seemed that Count <br/>
Olaf's cape'd shadow suddenly loomed overhead.  Fearing the worst of <br/>
all imaginable outcomes, we darted into a nearby loo and hid from <br/>
the ominous shadow until the danger passed.  Unfortunately, by the <br/>
time we arrived at the X on the map, there was no sign of the <br/>
orphans but rather a disintegrating tree and water, water--water as <br/>
far as the eye could see!  Thank goodness we avoided the perilous <br/>
cliffs just a bit ahead.  Fortunately, the remnants still contained <br/>
in the box were high &amp; dry; exactly how Count Olaf left us--with the <br/>
orphans dreadfully in tow, I fear.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, the orphans are still in grave danger.  Hopefully, that <br/>
doesn't mean 'interred', which is this sense means buried deep into <br/>
the ground someplace.<br/>
<br/>
Miserably,<br/>
