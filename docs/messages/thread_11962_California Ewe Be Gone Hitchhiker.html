I'm so happy to hear about this Letterbox (Magu Peak, I assume)--I <br/>
didn't see it listed on the LBNA Website. I don't live so far from <br/>
this location, but might have shied away from this LB because of its <br/>
age. I've had some bad experiences with older LBs lately, and would <br/>
hate to take a 4 hour hike with nothing to show for it (okay, I <br/>
would've had a lovely hike, but still...). Now that I know the LB is <br/>
still there, I'll make the trip in the next couple of weeks; of <br/>
course, I'm sure your Hitchhiker will be gone by then.<br/>
