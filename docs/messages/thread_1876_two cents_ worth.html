There are alot of good ideas floating around about the merit badges <br/>
and more good ideas come into the discussion every day. Even though <br/>
Kay has invited and considered input from the group on this, I sense <br/>
there is some kind of urgency here. (OK, maybe it's just enthusiasm.) <br/>
But please, let's not rush into a merit badge design before there's <br/>
been ample time to consider all the options.<br/>
<br/>
Jeremy Disch: I feel your idea of one single merit badge containing <br/>
all the P and F denominations was a really good one. (See post <br/>
#4947). That way a person orders one single patch and cuts it up as <br/>
needed. No waiting to order the next denomination, one time <br/>
shipping/handling charge. Simple, clean, one-shot deal. <br/>
Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be what's evolving here.<br/>
<br/>
Kay Mohmers: Needless to say, without your enthusiasm and initiative, <br/>
the whole patch and decal effort might not have even gotten off the <br/>
ground. Along with the original designers of the LbNA logo, you too <br/>
are to be commended for being instrumental in giving this group <br/>
the "identifying symbol" that so many of us have wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all know that the gift of letterboxing is that it is <br/>
something different to everyone: an artistic outlet for the stamp <br/>
carvers, a social diversion, fresh air and exercise, an intellectual <br/>
clue-solving challenge, cherished family time, an ego-booster, and <br/>
the peacefulness of nature, to name a few.<br/>
<br/>
For me, it's never quite been about "racking up the numbers". So <br/>
you'll forgive me if I've little to offer in the way of merit badge <br/>
ideas. It's just that the logo patches and decals came out so good, <br/>
it would be prudent to give the merit badge initiative **plenty** of <br/>
time to develop and reach a consensus.<br/>

<br/>
I'm with Val.  I've ordered several of the regular logo patches, but I'm not<br/>
too much into the numbers game.  At the same time, though, a little healthy<br/>
competition adds to the fun, especially for kids, I've noticed.  It adds a<br/>
sense of excitement.  Offering the denomination patches is a good idea for<br/>
the young 'uns, but to be honest, you probably won't get any orders for them<br/>
out of me (though you never know...gifts for grandkids, etc., once things<br/>
get a little warmer around here).<br/>
<br/>
