Eagerly awaiting a reply, <br/>
The Count c/o Sesame Street.<br/>
<br/>
Well Count,<br/>
<br/>
If I found it, I count it as an F, even if I found it in my mailbox <br/>
or included in another box.<br/>
<br/>
If I placed it, I count it as a P, even if I placed it in a mailbox, <br/>
an established box or in the hand of another boxer as an HH.  (I <br/>
don't believe the way a stamp is passed into the LB community should <br/>
detract from the size of your P-ness.)<br/>
<br/>
The only ones I don't include in my P or F count are exchanges, <br/>
travellers and event stamps.<br/>
<br/>
For my own obsessive sake, I DO keep track of which F's happen to be <br/>
HH and Mystery, .......in case there's an audit. But my P-ness is <br/>
publicly displayed with my F-ness at wwwDOTpoisonivyDOT150mDOTcom<br/>
