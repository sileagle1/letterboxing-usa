There was a box there at one point under a drinking fountain. But it <br/>
was pulled due to some letterboxers who were not discrete. As far as <br/>
I know the box has not been replaced due to hightened security in our <br/>
nation's capital. <br/>
There are plenty of other boxes in walking distance of the 'Mall' <br/>
area though. <br/>
