                    <div class="plaintext-content">FIRST ANNUAL (southern) NEW JERSEY LETTERBOXING<br/>
GATHERING<br/>
<br/>
DATE:			October 26, 2003	(Sunday)	(Rain or Shine -<br/>
covered pavilion)<br/>
TIME:			Approximately 11 am  3 pm<br/>
WHERE:		PAKIM POND<br/>
			  Brendan T. Byrne State Forest (formerly Lebanon<br/>
State Forest)<br/>
			Shinns Road (off Route 72), New Lisbon, NJ 08064<br/>
<br/>
*RSVP*:		Please, no later than Wednesday, October 22,<br/>
2003<br/>
<br/>
Terrain:	From parking lot to pavilion is packed dirt. <br/>
Pavilion floor is cement.  Trails are packed dirt,<br/>
little bit rooty.  **Some trails specifically marked<br/>
wheel chair accessible.**<br/>
<br/>
Your Cost:		A Pot Luck dish please, hot or cold<br/>
<br/>
Bathrooms:		yes	Handicap friendly<br/>
<br/>
Events:			Exchanges, exchanges and more exchanges. <br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Event Boxes:	There will be several event boxes hidden<br/>
just for this gathering.  There are several other<br/>
permanent boxes within approximately 10 miles of this<br/>
event.	<br/>
<br/>
Exhibits:	Does anyone want to volunteer their services<br/>
to teach stamp carving, log book making or an advanced<br/>
rubber stamp technique?<br/>
<br/>
Requirements:	Please bring your own BBQ utensils,<br/>
charcoal and ice, if needed.  They do have soda<br/>
machines there.  There are 6 picnic tables and 6<br/>
charcoal grills (unless severe dry (drought)<br/>
conditions are in effect).  Alcoholic beverages are<br/>
prohibited in this park.  Furred animals or pets are<br/>
prohibited from buildings, bathing areas, all camping<br/>
areas and over night facilities.  Unduly annoying<br/>
conduct is prohibited.  All firearms of any kind are<br/>
strictly prohibited.  Not my rules  the state park<br/>
rules.<br/>
<br/>
Goal:	To bring as many southern New Jersey letterboxes<br/>
together to form some sort of group, club or social to<br/>
make more people aware of this cool hobby.  To plan<br/>
monthly weekend hunts with other south Jersey<br/>
letterboxers.  The pavilion is costing me to rent it<br/>
for the day.  If enough people come to the gathering<br/>
and are serious in starting a group we can organize a<br/>
way or take donations to have more gatherings in the<br/>
future.  Because anywhere we hold the next gathering<br/>
we will have to pay for the site if we want similar<br/>
facilities.  So please try and come out to this<br/>
gathering and lets try to make this group work.  (Any<br/>
and all suggestions welcomed)  See you there.<br/>
<br/>
Coordinator:		letterboxing (Bev)<br/>
I will bring paper plates, cups and napkins.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:		  Brendan T. Byrne State Forest<br/>
<br/>
Please help keep our Pinelands clean<br/>
<br/>

likely (99.9% sure) be there. It's only about an hour from us. <br/>
Personally, I can't wait to meet some fellow boxers. We only have two <br/>
exchanges, and those meetings only lasted a few minutes. It'll be <br/>
nice to sit down and talk to some fellow boxers for awhile. <br/>
<br/>
I encourage anyone in the area (not just in NJ, but also in PA and <br/>
DE) to come out for a day of fun. <br/>
<br/>
Exchanges, letterboxes, and food! What could be better?!  <br/>

PS-I've been told I make a mean rice krispies treats. And I've been <br/>
known to make them in various shapes too. Hmmmmmmm, I wonder what I <br/>
could come up with for a 'boxing theme......  :)<br/>
