There is going to be a gathering of letterboxers held in Maryland (Columbia) on Jan 18th.   Would be a nice way to meet a bunch of us in person.   Keep an eye on the list for more info.  <br/>

&gt;Hello All!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I just thought that I would introduce myself. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I live in Maryland and came across the letterboxing.org website <br/>
&gt;purely by accident.  I was actually searching for rubber stamps. I <br/>
&gt;read about this sport and it sounds very exciting and intriguing.  I <br/>
&gt;have always loved treasure hunting.  So combining treasure hunting <br/>
&gt;with stamping is perfect! **smile**<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have printed out the clues for DC and the Baltimore area in <br/>
&gt;Maryland.  I figured that I would hunt boxes before deciding where to <br/>
&gt;place a new one. **smile**<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Everyone have a great holiday season!  Cheers ... Oakleaf<br/>

in Columbia, MD at Clydes across from the Columbia Mall. I believe <br/>
the time is from 11:30 to 3:30. Firefly is our resident social <br/>
director and has reserved the Library Room for our growing gathering. <br/>
She will be taking a head count in early January. <br/>
