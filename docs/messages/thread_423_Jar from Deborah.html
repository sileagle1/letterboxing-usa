a good possibility.  Its one of those ones with the clamp on lid<br/>
(like sometimes come with cashews in them), but its plastic, not<br/>
glass.  I have it submerged in water and it does not appear to be<br/>
leaking.  Also, it looks as tho the metal clasp may be made of<br/>
stainless steel (which does not readily corrode).  I'll let you<br/>
know about the results of my test.  I've yet to find a container<br/>
where both the lid and the jar survived the hammer test though.<br/>
I'm not going to try the hammer test on this one as its the only<br/>
one I have.  I'm going to put a stamp in it instead.  Besides, I<br/>
don't think strength is as important a factor as water-tightness.<br/>
