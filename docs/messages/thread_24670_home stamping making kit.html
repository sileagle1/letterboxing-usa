                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW!  I just saw this "make it at home stamp kit" being <br/>
demonstrated.  It's a really cool product that turns any image or <br/>
photo into a polymer stamp, without carving.  It's really pretty <br/>
expensive, and I can't really see using it for letterboxing, but it's <br/>
fun to watch.  I'd still much rather hand carve my own stamps, but I <br/>
thought I'd share the video if anyone was interested in seeing <br/>
it.  Maybe some people that "can't carve" would be interested in this <br/>
for making custom stamps, rather than store-bought.<br/>
<br/>
http://crafttvweekly.com  The video should be on the main page, but <br/>
if not search for Tricia Morris and find the video titled "stamp your art out".<br/>
