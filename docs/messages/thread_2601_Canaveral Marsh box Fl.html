&gt;Canaveral Letterbox is in for repairs....This must be why I couldnt<br/>
&gt;find it on 6/15!! Duh!  Well, I was out of town and am behind on my<br/>
&gt;email.  It was definitely Muggy when I hiked out there and the Smoke<br/>
&gt;from the fires in Florida was very bad that morning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I definitely recommend the ziplock bags.  It helps tremendously to<br/>
&gt;keep things dry (I'm from Seattle and know about moist weather)<br/>

I am very sorry you searched for the box while it was out for <br/>
repairs. I had hoped to avoid that by my posting but I feared someone <br/>
might miss the posting. I will not have a chance to place it back <br/>
again until next tuesday (6-26). I will post when it is back in place.<br/>
