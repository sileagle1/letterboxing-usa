<br/>
Shasta (3 miles West of Redding's city limits)<br/>
Shasta County<br/>
California<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Take I-5 to Redding, head West on CA 299 approximately <br/>
10 miles to Shasta SH Park.  Park near the Courthouse Museum.<br/>
<br/>
Note:  This is a micro-letterbox (35 mm film canister), please bring <br/>
stamp &amp; a pen.  Also bring red, green &amp; black markers for added <br/>
stamping effect. You might be able to get a map from the Courthouse.<br/>
<br/>
History:  "Queen City of the Northern Mines" once considered was <br/>
she. "Boom to Bust" best describes her interesting history.  <br/>
Prospects of gold brought miners from all around, for here in 1848 <br/>
Pierson B. Reading found gold in the ground.  Soon Main St was <br/>
teeming with building and sound, tragically twice, 1852 &amp; 1853, they <br/>
mostly burned to the ground.  Soon buildings of brick replaced those <br/>
that were lost, the settlers stoically, quickly bearing <br/>
insurmountable cost.  Unfortunate though, not much treasure was <br/>
found, for the only bloke who made a fortune seems to be the <br/>
hotelier/supplier in town.<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  The bear on the Courthouse is where your trek begins, head E <br/>
to the Pioneer Plaque honoring those who "held the ribbons".  Past 3 <br/>
trees and a snag NW you now go, then N through the fence, to the <br/>
kiosk for info.  Next NE toward the barn, the baler, press &amp; core <br/>
drill view.  Shasta # m.? No, I'm already here, very much thank you!  <br/>
Tallow pots, freight wagons, an iron penguin, how odd? Next head <br/>
around to the left, past arrasta stones, rock sled &amp; feed wagon you <br/>
now trod.  From its SW corner, toward 240 you bear, past an <br/>
interesting tree, a fountain of sorts and cross following two white <br/>
parallel lines with much care.  Sam Isaac's blacksmith shop is the <br/>
first you will see, if in the right place is where you are <br/>
currently.  Next to Madam Gavand's Hotel Francaise for a rest, then <br/>
head E to Reading Springs if you know what is best.  Need some <br/>
hardware? Or Meat? Or other items too? No, instead, 150 degrees from <br/>
Callaghan's follow the trail o' ruins to see something new.  When <br/>
choices you see, first straight, left, left and down, as you wind <br/>
your way further through this wild old ghost town.  Head through the <br/>
doorway of Spatz' circa 1854 bakery, and what in its midst could you <br/>
possibly see?  For within the iron cart on its side, under its SE <br/>
corner hanging, is where I reside.<br/>
