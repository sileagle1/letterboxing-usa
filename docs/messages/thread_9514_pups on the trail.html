&gt;This is why I am glad I only have dogs :-) LOL They don't care if I have a <br/>
&gt;family stamp or use theirs &amp; I'm the only one able to stamp in, so.... <br/>
&gt;Often they do  ALL want to be in the lead though :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Scoutdogs<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No matter what, they fight:  about who found what, who stamped first last<br/>
&gt;time, who gets to put it back, whose turn is it to be in front, who gets to<br/>
&gt;be near Daddy, your turn was longer, this box was bigger,  the color ink <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;stamped with is better than the color I got, you looked at the log book<br/>
&gt;longer than me, etc..  (This is when I close my eyes &amp; take a breath)  We <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;lucky to be together, healthy and doing something wonderfully interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regards,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yeah, but that SOMEONE spent a long time training his/her dog to do <br/>
track scents. Getting performance like that takes a lot of patience <br/>
and tenacity. I worked on those skills with my last dog, a Siberian <br/>
Husky. After all the Companion Dog exercises, Utility skills became <br/>
more of game which we didn't take seriously. She wasn't inclined <br/>
towards it -- but she loved pulling me up steep hills!<br/>
<br/>
We're just beginning with Cleo, but since we really only "borrow" her <br/>
to hike with (she belongs to my adult daughter), I really am not able <br/>
to spend the time in that kind of training. But, she does have <br/>
potential....when she sniffs the box (even after WE find it) I always <br/>
praise her lavishly.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>You didn't think you could have a subject line like "pups on the trail" without getting my attention did you? Molly sometimes finds a box before we get to it but she also tends to get her nose into everything. Very curious about everything I'm doing. Got to push her head away from the ink pad, log book etc. She does find small paths, old foundations, water, people etc. By her body language you can usually tell what she found. You have to be close to your dog and think a bit like a dogs point of view. There is nothing better than a hike with your dog. I also don't depend on my dog for protection or help. She is with me for a walk. She is at a place I took her to. I am there for her protection and to watch over her. Well, enough about dogs, I could just keep going on.
