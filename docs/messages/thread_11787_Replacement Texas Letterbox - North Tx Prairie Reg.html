Lake Somerville is located just north of Brenham, Texas.  The lake <br/>
offers camping, fishing, horse and hiking trails.  Facilities include <br/>
showers, boat ramp, fishing pier, and horse corrals.  There are 2 <br/>
state parks on the lake, Nails Creek Unit and Birch Creek Unit.  Also <br/>
other park for camping such as this one.  Brenham is a great town to <br/>
stroll around, and the surrounding area is beautiful in the spring <br/>
when the bluebonnets bloom.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
<br/>
The "Somer Fly" letterbox is located in Rock Creek Park, northwest of <br/>
Brehman.  From Brenham, take Hwy 36 toward Waco.  Turn left on FM <br/>
1948, and watch for the entrance to Rock Creek on your right in about <br/>
4 or 5 miles.  Turn right and enter through pay station (let them <br/>
know you are not camping, just checking out the park).  Once past, <br/>
continue on the main road past the "Boat Ramp" sign, on to the dump <br/>
station on your left.  Park near the map board.  <br/>
