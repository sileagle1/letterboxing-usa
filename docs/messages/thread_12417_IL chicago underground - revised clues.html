                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the tip moofie &amp; blaze! That area has been "under<br/>
construction" for about 2 years (Chicago: "the city that works") -<br/>
looks like the work finally started the day you got there. Its still<br/>
possible to continue on to the letterbox through that section, but the<br/>
signs are all mixed up during the construction, so I had to ask<br/>
someone how to get through. The clues below are revised just a bit to<br/>
reflect the new route through the construction area...<br/>
<br/>
Clues<br/>
Start at the Michigan Avenue bridge. Follow the stairs half way down<br/>
to the Wendella Boat Landing. Here you will find an entrance to the<br/>
Chicago Underground system of streets.<br/>
<br/>
Entering the portal, continue in this direction for two short blocks<br/>
to a place to get something to eat, something to eat, something to eat<br/>
and drink.<br/>
<br/>
With a full belly to sustain you on your hike, now you are ready. Look<br/>
for a staircase nearby. Stand on the stairs, facing down the<br/>
staircase, and walk in this direction. Continue on and over the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
After you have crossed the bridge, look to your left for a passage<br/>
which starts between 111 and 333. Follow this all the way until it<br/>
ends, where you will find a door.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the hall, headed for the south shore. On the platform, look for<br/>
an exit back out to the street.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the left-hand sidewalk very nearly to the end of the colonnade,<br/>
where you will find the box hidden at the base of a pillar.<br/>
<br/>
A few caveats for this box: Please remember that this is an urban<br/>
letterbox. The underground passageways you will follow are all public<br/>
passages. They are not dangerous, but you should be alert and aware of<br/>
your surroundings. A sizeable number of people have made their homes<br/>
in the Chicago Underground since the 1930s. If you do not bother them<br/>
they will not bother you. The letterbox is not hidden in an area where<br/>
you might intrude upon these people. Please be very discrete in your<br/>
search for the letterbox. With all the current fears of mysterious<br/>
packages hidden in high-traffic areas, it is imperative that you keep<br/>
the existence and location of this letterbox a secret. Once you find<br/>
it, you may want to move away from the immediate area to stamp up.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
