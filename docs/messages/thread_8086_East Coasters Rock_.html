                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a fabulous weekend.  This was much better than being eaten alive <br/>
by mosquitoes!  <br/>
<br/>
I am actually kind of sad that I won't be running into all of you on <br/>
the trail every day.  Group boxing is a lot of fun and really helpful <br/>
too!  I don't think we would have found boxes 3 and 4 if we hadn't <br/>
had help.  We didn't find number 1...Firefly did so we were thrilled <br/>
to find her on that rock when we headed back down the trail.  Coleen <br/>
rules!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to NewBe for setting this up and it was really cool to meet <br/>
you all.  We will definitely be heading back to Richmond to hit the <br/>
rest of the boxes in the area.  The campground was great and so was <br/>
the rum.  Celtic Pride, you really missed the boat on that one!  Next <br/>
time we have a meet and greet, you all need to stay in the park so we <br/>
can party after we walk our butts off!<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, we did get one group of visitors.  Poor Psychomommy and <br/>
Turtle stumbled into our campsite after traipsing all over the park <br/>
for hours.  I think because so many different people placed boxes at <br/>
different times that the amount of walking required was enormous.  We <br/>
lucked out and came in backwards on a couple and saved ourselves <br/>
quite a lot of time and pain.  That said, Sarah and I were out cold <br/>
by the time we headed back yesterday night.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven't even been home yet! I am heading out now to do some laundry <br/>
and admire all of my new stamps.  Sarah is going to the Renn Fest <br/>
this weekend so I am on my own. I plan to place a couple of boxes <br/>
without her so expect some new postings soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for a lovely weekend and a truckload of laughs!<br/>
<br/>

TOO TIRED TO HAVE ANY STATS YET, TUNE IN NEXT WEEK, SAME BAT TIME,<br/>
SAME BAT CHANNEL! <br/>

Are you ready to try camping again? I know of a couple of beautiful <br/>
