What do you think about a Nurses PLB Ring?  Maybe have each person <br/>
carve a stamp that reflects the specialty that they work in?  What do <br/>
you think?  Let me know.<br/>

I am very aware of the PLB discussion site.  I was trying to include <br/>
everyone because there are alot of people who are not part of the <br/>
PLB discussion site and I wanted everyone to have a chance to <br/>
participate.  Does the one message that I posted bother you that <br/>
much?  I am not an idiot and do not need to be told to move my <br/>
discussion especially when I am trying to include everyone.  So you <br/>
see my purpose in posting where I posted was not to cause problems <br/>
but to reach people who are not a part of the PLB discussion site.  <br/>
And no I will not move my discussion!!!!!!!!<br/>

completely in line with the goals of the list. I would <br/>
also ask that you limit you PLB posting on this list. <br/>
Occasional posts about a new PLB ring being set up (on the <br/>
PLB talk list) seems the best way to provide the <br/>
educational opportunity for new boxers to learn about PLBs <br/>
and the PLB group.<br/>
