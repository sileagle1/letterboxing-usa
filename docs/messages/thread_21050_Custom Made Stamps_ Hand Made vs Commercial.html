I really enjoy a custom made stamp. It doesn't have to be hand <br/>
carved, but if it reflects the place where it is hidden then I am <br/>
happy. It can be much more expensive and more time consuming than <br/>
carving your own stamp. And as for store-bought stamps, Please, place <br/>
a lighthouse stamp at a lighthouse, place a stamp of a dragonfly on <br/>
the Dragonfly Trail, make the stamp mean something. What I hate is <br/>
the same old stamp that I have seen in the half off bin at Michaels <br/>
in a letterbox or as a hitchhiker AGAIN. It is not unique and I <br/>
already have 2 or 3 impressions of it in my logbook already. Granted, <br/>
one was found in North Carolina and one was a hitchhiker found in <br/>
California and one was at a gathering in Connecticut, but it is hard <br/>
to get excited about the same stamp again and again. That is really <br/>
great about the hand-carved, they are unique! They are ONE OF A <br/>
KIND! :-)I might have two dozen turtles in my logbook, but the hand-<br/>
carved ones are all different! <br/>

But I can see how that would get :::::really boring:::::. One thing about living here in Gotham is that at several different stores, one in particular, there are some totally AWESOME, commercially made stamps. Did I already say this? Hummmm........anyway.......I have seen some stamps that are just BEAUTIFUL, out of this world gorgeous and different. And of course, kids' stamps are in a catagory to themselves. Any little kid's stamp is great as far I'm concerned. Heck, they're kids. <br/>

I really don't mind a store bought stamp because I realize that not <br/>
everyone is able to carve.  This goes beyond thinking the act of <br/>
carving is too difficult, some people have real physical limitations. <br/>
For example neurological damage or disease that is not obvious on the <br/>
outside but affects vision and/or eye-hand coordination in small <br/>
ways.  Maybe they have vision loss and can no longer see fine detail <br/>
- even with good light and magnification.  This is something, I <br/>
think, that most healthy people aren't aware of unless they know <br/>
someone, work with it, or have it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that appreciate a finely carved stamp, but I'm also happy <br/>
with first try's and store bought stamps too.  What is important is <br/>
being able to participate.<br/>
<br/>

Here!  Here!  I depended solely on commercial stamps for the first <br/>
few years that I letterboxed.<br/>
<br/>
With encouragement and a few tips from catbead, I tried to carve.  My <br/>
first attempts weren't so great, but my children have fun playing <br/>
with them and creating letterbox hunts in the house on rainy/snowy <br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
I do now actively carve, albeit poorly, but I do the best I can.  I <br/>
have a hand carved stamp registered in Dartmoor, a few box stamps, <br/>
and I carved a personal traveler for myself and a sig stamp for <br/>
someone who was looking for something very rustic.<br/>
<br/>
When the commercial stamps in my boxes break or the box goes missing, <br/>
I replace them with hand carved stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Again, they are not great, but, heck, I carved them!<br/>

p.s.  As far as exchanges and finding boxes are concerned, I could <br/>
care less whether the stamp is commercial, hand carved, or is a <br/>
sticker - my joy is simply finding it.<br/>

What's really neat is when you can buy the custom stamp in the gift<br/>
shop of the place you're hiding the letterbox at! <br/>

It's just a pad to the left<br/>
And a book to the ri-i-i-i-ight<br/>
You put your stamp in the ink<br/>
And make your print just ri-i-i-i-i-ight<br/>

As far as stamps go, I have to admit that, in most cases, I enjoy <br/>
finding hand-carved stamps the most, but the occasional commercial <br/>
stamp is just fine. I've had several new LBers contact me and I've <br/>
encouraged each one to give carving a try - I just think that it adds <br/>
something to the fun of the game when you do your own carvings and put <br/>
them out there. If people give it a try and enjoy it, great! If not, or <br/>
if they cannot carve for some reason, well, I'm more than happy to have <br/>
people contributing to and taking enjoyment from the LB community.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I have met kids on the trail who used store-bought stamps. I <br/>
met one woman on the trail who had a problem with hand tremors - she <br/>
also used a commercial stamp. There are also some new folks who, for <br/>
whatever reason, are not comfortable carving just yet. While, for me <br/>
personally, the carving adds to the fun, I'd a thousand times rather <br/>
have a responsible LBer with a commercial stamp than an LBer who carves <br/>
a great stamp and then leaves boxes out in the open.<br/>
