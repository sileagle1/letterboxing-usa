direction next week.  We have decided to get together on Saturday.  I am so<br/>
excited to finally have a real exchange! (I'm the only letterboxer in<br/>
Eastern Idaho).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, the thought occurred to me that there is always some small<br/>
possibility that some others may be interested in gathering with us.  I know<br/>
there are a couple of letterboxers connected to Norther UT and CO, for<br/>
instance.  So I'm posting this note to ask if anyone else wishes to come.<br/>
We will probably get together near Idaho Falls on Saturday (which I believe<br/>
is the 19th).  Feel free to contact me if you wish to come.  I would love to<br/>
see anyone from UT, MT, WY, ID, CO, etc.-or for that matter, from anywhere!<br/>
We've talked about a possible cookout or eating out and hunting some local<br/>
boxes.  I'm going to go tonight and plant a new series just to have it ready<br/>
for Don, Gwen, and A-Bear's arrival.  I think I can get Rock Climber to come<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to see anyone that can make it.  I can get camping/lodging info for<br/>
any that need it.<br/>
