Your payment has been received.  The bulk order has been placed.  I <br/>
will send them out as soon as they arrive.  I am estimating anywhere <br/>
from late January to mid February.  Feel free to email me with any <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>

Oh good.   I was just getting a bit worried.   I tried to go to the Hermann <br/>
Werks website, and it doesn't seem to be there anymore.<br/>
<br/>
But everything's okay?<br/>

since I sent the order, but I was not expecting to hear from them <br/>

something.  <br/>
