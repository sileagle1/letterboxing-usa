Dennis, is the Rite in Rain product a particular type of paper that can
<br/>be produced in a different dimension?  Do they offer a similar
product
<br/>that would fit in the 3 5/8" X  3 5/8" jar that I just ordered? 
If they are
<br/>3 X 5" I suppose I could lop off 1 1/2" with a paper cutter...
</p><p>I've also wondered if its OK to just put a stamp in there and no log
book.
<br/>Is this a problem?  I may care less about who's been there (and
collecting
<br/>stamps for awards) than I do about just providing a "find" for someone.
<br/>You know what I mean?  Has anyone else thought about it this way?

<pre>Daniel has found the perfect box.  I would like to let you in on what I think the nearly perfect book.  Rite in the Rain, a J.L. Darling Company, product line produces all kinds of weather proof paper products.  I have used their field books and put a small 3X5 book in my tupperware boxes.  One of the problems I've had with the boxes is that they tend to get some condensation in them when the temp changes from warm fall to cool winter.  The letterbox flyers get soggy, but the rite-in-the-rain books stay "crisp" and usuable.  They take in stamp ink fine, too.

I think half the fun is "stamping in" with your own stamp and a few<br/>
written comments, thus having a  log book in the letterbox seems like a<br/>
necessity, IMHO<br/>
