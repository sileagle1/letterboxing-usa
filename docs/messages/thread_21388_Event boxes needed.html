Event boxes are requested for the Great Lakes Gathering on June 18th.<br/>
 The official website for the gathering is at<br/>
<br/>
http://home.wi.rr.com/dragonlber/GLG%202005.htm<br/>
<br/>
There is an address to send the boxes to on the webpage.<br/>
<br/>
I would particularly like to see the traveling event box named "The<br/>
Gathering" make it to this gathering as it is my traveling box and I'd<br/>
like to see how it's doing!  If you have it, please let me know where<br/>
it is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
