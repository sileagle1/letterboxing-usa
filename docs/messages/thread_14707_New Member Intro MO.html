I'm Malinda (waves). I found about letterboxing from the Carving Consortium <br/>
Forum.  I guess I did it backwards, sort of.  I do mail art, artistamps, <br/>
artist trading cards and have started carving stamps recently, I've done 4 <br/>
so far.  My DH, Ron (Structural Designer), and our two kids, Rianna (3 1/2) <br/>
and Geordan (10 mos) and myself (SAHM/Photographer) all love to be outdoors <br/>
and have traveled around the midwest looking for cool parks and places to <br/>
visit and be out in nature.  This seems like a perfect fit.  I took the <br/>
kids out Tuesday and we found our first letterbox, Snoopy in Shawnee <br/>
Mission, KS, and a new playground to visit.  We will be carving our family <br/>
stamp soon, I got everyone's approval for the design, and finding our log <br/>
book.  I have lots of ideas for new letterboxes in the Kansas City Metro <br/>
area and hope to spend fun weekends searching new ones out!  I'm glad there <br/>
are some letterboxers in the area and look forward to meeting them.<br/>

Hi, Malinda!!<br/>
<br/>
You found letterboxing in the same sort of backwards way I did!  :)  I'm a<br/>
Carving Consortium member, too, and have discovered a whole new way to use<br/>
my handcarved stamps.  I have two boxes ready to plant in the mid-Missouri<br/>
area - now I'm just waiting for a chance to go out and park them in the<br/>
woods.  I'm delighted to see more letterboxing action in Missouri!!<br/>

although did it the opposite way as you -- found out about CC after I <br/>
had begun carving stamps for letterboxes.<br/>

I am in Michigan and having fun populating the state with boxes and <br/>
hand-carved stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting!<br/>
