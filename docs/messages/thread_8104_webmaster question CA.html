Creek San Jose CA. I wrote this clue in rhyming couplets (I ain't no Shakespeare but they do rhyme.) <br/>
Unfortunately, by the time they hit the LbNA website the formatting had disappeared and it appears as <br/>
one long run on paragraph.  This has happened to me before. Is there any way, short of creating my own <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good question! I use several different computers (work, home, <br/>
library, neighbor's) using different systems (aol, Mac, IE) and <br/>
things look differently on each. I suspect the only way to get <br/>
formatting "exactly" right is to do your own pages.<br/>
<br/>
I put "exactly" in quotation marks because even really strict <br/>
handcoding can still be interpreted differently by each system....<br/>
<br/>
I'm always glad to do any tweaking of your clues that would make them <br/>
look better: I'll look back over those clues and sound out the <br/>
couplets with my next California update.<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the wonderful work!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Funhog looks like a great RAOLK candidate if anyone is looking <br/>
to volunteer....<br/>
