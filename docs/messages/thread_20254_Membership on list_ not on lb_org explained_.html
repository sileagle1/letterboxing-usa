&gt; In order to post a comment here, you have to be a member.  Out of <br/>
&gt; curiousity, for those opposed to a similar system for the LbNA <br/>
&gt; website, do you also object to the requirement to sign in to be <br/>
able <br/>
&gt; to post on the group boards?  If not, what's different about the <br/>
&gt; database v. this forum that you'd have different opinions?<br/>
have been removed]<br/>
<br/>
The general idea behind membership here on Yahoo Groups!  is  to <br/>
alleviate spam. Without first post moderation and requiring an email <br/>
address to sign up for membership, you would see a lot of porn, spam, <br/>
and other assorted junk filling up the precious space here in the <br/>
group. <br/>
<br/>
Flip side of the coin; from what I can gather the idea behind this <br/>
chatter about needing to be a member to access letterboxing.org is to <br/>
restrict who has access to clues. VERY VERY big difference here. Our <br/>
understanding of letterboxing is that its fun for everyone and <br/>
everyone can participate. There ought to not be any restrictions on <br/>
who who accesses clue.  Bottom line, if someone is intentionally <br/>
sabotaging you boxes....or if you don't want someone finding your <br/>
boxes than you can either make then incredibly difficult or circulate <br/>
your clues off-line to who you DO want to find your boxes. <br/>
<br/>
I can see the point in questioning why there's a membership <br/>
associated here while not with the lb.org site. Also remember that <br/>
Randy Hall owns this list and does not own <br/>
letterboxing.org....they're 2 entirely seperate entities. <br/>
