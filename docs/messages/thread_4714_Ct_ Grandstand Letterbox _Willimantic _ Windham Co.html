                    <div class="plaintext-content">   The Industrial Revolution was a time when the business of making <br/>
things boomed. Along with it the towns that were home to mills grew <br/>
and grew as workers poured in from the country and distant countries <br/>
to work in the mills. Willimantic is one of those towns and now just <br/>
a  ghost of its former life remains. The huge stone mills remain now <br/>
being made home to several small companies instead of the American <br/>
Thread.  At the peak of its power , the mill ran seven buildings , <br/>
owned a store for workers to shop in , owned a small shuttle railroad <br/>
to move product about and even the houses the mill workers lived in. <br/>
The mill even provided an annual fair for the entertainment of the <br/>
families of its town. The Mill owned fairgrounds were just down river <br/>
from the great mill. There was a very large grandstand to seat the <br/>
crowds that poured into town for the fair and all the families of the <br/>
mill workers  came out to see great horse racing. Below the <br/>
grandstand a dusty oval track  lay and harness racing horses careened <br/>
around it in moments of glory barely remembered. <br/>
    Those fairgrounds are now known as Willimantic's Rec park! Home <br/>
to many an evening baseball game, the river still flows and the great <br/>
stone pillars stand gaurd at the entrance. Unfortunatley there is no <br/>
place in the park to hide a letterbox to commemorate its heyday. So <br/>
to find the box you should visit the Windham Textile and History <br/>
Muesam at 157 Union and Main St. Right across from the Stone Mills <br/>
below the frog bridge. The muesam is open FRI - SAT - SUN  1-4 and <br/>
other times by chance. You enter the small gift shop from Main St. <br/>
there is parking right there next to the building. When you walk in <br/>
you will see that frogs are the theme and the friendly hosts will let <br/>
you seek your box.  The Grandstand Letterbox lies far below SINGER in <br/>
a small space of wood that could be moved and carried. <br/>
<br/>
This box is part of the 2002 Sweeney School Series and planted by <br/>
Leader of the Pack for all to enjoy 3/17/02  Rated :easy -drive <br/>
up.It's the history lesson that counts!<br/>
