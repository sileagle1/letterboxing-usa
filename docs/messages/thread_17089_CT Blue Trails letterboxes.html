Reply about CT Blue Trails.  Yes, Keven, there are many boxes on the<br/>
blue trails in CT. Some hikes are longer than others, but some also<br/>
are close to trail heads.  Get a blue book and cross reference in the<br/>
towns you want to lettebox.You can also ask off line to many 'busy'<br/>
boxers as many of us know the Blue Trails well. I will be happy to help<br/>

PawPrint, Singin In the rain, Bedd Rugg, Fifty Foot , Vermont State <br/>
Quarter, Rock Climber, Grist in the Mist  well I bet there are more <br/>
that are not popping in to my head but you get the picture  Leader of <br/>
