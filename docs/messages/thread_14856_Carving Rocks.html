&gt; Hey Sir B.<br/>
&gt; Are you going to give instructions on how to carve out a real rock? <br/>
&gt; Do we need to bring a jack hammer along? LOL<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
In case this was a real question:<br/>
<br/>
If you are carving rock, I would suggest Feather Rock, which is a <br/>
volcanic "glassy" and porous material available in garden supply <br/>
stores. You might have seen small fountains made of it. Pumice may <br/>
work as well, but I have never used it.<br/>
<br/>
I used a cordless drill with a concrete bit in it to do most of my <br/>
carving.<br/>
<br/>
Take a look at the article linked here http://www.cichlid-<br/>
forum.com/articles/diy_featherrock.php<br/>
<br/>
Gives a pretty good idea of the safety precautions you should take, <br/>
as well: gloves, glasses, and I use a dust mask. Be safe doing this.<br/>
<br/>
You may make your own "rocks" using oven-clay or a mixture of <br/>
vermiculite and plaster. In any case, you want a cavity that will <br/>
hold your letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
It is an elegant solution to some very hard problems of how to hide <br/>
something in plain sight. Old, dirty rocks are almost never hefted.  <br/>
And if folks expect to see a rock, they generally do see a rock.<br/>
<br/>
I may give a demo on rock carving and making at our October 4th San <br/>
Luis Obispo CA get-together.<br/>
<br/>
Guess my question was wasted on this crowd; hope my answer is not,<br/>

Another suggested rock is sold around here as travertine. I buy mine <br/>
at the Oceano Nursery<br/>
1311 Paso Robles St.<br/>
Oceano, CA 93445<br/>
Phone 805.489.4456<br/>
<br/>
I got two rocks for $5.25 (0.35 per pound)<br/>

Sorry if my first post on this thread sounded grumpy. I had issues <br/>
but not with the author of the post who asked about jack hammers.<br/>

I would guess, because we do not get rain here from March till late <br/>
October, that the boxes will dissolve eventually. I have sprayed them <br/>
with something akin to matte finish Krylon, top and bottom. I put <br/>
either film cannisters or Tupper-type-ware inside them. <br/>
<br/>
If they are sitting in water, I would advise either using oven-<br/>
hardening clay or go ahead and carve out some travertine or feather <br/>
stone.<br/>
<br/>
Another downside of the plaster rocks is they are very lightweight. <br/>
If you have a windy and exposed spot, I would not use them there. One <br/>
of mine hides under a bush, one is jammed right between a tombstone <br/>
and a wall.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. Let me know what you find out.<br/>
