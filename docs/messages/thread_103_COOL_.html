PS.  Rachel, I'm bummed that when I was in Chicago for a long weekend I<br/>
wasn't able to get up to Evanston to find your box. Maybe next time!<br/>

Do you live near Wendell?<br/>
<br/>
I liked your clues a lot. The rock juttin out of the trail was great <br/>
- it had a crack in it like a mouth, and really did look like a <br/>
dolphin or a giant frog. I'm pretty positive the one I saw was the <br/>
one you meant. There were three large birches after it, within 30 <br/>
feet. But I couldn't identify for sure the leaning tree or the <br/>
clearing it pointed to. I searched for 1 1/2 hours  in that area for <br/>
a small shelter, but with no luck.<br/>
<br/>
I will go back in the spring and try again. Thanks for a great <br/>
outing!<br/>
