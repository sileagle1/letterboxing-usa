Placed at Schooley Mill Park<br/>
State: Maryland<br/>
County:  Howard<br/>
Closest "city":  Highland, MD<br/>
Clues:  easy<br/>
Hike:  easy.  Approximately 1-2 miles on flat terrain.<br/>
<br/>
Please note:  This park is apparantly a huge favorite for horses.  I highly recommend that you watch your step along the trails!  Also, when I was there, the trail was quite muddy in places.  Wear shoes that you don't mind getting a little muddy!   This is a really pretty park.  I'd never been there before today!  Even the drive to the park is really pretty - lots of farmland.<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.co.ho.md.us/RAP/RAP_HoCoParksSchooleyMill.htm">Howard County Parks: Schooley Mill Park</a> <u><br/>
</u><br/>
Schooley Mill Park is located on Hall Shop Road between Rte 108 and Rte 216 in Highland, MD.<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park and drive past the horse rings and jumps.  Continue up the hill and park near the playground.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Start your journey at the western corner of the parking lot.  Follow the paved sidewalk past the soccer field on your left.  You will soon arrive at a trail map.  Take a peek if you wish!<br/>
<br/>
Enter the forest at Post 2.  At the campfire turn left to Post 3.  Continue following trail past a park bench.  At the first fork, bear left.  At the second fork bear right past Post 6.  Pass Post 7.  You will come to a fork at Posts 8 and 9.  Stay to the right.<br/>
<br/>
Soon you will come to a beaver pond.  I didn't see any beavers while I was there, but it is definitely worth taking a moment to check out the beavers handiwork.  Walk to the next bench.  From the bench, take 20 steps.  See a faint path leading to the beaver pond and to a bird house sporting half a flying saucer.  Just as you begin to head down this little trail, you will see three friends on your left.  One of the friends is trying to jump into the beaver pond.  Look where the three friends meet.  HOOT!<br/>
<br/>
<b>Hum Letterbox</b>  <br/>
<br/>
Keep a-walking!  Past post 11.  Shhhhh!  Can you hear the stream gurgling on your right?  See another bench.  Have a rest if you wish.  At 12 go straight.  At 16 start counting.  78 steps will take you to a large, flat, grey rock on your right.  Shhhh!  Something is humming under that rock.  Beware the pricker vines that may be lurking nearby.  Make sure you take a peek before sticking your hand into any dark damp places!<br/>
<br/>
After stamping and rehiding carefully, follow the trail to the meadow.  Turn left.  At next intersection, turn right towards the fences.  The trail will take you to the playground and your car.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!
