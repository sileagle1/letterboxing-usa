When I logged in I noticed all these little green flags, which means I've found those boxes.  The problem is........I didn't find any of them!  I think someone else's finds were logged in for me.  It's someone who has found a LOT of boxes.  I was going to change the status, before I realized how many there were, but every time I do that and go back to the previous page it won't let me get to that page.  It takes me back to the Find Boxes Page.  This was sometimes a problem beofre too, but I could hit refresh and I was all set.  This time refresh doesn't work.<br/>

Okay, I give up.  What green flags? I've been looking all over for all<br/>
the new changes and I see no green flags anywhere.  I have gone to<br/>
Member Services to try to load in my finds, but am unable to find the<br/>
function to let me type anything in..  This hare must be technolically<br/>

The green flags on the box name lists are only there if the clue is <br/>
NOT hosted on LbNA. Otherwise, the green flag appears on the clue page <br/>
itself.<br/>
<br/>
Look up the boxes you've found. If you don't see a green flag by the <br/>
name in the list, the clue is hosted on LbNA. Click on the link to the <br/>
clue and there will be a green flag on the clue page itself. Click the <br/>
green flag and list your find date. If there is a green flag beside <br/>
the name in the list, the clue is hosted elsewhere other than LbNA. If <br/>
you click on the green flag on the list page it will bring up a page <br/>
to log the date of your find.<br/>
<br/>
That way you can log your finds for any box as long as its name is <br/>
listed on LbNA.<br/>

Usually, we don't comment on posts to this list, but we have to agree with Enders Angel's comment below.  Folks can do what they want, of course, and we're not putting down anyone who likes other sites or more information on letterboxing sites generally.  We happen to like less.  Less technology and fewer bells and whistles, both in terms of the look and feel, and the substance.  'Boxers can and do communicate amongst themselves as to box status and other information needs, and we don't perceive the need to change any aspect of the site as far as we're concerned.  But it's the "cultural" issue behind EA's post that really moved us to de-lurk and share our view.  We think letterboxing is fun because people work hard to carve good stamps, find good hiding places and good hikes, write good clues, and give a good effort to find boxes. Not finding a box on the first, second or third try is, in our view, part of what it's all about, as is mystery, the occasional surprise, and all the trappings of a pseudo-underground group. This isn't supposed to be a rant, just a voice -- things can get over-organized and over-engineered, and we wouldn't want that to happen.  We do appreciate the hard work and responsiveness to popular feeling exhibited by the folks who help us all enjoy this phenomenon on the internet, and maybe we're just contrarian, but we felt we should speak.  Different people see letterboxing in different ways.  We like seeing it through a glass, darkly.  <br/>

At any rate, when we first started letterboxing, we found several right off the bat.  But just the other day, we went searching in our area with a list that had several along our route, it was very disappointing to have about six out of ten of them not be found....only because they weren't there or had long been abandoned.  Also, we noted that several of the ones we did find were running very low on stamping pages and it looked like by the dates listed that they had not been checked up on in a long while.  My suggestion would be if there is no sort of tracking available on the websites, and placers can't seem to be contacted by email before hand for some reason, then I would hope that the placers would be checking up on their placed boxes now and then and see how they are doing....or even email someone in the areas they have placed them in and ask them to check and see what the status of them are.  I know that most people already do that, but it seems that some clues have posted to the site years ago and people aren't checking up on the boxes.  At least that is what we have been discovering.   My doubloon's worth once again.  *Smiles*<br/>

HI,<br/>
<br/>
I personally like to able to keep up with my box finds online.  I <br/>
have 2 small children and I don't have just an abundance of time to <br/>
devote to doing some of the extra work that Enders Angel suggested.  <br/>
I also do not believe that it is a contest to see who can find the <br/>
most boxes, but it is so interesting to see how many boxes some have <br/>
found.   I am actually envious of the ones that have had the time <br/>
and energy to find so many boxes.  What travels that must have had <br/>
finding all of these boxes.  The website does help you keep up with <br/>
things that otherwise I would not have the time to do.  It is also <br/>
nice to not have to go get your logbook everytime you want to check <br/>
out something about a letterbox that you have found.  This is not <br/>
being lazy but being time challenged.  I just wanted to voice my <br/>
opinion and say that I love letterboxing and the actual finds also <br/>
let you know who is a veteran and who you could possibly look to for <br/>
answers to letterboxing questions.  <br/>
<br/>

&gt; The reason I would like to see alert flags for missing or damaged <br/>
boxes be listed is this.....sometimes I take all four kids with me <br/>
when letterboxing.....*laughs* though after all the bickering we put <br/>
up with lately, I am beginning to rethink that and might just go with <br/>
my wife only!  At any rate, when we first started letterboxing, we <br/>
found several right off the bat.  But just the other day, we went <br/>
searching in our area with a list that had several along our route, <br/>
it was very disappointing to have about six out of ten of them not be <br/>
found....only because they weren't there or had long been abandoned.  <br/>
Also, we noted that several of the ones we did find were running very <br/>
low on stamping pages and it looked like by the dates listed that <br/>
they had not been checked up on in a long while.  My suggestion would <br/>
be if there is no sort of tracking available on the websites, and <br/>
placers can't seem to be contacted by email before hand for some <br/>
reason, then I would hope that the placers would be checking up on <br/>
their placed boxes now and then and see how they are doing....or even <br/>
email someone in the areas they have placed them in and ask them to <br/>
check and see what the status of them are.  I know that most people <br/>
already do that, but it seems that some clues have posted to the site <br/>
years ago and people aren't checking up on the boxes.  At least that <br/>
is what we have been discovering.   My doubloon's worth once again.  <br/>

&gt;   Usually, we don't comment on posts to this list, but we have to <br/>
agree with Enders Angel's comment below.  Folks can do what they <br/>
want, of course, and we're not putting down anyone who likes other <br/>
sites or more information on letterboxing sites generally.  We happen <br/>
to like less.  Less technology and fewer bells and whistles, both in <br/>
terms of the look and feel, and the substance.  'Boxers can and do <br/>
communicate amongst themselves as to box status and other information <br/>
needs, and we don't perceive the need to change any aspect of the <br/>
site as far as we're concerned.  But it's the "cultural" issue behind <br/>
EA's post that really moved us to de-lurk and share our view.  We <br/>
think letterboxing is fun because people work hard to carve good <br/>
stamps, find good hiding places and good hikes, write good clues, and <br/>
give a good effort to find boxes. Not finding a box on the first, <br/>
second or third try is, in our view, part of what it's all about, as <br/>
is mystery, the occasional surprise, and all the trappings of a <br/>
pseudo-underground group. This isn't supposed to be a rant, just a <br/>
voice -- things can get over-organized and over-engineered, and we <br/>
wouldn't want that to happen.  We do appreciate the hard work and <br/>
responsiveness to popular feeling exhibited by the folks who help us <br/>
all enjoy this phenomenon on the internet, and maybe we're just <br/>
contrarian, but we felt we should speak.  Different people see <br/>
letterboxing in different ways.  We like seeing it through a glass, <br/>
darkly.  <br/>

Actually, we like being able to keep track of our boxes on AQ, too, <br/>
but not just because of the box count. It's also fun to see who's <br/>
found your box (since the "Found" option sends us e-mail to let us <br/>
know, even if the finder doesn't leave a message). Makes it a little <br/>
easier to find and connect with local boxers because you then have <br/>
the option of contacting THEM as well as vice versa. It may be <br/>
different in areas where you have TONS of boxers and lots of <br/>
gatherings close by, but for those of us who're spread out few and <br/>
far between, it's nice to make connections you normally can't.<br/>
<br/>
Just our two cents!<br/>

&gt; HI,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I personally like to able to keep up with my box finds online.  I <br/>
&gt; have 2 small children and I don't have just an abundance of time to <br/>
&gt; devote to doing some of the extra work that Enders Angel <br/>
suggested.  <br/>
&gt; I also do not believe that it is a contest to see who can find the <br/>
&gt; most boxes, but it is so interesting to see how many boxes some <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; found.   I am actually envious of the ones that have had the time <br/>
&gt; and energy to find so many boxes.  What travels that must have had <br/>
&gt; finding all of these boxes.  The website does help you keep up with <br/>
&gt; things that otherwise I would not have the time to do.  It is also <br/>
&gt; nice to not have to go get your logbook everytime you want to check <br/>
&gt; out something about a letterbox that you have found.  This is not <br/>
&gt; being lazy but being time challenged.  I just wanted to voice my <br/>
&gt; opinion and say that I love letterboxing and the actual finds also <br/>
&gt; let you know who is a veteran and who you could possibly look to <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; answers to letterboxing questions.  <br/>
