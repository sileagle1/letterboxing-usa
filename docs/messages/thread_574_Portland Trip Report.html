<br/>
I am home safe and sound from my trip to Portland, and just to set the<br/>
record straight, I had nothing to do with the very hot humid whether.<br/>
<br/>
I ventured off last Saturday morning to find Rock Creek #1, #2, and #3.  To<br/>
make a long story short, I never found #1, found #2 (Yea!! my first find. I<br/>
wondered back to the picnic table, started pulling everything out of my<br/>
stamping kit and found that I forgot to bring any stamps, duh.  So I carved<br/>
a signature stamp there on the spot.), found the spot for #3 but decided<br/>
against the physical activity required to recover the box.  THIS IS SO MUCH<br/>
FUN!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Other than finding the box I saw a snake in the very tall grass.  My first<br/>
thought was, "what do I know about snakes in Oregon....(dread), nothing".  I<br/>
waded through the grass in hopes that a particular spot would yield a box,<br/>
but when I could see that the blackberry brambles surrounded, I said to my<br/>
self hopefully, "they wouldn't do that to me...would they?" and gave up.<br/>
