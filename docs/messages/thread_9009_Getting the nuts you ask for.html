&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; Last year I felt all alone in Maryland hiding boxes and begging for <br/>
more to find. Along came an article in the Post and with it a flood <br/>
of nuts. As most of you know I usually sign off with "May there be <br/>
lots of nuts in your life." Well I think that has come true for all <br/>
of us in the Mid-Atlantic Area. Enter Squirrels Girls ( the <br/>
collective name) consisting of Psychomommy, Turtle, Apple Dumpling <br/>
Gang, Fireflylight and Mudmommy. Now if that isn't a bunch of nuts I <br/>
don't know what is. They have come into our lives with sillyness and <br/>
lots of boxes to find and for that I am truly grateful. I got what I <br/>
wished for and I hope the rest of you are enjoying this silly hobby.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; May you be a nut in someone's life,<br/>

&gt; M25 missing and gaining (I think I hold the record on missing or <br/>
wet boxes)<br/>
