Please help me out... I need your opinions.  As most of you know by now, I am<br/>
working on updating our State Contacts system.  Part of my plan is to provide<br/>
a contact for each state.  Today I was updating the links for the maps, and I<br/>
noticed that the programming code that corresponds to the maps we've been<br/>
using doesn't include Rhode Island, or Deleware.<br/>
<br/>
This is not a major problem... I can edit the code myself.  It occurs to me,<br/>
however, that these states are so tiny on the maps we're using that they are<br/>
hard to see, and even harder to click on.<br/>
<br/>
I have a proposal for giving a facelift to the maps we're using.  I don't want<br/>
to just go changing things, though, unless I am convinced that you, the<br/>
members of our group, approve of the changes.  So PLEASE voice your opinions<br/>
about my ideas...<br/>
<br/>
The new map that I am proposing we switch to can be found at:<br/>
www.pclink.com/elf/lboxusa2.htm<br/>
<br/>
This map is larger, includes labels for the states (more user-friendly for<br/>
kids?), and makes it much easier to click on the smaller states.  (Clicking on<br/>
the labels works as well as clicking on the state outlines.)<br/>
<br/>
To keep from overcrowding the main page, I am proposing we move the State<br/>
Contacts map to the Group Mail page, as it appears at:<br/>
www.pclink.com/elf/mail2.htm<br/>
<br/>
This State Contacts map is quite colorful and (I think) very pleasing to the<br/>
eye.  It could be altered to all be one color, though, if you think it would<br/>
be better.<br/>
<br/>
Please speak up!!  Would these maps be an improvement?  Would it be better<br/>
just to leave things the way they are?  What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your consideration,<br/>

I like moving this map to a different page, but again like the old one<br/>
better.  I would not color in the states arbitrarily in any case because<br/>
it is confusing.  The one map uses colored states to indicate something,<br/>
and this coloring is arbitrary, that is the confusion, IMO.<br/>

I like the new map a lot.  Especially for kids, too.  Tally a Yes for me.<br/>
<br/>
Being a newbie though, I would encourage you to consider keeping the contact map on the "home page".  I found it most encouraging to find contact info right there at the front of the site.  It's really not that big a deal though.<br/>

Casting my vote: I like the current grey/dark grey map better than the new<br/>
map.  If the problem with the current map is just DE and RI, can you put a<br/>
little pointer (like DE and RI have on the proposed map) to the state and<br/>
make the pointer the link location?<br/>
<br/>
If the overall vote goes towards the proposed map, one suggestion I'd make<br/>
about the format is to consider only putting the state initials (like "PA")<br/>
on the states that have letterboxes.  It would make the distinction even<br/>
clearer.<br/>
<br/>
To me, it's much less important what the map looks like than just the fact<br/>
that it's there!  Thanks for your efforts, Dan!<br/>

&gt; Hi Mitch.  I went to the site in your E-mail but the maps didn't appear.  <br/>
&gt;  Just two lovely empty boxes where they should be!  Hmm.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Anyway, I like the idea of people being able to click on the names of <br/>
&gt;  states, because not everybody in the US, much less from other countries, <br/>
&gt;  has a good grasp of US geography.  And yes, some of the eastern states <br/>
&gt;  are too small to click on.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  That's my vote.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Bonnie McLaughlin<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else having trouble viewing these new maps?  They look fine on my<br/>
browser...<br/>

Can't you create a map with callout arrows connecting the state to the<br/>
states' initials ? You could put the states' initial outside the<br/>
confines of the US and upon clicking on the initials, be taken to the<br/>
states' more detailed map.<br/>

<td><pre>Hi, Everyone!!
Please help me out... I need your opinions.  As most of you know by now, I am
working on updating our State Contacts system.  Part of my plan is to provide
a contact for each state.  Today I was updating the links for the maps, and I
noticed that the programming code that corresponds to the maps we've been
using doesn't include Rhode Island, or Deleware.

This is not a major problem... I can edit the code myself.  It occurs to me,
however, that these states are so tiny on the maps we're using that they are
hard to see, and even harder to click on.

I have a proposal for giving a facelift to the maps we're using.  I don't want
to just go changing things, though, unless I am convinced that you, the
members of our group, approve of the changes.  So PLEASE voice your opinions
about my ideas...

The new map that I am proposing we switch to can be found at:
www.pclink.com/elf/lboxusa2.htm

This map is larger, includes labels for the states (more user-friendly for
kids?), and makes it much easier to click on the smaller states.  (Clicking on
the labels works as well as clicking on the state outlines.)

To keep from overcrowding the main page, I am proposing we move the State
Contacts map to the Group Mail page, as it appears at:
www.pclink.com/elf/mail2.htm

This State Contacts map is quite colorful and (I think) very pleasing to the
eye.  It could be altered to all be one color, though, if you think it would
be better.

Please speak up!!  Would these maps be an improvement?  Would it be better
just to leave things the way they are?  What do you think?

Thank you for your consideration,
  -- Mitch</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

Thanks again for taking the initiative in this - this just becomes more<br/>
and more refined, getting better al the time.<br/>
<br/>
AS to the maps: to my eye, the multi-colored version (the state contacts<br/>
example), doesn't look as good. I find it very powerful to see how this<br/>
hobby is spreading as indicated by map color (i.e., gray for no<br/>
activity, color ((blue is OK))for activity). The multi-color example<br/>
detracts from this, the 2-color scheme emphasizes the growing unity<br/>
among us. <br/>
<br/>
I think it is good to have state abbreviations - the large maps<br/>
facilitate this and are good. Perhaps a bullet with RI or DE and an<br/>
arrow would solve that problem - gray now, blue when active?<br/>
<br/>
I can't decide which map to put up first - agruements for either one are<br/>
equally valid as far as I am concerned. Maybe the right choice is<br/>
neither one, but instead, the first page might have some other strong<br/>
graphic image (carved stamp, photo of a letterbox, something else), with<br/>
a small amount of intro text, and two small U.S maps, each titled (and<br/>
linked) to the two state maps. Its important to get to the maps very<br/>
early on, but one step in is not too bad.<br/>
<br/>
Yup, lets put Dartmoor down by Florida it might make it easier to get<br/>
Adrian or Graham to visit us (or, vice versa?). Seriously, maybe that<br/>
first page could also have a small UK map at some point, linking to<br/>
whatever seems right for Adrian and Graham. Just another thought.<br/>
