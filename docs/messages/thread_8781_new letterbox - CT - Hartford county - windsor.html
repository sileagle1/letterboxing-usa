<br/>
Difficulty - simple <br/>
Time - 25 minutes including stamping in<br/>
Directions to starting place - From Interstate 91 heading north, take <br/>
Exit 38. From Interstate 91 heading south, take Exit 38A. Turn right <br/>
at the exit on to Poquonock  Avenue (Route 75). Go about 1.5 miles<br/>
and turn left on to Prospect Hill Rd.   Turn right at the traffic <br/>
circle on to Lang Road and continue up the road to the Northwest <br/>
Parking area. Proceed from parking lot to the red barn Nature Center, <br/>
where trail maps are available.  These directions are shamelessly <br/>
stolen from the Slow Poke Letterbox people, Tom, Debbie and Rebecca.  <br/>
Thanks to them for bringing me to this wonderful park.<br/>
<br/>
Details you should know - This is a great place.  I hiked around to <br/>
find the very nice Slow Poke Letterbox and discovered the nature <br/>
center after planting my box.  Definitely worth stopping in to check <br/>
it out. There is also a tobacco museum there that I'm looking forward <br/>
to visiting when I plant my next box.<br/>
<br/>
Details you don't need to know -  Lots of pretty dried flowers and <br/>
pods this autumn day.  A funny thing happened.  I'm walking along and <br/>
hear some rustling way up in some high tree branches followed by  a <br/>
pretty good thump behind me.  A squirrel was trucking along in a tree <br/>
and fell out.  He gave me a dirty look and ran off, so I guess he's <br/>
not hurt.  Made me laugh.  Not important, but it's interesting to<br/>
know that there is a sugar house on the grounds, as well.  Here's an <br/>
informative website address. www.northwestpark.org. <br/>
<br/>
Clues:	First go do the bog trail and find Slow Poke.  On your way <br/>
back look for the yellow Wetland Forest Trail.  Start at the end of <br/>
the trail closest to the nature center.  Walk in a bit until you come <br/>
to the Dr. Gordon S. Taylor watery swamp or pond observation deck.  <br/>
This is not on the map.  Go to the end, look at nature, figure out <br/>
what those gates are for and email me to let me know.  Then head back <br/>
to the sign near the beginning of the bridge.  Dr. Taylor is guarding <br/>
the box.  	<br/>
<br/>
Please email any box needs to rtrw@attbi.com.  Thanks.<br/>
