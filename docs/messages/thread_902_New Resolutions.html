we placed for the gathering, to keep it unique for the people who <br/>
found it this weekend, but we've left the box (and added another <br/>
close by for good measure) and are including them both in a revised <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Resolution<br/>
<br/>
Placed January 1, 2000 (and revised twice<br/>
since then) at Rocky Neck State Park in<br/>
East Lyme, CT. There are three letterboxes<br/>
by the sea. This hike covers 3 easy miles,<br/>
including 1/4 mile of level beach combing. <br/>
<br/>
Directions: on I-95 take exit 72, the Rocky<br/>
Neck Connector. At the bottom of the<br/>
hill, the main entrance to the park is to<br/>
the left. We'll go right on Rte. 156 West<br/>
to park at a hiker's entrance that avoids the<br/>
seasonal fees and crowds. Heading uphill on this<br/>
road, park on your left at the top of the hill,<br/>
across from a campground, in an unmarked lot.<br/>
Your car will be quite safe here: this is where all<br/>
the local walkers park.<br/>
<br/>
Walk south through the gate and past a<br/>
map of the trails. Continue south on the<br/>
blue trail, and then turn left (east-<br/>
southeast) on the red-blazed Bride<br/>
Brook Trail. Pass a nicely balanced glacial erratic<br/>
to the left and travel pleasantly downhill for half<br/>
a mile. Bear right at a crossover fork and then<br/>
straight with the red where the white trail joins<br/>
in. The grade levels out: pass along a forested<br/>
tongue between salt estuaries before crossing a<br/>
bridge near osprey nests.<br/>
<br/>
Exiting into a picnic ground/parking lot,<br/>
head left (east) to find a large deck<br/>
overlooking the salt marsh. The Hermit<br/>
Crab Letterbox is tucked into the western<br/>
footing of the ramp leading up to the deck on the<br/>
left: hop over the fence and look underneath for<br/>
your reward.<br/>
<br/>
Now head back out into the parking area<br/>
and cut left (south-southeast) to cross the<br/>
road. Walk through two parking lots to<br/>
the East Beach bath house. Just behind it,<br/>
find a boardwalk through a tunnel out to the<br/>
shore. <br/>
Beachcomb west along either the shore or the<br/>
boardwalk to the magnificent "Pavilion." This<br/>
dance hall was built of stone in the Arts and<br/>
Crafts style by the CCC and WPA in 1936, and is<br/>
still quite popular with the summer people from Hartford. At the <br/>
south-southwest corner of the<br/>
porch, overlook a hidden picnic area with<br/>
splendid oaks and smooth gneiss. Down at the<br/>
brushy southern end overlooking Long Island<br/>
Sound, look in the base of a small double beech<br/>
clinging to the cliff in the west-southwest, for the<br/>
Gathering Letterbox (placed for the second<br/>
annual LBNA Letterbox Get Together).<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the porch, walk to the far<br/>
eastern end and turn left (north). Bridge<br/>
over the railroad tracks. Bear sharp left<br/>
with the paving after the bridge and<br/>
parallel the tracks behind the Pavilion. As the<br/>
paved road begins to bear right, cut left on a faint<br/>
path and follow the cliff line north with a new<br/>
estuary below to the west. The trails are briefly<br/>
unmarked here, but easy to follow: just stay near<br/>
the edge and head north. Almost reaching the<br/>
top, find an expansive view on a smooth rounded<br/>
granite cliff with faded yellow trail markers here<br/>
and there. From this spot, the far point of Giant's<br/>
Neck bears 020 degrees and a boat ramp, half<br/>
obscured by foliage in season, is just below at<br/>
296. Continue northwards along the cliffs and up<br/>
a short steep path to the highest point and more<br/>
smooth granite. There is less of a view here, with<br/>
the low trees blocking the way. Facing west, the<br/>
boat ramp, now very hard to see through trees, is<br/>
just opposite at 285 degrees and another small<br/>
path is on your left at 146 degrees. Turn around<br/>
and bushwack 15 or 20 steps on a heading of 075<br/>
degrees to find another ledge's edge, overlooking<br/>
a trail junction to the east. Your third find, the<br/>
Resolution Letterbox, is on the ground under<br/>
rocks by an oak on the edge of the rocky drop off.<br/>
<br/>
To complete your hike, continue north along<br/>
the cliffs to intersect with the main blue<br/>
trail and bear left (north). Stay to the<br/>
left/north at the next intersection and<br/>
follow the trail, now blazed in red and blue.<br/>
When the red breaks right on 030 degrees, you<br/>
can follow it directly back to your car, but we<br/>
recommend staying left on the blue trail heading<br/>
320 degrees along the river. Pass a boat yard and<br/>
descend to walk north through a field. Nearing<br/>
the road (Rte. 156), watch for a right and cut east<br/>
through a stone wall. Make a rooty climb, staying<br/>
with the blue all the way to the top, and another<br/>
field. Crossing the field, turn left (north) and a<br/>
short way later find your car. Happy New Year!<br/>
