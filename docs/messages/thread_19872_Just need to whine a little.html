<br/>
It has been too long since the family and I have really gotten out <br/>
there and did some serious boxing.  We have hit a few drive by boxes <br/>
here and there, so I'm not going into major withdrawls... yet, but I <br/>
need to get out there. <br/>
<br/>
I've carved 3 stamps and a HH and have the boxes in the car ready to <br/>
go at a moments notice, but we just can't seem to get to the parks, <br/>
ect. to plant them.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have this happen where life just won't let you spend some <br/>
serious time letterboxing?  All I can say is thank goodness for the <br/>
talk lists or I'd really be going crazy. Maybe someone should create <br/>
a 12 step program for letterboxers. <br/>

I know the feeling. Eventhough I've only been letterboxing for less than a week,<br/>
I am going through withdraws. Since I'm currently job-hunting, I have free time<br/>
in which I could be hunting for boxes. But, my boyfriend has a job that keeps<br/>
him busy during all the daylight hours, and he would feel so left out if I went<br/>
looking for boxes w/o him, so here I am waiting til Sunday when he can go too.<br/>
But at least the lists and email from all the great letterboxers is giving me<br/>
lots to read :-) It's all I seem to be able to think about these days.<br/>

You sound like me! I was hoping the summer time would afford me the luxury of going out on l-o-n-g letterboxing excursions with the kids. Doesn't that sound delightful? <br/>
<br/>
But life does get in the way! Work I can understand! But how can my kids prefer to do things like skateboard...swim...ride bikes...or just plain hang out with friends....as opposed to letterboxing???  They must be insane!<br/>
<br/>
And then...my husband is not into the letterboxing thing...so when we go away he is in no way interested! It's very frustrating! I print clues out...pack my backpack....and look at maps...to no avail! :(<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad for the lists! And I've been keeping busy putting together boxes to plant and postal letterboxes! So...it's not too bad! <br/>

My kids are the same way!  They do have a great time once I get them out the door though!  I'm in CT so we have lots of boxes to choose from.  I try to let them help me pick, like the Good Grief series in Glastonbury that is Snoopy Characters, or boxes in parks where we make a deal they can play for awhile before moving on.  When all else fails I bribe them with McDonalds or ice cream!!!  :o)<br/>
