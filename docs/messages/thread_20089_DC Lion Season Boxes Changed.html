I carved four new ones and went out to replace them today and found <br/>
that only one was missing.<br/>
<br/>
(Now I have to track that e-mail from the guy who told me they were <br/>
all gone.)<br/>
<br/>
ANYHOOO, There are four NEW lions.  Two are in slightly different <br/>
places. (I caught some flack about the latrine-like area of the <br/>
previous 3rd box.) Sorry, my bad.<br/>
<br/>
If you liked the original, you'll LOVE these.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and box like nobody's lookin'.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are the clue site and at my Web site (under construction)<br/>
