Update / Slight Corrections to be noted for:<br/>
<br/>
GREEN LAKES STATE PARK:<br/>
<br/>
-#1:The Ace of Spades, Clubs and Hearts: Upon entering the park and<br/>
after passing the ticket booth, you cannot take the first road to the<br/>
right because it is closed. Park in the small lot across from it and<br/>
walk in.  It's an extra 1/4 mile (at the most).<br/>
<br/>
-#2: We replaced the "THE ACE OF HEARTS", it was MIA as reported. And<br/>
while there discovered that one of the clues had fallen down.  Where<br/>
the clues say in French Script:<br/>
"fungus-among-us / woodpecker holes = between"<br/>
the "woodpecker holes" are still there but a big part of it has fallen<br/>
on the the little path mentioned.  You will have to approach your<br/>
target area from below.  We also noticed a big dead branch hanging up<br/>
in one of the live trees so be aware of it.  It looked like it would<br/>
make a lot of noise on its way down.<br/>
<br/>
-#3:**MICRO-BOX NOTE / THE ACE OF CLUBS: these containers will crack<br/>
with heavy rocks placed on them.  I had covered "THE ACE OF CLUBS"<br/>
with a LOT of heavy rocks and cement chunks when I changed its hiding<br/>
spot. When checking on it today we found it had some cracks, so we<br/>
replaced the container.  It doesn't matter if these containers get wet<br/>
or freeze as long as the caps are screwed on tight.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
CLARK RESERVATION STATE PARK:<br/>
<br/>
I just noticed a typo in the "IT'S GOOD FOR A DOG, WALK" clues.<br/>
Go to #8 of the .pdf printout and you will see:<br/>
"This w130vel on."<br/>
<br/>
It should be:<br/>
"This will be the Cliff Trail. Up ahead stop and enjoy the view, but<br/>
you must travel on."<br/>
