&gt; Once when I was in  ENgland, a friend of mine took me to see the library <br/>
&gt;  at Cambridge University.... It is VERY difficult <br/>
&gt;  for the average student to find things, and the librarians set up little <br/>
&gt;  clue searches just like you were describing.  When you find the <br/>
&gt;  first book, it tells you to look up a second book but you have to go <br/>
&gt;  through the baffling system to find it.  Don't know what they do to <br/>
&gt;  prevent the books involved from being removed, but maybe they only put <br/>
&gt;  clues in books nobody has checked out since the time of Isaac Newton....<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I'm afraid I just don't have time to keep up with the list traffic -- you <br/>
&gt;  folks are prolific! -- and I'm quite ashamed of how lax I've been about <br/>
&gt;  upholding my responsibilities as California rep on the letterboxing map <br/>
&gt;  (actually, I've asked to be removed from that).  I got to go on vacation <br/>
&gt;  this year, for the  first time in 3 years, and we did go to England, but <br/>
&gt;  couldn't get to Dartmoor.  But somehow, when  you come back from <br/>
&gt;  vacation, there's even MORE to do.  I just don't have time for<br/>
letterboxing, <br/>
&gt;  over here or over there or anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Problem: I can't find anything that tells me how to get off of this mailing <br/>
&gt;  list.  Sorry to be such a dim bulb, here, but I guess I wiped off <br/>
&gt;  whatever mail I had about list business like unsubbing.  Could somebody <br/>
&gt;  wipe me off of the list, or clue me in?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Have fun, y'all, I'm sure I'll be back, maybe in the summer,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>

Mary Ellen,<br/>
There is no failure in recognizing your priorities.  Thank you for the input<br/>
you have given us.  I think it's fascinating to hear that they are<br/>
"Letterbooking" at Cambridge.  I'm going to try and learn more about this.<br/>
<br/>
I see that Dan has removed you from the Contacts map as you have requested.  I<br/>
have also disabled your messages from the Talk List.  I did not remove you<br/>
altogether, however, since you suggested you may rejoin us.  Unless you ask me<br/>
to change this, you will still appear on our membership list, but will not<br/>
receive messages that are addressed to the group.  This way, if you should<br/>
later wish to rejoin the conversation, you can just let Dan or me know and we<br/>
can turn you back on with the press of a button.  Don't forget that you also<br/>
have the option of receiving Daily Digests of the messages on the list, as<br/>
opposed to receiving each message individually (much less mailbox clutter).<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch<br/>
