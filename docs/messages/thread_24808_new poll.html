Mystery boxes being the except to the following comment.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't change anything about how/where boxers plant; but, maybe<br/>
clues could be improved so others could more accurately plot the point<br/>
where you park the gas guzzling car to map the most direct route.  If<br/>
you have a GPS in your car, just look up the coordinates.  OR, if the<br/>
park has an address, include the actual street address.  OR, be sure<br/>
there are correct street names included for the nearest intersection.<br/>
 Verify with one of the online map sites to be sure it can be identified.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of online map sites, I found this interesting site yesterday<br/>
while I was looking for Rails to Trails.<br/>

OK, this survey is pretty stupid.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, why would I plant a letterbox that caters to the <br/>
finder?  I plant boxes because I enjoy the subject, or the location, or <br/>
something about it is important to me.  I don't care if you have to go <br/>
out of your way to find the box, plan out a route, or any of that.  I <br/>
used to provide driving directions but have in time decided that, you <br/>
know what, you are searching for the box, so you should really have to <br/>
search for the box, and if that means pulling out a map to find the park <br/>
the box is in, then so be it.  Why should I hold your hand to direct you <br/>
to the park, to plan how to get there, or anything like that?  People <br/>
should learn to use their brains and get out there and figure these <br/>
things out on their own.<br/>
