Description: On a Mystery University Campus<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clue: <br/>
<br/>
There is a bull on the loose- last seen on a University campus in <br/>
Florida. The students have chased him on his stampeed across campus <br/>
through the engineering &amp; past the medical area. He even eluded the <br/>
greeks before turning south toward the sun! He thought he had lost <br/>
them by heading down the dead end lollipop lane- but alas they <br/>
spotted him at the 10th iron lightpost. Fearing this was the end the <br/>
turned around and at 140 degrees he spotted the perfect hiding spot. <br/>
He crouched low between the three &amp; sure enough the students gave <br/>
up. But not you! You know exactly where he is hiding don't you?? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting! <br/>
