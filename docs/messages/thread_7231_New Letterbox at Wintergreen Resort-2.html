Name of the Letterbox:  Emily's Elephant Box<br/>
<br/>
Date Placed:  August 24, 2002<br/>
<br/>
State:  Virginia<br/>
<br/>
County:  Nelson<br/>
<br/>
Nearest Town:  Wintergreen/Nellysford<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox can be found on the Raven's Roost Trail at Wintergreen Resort (www.wintergreenresort.com).  Please see the friendly folks at the Trillium House Nature Center to get a trail map, which will direct you to the Raven's Roost Trail.<br/>
<br/>
To find the letterbox, follow the yellow trail blazes to the Shenandoah Valley overlook.  Enjoy the view of world-famous Shenandoah Valley.<br/>
<br/>
On your return from the overlook, take the "Return Loop" that goes to the left.  After you pass the narrow trail between two rocks, go 13 feet (not paces) and you'll see a few rocks in the trail and a large rock to the right of the trail.  Stop.   Look to the left of the trail, by the fallen tree.<br/>
