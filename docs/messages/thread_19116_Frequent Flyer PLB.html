So... if you are up for this one - send me an email!  Let's see how many<br/>
miles this stamp can rack up!  I will add everyone who responds to me<br/>
BEFORE June 30, 11:59pm MST.  This gives me PLENTY of time to plan for<br/>
it since I have two boxes to send out before I can even start on this<br/>
one.  This box will go out mid-late July.<br/>
<br/>
One REQUIREMENT (if you want to call it that).  I need your promise that<br/>
you will mail this box out within 48 hours of receiving it.  The list is<br/>
going to be long and I don't want those at the end to have to wait<br/>
forever. =]<br/>

directed to a special inbox so I can keep track of everyone.<br/>

We have 109 names!  (Everyone who emailed me made the list)<br/>
<br/>
It will take me a few days to figure out the best way to send it (so we<br/>
get the most milage), but I hope to have it out by mid-late July.<br/>
