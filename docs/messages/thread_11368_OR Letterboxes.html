Ryan's letterboxes while we were at it.  Heceta Head Lighthouse is <br/>
alive and well (with lots of visitors from all over the country); <br/>
Shore Acres Gardens is alive and well; and Coquille River Lighthouse <br/>
is alive and well.  We hunted for, but were unable to find, the box <br/>
at Cape Blanco.  However, I have little doubt that it is there <br/>
somewhere.  We were simply pressed for time and couldn't search the <br/>
area as thoroughly as possible.<br/>
