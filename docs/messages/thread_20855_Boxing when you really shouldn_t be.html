My logical mind insists that modern nurse clothes are probably <br/>
scrubs in any color and comfy shoes, but part of me really wants to <br/>
see you in old-fashioned whites (dress, chunky shoes, stockings, and <br/>
of course the CAP!) trying to stay pristine in the woods.<br/>

Situation: 1) Kids at the sitters to be picked up in 25 minutes; 2) <br/>
series of letterboxes in a park sort of on the way to the sitters; 3) <br/>
need to change out of dress clothes first.  Figured I could at least <br/>
find ONE of the boxes before I had to get the kids...<br/>
<br/>
Actuality:  Changed clothes in the car in the park in record time.  <br/>
20 minutes left.  Realized I was in the wrong section of the park, so <br/>
drove to the next area.  Ignored strange-looking men fishing from the <br/>
bank and took off (alone) into the woods on what I thought was the <br/>
correct path.  15 minutes later realized that it was the wrong path <br/>
since none of the landmarks showed up.  Decided to turn around and <br/>
head back, but couldn't just give up.  Checked out several tree <br/>
trunks on the way back anyhow.  Am now 10 minutes late - called the <br/>
sitter from the car and told her "something came up" and I'd be a <br/>
little late.  Pulled in to her drive half an hour late which cost me <br/>
extra and no new stamp to show for it.  <br/>
<br/>
Would I do it again?  Without the creepy-looking men, probably.<br/>

OK - I'll fess up - I went out after a short workday today in my workclothes - but I should <br/>
not have been wearing old clogs.  You can really twist an ankle on the gravel, rooted trails.  <br/>
Had my backpack of supplies, walking stick and camera (decoy) - I didn't realize there are <br/>
so many dog walkers in the early afternoon.  Found 2 of 2; a happy day.<br/>

Situation: (1) Letterboxing obsessed mom searches in vain for<br/>
Legerdemaine box for an hour 2) A known letterbox is 1/2 a mile hike<br/>
away  (3) 3 year old needs to be picked up from preschool in 25<br/>
minutes. Can mom hike 1/2 a mile, find the box, stamp in and hike back<br/>
to the car in time to drive the 10 minutes to the preschool? We won't<br/>
know unless we try!<br/>

Would you believe I have letterboxed in a silk skirt suit and heels?  <br/>
I had a long lunch break while I was in Salt Lake City for a business <br/>
conference.  The hotel we were at was just up the street from two <br/>
letterboxes.  How could I resist?<br/>
<br/>
I think the stranger looking one was in Salmon, ID.  I planted <br/>
letterboxes while I was there on business also.  Salmon is a small <br/>
town in Idaho's central mountains.  It is the ending stop for many <br/>
major rafting trips.  I was again in my work skirt (one that was at <br/>
least a little less formal than the SLC one) and went exploring in <br/>
the mountains to plant some boxes.  Even though my outfit was more <br/>
casual, I stuck out like a sore thumb, but I couldn't not get out and <br/>
box.  I ask again-how could I resist?<br/>

Week before last I had to travel 7.5 hours from my home to see a very <br/>
specialized doctor.  I got to town about an hour early, so of course <br/>
I headed off into the woods in search of a letterbox.  Not only was <br/>
it warmer at my destination than it had been at home, i.e. I was <br/>
overdressed - but it started raining on me.  I showed up at the <br/>
doctor's office drenched with sweat and rain - I'm afraid they <br/>
thought I was having odd symptoms!<br/>
