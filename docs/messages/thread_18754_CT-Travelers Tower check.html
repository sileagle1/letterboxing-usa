I "set it free" a little over a month ago, and have been anxious to <br/>
not only make sure it's still safe, but to sit and read the <br/>
logbook. What a nice way to spend my lunch hour flipping through the <br/>
book, admiring stamps and reading notes while basking in the <br/>
sunshine!  I MUST SAY.... I was thrilled to see the box was <br/>
PERFECTLY put back together.  ALL the baggies were closed up all <br/>
comfy cozy, and neatly arranged in the box.  THANK YOU!  And to who <br/>
ever was thoughtful enough to place that big ole bark on top of the <br/>
box... SPECIAL THANKS!  OK, enough warm fuzzies for now, let's get <br/>
boxing!!!!   :)    MayEve<br/>
