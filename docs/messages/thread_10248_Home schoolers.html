what you and your kids have gotten out of boxing? I was explaining that<br/>
although I am not home schooling my kids that the kids and I learn something<br/>
new just about every-time we go boxing. A lot of the boxes are based on<br/>
literature and characters from history. I have visited great forts and<br/>
wonderful locations that I never would have known about with out boxing.<br/>
Navigation and map reading is another learning tool I have been using with<br/>
my kids.  How about you?<br/>

I use boxing as a 4-H activity and here are the educational <br/>
components I saw at the get go. Reading, following directions, maps, <br/>
history, nature ( tree id etc) map reading, compass work, suggested <br/>
good books,math , land preservation issues, occasionaly, music, <br/>
codes, and research,and biography info. Then in the planting of boxes <br/>
here are the  bonus parts. Writing skills, writing in sequence, <br/>
spelling, measuring, computer use, art and craft, .   Now we have <br/>
even discussed the benefit of getting up and going outside to walk so <br/>
we cover the P.E. component as well.  This is a perfect educational <br/>
opportunity with all areas crossing over and  learning becoming fun <br/>
and family based. What more can we ask.  Have those interested look <br/>
at this variety in Ct. clues  Ft.GRiswold/Ft. Trumbull, Froggy Went a <br/>
Courtin, Summer Music, Revolutionary Women, Bed Rugg, Plane Spotter <br/>
and there are so many more.  Have fun and good luck  leader of the <br/>
pack<br/>

We are also a home schooling family.  These other families <br/>
have pretty much said all of the ways I could think letterboxing <br/>
can be used in a home schooling environment.  The only thing <br/>
I'd add is that we were able to use Letterboxing to fulfill some <br/>
requirements in Cub Scouts too =)<br/>
<br/>
Home schooling and letterboxing go great together!<br/>
