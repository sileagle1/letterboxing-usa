&gt; perfect for letterboxing, so come on up ! We travelled to Victoria, on<br/>
&gt; Vancouver Island, last weekend - the flowering cherry trees are flowering<br/>
&gt; and bulbs are up. While there we checked on Canada Goose's "20 Bucks" It<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; high and dry and has seen visitors from all over North America. We also<br/>
&gt; picked up a couple of boxes, as well as planted a couple of micro boxes, "<br/>
&gt; Beacon &amp; Jester" - see attached. Looking forward to a spring gathering -<br/>
&gt; maybe up here?<br/>
&gt; Happy Hunting, the Secret Gardeners<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Beacon &amp; Jester Micro Letterboxes, Victoria, BC Canada<br/>
Placed January 11, 2003 by the Secret Gardeners.<br/>
This letterbox follows the 20 Bucks Letterbox placed by the Canada Goose<br/>
last July.<br/>
After putting 20 Bucks safely back, circle round the bay and find your way<br/>
up to the memorial benches at Finlayson Point. Follow six " zigzags " from<br/>
the edge and poke below to find the Beacon. Note this is very busy spot and<br/>
you may need to be patient, also - we hope you are not afraid of dogs!!!!!!<br/>
Now look up and salute the flag, head that way and when you reach the pole,<br/>
search out Taylor Dawn's teddy bear. Sit with the teddy and appreciate the<br/>
view. In front and left you will spot a good size piece of granite framed by<br/>
broom.  Check the feet and you will meet the Jester.<br/>
