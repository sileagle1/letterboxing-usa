<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for the cross post.  My little ones are bored to death this<br/>
summer. and, they LOVE to get mail. only the grandparents can't send enough<br/>
to keep them busy!  So. I was thinking. would any of you be willing to send<br/>
post cards?  They love to hang them up in their room next to their US Map. I<br/>
was thinking it would be fun to see how many states we could get post cards<br/>
from. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, please email me at dscott5377 at earthlink dot net.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

Hello.  My name is Tiffany (a.k.a. TrailTamer when out letterboxing :).  How <br/>
old are your kids?  My daughter is 8 and will be starting 3rd grade in the <br/>
fall.  I thought that if yours were old enough, it would be fun for them to <br/>
get a pen-pal to write back and forth to. (remember the days?).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, let me know what you (and the kids) think of the idea.  We are <br/>
located in Missouri.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
