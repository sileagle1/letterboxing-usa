                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  What a weekend!  Despite all the visiting, eating, exchanging, <br/>
and laughing, we DID go out and get a few letterboxes.  It was great <br/>
seeing old friends and even greater meeting new ones!  Many thanks <br/>
to all who traveled to Liberty Lake, and also many thanks to the <br/>
locals who spent the day and joined in on the potluck. <br/>
<br/>
A special 'Thank you' to Homeschoolmommy and Mike for hosting such a <br/>
fun event.  Thanks for carving, planting, and organizing, you <br/>
planned for every detail!  Thanks to all who sent special stamps, <br/>
Teamware's FLOAT BOAT is just so cool, nothing else like it in <br/>
Spokane. And thanks to Der Mad Stamper for the beautuful Event <br/>
Stamp, that stamp is a delight and I feel lucky to have it!  Thanks <br/>
to Wood Aug and Slo Mo for adding the Uncle Liberty Box, and sharing <br/>
your personal connection to Spokane Valley history.  Many thanks to <br/>
the Flying Squirrel Squad for so generously sharing your logbook <br/>
techniques, and a personal many thanks to Sue 4 Stampin for her card <br/>
making advice!  Mike and Elaine--I did not think it was possible, <br/>
but you may have inspired $DB to start dreaming about Mt Rainier.  <br/>
And Thunderbird and ThunderEagle...I missed getting your stamp!  <br/>
How'd that happen??  <br/>
<br/>
It amazes me and warms my heart to see such q diverse group of <br/>
people, the young, the older, the fit, the sedate, yet letterboxers <br/>
all, sitting in the lantern light laughing out loud and truly <br/>
enjoying each other's company.  We are blessed.  Gratefully, colls<br/>
