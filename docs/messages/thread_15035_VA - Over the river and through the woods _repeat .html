Grandma's house (that's our next trip)  instead, BeMa was traveling through <br/>
the trees and over the 16 bridges at the Shamokin Springs Nature Preserve at <br/>
Wintergreen!  Last year, with the drought, these gurgling, bubbling streams <br/>
had all been dry and bridges a mystery.  But, this year, with all the rain, <br/>
the preserve literally sang with the flowing of the water!  Having ensured <br/>
that all BeMa members hit the bathroom before we hit the trail, we were <br/>
really able to enjoy these peaceful sounds!<br/>
<br/>
We were really excited to be back at Wintergreen as it was one year ago in <br/>
that same place that we first stepped foot on a path that was not a track in <br/>
a gym or an aisle at a supermarket (or Toys R Us...) and we've been loving <br/>
it ever since.  Of course, we didn't start letterboxing until after we got <br/>
home, but, in that year's time, several more boxes had been planted at <br/>
Wintergreen -- yeah!!<br/>
<br/>
We merrily counted our bridges and came to the gap between number 6 and <br/>
number 7 -- even checking the little metal tags on each bridge.  We looked <br/>
for a gnarly tree with roots and proceeded to look and look for Megan's <br/>
Magpie.  No luck!  Da was on one side on the bridge, Na was on the other.  <br/>
Who knows where the kids were 'cause we were so intense peeking under rocks <br/>
and around roots!...  Darn how the physical well being of one's offspring <br/>
can get overlooked in the thrill of the search!  We did everything but wade <br/>
in the water (I did forage downstream to see if it had been washed <br/>
away...)Luckily, the kids were still above water and safe when we finally <br/>
agreed that we had been beaten.  No Magpie could be found.  Oh well, we put <br/>
on a bright face and exclaimed that we were there to "enjoy nature" anyway <br/>
(yeah right -- nature is a lot more fun with a stamp in the journal....)  <br/>
But, we soon got over our selves and hopped along up the trail toward's <br/>
Megan's Mousie.<br/>
<br/>
Now that cute little mousie was right were it was supposed to be (once we <br/>
figured out which way to go on the AT) and we hid her a little more <br/>
carefully, seeing that the rains had washed away some of her leaf and twig <br/>
nest.<br/>
<br/>
Back over more bridges and to then end, we loaded everyone up in the car and <br/>
convinced the kids to try for another box on a nearby trail since we hadn't <br/>
found the Magpie. A little bit of whining (and a promise of a trip to the <br/>
indoor pool and a souvenir later) and everyone was belted up and ready to <br/>
go.  Just then, Da asked to look at the clues one more time.  He had this <br/>
funny look in his eye as he gazed toward the sign just in front of our <br/>
bumper reading "Shamokin Springs Nature Preserve Loop/ to Old Appalachian <br/>
Trail"...  "Sweetheart", he crooned. did you notice the part of the clues <br/>
that say you must start at this entrance of the clues "won't make any sense <br/>
at all"?  Whoops!  Sometimes a Mom can't be bothered to really read the <br/>
clues, just like a Dad can't be bothered to stop in at a gas station and ask <br/>
for directions!...  With a lesson to the kids about the importance of <br/>
actually paying attention to the directions, we tumbled back out of the car <br/>
and started counting bridges starting from the correct entrance to the <br/>
trail.  Voila!!  Megan's Magpie was just where it was supposed to be <br/>
"inside, under and behind" (clues which did make much more sense now....)<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone who is at the preserve, looking for these two boxes, please <br/>
ignore our little sad faced note at Maggie's Mousie and remember to start on <br/>
the right side!!  BeMa<br/>
