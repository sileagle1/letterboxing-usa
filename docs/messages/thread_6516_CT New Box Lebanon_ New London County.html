Capt. S.L. Gray of the whaling ship James Murray sailed out of New London<br/>
harbor with his crew, wife Sarah, and 16 year old daughter Katie and into<br/>
legend and folklore. As the story goes, the whaling ship James Murray was<br/>
engaged by the Confederate ship Shenandoah off the coast of Guam in the<br/>
Pacific. Captain Gray was mortally wounded in the action but the James<br/>
Murray was able to flee and escape further wrath from the enemy vessel.<br/>
(Some say the Captain died not of battle wounds but of diphtheria) Sarah<br/>
Gray would not hear of the traditional method of a burial at sea for her<br/>
husband. Sarah had a different idea. She had the crew open a barrel of rum,<br/>
place the body of Captain Gray in the rum filled barrel and resealed it.<br/>
When the ship returned to New London, the cask with the body still inside<br/>
was shipped to Lebanon Connecticut. With Captain S.L. Gray still in the<br/>
barrel, rum and all, he was buried as is, in the Liberty Hill Cemetery.<br/>
There is also a mystery concerning Mrs. Gray. Five sons and daughters all<br/>
died before or around their second birthdays under mysterious circumstances.<br/>
The belief was that Sarah had some sort of responsibility for their deaths.<br/>
The eldest daughter Katie was always on the ship with her father at sea<br/>
which would have kept her safe. Katie died only 4 years after her fathers<br/>
death. The widow Gray lived for another 20 years after her husbands death.<br/>
All are buried on the family plot in Liberty Hill. The inscription on Capt.<br/>
Grays headstone reads Capt. S.L. Gray  died on board ship James Murray <br/>
near the island of Guam  March 24, 1865  Age 51 years, 4 mo.<br/>
