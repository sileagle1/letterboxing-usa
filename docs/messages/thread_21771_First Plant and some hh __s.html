Hi there,..Just planted my first letterbox ever and am somewhat <br/>
excited <br/>
about it.It's a vparticulalry  urban plant,<br/>
I plan on making it part of a series boxes of a similar theme, <br/>
depending on <br/>
how this one fairs.<br/>
<br/>
No tthe prettiest stamp,.. but hand carved if that count's for <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
but when I listed it on lbna, i also tried to list a hitchhiker I <br/>
carved and <br/>
planted today as well,.. but couldn't find a simple way to do so.<br/>
<br/>
 I assume there must at least be some kind of backhanded way to list <br/>
one so <br/>
it shows up specifically as a hitch hiker and not a normal box.<br/>
<br/>
Anyoen know how one would go about this?<br/>
I couldn't find anything on it in the faq.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time and patience,..<br/>
and let me know what youthink of the box.<br/>
<br/>
I am super proud of my meager effort.<br/>

HH are not normally listed on LBNA, but are often included on Pete's Hitchhiker page:<br/>

You may want to send him an email to have yours listed.<br/>

There's also the option of tracking individual HHs, Virtuals, Postal,  traveler, as well as standard letterboxes at AtlasQuest.<br/>

<br/>
To me it counts a lot! I will almost not search for a box if I know it<br/>
has a store-bought stamp in it. Thanks for your effort! I appreciate<br/>
it even if I never get to find your box!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Anyone know how one would go about this?<br/>
&gt; I couldn't find anything on it in the faq.<br/>
I second the www.atlasquest.com suggestion. They have HH tracking<br/>
built right into the system. I have seen some HH listed on the LBNA<br/>
website somehow, if I remember correctly, but I would def. say to<br/>
contact Wand and Pete. Not sure how often that page is updated, though.<br/>

Keep in mind that each box has an intended audience. <br/>
Here's a fantastic concept on how to gear your box towards those<br/>
folks:  (thanks Ryan)<br/>

<br/>
You wouldn't want mothers and their young kids searching around under<br/>
the rafters of rif raf and broken glass - would you? It might be<br/>
stated obviously to you (the planter) that this isn't their "kind" of<br/>
box, however - you might be surprised to not have any finders for a<br/>
long while in this case. <br/>
<br/>
An urban box is especially challenging not only for a first plant, but<br/>
also for people who aren't used to your style. As you plant more<br/>
boxes, people will come to know your type of clue/box/etc. and you can<br/>
expect more visitors that will appreciate your efforts. <br/>

You're welcome.  I've been meaning to update and rewrite that page for<br/>
the last year and add it to Atlas Quest.  I'm such a flake.  I thought<br/>
everyone had forgotten about it by now.  =)<br/>
