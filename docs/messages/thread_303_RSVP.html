I warned you all I had not experimented with this feature yet!!<br/>
As near as I can tell, the election is (inadvertently) 'rigged'.<br/>
<br/>
I made the mistake of including quotation marks in some of the<br/>
descriptions.  This apparently confuses the tabulator.  Everything<br/>
after the first quote mark disappears.  This was not a complete<br/>
loss for any of the options except Thank You, in which the first<br/>
character was a quote mark.  I honestly can't say if it is keeping<br/>
track of this selection, but not printing it, or ignoring it <br/>
completely!!  (As for Adrian's complaint, I don't see him listed<br/>
under the Virtual Community option)<br/>
<br/>
Should we continue with our damaged poll, end it and start over, or<br/>
drop the whole thing and just talk it over?  (No, I'm not going to<br/>
poll the group to answer this question!!)<br/>
