<br/>
My Box Maintenance Hospital that I announced last week is very low on <br/>
patients. We could use an influx of long distance boxes that need <br/>
some TLC or just a look-see from area letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Email me if you have a long distance box that you would like checked <br/>
out, report any comments and I will post it on this page. The <br/>
response has been overwhelming but the hospital needs some more <br/>
patients. There are only 3 occupied beds right now!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would appreciate a look @ RoseMay's Shower LB on Mt. Sunapee in NH. , <br/>
Sullivan County.  The clues my be still listed under Cheshire county on the <br/>
letterbox site.   It might be too cold &amp; icey yet  to check it out.  My daughter <br/>
lives near there so I can  if I ask enough times get her to check it out .  I live <br/>
on Long Island, NY so I really don't get up there too often.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
