I thought it would be a great topic for a paper I have to write for <br/>
class.  I was just wondering if anyone would be willing to be <br/>
contacted regarding their experience letterboxing and how they found <br/>
out about it. Please resond here or by email (Coolbean702@aol.com) if <br/>
you wouldn't mind bein contacted.  Thanks- Lindsay<br/>
