Another new guy here...thought I'd ask if anybody chooses to use <br/>
negative image stamps (where the white space is the image) instead of <br/>
the other way. I carved one tonight and kind of want to preserve the <br/>
white spaced image instead of outlining it as I usually do. I don't <br/>
like the swath of ink surrounding the white image, but I can maybe do <br/>
some background work to make it bearable. The image is very cool in<br/>
the white inversed way it is presented. Anyone out there ever have this<br/>
quandry?<br/>

Thanks for the advice and the reply. Maybe concentric circles coming <br/>
out of a moon or something to fill in the space...hmmm. Good idea. <br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>

&gt; negative image stamps (where the white space is the image) instead<br/>
&gt; of the other way.<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of people who do that--particularly beginner carvers <br/>
since they're generally easier to carve.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don't like the swath of ink surrounding the white image, but I<br/>
&gt; can maybe do some background work to make it bearable.<br/>
<br/>
I'm so glad you said that, because while there's nothing wrong with <br/>
negative images per se, that swath of ink surrounding the white image <br/>
*usually* looks absolutely awful.  It's great to see you've noticed <br/>
that problem and want to do something about it!  =)  I've seen <br/>
several ways in which people have handled the problem including:<br/>
<br/>
1. Make a "frame" around the image.  Thin lines near the edges of the <br/>
stamp will do wonders, but you can also make more exotic and creative <br/>
frames to.  Or at least turn the edge into a "wavy" line rather than <br/>
the plain, straight ones.<br/>
<br/>
2. Make sure that swath of ink isn't rectangular.  For some reason, a <br/>
swath of rectangular ink looks so much worse than ovals, hexagons, or <br/>
even an irregular shape.  With those other shapes, it looks like you <br/>
MEANT for it look like it does while the rectangular ones look like <br/>
you just never finished the carving.<br/>
<br/>
3. A random background pattern will work wonders on such a stamp.  <br/>
Someone suggested concentric circles (as if radiating from a moon or <br/>
something) which works well, but just about any pattern will work <br/>
effectively.  Two of my favorite stamps I've ever seen used this <br/>
method.  The one was of a turtle with wavy lines in the background <br/>
representing the water--ever effective, while the other was a frog <br/>
with just a random pattern of circles and half circles.  Kind of <br/>
looked like something you'd see on that special origami paper, <br/>
actually, but it was a beautiful stamp!<br/>
<br/>
4. The only stamps I've ever created using the negative image was my <br/>
Petroglyph series in Nevada in order to make it look more like real, <br/>
genuine petrogylphs.  Since the real-life ones were created <br/>
by "picking out" the desert varnish so the lighter-colored rock <br/>
underneath could show through, it seemed logical that that's how my <br/>
stamps should look!  To avoid that horrible "block" look, I cut the <br/>
stamp into a roughly oval shape (not a perfect oval, though, since <br/>
when has a petroglyph been carved into a perfect oval?), and roughed <br/>
up the background by scratching and gouging so the "rock" didn't look <br/>
so smooth and perfect.  (Again, I wanted it to have that real-life <br/>
petroglyph look.)<br/>
<br/>
4. Another really neat effect I've seen is where HALF the image is <br/>
positive while the other half is negative.  Kind of a "day/night" <br/>
look to it since they're carved in opposite ways.  Generally I think <br/>
it works better on landscape kind of images than say, an animal.  <br/>
I've always dreamed of creating my own stamp like this but have yet <br/>
to actually try it myself.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, you can use more than one of these strategies if you <br/>
so choose.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  =)<br/>
