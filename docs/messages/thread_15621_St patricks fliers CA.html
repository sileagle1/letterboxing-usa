good shape.<br/>
We also went in search of st. Patricks fliers. We had trouble finding the <br/>
first one (we were looking in the wrong tree) and the second one is <br/>
unfortunatly in the same tree that a family of bees have built a hive. We <br/>
were able to get to the box but be very CAREFULl while searching for this <br/>
one.<br/>
I was going to contact Pandora (the placer) but didn't copy her e-mail from <br/>
the box. Hopefully the message will be sent along from here.<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise we had fun and as G sais it's always an adventure.<br/>

No need in contacting Pandy. She no longer lives in this area and is <br/>
really not that involved in the boxes' upkeep. I sort of inherited <br/>
them when she went to Portland.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the bees. That is a twist on the fliers. On a similar <br/>
note, this weekend up at the Norcal event, JugglerMouse was bit by a <br/>
yellowjacket. Thanks to A-Bear, who had some anti-sting meds, the <br/>
bite seems to be fine. More of my reflections on the event in another <br/>
post.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I think it might be a nice touch to have a small seminar at the <br/>
October 4th event on using a compass. I know it looks simple but it <br/>
is sometimes the simple things that get one.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you are out getting those boxes. Thanks for the update.<br/>
