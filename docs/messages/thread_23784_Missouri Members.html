                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi! I am a brand new member of this letterbox community and new to <br/>
letterboxing as well. I found an article about letterboxing in a <br/>
FAMILY FUN magazine at the drs office last week. I have two kids--a <br/>
girl, 9, and a boy, 12. I thought it would be fun to get them out of <br/>
the house and off the playstation. We found two sets of clues online <br/>
for two boxes hidden in Frontier Park(not five min. from our house). <br/>
Unfortunately, neither box was there anymore. Kind of disappointing, <br/>
however, since there was a Lewis and Clark reenactment festival, we <br/>
ended up having a great time---which is the basis for letterboxing, <br/>
right? So, if there are any Missourians out there who have planted or <br/>
found letterboxes, please contact me and give me some easy sites.<br/>

thanks,<br/>

one's missing right now, but I'll replace it soon) in Tower Grove Park<br/>
in St. Louis, MO.  These are really easy, straightforward clues.  I<br/>
have plans for 2 more city parks in the next month as well.<br/>

looked for?  Letterboxing.org?  You can also check Atlasquest.com.  On <br/>
there, you can do a search by city and it will show you all the boxes <br/>
within a certain number of miles from that city.  It also might have <br/>
some boxes listed on there that are not listed on letterboxing.org.<br/>
