took her to get me there! (grin).<br/>
<br/>
 ....FOURTH, you say!? And your story is that it took HER to get YOU <br/>
to the alter????  Hmmmmm..... are you sure?  What about this super <br/>
secret hidden PROPOSAL box we heard about?  Who planted THAT one I <br/>
wonder? (grin)  Now, am I the only one who thinks RavenMom should <br/>
get kudos for being willing to take a chance on a guy with such a <br/>
historically risky marital resume?? LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Blessinging to both of you, may your lives be ever filled with love, <br/>
joy and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
