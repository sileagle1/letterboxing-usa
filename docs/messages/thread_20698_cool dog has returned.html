The Cool Dog letterbox has finally been returned to his home in <br/>
Crandall Park, Tolland, CT.  He has a new friend with him and a new <br/>
neighbor he is not so crazy about.  The neighbor is not a hitch <br/>
hiker so please leave the box there. (Three stamps total and bring a <br/>
photo or sticker of your favorite cool dog or hint(meow) animal.  <br/>
And of course your animal stamp if you have one. I just have to <br/>
adjust the previous clues slightly and then I will post them. Its <br/>
RUFFF keeping up with all this letterboxing stufff!<br/>
