I hope that no one thinks of accusing me of being involved because<br/>
that store was sure gone before I stepped on the scene.<br/>

My first exposure to this list was an absurd overblown fairy tale about <br/>
lost PZ cut. Heck I didn't even know what PZ cut was, and this <br/>
supposedly friendly list of people were going on and on and on about it.<br/>
<br/>
I introduced myself, and while a few people snarled their hello, most of <br/>
them just continued on, having more fun spinning a tale than welcoming a<br/>
newbie. I had to retreat to the newboxer's list for awhile, among that <br/>
purported villain Mark Pepe. I can assure you, the only thing he's <br/>
guilty about is writing a boring blog!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I have a suspect at the top of my list, and it is "Lady" <br/>
Prisspot nee Hedge.  She is so hoity toity all the time, looking down <br/>
her nose at us letterboxing apparachiks, I think she has an <br/>
overabundance of Good Manners, and they have turned on her.<br/>
<br/>
I've had my say on this matter, and leave it to the so called experts.<br/>

<br/>
I must first say  my patience with you wears thin.  I mind my own business<br/>
and keep to myself  sort of  and yet I again find myself on the wrong end<br/>
of your long, skinny, pointy finger.   I seriously question your abilities<br/>
if your sleuthwork again lands you at MY doorstep!  In fact, I find it<br/>
interesting that as you cast around looking for the possessor of the Store<br/>
of Good Manners, you repeatedly land on someone who doesn't possess the<br/>
store, but who each demonstrate the character of one who has visited it<br/>
often.   I have to think you might be so confused about your mission that it<br/>
is possible YOU hold the Store yourself and don't even realize it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of the Store of Good Manners, I notice that you haven't yet<br/>
answered Der Mad Stamper's question regarding when the Store went missing.<br/>
I have another question for you still  WHERE was it last seen?   I find it<br/>
very difficult to defend myself without knowing when I shouldn't have been<br/>
where it was, and I'm sure the other fine folk you have fingered firmly<br/>
follow suit in that feeling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm just a country girl from Texas, not a thief and certainly not a<br/>
thief of something as noble as the Store of Good Manners.   When I breathe<br/>
the sweet clean air of East Texas, I breathe in manners and civility at the<br/>
same time and you know the saying  what goes in must come out.  That anyone<br/>
would suppose that a good Texan would dare to steal the Store of Good<br/>
Manners is silly and I am embarrassed that I have been asked to defend<br/>
myself.   I may not have the pickled brain it would take to share worms and<br/>
wear red high-heeled pumps and I may not creep around in the woods following<br/>
beer-swilling bottle hiders around, but I am not a thief.   And I may not<br/>
hide behind anything as high-brow as educating the uninitiated or curating a<br/>
museum, but I respect the property of others.  And I may not be able to use<br/>
big words like antimassacre and ostricheperousness or gallantly escort<br/>
ladies about, but I recognize and applaud social niceties.   And I may not<br/>
have a suspicious dog with a story or a friend who doesn't "remember" a lot<br/>
of things that I've done, but I still have good manners!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You cite my barefootedness as a point of uncivil behavior  but would YOU<br/>
wear red high-heeled shoes that mysteriously disappeared and then reappeared<br/>
wreaking of sweaty man feet?   You might, but I wouldn't!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And you mention as evidence that I wrap Christmas presents in duct tape?  Well<br/>
did you KNOW that I have a cousin who is a rep for the duct tape company and<br/>
he gladly provides me with free duct tape in festive yule designs?   I doubt<br/>
you knew that, and that point only indicates my frugalness.  Is frugality<br/>
impolite?  I answer with a resounding NO!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is true, and you are right that I have admitted, that my manners are in<br/>
disarray, but when I admitted to messy manners I was referring to the sort<br/>
of manners that indicate where the butter knife goes and what wine to serve<br/>
with which type of meat (and for that matter, anyone who attended the third<br/>
Annual Texas Gathering and visited the Maydelle Winery knows that any wine<br/>
goes with anything  as long as it is fruity and sweet).   It's true, I<br/>
don't know how long I have to write thank you notes after receiving a gift,<br/>
but I do always offer a hearty thank you at some point. So please, don't<br/>
confuse Ms. Post type etiquette with a lack of down home good manners that<br/>
many of my fellow Texans share with me.   I may not know what to do with all<br/>
5 forks in my place setting, but I DO know better than to stab my neighbor<br/>
with any of them!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well my home is another matter.  It is truly a mess, but it was oh so<br/>
freeing to admit that fact openly and to find that I share that plight with<br/>
many other letterboxing women, and to find that I am not alone in thinking<br/>
that there are things more important than a clean home.   Clearly, we who<br/>
have messy homes find it much more important to just get out there and box <br/>
and in so doing, we find boxes that help us answer those infernally frequent<br/>
TOTW questions by Mr. "I-teach-newbies" Pepe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And yet your accusations go on  Yes, I did take over a neighbor's house,<br/>
but they weren't using it at the time, and they would've never known if they<br/>
hadn't found the bottles DMS hid in their potted palm tree.   And I fully<br/>
intended on leaving it better than I had found it, and in my opinion I did<br/>
just that, complete with flamingos in the front yard and little dangly palm<br/>
tree lights around the barbeque deck.   And I painted their house besides,<br/>
and again demonstrated my frugality in that matter by buying the lovely<br/>
magenta paint that Sherwin Williams had on half price, and then I used my<br/>
Marvy Markers to add some artistic embellishments that any home owner could<br/>
love.   Can I help it if my neighbor envisions herself to be Ms. Post<br/>
herself?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I am getting a little tired of defending my educational techniques with<br/>
respect to my kids. Texas kids have to be tough.   They have to be able to<br/>
wrangle rattlesnakes and wrestle gators, but they have to be exposed to them<br/>
first.  I can think of no better way to help them understand what they are<br/>
up against than to leave them in the woods where those critters live and let<br/>
them fend for themselves.   SJZ managed to find her way home most days, and<br/>
only a couple of times did I have to call the sheriff to help me find<br/>
her.  Don't<br/>
think I went easy on her though  if she didn't make it home by dinnertime<br/>
and bringing the meat for dinner, she got nothing to eat.   With Lightning<br/>
I've eased up a bit and I give him until dark to get home.  And an added<br/>
benefit is that they have learned superb navigational skills which have<br/>
served them well as letterboxers.   Can you please point to the downside of<br/>
losing them in the woods once or twice a week?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suppose mere words, however heartfelt, will not convince you that I am not<br/>
the holder of the Store of Good Manners.   May I point to my personal use of<br/>
good manners in letterboxing by mentioning that I am diligent about keeping<br/>
my boxes maintained and my clues updated?  Far be it from me to cause some<br/>
poor letterboxer to unproductively search for one of my boxes because I had<br/>
failed to accurately state the status of one of my boxes.   And I would<br/>
certainly hate for someone to come up on a broken container and have to<br/>
replace it on my behalf, so I check all 84 of my boxes once a week each to<br/>
make sure they are equipped well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And since I am sure you are not yet convinced of my innocence, I suppose I<br/>
am going to have to embarrass myself further and ask my letterboxing mentor<br/>
to speak on my behalf.   Certainly if you can't believe me when I say I am<br/>
innocent, you will believe Silver Eagle  a true gentleman of letterboxing<br/>
and an example to us all and the one who, along with his brother Baby Bear,<br/>
has taught me everything I know about genteel letterboxing.   I apologize,<br/>
Silver Eagle, for putting you in this position, but this relentless<br/>
Inspector Gadget will not believe that I hold dear good letterboxing manners<br/>
unless someone of your caliber speaks on my behalf.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
