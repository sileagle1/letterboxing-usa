experienced...<br/>
<br/>
16 Mar 03: "Green Tree Frog &amp; Siamese Cat" are both doing fine in <br/>
Montesano.  However, it proved to be an adventure to nab these.  <br/>
Apparently, we forgot our waders (or shorts &amp; Tevas) this day &amp; that <br/>
was precisely what we needed.  One stretch of the boardwalk was <br/>
under 2+' of water thanks to a very swollen Chehalis River &amp; Quigg <br/>
Lake!  It was the first letterbox I've had to go barefoot through <br/>
freezing murky water to reach!  Fortunately, we dodged the very <br/>
threatening deluges and stayed fairly dry during the trek.  <br/>
Fortunately, it ended when it did, however, as our car was in a foot <br/>
of water in the parking lot when we were through!  Thank God for 4 <br/>
WD!!!  ;)  Saw many Bald Eagles during this outing.  Oh, Siamese Cat <br/>
was cuddled up with a bunch of centipedes...yech... :|<br/>
<br/>
17 Mar 03:  Bombed out at Eliza B's "Lake Quinalt" LB.  Apparently, <br/>
it's been nicked.  Fairly certain we were in the correct place <br/>
(although the clues read quite differently these days).  The trail <br/>
has a new name now and a new owner (I believe--as we'd been to it <br/>
before a few years back and there's a new sheriff in town it <br/>
seems).  We searched all throughout the cubby hole among the roots <br/>
for the box, if it wasn't nicked, then the tree itself swallowed it <br/>
into its belly.  We were bummed as we'd seen this stamp before in <br/>
another boxer's log and were so anxious to nab it ourselves for our <br/>
own logs.  Eliza B-if you'd like to replace it, I hope to head back <br/>
there in May, so drop me a line and I'll try to place it myself, or <br/>
I'll make other arrangements to put it back in action.<br/>
<br/>
17 Mar 03:  Bombed out again at "Hole in the Wall".  Not because it <br/>
was nicked, but because we happened to go when typically trickly <br/>
little Ellen Creek proved to be a deluge thanks to snowmelt &amp; <br/>
massive deluges throughout the day.  Had I not been carrying a 27 lb <br/>
antsy, squirmy, wiggly baby on my back, by myself and wearing jeans <br/>
without a swimsuit underneath, I would have crossed it in a <br/>
heartbeat; but alas, I didn't want to get caught in the rough tide <br/>
with a baby who can't swim, so I'll have to attempt it on another <br/>
day.  Perhaps with outside assistance (ie hubby?).  The sad part was-<br/>
-I was there during the tidal window of opportunity.  Now, how often <br/>
does that ever happen?  In my life???  ;)  By the way, Forks' <br/>
library doesn't allow access to YahooGroups for anybody who's <br/>
interested...<br/>
<br/>
18 Mar 03:  Whew--North Head Lighthouse is alive and well!  We were <br/>
starting to get pretty bummed missing out on several LONG DISTANCE <br/>
boxes, so we were delighted to find this one on a gorgeous day with <br/>
an incredible view!  This is one of my all time favorite places (up <br/>
there with Bowman Bay at Deception Pass!!!).<br/>
<br/>
18 Mar 03:  Cape Disappointment disappointed unfortunately.  Make <br/>
certain you know what the national threat level is when you attempt <br/>
this one.  Today, orange? no access to trail! Anything red or orange <br/>
will close this trail for an indeterminate amount of time.  <br/>
Hopefully, we'll get back when/if the trail is opened before we move <br/>
this summer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, we're batting .500 on this recent trek.  Fortunately, our recent <br/>
regional placements will blow that average out of the water...  ;)  <br/>
Clues to follow, but you'll see we tried for a rainbox of counties!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails...<br/>
