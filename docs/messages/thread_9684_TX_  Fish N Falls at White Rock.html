that the clues are on target.  This is a great nature spot and you might <br/>
bring binoculars, a camera, and a journal if you like to write.  It's a nice <br/>
little hike and would be great for families.  Happy hunting!<br/>

Take I-30 to East Grand exit.  N. on East Grand - stay in middle lane.  East <br/>
Grand will change name to Garland Road.  Then get in left lane and take a <br/>
left on Winsted (there is a 7-11 on the corner).  Park in 1st parking lot on <br/>
right.  <br/>
Begin walking on paved path.  Pass the cut-off with the bridge - do not turn <br/>
right there.  Continue walking on paved bike path until you come to a sign on <br/>
the left that says "Pitch In" with trash bins.  Look to the right for sign <br/>
that says "Old Fish Hatchery Nature Area".  Go through opening and begin on <br/>
hiking trail.  Notice the beautiful nature view on the left.  Follow main <br/>
path.  At the first fork in the road, go left.  The creek follows you as you <br/>
walk.  At the next fork, take the road to the right.  Keep walking - listen <br/>
to the beautiful nature sounds.  You will come upon a 4-way fork in the road. <br/>
 Again, take the road to the right.  You will see a bench for resting on the <br/>
right and a little way down there's a trail memorial to Ada Henderson on the <br/>
left.  Do not turn left here, but continue on down path.  This is a great <br/>
bird-watching area - hope you brought binoculars!  Take a left at the next <br/>
fork in the road.  Watch out for the low-lying branches.  At the next fork in <br/>
the road, take a right.  Step over fallen logs in the path.  Again, you'll <br/>
come to a 4-way fork in the road - take a right.  Enjoy mossy area on left <br/>
and look for 'gators and snapping turtles!! - well, maybe just a fishy or <br/>
two.  Keep walking straight ahead and you'll come to 14 green wooden poles.  <br/>
Step through them and continue on path to a wider path where you'll take a <br/>
right.  Notice lake embankment on left and maybe a few joggers.  At the end <br/>
of the trail, go right on concrete path.  Follow concrete path along <br/>
chain-link fence on the left to where fence is down.  There is a no-swimming <br/>
sign.  Go through opening in fence at sign.  Follow trail about 15 paces from <br/>
sign.  There is a path leading off to the right.  Notice the waterfall, then <br/>
follow path to the end until you reach the water.  Walk about 12 paces <br/>
keeping right - water on left.  Then turn back to the water.  You'll need to <br/>
climb up a little, but the large tree trunk you see hides what you seek.   <br/>
