I've been looking through the list of boxes on the LB site (the <br/>
offical one I guess) for boxes that are easy for a injured person to <br/>
get to. I started letterboxing last summer (a friend got me hooked), <br/>
but I haven't been able to find any sense that first gathering <br/>
because winter came and tehn I injured my knee. I'm on a cane now <br/>
and would like to continue finding boxes. Can anybody point me in <br/>
the direction of boxing in the Hillsboro/Portland (oregon) area that <br/>
AREN'T drive by? I've found only a few so far that I think I can do.<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
