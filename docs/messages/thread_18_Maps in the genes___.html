&gt; maps are a universal medium and that they tend to not change much over<br/>
&gt; time.  So unless major roads change or your boxes reach the end of their service-life the maps here will remain useful. <br/>
<br/>
I also am amazed at the seemingly universal appeal of maps of all kinds.<br/>
Perhaps its the right half of our collectiive brains longing for an<br/>
anchor in an increasingly left-brained society?<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I got it from my Dad. He was a landscape architect and<br/>
city/regional planner. He was one of the regional planners during the<br/>
earliest days (1930's) of the TVA - he planned many of the man-made<br/>
lakes in that system (eg., Lake Norris). His mentor there was a man<br/>
named Benton MacKaye, who first proposed the Appalachian Long Trail, and<br/>
was a founder of the Wilderness Society. I grew up watching my Dad make<br/>
maps, and visiting with my neighbor, Benton, in Massachusets. <br/>
<br/>
Maps and mountaintops are in my genes. It continues today, working with<br/>
maps as a member of our town planning commission, and regionally to<br/>
identify and protect  wildlife travel corridors. Letterboxing seems<br/>
right to me.<br/>

 But certainly I agree with the Viking, that maps are fascinating...and<br/>
 there is no real reason why that is.   I cant deconstruct the feelings<br/>
 but they are enthralling on many intellectual and pleasurable<br/>
 level...For me  they conjour quite complex images from very simply<br/>
 lines and curves...it must be in the genes...I agree !<br/>
  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Besides obviously being very useful, maps can be entertaining if you just sit<br/>
and read names of places.... what are people thinking when they name their<br/>
towns? ... but for me, I think a map just reminds me of fantasies of buried<br/>
treasure... and now that I learned of letterboxing, it's TRUE! <br/>

&gt; I always save the maps ..., and I have maps of Chicago<br/>

&gt; I have a hard time following them. Which way is THAT?<br/>

We don't actually do demographics, Deborah, but thank you.<br/>

In California we sit at the beach facing the water, admire our wonderful waves and soak up the sun.<br/>
<br/>
When vacationing in Boston, at Waikiki Beach (yes, Waikiki Beach Massachusetts!) we saw, to our amazement, that people sat with their backs to the ocean, facing the parking lot!  <br/>
Boy, you East Coasters got gypped.  Your sun is facing the wrong way!<br/>
<br/>
Since most of you are from the eastern side of the US, you'll probably defend your sun's position. But, believe me, its much more fun to face the ocean!<br/>

&gt;Re:Maps etc..<br/>

&gt;I wonder if you'd like to share this curio ...only oblique but its<br/>
&gt;about how I find my way by instinct in the wild..and how I had a moment<br/>
&gt;when my instincts were challenged...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have a number of friends from New Zealand...and they blew my whole<br/>
&gt;'instinctive' feel for directions in one convesation ...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;They said simply...Oh yes..head for the sun at noon and your going<br/>
&gt;NORTH !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Waoh!...I live in the N Hemisphere and all my prejudices about where<br/>
&gt;the sun is was blown away...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wonder where the sun rises and sets on Europa or Mars or even the<br/>
&gt;Moon....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;...............................................<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Funny things set ideas...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Keep the sun in the sky..I say..best place for it !<br/>
