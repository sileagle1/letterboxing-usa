A surprising phone call lead me to Northern Wisconsin<br/>
this Saturday.  A friends that go to school at<br/>
Northland Baptist Bible College needed a ride down.  I<br/>
had finished my box that I wanted to plant up there. <br/>
They took me to a wonderful park/camp ground called:<br/>
Twelve Foot Falls.  This may be a new series for me in<br/>
the spring.  It is so gorgeous! The scenery is breath<br/>
taking.  I have pictures still in the camera.  I'll<br/>
send the image and the pic along with my Green Isle<br/>
Series when it is placed.  Maybe this weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
Take 41/141 N.  Follow 141 N to Crivitz.  You are an<br/>
hour away when you reach Coleman.  You have fifteen or<br/>
so minutes when you reach Wausaukee.  After Wausaukee,<br/>
there will be a sign for Northland on your right.  It<br/>
is the next left after that sign.  After taking that<br/>
left, follow this new road to a stop sign.  There you<br/>
will see a wooden arrow sign for Twelve Foot Falls. <br/>
Follow that until you reach it.  Once you enter, park<br/>
at the parking lot after the Camp ground entrace (left<br/>
side, you'll be parking on the right side down the<br/>
hill a bit.)<br/>
Clue:  Take the path to the right.  It is also for<br/>
vehicles.  Take the left path to the Rocks by the<br/>
falls.  You will know them for they are situated like<br/>
a conversational nook.  Follow the lower path towards<br/>
the left.  Once a tree blocks your progress you've<br/>
found the local of the box.  Look in and around the<br/>
tree.  It is there.  "Wow," is all one can say.<br/>
Die xo<br/>
