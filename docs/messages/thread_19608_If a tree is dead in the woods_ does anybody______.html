                    <div class="plaintext-content">Nowadays, it's never quite clear to me what a dead tree constitutes; <br/>
I mean outside the straightforward descriptors, dead and tree.  To a <br/>
pre-letterboxing me, a dead tree was a still upright, very tree-like <br/>
entity.  Though it may be leafless and its xylum run dry, in the <br/>
deep of winter it still exudes the essence of living tree.<br/>
<br/>
This description differs from the "dead trees" I've searched for in <br/>
some of my recent letterboxing adventures.  These "dead trees" are <br/>
what I formally would call "fallen trees," "logs," "branches," "lawn <br/>
gnomes," etc.  I personally think if a tree is no longer erect, it's <br/>
no longer a tree, it's just wood.  Perhaps since the original <br/>
posting of clues, the ever seditious mother nature has ravished <br/>
these former dead trees and left them as mere wood.  Of course these <br/>
clues aren't wrong, and finding trees dead, fallen, alive, or in any <br/>
other state is still part of the adventure, so I have no complaints <br/>
and propose no changes to terminology.  What I'm getting at is that <br/>
the remaining "dead trees" that struggle every day against the <br/>
elements to remain strong and upright truly deserve some distinction <br/>
from the ones who fell before them.<br/>

Your philosophical musings were oddly interesting to her Ladyship.<br/>
Whilst your point Re: proper terminology for expired flora is well<br/>
taken, if unresolved, her Ladyship failed to understand how you can<br/>
call it wood if it is no longer erect. Something about that usage rang<br/>
incongruous in the back of her Ladyship's beautifully coiffed head.<br/>
May we respectfully suggest the term "duff"?<br/>

p.s. if it's standing dead it's a "snag". If it's fallen, it's compost....or<br/>
mushroom food....or a great drumming spot for a grouse...or (Sorry, I'm an<br/>
incorrigible naturalist)<br/>

It is all part of the challenge of letterboxing. Much like doing a <br/>
crossword puzzle. Sometimes you have to "think outside the box" <br/>
What I mean is you have to think in a different way than you are used <br/>
to thinking.<br/>
