                    <div class="plaintext-content">Phyto &amp; Isosceles began our letterboxing early this year. My first<br/>
find was in January in Connecticut (thanks to the help of my young<br/>
brother) and the first box that I placed was BIRD WALK on 5.21.03  <br/>
<br/>
On the subject of # of visitors to these boxes, it's totally varied.<br/>
BIRD WALK has only seen a few here and there, but FORT ALLEN PARK in<br/>
Portland has had a multitude of visitors to the area over the past<br/>
month. I'm happy to say that even SECRET GARDEN has been found!!! <br/>
<br/>
It is my guess-timate that if there are other boxes in close<br/>
proximity, then people will be more likely to hit the nearby boxes.<br/>
Take for instance the ESTES LAKE LOON (Isosceles) - it's in ALfred,<br/>
Maine - who is going to come through Alfred unless they take the<br/>
(very) scenic tour of Southern Maine? It's all relative.<br/>
<br/>
So for those letterboxers out there that despair about Maine and other<br/>
states where the boxes seem very spread out and rarely visited,<br/>
concentrate on the nice ones that have been there for a while, and fit<br/>
others in somewhat nearby and hopefully everyone will have more traffic!<br/>
<br/>
By the way - I must say that COW POUND (by TwoMaineCats) is my very<br/>
FAVORITE BOX that I have ever found! Can we say COW HENGE?!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing to All!<br/>
