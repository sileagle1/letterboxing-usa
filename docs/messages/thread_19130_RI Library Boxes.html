<br/>
  I also live in RI and know of a couple of libraries<br/>
  that have boxes in them.  I haven't been to find them<br/>
  yet but I've heard good things about them.  I don't<br/>
  know of any plans to include all libraries (that<br/>
  sounds very ambitious!). In my travels recently, I was<br/>
  chatting with a woman who had never heard of<br/>
  letterboxing before and who was very intrigued with<br/>
  the whole idea.  She is on the board of a local<br/>
  library and seemed interested in planting a stamp in<br/>
