Name of the letterbox is:  Kokopelli's Treasure<br/>
Date Placed: May 11, 2002<br/>
Location:  Florida, Pinellas County <br/>
Nearest Town: Dunedin<br/>
<br/>
KOKOPELLI'S TREASURE<br/>
Welcome!  In order to locate the actual letterbox treasure,  you will be <br/>
required to visit 3 of Pinellas Counties most beautiful parks for clues.  <br/>
These clues when placed in the correct order will yield the final compass <br/>
course required to locate the letterbox.  Each clue is a digit (number), it's <br/>
up to you to put them in the correct order.  They are easy to get to and <br/>
locate.  The entire hunt doesn't have to be completed in one day,    Good <br/>
hunting,  and be sure to enjoy the scenery!  Don't be discouraged... this is <br/>
not a tough as it sounds :)<br/>
<br/>
CLUE # 1<br/>
To retrieve this clue you will first have to go to John Chestnut County Park, <br/>
located on the east side of Lake Tarpon, accessed by East Lake Road in Palm <br/>
Harbor.  Once inside the park, proceed to picnic shelter # 11 and stenciled <br/>
in black on the end of one of the picnic tables you will find a number.  This <br/>
number is your first clue.<br/>
<br/>
CLUE #2<br/>
This clue is located in Anderson County Park, which is just south of Tarpon <br/>
Avenue on the East side of US highway 19, and on the west side of LakeTarpon. <br/>
 Once you enter the park, proceed to picnic shelter #2.  Look around the <br/>
floor of the shelter for a black number.    This is your second clue.<br/>
<br/>
CLUE #3  <br/>
Dunedin's Hammock Park is where you will find your 3rd and final clue.  To <br/>
find this park, travel south on Alternate 19 from Curlew Road.  2/10 of a <br/>
mile Past Michigan Ave. you'll see a sign for Hammock Park take that left and <br/>
follow additional signs to the park entrance.  Once there, look for a path <br/>
under the sign "Hammock Day Camp".  Follow this path to the "youth Guild" <br/>
field which has 3 picnic shelters.  Scattered about this field are small <br/>
concrete pillars, each with a number on it.  The number you need is marked by <br/>
2 black dots at the base of the pillar.   This is your third clue <br/>
<br/>
FINDING KOKOPELLI'S TREASURE:<br/>
Now that you have found clues #1, 2 and 3 you are ready to find  Kokopelli's <br/>
Treasure.  Take the numbers you found at locations 1, 2 and 3, and if you put <br/>
them in the right sequence they will point to what you seek.  Proceed to <br/>
Honeymoon Island State Park, at the end of the Dunedin Causeway.  Enter the <br/>
Park ($2.00 fee for one and $4.00 for a car full). Follow the road to a sign <br/>
which reads "picnic area and nature trail".  Park your car and begin walking <br/>
down the Osprey trail, until it meets with the Pelican trail.  Take the <br/>
latter and look for a park bench with the inscription "In Memory of Peg &amp; <br/>
Bill Schwark".    Using your compass, plot a course with the numbers your <br/>
recovered in clues 1,2 and 3.  Only the correct jumble of these 3 numbers <br/>
will point to a "mostly" dead tree.  You will find the letterbox hidden under <br/>
some small dead branches under this tree.  Be sure to bring bug spray and <br/>
water.  All trails are well marked. Enjoy the scenery and be sure to cover <br/>
the letterbox up as well as possible as there are many people who visit this <br/>
site. Happy hunting... KOKOPELLI<br/>
