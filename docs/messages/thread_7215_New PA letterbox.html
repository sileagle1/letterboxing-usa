If you can get those Wilkes Barre boxes planted soon, I know I'll be in the<br/>
area mid September to find them!!!<br/>

&gt;&gt; While visiting relatives in Pennsylvania this weekend we were disappointed<br/>
&gt;&gt; to find that there were no Letterboxes in their immediate area.  I pulled<br/>
&gt;&gt; out my carving tools and got to work.  We planted this one in the pouring<br/>
&gt;&gt; rain Saturday morning.  We hope you enjoy it.   We will be back in<br/>
&gt;&gt; Pennsylvania the end of next month and hope to plant several more,<br/>
&gt;&gt; probably in Wayne county since there are none there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually, I carved a stamp for Promised Land at the end of last week and<br/>
&gt; will be looking to place it soon, perhaps this week, along with several<br/>
&gt; other stamps for the Pike/Monroe/Wayne County areas. I also helped place a<br/>
&gt; box last week in NY state just above the NE PA border (clue coming soon)<br/>
&gt; and have a couple of stamps ready to place in the Scranton/Wilkes Barre<br/>
&gt; area, too. There will soon be plenty more in the Pocono and Endless Mountains!<br/>
