4 and had a great time! In attendance were the Itchy Butt Girls,<br/>
boxitup, Ladybug, and Susan of the Bobcat Crew, who joined us from<br/>
Fredericksburg after having boxed all day in the area!<br/>
<br/>
We're very excited about doing a series in our area around the board<br/>
game Clue, and we hope you'll contribute. Here's the game plan (pun<br/>
intended!):<br/>
<br/>
The stamps will be divided into the three categories in the game:<br/>
people, rooms, and weapons. All weapons stamps will be planted at one<br/>
park, all people stamps at another park, and so on. The three parks<br/>
are in different areas of metro Richmond. The boxes will be planted in<br/>
a circuit of sorts within each park so that out-of-town boxers won't<br/>
have a lot of trouble figuring out how to arrive at each box.<br/>
(Actually, that will probably help Richmonders, too!) For example, the<br/>
clues for box 2 would say something like, "From box 1, walk . . .,"<br/>
and the clues for box 3 would say, "From box 2, walk . . .," and so<br/>
on. We'll be organizing a Hiding Day or Days so that all the stamps<br/>
of, say, rooms can be planted at their park simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
For this series, 23 stamps will have to be carved. Each carver will<br/>
need to provide a logbook and a weatherproof container for each stamp<br/>
that he/she carves. The types of logbooks and containers are entirely<br/>
up to you, as is what you want to carve once you've chosen your item.<br/>
We'd love to see out-of-town boxers on Hiding Day, but if that's not<br/>
possible, we can make arrangements to get your contribution in the<br/>
mail or something like that and plant it on your behalf. We have<br/>
tentatively planned on planting in March.<br/>
<br/>
In order to sign up, go to the Polls section of our Group and choose.<br/>
The following items have already been chosen by the following boxers:<br/>
<br/>
Miss Scarlet = mlgainey<br/>
Mrs. Peacock = Ladybug<br/>
Col. Mustard and the candlestick = Susan of the Bobcat Crew<br/>
The revolver and the conservatory = boxitup<br/>
The knife and the library = The Itchy Butt Girls<br/>
<br/>
The poll closes on Monday, January 20. More details on who got what as<br/>
well as when planting will occur will follow after January 20.<br/>
<br/>
The three parks are: for weapons, Dorey Park in Henrico County; for<br/>
rooms, Poor Farm Park in Hanover County; and for people, Powhite Park<br/>
in the City of Richmond.<br/>
<br/>
