Box #6: A "Mooving" Tale<br/>

<br/>
E. (it pains me to say her full name) rose to fame at the 1939 <br/>
New York World's Fair. By the time the fair closed in 1940, E. had <br/>
become its biggest star.<br/>
<br/>
But, her career was cut short in 1941 when, on her way to an <br/>
appearance in New York City, her custom 18-wheeler was struck <br/>
from behind. She was rushed back to her pastoral home, but <br/>
alas, her injuries proved to be fatal. She had chewed her last <br/>
cud.<br/>
<br/>
Poor, poor E. She was laid to rest in a beautiful field, near the <br/>
water's edge. Though her gravesite remains to this day, the <br/>
verdant fields of her youth have succumbed to modern times.<br/>
