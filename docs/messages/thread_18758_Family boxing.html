It works a lot better than leaving them at Walmart...I<br/>
can't ever get outside the store without them there<br/>
before they start paging on the overhead!<br/>

thread (which was interesting since it changed names somewhere <br/>
through!) I both agree &amp; disagree with a lot of what was said.  We <br/>
letterbox with a 5 &amp; 2 year old.  My 5-year old is very involved &amp; <br/>
my 2-year old is involved in-so-much has he ooohs &amp; ahhhs &amp; we have <br/>
to hold him very tightly by the arm to make sure he doesn't run off, <br/>
fall off, climb up, etc... while we are stamping &amp; replacing.  I've <br/>
found the most difficult part of all of this is keeping my 5 year <br/>
old quiet when she sees anyone else approaching as she is apt to <br/>
squeal "Mommy HURRRRRRRRRY!!!!! PEOPLE ARE COMING!!!!!" which of <br/>
course doesn't alert ANYONE to the fact that we might be up to <br/>
something does it?  But she's learned to keep it down &amp; be <br/>
more "cool".  Now, when she gets stressed she lets me get speedy &amp; <br/>
tries to distract her brother with Ring Aroung the Rosie which keeps <br/>
him in one place &amp; distracts people from what I'm doing <br/>
(hopefully).  We've found a lot of poorly hidden boxes that we've <br/>
tried to hide better &amp; some that we didn't have enough "material" to <br/>
hide any better- but we try, knowing that the leaves may blow away.  <br/>
My daughter is very concerned with someone finding them that <br/>
shouldn't though, so she is the hiding police &amp; is very careful to <br/>
replace them as they are found- sometimes more than I am ("Mommy, <br/>
put another rock on there").  Don't lose faith in all the kids.  I <br/>
think most are in this for the adventure &amp; it's the wild few that <br/>
are the exception.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Thank you for everyone who expressed their thoughts and concerns<br/>
&gt;   respectfully.  I know you don't know us or how we box, and I do <br/>
think many<br/>
&gt;   of your concerns were fair.  If people don't speak out, we can't <br/>
learn.  I<br/>
&gt;   appreciate those who did not judge *us* individually, based on a <br/>
casual<br/>
&gt;   post.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

Frankly, I don't lose faith in the kids, but in the<br/>
adults who escort them around.  This is not meant to<br/>
be an indictment of all adults who box (or anything<br/>
else) with kids though.  As you point out, it IS the<br/>
few who cause the problems, just as it is the few in<br/>
any group that seem to manage to steal others'<br/>
enjoyment.  I think you make a very good point that we<br/>
all need to keep in mind - ALL kids are not rotten<br/>
boxers.  However, it reminds me that - as a parent, a<br/>
coach, and a scout leader - I need to be diligent with<br/>
the kids I lead to make certain I do my best to help<br/>
them be responsible and respectful.  <br/>

  Yeah, I'm with you Dave!  My husband and I were out boxing several weeks ago and there was a group of "little ones" in front of us on the trail doing the same.    When we got to the box, there were very intricate instructions for a bonus box included.  Being over 50, we had to write all the clues down for fear of forgetting.  After following all the clues, we just couldn't find it.  While we were bush wacking through the brambles, the kids were standing on the bridge watching us at this point and shouted down to us, "Do you want a hint?  It's on the other side of the bridge!"  Well you can believe that my husband was truly mortified.  We had taken a left instead of a right, and he used to be a Forward Observer in the Army!  lol<br/>
