                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received an email from someone who had recently been up to the <br/>
Claddagh Letterbox in Cornwall Bridge, CT. He said that the box was <br/>
in good shape but that someone had left a message in the logbook <br/>
saying they had taken the stamp pad...I'm still shaking my head over <br/>
that one. The reason I am writing is to let anyone who might be <br/>
headed up that way know that there's no stamp pad. It is a long hike<br/>
and would be a major disappointment if you did not bring a pad of <br/>
your own. (I believe most folks do but just in case you were counting <br/>
on ours- it's been abducted) We probably won't get back up there for <br/>
a few months to replace it. <br/>
