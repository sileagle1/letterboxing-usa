C'mon NeveEnuf, please just think of me as a close friend asking you<br/>
to not repeat something I've shared with you. I'm just requesting that<br/>
folks not post any more than I've given in my clue. I have spent<br/>
hundreds of hours creating stamps, hiking trails to find them homes<br/>
and crafting the clues to go with them. I have a very strong sense of<br/>
ownership. They really do belong to me, for goodness sake! I have<br/>
chosen to share them with you and all the rest of my letterboxing<br/>
companions but I still think of them as mine.<br/>
<br/>
I know that the NewAge database has a number of enthusiastic fans. Why<br/>
not let those who like it participate and those who don't opt out?<br/>
Forcing us to be a part of something we don't care for breeds nothing<br/>
but animosity.<br/>
<br/>
I'm on bended knee. Please, remove my Not-So-Magnificent-Seven from<br/>
your database. I don't want them there and no one asked me if they<br/>
could put them there. The folks who put them there have tried to<br/>
remove them. It's in your power to remove them. As a friend, I am<br/>
asking you to exercise that power and honor my request. Funhog<br/>

Just for the record, no members of the NewAge group have asked me to <br/>
remove a box because Funhog doesn't want it there. Other members who <br/>
are anti database have asked me to remove their boxes, but the group <br/>
was originally started for the sole purpose of having a database and <br/>
I won't remove boxes that others have entered. If you don't like the <br/>
database, then don't join the group. <br/>

The ONLY request I received was one (and only one) from Funhog and no <br/>
where did they mention the name of the boxes they wanted removed. <br/>
Even if I wanted to remove them, I couldn't since I don't have the <br/>
names. <br/>
<br/>
IMO, letterboxes are like children. You raise them from infant (idea <br/>
for a box) to teenager (clue writing), then you send them out into <br/>
the world. Once they're gone, you're no longer able to control what <br/>
happens to them. I think that's really what this is all about. People <br/>
want to control every little detail or comment about their boxes, and <br/>
that's just not possible. If you want to control it that much, then <br/>
keep it in your house and only let certain people sign into it (now <br/>
doesn't that sound like fun *rolls eyes*)<br/>
<br/>
If someone is that overprotective of their boxes, then maybe they <br/>
shouldn't be planting them in the first place. <br/>

I almost laughed out loud when compared Funhog to a child not getting <br/>
her way, since I thought the whole New Age board was created for the <br/>
same reason.  You wanted a database so picked up your sticks and <br/>
decided to play with someone else that liked you.  Childish, indeed, <br/>
and hypocritical as far as I can tell.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to continue with the child comparison, though, how about <br/>
this: Boxes always need maintenance.  They never actually grow up!  <br/>
Nope, they're always the kid--maybe a teenager in fact, that likes to <br/>
go off alone and pretend to be independent, but then goes back to mom <br/>
and dad asking for more money.  A box usually isn't thrown into the <br/>
wild to fend for itself for all eternity.  The owner will usually <br/>
drop by once in awhile to replace the logbook, stamp, ziplock bags, <br/>
etc. as needed.  For orphan boxes, some kind soul might drop by and <br/>
do the honors.  So by your own comparison, you shouldn't have a <br/>
database of boxes the owner does not approve of since the box isn't a <br/>
full grown adult--as you seemed to suggest.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If someone is that overprotective of their boxes, then maybe they <br/>
&gt; shouldn't be planting them in the first place. <br/>
<br/>
Attitudes like that will just drive letterboxers underground.  Are <br/>
you trying to help this hobby or destroy it?  Telling someone like <br/>
Funhog that they shouldn't be hiding letterboxes.  Blasphany.  We <br/>
could say the same about you: If you don't like us letterboxers, <br/>
maybe YOU shouldn't be the one involved in this hobby.  I don't <br/>
really believe that myself, but that's an easy conclusion to reach if <br/>
I used your same twisted sense of logic.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, if your sense of logic is so good, let's follow it further.  <br/>
Let's find all of your boxes and replace the stamps with ones that we <br/>
like.  Maybe even move the box a bit.  Why not?  What the owner think <br/>
doesn't matter.  As soon as they release the box out in the wild, <br/>
it's fair game.  You said so yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Funhog has placed some wonderful letterboxes, but she's not going to <br/>
stop placing them because of a couple of misfits.  She'll just make <br/>
sure the clues are going given "under the table" so the select few <br/>
she approves.  It'll drive her letterboxes underground--which is <br/>
criminal for such wonderful boxes.<br/>
<br/>
And then to deny access to the board just because you don't like what <br/>
somebody else has to say?  So they can't provide input?  Talk about <br/>
censorship with a capital C.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I don't care.  I have little doubt it'll last that long.  <br/>
It's too easy to spike the database with false information.  (And <br/>
don't think for a second that I'm the only person who has done <br/>
that.)  The implementation is absolutely awful and is a bear to use--<br/>
especially as the database continues to grow.  It's laughable.  And, <br/>
even if I'm wrong, it'll just send more letterboxers underground <br/>
making it harder to acquire clues--especially for the boxes you'd <br/>
most likely want to get in the first place.  And you'll end up <br/>
pissing off so many people, you'll eventually find that EVERYONE <br/>
that's joined your board will be a "spy".<br/>
<br/>
A lot of letterboxing relies on the honor system.  I'm not talking <br/>
about counting P's and F's, but rather in honoring the wishing of the <br/>
owner of a box.  I *have* moved letterboxes I've found to new <br/>
locations, but only because I felt the owner wouldn't have liked how <br/>
exposed their box was if they saw what it looked like at that time of <br/>
year.  I have even replaced other people's missing boxes, but tried <br/>
to do so in such a way as to honor their intent by recreating the <br/>
original stamp and placing it as close to the original location as <br/>
possible.  A lot of people like to throw around "there are no rules", <br/>
but that's not true.  There ARE rules.  There MUST be rules if this <br/>
hobby is to work and everyone get along.  And one of the most <br/>
important should be to "honor the owner".<br/>

database pertaining to Funhog's boxes. Furthermore, please remove any <br/>
box listing for which the box owner requests it be removed.<br/>

Ya know, maybe you're right. Now I know why so many other people <br/>
leave this group.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<and, <br="">
&gt; even if I'm wrong, it'll just send more letterboxers underground <br/>
&gt; making it harder to acquire clues--especially for the boxes you'd <br/>
&gt; most likely want to get in the first place.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, there isn't one box that I think is more worthy <br/>
of finding than any other box. I haven't seen one stamp that is <br/>
better than another one....just different. And the only exceptional <br/>
carver I've seen is ScoutDogs. <br/>
<br/>
All I want is the ability to be able to check on a box to see what <br/>
trail conditions it has or how long of a hike it is before I set out. <br/>
I don't want to have to wade through a ton of posts to find out, or <br/>
to wait for the placer to get back to me. Sometimes we wake up in the <br/>
morning and decide then and there to go letterboxing. You could say <br/>
that I could find this information on the clues, but some placers <br/>
don't include this in their clues. Also, the placer could be in great <br/>
shape and think a mile hike is "easy", but the person going after the <br/>
box could be in not so great shape and could hurt themselves trying <br/>
for that box. If the placer just says "easy hike", how is the seeker <br/>
supposed to know how long the hike actually is??<br/>
The Ringing Rox box is a perfect example. You have to cross a boulder <br/>
field to get to it. Now some kids might think this is great fun, but <br/>
other kids might not. I know my 3 yr. old didn't find it fun when we <br/>
had to carry her across the rocks because it was more like rock <br/>
climbing than rock jumping to her. If we had known this, we wouldn't <br/>
have tried for that box. But since I entered that information in the <br/>
database, the next person with a small child will know what to expect <br/>
first.<br/>
<br/>
And that is why I love the database. <br/>
<br/>
I think I'll just continue to letterbox but not sign into anyone's <br/>
logbook. I can still collect images in my book. I don't need to leave <br/>
my mark anywhere. Then no one will know if I've visited their box and <br/>
won't have to worry that I'll "ruin" their box by possibly putting it <br/>
in a database. <br/>

Again, who are you to say anything? You have drove more people away than a<br/>
database that no one has to look at if they dont like it, ever could,<br/>
because the only way to get away from you, is to quit the group. You hold a<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As far as this goes we ALL know how you like to make rules, and if everyone<br/>
doesnt comply with YOUR rules, how you like to attack and belittle them.<br/>
Well, Im a big girl Ryan, so bring it on if you feel the need to attack<br/>
someone. Ill not let you criticize someone else just so youll leave me<br/>
alone. I wont stand by the sidelines and watch you batter and bad talk<br/>
someone like a 12 yr old with a bad attitude.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now as far as the database goes, lets say you never knew your box was in<br/>
said database. Would you be able to tell that it was by looking at the box?<br/>
Does it encourage people to go out and destroy it by seeing it listed? If<br/>
you didnt already know it was in there, would it effect you in any way<br/>
shape or form? The answer to this is no. If Funhog should go underground<br/>
with her boxes. Well thats her choice isnt it? It has nothing to do with<br/>
the letterbox itself. The database harmed nothing. She is the one who is<br/>
showing childish behavior. My two year old showed the same logic. If you can<br/>
t do it my way than I dont want to play.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
New Age is a different site.<br/>
<br/>
You do not get to run it, because you did not make it.<br/>
<br/>
It hurts no one.<br/>

Database/Removal/Letterboxing topics to slams on specific people, <br/>
character and attitude I consider that personal attacks.  Lets back <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Just for the record, there isn't one box that I think is more<br/>
&gt; worthy of finding than any other box. I haven't seen one stamp that<br/>
&gt; is better than another one....just different. And the only<br/>
&gt; exceptional carver I've seen is ScoutDogs.<br/>
<br/>
You know, it's hilarious you can contradict yourself in the same <br/>
paragraph.  No stamp you've seen is better than any others, but <br/>
ScoutDogs is an exeptional carver.  Seems strange that <br/>
an "exceptional" carver is making stamps as unworthy as the rest of <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
Then you continue on about not wanting to find a certain letterbox <br/>
because it required passing a boulder field.  Sounds suspiciously <br/>
like that box was less 'worthy' to find than the boxes that didn't <br/>
require passing a bolder field.<br/>
<br/>
You deny that one box or stamp is more worthy than another, and yet <br/>
you still pick favorites out.  Now I'll be the first to say that <br/>
different boxes hold a different appeal to different people--in fact, <br/>
I've even encouraged people to mentally note such things and design <br/>
the box with exactly that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; All I want is the ability to be able to check on a box to see what <br/>
&gt; trail conditions it has or how long of a hike it is before I set<br/>
&gt; out. I don't want to have to wade through a ton of posts to find<br/>
&gt; out, or to wait for the placer to get back to me.<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing wrong with that.  But why antagonize others in the <br/>
process?  Encourage people to add their boxes to the database and <br/>
they'd be fair game.  Do it behind their backs and it's a recipe for <br/>
disaster.  There's nothing wrong with the database--it's the lack of <br/>
control for the owners that's the problem.  Give it to them.  It <br/>
won't hurt you none, and everyone will be happier.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You could say that I could find this information on the clues, but<br/>
&gt; some placers don't include this in their clues.<br/>
<br/>
If the clue maker doesn't provide enough information for you to make <br/>
an informed decision about whether to get the box or not, then maybe <br/>
the box isn't meant for you.  Just don't get it.  Don't try to force <br/>
a box not designed with you in mind to fit your needs.  Let it go.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If the placer just says "easy hike", how is the seeker <br/>
&gt; supposed to know how long the hike actually is??<br/>
<br/>
You could try looking it up on the Internet.  You could search hiking <br/>
guides.  You could ask others who've found the box.  And you could e-<br/>
mail the owner of the box and ask if they'd be willing to add such <br/>
information to their clue.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I know my 3 yr. old didn't find it fun when we <br/>
&gt; had to carry her across the rocks because it was more like rock <br/>
&gt; climbing than rock jumping to her. If we had known this, we<br/>
&gt; wouldn't have tried for that box.<br/>
<br/>
But you DID try for that box!  You walked up to a boulder field and <br/>
deliberately decided that you'd rather continue forward and get the <br/>
letterbox than to turn back.  You could have aborted your mission <br/>
before stepping one foot on that bolder field.  But you didn't.  <br/>
Why?  Because getting that box was more important than the well-being <br/>
of your child?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, before the flames start, I'm surely exaggerating.  When you go <br/>
out on a mission, it's sometimes tough to abort halfway through.  I'm <br/>
guilty of that myself and am willing to conceed it can happen to the <br/>
best of us.<br/>
<br/>
Rather, I'd like to remind people to use a little common sense out on <br/>
the trails.  Don't endanger yourself or others when you head out <br/>
there.  If the box is on the edge of a slippery cliff, just there, <br/>
barely out of reach, let it go.  It's not worth it.  If someone hides <br/>
a letterbox at the top of a bridge that requires climbing gear and a <br/>
parachute to get it--and possibily some time in jail--don't do it.  <br/>
It's not worth it.  Is the box hidden in a decomposing stump but <br/>
doesn't appear to be there?  Maybe it fell down into that big, deep <br/>
hole in the center and tearing up the stump will get it.  Don't do <br/>
it.  Let the box go.  It's not worth the damage to the envionment.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But since I entered that information in the <br/>
&gt; database, the next person with a small child will know what to<br/>
&gt; expect first.<br/>
<br/>
You know, a lot of people on this board have children and want <br/>
children-accessible letterboxes.  Why don't a few people create <br/>
letterboxes explicitly with children in mind?  I don't have any <br/>
children and never had any desire to created such boxes myself, but <br/>
it's SOOO necessary with an activity like this!  I want people to <br/>
create boxes and say right there at the very top: This box/series was <br/>
deliberately placed with children of such-and-such years in mind.  <br/>
The stamps would be of Disney and Pixar characters (or any other <br/>
similarly themed characters for younger people).  The clue would be <br/>
educational--teach the children what different types of trees look <br/>
like.  Don't just say look for a maple tree on the right, but include <br/>
a diagram with a picture of a maple leaf!  (This could help adults <br/>
learn the local trees/bushes/flowers/etc as well!)  And they'd all be <br/>
hidden in an easy-to-walk park (preferably one with a playground).   <br/>
The boxes would be hidden low to the ground where the children can <br/>
easily reach.  The logbooks would be large since kids tend to scrawl <br/>
rather large letters with their unpracticed hands and need the extra <br/>
room.  The logbook would be decorated with stickers too, with lots of <br/>
cartoon characters on the cover.<br/>
<br/>
In all honestly, I've never seen one, single letterbox that I would <br/>
call "kid friendly".  Some are better candidates than others, I'll <br/>
grant you that, but I've never seen anybody hide a letterbox <br/>
deliberately with kids in mind.  At best, they've always been <br/>
for "parents with kids", with the kids as an afterthought.  <br/>
<br/>
But I've gone out totally on a tangent.  You love the database <br/>
because it helps you decide what boxes to find, but what good is it <br/>
if much of the information in it is wrong because you've managed to <br/>
piss everyone off with it?  A database in and of itself isn't a bad <br/>
idea (although I'm sure some would disagree with me), but the lack of <br/>
owner control or permission is a problem.  And until you've fixed <br/>
that problem, I'd consider anything I saw in the database suspect.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think I'll just continue to letterbox but not sign into anyone's <br/>
&gt; logbook. <br/>
<br/>
Why?  Nobody cares if you sign their logbook.  It's the database they <br/>
don't like!<br/>

<br/>
When was "unworthy" used?  The point here was to say that all<br/>
boxes <br/>
are worth finding and all stamps are worth collecting and as an added <br/>
bonus, she thinks ScoutDogs is an exceptional carver.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It has nothing to do with being `worthy' and everything to do<br/>
with <br/>
the ability of the boxer.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;You deny that one box or stamp is more worthy than another, and yet<br/>
&gt;you still pick favorites out. <br/>
<br/>
Who picked a favorite?  Again, it's about the ability of the<br/>
boxers.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Do it behind their backs and it's a recipe for disaster. <br/>
<br/>
Nothing was done behind anyone's back.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;There's nothing wrong with the database--it's the lack of control <br/>
&gt;for the owners that's the problem. <br/>
<br/>
Do you mean the kind of control that lets anyone edit entries to say <br/>
things like, This is a bad idea?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;You could try looking it up on the Internet. You could search hiking<br/>
&gt;guides. <br/>
<br/>
You can't determine how long a trail is, on the Internet, based<br/>
on <br/>
letterbox clues and I'm sure most people don't have hiking<br/>
guides for <br/>
every park and trail in the US.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;You could ask others who've found the box. <br/>
<br/>
Don't know that, haven't found the box yet.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;And you could e-mail the owner of the box and ask if they'd be <br/>
&gt;willing to add such information to their clue.<br/>
<br/>
That would be great if everyone was online 24/7, thus one of the <br/>
reasons for the database.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;the trails. Don't endanger yourself or others when you head out<br/>

<br/>
Exactly!!  That's another reason for the database, one tool to <br/>
minimize searching of posts and other media to help make an informed <br/>
decision about whether or not to travel 2 hours in one direction for <br/>
a box or boxes.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;You love the database because it helps you decide what boxes to <br/>
&gt;find, but what good is it if much of the information in it is wrong <br/>
&gt;because you've managed to piss everyone off with it? <br/>
<br/>
I would venture to say that most (I can't say all, because people <br/>
aren't perfect.) of the information is accurate and does not give <br/>
away information about a box that isn't already in the clues, but <br/>
does give information about conditions of the trail.  You might want <br/>
to watch your language here.  Several people have expressed a concern <br/>
for that type of language.<br/>
