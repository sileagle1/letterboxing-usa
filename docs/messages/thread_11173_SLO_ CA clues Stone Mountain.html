Siberian Dwarf Hamsters on Stone Mountain<br/>
<br/>
San Luis Obispo, SLO County, CA<br/>
<br/>
placed 3-10-03<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Siberian Dwarf Hamster letterboxes are dedicated to two furry <br/>
friends, Pikel and Joe (Mama) Louis. Although no longer with me, <br/>
hope would have them roaming free and busily hoarding on the stone <br/>
mountain behind my house in San Luis Obispo. This particular rocky <br/>
mountain is unique in its treeless barren environment and it's great <br/>
view of both north and south San Luis Obispo. It is also home to the <br/>
Rock Wren, a bird I haven't seen on the other peaks, a captivating <br/>
bird with its smoke gray color and shy habits. <br/>
<br/>

Directions to trail head<br/>
<br/>
by car: Headed North on 101, take the Madonna Rd. exit, turn right <br/>
onto Madonna Rd., turn left on to Higuera, an immediate right on to <br/>
SOUTH st.. From here you can stop at the donut shop or continue two <br/>
blocks on South St. to Exposition, make a right. The trail head is <br/>
after the houses on the right hand side and is marked the South <br/>
Hills Open Space.<br/>
<br/>
walking from meadow park. For an additional walk or to take the <br/>
scenic route you can start at Meadow park, (Meadow lane and South <br/>
street) and walk the paths west to Exposition and then left to the <br/>
trail head.<br/>
<br/>
Biking gives you some extra options. You can ride the bike paths in <br/>
meadow park or if you are coming from South Higuera turn right on <br/>
Bridge St. and continue on bike path to Exposition, turn right and <br/>
you are there.<br/>
<br/>
Both LB's are approximately  mile up the south hills trail.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the main trail uphill, past the fence and the wooden gate, <br/>
until you reach a fork with a trail marker, follow the arrow to the <br/>
left. Continue on the trail up the hill to the ridge. If you lose <br/>
the trail for a second don't worry, it will become clear as long as <br/>
you continue up. Watch where you step because the rocks can trip you <br/>
up. You will continue up the trail and will reach three significant <br/>
rocky tops that level out some and have larger boulders to <br/>
distinguish them. Each one will appear to be the top but another <br/>
will be in the distance once you reach one. Finally the last rocky <br/>
top will only reveal a round topped hill in the immediate distance <br/>
with no large rocks at top. If you continue on the trail you will <br/>
reach a fork, one leading up another down to the end of the trail. <br/>
If you get there you will have gone too far. Back track to the last <br/>
nearest rock top. <br/>
<br/>
When you reach the final and highest rocky top you will look for a <br/>
place on the trail where a boulder on the right and a boulder on the <br/>
left leave you only a foot and  space to walk through. The boulder <br/>
on the left is 2 feet high, 3 feet long, and has the surface of a <br/>
bees nest with holes and stripes. The boulder on the right is 5 <br/>
times as big, and comes up nearly 5 feet. Stand between the two <br/>
rocks and walk 5 paces farther down the trail to a chair shaped <br/>
rock. This is a perfect place to rest and sit and from there you are <br/>
very close to the letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
SDH1: Mama<br/>
<br/>
Stand on the rock facing the round hill. 6 feet below you and on the <br/>
right you will see a small ravine, 25 feet long. Carefully enter and <br/>
look in a crevice behind the largest sage smelling tree, behind a <br/>
rock in the crevice will be the letter box.<br/>
<br/>
SDH2 : Pikel<br/>
<br/>
Stand on the rock and face San Luis Mountain. Find the pink, orange <br/>
large building at its base and walk 27 paces in that direction down <br/>
hill (Be carefull! It is somewhat steep).<br/>
<br/>
You should find yourself in a small grassy area (big enough for <br/>
standing room for one person) with a 8 foot rocky wall on your left <br/>
hand shoulder, behind you on the ground two rocks that appear as one <br/>
will reveal the letter box.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letter boxing!<br/>
