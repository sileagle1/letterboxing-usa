                    <html><body><p>Hello, I would just like to let those looking for the Jockey Hollow letter box and especially floating feather (since I have no other way to reach him/her) that I found the JOckey Hollow box somewhat scattered at the site. The box itself had a couple inches of rainwater in it and was empty about ten feet from the site. The logbook was a little ways away. Though quite wet, it was still readable and could be saved with some drying out. I found only pieces of the stamp remaining, near another tree. I dried out everything as much as possible and rehid the box. So its still there, just in a bad condition. I hope floating feather sees this and can replace the box because the clues were absolutely wonderful, it was a great hike.</p>
