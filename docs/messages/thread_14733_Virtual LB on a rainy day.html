It's been a rainy day here too, so my oldest (12) and I have both <br/>
found a virtual box. We found the Emerald City. :)<br/>
Can you post a link to the site (or sites) where you got your clues? <br/>
I'm looking for more virtual boxes to find during the day. I work <br/>
evenings and my partner works days, so our only hunting time is on <br/>
Wed. and Saturday when we're both off. I can't go that long <br/>
without 'boxing! *gasp*  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, and happy hunting!<br/>
