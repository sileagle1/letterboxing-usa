                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow are we on the same vibes or what? I have been think the same thing about hiding boxes at reststops and overlooks. Overlooks might be easier. Often rest stops and information centers have places you can walk your dogs that lead out into the woods, so I think those places might be good for hiding boxes. You just have to be careful where you step.<br/>
<br/>
For boxes I have been using those cheap glad boxes with a zip lock bag inside. I try to place a rock on them so they don't get washed away. They seem to stay dry. <br/>
<br/>
What do you guys use for books? I have been making some but that is time consuming. Does it matter is the paper has rules in it? Mine don't but like I said I am looking for an easier and cheap way so I thought those 79 cent notebooks might work. What do ya'll think?<br/>

<br/>
I was wondering how those containers worked.  I was thinking of using<br/>
them for some short term boxes.  I guess with enough ziplocks inside, it<br/>
doesn't really matter much!<br/>

I go for whatever is cheap.  The nice little plain sketchbooks are<br/>
regularly $2.50 and more at Michael's.  That pretty much doubles the<br/>
cost of a box.  I have used the lined memo pads even though the lines<br/>
are unsightly &amp; the paper isn't very good for impressions.  They do<br/>
work!!<br/>
