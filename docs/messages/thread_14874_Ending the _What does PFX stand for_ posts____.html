Instead of everyone responding though these posts, why don't we set up this mailing list like other that I am on and have a weekly or monthly or whatever timeframe auto message put out with a few major FAQ's on it, such as what those silly numbers after everyone's signatures means, etc, etc, etc.  We could also have it in the welcome letter, however, it's been my experience that most don't even read those letters in full. That's what we do elsewhere.<br/>
