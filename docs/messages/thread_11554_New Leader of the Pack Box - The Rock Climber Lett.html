The Rock Climber Letterbox<br/>

WARNING: Cliff area hold kids hands and leash dogs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Getting There: Rte 195 in Mansfield to the Historical Society in the old<br/>
Town Hall building  park in rear and enter the blue trail. Follow clues to<br/>
these other great boxes, Bed Rugg<br/>
<http: bedrug.htm="" ma="" www.letterboxing.org=""> , Inherit the Earth<br/>
<http: inherit.htm="" ma="" www.letterboxing.org="">  and Vermont Quarter<br/>
<http: ma="" vtstamp.htm="" www.letterboxing.org=""> . Plane Spotter<br/>
<http: ma="" planespt.htm="" www.letterboxing.org="">  is back near the building.<br/>
The trail wanders  down through the woods after the bridge it turns right to<br/>
go out to the fifty foot cliff and beautiful view. Like other boxes in the<br/>
area you should do the same. Enjoy the view but keep the kids safe! Now to<br/>
find the rock climber ..<br/>
<br/>
     The rock climber had come out the trail on a sunny spring day to<br/>
practice his technique. Over his shoulder were the coils of ropes  and<br/>
around his waist a variety of Bolle clips were fastened. He carried a small<br/>
pack with his gloves and picks and other tools of the sport. His water<br/>
bottle swung freely on a strap and  a small book on rock climbing sites was<br/>
stuffed into the pocket of his brown  climbing pants. The swish of  his<br/>
pants the only sound on the trail that day as he hiked.  When he passed the<br/>
cliff, he was startled by the passing of a large flock of turkeys trotting<br/>
along.  After their chance meeting he continued on soon realizing he had<br/>
dropped his book. He went back to the trail to look and began at the<br/>
overlook.<br/>
<br/>
     From the view continue on the trail that leads down and around the<br/>
cliff . At the first double blue  stop. While facing the double blue take a<br/>
reading of 20 degrees. That is where the Rock Climber dropped a piece of his<br/>
equipment. Be sure to replace it well hidden as this is a busy trail for<br/>
rock climbers and others alike.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
