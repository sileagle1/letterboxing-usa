                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi John.  I wonder if kids would like "earning" patches?  I was in Camp<br/>
Fire Girls as a kid and loved doing the activities needed to earn the<br/>
various colored beads and patches.  This sounds similar.<br/>
<br/>
But nowadays, as an adult, I can't say that earning patches means much to<br/>
me!  For me, getting the stamp images in my little notebook is reward<br/>
enough, not to mention the joy of hiking and visiting a new place.<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to hearing from everybody else on this topic!  How do<br/>
you envision it working? Would it be on the honor system?  Or would<br/>
somebody have to count your 100 or 150 or 200 collected stamp impressions<br/>
to verify that you qualify for a patch?<br/>

Even as an adult I still love collecting patches.  I sew them onto<br/>
backpacks, etc...  Even a decal would be nice to put on my fiance's car,<br/>
since I cannot afford to have one yet - (Ah Graduate school stipends...)<br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was a boy scout and collecting beautiful patches made<br/>
all of those camp-outs in the rain even more enjoyable...  I am sure kids<br/>
would still enjoy collecting them.  And it would teach them how to<br/>
sew.  If they like collecting stamps, I am sure they would like to collect<br/>
patches.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that until this hobby leads to a headquarters (could<br/>
happen - It did with the AT) that this be an informal recognition<br/>
(submit the letterbox name/date of acquisition) similar to the 4000<br/>
footers club in New England.<br/>
<br/>
Patches (the last time I checked) were only a few bucks apiece (however<br/>
there is a minimum amount of number you need to order.)  Then you can<br/>
place quantities F10, F25, F50, F100, P10, X200, etc on the circumference <br/>
of the round main LbNA member patch, to cut costs until this takes off.<br/>
<br/>
Even hold a patch making contest to find the best design. I am sure<br/>
there will be many artistic entries here. <br/>
<br/>
The best part is that it increases awareness of this activity.  Currently<br/>
it is through word of mouth, and accidently finding a box.  But member<br/>
patches/decals would add to the hype.<br/>

I LOVE the idea of a member patch too.  it certainly would be a great place to start. I think you made some excellent points, BUT some of us like a more "concrete" goal, although I do not want to lose sight of the stamp as an outstanding reward unto itself.  Frankly, for my kids (7&amp;9) it has been more than enough to keep them going on hikes they might otherwise peter out on.<br/>

  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So ... we would have just a general patch "Letterboxing Patch" <br/>
then   a count found patch  ... 10, 20, 50 etc<br/>
then  a count planted patch<br/>
then a patch for "stamp carving"<br/>
and a patch for "clue writing"<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a great idea to me...<br/>

logos:<br/>
<br/>
The major cost is in the "digitizing" of the design.  The embroidery<br/>
people don't care so much about quantity of colors as they do quantity<br/>
of stitches.  A 2"X2" logo is going to run me neary $150 just for the<br/>
digitizing.  After that, it is pretty dang inexpensive.  If you can find<br/>
a little mom &amp; pop stitchery they will let you do the patches in onesy<br/>
twoseys.  Wearing the patch on a jacket or shirt or knapsack would be<br/>
recognizable... but only when you happened to be wearing those<br/>
particular items.<br/>
<br/>
In regards to window stickers.  I have some experience with these as<br/>
well.  They would be cheaper to produce and would be recognizable in the<br/>
parking lots and freeways of the world..... but is that where we want to<br/>
be recognized?<br/>

Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
It has been a long time since I weighed in on any topics, but this one seems<br/>
to speak to me.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Thom on the sticker...I don't paricularly like that idea.<br/>
<br/>
The patches sound like fun, but as soon as it turns into judging each others<br/>
art, that is art of writing, art of carving, art of hiding, etc., well I<br/>
think that opens the door for hard feelings.  A patch that says, I love to<br/>
carve rubber stamps for letterboxes, or I'm a creative clue writer.  These<br/>
we could sew on our back-packs, hats and jackets and be recognized without<br/>
the judging.<br/>
<br/>
Of course finding or planting a quantity of boxes is strickly quantitative<br/>
and really straight forward and not likely to create hard feeling.  A patch<br/>
to say I'm a Letterboxer would be fun too.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also assuming that when we apply to receive a patch we would pay for it<br/>
which gives someone an opportunity to make a little dough (OK a very little<br/>
dough).  This would be a good thing for those very giving individuals that<br/>
are paying for the space for the site, and donating their time for keeping<br/>
us all organized.<br/>

&gt; I'm looking forward to hearing from everybody else on this topic!  How do<br/>
&gt; you envision it working? Would it be on the honor system?  Or would<br/>
&gt; somebody have to count your 100 or 150 or 200 collected stamp impressions<br/>
&gt; to verify that you qualify for a patch?<br/>
<br/>
I think if you thru hike the AT or bag all the high points, its on the honor<br/>
system -- seems good enough for me.  Besides, who would care if someone cheated<br/>
and got themselves a patch to put in their trinket collection -- they <br/>
certainly would be excluding themselves from the social stamp book exchange<br/>
at the pub :-) (it is interesting to point out that Valley Quest _does_<br/>
require sending in the stamp book for their patch, and it took six weeks,<br/>
meaning that if I didn't know this beforehand and didn't keep two stamp <br/>
books at the time and stamp each one, I would be out of luck (and out of the<br/>
field) for six weeks whilst my book was being "verified".)  Besides, how <br/>
could any one person verify the stamps in someone else's book anyway?<br/>
<br/>
As for some of the other thoughts in this thread:<br/>
<br/>
I think the big argument for the patch is the Dartmoor tradition.  Not that<br/>
we have to follow everything Dartmoor (and we obviously haven't), this is <br/>
one thing that feels natural to follow.  It also seems cool to potentially <br/>
collect an LbNA patch _and_ Dartmoor patch (USOF and other orgs also give <br/>
patches for various achievements; I think people like to earn patches in<br/>
general).<br/>
<br/>
As for membership vs achievement patches, there certainly seems to be no<br/>
philosophical reason not to have both.  Some people find achievement patches<br/>
add cachet, some people find they detract.  Prolly can't please everyone.<br/>

realistically, it will be a looooong time before I hit the 100 box<br/>

<br/>
Now, just to make it interesting.. what about a membership patch &amp; then<br/>
5, 10, 50, 100 box PINS...  maybe a cloisonne or something?   I have<br/>
designed a bunch of different kinds of pins &amp; they are universally well<br/>

plated pin.  300 of them are costing us about $750 ($2.50 per pin).  <br/>

administer this sack of pins and bag of patches???<br/>

&gt;Randy raises some good points...  I'm leaning toward a patch or hat<br/>
&gt;(actually, both are possible without much extra expense). but I think<br/>
&gt;realistically, it will be a looooong time before I hit the 100 box<br/>
&gt;mark.  I'm voting for a membership patch for a couple of reasons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, just to make it interesting.. what about a membership patch &amp; then<br/>
&gt;5, 10, 50, 100 box PINS...  maybe a cloisonne or something?   I have<br/>
&gt;designed a bunch of different kinds of pins &amp; they are universally well<br/>
&gt;received (and collected).  We just printed a simple die-cut nickel<br/>
&gt;plated pin.  300 of them are costing us about $750 ($2.50 per pin).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;..and then on to the ugly money part....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As I said before, digitizing a patch is not going to be especially<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like a lot of people would like to see a "membership" patch (could easily be sown on a hat in the early days).  As to milestones, I like the idea of the pins, but patches are a little more visible and probably less prone to loss.  They may be more artistically satisfying...<br/>
<br/>
Assuming most of the digitizing has been taken care of in an LbNA membership patch, can someone offer some insight on the cost differential between pins and the incremental cost of a milestone patch (which may include a lot of the art from the membership patch).<br/>
<br/>
One of the issues this whole thing brings up is the possible migration to becoming  like a club or organization which may or may not be where we want to go.  Certainly one way to deal with the finances and fullfilment issues would be to develop some sort of membership (I'm thinking less than $5 here, and maybe it's just a one-time thing), and you would get the patch as part of the membership.  Ofc ourse, membership would in NO way be required to participate in the hobby, the list, nor to have access to the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I'm looking forward to hearing from everybody else on this topic!  How do<br/>
&gt; you envision it working? Would it be on the honor system?  Or would<br/>
&gt; somebody have to count your 100 or 150 or 200 collected stamp impressions<br/>
&gt; to verify that you qualify for a patch?<br/>
<br/>
I think if you thru hike the AT or bag all the high points, its on the honor<br/>
system -- seems good enough for me.  Besides, who would care if someone cheated<br/>
and got themselves a patch to put in their trinket collection -- they <br/>
certainly would be excluding themselves from the social stamp book exchange<br/>
at the pub :-) (it is interesting to point out that Valley Quest _does_<br/>
require sending in the stamp book for their patch, and it took six weeks,<br/>
meaning that if I didn't know this beforehand and didn't keep two stamp <br/>
books at the time and stamp each one, I would be out of luck (and out of the<br/>
field) for six weeks whilst my book was being "verified".)  Besides, how <br/>
could any one person verify the stamps in someone else's book anyway?<br/>
<br/>
As for some of the other thoughts in this thread:<br/>
<br/>
I think the big argument for the patch is the Dartmoor tradition.  Not that<br/>
we have to follow everything Dartmoor (and we obviously haven't), this is <br/>
one thing that feels natural to follow.  It also seems cool to potentially <br/>
collect an LbNA patch _and_ Dartmoor patch (USOF and other orgs also give <br/>
patches for various achievements; I think people like to earn patches in<br/>
general).<br/>
<br/>
As for membership vs achievement patches, there certainly seems to be no<br/>
philosophical reason not to have both.  Some people find achievement patches<br/>
add cachet, some people find they detract.  Prolly can't please everyone.<br/>

as to #3, I can't take it on all by myself, but I feel like I can contribute some time and coordinating effort, once the list gets to some sort of concensus.

Thom and all:<br/>
There seems to be a concensus that, at least, a member or "club" patch<br/>
is a place to start.  Other ideas are all good - let's, however, get the<br/>
first thing acomplished first.<br/>
<br/>
1) Design: - I'm OK with Mitch's LBNA logo, altho I understand that<br/>
other creative solutions may be in the offing.  I also remember some<br/>
hurt feelings from an earlier graphic design adventure - lets make sure<br/>
THAT isns't repeated. <br/>
<br/>
2) Thom - is the digitizing aspect something more than plopping the<br/>
paper image ona good scanner and creating (say) a gif. file? <br/>
<br/>
3) Is there anyone out there with the skills/energy to take this on?<br/>
I'll follow this post with hopefully, the firat of many committments of<br/>
purchase, so wwe can get a sense of the viability of this.<br/>

<br/>
I agree.  Although the LBNA logo is very nice, I think we need the word <br/>
letterboxing on the patch.  I like the idea of a basic "membership" patch to <br/>
begin with, which could be worn on a hat, jacket, whatever you like!  Purchase a <br/>
dozen and sew them on all your T-shirts, hats, and accessories!  <br/>
<br/>
However, I am not sure having actual membership is the way to go at this point.  <br/>
I must say I like the fact that our hobby is loosely organized.  Not sure I would <br/>
support a formal organization like AMC, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't know about hurt feelings back when we developed the LBNA logo. Must have <br/>
missed that!  But we have some wonderful stamp carvers; maybe someone would want <br/>
to carve a design for our patch?  Susan Davis is a master!  Everything I have <br/>
seen of hers is awe-inspiring.<br/>

&lt;&lt; m new at this and haven't yet gone in search of a letterbox, but I like <br/>
 the idea of earning patches. I have an idea that you might kick around. Is <br/>
 there a logo for letterboxing if there is break the logo up into sections <br/>
 and then when you earn the different patches you build the logo. You could <br/>
 also have it broken down into reagions of the US. Think about it.<br/>

Have you ever wondered about heaven and what the "entrance requirements" are? <br/>
There are many theories but you can find out for yourself what the Bible <br/>
says.  These are just a few passages that explain God's plan:<br/>
     Acts 2:36-41        Romans 10:17     Matt 10:32-33<br/>
     Romans 10:9-10   Acts 8:34-38        Acts 2:38     Romans 10:14+<br/>
     Matt 28:19-20       Mark 16:16          <br/>
     1John 4:3             Matt 10:32           1 Peter 3:21<br/>
How do you do that? These passages are good examples of how:<br/>
      Acts 2:36-38;   Romans 6:1-5;  Ephesians 2:19;  Acts 16:29-33; Acts <br/>
22:16 !!!!!<br/>
Then: Eph 2:4-5;  2 Cor 5:14-17  &amp; Romans 8:12-14; Eph 4:16<br/>
On that last day you can claim your reward: Romans 8:18; Rev 2:10<br/>

I don't recall any hard feelings the last time around. It will be a<br/>
tough task &amp; with this bunch of creative minds concensus will be tough. <br/>
It will almost be better to commission the design to one individual &amp; we<br/>
all just have to be happy with what that person comes up with.  Bonnie<br/>
suggested Susan &amp; I would second that vote.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) Thom - is the digitizing aspect something more than plopping the<br/>

<br/>
The digitizing process looks at the outline of the design and decides<br/>
location and quantitiy of stitches in the design.  I think they start<br/>
with an eps file.  It is a specialized application.  I don't think the<br/>
process takes much time &amp; the computer does it all.  The program is<br/>
expensive &amp; that is why it costs so much (so I am told).<br/>

<br/>
For a head count - I will be in for at least three; possibly 6 (for the <br/>
neighbor girls).  I can guess that the local teachers will be interested in <br/>
making the patches available to their students and I have no idea how many <br/>
that would include.   I know of at least 4 families involved in letterboxing <br/>
that are not on the email list.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Randy and all:<br/>
&gt;I just got home, and saw that my wife was among  20 or so responses to<br/>
&gt;this proposal. I've only read her's, with which I agree. But, I did<br/>
&gt;think about it on the way into work this A.M. - here are my thoughts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don't mind the "100" patch, or some other series (50? 25?). That would<br/>
&gt;be great, and, gosh knows, those that have put in the effort (and fun)<br/>
&gt;to put out as many (Hmmm - the Drew clan deserve a patch of their own!)<br/>
&gt;perhaps ought to have a patch or two for their efforts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, I'm MUCH MORE interested in a "Club" patch, so to speak, to sew<br/>
&gt;on my pack or hat. And perhaps a window decal - how many times have I<br/>
&gt;driven past the sites of my few boxes, wondering is a 'boxer is out<br/>
&gt;there looking. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My 2 cents (or sense?).<br/>
&gt;Perhaps more later, after I read the mail!<br/>
&gt;Erik<br/>
