point) we the boxers, meaning both the hider AND finders use common sense.<br/>
1) Be respectful and discrete. If you see someone visiting a grave, come<br/>
back another time. 2) Don't saturate the graveyard with boxes. 3) Make sure<br/>
the subject matter of the box is appropriate and not disrespectful.<br/>

Some of my favorite and most memorable finds are boxes I have found in<br/>
cemeteries. I love boxes that are history based and it fascinates me to read<br/>
a piece of history in the clues and then see actual evidence like the person<br/>
grave stone or birthplace.<br/>

We've planted 12 in Western MA, and I know there are<br/>
at least two others in two other cemeteries. Most of<br/>
them are in "closed" cemeteries, but three of my boxes<br/>
are placed in ones that are not yet full. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I've got no problem with this practice.<br/>
Cemeteries, even ones that are still "active", are<br/>
open to the public. They encourage people to come and<br/>
look at the monuments. Even private cemeteries are<br/>
generally left open to the public, for relatives,<br/>
geneological research, etc. So long as we are<br/>
respectful, what's the harm? And don't we all already<br/>
practice this hobby in a respectful fashion? <br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned that they never plant unless they<br/>
get someone's permission first. If I did things that<br/>
way, fully more than half of my boxes wouldn't have<br/>
been placed. The vast majority of them are in places<br/>
where it isn't even clear who to ask, to say nothing<br/>
about whether or not I'd ever hear back even if I did.<br/>
This goes back to the respectful comments above. Plant<br/>
carefully. Stay out of restricted areas. Don't go so<br/>
far off trail that just getting to the box will have a<br/>
negative impact. Don't destroy the woods just to<br/>
plant, or to find. Don't plant in places you know we<br/>
aren't welcome(i.e. national parks). Remove boxes if<br/>
the owner/caretaker asks. Be respectful, and we'll be<br/>
fine.<br/>

...who is half-way through checking on all his boxes,<br/>
and so far so good...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good comments. Personally, we do not have any issue with planting <br/>
boxes in cemeteries provided the 'residents' are respected and the <br/>
area left untouched. Clues should be very descript so that the box <br/>
may be found with minimal impact.  We love to make it a history <br/>
lesson in the process!<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, someone moved our Gorton Family Cemetery letterbox <br/>
here in CT and restacked the wall a little bit. If this happens <br/>
again, we'll pull the box. I'm definately not ok with ripping apart a <br/>
stonewall and restacking it...just move a small stone or two and it <br/>
is easily removed! <br/>
