                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>We broke in a new logbook today, having just filled our first log not too long ago. The first stamp was the Magic Lamp HH, and, no, I'm not going to tell where we put it. Did we plant it on the trail today, or drop it into another of our local boxes? Decisions, decisions.......
<br/>
<br/>Anyway, on to the boxes!
<br/>
<br/>Jeffrey O. Phelps: Not too many visitors yet. Nice place. You know you've been boxing too much when you can just walk around and find the box without even bothering to read the clues! Things just stick out, ya know? :-)
<br/>
<br/>Unlucky Clucky: Nice, easy hike. We found our own way out on different trails. We now understand why so many boxes have suddenly appeared here.
<br/>
<br/>Amazing Race: We did this one after Clucky, so we had to backtrack a little to get it. I remember thinking to myself as we first passed it's hiding place, "Nice place for a box." Â Definitely been doing this too much.......
<br/>
<br/>Holcomb Farm - Bluebird: Nice spot. Bumped into someone leading a group of kids on a little nature walk. She saw our bag and papers in hand, and wished us luck "looking for the boxes". Is this place cool or what?
<br/>
<br/>Holcomb Farm - Four From One: The best part of this one was the hike out. The trail leads down through an open field to the west. As you walk down the hill to the parking area, you have a completely unblocked view of the ridgeline to the west, behind the farm. The view of the foilage from this spot rivals any other I've seen.
