Hmmm - this reminds me of an idea that someone I know mentioned - that <br/>
person wanted to start "AQUABOXING" which would require boxes that could <br/>
only be reached via kayak, canoe, or ship... (not my idea)<br/>
The camera would have to be:<br/>
1) waterproof<br/>
2) small - they're all fairly decent size in relation to a (small) box <br/>
3) super cheap<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I know that it would have to have it's own seperate box and that would limit <br/>
the places where the hitchhiker could be dropped off &gt;<br/>
------------<br/>
I agree - and frankly, the most appealing thing (IMHO) about a camera isn't <br/>
the camera itself, but the nice little plastic containers that house the film. <br/>
<br/>
I think it might be risky (as a hitchhiker idea) but perhaps trying it out first on a <br/>
known spot as a regular box might give you an idea of how it could work -?? <br/>
(just an idea!) <br/>
Also would require much more frequent monitoring than a regular hitchhiker <br/>
and/or box due to film developing. <br/>

<br/>
My first reaction was, "Hey, cool! That's novel!" I've read the responses, and there were some good points made. <br/>
<br/>
What would concern me more than the medium (either people being afraid of their pictures falling into evil hands or someone being "funny" and taking gross pictures) would be putting your return address on a SASE.  Maybe there is another way to do this that doesn't give out any personal info or addresses, not even a local PO box.  How 'bout if you give this option: the last person to take the last picture notifies you via email (hotmail or yahoo, ie.) that the film is ready to be developed.  Then you give that person the option of developing the pics at their cost and sending you digital pics, or leaving the box for another person.  Once you get the digital pics, you can screen them and post them to the Pictures section in Yahoo.  If the person to find the box with just one pic left doesn't want to be bothered with the cost or effort, they should leave it for another "taker." The person who finds it last and takes the last picture has to be a good sport and willing to pay for developing.  They may be able to get another camera to put in its place to keep the box moving. (Sometimes the disposable flash cameras are available for around $3, or there may be a promotion available where a new camera is provided when you pay for development.) <br/>
<br/>
Think about all the pros and cons.  My gut reaction is "Go for it", but hide it well and express the importance of this inside the box for other people to rehide carefully.  Protect yourself and don't put your home address in the box.  I think you have to look at it as an experiment or adventure.  You could very well lose the camera anywhere along the way to environment or theft.  HH are lost all the time, I think. Will you be upset about it if it disappears?  Make sure that the box has a page that points out any possible negative outcomes and let the finder decide, of course, whether to play or let the next person have the opportunity.  If you still want to have the camera mailed back, does the log stay with it or does the last finder leave the old log with a new camera?<br/>

I am not a geocacher, but I do follow some of the caches in my area <br/>
that are near letterboxes.  There are several that have cameras in <br/>
them -- not as one of the goodies, but for finders to take a photo of <br/>
themselves when they visit.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think that Scott includes a camera in his Letterboxing <br/>
Nebraska box when it is sent to various events around the country.<br/>

Or what you could do is use a self-mailer to www.snapfish.com www.ophoto.com<br/>
or someone similar. Have them filled out before hand (they give you little<br/>
address labels with your account #) then when it's mailed it's posted to<br/>
your online account, you can filter out the "bad" ones (and without risk of<br/>
prosecution as there is here in VA for that type of photo) and no one has to<br/>
know your home address!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great idea!  Maybe instead of making it a HH you could<br/>
make it a "snail mail" letterbox like one that is making<br/>
the rounds around the country now.  You could ask for<br/>
interested people to send their addresses to you offline<br/>
to be included on the mail route, with the last person<br/>
on the list being yourself so you get the camera back.<br/>
That way only letterboxers would receive it and hopefully<br/>
you would get it back safely.<br/>

&gt; I'd like to do a hitchhiker called "Candid Camera" that includes <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; only a logbook and stamp, but a disposable camera as well. Each <br/>
person <br/>
&gt; /group who picked up the hitchhiker would be responsible for taking <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; picture of themselves and also of something else having to do with <br/>
&gt; letterboxing (could be scenery, could be a stamp they carved, I <br/>
don't <br/>
&gt; know - this group is creative, so they'd think of something <br/>
&gt; interesting to photograph!) Anyway, I'd include a SASE and when the <br/>
&gt; last picture was taken I'd have it sent back to me. I'd process the <br/>
&gt; photos and post them online, either on a website for everyone to <br/>
see, <br/>
&gt; or on one that is by invitation only (not sure which yet). I know <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; it would have to have it's own seperate box and that would limit <br/>
the <br/>

it <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like a great idea. Lots of geocaches do have cameras inside, so<br/>
despite the warnings others have written, I don't think there's really<br/>
much danger from dampness or vandals, not any more than any other<br/>
letterbox is in danger of getting wet or discovered by disrespectful<br/>
people. Placing anything out in the woods is an act of trust.<br/>
<br/>
There are other projects with cameras going from one person to<br/>
another. Have you seen these?<br/>
http://www.phototag.org/<br/>
http://www.almostcool.org/pt/<br/>
http://www.fury.com/cameo/<br/>
<br/>
You can see some of the photos taken from geocache cameras on the<br/>
geocaching website, but they end up all kind of looking alike, since I<br/>
don't know who the people are! I like your idea of making it a<br/>
hitchhiker instead of a fixed letterbox because it will get a change<br/>
of scenery as well as people. A hitchhiker is a bit of a logbook and a<br/>
bit of a travelogue.<br/>
<br/>
Like any hitchhiker, there is a chance it will get lost or misplaced,<br/>
and all your work will be lost. Before I discovered letterboxing I<br/>
created a number of mail art type projects with return addresses that<br/>
never made it back to me. All the hours I worked on those things!<br/>
Another concern is that it may take so long to get back to you that<br/>
you might change your address before then. But its a great idea, go<br/>
for it.<br/>

I like that idea. I actually use snapfish, but had forgotten that the<br/>
self-mailers just have your code on it and not your address. If I do<br/>
end up doing this type of box that's probably a much safer way to go.<br/>
Nautilus<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Or what you could do is use a self-mailer to www.snapfish.com<br/>
www.ophoto.com<br/>
&gt; or someone similar. Have them filled out before hand (they give you<br/>
little<br/>
&gt; address labels with your account #) then when it's mailed it's posted to<br/>
&gt; your online account,<br/>

This is a great idea! Disposable cameras are inexpensive (I just <br/>
picked one up from Sav-on for $4.99), so losing it to vandalism or <br/>
the weather is not such a big deal.  The idea that someone would take <br/>
pornographic pictures and send them back to you might be a plus; in <br/>
fact, it brings to mind a whole other camera letterbox idea:  "The <br/>
Larry Flynt Camera Letterbox." ;-) Imagine the possibilities.  You <br/>
might limit the exposure of your home address by just asking the <br/>
person who takes the last photo to make a post here announcing <br/>
completion, then you can send that one LBer your address.  Of course, <br/>
anyone could claim they took the last photo and ask for your address, <br/>
but aren't our addresses in the phonebook anyway?  You could write a <br/>
number on the camera and ask that this be included in the post, so <br/>
that you're at least sure the poster actually is a letterboxer who <br/>
found the camera.  The only real problem I see with this idea is <br/>
that, though fairly small, disposable cameras are still too big to <br/>
fit as a hitchhiker into 95% of the letterboxes I've found, so moving <br/>
it along would be a problem.  On the other hand, it's a great idea to <br/>
include one in a local letterbox, then you can check on the LB from <br/>
time to time, and retrieve the camera when the last shot was taken.<br/>
