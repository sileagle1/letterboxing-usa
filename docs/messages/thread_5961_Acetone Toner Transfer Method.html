<br/>
It doesnt work for me.  I dunno, maybe I should try a copy from something <br/>
other then from the big fancy-schmancy copier/printer at work.  ;-)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have tried this method.  The first time it worked like a dream.  The<br/>
second time I just got a smeared mess.  It depends on the copier.  I<br/>
think the older copiers have toner that works better than the newer ones<br/>
and trying to do it from a laserjet printed image was a disaster for me,<br/>
as well.  <br/>
<br/>
The more acetone in the product you're using the better, too, maybe.<br/>
Some nail polish removers have more water than others and perhaps that<br/>
could make it less effective.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if my second and third failures were the result of method<br/>
incompatibilities with the copy or the nail polish remover.  If I were<br/>
to bet on it, though, I think it might be the copy.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It also depends on the surface of the material to which you are <br/>
transfering the design.  The Dick Blick carving material has an <br/>
almost shiny surface and doesn't take a transfer well.  I have good <br/>
luck with the Marscarve and erasers.  In addition, I use a slightly <br/>
thicker paper so that it doesn't stretch and blur the design when I <br/>
blot it with solvent.<br/>
