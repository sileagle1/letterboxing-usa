While checking one of my letterboxes recently I was <br/>
pleasantly surprised to see a visitor from Jakarta,<br/>
Indonesia!  This is by far the longest distance anyone<br/>
has travelled for one of my boxes, and it made me<br/>
wonder what is the longest distance travelled for other<br/>
people's boxes?<br/>

Our farthest visitor was found in one of our VT boxes. They came from New Zealand &amp; Australia and stopped while on vacation in the area. <br/>

Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!! <br/>

I have had a visitor from Dartmoor (England) to a couple of my Seattle<br/>
area letterboxes! I have also had Japanese visitors to my Kubota<br/>
Gardens letterbox, but I think they were there primarily for the<br/>
gardens and not       <br/>
the letterbox.<br/>

My original Kent Trails box (GR, MI) had a visitor from Brazil stamp <br/>
in. This was the first box I ever placed, BTW ... almost exactly one <br/>
year ago. <br/>
<br/>
I knew NOTHING of carving stamps! I used an old eraser I had on hand <br/>
and hacked out the stamp with a kitchen knife after an insomnia-<br/>
induced night of internet surfing when I first discovered <br/>
letterboxing. LOL ... placed this, my first box, the next afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
This box lasted from October to March, was replaced about a month <br/>
later and is still going strong.  Funny thing is, this summer while <br/>
doing a maintenance check, I found the original stamp and logbook <br/>
stuck back into the container with the new box and stamp. Vandals <br/>
remorse? Who knows ... there was no note or explanation.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
