East Rock Park<br/>
New Haven/Hamden<br/>
New Haven County, CT<br/>
Rated Moderate. One steep descent (stairs) and two fairly steep climbs (short).<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions:<br/>
Farnum Drive begins at the base of East Rock in New Haven at the end of Orange Street, and runs northward to Hamden where it turns and begins its steep ascent to the summit.  It can be accessed from Davis Street in Hamden. Davis runs between Whitney Ave. at Hamden Hall Country Day School and Ridge Rd., 2 blocks up from where Ridge starts off State St., Rte. 5, across from the Hamden branch of the DMV.<br/>
The road to the summit is posted as being open only on weekends and holidays between Nov. 1 and April 1. It should be open daily during the warmer months.<br/>
NOTE: There are sign boards with the map of the park adjacent to all parking areas. You may want to sketch some trails, as I have yet see any paper maps to take.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on Farnum Drive as it snakes its way to the summit. There is limited parking right at the summit. Continue on the loop to the larger parking lot just below the monument.<br/>
<br/>
The Hike (1.5 hrs):<br/>
