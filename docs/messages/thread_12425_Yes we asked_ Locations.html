&gt; For those of you who have planted your boxes inside buildings I have a <br/>
&gt; couple of questions....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Did you ask permission?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If so, whom did you ask?  Did you go to the top... ask the owner/manager? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What kinds of "inside" places have been used?  I know about the Great <br/>
&gt; American Stamp Store, but I heard mention of people looking in cabinets.  I <br/>
&gt; saw the name of the box, but what kind of place is it in?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the info,<br/>

Yep ...we've planted three boxes inside buildings and we asked .  one <br/>
location has gone out of business with our box still there  :( .  One owner <br/>
declined .... the possibility of ink stained fingers near her merchandise <br/>
turned her off.   <br/>
<br/>
