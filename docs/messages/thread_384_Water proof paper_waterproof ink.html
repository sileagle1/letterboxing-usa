&gt;Regarding the waterproof paper not accepting water-based stamp pad inks:<br/>
&gt;There are some stamp pads with ink designed for  non-porus surfaces - we<br/>
&gt;have one that we use at our local planning comission to stamp mylars.<br/>
&gt;Tenacious and messy stuff, and, I believe, black only.  I don't know the<br/>
&gt;manufacturer, and won't for a week at least.<br/>
SuperMarking Ink?  Nasty stuff that will stamp on ANYTHING (glossy, glass,<br/>
metal), but requires lots of special treatment...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;However, maybe in the long run  its better to work on methods of keeping<br/>
&gt;the book dry, to thus keep flexibility in book/paper choice, and, choice<br/>
&gt;in ink pad color?<br/>
I think this sounds like a much better option.<br/>
<br/>
My two cents,<br/>

<br/>
BUT- if interested, contact an engineering supply place (the kind that<br/>
sells supplies and does blueprinting) - ask for a stamp pad that won't<br/>
smear on mylar.<br/>
