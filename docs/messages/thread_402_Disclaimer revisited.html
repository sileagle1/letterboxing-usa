                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you JDW and Bonnie for the concern over liability.  You have<br/>
probably already seen Erik's response and I put the Disclaimer<br/>
in full that we are using at the end of this post.<br/>
<br/>
I should explain for you and everyone else that the disclaimer<br/>
should be linked or included in every clues set.  If we should<br/>
go to an input form I think the submission process will take care<br/>
of that.  Right now I am doing it manually.  But if we should go<br/>
to a form, just to be safe I think there should be something<br/>
at the top of the form that says something like: "Please read<br/>
this before submitting clues."  Under that would be a statement<br/>
to the clue writer something like this: "Take special care in your<br/>
box placement and in the wording of your clues to not create an<br/>
unusually hazardous letterbox hunt.  If hazards are involved <br/>
because nature has provided unavoidable ones then please use<br/>
a difficulty rating for the clues and/or the terrain that <br/>
accurately reflects that, 'very difficult' or 'extreme', for<br/>
example.  This will alert the letterbox searcher to the<br/>
likelihood of hazards in the area to be searched."<br/>
<br/>
I read this over and it looks not at all like it should literally.<br/>
This is not what it would say, but hopefully the gist is coming<br/>
through.  My thought is that it is more responsible to add this<br/>
than to merely state in the disclaimer for the letterbox searcher<br/>
to take care and avoid pitfalls.  In other words, we can try to<br/>
avoid pitfalls at the time of box placement and by trying to<br/>
have clear clues that do not put people into places that we <br/>
would not have meant them to go.  In other words, say there is<br/>
a waterfall or cliff nearby.  Be careful that the clues do a good<br/>
job of keeping the searcher near the box and not near the hazard.<br/>
Its conceivable that someone may have there eyes on a map and not<br/>
on the area around them.  Bear that in mind if your box is in<br/>
and unusally hazardous area.<br/>
<br/>
I realize some hazards will be unavoidable, but when we know they<br/>
exist we should make sure there is a terrain rating in the high<br/>
end even if they are not specifically required to traverse the<br/>
hazard.  They may happen upon it anyway and it would have<br/>
then been good to make mention.  Common sense is always a good<br/>
measure and I realize we cannot avoid every potentiality/pitfall.<br/>
But I don't mind having something up front to remind the clues<br/>
writers as well as the searchers to not create undue dangers<br/>
for themselves or others.<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind we're trying to create a fun time<br/>
moreso than an extreme adventure.  And there may be kids involved,<br/>
so I think we should generally avoid areas where there may be a <br/>
huge drop-off, and of course never force them to climb a tree or<br/>
anything on that order.  Does this make sense?  I hope I'm not<br/>
just being paranoid.  Actually, I think I'm trying to react in a <br/>
healthy way to JDW and Bonnie's concerns.  We ARE in a litigious,<br/>
sue-happy society.  Any comments?<br/>

PS.  I think we would not want anyone to bungie jump over a bunch<br/>
of sharp rocks in order to snatch the letterbox out from between<br/>
them.  And then, of course we would not then want them to bungie<br/>
jump again to replace the box after stamping up.  Nobody would do<br/>
anything like that, would they?  I do not think it would hurt to<br/>
discuss this from time to time on the list so as new people come<br/>
through there will always be a live discussion of this issue.<br/>
Some newbies may come up with strange concepts in the interest<br/>
of being imaginative/creative.  So try to remind me to discuss<br/>
this from time to time or just bring it up yourselves when you<br/>
think of it.<br/>

&gt;I know we have a standard blurb about reading the waiver of<br/>
&gt;responsibility before someone goes out to hunt a box.  I'm wondering<br/>
&gt;if that's too weak, given the sue-happy society we unfortunately live<br/>
&gt;in.  Would it be worthwhile to have a statement such as "By hunting<br/>
&gt;for this letterbox, you agree to do so at your own risk and neither<br/>
&gt;Letterboxing USA, nor the author of these clues, assume any<br/>
&gt;responsibility for your actions as outlined in..."<br/>
&gt;Am I being paranoid?  Has this been covered inthe past?<br/>

&gt;For what it's worth I looked for waivers in a couple of hiking group's<br/>
&gt;web sites.  I didn't find any sort of waiver at the Appalachian Mountain<br/>
&gt;Club, either on their home page or the Berkshire chapter's site:<br/>
&gt;http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~berkamc/<br/>
&gt;However, the New England Hiking Group does have a disclaimer...here is: <br/>
&gt;DISCLAIMER<br/>
&gt;The New England Hiking Group is a group of people interested in becoming<br/>
&gt;involved in outdoor activities in our area. But, of course, certain<br/>
&gt;activities can be dangerous, and there is the possibility that you can<br/>
&gt;be injured. No one in the Group can or will be held liable for any injury<br/>
&gt;or any financial or other loss which may occur during a group activity.<br/>
&gt;It's best for you to evaluate your abilities and physical condition<br/>
&gt;before participating in any outdoor activity, be it with the Group or<br/>
&gt;on your own!<br/>
&gt;That's copied from http://welcome.to/nehg<br/>
&gt;Do we have any lawyers in our group?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is the actual Waiver we are using.  Yes, it was discussed at length<br/>
last fall, and I believe one or two people sought legal advice.<br/>
WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing, like any outdoor sport, carries the risk of unforseen<br/>
hazards.  "Letterboxing USA", and "The International Letterboxing Club"<br/>
support a policy of not knowingly placing letterboxes in areas that will<br/>
create undue risk to the letterbox hunter.  However, as conditions may<br/>
vary, it is the responsibility of the letterbox searcher to become<br/>
thoroughly familiar with the conditions in the area to be searched,<br/>
to adequately prepare for those conditions, and to conduct oneself<br/>
safely and responsibly with respect to those conditions and with respect<br/>
to his or her personal abilities and limitations.  "Letterboxing USA",<br/>
"The International Letterboxing Club" and the individual letterbox<br/>
sponsers assume no liability for events which may occur related <br/>
directly or indirectly to one's searching for a letterbox.   <br/>
<br/>
Do not let children hunt for letterboxes unsupervised.<br/>
<br/>
By reading and utilizing the letterbox clues posted on this web site,<br/>
you acknowledge the above conditions, and accept responsibility for<br/>
your own actions, and agree to hold non-liable the clubs and clue<br/>
writers, and further, agree to provide this disclaimer to any person<br/>
with whom you share these letterbox clues.<br/>
