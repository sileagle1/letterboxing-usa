Hi - I'm wondering if any of you will make a special stamp for our <br/>
family? We just went on our first hunt and it was so fun. I know <br/>
what kind of stamp I'd like to make, but would rather someone else <br/>
make it for me (3 kids under 6). I hope you all don't look down upon <br/>
me for wanting to make a family stamp this way. Thanks for any help. <br/>

<br/>
There are 11 Alphabet Bandits in all, with 9 being the most having boxed at any one time, and it was ESSENTIAL to my sanity to have a team stamp....  I'd be happy to carve you a team stamp, but I think you should give it a shot first.  After having seen over 100 commercially carved stamps in England, I have truly grown to appreciate the time and effort that goes into carving a stamp.  And while I appreciate the time a boxer took to place a box, I love to see hand carved stamps, no matter how crude the carver might think it is.  Your stamp doesn't have to be anything fancy, even if you just carved your initials into a vinyl eraser, it represents you and your dedication to the sport.  You can always carve something fancier when you have more time, and experience<br/>
<br/>
Having a team stamp really helps, in our case there is no possible way to stamp in discretely or in a timely fashion with that many people unless you have a group stamp.  It cuts stamping time down dramatically while still giving everyone time to get the box's stamp in their own logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
It was the best boxing decision I ever made (after deciding to go to Dartmoor that is!)<br/>
<br/>
Our first 4 or 5 ventures out went something like this<br/>
<br/>
TT: "OK everyone get your log books out"<br/>
TT: "Stop crying BB... you'll get to find the box next time"<br/>
CC: " I'm Hungry"<br/>
TT:  "We'll eat after everyone logs in"<br/>
TT: "Does everyone have their log book out?  OK, line up"<br/>
DD: "I need to use the little boy's tree"<br/>
EE: "OK, but come right back, FF, hold DD's log book"<br/>
TT: "Now does everyone have their logbook?... good"<br/>
TT: stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink<br/>
EE: "Now everyone get your personal stamps out.. CC.. you forgot your stamp??, OK use your thumb"<br/>
KK: "I have to go to the little girl's tree!"<br/>
EE:  "I'll take her, you stamp in and pack everyone up<br/>
TT: stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink, stamp, ink<br/>
EE: "Where's DD?  isn't he back from the little boy's tree yet"<br/>
TT: "Pack your things in your back packs, don't forget to wrap you stamps in the paper towel and put them in the plastic bags, then we'll go eat, EE, you rehide the box, while I go find DD"<br/>
<br/>
Everyone gets packed up and ready to go only to realize <br/>
<br/>
TT: "I FORGOT TO STAMP THE DANGED LOGBOOK!!!!!!!"<br/>

Hi Kimberly,<br/>
I sometimes carve stamps for other people. I usually charge $12 for<br/>
the carving. Just let me know what you want and I will let you know if<br/>
I can do it.<br/>
Thanks <br/>

I thought I would chime in with my two cents. I think that the A to <br/>
Z Bandits are right on, and I would encourage you to carve your own <br/>
stamp. You always have the option to recarve another personal stamp <br/>
anytime you wish. We still use the first stamp I carved as our <br/>
personal stamp. This stamp is certainly no beauty, but <br/>
the "Ubiquitous Flower" as some letterboxers have called it has been <br/>
many neat places and even though we have added to our personal <br/>
stamps by one each for our dogs,one for gwen and one for myself we <br/>
can't check a letterbox without using our first stamp. Try to figure <br/>
out something fairly simple and save that more intricate stamp for <br/>
later when your carving abilities are on par with your ideas.<br/>
