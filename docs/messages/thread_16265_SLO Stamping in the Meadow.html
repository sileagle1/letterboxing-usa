wonderful event. Sir B and JM were fantastic hosts and meeting fellow <br/>
letterboxers, both famous and infamous was a thrill. All the stamps <br/>
were inspiring and a pleasure to find and add to my book. I will <br/>
treasure each and every miniature masterpiece.<br/>
We had a very good camping trip and Lopex Lake was beautiful. <br/>
Unfortunately we were unable to do Pandora's Chaos letterboxes as <br/>
there was a cycling event going on and they were using the trails we <br/>
needed. <br/>
Sunday was a blast too as Simon was able to do his windsurfing and I <br/>
was able to spend some time exploring SLO. My non boxing son <br/>
persuaded me to buy Mossflower on tape for our return journey which <br/>
we all enjoyed. <br/>
Look forward to returning to SLO to do many more boxes!<br/>

<br/>
That is cool- Mossflower is one of the great stories, in my opinion.  <br/>
Andrew, even though a non-boxer, was very fun to talk with and good <br/>
company for certain.  Bring him with you when you return, please.<br/>
