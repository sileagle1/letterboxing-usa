                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Triple V Gang chose our name because there are three of us, V-Mama, V-Dad and V-Boy.  V happens to be our surname initial but our first day out V-dad also decided that Triple V stood for Veni-Vidi-Vici and that fits this hobby as well.  When I was designing our signature stamp I just used the Triple V theme one more time.  We don't have individual stamps and so far we have always gone together so for now we are always a group.  I can see that changing as V-boy gets older and doesn't want to hang out with his boring parents anymore, but for now we are the Triple V Gang, all for one and one for all!  :) V-MamaF19 HH2 P1 X2<br/>
