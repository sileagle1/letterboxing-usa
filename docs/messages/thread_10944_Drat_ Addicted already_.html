<br/>
Well, I got my first two letterboxes: Night Train (were actually two <br/>
Amtrak trains in the station) and Leon's Bookstore both in San Luis <br/>
Obispo, CA. Planning on getting to a few more this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Now then, the Isla Vista Juggling Festival is coming up on Easter <br/>
weekend. JugglerMouse and I are planning on planting a box down at <br/>
UCSB for the event. I am working on the stamp right now. JugglerMouse <br/>
has designed a double tangram for the image. It should be really <br/>
smurfy.<br/>
<br/>
I know that you guys probably will scoff at my ignorance but I am <br/>
enthusiastic and more than a little bent.<br/>
<br/>
What all are folks using for carving material? I got the thick white <br/>
stuff (Staetdler's?) and it carves very nicely (says "it carves like <br/>
butter"). It also takes a transfer image with the use of <br/>
printers/copiers that use toner. Just a low heat iron and the image <br/>
goes over. Funny, you have to print it out normally so that the image <br/>
reverses when you transfer it.<br/>
<br/>
I saw the stuff you use UV light to set. Anybody doing that much <br/>
detail? <br/>
<br/>
As far as carving tools, I am using an X-acto Woodcarving Knife and <br/>
the Speedball Cutter Set. Anybody using anything else? <br/>
<br/>
On clues, most of the things I have seen have been pretty straight <br/>
forward ones. What is the communities feelings about clues like:<br/>
<br/>
My first is in stop but not in pot.<br/>
My second is me and can blink.<br/>
<br/>
In otherwords, s and then i. Do riddle clues just discourage?<br/>
<br/>
Juggler Mouse and Miss Emily found a hitchhiker stamp on top of <br/>
Madonna Mountain. I am thinking that once my custom stamp is done, I <br/>
will start my "cooties" one as a hitchhiker. Again, what do folks <br/>
think of that? How about cuckoo clues; folks think this is rude? I <br/>
think they both are exciting. Is this all too presumptous for a <br/>
newbie? <br/>
<br/>
My 19 year old daughter is also gone for this. Gack! Told her she had <br/>
better carve her own if she wants to plant.<br/>

One of my favorites is the Spirit of Dartmoor in Portland, OR! <br/>
<br/>
I use Speedball Speedy-Stamp "the pink stuff" I find that the "white <br/>
stuff" crumbles a bit after repeated stampings. An Exacto Knife and <br/>
the #1 carving tool are my tools of choice. <br/>
<br/>
And I still transfer my images the old fashioned way with tracing <br/>
paper and pencil lead rubbing. :-)<br/>

<br/>
&gt; What all are folks using for carving material? I got the thick<br/>
&gt; white stuff (Staetdler's?) and it carves very nicely (says "it<br/>
&gt; carves like butter").<br/>
<br/>
Most people either use erasures, but they tend to be limited in size <br/>
and scope so I use the "pink stuff" by Speedball which is also very <br/>
common.  (Ask Emily if you want to see some--I know she's got a <br/>
little!)  Staetdler's stuff--more commonly known as Mastercarve <br/>
(that's the name of the product--Staetdler is the company that makes <br/>
it) is very good.  (I especially like that they write their moto, "it <br/>
carves like butter" in Spanish too!  Se corte como mantequilla.)  <br/>
It's really nice because it's so thick--you can even carve on both <br/>
sides of it if you want.  Or even the EDGE of the material!  I also <br/>
love the smell of the stuff.  It's a little more expensive than the <br/>
pink stuff--probably for the extra thickness, but it's very good <br/>
stuff.  If there's one thing I'll say NOT to carve with, it's <br/>
the "white stuff" by Speedball.  Crumbles faster than you can <br/>
imagine.  I think it's called Speedycut.  Avoid like the plauge!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I saw the stuff you use UV light to set. Anybody doing that much <br/>
&gt; detail? <br/>
<br/>
I was looking at that stuff at Laws not to long ago.  I've never <br/>
heard of anyone trying it, but I find the idea fascinating.  I was <br/>
half tempted to try it just to see how it works, but then I saw the <br/>
price and thought better of it!  But if you want to give it a whirl, <br/>
I'd love to hear how it works!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As far as carving tools, I am using an X-acto Woodcarving Knife and <br/>
&gt; the Speedball Cutter Set. Anybody using anything else? <br/>
<br/>
Most people use X-acto knives and/or the Speedball cutting tools.  <br/>
Myself included.  Not sure what else someone might try using.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do riddle clues just discourage?<br/>
<br/>
Depends on the person.  There's nothing wrong with riddle clues--some <br/>
people PREFER them, but other don't.  I say make any kind of clues <br/>
you want--I for one love particularly clever, witty, or "different" <br/>
types of clues.  Just keep in mind that not everyone enjoys riddles, <br/>
and they might pass by your boxes and look for "easy" ones instead.  <br/>
There's nothing wrong with that, though.  If you make riddle clues, <br/>
there WILL be people who'll go out of their way to track them down!  <br/>
=)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How about cuckoo clues; folks think this is rude?<br/>
<br/>
Some people enjoy it.  Some don't.  *shrug*  The story of every <br/>
letterbox.  I'm not big on cuckoo clues, though.  I'd rather go out <br/>
and deliberately hunt a box down in the first place!  But there's an <br/>
equally dedicated group of people that wouldn't want it any other <br/>
way.  <br/>
<br/>
