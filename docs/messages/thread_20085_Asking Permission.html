know - especially if it is to ask permission for something.<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 really good thoughts for letterboxes, but for at least one of<br/>
these, I think I should get the permission of the place first.  This is<br/>
a well known establishment, and I doubt there is an "owner" I can talk<br/>
to... who would I ask and what do I say?<br/>
<br/>
Also - how do you explain letterboxing to them if they have NO CLUE what<br/>
you are talking about?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the answers and advice =]<br/>

<br/>
We planted 3 boxes in FL this summer and had to ask permission  each time.  <br/>
We discovered that having your log book and the box you plan to  place with you <br/>
helps to describe things more easily for someone who is  'clueless.'  It also <br/>
gets them excited about the whole idea.  Just  smile when you talk, and treat <br/>
everyone like they are the one in charge.   Everyone likes to feel  important <br/>
even if they cannot give you the okay, it  will put them in a good mind set <br/>
to hand you over to their supervisor.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

from the website, or make up your own info-flyer. Include a photo of a<br/>
letterbox or mention that it is usually only the size of a<br/>
sandwich-saver. Write a letter explaining your intent &amp; asking<br/>
permission, and offer to meet with them at their convenience if they<br/>
have concersn.  Then, MAIL it to the owner, giving your complete name,<br/>
address, &amp; phone (I'm shy too) &amp; hope for a response.<br/>
