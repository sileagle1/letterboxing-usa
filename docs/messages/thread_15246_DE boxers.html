Tower clue.  Some crucial words were omitted when the clue was <br/>
reinstated recently.  Thanks to those who pointed out the omission. <br/>
As of last week, both the Henlopen Tower and the Cape Henlopen Devil <br/>
letterboxes were in good shape.  We introduced our friends from <br/>
Minnesota to letterboxing while we were at the beach, but we found <br/>
only two clues for Minneapolis boxes to send home with them. Are <br/>
there more?<br/>
