Hope every one had a nice Holiday. I was out in sunny Southern California <br/>
looking for birds and places to hide  letterboxes. I was not able to get to <br/>
the few that were hidden there but I did manage to hide some. Below is one:<br/>

A Snails Pace Letterbox clues<br/>
Frank G.Bonelli Regional Park in Southern California<br/>
Near Pamona,Los Angeles County, California<br/>
December 22, 2000<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park off 210 Freeway and go to the West Picnic Valley area.From the <br/>
from the Clark Kent changing booth go east along the walkway (parallel to the <br/>
parking lot) toward the restrooms. Have a drink there and then proceed to the <br/>
bolder. From the bolder go 60 degrees toward a water source. From there go 30 <br/>
degrees to the green hitching post. Then proceed 270 degrees west up a <br/>
dirtroad.  Past the recumbent pine at the beginning of the road. Halfway up <br/>
the hill you will notice a small Euclyptus tree on the right. Look under the <br/>
brick behind the log to the right of that small tree.<br/>

Good job hiding letterboxes in Southern Cal!!!  A less expensive attraction<br/>
than the usual down there for people to go to with their families.  Keep up<br/>
the good work!<br/>
<br/>
