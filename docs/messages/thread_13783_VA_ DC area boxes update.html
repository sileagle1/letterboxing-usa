Riverbend park to see the site that was host to such a great <br/>
gathering!:-)<br/>
We got Muskrat Ramble, Bee's Knees and Billy Goat Gruff and then it <br/>
was too hot and we had to take a lunch break! Did not even attempt <br/>
the other boxes in the park. Picked up Elvis HH at Bee's Knees, so he <br/>
will be flying along with me for awhile.<br/>
Then it was off to the Jolly G-Man's Difficult Run letterboxes. If I <br/>
had had an updated clue, I would have known to bring fresh notebooks <br/>
for both of these! They are overflowing with stamps!! If you go out <br/>
to get these boxes, please bring new notebooks! It is also a great <br/>
time to see the Potomac practically overflowing the Gorge area! That <br/>
water is amazing!!!<br/>
On the way to Dulles, we picked up The Christmas Tree Graveyards Box. <br/>
Saw lots of deer hanging around in folks backyards as we traipsed <br/>
down this trail.<br/>
All in all a productive day. <br/>
