                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've already been informed there might be some confusion just before <br/>
box 3. Could you please replace the third paragraph of the clues with <br/>
the following paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
Return to the trail, heading downhill. Jump the small stream at the <br/>
bottom and head uphill again. Here's where you finally find the <br/>
Osprey Loop. Follow to the left. You will reach a T intersection  go <br/>
left. The trail will quickly come to a Y  stay right. (You want to <br/>
circle the hilltop meadow along the tree line.) When you get to three <br/>
cut logs on either side of the trail, take a rest. Look in the base <br/>
of the fallen tree from which these logs were cut. Under a rock and <br/>
some bark you will find Box 3, Falco spevarious. Carefully re-hide <br/>
and continue on the loop.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for everything!<br/>
