Three generations of my family and I spent part of our last day on <br/>
PEI this past week on your letterbox hunt. We really enjoyed the <br/>
nature trail and learned a few things on the way. We found the <br/>
letterbox exactly where you had planted it. Lovely stamp! However, <br/>
the ink pad had gotten wet and ink had smudged the notebook and the <br/>
inside of the plastic bag. I replaced the inkpad with a blue ink pad <br/>
and wiped out the ink from the bag with a paper towel. I also added <br/>
another plastic bag to keep the notebook separate from the stamp and <br/>
pad. We were about the 11th group to stamp in.  Thanks for the quest.<br/>

PS. I tried to send this note directly to the email address specified <br/>
in your letterbox but it was undeliverable.  Perhaps I copied it down <br/>
incorrectly.<br/>
