followed the clues to the "Anniversary" letter box near Des Moines, <br/>
Washington &amp; found the box.  <br/>
<br/>
The only rubber stamp Jim &amp; I brought with us to Washington was <br/>
Jim's legal signature stamp, a rubber stamp.  Jim uses a power <br/>
wheelchair.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know if there are any other people who use wheelchairs who <br/>
are hunting for letter boxes?<br/>
<br/>
Actually, we were in the area because the 3 of us were on our way to <br/>
my mother's memorial service at a Unitarian church near Salt Water <br/>
State Park, Washington.  We had taken a bus from a hotel and had to <br/>
walk and roll about a mile (not a problem) along roads which were <br/>
surrounded with beautiful trees &amp; other greenery.  My mother was 89 <br/>
when she died &amp; she would have liked the idea of the hike through <br/>
the park, and even finding a "treasure".   <br/>
