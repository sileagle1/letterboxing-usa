My mom, mom's friend and I have had large patches made they are about <br/>
4*8 oval and say 25 letterboxes on them with a picture of a mail box. <br/>
they cost about $10.00 to have made. <br/>
I would like to have smaller maybe 2" round patches made. They would <br/>
be cheaper and many could fit onto an orange blazer. The problem <br/>
would be that I have to order them by 50's or 100's. There are only <br/>
four of us who go hiking together. This is where you come in. Would <br/>
you like to be able to purchse a patch for a reasonable cost to <br/>
display for others to see? I was thinking of having a basic patch and <br/>
then patches for finding 25, 50, 75, 100 ect... I would post my <br/>
address where people could get them on the web, at EMS, and in <br/>
letterboxes. I know that there are some areas that don't even have 25 <br/>
letterboxes yet, which is why I was thinking of a general patch.<br/>
Also people have been interested in window clings. What's your view? <br/>
I would like to have a cling in my window so that other letterboxers <br/>
could see we were out in the woods. I don't have an estimate for <br/>
these. What size would you like to see?<br/>

I'd be interested in purchasing a couple of patches if they are general enough. Would you want input on design?  Wouldn't be interested in patches with numbers since there's so little activity here in Calif. <br/>
<br/>
A 2" patch sounds like an appropriate size.<br/>

Debbie, wow great job.   If anyone is interested I say go for it .<br/>
   At the request of the LBNA "masters" I have also sent a patch design out <br/>
to the embroidery shop...one with an LBNA logo and small patches with P &amp; F <br/>
numbers (similar in size to scouting merit badges).  I am waiting for the <br/>
first ones to be finished and sent back with the pricing info for posting on <br/>
the LBNA site and so I can send a GIF file or photo of the patches in to be <br/>
posted.  I apologize for the wait...I should have had this done about a month <br/>
and a half ago.   I have been holding off posting anything to the list <br/>
because "those in the know" still need to approve the patch design. According <br/>
to the shop they would take orders directly from individuals by phone, mail <br/>
or Internet.  <br/>
<br/>
Debbie, I procrastinated and you beat me to the punch!   My suggestion is <br/>
that local Letterboxing patches are a great idea ... it doesn't hurt to have <br/>
more than one patch and still have an LBNA patch and P# &amp; F# patches.<br/>
<br/>
Good job,<br/>
Mohmers<br/>

I think keep the numbers off the patch/<br/>
but how about a sub patch<br/>
Way back in cub scouts if you got extra skills you got extra Arrowheads<br/>
Copper for 1, Silver for 5, Gold for 10...<br/>
how about copper silver and gold mailboxes underneath the patch<br/>
or a simple curved patch to fit the outside of the regular patch<br/>

<br/>
The group needs to come to a general consensus on a<br/>
patch design, and then find a  Boy's Life Magazine or<br/>
a Scouting magazine...Hmm seems like I got thousands<br/>
in my collection...oh wait I do.....there are more<br/>
than 25 patch makers listed in some issues, some with<br/>
over 80 years of experience, they can save money on<br/>
smaller batches...or runs as they call them, and you<br/>
can get rockered segments which go around the<br/>
patch...they already make them in increments of 5 for<br/>
veterans patches in Boy Scouts.... When I used to<br/>
order the Oa flaps for my lodge they would cost about<br/>
1.75 each..in runs of 250, slightly more for smaller<br/>
runs.... just an idea..<br/>

Jeremy (and All), hopefully I will be sending a gif file in tommorow showing  <br/>
patch, P#&amp;F# badge and window decal designs and an order form.  Looks like we <br/>
have enough interest for the initial LbNA logo patch and window decal order.  <br/>
Not enough yet for the P# &amp; F#  merit badges but we will see.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Everyone,<br/>
Mohmers<br/>
<br/>
Look for the order form on Wednesday.<br/>
