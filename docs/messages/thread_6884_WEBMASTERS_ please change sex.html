a broken link, has a typo in the text.  It incorrectly reads, "secure <br/>
on HIS perch", instead of "secure on HER perch".  <br/>
When you're finally able to send her to the Clues page (you have my <br/>
sympathies for the huge backlog), perhaps you can make this minor <br/>
adjustment.  I fear someone may mistake the prose as presently worded <br/>
as a clue of some sort, &amp; go off half-cocked searching in the wrong <br/>
spot.  Besides, no sense incurring the wrath of a 12' hen...<br/>
I shall now crawl back under my desk to avoid being struck by any of <br/>
the tomatoes being hurled around the list of late.<br/>
