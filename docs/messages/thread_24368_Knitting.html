                    <div class="plaintext-content">My dear sir,<br/>
<br/>
My feelings of dismay at having my letterboxing reputation dragged <br/>
through the mud overwhelm me. I fear your reputed incisive logic has <br/>
more in common with an out-of-control weed-eater than a precision X-<br/>
acto knife.<br/>
<br/>
You knit, sir? I stand amazed! Given the impetuous nature of your <br/>
accusations heretofore, I would think you might lack the patience. <br/>
As far as camouflaging the bark zapper Use larger cables in your <br/>
pattern next time.<br/>
<br/>
As to your so-called "proof" of my perfidy, I will address each <br/>
accusation individually, 1 at a time, and you will see that they <br/>
actually prove nothing except my belief that good manners and <br/>
etiquette do not stop at letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
So I contemplate dealing out mayhem to parking space stealers, do I? <br/>
And you have never felt the injustice of sitting in a parking lot <br/>
with the turn signal flashing, waiting for a car to back out of a <br/>
space, only for a car to come in the other direction and zip into <br/>
the space before you could? Who among us would not contemplate some <br/>
well-deserved retribution? The proof of my good manners, sir, is <br/>
that I have never dealt out the retribution such scandalous actions <br/>
deserve!<br/>
<br/>
You mention that my favorite insect (I find the term "creepy crawly" <br/>
offensive) is the flying cockroach. In fact, sir, these are more <br/>
properly called "palmetto bugs" and they can be extremely effective <br/>
for clearing a room, as well as clearing the area around a <br/>
letterbox, much more politely than walking up and telling people to <br/>
leave. I usually carry at least 2 with me for just such an occasion.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, what is wrong with planting a few cooties on new boxers? As <br/>
I'm sure you know, I frequent the Newboxers list and help out as I <br/>
may, but all the e-mail in the world will only present theory to the <br/>
newbies. The theory must be backed up with practical experience. <br/>
Therefore, I plant a few cooties on the newbies I meet to teach them <br/>
what I consider the most important point of etiquette in <br/>
letterboxing--how to contact the placer.<br/>
<br/>
That's right. They are given the opportunity to contact me and tell <br/>
me how it felt to be "cootied". They need to learn that it is not <br/>
enough to merely send a Found report. A good note to a placer <br/>
includes details about the weather, trail condition, wildflowers <br/>
seen, room left in the logbook, anything that will help the planter <br/>
gain knowledge about the condition of their box. A good note will <br/>
also allow the planter to vicariously relive your experience and <br/>
share a bit of your own joy in that sprained ankle that sent you <br/>
face first into the mud.<br/>
<br/>
I digress. I would never steal the Store. The Store should be <br/>
available for all to visit since good etiquette is essential to <br/>
successful letterboxing. As far as my integrity and innocence in <br/>
this matter, I am sure that Eidolon will be able to reassure you <br/>
that I am not the one you seek.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of throwing accusations around willy-nilly, I really feel <br/>
you need to concentrate and focus on the clues before making any <br/>
more accusations. I grew up in the South, Inspector Bacon; good <br/>
manners and fair dealing are as vital to a Southerner as air and <br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
Bless your heart, dear sir, but you aren't from around here, are you?<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Knit Wit<br/>

<br/>
I can't decide if you are the most inept sleuth ever, are using a <br/>
random name generator for your "suspect list" or are just a <br/>
professional politician changes opinions with the wind but I swear <br/>
there are fewer changes of direction in a ping pong match than in <br/>
your investigation. Granted, my own perverse curiosity has forced me <br/>
to keep watching your train wreck; this is better than the OJ trial, <br/>
The Jerry Springer Show and The Gong Show all rolled into one but <br/>
when it comes to investigating, you are no Jacques Clouseau, you are <br/>
not even Inspector Gadget; in all honesty your skill is probably even <br/>
surpassed by the esteemed Rosco P. Coltrane. And yet I keep reading. <br/>
But you crossed the line when your blindly thrown dart hit Knit Wit's <br/>
name (who were you aiming for, King Kong?) and you tried to drag her <br/>
name through the ever-growing pile of <br/>
sh.................oddy "research" that is accumulating at your feet, <br/>
though it is probably up to your knees by now. <br/>
<br/>
So now Knit Wit is your thief? For today at least, she is your #1 <br/>
suspect? You actually think she stole the Store of Good Manners? That <br/>
is about as ridiculous as David Hasselhoff's singing career. All you <br/>
have done is baselessly blame people all over the country. You <br/>
accuse, learn how completely poor a judge of character you are, then <br/>
take another stab, hoping to get lucky. Just how much time and money <br/>
have you spent on your obviously arbitrary pursuit of suspects so <br/>
far? Who will be next; Ms. Post herself?<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you a little story. It was a hot day in July at Stone <br/>
Mountain Park, the site of the LBSE Annual Event and also the first <br/>
letterboxing event I ever attended. I was armed with an ink pad and a <br/>
notebook and a list of names. I did at least have markers at that <br/>
point so had enough experience to know colors are much less boring. <br/>
Wow, I can barely remember that, I actually had new Marvy Brush <br/>
Markers back then, not the beat up ones I have today (which probably <br/>
are the exact same markers in all likelihood). That was before I <br/>
bought the Crayola ones for their carrying case and just gave all <br/>
those markers to the neighbor kids since they are too wet (the <br/>
markers, not the kids). Anyway, to try and get a jump on things, I <br/>
arrived at the park when it opened first thing in the morning and <br/>
started boxing while it was still dark. Boxing in the dark, my that <br/>
has become quite a pattern in the time since then for me. Any box can <br/>
be made into a night box with enough effort though these days it <br/>
tends to be the end of the day where I run into that problem, not the <br/>
beginning Anyway, I nabbed a few boxes and tried to avoid the other <br/>
weirdos I saw on the trails in those predawn hours since I at least <br/>
knew enough not to be muggled. Man some of those people were scary! <br/>
Why would people be out climbing over rocks to hide behind them and <br/>
having hushed conversations in the woods when it is still dark <br/>
anyway? Eventually I made my way over to the gathering area and was <br/>
quite surprised to see all those strange people I was avoiding <br/>
earlier start strolling in as well. Obviously I just smiled and tried <br/>
to wash the entire bizarre memory from my mind until now thanks <br/>
Instigator Bacon, I will send the therapy bill to you. Please email <br/>
me your address off list.<br/>
<br/>
Where was I? Oh yeah, the gathering. There was activity everywhere: <br/>
adults, kids, dogs, food, plus a nice mix of sweltering Atlanta heat, <br/>
bugs, coffee cups with stamps (I am still mad I missed one that was <br/>
specifically pointed out to me by She Who Plants; it was the one in <br/>
the purple cup) and funny colored fingers. Yet one of the most <br/>
memorable things about this event was when I heard a lady asking <br/>
everyone "are you Eidolon?" until she eventually came to me. Well, I <br/>
was not sure what I had done so of course said "no, I am Green <br/>
Tortuga" but apparently she did not believe me. It turns out the <br/>
stalker lady was actually Knit Wit and she had tracked me down <br/>
because she specifically wanted to meet me. Why anyone would want to <br/>
subject themselves to meeting me is beyond my comprehension but <br/>
people do the craziest things sometimes umm, yeah, we are talking <br/>
about Knit Wit, sorry. She was extremely welcoming and really made me <br/>
feel at home. Well, not really "at home" since that would probably <br/>
have involved air conditioning and cold drink of some sort, but you <br/>
know what I mean; she made me feel as comfortable as one can be <br/>
sitting on a concrete picnic table in the middle of summer in <br/>
Atlanta. <br/>
<br/>
But again, I digress. Knit Wit told me she knew I had been boxing for <br/>
a little while but she also knew I did not ever join the newboxers <br/>
list so she had taken it upon herself to find me at this event and <br/>
make sure I had some of the finer points of boxing etiquette <br/>
explained to me. As we sat there talking, it was amazing the things I <br/>
learned from her, not only about boxing etiquette but about life in <br/>
general. One topic she kept coming back to was the importance of <br/>
taking the time to contact the placer. I told her I always logged my <br/>
boxes as `found' but she said that is not enough. What should happen <br/>
in a polite community such as letterboxing is that the finder <br/>
attempts to let the placer relive the thrill of the hunt vicariously <br/>
through the comments made on their box. Simply saying "found", while <br/>
nice and at least useful, is not the proper way to go about things. <br/>
She actually recommended a book to me to help me understand what she <br/>
was talking about and to reinforce the point she was trying to make; <br/>
Amy Vanderbilt's New Complete Book of Etiquette: The Guide to <br/>
Gracious Living (Garden City: Doubleday, '67). When she said the <br/>
title I of course laughed, thinking "what do I need with some *burp* <br/>
outdated *scratch* book on how to *spit* be polite?" but she <br/>
persisted and I must say, while it is not vital that a letterboxer <br/>
know which fork is which, reading the Correspondence section from <br/>
this publication is invaluable and I just wish there was a way to get <br/>
all other boxers to read it as well.<br/>
<br/>
So no, Sleuthful Swine, Knit Wit cannot possibly be the party who <br/>
stole the Store of Good Manners. In fact, she actively PROMOTES <br/>
proper letterboxing etiquette as well as inspires others to go to the <br/>
store and buy a book on good manners for themselves, not steal one. <br/>
If this does not completely exonerate her then I am at a loss to know <br/>
what other proof you might require. Please, feel free to point your <br/>
not-exactly-a-bloodhound nose in a different direction and just move <br/>
on to your next "suspect" but leave Knit Wit out of your inane search.<br/>
