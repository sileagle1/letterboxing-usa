may be interested in attending---<br/>
<br/>
We have an opportunity to coordinate a last minute exchange<br/>
gathering for Silver Eagle, an avid letterboxer from a really BIG<br/>
state in the contiguous United States who will be visiting our neck<br/>
of the woods next week. We have two 'windows of opportunity' during<br/>
which we may be able to meet with our mutual friend in letterboxing--<br/>
<br/>
******************<br/>
<br/>
Would anybody be able to attend one or either of the following<br/>
events?<br/>
<br/>
--Monday, 10 Nov 03--evening/dinner event in the Olympia area<br/>
(thinking along the lines of the Oyster House on the marina--upscale<br/>
sports bar type of an establishment that is very welcome to children<br/>
or some other similar environs)<br/>
<br/>
--Saturday, 15 Nov 03--0900-1030 quick exchange event at Wapato Park<br/>
in Tacoma (with all exchanges ending precisely at 1030 so one Silver<br/>
Eagle can catch his return flight home shortly thereafter)<br/>
<br/>
******************<br/>
<br/>
Please let me know if you would be able to attend such an event<br/>
(either post to the board or write me directly)! Also, include the<br/>
number of folks in your party who would also be able to attend. I<br/>
need to know the details about the Monday night event by tomorrow<br/>
afternoon at the latest. As for the Saturday event, we have a bit<br/>
more coordination time.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
