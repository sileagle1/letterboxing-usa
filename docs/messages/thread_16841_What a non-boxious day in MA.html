today and I either couldn't find them or the parks were closed with no <br/>

<br/>
I started out for the Troll King boxes in Longmeadow, but the park was closed <br/>
and there were park personnel in the parking lot, so I couldn't park :-(  <br/>
Strike One <br/>
<br/>
Then I went out to Springfield St. Cemetery in Agawam to look for the Zodiac <br/>
box, but after driving and walking around for quite a while in the cold wind, <br/>
I decided to abandon the search (there were also quite a few people in the <br/>
cemetery, so I didn't want to attract too much attention).  Strike Two<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, I went out to Robinson State Park in Agawam to find that the park <br/>
gate was closed and they do not allow parking near the gate.  Is there any other <br/>
place to park?  Is the park only open on weekends?  hmmmm.... things to ponder <br/>
 Strike Three.<br/>
<br/>
After the third strike, I decided to head home.  Too bad I didn't know sooner <br/>
that I would strike out today, or I would have just come home sooner and <br/>
planted a few boxes in Gay City State Park instead.....<br/>

Tough day on the trails. Springfield St. Cemetery<br/>
isn't usually that busy. Bad luck there. I had no idea<br/>
that Robinson closed during the winter. I was just<br/>
there two weeks ago checking on my boxes. Maybe they<br/>
closed on Nov. 1? I'll have to check into that.<br/>
