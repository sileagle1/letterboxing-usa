of boxes, prizes food and old and new friends. Well worth the 650 mile trip!! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We clocked 20 boxes during the event and 13 before and after (including our <br/>
100th find) and added 15 new exchanges to our index. <br/>
<br/>
It was great to see Sir Balthazar, Jugglermouse, PrincessLea, Amanda from <br/>
Seattle, the Jiggs Family, and Snail Lady and her crew. But, for me at least, <br/>
meeting the famous (now, more like INfamous) Ryan Carpenter, alias Green Turtle <br/>
(with an AT tacked on to the turtle's sneakers now!) was a real treat. I even <br/>
got him to autograph my complete copy of his AT Adventure postings! <br/>
<br/>
Sir B and Jugglermouse, you deserve a grand bow for your efforts and success <br/>
and another big thank you for introducing us to Stamp Luis Obispo, a <br/>
wonderland for stampers! <br/>
<br/>
We'll give you a year to rest up, then we'll do it again, right?!!<br/>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br/>
 but good impressions. Sir B<br/>
