was absolutely wonderful!!!  Thanks so much to Funhog and Thom Cheney<br/>
for hosting and organizing this really fun get together and thanks to A.<br/>
Rose for the wonderful event stamps.  The weather was great and there<br/>
were many stamps placed for the event.  Lots of cool letterboxers showed<br/>
up and it was just fantastic to meet those of you who attended!<br/>
<br/>
John and I were not able to hang around and nab boxes, since we were<br/>
expected at a company picnic (which was planned AFTER the letterboxing<br/>
gathering was).  However, we did manage to get one box later on this<br/>
afternoon, which will be yanked after this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Leger de maine for the appearance of Flutterby<br/>
(marvelous stamp) and for the fabulous cookies!  What a pal!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Also special thanks to Scott Redd for his terrific and unique Nebraska<br/>
letterbox that many of us got to participate in.<br/>
<br/>
What a fun, memorable day.  It just helped to reaffirm what this hobby<br/>
is all about.  Good times and positive fun!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
