Have you tried FreeCycle?  It's an movement not too unlike boxing.<br/>

Hey, there's a program called Fineprint that allows you to print <br/>
multiple pages of clues onto one sheet of paper.  I think the software <br/>
runs about $50 or so but it's awesome and totally worth it in the long <br/>
run!  I usually print 2-4 pages of clues on one sheet of paper.  If you <br/>
have difficulty reading small print then you may want to limit it to 2 <br/>
pages per sheet.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

I might also point out--if you don't want the hassle of copying and<br/>
pasting clues to a Word document or whatever ink-saving method is<br/>
available, a lot of people don't realize that there a "Print friendly"<br/>
link on clues hosted on LbNA that will help save ink.<br/>
<br/>
Another money saving suggestion is to set your printer to print using<br/>
black ink. Color ink cartriges usually cost more than their black<br/>
counterparts, so if you make sure it prints everything with black ink<br/>
you'll be using the cheaper alternative. =)<br/>

A few families on my route swear by printpal.com.  I haven't used them<br/>
yet -- they just recently told me about the site at a neighborhood garage<br/>
sale.  I'm going to give it a try. The families that told me about printpal<br/>
claim the "compatible" cartridges work just as well for them as the real<br/>
thang. And one guy even goes to the "ultimate frugalness" and refills his<br/>
own from the ink at their site.  I figure I'll try one of the black ink<br/>
compatible ones and see.<br/>
<br/>
I have an HP printer also.  You probably know this, but just in case you<br/>
don't....<br/>
<br/>
I receive that little "your ink cartridge will be empty in less than two<br/>
seconds and you'd better put in a new cartridge, like, yesterday, or you're<br/>
going to be in deep doggie doodoo!!!" message from HP waaaaay before the ink<br/>
is anywhere *close* to being gone.  So I always let the cartridge run<br/>
completely out before replacing.  I don't want HP getting any more of my<br/>
money than absolutely necessary.  But, I'll give HP credit.  They sure do<br/>
put up a good effort to get my money as soon as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I also do what others have mentioned -- cut &amp; paste into a Word doc *just*<br/>
what I'm going to need to find the box, scale down the font size to fit more<br/>
than one set of clues, and use both sides of the paper.  It's not like it<br/>
should be *that* big of a deal to me.  I've only found something like 60<br/>
boxes so far, so I'm not exactly printing out clues to a hundred boxes a<br/>
week or anything.  But with the price of gas, not to mention the price of<br/>
Merrick's dog food and treats (because the family that letterboxes together<br/>
needs to eat more calories together -- or so the dogs tell me), every li'l<br/>
bit helps.<br/>

<br/>
The copy/paste/ print on both sides of paper is fabulous! I'm VERY <br/>
frugal,too.  Just an FYI, that if you do opt to buy a new cartridge instead <br/>
of refill yours.... most Staples/ Office Max/ Office Depot, etc.. will give <br/>
you a free ream of paper for every ink cartridge you bring in! I don't think <br/>
I've ever had to buy paper for my printer.<br/>

I liked the idea of not copying any extraneous info and only printing what you need in a smaller font. My problem would be mis-interpreting what would be "extraneous info" and accidentally leaving out a vital piece of the clue! Oh who am I kidding, even when I have the whole darn clue I sometimes still can't find the box! Ink is the least of my problems...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So to recap and add my own 2...<br/>
<br/>
Set your printer to Fast Draft or Draft mode, black ink only, if you can.  <br/>
<br/>
Block copy the clues into a word processor and get rid of the frames and info you really don't need.<br/>
<br/>
Go to Print Preview in Word and stretch that text to the limits of the page by dragging your margins.  Unless you are going to punch holes and put it into a binder, you don't need a huge margin.<br/>
<br/>
Use both sides of the paper if you feel like flipping the pages over one at a time...  saves ink and paper.<br/>
<br/>
You can reduce the font size, or fool around with changing the font, to save lots of space. A font change in the same point size can save you lots of space and ink. A sans serif narrow font will save a lot of room. <br/>
<br/>
(Personally, I usually bump up the font size because my progressive lenses can be a dizzying TRIP on the trail so I try to not use them while walking; I can read a big point size by just slowing down a bit or stopping for a few secs without the glasses and don't have a hard time focusing near and far. This doesn't save ink but can make your reading directions more enjoyable. If a larger point size means I'll wrap to another page,  sometimes I'll opt to squint. <s>) <br/>
<br/>
You can break the paragraphs or close them up as you prefer, too, in a word processor, ...or boldface, or underscore...  whatever will make clues easiest for you.  It might seem unnecessary, but sometimes I'll edit quite a bit before I print rather than try to make sense of a run-on on the trail. <br/>
<br/>
If the placer has used a lot of "degrees" instead of  you can use your replace option to change every one in the document at once.  Same goes for feet ( ' or ft.), paces, (p) directions like northwest to NW, etc.  If there are a lot of "degrees" changed to  it can mean a big difference in your line wrap and page length, ultimately.<br/>
<br/>
I'll sometimes use the fast option to print the clues straight from the website and fly out the door. This was the usual modus when boxing with Betz because she is spontaneous.  And I often run late. But I have found that just taking the time to read clues through from beginning to end in my own document has helped me be better prepared.  If I take the time to make a document, I save it.  Just do.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and if you like to print right from the web, you might want to get rid of those headers and footers using your page set-up options.  They waste ink, too, I think.<br/>
<br/>
And that little tip about not changing your cartridge just because it nags you is a good idea.  I have a 3-in-1 HP and it told me over a week ago that my cartridge was almost empty.  I think I've printed a half ream since. No foolin'.<br/>
<br/>
YMMV<br/>
<br/>
I have only bought real HP cartidges from the store, but I think BJs multi-paks are a savings over other stores.  You don't have to shop for a sale somewhere.<br/>

    I've been reading all these tips about saving ink and was <br/>
surprised that no one mentioned refilling the cartridges. I bought one <br/>
of those refill kits at walmart for $13 and it refills 5 cartridges <br/>
that's less than $3 a cartridge and it's really easy to do, trust me <br/>
on this, I did it no problem.<br/>
   Also if you hit print view at the top of the clue and then <br/>
hightlite only the part of the clue that you want to print, then when <br/>
you go to the print box change the all button to select and it will <br/>
print out only what you have highlited.<br/>
