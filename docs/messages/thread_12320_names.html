I picked Irish Tinker which is an Irish Gypsy because I am 100o/o Irish<br/>
American and I like to wander around in the outdoors like a gypsy.<br/>
My sister picked Odillio because my daughter started calling her that when<br/>
she was learning to talk.<br/>
My husband picked French Fox but just changed it to Freedom Fox because of<br/>
his new patriotic stamp. The Fox part comes from his real name, Todd which<br/>
means Fox.<br/>
My three year old goes by Ladybug98 because she loves anything with ladybugs<br/>
on it.<br/>
My three year old goes by Rosie Bunny because when we went to pick out<br/>
stamps she really wanted a bunny stamp and her nick name  has been Rosie<br/>
since birth.<br/>

I prefer the easy clues also especially since we're new at it! But I mostly<br/>
enjoy letterboxing because it's a great activity to do with my boys and we<br/>
all have fun hunting down boxes together and we love to be outdoors!  I<br/>
don't want to have to struggle with clues...I want it to just be fun!<br/>
<br/>
But I do bow to those who can puzzle out the really difficult clues and<br/>
solve them!  :)<br/>
