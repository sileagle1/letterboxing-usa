I will tell you as a dental assistant, altoids will rot your teeth...worse <br/>
than any candy we have ever seen. Yes, I know off topic, but I feel a civic <br/>
responsibilty to preface any altoid discussion with that. I don't know if <br/>
there is a way to waterproof them however, washing them in bleach will cause <br/>
them to rust. I think I remember someone mentioning coating the inside with <br/>
clear nailpolish. However, unless they are protected from the elements I <br/>
can't imagine they would l hold up well.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents......<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple of ideas:<br/>
<br/>
1) Try placing a piece of plastic inside the tin so that it over hangs the edges<br/>
of the lid.  This might provide enough of a seal.  Try this and drop it into a<br/>
bowl of water overnight and see what happens.  If this works, you would have to<br/>
trust that the finders would put the plastic back into place when they are done<br/>
with it.  I suppose duct tape around the lip of the lid might also provide a seal.<br/>
<br/>
2)  Don't use if someplace where it will be exposed to water.  I have seen small<br/>
tins that weren't waterproof that were magnetically stuck to the underside of<br/>
various objects.  Wedge it into a rock face high enough that the water level<br/>
won't reach it and it is protected from water coming from above.<br/>

I'm no help for the waterproofing, but as for the<br/>
smell, give vinegar a try. Vinegar can be used to take<br/>
out the smell of urine, so maybe it can handle this,<br/>
too. <br/>
