&gt; Stupid Orcs. Stupid Ring. Stupid Quest.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Just back from my 11th trip through Middle Earth: the Orcs aren't <br/>
really stupid per se, rather slaves of evil. Gandalf pitied them, <br/>
though he slew them mightily. The Ring is inanimate, or was, until it <br/>
became inflammable, but it wasn't insensible except in its magnetic <br/>
attraction to a certain Hand. The Quest, now, the Quest was certainly <br/>
stupid. Noble stupidity; a parable for the writers' own time and an <br/>
apt similie for certain struggles in this age; staggering in its <br/>
inherent beauty and incomprehensible in the imagining, but granted; <br/>
stupid. Thank Goodness it ended with a traitor's fatal mistake.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Mike, couldn't resist...Jay<br/>
