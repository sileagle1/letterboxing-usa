AZ89a is Ron Golden, a west coast Letterboxer. He hasn't been very <br/>
active for the last year or so. The "Fake" rock pictured was hand <br/>
made. Ron is a very talented guy. We had another west coast <br/>
letterboxer that made "Fake" rocks for many of his plants(Sir <br/>
Balthizar)(spelling?)and he too has dropped out of letterboxing. Now <br/>
somewhere Sir B posted a file, possibly at LbNCA, on how to make such <br/>
rocks. So if you are diligent and are successful in locating the <br/>
recipe please post it for everyone to see as the fake rocks I've tried <br/>
to make look very fake.<br/>

It's called Amaco Sculptamold Modeling Compound. As I recall, Sir B. molded  <br/>
it around small Sterilite containers he bought at the dollar store. It seems <br/>
to  me that he painted his rocks after they were dry.<br/>

But I suppose with some shaping it can be done.<br/>
<br/>
I used a tupperware box and covered the thing with QuickCrete that i  <br/>
bought at HomeDepot for $5.00.  The trick is the box can't be too big  <br/>
or the concrete is just to heavy and breaks under its own weight. So  <br/>
use a small box. Than you have to sit with the mush of concrete and  <br/>
push the concrete around as it sets to shape it, otherwise it looks  <br/>
like a piece of gray poo.<br/>
<br/>
I was using a popsicle stick to create crevices and little  <br/>
irregularities.<br/>
<br/>
Than I bought a can of that faux stone spray paint ($11) and sprayed  <br/>
the whole concrete. For the final touch, I rubbed dirt and mud on it  <br/>
from the planting site to disguise it.<br/>
<br/>
I had this fake rock planted at a playground for about 8 months.  <br/>
Undisturbed. But somehow, one day, a kid found it and destroyed it  <br/>
maliciously. Luckily a neighbor in that area who had found it  <br/>
letterboxing found the culprits and beat them up . . . oh no . . . no  <br/>
she didn't do that . . . she rescued the box from them and contacted  <br/>
me. . . then I beat them up . . .<br/>

I think perhaps getting some styrofoam and painting them with <br/>
some sort of paint may work (though many would simply dissolve the<br/>
styrofoam)It did remind me of 'Hollywood' type rocks.<br/>
