This is a Geocache/letterbox that is neat. We done this one a week<br/>
ago. We are waiting on Sith Impossible 2 to come out. I am<br/>
sure you would like the idea of how this was done.  10 boxes with<br/>
a 11th box that had the trinkets in it.  The 10 boxes have word stamps<br/>
that you stamp on a sheet. After you get all 10 boxes, the stamps will <br/>
become the written clue's you'll need to find the 11th box.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Idea's goes, If there was a Letterbox of the year award, I would <br/>
give it to this one; hands down.  Very fun.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I then switched over to geocaching, but without<br/>
&gt; &gt; using GPS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You know, there's not actually a rule saying that letterboxing clues<br/>
&gt;can't use GPS coordinates.  Kind of a geocache without the junk!  =)<br/>
&gt;Some letterboxers without a GPS might be disappointed not having the<br/>
&gt;tools necessary to find it, but then not every letterbox is for<br/>
&gt;everyone.  Just ask anyone who has cursed my name while hiking up<br/>
&gt;some large mountain to get a box of mine.  ;o)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'd be thrilled to death if we could convince geocachers to just give<br/>
&gt;up the junk and switch to stamps.  I'd become a geocacher in no time<br/>
&gt;flat!<br/>
