                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was out and about solo this weekend (Rustypuff had to work) and <br/>
found the following boxes in good shape (unless otherwise noted):<br/>
<br/>
*Bald Eagle<br/>
*Case of the Missing Mascot<br/>
*Conanicut Cannons<br/>
*Island Sanctuary (The ink pad in this box was a crimson mess.  I <br/>
cleaned it up pretty well, but the same can't be said for my fingers <br/>
and hands.  Anyone seeing me exit the sactuary could well be excused <br/>
for imagining I had just murdered someone)<br/>
*Scituate Puzzle (4)<br/>
*Square in the Middle (225 degrees should be 295 degrees, if memory <br/>
serves me)<br/>
*The Warrior<br/>
*Weezil series (3)<br/>
<br/>
I also found one mystery box and checked on another.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up the Hairless Troll HH at Conanicut Cannons.  Where will I <br/>
take him next?  Connecticut?  Kansas?  Cape Cod?  Well, probably not <br/>
to any of those places as his hair is apparently lurking somewhere <br/>
more local.  If there is any hope for a successful transplant, he <br/>
will have to be placed somewhere in Rhode Island.<br/>
<br/>
See y'all in CT!<br/>
