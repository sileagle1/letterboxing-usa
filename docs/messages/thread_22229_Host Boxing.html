                    <div class="plaintext-content">For us, the high cost of travel restricts our letterboxing to day<br/>
trips.  We'd love to get elsewhere to letterbox, but the cost of<br/>
staying over is prohibitive for us retirees.  Is that true for you,<br/>
too?  If so, perhaps we could help one another as host boxers.  A host<br/>
boxer would be someone who has an extra bedroom in their home and is<br/>
willing to make that available at no cost to other boxers from away. <br/>
<br/>
We have one room with a double bed and would be willing to make that<br/>
available during the summer.  We winter elsewhere in smaller quarters<br/>
but can manage guests who don't mind sleeping on a pull-out couch<br/>
in the living room.<br/>
<br/>
There would have to be some stipulations for both guests and hosts. <br/>
For example, a host would be expected to allow the guest to have a key<br/>
to the house, would provide a bed(s) but not necessarily bedding;<br/>
shared or private bath; refrigerator space including freezer space for<br/>
cooler ice packs; and car-parking space.  Children might or might not<br/>
be welcome.  In our situation, kids are great but our house really is<br/>
not suitable for small children.<br/>
<br/>
There are risks involved, of course, and these could be reduced by<br/>
some stipulations for participating in such a program.  For example, I<br/>
suggest that potential guests be restricted to people who can, and are<br/>
willing, to also be hosts.  That is based on the belief that a<br/>
home-owner is generally a good and safe citizen, demonstrating the<br/>
ability of handling adult responsibility through home-ownership.  Yes,<br/>
I know that some pretty weird people can and do own homes, but in<br/>
general<br/>
<br/>
Guests would be expected to use such an opportunity strictly to aid<br/>
them in letterboxing, i.e. they are not guests that hang out and do<br/>
not expect to be entertained. Guests would be expected to come and go<br/>
at reasonable hours, take care of their meals on their own, not<br/>
expecting kitchen privileges other than refrigeration unless clearly<br/>
agreed upon or offered by a host.  Guests would have to agree not to<br/>
hold a host liable for any accident, so that if a guest falls down the<br/>
stairs, a host doesn't have to worry that s/he will be sued.  On<br/>
the other hand, should a guest break something, the guest would be<br/>
expected to cover repair or replacement costs.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you would be interested in experimenting with host/guest<br/>
boxing, please be in touch.  My wife and I live in central MA, about<br/>
20 miles northwest of Boston.  As potential guests, we would be<br/>
particularly interested in hosts located within a half day's travel<br/>
from our home. That would cover elsewhere in New England and the state<br/>
of New York. However, longer journeys are not to be ruled out.<br/>

You might check out www.couchsurfing.com<br/>
<br/>
It's basically a way of free or nearly free places to stay from people<br/>
who'll open their homes to visitors. It's not letterboxing oriented,<br/>
but it might provide you more options than simply trying to find other<br/>
letterboxers whose place you can "couch surf".<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I'll even set up a new message board on Atlas Quest for couch<br/>
surfing requests. =) So if you have somewhere you'd like to travel and<br/>
have a free or very cheap place to stay, people can post to it and<br/>
say, "HEY! Can anyone make room for me?!"<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I like that idea.... =)<br/>

Another option is www.servas.org<br/>
<br/>
Same 'couch surfing' concept but expanded to a global level.  We <br/>
haven't done this personally but intend to once we 'settle' down in a <br/>
decade or two.  We do have some friends who've participated both as <br/>
hosts and travellers and they LOVED it!  I've been trying to figure out <br/>
how to combine letterboxing with Servas for a while now.  Looks like AQ <br/>
may fulfill that dream.  ;)<br/>

I'll have to check that out, but www.couchsurfing.com does support<br/>
couch surfing on a global level as well. (I even checked it for places<br/>
in Panama before Amanda and I went, but there was only one really<br/>
weird guy offering a couch in that country so we chose not to persue<br/>
it!) I know it hasn't been around for more than a few years, however,<br/>
so servas.org might have a larger population base to work with if it's<br/>
been around longer.<br/>

Servas Intl. is an NGO, been around since 1949, even represented at <br/>
the UN. Now, if folks involved with Servas got wind of letterboxing, <br/>
there'd be boxes in some really cool places and I wouldn't have to <br/>
resort to geocaching when we go boondock-hopping!  ;)<br/>
