Thanks much for the reply. I don't know if a logbook has been placed <br/>
at Abrams Falls. I hope you get up there to check on them.  It is a <br/>
beautiful park!! However, please don't be too disappointed if they <br/>
are not there. It appears letterboxes and geocaches are being removed <br/>
from at least some National Parks. I would like to know their status <br/>
if you remain inspired to check on them. Thanks again.<br/>
