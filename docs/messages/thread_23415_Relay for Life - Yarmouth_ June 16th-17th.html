Relay for Life at Dennis-Yarmouth Regional High School.  The boxes<br/>
will be available June 16th until 10 pm and available until 2 pm on<br/>

<br/>
Clues will be posted closer to the event.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are unable to come, but would still like to see the stamps, I<br/>
will send them to anyone who makes a donation.  Please visit<br/>

There will be 8 "gifts" available only until 10 pm on the 16th and<br/>

One of the gifts will be available if you make a donation to the<br/>
American Cancer Society.  If you are unable to attend, but would like<br/>
the stamp images, please make a donation at the link below and send me<br/>
your address and I will send the stamp images (as soon as I carve that<br/>
last one.)<br/>
