<br/>
Is there anyone out there looking for someone to letterbox with in RI <br/>
&amp; SE CT?  I do about 90% of my letterboxing alone &amp; would love <br/>
someone to hike with.  I have forsaken all my AMC hiking buddies for <br/>
letterboxing LOL.  I am usually available weeknights after 4:30 &amp; <br/>
weekends, although April is a pretty hectic month for me.  If you are <br/>
interested email me at moonstone_baby@yahoo.com.  <br/>
<br/>
happy trails,<br/>

<br/>
AMC hiking buddies, huh.  Gee, I don't know if I would<br/>
be able to keep up with you ;o).<br/>
<br/>
Actually, though, I am in the same boat as you and do<br/>
most of my LBing alone.  When my best friend was up a<br/>
few weeks ago I realized how much more fun it is with<br/>
two.<br/>
<br/>
So, let me know, and I would love to hook up with you<br/>
for some hikes.  I live over in Bristol, and<br/>
weeknights are a bit hard for me because of work, but<br/>
I have Friday and the weekends off.  I generally try<br/>
to get out at one day in the weekend (though I haven't<br/>
been very good at it lately).<br/>
<br/>
Let me know (and I am going to try to sneak out of<br/>
work for the day Trish emailed us about.)<br/>
