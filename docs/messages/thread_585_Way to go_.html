You're not the only one who's had trouble finding our website.  I've <br/>
submitted it three times to all the major search engines, to no avail.  To <br/>
make matters worse, there is still a long-forgotten page called Letterboxing <br/>
USA floating around out there that is not being updated with new clues (but <br/>
it DOES show up on the search engines)<br/>
<br/>
It's probably a good idea to remind everyone from time to time that our <br/>
current website is called Letterboxing North America.  As Thom points out, <br/>
the main page can presently be found at <br/>
http://members.aol.com/catsdice/lbna/clues<br/>
<br/>
Depending on various logistics and technical issues, however, this could <br/>
someday change again.  The safest bet is to send people to<br/>
  www.letterboxing.org<br/>

Be sure to let Tom Cooch and I know when you are travelling thru VT (do<br/>
you have a specific date yet?) - we both love to get together!<br/>

ps - by then, I <promise> to have some swimmer's letterboxes out, (altho<br/>

I agree with Mitch - it is what I always tell people, as it is easy for<br/>
them (and for me) to remember.  Which is why we got it in the first<br/>
place.<br/>

happening down here. Thanks for all the new boxes, it's good to not be the <br/>
only one anymore. <br/>
For those of you in areas where it seems like there are no other <br/>
letterboxers, I would like to encourage you to start hiding boxes like crazy. <br/>
It is just as challenging to hide them as it is to find them and just as much <br/>
fun.  It is true that if you hide enough then others will show up. And when <br/>
they do it will be your boxes they are finding and you will get lots of <br/>
wonderful feedback. So be the johnny appleseed of your area and plant those <br/>
stamps. It is worth it.<br/>
