                    <div class="plaintext-content">A very big thank you from the lazy letterboxer and the letterboxing ham to the wonderful California letterboxers who met with us on Sunday. Doublesaj and Old Blue, Mimulus, Vicki and Paul from SF (who couldn't stay long but impressed us not only with his carving skills but also with his ability to make balloon hats, how cool is that?!) are just the greatest. We had a blast boxing together and sharing more than a few laughs. This is one of the best bonuses that letterboxing has to offer...not only do you get to check out beautiful new places when you travel but you get to meet fantastic, caring and talented people as well. Now our only hope is that we get to reciprocate next time they're on the east coast. <br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
Deanne (aka Luvvy) &amp; Dave <br/>
