I haven't read all of my e-mail yet, but I am seeing<br/>
many messages with subject line "Virus" and "Sorry I<br/>
didn't know I had a virus."  Can anyone tell me which<br/>
messages are safe to read???<br/>

Thank you for your reply to my very paranoid question.<br/>
(I have had some bad experiences with viruses in the<br/>
past, so I hope you will excuse my paranoia!) I did<br/>
get a little braver after thinking it over, and read<br/>
the messages, but fortunately did not open any<br/>
attachments.<br/>

..and attachments are the #1 carrier. Many of the recent virus that have<br/>
come on the scene were causing great harm before the anti-virus people had a<br/>
solution availble. I have no problem but newbies become quick and easy<br/>
victims. Removing attachments will all but eliminate infection. I have been<br/>
on the net far too many years to admit to (HINT: I used pine and elm ) and<br/>
have caught one virus. It was in an attachment.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am against stopping people from sending messages with attachments.<br/>
<br/>
Your opinion goes against the way most lists operate but that is neither<br/>
here nor there. The real issue is purpose could an attachment serve on this<br/>
list? This is a TEXT list and there is no reason or purpose that I can<br/>
imagine that one needs to use attachments to communicate on this list. Help<br/>
me out here, why do we need attachments? Why not eliminate that one risk?<br/>

I have to agree with this sentiment. Nowadays, viruses can come from <br/>
friends and relatives, without them knowing it. Most lists I've seen don't <br/>
allow attachments. A common sense precaution for safety.<br/>
