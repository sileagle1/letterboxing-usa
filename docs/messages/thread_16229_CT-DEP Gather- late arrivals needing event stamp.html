put a damper on things- especially the stuff on the table.  We picked <br/>
everything up, including the event stamp.  I've heard through the <br/>
grapevine that "Hello from Joe" is one of those who didn't get the <br/>
stamp even though they were there.  Anyone in the same boat can <br/>
contact me at:  njks919@aol.com   I'd be glad to put a copy in the <br/>
snail mail to you if you just send me your address.--thanks!-<br/>
