Message from Mohmers:<br/>
  Hi Rosewood, Butterfly and Yin Yang;<br/>
 I took the neighbor kids there about two weeks ago.  The Turtle Park <br/>
Letterbox was still there then.  It is possible that it disappeared since <br/>
though.  Thanks for the update.  Did you look in the evergreen trees <br/>
mentioned in the clues?  The last time we were there it was staring us in the <br/>
face for a while before the girls saw it (And even I didn't see it right away <br/>
and I helped my son plant it).<br/>
  If you are in the neighborhood again and want to give it another try, write <br/>
me a note and I'll try to give you a few more hints.<br/>
  Did you have time to locate the other boxes planted in Forest Park?<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>

Hi!<br/>
The kids and I tried again for the Turtle Park LB on 8/20 and found it.  <br/>
Also, we found the Rock Wood Letterbox on 8/12.  Next, we are probably going <br/>
to head into the zoo!<br/>

Thanks!    Rockwoods is a neat park.  They offer several activities for <br/>
kids...Mine have attended orienteering classes, a cave crawl and Maple syrup <br/>
tapping activites there.  Glad you enjoyed it.  :o)<br/>
