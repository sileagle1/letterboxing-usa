                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings, everyone!   If any of you have had enough snow and want to come to <br/>
Florida for a letterboxing gathering, don't forget, the Fabulous Flamingo <br/>
Fiesta is coming up weekend after next (February 5).<br/>
<br/>
I've sent directions to some of those who've expressed an interest, and I <br/>
posted them on the Letterboxing Southeast board on Atlasquest.<br/>
<br/>
In order to not   bore those of you who aren't interested, I'll just say, <br/>
check Atlasquest, if you need directions, or feel free to email me at StDebb at <br/>
aol dot com, and I'll send them right to you.   (I can even scan a park map and <br/>
email it to you, if you want.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, last call for traveling event stamps!   If anyone wants their event <br/>
stamp to visit us, email me, and I'll give you the address.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time and attention and we now return you to your life, <br/>
already in progress.<br/>
<br/>
