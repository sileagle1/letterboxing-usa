<h2>Who</h2>
<p>Planted 10/29/02<br/>Planted By: Leader of the 
Pack<br/>Rated : Easy Drive up : and Thank -You to Team Maddawg</p>
<p>Winton Woods Park on Winton Rd. off Rte 275 in 
Cincinnati, Ohio</p>
<p>Who: We travel to the National FFA Convention in 
Louisville , Kentucky going to celebrate and cheer for Pink Trotters who is 
Connecticut's National Officer Candidate. The FFA is a National Youth 
Organization of over 450,000 members. These kids are the cream of the crop in 
our nation. All working in Supervised Agricultural Experiences as part of a 
school curriculum. Agriculture encompasses the equine industry, landscaping, 
pre-vet, floriculture, aquaculture, forestry and so much more! Not just cows and 
plows. Students in the Agriculture Education program are taught by advisors, 
career preparation , classroom work and life skills shared through their 
experience. The owl is the symbol of the FFA leadership. They are the WHO that 
makes a difference in the lives of the members, we thank them in part by 
honoring them with this letterbox.</p>
<p>Enter the Winton Woods Park and pass the ranger 
station. Proceed to the Kingfisher trail and park opposite the trail head. Look 
for the "Wetland Restoration" sign. Take 28 steps down the tar path. Look to the 
left for a multi-trunked tree. The letterbox Who is tucked in behind it. Stamp, 
re-seal tightly and hide again in the same place.</p>
