                    <div class="plaintext-content">On May 17, 2002 Funhog placed Las Palabras Viejas Letterbox near <br/>
Espanola, in Rio Arriba County, New Mexico. This letterbox is only a <br/>
mile and a half off the main highway between Santa Fe and Taos. It's a <br/>
quick stop and a chance to slow down for a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: Just south of Velarde on Route 68 turn west on Route <br/>
582 toward Lyden. There is a sign at this junction. Soon after you <br/>
cross the river, turn right onto Route 59. Shortly, you will come to a <br/>
riverside park which appeared to be abandoned when I was here. Exactly <br/>
.2 mile past the gate to this park the road gets slightly wider. There <br/>
is JUST enough room for a car to pull off to the right and park.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: Walk about 50 yards farther down the road to a wash <br/>
filled with dark volcanic rocks. Scramble uphill to a gigantic flat <br/>
faced messenger gazing at the river below. To the left of this landmark <br/>
is a short row of shady sentinels. The letterbox waits beneath a large <br/>
rock leaning against one of these neighbors.<br/>
