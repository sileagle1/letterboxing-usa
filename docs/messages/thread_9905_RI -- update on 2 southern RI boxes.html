letterboxes, Polly's Rock Quest in South Kingstown and the 4th Rhody <br/>
Runaround box in Charlestown. Both boxes are where they belong &amp; are <br/>
in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
I also "found" the hitchhiker, Thumbs Up, in my friend Susan's living <br/>
room.  She has had the hitchhiker for several months but has not been <br/>
able to get out anywhere to leave it.  She felt bad about hanging on <br/>
to it for so long so I offered to help her out by taking it off her <br/>
hands &amp; moving it along.  I hope to get Thumbs Up back out on the <br/>
trail in the next few days.<br/>
