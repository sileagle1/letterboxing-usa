I will be in the ELK/Ft. Bragg area the week after Easter. I would <br/>
appreciate any local advice on what boxes are intact and nearby <br/>
for some trail fun.<br/>
I will be there with non-boxers, but that never stops me from <br/>
getting up early to hike/box before the crew is up!<br/>
Contact me off line; maybe we can meet up!<br/>

area but Old Blue and I planted a nifty series of 5 boxes plus another one!! <br/>
Check out "The St. Patrick Series" and "Gift in the Redwoods". Your friends <br/>
don't' have to be letterboxers to love this series as it will take them to the <br/>
greatest points on the northern coast between just north of Ft. Bragg and just <br/>
south of Mendocino. The added bonus will be that you just might be first <br/>
finders and latch on to a surprise or two in the process!!<br/>
<br/>
Tell me how you did when you get back<br/>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br/>
but good impressions. Sir B<br/>
