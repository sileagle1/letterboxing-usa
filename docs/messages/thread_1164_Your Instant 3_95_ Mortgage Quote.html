<br/>
We have government guaranteed loans from Veteran's Administration and FHA available at competitive rates. And if you haven't found that "Special" home yet, our network of Affiliated Brokers can help you find it!  Whether you need a starter home or a fixer upper, or a move-up into that next level home, or a mansion, or a ranch, a farm, land, investment properties, and even commercial, our network brokers can help you find it now!  <br/>
<br/>
We feature many, many loan programs for folks with damaged credit where your interest rate is not out of sight. Like 85% LTV mortgages with 1 year bankruptcy discharge. Re-establish mortgages up to 85% with bank statements and pay-stubs.  Stated income loans up to 90% with no mortgage insurance. <br/>
<br/>
In most cases, we can improve upon your current interest rate and loan terms, and we pledge to give you a prompt response.<br/>
<br/>
Best of all, we offer fast, fast loan processing and closing. We use the speed of the Internet to leverage your loan processing. But all of this does not happen, unless you go to http://loanyes.da.ru and complete the online loan application.<br/>
