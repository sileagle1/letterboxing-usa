                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just returned from a (mostly) fruitful trip to Washington DC where <br/>
we picked up 10 boxes.  The boxes we found in good order were:the <br/>
Ram, Inventor, Independence, Mr Jefferson's Box, Taft Memorial, Skull <br/>
&amp; Bones, Orion, and It's a Holiday.  We also came across the Columbia <br/>
HH, but we left it there to continue it's travels rather than return <br/>
it to CT.  We did not find Teddy's Box- too much snow and mud to <br/>
really look.  We also missed the Egypt Explorer, but I think we were <br/>
in the wrong place for that one.  I must say that urban boxing is <br/>
VERY different than what we are accustomed to.  It takes a whole <br/>
different set of skills.  A lot of fun, but we're glad to be home!<br/>
Thank you so much to Scarab of the Doubtful Guests!  We had a <br/>
wonderful lunch talking about boxing.  It's always great to meet <br/>
other boxers.  It's nice to know we're not the only crazy people out <br/>
there.  Maybe we should set up a support group for LB addicts!<br/>
OK, so I'm a little tired from the 8 hour drive.  Anyway, we had a <br/>
great time, so thank you all of the planters down in DC!<br/>
