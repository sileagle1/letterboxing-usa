                    <div class="plaintext-content">Much of it is condensation. Also, rubbermaid style containers <br/>
generally weren't designed for outdoor use. Although in the <br/>
refrigerator and freezer they hold up a good seal, outdoors you have <br/>
constant temperature swings. Each time as the plastic shrinks or <br/>
swells, moisture is allowed in. As far as plastic containers go, the <br/>
high-end containers hold up better than your cheap dollar store <br/>
variety do. They're usually thicker and have a more secure seal.<br/>
<br/>
Metal ammo boxes usually do an excellent job of keeping things dry. <br/>
Their major downfalls though include they can be pricey depending on <br/>
where you are and in urban areas, they can set off a "bomb scare" <br/>
(Even though a bomb could just as easily be in a plastic container.).<br/>

With bigger boxes our solution has been baggies, baggies and more<br/>
baggies.  We've found standing water in boxes that were closed<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fiddling around with the tubes I found that using thinner material<br/>
like PZKut lets me get away with a larger stamp (relatively speaking)<br/>
of about 1 1/2" Long x 3/4"+ Wide.  Not a big stamp to be sure, but<br/>
not the smallest either.  With careful trimming of the stamp edges<br/>
(esp. width), and putting it in first so that it rests in the pointy<br/>
end of the tube, there's a little more room for a wider logbook. <br/>
Maybe it should be called logroll??? <g> <br/>
<br/>
The biggest drawback is if it sees a lot of traffic, then the logbook<br/>
will need changing more often.  I keep a ready supply in my backpack<br/>
now just in case.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest advantage is that they are so much easier to hide &amp;<br/>
disguise than larger boxes...therefore harder for vandals to stumble<br/>
upon.  Plus the logbook will take the visitors regular size stamp image.<br/>
<br/>
But then every container has its good points and bad points, one might<br/>
find a HH snuggled inside rubbermaid...or tucked next to a centrifuge<br/>
tube!   <br/>

I've been thinking of experimenting with this concept.  Those <br/>
commercial dessicants usually contain silica crystals.  These are now <br/>
available as 'crystal' cat litter.  You can get about a gallon jug of <br/>
the stuff for $7 or so.  Then it's just a matter of coming up with <br/>
some sort of little bag to put them in....<br/>

Sorry, folks, it's on the frequently misspelled words list, along with "misspelled" and I have a spelling-bee-er in my household!  Now, with that out of the way, I have to say I really don't like those Rubbermaid containers.  I've found about 2 dry ones in 6 months of letterboxing, and many with chewed holes.  They're just too thin and don't seal well.  I remember someone listing a website on here, maybe 3-5 months ago, with some kind of science tubes or earth tubes or geo-tubes or something to that effect. They were made for being outside.  I think they were thicker plastic, maybe w/ screw-on lids? And were bigger in diameter than centrifuge tubes you're describing.  Maybe I dreamed the whole thing as my ideal letterbox. I saved the post... will see if I can find it &amp; keep you posted!  --lunaryakketyact<br/>

Rubbermaid makes all kinds of containers, the ones with the white lids<br/>
always have water in them....Correction, WE always run across the ones<br/>
with water in them.  The rubbermaid with the blue ring around the seal<br/>
sometimes leak (found one- mine), but so far our experience is that<br/>
they have the best track record for being watertight.  I'm guessing<br/>
the disposable gladware things probably wouldn't last very long since<br/>
they don't have a good seal and they're thin.  <br/>

You're not dreaming, it was me and my beloved little centrifuge tubes.<br/>
 Boil them, freeze them, they don't care.  They're a little over 4<br/>
1/2" long (outside) and a little over 1" wide (on the inside).<br/>

  Well I've got 50 of 'em that I keep forgetting to use!<br/>
  I am doing major maintenance this weekend on all of my<br/>
  boxes anywhere near the Delaware River as I heard my<br/>
  Tinicum Box next to the canal washed away. I'm going<br/>
  loaded with paper towels, new baggies and hopefully<br/>
  I'll remember the dessicants!<br/>

I haven't used them yet since I wound up turning my first urban box into a mini, but they seem very sturdy. The top of  the container goes up into a pretty deep groove on the lid and then the lip of the lid, formed by the groove goes pretty far down onto the top of the container. And the top of the container has a slanted lip on it also, that meets the slanted bottom of the lid. This is probably about as clear as mud, but they seem like they would work very well. <br/>

I'm new to letterboxing but am having a wonderful time with this new <br/>
hobby.  I had a discussion recently about the moisture topic, <br/>
prompted by find a box where the insides were damp, not soaked.  The <br/>
individual I was talking to suggested carring silica gel packets to <br/>
place in the boxes, you know, the ones you get in with your new shoes <br/>
that say 'do not eat'.  He felt that might help with the moisture <br/>
problem.  Has anyone tried these?  They are not very expensive and <br/>
may help with damage.  Let me know your thoughts.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Much of it is condensation. Also, rubbermaid style containers <br/>
&gt; generally weren't designed for outdoor use. Although in the <br/>
&gt; refrigerator and freezer they hold up a good seal, outdoors you <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; constant temperature swings. Each time as the plastic shrinks or <br/>
&gt; swells, moisture is allowed in. As far as plastic containers go, <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; high-end containers hold up better than your cheap dollar store <br/>
&gt; variety do. They're usually thicker and have a more secure seal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Metal ammo boxes usually do an excellent job of keeping things dry. <br/>
&gt; Their major downfalls though include they can be pricey depending <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; where you are and in urban areas, they can set off a "bomb scare" <br/>
&gt; (Even though a bomb could just as easily be in a plastic <br/>
container.).<br/>
