  Subject: [LbNA] RI - Update on missing Kurdziel boxes<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  In the last month I have had several boxes go missing.  I have been <br/>
  busy recarving, etc. and have most of the boxes sitting in my car <br/>
  awaiting replacement.  I thought it would be worth an update since <br/>
  several people have emailed me directly.  Of course we are leaving <br/>
  for vacation soon so it may be a while...  Please let me know <br/>
  offline if there are other boxes of ours that need replacement or <br/>
  repair.<br/>
