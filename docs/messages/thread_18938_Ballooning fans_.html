<br/>
Any boxers out there attending the Freedom Weekend Aloft festival <br/>
this weekend in Anderson SC?<br/>
<br/>
I'll be there for four days, Friday through Monday as part of the <br/>
celebration.  Although there is a parking fee, there are goodies to <br/>
be had for free there.  I'd enjoy doing an exchange as well with <br/>
anyone visiting.  I always did think hot air balloons would be fun <br/>
to carve on a stamp!<br/>
<br/>
For more information you can email me directly at <br/>
greycrazy1@yahoo.com before tomorrow (Thursday) night.<br/>
