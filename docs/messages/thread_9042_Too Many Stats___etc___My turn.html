I am so confused.....I read all these and shake my head.  Since when <br/>
is it wrong for anyone to do things a little differntly?  Some of us <br/>
LOVE the silly stats...Some of us NEVER keep stats at all...(me) who <br/>
really cares?  This is an area we can all have our own personality <br/>
without fear of admonishment. Least I thought. I have read every <br/>
differnt kind of post in bilwilderment.  Threats? over boxes? huh? <br/>
seems extreme....Clicks (forgive my spelling, guess what, i am not <br/>
sure if I care what you think of it!! oh oh!)  i do not think there <br/>
are clicks, as much as groups of people who live near each other, who <br/>
would have NEVER met if it were not for this 'sport'.  I do 'sport' <br/>
as it is a fun hobby for some...hard core sport for others, guess <br/>
what, not a bad thing.  How neat that people can meet and expand <br/>
their worlds with new folk. Esp in this day and age, where you meet <br/>
people at work, or well...church if that is your inclination. So, not <br/>
many places to meet folks these days.  If you are in an area without <br/>
many boxers, i am sorry. Or come to meet and greets, some people <br/>
travel far for those...and you know, all are welcome.<br/>
<br/>
So, i am really confused at all the venom, and attacks over silly <br/>
things. (silly to me) why pick one persons stats, post them and then <br/>
turn it into strings of condemnation and judgement? I just don't get <br/>
it.  So, for those who enjoy real/silly/no stats...box on!<br/>
<br/>
For those who need to meet new folks, come to a meet and greet.  <br/>
<br/>
For those who feel this has become to serious, lighten up and laugh.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I wait for blasts, flames and other reprecutions from <br/>
my ...opinions.<br/>
<br/>
Cat....ADG #2..the one who is everyone's figment....<br/>
<br/>
Opionins expressed by this ADG does not represent all the gang!  Nor <br/>
does the spelling errors...Tammy..sorry I spell like Sarah! :)<br/>
