                    <div class="plaintext-content">Had a lovely weekend and managed to plant a new box series near Island Park<br/>
at Big Springs.  This is very close to Yellowstone's West Gate if you are<br/>
going that direction.<br/>
<br/>
We had a nice hike (I took two friends/coworkers along who thought it would<br/>
be fun to bring their grandkids back to hunt out the clues-possible future<br/>
LBers?)  We explored the area, then went down to Mesa Falls, which is always<br/>
beautiful.  We then followed Warm River and pulled over and actually picked<br/>
some watercress for a salad that was growing wild in the riverbed. I had no<br/>
idea it grew here.<br/>
<br/>
While we were at the springs we saw a large amount of wildlife, some of the<br/>
more fun spots were a blue heron, a flock of pelicans, an eagle, an osprey,<br/>
a trumpeter swan, geese, marmuts, trout and evidence of moose and beaver.<br/>
<br/>
All in all this was a lovely day.  I just love where I live, and<br/>
letterboxing gives me another excuse to get out and enjoy it! <br/>
