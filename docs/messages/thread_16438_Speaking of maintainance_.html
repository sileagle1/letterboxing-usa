My maintainance is often done by taking a box home with me, cleaning <br/>
it up, cleaning the stamp, maybe changing out the logbook, <br/>
relabeling, etc.  I will pick it up in the evening and replace it the <br/>
next morning, leaving a note in a box in the same spot JUST IN CASE <br/>
some nocturnal letterboxer goes seeking they will know that they are <br/>
in the right spot and what time the box should be replaced by.<br/>
<br/>
So I decided to carve an "Out for maintainance" stamp for that <br/>
replacement box.  Since it will only ever be out for a night here or <br/>
there on fairly infrequent occasions, I doubt anyone will ever find <br/>
it, but if they do it is an extra stamp, rather than a disappointment.<br/>
<br/>
And, it was a fun thing to carve today.<br/>
