                    <html><body>We are so very addicted!  What a day!
<br/>Today we added two new letterboxes to the world...found two, picked up a hitchhiker  and discovered one missing....(we think).
<br/>
<br/>Box 1.
<br/>
<br/>Location:  Southeastern, Virginia -- Norfolk, VA

<br/>Hermitage Foundation Museum grounds
<br/>
<br/>Off of Hampton Blvd. in Norfolk, and down Northshore Road, you'll find the Hermitage Foundation Museum...one of the prettiest places in Norfolk.  As you are driving along Northshore Rd. you will skirt the water lined with rocks...look closely into the woods...there's a special "lighthouse" looking building nestled in the trees...it's a lovely site to see before you get to the grounds.  On the grounds somewhere--don't worry it's not a lot of ground to cover--you'll find a cobblestone path...along this path you will find a backwards brick bench...it looks like a little brick wall from the path...but closer inspection shows you it is something that can be sat upon.  Here as you sit...you will find seven little rounded bushes.  Hermitage's Hermit...dwells inside of one of these bushes.  Even if you don't make it to the inside of this unusual Museum the grounds are remarkable.  We especially love the mill stone pathways, lovely landscaping and views along the water.  Enjoy...you'll want to go back again!

<br/>Box 2
<br/>
<br/>Location:  Southeastern, Virginia -- Virginia Beach, VA
<br/>Name:  "Meditation Garden"
<br/>e-mail: loveletterboxing@aol.com
<br/>dropped by "The Russ Clan" 5/19/02
<br/>Edgar Cayce Foundation grounds off of Atlantic Avenue
<br/>
<br/>This is a tiny little plot of earth...but soooo special.
<br/>
<br/>Say a prayer and meditate
<br/>cross the bridge--walk on slate
<br/>
<br/>Have a seat, gaze at the wall
<br/>listen to the water fall.*
<br/>
<br/>In a stack of rocks, above the pond
<br/>lies a box, and a pad to stamp upon.
<br/>
<br/>It's near the ground and crystal blue,
<br/>it sits there waiting just for you.
<br/>
<br/>It's on the right and towards the rear
<br/>you'll find the box that's to us so dear.
<br/>
<br/>Take good care and leave your mark,
<br/>we're glad you've found this special park.

<br/>*today it seems the little water fall was disabled but you'll know it when you see it.

a bustling place that was! If you do go for this box try not to go at <br/>
lunchtime- very busy!<br/>
 There was a man there trying to fix the pump in the waterfall, he <br/>
had the top of it pulled away but was no where near the bottom. Got <br/>
the box when he left for lunch.  I debated not putting it back but it <br/>
didn't look as though he was going to find it where he is working. <br/>
You may want to go and see it's status and perhaps pull it until he <br/>
has it fixed?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the stamp! <br/>
