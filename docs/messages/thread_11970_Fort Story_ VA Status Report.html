I've received a report that this box is missing.  The Fort Story <br/>
letterbox was recently replaced by a friend who was very familiar <br/>
with the location original location.  This particular box has been <br/>
reported missing before because when returning the box under the <br/>
walkway, boxers have been very diligent in making sure it remains <br/>
out of sight and they look for the most secure spot to put it in.  <br/>
Don't give up on this one, and if any of my letterboxing friends in <br/>
