<br/>
The way I did it (in my extensive experience of finding 1 HH) was:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Made sure the HH has the stamp of the box I found it in (it did.)  If you've already taken it away and find it wasn't stamped in, then maybe just make a note in the logbook of the HH that you found it there, and when.<br/>
<br/>
2)  I stamped into the logbook of the HH with the date I found it.<br/>
<br/>
3)  I stamped the HH into my personal logbook with the date and location that it was found.<br/>
<br/>
4) Went home and emailed the orginator of the HH (I happened to be able to track down their email address easily) telling them when and where I found the HH.<br/>
<br/>
5) sent an update to the LbNA and also the HH Yahoo groups (I"m sorry I don't recall offhand the same of the HH one - I can find it later if someone else doesn't know it off the top of their heads.)<br/>
<br/>
6)  Took it with me to a new box and stamped the HH into it's new host box' logbook - dating when I dropped it off.<br/>
<br/>
7) Also stamped the new host box into the HH logbook with date of drop off.<br/>
<br/>
8) When I stamp into the host box, I also made a note in my own log that I dropped off the suchandsuch HH.<br/>
<br/>
9) Emailed the orginator of the HH and let them know that I had dropped it off in a new box.  I told them the state, so they'd know how far it was moving, but not the specific box I put it in.<br/>
<br/>
I think I got it mostly right - and will look forward to any other suggestions of how to handle them.   I hope this is at least semi-helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Tortoise<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I found a HH. Now what? <br/>
&gt;I know I plant it in an existing box, but what do I stamp in the HH <br/>
&gt;journal? How do I keep track of where I put it? Who do I tell about <br/>
&gt;finding it and planting it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I thought the concept was really easy until I found one. I just don't <br/>
&gt;want to mess it up.<br/>

You should post the name of the HH and where you found it to the list. The<br/>
people who create HHs love to hear where they have traveled to.<br/>
<br/>
When you find a HH make sure to stamp the stamp of the box in which you<br/>
found it at into the HHs journal.<br/>
<br/>
When you take it to another existing box stamp that box stamp into the HHs<br/>
journal as well. Also stamp the HH into the stationary boxes journal as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to stamp your info into the HHs box  too!<br/>
<br/>
That still sounds confusing doesn't it? Hope I was of some help.<br/>

It is a really tedious process (takes at least twice as much time as a normal <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My son has now gotten hooked.  He is seeking the Ct.State Forest series.  At <br/>
Quidduck he found a second stamp which was a very strange stamp, no log book <br/>
for this stamp.  The stamp had a "D" on the back and on the log book for the <br/>
state park stamp was Please Help Murder.  He believes this is a HH and has taken <br/>
it to hide somewhere else.<br/>
I have never come accross a HH like that before.  Is it something different? <br/>
new? or someone pulling a prank? Or is it some clever HH?<br/>
