                    <html><body><p>Time to get a few last minute details taken care of in anticipation of Saturday's event. <br/><br/>If you are planning on putting a last minute box in for the Gathering make sure that you post it soon or bring copies of clues on Saturday. I know of a few poeple that won't be checking their emails the last few days before the event. I will bring a few copies for boxes that are in the immediate area. <br/><br/>Make sure that you contact Shannon ( <a href="sdon4373@postoffice.uri.edu">sdon4373@postoffice.uri.edu</a> ) and let her know what you plan on bringing for food.  We are using the names people sent me and food confirmations with her to determine a head count.  </p>
<p>I am assuming that people will be stopping by the picnic area throughout the day and then everyone heading back there around 3 or 4.</p>
<p>Hope for good weather and see you Saturday.</p>
