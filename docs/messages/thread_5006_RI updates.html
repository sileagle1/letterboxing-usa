                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted everyone to know that Dad and I went out Saturday and Sunday last weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday we travelled out to the Minimalist Series and everything was there and mostly in good condition.  "Gotcha" appears to have been broken in two for a while (wasn't sure if it was supposed to be?) and "Pain" was missing its stamp pad.  Replaced a couple of the plastic bags and made sure everything was dry.  Great boxes, lots of fun (except for the hole that I stepped in near the end ;-).  I loved your April Fool's Day humor.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday we attempted "Signs of Life"  After some confusion we finally found "Wiley" (I think our definitions of immediately right are very different)and then off to find "Kermit".  Moved on to area #6 and found the grass is now waist high made walking very interesting. "Peter" was found with little trouble, but after being out most of the day and pushing through the grass "Bambi" stayed hidden.  Anyone going out there should make sure to spray an extra dose of bug spray.  The farmer who works the corn field there told us they have had a large number of deer ticks.  <br/>
<br/>
Great way to spend a couple of days.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My apologies to everyone about the high grass.  When I placed these <br/>
boxes there was still nothing really growing yet.  I went out last <br/>
week to check the boxes and had the same problem Debbie did.  The <br/>
grass is very high and the ticks are very bad this year.  I suggest <br/>
you wait until fall for this series until after the first frost. <br/>
(unless you don't mind wading through extremely tall grass LOL.) It <br/>
does make a nice winter walk.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Has anyone found the "Frosty Drew Quest" box in Ninigret Park <br/>
recently?  It is a great park; the clues are very good and fun to <br/>
follow; but we believe the box is truly not there?<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Trustom Pond (RI) "East Point" box (box #1) is missing. <br/>
There is no longer an observation tower; but a new lookout deck, so <br/>
there are no stairs for hiding.  We did find Trustom box #2 (west <br/>
point) it was in good condition.  What a beautiful location!!!<br/>
