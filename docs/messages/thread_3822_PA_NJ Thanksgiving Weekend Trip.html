                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hope everyone had a fine "Turkey Day"!  We were sorry to miss the big family dinner this year, but, having left a couple of "half done" boxes in PA that we ran out of time for on our way home from VA late last spring, we thought this would be our best opportunity to get back out there and finish them!  Altogether, we managed to find our first 9 Wingfoot boxes on the way down, 5 more Mapsurfer boxes, our first 4 Perfect Circle boxes, and a series of 5 in CT on the way home!  We don't wish to "spill the beans" about exactly which boxes we found, so all we can say is that all the above were in great shape, and the only ones that seem to have gone missing  are Wingfoot's "Tripod" and PCLG's "Panic" (which we had already suspected).<br/>
<br/>
We had such a great time that we'll really be looking forward to heading back down there the next chance we get (President's Day?) and searching for other folks boxes as well ... plus maybe next time we won't feel QUITE so intimidated about driving in NJ!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the fun,<br/>

Sounds like you two had quite an adventure.  I'll check on the Tripod <br/>
Rock Letterbox shortly, I was worried that it may go missing as it <br/>
was quite close to the trail and had been found by accident at least <br/>
once before.   <br/>
