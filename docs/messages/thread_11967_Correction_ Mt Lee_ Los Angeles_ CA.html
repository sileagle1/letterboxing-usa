Find this letterbox and you'll be rewarded with a rare view of the <br/>
Hollywood Sign from the back. Find Franklin Ave, just north and <br/>
parallel to Hollywood Blvd. A few blocks east of Vine is a small <br/>
street called Beachwood. Take this north for a ways, through several <br/>
stop signs, until you come to Ledgewood, and go left. Follow <br/>
Ledgewood uphill until you come to a five-way intersection. Go <br/>
straight ahead and slightly to the right, merging with Deronda. <br/>
Follow Deronda as it winds past luxurious houses, all the way to the <br/>
end where there is a white wall and gate on the RIGHT. Park and go to <br/>
the left of the gate where you will see a small pedestrian gate, <br/>
letting you into the service road. Don't worry about the restricted <br/>
entry signs; these are referring to cars. Follow this concrete <br/>
service road to the top of Mt Lee, where you will see spectacular <br/>
views of Burbank and the San Fernando Valley on your right. As you <br/>
near the top and the road curves sharply to the LEFT, you will see a <br/>
green chainlink fence ahead. Starting at the right end of the fence, <br/>
count 10 fencepoles to the left. Stand with your back to the tenth <br/>
pole, and walk straight ahead into a sandstone cliff face. About <br/>
seven feet up from the ground is a small hole, with the letterbox <br/>
buried in sand. After, continue a short ways up the road to see the <br/>
enormous Hollywood Sign letters from the back, with the Hollywood <br/>
Reservoir and Hills spread below you.<br/>
