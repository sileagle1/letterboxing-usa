finally been replaced.  The hiding place has changed, so throw out <br/>
the old clue (if you have it) and print out the new one.  I don't <br/>
think anyone found the last stamp before it went missing, but in case <br/>
you did, don't go out of your way to find this one since I just <br/>
recarved the same image.<br/>

the entire African Safari Series) are broken.  It seems the URL is <br/>
SOO long, it's broken over two lines and the link doesn't include the <br/>
part broken on the second line.  You'll just have to cut and paste <br/>
both parts into the address box of the browser to get them to work.  <br/>
(Or follow the links from the letterboxing website.  Those still <br/>
work.)<br/>
