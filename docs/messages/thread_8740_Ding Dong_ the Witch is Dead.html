they caught the Sniper in the DC area.  We celebrated by heading out<br/>
and letterboxing for the first time in over a month.  Ended up having<br/>
a great day on Saturday.  Had great weather, saw lots of great fall<br/>
colors and had our most productive day yet.  <br/>
<br/>
9 Boxes<br/>
2 Hitch Hikers (these are our first ones)<br/>
1 exchange (Hi Rich)<br/>
9 deer (all in one herd)<br/>
countless squirels<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone in the No VA area for placing so many boxes in such<br/>
great locations.  <br/>
