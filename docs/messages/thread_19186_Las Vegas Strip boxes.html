Just spent 24 hours in Las Vegas.  I only had time to find two that were<br/>
on the strip (Triangle Building and Feeling Lucky).  Triangle Building<br/>
needs more paper (unfortunately I had to pack lightly, so I didn't have<br/>
any of my supplies) and Feeling Lucky is missing the stamp (although I<br/>
used the M&amp;M lid of the microbox as a stamp).  I had two<br/>
non-letterboxers with me and I think they were more excited than I when<br/>
I found them.  They made good cover for me as I was digging through the<br/>
brush for Feeling Lucky.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finding Feeling Lucky was pretty funny actually.  We spent 20 minutes<br/>
looking through the top of the brush.  It was already dark and there<br/>
were a lot of people standing around taking pictures.  I asked one of my<br/>
cohorts to cover me as I sat on the ground and just reached under the<br/>
fence.  I know reaching around on the ground in the dark in Las Vegas is<br/>
probably not the safest thing to do, but I was leaving for the airport<br/>
shortly and I wasn't going to give up.  I must have felt around for<br/>
about a minute and felt something plastic.  I pulled it out and there it<br/>
was!  My friend said, "Oh, you're good!"  Like I said before, I think<br/>
they were as excited as I about finding the boxes.<br/>
