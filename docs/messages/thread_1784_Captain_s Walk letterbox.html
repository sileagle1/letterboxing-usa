Those were my footprints. Since Vic and I just visited that box one <br/>
week ago, I was a little alarmed to hear the report of it missing. <br/>
Yeah, it's just fine. I feel a little bad though--I should have been <br/>
more conscientious about "covering" my tracks when I checked on it!<br/>
<br/>
One more thing about that box...I'm not sure that out-of-towners <br/>
unfamiliar with Mystic will know how to get to the box now that the <br/>
bridge walkway is closed til spring. It's something to think about <br/>
with regard to the clues...<br/>

Most people wouldn't even make a second glance. I didn't realize or <br/>
notice the walkway was closed with the bridge work: you're right that <br/>
we'll have to revise the clues temporarily. Thanks! Jay<br/>
