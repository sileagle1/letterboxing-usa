                    <div class="plaintext-content">My sister, Nancy Anne, is visiting from Sacramento. She had never <br/>
boxed before, but I carved her a stamp to her specifications and <br/>
bought her a log book, and today I  printed out many local clues for <br/>
her and Sir Balthazar spent his whole Sunday driving her (and me) <br/>
around to places where she might find letterboxes.  He even recarved <br/>
the missing Bow of Legolas of his Middle Earth Series and walked it <br/>
to where it belonged in spite of his knee pain so that she could have <br/>
that one in her book as well.  He is the most heroic of friends and <br/>
badgers anyone could hope to know.<br/>
<br/>
Nancy learned to use a compass and how to count a pace, and ordered <br/>
Sir B. to drive her from place to place all day as she stamped in at <br/>
box after box.  She had a great day, and I got to spend the day in <br/>
the company of my boyfriend and favorite badger, and my sister at the <br/>
same time.<br/>
<br/>
I think all three of us completely exhausted ourselves, but I feel <br/>
incredibly blessed.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Sir Balthazar, for being so kind and patient with me <br/>
always, and and so kind and patient with my sister too, today.  <br/>

You do have one lucky sister, Jugglermouse. I'm pleased to have met Sir B and <br/>
don't doubt his sincerity and thoughtfulness to Nancy Anne. Be sure to tell <br/>
her there are several good boxes in the Sacramento area and points east and <br/>
west on Highway 80 including the "Hwy 80" series and A-Bear's plantings in <br/>
Truckee and Vacaville. The "American River Bike Trail" series was alive and well in <br/>
June too and don't forget the "Best of Davis Series", all intact.<br/>
<br/>
Take care. You just might see a couple more northern CA natives than you <br/>
thought next Saturday!<br/>

Letterboxers take nothing and leave nothing<br/>
 but good impressions. Sir B<br/>
