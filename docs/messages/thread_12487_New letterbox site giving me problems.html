Please don't run off until you've given the new database a fair <br/>
shake.  Submitting clues under the old system was close to <br/>
overwhelming those few who actually did the work.   The sheer <br/>
volume has already caused us to lose  dedicated letterboxers <br/>
who were involved from the beginning. <br/>
<br/>
Once you get over the learning curve of joining, adding your own <br/>
boxes and searching for clues is pretty painless. <br/>
