                    <div class="plaintext-content">I realize that I'm a little behind the curve on this, but we are having a little trouble with our email,and server. We join those that do not want their letterboxes,clues,methods and other work properties listed on any data base other than the official LBNA web site. We do give permission to Pete &amp; Wanda to list any locations or travels our hitch hikers have taken. The data base listing allowing any one to input and post on a list is creating a possible vehicle for vandalism regarding letterboxes and clues. Lack of control in this case could lead to problems. Didn't improper posting already take place ?  We have two groups in our letterboxing family- The Finders ,and The Placers. Please don't get in an uproar as we need both. There is one thing that Finders have to realize about Placers- We keep a proprietary interest,or at least we think we do, in our children (letterboxes) that we so eagerly plant. We like to have comments about our stamps,clues and locations and if they are negative send them to us directly. Posting on some bulletin board called a data base may not be appreciated. Gwen &amp; I like to plant letterboxes in special places, great views,waterfalls,cool parks,etc., we don't plant boxes just to increase your stamp count. Most  of our clues ,and hikes are easy enough to make a successful hunt and gain another stamp image but if you can't locate our letterboxes contact us and we will be happy to give you a hint. Our goal is to take you to a neat location or have a fun experience. I see the goal of the data base as making it easier for Finders to increase their F count. I believe that not finding every letterbox is part of letterboxing. As a child did you find Easter eggs under every bush you looked under? I think not, nor will you find every letterbox you look for. If you need to contact the Placer do it by communicating directly or on the Chat List. Don<br/>
