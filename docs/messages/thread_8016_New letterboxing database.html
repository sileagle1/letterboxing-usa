Subject: Maybe California?  Kayak Boxes<br/>
<br/>
Good morning,<br/>
<br/>
Months ago, I belive I read clues to a couple California boxes that I <br/>
would like to be pointed to again.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems like one had to have a book, perhaps a novel, to get <br/>
important details of the clues, and then the boxes were on coastal <br/>
islands which were best reached by kayak.  <br/>
<br/>
OK.. that is the sum of my memory on this.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a email pen pal in San Diego who is big into sea kayaking.  If <br/>
the boxes happen to be near there, I would love to send him the <br/>
clues.  <br/>

I liked very much what I saw when I looked through your web-site.  It <br/>
still mystifies how people can work with these things.  I have two <br/>
small questions, and if there redundant I'm sorry.  Are you going to <br/>
add an area for "mystery boxes" and "hitchhikers"?  <br/>
It's an execlent site, thanks again.<br/>

&gt; Well, first let me say this:  I am a nerd.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now that you know that, it will make sense to you when I say that I<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; bored the other day, so I decided to write a letterboxing database<br/>
website.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would love it if people want to try it out and let me know what<br/>
they think<br/>
&gt; about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's the low-down:<br/>
&gt; - Anyone can search and view letterboxes.  Right now, letterboxes<br/>
are listed<br/>
&gt; by state.  However, as more boxes are entered, search methods will<br/>
grow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - To add a letterbox, you must create a login.  Use your email<br/>
address and a<br/>
&gt; password.  All this does is identify you so that no one else can<br/>
mess with<br/>
&gt; your boxes.  You'll have to confirm your email address, but it's<br/>
easy to do!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - Once you've added a box to the database, you'll be able to see<br/>
it, and be<br/>
&gt; able to make changes to it.  If you go to visit your box and it<br/>
doesn't<br/>
&gt; exist, you can modify your clues to say that it's gone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's it, really.  You can post, edit, and view your letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you get an error, I'd love to hear about it, too!  Copy the URL<br/>
from the<br/>
&gt; address bar and any error text and send it to me, PLEASE!  If I get<br/>
bored<br/>
&gt; again, I'm going to add some automatic error reporting, maybe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now that you've read this far, head on over to: <br/>
&gt; http://www.wesgarrison.us<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Praises and flames both appreciated, but please don't clutter up<br/>
the list<br/>
&gt; with comments that everyone wouldn't want to read.<br/>

<br/>
If you are looking to do some letterboxing, we are<br/>
releasing the clues on October 5th for two new<br/>
letterboxes at Holcomb Farm in West Granby, CT. The<br/>
Unlucky Clucky letterbox is already listed and resides<br/>
on the farm.<br/>
<br/>
October 5th(raindate 6th) is our Fall Festival here at<br/>
the farm.  It costs $4 per car to park and enjoy the<br/>
fall festivities such as pumpkin painting, hayrides,<br/>
baked goods, music, guided hikes, and much more! <br/>
<br/>
Come on down to the farm and do some letterboxing with<br/>
us!<br/>
<br/>
After the 5th, the clues will be posted to the<br/>
letterboxing website.  Holcomb Farm and the trails are<br/>
free and open to the public with 322 acres.<br/>
<br/>

Subject: my NPS rule reaction<br/>
<br/>
Hi, guys.  I don't post much to the group in terms of comments.  I<br/>
usually just submit clues to boxes I have hidden....some of which are<br/>
probably on National Park property...can't say for sure because I never<br/>
knew there would be a problem with it.  I've hidden quite a few along<br/>
Blue Ridge Parkway, and a lot of those are probably on NP land.  I am<br/>
deeply saddened by the issues the NPS have taken with letterboxing.  The<br/>
entire concept of hiding letterboxes on Blue Ridge Parkway was born of a<br/>
great sentimental notion.  Someone "rehiding" these boxes would only<br/>
serve to void the sentimentality the box held when planted in the first<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
I have always tried to "play by the rules", but I have also never cared<br/>
much for useless rules that only serve to stifle someone else's<br/>
enjoyment.  I agree with the person who says that the only reason<br/>
letterboxing is deemed a "threat" or "inappropriate" is because it isn't<br/>
understood.  Letterboxing seems to appeal to only a minority of people,<br/>
which serves the sport well.  But, in this instance it puts us against<br/>
the wall.  The NPS is a lot bigger than we are and can make outrageous<br/>
claims that the general public would swallow whole.  Only the few<br/>
individuals who letterbox would know the absurdity of their accusations.<br/>
<br/>
I would hope that these statements are made as a safety net incase<br/>
"something happens"...the NPS could say "we made every effort to prevent<br/>
such atrocities by explaining our objections to letterboxers and<br/>
removing every known box".  (seems ridiculous...)  But, maybe it was<br/>
simply said to pacify some loudmouth, and now that it has been said it<br/>
will be laid to rest.  Or...I'm just wishful thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Should I remove my Blue Ridge Parkway boxes, or simply let them be<br/>
confiscated and die an honorable death?  :(<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well, I've had a couple of comments that people may not want to see the <br/>
date that a box was last visited.  Personally, if I were to see that a <br/>
box hadn't been verified in a year or so, I'd probably email the owner<br/>
to see if they knew it still existed.  That way, I don't tear up a bunch<br/>
of ground looking for something that doesn't exist.<br/>
<br/>
If you have input on what you think, I'd like to hear it.<br/>

Just curious (and it's early in the morning, so perhaps this would be <br/>
more obvious in daylight)...  why would somebody not want to know the <br/>
status of a box?<br/>

Hey Wes -<br/>
<br/>
I will send you a excel file with the states and counties. Let me <br/>
know if you want more details. For the database could we enter <br/>
the 'Date Placed' - that way I can load historical letterboxes with <br/>
the correct date placed.<br/>

<br/>
Made my 16th trip to Nantucket last week with something new to do-- Took<br/>
a <br/>
Mt. bike out to find letterboxes!! Total BUMMER though. . .looked for 4<br/>
and <br/>
found ZERO! Brandt Point, Sankety, Altar Rock and the Abiah Folger rock<br/>
boxes <br/>
were not to be seen. Except for the last locale, these sites are WAY too<br/>
<br/>
public and visited by high schoolers out for fun so the chance of them <br/>
surviving was nil. I knew this before I started out but went anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is, my husband and I continued our trip through MA, RI, CT<br/>
and <br/>
NJ and were able to find 9 of the 10 we looked for, the 10th probably<br/>
lost to <br/>
recent road work we think. I made a convert out of my husband and at KJs<br/>
Best <br/>
in Coventry (what a Mecca for letterboxing!! Wish we'd had more time!)<br/>
he <br/>
bought his own stamp there (Grizzly Bear for the CAL bears UC Calif) and<br/>
<br/>
stamped along with me!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to someday get back to this area for a few dozen more! Meanwhile,<br/>
we'll <br/>
be planting some new ones in Northern California.<br/>

Subject: The NPS Letter<br/>
<br/>
I spoke with Dwight Dixon, the ranger from the C&amp;O canal who wrote <br/>
the letter, today. Real nice and understanding dude.<br/>
Yes! I did it the old fashion way, I called the gentleman up on the <br/>
telephone. <br/>
<br/>
He stated that he recently learned about letterboxing, and that he <br/>
thinks that it is a very interesting sport and can understand the <br/>
interest and fun in the sport. He did state that he is familiar with <br/>
geocaching and that he has removed numerous boxes from that sport.<br/>
<br/>
 He stated at present time it is not illegal to hide boxes in the NP.<br/>
BUT in the future it may. At present the NPS is looking into revising <br/>
their CFR 36 report, so that geocaching and letterboxing will be <br/>
illegal. And mostly do to the fact that geocaching has been the <br/>
greatest problem for the park service.<br/>
<br/>
He did comment that at present it is up to the park superintendent of <br/>
a region to decide which park may have harsher public use limitations <br/>
than other parks.<br/>
<br/>
AND this all has to do with:<br/>
1. Enviromental issues <br/>
For example protecting rare plants. You may plant a box at a time <br/>
that the plant is hidden under the ground and later when it is above <br/>
ground, someone else who is so excited about finding a box tramples <br/>
and kills the plant.<br/>
<br/>
2.Preserving historical sites.<br/>
For example,  gate locks, hidden indian burial sites, hidden civil <br/>
war campsites. He stated that the NPS does not let the public know <br/>
the location of these sites in fear of vandals. And that they would <br/>
not like them to be damaged because of people looking in that area <br/>
for a box.<br/>
<br/>
3.The welfare of the hiker/letterboxer/geocacher.<br/>
He stated that this year there had been three people who had been <br/>
bitten by snakes in the park.<br/>
Last year a geocacher while reaching into a hole was bitten by a bat.<br/>
ANd then there have been boxes hidden up high on cliffs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We then dicussed his comment about boxes being perceived as bombs. He <br/>
stated that each week someone calls the office informing the rangers <br/>
of a suspicious looking box. And that they must go out, do their job <br/>
and remove the box. <br/>
<br/>
He did state that if any letterboxer wishes to hide a box that you <br/>
CAN, but you must FIRST ask permission, get a permit and be shown <br/>
where it would be o.k. to plant the box. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This all sound fair to me. I think the man is just doing his job. And <br/>
the park service is trying to protect the park so that everyone can <br/>
enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
As someone pointed out the other day there are other places to plant <br/>
boxes.<br/>
<br/>

I was going to handle box status with a red, yellow, or green ball.<br/>
That way<br/>
people can tell if the box is still in place and verified (green), still<br/>
in<br/>
place but unverified (yellow) or unknown (red).  You can avoid the whole<br/>
date<br/>
business that way.<br/>
