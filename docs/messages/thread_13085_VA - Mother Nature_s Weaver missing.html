                    <div class="plaintext-content">Stopped by Fountainhead Park on the way to IKEA.  Found the backwards <br/>
number 4 tree and a white rock, but no box.  Sad, as I particularly <br/>
like spiders (assuming it was a spider).  It did seem like a very <br/>
exposed place.  Enjoyed Boxers Gotta Box and dog Tux stamped in.  It <br/>
didn't even rain too much.<br/>
<br/>
Visited Carderock Park in MD.  The Billy Goat trail really muddy but <br/>
it was interesting seeing the swollen, brown Potomac river rushing <br/>
by.  I want to go back to see how far over its banks it was.  Found <br/>
Falling Snowflakes and Carderock.  Really enjoyed their hiding places.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to Riverbend meet this weekend.  Looks like beautiful <br/>
weather during the week.  I hope it holds.<br/>
