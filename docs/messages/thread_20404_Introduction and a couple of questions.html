                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone!  I'm relatively new to this list but have been<br/>
letterboxing for a month or so now.  Just wanted to pop in and<br/>
introduce myself briefly and maybe ask a question or two.  I go by<br/>
Circus (both by 'net and by letterbox), and my partner and i were<br/>
introduced to letterboxing through a friend who stumbled across an<br/>
article on the subject.  Ever since then, we've been faithfully<br/>
heading out every weekend in search of letterboxes.  Although we live<br/>
in upstate New York, we often visit New Jersey, Connecticut, and the<br/>
Boston area, so we try to find a new box with every visit.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of questions for the list that hopefully won't be too<br/>
hard to answer!<br/>
<br/>
First: We were unable to find a few very promising letterboxes<br/>
recently.  We're absolutely certain that we were in the right places<br/>
and had followed the clues properly, but alas, no luck.  I've tried<br/>
using the "Contact Placer" function on the LbNA website, but haven't<br/>
heard back from anyone.  So, question number one: does that function<br/>
work?<br/>
<br/>
My next question is one of etiquette.  Is it okay to try to confirm<br/>
the location of a letterbox with the person who placed it if you've<br/>
tried to find it but were unsuccessful?  Is there a standard way of<br/>
asking whether a box has been recently found or whether the placer (or<br/>
whoever is taking care of it) can confirm that it's still there?<br/>
<br/>
Finally, i have a question that hopefully will be an easy one: We<br/>
haven't placed any boxes yet but are coming up with a few ideas here<br/>
and there and are excited to start.  Do you have any advice for the<br/>
first-time placer with regard to clues, locations, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Whew!  I hope that wasn't too long and boring.  We're both really<br/>
excited about our newfound adventures!  Perhaps someday we'll attend a<br/>
gathering....  Anyway, nice to meet you all, and i hope to hear back<br/>
from some of you soon.<br/>

Hi Circus,<br/>
<br/>
Since you are relatively new to letterboxing you may wish to check <br/>
out http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
 You should peruse the various tutorials found on Silent Doug's site <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info  or Ryan's site <br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/  many answers to your questions can be <br/>
found there if not on the FAQS page at LBNA.<br/>

Oh how I often I have been certain I have been in the right place <br/>
only to be WRONG!  :)  I'm rather notorious for it actually.  The <br/>
best way is to first contact the placer- as you did.  Hopefully you <br/>
will hear back within a few days.  Tell them exactly where you were- <br/>
if you describe it well enough you're likely to get a response such <br/>
as "oh- you were SO close, instead of standing on that ledge, you <br/>
need to be a bit further inland.  Pay close attention to "x" part of <br/>
the clue..." Or someone may be even more specific.  OR, they might <br/>
tell you someone else had trouble finding it &amp; that they will go <br/>
looking themselves &amp; get back to you.  OR you can post on the list <br/>
which box it was &amp; I will bet that in a matter of hours there will <br/>
be a couple of helpful emails asking if you looked under the 3rd <br/>
rock to the right of the twisted tree.  :)  But try the placer first-<br/>
 they are your best resource.  And, FYI, when you DO find a box, <br/>
it's nice to contact the placer as well- we all like to know when <br/>
someone has found our box &amp; if they enjoyed it.  Plus, then we know <br/>
whether or not it's still around!  <br/>
<br/>
It's always okay to contact a placer.  I box with two small children <br/>
so I often contact placers BEFORE heading out to see when the last <br/>
time was that a box was found or how long of a hike I can expect.  I <br/>
don't want to be half way through the clue &amp; realize that I have 6 <br/>
miles ahead of me- we'll never make it.  So I try to prepare ahead &amp; <br/>
if I can't find the answers, I usually try a different box.  There <br/>
are lots out there.<br/>
<br/>
The best resource for box placement are the FAQ's on <br/>
www.letterboxing.org, atlasquest, Silent Doug's site at <br/>
letterboxing.info  Just follow the links over on the left side of <br/>
this page for a wealth of information.  And read lots of other clues <br/>
to find out what you want to do- a puzzle, a straight up, easy to <br/>
follow clue, a rhyme- the sky is the limit.  As for location- off <br/>
the beaten path &amp; anywhere that won't harm nature or create an <br/>
unnatural path (&amp; for my own preference, please stay away from <br/>
poison ivy!)  Remember that if it's a spot that you love to go to, <br/>
chances are so does everyone else &amp; the box will be tough to <br/>
retrieve.  Have fun &amp; enjoy yourself!  Read everything on boxing you <br/>
can find &amp; plant well!<br/>

Contact the placer is always a good place to start .<br/>
They may have heard from others that the box is<br/>
missing. Don't be discouraged sometimes a second look<br/>
or re-reading the clues will turn up a box.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow--thanks, everyone, for the welcoming and detailed replies!  I've<br/>
spent quite a bit of time poring over the FAQs on various letterboxing<br/>
websites, and I've joined the newbie list, and it's all been very<br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I think we'll probably head back and try a couple of the boxes again. <br/>
It turns out that one of the ones we couldn't find is a microbox, so<br/>
we probably missed it.<br/>
<br/>
One last question (and after this i promise i'll keep quiet and listen<br/>
for a while!):   I've done some searching and reading of FAQs and<br/>
checking the archives here (so many pages of messages!), and it seems<br/>
like there are a fair number of boxes in urban settings, and a fair<br/>
number of boxers who are interested in finding them.  Being a<br/>
city-lover, i'm thinking of placing a few in slightly more urban<br/>
settings (e.g., city parks).<br/>
<br/>
So, to the question itself--are there any official guidelines on urban<br/>
letterboxing?  I assume that the basics are generally the same<br/>
(respect the environment, etc.), which seems like common sense; are<br/>
there any special considerations beyond the basics that need to be<br/>
made for placing urban boxes?  I've been unable to find any definitive<br/>
answers, so i figured it would be worth posting here.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, i hope that wasn't too painful.  I'll stop with the silly<br/>
questions now! :)<br/>

I can think of three considerations in urban parks.  There are more <br/>
visitors to the parks, so you need to hide the box better, and <br/>
boxers visiting the box are more likely to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
The parks are kept cleaner.  There are maintenance people who pick <br/>
up litter and trash, so the box is more likely to be found and <br/>
investigated or tossed out as trash.<br/>
<br/>
The parks are better patrolled by the police or park authorities.  <br/>
The box or the boxers who come to visit are more likely to be <br/>
mistaken for criminal or harmful activity.<br/>
<br/>
The safest way is always to sit down with the park superintendant <br/>
and explain letterboxing to them.  Explain how it will bring nice <br/>
families and outdoors visitors to their nice park.  Any response <br/>
from lukewarm agreement to enthusiasm will pave the way for good <br/>
public relations for letterboxers.<br/>
