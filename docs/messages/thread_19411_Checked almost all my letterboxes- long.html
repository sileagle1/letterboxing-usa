                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, today I tried to kill myself, or at least my knees. I checked on almost all of my letterboxes today and don't know how many miles I walked, but it was a lot!

If these are in any databases anywhere &amp; someone wants to update that database, feel free. <br/>
<br/>
So here goes:<br/>
<br/>
OHIO Boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Harrison Area:<br/>
<br/>
Library- I didn't get to this one today, but if I can walk, I'll try to get it tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
There's No Place Like Home- Also missed this one but will check it tomorrow if I can<br/>
<br/>
You Can't Handle The Truth- Good Condition<br/>
<br/>
What We Have Here is a failure to communicate- Good condition<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna need a Bigger Boat- replaced the full log book<br/>
<br/>
I See Dead People- added extra pages since there was room for them.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Dog Series- all good<br/>
<br/>
Bonus Box- (by Franzsolo) good<br/>
<br/>
Waterbird- couldn't check this one due to a party at the pavilion<br/>
<br/>
Colorful Castle- was laying out in the open, fully exposed. Otherwise in good condition. I fetched a rock from near the Piliated box so I could wedge it in it's hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
Piliated- good<br/>
<br/>
Harry Potter series- THE CLUES to boxes 2,3&amp;4 ARE MISSING from inside box #1. The last time any were stamped into was mid June, so it must have happened recently. I'll add the additional clues to the main clues for the box on letterboxing.org. Maybe someday I'll get the laminated hardcopy back into box #1. <br/>
<br/>
Purple Mtn.- (Mad Dawg's). In good condition, but it was totally exposed and visible from the trail! I'm surprized it wasn't gone. I wedged it back in it's home. It was also last visited in mid-June.<br/>
<br/>
Badlands Trail- Franzsolo's -was in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
Witch Way, was completely exposed and visible from two trails, but due to the camo tape and mud, it was actually hard to see unless you were looking for it. I wedged it back under it's rock. <br/>
<br/>
In Honor of...- good condition<br/>
<br/>
The Giant- good condition, I'll be making a very minor clue clarification.<br/>
<br/>
INDIANA BOXES:<br/>
<br/>
Sunday Drive and Picnic- I'll check these tomorrow, they were off the route I took today. I think I can manage a few steps from the car :-) They have been reported to have full log books.<br/>
<br/>
Cedar Grove Church- has been a busy spot. Had to replace a full log book<br/>
<br/>
in Franklin County park:<br/>
The park personnel have completely changed their numbering system, so almost all the boxes in this park need minor clue changes. I'll do my best to make all the corrections tonight. Almost all the boxes were there, but most log books only had 2-3 entries. It's not that far from Cinci and it's a scenic drive, get out there and enjoy them  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Why does it always have to be snakes: good- clues will be updated<br/>
<br/>
Vodka Martini, shaken not stirred - good- clues will be updated<br/>
<br/>
I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way- good- clues will be updated<br/>
<br/>
Badges, we don't need no steenkin badges- good, I added a few more log book pages even though I didn't really need to. Clues need a minor update due to the disappearance of a landmark I used.<br/>
<br/>
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse- good<br/>
<br/>
Who Ya Gonna Call- MISSING, but replaced with "I love the smell of napalm in the morning -aka- Apocalypse Now". Same clues, new name &amp; new stamps. I found the container for Ghostbusters, but not contents.<br/>
<br/>
Hilltop Overlook- (franzsolo's) good, added some pages. No clue change needed.<br/>
<br/>
Brookville Dam:<br/>
That's not a Knife- I replaced the container because the first one was a bit too small and the stamp was getting bent. Hopefully it will straighten out. Still very usable.<br/>
<br/>
Heeear's Johnny!- good<br/>
<br/>
We've all got it comin kid- I didn't check this one because my knees were really sore by this point and the long walk across the top of the dam in the sun was not something I wanted to do. I was recently reported in good condition.<br/>
<br/>
Metamora:<br/>
Old Metamora Mill- was exposed, but otherwise good. I tucked it further under the rock.<br/>
<br/>
Old Post Office- also good and has been busy, I replaced the full log book<br/>
<br/>
Tow Path Park- This one has been elusive for some, easy for others. I was confused by such conflicting reports from people. When a person reported it missing, I wasn't too surprised, but then the next person would say they found it without any trouble. It went back and forth like this a few times before I had a chance to check it today. When I went to look for it, I found the 'pie shaped' rock missing. I thought the camo covered film canister was also gone, till I dug just a little bit in the mud. I found the perfectly camouflaged MUD covered container right where it was supposed to be! Unfortunately, it was completely soaked inside. I replaced the container and the log pages, but left the same stamp. I also moved the box to a new location &amp; will update the clues tonight.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that's all of them that I could get to today. I'll do my best to check on the few I missed tomorrow. In the next three weeks, I will be taking three different trips and will be home a total of 2 days! At least I don't have any travel planned for August :-)<br/>
<br/>
Scoutdogs - tired and sore, but happy that my boxes are still in place and doing well :-)<br/>

I don't live nearby, and unless my lotto numbers come up I probably <br/>
won't get to see any of these boxes, but I enjoyed your post and want <br/>
to thank you for sharing the updates with the list. It's nice to see <br/>
such a follow-up effort, and you're setting a great example. Thanx!<br/>
