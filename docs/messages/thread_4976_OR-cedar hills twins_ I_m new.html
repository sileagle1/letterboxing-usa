The Traveling Circus made an outing for those two boxes a couple of <br/>
weeks ago and found the first twin had taken a hike but the second was <br/>
alive and well. I think a fair amount of new planting has been done <br/>
since the clues were written so take care when looking for it. Welcome <br/>
to the local Lb scene. Will you be at the Tualatin Hills Nature Park <br/>
event on the 27th? Funhog<br/>

luck only I'm sure.  This was back in November 2001.<br/>

If you want to send me an email describing where you think the <br/>
missing box was supposed to be, I'd be happy to tell you if you<br/>
are in the right spot.  If you decide to do this, please send<br/>
it to me only and we'll keep it a secret for the rest of the <br/>
folks still to look.<br/>
