    Just wanted to let you know that my daughter and I found your <br/>
letterbox at Great Bay in Durham, NH on New Year's Day.  I think we <br/>
were the first ones to find it because all the other stamps appeared <br/>
to belong to Drew Clan members!  It was harder because of a foot of <br/>
fresh snow, but we didn't want to get caught in the storm on the way <br/>
upstate on Saturday and post-poned our search until Monday.  We <br/>
really enjoyed stomping around in the snow, and were glad that we <br/>
were still able to follow the clues.  We just had to watch out for <br/>
the duck hunters!   <br/>
    Hope to do more Drew Clan letterboxes soon, even if we need to <br/>
dig in the snow!<br/>
<br/>
Deena and Shelley<br/>
