As kids we often had fun with it because when you plunge it under water, it appears to be made out of pure silver.  Even drops of rain on it will bead and appear silver.  In this area (Eastern PA) it APPEARS from May through October, but only blooms for part of that time and I'm sorry I don't recall when.  But it's easy to spot without the blooms because of its succulent look.  --lunaryakketyact<br/>
