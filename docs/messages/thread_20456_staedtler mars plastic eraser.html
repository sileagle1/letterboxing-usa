The raised logos that are embossed on these erasers are very hard to remvove. <br/>
Because they are deeply embossed even when you think you have gotten rid of <br/>
them they still show up when pressure is applied. I took one of these erasers <br/>
and ran it over fine sandpaper glued to a piece of wood. When it looked like it <br/>
was smooth I inked it and pressed hard and a faint image appeared. They are <br/>
great erasers and I use them for map plotting and gave one to my son for his <br/>
school work. <br/>
