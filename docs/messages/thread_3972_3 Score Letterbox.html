<p>Location: Essex, CT </p>
<p>Relatively easy walk</p>
<p>Less than 30 minutes</p><b><u>
<p align="center">3 Score Letterbox</p></u></b>
<p>Three score times two is a century and twenty.</p>
<p>To be together that long, there must be love a-plenty.</p>
<p>Don’t stop halfway, there are two stamps to this quest.</p>
<p>Once you see the pair, you’ll find that together they are best.</p>
<p>To begin this trek dedicated to these two,</p>
<p>Here is what you should do…</p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>Park behind Captain Pratt’s old school, which now handles the town 
business—hope that’s enough information for you to get the gist.</p>
<p>You are led to the book keeper by the first walkway, you should pass this 
brick building to your right on this pleasant day. </p>
<p>The second brick walk leads you aCROSS (West Ave.)--to the PRESERVE, don’t 
get LOTS.</p>
<p>Proceed carefully through the two sets of sentries, both of whom are awaiting 
your entries.</p>
<p>Continue on now up the lane to a quiet place—no need to hurry, this isn’t a 
race.</p>
<p>Pass between two maples-1 sugar, 1 red—no, don’t stop here, forge on 
ahead.</p>
<p>If you have a thirst to quench, take a rest on Harriet’s bench. </p>
<p>…for that matter, bring your lunch!!!! Munch, munch, 
munch!!!!</p></dir></dir>
<p>Proceed down the lot to the European Beech, the treasure from here is nearly 
in reach.</p>
<p>Follow the woods path down to the right, the end of your search is almost in 
sight.</p>
<p>Step through the opening in the stone wall and HALT, turn right, be careful 
not to fall.</p>
<p>10 GIANT steps along the piled stones--check around carefully, be sure you 
are alone.</p>
<p>Look in the wall at ground level, and you will see a sight at which you will 
revel.</p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>Centered between two cedars(on the back side)-- behind the flat stone, does 
the first box hide.</p></dir></dir>
<p>22 more GIANT steps along the stone wall, the other half of the pair awaits 
you all.</p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>The overhanging cedar shelters from the weather, the pinkish granite stone 
which guards this treasure.</p></dir></dir>
<p>This letterbox was placed in honor of this pair</p>
<p>A special destination, we are glad you could share.</p></div>
