<br/>
Naked Woman in the Waterfall was left open, top of the box off, and caught last week's rain storm, apparently, and all the contents were floating in a containerful of water. :-(  Lots of the stamp images are ruined but not entirely lost (what was that smudge?) and the ink messages are still legible.  I took her home to dry her off and dry out the pages of the log.  Hopefully I can return everything tomorrow sometime.  Thank you all for the visits!  This is her second log book since Betz and I first placed her.  The waterfall was running fast and furious tonight!  I bet this spot was just gorgeous lately in the warm autumn sun.  I'm figuring some non-boxer happened upon this box by accident and just left the box open.  Maybe there is a geocache close by because the box gets lots of trinket-type stuff in it.  Unfortunately, just about all of those things were ruined from sitting in the box of water.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier today we took Dan's mom to do the Scituate Puzzle. I didn't see the placer's name in any of the log books but will try to get in touch.  I'll try the "Contact the Placer" option, although I often feel it's a dead-end as I often get no response from attempts.  Anyway, the first box was trashed and apparently all the contents stolen.  I recovered the box and lid but scouring the area for pieces of the contents turned up nothing else.  I have the empty box.  I have been to this series twice before and both times I found the first box somewhat exposed, but this time it was just tossed and empty.  It probably should be moved. There was a bag of trash behind the port-a-john that might have the stamp or logbook in it because it appeared to be from someone doing litter patrol.  The other boxes were very carefully replaced this time around, way better than we found them in the summer.  However, #3 was very wet inside.  The log book is extremely damp but some of the images are okay.  We went pretty far to the back of the book to leave our stamps.  (I redid mine in this log because my previous one was washed out).  Dan wiped the box out but the bags had either not been zipped closed last time or they have holes.  The owner may want to go check these out; we had no extras with us today.  Boxes #2 and #4 were well hidden and in good shape.  <br/>
