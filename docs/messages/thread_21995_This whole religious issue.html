Right....Politics and religion.  So, how about we all<br/>
stop bringing up either of them.  <br/>

I usually keep out of these conversations. I for one think this<br/>
conversation has been very well conversed. No real big flames (except Mr.<br/>
Toohey). I think it is interesting how he talks about being considerate of<br/>
other religions. That seems to be okay for every religion, except<br/>
Christianity. As soon as this is mentioned it gets blasted. Phooey Toohey.<br/>
Hee hee I couldn't resist.<br/>

derrogatory or ad homonym attacks. I said religious boxes are OK if<br/>
they are clearly labled so. I didn't seek out the boxes that offended<br/>
me I was taken there, but that's a different issue. I said we have to<br/>
tolerate other religious views and I do. There are appropriate places<br/>
and times to discuss religion. I still assert that a box put out there<br/>
for the GENERAL public in all it's diversity is INSENSATIVE of people<br/>
with other views. For the people who practice reductio ad absurdum,<br/>
yes there is someone who will be offended by anything but it's pretty<br/>
common knowledge that it's best not to discuss religion or politics in<br/>
casual conversation. Anyway, the consensus seems to be that<br/>
unsolicited religious info is not appreciated. That is pretty much my<br/>
position. Put the religious boxes out if you must but please warn<br/>
people if it's not evident in the clues. How's that a flame?<br/>
