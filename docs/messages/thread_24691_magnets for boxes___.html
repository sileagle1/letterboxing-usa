We've used magnets for geocaches, and have seen them on LBs, as well.<br/>
 You need to be particular about the kind of magnet that you buy. <br/>
"Standard" magnets oftentimes are not strong enough; the kinds sold at<br/>
crafts shops are usually of this sort.  What you will generally find<br/>
to be the best are neodymium magnets.  Neodymium is a "rare earth"<br/>
element; when mixed with iron and boron, it makes the strongest<br/>
magnets commercially available.  They come in various sizes and are<br/>
available in just about any hardware store, as well as many hobby<br/>
shops.  They are also available on-line through almost any science<br/>
supply house.  They are a little more expensive than regular magnets,<br/>
but one small one is often better than two or three standard magnets<br/>
of the same size.  I use Loktite and Duco glues; anything similar is<br/>
probably good.  I would imagine that Crazy Glue will also work; I just<br/>
find it harder to work with and clean up after.  Let the glue "set"<br/>
fully, of course.  The hardest thing, if you use two of them, will be<br/>
to keep them from moving toward each other while the glue is setting :-o<br/>
