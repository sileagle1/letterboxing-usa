<br/>
I just finished (almost) carving my best stamp ever (go me!).  <br/>
Unfortunately, I have blue ink ALL OVER my hands.  I was using the <br/>
Just For Color brand Acid Free Dye Inkpad.  I have tried about 10 <br/>
different soaps and even tried spraying WD40 all over my fingers and <br/>
scrubbing.  It didn't even dull the color.  I look like part Smurf!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have suggestions on removing the ink from fingers?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Alcohol based waterless hand cleaner or sanitizers have worked well for me. Just plain rubbing alcohol works too.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I was about 12 I HAD to have a pair of royal blue Puma sneakers... "Had" as in I did extra chores to get the money... Well one day along blows a heck of a storm with torrential rain, in which I had to walk the better part of a mile in to get home.  <br/>
<br/>
Upon arriving home and walking in the foyer, I began to leave blue sneaker prints, which I found pretty funny at that particular moment.  The footprints led all the way upstairs to the bathroom, where I tossed the sneakers in to the bathtub, creating a loverly blue slatter pattern up the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Upon removing said sneakers, I discovered that the floor and walls were not the only things blue... from the ankle down, I looked like the Cookie Monster. It somehow wasn't quite as funny then<br/>
<br/>
Amidsts gales of laughter from my mother and sister, we tried EVERYTHING to get rid of the blue, until finally almost a week later, I had to soak my feet in water and bleach to get rid of it!<br/>

Good Luck<br/>
