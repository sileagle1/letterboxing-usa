row of newsstands on a busy street in front of a strip mall. The box <br/>
was alive and well, and, as expected after 2 months here in Southern <br/>
California, there were only two entries in the logbook. The first was <br/>
Buzzard, who frequently finds every new letterbox before anyone else. <br/>
The second was someone who stamped in, wrote his or her name, and <br/>
wrote "Bad directions" with a line underneath as if to emphasize this <br/>
point. Now, forgetting for a moment that they are CLUES and not <br/>
directions, and also forgetting that the very address to the store in <br/>
the strip mall and the precise newspaper box under which the <br/>
letterbox resides was clearly stated in the clues, and also <br/>
forgetting that the stamp was a piece that I worked very hard on and <br/>
actually came out pretty good... Why is it necessary to write <br/>
something negative in the logbook that every future person visiting <br/>
will see? I'm pretty new to letterboxing, but in the 61 boxes I've <br/>
found, no one has ever written anything negative other than "It <br/>
started raining!" or stuff like that... It made me want to rip out <br/>

It's your logbook, so rip out the page if you don't want it there. <br/>
Unless the remark is written on the back of the page that has Buzzard's <br/>
very fine signature stamp, as you wouldn't want to remove that!<br/>

well i would say go ahead and rip out that page if you want....nothing says you cant....<br/>
<br/>
all i can think of is the person may have gotten frustrated if there are numerous newstands they had to search under....but thats just part of the letterboxing game....HUNTING.....:)<br/>
<br/>
so feel better.....take a deep breath...and hide more letterboxes!!!!!<br/>

of July.  I really never respond to stuff on here because I'm so new and I <br/>
didn't want to start posting until I had a good feel for the list.  :)<br/>
<br/>
So...  as for the bad directions, I found a box yesterday.  The clues did <br/>
contain a bad direction.  They were good for the most part, but where the clue <br/>
indicated that I should go southeast, I actually needed to go northeast.  <br/>
Everything else was fine.  I was wondering if I should do anything about this, and <br/>
flipping through the book, I found that someone had written it in there <br/>
already.  They didn't write it in a mean way at all...  they just said, "This is <br/>
actually northeast from the landmark, but I found it anyway!"<br/>
<br/>
There are definately better ways to say something if directions are <br/>
legitimately bad than, "BAD DIRECTIONS!"  And you're right, they're clues.  There is no <br/>
rule as to how vague/specific they have to be.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, rip it out, if you feel that your clues were good.  There's no rule <br/>
that says you can't!<br/>

directions!<br/>
<br/>
In one's clues, one could warn ahead of time..."WARNING:  One clue is the <br/>
reverse of what it should be!"  Instead of turning south, one has to turn north, <br/>
or something like that.  Leave it to the hunter to figure out which clue is <br/>
false.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I don't know how I would feel about that if I was hunting a box, <br/>
or if I would be willing to do that myself.  But it's an interesting idea.  <br/>
Unless it's already been done.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I'm fairly new to letterboxing, just found my first box this week, <br/>
looking forward to more!  I'm on the beginner's list as well.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">    This seems to be a hot topic, so thanks for bringing this up.  I <br/>
am an outsider, really... in more ways than one.  I love planting <br/>
boxes a billion times better than finding them... maybe that is <br/>
because the closest box (that isn't mine) is nearly an hour away.  <br/>
So, I am not familiar with what "other people" do when they place a <br/>
box.  I don't know what the common containers are, the common type <br/>
of stamp, the common type of log, the common place, the common <br/>
clues, etc.  I follow my own "bliss" here and do what feels right.  <br/>
I get great joy out of creating and planting boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
    So, yes, I agree that it would be sooooo disturbing to find <br/>
someone "bashing" my box, or my clues, or my stamp, etc.  But, then <br/>
again, I don't hide them for you people. :)  I hide them because it <br/>
makes me happy.  I try to remember that.<br/>
<br/>
    But, even though I don't hide them so much for "you", I still am <br/>
very concerned that I balance everything out to make the finder have <br/>
fun, too.  I want it to be a "good one".  I leave my contact <br/>
information in ample supply, front and back of log, and sometimes I <br/>
leave an envelope of tiny "contact info" papers for people to take.  <br/>
I feel like this leaves the finder with a way to contact me if they <br/>
have an "opinion", or if there is a problem.  And, I have had <br/>
someone do this.  They e-mailed me when a clue was wrong and I <br/>
changed it quickly and fell all over myself with apologies.<br/>
<br/>
    My reason for continuing a "rant" of sorts is simple empathy.  <br/>
And, that I feel it is up to you whether or not you remove the <br/>
page.  But, if it was my box, I think I'd leave it in there as a <br/>
display of said boxer's selfishness.  Most boxers would read that <br/>
and feel negative toward the writer, not the letterbox... as it <br/>
should be.  Obviously this person has never created one of their own.<br/>
<br/>
    As for eating words, maybe today was their lunch. :)  Thanks <br/>
again for the topic.<br/>

Yes, it has been done already and the clues were awesome!!!  The <br/>

Saying this stamp "came out pretty good" is an expression of modesty <br/>

<br/>
Like others, I also don't feel that negative comments should be <br/>

letterboxers have had a problem with my clues or posts, they write me <br/>
privately (and they do).  Maybe the finder was just having a bad day <br/>
(though how you can have a bad day letterboxing is beyond me; I <br/>
letterbox as a relief from bad days). <br/>

I've found most of Q's letterboxes, and I'm quite jealous of her <br/>
