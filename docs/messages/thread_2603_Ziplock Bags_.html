                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey there.  Just wanted to let everyone know that we highly suggest<br/>
bringing along some extra ziplock bags during your searches.  We noticed<br/>
while checking up on our Proposal Series in Sutton MA yesterday that 2 out<br/>
of 4 of our boxes had ziplocks which didn't seal properly.  We were using<br/>
the Heafty sandwich type with the handy zipper that you move back and<br/>
forth.  I guess after some time they get derailed, and the log books get a<br/>
little damp from the moisture.  We ended up double bagging our boxes just<br/>
to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
I figure that others may run into the same situation in time, so in the<br/>
future we will carry some extra baggies when we are searching boxes...<br/>
<br/>
A nice caveat though is that the el-cheapo grocery store no-name clear<br/>
plastic reusable sandwich containers seemed to hold up pretty well.  They<br/>
do work well as a first barrier (especially if they are sitting on top of<br/>
a rock insulated from the ground).  But I wouldn't rely to much on them<br/>
alone or with one bag to protect the goodies.<br/>
<br/>
The other good news is that the four boxes are still were we left them 15<br/>
months ago with lots of we wishes.  Thanks everyone<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting.<br/>
Jeremy and Greta<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Like Jeremy:<br/>
I have found that the handy zipper bags tend to develop seal problems<br/>
related to the zipper derailing or being zipped a little to hard and going<br/>
off the end.  Also the generic bags do not hold up well.  I always carry<br/>
spare brand name bags, usually the ones you press together and the strip<br/>
turns green indicating a good seal.  I also carry a towel (to dry the<br/>
contents with), spare pens and spare copies of the "about letterboxing" page<br/>
(the one Mitch "Der Mad Stamper" provides at<br/>
http://members.aol.com/Letterboxr/infosheet.html).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just saw the note on bringing extra zip-lock bags (which my daughter and I <br/>
have always done!), and wanted to add that I bought an inexpensive "re-inker" <br/>
set that has primary colors to drag along as well. Some of the ink pads are a <br/>
bit dry upon our discoveries of the boxes!  We bring the zip-lock bags with <br/>
the "zippers, easier to close, not easy to mak a mistake and not close <br/>
properly. <br/>
