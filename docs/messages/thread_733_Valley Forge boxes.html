                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have received a few e-mails about the Valley Forge boxes possibly<br/>
being missing, especially since hurricane Floyd came through the area.<br/>
<br/>
Since this is the most beautiful time of the year to wander about the<br/>
park, I took it as an excuse check up on them.  I checked all but #5,<br/>
and they all survived the hurricane.  Floyd did do some erosion <br/>
and flood damage to some of the trails in the Mount Misery/Valley Creek<br/>
section of the park -- they have fixed some of them but not all, <br/>
especially up on the mountain, so be careful if you wander up there.<br/>
<br/>
The downed leaves and the old growth trees are really making the place<br/>
look spectacular.  There is this bowl up on Mount Misery that is just<br/>
so beautiful to walk (or run :-)) through.  Unfortunately, I think the<br/>
downed leaves make the letterboxing even harder -- trails are harder<br/>
to pick up, clues are harder to recognize, etc., but that's part of <br/>
the fun, I suppose :-)<br/>
<br/>
Remember, these boxes are on the difficult side.  I don't want to scare<br/>
anyone away, but I don't want to disappoint anyone either (especially<br/>
kids), especially since the hobby is so new, and people may have only <br/>
be used to doing easy sorts of boxes.  Happy hunting ...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Randy,  Me and the kids did try to find your "Walk in the Park" box near <br/>
the General's Abode ... George Washington's headquarters at Valley Forge, I <br/>
think.  We weren't able to locate the box but my kids (5 &amp; 7) we pretty <br/>
tuckered out ... we had just driven straight from Illinois.   I assumed it <br/>
had been washed away since there were still sand bags surrounding the stone <br/>
home....We had fun searching anyway.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for checking up on it!<br/>
