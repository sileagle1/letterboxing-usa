<br/>
But the Virginia section is rather messed up, geographically speaking.<br/>
Boxes are in regions that they do not belong in, geographically<br/>
speaking. The webmanagers have been alerted to this but as yet, I<br/>
haven't received much response nor have the regions been cleaned up.<br/>
<br/>
Having boxes in the wrong regions is frustrating for both<br/>
out-of-staters and for locals. The locals may know that a box listed<br/>
in Bedford County in the Central Virginia section should more<br/>
correctly be in the Western Virginia section, because Bedford is<br/>
outside of Roanoke, but out-of-staters may not know that. They're<br/>
thinking that Bedford is in central Virginia, when it is in the<br/>
southwest part of the state.<br/>
<br/>
Conversely, locals have to look through all of the regions instead of<br/>
their respective regions because the regions list incorrect counties.<br/>
For instance, I live in Central Virginia, but I've also found some<br/>
Central boxes listed in Northern Virginia and Southeastern Virginia.<br/>
<br/>
In one of the few e-mails I've received in response to these<br/>
observations, I was told that counties were arbitrarily assigned to<br/>
regions when the Web site was being redone. Now that hopefully the<br/>
dust has settled and the boxing community has settled in to this new<br/>
system, it's time to tweak the organization of boxes on the map so<br/>
that the boxes will be displayed geographically correctly.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be glad to again provide a list of the boxes that I've come<br/>
across in the wrong spots, if you think that would be helpful.<br/>

I agree that it can indeed be frustrating to not be able to find a <br/>
box listed in the region it is supposed to be in.  None of us active <br/>
letterboxers are from VA.  The best way to get it all correct is not <br/>
to fix the listings box by box.  It would be wonderful if someone <br/>
would volunteer to go over every available listing county section and <br/>
provide a listing to Wes of which section they should be assigned.  <br/>
that way it would be done correctly once and for all.<br/>

Are you going to do county by county or just region by region?  Cause you already know the counties you'd just need someone to tell you which county is which on the map.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've noticed this situation too.  It's a matter of decidng which <br/>
counties are in which section of the state - Northern VA, Central VA, <br/>
Southeastern VA, and Western VA.  You can see on the LbNA map of the <br/>
state which counties are considered in which area.  It's all <br/>
interpretation.  I'd call the entire I-81 corridor Western VA but it <br/>
could make just as much sense to put Winchester in Northern VA (where <br/>
it is listed now). I, for one, would not extend Northern VA all the <br/>
way to Richmond.  FYI to you non-Virginians, "Northern Virginia" <br/>
means something more than just a geographic region.  It's kind of a <br/>
political thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe other Virginians would know exactly, but isn't Northern <br/>
Virginia only Loudoun, Facquier, Fairfax, and Prince William <br/>
Counties?  Maybe Culpeper and Stafford, but I don't think it would <br/>
include anything beyond that.<br/>
<br/>
Trish - if we Virginians can agree where to draw the lines, can they <br/>
be changed?<br/>
<br/>
Virginians - rather than tie up this list in emails trying to sort <br/>
this out, you can write directly to me --  daughteroftheolddominion <br/>
at yahoo.com   -- and I'll coordinate the map correction.  <br/>
