<p><strong>Proceed to the main entrance of the Natchaug Forest 
which has a shield shaped state sign and is on the east side of route 198 in 
Eastford, 5  miles past the intersection of routes 198 and 6 in Chaplin and 
about 3 miles south of route 44. After entering the park, go over the bridge 
spanning the Natchaug river. Good fishing on this river and many nice picnic 
spots with tables. Go up the long winding hill until you get to a Y 
intersection. Bear right and quickly see the entrance to the Beaverdam Wildlife 
Management Area on the left. The trail you want is on the opposite side of the 
road. It is a bit hard to see but is the blue blazed Natchaug Trail. It is 8/10 
of a mile from the forest entrance. Proceed down the trail until you cross a 
wooden bridge over the beaverdam brook. See the ruins of an old mill on your 
left. Follow the blue blazed trail downstream until you come to two evergreen 
trees growing from one. You will see several trees like this but only one that 
has all the details listed here. It is alongside the path. Not several feet or 
more in. The tree has a blue blaze on it. At this spot the brook is flowing 
predominately West. Standing beside the tree, the tree is at 20 degrees. Take a 
reading on your compass and go 23 steps south to a space between two rocks. Go 
150 degrees 5 steps to a rock. Stand on top of that rock. Go 110 degrees 50 
paces to a large rounded rock. Go 140 degrees 8 steps to a small stack of four 
slabs of rock one on top of the other. At the bottom southwest side is an 
opening and you can get the letterbox here. Short walk but lots of trees and 
rocks to choose from if you are not careful. Good luck. </strong></p>
