Letterboxes" I've had a heck of a time figuring out the site, so I'm glad it <br/>
is being revamped.  I am including clues for my first letterbox unless I need <br/>
to submit separately. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Johnny Dingo<br/>
Box Name: Strictly for the Birds. (This is a working name. The actual name is <br/>
in the box and on the stamp, but would be a dead-giveaway)<br/>
Date placed: Apr. 12, 2003<br/>
Located in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, Charleston county.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
1) Find Mathis Ferry Road and locate the traffic roundabout. <br/>
2) Exit the roundabout to the North. <br/>
3) The second right will put you in a small parking lot. Park here or nearby. <br/>
<br/>
4) Walk out the NE corner of the lot and turn RIGHT at 137.<br/>
5) Walk 73 paces to 4 palm trees and a sign on your left. Take a      minute <br/>
to read the sign.<br/>
6) Walk straight back behind the sign, bearing left, for 92 paces. <br/>
7) If you climb 6 steps, the box will be below your feet. <br/>
<br/>
Note: No ink pad or pencil is provided in the box.  Please be discreet as <br/>
this is often a high foot traffic area.<br/>
