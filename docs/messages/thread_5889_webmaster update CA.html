County has a bonehead typo in it that makes everyone end up in poison<br/>
oak and occasionally face to face with a rattlesnake. I was only off a<br/>
mere 300 degrees. What do they expect? The following includes the<br/>
correction. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
On December 9, 2001 Funhog placed the Empire Mine Letterbox near Grass<br/>
Valley in Nevada County, California.  For over one hundred years men and<br/>
mules toiled here thousands of feet beneath the earth's surface. They<br/>
drilled, blasted and hauled tons of ore in the quest for gold. Deadly<br/>
mercury and cyanide were used to extract the precious metal. The<br/>
continuous thundering of stamp mills crushing rock could be heard three<br/>
miles away. Today, the peaceful hiking trails of the Empire Mine State<br/>
Historic Park wend their way through the forest past the rusting,<br/>
weathered remains of many of the area's hard rock gold mines. At the<br/>
Visitor Center you can purchase ($1) a map of the Park's trails which<br/>
contains interesting information about the remnants of the mining era<br/>
that you will see along the trail.<br/>
<br/>
to the trailhead: From highway 49 take the Empire Street exit and follow<br/>
the directional  signs for the Empire Mine State Historical Park If you<br/>
begin your hike at the Visitor Center you will have the opportunity to<br/>
see the Empire Mine main shaft, assay office, owner's residence and<br/>
vintage mining equipment, well worth the $1 entrance fee. Follow the<br/>
Hardrock Trail toward Penn Gate. The loop is a little over 2 miles.<br/>
Alternatively, you can park at Penn Gate, .7 miles downhill from the<br/>
Visitor Center, for a brief half mile stroll to and from the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
to the letterbox: Walking along the Hardrock Trail you will come to the<br/>
junction for the W.Y.0. D. (work your own diggins) Trail. Take this loop<br/>
trail. This mine leased sections to individual miners and was considered<br/>
to be very unlucky. Find the signpost with the unluckiest of numbers on<br/>
it. At this point you will see a hard box at 220 degrees and sharp<br/>
strands at 5 degrees. Walk 24 paces toward the hard box to a trail<br/>
junction. Look for a ring of trees at 330 degrees. This is one time when<br/>
a descent into depression will be rewarding. With your back to the<br/>
smallest of three Ponderosas the letterbox  is in front of you at the<br/>
base of a clump of small trees.<br/>
