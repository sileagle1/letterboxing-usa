I will be taking a trip in a couple of weeks, driving from DC to NYC<br/>
going I-95 to the NJ Turnpike.  Does anybody know if there are any quick<br/>
an easy boxes to find along this route?<br/>
<br/>
Also, for everyone that attended The Gathering last month in VA, it was<br/>
great to meet all of you!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, there are several and after the next two weekends there will be at least 5 more, not more than 10 minutes off of 95 in Bensalem, Pa. To the best of my knowledge, the first and only letterboxes in Bensalem! We have been carving our brains out and have 5 boxes ready to plant, the challenge is that we want to do it as a team and it seems one of us always winds up having to work. Anyway, clues should be posted Monday for two small parks in Bensalem (one on each side of the Neshaminy Creek), each with 1 box. <br/>
And a jigsaw puzzle stamp 3 box series called "Treasure Hunt" that will be planted in Neshaminy State Park, off of the Delaware River. Hope you'll find time to visit!<br/>
