 To get your letterbox listed, you have to go to the <br/>
letterboxing.org site. Then down at the bottom, click on 'Submit <br/>
Clues'. Good luck and it's great having another new letterboxer <br/>
here. <br/>

&gt;Ok, I don't understand how to get my LB listed on the<br/>
&gt;www.letterboxing.org site. Ive found the couple nearby LBs and<br/>
&gt;decided to place my own so I did. But when I annonced it here (which<br/>
&gt;is how you get them listed somone one told me), nothing happened.<br/>
<br/>
Announcing your clues on this list won't get them listed on the site-- not <br/>
since earlier this year when the site was revamped.<br/>
<br/>
Now you can enter your clues yourself on the site. Go to <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/MemberServices.asp and click "Sign up." Enter <br/>
your email address, choose a password and type it again to confirm it, then <br/>
enter your "trail name" in the space where it says "first name." You'll get <br/>
a confirmation email; click the link to activate your membership. Then <br/>
you'll be able to submit your clues to the site.<br/>
<br/>
