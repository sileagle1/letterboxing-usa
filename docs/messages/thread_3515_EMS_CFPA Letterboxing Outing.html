<div>Okay, so this is darned late notice to all you out there that 
may not know about it already. This Saturday the 20th at 10am, a joint 
get-together between folks from the Connecticut Forest and Parks Association and 
EMS Shoppers/letterboxers will take place at Patchaug State Park off route 49 in 
Voluntown, CT. I invite any and all to attend as there will be new and old 
letterboxers alike. We'll check out Father's Day Flowers and Misery Loves 
Company while we're there and chat a bit about Letterboxing ettiquette, where to 
place them, how to place them, Leave No Trace ethics, and also place a box or 
two or three while we're there! Oh, yeah, we'll also probably chat a bit about 
some orienteering (or land navigation with compass). Hope to see some of you 
there if you can make it. I hear the weather should be cooperating.</div>
