                    <div class="plaintext-content">Although I am relatively new to Letterboxing (the past year), I have <br/>
been to a number of Martain Maggot's boxes and for those that still <br/>
remain (that I have found so far) they posess some great home made <br/>
carvings.  I appreciate the effort that she made in carving the <br/>
stamps, planting the boxes and writing the clues.  There are some <br/>
long walks involved there and some great experiences with nature.  <br/>
It's what Letterboxing should be about - the whole experience.  <br/>
Through e-mails that I have had in the past with Rick_in_Boca <br/>
(who 'adopted' some of the boxes), I do believe that he was trying to <br/>
be helpful in "adopting" the boxes and helping to maintain them.  I <br/>
am also under the impression that it was done with the permission of <br/>
the LBNA head honchos. Maybe they would like to comment here on this <br/>
situation.  I certainly was not privy to any conversations between <br/>
Rick_in_Boca, Martian Maggot and LBNA with regard to the matter (as I <br/>
was not around back then), so I cannot comment on the details and am <br/>
not here to take sides - no matter who is right.  It does seem from <br/>
her recent post that although she moved out of the area, Martian <br/>
Maggot does care alot about the boxes she left behind.  Letterboxing <br/>
has become a great experience for me and my family in the last year <br/>
and I really enjoy it, so I thank all those who have taken the time <br/>
in the past to leave behind this great experience for me to enjoy. I <br/>
hope the situation is able to be resolved so that all concerned are <br/>
in agreement and we can continue to enjoy those boxes that were <br/>
placed by Martian Magott.  However, if resolving this situation is <br/>
not meant to be, then I wish everyone concerned the best that life <br/>
has to offer.  There's not enough joy in the world nowadays.  Let's <br/>
do something about that.  Let's Letterbox More.  -John.    <br/>

&gt; I am pulling the clues for all of my boxes, hidden throughout NJ <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; ME.  My boxes were adoped by someone else, which, when asked, I <br/>
said <br/>
&gt; I did not want that to happen.  The clues have been altered, to <br/>
give <br/>
&gt; hints to people, which I find unacceptable.  If they are too <br/>
&gt; difficult for people to find, then so be it.  No one should have <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; right to change someone else's clues, or take over their boxes <br/>
&gt; against their express statement.  I can see now how much the <br/>
&gt; letterboxing community has altered since it's inception, and it's <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; wonder why people have left.  It's not all about the box.  I'm <br/>
&gt; genuinely upset that someone else is claiming my effort and <br/>
&gt; creativity as their own (I read a clue that doesn't even have my <br/>
name <br/>
&gt; anywhere on it), and will not participate.  <br/>
