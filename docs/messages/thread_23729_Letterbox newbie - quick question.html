Planting is as much a part of my history as finding is.  I stamp them right<br/>
in with my finds, and I mark them as plants (as if I wouldn't recognize one<br/>
of my own stamps...).  That way I can follow along and see that I planted<br/>
this box while I was out finding boxes in that area.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I would caution though - don't shortcut and stamp the box until<br/>
you are actually hiding it.  Twice I've decided I would go ahead and stamp<br/>
my plant in my logbook at the car so I could leave most of my gear, and<br/>
twice I've not been able to plant it for one fluky reason or another.<br/>
