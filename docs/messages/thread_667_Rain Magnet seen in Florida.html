You had me laughing out loud Graham.  I am glad you were able to see some humor in the situation.  It is unfortunate though.  I guess you'll have to come back at least one more time.  I believe your hypothesis needs more testing.  Might I suggest a state other than Florida.  We have quite a few letterboxing hubs developing around this great land.  Then again there are a few more states to hit by Y2K!!!!<br/>

&gt;Subject: [LbNA] Rain Magnet seen in Florida<br/>
&gt;Date: Wed, 22 Sep 1999 08:22:51 +0100<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From Graham Howard<br/>
&gt;aka The Moorland Wizard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well...my reputation as a rain magnet is now becoming fully<br/>
&gt;internationally developed.  (Not only in Dartmoor)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I went off to work merrily with the intention of doing some letterboxing<br/>
&gt;and even visiting Disney in Florida over the week of 10th-17th September<br/>
&gt;last.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What happened ?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You may well ask !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In two words  "Hurricane Floyd".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was "evacuated" from my nice office in Titusville by order of the<br/>
&gt;Governor of Florida....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was evacuated from my colleagues nice home on the beach.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I got no trip to Disney..It closed for the first time in its history.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My nice trip to locate and place boxes in the Titusville swamps was<br/>
&gt;"washed out".<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So as a service to all Letterboxers I shall be issuing a "rain warning"<br/>
&gt;whenever I visit your location in future <grin><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Still P0F0 in the USA ...<sob sob=""><br/>

&gt;Graham, by any chance were you in Paris in April, 1980 (which was the<br/>
&gt;first <br/>

<br/>
Almost certainly....I am there most weeks in the Spring !<br/>
<br/>
And it rains more than they advertise it !....in fact Paris is either<br/>
stifling hot (August) or wet (any other month) or closed ( Tuesday<br/>
Wednesday or Thursday..or any optional day with a Y in it )<br/>
<br/>
Dont get me wrong...I studied at INSEAD..a branch of the University of<br/>
Paris (in Fontainbleau) and love France ..and esp French food and<br/>
wine..but believe me it rains there whenever I am visiting..in fact during<br/>
my studies they had the coldest winter on record and I (and some other mad<br/>
students) walked across the frozen Loire River.....100 metres to one<br/>
bank..one hundred metres to the other and one hundred metres to the bed of<br/>
the river...MAD or what ?<br/>
<br/>
In fact I can only recall rain and snow ?.....have I always been a rain<br/>
magnet I wonder (LOL)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I ask because it rained nonstop AND the museum <br/>
&gt;guards at the Louvre were on strike, so the Louvre was closed.<br/>
<br/>
No don't worry it wasn't you......if it's France it is closed...situation<br/>
normale !<br/>
<br/>
Today they've even banned all cars in Paris...can you imagine it !<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry about your Florida misadventures!<br/>
<br/>
We'll be back .... !<br/>
<br/>
But thanks !<br/>

<br/>
I'm off to Rome on Wednesday and Thursday 29 / 30 so guess where its gonna<br/>
rain....LOL !<br/>

No problem... just schedule your next American visit during the Fall (or <br/>
Winter... or Spring... or early Summer) in Portland, Oregon.  No one will <br/>
notice the difference!!!<br/>
<br/>
While in Portland, of course, you could always get in out of the rain and <br/>
hook up with some letterboxing buddies at the local brewpub.  After a few <br/>
pints of porter, you'll be thinking you're in Dartmoor again!!!   ...if only <br/>
the people didn't talk so funny!!!<br/>
<br/>
Many regards,<br/>

Such Joy....I could really get down to this ....  On my son's CD Atlas - <br/>
(The .."Beautiful America" Series...real cool videos and photos ! ) ,<br/>
Portland looks a real super cool place for boxes..and if it comes with<br/>
"brewpubs" it has a definite double appeal.....have you got boxes in pubs<br/>
yet ?...They have them in Dartmoor...It takes a "real letterboxer" to<br/>
collect 20 pub boxes in a day.....and a driver <g>...and Alka-Selzer<br/>
<br/>
Regrettably the university hasn't yet seen a month of Letterboxing in<br/>
Portland as a legitimate research field trip.......I keep submitting it to<br/>
the research fund teams and one day they'll pass it and before they<br/>
realise their mistake I'll be on the plane before they can say Hurricane<br/>
Warning   <g><br/>

You should hear how funny they speak in Dartmoor...or is that what you<br/>
meant <chuckle><br/>

<br/>
ps<br/>
<br/>
Still to get off the P0F0 line.....<br/>
<br/>
pps<br/>
<br/>
Love the new kids photos.....that is really great..get em young and<br/>
they'll be letterboxers forever !!<br/>
<br/>
Now if each one of those places two or three boxes each and gets two<br/>
friends to go boxing and they place two or three boxes each<br/>
themselves..and...........My goodness it's LbNA !<br/>
<br/>
Magic !<br/>
