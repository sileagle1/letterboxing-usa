Brand new letterboxers here!  My dd's (5 &amp; 10) and I found our first box 10/21 after letterboxing was mentioned on a homeschooling e-list that morning. We kept it very simple and found "Rocky Raccoon's Letterbox" in southeast NY.    We are excited about future hunts.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question.  There were notes in the box indicating the other box on the same trail could not be found, however, the notes did not indicate if the missing box was the Leatherman box.  The Leatherman is the only other box listed in the same park in Westchester county.  I tried to email the planter of the raccoon box to see if they have any information and haven't heard back yet.  Anyone on this list know what's up with the boxes at Turkey Mountain?<br/>
<br/>
Oooh - this is all so exciting....<br/>

We aren't from Utah, but if you go to Silent Doug's Web site you <br/>
will find a list of regional chatlists. I'm not sure if there is one <br/>
in Utah, but there is one in the Pacific Northwest. At Atlas Quest <br/>
there are boards set up for every state too.<br/>

There may also be a regional group that includes Utah, but I am not <br/>
