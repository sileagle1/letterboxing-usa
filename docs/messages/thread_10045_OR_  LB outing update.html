<br/>
Just got back from a few days in Oregon and were fortunately able to <br/>
work in a little letterboxing in the process.  Here's an update on <br/>
some of the boxes we could/couldn't find during our adventure <br/>
through Portland.<br/>
<br/>
Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Oregon Trail LB, Oregon City--in great shape<br/>
<br/>
Mom, Mexico &amp; Me Series, West Linn--found 1,2,3,4 &amp; 7 (no luck with <br/>
5 &amp; 6--possibly missing?)<br/>
<br/>
West Linn Mystery LB--missing  (the owner said it will be replaced <br/>
soon)<br/>
<br/>
2nd Annual Thanksgiving LB, Lake Oswego--in great shape<br/>
<br/>
Tryon Creek--Der Mad Stamper Series--all 4 in great shape with MANY <br/>
visitors and plenty of room left in the log--the Red Fox's clues <br/>
should be revised as the leaning tree in the end of the clues has <br/>
officially fallen, the Bird Watcher's box was totally exposed but we <br/>
corrected that when we finished stamping in--GREAT SERIES &amp; A GREAT <br/>
WORKOUT, TOO, with a 30 lb baby in the babypack!!!<br/>
<br/>
Tryon Creek Orphan placed by Wendy (no email for her, though)--great <br/>
shape<br/>
<br/>
The Lost Letterbox Mystery LB--missing?  We're almost certain we <br/>
were in the correct spot but there were no LBs anywhere remotely <br/>
near where the clues suggest.  Anybody know if this is officially <br/>
missing?<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great trip to OR with the proper Portland ambience of <br/>
torrential downpours during our excursions...  ;)  Thanks everyone <br/>
for some great adventures in and around the Rose City!!!<br/>

future letterbox, though!  ;)<br/>
