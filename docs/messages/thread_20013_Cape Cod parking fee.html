While I can't be *positive* we were in the right spot,<br/>
we had asked the Visitors Center for directions to the<br/>
boardwalk (the directions we got matched the clue<br/>
sheet directions).  I'm not quite sure what was going<br/>
on there...the people in charge of collecting the ten<br/>
dollar fee were posted in front of very "unofficial"<br/>
looking, wooden boards (the "$10.00 parking fee" was<br/>
actually written in marker on the board).  A little<br/>
strange!  Anyway, while I'm sure we were in the right<br/>
area, I've certainly been wrong before... wouldn't be<br/>
the first time we've misread a map or a clue sheet! <br/>
