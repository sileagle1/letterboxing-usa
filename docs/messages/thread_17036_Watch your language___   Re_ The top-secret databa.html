Spirited debate that results in better understanding<br/>
is not a bad thing, but personal attack and using a<br/>
list like this to demonstrate your inability to play<br/>
well with others is pointless and inflammatory.<br/>
<br/>
And for the record, I DO have young letterboxers, and<br/>
we've been working on new stamps the past few days. <br/>
They have been using the archives to help us with<br/>
certain points in making stamps.  Not that they've<br/>
never heard or seen adult language, but I don't much<br/>
care to have them exposed to it gratuitously,<br/>
especially in the context of someone railing against<br/>
common courtesy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for speaking up Steve, Heidi and Madras.  I<br/>
agree entirely.<br/>
