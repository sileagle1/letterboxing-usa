                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went searching for Calvin and Hobbes in Calvin Park in Rockville, MD <br/>
last weekend.  Naturally Calvin was uncooperative.  We searched and <br/>
searched and retraced our steps and contemplated missingness for <br/>
Calvin.  Below zero weather and the icy ground didn't help.  There <br/>
was only one rock by the suspected tree and it was clearly stuck <br/>
hard in the ground, too much to move.  We gave up and looked for <br/>
Hobbes.<br/>
<br/>
Hobbes was easily found and very cooperative.  After treking Hobbes <br/>
back to our warm car to stamp in we decided to have another go at <br/>
finding Calvin.  I thought I'd bring the tire iron to make him <br/>
listen to reason.  <br/>
<br/>
The stuck rock was not actually buried deep but only stuck to the <br/>
ground by the ice.  The tire iron convinced it to yield and there <br/>
was Calvin hiding underneath.  Not giving up so easily the box <br/>
itself was also frozen stuck.  Unfortunately it yielded by <br/>
breaking.  Ackk.  That must be why they say to use freezer quality <br/>
boxes.  Apologies to Poison Ivy for breaking Calvin's box.  We <br/>
double extra zip lock baged it so it should be alright.<br/>
<br/>
We were transmortified but really enjoyed the hunt and the stamps.<br/>
