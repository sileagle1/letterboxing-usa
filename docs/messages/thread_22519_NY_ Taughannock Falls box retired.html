                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow - we were just here a few weeks ago (visiting from Ohio) glad I <br/>
got in while it was still open.  I have visited this gorge many <br/>
times &amp; every time have enjoyed walking in the stream bed not really <br/>
thinking of the danger other then it being very slippery.  Maybe you <br/>
could find another location for a new box in this area - maybe more <br/>
along the actual trail.  I will keep an eye out for it on my nect <br/>
visit. <br/>

&gt; Taughannock Falls is a truly special place.<br/>

great if you could find another more suitable place for a box for <br/>
the next time I come up there.<br/>
