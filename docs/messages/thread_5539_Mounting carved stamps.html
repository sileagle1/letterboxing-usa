<br/>
I just carved my first stamp.  Woohoo!  It's the signature stamp I'm going to use for letterboxing.  Since it was my first attempt, I used an inexpensive dollar store eraser that's 1/4" thick.  The medium is just too thin to be stamped without mounting it.  The pink carving medium I plan to use for my other carvings is about the same thickness, so I'll want to mount that, as well.<br/>

Now for my question. How do you mount your carved images?  I normally use rubber cement as a bond between the cushion and the die.  Will the rubber cement cause any deterioration or brittling of the eraser substance?  After all my hard work, I certainly don't want to cause any damage to the finished product.<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to hear your suggestions.  Thanks in advance,<br/>
