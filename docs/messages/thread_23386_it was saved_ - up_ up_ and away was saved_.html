                    <div class="plaintext-content">well i have some wonderful news. B is for billy is ready to be placed <br/>
back in it's home. white sands will be placed back in it's home. and i <br/>
was able to save up, up, and away, from the flooded stream. it took me <br/>
awhile to get to it, but i managed. soon that box will be back in it's <br/>
home. i no doubt that this act of nature was something that probably <br/>
won't happen again for quite some time. i hope.<br/>
<br/>
also, i have not found the owner of "let's ride the skateboard HH"<br/>
<br/>
anyways lets go boxing<br/>
