MANSFIELD, CT   TOLLAND COUNTY<br/>
RATED: EASY (10 MIN)<br/>
<br/>
    Children's laughter is music to my ears.  My daughters helped me <br/>
with this box and it's hiding place: I could listen to them laugh <br/>
and talk forever.  Indian Princess and Princess Aurora both go to <br/>
school at Anne Vinton - so we decided it should go there, where <br/>
children's laughter could be heard all recess long. <br/>
     Take Route 32 in Mansfield, CT to Anne E.Vinton Elementary <br/>
School.  Pull into the parking lot and bear left with the driveway <br/>
to the north side of the school.  Park by the free standing <br/>
classroom in the rear of the school by the baseball field.  From the <br/>
northeast corner of this building find the Nature Trail (this can <br/>
also be accessed from Quail Run - longer walk).  Follow the trail to <br/>
the top of the first hill where old man pine stands gracefully in <br/>
your path: walk five paces (right foot count) and find madam oak <br/>
standing by a stone wall and large rock. Look between this majestic <br/>
oak tree and her fellow rock: just behind them in the stone wall <br/>
you'll find your prize. Beware of coming during school hours, you <br/>
may be caught red-handed!   Enjoy your children and letterboxing!<br/>
