planned. The Cowboy's oxen club has called together a work meet where <br/>
we get our ever important lessons and we need help with cart work and <br/>
a back gee. Thats oxen terminology you will learn more about when we <br/>
plant our oxen series in June . They will be along the path we travel <br/>
on a special Mansfield 300 Commemorative ox drive we are doing. There <br/>
will also be a special "traveler"  going with us so as to entice a <br/>
few folks to join us for a bit of the walk. We will be out there for <br/>
about a week to make the 40  mile journey. More details to follow as <br/>
the planning is still underway.  Leader of the Pack<br/>
