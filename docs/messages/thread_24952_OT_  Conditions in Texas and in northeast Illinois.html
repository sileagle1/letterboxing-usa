                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here in my backyard in Villa Park, IL my rain gauge showed 10 inches.  A<br/>
family I know in Lombard had their rain gauge measure 9.5 inches.  Since<br/>
both houses on either side of my house have kinda worked to get their water<br/>
to drain over onto my property, my backyard was a lake yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
A lake complete with mallards in fact.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Friday evening, I had loads of goldfinches flitting around my backyard<br/>
scarfing down my sunflower leaves.  Then Sunday morning I woke up to<br/>
mallards swimming.  Quite a difference.<br/>
<br/>
That's OK.  A family on my mail route actually had mallards swimming in<br/>
their living room.  (I told them at the time years ago that they were really<br/>
building their house a wee bit too close to the creek.)<br/>
<br/>
But that's still absolutely NOTHIN' compared to the hit the folks in Texas<br/>
took.  I hope and pray that all Texas letterboxers and their families are<br/>
safe and that everyone who needed to evacuate got evacuated in time.<br/>

I had two letterboxes planted in my backyard.  Both in lock 'n' locks.  Both<br/>
ended up underwater and I waded out to retrieve 'em both this morning.  Both<br/>
were dry.<br/>
