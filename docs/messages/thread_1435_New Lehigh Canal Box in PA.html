                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Lehigh Canal stretches from MaChunk (Jim Thorpe) in<br/>
Pennsylvania's <br/>
Pocono reigon all the way to the city of Easton at the confluence of <br/>
theLehigh and Delaware Rivers. There is a walking/bicycle trail that <br/>
runs the length of the canal. These are a series of letterboxes<br/>
placed <br/>
along this former canal tow path. Clues for these boxes will be given <br/>
for travelers going in either the upstream or downstream direction.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the clues for the latest box:<br/>
<br/>
Up Stream From Bethlehem<br/>
<br/>
Godfrey's Box <br/>
<br/>
If you are coming from the previous box, pass the Tennis Courts, <br/>
Playground, and Ice House in Bethlehem,continue up stream under <br/>
another bridge through a large open areaand again on to the towpath. <br/>
(OR -You can start at the Ice House)<br/>
<br/>
Well past the next lock and footbridge over the canal, note the<br/>
blessed structure. <br/>
<br/>
Notice the train tracks on the other side of the canal, and eventually<br/>
come to a dip in the path. <br/>
<br/>
Look for a tall steel structure along the railroad tracks. It has a<br/>
windsock hanging from it. <br/>
<br/>
When you come to tree #2 (or maybe it's #22) continue six more<br/>
paces. <br/>
<br/>
The steel structure should be at 43 degrees from your position, and<br/>
you will see a large, hollow trunked tree behind you. <br/>
<br/>
DOWNSTREAM from Allentown <br/>
<br/>
Godfrey's Box <br/>
<br/>
Look for the bulbous red, white and blue water tower atop a hill on<br/>
the left. <br/>
<br/>
Well past this water tower, look for two white posts on either side of<br/>
the towpath. <br/>
<br/>
Beyond the white posts, look for a tall steel structure along the<br/>
railroad tracks. It has a windsock hanging from it. <br/>
<br/>
Find tree #2 (or is it #22). <br/>
<br/>
&gt;From this tree, turn and walk back upstream for six paces. <br/>
<br/>
Sight the steel tower at 43 degrees and look in the hollow trunk of <br/>
the<br/>
large tree behind you. <br/>
<br/>
Continue downstream to the city of Bethlehem. <br/>
