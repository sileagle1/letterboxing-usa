<br/>
I don't think its a silly question.  We talked extensively about using<br/>
state and national parks last year.  Since then, a few of us have tried<br/>
to contact parks and/or DNR's to discuss what we should do, if anything,<br/>
concerning letterboxing in parks.  I don't know if any of us heard back.<br/>
In the end we decided to take a watch and wait stance.  A few people<br/>
have since put letterboxes in parks<br/>
where you must pay to get in or have a sticker or pass.  My Split<br/>
Rock Lighthouse Letterbox is just such a letterbox.<br/>
See http://www.pclink.com/elf/mnmap.htm  The notes point out that you<br/>
will have to pay admission to get on the site.  I see nothing wrong with<br/>
this that would not also be wrong in a park for which you do not have to<br/>
pay to gain admission.<br/>

&gt;  ...Don't get hung up on the first state thing, there is no way to<br/>
&gt;  know if you have gotten the first one in the state anyway...<br/>
&gt;  ...What would be cool is trying to get one letterbox in every<br/>
&gt;  national park.<br/>
<br/>
My preference would be to not target state or national parks, but to<br/>
continue the watch and wait stance that we've had.  At the same time<br/>
I agree that this is a cool idea, very much so.  (So go Randy for<br/>
being creative!)<br/>
<br/>
We have letterboxes in parks already.  Its a common hiding place.<br/>
But some people may still have feelers out trying to <br/>
get better information on how best to use the parks and I'd like to<br/>
try to respect that, whatever it turns out to be.<br/>
When we were having the discussion on parks last year we all pretty<br/>
much agreed to respect the land, not litter, and to try to hide our<br/>
boxes well.  All this should help us to avoid problems.<br/>
<br/>
But I just want to caution people.  We are<br/>
spreading our letterboxes potentially all over the countryside.<br/>
We are doing this in many cases under the good graces of the state<br/>
and national parks systems.  They could revoke our right to do this<br/>
anytime, esp. if they feel it may cause them maintenance.<br/>
<br/>
So be respectful of the land (and the intent of the use of<br/>
park land in particular) which is primarily for nature and<br/>
nature lovers.  I would avoid planting boxes which may lead<br/>
to animals excavating the box (by using old food containers<br/>
for instance) and I would avoid having boxes lie out in the<br/>
open or with just a grass or leaf covering for instance.  <br/>
The weather may leave such boxes exposed and this would be <br/>
the equivalent of littering.  And I would try not to orphan<br/>
letterboxes if you can avoid it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, whatever you put in your boxes<br/>
try to make it respectful and dignified, so that if it is<br/>
found accidentally it will not lead people to any wrong<br/>
conclusions in general<br/>
about what we are doing thru letterboxing and therefore it<br/>
will not lead to many complaints to park people (or anyone<br/>
for that matter) and our right to use park land (or any land)<br/>
will have a better chance of not being revoked.  Its a slippery<br/>
slope, once people start complaining that will put the kabosh<br/>
on a good deal of our fun.<br/>
<br/>
So, while I think this is a good idea, (as good as the first<br/>
in each state/charity walk idea), I ask you to err on the side<br/>
of caution when it comes to using parks.  And, in general, I <br/>
ask that you always consider what you put in your letterboxes.<br/>
I'm currently designing some "kid stuff" for a baseball theme<br/>
series of letterboxes.  I plan to put them on my own property<br/>
and on my neigbor's property (with permission).  The added<br/>
benefit of this is that they will be close at hand and therefore<br/>
easy to inspect.  And we also have a lot of kids in my neigborhood.<br/>
These letterboxes will be very accessible for them.  I think they <br/>
will find it cool to hunt for a letterbox they saw on the internet<br/>
which is right on their own street.<br/>
<br/>
I like all the ideas i see on the list, everything from the "little<br/>
stars" for prizes to the "travelling stamp" to the "charity walk"<br/>
to the "put a stamp in every park" to the "letterbook" to "50 by Y2k"<br/>
- very creative ideas.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
