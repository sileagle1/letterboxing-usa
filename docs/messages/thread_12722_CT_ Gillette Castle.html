                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Steve.  Remember us?<br/>
  Gillette's Castle is in my neck of the woods.  Look up the clues <br/>
for "Sherlock's Home" and "Afican Queen".  Sunshine and I checked <br/>
them about 6 weeks ago and all were in good shape but the books were <br/>
full.  We also found a mistery box, do you have a CT quarter in you <br/>
pocket?  Hint, hint!!  If when leaving the park you take a right, <br/>
follow that road down to Rt. 148, don't get on the ferry go left, <br/>
follow Rt. 148 for about 1/2 of a mile to the first 4 way <br/>
intersection and turn right on Joshuatown Road, if you get to Rt. 82 <br/>
you went too far, the Selden Creek letterboxes are in a perserve down <br/>
that road, there are two boxes and some nice views in the small <br/>
perserve.  You may run into Sunshine and I, we haven't found them yet.<br/>
  Do you have a boat?  No one has found our boxes on Selden Island <br/>
yet.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes there are - but would suggest getting them BEFORE they open. The grounds<br/>
are open year round - we were there a couple of weeks ago and it was very<br/>
quiet - but it is a very popular tourist destination in season.<br/>
