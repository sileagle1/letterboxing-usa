<br/>
Built in 1886, the schoolhouse now contains a variety of displays on natural<br/>
history, including live native animals. Features found outside include a<br/>
garden, a pond, a waterfowl feeding area, wildflowers, prairie restoration,<br/>
and an orchard. Self-guiding nature trails are 15, 30, or 60 minutes in<br/>
length. A great place to take the family.<br/>

Clues<br/>
<br/>
Go into the school and take a peek, then go out the back door. Take the<br/>
trail to the right. At the fork, make another right and go through the gate<br/>
that locks. Then another fork, another right. Pass a sign that really isn't<br/>
a sign. Pass the number eleven. When your back is toward the water, look for<br/>
a sawed-off stump on the trail. About 45 paces ahead there is a fallen tree<br/>
with both arms cut off at trails edge. The two arms merge and point to your<br/>
treasure's home.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
