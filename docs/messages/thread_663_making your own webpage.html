&gt; Copy the source file? If I select on a page and copy, I just get the<br/>
&gt;  text... What that procedure if it's not too complicated?<br/>
&gt;  Should I add a link that goes back to the main LbNA page?<br/>

Dear Deborah,<br/>
Once you've found a clue page that is formatted the way you want yours to <br/>
look, just point at it and right-click.  In most browsers, this will give you <br/>
an option to VIEW SOURCE.  This procedure will reveal the code behind the <br/>
formatting of the page.<br/>
<br/>
You can save this source code as an ordinary text file in a text editor such <br/>
as Wordpad.  It is customary to give the file a name ending in the suffix .HTM<br/>
<br/>
Next, try to read through all the gibberish and look for anything that makes <br/>
sense.  The only parts that will make any sense to you, at first, will be the <br/>
name of the letterbox, the instructions, clues, etc.  Fortunately, these are <br/>
virtually the only things you probably need to change to make your own clue <br/>
page!!  So just edit the obvious things, save the file, and then open it up <br/>
in your browser and take a look.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to give this a try, let me know how it works for you.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch<br/>
