&gt;<br/>
&gt;I sent this off-line to Amanda Briles, but decided to share with<br/>
&gt;everyone.  =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;--------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wheee... it was great!  I didn't manage to get out till, before<br/>
&gt;hitting the road home to Seattle on Sunday afternoon, but I just<br/>
&gt;didn't want leave Portland without at least doing one box!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had printed out several sets of clues before leaving home.  So<br/>
&gt;before leaving Portland, I got a Portland map and a bottle of water.<br/>
&gt;I sat in my car pondering the boxes trying to determine which would<br/>
&gt;be the easiest/closest.  I decided on "Who let the dogs out"  =D....<br/>
&gt;as it seemed the shortest drive from where I was (Hadden Island?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a little trouble finding the starting point, and crossed the<br/>
&gt;Freemont Bridge a couple of times more then necessary.  <blush><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was a great hike.  I was wearing jeans and sneakers and a short<br/>
&gt;top with spaghetti straps... Ohhh the bugs LOVED me!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I started off, not sure what lay ahead of me, but eager to give it my<br/>
&gt;best shot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It seems that the High Fire Danger sign is no longer there,  but<br/>
&gt;the `large clearing' was easy enough to spot.  I learned that I<br/>
&gt;wasn't sure what a "snag" was (but knew it when I saw it, thanks to<br/>
&gt;the description).  I backtracked to the stump, but I wasn't exactly<br/>
&gt;sure where to look.  I was poking around the underbrush, wishing I<br/>
&gt;had a walking stick to dig at the leaves... but then all of a sudden,<br/>
&gt;I found Skip staring right at me.  =D<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was so great to find the first box!  I looked over the box at my<br/>
&gt;leisure, looking at all the stamps that were already logged, and the<br/>
&gt;rest of the boxes' contence and labeling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I replaced Skip and continued on.  I found where Rover was supposed<br/>
&gt;to be... too bad I missed the little fellow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I found that I also didn't know what a 'culvert' was (and still don't<br/>
&gt;<g>) and I searched around the wrong tree for a few min, having<br/>
&gt;misidentified the "reinforcing stick".  But just a little ways up the<br/>
&gt;trail I spotted the *correct* stick (no doubt this was the right one<br/>
&gt;this time) and found Fido safe and sound.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The trek between Fido and Spot had me huffing a bit, but I was<br/>
&gt;determined to get the last box, and was having a fun time to boot!<br/>
&gt;The last jaunt to the tree with 6 trunks was longer then I expected<br/>
&gt;and I was concerned that I had missed it or made a wrong turn, but<br/>
&gt;again once I saw it I knew I had the right one (great landmarks!).<br/>
&gt;Spot was enjoying the view from his hiding place  as he peeked over a<br/>
&gt;chunk of bark that was keeping him slightly camouflaged.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;On this last box, I think the "Mosquito Flight Squad" had found me,<br/>
&gt;so I hurried thru this box so I could get on the move again and have<br/>
&gt;my hands free for swatting.  =)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a blast! ... and a nice little workout to boot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Everything was in good shape.  The stamps were a little mucky, so I<br/>
&gt;cleaned them best I could (by stamping the excess ink goo on the last<br/>
&gt;page of my journal numerous times).  The images were very nice and<br/>
&gt;stamped very well.  It was great to get my first look at someone<br/>
&gt;else's carving work, and see a letterbox 'in the field'.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Already looking forward to my next box!<br/>
