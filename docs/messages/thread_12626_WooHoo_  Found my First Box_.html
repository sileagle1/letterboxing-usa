with two of my high school students.  We managed to get in a little <br/>
letterboxing and found the USA Flag box placed by Silver Eagle in <br/>
Zilker Park.  Box was in good shape and had a cool stamp!  On our way <br/>
home, we stopped in Waco at the Texas Ranger Museum and found Silver <br/>
Eagle's Texas Ranger box...again in good shape with a cool stamp!  <br/>
Thanks for an exciting week!<br/>
