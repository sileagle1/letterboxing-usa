<br/>
When I find one, should I keep it a secret and just pass it on, or do I<br/>
"report" it to the group here? How about when I pass it on? Again, tell<br/>
people or keep it a secret?<br/>
<br/>
How about when I create a hitchiker? Do I inform the group of its existence<br/>
and where it is, or do I keep quiet and just let someone find it?  \<br/>
<br/>
How do you count them on a PF ratio? If I find a hitchhiker, I assume I<br/>
count it as another find. Do I also count it as "placed" when i place it<br/>
somewhere, or do I only count hitchhikers I have created and started in my<br/>
"placed" total?<br/>

You could tell when &amp; where you find one, but not where you re-place <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Many people announce the creation of hitchhikers, but do not tell <br/>
where it is first placed, only when.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; How do you count them on a PF ratio? If I find a hitchhiker, I <br/>
assume I<br/>

<br/>
It seems like everyone has their own routine, but I think you only <br/>
count a hitchhiker as a Found. When you create your own, it's a <br/>
Placed. This could be a grey area though, what does everyone else do?<br/>
<br/>
How about boxes that you visit more than once? Are they another Find <br/>
each time? What about boxes you've placed then revisited?   (I <br/>
haven't been counting repeats at all, but should I?)<br/>
<br/>
Also, I would think it would be a very nice gesture if you were to <br/>
find a hitchhiker with a full book, that you return it to the placer, <br/>
if possible.<br/>
