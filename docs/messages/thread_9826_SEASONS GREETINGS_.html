                    <div class="plaintext-content">Happy Holidays to everyone!  I know it's belated for Ramadan/Eid and<br/>

No white Christmas in Portland, Oregon, I'm happy to say.  In fact, the<br/>
onslaught of rain that was predicted is nonexistent so far.  There is a<br/>
bright disc in the sky that looks reminiscent of the sun, even!  Dry,<br/>
cold and relatively safe weather here in the Rose City. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway.  Have a safe one.  Much merriness to all!<br/>

Belated for Yule, but certainly in time for Festivus.  If none of the<br/>
preceeding apply to you, have a great day and ...<br/>
<br/>
... best wishes for the coming year -- may you find many boxes under your <br/>
trees ...<br/>

to Portland then had to chain up on Mt Hood on the way to Redmond <br/>
where we had a partially white Christmas at a friend's house. On the <br/>
way back home today we saw a pickup loaded with snow and shovels - I <br/>
guess someone in Portland was getting a white Christmas regardless <br/>
of the weather!<br/>
