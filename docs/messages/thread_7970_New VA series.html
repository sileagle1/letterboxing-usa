Oakton and Vienna, Virginia<br/>
Fairfax County<br/>
Boxes placed September 25, 2002<br/>
by Daughter of the Old Dominion<br/>
<br/>
This series is about sporting activities in some parks in Oakton and<br/>
Vienna, Virginia.  The directions are given so that you can easily <br/>
drive from one park to the next.   <br/>
<br/>
LETTERBOX 1.  This is a mini-letterbox. <br/>
Oak Marr Recreation Center and Golf Complex<br/>
3200 Jermantown Road, Oakton, Virginia<br/>
Restroom facilities inside the REC center.<br/>
Dogs on leash OK on outside paths.<br/>
<br/>
At Oak Marr Recreation Center you can swim in the heated Olympic-sized<br/>
indoor pool, dive in the diving complex, play racquetball, walleyball,<br/>
or use the fitness center.  At the adjoining Oak Marr Golf Complex, <br/>
you can play on a 9-hole golf course, or practice at the driving <br/>
range or putting greens.   For more information see: <br/>
http://www.co.fairfax.va.us/parks/rec/omrec.htm.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to park:  From Route 66, take the exit for Route 123 <br/>
north.  Turn NNW onto Jermantown Road.  The Oak Marr Recreation <br/>
Center and Golf Complex is on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to letterbox:  Park in any parking lot.  Walk back to<br/>
Jermantown Road.  At a bearing of 50 degrees, walk on the sidewalk <br/>
past six streetlight poles.  Turn onto the paved path just ahead.  <br/>
After about a five-minute walk, the pavement ends but the path <br/>
continues to a T.  Take the west path.  Soon the path will hug the <br/>
black fence for 50 steps.  When it no longer hugs the fence, take 35 <br/>
steps.  Your treasure will be at the base of a "three for one" tree.  <br/>
Don't let the neighbors see you!<br/>
<br/>
LETTERBOX 2.  This is a mini-letterbox.<br/>
Blake Lane Park<br/>
Blake Lane, Vienna, Virginia<br/>
No facilities.  Dogs on leash OK.<br/>
<br/>
This small neighborhood park is basically just soccer fields and a dog<br/>
park. Be very discreet, particularly if you are there during soccer<br/>
games since there may be kids playing on the paths.    <br/>
<br/>
Directions to park:  From the Oak Marr Recreation Center, turn left <br/>
onto Jermantown Road.  Cross Route 123.  At the next traffic light, <br/>
the road changes names to Blake Lane.  Do not turn - stay straight on <br/>
this road.  Soon on your right, on the corner of Blake and Bushman <br/>
Drive, you will see a grassy field.  Slow down because Blake Lane <br/>
Park is the next right and it comes on you fast.  There is a big sign <br/>
but you can't see it much in advance of the turn because the trees on <br/>
Blake Lane obscure the view.<br/>
<br/>
Directions to letterbox:  After parking your car, follow the Dog Park<br/>
sign.  At the first railroad tie descending, turn NW and enter the<br/>
little wooded area.  You will immediately see a slab of broken<br/>
concrete.  Sit on this slab and consult your compass. The box is under<br/>
the north end of the slab.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LETTERBOX 3.  <br/>
Nottoway Park <br/>
9601 Courthouse Road, Vienna, Virginia<br/>
There are restroom facilities and water fountains.  Dogs on leash OK <br/>
on paths. <br/>
<br/>
At Nottoway Park you can play tennis, basketball or volleyball, <br/>
garden, picnic, work out on the fitness trail, or enjoy the quiet <br/>
solitude of the nature paths.  There are ball fields and soccer <br/>
fields and a playground.  The Fairfax Connector Bike Trail goes <br/>
through a corner of the park and right next door is another dog park. <br/>
For more information see http://www.co.fairfax.va.us/parks/omp.htm#25<br/>
<br/>
Directions to park:  From Blake Lane Park, turn onto Blake Lane.  At<br/>
traffic light, turn onto Sutton Road. At flashing light, turn right on<br/>
Courthouse Road.  The park is on the right. <br/>
<br/>
Directions to letterbox:  After entering the park, proceed past the<br/>
volleyball court to the left parking lot. Park.  At the southeast<br/>
corner, follow the bike trail to the conspicuous path, by a trashcan,<br/>
into the woods.  Cross the wooden bridge.  Immediately take the path <br/>
to the left, crossing the ditch to stay left.  Keep looking left, 10 <br/>
yards deep, until you see a forked path that is crossed by a fallen <br/>
tree. Carefully standing on the fallen tree, go towards the treetop, <br/>
stepping over the first crossed limb.  Stop before second limb.  Look <br/>
at your feet!<br/>
<br/>
To complete the circuit, return to the bridge and walk in the original<br/>
direction out of the woods to the paved path.  Turn towards third base<br/>
and you will return to the parking lot.<br/>
