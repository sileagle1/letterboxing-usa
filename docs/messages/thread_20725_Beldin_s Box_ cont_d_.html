                    <div class="plaintext-content">Beldin awoke with a start. Beldin stirred from his dream and sat upright. <br/>
Beldin rolled out from under a rock and looked around. Beldin..<br/>
<br/>
Beldin!<br/>
<br/>
That was his name. He certainly knew that. Why wouldn't he know his name? <br/>
It was his own name.<br/>
<br/>
But what was this place? How did he come to be here? He grimaced at the <br/>
effort required to muster these few questions, and his voice sailed <br/>
unanswered into the valley below.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm definitely Bourne.<br/>
I'm also definitely Kane.<br/>
<br/>
Fire, synapses, fire! He commanded his brain to begin providing answers, <br/>
but there was no clarity, no reason, no comprehension.<br/>
<br/>
Wiggle your big toe.<br/>
Wiggle your big toe<br/>
<br/>
He looked again at his surroundings. A rock. A tree, then another. A <br/>
stream. A hill behind him. A colorless landscape in dusk's long shadows.<br/>
<br/>
Why this place?<br/>
<br/>
Why here? Why now?<br/>
<br/>
Beldin remembered this: In that twilight state between sleep and awake, the <br/>
mind makes its own reality. And then dreams can become real. Or is that <br/>
reality can become a dream?<br/>
<br/>
Confused . Awake. Dreaming. Dead, possibly. Beldin bounced from option to <br/>
option, but the rules of logic seemed no longer to apply. Each was <br/>
possible, each was equally and completely implausible.<br/>
<br/>
If you know the number of the person you'd like to reach,<br/>
press pound now.<br/>
<br/>
Such is the case with ontological breakdowns, he mused. Being and not being <br/>
there. As Lao-Tzu said, "All things are born of being; being is born of <br/>
non-being."<br/>
<br/>
It's just, it's just, it's just,<br/>
Just like being there.<br/>
<br/>
Beldin wondered why quantum mechanics and words of great philosophers came <br/>
so easily, while explanations for his immediate predicament were non-existent.<br/>
<br/>
Speak, memory!<br/>
<br/>
Beldin sensed that the key to curing his complete neural cataclysm was <br/>
waiting to be unlocked in his own memory. In dreams begin responsibilities. <br/>
In memories begin understanding. Beldin needed to think. Think and remember.<br/>
<br/>
Ah, the key at last came to him in a white hot flash  Beldin would <br/>
teleport back to some place in memory, return to a familiar place, and then <br/>
all would become clear.<br/>
<br/>
That's it, that's all. But what was the first thing he remembered, or the <br/>
last thing? Or had all his memories been erased, wiped clean, overwritten <br/>
with bits?<br/>
<br/>
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use,<br/>
which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.<br/>
<br/>
The beach! Beldin remembered a beach, the beach, the beach near the <br/>
islands. This miserable state of suspended existence was more than he could <br/>
tolerate, and if he could only return to the beach, as faded and distant as <br/>
it was in his memory.<br/>
<br/>
Beldin faltered, considering the alternatives. Then, with resolve, he <br/>
closed his eyes and spoke in a firm voice:<br/>
<br/>
Whenever you find yourself in doubt<br/>
Return to where you started out.<br/>
<br/>
The wizard slowly opened his eyes, and took in his new surroundings. A <br/>
wooden sign read "NOSE WINNING" in faded letters, which, although it made <br/>
no sense to Beldin, he did not question. Any absurdities in his world were <br/>
most likely due to the breakdown in his perceptual faculties.<br/>
<br/>
There, the grass, and the trail heading northeast  these seemed at once <br/>
familiar and strange. Beldin was drawn up the trail, and he gave no fight <br/>
to the allure. He followed the trail for a ways as greens and yellows <br/>
swirled just at the edges of his vision, until he suddenly stopped, <br/>
startled by a sudden division. The road on which he was traveling turned in <br/>
one direction, but the path that he was following turned in another. This <br/>
again seemed both familiar and strange. Beldin, following instinct, choose <br/>
the path.<br/>
<br/>
Beldin felt tired. "I think I'll rest for a while and worry about my <br/>
mission and the rest of my adventure some other century." Those words came <br/>
automatically, and Beldin was taken aback by the ease with which the words <br/>
flowed.<br/>
<br/>
He trudged ahead. There, on the left, was a familiar old stump in the <br/>
woods. It had grown, hadn't it? Or was it always ten feet tall? How could <br/>
it be familiar when it was so foreign? This mighty fallen tree on the <br/>
ground, too, with its twin limbs  was it truly familiar, or was it just <br/>
that he wanted to see objects and places that were known to him? Was he <br/>
merely fabricating memories out of gossamer-thin thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Beldin made his way to the bare stump, and saw the way he was meant to <br/>
follow. A log on the ground pointed to the safety of the rocks. His energy <br/>
was fading fast. "This looks older than I do, doesn't it?" he mused. "Oh <br/>
my!" he gasped as he settled in. "How does one ever imagine getting out of <br/>
here?"<br/>
<br/>
