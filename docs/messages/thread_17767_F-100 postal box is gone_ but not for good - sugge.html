&gt; Well, it seems that the F-100 box is gone. I know who mailed it out <br/>
prior to Christmas and who did not get it (that should have), so I <br/>
will be carving a replica that will be sent to the place it was <br/>
supposed to visit before going missing. This is an example of why <br/>
the 'delivery confirmation' is such a good idea &amp; it doesn't cost <br/>
much. Having that number of the package allows the post office to see <br/>
where it is/went. I have no control over how the postal boxes are <br/>
mailed once they leave my home, but I do request that anyone sending <br/>
off a box of my creation gets a delivery confirmation (&amp; I'll do the <br/>
same for any boxes I pass along). Look for this box to start it's <br/>
rounds again soon!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If anyone is on the list and has moved in the past year or no <br/>
longer wants to be on the list, just let me know.<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

Since there is no guarantee that this won't happen again, I <br/>
suggest you scan the F100, F500 and p100 stamp images and <br/>
put them in the Files section so anyone qualifying can<br/>
print them out.  That way there is no chance of losing<br/>
them again and no waiting for snail mail.  If you don't<br/>
want to do this I guess I will email you with my address<br/>
and take my chances, since I value your stamps.<br/>
