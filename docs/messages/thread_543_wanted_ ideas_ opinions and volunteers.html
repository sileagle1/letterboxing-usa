                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Friends,<br/>
I've recently heard from a lot of people who would like to see some sort of <br/>
'What's New' section added to the website.  Something that would list newly <br/>
placed letterboxes, and serve as a forum for sharing letterboxing <br/>
experiences, tips, opinions, anecdotes, newsbits, photos, etc. with the rest <br/>
of the world (outside our Talk List).<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a good idea, and would like to hear other people's opinions.  <br/>
If you have any ideas about what we could include in this section or would <br/>
like to submit photos, stories, etc. please step forward and share what you <br/>
have to offer with the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
Tom Cooch suggested the name LETTERBOXING UNDERGROUND.  This sort of appealed <br/>
to me, so I threw together a possible logotype for consideration.  To see it, <br/>
go to the LbNA website (www.letterboxing.org) and click on the word KIDS.  On <br/>
the Kids page, click on the Owl.  (of course, I'll move the link to a more <br/>
appropriate location when it's ready for general release.)<br/>
<br/>
Don't be bashfull... speak up if you have ideas!!!<br/>
Thanks!!!<br/>

I think the layout for the LbNA newsletter looks terrific! I can't <br/>
believe how fast you put it all together. Way to go!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, it had been a while since I clicked on any of the Pooh <br/>
characters on the Kids' Page, and discovered some enjoyable links.<br/>
<br/>
As for content, I bet we'll get lots of suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
A carving tip of the week (month) ... maybe Susan Davis could edit <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of photos .. Is there someone with a color scanner who would <br/>
volunteer to accept photos from those of us not digitalized?<br/>
<br/>
Certainly lists of boxes placed and boxes found during the month. <br/>
<br/>
A letterboxing adventure of the month (maybe more than one, as they <br/>
occur)<br/>
<br/>
An interesting/unusual clue of the month<br/>
<br/>
PF quotient page ????  - not sure if there is really enough content <br/>
here to validate this.<br/>
<br/>
A Lonely Boxes page - boxes placed but not yet found - who will be <br/>
the first to find the Ohio Mystery Box?<br/>
<br/>
A LbNA members/addresses page.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, everyone ... keep the suggestions coming.<br/>

As I said earlier, this just keeps getting better and better - KUDOS to<br/>
you and to all involved.<br/>
<br/>
As for ideas for the "Whats New?" section:<br/>
<br/>
Certainly this would be a good place to announce new boxes. <br/>
<br/>
It might be a place to announce successful finds, perhaps by showing<br/>
postcards memorializing this (i.e., a postcard with both letterbox and<br/>
finder's stamps, with date, comments, etc, scanned in...<br/>
<br/>
How about "Letterboxing Adventures", much like Thom's recent foray into<br/>
the brambles...and the others from Graham and Adrian, as they are off<br/>
gathering dozens of boxes in an afternoon (envy!!).<br/>
<br/>
I like Tom's "tip of the month" idea. How about interesting, related <br/>
links when they are found?<br/>
<br/>
Is there any interest in a "Who's Who" kind of bio page - sort of like<br/>
the "welcome wagon" e-mail that was circulating a while back. Might have<br/>
name, photo, personal stamp, short bio, whatever anyone wants to<br/>
include.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I like this idea very much, and, you've made such a good start<br/>
on the web page. Although, I admit, when first reading the random<br/>
characters that you used to illustrate format, I wondered if it was a<br/>
coded letterbox clue. As I've been feeling a tad obtuse these, I am glad<br/>
to recognize that it wasn't so!<br/>
