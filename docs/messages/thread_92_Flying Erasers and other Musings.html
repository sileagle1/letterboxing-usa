haven't checked my mail in quite a while.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't mean to create such waves with my "official letterbox" post.  It was<br/>
kind of a joke, actually.  And to set the record straight, Eric Mings DID<br/>
visit my box like a couple months ago.  Besides, it would be really<br/>
hippocritical to actually be genuinely upset because I have yet to find MY<br/>
first box.  (though I planned to visit Deborah's in Dec.  Perhaps there'll be<br/>
a NEW Super Special IMPROVED turville point box, eh?)<br/>
<br/>
Lynn- I don't think Evanston, IL's letterbox is on the way to Ohio, I guess it<br/>
depends on what direction you're coming from.  Though It's less than a mile<br/>
from Chicago, and may I mention since you're interested in art how excellant<br/>
the ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO is?  Yeah, buddy!  My big bro goes to the School<br/>
of the Art Institute of Chi-town.  So when you come to see his work you can<br/>
find my box!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Californians- My box is very local.  It's only like a mile away from my house,<br/>
so it's easy to get to.<br/>
