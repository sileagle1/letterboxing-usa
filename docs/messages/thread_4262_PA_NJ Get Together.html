It's great to see so much interest and it will be wonderful seeing new and <br/>
known faces!!<br/>
My understanding was that Brian was thinking of an evening get together not <br/>
a day time gather, hence my suggestion of boxing during the day and getting <br/>
together to eat and visit at an Inn.<br/>
Raubsville is not a high flow spot and they have three different rooms <br/>
depending on our groups size.<br/>
We have a lot of time to put together what everyone would like to do and <br/>
reach a happy agreement!<br/>
Look forward to seeing everyone!!<br/>
See Joy<br/>

Raubsville<br/>
<br/>
That was my understanding as well.  I've gotten most of the boxes in that area,<br/>
but if anyone was willing to head towards the Jersey side to hunt there, I'm<br/>
game.<br/>
