If I were, I might go find them all but not claim the prize, so whoever gets the boxes and prize will more likely become an avid boxer.  But at this late time, I'm sure you already decided and the first finder of all is done.  I'm wondering how the respiratory dept. knows about boxing and how many boxers work with you.<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Letterboxing at Work Today! - You gotta read this<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  In honor of Respiratory Therapy week, the hospital I work in<br/>
  has set up a series of Letterboxes throughout the Hospital -<br/>
  complete with "Letterboxing" clues posted on the board in <br/>
  the respiratory dept.<br/>
<br/>
  So, I've had the joy of letterboxing while at work today! <br/>
  There is a prize for the first person to find them all.<br/>
  So .... what do you think? Should I be fair and give someone else<br/>
  a shot at winning the prize or do I go and scoop 'em all up as fast <br/>
  as I can???? Heh, heh, heh ...<br/>
