Thanks, just glad I could help. If you want to hear from people that live in<br/>
the area you could try asking this question on the Rocky Mt. List. I'm not<br/>
sure if A-Bear still participates, but she was a great source of information<br/>
when my brother and I visited, and even put together a small mini-meet for<br/>

I miss my hiking and letterboxing in Idaho.  There are lots of amazing hikes out there and some beautiful scenery.  I'm afraid I won't be tons of help though as it has been five years since I moved to the UK.<br/>
<br/>
When I was letterboxing in Idaho, hardly anybody was doing it.  Actually A-Bear and I were the only ones for about two years.  So we tended to keep our boxes fairly simple to encourage people to give it a go.  We had some lovely spots though, and I'm sure you can make more of a go of them.  I'm not sure, obviously, on the status of my boxes.  I have tried to update the status if I've received reports of them missing.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Does anyone have recommendations for some good hikes with letterboxes in<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Idaho?  I'm just starting to do some research, but would appreciate any<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; advice from people that have hiked/boxed in the area.  We prefer hikes in<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the 3-15 mile range.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
