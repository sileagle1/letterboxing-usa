evening so CardinalMom, the kids, and I took the opportunity to hunt <br/>
a few boxes in the Chillicothe area.  We found the Great Seal <br/>
letterbox first - it's in good shape but needs aome new log sheets.  <br/>
Then we found Monkey Shines after a fairly intensive search - good <br/>
hide Franzsolo!  We looked again for Kick Up Your Heels but sadly it <br/>
was still not to be found.  After that, we changed locations and <br/>
began looking for Eerie, Eerie, Eerie.  Imagine our surprize at <br/>
finding Yoctangee Park which we didn't even have clues for!  Almost <br/>
as good as finding a hitchhiker - maybe better!  We finished up by <br/>
finally locating Eerie, Eerie, Eerie.  All the boxes are in good <br/>
condition.  Loads of fun!  Keep up the good work folks!<br/>
