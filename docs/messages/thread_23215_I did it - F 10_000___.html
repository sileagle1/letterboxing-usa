                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, am I ever delighted to be able to report that I reached my F <br/>
10,000 goal a few days early! ( I decided that I'd better get it done <br/>
before April Fool's Day just so that no one would think it was a <br/>
joke!) Anyway, Pete and I went out after church last Sunday afternoon <br/>
to finish up a few letterboxing "loose ends" remaining for us in RI. <br/>
Monday I had a dental appointment, plus volunteer work to do at <br/>
church ( rearranging the big floral arrangements to bring smaller <br/>
bouquets to shut-ins in nursing homes and such), so I decided to make <br/>
Tuesday my big "CT wrap-up boxing day". I'd already done pretty much <br/>
all the nearer CT boxes, so I got an early start to the "other side <br/>
of the river" to make a big sweep through Wallingford, Woodbridge and <br/>
Naugatuck. By hiking over 20 miles that day on various trails in <br/>
different areas, I finally got all the boxes along the Beacon Cap <br/>
ridge, plus many more! <br/>
<br/>
That evening back in RI at Polish Club, I asked one of my friends <br/>
there (now known as "Hibiscus" for the prevalence of that flower <br/>
everwhere we went last year when I first introduced her to <br/>
letterboxing in Florida!) to join me the next day for a quick swing <br/>
through Cape Cod. We got a rather late start, but picked up quite a <br/>
few boxes out there Wednesday afternoon, bringing Irene to F100 near <br/>
sunset at "Wychmere Harbor" in Harwich, and me to F9999 at "Holidays: <br/>
March" nearby! I was going to leave F10,000 for the special <br/>
commemorative box that Pete was planning to plant for me back in RI, <br/>
but Irene and I stayed over at a motel in South Yarmouth, so the next <br/>
morning we just had to go out to the nearby "Year of the Dog" <br/>
letterbox! "Archimedes' Screw" did such a wonderful job on this <br/>
stamp, logbook, and story (including the symbolic meaning of the year <br/>
as a time for less selfishness and increased social awareness of the <br/>
less powerful among us) that I was absolutely delighted to have this <br/>
box as my 10,000th find!  <br/>
<br/>
So, afterwards we two "old ladies" in our 50's and 60's swung up high <br/>
into the air like happy children on the nearby swings! Then we went <br/>
down to the Dunkin Donuts and onward up the Cape for a few more boxes <br/>
nearer the shore before heading back towards Hyannis for our <br/>
celebratory Chinese lunch at the Cape Cod Super Buffet - our <br/>
traditional letterboxing favorite! We even got to meet up <br/>
with "Archimedes' Screw" later that afternnon after school to tell <br/>
her how happy we were with our letterboxing adventures, and then we<br/>
headed back to RI while viewing an absolutely gorgeous sunset and <br/>
playing loud polka music - what a blast!<br/>
<br/>
So, once again I just want to thank everyone who made this <br/>
accomplishment possible. I think it really is a big deal for North <br/>
American letterboxing, not only to have a supposed 20,000+ plants <br/>
listed as available to find "on-line", but to actually have a real <br/>
live person who went out "on trail" and found over 10,000 of them - <br/>
and has the many many books full of stamps to prove it! Actually, I <br/>
could have said that I reached F10,000 quite a while ago, if I <br/>
counted all the multiple stamps in boxes, partial boxes, boxes listed <br/>
as missing before either of us could find them that we searched for <br/>
anyway, hitchers we found multiple times, etc., but I prefer keeping <br/>
count the way we describe in an interview done with us several years <br/>
ago ( see "About Us" on our webpage), so I'm just really glad to be <br/>
finally reaching this landmark number now!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch,<br/>

10,000 goal a few days early! ( I decided that I'd better get it done <br/>
before April Fool's Day just so that no one would think it was a <br/>
joke!) Anyway, Pete and I went out after church last Sunday afternoon <br/>
to finish up a few letterboxing "loose ends" remaining for us in RI. <br/>
Monday I had a dental appointment, plus volunteer work to do at <br/>
church ( rearranging the big floral arrangements to bring smaller <br/>
bouquets to shut-ins in nursing homes and such), so I decided to make <br/>
Tuesday my big "CT wrap-up boxing day". I'd already done pretty much <br/>
all the nearer CT boxes, so I got an early start to the "other side <br/>
of the river" to make a big sweep through Wallingford, Woodbridge and <br/>
Naugatuck. By hiking over 20 miles that day on various trails in <br/>
different areas, I finally got all the boxes along the Beacon Cap <br/>
ridge, plus many more! <br/>
<br/>
That evening back in RI at Polish Club, I asked one of my friends <br/>
there (now known as "Hibiscus" for the prevalence of that flower <br/>
everwhere we went last year when I first introduced her to <br/>
letterboxing in Florida!) to join me the next day for a quick swing <br/>
through Cape Cod. We got a rather late start, but picked up quite a <br/>
few boxes out there Wednesday afternoon, bringing Irene to F100 near <br/>
sunset at "Wychmere Harbor" in Harwich, and me to F9999 at "Holidays: <br/>
March" nearby! I was going to leave F10,000 for the special <br/>
commemorative box that Pete was planning to plant for me back in RI, <br/>
but Irene and I stayed over at a motel in South Yarmouth, so the next <br/>
morning we just had to go out to the nearby "Year of the Dog" <br/>
letterbox! "Archimedes' Screw" did such a wonderful job on this <br/>
stamp, logbook, and story (including the symbolic meaning of the year <br/>
as a time for less selfishness and increased social awareness of the <br/>
less powerful among us) that I was absolutely delighted to have this <br/>
box as my 10,000th find!  <br/>
<br/>
So, afterwards we two "old ladies" in our 50's and 60's swung up high <br/>
into the air like happy children on the nearby swings! Then we went <br/>
down to the Dunkin Donuts and onward up the Cape for a few more boxes <br/>
nearer the shore before heading back towards Hyannis for our <br/>
celebratory Chinese lunch at the Cape Cod Super Buffet - our <br/>
traditional letterboxing favorite! We even got to meet up <br/>
with "Archimedes' Screw" later that afternnon after school to tell <br/>
her how happy we were with our letterboxing adventures, and then we<br/>
headed back to RI while viewing an absolutely gorgeous sunset and <br/>
playing loud polka music - what a blast!<br/>
<br/>
So, once again I just want to thank everyone who made this <br/>
accomplishment possible. I think it really is a big deal for North <br/>
American letterboxing, not only to have a supposed 20,000+ plants <br/>
listed as available to find "on-line", but to actually have a real <br/>
live person who went out "on trail" and found over 10,000 of them - <br/>
and has the many many books full of stamps to prove it! Actually, I <br/>
could have said that I reached F10,000 quite a while ago, if I <br/>
counted all the multiple stamps in boxes, partial boxes, boxes listed <br/>
as missing before either of us could find them that we searched for <br/>
anyway, hitchers we found multiple times, etc., but I prefer keeping <br/>
count the way we describe in an interview done with us several years <br/>
ago ( see "About Us" on our webpage), so I'm just really glad to be <br/>
finally reaching this landmark number now!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch,<br/>

Congratulations! and thank you! I needed a good excuse to go get <br/>

Come do a sweep of Jersey again soon; I miss seeing your stamp in the <br/>

I hope you'll be able to swing back down to Texas one<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You're my hero, Wanda. The enthusiasm and enjoyment that characterizes   <br/>
the way you embrace this hobby makes us all look good. I am in awe of<br/>
how you have found so many boxes, yet always take the time to write<br/>
thoughtful comments in each of their logs. It is such a pleasure and<br/>
honor to know you. Archimedes' Screw and I are working on some<br/>
contributions for F15,000.<br/>
Hope to see you back on the Cape trails soon,<br/>

&gt; Well, am I ever delighted to be able to report that I reached my F <br/>
&gt; 10,000 goal a few days early! ( I decided that I'd better get it done <br/>
&gt; before April Fool's Day just so that no one would think it was a <br/>
&gt; joke!) Anyway, Pete and I went out after church last Sunday afternoon <br/>
&gt; to finish up a few letterboxing "loose ends" remaining for us in RI. <br/>
&gt; Monday I had a dental appointment, plus volunteer work to do at <br/>
&gt; church ( rearranging the big floral arrangements to bring smaller <br/>
&gt; bouquets to shut-ins in nursing homes and such), so I decided to make <br/>
&gt; Tuesday my big "CT wrap-up boxing day". I'd already done pretty much <br/>
&gt; all the nearer CT boxes, so I got an early start to the "other side <br/>
&gt; of the river" to make a big sweep through Wallingford, Woodbridge and <br/>
&gt; Naugatuck. By hiking over 20 miles that day on various trails in <br/>
&gt; different areas, I finally got all the boxes along the Beacon Cap <br/>
&gt; ridge, plus many more! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That evening back in RI at Polish Club, I asked one of my friends <br/>
&gt; there (now known as "Hibiscus" for the prevalence of that flower <br/>
&gt; everwhere we went last year when I first introduced her to <br/>
&gt; letterboxing in Florida!) to join me the next day for a quick swing <br/>
&gt; through Cape Cod. We got a rather late start, but picked up quite a <br/>
&gt; few boxes out there Wednesday afternoon, bringing Irene to F100 near <br/>
&gt; sunset at "Wychmere Harbor" in Harwich, and me to F9999 at "Holidays: <br/>
&gt; March" nearby! I was going to leave F10,000 for the special <br/>
&gt; commemorative box that Pete was planning to plant for me back in RI, <br/>
&gt; but Irene and I stayed over at a motel in South Yarmouth, so the next <br/>
&gt; morning we just had to go out to the nearby "Year of the Dog" <br/>
&gt; letterbox! "Archimedes' Screw" did such a wonderful job on this <br/>
&gt; stamp, logbook, and story (including the symbolic meaning of the year <br/>
&gt; as a time for less selfishness and increased social awareness of the <br/>
&gt; less powerful among us) that I was absolutely delighted to have this <br/>
&gt; box as my 10,000th find!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, afterwards we two "old ladies" in our 50's and 60's swung up high <br/>
&gt; into the air like happy children on the nearby swings! Then we went <br/>
&gt; down to the Dunkin Donuts and onward up the Cape for a few more boxes <br/>
&gt; nearer the shore before heading back towards Hyannis for our <br/>
&gt; celebratory Chinese lunch at the Cape Cod Super Buffet - our <br/>
&gt; traditional letterboxing favorite! We even got to meet up <br/>
&gt; with "Archimedes' Screw" later that afternnon after school to tell <br/>
&gt; her how happy we were with our letterboxing adventures, and then we<br/>
&gt; headed back to RI while viewing an absolutely gorgeous sunset and <br/>
&gt; playing loud polka music - what a blast!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, once again I just want to thank everyone who made this <br/>
&gt; accomplishment possible. I think it really is a big deal for North <br/>
&gt; American letterboxing, not only to have a supposed 20,000+ plants <br/>
&gt; listed as available to find "on-line", but to actually have a real <br/>
&gt; live person who went out "on trail" and found over 10,000 of them - <br/>
&gt; and has the many many books full of stamps to prove it! Actually, I <br/>
&gt; could have said that I reached F10,000 quite a while ago, if I <br/>
&gt; counted all the multiple stamps in boxes, partial boxes, boxes listed <br/>
&gt; as missing before either of us could find them that we searched for <br/>
&gt; anyway, hitchers we found multiple times, etc., but I prefer keeping <br/>
&gt; count the way we describe in an interview done with us several years <br/>
&gt; ago ( see "About Us" on our webpage), so I'm just really glad to be <br/>
&gt; finally reaching this landmark number now!<br/>
