<br/>
As this series begins to wind down, we have a little something for those of you who can't get to these parts...<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has a favorite... Do you sneak in to the kitchen at 3AM and slather a bowl of vanilla ice cream with hot fudge and crushed Thin Mints?   Do you down a whole sleeve of Trefoils with a cup of tea?   Do you double dose on Double Dutch?<br/>
<br/>
Well let the world know... Cast your vote for your favorite Girl Scout Cookie today!<br/>
