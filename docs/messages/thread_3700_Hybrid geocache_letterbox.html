I just posted my first letterbox.  It also happens to<br/>
be a previously established geocache that I put out<br/>
several weeks ago.  In my read of the few letterbox<br/>
offerings for southern ohio, there were no GPS like<br/>
instructions... I concluded that this older sport<br/>
might like a low technology approach to "finding". <br/>
Hence, I wrote up a description that requires some<br/>
clue solving (but does not require a GPS) to get to<br/>
the box via a different route than the geocache route.<br/>
 What do some of you think about these issues?<br/>

&gt;  What do some of you think about these [geocache/letterbox] issues?<br/>
<br/>
Hi Rick,<br/>
<br/>
My opinions are probably in the minority, but here goes ...<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, I don't see it as a "low tech" vs "high tech" thing.  While<br/>
a good deal of technology goes into _building_ a GPS receiver, I find it <br/>
takes about the same technical skill on the part of the _user_ to use <br/>
as a toaster or television, so I think the "high tech" vibe when<br/>
referring to GPS receivers is a bit of a perception myth.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I don't see it as a "low tech" vs "high tech" thing :-)  I<br/>
see it as an intellectual challenge thing.  There are letterboxes that<br/>
require "high" technology to find.  There are geocaches that require<br/>
nothing more than a topo map and compass to find.  And verse visa.<br/>
Many in both pastimes require simply following the directions.<br/>
So again, I see the "technology" thing only as a false dilemma.  The<br/>
tools to find these things, whether they be GPS receivers, maps,<br/>
online database, or knowledge of 18th century Turkic literature,<br/>
are all about the same on the "technology" scale -- it just comes down<br/>
to a matter of what tools and skills people enjoy using, or what<br/>
tools and skills people want to learn to use.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, any style of clue, simple, puzzling, GPS, etc., is welcome<br/>
in letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>

Yikes.. Randy,<br/>
<br/>
I sure am glad you don't plant them down here in Florida ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I have a hard enough time keeping up on contemporary American literature :-)<br/>

Thanks for the reply!  I was trying to make some sense out of your <br/>
Ohio challenge and had searched for all your posts.  (Many)  I got to <br/>
the most recent and found it was a reply to me.  (Surprise!)<br/>
<br/>
I have moved into slightly challenging "museum and a hike" geocaches <br/>
for my last two.  Others seem to like them.  I also like the idea of <br/>
letterboxing.  Getting some regular letterboxes out seems like a good <br/>
idea.  Making the geocaches I have put out dual use also sounds like <br/>
a reasonable idea, as long as I am not upsetting the apple cart.  I <br/>
have not decided about having a second set of GPS less clues for each <br/>
of the boxes especially since it would be easier for the letterboxer <br/>
to just use the GPS clues at www.geocaching.com.  Main goal for now <br/>
is to get some Ohio letterboxes listed so that letterbox hunters can <br/>
have a target when they visit.<br/>
