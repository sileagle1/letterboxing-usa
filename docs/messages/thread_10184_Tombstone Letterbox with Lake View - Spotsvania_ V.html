                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are on route 208 coming from route #1, Thornburg.  Go to the <br/>
signs to Lake Anna State Park, Route 601, take a right. Go about 2 to <br/>
4 miles until you read the Lake Anna entrance on the left (Route # <br/>
7000)<br/>
After you go past the gate, it is 1.7 miles till you take a left past <br/>
the Ranger's Station.  Drive down the road until you reach a small <br/>
parking lot on the right.  You are looking for Mill Pond Trail.  The <br/>
lot is small, so park and walk across to the trail to the left, it <br/>
should say "Adopt a Trail Girl Scouts #618".  You are now beginning <br/>
the search as it was wintering and snowing the night before, we only <br/>
wandered maybe a half a mile or so at least until the first <br/>
complaints from the old folks that we were too far away and they <br/>
needed to chain smoke and slow down.  Okay just kidding.  Your will <br/>
see an elbow tree on the right, a Y tree and some bird houses for <br/>
feeding.  You the pass two logs down a hill and once you come to a <br/>
clearing instead of continuing on the horse trail, go to the Hikers <br/>
Only Trail straight ahead.  Walk on for 100 or so yards approx. You <br/>
will have to step over fallen trees and stuff. You will walk along <br/>
until the hill starts sloping down.  On your left you will see a tree <br/>
with an arrow.  Continue on the path until you get to the BIG rock on <br/>
the right about 30 steps, you can't miss it.  Go 20 paces towards a <br/>
rock that is sticking up - The Tombstone Rock - to the right there is <br/>
a tree (big Oakish) with a tiny knob.  The Tombstone letterbox is 2 <br/>
and a half feet from the base of the tree in the ground with a rock <br/>
on top.  If you are looking at the lake, it is at 3 o'clock facing <br/>
the "cool looking" house.<br/>
Live long and enjoy walking....From the Lake Womyn <br/>
