The Franconia Ridge Bookends were removed by the AMC a<br/>
couple of summers back. I seem to recall a post on<br/>
this list about it. <br/>
<br/>
I haven't heard anything about Old Man in quite a<br/>
while, but I was there not long after he fell from the<br/>
mountain last May. The book was almost completely<br/>
full, but the box was very well hidden, so I'd say<br/>
there's a good chance it's still there. <br/>
<br/>
I noticed that neither of these boxes are listed on<br/>
the site anymore, and I don'r remember the original<br/>
planters, so I can't help you there, sorry.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Old Man was there (the box) on Labor Day 2003.  The walkway had <br/>
only a couple of visitors, not only because tourist places get that <br/>
ghost town look on Labor Day weekend, but because there isn't a <br/>
whole heck of a lot to look at there now.  The log book was indeed <br/>
quite full.  I tried to contact the placer.  I offered to adopt the <br/>
box if no one came forward (as either the owner or another adoptive <br/>
parent living closer than RI), and I'll bring supplies when we go <br/>
back, but that will probably not be until the end of summer or <br/>
during our honeymoon in Sept.  I hope anyone who can give an update <br/>
will keep us posted.  I offered to adopt the box because around the<br/>
time of the switch to the "new" LbNA site, the clues were removed to <br/>
many boxes unless the box was actively maintained.  It's a nice walk <br/>
(Pemi trail, I think) even without the Old Man to look at.<br/>
