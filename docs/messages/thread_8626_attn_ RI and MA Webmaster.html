(1) Please remove reference to our "The Stroller" letterbox from the <br/>
directions for our East Bay Bike Path Series II. (Providence County, <br/>
RI) The box is gone, but we don't feel too badly about it because the <br/>
directions to another box draws attention to the same delightful view.<br/>
<br/>
(2) Please make a small correction to the directions for <br/>
our "Sagamore Hill" letterbox ( Barnstable County, MA). The <br/>
directions to the box should begin "Head up the LEFTHAND trail ..." <br/>
instead of righthand.<br/>
Thanks to Mary Manatee and The Yachtsman for pointing this out. <br/>
<br/>
(3) Please remove from the list ( I can't believe you got it up there <br/>
so fast) the directions for our "Osamequin Bird Santuary" box <br/>
(Bristol County, RI). In the week or so since we placed the box <br/>
Barrington  has put up signs to say "parking by permit only". We may <br/>
replace the box sometime in the future as we are hoping this may be a <br/>
temporary situation. Thanks to Curious Crane and Latte Man for <br/>
alerting us to this development.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, <br/>
Mr. Coon  ( Although I think I'm changing my letterbox handle to Mr. <br/>
Oops) <br/>
