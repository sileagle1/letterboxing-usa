                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lone Wolf, we too were surprised to see a trail closure at Mountain <br/>
Laurel Alley, since that section of the Narragansett is part of our <br/>
Green Falls Pond letterbox. After reading the logbooks, it seems the <br/>
trail has been down for quite awhile! Anyway, we were fortunate <br/>
enough to continue on and really enjoyed the fine hike and terrific <br/>
little handcut stamps in the Alley, especially the one in the <br/>
boulders midstream.<br/>
<br/>
And, we took the opportunity to chop off that whole section of hike <br/>
from our own GFP box while adding 4 more letterboxes to the hike. <br/>

  Thanks for the directions to get me to East Haddam, but after your <br/>
busy weekend, I think I'll have to revisit one of my favorite trails. <br/>
I love the area around Green Falls Pond and with new letterboxes out <br/>
there I can't wait to hit that trail again.<br/>
  Also, I'll place your Island Sanctuary box back where it belongs <br/>
this week. My apologies to anyone who went out for it while I had it <br/>
here for repair, and to those who haven't searched for it yet, add it <br/>
to your "to do" list. The views are absolutely awesome.<br/>
Seeya on the trails,<br/>
