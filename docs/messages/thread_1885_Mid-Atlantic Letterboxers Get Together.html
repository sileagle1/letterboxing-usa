                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've started a poll to determine if there's enough interest in a Mid-Atlantic <br/>
Letterboxing get together.  Letterboxers from VA, WV, MD, DC, DE, NJ, <br/>
PA...and any others who'd be interested, please respond to the new poll <br/>
choosing a date and preference for Sat. or Sun.<br/>
<br/>
Jay C. is scoping out suitable parks in the northern VA area, hoping to find <br/>
a good spot within a reasonable driving distance for most, with picnic <br/>
facilities and lots of good spots to hide and seek boxes.    We all read <br/>
about the success of the recent CT get together, and would like to share in <br/>
the same experience.  So, please vote for a date, and let me know by post or <br/>
e-mail any additional suggestions you might want to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
