I can plant my boxes where I want (again, leave no trace), put them in whatever I want (Rubbermaid, Tupperware, soap dish, film canister, peanut butter jar) write whatever clues I want (complex or straightforward, riddles or pictures) and I can count whatever I want, however I want. I say, do it in whatever way makes YOU happy!  If you want to count your hitchhiker as a plant - do it!  If you want to make a new category - do it!  Just have fun!  I don't believe the LBNA police are going to come and fine you for a violation  ;-)MemliliP.S. Happy Mother's Day to one and all!<br/>
