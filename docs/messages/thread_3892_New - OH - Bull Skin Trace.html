Difficulty: 2 (Hiking Trails)<br/>
In Caesar's Creek State Park, OH<br/>
One box is in Clinton County and one in Warren County <br/>

<br/>
The Caesar Creek area was named for a black slave captured by the <br/>
Shawnee on a raid along the Ohio River. The Shawnee adopted Caesar <br/>
and gave him this valley as his hunting ground. Caesar lived here in <br/>
the 18th century during the time Blue Jacket was Shawnee war chief <br/>
and Caesar was said to have gone on many raids with him.<br/>
<br/>
Before that, this area was the home of the prehistoric Adena and <br/>
Hopewell Indians.  An Adena mound lies partially submerged in the <br/>
lake at the south end of the closed "Mound Road" you walk on for this <br/>
quest.  <br/>
<br/>
Later, three major historic tribes dwelled here:  the Wyandot, the <br/>
Miami and the Shawnee.  <br/>
<br/>
The famous Bull Skin Trace follows the ridge that makes up the <br/>
eastern edge of the lake along mound road.  Here, it followed what <br/>
was Mound Road until that road was closed during the building of <br/>
Caesar Creek Lake in the 1970s.  It was an Indian route, then a <br/>
pioneer route, and finally became part of the Underground Railroad <br/>
which led runaway slaves to the many Quaker homesteads in the area.  <br/>
<br/>
Drive to this place along State Route 380 south from Xenia in Greene <br/>
County.  Turn right at Center road toward the camping at Caesar's <br/>
Creek State Park.  When you arrive at the stop sign, you are crossing <br/>
old Mound Road.  Park at the small lot where Mound Road and Center <br/>
Road cross.  <br/>
<br/>
This letterboxing quest can be done on foot or with a mountain bike.  <br/>
If you walk it will take about an hour.  There are two letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
The first is a micro-box, a 35mm film container.  It contains a <br/>
letterboxing set of instructions which doubles as the log.  Also, of <br/>
course, there is a stamp in the container.  Please use a small <br/>
personal stamp for this micro-box.  Suggested maximum is one inch <br/>
diameter.  The second letterbox is a standard size plastic letterbox. <br/>
