when i drove to ** ******, i looked and i looked and i looked. I <br/>
drove day and even night looking for the location of this box. I <br/>
searched ****** ** every free minute until i gave up. I asked for <br/>
clues, and they didn't help me. I asked friends at work who knew * <br/>
******** and they didn't have a clue. A few months past and i <br/>
desided to go back to **** *****. not only did i not find the box, <br/>
but i think i lost my compass. At that point i had spent enough time <br/>
searching for this box. it was frustrating me. stupid ***** ****. i <br/>
didn't know ** ******* like i thought. <br/>
<br/>
today i asked for more help. i didn't get anymore, but someone said <br/>
something. a friend said "your not looking hard enough." i went back <br/>
to **** ***** and realized that wasn't the problem. i was looking to <br/>
hard. i should have found this box days after it was placed, but <br/>
instead, i let my fat head get in the way. <br/>
<br/>
i appreciated the help everyone gave me. i like to think of myself <br/>
as an aggressive boxer. every weekend looking for a new box or <br/>
placing a new box. in my head, i feel that i need every box in the <br/>
state of new hampshire. i want to have the most boxes planted in new <br/>
hampshire. i want to be the best. known like the "gods" of <br/>
letterboxing, wanda and pete. as some of you know, i am a great guy. <br/>
to others, i still may be remembered for my growing pains. either <br/>
way, i showed some weakness this week. all i know is, i'm glad i <br/>
found such wonderful people to associate with. i may never be like <br/>
wanda and pete, but i can try.<br/>

  Congrats on finally capturing your "White Whale". My most satisfying finds are the ones I really earned. It gives me such a sense of accomplishment. Good for you!<br/>
