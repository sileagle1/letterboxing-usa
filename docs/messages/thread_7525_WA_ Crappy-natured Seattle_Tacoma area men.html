                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sorry but I can't agree with you regarding some points here.  A <br/>
few months ago, I learned about letterboxing and was extremely <br/>
excited to start participating in the adventure.  Over the past <br/>
couple of months I have placed and located several boxes in my <br/>
area.  I received a message from Glenn (of Tacoma) the day I placed <br/>
my first letterbox (in July, I think) that included a video of their <br/>
antics at my letterbox that I placed in my hometown near the Seattle <br/>
area.  I perceived the 15 second video clip they included as <br/>
something pretty jovial and sort of a gentle 'hazing' to welcome me <br/>
into the sport of letterboxing.  I took it as a friendly gesture not <br/>
as a threat or intimidation.  The video suggested that they found <br/>
the box and simply tossed it in the general location of its actual <br/>
hiding place and left without putting it back.  This was just a <br/>
joke, upon further inspection, the letterbox was actual re-hidden <br/>
safe and sound in its intended hiding place.  I'm not sure what else <br/>
has transpired in this community regarding the various men in the <br/>
Seattle/Tacoma area.  I just want to defend Glenn in this particular <br/>
case as I never felt threatened or intimidated by his antics in this <br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a married, stay at home, homeschooling mom (in the Army <br/>
Reserves) who joined this sport to provide us with an excuse to get <br/>
out and enjoy the outdoors and to lessen the stress we feel as a <br/>
family which has two members who may, at any moment, be called upon <br/>
to defend the country (which is a perpetual VERY STRESSFUL thought <br/>
in my mind) in far off locations.  We already loved doing outdoorsy <br/>
activities and this sport seemed to add an additional intriguing <br/>
element to it and provided an opportunity for the family to get <br/>
together during an exciting activity.  It provided me with an <br/>
opportunity to get 'artistic' as it required us to create stamps and <br/>
come up with interesting ideas for creating the containers to hide <br/>
the letterbox contents in and to research the various locations in <br/>
which we could try to hide the boxes.  I also added an extra <br/>
challenge to myself, in trying to participate in the sport without <br/>
spending a tremendous fortune in the process.  This encouraged me to <br/>
scour thrift shops and dollar stores trying to procure items for the <br/>
contents of the letterboxes.  I always love a 'fiscal' challenge--<br/>
I guess that's the former professional working woman turned SAHM <br/>
trying to make ends meet on one salary transitional quality showing <br/>
through here.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have really enjoyed many aspects of letterboxing (despite <br/>
my car getting broken into and over $2,000 of contents being <br/>
stolen/damaged during a recent letterbox hunt in Tacoma).  I have <br/>
visited myriad locations that are beautiful, breathtaking, <br/>
exsquisite, challenging, daunting and historical--places that I <br/>
would never have known about prior to letterboxing--all because of <br/>
this sport.  I have seen animals and plants that I've never seen <br/>
before. I've learned how to identify various types of trees. I <br/>
climbed mountains with a baby on my back that I would have never <br/>
previously attempted by myself (with a 3 year old in tow).  I've <br/>
camped at locations around our area in pursuit of far off <br/>
letterboxes.  I've climbed over an incredible obstacle and down a 20 <br/>
foot cliff trying to locate a letterbox (with a baby on my back &amp; a <br/>
3 year old in tow--Snoq Falls--what a rush!!!).  I've met many <br/>
friendly people (virtually) through email exchanges upon finding <br/>
their/my letterboxes along the way.  All of these people I have <br/>
found to be quite interesting and friendly and people, even despite <br/>
our probable differences in many other different areas/aspects of <br/>
life, that I think I could become close friends with if we ever were <br/>
to meet in person.  All of these positive things have resulted from <br/>
our letterboxing in my area (predominantly Seattle, but I've <br/>
ventured a bit into Oregon and Northern California, as well).<br/>
<br/>
As I'm quite new to this sport, I'm not sure what events, if any, <br/>
may have transpired in this area before my learning about and recent <br/>
involvement in the sport.  I know, however, in a large community <br/>
such as this the letterboxing of North America (or is it the world <br/>
now?), that people are united by one major reason, which is they <br/>
have a passion for the hobby of letterboxing.  There may exist many <br/>
other differences among these people, but for this instant and <br/>
regarding this activity, they all seem to share a passion and an <br/>
intense feeling for letterboxing.  Can't that be enough, especially <br/>
in a world that is so threatened by outsiders whose sole mission in <br/>
life seems to be to destroy our culture in its entirety?  <br/>
Letterboxing is one more aspect where we, as a <br/>
people/nation/country/hobby group, can unite and share joy and a <br/>
common goal in the sheer act of placing and locating letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope many positive things will result from letterboxing in the <br/>
future, in my case, my life and the lives of many members of my <br/>
family and close friends, have been richly blessed by our recent <br/>
participation in letterboxing.  I hope you have been so wonderfully <br/>
and positively blessed, as well, in your pursuits of the sport.<br/>

letterboxes of those who "don't measure up".  Their posts have been <br/>
rude and down right mean.  They've even logged into the group under <br/>

Many felt that their "antics" wasn't hazing but harrasement.<br/>

Subject: What the...?<br/>
<br/>
I've been watching the posts from the sidelines for a while now and <br/>
feel compelled to chime in with my own 2 cents worth.<br/>
<br/>
I thought these boards were for Letterboxing. Benchmarks and Geo-<br/>
caching should be discussed on that website. Since many letterboxers <br/>
do NOT geo-cache, count your benchmarks at the appropriate web site.<br/>
<br/>
While I'm on the subject of counting... Who cares how many boxes <br/>
anyone has found or not? Does it really change the fun that you're <br/>
having while you're out hunting for the letterbox? The only one that <br/>
gets cheated is the one who mis-represents themselves. I couldn't <br/>
care less if someone has found 50 or 2000 boxes because it doesn't <br/>
change MY letterboxing experience.<br/>
<br/>
First finders? Bring 'em on. There's a certain pride to be had in <br/>
being the first to log into a box that no one else has found, <br/>
especially if it's a mystery box. Enjoy your find, brag about it <br/>
(not too much though) and then go about the business of letterboxing <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
A 5 yeard old child prodigy? Please.<br/>
<br/>
Again, this was just my 2 cents worth. Take it or leave it as you <br/>
please.<br/>

&gt; I'd have to agree with Monica, don't feel sorry for these folks.  I'd <br/>
&gt; like to enlighten you to the fact also that the video clip WAS NOT A <br/>
&gt; JOKE.  It is a threat along with the little message of their <br/>

&gt; Subject: What the...?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been watching the posts from the sidelines for a while now <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; feel compelled to chime in with my own 2 cents worth.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thought these boards were for Letterboxing. Benchmarks and Geo-<br/>
&gt; caching should be discussed on that website. Since many <br/>
letterboxers <br/>
&gt; do NOT geo-cache, count your benchmarks at the appropriate web <br/>
site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I'm on the subject of counting... Who cares how many boxes <br/>
&gt; anyone has found or not? Does it really change the fun that you're <br/>
&gt; having while you're out hunting for the letterbox? The only one <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; gets cheated is the one who mis-represents themselves. I couldn't <br/>
&gt; care less if someone has found 50 or 2000 boxes because it doesn't <br/>
&gt; change MY letterboxing experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First finders? Bring 'em on. There's a certain pride to be had in <br/>
&gt; being the first to log into a box that no one else has found, <br/>
&gt; especially if it's a mystery box. Enjoy your find, brag about it <br/>
&gt; (not too much though) and then go about the business of <br/>
letterboxing <br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A 5 yeard old child prodigy? Please.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, this was just my 2 cents worth. Take it or leave it as you <br/>
&gt; please.<br/>

I'm not sure what this means.  I was the original recipient of the <br/>
video clip and it was in response to my first letterbox.  I <br/>
perceived the video clip as a joke and sort of a 'jokingly' welcome <br/>
into the 'letterboxing world'.  I don't know Glenn or Bill from the <br/>
man on the moon, I just know that apparently I WAS THE ONE WHO <br/>
RECEIVED THE VIDEO and it was in reference to MY BOX.  We (my family <br/>
of several members) laughed so hard upon viewing it that we could <br/>
hardly move.  I never once felt threatened or intimidated by them <br/>
(nor did any of my family members.  In fact, the last little bit in <br/>
the text portion of the email said that they were happy to find my <br/>
boxes, they got a history lesson to boot (referencing the DuPont <br/>
letterboxes) and that it wasn't a bad attempt for a newbie <br/>
(something like 'not bad for a newbie').  I took the entire incident <br/>
as a 'positive' and friendly prank and had no idea that other folks <br/>
had received the video, too.  I hope this sheds some light on this <br/>
subject.  I'm starting to not enjoy this website anymore and may <br/>
refrain from participating in the future.  What a potentially <br/>
exciting and invigorating sport.  Too bad it has to digress to these <br/>
sorts of things on the websites every couple of months (and even <br/>
worse it was the first few months that I started participating so <br/>
that's my ENTIRE perception of this sport).  I sure hope things <br/>
improve here in the future because I have more precious and life-<br/>
threatening issues to be concerned about these days (such as <br/>
deploying to far off lands to defend this country) than to spend <br/>
much time or energy concerned about what is stated on this message <br/>
thread.  I would love to continue participating in this sport but <br/>
boy do I need a mental vacation from all of this rubbish...  My <br/>
stomach's tied up in knots over this stuff &amp; I'm a very friendly, <br/>
non-confrontational person (and a Mom to boot)!<br/>
