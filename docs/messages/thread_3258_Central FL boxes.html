                    <div class="plaintext-content">Saturday, my daughter-in-law and I finally returned to Fort DeSoto <br/>
Park and found this box.  We weren't in the right picnic area the <br/>
first time.<br/>
<br/>
We also visited Starkey Park in Pasco County and found the Christmas <br/>
box (I went before without her so we had to return).  While there, a <br/>
raccoon walked right past us - made me nervous since he didn't seem <br/>
afraid - but left us alone so no threat of rabies.<br/>
<br/>
After Fort DeSoto, we went back to Hillsborough River State Park to <br/>
find Christmas Box #2 (we already found the first box there) but <br/>
couldn't find it.  The directions are vague since they were written <br/>
after the fact, so I don't know how accurate they are.  Will email <br/>
off list to ask a few questions about the clues.  Saw a gator <br/>
floating in the river trying to stay cool.<br/>
<br/>
It was a hot, but enjoyable day.<br/>
