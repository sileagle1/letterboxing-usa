<br/>
     This new hitchhiker was a result of an email I sent to Delirium <br/>
after reading on the LBNA Talk List that she would be putting out a <br/>
new series called Kensington to be placed in Michigan. The reason <br/>
behind the series is that her husband, Ken, sings alot . . . Ken + <br/>
sings + tons = Kensington. Get it? <br/>
<br/>
     Since we live in Kensington, CT I though and emailed Delirium <br/>
such, that she might want to carve a Kensington Hitchhiker that I <br/>
could place out here in Kensington, CT. She immediately responded <br/>
that she would and thus was born the Kensington Hitchhiker. Where <br/>
else but in LettboxingLand could 2 complete strangers work together <br/>
via email to collaborate on a HH? Look for the beautifully carved <br/>
stamp with a wonderful logbook! [Yes Ken, he is a little large but <br/>
what a piece great piece of carving!!] ;)<br/>
