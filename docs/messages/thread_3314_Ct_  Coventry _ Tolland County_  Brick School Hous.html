<div>In Coventry take Rte 44 between the junction of 
Rte 31 and Mansfield Depot Look for North River Road. turn in next to a large 
blue colonial . Head up north River to the  Y bear Left on Goose lane  
to stop. Right  now and  the school house is not far ahead.

<div>This 1825  little school  was a place 
where many children of Coventry  went for school everyday. Imagine walking 
here with friends on a frosty winter morning. Boys carried in wood for the 
little stove and all huddled close for lessons in reading , writing and 
arithmatic.  It was a quick trip when you ventured out to the outhouse in 
back of the building one side for boys one for girls.  Now cared for by the 
Coventry Historical Society the  school house has days when they recreate 
the  school experience of 1825.  </div>

<div>  To find your box: remember to keep this 
activity secret. Wait for a time when others are not around.   Go to a 
place under shutters where smoke goes up. A stack made by  students will 
hide your box.   Step away to your car or the grass to stamp up. Hide 
the box again exactly as you found it.  Have Fun - Be Safe
