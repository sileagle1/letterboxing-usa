Hmmm. if I had  read the post more carefully I would know you are on <br/>
foot!  Golden Gate Bridge is across the Bay in Marin, but I think you <br/>
can take a ferry to Sausalito form Fisherman's Wharf..so it could end <br/>
up taking a long time..although Sausalito is charming, it is a little <br/>
to shishi for me...although if you could make it there the BAy ARea <br/>
Model is fascinating!  http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/bmvc/bmvcinfo.htm<br/>
(If you like that kind of stuff)<br/>
<br/>
IF you decided to do the GGP boxes you might wnat to check into bike <br/>
rentals..would definitley make things move along faster and the park <br/>
is pretty falt..although ot a pancake.  <br/>
<br/>
The Haunted Mansion series is great fun too.  <br/>
