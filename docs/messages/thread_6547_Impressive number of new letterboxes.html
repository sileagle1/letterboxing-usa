                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
I am totally impressed by the number of new letterboxes in the Mid Atlantic Region. I never thought I would see the day. So take heart all of you who are in an area all by yourself, just keep hiding those boxes and soon the rest of the world will wake up and reward your efforts. I was getting so discouraged because, for a while there were no boxes for me to find. Occasionally someone would travel to the area and find a box but didn't hide any. After many blatent hints more showed up. NOW there are lots and I have not had a chance to go look for any. The heat is just too much for me. I am looking forward to going out in the fall and finding all the new boxes and perhaps repairing a few of my scruffed-up ones. I want to especially thank Caroline K. who wrote the Post article and to the Jolly G-man who has been a steady supporter and PROMOTER of letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to apologize for all the missing and damaged boxes that have not been replaced. For so long it seemed like "Why bother". Also thanks to all of you who have reported missing boxes and who have repaired some of them for me. In the future I plan on using sturdier containers and import some of the WV rocks from my yard to secure the boxes in place. Look this fall for harder clues and more boxes in Western MD and Northern VA and western WV panhandle.<br/>
<br/>
So THANK YOU all who have joined me in the Mid Atlantic Region in this totally silly hobby and may there be lots of nuts in your lives,<br/>
Squirrel<br/>

I just wanted to let you know how much I have enjoyed the hunts for <br/>
your boxes in particular, and I'm sorry that you had been <br/>
discouraged.  I truly look forward to searching again for more of <br/>
your boxes in the fall or whenever you can get them out there.  If <br/>
there's anything I can do to help out with your MD boxes, I'd be <br/>
happy to do so...you could mail me a new stamp for Lake Frank <br/>
Turtle, for instance, and my family and I could put it out there, or <br/>
something for any of the other boxes.  We're in central Montgomery <br/>
County, so those would be no trouble.  Yours were the first boxes we <br/>
found, so we'd feel pretty special to be able to help out.  Just let <br/>
me know!  :) <br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
