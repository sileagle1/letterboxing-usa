<br/>
As one of the  contributors of the letterboxing map of the United<br/>
States, respectfully, I would like to decline your request to reprint<br/>
the map appearing on the letterboxing web site.  By granting you<br/>
permission without a lot more detail as to its intended use, I'm afraid<br/>
in all good concience the idea does not interest me.<br/>
<br/>
There is a proliferation of clip art and stock photography available,<br/>
and I believe a map of the United States would be fairly easy to come<br/>
by.  I would strongly recommend that you pursue that direction in your<br/>
search for graphics.  The map as viewed on your computer screen has a<br/>
resolution of approximately 72 dots per inch.  Standard printing methods<br/>
prefer a dot pitch of 600-900 dots per inch.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in the completion of your project.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>

Dear Mr. Cheney,<br/>

engough. Thank you very much for teaching me too.<br/>
