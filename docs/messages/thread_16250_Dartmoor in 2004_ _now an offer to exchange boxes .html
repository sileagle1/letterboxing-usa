<br/>
I have been in contact with Graham Howard aka 'The Moorland Wizard' of<br/>
the UK, on exchanging and planting letterboxes with us.  He and his<br/>
son 'Dancing Dragon' have offered to place and monitor boxes on<br/>
Dartmoor on behalf of LbNA members.  Since just Graham and his son are<br/>
involved, the number of boxes sent to him should be limited.  He has<br/>
suggested that he and his son:<br/>
<br/>
"... can do a "placement run" and produce a map and photo set for each<br/>
of the contributors and set them out on Dartmoor as a "Tribute Walk"<br/>
and create and monitor a (many?)  special US/LbNA walk (Our term for a<br/>
set of boxes usually in a circle or figure of 8 pattern in say a 5 to<br/>
8 mile walk..) ..a Dartmoor tradition...The hunters have a walk list<br/>
which can be as hard or easy as you wish...Often the stamps are<br/>
themed..eg Letterboxing terms...Local Heros...Book tiles..(?) You may<br/>
know that Agatha Christie was a Dartmoor Lady who letterboxed &amp; Sir<br/>
Arthur Conan Doyle was another author letterboxer....and so there have<br/>
been boxes of their books and characters...but the options are vast !"  <br/>
<br/>
So what do you think, is anyone interested in exchanging boxes with<br/>
Graham &amp; his son in Dartmoor?<br/>

When When When?  Oh, do I want to go with you, CSCM and Rustypuff.  I <br/>
even have the requisite Burberry Trench Coat!  Anyone want to <br/>
volunteer to take care of Pretty Kitty, Dune Dude, and Baby Bear <br/>
while I'm gone ;-)<br/>

Way cool.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Hmm. A theme.  If I could toss in an idea, the first thing that came <br/>
to mind was to do a letterbox in honor of another LbNA letterboxer.  <br/>
That way we could have double the letterboxing presence in Dartmoor.  <br/>
Just an idea.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So what do you think, is anyone interested in exchanging boxes with<br/>

<br/>
Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes.<br/>

<br/>
What about Eric The Vermont Viking and the early days of Lb here as a<br/>
theme? <br/>
<br/>
-Here are some clue possibilities of Graham's describing plants at<br/>
Dartmoor.  #4 is a little strange, it came thru funny and I had to<br/>
fiddle with it so that it can be read (if you find weird 's and<br/>
symbols just ignore them).    Cheers, catbead<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1) Hard clues such as: "Harry's Hound goes around and around" -&gt;&gt;<br/>
Graham speaking: "...That's it !!!!..in a 365 square mile park !  (Leo<br/>
and I have found it <grin>)".<br/>
<br/>
2) Easy clues that children can go on.<br/>
<br/>
3) A numbered walk between 8 &amp; 26 (alphabet), although the average is<br/>
about 12 - 20 boxes.  Some of the walks have stamping sheets that can<br/>
be detailed with a story of each stamp, and a time limit is often<br/>
imposed to make it more difficult - as well as to protect the environment.<br/>
<br/>
4) This is what he calls a "walk list" (a 'tor' is a small rocky<br/>
Volcanic "hill"):<br/>
<br/>
SEEN AROUND FEATHER TOR`<br/>
This letterbox Walk is an easy circular walk of about 2?<br/>
starting and finishing at Barn Hill car park (5310 7515). <br/>
Boxes are not necessarily sited near depicted subjects. <br/>
Any problems please contact The Moorland Wizard on 01 707 873 069<br/>
