 &gt; ...) but we can't seem to figure out the best strategy to keep the stamps<br/>
and our journals dry. does anyone else out there box in the rain too?<br/>
 &gt; If so are there certain things that work really well for anyone to keep<br/>
journals/stamps etc dry?<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; thanks<br/>

Yep, we box in the rain too.  Not our favorite option, but if we've traveled<br/>
somewhere to do some boxing, and it isn't TOO fierce, we still go out &amp;<br/>
about.  One benefit is that there are virtually no other people out on the<br/>
trails then!<br/>
<br/>
What we've found works best for us is carrying large golf umbrellas and<br/>
using backpack/stool combo packs.  That way we have somewhere dry to sit and<br/>
enough coverage to keep ourselves, box and logbooks all dry.  One of us<br/>
holds both umbrellas while one stamps in, then we trade tasks so the other<br/>
can stamp in.  Here's a link for one site that sells backpack/stools:<br/>
http://www.fatiguesarmynavy.com/store/item/FA2805<br/>
Golf umbrellas are usually readily available at stores such as K-Mart,<br/>
Wal-Mart, etc.  Here's a link:<br/>

<br/>
I think the idea of using clear plastic ponchos is also good.<br/>

I haven't gone out boxing in pouring-down rain, but I have started out on drizzly days that got drippier as things went along.  So far, I've been lucky and had less-rainy spells or temporary shelter (dense foilage) that I could use to  make a tiny dry spot.<br/>

I think that a clear garbage bag might do the trick in real rain -- a big one of course. I would get my box of stamp-in stuff and paper, the letterbox, and put myself and the boxes all under bag.  Don't suffocate though!! :)<br/>
