<br/>
Absolutely!! I agree with you 100%. I'm finding more and more around here<br/>
(Central MA) that this is how series are being done--just one logbook in the<br/>
last box. There are lots of them around here. The first series we planted<br/>
had 4 boxes, with logbooks in all 4 boxes. After finding a few series that<br/>
had logbooks in each box I realized that it was actually kinda annoying, so<br/>
I pulled the middle two logbooks out of the boxes. We now have one logbook<br/>
in the first and last box. That's kinda nice if the finder can't locate the<br/>
final box. That happened to me once...with a Merry Pranksters box...but they<br/>
were kind enough to give me enough of a hint that I found it the next time<br/>
out. I was SO BUMMED not to find the last box that first time, b/c I had<br/>
lots of comments I wanted to make (it is a cool series; Jigsaw Puzzle).<br/>
However, despite my frustration that day, I still believe strongly that<br/>
logbooks don't need to be in every box. Even as a planter, when I went back<br/>
to that series I found that I had four logbooks with all the same stamps in<br/>
them...in the same order. I really only need one.<br/>
<br/>
So...I say GO FOR IT!!<br/>

I have a series of 14 boxes with a logbook in just the last box, if you <br/>
ever get that far ;-)<br/>
<br/>
it makes things much easier for the folks finding them, and I really see <br/>
no point in having a logbook in each box, just a waste of time and energy.<br/>

I love the idea. Stamping into every box in a series<br/>
is tedious and time consuming. I prefer to have 2<br/>
logbooks in a series, one in the first and one in the<br/>
last ( and maybe one in the middle depending on how<br/>
many boxes are in the series ). I have a series of 9<br/>
that is in the final stages of preparation and I wll<br/>
be doing 3 logbooks. As far as comments go it gets<br/>
redundant writing meaningless blabber just to write<br/>
something. I'd rather write a nice paragraph in the<br/>
final logbook about everything I saw and went through<br/>
to get there. It also is nicer for the placer when<br/>
it's time to read what others have said about your<br/>
series. <br/>

I've encountered this a couple times already -- as long as I know this is how it is, it's fine with me!  It does give one motivation to finish the series.  Recently I did "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish," and I probably would have gone home after the 3rd box, except that I wanted to stamp the logbook!!<br/>
<br/>
The only drawback is that it means as the placer, you'll only have a record of people who were able to do the whole series/find the last box.  There is a series of 10 quilt squares nearby, and I went boxing with my mom -- we had to quit after 5, because her knees are bad.  I will go back soon though!<br/>

We did a series of 10 and couldn't find the last box which was the only one that had a log in it...It took us a year to get back and finally find it and stamp in(we had to take the trip again)...that's sad for us and the placer.<br/>

<br/>
I have been finding some interesting letterbox series plants, where the letterboxes lead you down a path and are planted at stratigic locactions. It is a nice way to make a long hike more interesting and fun for the boxer. One thing though that I find gets old is signing the logbook at each box. Geocachers use muti caches in the same way, but put the log book at the final cache. I have been thinking about taking two boxes, adding two more and make a nice series out of them that would take a longer hike and make it a little more fun, especally those who have childern. However, I was thinking of planting smaller boxes, with clues and a stamp, but no logbook, saving the logbook for the last box. For some reason that makes more sense to me. I remember finding a series that have 13 beatiful stamps, but they were spaced about 400 feet aprat (or less) and by the time I hit the last box I just stamped it, no comment.How do you guys feel about leaving the logbook for the last in a sseries as long as a stamp was included with each clue box.I am cuious about this and if you have run into something like that.

So would it be acceptable also then if the planter only put a stamp in<br/>
the final box?  I'm sure carving all those stamps is tedious to some<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
While I know that the practice of putting the logbook only in the last<br/>
box is becoming more common to "save time" and make it "less<br/>
bothersome" for the finder to have to stamp into each box along the<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think that it is up to you, me personally I like carving stamps and <br/>
making then part of the box. I find that I enjoy the challenge of <br/>
making the stamp fit the locaction. I want the finders to be able to <br/>
collect a stamp image after each find. <br/>
<br/>
I find that by the end of a long series that I am just stamping the <br/>
logbook (if there are logbook in each that is), and I have run out of <br/>
things to say. I would much rather, as some others have posted above, <br/>
find a bunch of boxes and then stamp in the logbook at the final, <br/>
where I can leave a nice meaningful comment on the series. <br/>
<br/>
I also think too that it depends on the series. I have found a few <br/>
series that really could be separate letterboxes that are loosely <br/>
tied together. These I could see having a logbook in each. But I have <br/>
found others that are interdependant of each other and close together <br/>
where signing each book gets to be a bother. <br/>
<br/>
The one that I a building is both educactional and interdependant of <br/>
one and other, where the boxes will have the clues to the next box. I <br/>
just want to make sure that not only are the finders locating their <br/>
next clue to the final, but that there is a rewarded for finding that <br/>
box with a stamp. Especailly for our younger boxers.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I again, personally don't have a problem finding clue boxes <br/>
without a stamp and logbook, but I will hike 10 miles round trip for <br/>
a single box.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thughts, thank you for yours.<br/>

I was just sitting down to reply and you probably said it in 1/10th the<br/>
number of words that I would have used anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Ditto from me.  This isn't geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
I will add that, even tho there might be a logbook in each box, that doesn't<br/>
mean I necessarily write out a long extended comment in each box.  Unless<br/>
there's a reason to for a specific box.  But if I want to comment about the<br/>
series, I put the comment in the last box.  In my neck of the woods, few<br/>
boxers write comments in the first place, so they can't exactly complain<br/>
about having to write comments for a series of boxes when they don't write<br/>
comments for even one box.<br/>
<br/>
But stamps?  Logbooks?  That's what letterboxing is.  A box has a stamp.  A<br/>
box has a logbook.  A placer creates both, a finder uses both.  To me, those<br/>
two things are the minimum requirements.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I take a non-letterboxer on most hunts.  I like stamping into each<br/>
letterbox.  What we are starting to find is too many boxes in a series,<br/>
some with logbooks, some without.  From a non-letterboxer's perspective,<br/>
it was stated "this hike really didn't need this many boxes."  So I guess<br/>
I have to ask myself, "if each box in a series does not warrant a logbook,<br/>
is it necessary to plant each one?"<br/>
<br/>
I have a series of 4 and each letterbox has its one logbook.  Quite often<br/>
letterboxers will find 1, 2 or 3 of the four, and they aren't always the<br/>
same 1, 2 or 3.  I get many comments that this series is the first<br/>
letterboxing experience they've had.  I wouldn't dream of changing the way<br/>
I create them.<br/>
<br/>
Next week marks 3 Years for this series in the wild!  I have the original<br/>
logbooks, and it's time to check on Book 2 for each of them.  I hope they<br/>
haven't been muggled.<br/>

The only problem I have with it is that my husband isn't into letterboxing and loves to hike.  If there is a logbook in every box, it gets very boring for him so I hurry through the process so we can get moving.  It goes much smoother if there is 1 logbook at the end.  All my series have 1 book - however - my bonuses have a separate logbook so I can see who was paying attention.    <br/>

I agree with SpringChick &amp; Mosey that there should be a book in each <br/>
box.  If you only have one book and that box goes missing or the <br/>
finder can't find it, you don't have their stamp.  As a finder, if <br/>
logging into each book is a PITA for you, no one says you HAVE to log <br/>
into every box.  You could always wait until the last box and stamp <br/>
in there only, and/or make your comments there only.  Of course, if <br/>
you don't find the last box, you have to back track to another box to <br/>
leave your stamp/comments.<br/>

&gt; How do you guys feel about leaving the logbook for the last in a<br/>

<br/>
My own personal feeling:  If the clues for each box are separate so <br/>
that you could conceivably DNF on some of them but find the others <br/>
OK, then there should be a log book in each box.  However, if each <br/>
box contains the clues to find the NEXT box, so if you DNF on one <br/>
then you can't find any more, then a log book in the last box only <br/>
makes sense.  Your stamp in the one log book indicates you <br/>
successfully found ALL of the boxes.<br/>

If your husband is in a hurry to get back to the hike, and you're taking the<br/>
time to write in the logbook as a thank you to the placer, consider skipping<br/>
the writing-a-note-in-the-logbook part of it and, once you get home, sit<br/>

way, <br/>
&gt; but put the log book at the final cache. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been thinking about taking two boxes, adding two more and <br/>
make <br/>
&gt; a nice series out of them that would take a longer hike and make it <br/>
a <br/>

&gt; thinking of planting smaller boxes, with clues and a stamp, but no <br/>
&gt; logbook, saving the logbook for the last box. For some reason that <br/>
&gt; makes more sense to me. I remember finding a series that have 13 <br/>

less) <br/>

I'm glad Mosey made this suggestion; it's a good one. Another reason <br/>
to do this is if you have a comment for the placer that really should <br/>
be between the two of you, and not for the boxing public to read in <br/>
the log.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend I found five boxes just set out by a new placer. Of the <br/>
five, one of them was in a cool whip tub with an ill-fitting lid <br/>
(just wouldn't snap shut). Another was in a thin container placed <br/>
under large and heavy objects, and would soon crack under their <br/>
weight. A third was located by the side of an elementary school.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously this new person just didn't know about water damage, broken <br/>
containers and how school officials would most likely react to <br/>
strangers poking around the property when school's in session. I felt <br/>
it was more polite and discreet to mention these kinds of things not <br/>
in the logbook but in an email to the placer, and to offer my <br/>
assistance should they need it.<br/>

I'm sorry, but I guess I don't see your 8 steps as taking all that much<br/>

Time yourself sometime.  Without writing comments, those 8 steps just don't<br/>

I have a series planned for a local park that is exactly what you have outlined; a series of mini/micro boxes containing only stamps with the logbook in the very last one.? <br/>

&gt; &gt; I have been finding some interesting letterbox series plants, <br/>
where <br/>
&gt; &gt; the letterboxes lead you down a path and are planted at stratigic <br/>
&gt; &gt; locactions. It is a nice way to make a long hike more interesting <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; fun for the boxer. One thing though that I find gets old is <br/>
signing <br/>
&gt; &gt; the logbook at each box. Geocachers use muti caches in the same <br/>
way, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but put the log book at the final cache.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So would it be acceptable also then if the planter only put a stamp <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; the final box?  I'm sure carving all those stamps is tedious to some<br/>
&gt; people.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I know that the practice of putting the logbook only in the <br/>
last<br/>
&gt; box is becoming more common to "save time" and make it "less<br/>
&gt; bothersome" for the finder to have to stamp into each box along the<br/>
&gt; way, I can't help thinking that this is simply another effort to<br/>
&gt; short-shift the letterboxing experience.  After all, finding a<br/>
&gt; letterbox, even if it is just one in a series, involves the stamping<br/>
&gt; process -- and it is a two-way process which includes stamping the <br/>
box<br/>
&gt; stamp into your log and stamping your stamp into the box log.  This <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; a fundamental part of letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are only interested in finding boxes out in the woods without<br/>
&gt; the stamping process, perhaps the geocaching philosophy better fits<br/>
&gt; your goals?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my old-school perspective, which seems to be in the minority<br/>

&gt; So I guess I have to ask myself, "if each box in a series<br/>
&gt; does not warrant a logbook, is it necessary to plant each one?"<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm.  I haven't planted a series; now that I think about it, this is <br/>
probably a large reason why.  I have been thinking about a series or <br/>
two, usually because there are two or more points of interest within <br/>
the same park or the like, but even in those cases I'm more likely to <br/>
create two separate letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
It's not the length of the hike.  I've got a couple out there that <br/>
involve a hike of a couple of miles or more.  I don't feel the need <br/>
to plant intermediate boxes just to keep the interest up or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons I'd been thinking of planting a series is because <br/>
I really want to bring people to a very particular spot, but there's <br/>
nowhere there to plant a container large enough for a stamp and log <br/>
book.  So my plan was to plant just a stamp with some instructions <br/>
for finding a second box, somewhere nearby where a larger container <br/>
can be hidden.  I had that one pretty well worked out when I came up <br/>
with a way to hide a log book at the first site, so the series idea <br/>
went away.<br/>

Well, that makes me feel a bit better.  I rarely write anything in <br/>
the log book; I usually just stamp, and my sig stamp includes my <br/>
trailname.  The only thing I write is the date.<br/>
<br/>
If I have something to say to the planter, I say it in an e-mail to <br/>
the planter when I log the find.  To my mind, writing in the log book <br/>
at the letterbox is not writing to the planter but rather to other <br/>
finders.  Presumably other finders have just experienced the same <br/>
hunt that I have, so telling them how lovely it is is a waste of <br/>
time.  What I usually write about is things that are interesting <br/>
about my particular experience that day, such as seeing some wildlife <br/>
or making some dumb mistake trying to find the box.<br/>

&gt;   I know it doesn't seem like much, but consider that the person <br/>
has a 5 box series (or more) - these steps will be done an additional <br/>
4 times and my husband, is standing there waiting.  And as someone <br/>
else mentioned, if the boxes are very close together, it doesn't make <br/>
for a pleasant experience for a non boxer especially. <br/>

&gt; If your husband is in a hurry to get back to the hike, and you're <br/>
taking the<br/>
&gt; time to write in the logbook as a thank you to the placer, consider <br/>
skipping<br/>
&gt; the writing-a-note-in-the-logbook part of it and, once you get <br/>
home, sit<br/>
&gt; down at the computer and hit the contact-the-placer button. That <br/>
way the<br/>
&gt; time you spend stamping into all those logbooks will be offset by <br/>
the time<br/>
&gt; you WON'T be spending writing out the thank yous in the field.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That way it also alerts the placer, without them needing to check <br/>
on the<br/>
&gt; box, that the box was either safe and sound or perhaps not safe and <br/>
not<br/>
&gt; sound and needs attention.<br/>

&gt; As someone had suggested earlier, you can always just disregard the <br/>
&gt; logbook in the box if it is too botherstome for you to stamp the <br/>
&gt; placer's logbook in exchange for stamping their stamp into your <br/>

Is it?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, as far as I am concerned, there are no rules.  It maybe how it <br/>
is done for you, but it is not how it is done for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, having placed series, I find it bothersome and costly to <br/>
have a logbook in each box.  I see no point in it if you are going to <br/>
get the same stamps in each one.  Why would I want 14 logbooks that are <br/>
all the same when one will do?  Further, not having a logbook allows for <br/>
a smaller box and if the box gets wet it will not matter.  While I make <br/>
the boxes as watertight as possible, stuff happens that is simply beyond <br/>
my control.  Why make more work for myself?<br/>
<br/>
As a finder, I do find it tedious to stamp in every box in a series.  <br/>
The self satisfaction of knowing I was there is the only gratification I <br/>
really need.<br/>
<br/>
Point is, letterboxing is supposed to be fun.  When it gets to the point <br/>
that something is tedious or bothersome, it is no longer fun.  The way I <br/>
look at it, if is something that has become an exercise and I can remove <br/>
that something, I do.  I want people to enjoy finding the boxes.  Clues <br/>
can be frustrating, a hike can be frustrating, but the process should <br/>
not be frustrating.<br/>

sport of letterboxing while we're at it.  All over, I see time wasting<br/>
practices that we could work on:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Baseball.  A batter only gets 3 strikes, why should a pitcher get 4<br/>
balls for a walk?  Lose that fourth ball and save time!  Batter is out after<br/>
3 strikes, batter walks after 3 balls.  And speaking of pitching, while<br/>
we're at it............why in tarnation do we need a pitcher and allll that<br/>
time they take on that silly mound?  Haven't these guys ever heard of<br/>
T-Ball???  And while we're at it...........do we really have to take the<br/>
time to sing the National Anthem before every.  single.  game.  ???<br/>
<br/>
2.  Football.  Get rid of that stupid time wasting practice of trying to<br/>
kick that pig thru those two big posts.  After all, the team gets all those<br/>
points for the touchdown anyway.  Get rid of that point after and get on<br/>
with the game!<br/>
<br/>
3.  Horse racing.  Allll those minutes wasted getting those big fat butts<br/>
into those skinny narrow shoots?  And if a horse accidentally breaks, people<br/>
get to wait all over again?? Get rid of the gate.  When they hit the track,<br/>
blow a whistle, and let 'em take off!  And that crazy trumpet playing before<br/>
the race.  Waste of time!<br/>
<br/>
And writing --  why do authors spend so much time writing and readers spend<br/>
so much time reading??<br/>
<br/>
Moby Dick:  "Once upon a time there was a whale.  It was a white whale.<br/>
Captain Ahab was an unhappy man.  Captain Ahab was obsessed with killing the<br/>
white whale.  The end."  Really now, doesn't that say it all?<br/>
<br/>
Ah oooooooooh, the way Shakespeare could be condensed.  Look at the kudos<br/>
we'd get from high school English students around the country.  Hamlet has<br/>
29,551 words!  I'll bet we could knock that down to 10,000 or so and<br/>
everybody would still get the idea just fine.<br/>
<br/>
I just told the dawgz that we're going to save time and they're going from 2<br/>
meals a day to 1 meal a day.  Making 2 meals a day for them wastes time.<br/>
They just told me that's OK, that I'll be their second meal.<br/>

Baseball and football are not letterboxing.  Letterboxing is constantly <br/>
evolving, constantly changing.  It is one of the reasons I enjoy it so. <br/>
<br/>
Were we to do letterboxing as it had always been done, we would still be <br/>
leaving calling cards in jars in the middle of some marsh somewhere.  We <br/>
would not be communicating clues across the internet, and in fact, many <br/>
here would not even be able to get clues, as they had not tripped over <br/>
enough boxes yet to be qualified for them.<br/>
<br/>
And the thing is, if you want to do it as it had been done, they you <br/>
can.  Or you can go along with the changes.  The choice is yours.<br/>

think it is safe to say, yes this is how it is done.<br/>

The fact that people have come along since then and feel it is <br/>
necessary and acceptable to change the game to suit their own ideals <br/>
and preferences does not change the fact that there is a defined way <br/>
it is done.<br/>
<br/>
Personally if I found a letterbox that was intentionally planted <br/>
without a logbook, I would think the planter was lazy or just didn't <br/>
care about their creation enough to provide a complete package.  I <br/>
certainly would not feel that they had done me a favor.  If I didn't <br/>
want to stamp into a logbook at a letterbox, I would look for <br/>
geocaches. <br/>
<br/>
When it gets to the point where letterboxing becomes bothersome or <br/>
tedious, then maybe it is time to ask yourself if perhaps you are <br/>
participating in the wrong hobby, not change the way the game is <br/>
played to make it more suitable for you.<br/>

<br/>
It is really only the past couple of years that I have seen this trend <br/>
toward tailoring the game to suit individual needs and disregard for <br/>
the way the game was originally established in the U.S.<br/>
<br/>
This is the same span of time when so many of those who pioneered the <br/>
game here in the U.S. have quietly walked away, because the game they <br/>
so loved was no longer what they had envisioned, rather had turned into <br/>
some dumbed-down version that had lost much of the original spirit and <br/>
challenge.<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say that there is anything wrong with planting <br/>

you change the game and still call it letterboxing?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh............I think if you went back to the beginning of baseball, the<br/>
same as you mention going back to the very beginning of<br/>
letterboxing..........you'll find that baseball has evolved just a little.<br/>
Many baseball rule changes are still fought over and argued about.<br/>
<br/>
But there's a biiiiiiiiig difference when it comes to *why* the rules are<br/>
changed.  Letterboxing seems to be changing to get away from the aspect of<br/>
it being an art (because, after all, art is work), it seems to be changing<br/>
to make it as simple and stupid as possible, it seems to be changing to make<br/>
it as "convenient" as possible.  Heaven forbid we ask hubby to stop long<br/>
enough to stamp in a logbook.  Heaven forbid we make a hike longer than<br/>
someone's 6 year old wants to walk.  Heaven forbid someone has to put more<br/>
work into a stamp than stopping at Hobby Lobby when they have a<br/>
50%-off-all-stamps sale.  Heaven forbid we try to make a logbook a little<br/>
nicer than the small lined notebooks available on sale for 69 cents at the<br/>
Dollar Store.<br/>
<br/>
I think another thing that needs to be taken into consideration are that the<br/>
beginnings of letterboxing in the U.K. and the beginnings of letterboxing in<br/>
the U.S. are two different things.  Here in the U.S., when it began, it<br/>
didn't begin with cards, jars, and marshes.  Or should we play be playing<br/>
baseball by cricket rules and football by rugby rules?  Nothing is truly<br/>
original.  Any sport ya look at, there's a predecessor someplace even if<br/>
only in the sense of the idea of the whole thing.  So letterboxing --<br/>
letterboxing in the U.S. -- hasn't really "evolved" all that much until the<br/>
past couple of years.  It's only evolved dramatically over a length of time<br/>
if one goes back to the very beginning "idea" of it in the U.K.  Boxing in<br/>
the U.S. never *has* been like boxing in the U.K. in a large number of ways.<br/>
<br/>
I think letterboxing may eventually end up on a slide to being two different<br/>
games.  A traditional version and a dumbed down version.  And the dumbing<br/>
down slide might eventually get things so dumbed down that some of the older<br/>
traditions might begin to look good again.  The pendulum might begin to<br/>
swing back.  The same way not all that many adults really want to play<br/>
T-Ball.  Heck, probably not too many parents, aunts, or uncles even want to<br/>
*watch* T-Ball.  The same way there's great literature for adults and then<br/>
there's Reader's Digest Condensed Books.<br/>

Baseball and football are not letterboxing.  Letterboxing is constantly<br/>
evolving, constantly changing.  It is one of the reasons I enjoy it so.<br/>
<br/>
Were we to do letterboxing as it had always been done, we would still be<br/>
leaving calling cards in jars in the middle of some marsh somewhere.  We<br/>
would not be communicating clues across the internet, and in fact, many<br/>
here would not even be able to get clues, as they had not tripped over<br/>
enough boxes yet to be qualified for them.<br/>
<br/>
And the thing is, if you want to do it as it had been done, they you<br/>
can.  Or you can go along with the changes.  The choice is yours.<br/>

Words by : Adam McNaughton<br/>
Tune of : The Mason's Apron <br/>
<br/>
There was a king nodding in his garden all alone, <br/>
When his brother in his ear poured a little bit of henbane, <br/>
Stole his brother's crown and his money and his widow, <br/>
But the dead king walked and got his son and said, "Now listen kiddo, <br/>
I've been killed and it's your duty to take revenge on Claudius, <br/>
Kill him quick and clean and tell the nation what a fraud he is." <br/>
The kid says, "Right I'll do it, but I'll have to play it crafty, <br/>
So that no will suspect me I'll kid on that I'm a dafty." <br/>
<br/>
So for all except Horatio, and he counts him as a friend, <br/>
Hamlet, that's the kid, he kids on he's 'round the bend, <br/>
And because he's not yet willing for obligatory killing, <br/>
He tries to make his uncle think he's tuppence off a shilling. <br/>
Takes a rise out of Polonius, treats poor Ophelia vile, <br/>
Tells Rosencrantz and Guildenstern that Denmark's blooded bile, <br/>
Then a troupe of traveling actors local seven eighty four, <br/>
Arrive to do a special one-night gig in Elsinore. <br/>
<br/>
                Hamlet, Hamlet, acting balmy, <br/>
                Hamlet, Hamlet, loves his mommy, <br/>
                Hamlet, Hamlet, hesitating, <br/>
                He wonders if the ghost's a fake, <br/>
                And that is why he's waiting. <br/>
<br/>
So Hamlet wrote a scene for the players to enact, <br/>
So Horatio and he could see if Claudius cracked, <br/>
The play was called "The Mousetrap" (not the one that's running now), <br/>
And sure enough the king walked out before the final bow. <br/>
So Hamlet's got the proof his uncle gave his dad the dose, <br/>
The only problem being now that Claudius knows he knows, <br/>
So while Hamlet tells his mother her new husband's not a fit man, <br/>
Uncle Claude takes out a contract with the English king as hit man. <br/>
<br/>
Then when Hamlet killed Polonius, and the corpus was delecti, <br/>
Was the king's excuse to send him for an English hempen necktie, <br/>
With Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to make quite sure he got there, <br/>
But Hamlet jumped the boat and put the finger straight on that pair. <br/>
When Laertes heard his dad's killed in the bedroom in the arras, <br/>
He came running back to Elsinore tout-suite hot-foot from Paris. <br/>
When Ophelia heard her dad's killed by the man she was to marry, <br/>
After saying it with flowers, she committed hari-kari. <br/>
<br/>
                Hamlet, Hamlet, no messin' <br/>

                Convinced him all men good or bad, <br/>
                At last must come to dust. <br/>
<br/>
Then Laertes lost his cool and was demanding retribution, <br/>
The king said keep your head and I'll supply you a solution. <br/>
So the king arranged a swordfight for the interested parties, <br/>
With a blunted sword for Hamlet and a sharp sword for Laertes. <br/>
And to make double sure (the old belt-and-braces line), <br/>
He fixed up a poisoned sword-tip and a poisoned cup of wine. <br/>
The poisoned sword got Hamlet, but Laertes went and fluffed it, <br/>
Because he stabbed himself and he confessed before he snuffed it. <br/>
<br/>
Then Hamlet's mommy drank the wine and as her face turned blue, <br/>
Hamlet said, "I think this king's a baddie through and through." <br/>
"Incestuous, murderous, damned Dane," he said, to be precise, <br/>
Then made up for hesitating once, by killing Claudius twice. <br/>
He stabbed him with his knife and forced the wine between his lips <br/>
He said, "The rest is silence," and he cashed in all his chips. <br/>
They fired a volley over him that shook the topmost rafter, <br/>
And Fortinbras, knee deep in Danes, lived happily ever after. <br/>

&gt; This is the same span of time when so many of those who pioneered the <br/>
&gt; game here in the U.S. have quietly walked away, because the game they <br/>
&gt; so loved was no longer what they had envisioned,<br/>
<br/>
Oh, were still here, hiding in our out of the way holes enjoying what<br/>
we enjoy doing, and watching some of the goings on with amusement ...<br/>
the less bothered we are, the better.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This is not to say that there is anything wrong with planting <br/>
&gt; rubbermaid boxes in parking lots or sending them through the mail or <br/>
&gt; eliminating logbooks or even stamps from your boxes,<br/>
<br/>
What seems even more surprising, at least to a simple-minded bumpkin<br/>
like myself, is how some people seem to get so up in arms about<br/>
these sorts of activities.<br/>
<br/>
When you think about it, if you write some text and place it on a web<br/>
site, or put some tupperware container on some public land, that is,<br/>
land shared by others on a putatively equal basis, it would seem you<br/>
have very little in the way of rights to expectations as to how those<br/>
artefacts are interacted with those who encounter them.  Moreover,<br/>
if one encounters such artefacts, one again has little in the rights<br/>
of expectations as to their quality or fitness for their personal<br/>
enjoyment, having presumably no warranty with their creator.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, as a  player in such a community, one would think it is only<br/>
logical that treating these artefacts, creating these artefacts, etc.,<br/>
within the norms of social convention of the community one plays in,<br/>
will, in the long run, have benefits to oneself.  At the very least,<br/>
it seems polite to disclose when one will be deviating from the norms<br/>
of social convention long before someone else has invested a ton of<br/>
recourses based on false assumptions, until at least, these deviations<br/>
become accepted parts of the social canon, or are lost to the dustbin<br/>
of obscurity or cultism.<br/>
<br/>
JMHO -- its my attitude anyway, and my guess is that taking something<br/>
similar to this would mitigate 99% of flames, judgementalisms, and<br/>
all that noise that has driven so many underground (and to their<br/>
chagrin is still present when they surface periodically).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; When Jeremy Irish decided to use a GPS to mark box locations instead of <br/>
&gt; using clues, he didn't just say he was going to make changes to the way <br/>
&gt; letterboxing was done, rather he called it geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of historical record, Jeremy Irish neither invented<br/>
geocaching, nor coined the term.  Dave Ulmer and Matt Strom [sp?]<br/>
deserve those credits.  It is also a matter of historical record that<br/>
geocaching was invented independent of letterboxing; in fact, I'm<br/>
not convinced its creator was aware of the hobby. (geocaching was<br/>
invented within days, and in direct response to, President Clinton's<br/>
executive order to disable selective availability).<br/>

awhile. Anyway SP,point taken but, there's always a but. I think it depends on the series. <br/>
For example I've had a series on a local trail with 13 boxes in a mile stretch, it was a X-<br/>
mas series meant to be temporary, I only put a log in the last one. I have other series with <br/>
longer hikes in between and have logs in each of these. <br/>
I also think this is a caution against speed boxing, too many boxes in a day can get <br/>
wearing. Also too many boxes too close together. There are alot of miles of trails out there <br/>
that need boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are only interested in finding boxes out in the woods without<br/>
&gt; the stamping process, perhaps the geocaching philosophy better fits<br/>
&gt; your goals?<br/>

I have been considering building a container for my sig stamp and ink <br/>
pad so you just set it down on the ground and flip it open and both <br/>
are there ready for use -- perhaps complete with a flat spot on the <br/>
lid for stamping.  As it is, my ink pad is in one baggie, my stamp is <br/>
in another container, and both have to be dug out of my shoulder bag <br/>
each time.<br/>

&gt; Are you expecting that each box in the series would have a stamp from<br/>
&gt; the placer that you can stamp into your book?  If no, what is the<br/>
&gt; purpose of the box?<br/>
<br/>
Well, it *could* be a way of keeping the finder on the right track.  <br/>
You're right, though, if it doesn't have either a stamp or a log <br/>
book, it's rare that it would need to exist at all.<br/>
<br/>
One example I could think of:  You want to bring the finder to a <br/>
particular spot (a great view or some such) but there's no place to <br/>
hide anything big enough for either a log book or a stamp.  So you <br/>
hide a bison tube with a tiny set of instructions inside directing <br/>
people to the next box.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  If yes, you do not feel an acknowledgement of<br/>
&gt; their effort would be appreciated?<br/>
<br/>
OK, I guess I'm not clear on that.  Is the finder supposed to be <br/>
acknowledging the effort of the placer?  Because if so, that can be <br/>
done at the final box.  If the placer is supposed to be acknowledging <br/>
the effort of the finder, well, a stamp in each box should do that.<br/>
<br/>
One nice idea for a series is a collection of stamps that work <br/>
together to form one image.  Having only one log book at the end <br/>
works just fine here, although in some cases it'd be good to have <br/>
something in the *first* box to show what the completed image should <br/>
look like so finders know how to apply each piece.<br/>
<br/>
There is one series I'm aware of that the three stamps form one big <br/>
alligator, all the way across the page.  The three boxes are nowhere <br/>
near each other, many miles apart in different parks; one of them is <br/>
even in another county.  The problem there is that you don't want to <br/>
find the middle part of that alligator last; you can find it first or <br/>
second, but not last.  But the placer doesn't indicate which box <br/>
contains the middle part, and because the boxes are so spread out and <br/>
complete clues are provided for each, you might find them in any <br/>
order depending on which direction you're driving through.<br/>

Yep, the way I plant my boxes is the way that is<br/>
suitable to me.  No one is obligated to find them at<br/>
all.  I would like to think they offer an enjoyable<br/>
experience, but they will certainly not please<br/>
everyone equally.  And they certainly might not be<br/>
like boxes of yesteryear, which I have seen precious<br/>
few of, not living in Connecticut.  Most everything<br/>
within reasonable driving distance is by fairly new<br/>
planters.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"a letterbox contains both a stamp and a logbook"<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so the ones I put only stamps in, because I<br/>
consider them more as clues to a puzzle, you don't<br/>
have to think of as "letterboxes"....maybe CLUEboxes<br/>
or whatever.  And the next time I plant such a series,<br/>
I can just log it in as one box; that makes sense,<br/>
actually.  But I still think it makes for a fun<br/>
experience to find them, and then TADA, you find the<br/>
one special logbook for the "series."  <br/>

In geocaching, a 35mm film canister is a "micro".  A bison tube is <br/>
unofficially known as a "nano".<br/>
<br/>
A bison tube is one of those containers with a screw top that you put <br/>
on your key chain and use to hold one or two pills.  I mean to tell <br/>
ya, they are tiny!  You generally take a slip of paper about 1/2" <br/>
wide and three inches long, roll it up reeeeal tight, and jam it into <br/>
the cap and then screw the container onto it.<br/>
<br/>
In general, I suspect a bison tube is useless in letterboxing; it'd <br/>
be kinda difficult to carve a stamp to fit into one.  There are store-<br/>
bought stamps about the right size, though; in fact, I've planted <br/>
four of them -- but not in bison tubes but rather a rather larger <br/>
container like an Altoids tin.<br/>

&gt;&gt; As someone had suggested earlier, you can always just disregard the<br/>

I am in complete agreement with this. There are boxes for everyone! I some<br/>
single boxes, some drive bys, some series of 4, wiht 4 logs, a series of 4<br/>
with one log, A single box with a long hike, a new larger series with 2<br/>
logs, fairly close together placements. Someone can find something they<br/>
like and dislike within my whole P count.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I mean, as far as I am concerned, there are no rules.  It maybe how it<br/>

&gt; Personally, having placed series, I find it bothersome and costly to<br/>
&gt; have a logbook in each box.  I see no point in it if you are going to<br/>
&gt; get the same stamps in each one.  Why would I want 14 logbooks that are<br/>

&gt; What seems even more surprising, at least to a simple-minded bumpkin<br/>
&gt; like myself, is how some people seem to get so up in arms about<br/>
&gt; these sorts of activities.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When you think about it, if you write some text and place it on a <br/>
web<br/>
&gt; site, or put some tupperware container on some public land, that is,<br/>
&gt; land shared by others on a putatively equal basis, it would seem you<br/>
&gt; have very little in the way of rights to expectations as to how <br/>
those<br/>
&gt; artefacts are interacted with those who encounter them.  Moreover,<br/>
&gt; if one encounters such artefacts, one again has little in the rights<br/>
&gt; of expectations as to their quality or fitness for their personal<br/>
&gt; enjoyment, having presumably no warranty with their creator.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, as a  player in such a community, one would think it is only<br/>
&gt; logical that treating these artefacts, creating these artefacts, <br/>
etc.,<br/>
&gt; within the norms of social convention of the community one plays in,<br/>
&gt; will, in the long run, have benefits to oneself.  At the very least,<br/>
&gt; it seems polite to disclose when one will be deviating from the <br/>
norms<br/>
&gt; of social convention long before someone else has invested a ton of<br/>
&gt; recourses based on false assumptions, until at least, these <br/>
deviations<br/>
&gt; become accepted parts of the social canon, or are lost to the <br/>
dustbin<br/>
&gt; of obscurity or cultism.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; JMHO -- its my attitude anyway, and my guess is that taking <br/>
something<br/>
&gt; similar to this would mitigate 99% of flames, judgementalisms, and<br/>
&gt; all that noise that has driven so many underground (and to their<br/>
&gt; chagrin is still present when they surface periodically).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When Jeremy Irish decided to use a GPS to mark box locations <br/>

the way <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing was done, rather he called it geocaching.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As a matter of historical record, Jeremy Irish neither invented<br/>
&gt; geocaching, nor coined the term.  Dave Ulmer and Matt Strom [sp?]<br/>
&gt; deserve those credits.  It is also a matter of historical record <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; geocaching was invented independent of letterboxing; in fact, I'm<br/>
&gt; not convinced its creator was aware of the hobby. (geocaching was<br/>
&gt; invented within days, and in direct response to, President Clinton's<br/>
&gt; executive order to disable selective availability).<br/>

<br/>
 Absolutely!! I agree with you 100%. I'm finding more and more around here<br/>
 (Central MA) that this is how series are being done--just one logbook in the<br/>
 last box. There are lots of them around here. The first series we planted<br/>
 had 4 boxes, with logbooks in all 4 boxes. After finding a few series that<br/>
 had logbooks in each box I realized that it was actually kinda annoying, so<br/>
 I pulled the middle two logbooks out of the boxes. We now have one logbook<br/>
 in the first and last box. That's kinda nice if the finder can't locate the<br/>
 final box. That happened to me once...with a Merry Pranksters box...but they<br/>
 were kind enough to give me enough of a hint that I found it the next time<br/>
 out. I was SO BUMMED not to find the last box that first time, b/c I had<br/>
 lots of comments I wanted to make (it is a cool series; Jigsaw Puzzle).<br/>
 However, despite my frustration that day, I still believe strongly that<br/>
 logbooks don't need to be in every box. Even as a planter, when I went back<br/>
 to that series I found that I had four logbooks with all the same stamps in<br/>
 them...in the same order. I really only need one.<br/>
<br/>
 So...I say GO FOR IT!!<br/>

 &gt;   I have been finding some interesting letterbox series plants, where<br/>
 &gt; the letterboxes lead you down a path and are planted at stratigic<br/>

 &gt; fun for the boxer. One thing though that I find gets old is signing<br/>
 &gt; the logbook at each box. Geocachers use muti caches in the same way,<br/>
 &gt; but put the log book at the final cache.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; I have been thinking about taking two boxes, adding two more and make<br/>
 &gt; a nice series out of them that would take a longer hike and make it a<br/>
 &gt; little more fun, especally those who have childern. However, I was<br/>
 &gt; thinking of planting smaller boxes, with clues and a stamp, but no<br/>
 &gt; logbook, saving the logbook for the last box. For some reason that<br/>
 &gt; makes more sense to me. I remember finding a series that have 13<br/>
 &gt; beatiful stamps, but they were spaced about 400 feet aprat (or less)<br/>
 &gt; and by the time I hit the last box I just stamped it, no comment.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; How do you guys feel about leaving the logbook for the last in a<br/>
 &gt; sseries as long as a stamp was included with each clue box.<br/>

Sort creating a small series.  It's always great to find a bonus! The bonus is not listed on either LbNA or atlasquest, so you really need to pay careful attention.  It's fun to note those who missed the bonus by not taking the time to look through the notes and stamps.  That is so much part of the fun for me - reading what others have said!  Also, I would have missed box 3 of a series of 5 that we went after.  Box 3 was missing from its original spot, but the boxers two or three before us noted that they found it scattered and broken so put it in a safe place until someone with adequate first aid supplies happened on the scene.  <br/>

 &gt; So I guess I have to ask myself, "if each box in a series<br/>
 &gt; does not warrant a logbook, is it necessary to plant each one?"<br/>
<br/>
 Hmmm.  I haven't planted a series; now that I think about it, this is <br/>
 probably a large reason why.  I have been thinking about a series or <br/>
 two, usually because there are two or more points of interest within <br/>
 the same park or the like, but even in those cases I'm more likely to <br/>
 create two separate letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
 It's not the length of the hike.  I've got a couple out there that <br/>
 involve a hike of a couple of miles or more.  I don't feel the need <br/>
 to plant intermediate boxes just to keep the interest up or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 One of the reasons I'd been thinking of planting a series is because <br/>
 I really want to bring people to a very particular spot, but there's <br/>
 nowhere there to plant a container large enough for a stamp and log <br/>
 book.  So my plan was to plant just a stamp with some instructions <br/>
 for finding a second box, somewhere nearby where a larger container <br/>
 can be hidden.  I had that one pretty well worked out when I came up <br/>
 with a way to hide a log book at the first site, so the series idea <br/>
 went away.<br/>

I've done it, but not well.  I didn't actually use a pencil because <br/>
the rubber is crumbly.  Instead, I used a vinyl eraser stick <br/>
(intended for use in an electric eraser used in drafting) mounted in <br/>
a holder intended to hold one.  It's one of those things made like a <br/>

of rubber, probably two inches long, gives it plenty of squish when <br/>
stamping.<br/>

The problem is, even though you can get a really small stamp and a <br/>
really small bit of paper inside a bison tube, how are you going to <br/>
expect finders to stamp in?  Do you expect every finder to fab up a <br/>
tiny pencil-eraser-sized sig stamp for the occasion?  Because one <br/>
stamping of your average sig stamp would fill all the paper that'd <br/>

&gt; Actually, around here (Upstate NY) I've found a few that had very<br/>
&gt; brief clues to bonus boxes written inside the cover of the logbook of<br/>
&gt; the published box.  Sort creating a small series.  It's always great<br/>
&gt; to find a bonus! The bonus is not listed on either LbNA or atlasquest,<br/>
&gt; so you really need to pay careful attention.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, sometimes they are.  They'll get listed as "mystery" boxes <br/>
on AQ, with no clues listed, just a note that it's there so finders <br/>
can log a bonus box.  The reason for listing is so finders can get <br/>
credit in their find totals.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; It's fun to note those<br/>
&gt; who missed the bonus by not taking the time to look through the notes<br/>
&gt; and stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah!  Sometimes you just flip to the first empty page and stamp <br/>
in, perhaps looking at the first page to see the placer and the <br/>
original stamp image.  If it's raining or hot or buggy we may not <br/>
flip through all the pages and may miss the mention of a bonus box.<br/>

It is a nice way to make a long hike more interesting and &gt; fun for the boxer. One thing though that I find gets old is signing &gt; the logbook at each box. Geocachers use muti caches in the same way, &gt; but put the log book at the final cache.So would it be acceptable also then if the planter only put a stamp inthe final box? I'm sure carving all those stamps is tedious to somepeople.While I know that the practice of putting the logbook only in the lastbox is becoming more common to "save time" and make it "lessbothersome" for the finder to have to stamp into each box along theway, I can't help thinking that this is simply another effort toshort-shift the letterboxing experience. After all, finding aletterbox, even if it is just one in a series, involves the stampingprocess -- and it is a two-way process which includes stamping the boxstamp into your log and stamping your stamp into the box log. This isa fundamental part of letterboxing.If you are only interested in finding boxes out in the woods withoutthe stamping process, perhaps the geocaching philosophy better fitsyour goals?Just my old-school perspective, which seems to be in the minoritythese days.SpringChick <br/>

Couldn't this problem be solved if you just didn't sign every log even if itis there? If you are doing a series and would prefer there not be a log ineach box just don't stamp the log until you get to the end. You can write inthat log that you found all the boxes and chose to only sign the last log.That gives the ones who want a log in each box the chance to stamp in ateach and the ones who don't can just wait until the end.TammyRock Hoppin' Mama <br/>

An Altoids tin and a rubber band work fabulously and fit into a pocket. I  <br/>
keep my sig stamp in an Altoids tin (it protects it well!), carry a favorite  <br/>

If you ever get into geocaching, you'll see a zillion applications of <br/>
this idea.  Of course, the vast majority just have a set of <br/>
coordinates in each "breadcrumb", just telling you where the next <br/>
breadcrumb is.  But some are very clever indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Some are nice enough to provide a stack of little slips of paper with <br/>
the coordinates to the next hide so you can just take one.  That, of <br/>
course, is very convenient, saves having to jot the info down and <br/>
eliminates the possibility of typos.  But you can print coordinates <br/>
on a very tiny bit of paper.  Stocking a letterboxing breadcrumb with <br/>
30 or so slips of paper with an adequate description of how to get to <br/>
the next hide would probably defeat the intention of using a bison <br/>
tube or something similarly tiny.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; While I still maintain that a "letterbox" technically must contain a<br/>
&gt; stamp and a logbook (just my opinion -- you have yours, I am entitled<br/>

<br/>
Of course it does!  Whenever a person says "The way <i>I'm</i> doing <br/>
it is proper, the way the rest of you are doing it is all wrong," <br/>
that makes him an elitist.  Wear the mantle proudly!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ooooh!  The stamp itself is the clue to the next hide!  Yeah, that'd <br/>
work!  Especially if the posted clues to the <i>first</i> hide takes <br/>
you past all the successive hides, so with each stamp you recognize <br/>
the location as a place you've already been!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do this, Kirbert and it really makes a difference! <br/>
&gt; I purchased a Lock &amp; Lock in a larger/longer size that<br/>
&gt; would accomodate the markers, stamp pads and stamps<br/>
&gt; that I choose to carry (even has extra room for a<br/>
&gt; baggie with a wet paper towel for clean-ups).  My sig<br/>
&gt; stamp is in a hand-made felt pouch that is easy to<br/>
&gt; slip the stamp in and out of.<br/>
<br/>
Too much time!  I think I'd use Velcro on the top of the sig stamp to <br/>
hold it to the lid, and a layer of felt in the bottom for it to land <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
Same kinda thing with the ink pad used for the sig.  Attach the lid <br/>
to the lid of the box, mount the pad itself in the base.<br/>
<br/>
Might even go farther than that and mount the sig stamp in the lid of <br/>
the ink pad so it just sits on the ink when closed up.  Does anyone <br/>
know if there's a reason not to do that?<br/>

Why don't you try it with all your boxes and then report back to the list a few years from now and let us know how it worked out for you?<br/>

We made that mistake while finding Mookie's Art &amp; Architecture. Luckily, the Mookster minimized the damage by placing the first and last stamps in the first box!  Way cool.  That way, when we found the second, we knew we had a composite image underway and only have one hole in our log book (where we stamped the eighth stamp two pages after the first before we figured it out!)  We learned not to be so 'organized' from that one!<br/>

   There is one series I'm aware of that the three stamps form one big <br/>
 alligator, all the way across the page. The three boxes are nowhere <br/>
 near each other, many miles apart in different parks; one of them is <br/>
 even in another county. The problem there is that you don't want to <br/>
 find the middle part of that alligator last; you can find it first or <br/>
 second, but not last. But the placer doesn't indicate which box <br/>
 contains the middle part, and because the boxes are so spread out and <br/>
 complete clues are provided for each, you might find them in any <br/>
 order depending on which direction you're driving through.<br/>

&gt; Within that one fine line is a world of difference...and if that <br/>
isn't true,<br/>
