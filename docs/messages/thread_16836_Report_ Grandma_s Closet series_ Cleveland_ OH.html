                    <div class="plaintext-content">I logged the Grandma's Closet Series in Cleveland/Rocky River/Lakewood on a <br/>
strangely warm Wednesday. Here are a couple of notes:<br/>
<br/>
Monday #1 is missing. The stump is empty.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find Monday #3. There were simply too many forks in the trail, <br/>
and the even cover of leaves on the ground made it impossible to find <br/>
anything that remotely looked like the right place.<br/>
<br/>
I was able to find all the other boxes in the other 3 series without too <br/>
much trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday #4 is completely soaked and the log needs to be replaced.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp for Wednesday #2 ("the source of the glow") is broken in half.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of notes: I think that the lids for the containers need to be <br/>
screwed on in non-childproof mode in order to  make a good watertight seal. <br/>
If they're replaced with the childproof lock in action, they don't seem to <br/>
be watertight. Most of the external plastic baggies were useless, since <br/>
they were usually torn and not offering much protection.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a fun series!<br/>
<br/>
