this box. I hiked for 2 hours with my 5yr old and everything made<br/>

I didn't find a Y shaped stump at 214 degrees. We had a great time,<br/>
but had to leave letterboxless :(<br/>
Please, is there any way of getting another clue??<br/>
I'm anxious to get back there and find that box!<br/>

a public forum, and an even bigger no-no for anyone to<br/>
offer it up publicly.<br/>
<br/>
The one place you can freely try for more clues is to<br/>
contact the placer.  Only he/she has the authority to<br/>
give you more information about a particular box.  But<br/>
there is no obligation to help you, or even respond.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you just remain "clueless" and that's part<br/>
of the journey.  Sometimes when you re-visit a site<br/>
with more experience under your belt, you have the<br/>
a-ha moment which can be very satisfying.  No one will<br/>
want to rob you of that lovely moment by sharing too<br/>
much too soon.  I have seen some entries in logbooks<br/>
that indicate it was the searcher's FOURTH time back<br/>
there looking for that box.  Don't you think they felt<br/>
TERRIFIC! at that point?<br/>
<br/>
Your 5 yo will learn valuable lessons about facing<br/>
challenges as well. We don't always "win." But two<br/>
hours in the woods for me is always a treat, box or<br/>
no.<br/>

involves "stumps" is likely looking very much<br/>
different.  Decay happens.  You can call these New<br/>
England boxes...look where there used to be a barn...I<br/>
mean a stump.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you have to use some creative imagination.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
You could also see if anyone else has found the box<br/>
recently and ask them [discretely, private email] if<br/>
they would give you a hint, or at least let you know<br/>
if you were on the right track].  BUT I DIDN'T SUGGEST<br/>
THAT!!!<br/>
