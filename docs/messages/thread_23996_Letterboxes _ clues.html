                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have had several good letterboxing outings this week, including a<br/>
very fun gathering last Saturday in Flower Mound, Texas.  Thanksgiving<br/>
was spent at home here in Houston with an ill child, so I'm happy that<br/>
we were able to go out and hit the trails (and go canoeing) today.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven't jumped into the fray about the clue sourcing.  So now, when<br/>
I'm feeling good and relaxed from our most enjoyable day, I guess I will.<br/>
<br/>
Just this week (which was an unusually heavy letterboxing week), we found:<br/>
-lots of boxes listed on either AQ or LBNA<br/>
-one box listed on a personal website<br/>
-one box with no clue at all<br/>
-a bonus box with no clues online (you have to find the parent box<br/>
where the clues are)<br/>
-a very elusive box that has been a goal of mine for nearly 6 months<br/>
-two boxes from a certain Texas boxer.  His MO is that you have to get<br/>
the clues from him in person. They are not posted online anywhere.  I<br/>
think this is charming.<br/>
--a box placed by a young girl, with help from her grandfather.  She<br/>
even made it into a mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Each of these boxes is different, as is each of the placers.  I love<br/>
it that we can so easily hunt down the clues for a lot of boxes, like<br/>
the ones we found today.  But, I love the extra layers to the onion<br/>
too--the clues that are illusive and mysterious and that you just<br/>
luckily and and sometimes randomly stumble onto one day.  I love it<br/>
when a clue to a box just drops into your email box or is handed to<br/>
you on a scrap of paper.  Or when you suddenly realize that something<br/>
has another meaning. . .and that you might want to look in a certain<br/>
place.  I enjoy boxes you have to work for in one way or another.  To<br/>
me, boxes that are less obvious are the scrumptious icing on the<br/>
letterboxing cake.  (onions and cake, yuk!)<br/>
<br/>
If I lived in Maine, I hope that I would have the opportunity to get<br/>
to know Phyto better and then she might willingly share her clues with<br/>
me.  And if not, I would happily find the ones that I did have clues<br/>
for and perhaps hide some for Phyto to find.<br/>
<br/>
. . .back to thinking up some more devious mystery box clues. . .you<br/>
may resume your discussion. . .I should really be plotting how to get<br/>
the kids back on their abandoned "school schedule" rather than<br/>
planning how to torture my fellow SE Texas letteboxers.<br/>
