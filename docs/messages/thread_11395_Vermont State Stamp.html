Directions: On RT.195 in Mansfield pull into the old Town Hall &amp;<br/>
Historical Society across from Spring Hill RD. Go to the back of the<br/>
building and park,then enter the blue blaze trail.(Don't forget the<br/>
clues for other great boxes like the Plane spotter,the bed rug,and<br/>
Inherit the earth.) Walk all the way down and in awhile you will come to<br/>
a wooden bridge,cross over and you will come to a T.You will turn right<br/>
here keep going and you will come to a place with a beautiful view.Go to<br/>
the clearing that has the best view, go over and take a moment to enjoy<br/>
the scenery.Now from where you are standing facing the view take reading<br/>
of 180 degrees,that should be to your left.their will be a stone wall<br/>
off a ways go over to it and walk down the back side of it. you will<br/>
come to a stump with a medium size tree next to it on the other side of<br/>
the tree opposite of the stump you will find your Vermont LB. in the<br/>
wall behind a stone door.The NeeDeeps.   <br/>
