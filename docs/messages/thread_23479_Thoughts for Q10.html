I think, rather than wasting questions on guessing further which county it's<br/>

There are also Trustees Reservations .. what other good hiking areas can we<br/>
think of that fall into a "category?"<br/>

<br/>
Hmmm....this should give me some thinking during my chores this a.m.<br/>
Anyone else with thoughts?   Remember we only have 10 questions left.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Not only do we need to narrow down the location (i.e. town) but we've got to<br/>
figure out which trail it may be off of, or what monument it's hidden near,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dang, it's not in my direct backyard.  Well, three counties, and you're <br/>
right Gretchen, Worcester is pretty vast.  I also agree that it is time <br/>
to really focus in on exact towns.  With only 1/2 the questions left, we <br/>
really need to think them through.<br/>
<br/>
I like the A-M suggestion.  I also like the idea of State parks.<br/>
<br/>
I am still worried, though, about the vast number of cities or towns <br/>
that are there.  Maybe one of the questions could be if it is in a city <br/>
(instead of a town).<br/>
<br/>
But that won't get us too far if it's in a town.  That'd still leave a <br/>
lot of towns.  How about if the question revolves around a certain list <br/>
such as the following question:<br/>
<br/>
Is it located along side a trail of one of the locations listed on the <br/>
following website? (http://www.mass.gov/dcr/recreate/hiking.htm)<br/>
<br/>
Or we could ask if it was on government owned land.  I think if we <br/>
listed the various different types of locations, we might miss a couple <br/>
of locations.  For example, we could miss places such as DW Field's Park <br/>
in Brockton (if it was in Plymouth County, I know it's not) since it is <br/>
a city owned park.  Or we could miss the Blue Hills Reservation since it <br/>
isn't technically a State Park.  The thought of using private <br/>
conservation areas might be a follow up question.<br/>
<br/>
One problem of my suggestion, though, is if it is under two rocks on <br/>
some street in some town, that could be construed as government owned <br/>
land.  Any thoughts on this?<br/>

Clarification: there are actually 11 questions left.<br/>

I don't think it's a good idea to ask about parks at this point. If you do and the answer is no then you really haven't narrowed the search much at all. This will eliminate Hopkinton State Park but will not eliminate Hopkinton. The maps will basically remain the same and you will have this same conversation again tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
You are still approaching this from the "where" point of view. As long as we are still trying to narrow the where, we should continue trying to eliminate half of the population. The city question or taking another shot at counties seems appropriate. <br/>
<br/>
Now, thinking outside the box, there is always the option of trying to find out the who or the why. Along with determining the correct question to ask, maybe we should start profiling the Ephemeral Letterboxer to determine who he or she really is and where would the most likely place this person might plant. This might help us to determine the best question.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree, one or two questions will definately pinpoint the county.  <br/>
After that 2, 3 or 4 question should pinpoint the town.  Once the <br/>
town is pinpointed, it may become more apparent where the box is.  <br/>
If it's a town with a large park, etc.  Even if it does take 6 <br/>
questions to pinpoint the town, there would definately be enough <br/>
questions left to get the area the box is planted in.  Asking <br/>
specific questions about parks or trails now would mostly likely be <br/>
a waste of a question until the area is further narrowed down <br/>
(IMHO).     <br/>
