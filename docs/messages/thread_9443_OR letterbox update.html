heading for retail Hell, I hit the trails. I hit Ryan's new Crappy Stamp Letterbox and will have to admit that this is a REALLY crappy <br/>
stamp! In fact, I am almost embarrassed to have it in my logbook... you've just gotta see it to believe. <br/>
<br/>
I then did maintenance on the Crystal Springs box whose logbook has been out for repairs. The poor thing got so waterlogged earlier <br/>
this year that the book was declared dead. However, all is well as of today. There were tons of migratory ducks on the pond, a great <br/>
day for twitchers. I next found that the Oaks Bottom box is indeed MIA. I will replace it shortly, perhaps this weekend. The Doyle <br/>
Owl is resting peacefully awaiting its next appearance. <br/>

&gt; shopping day I ran screaming in the opposite direction.<br/>
<br/>
I did what any full-blooded letterboxer would do.  I clipped that 50% <br/>
off coupon (good from 6:00am till 8:00am) for Michaels and headed off <br/>
to see what sort of letterboxing gear I could use it on!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Then I returned an hour later to use the 40% off coupon (good from <br/>
8:00am till 10:00am).  And returned another couple of hours later to <br/>
use the 30% off coupon (good from 10:00am till noon).  And <br/>
suprisingly enough, there weren't all that many people there!  Must <br/>
have been out letterboxing, I assume.  *shrug*  <br/>
<br/>
Then I spent the rest of the afternoon MAKING my own logbooks to hide <br/>
with my letterboxes.  Watch out world, because I will never be buying <br/>
a store-bought logbook again!  (Well, I still have ten or so I need <br/>
to finish using up, but after that, that's IT!  Only hand-made <br/>
logbooks from now on!)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I hit Ryan's new Crappy Stamp Letterbox and will have to admit that<br/>
&gt; this is a REALLY crappy stamp! In fact, I am almost embarrassed to<br/>
&gt; have it in my logbook... <br/>
<br/>
Great--then my job there is done.  I've never carved a stamp anyone's <br/>
been almost *embarrassed* to have in their logbooks!  =)<br/>

Dragon and Bishop's Close boxes and they are ready for action. I want to give kudos to Lillbit and Lottabit for being the ONLY <br/>
letterboxers who have successfully met up with the Dragon so far. Many have tried, and tried, but all others have failed. Maybe you <br/>
live such virtuous lives that the magic is with you.<br/>
