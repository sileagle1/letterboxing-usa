                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am so addicted to this now!  We were fortunate enough to be the <br/>
first to stamp in at the Stone Mountain Squeeeezebox in GA.  We've <br/>
found a hitchhiker, and my husband and I found another box on the way <br/>
home from work today.  The Bookworm box is excellent!  Very, very <br/>
clever.  Gives us all kinds of good ideas on where to hide some boxes <br/>
of our own.  I have our first one all ready to find a home, we just <br/>
have to decide where it's going.<br/>
<br/>
What are the "rules" on word-of-mouth clues?  I received an email <br/>
with a word-of-mouth clue, but unfortunately it is out of state and I <br/>
will not be headed back there any time soon.  Should I contact the <br/>
sender and ask if it's okay to send it along to others?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I asked this before, but didn't get an answer - Is the yahoo <br/>
email address just to this site?  For example, if someone emails <br/>
bassackwardsfrommd@yahoo.com where does it go?  I tried sending a <br/>
test email to my yahoo email address, but can't find it anywhere.  <br/>
Any help on this would be greatly appreciated.  I'm so confused! :)<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
YES- please contact the sender to ask permission before passing along any word of mouth clues.  The placement of the box might only be intended for a few and not the masses (special birthday boxes intended for only family and friends are one example).<br/>
