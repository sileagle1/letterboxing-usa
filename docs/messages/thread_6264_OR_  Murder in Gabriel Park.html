<br/>
Don't feel bad.  I have yet to obtain this series, too.  My mate and I<br/>
walked and searched high and low and came away with nothing.  However, I<br/>
know they must be there because lots of local letterboxers have nabbed<br/>
this bunch of stamps.  One of these days we will have to go back and try<br/>
for this series again.  Ryan can be very clever at hiding his<br/>
letterboxes, so when you do find them, it is a source of real<br/>
accomplishment.  Hang in there, go for some easier letterboxes to keep<br/>
your letterboxing mood bouyant then try for the Murder boxes some other<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like, with many letterboxes around here, it takes me three<br/>
times till I'm successful.  This was true of Der Mad Stamper's Mt. Tabor<br/>
and Multnomah Falls letterboxes.  Tough to figure some of these things<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
I try to make my letterboxes easy to find, so that people won't be<br/>
disappointed or won't have to think too much to obtain them.  Sometimes<br/>
they come up missing, though, but most are usually still in tact, I<br/>
believe.<br/>
<br/>
