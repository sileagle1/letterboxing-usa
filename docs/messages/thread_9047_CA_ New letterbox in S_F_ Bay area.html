<br/>
By Lizardbutt's Family<br/>
Location: Alameda Creek Regional Trail in Fremont, CA<br/>
Clue difficulty: easy<br/>
Terrain: easy to hike, but Lizardbutt says, "better to bike it".<br/>
Directions to Coyote Hills can be found at <br/>
www.ebparks.org/parks/coyote.html<br/>
There is a fee for parking. Please park at the visitor center.<br/>
<br/>
Bayview is the way to go.<br/>
Lizards on rocks you will pass. <br/>
Alameda Creek is where you must go.<br/>
Down the hill and around to the right sits the old man on his bike.<br/>
He hides under the rocks just off to the right and watches young <br/>
cyclists zoom on by.<br/>
Now, away from the bay is the way to go.<br/>
The Corps of Engineers-US Army have been here, too.<br/>
Close to a bench that makes a great place to rest.<br/>
Further on down on the right is where Crash ran into Mr. Oak.<br/>
Mr. Oak sits alone in the group waiting and wondering who will come <br/>
next.<br/>
For there sits a surprise that he guards day and night tucked under a <br/>
pillow of leaves and thick bark.<br/>
Now, further on down find the "X" that doesn't mark the spot.<br/>
A grove of eucalyptus trees means you are close.<br/>
Nestled in a cradle is what you desire.<br/>
If you wish to know stand on the "X".<br/>
The visitor's center will be at 165 degrees. <br/>
The Indian hut at the historic site is at 140 degrees. Lizardbutt <br/>
says that the outhouse by the historic site isn't the hut. Mission <br/>
Peak is at 90 degrees.<br/>
Off on the left looking out at the creek and suspended halfway up in <br/>
the bush is what you seek.<br/>
Further on down before you meet Dust there sits the Evergreens off on <br/>
the right.<br/>
Evergreen one looks good to some with its arms reaching down to the <br/>
ground. <br/>
But Evergreen two has a surprise for you hidden down in his trunks. <br/>
Now you are done, and we hope you had fun.  <br/>
