Located on Sugarloaf Mountain<br/>
Marquette, Michigan<br/>
Marquette County<br/>
Terrain:  Climbing a 315 foot hill, but with stairs to help.<br/>
Difficulty:  Easy as long as you can handle stairs or modest <br/>
climbs.   Family oriented. <br/>
<br/>
Sugarloaf Mountain is one of the "must see" places on any trip to the <br/>
Marquette area.  A 20 minute climb through beautiful pine and birch <br/>
forests brings you to a lookout with spectacular views of Marquette, <br/>
Lake Superior, and the Huron Mountains.  The two trails to the top <br/>
(an "easy" trail-- with stairs, and a "difficult" trail-- shorter but <br/>
steeper) are well-marked and well-maintained.  Sugarloaf is on County <br/>
Road 550, the road to Big Bay, about five miles northwest of downtown <br/>
Marquette.  There is a large parking lot at the base of the mountain.<br/>
