the McKeldin Library box and also the correction to<br/>
Testudo's Hideout.  The very last turn should be a<br/>
LEFT not a RIGHT.  The fully corrected text follows<br/>

READ, DON'T RIOT!<br/>
This would be an excellent start or end to fiding<br/>
Testudo's hideout.  <br/>
Go to the top floor of the library.  You need to find<br/>
the Periodical Stacks (PERSTKs).  What you are looking<br/>
for can be found between shelf ranges number 54 and<br/>
55.    When you find the correct shelf, walk 9 paces<br/>
along the stack and look on your left.  The first<br/>
shelf from the bottom should hold T1.S5.  Look for the<br/>
issues from 1965-1965.  The letterbox is hidden on the<br/>
empty shelf directly underneath.  Feel along the<br/>
bottom of the shelf holding Scientific American above.<br/>

Testudos Hideout<br/>

<br/>
This begins at the Testudo Memorial statue (in front<br/>
of McKeldin Library) on Campus.  Because he was<br/>
embarassed at last year's basketball riots, Testudo<br/>
(the Terrapins' mascot) decided to hide during this<br/>
year's basketball season.  He turned left and and<br/>
walked 54 turtle paces.  He then turned left again.<br/>
It was hard, but he made it up the 2 flights of<br/>
stairs.  He saw a picnic table on his right, but this<br/>
was no time to rest!!!    At the 3 way fork he took<br/>
the middle route.  He saw a black box on the left and<br/>
decided to hide there, but when he saw that it was<br/>
surrounded by 13 trees (unlucky) he kept movin<br/>
straight across the street.  He stopped to rest but<br/>
then saw a sign saying that he could be fined for even<br/>
stopping!  He went straight over the brick path.  He<br/>
turned right and saw his friend Benjamin.  Benajmin<br/>
said he knew of some hiding places just ahead.  At the<br/>
end of the bricks, Testudo turned right.  He stopped<br/>
at the intersection; in front of him were two more big<br/>
boxes great for hiding, but just to his left were 5<br/>
scary guys standing on top of each other.  He turned<br/>
left again, and eventually he saw a pretty white tree<br/>
on the left surrounded by a pretty green fence, but<br/>
there was not enough to hide behind so he kept moving.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When he arrived at the edge of the parking lot, he saw<br/>
his friend JJ.  JJ said that just behind him in the<br/>
distance there was a white and green tower.  Surely<br/>
there would be some hiding places near there.  Testudo<br/>
carefully walked through the parking lot keeping his<br/>
eye on the tower.  WHen he reached the end of the<br/>
parking lot he saw a small creek and a footbridge.<br/>
Just as he crossed the footbridge, he saw 2 giant<br/>
fish.  They told him to follow the black path until it<br/>
turned light brown.  From there he should turn LEFT<br/>
and he would be able to see 2 hiding places.  He did.<br/>
They were both a little bit off in the distance.  They<br/>
were both silver; one was boxy and boring, the other<br/>
was curly, elaborate and very modern looking.  He<br/>
couldn't believe he found such a place on CAMPUS.  It<br/>
was fit for a king or a PRESIDENT.  He nestled in on<br/>
lower right corner of the North side. <br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet.  This is a very public place.<br/>
Maybe, take the box back to the picnic tables nearby.<br/>
Have fun; if you find Testudo's hideout (or find that<br/>
it's missing) drop us an e-mail at themobots@yahoo.com<br/>
