&gt; What does everyone think?<br/>

Why not keep a record in your logbook? Every time you find a letterbox <br/>
or plant one just mark down the number next to the stamp image. That <br/>
way you will know exactly how many you have found, planted, exchanged, <br/>
Hitch Hikers, and event stamps you have gathered if that is your goal. <br/>
I see the listing at LBNA as being a way to mark those letterboxes <br/>
that you have found so that you do not have to check the clues to see <br/>
if you have already found them. It also lets others know if someone <br/>
has found those particular boxes recently.<br/>

I have to agree with Don (but then, I usually do)-a<br/>
pencil system is probably the most effective way to<br/>
keep a count.  Of course, there may be folks here who<br/>
aren't totally techno-dependent and slightly OCD like<br/>
I am, so they might disagree with me.<br/>
<br/>
I don't keep a count of my finds at all (okay, I get a<br/>
wild hair about every six months that I'm going to see<br/>
where I stand, so I start counting and I get so wound<br/>
up over how to count all my stamps that it isn't worth<br/>
the stress of it to me and I quit trying - for another<br/>
six months).  But if I were to keep count, I know that<br/>
if I relied entirely on the computer count, I would<br/>
then make myself completely nuts trying to find a way<br/>
to verify the count, audit its accuracy, and refine my<br/>
system.  I'm an accountant by trade, so maybe that has<br/>
something to do with my manic approach to counting<br/>
(picture me as a female version of The Count on Sesame<br/>
Street - "Onnnnne lovely stamp - twoooooo lovely<br/>
stamps....999 lovely stamps - hahahahaha!!!).  So I<br/>
don't count.  But IF I did, I would make a simple<br/>
little penciled in number/letter combination next to<br/>
each stamp, or possibly a hash mark system at the<br/>
bottom of each page.  <br/>
<br/>
One reason I know I would count that way is because I<br/>
letterbox instead of geocache because it takes me a<br/>
little further out of the high-tech world.  True, I<br/>
have to go on the internet to get my clues (Hey! Maybe<br/>
that's one reason I like the idea of WOM clues!), but<br/>
beyond that, the carving is by my own hand, the making<br/>
of the box is mine, following the clues involves using<br/>
only the (debatably) good senses and minimal equipment<br/>
I can carry with me.  Letterboxing is my own little<br/>
corner of the world that technology only touches<br/>
minimally - otherwise I live and survive by the<br/>
computer, the cell phone, and the fax machine.  But we<br/>
are now down to only four computers in the house, I<br/>
quit the job that required I carry one pager and<br/>
sometimes two, I've given my Palm Pilot away, and I've<br/>
learned to do math using a slide rule - just to prove<br/>
I can.  Life is just too good to be dictated by<br/>
technology.<br/>
<br/>
And uhhh...I had better go - I just got a pop-up to<br/>
remind me to pick up my son!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not a counter either. My focus in letterboxing has generally been the search. I love all the interesting places I've found through the letterboxing experience that I would never have otherwise known about. The stamp is definitely icing on the cake. I just love interesting clues and a really great stamp. I think I may have a character flaw that would cause me to focus too much on the count if I really started paying attention to that, then I would lose the enjoyment I have of the experience! Recently when there was discussion of the 100+ box, I did a quick count and found I had well exceeded the requirement, but then found the box was not available anyway.... so now I'm back to my "no count world". It works for me.<br/>

This usually happened senior year, and not everyone made the grade. There<br/>
were no hand-held calculators; we did ALL math with a pencil, some paper,<br/>

While still in high school, I worked at McDonald's as a cashier. I wanted to<br/>
work the grill, but we didn't have Equal Rights then, and the grill was<br/>
considered "a man's job". So, I was provisionally hired as a cashier.  In<br/>
order to keep my job, I had to memorize a price chart for each menu item ( 1<br/>
burger .39; 2 burgers .78, etc.); the chart went from 1 to 20 for each item.<br/>
I also had to take a test to prove I could add. When I took an order, I<br/>
added up the order in my head while I was bagging it. I then entered the<br/>
total on the cash register, added in the sales tax from the tax chart taped<br/>
on my machine, and totaled the order. I counted out the change (the machine<br/>
did not calculate how much to give back). <br/>

The 'Deer-in-the-headlights' look, unfortunatley, happens more than <br/>

When I was in high school, I worked in my parents'<br/>
garden center and we sold seed to farmers.  We had at<br/>
least 50 varieties of seed that we regularly sold and<br/>
many more types that weren't so common.  With the<br/>
common seed, I knew how much a small, medium, and<br/>
large scoop of each cost (based on knowing how much<br/>
each weighed, since they were sold either by the ounce<br/>
or by the pound).  I could usually wait on two or<br/>
three farmers at a time and keep their orders<br/>
straight, and give them an accurate total, throwing in<br/>
whatever plants and chemicals they might also<br/>
purchase, and I would calculate sales tax on the<br/>
taxable portion to boot (of course, that was when it<br/>
was an even 5%!).  In this day of "multi-tasking", I<br/>
could not begin to do the same thing, but back then it<br/>
was just good service!  I guess I've burned a few too<br/>
many brain cells at this point in my life because I<br/>
know I couldn't begin to do it now ... fortunately, it<br/>
isn't something I would have to do in letterboxing<br/>
these days.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing my dad taught me to do that has come<br/>
in really handy in letterboxing is to judge rise and<br/>
slope without equipment.  That's pretty cool to know!<br/>
