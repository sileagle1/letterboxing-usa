                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, reading some of these old posts has brought back some fantastic <br/>
memories, especially my over whelming fondness for dead lemurs and <br/>
all things lemuresque.  <br/>
<br/>
The ADG is not dead!  We were merely in an extended hibernation and <br/>
have only recently awakened to find that letterboxes are still around <br/>
but somehow the bees have all gone.  What's up with that?<br/>
<br/>
Apologies to all who seek our old boxes to find them missing, <br/>
waterlogged, or just plain trashed.  Feel free to adopt at will.  If <br/>
we ever decide to get back in the game we'll track you down to check <br/>
up on our old babies.  Or contact me at adglbna@aol.com if you have a <br/>
rogue book or stamp as we'd love to see them. I'm actually kind of <br/>
stunned that any have survived this long.<br/>
<br/>
The ADG is headed for a 10 day Oregon jaunt in a week and a half and <br/>
I have been busily printing off clues to boxes on the Oregon Coast <br/>
between Coos Bay and Lincoln City.  Sarah, ADG 3, grew up in Oregon <br/>
and is excited to show us her old haunts.  Our trip starts at Crater <br/>
Lake which still has 40 inches of snow!  <br/>
<br/>
So the big question, does the list drama continue?  And how is the <br/>
old crew doing?  We still keep in touch with Poison Ivy and Lady <br/>
Prisspot but have lost touch with Squirrel, Firefly, Pyschomommy, and <br/>
the rest of the crew.  What's up you freaky people?<br/>
<br/>
A couple of ADG fun facts to catch you up on the last few years:<br/>
<br/>
1. You take the blond and we'll take the one in the turban.<br/>
2. You can never kill a lemur enough, they're resourceful little <br/>
buggers.<br/>
3. It's really hard to make Poison Ivy cry.  If you happen to be <br/>
extremely good at card games and live in the DC tri-state area please <br/>
contact me.  I've been trying for the last few years to defeat Poison <br/>
Ivy at cards so I can dip my cookies in his tears but to date all <br/>
efforts have been soundly thrashed.<br/>
4. Lady Prisspot will eat gummy anything!  <br/>
