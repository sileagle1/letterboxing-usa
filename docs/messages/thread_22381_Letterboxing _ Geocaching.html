I believe I found the link <br/>

also ready to place a box, <br/>

You can submit your own logo (1" x 2.5") in 300 dpi image file.  Its  <br/>
not too large but its precise and neat.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, Brenda! And welcome to the group!! You don't have to be a good carver to<br/>
place a box. We just had a discussion about this on the Texas list, and most<br/>
of us feel that the total experience is what's important: planning the trip,<br/>
the hike, following the clues, finding the box (yippeee!), checking the log<br/>
book to see who else has been there, stamping in (adding one more F to the<br/>
count), and finally, the stamp itself. Lots of us are beginning carvers. We<br/>
tend to carve very simple stamps. Veteran carvers assure us that the more we<br/>
carve the better we will get. Also, there is no rule that says you can't use<br/>
a store-bought stamp. <br/>
<br/>
A word of warning: sometimes I have seen flaming on this site over the<br/>
hand-carved stamp issue (and other things as well). My advice: ignore any<br/>
response to your posts that is not supportive and encouraging, and JUST HAVE<br/>
FUN!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>

JOY of TeamTexUS<br/>

<br/>
In addition to the coordinates provided, there are also clues on the cache description page which will often hone in or specify a precise location once you reach the area.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the thrill for me in geocaching is actually having to locate the container.  It can be designed to blend in with the environment and be easily overlooked by passersby who might otherwise dispose of it or demolish it.  This allows caches to be hidden practically anywhere (within the guidelines) and offer little or no chance of it being tossed by someone not familiar with the sport.<br/>
<br/>
Concerning the trading of trinkets and such, I don't trade.  Its optional and the folks I know don't trade unless they happen to be with their children and the kids eye something they like.  It helps teach the value of trading and a bit of the honor system (trade even, trade up, or don't trade at all).<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing and geocaching are definitely different and each is appealing to different folks for different reasons.  I like both of them very much but for entirely different reasons.<br/>
