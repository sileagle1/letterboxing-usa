                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just discovered today what part of the problem is with some of the <br/>
letterbox links on the Rhode Island site.  I posted a question about <br/>
the RI Wolf Mystery last week, saying that I couldn't get the clues <br/>
to load.  Someone else responded that they could.  Others have had <br/>
problems with other clues on this site.  Today I discovered that if <br/>
you use Internet Explorer they load fine, but older versions of <br/>
Netscape won't allow them to load.  I've been using Netscape 4.7_ for <br/>
awhile now with no problems, but now it appears that it isn't working <br/>
correctly.  With the RI Wolf Myster, for instance, I just get a blank <br/>
dark brown page (like the website background).  Anyone else having <br/>
this problem?<br/>
