week (see "Other International").  But while I'm at it, I wanted to make a<br/>
pitch for safety and another for use of museum erasers.<br/>
<br/>
The safety angle became very clear to us when terrorists detonated bombs in<br/>
London.  All of Europe was edgy and both the Bobbies in England and the<br/>
Gardia in Ireland were not in the mood for casual talk about hiding<br/>
letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all must increase our sense of grace, our skill at stealth and<br/>
our use of common sense in these uncommon times.  Those who hide and those<br/>
who seek must take extra care.<br/>
<br/>
On a more pleasant note, we found that most European museums sell<br/>
logo-emblazoned erasers in their gift shops.  Some are even shaped.  They<br/>
make wonderful specialty stamps.<br/>
