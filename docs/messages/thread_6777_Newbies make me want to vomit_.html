I noticed that you became a member today! So, that makes you a <br/>
newbie, also. I suggest that you go out and try hunting for a couple <br/>
of boxes. The fresh air will do you some good. And you may discover <br/>
the magic of letterboxing.<br/>

1. The date one becomes a member means nothing, Newbie.<br/>
2. I have hunted many more boxes than you, Newbie.<br/>
3. Professional help will do you better than fresh air. Don't delay.<br/>
4. I discovered the magic of letterboxing LONG before you slithered in here<br/>
and decided you didn't like the format, Newbie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have done with me what you did when you entered into this group.<br/>
<br/>
You have made rude assumptions and have no respect for the work of many in<br/>
the few short years Letterboxing has been in America. You show no respect<br/>
for tradition, short lived it may be.<br/>
