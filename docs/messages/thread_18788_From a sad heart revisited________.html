appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
With that said, I'm pleased to announce that the new site is back up and running.  You'll have to excuse the construction dust,<br/>
there's no content yet, but we are open to accept new users.  I'm going to recreate the Forums, because , as Ryan pointed out once,<br/>
he didn't see them 'taking' off, though I personally like the idea of the forums, it gives you better access to the messages and it<br/>
allows you to watch what you want to watch and be notified of new messages, if you choose, without having to wade through the latest<br/>
flame war.  But that's just me.  Having been around mailing lists since 1994 and having run forums elsewhere for quite some time,<br/>
I'm not saying your experience with a  forum would be better or worse, I'm just saying it would be linear.  Plus, forums don't allow<br/>
spam attacks. You know. Where someone joins with a fake address (Or worse yet, makes an instant email address at Yahoo or one of the<br/>
other Web based sites) and instantly spams an ad for a way for you to get a particular body part to enhance and enlarge (For either<br/>
females or males!).  I think mailing lists are wonderful but they lend themselves to the problems we've seen recently.<br/>
<br/>
The Letterbox Clue database was not damaged and will be restored as soon as I can convert it to the new software.<br/>
<br/>
The security flaw in the original software does not exist in the new software that's been installed and, as amazing as it seems,<br/>
someone is still probing to see if that bug exists, along with attempted Syn Attacks and DoS (Denial of Service) attacks.  It's<br/>
actually pretty funny, once you think about it.  The IP address of the person originating those recent attacks as well as the one<br/>
that did get through has been reported.  Ah well, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on you.<br/>
<br/>
So, we're back, bigger and better, faster and stronger, than before. (Sounds like the six million dollar Man, eh?  (grin))<br/>
<br/>
Come by, take a look, be a part of a community.<br/>

You know, that's almost insulting.  I love forums and hate Yahoo <br/>

You're surprised?  =)  Every system on the face of the planet <br/>
probably suffers from hackers.  If it's attached to the Internet, <br/>
there will always be someone, somewhere who wants to hack in.  You <br/>
might be able to put a fake "This house is guarded by XYZ Security <br/>
system" on your lawn to fool a few people, but there's a lot of <br/>
smart people out there who won't fall for something so trivial and <br/>
will try hacking in using exactly the methods you tell them won't <br/>
work.<br/>

<br/>
No, it's not even close to almost insulting, it's way off.  Sorry if you've not yet had your coffee this morning, but please don't<br/>
read into my words Rayn. I'm not trying to insult you at all, and I really don't want to waste the time to try and insult you, I<br/>
have much better things to do.  And, to be specific, I was making a direct quote. You sepcifically said that you didn't see the<br/>
Forums taking off at all.  You said it, I quoted it. And it's not to blame you at all or even insult you. I've got better thigns to<br/>
do with my time than try and get your goat Ryan.  Please stop taking my words as a slap in your face or anything else.  I was simply<br/>
statting that, as you pointed out, since they hadn't taken off, then I could restart them without fear of losing everything.  I'll<br/>
pull some of the stuff out of the database and recreate them, but over all, I'm just going to restart the Forums.  Sorry if it came<br/>
out any other way, I'm sure you can understand the stress I'm under right now.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Becuase you just answered your own question. I beleive them to be more immune from the Spam Attacks that mailing lists suffer from<br/>
becuase of the nature of the Forum, VS the nature of the Mailing list. And becuase, as any good administrator that's been doning<br/>
this for quite some time, the public can NOT post to the forums.  Standard procedure, at least for any forum I've ever run.  So,<br/>
that's why I said that.  But thank you for questioning it Ryan.<br/>

No, actually I'm surprised that we think so differently, or, better yet, that you've decided to read what I say differently than<br/>
it's intended. I was not expressing surprise over the fact that my server was still being probed from the very same IP address that<br/>
instigated the original attack.  In that aspect, I can see why my words didn't not come across as I intended them, however, I really<br/>
don't need you tell me that every system on the Internet is vulnerable to attacks or probing.  This is my career, remember?  Before<br/>
working at Intel, I was a GreyHat for Siegeworks out of California.  System security and prevention was my bread an butter.  And<br/>
yet, even as good as I thought I was, I still got hacked. So, I'm not at all surprised that it happened or is still happening, but<br/>
that it's the same person.  And, frankly, who that person is.  But, that's of no nevermind.<br/>
<br/>
To answer your first letter, asking how it happened, I'll say this much... They used a Union Jack SQL Insertion to get past a bug in<br/>
the SQL routines of the software that I was using. And, since the version I used was vulnerable and the next release that fixed it<br/>
had yet to come out, unless you paid for it, I got hacked. And it's mainly my fault, I never took the time to secure it myself, had<br/>
to many other pressing things to take care of.  You know, once I get Around To It.  ;)<br/>
