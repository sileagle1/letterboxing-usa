If anyone is interested in wildflowers,  I just have to share this. I <br/>
got to find Northern Pitcher-plants for the first time in my life and <br/>
quite by accident.  They are so beautiful and even though Bluebird is <br/>
going to report on our great day of boxing,  [we found a good amount of <br/>
the R.I. boxes] and she will tell you about them.  I was afraid that she <br/>
would forget to tell you about Sarracenia  If anyone wants to learn more <br/>
about  them or just talk about them  you may e mail me off line.<br/>
A happy Butterfly :-)<br/>
