                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found 2 boxes on May 1 and one box that the area was <br/>
underconstruction.  The site wouldn't accept the info to credit me with <br/>
the boxes.  I emailed the members who placed the boxes but haven't <br/>
heard anything from them.  That is why i am trying to set up a web page <br/>
for myself so i can keep track of boxes and have directions to boxes i <br/>
hide here in Massachusetts.<br/>
Thank you all for your help where i am new.<br/>
