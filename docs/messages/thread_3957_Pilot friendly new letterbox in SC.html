Placed December 17, 2001<br/>
Commemorates man's first powered flight<br/>
<br/>
Advisories:<br/>
- near airport - AVOID ALL RESTRICTED AREAS<br/>
- very easy access<br/>
- accessible by pilots (i.e. no car) as well as those driving to the <br/>
starting point.<br/>
<br/>
Start:<br/>
Find FBO counter at MYR. Turn 180 degrees and pause at the "Nortons' <br/>
Memorial".  Go to nearest water fountain and take the nearest exit <br/>
from the building.  Go straight to Airdrome Avenue and follow it <br/>
to "Huger".  Turn left on Huger and wander past the 'ultimate pizza' <br/>
(but don't expect to eat).  Next you'll pass the biggest 'fox' you've <br/>
EVER seen until you start 'shining'.  Turn right and "shine on".  <br/>
Instead of the Harvest Moon, however, look for the three-posted <br/>
wooden fence.  "Wright Stuff" is located at the farthest post on <br/>
the "Wright"!<br/>
Hope you all have fun finding this box and please pause to <br/>
contemplate what our world would be like without those like the <br/>
Wright Brothers AND the Nortons.<br/>
