                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yay!!  I do love that stamp too.  =-)  I was so excited to do that <br/>
one since being introduced to In-N-Out Burger-yummy!!!  =-) <br/>
<br/>
Can you believe that when I placed this box the In-N-Out Burger truck <br/>
was off loading supplies before it opened...I thought I'd be there <br/>
with no one around.  Anyhow, as I tried to not to stand out and <br/>
placed the box in its spot, I needed something more to secure it.  Oh <br/>
yeah-that awesome rock was sitting out in the blue about 20 feet away <br/>
next to a lonely little tree. =-)  I wanted to do a little <br/>
letterboxing dance, but decided that would draw too much attention to <br/>
me as I nabbed that rock and shoved it in the bushes.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you enjoyed it.  I was hesitant in posting that I placed <br/>
more boxes as I wasn't sure if folks were getting tired of my posting <br/>
the boxes I placed.  So thus you didn't find out sooner than you <br/>
did.  I guess I'll post when I place more.  Thanks again for finding <br/>
some of my boxes.  Have fun this weekend.  <br/>

the In N Outs are located--NOW THERE'S A LETTERBOX THERE TOO???  Hee <br/>
Haw!!!<br/>
<br/>
We have stopped at this particular In N Out Burger dozens of times--<br/>
if only we could get a chance to get back down there sometime soon <br/>
to nab the box, too.  :(<br/>
<br/>
I think every travelling Pacific Northwest letterboxin' fool knows <br/>
where the most northern In N Out Burger is--perhaps it needs a <br/>
letterbox, too?  Funhog's Riverside Rest is close--but not close <br/>
enough...  ;)<br/>
