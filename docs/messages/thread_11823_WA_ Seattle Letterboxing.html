Was out letterboxing this morning in this GORGEOUS weather. (there is <br/>
a reason that I live here and commute 2,000+ miles to Philly)<br/>
Got two letterboxes and 1 hitchhiker (of course)<br/>
<br/>
I was sooo surprised that I was only the 2nd person at The Story's <br/>
End Letterbox. It is fantastic. I always take any visitors to Seattle <br/>
to that location anyway. In fact, last time Ryan Carpenter was here, <br/>
we went down there!! Even though there wasn't a letterbox around <br/>
there then!!! :-) So all you Seattlelites need to RUN don't walk to <br/>
that letterbox. (I'm dancing away with the hitchhiker that was hidden <br/>
there--more on that on the hitchhiking chat board) The hosts of the <br/>
letterbox were very excited to have someone ask for it! So don't be <br/>
shy. <br/>
