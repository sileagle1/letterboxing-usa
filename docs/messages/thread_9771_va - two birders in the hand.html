Taking advantage of the mild weather (almost 60 degrees in December -- gotta <br/>
like that!) the BeMa team headed off minus one member who is recovering from <br/>
a back injury.  We headed back to the Ellinor C. Lawrence park (oddly <br/>
enough, the only park we've letterboxed at without Da being present).  We <br/>
parked in the pond parking lot.  That's the third different parking lot for <br/>
our third box in this park, interesting....  Just a short jaunt later and we <br/>
happily held two bird(er)s box in the hand!  What an official looking stamp! <br/>
  Like that hand hold!<br/>
<br/>
Happy to have thus escaped the threatening rain, we started off in search of <br/>
the Bump on a Log box.  Although we dodged one type of water, we soon needed <br/>
to abandon our quest in order to seek out waters of another kind (one to <br/>
drink and one to flush)  That's what happens when your team is aged in the <br/>
single digits...<br/>
<br/>
All was not lost though!  We found a nearby water fountain and bathroom at <br/>
our favorite custard place down the road.  AND -- it was malted milk as the <br/>
flavor of the day!  It just doesn't get any better than that!!!  Many drips <br/>
on the chin, shirt and pants later, we headed back home with a large cup of <br/>
custard for the recuperating Da.  A happy day for BeMaNaDa (Ha stayed out in <br/>
the yard hiding her brand new bone somewhere....)<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  We were really excited to find our 25th stamp!  No hitchhikers yet but <br/>
a lot had been at the Two Birders box before us.<br/>
