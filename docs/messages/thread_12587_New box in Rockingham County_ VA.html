This is my first box that I planted.<br/>
<br/>
Wild Butterfly<br/>

County: Rockingham<br/>
Nearest city: Harrisonburg<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>

Clues<br/>
Take Exit 240 which is the Mt. crawford and Bridgewater exit and turn <br/>
towards Bridgewater. You will go through one traffic light with a <br/>
Burger King on the left. Follow the road through Bridgewater College <br/>
to another traffic light and turn left onto Route 42 and turn right <br/>
onto West Bank Street. You will see signs for Wildwood Park.<br/>
<br/>
Once in Wildwood park in the parking lot. The entrance to the park is <br/>
on the right and you will need to cross the bridge. You will need to <br/>
be discreet because this park is very busy. When you are on the <br/>
bridge you might want to notice how many planks wide the bridge is <br/>
because you might need that information later. Exit off the bridge to <br/>
the right and walk towards the walkway. There are some signs along <br/>
the pathway that you might want to read for interest. Once you find <br/>
the Hummingbird/Butterfly and know your address, you are well on your <br/>
way. As you travel along the pathway, you will want to keep going <br/>
until you see a very tall and straight dead tree on the right. You <br/>
will need to turn around and count the number of steps from the <br/>
planks on the bridge. Finally, look 25 degrees and you will find the <br/>
Wild Butterfly behind a twisty tree under some branches.<br/>
<br/>
Please e-mail me at mmoomaw@bridgewater.edu to let me know the boxes <br/>
condition. Happy Letterboxing!!<br/>
