                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got word today that the stamp is missing out of my Alumnae <br/>
Letterbox, a mystery box in Maryland.<br/>
If anyone around here has been to that box recently and maybe <br/>
accidently walked off with the stamp, I'd really like it back.  Saves <br/>
me from having to carve a new one!  Plus, this box is near and dear <br/>
to my heart for a few reasons.<br/>
If anyone around here was planning on searching for that box, this <br/>
will also serve to warn you that the stamp is missing.<br/>
I really wonder what some people are thinking when they do things <br/>
like that.  I'd like to think it was an accident, and not some idiot <br/>
thief.  I'd have thought they'd take the whole box if that was the <br/>
case.  So, I'm hoping that someone will realize they have my stamp <br/>
and return it.  Please!  <br/>
I've also gotten word that the Bassackwards Box #1 needs a new <br/>
logbook, but since we've now got a three month old daughter (yay!), <br/>
box maintenance has been low on the priority list.  I sure miss <br/>
boxing though!<br/>
And we're still waiting for word that someone has seen the Little <br/>
Biker Hitchhiker we released in New York last year.  It's gone MIA.<br/>
