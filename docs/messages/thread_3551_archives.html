I guess I didn't phrase my question clearly.The link to new letterboxes <br/>
from September on the bottom of the What's New page is what's not <br/>
working. I can access all the postings from the above URL but I'm only <br/>
looking for the new letterboxes. Funhog<br/>

the southern New England pages are suffering. Our system isn't that <br/>
old, but it seems to have epileptic bronchitis. It'll give a <br/>
miserable little cough and then have a seizure, throwing us off line <br/>
and loosing all the work we'd done on the pages. We haven't yet found <br/>
the right medicine to make it feel better...<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we'll get this all sorted out soon,<br/>

&gt;Greetings,<br/>
&gt;Yesterday I sent in the clues for a new letterbox in Washington, CT. <br/>
&gt;This is<br/>
&gt;the first one in this part of the state. Did you get the clues? When <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;they be posted?<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
