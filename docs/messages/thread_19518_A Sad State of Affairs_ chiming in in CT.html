<br/>
We were out boxing our way across CT to our family's house this past <br/>
weekend ... excitedly our F200!!  Tho we are not as experienced as <br/>
other boxers, we do appreciate the care and time (no matter how many <br/>
bugs smashed) it takes to replace a found box.  We were a bit taken <br/>
back to see familiar blue rubbermaid lids staring at us from the <br/>
woods, and familiar trail-stamps before us that had not rehid the box <br/>
well.. who knows what the circumstances were, we just knew to hide it <br/>
better, make sure the plastic bag and container is hidden from the <br/>
trail, perhaps a bit of leaf litter.<br/>
<br/>
Also, what is up with the letterbox trails?  they almost always give <br/>
away the box location if it's been there more than a year... we <br/>
should all be a bit more careful of what plants are stomped between <br/>
the trail and the box?  sometimes they are just common ferns, but <br/>
sometimes they are some fragile plants ... hey, has anyone done the <br/>
Torrington CT DEP box?  OMG the tiny orange salamander population is <br/>
AMAZING!!  the clues say 20 mins, but it actually takes 1 and a half <br/>
hours if you are paying attention to not stepping on the billion <br/>
salamanders in the path!<br/>
<br/>
ok... off my late night extravaganza... a bit thank you to <br/>
letterboxing for a renewed appreciation of my local environment and a <br/>
continued heads up as to how fragile our woods and this new hobby is!<br/>
