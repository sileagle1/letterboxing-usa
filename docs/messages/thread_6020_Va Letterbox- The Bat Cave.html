THE "BAT CAVE"<br/>
<br/>
1.  Now that you've found the "Spiders Web" you can<br/>
continue your <br/>
search by returning to the split in the trail where your compass <br/>
bearing read 345 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
2.  From this split, take a compass bearing of 75 degrees and follow <br/>
the trail low and high.  You will pass another split in the trail.  <br/>
Down this trail is a fallen tree, but your path continues up the hill <br/>
until you reach another fork in the path.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Standing in front of a pile of cut limbs, take a compass bearing <br/>
of 55 degrees.  Continue down this path and you will notice one tree <br/>
that grows as two.  Along your path notice several trees, have been <br/>
carved with initials.<br/>
<br/>
4.  As you walk this trail there will be a giant moss covered tree on <br/>
your right to let you know your still on the right path.<br/>
<br/>
5.  When a small tree that has grown as two is discovered in the <br/>
middle of the trail, take a compass reading of 195 degrees and you <br/>
will see a fallen tree.  Behind this tree is the "Bat Cave".<br/>
<br/>
6.  Stamp in and re-hide better than you found it.<br/>
<br/>
7.  Look for clues to "The Fortress of Solitude", so that you can <br/>
enjoy a Letterbox-Geocache hybrid in this series.<br/>
