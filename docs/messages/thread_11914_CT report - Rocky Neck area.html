                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had an excellent day today!!! We're exhausted though!!  Got a <br/>
late start this morning so we missed the Molly Day gathering, but we <br/>
headed out to East Lyme. Met Nancy and Ron from East Haddam on the <br/>
way to the first Winter Camping is for the Birds box and we <br/>
exchanged...their first exchange so far!  Very nice people!<br/>
<br/>
The RNSP Camping box (first one of the series) was unfortunately not <br/>
re-hidden well and looked more akin to trash thrown in the woods. We <br/>
re-covered it well but know they will be pulled this week.   We <br/>
skipped those boxes that are the same as Kids Day Gathering and <br/>
found both Green Heron and the Owl in very good condition - both <br/>
lovely stamps. <br/>
<br/>
Managed to stop Inn for a late lunch...left a bird means the winter <br/>
ones are flying away and found someone's lost luggage during the <br/>
stop. We only carried the luggage for a short while but it has found <br/>
a nice place for someone else to continue the voyage.<br/>
<br/>
We finally made it up to Resolution, as we did not get that far back <br/>
in Oct at Kids Day. I am not sure who's box Resolution is...i think <br/>
its another Drew Clan production but not sure.... anyways it needs a <br/>
new log book, there's only 2 pages left in the existing one. <br/>
<br/>
We got lost on Peep-Peep and were getting tired so we tried to go <br/>
for the Pete/Wanda celebration up on the blue trail but the state <br/>
has the hiker's parking area blocked off so we called it a day and <br/>
took Maddie swimming at a local watering hole and had dinner!<br/>
<br/>
Great day, i actually feel a little tingle of sun on my face!<br/>
