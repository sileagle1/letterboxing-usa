By Amanda from Seattle<br/>
Crystal Springs Park<br/>
SeaTac, WA (King County)<br/>
<br/>
This is a nice short uphill climb to help work off that Turkey Dinner!<br/>
To find the Park:<br/>
<br/>
Northbound on I-5<br/>
Take exit #153 and stay in the northbound exit lane;<br/>
At the signal turn right onto Southcenter Parkway;<br/>
Make another right onto Klickitat Drive. Stay in the left lane;<br/>
Continue on Klickitat Drive to 53rd Avenue South; turn left;<br/>
Turn right onto S. 159th into the park.<br/>
<br/>
Southbound on I-5<br/>
Take exit #154AB, Southcenter;<br/>
Turn right onto Southcenter Boulevard;<br/>
Take an immediate right again onto 52nd Avenue South;<br/>
Follow the road to the left (narrow) onto S. 151st Street (steep <br/>
hill);<br/>
At stop sign, turn left onto 51st Avenue South.<br/>
Continue onto 51st Avenue South until it turns into Klickitat Drive;<br/>
Turn right onto 53rd Avenue South;<br/>
Turn right onto S. 159th into the park.<br/>
<br/>
Eastbound on Highway 518/I-405<br/>
Take the Southcenter Mall &amp; Parkway exit;<br/>
Turn right on Klickitat Drive;<br/>
Turn right on 53rd Avenue South;<br/>
Turn right onto S. 159th into the park.<br/>
<br/>
Westbound on I-405<br/>
Take the Southcenter Boulevard and Mall exit;<br/>
At the stop sign, turn left onto Southcenter Boulevard;<br/>
Turn right again onto 52nd Avenue South;<br/>
Follow the road to the left (narrow) onto S. 151st Street (steep <br/>
hill);<br/>

<br/>
Park by the restrooms.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Look for the street signs S 159 St and 51 Ave S. Go to the right and<br/>
 take the paved trail up the hill past the picnic shelter, play area <br/>
and artifical "pond". You will go up some steep stairs. When you <br/>
reach a bunch of choices, stay straight (approx. 250 degrees) Look <br/>
for a Magnolia on your right and a Holly bush hiding a snag on your <br/>
left. The letterbox is at the base of the snag, hidden by some pieces <br/>
of bark. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to read the waiver of responsibilty and liability<br/>
Thanks <br/>
