&gt; Heave a sigh Wanda and Pete. Someone finally <br/>
&gt; visited your new box and saved Max from a <br/>
&gt; horribly long car trip to NJ.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to read recently that at least one of the hitchers at a box of<br/>
ours has been spared the long trip to NJ.  We are also pleased to see<br/>
that 1, 2, and even 3 hitchers have been found at various of our boxes<br/>
by several different folks including Laurette &amp; David, Vic &amp; Val,<br/>
Josef from E Hartford, Dan &amp; Melissa, Carrie &amp; Nate, Mary &amp; Betz,<br/>
Martian Maggot, Stephani, Jay Drew, YIMS &amp; Lonemasswolf!<br/>
<br/>
However, there are still half a dozen hitchers left out there and at<br/>
least one that will be taking that long drive down to NJ next month,<br/>
so, hmm... wonder which one it's going to be???<br/>
