                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, everyone... I hope you're all having a great new year! I know <br/>
many of you are anxious to hear more about the huge bash we're <br/>
throwing in Oregon on the weekend of September 12th to celebrate the <br/>
tenth anniversary of American letterboxing. You'll be happy to learn <br/>
that the planning committee has been diligently making arrangements <br/>
and crunching numbers, and we're nearly ready to begin the <br/>
registration process. <br/>
<br/>
The first thing we need to make clear is that there is a limit to how <br/>
many people are going to be able to attend this event. We've reserved <br/>
one of the largest summer camp facilities in the Portland area, but <br/>
there are still only 245 beds available and the camp has strict <br/>
policies about how many extra daytime visitors can attend. <br/>
<br/>
We will open up registration at www.weliveandbreathe.com on February <br/>
16th, 2008, at 12:00 noon, Pacific Time. We will be accepting <br/>
reservations on a first-come-first-served basis, and registrations <br/>
will not be considered final until payment has been processed. Once <br/>
we have accepted reservations for 245 overnight attendees and 100 day-<br/>
trippers per day, we will close registration and announce that the <br/>
event is sold out. If, due to cancellations or other circumstances, <br/>
additional spots open up, we may make further announcements and open <br/>
up registration again for a limited time. <br/>
<br/>
The numbers are all in, and we finally have a confirmed price for <br/>
admission. The basic cost per person will be $142. This will include <br/>
your cabin bunk for two nights, meals for all three days of the event <br/>
(including the welcome barbeque on Friday night) and admission to all <br/>
camp activities (including the Letterboxer's Masquerade Ball on <br/>
Saturday night). Other pricing options will be made available, <br/>
including a limited number of deluxe accommodation packages, and <br/>
special rates for day-trippers who wish to participate in all the <br/>
day's meals and activities but will not be spending the night. <br/>
<br/>
For more information about the camp and the activities we have <br/>
planned for this event, visit our official event website at <br/>
www.weliveandbreathe.com <br/>

We can hardly wait until the 16th to register.  Then it will feel as <br/>
if this promises-to-be-super event really will occur!  We want to get <br/>
our names down, reserve our spaces, and pay our fees.  Can't anyone <br/>

You betcha!  By the time the Oregon event comes around, we will have <br/>
sailed to Bermuda and Back with you and Sue, and a number of other <br/>
letterbox fanatics.  In Oregon we expect to meet a lot of other "old <br/>
friends" from LBNA and AQ for the first time.  <br/>
<br/>
Now where else can we go?<br/>

Not to knock Kernville, but San Fran is worth the trip letterbox or no <br/>
letterbox, although the letterboxes there are fantastic.<br/>
