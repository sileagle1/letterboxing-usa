i should have followed the wait-3-days suggestions on some of my <br/>
posts, as with further thought and the insight of a few of you, i <br/>
feel as though i might have been talking out of a different part of <br/>
my anatomy. but i was not intentionally being nasty to anyone!<br/>
<br/>
ONLY CLEAN STAMPS WITH WATER, AND DO NOT WIPE THEM, BLOT THEM UNTIL <br/>
REASONABLY CLEAN! just incase you missed the posts about wipes and <br/>
comercial cleaners, they may deteriorate unorthodox materials used <br/>
for making stamps and draw animals to the hiding spot by the <br/>
scent.wiping will tear carved erasers to bits.<br/>
<br/>
when i said "encouraging other boxers" in reference to first <br/>
certificates, i MEANT people who have not yet gone boxing, not those <br/>
who are already on the chase. the people who are already involved in <br/>
this hobby will show up sooner of later, sooner with a reward, i <br/>
guess, i think the certificate is a great idea. this didnt <br/>
particularly generate backlash, but was bothering me, and i wanted to <br/>
clarify.<br/>
<br/>
site specific stamps, i dunno what happened that night. i have not <br/>
found anything i was not completely happy with. when i started i was <br/>
expecting to find, say, portraits of the presidents at mount <br/>
rushmore, but you guys have been much more creative by bringing the <br/>
environment into the theme as well. it creates much more flexibility <br/>
in the themes of the boxes and gives us more places to plant them, in <br/>
beautiful  areas that dont have one distinguishing feature, unlike <br/>
mount rushmore. i apologize for any adgitation, anxiety or dismay <br/>
that may have caused.<br/>
<br/>
as far as log-on name, email address or whatever, if i signed on as <br/>
king henry VIII and signed it ertha kit, no-one would give it a <br/>
moments notice. i should have just used common sense on that one and <br/>
not responded at all. i dont think i was nasty in my post, but none <br/>
the less, incase it was intrepeted that way, i would like to <br/>
apologize.<br/>
<br/>
i think that's it, and with that done, i would like to move on to a <br/>
well-worded non-confrontational post.<br/>
<br/>
trying not to disrupt anyones fun,<br/>
