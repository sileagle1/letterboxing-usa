                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got back from my sister's wedding in Philadelphia.  There <br/>
wasn't much time for boxing, but we managed to get in a few.  On the <br/>
way down to Philly, we picked up the DEP box in Paugussett State <br/>
Forest as well as Letterboxer 2002's Bueto Jamaicensis box.  The <br/>
latter was our 300th find!!  While in Philly, we picked up Monestary <br/>
and Body Parts, but ran short on time for the rest.  All boxes were <br/>
in good shape except Bueto Jamaicensis.  The lid was cracked badly on <br/>
that box.  Thank you to all who replied about the Philly boxes.  We <br/>
had a great time!<br/>
