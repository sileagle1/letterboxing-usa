Moose Hill, but can make the following report:<br/>
<br/>
We found Sister Road, Sister Town Letterbox in MA in late January. <br/>
Also found Queen of a River, the Little Bonus Basket, and the 3<br/>
Pasquiset Pond boxes in RI in January.  We also found The Great Blue<br/>
Letterbox, the Sakonnet Pt letterbox and two of the Rhode Island<br/>
Compass Mystery letterboxes in February.  <br/>
<br/>
Last weekend encouraged by warm weather, we found the following boxes<br/>
in MA:  The Tree for all Seasons (to pick up the "Winter" stamp before<br/>
it is retired) and the Noanet Woodlands box (which was buried in snow<br/>
and ice).  Unfortunately, ice at the summit prevented us from<br/>
uncovering the 3rd Noanet letterbox --- will return after snowmelt!<br/>
<br/>
Then on Sunday in glorious weather, we set out to plant some new<br/>
letterboxes in Massachusetts.  The clues for these boxes will be<br/>
forthcoming soon!<br/>
