Please be sure you let us know when you'll be in Sacto as I'm sure we'll be able to get a handfull of terrific 'boxers to meet and exchange with you! Also, print out clues for boxes in Davis, Ca as it's only about 20 minutes from Sac and there are several there. (Most are ours. . .)<br/>

Getting in around 12:30.  We will be in and around Sacto for a week, <br/>
then leave on Aug. 2nd.  Talked to my hubby about letterboxing on our <br/>
trip and he thinks it is a great idea. (He is not yet a letterboxer, <br/>
but this may turn him!)  I'm getting ready to carve up a special stamp <br/>
for the trip, but will have my siggy stamp on hand.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm getting super excited about coming out there!  Let me know from <br/>
here how we'll meet to exchange stamps.<br/>
