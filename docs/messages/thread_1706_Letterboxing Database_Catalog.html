As I mentioned a week or so ago, I have put together a discussion list for anyone interested in contributing ideas to a letterboxing database/catalog that I am working on creating. It will not be on the LBNA server, but rather on my site (letterboxing.com) when it is ready to be used. Right now I have taken the site offline while I work on this project. It will be back as soon as I have something ready for testing. Anyone interested in participating in the discussion of the development of this letterbox database is welcome to join the list and participate. You do NOT have to be technically inclined, just interested in contributing your opinions concerning what you would like to see in such a catalog. All you have to do is send an email message to:<br/>
