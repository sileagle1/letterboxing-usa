      Adorphus and I were pleasantly surprised to find our first LB <br/>
by chance on one of our favorite treks. We were even more surprised <br/>
to find that they seem to be at all our favorite jaunts. We completed <br/>
our first set of LB's and found our first hitch hiker(Turkey trot) in <br/>
the Robin's nest. He stayed with us over Christmas, but was eager to <br/>
move on to a place of union at the big low. We took Simba to meet him <br/>
and he was not who turkey was looking for so, Simba left him at the <br/>
place of Union. The goddess was with Simba and had to pee, so they <br/>
stopped at the outhouse on the way and soon left the hitch hiker off <br/>
to await his next ride.<br/>
      What can you say about Painterly? Adorphus and I believe we <br/>
have seen her at Heron Cove in Nov. before we Knew the secrets of the <br/>
woods. While walking one day there with the Red Damsel and the <br/>
Griffin we saw a woman who looked as if she were sketching. She was <br/>
dressed in a long skirt and wore an interesting hat.The other day we <br/>
found the LB's at the cove and realized that we had seen Painterly at <br/>
the same place as the 2nd letterbox. Painterly, if you read this. It <br/>
was a pleasure to meet you in such a fashion.<br/>
