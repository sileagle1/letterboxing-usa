it was VERY wet!  Basically swimming in water.  We dried it out, best <br/>
as we could.  Pages in journal were still readable, but very damp.  <br/>
We logged in and put the whole container and contents back in <br/>
a "drier spot".  There is a large fallen limb, which touches the tree <br/>
at which the base it was initially hidden (currently in water).  This <br/>
limb has a hollowed out knot, in which the box now resides.<br/>
<br/>
We also found the DEP Massacoe State Forest box; as well as <br/>
the "Three Furry Friends".  A great day, warm winter weather, for <br/>
boxing!<br/>
