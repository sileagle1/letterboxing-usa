&gt; Innocent mistake,<br/>
&gt; which, like many others, is quickly jumped upon.<br/>

Yes, it's sadly true that we've become quite touchy on this list.   I just <br/>
want to say publicly (as I'd already done in a private e-mail to MiniBullyMom) <br/>
that the person who'd sent the message correcting the attribution of the <br/>
placer--Paisley Orca--is one of the most friendly LBers it has been my pleasure to <br/>
meet.   I think that maybe the Rayvenhaus clan has also had the chance to meet <br/>
Paisley, and am sure Steve would agree that Paisley is not the type to get <br/>
riled up about such things.   In fact, I'd suggest she's one of the most <br/>
laid-back and easygoing LBers in our corner of the country.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to offer a public welcome to MiniBullyMom and MomZeroTime to this <br/>
list, and also an invitation to join us on the smaller, local PNW list-serve. <br/>
  I don't recall seeing their names pop up there yet--it's all PNW boxes all <br/>
the time (and any local lurkers reading this are also welcome).   The address <br/>
is groups.yahoo.com/group/LbPNW   <br/>
Hope to see you there!<br/>
