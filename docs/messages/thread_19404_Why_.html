close together that you can not do one with out the other.  I did not <br/>

letterboxing. When I joined the group there was a flame war going on <br/>
about something ridiculous.  It makes me wonder why people get so <br/>
upset about something that is supposed to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  don't let a couple of people who get offended at the the tip <br/>
of a letterbox keep anyone from enjoying a great hobby.  Anyone can <br/>
enjoy letterboxing without being a part of this group.  It is <br/>
possible. And less stressful for some people.<br/>
