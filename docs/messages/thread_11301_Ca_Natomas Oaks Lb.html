That said, we waited a month or so before we couldn't stand it any more and grabbed the Natomas Oaks microbox in Sacramento yesterday. What a beautiful site, an emerald oasis. Clues were wonderful and as an added bonus, 3 riverfront "bar and grills" less than a block away. "Woody's", the one we walked into, had 1/2 price Happy Hour appetizers we were in time for!! Can't beat that with a stick!!<br/>

When I checked in on this box (which I do often, being as it's right <br/>
across the street from our apartment), I was so thrilled to see that <br/>
someone had visited! Our first find for our first [successful] <br/>
plant. Glad you enjoyed it!<br/>
