<br/>
This is a letterboxing board. Letterboxing is separate from <br/>
geocaching. Let us hope it will always be so. Letterboxers are <br/>
different from geocachers. Let us each go our own separate ways. <br/>
Posting a defense of geocachers here does not convince anyone. <br/>
Posting a slam on geocachers here is just "preaching to the choir" as <br/>
we say at Baylor. Those who take our stamps out of our boxes are on <br/>
the same par as those who forget to hide our boxes well afterward. <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxes fulfill the Japanese ideal of beauty: cherry blossoms. <br/>
These are ephemera, flickering of blossoms as they fall. Take and <br/>
leave what impressions you may.<br/>

No, actually, no one discusses cheeseracing in great detail.  I believe that<br/>
if you go (As I did) and search on 'Cheeseracing' you'll find 38 messages in<br/>
the archive and if you search on Geocaching, you'll find more than you can<br/>
count, (I gave up at 200+).<br/>
<br/>
Now, in my not so humble opinion, cheeseracing is a topic that is<br/>
lighthearted and frivolous, and can be done at a letterboxing event whereas,<br/>
again, in my not so humble opinion, geocaching is neither lighthearted not<br/>
frivolous.<br/>
<br/>
The conversations about cheeseracing are not detrimental to the<br/>
conversations here, however, conversations, as Sir Balthazar pointed out,<br/>
are a waste of bandwidth on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the made things clearer for you.<br/>
