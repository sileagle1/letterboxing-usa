We were definately in the right area so we might go back this week and try again. We both both impressed with how quickly the city got cleaned up and enjoyed walking around and checking stuff out. Several roads were still blocked off and we were there early so there was very little traffic anywhere. We were filmed by an Action News camera man sitting on a banch not too far from the Live 8 concert stage so I'll have to see if I see us on the news. Anyway, it was still a great morning to walk around and check stuff out, sunny and cool. Hopefully the next boxers who try are more successful than we were! Oh, and Cyclonic left a box behind and will post clues soon.<br/>
