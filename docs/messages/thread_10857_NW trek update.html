Here's an update on letterboxes we've found along the way (for folks <br/>
who care about the maintenance aspect of the letterboxes):<br/>
<br/>
* Paisley Orca's Lower MacLeay Park series, Portland (All 4 boxes are <br/>
in great shape).<br/>
* Barry's MacLeay Park LB (in great shape)<br/>
* West Linn Mystery (awesome stamp and great location)<br/>
* Farewell Daylight HH along the way<br/>
* Graves Creek #3 Covered Bridge LB (excellent shape), Sunny Valley, <br/>
OR<br/>
* Burnt Turkey LB (great shape, gorgeous area!!!), Hellgate Canyon, OR<br/>
* Wild Eyed Things...  OR (great shape, many visitors)<br/>
* Applegate Rest Area LB (aka Ryan's sadistic LB)--nabbed it without <br/>
any poison oak this time!!!<br/>
* Funhog's Hog Lake Plateau LB, Red Bluff, CA (I totally loved this <br/>
area--what a beautiful and unique location--it was nice just to sit <br/>
and reflect at this area, I'd driven by it millions of times without <br/>
ever thinking of stopping!  Glad Funhog gave me a reason to slow <br/>
down!!!)  Again, missed Amanda of Seattle by a week.<br/>
* Funhog's Burney Falls LB, Burney, CA (Can't believe we were only <br/>
the second group to visit this letterbox as it has been on the block <br/>
since April or August of 2001!!!)  This LB is in one of my favorite <br/>
spots to go hiking as a kid way back in the 1970s when we lived in <br/>
Marin County!!!  There's another really cool place to visit not too <br/>
far away (Hat Creek and a neat 0.6 mile cave you can explore, too!).  <br/>
Unfortunately, we didn't have a whole lot of time on this trip.  <br/>
Maybe next time...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the letterboxing trails...<br/>
