<br/>
Is it rain or shine?<br/>
<br/>
What are the area boxes we should bring clues for?  That would be a <br/>
reasonable day- we're good for 8+- miles on our feet.<br/>
<br/>
We've never actually made it all the way into Mansfield (did some <br/>
around Coventry &amp; Tolland).  I have some older clues printed already, <br/>
but haven't printed any clues at all since the new site went up -- <br/>
clues are still unavailable in Netscape. That means I have to spend <br/>
some time copy/pasting into MSWord, then removing all the hard <br/>
returns--you can imagine how that excites me.<br/>

<br/>
The Alphabet Bandits too are considering coming.  We are actually thinking about doing both the CT (21st) and the PA (28th) events.  They are equidistant from home (2 1/2 hours)   We will be leaving for Camp shortly thereafter, and probably won't get any boxing ops until Mid August.<br/>
<br/>
We too would appreciate knowing exactly which boxes are do-able, and approx how many are appropriate for 7 kids ranging from 3 - 7.  Don't let the 3 year old fool you... she's more of a trooper than the 10 and 11 year olds... the older ones have more whine than Ernest and Julio Gallo!<br/>
<br/>
Same goes for PA.  We'd really be greatfulf or the help.<br/>
<br/>

PS .. we finally saw a stamp today we recognized... Howdy Rubaduck!<br/>
