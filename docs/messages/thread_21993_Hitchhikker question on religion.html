<br/>
.....my .02 regarding the religious HH....I think that<br/>
it's perfectly fine to plant your own religious themed<br/>
letterbox that you plan to maintain, care for, etc.<br/>
It's your box, you can do what you like. However, when<br/>
I find religious themed calling cards in my box, that<br/>
"I" plant and maintain...then it's not okay. Totally<br/>
overstepping a boundary. I don't appreciate my box<br/>
being used as a "soapbox" by anyone but myself! When<br/>
the calling cards appear in my boxes and boxes I<br/>
maintain...they go straight to the trash....I don't<br/>
care if I agree or not. It's my box. Unless it's a HH,<br/>
don't put it in my box. If it's a religious themed HH,<br/>
move it along quick......or I will certainly send it<br/>
to someone near a religious themed series where like<br/>
minded people can share it. <br/>
