<br/>
    First off, I want to thank everyone who has responded thus far to the BOTUS (Birds Of The Union Stamps) request.... After looking at everything and listening to what everyone has had to say here recently, even though I have a different images from most of the states, there are a few that have the same images.  In the interest of carving unique stamps, I think we are going to change tracks here and combine this with a project my son is doing for school.  He has to research all 50 states, and gathering information on each state.  So, based on that and the problems with the same birds, we're going to take his research and turn that into stamps. IN other words, we're going to take a United States map and carve the state outline, the same size across all that will result in a completed map, if all are found, place his research with each stamp and send those out.  So, to match this up, we're changing the name to "Steffan's USA Series" and to fulfill the Old Military requirement in me, the Acronym will be SUSAS (Pronounced Sue Sass) (Seems military training runs deep...... really deep! LOL!!!)<br/>
<br/>
The new URL for joining is http://www.myndworx.com/susas<br/>
<br/>
and the Interactive Map is located at http://www.myndworx.com/modules.php?name=SUSAS<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all of your help, without you this would not be possible.<br/>
