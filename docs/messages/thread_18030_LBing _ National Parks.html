                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think we need to clarify our terminology. There are several <br/>
federal land agencies with a variety of purposes.  <br/>
<br/>
National Parks are foremost to "preserve" a national treasure - <br/>
sometimes natural &amp; scenic; sometimes historic.  In National Parks <br/>
there is no hunting, no oil drilling, no timber cutting.  In this <br/>
day &amp; age when environmental issues have very low priority with our <br/>
government most parks are in a sad state.  Visitor numbers continue <br/>
to rise but with budget cuts there is less money for maintenance to <br/>
stay nothing of upgrading facilities or even maintaining adequate <br/>
staff.<br/>
<br/>
National Forests run by an entirely different agency, the US Forest <br/>
Service in the Department of Agriculture, are managed for multiple <br/>
use.  Such uses include extractive activities such as mining &amp; <br/>
logging, hunting, trapping as well as recreational activities such <br/>
as camping, hiking, wildlife watching, skiing, snowmobiling and so <br/>
forth.  In general Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands are managed <br/>
similar to national forests for multiple use.  There is also a whole <br/>
other class of federal property - National Wildlife Refuges.  They <br/>
often have restrictions to protect the wildlife they are managing <br/>
but also encourage visitors &amp; I plan to place some boxes at several <br/>
refuges in my area this summer.<br/>
<br/>
As with cemetaries it would be possible to encourage people to visit <br/>
national parks to get information that they need to solve the clues <br/>
&amp; then hide the box itself in another nearby location.  I know that <br/>
they are in fact geocaches in national parks but they are "virtual" <br/>
caches where the person has to obtain information from a sign &amp; <br/>
relay it to the cache placer to get credit for the find.  There is <br/>
no actual box at the location.<br/>
<br/>
Okay I'll get off my soap box now &amp; go back to carving a stamp for <br/>
my wildlife refuge box.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are quite right Quarks mom; point taken. I can't think of any <br/>
National Parks that allow "extractive" activity. However I have gone <br/>
hiking, biking, camping, and rock climbing in National Parks where <br/>
these activities are permitted. In fact I live near the C&amp;O Canal <br/>
National Park and use it often. Their own web site lists the <br/>
following as activities you can enjoy there:<br/>
<br/>
Backpacking Biking Bird Watching Boating Camping Climbing Cross <br/>
Country Skiing Fishing Hiking Horseback Riding Interpretive Programs <br/>
Kayaking Nature Walks Wildlife Viewing.<br/>
<br/>
Facilities have been built to accommodate many of these activities <br/>
such as campsites with toilets, water supply, and electrical <br/>
hookups, boat ramps, stables, and bridges. How do any of these <br/>
present any less environmental impact than a Tupperware box. The <br/>
National Parks are still prohibiting an activity that has very <br/>
little environmental impact in comparison to other activities that <br/>
they actively promote through the expenditure of their meager funds <br/>
to build permanent facilities that permanently alter the <br/>
environment. The very construction of these facilities encourages <br/>
greater and greater usage and environmental harm. Planting non-<br/>
native grass and subsequent mowing and fertilizing an area for <br/>
camping, picnicking and ball playing not to mention septic fields <br/>
and sewage treatment facilities harm native vegetation in ways no <br/>
misplaced foot or Tupperware box ever could. Fishing KILLS wildlife. <br/>
Merely catching fish was shown in a recent study reported on NPR to <br/>
be painful to fish and therefore a stressor and handling fish in the <br/>
catch and release process is a well-understood stressor and exposes <br/>
the fish to wounds and infection but my Tupperware box is a threat <br/>
to wildlife. And now I'm to believe we as letterboxers have pushed <br/>
the limit too far? I'm supposed to accept that and tell myself "Oh <br/>
well, that's the rules"? No, the injustice of this ruling needs to <br/>
be pointed out to the National Park Service. I'm not proposing <br/>
putting a letterbox in Lincoln's hand in the Lincoln Memorial but I <br/>
do think we have unfairly been excluded from National Parks. No, I <br/>
don't believe that they did it to p*ss me off, I believe they did it <br/>
without any consideration what so ever of the facts and with <br/>
complete dismissal and, as I already said, apathetic disregard.<br/>
