<br/>
I, Investigator Francis Bacon, have returned from places unknown. After working with first that sot who calls himself Der Mad Stamper, and then that fussy old biddy Emily Post, I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  Let me tell you, Der Mad Stamper is mad, as mad as a hatter. Emily Post, don't even go there. No pleasing Mrs. Manners. But, let me get to the point. <br/>
<br/>
What better way to recover sanity than to indulge in insanity? So on Tuesday June 12, 2007, I boarded Aloha Airlines, heading for the obligation of my niece's wedding. Which of course was just a stepping-stone to the real reason for my visit: Letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
My time limited, due to family obligations, I was not able to explore the island. However I did manage a hike on the Captain Cook's Monument Trail. Captain Cook was killed as a result of a miscommunication. Something to remember. But, I did not come here to talk about work, insanity or Captain Cook; I came here to talk letterboxing. I left to escape insanity; I came back to divulge information, boxes found and boxes planted. <br/>
<br/>
There are less than a hundred letterboxes in Hawaii and only 2 listed mysteries. If you travel there, take some time out to plant. The islands are sadly lacking. What is there is mostly hand carved stamps, well-hidden, nice locations. Letterboxing in Hawaii is an exercise in stealth. The tourists are over-running the joint. Those of you planting in the Islands better be investing in water-tight containers. The cheap stuff isn't going to cut the mustard. Planting in Waikiki will be a challenge as the homeless have a good handle on the better hiding spots. Then again, enough Mai Tais and any spot will look good. Disappointing though to see that not much in the way of mystery boxes are being planted. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My Fellow Letterboxers,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I, Investigator Francis Bacon, have returned from places unknown. After<br/>
&gt; working with first that sot who calls himself Der Mad Stamper, and then that<br/>
&gt; fussy old biddy Emily Post, I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Let<br/>
&gt; me tell you, Der Mad Stamper is mad, as mad as a hatter. Emily Post, don't<br/>
&gt; even go there. No pleasing Mrs. Manners. But, let me get to the point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What better way to recover sanity than to indulge in insanity? So on<br/>
&gt; Tuesday June 12, 2007, I boarded Aloha Airlines, heading for the obligation<br/>
&gt; of my niece's wedding. Which of course was just a stepping-stone to the real<br/>
&gt; reason for my visit: Letterboxing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My time limited, due to family obligations, I was not able to explore the<br/>
&gt; island. However I did manage a hike on the Captain Cook's Monument Trail.<br/>
&gt; Captain Cook was killed as a result of a miscommunication. Something to<br/>
&gt; remember. But, I did not come here to talk about work, insanity or Captain<br/>
&gt; Cook; I came here to talk letterboxing. I left to escape insanity; I came<br/>
&gt; back to divulge information, boxes found and boxes planted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are less than a hundred letterboxes in Hawaii and only 2 listed<br/>
&gt; mysteries. If you travel there, take some time out to plant. The islands are<br/>
&gt; sadly lacking. What is there is mostly hand carved stamps, well-hidden, nice<br/>
&gt; locations. Letterboxing in Hawaii is an exercise in stealth. The tourists<br/>
&gt; are over-running the joint. Those of you planting in the Islands better be<br/>
&gt; investing in water-tight containers. The cheap stuff isn't going to cut the<br/>
&gt; mustard. Planting in Waikiki will be a challenge as the homeless have a good<br/>
&gt; handle on the better hiding spots. Then again, enough Mai Tais and any spot<br/>
&gt; will look good. Disappointing though to see that not much in the way of<br/>
&gt; mystery boxes are being planted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>

Rick, if I had a unlisted box hidden somewhere, I would totally tell you<br/>
where it is once you received the psychic signal from me that I had one and<br/>
you should ask in the first place.<br/>

Sorry, remind me the point of having a mystery box?<br/>

Or a personal traveler?<br/>

Or of letterboxing in general?<br/>

Why not?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My Fellow Letterboxers,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I, Investigator Francis Bacon, have returned from places unknown. After<br/>
&gt; working with first that sot who calls himself Der Mad Stamper, and then that<br/>
&gt; fussy old biddy Emily Post, I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Let<br/>
&gt; me tell you, Der Mad Stamper is mad, as mad as a hatter. Emily Post, don't<br/>
&gt; even go there. No pleasing Mrs. Manners. But, let me get to the point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What better way to recover sanity than to indulge in insanity? So on<br/>
&gt; Tuesday June 12, 2007, I boarded Aloha Airlines, heading for the obligation<br/>
&gt; of my niece's wedding. Which of course was just a stepping-stone to the real<br/>
&gt; reason for my visit: Letterboxing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My time limited, due to family obligations, I was not able to explore the<br/>
&gt; island. However I did manage a hike on the Captain Cook's Monument Trail.<br/>
&gt; Captain Cook was killed as a result of a miscommunication. Something to<br/>
&gt; remember. But, I did not come here to talk about work, insanity or Captain<br/>
&gt; Cook; I came here to talk letterboxing. I left to escape insanity; I came<br/>
&gt; back to divulge information, boxes found and boxes planted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are less than a hundred letterboxes in Hawaii and only 2 listed<br/>
&gt; mysteries. If you travel there, take some time out to plant. The islands are<br/>
&gt; sadly lacking. What is there is mostly hand carved stamps, well-hidden, nice<br/>
&gt; locations. Letterboxing in Hawaii is an exercise in stealth. The tourists<br/>
&gt; are over-running the joint. Those of you planting in the Islands better be<br/>
&gt; investing in water-tight containers. The cheap stuff isn't going to cut the<br/>
&gt; mustard. Planting in Waikiki will be a challenge as the homeless have a good<br/>
&gt; handle on the better hiding spots. Then again, enough Mai Tais and any spot<br/>
&gt; will look good. Disappointing though to see that not much in the way of<br/>
&gt; mystery boxes are being planted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>
&gt;<br/>
