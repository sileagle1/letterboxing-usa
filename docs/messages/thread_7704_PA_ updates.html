We got the mountain bikes out today and went letterboxing. Heres<br/>
what we found and didn't find:<br/>
<br/>
"FCF", in good shape. Bike friendly location.<br/>
<br/>
"Homage", in good shape, bike friendly location. We were the <br/>
first to stamp in. Thanks, the clues were really clever!<br/>
<br/>
"Stream vs road", we had no luck. The clues were too vague for<br/>
us. We were stumped on Head west a few. Head west a few what? <br/>
Lots of saplings and V shaped trees in the woods as well. I<br/>
guess we were in the wrong place?<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to go to Hawk Mountain, but didn't have the time. I<br/>
was wondering if somebody could tell me if they allow bikes<br/>
there?<br/>

Do you mean this box:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/shredmtb/homage.html<br/>
<br/>
If so, it is a mystery box and no one but Shred should give you a hint, <br/>
as it is not their place to do so.<br/>

I'm fairly confident that Geogirl has retired from the hobby.<br/>
Perhaps pursing other avenues will be beneficial.<br/>
