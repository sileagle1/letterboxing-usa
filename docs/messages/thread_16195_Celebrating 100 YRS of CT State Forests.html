Thank you to all the carvers and placers that got involved with this <br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>

meeting Aili and Bruce, and Asetki, Tehutika &amp; Kids!!!  I missed you <br/>
again Sunshine!!! Ah well, the next meeting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Pine Tree and Butterfly for joining me.  It is a pleasure to <br/>

park/forest system in CT.  Dreaming of the day that we can share a <br/>
similar relationship with our area state parks.  The paths have been <br/>
paved for a few locations in our neck of the woods, but hopefully, <br/>
one day, we will be welcome in many, many more locales.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for setting such a wonderful example in CT!!!  Glad you <br/>
enjoyed your gettogether.  Congratulations on the big anniversary, <br/>
too!<br/>

<br/>
We finally made it to a gathering! Go us!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of the boxers that came out to play in<br/>
CT today instead of trekking all the way out to the<br/>
Cape. It's nice to finally have faces to put to the<br/>
stamps we've been looking at for the last year and a<br/>
half.<br/>
<br/>
The event stamp was great, the exchanges plentiful,<br/>
and the new boxes prolific. Managed to exchange one HH<br/>
for another one (yet another reason to come out to<br/>
Strathmore Park in Russel MA to see us tomorrow!), and<br/>
hit the trail with the Engraver and Kstar (who is<br/>
likely to be the first boxer to complete our Zodiac<br/>
series), and, as a special surprise, the Letterboxing<br/>
Purple Heart made an appearance, and was awarded to<br/>
two deserving attendees (my bad on this one. I thought<br/>
my wife mailed it out, she though I had, until I found<br/>
it in my desk!). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Music Woman for planting new boxes for us to<br/>
find, and all of the folks that carved the stamps for<br/>
her to place. Of course, thanks to the CT DEP for<br/>
placing 30 boxes for us to find, as well as the<br/>
special one-day centennial stamp. Special thanks to<br/>
Don Smith, the nice man with the DEP that actually<br/>
carved all of those stamps for us. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, as this was a common question during the day,<br/>
according to the DEP, you do not have to complete all<br/>
30 boxes this year in order to get the walking stick.<br/>
As long as you eventually finish them all, you can get<br/>
the prize.<br/>
<br/>
With all of the exchanges, new finds, personal<br/>
travellers and whatnot, I've got no idea what our PFX<br/>
is now, except it's got to be getting close to 300.<br/>
Thanks again to all for getting us closer to that<br/>
goal. Looking forward to doing this again sometime...<br/>
<br/>
Mike S.<br/>
