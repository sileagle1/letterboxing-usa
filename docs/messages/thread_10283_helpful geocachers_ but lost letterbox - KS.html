geocacher who we thought had left a cache where our letterbox used to<br/>
be; s/he was very helpful but did not know what we were talking about.<br/>
When we figured out that there was another cache at the same site we<br/>
contacted that person, who was also very helpful. But again no cigar. <br/>
<br/>
The gist of it is, the hiders of the geocaches did not move the Konza<br/>
letterbox. I rather suspect one of the finders did, and we'll never<br/>
find it. Too bad - it was just the second stamp we'd ever tried to make.<br/>
<br/>
So for now, the only letterbox in NE Kansas is now missing.<br/>
<br/>
But, on the positive side, we've just discovered that there are 248<br/>
geocaches in this area!!! <br/>
