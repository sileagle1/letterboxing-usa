                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everybody.  Yesterday I took advantage of the unexpectedly sunny <br/>
weather and checked on my two boxes at Wendell State Forest in Wendell, <br/>
Massachusetts.  The score?  Letterboxes - 2, Winter - 0.  Both boxes are <br/>
in good shape.  One was completely dry, the other had a little water in <br/>
it, because the lid was cracked.  (Actually, it was cracked before <br/>
winter--that happened the day I hid the box.) However, the log books, <br/>
postcards, and stamps are completely dry, since they are inside Ziplock <br/>
bags.<br/>
<br/>
I was excited to see that there are three stamps in the Letterbox El <br/>
Corazon box (the easiest to find).  And one alert couple have found the <br/>
second box, Letterbox Vincent.  It's so wonderful to see their stamps <br/>
and read the notes they wrote.  There are some nice images and colors. <br/>
Come find the boxes and check them out!<br/>
<br/>
I am going to hide one more box in Wendell State Forest, since I have to <br/>
go back and replace the cracked lid anyway.  But I think I'm not going <br/>
to publish that clue on the Web.  The only way to get it will be by <br/>
finding one of the other two boxes.  So it'll be a bonus box.  My next <br/>
box after that will be dedicated to the poet Emily Dickinson, hidden <br/>
somewhere in Amherst, of course.  And then, who knows?  To <br/>
infinity...and beyond! (Hmm, maybe there's a Buzz Lightyear box in my <br/>
future as well...)<br/>
<br/>
So, Tom, that's the status of my Mass. boxes.  Have you heard from other <br/>
New Englanders about their boxes?<br/>
<br/>
I decided to re-write the Letterbox Vincent clue to give just a little <br/>
more information.  Dan, could you paste this in the the Web page and <br/>
delete the old clue?  Thanks so much.  Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
Revised Clue for Letterbox Vincent, Wendell State Forest, Wendell, Mass.<br/>
<br/>
Park in the main parking lot across from Ruggles Pond.  At the far end <br/>
of the lot you'll see white blazes on trees, which mark the Metacomet <br/>
Monadnock trail.  Follow the white blazes, hiking downhill. Eventually <br/>
you'll come to a fallen birch that you'll need to climb over or crawl <br/>
under.  Shortly thereafter the trail runs quite close to a steep ravine, <br/>
with a stream and waterfall on your left. Soon you'll come to a spot <br/>
where the stream on your left and a waterfall on your right converge. <br/>
You'll need to cross the stream; then the trail veers to the right, a <br/>
short but steep uphill climb.  Continue on the trail, following the <br/>
white blazes, as it winds through the woods. You'll pass a large rock <br/>
(14" or so high) jutting out from the trail, which looks like a porpoise <br/>
head or perhaps a giant frog's head.  For some time the trail runs <br/>
parallel to a stream on your left.  Keep going.  When the trail veers to <br/>
the right, away from the stream, be alert.  You're almost there. You'll <br/>
pass a large birch tree on your right, then you'll come to a large <br/>
fallen tree on the left, which points to a small clearing.  Turn left, <br/>
leave the trail, and step into the center of the clearing.  Look for a <br/>
small shelter made of a birch log and birch bark.  If you come to <br/>
Jerusalem Road, where there's a wooden sign saying "M &amp; M Trail," you've <br/>
gone too far.  But turn back, you're actually very close to the box.          <br/>
