<div>Just got back from a short trip to Stockbridge, Ma. 
with "You Inspire My Spirit".</div>
<div>While we were out there we located the following 
boxes. All are in great shape.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Norman Rockwell Museum. </div>
<div><em>The trail starting at the lightpole in the 
southwest corner of the parking lot is a little overgrown, but once you spot the 
road and find pole 18, everything comes together.</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Monument Mountain</div>
<div><em>By all means climb to the top of the mountain 
after you find the box, the views are fantastic and the trails are wonderful. 
Come down on the red trail and you will find a super waterfall with a cave 
beneath.</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div>Craggy Knoll</div>
<div><em>We could not spend the time we would have like 
to in this beautiful site, the mosquitoes were outrageous. This may be a great 
fall visit.</em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lion's Head</div>
<div><em>Nice climb, great views and lots and lots of 
finders who came across the box without looking for it. Nice of them to log in, 
record their comments and replace the box.</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div>Mainline</div>
<div><em>How do you find these places Jay? The climb up 
along that stream, crossing and recrossing was a highlight of the hike. You do 
tend to underestimate the degree of difficulty. Little children may have a hard 
time with this one. Pete and Wanda, this one is made for you.</em></div>
