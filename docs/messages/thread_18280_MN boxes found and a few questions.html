Excuse my duplication of what I've heard to be a recently asked question,<br/>

responses would be fine.  (Please just include "LbNA" in the topic so I<br/>
don't delete it as unrecognized mail!)<br/>

My other question involves mini (micro?) boxes using film canisters and the<br/>
like.  I already figured out the stamp pad is omitted (and that fact<br/>
mentioned in the clues), and assume the stamp is small (duh!).  What do you<br/>
use for the journal?  Just some small sheets of paper/cardstock cut to fit<br/>
and stapled together?  Again, off-list responses fine if you prefer, but as<br/>
with most of these yahoo groups, it usually seems inevitable that each wave<br/>

I'm new to letterboxing as well and share your excitement, questions and concerns.<br/>
I've decided to include my email address and not my home address when I create a letterbox (still in the planning stage).  I figure if anyone needs to contact me, they can do it via email and no need for them to have my home address.  Just my 2 cents worth.<br/>
BTW, we went to Key Biscayne, FL this past weekend for the tennis tournament and were able to slip away on Sunday morning for a beautiful 45 minute hike through Bill Baggs Cape Floruida State Park to the Cape Florida Lighthouse letterbox.  Loved it!<br/>

Well, up until a couple of weeks ago, you could have gone after my box in the <br/>
same park, but it vanished.   Oh well.   I agree, Seamaiden's lighthouse box <br/>
is great!<br/>

I too would only leave an e-mail address.   But others leave postcards in their boxes asking them to send them out if there is an issue with the box.  Maybe they only put a PO Box, maybe more.  If you use a phone number, your home address is pretty easy to find out if it is a "listed" address, in the phone book.  <br/>
<br/>
The micro boxes I have found, have like 1" strips cut from an 8x11 piece of paper.  They are stapled on one end and then rolled up.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps, Fisher<br/>

Why put any address in the letterbox? The "contact placer" function <br/>
on the clue page works great! If you just put www.letterboxing.org <br/>
those interested sufficiently will contact you.<br/>
