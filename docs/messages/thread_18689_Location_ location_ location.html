I thought I'd speak my mind about something that I've thought could greatly improve and simplify these letterboxing communications!  If people could please try to remember to include the name of the STATE (county would be great too) they're speaking of whenever they mention certain boxes and landmarks--creeks, mts, parks, etc. it would be wonderful!  If we could include at least the state's abbreviation in the subject line as well, it would be even more wonderful.  This would help a person know whether it's something pertinent to them now, as well as help greatly in finding certain emails in the archives later if they are traveling &amp; looking for info.  Does most of the info. that gets reported here, esp. about missing boxes, get on the website pretty quickly or does the planter need to take care of that?  I only wondered because it would be a challenge to go back and find the emails about certain boxes in your own state, and I haven't been on here long enough to know the answer to that question.  -lunaryakketyact<br/>
