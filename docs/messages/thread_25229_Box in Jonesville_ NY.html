&gt; They're doing some construction near my parents' house near Jonesville, NY.<br/>
&gt; Can you let the group know if they have a letterbox near a playground on<br/>
&gt; Longkill Road called "Snap out of it", or something like that, they had to<br/>
&gt; move it 20 feet or so, because the trees it was under are being removed to<br/>
&gt; widen a path.<br/>
