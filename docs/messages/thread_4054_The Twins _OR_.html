deciduous trees in the direction instructed. Well, that or I picked the<br/>
wrong light pole. I may actually go out to Blue Lake on Tuesday. I like the<br/>
idea of a box someplace ive never been. So far all of the boxes in the<br/>
Portland area are in places im very familiar with. Hopefully I will see you<br/>
all there.<br/>

Don't feel too bad if you have trouble finding the second box, <br/>
because most people have failed at it.  Presumeably, if everyone who <br/>
found the first box also looked for the second box, but VERY few <br/>
people have signed into the second box.  It took two attempts on my <br/>
part to find it, and the second one almost ended in disgrace as well <br/>
with killer insects, shoelace-eating plants, and slithering reptiles <br/>
chasing after me.<br/>
<br/>
You've been warned.  ;o)<br/>

Hope you can!  However, be sure to carve a signature stamp so I can <br/>
add it to my "exchange" book.  =)  Unless you don't mind using a <br/>
thumbprint and inking up your fingers instead.  That's an acceptable <br/>
form of a signature "stamp" in my book.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Off topic story about thumbprints as a quick and dirty signature <br/>
stamp:  I suggested using a thumbprint to one of my friends in <br/>
California who doesn't have a signature stamp (yet!).  After all, <br/>
it's ALAWYS with you, so you can't ever forget it.  And it's always <br/>
original and always YOU.  It's hard to fake a thumbprint!  A <br/>
brilliant idea, I thought.  =)  But she took it one step further by <br/>
turning them into little cartoons.  One thumbprint became a rabbit.  <br/>
Another became a giraffe.  And so on.  Very cute stuff.  <br/>
That "signature stamp" is one of the best I've ever seen, and one <br/>
nobody is likely going to forget whenever they see it!  =)<br/>

Beth and I suffered through much of the same turmoil as described by <br/>
Ryan, not to mention a particular nasty area of stinging nettles.  <br/>
Just gotta love them little devils! <br/>

Don't give up on the The Twins 2nd box, as it's in there all right, <br/>
and you most likely got the correct pole landmark indeed!<br/>

I actually have already made my own stamp. Its a small black roughed out<br/>
yin-yang. I amde it small thinking that the log books wouldnt be that big<br/>
but have been suprised at the size of some other peoples stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiousity, do any of you know a place to get the rubber blanks<br/>
used for stamp making? I can remeber using them in Junior high years ago to<br/>
make stamps but havent been able to find any at Jo-Anns or Michaels.<br/>
