&gt; As one who is physically limited in the amount of walking I can do, <br/>
I appreciate your son's thoughtfulness. I have to be selective in the <br/>
boxes I can look for so I appreciate information such as difficulty <br/>
and distance within the clues. A couple tricks I have learned is to <br/>
carefully read the clues and see if the route would be shorter if <br/>
worked backwards or to use trail maps to determine if there is a <br/>
shorter route back to the car. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
This is a good point.<br/>
The general descriptions of difficulty, "Easy," etc, are so relative <br/>
as to be a little useless seometimes.<br/>
<br/>
A box that is "easy" to get to for your basic long-distance hiker or <br/>
mountain climber might be a major undertaking for a boxer with a bad <br/>
knee or a even letterboxer who is just beginning and might be used to <br/>
a more sedantary lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe as the hobby is just becoming appreciated by a wider group of <br/>
folks than were initially involved in North America, it might be nice <br/>
if more box placers labeled their clues with estimated milage, <br/>
altitude gain, and trail conditions?  <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.       -Jugglermouse<br/>
