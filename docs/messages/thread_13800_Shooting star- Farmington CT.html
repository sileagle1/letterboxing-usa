I cleaned it out.   I work right across the street from the box but had a tough time getting to it before now.  If it wasn't raining there were always people eating lunch on the benches or feeding the ducks and geese.  THanks for the box so nearby!   this was my 130th find.  I hope to get to 200 before the summer is over and I have to go back to school!!   Odilio<br/>
