<br/>
I went out with my cousin, Deb, yesterday to celebrate the first <br/>
sunny day in a week by letterboxing. (Really, what else is there to <br/>
do??)  Since we were "kid free"...we usually have her two kids, ages <br/>
4 and 7, with us)...we decided to get as many boxes as possible.  We <br/>
started at about 2:30 with an 8 box series.  With twilight came us <br/>
leading each other to boxes that we had each found alone.  At about <br/>
8:30 pm, we were at "Bald Eagle LB" in Scituate, RI.  <br/>
Twilight...cemetery...creepy!  Needless to say, we were in a hurry!  <br/>
We were delighted to find the Travelin' Mama HH in the box but <br/>
equally disappointed to find that <gasp> the stamp was missing!!!  <br/>
Since we always do one more box than we should, we were convinced <br/>
this was the one.  I left a note in the logbook about the missing <br/>
stamp and contacting both the placer and the von der Insels who were <br/>
the last finders.  Deb and I were actually horrified to think that <br/>
the von der Insels may have absconded with the stamp!!  We got in <br/>
the car and stamped ourselves into the HH.  As I rolled the stamp <br/>
for the HH out of its paper towel, out fell the Bald Eagle stamp!!!  <br/>
Needless to say, we were pretty psyched.....although it meant <br/>
another trip into a quickly darkening cemetery!<br/>
<br/>
So, I can understand how it is that Kevin came to need more room in <br/>
his house for his new-found treasures...<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Bald Eagle is back in its nest, patiently waiting for <br/>
the next finder and Travelin' Mama will be on her way soon!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>

My two cents. I was going to post this in the mounting topic, but <br/>
this works too...<br/>
<br/>
  I make hitchhikers out of 35mm film canisters. I try to make the <br/>
stamp small enough to be mounted to the inside of the canister's <br/>
cap.  This way, there is no way of misplacing it. I don't always do <br/>
this as it tends to limit the stamp size, but it makes a nice little <br/>
package when it all fits together.<br/>
