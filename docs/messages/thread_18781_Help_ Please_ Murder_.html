                    <div class="plaintext-content">Help! Please, Murder!  I need your help. I fear my college roommate <br/>
and childhood friend the famous linguist P.S. Buck has gone missing <br/>
and I fear her dead.  Just a few days ago I received a very odd note <br/>
from her that she needed to meet me at my house. <br/>
The hour of meeting has come and gone and my dear Pearl has not <br/>
arrived. <br/>
<br/>
Her instructions go on to say in the event of her unfortunate demise <br/>
I was to find the priceless treasure she had discovered. After many <br/>
long years of work she had finally broken the code to finding the <br/>
priceless Red Tiger Eye bracelet. <br/>
Her note goes on to say she has scattered the keys to finding the red <br/>
tigers eye bracelet throughout the State. I need your help in <br/>
breaking the code. There is only one so time is of the essence. <br/>
<br/>
Oh My Gosh! They have found me!! Help Please, Murder!!!<br/>
