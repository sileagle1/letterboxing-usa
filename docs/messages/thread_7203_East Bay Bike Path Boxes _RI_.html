On 8/25, we did a portion of this 14 mile trail, starting in <br/>
Providence. We located, from Series II, the Sightseer and the <br/>
Fisherman. We also found the "East Bay Bike Path" box -- this <br/>
provided a shady respite as well as a pretty wooded walk. Gor to try <br/>
out our new personal stamp too.<br/>
<br/>
The "Stroller" eluded us. Perhaps we were too hot to scrabble long <br/>
enough in the gravel? Or we may have been in the wrong spot. No <br/>
matter, the view to the island with the gazebo was reward enough!<br/>
