Through Geologic Time", great job spike and frogger!!! I'd like to alert<br/>
anyone who's traveling through CT on a trip to take an hour and hop off<br/>
I91 to score these boxes, it is worth it. We also returned to Rensalear<br/>
in Glasonbury, hoping to find the box we couldn't under 10 or so inches<br/>
of snow, and we could not find it :( If the "planter" is out there<br/>
still, please go check on your box, we really are thinking it's gone a<br/>
hiking. Or has anyone found it recently?? Happy Mother's Day, it was a<br/>
beauty.<br/>
