                    <div class="plaintext-content">It depends on what part of the State you are going and what type of activities your kids like.  Colorado is a great place for hiking, both long and short ones.  You can't go wrong visiting Rocky Mt. National Park in northeast part of state, or Mesa Verde National Park in southwest part.  You won't be able to letterbox there, but still worth a visit.  Other places I like include:  Garden Of The Gods &amp; Pikes Peak in Colorado Springs, Maroon Bells near Aspen, Mt. Evans Scenic Byway near Denver, hot springs and waterfalls in Ouray and the "Million Dollar Highway from there to Durango.  There are many more and I'm sure people that live there will have better ideas.  You can join the Rocky Mt. Group at:<br/>
