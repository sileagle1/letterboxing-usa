password is, since I have never had a need to use it.<br/>
<br/>
However,  one letterbox that we hid (and over 100 people had visited) <br/>
was under a tree that blew down in a storm.  I want to change my clues <br/>
slightly and put the box in another spot near by, but have no idea how <br/>
to go about it.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to reach some one in this group, but have gotten no0 <br/>
replies.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br/>

Thanks,   Mary Anne<br/>
