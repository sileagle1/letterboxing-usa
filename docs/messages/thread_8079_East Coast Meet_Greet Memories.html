put <br/>
forth to make such a wonderful gathering a reality.  Thanks to<br/>
everyone <br/>
for making it such a memorable event!  Bern and I had a fantastic<br/>
time <br/>
- thanks for the book making tips and supplies ADG #3!  Bern will be <br/>
able to put those new skills to good use (I'm not very creative that <br/>
way so I'll stick to the carving). :)  Although I probably should've <br/>
hung around for the carving tips from you and Healwar - I could use<br/>
the <br/>
help!  But...the trail was calling and boxes needed to be found.  <br/>
Daughter of the Old Dominion and ourselves did indeed find all 8<br/>
boxes <br/>
- including a hitchhiker (Ramblin' Rose) that Mary found in Boxitup's <br/>
Fox Box.  I think my feet hurt as much as Psychomommy's did - thank<br/>
God <br/>
Bern was driving home!  It was getting a little dark by the time we <br/>
finished, although not as bad as when we met Healwar, Cat Woman, and <br/>
Biki for the first time.  You think we would learn our lesson...but <br/>
nooooo!  We just had to get your box - I would've been very <br/>
dissapointed it we missed it!  When we finally got back to our cars,<br/>
we <br/>
were a little more than grateful for the remaining Krispy Kremes and <br/>
soda we found.  They didn't last long (with me around :) ) and we <br/>
cleaned up the remaining stuff and left the area spick and span.  I<br/>
was <br/>
very tempted to take ADG #1's offer of adult beverages, but I don't <br/>
think I could've walked that far - thanks anyway!  Next time!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone for the great time and I hope we can do it<br/>
again <br/>
soon!<br/>

P.S.  Psychomommy - I think your Here snakey, snakey perfume worked <br/>
just fine - the only problem was a car's tire found him before he<br/>
found you!<br/>
