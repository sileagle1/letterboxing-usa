                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I just did my first THREE stamps today!  I am so excited. They <br/>
turned out so nicely.  I only wish I had a scanner or something so I <br/>
could share them!<br/>
I started with a really simple design for my first one.  It turned <br/>
out SO nicely I decided to go ahead try and do my personal stamp. I <br/>
did that- it admittedly took two tries.  And then I did another for <br/>
my husband! <br/>
Thanks to Mary from VA for your tips on getting the right tools (I <br/>
used a Micheal's coupon just as you did!).  And also, if the person <br/>
who did the website Carving 101 is on this list-- thanks to you as <br/>
well! (That website was also VERY useful and helpful!) <br/>
Here is the link in case anyone else needs some tips for their first <br/>
stamp: (It seems like mostly experienced letterboxers here--but just <br/>
in case someone new runs across this)<br/>

Now I am ready to find my first box!!! <br/>
