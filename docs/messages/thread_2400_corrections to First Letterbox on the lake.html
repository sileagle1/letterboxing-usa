<br/>We visited our letterbox for the first time this spring after all the snow 
<br/>was gone.  We discovered that some of our pace counts and the visible trails 
<br/>were different without snow on the ground.  The necessary corrections have 
<br/>been made to our clues in the description that follows.  Please post this 
<br/>corrected version on the website.  Thank you.

<br/>First Letterbox on the Lake</p>
<br/>Near Holland, MI 
<br/><p align="LEFT">Greetings! We placed our first letterbox on Christmas Day, December 25, 2000 
<br/>at Saugatuck Dunes State Park, Holland, Michigan. We'd like to call it 
<br/>"First Letterbox on the Lake" - as best we can tell, it is the first on Lake 
<br/>Michigan in Michigan, there are others on the west side of the lake in 
<br/>Wisconsin.
<br/>
<br/>Placed by Rainbow's End
<br/>
<br/>Clues: Start from Saugatuck Dunes State Park. (Exit I -196 at the Saugatuck 
<br/>Exit, head southwest one block from the expressway. Turn right onto 65th 
<br/>Street. Go north one mile, then turn left onto 138th Avenue west. Follow 
<br/>138th Ave. west 3/4 mile into the park, veering right at the fork.) Proceed 
<br/>to the parking area. Look for the North trail head and start your hike here. 
<br/>
<br/>Follow this trail north. At the first main fork in the trail, approx. 1/4 
<br/>mile from the start, turn left (west) up the hill.  Follow the park trail 
<br/>signs:  they are large wooden posts with white painted caps.  During the 
<br/>first half of this walk, follow the green arrow on the post.  At the top of 
<br/>this first wooded dune climb, there is a fork in the trail, take the right 
<br/>branch.  Continue to enjoy your hike and make your way to the shore of Lake 
<br/>Michigan, following the green arrow on the white capped post. (When the 
<br/>trail comes to a "T", turn left to get to the shore.)  While at the shore, be 
<br/>sure to collect a small item to bring back with you, perhaps a smooth rock, 
<br/>no larger than your fist, or a small piece of driftwood.
<br/>
<br/>When you are ready to leave the lake, begin your hike back, starting on the 
<br/>same trail. Now you will be following the red arrow on the white capped 
<br/>wodden posts.  At the first intersection, less than 1/4 mile from the lake, 
<br/>keep straight, or due east. In a few paces, you will have the choice of 
<br/>taking the outer loop or the inner loop trail. You can pick either, both 
<br/>will take you to the letterbox. (If you are getting tired, the inner loop 
<br/>trail is a little shorter, flatter and stays in the woods more. The outer 
<br/>loop trail is a little longer, hillier and stays on the dunes more) When the 
<br/>two loop trails merge, head due south, downhill and back into the woods. In 
<br/>less than 1/4 mile, you will come to a "Y" shaped intersection, a place you 
<br/>have been before! (You will see the trail marker with the red and green 
<br/>arrow) 
<br/>
<br/>If you are standing at the base of the "Y", look south west. You will see a 
<br/>"bowl" created by the surrounding hills and dunes. Walk roughly 80 paces 
<br/>south west off of the trail, into the bowl, and head towards a large hemlock 
<br/>tree that grows within one yard of a deciduous tree. When standing under 
<br/>these trees, proceed south west another 50 paces to the point where the two 
<br/>large fallen soldiers meet. Directly ahead of you, another 10 paces south 
<br/>west, you will see a large smooth barked tree with the neck of a giraffe, 
<br/>nibbling at the uppermost leaves of its neighboring trees. At the base of 
<br/>this tree, you will find a pile of driftwood and other items from the lake. 
<br/>Under these lake shore samples, you will see the letterbox! When you open 
<br/>the letterbox and add your stamp and date, please be sure to close the 
<br/>letterbox securely. Now is the time to place the item you collected from the 
<br/>shore, adding it to the others, covering the letter box to hide it away for 
<br/>the next seeker.
