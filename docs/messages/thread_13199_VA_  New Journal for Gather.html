other day, tellling her about all the great stamps!  I ran to get Be and <br/>
Ma's journal and began flipping through it...  It was then I realized that a <br/>
five and an 8 year old, despite their incredible concern about choosing the <br/>
right combination of colors, do not stamp very well.  Almost all the images <br/>
were either too light or double printed, etc.  What a shame -- the stamper <br/>
kind of looked at all these cruddy images and smiled...<br/>
<br/>
Now these kinds of images are ok for the kids 'cause they are just excited <br/>
about getting them.  But,<br/>
<br/>
That's when I decided to get myself my very own spankin' new for mommy only <br/>
letterboxing journal.  It's leather and even smells really nice!!  I am very <br/>
excited about premiering it at the Gather.  Like the Happy Homeschoolers, we <br/>
will probably be closer to 12:30 as Da is playing tennis in the morning.  <br/>
So, hang around everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Mary -- I really look forward to getting your event stamp in the new <br/>
journal.  You'll have to go over your sticky note system for keeping the ink <br/>
neat...<br/>
<br/>
Now I may have to consider carving my own stamp...  Maybe by the next <br/>
gather.<br/>
<br/>
Look forward to seeing you all!  Let's hope for SUNSHINE  :-)<br/>
