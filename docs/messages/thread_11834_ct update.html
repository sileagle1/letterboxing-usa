rtrw!! usually were one step behind everybody, this time i guess we <br/>
were actually one step ahead. we did knight and day and melted in <br/>
chaplin and then went and did chucks in search of nessie. chuck, you <br/>
really need to start putting height requirements on some of your <br/>
boxes. i didnt have my tall sister with me, just my short aunt. we <br/>
found the worlds smelliest HH at the bogg lane box in the lebanon <br/>
loop, and had found the worlds fishiest HH at melted. we also set out <br/>
a new HH called "the worlds creepiest HH" we also found the clues for <br/>
singing men. which is the first "box" of that sort that weve ever <br/>
found. maybe well actually have some sunny weather soon to go find <br/>
the actual box.   jessie and aunt "just humming my way through"<br/>
