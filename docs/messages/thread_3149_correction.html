This is a second sending of the May 28 memo to you requesting the correction our letterbox clues.  We have visited it twice this summer and lots of fine letterboxers have found it despite the inaccurate clues.  You have posted this updated clue on May 2001 but we would prefer you replace the original one with the following corrected version.  Thank you. <br/>

First Letterbox on the Lake <br/>
Near Holland, MI <br/>
<br/>
Greetings! We placed our first letterbox on Christmas Day, December 25, 2000 <br/>
at Saugatuck Dunes State Park, Holland, Michigan.  We'd like to call it <br/>
"First Letterbox on the Lake" - as best we can tell, it is the first on Lake <br/>
Michigan in Michigan, there are others on the west side of the lake in <br/>
Wisconsin. <br/>
<br/>
Placed by Rainbow's End <br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Start from Saugatuck Dunes State Park. (Exit I -196 at the Saugatuck <br/>
Exit, head southwest one block from the expressway.  Turn right onto 65th <br/>
Street.  Go north one mile, then turn left onto 138th Avenue west.  Follow <br/>
138th Ave. west 3/4 mile into the park, veering right at the fork.)  Proceed <br/>
to the parking area.  Look for the North trail head and start your hike here. <br/>
<br/>
Follow this trail north.  At the first main fork in the trail, approx. 1/4 <br/>
mile from the start, turn left (west) up the hill.  Follow the park trail <br/>
signs:  they are large wooden posts with white painted caps.  During the <br/>
first half of this walk, follow the green arrow on the post.  At the top of <br/>
this first wooded dune climb, there is a fork in the trail, take the right <br/>
branch.  Continue to enjoy your hike and make your way to the shore of Lake <br/>
Michigan, following the green arrow on the white capped post.  (When the <br/>
trail comes to a "T", turn left to get to the shore.)  While at the shore, be <br/>
sure to collect a small item to bring back with you, perhaps a smooth rock, <br/>
no larger than your fist, or a small piece of driftwood. <br/>
<br/>
When you are ready to leave the lake, begin your hike back, starting on the <br/>
same trail.  Now you will be following the red arrow on the white capped <br/>
wodden posts.  At the first intersection, less than 1/4 mile from the lake, <br/>
keep straight, or due east.  In a few paces, you will have the choice of <br/>
taking the outer loop or the inner loop trail.  You can pick either, both <br/>
will take you to the letterbox.  (If you are getting tired, the inner loop <br/>
trail is a little shorter, flatter and stays in the woods more.  The outer <br/>
loop trail is a little longer, hillier and stays on the dunes more)  When the <br/>
two loop trails merge, head due south, downhill and back into the woods.  In <br/>
less than 1/4 mile, you will  come to a "Y" shaped intersection, a place you <br/>
have been before!  (You will see the trail marker with the red and green <br/>
arrow) <br/>
<br/>
If you are standing at the base of the "Y", look south west.  You will see a <br/>
"bowl" created by the surrounding hills and dunes.  Walk roughly 80 paces <br/>
south west off of the trail, into the bowl, and head towards a large hemlock <br/>
tree that grows within one yard of a deciduous tree.  When standing under <br/>
these trees, proceed south west another 50 paces to the point where the two <br/>
large fallen soldiers meet.  Directly ahead of you, another 10 paces south <br/>
west, you will see a large smooth barked tree with the neck of a giraffe, <br/>
nibbling at the uppermost leaves of its neighboring trees.  At the base of <br/>
this tree, you will find a pile of driftwood and other items from the lake. <br/>
 Under these lake shore samples, you will see the letterbox! When you open <br/>
the letterbox and add your stamp and date, please be sure to close the <br/>
letterbox securely.  Now is the time to place the item you collected from the <br/>
shore, adding it to the others, covering the letter box to hide it away for <br/>
the next seeker. <br/>
