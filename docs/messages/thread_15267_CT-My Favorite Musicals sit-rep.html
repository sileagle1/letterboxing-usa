lingo!  How fun.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... I enjoyed a great (albeit...buggy!) day yesterday working <br/>
on the My Favorite Musicals series in Mansfield, CT.  I believe, <br/>
however, that Marta Von Trapp and Phantom of the Opera are both <br/>
missing.  I'm not positive that Phantom is not "supposed" to be <br/>
missing (we are talking a ghost here, afterall)... but I'm pretty <br/>
sure Marta was supposed to be under her pretty pink quartz rock... <br/>
and she wasn't.  <br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find Shirley Temple to save my life, but that was probably <br/>
just me.  Also, Oklahoma got away, but again, I believe that was <br/>
pilot error.  All told, I did get 17 of the series and I thank <br/>
(profusely!) Pink Trotters and Leader of the Pack for an awesome <br/>
series.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>

coordinates of 25 degrees (?  I don't remember exactly), then its is there... try <br/>
250 or 225 and see what you get  :-)<br/>
