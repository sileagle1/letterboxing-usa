have planted two boxes and one hitchhiker. The second box I planted <br/>
was a bonus box with clues inside the first box I planted. I went to <br/>
go check on the boxes this weekend and guess what!! The bonus box is <br/>
MIA. Oh well. I guess I have hit the big time. I can now claim a MIA <br/>
box as well as finds, and places. <br/>
