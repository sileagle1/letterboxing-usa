we've found.  We also found the New Jersey in Maryland Box.  I found <br/>
the clues on the old LBNA website. I think it was listed as Maryland <br/>
Monkey box, or something like that.  I'm not sure why they're not on <br/>
the new site.  The box is still there, very safe and dry.  And <br/>
current, too.  The logbook said #2, and was placed in June of this <br/>
year.  Very cool spot for a box!  I'm getting ready to carve my next <br/>
stamp.  I may make this one a mystery box.  Hmmmm, haven't decided <br/>
yet.<br/>

the library was closed. We considered ourselves lucky just to have <br/>
found the library; that took us about 30 minutes. I'd suggest taking <br/>
a good map. Who knew it was tucked away like that.<br/>
