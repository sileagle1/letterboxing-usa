this week (excerpted from another posting on Wednesday, 7/12)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I saw a lawyer yesterday for about an hour. He actually lives only <br/>
two miles from me, and was recommended to me by the lawyer I had <br/>
first contacted as one who knew the most about non-profit <br/>
corporations. He has done a lot of work with food coops in the state. <br/>
However, he is a bit of a recluse, I think, and I can't really speak <br/>
for his credentials. I liked him, for what that's worth. He seemed <br/>
quite interested to learn that there were three boxes within a mile <br/>
of his house, and was going to the computer as I left.<br/>
<br/>
It took a while to really explain just what it is we do, both in the <br/>
woods and on the web, but when once he understood that, and I think <br/>
he did, he made these points:<br/>
<br/>
We have been fine so far with our loose organization. We are at very <br/>
little risk of being sued by anyone who gets hurt looking for a box. <br/>
The person who placed the box in a dangerous place might be <br/>
successfully sued, but not the people who posted the clues. The <br/>
looseness of our organization is a help. He looked at our disclaimer <br/>
and said it was fine.<br/>
<br/>
If the only thing we are considering doing differently is getting <br/>
money to pay for a website, there is still no reason to incorporate. <br/>
We can certainly ask people fo contributions, or fees (not dues), <br/>
without being incorporated. It would not be hard to give an <br/>
accounting  on a web page of who had contributed money and how much, <br/>
and what we had spent it on. No problem with accountability.<br/>
<br/>
We can give patches away, and use the contributions to pay for them, <br/>
but don't make them conditions for contributing. He advised <br/>
definitely against getting into the business of selling t-shirts or <br/>
mugs. However, he did say there was no problem in ordering things on <br/>
request and selling them at cost. What Kay (Mohmers) is doing for us <br/>
with the patches is not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, he urged strongly against the hassles involved in <br/>
becoming even a non-profit organization.<br/>
<br/>
There were more questions I might have asked about incorporation, I <br/>
suppose (e.g. states which don't charge $300 a year for non-profit <br/>
corp taxes), but I wasn't feeling inclined to at that point.<br/>
