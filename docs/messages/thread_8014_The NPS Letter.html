                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spoke with Dwight Dixon, the ranger from the C&amp;O canal who wrote <br/>
the letter, today. Real nice and understanding dude.<br/>
Yes! I did it the old fashion way, I called the gentleman up on the <br/>
telephone. <br/>
<br/>
He stated that he recently learned about letterboxing, and that he <br/>
thinks that it is a very interesting sport and can understand the <br/>
interest and fun in the sport. He did state that he is familiar with <br/>
geocaching and that he has removed numerous boxes from that sport.<br/>
<br/>
 He stated at present time it is not illegal to hide boxes in the NP.<br/>
BUT in the future it may. At present the NPS is looking into revising <br/>
their CFR 36 report, so that geocaching and letterboxing will be <br/>
illegal. And mostly do to the fact that geocaching has been the <br/>
greatest problem for the park service.<br/>
<br/>
He did comment that at present it is up to the park superintendent of <br/>
a region to decide which park may have harsher public use limitations <br/>
than other parks.<br/>
<br/>
AND this all has to do with:<br/>
1. Enviromental issues <br/>
For example protecting rare plants. You may plant a box at a time <br/>
that the plant is hidden under the ground and later when it is above <br/>
ground, someone else who is so excited about finding a box tramples <br/>
and kills the plant.<br/>
<br/>
2.Preserving historical sites.<br/>
For example,  gate locks, hidden indian burial sites, hidden civil <br/>
war campsites. He stated that the NPS does not let the public know <br/>
the location of these sites in fear of vandals. And that they would <br/>
not like them to be damaged because of people looking in that area <br/>
for a box.<br/>
<br/>
3.The welfare of the hiker/letterboxer/geocacher.<br/>
He stated that this year there had been three people who had been <br/>
bitten by snakes in the park.<br/>
Last year a geocacher while reaching into a hole was bitten by a bat.<br/>
ANd then there have been boxes hidden up high on cliffs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We then dicussed his comment about boxes being perceived as bombs. He <br/>
stated that each week someone calls the office informing the rangers <br/>
of a suspicious looking box. And that they must go out, do their job <br/>
and remove the box. <br/>
<br/>
He did state that if any letterboxer wishes to hide a box that you <br/>
CAN, but you must FIRST ask permission, get a permit and be shown <br/>
where it would be o.k. to plant the box. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This all sound fair to me. I think the man is just doing his job. And <br/>
the park service is trying to protect the park so that everyone can <br/>
enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
As someone pointed out the other day there are other places to plant <br/>
boxes.<br/>

I live in CT with no NP's and was wondering who I could talk to in <br/>
the Park service. This issue has gotten a bit blown out of proportion <br/>
as I've only seen one park region that actually has a problem with <br/>
letterboxing. My guess is most have never even heard about it. I <br/>
believe if you talk to the Park rangers, they will most likly let you <br/>
plant a box, with their having site approval. I do believe a letter <br/>
writting campaign to the district ranger in the DC area would help <br/>
show just how many people value this hobby and how it brings more <br/>
people to OUR National Parks. Maybe we could convince Mr Dixon to <br/>
give us a way to contact him or a staff member about planting some <br/>
boxes with their help and posting the clues at the Visitor Center, <br/>
like I've seen at some State Parks. Maybe even a gathering at a Park, <br/>
with a combination litter gathering day? I envy you people down in <br/>
the DC area with all your NP's. Do you think you could obtain an <br/>
address for us to write (nice) letters to Mr. Dixon or another <br/>
official. Thanks for your initiative.<br/>

waiting for the million dollars that keeps flashing at me.<br/>

For information on the C&amp;O canal NPS go to www.cando.org,then click <br/>
contact info on left side of page. This will bring you to <br/>
www.candocanal.org/board.html. Scroll down to Directory for C&amp;O canal <br/>
NPS , which lists personnel and phone#s. If anyone is interested in <br/>
Mr. Dixon he can be found under Western Md district.<br/>
<br/>
As to other regions in the US, well you will just have to let your <br/>
fingers do the walking thru the internet.<br/>
