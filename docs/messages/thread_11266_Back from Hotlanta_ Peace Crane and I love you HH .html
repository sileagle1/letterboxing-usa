Luckily the long hike to the peace crane Box<br/>
conveniently put us back near the B&amp;B where we were<br/>
staying.  We were surprised more people haven't done<br/>
this box. there were only a few stamps in it.  I would<br/>
advise people to take MARTA rather than driving<br/>
because the start and finish are relatively close to<br/>
MARTA stations.  You end up in a really cool<br/>
neighborhood at the end.  The only problem we had was<br/>
that we used the wrong #'s for the math problem or the<br/>
compass  direction was way off.  We would advise<br/>
checking around for other trees that match the hiding<br/>
place description.  We found it by accident after we<br/>
had given up.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the I Love you HH has also made it into the South<br/>
from  its starting place in New England.<br/>
