<div>You'll want to familiarize yourself with the Area 
51 lore with a basic internet search, if you don't know about it already.  
To find this hidden box, you'll first need to find the infamous 'Black 
Mailbox'.   This leads you down a dirt/gravel road which joins a road 
that officially does not exist.  Go as far as you can, you'll know you 
can't go any further when you see the signs forbidding you to proceed, plus 
the "Cammo Dudes" will be watching you at this point.  Look for them in 
their truck on top of the hill.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Facing the continuing road, look to the 
right.  You should see a small hill with a trail heading to the top.  
At the bottom  of this little hill, next to the trail, should be a large 
rock on the right side, with a smaller rock in front of it.  Move the 
smaller rock and beneath should be what you're looking for.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you make it into the little town of Rachel 
you've passed the 'Black Mailbox', but that's okay.  Stop at the Little 
Ale'Inn and have yourself some good food, and seek the help of the people there, 
they'll be more than happy to point you in the right direction.  Have fun 
and be careful...remember, they're watching you.  You'll be very happy that 
you made the trip! </div></div></div></body></html>

<p>Having lived in the area before, this sounds like a fun box to seek. I would remind everybody though that this is rattle snake and scorpion territory! PLEASE BE EXTRA EXTRA CAREFULL when moving rocks in this area!!!!!!!<br/></p></div>
