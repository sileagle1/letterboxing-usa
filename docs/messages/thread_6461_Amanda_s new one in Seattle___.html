other day, and woohoooo!  Not only is it there, I was able to find it <br/>
(which has been a feat for me thelast few trips out), AND I was the <br/>
first signer!!<br/>
<br/>
*happy dance*<br/>
<br/>
It's well-hidden, so hopefully it'll be okay, even with arduous <br/>
gardeners doing their painstaking manicuring of the foliage.  (I didn't <br/>
realize there'd be more than one rock, too, so I had to poke around, act <br/>
casual as people wandered by, poke some more, act like I was VERY <br/>
INVOLVED in reading that map, and then poke to find it once the second <br/>
group went by. :)<br/>
<br/>
It's a gorgeous park, too -- I've been a member over at the Japanese <br/>
Gardens in the Arboretum for a while now, and have been trying to figure <br/>
out how to get a box over there, but haven't had much luck.  So this was <br/>
like an idea-in-a-box for me, too.<br/>
<br/>
Great box, Amanda!  It's there, safe, and waiting for more people to <br/>
come stamp in!  (it's kid-friendly, by the way.  Go!  Go now!  Knock off <br/>
early from work and go! :&gt;)<br/>

Thanks for a really neat adventure through one of the most beautiful <br/>
places in Seattle--Kubota Gardens!  I never even knew it existed <br/>
before you 'boxed' it.  What a gorgeous stamp, too! Boy, did I get a <br/>
lot of ideas for my upcoming landscaping project from the trek <br/>
through Kubota... <br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail...<br/>
