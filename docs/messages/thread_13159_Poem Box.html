Dave McCarthy: Poetry project makes magic in the woods <br/>
05/28/2003 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
RICHMOND -- To find a poem box amidst the glen, lovely surprise<br/>
<br/>
I stop and wonder and remember 'Old Uncle Frank'<br/>
<br/>
who introduced me to poetry, song, dance and the sky<br/>
<br/>
Here he is today falling from heaven with the raindrops<br/>
<br/>
That touching note was left, unsigned, in a wooden box at Richmond <br/>
Landing, a dandy little state-run access area off Route 91 that is <br/>
used by fishermen seeking trout in the Wood River.<br/>
<br/>
The birdhouse-sized box is nailed to a tree in the woods next to the <br/>
fishermen's access -- a bucolic setting, complete with an old dam, <br/>
roaring white water, and, sometimes, trout.<br/>
<br/>
Time's up<br/>
<br/>
moving downstream<br/>
<br/>
with the current<br/>
<br/>
The old elusive trout<br/>
<br/>
is nowhere about<br/>
<br/>
That from another note left in the box.<br/>
<br/>
The box encourages such notes, for it is no ordinary box.<br/>
<br/>
This one was gaily decorated by students at the Charlestown <br/>
(Elementary) School. Tacked to it are wooden inchworms in all sorts <br/>
of colors, and a big red wooden ladybug.<br/>
<br/>
Douglas Florian's famous poem about inchworms, etched into the inside <br/>
of the little box, greets the curious who open the box's door.<br/>
<br/>
A pencil and pad encourage the curious to reply with their own odes <br/>
to the outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
Throw your arms around a tree<br/>
<br/>
the tree doesn't care, it's wood<br/>
<br/>
take a saw and cut down<br/>
<br/>
that tree<br/>
<br/>
the tree doesn't care<br/>
<br/>
but you should<br/>
<br/>
That unsigned ode came from another of the little boxes, this one at <br/>
the Arcadia deer check station off Route 165 in Exeter.<br/>
<br/>
The box in Exeter and the one in Richmond are among 12 creatively <br/>
decorated boxes scattered throughout the 197,000-acre, 300-mile-<br/>
square watershed of the Wood and Pawcatuck Rivers.<br/>
<br/>
The watershed stretches from Coventry and West and East Greenwich in <br/>
the north, through South County to Westerly in the south, and <br/>
includes four Connecticut towns.<br/>
<br/>
Sixty-five percent of the watershed is undeveloped. "It is one of the <br/>
more pristine watersheds in New England," is the way Ana Flores put <br/>
its.<br/>
<br/>
Those birdhouse-sized boxes of poems are the brainchild of Flores, a <br/>
renowned Charlestown sculptor who has just taken up a six-month <br/>
station as artist-in-residence for the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed <br/>
Association.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of Poetry in the Wild is two-fold: to show, as Flores <br/>
said, "how the natural world has influenced so many poets," and, in <br/>
return, to get people thinking about the wild by sharing their <br/>
thoughts and reflections about their interactions with nature.<br/>
<br/>
Poetry in the Wild was also designed to involve the community -- in <br/>
assembling and decorating the boxes, choosing poems to go into each <br/>
box, installing the boxes, and monitoring them by volunteer "poetry <br/>
wardens."<br/>
<br/>
Seven of the boxes were designed by school children in Charlestown, <br/>
Ashaway, and in Exeter, and the others by artists and would-be <br/>
artists.<br/>
<br/>
The volunteers serving as "poetry wardens" have the job of making <br/>
sure the boxes have pads and working pencils, and gathering the <br/>
thoughts left behind on paper by the hikers and fishermen.<br/>
<br/>
But there is also a loftier, albeit more remote, goal.<br/>
<br/>
Showing visitors a poem box at Meadow Brook Pond, Flores had to play <br/>
trash collector the other morning as she scooped up an empty vodka <br/>
bottle someone had thrown in the woods.<br/>
<br/>
"How you turn people from slobs to poetry is my very idealistic way <br/>
of thinking," she said.<br/>
<br/>
Meadow Brook Pond is a favorite of fly fishermen who wear bib-style <br/>
rubber waders to get to the best fishing spots.<br/>
<br/>
One of them left this message on the pad in the Meadow Brook Pond <br/>
box: Thanks for a wonderful surprise this afternoon of fishing...<br/>
<br/>
Although a list is available of where the boxes have been placed, <br/>
surprise is good, Flores said.<br/>
<br/>
"If people just stumble on them, I don't mind them being surprised," <br/>
she said. "It's just kind of a nice surprise to have in the woods."<br/>
<br/>
The Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed Association has been surprised, too -- <br/>
by the large number of replies that have kept the wardens hopping, <br/>
and by a lack of vandalism.<br/>
<br/>
"I thought we would have to deal with vandalism, but the boxes have <br/>
been very well-respected, which is a nice comment on human nature," <br/>
Flores said.<br/>
<br/>
Poetry in the Wild began April 19, funded in part by the Rhode Island <br/>
State Council on the Arts.<br/>
<br/>
Randall Rosenbaum, the council's executive director, said it is not <br/>
unusual for it to sponsor such "exhilarating" environmental art.<br/>
<br/>
"I find artists to be extremely environment-friendly," Rosenbaum <br/>
said, explaining that "artists tend to be connected to 'place.' "<br/>
<br/>
He cited such examples as the sculpture outside the Rhode Island <br/>
Resource Recovery Corporation's education center, made of trash from <br/>
the corporation's Johnston landfill -- an artistic reminder of the <br/>
need to recycle.<br/>
<br/>
The Poetry in the Wild's boxes are scheduled to come down June 24, <br/>
although the project could continue if there's a demand and if more <br/>
volunteers sign up to relieve the current crop of hard-pressed box <br/>
wardens.<br/>
<br/>
The closing of the project will be celebrated with an evening of <br/>
poetry and music on the banks of the Wood River. The celebration is <br/>
set for Friday, June 27, from 6 to 8 p.m., on the Wood-Pawcatuck <br/>
Watershed Association's campus, Aracdia Road, Hope Valley.<br/>
<br/>
It is here one finds remembrance,<br/>
<br/>
comfort, simple joys and a reason for living.<br/>
<br/>
On the path to happiness<br/>
<br/>
I make this a frequent rest stop.<br/>
<br/>
That reply was left in the poetry box at Napatree Point on Watch Hill.<br/>
<br/>
It, and the other replies, tend to back up Flores' summation of her <br/>
project:<br/>
<br/>
"The need to express ourselves came out of our direct connection to <br/>
the natural world. I wanted this project not to detract from the <br/>
wildness that we are still so fortunate to have around us, but to <br/>
help punctuate it. Ideally I would hope to encourage people to engage <br/>
with nature with the consciousness of poets; treading lightly and <br/>
responsibly, sharing their thoughts and not their trash."<br/>

<br/>
Where the boxes are <br/>
The Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed Association has placed 12 "poetry" boxes <br/>
in the watershed. The boxes, works of art themselves, contain a poem <br/>
by a famous poet, and a pad and pencil for a response. The birdhouse-<br/>
sized boxes are at the following sites:<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ah, the Poetry Boxes - they're lovely! We discovered them by accident <br/>
a couple of weeks ago, and signed in "letterbox-style", but couldn't <br/>
count them as finds because they had no stamps!( even though some <br/>
folks might consider finding beautiful boxes out in the woods with <br/>
poems by the likes of Emily Dickinson, Robert Frost and Czeslaw <br/>
Milosz - for whom I once did translation! - far better than <br/>
finding "mere stamps"! :-) Anyway, we actually asked Jay Drew at our <br/>
last get-together if he'd have any interest in putting some stamps <br/>
in, since he's one of our most renowned local carvers. There are <br/>
plenty of other good carvers around, too, though, so if anyone else <br/>
wanted to discreetly put a little temporary stamp in any of those <br/>
boxes, that would probably be OK with the box owners, who would most <br/>
likely consider it just another nice little "artistic touch":-)  I'm <br/>
not much of a carver myself, but I'd be willing to put in a couple of <br/>
stone-backed "impromptus", say for the 2 Napatree Point boxes, if <br/>
anyone else wanted to take on any of the others! What do you folks <br/>
out there think? Any interest?<br/>
