Terrain: Very Easy<br/>
<br/>
Redwood Forest Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Located at the site of the "Drive-through Tree" in Leggett, <br/>
California.  This letterbox is located in a somewhat high traffic <br/>
area.  So please be careful to not reveal it's location.<br/>
<br/>
How to get there:<br/>
<br/>
  Drive or walk down the short path to the drive-through tree.  Drive <br/>
through the tree if you want.  Located between the tree and the pond <br/>
there is a fallen tree that is hollowed out.  People like to stand in <br/>
this log and have their pictures taken.  Standing from here and <br/>
looking in the direction of the highway, there is a large fallen log <br/>
about 100ft away.  About 50ft Beyond that is another smaller fallen <br/>
log.  From this second log turn left and there is another large, <br/>
triangular shaped log or stump about 25-50ft away. Look underneath <br/>
this log for the box.  (Also, don't worry about locating logs at <br/>
distances of 100ft or more.  These are Redwood logs and you can't <br/>
miss them.)<br/>
<br/>
  It might be a good idea to stealthily snag the box and walk over to <br/>
the picnic table area to sign the book so people won't wonder what <br/>
you are doing.<br/>
<br/>
