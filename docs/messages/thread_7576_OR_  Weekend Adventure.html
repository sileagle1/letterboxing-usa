On Sunday my wife and I went to Troutdale to search for Letterboxes.  <br/>
Last week we found Love Hitchhiker #3 at ponytail falls.  We dropped <br/>
it off in one of the boxes we found on our recent trip.<br/>
<br/>
Here is what we found.<br/>
<br/>
Blue Lake - Box was in the right place but was on top of some logs.  <br/>
We hid it a little better than we found it.<br/>
<br/>
Broughton's Bluff - The hike to this box was more steep and with <br/>
difficult terrain than we expected but we made it to a live box.<br/>
<br/>
Beaver Creek #1 - lots of steps.  Box alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Oxbow Series - Box 1 was there but we couldn't find box 2.  We found <br/>
a what we think the spot was.  There was a good place for a letterbox <br/>
there but it was empty.<br/>
<br/>
Riverbend - A recent plant from Funhog.  We found the box alive and <br/>
previously unfound.<br/>
