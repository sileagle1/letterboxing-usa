Got the word from my daughter that "Mr. Bindle Santa" is seriously<br/>
looking at getting one of these for my gift. (He never shops until<br/>
Christmas Eve then goes on a commando mission ... lol)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone out there who has one of these backpack and stool combo units<br/>
willing to give some input on how well it would work tossed over just<br/>
one shoulder?  I'm one of those lazy types who almost always throws my<br/>
backpack over just one shoulder.  I have concerns that the frame would<br/>
make this type of carry impractical.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

I'm very interested in a backpack/stool combo.  Would you please <br/>
email info to me off-list, if you don't mind?  (I don't want to start <br/>
any flames!)<br/>

Thank you,<br/>

Thanks everyone for all the help on this subject. Mr BindleSanta did<br/>
get me a very nice combo backpack and stool for Christmas. So far, the<br/>
Michigan weather hasn't encouraged me to get out boxing much so the<br/>
only place I've tried it out is indoors. <br/>
<br/>
Like Hikers n Hounds, I tend to over-pack (lol ... ask Doglvrs,<br/>
everytime we need anything they just look at my backpack .. and like<br/>
magic, yep ... it's in there!) so I really appreciate the hint about<br/>
padding the stool frame and may do that to mine as well.<br/>
<br/>
Hubby ended up getting me one that is a regular two-strap backpack<br/>
style and I think this will work out best. I agree with Pam and Grace,<br/>
a single strap would swing around too much if doing any scrambling. <br/>
I'm still lazy about tossing a backpack over only one shoulder most of<br/>
the time but at least this will give me the option of a more secure<br/>
carry. Thanks again for the input everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

I would do great on that old game show where you had to produce strange items from your bag inorder to be selected as a guest. Good luck with your pack and don't make it too heavy. <br/>
