her geocaching adventure when she finds a cache full<br/>

didn't trade for "like value".<br/>
<br/>
by the way, lizzardbutt, are you REALLY five years<br/>
old? your vocabulary sounds like, well, you're MUCH<br/>
older! if you're truly five, i'm very impressed! happy<br/>
hunting!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry folks, but for a kid geocaching is the<br/>
&gt; ultimate. We did our <br/>
&gt; first geocaching today and there were lots of cool<br/>
&gt; toys to pick from. <br/>
&gt; Can you believe this? I got to trade a plastic<br/>
&gt; picnic fork for a <br/>
&gt; really cool spinning top! Plus, we found the site<br/>
&gt; thanks to the GPS<br/>
&gt; (that GPS is really smart). I thought this was great<br/>
&gt; because I didn't <br/>
&gt; have to walk so much. Sad to say, Mom likes the<br/>
&gt; challenge of reading <br/>
&gt; the clues to find the site. Well, I need to find a<br/>
&gt; solution to this <br/>
&gt; dilemma. So as an advocate for kids, who hate to<br/>
&gt; walk, I would like <br/>
&gt; to see more HYBRID BOXES PLEASE!<br/>
