<div>The sun was out!  The kids were off from school and Mom felt like braving the beltway all - the - way - into - MARYLAND (you know, Virginians normally do not like to cross the bridges...)  With a little help from the map (east west highway is a long street) we found our way to Candy Cane City!  What a beautiful day to play outside!  They had some neat playground equipment too -- the zip wire, that bouncy thing (I believe that is the technical term for it...).  We had a great time walking by the stream which was pretty full.  We especially liked the two scary eyes!  The directions led us right to the box and we sat on the log (not on the screws) to stamp in.  While Ma and I were stamping in we looked for Be who was no where to be seen.  Well, the water was flowing pretty strong, but, it turns out that he had just wandered down lower on the bank, out of eyesight, and not into the current (phew! - nervous mom)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The only thing better than a cool playground -- horses!  It was interesting hearing Miss Ma's theory on how to tell the boy horses from the girls (the boys have darker manes...)  I wasn't going to touch that one...  We couldn't figure out how a brick jump could be moved....  Luckily we sighted the mom with her slender daughters and got our bearing from that.  I think our paces were steps or our steps were paces...  Anyway -- neat hiding place!</div>

<div>Thank you knitwit mom for these two new boxes and a chance to visit these great places (they were worth going across state lines).  We really liked your sig stamp -- very cute!</div>

Thanks for the nice feedback. I'm actually on my second <br/>
personal stamp already since Puppy Boy and Barbie Girl did in <br/>
the first one with unauthorized stamping.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you could make it to the wilds of Maryland--we Marylanders <br/>
can be the same way. But, if I could go to Fredericksburg for Fish <br/>
or Fowl, I ought to be able to get to Northern Virginia!<br/>
