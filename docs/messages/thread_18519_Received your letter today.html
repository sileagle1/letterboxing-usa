I received your letter today, how exciting! It's so cool that this hobby is international but we here in America all hail Dartmoor as the Mecca of letterboxing. My son Carmen is working on our "traveller" stamp and i will mail it to you as soon as he's finished. The problem is he has a new girlfriend who now seems a little more interesting to him than letterboxing with Mom! But in the meantime I will mail you some of our images. i will certaily be glad to collect images here in the USA to send to you as well. But I am not a very good hunter! I go out every weekend but don't always find a box. Nevertheless, I will try. There are a lot of store bought stams used in the USA, do you want those images as well? Well, I've got to leave for work now. Thanks so much for contacting the LBNA list. This is so much fun! Take care,<br/>
