I just posted 3 photos of a letterbox I retrieved from a lake.  One of <br/>
my letterobxing goals was to retrieve one from water - so I was really <br/>
pleased to find this one.<br/>
<br/>
The series would have been better if I had a shot of it floating in the <br/>
lake, before I scooped it up.  The owner (Sprite and Highlander) was <br/>
very pleased to hear about the rescue.<br/>
<br/>
This album is open to all members, I am looking forward to more shots <br/>
of rescued letterboxes.  Find it in the photo section of this <br/>
newsgroup.  I reduced the resolution so they download quickly.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I rescued one in Hueston Woods near Dayton, OH.  A racoon (probably) <br/>
had gotten hold of it and the container lid was all we found.  We did <br/>
however find the stamp AND the log book.  I'll post pics soon, but the <br/>
stamp was pretty chewed up and the log book was partially bug eaten.  <br/>
Dried it out and am going to send it to the OP.  Normally I wouldn't <br/>
have removed the stamp, but since the box was gone, I felt I had to.  <br/>
I also contacted the OP to let them know the stamp was out of <br/>
comission...<br/>
