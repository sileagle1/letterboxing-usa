Please clarify where you would be posting your result and have the ability to let other know something is missing.<br/>
<br/>
If you post to LBNA, you can indicate how many you found, but that does not show up for other users. Certainly there is no field for comments.<br/>
<br/>
If you post to AQ, you can indicate which ones you found which is fine it is designed that way, but again no comment is posted. It is only sent to the owner.<br/>
<br/>
You may have a website of your own where you keep track of things and that is great. Other boxers have some pretty terrific sites for this purpose but it is generally frowned upon to give away any information about the location of a box. Everything the owner wants people to know is in their clues. And remember just because you couldn't locate it doesn't mean it isn't there. It is quite possible you took a wrong turn or misinterpretted one of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
You have done more than your part and that was notifying the owner of a potential problem. What the owner does with the information is up to them.<br/>

Good work!<br/>

Quite honestly unless you have found those boxes before and know exactly<br/>
where they are supposed to be, they may be right where they belong, and you<br/>
were off-base in where you were looking.  I can't tell you how many times<br/>
I've sworn I was looking in exactly the right place, only to find that when<br/>
I cleared what I KNEW was the right place out of my head, the real right<br/>
place was right under my nose!  And I can't tell you how many times folks<br/>
who have looked for my boxes and written to say either the clues were wrong<br/>
or the box was gone, only to write again later to apologize because they had<br/>
gone back and rethought it and found the box easily...<br/>

You can do a search of the forums to see if the boxes were mentioned. Go to the United States Letterboxing page: http://www.atlasquest.com/boards/category.html?gCatId=4<br/>
Scroll down to the bottom of the list of States and you'll see a search box.<br/>

- Kevin of EB<br/>
<br/>
*****No matter where you post that would be publicly read, you really<br/>
shouldn't say the boxes are gone or missing.  You can say you didn't find<br/>
them, because that is the only thing you can truly definitely attest to<br/>
being so.<br/>
<br/>
Not being able to find them doesn't mean they are gone or missing.  It may<br/>
mean that when you read "big tree" you were thinking of a tree bigger than<br/>
the placer, or smaller, and so weren't looking by the right "big tree".   Or<br/>
your compass may have been reacting to your wristwatch and so wasn't giving<br/>
a true direction so that when you went where you thought was 40 degrees, you<br/>
really weren't 40 degrees.  Or a tree the placer referred to in the clues<br/>
had been chopped down so you didn't turn left in the right place because the<br/>
landmark was gone.  It could have easily been an innocent error on your part<br/>
that put you where you thought it should have been but wasn't, or it could<br/>
be that landmarks have changed and the placer needs to update the clues, or<br/>
it could be that the placer wrote stinky clues.  So you see - there are a<br/>
lot of reasons you might not have found the boxes, but not all of them<br/>
necessarily means the boxes are gone or missing.<br/>
<br/>
I had one box in particular that I was convinced was missing.  I went and<br/>
looked and looked, probably for an hour.  I had found a place that exactly<br/>
fit the description in the clues and my son and I doggedly searched.  I<br/>
returned home and emailed the placer that the box was gone.  As it happened,<br/>
she had just checked it the day before, so she knew it was there.  I was<br/>
skeptical, because we had searched high and low, diligently followed the<br/>
clues and everything.  And someone logged it the day after I tried.<br/>
Finally, after a few more folks found it with no problem, I went back for<br/>
it, and sure enough with fresh eyes and a fresh mind, I immediately found<br/>
the spot that even more perfectly matched the clues.  I felt really silly!<br/>
I'm just glad I didn't report it missing on any of the talk lists or I<br/>
would've felt like a flat out fool.<br/>
<br/>
As a rule of thumb, always only report publicly what you can absolutely know<br/>
to be true.  And always, always try to avoid reporting a box "missing",<br/>
since that can potentially be a death sentence for a box - who wants to go<br/>
hunting what has been reported missing?  And you can really only know they<br/>
are missing if you've found them before and they aren't where you had<br/>
previously found them...<br/>
<br/>
That isn't to say I don't understand your frustration - thinking that other<br/>
folks will go try to find the same boxes you KNOW are gone is very<br/>
frustrating!   I've got one or two in my area that fit that situation too!<br/>

  Quite honestly unless you have found those boxes before and know exactly<br/>
  where they are supposed to be, they may be right where they belong, and you<br/>
  were off-base in where you were looking. I can't tell you how many times<br/>
  I've sworn I was looking in exactly the right place, only to find that when<br/>
  I cleared what I KNEW was the right place out of my head, the real right<br/>
  place was right under my nose! And I can't tell you how many times folks<br/>
  who have looked for my boxes and written to say either the clues were wrong<br/>
  or the box was gone, only to write again later to apologize because they had<br/>
  gone back and rethought it and found the box easily...<br/>

I went back for the third time and found the box. The placer has offered to give me help if I cannot find the box.  I live in RI and have had so far fun finding the boxes. I become a monster when I cannot find the box. So any help I can get form the placer I will gladly take. I don realize you have rules for letterboxing. I think some of you could be a little nicer to each other. The tone in some of the e-mails I've read seam to be a little harsh. <br/>

&gt; forums.  As far as I can tell, there is no way to search the forums <br/>
&gt; there to see if anyone else has reported this - is there?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the report, I just meant that I would say something like "Box <br/>
&gt; 2, 5, 7 are gone" and explain why we reached that conclusion.  (Some <br/>
&gt; boxes are there, some we weren't sure of, and others were gone for <br/>

&gt; &gt; Please clarify where you would be posting your result and have the <br/>
&gt; ability to let other know something is missing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you post to LBNA, you can indicate how many you found, but that <br/>
&gt; does not show up for other users. Certainly there is no field for <br/>
&gt; comments.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you post to AQ, you can indicate which ones you found which is <br/>
&gt; fine it is designed that way, but again no comment is posted. It is <br/>
&gt; only sent to the owner.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; You may have a website of your own where you keep track of things <br/>
&gt; and that is great. Other boxers have some pretty terrific sites for <br/>
&gt; this purpose but it is generally frowned upon to give away any <br/>
&gt; information about the location of a box. Everything the owner wants <br/>
&gt; people to know is in their clues. And remember just because you <br/>
&gt; couldn't locate it doesn't mean it isn't there. It is quite possible <br/>
&gt; you took a wrong turn or misinterpretted one of the clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; You have done more than your part and that was notifying the owner <br/>
&gt; of a potential problem. What the owner does with the information is <br/>
&gt; up to them.<br/>

There should be several hundred boxes total in your region described, <br/>
