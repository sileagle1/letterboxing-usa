Where are you?  I know you are out there.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know where the usual suspects of traveling event stamps <br/>
are?  I am specifically hoping to locate the LbNA map and K-Mart ha.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows where these are please write me off list at <br/>

&gt; I quest for some of the traveling event stamps to take to the 2nd <br/>
&gt; Annual VA/DC/MD Winter Icebreaker gather on 1/29 in Arlington, <br/>
VA.  <br/>
&gt; If you have any leads please write me off list at <br/>

stamp <br/>
