                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found the Crystal Cove/Moro Canyon letterbox.  It was in good condition except that the ziplock bag no longer zipped.  I put the stamp and log book in a new bag.<br/>

Thinking I was smart, I decided to bypass the long loop around and go straight up the BFI trail.  I have come to the conclusion that BFI stands for Big Fat Idiot who should follow the Box's Favored Instructions before taking the Big Freakin' Incline trail.  I also stupidly didn't bring any water so I was toasting in the bright afternoon sun.  I was starting to get worried when I saw a vulture flying overhead.<br/>
<br/>
But, I made it!  Nice view! <br/>
