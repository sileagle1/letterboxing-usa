I have seen it mentioned many times in the last several weeks that <br/>
the "contact the placer" function does not work. Has anyone in <br/>
authority tested it and verified that it does or does not work?<br/>
<br/>
I have sent many messages and I thought the Placers were just <br/>
ignoring me. That appears to be a common misconception.  <br/>
<br/>
I have been surprised that I have not seen a reply regarding this <br/>
malfuctioning from the webmasters. I try to read all the posts but <br/>
hey I miss some now and then so maybe I missed a message about it. <br/>
Is it Wes who should be asked to look into why the function does not <br/>
work?  <br/>
<br/>
The website is so awesome - having the "contact the placer" function <br/>
work would really be icing on the cake.  However, if it does not <br/>
work and cannot be made to work perhaps the dead link should be <br/>
removed from the clues pages so that boxers don't waste time typing <br/>
out messages that are not going anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Since I cannot contact the placer - I will do a brief sitrep.  We <br/>
went to Loriell Park in Fredericksburg VA and found the Bent Trees <br/>
#1 &amp; #2.  Both in great shape.  They are in and around a frisbee <br/>
golf course which makes you want to take up that hobby too.  But it <br/>
would take away boxing time!  <br/>
<br/>
While in the park we found Martin the Warrior of the Redwall series.<br/>
A bit damp inside the box but the ziplocs were holding up well.  We <br/>
dried out the box.  Very nice stamp - love Redwall!<br/>

Not to slam anyone, since I don't know ASP programming or the reasons that<br/>
the 'Contact the Placer' function is not working over at the LBNa website,<br/>
however, the 'Contact the Maintainer' over that the PNWLb website is<br/>
working.  We've got a few boxes in the mix there and am looking for more to<br/>
be added soon.  The current poll has the states of California, Hawaii and<br/>
Nevada to be added to the site.  If I get enough requests for that, we'll do<br/>
it. This site is run by the folks that use it, so, make use of it!  (Grin)<br/>
