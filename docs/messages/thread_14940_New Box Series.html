Attention one and all!!! Pierce County Rescue as an emergency on their hands and they are overrun with calls, can you help?  Thunder Jack and Ted from the Disney Movie "Snow Dogs" have lost control of their vehicle while enroute to the Puyallup fair and they, along with their dogs, have become lost in the Bresemann Forest near the Sprinker Recreation Center.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are posted at the main LbNa site as well as at:<br/>

Okay so I sooo want these boxes!  You know that's it that's it I can't take<br/>
it anymore Kerjin! How could you do a Disney themed letterbox knowing how<br/>
hard it is for me to get out there and get them?  Oh I'm hurt totally hurt,<br/>
I can't take it anymore <whaaa wahh="" wahhha=""><br/>
<br/>
P.S. Just one a side note to Kris -- The only other person crazy enough to<br/>
letterbox in the dark when they can't see the nose in front of their face in<br/>
a dangerous area would be me! In case you don't remember Iron`Bear was<br/>
throughally pissed off with me back in May when I broke my ankle<br/>
letterboxing by hiking to the top of a waterfall base without enough time to<br/>
get down.  I probably would not have hurt myself in the daylight, but the<br/>
fact that I could not walk away without finding that box was as Iron`Bear<br/>
put it "Not the smartest thing to do".<br/>
