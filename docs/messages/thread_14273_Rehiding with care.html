                    <div class="plaintext-content">-  Melinda, you might not address it but I will. It is one thing to <br/>
have an animal get to a box. Upsetting, but acceptable. Not taking <br/>
the time to properly re-hide a box really P*&amp;^%# me off.<br/>
   Today Princess Turtle and I went on a box maintenance expedition. <br/>
How sad it was to find some of our boxes strewn amongst the woods. I <br/>
am almost certain it was due to improper lid closure and re-hiding <br/>
negligence. The containers we used had very tight lids so if properly <br/>
sealed they shouldn't have been in the sad condition we found them. <br/>
We always put a rock or stack of wood over the box to keep the box in <br/>
place. Luckily the stamps were fine, but PT's beautiful logbooks were <br/>
destroyed. <br/>

&gt; You know, I don't think enough can be said about the importance of <br/>
re-<br/>

&gt; obviously makes the box vulnerable to the mercy of just anyone <br/>
&gt; passing by.  And don't get me started on the problems caused by <br/>
those <br/>
&gt; who do not seal boxes properly....  I've been lucky; my boxes have, <br/>
&gt; for the most part, been well-hidden and re-sealed, but I've seen <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; beautiful, impecably done boxes almost trashed by a hasty re-<br/>
&gt; sealing.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We should treat the boxes we find with the same respect and care we <br/>
&gt; show those we place.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Reports of my letterboxes' demise are greatly exagerated.  None <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes are abandoned, missing, or otherwise defunct.  These <br/>
include: <br/>
&gt; &gt; Pigeon Point Lighthouse, Salmon Creek Falls, The Rock &amp; the <br/>
Heron, <br/>
&gt; &gt; The Critters of Ennisbrook series, Seven Falls, Stonehen, &amp; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; Arizona: Monsoon Madness &amp; Bassariscus astutus.  I also have a <br/>
new <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maine box which I look forward to posting if/when my membership <br/>
&gt; gets <br/>
&gt; &gt; confirmed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Another note about the Ennisbrook boxes.  I was told there had <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; &gt; speculation that they had been "trashed by geocachers".  Whomever <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; speculating could have just asked me, &amp; I would have put the <br/>
rumor <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; rest.  The only problem at Ennisbrook is that a pair of recent <br/>
&gt; &gt; visitors did a poor job of re-hiding them, &amp; they were sticking <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; &gt; like sore Rubbermaid.<br/>
