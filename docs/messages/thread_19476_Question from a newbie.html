Subject: [LbNA] Question from a newbie<br/>
<br/>
Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure this has been brought up before in the past but I just <br/>
wanted to throw my 2 cents in. For me letterboxing started out to be <br/>
all about the hiking. Being outside in the woods, where I have always <br/>
felt most comfortable. But then as I started collecting the stamps <br/>
and realized what true works of art some of them are, I started to <br/>
enjoy these as well. I'm fairly new to this hobby of stamp collecting <br/>
and only have found 27 so far. They all look great on the shelf over <br/>
the kitchen cabinets......but I'm running out of room. For those of <br/>
you who have collected 100+ stamps. Where do you keep them all? I'm <br/>
also having one heck of a time keeping the cats from batting them <br/>
around and have found some small chew marks in the rubber of a couple <br/>
of them. Do you build some kind of special cabinet just for the <br/>
stamps you have found? If I keep collecting at the rate I'm going at, <br/>
I'll run out of room in no time. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help<br/>

<br/>
What we do is paint them various colors with lead base paint and glue<br/>
on green glittery eyes if at all possible.  Then glue them on the<br/>
windows, adds a nice decorative touch I think.  I do agree the<br/>
handcarved ones are the best.  What do you do with the handmade<br/>
logbooks?  I like to take each page out, lay them side by side and<br/>
laminate them into placemats.....quite unique actually.  By the time<br/>
the holidays roll around we'll have enough to give everyone a complete<br/>
set plus a few extra for the dog.<br/>

<br/>
I'm sure this has been brought up before in the past but I just <br/>
wanted to throw my 2 cents in. For me letterboxing started out to be <br/>
all about the hiking. Being outside in the woods, where I have always <br/>
felt most comfortable. But then as I started collecting the stamps <br/>
and realized what true works of art some of them are, I started to <br/>
enjoy these as well. I'm fairly new to this hobby of stamp collecting <br/>
and only have found 27 so far. They all look great on the shelf over <br/>
the kitchen cabinets......but I'm running out of room. For those of <br/>
you who have collected 100+ stamps. Where do you keep them all? I'm <br/>
also having one heck of a time keeping the cats from batting them <br/>
around and have found some small chew marks in the rubber of a couple <br/>
of them. Do you build some kind of special cabinet just for the <br/>
stamps you have found? If I keep collecting at the rate I'm going at, <br/>
I'll run out of room in no time. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well Kevin, you have quite the dilemma there!  We're actually selling <br/>
our condo and upgrading to a larger house with more room to store our <br/>
stamps. The fun part is when you have multiple versions of one stamp! <br/>
Then you can compare the carving skills that the placer has developed <br/>
over the years! <br/>
<br/>
Our suggestion if you run out of room is to get a pet rodent. A <br/>
hampster may do, but chipmunks, squirrels and the like are truly <br/>
best. This way you can feed the stamp to your new found friend and <br/>
once it is finely gnawed, repeat the hike and place the stamp back in <br/>
the box!  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you get reeeeeaaalllly bored go to Petco and buy one of <br/>
those cat leashes. Strap it to your pet [rat, chipmunch, etc.] and <br/>
take your critter hiking!  Then he can also gnaw on the tupperware! <br/>
We hear is does wonders for keeping those teeth sharp and short... <br/>
mastercarve and PZKut are just to soft to actually whittle away that <br/>
tough calcium build up....<br/>
<br/>
-Steve , Heidi, and Madras <br/>
<br/>
Plus side of getting the rodent is really when it chokes on the <br/>
stamp, cuz then you can have a gathering to celebrate its entombment! <br/>

So that should solve my storage problem and I should be able to <br/>

I wasn't really sure what I was supposed to be doing with the <br/>
logbooks I have found. Scattering them about was great fun at first <br/>
but as with a lot of things this soon lost it's appeal. Perhaps I <br/>
