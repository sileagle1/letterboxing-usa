<br/>
When we created the series we did so with the point<br/>
being to locate the final stamp and log book.  <br/>
<br/>
The other two "clues" do include stamps, but no log<br/>
book.  We aren't interested in folks who tear off <br/>
paper and throw it in the first or 2nd clue containers.<br/>
That seems pointless and I'll pull that stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, I don't really care how many "boxes" one claims<br/>
but if it were me, I'd only claim a box if it contained <br/>
both a stamp AND a log book, as the intent would be clearly<br/>
to exchange stamps.  I think the FAQ implies that meaning for <br/>
a true letterbox.  I suppose I could have just put the 1st <br/>
stamp in a baggie, rather than a box, if that would help <br/>
prove the point better.  The second stamp stands on its own <br/>
and in no way could that ever be considered a box.<br/>
<br/>
In the long run, none of this really matters because letterboxing<br/>
is only a "game", with no true importance on the matters of <br/>
life.  If it ever comes to that, one should look long and hard<br/>
at what they are focusing on in life and readjust or "get a life"!<br/>
<br/>
Lets put this whole discussion to rest so the other seekers<br/>
can have fun too in their search for this box.<br/>

If you REALLY want to prove the point that they aren't letterboxes, <br/>
just don't include the stamps!  I felt if you really didn't want it <br/>
to count as a box, you'd simply write the clue on a piece of paper <br/>
and leave it in the box instead.  Then it would be absolutely <br/>
impossible to exchange stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
Look at it this way: What if you DID include a notebook, but some <br/>
twerp came by and ripped it off?  Does that mean anyone that comes <br/>
later would not be able to count the box as a found even though they <br/>
were able to exchange stamp images anyhow?  I think it should be <br/>
counted as a find, and those first two boxes really aren't much <br/>
different than the last one except for the missing logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
The FAQ on the letterboxing website states: "a letterbox can only <br/>
count as Found when the letterboxer obtains a stamp image from any <br/>
stamp associated with that box, and their personal stamp image has <br/>
been imprinted (or attempted) in the logbook or other part of the <br/>
box."  I've gotten a stamp image associated with the box, and I did <br/>
imprint my own signature stamp for the boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, you can officially count it as one box, but to me they look <br/>
like letterboxes, they act like letterboxes, and they feel like <br/>
letterboxes.  I've exchanged stamp images, and so I'm counting it as <br/>
three finds in my book.  If they aren't supposed to count as <br/>
letterboxes, don't leave stamps in them.  You can still leave a clue <br/>
behind written on a piece of paper, and that leaves no question about <br/>
whether to count the box as a find or not. (Not, in that case.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The second stamp stands on its own <br/>
&gt; and in no way could that ever be considered a box.<br/>
<br/>
Sure it can be considered a box!  Just a very creative one that <br/>
happens to have a logbook missing.  =)  You haven't seen the latest <br/>
model of "ultra-small" letterboxes coming out?  I've considered <br/>
making full-fledged boxes out of that same stuff in places where it <br/>
would be difficult to hide the larger, more normal-sized boxes.  <br/>
You'd have to hand-make a logbook to fit in it, but it can be done.  <br/>
No sweat!  =)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; In the long run, none of this really matters because letterboxing<br/>
&gt; is only a "game", with no true importance on the matters of <br/>
&gt; life.  <br/>
<br/>
That may be true, but a debate for the sake of debate's sake could be <br/>
a lot of fun in its own right.  I've been known to argue that the <br/>
world is flat.  Not that I really believe it, but it was a heck of a <br/>
lot of fun.  =)  In the LONG run, our pitiful lives have very little <br/>
significance on this little rock we live on--just ask the aliens <br/>
living in the next galaxy--but I still have fun letterboxing (and <br/>
debating!), even if it doesn't have any real significance.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Lets put this whole discussion to rest so the other seekers<br/>
&gt; can have fun too in their search for this box.<br/>
<br/>
This discussion shouldn't alter whether somebody has fun searching <br/>
for the box or not.  Half the fun of this box (I thought) was <br/>
debating whether to count the two "clues" as boxes!  And the stamp at <br/>
the end of the hunt is absolutely gorgeous.  Plus the hiding spot for <br/>
clue/box #2.  Very ingenious.  So not to worry, I'm sure anyone else <br/>
who comes looking for the box will have plenty of fun, regardless of <br/>
this discussion.  In fact, it might even bring out MORE people who <br/>
want to see the boxes in question.  =)<br/>

<br/>
I'm not sure why you seem so upset by this whole thread.  It wasn't <br/>
my intention to create ill-well towards anyone, and I had a great <br/>
time arguing with Amanda about whether those two "clue" boxes should <br/>
count as finds or not.<br/>
<br/>
You can point at ANY hobby and claim it's foolish or immature.  There <br/>
will be others who point at you or me and say how foolish and <br/>
immature we both are for chasing around the countryside for silly <br/>
little stamps.  Do you care what they think?  It's not really fair to <br/>
judge another's idea of fun based on our own perspective, though.  I <br/>
don't "get" gardening or needlepoint fanatics (or even Nancy Drew <br/>
fanatics for that matter--did you know there was a Nancy Drew <br/>
CONVENTION in San Fancsico recently?!), but I don't call those people <br/>
immature or foolish.  <br/>
<br/>
Arguing--just for argument's sake--can be fun and interesting.  <br/>
Trying to argue the world is flat is a mental challenge.  How do you <br/>
disprove the common "proofs" that the world is flat?  The textbook <br/>
example shows ships sailing in from the horizon, and the top of the <br/>
ship is visible first, thus, the world must be round?  What kind of <br/>
logic is that?  There COULD be other explainations for it, and the <br/>
mental challenge in thinking them up is lots of fun!  At least for <br/>
me.  I know not everyone shares that feeling, but it doesn't <br/>
automatically make the "hobby" foolish or immature.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; It is no one's place to dictate to others "how to" or "how <br/>
&gt; not to" orchestrate their method of sharing clues, what <br/>
&gt; to include in the box, carving stamps with or without location <br/>
&gt; names, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is doing that.  I think you're alluding to my Ace of Fun <br/>
comment as well as your own box, so I'll address both of them <br/>
separately.<br/>
<br/>
You can hide whatever boxes you want, however you want.  I'm not <br/>
suggesting you change your boxes in any way, shape, or form.  <br/>
However, whether you like it or not, the latest box you placed has <br/>
created a controversy about how to count it/them.  <br/>
<br/>
I suggested that putting in a piece of paper with the clue written on <br/>
it instead of a stamp would put the contraversy to rest.  If the <br/>
contraversy REALLY bothers you, YOU have the power to do something <br/>
about it.  Make it more clear the two clues aren't really letterboxes <br/>
by ditching the stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
I am NOT suggesting you do that, since it matters little to me.  <br/>
However, unless you change the boxes, the contraversy will never <br/>
die.  That's just a fact.  Plain and simple.  Some people (like <br/>
myself) will count anything with a stamp in a box as a letterbox--<br/>
whether a logbook is found or not.  Others won't.  There aren't any <br/>
hard and fast rules in this case, and if YOU want to end the <br/>
controversy, you WILL have to change the box by either removing the <br/>
stamp or adding a logbook.  I'm not trying to sway your decision in <br/>
any way, that's just a statement of fact.<br/>
<br/>
Now about the Ace of Fun box.  You were alluding to a comment I made <br/>
about the box when you wrote no one should dictate "carving stamps <br/>
with or without location names."<br/>
<br/>
First, constructive critisism never hurt anyone.  I've gotten it on <br/>
boxes I've hidden, and I'll probably get more in the future.  I <br/>
expect it, I like it, I consider the critisism, and whether I should <br/>
change any hiding habits in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Second, it is my opinion that a MYSTERY box should not have a stamp <br/>
that gives away its location.  I like showing off the stamps I've <br/>
collected to friends and fellow letterboxes, and if they see the <br/>
image it'll spoil the "hunt" for the mystery box if they haven't <br/>
found it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing Funhog like I do, I don't think that was her intention.  It's <br/>
the type of mistake *I* would have made while hiding a mystery box.  <br/>
At least until last month when such an event transpired with a <br/>
different mystery box.  It's also the type of mistake I think others <br/>
would inadvertantly make as well.<br/>
<br/>
If the hider of a mystery box doesn't care people don't have to <br/>
figure out the clue to find the box, that's OKAY!  Go ahead and print <br/>
the location of the box on the stamp.  But if that was the case, they <br/>
probably wouldn't have made it a mystery box in the first place.  <br/>
Kind of spoils it, don't you think?<br/>
<br/>
Whether anyone wants to put the location of their mystery box on the <br/>
stamp is their own perogative, but it should be a conscious decision, <br/>
not an inadvertant mistake which is what I think this is a case of.  <br/>
And if someone really wants lettering on their stamp without giving <br/>
away the location of the box, there's always the name of the stamp <br/>
that can be used.<br/>
<br/>
The warning about not putting the location of a mystery box on the <br/>
stamp is to warn others about this "loophole" in finding the location <br/>
of the box, and remind others who already knew about it.  If they <br/>
still choose to include it, I have nothing to say about it, nor will <br/>
I feel any guilt if someone accidently discovers the location by <br/>
looking through my logbook like has happened once before.<br/>
<br/>
But I wanted to make sure the location on the stamp was a conscious <br/>
decision, not an inadvertent mistake.  I'm not trying to dictate <br/>
anything.<br/>
