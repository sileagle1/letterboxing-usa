May 1 - 3, 2009<br/>
St. Thomas, Ontario<br/>
<br/>
Please join us for a day or two or three -- whichever works for you. We<br/>
promise to keep you entertained and letterboxing in some very beautiful<br/>
areas including Downtown St. Thomas, Old Talbot Street, Pinafore Park<br/>
and areas further afield.<br/>
<br/>
Tentative schedule of events:<br/>
<br/>
Friday<br/>
7 pm: Meet &amp; greet, getting settled, late night letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
Saturday<br/>
10 am: Registration at Pinafore Park, swaps, goodie bags, workshops,<br/>
letterboxing<br/>
1 pm: Pot luck lunch, group photo, door prizes, more letterboxing<br/>
7 pm: Supper and social at a local restaurant (location to be decided<br/>
when we see the number of people wishing to attend)<br/>
<br/>
Sunday:<br/>
11 am: letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
There will be three series of boxes planted. One will be in Pinafore<br/>
Park, One will be a historic walking tour or St. Thomas, One will be for<br/>
those of you who enjoy driving to picturesque locales in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Clue packages will be provided when your team registers.<br/>
<br/>
We would love some help with a few things:<br/>
1. someone interested in teaching a workshop of simple stamp carving<br/>
2. people interested in donating hand-carved stamps to be planted for<br/>
this event.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to plant letterboxes while you are visiting us, we<br/>
would be absolutely thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
We will provide more details as plans are finalized. You can keep<br/>
up-to-date by following our blog at http://bigblueteam.blogspot.com/<br/>
