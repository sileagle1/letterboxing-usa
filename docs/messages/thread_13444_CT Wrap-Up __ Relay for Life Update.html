                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow! What a busy weekend!!!<br/>
<br/>
Our apologies to those who could not find us... the opening <br/>
ceremonies at the Relay went a little long and when we got back we <br/>
had so many boxers at the RV that we did not make it to the grassy <br/>
island to pick up a few that were waiting. We're sorry about that and <br/>
If you made it to the relay and did not find us, email off list and <br/>
we'll make sure you get the event stamp. If anyone has a Relay coming <br/>
up and would like to borrow the stamp, let us know. It is headed to <br/>
Maine to Sealights but we can arange something!  <br/>
<br/>
That said, thanks to all who showed up Saturday to support us!  At <br/>
the risk of missing someone, we visited with Butterfly, Bluebird, <br/>
Music Woman, Team Green Dragon, Patrick and Amy, Wanda and Pete, <br/>
Letterboxer 2002, DragonHeart, Sealights, and Teach and Preach! Wow! <br/>
Also visits from Ghandi, Stalin, and Joe Shmoe the HH. Madras found <br/>
lots of love from everyone and rewarded them with some Mystery <br/>
Munchies!   <br/>
<br/>
Butterfly's clues to the Syt-u-ation at Walden Preserve were released <br/>
and are now available online, check the Salem, CT listings. Also I <br/>
mentioned a new series on new land trust property in Waterford that <br/>
is partially planted and will be released in a few weeks!  What a <br/>
great weekend!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We thank everyone for the support.... we walked about 15.6 miles and <br/>
Steve has blistered heels from wet sneakers!  Our team raised $3142 <br/>
and actually beat the WCTY/Country Radio team's totals, and they had <br/>
months of air time to push for donations! Thanks to everyone, <br/>
especially Butterfly for her encouragement and her hard work putting <br/>
out the Walden Boxes.  <br/>
