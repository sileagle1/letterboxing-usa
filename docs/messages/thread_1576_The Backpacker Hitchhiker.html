We found your hitchhiker today at the Lost Lake letterbox at<br/>
Westwoods.  We really liked the stamp.  Obviously you have a little<br/>
better carving ability than I do!  It looks like it was last found on<br/>
Oct 22 by Roller Girl and Biker Boy.<br/>
<br/>
We are trying to choose just the right place to keep it in<br/>
circulation.<br/>

<br/>
I'm glad that the backpacker was found!  The Westwoods <br/>
boxes hadn't been visited at all in the year they were <br/>
there, so I wondered if my stamp would have to spend the <br/>
winter there.  Sounds like she is in capable hands <br/>
though and well on her journey to letterboxing all <br/>
around the area.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, and enjoy the woods!<br/>
