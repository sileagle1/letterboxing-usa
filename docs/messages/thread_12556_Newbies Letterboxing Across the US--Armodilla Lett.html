                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday we found a box in Amarillo Texas called the "Armodilla Letterbox".  There was no contact info for A-Bear from Idaho who placed the box... it was in good condition, and we were the first to stamp in!  We had to wait for the kids from the school across the street to go in from lunch to avoid detection.  Crazy adult stalkers hanging around the park!  Scary!<br/>
<br/>
We've found several others on this trip (limited time--driving a U-Haul we have to get to So. Cal. by Sunday), mostly easy drive by's.  We sent e-mails to the owners of the others:<br/>
Gone Fishin' in Fort Smith, AR (we were first there too!), and the now busy GasNGo and PitStop (first find!) in Maryland.  <br/>
<br/>
So far we only have 6 stamps total, but we are really enjoying this new hobby, and can't wait to get home to spend more time hunting!<br/>

I'm so excited you found the Armadillo LB.  I wasn't sure if anyone <br/>
would make it to that one.  Thank you for the update.<br/>

Have a safe trip to CA.<br/>
