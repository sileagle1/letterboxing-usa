Tried to e-mail you at your aol.com address but my computer refused to "go <br/>
there.." do not know why that is..<br/>
Anyway, wanted to up date you on "Sherlock Dog". He has been a very busy <br/>
tourist of late.<br/>
After his first stop at "Point Mountain" in N.J. he was found by that boxes <br/>
parent and then came along with her and three other boxers on a journey to <br/>
"Bowman's Hill" in PA. After stamping in there I personally gave him a lift <br/>
to "Fisherman's Point" and "Into The Woods" in N.J., and then he made brief <br/>
stops at "South MT." and "Fools On The Hill" in Bethlehem PA.<br/>
Tomarrow it's back to N.J. and next weekend he is going up to Luzerne Co. <br/>
PA., he has made plans to rest after all that traveling at a water side <br/>
location somewhere in PA.<br/>
He'll e-mail home once he has arrived there.<br/>
He says "Hello!! Having fun ,wish you were here!!, will write soon.."<br/>
<br/>
                        You'd be proud of him!<br/>
<br/>
