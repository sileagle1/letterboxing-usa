letterbox "Last Day" and "The Circle of Life" series planted by Small <br/>
Bear. Successful on all accounts!  My first find was Last Day and I <br/>
saw a group of people ahead of me, on their way back to their <br/>
vehicle. I stamped in and saw RTRW, Bookworm (that stamp really stuck <br/>
in my mind as I'm also an avid reader)stamped in the same day!  As I <br/>
hunted down the Circle of Life clues I saw the same stamp-ins.  Did I <br/>
miss an exchange??<br/>
  Stamps were wonderful.  re. Last Day:  I get an A-plus and so do <br/>
you;-) re. <br/>
Circle of Life..ah, it took me a box or two to figure out this has to <br/>
do with a Disney series.  I had wondered about the topic when reading <br/>
the clues, then saw the cute stamps. <br/>
