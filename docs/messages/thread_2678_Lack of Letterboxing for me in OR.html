weren't able to make it to Ball Point.  It sounds like Ryan was a<br/>
diligent fellow and found ALL Tryon Creek State Park letterboxes,<br/>
including Wendy's!  Great job.  We're hoping to get out and do some<br/>
'boxing pretty soon.  Sounds like the Tacoma/Seattle area might need<br/>
some serious consideration!<br/>
<br/>
We could have done Mt. Tabor with the oldest grandkid, but with four of<br/>
them  there, (three being toddlers going in all directions) and too much<br/>
going on, It didn't seem too feasible.  John and I have got Mt. Tabor in<br/>
our books already and I'll take Stephanie up another day when it's just<br/>
the two of us and there's not so much other activity and mayhem<br/>
occurring.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, we'll get our F count up some more.  There are so many cool<br/>
letterboxes out this way now and it's time for us to find them!<br/>
<br/>
