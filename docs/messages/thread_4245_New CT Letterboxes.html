the railroad tracks that you are paralleling. Pass through a stonewall and 
follow the main trail up and over a hill. The trail will start to descend the

trail. Bear 340 degrees to follow the trail, crossing over a brook along the

degrees. From the corner of where the two walls meet, turn 210 degrees.
