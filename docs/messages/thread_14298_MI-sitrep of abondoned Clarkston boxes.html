<br/>
Went to Independence Oaks today to check on the five boxes that are currently undergoing the adoption process.  Here's what I found:<br/>
<br/>
(bear in mind, I've made this trek THREE TIMES and still haven't found all five)<br/>
<br/>
1) Independent Oak- <br/>
(new one for me.  Attempted twice before, only found with the help of Team Puppylover)  Alive and Kicking.  Showed it some love, gave new bags, and then had to carry it around with me for the next two hours because some wannabe intellectual was reading Faust or Goethe or whatever on the bench RIGHT BY THE SPOT.  No, I'm sure he was a really nice guy, just enjoying a really nice day, but it's very hard to be inconspicuous with a one year old in tow.  Thank God she doesn't talk yet.  *grin*<br/>
<br/>
2) 49 Habitat Trail-<br/>
(revisit)  Alive and Kicking.  New outer bags were given, some inner ones were provided, but this one was doing just fine without my help.  (At this point in the saga, that man was STILL AT THE BENCH, so I continued on with Independent Oak still in the bulging pouch of the umbrella stroller)<br/>
<br/>
3) This Place Rocks-<br/>
(revisit)  The park was at maximum capacity today.  In order to get to this box, I had to go through some company picnic- COMPLETE WITH KAROKE!  I'm not kidding you.  That was the funniest thing all day.  The saddest thing came when I got to the box.  This one was in utter disrepair.  Outer bags ripped, container cracked, logbook destroyed.  I gave it a new container, new bags, and a new logbook.  Stamp was still ok though.  This one will probably be the one needing the most upkeep, because of where it's hidden.  I'm sure that some visitor just slammed it back into the hiding place, not thinking about the delicate nature of the container.  Too bad, really, there were some nice stamps in the logbook.<br/>
<br/>
4) Dragonflies are Free-<br/>
At this point, Lotus was starting to do that "whine"d up.  Parents, you know what I mean- that, "If you don't end this torture soon I'm going to start screaming" pre-noise.  This was a new box for me, but the clues were easy enough to follow.  I zipped to the site, bribing the baby with unrestricted acess to her Nuk, saw where the box PROBABLY was, but couldn't find the box.  Now, there was a very nice family right next to me, so I didn't really want to go all Rambo on the area and conduct a full-on, obvious, search, but I think this one is MIA.  The family offered me B-B-Q, though.  Maybe they thought I was scavenging for food in the woods.  I'm a vegetarian, so I didn't eat any of  the BBQ, but their potato salad was very good.  <br/>
Short order, someone without a tired kid should go back on not-such-a-crowded-Sunday and really check.  I hope it's not missing, I still have this one to find.<br/>
<br/>
5) Ladies of the Lake-<br/>
Didn't even attempt.  There was a HUGE family reunion gathered at this site, PLUS the baby lost my compass somewhere on the trail (this is the second one she's lost).  I know it's a shoddy letterboxer who blames toddlers, but really.  TWO compasses?  <br/>
<br/>
At this point, I went back to the Independent Oak site, ready to come up with some EVENT Mr. Intellectual had to go witness so I could replant the box.  I had no idea what this EVENT was going to be, but still....luckily, he was gone by this time, so I put the box back, safe and sound, better hidden  than when I found it.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, I put Little-Miss-Sand-and-Sunscreen-Covered into her carseat and drove myself back home.  <br/>
Cheers, <br/>
Delirium<br/>
p.s.  Puppylover, sorry I didn't make it to the other two.  :)<br/>

<br/>
I so very much appreciate you going out and doing a maintenance run for me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; note to self: buy stock in compasses or tie several to the<br/>
stroller....<grin> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
I will try to get out to the other two in the next week, hopefully, during<br/>
the day there will be less people and such. These two are reasonably close<br/>
to parking so the huge pregnant lady won't have to waddle too far...LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your kindness!<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Sheila (team puppylover)<br/>
