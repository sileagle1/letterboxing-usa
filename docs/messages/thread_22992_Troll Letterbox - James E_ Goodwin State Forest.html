                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to state that I have givin the "Troll Letterbox" <br/>
located in Hampton Connecticut, James E. Goodwin State Forest, a <br/>
face-lift. It has become a mission to find the original owner and <br/>
inform him/her that the box was heavily damaged and has been <br/>
replaced. The logbook was heavily water damaged and sometime during <br/>
the winter, froze. When the logbook dries, I hope to find someone <br/>
who may remember the owner of the box. The beginning page in the <br/>
logbook does state that the "Troll Letterbox" was placed by, and the <br/>
names are missing and the stamped images are faded. The box and the <br/>
logbook does state that this box is indeed a letterbox, so when i <br/>
replaced everything but the stamp, only thing I could save, I did <br/>
make mention that the box had a face-lift and I will try to find the <br/>
original owner. I have saved everything I replaced and would like <br/>
for the original owner to have the items. Until then, I will keep <br/>
them safe from further damage. For anyone that did find the box, but <br/>
were unable to stamp the water logged logbook, the book is replaced, <br/>
stamped with the troll stamp and waiting to be stamped by others. I <br/>
did this in good nature and hope that what I did is exceptable by <br/>
others. If not, I'm sorry for being the good natured person I <br/>
thought I was being. Happy boxing to everyone and to all a great <br/>
time.<br/>

P.S. I plan on going to Desprately Seeking Sun Gathering in February <br/>
and Ice Cream Sunday Gathering in April. I Will bring all replaced <br/>
items to the gathering in hopes someone knows the owner and can <br/>
bring these items to the owner.<br/>

<br/>
That's awesome, David, and great letterboxing spirit. Have you <br/>
relocated Team NH to Connecticut?<br/>
<br/>
Unless I'm mistaken, that box is part of a really old Word of Mouth <br/>
series that was published on paper clues by some middle schoolers in <br/>
Winham. I may still have the clue sheet in a box somewhere and will <br/>
go rummage around this weekend to try and find them. I think I might <br/>
have sent them to Steve a couple of years ago, so I'll ask him too. <br/>
They were pretty cool, written in that wonderfully enthusiastic <br/>
junior high school prose. We never went looking for them but I <br/>
remember thinking "those must have been some exhausted kids!"<br/>
<br/>
If that's the box I'm thinking of, you won't get an owner claiming <br/>
the logbook. Show it off at gatherings if you'd like. Are there any <br/>
old sig stamps in there of people from the past?<br/>

traveled all the way to connecticut from new hampshire just to <br/>
repair a box. in fact, i have family in connecticut and i just so <br/>
happened to stumble onto the "troll letterbox" on day while looking <br/>
for some marching ants in the state park. I have been letterboxing <br/>
since August of 2005 and i'm hooked, i just might have to see a <br/>
pycholigist to fix this problem. (just kidding) I have made it a <br/>
mission of mine to keep the art of letterboxing known to only those <br/>
i feel i can trust. I got my father into it as well as my brother. i <br/>
myself have found 77 finds in only 5 months and look forward to <br/>
reaching 100 real soon. along my way i may find a box or two that <br/>
need some repairs, and i would do what any letterboxer, i hope, <br/>
would do to keep the art of letterboxing as stong as when it started <br/>
in the states. I thank those again for making me feel like i did <br/>
good, but i didn't do this for me, i did it for those in the future. <br/>
i love letterboxing in the beautiful state of new hampshire. i have <br/>
placed many boxes there so far and plan on placing many more. i hope <br/>
that if any one of my boxes becomes as damaged as the "troll <br/>
letterbox", they would do as i did. think about the future. <br/>
<br/>
thanks again and i hope to meet a lot of you real soon.<br/>
