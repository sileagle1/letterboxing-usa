Here are the revised clues for Sword in the Stone, Merlin's Grotto and 
a new one for Sir Gawaine.
<br/>Sword has changed location, Merlin is unchanged, but I've linked the
clues so this one set can <u>replace</u> the other two.
</p><p><b>Sleeping Giant State Park, Hamden, CT (New Haven County)</b>
<br/><b>The Camelot Series begins, by Bruce &amp; Aili</b>
</p><p>Merlin's Grotto
<br/>Merlin was already ancient, older than any man could possibly be, when
he sought his long rest in his cave. He had grown tired of serving so many
Kings, generation after generation. It was time they learned to do without
his sage advice, they hardly listened anyway.
</p><p>Follow the path of Gold. Be watchful for a path of Green merging from
the left. Follow this connecting trail. On this trail looking forward will
show you green, looking back will show you gold. It is a seldom-traveled
path though grassy vales. Nearing the end of the trail you will see the
cliffs ahead. Turn to the left on the green trail proper, counting off
13 healthy paces (two footfalls). Look up the rockface. See the place where
graffiti has been covered with dull brown paint. This is your destination.
Climb carefully mindful of the many holes between boulders.
</p><p>Upon reaching the crevice, which contains the cave opening, you will
see what appears to be a throne naturally formed in the rockface left of
the opening. There is a small flat place to stand next to it. From here,
notice the sumac tree at a bearing of 175 degrees. Merlin hides under rocks
at its base. Carefully replace the rocks so that they appear natural and
the box is well hidden (no peeking corners). The youth of the area sometimes
come to make patronage to the great wizard.
</p><p>The Sword in the Stone
<br/>Now let us move forward in time. The great isle was in turmoil. Civil
strife continued unabated in this beautiful, yet harsh land. Villages and
town faced continuous threats from the invading Saxons. Magic and monsters
roamed wildly through the hills and forests. From this troubled land, a
boy-warrior emerged from the mist and shadows, to unite his people, and
give back to them their pride and dignity. This was the boy who would be
king. This king was named Arthur.
<br/>Each year since the death of Uther a grand tournament was held near
the place where the sword waited silent and still. The winner of this tournament
gained the right to try and pull the sword from the stone. No one, no matter
their strength at arms, no matter the virtue in their hearts had been successful
yet. So for many years the land was without a King.  Then one year
Sir Ector traveled with his newly knighted son Sir Kay and his foster son,
Kay's squire, Arthur to the Abbey of the Sleeping Giant to attend the Grand
Tournament. All three were greatly excited. Sir Ector had not participated
in the tournament for some time and this would be Sir Kay's first. Young
Arthur was so excited he forgot Kay's sword, and did not remember until
shortly before Kay was to join the tournament. Sir Ector told Arthur to
hurry back to their lodgings and retrieve the sword. Arthur ran as fast
as he could but soon realized he had lost his way.  In a panic Arthur
looked around for someone who could help him. But he was alone. That was
when he noticed a sword sticking out of a stone. Without thinking he ran
to the sword and pulled it from the stone.  He then heard a voice
behind him and turned to find Kay staring at him. Arthur tried to hand
the sword to Kay, but Kay refused.  People began to gather around
them in silence. For a short time no one spoke, then from the crowd stepped
the wizard Merlin. Merlin said " Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon has drawn
the sword from the stone!" With that the crowd began yelling " Long live
King Arthur!!!", The sword is drawn, we have a King!". This is the tale
of how a boy became King.
</p><p>From the path below the enchanted cave, follow the Green east until
you see, to your left, a large boulder, so large in fact, it may look like
a cliff. Cross over the spring-fed stream and climb up the west side to
the grassy knoll on top. Put down your pack and face north to try your
hand at drawing the Sword from the Stone.
</p><p>Sir Gawaine, the Pure
<br/>Continue on your journey. Eventually you will come to the trail with
drops of blood upon it. Now follow this trail northerly. Your greatest
hazard could well be being attacked by swarms of pixies (the real kind,
mean, flesh eating, bloodthirsty, vengeful ones, not the cute little darlings
of Victorian fantasy). Defend yourself with smelly liquids applied to your
skin. It is the life-fluid of those who were ill prepared that marks this
path.
</p><p>From there, seek respite on the cool Path of Faith, heading toward the
Abbey. As you meander your way uphill, you will see a striking little cliff
face off to the right, a magical place, really, especially around Midsummer
when the roses bloom. Continue up until youre able to walk above this
pretty place, heading north directly off trail over rock and grass to a
rounded boulder on which to sit. At its base, Sir Gawaine awaits.
