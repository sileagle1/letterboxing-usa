                    <html><body>I'm convinced that Psychomommy wanted me to post first so that I can look like the completely insane one, but I'm dragging her down with me!  This was all her idea (although, I certainly didn't object!)<br/>
<br/>
Today in the pouring Maryland rain (finally!) Psychomommy and I went sludging through Greenbriar State Park and found The ADG's latest series.  We stopped in the visitor center to get a map and the woman we spoke to there said "who would want to go out hiking in this mess?"  "Um... we do..."<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to The ADG for being kind to us Marylander boxers.  We loved all the stamps.  We had quite a system going.  We had to hang Karin's umbrella from tree branches so we could get underneath it and stamp away.  I laughed out loud at the note in the first box!<br/>
<br/>
So, now I have gone boxing in complete darkness and pouring rain.  Now I just need a good snow storm.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Karin for the fun!  I had a great time.<br/>
<br/>
Hey ADG - Karin says that we can have a party when I find my 100th box...<br/>
Of course, at this point, I'll be partying in the insane asylum!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">--- I can't tell you how much I wanted to post yesterday. My server <br/>
was down. Every time it rains that seems to happen! <br/>
    I'm too old to care what others think, so looking for those boxes <br/>
in the pouring rain was just plain FUN! We had the whole park to <br/>
ourselves. I'm glad Firefly was game for this adventure. We were <br/>
slipping and sliding up and down the mtn. To us Easterners we call <br/>
them mountains. To you Westerners they are foothills. I liked the 2nd <br/>
box, TREATS. See it pays to get there early!  <br/>
   Regarding the french; I sort of blew it when I accidently sent it <br/>
without proofing it so the merci had an added e.  So those of you <br/>
that caught that mistake, take it as a BIG MERCI. Just so happy to be <br/>
alive that I want to learn what I screwed up in High School!<br/>
   I'm still waiting for that chance to rappel to a box! <br/>
   Tammy- I'm so old I can even waltz!<br/>
   Merci Coleen, Let's do it again!<br/>
