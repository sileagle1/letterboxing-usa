&gt;The Good Fairy Letterbox  , Friedman Forest<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rated easy  1 1/2 miles<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Planted: 5/6/01  By: Cock-A-Doodle_moo 4-H Club<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bebbington Rd. Ashford , Ct.  Windham County<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;From Mansfield Center take Rte 195 to Rte 89  Follow for several<br/>
&gt;miles until you come to a light. The river is on your right. At the<br/>
&gt;light turn right crossing the bridge then take an immediate left on<br/>
&gt;River Rd.  Proceed on River Rd. crossing into the town of Chaplin.<br/>
&gt;Follow to the stop sign and continue straight. After a yellow farm<br/>
&gt;house the Friedman Forest will be on your right. It is marked by a<br/>
&gt;brown wood Joshua's trust sign.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;From Rte 44 Ashford, at the junction of rte 89 turn onto 89 then take<br/>
&gt;an immediate left onto Slade Rd. See the signs for Crooke Orchard and<br/>
&gt;follow them.  At the stop sign turn right onto Bebbington Rd. Pass<br/>
&gt;the orchard the forest will be shortly after on the left.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;A Godd Fairy flitted  from place to place in search of some enchanted<br/>
&gt;woods seldom travelled and serene.  Her travels kept her from<br/>
&gt;settling down for a long time. To many people ,to much noise , many<br/>
&gt;parks were not enchanting enough.  When she came to Friedman Forest<br/>
&gt;she new it would be home. After leaving the car area where a few<br/>
&gt;passed the group entered a yellow blazed trail. The woods was green<br/>
&gt;and inviting. Signs of the mythical beast  Equus were on the trail.<br/>
&gt;It was good.    Crossing a small stream  the light danced on her<br/>
&gt;golden wings, water would mean many forest friends would live here.<br/>
&gt;Moments later they crossed a more substantial stream with a lovely<br/>
&gt;troll bridge and a pair of Mallards  circling in a pool above the<br/>
&gt;bridge.  They came to a place where a choice of trail needed to be<br/>
&gt;made. They went on the straight trail and AVOIDED the left turn.  Up<br/>
&gt;a grade and down the woodland scenery passed. They passed over a<br/>
&gt;tumbled wall. After about 3/4 of a mile it was cool in the filtered<br/>
&gt;light. Her wings were light and happy she flitted on. There was a<br/>
&gt;choice of a Colt or return trip.  She chose the return  trip  and<br/>
&gt;left the Colt for another day.  As the trail took a turn to run<br/>
&gt;Parrallel to an old wall she felt a certain sense of being home.  She<br/>
&gt;flew to where the wall ended and the trail began to drop off a steep<br/>
&gt;incline. There standing on a rock imbedded in the trail she took a<br/>
&gt;bearing of 60 degrees and procceded to that spot to settle down and<br/>
&gt;make a home. She new it would be only a matter of time before her<br/>
&gt;woodland friends began to visit. The sunlight and  birds bid her<br/>
&gt;welcome and she awaits. After visiting head down the slope  cross a<br/>
&gt;marshy space where the woodsprites play ,walk up and on , to  a<br/>
&gt;tremendous tree  a little more and  then return across the bridge to<br/>
&gt;the place in which you began.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Posted the good Fairy, we could not find the  Asford Oak will return<br/>
&gt;when have more time foe a more thorough look anyone else been there<br/>
&gt;lately? I am still scratching at last weeks poison ivy and hated to<br/>
&gt;poke about to much in the lush crop that was growing there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6 visitors have been to the new Bed Rug box which  will be nice for<br/>
&gt;my Mom to see ,the box was part of her birthday gift.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am now  p46f20x41e1   closing in on the 50 mark a considerable goal<br/>
&gt;in 9 months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone in the eastern Ct. area check out the Parent Planner newspaper<br/>
&gt;for a letterboxing article and quotes from me. It is a paper of<br/>
&gt;things to do with kids and they interviewed me several months back.<br/>
&gt;They even included clues to a first box the Queen of hearts, so we<br/>
&gt;will see even more local growth I hope.  I plan to send a copy to the<br/>
&gt;Drews maybe we can get it on the site.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Welcome to Bird house Lady and the 2 fat Cats glad to see you  got<br/>

&gt;Dan, Max and I found your three boxes at Lake Compounce yesterday (and<br/>
Jay's Thrill Ride too)!  What a great hike up along the stream.  It was<br/>
really beautiful!  We tried these boxes once in February, but the 3+ feet of<br/>
snow made it impossible to find any of the boxes.  On top of the fact that<br/>
we kept falling in up to our thighs!  Sunday was great though, we had a much<br/>
easier time minus the snow.  The views from the top are really spectacular!<br/>
Thanks for a great hike!<br/>

&gt;Below you will find the new clues for the replacement to York river SP #1,<br/>
Cardinals Rule...  I am still experiencing problems with FTPing my updated<br/>
web page files, so for everyone that has to rush out and bag this<br/>
replacement, I have included the text of the web page.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;P.S.   Squirrel......   Really loved your York River #2 stamp...   way<br/>
cool!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;York River (2)<br/>
&gt;York River State Park<br/>
&gt;Near Williamsburg, Virginia<br/>
&gt;James City County<br/>
&gt;Placed April 1, 2000<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Letterbox #1<br/>
&gt;Cardinals Rule<br/>
&gt;York River Park. Located near Williamsburg, Virginia. From Interstate 64<br/>
take the Croaker exit #231B. Go north on State Route 607 (Croaker Road) for<br/>
one mile. Take State Route 606 (Riverview Road) for 1.5 miles to park<br/>
entrance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Once you are in the park visit the Nature Center and get a map to the<br/>
Taskinas Creek Trail. Go the third overlook, Coire Maranzano Troup 135 Eagle<br/>
Scout Project. Look out onto the Taskinas Creek and look for Osprey that are<br/>
common to the area. Do an about-face and standing on the edge of the<br/>
platform, look past the right side of the closest Pine and note a large<br/>
double Beech tree (I think) up the hill at a bearing of 255. Go up the hill<br/>
on the left side of the Pine and you should find your reward on the back<br/>
side of the double tree. Continue on the trail back to the Park<br/>
Headquarters. Replaced 4 May, 2001 by the Jolly G-Man for Squirrel.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Channel Islands #1<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Santa Rosa letterbox.<br/>
&gt;This is the first letterbox planted on the channel islands. It was planted<br/>
&gt;on April 29, 2001.<br/>
&gt;Santa Rosa Island is in Ventura County.<br/>
&gt;There are different ways to get to each of the islands. This box is on<br/>
Santa<br/>
&gt;Rosa island. Probably the best way to get there is to fly<br/>
&gt;(http://flycia.com/). You can also get there by boat<br/>
&gt;(http://islandpackers.com/)<br/>
&gt;This particular letterbox is on a cliff overlooking the beaches under the<br/>
&gt;grove of Torrey Pines. (1 of the 2 place these trees grow in the world)<br/>
&gt;&gt;From the campsite, take the road east towards Skunk point.<br/>
&gt;About 1 mile from the campground, you will see the Torrey pines become<br/>
&gt;thicker, as you approach the end of the Torrey pine grove, where the pines<br/>
&gt;almost reach the road, you will see a pile of rocks (cairn), what you seek<br/>
&gt;is buried by these rocks.  If the tide is right, opposite the letterbox,<br/>
you<br/>
&gt;will see a blowhole.<br/>
&gt;Keep your eyes open for pinnipeds (seals &amp; sea lions) just beyond the surf<br/>
&gt;zone, there are tons around the islands. If you can make your way down to<br/>
&gt;the beach from here, there are some interesting grottoes to the west of the<br/>
&gt;box. Please take caution not to disturb the nesting Cormorants. Their eggs<br/>
&gt;are very fragile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The channel islands are a beautiful area that is rarely visited &amp; never<br/>
&gt;crowded. From kayaking &amp; hiking to animal watching, there are plenty of<br/>
&gt;things to do for all ages. Hopefully this will entice more people to enjoy<br/>
&gt;this unspoiled jewel of a national park.<br/>
&gt;have fun<br/>

&gt;Help! My sister and I were in Madison, CT this past weekend opening<br/>
&gt;up our cottage and decided we'd rather letterbox - her first<br/>
&gt;experience and my second! (Only 2 boxes in Ohio - I'll change that!)<br/>
&gt;Anyway, we have some questions (how frustrating it is to seek and not<br/>
&gt;find!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Westwoods trail: can you expand upon the clue: 'curiously balanced<br/>
&gt;shard of rock'. Man, talk about bushwacking!!! Is the box still there?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Found the Monument bx - yahoo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Dinosaurs before dark - is it still there? Directions were very<br/>
&gt;straightforward, yet we couldn't find it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) Thimble Island Box: again, couldn't find it, though the<br/>
&gt;description was great and we were sure we had the spot! It wasn't<br/>
&gt;located beyond those "No Trespassing - you'll be prosecuted' signs,<br/>
&gt;was it? We found a beautifully rounded outcropping, with a gorgeous<br/>
&gt;tree, wonderful root system - looked like the perfect spot, but no<br/>
&gt;box. Geezle!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, if anyone can help these novices... I"ll be up in July and<br/>
&gt;WILL find those boxes!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;please make the correction from I-95 to I-91 before posting our clues.<br/>
&gt;  Thanks also for your great praise of the "Trilobite" stamp.  It<br/>
&gt;turned out much larger than I had originally intended (just fits a 3 x<br/>
&gt;5 index card); it may be a problem for those of you with smaller<br/>
&gt;journals.  Have many more stamps carved - just need to get our act<br/>
&gt;together and plant them.  Thanks again for the feedback.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Posted the good Fairy, we could not find the  Asford Oak will return<br/>
&gt;&gt;when have more time foe a more thorough look anyone else been there<br/>
&gt;&gt;lately? I am still scratching at last weeks poison ivy and hated to<br/>
&gt;&gt;poke about to much in the lush crop that was growing there.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;6 visitors have been to the new Bed Rug box which  will be nice for<br/>
&gt;&gt;my Mom to see ,the box was part of her birthday gift.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I am now  p46f20x41e1   closing in on the 50 mark a considerable goal<br/>
&gt;&gt;in 9 months.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Anyone in the eastern Ct. area check out the Parent Planner newspaper<br/>
&gt;&gt;for a letterboxing article and quotes from me. It is a paper of<br/>
&gt;&gt;things to do with kids and they interviewed me several months back.<br/>
&gt;&gt;They even included clues to a first box the Queen of hearts, so we<br/>
&gt;&gt;will see even more local growth I hope.  I plan to send a copy to the<br/>
&gt;&gt;Drews maybe we can get it on the site.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Welcome to Bird house Lady and the 2 fat Cats glad to see you  got<br/>

&gt;If you were looking for the Thimble Island View Letterbox (check<br/>
&gt;http://www.ksdmsystems.com/letterboxing/ where I list the letterboxes I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt;found with a scan of the stamp).  I visited it on 4/19/2001, it was there<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Help! My sister and I were in Madison, CT this past weekend opening<br/>
&gt;up our cottage and decided we'd rather letterbox - her first<br/>
&gt;experience and my second! (Only 2 boxes in Ohio - I'll change that!)<br/>
&gt;Anyway, we have some questions (how frustrating it is to seek and not<br/>
&gt;find!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1) Westwoods trail: can you expand upon the clue: 'curiously balanced<br/>
&gt;shard of rock'. Man, talk about bushwacking!!! Is the box still there?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Found the Monument bx - yahoo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2) Dinosaurs before dark - is it still there? Directions were very<br/>
&gt;straightforward, yet we couldn't find it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3) Thimble Island Box: again, couldn't find it, though the<br/>
&gt;description was great and we were sure we had the spot! It wasn't<br/>
&gt;located beyond those "No Trespassing - you'll be prosecuted' signs,<br/>
&gt;was it? We found a beautifully rounded outcropping, with a gorgeous<br/>
&gt;tree, wonderful root system - looked like the perfect spot, but no<br/>
&gt;box. Geezle!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyway, if anyone can help these novices... I"ll be up in July and<br/>
&gt;WILL find those boxes!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I really hate to rain on anyone's parade, especially since Keith has<br/>
created<br/>
&gt;such a nice Webpage, but I feel it deserves to be pointed out that this is<br/>
&gt;probably not the best way to handle such matters.  In fact, it is most<br/>
likely<br/>
&gt;a blatent copyright violation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is my understanding that any hand-carved rubber stamp image technically<br/>
&gt;belongs to the maker of the stamp. Finding a letterbox does not give one<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;right to publish the stamp's image without first obtaining the express<br/>
&gt;permission of the original artist.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is up to the artist to decide whether or not to publish a stamp image...<br/>
&gt;and if they decide to allow it to be published, they should have exclusive<br/>
&gt;control over WHERE it is published.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I doubt that posting a general notice asking people to speak up if they<br/>
&gt;object to their image being used is really sufficient.  As an analogy, what<br/>
&gt;if I were to publish a notice in the LA Times asking authors to let me know<br/>
&gt;if they object to having me plagiarize their works?  I don't think I would<br/>
&gt;legally be able to get away with reprinting a Stephen King novel just<br/>
because<br/>
&gt;he failed to respond to my notice.  Whether it's a book, an oil painting,<br/>
or<br/>
&gt;a rubber stamp image, one must legally obtain specific permission from its<br/>
&gt;creator before re-publishing it in printed form or on a Webpage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'm not trying to single Keith out for a scolding... I just want to help<br/>
&gt;avoid future problems.  For the record, I would prefer that none of my<br/>
stamp<br/>
&gt;images be published anywhere besides my own Webspace.<br/>

already.<br/>

&gt;Der Mad Stamper has placed another letterbox in Portland, OR.  Located near<br/>
&gt;&gt;the world-famous Japanese Garden, I believe this is the first box in the<br/>
&gt;&gt;Washington Park area.  There is plenty of room for about a hundred more<br/>
&gt;&gt;boxes<br/>
&gt;&gt;in this park, but we've got to start somewhere...<br/>

&gt;Not to ruffle any feathers but...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I happen to agree with Randy. I feel a bit shakky about seeing stamp<br/>
&gt;images scanned onto finder's websites.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don't mind if authors do it, I am sure they would love to show off<br/>
&gt;their handywork. But I think it will sometimes spoil the surprise of a<br/>
&gt;good stamp if I see it before I offically find it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In fact there are a few stamps I have spent hours carving (especially the<br/>
&gt;?? ones) and I think it would be disappointing to see it displayed for the<br/>
&gt;world to see.  I would like to keep them mysteries as they were intended.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I however like the idea of keeping an online log of where I have<br/>
&gt;been, and just simply listing a table of dates and letterboxes should be<br/>
&gt;adequate enough for my tastes.<br/>

&gt;Thanks a bunch for a great day.  Today I snatched up Sneak Attack,<br/>
&gt;Panic/Attack, A "Mooving" Tail, and "Toe" Path.  They were all great<br/>
&gt;carvings and a lot of fun to hunt for.  It's great to have boxes a<br/>

&gt;What a fantastic job  these schools have done to coordinate this<br/>

&gt;Also wanted to mention that the Good Fairy box I planted this weekend<br/>
&gt;is what I consider my best effort at carving yet. I purposly chose a<br/>

&gt;I disagree, technically placed in the public they in the public domain.<br/>
&gt;That being said I believe that doing what is right is more important than<br/>
&gt;what is "legal".  I will not post the scans and will remove the ones I have<br/>
