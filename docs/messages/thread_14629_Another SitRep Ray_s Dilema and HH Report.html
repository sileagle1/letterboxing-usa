ago to swim its way to another home.  Today, we made it back to <br/>
Happiness at Hartman to get the new stamp there- AMAZING, by the way, <br/>
and what should we find but the Magic Lamp HH!  We took it with us, <br/>
but first gave it a rub and made a wish.  And it worked!!  A few <br/>
hours later we were finally able to find Ray's Dilema.  Apparently, <br/>
it's a good day for that box, for Music Woman and Steve &amp; Heidi also <br/>
found it today.  We have been trying to figure this one out forever!  <br/>
So all in all, a great day, and the Magic Lamp HH will continue its <br/>
journeys soon.<br/>
