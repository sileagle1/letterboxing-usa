Middlefield, MA (Hampshire County)<br/>
<br/>
Placed: Apr 16, 2004 by TehutiKa, AsetKa and kids! <br/>
Time and Distance: Doesn't really apply here<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
<br/>
Directions: From intersection of Routes 143 and 112 in<br/>
Worthington, take Route 143 west and follow for 4.2<br/>
mi. Turn left onto River Road (becomes East River<br/>
Road) and follow for 5.6 mi. Turn right onto Clark<br/>
Wright Road immediately after bridge and proceed .4<br/>
mi. to entrance and parking (7 cars) on right. There<br/>
are multiple ways to get here, but this is the<br/>
recommended way. Many of the roads in this area are in<br/>
rough shape, but this way is fairly good.<br/>
<br/>
Glendale Falls is one of the longest and most powerful<br/>
waterfall runs in Massachusetts. In spring, the waters<br/>
of Glendale Brook roar over steep rock ledges more<br/>
than 150 feet high before joining the Middle Branch of<br/>
the Westfield River. Even in the summer months, the<br/>
roar of the falls is a wonderous thing. This property<br/>
is maintained by the Trustees of the Reservations.<br/>
<br/>
In Egypt, before the dam was built, the Nile river was<br/>
divided up into distinct regions, bordered by<br/>
cataracts. A cataract is similar to the cascade that<br/>
is Glendale Falls, but much larger. We placed our<br/>
scarab here as these falls remind us of them, and the<br/>
scarab, a symbol of transformation, is oddly<br/>
appropriate for a waterfall that is never the same. It<br/>
is one of our favorite places to just sit. Hope you<br/>
like it, too.<br/>
