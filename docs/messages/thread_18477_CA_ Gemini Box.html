I'm so sorry you didn't get the box!! I was so thrilled when I saw the <br/>
subject line with "Gemini" in it because I haven't heard one word about the box <br/>
since I planted it last July. I know this area is not well traveled but, still, I <br/>
don't know if ANYONE has gotten it.  <br/>
<br/>
In rereading the clues, I don't' think I could have been any more exact in my <br/>
clues. It really wasn't cryptic at all. All I can add is that the box is on <br/>
the east side of the tree and probably, by this time, under quite a bit of <br/>
grass and leaves.<br/>
<br/>
If you venture up that way again, don't miss our St. Patrick series in the <br/>
Mendocino / Ft. Bragg area. It's the best!!<br/>

but good impressions. Sir B<br/>
