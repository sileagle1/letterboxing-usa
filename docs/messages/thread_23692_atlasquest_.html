Seems the hosting provider had some problems and needed to reinstall a<br/>
kernal, reboot the server a couple of times, and such.<br/>
<br/>
I just woke up this morning and everything seems to be working fine<br/>
now. =)<br/>

sure if it's related to the problem last night when the hosting<br/>
company had to do an emergency reboot or not, but I contacted them<br/>
about this issue and they replied with a fairly vague "There's a high<br/>
load on the node we're working on bringing down. Thanks for your<br/>
patience."<br/>
<br/>
So no, I'm not sure what's wrong, but they do claim to be working on<br/>
it! =)<br/>
<br/>
I guess it'll be up when it comes up. Your guess is as good as mine.<br/>
Sorry I can't be more helpful at the moment. =(<br/>
