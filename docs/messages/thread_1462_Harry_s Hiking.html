we've completed our Harry Potter series that began with Gryffindor <br/>
Tower ( http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/drewclan/tower.htm ). With the <br/>
schools, the village, and the Quidditch balls, there are a total of 9 <br/>
letterboxes to be discovered.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back from Gryffindor the other day we ran across a group <br/>
of three children noisily scampering along the trail above us. Soon <br/>
after their Mom, with a 4th Weasley-looking child, hiked up. Hoping <br/>
the kids would wait up, she was calling "Harry? HARRY!!!"<br/>
