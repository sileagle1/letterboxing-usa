I have been following the discussions with much interest but feel compelled to point something out.  It has been stated that once you release a letterbox you lose all right to it.  This is not the case.<br/>
<br/>
It is the policy of letterboxing.org and its webmasters that the originator of the letterbox, regardless of the type of box - traditional, traveller, parasite, etc, retains the intellectual property rights to all things associated to the letterbox.  Many placers waive their rights, especially in the case of hitchhikers, and let the finders treat them as they wish.  No one should assume, unless it is explicity stated otherwise, that they can assume those rights.  This includes the right to list a box on letterboxing.org without the originator's approval.  We have chosen to bend this policy slightly in the case orphaned boxes by allowing others to adopt them.  When doing so, however, we require the maintainer to credit the originator with the orginal placement, clues, etc. as appropriate.  That is our method of trying to maintain the intellectual property rights of others.<br/>
