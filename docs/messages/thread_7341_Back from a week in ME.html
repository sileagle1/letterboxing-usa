                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>After a lovely week of boating, fishing and swimming in Sebago Lake, Maine, we managed to get some boxing done as well.
<br/>
<br/>Rings in Heaven: Found the box while walking out, thinking we'd missed it. Unforunately, we also found some hornets that cut our boxing a little short. The box itself was in fine shape.
<br/>
<br/>Wolf Neck Woods #1 and #2: The first box is likely MIA. We found the second box right away, and everyone that stamped in for the last several months all said they hadn't found the first box, either. The second box is fine, though.
<br/>
<br/>Douglas Mountain: Great little hike, fantastic views on an exceptional clear day (all the way NW to Mt. Washington, and I think we spied Portland and the ocean down to the south), and our first stamp carved in wood. Everything perfect.
<br/>
<br/>We were going to go boxing on the way home through the seacoast of NH, but the hornet sting my wife got on her hand got very puffy and painful, so we cut it short and went right home. We'd also planned on placing two boxes, but those plans had to be shelved as well. So, now we've got two boxes, ready to go, and nowhere to put them. ::sigh:: Now I have to find somewhere in Western Mass for them instead. :-)
<br/>
