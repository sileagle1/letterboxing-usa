(http://www.geocities.com/trishkri/) and a place for all of our <br/>
clues.  Jay Drew has promised to change the links to their new home <br/>
shortly.  <br/>
<br/>
I found the border particularly amusing. Probably because I was too <br/>
lazy to find a better one and because I had to learn the leaves of <br/>
three rule the hard way when I moved here several years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy it.  Please let me know if you find any errors or <br/>
missing link.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Jay Drew, I decided to give Dinos its own page.<br/>
