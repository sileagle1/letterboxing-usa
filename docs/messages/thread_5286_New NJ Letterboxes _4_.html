<br/>
Be careful, as the path in the woods can get muddy and slippery in wet <br/>
weather. Also, watch your step as many small animals live in the area and <br/>
sometimes hide under piles of leaves; for their sake, watch your step!. Hik=<br/>
ers <br/>
and mountain bikers are also part of the local ecosystem; please be respect=<br/>
ful <br/>
of each other. If you feel adventurous, you may even want to go find the bo=<br/>
xes <br/>
on a mountain bike yourself, but watch out...going too fast may make you mi=<br/>
ss <br/>
a turn. Although every attempt has been made to place boxes in areas that <br/>
should not become overgrown, nature is often unpredictable; please let us <br/>
know if the boxes become unreachable.<br/>
<br/>
Park your car by the lake, at the bottom of the sleigh riding hill. Go over=<br/>
 the <br/>
hill, staying on the east side of the open field. You will find the entranc=<br/>
e into <br/>
the woods at the end of the field, towards the east. At the fork, go left; =<br/>
then, <br/>
at the T, go left again. What you are looking for is in a leaning hollowed-=<br/>
out <br/>
tree near where the iron horse jumps over the water.<br/>
<br/>
Go back to the T and follow the path you have not explored yet. At the next=<br/>
<br/>
intersection, take the path at 254. Cross the short and then the long brid=<br/>
ges. <br/>
Go up in the direction of the blue arrow and follow this larger path uphill=<br/>
<br/>
along the curve. At the T go at 248. From the big tree coming out of its s=<br/>
hell <br/>
at the top, go 14 paces at 268. Your treasure is hidden inside a branch.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the orange trail and at the next T go 260 towards the yellow <br/>
road. At the edge of the woods, you may find something useful, but not <br/>
necessary to continue. From this intersection of many paths, follow the blu=<br/>
e <br/>
arrow... but the watch out, the blue dots will lead you astray. Follow the =<br/>
blue <br/>
path across the bridge and along the river. At HJ2 by the brook, turn right=<br/>
 on <br/>
red. Hayden has been waiting there for you since June 17.<br/>
<br/>
After visiting with Hayden, go back on the blue path and stay on it, crossi=<br/>
ng <br/>
the creek and going along the Manalapan. At the road, turn right. As you re=<br/>
ach <br/>
the big clearing, leave the road and follow the edge of the woods at 100. =<br/>
<br/>
Almost at the corner, a small unmarked path on your right enters the woods.=<br/>
<br/>
Follow it for 15 paces. The final treasure is guarded by the fury snake at =<br/>
the <br/>
base of the Victory tree.<br/>
