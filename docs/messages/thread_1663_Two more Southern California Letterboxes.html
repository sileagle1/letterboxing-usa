 From the parking lot go thru the turn style. Take the right trail along the<br/>
 fence to the desert garden. Cross 2 wood bridges. When you come to a fork in<br/>
 the trail take the left trail.<br/>
<br/>
 Go thru Fay's Wildflower Meadow.<br/>
<br/>
 Take the path to the right as you leave Fay's.<br/>
<br/>
 At the T go left. At the next T go right. At the Y stay right. At the Palm<br/>
 Oasis go left onto the paved path.<br/>
<br/>
 Pass Lois' Bench and follow the road to a restricted area. Take the dirt path<br/>
 along the rail fence. Pass Cynthia's benches. <br/>
<br/>
 At the Y continue on the dirt path and stop at Edwards Bench. Sit and enjoy<br/>
 the sites. Stand and go left and then a quick right and then a quick left.<br/>
 Stop where another trail goes left up the hill. With your back to the largest<br/>
 rock on the right side of that trail look toward the pine 80 degrees to see a<br/>
 small rock under the lower branches of the pine. Walk toward that rock about<br/>
 7-8 steps and look under that rock and the needles for the letterbox.<br/>

 Mt. Baldy Ice Canyon Letterbox<br/>
 Mt.  Baldy Village, LA County, California<br/>
 December 23, 2000<br/>
 Placed by Squirrel and Brother<br/>
<br/>
 Park in the lot at the beginning of the Ice Canyon Trail and begin your<br/>
 search. It is a lot colder in this canyon so dress accordingly.  As you go up<br/>
 the trail you will pass two stone chimneys on the right.  Continue up the<br/>
 trail to a switch back where the Yucca Whipplei plant resides.  At the fallen<br/>
 giant take the less traveled trail to the right toward the stream. Pass the<br/>
 twin trees to a small clearing and find the Moon Gym tree. From there take<br/>
 the pipeline crossing.  Stop at the next twin trees and go 230 degrees to the<br/>
 Redwood with its arm pointing to the foundation.  The letterbox is cornered<br/>
 under leaves and rocks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Squirrel, you nutty little gal! Thank you for FLOODING me with <br/>
memories. When I was little we had a home in Claremont, and my job <br/>
was to pull the tumbleweeds out of the brick-hard ground so we could <br/>
try to get a "yard" going. I would bike several blocks over to the <br/>
Botanical Gardens and catch tadpoles in the pond. I used to ride my <br/>
bike up into the foothills of Mt Baldy then to enjoy a spanish-style <br/>
resturant and the stream out back. In those pre-smog days you could <br/>
look up from Mountain Avenue and actually see a mountain there. My <br/>
sister, brother, and their mother are still there: I'll have to write <br/>
them about letterboxing now.<br/>
<br/>
Love you for those!<br/>
Jay in CT<br/>
