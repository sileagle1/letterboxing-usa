                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I have already recieved positive feedback from the Mansfield Parks <br/>
director due to the letterboxing activity. He was most impressed with <br/>
the one stat I had at the time. From Sept5 to Presidents day in Feb <br/>
49 visitors stamped in at the Wolf Rock box here and that was through <br/>
a snowy winter ! I will get out there soon to update the count it is <br/>
my first box thus out there the longest and on a popular trail. I <br/>
expect the ones in and about Mansfield Hollow State Park will  <br/>
collect a sizeable following as well , that cluster and local make a <br/>
good daytrip.  The Friends of Mansfield Hollow ( support /activity <br/>
group) have been interested in the response to  letterboxing in the <br/>
park. I may do a workshop for them in the summer. Checking on who <br/>
stamped in is like seeing old friends! I'll post an update where <br/>
count is worth noting.   <br/>
