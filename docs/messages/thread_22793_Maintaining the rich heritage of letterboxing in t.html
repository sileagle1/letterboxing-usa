Or the more things change the more they stay the same.  I find it highly amusing to see that the list is maintaining its long history of highly-charged disagreements.  Look back over the many years of this list and you will see this and other similar arguments repeated over and over again since its inception.  <br/>
<br/>
As for letterboxing having no rules, IMO, it has several all having to do with respect.  The first one is respecting the rights of others.  That includes the rights of property owners, creativity of placers, and safety of finders.  The second is respect for others artistic endeavors which should include the responsibility of re-hiding boxes well.  The third is the right to respectfully disagree on how the game should be played.  As for the rest, everyone makes up their own rules anyway which is half the fun of the sport (couldn't figure out how to work respect into that one).  <br/>
<br/>
The most important thing to remember is that this list is not letterboxing and you shouldn't be foolish enough to mistake it for the real thing.  <br/>
