I think it would be great if we could all meet Ryan when he comes through <br/>
the mid Atlantic!  I hope that he keeps us updated so we can arrange <br/>
something!  I've heard rumors of a VA gather at the end of May.  I have no <br/>
idea how long it would take him to get this far from GA so that timing might <br/>
be totally ridiculous!...<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to reading more of his posts about his adventure.  It would <br/>
be great to meet him face to face.  Of course, that goes for all the <br/>
mid-Atlantic boxers too since BeMa has been consistently out of town for the <br/>
gathers and even the postal event :(<br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted!  BeMa<br/>
