                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mickey, there is an arm of the NPS devoted to locating Geocaches and<br/>
Letterboxes and removing them from our lands . If they can decipher clues<br/>
about a letterbox in the National Parks they will remove it and notify our<br/>
web site and the person that planted it as well . Supposedly they will<br/>
return the box to the owner(s) . We have that situation with four boxes on<br/>
the Calif. coast (Channel Islands ). Don<br/>

&gt; The National Park Service has had some bad experiences with hikers of<br/>
&gt; all types damaging any variety of protected plants, rocks, soils,<br/>
&gt; seashores, habitat, historical buildings, archeology - this is not a<br/>
&gt; new problem for them.  You must be ready to accept the consequences of<br/>
&gt; any actions you take or boxes you place.  A few years ago many people<br/>
&gt; were taken with the mystique of the Dartmoor secrecy regarding<br/>
&gt; letterbox locations however, LB is a recognized and acceptable<br/>
&gt; practice in England along with sheep grazing.  Different rules here.<br/>
&gt; I suggest you find places other than NPS areas and work to establish a<br/>
&gt; good track record for taking care of boxes and carefully selecting<br/>
&gt; their locations.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; State parks, conservation groups, town parks, "wild" land all hold<br/>
&gt; promise.  Many organbizations see LB as a way to lure more folks to<br/>
&gt; their venues.  Try to find some of them.  I do believe that after a<br/>
&gt; few more years of successful box maintenance, the NPS may change its<br/>
&gt; mind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Remember not to dig and look carefully at how a searcher could make<br/>
&gt; mistakes that would have them venturing into fragile areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
