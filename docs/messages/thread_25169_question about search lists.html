                    <div class="plaintext-content">I assume you are talking about the box listings on letterboxing.org.  If you<br/>
order the list by Location, I believe the boxes are listed alphabetically<br/>
first by county, then by city.  You can choose to sort by Placement Date<br/>
instead, then they will be listed with the most recently planted box first.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another option you might want to consider is exporting the list to a<br/>
spreadsheet.  If you do a "Search for Boxes" based on some criteria, you<br/>
should see a  "Export Box Info <http: boxdump.php="" letterboxing.org="">  -<br/>
export to Excel in .csv" option near the bottom of the page.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the webmasters might be able to provide more info on this.<br/>

I recently moved from Flagstaff to Tucson. We have been regular visitors<br/>
here for years and have done a fair amount of letterboxing already and plan<br/>
on doing more now that we are here full time.<br/>
<br/>
I like to keep track of the boxes I have found or attempted on a print-out<br/>
of the list of boxes for a given town or area. Now granted, this changes all<br/>
the time. BUT--I have never been able to figure out what order the list is<br/>
in or why it changes the way it does. It does not seem to be alphabetical by<br/>
placer or box name or chronological by placement date or.... Can anybody<br/>
give me a little insight here?<br/>
