                    <div class="plaintext-content">With all the recent discussion about clues I thought I would give my <br/>
2c about the GPS. Personally I like GPS clues and will probably <br/>
include them with all my boxes in the future. However, I will still <br/>
always use traditional clues when it is possible (landscape <br/>
permitting). That way people can go about it how ever they want.<br/>
<br/>
As a note on history, I believe that US letterboxing pioneered the <br/>
GPS hunt Long before geocaching even existed. I bet they would love <br/>
to hear that ;-) .  Way back in the beginning (several years ago) <br/>
there was much discussion about using GPS clues and I believe DanL <br/>
even offered to loan out a GPS unit to help folks in hiding boxes <br/>
using such clues. It has been a long time and my recollection may not <br/>
be exactly correct. If anyone cares, and I get inspired, I will <br/>
search the original talk list archive I have for the details.<br/>

I remember that.  I think he even loaned it out to some Texas letterboxers<br/>
at one point.  The first box I placed in Oregon includes GPS coordinates.<br/>
In those days, we were under the impression that letterbox clues should be<br/>
heavily dependant on compass readings.<br/>

I am glad you remember that! If you recall the date of you placed <br/>
that box I would really like to know. I am curious how many boxes did <br/>
have GPS coordinates back then. I will search my archives  and <br/>
attempt to document the first GPS letterbox clues we can prove. I <br/>
know it may sound perhaps petty, but I really think it is important <br/>
the the world knows that geocaching people were not the first to come <br/>
up with this idea. They just to removed the art of the concept and <br/>
replaced it with trinkets ;-)<br/>

...hmmm...  it was in '98, I recall.  I think late summer.  I'll have to<br/>
look for some kind of date.  I know it is written in the logbook of the<br/>
letterbox.  Unless Amanda gets up there, I'll check it next time I'm up in<br/>
the Coast Range.<br/>

Just an anecdote re: when GPS clues are very useful.  Several of my boxes <br/>
are planted along the N. Canadian River in Oklahoma.  One is really off the <br/>
beaten path.  In a river basin that runs through pretty flat, but heavily <br/>
wooded terrain there are very few useful terrain features.  By GPSing the <br/>
box coordinates, searchers can get in the right general area and then use <br/>
the specific local terrain features to zero in on the box.  Even with <br/>
selective availability turned off, under dense forest canopy or in a narrow <br/>
high sided valley GPS gets a person at best to within 6-20 meters.  A box <br/>
lying on the ground might be easily found at that range, but not one well <br/>
hidden.  GPS can be really useful for finding a remote box planted on bland <br/>
terrain, especially one not using trail following clues (start here, go to <br/>
here, then here, etc).  Letterboxing should be available to all, and <br/>
compasses are cheap and thus egalitarian, but I would regret seeing any <br/>
significant anti-technological bias to creep into the hobby.<br/>
