                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a great morning of letterboxing today, first setting out to find the <br/>
four Cedar Hill Cemetery boxes in Hartford (all were in good shape, however the <br/>
first box is kind of musty).  I then met up with True Soccer Fan and headed <br/>
out to find Spring has Sprung in Simsbury, which was also in good shape, however <br/>
the poison ivy out there was TERRIBLE!  Be careful!!!  We also found the Red <br/>
Handed Hitchhiker, recently "placed" by Sadie and Russ.  Now to mow lawn... <br/>
(ugh!  I'd rather be boxing any day!)  Hopefully, I'll get out to Valley Falls <br/>
later on this afternoon!<br/>
<br/>
oh btw.... I was out at the Simsbury Library this morning (I was stupid and <br/>
forgot the Spring has Sprung clues) and the CT site wasn't working once I got <br/>
to the place with the map, where you have to click on the county.  I had to <br/>
actually do a "search" for the box in order to be able to pull up the clues.<br/>

Happy Hunting!<br/>
