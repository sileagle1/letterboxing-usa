I wanted to post a large thank you to all of the people who gave me<br/>
referrals to letterboxes with plotlines.  I printed out over 30 of<br/>
them.  My father was officially discharged from the hospital yesterday<br/>
afternoon and you made his stay much easier.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
My mother is now using letterboxing as a carrot to get my father to<br/>
continue doing his leg exercises for his newly healed leg. "If you<br/>
want to go hiking thru the woods looking for letterboxes with your<br/>
son, you're going to have to continue doing your leg exercises to<br/>
build up your leg muscles." P-) P-) &lt;&lt; smiling pirates with eye-patches! <br/>
