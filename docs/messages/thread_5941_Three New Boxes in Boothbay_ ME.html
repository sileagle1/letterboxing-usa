Letterbox Location: Lincoln County, Maine<br/>
Nearest Town: Boothbay, ME<br/>
Planted By: Shipwright<br/>
Planted On: 26 June, 2002<br/>
<br/>
These are the first letterboxes that I have planted, and I have <br/>
chosen lovely Porter Preserve, on Barters Island, ME, as their <br/>
location. Porter Preserve is part of the Boothbay Region Land Trust, <br/>
a network of land and wildlife preserves throughout the Boothbay <br/>
Peninsula in Lincoln Country, Maine. Despite being located on an <br/>
island, the Preserve is easily accessed by automobile. Here are <br/>
the `official' directions to the Preserve, published by the Land <br/>
Trust trustees:<br/>
<br/>
"Travel north on Route 27; take a left at the monument in Boothbay <br/>
Center onto Corey Lane. Proceed 0.3 of a mile. Bear right at the fork <br/>
onto Barters Island Road and travel 2.2 miles crossing two bridges; <br/>
bear left on West Side road, then take a left on Kimballtown Road. <br/>
Proceed 0.5 of a mile and turn left at the fork onto a dirt road. The <br/>
Porter Preserve is 0.1 of a mile up the dirt road on the right. There <br/>
is a parking area on the right. Please do not block the road as it is <br/>
used by other property owners."<br/>
<br/>
And now for the Letterbox Clues:<br/>
	From the Map-Kiosk in the parking area, take the White Trail <br/>
going Northwest. You will come to a low wall of fieldstones. Follow <br/>
the wall due South, passing four tall trees sprouting barbed-wire <br/>
branches. The first Porter Preserve Letterbox is among the <br/>
fieldstones at the southern base of the fourth tree.<br/>
	Return to the White Trail and follow it going Northeast, <br/>
following it through a grove thick with white birches and past a <br/>
great uprooted tree on the left. You will come next to a large white <br/>
pine tree with spreading branches that bears the white blaze of the <br/>
trail  look for a white triangle painted upon the trunk of a nearby <br/>
oak. At 340 degrees from this oak there is a forked tree; the second <br/>
letterbox looks out at the water at this forked tree's base.<br/>
	Return to the White Trail, going South. You will come to an <br/>
oak tree that guards a four-way intersection of paths  go East, past <br/>
a bevy of ferns and an old granite water-well on the right. When you <br/>
come to a fork in the trails, follow the Blue Trail to the Southwest, <br/>
coming to a vista overlooking the water. At 120 degrees from the <br/>
granite boulder on which you stand, pick up the Blue Trail once more <br/>
and, where rock meet loam, seek a small woodpile through the trees at <br/>
160 degrees. The third letterbox is in the woodpile on the western <br/>
side, just below the topmost row of logs.<br/>
	From here, return to the White Trail and follow it through <br/>
the forest back to the parking area.<br/>
