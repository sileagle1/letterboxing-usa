2 Letterboxes, 3 miles<br/>
<br/>
Rating: Easy to find<br/>
<br/>
Semi-easy to walk (one large hill)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Location: From interstate 395 take Exit 93 turning onto route 101 West<br/>
toward Dayville and Pomfret. Go straight through the intersection of 101<br/>
and 169. Just after the junction of 44 is wolf Den Rd. Don't turn here,<br/>
but if you want, this is a campground. Continue up and down the hill,<br/>
(the road is now Rt. 44) on your left is the Main entrance for<br/>
Mashamoquet, don't turn here either, this is the swimming area. Up the<br/>
hill on the left is another campground. Keep going until you pass Pete's<br/>
ice cream drive-in. JUST past it (almost across the street) is a Road.<br/>
There's no sigh at this time. Turn down it and you'll go round a few<br/>
curves. When the road turns sharply to the right you'll notice a road<br/>
(dirt) joining it on the left. There's a red mark on the tree. If your<br/>
going<br/>
fast or not paying attention you'll miss it, however it's easier to see<br/>
if you miss it and turn around going back out. Take this dirt road.<br/>
After a little way there will be a dirt road on the right take this to a<br/>
parking lot, picnic area and outhouses.<br/>
<br/>
Yes this parking area is out in the middle of the woods, but it's the<br/>
only free parking area during<br/>
the summer season.<br/>
<br/>
After parking your vehicle, head at 290' back the way you came in. To<br/>
the blue trail. Turn 45'take<br/>
the blue trail at 10'.<br/>
<br/>
After a while watch for the log that makes a step.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the wash basin (could be muddy in the spring).<br/>
<br/>
The barbed wire field is at 300'. Descend down the hill away from the<br/>
field.<br/>
<br/>
Hop over the log on a rock. If it's muddy there's a pallet nearby to<br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
At the stump with the arrow that marks the way go 90'<br/>
<br/>
At the second marker continue. <br/>
<br/>
A bridge lies in wait. Cross it.<br/>
<br/>
At the T follow the trail to the park 330'<br/>
<br/>
You are now on the yellow trail.<br/>
<br/>
Go down the hill. Look for a bridge on your left. <br/>
<br/>
Walk to the bridge, but don't cross it. Instead go 100'<br/>
<br/>
The water you see and hear is Mashamoquet Brook.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Debbie, I updated your clues on the website, but I couldn't add your <br/>
email address. Egroups has a dumb-and-dumber antispam security thing <br/>
that keeps us from seeing each other's email addresses. Would you <br/>
mind spelling it out for me? Something like "drewclan at aol.com" <br/>
would do the trick. Great clues!!!<br/>
