Since that is my box, I guess I'll give the best answer. No, as far <br/>
as I know it is still there. If you go there I would STRONGLY SUGGEST <br/>
you take the short drive from there to Blackpoint Wildlife drive and <br/>
get that box also. This time of year there are often many tens of <br/>
thousands of migratory birds of all type to be seen at Blackpoint. It <br/>
is an amazing sight on a good day. That box is also intact as far as <br/>
I know and recently seen. The one I reported missing is near Sarasota <br/>
in Myakka park (the skyfish box).<br/>

Flapjack is missing from DeLeon Springs; however, there are new boxes in <br/>
DeLand and at Hontoon Island nearby.  These are in Central Florida.<br/>
