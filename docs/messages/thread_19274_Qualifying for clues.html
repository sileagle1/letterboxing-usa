<br/>
I'm not a big fan of those sorts of boxes myself, truth-be-told, but <br/>
I'm not bothered by the concept either.  There's a place for 'hard-to-<br/>
get' clues.  Requiring someone to find X number of boxes or place Y <br/>
number of boxes is just part of the hoops you have to jump through to <br/>
get the letterbox.  That's not a whole lot difference than my Walking <br/>
Tour boxes where they have to solve a mind-numbingly boring puzzle to <br/>
get the letterbox.  That's just part of the game.  =)<br/>
<br/>
Every box you find or plant gets you one step closer to the clue you <br/>
want.  It's like going after two boxes at once!  Once, with the <br/>
immediate gratification, and one with a delayed gratification.<br/>
<br/>
In that sense, it's more like a bonus box than anything new or <br/>
different.  Nobody get upset if you tell them they have to get ABC <br/>
box to find the clue for XYZ box--which is quite common.  Instead, <br/>
you'd be telling them, "Well, now you have to get ABC, BCD, CDE, DEF, <br/>
etc. boxes before you can have the clue."  It's more work, but not <br/>
really any different in the grand scheme of things.<br/>
<br/>
And some people like the change of pace or having a goal to reach.  <br/>
=)  Some people don't like those kind of boxes--which is fine, boxes <br/>
have intended audiences, which doesn't mean *everyone*--and those <br/>
people who are interested can go for it and those that don't, won't.<br/>
<br/>
No sleep lost either way.  JIMOH.  ;o)<br/>

Historic markers on the side of the road so often get ignored, and point the way to a neat thing of interest nearby.  Most town greens have gazebos (A tip of the hat to the wonderful CT Gazebo Series!).  And of course, the challenge of urban planting.  The harvest is plenty - the planters needn't be few.<br/>
    For the challenge of planting, consider the Qualifying for Clues to be not much more different than solving a code.  For some folks, that's darn-near impossible.  Diane and I have put more time into solving one particular code than we do planting!  When we *do* find this verschlugginer box, the work will be rewarded with satisfaction commensurate (sp?) with the effort.<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Re: Qualifying for clues<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Quite new to letterboxing here, but I'm eager to place boxes.  I <br/>
  think in many ways figuring out a great place to put a box and how to <br/>
  write clues in order to make finding the box a challenge but not <br/>
  impossible will be fun.  The challenge I'm having, however, is that <br/>
  living in New England, much of the area around me is already <br/>
  saturated with boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  I've thought of a seemingly countless number of places to put boxes <br/>
  where I grew up (in the Finger Lakes section of New York State) but <br/>
  the issue in placing boxes there is that they may be orphaned <br/>
  directly after placing.  I visit there from time to time (a few times <br/>
  a year) but wouldn't be overly interested in spending all my time <br/>
  there checking on the status of my boxes.  Perhaps I'll find <br/>
  another 'boxer who'll be willing to adopt them if I decide to place <br/>
  them there.<br/>
<br/>
  My point, though, is that for some the fun is in the find, not the <br/>
  place and even for those who like to place space is running out in <br/>
  some areas.  Thus, I'd have to voice my opinion to disagree with any <br/>
  method that requires a certain P count in order to get clues.<br/>
