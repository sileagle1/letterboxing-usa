reasons for each:<br/>
<br/>
Two series are geared toward children and I want to err to caution for their<br/>
safety, so that I know and control who has the clues.<br/>
<br/>
One box was in a highly sensitive area traffic-wise and I wanted to<br/>
reiterate to finders that they have to be cautious in searching and to<br/>
control the amount of traffic to the box.<br/>
<br/>
And this one is silly - As I was making the last cut on the stamp for one<br/>
box, I accidentally sliced the words off.  I had no more time to redo it and<br/>
I was far from home, and I had a specific purpose for the box, so I had no<br/>
choice but to go ahead and plant it.  To get the clues, you have to write me<br/>
and tell me what the words on the stamp are supposed to be, then I tell the<br/>
finder they will have to write those words in.<br/>

It's because some planters want to know who is looking for their boxes.<br/>
Sometimes this is because their boxes have been subject to vandalism when<br/>

Back before I did the freewebs site and put my clues there, I had to have<br/>
folks contact me for the clues to one of the boxes because the clues<br/>
involved finding the beginning site with a photo and then following the<br/>
trail using two more photos.  There didn't seem to be a way to put photos<br/>
directly on the LbNA clues page, so I just put instructions for folks to<br/>
contact me for the clues and then I emailed the clues to them.<br/>
<br/>
I have two boxes that are located near a labyrinth in Wheaton and I wrote<br/>
out the clues inside the frame of a labyrinth so that folks have to keep<br/>
turning the paper to read the clues, sort of how a person has to walk a<br/>
labyrinth in a circular way.  There's no way I would've really been able to<br/>
post that one on LbNA either.<br/>
