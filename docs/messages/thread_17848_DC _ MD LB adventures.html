continues...<br/>
<br/>
o  Cherry Blossoms alive &amp; well, survived the hurricane with little <br/>
damage--it was a bit damp but the logbook was high &amp; dry!!!<br/>
<br/>
o  Mr Jefferson's Micro alive but needing some maintenance (logbook <br/>
was drenched--I let it air dry as best as I could but it needs some <br/>
major TLC such as a few days in the sun)--this is one of my favorite <br/>
LBs &amp; I was ecstatic that it was still in place--the small tree <br/>
referenced in the clues has been chopped down but the letterbox was <br/>
still alive under debris beneath the remnants of the former tree--I <br/>
added a new plastic bag to it but it still needs to be aired out for <br/>
a LONG while...<br/>
<br/>
o  Mr Taft's Memorial LB was missing (it's hiding spot has obviously <br/>
been somebody's home for quite some time--not sure that it would have <br/>
lasted very long there--it was cloaked with a blanket &amp; a sweater <br/>
when we found the spot)<br/>
<br/>
o  George Washington in Bethesda, MD was alive &amp; well with a couple <br/>
dozen visitors!!!  So many boxers were active this winter--what a <br/>
surprise!<br/>
<br/>
o  Lily of the Valley in Bethesda, MD was alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
o Stone Arch in Bethesda, MD was also alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
o  Not sure if we mentioned that Skull &amp; Bones LB in DC was missing <br/>
during our visit to it yesterday  <br/>
<br/>
Yet another glorious sunny but brisk day in the capital!  These <br/>
letterboxes were simply exquisite treasures to find--we really <br/>
enjoyed each &amp; every one we found along the way today.  So many more <br/>
choices for area letterboxes, so little time left...  :(<br/>
