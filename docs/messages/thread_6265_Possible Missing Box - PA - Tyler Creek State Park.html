US Air and have been loving it since! To all the webmasters and <br/>
box placers - thank you! Keep up the great work!<br/>
<br/>
On a slightly sadder note, we struck out finding a box for the <br/>
first time this weekend and we think it might be missing! We were<br/>
hunting the Water's Edge box in the Tyler Creek State Park series<br/>
planted by Muk-Luk. We got to the spot where the letterbox really<br/>
looked like it should have been, but no luck! We hunted everywhere<br/>
near by that we thought it might be, but to no avail. If the <br/>
box's owner wants to contact me off board at <br/>
travelintiger@h...,<br/>
to see if we were just in the wrong spot, feel free. Or if someone<br/>
has actually found it recently, please correct me.<br/>
<br/>
Keep on hunting!<br/>

     WE also had trouble finding Water's Edge, and i heard from Wanda <br/>
&amp; Pete who been there a bit ago that they as well beleive it may be <br/>
missing.<br/>
But Muk-Luk's other Tyler boxes were found doing great<br/>
Check them out, great hikes!  And keep your eyes open for deer!<br/>
hope that was some help.<br/>
