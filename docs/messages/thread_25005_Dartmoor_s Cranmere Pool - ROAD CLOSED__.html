Snopes is given way too much credence, particularly if you do some <br/>

I'm sure that there may be differences of opinions on the use of <br/>
wikipedia as well as snopes, but my only point is use more sources and <br/>
don't consider that snopes is the ultimate answer.<br/>

Even if an e-petition makes no difference to the Duchy of Cornwall or <br/>

As stated in my post regarding online petitions they do have value, <br/>
but while closure of this road is opposed by many in the UK, my guess <br/>
is that there are those in the UK that do not oppose road closure. I <br/>
believe that many folks can disagree on the topic and still consider <br/>
themselves letterboxers whether that be in the UK or the US.<br/>

golden years, fear they will no longer be able to return to their old <br/>

When we're young and healthy, it's easy to say, "make them work for <br/>

opinion, so I will shut up now. Thanks to those who've listened.<br/>

I thought your response was very good - and I think it is important for us<br/>
to give a little loyalty back to those who originated our hobby.  In my<br/>
opinion, letterboxing is a game that constantly evolves and changes as new<br/>
members come in and other members leave, and it is easy to forget those who<br/>
came before us as the game changes.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the poll has credence or not with the Whoever Matters, the fact that<br/>
we show solidarity with those who were a building block between the origins<br/>
of letterboxing and today is a good thing, and I appreciate you bringing it<br/>
to the forefront.<br/>

an open mind, but you obviously have opened it further.  I have been <br/>
boxing for 2 years and do not just do drive bys.  I am 69 years old and <br/>
have walked several miles to get to a box.  Got poison ivy for the <br/>
first time in my life last year, got lost in a marsh after dark with <br/>
the coyotes yelping all around me and all the other things we all <br/>
experience looking for boxes.  I am certainly not a seasoned boxer like <br/>
some, but I do consider myself somewhat experienced.  I have never been <br/>
to Dartmoor and will never get there, but I do respect the choice of <br/>
those who have been and our founding fathers.  I have tried to do my <br/>
reasearch, but do not know much about those who gave us this wonderful <br/>
hobby (addiction).  If someone is willing to give me info on them or <br/>
tell me where I can find the info I would welcome it.  I didn't mean <br/>
for my comment to become a big subject of conversation.  I will truly <br/>
do my research before I make any more comments.--- In letterbox-<br/>

The folks behind snopes are human and can and do make mistakes.<br/>

Not having been to Dartmoor is no reason to stay out of the <br/>

of 69 you should keep on putting your two cents in. Wisdom doesn't come <br/>
early. <br/>

You should consider plugging in a trip to Dartmoor as it is a fantastic <br/>

out boxes and withdrew all of them.  I am sorry for that as I met her <br/>

niece.  They were all very cryptic and you had to do research and <br/>
puzzles to find the stamps.  It helped to keep my brain working as <br/>

put a lot of work into them.--- In letterbox-<br/>

Keep in mind that this "history" some refer to<br/>
generally means the "post Smithsonian" era, which<br/>
means +04/98.  There is, of course, "history" in<br/>
American letterboxing before then.<br/>
<br/>
This has the effect of making alot of "first this/<br/>
first that" wrong.  Moreover, there are other<br/>
inaccuracies here and there.  Since this list<br/>
doesn't go back to 04/98, you have to find the<br/>
personal e-mail records of the people who where there<br/>
to sort it all out.  Etiquette prevents posting these<br/>
on the web, otherwise it would be kinda cool.<br/>
<br/>
So, like most things, this "history" is in the eye<br/>
of the beholder, and, as in all history, subject to<br/>
revision (unintentional and intentional) by various<br/>
commentators over the years.<br/>
<br/>
That said, it was my impression that the original<br/>
comment on history and founding (*)thers was querying<br/>
information on non-Americans.<br/>

want to<br/>

Unfortunately, I think it's entirely possible to letterbox in the present<br/>
without knowing the past - in the same sense that you can read Shakespeare<br/>
in Cliff Notes without sitting through the play.<br/>
<br/>
The game is so much richer when you know its roots!<br/>
