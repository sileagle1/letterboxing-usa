It is a mystery box called Frodo's Dream, with clues worked around <br/>
themes from Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It might look daunting <br/>
at first, but I don't think it's that tough - maybe three stars on <br/>
Randy's scale. <br/>
<br/>
It can be accessed at<br/>
<br/>
http://www.sover.net/~tcooch/frodo.htm<br/>
<br/>
and from our LbNA map, after Mitch adds it to the ? list.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
What an intriguing set of clues, Tom...<br/>
Frodo's Dream has been added to our growing list of letterboxes with <br/>
mysterious locations, as have Todd's Oak Tree Letterbox and Randy's Alphabet <br/>
Soup Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I'm finally getting caught up with most of my after-vacation chores, now.  <br/>
The website is looking great.  Up here in the Northwest, I've added links to <br/>
Greg &amp; Ginny's recent Mt. St. Helens boxes, and Cara's Mt. Neahkahnie. (Nice <br/>
stamp image, Cara. Thanks for sharing!)<br/>
<br/>
Down in California, we now have Todd's Mugu Peak Letterboxes, and the two <br/>
Presido boxes that John planted while in Frisco.<br/>
<br/>
Looking to the East, Todd scored again in New Jersey, with his Weiss Ecology <br/>
Center Letterbox at Norvin Green State Forest.  Meanwhile, Marty has managed <br/>
to maneuver Michigan onto the Map.  Mmmmm...<br/>
<br/>
Deborah's created Much Ado About Nothing somewhere in Wisconsin, and Randy <br/>
has more letterboxes in Valley Forge, PA than my cat has fleas!!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know how Tom has managed to keep up with the New York / New England <br/>
area so well!!!  Things are just going mad up there!!  Keep up the good work, <br/>
Tom.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think I'll ever keep up with Diedra.  She's definetely got a bad case <br/>
of the 'Madness'...  Oh well, bring on the clues, girl, I'm ready!!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Clues to my new Nebraska letterbox can be found at:<br/>
http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/cornhusk.htm<br/>
<br/>
All seven of my Kansas letterboxes show up on the map at:<br/>
http://members.aol.com/letterboxr/usa/nwkslake.htm<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I've forgotten anybody.  Now... where should I plant the next <br/>
Oregon letterbox?  Hmmm...<br/>

Thanks, Jay. I enjoyed doing this one a lot. Nobody has told me yet <br/>
the location is obvious, but I feel sure someone out there is already <br/>
zeroing in.<br/>
