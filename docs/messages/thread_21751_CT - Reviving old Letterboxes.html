As long as there's no objection, I'd like to bring some Letterbox <br/>
clues out of the dark and dusty "basement of unclaimed Letterboxes"<br/>
to <br/>
allow more folks to visit and enjoy them.  This would mean that I <br/>
would become caretaker of them since the whereabouts of their owners <br/>
is unknown.  My name would become the "contact placer", but full <br/>
credit still goes to the original placers.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes that I'm referring to are:<br/>
 - "The Alchemy Letterbox Series-Mercury" by Cobalt Nine in New<br/>
Haven, <br/>
CT.<br/>
 - "Lewis and Clark in CT" (3 boxes) by Winternuts, in Woodbridge, CT.<br/>
<br/>
I found all 4 boxes intact and dry, but they haven't been visited in <br/>
about a year since the clues aren't readily available.<br/>
It would be a shame not to share these older gems with everyone. <br/>
...happy 'boxing...<br/>
