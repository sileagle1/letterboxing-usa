                    <div class="plaintext-content">Visited this box while on vacation on 6/25.  Journal was in good <br/>
condition.  Stamp and ink pad were wet so put them in a new dry bag.  <br/>
What a great stamp.  Was glad to have been able to locate since I <br/>
live in Ashford, CT and this box was planted by a local letterboxer <br/>
(Leader of the Pack).  <br/>
<br/>
Amish country is one of my favorite places to visit.  Was going to do <br/>
the "Bridges of Lancaster" but a nasty case of poison ivy left me <br/>
sitting quietly in the 90 degree heat.  Will catch that one next time <br/>
and hopefully some more will be planted bu then as well.<br/>
