Land of the Wild Goose Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Location: Near Sligo, NC, Currituck County<br/>
Placement date: July 21, 2001<br/>
Placed By: Kayaking Friends (and one of the Buds)<br/>
Special Considerations: Only accessible by kayak or canoe. Allow at least 2<br/>
hours. Be careful about re-hiding the box so that it is not visible from the<br/>
main creek.<br/>
Supplies needed: Compass and maybe a topo map<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
In the county named for Land of the Wild Goose,<br/>
There is a letterbox not on the loose.<br/>
It is waiting for kayakers or canoeists to see<br/>
Hidden inside a many-kneed tree.<br/>
It requires a trip on rivers of three,<br/>
Not hard to find, but difficult to see.<br/>
<br/>
On a road that rhymes with joiners<br/>
Youll find the put-in. Here are your pointers:<br/>
Not too far from Route 168,<br/>
Put in in time before its too late.<br/>
Follow creek one until it ends,<br/>
Turn north on creek two, Tulls, which bends.<br/>
Follow this creek until a T appears,<br/>
Tulls takes a turn just about here.<br/>
You paddle straight, not into Tulls Bay.<br/>
On creek number three, Rolands the way.<br/>
<br/>
Now on Roland Creek count the curves,<br/>
The first is gentle around homes it swerves.<br/>
Take no hard lefts, youll go astray.<br/>
Follow the main creek; the homes go away.<br/>
<br/>
The creek begins to look so wild,<br/>
Three curves more as you paddle a while.<br/>
The fourth curve is the biggest youll see.<br/>
This ones important to you and me.<br/>
Look to your right at the end of the curve.<br/>
See the remains of a sailboat with verve.<br/>
<br/>
Whod sail up into the tiny creeklet?<br/>
Did their boat crash and they simply left it?<br/>
This white derelict is an important clue.<br/>
Go into the creeklet, a letterbox is due you.<br/>
On the opposite side of the creeklet from the boat<br/>
Is the letterbox placed so that it wont float.<br/>
On that side youll see an odd tree.<br/>
Look into the place with many a knee.<br/>
Is it five trees that grow from one bunch?<br/>
You are there, its not a hunch.<br/>
<br/>
Youll have to get out to stand and look<br/>
Down in from the top is the box and the book.<br/>
Stamp in, hide carefully, enjoy the day.<br/>
You made it; paddle back; you know the way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hint: If this proves difficult or the old boat is missing look for latitude<br/>
36 28.967, longitude 76 6.723 and youll be very close. If problems with<br/>
this letterbox, contact lillie@wildriveroutfitters.com.<br/>
