                    <div class="plaintext-content">Heard about Letterboxes a few months ago - the more I read,<br/>
the more interesting it becomes.  Unfortunately, there don't<br/>
appear to be any boxes in this area (north of Baltimore) and <br/>
traveling to the nearest boxes isn't an option right now (more<br/>
on this in a sec).<br/>
<br/>
So -  I'm guessing that if I want local boxes I guess I should<br/>
get busy and hope it catches on here, right?<br/>
<br/>
A few questions about placing boxes that I haven't seen covered:<br/>
(I did check the archives - honest!)<br/>
<br/>
If you're going to place a box in a local/state/nat'l park - should<br/>
you talk to to someone in the parks office to make sure they don't<br/>
have a problem with letterboxing  or should you just sneak it in<br/>
and hope for the best?   (or am I misinterpreting "public"?) <br/>
<br/>
The best walking trails in the area are all in parks some of which<br/>
ask for an entry fee.  Will people look for a particular box if<br/>
there's a park fee involved or will they most likely skip it?<br/>
<br/>
I don't really have a hiking buddy at the moment and<br/>
I'm not going to head out in the woods alone to place<br/>
OR find boxes - so any suggestions about where to start<br/>
finding someone to hike/walk/place/find with?<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

Yep, that's a good way to start.<br/>

<br/>
I gotta give you credit, seeing the volume of mail this list <br/>
produces. It took me over two weeks to skim though the archives when <br/>
I joined, and that was a lot of posts ago.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It depends on the attitudes of the people in charge. In CT, the <br/>
Forest &amp; Park Association supports letterboxing because they feel <br/>
that it brings more people out to enjoy their trails. More people <br/>
enjoying trails means more people to sympathize with conservation <br/>
efforts, which is what they're about bottom line. I've read that some <br/>
Nat'l Parks see us as habitat-damaging litterbugs though.  Generally, <br/>
I think boxes are "sneaked" and we hope for the best.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; ask for an entry fee.  Will people look for a particular box if<br/>
&gt; there's a park fee involved or will they most likely skip it?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't discourage me. I feel that entrance fees support the <br/>
parks, even if money doesn't end up theirs directly.<br/>
You may want to mention that there is a fee in your clues, however, <br/>
so that Lb hunters can be prepared.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don't really have a hiking buddy at the moment and<br/>
&gt; I'm not going to head out in the woods alone to place<br/>
&gt; OR find boxes - so any suggestions about where to start<br/>

<br/>
Try the Rec departments of your town and neighboring towns for <br/>
walking/hiking/orienteering groups, or just start talking about <br/>
letterboxing in any social situation. You never know who will also <br/>
find it interesting and want to accompany you. I discovered 'boxing <br/>
at a Girl Scout meeting (Thanks Annie!).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

I admit - I cheated and used the search function  took a few days<br/>

I will certainly do that  - <br/>

I'm looking into the local volksmarching organization - but<br/>
I'll also try  the local rec and see what happens.<br/>

thanks to everyone who replied on and off list  - you've<br/>
all been a big help<br/>
