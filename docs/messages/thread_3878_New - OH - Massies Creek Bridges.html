Difficulty: 1 (Drive-up)<br/>
Near Xenia, Greene County, OH<br/>
Placed 4 Dec 2001 by Flyfisher (geoflyfisher@yahoo.com)<br/>
<br/>
Just a couple miles north of Xenia Ohio on Route 68 lies a small <br/>
crossroads now called Old Town.  Here the story starts, for it was on <br/>
these cornfields in the last half of the 18th century that the <br/>
Shawnee Nation founded its capital.  Home of great orators who <br/>
riveted the Indian nations against the encroaching white man, this <br/>
now sleepy town was the center of civilized Native American activity <br/>
in the Ohio Territory.  <br/>
<br/>
Old Chillicothe (Old Town) had farms, cabins, politics, love affairs, <br/>
sickness and military conflict.  The legendary warrior Tecumseh was <br/>
born here in 1768. In 1778, a captured Simon Kenton was condemned to <br/>
9 gauntlet runs by the nation because of his actions against the <br/>
Shawnee.  The first three gauntlet runs were run here that year when <br/>
Tecumseh was 10 years old.  The next year, Col John Bowman's Kentucky <br/>
Troopers were defeated on these grounds by Chief Blackfish and forced <br/>
to retreat to Ft. Washington (Cincinnati)<br/>
<br/>
In 1797, a frontiersman and revolutionary war soldier, James Galloway <br/>
moved his family just south  at the site of present day Xenia.  <br/>
Relations with the large town of Chillicothe were reasonably <br/>
peaceful.  A 29-year-old Tecumseh was taught to read by a Galloway <br/>
daughter named Rebecca and the two reportedly fell in love.  <br/>
<br/>
Over the next 50 years, the Indian capital was abandoned, Tecumseh <br/>
led a rising by the united Indian nations and was killed in battle <br/>
many years after he and Rebecca left each others arms  each <br/>
unwilling to enter the other's world.  The township around Xenia grew <br/>
with the introduction of rail lines.  Farms sprang up in the valleys <br/>
around Xenia, and roads were built to connect the farms and allow <br/>
transport of the produce to Xenia for shipment.  <br/>
<br/>
Wilberforce, just north of Xenia on US 42, came into prominence in <br/>
the mid 19th century as the site of the first institution of higher <br/>
education owned and operated by African Americans  a joint <br/>
enterprise of the Methodist Episcopal and African Methodist Episcopal <br/>
churches.  The school (later college and now university) was named <br/>
after the 18th century English statesman and reformer, William <br/>
Wilberforce in 1856.<br/>
<br/>
A contemporary history put it thus: "It was in one of the darkest <br/>
periods of the Nation's history, when the Cincinnati Conference of <br/>
the Methodist Episcopal Church, moved by the inspiration of Christian <br/>
philanthropy, appointed a committee of seven to consider and report a <br/>
plan for the improvement of the intellectual and moral condition of <br/>
the thirty thousand colored people of Ohio, and those of other free <br/>
States, by furnishing them such facilities of education as had been <br/>
generally beyond their reach. This period was that intervening the <br/>
passage of the Fugitive Slave Bill and the breaking out of the civil <br/>
war. The demon of slavery had reached the zenith of its power, and <br/>
was preparing for its deadly struggle with the genius of liberty."<br/>
In the east is Wilberforce; at the west is Old Town.  Connecting <br/>
them, a creek flows from Wilberforce to Old Town.  Massies Creek <br/>
meanders across this northern part of Greene County, and across it <br/>
two 19th century covered bridges still carry traffic on the country <br/>
lanes.  Visiting these two bridges in their wooded valleys is the <br/>
purpose of your quest today.  <br/>
<br/>
If you begin in Xenia and go north on Route 68 you will be within a <br/>
stone's throw of James Galloway's house  still standing these many <br/>
years later on Church Street.  Entering Old Town, you can stop at the <br/>
roadside marker and read the story of Simon Kenton's gauntlet runs.   <br/>
Look for Brush Row Road in Old Town.  It takes you east and up out of <br/>
the valley that was old Chillicothe.  Across about a mile of <br/>
cornfields you will come to a stop sign on Stephenson Road.  <br/>
<br/>
Turn Left (north) on Stephenson and tap your brakes to make sure they <br/>
are working well.  Just ahead the road begins a steep descent to the <br/>
covered bridge.  A beautiful valley and setting is marred by an auto <br/>
junk lot just across the bridge.  (I hope you have already learned <br/>
that nothing is perfect.)  So stop on the near side of the bridge at <br/>
a turn off on the left side of the road.  Take a few pictures and <br/>
enjoy Massies Creek as it burbles under the bridge.  <br/>
<br/>
Start with your compass at the red and white yield sign by the <br/>
bridge.  At a heading of 240 degrees and 10 paces away (1 pace = 2 <br/>
steps or about 5 feet) is a small yellow square on a post.  From this <br/>
post, at 160 degrees and 15 paces, next to Massies Creek and at the <br/>
base of a large tree, under a medium sized rock, is the first <br/>
letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
After stamping up and getting back in the car, go across the bridge <br/>
(whee!) and turn right onto Jones Road.  Follow this up the hill and <br/>
around a number of bends, past the Stephenson Cemetery, and arriving <br/>
at Wilberforce-Clifton Road.  <br/>
<br/>
Turn left onto W-C road and within a quarter mile, turn right onto <br/>
Charlton Mill Road.  A half-mile later, pull off the road (left is a <br/>
little easier) just before the second covered bridge of your trip.  <br/>
It is worth a walk through this bridge that has mostly escaped the <br/>
spray paint cans of vandals.  On the far side, a grassy area makes a <br/>
good place for shooting a few snapshots of one of the landmarks built <br/>
in the middle part of the 19th century.   I took a few pictures from <br/>
the center of the creek with my waders in early December.  I saw no <br/>
fish, just rocks, but it was still nice to wade the stream.  <br/>
<br/>
Walking back toward your parking, from the mouth of NW end of the <br/>
bridge, at 330 degrees and 7 paces, looking right you will see a rock <br/>
lying next to the rock wall.  Under that rock is the letterbox you <br/>
seek.  <br/>
<br/>
After stamping up, drive through this bridge as well (whee!) and <br/>
follow Charlton Mill Road to it's termination on US 42.  A right turn <br/>
will take you through Wilberforce, the home of both Wilberforce <br/>
University and Central State University.  A few miles later you will <br/>
have returned to Xenia.  <br/>
<br/>
Spend a moment with a friend in the next week and tell them what you <br/>
learned when you pondered the ancient conflicts between races <br/>
represented in this triangle of Xenia  Old Town  Wilberforce.  <br/>
Racism (and tolerance) here began with the Shawnee and the "white <br/>
men" Simon Kenton and later James Galloway.  Racism and tolerance <br/>
also existed between black and white in the need for and founding of <br/>
Wilberforce.  Perhaps in this new century, we can get by without <br/>
inventing a new racism and continue to learn to work with each other <br/>
as people.  It's up to us.<br/>
