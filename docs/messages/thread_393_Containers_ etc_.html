<br/>
I realized a long time ago that the hardest part about getting<br/>
started is getting assistance and getting your questions answered.<br/>
As good as our help and FAQ's on the Web page are, a good solution<br/>
to work along with those is to have good communication and to know<br/>
who to talk to to get information.  I think that realization was the<br/>
impetus behind making the left-hand map so prominent on the page.<br/>
<br/>
I've also realized in my hunt for the perfect container and the<br/>
perfect log book that there are no such things (at least not that<br/>
are readily available in the market place).  However, I have not<br/>
given up on finding a good variety of items (and ways of procuring<br/>
those items) that will help to ease the process of getting started.<br/>
And if we do decide on some configuration for items as "ideals", I<br/>
can always order them custom made.  I've found that 144 is the magic<br/>
number for ordering custom manufactured goods.  If there were about<br/>
say, 30 of us, interested in something, we could order 5 each and<br/>
get a good price.  That's about how it would work until more people<br/>
get involved.  I'd be willing to mail things out.  I bought a scale<br/>
for that purpose (to keep postage at a minimum).<br/>
<br/>
In the mean time, I just want to encourage you to keep talking and<br/>
discussing ways that you would like me (and each other) to help.<br/>
I believe Graham said an ideal container would have a square body<br/>
(about 4") and have a screw on lid (for good sealing) and should<br/>
be able to contain post cards and some of the extras that people<br/>
like to put in there.  Deborah found some colored plastic jars<br/>
with a "clamp-type" lid.  Does this have a steal ring on it<br/>
Deborah?  Just wondering if it would rust...<br/>
<br/>
The log books I have<br/>
looked into can be special ordered to any dimension, however, the<br/>
coating may intefere with some water-based inks.  Therefore, its<br/>
safe to say that a more universal type of paper would be better<br/>
for those who want to accomodate every type of ink.  A well sealing<br/>
container to protect the log book is a good measure too - perhaps<br/>
better than water-proof paper.<br/>
<br/>
It has occurred to me that several<br/>
container/logbook options would be good and that's where I think we<br/>
will end up in the recommendations we make to others as they get<br/>
started.  But we can help to determine what sizes, etc. are ideal<br/>
so we can offer a selection that fits most, if not all, people's<br/>
needs.  I mean whatever we recommend, we don't want it to be an<br/>
odd size that doesn't work or a type of container that does not<br/>
seal, etc...<br/>
<br/>
There should probably be a small container for a special purpose:<br/>
<br/>
I've wondered if someone may want to put out a stamp in a very small<br/>
container by itself, with no log book.  Its a must, I know, for some<br/>
people to collect images.  But its conceivable to me that someone may<br/>
just want to provide images for others to collect and would not<br/>
necessarily be concerned about collecting images.  If a person is<br/>
in a contest to collect images, of course a log book is a must for<br/>
them. But the other way to collect them (if our neigbors ever get<br/>
started) is to go out and hunt for them.  Anyway, a small container<br/>
is all that would be needed if you only put out a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Keep talking everyone.  So far, for me, the most interesting concept<br/>
has been the letterbook.  There is one for sure by Tom Cooch in<br/>
Vermont at http://www.pclink.com/elf/randolph.htm#kimball <br/>
The only idea that was more or less panned that I can remember<br/>
was the cyberbox.  The cyberbox would have had no stamp, just a code<br/>
which you could use to get the stamp image.  But I'm sure there are<br/>
more ideas that have not been explored yet that could make the<br/>
hobby more interesting and that may help to compensate for our<br/>
unusually large neigborhood.  So don't be afraid to share your<br/>
ideas.  I'll bet most of the best ones are still out there.<br/>

I HAVE seen some that fit this description. The ones I have are clear (sort <br/>
of cloudy-looking) flexible plastic, with a red screw-on top.  The mouth is <br/>
probably about 2 - 3 inched across. They are obviously made for liquids, as <br/>
they are equipped with a detachable straw that is connected inside to the <br/>
little flip-top.  These are about 5 - 6 inches deep. I can;t tell you the <br/>
brand name, as they are at home, and I am not (until Monday). But I got them <br/>
at a grocery store.  Wonder how THESE might do??<br/>

<br/>
My Split Rock stamp was almost 3 inches across.  I think the<br/>
opening of an "ideal" container shoud probably have at least<br/>
one dimension of 3 inches +.  Don't you think?  But I'm sure<br/>
the one you're talking about would work well for most stamps.<br/>
Then again, there is more than one "ideal" container I think.<br/>

&gt;  &gt;  Deborah?  Just wondering if it would rust...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Sorry, I forgot to reply to this!<br/>
&gt;  Yes, it does have a metal closure, so I'm sure it would<br/>
&gt;  eventually rust. Oh well... it was already out of the<br/>
&gt;  running for perfect container since it's not an ideal size,<br/>
&gt;  but the colors make it "stylin' "!!!  Would you like to trade one<br/>
&gt;  of my tutti-frutti ones for one of your Scientific/Surplus ones?<br/>
<br/>
Yep, sure.  In fact I have about 15 of the tall narrow ones and about<br/>
65 of the short squat ones left.  Which one do you want or do you want<br/>
one of each?  I'll take one of the tutti-frutti ones (any color).<br/>
