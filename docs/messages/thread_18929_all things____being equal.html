communication savy of Phyto. <br/>
 She has friends and supporters who have defended that "maybe" the <br/>
hostility or flames were unintended..or she was simply being frank <br/>
and clear spoken.  but they do her a huge injustice. <br/>
 She's a smart girl...and an effective communicator. <br/>
What was achieved, was clearly intended. <br/>
No Doubt.<br/>
Tolerance takes patience, skill, practice, and a desire to exercise <br/>
it.  Since it comes not from over there....maybe we should work on <br/>
our own a little more??   peace people.<br/>
