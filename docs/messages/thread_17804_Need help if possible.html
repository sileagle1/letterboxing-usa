                    <div class="plaintext-content">We are heading down to Virginia this weekend.  We are leaving early Friday morning and was wondering if there was any letterboxes at rest stops along I95 from Ct. to Vir.  We are traveling with 3 kids and I know will be needing to make some stops along the way and I would like to do some boxes at rest stops.  I also hope we get to meet some Virginia letterboxers while we are there.  We'll be going to Norfolk to visit my niece for the weekend.  Thank you for any help.
