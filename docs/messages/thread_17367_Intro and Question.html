Welcome ! Gwen and I use a backpack and keep our book in a separate Ziploc,stamp pads and coloring pens go into another Ziploc. We have another Ziploc for our stamps. Various extra supplies of blank log books,Ziplocs,Tupperware,pencils are usually tossed into the bottom of the back pack. When we find a letterbox we "set up our store". FYI there are now two California chat lists in case you have something that would be of interest to the Left Coasters only. They are Letterboxing Northern California and Letterboxing Socal. I don't have the exact addresses in front of me but someone will probably jump in on this thread and supply them.<br/>
