For the traditionalists out there, here's some info on the history <br/>
of letterboxing that may interest you:<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing in the US history can be found here:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/message/1293<br/>
<br/>
Rules to follow while letterboxing can be found here:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/rules/<br/>
<br/>
What's vitally important to note here is the Leave No Trace (LNT) <br/>
ethic!<br/>
<br/>
Some history about letterboxing in Dartmoor and its tradition of <br/>
using stamps that incorporate custom artwork (generally with a stamp <br/>
that suggests the location of the spot in which it is hidden):<br/>

Thanks dvn2rckr !!!<br/>
I remember reading the original posts when we first joined(there was <br/>
not as many to go through then), and really appreciate your <br/>
reposting them. It would serve the hobby well if everyone would read <br/>
them again, or for the new folks read them for the first time. When <br/>
ever some thread tends to get a little heated, just consider what <br/>
the letterboxing pioneers went through to set this hobby up here in <br/>
the New World. Sometimes there were problems, but letterboxing <br/>
survived, and is now flourishing.<br/>
