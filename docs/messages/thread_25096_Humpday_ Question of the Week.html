                    <div class="plaintext-content">Way back when (98?) I read the letterboxing article in Smithsonian Magazine &amp; was amazed by the whole concept...but I never contemplated it being in the U.S. Then in 2004 one of my sister's friends (in MA) took her on her first hunt, she then told me about it &amp; the urge to participate took hold. My husband &amp; I got online, joined LbNA &amp; learned that there were several boxes in nearby Ennisbrook woods (So.CA). On our first try we didn't find the first box..."Salmon Rushdie" but we did locate two others, amongst them "Emma the Grey Squirrel"&amp; we were just so thrilled with the whole idea of clues, hand carved stamps, &amp; the thought of secret boxes all around where we hiked &amp; strolled on a daily basis that we immediately bought lots of carving supplies &amp; went to town setting up our own series of letterboxes. So - a HUGE thank you from us to Ron Golden, who carved &amp; hid the Critters of Ennisbrook series &amp; who most graciously lets us try &amp; keep the boxes<br/>
 intact in his absence. And another huge thank you to all thesweet wonderful folks who we have met via email since we began this letterboxing adventure.<br/>
