<br/>
     It gives me great pleasure to announce that the<br/>
Purloined PZ Kut Caper has been solved. Before the<br/>
winner is announced there are a few acknowledgments in<br/>
order. <br/>
<br/>
     Many thanks to the victim, suspects and culprit<br/>
in this mystery who participated on faith, not knowing<br/>
who was asking them to join in, nor what their role<br/>
would be. I appreciate their involvement, entertaining<br/>
banter and good sportsmanship. My hat is off to Der<br/>
Mad Stamper, Don &amp; Gwen, Stealthboxxer, Green Tortuga,<br/>
Poison Ivy, Sewsowbizzy, BarefootLucy, SpringChick,<br/>
TeamGreenDragon and Mark &amp; Sue. Without their willing<br/>
participation this little suspense for your enjoyment<br/>
would not have been possible. <br/>
<br/>
    Congratulations to RaqsEnigma whose perseverance<br/>
and many long hours has paid off in fingering none<br/>
other than Mark Pepe as the culprit. While many have<br/>
submitted guesses and logical deductions it is<br/>
RaqsEnigma who broke the code and submitted the<br/>
correct answer...... Mark Share.  Conclusion is......<br/>
Mark stole the PZKut to share. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>

I know I very rarely post, so the vast majority of you have no idea <br/>

thing for the fun mystery and for giving me something to tear my hair <br/>
out over.  I'm still quite flabbergasted.  There are so many <br/>
incredible decipherers in this hobby, I'm more than a little <br/>
overwhelmed that I'm the one who figured it out.<br/>
<br/>
And Mark, now that you've been outed - what's the deal?  Are you <br/>
giving DMS back his stash, or what?  Please, give it back!  If there <br/>
was any one catalyst pushing me forward to find an answer, it's that <br/>
I could no longer withstand his contant wheezing and whining and <br/>
wimpering!  I just can't listen to it any more!  <br/>

     It is my pleasure to announce that "The Case of<br/>
the Missing Store of Good Manners" is solved. <br/>
Congratulations go to Gary, a new boxer, who has<br/>
exhibited patience, persistence, and many skills in<br/>
the solving of this case. <br/>
<br/>
    The solution:<br/>
<br/>
We are all guilty. <br/>
"Unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot,<br/>
nothing is going to get better, it's not."<br/>
<br/>
     The clues to the actual letterbox will be posted<br/>
in the near future. Thank you once again, to all those<br/>
who played the game. The accused individuals were<br/>
those who set excellent examples of the etiquette<br/>
needed for the convivial survival of letterboxing. One<br/>
would do well to heed their advice.  <br/>
<br/>
     Truly, <br/>
<br/>

Thanks, donutz716, and uneksia.  I considered sending a post to the <br/>
two "yawners",,, it appears like maybe they're leading a boring <br/>
life.  Maybe they'd like the challenge of solving that mystery,,, <br/>
that would take away their boredom.  ;-)  I wasn't bored, anyway.  Of <br/>
course, if they're not capable of "thinking outside the box", they <br/>
needn't try.  BUT, it could be good for them... I hear things like <br/>
this, and Sudoku puzzles, etc. help ward off Alzheimer's <br/>
Disease.  HEY, if a 60 year old carpenter from Arkansas can solve it, <br/>
surely they can.  So, fellows, IF you decide to take up the <br/>
challenge, keep me posted on your progress, if you will.  :-D<br/>

Hey, Mosey,,,<br/>
<br/>
NOW, I'm *really* confused... By the time I mentioned "thinking <br/>
outside the box", it was the 6th post under the subject line "Case <br/>
Solved" (NOT a subject line of "Thinking Outside the Box").  IF in <br/>
fact, as you stated above: "I read the case closed subject line <br/>
because that was, to me, yippee yippee yippee, case solved and case <br/>
OVER." I'm NOW wondering, WHY isn't your 'delete' button worn out by <br/>
deleting those posts with subject line: "Case Solved", instead of <br/>
reading and REPLYING to the 11th post under this subject line?  I'm <br/>
new to this forum, and don't know what is the second, or third time <br/>
around, but, it still seems strange to me that a subject that doesn't <br/>
interest certain folks still gets read, and REPLIED to.  Can you enlighten me?<br/>

&gt;Hey, Mosey,,,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;NOW, I'm *really* confused... By the time I mentioned "thinking<br/>
&gt;outside the box", it was the 6th post under the subject line "Case<br/>
&gt;Solved" (NOT a subject line of "Thinking Outside the Box").  IF in<br/>
&gt;fact, as you stated above: "I read the case closed subject line<br/>
&gt;because that was, to me, yippee yippee yippee, case solved and case<br/>
&gt;OVER." I'm NOW wondering, WHY isn't your 'delete' button worn out by<br/>
&gt;deleting those posts with subject line: "Case Solved", instead of<br/>
&gt;reading and REPLYING to the 11th post under this subject line?  I'm<br/>
&gt;new to this forum, and don't know what is the second, or third time<br/>
&gt;around, but, it still seems strange to me that a subject that doesn't<br/>
&gt;interest certain folks still gets read, and REPLIED to.  Can you enlighten<br/>
&gt;me?<br/>

&gt;These posts aren't "The Case", so there's no reason not to read them.  If<br/>
