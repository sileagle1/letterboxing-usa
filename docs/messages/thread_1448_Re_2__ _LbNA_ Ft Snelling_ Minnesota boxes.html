<br/>
Eventually, unless some system is in place, then the "catalogue" (on<br/>
paper) or on a website becomes 'useless'..which damages the hobby..and<br/>
so...<br/>
<br/>
so here's my two cents worth..<br/>
<br/>
It may help in the control of<br/>
1. Real Lost boxes<br/>
2. "Maybe" lost letterboxes<br/>
3. Lost "letterboxers" !<br/>
4. Damaged Boxes .. eg wet books<br/>
5. Database Archive &amp; Validity<br/>
<br/>
The UK system is that a box is "live" for two years..after that it is<br/>
considered "off the moor" ..ok that's "Dartmoor speak" for "gone" or<br/>
"taken in"..<br/>
<br/>
So its "automatically" deleted from the main catalogue (in LbNA case<br/>
'web-site') ...unless the owner re-registers it ..<br/>
<br/>
There are a few 'green' and personal responsibility issues here too: <br/>
<br/>
The owner must (if they are honest) check and perhaps re-site a box  after<br/>
2 years (or whatever you chose) ..This protects the environment and boxers<br/>
nerves <grin><br/>
<br/>
As you say the owner can move it , pull it in , declare it missing etc !<br/>
at any time in those two year too...<br/>
<br/>
Then the catalogue gets amended whatever the situation .<br/>
<br/>
In the UK "polite" boxers are also expected to maintain their boxes ..ie<br/>
visit them once in a while (every 3-4 months maybe ?)..and fix the books<br/>
etc and report on any changes...<br/>
<br/>
If a box is "not found" by hunters the catalogue can have an entry of all<br/>
"not found" incidences and the dates...<br/>
<br/>
(In this LbNA hi-tech catalogue system maybe the owner can get an email to<br/>
"go check".)<br/>
<br/>
...but even if the owner has vanished ..after 2 years the box expires and<br/>
the problem or query box vanishes from the catalogue..So nerves are<br/>
soothed..and adventurers get some warnings that things may not be quite as<br/>
expected !...<br/>
<br/>
Messages about poor condition boxes and or wet books could  also be<br/>
recorded..<br/>
<br/>
OK this now shows how important and big this cataloguing can get ..We have<br/>
at least two issues a year of our catalogue in a "big book" and monthly<br/>
updates which includes messages about lost boxes / wet books/ found a<br/>
compass / found a collectors book/ found a lost letterboxer <grin> /<br/>
arrangements for meetings and special outings / new trails etc etc<br/>
etc....but we've used paper based systems for a long long time so it's<br/>
sorta got organised that way...but that's why it's got to be such a big<br/>
hobby I guess..phew ..<br/>
<br/>
Sorry my 2c worth sorta grew too <grin>...<br/>
<br/>
Hope that sparks some ideas...<br/>
<br/>
Don't you just love this crazy ol' hobby !<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing<br/>

A similar system may work well here.  What I would propose is <br/>
that for any box posted on the site, we establish a way for *any*<br/>
letterboxer to report that the box is still in place, and when.  That<br/>
way we have confirmations of the box out there, without having the<br/>
original owner necessarily having to do it.  (Handles cases like<br/>
if the letterbox placer moves to another state/country/continent).<br/>
<br/>
A MIA list would be nice however, since I've run into a *lot*<br/>
of missing/damaged/empty boxes over the years.<br/>
