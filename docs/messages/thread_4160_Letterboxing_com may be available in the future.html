<br/>
I have decided I do  not have time to maintain the Letterboxing <br/>
International site (letterboxing.com). I am way too busy with other <br/>
things and don't have the time or energy to keep it up to date.  I am <br/>
willing to consider turning over the domain name free of charge at <br/>
renewal time (this spring I think)to some other persons who would <br/>
like to maintain a letterboxing related site. There are only a couple <br/>
of firm requirements that I would need to do that. The site must <br/>
remain noncommercial, must be completely independent of <br/>
letterboxing.org site, and should be developed by the consensus of <br/>
all members who wish to participate in it's development. If any group <br/>
of people is interested you can contact me directly. I am _not_ <br/>
guaranteeing I will turn it over to just anyone. It would have to be <br/>
a situation that I feel comfortable with. Please contact me off list <br/>
for any questions rather than burdening the main list with such <br/>
discussion. Thanks.<br/>
