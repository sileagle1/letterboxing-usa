                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Graham, for those pickies!  I had a completely different idea of<br/>
letterboxing UK style...I thought that everyone there was very solitary and<br/>
secretive, and not willing to share or talk about their conquests.  This<br/>
was stressed in the famous Smithsonian article about the subject.  It's<br/>
nice to know that it's not all serious there!!<br/>
<br/>
Those pictures were great...and what's all the beer memorobilia?  Pub<br/>
collecting, too?  Budweiser mats, Beck's hats, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting these...they were fun on a Monday morning!<br/>
