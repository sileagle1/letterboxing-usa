I know I had it in January. I sent out three boxes on the same day<br/>
(they had arrived while I was away for just over a week on vacation).<br/>
I don't remember which one of the three it was (one was to Macgrath,<br/>
one to TeamPresSinOn, and one to Pam Lemelin) but I got delivery<br/>
confirmation on all of them and they all arrived before the end of<br/>
January. Hope that helps. If it makes you feel any better, I haven't<br/>
heard from Sam the Camera Man, my postal LB in a while either, but I'm<br/>
sure that they're both out there somewhere and will turn up eventually!<br/>
