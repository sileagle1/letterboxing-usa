&gt; Don't forget to make sure the venue (building access, etc.) is <br/>
&gt; wheelchair<br/>
&gt; accessible.   You never know when a person who uses a wheelchair <br/>
will<br/>
&gt; attend.  My husband has a power wheelchair.  We have found 2 LBs.<br/>
&gt; Yes, we'll work on finding more.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mary,<br/>
<br/>
Our Meadow Park has paved pathways throughout. Most of the boxes may <br/>
need someone to go a little off into the grass (also well cut) but <br/>
nothing too drastic. How does the wheelchair affect compass readings?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW, we don't mind if boxes are not in accessible locations.  Most <br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; important parts of Yosemite are not wheelchair accessible &amp; we <br/>
&gt; wouldn't ask<br/>
&gt; for Half Dome to be made accessible.   <g><br/>

There are plenty of boxes closeby that would not be accessible. Folks <br/>
are welcome to get those, too, of course. <br/>
<br/>
Hope we can see you down here next Saturday.<br/>

Give you a piece of Kraft singles to race if you do...<br/>
