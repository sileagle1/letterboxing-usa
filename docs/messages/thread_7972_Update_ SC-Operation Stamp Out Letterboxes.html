                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past weekend I visited Harbison State Forest near Columbia, SC in<br/>
search of Ladybug's Operation Stamp Out letterboxes. I'm sorry to report<br/>
suspected vandalism.  <br/>
<br/>
I found the first box, Exhibit No. 1  Columbia SC Letterbox, in its hiding<br/>
place, but it was missing both stamp and logbook. <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure I was in the correct location of the second box, Exhibit No. 2 <br/>
Harbison State Forest, since the "double trunked, V-shaped tree"  was<br/>
fairly easy to find. I looked under every downed tree in the vicinity to no<br/>
avail.  <br/>
<br/>
I did  find the third box, Exhibit No. 3  The USC Gamecock.  I assume the<br/>
reason it was still in its hiding place is because the vandals were too<br/>
lazy to hike all the way to the bluffs.  <br/>
<br/>
The #9 post to identify the location of the fourth box, Exhibit No. 4  The<br/>
Riverbanks Zoo, was missing. I hiked back and forth between post #8 and #10<br/>
several times without locating the "trio of trees".  A very frustrating<br/>
experience!  <br/>
