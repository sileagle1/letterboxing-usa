                    <div class="plaintext-content">Jess and I had a successfull two days of letterboxing in the <br/>
Portland area.  We got over a dozen boxes in the Oregon City area as <br/>
well as Tryon Creek Park.  Updates on the boxes we found:<br/>
<br/>
Oregon City Boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Perseus Box:  Alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
Duck's Pond friends #1:  Alive and well.  What a cool little pond!<br/>
<br/>
Duck's Pond friends #2:  Well, the box is there.  However, we have <br/>
to confirm an earlier post that the stamp is missing.  We heard that <br/>
the stamp fell off the bridge in to the blackberry bushes.  I risked <br/>
life and limb to crawl down there and look, but I couldn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
Frog Park Stamp:  Alive and well<br/>
<br/>
End of the Oregon Trail:  Alive and well with lots of visitors.  <br/>
There were a few people who were in there just a little earlier <br/>
that day!<br/>
<br/>
Nutria Box:  Alive and well.  We ended up walking around that dang <br/>
pond three times before finding it though!  Didn't see any nutria, <br/>
but saw some baby ducks that were awefully frightened of us humans.<br/>
<br/>
Department of Redundancy Box:  Alive and well -- cute little park.<br/>
<br/>
CCC series:  All five are alive and well!<br/>
<br/>
Lucky Four at Atkinson Park:  Alive and well.  We were the first to <br/>
stamp in at this one.<br/>
<br/>
Fun Guy box, also at Atkinson Park:  Alive and well -- We were also <br/>
the first visitors here.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes in Tryan Park:<br/>
<br/>
Tryon Creek #1:  Alive and well -- lots of visitors!<br/>
<br/>
Tryon Creek #2:  See above<br/>
<br/>
Tryan Creek Orphan:  Alive and well!<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry -- we didn't attempt to hunt down tryon creek 3 and 4 <br/>
(running out of time, and we for some reason forgot the clues to #3 <br/>
at home!).  So near as we can tell, they are fine as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Bonus Material!!!! --&gt;  We also stumbled across the Redwing <br/>
Hitchiker, who apparantly got its start in VA.  We found him in the <br/>
fourth box in the Clackamas Community College series.  Where will he <br/>
end up next??  tiny hint:  he'll soon be leaving the portland area, <br/>
and may make a guest appearance at the grand opening of a new series <br/>
I'm soon going to plant.<br/>
