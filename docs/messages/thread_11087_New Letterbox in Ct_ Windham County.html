I saw people posting about charity boxes and thought it was a great <br/>
idea.  So I made this box up in memory of my Dad who died of cancer <br/>
almost 2 yrs ago.  For each stamp that is in the log book on his <br/>
birthday of each year, myself and Teach would donate $1 to the <br/>
American Cancer Society.  This will not cost anybody anything, please <br/>
don't leave money in the box.  All it will cost our fellow <br/>
letterboxers is the time to come out a stamp the box for a great <br/>
cause.  <br/>
Directions:<br/>
Go Rt. 171 west in Putnam.  You will turn into the St. Mary's <br/>
Cementary on your right(It's across from a Cumberland Farms) The <br/>
cementary has two orange angels at the enterance.  Go straight when <br/>
first entering.  At the Y go left, the second Y go left.  Make your <br/>
way to the building in back.  Park anywhere by the building.  In the <br/>
back of the building is a water spout.  From there walk straight <br/>
ahead to the 7th row.  Down that row you will see the Book of Life.  <br/>
