which is not so very box-happy yet.  But I would LOVE to get up your <br/>
way because I did see that the hunting's good in your neck of the <br/>
woods.  AND along the Eastern seaboard.<br/>
<br/>
My traveling companion and fellow-hunter is from the UK.  So when I <br/>
went to visit him we went to Dartmoor.  About 10,000 hidden in and <br/>
around the Moors or so we'd heard.  My friend is coming to the States <br/>
in August/Sept and we plan to do some searching here, meaning the <br/>
US.  Want to go somewhere with a good concentration of boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your friendly welcome!<br/>

&gt; What part of the US will you land in?  Some areas are richer in <br/>
boxes than <br/>
&gt; others.<br/>
