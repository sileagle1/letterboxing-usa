Easy, great for families.  No poison ivy.  No snakes.  <br/>

	In 1898 the man who would become the world's most famous <br/>
architect established his first studio in his home in this leafy <br/>
suburb.  Before he left town for more famous studios in<br/>
Wisconsin and Arizona, he designed more than 25 buildings, leaving <br/>
the town an architectural legacy that draws tens of thousands of <br/>
visitors every year.  <br/>
	One of the architect's most beautiful buildings, only a block <br/>
away from the Home and Studio,  is the Frank W. Thomas House, built <br/>
in 1901.  Across the street from the Thomas House is this town's<br/>
only statue of this famous son.  Although the architect was very <br/>
short (and unappreciative owners of his buildings sometimes <br/>
complained that doors and ceilings were built more to his height than <br/>
to theirs) it still hardly seems fair that the bust is set in a rock <br/>
only about three feet off the ground.   Your search for the letterbox <br/>
begins with this statue.<br/>
	Just to the right of the statue a wrought iron gate leads <br/>
into a park.  Go into the park and take the path to your right.  <br/>
Follow the path past the wildflower gardens.  You will come to a<br/>
majestic tree, of the species obvious for the community (and no,<br/>
it's not a gingko).  The tree rises five or six feet from a huge <br/>
trunk, and then divides into two before continuing skyward. <br/>
     Near this tree you'll find a bench.  Have a seat and admire<br/>
the tree. When you're ready to continue, turn around and locate the<br/>
light pole immediately behind the bench.  The box is under the base <br/>
of the light pole on the east side.  Please be discreet because the <br/>
park gets fairly heavy use.      <br/>
