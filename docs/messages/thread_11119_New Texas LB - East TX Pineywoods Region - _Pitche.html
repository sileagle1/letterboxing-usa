The Big Thicket Ntl Preserve has multiple units in eastern Texas.  <br/>
Each of these protects a diverse part or nature.  The Turkey Creek <br/>
Unit contains a Wetland Savannah, which is an open grassy flatland <br/>
dotted with widely scattered longleaf pine trees.  The ground is <br/>
covered with an array of grasses, sedges, rushes, and wildflowers; <br/>
including four species of carnivorous plants, which includes the <br/>
Pitcher Plant.  The Pitcher Plant, with its long, narrow funnel-<br/>
shaped leaves, represents a pitfall type trap.  The outside surface <br/>
of each leaf is dotted with nectar glands which are most numerous at <br/>
the funnel's opening.  The nectar attracts an insect to the opening <br/>
and once inside it finds it difficult to escape.  Lack of foothold <br/>
and downward-pointing hairs prevents escape, and the insect falls <br/>
into fluid that collects in the base.  The plant then digests the <br/>
insect for food.  <br/>
<br/>
