All the boxes in this series are easy to find.<br/>
The boxes in this series are Pennsylvania Wildlife.<br/>

You can find them all in the Allegheny National Forest.<br/>

Box 1 - Spring Peeper <br/>
This is the easiest.... It is on the NORTH COUNTRY TRAIL<br/>
Not more than 110 yards from the road.<br/>
<br/>
Directions....<br/>
Find these things and you will be successful:<br/>
The border between Warren and Forest County.<br/>
The devil's highway.... the route number is 666.<br/>
State Road 2001 (Minister Road).<br/>
Head North towards Cherry Grove.<br/>
The North Country Trail Crosses the road about two miles up.<br/>
Walk East on the trail.<br/>
About 100 yards into the woods, there is a short logging road<br/>
   which bears to the right while the trail bears left.<br/>
Follow the logging road to the end (20 feet).<br/>
There is a big clearcut.<br/>
Look to your left and down.<br/>
There is a tree with an un-natural looking pile of rocks.<br/>
The rocks conceal a hollow in the base of the tree.<br/>
Bingo! Stamp me please!<br/>
Now wasnt than easy? The next one is a little harder, but not too much.<br/>

sounds like a relaly nice series coming up...  I do have one concern though.  I've always felt like I wanted to include at least one compass bearing inmy clues, becasue I felt (perhaps unjustiably) that it might cut down on vandalism to the box.  the rationale being that a person would have to set out w/ a compass to fins the box, and  therefore less likely to be found by chance.  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
I do look forward to seeing your stamp images.  Will need to find an excuse to make it ot the NW corner of the state.<br/>
