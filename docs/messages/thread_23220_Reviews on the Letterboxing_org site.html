i don't believe anyone expects you to read through the thousands of posts<br/>
that are here. you can do a simple search. however, i highly recommend that<br/>
you do. perhaps you will then really understand letterboxing.<br/>

This is my first time posting, but I do think that I have a relevant<br/>
subject to discuss, and if it has been discussed previously, please<br/>
except my apologies for not backreading.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that the letterboxing.org site should have a way for registered<br/>
users to write a short review of each of the letterboxes they have<br/>
found. I have been doing this letterboxing thing for a little while<br/>
now, and I have found that some of the clues are very well written,<br/>
and the hikes are great. These are the hikes I would like to recommend<br/>
them to others, while I also find some clues to be poorly written, or<br/>
that the letterbox was hidden in plain site ten feet from the road,<br/>
making the trip rather anti-climatic.   <br/>
<br/>
If that system doesn't sound palatable, perhaps even a "five star"<br/>
rating for each clue, so that users can rate each "lb" they find.  I<br/>
feel that woud give other users a better idea if they would like to do<br/>
the trek or not, as well as give the person who placed the letterbox<br/>
feedback on whether or not people liked it, so they can improve upon<br/>
future clues and letterboxes.  Maybe users could rate different<br/>
aspects, like how much they like the stamp, how well the clue was<br/>
written, how much they liked the hike, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>

&gt; What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
Some thoughts reiterated countless times in the history of this talk <br/>
list:<br/>
<br/>
1. It's about the journey. <br/>
2. Not every letterbox is for every person.<br/>
3. If it *ain't* broke, don't fix it.<br/>
4. Just because you didn't find it the first time<br/>
(or second, or third, etc.,...you get the picture), doesn't mean it's <br/>
not there or that the clues are poorly written. <br/>
5. There *is* a learning curve. <br/>
6. When you ask nicely and don't expect things handed to you, most <br/>
letterboxers are happy to oblige and point you in a direction where <br/>
you can learn and improve your placing, finding and artistic skills. I <br/>
urge you to join the Newboxers list. Many veteran boxers lurk there <br/>
and are happy to share.<br/>
<br/>
With all due respect to what you have written, as a newcomer to <br/>
letterboxing, perhaps you'd be happier conducting your letterbox <br/>
searches and posting subsequent post-search commentary at Atlas Quest, <br/>
a most worthy letterboxing site with many more bells and whistles for <br/>
those so inclined to document and/or editorialize the *journey* beyond <br/>
the personal joy of remembrance of adventures gleaned by thumbing <br/>
through your own logbook. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

  This topic has come up a lot recently and there are many people who  feel the same way you do. There are also many epople who do not. I  happen to be in the second group.<br/>
<br/>
  Letterboxing for me is about surprise, adventure, problem solving,  mystery and finally, as sense of accomplishment when I actually find  the box. And on the days when I don't, I just re-group and try again  another time.<br/>
<br/>
  I love reading the comments in the log book, and for me that's enough  feedback from others. I don't want their experience, good or bad, or  their personal opinions about the stamp or the hike to effect my  decision to hunt the box. I would have missed out on so much cool stuff  otherwise if it was just about the stamp in the box.<br/>
<br/>
  I would hate ot see this happen. JMHO<br/>

   Placers who would prefer logs could choose that option for their clue page.<br/>
   The default for a clue page would be no logs. Those placers who want it would activate the log feature. <br/>
<br/>
   It would be great comfort if placers could have control of the logs i.e. given the option to delete or encrypt spoilers.<br/>
   Finders who do not want the adventure spoiled by logs would be advised not to read the logs.<br/>
   If all logs appear encrypted and in order to read them one must click on the decrypt link, then finders who don't want to read the logs won't inadvertently see them.<br/>

<br/>
   Letterboxing for me is about surprise, adventure, problem solving,  mystery and finally, as sense of accomplishment when I actually find  the box. And on the days when I don't, I just re-group and try again  another time.<br/>
<br/>
   I love reading the comments in the log book, and for me that's enough  feedback from others. I don't want their experience, good or bad, or  their personal opinions about the stamp or the hike to effect my  decision to hunt the box. I would have missed out on so much cool stuff  otherwise if it was just about the stamp in the box.<br/>
<br/>
   I would hate ot see this happen. JMHO<br/>

   I think that the letterboxing.org site should have a way for registered<br/>

   that the letterbox was hidden in plain site ten feet from the road,<br/>
   making the trip rather anti-climatic.   <br/>
<br/>
   If that system doesn't sound palatable, perhaps even a "five star"<br/>
   rating for each clue, so that users can rate each "lb" they find.  I<br/>
   feel that woud give other users a better idea if they would like to do<br/>
   the trek or not, as well as give the person who placed the letterbox<br/>
   feedback on whether or not people liked it, so they can improve upon<br/>
   future clues and letterboxes.  Maybe users could rate different<br/>
   aspects, like how much they like the stamp, how well the clue was<br/>
   written, how much they liked the hike, etc.<br/>

   What do you think?<br/>

I go for a Hikers and Hounds box I'll get a great<br/>
stamp, when I go for a Lighing Bug box I'll get a head<br/>

Over the years I've come to know these people on a<br/>

My point is this... If you don't want to read the reviews that would<br/>
be posted on the site, I am sure there is a way to code it, so that<br/>
you didn't have to read it.  No one would force you.  If a lot of<br/>
people have brought this up before, obviously there is a demand for it. <br/>

&gt; I'm in favor of optional logs (reviews):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    Placers who would prefer logs could choose that option for <br/>

&gt;    The default for a clue page would be no logs. Those placers who <br/>
want it would activate the log feature. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    It would be great comfort if placers could have control of the <br/>
logs i.e. given the option to delete or encrypt spoilers.<br/>
&gt;    Finders who do not want the adventure spoiled by logs would be <br/>
advised not to read the logs.<br/>
&gt;    If all logs appear encrypted and in order to read them one must <br/>
click on the decrypt link, then finders who don't want to read the <br/>
logs won't inadvertently see them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
You already have the capability to have this on your clues!<br/>
Once you receive input from a finder(contact the placer) all you <br/>
have to do is copy and paste that info onto your clue sheet via the <br/>
edit function. You can have all of the logs you wish, just set it up <br/>
yourself instead of continuosly beating this drum.<br/>
<br/>
I realize some finders want every little bit of info they can glean, <br/>
but most placers don't want these bells and whistles. If that is <br/>
what you want then just do it as you have control now.<br/>
I believe there would be more  placers that would pull their clues <br/>

comments' regarding letterboxes on LBNA.  Odd--because I do allow the <br/>
comments on my own personal clue site...but I regularly monitor (I mena <br/>
daily here for a couple hundred letterboxes) and purge the comments of <br/>
any notes that might reveal the 'mysterious' aspects of the hunt itself <br/>
for the boxes we've planted.  I put a lot of effort into crafting clues <br/>
that possess a certain level of mystique.  In one fell swoop folks can <br/>
comment to the clues and instantly negate all the work that was put <br/>
into it to ensure they were mystery boxes or at least boxes that had <br/>
clues that required 'some' level of mental diligence to solve.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I get lots of false missing reports.  I'm also responsible for my <br/>
own share of false missing reports to other letterbox planters (I'm <br/>
sure I just filed 3 of them this past weekend alone due to operator <br/>
head, space &amp; timing issues!!!).  I'm sure most of us are guilty of <br/>
that.  But--in the past month we have personally found 3 letterboxes <br/>
that were 'officially' listed as missing and they were indeed in the <br/>
very spot where the clues suggested they were.  The owners <br/>
had 'pulled/retired' the clues because of false missing reports they'd <br/>
received over time. The only reason we even looked for those boxes was <br/>
because we still had a set of clues in a clue binder we'd assembled a <br/>
couple of years ago, had no idea they were 'considered' missing and <br/>
just happened to have the notebook lying in the car on our trip. These <br/>
are some of the risks folks face when they incorporate the online box <br/>
status/clue comment section on the website.  I'm sure there are <br/>
hundreds of other 'abandoned' letterboxes across this fruitful plain <br/>
that fall into this category because of myriad false missing reports.  <br/>
Just a different take on the matter.  No hurt feelings intended just <br/>
lessons learned from the school of letterboxing hard knocks.  daelphinus<br/>

I'm not suggesting that logging function be implemented on every clue<br/>
sheet. I'm asking for an option. Some of us placers enjoy feedback and<br/>
would like that function on their personal clue page. I'm all in favor<br/>
of placers not using a logging feature. Each to his own. <br/>
<br/>
Feedback inspires me to hide more letterboxes. Feedback also helps me<br/>
tweak the clues to make it a more enjoyable experience for the finder. <br/>
<br/>
I'm unclear why you would not want finders to have the ability to post<br/>
their own comments to my clue page without me having to act as a<br/>
go-between.<br/>

I realize that anything anyone says can end up anyplace anytime on the<br/>
internet.  That doesn't mean that I consider it ethical behavior however.<br/>
And I wouldn't contribute to it if I knew it was happening in what I<br/>
considered an unethical manner.<br/>

 Once you receive input from a finder(contact the placer) all you<br/>

 yourself instead of continuosly beating this drum.<br/>

<br/>
It would be better if finders had the option to log their own comments if<br/>
they choose to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what Mosey said in a previous post and makes a good point:<br/>
<br/>
"This would probably keep me from contacting a placer.  If I send a private<br/>
note to a placer commenting about a box, I don't want it to end up on a<br/>
website without my permission.  And even if I send something to the local<br/>
discussion group, that doesn't mean I want it going anyplace else without my<br/>
permission."<br/>
<br/>
 I realize some finders want every little bit of info they can glean,<br/>
 but most placers don't want these bells and whistles. If that is<br/>
 what you want then just do it as you have control now.<br/>
 I believe there would be more  placers that would pull their clues<br/>
 and go to an underground site if a logging function were to be<br/>
 implimented for every clue sheet.<br/>

Try reading back just a month or two and get a feel for the group.<br/>
<br/>
If you're new to letterboxing, join the newboxers list.  And, as was<br/>
suggested, join the regional list from whatever area of the country you're<br/>
in.  As you get to know fellow local boxers, you'll have more opportunity to<br/>
compare notes in a discussion-type environment where there can maybe be some<br/>
give and take as to the "rating" a box should have, if critiquing is what<br/>
floats your boat *and* if it floats boats on whatever regional list you<br/>
join.<br/>
<br/>
All that having more and more of such features on LbNA will mean is that<br/>
more and more boxers will steer clear of LbNA with their clues, as is<br/>
already beginning to happen.<br/>
<br/>
The point isn't whether or not you're capable of backpacking and using a<br/>
compass.  The point is -- who are *you* as an individual to rate anybody<br/>
else's box?  There might be a box that you deem "unworthy" that somebody<br/>
else might have done the best they possibly could working on it.  Or it<br/>
might be designed for a family with young children or one that handicapped<br/>
individuals would relish that you, with all your military expertise, will<br/>
find utterly boring.  (This discussion is beginning to feel very<br/>
familiar.....)<br/>
<br/>
Find enough boxes to give you a solid idea of what it's all about.  Then<br/>
start carving your own stamps, writing your own clues, and placing your own<br/>
boxes.  Do what *you* want to do with *your* boxes and maybe folks who like<br/>
them will use them as an example and follow suit.  And maybe you'll start to<br/>
realize that letterboxing is an art form rather than a canvassing or polling<br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
For a placer who feels the feedback is necessary to "tweak" their boxes, why<br/>
not merely place a note in the clues encouraging people to send you<br/>
feedback?  It seems to me that if this was the main reason a placer wanted<br/>
feedback, then asking for feedback in the clues would suffice.  Public<br/>
posting of positive feedback in many cases seems more like an ego trip to<br/>
me.  There's something to be said for humility.<br/>

all of the boxes that I have set out to find, but that is not my point.<br/>
<br/>
My point is this... If you don't want to read the reviews that would<br/>
be posted on the site, I am sure there is a way to code it, so that<br/>
you didn't have to read it.  No one would force you.  If a lot of<br/>
people have brought this up before, obviously there is a demand for it.<br/>

&gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is my first time posting, but I do think that I have a <br/>
relevant<br/>
&gt; subject to discuss, and if it has been discussed previously, please<br/>
&gt; except my apologies for not backreading.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that the letterboxing.org site should have a way for <br/>
registered<br/>
&gt; users to write a short review of each of the letterboxes they have<br/>
&gt; found. I have been doing this letterboxing thing for a little while<br/>
&gt; now, and I have found that some of the clues are very well written,<br/>
&gt; and the hikes are great. These are the hikes I would like to <br/>
recommend<br/>
&gt; them to others, while I also find some clues to be poorly written, <br/>
or<br/>
&gt; that the letterbox was hidden in plain site ten feet from the road,<br/>
&gt; making the trip rather anti-climatic.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If that system doesn't sound palatable, perhaps even a "five star"<br/>
&gt; rating for each clue, so that users can rate each "lb" they find.  <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; feel that woud give other users a better idea if they would like <br/>
to do<br/>
&gt; the trek or not, as well as give the person who placed the <br/>
letterbox<br/>
&gt; feedback on whether or not people liked it, so they can improve <br/>
upon<br/>
&gt; future clues and letterboxes.  Maybe users could rate different<br/>
&gt; aspects, like how much they like the stamp, how well the clue was<br/>
&gt; written, how much they liked the hike, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you think?<br/>

&gt; I'm not suggesting that logging function be implemented <br/>

&gt; us placers enjoy feedback and would like that function <br/>
&gt; on their personal clue page. I'm all in favor of placers <br/>
&gt; not using a logging feature. Each to his own. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feedback inspires me to hide more letterboxes. Feedback <br/>
&gt; also helps me tweak the clues to make it a more enjoyable<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm unclear why you would not want finders to have the <br/>
&gt; ability to post their own comments to my clue page without <br/>
&gt; me having to act as a go-between.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
The LbNA website already provides the option to provide feedback to a <br/>
planter.  All a finder needs to do is click on contact the placer and <br/>
send a note.  While it is true that this does not then appear <br/>
publically on the clue page, if indeed your desire is simply for <br/>
feedback to assist you with writing better clues and motivate you to <br/>
plant future boxes, you should be able to get this from user feedback <br/>
whether it is public or private.  I'm unclear why you feel this <br/>
feedback should be made public.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think it is so much a matter of not wanting finders to have <br/>
the ability to post their comments on your boxes.  They are your <br/>
boxes, you can do as you wish with them.  Rather it is that the <br/>
opposition is toward configuring the common website to serve this <br/>
purpose.  If you want to implement a logging feature, there are ways <br/>
that you can set this up yourself on your own website.  Granted, that <br/>
may require effort on your part, but it simply is not something that <br/>
enough people consider to be fundamental to the philosophy of <br/>
letterboxing to make it part of letterboxing.org.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us are content with the current option provided for user <br/>
feedback -- contact the placer.<br/>

What happens when you get to a box after a long day of hiking and <br/>

I can see how someone would feel  upset if their personal comments were cut and pasted somewhere else  without permission. I think it could also be awkward for the person who  sent a personal note to be asked for permission to post it publicly. <br/>

  It should be in the hands of the finder about whether they want to post  an online public log or just send a personal note or of course, not to  send a note either publicly or privately.<br/>

  previous post that rather implied to me that you might take comments sent to<br/>
  you and just post them in your clues without first checking with the person<br/>
  who had written the comment.  *That's* what I object to.  You'll notice that<br/>
  twice in my comments I state I wouldn't want my comments ending up on a<br/>
  website someplace *without my permission* and that if I found out that a<br/>
  person was likely to do that, then I just wouldn't contact them about any of<br/>
  their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
  I realize that anything anyone says can end up anyplace anytime on the<br/>
  internet.  That doesn't mean that I consider it ethical behavior however.<br/>
  And I wouldn't contribute to it if I knew it was happening in what I<br/>
  considered an unethical manner.<br/>

  It would be better if finders had the option to log their own comments if<br/>

  Here's what Mosey said in a previous post and makes a good point:<br/>
<br/>
  "This would probably keep me from contacting a placer.  If I send a private<br/>
  note to a placer commenting about a box, I don't want it to end up on a<br/>
  website without my permission.  And even if I send something to the local<br/>
  discussion group, that doesn't mean I want it going anyplace else without my<br/>
  permission."<br/>
<br/>
   I realize some finders want every little bit of info they can glean,<br/>
   but most placers don't want these bells and whistles. If that is<br/>
   what you want then just do it as you have control now.<br/>
   I believe there would be more  placers that would pull their clues<br/>
   and go to an underground site if a logging function were to be<br/>
   implimented for every clue sheet.<br/>

Letterboxing into similar concepts that the Geocaching site uses.<br/>

This is not Geocaching!!!!!!<br/>

 Whenever this topic comes up there is a sizable difference between <br/>

Personally I wouldn't care for a rating system on letterboxing.org <br/>
because obviously with thousands of people you get a thousand <br/>
different reactions &amp; opinions on everything. <br/>
I agree that joining your regional chat list would be benifical. I <br/>
also would suggest something like a blog or heck even a livejournal <br/>
for your comments. Then when people stumble across YOUR page with <br/>
YOUR opinions on how the hike was or how well carved the stamp may <br/>
be then they can't really complain. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this didn't come off too rudely, as that was certainly not my <br/>
intent. <br/>

&gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is my first time posting, but I do think that I have a <br/>
relevant<br/>
&gt; subject to discuss, and if it has been discussed previously, please<br/>
&gt; except my apologies for not backreading.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that the letterboxing.org site should have a way for <br/>
registered<br/>
&gt; users to write a short review of each of the letterboxes they have<br/>
&gt; found. I have been doing this letterboxing thing for a little while<br/>
&gt; now, and I have found that some of the clues are very well written,<br/>
&gt; and the hikes are great. These are the hikes I would like to <br/>
recommend<br/>
&gt; them to others, while I also find some clues to be poorly written, <br/>
or<br/>
&gt; that the letterbox was hidden in plain site ten feet from the road,<br/>
&gt; making the trip rather anti-climatic.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If that system doesn't sound palatable, perhaps even a "five star"<br/>
&gt; rating for each clue, so that users can rate each "lb" they find.  <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; feel that woud give other users a better idea if they would like <br/>
to do<br/>
&gt; the trek or not, as well as give the person who placed the <br/>
letterbox<br/>
&gt; feedback on whether or not people liked it, so they can improve <br/>
upon<br/>
&gt; future clues and letterboxes.  Maybe users could rate different<br/>
&gt; aspects, like how much they like the stamp, how well the clue was<br/>
&gt; written, how much they liked the hike, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What do you think?<br/>

Perhaps there is an alternative perspective.  Recall that a couple of <br/>
weeks ago there was a rather degenerative flame war sprung out of the <br/>
owner of geocaching.com putting together a letterboxing site <br/>
[letterboxer.com or some such].  Consider that this site will <br/>
probably have all the feedback bells and whistles that the <br/>
geocacher/letterboxer person could want.  Basically, geocaching.com <br/>
for letterboxers.  The group that wants letterboxing.org to change <br/>
has the sort of site that they desire, and they could choose to <br/>
populate it with their clues and such.  Letterboxing.org would remain <br/>
as it, to the satisfaction of the vast majority of letterboxers who <br/>
actually do like things just the way they are.<br/>
<br/>
On a personal note, I would probably not populate such a site with my <br/>
box clues, but there does appear to be a group of people who would.  <br/>
They are happy, I am happy.  Nobody necessarily needs to change.<br/>
<br/>
Please do interpret this as an endorsement for this sort of site, as <br/>
it is not.  It is merely an attempt at illustrating a perspective <br/>
that could bring about a solution for those who desire the feedback <br/>
mechanism.<br/>

<br/>
I knew about letterboxing when the Smithsonian article came out in<br/>
1998. I was reading the LBNA yahoo group and visiting the website<br/>
years before I heard about geocaching, hoping that some letterboxing<br/>
activity would show up in my area. I just haven't started posting to<br/>
the yahoo discussion group under my trail name until last year. I'm<br/>
not new to letterboxing , I've seen the history develop. <br/>
I've been hiding letterboxes since 2002. I remember the LBNA site back<br/>
when you had to post the clues to the group and have the webmasters<br/>
put it in the database. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; You certainly can <br/>
&gt; create your own type of site or play the game the way many of us do.<br/>
<br/>
That's not so easy to do. You need good web skills to create a site<br/>
like LBNA, AQ and GC.com (php, sql). But it requires only a basic<br/>
understanding of html or no html knowledge at all to play the games<br/>
bare bones, i.e. WOM. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; We aren't asking you to stay why ask us to change?<br/>

I'm not asking you to change. You can play the game bare bones if you<br/>
like.  <br/>

For the sake of clarity and truth please acknowledge that you would <br/>
like the LbNA site changed. You presently have 57 letterboxes listed <br/>
on LbNA and of that figure 24 of them are vituals. What you are <br/>
asking is that the functions on the site be changed for you. I <br/>
haven't bothered to figure out the exact percentage of the total on <br/>
LbNA that your number comes to but it is really a pretty small part <br/>
of the 20,000 + letterboxes listed. This site isn't about you, nor <br/>
is about any one personality. It is a pretty well functioning site <br/>
considering that it is free and available to everyone. I reiterate <br/>
if you want to use the edit function as a Placer it is available and <br/>
since you know how to post clues, edit your clues then you can post <br/>
whatever info you wish on your clue sheets. Do your own work rather <br/>
than casting off to someone else. If you wish to continue this <br/>
discussion please send me communication directly as I'm sure some <br/>
folks are really getting bored with this.<br/>

For what it's worth, this type of thing happens several times every<br/>
year.  A person starts letterboxing and as they explore/learn about<br/>
the hobby, they share ideas they believe could make letterboxing<br/>
better. Bam, down comes the hammer.  If some of the posts make you<br/>
feel like a heretic, don't sweat it.  It happens all the time.  The LB<br/>
community at times can be a bit resistant to change and newcomers. <br/>
Just keep boxing and watching the posts.  In time you'll see throught<br/>
the chaff and sort out how you'll letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Here's some of the "hot topics" you'll see in the coming months:<br/>
<br/>
1. Geocaching is ruining letterboxing<br/>
2. There should be a test for newbies before they can plant boxes<br/>
3. Let's make the official rules of letterboxing<br/>
4. I'm sick of what's become of LB, I'm taking my clues offline for friends only<br/>
5. White stuff vs. Pink stuff<br/>
6. Drive by boxes aren't letterboxing<br/>
7. How and what should be counted<br/>
8. The classic...South Carolina legislation against LBing.<br/>
9. Planting in National Parks<br/>
10.  I'm quiting the group because it's gotten so hostile.<br/>
<br/>
In the end there is no official way to letterbox.  You do it as you<br/>
do.  As long as you're respectful of others, the environment and the<br/>
boxes themselves, the rest is just noise.<br/>

Sorry Don, I'm sure people are getting bored and are probably hitting<br/>

personally and rather chose a public forum, I will reply publicly.<br/>
<br/>
You seem bothered by my lack of real boxes on the site (33) and by the<br/>
number of virtuals (24). The virtuals were placed on the LBNA site by<br/>
the request of 2 other letterboxers who wanted to record them here. I<br/>
like to be accomodating to finders if I can be. <br/>
<br/>
I did a check to see how many you have placed on the site. I found<br/>
that gwendontoo is not on the LBNA list of placers. <br/>

*hehe* Well, I do too.... I think you encourage way too many people to<br/>
run around in the woods packing heat, but hey, what do I care? As long<br/>
as they don't shoot me, I don't really care. =)<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm unclear why you feel this <br/>
&gt; &gt; feedback should be made public.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To encourage folks to visit my letterboxes. To make the experience of<br/>
&gt; the finder a better one. <br/>

I don't know.  I think your reputation as a placer is all the<br/>
encouragement one should need.<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious, though.  Why not go over to Atlas Quest and list your<br/>
boxes over there?  Maybe you have, I don't know your placer name on<br/>
LB.org.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, if this site did implement an optional logging mechanism<br/>
would you be back hounding those who have it turned off?  If not, then<br/>
what's the point?  To make every site function exactly the same?<br/>
<br/>
I don't get it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Greetings,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; This is my first time posting, but I do think that<br/>
&gt; I have a <br/>
&gt; relevant<br/>
&gt; &gt; subject to discuss, and if it has been discussed<br/>
&gt; previously, please<br/>
&gt; &gt; except my apologies for not backreading.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I think that the letterboxing.org site should have<br/>
&gt; a way for <br/>
&gt; registered<br/>
&gt; &gt; users to write a short review of each of the<br/>
&gt; letterboxes they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; found. I have been doing this letterboxing thing<br/>
&gt; for a little while<br/>
&gt; &gt; now, and I have found that some of the clues are<br/>
&gt; very well written,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the hikes are great. These are the hikes I<br/>
&gt; would like to <br/>
&gt; recommend<br/>
&gt; &gt; them to others, while I also find some clues to be<br/>
&gt; poorly written, <br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the letterbox was hidden in plain site ten<br/>
&gt; feet from the road,<br/>
&gt; &gt; making the trip rather anti-climatic.   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If that system doesn't sound palatable, perhaps<br/>
&gt; even a "five star"<br/>
&gt; &gt; rating for each clue, so that users can rate each<br/>
&gt; "lb" they find.  <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel that woud give other users a better idea if<br/>
&gt; they would like <br/>
&gt; to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; the trek or not, as well as give the person who<br/>
&gt; placed the <br/>
&gt; letterbox<br/>
&gt; &gt; feedback on whether or not people liked it, so<br/>
&gt; they can improve <br/>
&gt; upon<br/>
&gt; &gt; future clues and letterboxes.  Maybe users could<br/>
&gt; rate different<br/>
&gt; &gt; aspects, like how much they like the stamp, how<br/>
&gt; well the clue was<br/>
&gt; &gt; written, how much they liked the hike, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What do you think?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
