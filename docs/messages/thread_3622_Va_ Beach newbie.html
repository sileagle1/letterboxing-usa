                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all-I just got hooked (and got the entire family as well as my <br/>
best friend hooked <waving at="" mainetig="">)  Our first was the Flame of <br/>
Hope- excellent for a starter. :o) Got the Ft. Story and Fox Run <br/>
stamps last weekend. Fox Run was lots of fun- especially since we <br/>
first picked the wrong pine with a knot and a knoll! LOL  Was going <br/>
to try for Kingfisher but our poor old beagle, Buddy, was just too <br/>
pooped! Poor little guy. Hope to head out tomorrow to gather some <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
We are moving to Harrisburg, PA this summer.  I noticed a seeming <br/>
lack of boxes in that area and are a little disappointed.  Am I just <br/>
not looking for clues in the right area?  Any help?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

When I started boxing in New Jersey 6 monthes ago there were 11 <br/>
boxes.  I decided to rely on the old credo "Plant them and they will <br/>
come."  Well 6 monthes later, thanks to Todd, Kimberly,the Perfect <br/>
Circle Guide, and many others there are now 53 boxes in New Jersey.  <br/>
So go out and plant boxes, they will come.  And then they will plant <br/>
their own boxes and then...<br/>

I was just out checking my boxes this weekend and noticed you had <br/>
just found them. I wondered what you meant when you signed the log <br/>
book at Fox Run. Now I know, wrong pine with a knot and a knoll. Glad <br/>
you liked Flame of Hope and Fox Run. Kingfisher is still there and in <br/>
good shape. Hope you get a chance to find it soon. First Landing <br/>
State Park is really nice this time of year.<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun!<br/>
