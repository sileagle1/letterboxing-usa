Worry about your two Maine boxes no longer, they've both been stamped.  I went<br/>
up for a week of paddling, and managed to drag myself up to Acadia :)<br/>
Beautiful location on both.  Just one thing, there was a huge puddle of water<br/>
in the Cadillac Mtn box.  Everything in the ziploc was okay, and the puddle<br/>
was emptied.  <br/>
<br/>
And just a note for Randy. <br/>
Have you checked on your Eastern Shore of MD box recently?  Just curiouos,<br/>
because I'm almost positive I had the right spot, and there was no box there. <br/>
If you could just let me know when you've checked on it, I'll head over there<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Kimberly<br/>

That's great news. I didn't think I'd get the Thunder Hole clues <br/>
posted in time for you to see them before you left. I'm glad it <br/>
worked out.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for drying out the Cadillac Mt. box. Glad they've finally <br/>
gotten some rain up there. I'm surprised the box took on water <br/>
though. I opened it just seven days earlier, and it was fine then. <br/>
Maybe I didn't shut the lid securely. Oh well.<br/>
