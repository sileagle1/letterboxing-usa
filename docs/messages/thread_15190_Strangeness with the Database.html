I have seen a few of my postings on the finding and condition of <br/>
boxes in CA disappear. Granted, the one of Driftwood by the Sea might <br/>
have been erased by Don and Gwen; however, the one I posted on <br/>
Folgrim (Redwall series) should not have been.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else having this problem? Is someone taking it upon <br/>
themselves to erase our posts to the base?<br/>

<br/>
My posting regarding a box in Indiana has also disappeared.  Perhaps <br/>
the placer (Hoosier Honeybee) removed it.  I don't know as she has <br/>
not responded to the status report that I sent directly to her.<br/>
