<br/>
I just found another great place to hide a few letterboxes, but lately<br/>
I've been feeling a little hesitant about getting the boxes in place<br/>
because it's on conservation land.  For those of you who've asked<br/>
permission to place letterboxes in parks or other conservation land,<br/>
how did you go about doing it?  I have a contact name, but I'm not<br/>
sure how to approach them.<br/>

I had to introduce several park, DEP and State Forest ,and Army corp <br/>
Engineers Reps to letterboxing the othernight. I sure was nervous <br/>
about leaving the right  impression. I went with something like this. <br/>
Letterboxing is a great activity , like following Captain Kidds <br/>
treasure map, it gets families out together, kids up away from tv and <br/>
outdoors READING AND FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS!  It teaches <br/>
reading ,writing , and compass skills it points out natural landmarks <br/>
for identifying ( rocks, plants trees, kettle hole,  glacial erratics)<br/>
Clues sometimes include historic signifigance, or whimsical  <br/>
features, some quote famous literature. There is an  outlet to be <br/>
creative with stamp carving and lots of physical exercise. Mostly it <br/>
is a fun inexpensive way to enjoy a day in a park.   They were very <br/>
receptive. They only asked if I was marking trees with surveyor tape <br/>
and I said not at all- our clues are more natural or trail markers <br/>
etc.  Guess someone has been marking trees in Mansfield Hollow. <br/>
   The meeting I was at was Friends of Mansfield Hollow , a new <br/>
support, promotion and  maintenence group. Present were those above <br/>
and canoe /kayak club, bikers , Applachian Mountain grp, fishing <br/>
enthusiasts, frisbee golf folks, etc. I was there as letterboxing rep <br/>
and  am now a director. More meetings..... I too remain torn between <br/>
the asking and not asking  - Good Luck    Leader of the Pack -Carol<br/>

<vbg>!!  WELL, you not only convinced them that letterboxing is a good<br/>
thing, but that you are leader.  Way to go!  We need friends in high places.<br/>
<s> Hope you enjoy the new hat.<br/>

Wow, that sounds great, Carol!  I wish I had the nerve to go up in
front of a group like that.  I have this feeling that if I tried,
I'd make them want nothing to do at all with letterboxing because I'd probably
be choosing all the wrong words out of nervousness.  But one on one
I think I'll do okay.  I'll think more about what I'm going to say
when I ask permission.  Thanks for giving me some info already!
