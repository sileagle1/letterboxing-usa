A. nab 3 nifty letterboxes, on the eve of their retirement,<br/>
B. help the NPS tidy up their visitor center, and<br/>
3. save western civilization from eminent demise.<br/>
As you may know, the Channel Islands letterboxes (2 planted by Don &amp; <br/>
Gwen Jackson, &amp; 1 by me) have been removed by the NPS.  I had <br/>
arranged to pick them all up yesterday, but when I got there, none of <br/>
the staff knew where the boxes had been put.  Leave it to the federal <br/>
government to FIND 3 letterboxes, remove them, &amp; then LOSE them in <br/>
their own office...<br/>
Anyway, the superintendent is a real likeable chap, &amp; has given me <br/>
the EXACT location at the visitor center where the boxes are being <br/>
kept, so I can tell the staff where to look next time I go back.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I'm off to a photo shoot, &amp; the Jacksons are too far <br/>
from Ventura to go get the stuff.<br/>
If anyone is interested in going to the Channel Islands NP visitor <br/>
center in Ventura, contact the Jacksons or myself, ASAP!  You can <br/>
give our beloved island boxes one last hurrah, &amp; increase your P <br/>
count by 3.  Such a deal.<br/>
