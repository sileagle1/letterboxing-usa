trail names depending on their mood, or who they are boxing with.  For<br/>
example, many groups might box as a Team something, and the individuals also<br/>
have  individual stamps they use when not in that particular group  (Did<br/>
that make any sense??)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My best boxing friend and I are contemplating developing a stamp to use when<br/>
the two of us are out together and she is thinking about changing as the<br/>
inspiration for her  stamp (her dog) recently passed.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many people change  stamps for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your trail name doesn't fit you anymore, find one that does.  OR two or<br/>
three if ya want!  <br/>

After it was discovered that he had a natural talent for finding boxes<br/>
without directions, Lascivious Lion's name changed his trail name to Box<br/>
Hound.  While it does not have the alliterative quality that all the<br/>
other Alphabet Bandits names contain, it does suit him quite well, but<br/>
then again I thought Lascivious Lion apropos ;)<br/>
