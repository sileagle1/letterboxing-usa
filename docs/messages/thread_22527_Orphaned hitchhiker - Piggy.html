                    <div class="plaintext-content">I received a hitchhiker which is an image of a pig (I think) with the <br/>
following message in its logbook: "The piggy is an orphaned <br/>
hitchhiker.  It was found in Great Pond State Park in CT (Box #2 of <br/>
Three Furry Friends Series) on 3/Oct/04.  There was no book, pad or <br/>
bag.  We've sent it on its way again.  MDR/Ridge, NY"<br/>
<br/>
It visited a few boxes, then got picked up and put in a postal <br/>
letterbox.  I will continue to circulate this, but wondered if anybody <br/>
recognizes it.  Any "parents" out there for this orphaned piggy?  I <br/>
could add your info to the logbook.<br/>
