<div>I visited the "Pleasant Valley" letterbox (Lyme, 
CT) on Saturday and found three stamps inside instead of one.  A frog stamp 
and a spiral stamp, along with an inkpad, were in their own plastic 
baggie.  It looked like someone left them behind by accident.  Or is 
this something new I don't know about??</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yesterday, while following the "Gnomelette" 
children's letterbox series in Lyme, we found an extra stamp in the box by the 
old mill site.  Along with the "official" stamp there was a cute 
kitty/pumpkin stamp.  Is this also someone's personal stamp that got left 
behind?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sorry if I messed anything up by giving away 
info... but these stamps appeared to be separated from their owners.  I 
don't think they were hitchhikers because they didn't have their own 
box.</div>
