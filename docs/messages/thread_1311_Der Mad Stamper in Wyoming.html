<br/>
The "Li'l Bug's Bungalow" Letterbox was placed on Expedition Island in Green <br/>
River, Wyoming on 9/30/2000.<br/>
<br/>
Just off I-80, Green River is a great place to start exploring the Flaming <br/>
Gorge National Recreation Area.<br/>

    I remember what a joke we thought it was back in 1998 when we began<br/>
this wonderful journey - sometimes dreams might come true.<br/>
<br/>
    Everyone needs to remember a friend OR Acquaintance from the<br/>
remaining states and try to get them interested in letterboxing.  I<br/>
imagine many of you have discovered that even those close to you (family<br/>
&amp; friends) may hastily remove themselves from your zealous accountings<br/>
of hunts.  BUT, we must persevere and find a way.  As Squirrel has noted<br/>
- there a lots of nuts in the woods.  The challenge is in finding them.<br/>
