<div>THE DRAGONFLY
LETTERBOX<br/>
Apple Valley Overlook<br/>
Ashfield, MA<br/>
<br/>
Placed April 21, 2002 by JLR &amp; Buckaroo<br/>
Distance: Less than 1 mile<br/>
Trail Difficulty: Relatively easy - a short uphill climb on a dirt
trail<br/>
<br/>
This is a beautiful spot, especially on a sunny day.  Perfect for
a picnic!<br/>
</div>
<div>Directions to
Apple Valley Overlook: From I-91 in western MA, take exit 18 and a
left off the ramp into Northampton.  Take a left at the big
traffic light onto Main Street/route 9.  Route 9 will take you
past Smith College, then through the towns of Williamsburg and
Goshen.  After you see signs for the D.A.R. State Forest, take a
right onto rte. 112 North.  Several miles down the road (a ways
after the elementary school) take a left on to Hawley Road. 
Continue on until you spot the familiar Trustees of the Reservation
sign on your left.  Park off the road just beyond this
sign.       </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Clue:  Bear
Swamp is on your left, look just up the road on your right to spot the
entrance to the Apple Valley Overlook trail.  Take this trail, be
sure to stay to the right at the fork.  Eventually you will come
to the clearing, the view is best enjoyed from the picnic table next
to a large tree.  With your back to this large tree, facing the
view, turn to the right until you spot a gnarled old tree and two
birch trees just beyond.  Standing near these birch trees, take
10 paces along the edge of the tree line.  Turn ever so slightly
to your right - the dragonfly is hiding at the base of a tree that
stands just in front of a large mass of rock. </div>
