It isn't Dartmoor... but this large, perhaps 100 acre, area of Riverstone Shopping Center just north of Publix and across from the <br/>
Post Office, will give you the challenge of finding a letterbox by triangulation. Pretend the piles of dirt are tors...listen <br/>
carefully...is that a hound???<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox Name: Triangulation One<br/>
<br/>
Location: Riverstone Shopping Center, on the north side of Canton, Cherokee County, GA. I-575 provides easy access to the <br/>
shopping area. If you are traveling north on I-575, get off at Exit 20 and turn left on Riverstone Parkway. You'll see Home <br/>
Depot on the right. The Post Office is behind Home Depot.<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: I'm not sure. Walking is easy, but I suppose the difficulty will be determined by the accuracy of your work and my <br/>
work with our compasses. :)<br/>

Clues:<br/>
<br/>
1. When you get to the area of the field, you can park in the Post Office parking spaces nearer to the field. There are also <br/>
places where the curb is cut to make turn-in's to the field. You could park in those if you wished.<br/>
<br/>
2. The letterbox is somewhere in the field, in a hole at ground level. Some debris is over the box to protect it from the elements, <br/>
and to hide it. Please replace it securely when you have finished exchanging stamp impression and logging comments. If there <br/>
are problems with the box, please let us know.<br/>
<br/>
3. When at the letterbox location, you will find the following azimuths...<br/>
<br/>
To the sign on the Post Office: 087 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Across the valley you will see blue letters, UAC, on a building, at least I think the second letter is an "A": 172 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
To the west there are two "old style" water tanks visible. The more southern tank is almost hidden by trees. The more northern <br/>
tank is at 238 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Toward the northwest, the traffic lights are at 303 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Use caution as you lift material to look under it. There are many black widow spiders under pieces of cardboard, scrap wood, <br/>
old tires, etc. in the field. Also, you see the field littered with the remains of fireworks that were set off for the July 4th <br/>
celebration.<br/>
<br/>
Please Note: The usual disclaimers apply: You are responsible for your own safety. Do not trespass on private property. Be <br/>
aware of animals, plants, and environmental situations that might put you, and others with you, in danger. It is a good policy to <br/>
wear brightly colored vests and caps in the woods during hunting seasons.<br/>
