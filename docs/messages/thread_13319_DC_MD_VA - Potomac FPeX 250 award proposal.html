<br/>
I propose a local award for boxing the area.  One, to reward local <br/>
efforts and Two, to reward those who place or exchange as much, or <br/>
more, than find: recognizing that it's all good.<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be grand to have a stamp for those who have a <br/>
combined FPeX 250, (Found, Placed, event, eXchanged) of all Potomac <br/>
River area stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I propose a map stamp in five parts: DC, NernVAsouth, NernVAwest, <br/>
MDnorth, and MDeast.  I suggest an emphasis on water, mountains and <br/>
parks rather than borders and roads.  Each stamp could be made by <br/>
someone different.  Those who make Potomac FPeX 250 could stamp the <br/>
stamps at gatherings or through the mail.  Just maybe it would be a <br/>
cool stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Any comments?<br/>
