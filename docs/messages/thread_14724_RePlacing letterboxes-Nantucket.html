Nantucket is my favorite place on earth. I've visited 20 times in 25 years. <br/>
Even bought a house there once in hope of making it a permanent home. Alas, my <br/>
hubby who works for the state of Calif., wouldn't hear of giving up his <br/>
pension. When he retires at 55, I'm sure I'll think that was a good idea. (I sold <br/>
the house for a tidy profit 2 years ago, alas. He promises someday to buy <br/>
another but I don't know if that will be possible with the prices going the way they <br/>
are, but I digress. . .)<br/>
<br/>
See those "A"s in my PFX count? They stand for "Attempted". I made that <br/>
letter up after looking for all the boxes on Nantucket in September of 2002 and <br/>
finding they were all trashed. The problem was, they were all placed in areas <br/>
where the high schoolers go at night! Sankety, Altar Rock, Brandt Point etc. VERY <br/>
frustrating to bike out to all those places and get NOTHING. So, I invented <br/>
the "A" so I'd get something.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I did not plant one in Nantucket. Had one ready and took part in <br/>
too many other things then never got the chance before we were off on the ferry. <br/>
I'll get back there again and be sure to find a great place, probably at the <br/>
old cemetery off in the bushes to the west. (Cemetery 'hunting' was always our <br/>
favorite sport on the island.)<br/>
<br/>
If you plant one, let me know. I'd love to visit vicariously!<br/>
P.S. Do you know Suzanne Reed? Great friend of mine. How about Sue Walton?<br/>
