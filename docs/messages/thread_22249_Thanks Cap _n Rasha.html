If you do not have the privelage of knowing Cap'n Rasha then you are <br/>
missing truly great people.  The other day I received a yellow mailer <br/>
and saw that it was from Cap 'n Rasha.  I assumed it was a letterbox <br/>
and immediately opened it.  Inside was a absolutely gorgeous lady bug <br/>
pin in the shape of a heart with hearts for the spots on her back.  <br/>
This is almost identical to my signature stamp, Texasluvbug.  Also a <br/>
note with their family of stamps was included that stated that she had <br/>
been out shopping and saw this pin and it reminded her of my stamp <br/>
that she had recently seen in a PLB logbook.  I was actually kinda <br/>
having a bad day so this actually made my whole year.  Thank you <br/>
Cap 'n Rasha for such an awesome, thoughtful gesture.  I absolutely <br/>
love it.  Ya'll are just super great folks.<br/>
<br/>
Once again Thank You,<br/>
Texasluvbug<br/>
