<br/>
We just joined and have found 4 letterboxes so far!!! How exciting!! <br/>
We learned about it from our friends who are visiting in Las Vegas <br/>
right now and have been having fun with it over there. After <br/>
listening to their enthusiasm about it we have decided to give it a <br/>
try as well. I thought it'd be fun to find some here before they get <br/>
back and find them!! They don't know which ones we've found yet...LOL<br/>
<br/>
So far its mostly my children and I, but maybe my hubby will change <br/>
his mind after a few *finds* of his own! He did find one and admitted <br/>
it was rather exciting when he found it first.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a nice thanksgiving day today  :)<br/>

To the new ones in Caldwell, I am so excited to finally have <br/>
some other letterboxers in ID.  You are just going to love it, and <br/>
you are so lucky to have A-bear in your area.  She is great!  Just <br/>
keep boxing, and if you have any friends on my side of the state <br/>
(East) feel free to hook them too.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
enjoy!<br/>
Cadenza<br/>

I am so happy our friends have told us about this hobby because it is <br/>
sooo exciting!! Especially since I LOVE rubberstamping too. I find <br/>
myself now day dreaming about letterboxing and wanting to find some <br/>
more before it snows (like you are experiencing right now A-<br/>
bear)...frustrating!!<br/>
<br/>
I have been mentally trying to figure out where I want to put some <br/>
letterboxes. I really liked some of your clues A-bear and I want my <br/>
clues to be good too. I know when our friends get back they will be <br/>
pretty creative with their clues...perhaps too creative??!! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Cadenza, I will try to talk some of our friends who live in Central <br/>
Idaho into checking it out. We do have quite a few over there. We <br/>
also travel thru your area a couple of times per year. Will try to <br/>
plant a few when we come thru next year as well as find some of yours!<br/>
<br/>
Doc and Hanna...if you're reading this...hurry and get home so we can <br/>
go letterboxing together!! ps don't worry...I won't let Big Ron place <br/>
a letterbox on your property like he wants to!!!<br/>
