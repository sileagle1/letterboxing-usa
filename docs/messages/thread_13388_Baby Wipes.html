Wouldn't detergent have the same 'scent' drawback as baby wipes?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Dye inks clean up much<br/>
&gt; easier - the best way to clean up after pigment ink is with a toothbrush,<br/>
&gt; dish detergent and running water, especially with intricate stamps.  We're<br/>
&gt; considering carrying an old tooth brush loaded with a little detergent,<br/>
&gt; then using our drinking water bottle to rinse stamps off.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I don't think so, as you'd be using a really small amount and wash it <br/>
away (the wipes solution stays of the stamp) - but I've used unscented soap <br/>
products for so long due to allergies I've forgotten there's any other kind!<br/>
<br/>
Our area doesn't see the letterboxing traffic that seems to occur in the <br/>
New England states - after seeing what some of the local stamps look like <br/>
after a few dozen visitors, I was wondering what the experiences of New <br/>
Englanders are - do the stamps get really gummy, do people generally clean <br/>
them after use,  are there any cleaning tips you could share, or is this <br/>
not even an issue?<br/>
