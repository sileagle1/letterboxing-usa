Little Asta is staying home with Weezee.  Guitarzan and I hope to<br/>
drive along the BR PArkway, weather permitting, and box along the way.<br/>
 Not sure if there are any readily accessible LBs????  <br/>
We will visit a new grandbaby in Oklahoma (Norman) and then on to<br/>
Guitarzan's Mom's house in Onalaska near Houston.  We will have time<br/>
to box in Texas, Mom-in-law is quite keen to do little hikes and box<br/>
with us.  Any tips very much appreciated and we'd love to meet up with<br/>
any interested boxers...   Nor<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Nor, no info on the Blue Ridge Parkway, but once you're down here,<br/>
I think you'll love the letterboxes that have sprung up in Cold Spring<br/>
(just the other side of Lake Livingston), thanks to BootsTex &amp; Lone<br/>
Star Quilter.  <br/>
<br/>
Double Lake Recreation area is very nice place for a short hike, as is<br/>
Cagle Recreation area.  <br/>
<br/>
Will give you more specific directions as you need them, but give me a<br/>
shout if you're going to make it down into the Houston area itself.<br/>
