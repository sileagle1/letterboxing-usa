Dartmoor" letterbox is alive and well in the Pacific Northwest!   <br/>
I was inspired last night and finally figured out this cryptic box---<br/>
so I had to run right out today and get the stamp!<br/>
<br/>
And it is a gorgeous stamp too!!  Thanks to Der Mad Stamper.  I had a <br/>
wonderful time hunting for this box.  And I was only the 2nd person <br/>
to stamp-in (and Ryan C. wasn't the first, I was shocked!)<br/>

*chuckle*  Well, I haven't had a chance to find ALL of them... yet.  <br/>
I'm still working on it, though!  I'll get to that box eventually.  <br/>
Hmmm, perhaps I should figure out where it is first, so if I'm in the <br/>
area of it I'm sure not to miss it!<br/>
