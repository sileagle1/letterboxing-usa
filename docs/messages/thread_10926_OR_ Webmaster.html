I was just noticing that the Oregon Salem/Eugene list of letterboxes <br/>
looks like it has recently been updated, but that the Minto Brown <br/>
letterbox never made it on the list.  Here is the original message <br/>
with the link for that letterbox:<br/>
<br/>
Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
The weekend was a bit crisp and chilly, however, Barry and I managed <br/>
to get out and plant a letterbox in Salem. It's based off picture <br/>
clues so it may be a bit tricky :)<br/>
<br/>
It is located in:<br/>
<br/>
Salem, Oregon <br/>
Marion County <br/>
and it's titled "Minto Brown Island" (although it isn't really an <br/>
island).<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link to the clue: <br/>

Happy Boxing!<br/>
