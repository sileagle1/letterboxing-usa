Thanks to Thom and others for the compliments. Blackpoint is one of <br/>
my favorite places in Florida. The winter is especially good as the <br/>
migratory bird population often exceeds 100,000 at the peak and over <br/>
300 different species of birds have been seen in the refuge. Hawks <br/>
and Eagles are common. It is also excellent backcountry saltwater <br/>
fishing. This is just the beginning of the season and hopefully I <br/>
will get a lot more pictures out there.<br/>
<br/>
  As for snakes, we have no shortage (venomous or otherwise). The only <br/>
ones that really concern me are the rattlers, they are aggressive and <br/>
very dangerous. The others generally don't attack unless you <br/>
accidently (or puposefully) disturb them and they can't easily <br/>
retreat. That is why I would always use a stick to retrieve any <br/>
letterbox placed on the ground down here unless it is  in the open. I <br/>
was within about 2 to 3 feet of the snake I photographed and not much <br/>
concerned as he seemed quite content. He will probably soon have a <br/>
letterbox dedicated to his likeness placed on that trail :-)<br/>
