                    <html><body>Mary and I got a chance to check on these boxes today.  What a beautiful day to hike!   If I do say so myself, the 3 hour circut is one of the better ones in the area.......  beautiful view points, 2 lakes, mountain laurel in bloom and 3 letterboxes........ what more could you ask for?  :)
<br/>
<br/>Anyway, boxes 1 and 3 are both in good shape and we replaced # 2.  We could find no trace of the old one (Vernon did say he removed the remains of the box he found.  Thanks, again, Vernon.) and we saw no reason not to put the new one back in the same place as before   ........ so we did.
<br/>
<br/>We placed Harriman Tracks #4 in a very different type location and hope to do more in other areas of the Park in the future.
