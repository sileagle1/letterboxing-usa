Wanda recently went looking for the Wadsworth Falls Park<br/>
boxes and found Big Laurel missing.  After hiking the loop<br/>
to the falls (a great photo site) and back she went to use the<br/>
telephone and there on a nearby picnic table was an unattended<br/>
tupperware box - Big Laurel, intact and ready to go home!<br/>
<br/>
We have located dozens of other boxes in CT, RI and nearby MA over<br/>
the last three months with great enthusiasm and only occasional difficulty<br/>
and have come up empty handed only 3 times:<br/>
<br/>
    Avery Memorial in CT and Stepping Stone in RI are missing; they<br/>
    are no longer at home where we found them earlier.<br/>
<br/>
    Devil's Hopyard #2 in CT also seems missing as all we found under<br/>
    a likely 4x6 rock were leaves and acorn shucks.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen these 3 boxes in the last few weeks?<br/>
<br/>
Moose on the Loose was found Friday hitching a ride at Wilcox Park<br/>
in RI.  It has joined us for awhile in search of greener pastures!<br/>
<br/>
Palantir was found at Bear Cave on April 27th and is now residing at a<br/>
new lookout spot in another state.<br/>

some fact finding, since, it is my church as well.<br/>

PS- "Walk in Whitehall" has been repaired, or did I mention this already?<br/>
