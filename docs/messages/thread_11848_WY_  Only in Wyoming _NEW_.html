Placed by A-Bear on 10 Apr 03<br/>
Fort Bridger, Wyoming<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From I-80 take Exit 34 and follow signs<br/>
to Ft Bridger Historical Site which is south about 3<br/>
miles.  Turn right into the Fort Bridger Historical<br/>
Site (cost is $2 and it's open from 0900 until dusk).<br/>
<br/>
Trail:  Easy and flat about .5 miles.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Some people thought George McLean was crazy<br/>
back in 1829 when he described to others what he had<br/>
seen on the high plains of Wyoming.  As a result, he<br/>
left these clues to prove to others that this<br/>
Jackalope does still exist although almost extinct. <br/>
Since the Jackalope is known for mimicing humand<br/>
sounds Mr. McLean recommends you start your search in<br/>
the Band Stand. Write down the date of dedication July<br/>
____,19____.  Continue west across the bridge.  Head<br/>
north on the dirt path to "Ft Bridger in 1889." <br/>
Proceed south on the road to the New Courthouse. <br/>
Continue on the trail that passes the Sentry Box.  At<br/>
the bone cross head north to the Bridger's Old Fort. <br/>
Cross the first bridge and stop at the first gate into<br/>
Bridger's Stockade (closest to the wagon).  Head (the<br/>
year the band stand was dedicated minus 1908) degrees<br/>
for (day of the month the band stand was dedicated<br/>
times 10) paces.   Under the south western end stands<br/>
George McLean's Jackalope.<br/>
