 While this may be a quick question, I believe the answer can even <br/>
be quicker. Delete the clue and let the finder write in their <br/>
logbook what their F count is.<br/>
I realize that this concept is fairly unpopular with many <br/>
letterboxers, but considering the space the clue takes up, why <br/>
should this practice be continued?<br/>
With the current practice of registering Fs on the site, then the <br/>
number of clue sheets with no letterboxes can only increase over <br/>
time. This was originally a site that held clues to letterboxes not <br/>
a site to register your finds.<br/>
I realize that this topic has been hashed over, but maybe it is time <br/>
to rehash it. Or maybe a poll should be considered?<br/>

<br/>
I'd much rather see the clues taken off the site and then reposted once the<br/>
box has been replaced.<br/>
<br/>
If the box is missing, many placers indicate that at the beginning of the<br/>
clues, but few placers actually put that in the title of the box so that it<br/>
can be seen without opening up the clues.<br/>
<br/>
If the boxes *are* going to remain on LbNA, which I'm not in favor of, but<br/>
if they *are*, it would be really nice if placers put "RETIRED" or "MISSING"<br/>
right at the beginning of the name of the box.  That can then be removed if<br/>
a missing box is replaced or a retired box is brought back out of<br/>
retirement.<br/>
