planted 12/30/02 by Waterbird. This is a small, nearly mini-, box.<br/>
Difficulty: easy. <br/>
On I-495 take exit 46 onto eastbound Rte. 123 (Dolley Madison Blvd/Chain <br/>
Bridge Rd). Take the first left after the light at Old Dominion Drive onto <br/>
Ingleside Avenue and go to the library, the first public building on the left. Park <br/>
at the bottom of the library lotl. Note the signs pointing to McLean Green and <br/>
to tennis/basketball/playground. Follow the paved path toward the latter. <br/>
When you come to a junction of paved paths, follow the one that goes on a <br/>
bearing of 288 degrees. In less than half a minute you will find a bench on the <br/>
right. Go 33 paces (not steps) on the path to a downed, rotting tree angling off <br/>
to the right of the path. Puddle Duck is tucked under the log on the near side <br/>
opposite a tall, slender, vine-covered tree on the right.<br/>
