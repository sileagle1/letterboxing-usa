Yesterday as AshRaven and Sir Balthazar and I were retrieving the <br/>
last of our stamps hidden in Meadow Park for the event, we took a <br/>
quiet moment to look through the logbooks to learn who had found <br/>
which boxes.  Of course, Doublesaj and Old Blue were part of that <br/>
ruthless team who joined forces and insisted on finding ALL of them.  <br/>
I was very pleased when I looked through the book from my Yes on <br/>
Cheeseracing box and saw that D.S. had penned next to her stamped <br/>
archery design a small, (but SINCERE seeming) pro-cheeseracing <br/>
sentiment.  Pleased, at least, until I happened to see what she had <br/>
penned in Sir Balthazar's anti-cheeseracing book!!!! <br/>
<br/>
This is a woman so unafraid to take a stand that she will take <br/>
several mutually exclusive stands on the very same afternoon, with <br/>
seeming conviction!  It is this kind of moral uncertainty that I am <br/>
taking exception to as I state that while she, at her last report, <br/>
had 130 finds, I went out purposely yesterday for Buzzard's wonderful <br/>
Halloween Box so that I no longer have to share that figure with her: <br/>
131 for me, Doublesaj- take THAT!<br/>

(who actually really likes being around Doublesaj and Old Blue- they <br/>
are both very gracious and fun.)  <br/>
(P.S.  Doublesaj, while you were here, did you by any chance leave <br/>
behind something plastic of an important financial nature in any <br/>
local business while you were in town?)<br/>
