 This is a very original series based upon a stroll taken by  <br/>
Thoreau, Emerson and Longfellow.  It also struck me personally as it <br/>
is in honor of an English teacher who taught at the school I work <br/>
in.  Her family donated the property for this open land trust. <br/>
  I totally enjoyed my buggy walk there today, and was successful in <br/>
finding #1, #3 and #4.  Box #2 eluded me, though it had been found in <br/>
mid-June so it's present, just hiding from me. I shall return!<br/>
