                    <div class="plaintext-content">May 7th, I plan on going to White Sands and doing a clean up. While <br/>
doing a check up on my box, I happened to notice that the area is <br/>
trashed. What I am hoping is that I can get a bunch of people in the <br/>
letterboxing world. So far I have had 1 person ask about this project <br/>
and this evening, I am going to the town meeting to talk about my <br/>
efforts tonight. I wasn't going to expose the location of white sands <br/>
until I had enough volunteers, so come on guys. 2 weeks to go.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to my boss and discussed donating pizza and trash bags.<br/>
I plan on carving a special stamp for Project White Sands, for those<br/>
who come and join my efforts. There are also many boxes within 20<br/>
miles of White Sands.<br/>
<br/>
All the help and will be greatfully appreciated.<br/>
