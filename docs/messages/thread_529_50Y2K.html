<br/>
No Utah boxes just yet, but if I manage it this summer (which I am hoping<br/>
to do with the help of my brother and sister-in-law in Utah) I'll be sure<br/>
to post clues.  The box will probably be in Rock Canyon which is Provo,<br/>
Utah or maybe a (if my relatives are feeling particularly vigorous) along<br/>
the hiking trail to Mt Timpanogos.  Both of these are south of SLC and, if<br/>
you're driving from SLC to Lake Powell, not too far out of the way.  The<br/>
fact that someone is going to that area might give me the motivation I need<br/>
to make this happen.  I'll let you know!<br/>

&gt; &gt;  It kind of looks like I may be going to Utah this August for about a week<br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt; &gt;  so.  Will be flying into Salt Lake city and camping at Lake Powell.  I've<br/>
&gt; &gt;  never been out there but my friend has, so I don;t know the area.  But if<br/>
&gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt;  letterboxes will be or are placed out there, I would like to try to find<br/>
&gt;them.<br/>

I think we are going to drive from TN to Utah  for a one week plus a day or <br/>
so, if I can talk the boss into letting me leave for that long. (I know, we <br/>
are crazy!!!)  This way we will have a car to explore when and where we want. <br/>
 Plus, I have never been past Ames Iowa.  So this will be an exploration trip <br/>
for me!!!  ummm. . . kindof sounds familar . . .  weren't there other <br/>
explorers who traveled west of the Mississippi to find new lands??!! <wink <br="">
wink&gt;<br/>
We are going to meet others at Lake Powell. For camping and boating.. . <br/>
exploring and hopefully letterboxing!!!!  I'll post the trip itinerary as <br/>
soon as it is final and maybe others will clue me in on to some boxes along <br/>
the way!<br/>
Becky<br/>
