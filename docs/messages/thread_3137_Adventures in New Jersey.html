                    <div class="plaintext-content">My good buddy David and I just got back from our annual "baseball frenzy" <br/>
roadtrip, during which we drove some 600 miles from Connecticut to New York <br/>
and New Jersey and back again, saw four minor league baseball games in three <br/>
days (in Newark, Lakewood and Trenton, NJ, and Staten Island, NY) and ate <br/>
breakfast at two first-rate diners (Harris Diner in East Orange, NJ and <br/>
Roadside Diner in Wall, NJ). This year, for the first time, we made <br/>
letterboxing part of our itinerary.<br/>
<br/>
Traveling from Newark to Lakewood on Saturday, we stopped along the way to <br/>
hunt for two boxes. The first, MartianMaggot's letterbox at Kennedy Park in <br/>
Sayreville, NJ, completely eluded us. Although the clues are brief and the <br/>
hike simple, we were nevertheless unsuccessful in finding it (despite <br/>
spending a good deal of time poking around nearly every "double pine tree" in <br/>
the place). Our disappointment was short-lived when we sought out and found <br/>
the second box of the day, the "Crabbing Bridge" letterbox at Cheesequake <br/>
State Park. An interesting hike and a very nice stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Two mystery boxes placed by New Jersey's Perfect Circle Letterboxing Guild <br/>
(which, BTW, has a terrific website) awaited us on Sunday. First up was <br/>
"Panic/Attack"; we were in the right town, in the right park, at the right <br/>
monument (worth the visit alone), but were unable to locate this box! After <br/>
scouring its resting spot (unmistakable from the clues), we reached the sad <br/>
conclusion that this letterbox must be missing from its perch. Perhaps <br/>
someone from PCLG can confirm whether or not this box is still in place. <br/>
Disappointed but undeterred, we headed to another, final resting place and <br/>
easily found the "Mooving Tale" letterbox. After wiping a tear or two from <br/>
our eyes, we stamped in and then proceeded on our way.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, we had another excellent roadtrip, made even more enjoyable by <br/>
those Jersey letterboxes. Many thanks to the "Jersey girls" and "Jersey boys" <br/>
who planted 'em!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll go over and confirm that the box is missing (I'm not surprised <br/>
it's finally gone...). This was the first box that we had planted, and <br/>
afterwards it seemed to us that we didn't hide it very well. So, we <br/>
kept checking it every few weeks and it was always right where <br/>
we planted it, so we assumed (incorrectly) that if people found it <br/>
by accident, they were being good sports and replacing it to its <br/>
hiding spot. But, all good things must come to an end.... I'll make <br/>
the changes on the website in the next day or two (it's far too late <br/>
tonight, and my eyes are getting droopy...).<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking I won't replace that box--it'll be like those collectibles <br/>
that are available "for a limited time only!" So, if you have the <br/>
stamp already, keep it in a safe place; it might be worth money <br/>
someday! :) But, in it's place, we're planning on hiding a few new <br/>
boxes in the next month, as we're thinking of having a third group <br/>
expedition some time when the weather cools down a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the update on this box. If anyone else has found <br/>
anything amiss with our other boxes, please let me know. We try <br/>
to check on them periodically, but managing these boxes all over <br/>
the state is like babysitting a bunch of unruly children--you never <br/>
know what sort of trouble they're going to get into!<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we have some boxes on our website (#7-12, to be <br/>
exact) which haven't yet been officially posted to the LBNA <br/>
website, as we like to make sure the clues are error-free before <br/>
we post them. They should be made official and posted to the <br/>
LBNA site some time soon, when it's confirmed that they have <br/>
indeed been found. I've been meaning to drive over to some of <br/>
them to check, but we've been getting sidetracked recently (by <br/>
way of the Sourland Preserve, Ken Lockwood Gorge, Turkey <br/>
Mountain, the Tourne, ... Excellent adventures, all!).<br/>
