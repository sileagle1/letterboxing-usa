letterboxing activity at the Postal Museum in DC today. It was <br/>
wonderful to put a face to stamps and names I have seen here, in log <br/>
books, and in clues for boxes. Don't you wish some boxes were as easy <br/>
as today's? But to be honest, half the fun is digging in the dirt or <br/>
scrambling through rocks or green briar! <br/>
I hope to see you out on the trail or at the VA (metro DC) <br/>
letterboxing gathering when ever it happens!<br/>
