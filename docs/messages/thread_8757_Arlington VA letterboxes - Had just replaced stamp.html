<br/>
Was the old boiler out of the water much?  When I saw it after the <br/>
rains you could only see 5 rivets of it sticking up like fingertips <br/>
into the current.<br/>
<br/>
The question is do you think the Old Boiler stamp location needs a <br/>
log journal?  I was afraid it would be stolen so all I left was the <br/>
stamp and a note.<br/>

&gt; A word of caution to all of you attempting Old Boiler -- it is <br/>
&gt; diabolical!  Clambering over scary rocks and down "cliffs" that, of <br/>
&gt; course, had to be climbed up on the way back.  Mountain goats <br/>
&gt; wouldn't even have chosen that path.  It is most difficult terrain <br/>
&gt; yet.  I loved it!<br/>

&gt; &gt; The following are all still there -<br/>

&gt; &gt; Gulf Branch/Old Boiler - That waterfall area is beautiful!  Even <br/>

&gt; &gt; Inligua - there, but is in need of a new box.  Looks like it's <br/>
been <br/>
&gt; &gt; chewed through.  Replaced the ziplog bags with new ones, but <br/>
didn't <br/>
&gt; &gt; have a spare box.  <br/>

Definately a journal!  I love reading other peoples comments and <br/>
would love to see what they would have said getting to this one!  Oh <br/>
no...but that would mean I'd have to go back to stamp in! drat.  : )  <br/>
