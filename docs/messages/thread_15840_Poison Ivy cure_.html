Should you be exposed to poison ivy, there is nearly always one or both of these plant growing nearby...<br/>
<br/>
To see pictures of jewel weed you can go here - http://plants.usda.gov/<br/>
<br/>
Jewel Weed (impatiens capensis) - When in flower, this plant is very recognizable by it's pretty, unique flowers<br/>
<br/>
Plantain (sorry, I don't know the latin name for this one!) grows everywhere!  It's close to the ground and can have either fat or narrow leaves.  All the leaves grow out from a hidden middle.  It's leaves are distinctive in the three grooves that run nearly it's entire length.  When it's in flower, it has a tall skinny stalk that may have tiny flowers on it growing from the center.<br/>
<br/>
For either of these plants, pick several leaves, enough so you can make sure their juice covers all the ivy exposed skin.  Bruise the leaves well and rub them thoroughly over the exposed area.  The properties in both these plants stops the poison ivy in it's tracks!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those in the southern New England area, Jewelweed (also called <br/>
Touch-me-not because of its seed pods that burst open when you touch them) is in bloom <br/>
now. The flower has an orchid look about it and its flowers are yellow with <br/>
tiny orangy-brown speckles, and the stems are rather succulent. If in doubt, dunk <br/>
the leaves into water and they will look silvery, thus the name Jewelweed.<br/>
<br/>
Jewelweed is a much more effective preventative to getting the rash (once you <br/>
know you;ve touched poison ivy) than Plantain is. Plantain is great for the <br/>
itching of mosquito bites and the itchy rash of P/I but it won't prevent the <br/>
rash.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget also that you can get poison ivy any time of year - even after <br/>
the leaves have dropped.<br/>

Thanks for any advice on handling Poison Oak (Ivy); I'm a magnet for <br/>
it, and have had two recent bouts brought on by letterboxing.  I'll <br/>
try your ointments, and I do agree: this stuff spreads by itself for <br/>
no reason!!  I went to the doctor for it and he just shrugged and <br/>
said apply some benadryl.  No shots for me--rotten rat-weasel <br/>

really dangerous stuff. It can grow up almost overnight. Boxes I have <br/>
placed in some areas that were clear now have poison oak growing all <br/>

<br/>
There are shots that you can get which will make you immune to it. <br/>
The three shot series requires you not be recently suffering from it <br/>
at the time. It gives one at least one year of being symptom-free.<br/>
<br/>
Another plant that may be used for first aid is mugwort. The leaves <br/>
are very sticky and, like tape, may pull the oils right off the skin. <br/>
Mugwort tends to grow near poison oak, proving once again that where <br/>
Nature gives a poison, it also gives a cure.<br/>
<br/>
Equal parts of myrrh, goldenseal, and cayanne suspended in alcohol is <br/>
also good as a topical soothing and drying agent. <br/>
<br/>
With all of that, I think the shots are the best deal if you can find <br/>
a doctor who will give them to you. They do burn a tad going in, but <br/>
sometimes it is very much worth it.<br/>

I had this shot, given sometime in late winter or early spring, after a horrendous outbreak the previous year.  I haven't asked about the shot in quite a few years, but wish I had.  I have patches all over me this year, and don't know how the oil is still being spread.  I was not in or near p-ivy in 2 weeks, yet new patches have come out.  I know I have a slow metabolism, but sheesh.  I wore long pants and a sweatshirt , and have patches of ivy rash in places that were covered. Some of those are pretty strange places, so that leads me to believe that a washcloth or the laundry has moved the plant oil all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
Someone else mentioned Technu.  It seems to work very well to clean the oil off your skin if you know that you have come in contact with it.  I am highly sensitive to oak and ivy, and after accidentally putting my hand through a thick clump of it, I washed with Technu.  No reaction.<br/>
