                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings from Maine...  I just discovered letterboxing a couple of<br/>
weeks ago.  I grabbed my husband and a friend and off we trekked, with<br/>
our brand-new stamps, across a swinging bridge toward our first box.  My<br/>
friend and I were shreekingly (a word?) delighted when my husband rolled<br/>
over the cement block.   It was dusk and we had almost given up--glad we<br/>
didn't!<br/>
Since then I've been checking the website and noticed the Kids Day<br/>
("big" kids) event at Rocky Neck.  I grew up in Niantic and we were<br/>
heading down to visit the family... So, I HAD to stop by... glad I did.<br/>
It was great to meet the group and exchange stamps.  Unfortunately I<br/>
couldn't stay to look for boxes--headed back up north.  Thanks to those<br/>
I spoke with for the personal introduction to letterboxing!<br/>

                    <html><body>I think RTRW, BBBunny and I were the LAST ones out of the park tonight.  We just HAD to get those last 2 boxes on the boardwalk.  It was DARK but BBBunny, good Scout that he is, had his flashlight along.  We managed to find the Egrets nest and the kitten in the pumpkin and headed home.  DH wasn't too happy with us!  BUT, a day like this only comes once a year and it was GREAT FUN.  <br/>
thanks to all who planted, organized, wrote clues and come to join in the fun.<br/>
BBBunny had a wonderful introduction to Lb and now it is his favorite hobby.  Thanks to Eagleboxer and his brother who led us on a 'mystery' hike to another box and talked Scouts a bit with the Bunny.<br/>
See you on the trails<br/>
