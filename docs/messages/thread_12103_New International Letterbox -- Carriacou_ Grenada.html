trip to the tiny (and I mean tiny) island of Carriacou, in the South <br/>
Carribean.  The link for the clue is at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/moloch515/carriacou.html<br/>
<br/>
Ryan may think he's the only Oregonian placing boxes in desolate, <br/>
remote locations like Africa, Mt. Defiance, and Jack-In-The-Box <br/>
restaurants.  This one may even be a bit more remote than his odd-<br/>
ball boxes!  I suspect that this box will decompose before anyone <br/>
actually makes the trip down there to nab it.  And I think I can say <br/>
with a great deal of confidence that there aren't many letterboxers <br/>
on the island of Carriacou!  <br/>

To be honest, I'm not sure.  It was my brother who went there and <br/>
planted this for me.  I know that Carriacou is part of Grenada, which <br/>
is just north of Venezuela.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We'll have to check it out sometime way into the future when we <br/>

That'd be awesome!  I planted not actually expecting anyone to find <br/>
it.  But if someonde actually did find it, I'd be tickled pink!<br/>
