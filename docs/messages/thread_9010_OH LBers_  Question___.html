<br/>
We will be heading to Cincinnati next week for a few days of not so <br/>
pleasant stuff and would like to look for some letterboxes near the <br/>
downtown area to help boost our spirits a bit.  As we won't have <br/>
much time to look, could you please recommend some quick, <br/>
interesting letterbox 'hunts' for us relatively close to downtown <br/>
Cincinnati?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you manyfold in advance!<br/>
