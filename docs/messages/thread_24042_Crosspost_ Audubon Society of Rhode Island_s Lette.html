<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just want to bring the lists up to date regarding letterboxing on Audubon<br/>
Society of Rhode Island properties.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We brought up the request by JAMO to place a box here at ASRI at the<br/>
Caratunk refuge, and the organization is upholding the policy prohibiting<br/>
letterboxing on our properties. Our properties are maintained for habitat<br/>
protection and possess a lot fragile habitats and species, and there is a<br/>
real concern about mitigating human impact and the ability to protect<br/>
sensitive areas .which is why the policy was put in place (nothing against<br/>
the hobby itself).  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, I'd like to ask folks to adhere to this policy and let other 'boxers who<br/>
may not monitor the list know about this policy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">As a non-RI resident, I do not have a personal investment one way or the<br/>
other in the RI Audubon's policy (although I am close to RI &amp; will likely<br/>
venture down there for LBing at some point). Their hearts are clearly in the<br/>
right place; however, I do think the decision is unfortunate. Letterboxers<br/>
often (probably more often than not) work discreetly, not seeking<br/>
permission, but taking the "risk" and hoping for the best. Don't ask, don't<br/>
tell, hope not to be discovered. Thus, letterboxers will plant. Whether in<br/>
spite of the policy (in every group of humans this big, there are "bad<br/>
apples") or in ignorance of the policy. If, however, the Audubon Society<br/>
openly &amp; "loudly" sanctioned letterboxing on it's properties, but maintained<br/>
supervisory control, then they can approve locations (and conversely reject<br/>
some locations), so they can keep boxes out of those sensitive areas (which<br/>
staff is much more likely to know of than random letterboxers). Although<br/>
nothing ever works perfectly, I believe this would be a far more effective<br/>
way to manage LBs on properties. The Sudbury Valley Trustees do this with<br/>
their properties.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a newbie, and this hadn't occurred to me initially, but I was talking<br/>
with a Mass Audubon staff member &amp; asked about LBing. (She said that one of<br/>
their staff members had just taken a Questing course, and they were making<br/>
plans to do a Quest on MA Audobon property; cool--I'm looking forward to<br/>
that!). She indicated that they really want LBers to consult with them about<br/>
planting boxes, b/c a box was planted on MA Audubon property in a place that<br/>
was a rattlesnake breeding area, posing threat to both the rattlesnakes and<br/>
the LBers. If the planter had consulted with the park management, this would<br/>
have been avoided.<br/>
<br/>
Just a different perspective on the same concern. Knowing now that RI<br/>
Audubon prohibits LBing, I would not, as a seeker, look for a box on their<br/>
properties. Perhaps this type of benefit outweighs the one I described<br/>
above.<br/>
