Granted that Ontario is huge, However our guidelinse for dividing<br/>
regions is based on number of boxes, not distance between letterboxes.<br/>
Ontario has 85 boxes on LbNA, which is a comfortable number for one<br/>
region. You might want to resort to the old fashioned approach of<br/>
putting a map of Ontario up on the wall and sticking pins in it to see<br/>
the relative locations of the letterboxes. <br/>
