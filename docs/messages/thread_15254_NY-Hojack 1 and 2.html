<br/>
Hojack 2 has new clues below:<br/>
<br/>
Hojack Trail #2 Second placement: July 17, 2003<br/>
Second on the Hojack trail <br/>
Difficulty-Due to the ice storm of '03 this once easily biked or <br/>
walked-RR grade trail has become almost impenetrable from this <br/>
direction. Long clothing and determination required.<br/>
In the summer, poison Ivy is common. <br/>
Not recommended for small children. <br/>
Use common sense. <br/>
<br/>
Continuing from Hojack Trail #1 cross Wiltsieville Road. <br/>
<br/>
A concrete pillar marks the entrance. A gentle curve turns you a <br/>
little more westerly to 280 d. The trail abruptly disappears under a <br/>
wall of apple tree branches that fill the narrow ravine.  The next  <br/>
mile or so of trail will consist of serious negotiating around the <br/>
unbelievable results of the ice storm. Hills rise slowly on either <br/>
side of you, as you cut through the hillside, first head high, then <br/>
towering overhead. You are walking through a canyon. You see another <br/>
gentle curve, again toward the west. You follow the curve until you <br/>
can see a change up a head. The path straightens abruptly and veers <br/>
northward resuming 300 d. <br/>
<br/>
The hills that had been towering over you disappear. Your level path <br/>
continues as the forest begins to drop away from you on either side. <br/>
Instead of walking through a valley you are now up on a causeway <br/>
making a ramrod straight run across the valley. The way is clear of <br/>
fallen trees. The causeway runs up to a narrow bridge crossing some <br/>
thirty feet over the water below. <br/>
<br/>
Hojack #2 is here:<br/>
<br/>
                    \ / <br/>
                    I I <br/>
                    I I <br/>
                    I I <br/>
               &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I I <br/>
                    I I<br/>
                    I I<br/>
                    / \<br/>
<br/>
The Hojack Trail intersects many roads on its way to Fair Haven.  <br/>
There are several overpasses.  You'll know you've found the right one <br/>
when you locate the box <br/>
