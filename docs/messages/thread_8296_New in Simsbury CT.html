&gt; &gt; This imaginary letter was found in an attic in the center of <br/>
Simsbury, <br/>
&gt; &gt; Connecticut near the Phelps Homestead and launched the search for <br/>
a relic <br/>
&gt; &gt; left behind in 1880 by Jeffery O. Phelps, Jr.  Perhaps if you <br/>
read it <br/>
&gt; &gt; carefully you may discover its location.  Begin at the Phelps <br/>
Tavern Museum <br/>
&gt; &gt; and Homestead, 800 Hopmeadow Street, Simsbury Connecticut 06070.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; May 19, 1880<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Dear Cousin,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You have asked me to describe Simsbury and the farm we live on <br/>
but so much <br/>
&gt; &gt; has changed I know not where to start.  When my father Jeffery O. <br/>
Phelps <br/>
&gt; &gt; and others dreamed of building a canal from New Haven to <br/>
Northampton <br/>
&gt; &gt; Massachusetts, they could never have imagined the coming of the <br/>
railroad.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Instead they saw water as the way to transport goods especially <br/>
the stones <br/>
&gt; &gt; that were quarried here in Simsbury. Now we have four train lines <br/>
passing <br/>
&gt; &gt; through town.  I myself worked as a conductor and stationmaster  <br/>
and lived <br/>
&gt; &gt; in the village of Tariffville almost thirty years ago.  It was <br/>
such an <br/>
&gt; &gt; exciting place with hotels, mills and music halls.  I was <br/>
determined not to <br/>
&gt; &gt; end up as a farmer.  But now that the farm is mine (Father passed <br/>
last <br/>
&gt; &gt; year) I find myself drawn to it on those week-ends when I can get <br/>
away from <br/>
&gt; &gt; the social whirl in Hartford.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Today, as I walked the property checking the barns and the cows <br/>
and horses <br/>
&gt; &gt; they hold, I imagined what it will be like in one hundred years <br/>
when my <br/>
&gt; &gt; descendants are still raising cattle here.  While pacing the <br/>
grounds I <br/>
&gt; &gt; decided to hide something for posterity. When you and the <br/>
children visit us <br/>
&gt; &gt; next try out my clues and see if you can find it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; From Hopmeadow Street on the east stands a sycamore tree of large <br/>
dimension <br/>
&gt; &gt; the furthest south near the pass way labeled Phelps Lane.  From <br/>
the east <br/>
&gt; &gt; side of the trunk go 50 paces to the green tavern door where my <br/>
&gt; &gt; great-grandfather used to sit on the porch and wait for travelers <br/>
to arrive <br/>
&gt; &gt; by foot or stagecoach. From this southernmost door of our home, <br/>
you must <br/>
&gt; &gt; cross southeast to the corner of the calving barn.  (I hope it <br/>
does not <br/>
&gt; &gt; catch fire as some barns have lately and leave just the walls <br/>
standing.) <br/>
&gt; &gt; From the northwest corner of the back stone wall of the barn go <br/>
northeast <br/>
&gt; &gt; to stand of birch trees.  Looking to your right you can see the <br/>
new <br/>
&gt; &gt; passenger depot.  Looking to your left you can see a chunk of <br/>
quartz topped <br/>
&gt; &gt; granite on top of the hillside.  It still has Mr. Barber's <br/>
blasting marks <br/>
&gt; &gt; in it.  To the left of the granite you will see the stand of <br/>
trees we <br/>
&gt; &gt; planted when you and I were children to screen the pigsty from <br/>
the train <br/>
&gt; &gt; noise.  Here behind a large rock with cobblestones is your <br/>
treasure.  Leave <br/>
&gt; &gt; me a note to let me know that you found it as I will be away <br/>
traveling for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the next few months.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Your loving cousin,<br/>
&gt; &gt;    Jeffery O. Phelps<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
