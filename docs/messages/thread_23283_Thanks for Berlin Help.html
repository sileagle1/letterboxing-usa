                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I did manage to find *one* rock in all the parkland of Berlin and <br/>
was able to plant a box I'd prepared while still in the states. I'll <br/>
do micros next time, most definitely!<br/>
<br/>
I had thought about ditching the box I'd brought with me and going <br/>
with something more easily hidden in an urban setting, but I had <br/>
sticker shock after pricing little lock tites in the shopping center --<br/>
 five euros for one container! No wonder letterboxing isn't widespread <br/>
here! ;O)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, "In Celebration" was successfully planted in the Rudow section <br/>
of Berlin. If you plan to be in Berlin, I hope you'll look for it and <br/>
drop me a line to let me know what shape it's in. I should be back at <br/>
the end of summer and can maintain it then.<br/>
