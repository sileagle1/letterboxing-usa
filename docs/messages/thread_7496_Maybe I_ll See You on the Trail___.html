                    <div class="plaintext-content">I will be journeying to New Jersey to visit a friend next week, and <br/>
will be introducing her to letterboxing while I am there.  We have <br/>
selected a few boxes in the area to hunt down and have a couple of <br/>
plants planned -- the stamps are carved and boxes in my suitcase.  I <br/>
am also planning to do some hunting along the way -- Eastern MI, OH, <br/>
PA...  hopefully bring my F number up to be more proportionate with <br/>
my P number.  Ahhhh... so many letterboxes, so little time <sigh><br/>
<br/>
It would really be cool to get something to put behind that X!  Who <br/>
knows...  maybe I'll see you on the trail!<br/>
