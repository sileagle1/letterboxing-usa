Though I risk asking a question that may have been answered many <br/>
times before (alas, a search on "boxes" turns up far too many hits on <br/>
this list), may I respectfully inquire where you purchase the nifty <br/>
little boxes around which you build your fake rocks?  Moody Cat is <br/>
closely guarding the one she won at the SLO gathering, and my begging <br/>
and wheedling have heretofore failed to move her. A search of our <br/>
local Wal-Mart, Target, Michael's, and even Big Lots have failed to <br/>
turn up anything remotely similar in size. Alas!  Alack!  My dream of <br/>
starting a fake rock-making facility here in the southland seems <br/>
destined to died a-borning! <heavy sigh=""><br/>

I'm not Sir B., but those are my favorite little square boxes too.  <br/>
Sir B. and I buy TONS of them at the Dollar Only store in Santa <br/>
Maria.  Four for a dollar, and they are the best size and shape I can <br/>
imagine.<br/>
