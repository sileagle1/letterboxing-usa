    Don't fret. We didn't find another Legerdermaine's Hitchhiker . . . <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WE FOUND 5 MORE!!<br/>
<br/>
    Left one for those following us and took the other 4 with us to hide<br/>
in CT somewhere. We will hide the first tomorrow. Sorry you couldn't be<br/>
with us and Bin Laden, Sadam, Pol Pot, Mao and Hitler. We were very<br/>
happy campers!!!! I can't wait to hear from Brian!<br/>
