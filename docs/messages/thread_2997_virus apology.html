I'm sorry if you got a virus through my email.<br/>
I'm all clean now<br/>
Somehow as I have a cable modem I was targeted by this SirCam Worm <br/>
All my EXE files were infected and I had no control over it.<br/>
We had to reformat the hard drive and reinstall the operating system. <br/>
Lost everything.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if your virus checkers did not pick up on it Mine did'nt until <br/>
it was too late.<br/>
<br/>
Don't hate the messenger please.<br/>
This year's motto "Don't open attachment from people you DO know"<br/>
<br/>
Once again I'm sincerely sorry this has happened.<br/>

Thank god I use Unix, which is why I was able to catch this one.  This<br/>
brings up a legitimate point, I am a little concerned that some of the<br/>
clues are written in MS word files.  I usually never open attachments, and<br/>
the one's I do receive by email I first open up in a text editor (Notepad,<br/>
vi, whatever) before I launch them in Office.  In general I would like to<br/>
encourage people to learn HTML, it is actually quite easy considering that<br/>
there are tons of available software which does the code for you<br/>
(Especially if the clues are just graphics and text.)<br/>
<br/>
Remember that not everyone owns MS Office (even though Microsoft would<br/>
want everyone to own two copies.)<br/>
<br/>
Viruses passing through network drives is another issue....<br/>
<br/>
Also, just as an aside, there is free Virus Scanning software available<br/>
which runs directly through a website (housecall.antivirus.com) It will<br/>
clean but not protect, but the nice part is that is always up to date.<br/>
