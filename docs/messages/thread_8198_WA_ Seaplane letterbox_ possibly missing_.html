to go missing in a week--I'm starting to get paranoid about this).  <br/>
It was the most vulnerable of the lot of 28 I'd placed recently, so <br/>
I didn't really expect it to last long (but at least I thought a few <br/>
letterboxers would find it).  I'll check it out and see about <br/>
replacing it ASAP.  This is getting frustrating!  This was probably <br/>
the cutest stamp, too, unfortunately!  :(<br/>
