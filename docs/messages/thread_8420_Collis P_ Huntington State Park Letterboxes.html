<p><span>Planted by Linda &amp; Bob on 10/15/02</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Easy to Moderate walk on wide trails.<span>  </span>4 letterboxes on a 3.1-mile figure 8
loop.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>To find the main entrance to Collis P.
Huntington State Park, turn onto Sunset Hill Rd. in West Redding from Rt.
58.<span>  </span>The park is .7 miles on your
right with an ample parking lot.<span> 
</span>The park closes at sunset.<span> 
</span>Two beautiful statues sculpted by Anna Hyatt Huntington grace the
entrance to this beautiful park.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Pick up a map if you would like at the
information station.<span>  </span>Most of the
trails are marked, but the markings are not very close together.<span>  </span>The trails are obvious for the most part,
so you shouldn’t have any problems.<span> 
</span>All degrees markings are from compass magnetic north.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Follow the well-worn trail past the
information station down the hill through the field.<span>  </span>At the bottom of the hill, turn left onto an unmarked wide
trail.<span>  </span>You will soon be on the
blue trail heading north.<span>  </span>Fields
will be on your left.<span>  </span>Soon after
going through an old metal fence, turn right, heading east, onto the white
trail.<span>  </span>You will pass a lake on you
left.<span>  </span>After you pass the lake for
the second time, you will come to a T intersection.<span>  </span>Go 120 degrees on the orange trail.<span>  </span>From the first boulder you come to on
the right (about 3 feet high) the 1<sup>st</sup> letterbox position is in
sight.<span>  </span>Facing away from the
boulder, bushwack 25 paces at 70 degrees up a small hill.<span>  </span>At the V tree, go 5 steps to a triple
maple tree.<span>  </span>The first letterbox is
hidden under the East end under the small rock outcropping.<span>  </span>Stamp and carefully re-hide.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Backtrack to the T intersection.<span>  </span>Now head 30 degrees on the orange
trail.<span>  </span>A lake will be on your
left.<span>  </span>At the bottom of the hill,
you will see another pond.<span>  </span>Turn
right onto the orange trail walking on the south side of the pond.<span>  </span>At the end of the pond you will see a
fork, turn 36 degrees and walk across a small wooden bridge.<span>  </span>You are now on the green trail.<span>  </span>About 20 feet before the rusted gate,
go north on the white trail.<span>  </span>This
trail is not very well marked, so more detailed directions will follow.<span>  </span>Directly before the brook, go uphill
over a rock outcropping.<span>  </span>The brook
is on your right.<span>  </span>Now cross the
brook by the dam heading NW up the hill.<span> 
</span>The white trail will soon take you to another small parking lot.<span>  </span>Walk along the right edge of the
parking lot for a short distance.<span> 
</span>It is now time to head NE on the blue trail.<span>  </span>After you pass the fiber-optic line (like a gas pipeline),
you will soon approach a very large rock outcropping on your left,
approximately 35 feet tall.<span>  </span>While
facing the rock, notice the location of the black birch tree, on the right,
touching the rock.<span>  </span>Bushwack around
the NW side of the rock to the top.<span> 
</span>Head to the SE corner of the rock by the noted black birch tree.<span>  </span>Where the rocks have a one-foot gap,
look underneath the overhanging rock to find the Bear Letterbox, letterbox
#2.<span>  </span>Stamp and carefully re-hide.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Continue east on the blue trail.<span>  </span>Other trails will intersect, but just
stay on the blue.<span>  </span>Eventually, you
will come to an intersection where the blue trail goes right and left, and the
white trail heads straight ahead.<span> 
</span>You will know you are in the correct location if you see a 10 foot by 20
foot pit in front of you.<span>  </span>It is
here that you will wander off the blue trail to find the Mica Mine and the Wolf
Letterbox.<span>  </span>At the pit, head SE on
the white trail, passing the DD mark on your left.<span>  </span>The uphill trail will be filled with mica as you approach
the mica mine.<span>  </span>At the top of the
hill (you will see several mica pits), go briefly NE and then E following an
unmarked trail up a hill to a large 3 ridged large rock overlooking a mica
quarry.<span>  </span>The unmarked trail now
heads NNE on the NW ridge of the quarry through a mountain laurel grove.<span>  </span>At the NE end of the quarry, cross over
a natural rock bridge.<span>  </span>Look for a
sizable quadruple trunked tree.<span> 
</span>Proceed 15 steps along the ridge in a southern direction.<span>  </span>Find a 3-foot tall quartz and mica rock
with a blasting hole in the northern corner.<span>  </span>The Wolf letterbox is under the southern corner of this
rock.<span>  </span>Stamp and carefully
replace.<span>  </span>Retrace your steps
through the Mica Mine section back to the pit/blue trail intersection.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Once you reach the pit, turn left onto the
blue trail.<span>  </span>At the fiber optics EE
pole, continue E on the blue trail scrambling up and down several times on this
wide trail.<span>  </span>This is the hardest
part of the trail, but it isn’t too bad.<span> 
</span>After passing pole 277, but before the next pole, turn right in a SW
direction at the bottom of the hill onto the green trail;<span>  </span>pass over a wooden bridge.<span>  </span>Take a right at the tree with an E
placard onto the orange trail.<span>  </span>At
the Y intersection, continue on the orange trail, which brings you on the east
side of the 2<sup>nd</sup> lake.<span> 
</span>At the next Y intersection, go SE on the orange trail which will take
you past the first letterbox.<span>  </span>At
the bottom of the hill, turn south onto the blue trial.<span>  </span>You will go over yet another wooden
bridge.<span>  </span>While strolling along a
welcome flat section of the blue trail, you will not miss the 6 trunk silver
beech tree on the left side of the trail.<span> 
</span>From this magnificent tree, go due east 20 paces to a 5-foot rock off
the trail.<span>  </span>The Horse Letterbox is
planted sideways on the north side of this rock between the main rock and a
smaller connecting rock.<span>  </span>Stamp and
re-hide.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span> </span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Continue east on the blue marked
trail.<span>  </span>The trail narrows and
appears to disappear, but the blue marks are not far to find.<span>  </span>When in doubt, take a few lefts.<span>  </span>That will be the way to go.<span>  </span>Soon you will see a major unmarked
trail, which if you take to the left and go south towards the field, will bring
you right back at your car.<span>  </span>We
hope you had an enjoyable experience.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
