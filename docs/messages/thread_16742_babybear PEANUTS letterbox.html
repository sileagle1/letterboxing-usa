                    <div class="plaintext-content">found this in mcallister park today and it is in good shape and i hid it well back in its spot...<br/>
<br/>
but on the directions to get to it it says ""go to the bathrooms and then go right"" and in parenthesis it says "south" when our compass read turning right at the bathrooms takes you north...<br/>
<br/>
we went south (not turning right) and had a long walk did not find anything listed in the clues but saw lots of deer running in the woods...at first i thought they were dogs but closer look were deer....so turned back and this time turned right at the bathrooms (north) and found it right away....two people were reading the compass...and both read it as north.....so remember when coming from the parking lot and facing the bathrooms to go right....<br/>
<br/>
had a good time finding this one...thanks for hiding it babybear...<br/>
