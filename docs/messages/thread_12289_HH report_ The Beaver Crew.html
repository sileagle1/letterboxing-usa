Uconn / Avery Point.   It was left there by someone who forgot to <br/>
add their personal stamp in it ( I think the name was Melissa? ) on <br/>
4/15/03 and they were awaiting the arrival of the USS Toledo into <br/>
Groton Sub-Base after the conflict in Iraq. Prior to that I see <br/>
Canopy Rock on 3/20/03 and Meshamosic SF on 3/11/03. Other visits <br/>
include the winter gathering, Butterfly and BlueBird (several <br/>
times), Pete and wanda and many many other personal stamps. We <br/>
visited NL Ledge Light and will probably put this guy back out in <br/>
the next week or so!<br/>
