                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I started it, now I am offering an olive branch to put it to <br/>
rest (Re: Help me out with this). I meant absolutely no harm in e-<br/>
mailing the Fox 6 meteorologist to just tell him about the 4H <br/>
project. That was my whole intent.  He was very interested in that <br/>
the 4H angle and asked if he could come over, interview the kids <br/>
about how 4H does a similar thing to geocaching, but a whole lot <br/>
cheaper.  I'm here to tell ya, he spent a lot of time talking about <br/>
4H and that the fact that it still exists. He was astounded at our <br/>
really big project--and it isn't letterboxing. It's dairy cattle.  <br/>
That was strange to him, because I work for a suburban club and we <br/>
can't keep cattle in our back yards.  It's sort of a rent-a-cow deal <br/>
whereby the kids go to a farm, work with the animals and take them to <br/>
the fair. Last year, a total of THIRTY-ONE cows were taken. Can you <br/>
imagine the work for that leader? I only have to worry about camo <br/>
tape and a little box! The truth of the matter is that no matter how <br/>
much we promote projects, families are busy and I only have three <br/>
kids signed up for Letterboxing.  On the little feature, family <br/>
members including dads showed up so we looked like a meeting is <br/>
supposed to. I had hoped to tape the feature and use it at our next <br/>
project push (Fall) to get kids interested. Last year, I had <br/>
stamping 'stuff', boxes, etc., and some of our pictures to show, but <br/>
I didn't get much interest, hence the 3 kids only.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, when the piece was aired, it was edited up the wazoo and <br/>
4H was barely mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
I was so surprised with the unhappiness I caused in the other site <br/>
that I erased myself from the group. So when I got to fretting over <br/>
it, I couldn't go back in and respond to the post. This is the only <br/>
site I had left in my groups, so I came in here to vent, not to cause <br/>
big trouble and hard feelings. I rarely go into either site, (just to <br/>
see if there is a gathering now and then), so I hadn't read anything <br/>
about non-publicity issues. I had read all the directions, picked up <br/>
from a gathering that kids showed up and had a good time, made sure <br/>
my kids knew how to be discreet when searching and putting back in <br/>
good order, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I always think I have to teach everyone about things that I like to <br/>
do. It just isn't the same to me if I'm enjoying wonderful <br/>
experiences and not sharing them.  I went on a hiking vacation last <br/>
October, for example. I became totally hooked, bought all kinds of <br/>
hiking things one probably doesn't need, I try talking colleagues <br/>
into doing laps at work, drag my husband out at the crack of dawn for <br/>
a quidk 5 miles--well, you get the picture. He also letterboxes with <br/>
me because he is a patient person and I need a body guard when the <br/>
spots are remote.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of my friends think I'm nuts and won't walk a foot, let alone a <br/>
mile to either hike or find a box. So everyone's boxes are safe from <br/>
them, let me assure you! And the kids, too. They are so busy with <br/>
other things, that we go out twice a school year--that's it. <br/>
<br/>
As for my 15 minutes of fame, the mini-feature wasn't shocking, it <br/>
wasn't breaking news, it wasn't what people are watching these days. <br/>
Too many prefer the sad auditions on American Idol. And of course, <br/>
that was the day that Anna Nicole Smith died. My story ended in a <br/>
flash. That one will go on and on and on. Our poor children see that <br/>
stuff on TV constantly, unless families get away from the tube. (And <br/>
hike. And letterbox).<br/>
<br/>
So again, PEACE. There is too much angst in the world and my <br/>
intention wasn't to create more.<br/>

even though the reporter did not mention being careful when looking<br/>
for boxes or 4-H. You had good intentions and you made sure to take<br/>
the reporter to your own box. I understand what you mean about being<br/>
an educator and wanting to share things you have discovered with other<br/>
people. I am the same way. Sorry people were hurtful about it.<br/>
