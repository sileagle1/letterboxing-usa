<br/><b><u>Search for the Golden Acorn: Ranger Tom’s Excellent Adventure (3)</u></b>
<br/>A Trio of boxes in Greenbrier State Park
<br/>Near Hagerstown, MD in Washington County
<br/>8 October 2002
<br/>Placed by the Apple Dumpling Gang (<a href="mailto:adglbna@aol.com">adglbna@aol.com</a>)<br/> <br/>Take Route 40 towards Hagerstown and the park will be onyour left.  You will need to pay a smalladmission to get in.  ( it varies from$2.00 per vehicle off season to $3.00 per person during the summer)  Take a left at the T intersection at thebottom of the hill and park near the Visitor’s Center.  If it is open, pop in and pick up a trailmap.  There are over 10 miles of trailsin this park but unfortunately there are no pets allowed.  The trails are well marked but the footingis uneven and rocky so wear good shoes.<br/> <br/><b><u>The Thorn in his Side- Box 1</u>
<br/></b><p align="CENTER">
<br/></p><p align="LEFT">Ranger Tom Cooch knew he would be in real trouble if theother rangers ever found out what he was doing.  He was supposed to be out on the trail pulling the pesky boxes out of their leafy niches but instead, here he was, book in hand, desperately trying to find the Golden Acorn so he could be the first to stamp in.  He half wished that he had never met Kel, Marsha, and the Lighthouse Lady on the trail and been lured into this twisted double life.  <br/> <br/>Tom started his journey on the green blazed trail behind the Visitor’s Center.  He knew these trails pretty well so he decided to start at the end of the loop since it might be shorter.  He walked up the trail between the two piles of wood and started up the hill, reminiscing about the beautiful Dazyes that used to blanket these woods. He and his girlfriend Mary (from VA) used to come out here when it was dark and watch the Fireflys dance among the flowers.  He carefully walked around the fallen trees and continued up the hill passing the Deer Tracks sign. (#11) After Tom passed sign number 8 (black bear) he noticed a small patch of white to his left.  Here, where two trees on one trunk oozed over the white rocks, someone had stashed a box!  Tom was one excited Newbe!  <br/> <br/><b><u>The Haunted House (aka The Leapfrog Incident)- Box 2</u></b><br/><br/>Tom continued up the trail (still going the wrong way, which is actually the right way, can you tell Tom was raised by a Psychomommy?)  past sign #7  and parked it on a bench. Some hippies had obviously hiked this way and had taken a moment to carve “Healwar” and “Scott hugs trees” into the bench.  One of the other rangers had reported some paranormal activity on the yellow blazed trail up ahead so he decided to check it out.  Supposedly, Biki, a young Irish immigrant, had died out here while playing a rousing game of Leapfrog.  Ashamed by his tragic (and quite ludicrous) death, Biki’s ghost had been seen jumping about the trails desperately trying to regain his Celtic Pride.  <br/> <br/>Tom slowly made his way up the boulder strewn gully following the yellow blazes.  Where the yellow blazed trail takes a hard left, Tom noticed a new sign which reads,  “Trail Closed for Habitat Regeneration.” On the sign was a cute little Ladybug napping between the H and the A.. As he gazed to the left, Tom was astounded to see thousands more ladybugs at the base of the large hipped, gnarled tree. Could these be related to Biki and the haunting?  He just had to know!  Upon investigating this bizarre infestation,Tom found yet another box under some leaves, sticks, and about 2384 ladybugs.(yes, he stopped to count.)<br/> <br/><b><u>The Golden Acorn (aka Tribute to Squirrel)- Box 3</u>
<br/></b></p><p align="CENTER">
<br/></p><p align="LEFT">Tom couldn’t believe his luck!  2 boxes found and he hadn’t even snared the one he came for…the elusive Golden Acorn.  He headed back down the yellow blazed trail until he reached the “hippy” bench.  Seated on the bench were a Turtle and a Mountain Scorpia playing canasta. Carefully avoiding the bench, Tom headed down the green blazed trail to the left.  The tribute box was supposed to be down here somewhere near some piles of rocks that ran along the left side of the trail. (if you reach sign #4, you’ve gone too far) He found the area described and pinpointed the location of the white rock in the middle of the grouping.  From that rock, Tom took a bearing of 25°and spotted the large fallen and decaying tree.  At the end of the tree, just behind the stump, Tom finally found the Golden Acorn under some bark.  With triumphant glee, he yawped his battle cry into the woods…..Boxitup!<br/> <br/>(note to Tom: The Maryland Chapter of Boxaholics Anonymous meets at the 3rd tree stump on the left on alternate Tuesdays and Thursdays at moonset. Rangers are welcome.)<br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/></p></body></html>

please let us know! <br/>
<br/>
We have been on a bit of a roll recently for several reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Sarah is a carving maniac and is always about 5-8 stamps ahead<br/>
2.  We received intense pressure and death threats from Psychomommy   <br/>
and Firefly if we didn't place boxes in MD immediately<br/>
3.  We are total junkies and need psychiatric help!<br/>
<br/>
As for the mutual admiration, please do not fret.  All boxers are <br/>
official members of the ADG's admiration society but the East Coast <br/>
Meet and Greeters were specially mentioned here for a specific <br/>
reason.  To find out why, please visit the boxes.<br/>
