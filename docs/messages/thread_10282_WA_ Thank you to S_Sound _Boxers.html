I have a theme , all I need to do is link it into the park.<br/>
<br/>
I assume, like all good scouts they will have a compass available.<br/>

between Alder, Fir and Cedar.  They are pretty good at counting <br/>
boardwalks, bridges, and benches too.<br/>
<br/>
I will be teaching the other 2 boys how to do these things that day<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
