Start at the center of the main parking lot of the W.S. Carpenter Jr. Recreation Area of the White Clay Creek Preserve on Route 896 North going out of Newark.<br/>
<br/>
Go North northwest until the end of the mowed area.<br/>
<br/>
Turn right and follow the edge of the field.<br/>
<br/>
Continue straight down the path.  You are now going East Southeast.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the path.  It curves to the left.<br/>
<br/>
Continue until you see a path branching off from the left.<br/>
<br/>
Turn left down this path.  You are now going North.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the path down into the ravine.<br/>
<br/>
Go across the right angle bridge, not the straight one.<br/>
<br/>
Do not cross the second bridge on your left.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the path to the right and up hill.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the zigzagy path past the "Hip Cirlce/Lift Off" stand on your right.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the path up a small hill.<br/>
<br/>
See station # 9 on your left.<br/>

We had our 8 year old and 2 year old with us.  It was a great hunt <br/>
for kids.  Our 8 year old was actually the one to find the box and <br/>
was thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great Delaware letterbox hunt!<br/>

&gt; From Station # 9 sign, go 20-22 regular steps down the path.  You <br/>
will be at the bend of a slight left hand curve.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Turn left.  You will be facing North.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See two trees the bases of which come together at the ground.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Go through the "V"  the two trunks make and dig at the base of the <br/>
trees.<br/>

&gt; Wolfbox is waiting for you with a small gift!<br/>
