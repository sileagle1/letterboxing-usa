&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello Everyone-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It has been a long time since I have done anything related to<br/>
&gt;letterboxing.  Dartmoor seems so long ago!  Since then I might have<br/>
&gt;found 10 letterboxes.  I have been stuck a little below 500F since<br/>
&gt;January!  It has been a very slow spring in terms of letterboxes.  I<br/>
&gt;was hoping to get back into the swing of things this Saturday.  I am<br/>
&gt;planning on starting in the early morning this Saturday to find some<br/>
&gt;boxes and enjoy the beautiful spring foliage.  I havn't planned where I<br/>
&gt;will start, but I was thinking the eastern side of CT is looking pretty<br/>
&gt;tempting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If anyone of my CT buddies would like to join me, please drop me a<br/>
&gt;line.  I would love to catch up with a few of my long lost friends over<br/>
&gt;an afternoon of hiking and searching for letterboxes!  I hope everyone<br/>
&gt;is safe and enjoying life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Safe Letterboxing- Letterboxer2002 (Alan)<br/>
