I've also been trying to contact Martian Maggot since April.  I, regrettably <br/>
now, took home her stamp and half burned log book, hoping to quickly mail it <br/>
to her because of the apparent vandalism and wanted to suggest a better hiding <br/>
spot.  I'm willing to replant it in the old spot with a new book and container <br/>
but won't be down that way until August. If anyone is interested, it's the <br/>
Spy House letterbox in N.J. I didn't want to leave the stamp there laying in the <br/>
grass with no container and burned log book. I didn't know how or if I could <br/>
officially post that letterbox as out of commission since it wasn't mine. Hope <br/>
no one was looking for it.<br/>
