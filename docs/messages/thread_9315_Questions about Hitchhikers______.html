<div>Good evening fellow boxers ~</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know we've discussed this in the past but for the life of me, I can't get 
my little 'ole hands on the posts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While checking on one of our planted boxes this weekend, we found a 
hitchhiker in there!  You should have seen Buzz &amp; Woody ~ they went 
nuts!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My question is, do I count this as a found hitchhiker?  We stamped it 
into our log book but left it there for someone else to pick up as we weren't 
sure if we should take it or not??  We would like to take it with us on our 
westward bound Thanksgiving jaunt and drop it off at another box but just wanted 
to make sure we were following proper "Hitchhiker Etiquette".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyone care to share their words of wisdom?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Warmest regards,</div>

Hey, Ellen--<br/>
<br/>
I think it's fine if you take the hitchhiker -- you did *find* it, after <br/>
all.  Checking on boxes that you've placed is part of the letterboxing <br/>
experience, so it seems well within letterboxing etiquette to record and <br/>
transport a hitchhiker that you found while doing maintenance on a box you <br/>
placed.<br/>
<br/>

Regarding finding a hitchhiker letterbox while conducting <br/>
maintenance on your own 'placed' letterbox, I agree wholeheartedly <br/>
that you can claim it as a 'found' letterbox.  Coming across a <br/>
hitchhiker letterbox in this scenario serves as a little 'bonus' (or <br/>
chef's treat for you gourmets out there) for all of your hard work &amp; <br/>
investment in creating &amp; placing your letterbox in the area (after <br/>
all placing a letterbox takes a LOT of work).  Some folks who place <br/>
boxes in lightly 'letterboxed' locations need something to look <br/>
forward to especially if the letterboxing phenomenon is taking a <br/>
while to catch on in the area.  Sometimes the 'place them and they <br/>
will come' mantra takes a LONG time for it to take effect, so <br/>
looking forward to a hitchhiker or two in your own placed box is a <br/>
very welcome surprise &amp; inspirational, too!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun in your letterboxing travels &amp; adventures!<br/>
