<div>Hello to all from Fredericksburg, VA. I am new at 
this game and would like to place some 
letterboxes in my area. I have checked out a nice nature / fitness trail that is 
about 1 - 1.5 miles long oneway. Would 2 or 3 boxes be to many for the one 
trail? Are most limited to 1 box for any given area..</div>
<div>Thanks   I am lookiing forward to getting 
the family out looking as soon as I get my personal stamp made..</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I like the idea of a mixed set of instruction. I am 
a bit of a geek and love to use my GPS anytime I can. That is also why I 
recently place a Geocache / GPS stash in my area too. <a href="http://www.1bigred.com/jayc/geocache/breckcache.htm">http://www.1bigred.com/jayc/geocache/breckcache.htm</a></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Jay, no: you can put out as many boxes on the trail as you think fit <br/>
the "flow" of the hike. We really like series of linked boxes because <br/>
we sort of get in a rhythm: finding one is fun, but looking for <br/>
several is great too. When we do multiples like that, we try to box <br/>
the highlights of the trail (overlooks, waterfalls, points of <br/>
interest), or do the beginning-middle-end of the hike. Go for it!<br/>
