                    <div class="plaintext-content">Piers Gorge is located on the Menominee River just south of Norway,<br/>
Michigan.  From Norway take Hwy. 8 south for 1.2 miles until you see the<br/>
sign on the right. Take the road indicated to the end. It end in the parking<br/>
lot. Follow the trail to the 2nd. Pier. BE CAREFUL!, there are a lot of<br/>
roots and slippery rocks along this path.<br/>
At the 2nd. Pier take the trail to the left. There will be alarge Cedar tree<br/>
directly in front of you but growing on a lower level. Carefully climb down<br/>
to this level and go to the tree and put your back to the tree. Take a<br/>
compass heading of 310 degrees and go 9 steps in that direction. Turn right<br/>
to face the rocks and look carefully. You should find the box in front of<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck !<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty--Easy<br/>
Terrain--Rocky and Hills - Intermediate<br/>
<br/>
This is a beautiful site. If you have the time go all the way to the 4th.<br/>
Pier.  Enjoy!    The Yoopers<br/>
