  First off, I know all of us as moderators appreciate Jays kudos and <br/>
support. He's the reason that Heidi and I are actuing in that capacity <br/>
and his unwavering fairness as a moderator was impressive when he had <br/>
the time to be more active on this list. <br/>
<br/>
That being said, I think the whole debate about list fracturing has <br/>
become too much of a debate. Don't look at the idea as "don't talk <br/>
about that here". Perhaps that the way to view this is that there's <br/>
soooo many messages posted daily on this big list, that it would be a <br/>
shame to have your message or HH report or Sitrep lost in the clutter. <br/>
Make sense?  <br/>
<br/>
I know as moderators, we [heidi and i]  frequently miss good posts <br/>
because we are set into a "seek and destroy" mode on the bad posts. <br/>
Unfortunately the flames have turned a lot of active boxers away and <br/>
they elect the "no mail" status. They frequently DO monitor the other <br/>
lists such as travellers, newbies, and regional lists because the pace <br/>
is slower and the material more relevent to what they are interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully that might put a fresh spin on the direction this is going. <br/>
Unfortunately as this list expands [rapidly], something is going to <br/>
have to give of we'll all be sorting through 1000 messages a day. As <br/>
much as we don't necessarily LIKE having to watch 3 or 4 lists to get <br/>
all the info we want, its kind of a logical progression.<br/>
<br/>

-- PS -- Now, if someone could figure out a way to allow graphical <br/>
coding and sorting of the big list, that would be way cool! (I.E. a <br/>
little icon for HH, one for flames, one for postals...) <br/>
