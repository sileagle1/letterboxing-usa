Easy urban park walking<br/>
.<br/>
"'Zoo Two" is hidden in Milham Park, in the southeast corner of <br/>
Kalamazoo, Michigan. (The park is adjacent to Milham Golf Course).<br/>
The main entrance to the park is located at the corner of Kilgore <br/>
Road and Lovers Lane. (Easily accessible from I-94: use the Portage <br/>
Rd exit then Kilgore west to Lovers Lane and the park).  Check a city <br/>
map for details. Mapquest or links from City of Kalamazoo website  <br/>
Parks Division  should help.<br/>
Note: This is a popular and well-used park. Be discreet when <br/>
searching/discovering the box to avoid revealing its location.<br/>
Further caveat: if the ground is snow covered you may experience <br/>
difficulty with this box.<br/>
<br/>
Park in the main lot at the Kilgore/Lovers Lane corner.<br/>
Now the fun startsand always remember to look high and low as you go!<br/>
Standing in the stone shelter let the red arrow point the way.<br/>
Follow the paved walkway heading north.  At the cross go right for <br/>
100 paces. Cross &amp; cross then step up 15 and on to 139 below.  Sight <br/>
340 degrees to the talkingtree.  Follow the line two more. Though it <br/>
splits, it makes no trouble.  Now look 20 degrees and go on to find a <br/>
lonely blockhead with hair.<br/>
