                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, my family is very new at this but this seems to be working for <br/>
us. It is very difficult to go out and be discreet in a group of 4 <br/>
to 7 people, especially with kids along. So, we don't even try. The <br/>
kids are allowed to get a bit unruly. I make sure I yell at them a <br/>
couple of times to "Get out of that bush!" or "Get down out of that <br/>
tree!" Then a grownup ends up dragging the littlest one out of a <br/>
hiding place. Oh, and while he's in there, he grabs the letterbox, <br/>
too. We stamp over lunch, then make a big todo of taking a group <br/>
picture in front of this "lovely five-trunked tree" that is just <br/>
perfect for a family photo. We look like a bunch of tourists with <br/>
obnoxious kids. It seems to work. People would rather get away from <br/>
us than care what we are actually doing. And we get a wonderful <br/>
family picnic out of the whole thing. It's kind of like <br/>
a "diversionary" stealth. Watch the pretty waving handkerchief while <br/>
I set up my next trick, lol. <br/>

I carry my LB supplies in a plastic clipboard box that opens up, so when I am sitting, stamping it, it looks like I am drawing or taking notes.<br/>
<br/>
As for pulling a box out of its hidey hole I usually will either wait until no one is around or, if that is not an option, I will comment purposely about what a cool bug that is or about some feature of the tree etc. Carrying a field guide wouldn't hurt.<br/>

I believe it was Warrior Woman who commented that her favorite routine with her kids was to say, "You have to go again?!...okay go behind that tree". (LOL)With a wink to the kids, off they'd go.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm fairly new at this, but here are the things we've done so far:<br/>
<br/>
- a somewhat urban letterbox: we went at 2am since this is a popular tourist<br/>
site and we didn't think we'd be able to get it w/o being seen. This was our<br/>
first find, so we didn't know any of the tricks yet.<br/>
<br/>
- we had to skip our second find and go back for the next day because there <br/>
was someone sitting right near it<br/>
<br/>
- at one hidden in a cemetary full of tourists, we pretended to be setting our <br/>
stuff down so we could take a picture, then when we picked our stuff back up <br/>
we also grabbed the box with it<br/>
<br/>
- at one hidden near a popular waterfront walk, we set down all our stuff near <br/>
the box, then decided to move to somewhere else to watch the seaotters, grabbed <br/>
the box while collecting all our stuff to move. When rehidding it, we pretended <br/>
to be searching for something in our backpack, took everything out in a big <br/>
pile right next to the hidding place, then rehid it while putting stuff back <br/>
in the backpack.<br/>
<br/>
The basic idea we use is, if possible, do it while no one is around. If that's<br/>
not possible, make it look like we're doing something normal, so people don't<br/>
wonder what we're doing. If that's not possible, skip the box til a better time.<br/>
Be especially careful when there are kids around, they are very observant!<br/>
<br/>
As for descretion while stamping, we generally take the box away from the <br/>
hidding place, then sit down as if to rest/draw/read/whatever. We have not<br/>
figured out how people "stamp in quickly", since we like to look through the<br/>
logbook, write a comment, etc. So insead, we take our time, but not too near <br/>
the hidding place if there are people around. We like hiking too, so a lot of<br/>
the boxes we've found don't have many people around anyway.<br/>

distraction!  They will always be picking up leaves, rocks, etc.  <br/>
Use that to your advantage.  I've always found though that if we <br/>
don't make a big deal out of our being there, that most people just <br/>
walk past us without worrying what we're doing.  We grab our box as <br/>
quickly &amp; discreetly as we can (obviously we don't do it if a person <br/>
is right there) &amp; then if we have to move away to stamp in, we <br/>
settle down somewhere in a circle &amp; just look like we're doing some <br/>
sort of activity- which we are.  Most people could care less.  We're <br/>
pretty quick when we need be with one of us poised with the stamp, <br/>
one with the ink pad, one with the book (&amp; the two-year old chasing <br/>
a bug).  Putting it back seems to be trickier as you want it to be <br/>
well-hidden.  The two-year old is great for this because we use him <br/>
as a great excuse to play in the rocks &amp; sticks.  Then, my 6-year <br/>
old is the judge of whether or not it is hidden well-enough.  She <br/>
stands back &amp; at many different angles &amp; looks to see if any part of <br/>
the box is showing &amp; if it is, she directs the 2-year old to gather <br/>
more rocks.  :)<br/>

trail <br/>

We once spotted a couple looking very suspicious: dressed in hiking <br/>
boots, shorts, and outdoorsy-looking hats, they were peering into a <br/>
crevice, digging in a backpack, looking at a book.... I guessed they <br/>
were letterboxers, but my husband insisted they were wildlife <br/>
biologists. Says he's seen the type a million times. I still said <br/>
letterboxers. So, to settle the argument, he marches over and <br/>
asks, "Are you wildlife biologists?" To which she says, "No, we just <br/>
like to wear funny hats." Turns out they had a new digital camera <br/>
they were using to photograph a really big bug in the crevice, and <br/>
were taking the manual out of the bag for instructions.<br/>
So, yes, the two activities DO look alike. Just remember your funny <br/>
hat.<br/>

I generally find that if I move far enough away and act like I'm not <br/>
doing anything sneaky, no one even looks twice.<br/>
<br/>
For Father's Day, my sister and I gave our dad his own letterboxing <br/>
stuff and took him to a popular park in Rhode Island to find his <br/>
first few.  The third one in the series was RIGHT next to several <br/>
rock climbers.  It was so close that when my dad stood on the low <br/>
wall where the box was, one of the rock climbers ran into him!  So, <br/>
we all stood there, watching these spider people, wondering what in <br/>
the world to do...we coudn't go home without this stamp, after all.  <br/>
So, Dad (remember, this is his first time out) cooly bends over, <br/>
grabs the box, and takes off.  My sister and I didn't even see him <br/>
take it!  We ran to catch up to him, yelling after him to ask why he <br/>
was taking off like that.  Imagine our surprise when he turns around <br/>
and hisses through clenched teeth that WE were blowing HIS cover!<br/>

If you take a plastic bag with you and pick up some trash (or at least look for some while you are searching).<br/>
<br/>
I also have a safety vest (those bright orange or yellow vests that construction workers wear) that I wear when I am looking for survey benchmarks and sometimes when I am looking for letterboxes in busy areas.<br/>
<br/>
You can spend a lot of time in an area looking for things, under things, walking back and forth, etc. before someone will question what you are doing.  It also helps to carry a clipboard.  For some reason, clipboards just carry an air of officiality.<br/>

  Subject: [LbNA] Any ideas on how to be discreet??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I am looking for suggestions about how to be discreet when trying to <br/>
  retrieve a letterbox without being seen.  In this day and age, <br/>
  people are bound to wonder what the heck I am doing poking around.  <br/>
  And I don't want to be detected.  But what do other boxers do?  <br/>
  Pretend to be painting, looking at plants or for bugs???  Thanks.<br/>
