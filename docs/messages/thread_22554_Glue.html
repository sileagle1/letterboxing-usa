<br/>
But, as a full time artist, I can't stress enough how important it is<br/>
to inform ourselves about the health risks of any art material we use,<br/>
particularly in our homes.  We do tend to make art on our kitchen<br/>
tables, and you've got to take that fact seriously.  <br/>
<br/>
Since there is a sort of innocent-until-proven-guilty approach to<br/>
health labelling in the United States, you have to be extra careful. <br/>
Art hazard labeling assume that the material in question is being used<br/>
in a dedicated studios space (not the kitchen) and only by healthy<br/>
adult workers (not by or near your kids and pets).<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago, it came out that Fimo and Sculpey put off some<br/>
serious vapors when baked, and of course, most everyone using these<br/>
products had been baking them in the kitchen oven, not thinking there<br/>
would be any problem with this...<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to go on at such length on this subject....  If anyone wants<br/>
more info, they can contact me off-list, or visit the following<br/>
website for great technical data sheets.  (For a variety of legal<br/>
reasons, they don't offer these data sheets online, but they are<br/>
really cheap to order.)<br/>
