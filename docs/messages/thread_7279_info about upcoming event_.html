(E. Hartford, CT)<br/>
<br/>
well, well, well...after being a hopeless letterboxing addict for <br/>
about a year now, I've been finally able to join "da group"!  :)  I <br/>
was talking letterboxing to some students, parents, and faculty at my <br/>
school yesterday.  I mentioned that I had heard that there was going <br/>
to be a "kids event" in CT later on this fall. I was wondering if <br/>
there is any other additional information available that I could pass <br/>
on. On the web site there doesn't seem to be anything to "click" on <br/>
regarding this. <br/>
<br/>
It's amazing how after awhile I feel like I know a lot of you based <br/>
on your stamps, comments, clue styles and boxes.  Hope to see you <br/>
face to face one day.  Happy trails one and all.  You are all awesome!<br/>
<br/>
PS...to those who despair about not finding any hitchhikers...be <br/>
patient!!.  I've gone several months without encountering any.  I've <br/>
almost gotten to the point of making a game of seeing just how long I <br/>
can go without any hitchhikers finding ME!!! \<br/>

Josef (a.k.a.  Joe/Jose)                            The game is afoot!<br/>
