internet access is intermittent at best. My guess is that any boxes in <br/>
City Park did not survive; that area was under about seven feet of <br/>
water. Audubon Zoo area might be questionable too.<br/>
<br/>
Check carefully the areas that you plan on going to. Much of New <br/>
Orleans is still without power, I understand. The French Quarter is OK <br/>
but that's about it.<br/>
<br/>
Your best bet is to search on LbNA for listed boxes, write the <br/>
placers, and keep your fingers crossed.<br/>

 Placed by: Wes&amp;Roxi (Contact the Placer)Your status: (none)<br/>

Placed by Wes&amp;Roxi on December 28,2005.<br/>
<br/>
On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina made landfall for the second time in <br/>
the United States striking New Orleans before moving to strike Biloxi and <br/>
coastal Mississippi. In the hours that followed the storm, it appeared that New <br/>
Orleans fared better than Mississippi, but when the city's levee system failed, <br/>
the below sea-level city filled like a bowl completely submerging several square <br/>
miles. Some said it would take six months to drain the city and a year before <br/>
it would be habitable again, but residents are trying to bring it back more <br/>
quickly and are making progress every day.<br/>
<br/>
Being from Louisiana, Wes&amp;Roxi had hoped to get a chance to find letterboxes <br/>
in New Orleans, but most were probably lost in the flooding. So we made a trip <br/>
almost four months to the day after Katrina's landfall and planted the Long <br/>
Live New Orleans letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Starting on St. Charles Ave. in front of Loyola University, find Calhoun St. <br/>
on the east side of Audubon Park.<br/>
<br/>
Travel south on Calhoun St. for three blocks and turn right on Hurst St. (3rd <br/>
right after St. Charles).<br/>
<br/>
Park at the end of Hurst St. and walk towards the left of a line of bushes <br/>
along a sidewalk.<br/>
