                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well as previously  warned we went to check on the rising waters near <br/>
trout fishing in america. It's  coming fast. After deliberating we <br/>
pulled it with a  wet forecast we just hate to have a great Drew <br/>
stamp float away. The lake is within one foot of breaching the road I <br/>
had second thoughts driving through although I know it was designed <br/>
for the  flood control and the Army Corp of Engineers watches it <br/>
well. The path was still dry but the water was higher than I had seen <br/>
it in awhile. The dam height is at 26 1/2 feet I've seen it once go <br/>
over 50 after a hurricane. So much water is incredible. well I didn't <br/>
make it to Watermelon Sugar the light was fading to quick so Trout <br/>
Fishing is closed for a day or two as soon as the water is receding I <br/>
will put the box back in its spot. While here Drews I counted 33 <br/>
stamps not including your family ! It has been a busy spot. I <br/>
replaced and doubled up the Ziplocs as the original was torn. Well <br/>
I'll be watching the weather keep dry I'll post a notice when the box <br/>
goes back out.   Carol- in WATERS RISING! CT. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Carol, I knew you secretly wanted to be in the Coast Guard!!! Thank <br/>
you very much for saving Trout Fishing from a swim. In 10 years we've <br/>
never had a flooded basement: now we're barely keeping pace with the <br/>
new sump pump and wet vac-ing (up every hour last night to keep <br/>
pace). Since we very much enjoy sitting and watching flowing waters, <br/>
I wonder how many other letterboxes out there near a once-gentle <br/>
stream are in danger. Think the National Guard is too busy to check?<br/>
