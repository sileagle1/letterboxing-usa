Monday, and were able to find the following letterboxes in spite of <br/>
the rain:  All of Drew Clan's superb Sunday Drive Series (Wow are <br/>
those nice stamps); The Five boxes in the Oriental Medicine Series <br/>
(plus the bonus box); The Gnomelet Box (stamp is pretty well worn), <br/>
and the Gnomelet Series (The Fairy &amp; Slug and Skeeter boxes are<br/>
soaked and need new log books -- we were able to use the stamps, but<br/>
couldn't log in; Fishing Hill and Bunny Hideout were fine); Zoom Zoom <br/>
(beautiful spot in fall); The African Queen; The Whimsy Walk Series <br/>
(all 3 in great shape -- Watch Rock was fun to search for) + The <br/>
Whimsy Village Cairn; and finally found The Wall in Waterford with <br/>
much help from friends on the interpretation.  On top of that, we met <br/>
two groups of letterboxers on the trail and were able to exchange.  <br/>
It's incredible how many letterboxers are out and about in the rain in<br/>
this part of Connecticut.  Many thanks to all the wonderful carvers <br/>
and placers in Connecticut.<br/>
