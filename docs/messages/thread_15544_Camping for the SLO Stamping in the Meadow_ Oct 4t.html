                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those of you who wish to tent camp at the October 4th, SLO <br/>
Stamping in the Meadow event. Here is some information:<br/>
<br/>
San Luis Obispo Parks - El Chorro (just outside San Luis Obispo) <br/>
would be the best, I think but you might also like some other locales <br/>
like Oceano or Lopez Lake, are at<br/>
http://SLOCountyparks.com I believe their fees are about $19 a night <br/>
and are suitable for 6-8 people, maybe 4 tents. <br/>
<br/>
Sand and Surf at http://www.sandandsurf.com/  is a private one in <br/>
Oceano. They are $27 a night, no more than 4 people, 1 tent and 1 <br/>
car. They have many more facilities like swimming pool and laundry.<br/>
<br/>
Morro Bay State Park at http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?<br/>
page_id=594<br/>
also has campsites for tents. This number and site also includes <br/>
camping at Montana del Oro. These sites are first come, first served. <br/>
Phone 805-772-2560 <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some,<br/>
