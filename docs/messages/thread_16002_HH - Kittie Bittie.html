The Kittie Bittie Hitch Hiker was launched by Pine Tree, Pine Cone, and Pine Needle in honor of their family cat.  It had the opportunity to nuzzle up to many new friends at the Molly &amp; Ginger gathering and then spent sometime visiting and playing with Little Bear and Jes.  We are happy to report that she has moved on, we all enjoyed a "seafood feast", and then left her spleeping cozy and warm after a nice bedtime story.<br/>
<br/>
 Best of Luck to you in your travels, Kittie Bittie!<br/>
