<br/>
Planted 9/20/02<br/>
By: Amanda from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
Lewis and Clark explored the West,<br/>
Their Corps of Discovery was the Best of the Best!<br/>
<br/>
One man, John Colter, did not want to go home,<br/>
He stayed in the west and continued to roam.<br/>
<br/>
In the Summer of 1807, he saw amazing things,<br/>
Herds of Buffalo and geysers and hot springs.<br/>
<br/>
When he tried to tell the folks back East about this place,<br/>
They didn't believe him, they laughed in his face!<br/>
<br/>
So in this valley that they called "Colter's Hell",<br/>
when you are here, you'll take the Lone Star trail.<br/>
<br/>
Once you are in front of the main attraction,<br/>
continuing onward across a footbridge is your next action.<br/>
<br/>
After the second footbridge you'll enter a clearing,<br/>
continue onward and downed trees you'll be nearing!<br/>
<br/>
Past the downed trees, a root crosses the path,<br/>
to your right 3 plus 3 steps, you do the math.<br/>
<br/>
On your right is a large tree down on the ground,<br/>
behind a rock shaped like a triangle a letterbox is found!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please read the waiver of responsibility and liability and be <br/>
DISCREET whenever you are hunting or hiding letterboxes!! Maybe you <br/>
should look up the word DISCREET before you go!<br/>
<br/>
