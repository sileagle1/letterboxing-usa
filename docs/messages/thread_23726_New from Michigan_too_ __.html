                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everybody.i joined a few weeks back,but never got around to saying hello.My name is Renee,I'm amrried with 3 daughters who are all thrilled about the idea of letterboxing.A few weeks ago we went to Brandywine Falls in northern Ohio &amp; I saw a a lady with some papers in her hand &amp; I thought I saw the word "clues" on it,so I told my husband that &amp; when we passed by them again my husband asked if they were doing a scavenger hunt &amp; they were liek yeah,so I asked if they were letterboxing &amp; she said,"yes!"She said she was from California visiting her sister in Ohio.I never imagined I would meet up with a letterboxer,especially since I had no idea there were letterboxes exactly where we were...it was a last minute little trip &amp; I didn't have anything with us to do the hunt,but at least next time I will know if we ever go back there again. :) Also wanted to mention that I am in SE Michigan,Canton,to be exact.We would love to meet other letterboxers in our area. :)<br/>
