                    <div class="plaintext-content">0n February 21,2002 Funhog placed the 'I'iwi Letterbox at Maunawili Falls<br/>
near Kailua on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. This is a shady rainforest trail<br/>
that ends at a hidden waterfall. Bring water as you will be climbing a lot<br/>
of steps along the way. The roundtrip is 2.6 miles.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: From Honolulu head towards Kailua on the Pali<br/>
Highway/route 61. At the SECOND Auloa intersection turn right. Take the<br/>
left fork (high road) immediately after you turn. This will put you on<br/>
Maunawili Rd. Stay on this road until it ends at Kelewina. Park on Kelewina<br/>
and walk back downhill to the trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: At the fork go downstairs. When you come to the next<br/>
stream crossing it can be a little difficult to see the trail. Head<br/>
upstream at 130 degrees magnetic on the right side of the river. Shortly,<br/>
you will see the trail once again. The falls are just ahead. Once you've<br/>
enjoyed the tranquility of this lovely spot head back the way you came.<br/>
Cross the first stream you come to, stand on the bank and look for four<br/>
rainforest giants at 60 degrees. Head for a fallen brother at their feet.<br/>
The letterbox is eight steps from the brother's head at 25 degrees nestled<br/>
between a butress and bamboo, a rock on top.<br/>
