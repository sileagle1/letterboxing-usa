                    <div class="plaintext-content">We finished day 1!!! Happy to see a couple of boxers out there <br/>
lifting our spirits and keeping us company . We did an impressive 6-7 <br/>
miles. Boys , oxen and Moms are tired.  Wait a minute our oxen never <br/>
tired they pushed all day, and Timmy had energy to play and run <br/>
around after. My feet are tired and the arm that kept pushing the hug <br/>
happy Scooby off my back pocket. <br/>
    NOW  Sunday.  We have decided to do a half day and let little Al <br/>
the youngest rest more . We will have nice Fathers Day mornings that <br/>
way too. So we will be at the Kenyon Rd. Hampton trail crossing  12-1 <br/>
heading down to Goodwin Forest nature Center where we will end for <br/>
the day. We only made about a mile each hour due to resting Al. So 3-<br/>
4 at Goodwin would be expected. There are a couple boxes there too. <br/>
  See you on the road tommorow.    Carol Leader of the pack and for <br/>
this week oxen teamster. <br/>
