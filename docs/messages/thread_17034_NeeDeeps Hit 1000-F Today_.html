&gt;<br/>
&gt;Today Kathy and I went out and did a few boxes to hit a 1000-F even though <br/>
&gt;the weather was not the greatest we had a good time anyway.We did the Eagle <br/>
&gt;mystery box then the Christmas mystery box,I thought we were all done for <br/>
&gt;the day there,1 hour and 75 dollars later I finally got Kathy out of <br/>
&gt;there.Then we did boxes 2 &amp; 3 of the Cranked Lebanon series,hopped down the <br/>
&gt;road and did the Firebird at Gay City park, then seeing how we were in <br/>
&gt;search of 1000,we hit 1000 on in search of Chuck Straub.Both stamps were <br/>
&gt;very nicely done,we even picked up a HH today, Betsey Beagle while stamping <br/>
&gt;the new stamp at the Hidden Cemetery Series.Not a bad day,Happy Trails.The <br/>

WOW a 1000 Finds.  I remember the day you first told me about <br/>
letterboxing.  The stories of your first letterbox find and now <br/>
1000.  Way to go and hope you hit a 1000 more.  Teach &amp; Preach<br/>

&gt; Dear NeeDeeps,<br/>
  A big congratulations to you! I've never responded<br/>
on this site before, but have seen your stamp in Maine<br/>
and felt prodded to send you best wishes! It seems<br/>
that I also received good new from responding-- Betsey<br/>
Beagle is my HH and I have been wondering where she<br/>
may be! Many thanks for the news and happy hunting for<br/>
the next 1000!<br/>
<br/>
Most sincerely,<br/>
"Folllow the Son"<br/>
Cornville, Maine<br/>
