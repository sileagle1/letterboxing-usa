he exclaimed. "I trust your trip from St. Louis went well?"<br/>
<br/>
"As well as can be expected, dear William," beamed Meriwether. "'A<br/>
merit sent north is better than south', as they say!"<br/>
<br/>
"Well, you're just in time for our momentous journey!" William rubbed<br/>
his eyes and sighed. "This sweltering heat is doing nothing for my<br/>
study of quills. Let's enjoy this fine river city, and enjoy a cup of<br/>
coffee, or maybe some tea."<br/>
<br/>
Meriwether clapped his hand on William's shoulder. "I know just the<br/>
place, across the street!"<br/>
<br/>
The two men left and stepped onto the sidewalk, the large hall looming<br/>
high above them. As a carriage rumbled past, they strolled across the<br/>
cobbled street and into the welcoming shade of the shop's ecclectic<br/>
interior.<br/>
<br/>
"I say, Meriwether," said William. "Is this a teahouse or a book<br/>
merchant?"<br/>
<br/>
Meriwether walked to the counter, and in a proud voice ordered a<br/>
"Wedded Bliss." The storekeeper nodded, smiled knowingly at<br/>
Meriwether, and reached under the counter.<br/>
<br/>
"A little of both," replied Meriwether, as he winked at William.<br/>
