We discovered letterboxing in January of 2001, and decided to call our group The Jersey Devils.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Much to our surprise, a boxer (Randy Hall) planted a box also called, Jersey Devil, which we took as an omen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We started our research of the JD box from February through April and then continued from September through November 17th, 2001, when we finally found the box.  What an accomplishment; since this was our first box to find.  We did indeed post this first find as to notify other boxers that there was hope in tracking down Randys difficult boxes.  We also found his Time Traveler box and are now on the hunt for Calico Honeymoon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Reading Randys post with regard to the NJ/PA Summit, we were sorry to hear he may have given out hints to his boxes when he wrote hope I didnt give too much away about those Pine Barren Boxes since finding them as we did would be a more fulfilling accomplishment.<br/>
<br/>
Once we decided to explore other NJ boxes, we were disappointed to learn the ease of the clues.  This hobby is for all to enjoy and we understand the need for the different level of boxes; we knew we needed to search out the advanced boxes, which take on the views of Dartmoor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We also decided to post our first find of the Dos Pelicanos en el Sol found in Florida.  Again, since this box required a boat rental, in which we never drove a boat, our posting was to inform others that anything is possible.<br/>

I certainly do not mind reading about other's accomplishments of <br/>
being the first finders of box, or even other adventures, good and <br/>
bad, that folks have had searching and finding or not letterboxes.  <br/>
That's one of the main reasons I come to this board.<br/>
<br/>
The first box you speak of actually introduced me to letterboxing <br/>
when I was doing a search on the New Jersey Devils and happened upon <br/>
the Mapsurfers letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
In regards to box quality, I think that is all up to the planters of <br/>
the boxes.  Each &amp; every box that is planted does take quite a bit of <br/>
time and effort as everyone knows who has planted one.  Not all boxes <br/>
are going to be to everyone's likening.  However some folks enjoy the <br/>
more difficult while others just love finding new stamps, as I'm sure <br/>
there are a thousand other reasons folks choose to letterbox.  We all <br/>
have our own favorite part of this pastime.  <br/>

&gt; Believe you're right, Cheryl.  It's a courtesy to notify the one who<br/>
&gt; placed the letterbox of your find, especially since he or she may not<br/>
&gt; find out by revisiting the box for some time - if ever.  I leave<br/>
&gt; several postal cards and my e-mail address to facilitate this, and<br/>
&gt; sometimes I do hear.  But saying too much about it here in a public<br/>
&gt; post may give away too much about a box's location, or otherwise<br/>
&gt; detract from someone else's pleasure in a find.  Not always,<br/>
&gt; tho . . . I like to hear of the exploits of others - up to a point,<br/>
&gt; so long it doesn't descend into bragging.<br/>
