Guess he figured that it was time to stop pretending that he wasn't interested in the hobby- considering he'd carved his own stamp.<br/>
<br/>
The box was alive and well, and I wanted to drop a quick note saying what a smile it gave me to see the stamps of people I've spoken to from this list.  It's an odd bond, this, and one that you wouldn't really think mattered, but it was nice to see the marks of you all!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
