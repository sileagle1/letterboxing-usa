I was looking at the web site and noticed that you have "The Pumpkin"<br/>
as missing. Could you remove this statement from the clues the box was<br/>
replaced in October 2002. And I went out to the boxes and checked on<br/>
them today and they are all there and ready for spring hunters. But<br/>
you will have to where boots the river is high and the low lands are<br/>
flooded you can get around them but it is muddy. You may want to wait<br/>
for the river to go down.<br/>
Thanks to all who make this happen,<br/>
