Carter County<br/>
Roan Mountain, TN<br/>
Sir William was a brave knight. He had conquered many dragons in <br/>
England, but his fair Lady Samantha was not impressed. He decided to <br/>
come to the New World to find more dangerous and challenging dragons <br/>
to fight. He had heard of the Catawba rhododendron. It sounded like a <br/>
fierce and furious dragon to him! He read that the habitat of the <br/>
Catawba Rhododendron were wet woods, swamps, bogs, and in moist <br/>
mountains. One of the characteristics of this terrible thing was that <br/>
it may attain a height of 30-40 feet!<br/>
<br/>
Sir William made the arduous journey across the Atlantic and over <br/>
land until he reached Roan Mountain, Tennessee. He had heard that <br/>
there was a garden at the top of Roan Mountain that was just full of <br/>
the Catawba rhododendron!!<br/>
<br/>
Once at the top of the mountain, he discovered that the Rhododendron <br/>
was nothing more than a flowering shrubbery! Like any good Knight of <br/>
Ni, he figured that this would surely impress Lady Samantha and he <br/>
decided to take it back to her! Since his journey had reached such a <br/>
satisfying conclusion, he decided to reward himself by staying at the <br/>
Cloudland Hotel at the top of the mountain. If you stand in front of <br/>
the information sign at the Cloudland Hotel and go 15 steps at 60 <br/>
degrees. There you will find the helmet that Sir William left behind <br/>
after his quest was over!<br/>
