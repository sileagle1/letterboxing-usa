the wonderful  (good job, Jay!) new Happiness stamp and <br/>
reaching my 1000 PFX! Happiness really led to more happiness, <br/>
if you know what I mean!<br/>
<br/>
Today we went with Lobsta to Coventry and Mansfield, getting <br/>
almost 20 boxes, including the 3 hitchhikers we found: Winter <br/>
Wheat, Come Home Snoopy and It Only Takes a Spark - soon to <br/>
be re-released on a trail near you! Ice and snow-packed boxes <br/>
were not too much for us...we brought our handy dandy whammy <br/>
bar and chipped, pried and poked them loose.  Won't Spring <br/>
boxing seem easy after these winter adventures?<br/>
<br/>
Keep your eyes open; we are planting tomorrow!<br/>
