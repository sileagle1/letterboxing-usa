<br/>
--Planted "The Transformed Man"--with a plea for help to the So Cal Boxing community, I <br/>
am very concerned about the location the box is in...the best I could do at the time, but <br/>
possibly a REALLY BAD location for a VERY GOOD stamp<br/>
<br/>
--Visited Buzzard's Halloween Series for the second time, and picked up Suicide Bridge <br/>
and Scaredy Cat.  For the life of me, I couldn;t find the Rialto Theatre AGAIN!!!!  What is <br/>
wrong with me???  Wasn't sure if memorial Park Moon was there still or not.  So I am 4 of <br/>
6, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
--Attempted "Two Cats and a Troll" in Griffith Park, and foudn the bridge, but not the box.  <br/>
Boo.<br/>
<br/>
--Did the Coldwater Canyon Series and found boxes #1 and #4.  #2 and #3 appear to be <br/>
missing according to log entries in #4.  Nice, buggy hike in an unexpected area.  Also <br/>
picked up Santa's Travels HH as a nice surprise.<br/>
<br/>
So, can't complain, really pleased with the results for a quick trip...my found count goes <br/>
up to 28, which is only 72 away from 100.<br/>
