Harry's Secret Wizard Cache in O'Fallon was inaccessible because the park <br/>

On Monday, I'll tackle SW Illinois....<br/>

                    <html><body>Silent Doug,  Awesome a new area letterboxer.  Can I ask if you are from the area or just passing through?<br/>
<br/>
Just so you know ....the ETP letterbox Series is out of commission due to vandalism.  ETP#3 box is permanently there but the contents are missing.<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I look forward to running into you and possibly exchanging stamp images.<br/>
<br/>
How was Turtle Park, by the way?  It was fine the last time I checked on it...amazingly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your note,<br/>
Mohmers<br/>
