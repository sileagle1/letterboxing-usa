<br/>
I don't know what happens to foam board over the long term, that's <br/>
kind of the reason I'm sealing the edges with the Gel Medium.<br/>
<br/>
This craft foam idea sounds like something I'll try when I use up <br/>
this piece of foam board.  Or maybe I'll see if I can find some and <br/>
use it on the stamps that will be going into boxes that will planted <br/>
where I won't be checking on them as often<br/>
<br/>
I love how sharing ideas and creativity begets sharing ideas and <br/>
creativity.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Does foam board disintegrate if it gets wet?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To avoid the mounting tantrum I have used the 3/4"thickness<br/>
MasterCarve carving block. This material stands alone on thickness<br/>
avoiding the need to mount. This works well depending on the amount of<br/>
use you think the stamp/box will see. If it's got to be durable, this<br/>
option will eventually wear down faster with use as the material gives.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you've got to mount, because you've carved using the<br/>
relatively thin speedy stamp (pink stuff) then I would use aspen<br/>
boards from Home Depot. You can also purchase Balsa Wood cheap at a<br/>
craft or hobby shop.<br/>
<br/>
I would be wary of mounting on foam core/board. It is not 100% paper<br/>
based product, but definitely crushes and even with a sealed acrylic<br/>
coating could disintegrate over time - again, this depends upon use.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, coating with modgepodge and sealing with a spray acrylic<br/>
fix is a good idea. Best of luck on mounting. I always liked the idea<br/>
of mounting the stamp to the inkpad cover. This wouldn't work if you<br/>
had to throw out the ink pad later...<br/>
