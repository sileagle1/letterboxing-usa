                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I'm caught up on my mail now :-) Having "keepers of the boxes" <br/>
will have the same effect as what I proposed below. With the personal <br/>
travelers, each person would be responsible for their own stamp(s), <br/>
with no possibility of an "unknown container" being found. It would <br/>
encourage exchanges too! <br/>
Either way should work safely. <br/>
Here's another idea- If there are people over there who just like to <br/>
carve (but not place) stamps, they could send their stamps state side <br/>
to be planted in their name. I'm sure there are plenty of <br/>
letterboxers here that would be happy to 'adopt' the placement &amp; care <br/>
of a stamp sent to them. They could even collect and return the box <br/>
when the sender gets state side.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few thoughts,<br/>

if you<br/>

&gt; &gt; Point well taken. Each person is entitled to his/her own opinion <br/>
on the<br/>
&gt; matter. Some may say that it is a good idea, whereas others may <br/>
tend to<br/>
&gt; think it not such a good idea.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So....LetterBoxers of the list.....What do you all think?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 1. Does is sound like a decent, if not a great, idea...?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2. Does is sound like an idea that is asking for trouble and <br/>
wasting<br/>
&gt; precious resources and man/woman hours?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to hear the masses ideas on this one....<br/>
