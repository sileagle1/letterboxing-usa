response to your challege, all we can say is, we're working on it!  <br/>
Of the 17 we've planted, only three are out of the state, the rest <br/>
are within two hours of us (make sure you check out the NY mystery <br/>
boxes as well).  We will continue to do as many more as we can.  <br/>
We've found most of them in the area at this point, so nothing to do <br/>
but hide them now.  We join catbead in urging all NYLBs (New York <br/>
Letterboxers) to do the same!<br/>

That's why I'm thinking late August. The parks here are very packed during <br/>

at the end of August, park-goers become less numerous.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I plan on coming down 07/04 for the dance, and to do a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;boxing before hand. At this late date, I doubt I could get a site<br/>
at one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;of the State Parks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That's why I'm thinking late August. The parks here are very packed<br/>
during<br/>
&gt; &gt;the summer, but by the time Cornell and Ithaca College start back<br/>
up again<br/>
&gt; &gt;at the end of August, park-goers become less numerous.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I'll post again about it next month to see who else might be<br/>
interested,<br/>
&gt; &gt;but for now I'll throw out August 24th for consideration, somewhere<br/>
in Ithaca.<br/>
