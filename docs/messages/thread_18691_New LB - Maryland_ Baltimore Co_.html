of "Brood X" Cicadas due to arrive in the area this month!<br/>
<br/>
Start at the NCR Trail in Sparks, MD (part of the Gunpowder Falls <br/>
State Park: take York Road north of Shawan Road to Sparks. Turn <br/>
right on Sparks Road. Go less than 1 mile to parking lot). Take the <br/>
trail to the south for .6 mile.<br/>
<br/>
You will see a small trail to the left that leads to an old quarry <br/>
(it looks like a large rock wall). Take this trail -- its only a few <br/>
feet to the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Follow the rock wall (be careful of old pieces of metal on the <br/>
ground!). Where the rock wall begins to curve, look for two large <br/>
trees with a smaller tree between them. The box is under some rocks <br/>
at the base of the small tree.<br/>
<br/>
The NCR trail used to be a rail road that has been converted into a <br/>
trail.  Mostly level, great for biking, hiking, running, whatever.<br/>
