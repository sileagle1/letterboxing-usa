Visited the Asa Pond and the Great Swamp Monument and both were in great condition.  It's a good thing I never forgot the balance beam acts from my childhood definitely did not want to land in the mud. ;-)  And thank you for the Monument Box.  I'm always amazed at the places I would have never gone otherwise if not for this fantastic hobby.<br/>

rank right up there as some of my favorites.  I could<br/>
just picture Laurettes girl's finding places for the<br/>
Asa pond boxes and the stamps are so cute! Those were<br/>
the last boxes Tig and I picked up on a particularly<br/>
long day of boxing.  We almost didn't stop but I'm so<br/>
very glad we did. :o)  The Great Swamp one was a<br/>
definite favorite of mine, not only for the stamp but<br/>
for the location as well...it's a great place that is<br/>
significant to my family's history as well. <br/>
<br/>
To think I never knew it was there and that's what's<br/>
so cool about letterboxing! <br/>

we had the right tree, but we moved on and found the next one in <br/>
good shape.  Great weather to be out walking.  Nice temperature, no <br/>
bugs! (except for 1 tick) and NO HUNTING!!  <br/>

I would really like to go back and get the rest of the boxes!<br/>
