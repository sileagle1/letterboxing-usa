 Teddy<br/>
<br/>
 Begin with the Americans and then head North to the Polar region.  We're <br/>
talking about bears ... not directions.  After watching Whitey frolic in the <br/>
water take 42  (six year old) strides toward the NE Kiener Memorial Entrance. <br/>
  Watch out for trains.<br/>
 After your strides, stop and turn left.  Sit down under the spreading tree <br/>
on the knoll and take a rest and a drink.  You'll find Teddy waiting there <br/>
for you in the forks of the tree.  Please be sure to cover him back up with <br/>
leaves.<br/>
<br/>
 This is a micro box.  A black and gray film canister.  It holds nothing but <br/>
a note and a stamp.  To log in, please go to the website listed below.  :o)<br/>

 "Close it TIght"<br/>
<br/>
Begin at the west end of the stone bridge between the land of the apes and <br/>
the Herpetarium.  Head North for 31 (eight year old) strides. Turn left at <br/>
the path that heads over the grassy knoll. Sit down under the small tree <br/>
behind the benches to the left side of the path and get out a snack or a <br/>
drink and watch the show (if it is feeding time).  "Close it Tight" will be <br/>
sitting in the forks of the tree tightly SEAL-ed.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 This is a micro box.  A black and gray film canister.  It holds nothing but <br/>

We are counting on you to put it back , well hidden, to avoid it being <br/>
mistaken for litter.  Depending on the time of day, this is a busy spot!<br/>

  RAJA<br/>
<br/>
Follow the River's Edge! <br/>
Locate Raja's Trail and the WildLife Ranger Station/Hut.  <br/>
Locate the large flat rock to the NORTHWEST of the hut  (NOT SOUTHWEST). <br/>
 A great place to sit in-con-spi-u-pous-ly and rest and watch for elephants.  <br/>
Are you tired?  <br/>
Great, lean back and stretch.  (about 2 feet south)  <br/>
What?<br/>
 A small tree? <br/>
Imagine that.  <br/>
u'll find Our RAJA at the base of this small tree between its forks.<br/>

  ROAR !<br/>
<br/>
Find Big Cat Country!  Find the spot where you can look westward through an <br/>
opening in the rocks over a very short railing and see Marlin Perkins, a <br/>
train station and the tigers' pond.  Set your things down on the planter <br/>
within arms reach (to the north).  Oops ! You must have dropped something <br/>
into the planter.  Don't worry, you'll find it ... reach way back behind the <br/>
day lillies ... ROAR!<br/>
 (west corner).<br/>
<br/>
 This is a micro box, not as small as the others.   It does hold  a very <br/>
small logbook and two stamps.  To log in on line, please go to the website <br/>

The Longest Neck  <br/>
<br/>
Locate the open air enclosure for these long necked animals.  Amazing aren't <br/>
they?  We have fond memories of the kids here.  :o)  Back up away from the <br/>
crowd that gathers there until you are near a fence and can see the crevice <br/>
leading to the very tall stall door... approx. 10-1/2 (eight year old) <br/>
strides.  At 101 degrees you should be lined up with a tree and the crevice <br/>
and be standing beside a fence near the donkey-ish animal.  Look down a small <br/>
flat rock should be there (and an amazing rolling fence rail that the kids <br/>
discovered!).  Set your stuff down over the fence next to the rock and lift <br/>
up the rock.  The Longest Neck should be there!<br/>
