Only problem would be that you'd have to tape a flat head screwdriver <br/>
to the side of it to open it.  Do you how effective a flat head <br/>
screwdriver (regardless of its size) is as a weapon?  (unless it's <br/>
against me - I come to you with only karate, my empty hands, I have <br/>
no weapons ... but if it should be a matter of defending myself .... <br/>
be it a matter of life or death .... then here are my weapons, <br/>
karate, my empty hands) (and an attitude)<br/>
<br/>
And even assuming that all letterboxers or those intrepid souls to <br/>
happy to stumble upon them unwittingly, are are really pussycats, the <br/>
tape holding it on would not last more than a month.  Even duct <br/>
tape.  The duct tape would survive, but not the adhesive.<br/>

Barring that, you'd have to assume that all letterboxers carry a) a <br/>
flat head screwdrive and/or b a roll of duct tape.  Big assumption.<br/>
