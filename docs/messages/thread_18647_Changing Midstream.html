between Finds and HHs being seperate.  I am counting these up as <br/>
most people do...this will now increase my find count and I will no <br/>
longer need different books at gatherings either!! For all of you <br/>
who put up with this kookiness, I thank you :0) The first rule of <br/>
LB'ing (even though there are no rules): Be Organized! (That's B.O.)<br/>
<br/>
Some one mailed me saying they have stamped into my new box. I hope <br/>
some of you will consider stopping by. It is about 5 miles off the <br/>
Kingston exit on the NYS thruway...and there are other stamps in the <br/>
area. Plant seeds. Add fertilizer, water and watch things grow. :0)<br/>
<br/>
Take care out there<br/>
