<br/>
Unsavory? UNSAVORY ! ?<br/>
<br/>
I admit to nothing except an obviously heighter sense of fashion <br/>
that you call costumes and disguises. (When have you EVER seen me in <br/>
anything but an Erje original?)<br/>
<br/>
I'm warning you, Verde Tortellini, if that inspector Pork Frank, <br/>
comes snooping around my chocolate starfish, (huh, that's <br/>
funny, .... now I'm hungry) ... what was I saying?<br/>
<br/>
I would have responded immediately had not my dear sister fainted in <br/>
despair, finding that another scandal was being thrown willy-nilly <br/>
at a Hedge family member. This libelous casting of aspersion upon my <br/>
good name is enough to make me follow my dear sister's flaming <br/>
descent into the madness of an emotional breakdown. (My goodness! <br/>
The thought just occurred to me, is this a hereditary trait?) <br/>
Instead, I'll simply reach for the flask, sharpen my nails and let <br/>
loose.<br/>
<br/>
IF you've ever read Variety, or Show Business Weekly, seen me at <br/>
Carnegie Hall, Stockholm, D.C., or heard me on various CDs, you'd <br/>
know that I'm VERY active in the theatre and barely have time for a <br/>
breath between shows, let alone enough time to scrape off all the <br/>
makeup. (I still get odd looks at work.) Unfortunately it is my <br/>
habit to keep quite a few irons in the fire.<br/>
<br/>
For example,<br/>
*I'm in the middle of rehearsals for the Kennedy Center (with <br/>
Barbara Cook - no, she's not dead.)<br/>
*Rehearsals for Seussical at the Apollo (not Harlem's),<br/>
*I volunteered to make my own (slimming) Horton the Elephant costume<br/>
*A large (tastefully nude) acryllic reproduction of Paul <br/>
Cadmus' "The Bath"<br/>
*Sewing 'Lucky' shirts for a friend (Oh, the things I'll do for <br/>
money)<br/>
*Compose new Prissmas Carols ( Prissmas is THIS SATURDAY ! The <br/>
holiday dedicated to "I told you so.")<br/>
*Drink to forget.<br/>
*Drive by Martha Stewart's at night and plant trailer trash lawn <br/>
ornaments (she hates that!)<br/>
*Resort my wigs to Miss Clairol's new number matching system<br/>
*Gut the kitchen<br/>
*Hide more boxes from Wanda<br/>
*Clean the basement<br/>
*Advance the Homosexual Agenda<br/>
<br/>
What's that, 13 projects off the top of my head? When the heck would <br/>
I have time to snag somebody's PZCut? (Der Mad Who?)<br/>
<br/>
Apart from the fact that I know exactly who (I mean what) I was <br/>
doing at the time this 'crime?' occurred, (using Stealthboxer's <br/>
logic - if I say I'm a speckled iquana, you'll just have to believe <br/>
that I am), I don't even know that I've ever even touched PZCut. It <br/>
distastfully sounds like something to do with a Briss (Ewww! and <br/>
Ow ! ) AND, speaking of brisses, I use the grey stuff from <br/>
DickBlick.com anyway, (it's inexpensive, and the company name is <br/>
strangely appealing.<br/>
<br/>
AND, come to think of it, being so, so busy as I am, it has occurred <br/>
to me if someone were trying to sully my name, I think I know who it <br/>
could be.  I "accidentally" renamed control freak, Sewsowbizzy, by <br/>
calling her "So So Bossy" at the Letterboxing Pub Crawl last <br/>
January. (I was also wearing a handsewn fabulous official pub crawl <br/>
shirt - she was SO envious of the sewing skill) I guess she wasn't <br/>
as far into her cups at the time as I thought. (I'm still surprised <br/>
she remembers ANYthing.) Framing me is just like something she would <br/>
do as revenge. (I guess I would too if my only fabulous accessory <br/>
were a red hat.) If she thinks it'll work, then she's So SO Dizzy! <br/>
I'm going to have to give her a piece of my mind.<br/>
<br/>
Motive? She's upset I called her So So Bossy and jealous that I'm <br/>
more fabulous than she is. Opportunity? Who the heck knows? She's <br/>
part of a national female organization that has opperatives all over <br/>
the place.<br/>
<br/>
Poison Ivy<br/>
<br/>
P.S. AND How COULD anyone trust anything from someone named GREEN<br/>
TORTUGA? I mean, what even IS that? Humph! <br/>

&gt; &gt; January. (I was also wearing a handsewn fabulous<br/>
&gt; official pub crawl <br/>
&gt; &gt; shirt - she was SO envious of the sewing skill) I<br/>
&gt; guess she wasn't <br/>
&gt; &gt; as far into her cups at the time as I thought.<br/>
&gt; (I'm still surprised <br/>
&gt; &gt; she remembers ANYthing.) Framing me is just like<br/>
&gt; something she would <br/>
&gt; &gt; do as revenge. (I guess I would too if my only<br/>
&gt; fabulous accessory <br/>
&gt; &gt; were a red hat.) If she thinks it'll work, then<br/>
&gt; she's So SO Dizzy! <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm going to have to give her a piece of my mind.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Motive? She's upset I called her So So Bossy and<br/>
&gt; jealous that I'm <br/>
&gt; &gt; more fabulous than she is. Opportunity? Who the<br/>
&gt; heck knows? She's <br/>
&gt; &gt; part of a national female organization that has<br/>
&gt; opperatives all over <br/>
&gt; &gt; the place.<br/>

&gt; someone named GREEN<br/>

<br/>
Changing Locations  <http: 8264="" group="" groups.yahoo.com="" lbma="" message=""><br/>
 a week later I went to Delaware and used the Lewis Library<br/>
computer  after emptying my wallet to purchase an out-of-stater<br/>
library card - cause they don't take American Express - VISA,<br/>
Mastercard, Discover . . .and neither did the Bait &amp; Tackle Shop where<br/>
the annual pass to the DE State Parks sucked up another fifty four<br/>
dollars, and all this expense after having to pay cash to get across the<br/>
Chesapeake Bay Bridge/Tunnel cuss they don't take EZPass!<br/>
<br/>
There is no way I could have driven with quite literally only one dollar<br/>
on my person from VA via DE, thru MD, WV, OH, IN, IL, IA, NE, WY and ID<br/>
to arrive 11 states away in OR. Besides it would have taken me a month<br/>
of Sundays to print all those mappoint.msn.com maps with all turns shown<br/>
and every letterbox enroute carefully mapped for the most efficient most<br/>
boxious journey of my life.  Not to mention, at my clueless pace I'd<br/>
still be in WV - - where my fashionably challenged acusser has taken up<br/>
residence and name calling.<br/>
<br/>
No sooner have I regained my demure composure after the slam that I<br/>
might be part of a RedHat Box'r gang, well not in just those words,<br/>
but I felt that was what was meant; than I am indirectly acussed via my<br/>
other affiliation. Yes, I was the last to join the Baker's Dozen and<br/>
had I know then where such an unlucky number would landed me in the LB<br/>
community I . . . would have gone anyway because I have a Dartmoor One<br/>
Hundred Patch and that is worth more to me than any amount of PZ White<br/>
Stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I recently bought the last of the PZ Orange Stuff --- ooops, I<br/>
wasn't suppose let that slip. But I need it for carving the MonyLoop<br/>
State Stamps and all the bonus boxes that will be part of the "It's<br/>
Just a Game" gather in Killens Pond State Park, Felton DE in October.<br/>
Check it out on http://de-games.tripod.com/<br/>
<http: de-games.tripod.com=""></http:>  and sign-up on AQ . . . Hey! I'm not the<br/>
only one with a plug and no shame!<br/>
<br/>
I've been home for a few hours now and have given this caper a whole<br/>
lot of thought - after I unloaded the car, got the tomatos planted, went<br/>
through two weeks of mail, fixed dinner, and read three days worth of PZ<br/>
Caper posts. Now, I can't imagine anyone of the LBMA persuasion<br/>
being so dastardly (except maybe someone who makes others crawl) as to<br/>
steal a complete cache of PZ White Stuff. So I looked beyond and<br/>
eliminated anyone from LBNE, as they are way too serious to violate any<br/>
of the LB commandments, including not coveting thy neighbors PZ White<br/>
Stuff. Now, I have traveled to the LBSE and part took of a gather in<br/>
Charlotte, and have even boxed in GA, AL and FL. They seem to be really<br/>
nice folk and not prone to using PZ White Stuff. Since I hope to return<br/>
next year my suspicions must be directed further away . . . from any<br/>
face to face retaliation. Hmmmm, Texas is a big state doing things in<br/>
big ways --- like taking ALL the PZ white stuff, not just enough for a<br/>
dozen stamps or so. There sure are a lot of members on AQ, but one name<br/>
that jumps out from Texas is that Barefoot Lucy gal. Seems she has stuff<br/>
under her bed that she's not talking about. And what's with the<br/>
bare feet? Sneaking around so she won't be heard??<br/>
<br/>
And get this, she has a hobby of storytelling . . . sounds more like a<br/>
habit and I'm sure she's going to tell us a big one! Better get<br/>
Inspector Frankfurter on her trail quick!<br/>

<br/>
I can NOT believe I was just brought into this whole fiasco!  I've been<br/>
slaving away at my computer these past couple days trying to put the last<br/>
minute details on a campout for 150 of my favorite cub scouts and their<br/>
dads, and my only entertainment has been reading the twists and turns of the<br/>
PZ Cut saga, and now I'M called to question?  I want to clear my name as<br/>
quickly as possible.  I simply cannot go away for the weekend with my name<br/>
under scrutiny!<br/>
<br/>
Let me state this as clearly as possible:  I was nowhere around Der Mad<br/>
Stamper's house at midnight, although I do admit I complained about him at<br/>
the karaoke bar earlier in the evening!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You see, I spent the winter carving stamps and making boxes and I've spent<br/>
every night dreaming of where I would put them all once Spring came.  My<br/>
dreams were cut short when last Friday my husband (who isn't a letterboxer<br/>
and thus can hardly understand the significance of all that rubber-laced<br/>
Tupperware!)  gave me until the end of this weekend to get rid of all my<br/>
precious creations or he was going to sell them on eBay (curse that KMartha<br/>
post  it gave him the idea!) or even worse in our garage sale next weekend!<br/>
I could hardly stand the thought of some garage sale scavenger buying my<br/>
beautiful boxes for a nickel apiece so her kid could teethe on them or the<br/>
dog could buries bones in them or some equally hideous demise,  so I set out<br/>
Friday at the crack of noon and started planting, and planting, and<br/>
planting.  In fact, I planted until dark and long after, stopping only once<br/>
to have a drink or six and listen to some good karaoke.  After I finished my<br/>
last drink, I decided the drinks weren't making that karaoke-singing DMS guy<br/>
sound any better, so I complained to the manager that he needed to audition<br/>
folk before he let them sing and I joined the horde of other people escaping<br/>
from the bar and got back to my planting.  I was beginning to see light on<br/>
the horizon when I got the last box planted  21 in all!  I had placed all<br/>
those boxes in less than one day!   They are scattered across thirteen parks<br/>
in six towns, but I got them all planted  every last one of them!  And I<br/>
did all that planting on my bicycle, so there is no WAY I could've been the<br/>
culprit  bikes don't screech tires and DMS's stash of PZ Kut is far too<br/>
massive to carry on a bike besides!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even though no one saw me planting boxes at midnight and beyond, that's what<br/>
I was doing!  My husband can tell you there were boxes strewn across our<br/>
kitchen table yesterday and there are none there today, and once I<br/>
eventually get them posted, you will find them all safely tucked away, at<br/>
least until some boozing raccoon smells the tequila that I spilled all over<br/>
myself and then spread to the boxes and destroys them to get to the liquor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SO  Sewsobizzy   you shouldn't speak out of turn!  If you want to be<br/>
helpful, why don't you mention that it could've been Spring Chick  she HAS<br/>
been planning a trip to the Northwest for quite awhile now, but then, I<br/>
don't think everyone knew about THAT!<br/>

  I've been thinking about WHY someone would steal DMS's carving material. And I've come to the conclusion that it was revenge, pure and simple. <br/>
    A believe it will become a serial of revenge thefts, perpetrated on all our 'Boxing Forefathers (and Foremothers). <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well yes, I did take a trip on the weekend in question (but not to <br/>
the Pacific NW)...  and I was even buried in white stuff, but I am <br/>
afraid it was not the beloved PZKut, rather it was snow!  Yes, you <br/>
heard me correct (this is Michigan, after all)!  OldShoe and I were <br/>
planning a trip to Chicago for a concert and decided to take the <br/>
long way, through the U.P. so I could stop in Door County, WI as I <br/>
had placed a box there last fall and lost the clues and wanted <br/>
desperately to check on the box and make new clues.  Once we got <br/>
across the Mackinac Bridge and into the U.P., it began snowing like <br/>
I have never seen -- wet, heavy snow, making driving quite <br/>
treacherous.  It was so bad we had to spend the night in question in <br/>
the little town of Gulliver at a quaint little bed and breakfast <br/>
just up the road from the Haunted Lighthouse at Seul Choix Point.  <br/>
We awoke the next morning to find everything covered with white (no <br/>
not PZKut, snow)!  At least 10 inches of snow had fallen!  Despite <br/>
the snow, we continued on our way to Chicago and once the sun came <br/>
up, the snow completely melted in less than an hour -- I bet a lot <br/>
of people living up there never even knew it had snowed!<br/>
<br/>
So you see, I was buried in snow in the remote north of Michigan and <br/>
could not possibly have stolen Mr. Stamper's PZKut.  This does seem <br/>
curious to me though, because upon my return home from Chicago, I <br/>
purchased a lot of white PZKut from E-Bay.  I was overjoyed to see <br/>
it for sale and was willing to pay the steep price and for express <br/>
shipping.  As a matter of fact, I was just mentioning the other day <br/>
that the first thing I did with my new PZKut was make a new Personal <br/>
Traveler for myself -- it carved like a dream!<br/>
<br/>
Upon learning of the missing carving material, I considered that <br/>
perhaps I had purchased stolen goods.  I checked the auction details <br/>
more carefully and even wrote to the seller asking where they had <br/>
obtained this lot of PZKut.  I have not heard back from the seller, <br/>
whose ID was TGD_Brian.  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  Yes, <br/>
exactly! and I find it quite peculiar that the person in question <br/>
has been silent since the heist...  perhaps this should be more <br/>
thoroughly investigated...<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even though no one saw me planting boxes at midnight and beyond, <br/>
that's what<br/>
&gt; I was doing!  My husband can tell you there were boxes strewn <br/>
across our<br/>
&gt; kitchen table yesterday and there are none there today, and once I<br/>
&gt; eventually get them posted, you will find them all safely tucked <br/>
away, at<br/>
&gt; least until some boozing raccoon smells the tequila that I spilled <br/>
all over<br/>
&gt; myself and then spread to the boxes and destroys them to get to <br/>
the liquor.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SO  Sewsobizzy   you shouldn't speak out of turn!  If you want <br/>
to be<br/>
&gt; helpful, why don't you mention that it could've been Spring Chick <br/>
 she HAS<br/>
&gt; been planning a trip to the Northwest for quite awhile now, but <br/>
then, I<br/>
&gt; don't think everyone knew about THAT!<br/>

Day have been nutty for our Mr. Pepe?  That is, if he truly is a bean<br/>
counter?  How could he have found the time to do anything but push paper? <br/>
I wonder how he manages to be so involved with letterboxing at this time<br/>
of year.  Is this an alibi or a defense?  I'm waiting to see what happens<br/>
next.<br/>

And by the way, it's been great not having other earth-shattering threads<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is getting more frustrating all the time! It's been a week since <br/>
I saw my beautiful Grade A white PZ Kuts. My house seems so empty and <br/>
lonely without them, and nothing seems to be going my way lately...<br/>
<br/>
This morning, I mistakenly poured Cocoa Pebbles into the puffer fish <br/>
bowl and put my poor kitty into the snake cage. And yesterday I <br/>
accidentally killed all my pink tulips with a golf club. So, on top <br/>
of everything else, I guess I'm going to have to go buy a new five-<br/>
iron now.<br/>
<br/>
My neighbor lady bought new extra-thick drapes and installed bars on <br/>
the outside of all her windows. I think I saw a locksmith over there <br/>
this morning, too. She must have heard about the robbery and got <br/>
nervous!<br/>
<br/>
As for me, I'm losing sleep, and barely had enough appetite for my <br/>
second bottle of pale ale this morning. I didn't even go to any <br/>
karaoke bars last night! This whole thing is really getting me down!<br/>
<br/>
To top it all off, I've already received another ransom note from the <br/>
thief. After all those previous notes telling me to wait for <br/>
instructions, this one just tells me to figure it out for myself, and <br/>
includes more insults directed at Investigator Bacon...<br/>
<br/>
"You waNT Your PZ KuT BacK<br/>
WHaT DO i WaNT<br/>
i DO NoT WaNT Your<br/>
GreeN BacKs<br/>
You FiGure iT ouT<br/>
Your Pi is a<br/>
BareFooT HiLLBiLLY<br/>
reDNecK HicK<br/>
BuT WHo aM i"<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to contact the Investigator to tell him about this <br/>
new note, but he's not answering his cell phone... and I'd hate to <br/>
have to walk all the way into the kitchen, where he's sitting with <br/>
all those clues and documents spread out all over my table. Why do I <br/>
keep spending my money on this fool if he won't even answer his cell <br/>
phone when I call?<br/>
<br/>
What does this desperate criminal want from me? What do I need to do <br/>
to end this horrible nightmare? Isn't there anyone out there who can <br/>
help me? I guess I'll just take another shot of tequila and try <br/>
calling my investigator again. Maybe I'll shout at him this time and <br/>
tell him to pick up that stupid cell phone...<br/>
