made the clue pretty explicit, but its a little bit of a hassle to find <br/>
nonetheless.<br/>
Here's the clue:<br/>
<br/>
At the end of Beech St., park your car behind the apartment complex.<br/>
Walk around the yellow and red gate and down the sandy trail/road.<br/>
Go a couple hundred yards past a lake on your left.<br/>
When the trail hits a T, go right.<br/>
Between the 2nd and 3rd concrete round structures (on the left), look <br/>
for a small pile of bricks in the brush to the right side of the path.<br/>
Hidden under the bricks is the Floyd's Eye box. <br/>
<br/>
Wear bug spray, and if there has been a recent rain, wear boots. This <br/>
area looks like a scene out of Scooby Doo. Its really creepy.<br/>
