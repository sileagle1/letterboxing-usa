<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is an amazing hobby you can do by yourself or share with family and friends.  Letterboxing is an intriguing pastime combining artistic ability with delightful "treasure-hunts" in beautiful, scenic places that the whole family can enjoy. Participants seek out hidden letterboxes by following clues, and then record their discovery in their personal journal with the help of a rubber stamp that's part of the letterbox. In addition, letterboxers have their own personal stamps which they use to stamp into the letterbox's logbook.<br/>

            Our family/team is hosting an event this weekend, The Lass that Loved a Sailor, and inviting anyone with an interest in this fun and addictive hobby to join us.  It is a great way to spend a lovely spring weekend.  There are different events planned throughout the weekend, the first of which is a little reception and orientation - the perfect start if you are new to this area or this hobby.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This stamp will be available for a VERY LIMITED time: May 1, 2009 from 6 - 10 pm and then it will retire.<br/>
<br/>
To find the city:<br/>
<br/>
Grandma has applied to be a torch bearer for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Torch Relay. Our city is the second Celebration Community on the December 22, 2009 route (Day 54). We sure hope Grandma gets picked. We'd like to see her run . . . LOL.<br/>
<br/>
To find the street:<br/>
<br/>
Any of these fine gentlemen would enjoy living on this particular Drive: Adams Archibald, Alexander Campbell, FBT Carter, George-Etienne Cartier, Edward Barron Chandler, JC Chapais, James Cockburn, George Coles, Robert Dickey, Charles Fisher, Alexander Galt, John Hamilton Gray, TH Haviland, William Henry, WP Howland, John Johnson, Hector Langevin, AA Macdonald, John A Macdonald, Jonathan McCully, William McDougall, Thomas D'Arcy McGee, Peter Mitchell, Oliver Mowat, Edward Palmer, WH Pope, John William Ritchie, Ambrose Shea, William H Steeves, Sir Etienne-Pascal Tache, Samuel Tilley, Charles Tupper, Edward Whelan, or RD Wiolmot.<br/>
<br/>
To find the stamp:<br/>
<br/>
About halfway around this drive is a Road named after a river renowned because a Bard lived nearby. Turn right onto this little street and another right turn into the first driveway of Elgin Woods (apartments). Come around the back and keep your eyes wide open for 6 big bright flowers. There is a little stamp visiting there.  http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=112839 <br/>
