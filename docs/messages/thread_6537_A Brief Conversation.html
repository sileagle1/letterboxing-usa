<br/>
After arriving at Falcon Ridge on Saturday shortly after 10:00 AM, I headed <br/>
over to the Signature Sounds booth in the concessions area. Immediately next <br/>
door was the memorial booth to Dave, filled with candles, notes, photographs <br/>
and various mementos from well-wishers. Much to my great surprise, there was <br/>
Tracy by herself in the booth, busy cutting and arranging fresh flowers and <br/>
putting them in vases. I waited patiently for a few moments; when she turned <br/>
around, there was a smile of recognition (like many of you, I'd met her and <br/>
Dave at Falcon Ridge 2000 and chatted with them after concerts a few times <br/>
since), and we shared a long, comforting hug. After I expressed to her my <br/>
sorrow and sadness at Dave's passing, we just simply began to talk. About how <br/>
she was coping. About Dave's final few minutes of earthly existence. About <br/>
her presence at Falcon Ridge among so many of their fans and admirers.<br/>
<br/>
Much of my conversation with Tracy felt very personal and private to me, so I <br/>
do hope you will forgive my reluctance to relate many of its details here. <br/>
But allow me to share a couple of noteworthy insights: I described to Tracy <br/>
my inability to explain and talk about Dave's death to my co-workers, who, I <br/>
am certain, would be hard-pressed to understand how one could be so <br/>
profoundly saddened by the passing of a man who was neither a family member <br/>
nor a close personal friend. With some measure of both frustration and <br/>
defiance, Tracy acknowledged that many people just didn't "get" Dave Carter <br/>
or his genius. We also marveled at Dave's duality, how this poet who <br/>
seemingly occupied a completely different metaphysical plane than most of the <br/>
rest of us was, at the same time, such a very warm and easily approachable <br/>
man. And, while I don't recall exactly how the subject arose, Tracy told me <br/>
that Dave's vocal on the song "When I Go" sounds so hushed because, when he <br/>
was recording it, she was asleep in the bedroom next to the kitchen (where, <br/>
you may recall, the CD was recorded), and Dave didn't want to wake her up. I <br/>
just thought that behind-the-scene tidbit was quintessentially Dave!<br/>
<br/>
I was at Falcon Ridge for but one day this year. There were many wonderful <br/>
performers and performances throughout the day and well into the evening. <br/>
But, for me at least, my fondest memory of Falcon Ridge 2002 will be the few, <br/>
precious minutes I spent talking with Tracy Grammer. Experiencing her <br/>
kindness and grace in this most difficult time, I came away from our brief <br/>
conversation feeling uplifted and renewed, a little less sad. Thanks, Tracy.<br/>
