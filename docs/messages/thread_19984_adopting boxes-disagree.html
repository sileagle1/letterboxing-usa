We are also a part of the earth, and as long as the boxes remain intact (and<br/>

Is this view too romanticized? impractical?<br/>

What "real" harm would a letterbox pose out in the wild? (As opposed to,<br/>

containers, diapers, ect. Also, trash can be harmful to eco-systems and/or<br/>
"visible," and hense, disagreeable).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I adopted almost all of the letterboxes in North Carolina (at that <br/>
time), after trying unsuccessfully to contact their owners before the <br/>
LBNA change-over. Over half the boxes in the state would <br/>
have "disappeared" if I had not done that. Since then, several of the <br/>
owners have come forward and claimed their own boxes. (it seems some <br/>
people only letterbox while on vacation in the summer :-)<br/>
<br/>
I had at least two letterbox owners who emailed me and gave up their <br/>
boxes to me. They were no longer interested in letterboxing and were <br/>
not interested in maintaining their clues (or boxes) or receiving <br/>
updates on their boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I also have planted boxes in Iowa and New York State that I have <br/>
given up to other letterboxes to Maintain (since I just never get <br/>
back to those places to take care of the boxes)<br/>
<br/>
Of the boxes that I adopted, I note in the clues that I was not the <br/>
orignal placer of the letterbox, I also ask in the clues that if you <br/>
are the original placer, please contact me to take over your clues!  <br/>
I recieve notification when folks have found the boxes or if <br/>
something in the clues has changed. (Tree fell down from storm, <br/>
bridge washed out from flood, etc.) and I update the clues <br/>
accordingly.<br/>

There are a handful of boxes placed in our area by a<br/>
person that hasn't responded to multiple attempts to<br/>
contact them.  The boxes that are still there are nice<br/>
and in need of caretaking.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes that have gone missing could/should be<br/>
replaced--clues are great, parks are nice.  Letting<br/>
them die off would be a shame.  And needless to say,<br/>
people keep looking for them since no one is keeping<br/>
their status current on the website.<br/>
<br/>
In a way, it would be a nice way to honor the original<br/>
placer.  I'd adopt them, give the credit to the<br/>
placer, and keep true to the intent of their clues. <br/>
With someone looking after them, it would be more fun<br/>
for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Ditto, Devonpeter!   I hate the though of a viable box languishing with the <br/>
clues hidden in the letterbox basement.   When I adopt a box, I always put <br/>
something on the clues like, "If the original placer wants to take the box/clues <br/>
back, they are more than welcome," but in the meantime, other boxers are able <br/>
to find the box!<br/>
<br/>
Oceanwytch--   The boxes you'd be replacing are gone?   I guess if you try in <br/>
good faith to contact the placer, it'd be okay to re-use a hiding place, <br/>
though I'd write your own clues, if I were you.   And the safest course would be <br/>
(as someone already suggested) find your own spot in the same area, and do <br/>
clues from scratch.<br/>

I loved the spot so much that I really was in a dillema on whether to plant one of my own there or just resurrect theirs. I didn't want to step on toes, either way. So after getting advice from some other letterboxers, one who knew them, I have decided to re-post the clues, giving them credit for it, but I consider myself just "box-sitting" until they come back or retrieve the box. Not adopting, just "box-sitting". I felt better about it that way. Hopefully, if they ever return, they will appreciate that I took care of it in their absence.<br/>
