It is one of the many little towns along highway 141 between Sioux City and<br/>
Des Moines.  When you find it, take the road into the town that has the big<br/>
ear of corn.  At the second stop sign turn east onto the street named for a<br/>
tree.  As you follow that road it will curve to the north and you will come<br/>
to the fork in the road.  The right road crosses a bridge.  Just past the<br/>
bridge turn N. into the park.  You will soon arrive at a shelter house, park<br/>
between that and the wooden bridge.  The bike/hiking trail intersects here<br/>
in 3 directions.  Take the path that inclines and has a wall made from RR<br/>
ties.  As you meander along the path you will come to something that was put<br/>
there by the Lions.<br/>
You can find the letterbox about 10 paces from there.<br/>
