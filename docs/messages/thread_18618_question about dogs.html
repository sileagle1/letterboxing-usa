city-type who has dogs only in populated areas), but I find it <br/>
completely rude of the owner to have let the dogs get so far ahead <br/>
so that they were not able to call their dogs off/away from you.  I <br/>
can't imagaine my dogs being that far away from me! wow.  I guess <br/>
that since we cannot control the actions of others, a stern "off!" <br/>
along with a knee to the chest is definately the best response from <br/>
you. Dogs are just excited to see new people.  We have one very <br/>
friendly girl who just has to say hello to everyone at the dog <br/>
park...and it kills me when people allow her to jump on them...we <br/>
are really trying to train her not to do this.  The way we are doing <br/>
that at home is exactly what you did, and what was suggested to you.<br/>
Good luck :D<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have had the same problem several times while out on the trail -- <br/>
on trails where dogs are supposed to be leashed and often are not.  <br/>
I cannot tell you how many times the dog owners will say, "oh he <br/>
won't hurt you" as the big old dog is jumping up on me (and the very <br/>
expensive camera hanging around my neck), slobbering all over the <br/>
place.  In a few instances where I have mentioned that the dog <br/>
should be leashed, I have been told, "well we usually don't run into <br/>
people without dogs here" as if the trails were made specifically <br/>
for dog-walking and hikers are out of their element.  I even had one <br/>
woman call me a bitch because I disgustedly pushed her dog away with <br/>
my foot.<br/>
<br/>
There may be a degree of true in the statement that the dog knows if <br/>
you are a dog person or not, I know they can sense fear.  But in my <br/>
case -- I am not afraid of the dog, I like dogs, we have two dogs at <br/>
home.  I have no problem with my dogs jumping up on me and giving me <br/>
lickin' love -- I just don't appreciate it when it is unexpected and <br/>
the dog is not mine.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what the solution is short of dog owners being more <br/>
responsible.  And to be fair, this is not the case with every <br/>
dog/owner.  Unfortunately it is the few bad apples that ruin it for <br/>
everyone.<br/>

marked dogs must be leashed. I was walking down the trail when I <br/>
heard a barking dog running down the trail. I turned and saw a large <br/>
barking dog charging towards me with it's owner running much father <br/>
behind screaming at it to stop but the dog ignored the owner and <br/>
charged right at me and jumped on me barking away not in a friendly <br/>
greeting thats for sure. I was so startled I just froze and by then <br/>
the owner caught up with it and yanked it off me by the collar. The <br/>
dog was still trying to jump me as she was trying to put it's leash <br/>
on that she had been carrying in her hand. All she said was sorry I <br/>
didn't think anyone else was here today. Clearly a dog whose owner <br/>
has that little control over it should not be running off leash in a <br/>
public area. By the time I got my wits about me she was gone so I <br/>
never got to tell her what an idiot I thought she was. <br/>

I knee my own dog if she jumps on me when it is not invited.  It will take even the biggest dog by surprise and may just save that camera.  I have also been known to mention that there is a leash law ~ not that it ever made an impression on anyone, but I think it made me feel better!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dog owner/lover/former trainer here! This is a very sore issue for me, as <br/>
many of you know, so forgive my revisiting this.<br/>
<br/>
I've said it before and I'll say it again. It is absolutely unacceptable for <br/>
ANY dog owner to allow their dog to be so beyond their control that the animal <br/>
even gets within arms length of another person without their permission. <br/>
<br/>
When I ran dog-training classes, the very first thing I would teach in the <br/>
class is that your dog is considered to be your property, and that you are <br/>
responsible for making sure that your property causes no harm to anyone (just as <br/>
you are liable if someone gets hurt on your property). Forget jumping. Forget <br/>
chasing. Forget biting. All your dog as to do is be present and cause terror in <br/>
someone and you can have a lawsuit on your hands.<br/>
<br/>
We dog owners sometimes forget that the indulgences we allow our pets are not <br/>
always welcome or acceptable around others. Just because you might not care <br/>
if your dog jumps on you does not make it okay to allow them to do it to <br/>
someone else.<br/>
<br/>
As for what to do if it happens to you, I say that if you have some warning <br/>
(eg you see the dog from some distance away), shout to the owner to curb their <br/>
dog. If you have no warning, or if the owner is a bonehead and doesn't respond <br/>
to your shout, then telling the dog "NO!" or "OFF!" and knee-ing them firmly <br/>
in the chest is perfectly appropriate. You won't hurt the dog (but remember <br/>
that knee-ing them and KICKING them are two different things). If the dog owner <br/>
doesn't like it, TOO BAD! You did not ask to be assaulted. I usually ASK them <br/>
if they think that getting jumped on, scratched and muddied by a total <br/>
stranger's dog would be acceptable to THEM? I find that to be more effective than <br/>
telling them that their dog should be leashed. If they cared about that, they <br/>
would have leashed their dog. They are just are those amoral, entitled people <br/>
that we all meet from time to time. Yes, people! The rules DO apply to you.<br/>
<br/>
In this litigious world, they should be more worried about what you might do <br/>
to them (ie suing them) rather than worrying about cramping their dog's style. <br/>
(I have said that to people on the trail too)<br/>
<br/>
My dog is very aggressive toward other dogs, and I have to be very pro-active <br/>
about encounters with irresponsible dog owners. I shout to them at great <br/>
distance to curb their dog...often with the response of "oh, she won't hurt <br/>
you"...to which I respond "yes, but my dog will eat your dog." As you can imagine, <br/>
that often elicits a panicked response as they try to call off their dog and <br/>
avoid a fight and realize that they actually DON'T have the control they think <br/>
they do. The vast majority of dogs are not trained well enough to be called off <br/>
by voice alone...especially where another dog (...cat or squirrel) is <br/>
concerned.<br/>
<br/>
Tell the person, "I do not want your dog near me!" <br/>
<br/>
You have a right to hike without harassment or assault, or messed up clothes <br/>
or scratches...or slobber etc etc. and that means from dogs too! (LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm done. Sorry for going on.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck on the trail!<br/>

owner.  My son who is almost 2 is scared to death of dogs.  In the<br/>
situation described, even if I had picked him up, it would not have<br/>
mattered.  Leash or not, the owner has to have some control.  And, if<br/>
they don't the dog should be at home.<br/>

Just my 2 cents.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Re: question about dogs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe i'm naive to the ways of off-leashing it while hiking (i'm a <br/>
city-type who has dogs only in populated areas), but I find it <br/>
completely rude of the owner to have let the dogs get so far ahead <br/>
so that they were not able to call their dogs off/away from you.  I <br/>
can't imagaine my dogs being that far away from me! wow.  I guess <br/>
that since we cannot control the actions of others, a stern "off!" <br/>
along with a knee to the chest is definately the best response from <br/>
you. Dogs are just excited to see new people.  We have one very <br/>
friendly girl who just has to say hello to everyone at the dog <br/>
park...and it kills me when people allow her to jump on them...we <br/>
are really trying to train her not to do this.  The way we are doing <br/>
that at home is exactly what you did, and what was suggested to you.<br/>
Good luck :D<br/>

LOL!<br/>
Just make sure you send the pup home SOOOOOOOOOOO muddy that his owner never <br/>
wants him to get near one of those unpredictable human strangers again!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Most states have a leash law requiring dogs to be on a leash or the<br/>
owner can be fined. My friend lets her dog run all the time and about<br/>
a year ago received a fine from the DEP as she was in a state forest.<br/>
 Personally, I take my two boxers on every hike I go on and sign the<br/>
book as "runicwitch and dogs".  However, I tend to keep them both on a<br/>
leash as we often encounter other hikers, children and dogs.  The only<br/>
time I will let one of my dogs off is if we are in a very secluded<br/>
area as she stays fairly close and "holds" when I command (my other<br/>
boxer has a mind of her own, thinking is a human as well as I am!). <br/>
However, I often come across dogs running loose with the owner far<br/>
behind.  I usually grab them by the collar and hold them until the<br/>
owner comes and I let them know if there are a lot of people up ahead<br/>
or not and that they should leash their dog to protect themselves from<br/>
lawsuits...hahha!   Really, that's all they need is the dog to knock<br/>
down a child and have that child get hurt.  Not only that, but my dogs<br/>
are very protective and will growl at another dog.  They won't fight,<br/>
but they will try to look tough.  Watch out or they will lick you to<br/>
death if you meet us on the trail!!!<br/>
