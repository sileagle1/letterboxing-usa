Hi There,
</p><p>I noticed in the emails that someone found a hitchhiker that I placed
and no mention of this is under the name on the hitchhiker page. Should
the person submit the infomation somewhere else?  The below info is
what his message said. I found in the archives.

<b>Yesterday, 2-6-02, I found the Wandering Woodfairy hitchhiker. I</b>
<br/><b>               
found it at the new letterbox in Hampton Connecticut, Woodelves</b>
<br/><b>               
Letterbox. Both the Wandering Woodfairy Hitchhiker and the host</b>
<br/><b>               
box Woodelves letterbox were planted by jurneez and Vinnie the</b>
<br/><b>               
dog. I have only been to boxes in Windham and Tolland Counties</b>
<br/><b>               
and plan to plant the hitchhiker this weekend. So that is my clue</b>
<br/><b>               
to those looking for it. Now you just have over 110 boxes to chose</b>
<br/><b>               
from...... woodschuckstraub</b>
</p><p>summary: <b>"Wandering Woodfairy"</b> Hitcherhiker was placed in <b>"Woodelves"</b>,
H.E. Preston Sanctuary, Hampton, CT.
<br/>Straub found it on Feb. 8th. I don't know where he dposited it, but
I thought the info would show up under the "Wandering Woodfairy" on the
hitchhiker page.....
<br/>Am I wrong in my thinking?
<br/>Sincerely,
<br/>jurneez. and Vinnie the dog.</p></body></html>

your hitch hiker was probably in Woodelves, but when Bill posted <br/>
finding it I must've forgotten to jot it down so I could update the <br/>
website. I'll fix that right up!<br/>
<br/>
I think you (we all) can post hitch hiker news to either address, <br/>
here or to the webmasters. If you'd like to keep a little mystery in <br/>
the process, the webmasters address reaches a much smaller audience.<br/>

Hi again! We did start journaling the progress of hitch hikers <br/>
(you'll see a few down at the bottom of the hitch hiker page) but <br/>
it's become impossible to do that for all of 'em (there are 100+ out <br/>
there).<br/>
<br/>
Also, there are some among us who (rightfully, I think) feel that <br/>
spelling out all the details takes away from the aura of the game. <br/>
So, I'm not really tracking hitch hikers beyond getting their first <br/>
visit down accurately. Now, if folks would like to journal them on <br/>
their own websites, I'll be a frequent visitor! And I do really love <br/>
to read about their travels here on the list.<br/>
<br/>
Aside to Mohmers: sorry I haven't gotten your "journals" up yet as <br/>
promised!<br/>
<br/>
Jay in CT<br/>
your happy hitch hiker handler<br/>
