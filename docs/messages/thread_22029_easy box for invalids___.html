She loved solving clues and the terrain was flat. However she does use a walker for stability and has some emphazima. Her and I however live in Ct where the terrain is not as easy. We will be heading to Va. Beach over the summer any easy boxes near me or in the line of travel would be greatly appreciated. She really loved it and keeps hinting that she would like to go with the kids and I whenever we set out but the hikes here are too much for her. Thanks<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In CT there is a handicapp accessible one in Middlebury.  It's <br/>
called Hop Brook Lake Handicapped accessible.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, if you try atlas quest you can use a "trip planner" that give <br/>
you some  boxes [somewhat]on your route AND it has a picture key <br/>
that tell you info like if it's a driveby, child/pet friendly, hand <br/>
carved, handicapp accessible, compass needed, etc.  I like using <br/>
it,especially when I"m heading somewhere I"ve never been and I need <br/>
some quick, easy, child-friendly, drive-bys.<br/>
<br/>
I find it also let's you know what letterboxes will be near <br/>
(within ?? miles) of where you will be staying too.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thougth/suggestion.<br/>
