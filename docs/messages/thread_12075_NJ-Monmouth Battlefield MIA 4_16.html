the turtle one was found in good shape, and the second Millenium one was MIA. <br/>
We were all over that RR bridge but found nothing except that evidence that <br/>
kids/vandals hang out there, perhaps the box met its fate that way - or - we <br/>
were looking in the wrong place?? Thanks anyway for a great hike,<br/>
