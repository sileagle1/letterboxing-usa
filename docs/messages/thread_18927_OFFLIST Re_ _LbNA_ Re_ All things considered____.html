I read you little bit mentioning Nazi officer being queazy (sp?) and it really doesn't make light of it.<br/>

&gt; Please understand, I am not trying to make light of anything as horrendous as <br/>
&gt; the fact that millions upon millions of <br/>
&gt; innocent men, women and children were brutally murdered.  Nowhere did I make <br/>
&gt; light of it, nowhere did I laugh at it, <br/>
&gt; nothing and I take offense at the fact that you would twist my words around and <br/>
&gt; insinuate that I did so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is this type of word twisting and lies that make this hobby less than <br/>
&gt; desirable to the new folks that come along <br/>
&gt; and read these words.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The words that are referred to are in 'The Eye of the Storm, Vol 1.1', half way <br/>
&gt; down the page. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;I don't understand why you posted this to the list when you could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;have sent a private email.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Nor do I understand why you choose to respond to people in this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;unpleasant tone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Doesn't really reflect well on you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;B.V.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; That's what I love about this country, and this list. Just as Steve <br/>
&gt; &gt; has every right to make fun of the Nazi's murdering 6 million <br/>
&gt; &gt; innocent men, women, and children on his web site, so too does Phyto <br/>
&gt; &gt; to use what ever tone she pleases on this list. I guess it's all a <br/>
&gt; &gt; question of what you consider offensive, I for one find Steve's brand <br/>
&gt; &gt; of humor to be much more offensive than Phyto's "matter of fact" <br/>
&gt; &gt; tone. But that's just me.<br/>
