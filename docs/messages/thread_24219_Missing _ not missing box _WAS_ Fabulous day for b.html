&gt; &gt;I'm pretty darn sure I was in the correct spot when I checked on it -<br/>
&gt; &gt;there aren't a lot of hollow pines in this particular location. Not<br/>
&gt; &gt;that I'm complaining, mind you...I was sad to see this one go, as it<br/>
&gt; &gt;was a favorite carve, and getting it back, unexpectedly, is a real<br/>
&gt; &gt;treat. But still. Whaaa...? *scratches cranium* Lucy! You got<br/>
&gt; &gt;some 'splainin' to do!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cool!  I'd bet someone else had it "checked out" when you went to see <br/>
&gt; if it was there.  LOL<br/>

Ok, so after brunch I made the BF drive to the park. I had to replace <br/>
four boxes that I had pulled for maintenance, and of course I wanted to <br/>
see what was up with this one!<br/>
<br/>
It seems that the finder previous to the one who reported it missing <br/>
actually hid it BETTER than I had!  I had put it in a good-sized hollow <br/>
tree, off to one side and covered up.  When I checked on it, I didn't <br/>
find it there, and was not able to search around too much because there <br/>
were too many people around.  Today, it was cold (and Easter Sunday) so <br/>
there were very few folks about...sure enough, the box was there!  It <br/>
had been shoved WAY back in a small hollow inside the large hollow and <br/>
very well covered with leaves and bark.  So, YAY!  I updated the clue <br/>
page to reflect this slight adjustment in placement (for this urban <br/>
series, I am very specific about the hiding spot to enable seekers to <br/>
get in and out quickly and unobtrusively), and now I just want to <br/>
finish up on-line and work on a new stamp, or log, or something.  Hoppy <br/>
Easter, y'all!<br/>
