<br/>
Whetton Woods ( A Joshua's Trust preserve)     <br/>
Dog lane Storrs, Ct. <br/>
Tolland County<br/>
<br/>
Follow Rte 195 to Storrs, Uconn campus at the light at Store 24 and E.O.<br/>
Smith High School turn onto Dog lane    GO  SLOW<br/>
<br/>
It was a dog-gone funny time to go out letterboxing. We proceed down this<br/>
Dog Gone Dog lane over speed bumps, it is the twistiest Dog-Gone lane in<br/>
Mansfield .  We were indeed in need of some Dog-Gone good letterboxing<br/>
weather it had rained for a long time. We arrived at the Hope Lutheran<br/>
Church on that Dog-Gone Dog lane in Mansfield and parked at the rear. They<br/>
kindly allow the Joshua's folks to post their sign out front.  There are two<br/>
old metal posts and a brand new bridge  that is Dog-Gone nice to cross the<br/>
brook.  Now as of spring 2003 the trail here is  Dog-Gone new and only<br/>
marked with some Dog-Gone flagging tape in orange.  Follow the Dog-Gone tape<br/>
up a grade coming to a wall  with pink tape marking the Dog-Gone boundary to<br/>
other property. Now you have to follow the orange not the Dog-Gone Pink that<br/>
confuses the issue. Follow the wall and see the Dog-Gone campfire over the<br/>
property boundary a favorite teenage party spot.  The orange follows a<br/>
Dog-gone twisty path along  the wall passing a Dog-Gone huge  rock.  Down<br/>
the grade, where if your Dog is thirsty, a dog can drink here.  Cross here<br/>
and Dog-Gone it don't get your feet wet unless you are  a dog. Along a<br/>
different wall now to the corner when you come to the corner take a reading<br/>
of  90 degrees or so to a  woodpecker tree at 5-6 paces. Here up and in is a<br/>
Dog-Gone funny micro box . Please re hide in the Dog-Gone same place so<br/>
others can have this Dog-Gone experience for themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Now the Dog-Gone choice -  Go back the way you came or follow the twisty<br/>
orange marked path in a lollipop loop that comes back at the  campfire.  And<br/>
then back to the car. You have to watch the  path and double tape means a<br/>
turn. Some sections are still being cleared but it is a Dog-Gone nice walk<br/>
for a little over an hour. <br/>
