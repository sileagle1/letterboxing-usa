Yates County, Middlesex, NY<br/>
Terrain: A breeze - this one's basically a drive-by<br/>
Clues: Easy<br/>
Setting: Spooky!<br/>
<br/>
If you're a hiking enthusiast, you'll be disappointed by the short walk for <br/>
this one.  However, if you enjoy the unusual and strange, this is a box for <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Spook Hill--situated near a Native American burial ground overlooking <br/>
Canandaigua Lake--is so named because cars and bicycles will roll eerily <br/>
UPhill here.  For some time, theories abounded about this place, whether it <br/>
was haunted, a geomagnetic anomaly, or something more sinister.  In the <br/>
1970s, David Dutton, a scientist at the University of Rochester, undertook <br/>
an effort to find out exactly what it was.  His conclusion?  An illusion. <br/>
 I, however, happen to know a ghost lives here, and I'll tell you how to <br/>
find it.<br/>
