While I won't presume to answer for Jay, I certainly realize a few <br/>
problems with these two functions. If you would look at it from <br/>
a "Placers" perspective these two functions do not add anything <br/>
positive to the placer's letterbox. On the contrary they tend to <br/>
detract from the creation. Mystery is diminished if not eliminated. <br/>
Finders may not even try for a letterbox if there is many "attempts" <br/>
listed, and if the box hasn't been "found" in sometime the <br/>
prevailing wisdom might be that it is missing. The only thing that <br/>
really is effected is the search or lack of a search for <br/>
the "Finders".<br/>
There is a different mindset for the planter of a letterbox as <br/>
compared to the finder. The planter has created this stamp, logbook, <br/>
found a really neat spot that they want to share, taken the time to <br/>
plant the box, write clues (sometimes very cleverly) and then post <br/>
those clues.<br/>
The finder (not all) on the other hand wants to increase their F <br/>
count, checks to see if there is a history and when it was found <br/>
last. If it is a driveby and near another boxes so much the better. <br/>
Drives to the starting point, doesn't read the clues properly or <br/>
maybe not completely, looks for the box and if successful, stamps in <br/>
hurriedly and rushes off to the next letterbox. Doesn't even bother <br/>
to hike 50 more feet up the trail to the cool little waterfall that <br/>
was the reason in the first place for the letterbox. In their mind <br/>
that is okay because they think they had a successful weekend in <br/>
nabbing 30 letterboxes.<br/>
 Now many of us have done that very thing and many have come to a <br/>
point that those  multi-box weekends are less important. When it <br/>
comes right down to it I don't really give a damn about an F count, <br/>
what I care about is giving a gift of a neat spot, different <br/>
experience, a passable hand carved stamp, and some time you can <br/>
share with your family, friends or special person.<br/>
Some folks have a problem with boxes they deem "missing" or they <br/>
can't find easily. Not finding every letterbox is a part of <br/>
letterboxing. Sometimes life isn't always finding every last Easter <br/>
egg. Next time maybe you should think quality not quantity and not <br/>
even bother to check a letterbox history  and instead of cramming <br/>
several searches into you weekend go out for a single letterbox and <br/>
enjoy all of that "one" experience.<br/>

That's just what we did this afternoon.  Went looking for a relatively newly<br/>
planted box in Naperville.  Unfortunately, didn't find the box, but it was<br/>
one of the local parks in the area that I had never been to, and it was<br/>
quite a pretty little hike.  Very cute territory for such an urban area.  A<br/>
lot crammed into a relatively small amount of acreage.  Totally enjoyed<br/>
ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Then drove over to a nearby theater to see "The Weatherman" so I could drool<br/>
over Nicolas Cage a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Very easy-going enjoyable Sunday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Not finding every Easter egg isn't so bad.  What's bad is finding an Easter<br/>
egg in summer of 2005, seeing it's a tie-dyed egg, and realizing that the<br/>
last year that we tie-dyed an Easter egg was 1981.  Oops!<br/>
