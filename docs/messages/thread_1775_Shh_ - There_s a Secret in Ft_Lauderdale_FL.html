                    <html><body> At the south side of Ft.Lauderdale from I-95 get off at SR 84 and head west 
<br/>about 1/2 mile and watch closely for the Secret entrance on the north side of 
<br/>the road.
<br/>Park inside and visit the park office and get a map.After entering Â the park, 
<br/>you'll have to choose between the two paths. Take the one less traveled; you 
<br/>can visit the river afterwards. This is a very short walk.
<br/> Take the first right after getting on the trail to the first semi-circle of 
<br/>seats on your right. Go @ another 12 paces to the large strangler fig on the 
<br/>left.Because your mission is a secret, make certain you are alone and go 
<br/>around to the back of the tree and you'll find the box in crotch of the tree 
<br/>about 3' off of the ground.
<br/> Take the box over to the benches to complete the logs and again wait until 
<br/>you are alone before replacing the box.
<br/> Let me know how things are at SLOOPYTOM@AOL.COM
<br/> Thanks and enjoy,
<br/> Tom and Audrey Edwards</body></html>
