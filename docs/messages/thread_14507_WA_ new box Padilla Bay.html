Padilla Bay Nature Reserve is about half a mile up from Bay View State <br/>
Park, near Mount Vernon,<br/>
and is a great spot for bird and wildlife watching.<br/>
<br/>
  Padilla Bay<br/>
<br/>
  Padilla Bay is an estuary at the edge of the large delta of the Skagit <br/>
River.<br/>
A large colony of great blue herons lives there as well as many other <br/>
shorebirds such as dunlin and sandpipers. During the winter, the bay <br/>
contains an average of 50,000 ducks of 26 species, and many raptors <br/>
including bald eagles, peregrine falcons, merlins and snowy owls, so <br/>
bring your binoculars!<br/>
<br/>
To get to the Padilla Bay National Reserve:<br/>
Take Interstate 5 north from Seattle or south from Bellingham to exit <br/>
230, just north of Mount Vernon. Take Highway 20 west toward Anacortes <br/>
about 6 miles. Turn right at stop light onto Bay View-Edison Road. Drive <br/>
north about five miles, past Bay View State Park. The Breazeale <br/>
Interpretive Center will be on your right, 1/4 mile past the state park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 From the parking lot, follow the signs to the Upland trail. At the <br/>
bench, go straight ahead eastward. At the fork in the trail, keep left.<br/>
Keep going straight along the gravel path to the meadow. Stay on the <br/>
path through the meadow and back into the woods. At the fork in the <br/>
trail where the little wooden fence is, take the left spur to the <br/>
lookout. Approximately 28 steps along this trail, about 10 steps before <br/>
the lookout, there is a nurse stump on the right. Directly behind this <br/>
stump as you are facing it,  a little way back, is a tall tree, and <br/>
behind this tree is another stump. The letterbox is in this stump, <br/>
covered with bark.<br/>
