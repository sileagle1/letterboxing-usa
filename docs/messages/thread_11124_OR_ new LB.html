Chandler Pond at Abernathy Green<br/>
Oregon City, Clackamas County, Oregon<br/>

Directions: from 205, take #10 exit Park Place/Mollala (coming from the <br/>
north, follow the road as it curves around over the freeway; merge into the <br/>
right hand lane; coming from the south, turn right onto 213, and stay in that <br/>
lane).  Turn right at the light onto Washington.  Chandler Pond is just past <br/>
the Metro Waste Treatment plant on your right, but its parking area is <br/>
usually blocked, so instead turn left at the first light and park in the Home <br/>
Depot lot. Take the crosswalk across Washington.  Look for the wooden <br/>
Chandler Pond sign beyond the big wooden South Metro sign. <br/>
<br/>
“Chandler Pond at Abernathy Green” is kind of a pretentious name for such an <br/>
itsy little park.  A birder first told me about this place—depending on the <br/>
time of year, this can be a nice birding spot.  But the creature I’ve seen <br/>
here more often than any other is a nutria…or two…or three.  (What’s a <br/>
nutria?  A furry mammal that looks kinda like a big muskrat…but you’re going <br/>
to have to know a lot more about nutrias to find this letterbox!)  <br/>
<br/>
Start by deciding which direction to go on the trail:<br/>
<br/>
If nutrias are native to Oregon, go right on the trail; if they are not <br/>
native, go left.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the first bench you come to, and decide where to go next:  If nutrias <br/>
can swim, keep going; continue past the next bench and on to the one beyond <br/>
it.  If nutrias can’t swim, go to the very next bench.<br/>
<br/>
Nutrias are larger than muskrats, which is one way to tell them apart.  <br/>
Another way is by their tails.  If a nutria’s long tail is flattened <br/>
vertically, go to the bridge.  If a nutria’s long tail is round like a rat’s <br/>
tail, go to the next bench.<br/>
<br/>
Some biologists prefer to use the name “coypu” rather than “nutria.”   If <br/>
this is to avoid confusion because “nutria” is Spanish for otter, go to the <br/>
next bench.  If it is to avoid confusion because some people incorrectly <br/>
pronounce the word “nut-tree-ya” instead of the correct “noo-tree-ya,” go <br/>
past the next bench, and on to the one beyond it.<br/>
<br/>
If nutrias are taking over muskrat territory in the Willamette Valley, stay <br/>
at this bench.  If they co-exist peacefully with muskrats, go to the next <br/>
bench.<br/>
