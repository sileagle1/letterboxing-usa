                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>The lure of passing 100 F's was too great......so we went out and just beat the rain in CT today.
<br/>
<br/>My Favorite Stinky Thing: Great stamp, easy to find. We had a good time trying to guess what it was before we got there. None of us were right. &lt;g&gt; Just missed a HH that had been there the day before. Curse you Wanda and Pete!!!! &lt;big grin&gt;
<br/>
<br/>Northwest Park Little Creature Series: We were the first to find these four guys, since they were only planted yesterday, and as they are spread out over the park, you cover a lot of ground. On a positive note, if you've never been to Northwest Park before, you can also pick up the Slowpoke box on the way. 
<br/>
<br/>Cream of the Crop: This box is one of the smallest we've found yet, and the hiding place is really brave! It's practically right out in the open, yet it isn't. Hope this one lasts as long as it's neighbor the Cute Clucker has.
<br/>
<br/>We have passed the 100 mark! The Dragonfly, last of the Little Creatures series, put us at our goal. On to the next hundred, which probably won't take as long....we're planning our first trip to Manchester and it's nearly one hundred boxes very soon!
<br/>

I think you mean Mansfield.... I almost had a heart attack when you said that....I had NO idea that Manchester had so many letterboxes <grin!>!<br/>

Happy Letterboxing!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>How about we just call it Letterbox Central, Northeast?
