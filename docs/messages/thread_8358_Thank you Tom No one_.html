organizing this great event, and to Lady Alafair for her gorgeous <br/>
event book and stamp!  The pictures that I have viewed thus far are <br/>
terrific (though my daughter, when viewing the pictures, asked <br/>
me "Why was the Frugal Gourmet at the letterboxing event?" - a <br/>
chuckle to Yachtsman!) and certainly captured the spirit of the day!<br/>
<br/>
This was my very first letterboxing event, and a little rain was not <br/>
going to dissuade me from going!  I am very grateful to Mary RI and <br/>
Safari Man for providing me with both transportation and <br/>
accommodations so that I could revel with you all.  I finally <br/>
returned to my "winter" home today, and had a chance to count up the <br/>
event stamping (my hands are still a bit crimson).<br/>
<br/>
**Shock !!**<br/>
<br/>
2 Event Stamps<br/>
8 Found Stamps (guess I was lucky with a lot of magic words!)<br/>
42 eXchange Stamps - and there were folks there with whom I had <br/>
previously exchanged stamps, so their number is not even included!<br/>
<br/>
I loved the Boo! box!  Also snagged Nibiru and Canonicus.<br/>
<br/>
The funny story from the day:<br/>
<br/>
Since I live in Narragansett during the summer, I have been <br/>
corresponding, via email, with "Mad Mary".  We "knew" each other in <br/>
cyberspace, and traded emails back and forth, and I even went to find <br/>
her letterbox earlier in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
Now switch to Real Life.  In Real Life, I met this really great woman <br/>
who worked in a business near my summer home, and we spent quite a <br/>
bit of time chatting in her store.  I was sad to return to my winter <br/>
home (for many reasons) but one of the reasons why I was sad was <br/>
because I would miss this terrific woman with whom I had struck up a <br/>
friendship over the summer.<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward to the Mystery Gathering.  As I am busily stamping away, <br/>
I look up - and who is standing in front of me but my friend from the <br/>
store!  And lo and behold, I discover that she is - hang on - Mad <br/>
Mary!<br/>
<br/>
We both "knew" each other in cyberspace and in Real Life, and we had <br/>
never put the two together.  What a riot for us both!<br/>
<br/>
The endorphin rush from the day will keep me high for a week!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to, well, EVERYBODY !!!!<br/>
