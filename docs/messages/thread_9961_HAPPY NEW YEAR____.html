in my PJ's. Our trip yesterday to DC must have really taken it's toll <br/>
on me. Silver Fox says driving in DC is easy if you know the area! <br/>
HA! OK, every street runs N or S, E or W . Then they're one way, <br/>
always in the wrong direction and to add a little spice let's throw <br/>
in those ridiculous circles! NUTS!!!!! The good thing is I've learned <br/>
3 different ways to get to Virginia!<br/>
   Princess Turtle says we will have to go back to Portland, Maine. <br/>
We had that city figured out in a couple of hours! So looks like she <br/>
might be planning a less stressfull trip down east! After all we need <br/>
to plant at least 1 for legerdemaine as payback for his mighty fine <br/>
Smithsonian Box. Thanks for the fun!<br/>
