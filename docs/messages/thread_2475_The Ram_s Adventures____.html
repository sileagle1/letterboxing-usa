<div>Well, I have scouted out new locations for letterboxes... 
mostly accessible by boat (so sue me!) At any rate, I want to thank you all for 
the entertainment of reading all your posts for the past twenty minutes. After a 
refreshing overnight kayak trip, it was quite amusing. The cool thing is that I 
don't have to say anything, it's all been said. Now to deleting 125 emails!!! 
</div>
<div>Oh, and by the way, when Bulldog and I are out hunting for 
boxes, i'm usually the one reading the clue to him (luv ya Chip!). Thus his 
uncanny sense for sniffing out letterboxes. Although, I do share "the know" with 
him where at some point along the hunt (usually near the end) I will see a spot 
and know for sure that the box is there.</div>
