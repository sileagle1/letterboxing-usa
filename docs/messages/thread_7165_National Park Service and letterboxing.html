                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>I had a very productive and encouraging conversation with the folks that run the Springfield Armory in Springfield, MA, which is operated by the National Parks Service as a Historical Site. Though they hadn't heard of letterboxing, they really like the idea of placing one or possibly two boxes on their property, one inside the museum, and possibly one outside on the grounds. I took the time to explain to them what letterboxing is, how it works, and why I thought to ask them about placing boxes with them. 
<br/>
<br/>They want me to write up a little proposal for what I want to do, how it works, etc., so that they can take the idea to the superindentant of the Armory for approval. Is there anyone that has done anything similar to this before? I saw that there is a box in a library in Vermont, which is what gave me the idea for this in the first place. I'll keep you all posted as things progress.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thats very encouraging.  From reading the NPS rules and regulations, <br/>
they haven't actually come out and said absolutely no letterboxes <br/>
under any conditions...  they have simply taken the stance that all <br/>
letterboxes and geocaches must be pre-approved.  While this seems <br/>
like a hassle for us and we want to be able to just plant them at <br/>
will at these beautiful parks and landmarks, it is understandable <br/>
that they would want to be in the loop and be able to monitor what is <br/>
happening within the areas of their control and reponsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Question is, how difficult is the approval process?  Sounds like it <br/>
may vary by park and is quite dependent on the individual park <br/>
personnel.  And should you or anyone else succeed in placing a box on <br/>
NPS property, future opportunity will be based on that -- the <br/>
environmental impact, etc.  But it is a start and much better than a <br/>
flat out "no."<br/>

think that the best bet would be to go to the smaller National Parks <br/>
first...less levels of management.<br/>

<br/>
Jolly G-Man in DC and Thom in OR have also been quite successful in <br/>
cooperating with park supervisors.<br/>
<br/>
I've got a couple of boxes in a local park ("Hartman") and the <br/>
manager is so enamored of letterboxers that he placed <br/>
waterproof "what's this all about" sheets and clues in the front <br/>
kiosk. My trick: lots of trail maintanence volunteering.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
