Hi See Joy..<br/>
<br/>
It's nice to see you on the LbNA site..<br/>
<br/>
And out there boxing...<br/>
<br/>
Such a cool thing to see such birds on the wing so close to civilised<br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
In our wetter smaller locale we have to hike deep into wildes Scotland to<br/>
see Eagles..<br/>
<br/>
Even Dartmoor is too civilised for em..the letterboxers keep em away<br/>
perhaps !<br/>
<br/>
Live on, Box well !!! <g><br/>
