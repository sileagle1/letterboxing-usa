people in the area think who might steal or wreck a box?  And what<br/>
ways are there to protect your boxes from them without taking the<br/>
fun out of it for others?<br/>

recently, but I'll do that this weekend just to be sure.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how to avoid vandals.  Although I believe all of mine were<br/>
pretty well concealed (except for one that was really close to the trail) 2<br/>
are gone without a trace and the debris of one was found not too far from<br/>
its hiding place -- minus the stamp and book, though!  Bummer.  I'm not<br/>
going to whine any more about it, no matter how tempting that might be...<br/>
Just gotta get the new ones out.  I'm considering carving duplicate stamps<br/>
for #'s 1, 3 &amp; 4 (I stamped them in case they went away...) but haven't<br/>
done that yet.  If I put those out I won't hide them in the same places,<br/>
that's a cinch!<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>
