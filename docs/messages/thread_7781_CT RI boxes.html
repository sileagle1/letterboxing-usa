Also consider Midnight on the Moon,  Pt. Judith,  Vikings at Dawn, Ghost Town <br/>
at Sundown, Bristol Ferry Lighthouse, etc, etc.  There are so many great <br/>
boxes here. All within smelling distance of the sea, most right on the sea.<br/>

<br/>Just returned from our 8 days on the east coast. Only had so much time but went looking for 14 letterboxes and ended up with 9 which I'm happy with (NONE of the ones on Nantucket were there. . .bummer as I biked 25+ miles for them!!)
<br/>
<br/>Billions of Blistering. . . .was great although when we were there (Sept. 25) it was more like Billions of Fiesty Mosquitoes!! Also got Pt. Judith (my favorite stamp so far) May Basket, A Trip Through Town, Old Mansfield Cemetary and KJ's Best, where my husband finally jumped on the bandwagon and bought himself a stamp to enjoy the hunting even more with me. Pete and Wanda seemed to be one step ahead of us the whole time!! Fun. 
<br/>
<br/>Wish we hadn't had a plane to catch as I would have loved to take advantage of the Mecca that Mansfield/Coventry is!! Next trip!
