I'm wondering if you "planters" regularly beta test your<br/>
clues.<br/>
I suspect that there is likely a compulsive streak in many of us who <br/>
play this game. So, do you re-work your clues after you write them <br/>
and have someone test them for you?<br/>
I've found that after I've created a set of clues with what I<br/>
imagine <br/>
to be a good mix of clarity, ambiguity, challenge and reward, I then <br/>
have some doubts about all of those things. So I ask a friend or <br/>
relative to walk the clues.  Either I shadow them and watch them as <br/>
they walk the trail (or have them tell what they're thinking as<br/>
they <br/>
explore the clues) or I ask for feedback for trouble spots or things <br/>
that seem too easy (that I hadn't intended). I also tend to<br/>
wordsmith <br/>
a bit more at that point as well.<br/>
<br/>
I had a beta tester last weekend who discovered a small but serious <br/>
error in my clues that I was glad to know before I posted to the <br/>
site. It was a simple typo that had devastating consequences. <br/>
Obviously it was fixed.<br/>
<br/>
`Course I've only planted three boxes and am nervous about <br/>
unintentionally sending someone in the totally wrong direction! Maybe <br/>
lots of experience dulls that anxiety, eh?<br/>
<br/>
So, do you test your clues?<br/>

&gt; So, do you test your clues?<br/>
<br/>
I spend a ton of time vetting them to attempt to make sure they are as I <br/>
want them, and that there are no silly errors or things in the terrain I<br/>
missed, and that they are "fair" (by my definition) but would never work <br/>
with someone else to see how they worked them in a "beta test".<br/>
<br/>
I know I post alot of pretentious noise about semiotics and the role of<br/>
the reader, but that stuff is really interesting to me, and letterboxing<br/>
clues (at least the ones I like) really bring that theoretical stuff<br/>
to real life in the woods.  To get into a interpretation/modification<br/>
feedback situation with a beta tester wouldn't work for me ... once I <br/>
write a clue ... its each reader's' clue ... thus multiple clues ... could <br/>
one original clue lead to two different boxes?  Do any? :-)<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I'd say about 1 in 10 boxes I've hunted have had what I <br/>
would describe as "errors" (my definition being not what the author <br/>
intended).  North for south, right for left, bearings wrong by 100 or 180<br/>
degrees.  You get good at ignoring these sorts of things after you've<br/>
been doing this for a while.  I found one box with 6 errors ... tho <br/>
not surprisingly I was the first to find it after it had been out a<br/>
long time, and a couple of the errors resulted from terrain changes.<br/>
<br/>
I will say one of the most annoying things I encounter is vagueness near<br/>
the box.  V-shaped trees, hollow stumps, gnarled roots, rocks -- at <br/>
least in the mid-atlantic region, our woods have tons of these things<br/>
per square meter.  The V-shaped tree to the writer looks special because<br/>
he sees it, and is focusing his attention on it, or perhaps its a bit<br/>
bigger to him from his angle, but the reader sees 10 V-shaped trees <br/>
that all look the same and is prolly coming from a different angle.<br/>
Rather than stop to grid and search and kick up the forest, I usually<br/>
just press on, because I'm usually trail running and want to keep my<br/>
HR up.  This prolly doesn't annoy most folks, just my 2 cents :-) and<br/>
of course in my view the reader is always wrong, so I'm fine with it;<br/>
annoying prolly isn't the right word -- except I feel writers don't<br/>
make this mistake _intentionally_ -- that makes it annoying -- and I<br/>
know I use V-shaped trees also, but I'm pretty good about making sure<br/>
its the only V-shaped tree within 1000 miles, but, like everyone else,<br/>
am often wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
