                    <div class="plaintext-content">Whoa!  This "woe" thread is never gonna die out!  I guess there are countless answers to the itch, as well as countless tales to go along with it.  Our family's favorite answer, after having tried practically every product on the shelves, is "Domeboro" soaks.  It's not cheap, but this stuff dries up poison ivy much faster than anything mentioned so far and drying it up is really the only way to get rid of it fast.  It will relieve the itch for awhile too.  Whatever you put on in-between Domeboro soaks should be something that dries it out, not some rub-in cream.  Domeboro is non-prescription, but if you haven't seen it you may need help locating it as the boxes are small.  In the box are packets of powder that you mix w/ cold water.  Several times throughout the day, you saturate a cloth with the mixture and lay it on affected areas.  The box will probably tell you to use the mixture once, but there doesn't seem to be any problem with using it several times as long as you're dipping a clean cloth in it.  You may feel like you've done nothing for it, but give it a few doses and drying should start to be noticeable.  <br/>

It seems that one big factor with at least some people's allergic reaction is exposure to the roots or not.  I grew up in the woods, never had the itch, and suddenly got it BAD after pulling out a bunch of ivy by the roots, even though I thought I was well-protected just in case.  The next few times I had to pull some out, I got it less and less.  Now it seems not to bother me anymore, roots or plants, even though I've definitely had contact with both.  However, I know not to assume I won't get it again.   --lunaryakketyact<br/>
