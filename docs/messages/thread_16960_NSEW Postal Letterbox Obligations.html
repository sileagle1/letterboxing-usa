                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello to all who have signed up for these boxes. Your response has <br/>
been wonderful. I have about 60 people signed up for"A Little Bit of <br/>
Sunshine" box.<br/>
I would like to remind everyone that there are obligations to <br/>
receiving these boxes.You will need to be prepared to pay somewhere <br/>
between $1.50 and $3 to send these boxes on their way. Also It will <br/>
mean a trip to the post office, unless you have access to a postage <br/>
meter. We would ask that you please send the box on in a timely <br/>
manner as there are so many people waiting to receive these. There <br/>
have been problems in the past with some boxes that have been <br/>
received and just tucked away somewhere. So please be considerate of <br/>
the other people on the list. Also if you would be so kind as to post <br/>
a message either when you receive the box or send it on its way, the <br/>
creators would be most grateful. <br/>
With that said, if their is anyone who would like to cancel their <br/>
request you can do so at:<br/>
www.catbeadmischief.com/neswwinterboxextraveganza<br/>
be sure to contact all those you have signed up for.<br/>
So Off we go!!! " A Little Bit of Sunshine" will be on its way <br/>
tomorrow,11/24/03. The first 10 on the list are as follows:<br/>
1. California Bear<br/>
2. Busy Bee<br/>
3. Catbead 1<br/>
4. Doublesaj &amp; Old Blue<br/>
5. Peppermint Patti<br/>
6. Nautiliss<br/>
7. Neverenuff<br/>
8. Ewok<br/>
9. Dancin' Feet<br/>
10. Roberta Stillson<br/>
I'm anxious to see everyones Sig. stamps.<br/>

  For those that choose to send on the box through the US mail, you <br/>
might want to consider purchasing tracking confirmation for 45-55 <br/>
cents. If you go onto the usps.com website you can easily arrange to <br/>
have an email sent to you with delivery updates AND to other email <br/>
addresses you choose. For example, I could mail it and then ask that <br/>
delivery information be sent to the next person on the list and the <br/>
originator of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion,<br/>
