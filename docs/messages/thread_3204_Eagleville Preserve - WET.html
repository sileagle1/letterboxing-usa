off and sitting in a pool of water.  The stamp book was soaked, many <br/>
of the stamps have faded away because of the water. The Cock-A-Doodle-<br/>
Moo 4-H club sponsored this box, how do I notify them, or is this <br/>
message all I need to do?  It was so sad to come across a wet box. We <br/>
did re-pack it in a new zip-lock bag, but the damage has already been <br/>
done. <br/>
