                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I know that most letterboxes are placed in colder<br/>
climes.  I've got a few boxes ready to place in PA and<br/>
then the question came to mind about what to do with<br/>
them in the winter?  <br/>
<br/>
I assume most leave their boxes to winter over but I<br/>
have read about some who pull their boxes during the<br/>
late fall to early spring period.  What is the<br/>
consensus on this?  I realize when someone might have<br/>
hundreds of boxes out pulling them all would be a<br/>
great hardship.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything special you do to help your boxes<br/>
fare the harsh winter weather?  How do the ink<br/>
pads/pens fare?  Are there carving materials that<br/>
don't do well in the cold?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>
A.D.<br/>

lovely handmade log book, stamp and pad were in one<br/>
small container and that container was inside another<br/>
larger one. In areas where there is alot of moisture<br/>
from both rain and snow, plus bouts of sub-zero<br/>
weather, this method would seem to ensure that the<br/>
contents would stay dry even if one of the boxes<br/>
leaked or cracked. I have also seen boxes placed<br/>
inside larger heavy duty ziplocks. <br/>

<br/>
I once dug a Drew box out of a snowy den  at the seaside in N.H. The <br/>
winter  had provided  one foot of snow for hiking in . The rock cover <br/>
was solid frozen to the ground we kicked at it for a long time to <br/>
free the rock. There was the box! Ink, pad and stamp were fine even <br/>
with a thick coat of ice on lid - even the BIC pen wrote. I'll never <br/>
worry about wintering boxes again!  Leader of the Pack<br/>

P.S. I also prefer the winter hiking  less heat is better!<br/>
