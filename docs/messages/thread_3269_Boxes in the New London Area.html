<div>Hello all.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wow. I never knew that a fellow letterboxer was 
just a few minutes behind me on Saturday. I had a great day picking up most of 
the boxes in the area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Harley's Hex - Great Mysterious Place. Letterbox is 
fine.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Grey Rock - Both boxes are intact.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Barking Eagle - Coast Guard Academy. What a place. 
Though I did have to patiently wait an hour for a wedding photo session to 
conclude. Seem like the gazebo is a favorite place for wedding 
photos.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Connecticut Arboretum - Great Walk. Keeps you on 
your Compass reading toes. Box is fine.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Forts Griswold and Trumbel. Neat places for a 
history buff. Both boxes are there. Fort Tremble does have two flat rocks with a 
hole in them. Can be misleading at first. Elizabeth, please do try 
again.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Elaine and Jerry's Bluff. Found the spot, but could 
not find the box. I know it is probably there and will return in the winter when 
the vegetation is much more sparse. Did find the Two Labs &amp; A Box Mystery 
Location though.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All in all, a very good day.</div>
<div> </div>

<div>p42 f226 x4</div>
<div> </div>
<div>btw. YIMS [you inspire my spirit] and I are heading 
off to New Mexico. Hopefully we will find a few and quite likely plant a few 
too.</div>
