    I awoke to a glorious New England morning with a fresh coat of <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for sharing your photos of "Bowers Spring",<br/>
(and to for the plant). Looks like a lovely area<br/>
for boxing. Glad to see so many central Mass boxes<br/>
happening.  Its near my childhood home, and I do<br/>
get back from time to time! Now another box to<br/>
seek.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, does anybody know the status of "Town Pound",<br/>
in Shirley Center? Thanks''<br/>

Great pics. How do you cover your xc tracks once you<br/>
have found the letterbox? All I can think of is using<br/>
a pine bough  to sweep away the evidence, but that<br/>
would require skiing backwards, and I'm not that hot<br/>
skiing forward. Also, how did you get the Tom Turkey<br/>
stamp to stamp in different colors, or was it colored<br/>
in after it was stamped?<br/>

    I think it is easier for a Wolf to cover his tracks than it is <br/>
for a skier... The fact that I skied miles beyond what was required <br/>
for the box will surely help.  As for the area where I had to walk <br/>
around to locate the box, I fell back on the old "make a lot more <br/>
tracks so they can't tell WHERE you went"!<br/>
    I took the pic of Tom Turkey off his own logbook so it was done <br/>
by the creators.  Upon close inspection, it appeared they had painted <br/>
the colored inks on before stamping.  I didn't make a note of their <br/>
email address but if they are listening here they might be able to <br/>
let us know the technique.<br/>

JLR and I were the first ones to find Tom Turkey, and we noticed that the <br/>
creators had stamped him in lots of colors so we decided to continue. I <br/>
have some markers that are specifially for coloring on stamps.  You can <br/>
color right on the rubber--works just as well as any stamp pad.  I think <br/>
you should be able to find the markers at any crafty-type store.<br/>
Great stamp, btw!<br/>

Hi,<br/>
    I am the carver of Tom Turkey!  I made him different colors by using<br/>
brush markers.  You can take your time and color all the little parts in,<br/>
but it does dry quickly.  I just breathe some hot air onto it which seems to<br/>
dampen it just enough to create a nice print.  I'm glad he has found so many<br/>
rides and that you are enjoying him!<br/>

Thanks for the cool trick! I like the idea of several<br/>
diferent markers in the backpack as opposed to the ink<br/>
pad. Maybe I can give a little life to my snow angel<br/>
as well.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;     I am the carver of Tom Turkey!  I made him<br/>
&gt; different colors by using<br/>
&gt; brush markers.  You can take your time and color all<br/>
&gt; the little parts in,<br/>
&gt; but it does dry quickly.  I just breathe some hot<br/>
&gt; air onto it which seems to<br/>
&gt; dampen it just enough to create a nice print.  I'm<br/>
&gt; glad he has found so many<br/>
&gt; rides and that you are enjoying him!<br/>
