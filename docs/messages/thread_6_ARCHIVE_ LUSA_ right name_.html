Does anybody have a better acronym than LUSA for "Letterboxing USA"?<br/>
Somebody noticed that LUSA sounds like "LOSER!"...<br/>
LUSAH?--&gt;Loser? get it?<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions were:<br/>
USAL<br/>
LUS<br/>
USL<br/>
LetterUSA<br/>
LetterboxUSA<br/>
<br/>
I suppose shorter is better.<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ps.  On the other hand the name does not have to be "Letterboxing USA"<br/>
nor does USA part have to be in red, white and blue.  I was a little<br/>
worried when I did that that it might look smarmy.<br/>
Was it Mark Twain who said, "Patriotism is the last refuge of the<br/>
scoundrel?"<br/>
Anyway, welcome suggestions.<br/>

I agree, we certainly don't want to be LUSAhs! How about shortening USA to US? LBUS<br/>
LboxUS<br/>
USLtrbox<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the suggestions below, I like letterboxUSA. Its very classy. And descriptive. <br/>
Thanks for including me in your conversations. I feel like an outsider as I've never letterboxed, but look <br/>
forward to my first time!<br/>

I rather liked LUSA.   Only I heard it as "loose-a".  I was just about to have a T-shirt printed with "LUSA <br/>
woman" on the front.  :)<br/>

P.S.  Seriously, I don't mind LUSA at all.<br/>

I'm with giselle 100% on this one. The only other one that popped into my head was "LetUS" which is <br/>
worse by far, I think :-)<br/>

<br/>
and..<br/>
<br/>
we probably better get these kids involved...<br/>

<br/>
and finally, a slow-loader, but...<br/>

Subj:	 L-USA a name?<br/>

<br/>
To all Concerned:<br/>
<br/>
I asked a few days ago about the name LUSA:<br/>
Does anybody have a better acronym than LUSA for "Letterboxing USA"?<br/>
Somebody noticed that LUSA sounds like "LOSER!"...<br/>
LUSAH?--&gt;Loser? get it?<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of your responses:<br/>
<br/>
Some suggestions were:<br/>
USAL<br/>
LUS<br/>
USL<br/>
LetterUSA<br/>
LetterboxUSA<br/>
<br/>
Then there were some more:<br/>
LBUS<br/>
LboxUS<br/>
USLtrbox<br/>
<br/>
&lt;---And there were these COMMENTS---&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the suggestions below (for the title page I assume), I like<br/>
LetterboxUSA. Its very classy. And descriptive. <br/>
<br/>

&lt;---End of COMMENTS---&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;---My RESPONSE---&gt;<br/>
<br/>
After reading your comments here is what I suggest:<br/>
Change the LUSA acronym to L-USA<br/>
By the way, this would mainly be used, I thought,<br/>
as a prefix for e-mail titles so that people <br/>
can see at-a-glance what the e-mail is concerning.<br/>
For examples: <br/>
L-USA - New Vermont Clues<br/>
or L USA: New Clues<br/>
etc...<br/>
This is not a significant change but it won't sound<br/>
at all like LUSAH or Loser. <br/>
But I think t-shirts could read "LUSA Woman", "L-USA Man",<br/>
"L USA Butthead", "What the hell is a LUSA?", etc...<br/>
<br/>
And I suggest changing the title page to Letterbox USA,<br/>
again there is little difference between Letterboxing USA<br/>
&amp; Letterbox USA.  But I agree with Linda that this is<br/>
more classy, elegant, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So if I don't here anything, I'll be doing that<br/>
sometime in the next week or so.  These aren't rules,<br/>
by the way: its just trying to have fun with it.<br/>

Well, just goes to show what I've always said,  There's a lot of "lusa's" out there in this ol' world!!<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind the LUSA acronym (although L-USA is probably better).  To tell the truth, I kinda liked the <br/>
"LetUS" one... not like "lettuce",  but like... the Dartmoorians do it, so Let US!!!<br/>
