copule of weeks, which is NOT offen (ugh!!). <br/>
Here is a short update....<br/>
Connecticut<br/>
Captain's Walk , Olde Mystick Village boxes are great. Thanks for <br/>
the captain's walk it was beautiful. Even got to see some artist <br/>
painting along the road side.<br/>
Barking Up The Right Tree - Our first "first finder" box! If your <br/>
passing thru Ct. check this one out.<br/>
New Jersey<br/>
Round Valley great walk box is in good shape. Is this box a geocache <br/>
also? It had many little trinkets in the box along with the stamp <br/>
and notepad.<br/>
Edward Stratemeyer used ghostwriter's and this box is now a ghost - <br/>
MIA - ( we looked high in every direction!)<br/>
Turkey Mountain what a great hike! The boxes were in good condition <br/>
but have not seen a vistor in a year.  (We started this hike and 1/2 <br/>
way thru a thunderstorm and downpour got us! But our log book was <br/>
spared!!) Did Pyramid Mountain a while back that too is a great <br/>
hike! Thanks Wingfoot!!<br/>
We have the clues for "Huts" worked out and are planning on heading <br/>
there and to the Great Swamp to look for Lord Sterling when the rain <br/>
lets up.<br/>
<br/>
All hiking in old socks,<br/>

He was up in a knot/hole in a tree - what a shame - my first LB to go missing.  Maybe <br/>
I invaded a squirrel's home and the box was evicted.<br/>

I was at the Turkey Mountain boxes on July 14, 2002, so maybe it was me?<br/>
