&gt;I realize it's not wise to generalize (how's that for poetry) but I <br/>
&gt;believe that there is a different mind set for Geocachers and LBers. (I am <br/>
&gt;probably starting a thread that will get a life of it's own). You know my <br/>
&gt;poor experiences with a couple of geo guys , and the further we can <br/>
&gt;separate ourselves from the other hobby the better. That's not to say <br/>
&gt;there can be combinations if one wants it as" there are no rules". It is <br/>
&gt;just that I believe letterboxing should stand on it's own. Don<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree that letterboxers see geocachers as a breed apart (even if the <br/>
reverse isn't necessarily true). But to the "outside" world, we're all <br/>
lumped together. I'd guess that most parks officials wouldn't differentiate <br/>
at all between letterboxing and geocaching. But since there are 10 <br/>
geocaches for every 1 letterbox in the US, the 'cachers are going to draw <br/>
first fire in most any debate over the allowable use of public spaces.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that it means that letterboxers need to take extra care to be <br/>
super-conscientious eco-citizens. The recent discussions on "leave no <br/>
trace" ethics are a good case in point. I prefer to think of letterboxing <br/>
as a "low impact" environmental activity, since it's *possible* for us all <br/>
to enjoy letterboxing and not have a detrimental effect on natural areas.<br/>
<br/>
We do, of course, need to be very aware of not intruding on sensitive <br/>
ecosystems, as a first step. And if we each go the extra mile, for instance <br/>
to pick up trash on our letterbox excursions, we might even have a <br/>
net-beneficial effect in the parks where we enjoy letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
The geocachers have a saying, "cache in, trash out," that's their call to <br/>
action. Many letterboxers already make it a habit to carry a plastic bag in <br/>
order to pick up trash they find while they're out on the trail. Perhaps <br/>
letterboxers should follow this example and adopt the motto, "Box in, bag <br/>
out." If we each collected a bag of trash during every letterboxing trip, <br/>
we'd could easily be collectively responsible for removing several tons of <br/>
garbage from parks and wild areas each year.<br/>
<br/>
As an added benefit, if we put these principles at the forefront *and then <br/>
followed them*, I bet we could gain some additional leverage in dealing <br/>
with suspicious parks managers.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We do both - I don't think that there is much difference between the <br/>
sports (?) Both "do" the same thing gets you off your toosh and <br/>
outside. Both are goal oriented - a stamp in your log or something <br/>
to pass on to the next cache - the only noticable difference I see - <br/>
geocashing appeals more to my sons (and I believe males like using <br/>
electronic "stuff" more) where letterboxing seems to be mostly <br/>
women - please do not take offence or let me know your a woman who <br/>
likes geocaching or a man who prefers letterboxing. But if you've <br/>
ever visited the geocaching site you would see what I mean. I think <br/>
seeing a young man or group of them wandering around in a park might <br/>
be something for rangers and policemen to give pause to. We have <br/>
been stopped twice - once the saw the GPS they kinda laughed and <br/>
told us to remember that the park closed at dusk....  To my ranger <br/>
friends who at one point thought it was not a great idea do agree <br/>
the person peeing in the woods do more harm that those looking for <br/>
a "box" Because there are so many geocaching boxes they don't get <br/>
hit on as many timed a those in the open - not to mention those <br/>
little machines can be pretty pricey so that does keep some from <br/>
participating. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly - having been intervied several times I can tell you that <br/>
when there is no story the press can always find a way to make it <br/>
more intresting - notice they gave no ones name or postion in the <br/>
park they were talking about? Were they trying to make a story or <br/>
hoping to get the park systems shorts in a knot so that there was a <br/>
story?? Remember wag the dog?<br/>

Wouldn't that be great! I really agree that we need to stress the <br/>
eco-mindedness of our hobby. That is why I tried to stress it so furiously to the <br/>
newspaper reporter that did the story on us. The more we publicize THAT aspect of the <br/>
hobby, the better we should fare in the eyes of the public and hopefully to <br/>
park employees.<br/>

Who all does this?  I always take my kids with me (sigh! someday I can do <br/>
something alone!) and we take a garbage bag and gardening gloves with us <br/>
everywhere and always pick up litter.  I think it's an excellent thing to add to the <br/>
fun.  <br/>

No offense taken. I'm more into letterboxing than my wife. Neither <br/>
of us geocache. Several of the LBNA pioneers are male. Possibly a <br/>
majority, I'm not sure of the actual count. <br/>

Well that was a generalization - but in the early days of anything <br/>
it was male dominated. I believe that letterboxing used to require <br/>
the use and knowledge of a compass - and that alot of boxes had <br/>
cryptic clues - all things males are (not bashing here) are <br/>
intrigued by.<br/>
