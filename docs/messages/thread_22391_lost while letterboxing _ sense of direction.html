If you don't use a gps unit then do you always use<br/>
topo maps? Or do you have really good<br/>
compass/navigation skills. Do you have an innate sense<br/>
of direction? <br/>
<br/>
The last one. Some are born with it but I found you can cultivate your sense <br/>
of direction. Some time, when you'd near the coast, close your eyes and just <br/>
feel the pull of the water. When you're farther away, practice this again. You <br/>
really can, if you listen to your inner "magnet", begin to feel what migrating <br/>
birds, whales and other animals must feel. One day, you'll be somewhere and <br/>
just "know" which way is north. Of course, getting your bearings from the sun <br/>
is a good clue too! (rises in the east, sets in the west)<br/>
