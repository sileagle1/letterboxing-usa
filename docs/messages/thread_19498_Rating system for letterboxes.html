You can do that--people count all sorts of things unrelated to the <br/>
standard P and Fs--but I doubt the system will pick up a large <br/>
following.  Too unnecessary and too complicated.<br/>

It definitely would be nice if some of the clues mention how long it takes to find the box.<br/>
<br/>
Some already do but many don't.  It wouldn't keep me from doing the longer ones, I would just plan better for when to do them.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, we found one in Indiana that said go to the "duck pond."  Up until then all the clues had been a few steps apart and at the park it didn't tell how long to the duck pond.  It turned out to be a 2.5 mile loop.  It was well paved and easy walking, however we hadn't planned to spend that long. (However, the stamp made it well worth the walk!)<br/>
<br/>
It's just that we might have planned that for when we had more time.  There are days when you want to do other things as well and there are days when you have all day for nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Does this make sense?<br/>
