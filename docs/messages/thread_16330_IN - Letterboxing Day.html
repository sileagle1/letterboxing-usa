boxes are few and far between in central Indiana, we decided to <br/>
venture down to south east Indiana to hunt down a few of ScoutDog's <br/>
and Franzola's boxes.  We found all 7 of the ones that we looked <br/>
for!  Below is a box by box report:<br/>
<br/>
Tow Path Park: Good condition!<br/>
Old Metamora Mill: The log book is quite wet.<br/>
Old Post Office: It took us awhile to hunt this one down, but we <br/>
finally found it and it is in good condition.<br/>
Hilltop Overlook: Good condition!<br/>
snakes ... : Good condition and we were first finders!<br/>
Historic Little Cedar Grove Baptist Church: Good condition!<br/>
Cedar Grove Church: Good condition!<br/>
<br/>
That brings our P count to a whopping 9.  Too bad we missed the turn <br/>
for the Waterfall box or we could have made it a nice round 10.<br/>
<br/>
We are looking forward to our big trip in 2 weeks to John Bryan <br/>
State Park.  30 boxes in one park is overwhelming!  That is more <br/>
than are in the entire state of Indiana!<br/>
