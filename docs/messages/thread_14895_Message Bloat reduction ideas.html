                    <div class="plaintext-content">Strongly agree, as long as there's a group for "generic" discussion such as whether to use the term SitRep or something else.  Some groups that I've been in have had a special list for newbie or other questions; this is the list that posted the FAQ weekly or monthly.  One or two experienced folks would moderate/respond; newbies were automatically subscribed until they could figure out how to unsub themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Groups might be East Coast (or Northeast/Southeast), West Coast, Midwest, South(?), Pacific Northwest, general, newbie-Qs/QsandAs.  Suppose there should be one for outliers too - Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico - and so forth.  Are there any boxes on military bases?  Should there be a group for those?  If that's too much fractionalization, how about keeping letterbox-usa for general discussion and adding a QandA group (newbie or otherwise)?  Or keep this group general, add a QandA group, and create a letterbox-usa-sitrep group ONLY for SitReps?  Or keep letterbox-usa for sitreps, add a QandA group, and create a letterbox-usa-talk group for discussion of new or off-topic ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Hope this gets the group moving towards a consensus.<br/>
