<h2>FFA Creed</h2>
<p>Planted at; Falls of the Ohio State Park, 
Jeffersonville, Indiana on 11/2/02 plan time to explore the fossil beds. park is 
free,<span class="588443500-09112002"> </span>visitor center worth the ticket 
price!</p>
<p>The FFA Creed</p>
<p>I believe in the future of agriculture with a faith 
born not of words but of deeds-achievements won by the present and past 
generations of agriculturalists; in the promise of better days through better 
ways, even as the better things we now enjoy have come to us through the 
struggles of former years.</p>
<p>I believe that to live and work on a good farm or to 
be engaged in other agricultural pursuits is pleasant as well as challenging; 
for I know the joys and discomforts of agricultural life and hold an inborn 
fondness for those associations which, even in hours of discouragement I can not 
deny.</p>
<p>I believe in leadership from ourselves and respect 
from others. I believe in my own ability to work efficiently and think clearly 
with such knowledge and skill as I can secure and in the ability of progressive 
agriculturalists to serve our own and the public interest in producing and 
marketing the product of our toil.</p>
<p>I believe in less dependence on begging and more 
power in bargaining; in the life abundant and enough honest wealth to help make 
it so-for others as well as myself; in less need for charity and more of it when 
needed; in being happy myself and playing square with those whose happiness 
depends upon me.</p>
<p>I believe that American agriculture can and will hold 
true to the best traditions of our national life and that I can exert an 
influence in my home and community which will stand solid for my part in that 
inspiring task.</p>
<p>The Creed was written by E.M. Tiffany. It was adopted 
at the third National Convention of the FFA and revised at the 38th and 63rd 
conventions to reflect changes in FFA members and the agricultural 
industry.</p>
<p>2002 was the 75th Convention. Through these words 
guidance is given to the more than 450,000 members of the FFA. 51,900 were in 
attendance at Louisville, Kentucky. To find the box that honors the Creed park 
behind the interpretive center. Take the gravel path down toward the river at 
the fork take a bearing of 320 degrees follow that, pass a tree with haunted 
roots on your right. take 17 steps ,then take a bearing of 60 degrees walk 28 
paces (count only left foot) there should be a large tree to your right. Take a 
bearing of 20 degrees and walk out 15 paces that direction. Look for a hollow 
tree. The box is UP inside the tree. (Put it in and take it out in a vertical 
position. Turning it horizontal keeps it in place. The stick in the hollow is 
Just in case! Stamp secretly, reseal tightly. carefully place back up inside the 
tree. Have Fun Be Safe enjoy the fossils!</p>
