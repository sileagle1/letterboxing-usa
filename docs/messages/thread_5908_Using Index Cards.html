                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't use a journal or book to record my finds. I use index cards. <br/>
I stamp the unruled side and write other information on the ruled <br/>
side. The index cards are then put into postcard collector pages <br/>
which holds 4 index cards. Two pocket pages are also available if <br/>
needed. I have a section with my finds, a section with a copy of the <br/>
stamps from my planted boxes along with the instructions to find my <br/>
boxes. Another section is index cards of stamps I got for exchanges. <br/>
My last section holds postcards that were sent to me from my <br/>
letterboxes or notes left by other letterboxers (I like to make my <br/>
own postcards for each of my letterboxes). This is all in a 3 ringed <br/>
binder. I find that cards are easy to carry and keep clean in the <br/>
woods. They only make 1 trip in the field and have less chance for <br/>
damage. They can be put in perfect order any way you want them. <br/>
   For the boxes that I plant, I prefer to use Oxford white 3"x5" <br/>
ruled index cards, 50 on a spiral ring (like a notebook). I start it <br/>
backwards so the first 50 stamps are on the unruled side. I find that <br/>
they are stronger and a drop of water hitting a card does not do any <br/>
damage to the card below it. Lighter paper and a few drops of water <br/>
can be a disaster. That's just my opinion about index cards. Not <br/>
looking for any converts, just stating my views and Molly don't care <br/>
at all what we use as long as we are in the woods......Chuck &amp; Molly<br/>
