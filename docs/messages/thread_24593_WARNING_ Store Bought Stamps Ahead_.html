stamps, just not my thing. I believe this same discussion came up<br/>
years ago, I planted my first box in 2000 and I posted a similar<br/>
warning. Anyway, Happy Hunting!<br/>

The work put into the clues and description of the bike trails are some of the most extensive I have read.  Thanks for the meticulous work  and thought put into the location, hiding places, and clues.  I don't mind your store bought stamps!<br/>

Hey Now, Bill &amp; Craig!<br/>
<br/>
I've noticed that pattern but it won't keep me from finding more of <br/>
your 'boxes.  Thanx for bringing me to these old rail roads, they make <br/>
for some nice hiking and biking, and the occasional picnic stop.<br/>
