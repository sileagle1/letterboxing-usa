<p><b><span>Andrew 
woke early on the morning of his birthday. He quickly put on his sneakers, 
leaving them untied of course [today he was 10 after all], raced downstairs, out 
the back door, down the street, across Quinaquisset [after looking both ways], 
and into his favorite woods.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><b><span> <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>He raced 
up to the signboard at the end of the parking lot. There it was, just as mom and 
dad promised, a great big birthday card. Andrew opened the card and read what 
was inside.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<h3><b><span><em>Happy 
Birthday Drew<o:p></o:p></em></span></b></h3>
<p><b><span><em> <o:p></o:p></em></span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Your

<p><b><span>Andrew 
ran down the path towards the river. When he got to the bench, he stopped to 
watch a giant woodpecker poking around an old tree looking for insects. Then he 
took off down the path to the left. When he reached the first intersection he 
swerved to the right and ran along the faint trail. Uphill and downhill jumping 
over lots of fallen trees, back to the main path. Turning right he raced along, 
over the U shaped tree, up to the next intersection.<span>  </span>He took the path to the right and ran 
along the riverbank until once again he returned to the main path. Here he 
turned right and ran along the path. Soon Andrew reached the L R Trail. He knew 
that his favorite tree was just up this trail. At last, Andrew was at the base 
of his favorite tree, one of the largest pines in the forest, and the only one 
whose branch grew over the trail before shooting straight up. On the east side 
of this tree is a large burl. Standing in front of the tree facing the burl, 
Andrew spied several fallen trees and branches in the woods off to the left 
[approximate bearing is 220 degrees]. He quickly hopped over to these trees and 
discovered a blue tupperware container hidden among them. He opened the lid, and 
there inside was an invitation to his birthday party. <i>{Andrews Birthday 
Party} </i>Under the invitation was a new clue.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><b><span> <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Your 
birthday present is hidden by the holly grove.<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span> <o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>
<p><b><span>Andrew 
bolted down the L R trail, through Marsters Grove, to the end of the trail. Then 
he continued along the Chickadee Trail. He ran straight through the next trail 
intersection, continuing along the C T. Soon he reached the South Parking Area. 
Here he turned and followed the P B Trail. At the intersection with the W L 
Trail, Andrew bushwhacked along the faint trail that appears to be a 
continuation of the P B Trail. He soon reached a pine grove, and jumped for joy, 
for he knew that the holly grove was located at the end of the pine grove. 
Standing under the holly trees, looking toward the southwest, Andrew spied a 
fallen log with a small man made lean to on the southwest side. Brushing away 
the pine needles, Andrew found his birthday present, two tickets to a Boston Red 
Sox baseball game. {<i>Take Me Out To The Ball 
Game}.</i><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><b><span> <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Find 
your way back to the W L Trail, turn right and follow the trail to the 
intersection with the L R trail. You can then back track to the North Parking 
Lot.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
