                    <div class="plaintext-content">Several people have stated over the last few months that the only<br/>
rule in letterboxing is that there are no rules.  This is a bit<br/>
of a misnomer.  Michael Gladney, Trevor Dallas, Adrian and other<br/>
contacts from Dartmoor have stressed the need to observe certain<br/>
conventions in letterboxing for the sake of cohesion.  In general,<br/>
the idea is to describe the means to locate a letterbox inside<br/>
which you find a stamp.  Most everyone I talked to between March<br/>
and April of 1998 (when we began Letterboxing USA) suggested that<br/>
we be descript, and use compass bearings when possible.  Abbreviations<br/>
are acceptable.  Man-made objects are generally not a place to hide<br/>
a letterbox although I can see exceptions to that - for instance,<br/>
you have found an ideal location.  You either have to plug the<br/>
letterbox (which entails digging a hole) or you can hide it behind<br/>
a lamp post.  You don't have a shovel with you so you opt to hide<br/>
it behind the lamp post.  But again, the rule is to use natural<br/>
objects as much as possible and to avoid man-made objects.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to Trevor Dallas' rules/conventions which are by<br/>
agreement acceptable to he and his mates in Dartmoor.<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/trevlet.htm<br/>
He sent this letter to me in April 1998.  Its good for rules<br/>
about abbreviations and clues in particular.<br/>
<br/>
We have also established some of our own rules because of the<br/>
nature of using a web site to publish information.  Do not hide<br/>
a letterbox in a location where it may cause harm to a letterbox<br/>
hunter.  If you hide it under a rock try to choose one that does<br/>
not have sharp edges, esp. if it is particularly heavy or hard<br/>
to remove.  Do not put a letterbox next to a cliff, under a<br/>
waterfall, etc.  Make note of the waiver that we use on the site.<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/waiver.htm<br/>
Or write your own waiver and include it with your clues.  That's<br/>
what Randy Hall and a few others have been doing.<br/>
<br/>
Try to avoid ambiguity when using directions or compass bearings.<br/>
Sometimes several places can be described by one set of bearings.<br/>
Ambiguity will leave people standing in the area scratching their<br/>
heads because there is no way to understand what it is you are<br/>
trying to describe.  You can have non-ambiguous clues that are<br/>
nonetheless difficult.  Look at Randy's Ohio letterbox clues:<br/>
http://www.mapsurfer.com/boxes/box3.html<br/>
No doubt, once you are in the vacinity you will be able to clearly<br/>
resolve even these "mystical" sounding clues.  <br/>
Here's another one that may be difficult but is not ambiguous:<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/knobsecr.htm<br/>
Once you understand that you are following the couple in the story<br/>
to the letterbox it will beocme clear where to go.<br/>
But what I'm talking about with ambiguity is like this: "Stand where<br/>
the oak tree is at a bearing of 310 degrees."  Even if there was<br/>
only one oak tree (which would be doubtful because where there is<br/>
one there are usually more), but even if there was just one there<br/>
would be many places where you could stand that would put it at a<br/>
bearing of 310 degrees.  That's no fun for the hunter who gets to<br/>
a place that fits that description perfectly and finds that there is<br/>
no letterbox.  The person would probably presume it is missing and<br/>
report it as such.  So try to be clear whether your clues are<br/>
difficult/tricky or not.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some other basic rules for the protection of your box:<br/>
Try to hide the letterbox well.  If its easy for someone to find<br/>
it accidentally they may just walk away with it or toss it not<br/>
knowing what it is.  I believe this happened with at least 3<br/>
of our letterboxes already.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to use containers which may have<br/>
contained food.  A while back there were several testimonials<br/>
about animals using their keen sense of smell to find or unearth<br/>
old food storage containers.  Animals are very good at this.<br/>
If they get your letterbox, tear it apart and strew the contents<br/>
all over the countryside that's bad for us.<br/>
<br/>
As for locating your box and writing clues I would say there are<br/>
definitely two rules:  1) Make it possible to find it.  You may not<br/>
be around forever, and we don't want the countryside littered with<br/>
unfindable letterboxes.  2) Make it hard enough so there is at least<br/>
some challenge involved in finding it.  Children and adults want<br/>
there to be a little gaming involved. That's the whole point of it.<br/>
<br/>
Here's another rule:<br/>
The letterbox itself should have a stamp in it.  We once talked <br/>
about a "cyberbox" - a letterbox without a stamp but rather a code<br/>
that you could use to go back to the web and get the stamp image.<br/>
But I've yet to find one person who believes that would be a<br/>
legitimate letterbox.  There seems to be universal agreement that<br/>
a letterbox must either have a stamp in it or it must point to an<br/>
actual stamp elsewhere (as does a letterbook).  We could always<br/>
change this I suppose if a particular area is rampant with <br/>
vandalism and we can find no other way to guard against that.  But,<br/>
for now, the rule is there must be a stamp in the box.<br/>
<br/>
Another rule is to respect nature and other people's property.<br/>
This one is very important because to not do so may jeopardize<br/>
the hobby, give us a bad name, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I just wanted to clarify things a bit.  There are rules/things<br/>
to be observed without which the hobby may become (the way it<br/>
develops here in the U.S.) messy, not any fun, cause for lawsuits or<br/>
cause for letterboxes that are prone to loss and/or damage.  Please<br/>
observe these rules and point out others if you think of any.  We do<br/>
want the hobby to have a measure of predictability and cohesion.  We<br/>
should do this so that other people can have as much fun as possible.<br/>
<br/>
For the future:<br/>
I think we're going to have symbols on our maps which will tell<br/>
potential letterbox hunters what kind of letterbox it is, if it<br/>
is mapped or not and how accurate the mapping is.  So the rule<br/>
will be if there is a question mark it means the map is either vague<br/>
or non-existent, and that you are only located in the general vicinity.<br/>
If there is a cross say, it will mean the lat./long. is pinpointed<br/>
exactly.  This will help those who use GPS marks to orienteer.<br/>
If there is say, a red dot it means it is an accurate location to<br/>
the starting point but not to the letterbox itself.  These are things<br/>
people will have to know in order to understand how the hobby works.<br/>
<br/>
Etc., etc., etc.  The point is there are some rules that are necessary.<br/>
Please observe them to help make the hobby be as much fun as possible.<br/>
Within these rules there is also a tremendous amount of latitude<br/>
as to how to make a letterbox, devise clues, etc.  So this in no way<br/>
makes what we are doing rigid or overly structured.  We're all in it<br/>
for the fun first and foremost.  Even the maps are here to enjoy<br/>
and to help people get a feel for where they are and where letterboxes<br/>
are available.  Whatever rules we have are necessary to preserve the<br/>
fun and to make it possible for people to enjoy the hobby, given the <br/>
unusually large area we are covering and the variety of abilities of<br/>
different letterbox hunters.<br/>

<br/>
I must cast a dissenting opinion with Dan on the matter of clue writing,<br/>
however.  Writing clues is the part of the art that people see before<br/>
hunting for your box.  Therefore, I feel you can be as vague, impossible,<br/>
obscure, cryptic, etc., as your heart desires.  The reason is that people<br/>
read the clues before deciding if they want to chance looking for your<br/>
box.  If the clues are not to their liking, or they find them too vague<br/>
or cannot figure them out, or find them too easy, they can choose to <br/>
ignore your box and find another set of clues more to their taste.  Sort<br/>
of like music or any other art.  If you don't like rap, you won't listen<br/>
to it and maybe look for jazz or something.  Perhaps a better way to<br/>
conduct a discussion on clue writing conventions is to get comments from<br/>
hunters on what sorts of clues they like (although feedback from the<br/>
field should be sufficient for this), if one is concerned about the traffic<br/>
to one's box.<br/>
<br/>
While people may make the artistic choice to adopt the Dartmoor clue <br/>
writing conventions (or any other conventions they or we may develop),<br/>
I think its OK to do your own thing on some or all clues you write.  <br/>
That is what I do and will continue to do :-)  I think it could get <br/>
boring if clues always boiled down to 'take a couple bearings from <br/>
oak tree X'.  I think its fun to NOT find a box once in a while, <br/>
because it validates the thrill of successfully finding one (if you<br/>
know what I mean :-)).  I did not find the first letterbox I hunted <br/>
for, but I knew what I was getting into before setting out because <br/>
I had the clue in front of me, and I was aware of the risk of not <br/>
finding it.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, from the clues that I have already seen, I think they are <br/>
great, and do show alot of creative diversity, and target all skill<br/>
levels.  We can all make choices of which ones to hunt for.  I just <br/>
don't want to see that change, except for exploring new and diverse<br/>
areas in clue writing, which I, and hopefully others, will try to do<br/>
over the next few months.<br/>

<br/>
He says po-tA-to, I say po-Tah-to.  The point is there are rules,<br/>
conventions, etiquette or whatever you want to call it.  Its not a fair<br/>
assessment to say we have no rules.  We have to have some.<br/>
Its obviously also not fair to<br/>
suggest we are rules bound or overly structured.  Anyone who's been<br/>
on board for any length of time can plainly see that we have a wide<br/>
variety of styles, colors, maps, clues, etc. <br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I must cast a dissenting opinion with Dan on the matter of clue<br/>
&gt;  writing, however.<br/>
<br/>
I believe Randy misunderstood my reference to Trevor Dallas'<br/>
letter on clues writing.  This was to point out that there<br/>
are rules which go back to the roots of the hobby.  I was<br/>
hoping it would come across that, in general, there has been<br/>
some emphasis on clarity, whether or not the clues are difficult.<br/>
This has been a recurring theme among most of the people I've<br/>
talked to from Dartmoor.  With few exceptions, it is preferred<br/>
by most people to have solvable clues that have at least some<br/>
rationale or logic to them.  Its not hard to produce clues<br/>
that are solvable to almost nobody but the author.<br/>
<br/>
But,<br/>
Randy misunderstood me if he thought I was saying that it is a<br/>
rule that you have to make your clues just like those shown in<br/>
Trevor's letter.  That's not at all what I meant by referencing<br/>
it.  It was an example only.<br/>
<br/>
But, as I told Randy privately, I appreciate hearing his opinion.<br/>
I value it.  I also like his clues.  I show them as examples<br/>
because I think its cool to have some clues that are very difficult.<br/>
Some people will seek out exactly that type of clue.<br/>
<br/>
The gist of what I said in my earlier note is basically to admit<br/>
we have some rules, entirely unwritten mind you, without which<br/>
we would not have much of a game or hobby.  The rules we have are<br/>
what keeps this from being Orienteering, Dungeons and Dragons,<br/>
Scavenger Hunting or something else.  They also help to bear it<br/>
up under the unusual/varied conditions we have here in the U.S. Our<br/>
"rules" will be different than Dartmoor's and perhaps a lot more<br/>
varied even.  That's why I said<br/>
immediately following my reference to Trevor's letter about <br/>
clues writing that "We have also established some of our own<br/>
rules..." and I went on to mention all the stuff Randy (and<br/>
probably most of you) agreed with.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this makes it a little more clear.  If you want evidence of<br/>
my distaste for having a lot of rules look back in the archives at<br/>
some of my prior discussions with Eric Mings last fall.  Invariably,<br/>
he wanted to impose rules and I wanted it to remain free and open.<br/>
I like that we have evolved with multiple styles and I always will<br/>
support that at whatever level I can - as long as its tasteful<br/>
and demonstrates the same kind of decorum we've typically had among<br/>
our members.  We've shyed away from political statements like,<br/>
"Manifest Destiny!", "Save the Whales!", "Free Warren Spanno!",<br/>
etc...  I hope it stays that way.<br/>
<br/>
Typically, we've been<br/>
celebrating artists, poets, the history of our locales and landmarks,<br/>
etc. - the kind of stuff that is generally on all our hearts and<br/>
evokes in us a sense of gratitude.  Deborah's and Bonnie's clues<br/>
and quite a few others are dedications.  I'm really happy that some<br/>
of you take the time to do that.  It shows that you care about <br/>
the great people of our past.  Anyway, let's try to keep it light,<br/>
fun, and fun for the kids too please.  Once in a while<br/>
there should be a letterbox safe for a kid to find.  In fact, I plan<br/>
to make my next one a kid's letterbox.  It'll have an easy stamp<br/>
design too (because my carving skills are about equal to a kid's).<br/>
<br/>
Take care all.  Keep having lots of fun.<br/>

The gist of my post was to disagree.  I still do, but that's ok :-)<br/>
The term "framework" works for me.  We've inherited a wealth of<br/>
expericence, ideas, and the like from the folks on Dartmoor, for which<br/>
we are all grateful, but not a body of rules.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Once in a while there should be a letterbox safe for a kid to find.<br/>
<br/>
As I have said before, I found a note in one of my boxes from a kid<br/>
who said "make the next one harder please".  As mine may not be some of<br/>
the easier boxes, I *really* don't believe there is a problem with<br/>
clues being too hard, hence my general disagreement with Dan in this<br/>
regard.  Be bound only by your imagination in clue writing; I believe<br/>
it is ok to not find every box you hunt, and ok to write clues that not<br/>
everyone will decipher....<br/>

I'm with Randy on this one.  I think there should be no rules about writing clues.  I expect that when I follow a clue I may or may not find the box.  That's part of the fun.  There are no guarantees!  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I think that using maps and/or compass bearings should be entirely optional. There's room for all styles and preferences in this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if rules do develop on the Letterboxing USA web site, and you don't want to follow them, I guess you could always opt not to post your clues there. But it would be nicer if the Letterboxing USA site remains open to diversity and rule-free.<br/>

&gt;  it is ok to not find every box you hunt, and ok to write clues that not<br/>
&gt;  everyone will decipher....<br/>
<br/>
I agree wholeheartedly with you on this Randy.  The boxes I have hidden<br/>
thus far are pretty easy to find.  I like the idea that there are some<br/>
boxes out there that are nigh unto impossible to find.  If so warned,<br/>
the one who actually finds it can hop on the nearest fence and crow like<br/>
a rooster for his/her accomplishment.  That which is found too easily is<br/>
not long appreciated.....<br/>
<br/>
isn't that why we list difficulty, etc. with our clues?<br/>

&gt;  I'm with Randy on this one.  I think there should be no rules<br/>
&gt;  about writing clues.  I expect that when I follow a clue I may<br/>
&gt;  or may not find the box.  That's part of the fun. <br/>
<br/>
There are two different threads here.  One is the rules of the<br/>
hobby, which do exist.  Its important for newbies and other people<br/>
who would become interested to know this and to ask questions.<br/>
The other thread is the desire to have imaginative, creative and<br/>
sometimes difficult clues.  Clues can be clear and not be easy<br/>
or unimaginative.  Mostly, the clues have been<br/>
clear, the difficult ones as well.  But the things I pointed out in<br/>
my post are important for newbies to know.  Be clear and try<br/>
not to do things like I stated in my post where, for example,<br/>
you are telling the searcher to go to a certain spot (whether by<br/>
compass bearing or some other means) and it is the wrong place<br/>
entirely.  So when they get there, there is no way to resolve<br/>
it.  Its easier to do this than you might imagine.  I'm simply<br/>
stating that clues should be clues to get to some place, and that<br/>
it is easy in an attempt to be vague/tricky to unwittingly make it<br/>
impossible.  And I suppose there may be some weirdos who will<br/>
intentinally send you on a wild goose chase with no intention<br/>
of letting you find the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, even with easy clues, some people will not find your<br/>
letterbox.  But its easier than you might imagine to throw them<br/>
into a complete dead end.  If many clues were like this, it <br/>
would not be any fun, esp. for the kids who expect some kind of<br/>
reward for there effort... well, most of us are in it for that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Also, I think that using maps and/or compass bearings should be<br/>
&gt;  entirely optional. There's room for all styles and preferences<br/>
&gt;  in this hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Maps and compass bearings are optional.  The question mark symbol<br/>
will be a "non locale" locale, perhaps no more specific than a<br/>
region.  But the interface we have at Letterboxing USA beckons<br/>
location.  The country is<br/>
3000 miles across.  Somewhere there is a location for something<br/>
or there will be no place to start, even when driving your car.<br/>
But perhaps there should be an alphabetical index to clues that<br/>
simply have the location as part of the clue -- all you would<br/>
get is the state.  I'm open to that, although, again, it would<br/>
be easy to provide, not just imaginative, but impossible to<br/>
resolve clues by doing this.  Most everyone knows where Mount<br/>
Rushmore is, for instance.  Almost nobody knows where Warren<br/>
Spanno's old car is, and perhaps it cannot even be found through<br/>
research.  Its easy to think that what's common knowledge to you<br/>
should be understood by others but its not like that.  So try<br/>
to appreciate your audience and the people who would potentially<br/>
be searching out your letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
But an indexed section, we would want to keep separate from the<br/>
maps I think.  Needs some more thought... <br/>
<br/>
Again, try to be on the light side and keep it fun.  I don't want<br/>
to keep this thread going anymore if all we are discussing is <br/>
semantics.  Its silly to suggest we have no rules (or insist on<br/>
calling them courtesies or something else.)  All games/hobbies<br/>
have some rules.  It will only throw off newbies and young people<br/>
to suggest or imply that we do not have any.<br/>
