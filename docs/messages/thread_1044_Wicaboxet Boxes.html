RI are still right where they are supposed to be, however, the <br/>
Rattlesnake Ledge one is looking a little worse for wear. I guess <br/>
from now on I'll carry some ziplock bags to help keep some of the <br/>
older boxes weatherproof. This was a short little hike, to collect <br/>
two stamps, in the state of RI. The discovery of some blueberries <br/>
gave me cause for pause as well. And yes Bug, I got my two stamps. <br/>
Hope your trek in Virginia was a succesful one too. BTW, it was all <br/>
ledge, and no Rattlesnakes. Recommended to anyone looking for an easy <br/>
2 hour trek, but beware, the horseflies are huge, and you can't shake <br/>
em. They were with me all the while that I was walking, but gave me a <br/>
break while I sat and stamped in. Still, it was worth the trip. Enjoy.<br/>
