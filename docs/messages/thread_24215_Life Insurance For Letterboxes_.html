some time now:  How do I ensure my letterbox clues survive me?  <br/>
Notice I said clues, not the boxes themselves, since I don't have <br/>
much control over missing boxes.  I do, however, currently have <br/>
control over my clues and as a responsible letterboxer I keep them <br/>
updated as needed.  But what will happen after I'm gone?  Will the <br/>
clues be dumped into the Basement or taken off LBNA?  Will they be <br/>
listed as abandoned and put up for adoption?  And if so, what if <br/>
nobody adopts them?  Since my clues are on my own web page, which <br/>
LBNA links to, I would also have to make sure they didn't get deleted <br/>
by the Host Service once I'm gone.  I want my clues to continue <br/>
pointing to my boxes for as long as they exist, but how can I ensure <br/>
this?<br/>
<br/>
The only answer I have come up with that seems acceptable is that I <br/>
would have to "will" my boxes and clues to a letterboxer friend or <br/>
family member (preferable much younger).  The problem here is that it <br/>
would be quite a burden since I have so many boxes, and there would <br/>
be no guarantee they would continue doing it.<br/>
<br/>
So, if I'm gone and nobody takes over my boxes, what would become of <br/>
my clues?  I would hope that LBNA would not delete them just because <br/>
I don't participate anymore since the boxes might still be fine.  The <br/>
feature on LBNA that lets you log your finds and attempts could serve <br/>
as a kind of status as long as boxers are diligent using it.  For <br/>
example, if one of my boxes shows that the last one or two <br/>
were "attempts" instead of "finds", you could probably assume this <br/>
box is gone and not look for it.  I would prefer this over not having <br/>
the clues out there at all.<br/>
<br/>
I'm curious if anyone else has thought about this and what solutions <br/>
you have come up with?<br/>

I've always promised myself I would either pick up all my boxes or adopt<br/>
them out if I decided to quit.  But I never thought what would happen if I<br/>
got hit by a bus before the adoptions were in place!<br/>
<br/>

arranging for my boxes before That Great Bus in the Forest strikes (and we<br/>
all know how many close calls we've ALL had without that crazy Tour Bus on<br/>

demise or through direct assignments to other boxers.  A document to be<br/>
presented to Webmasters to let them know my intent.  OR - I wonder if we<br/>
could convince them to give us a field on our boxes naming our boxing<br/>
executor or our intended godparents for specific boxes.  That would surely<br/>
help them too, wouldn't it?<br/>
<br/>
What about simply exchanging passwords with another trusted letterboxer?<br/>

<br/>
I think you should check with Choi regarding LbNA, and Ryan for AQ.<br/>
There are procedures in place to archive clues.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be a wet blanket, but when Gwen and I are no longer vertical <br/>
I would hope that someone would just adopt our letterboxes. If that <br/>
isn't the case, then that is too bad. Worrying about someone that <br/>
can't find a letterbox due to our not maintaining clues when we are <br/>
dead isn't real high on my priority list.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;I only have thirty something boxes, but there are some folks with <br/>
&gt;over a thousand and that could be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
200 or 300, but I've never heard of anyone with 1000. Who might that <br/>
be? <br/>
<br/>
Folks this is really a great hobby/game, but put it in context. <br/>
Leaving a legacy of letterbox clues, that should be waaaay down the <br/>
line when it comes to your demise.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, I'm thinking of a new HHer..."What to do with my letterbox <br/>
clues when I die".<br/>

I also think it is a two-point issue:<br/>
<br/>
1) Who will take responsibility to care for or retrieve the boxer's boxes?<br/>
<br/>
2) Who will take responsibility for managing their clues?<br/>
<br/>
It's possible one person could manage all the clues, at least long enough to<br/>
farm out the physical care of the boxes to someone in close proximity and<br/>
transfer the clue ownership to them.  But who decides what the outcome is<br/>
for the box itself - if no one can care for it, does someone take it upon<br/>
themselves to pick it up when they are in the area?  Or do we just let it<br/>
sit out there until it is defunct?<br/>

&gt; serve<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as a kind of status as long as boxers are diligent using it. For<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; example, if one of my boxes shows that the last one or two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were "attempts" instead of "finds", you could probably assume this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box is gone and not look for it. I would prefer this over not<br/>
&gt; having<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the clues out there at all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm curious if anyone else has thought about this and what<br/>
&gt; solutions<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you have come up with?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">True, but I thought it was a topic worth discussing, especially <br/>
since this is a Letterbox Discussion Group.  There is more to it <br/>
than leaving a legacy of letterboxes to future finders, though that <br/>
is part of it.  It is more about keeping a method of finding boxes <br/>
so they don't become just so much litter.  I don't assume for a <br/>
minute that any of my boxes will be missed by future generations, <br/>
but I think many would agree there are some boxes worth saving (e.g. <br/>
the first letterbox).  I was hoping a little brainstorming with my <br/>
peers would bring up some good ideas, but I guess this topic is not <br/>
interesting enough.  It does seem appropriate to talk about <br/>
resurrecting boxes on Easter, though.  <br/>

&gt; Folks this is really a great hobby/game, but put it in context. <br/>
&gt; Leaving a legacy of letterbox clues, that should be waaaay down <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; line when it comes to your demise.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmmm, I'm thinking of a new HHer..."What to do with my letterbox <br/>
&gt; clues when I die".<br/>

<br/>
If it bothers you (now) to leave letterboxes unmaintained (later) just <br/>
edit the boxes  before you kick the bucket and post a note saying they <br/>
are up for adoption when ever you go horizontal, or notify the <br/>
webmasters of your intentions. Someone will jump in and adopt.<br/>
