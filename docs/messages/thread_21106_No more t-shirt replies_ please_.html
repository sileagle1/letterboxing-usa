I think maybe the best way to handle this sort of thing from now on <br/>
is to send a message to that person alone rather than post to the <br/>
boards if you feel like you want to disagree. If you don't get <br/>
acknowledgement, THEN post on the boards. Really, the only purpose a <br/>
board serves to to get your message across to a lot of people. I'm <br/>
assuming Don only wanted ME to know that he didn't agree with me, not <br/>
that he didn't agree with LBNA as a whole. Unfortunately, that's what <br/>
he ended up with. <br/>
<br/>
I did reply on the boards, which should have ended it, but I think <br/>
others felt the need to come to my rescue after reading the whole <br/>
thing, which, although kind, was also unnecessary. By the time Don <br/>
returned, I'm sure he felt the need to reply, so it just became the <br/>
vicious cycle that all these arguements become.<br/>
<br/>
This board has the option to reply to just one person and I think <br/>
more people might listen to what another has to say (or feel <br/>
comfortable taking criticism) if folks just replied politely to them <br/>
with comments. If we could, I'd like to just let this go and get back <br/>
to regular boxing stuff. It really was something between Don and I <br/>
and I'm taking it off boards just for that. <br/>

&gt; Thanks Phyto<br/>
&gt; I think some folks don't wish to hear other opinions, but <br/>
thankfully <br/>
&gt; this forum does allow civil discourse.<br/>
