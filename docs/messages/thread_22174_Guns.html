                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to thank you Barefoot lucy for your support.  The things you <br/>
said about our neck of the woods is so true.  Just about everyone <br/>
around here has a concealed gun license.  Most of the time when I <br/>
box I have another adult with me.  On the day in question I did not <br/>
and it made me feel a little safer.  However I never intended for <br/>
any discussion to occur from my reply to Silver Eagle.  I do not <br/>
normally carry a gun nor did we own a gun but about 2 1/2 months ago <br/>
a man walked into my neighbors house at 2:30 in the afternoon and <br/>
attacked her.  I was at home with my garage door open and my doors <br/>
unlocked as were most of the neighbors that live around us.  After <br/>
this my husband purchased a pistol to keep at our home.  Of course <br/>
this individual was let out of jail due to overcrowding and I sure <br/>
feel better knowing if someone got in my home I would have at least <br/>
a chance.  However due to the sparks flying I will definitely invest <br/>
in some pepper spray to take with me if needed from now on.  Once <br/>
again thanks Lucy for enlightening people of our area and I just <br/>
basically wanted to remind everyone to please be aware of your <br/>
surroundings and be safe.<br/>

<br/>
I think we should all be carrying guns. Even better yet, let's all <br/>
shoot first and .... and well, hell with asking questions, let's all <br/>
just shoot first, let God sort them out is what I say. Maybe with <br/>
some luck, one of us will wing that LetterBoxing Crook guy. At the <br/>
very least we will thin the pack. The weaker, slower, folk will <br/>
eventually be weaded out and we will all be better off in the end. <br/>
I'm sawing off a shotgun in the celler as we speak.<br/>
