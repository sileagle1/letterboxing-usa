use is PZ Kut from http://www.stampeaz.com/ <br/>
It's so easy to carve and mount on 1/4" or 5mm fun foam available in<br/>
crafts stores like JoAnn's.  The foam will give a firm back for<br/>
printing but won't warp...provided "Goop" is NOT used for glue.  I use<br/>
"Elmer's Craft Bond Ultra Sticks All", other boxers use 5 minute<br/>
epoxy.  The foam can also be cut with scissors.<br/>

The newboxers group is a great resource for newcomers:<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
both with conversation, archives and growing files of information.<br/>

Well DANG!  I'd figured out the foam backing trick myself, but I've been <br/>
going CRAZY trying to figure out why I couldn't get a nice non warped<br/>
stamp.  Of course I've been using Goop.  I'll get out and buy some Elmer's <br/>
as soon as possible.  Thanks Catbead for a timely post as I have a couple of <br/>
stamps to mount.<br/>

Hey Werewulf good to see you back!<br/>
<br/>
I ran out of Elmers one day and used Goop instead.  Oops.  The Goop<br/>
and foam combo severely warped a stamp that took me over 9 hours to<br/>
carve, and the stamp had to be mailed off that day.  I thought the<br/>
thing was destroyed.  Goop made the PZKut swell up and feel brittle<br/>
both at the same time, plus it smelled like xylene.  Yuck.  I saved<br/>
the stamp by letting it air out for a few hours to get the stink out,<br/>
then regluing with Elmers and put it in a press with weight on it for<br/>
about 6 hours while the glue cured.  What a relief to see it was flat<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
