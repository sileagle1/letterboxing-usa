Molly, and the Needeeps, helped me surpass my daily record of 20!  Today, I got a <br/>
whole 32 stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Butterfly, Bluebird and I went up to Pomfret and found all 22 of the Jumble <br/>
Series!  We also found the Camera and Film, Table Rock, Catch Up, We the <br/>
People, Friendship, Jody and Sam, Bafflin Nature Ctr. letterboxes, and Pomfret <br/>
Center.<br/>
<br/>
You're probably saying.... ok.... that's 31.  Well, we did find 32, but one's <br/>
a secret :-)<br/>
<br/>
Due to Father's Day tomorrow and singing in church, I doubt I'll get out to <br/>
do any boxing tomorrow, so that's all until Monday!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!  Thanks Butterfly and Bluebird for a great day!<br/>

stamped in.  Hope to see you on the trails again.  Dan of (Teach &amp; <br/>

I'm doing this summer and I introduced her to letterboxing!  I guess she signed <br/>

Hope you get your first box soon Val!  Or will you be called Disney Girl, <br/>
