Gleeful from the news that people had in fact found and enjoyed the first <br/>
box we planted....  BeMa set out to plant a second box (which has been <br/>
sitting on the kitchen counter for a couple of weeks).<br/>
<br/>
This box is in infamous commemoration of "The Mole"  Robert Hanssen, who, <br/>
just blocks from where we used to live and walk our dog, betrayed his <br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to place it on a date of historical significance, but then would <br/>
have to wait until February when he was arrested or May when he was <br/>
sentenced (too long).  Instead, the day was sunny, the air was fresh and we <br/>
were happy -- so we planted it yesterday.  After the fact, we discovered <br/>
that CBS is coming out with a mini-series starring William Hurt about the <br/>
whole sad, messy affair (the spying, not the boxing).  Interesting timing <br/>
after all.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  This is our first hand carved stamp and, even with three different <br/>
colors of ink, it is a little hard to tell what it is supposed to be....<br/>
<br/>
THE MOLE<br/>
Foxstone Park<br/>
1910 Creek Crossing<br/>
Vienna, VA<br/>
<br/>
Placed by BeMa on Nov. 3rd, 2002<br/>

Inmate #48551-083/D cannot go boxing.  Nor can he do much else. Because, on <br/>
Sunday, February 18th, 2001 at this very unpretentious suburban park (our <br/>
best babysitter's house backs up to it) he was arrested for betraying his <br/>
country.  He betrayed his family, his company (or should I say bureau) the <br/>
FBI, the Russians aiding the U.S. whose identities he divulged, for money.  <br/>
Inmate #48551-083D, as of his sentencing on May 10, 2002, now resides in a <br/>
super maximum security prison in Colorado -- for life.  This man was Robert <br/>
Hanssen.<br/>
<br/>
In an effort to commemorate a little bit of history and perhaps erase some <br/>
of the stigma caused by his actions, we dedicate this letterbox.  You need <br/>
no money to enjoy it and you can spend some time with your family.  Let's <br/>
let the true purpose of this little park shine through!<br/>
<br/>
The entrance to Foxstone Park is very small and easy to miss.  It is nestled <br/>
in the woods on the side of Creek Crossing in Vienna.  From Tysons Corner, <br/>
off the Beltway, take 123 into Vienna.  Take a right onto East Street.  Go <br/>
through the first stop sign (intersection with Church Street).  At the next <br/>
stop sign, take a right onto Creek Crossing.  Before the hill heads back up <br/>
again, on the right, is a cul de sac owned by the town of Vienna.  You can't <br/>
dump there, but you should be able to park.  If you pass Fairway Drive <br/>
you've gone too far (which isn't a good thing 'cause then you would be too <br/>
close our old house and would see what a mess they made out of the <br/>
landscaping....).  The entrance to Foxstone Park is across Creek Crossing <br/>
opposite to this cul de sac.<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park and take the path to the right.  Follow this wide paved path <br/>
feeling free to crunch on all the leaves.  Pass the very old swing set and <br/>
concrete tunnel on the left.<br/>
<br/>
Continue down the path (if you go off of it you might get mired in the mud!) <br/>
and cross over the bridge.  Pass by an above ground sewer manhole marked <br/>
with an "s"  Cross over the stream by way of the stepping stones further <br/>
ahead on the left.  Back on dry land, take the path to the right and <br/>
continue deeper into the park.  Pass between the metal bars and cross over <br/>
the bridge to your right.  We know this puts you right back on the first <br/>
path, but it's a fun little excursion.  After all, who doesn't like crossing <br/>
bridges and stepping stones?!<br/>
<br/>
We believe, after looking at all the bridges and comparing them with the <br/>
news clippings, that this last bridge may have been the drop site for the <br/>
spy and his Russian handlers.<br/>
<br/>
After crossing the bridge, and contemplating this sad state of affairs, you <br/>
may need a dose of innocence.  So, stand and gaze ahead at the playground, <br/>
looking for a goofy yellow smile...  With your back to Mr.. yellow goofy <br/>
guy's smile, look North and you will spot two above ground septic manholes.  <br/>
Go to them.  Cross over the gulley/dry stream bed to the right as you are <br/>
facing the manholes.  On the other bank, take a reading of 290 degrees and <br/>
look for the Three Bear Tree.  Well, that's what we called 'em 'cause there <br/>
was a big "papa bear" tree, a medium "mama bear" one and a smaller "baby <br/>
bear" one that all seem to be growing out of the same trunk.  "THE MOLE" has <br/>
dug under some branches and leaves at the base of these trunks.  Be careful <br/>
of the thorn bushes around.<br/>
<br/>
Once you've found the stamp and successfully figured out just what it was <br/>
supposed to be... enjoy yourselves on the playground -- it's a far cry from <br/>
a cement cell....<br/>
