<p>MARCH 20, 2003</p>
<p>VERNAL EQUINOX SUNRISE DANCE ON LANTERN HILL</p>
<p>The Westerly Morris Men will celebrate the Vernal Equinox by dancing at dawn on the summit of Lantern Hill in North Stonington, Connecticut. Participants in the hike and festivities will start meeting at the base of the hill at 5:00 A.M. on Thursday, March 20. By 5:20 A.M., all present will start the 10-20 minute hike to the summit. Sunrise will occur at about 5:52 A.M. (Source: U.S. Naval Observatory ).</p>
<p>Lantern Hill is located on the Ledyard / North Stonington town line, just south of Route 2. The trailhead is on Wintechog Hill Road, which is one road east of Lantern Hill Road / Route 214, the location of the Foxwoods Casino. The trailhead is less than 1/4 mile south of Route 2.</p><b>
<p>The public is invited and welcome to this open annual event.</p></b> Typically, 70 or more people make this early morning trek.
<p>check the team web site at http://raj.dhs.org/terrycran/Westerly_Morris_Men.html .</p><b>
</b><p>This event occurs regardless of the weather, <u>solely</u> at the discretion of the participants.</p>
<p>The actual Equinox will occur at 8:00 PM EST, March 20 (Source: U.S. Naval Observatory via the National Weather Service web site at <u>http://www.crh.noaa.gov/ind/seasons.txt</u>). This hike traditionally occurs at the dawn of the day in which the Equinox falls in the Eastern Time Zone. According to the Weather Service web site, the Vernal Equinox will occur on March 20 through the year 2015, therefore, long-range planners can place this event on their calendars on March 20 every year through 2015! Note that some current calendars misleadingly state that spring begins on March 21. These calendars were probably printed in Europe or Asia and are correct for the time zone in which they were printed, but are incorrect for North &amp; South America (e.g., at 8:00 PM on March 20 in Connecticut it is 1:00 AM on March 21 in England).</p>
