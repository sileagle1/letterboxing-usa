no mail on the group and just check the yahoo site occasionally. <br/>
If anyone has questions about any boxes I planted, or anything <br/>
else, you will need to contact me directly as I am not sure how <br/>
often I will be checking the list. I just have too much else going <br/>
on and not enough time to monitor the list traffic. Thanks much.<br/>
