<br/>
My wife and I just returned home to<br/>
Oregon from a very HOT and HUMID vacation <br/>
in New England, adding 13 new images to<br/>
our collection.  These include:<br/>
<br/>
MAINE:  <br/>
&gt; The Blueberry Hill LB -- a fun jaunt through <br/>
rippening blueberry country, where we introduced<br/>
our nieces and nephew to Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; West Quoddy Light LB -- a cool and foggy day, just<br/>
perfect for finding this one.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Fields Pond LB (2) -- wild Loons called to us<br/>
from across the lake!<br/>
<br/>
VERMONT:<br/>
&gt; Cemetary Walk LB -- forget them not.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Working On The Railroad LB -- had fun trying to <br/>
remember those words from childhood songs--eeeek!<br/>
An excellent hand carved stamp for your collections.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Covered Bridge LB -- a really wonderful hand carved stamp and<br/>
well worth the effort!<br/>
<br/>
NEW HAMPSHIRE:<br/>
&gt; Susie Sells Seashells LB -- interesting and humorous criminal <br/>
history with this box!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sea Coast 2 LB -- don't forget to bring a $3 entry<br/>
fee (per person!!) to get in, or maybe go off season.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hear The Sea LB -- great site to explore to boot.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Portsmouth Harbor Light LB -- WE WERE THE FIRST!  Box was<br/>
placed in May 2001, by Lone Mass Wolf, and I guess it just took some <br/>
keen west coast boxers to come out and find this box for you all. ;o) <br/>
Thanks for the challenge and fun! <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Live Free Or Die LB -- found this box at a beautiful spot and<br/>
as a bonus we picked up the hitchhiker...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;"Cling Clang", who is now on his way to "see the world", as<br/>
requested.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to all of you out there who placed these boxes and the <br/>
fun we had hunting for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Until next time,<br/>

It sounds like you had big fun in New England hunting down letterboxes!<br/>
Sorry we missed you at the August event, though it sounds like you were<br/>
truly in letterboxing heaven where you vacationed.  Glad you're back and<br/>
glad you had such a great time.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
