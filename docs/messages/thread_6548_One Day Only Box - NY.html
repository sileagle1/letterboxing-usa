<br/>
There's an annual event held here in Tompkins County, NY called Farm City <br/>
Day and this year event organizers (okay, I'm in charge) are hiding a <br/>
couple geocache/letterbox hybrids on the host farm as a way of <br/>
demonstrating the use of GPS technology and tying it into precision <br/>
farming.  We have a 4-H group that works with our Ag in the Classroom <br/>
program using hand held GPS units.  These teens will be leading interested <br/>
event attendees through the process of using the hand held units to locate <br/>
the hidden boxes.  Inside each will be both treats and a stamp and log book.<br/>
<br/>
The event is Saturday, August 10th from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Hardie Farm <br/>
Inc., located at 31 Holden Road in Lansing NY.  If interested in attending, <br/>
you can check Mapquest for the best directions from your home.  I'd also be <br/>
happy to send anyone an event brochure - email me at DLT22@cornell.edu<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>
Debbie T (the Bee)<br/>
