<div>Bummer luck at the Bull Run library part II.  Did we mention that we also failed to find the Letterbox Book box?  Yup!  (It's like Claude Moore Park all over again!)  We had some great ideas and our fingers flew over the catalog keyboard, but, to no avail.  How many boxes was that mystery letterboxer hoarding?!...  We even checked the ladies room for stampers (well, at least the female members of the team did...)  Nothin'!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, like all those who seek a lofty goal, yet, fall short, we hung our heads, climbed in the SUV and headed home.  Dad to take a nap.  Mom to eat some brownies (with mini M&amp;M's no less) and the kids to space out watching more Sponge Bob (whole episodes of which they were repeating the dialogue of in the car on the way home!...)  Oh well!  BeMa</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm delighted that you are looking for The Letterbox Book.  As I said <br/>
when I posted I am nervous that it is too hard.  After all I like the <br/>
idea of some hard to find letterboxes BUT NOT this one.<br/>
<br/>
S P O I L E R   A L E R T<br/>
<br/>
If you don't want a hint get out now!  I am going to give y'all a <br/>
hint but first prattle on give some random text to hide the hint from <br/>
anyone who doesn't want to accidently read it.  What 'exactly' are <br/>
you looking for?  Is there anything in the story that will help you <br/>
find 'what "you" are looking for?'  And now some more random text <br/>
padding after the supposed and mysterious hint. Blah blah blah.  Do <br/>
write with your opinion on whether I need to alter the clues a <br/>
little, just a little or just that you personally want more.<br/>
<br/>
In any case you are already fulfilling part one of the book's <br/>
intentions, namely to get to explore the library and find other books <br/>
that interest you. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
