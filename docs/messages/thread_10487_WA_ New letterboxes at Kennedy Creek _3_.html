Kennedy Creek is a small Dept of Fish and Wildlife area devoted to <br/>
education of citizens about the salmon and the habitat.  Peak season <br/>
for a visit is late October through November.  This facility is used <br/>
for school education so may be busy during this time.   However, it <br/>
is a very nice venue anytime.  <br/>
<br/>
Visit www.wa.gov/wdfw/fish/chum/viewingchum_kennedy.htm to learn <br/>
about this venue, and to read more about fish culture and populations <br/>
in Puget Sound.  <br/>
<br/>
Nearby Letterboxes abound in the greater Olympia, Thurston County <br/>
area.  Fudrick's "Frye Cove" boxes at the Steamboat Island Rd. exit <br/>
are closest.<br/>
<br/>
Driving directions:  From I-5 in Olympia take exit 104 (Aberdeen, <br/>
Shelton, Ocean Beaches) westbound.  Watch for the whimsical Bovine <br/>
Family on the south (left) side of the road.  After you spot them <br/>
will be the junction of Hwy 101 and Hwy 8.  Continue on Hwy 101 to <br/>
milepost 356; be in the left hand lane to make a left hand turn at <br/>
this point.  This road crossing will be after a gradual right hand <br/>
turn and you will just start to see the water of the Kennedy Creek / <br/>
Puget Sound confluence.  Turn left across the highway onto the Old <br/>
Olympic Highway.  Continue on this loop road for 0.7 mile to a gravel <br/>
road on the right.  A sign "Kennedy Creek" will be on a tree high on <br/>
the right.  The road has a gate and there might be a sign posting the <br/>
road as closed.  While there is logging activity at this time, it is <br/>
permissible to pass.  On weekday visits be aware and prepared to <br/>
stop.  Drive 0.5 mile.  As you pass through the power line clearing <br/>
and past another smaller gate swing right into a parking area that <br/>
has two stone circles in the middle.  You have arrived.<br/>
<br/>
These boxes were placed for a Boy Scout event and there are boxes by <br/>
other South Puget Sound LBrs here.  We hope you enjoy your visit.<br/>

Salmonberry<br/>
<br/>
Salmonberry was so named as it was widely used by the local people to <br/>
cut the oils in preserved salmon.  Many fruits were used in this <br/>
fashion.  <br/>
