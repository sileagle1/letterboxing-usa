<div>Do many letterboxers carry colored ink pens (as opposed to or along with 
ink pads)? I was just wondering since some of the boxes Lottabit and I have 
hidden lately have stamps that look best in color.</div>

and I've used them with one of your recent stamps!  (As recommended <br/>
previously on this list, I color directly on the stamp with the marker--then <br/>
"huff" on it to moisten the colors before stamping in.)  Whadda difference!  <br/>
My more recent additions are much prettier and more interesting than the <br/>
first monochrome images in my notebook.  <br/>

I was also glad I had the pens on the coast for Ryan, Funhog, &amp; Paisley <br/>

YES! I carry pens and pads and I have these nifty little things <br/>
called dabbers that are little ink pads that look like lipsticks. <br/>
I like lots of color choices :-)<br/>

<br/>
Where I come from, very few boxes have their own stamp pads, although <br/>
I've heard the practice is MUCH more common on the east coast.  <br/>
(That's just through the rumor mill, though--I've never found any <br/>
east coast boxes before!)<br/>
<br/>
But I'd NEVER go without my own stamp pads while hunting down a box.  <br/>
Even if you know the letterbox you're looking for is supposed to have <br/>
them, you can't be sure it's not frozen solid, dried up, or otherwise <br/>
incapcitated or missing.  Consequently, I always assume the finder is <br/>
going to bring their own stamp pads.<br/>
<br/>
But if you feel a stamp pad in a special color would really add to <br/>
your letterbox, go for it.  I'm actually thinking I might be hiding <br/>
my first letterbox with a stamp pad (or two or three!) included!  =)  <br/>
I can't go telling any secrets about the box (mostly because it's <br/>
still being planned), but I have my reasons for wanting to include <br/>
stamp pads to go with it.  But it's not really necessary either....<br/>
