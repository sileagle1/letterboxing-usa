<div>Thanks for the reply! I told my friend that somebody here would have an 
idea.  Will have to give it another try.  Actually, there were a 
lot of quartz slabs there... sort of wondering if we were by the right "large 
pine tree".  It was the biggest tree and above the confluence on the 
Middle Fork side.  Didn't want to poke around too much since the rattlers 
are on the move right now (shedding their skins).  I hope it's still there 
am looking forward to getting hooked on this hobby! </div>
<div>As always, the drive and hike were worth it, though!</div>
<div>Thanks again!</div>
<div>The Wildest Hare<br/><br/>  .My guess is that you probably are the first 
to go for this box as it is in an area not frequented by many boxers . While 
there may be many grey rocks around a river there are not that many " large gray 
rocks on a quartz slab 2-3 ft west / northwest from a large pine tree above the 
confluence " Don  <br/></div></body></html>
