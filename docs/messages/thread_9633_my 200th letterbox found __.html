                    <div class="plaintext-content">At long last --- last night I found my 200th letterbox.  Went to <br/>
Brenton Pt in Newport, RI after work.  It was fairly dark out when we <br/>
got there.  If you have never been to Brenton Pt it is a beautiful <br/>
spot to watch the sunset over Narragansett Bay.  Last night was no <br/>
exception, the sunset was magnificant!<br/>
<br/>
The box, Brenton Reef (the first box in the Fast Passage series) was <br/>
in excellent shape.  This box is 3 years old and still has the <br/>
original log book in it. Lots of letterboxing history here.<br/>

                    <html><body>Congrats!  I'm almost there, but not quite!  Only 15 more to go!  I should get to 200 during Christmas break, but won't get there before then due to a term paper being due and five more school concerts!
<br/>
<br/>I found Brenton Point before I had found letterboxing!  I also like to play amateur photographer and was looking for the Castle Hill Lighthouse.  One of the days I was at Brenton Point, there was a HUGE kite convention!  Connectikiters I believe.  The wind there is great for kites, and it was amazing to see all of the huge kites in the air!  It was very colorful!
<br/>
<br/>I too found the Brenton Point box (and Castle Hill letterbox) this fall.  Both were in good shape and it was nice to see the lighthouse again!
