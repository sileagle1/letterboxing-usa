&gt;I was not surprised to see that Pete and Wanda were first to find ESAK's<br/>
&gt;Timberlin Park letterboxes. Which got me to thinking: has anyone else besides<br/>
&gt;me come to believe that there must be a number of "Pete and Wanda" clones<br/>
&gt;combing this part of the Letterboxing Realm in search of every new letterbox?<br/>
&gt;How else to explain the fact that this wily couple is almost always the first<br/>
&gt;pair of 'boxers to triumphantly find and stamp in to every new letterbox<br/>
&gt;within a 100-mile radius of their home? Or perhaps there are "Pete and Wanda"<br/>
&gt;impersonators among us who, having surreptitously counterfitted this duo's<br/>
&gt;signature stamps, now go about the countryside pretending to be Pete and<br/>
&gt;Wanda upon first finding a new box. What exactly is going on here?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All I know is that I have met Pete. By himself. There were others there who <br/>
can corroborate this. If there is a Wanda, and I only say if because I have <br/>
never met her, then she is a mysterious character indeed. Far be it from me <br/>
to suggest that there is no Wanda though.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I stamped in at a letterbox in Gorham, Maine this past summer <br/>
and noted that Wanda, by herself, had previously stamped in there too. So <br/>
someone is claiming to be Wanda. It wasn't far from Sunday River Brewing <br/>
Company either. I'm not sure if there's a connection there, but the beer <br/>
was good afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, my kids and I have always felt that Dan &amp; Melissa were the king <br/>
and queen of first stampers. They've been first to at least 839 of <br/>
Drewclan's 45,324 planted boxes here in eastern CT. We have met both of <br/>
them. Together. The same time we met Pete.<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute. Maybe there's a connection there too.<br/>
<br/>
I have it.<br/>
<br/>
Dan &amp; Melissa are really Pete and Wanda, and the Pete I met was a paid <br/>
actor to throw us off. Wanda is probably a figment of somebody's <br/>
imagination. As for the Maine Wanda? Someone simply has a wandering <br/>
imagination.<br/>

Anybody hungry? I make a mean Thanksgiving day meal, with the best Apple <br/>
Crumb pie you never tasted. The cranberry sauce is the greatest too. Come <br/>
on over. Pete and Wanda will be there.    :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Thanksgiving to all and please pardon my indulgence. <br/>
