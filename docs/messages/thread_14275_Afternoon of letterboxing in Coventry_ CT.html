  "When I was a Girl in Martin Box" series--incredible <br/>
dialogue/description with  clues-based on a biographical novel <br/>

series. Stamps are lovely.  Box #2 is SOOO hard to retrieve without <br/>
being seen by passing cars. Mission accomplished, though.<br/>
  "Eternal Love" placed in the most restful spot one could imagine, <br/>
an ancient backroad cemetary. Touching story, perfect stamp.<br/>
  "John Wayne series"- I got such a kick out of this set of stamps <br/>
and clues.  Lots of fun trivia about the big guy's movies. I adored <br/>
True Grit as a high schooler.this series was the result of a  <br/>
colaboration between Irishtinker the carver and Odilio &amp; Joisey Girl, <br/>
noe of who'm I've met as yet.   Teach and Preach were there the very <br/>
same day!  So sorry to have missed them.<br/>
