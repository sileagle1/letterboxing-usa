                    <div class="plaintext-content">My older daughter and I went to Angela's for the first time today.  I've <br/>
been near there a million times, but either was in a hurry or it wasn't <br/>
yet open.  Looked around; got a demo of the new "magnetic poetry" stamp <br/>
kit.  I put my name on a waiting list for a cute snowglobe stamp Angela <br/>
has on order.  Found Angela's letterbox; chatted with Angela and the <br/>
placer, both of whom happened to be in while we were there (though the <br/>
latter didn't have her personal stamp along, so we couldn't do an <br/>
exchange this time :-&lt;).  Big, pretty box, in great shape.  Indoor boxes <br/>
do have some benefits and flexibility ;-&gt;  I pulled out a new book for <br/>
Miss M to use as her own journal instead of sharing mine; she was very <br/>
excited.  Our old purple stamp pad was running low on ink and doesn't <br/>
stamp large images well if at all, so before we left we picked up some <br/>
new stamp pads.<br/>
<br/>
We then dropped some books at the library (what, there's no Reston <br/>
Regional letterbox yet?) and went back to Walker Nature Education Center <br/>
to try out our new inkpads.  Found the Walker Bridge Troll - great stamp <br/>
(location got us for a few minutes); first finders!  Went along the path <br/>
a bit further to the second of the Audubon boxes, so we could restamp <br/>
(and so Miss M could stamp it into her book).  Our new inkpads are very <br/>
pretty but run :-&lt; when raindrops hit them directly.<br/>
<br/>
Then back home - a drizzly but good stamping afternoon (it's what, 50-60 <br/>
degrees out in December?) :-&gt;  Happy Chanukah, all (tonight's the first <br/>
night)!<br/>
