                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all ... heading to Barcelona, Spain this Friday for 10 days on <br/>
business.  I'll have 3 days to myself.<br/>
<br/>
I took a look to see if there were any letterboxes there, but came <br/>
up empty.  The idea of planting one came to mind, but as I'll likely <br/>
not return to Barcelona for a long time I'm not particularly <br/>
interested in planting a box I'll never see again.<br/>
<br/>
But others of you out there might be, and I know there are boxes <br/>
people have placed in far-away places.  SO ... if I'm able to find a <br/>
place for the box and you want to put one there, I'll take it.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the catch.  I need it in my hands by this Thursday and it <br/>
needs to be a fairly small box (not necessarily a micro-box, but <br/>
small enough to carry with luggage -- a 10-cup Rubbermaid container <br/>
is more than I'm willing to carry!!)<br/>
<br/>
If interested, let me know ASAP.  Otherwise, see you all in August!<br/>
