                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, this old dinosaur has decided to crawl out of the cave and <br/>
reply to the current posts. As a letterboxer who got herself in BIG <br/>
trouble with the Army Corp of Engineers for placing letterboxes on <br/>
Government land without permission I think I have a few things to <br/>
say. <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately when my illegal letterbox was found it was clearly <br/>
marked on the outside with MY contact information and the <br/>
Letterboxing.org website so instead of calling the National Guard <br/>
they called me instead. After a bit of explaining and apologizing <br/>
they issued me a free permit and I am now the only letterboxer <br/>
allowed to place boxes at Hop Brook Park. At least I can only "Hope" <br/>
I am.<br/>
<br/>
I also worked with these very same rangers to place the very first <br/>
completely handicapped accessible letterbox. They provided <br/>
the "mailbox" like structure and I provided the letterbox. It was a <br/>
very cool experience. <br/>
<br/>
The primary concern for rangers, as Punky commented is public safety <br/>
and a hidden anything on public property can set off a huge alarm. I <br/>
think it is up to the individual to contact the land owners for <br/>
permission if permission is not grant go someplace else. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As far as Letterboxers organizing I think that is a ridiculous <br/>
notion. What next will there will be a fee to access clues, I <br/>
already hear rumors about a secret handshake. Where will it end!!<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing really is a "to each his own" sort of sport and I hope <br/>
it can stay that way. <br/>
<br/>
I think it's time for a Gerbil Gathering.....any dinosaurs agree?<br/>
