                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a gentle reminder to put the state or state abbreviation in <br/>
the subject line of posts regarding boxes.  It's easy to forget <br/>
something like that -- I know I am guilty of things like this-- but a <br/>
little reminder now and then can't hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Portland, OR, not on the East coast where you are tripping <br/>
over boxes (though Portland has apprx. 200, so I shouldn't complain!) <br/>
and when some of you are referencing boxes, I don't know where they <br/>
are.  Even if someone has mentioned it before, I have probably <br/>
skipped over the original post because of the state reference. <br/>
<br/>
This is not a rant, this is not a finger pointing the first time ever <br/>
someone forgets (because, like I said, we can all be there), this is <br/>
just a gentle reminder.<br/>
<br/>
I am fairly new to this sport, and I have been loving the fact that <br/>
we are connected from all across the country here at this board.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could have gone to the Prayer Rock to honor the Vermont <br/>
Viking, but I was able to hear about it here.  That meant so much to <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
For those who have been doing this longer:  Thank you.  I am enjoying <br/>
this so much.  And, I am overdue in posting my recent Coastal boxing <br/>
experiences.<br/>
<br/>
You'll be hearing from me soon!<br/>
