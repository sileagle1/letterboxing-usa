I am a recent convert as well--thanks to that same article.  I usually<br/>
search with my 6yo, 4.5 yo and 16 m o, so I know what you are experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few thigns that have been really helpful to me:  Some may seem<br/>
obvious, or maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FInd a friendly boxer in your area--they will happily tell you about the<br/>
accessibility fo the trails, status of the boxes etc.  I had one fellow<br/>
boxer who even went out and checked the boxes the day before I planned on<br/>
hunting them.  How helpful is that?? (Thank you Scoutdogs!!)<br/>
<br/>
Another adult is very helpful when you have a litle one.  My dh usually<br/>
watches the babe whielthe older two and I retreive the boxes.  Haven't lsot<br/>
her over a cliff yet, but it has been clsoe a few times, lol.  I also<br/>
invested in a Kelty backpack which is fantastic!  Much easier than a<br/>
stroller, especiallyif your 4yo will dig under the rocks for the boxes.   It<br/>
is also nice becasue I can send my hubby ahead iwth the fussy ones and<br/>
finish up the last box or two with the troopers (or jsut by myself)<br/>
<br/>
Keep trips short--I try to do one trail or two-three boxes per outing, then<br/>
reward with a visit to the playground or beach or whatever happens to be<br/>
featured at the park.  Ice Cream is also very motivating<br/>
<br/>
Water of ocurse.  Be careful about snacks however, becasue hte scent of food<br/>
can transfer from your hands to the box.  Same for baby wipes.<br/>
<br/>
Carry a spiderweb stick.<br/>
<br/>
My older two take turns retreiving and hiding the boxes.  They love<br/>
this--and are quite good at it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a personal stamp (again, thank you Scoutdogs) and a commercial stamp<br/>
for the two older children.  They also have their own log book.  My 6yo<br/>
records the name of each stamp as well.  I also take a picture or two of the<br/>
outing and scrapbook them in my logbook.  When the youngest is old enough to<br/>
ask for and use a stamp, she will get her own.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem has been scalign back to the interest level of a 4yo.  I<br/>
tend to get focused on collectign all the stmaps in one fell swoop and<br/>
forget to enjoy and relax.<br/>
<br/>
I envy the mouse-hunt!  If you ever pass through SW Ohio, we have quite a<br/>
few great boxes here<br/>

   When you go letterboxing as a family,<br/>
  does everyone have their own stamp, or do you have one family stamp?<br/>
