I found this link to an article in the Hartford Courant on a small <br/>
part of Westwoods staying open (maybe the white dot trail?).  <br/>

My family loves Westwoods.  Even though I only get there once or <br/>
twice per year now that I live in RI it is disappointing to know that <br/>
it will be unavailable.<br/>
<br/>
As for my LB, Dinosaurs before Dark, I will try and get there <br/>
Christmas week (if it's not too late) to recover it.  I had heard <br/>
that it needed its logbook replaced quite a while ago and have yet to <br/>
make it there.  That was the very first letterbox that I placed and <br/>
the site of my first date with my husband.  Sigh...<br/>

beautiful park, Westwoods itself could use a "good night's sleep" as <br/>
it has been quite heavily impacted by humans in the last couple years. <br/>
When the park finally re-opens, it will be renewed and all the better <br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, my father comes from a logging family, getting hit by a <br/>
falling tree is almost always fatal. The Land Trust sounded silly to <br/>
me by saying "no ones reported any near-misses." When you play with <br/>
fire....  I urge anyone still visiting Westwoods to stick to the open <br/>
trails to which every effort is being made to assure are safe.<br/>
