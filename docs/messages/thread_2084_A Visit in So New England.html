                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday we visited the Hezekiah's Knob box on Sleeping Giant. It <br/>
had a number of entries from non-letterboxers who had discovered the <br/>
box while sitting in the little sheltered area participating in <br/>
illicit recreation.  We also looked for the Right Knee, but there is <br/>
still a lot of snow up there (a foot or more deep in places) and we <br/>
were unsuccessful on that one. The orange trail is pretty much a <br/>
stream too--pondlike where it levels out.<br/>
<br/>
We've been dying to get outside and the predicted rain didn't happen, <br/>
so we had quite a nice day anyway.<br/>
