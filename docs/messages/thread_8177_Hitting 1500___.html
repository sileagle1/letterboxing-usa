<br/>
Just couldn't resist taking advantage of the fabulous fall weather <br/>
earlier this week to go on another little letterboxing spree! Just <br/>
realized it had been over 10 years since we'd last climbed a former <br/>
favorite of ours, Mt. Monadnock in southern NH, so that was the goal <br/>
of the day! Then, after a few more "outlying boxes" in the area, I <br/>
decided to scoot on over to VT, where legerdemaine's Toad became my <br/>
F#1500! What a hoot - felt like hitting the jackpot! (But then any <br/>
time I find ANY box - no matter what the quality of the stamp,logbook <br/>
or container, seems like hitting the jackpot to me!! :-)Thanks again <br/>
to all you wonderful planters!<br/>

<br/>Congratulations on your 1500th!! Boy do I have a long way to go. . .

<br/>I feel privileged just to have seen your stamps in a couple of the letterboxes I found last week on the East coast.

Wanda and Pete,<br/>
Bob and the Mighty Quinn accompanied me while I stamped in right <br/>
behind you four days later on the 5th.  Another beautiful fall day <br/>
for a hike on Mt. Monadnock.  I am so accustomed to seeing your <br/>
signature stamps in logbooks that I'm starting to have mixed feelings <br/>
of surprise and disappointment if they're not there.<br/>
<br/>
This past weekend Bob and I hit a few boxes in or near Mount Desert <br/>
Island making our F count 47.  Hoping to hit 50 by our one year <br/>
letterboxing anniversary of October 28th!<br/>
