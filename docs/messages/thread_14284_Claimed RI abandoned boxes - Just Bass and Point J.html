I have just entered Just Bass and Point Judith to my boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Mad Mary was not listed as a placer.  I thought I'd save you some <br/>
time and trouble by just putting them under my name.<br/>
<br/>
I am in contact with Mary by telephone, and when she has the time, <br/>
she can "fix" what I did.<br/>
<br/>
I did not want to have these boxes flutter off into cyberspace.  Both <br/>
are maintained, intact, and there as of last week.<br/>
