                    <div class="plaintext-content">To use a baseball analogy, Rogers Hornsby may have been the greatest pure hitter ever in major league baseball.  Between 1921 and 1925, his batting average was .397, .401, .384, .424, and .403, and he didn't mind telling you about it.  Late in his life, he was asked if his average would be as good against modern pitching.  He said, "Of course not, pitchers are much better today than they were when I played, but I think I could hit .275 or 280.  But," he said, "You gotta remember...I'm 67 years old!."  He was an old Texas boy, so he had a God-given right to brag, but I doubt he was bragging.  In Texas, we have a saying: If it's the truth, it ain't bragging."  You go, Wanda Woman!<br/>
