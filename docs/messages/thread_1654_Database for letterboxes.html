<br/>
As letterboxing grows here in North America, we've talked several <br/>
times about putting together a database program that people could use <br/>
to input their own new letterboxes. Right now our system works just <br/>
fine: people can post clues here on this mailing list and also put <br/>
them up on their own websites (like JayC just did with "The Rose" in <br/>
VA). We also put up "courtesy" pages on the LBNA webspace for folks <br/>
that don't have their own home pages. I anticipate that we can <br/>
continue this system for a long time. Still, being able to input <br/>
clues more directly might be an advantage.<br/>
<br/>
I, as one of your "webmasters," had started work on a user-friendly <br/>
database (you can see a non-functional preview at   <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/creator.htm  ), but I don't have the <br/>
expertise to make it work. Eric Mings, however, does know how to do <br/>
it, and has graciously offered in the past to put something up at his <br/>
own webspace. We've exchanged a couple of emails on the subject: <br/>
Eric, what do you think? And what do others think about the idea?<br/>

I hope you're all having a wonderful holiday season!  Jay, I've checked out<br/>
your non-functioning database entry form, and it seems fine to me.  The only<br/>
thing I might consider adding to it would be a special place for the date<br/>
the letterbox was planted.<br/>
<br/>
You know, another thought just came to mind.  How about a sort of "comment"<br/>
area?  A place where hunters could post reviews, etc.?  "Beautiful stamp,<br/>
but be careful of the poison ivy..." for example.  Just a thought, and it<br/>
might complicate things more than it's worth.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, everyone.  Happy hunting!<br/>
<br/>

I would be happy to put up a letterbox database on my site as have <br/>
mentioned several times in the past. To me the issue is whether it <br/>
will be used or not. If people want it, then I will do it. If it will <br/>
be largely ignored, then I don't want to spend the time that it would <br/>
take to do it right.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in participating in the planning and <br/>
development of such a project please write me directly. You don't <br/>
have to have any technical know how, I am more interested in getting <br/>
ideas for features people would like or not. I can most likely make <br/>
anything reasonable work from the technical end of things. If there <br/>
is enough interest I will put a small discussion list for those who <br/>
want talk about it as it is developed. I don't want to flood this <br/>
list with such an ongoing discussion. However, anyone would be <br/>
welcome to join the talk list if they were interested in being <br/>
involved.<br/>

I don't think we should have comments except in the log book. <br/>
I think only the person who placed the box should be able to add <br/>
content to the clue.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to read the comments, get outside, find the box, and<br/>
read the log book :-)<br/>
<br/>
