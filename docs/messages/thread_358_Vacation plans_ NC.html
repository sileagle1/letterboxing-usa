&gt;  Hey all. THis is my first day on this list. I am in NC, and travel<br/>
&gt;  somewhat in this state. Also have a son at the U.S. Naval Academy<br/>
&gt;  at Annapolis, and I drive there periodically. I'm wondering if<br/>
&gt;  there are any letterboxes to be FOUND in these areas, and was<br/>
&gt;  hoping to get some pointers about planting" some letter boxes as<br/>
&gt;  I travel...  Lynn Bensy, (alias Stamperhog, alias Hoggie)<br/>
<br/>
Hi Lynn, welcome.  There may actually, technically be a letterbox<br/>
in NC although it is listed under Tennesse.  Its called Max Patch<br/>
near Max Patch Mountain, NC I believe.  The clue can be found at<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/maxpatch.htm<br/>
This is in Western NC/Eastern TN.  This clue is a bit different as it<br/>
starts at another letterbox in Sewanee, TN.  That clue can be found at<br/>
http:http://www.pclink.com/elf/sewanee.htm  You will see that the clues<br/>
are linked together.  If you want to see an overview of all U.S.<br/>
letterboxes go to http://www.pclink.com/elf/<br/>
and scroll down to the maps, then on the right-hand U.S. map click on<br/>
Tennessee, there's one in MD also which isn't too far away.  I don't<br/>
know where you are travelling, but this map (by clicking on different<br/>
places) will reveal to you where the ones are that you may be getting<br/>
near to in your travels.<br/>
<br/>
As for how to plant boxes my recommendation is to get a good (well-<br/>
sealing) container.  If you want I will send a few to you for free.<br/>
Just send me your snail mail address to mailto:elf@pclink.com and<br/>
ask for some containers.  I also have one sample log book left.  The<br/>
log book is moisture proof.  If you are going to plant a box in a place<br/>
where you or somebody else may not be able to inspect it for a long<br/>
time I would highly recommend the moisture proof log book and a<br/>
container that seals well.  You will also need some stamps.  Many<br/>
people on this list (perhaps 1/2 to 2/3) carve their own stamps from<br/>
rubber erasers.  If you are interested in doing that just ask and<br/>
I'm sure somebody will give you some pointers.  I carved my own first<br/>
stamp just last week.  It consisted of 14 small letters.  It didn't<br/>
turn out exactly the way I would have liked but I'm very proud of it.<br/>
You can also have a stamp made from your own drawing or some clipart<br/>
and you can also purchase them ready made.<br/>
<br/>
Well there's lots more to know.  Ask questions.  Poeple are very<br/>
helpful.  Also, visit the Letterboxing USA site at<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf<br/>
and check out Getting Started and About.  That's where the clues are<br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck.  Don't be a stranger.<br/>

Thanks for the welcome. I have already helped myself to a tour of your<br/>
Letterboxing USA web page, and I DID see that one in Tenn.  I haven';t been<br/>
that far in that direction yet, since we just moved here in July. My travels<br/>
for work stay pretty much within 2 hours of center-state. However, my Harley<br/>
travels (when the weather changes), take me to other neat-o places. My mom<br/>
live in Myrtle Beach, SC. which seems like an EXCELLENT place for a letterbox,<br/>
to me. And NC is a big and beautiful state, with many rustic and relatively<br/>
undeveloped places to hide things. I would like to get to the point that we<br/>
could do a little "Harley ride" every month to plant a box.  We always need a<br/>
good excuse to go somewhere, and there are mountains, beaches, ANYTHING you<br/>
want here.  I'm thinkin' that state parks, national forests, etc are prolly<br/>
good targets, right?????<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to see your containers and weatherproof book, if you don;t mind. THe<br/>
stamps are NO PROBLEM, LOL.. In fact, THAT'S what got me interested. I am an<br/>
avid rubber stamperk and already have about 5000 stamps, so I can handle that<br/>
part, for sure. I plan to carve some and use some others that I have already.<br/>
The containers:   I had thought of the TUpperware kind, and my son has some<br/>
old ammo cans that we bought years ago..... wonder how THOSE would work????<br/>
In addition to the "stamp thing", I also am a fledgling bookbinder, and was<br/>
thinking of possibly making a tyvek book for stamping. Wonder how that might<br/>
work,..... ya know, that stuff is almost impossible to destroy. The US Postal<br/>
service gets a chance every day, and they STILL haven;t succeeded.<br/>
<br/>
I'm all ears, and ready to "plant" something. Waitin' for the weather to<br/>
change, and a little more info about choosing a place. And when this<br/>
"planting" is done, how does one go about getting the clues to the web page?<br/>
(I can already tell that the measuring, and the writing of the clues, etc,<br/>
will take WAAAAAY longer than the actual planting, OR the site choosing).  Has<br/>
anybody ever planted a box that no one was able to FIND by following the<br/>
clues?????? LOL<br/>
<br/>

Do you want to be on our welcome wagon list?  It shows<br/>
up at the end of this note.  I forgot to include in<br/>
my other note.  Also would you or Tammy be interested<br/>
in being NC delegates?  This just means you would be<br/>
on a separate email list that would be activated<br/>
when someone clicks on NC on the left-hand U.S. map.<br/>
In other words local people would be able to make<br/>
contact and stay in touch with you more easily.<br/>

<br/>
Well, I put my first one under a rock under some trees.  See the clues<br/>
at<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/mnmap.htm<br/>
or click on Minnesota and then Split Rock.<br/>
<br/>
You can be as sophisticated or as basic as you want.  I do believe it is<br/>
a bit more involved to use compass bearings and perhaps a little harder<br/>
to solve when they are used.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if a box has been planted that has stumped everybody.  I do<br/>
know that I was stumped by Rock Creek the first time, see<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/rockcrk.htm<br/>
I was standing right at the letterbox hiding spot but I did not look<br/>
down and under something in order to see it.<br/>
I was also completely stumped by Multnomah Falls, see<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/crgfalls.htm<br/>
mostly because I did not have my compass with me.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this information helps you.<br/>

Ps.  Hey, how about a Harley in Mitch's masthead design?<br/>
<br/>
Pps. My dad was trained under Harley And Davidson in Milwaukee<br/>
in the 40's.  He has a certificate signed by them.  He was in<br/>
one of the first classes to go through their training facility.<br/>
They actually taught the classes then!  My dad and my brother<br/>
Jim did not just work on Harleys, they also raced them - hill<br/>
climbs, flat-track and drag-racing.  Jim won the Nationals<br/>
at Gary, Indiana in 1965 on a 63 Harley Sportster.<br/>

Allow me to join in welcoming you to our group.  I had been talking to one of<br/>
my biker buddies recently about how much fun it would be to cruise around the<br/>
country on a Hog, planting letterboxes by day and carving stamps for them at<br/>
night.  I may yet have to take such action if we're going to realize our<br/>
letterboxing goal of "All 50 (states) by Y2K"!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Did you say 5000 stamps??!!!!   Look out, America, Der Mad Stamper is IN<br/>
LOVE!!!  What's the shortest route from Oregon to North Carolina?<br/>
<br/>
Tupperware and Rubbermaid sandwich boxes (especially the ones that are about<br/>
4"x 6") make excellent letterboxes.  They used to use ammo boxes a lot in<br/>
Dartmoor, but have been discouraging this lately, for fear that someone might<br/>
mistake a REAL misplaced ammo box for a letterbox.  Personally, I prefer that<br/>
letterboxes be in a container that is at least partially transparent, so it is<br/>
obvious what's inside.  It might be bad publicity if a bomb squad gets called<br/>
out to destroy what turns out to be one of our letterboxes!!!<br/>
<br/>
Many regards,<br/>
Mitch (a.k.a. Der Mad Stamper)<br/>

Hi Daniel,  At this time I'd rather not be an NC delegate.<br/>
Have too much going on now and not enough (i.e. zero) experience<br/>
in letterboxing.  Sometime in the future I'd like to consider<br/>
it - thanks!<br/>

Yeah to both these things.  I don;t know enough to be of much info to anyone<br/>
contacting me, but I'm gonna learn <g>, and you can see that I have big plans<br/>
to plant some stuff in my area. Hopefully Tammy and I can get some stuff<br/>
happening here........ after all, I can';t go find my OWN boxes, can I??? LOL<br/>
So put me on BOTH lists, and I'll do what I can.<br/>
<br/>
 Looking forward to getting your water-proof book to see what we need, and<br/>
maybe I can find some plain tyvek (as opposed to "liberating" some of those<br/>
Priority envelopes from the USPS as I have been doing) to make some of my own.<br/>
It stamps GREAT!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have already discussed this project with my SO (significant other) and he is<br/>
agreeable to the Harley adventures to plant the boxes. Sort of gives a PURPOSE<br/>
to each trip (yeah- like you need a REASON to ride a Harley on a beautiful<br/>
day, LOL). Will be getting my thought in order, and working on ideas for where<br/>
to plant the first NC box. Tammy...... you gonna beat me to that honor??????<br/>
LOL<br/>

4"x 6") make excellent letterboxes.  They used to use ammo boxes a lot in<br/>
Dartmoor, but have been discouraging this lately, for fear that someone might<br/>
mistake a REAL misplaced ammo box for a letterbox.  Personally, I prefer that<br/>
letterboxes be in a container that is at least partially transparent, so it is<br/>
obvious what's inside.  It might be bad publicity if a bomb squad gets called<br/>
out to destroy what turns out to be one of our letterboxes!!!<br/>
<br/>
Many regards,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How come every message I answer to the " individual" goes to the whole<br/>
GROUP????  I mean, I don;t have any secrets, but I figure you guys are getting<br/>
sick of seeing these messages from me by now. <br/>
<br/>
So anyhow, to Mitch:<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, baby!!!!!!  You and I think ALIKE about the fun to be had planting<br/>
letter boxes on Harley rides. In fact, (and this is just a thought here), you<br/>
MIGHT consider contacting HOG clubs in all 50 states, to see if they might be<br/>
willing to help with your project of planting boxes  in every state by Y2K. I<br/>
could picture a ride scheduled for just this purpose (you know, Harley folks<br/>
will ride for ANY excuse, and a get-together panned afterwards. And Harley<br/>
folks might be interested in HUNTING the boxes, too. THey already have some<br/>
Harley-sponsored program where you ride and take pix at various sites (like<br/>
the "welcome to.........." sign at the outside of almost every town) to prove<br/>
that you were there. This is similar, in the "stamping your book" aspect. So,<br/>
while I am sure Harley ITSELF would not be interested in sponsoring it,<br/>
various HOG groups might like to participate by planting and/or hunting boxes.<br/>
<br/>
As for the rubber stamps..... yep, I;ve got a SLEW of them. All subjects, that<br/>
I create "art" with. Flowers, motorcycles (of course), animals, etc. Not hand<br/>
carved, YET, but I do have plans. What is YOUR interest in rubber stamps?????<br/>
Do tell.<br/>
<br/>
Good point about the ammo box. I guess I WOULD be reluctant to open an ammo<br/>
box, if I found one, for fear of what I'd find it it. Thanks for the thump on<br/>
the head.<br/>
<br/>

I thought there was already a box in NC in the mountains... but<br/>
maybe someone else knows for sure.  I am being kind of slack<br/>
right now and don't think I can match your enthusiasm for getting<br/>
out a box right away!<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend in Greensboro, we do a lot of dog training<br/>
together (see that is the activity that takes up my time) and now<br/>
I already have a couple ideas of places to hide one or two in<br/>
that area!  Now that there is someone to go out and find them<br/>
that will be the next project I work on!<br/>

If you look at the header on the messages you should see that it lists the<br/>
person who wrote the message where it says FROM.  Below that, in the REPLY TO<br/>
space it lists letterbox-usa@egroups.com.  By default, all replies are sent to<br/>
the group.  If you want to send a private message, you'll have to copy the<br/>
address in the FROM space and drop it into the SEND TO box of your reply.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

My Dearest Hoggie,<br/>
You have some great ideas regarding getting bikers involved in the hobby.<br/>
Definitely worth persuing.  Right now, I'm wishing I had a bike.  I can hang<br/>
on tight, though!!  (hint, hint)<br/>

&gt;  ...What is YOUR interest in rubber stamps?????<br/>
&gt;  Do tell.<br/>
<br/>
Do to a rare birth defect, I was born with stamp pad ink in my veins, instead<br/>
of blood.  Fortunately it was red, so no one notices.  Actually, I have been<br/>
MAD about stamping for about fourteen years now.  It all started when I<br/>
stumbled upon a rare find at a used book sale: "The Rubber Stamp Album" by<br/>
Joni K. Miller and Lowry Thompson.<br/>
<br/>
Soon I was hooked... carving my own stamps, buying them from mail-order<br/>
catalogs, and finding them at flea markets.  I must say, I was well ahead of<br/>
my time... back then I could hardly find them in retail stores.  Now it seems<br/>
every craft, book, card, and toy store carries a nice line of stamps.<br/>
<br/>
I use them any way I can.  I love Mail Art.  My profusely decorated letters<br/>
have undoubtedly caused many a disgruntled postal employee to "lose it"!!  Who<br/>
knows how many ghosts haunt me as a result.  I am a public menace in more ways<br/>
than one... my stamps have been know to show up in the oddest public places,<br/>
from waiting room magazines to bulletin boards to (heaven forbid) restroom<br/>
walls.  On occasion I have even been known to protest certain products by<br/>
stamping activist messages on the boxes as they sat on the shelf in a store.<br/>
My name has been Der Mad Stamper for nearly a decade and a half, and I have<br/>
definetely lived up to it!!!<br/>
<br/>
I make maps with stamps, as well as cards, calendars, paperless wallpaper<br/>
designs, wrapping paper, and works of art (or MADsterpieces, as I prefer to<br/>
call them).<br/>
<br/>
Another fun activity that I enjoy is writing letters to people in the form of<br/>
a REBUS.  A rebus is a puzzle where many of the words in a message are<br/>
replaced with pictures.  Sometimes I use stamps with math symbols to create an<br/>
elaborate formula to define the words, for example, the word STAMPER might be<br/>
replaced with a formula that has a stamp of a STAR minus AR plus a stamped pic<br/>
of a LAMP minus L plus a stamp of a lady with the word "mom" (to represent the<br/>
word MOTHER) minus a picture of a MOTH.  Get it?<br/>
<br/>
To be quite honest, I had been so busy in very recent years that I seldom made<br/>
time for stamping, except on special occasions, like birthdays, valentines,<br/>
etc.  Then, I discovered the Smithsonian article about letterboxing in<br/>
(ironically enough) a waiting room.  I could almost hear the fuses blowing in<br/>
my head as I read the article!  I rushed home, logged on to the Net, typed the<br/>
word LETTERBOXING into a search engine, and before long found myself<br/>
conversing by email with Erik Davis in VT and Dan Servatius in MN.  A<br/>
letterboxing fanatic was born!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now that you know more about me than my MOTH plus ER, perhaps you will<br/>
consider marrying me.  I will clean all 5000 of your stamps regularly and<br/>
write love notes to you every day (if you can figure out what they say).<br/>
There's only one catch.  The prenups must state that if we should break up,<br/>
you get the cars, the bikes, the house and all the money... but I get all the<br/>
rubber stamps!!!<br/>
<br/>
Madly yours,<br/>

***** well, lots of them carry STAMPS, but not too many have GOOD ones. I Do<br/>
buy at stores, but mostly I order from catalogs. I have not yet started<br/>

****** I love mail art, too. I belong to a loosely knit group  of mail<br/>
artists, and we send "stuff" around the circuits. SOmetimes political,<br/>
sometimes just fun. SOmetimes it's art, sometimes it aren't.  Have been know<br/>
to send silly stuff, like a HUGE pair of women's underwear (not mine, thank<br/>
you) with a message on them, a stuffed globe which has been smooshed (with the<br/>
stamped message "This world is in terrible shape"). That project was an "add-<br/>
on amd forward" thing, and I have no idea where it went. One member created a<br/>
paper mache mummy, an add-on project also. After about 6 months, when it came<br/>
to me, my friend Octopussy8 and I "added on" the sarcophygus, which we<br/>
decorated with faux jewels and gold trip, which we stamped profusely with<br/>
Egyptian images. It was AWESOME, as was Ms. Mummy, by that time. Pretty kewl.<br/>
I have a pix of the mummy, if you would like to see. No pix of the sarcophygus<br/>
tho, sorry. (Maybe the "Puss" has one- will have to ask her).<br/>
<br/>
I make maps with stamps, as well as cards, calendars, paperless wallpaper<br/>

***** Let's trade snail addresses.  I wanna SEE some of this stuff!!!!  And<br/>
I'll send you some of mine, when I get back to it. Right now, I am over my<br/>
head in an on-going art journal swap round robin, and ALSO a nasty-naughty<br/>
card swap, to be followed by my stamped bio-pages and then a goddess design in<br/>
rubber (you get the drift- I have a lot on the stamping burner).  I MAY have<br/>
some of my stupid computer-art stuff left in the drawer, tho, and could send<br/>
you some of that. It's not anything amazing, but sort of neat. I have made<br/>
some faux postage stamps on the computer, too, and did a Bill and Monica<br/>
commemorative. I'lll see what I have to send in that lot.<br/>

(stamped) which will be mailed to a central brave person who will combine all<br/>
those bios into a nice hand-bound book. My page, Stampie, are done in<br/>
REBUS!!!! KEWL!!!!  I have used some scanned book-origin clip art, some<br/>
stamped and scanned (and reduced) art, some computer clip art, and a few other<br/>
things. It has been quite a challege to get it all together as I have no idea<br/>
how to combine text and picture (I THINK I don;t have the right software, and<br/>
I am a computer idiot, so don't EVEN try to tell me, thank you).<br/>
<br/>
To be quite honest, I had been so busy in very recent years that I seldom made<br/>

Stampie. Where were you 20 years ago...... (oh, never mind, you were probably<br/>
a baby, LOL.)<br/>
<br/>
My stamps are prolly worth MORE than all the above, tho, LOL.  They are like<br/>
drugs... once you start, you just can't STOP!!!!  But I'll share, for sure.<br/>
What sort of images do you like??????? I'll stamp you some images on sticker<br/>
paper and mail 'em to you.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to some mail art, both coming and going.<br/>

<br/>
I got the 2 containers today...... I wondered "What the hell is this?" when I<br/>
pulled them outta the mailbox, but since I am into mail art, I DO get some<br/>
weird stuff, so I wasn;t TOO shocked. I guess the BIG shock was that they were<br/>
WRAPPED, as opposed to mailed naked with an addess.<br/>
<br/>
I am amazed at the book...... sure LOOKS like paper........ tears like<br/>
paper.....wonder how it is so  weather-proof. Have you tested this stuff?????<br/>
Does it resist mold, etc???? How does it seem different from others, to<br/>
you????  <br/>
<br/>
I am planning to plant a box in a few weeks, as soon as I get my stamps carved<br/>
and scout out an ideal place for hiding. THink I will use one of your<br/>
containers.  Will let you know.... THanks for the education about this stuff.<br/>
