                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am not trying to stir anything up here but, it would seem that we are all making a multitude of assumptions about this class ~ that an uneducated, careless instructor is organizing this class and that there will be hordes of people tromping through the woods destroying existing letterboxes and the sport will never be the same.  Perhaps the instructor has created "dummy" boxes and people will go out in small groups after a great discussion of how to be a respectful boxer/cacher.  (Personally, knowing that people have pulled boxes unexpectedly in the past, I wouldn't count on a box being in place for my class unless I had created and planted it myself without telling anyone where it was!).  Perhaps we should wait until we know something.  You know what they say happens when you assume.......<br/>

P.S. I may be stretching it, but if we are sending "spies" into a class to make sure they are doing things the way we want, it feels a bit like what we detest the park folk doing as they monitor our web site.......  Would a friendlier angle be to get in touch with the instructor and, as excited, experienced boxers,  offer our help?<br/>

I tried using the earlier mentioned link to get to the info about <br/>
the Northfield Mt. class on Sunday but it wouldn't work for me.  I <br/>
found the info at www.nu.com/northfield/updates.asp<br/>
<br/>
This is what the website says (and I quote):<br/>
Introduction to Letterboxing and Geocaching<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, September 19; 1  4 pm<br/>
For ages 8 and older<br/>
Fee: $5 person<br/>
Pre-registration required<br/>
<br/>
Learn how to find small treasure boxes hidden in beautiful natural <br/>
areas. Both these activities involve visiting websites to get clues <br/>
to specific sites and using maps, written directions, or a global <br/>
positioning system (GPS) unit to navigate to boxes or caches. These <br/>
activities appeal to the treasure hunter instinct in everyone from <br/>
young families to adults. We'll spend time indoors learning how to <br/>
use the websites and the specific tools of each trade  notebooks <br/>
and handmade stamps for letterboxing, and the GPS for geocaching. <br/>
The group will then head out to find an example of each type of box. <br/>
Bring a notebook and water and wear sturdy shoes and woods clothes. <br/>
Program will involve some off-trail travel and a maximum distance of <br/>
a couple of miles on rolling terrain. No GPS unit required. Heavy <br/>
rain cancels. Program begins at Northfield Mountain.<br/>
<br/>
The jury is still out in my mind as to whether this is a good thing <br/>
or not.  As mentioned in my last post, I'm planning to go.  Ms <br/>
Dragonfli offered to go with me earlier and I hope she is stil up <br/>
for it!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
Kerri <br/>
<br/>
P.S.  It also said that heavy rain cancels.  So, this may all be for <br/>
naught any way.  (:<br/>

only using the term that was jokingly mentioned earlier.  I want to <br/>

speak up.  I'm really curious now and, to be honest, with my husband <br/>
away for a few weeks with the Navy doing disaster relief in the wake <br/>
of Hurrican Ivan, a trip to find far-flung letterboxes and learn more <br/>
about letterboxing's "evil twin", geocacheing.  Really, that's all.  <br/>
I'm looking at this more as an adventure than assuming the worst and <br/>
plowing in to take over.<br/>
<br/>
I think I'm done talking about this now....I'll let you all know how <br/>
it went.<br/>
