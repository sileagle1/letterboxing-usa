I'm sorry I wasn't able to get together with any boxers while I was there, but I enjoyed revisiting my old stomping grounds and finding/placing boxes there. I found Lonestar and Peanuts, both in good condition. I wish I had more time to find some of the others in the SA area, but other activies had to take precedence. <br/>
<br/>
I left behind three microboxes in McAllister park after enjoying lots of deer and even a family of armadillos up close! The clues for "Longhorns", "Dancers" &amp; "Cowboys" are posted on the Lbna site. Feel free to add them to any databases, but please let me know if you find them by sending me an email directly. Since I'm in Indiana, these boxes will need someone to 'adopt' them and care for them if any maintenance is needed.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
