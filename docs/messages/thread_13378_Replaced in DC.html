Was the Roosevelt Island box ever replaced or is it missing permanently (or <br/>
did anyone find it since last summer?)  I thought this might be another Drew <br/>
Clan box but I can't verify 'cause it no longer pulls up on the sight -- it <br/>
is listed but leads to an error page.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious -- it was our first box and our first failure  :-(<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to the Drew family for planting boxes in our neck of the woods!  BeMa<br/>
