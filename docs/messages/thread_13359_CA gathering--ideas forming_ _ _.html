It looks like we're going to need 2 gatherings though; one in the <br/>
San Francisco Bay Area (which I would coordinate along with Princess Lea who <br/>
has graciously offered to be on the planning committee) and one in the San <br/>
Luis Obispo area. <br/>
Considering the feedback we've all ready gotten, have a date in mind for the <br/>
Nor Cal Gathering: the weekend of September 6th?<br/>
<br/>
If we do decide on 2 gatherings, it would be best to have them different <br/>
weekends so those who desire could attend both. I'm thinking September 20th for <br/>
the So. Cal Gathering. (This is selfish on our part as we're planning to <br/>
celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary by traveling to SLO to letterbox!!)<br/>
<br/>
So, please respond with comments to the following questions:<br/>
Should we have 2 gatherings?<br/>
Does Sept 6th and Sept 20th work for you?<br/>
Any ideas for locations at either place? <br/>

Someday we should have a gathering closer to true Southern CA since, even<br/>
coming from downtown, SLO is a 200+ mile trip, far too long many of us in<br/>

As far as SLO goes,<br/>
<br/>
Sept 20th would eliminate JugglerMouse, myself, and Ash Raven, <br/>
probably not good for Emily Rose or Sade. Hmmm. Well, you could have <br/>
it here and we would see you (maybe) later in the day. I am bestman <br/>

For the SLO gathering, I think that it should be scheduled when Ryan <br/>

letterboxing for that area, and has planted many boxes there. If so, <br/>
then that gathering could be in October or later, unless Ryan starts <br/>

The vortex monster may have eaten my last post, so, I will try again.<br/>
<br/>
I think that there should be 2 gatherings, and maybe 3 if somone in <br/>
the LA area is interested organizing that one. For the Bay Area, all <br/>
of the parks in the East Bay area are wonderful places, and at <br/>
present any date will work. <br/>

For the SLO gathering, I feel that this gathering should be scheduled <br/>

I totally agree that we cannot do this without having Ryan there. So, <br/>
October? Should we check with Ryan to see what's good for him? Amanda (from Seattle)?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Should we have 2 gatherings?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Any ideas for locations at either place? <br/>

&gt; As far as SLO goes,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sept 20th would eliminate JugglerMouse, myself, and Ash Raven, <br/>
&gt; probably not good for Emily Rose or Sade. Hmmm. Well, you could <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; it here and we would see you (maybe) later in the day. I am bestman <br/>
&gt; at a wedding, JM, and AR would be with me there. Pandy will <br/>
probably <br/>
&gt; be relocated in Portland, Ore. by that time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any thoughts about Sept 27th? We would be happy to arrange things <br/>
&gt; here to help support that for then. Maybe get the local stamp store <br/>
&gt; to throw in some goodies, have a raffle, special plantings, <br/>
whatever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hopefully,<br/>

  &gt;San Luis Obispo area.<br/>
<br/>
  Someday we should have a gathering closer to true Southern CA since, even<br/>
  coming from downtown, SLO is a 200+ mile trip, far too long many of us in<br/>
  Los Angeles or the other cities for the next 200 miles south to San Diego.<br/>
