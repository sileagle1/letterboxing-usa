Hi All -<br/>
 We are going to Ogunquit ME at the end of this month and wonder if <br/>
anyone reccomends any specific letterboxes in that area?  I will <br/>
check the various clues at different websites, but wanted to know of <br/>
any particularly nice hikes/walks/senic view letterboxes. And I would <br/>
love to have someone go look for the Seaside Series I, in <br/>
Mattapoiset, MA, to let us know if it is still there.<br/>
 We have been letterboxing about a year, now, mostly in RI and nearby <br/>
MA. We started letterboxing via an aquaintence, who was beginning at <br/>
geocaching!  We are 'casual' letterboxers - we didn't carve our <br/>
stamps, we don't keep track of how many we have found ( tho they are <br/>
stamped in our logbook ), we haven't been to any gatherings, we don't <br/>
plan to plant any boxes. I read the message boards, more than post to <br/>
them. For us, it is mostly about the hiking and the discovery of new <br/>
places - we could not believe the waterfalls we discovered in New <br/>
Hampshire, while in pursuit of letterboxes!!<br/>
  We have introduced about 4 other couples and at least one single, <br/>
to letterboxing, just by discussing this hobby ( " What did you do <br/>
this weekend?" types of convos.)  It is our ferverent hope that those <br/>
people whom we have introduced to letterboxing will be respectful of <br/>
the land *and* the letterboxes. We like to bring along a trash bag <br/>
and carry out litter we find.  We don't hide what we are doing, but <br/>
we have never been asked what we are doing, while sitting on a <br/>
rock/log, stamping books and conversing. If asked, while searching <br/>
for a letterbox, we say " It's sort of a scavenger hunt " and wait <br/>
for people to continue hiking.<br/>
 We love doing this. It gets us out doing healthy things and <br/>
generally keeps us out of trouble.<br/>
