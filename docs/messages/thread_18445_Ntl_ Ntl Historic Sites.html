I don't know if Historic Sites are also banned--is the site run by the <br/>
National Park Service?   If so, then I think you're out of luck.   If it's run by <br/>
the Forest Service (or some other agency), then it might not be banned.   <br/>
Anyway, here are two suggestions for you to consider:<br/>
<br/>
1) Ask.   Find out who is in charge of the local site and explain our odd <br/>
hobby, tell where you would plant the box (of course, it will have to be <br/>
somewhere that would not cause probelms), and request permission.<br/>
<br/>
2) Consider starting the seekers at the fort and leading them via clues to <br/>
some other nearby location to find the box.   And/or the clues might include <br/>
info that is found by visiting the fort ("Count the cannons.   Take that same <br/>
number of steps from the old oak tree....)<br/>
<br/>
Hope you find a creative use for that stamp! <br/>
