This really takes the fun out of the wonderful hobby that we all<br/>
know and love to do. I will not mention any names but you know who<br/>
you are. And you sure are a group that makes it hard to enjoy<br/>
boxing. One from the group whom I thought prided oneself on<br/>
following the rules of the hunt and the game. One whom preaches the<br/>
criteria on the board quite frequently. I have been on the<br/>
letterboxing website lately to find some new boxes in my area to<br/>
hunt and low and behold was a new post today, maybe posted late<br/>
yesterday. The new box stated that it was placed on 7/1. A good<br/>
friend of the placer found it on 7/3. The post was put out on 7/5<br/>
or 7/6. Is this the fair way to be? How many Firsties can a person<br/>
want, or have, to get them this way? Everyone wants to be first now<br/>
and then. You might as well have just handed the person the firstie<br/>
prize. Shame on you both. I do not get it. What do you all<br/>
think? Is this the way to Letterbox? It is just so sad. Willow.<br/>

The ONLY time I do think it is fair is when the box is in honor or memory of another letterboxer or family member of another boxer.  For example: Butterfly et al put out a birthday box in my honor last year.  They gave me the clues first, so I could be the first one to stamp in, since it was a birthday box in my honor.  I think that is OK.  Sometimes, clues are originally not online and are meant to be shared, and then the placer decides to put them online.  Sometimes things change.  As for the situation you are referring.... I don't think it's fair.<br/>

I  obviously have no knowledge of the specific situation but did want to<br/>
share some thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I recently  placed my first boxes.  You will not find the clues on the LbNA<br/>
site--yet--because I want someone to double check on them, make sure they<br/>
make sense, are accurate, error free, etc. before  sharing them with the<br/>
world.  I am floating a test balloon, so to speak.   And when I do post<br/>
them, the clues will  say "Placed July 3"  and the first finders--who will<br/>
be friends of mine-- will have stamped in before  the clues are even posted<br/>
on the LbNA list.  (I did not include a "firstie" prize. most of the boxes<br/>
around here do not.)<br/>
<br/>
For me, this is a better option than finding I made some  significant error<br/>
in clue or placement.  Perhaps the case you encountered is similar.   I have<br/>
fond I enjoy the  hobby a lot more when I  focus on  how I box, instead of<br/>
how somebody else does.<br/>
<br/>
I like to be the first finder--especially if there is a bonus of some sort!<br/>
I like to beat some veteran boxers to  new boxes as well, and I especially<br/>
like to find a challenging or mystery box that has stymied others.  I like<br/>
to see my PFX count increase (tho I have no idea what it currently is) and I<br/>
like to progress towards my personal goals.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, I like to get outside and push myself physically and<br/>
mentally.  I love to find the box as it is a tangible proof that I met a<br/>
challenge, yet this is not nearly as important as it was when I first<br/>
started less than a year ago.<br/>

people did not have a chance to be the first finder of the box?  Are <br/>
you serious?<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is about getting outside and enjoying the trails and <br/>
figuring clues to hunt down letterboxes.  The prize is the enjoyment <br/>
you get from the activity -- mental challenge, physical workout, <br/>
time spent with family and friends, visiting a scenic or historic <br/>
place, an artistically crafted stamp and/or logbook...  Finding a <br/>
box at the end of the trail is nice, and I could understand a person <br/>
getting frustrated if they repeatedly came upon boxes that were <br/>
missing, but being a first finder -- hardly rates in the scope of <br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is a wonderful way to spend a few hours, a day or an <br/>
entire weekend, even if you are not first-finder at any of the boxes <br/>
you seek.  Truth be told, I would prefer NOT being the first finder -<br/>
- I like to see the stamps and read comments of other boxers who <br/>
have been there before me.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, who is to say what is fair and what is not fair?  To some, <br/>
word-of-mouth clues seem unfair, to others, store-bought stamps seem <br/>
an unfair reward for seeking a box, and for still others, it may <br/>
seem unfair to place a box at the end of a 10-mile hike up a large, <br/>
steep mountain, or on an island with no road or ferry access...<br/>
<br/>
Just find another box.<br/>

anyone would be so hung up about who was first.  Very interesting <br/>
indeed!<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry you feel this way, but please keep in mind that *most* <br/>
people do not plant letterboxes with the intention of turning it into <br/>
a competition for who finds the letterbox first.  I for one PREFER to <br/>
be the last of a long line of finders to see what other people have <br/>
stamped and written before me.<br/>
<br/>
The person who planted the box in question probably didn't plant it <br/>
with the intention of it being turned into a contest.  Why can't <br/>
looking for a letterbox be enjoyable in itself?  Is the second person <br/>
to find a letterbox somehow inferior to the first?  Is the third <br/>
person to find a box somehow inferior to the second?<br/>
<br/>
Unless the person publicly announced that there are no first-finders <br/>
when they posted the clue (a blatent lie), what would make you assume <br/>
the clue hasn't already been distributed through other means?<br/>
<br/>
Heck, maybe the first founder even found the box by accident.  I've <br/>
found letterboxes without publicly posted clues while searching for <br/>
some other nearby letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry you feel so upset about this, but I'll admit--I do have a <br/>
difficult time understanding why it would be so upsetting.  I <br/>
visualize a race where everyone is meandering along taking their time <br/>
and having a good time, except for one person running on out ahead <br/>
to 'scoop' the rest of the people (who didn't really care in the <br/>
first place), then being upset that they were scooped themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Does it really matter to people that much if they're the first finder <br/>
or not?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wouldn't let it bug you. I don't understand the emphasis on first<br/>
finder at all except in the instance of mystery boxes. Sure in a<br/>
mystery box there is some mental work to be done to find it and even<br/>
that ranges from ridiculously simple to ridiculously difficult. If I<br/>
find a mystery box and someone has stamped in before it was posted to<br/>
the list then clearly there was inside info and I'd still consider<br/>
myself the first finder. With ordinary boxes I say, "who cares". We<br/>
all have lives other than boxing and there are myriad reasons why one<br/>
cannot just dash out for a new box. I find the whole first finder<br/>
thing a ridiculous pretense in the case of most boxes and even so in<br/>
many mystery boxes. Even though you may solve a mystery clue you may<br/>
not be able to get to the box due to the demands of daily life or just<br/>
due to distance. Unless you can prove to me that you were the first to<br/>
solve a mystery clue then you have precious little to brag about with<br/>
your FF. If it's not a mystery box then I could care less if I'm the<br/>
FF or if you are. I don't even know what my current F count is let<br/>
alone my FF count. I just go get boxes when I want a distraction and<br/>
have some free time. I never had the slightest notion to include a<br/>
first finder prize in one of my boxes until it was mentioned here<br/>
recently nor did I know that I should have been counting these<br/>
separately. To be honest I'm rarely impressed by someone's F and<br/>
P-ness. Don't let them fill your head with silly competitive notions,<br/>
No one counts the same way and what does it all really mean anyway?<br/>
It's kind of like PLB's I don't get those either, so you put your name<br/>
on a list, big deal. I don't bother with virtual boxes either, I'd<br/>
rather go outside to do my looking so what's all the competition about<br/>
if half the people are only playing half the game? I get competitive<br/>
with a few local friends over a few things that interest us but in the<br/>
big game I don't much care what your count etc. is, never stopped me<br/>
from going out and getting a box and I don't think I'll get into<br/>
heaven any quicker because I'm an F500. It's all just playing.<br/>

The G-c'chers in my area make a big deal out of being First To Find.   To the <br/>
point of going out in the wee hours of the morning when an new c'che is <br/>
posted.<br/>
<br/>
I was first to find a couple of boxes in my area--not too difficult, since <br/>
there aren't a ton of boxers here, and I was emailing with the placer, so I knew <br/>
when the clues went up.   I'll admit to a kind of pleasure at being first, <br/>
but truthfully, I don't care if I'm ever first at another box again.   As others <br/>
have said, it's cooler to be able to review other people's comments and <br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
But we all want something slightly different out of the hobby.   Some don't <br/>
even care if the box is there at the end of the hike.   I'm not that evolved.   <br/>
If I go looking for a box, I MUCH prefer to find it! <g><br/>
<br/>
So to each his own, but you have to realize, what's important to you may not <br/>
be to the next guy.   It's possible the planter of the box in question never <br/>
even thought being first finder would be that crucial.<br/>

this box, however, is for others to enjoy the trail that I found personally <br/>
pleasing. I enjoy first finders as well, but I don't look for new postings to <br/>
try and get there first. I think the sad thing here is that the box  in <br/>

    Well, I mostly agree with you.  But I think I've seen a trend whereby folks, in talking about the neat stuff others leave as First Finder Prizes, may well have generated the thoughts that it's part of the challenge.  Heck, I can certainly think of folks who seem to do whatever it takes to be the first finder.<br/>
    Diane and I haven't gotten any First Finder goodies, and we've only found one box first.  It would be neat.  There may be regions where they leave all sorts of fun prizes for First Finders - I dunno.  And Willow may just have a lot of frustration after trying very hard.<br/>
    But actually, the letterboxing hobby is its own, fun, frustrating, lovely, challenging reward.  Don't let them get your spirit down, Willow!  As they say: "Get out there and box!"<br/>

    I don't know very much about what other letterboxers do.  I've <br/>
only found six and spend most of my time carving and planting them <br/>
instead.  There aren't a lot of boxes in my area.<br/>
<br/>
    I certainly have never felt an obligation to post clues to the <br/>
web first.  This has mostly been because the only people in my area <br/>
to hunt them were co-workers or friends that were new to <br/>
letterboxing.  I was trying to "win them over".  They were all into <br/>
it for "first to find" compitions.  None of them had stamps.  They <br/>
would just sign in with a pencil I included.  That's the sacrifice <br/>
that needed to be made in an area with no letterboxers.  Out of all <br/>
of them, only one person ever took the time to carve a stamp.  One of <br/>
them still hunts my boxes and signs in with pencil.<br/>
<br/>
    However, I am not working now to be home with my kids and the <br/>
only place to post a clue is on the web.  Still, I could see times <br/>
when I may not do that first.<br/>
<br/>
     As for "first to find" prizes, I put one in my boxes (or with my <br/>
boxes) about half of the time.  However, I have taken to not <br/>
mentioning when this is done or when a HH has been turned loose.  I <br/>
intentionally avoid it because it is better as a surprise.<br/>
<br/>
     I can understand your frustration if you felt like the "inside <br/>
line" was there to "cheat everyone else".  I can understand that you <br/>
may be more upset with someone's intentions than actually "not being <br/>
first".  But, it is really hard to say why things were done a certain <br/>
way without talking to the planter.<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks for bringing up this topic.  I think it has shed a lot of <br/>
light on what planters intend for their boxes and the hunters.  Hope <br/>
the comments have helped. :)<br/>

about being a "first finder". (It is not the norm for a box to have a "firstie" <br/>
prize hidden in it anyway.) To me it's no big deal at all whether I am the <br/>
first to stamp in or the 101st.<br/>
<br/>
Also, bear in mind that it isn't necessarily that someone is giving their <br/>
friends first dibs unfairly. I, for one, try to have someone "beta test" my clues <br/>
before I publicize them to the list. So for my boxes, there is ALWAYS someone <br/>
stamped into the box before I publicize them. In my opinion, it's more <br/>
important to have the box be findable and the clues understandable than to indulge <br/>
first finders.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>

I am new to this, having found my first box Monday June 5th. A friend and I are going on hunts and making our stamp together. The box we found was a bit challenging and when we found it, there was a little piece of paper saying we were the first. I must admit that being first seemed to make it a little sweeter, but we had no idea we would be. I have thought about it after reading these messages, and I don't have any need to be first, I'm just excited to find that there are some in my area (San Diego County CA). This is a relatively new sport and maybe it will evolve into a first finders game, maybe not. Anyway I am thrilled to be able to join you all. If anyone knows of any clues to boxes in Way Southern CA. let me know! (There are not too many on the Letterboxing web site).<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Michelle<br/>
PS the box we found was the 'Pacific Coast Trail' box of off Buckman Springs Road<br/>

  Gosh, all you people who love to be first, could you come to Utah and<br/>
  find some of our boxes.<br/>
  Traffic tends to be slow over here and I am so excited when I find a<br/>
  box that has lots of stamps for me to read. I love reading about the<br/>
  people who have gone before me, in fact I wish people would always<br/>
  remember to write where they came from cause I get such a kick out of it.<br/>
  But for all you who love to be first, I have taken to putting out a<br/>
  little scroll tied with a shrinky dink token that has a miniature copy<br/>
  of the letterbox stamp.<br/>
  Come to Utah and be first!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If I may, I'd like to chime in as well.  I recently posed a question <br/>
related to a couple of boxes I placed to the LBMA list.  A total of <br/>
two people were able to answer the riddle, so I provided them with <br/>
clues about 1 week prior to posting on the list.  These kind folks <br/>
were rewarded because they took the time to engage and answer the <br/>
question.  The rest of the LB world found out once after 1 week.  To <br/>
my respondent's credit, they were finders 1 and 2.  Good for them!<br/>
<br/>
Do I feel guilty or evil?  NO!  I was rewarding somebody whom I have <br/>
never met before or ever engaged in cyberspace before for answering a <br/>
riddle.  Would I do it again?  Yes.<br/>
