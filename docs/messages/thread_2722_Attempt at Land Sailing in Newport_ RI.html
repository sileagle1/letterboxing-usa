                    <html><body><p>I decided to leave work early on this glorious summer afternoon and take a Land Sail into Newport. This being the height of the tourist season I pulled out my nautical charts for the area and devised an alternate motoring route. I am familiar with the local waters and decided to wait and try the sailing route on a day less crowded with visitors. <br/><br/>I charted an alternate course and boarded my large water taxi (my husband had the nimble day sailer) and headed off to find the Drew Clan's mariner log. My only companion was <em><strong>Rhus Radicans</strong></em>, a novice traveler that I was anxious to be rid of.  <em>Rhus</em>' namesake has been plaguing all of my related efforts this summer and I was anxious to pass him off on someother unsuspecting navigator.  </p>
<p>I neared the final destination and left my large vessel behind, proceeding to the walls mentioned in the final directions.  On the way I paused, noting a large black "stretch" yacht idling at a mooring.  Once at the walls I realized that the only safe passage was blocked by a large wedding barge.  I slowly tacked back and forth as I waited for the captain of the vessel to perform his duties and move on.  Finally I descended to the docking slip.  I pulled out my trusty compass.  RATS!  My $4 compass had imploded!  (Next time I will have to spend at least $5 or $6 on a <u>good</u> one).  Should I run for a needle and a glass of water?  I didn't see any moss growing on the north side.  How was I to tell exactly where a heading of 240 was to find the hidden ship's log?!?!  </p>
<p>I was fairly certain that I could spot my final destination but was overcome by numerous pleasure craft slowly sailing through the area.  I decided to wait for another day and return when the recreational boaters were driven off by foul weather.  It was a day of mixed results.  I was still stuck with <em>Rhus Radicans</em> and  I was unable to reach my final goal but I did receive a celebratory glass of champagne for my efforts from the newlyweds.  As for <em>Rhus</em>, I am determined to lose him before the weekend is over...</p>
