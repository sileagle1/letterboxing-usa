&gt;What are some of the more interesting hiding places/or unusual twists to letterbox hunts?<br/>
Thanks<mimulus<br>
<br/>
<br/>
Our experience is several categories of locations:<br/>
<br/>
* scenic - waterfalls, overlooks, mountain peaks<br/>
<br/>
* historic - battlefields, homes of famous people, cemeteries<br/>
<br/>
* commercial - stamp stores, ice cream stands, book stores<br/>
<br/>
* municipal - libraries, town parks, sport fields, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Mimulus: We've heard from Deanne and Dave how wonderful your boxes are. Hope this helps to get more gems out there!<br/>

Two or Three part boxes.something like go to point A to get more info.<br/>
At point A you get further instructions to point B. At point B you get<br/>
instructions to the box at point C.and then at point C (the box) throw<br/>

These are really fun boxes, both to create and to find, but a word <br/>
of advice if you are thinking about creating a linear series like <br/>
this -- place it close to home.<br/>
<br/>
Since the chain is broken if one of the boxes goes missing, you will <br/>
probably find yourself checking up on this one more often than a <br/>
typical, stand-alone box to avoid people being disappointed by a <br/>
missing link.<br/>

SpringChick is right on with this advice. We did an 8 box series <br/>
called Stamp Golf that had 8 pieces of the stamp hidden in the mini <br/>
boxes, and the # 3 and #5 kept going missing. The distances were set <br/>
up in various measurements, such as cubits, rods, meters,spans, and <br/>
hands. Only one letterboxer was able to complete it. We finally pulled <br/>
it after the pieces went missing for the third time.<br/>

Would any of these boxes be in Indiana? We are going to visit my mom this  <br/>
summer and the one event we are planning is to go to see some covered bridges.  <br/>
Mom said we will have to take a day trip and go south.<br/>
