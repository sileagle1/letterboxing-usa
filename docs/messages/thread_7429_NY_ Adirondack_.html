&gt; Subject: NY: Adirondack<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A.D.<br/>
&gt; In an effort to recover from my obvious faux pas, I am afraid we would be<br/>
&gt; carried away by those pesky BLACK FLIES if we were to venture into the<br/>
&gt; mountains in April. Oh! How fun it would be to meet somewhere near Tupper Lake<br/>
&gt; or Lake Placid in the High Peaks area though. We really should look at this<br/>
&gt; idea seriously.<br/>
&gt; For a Spring gathering we would have to add to the meet announcement, "Please<br/>
&gt; Bring a Dish to Pass, a Gallon of DEET and Several Yards of Mosquito Netting<br/>
&gt; Per Person."   Feeble attempts at humor aside, the Dacks do BEG for more<br/>
&gt; letterboxes. There are so many extraordinary places there that remain<br/>
&gt; undiscovered. Maybe Fall is better.<br/>
&gt; All in all...great idea the Dacks proper are, A.D. Maybe soon, someone who<br/>
&gt; lives in the thick of the High Peaks will turn up on the list who would be<br/>
&gt; willing to push this gathering along. Until then, maybe the Albany area venue<br/>
&gt; (not right IN Albany) would work. Lake Champlain, Lake George, Saratoga areas<br/>
&gt; must have some interesting areas? Certainly lots of places to stay camp or<br/>
&gt; stay. If the day is clear, maybe we could at least see the mountains from<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>

&gt; would know that any gathering of them would have to<br/>
&gt; occur in the mountains and not amongst the flat lands!<br/>
&gt; ;o)  What better way to get more people to plant boxes<br/>
&gt; in this achingly letterbox-barren place?  Nay, Albany<br/>
&gt; just won't do for someone from the 'Dacks. lol<br/>

&gt;&gt; You would probably draw many boxers from CT/RI/MA/VT<br/>
&gt;&gt; and beyond as well as New Yorkers. However, there<br/>
&gt;&gt; are a couple of gatherings in Southern N.E. already<br/>
&gt;&gt; on the books for October. Perhaps a nice spring<br/>
&gt;&gt; kickoff in mid to late April (sans one of those late<br/>
&gt;&gt; Nor'easters) would be a welcome respite from the<br/>
&gt;&gt; Northeast's late winter doldrums? All of upstate New<br/>
&gt;&gt; York is fertile ground for letterboxing with its<br/>
&gt;&gt; lovely parks and trails. The Albany area would be<br/>
&gt;&gt; perfect. Just a thought.<br/>

Is anyone out there a member of the Adirondack Mountain Club? I know it is a very active group with various environmental, recreational and political agendas. Maybe we need to hook up with them in some way and get the word out? For those of us in New England, even though we have lots of places to hide and find, the possibilities in the Dacks are mind-boggling. What say you all?
