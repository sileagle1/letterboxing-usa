just outside of Mansfield. I am loosing my mind. I need to go boxing but<br/>
between the little ones having colds and all this snow I have had VERY<br/>
little time for boxing. Long sad sigh!<br/>
Hopefully this weekend will be nice and clear.<br/>

&gt; Hi People in Connecticut (and everywhere else too)<br/>
&gt; We were boxing in RI this past weekend and there wasn't very much snow<br/>
&gt; We were thinking of going to Mansfield, CT this weekend (is that<br/>
&gt; where the Got Milk box is???).  How much snow did you guys get?<br/>
