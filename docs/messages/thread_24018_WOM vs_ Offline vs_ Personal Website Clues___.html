                    <div class="plaintext-content">I happened to pop into one of the regional lists and was surprised <br/>
at a thread there.  I think that there is some confusion <br/>
between "WOM" clues, "offline" clues and then clues that are online, <br/>
just not on one of the two main clue sites.<br/>
<br/>
A true WOM clue is one that is not found online and is not available <br/>
to the general public.  It is typically distributed on a very <br/>
limited basis by the planter to persons of his choosing based on <br/>
criteria of his choosing.  "Offline" clues are those that are not <br/>
listed electronically on any web site, rather they are distributed <br/>
via e-mail, US mail, a clue booklet or some other innovative means.  <br/>
In general offline clues are available to anyone who requests them <br/>
from the planter.  Then there are clues that are listed on the web, <br/>
just not at one of the major clue sites (LbNA or AQ), rather they <br/>
may be at the planter's own website or a regional group, etc.  These <br/>
too are generally accessible to anyone who looks for them.<br/>
<br/>
A person who chooses to list their clues only on their own [public] <br/>
website (aka Mosey) or a person who makes their clues available in <br/>
an offline format such as a clue booklet (aka Phyto) is not <br/>
necessarily taking the same route as somebody whose box clues are <br/>
distributed only via WOM.  In both of the situations mentioned here, <br/>
the clues are not limited to only a select few or just the friends <br/>
of the specific letterboxer, they are available to anyone who makes <br/>
the effort to seek them out.  When a person whose clues are <br/>
distributed in an alternate manner such as this makes a public <br/>
comment about their clues, it is not to say "ha-ha I have a clue and <br/>
you can't have it," rather it is more along the lines of "I have <br/>
some clues and it is up to you to find them."  This is very <br/>
different than taunting that you have a WOM clue but are only going <br/>
to give it to a few people of your choosing.<br/>
<br/>
Just because LbNA and AQ are out there are available for everyone to <br/>
use for clues does not mean clues must be posted there or that it is <br/>
the only viable way to distribute clues.  What's wrong with being <br/>
creative, having a little fun with the way you distribute your clues?<br/>
<br/>
So before you label these folks who are trying out alternate ways of <br/>
clue distribution as exclusionary or curmudgeons, take a minute to <br/>
read what it is they are actually saying rather than jumping to <br/>
conclusions and criticizing them based on your perceived ideas and <br/>
stereotypes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the detailed explanation. There is always something new to learn it seems.<br/>
<br/>
I recently took a leap into the unknown by looking for mystery boxes. They were listed on <br/>
lbna.org, but the clues were not. There was a question on there that you had to research <br/>
and answer. The questions weren't hard [well, not for me anyway - and there is always <br/>
google] but they were not always answerable with a single word [I did have to write a short <br/>
explanatory essay on at least one]. Then I emailed the answers to the placer with a request <br/>
for clues. Then I got the clues, but they were still to mystery boxes, so no city or town to <br/>
start. Just a county, which was good enough. So then I still had to figure out where in the <br/>
county to start. <br/>
<br/>
A couple were easy and I found those...one I found the spot but not the box itself... and 2 I <br/>
still cannot figure out where to start.<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, the 2 I found had boxes and baggies full of water. One of them, the logbook itself <br/>
was completely ruined. The other, the log wasn't quite ruined but the wet had caused the <br/>
inks to run.<br/>
