new bags and book.  While I was in the area I went to the Trustom Pond <br/>
Wildlife Refuge.  What a beautiful place!  Unfortunately when I went to the <br/>
first observation deck I found some unnatural square stumps and copious <br/>
amounts of sawdust along with some newish looking benches...  I was a bit <br/>
worried that I would find, or rather not find, the second observation deck in <br/>
the same state...  No one was in the hut for me to confirm the removal of the <br/>
deck and perhaps even the box (I imagine that this is quite likely since I <br/>
did find a perfect flat rock tossed to the side.  No, no box underneath!)  <br/>
What was most disappointing was when I found the second stamp and realized <br/>
that the picture would not be complete without the first one!  At least I was <br/>
appeased with the stunning view.  <br/>
