<br/>
Took the Bunch out and went hunting for boxes yesterday, all day. We spent <br/>
several hours over the previous week looking up information and planning our <br/>
strategy for the biggest success. Canton, GA has 10 letterboxes that we were <br/>
immediately interested in collecting that day. We gave up after trying for nine of <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Here's our journal:<br/>
**Old L&amp;N Railroad Depot - Alive and well.<br/>
**Barnett Park - Not found. This box was placed in July of '02, and a housing <br/>
development has moved in since then. It may be lost, we think.<br/>
**Woodland Meadows - Alive and well. Loved this spot.<br/>
**Etowah Chief - Found a chewed up baggie and logbook nearby, and nearly had <br/>
our hearts broken digging in the rotten leaves to rescue the stamp. Then we <br/>
found the actual box nearby. Alive and well.<br/>
**Possum Hollow - Not found. Oddly enough, we found the Bogie hitchhiker <br/>
here, with a stamp in its logbook for Possum Hollow, right where this box was <br/>
supposed to be. But Possum Hollow box was nowhere in sight. We placed a new <br/>
logbook and container here, but someone will have to replace the stamp. <br/>
**Coon Creek - Alive and well.<br/>
**Sherlock Holmes Series - All 3 stamps alive and well. Logged in the last <br/>
one just after sunset, and came back to the car in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
We have had a blast since we began letterboxing over new years weekend. We'd <br/>
like to encourage anyone living in or visiting Georgia to visit our recently <br/>
planted boxes at Panthur Creak and Hemlock Falls.<br/>
<br/>
See ya on the trails!<br/>
