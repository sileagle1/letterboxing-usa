<br/>
The political excitement continues! <br/>
<br/>
President Bush has not only posted to this talk list last night but <br/>
has just sent us his image as a challenge to John Kerry  - to <br/>
determine who is the better carver - and thus - more equipped to run <br/>
the Letterboxing States of America.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING: Please - this image is not for the political faint-of-heart <br/>
or those that do not like parody at it's finest!<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of you boxers: y'all mosie on down to our website and <br/>
get a gander at the carving prowess of this nation's First Carver!<br/>
<br/>
And - as always - <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DON'T FORGET TO HAVE FUN and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
<br/>

Great carving Mark!  Obviously the prez has a trained hand and wonderful<br/>
perspective of himself...  Do we have a PFX count on either candidate??  <br/>
