SENECA  CREEK  TRAIL  LETTERBOX<br/>
<br/>
Established: Sept. 21, 2002<br/>
<br/>
Location:<br/>
The Seneca Creek Trail letterbox is located in Montgomery County, MD.<br/>
<br/>
Nearest Town:  Darnestown<br/>
<br/>
Parking:  Park at Black Rock Mill located on Black Rock Road between Rt. 118<br/>
and Rt. 28 where the road crosses Seneca Creek.<br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
The Seneca Creek Trail runs upstream and down<br/>
To determine the way, the first clue is found<br/>
By using your head and solving this cipher,<br/>
Then hitting the trail, like a seasoned hiker.<br/>
<br/>
23 23 23 . 19 5 14 5 3 1 20 18 1 9 12 . 15 18 7 / 12 9 14 11 19 . 8 20 13<br/>
<br/>
I hope you like hiking, there's a mile to go<br/>
So tighten you boots and enjoy nature's show.<br/>
<br/>
Finally you've made it to the house of the troll<br/>
It's the 5th one, if you've been keeping a toll.<br/>
You must pass the troll, of that there's no question<br/>
Say, if he eats you he'll get indigestion.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you liked hiking when you started the day.<br/>
So onward you go, it's too late to say nay.<br/>
Climb up the steep hill, you'll huff and you'll puff<br/>
Till you stand on the top.  Have you had enough?<br/>
<br/>
Now look for the ring, it's not far from the trail<br/>
Or if you're too tired, why sit on your tail.<br/>
The ring is found by taking fifteen paces<br/>
Find the heading on the decimal bases<br/>
<br/>
The length of the troll's home multiplied by 10<br/>
Then perform a subtraction of 10 again.<br/>
