welcome, flames to /dev/null!<br/>
And with that, here's something that caught my eye the other day:<br/>
<br/>
Let's see if I understand how America works lately ...<br/>
<br/>
If a woman burns her thighs on the hot coffee she was holding in her lap while driving,she blames the restaurant.<br/>
If your teen-age son kills himself, you blame the rock 'n' roll music or musician he liked.<br/>
If you smoke three packs a day for 40 years and die of lung cancer, your family blames the tobacco company.<br/>
If your daughter gets pregnant by the football captain you blame the school for poor sex education.<br/>
If your neighbor crashes into a tree while driving home drunk, you blame the bartender.<br/>
If your cousin gets AIDS because the needle he used to shoot up with heroin was dirty, you blame the government for not providing<br/>
clean ones.<br/>
If your grandchildren are brats without manners, you blame television.<br/>
If your friend is shot by a deranged madman, you blame the gun manufacturer.<br/>
And if a crazed person breaks into the cockpit and tries to kill the pilots at 35,000 feet, and the passengers kill him instead the<br/>
mother of the deceased blames the airline.<br/>
<br/>
I must have lived too long to understand the world as it is anymore. So if I die while my butt is parked in front of this computer,<br/>
I want you to blame Bill Gates..<br/>
OK?<br/>
