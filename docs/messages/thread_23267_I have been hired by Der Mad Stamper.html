                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Dear Letterboxers of North America, <br/>
<br/>
One of your members, known by the name of Der Mad Stamper, has employed my services to solve what he claims to be a "most atrocious crime". One of your members has confiscated what he calls "a valuable commodity", white PZKut, belonging to this individual. My client, Der Mad Stamper, has offered a large reward in the apprehension of this devious crook. <br/>
<br/>
Der Mad Stamper has informed me that you are a close-knit community and would be of much assistance in my investigation. Having no understanding of your hobby I am not quite sure what the big deal is over an item called PZKut. However, I have been hired to solve the crime, and solve I will. I will search the whole continent to discover who and why this senseless act has perpetrated upon my client. <br/>
<br/>
The only name I have discovered thus far in the course of my investigation is that of a Don &amp; Gwen. The last name does not seem to be available to me. Does anyone have knowledge of these individuals and who they might be? Rumor has it that Don has a history of run-ins with others. Have you any knowledge of a past history of wicked deeds by this so called duo? <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon <br/>

<br/>
I plead 'NOT GUILTY!!!!'<br/>
<br/>
We have an iron clad alibi. Just check your facts Mr. Bacon. <br/>
The 'Whats New' section has us in the clear.<br/>
Boy what a great bunch we have here, everyone jumps on the bandwagon <br/>
and starts throwing accusations my way.<br/>
History of run-ins indeed!<br/>
I'm a pussycat and my history is free from MOST of your so <br/>
called 'wicked deeds'.<br/>
This is just wonderful. We get back from a great little letterboxing <br/>
trip, and the first thing I see this morning is our name being <br/>
sullied on this list.<br/>
The most hurtful was the reference to the 'Groover' story, which I <br/>
might add, put me in the Rafting Hall of Infamy. The nuance was <br/>
clear for all that know the story--"Don is full of S-it". I won't <br/>
take these references lightly, nor will I stand by and be accused of <br/>
stealing Der Mad Stamper's PZKut. While the white stuff is what I <br/>
enjoy using, I would never steal 'all' of another carvers supply. <br/>
While I might have motive, the time and opportunity is lacking. Go <br/>
crawl into some other corner Mr. Bacon and find your perp. If it is <br/>
proof you need I can furnish a complete 'Found' and 'Planted' report <br/>
from San Diego for the time of the theft.<br/>
<br/>
For the rest of you----SHAME on you!!!!! Just remember the guilty is <br/>
among you and your kind.<br/>
<br/>
