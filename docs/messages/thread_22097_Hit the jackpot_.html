                    <div class="plaintext-content">Though new to this list, I'm not a newbie.  I've been following the<br/>
recent threads on this list via another letterboxer's computer. <br/>
Hopefully, the recent wars are over and everyone can get back to what<br/>
matters.....boxes....right?<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the other day, while melting and doing some boxes in the 90<br/>
degree heat,  I happened upon some other people in the woods.  This<br/>
was the first time I had run into other boxers in the woods.  <br/>
<br/>
Here's the amazing part:  They were Funhog, Mark and Sue Pepe, and<br/>
Jenn from Jenn and Silent Doug.  What are the chances of running into<br/>
these heavy hitters?  Moreover, they were all together.  Probably<br/>
should have bought a lottery ticket, but didn't think of it.  What<br/>
amazing people they are.  Funhog's from Origyn, (this is how it should<br/>
be spelled) right?  How lucky to be around the same time she was.  And<br/>
Mark and Sue....awesome.  We even went out for pizza afterwards where<br/>
we met with JAY DREW and some other old-schoolers...can you even stand<br/>
it?  Holy Cow!! <br/>
<br/>
Look, is it possible to wipe the slate clean and maybe pretend last<br/>
week didn't happen?  It shouldn't be too hard.  It was a dark time and<br/>
hopefully, it is forgetable.<br/>
<br/>
We're all abunch of crazies running through the woods looking lost and<br/>
 flipping over rocks.  Normal people would think we're maniacs.  <br/>
<br/>
That's what I'm counting on.  The fact that we are different and<br/>
willing t forgive and forget and not carry grudges.  It's too much<br/>
work to stay mad, don't you think?<br/>
<br/>
Let's all be friends again and put our differences aside.  REMEMBER,<br/>
WE'RE ALL A BUNCH OF LOONIES WHO LOOK FOR TUPPERWARE.  Do we need<br/>
anymore madness, besides this insane addiction?  I've got no room left<br/>
for any "extra" craziness.  I'm dealing with enough just finding and<br/>
planting boxes.  Is there rehab for box adicts.  And does Blue Cross<br/>
cover the treatment?<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
Go Yanks <br/>
