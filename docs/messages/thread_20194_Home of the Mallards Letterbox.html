check on it, (3 weeks).  Christmas Elves notified us of a possible <br/>
problem and they were correct.  We had heard that Madison has <br/>
a 'reputation' for lost or vandalized boxes but we wanted to try <br/>
anyway...It would have been a fun one to find, we think.  3 <br/>
stamps...2 silly cats and a mouse hitchhiker.  Oh well....we are not <br/>
discouraged. At least I am not discouraged...but my hubby is a MAD <br/>
Cat!  We will try again but not in Madison.  Let us know of any <br/>
thoughts about Madison WI as a location to place boxes.  Thanks, <br/>
MADCATS <br/>
