We had hoped to arrange to pack up tonight and be reay to roll  tomorrow after work, but it has been pouring torrents of rain here. I think we'll be arriving pretty late and setting up in the dark.  I hope it isn't raining to boot.  Anyway, if we don't come looking for you, please feel free to check in on us.  We have a brand new tent that we have never set up before, so it could be a real comedy.  <br/>

P.S. TGD, loved solving Strix Varia<br/>
