  Jerry's Artarama (in West Hartford CT) carries all different sizes and thickness of MasterCarve.  <jerrysartarama com="" dot="">  If you're not closeby, you can request a catalog from their website.  Also, JoAnn's ETC. carries at least one size.  Good Luck! MayEVe<br/>

Does anyone know of any craft stores that carry Staedtler carving<br/>
blocks?  I can only find them online and most places I've found I'd be<br/>
spending more on shipping then my actual purchase. Thanks for any ideas<br/>
where to purchase in an actual store. PeaKay<br/>

===================================<br/>
<br/>
You don't say where you're located but if you have any<br/>
colleges/universities/community colleges in your area, check out where the<br/>
art students buy their art supplies.  Here in northeastern IL, I buy mine<br/>
from Carlson's Art Supply -- they have a store in Wheaton and a store in<br/>
Lombard.  And their price isn't bad for Mastercarve.  They run sales on<br/>
Mastercarve every so often and I stock up then.<br/>
