of my boxes in the area: The Golden Eagle at Smith Rock, the Crooked<br/>
River Bridge and the Waterfowl Highway. All are just fine, thank you,<br/>
but the last box is still awaiting its first stamp. The other two have<br/>
both been graced with visitors, some from as far away as Indiana!<br/>
Those folks wrote in one of the logs that that they had also visited<br/>
three of the boxes on Crooked River Ranch, and out of the way<br/>
destination to be sure!<br/>
<br/>
Spring is just beginning on Oregon's high desert and my favorite<br/>
harbingers of spring are back: the lovey Turkey Vulture! It's a<br/>
perfect time for a cool hike in the sagebrush and juniper. Funhog<br/>
