Difficulty: Easy Terrain (once a little research is done)<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox has come to rest in peace far from its namesake's home in<br/>
Cork. Located now somewhere in SE Wisconsin, this box is placed in a small,<br/>
but saintly area in the county of "yellow earth." To find this buried<br/>
treasure you must find out who, born about 560, founded a famous monastery<br/>
in his Celtic homeland, but chose to live out his final years as a hermit in<br/>
Gougane Barra. (Hint: Once this name has been secured you must lose the<br/>
second r). It will not be necessary to travel to Rome to complete your final<br/>
pilgrimage, however. Instead travel near the small community known as<br/>
Wisconsin's crossroads. Once you've reached this sacred ground, ascend the<br/>
12 stone steps, walk north past William and Rose, follow the fence to the<br/>
four trunked birch and claim your heavenly reward.<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to contact us with your solution before setting out on your<br/>
journey if you need verification. Have fun!...<br/>
