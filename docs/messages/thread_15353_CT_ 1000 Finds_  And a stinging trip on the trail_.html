                    <div class="plaintext-content">I set out to Mansfield this morning, determined to get my 1000th find before <br/>
school starts (school starts tomorrow... ugh!!!).  I arrived at Schoolhouse <br/>
Brook Park ready to find a myriad of boxes which I have not yet found.  I got <br/>
out of the car and took the Roadrunner out to the Nipmuck, ready to grab Paw <br/>
Print when I felt a bug in my hair.  I stopped and felt around in my hair and <br/>
pulled out a bug, to find that it was a yellow jacket!  I threw it on the ground <br/>
and started walking again.  Not five paces later, I felt a bug in my hair <br/>
again only to find another yellow jacket in my hair!  This one decided to sting me <br/>
on the top of my head before letting me free it from my hair!  With throbbing <br/>
in my head (and a stinger still attached to my head), I went along to grab <br/>
Paw Print.<br/>
<br/>
Since that was the only box I was prepared to get on the north side of the <br/>
road, I went back to my car, head still throbbing.  I called up Leader of the <br/>
Pack on my cell, hoping that she was out of bed at 8:25 a.m. (which she was), <br/>
apologized for calling so early, told her what had happened and asked if she <br/>
would pull a yellow jacket stinger out of my head.  Bless her heart that she said <br/>
YES, so I wouldn't have to go back to my doctor all the way back in <br/>
Manchester, which would have suspended my boxing today.  I drove up to her house, where <br/>
she was already prepared with tweezers, magnifying glass and bee sting <br/>
ointment in hand!  Once she got the stinger out, the throbbing lessened, and we had <br/>
a very nice chat.  As a Thank You, I let her sign into the hitchhiker I had.  <br/>
Thank you SO MUCH LEADER OF THE PACK!!!!  What great friends I have in <br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
I then ventured back to Schoolhouse Brook Park to find the Elephant South <br/>
series, and Sasquatch.  No bee stings this time!  Then went out to do I've Got <br/>
Rhythm, which I must not have a lot of, since I couldn't find box #2 (funny how <br/>
the music teacher doesn't have much rhythm???).  Though My Favorite Actor <br/>
series was just down the street, I felt that I didn't have enough stamina to go up <br/>
the hill required and decided to go to Merrow Park instead to get the ones I <br/>
didn't not have.  I found Last Day, Circle of Life Series, and Friendly Skies <br/>
all intact, which brought me to 998.  So where to go for the last two???????  <br/>
I decided to hit two quickies in Coventry.  BTW.....  if you are the next <br/>
visitor to the box that made my 1000th box, you will get an extra special treat!<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a great "last hurrah" before school starts!!!!  Have a great <br/>
school year!<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>
