<br/>
I am very sorry to understand that Dartmoorans are, if I uunderstand it<br/>
correctly, aggressively and wontingly ostracizing Adrian for spreading<br/>
Letterboxing to the US.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than react with negativism towards Adrian, I challenge any other<br/>
British letterboxer to join in this discussion with letterbox-advocates<br/>
here in the US.<br/>
<br/>
What exactly is the issue?<br/>
*****<br/>
Does someone over there feel we are trying to 'control' a longstanding<br/>
British tradition? <br/>
<br/>
        I'd suggest that we are not. Yes, we are eager enthusiasts, we<br/>
are<br/>
using the internet to try to build interest and 'critical mass' over a<br/>
large geographic area, and perhaps we are exploring varying ways to<br/>
incorporate the widest possible participancy. But, we, the<br/>
"Letterboxing-USA" folks at least, make no wider claim, save to look to<br/>
Dartmoor with a sort of "letterboxing reverence" and respect, for many<br/>
aspects of the hobby. We certinly amke no claim to be the 'headquarters'<br/>
for letterboxing worldwide.<br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Does someone feel that we'll create hoards of locust-like 'Ugly<br/>
American' letterboxers, combing through the moors, trampelling the gorse<br/>
and angering the sheep owners? <br/>
        I'd suggest not. First, if you are worried, share your clues<br/>
amongst<br/>
yourselves and shut the rest out. That would be sad but effective.<br/>
         But really, letterboxing does not sink to the dumbed-down level<br/>
of<br/>
casualness and immediacy that the masses in our country usually demand<br/>
for entertainment. We invented (ugh), MacDonalds and Burger King, our<br/>
Disney (ugh) has homogenized entertainment and resold it thru the<br/>
previously-mentioned venues.  The number of folks from the US who would<br/>
be willing to slog through the bogs and put up with the clever arcanity<br/>
of Dartmoor clues (even if they could solve them eventually), I submit,<br/>
quite small indeed. <br/>
******<br/>
<br/>
 Perhaps someone feels that we will 'lower the standard' and make<br/>
non-artful stamps, juvenile clue sets, or worse, sell the idea to Disney<br/>
(ugh again!). <br/>
<br/>
        Well, I doubt not, on all counts. Yes, we are all grappeling<br/>
with the<br/>
'mechanics' of clue-writing, stamp-making, and box-hiding. Well, why not<br/>
help us with suggestions? Everyone here would like to learn how to do it<br/>
better - I for one consider Dartmoor folks as the 'old-timers' with much<br/>
to teach, if you can put up with our niavete.  <br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there is, well, a tad bit of jealousy that we are doing it<br/>
successfully on the net?  Maybe that someone over here had the foresight<br/>
to reserve "Letterboxing.org"?, when rightfully, you might feel, it<br/>
belongs in Dartmoor? <br/>
<br/>
        To this I say, we reserved the "Org" with truely idealistic and,<br/>
I<br/>
hope, noble intent - we heard rumbelings of commercial, centralized,<br/>
structured, encumbering organizational, exclusive control, and decided<br/>
to get there first (that is, reserve 'org' with our open, decentralized,<br/>
non-profit-motivated, open-structured, inclusive vision).  Towards that<br/>
end, if any Dartmoor letterboxers want to find a way to share, by links,<br/>
use of the 'letterboxing.org' domain name, my bets are that the<br/>
resounding YEAs' from here might well be heard across the ocean. <br/>
*****<br/>
<br/>
Please, to any and all those offended by the existance of Letterboxing<br/>
in the US, give us a chance to hear from you directly. I for one would<br/>
like to find common ground and  understanding,  and to focus on what we<br/>
share in interests, rather than on our differences. I promise (at least,<br/>
from me), a respective, open-minded dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone there up to this challange?<br/>
