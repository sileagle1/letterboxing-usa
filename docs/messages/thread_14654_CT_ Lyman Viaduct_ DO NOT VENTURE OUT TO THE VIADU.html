                    <div class="plaintext-content">ok.... no one go out to Lyman Viaduct in Colchester tonight!  It is <br/>
imperative that I go and get Amanda's hitchhiker before someone takes it.  As many of <br/>
you know, Amanda is retiring the Time Flies HH and would like it back.  Someone <br/>
planted it there today, even though Amanda has sent a couple of notes to the <br/>
list saying NOT to plant it.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to go and get it tonight.  If anyone has been to Lyman today, and <br/>
picked up the HH, please let me know immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
