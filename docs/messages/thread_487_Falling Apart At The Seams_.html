Subject: [L-USA] Re: Something odd<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Note: I don't expect the "moderators" of the list to allow this through,<br/>
&gt; but stranger things have happened.  If it doesn't show up on the list, oh,<br/>
&gt; well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can't we all just get along here?  This whole thing (the underpinnings of<br/>
&gt; which I really have little understanding...or care to understand) is<br/>
&gt; beginning to turn me off to a pastime that is fun and encourages people to<br/>
&gt; get out and hike.  I refuse to let that happen.  I like letterboxing too<br/>
much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The bottom line for me is that I don't really care too much about<br/>
copyright<br/>
&gt; notices, clue formats, or who's pissed off at who.  What I care about is<br/>
&gt; that there's a place to publish my clues.  With all of this political B.S.<br/>
&gt; going on, it appears that the only way for me to be sure of this is to<br/>
&gt; publish them myself, and hope that people find my pages.  I won't publish<br/>
&gt; clues on any web site other than my own and will point people to the site.<br/>
&gt; This seems the best way for me to stay away from the "politics" that I<br/>
&gt; dislike so much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks to everyone who's worked to advance the hobby.  Thanks to everyone<br/>
&gt; who's been nice enought to offer me advice and help.  Thanks to everyone<br/>
&gt; who's taken the time and effort to visit my letterboxes.  Letterboxing in<br/>
&gt; the USA will go on, regardless of politics, and I (and I hope all of the<br/>
&gt; others) will continue as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
