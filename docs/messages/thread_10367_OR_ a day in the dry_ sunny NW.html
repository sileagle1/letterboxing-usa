Nancy Drew and Funhog did what any self-respecting letterboxer would<br/>
do, hit the trail. We started at the end of the trail, The Oregon<br/>
Trail, that is. The box and its wonderful stamp were nestled safely<br/>
beneath their log. Next, it was a trip with Mom, Mexico and Me at Mary<br/>
S. Young SP. All six boxes were accounted for, in spite of slightly<br/>
misleading clues to the last two locations. Then, the lure of arches<br/>
and the stone age drew us to the beautiful 2nd Thanksgiving Letterbox<br/>
in Lake Oswego. <br/>
<br/>
A wonderful new collection of images grace the pages of our books.<br/>
Many thanks to Lotta/Lil Bit, Canada Goose and the Forest People for a<br/>
terrific day in the sun. I hate to be greedy but please, all of you,<br/>
plant more boxes. Your carvings are great! Funhog<br/>
