<br/>
Since I have not an ounce of artistic talent, nor a particularly <br/>
steady hand, I'm carving a lot in an effort to come close to the <br/>
talent of some of you who have posted pics of *gorgeous* carvings <br/>
here and elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I've found a source of cheap, decent quality, erasers!  If you have <br/>
a Dollar Tree chain in your area, run there and look for a package <br/>
of 4 white, non-crumbly, erasers.  There are one large and three <br/>
small erasers per pack - total cost, $1 per pack.<br/>
<br/>
The small ones are 2 1/2 by 7/8 by 1/2 inches and are a little less <br/>
creamy-textured than the large one, a little more crumbly.  The <br/>
large one is 3 3/4 by 1 1/2 by 3/4 inches.  It carves very nicely.<br/>
<br/>
I've tried some of the other things listed on various sites, and <br/>
this is the best I've found for the price, which is as close to free <br/>
as you can get.  I hope this may help some other newbie who is in <br/>
danger of going broke practicing his carving.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who have posted helpful info the past couple of weeks, <br/>
like the mounting tutorial and ideas about boxes for kids.  As a <br/>
newcomer, that's the kind of info I crave - thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing to all,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for this information!  I will have to look for one of those!  I<br/>
have had very bad luck in finding carving material near home.  Most<br/>
places have the standard pink erasers with the angled edge... so, you<br/>
only get a very small area to carve on.  <br/>
