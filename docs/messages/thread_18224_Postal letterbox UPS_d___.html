There's another way to track things on the internet if you just mail them. <br/>
You pay an extra $.44 at the P.O for a Postal Delivery Confirmation Receipt. <br/>
It's the form that has fluorescent green stripes on the top. You can use the <br/>
number on the receipt to see when it gets there. I mail all my PLBs that way.<br/>

Unless the creator has a problem with it, or the next address is a PO box, it should be fine.

that is the service I use with my business, because on the rare<br/>

call and they start looking for it (during business hours).  I have<br/>
always been happy with them.  The Post Office makes you wait 30 days<br/>
before looking and by then the trail is cold.  I've also heard good<br/>
things about FedEx ground, they are a little faster than UPS and maybe<br/>
a little cheaper too.<br/>
<br/>
As for having extra people stamp into the logbook, best to ask the<br/>
maker.  Some logbooks only have room for the people on the list.<br/>

Hope this helps.<br/>

 &lt;&lt;&lt; There's another way to track things on the internet if you just<br/>

<br/>
You can also print your own labels with postage online at usps.com - if<br/>
you are mailing via Priority Mail or Express Mail.  And, when you do it<br/>
that way, not only do you not have to stand in line at the PO, but you<br/>
also get FREE delivery confirmation =] <br/>

The shipper needs to notify UPS that it's OK to leave the package at<br/>
your door, and at your request they (the shipper) will do it.  As long<br/>
as you give the shipper the OK to do so, and will relieve them (and<br/>
UPS) of responsibility of loss if the package is stolen after leaving<br/>
it in an open area, because you know the lobby is safe.<br/>
<br/>
My guess with The UPS Store is that you need to rent a box with them<br/>
in order for them to provide the free service of accepting packages.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sorry that you had so much trouble with UPS. I, as the person shipping the PLB, prefer to use it is these simple <br/>
reasons:  <br/>
<br/>
Given their (UPS) tracking number I can track it from source to destination each step of the way.<br/>
If there's a problem, they start looking into it immediately.<br/>
<br/>
When I send a package through USPS, I get a tracking number, but can't do anything with it till it arrives.  Doesn't <br/>
give me a warm fuzzy, but that's just me. I am, after all, a control freak ya know!  (grin) And, if there's a <br/>
potential problem, they make you wait thirty days.<br/>
<br/>
As far as paying for the delivery to the UPS Store, each of those stores (Which used to be Mailboxes Etc,) has to make <br/>
a <br/>
buck to keep the doors open.  Just a convenience kinda thing. Now, what chaps my hide is that, when on my honeymoon, I <br/>
had to have something FedEx'd to the hotel I was staying at. As a registered guest of the hotel, they charged me $5.00 <br/>
to receive and hold my FedEx package till I picked it up.  Just's just too much, in my not so humble opinion!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's just my 2.01028927837 cents worth, your mileage may vary.<br/>
