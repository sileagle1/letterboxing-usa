Directions: From interstate 395 take exit 95,take a right off the exit<br/>
it doesn't matter North or South they both go the same way.Follow the<br/>
road until you come to a intersection in Putnam.Go straight through and<br/>
you will come to another light take a left.Go over a little bridge and<br/>
you come to another light you take a right here onto Church ST.Follow<br/>
this road all the way to the end and you will come to a stop sign,take a<br/>
right and drive over the West Thompson Dam.As soon as you cross over the<br/>
dam their will be a road on your left Reardon RD.take this road and<br/>
travel down 0.2 of a mile.It's easier to pull into Reardon road and<br/>
follow the steel guide rails on the left side of the road,and when they<br/>
end is where you pull in to a small parking lot with a yellow gate<br/>
heading back the way you came.Park and walk around the gate follow the<br/>
path down to a field keep going and the path will turn to the right when<br/>
it gets near the gray rocks at the bottom of the dam.Go around this bend<br/>
and you will see a tree with lots of sisters growing from her and a few<br/>
big rocks on the right side of the path at the egde of the field.Go over<br/>
towards that tree and right before it their will be a stream bed heading<br/>
down to the pond.(Depending on the time of year the stream may be dried<br/>
up it's just a small stream).Follow the stream down towards the pond and<br/>
soon you will come to a trail on the other side of this stream, cross<br/>
over it and stop at the pole with the yellow paint on it at the<br/>
beginning of the trail on the left.Count 59 paces going up this trail<br/>
and you will see a path going into the woods on the right.Enter the path<br/>
and you will see a pole with a tire and chains hanging on it this is<br/>
used to play frisbee golf.In the woods alittle more you will see a old<br/>
chimney,go around to the front of it and take a reading of 165 degrees<br/>
to a huge tree,behind this tree between it and a slab of cement under<br/>
some sticks and leaves is the Virginia letterbox.The NeeDeeps<br/>
