Hi,<br/>
<br/>
What draws you to letterboxing?  The hunt, the stamping, some<br/>
combination of the two, or something altogether different?<br/>
<br/>
I started as a geocacher, and came across letterboxing from that<br/>
angle, and so the hunt is the bigger deal to me, although I love<br/>
seeing and sharing the stamping aspect of letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I would be interested in hearing what other people feel about this<br/>
subject...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

I get a kick out of "placing "letterboxes more than searching for them .<br/>
I mostly enjoy creating /carving the samp itself.<br/>
Next is the finders comments and where they live.<br/>
I think I have more placed than found.<br/>
I will sometimes get on a rampage of one subject such as (Covered<br/>
Bridges )  :)<br/>

<br/>
The idea that I could (and do) create art for public consumption<br/>
without any precepts about what it should look like. IE: a medium for<br/>
my artistic ideas and expression about places, people, and things.<br/>
Most often this is channeled through clues and just artwork, but<br/>
sometimes I'll drop tidbits about the culture and location.<br/>
<br/>
I think of letterboxing as an extension of my surrounding area. What<br/>
would others coming to my town/city/state want to see? How would they<br/>
like to remember it? A stamp, a souvenier if you will - and of course,<br/>
a stamp with text so that you might flip through your log and see<br/>
exactly where you were at that box.<br/>

I enjoy treasure hunting, puzzles, and games (the hunt).<br/>
<br/>
I like artistic self-expression, through many forms of art, by <br/>
others and myself.  <br/>
<br/>
I enjoy being in the woods, getting out there.<br/>
<br/>
Above all I crave exploring.  <br/>
<br/>
All that makes me a hopeless letterboxing devotee.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a hard question!  I enjoy carving stamps and<br/>
then planting boxes, but I love finding boxes too.  I<br/>
think one aspect elevates the other.  It wouldn't be<br/>
nearly as much fun carving stamps if I didn't know<br/>
what pleasure it is to find one, and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
I was showing a group of cub scouts my logbook last<br/>
weekend and I had to explain nearly every single stamp<br/>
in it, telling where I found it, whether it was a<br/>
planted box, a hitchhiker, a personal stamp or an<br/>
event stamp, whether it was my box or someone else's. <br/>
They wanted DETAILS!  As I told the story of each<br/>
stamp, it was like opening the past year and a half up<br/>
and turning it over and looking at it and reliving it,<br/>
and then trying to explain it to someone else.  I<br/>
realized then that it is all woven together and to<br/>
choose between making stamps or finding boxes would be<br/>
like unraveling a blanket - it would never be as<br/>
pretty as it was when it was all together.  <br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, kids quite often "get it" better than<br/>
adults do!<br/>
