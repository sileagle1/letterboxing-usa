 I usually just take a blank book that I buy at big<br/>

<br/>
However, also as a scrapbooker there is much to be said for the "getting there" aspect of finding the box.  We stamp right on the clues sheet, and also any other notes that need to be made we put that right on the clues sheet as well.  All our pages we keep in a 3-ring binder that has a clear cover that the clues sheet can be slipped into and easily read while doing the clues.  <br/>
<br/>
I do have a small scrapbook that never made it to scrapbookhood, that we're using as an exchange book...sadly it only has 2 personal stamps in it, but we're hopeful!  : )<br/>

Just my opinions,<br/>

I was given a blank book a couple of years prior to my discovering<br/>
letterboxing, and I never used it because I didn't have anything<br/>
"cool" enough to put in to match the book.  Of course, letterboxing is<br/>
cool enough for the book. :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok I'll finally jump in. I use a basic hard bound black sketch book. It has<br/>
wonderful thick papers. Not to long after I first started letterboxing a<br/>
letterboxer in the area showed me her beautiful leather cover she had. It<br/>
was from a local leather working place, intended to be a bible cover. She<br/>
had wood burned her signature image on the front. The art sketch book slips<br/>
right in, is protected from the elements, and you have a work of art on the<br/>
cover. At the Passport to Letterboxing I was fortunate enough to win an<br/>
Oberon journal. It is an online company that has all kinds of leather items,<br/>
one line of which is GORGEOUS leather covers. I have the celtic design,<br/>
which I adore. It makes my journal a work of art, a thing of beauty, and<br/>
being leather is practical for being in the PNW (mud, mud mud).<br/>
<br/>
For kids letterboxing journals I found a wonderful site called Bare Books.<br/>
They make professional quality hard bound books with blank covers and blank<br/>
pages. The pages are heavy enough that the ink is not going to bleed through<br/>
and the covers are blank so the kids can decorate them. I don't use them for<br/>
me because they don't have enough pages. (64) but they're great for kids and<br/>
cheap enough to buy lots and let them decorage a new one every month (1.25 a<br/>
piece)<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents worth,<br/>
