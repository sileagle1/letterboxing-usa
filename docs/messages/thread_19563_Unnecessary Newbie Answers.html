newboxers board as I've witness the uh, bellicosity that is aimed <br/>
toward "newbie" questions around here.<br/>
<br/>
Most (99% in fact) of the letterboxers here, new and old, are more <br/>
than willing to help new boxers and answer questions.  It's just <br/>
that some are less willing to answer the same question multiple <br/>
times.  That might seem unfair to a new person here who doesn't know <br/>
how else to get the answer, but on this board its the way of <br/>
things.  On the other board, plenty of new and old boxers hang out <br/>
to provide answers and none mind repetitive questions.  So come on <br/>
over, and ask away.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, however, check out the following sources of <br/>
information ... you'll likely find most of what you seek there:<br/>
<br/>
The LbNA FAQ -- http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html<br/>
Silent Doug's website -- http://www.letterboxing.info/<br/>
The "Folder of Useful Information" -- <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/files/A%20Folder%20of%<br/>
20Useful%20Information/<br/>
The Newboxers group -- http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
