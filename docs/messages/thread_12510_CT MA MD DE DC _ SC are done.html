&gt;Pretty much, anyways, although they're still waiting for a few inputs <br/>
&gt;by owners. I think I'm done updating those states on the old website <br/>
&gt;too, unless I have insomnia on a cloudy night (clear nights I'm under <br/>
&gt;the stars exploring the Virgo galactic fields).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The old What's New is a wrap: please use the new one from now on. <br/>
&gt;We'll be adding some of the familiar functionality to that page soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Current states in progress are NC CA &amp; PA, and when they're done on <br/>
&gt;the new site I'll stop updating the old.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
