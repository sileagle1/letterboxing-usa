<br/>
This is to everyone who contributed, attended, etc.  All I know is we<br/>
had a fantastic time.  This event goes down as very special in my heart!<br/>
I'm amazed at the caring, sharing, talented, kind people we have in our<br/>
letterboxing community.  The camping format seemed to work out very well<br/>
so that people could come and go and letterbox at their leisure<br/>
throughout the weekend.  There was lots of laughter and learning.  It<br/>
was just an amazing time.<br/>
<br/>
LOST &amp; FOUND<br/>
<br/>
After all was said and done some fine items were left behind and if any<br/>
of them are yours, please let me know and I will get them to you someway<br/>
someday.  The following are in our posession:  <br/>
<br/>
Butterknife with rose-type pattern<br/>
<br/>
REI candle lantern<br/>
<br/>
Clipboard with written clues to First Time's The Charm Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
A Pair of really nice chairs<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting us have a great time with y'all.  It was my privilege<br/>
and honor to host this gathering and I am a rich person in heart and<br/>
soul because of your participation.<br/>
<br/>
And even though they were not there, I also want to thank the two guys<br/>
who got me involved in this unbelievable hobby a few years back.  THANKS<br/>
TO MITCH KLINK - DER MAD STAMPER AND THOM CHENEY.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to all of you!  Each of you made this event a really fun<br/>
gathering for all involved.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
