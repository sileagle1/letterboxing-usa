magazine and thought it would be perfect for my family to do together.<br/>
Fortunately, it was a well written article and I understood the discretion<br/>
aspect right away :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We used our fingerprints for the first box.  I was hooked and started asking<br/>
about having someone carve a stamp for me-I knew exactly what I wanted.<br/>
Scoutdogs offered and I have the most perfect stamp.  Been using it 4 years<br/>
with no  intention of changing it in the near future.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But my kids are starting to talk about replacing their store bought stamps<br/>
with  ones they carve.<br/>

I confess . . . I was sig-stampless on my first excursion. But I was <br/>
instantly inspired that afternoon to run to an art supply store to get a <br/>
carving block.<br/>
<br/>
Here's a spin-off question . . .<br/>
How many have updated/enhanced or completely changed there sig-stamp from <br/>
their original carving?<br/>

&gt; newbies to get away from stamping.<br/>
<br/>
Quickie poll: How many of us had a sig stamp in hand when we found<br/>
our *first* letterbox?<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking that there may just be a large contingent of newbies in<br/>
the area, and they're all trying out some finds before they decide<br/>
whether they're going to be interested enough to obtain a sig stamp.<br/>
Somebody may even have suggested it somewhere, like on that infamous<br/>
Chevy Suburban ad or something. Or maybe some primer described<br/>
letterboxing and happened to omit mentioning the need for a sig<br/>
stamp, and all these guys didn't have any idea a sig stamp was called<br/>
for until they found their first box!<br/>
