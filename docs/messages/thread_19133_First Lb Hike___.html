Hikers and Hounds, I am considering going to the event<br/>
you mentioned, but just don't know if I want to attempt it<br/>
without my husband's help. My two year old is an adventurer, to<br/>
say the least, and sometimes travelling to places where<br/>
I might want to actually go and socialize and not keep a<br/>
100% eye on her, are usually not good for us. She likes<br/>
to wander, cut her own hair, cut the dogs hair, draw on herself,<br/>
she'd probably stamp herself silly at the event, etc. So, we'll<br/>
see.<br/>

who is still not sure of what her trail name will be...<br/>
