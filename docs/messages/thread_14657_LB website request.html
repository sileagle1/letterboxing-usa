Since we don't capture any geographic information about a box currently,<br/>
this is rather impossible.  The closest thing we can (and do) have is a<br/>
state<br/>
map with the counties filled in so you can see which counties have boxes.<br/>
Technically, a county is 'geographic information', but we don't have<br/>
anything<br/>
as specific as a zip code, much less coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of, if you know about counties that aren't filled in, please email<br/>
me<br/>
_OFFLIST_<br/>
and let me know.<br/>
<br/>
If you reply to this post on-list (type my address in!  don't hit reply!) I<br/>

likely ignore it and you will become the scourge of the internet, much like<br/>

We'll be on I-90 around Aug. 20 and probably not willing to drive much<br/>
more than 30 minutes or so away from I-90.<br/>
My friend gave me:Friday the 13th, Hampton Ponds, Pagan Pride,<br/>
Perseid, and The Thornton Burgess Series, which are easy boxes. Some<br/>
look like they involve lots of hiking which normally would be OK but<br/>
this time we'll probably be pooped from moving our son into his new<br/>
digs. :-)<br/>

&gt; Hi Catbead,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was sort of wondering the same thing. We're hoping to move to the<br/>
&gt; west coast soon (we're currently on the east coast), and we'd like<br/>
&gt; to find as many boxes on the way as possible. It would be so much<br/>
&gt; easier to figure out which ones to go for if we knew which ones were<br/>
&gt; near the interstate.<br/>

I'll bite on this one. The Vermont Viking was also interested in <br/>
developing this kind of capability, and with the new database driven <br/>
site it is a future possibility. We would need some new GIS-type <br/>
software and to perhaps "partner" with a bigger site like topozone or <br/>
mapquest to make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
To get that function we would also need to add more specific location <br/>
information into the clues, probably either latitude/longitude or zip <br/>
code. Obviously, you can see this type of service working well at <br/>
www.geocaching.com. I'm not sure if you can search "along rte 101 <br/>
from Bakersfield to Gilroy," but you can expand out in 25 mile <br/>
increments from a known spot along 101.<br/>
<br/>
It is much more techie, geocaching-ish than Dartmoorian letterboxing-<br/>
ish.<br/>

this to find all of the geocaches along the I-5 for a trip I was taking.<br/>
<br/>
I see one problem with using a lat-lon function for placing letterboxes on a<br/>
map.  Some people would prefer to keep the location of their boxes slightly<br/>
mysterious.  Even regular (i.e. non-mystery) boxes sometimes couch their clues<br/>
in terms that force people to use their noggins to figure out where the box may<br/>
be.  This can be either because the planter wants to give the finders a mental<br/>
workout or it may be that they don't want to broadcast the exact location to<br/>
avoid unwanted official attention (rangers, city officials, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the fun of letterboxing is the puzzling out of the clues to<br/>
discover where the box lies. Putting the emphasis on lat-lon would make<br/>
latterboxing too much like geocaching and take some of the thrill of the hunt<br/>
out of the equation.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; west coast soon (we're currently on the east coast), and we'd like<br/>
&gt; &gt; to find as many boxes on the way as possible. It would be so much<br/>
&gt; &gt; easier to figure out which ones to go for if we knew which ones were<br/>
&gt; &gt; near the interstate.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope I'm not opening a can of worms here, but would it be asking<br/>
&gt; &gt; too<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; much to have the letterboxing.org website to add on to its search<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; engine the ability to look for nearest towns/cities and nearest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hwy/streets/roads?   Next month we're travelling on I-90 from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Syracuse, NY to Boston/Cambridge, MA, and are looking for some<br/>
&gt; &gt; easy to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get to boxes along the way.  The way the letterboxing.org site is<br/>
&gt; &gt; set<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; up, if not familiar with the area then I need to look at every box<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; every county I-90 passes through to see if it (the box) is near the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; expressway.  And this involves finding the box's location on a<br/>
&gt; &gt; map.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A letterboxing friend has given me some box names which has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; helpful, but I see that being able to search for boxes by city/town<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and street/hwy/road would be a huge help to all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is this asking too much for the webmaster to do?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks,<br/>
