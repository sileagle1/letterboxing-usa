As far as I know, *nobody* has ever found any of those Costa Rican <br/>
letterboxes--but then they are a bit off the beaten path.  =)<br/>
<br/>
And as far as I know, all of the boxes are still alive and well.  In <br/>
fact, if you head out to find them, you might very well be the first <br/>
finders for all of them.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't realize my boxes weren't on the new website and I've now <br/>
added the Costa Rica boxes.  They still don't show up on the map, <br/>
apparently, but if you search of the box it does show up.  =)  I'll <br/>
have to check that all of my Central American letterboxes are on the <br/>
website, though.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of which--check out Guatemala if your looking for some <br/>
Central America adventures.  That place is SOOO much more interesting <br/>
than Costa Rica!  ;o)<br/>
