<br/>
My partner-in-crime/wife (Yep, we're legal in Portland, OR.) uses the same name as her very first email nick, chat name, and, "alter ego," as her current email address and letterboxing name, "Rambopupp."  In fact shes known by the shortened version, "pupp," to most of our everyday coworkers and friends.  (As well as signing all her artwork as, "pupp.")  Pupp's stamp is a cartoon style Labrador with horns and a pitchfork.  Ask Melanie, Maiden1974, just how well that fits.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
My personal stamp is a similar style Labrador wearing cool sunglasses.  My stamp name doesn't have a doggie name though... just my everyday name, Jenn.<br/>
<br/>
Both of our canine kids, "Jett Girl," and, "Tank Girl," go boxing with us most of the time.  They also have their own stamps and personal travelers, just like we do.  <br/>
<br/>
Jett has two jobs.  Her first job was, and sometimes still is, as my assistance dog.  I'm mostly in remission with my health stuff, so Jett now mostly goes to work with Pupp, helping her counsel kids as an official therapy dog.  Letterboxing is an all time favorite activity for Jett.  Jett's personal travler reflects both her jobs.  Her personal stamp is a Lab wearing a halo.  Tank Girl... assistance and therapy dog in training... is new to letterboxing, and loves the walks that it gives her.  Her stamp is a Lab wearing a kid's Beanie with propellor (sp?).<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, we're not a family, as much as we are a pack.  *chuckle*  So when we are *all* present for a find our, "pack stamp," is of a howling wolf (okay... not a doc, but the next best thing) with a moon background and, "Team Nashoba," underneath.  (Nashoba is Choctaw for wolf.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for asking... This has been fun to get to know more about fellow letterboxers!<br/>
<br/>
May your bowl be always full of kibble... your finds many... and your hitchhikers call home often!<br/>

When I read your post, every time I read "B &amp; E" I read it "breaking <br/>

Do the "B and E" stand for anything?  Or do they just have letter <br/>
names?  Letter names is kinda cute :P  I like "Q".<br/>

My husband and I went on a tough hike last weekend and he suggested <br/>
getting a little pack for one of our dogs to carry water or <br/>
something.  But I think our dogs are too small for that :( They're <br/>
only 16 and 25lbs.  If I had a big dog, I'd definately take <br/>
advantage of it.  I carried all of the water for the four of us, and <br/>
it was heavy.<br/>

A little "breaking and entering" is certainly not beneath B &amp; E, but <br/>
their names are Beezley and Elmo and they are golden retrievers.  <br/>
(Their whole names were just too much of a challenge when I made our <br/>
stamp).  Elmo tried out his pack for the first time Saturday, and did <br/>
very well on the whole; he did christen it by walking into a lake.<br/>
<br/>
We wonder how many human boxers take their dogs with them?  Our <br/>
biggest problem is caused by ticks; even though we use Frontline on <br/>
both boys, we have to do a very thorough "tick check" after each trip. <br/>

&gt; When I read your post, every time I read "B &amp; E" I read it "breaking <br/>
&gt; and entering" lol.<br/>
&gt; Do the "B and E" stand for anything?  Or do they just have letter <br/>
&gt; names?  Letter names is kinda cute :P  I like "Q".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband and I went on a tough hike last weekend and he suggested <br/>
&gt; getting a little pack for one of our dogs to carry water or <br/>
&gt; something.  But I think our dogs are too small for that :( They're <br/>
&gt; only 16 and 25lbs.  If I had a big dog, I'd definately take <br/>
&gt; advantage of it.  I carried all of the water for the four of us, and <br/>
&gt; it was heavy.<br/>

&gt; sniffed out a box before I even knew where it was before!) and <br/>
&gt; Princess Abbey.<br/>
