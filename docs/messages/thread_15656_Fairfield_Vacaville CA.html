Hi, newbie letterboxer here.  They call me the Keyboard Wizard from <br/>
Napa, CA.  My boys and I just found the Napa Valley Letterbox last <br/>
Friday and it was our very first!  We were a little disappointed to see <br/>
that it was the only letterbox close to us until I read this email <br/>
today.  Thank you so much A-bear!  We homeschool and every Friday this <br/>
school year is going to be letterboxing day.  Hopefully we won't have to <br/>
drive more than two hours or so to each one.  The boys are already <br/>
excited about making our own, but I told them let's get a feel for it first.<br/>
I'm sorry we missed the Nor Cal Gathering.  Maybe next year when we're <br/>
veterans!<br/>
