meet (&amp; put faces to) the people that I've seen stamp into area boxes &amp; post<br/>
to this list. I'm so glad the weather coorperated, it was beautiful! Thank<br/>
you DocMan for getting this organized. Thank you to Franzsolo for carving<br/>
the event stamp, it is geogeous. &amp; thank you to all who attended and made it<br/>
a great time. Flyfisher was taking photos &amp; said he would let us know when<br/>
they are posted.<br/>
