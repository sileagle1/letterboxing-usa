excellent it is still yours. i think most letterboxers aren't going to judge<br/>
you by the quality of your lettering or your carving. most letterboxers are<br/>
going to appreciate the fact that you carved a stamp and planted it. so, do<br/>
what you want to do!<br/>

whatever *you* want to create.  No matter how simple, how complex, with<br/>
letters, without letters, I love anything that's unique.   If someone took<br/>
the time and effort to create something, it's great.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do, if I want to add wording, is to make two stamps, and thus<br/>
plant two boxes.  One with the wording, one with the "picture."  That way if<br/>
I can't get the wording right and decide to just plain give up, and maybe<br/>
come back to it another day, I still have one box to plant.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Opinion on Stamps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have four Lb's out there and they all have carved stamps that are<br/>
ok. You can tell I'm not an artist, but I think they look all right<br/>
when compared to some I have stamped. I have a tendancy to carve<br/>
something, then carve in the name of the place. My letter carving<br/>
needs a lot of work and I always seem to make a mistake or slip a<br/>
little with the carving tool that ruins the letter.<br/>
<br/>
I'm now leaning more towards making my stamps more symbolic and for<br/>
getting the lettering, until I get better at it. What do you think? Do<br/>
you like stamps that are more just picture art? Or, do you prefer<br/>
stamps that along with a picture has the name of the place carved into<br/>
the stamp? I think that the lettering makes the stamp more of a<br/>
suvinieror<br/>
