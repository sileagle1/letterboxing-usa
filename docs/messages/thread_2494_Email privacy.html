<br/>
    Early on, before there was even a list-serve and after the first was<br/>
established, the people who began this site agreed among ourselves that<br/>
emails were essentially private communications.  Choice of addressee is<br/>
what makes them single or joint communications.  This is an essential<br/>
freedom.  One relies upon the recipient to honor that privacy.  If the<br/>
trust is broken and a letter intended as private is publicly shared then<br/>
one, in my opinion, breaks a sacred trust.  I believe that if one posts<br/>
to the list, it is public: if one sends to the Webmasters, it is a<br/>
communication between the sender and the group of Webmasters,; and if<br/>
someone sends an email to me it is a private communication.<br/>
<br/>
    You may have a different opinion. I ask you to voice it<br/>
respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Susan<br/>
