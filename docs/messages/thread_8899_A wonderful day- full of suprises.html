                    <html><body><p>Mac and I went out for an adventure yesterday and experienced some wonderful suprises. Our first stop was at Kermit's Cousins where we picked up our first HH, Dragon's Tale. Kermit's cousins was missing the treats for the children- none left in the box, but finding our first HH made everything perfect. Then we set out to find Oceanview. Box and contents are fine- a little wet, but the book was in a baggie so it was dry. Here we found our 2nd HH, The Lonely Seagull. Two HH in the same day!!!!! We were unable to leave Dragon's Tale as the hiding spot wasn't big enough. After that we went to find the Daily Break box, the one that got me interested in Letterboxing in the first place. Daily Break is a section of our local newspaper that published a story about letterboxing this past summer. The box is placed in a lovely area that I previously had not known about. When we arrived at the park, we heard the strains of a bagpipe and took a detour to find the piper. He was a  wonderful older gentleman who was practicing out in the open air. After listening to him a while we went back to the clues. We were quite suprised to find that the clues led us right back to him. We explained what we were doing and he joined us for a few minutes while we looked for the box. Now Mac and I are thinking about a Lonely Piper HH.I guess I better get ready to do some carving!</p>
<p>All in aa it was a wonderful way to spend our afternoon.</p>
