Ciao Signore Phineas Boch:<br/>
<br/>
I have heard tales of your assemblage of circus acts from around the United States through a mutual friend in Roma. Please let me introduce myself  I am Signore Marco Peperini, owner of the Venetian-based and world-renowned Pinecone Extravaganza Circo. Our troop takes the early spring off on holiday after a grueling winter season of entertaining daily at both noon and several evening performances, much to the delight of a sold out crowd of both locals and foreigners alike.<br/>
<br/>
While on holiday in your country, I would like to send along one of our acts, Angoscioso la Grandioso. My one concern is that he will not be understood by your fellow countrymen but rest assured that he is revered by children and parents alike from the wine-producing countryside to the ancient streets of Naples. I expect he will be greeted accordingly by your American audience. Please realize that we Italians view the circo in a different light than those of your countrymen.<br/>
<br/>
Please accept Angoscioso la Grandioso as a gift from the Italian people but be advised that he must be returned to our vacationing troop by 15 Giugno in order that he may visit another group of your boxers of letters in the far away district of Michigonia. Feel free to send along any of those acts from your circo that may yearn for the taste of foreign lands and places only seen in picture books. They will be treated with the utmost rispetto and care.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to welcoming back Angoscioso and listening to his many tales of your American circo and its adventures.<br/>
<br/>
Con la massima stima,<br/>
<br/>
Marco Peperini<br/>
<br/>
Venezia, Italia                                     <br/>

Ciao Signore Marco Peperini,<br/>
<br/>
     La dolce vita!  La aventura.  So wonderful to hear from you.  Bueno. Bueno.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     We would be most honored, most honored indeed, to offer hospitality and share our humble ring with Angoscioso la Grandioso.  I am thrilled beyond compare to have a chance to learn from the great Italian circo tradition.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     Our accomodations and our nascent troop are most humble.  It warms our heart to have such an artiste join our little entertainment.  We will take good care of him.  I hope he is not shocked by our simple American ways.  Certainly it shall be a grand experience for all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     I am most interested, most interested, in your offer of a next venue for our show.  We expect to continue performances here for at least two weeks after our debut at which time we can pack up and train out to the great western indian country.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     I, my agent, and my partner Tempus Fugit await the arrival of Angoscioso la Grandioso with the greatest anticipation and wonder.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yours most truly and sincerely, but a humble country Ringmaster,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
