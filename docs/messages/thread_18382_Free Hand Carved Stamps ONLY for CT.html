I have carved 8 piece (CT Counties) that make a puzzle that looks <br/>
like the State of CT, It is really nice all put together ;-)<br/>
I am hoping that I can get 1 person from each county to take the <br/>
stamp and plant it in their county, anyone interested?<br/>

It would be your box, your plant but I would be able to keep an eye on it for you from time to time. If you have no takers, I could also do Windham but lets give it some time I bet there are a few takers on Windham......Chuck and Molly<br/>
