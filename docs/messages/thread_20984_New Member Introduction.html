Just wanted to say hi.  I just discovered letterboxing two days ago, <br/>
and I'm hooked.  Since Sunday, I've gotten six stamps and I'm carrying <br/>
one hitchhiker that I'll drop off at the next location I visit.  It <br/>
was kind of spooky when three letterboxes in a row (on Sunday) showed <br/>
that two people had been there ahead of us that same day.  We went out <br/>
around 11am, so they had to have been there just before us.  It was <br/>
kind of cool actually.<br/>
<br/>
I'm already thinking of how to do my first letterbox.  I think I'll <br/>
make my clues a series of riddles.<br/>

  Just wanted to quickly introduce myself.  I discovered letterboxing last night on another list I am on.  I have been through the website and it looks amazing and like something I am going to get hooked on.  I am going to read through the FAQs so that I don't ask a gazillion questions that you all have been asked before.  <br/>
  As for me, I'm 52, married 27 years to Michael.  I stay at home, doing my art.  I paint mostly, and make art quilts.  I also do paper arts, including altered books.  We have one daughter, 25, who also has her degree in Art.  We have 6 dogs and it gets a bit crazy around here.  We live in the Blue Ridge Mountains ofVirginia and it is truly beautiful here.  I hope there are some letterboxing folks around this area.  <br/>
  Thanks for your time.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
I'm a new letterboxer, too! Thought it would be a cool thing to do with my<br/>
daughter, who is six. She and I went on our first hunts last Sunday, and<br/>
found Robious Landing Park and the Huguenot Cross boxes. We live in<br/>
Richmond, VA.  It was terrific! I'm the leader of my daughter's Brownie<br/>
troop, and I plan to do some letterboxing in the spring with them. I'm<br/>
already planning the placement of several more Richmond-area boxes after the<br/>
holidays. :)<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question, though: when you find a hitchhiker in one of the<br/>
boxes, do you take it with you, or do you stamp it and leave it there? I<br/>
couldn't find the answer in the FAQ.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Christine<br/>

&gt; when you find a hitchhiker in one of the boxes, do you take it with<br/>
&gt; you, or do you stamp it and leave it there?<br/>
<br/>
You take it and hide it in another letterbox.  Silent Doug has some<br/>
good information on the subject at<br/>

with your kids. My 14year old daughter can still be<br/>
drawn on a hunt and she's a great carver. I'm a former<br/>
Girl Scout leader and now a den mother for my son. Be<br/>
cautious when letterboxing with kids.(I mean large<br/>
groups as opposed to your own) Some times they don't<br/>
get the idea of being discreet. If done well and with<br/>
caution it can be a great experience for them. Be<br/>
careful with the boxes you find with your troop and<br/>
observe standard letterboxing etiquette,re-hide well.<br/>
I'e done practice boxes to get them with the program<br/>
before finding the real thing in small adult<br/>
supervised groups.<br/>

&gt; I'm a new letterboxer, too! Thought it would be a<br/>
&gt; cool thing to do with my<br/>
&gt; daughter, who is six. She and I went on our first<br/>
  It was terrific! I'm the leader of my<br/>
