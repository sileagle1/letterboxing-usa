                    <div class="plaintext-content">WOW!!!    I pondered long and hard whether to use a list of locations, or to<br/>
take a calculated guess (risk?!) regarding Rocky Narrows.    I figured that<br/>
is the most well-known and easily accessible place in Sherborn.<br/>
Phew...glad that paid off...or there would be a lot of figuring to do for<br/>
the final guess.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 maps of this Trustees location.   One shows the trails (it is the<br/>
Trustees map), and the intersection markers.    The trails themselves are<br/>
not numbered or named, but there are markers at the intersections.   I.e. if<br/>
you were giving someone a hiking route, you'd tell them to "turn left at<br/>
#21"   or "Head South at #10."        Map #2 is a slightly different map,<br/>
but guess what is on it???   STONE WALLS!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So...my thinking is I need to get my two maps together and put together a<br/>
list of marker numbers.     One could go two ways with this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a)       Try to figure out which marker numbers are nearest the end of a<br/>
stone wall<br/>
<br/>
b)      Try to figure out which marker  numbers are NOT likely to be near<br/>
the location.<br/>

C) While you're pondering the Final Question, perhaps a posse of local<br/>
boxers could meet and each cover a section of wall while considering the<br/>
final question.  I'm sure someone is out looking for the box as we type.<br/>

O no, hardly!!!     There are many who worked hard to get it narrowed down<br/>
to Mass, and then to proceed though the counties and towns.    I've just<br/>
been selfishly hoping for Sherborn, b/c I happen to live right in the area.<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Congrats to you on pulling together what sounds like an awesome gathering!!<br/>
I'm very glad to hear you didn't have as much of the nasty rain as they<br/>
called for.   It's been .um.soggy..at this end of the state.   :-)<br/>

Well, I see we're down to Sherborn and Rocky Narrows Reservation.  I've <br/>
noticed that the reservation, according to their map, is on both town <br/>
forest land and Trustees of Reservations land.<br/>
<br/>
Might it be a question if we asked if it was on Trustee's land instead <br/>
of town land?  Just a last second thought.<br/>

Where did you get the map that shows the stone walls? Is it an online  map?<br/>
<br/>
Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
If you didn't already get it, here is a link to the Rocky Narrows page. On  <br/>
the bottom of the right hand column you will find a link to a map.<br/>
<br/>
_http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/360_rocky_narrows.cfm_ <br/>
(http://www.thetrustees.org/pages/360_rocky_narrows.cfm) <br/>
<br/>
One last thought, remember the clues say it is 5 feet from the end of a  <br/>
stone wall. This doesn't necessarily mean it is in the wall. Whoever hunts for  <br/>
this should keep that in mind.<br/>
