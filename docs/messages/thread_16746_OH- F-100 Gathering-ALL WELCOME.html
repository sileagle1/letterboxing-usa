                    <div class="plaintext-content">There will be a gathering in Ohio where the F-100 stamp carved by Scoutdogs will be passed around to those who qualify, however, if you do not qualify, you can still attend! I'll make an event stamp for everyone, but especially those not yet ready to get the F-100 stamp. Come for the exchanges, the socializing, the event stamp, the food, etc. ALL ARE WELCOME! The F-100 stamp will go in the mail after the party, so if you have found 100 boxes, &amp; you can't make it to the party &amp; you want to get the F-100 stamp- email me your snail mail address so you can get on the list. The list will be open for those who reach this milestone in the future.<br/>
<br/>
The gathering will be Saturday Nov. 15th at 5pm at the Bob Evans in Milford, Ohio (On the East side of Cincinnati in S.W. Ohio).<br/>
