[received on the Orienteering-net today (edited RH).  PS, They already<br/>
 know about what we do]<br/>
<br/>
I recently invented a similar sport that I call the GPS Stash Hunt. It<br/>
started as a result of the U.S. government removing the errors from the<br/>
GPS navigation system. Now, someone with a GPS can actually find something<br/>
from posted coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
The basic rules when you find a stash are:<br/>
<br/>
1. Take Something<br/>
<br/>
2. Leave Something<br/>
<br/>
3. Write about it in the log book<br/>
<br/>
That's all....<br/>
<br/>
Since the game is only two weeks old, it is already evolving, we now<br/>
have different kinds of stashes based on how you find them. i.e.: <br/>
Stamped offset Stash, and Circle offset Stash, these are methods of <br/>
making the find a little more difficult. I'm sure you orienteering <br/>
folks could also add some interesting difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
Please visit the stash hunt website at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.triax.com/yngwie/gps.html<br/>
<br/>
for more information..<br/>
<br/>
Your suggestions and insight could be helpful in evolving the game!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,,<br/>

HI, This is interesting.  My husband is an avid hunter and uses a handheld <br/>
GPS to navigate through the woods ( to be very honest I think he mostly plays <br/>
with it after he is finished hunting).  He suggested hiding a few letterboxes <br/>
that are merely coordinates with a few clues right at the end.  We have held <br/>
off, thinking very few Letterboxers have a GPS yet.  What is the GPS count <br/>
out there? <br/>

 What about the Year 2000?  According to the Bible there was approximately <br/>
4000 years between Creation and Jesus' Birth (approx. 1000 from Creation to <br/>
the Flood then 3000 to Jesus' Birth)... There is a lot of hype about the new <br/>
millennium; can we expect the apocalypse?  Check out this site to answer <br/>

The very first letterbox placed in Oregon (Brown's Camp), WAS placed<br/>
with a borrowed GPS.  The only way to find that box is with a gps.  Now<br/>
that the accuracy is a little better, I should prolly go back out and<br/>
recheck the coordinates and see how close they are to accurate.<br/>
<br/>
The clues are on the LBNA web site.<br/>
<br/>
Dan'l bought a GPS and was loaning it out at one time.  A few 'boxers<br/>
placed, or at least contemplated placing a box using it.<br/>

Yeah, all it takes to get us guys involved in something is to have a <br/>
great electronic toy involved in the activity ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anyone has recently found the boxes that were originally <br/>
placed using Dan's gps way back in the beginning of US letterboxing <br/>
(seems forever ago).<br/>
