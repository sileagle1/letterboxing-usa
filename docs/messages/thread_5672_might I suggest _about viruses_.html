I'm not going to moderate the list, at least not without a poll asking<br/>
me to.<br/>
<br/>
What I did do is set it to only members can post.  That means it will<br/>
be a hassle for newbies and people who want to send in clues but don't<br/>
want to be on the list.  It will create a "members only" vibe, which seems<br/>
pretty sick to me, but less sick than moderation.  If people disagree, then <br/>
it can be changed.<br/>
<br/>
All of the messages I checked came from non-members (well, one non-member<br/>
really).  You can't ban non-members.  I did ban this person from joining<br/>
the list.  If you feel like it, send nasty messages to abuse@their.isp<br/>
<br/>
Now, if a virus comes to the list, it will be from a member.  If that <br/>
happens, the member will be banned or moderated, depending on my mood <br/>
and depending if I have time to figure out who it is.  Since I don't run <br/>
anti-virus software, I just sort of look at the thing and see if it looks <br/>
like a virus, or if someone tells me its a virus I'll ban the sender.<br/>
<br/>
Clean up your systems and stop using vulnerable software.  I have no <br/>
patience  for people who insist on using vulnerable software and them <br/>
ask me to deal with list settings to prevent viruses and restrict flow <br/>
of content.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
This is a temporary solution.  The list can decide what the long term<br/>
solution should be.  Note that this particular worm is designed to<br/>
be around a long time.<br/>

You do know that the virus that seems to be coming to the list is the <br/>
one that fakes the "from" email address?<br/>
<br/>
A virus could still come from a non-member if the virus faked the <br/>
"from" address. That would fool Yahoo into think it came from a <br/>
member.<br/>
<br/>
  Banning the sender of the email isn't fair, in my opinion. I have <br/>
gotten several "unable to deliver" messages sent to my email address, <br/>
though I have not sent the email that is included in the <br/>
returned/unable to deliver message.<br/>
<br/>
I think banning attachments, and leaving the list open for anyone to <br/>
post to it, would be the best option.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, if anyone gets a virus from my address, it's impossible <br/>
that it really came from me. With an virus program, NO addressbook <br/>
(yes, you read that right -- even if I got a virus that could thwart <br/>
my email proram, it could not send email to anyone because I have no <br/>
addressbook), Eudora for my email, and a Macintosh computer, there is <br/>
no way for the virus to come from me.<br/>

There are perfectly valid reasons that attachments should be<br/>

Yes, I work in internet security for a living.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; A virus could still come from a non-member if the virus faked the<br/>
&gt; "from" address. That would fool Yahoo into think it came from a<br/>
&gt; member.<br/>
<br/>
Tnen that would be a yahoo bug.  If that's the case, we'll deal with<br/>
it.  I would hope that yahoo's system is more sophisticated than that<br/>
(but come to think of it, it prolly isn't).  In any case, of all the <br/>
messages I examined, in no case was the From: a member.  Also, keep in <br/>
mind that there is no 100% solution as long as people are allowed to <br/>
post ... if yahoo doesn't detect From: spoofing, and the From: happens<br/>
to be one of the 443 addresses on the list, one will get thru once in<br/>
a while ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;   Banning the sender of the email isn't fair, in my opinion. I have<br/>
&gt; gotten several "unable to deliver" messages sent to my email address,<br/>
&gt; though I have not sent the email that is included in the<br/>
&gt; returned/unable to deliver message.<br/>
<br/>
I can usually determine who actually sent the mail from the transit<br/>
headers (or at least can tell if the headers are forged -- or who didn't<br/>
send it, anyway).  I think it was more an idle threat in any case :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think banning attachments, and leaving the list open for anyone to<br/>
&gt; post to it, would be the best option.<br/>
<br/>
Except that people like sending clues to the list via attachments.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm philosophically apposed to allowing a few idiots to compromise<br/>
the functionality of the list ... its sort of like being afraid to fly.<br/>
I'd rather try to ban the idiots than legitimate uses of the list. <br/>
<br/>
(and if you ban attachments, you will still get a ton of annoying empty<br/>
messages, which doesn't seem like as elegant a solution).<br/>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I moderate a few Yahoo!Groups lists, and 
frankly, we've had enough headaches with people being shut out of the lists by 
the software when Yahoo tried to merge the Clubs and Groups.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Right now, I can't even think of more maintenance 
hours than that's requiring... not for my lists with more than 200 members, 
anyway.  (Yes, for one of my limited-interest ghost lists, I've started 
actively moderating because that's not a huge time consumer.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Toxic email is a problem, but listmail accounts for 
just a small percentage of viral emails I receive each day.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have a simple policy of not opening any 
attachment unless I absolutely, positively know who it's from.  And even 
then, if I'm not expecting an attachment, I still don't open it.  If I do 
figure that it's trustworthy, I virus-check it into the ground, 
first.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, I keep my Address Book empty, just in 
case.  And the only virus I've had in years was in a macro from an 
ought-to-be-reliable database file, from a major theme park 
hotel.  Go figure.  *shrug*</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I haven't had time to track this latest virus 
series, and if these emails aren't coming from infected members... just how are 
we in someone's Address Book... or is this one being distributed 
differently?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most of my own lists don't permit attachments, but 
on this list, I can see that it's worthwhile to retain that option.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's my two cents.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cheerfully,</div>
<div>Ais</div></body></html>

funhog1 astutely observed:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; There are perfectly valid reasons that attachments should be<br/>
&gt; permitted. [...] Some of the most clever letterboxers have <br/>
&gt; been known to [...]. Banning these would be ludicrous. <br/>
<br/>
I imagine there are perfectly valid reasons to allow non-members <br/>
to post as well.  My guess is that those reasons underlie why it<br/>
has been that way for several years.<br/>
<br/>
I think what it comes down to is that some have felt this list<br/>
is different than "traditional" lists.  It is not to talk about <br/>
letterboxing, but rather one of the toys in the toybox to play <br/>
letterboxing.  So that makes it different than a list where you <br/>
talk about fixing cars or something.  Thus, no moderator has the <br/>
right to decide who should play, and how they should play, or if <br/>
a particular post constitutes junk or play.  I guess those who <br/>
aren't configured to filter viruses and spam right about now <br/>
aren't seeing this the same way :-)  I guess those who have thought<br/>
this way are a smaller and smaller percentage.  I guess some have<br/>
felt that since to get on the net you have to configure your system<br/>
to deal with the junk anyway, that it is a no-brainer (now, those<br/>
who are configured lose a cool toy, and gain nothing, for no benefit<br/>
to anyone except those whose sole internet experience is this list.<br/>
Not a good deal.)<br/>
<br/>
I'll drop it now.  At least this way, those affected have no voice,<br/>
so it will prolly not come up again.  I just wanted to explain to<br/>
those with ears to hear that there is a reason the list is the way<br/>
it is, and that that reason is not that the moderator is an idiot<br/>
who doesn't know how to point his browser at the list configuration<br/>
options on yahoo :-)<br/>
<br/>
(BTW Eliza, I didn't intend to offend you (or anyone), but I won't<br/>
back down from the attitude that those who do not know how to <br/>
operate a computer safely should not be on a public network (an apt <br/>
analogy comes to mind ...) but I'll admit this attitude is off-topic.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
Randy<br/>
Who will miss Capt. Aubrey, non-member clues, and other pranks ...<br/>
<br/>
PS, since I made the change yesterday, yahoo set my preferences <br/>
to convert mail to html for some reason.  If anyone else is experiencing <br/>
this annoying conversion, that is the reason, tho changing it back hasn't<br/>
fixed it, at least on messages posted from the web site ...  I still<br/>
may continue to tinker with the configs or change it back, but prolly<br/>
won't talk more about it ...<br/>
