                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK everyone!  I've finally gotten around to labeling all of my stamps from <br/>
the Maine Gather and there are quite a few I can not label!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the names of the eleven boxes that were planted for the <br/>
gather?<br/>
<br/>
I have stamps of two hitchhikers who appeared at the gather: one was an <br/>
orange knapsack and the other a small bird.  I believe both were at the table with <br/>
Mary from RI, and Safari Man (?).  What are the names of these two hitchhikers?<br/>
<br/>
I also have an exchange stamp of a fence (dark pink ink) with flowers.  Who's <br/>
stamp is that?<br/>
<br/>
Any info would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
I called them "Just for the Day," which is the header that was <br/>
printed at the top of the clues.  I believe they were planted by <br/>
Phynstar, so maybe she has another name for them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think that was "Don't Panic," launched by The Elfs.  I don't have <br/>
my log book in front of me so I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and the other a small bird.<br/>
<br/>
"Chickadee," launched by Pine Tree, Pine Cone, Pine Needle.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I also have an exchange stamp of a fence (dark pink ink) with <br/>
flowers.  Who's stamp is that?<br/>
<br/>
I think that's Leslie Davidow.  I think.<br/>
