<br/>
Sheila, Sylvia and I have been on a couple of outings to seek each other's<br/>
letterboxes.  I had 4 in Garland--3 came up missing the end of last year<br/>
(just as I was ready to place several more).  Now there's just one out<br/>
there in Garland.  Sheila's is in Plano unless she picked it up due to the<br/>
remodelling they're doing all over the park she had placed it in.  Sylvia's<br/>
still seeking the perfect spot I think...and busy with hundredsof other<br/>
things.  Shannon may have put hers out there somewhere by now...Shannon???<br/>
<br/>
I'll be sure to let you know when I overcome my grief at the loss of 3<br/>
boxes at once (I'm being dramatic, truly, but I can't seem to get back out<br/>
there) and place the boxes I have ready to go.<br/>
