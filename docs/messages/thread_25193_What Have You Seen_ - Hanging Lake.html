                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I first started letterboxing there were not many boxes in TX, so I knew the only way I would be able to find any was to look during vacation.  My family was already planning on going to Colorado to see the usual awesome scenery, but I decided to include a letterbox in the itinerary.  Since none of them likes to letterbox, I could pick only one, and it had to include something they would like besides finding the box.  There weren't many boxes in Colorado at that time, either, but I noticed one by Drew Clan that looked interesting called Hanging Lake.  Now I had been to Colorado many times, but had never heard of this place, so I printed the clues and hoped for the best.  It ended up being a great hike with beautiful waterfalls, and the family loved it so much they didn't even notice when I went to stamp into the box!<br/>
<br/>
Though they didn't become letterboxers because of this hike, they did become more tolerable to letting me plan letterbox stops on future vacations.  This was the first example of what I like best about letterboxing:  being lead to places I never would have known about.  Thanks Jay!<br/>
