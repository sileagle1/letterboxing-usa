I'm looking into hiking the Appalachian Trail!  I only got the idea a <br/>
couple of weeks back but took to it like a fish in water.  According <br/>
to my "sources", the typical thru-hiker is thinking about the hike <br/>
for ten YEARS before starting the adventure, so I've got some serious <br/>
catching up to do!  But wow, what an adventure!  Over 2,000 miles <br/>
from Georgia to Maine and through 12 other states, on foot.  They say <br/>
the elevation gain of all the hills adds up to climbing Mt Everest <br/>
from sea level to the top 16 times!<br/>
<br/>
And I'm thinking of creating a letterboxing series along the entire <br/>
route.  The world's longest letterboxing chain.  I'm thinking perhaps <br/>
a letterbox every 20 to 25 miles sounds good (which adds up to about <br/>
100 letterboxes!)  That might be a little too ambitious, though, <br/>
since I'll probably be too tired to carve a new stamp virtually every <br/>
day.  Unless I can pre-carve most of them before I hit the trail, but <br/>
that's still a lot of stamps to be carving!  And since Internet <br/>
access is limited when you're miles away from the nearest <br/>
civilization, I might not even have a chance to type in all the clues <br/>
for a hundred boxes along the way.  But it's a dream of mine.  =)  A <br/>
series that stretches for over 2,000 miles along the east coast.<br/>
<br/>
And if I'm REALLY lucky, I'll finally get a chance to meet a bunch of <br/>
you east coast folks I've always heard stories about and swap e-mails <br/>
with all the time!<br/>
<br/>
But gosh, that's my next BIG adventure I'm thinking about.  My feet <br/>
are sore just thinking about the trip, but my spirits are high!  =)<br/>

was first introduced to letterboxing an "AT series" was on the top of <br/>

scouted out for the spring thaw. I must say that anyone planting <br/>
boxes on the AT should be careful where they put them. The trail is <br/>
closely monitored and if the location is deemed harmful or to far off <br/>
trail the box could be pulled. Anyway, I think you're idea is great. <br/>
I am sure with some careful planning the logistics could be worked <br/>
out. Personally, I would love to see a daily diary posted online that <br/>
all of us armchair wanna-be's could read.<br/>

There will definitely be one of those on my website, although due to <br/>
the lack of Internet access on the trail, it might be "time <br/>
delayed".  Even WITH Internet access I have a bad habit of writing up <br/>
my adventures weeks or months after they actually happen!  =)<br/>
