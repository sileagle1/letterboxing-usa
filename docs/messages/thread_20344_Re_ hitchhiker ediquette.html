letterboxing, I went to a gathering or 2 and was guilty of stamping <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally, I stamp on one page with our family stamp and sign all of our trail names usually 2-6 names depending on who or which dog was with me at the find.  I also list where I found it and where I'm placing it along with those stamps (if the box I found it in isn't already stamped in that is).  All of this usually takes a full page. <br/>
<br/>
I don't plan on stamping the HH at my first gathering, MMM, I too believe that this would take the fun out of future finds!<br/>

stamp on the back side of someone else's stamp, in case the HH owner wanted to <br/>
make a scrapbook out of the images and take them from the log to put into a <br/>
bigger book.   Then again, if there was a note on the book saying to stamp both <br/>
sides, then I'd follow directions.   <g><br/>
