&gt; Just when you thought it was safe to out in Maryland...I just saw the<br/>

&gt; anthrax letter business. Snipers, hunters, snow, and now this. I<br/>

At 08:05 AM 12/13/2002 -0500, Dog Scouts Troop so spoke:<br/>
&gt;I didn't think Anthrax could survive in the cold? Are they saying it's<br/>
&gt;possibly in the park? Sorry, I haven't seen/heard the news lately.<br/>
<br/>
They're apparently searching the pond for lab equipment that may have been <br/>
dumped there. Here are some news stories:<br/>
http://news.google.com/news?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Gambrill+Park<br/>
<br/>
They claim the land and water there has already been tested and is safe, <br/>
but many areas of the park are doubtless closed to the public while the <br/>
police do their stuff.<br/>

The investigation includes the bodies of water in the<br/>
park. This spins off of the investigation of the man<br/>
that was at Fort Deitrick. Something may have been<br/>
dumped in the area...I did not catch what it may have<br/>
been or what they hope to find. I know little about<br/>
the nature of anthrax. I usually go with my little<br/>
one so I don't take chances with snakes much less<br/>
this.<br/>

Ok --I should be doing something else..I really don't have time to be <br/>
doing this but--I was curious to see how many boxes there were in <br/>
different states, so I spent about 15 minutes gathering the following <br/>
numbers ... <br/>
<br/>
Numbers per the current list:<br/>
<br/>
1.Connecticut 828 (We obviously have too much time on our hands-LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
2.Ohio 291 <br/>
<br/>
3.Massachusetts 243<br/>

Subject: Announcing Winter Gathering<br/>
<br/>
Hi all! It's me Rustypuff!<br/>
<br/>
It's been a long crazy year and I thought what better way to end it than<br/>
with a winter gathering.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to invite all 'boxers to join us on Saturday January 18th<br/>
beginning at high noon (although ongoing after that for late comers) at the<br/>
Moose Hill Wildlife Sanctuary in Sharon, MA in the Nature Center for a<br/>
winter potluck.<br/>
<br/>
I will provide soft drinks and juice and an appetizer. There will also be a<br/>
hot drink table with tea, instant coffee and hot cocoa. Bring along your<br/>
favorite dish (and recipes! since that seems so popular!)and your<br/>
letterboxing gear. There are five boxes on the sanctuary here and I will<br/>
probably be hiding a box for the gathering. I will also carve an event stamp<br/>
 but would encourage others to do the same.The more the merrier!<br/>
<br/>
The event will be hosted by me (Rustypuff)and CSCM, and though I work at the<br/>
Sanctuary, please don't contact them for information. Just post to the list<br/>
for either one of us and we will answer any questions.<br/>
<br/>
Please RSVP to me and I will keep a count of who's coming (gotta know how<br/>
much soda to buy!). Also please note, pets are not allowed at the<br/>
Sanctuary(sorry! - not my rule)<br/>
<br/>
I am excited to see you all (since I missed the Mystery gathering) and I<br/>
hope you all have a wonderful holiday!! (directions are below)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Directions to Moose Hill<br/>
<br/>
The Nature Center is the large white estate house located at the<br/>
intersection of Moose Hill Street<br/>
and Moose Hill Parkway. The parking lot is on Moose Hill Parkway, adjacent<br/>
to the Nature Center .<br/>
<br/>
Follow signs with the Massachusetts Audubon Society logo (blue triangle with<br/>
a tern in the center) along the way.<br/>

We have about 4 to 5" of snow cover.  Most of the hiding places will <br/>
be burried.  Some boxes could be frozen into the ground.  Last <br/>
winter boxes here were visited as I have seen in the logs, but it <br/>
was a mild winter.  Unless you hear that the snow has melted away, <br/>
postpone the trip.  Late March and April would be better.  Then you <br/>
can see the fabled New England mud season.<br/>
