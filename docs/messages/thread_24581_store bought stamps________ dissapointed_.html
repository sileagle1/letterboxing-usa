                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've had one box so far where the stamp was missing.  I was frustrated<br/>
about it only because I didn't know -why- it was missing.  Was it<br/>
stolen? Did it get broken? Did it get dropped in the brush by accident?<br/>
<br/>
As for finding a store bought stamp... its happened once so far.  I<br/>
mentioned it before, but I don't mind a store bought.  I wish it had<br/>
been hand carved, but its not a big deal.  And I wouldn't be less<br/>
inclined to find a box if the Planter said it was store bought.<br/>
<br/>
So yeah, I'm more disappointed when its gone.<br/>
