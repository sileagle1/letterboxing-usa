unfortunately prone to vandalism it seems.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a report that it was lying nearby on the open ground.  I <br/>
visited today and found it again lying out of it's hiding place on <br/>
the ground.  I replaced it and hid it a little better with leaves and <br/>
a rock.  That might help.<br/>
<br/>
But if you want to visit this letterbox in its interesting hiding <br/>
place you may need to visit soon.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be giving much away if I told you that there is a back <br/>
entrance to Fort Marcy on Chain Bridge Road.  It's just a pull off at <br/>
a fence opening, a green painted fence post and a fire hydrant <br/>
halfway between the Parkway and the bridge.  Otherwise you have to <br/>
drive from Key Bridge down the GW Parkway all the way almost to Route <br/>
123 for the official Parkway entrance.  The Fort Marcy web site might <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>
