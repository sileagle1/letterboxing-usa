My wife is the one who posts under this name, but I wanted to come <br/>
onto this board and publicly wish a very Happy Valentines Day to the <br/>
love of my life.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many ways she loves and cares for our family. <br/>
Letterboxing has admittedly been something I've had to warm up to. <br/>
I've learned to enjoy the hikes and enjoying being outside as a big <br/>
part of letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
This is yet another way that our family spends time together. It is <br/>
no surprise at all that she has a hobby and passion for something <br/>
that brings our family together more. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Valentines day, Kim. The greatest quest I've ever known is the <br/>
lifetime I'll spend getting closer to your heart. Keep giving me the <br/>
clues and directions, and I'll pursue it the rest of my life. <br/>
<br/>
