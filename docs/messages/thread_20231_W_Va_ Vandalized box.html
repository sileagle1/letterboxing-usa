On Labor Day we found the "Great Spirit" letterbox uncovered with no<br/>
stamp or logbook. The container was uncovered with it's red top very<br/>
obvious. The only other thing we found, after looking around, was the<br/>
pen and the empty ziplock bag with "Great Spirit Letterbox" written on<br/>
it. <br/>
It's sad to see yet another wonderful letterbox being destroyed<br/>
because people are not being careful either in not being observed by<br/>
non letterboxers as they put the box back, or people are not taking<br/>
the time to carefully recover the box so nothing shows. <br/>
This was in a Very high trafficed area, but it's still sad to see.<br/>
Luckily the Seneca Rocks letterbox was doing just fine.<br/>
