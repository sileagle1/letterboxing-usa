&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just when you thought it was safe to out in Maryland...I just saw the<br/>
&gt; news and now there is an investigation in Gambril Park regarding the<br/>
&gt; anthrax letter business.  Snipers, hunters, snow, and now this.  I<br/>
&gt; think I might just stay indoors until Spring.<br/>

<br/>
They're apparently searching the pond for lab equipment that may have been <br/>
dumped there. Here are some news stories:<br/>
http://news.google.com/news?num=50&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Gambrill+Park<br/>
<br/>
They claim the land and water there has already been tested and is safe, <br/>
but many areas of the park are doubtless closed to the public while the <br/>
police do their stuff.<br/>
