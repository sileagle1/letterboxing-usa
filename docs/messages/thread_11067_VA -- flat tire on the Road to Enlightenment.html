                    <html><body><div><div>We were so excited to be out looking for our first letterbox in weeks!  The snow is melting and the thermometer is creeping upwards.   Although it is temperate, we decided to try for some inside boxes rather than get stuck in the mud and puddles outside.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately, we didn't get too far on our road trip toward enlightenment.  We're hoping that maybe someone else had the boxes out stamping at the time we were looking....  (that would make us feel better than just not being able to find them!).  We were only able to locate the second box (was it with the help of the divine or the other?!)  Box 1 and 3 eluded us.  We did, however, find a neat book about 101 activities for fighting siblings!  This was very appropriate considering the behavior of the younger BeMa's after trying to keep still and quiet in the library for an hour!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box #2 was our 50th box!  We are very proud to be half way toward our goal of 100 in one year's time (now if we could only get up to CT -- we could wrap up our quest in a day or two!...)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Has anyone found box #1 or #3 in this series recently?  The library was doing a lot of reshelving with books stacked on tables and all sorts of signs...  Hopefully no librarian put the boxes aside thinking "that dewey decimal number doesn't seem right"...  BeMa</div>
