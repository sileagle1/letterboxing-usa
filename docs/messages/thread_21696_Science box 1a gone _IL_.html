Oh no!  Was that the one by the bridge?  We did those months ago -- I loved <br/>
your carving.  The "slider" carving -- the one with the little person going <br/>
down the little slide? -- was just great.  It's amazing someone can carve that <br/>
tiny.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes Pippi it was the one by the bridge. The reason I am not replacing it is because it is a high traffic area and several non-letterboxers had found it. They were nice enough to leave a note though and put the box back. The slider box has been moved and has new clues. The original hiding spot was cut down. You probably would not even recognize the park anymore. The park district cut down about twenty trees. I do have plans for a series in DeKalb and hopefully this summer I will find time to carve the five stamps. Thanks for the comments.<br/>
