                    <div class="plaintext-content">just wanted to post a small note on the boxes that i found this <br/>
weekend:<br/>
1.  Harry Potter Series, first box.  Found this one easily.  We were <br/>
looking forward to finding the others, but had a little trouble, <br/>
plus my 2 year old was afraid of monsters (a new fear of hers these <br/>
days), so we had to leave before finishing.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Hammel Pond and Hammel Pond II.  Hammel Pond was wet, but still <br/>
there.  Hammel Pond II was in very good shape.<br/>
<br/>
I introduces letterboxing to my nephews and neice this weekend with <br/>
these boxes. My neice is very interested and we are planning a trip <br/>
in the near future to finish the Harry Potter series placed by <br/>
ScoutDogs.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
