LOCK&gt;ROCK<br/>
<br/>
At the lock called 21<br/>
Head downriver and you've begun<br/>
The path is flat with lots to see<br/>
Run, walk, ride or even ski!<br/>
Under the bridge<br/>
To the farm road above<br/>
Make a stop at the stand<br/>
For veggies you'll love...<br/>
Then meander along<br/>
Past the Federal style home<br/>
Keep your eyes on the woods<br/>
your not alone!!<br/>
A bridge over water<br/>
That carries the same<br/>
And on towards the smoke stack<br/>
That has no name<br/>
These "rocks" are high<br/>
It's an ancient place<br/>
Look at them softly<br/>
They may show their face..<br/>
Stop at the lock called 20<br/>
Take the time<br/>
And you can learn<br/>
Plenty!<br/>
Falling water<br/>
Heard in spring<br/>
Once ice they climbed<br/>
With ropes and things<br/>
Past the white fleshed<br/>
Double tree<br/>
Then to a single with mail slot<br/>
You'll see!!<br/>
CAREFUL NOW<br/>
Passing eyes...<br/>
In the slot on right<br/>
You'll find the prize!!<br/>
