                    <div class="plaintext-content">Has anyone ever thought of doing a "progressive letterbox"?  Starts out as a hitchhiker, but with only one component... let's say the container.  The letterboxer who finds the progressive hitch-hiker adds another component... let's say a hand-carved stamp.  The final letterboxer would add the last component (ie., the log) and any other additional goodies they wish and would send the completed letterbox on its way as a full-fledged hitch-hiker.<br/>
<br/>
Another variation would be a "round robin" by mail.  Letterboxer #1 sends letterboxer #2 an empty log.  Letterboxer #2 puts it in a container and mails it to letterboxer #3.  Once its a completed letterbox, it could be mailed to the originator for planting or could become a hitch-hiker passed along by the person who completes it with its final component.  <br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I'm a real newbie!  This is day #2 for me in the hobby.  I have one virtual find and one physical find so far.  No plants or exchanges yet.  But today was my first physical find, and I have to say, that was QUITE exciting!!!!! :D<br/>
<br/>
So, anyone, these ideas could be dumb or already-tried or whatever, but I just thought of them and thought I'd pass them along.  Thanks!<br/>
