some time.  The clues make sense to me, but there are so many<br/>
possibilities.  I know the general area.  I have taken in a number of<br/>
restaurants hoping to find it.  I always stay for a meal because I feel<br/>
guilty leaving without ordering.  I have another one in mind, and I will<br/>
not give up until I find it.<br/>

&gt; for the past 3 months, i have been looking for a box that is located in<br/>
&gt; the town next to me and i haven't found it yet. the clues make no sense,<br/>
&gt; but thats because i haven't gotten deep enough into the mind of the<br/>
&gt; placer. just because i cant find it, doesn't mean im going to ask for<br/>
&gt; change. i feel evey boxer should , if they feel like it, have thier own<br/>
&gt; identity. i don't have to change. you just have to box like me. i cheer<br/>
&gt; for challenge.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   happy with how things are!<br/>
