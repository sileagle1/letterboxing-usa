2nd Annual Winter Icebreaker Gather<br/>
Saturday, January 29, 2005 <br/>
11:00am to 3:00pm or whenever<br/>
Pentagon City Mall Food Court<br/>
Arlington, VA<br/>
<br/>
Close to Metro, food, and shopping.  With good parking (cheap).<br/>
Obviously this isn't a "boxing" gather but a meet, greet, and <br/>
exchange.  There is one box there, though, and there are drive bys <br/>
close by.  I especially hope to meet new local boxers.  <br/>
<br/>
I come early and grab a bunch of tables in the back.  We exchange, <br/>
eat, and talk box.  Some carving techniques might be shown.  Rumor <br/>
has it there may be a mystery dinner.  Who knows.  <br/>
<br/>
Last year 30 people showed up, and 6 event stamps.  (Just one event <br/>
stamp? Pshaw. There may be a new traveling event stamp introduced.) <br/>
Some came to the dinner and not the gather and vice versa.  <br/>
<br/>
It's always possible that the date might change, like if I find out <br/>
there's Geocache meet there that day.  More later.<br/>
