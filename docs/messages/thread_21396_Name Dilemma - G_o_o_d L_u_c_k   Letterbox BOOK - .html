<br/>
I need some help in this situation. The Name "Good Luck" was already<br/>
taken and a few times in  phrases.  The letterbox book in the local<br/>
library now has a "good luck"  (Chinese) stamp in it. Wanted to call it<br/>
the "Good Luck" letterbox book but the name was already given to a<br/>
letterbox so it's now called " G_o_o_d L_u_c_k " letterbox book  Is that<br/>
ok.???? <br/>
<br/>
Are letterboxes not equal TO  LETTERBOX BOOKS or are they the same thing<br/>
with fancy covers?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the name should change with time to something that's more in line<br/>
with where it's at., or the Good Luck  stamp  replaced with something<br/>
else. "Pleasent Dreams"    or   " Peace &amp; Happiness"    Wonder what the<br/>
Chinese symbols for those are?.<br/>
<br/>
Much too complicated will have to sleep on it.   G_o_o_d    L_u_c_K   for<br/>
now.<br/>
