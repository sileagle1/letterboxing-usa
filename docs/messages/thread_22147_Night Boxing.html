&gt;<br/>
&gt;I've been reading this thread with interest.  I feel compelled to chime <br/>
&gt;in...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Night boxing can be very scary and nerve-wracking.  It can be peaceful or <br/>
&gt;exhilarating.  It can be breathtaking (full moon over cliffs above the <br/>
&gt;ocean, full moon on a Hallowe'en night seeking Monster stamps, a moonless <br/>
&gt;night with a Milky Way so bright that it seems to light the ground).  It <br/>
&gt;can be treacherous.  I think if it's planned, then that's half the battle.  <br/>
&gt;But to get yourself caught in the dark without flashlights or enough good <br/>
&gt;batteries on a dark night is, of course, risky.  Dusk, or twilight, can be <br/>
&gt;tricky just because your vision is often not nearly as good as you think, <br/>
&gt;especially depth perception or being able to discern shapes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have night boxed quite a bit more with my boyfriend/fianc/husband than <br/>
&gt;with my former female boxing partner.  If it's on purpose and you have <br/>
&gt;already been to the area and know it, it can be stealthy and fun, <br/>
&gt;especially if you know that authorities will be scolding and threatening <br/>
&gt;you if they find you. <s>  The personality of your teammate and your trust <br/>
&gt;in them are key.  If you or your partner get all sketched out then it won't <br/>
&gt;be fun.  If your partner is great under pressure and very comfortable in <br/>
&gt;woods, has a good sense of direction, etc., then it can be great.  The same <br/>
&gt;person could be really good in a familiar area or if the night boxing is <br/>
&gt;their idea, and a basket case if they get nervous and insecure, or try to <br/>
&gt;move too fast in the dark to GET OUT OF THESE CREEPY WOODS.  And even the <br/>
&gt;best boy scout with a kerosene lantern, a few spare flashlights, and cell <br/>
&gt;phone can get sketched out by snapping twigs and that awful feeling of <br/>
&gt;being someone's or something's idea of possible prey. <shiver><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Most of our night boxing is deliberate and often is because a certain <br/>
&gt;elusive box keeps calling us back to a very familiar place that is normally <br/>
&gt;way too busy with people at other times or because it gets dark early and <br/>
&gt;we want to complete a mission after work.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would love it if all planters and clue writers mentioned *anything* they <br/>
&gt;know or don't know about attempting their box at night.  Local regulations, <br/>
&gt;terrain, etc., are obviously important.  But if you know also that <br/>
&gt;neighbors feel free to set their dogs loose at night regardless of leash <br/>
&gt;laws, or if there are gangs of kids who frequent the place at night, those <br/>
&gt;would be good things to mention.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Safari Woman<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;PS I have positive and negative feelings about lanterns.  They are warm and <br/>
&gt;light the way. They scare away animals. They draw insects. They are <br/>
&gt;dangerously hot and can melt your rain gear or fry your skin. They alert <br/>
&gt;neighbors and authorities to your presence and whereabouts. The glass <br/>
&gt;globes are fragile and the fuel can be smelly and flammable in your car. <br/>
&gt;They can make things seem safe and warm, but can throw shadows that will <br/>
&gt;trigger a vivid imagination.  They have a comforting breath that sounds <br/>
&gt;like a hush but sputter and hiss in the rain, or suddenly sound a little <br/>
&gt;too much like Darth Vader. <s>  Flashlights with extra batteries and bulbs <br/>
&gt;are stealthier and safer, but it can be really weird when three or four <br/>
&gt;stop working, one right after the other, in a creepy place like an <br/>
&gt;abandoned fort.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Last month, Rosie River Cat and I did some night boxing while we were<br/>
&gt;   attending the Boyds gathering in Maryland.  What a great time we had!<br/>
&gt;   I had lined up a group of boxes that I thought looked pretty easy and<br/>
&gt;   we did some of those although I truly believe that it took twice as<br/>
&gt;   long to do them in the dark as it would have in daylight.  We found<br/>
&gt;   out a few things from doing this.  First, take a lantern or wear a<br/>
&gt;   headlamp, it is impossible to hold a flashlight while you stamp in.<br/>
&gt;   Second, leave a light of some sort out on the trail while stamping in.<br/>
&gt;   Things look very different at night and finding the trail again when<br/>
&gt;   you are finished with the box is not the easiest thoing to do.  Next,<br/>
&gt;   don't go alone.  I often box alone but I don't think I would want to<br/>
&gt;   do it at night.  And last, there is nothing quite as wonderful as<br/>
&gt;   being the only ones in the woods with the moon lighting your way.  It<br/>
&gt;   was almost spiritual in its beauty.  I highly recommend trying it<br/>
&gt;   although I don't think it is something that I would make a habit of <br/>
&gt;doing.<br/>

<br/>
I think that as far as your cell phone goes, I'd guess that its GPS ability means that if you call 911 and don't know where you are, they could <br/>
find out your location through whatever technology law enforcement has available to them.  That would be very handy if your car is off the road and you have no clue where you are and are injured, etc.  I would think that if you are really lost and in any kind of danger, they'd find you. (Provided that satellite communication to your cell is not impaired by cloud cover or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
If you carry a GPS receiver (or is it actually a transceiver?) and know how to use it, that would be great.  I don't own one but they should be able to help you retrace your steps and if you were in danger, you could use your cell to call someone with the coordinates from your own GPS unit.  Still, there are variables. I have been in places where there is NO cell coverage, or it's so limited that just a little movement of your head will drop the call.  So even with all the electronic gadgets, you could be out in the cold depending upon battery power, position, terrain, and weather.<br/>
<br/>
But I'm thinking that there may be repercussions if you need to use law enforcement or emergency services to find you and  they feel that you were careless, negligent, breaking park curfew, or otherwise culpable for getting yourselves into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
But for some, the unknown and the ability to (hopefully) take care of themselves is part of the thrill.  <s>  Risky business.  I have a nephew who <br/>
hikes the Sierra Nevadas alone, the "back country" of the national parks he has worked in (again, alone), and has gone  to remote areas in Indonesia and Australia by himself without a single piece of electronic equipment.  He's never gotten lost or hurt, to my knowledge. I have to respect that, but I wouldn't go to my local park without my cell and/or my FRS (walkie talkie). Heck, I always make sure I have my cell with me when I take my walks around the neighborhood during my lunch break at work.  You just never know if you'll twist an ankle or get confronted by a loose, unfriendly dog...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone who knows a little more about GPS enabled phones and how they are used to find missing or hurt people could chime in, or you might find more info on-line at a "how things work" site if you are really curious about what use your phone is if you are really lost out in the woods.<br/>

Hi Mary,<br/>
Please see subject line. This gives the appearance that it is <br/>
addressed  to newboxers. I have no problem with anyone that has been <br/>
letterboxing for a while to do whatever they want to seek <br/>
letterboxes. I only have a problem with the way the subject line is <br/>
set up. It gives the impression that newboxers might want to <br/>
consider night boxing. My post only mentions that some caution be <br/>
exercised in any encouragement to those ends.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 &gt;I think that you should read through the thread on [newboxers], <br/>
&gt;which I had inadvertently posted to the main list.  I apologize for <br/>
&gt;that.  I was unaware that I had done so until someone pointed it <br/>
&gt;out to me. This was a mix-up on my part due to switching between OE <br/>
&gt;and Yahoo based replies.<br/>
<br/>
I did read through the thread on the newboxers list, and feel the <br/>
same way. Night boxing should be discouraged or atleast not <br/>
encouraged for new letterboxers. If you would read my posts on the <br/>
newboxer list you will find that I advised that we too have some <br/>
night time boxes that indicate that they would be available at <br/>
night. We make sure that it is very clear in our clues and only list <br/>
that information when we are positive that a finder is not at any <br/>
undo risk.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But you should realize, too, that lots of people do night boxing, <br/>
&gt;some because they choose and some by mistake.  The point is to be <br/>
&gt;as prepared as you can be for the experience.<br/>
<br/>
Just because "lots of people do night boxing" doesn't make it a good <br/>
idea for a recommendation to a new boxer.I think it would be a <br/>
better idea to generally advise against it. Some folks may think <br/>
that night boxing is wonderful, and that is just great----for them. <br/>
I just have problems with encouragement for something that could <br/>
turn very negative for someone that could be a little naive. <br/>
Preparation is a great idea and that is why I directed newboxers to <br/>
the links at AQ.<br/>
I don't care if someone chooses to do something that puts them at <br/>
risk, I am only concerned about a potential recommendation for <br/>
others that may not understand the risk. I think most of your posts <br/>
are informative but would be better served, by a different subject <br/>
line.<br/>
