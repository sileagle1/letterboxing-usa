<div>Tom,</div>
<div>    At the Letterboxing Gathering 
in May I mentioned to you that I had put out a "Parasite" box in Rhode 
Island that was already on the move to Connecticut.  I have put another one 
out and have seen one that Jay put out on 6/7/00.  I thought I would get 
you some info. so maybe we can put them on-line under the mystery clues.  
It is a mystery as to where they are since they travel.  You mentioned that 
we could track their names and where they have been.  Anyway, this is a 
copy of the label I use when I put one out. [This Letterbox is part of a 
"Parasite" series.  A parasite Letterbox attaches itself to 
another existing Letterbox.  When you find one...please take it with you 
and attach it to another "Host" the next time you are out 
Letterboxing.  Because they are constantly moving around, it is imperative 
as the caretaker that I am updated as to their whereabouts.  Please let me 
know: the box name, where you found it, and where you left it at <a href="mailto:sarah.fearing@gte.net">sarah.fearing@gte.net</a>  THANK 
YOU!]  I got the idea from a very brief paragraph on the Dartmoor 
Letterboxes site.</div>
<div>    So far I have placed the Y2K 
Bug at "Blurred Borders #2" on 4/30/2000 and it has already traveled 
to a new mystery site</div>
<div>    I have also placed the 
"Fuzzy Caterpillar" on 6/7/2000 yet to travel</div>
<div>If you need any more info..etc., please let me 
know.</div>

I really like the idea of "Parasite Boxes" although the name has a lot<br/>
to be desired.  Maybe hitchhiking boxes ?  It's probadly just my over<br/>
reaction to a Deer Tick bite.  Anyway I hope we are at the right place<br/>
at the right to get one of those parasites (boxes).<br/>

<br/>
I did a clue a year or so ago called a "cuckoo clue".  The idea was that<br/>
the clue (not the box) traveled from box to box and you stamped the clue<br/>
with your stamp and the stamp in the box that you were placing the clue <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
Sort of like: placed in <stamp> by <stamp> on <date><br/>
<br/>
I put three of these out there, and I know at least one has been found.<br/>
I wonder if any of them have a nice long history yet.<br/>

Unless some other letterboxers are going to be any<br/>
closer to Lake Superior than I am, I think that means<br/>
I'm elected.  What exactly did you have in mind?  If<br/>
this is a parasite box in the sense already discussed,<br/>
wouldn't other letterboxers have to move it from my<br/>
initial placement?  I fear that this part of the<br/>
country has few known letterboxers at the moment<br/>
(though plenty of boxes!) and only the Mapsurfer has<br/>
made the trip out here that I know of.<br/>
How about this alternative: start the parasite box out<br/>
east, moving along the Great Lakes, then when it<br/>
reaches Wisconsin, I move it south along the<br/>
Mississippi where someone else takes it.  Eventually<br/>
the box should end up in California and Oregon where<br/>
so many other letterboxers live.<br/>

In addtion to the postcards that could track the box's<br/>

disposable cameras so whoever finds it can take a snap<br/>

Steve:<br/>
The idea of a travelling Letterbox, especially one that sends back notes<br/>
on its progress, is a very attractive concept to me - the reference to<br/>
"Paddle-to-the-Sea" is to a classic kid's book, where a Native American<br/>
youth carves a little canoe with traveler and places it in a snowbank<br/>
that melts into Lake Superior in the spring, thus launching a voyage<br/>
thru the lakes to the St Lawrence, etc. <br/>
<br/>
A few years back, the kids in our local elementary school made a<br/>
slightly larger version, (by the same name, even!) and left it on the<br/>
side of the road with a sign. AS I recall, it did make it to the West<br/>
coast, with lots of post cards back from the kind folks giving it a<br/>
life.  The note-in-a-bottle tossed overboard to the whims of life is a<br/>
powerful metaphore. <br/>
<br/>
I'd almost like to put a little "box-cam" into a travelling letterbox to<br/>
see where it goes. Thus, at least, the postcards idea, as the next best<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Following on your go-west theme, perhaps a Horace Greely Box, or maybe,<br/>
a '49er gold rush box. Wouldn't it be great to see one actually cross<br/>
the country?<br/>

    I remember that your Butler Island box had post cards in it and how cool<br/>
that was.  That is a really cool idea and may help me keep track of the<br/>
boxes if someone isn't computer savvy and can't e-mail me.  Thanks for the<br/>
tip.  Hope to get to Vermont again sometime soon and maybe meet for coffee,<br/>
etc.  I've sent for the Valley Quest, as I've done most of the other Vermont<br/>
boxes.  Vermont better watch out for those parasites they spread fast.<br/>
