<div>Well, it's a long way from Tallahassee, but we just 
planted a north FL letterbox in Duval County (Jacksonville, for those of you not 
from Florida).</div>

Too bad about the Pinellas County box. I think it was planted by <br/>
someone from out of state so it may not be possible to easily verify <br/>
it's disappearance for sure. I was planning on heading over there to <br/>
look pretty soon, but maybe I'll try elsewhere now that there are <br/>
finally  a few other boxes in Florida besides my own. Looking forward <br/>
to more in the future!<br/>

<div>Denise.....   I stamped into the Fort 
Dosoto box on Easter Sunday and I feel like it was far enough off the trail not 
to be stumbled upon. I wonder if you were in the right place????   
Maybe you better head south to my 5 boxes in Ft. Myers area....  Have fun 
and good luck</div>
