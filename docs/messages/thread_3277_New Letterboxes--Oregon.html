                    <div class="plaintext-content">This weekend the YaYa Girls had a rendezvous at Camp Sherman, Jefferson<br/>
County, Oregon. The group came from locales as diverse as Chicago,<br/>
Australia and Portland. We celebrated our friendship by planting The<br/>
YaYa Letterboxes along the Metolius River. These are the clues to our<br/>
four works of art placed September 7-9, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead for the Camp Sherman and Night and Day Letterboxes:<br/>
Take route 20 to the turnoff for Camp Sherman 12 miles west of Sisters,<br/>
Oregon. Go North and park at the Camp Sherman store.<br/>
<br/>
To the Letterboxes:<br/>
Night and Day Letterbox:  Walk downstream on the East Metolius Trail.<br/>
You will pass a campground and a wooden bench.  When the trail meets a<br/>
pullout on the road, you will see a single Ponderosa Pine on the left.<br/>
Continue 33 paces.  You will pass Siamese Twins.  Just beyond them is a<br/>
small rotting tree stump on your left.  The letterbox is resting quietly<br/>
beneath broken wood and pine needles.  This is a fifteen minute walk<br/>
from the Camp Sherman store; letterbox created by YumYum YaYa.<br/>
Camp Sherman Letterbox:  Walk upstream to the head of the Metolius<br/>
River.  After reveling in the amazement of a full blown river springing<br/>
from the earth, and being charmed by the incredibly cute rodent<br/>
population, head back to the parking lot.  Forty-five paces beyond the<br/>
end of the rail fence on the exit road, take the trail at 300 degrees<br/>
(magnetic.)  Keep the barbed wire fence and power lines on your left.<br/>
Stop at the green metal gate.  At 110 degrees you will see a stump.<br/>
Walk 46 paces and slide out the removable door.  Stamp in, please!  This<br/>
is a 50 minute walk from the Camp Sherman store; letterbox created by<br/>
Eco YaYa.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead for the Metolius River and Black Butte Letterboxes:<br/>
Take Route 20 to the turnoff for Camp Sherman 12 miles west of Sisters,<br/>
Oregon. Go North to the junction with Forest Service Road 1420.<br/>
Continue straight on 1420 to Lower Canyon Creek Campground.  Park at the<br/>
West Metolius Trailhead and head for Wizard Falls.<br/>
<br/>
Black Butte Letterbox:  Walk downstream on the West Metolius Trail to<br/>
the first cedar tree on the right side of the path.  Just ahead of you<br/>
will be a large Ponderosa Pine on the left, with a fallen friend just<br/>
beyond.  Go behind the live one and look beneath the fallen one for your<br/>
stamp.  This is a five minute walk; letterbox created by Yowah YaYa.<br/>
Metolius River Letterbox:<br/>
After youve toured the hatching tanks,<br/>
go back upstream and cross two planks.<br/>
Just beyond them you will see,<br/>
the greyed remains of a sawn off tree.<br/>
He gazes out from two eyes,<br/>
and stands just under five feet in size.<br/>
In the place of curly locks,<br/>
You will find this letterbox<br/>
This is a two and a half mile walk; letterbox created by YeeHa YaYa.<br/>
(NOTE:  Both the Camp Sherman and Metolius River letterboxes have<br/>
shorter hiking alternatives.  Please consult your map.)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>
