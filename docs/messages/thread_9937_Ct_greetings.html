I just want to give a hugh Thanks to all the folks that have planted<br/>
boxes. I have hiked the Blue Trails of Ct. for many years and since<br/>
beganning to letterboxing a little over a year ago, I have had such<br/>
pleasure in finding the lovely preserves and small parks that play host<br/>
to boxes. We live in a beautiful State and show off our treasures to all<br/>
who wish to search out a letterbox.  So many new friends have enriched<br/>
my life and brought joy and laughter along as we hike and squeal when we<br/>
find our prize.<br/>
As Bluebird and I drove home from a day of boxing which ended with a<br/>
warm cup of cocoa at The Leader of the Pack's home, we figured we have<br/>
walked hundreds of miles together and are pushing a BIG number if we add<br/>
our finds, plants, HH and X's  The numbers astound me, but the joy of<br/>
hiking and boxing with friends is the very best.<br/>
Thanks to all and Happy New Year.<br/>

Are you the 'Joe' who hit my new letterbox ("Christmas Eve on Flatbrook") on<br/>
Christmas Day?<br/>
<br/>
If so, I thought I'd add - our family is totally new to this.  We've been<br/>
boxing for about 6 months and I share your sentiments exactly.  We love to<br/>
hike, find new parks and trails to walk, and the boxing is fun.<br/>
<br/>
We've been hiking to this waterfall spot for about 2 years and when we<br/>
learned about boxing we thought it would be a good place for one.<br/>
<br/>
Any additional comments about the box?<br/>
