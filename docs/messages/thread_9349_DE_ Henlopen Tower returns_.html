                    <html><body>   The Henlopen Tower (Delaware) letterbox has been restored to its original hiding place for all you boxers who may be crawling around the Cape over Thanksgiving.  <b>Webmasters: Please reinstate the existing clue as of 11/24/02.  </b>Thanks again to  Firefly, who retrieved it for us, and to others who offered to help with the rescue.  <br/>
    While on our mission to Cape Henlopen State Park, we found the other Cape Henlopen letterbox, which was being visited by The Tramp HH.  He has been sent on his way.  We also enjoyed finding the two Gordon's Pond letterboxes (Gordon's Pond and Sounds of Sirens).  All the boxes were in good shape; we replaced one torn baggie.  The beach and park were beautiful this weekend, although a little windy.  No mosquitoes in November!<br/>
