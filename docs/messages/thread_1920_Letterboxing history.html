<div>Thanks, Graham, for the input.  We are 
impressed that anything so new, to most of us, is at once so venerable.  
And do I hear, "Dartmoor in '04" as a rallying cry ?!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Howdy all -<br/>
Just an exciting bit of history for you folks. Today I met David <br/>
Sobel, author and educator from Antioch New England Graduate School <br/>
in New Hampshire. He authored an article that many of you might <br/>
recognize on QUESTING. As he told me today, the article spurred <br/>
interest from the author who then wrote the article in the <br/>
Smithsonian magazine and that received much press. Sobel seemed to <br/>
have had an integral part in bringing letterboxing/questing to <br/>
classrooms in Vermont, Connecticut, and perhaps yours!<br/>
<br/>
He is giving a free lecture this evening in Portland, Maine in <br/>
conjunction with a workshop this week on how to transform your school <br/>
grounds into outdoor green spaces. Those of you with children might <br/>
be interested in reading his "Mapmaking with Children" book that <br/>
really fits well with the notion of outdoor learning and play spaces <br/>
as well as with mapmaking. FUN! <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how much Sobel had a direct part in bringing <br/>
letterboxing into the classroom and/or general public, but I like to <br/>
think that more people will catch onto this idea. It was really just <br/>
a shameless plug for letterboxing to my group during the workshop - <br/>
but given the context it was perfect!!<br/>
<br/>
Ok - that's all! Just wanted to share some letterboxing history with <br/>
you. Hope everyone is enjoying this fine summer weather. <br/>
