Knights of Columbo going - me, myself and our son.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the question on names - we don't have individual code type <br/>
names, but decided on a group one.  Knights because we all enjoy <br/>
things medieval and to capture the UK feel for my husband.  Columbo <br/>
and a play on the word "night" because we all curl up to watch the <br/>
old Columbo movies when they're on at night. : )<br/>

Shell : )<br/>

&gt;      I have a correction, not the Knights of Columbo, I meant <br/>
&gt; justplaingeorge. Although they are invited too. Heck everyone can <br/>
&gt; come to this shindig! So far it looks like a lot of women, poor <br/>
boy!!!<br/>
&gt; Scarab and Newbi better attended so Ryan doesn't feel henpecked!<br/>
&gt;      So far the dates picked for Ryan's EDA are:<br/>
&gt;      Hiker     June 10<br/>
&gt;      Psychomommy    13<br/>
&gt;      Tammy ADG#1    14<br/>
&gt;      Sam I AM       15<br/>
&gt;   Place your bets: wages are up to individuals, and only if you <br/>
feel <br/>
&gt; like it. For example I chose food.<br/>
&gt;      Psychomommy<br/>

&gt; &gt; Columbo, Mary daughter of Old Dominium, Princess T and of course <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; will be eagerly waiting with care packages&gt;<br/>
