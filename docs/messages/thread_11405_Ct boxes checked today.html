Mansfield Trails for winter damage and  checking the respective <br/>
letterboxes on each trail. I'm waiting for reports from all the <br/>
different teams but my team of four boys age 9 and myself  Checked on <br/>
the boxes at Merrow Meadow. The Wizards were all in great shape I've <br/>
waited all winter for them.  The original box is fine . The special  <br/>
birthday 8 box is missing and believed gone. Someone moved it from <br/>
it's original place to a new one  and the owners couldn't find it <br/>
from that revision. We hope it will be replaced soon.  We did note <br/>
some  missing signs and a blow down that needs sawing so we will send <br/>
our report off to the park dept.  Teach and Preach we were there late <br/>
afternoon and followed your signature all the way!  A beautiful day <br/>
out and now quarters to pick up all over the area ! Thanks. <br/>
