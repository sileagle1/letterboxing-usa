emailed Cara at her hotmail account and she emailed me right back.  <br/>
She is in medical school now and very busy.  I emailed her back <br/>
asking for any other clues to her boxes and if she would like to <br/>
have Maiden1974 (or myself) caretake her series for her and forward <br/>
her the filled logbooks, keep clues updated etc.  I am still waiting <br/>
to hear back from her - when I do I will let the list know first as <br/>
these stamps have been hidden for a very long time and are cool <br/>
stamps!  I am proud to have this one in my book!<br/>
