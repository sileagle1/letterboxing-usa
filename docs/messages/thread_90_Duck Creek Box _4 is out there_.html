<br/>
Letterbox 4 in Garland,TX  USA<br/>
<br/>
GPS Readings<br/>
32 degrees 57'10N<br/>
096 degrees 43'56W<br/>
<br/>
 *   pleasant walk from parking lot to letterbox<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:<br/>
Take LBJ Freeway (635) to Garland.<br/>
Exit at Oates Road, go east.<br/>
When you get to a stop light at O'Bannion where you see a sign that reads<br/>
Audubon Park and Wave Pool, turn right.  Follow the road past the Audubon<br/>
Park Rec center and Surf and Swim Wave Pool.  It will twist behind those<br/>
buildings to your left.  Follow it past parking areas first near playground<br/>
equipment, next past picnic tables.  Then it will curve back to the right.<br/>
Follow it to a small parking area on your RIGHT (pass the one on your left)<br/>
that faces some picnic structures.  Park.  After you get out of your car,<br/>
turn your back on the structures.  You are facing the paved trail you want<br/>
to be on.<br/>
	Walk across the grass to it and turn to your left.  Soon you will<br/>
go under the overpass that carries car traffic.  When you come out on the<br/>
other side, the paved trail forks.  Take the fork that goes off to your<br/>
right.  It curves around to a bench and shortly after that you'll see a<br/>
meadow.  Walk past it, counting about 350 paces from the bench, then look<br/>
to your right. Very near the paved trail, you'll see three skinny trees,<br/>
three stumps, and a couple of broken trees that sort of form a<br/>
ring...within the ring leaves hide what you seek.<br/>

Want to buy a book?  I'm trying to make a life-long dream come true and<br/>
open a bookshop.  It's tiny, but it grows now and then.  Come see!<br/>
