                    <div class="plaintext-content">On September 17-18, 2002 Funhog placed the Coyote Creek Letterboxes (HC) in San Jose, Santa Clara <br/>
County, California. This is an easy stroll, about two miles roundtrip, along a preserved riparian area. The <br/>
trail is suitable for both walkers and bike riders.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: <br/>
from Highway 101 south of downtown San Jose take the Yerba Buena exit. Turn right on Yerba Buena. <br/>
Shortly you will come to the bridge over Coyote Creek. Immediately after crossing the bridge, turn right <br/>
on Grandbrook and park.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox:<br/>
Zig zag your way down the hill, beneath the bridge, along the rill.<br/>
Young sycamores, pale and grey, line the path along the way.<br/>
Wend upstream along creek ashining, past velodrome, al fresco dining.<br/>
Feet on pavement, cross the flow. Turn left offroad, uphill you go.<br/>
Count the steps, twenty two, a letterbox waits for you.<br/>
Beneath branch and boulder you must look to find a cozy little nook.<br/>
<br/>
Back to road, you'll spot a trail, peddles and wheels along the swale.<br/>
Walk until you pass a pond, The Royal Road just beyond.<br/>
At the crossroads halt your stroll, uphill sycamores, a hidey-hole.<br/>
Search the first tree that you reach, poison shrubs beyond hard lessons teach.<br/>
<br/>
note:  HC denotes a hand carved stamp<br/>
