list.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it was the first group I joined, ever.  LBNA pointed me to this list.  I found it helpful in <br/>
many ways about the mechanics of letterboxing and yahoo groups.  Now I am feeling it no <br/>
longer serves that purpose.<br/>
<br/>
I joined my regional LBGLK group, newboxers and travellers groups too.  I joined Atlas <br/>
Quest.  Any questions I have are easily answered on these other lists and in a more <br/>
pleasant atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
It seems this list has become a list with attitude, maybe mirroring our society.  We have <br/>
become fractured in so many ways and we have forgotten how to be civil ALL the time.  I <br/>
really try to remember to that it's not about me, and that I am responsible for my <br/>
reactions.<br/>
<br/>
So, if I drop off this list, just look for me elsewhere.  I will not surrender my love of <br/>
letterboxing and making new friendships.<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I also share the same sentiment.  I don't respond or even read this list as much as the LBNE list.  Though, I haven't read any of the posts from the subject in question, this list gets too flared up easily.<br/>
<br/>
I too will never give up letterboxing (without a fight that is ;-)... for those of you who know me, between auto accidents and a "non-boxing" boyfriend, you know what I mean ;-), but leaving this list may be the right idea.<br/>
