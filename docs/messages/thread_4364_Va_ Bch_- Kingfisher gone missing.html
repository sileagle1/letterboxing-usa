Guess it's time to start carving and placing....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Amy, Thanks for the update on Kingfisher. I took a little run out <br/>
there today to verify your findings. I'm sad to report that it is in <br/>
fact missing. I've had problems with animals disturbing that one in <br/>
the past. I changed containers hoping that would make a difference. <br/>
It seemed to work. It was undisturbed for almost a year. Wish I knew <br/>
for sure if it was an animal or human that took it. Hopefully someone <br/>
found it disturbed and has been trying to notify me. My email address <br/>
has changed from the one I had in the log book. If that's the case <br/>
and you're reading this, please contact me via the group. I will <br/>
remove it from my web page and notify the webmasters to remove it <br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Mark<br/>
