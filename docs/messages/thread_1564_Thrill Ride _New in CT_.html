<br/>
Thrill Ride<br/>
<br/>
A single letterbox piggy backed onto the three boxes planted by the <br/>
ESAK family on the Tunxis Trail overlooking the Lake Compounce <br/>
amusement park in Southington, CT. For the clues to the Fish Head, <br/>
Marble Rock, and Jullian's Rock letterboxes, see:<br/>
<br/>
www.letterboxing.org/ma/fishhead.htm<br/>
<br/>
This is a very scenic (and steep) hike that will carry you up a <br/>
lovely streamside trail to terrific views. Figure 2 1/2 miles and 2 <br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
First, find the Fish Head and Marble Rock letterboxes per the ESAK <br/>
directions. After climbing to ESAK's first "sizable bald granite <br/>
summit with a log bench" and following the "narrow, twisting, easy <br/>
path," come to a T-intersection. Turn to 030 and walk to a <br/>
smooth-rocked, east-facing overlook with expansive views. Follow the <br/>
blue trail a short way downhill. On the right you'll see a knee high <br/>
chunk of stone with an overhanging lip on its' eastern face. There <br/>
are a couple of small white birch trees in the foreground. Walk <br/>
gently across the moss and find the Thrill Ride letterbox tucked into <br/>
the rocks' south-facing overhang.<br/>
<br/>
Now return up to the T-intersection to find Jullian's Rock.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey Drew Clan, we're glad you liked our letterboxes. Coming from you, <br/>
it is an honor. We have found a few of yours too. You've given us a <br/>
great idea. There is so much great hiking up on this mountain that <br/>
maybe others may hide their letterboxes here too. Perhaps we <br/>
could "string" them together. I know we'll hide more ourselves and <br/>
we look forward to the "Thrill Ride"<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
