                    <div class="plaintext-content">During some down time on a recent trip to Florida, I introduced a friend, <br/>
RichBeau, to letterboxing. (RichBeau is a geocacher, too, so we logged 13 <br/>
geocache finds once we exhausted the local supply of letterboxes that were <br/>
available to us as time and distance allowed.) Here's a report on the <br/>
letterboxes we found:<br/>
<br/>
Disney Series -- We found all three with no trouble -- Caribbean Beach, <br/>
Celebration, Wilderness Lodge. A large owl watched us as we logged in to <br/>
the Wilderness Lodge box, which was cool.<br/>
<br/>
Seven from the Florida Ancients -- We headed up to Deland and tackled this <br/>
series of seven boxes in a great little park. The trail was submerged in <br/>
several places, but we managed to find our way through it and the letterbox <br/>
series -- backwards. We startled a woodpecker on the path, and he flew to <br/>
the safety of a tall pine and yelled at us. Unfortunately, #5 and #6 are <br/>
missing (some others had noted this in the logs in other boxes in the <br/>
series). Worse:<br/>
<br/>
#1, Swamp Owl, was open and filled with water.<br/>
<br/>
#3, Clay Acorn, was wet throughout.<br/>
<br/>
#4, Clay Fox, was open and strewn about the ground. Some of the log and <br/>
papers were chewed up, so it looked like a raccoon may have gotten to the box.<br/>
<br/>
#2, Clay Dog, and #7, Clay Deer, were both in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
A storm arrived about halfway through our hike, with winds and rain falling <br/>
as the temperature fell. We carried on, though, and dried out and rebagged <br/>
the wet boxes as best we could. (I'll email the box owner with a report on <br/>
these boxes.)<br/>
<br/>
As we arrived at the park, one of the rangers saw RichBeau poking at his <br/>
GPS, and told us he had plotted the coordinates of the entire park, so he <br/>
gave us a map with his longitude &amp; latitude bearings. Then he also pulled <br/>
out a notebook filled with large color photos of much of the wildlife and <br/>
fauna found in the park. It was a great introduction to the local ecosystem <br/>
(and also helped us learn about the poisonous snakes of the area, knowledge <br/>
that we fortunately never needed to use).<br/>
<br/>
When we completed the trek, we arrived back at the park office to find that <br/>
the park's volunteer team was hosting a barbecue, and they invited us to <br/>
have some bbq chicken, cole slaw, smoked sausage, pork, baked beans and <br/>
homemade chocolate sheet cake. Since we were we pretty well soaked through <br/>
by now, from both the rain and the swamps, we eagerly dug in to the <br/>
delicious grub. It was a nice ending to this adventure.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed back into DeLand, but the Cor Libri and Soda Jerk <br/>
letterboxes were both unavailable this Sunday afternoon.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Silent Doug and RichBeau, for the report and re-bagging the <br/>
Ancients.  I did get a report on the Bannerstone (#5) from boxers who found <br/>
the log on the trail, but nothing else.  They were going to mail it to my <br/>
husband.  Village Hut was lost at some point last year, so I carved a new <br/>
stamp and relocated it, but you are the second party to tell me it was gone, <br/>
so I guess the new one (planted Dec. 28) is lost as well - but I'll check <br/>
the website just in case the clue changes didn't get through.<br/>
<br/>
The BBQ people you ate with are my friends from the volunteer corps. Great <br/>
people, aren't they?<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, the fate of the Seven Ancients and other DeLand boxes is <br/>
uncertain.  I don't live there anymore, and don't plan on going back.<br/>
<br/>
Did you find the Nekkid Redneck?<br/>

<br/>
Nope, but we didn't try -- our time was up and we needed to get back to the <br/>
airport -- and back to the snowstorms of the Northeast, as it turns out.<br/>
<br/>
Since you don't live there anymore, maybe you could note on the clue pages <br/>
for the Deland boxes that they're orphans. Someone might be able to adopt <br/>
them, or could do maintenance when they searched for them. They did get <br/>
quite a bit of traffic, so there are letterboxers in the area, it seems.<br/>
