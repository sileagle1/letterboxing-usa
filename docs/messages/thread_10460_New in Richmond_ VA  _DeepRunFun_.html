Difficulty:  Very easy walk in the woods<br/>
Dogs on leash okay.<br/>

Things to do in Deep Run Park...#1 SOCCER<br/>
<br/>
Follow main road into park to the soccer fields.  At the SW corner of <br/>
the parking lot, begin paved trail to the right of the Castle <br/>
Playground.  At the T-intersection go right onto unpaved trail.  <br/>
Cross footbridge, following trail through woods...the soccer fields <br/>
will be on your right.  At fork go right.  As you see the end of the <br/>
trail leading onto the soccer fields, notice the last double trunk <br/>
tree on your right.  Follow a straight path directly east (90 <br/>
degrees) into the woods until a hollow tree stump blocks your path.  <br/>
Hidden inside the hollow stump is the Soccer Fun Stamp.  Rehide and <br/>
cover well, as the stump is shallow and the box very visible if not <br/>
disguised.<br/>
<br/>
Watch for more fun things to do in Deep Run Park, but in the <br/>
meantime, have a "Food Fight" by Boxitup!<br/>
