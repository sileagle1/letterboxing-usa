<br/>
In Yancey County, in western North Carolina, there are 18 peaks over 6,000' <br/>
in elevation, including Mt. Mitchell, which is the highest peak in North <br/>
America east of the Rockies.<br/>
<br/>
Here are letterbox clues for the first three in the Highest Eastern Peaks <br/>
series.  For all three, please remember this is often the windiest, coldest <br/>
place in the eastern U.S., even in midsummer.  Temperature changes may be <br/>
sudden and extreme; dress appropriately.  If you are not an experienced <br/>
hiker, do not try Craig and Big Tom alone.<br/>
<br/>
ONE<br/>
Dr. Elisha Mitchell, 6,684'<br/>
Planted 9/29/01<br/>
Yancey County<br/>
nearest town: Burnsville<br/>
Distance: real, real short; a matter of feet.<br/>
Difficulty: real, real easy<br/>
You might need a flashlight and a poking stick.<br/>
Park.<br/>
Walk around behind the museum.<br/>
Notice what seems to be a path to the left, but isn't.<br/>
Slide down into the non-path between the trees onto pine needles.<br/>
Notice old drain pipes on the left.<br/>
Notice two groups of rocks ahead and to the right, with a small cleft <br/>
between them.<br/>
Find your prize under the flattest rock in the left rock group.  (Glad you <br/>
have that flashlight?)<br/>
<br/>
TWO<br/>
Governor Locke Craig, 6,648'<br/>
Planted 9/29/01<br/>
Yancey County<br/>
nearest town: Burnsville<br/>
Distance: about 1/2-3/4 mile<br/>
Difficulty: clues easy, trail strenuous!  Wear hiking boots; carry water; do <br/>
not hike alone if inexperienced.<br/>
You might need a flashlight and a poking stick.<br/>
Hike toward Mt. Craig.<br/>
When you see the brown sign that reads "Notice Hikers and Backpackers: <br/>
(etc.)," STOP.<br/>
While facing the sign, look behind it and up the slope about 15 feet to a <br/>
tree.  To the left of that tree there is a narrow mossy rock ledge.  Use <br/>
your flashlight and/or poking stick to retrieve your treasure.<br/>
As you proceed to Big Tom, you'll see the Craig plaque with the wrong <br/>
elevation noted!<br/>
<br/>
THREE<br/>
Big Tom Wilson, 6,581'<br/>
Planted 9/29/01<br/>
Yancey County<br/>
nearest town: Burnsville<br/>
Distance: about 3/4+ mile<br/>
Difficulty: clues easy, trail strenuous, but most of that's behind you.<br/>
Pass Governor Craig.<br/>
When you see where the plaque isn't, climb over it to USGS marker.<br/>
Slide off rock to left of marker.<br/>
Press the right side of your right leg against the rock you just slid down.<br/>
Hold your right arm straight out at your side pointing at the marker.<br/>
Hold your left arm straight out at your side.<br/>
Your left arm is pointing at the tree whose roots are sheltering Big Tom's <br/>
box.<br/>
