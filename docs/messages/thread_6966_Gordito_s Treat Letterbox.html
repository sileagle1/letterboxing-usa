     Hola Amigos!<br/>
<br/>
     This is our first letterbox, which we have chosen to name for <br/>
our Lil'Bandito gato, Gordito, who loves nothing more than eating.  <br/>
One of Gordito's favorite treats is the subject of this letterbox!  <br/>
Your treat will be the wonderful, panoramic views you will find upon <br/>
completing the sustained 2.7 mile climb necessary to reach your <br/>
goal.  <br/>
     Gordito's Treat lies atop the highest peak of un estado yanqui, <br/>
named for el oso.  From the location marked by Senor Travis, head to <br/>
the no camping zone and pass through the corridor of lovely, <br/>
fragrant, southwestern-looking pine trees.  Proceed up slabs of rock <br/>
and follow a worn path of slabs and pine until you reach a lookout <br/>
with tri-state views.  Step off the edge and follow the blueberry <br/>
lane.  Upon reaching a clearing, you will notice a lonesome pine to <br/>
your right and a small boulder to your left, which looks as if it <br/>
should hide a letterbox.  It doesn't, but.........<br/>
     Continuing on rock slabs, pass the lonesome pine and proceed to <br/>
a fire pit.  Move forward on your rocky way, past many small oak <br/>
trees, to a pair of white birchlings on your left.  Now for the fun <br/>
amigos!!!  Follow the worn path to your right to a large, flat, slab <br/>
of rock, where you seem to be surrounded by brush.  Slightly to your <br/>
left you will spot a relatively large, multi-trunked, maple.  This is <br/>
your destination muchachos!  Make your way over bush and slab  to a <br/>
large overhanging boulder at the tree's base.  What you are looking <br/>
for, sparkles beneath.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck Amigos!<br/>
