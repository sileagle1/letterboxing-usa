regional groups -- hearing the gathering reports from places around <br/>
the country.  So, I thought I would post a brief [ahem] recap of <br/>
Saturday's 3rd Annual Great Lakes Gathering here since all the <br/>
chatter about it has been strictly over at the Great Lakes list.<br/>
<br/>
The gathering, which was held at Hudson-Mills Metropark in Dexter, <br/>
MI, was hosted by Team Rabbit who did an awesome job choosing the <br/>
location.  The park was gorgeous with great open spaces, lush <br/>
forests, a babbling river and lots of trails -- one would never know <br/>
they were only minutes from the suburbia of Ann Arbor.  The weather <br/>
cooperated and we enjoyed pleasant temps without the recent humidity <br/>
and on/off sun all day -- perfect letterboxing weather!<br/>
<br/>
I don't know the actual head count, but there were over 50 people <br/>
signed up to attend and I think they majority of them were there.  <br/>
It was nice to see some old friends (from the previous 2 GL <br/>
Gatherings) and to meet so many new people!  Our special guests were <br/>
Mark &amp; Sue Pepe all of the way from CT!  And as if their presence <br/>
alone was not enough to send us all into fits of letterboxing <br/>
lunacy, Mark brought with him the Boch's Traveling Circus and also <br/>
did a presentation on his trip to Dartmoor last fall.<br/>
<br/>
The Circus was fantastic!  To everyone who contributed stamps, thank <br/>
you for sharing your creativity and talent with all of us!  They <br/>
were all wonderful -- there were a few that just knocked my socks <br/>
off, they were so detailed and precisely cut!  A wonderful bunch of <br/>
stamps!  And for those who will be treated to upcoming performances <br/>
of the circus, a couple of new acts from MI have joined the troupe!<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the plethora of brightly packaged Circus stamps, <br/>
there were several stamps contributed by 'boxers in our region for <br/>
the gathering, based on the theme Mo' Boxin' in Motown.  There was <br/>
everything from classic Motown tunes and singers to sports teams to <br/>
landmarks to industry icons.  My personal favorites were a 4-box <br/>
Detroit Landmarks series done by Team Rabbit (awesome carvings!) and <br/>
the Mo' Mustangs 7-box piece-together series resulting in what else -<br/>
- a Ford Mustang -- done by Dragon.  There were also several WoM <br/>
boxes that had been secretly placed in creative places around the <br/>
gathering area and out on the trails (and I am sure I didn't get <br/>
them all).  OldShoe and I stayed out on that side of the state all <br/>
weekend and went back to the park this morning to hunt down a few <br/>
boxes I didn't have time for on Saturday -- I think I still missed a <br/>
couple!<br/>
<br/>
Mark Pepe's presentation on Dartmoor was a real treat -- I am <br/>
inspired and wanting to know where do I sign up?  In addition there <br/>
were workshops on logbook-making and mystery letterbox clues.  So <br/>
now we are all home sewing hand-made logbooks and figuring / <br/>
creating ciphers and cryptograms and logic puzzles.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in between all of this fun, we found time to enjoy a <br/>
delicious assortment of potluck food, complete with Dragon's yummy <br/>
grilled garlic mushrooms (Dragon was kind of all about 'shrooms and <br/>
pi this year) and some additional social time over lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Wow!  Talk about overload and overwhelmed and overstimulated!  It <br/>
was a busy and long day, but so much fun meeting so many new people <br/>
and enjoying the artistic contributions of so many both near and far.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks especially to Team Rabbit for all of their hard work <br/>
organizing this event and making it such a huge success.  Thanks to <br/>
all who attended and to everyone who contributed their time, their <br/>
skills and their creativity!<br/>
<br/>
Until the next one...<br/>
