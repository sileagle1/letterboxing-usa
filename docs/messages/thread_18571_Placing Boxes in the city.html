If it's a micro try finding a place you can Velcro or attache magnetically<br/>
the film container, or whatever your using, out of site or behind something<br/>
such as a bench or sign of some sort.<br/>
<br/>
If the container is bigger than a film canister, well I'm still working on<br/>
that myself.  Keep at it, don't give up, just my 2cents worth, your mileage<br/>

two film cannisters taped end to end, one side for rolled up log  <br/>
and the other for the stamp.  Be sure it's a dark or camouflage like <br/>
color.<br/>
<br/>
My successful city plantings are in bushes.  I use a long velcro <br/>
strap to tie it to a branch inside the bush.  (Make sure it's an <br/>
evergreen!)  The ones I left on the ground under a bush were got by <br/>
the gardeners.  <br/>
<br/>
Even cities have parks or plantings.  You have to be very clear with <br/>
the directions so they know exactly where to look.  Otherwise they <br/>
could be searching all over and attract attention.<br/>
<br/>
You have to assume the worst in analyzing a location.  If it can be <br/>
seen from any angle it probably won't last.  I have seen many <br/>
placements go missing.  I have had them disappear.  I have had the <br/>
log disappear or the stamp disappear and the box remain.  I have <br/>
replaced a couple.  I have had weird things written in the logs <br/>
probably by a homeless schizophrenic.  If it survives a year you are <br/>
really doing great.<br/>
<br/>
I know of one box that is in the lost &amp; found drawer of a bar, by <br/>
arrangement with the owners.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and feel free to write me directly.<br/>

<br/>
I found a magnetized microbox placed under a shelf in the library.  Some stamp studios also have boxes hidden in them.  Another place would be at the town gazebo.  In one town there is more than one hidden in a used book store and outdoor shopping center.  It can sometimes be difficult to be discreet when finding and replanting.  It's just the nature of the game.  <br/>

    Hmmmmm....... Not sure I'd want to magnetically attach ANYTHING to the underside of a US Mail box. In this day and age......you know what I mean? First of all, the postal service is very territorial about what they consider their property. (That's why you're not supposed to  leave things in your personal mail box for others to pick up if it isn't mail and why paper deliverers aren't supposed to leave your paper in the mail part of a personal mailbox) Second, like I said, in this day and age when people are all a little bit more "aware" of things going on around them, magnetically attaching something under a "government" owned box may look a little suspicious, no?<br/>
  This is of course just my opinion,:) but think there are lots of places to put boxes and believe the official mailboxes should be left alone<br/>
  Anyone agree?   disagree?<br/>

I agree, I have made up my mind to avoid those big blue mailboxes even<br/>
though they make tempting hiding places.  To much room for people to get the<br/>
wrong ideal in this day and age.<br/>
<br/>
On the bright side, it does make hiding an urban box more challenging!<br/>

So far ALL my boxes are urban.  I've placed them under stairs, in <br/>
bushes, under outbuildings, against buildings but covered with rocks <br/>
or pieces of concrete, in cemeteries, in holes in walls, etc.<br/>
<br/>
One is on a university campus right in the middle of the "quad" <br/>
where there are always people even on weekends, and yet several <br/>
people have managed to find it and rehide it.<br/>
<br/>
Microboxes are easiest - 35mm film canisters.  Also, usually go to <br/>
the fringe of where the action is, e.g. the parking lot of an <br/>
attraction.  Also, look for places where the finder can easily <br/>
disguise his actions - for example, he can sit on a step and <br/>
casually bend over to tie a shoe and grab the box.<br/>
<br/>
I've had 2 of 16 go missing.  I think you have to expect that when <br/>
you plant urban, maybe more than trails.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

I have 12 stamps right now (a series, I guess) that are too big for<br/>
micro boxes, but, I will have to get to carving some smaller ones so I<br/>
can go plant in the urban areas =]<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Re: Placing Boxes in the city<br/>

So far ALL my boxes are urban.  I've placed them under stairs, in <br/>
bushes, under outbuildings, against buildings but covered with rocks <br/>
or pieces of concrete, in cemeteries, in holes in walls, etc.<br/>
<br/>
One is on a university campus right in the middle of the "quad" <br/>
where there are always people even on weekends, and yet several <br/>
people have managed to find it and rehide it.<br/>
<br/>
Microboxes are easiest - 35mm film canisters.  Also, usually go to <br/>
the fringe of where the action is, e.g. the parking lot of an <br/>
attraction.  Also, look for places where the finder can easily <br/>
disguise his actions - for example, he can sit on a step and <br/>
casually bend over to tie a shoe and grab the box.<br/>
<br/>
I've had 2 of 16 go missing.  I think you have to expect that when <br/>
you plant urban, maybe more than trails.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

some<br/>

that<br/>
&gt; the everyday person isn't going to see.  Where would one hide a <br/>
box when<br/>
&gt; there is no trail with trees, rocks, dirt and twigs?<br/>
