I wrote a note to the board when I got here about having lost the<br/>

I will send it to you privately<br/>

<br/>
Okay well first of all let me extend my sympathy -- I am scared to death of<br/>
spiders and you just summed up why I always have Iron`Bear stick his hands<br/>
in the holes looking for boxes -- or at least have VERY THICK rubber gloves<br/>
on when I do! After poking around with a stick of course.<br/>
<br/>
Well I will send the Purple Heart your way -- I will probably get it mailed<br/>
out sometime this weekend or early next week at the latest.  Be prepared<br/>
though, my mail seems to be REALLY REALLY slow -- so it may take a little<br/>
while to get there... but rest assured your reward... (if you can call it<br/>
that is in route)<br/>
<br/>
Take care of the hand and avoid spiders but keep on boxing!<br/>
pandora{HIB}<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; That would be me. I got bit by a spider while out<br/>
&gt; checking on a box, and my hand blew up so badly that I<br/>
&gt; couldn't use it for most of a week. The list decided<br/>
&gt; that I was sufficiently injured enough to earn a<br/>
&gt; Purple Heart.<br/>

I'm not sure if this box has its own talk group or tracking site and I can't access yahoo groups from work, so I'm sending this via my email directly to the LbNA list.<br/>
<br/>
Let me add that the stories were interesting and I'm humbled to be in such adventure-seeking, courageous, and mishap-prone company.  My pulled muscle pales in comparison to some of these injuries.  ;-)<br/>
