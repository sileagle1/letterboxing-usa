<div>Had some chances to get out this week.  Found these 
great boxes:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Travel dog</div>
<div>Forest Gnome</div>
<div>Camp 6</div>
<div>Hummingbird</div>
<div>Eagle</div>
<div>Titlow Beach</div>
<div>Heath Farm</div>
<div>WA Territorial Insane Asylum</div>
<div>Olympia Brew House</div>
<div>Tumwater Falls</div>
<div>Chinook</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All are in great shape!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cardweaver had to come all the way from Virginia to be 
first at Heath Farm and the Asylum</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Was first at Olympia Brew House, Tumwater Falls, and 
Chinook.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hadn't been to Camp 6 for a long time.  It is a 
logging museum, with a train and old logging equipment and housing on rails and 
etc.  My great grandfather was a pioneer logger in Grays Harbor County 
around the turn of the century (not this one, the last one).  My 
grandfather, also a logger, had many great stories of logging 'the way it used 
to be'.  Brought back many great memories.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds great!  I'm happy to hear the boxes are doing well.  We had a <br/>
most excellent LB week around Puget Sound, too!<br/>
<br/>
     We found the Titlow Beach, Dash Point Campfire &amp; Seastar/Clam, <br/>
4 of Lincoln Park's 5 (seems slug has slithered away), Camp Long, <br/>
Schmitz Park in reverse (since there's major construction going on <br/>
in the park and you can't get to the beginning of the trail), the <br/>
adorable Little Lord Fauntleroy, Mee Kwa Mooks (the Secret Garden), <br/>
Bridle Trails' 8 new ones (have they been busy there!), St Edward SP <br/>
boxes (gorgeous stamps &amp; neat park with tough hills), Ravenna Parks <br/>
poetic 'Where the Trees Sweep the Stars' (my favorite one), Carkeek <br/>
Park's many LBs (what an awesome park with an incredible playground <br/>
and fab stamps), Fish Tail/Head Mystery (ok, I'm a dunce and missed <br/>
the stairs but we got a great hike around the water and found the <br/>
awesome stamps, to boot--in reverse--doy!!!) and Lake Spanaway's <br/>
Sunset Runner.  Somehow, though, we didn't find any new <br/>
hitchhikers...how can that be?  I guess our first couple of HH finds <br/>
were beginner's luck?  ;)<br/>
     All of these boxes where in great condition--where they were <br/>
missing info sheets I added them but a few were missing pens <br/>
(unfortunately, I didn't have any spares on me).  We're tired and <br/>
are trying to catch up on some sleep.  But, we're 150 miles from <br/>
home right now and sleep will just have to wait...  Priorities, <br/>
right?  ;)  Where will this LB adventure take us next?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail as you (and we) seek new adventures...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dave,  looks like you were just ahead of the Nail Family this week.  <br/>
We stamped in behind you at the Tumwater Falls boxes on Saturday and <br/>
Sunday and you were there before us at the Woodard Bay Pinecone Box <br/>
too.  Not sure but it seems that you, my family, and DVN2RCKR are the <br/>
only active 'boxers in the South Sound.  Too bad with all these new <br/>
boxes in the area.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad you had a good time.  Especially glad you visited Titlow Beach <br/>
even though it is a relatively boring place.<br/>
<br/>
Meet you on the trails,<br/>
<br/>
The Nail Family<br/>
