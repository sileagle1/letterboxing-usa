messages posted while we were away - especially now with Christmas <br/>
cards, cookies and caroling yet to be done!:-) However, a quick scan <br/>
of the list reveals several surprises! Here we thought we might be <br/>
seeing something about Alan and Jonathan's "100-box weekend" ( they <br/>
were mighty close to 50 when we last saw them in Mansfield on the day <br/>
before our departure for Florida!), but what do we find out instead? <br/>
That Chuck's fallen off a cliff!!! And to think that we saw him <br/>
earlier on that very same day, too, and almost went back later at <br/>
dusk to see if they were still there, but figured they'd be long gone <br/>
by then. Little did we know what had befallen! Sorry, Chuck, but glad <br/>
to hear you're O.K. now! Hope for no more serious misadventures in <br/>
the letterboxing community - or in mud, ice or snow either!<br/>
<br/>
On a different note, we're glad to hear about folks reaching special <br/>
milestones, like Josef from E. Hartford hitting the "500 club"! We <br/>
had a feeling back a year ago when he was one of the first people to <br/>
come and do our 8-mile Lil' Rhody Runaround loop, at a time when <br/>
there were already lots of easier boxes to access in the area, that <br/>
he would turn out to be a "serious letterboxer" - and he certainly <br/>
has! It's nice to know that, just as there are different types of <br/>
boxes that appeal to different types of people, there are also a few <br/>
of us out there who just seem to like doing them all - the long,the <br/>
short; the hard,the easy; the single,the multiple; the cute and the <br/>
strange! Hurray for them all!!!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, thanks again to everyone who has been keeping us posted with <br/>
hitcher updates,etc. We obviously have to skip over a lot of what <br/>
goes on here on the list, though, so please just post to us <br/>
personally if there's something immportant we might otherwise miss! <br/>
Hope to see some of you in the New Year - maybe as soon as Jan.18th <br/>
in MA (Thanks, Rustypuff for the open invitation!) Season's Greetings <br/>
and Happy New Year to everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete <br/>
