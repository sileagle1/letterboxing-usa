<br/>
One of mine was impossible to find unless you knew exactly where to look. No letterboxer would have stolen it, so it must have been some official person who took it. <br/>
<br/>
If I replant any boxes in the park, you can bet I will be password protecting the clues (it will be a pain, but if anyone wants to bother going all that way, surely they won't mind the extra effort of sending me an email to find out what the clues are!). <br/>
<br/>
I grew up with that park as practically my backyard. The guardhouse stamp, that guardhouse was on my parents' property for YEARS. The Fort just recently took it back to restore it and put it in the park. The idea that anyone there could be so unfriendly just astonishes me. HMPH. <br/>
<br/>
I must say, though, that the power that be in the State Parks system (namely one Richard Brown) have got their budget stuff seriously screwed up. They are going to spend millions of dollars on a new building (Richard Brown is the head guy on that project and, in fact, I used to work for the architect firm that designed the building) in that park, and the money could happily go to other projects in the park to improve it. :(  <br/>
