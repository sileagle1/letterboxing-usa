this morning and it is "for sure" gone.  I'm sorry about your wild goose <br/>
chase.  <br/>
<br/>
It was one of our very nicest &amp; driest boxes.  :o(<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the Power company replaced a few poles and, even though, <br/>
Blossom's pole wasn't replaced there was evidence of foot traffic and <br/>
clearing...the power company must checked out the condition of the pole and <br/>
have picked it up our Blossom.  It was in a double wide, very nice, ammo box <br/>
.  Hopefully whoever picked it up will open it and follow our directions to <br/>
return it to us.   Atleast the traveling hitchhikers were already picked up <br/>
and sent on their way.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was very disappointed, we will have to try to reassemble Blossom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to "Dreicat" for the heads up, <br/>
