Mouser</div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center">Nubble Light is the most photographed 
Lighthouse in New England. It was built in July 1879. Unique to this tower are 
the miniature cast iron lighthouses atop the posts of the railing on the tower. 
Another interesting character from the history of this lighthouse was 
the Light Mouser who weighed in at 19 lbs and used to love to swim the canal to 
the main land and visit the villagers and swim back across for his mousing 
duties. </div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center">Take Rte 1 through Kittery to York. 
Just after York Zoo you will see signs on the RIGHT for NUBBLE 
LIGHT or CAPE NEDDICK LIGHT. Follow these signs to the light. Be alert 
they are very easy to miss. </div>
<div align="center"> </div>
<div align="center">When you reach the light wander around 
doing the touristy thing. To the far right you will see double binoculars. 
To left of that is a bench in Memory of Marie Kattella. In front of the bench is 
a large rock with a cluster of rocks in front of that. Sit on the lower set of 
rocks (sit on the rock farthest on the right) Bend down to tie your shoe, 
slip your hand under the opening to your left and pull out the box. Please note 
that this is a very small park and is very busy. Be discrete so Nubble and 
the Mouser don't disappear forever.</div>

<div align="center">ENJOY! Keep in touch and let me know 
how it is doing!   </div></body></html>
