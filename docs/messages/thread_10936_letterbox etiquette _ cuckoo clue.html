                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think HH's and cuckoo clues are a bit different than a permanent <br/>
set of clues.  By nature, HH's and cuckoo clues are in one place only <br/>
for a short time, so it is very likely that the box owner wouldn't <br/>
even know they had been there.<br/>
<br/>
If I were doing maintenance on a box and found an unidentified piece <br/>
of paper that I was unsure of, it is quite possible I wouldn't even <br/>
leave it there.  It is obvious when you find a HH hanging out in your <br/>
box -- it is a stamp.  My experience with cuckoo clues is limited <br/>
only to placing them, but I would think they are clearly identified.<br/>
<br/>
While I wouldn't go so far as to say that permisison is required <br/>
before placing a set of permanent clues into another person's box, it <br/>
certainly seems like the best way to go about it, just to make sure <br/>
they are aware and not wondering when they are checking on the box <br/>
and find the clues there.<br/>
<br/>
BTW Eric, a cuckoo clue is a clue to a permanent letterbox that is <br/>
not published, rather the clue is located inside another letterbox <br/>
and moved from box to box in the same way as a hitch hiker, by the <br/>
last person to find it.  They are elusive and mysterious and the <br/>
specifics are limited only by your imagination -- some are simply a <br/>
piece of paper with a clue on, others are in the form of a log book, <br/>
which you would then stamp in and out of a box in the same way as a <br/>
hitch hiker.  Some ask you to relocate them within another box in the <br/>
same series or park, others can be relocated anywhere, even in <br/>
another part of the country!    <br/>

&gt; A few folks have said you should get permission first. Certainly <br/>
&gt; that's a nice thing to do but I don't see it as necessary. After <br/>
all, <br/>
&gt; people put HHs into boxes all the time without permission. I think <br/>
&gt; that cuckoo clues are generally left without permission. I don't <br/>
see <br/>
&gt; why a bonus box clue should fall into a special category of <br/>
requiring <br/>
