another historic (read "dead") tree, but hope to get to letterbox <br/>
some living big trees soon. These clues are also at our website at<br/>

<br/>
Another dead tree, but oh, what a memory!<br/>
<br/>
An easy, mostly level 1 miles for three letterboxes. Less than an <br/>
hour of walking. The trails are rather new and sometimes a bit rough, <br/>
and the blazes don't follow the usual conventions, but it's easy to <br/>
find your way around this short loop.<br/>
<br/>
On Rte. 12 in Gales Ferry CT, take Long Cove Rd eastward. Follow it <br/>
1 miles to the end at Vinegar Hill Rd. Straight across you'll see <br/>
the entrance to the Nathan Lester House and the Ledyard Oak trails.<br/>
