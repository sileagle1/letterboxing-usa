in Allentown PA<br/>
<br/>
General Harry C. Trexler was a longtime benefactor of the Lehigh <br/>
Valley area and 2004 marks the sesquicentennial of his birth.<br/>
<br/>
Trexler Park is one of the City of Allentown's many beautiful parks, <br/>
located on the former estate of General Trexler.  The park's main <br/>
parking lot can be reached by traveling on Cedar Crest Boulevard in <br/>
W. Allentown, turning west onto Broadway and North onto Springhouse <br/>
Rd.  The park entrance is on the right.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning at the main parking lot, follow the path bearing 30deg <br/>
until you need to decide whether to follow bicycles or pedestrians.  <br/>
Follow the bikes, which will depart at a bearing at 150deg.  After <br/>
the 5th stone cycle, the path will diverge.  Leave your cycling <br/>
brethren behind and go where only pedestrians may, following a <br/>
bearing of 340deg.  This path less traveled will head up a hill and <br/>
turn west as you approach the General.<br/>
<br/>
Visit the General, enjoying the vista.  Mosey around his pavilion, <br/>
finding the downspout that will give you the General at 15deg.  From <br/>
there 11 paces at 240deg until you reach a tree shaped like a vee.  <br/>
Look Due west a few paces and you will find a log with a tail that <br/>
conceals the Mini-General.<br/>
<br/>
To Exit the park continue on the path you came on until it rejoins <br/>
the main path and returns to the parking area.  Total walking <br/>
distance about 1.5 miles.<br/>
<br/>
We'd love to hear from you.<br/>
