                       The GREAT TREE HIKE <br/>
Orange is the fashion color in season. <br/>
This hike is in the Tyler Mill Open Space Area,  on the other side of the
Muddy River from the <i>Morris Rock Vista Hike </i>. On this hike there are
many lovely GREAT TREES, It is a hike for all seasons. Spring finds the land
painted creamy white with Dutchman's Britches and other wildflowers. Summer
finds the hawks soaring with children's kites. Bikers and horses also use
the trails. Winter snows bring out the snowshoes and cross country skis. <br/>
Begin the hike by walking west on the paved road and notice the first GREAT
TREES are the sugar maples on your right. Off on the left is the Muddy River
that bisects the Tyler Mill Open Space. <br/>
Soon a trap rock ridge becomes evident on your right.. Watch for a heap of
pavement on the right opposite a small cleared parking space. This is the
start of the blue trail and a blue blaze is faintly showing on a hunk of
pavement in the pile. Turn right into the woods and begin a gentle climb
into a hemlock grove. Cross over an unmarked path and continue on the blue
trail, dipping down and coming to a 'Y' intersection with a red trail. There
is a  GREAT three sister OAK TREE at the intersection on your right. Turn
left continuing on the blue trail that has now joined up with the red. Proceed
up hill twisting and turning through a Cedar grove coming out of the grove
as the Red trail meets another trail going right into a field. At this intersection,
turn back into the woods going left uphill on the red blazed trail. Soon
two more GREAT TREES come into view. Notice the GREAT BEECH TREE on your
left and the GREAT sugar MAPLE TREE on your right. The best is yet to come
!! Climb a short steep hill traveled by many bikers, and at the top pass
by an unmarked trail on your right .  Now notice several GREAT TREES on your
left, but the GREAT WOLF BEECH TREE on the left is the one to find. Take
time to look at this 'living' Totem Pole and think of all it has seen. According
to the Park Nature Book, the many 'babies' around this Wolf tree have not
grown from seeds, but are true clones coming up from the GREAT Tree's  roots.
Stand with your back to the Wolf Tree and take a reading of 320 degrees.
Follow that about 10 feet off trail to a Cedar tree. the GREAT WOLF TREE
letterbox treasure is there. Stamp in and carefully seal and hide again. <br/>
Return back to the Red trail and retrace back about 50 feet to the unmarked
trail now on your left. It is well traveled and goes up in a NE direction
, soon going steeply down. At the bottom of the hill watch carefully and
turn right [east] onto an unmarked trail --just <u>before</u> a white blazed
trail.  On this unmarked trail notice a field is on your left. Soon the trail
crossed over a stone wall and now take notice of the trap rock hill on your
right. The trail curves right and then crosses the stone wall again. go right
about six big steps along the wall and find the Trap Rock Hill Letterbox
in a rock hole along the side of the wall covered by a rock with a "handle"
Stamp in and place the box carefully back. Continue up hill through the woods
and meet up with the Red trail again. Turn left, east, and soon notice your
old friends the GREAT TREES , now on opposite sides of the trail !! When
the Red trail meets the junction at the field, turn left now out into the
open field. Enjoy the views of the soccer fields below and a great place
to fly kites. Look for the Go Fly A Kite Letter box by walking left into
the field and left along the woods about 22 paces to large quartz rock. The
Treasure is south of the bolder at the feet of a GREAT PINE TREE . Stamp
in and carefully return the box to it's hiding place. Return to the Red/Blue
Trail and proceed down through the Cedar grove to the intersection where
the GREAT three Sister OAK TREE stands and turn right, south onto the blue
trail and back to the park road then left to your car. I hope you have enjoyed
the GREAT TREES of Tyler Mill. <br/>
