We have hidden a new box for all of you to enjoy at the Vt. Morgan <br/>
Horse Farm. We searched for Mount Snow ( Vt.) unsuccessfully - but <br/>
you should have seen the motocross racing and bike racing on the <br/>
mountain. Drewclan I think the spot became a motocross drive through <br/>
email me off list to verify area. Well cowboy was very impressed.  <br/>
Also recently Graduated the Dancing Men Box after 3 tries many miles <br/>
and lots of brain bending and the Cowboy  found it!! Thanks Pete! My <br/>
family is relieved it won't be the dinner topic of conversation. ( <br/>
HAHAHA  ) Thanks Wanda ,after speaking at the fair you knew we would <br/>
be out there and I can't believe you stopped on your way to Vermont <br/>
to see us, waiting for us to come out of the trail with rootbeer on <br/>
ice, and grapes was a treat only shared by the Drew's. Then on to <br/>
Vermont we all went. <br/>
 We  also did a day at the beach recently and added Ninigret Pond and <br/>
Perfect Summer Day to our Count. I reccomend Ninigret to families the <br/>
Cowboy was in bike heaven!  Now to catch the birds in Storrs minus <br/>
the thunder of the other night. <br/>
    The Depot boxes recently added were great we loved that  <br/>
threesome. Oh the count is going up. Have Fun - Be Safe - Leader of <br/>
the Pack<br/>

Happy to see that you enjoyed Ninigret.  I have to admit that it is <br/>
our usual Fri night activity in the summer (thus the LB writeup) so <br/>
if the thunderstorms hold off tomorrow...  If you are there during <br/>
the day you should also add a trip to the Fantastic Umbrella Factory <br/>
which is almost next door.<br/>
