  This will serve as my introduction to the list. I'm posting it under this subject line because it was thru the article in the Hartford Courant that I became aware of this very interesting sport. My name is Tina Habegger, I live in central CT. I have been an avid hiker for as long as I can remember, and I enjoy solving puzzles, so as you may well imagine I read the newspaper article with great interest. I checked out the URL listed in the article, did some exploring, and am already experimenting with creating my own stamp. I hope to get out by next weekend to locate and stamp my first letterbox.  Can placing a box be far behind?<br/>
I'm really excited about this 'new' (new to me) outdoor activity.  <br/>
           Take Care,  Tina<br/>

    I caught the article on line, but was without the photos.  Please send<br/>
me a hard copy snail mail if you have one.  By the way, have you sent for a<br/>
copy of the Vermont Valley Quest boxes yet?  You really should, and perhaps<br/>
do some Letterboxing on your upcoming vacation.  If not Valley Quest, I'm<br/>
saving the Long Trail boxes and the one at McGrath's Irish Pub to do with<br/>
someone...so if you come this way, they are here in Rutland/Killington.  How<br/>
is EMS?  Has your new manager started yet?  I went for an awesome paddle<br/>
today on The Chittenden Reservoir.  I was the only one out there.  It is up<br/>
higher than the other Lakes and totally surrounded by mountains.  It was so<br/>
peaceful that I could hear my watch ticking, between the Loon calls.  Went<br/>
to the Vermont State Fair last night to take in some of the local color.<br/>
Very friendly and very laid back folks up here.  So far I'm enjoying it, but<br/>
need to meet some playmates.  Say Hi to everyone for me and let me know if I<br/>
may see you in October, or any other time for that matter.<br/>

&gt;I think that the article that Claudia Van Nes wrote was excellent! It's<br/>
great publicity for Letterboxing! I'll have to forward a copy to you Sarah<br/>
so maybe you'll start another letterboxing board in the "great outdoors."<br/>
Um, yes, lots of poison ivy at that box by the way. Lucky me, i'm immune to<br/>
it... ah but the mosquitoes were quite rampant that misty morning. See you<br/>
