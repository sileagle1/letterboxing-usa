I just buy new ones.  *shrug*  It's not like they're especially <br/>
expensive, and I generally get quite a bit of mileage out of them <br/>
before they start tearing rather than cutting.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I use a #400 grit diamond pad for stained glass, but you could use a<br/>
small sharpening stone and some oil, both can be found in a hardware<br/>
store.  Hold it so the cutting edge of the gouge is at the same angle<br/>
it is now (this is important), use a magnifyer &amp; good lighting.  After<br/>
you do both sides there will be a burr on the inside that needs to be<br/>
removed with a small piece of fine sandpaper folded in half, grit side<br/>
out. Draw the sandpaper thru and out the "V" in one direction. I have<br/>
found that just about all the Speedball gouge nibs are dull and/or<br/>
crinkled and sharpen them all before I use them the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

Check out Drewclan's website.  I'm pretty sure he has a link to <br/>
someone who shows how to do it with a sharpening stone.  My husband <br/>
has done mine with fair success.  The detail desired when using the <br/>
small blades is tragically lost when using a dull one. -sunshine    <br/>
