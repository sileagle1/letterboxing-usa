Had a fantastic day with my letterboxing pals, Floating Feather and <br/>
Lockmaster!!<br/>
We went to Liberty State Park, which included a ferry ride to Ellis Island <br/>
and to the Statue of Liberty.<br/>
You could not have asked for a better day!!<br/>
While we were there we hunted the letterbox planted within the park, but <br/>
dispite our most valiant efforts we came up un-stamped...<br/>
Anyone out there stamp into that box recently?<br/>
Most places in the park are well groomed and maintained, with many recent <br/>
"plantings". Some locations were blocked off to the public and patroled by <br/>
Park police on both islands.<br/>
Anyway, it was a day for the memory books!! If you ever go, check out the <br/>
Imax Dome Theater at the Liberty Science Center!!! WOW!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy 'boxing!  See Joy<br/>
