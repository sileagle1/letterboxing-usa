What a bummer!  I found Greyfriars Bobby sometime in July, and I know others <br/>
have mentioned finding it since.  It was a wonderful box in a great little <br/>
park!<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if perhaps all of the recent rains had something to do with its <br/>
disappearance?  But, before you give up, you might want to go back and take a good <br/>
look in the general vicinity.  I say this because I recently had a similar <br/>
experience.  I checked in on my Faces of Nature box over Labor Day weekend, and it <br/>
was fine.  A few days later, a co-worker went in search of it to no avail.  I <br/>
knew she was looking in the right place because she described it very well.  <br/>
I went to check, and, sure enough, it was gone!  I was soooooo upset, since it <br/>
was my first local box.  Knowing there was another LBer's box placed in the <br/>
same park, I checked on theirs.  It was fine.  Was almost out to my car, ready <br/>
to drive home, and thought I'd look again.  No, it wasn't in the proper hiding <br/>
spot.  But, scanning the vicinity while walking the trail, I found it approx. <br/>
50 feet away.  Telltale critter marks on it!  They had eaten large holes in <br/>
the outer bag, but had not gotten into the box.  But they certainly managed to <br/>
drag it out from under a huge downed tree and carry it a great distance!  All <br/>
the contents were intact.  The container was brand new and had never been used <br/>
for food, so I'm not sure what attracted them to it. <br/>
<br/>
I hope if you get a chance to go back again, that you will be able to locate <br/>
it.  It was my first find in your remarkable dogs series.  I just located two <br/>
of the others in the series this past weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Something similar happened to my Ace of Clubs micro-box. Two boxers<br/>
told me they were sure they had the right spot, but the box wasn't<br/>
there. They did find it, but it had been dragged off and chewed up by<br/>
some critter.  This was a new box. After the first report I replaced<br/>
it and even went so far to wash the box and then spray it with the<br/>
stuff used by hunters to remove all human scent.  I'm not sure what<br/>
the lure was, one of the finders thought that because the stamp is in<br/>
the bottom it made the box look like an (exotic) nut to a squirrel. <br/>
Or maybe it was hidden in someone's home.    <br/>
<br/>
So maybe the box really isn't MIA, it's just in a new mystery spot?<br/>
