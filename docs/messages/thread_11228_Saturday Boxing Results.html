<div>Braved the pounding rain and went out to find the 
Cal State Long Beach boxes.  We found two : '49er Mascot' and 'Catching 
Some Sun in the Quad'.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We tried to find the Real 49er but had no 
luck.  Ironically, when we were looking for the Real 49er, we ended up 
within feet of 'Catching Some Sun in Quad'.  We had the wrong number in 
mind when we were looking for Custer's number and that brought us almost right 
to the Sun box.  A phone call to my Mom gave us the number that was more 
likely to be Custer's.  For anyone looking for this box, do your research 
BEFORE you are standing in the pouring rain, ankle deep in a puddle holding a 
soggy piece of paper.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As for the Real 49er, we think we were in the right 
place.  The three adjoined metal cones on a road was a good clue.  
That was what made us think we were in the right spot.  There was an 
open gate right next to the spot we thought was the location so someone may 
have been there recently.  We didn't find the box and were getting drenched 
and hungry so we called off the search.</div>

<div>PS: I still have the 'Ewe Be Gone' 
Hitchhiker.  I have a spot in mind for it but our original plans for the 
weekend were rained out.  I plan on taking it to a new home on the 
29th.</div></body></html>
