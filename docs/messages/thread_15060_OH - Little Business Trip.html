                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am in Cleveland area on a business trip, so thought I'd do a little<br/>
hunting while I'm here.  Here is a quick run down of what I found (or<br/>
didn't find):<br/>
<br/>
Just Above Par - All in good condition<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox on the Ridge - Possible MIA.  Found the trees in question<br/>
and saw good places to hide a letterbox, but no box was found.<br/>
<br/>
Parker's Ranch - Part of the blue Canada Goose trail is closed for<br/>
construction.  A quick trip to the Nature Center for a look at that<br/>
trail map showed a short detour.  Off I went and found the box in good<br/>
condition.<br/>
<br/>
Huntington Box - Box was a little damp, but the containt were<br/>
perfectly dry.<br/>
<br/>
Bradley Woods - This was kinda half a box.  Found the log and lid to<br/>
the container in the hiding spot, but no stamp.  The log was<br/>
absolutely soaked.  Put a note in the log, replaced the ziploc bag<br/>
with a new one and put it back.<br/>
<br/>
Euclid Creek - Another great hike in another Metro Park.  Found the<br/>
box in perfect shape.<br/>
<br/>
Squire's Castle - A really cool castle.  The box was not in the hiding<br/>
place mentioned in the clue on the web site.  Another poster mentioned<br/>
last month, that the box may have been moved due to trail maintenance,<br/>
so not sure if the clue on the web site was the old or new hiding<br/>
place.  In any event, came away from this one empty handed.<br/>
<br/>
Peeper Hollow - Found the box, again, a little damp (but then I<br/>
understand the area has had more then enough rain recently). <br/>
Containts were nice and dry. Found a little surprise to boot, the<br/>
School Days HH.  Not sure if I will have time to replant it before I<br/>
leave, so it may end up in a box in Western Wisconsin.<br/>
<br/>
Over all, the trip was great. (and yes, I got some work done too.)  I<br/>
must say, Cleveland sure has some wonderful Metro parks and loads of<br/>
hiking trails.  Next time, I'll remember to bring my bug spray.<br/>
<br/>
Going to count the bug bites now.<br/>
