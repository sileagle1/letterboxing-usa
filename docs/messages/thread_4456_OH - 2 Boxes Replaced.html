worldly goods being roughly moved around?  The Valley of the Frogs <br/>
has been a little like this for the last couple days. <br/>
<br/>
First:  Franzsolo's Blue Hole has been moved and has an entirely <br/>
different clue set.  Enough different that it is ours... Fact is, <br/>
franzsolo will need to find it himself!  (No war going on here, this <br/>
was an amicable arrangement.)<br/>
<br/>
New clues for the Blue Hole  (Jay, it will now be hosted on my server)<br/>
<br/>
http://www.qsl.net/ws8g/bluehole.htm<br/>
<br/>
There are also new clues and new, friendly spots for the Cliffs of <br/>
Insanity series.  See the new clues at:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Note:  if you plan on doing the John Bryan series, make a copy of the <br/>
instructions for reading Shavian.  Several boxes now require this <br/>
little skill.  <br/>
