<p><b><span>This 
is our first box posting and I hope we've done it right.  We probably will 
add more boxes so you could call the page Maggie's Family's Boxes or something 
like that.  Here we go.  Thanks.</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Back Beyond the 
Bay</span></b><br/><br/>Placed By:<span>  </span>Maggies Family</p>
<p>E-mail: <a href="mailto:Maggies.family@verizon.net">maggies.family@verizon.net</a> <br/>Date Placed: 09/16/02</p>
<p>Time:<span>  </span>3-4 hours by bike, 
round trip, with stops<br/>Location: Virginia Beach, VA<br/>Difficulty: Serious 
walk; fun, easy bike ride.</p>
<p> <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = 
"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You wont have to work on Maggies Farm no more</p>
<p>If you follow Maggies Family . . . . .<span>  </span>to the shore.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Our first box weve stashed in a beautiful place,</p>
<p>Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a trace.</p>
<p>Its not easy to get to, in fact quite a hike,</p>
<p>So may we suggest that you dust off your bike.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Load up the car and head Back to the Bay,</p>
<p>Youll pass through the bridge of Sand on your way.</p>
<p>Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge gate,</p>
<p>When you get to the Station, theres no need to wait.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll see lots of birds, and horses, and maybe a wild boar,</p>
<p>So pay the five dollars and be glad its not more.</p>
<p>Unload all the bikes and start down the path.</p>
<p>Youve got four miles to go, because we did the math.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Take your water, your camera, your lunch, and embark,</p>
<p>Go down the main path and head for the park.</p>
<p>Youll come to a fork, both trails well-traveled.</p>
<p>But go left on East Dike; we hope youre not baffled.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And whatever you do, dont take the Dune Trail,</p>
<p>Youll end up on the beach and you will have failed.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll pass by a sign with a date and a duck.</p>
<p>You may think its there, but oh, no such luck!</p>
<p>We hid it there first, but we did all agree,</p>
<p>It was too easy to find, and theres much more to see!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Peddle on to the park and dont miss the boat,</p>
<p>Veer to the left and be sure to take note.</p>
<p>Youll come to a platform, 22 it is marked,</p>
<p>Stop for a rest, youll be glad that you parked.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Soon youll be at the Station, in a moment or so,</p>
<p>Its quite clean and tidy in case youve Got to GO!</p>
<p>Youll see a small shop and tables (if youve brought something to 
eat)</p>
<p>Insides a nice man who we think you should meet.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Look all around at this blissful location,</p>
<p>Its a nice place to camp should you be on vacation.</p>
<p>But since youre on a real quest, turn left at the sign,</p>
<p>That reads, Ocean/Beach Camp. Youre close to the find!!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Past the ramp on the left (but what is it for?)</p>
<p>NO! Dont turn right to Washwoods - keep on to the shore.</p>
<p>The trails a bit sandy. Its a little hard going,</p>
<p>We saw horses there -- their manes all aglowing.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When you get to the walkway (its wooden) just park,</p>
<p>Time to walk a ways now so get on your mark.</p>
<p>Step on to the planks and count out your paces,</p>
<p>Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little shoelaces.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Pass Delicate Dunes and glance right for our riddle,</p>
<p>Youll see some bushes with a dead branch in the middle.</p>
<p>Reach down in the sea grass, but look fore you grab,</p>
<p>Youll discover our prize, and we hope not a crab!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Now once youve stamped in you can do what you likes,</p>
<p>But may we suggest that you get back on your bikes.</p>
<p>Head over the dunes, and we hope its low tide.</p>
<p>Because if it is you are in for a ride!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And even if the tide is a little bit high,</p>
<p>Just follow the beach with the ocean right by.</p>
<p>Its a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a myth,</p>
<p>Must have looked much the same to Capt. John Smith.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Head back whence you came and try not to roam,</p>
<p>NOW take the Dune Trail and find your way home.</p>
<p>So ends your adventure. The day is now done.</p>
<p>Good luck on your next quest. We hope youve had 
fun.</p></div>

website! Thanks for the good clues. As soon as we are allowed to go into False 
Cape again and the weather is cooler, I'll go looking for it as I live in Va

<div> <span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> Very few Letterboxers are 
boaters. There are a few boxes on some rivers ( Rogue River , Ore.) but 
they can be accessed by other ways. I believe the Paisley  Orca has a 
couple of flat water boxes in Ca. as well as Ore. We have set up most of 
our white water boxes along the Kern river so that they can be reached 
along a river trail or just below a rapid. Don </div>

<div></div>&gt;publish a second one this spring and will place it in the web page as 
<div></div>&gt;well 
<div></div>&gt;as that seems to work best. 
<div></div>&gt; 
<div></div>&gt;Lastly, do you have a background called "scroll.gif" that I can have to

<div></div>&gt;a the background for the clues on the page?

  <div></div>&gt;Great website! Thanks for the good clues. As soon as we are 
  allowed to 
  <div></div>&gt;go into False Cape again and the weather is cooler, I'll go 
  looking for 
  <div></div>&gt;it as I live in Va Beach. Does your family kayak? I've placed a 
  box in 
  <div></div>&gt;NC just over the state line near Sligo and Moyock, but it's 
  only 
  <div></div>&gt;accessible by kayak or canoe. So far no one has told me they've 
  found it 
  <div></div>&gt;and I wonder if the clues are too hard or if people who 
  letterbox are 
  <div></div>&gt;not boaters? Lillie

  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Hello Trish, 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;My family is new to Letterboxing and planted our first box in 
  Virginia 
  <div></div>&gt;Beach 
  <div></div>&gt;last September. It then took us until early December to get the 
  Poem 
  <div></div>&gt;written and up on the site. But I am afraid it has gotten lost. 
  It 
  <div></div>&gt;actually showed up on the What's New page for awhile but has 
  now 
  <div></div>&gt;disappeared 
  <div></div>&gt;(or at least I cannot find it). Then, when I saw your e-mail 
  that the 
  <div></div>&gt;VA 
  <div></div>&gt;webpage had been updated, I didn't see it. So I am afraid the 
  clue 
  <div></div>&gt;itself 
  <div></div>&gt;has disappeared - hope the box is still there. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;I am attaching the original e-mail with the clues. Since then, 
  I have 
  <div></div>&gt;placed it in a webpage at http://mysite.verizon.net/vze2jt4p/ - 
  can you 
  <div></div>&gt;put 
  <div></div>&gt;it into the webpage the next time you update and, since it does 
  not 
  <div></div>&gt;appear 
  <div></div>&gt;in What's New, should I republish it in the Group as if it was 
  new? We 
  <div></div>&gt;will 
  <div></div>&gt;publish a second one this spring and will place it in the web 
  page as 
  <div></div>&gt;well 
  <div></div>&gt;as that seems to work best. 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Lastly, do you have a background called "scroll.gif" that I can 
  have to 
  <div></div>&gt;use 
  <div></div>&gt;a the background for the clues on the page? 
  <div></div>&gt; 
  <div></div>&gt;Many questions - thanks for your help.

<p>Time:<span>  </span>3-4 hours by bike, round trip, with stops<br/>Location: Virginia Beach, VA<br/>Difficulty: Serious walk; fun, easy bike ride.</p>
<p> <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>You wont have to work on Maggies Farm no more</p>
<p>If you follow Maggies Family . . . . .<span>  </span>to the shore.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Our first box weve stashed in a beautiful place,</p>
<p>Where people are scarce, yes, hardly a trace.</p>
<p>Its not easy to get to, in fact quite a hike,</p>
<p>So may we suggest that you dust off your bike.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Load up the car and head Back to the Bay,</p>
<p>Youll pass through the bridge of Sand on your way.</p>
<p>Follow Sandpiper south to the Refuge gate,</p>
<p>When you get to the Station, theres no need to wait.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll see lots of birds, and horses, and maybe a wild boar,</p>
<p>So pay the five dollars and be glad its not more.</p>
<p>Unload all the bikes and start down the path.</p>
<p>Youve got four miles to go, because we did the math.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Take your water, your camera, your lunch, and embark,</p>
<p>Go down the main path and head for the park.</p>
<p>Youll come to a fork, both trails well-traveled.</p>
<p>But go left on East Dike; we hope youre not baffled.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And whatever you do, dont take the Dune Trail,</p>
<p>Youll end up on the beach and you will have failed.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Youll pass by a sign with a date and a duck.</p>
<p>You may think its there, but oh, no such luck!</p>
<p>We hid it there first, but we did all agree,</p>
<p>It was too easy to find, and theres much more to see!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Peddle on to the park and dont miss the boat,</p>
<p>Veer to the left and be sure to take note.</p>
<p>Youll come to a platform, 22 it is marked,</p>
<p>Stop for a rest, youll be glad that you parked.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Soon youll be at the Station, in a moment or so,</p>
<p>Its quite clean and tidy in case youve Got to GO!</p>
<p>Youll see a small shop and tables (if youve brought something to eat)</p>
<p>Insides a nice man who we think you should meet.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Look all around at this blissful location,</p>
<p>Its a nice place to camp should you be on vacation.</p>
<p>But since youre on a real quest, turn left at the sign,</p>
<p>That reads, Ocean/Beach Camp. Youre close to the find!!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Past the ramp on the left (but what is it for?)</p>
<p>NO! Dont turn right to Washwoods - keep on to the shore.</p>
<p>The trails a bit sandy. Its a little hard going,</p>
<p>We saw horses there -- their manes all aglowing.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>When you get to the walkway (its wooden) just park,</p>
<p>Time to walk a ways now so get on your mark.</p>
<p>Step on to the planks and count out your paces,</p>
<p>Fifty, sixty, or more if you wear little shoelaces.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Pass Delicate Dunes and glance right for our riddle,</p>
<p>Youll see some bushes with a dead branch in the middle.</p>
<p>Reach down in the sea grass, but look fore you grab,</p>
<p>Youll discover our prize, and we hope not a crab!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Now once youve stamped in you can do what you likes,</p>
<p>But may we suggest that you get back on your bikes.</p>
<p>Head over the dunes, and we hope its low tide.</p>
<p>Because if it is you are in for a ride!</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>And even if the tide is a little bit high,</p>
<p>Just follow the beach with the ocean right by.</p>
<p>Its a beautiful site, unspoiled, like a myth,</p>
<p>Must have looked much the same to Capt. John Smith.</p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>Head back whence you came and try not to roam,</p>
<p>NOW take the Dune Trail and find your way home.</p>
<p>So ends your adventure. The day is now done.</p>
<p>Good luck on your next quest. We hope youve had fun.</p></div><br/><br/><tt>To unsubscribe: mailto:letterbox-usa-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>List etiquette, info, etc: <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html">http://www.letterboxing.org/list.html</a><br/></tt><br/><br/><tt>Your use of Yahoo!
