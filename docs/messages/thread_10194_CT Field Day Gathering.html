                    <html><body>Hartman was beautiful this morning: the chocolate lab and I arrived with the sun and birdsong rang in my mind through the rest of the long indoor day. Hartman Park has saved my sanity more than once over the years I've come to know it.
<br/>
<br/>In the past, we've enjoyed giving back to the park with spring trail maintanence chores with my mountain bike racing team, and this year I talked with the park manager about sponsoring a letterbox gathering with a twist.

<br/>So in early April, we plan a day of food and exchanging, between brush clearing, blaze painting, and windfall chain sawing.
<br/>
<br/>Hartman is starting to show some wear, tear, and wrinkles with the popularity it gained by being profiled in "Fifty Hikes in Connecticut," not to mention all the knobby-tired scuff marks. Since the manager and the chief trail planner have been so supportive of letterboxing, we hope for a great turnout from this wonderful community. We can enjoy the company of great friends while sprucing up this little gem of woodlands.

<br/>Count us in (CSCM and Rustypuff). As I've said before, there is nothing more music to the ears to a park or reservation staff member than the words, "We've got a volunteer work crew for you....what do you want us to do?"
<br/>
<br/>Let us know the date and we'll try hard as heck to be there :)
