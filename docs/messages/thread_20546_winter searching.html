Hi Andy,<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing in the snow *is* a special forces operation!<br/>
<br/>
1.  You have to find the landmarks that are in the clues.  Those <br/>
landmarks could be covered by 2 cm to 2 meters of snow.<br/>
<br/>
2.  You have to access the letterbox location.  Bringing a prybar <br/>
and/or icepick is sometimes necessary in extreme ice conditions.  And <br/>
here in New England, we have *EXTREME* winter conditions.  There are <br/>
also times when an entire AREA is inaccessible due to several meters <br/>
of snow, a frozen (and unstable) streambed, a frozen waterfall <br/>
cascading over a rock face that you are supposed to *climb*<br/>
<br/>
3.  We have, unfortunately, a real problem with vandalism.  Vandals <br/>
come in all sizes and shapes, in all ages and races and sexes.  <br/>
Vandalism is an equal opportunity employer.  We winter boxers must, <br/>
therefore, make sure we do not leave an obvious set of footprints in <br/>
the snow to a letterbox's location.  We have all developed an <br/>
elaborate system of "covering our tracks", from carrying yellow-dyed <br/>
water in a bottle to squirt on the snow (as if using a nearby tree as <br/>
a loo), walking past the assumed letterbox location, then <br/>
backtracking along another trail and/or judiciously bushwhacking to <br/>
the letterbox from another direction entirely, or by deliberately <br/>
making a bazillion tracks all over the place as if an entire herd of <br/>
children ran through the area.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, now that I think about it, we should have a "Letterboxing <br/>
Special Forces" badge made up for all those hardy letterboxers who <br/>
brave the harshest New England winters, the destructive South East <br/>
hurricanes, the deadly West Coast earthquakes, the massive flooding <br/>
in the Deep South, the winds of The Dust Bowl, the deserts and the <br/>
mountains in the west/midwest, and just plain old staying alive in <br/>
the suicide capital of America, the Pacific Northwest.<br/>

That sounds a lot like my approach--and those kinds of things usually happen<br/>

I did want to say that I have been previewing some UT clues in prep for a<br/>

winter, so there is still an ember!!<br/>

&gt;landmarks could be covered by 2 cm to 2 meters of snow.<br/><br/>
&gt;<br/><br/>
&gt;2. You have to access the letterbox location. Bringing a prybar <br/><br/>
&gt;and/or icepick is sometimes necessary in extreme ice conditions. And <br/><br/>
&gt;here in New England, we have *EXTREME* winter conditions. There are <br/><br/>
&gt;also times when an entire AREA is inaccessible due to several meters <br/><br/>
&gt;of snow, a frozen (and unstable) streambed, a frozen waterfall <br/><br/>
&gt;cascading over a rock face that you are supposed to *climb*<br/><br/>
&gt;<br/><br/>
&gt;3. We have, unfortunately, a real problem with vandalism. Vandals <br/><br/>
&gt;come in all sizes and shapes, in all ages and races and sexes. <br/><br/>
&gt;Vandalism is an equal opportunity employer. We winter boxers must, <br/><br/>
&gt;therefore, make sure we do not leave an obvious set of footprints in <br/><br/>
&gt;the snow to a letterbox's location. We have all developed an <br/><br/>
&gt;elaborate system of "covering our tracks", from carrying yellow-dyed <br/><br/>
&gt;water in a bottle to squirt on the snow (as if using a nearby tree as <br/><br/>
&gt;a loo), walking past the assumed letterbox location, then <br/><br/>
&gt;backtracking along another trail and/or judiciously bushwhacking to <br/><br/>
&gt;the letterbox from another direction entirely, or by deliberately <br/><br/>
&gt;making a bazillion tracks all over the place as if an entire herd of <br/><br/>
&gt;children ran through the area.<br/><br/>
&gt;<br/><br/>
&gt;Actually, now that I think about it, we should have a "Letterboxing <br/><br/>
&gt;Special Forces" badge made up for all those hardy letterboxers who <br/><br/>
&gt;brave the harshest New England winters, the destructive South East <br/><br/>
&gt;hurricanes, the deadly West Coast earthquakes, the massive flooding <br/><br/>
&gt;in the Deep South, the winds of The Dust Bowl, the deserts and the <br/><br/>
&gt;mountains in the west/midwest, and just plain old staying alive in <br/><br/>
&gt;the suicide capital of America, the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>

<br/>
I don't think there are any 'rules' regarding letterboxing in the <br/>
snow but some good judgement should apply.  We've found several <br/>
dozen boxes in snow/ice conditions over the past couple of years and <br/>
have learned a few things along the way.  The obvious thing is to <br/>
really avoid leaving tracks in the snow that lead directly to the <br/>
letterbox--lay false tracks, camouflage your route with leaf/pine <br/>
needle debris, whatever you can do to make it less obvious that <br/>
there was a reason you headed in a certain direction, take great <br/>
care of the terrain &amp; wildlife as you go along (trails are less <br/>
obvious, could cause unnecessary erosion in a spot that without snow <br/>
wouldn't have any problems, etc).  <br/>
<br/>
We sought out a series of letterboxes in the Cascade Mountains the <br/>
beginning of May last year.  After finding the first two boxes in <br/>
the series, slipping, sliding &amp; suffering from snow &amp; ice capped <br/>
trails (without donning snow shoes &amp; two little ones in tow)--we <br/>
ultimately had to stop the hunt mid hike for safety reasons (very <br/>
hard to do since it took about 100 miles of driving to get to the <br/>
trail head and then a 4 mile hike to get to the point where we <br/>
turned around!).  So, 2 boxes in that series remain 'undiscovered' <br/>
by us still.  <br/>
<br/>
Another thing we experienced while letterboxing in snow blanketed <br/>
Boise, Idaho last January.  Many of the letterboxes were hidden in <br/>
nooks and crannies behind small rocks.  Some boxes we could see, <br/>
even touch, but could not 'get' without damaging the box because the <br/>
rocks or the box itself were frozen TO THE GROUND.  Nothing we could <br/>
do would budge them.  So that, too, was very frustrating.  Nope, <br/>
even deicer wouldn't 'unstick' the little rock that was frozen to <br/>
the little footbridge beneath its side rail right in front of the <br/>
letterbox we were looking for--talk about frustrating!<br/>
<br/>
Then, we cap off our snow experience with 4 solid days of boxing in <br/>
DC/VA last January.  Again, the blanket of snow &amp; ice made it <br/>
difficult to discern the more detailed aspect of the clues.  Damage <br/>
to the area from a recent tropical storm passing through the area <br/>
only made matters worse.  Again, rocks frozen to the ground made <br/>
matters worse and 'snow trails' leading to the boxes was another <br/>
thing that came up often.  Micro-boxes (such as film canisters) <br/>
hidden on the ground or within tree stumps were especially <br/>
vulnerable to being frozen in place, frozen solid, unretrievable <br/>
until the thaw occurred, or just were permanently reshaped because <br/>
the water that snuck in them over the summer froze solid and warped <br/>
the containers..  <br/>
<br/>
Something else to consider is that many inkpads don't work as well <br/>
in sub-freezing temps.  We use a 3 color stamp pad and one color <br/>
just failed altogether (fuchsia) &amp; is still ruined even after it <br/>
thawed out.  The others were better although the purple proved far <br/>
more durable in the long run than the cyan blue.<br/>
<br/>
So, letterboxing in snow is still possible but it really brings with <br/>
it some interesting situations,<br/>

Hi Andy,<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I should also emphasize an unspoken but often practiced rule <br/>
of thumb among letterboxers here in the States - "leave no trace".<br/>
<br/>
That means, among other things, respect the location in which the <br/>
letterbox is placed.  Do not leave trash there, rehide the box as <br/>
carefully as you can, be aware of what you are trampling on (flora or <br/>
fauna).<br/>
<br/>
The US has so very few unspoiled, wild, truly natural areas left.  <br/>
Urbanization is rampant.  When we do "get out on the trail", for many <br/>
of us, it is an unbelievable treat, to see sights that take your <br/>
breath away.  Compare us to a bunch of blokes who room four in a flat <br/>
in London.  Forever.  Who have never seen the moors.  Then one day we <br/>
are transported out to Dartmoor.  Just being in so much open space <br/>
would be overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
We are bombarded by media and science studies that tell us just how <br/>
much we are doing to damage our environment.  Probably a good lot of <br/>
US boxers are overly conscious of bespoiling a pristine location.  <br/>
And that's where many of the really nice boxes are located.  We often <br/>
deliberately plant boxes in places to *make* another person discover <br/>
that out of the way rare place that makes you go "oooohhhhh".  <br/>
We "share" our little "treasures" with each other that way - come and <br/>
find my box, and I will show you something truly beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps to put a more rounded perspective on what we do and <br/>
sometimes why we do it.  We just don't take our environment for <br/>
granted, that's all.  Because we know that in a generation or two, <br/>
someone will pave the rest of paradise and put up a parking lot*.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;Hi Andy,<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;Letterboxing in the snow *is* a special forces operation!<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;1.  You have to find the landmarks that are in the clues.  Those <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;landmarks could be covered by 2 cm to 2 meters of snow.<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;2.  You have to access the letterbox location.  Bringing a prybar <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;and/or icepick is sometimes necessary in extreme ice conditions. <br/>
And <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;here in New England, we have *EXTREME* winter conditions.  There<br/>
are <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;also times when an entire AREA is inaccessible due to several<br/>
meters <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;of snow, a frozen (and unstable) streambed, a frozen waterfall <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;cascading over a rock face that you are supposed to *climb*<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;3.  We have, unfortunately, a real problem with vandalism.  Vandals<br/>
<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;come in all sizes and shapes, in all ages and races and sexes.  <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;Vandalism is an equal opportunity employer.  We winter boxers must,<br/>
<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;therefore, make sure we do not leave an obvious set of footprints<br/>
in <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;the snow to a letterbox's location.  We have all developed an <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;elaborate system of "covering our tracks", from carrying<br/>
yellow-dyed <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;water in a bottle to squirt on the snow (as if using a nearby tree<br/>
as <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;a loo), walking past the assumed letterbox location, then <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;backtracking along another trail and/or judiciously bushwhacking to<br/>
<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;the letterbox from another direction entirely, or by deliberately <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;making a bazillion tracks all over the place as if an entire herd<br/>
of <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;children ran through the area.<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;Actually, now that I think about it, we should have a "Letterboxing<br/>
<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;Special Forces" badge made up for all those hardy letterboxers who <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;brave the harshest New England winters, the destructive South East <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;hurricanes, the deadly West Coast earthquakes, the massive flooding<br/>
<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;in the Deep South, the winds of The Dust Bowl, the deserts and the <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;mountains in the west/midwest, and just plain old staying alive in <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;the suicide capital of America, the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;Warrior Woman<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;(now wistful for the temperate climate, verdant green moors, <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt;and "mists" of the UK)<br/><br/>

&gt; &gt;(and yes, I'm going next time FOR SURE)<br/><br/>

spent some of my day yesterday calling town clerk's in the towns I  have trips <br/>

want a random person to stumble upon the box.  A good example is the<br/>
recent case where a box in western NY State was discovered by a<br/>
civilian, taken to work where he bragged about his theft.  No amount<br/>
of coaxing by his fellow workers could convince him to return it.<br/>
Sometimes the park people aren't aware of the box and you want to keep<br/>
it under their radar.  Also, it takes away from the fun if a single<br/>
track leads straight to the box.<br/>

Dartmoor - if someone is determined to steal/ruin a box then they will<br/>
- after all the clues are hardly top secret and if I can follow clues<br/>
then i'm sure that a vandal/thief could.<br/>
