In The Chimney Letterbox<br/>
Placed by A-Bear on 1 April 2003.<br/>
Mercer Island, Washington<br/>
King County<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS: Take I-90 E or W to Mercer Island. Take<br/>
Island Crest Way exit, turn North, follow the "small<br/>
brown" signs toward Luther Burbank Park. Start at the<br/>
SE 26th St entrance parking lot (not the main entrance<br/>
parking lot!!!). <br/>
<br/>
TIME: Roundtrip 20 minutes<br/>
<br/>
DISTANCE: 3/4 miles roundtrip<br/>
<br/>
DIFFICULTY: Easy<br/>
<br/>
NOTES: Park is open from 8am-9pm (this may be<br/>
seasonal). This park is ideal for children &amp; pets.<br/>
There is an AWESOME playground (one of the best in the<br/>
area) and a nice little beach. Be cautious along a few<br/>
parts of the trail near the water.  I saw 2 bald<br/>
eagles soaring above Calkins Point letterbox when I<br/>
came to plant this one.  Awesome!!<br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  I need your help to free me for a breather<br/>
from this chimney.  It looked so inviting as I made my<br/>
rounds on Mercer Island that I had to jump in. <br/>
Unfortunately I got stuck and will let down so many<br/>
people in the world if you do not help me.  The best I<br/>
can tell from my location is that if you park in the<br/>
parking lot, follow the trail along the eastern shore<br/>
of this park along north to reach this chimney.  Once<br/>
you find the chimney towering high above you, stop at<br/>
that mushroom kiosk and head west up to the large tree<br/>
along side the bathrooms.  There is a black box on the<br/>
backside of the bathrooms which has the controls to<br/>
help me.  Complete your mission here and enjoy the<br/>
rest of your day knowing you helped bring gifts to the<br/>
world.  <br/>
