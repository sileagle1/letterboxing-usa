Location:  Near Beavercreek, Greene County, OH<br/>
Difficulty: Easy level path, 0.5 mile round trip<br/>
Geocache/Letterbox hybrid placed 15 Nov 2001<br/>
<br/>
This is another of my favorite fishing spots on the Little Miami <br/>
River. I often put my canoe in the water here and go to The Narrows <br/>
along the river.<br/>
<br/>
Parking is at US 35 and Trebein Road.  There are a number of trails. <br/>
All are flat, none are marked. The cache lies 50 feet off an East-<br/>
West path northwest of parking. My personal suggestion is to walk to <br/>
the river and then head north. The East-West path intersects this <br/>
path.<br/>
<br/>
The box is behind a Honey Locust tree (big thorns) with three trunks <br/>
about 20 paces due north of the trail.  It is marked as a Geocache <br/>
box. <br/>
<br/>
For extra credit, after finding the letterbox, go further north on <br/>
the river another little bit and see the place I was first going to <br/>
put the box. You will know you are there when you get nearly to the <br/>
bike trail.  The location was at the base of a large tree between the <br/>
path and the river. What a fishing spot this is! Nice bike path too! <br/>
Both of which means too much traffic, even in fall/winter. <br/>
<br/>
Cache/Letterbox contents include toys for boys and girls of all ages.<br/>
<br/>
Stamp your book, make a geocache trade if you like, and then kick <br/>
back with a pole and pull in a few rock bass. <br/>
