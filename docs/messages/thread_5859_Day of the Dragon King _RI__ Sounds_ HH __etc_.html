And just yesterday, Laurette, Dan and I biked the Kingston bike path and<br/>
found every note in the Hills are Alive series.  Great directions!  Who knew<br/>
there we hiking trails there? Not us!  Some of the paths were rough on my<br/>
street bike, even walking it.  We finished at dusk and the woods were alive<br/>
with fireflies.  One drawback: finishing late will require one to hike or<br/>
bike back amidst clouds of gnats. <s> All boxes were in place and in good<br/>
condition except for the one "down the steps" (Stairway to Heaven? <s>),<br/>
which was a little wet inside.  I felt that the series would be more fun on<br/>
foot, simply because there was very little biking between boxes, and some of<br/>
the path boxes required leaving the bikes behind.  The ride back was fast<br/>
and fun as the light disappeared, if you don't mind gnats up your nose. <s><br/>
BTW, we found a couple of hikers, too.  Too bad we didn't have a real Time<br/>
Machine that would turn the clock back a couple of hours for us, but the<br/>
Shore Birds flew away with us.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
&gt; For anyone heading to RI,<br/>
&gt; Day of the Dragon King is a great hike with a very cool stamp.  David and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; did this hike today (sans kids) and it took us 2 1/2 hours.  We saw all<br/>
kinds<br/>
&gt; of great things.  Beautiful woodland plants in bloom, a million baby toads<br/>
&gt; and even 2 great horned owls.  Bring bathing suits if the weather is right<br/>
&gt; because right when you are longing for it, the river rambles by.  Thanks<br/>
&gt; Trish for a great series.<br/>
&gt; Laurette and David<br/>
