1. Pinecone-needs new ink pad-lid was broken <br/>
2. Timberland Park-it is still the old misspelled stamp so I was <br/>
very excited to have it since the clues said it would be replaced <br/>
with the correctly spelled Timberlin park stamp--and by the way it <br/>
is a BEAUTIFUL Stamp!!!!!<br/>
3. Ball and Tee-sadly it was missing. I could see where it had <br/>
been and for sure it was gone- I was truly dissappointed <br/>
<br/>
We also found, purely by mistake, a geocache-in a very cool <br/>
hiding place.<br/>
<br/>
It was a GREAT Hike full of rocky ledges, hilly terrain, scary drop <br/>
offs and gorgeous overlooks, creaky old bridges etc. I enjoyed <br/>
the hike considerably and recommend it to any one in who hasn't <br/>
gone yet. I'm tempted to leave a new box or 2 on this cool trail.<br/>
<br/>
One word of caution- not good for small children, since path <br/>
follows rocky ledge for quite a while.<br/>
