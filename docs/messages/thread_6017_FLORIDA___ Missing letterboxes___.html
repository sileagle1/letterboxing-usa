Just an idea for you.  Why not make your letterboxes multi-part?  The <br/>
seeker would have to locate a few pre-indentified landmarks along the <br/>
path and email that info to you, then you could email back the final <br/>
resting spot of your box.<br/>

P.S.  We know what Kokopelli's treasure is ;)<br/>
