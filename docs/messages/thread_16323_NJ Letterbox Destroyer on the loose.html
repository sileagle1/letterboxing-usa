Sorry, I'm just getting caught up in my mail reading. You said the box was<br/>
under some train tracks, are they still in use? If so, could the vibrations<br/>
caused by a train going over have caused the box to come loose? Also, there<br/>
is no way to know if the person's who took the box were malicious or just<br/>
curious. Who knows, maybe they will visit the site, find out that the idea<br/>
is to *Leave* the box in place and then they will come back to return it?<br/>
Stranger things have happened :-)<br/>
