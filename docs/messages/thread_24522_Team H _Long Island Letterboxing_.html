and hope a Team H member finds this.<br/>
<br/>
Someone left a film canister with a purchased stamp in the spot where I have had a <br/>
letterbox hidden for two years.  I'm not sure if this canister is meant to be a hitch hiker or <br/>
something to take the place of my box while it had been removed for a short period of <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
See, I check all of my boxes regularly and recently a deer carcass was in the way of getting <br/>
to the box.  Rather than have boxers step over this decomposing deer, I removed the box <br/>
temporarily and noted it's temporary removal on LB.org and AQ.com..  Yesterday I received <br/>
an email telling me that all that was left were several bones.  So I returned the box to it's <br/>
location and found the canister.<br/>
<br/>
Team H had stamped onto a mini journal inside the canister. I'm not even sure if Team H <br/>
placed this here.  I would like to see if this is meant to be a hitch hiker, I will return and <br/>
place it inside my box and note that it is a HH.  Otherwise, right now, it is alongside my <br/>
letterbox. The canister does not have a "name" and lacks letterboxing qualities. It could  <br/>
be a geocache, but it also lacks certain tell tale signs of a geo.<br/>
