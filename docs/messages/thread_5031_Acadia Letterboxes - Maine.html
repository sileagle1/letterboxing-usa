<br/>
Sorry I can't give you an updates as to if the Acadia<br/>
boxes are still there or not (haven't been to find<br/>
those yet), but maybe I can help with your other 2<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
The beehive.  If I remember correctly, the climb is<br/>
not bad, but could be a bit hairy in a few places if<br/>
you have a fear of heights.  They have done a great<br/>
job at placing steel bars as steps and handles along<br/>
the way, though.  As I recall the hike is actually<br/>
pretty short and didn't take us to long to do.<br/>
<br/>
As to the black flies, well, there are probably as<br/>
many suggestions on how to avoid them as there are<br/>
members of this list!  Here are some I know of that<br/>
work pretty well - but everyone seems to be different.<br/>
<br/>
*Wear light colored clothing<br/>
*Eat garlic<br/>
*Get the B12 vitamin into your system<br/>
*The ever popular Avon Skin-So-Soft (though I never<br/>
found this to work to well).<br/>
*Pin a Bounce fabric sheet to yourself, or inside your<br/>
hat.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great trip...Acadia is a spectacular place to<br/>
visit!!!<br/>

<br/>
Bad advice!  I tried this twice, &amp; my nipple is still sore.<br/>
Another option to consider is the LL Bean Bug Suit.  I have one (used <br/>
once), which I can sell you for cheap.  It will keep anything with <br/>
wings from attacking you, but it also is very hard to see out of.  As <br/>
you walk along the trail, you may find yourself running into trees, <br/>
falling off cliffs, kissing a moose instead of your girlfriend, etc.  <br/>
This can be problematic.  But you can have it for cheap if you want <br/>
it.<br/>
The Avon Skin-so-Soft definitely works.  But who is the marketing <br/>
genious who came up with that name for bug repellant?  Also, be <br/>
advised that it will make you smell like a woman (which is fine if <br/>
you happen to be of that persuasion).  Also, you open up a whole <br/>
pandorra's box when you try to buy this stuff, as it involves calling <br/>
the Avon Lady.  Every few months, this annoying woman will barge into <br/>
your house &amp; spray you with all kinds of horrible substances.  You <br/>
will be unable to go out in public for several days after this (at <br/>
least if you are a guy).<br/>
Sometimes it is less hassle just to let the bugs have their way with <br/>
you.  Plus, a well-placed mosquito bite on the knee cap can be quite <br/>
pleasurable to scratch.<br/>
This is my advice, based on trial &amp; error.  Others will have <br/>
differing opinions, I'm sure.<br/>

Good luck!<br/>
And as for the black flies- walk fast- that's all you can really do.  : )<br/>

can tell you it was as fun climb! There are some spots<br/>
that seem a little bit freaky but you have plenty of<br/>
man made handholds, ladders, bars and ledges to climb<br/>
on to make it up safely! Many people do it and it is<br/>
rewarding at the top! I on the other-hand got up there<br/>
and hadn't checked out the Acadia clues so I didn't<br/>
know there was even a letterbox up there till i got<br/>
home! Oh well... it is a destination for me this<br/>
summer. Hope to see your stamp!<br/>

<br/>
I haven't been to Acadia since the early 90's (before LBNA was founded).<br/>
It's a great park!!!  So beautiful there.  I can't tell you about the<br/>
letterboxes, but I can say that while I was in Maine I saw plenty of the<br/>
state bird -- not black flies, but rather mosquitoes!  TONS &amp; BIG.  <br/>
<br/>
The regular Avon skin so soft may not work, but I can attest that the<br/>
Avon Skin So Soft all-in-one sunscreen, insect repellent lotion DOES<br/>
keep the bugs off.  Slather generously over exposed skin and they will<br/>
stay off you.  They will zero in on any section you miss, though!<br/>
(Exposed butt in the bathroom is fair game for these blood thirsty<br/>
creatures!)  I used to go fishing up in the North Woods of Wisconsin<br/>
where there are no shortage of mosquitoes or ticks and that stuff did<br/>
the trick for me!<br/>
<br/>
Keep on carving and letterboxing, Girlfriend!  YOU HAVE TALENT!!!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

Thank you for all your responses and tips.  I will go and search for <br/>
them, armed with the appropriate bug spray and applied everywhere <br/>
(thanks Amanda!).<br/>

Thank you also to twomainecats for telling me about the Ellsworth <br/>
