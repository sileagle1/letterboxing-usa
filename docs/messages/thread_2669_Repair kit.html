                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry it's taken us awhile to reply to the repair-kit string, but we <br/>
also carry along an extra tupperware with ziplocks and such for field <br/>
maintanence of the boxes we find. We are especially thankful to the <br/>
folks who have repaired (and even completely replaced) our <br/>
letterboxes. Making a count, we have "lost" 36 letterboxes, replaced <br/>
16, and abandoned 4.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the biggest reasons letterboxes go missing is the re-<br/>
hiding thing. I can't tell you how many boxes we've found that had <br/>
corners or even whole surfaces showing. We always take a minute <br/>
before leaving to double check that we've completely hidden the <br/>
letterboxes, and often add extra rocks to better-hide them. We also <br/>
scoop up a big handful of brushy leaves and twigs to scatter over the <br/>
site as well. Just a thought...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again to the folks who have fixed up our letterboxes!<br/>
