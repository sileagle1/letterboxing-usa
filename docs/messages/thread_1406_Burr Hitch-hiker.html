Great to hear of your journey up here.<br/>
<br/>
In case you have another day and a chance to read mail before you <br/>
leave the area, I can tell you that you want to use the old Maine <br/>
Junction - 0.5 miles up the Dear Leap Trail from the Inn.<br/>
<br/>
I'd be curious to hear from you off-list what number you came up with <br/>
for the McGrath's Pub box. Sorry you didn't find it. Sure you didn't <br/>
have Joe foam up your glass too many times while you plied him for <br/>
hints??<br/>

in the Rutland, VT library just giving y'all an update. The Burr Hitch-hiker has<br/>
travelled far! After finding it in Devil's Hopyard, I decided that we needed to<br/>
spread out all our hitch-hikers a little more. My, there are a lot of them out<br/>
there! <br/>
<br/>
Sarah Fearing (a.k.a. Vermonster) and I did some 'boxing the past few days to<br/>
include McGrath's Tavern (couldn't find it but I think we got the numbers<br/>
right). The 1st LBNA memorial box (very nice). Couldn't find the Maine Junction<br/>
letterbox... there was Some confusion with which junction we were really<br/>
supposed to be at. We did find the deer leap letterbox in the dark, soggy, foggy<br/>
woods. That was fun. But we couldn't see what was below. Not until the next day<br/>
when we drove past McGrath's Tavern and noticed Deer Leap directly above it! So<br/>
close! We then headed out, with Valley Quest Books in hand to traipse around the<br/>
town of Woodstock. Needless to say after bagging five of those boxes, we know<br/>
the layout of the town rather well. So, today, on my own I shall continue the<br/>
hunt or whatever "game that is afoot" and have explore Vermont. So, I<br/>
didn't want to tell anyone exactly where the Burr is but I did want everyone to<br/>
know that it did move far.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking about Hawaii next.<br/>

I took an early morning trip down to Sherburne Pass. Great view from <br/>
Deer Leap today. All four of the outdoor letterboxes were in place <br/>
and in good shape. But the McGrath's Pub box inside is missing. I'll <br/>
contact the owners and see if they know what happened to it.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe it wasn't a case of Guinness (or even a few pints, though I <br/>
hope you and Sarah were not totally abstemious!).<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have to look a little harder for my treat! I'm heading up <br/>
Mansfield tomorrow and will keep my fingers crossed..<br/>
