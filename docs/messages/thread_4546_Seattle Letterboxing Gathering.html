<br/>
John and I are definitely interested in a Seattle Letterboxing Summit on<br/>
March 9th!!!  Tell us when and where and you will see us.  I can carve<br/>
an event stamp.  I'd like it to be a stylized version of the Space<br/>
Needle.  If it ends up being in Tacoma though, maybe I'll have to carve<br/>
the Tacoma Dome or something.  I'd prefer Seattle since that's where<br/>
we'll be staying when we go up there.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for getting this together, Ryan!  Maybe we can meet Glenn and<br/>
Bill and Mischief and Catbird and Lizard and Candlelight, etc., etc.,<br/>
etc.  The more the merrier!!!  It will be good to see you and Amanda<br/>
again.  Too bad Funhog will be checking out the Sandhill Cranes or<br/>
whatever, on the Platte at that time.  Perhaps Mitch and Thom will make<br/>
an appearance.   OH WHAT FUN!!!  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
