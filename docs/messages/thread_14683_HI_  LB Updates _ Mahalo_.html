                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi--<br/>
<br/>
We recently returned from an incredible trip to two of the Sandwich <br/>
Isles.  Simply stunning!!!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the low down on LBing activities on O'ahu &amp; Hawai'i as we <br/>
experienced it.<br/>
<br/>
O'AHU--all 5 letterboxes were alive &amp; well and many had multiple <br/>
visitors from around the US.  We also found all 5 boxes with 2 young <br/>
children (one of whom was in a baby backpack).  I'd recommend, <br/>
however, if you have a fear of heights or children who aren't that <br/>
sure-footed to think twice about the Lanikai Bunker trail.  It's <br/>
quite steep &amp; rocky but takes you to incredible views of the <br/>
adjacent islands &amp; bays!!!  As for using strollers during these <br/>
treks, the only ones I think would remotely handle strollers would <br/>
be the two letterboxes at Makapu'u Point--it's paved most of the way <br/>
but there is a part where you would have to carry the stroller over <br/>
lava rock around a locked gate.  Once near the letterboxes, you <br/>
would have to park the stroller for a bit to actually find the <br/>
letterbox as some side trails are involved--not difficult if you <br/>
have two adults in your party one of whom can stay with the stroller <br/>
(that wasn't our situation during our visit--I was alone with the <br/>
kids while TRKEE worked).<br/>
<br/>
We left 3 little reminders in a few of our favorite spots in the <br/>
area plus an additional surprise for future LB'ers, too:<br/>
<br/>
-- 'Awapuhi-'ula'ula<br/>
-- Monk Seal (Tlio holo i kauaua)<br/>
-- Pueo<br/>
<br/>
These hikes aren't that strenuous but two do require some extensive <br/>
vehicular/bus travel to reach the trailhead.  Monk Seal is almost <br/>
entirely a flat hike but the distance is between 4 &amp; 5 miles with <br/>
one stretch of cliff hugging while clinging to steel cable <br/>
specifically placed there for hikers.  The views in the region are <br/>
stunning and wildlife abounds!!!  Pueo is about 1-1/2 miles with <br/>
fruit laden trees all around and some steep inclines at various <br/>
spots.  'Awapuhi-'ula'ula is a very popular spot about 2 miles in <br/>
length with some incline and muddy spots, too.  <br/>
<br/>
EXCHANGES:  We were extremely fortunate to have been able to link up <br/>
with two other letterboxers during our visit!  Mahalo--Stamphi &amp; <br/>
Hello Kitty for meeting with us along the way!<br/>
<br/>
HAWAI'I:  We ventured on to visit the breathtakingly beautiful &amp; <br/>
still growing Sandwich Isle.  What incredible vistas abound there--<br/>
encompassing 11 of 13 climate zones, too!  The only weather we <br/>
didn't experience this trip was snow (although it got pretty close <br/>
to the freezing mark a couple of times) and the only native animals <br/>
we didn't meet along the way were Humpback Whales and a few of the <br/>
endangered birds and turtles (although we did see a few <br/>
I'iwi, 'Amakihi, Honu &amp; Hone-ea).<br/>
<br/>
As for the two existing letterboxes on this isle--<br/>
<br/>
--We are sorry to report that the Hawaiian Mystery Letterbox exists <br/>
no more thanks to a wildfire that hit about 5 days before we visited <br/>
the area.  All that we could find while sifting through the ashes <br/>
was a charred sketch-book spiral-ringed binding to a log book.  <br/>
Otherwise, there was no other sign of a letterbox or its remnants <br/>
amongst 2 feet of ashes--even soda cans in the area were partially <br/>
melted--a testimony to how devastating this fire was (apparently set <br/>
by campers in the area).   <br/>
<br/>
--Puako Petroglyphs is alive &amp; well and quite popular.  Seems lots <br/>
of first time letterboxers with stamps have found it.  Pretty <br/>
exciting to see all the different stamps from around the country.<br/>
<br/>
--We left 3 little reminders for future LBers in this region, too <br/>
(all flower-inspired &amp; some of our best stamps to date IMH&amp;HO):<br/>
<br/>
-- Koki'o<br/>
-- Bird of Paradise<br/>
-- Orchid Isle<br/>
<br/>
All three of these 'adventures' are kid friendly and fairly short <br/>
hikes taking you to either great vistas or incredible geologic <br/>
formations that you wouldn't see anywhere else around the world!  <br/>
Simply incredible.<br/>
<br/>
While on the isle, don't forget to visit Mme Pele &amp; view her <br/>
incredible nighttime magmatic show if you are afforded the <br/>
opportunity!  We went twice and were absolutely awed!!!  Don't <br/>
forget to look up and gaze at the stars, while you're there <br/>
either.  ;)<br/>
