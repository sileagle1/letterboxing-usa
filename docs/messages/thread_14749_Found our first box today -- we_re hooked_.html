Went to do the Crosswinds Marsh, and found it with relative ease, <br/>

hike on the boardwalks through the marsh first, which was fine, <br/>
because its' BEAUTIFUL there - can't believe that's been in <br/>

used a commercial stamp today, but will be making our own soon. <br/>
<br/>
also may look into planting some of our own -- this is going to be a <br/>

we're a family of 5, three kids, ages 8, 3 (almost 4), and our <br/>
youngest will be 2 next week... this will be such a neat thing for <br/>
the kids to get involved with, especially as the younger two grow <br/>
older.<br/>

looking forward to getting to know you better!<br/>

I found my first box today too.  After almost dying of exhaustion and heat stroke at the same time!  It was all worth it though.  I have not felt this sense of accomplishment in years!!!  Wow.  I am now popping tylenol and resting from the trauma I have put my body through.  I realize that not all of these are difficult to locate, but man!  this one was difficult to get to without being able to fly like a superhero.  We found the one located at Meadow Mountain in Western Maryland.  So much fun!  I am glad to meet you and I am happy to know there are other beginners just like me and dragon fly that are excited about our new adventures.<br/>
