I pulled the Gilson Road box in Nashua, NH for repairs, replacement and <br/>
refurbishment today. The log was completely full, the stamp pad had dried <br/>
out, the label had come off of the mounting and there was no pen - too much <br/>
to take care of while sitting in my car! :)<br/>
I plan to replace it at some point later this week, probably within the <br/>
next few days.<br/>
