hours of this beautiful afternoon to find a few more of franzsolo and <br/>
Salamander's great boxes.  We managed to find LeOToO, Fred, A Rose By <br/>
Any Other Name, Taking 'Stock #1, 'Shroom With A View, and Grandview <br/>
Cemetery without great difficulty.  The boxes are all dry and in <br/>
great shape, the stamps are wonderful, and the locations beautiful.  <br/>
We've come to expect no less from these two.  Sadly, we were still <br/>
unable to locate Kick Up Your Heels but the brush has gotten nearly <br/>
inpenetrable - maybe we'll try it again in the fall.  We were also <br/>
disappointed that the Geometry Frog mystery box seems to be missing.  <br/>
We're pretty sure we had the right spot - has anyone found this box <br/>
lately???  Hope you all got a chance to box today!<br/>
<br/>

PS. We checked on a couple of our boxes today and were honored to see <br/>
that Wanda had stamped in on her way home last weekend.  Glad we <br/>
could add slightly to that awesome F number!<br/>
