The best reason to get the digest is that you get to reply calmly and <br/>
consider thoughts before posting.<br/>

I use the Mike Tyson rule. I post as if I'm talking to Mike Tyson and <br/>
he is within arms reach. Step over the line and he will rip my head <br/>
clean off and put it where the sun don't shine.<br/>

Ahhh! That's the point!<br/>
 Using inflammatory language in a discourse serves no useful purpose. <br/>
If you can put forth a reasonable point of view, and if the other <br/>
person then cannot comprehend and then resorts to flaming then they <br/>
tend to show their own intellect.<br/>
Case in point: If I said "Mike Tyson you are too stupid to understand" <br/>
he would get upset. Alternatively if I were to say "Mike Tyson can you <br/>
comprehend this written text?" there would be less likelyhood that he <br/>
would punch my lights out. The meaning can be there, but the way it is <br/>
received can be quite different, and the reaction back would be quite <br/>
different as well.<br/>

Too much work.  Tell it like it is.  You always get<br/>
alot farther whe someone knows exactly where they<br/>
stand with you.  <br/>
