                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, you did read the post correctly.  There is such a thing as a <br/>
duck blind--- v.s. a blind duck.  (Would be mighty hard for a quacker <br/>
to hold a cane under a wing..could crosswalks bre programmed to emit <br/>
a quacking sound to let blind ducks know they could safely waddle <br/>
across a busy street??). :-)  A duck blind is a wooden shed you enter <br/>
from the back. It is usually equipped with  benches inside and has <br/>
wide viewing slots in the front.  You sit in peace and quiet, looking <br/>
out at an isolated piece of our planet, usually near water or swamp, <br/>
waiting to see what hops, flies or walks by.  Hunters use them also.  <br/>
The last one I visited had a logbook recording what birds, etc. that <br/>
visiters had seen. <br/>
