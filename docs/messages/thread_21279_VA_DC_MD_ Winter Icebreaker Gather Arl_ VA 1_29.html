2nd Annual Winter Icebreaker Gather<br/>
Saturday, January 29, 2005<br/>
11:00am to 3:00pm or whenever<br/>
Pentagon City Mall Food Court<br/>
Arlington, VA<br/>
<br/>
Close to Metro, food, and shopping. With good parking (cheap).<br/>
Obviously this isn't a "boxing" gather but a meet, greet, and<br/>
exchange. There is one box there, though (please be Very discrete <br/>
with it), and there are drive bys close by. I especially hope to <br/>
meet new local boxers.<br/>
<br/>
I come early and grab a bunch of tables in the back. We exchange,<br/>
eat, and talk box. Some carving techniques might be shown. <br/>
<br/>
Agenda:<br/>
<br/>
10am - I, and anyone else, arrives early to grab tables in the back.<br/>
11am - Hellos and sig stamp name tag stamps.<br/>
Noon - (and anytime) food from the food court<br/>
All Times - Exchanges, event stamps, hidden stamps, event log, yak <br/>
show and tell.<br/>
1pm - Group picture.  Who's got a good camera?<br/>
1:15pm - possible stamp carving lesson (bring material and tools)<br/>
3pm - most people have wondered off<br/>
<br/>
Last year 30 people showed up, and 6 event stamps. (Just one event<br/>
stamp? Pshaw.) A couple of people are sending me stamps.  I will <br/>
introduce what I hope becomes a new traveling event stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
This is not official with the mall, just people meeting informally <br/>
in the food court.  No one hassled us last year but there is always <br/>
that possibility.  As long as we are buying from the food stalls <br/>
they shouldn't care.  They bring in buses full of tourists all the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and yes, the first treasure hunt is to figure out where, in that <br/>
big court, we are.  :-)<br/>
<br/>

...and it sure is icy out there.<br/>

I went to the mall yesterday at 1:15ish expecting to find the gathering in full swing but couldn't find anyone...A security guard told me you all had been there but got too rowdy and were asked to leave!  He said you went to Ballston mall--so off we dashed--but couldn't find you there either.  Not finding a gathering if worse than not finding a box!!  Sorry I missed you all.  Perhaps some other time...<br/>
