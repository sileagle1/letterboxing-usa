<br/>
I am new to letterboxing.  I do geocaching and I thought this would be <br/>
fun to add to it.  I have a question.  There are some that give clues <br/>
but do not tell you how to get to the location.  I have used map quest <br/>
but it tells you how to get to the town.  <br/>
<br/>
My question is after you get to the area how do you find the area the <br/>
letter box is in? <br/>
<br/>
The example is: you are in a town and it tells you to go to a <br/>
cemetery.  How do you get there with out map quest?  <br/>
<br/>
I have found two letterboxes at this time.  I find it as much fun as <br/>
geocaching <br/>
<br/>
Thank for your advice<br/>

research before you leave home.  Obviously you are already doing a little of<br/>
that, but I used to be terrible about printing the clues and then not<br/>
looking at them until I got ready to go hunting.  I think what finally<br/>
convinced me to begin reading clues ahead of time was when we went to<br/>
Oklahoma and went to look for a box that was behind some certain type of<br/>
tree.  I had no idea what that type of tree looked like, but I could've<br/>
easily found out if I had even realized I needed to know before we left the<br/>
nearest town!<br/>
<br/>
I bounce between three online map programs:  http://maps.yahoo.com/beta and<br/>
http://maps.google.com and www.randmcnally.com .   Quite often if you zoom<br/>
in closely enough one or all of them will show cemeteries and parks and<br/>
such.  You may have to pan around a bit, but they will show up.  If that<br/>
doesn't help, you can call the Chamber of Commerce or the local newspaper<br/>
and find out information.  Or you can google cemeteries in such-and-such<br/>
town.  If perhaps the town doesn't have a Chamber or a newspaper, I try to<br/>
think who would use the type of place I'm looking for and I'll call somebody<br/>
in that field (i.e. a cemetery might be frequented by a minister or a<br/>
funeral home, so I'll find churches and funeral homes in the area).  I often<br/>
use "research" as my reason for asking, which is quite true.  And often I<br/>
learn something interesting about the area too!<br/>
<br/>
Here's a box of mine that has the type of clue you would have to research<br/>
ahead of time:<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's part of the fun of letterboxing.  Sometimes you don't get nice easy<br/>
directions or coordinates.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If that's the style of clues that you prefer, then read thru the various<br/>
clues for your area's letterboxes and seek out the ones that give you<br/>
blow-by-blow directions to the exact, specific area.  Many placers do write<br/>
very specific clues.<br/>
<br/>
I don't prefer those types of boxes.  Too easy.<br/>
<br/>
I never ever rely on mapquest.  Mapquest makes too many mistakes.  I have<br/>
three different 5 and 6 county atlases for the Chicagoland area, not only<br/>
showing all the streets, but also all other types of landmarks -- schools,<br/>
churches, parks, cemeteries, etc.  I have state maps, I use google.earth for<br/>
an often quite beautiful aerial view.  If it's a cemetery I'm looking for, I<br/>
can quite often google the cemetery and come up with websites that will give<br/>
all sorts of information about that cemetery and many others as well.<br/>
There's even one website that lists coordinates for various U.S. cemeteries<br/>
that I would assume you could use with a GPS unit.<br/>
<br/>
Cemeteries are usually quite easy.  A great many of them will come up on<br/>
google.  And a good many atlases will show cemeteries on their maps.  And if<br/>
you use google.earth for aerial views, you can check the box to show<br/>
cemeteries and it'll often show them.  Only downfall, IIRC, is that it's not<br/>
just cemeteries alone.  I think google.earth has a box for something like<br/>
"churches and cemeteries" so you'll get the map crammed with all the<br/>
churches too, which can be considerable in some areas.  I also have a books<br/>
that lists thousands and thousands of cemeteries in the country, if not<br/>
millions.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you're a AAA member, they also have some really nice detailed maps of<br/>
areas that they give out free to members.<br/>
<br/>
There's also a software program called Microsft Streets &amp; Trips.  I don't<br/>
have a GPS unit, so I don't use that part of it, but it says that it has<br/>
"Advanced GPS features."  Since getting it tho, I haven't used it all that<br/>
much.  I've been much too busy playing with google.earth.<br/>
<br/>
I do as much research as possible before even leaving home because I never<br/>
know what little tidbit I might learn that might be a big help once I get<br/>
out into the field.  Next weekend I hope to have the clues to my two Judge<br/>
Judy boxes up and running and on my website.  It won't be hard to find<br/>
N.I.U., but a boxer just might find that they need to have learned a little<br/>
about N.I.U. library history before they begin their search.  Or they might<br/>
be a wee bit lost.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
We had one Thanksgiving box where Pippi just gave the name of the town and a<br/>
photo of a billboard.  The clues began from the location of the billboard.<br/>
It was up to the boxer to find the billboard site.  So they could either<br/>
google the company on the billboard and call them to try to find out where<br/>
they had put up a local billboard, or they could drive out to the area,<br/>
hoping to come across the billboard.  It was a small town, so actually quite<br/>
a few people in town, if shown the photo of the billboard, would probably<br/>
have been able to tell them at just what intersection outside town it was<br/>
sitting.  So some folks might just have asked around town.<br/>
<br/>
If the clues take me to a forest preserve, I never rely on just the clues.<br/>
I google and try to bring up as many maps as I can of that preserve's trails<br/>
because if I have a question once I get out there, it can be too late.  In<br/>
the northern IL area, Cook County forest preserve district and DuPage County<br/>
forest preserve districts generally have pretty detailed maps online.  And<br/>
there's a nice publication called "Chicago Wilderness" or something like<br/>
that that often has articles and their own trail maps on a number of<br/>
preserves.  Using google.earth to print out an aerial view of it can show<br/>
things that a map drawing might not.  And trails.com is another nice site,<br/>
but you have to pay to be a member to get some of the features.  Which I do,<br/>
because it's worth it to me.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes what I do might seem like overkill. But the extra work as paid off<br/>
well at times.  A boxer can never have too many maps.  :-)<br/>
