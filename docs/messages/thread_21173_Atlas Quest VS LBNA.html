I have noticed several people posting clues to Atlas<br/>
Quest but not to LBNA.  Is it intended for Atlas Quest<br/>
to replace LBNA eventually or just be another source<br/>
for letterboxes?  I have only used Atlas for my non-US<br/>
boxes and Hitchhikers, since LBNA does not handle them<br/>
well, but will add all my other boxes if that is where<br/>
most people are gravitating.  I don't want to have to<br/>
keep 2 sets of clues if I can help it and I would prefer<br/>
to have one site that is the main source for clues.<br/>
Wes, are you still going to make the changes to LBNA<br/>
you proposed last year or let it fade away?<br/>

<br/>
It's intended just to be another source for letterboxes.  LbNA, I have<br/>
little doubt, will always have clues not found on AQ just like AQ will<br/>
always have clues not found on LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don't want to have to keep 2 sets of clues if I can help it<br/>
<br/>
Either site can link to clues on the other site, so you shouldn't have<br/>
to keep two separate set of clues. The boxes would be listed twice,<br/>
but they would use only one set of clues.<br/>

While Gwen &amp; I have had some of the same concerns, we have linked <br/>
our clue sheets that are hosted on LBNA to Atlas Quest. The foreign <br/>
letterboxes are also at both locations, but AQ allows easier access <br/>
to those. With the linking from LBNA to AQ we only have one set of <br/>
clues hosted and they are at LBNA. We still prefer the "Contact the <br/>
Placer" function at LBNA to the notification process at AQ, but that <br/>
may be due to our usage of that function. The only other set of <br/>
clues we keep is a backup set in our Word program and a hard copy.<br/>

I have my own web site for all my clues and link to both sites.  I <br/>
use LbNA just cause it is the original source and I hold my <br/>
loyalties them.  Although AQ has all the bells and whistles that <br/>
LbNA doesn't and if it doesn't Ryan will add or change if it <br/>
benefits the group in whole.  Since Jay was able to help us get our <br/>
clues to appear I added the clues that were on AQ only.  As for <br/>
advertisements on AQ I didn't notice them till someone commented on <br/>
them.  I commend the Turtle for all his hard work and believe he <br/>

Not only are they much easier on the eyes, but the ads are relative <br/>

We totally agree. Ryan is a master! He also make posting finds and plants on <br/>
his site fun! You get blue ribbons and loving cups and stars if you take the <br/>
time to enter them. Nothing like a little instant gratification. And where else <br/>
can you read the hilarious rantings of the most infamous letterboxers but in <br/>
the personal profiles posted on Atlas Quest!<br/>

Just to set the record straight, AQ currently has over 3,000 letterboxes listed. Plus, <br/>
those who really object to the advertising there can pay an annual subscription fee <br/>
and have them wiped from their view. I only wish we could do that with the awful ads <br/>
on this Talk List!<br/>
<br/>
I, too, have my loyalities with LbNA, since I really love Der Mad Stamper's original web <br/>
design. However, there are features at AQ that I like a lot, too. I really like being able <br/>
to add photos to my clues that are hosted there. Regardless, I have my few AQ hosted <br/>
clues linked on LbNA and vice versa. If I felt that it was an "LbNA vs. Atlas Quest" <br/>
situation I'd surely stay with LbNA but I think the two sites complement each other <br/>
very nicely. Funhog<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 1) LbNA has a simple, comfortable look and feel,<br/>
&gt; 2) LbNA has many more boxes listed than AQ (13,000 <br/>
&gt; compared to 500?),<br/>
&gt; 3) LbNA does not have advertising, it's low costs are met <br/>

the mother site, I cannot imagine it being anything less.  I use both <br/>
sites and link to my website where my clues reside, it takes just a <br/>
few extra minutes to do the AQ listing and it's well worth it because <br/>
of the search by city option, not to mention the other great features.<br/>
<br/>
When I emailed Ryan about some things regarding AQ, he was very <br/>
helpful and I appreciated his well thought out logical approach which <br/>
I wound up adopting.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have trouble with Atlas Quest because, altho having all the different <br/>
categories is nice in the respect that it helps define for the potential searcher <br/>
whether or not it's a good box for *them*, I'm not always sure of the <br/>
categories.<br/>
<br/>
Whether the box clues require a compass or not, that's an easy one.  So is <br/>
whether or not it's a drive-by or not.  But for most of my boxes, I have <br/>
absolutely no idea how long the hike is in miles.  And for most of my boxes, I could <br/>
tell a person whether or not there's a rather extreme elevation change, but no <br/>
way could I tell what the elevation change might be for *most* of my boxes, <br/>
and even for the ones with an extreme elevation change, I wouldn't have a <br/>
number to put on it.  <br/>
<br/>
And the question about whether it's suitable or not for children always <br/>
throws me.  The category for children says, IIRC, that if the children box is <br/>
checked, that means the box is suitable for children ages 6 to 12.  Well, there's a <br/>
world of difference between the abilities of a 6 year old and those of a 12 <br/>
year old.  And even between two 6 year olds, there can be a world of <br/>
difference.  <br/>
<br/>
So I stopped using Atlas Quest to list my boxes because I really don't want <br/>
to mislead any searchers, and I'm just not good enough at deciding what boxes I <br/>
should check and what number I should put in.<br/>
<br/>
Plus I kind of like there being more mystery to it.  I kind of like figuring <br/>
I have to be prepared for anything and everything.  I realized that, for <br/>
ourselves, Keith &amp; I don't really *want* to know what the hike length is or what <br/>
the elevation change might be, or if we need a compass or not, etc.  It's always <br/>
kind of been my opinion that no self-respecting boxer should be caught dead <br/>
*or* alive without their compass anyway.  :-)  So each time I'd be trying to <br/>
figure out what boxes to check off, I'd start thinking "Hey!  Let the boxer go <br/>
out there and find out for themself!" :-)  <br/>
<br/>
The site is nice for keeping track of numbers, but we're likely to only check <br/>
our numbers once every 5 or 6 years anyway.  When we have visitors, I never <br/>
use numbers.  I'd much rather drag out all the scrapbooks of finds and plants <br/>
and bore guests to death *that* way.  :-)  And if Keith &amp; I want to empty the <br/>
house to turn in early for the evening?  Dragging out the scrapbooks does the <br/>
job famously every. single. time.<br/>

The categories are optional. If you don't want to include the<br/>
attributes or the hike length or elevation gain, just leave it blank.<br/>
 It's only for people who wish to provide such extra information.<br/>

Thanks for the kind words from most of you.  It means a lot!  I don't<br/>
expect AQ will ever make EVERYONE happy, so that's not really my goal,<br/>
but I do try to make it as useful to as many people as possible and<br/>
it's nice to know my efforts are appreciated.  =)<br/>

Happy trails!<br/>

I tend to check both sites. However, I agree that the AQ city search <br/>
feature is great...and I love the feature of being able to keep track <br/>
of your finds and/or plants. Of the 5 boxes I've found (I'm really <br/>
new to this), I've only been able to count 1 of them on AQ as a find <br/>
since the clues to the other ones are only on LbNA. I have been able <br/>
to count 1 as a hitchker as the hitchhiker itself was on AQ, but the <br/>
box it was found in was not.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, I am quite capable of keeping track manually in my <br/>
logbook, but it's just a fun feature to use to add to your "profile".<br/>
