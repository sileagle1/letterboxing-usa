                    <div class="plaintext-content">This past nine days, I've been wandering all over the PacNW with my <br/>
woobie, doing a whole lot of hiking and letterboxing. (Of course.  What <br/>
other reason IS there to travel???) :)  During these travels, I found a <br/>
few boxes are either missing or I didn't find them.  Just wanted to <br/>
report back to the owners/placers.<br/>
<br/>
SANTA ROSA, CA:  The Sugarloaf box is there and has a ton of signers!<br/>
<br/>
SANTA ROSA, CA:  The Silver Lake/Anandale box was not so lucky.  I <br/>
believe, since there's only one oak-shaded rock at 80 degrees, the box <br/>
may have been uncovered by a controlled burn that they seem to have done <br/>
(presumably to get rid of poison oak, which is on the other side of the <br/>
intersection).  The entire area was charred, and though I didn't find <br/>
evidence the box was torched, I also found neither hide nor hair of the <br/>
box at all.  I'm assuming the fire took out the foliage and exposed it <br/>
to the myriad of kids who drink there, judging by the beer cans that <br/>
looked fresh.  :P<br/>
<br/>
CRATER LAKE, OR:  Box is there, intact, and has a wonderful view. :)<br/>
<br/>
REDDING, CA:  The Riverside Rest dual-sided stamp and its box are there <br/>
and intact.  The path has been overgrown with blackberry vines (with <br/>
thorns!), and some stinging nettles.  Be careful! :)<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA GORGE, OR, LATOURELL FALLS:  Box is way gone.  I believe.  I'm <br/>
sure I was looking in the right place, and at the right bridge, but <br/>
there was no box that either Ben or I could find.  I think it may be gone.<br/>
<br/>
COLUMBIA GORGE, WA, BEACON ROCK:  I made it to the top, closing my eyes <br/>
tight and screeching across many of the wood-slat walkways where you <br/>
could see down between them to where your lifeless body would land if it <br/>
was to break while you're on it. (Did I mention I'm scared to death of <br/>
heights?)  I counted down, as requested, and there was no box that I <br/>
could find.  I checked both before the walkway AND after, just in case, <br/>
but I think it may be MIA. :(<br/>
<br/>
Two more sets of clues (one in CA, one in OR) coming tomorrow, after I <br/>
get some more sleep. :)<br/>

<br/>
As for Latourell Falls...that one shouldn't be too tough.  It's been a<br/>
long time since we did that one, as well.  In fact, if I'm not mistaken<br/>
we were the first to stamp in.  It's a great one to get, too.  <br/>
<br/>
Glad to hear the Crater Lake box is alive and well.  One of these days<br/>
maybe we'll get down there again and check it out!  Amanda placed it, I<br/>
think and I've yet to nab that one!<br/>

I'm inclined to think it's probably still there but lurking out of <br/>

may be awhile, since I'm traveling around Central America at the <br/>
moment, though.)  However, if you kept your eyes closed while hiking <br/>
back down the rock, maybe you missed counting a bridge or two.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Latourell Falls is a pretty easy box to find, so I'm inclined to <br/>
believe your report about the box being missing, but I'll go ahead <br/>
and double check that one too the first opportunity I get.  The last <br/>
report I got on it was early April, I think it was, when it was still <br/>
alive and well.  I thought it was hidden well enough that it wouldn't <br/>
be found accidentally, but we shall see.  If anyone else wants to <br/>
check up for me if they happen to be in the area, more power to you!<br/>

Did you ever try the one at UCD in Davis, CA ? It is a fun one to do.
