paragraph to  the new hiding place for the new Brick School House <br/>
letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
To find your box: Run around back just like a student in a hurry to <br/>
the outhouse.  Got to stand right in front looking at it . Then go <br/>
around the left side note the little window. Directly behind this in <br/>
the wall is a quartz type stone look closely before moving any stone <br/>
see corner of your box. your prize is here to stamp in . Please do <br/>
not move other stones only two need moving to claim your box Rehide <br/>
so it can't be seen  but the quartz can be seen.  Enjoy this historic <br/>
landmark preserved for all to enjoy. <br/>
