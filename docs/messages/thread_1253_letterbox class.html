&gt; I wanted to post a formal request for permission to refer the LbNA<br/>
&gt; website in my L'boxing class this coming weekend.  I have 8 new<br/>
&gt; letterboxers signed up for the class so far.  I am scrambling to get 4<br/>
&gt; boxes made and placed for the class.  I will post clues here as I intend<br/>
&gt; these to be permanent boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;From the website I would like to use the "about letterboxing" info that<br/>
&gt; I include in the boxes I place, and the URL for Letterboxing.org.  I<br/>
&gt; won't list any other clues than my own. I just want to direct the class<br/>
&gt; to the website to get other clues once they have completed the class.<br/>

<br/>
    You don't need formal permission to refer to www.letterboxing.org<br/>
because it is, and was intended to be, public domain.   HOWEVER,  please<br/>
make sure your students understand that the boxes, contents, and clues<br/>
belong to their individual owners and are NOT group property.  ALSO, it<br/>
is useful to point out the disclaimer.<br/>
<br/>
    It is always very nice to ask about using other peoples toys, land,<br/>
boxes, etc.  I am confident that your class will stress respect for the<br/>
hard work of others and the natural environment in which the boxes are<br/>
found.  Will you send us a follow-up on the class?  Perhaps your<br/>
syllabus?<br/>
<br/>
    Good to hear from you!<br/>
