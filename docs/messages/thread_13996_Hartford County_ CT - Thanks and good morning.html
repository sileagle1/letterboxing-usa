box in West Hartford to put the new stamp in.  I'm not yet sure who <br/>
will adopt this box, but we will let the webmasters know to make a <br/>
note.  Returning to boxes just to be helpful and nice must qualify as <br/>
a RAOLBK.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
On a completely different topic, the "V" for victory tree stamp is in <br/>
place as of yesterday for those who missed it.  Perhaps it took a <br/>
vacation, but it is where it was supposed to be if you wanted to take <br/>
another stab at it.   <br/>

expected.  Thanks for the nice stamp, but it is not hideous at all.  <br/>
I put an arrow on the back to show which way is up. I was the first <br/>
to stamp in with the new stamp.<br/>
<br/>
If you need some clarifications on the clues, I could help.  I had <br/>
to take a few educated guesses to find it, but it was not hard.<br/>
