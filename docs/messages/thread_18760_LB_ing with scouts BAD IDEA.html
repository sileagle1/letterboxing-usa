                    <div class="plaintext-content">I figured that subject line really caught your attention. I just needed to <br/>
post about what happened to me and my Presidential Series #1 yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I went out to do maintenance on my boxes. I removed the logbooks from the <br/>
first 4 and have decided to only put logbooks at the end of each 5 box <br/>
series. I completed the first series and went on to the second when I <br/>
realized I missed a box. When I went back to do that box, which was the end <br/>
of series 1, I found a group of girl scouts at the box. I said hi, helped <br/>
them locate box 3 and figured I would come back another day to update that <br/>
box. Well, it was sort of nagging at me to finish the series and I figured <br/>
the one box would take me about 10 minutes so at 7:00 last night I dragged <br/>
Max back into the woods.<br/>
<br/>
To my utter horror I found the last box laying completely out in the open. <br/>
No attempt was made to hide it. It looks as if the last girl stamped in and <br/>
in a rush not to be left behind just tossed the box on top of the spot the <br/>
box was hidden. The lid was partly off and nothing was in a baggy. So of <br/>
course I had to check the rest of the boxes. EVERY BOX was in similar <br/>
condition. Totally out in the open the lids off and in one box the stamp was <br/>
sandwiched between the ink pad and the ink pad lid with the top off the box.<br/>
Even the box I helped the kids find before I left them I said in front of <br/>
the leaders to make sure it is hidden the way it was before you leave. Sure <br/>
enough it was just set on the wall in plain sight.<br/>
<br/>
If I had not gone back last night my entire first series would have been <br/>
lost either by vandals or by the rain. Thank goodness they didn't look for <br/>
Aarons B-Day box, that is in such a high traffic area it wouldn't have <br/>
lasted until 7pm.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is ADULTS if you take kids letterboxing YOU ARE IN CHARGE! <br/>
You can not expect 7 or 8 year olds to re hide a box the way it should be. <br/>
If there are too many kids for you to control take less. If you don't have <br/>
time to do an entire series just do one box but teach kids how to care for <br/>
the box, hide it like it should be  and have some respect for the hobby.<br/>
Even Max, who is 6, knows what is expected of him in regards to other <br/>
peoples boxes and letterboxing etiquette. Every child needs to be taught <br/>
that.  I put allot of care into my boxes and I certainly try to treat other <br/>
boxes like I would have my own cared for. I hope others do the same. We <br/>
would lose a whole lot less boxes to vandals if we did.<br/>
<br/>
I just want folks to pay more attention to how they leave boxes before they <br/>
move on. And if you can't take care of them please don't do any of my boxes.<br/>

One of the things that really disturbs me about this<br/>
story is that one of the main purposes of scouting is<br/>
to teach young people responsibility and respect, as<br/>
well as to care for our natural surroundings (for Boys<br/>
Scouts anyway, and I'm sure for Girls as well).  How<br/>
did that scout leader promote that purpose?  Not well<br/>
at all.  I have this vision of half-eaten sandwiches<br/>
and discarded baggies laying somewhere in the woods<br/>
from a picnic they may have had too.  You are right to<br/>
put the burden on their adult leader though.  Most<br/>
scout leaders aren't that careless, at least the ones<br/>
I know aren't!<br/>
<br/>
As a scouter and a letterboxer, I hope (and believe)<br/>
that scouters have a lot to add to the letterboxing<br/>
world.  I hope that those of us who are in both worlds<br/>
are reminded by your experience that we have to take<br/>
an extra measure of care when we expose our scouts to<br/>
the workmanship and inspiration of other letterboxers.<br/>

stress that it most certainly was the Leaders responsibilty to make <br/>
sure the boxes were cared for and properly returned. Especially <br/>
seeing that these were very young kids to begin with. I also don't <br/>
expect from my 6 year old what I expect from my 16 year old or from <br/>
my 12 year old for that matter. However, the kids who are not taught <br/>
to respect the environment today are the ones you see tossing their <br/>
fast food garbage out the car window and emptying their ashtrays in <br/>
the parking lot tomarrow. <br/>

Interesting you mention this approach.  Several months<br/>
ago, there was a brief discussion about letterboxing<br/>
with scouts and several of us had done just what you<br/>
suggested.  <br/>
<br/>
For my part, we took cub scouts, which is a little<br/>
younger than the boys you work with I'm guessing.  We<br/>
went on a pack campout and boxed as one of the<br/>
activities.  There were two very good "real" boxes<br/>
right there in the park we were at, but my daughter<br/>
and I went a couple of days in advance and planted<br/>
five boxes.  We had stickers and a small notebook in<br/>
the box and the scout took a sticker and put in their<br/>
notebook and signed into our notebook.  We split the<br/>
group and sent them out in pairs with one adult per<br/>
pair and we very carefully explained how to do it<br/>
properly.  We gave each group a compass and showed<br/>
them how to pace. We also made sure the adults knew<br/>
the etiquette type rules of the game.  <br/>
<br/>
As they hunted, my daughter and I roamed and offered<br/>
our assistance and suggestions.  It became very<br/>
apparent who the good boxers were and who the "not so<br/>
good" ones were.  I think I would have a very<br/>
difficult time taking a whole group of scouts out to<br/>
real boxes, at least not until I felt they really<br/>
understood and could be trusted with the whole<br/>
process.<br/>

If you make it a game and the game is fun you can sprinkle in some learning and they will never know it. With Cub Scouts I would de-emphasize the competition and focus on the basics. But the key is to take the time to plant your own boxes, set up a course that is at the level of the kids. With the Boy Scouts I had them bushwacking. You plan a camp out and use it as a learning activity.<br/>

 We also made sure the adults knew<br/>
&gt; the etiquette type rules of the game.<br/>

Yes, I think this was an important part of how you worked it.  I too am a<br/>
scout leader (AHG) and I know the frustration of not being fully informed<br/>
about what I am expected to do.  I can also envision some  "warm body"<br/>
leaders (those who are just there to keep adult: child ratios in line)<br/>
strolling along and not really helping the scouts learn.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to read of the sad experience and thankful the boxes were recover<br/>
so quickly!  Might be worth dropping a line to the Troop if you have that<br/>
info handy, maybe offering to help set up a boxing lesson even.  A search of<br/>
the archives should yield some great ideas, such as Barefoot Lucy's and<br/>
several others.<br/>

I just recieved an email from a scout leader asking about a <br/>
letterbox. His specific question was how far of a hike is it to the <br/>
box. <br/>
Well, this is a box with pretty cryptic clues. However, in the clues <br/>
I direct you to a trail map (via an internet link) and in the clues I <br/>
give you the trail names and it's only 10 steps from a certain trail <br/>
intersection. <br/>
<br/>
So I directed this scout leader to the trail map (as I did in the <br/>
original clue) for him to determine for himself the distance to the <br/>
box. To be totally honest, It has been a year since I was at this <br/>
park and I have no idea how far it was to the box. It wasn't that <br/>
far, cause it only took me about 30 minutes to hide the box!<br/>
<br/>
I have had several questions from Letterboxers lately about clues and <br/>
all the information they needed was in the clues to begin with!! <br/>
<br/>
You have to READ the clues carefully and use all the information <br/>
given to you (trail maps and links to internet sites for parks)<br/>
<br/>
To me, that is what letterboxing is about! SOLVING A CLUE! IT'S A <br/>
MYSTERY!!! I can't give it all to you on a silver platter. I do that <br/>
plenty anyway with some drive-by boxes and tons of my clues are--go <br/>
here, walk 5 steps and look behind the tree. That gets boring after a <br/>
while. Some things in life are going to be a little more difficult. <br/>
Some things require that you think a little. That is a GOOD THING! <br/>

pretty easy.  I'm thinking that When/If I hide more I want to make them<br/>
progressively harder to find as I gain experience in hiding boxes and<br/>
writing clues.<br/>
<br/>
I don't expect all letterboxes to be easy, that would spoil the all fun!!!<br/>

&gt; I guess my point is ADULTS if you take kids letterboxing YOU ARE IN <br/>
CHARGE! <br/>
&gt; You can not expect 7 or 8 year olds to re hide a box the way it <br/>
should be. <br/>
&gt; If there are too many kids for you to control take less. If you <br/>
don't have <br/>
&gt; time to do an entire series just do one box but teach kids how to <br/>
care for <br/>
&gt; the box, hide it like it should be  and have some respect for the <br/>
hobby.<br/>
&gt; Even Max, who is 6, knows what is expected of him in regards to <br/>
other <br/>
&gt; peoples boxes and letterboxing etiquette. Every child needs to be <br/>
taught <br/>
&gt; that.  I put allot of care into my boxes and I certainly try to <br/>
treat other <br/>
&gt; boxes like I would have my own cared for. I hope others do the <br/>
same. We <br/>
&gt; would lose a whole lot less boxes to vandals if we did.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just want folks to pay more attention to how they leave boxes <br/>
before they <br/>
&gt; move on. And if you can't take care of them please don't do any of <br/>
my boxes.<br/>

I understand what you are sayiing completely.  I recently took my <br/>
Webelos (older cub scouts - 4th graders) letterboxing to several <br/>
easily found letterboxes that I scouted out a few weeks ago (Fish in <br/>
Outer Space series in Allentown, PA).  It is up to the LEADER to <br/>
ENSURE that the box is RETURNED to the proper place.  Anything les is <br/>
basic cluelessness and shows that the leader that had their <br/>
girlscouts there had NO control over their scouts.  This is BAD and <br/>
makes scouts look BAD.<br/>
<br/>
My bunch is very energetic (got some ADD kids here), but fortunately <br/>
I did have some other Dads with me to make sure that things did not <br/>
get too hyper.  Before we moved onto the next box, I made the guys <br/>
wait untill EVERYTHING was put back.  It's just common sense and <br/>
common courtesy.  "People take much time and effort to plant the <br/>
boxes, lets respect their work" was the message I hoped to teach.  I <br/>
think they got it and had a blast.  They reinforced some basic <br/>
compassing skills and were ready for more.<br/>
<br/>
The message is, if you take scouts letterboxing, you need to have <br/>
control over what happens.  Anything less is irresponsible.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I wasn't screeding too much....<br/>
