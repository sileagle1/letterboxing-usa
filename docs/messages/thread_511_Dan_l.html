This is or  should be a sad day for all the people in this group! It my wish <br/>
to be dropped from this mailing list ,for the only two people who ever tried <br/>
to help me understand this sport /hobbie are never heard from any more .<br/>
I think in timeyou will see that you let the heart of letter boxing get <br/>
ripped out and tramppled<br/>

<br/>
sorry you came to letterboxing at this time.  I am sad that Dan has<br/>
decided to bow out at this time.  This group has always existed on the<br/>
basis of a friendly, open exchange of ideas.  Recently some serious<br/>
issues have arisen.  We split off from another letterboxing group<br/>
because the site owner wanted to be able to print our clues and images<br/>
for money.  When we asked Dan to protect us from this very thing with a<br/>
simple copyright statement he balked even though a clear majority of<br/>
group members agreed with the premise of copyright protection.  I am not<br/>
sure why Dan does not want Randy or anyone else to house their clues<br/>
anywhere but on his site.  His technical explanation to me was not<br/>
especially convincing.  I have conversed with him offlist in several<br/>
e-mails.  I think he is very emotionally involved in letterboxing and<br/>
has a crystal clear vision of what he perceives letterboxing to be. <br/>
Unfortunatley, it does not seem to jibe exactly with what others<br/>
intend.  He does not seem to be able to compromise on these points.  I<br/>
think I speak for the rest of us who have been involved in<br/>
letterboxing-USA since its inception when I say that he will be sorely<br/>
missed.  He is a pioneer in this fledgling hobby.  Whatever he decides<br/>
in the long run, in my mind he will always be one of the great<br/>
letterboxers.<br/>

	I am very sad to see you feel the need to depart from Letterboxing,<br/>
especially as it sounds like it is related to the recent schism between<br/>
some members of the group.<br/>
<br/>
As for helping you understand this sport: none of us here are "experts"<br/>
- we have learned and developed our own methods and materials as we went<br/>
along.  In all liklihood, none of the US Letterboxers has ever been to<br/>
Dartmoor.  But, if you need ideas about how to get started, read the<br/>
"Getting Started" (which I wrote) and "FAQ's" (Randy's) pages of the web<br/>
page. And, if you still are unsure  about any aspect, ask on-line: you<br/>
will find all the help that you need. Or off-line, to any one of us -<br/>
people are pretty generous with their time.<br/>
<br/>
Yup, it is a sad day, in some respects, when Dan, one of the 'founders',<br/>
pulls up stakes in a sort of huff because certain 'terms' were not met<br/>
to his satisfaction.  It is sad that I was unsuccessful in the advice<br/>
and council that I shared with Dan - I spent literally hours trying to<br/>
talk thru the "issues", as I understand did others,  all of which fell<br/>
upon deaf ears. Nobody has ripped any heart out of letterboxing. It has<br/>
continued to grow, in spite of some rather petty "letterbitching" that<br/>
seems to rear its head from time to time. <br/>
<br/>
	If you REALLY have an interest in the sport, make a letterbox, go find<br/>
another, and share your experiences with the rest of us. It is, in the<br/>
end, about having fun, as so often has been said. Some here find<br/>
letterboxing fun, and enjoyable. Others may have other motives:<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 	".....  And if I rejoin it will be my responsibility to risk<br/>
&gt; mentioning "taboo" topics or not.  Personally, I cannot imagine<br/>
&gt; anything more of a crashing bore than only discussing finds, new<br/>
&gt; boxes and the weather.  So Erik, each person's boredom is quite<br/>
&gt; subjective." <br/>
<br/>
There you have it. You be the judge.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dan conveys his desire to drop out of the letterboxing scene, stating that...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; my simple reason for doing<br/>
&gt;  this (mainly that having a single moderator is not acceptable<br/>
&gt;  to me and that everyone should have a guaranteed and enforcable<br/>
&gt;  equal opportunity to express their opinion within the equal context<br/>
&gt;  of whatever rules are adopted).  <br/>
<br/>
I'm not going to dwell on this, but wanted to point out that we do not have a <br/>
single moderator, and that any actions taken in regard to Dan were done so <br/>
after consulting with many members of our group, and were a direct result of <br/>
numerous complaints about his long, argumentative postings.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally made several attempts to ask Dan privately to stop making issues <br/>
out of non-important things, and to put a halt to his plans to exclude <br/>
certain letterboxes from our website.  Dan made it clear to me that he was <br/>
not open to compromise. He seemed convinced that he had the right to make <br/>
rules for the hobby since he had volunteered his webspace to house our clues.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that opportunity for expression is very important, which is why a <br/>
vast majority of the members of this group were not in favor of Dan's actions <br/>
to exclude certain letterboxes from the website, or to control the content or <br/>
difficulty level of clues.  The growth of letterboxing in North America has <br/>
been a group effort, and should not be controlled by any one individual <br/>
(myself included).<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I have other things to do besides pick up the pieces and try to <br/>
organize a group to take over where Dan left off, but I'm doing it anyway <br/>
because I love this hobby, and I don't want to see it abandoned.  I want to <br/>
see future decisions being made by the entire group, not by a webmaster or <br/>
moderator.  I have no interest in being the dictator or owner of our website. <br/>
 It belongs to all of us.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I would appreciate it if you<br/>
&gt;  mention to them that whatever ideas or material I have contributed<br/>
&gt;  or created are their's.  I do not consider my ideas or material<br/>
&gt;  to be in any form other than gift-form (from me to them).  But I<br/>
&gt;  absolutely insist that they do not in turn claim ownership of it.<br/>
&gt;  I insist that they let it remain free."<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of these sentiments, all clues and artwork belong to their <br/>
creators.  Responsibility for the placement and accuracy of clues is also on <br/>
the shoulders of the person who places the box.  Volunteering to do <br/>
data-entry for this organization does not entitle me or my colleagues and/or <br/>
predecessors to insist anything about your clues.  All works published on the <br/>
group's website are, by default, copyrighted and protected unless <br/>
specifically declare otherwise.  No webmaster can take away these rights or <br/>
determine after-the-fact that inclusion on the website assumes that you have <br/>
given up these rights or donated your work to the public domain.<br/>
<br/>
I have already said more than I wanted to.  I hope this issue can come to a <br/>
close.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your patience,<br/>
Mitch<br/>

&gt;This is or  should be a sad day for all the people in this group! It my wish<br/>
&gt;to be dropped from this mailing list ,for the only two people who ever tried<br/>
&gt;to help me understand this sport /hobbie are never heard from any more .<br/>
&gt;I think in timeyou will see that you let the heart of letter boxing get<br/>
&gt;ripped out and tramppled<br/>

Well, Sherri,  I can't agree with you that the heart of letterboxing is in<br/>
any individual.  The Letterboxes that have been placed here have very<br/>
little to do with the list, but it is a fun way (when it IS fun) to<br/>
communicate our new adventures.  That there are disagreements is not very<br/>
surprising--it happens in every community.  I regret that they are painful<br/>
enough that people feel a need to depart, but it's an individual choice.<br/>

&gt;  I think I speak for the rest of us who have been involved in<br/>
&gt;  letterboxing-USA since its inception when I say that he will be sorely<br/>
&gt;  missed.  He is a pioneer in this fledgling hobby.  Whatever he decides<br/>
&gt;  in the long run, in my mind he will always be one of the great<br/>
&gt;  letterboxers.<br/>

Thom,<br/>
I couldn't agree more.  As most of our long-time members know, Dan and I had <br/>
become very close.  I considered him to be a friend, even though we only met <br/>
in person on one occasion.  We shared many intimate details of our personal <br/>
trials and tribulations, and often wrote to one another on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
I do not understand the motivation behind his recent statements, and I regret <br/>
that I was forced to take a stand against his intended actions.  There is a <br/>
hole in my life that has been left by Dan's absence, and I am not happy about <br/>
this.  I think he just let his aspirations for the website get in the way of <br/>
what was best for the hobby.  He had great ideas, but was going to have to <br/>
eliminate some of us in order to make them work.  This was not an acceptable <br/>
alternative.<br/>
<br/>
Dan is most definetely one of the pioneers of American Letterboxing, and I <br/>
hope that someday he will rejoin our group.  If and when that happens, I <br/>
assure you there will be no hard feelings on my part.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Mitch Klink, "Der Mad Stamper"<br/>
