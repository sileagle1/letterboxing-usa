    I tend not to make much change to how a box is hidden.<br/>
I believe it is up to the box maker to decide how "protected" he wants it to<br/>
be.<br/>
If we all "leave it as we found it", the box placer's intentions should<br/>
carry through.<br/>
    I recently located a box that was only known to be in a general area.<br/>
It would have taken<br/>
a LONG time to make a detailed inspection of the area so that fact that it<br/>
was only "tucked away"<br/>
made for a reasonable search.<br/>
    That said, today I was supposed to find a box hidden under a "small<br/>
cairn".  I found the box but no cairn!<br/>
I put a couple of small rocks overhead because I belive that honored the<br/>
placer's intention.<br/>
    Another factor is snow (I hope).  Rocks, sticks, etc. can freeze<br/>
together and make for difficulty in locating<br/>
and/or extracting.  While we were hiding our FIRST box today (clues coming)<br/>
I chose a protected alcove<br/>
but tried to leave an opening that would not disappear after a moderate<br/>
snowfall.<br/>
    Actually, that brings up an important question.  Are we supposed to stay<br/>
away from boxes when a snow<br/>
cover exists.  One's tracks can make things way too obvious...<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's true that if everyone left it as it was found, all boxes would <br/>
remain covered just as the placer covered it. But it only takes one <br/>
slightly careless hunter to make the change.  Bruce &amp; I prefer using <br/>
one large rock to cover the box whenever possible, as we feel this <br/>
makes it easier to re-cover, and we often check our cairn-covered <br/>
placements.  In the case this weekend, one box was propped up against <br/>
a tree with a couple rocks (uncovered on the top) but when I pulled up <br/>
the box and tipped forward the rocks, there was a perfect box-shaped <br/>
imprint in the dirt below. I thought it looked obvious that the box <br/>
should have been nestled in the imprint, and covered with the rocks. <br/>
Another was wedged between several small loose rocks, again uncovered <br/>
on the top, but it was pretty easy to cover it thoroughly with those <br/>
same rocks. I only wanted to remind everyone to be vigilent, it's a <br/>
sad thing when our hand-carved stamps and imprinted logbooks disappear <br/>
or are damaged. Same goes for snapping those lids on tight--water <br/>
often obliterates the wonderful messages people leave.<br/>
<br/>
As for Winter hunting, it's all a chance. We searched for the Giant's <br/>
Hip box in March with a foot of snow on the mountain....left tracks <br/>
everywhichway mainly because we had to do a lot of searching, and <br/>
still didn't find it. But there are many boxes which are just a step <br/>
off of a trail.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails and warm ears to all,<br/>
