Well, with apologies to Randy for impuning that he "missed" the second<br/>
box at Ninigret Pond...it's also disappeared. (New rule: if Randy<br/>
couldn't find it, it ain't there). I'm really surprised about that one<br/>
since it was way out at the end of the world and really BURIED, but it<br/>
was kind of in 4-wheelin-budweiser country. So, if you're planning a<br/>
visit this way, re-download the clues for Ninigret Pond (replaced/moved<br/>
to a safer spot), Bay of Bristol (replaced/moved back a bit farther off<br/>
the trail), and Fast Passage (third box abandoned).<br/>
<br/>
And finally, we may have to decommission the Old Bridge Letterbox in<br/>
the Conanicut Island Series: the towns on either shore of the bridge<br/>
have voted against turning it into a bike path/fishing pier and it is<br/>
scheduled for demolition in the next year or so. If anyone is planning<br/>
on searching for it in the next couple of months, please let me know,<br/>
and I'll postpone un-placing it.<br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays to you all! Jay<br/>

As for the quote &gt; (New rule: if Randy<br/>
&gt;  couldn't find it, it ain't there).,well, "It ain't NECESSARILY so". but I admit, he is pretty clever. <br/>
<br/>
Sad as always to hear of missing boxes. As was said earlier this month,<br/>
keep 'em simple low cost, and easy to replace. And maybe more difficcult<br/>
clues?<br/>
<br/>
Best to all for the holidays. Stay safe.<br/>
