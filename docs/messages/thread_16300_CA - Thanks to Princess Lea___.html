It is not wrong, it just bummed me out.<br/>
I guess it is a free letterboxing world and you all can put all the <br/>
physical restictions on your boxes you want to. I am sorry I brought <br/>
it up. It will waste my time to even read the clues. I do feel <br/>
finding the boxes using the attempt clues are restrction enough and <br/>
that is the pure letterboxing, not having some outside (non <br/>
letterboxing) hoops that you need to jump through prior to the <br/>
attempt itself. You hide it, post clues, we get clues, go find it. <br/>
Simple.<br/>
<br/>
IT is Unfortunate that people are disabled, are ill or have chronic <br/>
maladies with chemicals that render them as weak middle earthlings <br/>
in a way that no human wants our blood, or organs.   Hopefully such <br/>
pre-qualitfying restrictions will not become too popular in <br/>
letterboxing.  I do have 4 GPS units at my disposal, and I work them <br/>
better than my compass. I guess I can always go fetch stuffed <br/>
animals instead :(<br/>
<br/>
SO go ahead restrict on --- the kids will dig adult only restictions <br/>
on boxes too!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Despite the fact that there are some posts on this thread from people that I<br/>
truly admire and respect among letterboxing enthusiasts. I am going to jump<br/>
to the podium here in Maddogs defense.  First let me use my editorial skill<br/>
and explain that I do in fact understand the reasoning and the logic behind<br/>
such a letterbox, as well as I understand the incentive here to get others<br/>
that might not donate blood to do so.  However, I think there are some<br/>
important things to keep in mind.  So far letterboxing is a sport that in my<br/>
opinion has bridged a gapped that most others have not. Young and old alike<br/>
letterbox, those in great physical condition (such as Ryan) vs. those of us<br/>
that huff and puff our way up Mountains (like myself) or those of us that<br/>
skip a box totally because of a bum knee (such as Sir B).  However in these<br/>
circumstances the letterboxer is choosing whether or not to attempt the box<br/>
based on the physical difficulty of a trail, and it is a rational and<br/>
understandable notion that some trails are harder than others and that<br/>
different letterboxers enjoy different levels of difficulty.  Personally in<br/>
what I have seen so far in my time on the list and my time being an active<br/>
member of the letterboxing community I would say that so far we have done a<br/>
good job of keeping out the taboos that tend to ruin any organization or<br/>
group, religion, politics, etc. etc.  When it comes to difficulty of terrain<br/>
and such you all might recall my campaign months ago to get a little more<br/>
responsible in our clues and in or difficulty level setting and prepare<br/>
everyone for what they would meet when heading out. That campaign sent<br/>
several people into a blurring anger. (For whatever reasons I am not going<br/>
to talk about today).  I see that somewhat happening again as Maddog steps<br/>
up to say hey this might not be a good idea folks. We have seen it happen a<br/>
few times, some people got bent out of shape and offended at the notion of a<br/>
Purple Heart Award, others and The Medal of Honor award.  I see Maddog's poi<br/>
nt of view on this.  I personally am a blood donator myself, and to be<br/>
honest, there are enough rewards and benefits out there for blood donors.<br/>
That I personally do not see the need to create a letterbox made<br/>
specifically for them, restricting others who cannot donate.  I totally<br/>
agree with Ryan, not all letterboxes are for all people, and most are not<br/>
wheel chair assessable and some of the kid safe boxes are boring.  But I<br/>
also agree with Maddog that those restrictions on other people physical<br/>
abilities is quite enough without adding things like you have to be a blood<br/>
donor or and organ donor to get the box.  I also understand Maddog's<br/>
viewpoint that such a thing could be depressing and discouraging to those<br/>
that cannot donate for medical reasons.  It is hard to be reminded that you<br/>
are sick sometimes.  I am not usually one to be politically correct, but I<br/>
do think that taking the time considers other peoples feelings is always<br/>
something good to do.  Lastly my suggestion would be, why not make a box<br/>
that encourages donating blood, that inspires one to do it, but that doesn't<br/>
require that one do it beforehand or in order to get the letterbox?<br/>
<br/>

Just my few cents<br/>
