                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're a bit biased, but try Odetah Campground in Bozrah. Its about a <br/>
20 minute ride to mansfield. Extremely nice, clean facilities for <br/>
tents, as well as sites with full hook up and grey water.  There's a <br/>
letterbox at the entrance and several nearby (I.e. Bailey's Ravine, <br/>
and really any of the bozrah and lebanon boxes).  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone else is coming in from out of state and needs suggestions, <br/>
email us privately and we can give you a list of camps from our very <br/>
large (i.e. puts the yellow pages to shame) campground directory! <br/>
