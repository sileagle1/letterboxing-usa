ok -- I've been doing some thinking (again -- always dangerous) and I am <br/>
wondering if we started off heading in the wrong direction!  I didn't figure <br/>
out the part about the "diner" which must reference the picnic area.  So, <br/>
maybe we crossed the dam the wrong way!  That would make the box a little <br/>
harder to find!  So, with map freshly faxed over by the Park Service, I am <br/>
wondering -- does one cross the dam from east to west or west to east?!  <br/>
This could be a break through!<br/>
<br/>
I didn't realize your clues were so clever!  Are we on the right trail now?  <br/>
Thanks!  BeMa<br/>
