                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Jesman Bologna<br/>
<br/>
I was moved by your sad and saddening tale...<br/>
<br/>
A box vandalised..a box desecrated, even !<br/>
<br/>
Such terrible deeds surely broach no palliation.<br/>
<br/>
As a Dartmoor Letterboxer of many many years do please let me assure you<br/>
that <gasp> It happens here too !<br/>
<br/>
We call such Visigoths and Vandals "Sabs" ..as in saboteur...<br/>
<br/>
And indeed it is because of such fiends that the clues to many Dartmoor<br/>
Boxes are circulated by WOM (Word Of Mouth) rather than by listing their<br/>
locations in the various sheets and catalogues that we use over here !<br/>
<br/>
The loss of a a box ..and especially its wanton destruction can be<br/>
heartbreaking.....but please I beg you...Pause and count your blessings....<br/>
<br/>
We have a true and wonderful hobby which joins like minded happy souls<br/>
across our tiny planet...<br/>
<br/>
The price we must pay for this joyful pursuit is occasionally to bear the<br/>
losses made by those folk who have a much much smaller imagination ...and<br/>
probably a sadder life than we do !<br/>
<br/>
And the actual price of a box is after all only a few dollars at most <br/>
<br/>
So the loss is momentary...not even monetary <g>...and it is sadder for<br/>
Sabs than for us...because the box did have a life and spirit for a<br/>
time...and the Sabs can never take that away....<br/>
<br/>
(I am sure you recall all your box finds with pleasure....so what was it<br/>
precisely that triggers that happy memory?...I would argue it is that very<br/>
spirit and life we Letterboxers imbue in our hidden treasures..)<br/>
<br/>
In fact I could argue, that for us all, having a name and a life and a<br/>
spirit for even the shortest of moments is all any of us can ever ask for !<br/>
<br/>
So I beg you...No call to arms !<br/>
<br/>
Instead......A call for peace.....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps even the placing of a "Sabs" box in memory of boxes gone to that<br/>
"Dartmoor in the Sky"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do be exultant that you are a happy Letterboxer...<br/>
Do enjoy boxing....<br/>
It is sad that some folk miss the point....<br/>
But be happy that Letterboxing works as well as it does...rather than let<br/>
the very few despoiled boxes sour your fun...<br/>
<br/>
If you do...The Sabs are winning....<br/>
and what a sad lot they must be....<br/>
<br/>
So Please again...<br/>
No more calls to arms...<br/>
Better a call for Joy and Peace...<br/>
<br/>

delay, defection, or demise of the presumed "Dartmoor Exchange".  I <br/>
