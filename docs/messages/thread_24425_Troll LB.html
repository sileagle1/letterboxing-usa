repair, that i had taken it home with me and then brought it back all <br/>
better. since that time, i had been searching for the owner, but no one <br/>
has stepped forward to claim it. i had contacted Choi about it and if i <br/>
remember correctly, he said there was no record of this box on LBNA. <br/>
until the day someone cliams that box as thier own, we may never know <br/>
who the owner is.<br/>
