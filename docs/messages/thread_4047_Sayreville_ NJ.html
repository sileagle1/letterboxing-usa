<br/>Wanda &amp; Pete,
<br/>
<br/>We were there a couple of days after that, so I guess we'll just have to go back and give it another try one of these days.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>We also checked on our Cannonball stamp in Ramapo last week and saw you had been there.  Neat.  I guess you're finding driving in NJ not so bad after all.
<br/>
