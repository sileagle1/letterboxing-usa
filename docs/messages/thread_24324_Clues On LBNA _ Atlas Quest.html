I do agree with this - it is better to have clues listed on both sites.<br/>
But out of respect shouldn't we practice what we preach. We are asking <br/>
people who prefer AQ to log their clues on LbNA as well. Before we ask <br/>
them to do that shouldn't we list our clues on AQ first. I noticed <br/>
that Silver Eagle wants all clues on LbNA but he has only four of his <br/>
boxes listed on AQ. I feel it is disrespectful to demand something of <br/>
others that we aren't willing to do ourselves. I usually check both <br/>
sites when I am looking for clues because I know there are people who <br/>
prefer one site over the other. If and only if we are willing to list <br/>
on both sites can we ask others to do the same.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't see that respect or disrespect has anything to do with it.  Nowhere in the post does Silver Eagle "demand" that people log their clues on LbNA, or even ask that they do it.  He gave a point of information to those who might want to put the clues on both sites that it will not happen automatically from AQ.  <br/>
<br/>
  In view of the fact that both sites go down from time to time, it is nice to have the clues listed independently on each site.  But nobody's mandating that people have to do that, or even list their clues on line at all....<br/>
