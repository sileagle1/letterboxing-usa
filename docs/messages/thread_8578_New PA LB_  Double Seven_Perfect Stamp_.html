NAME:  Double Seven (Perfect Stamp)<br/>
       First Box in the Nolde Forest Series<br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Nolde Forrest Environmental Education Center, located on<br/>
           PA Route 625 south of Reading, Berks County, PA.<br/>
<br/>
DATE PLANTED: October 2002<br/>
<br/>
Nolde Forest Environmental Education Center is designed and <br/>
maintained to promote environmental education.  Bicycles and <br/>
motorized vehicles are not allowed. Please hike only on designated <br/>
trails. All route choices use existing Fire Roads, Trails, or Paths <br/>
(FR/T/P).  All boxes in this series are located close to trailsides. <br/>
All routes involve elevation changes. Maps of the center are not <br/>
entirely accurate.<br/>
<br/>
START HERE:  Sawmill Parking Area just off PA 625.<br/>
<br/>
Double set of clues to this box.  One route choice is a little longer <br/>
but more leisurely.  The other is shorter, but steeper. <br/>
<br/>
1. Longer, Leisurely<br/>
<br/>
Stand facing 270 degrees with the Double Wooden Bridges near the <br/>
parking lot at your back. Of the four main directions of the compass, <br/>
one is the most appropriate heading (MAH) for this box.  Follow the <br/>
Fire Road/Trail/Path (FR/T/P) at this heading. Ignore (FR/T/P)'s <br/>
coming into it on the right and left, cross a wooden bridge, and turn <br/>
right until you reach a Y near the Double benches. Bear right, noting <br/>
the name of the (FR/T/P) you are now on. Continue on this (FR/T/P) <br/>
until you reach a place where it Doubles itself near the Double cans <br/>
and the Double "cans".  Continue at MAH on the (FR/T/P) that Doubled <br/>
itself until you reach a Y.  Go left at the Y, leaving this (FR/T/P), <br/>
then immediately right.  Continue on this new (FR/T/P), passing the <br/>
four DOUBLE red slashes, and find this spot(S):  FF and EE and LL/PP <br/>
and EE.  Near this find OO (Double letters) followed by a number. <br/>
Note this number (N) and return to S. Now follow the (FR/T/P) at a <br/>
heading which is ninety degrees less than (MAH)  for N divided by <br/>
three paces until you see the Double Horses at 215 degrees and  the <br/>
Tall Pine at 120 degrees. Look between the Double Logs in the area <br/>
between the Double Horses and (FR/T/P) to find Double Seven.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2. Shorter, Steeper<br/>
<br/>
Stand facing 270 degrees with the Double Wooden Bridges near the <br/>
parking lot at your back. Of the four main directions of the compass, <br/>
one is the most appropriate heading (MAH) for this box.  Add 90 <br/>
degrees to MAH and follow the Fire Road/Trail/Path (FR/T/P) in that <br/>
direction until it meets another.  At this junction, follow the <br/>
(FR/T/P) at MAH until it meets another (FR/T/P).  Turn left and <br/>
continue, ignoring three (FR/T/P) coming in on your left, and <br/>
ignoring one (FR/T/P) coming in on your right.  Pass the Buckeye PP <br/>
on your left; ignore the (FR/T/P) coming in on your right, and catch <br/>
sight of Double Yellow to your right. Continue and find this spot(S): <br/>
FF and EE and LL/PP and EE. Near this find  OO (Double letters) <br/>
followed by a number. Note this number (N) and return to S. Now <br/>
follow the (FR/T/P) at a heading which is ninety degrees less than <br/>
(MAH)  for N divided by three paces until you see the Double Horses <br/>
at 215 degrees and  the Tall Pine at 120 degrees. Look between the <br/>
Double Logs in the area between the Double Horses and (FR/T/P) to <br/>
find Double Seven.<br/>
