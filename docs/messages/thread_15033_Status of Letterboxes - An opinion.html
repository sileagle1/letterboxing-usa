ideas.  It is just my opinion regarding my own letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
When I have been emailed or seen on the list that someone has been <br/>
unable to find one of my few boxes I have made a point to visit that <br/>
box within a couple of days.  The same box has been reported missing <br/>
accurately and inaccurately.  When it was indeed missing, I added <br/>
that note in bold letters to the clues on the LBNA site.  As soon as <br/>
I replaced the box, I removed the note.  <br/>
<br/>
If I am headed out to look for boxes distant from me I make one last <br/>
check of the site and sometimes will email the placer, just to be <br/>
sure.  If I go and can't find the box, I will email the placer again, <br/>
ask if it is still there, explain where I have looked and ask for any <br/>
help the placer is willing to offer (all done off list).  All boxes I <br/>
have found, I have emailed the placer off list - except for one that <br/>
was placed by children who I thought might get a kick out of seeing a <br/>
post about their box on the list.  <br/>
<br/>
All this being said, I guess I am on the side of having fewer rather <br/>
than more places to check things out - though I understand why some <br/>
people would find the new database useful.  Perhaps part of my <br/>
feeling on the matter comes from the fact that after my first four <br/>
boxes, I don't think I have found any others on the first try!  I <br/>
agree with those who have commented that it makes the final discovery <br/>
that much sweeter.  In a society which is used to instant <br/>
gratification, I enjoy the challenge of having to work for those <br/>
foolish little stamp images!<br/>
