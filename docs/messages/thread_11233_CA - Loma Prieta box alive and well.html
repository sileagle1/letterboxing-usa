                    <div class="plaintext-content">I made the trek to the Loma Prieta epicenter a couple of weekends ago and can report that the box is alive and well.  A word to the wise for anyone planning on making this hike during the "winter" months - as the directions explain, you will have to park farther down from the entrance gate, and this adds 1.5 miles each direction to the length of the hike (for 5.2 overall).  The last bit of the hike on the creek trail is very primitive, and requires two crossings over a small river.  It was running quite high due to recent rains, and at one point I just took my shoes off and waded across as the stepping stones were all submerged.<br/>
<br/>
Ass a bonus for my efforts, I found my first hitch hiker!  It was Legerdemaine's Golden Goose and it has been sent on its way already.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Let me try the math again!  It's actually 7.4 miles roundtrip (2.2 each way on the hike, plus 1.5 each way for the "extra" part).  Also, you can bike the first part - there's even a little bike stand that the junction to the creek trail where you can secure your bike before entering the last 1/5 mile or so of more treacherous hiking.<br/>
