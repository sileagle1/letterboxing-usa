<br/>
Located near the NC/SC state line, the nearest town is Fort Mill, South<br/>
Carolina, nearest city is Charlotte, North Carolina. Allow about one hour<br/>
for this easy round-trip letterbox hike.<br/>
<br/>
For general information &amp; driving directions to the greenway, go to:<br/>

<br/>
The Anne Springs Close Greenway is a 2,000 acre nature preserve located just<br/>
minutes south of Charlotte, North Carolina. This natural gem includes<br/>
historic Catawba Indian trading paths, railroad right of way, fishing<br/>
opportunities, primitive camp sites, swinging foot bridges, horse, biking &amp;<br/>
hiking trails. <br/>
<br/>
A small day use fee or yearly membership fees apply.<br/>
<br/>
Once you get to the Greenway, park near the Field Trial Trailhead near the<br/>
Field Trial Barn. Take the trail to the right after you pass the trailhead<br/>
marker. Pick up a trail map if you want one. You will see a fork<br/>
immediately; go right on the lesser-used path.<br/>
<br/>
Follow this path through the fields until you see a grove of trees on your<br/>
left. You will see paths to your left and right and ahead of you. Take the<br/>
path on the left, which will lead you down between two ponds (though in the<br/>
summer, you may not be able to see the pond on your right through the<br/>
trees).<br/>
<br/>
You will come out into a clearing. Cross the clearing, and straight ahead of<br/>
you, you will see a trail marked by a yellow flag. Take this trail, but<br/>
watch out for horse droppings!<br/>
<br/>
When you come out of the woods again, you will see a gravel road. Take this<br/>
road, going right. Eventually you will come to a fork; go right and follow<br/>
the road until you see the creek and the train trestle over it. Walk down to<br/>
the creek and find the path on your left. Take this path through the woods<br/>
along the creek until you see the swinging bridge on your right. Cross the<br/>
swinging bridge, and look underneath the bridge on the far side to find the<br/>
letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
You can retrace your steps on the way back, or you can take the path going<br/>
straight up the hill once you re-cross the swinging bridge. When you come to<br/>
a fork, take the path going left, which will bring you back to the road. You<br/>
can follow the road back to your vehicle.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
