home in Pt Defiance in Tacoma WA.  I invited him home and subjected <br/>
him to yet another eating of Dungeness Crab ( we Puget Sounders have <br/>
no sentiment when it comes to this, Right Amanda?)<br/>
<br/>
Today 12/21 I visited Burfoot County Park north of Olympia.  I made a <br/>
bargain with myself.  I would allow myself to go LB'ing in the A.M. <br/>
only if I would then get my shopping done after.  I remembered that <br/>
the Olympia Farmers Market had plenty of gift buying potential,foods <br/>
and treats galore.<br/>
<br/>
Plus I had to get rid of the Crab Pot.<br/>
<br/>
I left the crabby friend but encountered a pesky "Buzz the HH" at <br/>
Fudricks "Bur" Box in this park.  As Hoopoes love to eat Bees I <br/>
thought it wise to get him a new ride ASAP.  I left him in a new spot <br/>
but now worry as there are birds there too.<br/>
<br/>
I went to DVN2R SKR's  Big Foot where I found an old friend, "PSYCO" <br/>
HH.  We met before at the South Puget Sound Quest Fest where I helped <br/>
him escape from the area of the Mental Hospital.  Since then he has <br/>
encountered the same people over and over ( must have been the <br/>
mushroom he ate)  So I will give him a ride to a large city nearby <br/>
where he might encounter some festive Holiday folks.<br/>
<br/>
Four boxes and 2 HH at one venue.  Neat park, nice Nature Trail with <br/>
good signs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy First Day of Winter everyone!  It only took 1/2 hours at the <br/>
farmers Market to find the perfect and most unique gifts for the <br/>
folks on my list.  Plus a Marzipan pastry for me.  My new car is all <br/>
flaked out with filo.  I hate shopping, but this was too easy.<br/>
<br/>
Ah the price we pay for Letterboxes.<br/>

     We, too, ventured down to Burfoot to locate Fudrick's new boxes <br/>
today.  I could only imagine what was going to be on those <br/>
stamps!!!  I wasn't too far off base when I actually saw the stamps--<br/>
what a hoot! Thanks Fudrick!!!<br/>
<br/>
      It was a big HH day for us, too!  Bagged Buzz &amp; The World's <br/>
Crabbiest HH in the same park!  Well, technically TRKEE bagged Buzz <br/>
and we bagged Crabby.  Buzz has since flown on to more mysterious <br/>
places these days.  We have officially finished our first log book <br/>
(although there are 9 carved stamps logged in there that haven't yet <br/>
been placed--stay tuned for future letterboxes in a park near <br/>
you)!!!  <br/>
<br/>
     After finding the boxes, we headed to the beach at low tide!  <br/>
It was awesome!  There were clams, oysters &amp; sanddollars of all <br/>
shapes &amp; sizes all about (Bent Neck &amp; Butter Clams were most <br/>
prolific).  We even found remnants of an octopus and other <br/>
interesting sea creatures lying along the rocky shore.  Western Jays <br/>
were abundant as were the Pileated Woodpeckers and many other neat <br/>
little birds.<br/>
<br/>
     After Burfoot, we, too, headed to the Farmers Market for the <br/>
last hurrah of the season!  What a fun area to hang out in!  Too bad <br/>
it closes for the season tomorrow.  :(  April is TOO far off...  <br/>
Then, we continued on to other places for more Christmas shopping!  <br/>
I guess letterboxers think alike?  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox fever<br/>
Careful, you might catch it!!!  ;)<br/>
