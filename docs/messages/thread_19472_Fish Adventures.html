I placed the Fish Adventures letterbox in Great Falls this past <br/>
spring.  I hiking in that area quite frequently, so I am always <br/>
checking on the box.  I was there over the weekend and discovered <br/>
that the box was gone.  The last time I was there, I know somebody <br/>
left a hitch hiker and put my microbox into the large hitch hiker <br/>
box.  I was wondering if somebody took the hitch hiker box and maybe <br/>
took my Fish Adventures microbox too?  Otherwise it is possible that <br/>
the box was found and confiscated (and that would truly be a <br/>
shame).  I haven't been monitoring the listserve for a few months <br/>
now, so I am sorry if somebody posted about this box already.  I <br/>
might just have to carve a new stamp and re-hide it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
