<br/>
	Sunday we hiked to the "Top of Slide" (NY) letterbox and after crossing<br/>
on top of about 1/8 mile of 2-3 foot hard packed snow  on the trail we<br/>
arrived at what should get the "worst letterbox spot" award. Next to a<br/>
"scrubby tree" (you'd be scrubby to if you grew at over 4000 ft above sea<br/>
level) was the flat rock that covered the letterbox.  What a terrible<br/>
place for a letterbox!  The foot deep snow was about a foot away. The<br/>
tree warmed a dry circle about its base which included the LB.  Well it<br/>
was damp inside (WET) and the only person to find it was a "mountaineous<br/>
high land camper" who found it by accident last year 7-24-04 or so. So<br/>
the next time we get up there , I will probably replace/repair/move/leave<br/>
it alone??? Who knows what  anyone would do up there where the air is so<br/>
thin and clean?  <br/>
<br/>
	Anyway today we checked  one at the ground level. The "Bridge to<br/>
Nowhere", right here in Mt Tremper .  It's A ok , Just waiting for some<br/>
lucky LBer to stamp in and see how Mr. Frog weathered the Winter. {not<br/>
good either}<br/>
<br/>
	On another front,  I have got to get over to that Rocket and find that<br/>
LB placed in "my back yard"...........................<br/>
<br/>
Mombo Jumbo:<br/>
	"The Budster"  will be getting his fur cut soon and that will make him<br/>
ready for outdoor LBing in the warmer weather.<br/>

P.S.  Interesting responses to some of my e-mails,  will reply in the<br/>
near distant future, when I grab it from the JUNO computer when I access<br/>
it .........................<br/>

'Top of Slide' sounds like a fantastic LB!  Sometimes it's not the <br/>
destination but the journey.  You should carry it as a jewel in your <br/>
book knowing that FEW others willever make the difficult journey to <br/>
claim that prize!<br/>

You didn't say this was your box and it reads as though it is not. I<br/>
hope you don't think that you have any right to remove or move this box.<br/>
