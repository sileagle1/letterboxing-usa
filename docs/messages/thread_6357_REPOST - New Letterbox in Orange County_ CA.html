Fullerton, Orange County, CA<br/>
<br/>
My wife graduated from Cal State Fullerton some years ago and to honor <br/>
her and the mighty Titan Men's baseball team, my daughter and I placed <br/>
a Letterbox near CSUF.<br/>
<br/>
To get there, take the 57 Fwy. and exit at Yorba Linda Blvd.  Go just <br/>
a bit west of the freeway to Associated Road.  Before turning north on <br/>
Associated, look to your left at Titan Stadium and admire the banners <br/>
for the three College World Series Baseball Championships won by their <br/>
Boys of Summer.  Not bad for a commuter school!  They've even placed a <br/>
few men in the NBA (remember Cedric Ceballos with the Lakers?).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, go north on Associated until you get to Rolling Hills Drive.  <br/>
Turn right there and then take the first right onto Hartford.  Make an <br/>
immediate left on Treeview, go to end of the street and park in lot <br/>
for Gilman Park (one of several entrances to the park).  From the <br/>
parking lot, follow the small stream to a wooden footbridge.  Cross <br/>
over it and follow the trail up a small hill.  Follow the trail to a <br/>
second footbridge until you see a playground that looks like it is <br/>
made out of old mining equipment (an odd playground design, but it <br/>
attracts a lot of kids every time I go there).<br/>
<br/>
At the far end of the mining play area is a tire swing and a rather <br/>
large Pepper Tree with four trunks (maybe three, with one very large <br/>
lower branch).  Take the trail to the left and go up the hill.  As you <br/>
walk up the trail, you will notice four Gum trees growing in one spot <br/>
directly in front of you.  Before you get to them, the trail will veer <br/>
right.  Look for the light post on the left of the trail.  Walk 8 <br/>
paces past the post and you'll find a palm tree placed rather <br/>
incongruously there with the Titan box amongst the branches at its <br/>
base.  WATCH OUT FOR THE SPIKEY BRANCHES ON THE PALM!  The stamp is <br/>
the Titan logo.<br/>
<br/>
At that point, you could take the trail about 100 yards to another <br/>
park exit, or go back to the play area and take a ride on one of the <br/>
many tire swings.  Gilman Park is small and oddly placed, but locals <br/>
know it as a green oasis amidst a county trying very hard to pave <br/>
itself.  Despite the freeway noise, it still offers a peaceful place <br/>
to walk the dog and relax.  When you are done, drop in at the <br/>
Arboretum at CSUF - a surprisingly beautiful place for a short walk <br/>
and then grab some Joe at a favorite spot for juicing up: Rock 'n' <br/>
Java on Harbor Blvd., just south of Brea Blvd.  If you're hungry, go <br/>
to Birch Street in Brea and try the Milanesa at the Gaucho Grill.<br/>

WAIVER OF RESPONSIBILITY AND DISCLAIMER <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing, like any outdoor sport, carries the risk of unforeseen <br/>
hazards.  "Letterboxing North America" supports a policy of not <br/>
knowingly placing letterboxes in areas that will create undue risk to <br/>
the letterbox hunter.  However, as conditions may vary, it is the <br/>
responsibility of the letterbox searcher to become thoroughly familiar <br/>
with the conditions in the area to be searched, to adequately prepare <br/>
for those conditions, and to conduct oneself safely and responsibly <br/>
with respect to those conditions and with respect to his or her <br/>
personal abilities and limitations.  "Letterboxing North America" and <br/>
the individual letterbox sponsors assume no liability for events which <br/>
may occur related directly or indirectly to one's searching for a <br/>
letterbox.  <br/>
