You will need to flip the image, but you don't need a price-y program<br/>
to do that. In fact, many word processing programs--including<br/>
Word--allow you to import an image and flip it in the document.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, there are free graphics programs, and you can use any<br/>
of them for this kind of simple flip.  See download.com or tucows.com<br/>
and see what graphics programs are available for free download.<br/>
<br/>
Worst possible case, take the image to any Kinkos and have them run a<br/>
photocopy that's reversed.<br/>

Oh well, if anyone does want to reverse an image, you've seen my tips<br/>
on how to do that with little or no expense.<br/>

<br/>
Hi CPAScott, and anyone else interested,<br/>
<br/>
I have found an easy way to work with images, that I wish someone would have told me when I first started, it would have relieved a LOT of frustration, especially trying to carve words so that they come out correctly and not backwards.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want any image you have, words included, to come out as a stamped image exactly as your printed picture shows, this is an easy trick......<br/>
<br/>
First, you have the image, printed off the computer, from a magazine, a line drawing, whatever, the image and words are the correct way as you see it, and you want them to come out that way in a stamped image without having to go through a reversal process ending up with a mirror image instead of the way you wanted, and with no tracing....well, sort of! <br/>
<br/>
Just do this, take a very dark pencil and trace the image....but not onto a piece of tracing paper, just draw right on the image itself, following all the lines in the pattern that you want, and eliminating or not drawing over the ones you don't.  When you are through, you will have your original image, with your pencil markings drawn all over it....no other pieces of paper.  Place this drawing, pencil marking side down, on top of the rubber that you are going to be carving for the image.  Now use the back of a carving tool, or something rounded to rub vigorously over the back of the image.  While you are doing so, the pencil markings are shifting from that piece of paper, to the rubber, so be sure to hold the paper carefully in place.  Be sure to cover the entire area of paper so that all of your image is transferred.  <br/>
<br/>
When this is done, peel the paper off the rubber, and presto, instant image ready for carving.  Now, when you look at the image on the rubber stamp, all the features are going to be reversed, mirror imaged, including any words. This is what you want, because when you carve it, and then stamp with it, the stamped image will print out the way you wanted it!   If you don't get it all, you can realign the paper image back onto the rubber, and go back over the areas you missed.  Easy image transfer without figuring out reversal programs, etc. <br/>
<br/>
But, if the REVERSE image "is" what you want. You can sort of do the same thing but it takes a few more steps.  Trace your drawing as stated before, and transfer it to the rubber as before.  Its backwards now, and will stamp correctly, however, you want to go over those pencil marks on the rubber now, and "stamp" that first image in rubber onto a new piece of rubber.  Now when you look at the second piece of rubber, you will see that the image is stamped correctly meaning that it appears the same as the original drawing, so, you know that when you carve it and stamp it, its going to come out reversed!  <br/>
<br/>
I don't have access to programs that do all of this for me, and when I am in a hurry, this is actually much faster than  dealing with stopping my carving activities to get on the computer and switch things around.  Also, I do not feel that I "freehand" stuff well enough yet to take on projects where I just start carving!  So this works great for images I have from other sources as well as images that I have drawn myself.  Hope it helps, I have taught my kids how to do this, and they are thrilled with the results, as am I :)<br/>

&gt; paper, just draw right on the image itself,<br/>
&gt; following all the lines in the pattern that you <br/>
&gt; want, and eliminating or not drawing over the ones<br/>
&gt; you don't.  When you are through, you <br/>
&gt; will have your original image, with your pencil<br/>
&gt; markings drawn all over it....no other pieces <br/>
&gt; of paper.  Place this drawing, pencil marking side<br/>
&gt; down, on top of the rubber that you are <br/>
&gt; going to be carving for the image.  <br/>

&gt; What about smudging?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In art school the Interior Design folks taught me this trick.  <br/>
Although I'm not sure what it will do to the non-graphite image.  <br/>
A very little lighterfluid on a kleenex and then gently dab/rub over <br/>
the graphite.  It make it less smudgy.<br/>
<br/>
But I trace onto vellum sheets with a Sharpie, then graphite right <br/>
over it covering it completely.  When I flip to transfer you can see <br/>
image thru vellum and get the mirror effect for carving.<br/>
