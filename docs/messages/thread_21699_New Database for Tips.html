Hail all! I decided to start a new database on our site for tips from<br/>
other boxers, check the links:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/database<br/>
<br/>
Then I won't be sending out long winded messages again! Go and post<br/>
your best tips for others there and they can be saved in one place<br/>
rather than having to search hundreds of emails to find them! :)<br/>

Hi Cap'n<br/>
<br/>
If you check out Atlas Quest "Code of Conduct" or Silent Doug's site <br/>
or Mark and Sue's site you will find a heck of a lot of information <br/>
already posted regarding dos and don'ts, security as well as some <br/>
ethics.<br/>

There's always a new tip or suggestion that can be made.  My thought <br/>
creating the Code of Conduct was to cover the 'important stuff'.  <br/>
Little things like "Don't forget the sunscreen!" I figure could crowd <br/>
out the more important things like "If you see a bear, do not rub <br/>
honey on your face to get it to lick you."  (Okay, I didn't say it <br/>
quite like that--it was more on the order of "Use common sense!" or, <br/>
as General Hardass might phrase it, "Don't be STUPID!!!!")<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I'm not sure a new database just for tips is particularly <br/>
helpful.  First you've got to get people to use it, which I'm not <br/>
really inclined to do myself--ANOTHER thing to follow?!  Then, even if <br/>
someone does post a good tip, there's not always agreement about if <br/>
it's a good tip or not.  And, heaven forbid, if you get hundreds of <br/>
tips listed, who in their right mind will read every single one of <br/>
them?  You start losing the trees for the forest.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.  *shrug*  Doesn't hurt anything that I can see, but <br/>
I don't think it'll be especially helpful either.<br/>
