                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think asking people to commit to something that they haven't seen is too<br/>
much.  I mean, I'd like to get a patch or something, but I'd like to know what<br/>
it looks like first.  But, I also think that there's nothing wrong with<br/>
stickers.  I have tons of stickers for outdoor gear companies and clubs.  I<br/>
put them on my water bottles, my mountain bike helmet, on everything.  It's a<br/>
great way to get outdoors people to notice something, and it's less expensive<br/>
and easier to do.  Especially for something that's just an "I'm a<br/>
letterboxer".  I'd get a ton of those, just to stick them everywhere :)  <br/>
But for recognition, a sticker isn't really feasible.  But I think there's too<br/>
many aspects of recognition, and at this rate, everyone is going to have there<br/>
own patch.  I'm sure everyone puts a lot of effort into their clues and<br/>
stamps, and even picking a perfect spot.  Hey, I'm working with a handicap<br/>
here, I'm in New Jersey!  How about I get a patch for putting a box where you<br/>
can't see or smell a landfill!  I mean, every box I look for out of this state<br/>
is in a beautiful location.  I think these things are too open to<br/>
interpretation.  I mean, if you like someone's stamp or clue, why don't you<br/>
just say thanks for a great hunt in a great spot?  That's recognition.  I only<br/>
have one patch, and it's for volunteering for trails.  I've never put it on<br/>
anything, I don't want it to get wrecked.  But stickers, there's always more<br/>
stickers :) And if you don't want people in the mall noticing letterboxing<br/>
(which I'm not sure why, unless you guys get people from Staten Island at your<br/>
mall too, then I can understand), then stick it on something you use outside,<br/>
ie. a trekking poles, water bottles, dog packs.  <br/>
So, in short  :)   I'm for stickers.  <br/>
Oh, and for membership.  I don't think we should have a membership fee to get<br/>
a patch.  I mean, that's all we're gaining.  We can still look for boxes, and<br/>
only have to pay park fees :)<br/>

I too am in agreement with the patches idea.  I think<br/>
a patch for all of us memebers is great.  Then maybe a<br/>
patch for us who have 25 boxes placed/found, then 50<br/>
to 100 to 150 to 200 etc...<br/>
Patches also for carving, clue making, etc... those<br/>
could also be created.  Yet don't we all create our<br/>
own stamps and clues?  These might be given if someone<br/>
finds a clue interesting or challenging.  Or maybe if<br/>
the spot for placing the box was perfect.  The person<br/>
who found the box could recommend the owner of the box<br/>
for a patch.  See what I'm saying?  <br/>
The pins would also be cool for a milestone.  Yet what<br/>
would be considered a milestone.  <br/>
