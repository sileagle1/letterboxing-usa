                    <div class="plaintext-content">I see a way to alleviate one controversy of said cheese racing, i.e., <br/>
that it is a disgrace to cheese lovers everywhere.  C'mon - can you <br/>
really call those plastic coated yellow slices cheese?  That is what <br/>
is the disgrace to cheese lovers.  They (the ersatz cheese, not the <br/>
cheese lovers) should be incinerated.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we have cleared that up, we should all be of one mind and in <br/>
perfect harmony on this subject. The only questions left for <br/>
discussion are technique and equipment.  <br/>

Ya'll are a strange bunch!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
So do you eat the cheese after the race, or what?  Are there any <br/>
delectable recipes for post-cheese-racing competitions?  <br/>
