Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I geocache as well as letterbox.  I like the hunt, with or<br/>
without the technology; going to places I've never been before,<br/>
directed by someone I've never met...I love it.<br/>

I've been geocaching for 3 years.  I tried letterboxing a couple of<br/>
years ago and was intriqued.  I got stamps from Central Park on a trip<br/>
to Manhattan and then placed a letterbox hybrid geocache in my<br/>
hometown with the same stamp book, hoping to introduce something new<br/>
here.  However the box (with stamp and book) were muggled and<br/>
disppeared.  I recently accidently found a LB right next to a geocache<br/>
near here and my interest in LB has been renewed.  Here in UT there<br/>
are MANY more times the number of caches than LBs.  I can't see myself<br/>
getting into the stamp carving (not at all artistic), so will probably<br/>
never be considered a real LBer.  I'm not clever enough to come up<br/>
with great LB clues, etc.  Plus there are not many LBers around here,<br/>
so none of the fascinating games I've read about in the East.  What I<br/>
love is the hunt and placing caches for others to find and sending out<br/>
travel bugs to roam.  It's a kind of "communication" which can be<br/>
anywhere on the scale from anonymous to known.  While it is true that<br/>
there are a lot of junky caches out there, many have really fun trades<br/>
in them.  Like in LBing, cachers build a reputation for themselves<br/>
with the quality of their caches.  Of course, a GPS receiver is<br/>
required for the geocaching and not for LBing.  I get the feeling that<br/>
LBing is more cerebral and artistic.  I have different trail names for<br/>
LB and caching.<br/>

I'm not very artistic at ALL either, but I love to carve.  The way I <br/>
do it it doesn't feel like it requires any artistic ability.  I <br/>
decide what I want to carve, and then search google images for one <br/>
that looks carveable.  Is that a word? lol.  <br/>

We have been geocachers for almost 2 years now and have just started seriously <br/>
letterboxing. We have planted a couple of letterbox hybrid geocaches but cachers either <br/>
load them up with trade items or don't do them at all. <br/>
<br/>
We have decided letterboxing is more gratifying in that you can see something that <br/>
someone created (a stamp) while still getting out and seeing new places. Letterboxing <br/>
clues, because they don't have the coordinates to rely on, are usually a lot more fun and <br/>
challenging.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question about the P/F/X etiquette reguarding geocache letterbox hybrids. Do <br/>
they count toward letterboxing? My personal log has both at this point. <br/>
<br/>
We will be planting our first *real* letterboxes soon.<br/>
<br/>
We use the same trail names as we do as geocachers,<br/>

We gave geocaching a try, but I really don't need to clutter up my<br/>
pack with stupid McDonalds toys or similar trinkets, and the "leave<br/>
nothing, take nothing" is, well, a lot like Letterboxing without the<br/>
stamps (stamps, especially homemade ones, are pretty neat).  We find<br/>
letterboxing clues more fun to follow than a beepidy-beep, and the log<br/>
books are more interesting to read too--at least in my limited<br/>
experience.  Though the story of the minivan driver who trashed his<br/>
undercarriage trying to drive up to the Ice Caves in Locks Mills Maine<br/>
was very amusing (you'd just have to know us to "understand" <wink>).<br/>
<br/>
So now, we only letterbox, or hike for the simple enjoyment of hiking.<br/>
