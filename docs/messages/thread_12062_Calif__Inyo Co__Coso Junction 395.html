 Heading north on highway 395 past Little Lake turn on Cinder road and follow the sign to Fossil Falls. Cinder road is about 1/2 way between Little Lake and Coso Junction. Drive 1 mile to the parking area. From the parking area walk 2/10 of a mile to the Falls. Just before you reach the falls look for a large boulder on your left with a large orange square painted on it. Go behind this boulder to the southeast side and find the highest part of the boulder. Look down ,the letterbox is under some movable rocks near your feet. This is nearly a driveby letterbox.The hike is 2/10 of a mile, the drive in is 1 mile, and there is a porta potty in the parking lot. I believe it's accessible 24 hrs, a with a flashlight you could nab the box but not really see the falls. There are picnic tables in the parking area and a nearby campground. The usual warnings apply particularly Rattlesnakes and scorpions. There's lotta lava but notta lotta watta. <br/>
