I am so excited to go to Pettasquamscutt Rock again.  It was my first <br/>
official try at finding a letterbox and I thought I just didn't know how to <br/>
use a compass or follow clues.  Can't wait to go up there and score.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

This letterbox appears to be my bain.  Friday morning about 10 AM I <br/>
hauled myself up to the top of Pettasquamscutt Rock.  Alas, no <br/>
letterbox under the glacial erratic.  I did get a beautiful view (and <br/>
a bunch of scratches from the briars surrounding what I thought was <br/>
the rock).  Did I miss it again??  I'm hoping that maybe my arrival <br/>
preceded the box's.  Thanks for a great view.<br/>

you have a baby in a backpack!!!  The older boys retrieved it.  I'm sorry to <br/>
hear they had been vandalized.  Maybe we'll go back to them this year on <br/>
vacation.  But there's so many others in the area!  Last time we went on a 6 <br/>
day vacation to RI and found 7 letterboxes.  There were two we couldn't <br/>
find.  Loved Afternoon on the Amazon, too.  That and Gift to Emily were our <br/>
last before we went home.  Thanks for replacing them!<br/>

Replacement stamps have been carved for two months but it took us forever to <br/>
go<br/>
back and plant new boxes for two of our earliest sites.  Viking Ships at<br/>
Sunrise and Afternoon on the Amazon are finally back in place.  We decided <br/>
to<br/>
use the same hiding spots as before.  If these don't make it then we will <br/>

Hi Laurette!<br/>
<br/>
I actually placed it Thurs pm in the rain on my way home from work.  <br/>
I can't believe that it has gone missing already.  I will send you <br/>
specific info off line to make sure that you were looking in the <br/>
correct place.  Let me know.<br/>
<br/>
