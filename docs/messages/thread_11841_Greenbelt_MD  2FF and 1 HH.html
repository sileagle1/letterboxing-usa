the afternoon sun to head to Greenbelt MD.<br/>
We found all 3 of the Beverage Animals around the lake and were the <br/>
first to find Milk Duck and Tea Tortl. <br/>
In Coffee Fish, the CoffeeBreak HH was picked up. My first officially <br/>
found HH. I think CoffeeBreak will be traveling to VA and DC with me. <br/>
Maybe at the Postal Museum on Saturday, you can say hi and stamp in! <br/>
<br/>
Very nice to be able to walk around without the plastic bag over a <br/>
cast on my foot and add 4 stamps to my log. I finally have gotten <br/>
over 25 finds. I know that is nothing compared to those New <br/>
Englanders, but for Northern VA, it is a good start.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to exchange with folks on Saturday! <br/>
