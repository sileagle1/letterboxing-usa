                    <div class="plaintext-content">A couple of weeks ago there were several postings about burlap, camouflage, etc. Someone mentioned Walmart sold camo in their sporting goods dept. We bought 1 large piece, no idea of size, for $8.50. We covered our most recent plants, the Grateful Dead "What a Long Strange Trip It's Been" series with it and easily have enough for 6-8 more boxes. This stuff works great! We realized on our way home from planting last weekend that we forgot to label the darn boxes (D'oh!) and went back today with labels and I was freakin' out because when I looked in the tree for our Dancing Bear box I was looking right at it and didn't see it and thought it was gone! Our other two boxes are totally invisible almost standing right on top of them. Just a small amount of leaves, dirt, sticks or whatever in your hidey hole and your box is almost invisible. Thanks for info! <br/>
