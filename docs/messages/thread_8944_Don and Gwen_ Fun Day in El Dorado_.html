We also tracked down your CSULB boxes a couple of weeks ago, and really <br/>
like your stamps.  We're getting ready to plant our first boxes, and wanted <br/>
to find out what carving materials and tools you are using.  Since the <br/>

<div>Marc/Jen &amp; Emma ,Welcome!!!!! FYI you have 
missed 3 in El Dorado not just 2. We checked all of the boxes last week except 
Elvis,due to a nearby fisherman . We have added a third LB State box also.For 
carving tips the best advice is to peruse the LBNA site under " Getting Started" 
and "What's New". Mirkwood has a lot of carving tips/help and go through the 
FAQS  on the last entry you will find a supplies link. I've used PZ KUT for 
most of our stamps,and usually carve with a speedball # 1&amp; # 3 &amp; # 
5 .Start with a simple type like the " 
Bat<span id="__#Ath#SignaturePos__"></span> " 
or the "Lady bug" or you can pick up store bought stamps at Michaels as well as 
the speedball tools. I've bought  carving block material at Michaels also. 
The "pink" stuff can be great unless it has been sitting on their shelves to 
long and when it's old it can be difficult to carve . One thing you should 
remember is that most  letterboxers would rather find a hand carved stamp 
than a store bought one, regardless of the artistic ability, but they would 
rather find a store bought one than no stamp at all. Looking forward to your 
boxes. Don</div>
