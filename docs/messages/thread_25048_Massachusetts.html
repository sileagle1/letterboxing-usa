The Boston Museum of Fine Arts is one of the finest showcases for art in the world, known for its innovativeness and exciting exhibits. It just so happened that Rachel Whiteread's "Village" was opening on Wednesday. New York, Vienna, London, Edinburgh, Sydney, and Munich are a few of the locations where Whiteread's works can be found. "Village" is a collection of over 200 old dollhouses arranged to look like a village at night. I know, that does not sound like much of an exhibit, but believe me it was. All of these dollhouses were old, made by fathers, enjoyed by daughters. They were also empty of furnishings, displayed as they were found, old and used up. The only addition was electric lights.  "Village" was haunting and memorable. Just one more proof that I am a sensitive man.<br/>

Although it was Ralph Waldo Emerson who owned land at Walden Pond it was Henry David Thoreau, who made the spot famous. Thoreau was a rebel, actively involved in political issues of his time. It was his reflection on nature and life that brought the importance of conservation to America's attention. Walden Pond Trail is a short, 3-mile, hike looping around the pond. I imagine on a summer day it can be over crowded. However I was here in the fall and there was only a handful of hikers about. <br/>

Rockport is at the tip of the Cape Ann Peninsula, a nice enough location for a town. Personally, I would not live there, as liquor stores are illegal. Elis F. Stenman lived there, even built a house. What makes his house so different is that it is built of newspapers, along with the furniture and the curtains. I thought it was quite unique, apparently so did ArchimedesScrew. Word on the street has it that she is trying to strong-arm a purchase of the place for the location of the Pinecone Museum of Splendid Stamped Creations. Does Mark Pepe know about this? <br/>

Salem is the place to be for Halloween. I arrived the last week of the "Haunted Happenings." Staying at the Hawthorne Hotel was itself a treat. The Dumb Supper, the Carn-Evil Creep Show Costume Ball, The Official Salem Witches' Halloween Ball, The Mourning Tea, and a sance were all held at the hotel. While in Salem, I also checked out the Salem Witch Museum. More than just a museum, the exhibits strive to show that all witch-hunts are a form of stereotyping and prejudice. But, I did not come here to talk about dollhouses, rebels, paper or sances; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>

Another big number state, Massachusetts has over 1,000 letterboxes, about 119 of which are mysteries. Planters, you are doing a good job covering. Finders, make sure you keep it that way. Good to see that most of the boxes have hand carved stamps. Summer storms bring lightning. Pay attention to the weather and keep away from exposed peaks during storms. In the spring and fall, you might find ice on the trails. Proper footwear can prevent a serious fall. Don't rely on a cell phone to help you in case of accidents or danger; most hiking trails will not have service. Prevention and a basic knowledge of first aid will do more to help you than a cell phone. <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
