and I just returned from a trip there and were able to find a few <br/>
letterboxes in Conwy.  As for easy to find boxes, I would <br/>
suggest "Eastern Slopes Inn" (about a ten minute walk) and "Diana's <br/>
Baths" (which is a mile round trip).  We also really enjoyed the <br/>
three box series at Cathedral Ledge (not to mention the view from <br/>
the top).  This one takes a little longer but is kid friendly.  Hope <br/>
you enjoy your trip!<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails,<br/>
