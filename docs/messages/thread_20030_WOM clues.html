                    <div class="plaintext-content">First, let me say to all who read this list, Mark and Sue are two of <br/>
the nicest and most enthusiastic letterboxers I have ever had the <br/>
pleasure of meeting. Their website is one of my fave boxing sites. <br/>
Their contributions to letterboxing have been nothing but positive. <br/>
Thanks for all you have done. <br/>
<br/>
The onion metaphor is right on.  <br/>
<br/>
I happen to be familiar with an area where there are very few <br/>
letterboxes and letterboxers though I live in boxious CT. I'll pass <br/>
along my experience with giving and getting WOM clues that concerns <br/>
some boxes in that area. <br/>
<br/>
If any boxer wishes to play the game this way in an area similar to <br/>
the type of place I mentioned above, the effort starts with YOU. YOU <br/>
must plant the boxes and reach out to people who might want to find <br/>
your boxes. Regional talk lists are perfect for this endeavor. You <br/>
can post that you have planted a box or a series whose clues are not <br/>
on the LbNA site and invite people to respond. You can email people <br/>
in your state off list and spread the word that you have WOM boxes. <br/>
You can place clues or a link to WOM boxes in another box. It does <br/>
take time and imagination. You must be patient. The fewer the boxes <br/>
and boxers there are in your area/state, the longer it takes. <br/>
<br/>
I planted a series of WOM boxes that were snail mail only. I got many <br/>
requests from locals and from passers-through for the clues. I kept <br/>
all the snail mail addresses and am getting ready to plant another <br/>
series and will send the new clues to everyone I sent the first set <br/>
to. This takes time and patience. In return, I have gotten some juicy <br/>
hard-to-come-by WOM clues. <br/>
<br/>
WOM clues open up countless places for boxes that publicly posted <br/>
clues can not as Ryan stated earlier. You may have less finders but I <br/>
can tell you the victories for both finder and placer are sweeter. If <br/>
you snail mail your clues, the opportunities for artfulness, if you <br/>
are so inclined, are endless. I have opened my mailbox and have found <br/>
hand bound books with WOM clues. What letterboxer would not love that <br/>
surprise? Minimally, well concealed boxes with well written WOM clues <br/>
are likely safer. There are urban WOM boxes out there that have <br/>
survived far longer than if they had been published on the LbNA site.<br/>
<br/>
Some may argue that they are deprived of some letterboxes if they <br/>
can't go to the LbNA site and print off the clues. As Mark said, <br/>
there are indeed layers of the onion that are not for everyone. <br/>
Seeking out WOM clues takes time and effort to be sure. For as many <br/>
boxers as there are, there are also varying degrees of effort and <br/>
skill involved. There are beautifully made artistic gems or clever <br/>
mystery box clues or straightforward clues that are published and <br/>
some that are not. <br/>
<br/>
There is no reason why new boxers cannot play the game this way if <br/>
they choose to do so. Take a chance, be creative and do it your way. <br/>
As Mark said, "we encourage and support you all." And like Mark, I <br/>
will also offer to help anyone anytime with your questions and <br/>
concerns. Just email me off list.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that there is something here for everyone and that <br/>
is what makes letterboxing so interesting. Kinda like the peeling the <br/>
layers of an onion. <br/>
<br/>
Mark, do boxers from the south have to peel sweet Vidalia's and <br/>
likewise, Texans, those monster 1015's?  Are scallions and shallots <br/>
an acceptable substitute for those gourmet type boxers? ;o)<br/>

&gt; We all appreciate new boxers. After all, new boxers perpetuate the <br/>
work<br/>

Oh Yipee, new letters! So let's see:<br/>
<br/>
F= plain old boring find (usually of a 1, 2 or 3 on the PI scale)<br/>
HH= hitchhiker<br/>
V= virtual...although if you don't get out from behind that computer<br/>
you'll wish your fat ass were virtual<br/>
PLB= postal letter box for the Particularly Lazy Boxer<br/>
N= Naked boxing (that tramp Ivy is up to N2)<br/>
FF= first finder<br/>
S= encountered snakes<br/>
PH= Purple Heart for getting injured while boxing<br/>
Ps=parasite which never caught on, hello, it's still a hitchhiker<br/>
SBAF= shoulda been a find (my first box was a sbaf, even had to sort<br/>
out incorrect the directions and it was STILL missing)<br/>
CBAF= coulda been a find but I got distracted on the way and found<br/>
something better to do<br/>
WBAF= woulda been a find but those damn picnickers were sitting right<br/>
next to the box ALL DAY!<br/>
X= exchange, if showing up at a party and getting 52 stamps in one<br/>
hour without getting up from the picnic table counts then my SBAF counts!<br/>
U= underwater box<br/>
T= toasted/tipsy and STILL found the box even with those lousy<br/>
directions (drunk letterboxing, try it at your next gathering...)<br/>
H= found it while in heels and you still made me walk four miles only<br/>
to end up at the parking lot, your getting a bill from my chiropodist!<br/>
M=mystery box<br/>
VM= virtually a mystery box cause the clues were so bad<br/>
DL= dead lemur box<br/>
WWJD= got a sermon from the religious clues I had to put up with while<br/>
hunting for this box.<br/>
<br/>
And now we can add WOM, at this rate I can parse out all my F's! Have<br/>
I missed any Psychomommy?<br/>

&gt; &gt; WOM's should count as any other P. That's how we do it and have seen<br/>

&gt; SBAF= shoulda been a find (my first box was a sbaf, even had to sort<br/>

&gt; CBAF= coulda been a find but I got distracted on the way and found<br/>
&gt; something better to do<br/>
&gt; WBAF= woulda been a find but those damn picnickers were sitting right<br/>
&gt; next to the box ALL DAY!<br/>
&gt; X= exchange, if showing up at a party and getting 52 stamps in one<br/>
&gt; hour without getting up from the picnic table counts then my SBAF<br/>

&gt; U= underwater box<br/>
&gt; T= toasted/tipsy and STILL found the box even with those lousy<br/>
