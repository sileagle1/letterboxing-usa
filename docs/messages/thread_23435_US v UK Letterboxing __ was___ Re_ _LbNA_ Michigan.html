&gt; Oh, you're not rubbing it in -- only displaying your ignorance. <br/>
Letterboxing in the US is not the same as it is in the UK.  The game<br/>
is not played the same, the perception is not the same.  If in the US,<br/>
we had the support of the National Parks as they do in the UK, then<br/>
perhaps it would be a different game.  But we don't and the more<br/>
widespread and public the hobby becomes, the more movement there has<br/>
been on the part of parks on other levels to follow the lead of the<br/>
National Parks.<br/>

Well, having only a meager 198 finds in 1.5 years and never having<br/>
been to Dartmoor, I suppose I'm a little ignorant of some matters. But<br/>
then, everyone is ignorant of something, aren't they? After all, I<br/>
went out looking for a letterbox today and couldn't find it. But<br/>
knowledge is key to eliminating blissful ignorance, and part of my job<br/>
is information research.<br/>
<br/>
So let's examine this further...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: Is Letterboxing the same in the US as it is in the UK? Is it played<br/>
the same?<br/>
<br/>
A1: For the most part, the concept of letterboxing didn't change when<br/>
it came to the US. Letterboxes are still hidden on public lands and in<br/>
scenic or remote places hikers want to share with other hikers...<br/>
mostly. And there is still the element of secrecy: that desire to be<br/>
lurking in the shadows, doing something nobody else knows you're<br/>
doing. It IS very much an underground activity in both places.<br/>
<br/>
A2: It does differ dramatically in the US in that we broadcast our<br/>
clues across the internet for anyone to see, whereas clues to boxes in<br/>
the UK are... more guarded. But that's our style, man! It's the<br/>
*American* way! Go overboard!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: What about the perception of the "game"?<br/>
<br/>
A: One reason the general perception is not the same in the US as it<br/>
is in the UK is because it's only 8 years old when compared to 152.<br/>
Yet.. even at 152 years old, there are many people in the UK who, when<br/>
asked about letterboxing, wonder why you're talking about their<br/>
mailbox. It's true! I've talked to them!<br/>
<br/>
Most people (read: n'oxers) I've mentioned it to seem interested in<br/>
the concept, but are too busy or too lazy or too non-adventurous to<br/>
follow up on it. Only one actually has, and I don't think it lasted<br/>
very long. It's not for everybody. If it was, we'd be in trouble.<br/>
Serious trouble.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: What about those pesky National Parks? Why can't we letterbox there?<br/>
<br/>
A: I can't tiptoe around this one: geocaching. Yes, it's true. Big<br/>
Brother was very, very watchful after President Clinton turned off the<br/>
Selective Availability scramblers that kept the civilian GPS units<br/>
from getting any more accurate than 100 meters. The explosive growth<br/>
of geocaching from 2000 to 2003 (from 0 to 150,000 participants, and<br/>
countless more caches!!) caused the National Parks to ban this type of<br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
Numerous reasons have been cited: danger to historical or<br/>
archaeological sites, danger to flora via trampling, danger to fauna<br/>
via creatures getting into these boxes, danger to humans who injure<br/>
themselves because they were watching their GPS units and not where<br/>
they were going and danger to humans who encounter bigger, more<br/>
dangerous fauna.<br/>
<br/>
Can't say I blame them. Especially on that last one.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing in the US, by comparison, was still a toddler when<br/>
geocaching was a teen with raging hormones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Q: So what do we do??<br/>
<br/>
A: If things had turned out the way those gents of 230 years had<br/>
originally intended, then we might not have had to answer the last<br/>
question or this one. Those National Parks are ours. The state parks<br/>
are ours. The city parks are ours. If we didn't pay for them through<br/>
taxes, they wouldn't exist. But we, the people, gave the government<br/>
control of itself, and now it makes all the silly rules that shouldn't<br/>
need to exist.<br/>
<br/>
So what we have to do is start from scratch, much like those guys 230<br/>
year had to do. We have to start small and work our way up the food<br/>
chain. We have to get the privately-owned parks onboard, and the city<br/>
parks, and the county parks, and the state parks...<br/>
<br/>
... and then we can stand up to the National Parks and say, "Look,<br/>
dang it! We CAN do this responsibly, without damaging anything,<br/>
leaving behind only footprints and stamp impressions! We have PROOF!<br/>
We want to Letterbox in OUR parks!"<br/>
<br/>
...<br/>
<br/>
Grandiose? Far-fetched? Maybe. But then, George and Thomas and Andrew<br/>
and Benjamin and all those guys certainly heard that numerous times!<br/>
<br/>
Will it take a long time? Definitely.<br/>
<br/>
Is it WORTH doing? You tell me.<br/>
