CSCM and I hit three East Bay letterboxes this past weekend.<br/>
<br/>
The Bristol Ferry Lighthouse LB in Portsmouth, RI, is in place, dry, and <br/>
intact, despite a position very close to the tidal wrack line and visits from <br/>
a local extortionist: "Leave me money as this is my only entertainment," s/he <br/>
says.<br/>
<br/>
We were able to locate The Pig Is Back LB inside the maize at Escobar's <br/>
Highland Farm, also in Portsmouth, even though someone had moved it to the <br/>
wrong bridge!  By the time this is posted, maize owners should have returned <br/>
it to its correct location.<br/>
<br/>
The Sachuest Point LB in Middletown, RI, is also in place, dry, and intact.  <br/>
We were going to do this one last year, but didn't think we had the time as <br/>
we were on our way to one of Newport's many festivals.  If only we had known <br/>
how easy it would be!<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, the Blue Hills Birthday LB, in Milton, MA, was found safe and <br/>
sound.  This was a nice and short (though strenuous!) hike for fitting it in <br/>
between appointments. Too bad we had missed the 'Coo Coo' crew that were <br/>
there before us that day. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we will continue to have such lovely weather for fall 'boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers to all.<br/>

Hmm, well that is a new one since my last visit out there.  I will<br/>
probably head head out to check on it this weekend again, anyway. <br/>
Thanks for the update ;o)<br/>
