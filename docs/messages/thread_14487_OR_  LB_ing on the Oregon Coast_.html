<br/>
Originally, John and I were going to head for Central Oregon to<br/>
celebrate our 6th anniversary of being together.  However, at the last<br/>
minute (like when John saw the weather report and saw it was like 102<br/>
degrees in John Day) we decided to turn tail and head West to Lincoln<br/>
City and Newport, instead!  What an excellent anniversary weekend spent<br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
The first thing we did was check on the Devil's Lake State Park box that<br/>
I placed way back in 2000.  True to reports, the orignal logbook was<br/>
completely waterlogged.  The letterbox is still there, though, contrary<br/>
to a couple reports that said otherwise.   Thanks to everyone who<br/>
e-mailed me about this and special thanks to Wild Woman for replacing<br/>
the logbook!!!  I adore you!!!  It's still right where I left it years<br/>
ago when I first started this sport.  I may change the clues a little<br/>
bit because some folks have had trouble finding it and I LOVE people to<br/>
find my boxes.  I don't do that mystery, mapsurfing-type stuff if I can<br/>
help it.  I like my boxes to be easy, family-friendly no-brainers.<br/>
<br/>
Next we headed down to where the "I Love Lincoln City" letterbox was<br/>
placed by Lennens 3.  I'm certain this letterbox is still there, but on<br/>
a Saturday morning, and then again on Sunday afternoon when the sun is<br/>
shining and no wind is blowing and so close to Mo's, and folks are at<br/>
every nearby picnic table as well as those milling around on their way<br/>
to the beach...Discretion?  FORGET ABOUT IT!  I have already told its<br/>
placer, my good buddy, Carie, that I will retrieve this box on another<br/>
day...like at 5:00 am, midweek, on a cold, nasty, rainy day when folks<br/>
aren't everywhere and suspicious of our every move.  <br/>
<br/>
We did manage to nab the very beautiful Boiler Bay Letterbox, placed by<br/>
Lennens 3 later in the day I'm happy to say!!!  To me this was a must<br/>
have box once I saw the carved image at the Milo McIver Gathering.  I<br/>
was obsessed to get this letterbox and it's a lovely find.<br/>
<br/>
Next it was the exasperating effort of Beneath the Blue #2 at Beverly<br/>
Beach State Park.  ARGH!!!  Here we go again!  We went Saturday, but<br/>
came up empty-handed.  Still, we weren't going to give up that easy.<br/>
Sunday we returned and were actually successful.  Surprise, surprise<br/>
(with very difficult boxes that are still there, John and I have noticed<br/>
that third time's a charm for us)!  It was a major accomplishment since<br/>
the only others who have managed to stamp in are Ryan and Wild Woman and<br/>
THEY BE VERY SMART PEOPLE!!!!  I think we just be very lucky people.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday night we stayed in Newport where I was inspired to carve a<br/>
brand-new stamp for a location that desperately needs a letterbox.<br/>
Devil's Punch Bowl at Otter Rock.  Thanks to Carie for the idea for a<br/>
great hiding place.  I've wanted to place one here for years, and if it<br/>
weren't for her creative genius, there'd still be no LB there.  We<br/>
placed it on Sunday morning.  <br/>
I have not had so much fun carving a stamp for a letterbox in years!  I<br/>
was laughing the whole time I carved it.  The last time I recall having<br/>
this much fun carving a letterbox stamp off the cuff was for Colliding<br/>
Rivers in Douglas County. I am big-headed about this stamp and I will<br/>
love those who seek it out.  I think people will be amused and laugh<br/>
when they see the image.  <br/>
<br/>
Saturday afternoon we planted a new one at Yaquina Bay Lighthouse State<br/>
Park.  Yes, the image is on this of the historic lighthouse which was<br/>
only in service for a very short time.  And the term "Lighthouse" is<br/>
literal.  This is literally a house with a light on the top.  No joke.  <br/>
<br/>
Saturday evening after carving my silly little Devil's Punch Bowl stamp<br/>
we headed out to the Mike Miller Education Trail to try for the Sitka<br/>
Spruce Letterbox.  It is listed as placed by Doc Science and Ginger, but<br/>
abandoned.  We did not find it.  We searched and searched diligiently<br/>
with the help of many hungry mosquitoes.  Still, with all that<br/>
assistance, we came away stampless.  Has anyone ever gotten this<br/>
letterbox???  It's a nice location, and the clues seemed quite<br/>
straightforward, yet to no avail.  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday afternoon, we went to Toledo for the Waterleaf letterbox placed<br/>
recently by Jeep Jeep.  Eventually, we did find this one.  Interesting<br/>
hiding place, though bound to be soaked come winter, I imagine.<br/>
Interesting commercial stamp.  This is a park definitely worth checking<br/>
out.  We felt very happy and honored to be the first to stamp in.<br/>
Thanks so much Jeep Jeep for placing!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, what...We found three and placed two and I had more fun at the beach<br/>
than I can possibly remember.  Not only that, but we actually hiked down<br/>
and meandered in the actual cauldron of the Devil's Punch Bowl!!!!<br/>
That's the first time in my life I'd ever been there at a time when<br/>
there was no water within (very low summer tide - timing just right!)<br/>
and I've been there a lot in my lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for a wonderful weekend!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
