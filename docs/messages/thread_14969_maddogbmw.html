We don't hate you, we haven't received any mail from you. Gwen &amp; I have been on the road. It's been dang HOT in Kernville ,so we switched to the digest while we are in Seal Beach. We are on a lap top and it just seemed easier than reading all of the list. Sometimes we miss posts due to cruising through them to quickly.BTW did you hear our story about your BMW box? If not I can relate it to you off post or I can list it on post. Don<br/>
