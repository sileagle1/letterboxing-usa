                    <div class="plaintext-content">I headed over to Jerusalem after work yesterday, dog in tow, to check out<br/>
the barnacles on the other side of town.  It had been a stressful day, and I<br/>
was hoping a little boxing would help me decompress.  It did.  It was<br/>
wonderful.  The late afternoon sun was hitting at just the perfect angle,<br/>
and across the way the hard-bitten port of Galilee was looking postcard<br/>
perfect.  For the first time in a long time I was able to look at those<br/>
docks without thinking about the hard work and endless worries going on over<br/>
there, and simply enjoy the beauty of the place.  On the other side of the<br/>
peninsula a great egret was strutting it's stuff in the shallow waters, and<br/>
just as I was wondering if any osprey had made use of the nest in the clues,<br/>
one landed on the ground less than 30 feet away.  It spread it's wings and<br/>
bobbed its' head at us, letting me know just who this little patch of<br/>
unspoiled land really belonged to.  I've never been this close to an osprey.<br/>
It was magnificent.<br/>
<br/>
The box was well hidden, but easy to find.  Given my recent work history, I<br/>
got a real chuckle out of the stamp.  I wasn't the first to find this box,<br/>
but I was the first to stamp in.  Pete and Wanda must have been in such a<br/>
hurry to get there first that they rushed out without theirs.  ;&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Bosco found the whole experience to be an exercise in frustration.<br/>
Bunnies, bunnies everywhere, and a danged human-on-a-string holding him<br/>
back.  Rats!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Laurette, for this chance to get away from it all right in my own<br/>
backyard.<br/>
