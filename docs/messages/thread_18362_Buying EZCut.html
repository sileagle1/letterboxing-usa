I'm a new letterboxer, having just planted my first two boxes at <br/>
Turkey Run State Park in IN.  (my favorite place in the ENTIRE <br/>
world!)  If anyone finds them, please drop me a note and let me know <br/>
how I did.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
My question today is about buying EZCut.  I've been doing <br/>
websearches, looking for the best (read, cheapest!) place to buy and <br/>
have it shipped.  I'm a long way from good craft stores in central SC <br/>
and I find myself suddenly addicted to carving.  My first two were <br/>
very simple but I'll keep working at it!<br/>
<br/>
Good sources would be appreciated.<br/>

I'm sure someone will give you the web address for ordering PZCut,  <br/>
I don't have it handy at the moment.  I ordered the B grade to save <br/>
a bit &amp; found it quite satisfactory.<br/>

You got off to a great start if you hid them at Turkey Run!  Hiding <br/>
a box in a great location is one of the things that can make or <br/>
break a box, and few places rank up there with Turkey Run.  I'm not <br/>
sure I'd say it's my *favorite* place in the entire world, but it <br/>
certainly ranks in the top ten!  =)  Probably the best generally <br/>
unknown place in the world, though!<br/>

<br/>
I've had good luck ordering things from Dick Blick online. I just <br/>
checked their site and they've got the following for EZCut blocks: <br/>
Box of 2, 4"x6", $3.59; Box of 2, 9"x12", $14.29.<br/>
<br/>
They're at http://www.dickblick.com/. Do a search on "e-z-cut" and <br/>
you should find the blocks.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

Shhhhhhh, we should be VEWWWWY VEWWWWY QUIET then.....   <winking><br/>
<br/>
Turkey Run is a very very special place to me.  I'm glad someone else <br/>
on the list recognizes it too.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Someone go find my first box so I can find out if I did alright!!!  <br/>
Now that I'm carving better I'll replace (or maybe just add!?) a <br/>
better stamp to the box next I go through.<br/>
