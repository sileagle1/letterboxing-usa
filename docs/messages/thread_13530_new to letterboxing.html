welcome!!!!!!.....i dont have but one letterbox in my immediate town....so i find them as i go to different towns....<br/>
<br/>
be sure to check out the main letterbox page..... http://letterboxing.wesgarrison.us .....notice there is not www in the url....<br/>
<br/>
if you have any reststops near your home...check them out to see if they are good for hiding....plant one there....<br/>
<br/>
you hide letter boxes well....away from high traffic areas if possible and out of view from eyes if you are not the "hunters" of boxes....dont bury them in dirt tho....usually pushed way under full bushs....cover with rocks....leaves...branches...etc...<br/>
<br/>
never stick your hands in holes...crevices...hollow logs...in bushes etc....if there is something in these use a long stick (i use a broom handle) to poke around these areas to hopefully be able to sccoot it out or drag it out into view with the stick....rehide where found...hide well from view....<br/>
<br/>
enjoy your hunts...you can see some really interesting places ...some you may have never known where there....or you had never been to before..<br/>

Hi,<br/>
I am new to letterboxing, I found out through my sister in law. She <br/>
has been doing it for a while and when she told me I knew I would be <br/>
hooked, so I carved my stamp and have already found 3 letterboxes, <br/>
look foward to finding many more. I want to thank you all for the <br/>
great information posted on this group, it has been very helpful and <br/>
all my questions have been answered.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone! I just wanted to say thank you for the adventure! I was <br/>
sitting on my couch last night reading the latest issue of Family Fun <br/>
and I ran across a several page article about letterboxing. I had never <br/>
heard of it, so I got on-line and I was very surprised to find that <br/>
there were boxes in our hometown! I was talking to my husband about <br/>
forwarding the information to our local Girl Scout council office. You <br/>
see, I am a Girl Scout Leader in St. Joseph, MO, but my troop is going <br/>
into junior high this year and they decided to take a break from troop <br/>
activities. My own children, ages 6, 9 and 12, overheard the <br/>
conversation and talked me into doing this as a new "Mom &amp; Me" weekend <br/>
activity. We went on our first adventure today and ended up locating 4 <br/>
boxes! We all had a terrific time and now the kids want to know how <br/>
soon we can go again! This is such a great activity for families, <br/>
especially those who can't afford the expensive amusement parks and <br/>
such. We'll be going again soon, that's for sure!<br/>

just wanted to say hello. My kids and I met you early this Spring while <br/>
searching for some of your letterboxes. You were very kind to them and <br/>
you stamped my book (does that count as an exchange? You didn't have <br/>
your book, so I couldn't stamp it). Anyway, this has turned into a <br/>
great hobby for us and I'm about to plant our second box. If all the <br/>
other boxers are like you, I hope we get to meet as many of them as <br/>
possible. <br/>

Haven't boxed much recently.  Just too hot this summer and too wet early .  I hope <br/>
we can get to box this week end.  There are some new ones Out East and  one in <br/>
Nassau in a very nice preserve.  We will see what  the wekend brings.<br/>
