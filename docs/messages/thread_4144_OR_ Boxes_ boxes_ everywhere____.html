<br/>
*hehe*  It's a corny phrase, I know, but "think outside the box" <br/>
applies very well in this case.  Beyond that, you don't get anything <br/>
beyond the clues already posted.  =)<br/>
<br/>
However, I will tell you the part of the clue that finally got me <br/>
looking in the right place, because I missed it the first time I went <br/>
out there.<br/>
<br/>
Compare the terrain difficulty for the Horsetail Falls box and the <br/>
Multnomah Falls box.  The Horsetail box isn't hard to find (lots of <br/>
people have), and it'll give you a point of reference in terms of <br/>
difficulty of the hike to expect for the Multnomah Falls box.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally found that darned Little People box.  Still haven't found any <br/>
little people around, though....<br/>
<br/>
Funhog and I also hunted down the insidious Willamette <br/>
Univerity letterbox to the amusement of the clue's creator.  It's a <br/>
wonderful, little box, though, and if you're in the Salem area, it's <br/>
definitely worth the effort!  I think it was actually more funny <br/>
running into people that *didn't* know the answers to the clues, <br/>
but would offer other suggestions for how to avoid things like <br/>
marriage.  What a hoot!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Then there's the Movie Mystery box, which is a delightful clue now <br/>
that I finally got my hands on a computer that could play it!  =)  <br/>
Went in, nabbed the box, and found Ginger hopping a ride as <br/>
well.  Beautiful stamps, too!  <br/>
<br/>
But it looks like my letterboxing days are over--at least until the <br/>
Great Letterboxing Extravaganza.  I've got other things that need <br/>
doing first.  *sigh*  <br/>
