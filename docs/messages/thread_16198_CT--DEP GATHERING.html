of the field day. The weather kind of put a damper on the events, but you <br/>
can't plan for everything. However it couldn't dampen our spirits or stay us from <br/>
our courses though. We all set out to get as many finds &amp; exchanges as we <br/>
possibly could. Excellent stamps to everyone, especially to Musicwoman and <br/>
Sunshine--kudos!  Still a few loose ends though,wasn't able to buy a shirt from Kstar <br/>
this time around,(does she make a black XL or XXL?) and i will have to return <br/>
another time to do the samhain triliogy--i hate rain!  Lastly,i have to give <br/>
a resounding THANKS to all the die-harders who showed up and made the <br/>
gathering that much better for a newbie, do i have to name names? OK, here <br/>
goes--THANKS TO--musicwoman,pinetree,phynstar,butterfly,sunshine,swampyankee,toad <br/>
dog(thanks for the hitchhiker!),Kstar,aili,bruce,cleo,the end gang,sadie and russ &amp; <br/>
the handy hitchers.WHEW! To all those i missed, i'm sorry, but you know who you <br/>
are ! Well, i have to go rest now, i need to build up my energy for the next <br/>
boxing day. Looking forward to seeing you all again on the trail !(or at the <br/>
next gathering)         Northstar &amp; Moonbeam<br/>
