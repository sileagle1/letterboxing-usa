<br/>
  I don't like just sneaking in without saying I'm here and saying hello - so...I'm here..hello!!<br/>
<br/>
  I actually read of LbNA through my ISP - as someone here pointed out - Earthlink has a small blurb about Letterboxing in a newsleter - "Hmmmmm" I thought as I clicked the link to learn more - "This looks interesting"<br/>
<br/>
  And indeed I DO find it very interesting, and here I am to learn more and meet some folks. I've already scoped out the Lb's around my area here in the big state of Texas.<br/>
<br/>
  I don't know how y'all feel about Earthlink's blurb - is it a good thing to Letterboxing to have an influx of new interested folks like myself?  I'd think it would be a positive thing to the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
  I think what appeals to me is that here lately we've had some super nice weather, and my youngsters and I spend WAY too much time indoors - they're glued to the GameCube way too much and I'm not much better - always playing with the square-headed girlfriend (Computer).<br/>
<br/>
  So anyway here I am and I'll go back to lurking and learning mode.  Nice to meet you all!<br/>

&gt; Welcome Eric, every day a new thread here has some tidbit you will <br/>
enjoy and lots to laugh about. Letterboxers are a great group of <br/>
people with a very diverse base so it makes for such an interesting <br/>
variety of info shared.  Your kids will love the adventure , mystery <br/>
and reward of finding these letterboxes. I wish them good luck on <br/>
their first adventure. Have them share the idea with a friend and <br/>
hide a couple for friends to find, all of a sudden there will be  <br/>
more fun boxes in your area! Get away from gamecube and read and <br/>
follow directions while exercising you can't find a better family <br/>
activity. Good luck ,  Leader of the Pack in Ct. <br/>

   :-)  How about "Let me know how that works out for ya"  :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;here are some elements that scare away most people:<br/>
&gt;1) Probably the biggest is that a personal stamp is usually &gt;custom made.  The idea of carving a custom stamp is enough to &gt;make most people quit right there. (Not that it is a rule that &gt;you MUST have a custom stamp...)<br/>
<br/>
   Bah - I look forward to making my own stamp!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;2) Having to decipher clues that may be obscure "takes too much &gt;time. Just tell me where it's at."  We are a society that is &gt;used to having things done for us instantly.  This may explain &gt;why there are so many more geocaches than letterboxes.  The GPS &gt;does most of the finding work for us.  Just follow the arrow to &gt;the box.<br/>
<br/>
  I can see where both hobbies would be fun.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Like any other hobby, not getting new blood will eventually &gt;lead to the death of it.<br/>
<br/>
   You bet - great hearing your views Eric I appreciate it sir.<br/>
