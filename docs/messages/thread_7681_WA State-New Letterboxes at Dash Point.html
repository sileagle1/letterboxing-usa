                    <html><body><div>Dash Point Letterboxes<br/>Dash Point State Park<br/>State Route 509<br/>Federal Way<br/>King County<br/>Washington<br/><br/>Level of difficulty: Mostly level, dirt, gravel or beach trails. Clues easy to moderate. <br/><br/>Play at the beach or hike in the woods!  I would choose both if I were you.....</div> <div> </div> <div>Directions: Dash Point State Park can be approached from the north or the south on SR 509.  The entrance to the day use area of the park is just north of the King/Pierce county line.  Park in the main lot at the bottom of the hill.<br/><br/>Dash Point "Beach" Letterbox:  <br/><br/>First of all, find the beach!  That's easy, right?  Next hang a right and walk roughly NE along the high side of the beach until you come to a log sticking out of the bushes.  The log is pointing due west.  Then take approximately 15 more paces and find a scant trail heading into the woods.  This will put you into a small clearing with kid's trails heading in various directions.  Take an immediate left and head under the low branches of an old maple tree for about 20 paces.  Take another left under another maple tree.   The trail all but disappears, but look right for an old moss covered log.  Your objective is in the lower end. <br/><br/>Dash Point "Camp Fire" Letterbox:<br/><br/>Back to the parking lot!  Find the trail at the SW corner of the parking lot.  (Dogs are OK but don't park here)  Pass under the steel supported conveyance system (SR 509) and pass a couple of very old stumps from the cross cut saw days.  Stay on the main trail across a bridge over a peaceful creek and past a sliding log on the right. From experience, DZDezi says to only attempt this ride with long, thick pants!  Stay on the main trail and across a bridge that is supported by overgrown Lincoln Logs.  Continue past this bridge and come to another bridge.  Cross this bridge and look for an autographed triple-stumped alder tree.  The box is at the base of the East trunk.   If you get to the cable railing, you have gone too far.  Please re-hide well!    <br/><br/><br/>Placed by Sun Seeker and DZDezi<br/><br/>(Webmaster:  Please include with DZDezi's Letterboxes and change the title to say DZDezi and Sun Seeker's Letterboxes)  <br/><br/></div></body></html>
