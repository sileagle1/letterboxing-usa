                    <div class="plaintext-content">Woo hoo! I'm jumping for joy today.  I randomly went out to check on <br/>
ANOTHER STAR because I thought construction workers had crunched it.  <br/>
I was so excited to find it there and brought it home.  I had no idea <br/>
that when I'd actually open it up later, that folks had actually <br/>
stamped into it-2 different sets of people!!  A miracle.  I'll <br/>
replace it today.<br/>
<br/>
I was starting to think I was the only one here.  Where are the other <br/>
Idaho letterboxes?  So fun.  Anyhow thanks for stamping in.  You made <br/>
my day.  I'll also have to update Small Town Mystery letterbox as <br/>
it's missing (stay tuned for version 2).  Thanks again for coming to <br/>
this box.  I'll have to check on the others now.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you thank you thank you!!!  =-)<br/>
