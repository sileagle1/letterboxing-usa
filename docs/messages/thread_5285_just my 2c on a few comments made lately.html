&gt;  I think that he has a point, as one could clearly see<br/>
&gt; a path worn to the letterbox, so some damage had<br/>
&gt; obviously occured to that part of 'the habitat'.  As I<br/>
&gt; find more boxes I'm wondering if we need to be more<br/>
&gt; aware of the habitat and perhaps place them closer to<br/>
&gt; the trail?<br/>
<br/>
Limit the impact by removing it after a set number of visitors<br/>
or days.  There are ways to limit the visitors, and/or limit the <br/>
time.  Don't allow any impact.  If you are unsure, ask a local<br/>
expert.  (As an aside, I believe the geocachers actually do this;<br/>
negative comments about them notwithstanding as addressed later).<br/>
The unit itself will eventually go away one way or the other, so<br/>
I have never considered that impact.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think the NPS policy about letterboxing and geocaching is based in<br/>
&gt; part on their objections to disturbing habitat/trampling new <br/>
&gt; trails/fears of "digging", etc. but also a blanket policy against <br/>
&gt; litter in the parks.<br/>
<br/>
The cited reason by NPS is a policy about leaving abandoned property<br/>
in parks.  They may be against off-trail activity, but the fact that<br/>
they tolerate confluence hunting indicates (at least to me) that<br/>
the physical object is the overriding factor.  (Some parks have local<br/>
regulations against off-trail activity, and they will cite you for<br/>
whatever activity you are doing off-trail; this is another kettle of fish<br/>
altogether.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But among other things, it suggests that they lump <br/>
&gt; letterboxers &amp; geocachers together in the same heap.<br/>
<br/>
As well they should.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If we letterboxers start getting linked to that sort of sub-idiotic <br/>
&gt; behavior [by a geocacher], our days are numbered.  Also, some state <br/>
&gt; parks &amp; other jurisdictions will likely take their cue from whatever <br/>
&gt; the NPS does, so it's a potential headache for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Geocachers need to begin a serious effort to police themselves, &amp; we <br/>
&gt; all need to keep a close eye on developments with the NPS.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (which they discovered while investigating those hole-digging geocachers, <br/>
&gt; it seems)<br/>
<br/>
First, lets kill the "us vs them" right now.  I am aware of letterboxers <br/>
who have ripped thru stone walls in CT looking for letterboxes with no<br/>
thought of replacing the stones to keep the wall in its original state, <br/>
or any thought of the history buffs who enjoy that those walls remain intact <br/>
(and yeah, it sounds weird, but archaeologists study them, and letterboxing <br/>
sounds weird to many as well, imagine that ...).<br/>
<br/>
The point being there are more geocachers and geocaches than lbers and<br/>
lbs, hence you here more stories about them.  There are bad apples in both <br/>
hobbies.<br/>
<br/>
So, I don't think the answer is distancing letterboxers from geocachers,<br/>
but realising they are in the same boat.  Land managers will see the two <br/>
in the same boat, anyway, IMO.  The fact of the matter is that there <br/>
are entities who have a financial interest in making sure geocaching <br/>
succeeds and goes mainstream, and IHMO they are farther along in "policing <br/>
themselves" than letterboxers may be.<br/>
<br/>
It might make sense to see what they may be doing right rather than assume<br/>
they are doing things wrong.  I haven't been involved much with geocaching<br/>
in the past six months or so, but when I was, I was aware that they were <br/>
doing more "policing" than letterboxers were.  Not to pass judgement one way<br/>
or another on the appropriateness of their policing; just to make the point<br/>
that IMO some of these comments are off-base in the grand scheme of things,<br/>
and some of the things they were doing addressed some of the points in this <br/>
thread.<br/>
<br/>
LBers may think land manager's rules are bogus, and it is the case that <br/>
clearcutting is legal in places where letterboxing isn't, and someone may <br/>
be about to chime in with the pointless arguments that 'its my tax dollars, <br/>
its my land, and i know what i'm doing', but IMO the only long term answer <br/>
is making these activities legitimate in the eyes of the land managers.  I <br/>
don't know how to do that, but I don't think bashing geocachers is the right <br/>
answer.  I vote for admitting that letterboxers do the same thing, and seeing <br/>
if that helps somehow ... since _almost_ everyone involved in these things <br/>
wants stratospheric growth, it may make sense to grow together.<br/>
<br/>
(sorry for the length -- of course, you didn't have to read it :-))<br/>
<br/>

...and it was good reading.  I agree with most of what you wrote.  We must<br/>
face facts that litterboxers and geotrashers alike will be lumped in with<br/>
the lowest common denominator... one is bad so we all must be bad.  Your<br/>
self-policing comments were also good.  Given the inherently covert nature<br/>
of letterboxing, do you have any suggestions for self-policing?  I believe<br/>
that we can attain the same status, in regards to our perception as viewed<br/>
by NPS, as the confluence bunch by setting a good example and demonstrating<br/>
our lack of impact on environment.  How can we impress this on our growing<br/>
population? <br/>

Well, all this discussion about the NPA and taking care where we hide and<br/>
how we find letterboxes has made me more aware of our impact on the woods,<br/>
particularly when we can't find a letterbox and start looking everywhere. I<br/>
went back and looked at our LBNA web site, and the FAQ does mention that we<br/>
need to be careful of the environment. It just hasn't been foremost in our<br/>
minds. (Don't get me wrong, we haven't been destructive, just a little<br/>
unaware.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the web masters could add a few more comments about being careful<br/>
to leave the site and its surroundings exactly how you found it in the<br/>
"Getting Started" section? Just my 1c.<br/>

<br/>
OK, hang on.  I said, "I'm sure most geocachers behave responsibly, <br/>
but a percentage of them don't."  That's hardly "us vs them".<br/>
If geocachers are self-policing, great, but I saw no evidence of it <br/>
in the incident I described.  By self-policing, I mean in large part, <br/>
peer pressure.  If some clown stashes a bottle of booze in his cache, <br/>
folks ought to come down on that guy like a ton of bricks, &amp; point <br/>
out to him that some kid could have found that.  That's the sort of <br/>
thing I'm talking about.<br/>
The NPS memo is disturbing, for a variety of reasons.  I believe at <br/>
some point, we might have to make some sort of organized effort to <br/>
educate them about our activities.  I get the impression that at the <br/>
local level, many Park Service staffers aren't all worked up about <br/>
letterboxing the way the memo suggests.  But like I said, it's <br/>
something to watch closely, so that a knee-jerk reaction doesn't <br/>
evolve into set policy.<br/>
Besides, if letterboxers &amp; government can peacfully coexist across <br/>
the pond, I would hope we could do the same here.<br/>
Anyway, Randy, I'm glad this stuff is being discussed, even if we may <br/>
disagree on a thing or 2.  Hope to meet you on the trail someday <br/>
under more pleasant circumstances!<br/>
