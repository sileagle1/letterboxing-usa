<div>Thoughs......</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After a little over a year of 
Letterboxing fun and the recent demise of three of my locally placed boxes, I 
have been rethinking my choice of hiding places. Not so much the place but the 
materials I use to cover my boxes. Both of the boxes recently gone missing were 
covered by bark, leaves and sticks. I am not so sure that is the best idea, 
especially if it is in a rotted log. Maybe it's ok up against a healthy tree 
with a natural impression or hiding place (but I will still try to add stones 
for security). From now on I am going to try very hard to cover my boxes with 
some kind of stones. The classis British cairn. In some cases this will 
mean I will have to carry some flat ones with me, ie. coastal VA has plenty 
of sand but lacks very many rocks.</div>

little more, I have found the same problem in some places in the <br/>
Pacific Northwest.  I don't think some of my boxes will last very <br/>
long because of the flimsiness of their covering.<br/>

One of my favorite boxes in VA. (actually DC--Cherry Blossoms) Was <br/>
hidden with "A flat rock brought for the purpose from a New England <br/>
stone wall"  I think that is a Drewclan box!<br/>

Some potential advice on hiding places, FWIW --<br/>
<br/>
Find an _absolutely ideal_ hiding place and work backwards.  A <br/>
good hiding place is the hardest part of placing a letterbox, IMO.<br/>
Its rare that a letterbox has to placed within 10, 20, or even 100<br/>
meters of some feature or goal of the clue.  I think the clue can <br/>
still be made to work in the features you wish to emphasize or the<br/>
people to visit, but the box be elsewhere, in its ideal hiding place.<br/>
Sometimes that's not possible (like on Steens Mountain, but its <br/>
something we try to do ...)<br/>
<br/>
Don't make cairns, especially out of bark and twigs.  This stuff<br/>
does not last.  Rock cairns are somewhat better, but not great and too <br/>
visible unless in a totally remote place.<br/>
<br/>
Still, look for natural crevices and cubbyholes.  I think the area<br/>
should look identical before and after placement.  I think the best<br/>
technique, in rocky terrain, is to find a rock half buried, pull it<br/>
out of the ground, where it will leave a cavity, hollow that cavity<br/>
out a bit more, put the box in, then put the rock back exactly as <br/>
it was.  The box stays pretty safe then.  The drawback with this <br/>
technique is that it encourages people to overturn rocks hunting <br/>
for it, so make the last part of the clue a no brainer, or use an <br/>
obvious rock.<br/>
<br/>
I've also imported large rocks for the purpose of hiding boxes in<br/>
rockless terrain, but I dislike the idea of taking rocks from<br/>
the stone walls.  I also dislike the idea of hiding boxes in the<br/>
stone walls, as this encourages people to recklessly tear thru the<br/>
walls looking for boxes.  To some, and I know this will sound odd<br/>
to many, those stone walls are treasures from the past and should <br/>
be preserved, not damaged by letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

<div>Randy,</div>
<div>     I am searching for that 
"perfect" spot to place my first letterbox and your ideas were very helpful. 
Thanks.</div>
