We visited the "Grinning Ninny" and the "Round Table" in Cheshire, CT this past weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately we found the Ninny's logbook soaking wet.  It would be really helpful if someone who lives in the area could take it home for a few days because it could be used again after a good drying.  This is a wild looking stamp that everyone should add to their collection.<br/>
<br/>
The Round Table was a bit tricky to find as the  compass reading was off 180 degrees.  When standing so as to see Black Dog's mountain, the boulder was west of the trail at 10 deg rather than at 190.  Also, the box was found under the boulder's eastern end.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday evening checked Pequot Woods in Mystic, CT and found "Aix sponsa" 1 and 2 and "Bridges of  Pequot Woods" all doing well in their usual homes.<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete in RI<br/>
Looking forward to more western CT hiking.<br/>
