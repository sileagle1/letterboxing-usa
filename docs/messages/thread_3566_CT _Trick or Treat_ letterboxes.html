With Halloween right around the corner, we just had to recommend a couple of seasonal favorites for those able to get out boxing this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Carolyn's "Puzzles Double Your Fun" (Mansfield Depot, CT) packs a mean pair of pumpkins and "Trail of Terror (Not)" (Branford, CT) features some of the coolest spooky trees we've ever seen!<br/>
<br/>
Just one word of caution, though:  we think the "T" of T-intersection in part three of "T of T" stands for "Trick or Treat", as there are no true T intersections on this particular part of the trail.  (A true "T" is where the path you are on ends and you have to take a right or left onto a new path.)  There are, however, two "false T's", both with requisite 80 degrees.  Needless to say we took first (and wrong) one and ended up along the pond looking at the wrong stones and trees, but then the Halloween boy himself magically appeared to set us back on the correct path! So do not despair, "Dem Bones" are really there!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes and have a happy Halloween,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
