<br/>
If you have not heard yet, I dropped the ball.  The people at <br/>
Tarrywile and EMS needed information on who was camping overnight at <br/>
Tarrywile for the Trail Day Gathering.  I was not able to get that <br/>
information out in a timely manner.  In fact, requests are still <br/>
coming in.  Therefore ... camping at Tarrywile will not be <br/>
available.  I am terribly sorry for the inconvenience that may cause <br/>
for some of you.  It is entirely my fault.<br/>
<br/>
The Trail Day Gathering is still going on and will be a fun time had <br/>
by all.  Please do attend!<br/>
<br/>
Thanx- Alan (Letterboxer2002)<br/>
