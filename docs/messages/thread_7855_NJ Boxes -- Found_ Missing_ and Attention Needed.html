great boxing experiences, as well as recruiting a new boxing devotee! <br/>
A few notes:<br/>
<br/>
"Swamp Thing" box in Estell Manor Park -- The little blue ink pad was <br/>
in pieces and soaked and slimy and leaking ink all over the baggie. I <br/>
took it out of the box and disposed of it, so it wouldn't leak all <br/>
over everything else in the box.  The stamp was wet and moldy.  I <br/>
cleaned it off as best I could with paper toweling and put it in a <br/>
dry plastic bag.  Also, the clues may need to be adjusted for this <br/>
one -- looks like there have been a few new sections of boardwalk put <br/>
in (and the trail rerouted) since the clues were written.  It made <br/>
the clues a bit confusing in a few places.  I actually had given up <br/>
looking and was on my way back when I found the box.<br/>
<br/>
"Delaware Bayshore: East Point" -- Enjoyed visiting this graceful old <br/>
lighthouse, but was not able to find the letterbox.  Again, not <br/>
difficult clues...  found the pole, the indicated direction and <br/>
number of steps took me to a place where it would be logical to place <br/>
a box, but an exhaustive search of the surrounding area (during which <br/>
I acquired at least 78 new mosquito bites), was fruitless.  Not sure <br/>
if it is missing or the mosquitos made me delirious.<br/>
<br/>
"Sandcrab" box on Long Beach Island -- See message #16423 of 9/16/02.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes found in good condition:<br/>
<br/>
Cape May Park &amp; Zoo -- Wonderful stamp!!<br/>
Cape May Lighthouse<br/>
Jersey Shore Tracks #1 &amp; #2<br/>
5 Bridges of Batsto<br/>
Batona Trail Surprise<br/>
Delaware Bayshore: Moore's Beach<br/>
Delaware Bayshore: Jake's Landing<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the enjoyable clues on all of these, some great hikes, <br/>
especially the two at Batsto -- highly recommend these.<br/>
<br/>
Also planted a few new boxes (4) in New Jersey -- clues to follow <br/>
later today or tomorrow.<br/>
