To Jay, Thanks for telling Amy and I about the stamp store in Essex, <br/>
it's wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
To Ruthann, Your sister says hello and that she's going to get back <br/>
to the talk list shortly, but as you know it's the busy season for <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
To everyone else,  We can't praise this shop high enough.  It had the <br/>
carving matterial we were looking for.  All kinds of premade stamps <br/>
and Miss Kathleen sponsers classes on various diffrent art forms.  If <br/>
anyone is in the Essex, Ct. area it is well worth the side trip <br/>
however long to visit.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks also to the Irish Tinker for the three new boxes in Coventry, <br/>
Amy really enjoyed the stories.  All boxes found in execlent <br/>
condition.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick and Amy<br/>

<p>I concur with Patrick &amp; Amy with regard to the Essex stamp shop. 
  Discovered it by accident a few weeks ago when walking through that lovely 
  village with friends. They had to just about drag me out of there so I didn't 
  have time to spend as much money as I wanted (but it's in the top three of my 
  "places to go back to in CT" list). If Miss Kathleen doesn't have it, you 
  don't need it! Like Essex itself, this shop is soooooooo worth the trip!

   Actually, yes it is right across the street from the Griswold <br/>
Inn.  We were discussing going there as we drove by it.  If you're <br/>
looking for an easy box, Zoom Zoom Zoom is right around the corner <br/>
(within 5 minutes).  Hope you enjoy it!  Let her know you are <br/>
lettboxers; she does some boxing also.<br/>
