left].  Great reading for new members and highly recommended for some<br/>
who may have forgotten their manners.  Open the "Moderation<br/>
policy.txt" by drewclan, look in the paragraph titled: "What's an<br/>
inappropriate posting?" stated right off will be: "In general, you can<br/>
write about letterboxing until your fingertips calcify..."<br/>
<br/>
The "one kitten just died" post is a form of harassment, a way of<br/>
stirring up trouble.  You don't like someone so you wait for them to<br/>
post more than once an hour then do this to them.  Immature behavior.<br/>
 Thus far Catbead's been the lucky target.  <br/>
