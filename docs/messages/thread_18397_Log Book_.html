stamp, but I plan on memorializing them when they do. In the case of our<br/>
personal log book, I'm getting ready to replace it, so I'm going to take and<br/>
make a new log book, handmade cover and all, and carefully cut the stamps<br/>
from the existing book and then mount those, one to a page, in the<br/>
handcrafted one.  Add notes and such on the find and make a logbook that<br/>
will keep well, and use the old one for the trails.  I'm also going to scan<br/>
in the stamps so that I have a permanent record of them.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the letterbox log books, I'll more than likely scan those in to<br/>
immortalize them and may move them to a new log book as well for future<br/>
keeping.<br/>

across a zippered 6-hole daytimer-like binder.  I punched my own sheets from<br/>
cardstock to fit in it (as a bonus I found a Stickapotomous zippered pouch<br/>

I leave at home to keep them clean when I go out.<br/>

In other news...I heard a local Omaha paper ran an article about<br/>
