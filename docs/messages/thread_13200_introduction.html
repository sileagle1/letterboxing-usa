I am Stephanie, living in upstate NY, Adirondack area, on the Vermont border, and brand new to letterboxes. I will be gathering my supplies and such this weekend, and also hope to make it on a short journey to for my first stamp in my journal *grin* any suggestion's for a first letterbox hunt in the Whitehall, Granville, Glens Falls, Lake George NY area of over the state line into VT?<br/>
I have several ideas on places to plant some new letterboxes, now need the inspiration to make them fun with a great name, LOL<br/>
Look forward to getting to know everyone here, and sharing many happy discoveries as well.<br/>

Im passing this on to the local group of letterboxers because I am leaving<br/>
tomorrow for a four-month teaching posting in London.  Im looking forward,<br/>
among other things, to finding boxes in the original.<br/>
<br/>
I hope we can meet at the winter gathering when I return.  In the meantime,<br/>
I leave you in good hands.  Enjoy.<br/>

&gt; Conversation: introduction<br/>
&gt; Subject: introduction<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Dr. Bentley, <br/>
&gt; I am not sure if we have met before, but I just wanted to introduce myself. I<br/>
&gt; am a health policy analyst at the Center for Health Policy here at MU. I have<br/>
&gt; worked with a few of your J-school colleagues, but I do not believe we have<br/>
&gt; ever met before. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am not writing you related to work, however, but rather due to a mutual<br/>
&gt; hobby. I recently found a letterbox while wandering some local woods and have<br/>
&gt; been hooked ever since. So, I am a LB rookie and have much to learn but have<br/>
&gt; quickly become an avid fan.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I understand that you coordinate the gatherings of the local LB society here<br/>
&gt; in Mid-MO. Any information about the next event would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt; Also, please let me know if I could be of any assistance (planting boxes,<br/>
&gt; etc). I really enjoy letterboxing and would like to get more involved in the<br/>
&gt; LB community.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks, <br/>
&gt; Stan Hudson (ahistory)<br/>
