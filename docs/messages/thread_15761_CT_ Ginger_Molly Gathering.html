of all, I met people previously only known via stamps, posts and e-<br/>
mails.  Muchas gracias to Chuck, Chickabirdie, and Chickbirdies's  <br/>
sister who manned the grill and kept things tidied up. Awesome <br/>
Gathering which leaves so many pleasant memories and notes in my <br/>
letterbox journal.<br/>
Question:  Who put together the stamping activity table ("To plant a <br/>
garden is to believe in tomorrow"?  What a creative idea with such a <br/>
fine moral to the story, so to speak.<br/>
  See you on the trails soon, hopefully.<br/>

p.s.  Needeeps, thanks for setting me on the correct path re. the <br/>
Duck Blind l.B.<br/>
