Dear LBNA,<br/>
My letterboxing party was hunting for the Davis, CA letterbox today.  <br/>
It <br/>
is hidden in the University library, in a ceiling panel, and when we <br/>
retrieved the box, a library worker walked by as soon as we found <br/>
it.  She <br/>
reported our "suspicious acitivty" to her supervisor and security was <br/>
informed.  They barred the exits!!!  Therefore, so as to not make a <br/>
scene, <br/>
we approcahed the management and revealed the purpose of our <br/>
actions.  <br/>
They thought the box was in a dangerous place, and although they <br/>
understood the concept, they felt it necessary to move the box.  They <br/>
promised to leave future hunters a note on the ceiling panel to <br/>
direct <br/>
them to the front library desk, where they promised to keep the box.  <br/>
However, we don't want the box to become misplaced behind a desk, <br/>
therefore we contacted you.  Perhaps you can forward this message <br/>
to "Linda" the creator of the Davis Letterbox and she can decide if <br/>
she <br/>
wants to retrieve it from the library.<br/>
We feel terrible that the box was discovered, yet we were in a tight <br/>
situation and felt it necessary to explain ourselves to the library <br/>
staff.<br/>
<br/>
~Sincerely,<br/>
enthusiastic letterbox hunters<br/>

Ouch! That's totally my fault: Brianna had posted the webmasters and <br/>
I thoughtlessly forwarded her note here to the big list. The power of <br/>
a mouse click...many apologies...<br/>
