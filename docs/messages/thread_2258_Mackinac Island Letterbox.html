greenleelj@hotmail.com; Planted on Mackinac Island, Mackinac County, in<br/>
the Eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan on 25 April 2001.<br/>
<br/>
The East Bluff Letterbox: This island has many flights of stairs.  Up<br/>
more than 150 steps, one may wish to take a scenic detour, but the true<br/>
path lies behind the white bench.  Follow the escarpment.  When you<br/>
arrive at the error, you may spy a red marker; by this you will know<br/>
that you are on the right path.  But the error is too far - go back, go<br/>
up.  Leave the trail where the trees are down.  Walk away from the<br/>
water.  Here is another sign: when you cross the road, there is a<br/>
weathered heap of gray gravel on the landward side where you enter into<br/>
the forest again.  Under the cedars and beeches, you will find a<br/>
smallish hollow to your right and the land sloping downward to your<br/>
left.  Follow the humped ridge between them until it ends.  Just a<br/>
little further, a pine is fallen, its tip held up a few feet off the<br/>
ground.  It is pointed at you.  This is a larger tree; 1 feet in<br/>
diameter.  Look for the letterbox where the tree is broken.<br/>

I was contacted today by a represenative of the Mackinac Island <br/>
Historical Park. He was servicing a cannon and found a letterbox <br/>
called "Post Cemetery Letterbox" that was placed on 7/9/03 on <br/>
Mackinac Island. I believe he is contacting everyone who currently <br/>
has a listed box on the island in hopes of finding the placer. <br/>
Anyone out there know the history of this LB? He says the logbook is <br/>
filled and in good condition, but he can't figure out who placed the <br/>
box. Please contact me if you know anything @ bktassava@sbcglobal.net<br/>
