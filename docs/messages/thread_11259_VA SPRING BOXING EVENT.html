AAARGH!  I AM SO SORRY!!! <br/>
Absolutely - let me amend my earlier invitation/suggestion most humbly and with deepest regrets and apologies. I bow deeply and smack my forehead against the floor repeatedly in honest shame for any unfortunate misunderstanding my inadvertant error may have caused.<br/>
I'd like us to do an event open to anyone - MD, DC, WV, PA, NC, Delaware - whoever wants to come - all welcome!   Arms open particularly to MD and DC.  Interested?<br/>

<blockquote type="CITE">oooooo! So close by!! Sounds like a lot of fun!  The Water Mine is a great place!  It would have to be fairly late in the Spring to be warm enough to swim, no?  Do you have any dates in mind?  We would be interested in going!  (just have to work around one reunion and a class trip to Williamsburg!)  Thanks for thinking of this!  BeMa</blockquote><br/>
<br/>
I am totally in the survey stage. When's your reunion and Williamsburg trip?<br/>
<br/>
I want to make this as inclusive as possible and I really want to know what day of the week would be best, what month, any park suggestions, other activity suggestions, who would like to carve boxes for the event, who would like to set up any activities, etc?  How many people with kids would like to come and what would they like their kids to do? How many people would like to bring their dogs?<br/>
<br/>
One person has told me that Lake Fairfax park may not have good enough trails and be too visible.  I've only driven through it and don't know it well.  In the Fairfax Co area there's also Fountainedhead Park, Ellanor Wallace and Riverbend.  Anyone know of other good suggestions?  <br/>
<br/>
I was sort of thinking of maybe early June now but what does everyone think?  <br/>
So far one person has said that Sundays would be the only day that he could come due to his work schedule.</body></html>

<p>Sorry, Fairfax County spring break is April 14-18.  It is very late this year.  We should be free all week....all day....  My family loves activities and structure so too much time off with nothing to do is hard!  </p>
<p>Hope you all had a great weekend!  We got out in the woods and it was so nice to be in the sun!  </p>
<p>Today is a teacher work day and I'm thinking we might head out to Candy Cane City and check that place out.  Can it be as cool as it sounds?!  BeMa<br/><br/></p></div></div>
