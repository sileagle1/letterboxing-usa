While camping in Northern California, the kayaking cousins, Amanda<br/>
Briles and Lori Lott placed a letterbox at Ahjumawi State Park.        <br/>
The birdlife is delightful.  White Pelicans were everywhere when we were<br/>
paddling.  Grebes and Osprey were also sighted.  Tons of great<br/>
dragonflies grace this place.  Very large and diverse.  <br/>
<br/>
There is also a number of other insect life, which are not so pleasant.<br/>
They say there are ticks, but we never saw any.  Plenty of mosquitos,<br/>
though.  I was a walking smorgasborg for these feasting beasts and I<br/>
probably have 30 or so mosquitos bites on me (I wish I were<br/>
exaggerating, but I got really depressed and stopped counting after 17<br/>
on just one leg!)  The one thing you should make sure you pack is bug<br/>
repellent.  PLENTY OF IT and spray it on every part of your body or they<br/>
will get your where you're vulnerable.  Sunblock is also a must  This<br/>
public service message is brought to you by the Paisley Orca, aka The<br/>
Bitten One.<br/>

JA SHE CREEK  LETTERBOX - Placed by Amanda Briles and Lori Lott on June<br/>
23, 2001 <br/>
---------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Ahjumawi in the Pit River Indian language means "place where many waters<br/>
come together".  Ja She means "place where the tules grow".<br/>
<br/>
Ahjumawi State Park can only be accessed by boat and you must get a map<br/>
so you can find the proper campground to paddle or motor to.  California<br/>
State Parks can probably send you one, or you may be able to pick one up<br/>
at McArthur-Burney Falls State Park, which is not too far away from<br/>
Ahjumawi.  <br/>
<br/>
Location:  Ja She Creek Campground, Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park,<br/>
McArthur, California, Shasta County.  McArthur, California is located on<br/>
Hwy 299 and is Southeast of Mt. Shasta.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions:  Head North on Main Street for 3.7 miles.  You will come to<br/>
a parking lot/boat launch area.  This is the Rat Farm boat launch where<br/>
your journey begins.  <br/>
<br/>
Terrain:  Approximately 3 miles on water and a very short hike to the<br/>
letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  EASY<br/>
<br/>
Get out of your vehicle, put your boat in. When you get out into the big<br/>
water area start heading<br/>
left.  Ja She is between 2-1/2 to 3 miles from Rat Farm boat launch on<br/>
the other side of the water.  Head for the farthest campground, which is<br/>
Ja She Creek.  It is in an inlet and is a popular fishing area.  You may<br/>
be able to tell which campground it is  because it has a restroom and<br/>
camping sign next to a very small concrete ramp.  Definitely get a map.<br/>
My instructions may not adequately get you there since it's on the water<br/>
and not on a road. <br/>
<br/>
Once you get to the concrete boat launch head straight on the trail<br/>
until you get to a red rock strip over a rusty culvert.  From the middle<br/>
of this strip of volcanic rock go forward 25 steps and stop.  Beneath<br/>
and behind the large rock to your right is the Ja She Creek Letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
