Why should they have all the fun. If you (or anyone<br/>

(carvers will be acknowledged as such) for planting by<br/>

available for these tired, retired postal, elderly and<br/>
arthritic stamps that wish to retire and move south to<br/>
enjoy life in Florida and have locals as well as<br/>
tourists stop by for a visit.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of course they will.  It is the only way to get here. <br/>
Today is nice and balmy with temps in the lower 70's. <br/>
Winter only comes here in waves lasting no more than 3<br/>
days at a time and only for a few hours of each of<br/>
those days.  Hurricanes are no problem because the<br/>
homes for the retirees are checked during the season. <br/>
If an impending storm seems likely then the poor souls<br/>
are moved to a more secure location until the danger<br/>
is past.<br/>
<br/>
So if you wish to send along your tired, re-tired,<br/>
arthritic, postal and/or other type stamps just ask<br/>
for our address (off list from your own email) and we<br/>
will comply.  No container necessary as we will<br/>
provide.  Logbooks will also be provided if you wish,<br/>
or you can send your own.  Please include any story<br/>
about the stamp, it's travels, problems, history, etc.<br/>
 This information will be included in the clue<br/>
information to peak others interest in visiting the<br/>
retiree.<br/>
