                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just looked over the photos of your fun event.  For me, it was <br/>
special seeing what Wisconsin Hiker &amp; Martini Man look like.  I just <br/>
saw your stamps in the Columbia Gorge Falls series when I went out on <br/>
Sunday -- at least, in the boxes I found!  I read your comments of the <br/>
event.  I especially love the Alice In Wonderland food/snacks that were <br/>
brought.  What fun!<br/>
<br/>
It was also great to see RaqsEnigma in photos, as I just met her a few <br/>
weeks ago when she was visiting the Portland area.  She is so much <br/>
fun.  I hope she visits us again, soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing and I hope to meet some of you when you visit <br/>
Portland, Oregon.  I'd love to go LB'ing with you!<br/>
