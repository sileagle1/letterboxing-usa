several densely letterboxed parks were hit by someone stealing the <br/>

The geocaching world has a requirement that caches be placed at least <br/>
1/10 mile apart.  That is easy to check as they all have coordinates.  <br/>
That spreads the caches out.<br/>

I like finding new parks when I go letterboxing.  That is part of the <br/>
fun for me.  So I like it when I can visit a park I did not know about <br/>
before.  My suggestion is to find a park without any boxes and be the <br/>
first to plant a box there.  Your visitors will be pleased.<br/>

<br/>
Exactly :-)  Obviously you *do* know a fair amount about that game. <br/>
The rule helps keep things from getting so full of caches that an area<br/>
is in risk of being trashed.<br/>
<br/>
Considering that there is a recent thread about confusing LBs and<br/>
caches, let me state that I've run into this at least five times.  In<br/>
two of them, the cache had been there for more than a year before the<br/>
LB, in one the LB had at least a couple of years on the cache; can't<br/>
recall the situation in the others.  The only reason I remember the<br/>
two so well is that one of former is the first LB I ever found, and<br/>
the other was at a spot that I was showing to a friend.  He'd just<br/>
started caching a few months before; the cache there had been planted<br/>
just after my last visit, more than a year before that.  While looking<br/>
for the cache we found a letterbox that had only been there a couple<br/>
of months.  I hadn't even thought to look in the listings before we<br/>
visited, as it is a couple of hundred miles from home :-o  Yeah, I<br/>
learned my lesson!  Anyway, the LB owner knew about the cache, and<br/>
made a point to write in the box that it was *not* the cache, but<br/>
invited cachers who found it to sign the log, but please leave the<br/>
stamp.  Several cachers signed the log and made positive comments :-)<br/>
 Two other LBs in this situation also had notes to that effect.  And<br/>
at least a couple of the caches in that situation have had notes<br/>
warning people not to disturb a nearby LB.  I can't speak for the East<br/>
Coast, but maybe we're just easier-going about all of this Way Out<br/>
West.  I never hear about major conflicts between boxing and caching<br/>
in California; too many of us do both :-)<br/>
<br/>
It isn't hard for LBers to find out if there are nearby caches where<br/>
they want to hide a letterbox: Google Maps is your friend :-)  Cachers<br/>
are becoming more aware of letterboxes; I've done my very small part<br/>
in that area, and will continue to try to educate geocachers.  TPtB in<br/>
geocaching have made a point to try to educate cachers about LB, and<br/>
have long provided a link to LbNA.  I would really like to see less<br/>
confrontation and disapproval between the two groups, as they each<br/>
have a lot to offer the other.<br/>

<br/>
That's not fair! The geocache coords get you within a 50 foot circle <br/>
and the find is usually a piece of cake. Geocachers are as worried <br/>
about leaving a mark on nature as letterboxers. If letterboxers would <br/>
put a coord on their Lb, geocachers would know where they are and plant <br/>
accordingly, but until letterboxers and geocachers start talking there <br/>
is going to be overlap. <br/>
<br/>
There are two that I know or that the geocacher warns potential finders <br/>
that the Lbs are in the area...has worked out so far.<br/>

I was out today looking for a letterbox. The clues said to look in the direction of the large tree by the river. I checked the base and surrounding area of the first large tree, not there. There were 2 other largish trees along the river so I went a checked those too, covering about 30x25 square feet of area as I walked from tree to tree and checked around each one. The box was not there.

I would guess that such a search may be typical for many letterboxers. The clues don't take to right to the box, there's still some searching to do and you may have to check a few trees, stumps, rocks, ledges etc before you find it. And like in the example above, sometimes you're in the right area but don't see the box right away so you search elsewhere before you return to the right location for a closer look. A 30-50 square foot circle of searching is probably quite normal for both geocache searches and letterbox searches. <br/>

<br/>
Cases in point--I have 2 boxes in close proximity to caches.  The first one has a permit from the park &amp; has been in place about 2 years.   As of a few months ago there is a cache that's no more than 15 feet away--but it's not a problem, because the cache is in the obvious place at the scenic overlook.  My box is tucked into the rocks all the way at the back, and nobody's going to start looking there.  <br/>
<br/>
With the other box, when I got to the spot where I wanted to plant, I found there was a geocache already there.  But again, it was in the obvious place--big old ammo box next to a very distinctive tree right on trail, with branches like a lean-to "concealing" it.  Nobody could not find that cache!  And once they do, nobody's going to come looking any further back in the woods where my letterbox is.... <br/>

Some caches make good neighbors.  =)<br/>

Yeah, but the important thing would be if letterboxers and geocacher <br/>
would at least be aware of each other in the area. The geocachers are <br/>
used to letting the GPS tell them where to go, and I am guessing they <br/>
won't be patient enough to follow letterboxer clues to see if they of <br/>
far enough away from a letterbox. I know it would be hard, but as both <br/>

<br/>
In the few years I've been out letterboxing -- about 5 or 6 now -- I haven't<br/>
run directly into that many geocachers.  Maybe a dozen times or so, maybe a<br/>
few more than a dozen.<br/>
<br/>
But they were busy trashing the surrounding environment trying to find a<br/>
cache every.  single.  time.<br/>
<br/>
So count me amongst those who has come to detest geocachers.  I'm sure there<br/>
are responsible geocachers out there. I just haven't met up with any yet on<br/>
the trail.  At least I sure hope there are some responsible ones out there.<br/>
There's nothing as good for promoting responsible environmental habits as<br/>
giving exact clues to the location of a box at the very end of the clues.<br/>
Just because of all the idiots who really don't give a hoot about the<br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
The times they are a'changin'.  The environment out there is not a videogame<br/>
that's going to return everything to "normal-just-as-it-was" condition when<br/>
the gamer shuts down the game and walks away from their computer.  I think<br/>
there are many folks who either don't quite realize that or who just don't<br/>
care.  The "rule", as you state, might be one thing.  What folks are<br/>
actually doing may be something else completely. Kind of like the "rule" of<br/>
the 55mph speed limit.  :-)<br/>

I'm going to try very hard to be charitable, here; my initial<br/>
rteaction was definitely of the "flame" variety, and I would just as<br/>
soon not get into that...<br/>

&gt; That 1/10 mile is so they can trample everything and discover the<br/>

<br/>
Truly spoken like someone who does not know of what they are speaking.<br/>
 The rule is to "prevent" trampling of the wilderness.  I would have<br/>
taken the first two sentences as mere sarcasm had you not written the<br/>
third one, which shows that you were being serious in your comments.<br/>
As someone who does both caching and boxing, I take umbrage at those<br/>
on either side who show a lack of knowledge of the other, and display<br/>
it as you did.  I've written often enough in here about the<br/>
differences, and the similarities, between the two.  You don't have to<br/>
enjoy both; you can certainly choose to only do one, or the other;<br/>
most people do only one.  I don't get that narrow attitude, but<br/>
whatever.  In the future, I would ask that you learn a little more<br/>
about the subject of your displeasure before you attack it.<br/>

&gt; The geocaching world has a requirement that caches be placed at<br/>
&gt; least 1/10 mile apart.  That is easy to check as they all have<br/>
&gt; coordinates.  That spreads the caches out.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly :-)  Obviously you *do* know a fair amount about that game.<br/>
The rule helps keep things from getting so full of caches that an area<br/>
is in risk of being trashed.<br/>
<br/>
Considering that there is a recent thread about confusing LBs and<br/>
caches, let me state that I've run into this at least five times.  In<br/>
two of them, the cache had been there for more than a year before the<br/>
LB, in one the LB had at least a couple of years on the cache; can't<br/>
recall the situation in the others.  The only reason I remember the<br/>
two so well is that one of former is the first LB I ever found, and<br/>
the other was at a spot that I was showing to a friend.  He'd just<br/>
started caching a few months before; the cache there had been planted<br/>
just after my last visit, more than a year before that.  While looking<br/>
for the cache we found a letterbox that had only been there a couple<br/>
of months.  I hadn't even thought to look in the listings before we<br/>
visited, as it is a couple of hundred miles from home :-o  Yeah, I<br/>
learned my lesson!  Anyway, the LB owner knew about the cache, and<br/>
made a point to write in the box that it was *not* the cache, but<br/>
invited cachers who found it to sign the log, but please leave the<br/>
stamp.  Several cachers signed the log and made positive comments :-)<br/>
 Two other LBs in this situation also had notes to that effect.  And<br/>
at least a couple of the caches in that situation have had notes<br/>
warning people not to disturb a nearby LB.  I can't speak for the East<br/>
Coast, but maybe we're just easier-going about all of this Way Out<br/>
West.  I never hear about major conflicts between boxing and caching<br/>
in California; too many of us do both :-)<br/>
<br/>
It isn't hard for LBers to find out if there are nearby caches where<br/>
they want to hide a letterbox: Google Maps is your friend :-)  Cachers<br/>
are becoming more aware of letterboxes; I've done my very small part<br/>
in that area, and will continue to try to educate geocachers.  TPtB in<br/>
geocaching have made a point to try to educate cachers about LB, and<br/>
have long provided a link to LbNA.  I would really like to see less<br/>
confrontation and disapproval between the two groups, as they each<br/>
have a lot to offer the other.<br/>

accidentally discover your box and trade-out your stamp, that you put a<br/>
very short attention-getting note in your letterbox explaining what a<br/>
letterbox is and how to play the game. I leave a little yellow business<br/>
card size note<br/>
<http: box-note\<br="" images="" lone-r="" make_a_letterbox="" planet="" www.angelfire.com="">
-do-not-trade-large.gif&gt;   that says, "Please leave the stamp in the<br/>
box. No trades. If you carry a personal letterbox "passport", take an<br/>
impression of the letterbox's stamp. If you carry a signature stamp,<br/>
leave an impression in the logbook." I also write with permanent ink on<br/>
the backside of the stamp "Leave in box. Do not trade."<br/>
<br/>
It has worked for me. I've been letterboxing since 2002 and only had one<br/>
stamp traded-out from a letterbox because, in that case, I didn't put in<br/>
the note and I didn't write on the back of the stamp. It was promptly<br/>
returned to me when I contacted the cacher (he left an online log on<br/>
gc.com saying that he traded for the stamp).<br/>

  Another good defense is not to plant in THE obvious spot. The one you see from the trail, and think "Wow, what a great place for a box,,,,"--well, that's the one cachers are going to home in on. Pass that one up, leave it for the geocachers.<br/>
<br/>
  Cases in point--I have 2 boxes in close proximity to caches. The first one has a permit from the park &amp; has been in place about 2 years. As of a few months ago there is a cache that's no more than 15 feet away--but it's not a problem, because the cache is in the obvious place at the scenic overlook. My box is tucked into the rocks all the way at the back, and nobody's going to start looking there. <br/>
<br/>
  With the other box, when I got to the spot where I wanted to plant, I found there was a geocache already there. But again, it was in the obvious place--big old ammo box next to a very distinctive tree right on trail, with branches like a lean-to "concealing" it. Nobody could not find that cache! And once they do, nobody's going to come looking any further back in the woods where my letterbox is.... <br/>
<br/>
  Some caches make good neighbors. =)<br/>

&gt; Well, you can flame ME all ya want :-) but..................<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the few years I've been out letterboxing -- about 5 or 6 now -- <br/>
I haven't<br/>
&gt; run directly into that many geocachers.  Maybe a dozen times or so, <br/>
maybe a<br/>
&gt; few more than a dozen.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But they were busy trashing the surrounding environment trying to <br/>
find a<br/>
&gt; cache every.  single.  time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So count me amongst those who has come to detest geocachers.  I'm <br/>
sure there<br/>
&gt; are responsible geocachers out there. I just haven't met up with <br/>
any yet on<br/>
&gt; the trail.  At least I sure hope there are some responsible ones <br/>
out there.<br/>
&gt; There's nothing as good for promoting responsible environmental <br/>
habits as<br/>
&gt; giving exact clues to the location of a box at the very end of the <br/>
clues.<br/>
&gt; Just because of all the idiots who really don't give a hoot about <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; environment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The times they are a'changin'.  The environment out there is not a <br/>
videogame<br/>
&gt; that's going to return everything to "normal-just-as-it-was" <br/>
condition when<br/>
&gt; the gamer shuts down the game and walks away from their computer.  <br/>
I think<br/>
&gt; there are many folks who either don't quite realize that or who <br/>
just don't<br/>
&gt; care.  The "rule", as you state, might be one thing.  What folks are<br/>
&gt; actually doing may be something else completely. Kind of like <br/>
the "rule" of<br/>
&gt; the 55mph speed limit.  :-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; That 1/10 mile is so they can trample everything and discover the<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes that are also hidden close by. Getting close doesn't <br/>
get<br/>
&gt; &gt; you close enough.  That's my major complaint about geocaching.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Truly spoken like someone who does not know of what they are <br/>
speaking.<br/>
&gt;  The rule is to "prevent" trampling of the wilderness.  I would have<br/>
&gt; taken the first two sentences as mere sarcasm had you not written <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; third one, which shows that you were being serious in your comments.<br/>
&gt; As someone who does both caching and boxing, I take umbrage at those<br/>
&gt; on either side who show a lack of knowledge of the other, and <br/>
display<br/>
&gt; it as you did.  I've written often enough in here about the<br/>
&gt; differences, and the similarities, between the two.  You don't have <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; enjoy both; you can certainly choose to only do one, or the other;<br/>
&gt; most people do only one.  I don't get that narrow attitude, but<br/>
&gt; whatever.  In the future, I would ask that you learn a little more<br/>

&gt; &gt; The geocaching world has a requirement that caches be placed at<br/>
&gt; &gt; least 1/10 mile apart.  That is easy to check as they all have<br/>
&gt; &gt; coordinates.  That spreads the caches out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Exactly :-)  Obviously you *do* know a fair amount about that game.<br/>
&gt; The rule helps keep things from getting so full of caches that an <br/>
area<br/>
&gt; is in risk of being trashed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Considering that there is a recent thread about confusing LBs and<br/>
&gt; caches, let me state that I've run into this at least five times.  <br/>
In<br/>
&gt; two of them, the cache had been there for more than a year before <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; LB, in one the LB had at least a couple of years on the cache; can't<br/>
&gt; recall the situation in the others.  The only reason I remember the<br/>
&gt; two so well is that one of former is the first LB I ever found, and<br/>
&gt; the other was at a spot that I was showing to a friend.  He'd just<br/>
&gt; started caching a few months before; the cache there had been <br/>
planted<br/>
&gt; just after my last visit, more than a year before that.  While <br/>
looking<br/>
&gt; for the cache we found a letterbox that had only been there a couple<br/>
&gt; of months.  I hadn't even thought to look in the listings before we<br/>
&gt; visited, as it is a couple of hundred miles from home :-o  Yeah, I<br/>
&gt; learned my lesson!  Anyway, the LB owner knew about the cache, and<br/>
&gt; made a point to write in the box that it was *not* the cache, but<br/>
&gt; invited cachers who found it to sign the log, but please leave the<br/>
&gt; stamp.  Several cachers signed the log and made positive comments :-<br/>
)<br/>
&gt;  Two other LBs in this situation also had notes to that effect.  And<br/>
&gt; at least a couple of the caches in that situation have had notes<br/>
&gt; warning people not to disturb a nearby LB.  I can't speak for the <br/>
East<br/>
&gt; Coast, but maybe we're just easier-going about all of this Way Out<br/>
&gt; West.  I never hear about major conflicts between boxing and caching<br/>
&gt; in California; too many of us do both :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It isn't hard for LBers to find out if there are nearby caches where<br/>
&gt; they want to hide a letterbox: Google Maps is your friend :-)  <br/>
Cachers<br/>
&gt; are becoming more aware of letterboxes; I've done my very small part<br/>
&gt; in that area, and will continue to try to educate geocachers.  TPtB <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; geocaching have made a point to try to educate cachers about LB, and<br/>
&gt; have long provided a link to LbNA.  I would really like to see less<br/>
&gt; confrontation and disapproval between the two groups, as they each<br/>
&gt; have a lot to offer the other.<br/>
