<br/>
I had some time to get a preliminary version of the I-95 Letterboxes <br/>
page ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
There are many missing states, as I-95 runs from Maine to Florida. <br/>
Please stop by, check it out and help me fill up this page with <br/>
letterboxes! We are looking for boxes that are quick, easy and within <br/>
15 miles or less from the highway.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help and to those letterboxers who have already <br/>
emailed us with their contributions. We hope that this page will help <br/>
all of those letterboxers as they hit the I-95 highway this coming <br/>
vacation season.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun &amp; just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
