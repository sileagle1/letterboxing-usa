   I have found that Defygravity has the site for our travellers. You <br/>
go to Groups Home at the top right of this page. Then join, a group <br/>
letterbox_travellers. Go to links and click on Hitcher Tracking Page <br/>
by Wanda and Pete. Wanda and Pete have a wonderful HH page. All HH's <br/>
out there are already listed. All you have to do when you have found <br/>
a HH, is to post where you found it, when, and who found it. NOT <br/>
where you plan on placing it. Post in the traveller site or to <br/>
wandaandpete. <br/>
    I know that many boxers would like to know where their HH's have <br/>
travelled. I see posts just about everyday where the question is "Has <br/>
anybody seen?" or "Does anyone know the whereabouts of?" <br/>
    Posting on this site will help diminish the same old questions <br/>

  It's not too difficult or confusing to have a tracking page at all. <br/>

I have to filter through stuff I don't need.   Letterbox_traveller <br/>

What I meant by complicated was not "difficult," rather just another <br/>
one more procedure, one more place to go and report things. I am not <br/>
much of a chat person and this is the first time I've joined a Yahoo <br/>
group.  Other than a couple of newsgroups I read occasionally, my <br/>
computer is used primarily for e-mail and work and desktop publishing <br/>
and web design, etc.  Going to check out various groups to find out <br/>
information of the same nature, just seems redundant, especially <br/>
since so many people post their HH info here anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't mean to stir the water, just curious why two different <br/>
groups.  I will just keep doing as I have been doing...  if it ain't <br/>
broke, don't fix it.<br/>
