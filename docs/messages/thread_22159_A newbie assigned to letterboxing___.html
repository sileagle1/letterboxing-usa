three different letterboxing trails: one involving the general <br/>

replica Cheyenne Indian camp.  I have a few basic questions-I know <br/>
they might sound stupid-is this like a scavenger hunt type thing where <br/>
you leave clues at every landmark?  Do you write a story involving the <br/>
trail or do you just write stuff like "take 20 paces to the east"?  <br/>
Any help would be appreciated-our program is severely lacking!<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
