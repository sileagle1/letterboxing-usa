                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone! I'm pretty new to this letterboxing "thing," and <br/>
already I'm hooked! <br/>
<br/>
To make a short story long, on a snowy day in March, myself and <br/>
two friends found our first boxes at Ringing Rocks in <br/>
Pennsylvania. What I found amazing is that I've been there a <br/>
number of times before, and never thought that I'd be walking by <br/>
all of these secret treasures!<br/>
<br/>
Well, finding those boxes was all it took. I planted three boxes of <br/>
my own, and invited a dozen friends to meet me at my house on <br/>
a Saturday morning in April for a letterboxing party. After I fed <br/>
them breakfast (donuts, bagels and coffee), and gave them little <br/>
notebooks and pens (I carved personalized stamps for each of <br/>
them as gifts), I had them form small groups and sent them out <br/>
on their way in 15-minute intervals, a printout of the clues in <br/>
hand. <br/>
<br/>
So, we had all of these cars passing each other on the roads, as <br/>
groups headed off to different directions. Sometimes two groups <br/>
would bump into each other at a street or parking lot, with the <br/>
departing group smiling all smugly! Four hours later, we all met <br/>
at the location of the third letterbox, posed for pictures, and went <br/>
out for a late lunch to celebrate. <br/>
<br/>
The Perfect Circle Letterboxing Guild was born.<br/>
<br/>
So, now that the first three clues have been "road-tested," I'll be <br/>
posting them up to this discussion group. The clues are all pretty <br/>
easy, as I was letting my friends get their feet wet before I ramp <br/>
up the difficulty level. But, the locations are fun, scenic, or <br/>
interesting (or a combination thereof).<br/>
<br/>
If you wish, you can just go to our website and get all of the <br/>
clues (or laugh at our pictures):<br/>

I hope everyone enjoys finding our boxes. If you have any <br/>
suggestions or comments to make, please write to me and let <br/>
me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and have fun!<br/>

Wow...It makes me feel really great when people mention that they got <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
I'm new to letterboxing, but am having a wonderful time researching <br/>
it.  I am planning a weekend retreat for a group of rubberstampers at <br/>
a camp in Michigan, and thought it would be great fun to have <br/>
letterboxing as one of the things to do.  I need some help figuring <br/>
out exactly where to start.  We are going out to the camp to check <br/>
out the grounds, and then I guess the next step is planning the clues <br/>
and maps.  Any ideas and or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. <br/>
The sad part is that the camp is on private property, so the boxes <br/>
must be removed at the end of the retreat, however, maybe it will <br/>
spark an interest in some of the local letterbox "sites" in our area!<br/>
Again, thanks for any information you can offer.<br/>

Like any adventure, rewards may, or may not happen.  That which you  <br/>
seek today may not be found until tomorrow.  It's in the quest that  <br/>
joy happens.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck tomorrow, and for all the tomorrows to come.  May you be  <br/>
blest with the findings, and skilled at the plantings!<br/>
<br/>
Little lost nuts may not always be found, on first search.  Quest on  <br/>
regardless.  If not the first day, then perhaps the day after that  <br/>
you'll find what you seek.  It is the quest worthy of an Atlas!<br/>
