                    <div class="plaintext-content">As I recall the Nat. Park rule language is more like "no letterboxes <br/>
or geocaches may be placed 'without permission.'"  Correct me if I <br/>
am wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I believe we shouldn't even think of asking to place a box in parks <br/>
that are popular, historically significant or environmentally <br/>
sensitive.  But there are small parks that might be appropriate and <br/>
whose rangers might be receptive.<br/>
<br/>
We had a bad experience with a local gestapo like NP security person <br/>
but I also know personally of other NP people who do not object to <br/>
discrete and careful placements in a low profile park.<br/>

&gt; Dicknoone makes my point here; National parks in my area and all <br/>
&gt; over the country allow activities that have far more impact on the <br/>
&gt; parks than our Tupperware. Many parks allow hunting, recreational <br/>
&gt; vehicle traffic, camping, hiking, skiing, biking, rock climbing,  <br/>
&gt; logging, and oil drilling! Yes I'm sure balancing many demands is <br/>
&gt; difficult but a blanket exclusion of letterboxing while allowing <br/>
&gt; logging and oil drilling hardly seems like a considered and well <br/>
&gt; reasoned ruling (and, I'm sorry, is dismissive and smacks of <br/>
&gt; apathetic disregard). Furthermore, I'll save the high-minded <br/>
&gt; rhetoric for the united front of course, but I think we need a <br/>
&gt; little rabble rousing and frustration venting to stir the rank and <br/>
&gt; file into action.<br/>
