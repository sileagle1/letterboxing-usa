already be in the neighborhood of said Sacred Holy Place (blessed be <br/>

<br/>
My sense from reading the posts and from the number of people in just <br/>
our car alone, maybe 20-30?  But I could be waaaaay off, in terms of <br/>
*under*estimation.<br/>
<br/>
And I am assuming that this is a rain or shine event?<br/>
<br/>
These are good things to know, especially for those of us coming in <br/>
from out of state.<br/>
<br/>
But as this is a mystery gathering, perhaps we'll not find out until <br/>
we get there ...<br/>

Rain or more rain.  It appears that many who have placed special <br/>
boxes for the event were thoughtful enough to place them close to <br/>
cover.<br/>
