The question you raise is interesting. My personal opinion is that a<br/>
replacement box in the same place with the same clues, even though the stamp<br/>
may be different, is not an additional P. I also think that a different<br/>
location and different set of clues, while the name stays the same, is not a<br/>
different P.<br/>
<br/>
My Whales Tails box changed its location and its clues when the landmark for<br/>
which it was named was physically moved to another town! But I did not feel<br/>
that my P count should change when I revised the clues. I did not have to<br/>
carve a new stamp in this case.<br/>
<br/>
I can easily imnagine, however, that other people could have quite different<br/>
opinions from mine on this issue! A very nice point, as lawyers say.<br/>

&gt; Hello All -<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here's a quick post outlining our recent joys and disappointments of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  We have confirmed Bill &amp; Val's claim that the Eubrontes<br/>
&gt; Letterbox (2nd in the Walk Through Geologic Time series) is missing.<br/>
&gt; Sad to see the first stamp I ever carved go missing.  Due to it's<br/>
&gt; apparent popularity and the amount of "marketing" it's received :') it<br/>
&gt; will be replaced soon.  The day, however, was not a total loss.  When we<br/>
&gt; went to check on Trilobite, we soon heard voices coming down the trail<br/>
&gt; reciting the clues to our box.  We quickly replaced it and dashed off<br/>
&gt; down the trail.  HELLO to Jenny, Eric and Uncle Joe (and company).  We<br/>
&gt; waited at the trail intersection for them to stamp in and also to warn<br/>
&gt; them that "Eubrontes is dead!" before they tramped all the way to the<br/>
&gt; other end of the park to find out for themselves (not an enjoyable<br/>
&gt; experience, especially with small children along).  Because we only<br/>
&gt; intended to ckeck on the status of Eubrontes, we were not carrying our<br/>
&gt; full array of letterboxing paraphenalia and couldn't even exchange<br/>
&gt; stamps on the trail :'(  We did manage to end the day on a good note -<br/>
&gt; Uncle Joe &amp; Co. had left a hitchhiker at Trilobite which we recovered<br/>
&gt; when we went back to finish reviewing the log book.  Watch for an update<br/>
&gt; soon on Eubrontes 2: Return From Extinction and other possible additions<br/>
&gt; to the Walk Through Geologic Time series.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; S.Pike &amp; Frogger<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S.  We have been debating whether/how to count replacement boxes.  If<br/>
&gt; you need to replace a box, does it at all affect your P count?? What if<br/>
&gt; it's a new stamp design?? What if it's in a new location?? Or is it<br/>
&gt; still just a replacement???  Any thoughts???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.P.S  The owner of the State Symbols series may be interested to know<br/>
&gt; that Eubrontes is the official state fossil of Connecticut.  We had also<br/>
&gt; been toying with the idea of a similar series.<br/>

As far as changing clues or stamp design, it's still a replacement--as <br/>
long as that was the intent.<br/>
<br/>
However, not every missing box needs to be replaced (I am not <br/>
encouraging you to abandon this idea though!) The planter would have <br/>
to weigh pros and cons and personal feelings on replacement or to let <br/>
it be retired.<br/>
