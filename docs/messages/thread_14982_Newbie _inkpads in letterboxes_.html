am also a newbie, and assumed from what I had read elsewhere that I <br/>
was supposed to include an inkpad in every box. But when the subject <br/>
came up here, and I found out that most do not include one. I am <br/>
really glad we are not expected to include the inkpad, because with <br/>
the extreme heat in South Texas, the ink would be dried up in no <br/>
time!<br/>
<br/>
I have only found 1 letterbox so far, and it did not have an ink <br/>
pad, which was fine, because I always carry serveral.  <br/>

Wanda (Busy Bee)...who just placed another letterbox this morning. :)<br/>
