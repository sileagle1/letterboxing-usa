<p><strong>Leonards Bridge Station</strong></p>
<p><strong>Placed: 5-11-02</strong></p>
<p><strong>Placed By: Chuck and Molly</strong></p>
<p><strong>Location: Lebanon Connecticut, New London 
County</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rated: Moderate</strong></p>
<p><strong>At the intersection of Routes 66 and 85 in Hebron, take 
route 85 south headed for Colchester. Proceed until you come to Route 207 and 
turn left onto 207. Proceed down route 207 passing Lake Williams on your left 
and Grand Lake Spa on the right. You will soon come to Leonards bridge road on 
your left. Take this left turn and travel 1.8 miles, passing one stop sign to a 
place for a school bus turn around and the old rail road line. It is a difficult 
place to park. Park your car and cross the street going down the hill to the old 
rail bed. This is where the old wooden bridge once stood, at a time when 
Leonards Bridge had its own rail road station along the air line. It is 
frequently very muddy and wet here for a short distance. Proceed down the path 
until you come to another trail which goes off to your right. Take this trail it 
seems to be a semi circle which the rail road built and it comes back onto the 
main track. You will only travel down it to a point where you can see where a 
stream goes under it and comes out on the left side of the trail. Go down the 
steep hill, or find an easier way to this point. View the double small tunnels 
under the trail you were on. Follow the stream as best you can along the many 
trails made by dirt bikes until you find where the stream goes under the main 
rail line. Here you will find a beautiful tunnel which is tall enough to walk 
through. Stand on top of the huge rock capping the tunnel. Stand directly over 
the top of the beginning of the tunnel. Take a reading of 50 degrees. Follow 
that to three trees which grow from one. From those three trees go directly 
north to a rock. On the northeast side of the rock surrounded by smaller rocks, 
you must lift up the two flat rocks and find the Leonards Bridge 
Letterbox.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To make your trip more interesting: when you enter 
Leonards Bridge Road from Route 207 stop at almost 1.6 miles at 78 Leonards 
Bridge Road, just a bit short of your parking spot. See the old tombstone by the 
side of the road. This is not a cemetery but a single tombstone. It was not just 
placed there but is an actual grave site. At some point a stone wall was built 
which went right through the grave site and the tomb stone became a part of the 
wall. It remained that way for many years until the recent owner took down part 
of the wall and cleaned up around the stone. The stone very clearly reads 
"Sacred to the memory of Mr. Constant Woodworth who after a virtuous &amp; 
exemplary life died with the Small-Pox April the 13<sup>th</sup> 1777 in the 
49<sup>th</sup> year of his age."</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is also a stone marker in the yard behind the 
lilac trees right next to the school bus turn around which tells of the history 
of the owners of that property.</strong></p>
