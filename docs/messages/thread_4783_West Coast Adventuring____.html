6 of 7 of the Palo Alto boxes are gone. Multiple people have reported <br/>
this. <br/>
<br/>
The Uvas canyon box is close to highway 101 but takes 1.5-2 hours to <br/>
find. But the park is really nice and a good place to spend a little <br/>
time.  I recently posted this box to the list.<br/>

Ryan, I found the Byxbee Park letterboxes #1 AND #2 on November 18, <br/>
2001. #1 was not an easy find. So that makes 5 of 7 for me. All the <br/>
other ones are almost certainly gone. Across the Bay, at SF Bay <br/>
Wildlife Refuge #2 and #3 were there at the begining of November. Check <br/>
it out...Funhog<br/>

two letterboxes in Santa Rosa CA (my beloved hometown) are shortneasy <br/>
and just off the "Redwood Highway." The stamps aren't our best, but <br/>
both sites would be wonderful respites from the first real traffic <br/>
you'll see south of the Oregon border.<br/>

was in place.  This is just a short drive off the 101.  The turnoff <br/>
is easy to miss, so start watching for the Nojoqui Falls sign just <br/>
south of Buellton.<br/>
Everything is green &amp; beautiful there right now.<br/>
