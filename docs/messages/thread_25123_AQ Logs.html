Of course I just learned if I log it as a find under my planter name it doesn't actually come up as a find - Good Thing.  So I think that might be a good way of reflecting I actually did some maintenance in case someone is planning on finding.<br/>

So 197 planted and 3 maintained!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Silly. =) I decided not to do that anymore. Matter of fact I deleted a few (ok, a few hundred....) It's very liberating.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;      Hmmm, ya know that's a thought.... I just might delete them all. The logging I did is not a very accurate picture of my boxing history so why have any on there at all?<br/>
