<div><em>Hi everyone 
~</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em>While visiting my in-laws in 
Pennsylvania two weeks ago, we planted a Letterbox in their "neck of the woods" 
since they didn't have any close by.  My father-in-law wanted me to e-mail 
him the clues so he could go out and find the box himself.  I received this 
e-mail from him today and just had to share it with all of you.  I about 
peed my pants reading it!!  Some of you may not think it's very funny but 
if you knew my accident prone father-in-law, you would be rolling on the floor 
laughing with me.  </em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em>He's a 6'4" teddy bear in his 
early 60's ~ Mom is about 5' in her late 50's.  Gordon, who they 
reference in the e-mail is their pathetic, 7 year old Japanese Chin dog.  
</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em>Read on and enjoy!  Happy 
Labor Day to all.</em></div>

<div><br/></div><br/>Ellen,  What a day!  ..<br/><br/>We decided to go 
today.  It was cloudy and cool.  Seemed like a good day to 
<br/>go.  Only a 30% chance of rain.<br/>Yep.........by the time we got there 
it was pouring.  We said OK we're here <br/>so we'll get a little wet.  
Once on the trial it started to thunder and <br/>lightning.  Puddles got so 
deep, Gordon was up to water at his knees.  We <br/>were soaked thru and 
thru. <br/>I slipped in the mud a few times, but only fell once.  Mom, fell 
in a big <br/>puddle of water.  She had to pee and used this opportunity to 
go...she was <br/>laughing like hell. You had to be here to see this.  
<br/><br/>When I found the tree and where I thought the box was. I spotted a large 
<br/>spider web and as I pushed it aside a large "tarantula type" spider attacked 
<br/>me.  I now have a bite that has swollen up to the size of a 
silver  dollar on <br/>my wrist.<br/><br/>While preoccupied with being 
attacked and almost eaten alive, Gordon wandered <br/>away. He came back yelping 
and running faster than he ever did before. We <br/>thought a bear was after him. 
No, bear, just the biggest chipmunk you ever <br/>saw.  Vicious 
critter..........we thought it had rabies. After it left, we <br/>got down off of 
the big rock we had ran to for protection and then proceeded <br/>to get your 
letterbox.  I used a big stick this time to drag out the box from <br/>it's 
hiding spot.  Yes, it was still raining like hell and the damn spider 
<br/>was still around.<br/><br/>Then to top off a wonderful day...........I find 
out I was not the first to <br/>find your box. I had wanted to be first.  
Some guy named ...Silent <br/>Doug.....beat me.  <br/><br/>As I placed 
the box back, a loud clap of thunder hit and scared the shit out <br/>me.  I 
jumped back and fell, twisting my ankle.  Mom had to help me back to 
<br/>the car and drive home. I just got out of the hot tub, trying to soak my 
<br/>ankle and warm up my body which is cold to the bone.  Three aspirin 
have not <br/>as yet helped the pain of the ankle nor the spider bite.  Mom, 
wants me to go <br/>to the emergency room to have these checked out.<br/>I am 
going to wait and see how things go ...... and try some Gin therapy at 
<br/>5PM.  ;-)<br/><br/>Do you have any other letterboxes you want me to try 
and find.  If so, let me <br/>know. I will go on a day where maybe I'll only 
experience a hurricane or get <br/>West Nile Virus or something less than today's 
experiences. <br/>   <br/>Love,  Your cold, injured 
Dad.<br/><br/></body></html>

Will they still be in good humor when they realize you posted their <br/>
story for all 746 of us to share not to mention I just printed it to <br/>
pass around as I found it a CLASSIC!.  Thanks for starting my day <br/>
with a chuckle hope the wounds heal fine. If they can find a box in <br/>
those conditions they can find a  box any  normal day with ease! Do <br/>
they have normal days?    Leader of the Pack<br/>
