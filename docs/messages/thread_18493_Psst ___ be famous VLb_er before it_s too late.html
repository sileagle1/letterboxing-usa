                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Off-Season Virtual Letterbox series hosted by Team Bindlestiff, <br/>
will undergo a few changes at the end of April.<br/>
<br/>
It's no longer the "off season" for us sailing types, so I haven't<br/>
the time nor reliable access to the Internet for keeping up the<br/>
Honor Roll additions.<br/>
<br/>
Basically the whole Virtual Letterbox series will go to a simple<br/>
system of "On-Your-Honor"<br/>
<br/>
The HONOR ROLLS will continue to be added to and updated but only<br/>
until the end of April. The Honor Roll files will remain in place<br/>
on our Yahoogroups site though  so if you want a smidgen of fame, <br/>
solve some of the VLb's and get your name added before it's too <br/>
late. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link directly to the message, which has further details.  <br/>
(Note: You'll need to be signed it to yahoo for the link to work.) <br/>

<br/>
The clues to all our boxes are listed in the files area, including <br/>
the virtual series.<br/>
<br/>
The Honor Rolls currently show that there have been 24 who have <br/>
solved the first VLb and 9 participants who have completed the <br/>
entire series of ten boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Other notables are Grandvilla, who has completed VLb's through #7<br/>
<br/>
The Engraver and Mama Stork who have done the first six VLb's<br/>
<br/>
And halfway through the series (but not in sequential order) are <br/>
Ewok and Doublesaj <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
