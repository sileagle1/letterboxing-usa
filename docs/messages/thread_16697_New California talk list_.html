                    <div class="plaintext-content">Seeing as the Pacific Northwest talk list I created last March has <br/>
generally been well-received and now boasts of over 100 members and <br/>
over 2400 posts, I figured it was about time to expand it to <br/>
California.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and isn't everyone not in the Pacific Northwest glad they didn't <br/>
have to wade through all those 2400 posts?  =)<br/>
<br/>
But, I digress....  For California letterboxers--whether resident or <br/>
visitor--come on over to the new California talk list where you can <br/>
talk about all those Connecticut boxers.  ;o)  (I'm kidding, folks.  <br/>
There's bound to be 'spies' that join, so you should watch what you <br/>
say about anyone--even if they probably aren't on the board.)<br/>
