                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also visited the I-95 boxes over the holdiay weekend, and made a side trip to the Concord Point Lighthouse box.  What a wonderful diversion from the drudgery of the trip!  It only took us 10 minutes from the highway to get there, but it was so nice we ended up staying an hour...Dad Frog sat on a bench and fed the baby while Big Brother and Mama walked out on the dock and learned all about John O'Neill and his fight against the British in 1813.  I highly recommend this one to everyone on your next trip!  (Thanks, Music Woman!)<br/>

Chesapeake House Rest Areas. They are both fine and receiving visitors.<br/>

Thanks for a great diversion from our usual "pee and go" mentality!<br/>
