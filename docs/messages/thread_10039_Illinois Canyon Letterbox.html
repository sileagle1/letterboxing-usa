Closest town: Utica<br/>
County: LaSalle<br/>
State: Illinois<br/>
Planted by: Buffy &amp; John<br/>

Because the western end of Starved Rock seems to get so much more attention <br/>
than the eastern half, we decided to hide a letterbox in one of our favorite <br/>
areas of the park. This is an easy, quiet hike everyone can enjoy. But, <br/>
there is a disclaimer with this area. Although we haven't seen the "mostly" <br/>
dry creek bed filled with water in a long time, I know that during a wet <br/>
season, it could be, so be careful not to get your feet wet! They have <br/>
constructed some stepping stones for the more daring souls. We left there <br/>
once with wet shoes, but as of 1-3-03, it was dry!<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
Take a stroll to the end of the canyon and find the most distinctive "V" <br/>
which is only half of thee and search between the fallen three.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
