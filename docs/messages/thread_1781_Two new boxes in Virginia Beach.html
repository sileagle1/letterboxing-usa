<br/>
For both of these boxes, start at the main entrance to the park.<br/>
<br/>
The names of these two boxes are mathematical curves. You will<br/>
have to bear with us until we can carve cool nature shots <br/>
like the rest of you! Nevertheless we think they're cool names.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Ovals of Cassini<br/>
<br/>
Take the trail named for the American Olive clockwise. <br/>
After a while you'll come to a <br/>
tall (~20') tree stump in the middle of the trail, wider<br/>
 at the top than at the bottom. To the right of <br/>
the trail there is a large fallen log. Follow this <br/>
log all the way to its end, just beyond which lies <br/>
a largish tree. Ovals of Cassini is hidden <br/>
in debris just to the east of this tree. <br/>
<br/>
The Witch of Agnesi<br/>
<br/>
Continue along this trail. After passing over the<br/>
first wooden bridge, walk until you come to an <br/>
enormous cut tree to the right of the trail. "draw a line"<br/>
through this huge fallen log across to the left side of the path<br/>
to a pile of debris. The Witch of Agnesi lies beneath <br/>
the large log, near an "arrowhead" of the debris which points back <br/>
towards the original huge log. <br/>
