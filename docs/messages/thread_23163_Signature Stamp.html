                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first time I met anybody on the trail (The Northerner) he just <br/>
walked up to me and asked if I was letterboxing. Then he asked if I <br/>
had a personal stamp. I was still surprised by the encounter, and <br/>
just said "no." Not knowing how to respond to that, he left to look <br/>
for the box. <br/>
<br/>
After thinking about the situation for a minute, I went back to the <br/>
letterbox and asked him if he meant would I like to do an exchange, <br/>
and he did, so we did. He has a beautiful signature stamp. <br/>
<br/>
Since then, whenever I have asked to do an exchange, the other <br/>
letterboxer is often anxious to share their personal traveler (which <br/>
is often a much fancier design) but I am not capable of memorizing <br/>
the answers to everyone's personal stamp question on the off-chance <br/>
that I might run into them. <br/>
<br/>
Names of Celtic Quinn's three cats? I dunno. Can't remember. <br/>
<br/>
Lately I'm starting to do that finger-snapping thing when I can't <br/>
remember something, an annoying habit that I really should nip in the <br/>
bud, if I somehow remember to.  <br/>

I have met others that have more than one signature stamp and now i have 3. i have also noticed that more than one stamp can come in handy. One of my stamps is small for small logbooks, another is a solid one color for rainy/cold days, and my last stamp is multi colored for beautiful days. I have a personnal traveler that I do carry around with me, but never use cuz I haven't run across anyone on the trail since getting one. Which for those i will be meeting in April in Carlisle, may change. Not liking the one i have now.<br/>

<br/>
that the:<br/>
1. SIGNATURE STAMP is the stamp you stamp in the logboks in the  <br/>
letterboxes you find.<br/>
2. PERSONAL STAMP is a stamp you use only for exchanges or stamping  <br/>
into YOUR OWN letterboxes when you plant it.<br/>
3. PERSONAL TRAVELLER is a letterbox you carry around and people have  <br/>
to ask you for it or answer a question.<br/>
<br/>
I believe I read somewhere that this is the "system" that is used in  <br/>
the UK. This way your identity as a letterboxer when you stamp into a  <br/>
letterbox is kept a "secret." Since you are stamping secretly with  <br/>
your SIGNATURE STAMP. It kind of adds a bit of mystery. . .  but I  <br/>
like the idea that people just get an extra stamp in their journals  <br/>
when you exchange. If you have planted a letterbox and the person you  <br/>
are exchanging with has done your letterbox than you already have  <br/>
their stamp somewhere. So now with this system described above, it  <br/>
kind of makes it more enjoyable to get an exchange since you most  <br/>
likely do not have the exchange stamp (the personal stamp).<br/>
<br/>
boy.  does that make any sense?<br/>
<br/>
I myself have this system (if you couldn't guess by now) but I don't  <br/>
think it's a big deal for me if people know my signature stamp, but I  <br/>
admit I don't go and give this information out readily. Remember that  <br/>
mysterious "purple-stamp" that made it's way into many logbooks with  <br/>
no indication of who or where it was from? It wasn't me, but wasn't  <br/>
that kind of intriguing? Another fun level to letterboxing.<br/>

Not correct -- a personal and signature stamp are the same thing, <br/>
your own stamp that you use to stamp into letterboxes that you find <br/>
or exchange with other letterboxers whom you happen to meet.<br/>
<br/>
A personal traveller is a letterbox that travels with your person.<br/>

<br/>
Sorta, but not quite. They do things a bit differently in the UK, but <br/>
they don't carry around three stamps for three different purposes.<br/>

I don't know . . .<br/>
<br/>
I think I like the mystery part of it. Not the anonymity. Anonymity  <br/>
implies, to me, that one has something to hide. I don't . . . unless  <br/>
you want to count that one incident at the Birthday Letterboxing  <br/>
Event where I misinterpreted the birthday part and arrived nude. . .  <br/>
well now thats no good . . . now everybody knows. . . you see, I have  <br/>
nothing to hide.<br/>
<br/>
Was the Purple Skull intriguing, or just plain annoying to people? I  <br/>
thought it was a great little mystery and we all were talking about  <br/>
it trying to gather our "clues" to figure out who it could be. maybe  <br/>
I was the only one who thought it was interesting. . . mind you I had  <br/>
decided to have Team Randalstik as a Personal stamp prior to knowing  <br/>
about the purple skull.<br/>

&gt;&gt; So I've had the same signature stamp since I started letterboxing. <br/>
&gt;&gt; Since then my carving skills have improved. I'd like to make a new one. <br/>
&gt;&gt; Are there any "rules" for doing this? And what should I do with the old <br/>
&gt;&gt; stamp?<br/>
&gt;&gt; Any suggestions are welcome!<br/>
&gt;&gt; Thanks!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;     <br/>
&gt; For the love of generic tupperware! Rules? Beyond common courtesy there are no rules.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>

Agreed.  Seems far too many people are far too worried about rules that <br/>
don't exist.  Do what you will so long as you are willing to suffer the <br/>
consequences, that is my stand.  If you want to carve a new sig stamp, <br/>
go for it, and do what you want to do.  Don't worry about what others <br/>
might think about it, just be prepared for everyone and their mother <br/>
wanting a fresh exchange at the next gathering you go to ;-)<br/>
