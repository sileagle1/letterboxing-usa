Although I couldn't make it to last year's Midwest gathering and it was<br/>
uncharacteristically cold, I think having it on Memorial Day weekend is a<br/>
good idea.  I had been considering suggesting a Midwest gathering myself,<br/>
and had already considered a number of ideas.  Since last year's gathering<br/>
was in MI, I would suggest someplace other than MI this time.  I would<br/>
suggest the IL State Park in Zion, IL just north of Chicago where Matt the<br/>
Rat's Dead River box is.  It is a large state park with many camping sites,<br/>
and entry to the park is free (unlike in WI and MI).<br/>

I'd also be willing to do some event boxes/stamps.<br/>

I've already emailed Enders Angel offline that I think the idea of a <br/>
Midwest gathering sounds great. Memorial weekend would be a good <br/>
weekend for me.  I'd come from Minnesota and I know of several others <br/>
from here who'd probably come as well. Illinois is closer to us and <br/>
would be great but, I'd come to other locations within a days driving <br/>
distance, such as Michigan. I'm willing to help out in any way I can.<br/>
