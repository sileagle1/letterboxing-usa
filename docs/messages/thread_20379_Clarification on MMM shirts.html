                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would like to clear up a misconception about the Mansfield Monster Mash T shirts, sweat shirts, and the walking sticks. This is a personal business of Momma Fox and Bald Eagle. It is not an actual part of the Mansfield Monster Mash. Momma Fox did make the MMM event stamp and both her and Bald Eagle have been very helpful to us. She asked permission to sell T shirts, sweat shirts and walking sticks at the event with the event stamp logo and they do have our permission but it is entirely her business and all proceeds go to her. The hosts and other volunteers have nothing to do with it. Any questions about purchasing these items should be addressed to her. .....Chuck and Molly<br/>
