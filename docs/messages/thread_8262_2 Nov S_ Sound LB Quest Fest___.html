<br/>
Don't forget to clear your calendar for the upcoming: <br/>
<br/>
~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
1st Annual South Sound Letterbox Quest Fest!!!<br/>
<br/>
When:  Saturday, 2 Nov 02<br/>
<br/>
Time:  10am--until COB that is, when you've found the boxes you want <br/>
and you've exchanged the personal stamps that you want!!!  Formal <br/>
festivities will kick off at 12pm noon!!!<br/>
<br/>
Location:  Model Boating Picnic Table by the lake at<br/>
<br/>
Ft Steilacoom Park, Lakewood, WA (just south of Tacoma)<br/>
http://www.ci.lakewood.wa.us/parks.html<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~*~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From I-5 North &amp; South:  To get to Fort Steilacoom Park <br/>
from Interstate 5, take Exit 125 toward Lakewood. Turn left on <br/>
Steilacoom Boulevard. The fort is located near the entrance to <br/>
Western State Hospital at 9601 Steilacoom Blvd. S.W.  Fort <br/>
Steilacoom Park is directly across the street from the fort.  Turn <br/>
left on 87th Ave SW,  right on Dresden Lane SW.  Follow the road <br/>
past the sports fields.  You will eventually see some old, red barns <br/>
in front of and to your right.  Look for the parking lot behind (&amp; <br/>
left of) Barn #2. <br/>
Maps &amp; other Directions:  http://www.csr69.com/kites/maps/f_stil.htm<br/>
<br/>
LETTERBOXES:  We'll need help from all you South Sound folks in <br/>
planting additional boxes in the park prior to the event.  Please <br/>
bring your clues for the new letterboxes to the event with you (10 <br/>
copies would be great to hand out to the other letterboxes that show <br/>
up that day).  Otherwise, you may post your clues to the message <br/>
board a few days prior to that.  Don't forget---Hitchhiker LBs are <br/>
more than welcome, too!<br/>
<br/>
Event Stamp?  Would any artful types like to donate their talents in <br/>
creating an event stamp?  I would, but you wouldn't like my stamp--<br/>
let's say 'poorly carved' would only be a compliment for what I <br/>
could create!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Food:  No Frills Potluck.  We will eat between 10am and 12pm noon.  <br/>
Please ensure that you bring enough food and plates/utensils/drinks, <br/>
etc. to cover the number of folks within your group.<br/>
<br/>
Restrooms:  available at the park.<br/>
<br/>
Am I forgetting anything?  Please let me know if you see any glaring <br/>
oversights!!!  (I'll be out of town for a week but will be back in <br/>
full gear on 17 Oct so don't be alarmed if you don't hear from me <br/>
for a few days).<br/>
<br/>
THEMES FOR POSSIBLE BOXES AT THIS PARK:  Ft Steilacoom Park is a <br/>
270+ acre park that already has 2 letterboxes within its <br/>
boundaries.  These 2 LBs depict the Insane Asylum and Heath Farm <br/>
that once stood on the grounds.  There are several athletic fields, <br/>
playground, barns with silo, cemetery, historical markers, lake, old <br/>
decrepit buildings and storage structures, walking trails, large <br/>
trees, berry brambles, Fort Steilacoom <br/>
http://home1.gte.net/5white/fort_history.html and Western WA State <br/>
Hospital are directly across the street.  There is a lot of VERY <br/>
INTERESTING history associated with the area including <br/>
outlaw/vigilante altercations/hangings, shootouts, the 1st <br/>
Historical Highway (Byrn Mill Road) in the state ran through the <br/>
area, you name it.  Pierce County College's campus borders one side <br/>
of the park, too.  On clear days there are views of Mt Rainier.  <br/>
There are model boating competitions in the lake, running/bike races <br/>
in the park, etc.  Chambers Creek flows from this area and drains <br/>
into the Puget Sound about 2 miles from here. You are only limited <br/>
by your imagination!!! <br/>
<br/>
HOPE TO SEE YOU ALL THEN &amp; BRING YOUR FRIENDS!!!!!<br/>

Only thing I can think of that you missed is digital cameras so other <br/>

Themes?  I have a couple in mind.  Gotta get the kids carving right <br/>
away.<br/>

     We welcome your generosity and look forward to your stamp!  We <br/>
promise to be exceptionally nice!!!  Come on, by now, you've <br/>
probably seen some of my stamps in this neck of the woods...  ;)<br/>
