Sadly all the rain managed to do some damage to the Garland letterbox #2<br/>
which I went to check today--it was 1/2 full of water turned a bloody red<br/>
from the saturated, floating stamp pad.  (Guess I should have hurried up<br/>
with those ziplock bags we talked about, huh Sheila???)  Stuff is drying<br/>
out and I should have it back out there sometime this week.  Box #1 was in<br/>
fine shape, but needs more people to find it!<br/>

:-D  For a minute there I thought you were turning water into wine or<br/>
something.  A good sign that letterboxing is a very good thing indeed? <br/>

&gt;I read later that it's all dried out and back in place, so congrats again!<br/>
&gt;I'm wondering if you would share, (if you didn't already and I missed it),<br/>
&gt;what kind of container you were using, and if you switched containers<br/>
&gt;for your replacement?<br/>
<br/>
Hi Deborah--<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your well wishes--<br/>
<br/>
I didn't switch containers (Rubbermaid)--it wasn't the container's fault it<br/>
flooded, but mine.  I was careless when I put a heavy rock on top of it to<br/>
hide it and didn't notice that the seal had broken...so, needless to say, I<br/>
was much more careful this time!  And stuff inside is in plastic baggies to<br/>
keep it dry if the disaster should try to repeat itself.<br/>
