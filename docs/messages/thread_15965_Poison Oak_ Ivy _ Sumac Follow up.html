<br/>
I finally found a tube of Zanfel at my local Rite Aid.  I was <br/>
forewarned that it was expensive--it was $39.99 a tube BUT IF IT <br/>
WORKS (&amp; I trust Paul Harvey) IT WILL BE SOOOOOO WORTH IT!  I might <br/>
even attempt the Angel's Rest LB in Oregon one day--armed with this <br/>
in my treasure chest!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Greetings fellow letterboxers &amp; poison ivy, oak &amp; sumac allergic <br/>

&gt; &gt; ZANFEL, ZANFEL, ZANFEL...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;      I suffer the similar plight of being highly allergic to <br/>
&gt; poison <br/>
&gt; &gt; oak, ivy &amp; sumac--most cases require prescriptions of prednisone <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; bid it farewell!  I recently heard about a product called Zanfel <br/>
&gt; &gt; that is supposed to work immediately on cases of poison oak, ivy <br/>
&amp; <br/>
&gt; &gt; sumac (even on the rash regardless of what stage of 'ooze' it is <br/>
&gt; in--<br/>
&gt; &gt; pardon me for the gory details but that's usually the normal <br/>
chain <br/>
&gt; &gt; of events for any &amp; all cases I get of this stuff).  <br/>
&gt; &gt;      My sister (non-letterboxing one) in Northern California who <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; similarly 'nuclear' reactive to this stuff heard about it <br/>
recently <br/>
&gt; &gt; from, of all places, Paul Harvey, and immediately made it her <br/>
&gt; &gt; mission in life to find it &amp; try it.  Soon thereafter, she came <br/>
&gt; home <br/>
&gt; &gt; with another case of poison oak and now she swears by Zanfel!!!  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; think she said she found it at Rite Aid but it should also be <br/>
&gt; &gt; available at those other drugstore chains, too.  I think, <br/>
however, <br/>
&gt; &gt; it may run quite expensive, though.  But personally speaking, <br/>
I'm <br/>
&gt; &gt; willing to spend $60 a tube for anything that will rid me of <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; torture!!!  And that says a lot coming from an EXTREMELY frugal <br/>
&gt; &gt; person....<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope this renders some comfort to other letterboxers out there...<br/>
