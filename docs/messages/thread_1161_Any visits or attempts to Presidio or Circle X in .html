I will be checking on the Presidio boxes in November<br/>
( I have a day off in the bay area.)<br/>
But I heard some other people tried them and could not find them.<br/>
Bummer, I was looking forward to those.<br/>
I will place another when I get there.<br/>

&gt;I placed these 3 boxes on business trips and it is diificult for me<br/>
&gt;to check them regularly since I live in PA.  Has anyone attempted to<br/>
&gt;find or found the Circle X box in the Santa Monicas or the 2 boxes in<br/>
&gt;the Presidio area in San Francisco?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I've not yet received confirmation that anyone has found any of these<br/>
&gt;boxes.<br/>

<br/>
I sent my message before reading this one.... so you know at least one of<br/>
the Presidio boxes is there.  Oh and I forgot to mention that I told<br/>
everyone at Wham-O and Wild Planet (my clients) about letterboxing (some of<br/>
which were very interested), so you can probably expect there to be more<br/>
activity in the SF area sometime soon.<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about trying for the Circle X box (again) but thought<br/>
that I would wait until the wheather cools off.  When I do I'll let you<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Life is Good,  Wendy<br/>
