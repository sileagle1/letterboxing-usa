but John says we have to go to the beach and pick up a grandkid, plus we<br/>
have a family event on Sunday.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven't been there since last year, so things may have changed.  But<br/>
that row of bushes was kind of parallel to the museum (more or less) on<br/>
the Southwest side of the grounds.  Same side as the restrooms.  I hate<br/>
to think this box has come up missing.  The stamp I carved for it is one<br/>
of my favorites that I've placed.<br/>
<br/>
Did you get Horsethief Lake, Arlen?  That's a fun one, too, I think.<br/>
<br/>
