                    <div class="plaintext-content">A slow day at work this week gave me the chance to visit Crump Park <br/>
which is the site of historic Meadow Farm.  The farm is one of the <br/>
last remaining 19th-century farms where today a museum and farmhouse <br/>
offer glimpses into the past.<br/>
<br/>
Meadow Farm is 12 miles north of downtown Richmond.  Take I-95, exit <br/>
84 to I-295 west.  Take the Woodman Road South exit to Mountain <br/>
Road.  Turn right.  Follow the signs on Mountain Road.<br/>
<br/>
The Meadow Farm Letterbox is on a short easy trail in the woods on <br/>
the farmland.  Park in the museum parking lot and follow the paved <br/>
path towards the farmhouse.  At the red brick path leading to the <br/>
house, go left towards the horse corral.  Pass the blacksmith forge <br/>
to the hiking sign.  Follow path passing the sheep to enter the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Cross the first footbridge and go straight, which takes you onto the <br/>
trail at the back end of the loop, over one more foot bridge.  The <br/>
loop is short and it's hard to ignore the sound of the traffic so <br/>
closeby.  The birds and scampering squirrels do try to compete and <br/>
add a little atmosphere to the walk.  Follow trail left passed sign <br/>
post 14.  Pine needles and fallen leaves at some points camouflage <br/>
the trail, but if you pause and take a good look, the way is apparent.<br/>
<br/>
At signpost 10, you're practically in the backyards of the <br/>
neighboring houses, something I'm sure no Civil War soldier could <br/>
ever imagine as he travelled through these woods.<br/>
<br/>
Crossing the 3rd footbridge over the creek, you'll be winding back <br/>
towards the farmhouse.  At signpost 4, leave the trail to the left <br/>
and walk towards the segment of fence at the edge of the wood.<br/>
<br/>
The Meadow Farm letterbox is behind the fence posts lying on the <br/>
ground.  Recover with leaves and piece of log keeping it from view.<br/>
<br/>
Finding the letterbox won't take long, and if the museum and <br/>
farmhouse are closed, the grounds are nice to explore.  The animals <br/>
are usually out, and you may even see the cow who posed for the <br/>
Meadow Farm stamp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and be safe,<br/>
