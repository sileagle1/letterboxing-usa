                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for clarifying!  I certainly appreciate it as my brain went off on vacation wondering possible scenerios of how this could happen and does happening on a box not being sought occur often.  I was in the middle of the definitation of poaching and wondering if that could apply here when your Mystery Box message came through.  Remarkably, or maybe not so unremarkably, that hadn't occured to me yet.  So thanks!  Eli had a great response too.  You guys all rock!<br/>

Multi colored stamping - markers like Marvey or Crayola (MLB PLBers help me out with this discussion we just had) will get it done.  Never fear!  Underdog is there!<br/>

I was thinking if someone accidentally found a mystery box and identified the location of a <br/>
regular letterbox nearby, that the placer might be sorry the general location's cover had <br/>
been identified.  Nothing more.  Perhaps I was too protective of Eli (sorry.) I hope to find <br/>
some letterboxes like that!<br/>
