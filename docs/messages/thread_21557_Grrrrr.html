Bah! One of my letterboxes I just placed maybe a week ago was found <br/>
by a geocacher for the first find. No geo cache nearby, but he said <br/>
a pile of rocks caught his eye and he found my box. So me thinks I <br/>
need to go rehide it. The challenging part is that it is a mystery <br/>
box and you have to break a code to get the clues, now I have to <br/>
rewrite the code. Grrr.<br/>
At least he was a respectful geocacher, he said he signed in, put <br/>
everything back the way it was and it is still in good shape.<br/>

probaly means that he wants your location for one of his caches, <br/>
remember geocachers look for the same things we do.  you just got <br/>
there first.  Your spot was muggled only because we think alike<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I've stumbled upon dozens of geocaches while letterboxing in the <br/>
&gt; very same manner.  After immersing myself in letterboxing and <br/>
&gt; dabbling in geocaching awhile, you get trained to study the <br/>
&gt; surroundings.  Anything that remotely looks 'out of the ordinary' I <br/>
&gt; typically investigate.  Sometimes I find a geocache, other times a <br/>
&gt; letterbox and more often than not, unfortunately, just 'gross <br/>
&gt; stuff'.  Usually it's the tell-tale letterbox/geocache stick or <br/>
&gt; rock 'altar' built to camouflage a box that piques my curiosity.  <br/>
&gt; Sometimes it's the bit of container that peaks out from behind the <br/>
&gt; camouflage.  Othertimes, it's a pronounced 'social' trail that's <br/>
&gt; developed to an area that otherwise wouldn't have a trail.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I doubt what happened here is a vindictive or 'territorial' thing--<br/>
&gt; just curiousity that led one to investigate the rocks and what the <br/>
&gt; rocks were 'protecting' which, in turn, led to the letterbox <br/>
&gt; discovery.  He probably recommended re-hiding it in a better spot <br/>
&gt; thinking that it was too 'exposed' to survive its original hiding <br/>
&gt; spot.  Geocaching is a very popular and well-known hobby (especially <br/>
&gt; in the US) and you'd be amazed the number of visitors most geocaches <br/>
&gt; have on a daily/weekly basis compared to letterboxes in a given year <br/>
&gt; (unless, of course, you're in the boxopolis of CT).  For example in <br/>
&gt; my region (Seattle/Tacoma/Olympia megalopolis), my letterboxes <br/>
&gt; usually get about a dozen visitors a year--some of the neighboring <br/>
&gt; geocaches get a dozen visitors a day, increasing exponentially when <br/>
&gt; the geocache listing first debuts on the website as there's <br/>
&gt; typically extra incentive &amp; desire to earn 'First to Find' credit in <br/>
&gt; geocaching.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Geocaching is a neat sport, sort of a modern twist on letterboxing, <br/>
&gt; it's just a bit different from letterboxing and more 'popular' on a <br/>
&gt; numbers level.  As a letterbox planter, it's a good idea to check <br/>
&gt; out the geocaches already located in a particular area in which <br/>
&gt; you're considering planting a letterbox--if not only to coordinate <br/>
&gt; it with the other geocache planters (which I really haven't <br/>
&gt; personally done but might be a neat approach?) or just to know areas <br/>
&gt; to avoid to reduce the chance of your letterbox being accidentally <br/>
&gt; discovered (&amp; possibly relocated) by a geocacher who isn't versed on <br/>
&gt; letterboxing and where the letterbox is 'supposed' to be located as <br/>
&gt; described in the clues.  Specific hiding spots in geocaching aren't <br/>
&gt; always as important in geocaching as they are to letterboxing as the <br/>
&gt; letterboxing clues often are quite specific in where the boxes are <br/>
&gt; hidden.<br/>

No, it's obvious only to a letterboxer or geo-cacher.  I found a geo-<br/>
cache while hunting for a place to hide a letterbox.  We tend to <br/>
look for the same sorts of hiding places.  People who aren't GCers <br/>
or LBers walk past the spot literally a hundred times a day.  It's <br/>
less than 10' from the sidewalk, and it's been there for months.  <br/>
Unless there's a problem, leave your box where it is.<br/>
