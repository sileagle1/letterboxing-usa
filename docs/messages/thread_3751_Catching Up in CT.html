                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings, fellow 'boxers --<br/>
<br/>
Time to report in after a brief absence from the Letterboxing discussion <br/>
list. In between fall cleanup (all those leaves!) and the increasingly <br/>
shorter days, finding enough time to search for those last precious <br/>
letterboxes before winter rolls around can become more and more difficult. <br/>
Luckily, the weather here in Connecticut recently has been most conducive to <br/>
a few rounds of late-season letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
About two weeks ago, my buddy David (a/k/a Sugarmaker) and I each took a <br/>
well-deserved day off from work and trekked down to Killingworth where, after <br/>
stamping in at the Blue Bird letterbox and partaking of the excellent muffins <br/>
close by, we spent the better part of the day at Chatfield Hollow State Park <br/>
looking for - and finding - the series of six letterboxes planted by Bill and <br/>
Val of Letterboxing Central.  If you go (and I highly recommend it!), one <br/>
word of advice: The clues for each box begin at a different location within <br/>
the park, and the clues suggest that you drive to each new starting point. <br/>
However, the main entrance to the park has been gated for the season and, as <br/>
a result, you cannot access the interior park road (there is a parking lot <br/>
just outside the main entrance). As such, you should be prepared to do some <br/>
additional hiking in order to get from the end of one hike to the beginning <br/>
of another. <br/>
<br/>
More recently, ESAK's series of three letterboxes at Timberlin Park in Berlin <br/>
provided another of my favorite hikes in a while. The climbs and descents are <br/>
exciting, the clues are a little tricky in places (I tripped myself up a <br/>
couple of times!), the boxes are well-hidden and the stamps are beautifully <br/>
carved. That said, I hope that Elmer will allow me one minor criticism: the <br/>
trail blazes that he describes as yellow are lime green! Don't take just my <br/>
word for it...the half dozen or so 'boxers who preceded me to the first <br/>
letterbox made the same observation in the box's logbook! C'mon, Elmer, time <br/>
to 'fess up and revise that clue! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I was not surprised to see that Pete and Wanda were first to find ESAK's <br/>
Timberlin Park letterboxes. Which got me to thinking: has anyone else besides <br/>
me come to believe that there must be a number of "Pete and Wanda" clones <br/>
combing this part of the Letterboxing Realm in search of every new letterbox? <br/>
How else to explain the fact that this wily couple is almost always the first <br/>
pair of 'boxers to triumphantly find and stamp in to every new letterbox <br/>
within a 100-mile radius of their home? Or perhaps there are "Pete and Wanda" <br/>
impersonators among us who, having surreptitously counterfitted this duo's <br/>
signature stamps, now go about the countryside pretending to be Pete and <br/>
Wanda upon first finding a new box. What exactly is going on here?<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, a report on two hitchhikers, one found and one sent on its way. The <br/>
"World's Smallest Hitchhiker" turned up this past Saturday and now occupies <br/>
an extremely tiny space in my backpack until Thanksgiving. when he (she? it?) <br/>
will be heading for colder climes. On the other hand, the "Post-Doc" <br/>
Hitchhiker has just found a new home and is resting comfortably for the <br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great Thanksgiving, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
Alan from Axtown<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Regarding Alan's rumors of "Wanda and Pete impersonators" (aka "WPI <br/>
clones"), we must admit that, although Pete did, indeed, graduate many <br/>
years ago from WPI with a degree in engineering, it was NOT in GENETICS <br/>
engineering [ :-) ]!  What seems to have happened here is that, last <br/>
winter, when we finally figured out what letterboxing was all about, we <br/>
began a veritable "feeding frenzy" that had us relentlessly searching, <br/>
even through piles of snow and ice, to gobble up every available <br/>
letterbox on the local "buffet lines"!<br/>
<br/>
After several months of sampling everything on the area menus, we found <br/>
that we'd really developed quite an APPETITE and couldn't wait to savor <br/>
each tasty new morsel as it appeared on the table!  Not that we had to <br/>
be first in line, mind you (and we certainly would never have been so <br/>
`gauche' as to actually say so [ ;-) ]!), but we were HUNGRY!  So now <br/>
is another great time to give thanks to everyone who has provided all <br/>
these treats, and to wish you all a Happy Thanksgiving, and BJ please <br/>
pass the gravy.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the Banquet,<br/>
<br/>
Wanda and Pete<br/>
<br/>
PS:  We are now starting to travel a little farther afield to get some <br/>
of those special delicacies, too!  We just had a marvelous minivacation <br/>
in Maine where we feasted on a few delicious gourmet tidbits from Tom <br/>
Cooch, `legerdemaine', and RIBNAG.  Then Wanda went up for a short trip <br/>
to VT, where she finished up the rest of the Valley Quest series, <br/>
helped put in a new box ("George Knox") for the updated Valley Quest <br/>
book (which should be out next year), and then nabbed her 700th <br/>
letterbox at the Braintree Panther!  We are however trying to slow down <br/>
the pace a bit to savor the individual flavors!<br/>
<br/>
Mark o' the Fittons:  Just saw your message and wish to report that <br/>
Wanda is very real (see our picture among Winter Gathering photos at <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/gathering/gathering.htm );  she was <br/>
just off hiking her 5th AT at the time you met Pete.  As for the <br/>
Thanksgiving meal offer, sounds great but we are actually passing up <br/>
Thanksgiving dinner to go letterboxing on Turkey Mountain!<br/>
<br/>
Debbie:  put out your boxes and we will come!<br/>
