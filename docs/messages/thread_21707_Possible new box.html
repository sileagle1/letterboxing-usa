Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of doing a new box to commemorate the life of our dear <br/>
cat Fluffy.  We have had her for 8 years.  Yesterday morning as my 3 <br/>
year old and I were leaving to go to mother's day out I ran over her.  <br/>
I am so very distraught over the whole incident, especially with my <br/>
husband being out of town on business.  My little boy saw her as she <br/>
was dying and hopefully he is resillent as I think he is.  This cat <br/>
slept with him every night and he used her as a pillow.  Anyway if <br/>
anyone is interested in receiving this type of letterbox please email <br/>
me.  I could also use any words of advice or encouragement that you can <br/>
offer.<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My daughter seems to suffer extraordinary events every time her husband is  <br/>
out of town - everything from a 4-year old falling and knocking out both front  <br/>
teeth to a 1-year old suffering a severe peanut allergy reaction and the  <br/>
paramedics being called, to all kinds of lesser cuts scrapes, and minor  <br/>
emregency-room visits, dead car batteries, you name it - always when the husband  is <br/>
gone.  (How do they DO that?)  She is an expert on coping and  handling it - I <br/>
don't know how (there are 3 children, oldest is 7, a big Lab, 2  cats, and <br/>
assorted other critters including a turtle and 2 fish in the  household, and she <br/>
teaches Kindergarten - my, I'm exhausted just considering it  all!)  All of <br/>
that to say, I'm sorry to hear about Fluffy - losing a pet,  especially that <br/>
way, is so sad.  I took my beloved beagle Pogo for a walk  one snowy, icy day and <br/>
stood there in shock as a car rolled right over him,  unable to stop on the <br/>
slick ice, and I still remember it vividly years  later.  Yes, the LB is a <br/>
great idea as a memorial.  You plant it and  I'll find it.  (But could you maybe <br/>
plant it somewhere closer to  DFW?)  <br/>

Another thought - "The 10th Good Thing About Barney" by Judith Viorst is  <br/>
about a little boy whose cat has died and his mother tells him to think of 10  <br/>
good things to say about him as they bury him.  Maybe you could find it at  a <br/>
library or bookstore - been around a long time.  <br/>

Sorry to hear about your cat. I would suggest the childrens book CAT<br/>
HEAVEN by Cynthia Rylant. I have DOG HEAVEN which I read to my son<br/>
when I need to think about my departed best friend. <br/>
