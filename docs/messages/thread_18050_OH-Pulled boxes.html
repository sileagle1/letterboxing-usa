Recently Team HowlingCrow has had to pull two of our boxes for <br/>
maintenance and we also moved one box to ease traffic on its <br/>
surroundings.  The pulled boxes are:  "Lock 18" and "Good Cheer!".  <br/>
The box we moved is "True Blue 'Marsh'ian".  "True Blue" is in the <br/>
same park with different clues.  The clue change is posted to our <br/>
webpage as well as the LBNA list.  Thanks to everyone who stamped in <br/>
to our boxes; this is an excellent thing we're doing!!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and Happy Stamping!!<br/>
