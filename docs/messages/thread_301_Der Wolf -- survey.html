&gt; PS:  Really like the survey feature, although it removes some<br/>
&gt; of the discussion.  Thanks, Mitch.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate the feedback, Wolfie!  Just want to point out<br/>
that I don't intend for the poll to be a definitive end to the<br/>
discussion.  At best, I'm hoping it can serve as a guideline.<br/>
All the ideas that have been suggested have merit, and it<br/>
seemed to me we could spend weeks praising and critiquing<br/>
each idea without ever coming close to a group concensus.<br/>
<br/>
I just thought that conducting a survey like this might help<br/>
us decide which ideas were worth fleshing out.  There's no<br/>
sense in wasting our time pondering the feasibility of a<br/>
particular concept if the majority of group members don't <br/>
care for it. Once we've narrowed down the choices, maybe we<br/>
can devote some effort to working out the particulars.<br/>
<br/>
You'll note I worded the last option on the poll to suggest<br/>
that rather than outright copy the stamps of the pioneer<br/>
letterboxes, we could optionally do original tribute stamps<br/>
commemorating the placement of the first box in a state.<br/>
This way, the design of the original stamp could remain a<br/>
secret.  These are the types of details we can concentrate on<br/>
after we've determined whether or not people like the idea<br/>
in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, opinions associated with the poll and discussion<br/>
of the early results is welcomed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your cooperation.<br/>
