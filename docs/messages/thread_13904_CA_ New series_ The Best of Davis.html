 THE BEST OF DAVIS LETTERBOX SERIES<br/>
<br/>
This quest will net you 4 letterboxes only if you do your homework before you <br/>
start and are precise in deciphering the clues. The first part will be <br/>
predominantly in your car and the second part is a good mile on foot (or bike) along <br/>
a flat, paved, dog-on-leash-friendly path. About ¾ to 1 hour is needed once <br/>
you begin but you can easily add an hour if you stop to eat fabulous burgers, <br/>
peruse the bookshelves or play. <br/>
<br/>
To the letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
Box #1<br/>
The best burger between Sacramento and the Bay Area was made at Murder Burger <br/>
in Davis, Calif. By popular demand of the notoriously humane Davisites, <br/>
Murder Burger is no more, but also still here and somehow turned around. Find this <br/>
burger place to start your search. It’s best to be hungry when you arrive as it<br/>
’s still the best burger around.<br/>
<br/>
The second letter in the name of this establishment is the street you are <br/>
looking for next in downtown Davis. Go north-west and find a book store on this <br/>
street that Sam Spade would frequent. (“Here’s looking at you kid”) You might <br/>
want to park your car and spend a little time on foot as this is one of many <br/>
great book stores in town. I’m Scottish (cheap) so I love used book stores like <br/>
this one. <br/>

&gt; along <br/>

&gt; this <br/>

&gt; it<br/>
&gt; s still the best burger around.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The second letter in the name of this establishment is the street you are<br/>
&gt; looking for next in downtown Davis. Go north-west and find a book store on<br/>
&gt; this <br/>
&gt; street that Sam Spade would frequent. (Heres looking at you kid) You might<br/>
&gt; want to park your car and spend a little time on foot as this is one of many<br/>
&gt; great book stores in town. Im Scottish (cheap) so I love used book stores<br/>
&gt; like <br/>
&gt; this one. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;From this store go 8 doors south. Be careful to count ALL of the doors. This<br/>
&gt; name of the establishment behind this door is the theme of the treasure you<br/>
&gt; seek. Memorizing it will help you later to find your ultimate goal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Get back in your car and go north 2 12 blocks then go east 0.8 miles. Turn<br/>
&gt; north following a prominent Pole Line. Traveling a ways through a residential<br/>
&gt; neighborhood, youre looking next for a nugget with fine greens. Its past<br/>
&gt; Carl<br/>
&gt; s and Picasso (no, you havent gone too far!) and is the theme park that is<br/>
&gt; the home of the sought treasure.<br/>
&gt; Turn east at this park and enter the 2nd driveway on your right. Park at the<br/>
&gt; far end.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Note: On occasion, this park is filled with hundreds of people which will<br/>
&gt; make your job of being discreet quite difficult but not impossible. Just be<br/>
&gt; careful and be sure to rehide the boxes well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now: How many LETTERS were in the name of the theme store you found back<br/>
&gt; in downtown Davis? Multiply this number by 12. From the end of this parking<br/>
&gt; area, go on a bearing of this number and find a lamp post. From here, go to<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; nearest fence post and you will find your goal hanging there!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box #2<br/>
&gt; Go to the nearest walking path and head SE. Youll see Leonardo on your left<br/>
&gt; give him a wave. This path passes the ends of several cul-de-sacs as you<br/>
&gt; meander through. Dont waste your time looking at the big rocks or the<br/>
&gt; parallel <br/>
&gt; barsyoure only 55 steps away from your next find! Walk that 55 paces to a<br/>
&gt; tree on the north side of the path. At the base of the tree is a low bush.<br/>
&gt; Look under the only rock under that bush to find box #2.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box #3<br/>
&gt; Continue on the path a ways, passing a drinking fountain, which is nearly<br/>
&gt; half way to the next box. The path bends in a southerly direction. Take a rest<br/>
&gt; where you see the symbol of Davis but againdont waste your time as the<br/>
&gt; Best of Davis #3 is behind you! Its in the bushes, under a rock near where 3<br/>
&gt; fences meet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box #4<br/>
&gt; Continue toward the traffic but dont cross the street. You want to head<br/>
&gt; west. Take the street named after the artist who painted Woman in a Purple<br/>
&gt; Coat<br/>
&gt; , travel a short distance on the street named after the artist who painted <br/>
&gt; Gabrielle and Clude then take a right on the street named after the Cubist<br/>
&gt; who <br/>
&gt; painted Cote dAzure. Find a path at 2037 and take it to the T. Go a<br/>
&gt; short distance north to E26. Eleven feet directly behind E26, under a rock<br/>
&gt; that is a little larger than all the rest, is box #4.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To get back to your car, follow the path in a northerly direction. Recognize<br/>
&gt; where you are? Good, then you can find your way back yourself!!<br/>

I decided to go with two 15 year old boys on this Letterbox hunt for an<br/>
adventurous afternoon. One boy my son, has done the UC Davis box<br/>
(absolutely the best of Davis and probably many others)and the other had<br/>
never heard of Letterboxing before.   We were sorely disappointed when we<br/>
turned up none of the four boxes.    The first letterbox was very confusing<br/>
once we got to the nugget.  It would seem easy but in the end we concluded<br/>
all the boxes were missing.   If you check and find we are wrong then you<br/>
might consider redoing your clues.<br/>
<br/>
