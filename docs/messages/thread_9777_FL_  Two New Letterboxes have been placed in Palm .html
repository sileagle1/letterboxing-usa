1.  Tiki Idol Letterbox: Find George Snow Park in Boca Raton.  Follow the <br/>
trail to the Serenoa Glade Preserve.  Go to information board.  Take the <br/>
concrete paved path to the left of the sign and follow in numerical order.  <br/>
Between location 6 and 7 there is a tree on your left with 5 main trunks.  <br/>
Look behind and under some debris and you will find that the "Gods Have <br/>
Spoken."<br/>
<br/>
2.  Florida Friends:  This letterbox is dedicated to all of the great <br/>
friends we have met along the way during our tenure in Florida--as the <br/>
Terrapin Traveliers are currently planning to relocate back to New <br/>
England--our point of origin.  Find Patch Reef Park in Boca Raton.  Park in <br/>
the lot that is between the soccer fields and the Pirates Cove Playground.  <br/>
Look for signs to the "Fit Trail."  Walk along the Fit Trail <br/>
path--Performing each of the routines at each station is optional!!  At <br/>
station number 9--(for the 9 years we have lived in Florida) face the sign <br/>
and look to the left and behind the sign. (220 degrees on compass)  At the <br/>
base of a saw palmetto, under a piece of tree stump you will find our <br/>
tribute.  Watch out for the thorn bushes!<br/>
