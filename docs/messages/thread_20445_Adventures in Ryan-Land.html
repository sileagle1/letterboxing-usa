                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is there any way to add to the frustration of one of Riskynil's 'Walking <br/>
Tour" Letterboxes? Oh, WE found one! Try finding a parking place in downtown <br/>
Boston!! There we were, on a Tuesday afternoon in mid-September (certainly, we <br/>
though, the tourists would all be gone) and there was not a one to be found in the <br/>
2 1/2 HOURS we tried to find this box!! <br/>
<br/>
OK, so plan B. Old Blue gets me close to the place we've decoded as the next <br/>
perplexing sign and I get out of the car, agreeing to spend a specified amount <br/>
of time solving the puzzle from the neck-breaking plaque on the side of an <br/>
historic point of interest. One-half hour later, I have the clue deciphered. On <br/>
to that location. <br/>
<br/>
This plaque's a little easier as it's short enough to actually write down <br/>
while sitting in the middle of the block in the car-until someone comes up from <br/>
behind and we have drive on, to muddle through the interminable one-way streets <br/>
to find that alley they call a street again! So, we've got it written down <br/>
and find a place to pull over to the curb-which is only permissible if we are <br/>
"residents" so we just pretend to be. Decipher, decipher. . . .of course, one <br/>
would have to spell Brittish with ONE "T" instead of 2 "Ts" to get the clue <br/>
exactly right, but, close enough.<br/>
<br/>
Our flight's in 2 hours, we still need to get gas (as we've idled away  <br/>
tank) <br/>
and we have to decide if we can spare the time to get to the next stop and <br/>
decode enough of the clue in 15 minutes to figure out the exact location. Oh, we <br/>
have <br/>
a lot of hints, degree coordinates, landmarks, etc., from the previous clues <br/>
but we just need a little more. I run to the last plaque, certain that I CAN <br/>
DO IT and what do I find? It's thirty-four *&amp;$%@! lines long!! AGGGGHHHHH!! I <br/>
get just enough of it figured out to render the whole puzzle useless (a little <br/>
knowledge is INDEED a dangerous thing) and we feel we are forced to give up. <br/>
If we'd only had a half hour longer. . .<br/>

     Takes me back to boxing in DC with all the one way streets that <br/>
