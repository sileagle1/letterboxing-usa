out on the posts... We're having our mini-gathering today at <br/>
Montville High School, Montville, CT. There will be a special Relay <br/>
for Life Stamp, clues to 6 or so boxes at Walden Nature Preserve in <br/>
Salem (10 min drive).  If you plan on hiking Walden, bring clues for <br/>
the other 3 boxes in Salem (Big Rock, Bee Happy, etc.).  Also some <br/>
travellers, exchanges, and a few well-known boxers from Eastern <br/>
Connecticut and lands abroad!  <br/>
<br/>
Should be a good day, we're meeting around 12noon at the grassy <br/>
circle as you drive into the high school! <br/>
