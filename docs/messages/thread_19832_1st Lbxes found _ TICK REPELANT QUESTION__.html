I ran across letterboxing while researching our upcoming trip to New England this fall (actually it was on a Connecticut website...I read the string of hilarious posts about CT being a lbx rich environment). My family went on our first search this weekend and we netted three found boxes and two mysterious no shows :) After my husband and I took a fresh look at the clues, while sitting at home, we realized we were probably looking in the wrong area of the park...<br/>
<br/>
My main question/concern is tick and bug repelant for adults and children. We went boxing on Saturday and Sunday and just this morning I have found two tiny ticks on my toddler. I hadn't noticed them on her before today. What do you seasoned hikers use to repel ticks on yourselves and on the wee ones that like to ramble in the brush? :) And a more sensitive question...how do you protect bare skin when nature calls?<br/>

Light-colored pants and shirts make tick-checks a bit easier. There's <br/>
the small worry of getting light-colored clothes clean after a kid <br/>
spends the day in the woods, but if your kids are like mine, you could <br/>
put 'em in entirely black clothes and they'd find a way to make the <br/>
clothes look dirty by the end of the day. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
And, don't panic. DO check everyone when you finish hiking, but ticks <br/>
take a while to actually settle in and bite you, so you do have some <br/>
time to find the buggers.<br/>
<br/>
Also, make sure everyone can identify poison ivy.......<br/>

Happy Boxing!<br/>

As a military wife, let me point out that they are actively being <br/>
discouraged from doing so and that these collars are not a great idea <br/>
for people due to the chemicals in/on the collars. I've copied an <br/>

    HEADLINE: Soldiers wear dog tags, not flea collars<br/>
<br/>
    SOURCE: North Jersey Media Group<br/>
<br/>
    BYLINE: BOB IVRY, STAFF WRITER<br/>
<br/>
    BODY:<br/>
    Hard candy is good. So is a toothbrush. But a flea-and-tick collar? <br/>
The Pentagon says that's definitely a no-no.<br/>
<br/>
    Sometime during the first gulf war, someone got the idea that pet <br/>
collars ward off the sand fleas that inhabit Kuwait and Iraq. The idea <br/>
caught on. <br/>
<br/>
    But some soldiers developed nasty chemical burns from wearing the <br/>
collars, usually around their ankles or wrists. Now Americans are being <br/>
asked to do their part for the war effort by keeping them on their dogs <br/>
and not including them in care packages.<br/>
<br/>
    "The collars are not intended for human use," said Virginia <br/>
Stephanakis, public affairs officer for the Army surgeon general. <br/>
"Humans often have adverse reactions to them."<br/>
<br/>
    Originally, the collars may have been requested by troops. The tiny, <br/>
biting sand fleas are especially pesky in summer.<br/>
<br/>
    "It became an urban legend," said Barbara Goodno, a Pentagon <br/>
spokeswoman. "The collars are still included on some checklists for <br/>
care packages."<br/>
<br/>
    According to a U.S. Navy health alert, first issued during Operation <br/>
Desert Shield, troops waiting for deployment "are buying massive <br/>
numbers of dog flea/tick collars for use on their person."<br/>
<br/>
    The alert went on to say the collar's insecticides suppress a key <br/>
enzyme in the human nervous system, cholinesterase.<br/>
<br/>
    "Since these insecticides act like nerve agents," the alert <br/>
concluded, "use of these collars may limit individual ability to <br/>
survive a chemical warfare attack."<br/>
<br/>
    There are no reports of this occurring, and the wearing of the <br/>
collars was hardly widespread in the first gulf war. Only 3 percent of <br/>
13,600 veterans surveyed after the war reported using the collars or <br/>
witnessed their comrades using them, the Defense Department said. And <br/>
only 5 percent of those troops reported adverse reactions, usually a <br/>
rash or chemical burn where the collar touched the skin.<br/>
<br/>
    Troops now in Iraq are issued DEET, a strong topical insect <br/>
repellent, Goodno said, and their uniforms are treated with permethrin, <br/>
another insect repellent.<br/>
<br/>
    Joan Bellofatto of the Bergen-Hudson chapter of the American Red <br/>
Cross, which assembles care packages for troops overseas, said she <br/>
never heard of including flea-and-tick collars.<br/>
<br/>
    She said people have been so generous that the Red Cross has <br/>
temporarily stopped taking donations for care packages.<br/>
<br/>
    "We have a four-month supply," she said. "But no flea-and-tick <br/>
collars that I know of."<br/>

&gt;     Hard candy is good. So is a toothbrush. But a<br/>
&gt; flea-and-tick collar? <br/>
&gt; The Pentagon says that's definitely a no-no.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     Sometime during the first gulf war, someone got<br/>
&gt; the idea that pet <br/>
&gt; collars ward off the sand fleas that inhabit Kuwait<br/>
&gt; and Iraq. The idea <br/>
&gt; caught on. <br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     But some soldiers developed nasty chemical burns<br/>
&gt; from wearing the <br/>
&gt; collars, usually around their ankles or wrists. Now<br/>
&gt; Americans are being <br/>
&gt; asked to do their part for the war effort by keeping<br/>
&gt; them on their dogs <br/>
&gt; and not including them in care packages.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     "The collars are not intended for human use,"<br/>
&gt; said Virginia <br/>
&gt; Stephanakis, public affairs officer for the Army<br/>
&gt; surgeon general. <br/>
&gt; "Humans often have adverse reactions to them."<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     Originally, the collars may have been requested<br/>
&gt; by troops. The tiny, <br/>
&gt; biting sand fleas are especially pesky in summer.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     "It became an urban legend," said Barbara<br/>
&gt; Goodno, a Pentagon <br/>
&gt; spokeswoman. "The collars are still included on some<br/>
&gt; checklists for <br/>
&gt; care packages."<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     According to a U.S. Navy health alert, first<br/>
&gt; issued during Operation <br/>
&gt; Desert Shield, troops waiting for deployment "are<br/>
&gt; buying massive <br/>
&gt; numbers of dog flea/tick collars for use on their<br/>
&gt; person."<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     The alert went on to say the collar's<br/>
&gt; insecticides suppress a key <br/>
&gt; enzyme in the human nervous system, cholinesterase.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     "Since these insecticides act like nerve<br/>

&gt; concluded, "use of these collars may limit<br/>
&gt; individual ability to <br/>
&gt; survive a chemical warfare attack."<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     There are no reports of this occurring, and the<br/>
&gt; wearing of the <br/>
&gt; collars was hardly widespread in the first gulf war.<br/>
&gt; Only 3 percent of <br/>
&gt; 13,600 veterans surveyed after the war reported<br/>
&gt; using the collars or <br/>
&gt; witnessed their comrades using them, the Defense<br/>
&gt; Department said. And <br/>
&gt; only 5 percent of those troops reported adverse<br/>
&gt; reactions, usually a <br/>
&gt; rash or chemical burn where the collar touched the<br/>
&gt; skin.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     Troops now in Iraq are issued DEET, a strong<br/>
&gt; topical insect <br/>
&gt; repellent, Goodno said, and their uniforms are<br/>
&gt; treated with permethrin, <br/>
&gt; another insect repellent.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     Joan Bellofatto of the Bergen-Hudson chapter of<br/>
&gt; the American Red <br/>
&gt; Cross, which assembles care packages for troops<br/>
&gt; overseas, said she <br/>
&gt; never heard of including flea-and-tick collars.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     She said people have been so generous that the<br/>
&gt; Red Cross has <br/>
&gt; temporarily stopped taking donations for care<br/>
&gt; packages.<br/>
&gt;     <br/>
&gt;     "We have a four-month supply," she said. "But no<br/>
&gt; flea-and-tick <br/>
&gt; collars that I know of."<br/>

My husband has had it for 5 or 6 years and it reaccures every year or so.  His was so bad he could hardly walk.  Now we know when his legs start hurting to get tested to see if it's back.  YES it DOES reaccure and YES you can be bit again and get it AGAIN!!  He's had it twice and it has reaccured twice.  <br/>
Personally I use the Deep Woods Off-just not on the face or hands.  I put my hand over my sons eyes when I spray their hair-just to keep it out of their eyes. <br/>
The 2 dogs we take get Frontline-they still get ticks and fleas but when these pesky critters bit the dogs they DIE!!!<br/>

out of my daughter's head 2 weeks ago, but it's not her first &amp; <br/>
won't be her last.  Here in CT we can pick up a tick going to the <br/>
mailbox.  My kids though are seasoned "tick hunters".  We stop every <br/>
half hour or so &amp; look over each other, making sure there aren't any <br/>
critters on us &amp; when we get back to the car at the end of the walk <br/>
we do a more thorough check.  There is a wonderful children's book <br/>
called "Crinkleroot's Guide to the Outdoors" (or something similar) <br/>
that will help you identify ticks, poison ivy, poison oak, &amp; other <br/>
plants in a very non-threatening way.  My kids loved it- &amp; we picked <br/>
it up by chance getting some letterboxes at a bookstore!  <br/>
<br/>
As for not wanting to put Deet on your kids- it's understandable, <br/>
but I'd rather put Deet on my kids than have them get Lyme disease <br/>
(just my personal opinion).  If you use child-safe bug repellents <br/>
you should be okay, but ask your pediatrician's opinion.  <br/>

&gt; &gt;     Joan Bellofatto of the Bergen-Hudson chapter of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the American Red <br/>
&gt; &gt; Cross, which assembles care packages for troops<br/>
&gt; &gt; overseas, said she <br/>
&gt; &gt; never heard of including flea-and-tick collars. <br/>
&gt; &gt;     <br/>
&gt; &gt;     She said people have been so generous that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Red Cross has <br/>
&gt; &gt; temporarily stopped taking donations for care<br/>
&gt; &gt; packages. <br/>
&gt; &gt;     <br/>
&gt; &gt;     "We have a four-month supply," she said. "But no<br/>
&gt; &gt; flea-and-tick <br/>
&gt; &gt; collars that I know of." <br/>
