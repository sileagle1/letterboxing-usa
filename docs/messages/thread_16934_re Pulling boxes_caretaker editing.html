                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Jena! I know you said to email you off-list, but I thought this topic <br/>
might be of interest to others who have adopted letterboxes and are listed as <br/>
"maintainer" on the LbNA website. Those boxes that still have the original placer <br/>
listed, with you as a maintainer, won't show up in your list if you go to <br/>
letterboxing.org &gt; member services &gt; my boxes. But if you are logged in to the <br/>
website and navigate to the box using the map or the search for boxes feature, <br/>
you should see the usual "edit/delete" buttons, and you can edit them as you <br/>
wish.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding pulling boxes for the winter, as others have said, it's up to you. <br/>
We've left a box over two winters now at the top of the continental divide, <br/>
where a nearby webcam shows 20 feet of hardpacked glacier, and it has survived <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for adopting Aisling's letterboxes: they are special treasures!<br/>
