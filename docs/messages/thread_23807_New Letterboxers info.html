When we get a 'Contact the Placer' note from someone that indicates <br/>
that they are new or this is their first box or some other <br/>
indication that they are new I copy and paste a list (below) that <br/>
should give them sufficient places to go to gain some knowledge. <br/>
This I paste to a thank you note thanking them for their update or <br/>
letterbox report. I keep the text in Word so it is a very easy thing <br/>
to do. If the individuals are in California I leave the Ca. listing <br/>
in ,otherwise I merely delete those listings. BTW, when was the last <br/>
time you non-newbies read the 'Code of Conduct'?<br/>
