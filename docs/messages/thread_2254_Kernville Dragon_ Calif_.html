<div>Placed 4/14/01, near the town of Kernville, in Kern 
and Tulare Counties (border area) by Don and Gwen.  Watch out for ticks, 
spiders &amp; snakes while poking around the rocks!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After the turn of the last century some very 
industrious people came to the Kern Valley seeking power.  While the 
peaceful valley didn't appear to most people as a powerful place these newcomers 
knew it had untapped resources.  A power Dragon was built complete with 
lair, tunnels and feeding tubes.  The Dragon consumed the resources from 
the valley and sent its power to outlying areas.  While many felt that the 
Dragon's power was good others questioned the value when it consumed the natural 
resources of the valley.  Today, the Dragon's value is still in 
question.  In solving the clues to these letterboxes (3) you will learn how 
to slow the Dragon's consumption.  You will need a screwdriver, paper and 
pencil as well as a compass for your quest.</div>
<div>    From the big white chicken in 
Kernville, Calif., drive north 3.1 miles and take the dirt road on your 
right.  Look for a sign "Siphon 21 &amp; 22".  Pass a free standing 
rock chimney and cross over a cattle guard.  You will come to a right turn, 
continue around the bend and take the right (lower) side of the Y.  Park at 
the end of the road after turning around.   Beware of broken glass in 
the road. </div>
<div>    Leaving your vehicle, head on a trail at 80 degrees at 
40 paces to a rocky scree. (Note:  If there is water coming down from 
your left, do not continue;  look for the box another day!)   
Continue across boulders heading for the big silver tubes.  Cross the creek 
either before or after passing under the tubes.</div>
<div>    The first lettercan is located on the east side of 
the south tube.  Look for the cement footing with 3 large bolts.  
Counting this footing, look behind the 3rd footing up the south side.  The 
can is under some movable rocks.</div>
<div>    The second part of your quest and the key to the third 
part is found in the small valley to the east.  Find the path on the north 
side of the creek.  After 1/4 mile or so you will see a large (50 Ft) non 
pine tree on the south side of the creek.  The path will start leaving the 
creek and continues up a slight rise.  Keep walking in an easterly 
direction and you will reach the small valley.  Look for the line of 8 old 
fence posts at 40 degrees.  Then look south for a large log leaning into a 
tree.  Walk toward that tree and then along a path 140 degrees from the 
tree at 24 paces you will pass another fence post.  50 paces on the 
path from the fence post, stop. Go down a faint path at 220 degrees for 10 
paces.  You will be standing near a big tanish-gold colored flat boulder 
that looks different from all the other boulders.  The rock has spit and a 
round hole is evident in the middle,  In the slit next to the hole you will 
find the letter can under some movable rocks.  From that spot you can see 
the north tube.</div>
<div>    The stamp is the clue key.  
Return to the big white Kernville chicken (get an ice cream cone). </div>
<div>     Travel one mile north of 
the Chicken and turn left on the small paved road.  Go over 3 speed bumps 
and stop at the intersection of KR Three Maintenance Road. Using your key solve 
the following for the location of the third can. 
Be discreet in this area; there is some vehicle traffic.</div>
