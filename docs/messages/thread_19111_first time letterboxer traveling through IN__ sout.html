the john bryan park boxes are really cool.  the frog series are <br/>
relatively easy, although some are missing. then there are the <br/>
yellow springs, oh boxes.<br/>
<br/>
once in cinci you could do any of the scout dog boxes in miami <br/>
whitewater park. she has a harry potter series that the kids may <br/>
like. then there are my boxes, the crappie fishing series. <br/>
<br/>
have a great time!!!<br/>
