&lt;&lt; you have a good point about Park rangers being grown<br/>
 up Eagle Scouts. But the issue between wanaandpete<br/>
 having their box being thrown out of a park shows that<br/>
 whether or not they are grown up eagle scouts those<br/>
 park rangers still may object. <br/>
<br/>
 also, I agree with the idea of a non profit<br/>
 organization for letterboxing as well, but then you<br/>
 have the issue that it would have to be seperate<br/>
 organizations for each region because letterboxing is<br/>
 spread over great distances. Since we would be<br/>
 needing several organizations we would have to find<br/>
 people to run them and people to work for it, that<br/>
 would be very difficult. I would say that a non<br/>
 profit organization is a little beyond us right now<br/>
 but we should keep it in mind for a later date when<br/>
 letterboxing is more 'public'.<br/>
