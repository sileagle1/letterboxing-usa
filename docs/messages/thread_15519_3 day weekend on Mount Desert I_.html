Binx and I took a wonderful camping trip to MDI this weekend (my <br/>
first trip there). The weather was great and the scenery was better!<br/>
<br/>
We had very mixed results as far as boxing goes. We lucked out our <br/>
first day, finding 8 of 8 boxes plus one HH, including brilliant work <br/>
by legerdemaine (two) and Memlili (four...we LOVED the Forgotten <br/>
Souls sleuthing work and the stamps!). We picked up Uncle Sam's Hat <br/>
HH at Lamoine State Park and doffed it elsewhere in the area.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday was NOT our day as we went 0 for 6 attempts! We were really <br/>
hoping to find some of the more difficult boxes by Tom Cooch and <br/>
legerdemaine but we'll have to better research the clues and search <br/>
the archives for "found" reports. The hikes and scenery were <br/>
definitely worth it regardless!<br/>
<br/>
We managed to find one box on Monday (with a surprise replacement <br/>
stamp by legerdemaine...what a treat!) out of four attempts total for <br/>
the day.<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to the placers...we envy those of you who reside on the <br/>
island!<br/>
