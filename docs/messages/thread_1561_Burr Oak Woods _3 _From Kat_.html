Hello: I've checked on things at Watkins Mill -- the letterboxes seem <br/>
fine, but I wonder if the letterboxers have gone missing. I've also <br/>
hidden another letterbox this weekend at Burr Oak Woods. Here's the <br/>
clue. <br/>
Regards,<br/>
Kat.<br/>
<br/>
Burr Oak Woods Conservation Area<br/>
20 miles east of Kansas City, Missouri<br/>
<br/>
Open daily from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. during Daylight Savings Time and <br/>
from 8 a.m. until 6 p.m. during Central Standard Time. Closed <br/>
Thanksgiving, Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The area is composed <br/>
of 1,071 acres of woodlands, fields and ponds, and includes five self-<br/>
guided nature trails, two of which are paved and fully accessible. <br/>
Two sack-lunch picnic areas include shelter, tables and a privy. <br/>
Pets, even leashed pets, are NOT allowed.<br/>
<br/>
Please Note:  Specific permission for letterboxing has been neither<br/>
requested of nor granted by the area administrators, so discretion is<br/>
appreciated. The information desk in the nature center has available <br/>
a very nice (and free) tri-fold with a good map of the area.<br/>
<br/>
Bethany Falls Trail is 1.3 miles of easy wood chip-covered terrain,<br/>
dependable in all weather.<br/>
