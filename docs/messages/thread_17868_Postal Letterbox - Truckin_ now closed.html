                    <div class="plaintext-content">You can do whatever you like! We have only been in letterboxing since January and this is the first time we've "gone postal".  Our philosophy is the more the merrier. The only reason we were trying to limit it to 50 names is so that we get it back within as close to a year as possible (we're gonna miss this guy!). We're not even sure how everyone else handles their postal letterboxes. We assume that the person mailing it to the next person pays for postage, right? But do you actually put it in a box? In a mailing envelope? DO you include mailing labels for everyone on the list? We were going to email the list and ask these questions be we decided not to. We're just going to do what we want to do and it will be okay. So you can invite whomever you like to join in the fun. But it would save time if they all met together at your place. I closed the box at 50 names but received some stragglers this morning so it's closer to 60 names. If you figure on it getting to one person a week that<br/>
 is still more than a year before it's 2004 US Tour ends. <br/>
Oh well. It'll still be cool. Invite, enjoy! <br/>
