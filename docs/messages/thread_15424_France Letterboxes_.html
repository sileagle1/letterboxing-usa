Does anyone know of any sites for Letterboxes in France?  I suspect I <br/>
will be in Paris once we are done at the company HQ.<br/>

Paris is always great.   I hope you get outside to see the country too.  It<br/>

I'm going to go ahead and paste portions of an email that I sent to that<br/>
French journalist that wrote to the list a while ago.  I'm too lazy to<br/>
rewrite the whole bit.  Maybe it will help you have some ideas for<br/>
letterboxing in France.  You might want to check with that woman to see if<br/>
she knows of any new letterboxes too.   I was sad to come away with no<br/>
letterboxes.  I certainly put in my work to get them.  It was the first time<br/>
I came away angry at another letterboxer.  Somehow spending hours and hours<br/>
going around to totally unremarkable locations only to come away with no<br/>
stamp and being threatened by scary-looking guys in a strange neighborhood<br/>
was not my cup of tea.  I mean, I can handle the death threats, but to come<br/>
away with no boxes . . . :-)  j/k<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you do find anything out there.  I believe the two boxes in<br/>
the Brittany are still active.<br/>

<br/>
Actually, letterboxing has begun in France, although truthfully I think that<br/>
the boxes planted were from Brits.  I went looking for several boxes while I<br/>
was in Paris.  I will send you an address for their clues, but to tell you<br/>
the truth, it won't be worth your time to find them.  I looked and didn't<br/>
find anything.  I didn't like the ones in Paris at all.  They weren't in<br/>
good locations at all and I didn't find anything I looked for.<br/>
<br/>
The ones I looked for and didn't find are at this site.  I didn't find any.<br/>
To be fair, I didn't actually finish looking for the one in the lamppost<br/>
(garden) as I didn't feel right about scaling a huge fence surrounding<br/>
private property.  I also didn't want to climb up a large wall with only<br/>
small cracks in it like the same people had at input1.  Those two could have<br/>
possibly been there, but I was looking from many angles and couldn't see<br/>
what could have been a letterbox.  The letterboxes planted by this couple<br/>
were irresponsible and dangerous.  The one that was in the disused railway<br/>
line was on clearly closed property.  I had to trespass, and I imagine break<br/>
the law to get to the spot.  It was in a very dark, long, abandoned tunnel.<br/>
I was terrified that if something were to happen to me while I was there, I<br/>
might never be found.  It was too dark to see if anyone was hiding there.  I<br/>
had to climb very high, and when I was coming back I was threatened by two<br/>
locals who saw me.  Please don't use this website as an example of how to do<br/>
letterboxing!!!!  You don't want to teach people irresponsible and dangerous<br/>
letterboxing.  It will bring a bad name on the whole community.  One of the<br/>
boxes was safely placed and nicely worded (the one that is in French), but I<br/>
couldn't find it.  I found every step of the clue and spent forever looking,<br/>
but the spot that I think it was supposed to be hidden in had digging around<br/>
it for a different grave.  I think it might have been dug up with it.  I<br/>
liked that clue, but some might take offense to planting in a graveyard and<br/>
feel it is disrespectful.  I am only sending you this website to show you<br/>
there has been some letterboxing in France.<br/>

<br/>
There are two other French boxes that I know about.  Unfortunately, I was<br/>
unable to get out to them during my trip to Paris last month.  I do know of<br/>
someone who told me she found them already.  She will be coming to Paris in<br/>
September.  <br/>
<br/>
The two French boxes are located at http://www.GlobalLetterBoxing.org/  They<br/>
are with a large list of letterboxes found outside of Dartmoor.<br/>
<br/>
I might have some pictures of letterboxing activities.  I will look and let<br/>
you know if I have anything helpful.  Best of luck.  I hope that you have a<br/>
lot of success with this article.<br/>
