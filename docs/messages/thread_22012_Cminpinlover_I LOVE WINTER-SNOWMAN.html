<br/>
I am searching for this PLB.  The P.O. stated you got the box on March 25. <br/>
I'm sure you don't have it yet but do you have  any idea to whom you sent it?  <br/>
This is the latest news I have on the PLB.  It is spring and I'm trying to get <br/>
it home.<br/>
If you should get icefishing or homemade cookies please return them to me <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.  <br/>

Fishing. Hope this helps Lynn of MINPIN LOVERS<br/>

I have been away from my home and my postal mailbox for about 2 months now.  I see there are tons of requests for the Winter PLB series returns.  I can see from looking at my INCREDIBLY massive pile of mail that there is at least one of them in there.  By the end of the weekend, I will have gotten through everything in the pile and sorted out the "real" mail from the bills and stuff.  If I have any of them they will be on their way home early next week.<br/>
