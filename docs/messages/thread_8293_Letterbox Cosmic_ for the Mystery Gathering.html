There are those among us with knowledge of upcoming events cosmic, <br/>
prophets seen by so-called science and by temporary authority as <br/>
unreliable, and therefore harried and persecuted, harried and <br/>
persecuted as were the now-respected seers and saints of old, but who <br/>
know, who really KNOW and who understand, who truly UNDERSTAND the <br/>
nature of the upcoming disaster which will overwhelm the Earth and <br/>
all who call her home, the clear and unavoidable disaster which we <br/>
are powerless to avoid and which is perhaps retribution for our <br/>
mistakes, our great and unchangeable mistakes. Secrets are kept by <br/>
the governments of the United States, Russia, and Japan, secrets kept <br/>
which if revealed to the public would cause widespread terror and <br/>
panic, which if revealed would release a terror and a panic such as <br/>
has never been contemplated. There are those, however, those who know <br/>
the truth, who understand the foreshadowing, and who are not afraid <br/>
to speak in the face of overwhelming and insurmountable forces, speak <br/>
loudly and forcefully, speak to explain the coming events, the events <br/>
of destruction and to explain, to explain clearly and for all to hear <br/>
who would listen, the single option, the only possible option for our <br/>
survival, the survival of the people of this wonderful, this generous <br/>
planet.<br/>
<br/>
There is a heavenly body previously unknown in our Solar System, a <br/>
planet large and gaseous, a planet on a steeply elliptical orbit, <br/>
perhaps a loose galactic body snared by the sun's gravity, and this <br/>
planet is now on a collision course with earth. Sweeping in silently <br/>
and unseen by all but the most sophisticated radars and telescopes, <br/>
this object was code named "Planet X" by NASA and the FPCS when <br/>
detected in 1967 but has been known for millennia by prophets and <br/>
bears the name Nibiru and an ancient and mystic culture of creatures <br/>
of foresight and holiness, the Nibiruiata.<br/>
<br/>
The Nibiru Letterbox<br/>
Through the gate in the Northern fence, find a line of standing pipes <br/>
that serve as mounts for amateur telescopes on clear nights. Line <br/>
them up and follow that bearing (200*) down south to the edge of the <br/>
grass and look a few feet into the bushes. The answers you seek are <br/>
under a flat rock.<br/>
<br/>
When a tidal wave is forecasted, we evacuate the beach. Foreknowledge <br/>
of Nibiru leaves us just one option.<br/>
