live in or near an urban area. If you live in one of the five boroughs <br/>
of New York City, or Westchester, Rockland, Suffolk, Orange, Nassau, or <br/>
Putnam County, this will be a small, private group for those who love <br/>
letterboxing and want to perhaps meet and greet other boxers nearby for <br/>
exchanges or boxing in this area or others. Maybe you are looking for <br/>
boxing buddies? Maybe you just want to talk about your favorite hobby? <br/>
Join us. <br/>
