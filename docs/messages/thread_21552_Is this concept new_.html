I recently planted a box in an area a friend of mine showed me and<br/>
which we decided would be great for letterboxes, but that we want to<br/>
keep kind of quiet.  I started considering making it WOM or creating<br/>
Cuckoo clues for it.  The problems I have had or see with those<br/>
methods are these:<br/>
<br/>
1. WOM clues get passed around and the list of people who know about<br/>
it can grow exponentially.  Not so great if you want to place  a box<br/>
in an area where you don't want to create high traffic for whatever<br/>
reason, usually ecological.<br/>
<br/>
2. Cuckoo clues by their nature give you no assurance that the person<br/>
who finds them will be a person you want to find your box.  For<br/>
example, a vandal might find a box where the cuckoo clues reside, and<br/>
then have the clues to your box.  Not good.<br/>
<br/>
So, here is what I thought of.  I have no name for it yet, if it is<br/>
even a new idea.  I am going to create a nice, durable cluebook, and<br/>
perhaps a logbook as well.  The clues will be in this cluebook, but<br/>
the instructions will expressly request that the clues never be copied<br/>
down to any other printed form.  Nor, should the existence of the box,<br/>
much less the clues themselves ever be spread by word of mouth.  After<br/>
the person who is given the cluebook finds the box, they pass the<br/>
cluebook physically to another person who they feel is trustworthy. <br/>
And so on.  This way eventually most people in a lboxing community<br/>
will get to find the box, but the time that takes will be spread out<br/>
much further than usual thus reducing the impact of the box on it's<br/>
environment.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I explained that clearly enough.  I posted this here to see<br/>
what everyone thinks about the concept, and to see if perhaps it<br/>
already has a name.   <br/>

@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/>
<br/>
For 2005, a group of us -- Keith &amp; I with the other members of The Oops Gang, <br/>
plus TurboTurtle who just moved into the area in January -- got together and <br/>
decided to start our own yahoogroup list and we're going to post the clues in <br/>
the files section of the group list as we place the boxes this year.   This <br/>
list will have no "discussion" on it.  It's just a place for us to house our <br/>
clues when I get them written.  <br/>
<br/>
I plan to write it into each set of clues requesting that the clues not be <br/>
passed by word-of-mouth to anyone who isn't on the list.  That way, by keeping <br/>
the number of list members to a lowish number, we can help protect the <br/>
environments where we'll be placing our 2005 boxes.  All we can do is trust that <br/>
boxers will honour that request and not pass the clues around.   <br/>
<br/>
With your proposed system of having to physically pass the cluebook from one <br/>
party to another, that would mean it would only be available to folks who do <br/>
get together with each other, or who at least feel they know each other enough <br/>
to maybe want to have each other's names and addresses for mailing the <br/>
cluebook -- something like what seems to be done with postal letterboxes.  That might <br/>
be reeeeeeeeeeally narrowing down the number of boxers depending on how much <br/>
the boxers in your area either get together or know each other.  But that <br/>
might be what you're after.  You don't say how restrictive you want to get.  You <br/>
might find that "most people in a lbing community" aren't really all that in <br/>
touch with other as it sometimes seems.  But that obviously likely varies from <br/>
one neck of the woods to another.<br/>
<br/>
You're also relying on people to "judge" whether another person is <br/>
"trustworthy" or not, and a lot of folks *think* they know each other and they really <br/>
have no idea just how little they really know.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to worry about with your system is that it's sort of like <br/>
letting loose a hitchhiker.  You could end up with someone who keeps the cluebook <br/>
in their backpack for the next year and you'd never know it.   <br/>
<br/>
When I set up our list, we weren't out to make things *terribly* restrictive. <br/>
 But we're hoping to place boxes in areas that seem, to us at least, to have <br/>
either a lot of historical significance or a lot of environmental significance <br/>
or both, and therefor a kind of spiritual significance to us, and we want to <br/>
avoid as much potential for damage as possible.  So we sat around one night <br/>
trying to figure how to make the clues "quieter" and also how to be less <br/>
involved ourselves in giving out the clues.  Last year, with our word-of-mouth boxes, <br/>
we handled them a variety of ways.  But they all really involved folks having <br/>
to get in touch with me to email them the clues.  Or else meet up with us on <br/>
the trail, and at the hours we usually box, that's unlikely to happen.  This <br/>
way, they can just go to the files section of the group and grab the clues for <br/>
themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
And if things change with a particular box, we can also update the clues in <br/>
the files section.  With your cluebook, say, for example, things don't work out <br/>
well for the box in one particular location and you want to move the box 100 <br/>
feet in another direction.  How do you get word to whoever would have the <br/>
cluebook at the time?  Or will you be relying on folks to check in with you as <br/>
they pass on the cluebook so that you'll have a way to contact the latest person <br/>
to have the book so they can make a change in the clues for you?  <br/>
<br/>
I don't know how well relying on something like that would work.  Look at <br/>
hitchhikers.  We've found several that had an email addy attached to them asking <br/>
for folks to contact the owner when they found it.  Oftentimes I'll get in <br/>
touch with an owner only to have them write me back, thanking me for getting in <br/>
touch, and telling me that nobody has gotten in touch since 2003 or some such <br/>
year, and there might be 15 or 20 entries from 2004.  And the email addy and <br/>
request to be contacted are right in the logbook and it's a perfectly good addy. <br/>
 But finders just don't get around to doing the contacting.  <br/>

Well, any letterbox you plant is going to have to be found by people.<br/>
 I have already concluded that placing a box and trying to control<br/>
exactly who has the clues is too much trouble and will only lead to<br/>
irritation.  That's my view.  So, in this scenario, only ONE<br/>
letterboxer at a time will be able to find the box.  So, it makes it<br/>
special, and it keeps the traffic spread out.  Plus it should never be<br/>
spoken of, only passed along.  I would say you could pass it along<br/>
even secretly as long as you were postitive the recipient actually<br/>
finds it :)  And yes it would be a special cluebook just for one box,<br/>
or even a series, but not a cluebook full of box clues.  I guess it;s<br/>
work, but not too much more than a normal box.  Especially those where<br/>
people make such beautiful logbooks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; down to any other printed form.  Nor, should the<br/>
&gt; &gt; existence of the box,<br/>
&gt; &gt; much less the clues themselves ever be spread by<br/>
&gt; &gt; word of mouth.  After<br/>
&gt; &gt; the person who is given the cluebook finds the box,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they pass the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cluebook physically to another person who they feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; is trustworthy. <br/>
&gt; &gt; And so on.  This way eventually most people in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lboxing community<br/>
&gt; &gt; will get to find the box, but the time that takes<br/>
&gt; &gt; will be spread out<br/>
&gt; &gt; much further than usual thus reducing the impact of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box on it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; environment.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully I explained that clearly enough.  I posted<br/>
&gt; &gt; this here to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; what everyone thinks about the concept, and to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; if perhaps it<br/>
&gt; &gt; already has a name.   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions or comments?<br/>

Are we trying to keep the "stupid and lazy people" away, or are we trying to make this sport available to all people to include people who can not hike long distances and little kids?  Neither of the groups are "stupid or lazy".  If I am taking offense to your statment and no offfense was meant I am sorry.  However I do not believe that this sport is exclusive to "smart and in shape" people.<br/>

I have been considering making the clues in the cluebook quite<br/>
challenging to solve.  I am trying to create something interesting and<br/>
entertaining for other boxers, so this is a good idea.<br/>

No, it's not exclusive, but to create a special box means that not<br/>
EVERY single letterboxer will know about it.  Who will not know about<br/>
it?  If the clues are VERY difficult, they are more fun for some<br/>
people, and others will never bother.  <br/>

While I consider myself neither stupid nor lazy, I still <br/>
failed on my first attempt to find one of Mr. Sangfroid's <br/>
boxes, but I'm looking forward to going back for another <br/>

I like it! The cluebook idea sounds like the way the Dartmoor clue <br/>
directories work, but for just a single box. Except for the part <br/>
where the existence of the book is a secret, and the part about how <br/>
it gets passed around. Gives me an idea for something I'd like to do <br/>
as well...<br/>

This lowest common denominator mentality makes me crazier. Above of<br/>
all there are no rules, do what you want. There are many boxes made by<br/>
the stupid and lazy for the stupid and lazy and there are many boxes<br/>
made by the obnoxious and elitist for the obnoxious and elitist and<br/>
everywhere in between. The biggest problem is that this hobby is no<br/>
longer passed by wom amongst like-minded friends. It has been<br/>
publicised to the masses so now we must deal with the entire range of<br/>
ability, creativity and fitness, and I think is happening just fine.<br/>

Does every car run on regular? If it pings use ethel. How about <br/>
those diesel burners? Only want to ride a bicycle, go for it.<br/>
<br/>
There is sufficient ways to play this game, just don't place <br/>
restrictions on those that wish to play it differently. If you don't <br/>
like a certain type letterbox then don't look for it. If you only <br/>
want to place difficult types of boxes then that is your choice.<br/>

Well said I think.  And Don too.  There are boxes of all sorts and in<br/>
some areas, tons of boxes of all sorts.  I personally enjoy almost all<br/>
of them, though the more challenging, the more rewarding to me.  For<br/>
those who don't enjoy a challenge, don't accept one.  I think that's<br/>
how things usually work anyway.  <br/>

I agree, and would like to see more of the old style, more underground<br/>
feel to the hobby that I wasn't around for or in the right country to<br/>
fully experience, but which appeals to me very much.  Was that a<br/>
run-on sentence or what?<br/>

&gt; Are we trying to keep the "stupid and lazy people" away, or are we<br/>
trying to make this sport available to all people to include people<br/>
who can not hike long distances and little kids?  Neither of the<br/>
groups are "stupid or lazy".  If I am taking offense to your statment<br/>
and no offfense was meant I am sorry.  However I do not believe that<br/>
this sport is exclusive to "smart and in shape" people.<br/>

I don't know if you followed the thread back to the beginning, but the<br/>
"placer" is trying to LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE FINDING THIS BOX!<br/>
No we are not trying to keep anyone away (I am not anyway). Lets all<br/>
admit something though: SOME PEOPLE ARE STUPID AND LAZY! I too have a<br/>
little child who cannot hike more than a mile or so, I too enjoy a<br/>
driveby, and I also know a handicapped letterboxer. This does not<br/>
change the fact that SOME PEOPLE ARE STUPID AND LAZY! Nor does it<br/>
change the FACT that not all letterboxes are(or should be) designed<br/>
for all letterboxers! REALLY DIFFICULT CLUE KEEP SOME PEOPLE AWAY! I<br/>
am sorry if you chose to be offended(I certainly wasn't trying to<br/>
single you out). And not to come off as a total jerk(I'm not!) if you<br/>
were offended because I mentioned 'stupid and lazy' people; it sounds<br/>
like you might have some self-esteem issues.<br/>

Nothing better than a lazy river on a lazy summer day.   I always thought of <br/>
lazy rivers and lazy summer days as positives.   :-)   <br/>
<br/>
In fact, we'll be planting some boxes by a lazy river this spring or summer.  <br/>
But I'll bet if folks go search by the lazy river on the lazy summer day, the <br/>
bugs won't be so lazy!<br/>
<br/>
Turtles would qualify for lazy too I'd guess.  And turtles are Class Acts.  <br/>
(A lot of our 2005 boxes will revolve around turtles.) <br/>
<br/>
So I'll admit to being lazy.  Still have to read the definition of stupid <br/>
tho.  I've been too lazy to do that yet.<br/>

I still can't get over that there are people who have the problem of<br/>
too much traffic. (Legitimate I am sure but mind boggling nonetheless)<br/>
If I put out a WOM clue nothing would ever happen.<br/>
Here in glorious Utah my boxes go for many months without ever having<br/>
a single visitor and these are just the driveby boxes not the ones<br/>
buried in the snow.<br/>
So for all you guy longing for "the good ole days" there are still<br/>
lots of states available and Utah is one of them!<br/>

&gt; I recently planted a box in an area a friend of mine showed me and<br/>
&gt; which we decided would be great for letterboxes, but that we want to<br/>
&gt; keep kind of quiet.  I started considering making it WOM or creating<br/>
&gt; Cuckoo clues for it.  The problems I have had or see with those<br/>
&gt; methods are these:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1. WOM clues get passed around and the list of people who know about<br/>
&gt; it can grow exponentially.  Not so great if you want to place  a box<br/>
&gt; in an area where you don't want to create high traffic for whatever<br/>
&gt; reason, usually ecological.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2. Cuckoo clues by their nature give you no assurance that the person<br/>
&gt; who finds them will be a person you want to find your box.  For<br/>
&gt; example, a vandal might find a box where the cuckoo clues reside, and<br/>
&gt; then have the clues to your box.  Not good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, here is what I thought of.  I have no name for it yet, if it is<br/>
&gt; even a new idea.  I am going to create a nice, durable cluebook, and<br/>
&gt; perhaps a logbook as well.  The clues will be in this cluebook, but<br/>
&gt; the instructions will expressly request that the clues never be copied<br/>
&gt; down to any other printed form.  Nor, should the existence of the box,<br/>
&gt; much less the clues themselves ever be spread by word of mouth.  After<br/>
&gt; the person who is given the cluebook finds the box, they pass the<br/>
&gt; cluebook physically to another person who they feel is trustworthy. <br/>
&gt; And so on.  This way eventually most people in a lboxing community<br/>
&gt; will get to find the box, but the time that takes will be spread out<br/>
&gt; much further than usual thus reducing the impact of the box on it's<br/>
&gt; environment.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hopefully I explained that clearly enough.  I posted this here to see<br/>
&gt; what everyone thinks about the concept, and to see if perhaps it<br/>
&gt; already has a name.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any suggestions or comments?<br/>

Not a new idea, but creative and very much in the spirit of the game.  <br/>
I personally love receiving WOM clues, cluebooks, and other privately <br/>
distributed clues.  I think it adds to the intrigue and although you <br/>
still do not have complete control of who eventually ends up with the <br/>
clues, you have significantly decreased the chances of bad stuff <br/>
happening to the box.  Would like to see more of this type of play.<br/>
