A new mystery letterbox called Twenty Questions has been placed under <br/>
two relatively flat rocks somewhere in the United States.  Although <br/>
it is initially classified as a mystery box, as time goes on its <br/>
location is most likely to become less of a mystery.  Here's why:<br/>
<br/>
Every day or so for the next twenty days I will answer exactly one <br/>
YES or NO question regarding the location of the box.  As the <br/>
questions are asked and answered, over time the location of the box <br/>
will be become clearer.  If they answers are not too helpful, then <br/>
the location will remain shrouded in mystery.<br/>
<br/>
Where will the questions come from you ask?  Well, from any of you.  <br/>
Each day you may submit one question to me (The Ephemeral <br/>
Letterboxer) via Contact the Placer on LbNA or by sending me an e-<br/>
mail using the letterbox-usa "Send Email" feature.  Please do not <br/>
send your questions out to the entire letterbox-usa list.  Out of all <br/>
of the questions submitted each day I will choose one question to <br/>
answer using an undisclosed, pre-determined method and discard the <br/>
rest.  I will post the answer to this question on the letterbox-usa <br/>
Yahoo mailing list and also update the LbNA description for the box <br/>
so that it contains a list of the answered questions.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, the quality of the questions chosen will determine the <br/>
quality of the clues to the box - so ask carefully.<br/>
<br/>
There is only one restriction on the questions:  I must be able to <br/>
answer them YES or NO.  Any questions that cannot be answered YES or <br/>
NO by me will be discarded.<br/>
<br/>
After the twenty questions are answered no more clues to the location <br/>
of the box will be provided.  No attempts to contact the placer will <br/>
be responded to.  I (The Ephemeral Letterboxer) will disappear back <br/>
into the ether, perhaps never to return.<br/>
<br/>
Day 1 is now open for questions.  Fire away.  You have roughly 24 <br/>
hours to send your initial questions as described above.<br/>
<br/>

Sincerely,<br/>

state.  I agree with a few of you.  Maybe this next question should be a <br/>
risky one.<br/>
<br/>
How about: Is it within a government owned area within a town that <br/>
borders the atlantic ocean?<br/>
<br/>
Or.... How about does the name of the municipality contain the letter "S"?<br/>
<br/>
That would dramatically reduce the number of towns/cities.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was thinking of asking if the box was located within an area that one is<br/>
"supposed" to pay admission.   I say "supposed to" b/c often State parks<br/>
like Hopkinton are supposed to charge admission, but often there is no one<br/>
there to collect money.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, looking at this again:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
10Q's left<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1.  Is it in X county?<br/>
<br/>
2.	Is it in a town/city that starts with A - H?  <br/>
<br/>
a.	If this is in Middlesex, that would leave 22 towns if yes and 32<br/>
towns if no<br/>
b.	If this is in Essex, that would leave 11 towns if yes, and 23 tows<br/>
if no<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So that would leave 8 questions to narrow it down from there.....if we're at<br/>
32 towns and 8 questions, ... eek!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since it's under "two relatively flat rocks,"  I'd guess it's not inside a<br/>
building.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would it be uncool to ask "Is the box within 5 miles of the following LB's?"<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm trying to think of categories that we could use to rule in/out large<br/>
areas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts??<br/>
