Not at all! 3 new letterboxes in RI! I've got to ask: what is a Bored <br/>
Nocturnal Adventurer? Someone who is sick of NBC Olympics and <br/>
actually out on the trails with headlamps at night?<br/>
<br/>
Way to go! We'll get these clues up on the map today or tomorrow (as <br/>
well as the others still pending from the last 2 weeks when I was <br/>
away)<br/>

<br/>
Heh... That would do as an explanation...<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, RI has *nothing* to do late at night, and<br/>
not all of us meet the qualificaitons for "day person".<br/>
<br/>
Also, myself and a few friends discovered (several years ago)<br/>
that RI has a lot of interesting historical sites, such as<br/>
abandoned military sites, quarries, 17th century and earlier<br/>
ruins etc.  Those who currently control access to these<br/>
places usually frown on visitors, however (for liability<br/>
reasons, i presume, since all the most interesting places<br/>
could count as "dangerous" <g>).<br/>
<br/>
The solution to both problems?  Go at night.<br/>
<br/>
We don't plunder, or vandalize, just explore.<br/>
<br/>
Then, one day, we had the idea to make a web page<br/>
documenting our findings, maps, techniques of avoiding<br/>
arrest for tresspassing, good gear to bring for safety,<br/>
and the like, for others feeling similarly impressed with<br/>
RI's nighttime entertainment scene.  We never got around<br/>
to putting anything on the page, though, until now.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, letterboxing at night really beats the heat in the<br/>
summer... We just discovered letterboxing this spring (when<br/>
we stumbled across the Wickaboxet Firetower Ledge box,<br/>
during the day, incidentally), so don't know how well<br/>
night-boxing will work in the winter, but...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Way to go! We'll get these clues up on the map today or tomorrow<br/>
&gt; (as well as the others still pending from the last 2 weeks when<br/>

<br/>
Ah, very good.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we had wondered, might we link to the LBNA's "disclaimer" page,<br/>
or make a local copy?<br/>

I used to shop for cars this way.  Much less sales hassle to compare<br/>
equipment, etc after 9 PM.... also some "no admittance" drinking water<br/>
resevoirs are best fished for lunker bass after dark!<br/>
<br/>
Have not tried night time exploration of historical places... hmmm...<br/>
