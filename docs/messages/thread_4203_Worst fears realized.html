    After a nice ski in to Mount Pisgah Fledglings, with light snow <br/>

and has been discovered by a number of those folks.  I posted this to <br/>
the virtual log book for the geocache:<br/>
<br/>
"Folks, I did not visit the cache but I did visit the nearby <br/>
letterbox. The stamp has gone missing from the letterbox. That stamp <br/>
was hand-carved and was left there for use by letterboxers only. It <br/>
was not a bit of treasure to be exchanged. My hope is that a <br/>
Geocacher mistook the letterbox for the Geocache and did not <br/>
understand the havoc they created for our sport.  TheHuntingHounds <br/>
reported they left the stamp intact on 1/1. The stamp was noticed <br/>
missing on 1/12. If the holder of the stamp reads this, the honorable <br/>
thing to do is to return the stamp to the letterbox, please. -<br/>

    When planting new boxes, it may be prudent to use geocache.com to <br/>
search for caches near, or at, your planned location.  The geocachers <br/>
expect to take something away from their visit (besides a stamp <br/>
image) and that puts our boxes at risk.<br/>
    I will work the geocache mailing list to raise awareness of the <br/>
possible conflicts.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Eric O'Connor and I post as Choberiba on several <br/>
geocaching forums.<br/>
<br/>
I started a usenet group alt.rec.geocaching<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is on topic in that group per the charter I wrote when <br/>
submitting the control messages.<br/>
<br/>
I subscribed to your list to act as an informal liaison.<br/>
<br/>
I created the email address <br/>
letterboxing@cachestash.com for this purpose, but it automagically <br/>
forwards to my primary account anyway.<br/>

<br/>
Geocaches can range in size from a 35mm film canister to a five <br/>
gallon bucket. Most are about one or two gallons in volume.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (I have only seen 2 geocaches and both were huge containers <br/>

<br/>
Unfortunately this might have been the act of a beginner.<br/>
Some geocaches contain nothing but a paper logbook and a writing <br/>
utensil, but those are rare.<br/>
<br/>
I've never peronally been to a letterbox site, so I can not comment <br/>
on how similar they are, other than what little I know about your <br/>
hobby. (Stamp+box+paper = letterbox?)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Amanda,  We just saw your Nancy Drew in St.Louis today.  I am sorry if <br/>
that geocache/letterbox gave you a bad taste.  It is full of "junk"  but not <br/>
overflowing and most geocachers have been very careful about not destroying <br/>
the area.   <br/>
  We visited the box because the owner is out of the area and we received <br/>
several notes that the Letterboxing stamp was missing.  We replaced that <br/>
stamp and thumbed through the log book.  There were quite a few logs from <br/>
combo letterboxer/geocachers or "LetterCachers".  Unfortunately the last <br/>
entry before the stamp disappeared was from a letterboxer ... and just the <br/>
very day after we had visited it again with my neighbors..   <br/>
   I have to admit that I have had to return to a letterbox before when I <br/>
realized I had placed the wrong stamp back into my kit.  Sometimes it happens.<br/>
<br/>
I think both are fine sports as long as everyone is careful to respect one <br/>
another's property and individual preferences.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>

    Thanks for the discussion on this.<br/>
    There is no way I want to start any sort of war here.  Recent <br/>
chatter on this list has pointed out the need for the respective Web <br/>
sites to cross-mention the other sport.<br/>
    Letterboxes are supposed to contain documentation about their <br/>
use. This one did but it was an old box and the sheets were somewhat <br/>
waterlogged.  <br/>
    I did make some assumptions.  I assumed that teenage parties and <br/>
kids making forts occur less frequently with snow on the ground.  I <br/>
also assumed that a fair number of people received their first GPS <br/>
for Christmas.  I also thought about the fact that this box had lost <br/>
a stamp before the geocache existed.  Of course it could have been <br/>
anyone that walked off with it, or dropped it in the snow and could <br/>
not find it.  <br/>
    I posted to your list on the chance it was a beginner geocacher.  <br/>
I actually hope it was, because I think that is our best chance of <br/>
getting the stamp back!  My apologies for making it appear I was <br/>
pointing a finger at your sport.  <br/>
    There is naturally going to be some kidding back and forth <br/>
between groups but some people will enjoy both.  Who knows, maybe <br/>
someday I'll turn into an electronic homing pigeon myself...!<br/>

&gt; I'm very sorry to hear that the Fledglings are missing. I am going to <br/>
&gt; retire the box. Sometime soon I'll be out there to remove the box and <br/>
&gt; will remove the clues from the website.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for letting me know it's gone.<br/>

Betsey, I'm sorry to hear the stamp was stolen for a second time.  It <br/>
was one of my favorites that you have carved.  Well, if nothing else, <br/>
the fact that your stamps get taken is a tribute to how nice they are!<br/>
<br/>
In the future, I may start adding a note to my boxes pleading with <br/>
people not only to rehide the box carefully but to please not steal the <br/>
stamp.  It makes me sad that people actually feel they can take other <br/>
people's creative efforts.  Don't they feel guilty about it???<br/>

&gt; I believe the problem is that it may have not been marked at all; making<br/>
&gt; the assumption of what it was up to the finder. <br/>
<br/>
Jeremy, I do NOT think this is the problem.  Practically every <br/>
letterbox I have ever found had an explanation inside, telling what a <br/>
letterbox is.  I personally put about half a dozen explanatory handouts <br/>
in each box for people to take with them (although these handouts are <br/>
not often taken, because most finders of boxes get their clues on the <br/>
Web at LBNA and therefore know in advance what letterboxing is all <br/>
about).<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is that people really like the stamp and simply take it.  <br/>
This particular stamp (Mount Pisgah Feldgings) is very nice and has now <br/>
been stolen twice.  My sister Betsey recarved it after it was stolen <br/>
the first time, after an article about letterboxing appeared in a local <br/>
newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
I am beginning to have mixed feelings about the value of publicity for <br/>
letterboxing!<br/>

Thanks, Bonnie. I'd like to think the Fledgings matured and moved <br/>
on.  Perhaps they'll reappear in the future as adult birds!<br/>
