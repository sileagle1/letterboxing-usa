                    <html><body>Darrin and I were once again in Goodwin State Forest, this time to pick up Chuck's remaining boxes that we somehow missed "accidentally" finding while out last weekend.  Great series and great clues!  However, Chuck.... I think it is 60 paces to the one in the apple tree, not sixty steps... but you probably have longer legs.  Maybe I should have had Darrin count the steps instead.... 
<br/>
<br/>Two of the Ants have eluded us however, one due to the early sun set (we were actually out there with out mountain bikes in the dark!) and the other due to ambiguous directions I think.... however, it could be our own stupidity (we've been known to make stupid mistakes at times!)....  Again, due to the early sunset, we were not able to get to the Bear Picnic box, but plan to try again in a few weeks, perhaps during Thanksgiving weekend when there should be plenty of time to letterbox!!!! (that is if I get my grad school term paper and power point presentation done by then!!!).
<br/>
<br/>Anyway.... great series Chuck!  Thanks!  And those Ants..... oy.... they're hard to find....!!!! (but a great series none the less.... very challenging!) :-)
