week. They are all in very good condition and are nicely hidden from <br/>
the public. The only thing is that many of the parking lots that the <br/>
directions start from charge money(from 5 to 10 bucks) for parking so <br/>
it might be better to get these from a bike or walking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great beaches and weather for all of them also<br/>
