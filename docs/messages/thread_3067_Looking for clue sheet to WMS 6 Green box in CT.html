&gt; &gt;Many  months ago, we picked up a clue sheet at the Waterford, CT EMS <br/>
&gt;store<br/>
&gt;for something called W.M.S. 6 Green Letterboxing Adventure in Goodwin<br/>
&gt;State Forest.  Turns out it is incomplete and ends with your journey is<br/>
&gt;only beginning - more on full pamphlet.No one at EMS seems to know where<br/>
&gt;the rest of the write-up is (weve asked several times).  Is there anyone<br/>
&gt;out there who knows anything about this write-up?  Or perhaps the author <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;fill us in on what happens next?<br/>

&gt;         I have a copy of the 6 Green Letterbox clues.  I also got the <br/>
&gt;clues<br/>
&gt;from EMS, but got the full pamphlet.  The rest of the clues are 3 pages<br/>
&gt;long, but if you want we could make you a copy, or fax you a copy.  Let me<br/>
&gt;know what would work for you.  Or maybe we will see you at the fair this<br/>

Val and Bill, I don't mean to sound like an old curmudgeon, but I'm <br/>
not sure about posting other people's clues without permission. There <br/>
are a bunch of letterbox cluesheets that are not "on line" for the <br/>
whole world to see, and I assume that most of them are that way on <br/>
purpose. It could be that the WMS 6 Green boxes are different, since <br/>
they were a Middle School expository writing project. They may even <br/>
be orphans...but still, I don't think they should be scanned and <br/>
posted without permission.<br/>
<br/>
Now why photocopying and sharing the old fashioned way would be any <br/>
different, I can't say, but I'm more comfortable with that. I also <br/>
have a complete cluesheet and think it's "legal" to share by sending <br/>
postal. If anyone would like one, just drop me your address off-line.<br/>

I have to agree with Jay, they aren't our clues to post!  I too will be<br/>
happy to share copies of the clues with anyone who would like them.  I will<br/>
also try to get down to EMS with a complete copy so they can restock the<br/>
entire clues.<br/>

&gt;I don't have a scanner, but maybe we could bring our copy into EMS sometime<br/>
&gt;so they can post the complete cluesheet.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;Many  months ago, we picked up a clue sheet at the Waterford, CT EMS<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;store<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;for something called W.M.S. 6 Green Letterboxing Adventure in Goodwin<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;State Forest.  Turns out it is incomplete and ends with your journey is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;only beginning - more on full pamphlet.No one at EMS seems to know where<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;the rest of the write-up is (weve asked several times).  Is there anyone<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;out there who knows anything about this write-up?  Or perhaps the author<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;can<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;fill us in on what happens next?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;     Pete &amp; Wanda,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;         I have a copy of the 6 Green Letterbox clues.  I also got the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;clues<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;from EMS, but got the full pamphlet.  The rest of the clues are 3 pages<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;long, but if you want we could make you a copy, or fax you a copy.  Let<br/>
me<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;know what would work for you.  Or maybe we will see you at the fair this<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;weekend and could give you a copy!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
