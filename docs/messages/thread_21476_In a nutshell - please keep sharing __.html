                    <div class="plaintext-content">I for one love to hear someone being excited about<br/>
letterboxing.  I love to hear about all their finds,<br/>
or the hike or the great time they all had getting<br/>
together to do drivebys.  I like the different aspects<br/>
of postal letterboxing when you can be more creative<br/>
with a logbook and box that are not going to be left<br/>
outside thus you can use different items.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I don't love to hear is someone<br/>
complaining about someone else. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not jealous about the people that live somewhere<br/>
where they are able find tons of letterboxes easily,<br/>
or the people who are able to travel and enjoy their<br/>
letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
What I like about letterboxing is that most people who<br/>
do it (and post here) feel a kinship to others.  We<br/>
like to meet and talk and interact (even if it is only<br/>
online sometimes.)<br/>
<br/>
This is the place to SHOUT about your accomplishments,<br/>
and joys and problems and all other aspects of this<br/>
hobby that you want to talk about.<br/>
<br/>
The great thing about a public Talk list is that you<br/>
can delete any topic you don't want to listen to. <br/>
<br/>
What happens all too frequently is that someone takes<br/>
a post personally and Kablam! there is chaos. <br/>
Everyone chooses a side and all heck breaks loose.<br/>
<br/>
However, sometimes the line is crossed when someone<br/>
attacks a post personally, there is no question that<br/>
they are attacking a writer more than an issue. That<br/>
is when the kinship of letterboxers shows up<br/>
abundently.  Someone is always there to stand up for<br/>
the person being berated.<br/>
<br/>
I try and stay out of all the arguments but wanted<br/>
everyone to know that I always want to hear whatever<br/>
good, bad or indifferent letterboxing "stuff" you want<br/>
to share!<br/>

Since I have joined our regional talk list there are more useful <br/>
messages and a lot less flaming.  <br/>
