Hi Mother of Crickets!  All your Scranimals boxes were safe and sound and <br/>
well hidden.  Bananaconda is a little close to the trail, but, that's never <br/>
a problem for us.  We can't even attempt to be surreptitious! We're just too <br/>
loud and active for hiding!  On the other hand, people tend to give us a <br/>
rather wide berth anyway...<br/>
<br/>
We liked the location of Bananaconda once we found the right siamese trees.  <br/>
The kids had a great time looking out at the water and the ducks.  They <br/>
didn't even fall in!  I note this because Miss Ma fell no less than five <br/>
times on the trail!  She was keeping her little hands in her pockets too <br/>
because she was chilly so she would trip over a root and plop completely <br/>
over - splat!  No hands to break the fall or anything.  It was quite awful!  <br/>
She, however, is amazingly stoic (she'll run right into a wall, bounce off <br/>
and keep going).  So, after brushing her off, she'd continue on her way.  I, <br/>
on the other hand, was a bundle of nerves waiting for her to take another <br/>
tumble (never had to wait long, unfortunately).  It got to the point where I <br/>
insisted on holding on to her elbow at all times.  Of course, then, I would <br/>
let go and pause to read the compass or the clues and -splat- over she would <br/>
go again!  I think we have pretty much given up our hopes of her getting an <br/>
athletic scholarship to Duke!...<br/>
<br/>
We found the Avocadodo after a decent search.  I saw Mary's note on the <br/>
Mangorilla saying that she hadn't found the Avocadodo.  I'm amazed that I <br/>
don't give up more often.  Thank goodness for the sighting of a glimmer of <br/>
blue Rubbermaid!  It was a tricky spot though.  I'm glad the trains weren't <br/>
running.  Miss Ma kept yelling that a train was coming.  And, even though <br/>
I'm a grown up and I read the sign for the train hours and saw that the <br/>
tunnel before the trestle was gated and padlocked - on both sides - darned <br/>
if I didn't scurry out from under that trestle every time.  What a sense of <br/>
humor for a five year old (gets it from her dad's side...)<br/>
<br/>
There was a lot of construction by the Mangorilla.  They had marked and <br/>
chopped down all sorts of trees around the area.  I'm surprised I found that <br/>
one too.  I would play with the kids on the playground and then mosey into <br/>
the woods and look around all the trees (can't help myself).  Then I would <br/>
run back to the playground in time to see Miss Ma go -splat- off the slide.  <br/>
It really was not her day!  Fortunately for me and my search, Be and Ma were <br/>
playing so loudly I had no worry that they had wandered off or been <br/>
kidnapped by someone (a recurring nightmare of a neurotic mom).  Finally, <br/>
having canvassed the areas close to the slide, I coaxed both kids into the <br/>
woods (boy, that doesn't sound good) and looked a little closer to the <br/>
construction.  There were lots of piles of sticks but we kept looking until <br/>
we finally found the right pile (with such dogged determination you would <br/>
think I was hunting for chocolate!).  Mangorilla is pretty close to the <br/>
workers.  I'd be a little worried that they might come back and load up all <br/>
their debris and take that pile with them.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts.  Uh oh -- it is eerily quiet down in the playroom.  Be and <br/>
Ma and Za are not making a sound.  Better go check it out.  That's never a <br/>
good sign!  (Da is resting upstairs with a well placed ice pack....)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this info helped!  BeMa<br/>

&gt;Dear Bema:  You're posting was great and fun to read!  I've meant to go <br/>
&gt;pull<br/>
&gt;the boxes and re-hide them as I was told the construction threatened the<br/>
&gt;Mangorilla and that the Avocadodo was missing.  How did you find them?  Was<br/>
&gt;the Avocadodo missing?  Does it look like the Mangorilla's spot might get<br/>
&gt;destroyed?  Is the Bananconda's spot still a good spot or too close to the<br/>
&gt;trail?  Mother of Crickets<br/>
