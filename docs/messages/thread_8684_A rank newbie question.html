I am just getting started and I have a question. I live in the <br/>
Shenandoah Valley.  I have found LbNA and have found only 3 boxes in <br/>
my area.  Being very close to the Shenandoah National Park I would <br/>
suspect that there are a lot more.  Are there other databases out <br/>
there?  I will place my very first box this weekend and will post <br/>
clues on Monday.  Any tips for a first-timer?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

that it can find on our web site. If you are planning to place one there<br/>
make sure the box isn't called " Shenandoah Valley " and you had better make<br/>
the clues some what difficult to figure out. NPS workers are even logging<br/>
some boxes in BLM areas here in Calif. I guess it is for future confiscation<br/>
