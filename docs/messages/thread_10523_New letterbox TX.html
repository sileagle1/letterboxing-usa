On January 26, 2003, the P-3 Letterbox was placed near Portland, San Patricio County, Texas. This box is is <br/>
hidden at the Fred Jones Nature Sanctuary, a diminutive oasis of native vegetation surrounded by a vast <br/>
expanse of agricultural development. This is a fine place to watch birds during the Spring migration.<br/>
<br/>
To reach the Sanctuary from Corpus Christi take Route 35 north and exit at Moore Avenue/FM 893 in Portland. <br/>
Turn left and head west for about six miles to the point where FM 893 makes a right angle turn. Go left here on <br/>
CR 3265. Park at the gate one half mile down this road on the left.<br/>
Once inside the Sanctuary, cross the bridge. Beneath the final plank you will find a Nimble-Pig Collaboration. <br/>
