all I see is smoke.  And the wind is absolutely ROARING.  Yesterday I <br/>
watched in horror as my neighbor's blouse &amp; panties zoomed past my <br/>

We'll go looking for the charred remains of your box after it's safe <br/>
to do so.  Should be interesting.<br/>

Why on Earth didn't you think to use a Sentry fireproof safe for <br/>
your letterboxes down in CA???  I thought you would have covered all <br/>
of your bases already!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, how much longer are you down there?  Oregon (as well as us <br/>
Northerners up here) really wants some more of your boxes...  ;)  <br/>
Hope you're having fun down there!!!<br/>

Those are a lot harder to find good hiding places for....  ;o)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Dunno.  I tend to wander a lot nowdays--with little advanced planning <br/>
to answer questions such as that.  I probably won't go back to Oregon <br/>
again until I run out of money and need to get a J-O-B.  Still can't <br/>
get myself to say that horrible word.  ;o)<br/>
