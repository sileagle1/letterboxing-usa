<br/>
Binx and I returned to MA Sunday morning on the red-eye from <br/>
Sacramento after a long wonderful week in the California sierras. <br/>
Though we apparently just missed out on a new series along I-80, we <br/>
roughly planned our week of camping/hiking around the letterboxes in <br/>
the area.<br/>
<br/>
After a great weekend camping on Lake Tahoe with friends and rafting <br/>
on the American River down in the valley, we embarked on a successful <br/>
overnight quest for "East Fork of the Carson" near Markleeville. It <br/>
was very different for us, being used to the verdant New England <br/>
woods, but very beautiful. The thunderclouds reached towards us over <br/>
the mountains all day and kept the severe heat away but yet never <br/>
came on fully. We saw a deer as well as some bear tracks on the hike <br/>
out to the heavily sedimented East Carson River. We camped in utter <br/>
solitude right on the bank of the river and found the letterbox and a <br/>
murky little hot spring pool in the morning. Our first California <br/>
letterbox was in fine shape though a bit lonely...we were the first <br/>
finders!<br/>
<br/>
After hiking back the following day, we headed south to Lee Vining to <br/>
car camp before cruising over the breathtaking Tioga pass and all the <br/>
majesty of the Yosemite Park high country. Our "short" hike to the <br/>
top of Upper Yosemite Falls for "Ahwahneechee's Rabbit Run" was <br/>
probably the toughest short hike we've ever done. It was well worth <br/>
it for the amazing views and foot-soothing natural pools on top of <br/>
the falls. Box was in fine shape.<br/>
<br/>
Facing (good) exhaustion, thunderstorms, and lack of remaining <br/>
daylight, we treated ourselves to a motel back in Lee Vining. The <br/>
next morning we found the Lundy Canyon Letterbox in the scenic canyon <br/>
north of town. We then zoomed (well...picked our way very carefully <br/>
if you must know) over the precarious Ebbit's Pass (think hairpin <br/>
turns sliding up 24% grades with no yellow lines on the road and <br/>
you'll get the picture) to seek out Utica Lake. With guidance from <br/>
the locals we took our trusty rental Toyota Corolla over two miles of <br/>
dirt road in the pouring rain to local a mystical place of two <br/>
reservoirs and huge climable domes of granite. This was probably the <br/>
prettiest place I've ever been in my life. The whirling rainclouds <br/>
and mist made the whole place appear as if out of a J.R.R. Tolkein <br/>
novel. Of course, we left our camera in the car. <br/>
<br/>
We found "New Hope" and then made it back to Bear Valley as dark came <br/>
on. We discovered the wonderful Base Camp lodge which offered <br/>
excellent food and either bunks or private rooms for very reasonable <br/>
rates and took a room, having no desire to re-cross the pass in the <br/>
night. The following day we drove up to Truckee and found "Lola's <br/>
Lookout" and "Area 51" of the Donner Pass series. Stayed with friends <br/>
in Truckee and got an early start the next morning in the <br/>
uncharacteristically cold and rainy Donner Pass. In search of "Donner<br/>
Pinecone" we hiked the Judah Loop Trail in it's entirety and must've <br/>
missed every clue due to the clouds we found ourselves in! Standing <br/>
on the cloudy summit of Mt.Judah in that windy rain of 50 degrees was <br/>
well worth the hike, however!<br/>
<br/>
We headed westwards towards the airplane ride home, stopping for a <br/>
good Mexican lunch (Cafe Delicias(?)) in Auburn with a failure to <br/>
find "Auburn Letterbox". It's probably still there but it was very <br/>
busy and hard to be inconspicuous if we indeed were searching on the <br/>
right fence. If, indeed, we guessed the correct thumb since no nail <br/>
polish was to be found! :) After two failed attempts on our last day <br/>
(supposedly our "easiest" now that we had left the mountains behind <br/>
us), we were a bit tired and discouraged but forged (and foraged) on <br/>
to find "Avery's Pond" next to Folsom Lake, picking wild blackberries <br/>
along the way. After a quick suspicious dip in the clayey waters of <br/>
Folsom (is there a beach around there somewhere?), we decided to make <br/>
for the airport to catch our late flight homewards.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all you Californian placers! We had a blast and hope to <br/>
return to the area again! See you on the trails,<br/>

Next time.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Auburn box, we've been there 4 times and have never found it, OR <br/>
the thumb nail. It's abandoned so we may never know where it was.<br/>
<br/>
You did get a lot of boxes we've never tried though! Makes me want to get in <br/>
my car right now and drive to Yosemite! thanks for the SitRep<br/>

Thanks for seeking out our box. We just returned from our camping <br/>
trip there. We just missed you by 5 days. Never experienced the lake <br/>
under those conditions, but it does sound beautiful.  We replaced the <br/>
stamp with a "authentic" stamp. We plan to change the stamp ever <br/>
year. The rock is a great place to have a picnic on sunny days, so, <br/>
you may want to make plans to visit again.<br/>
