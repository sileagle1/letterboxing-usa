  Subject: [LbNA] OT but kind of related Re: Collecting Cicada Stamps<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  As a boy growing up in North Central Texas, I spent a lot of time <br/>
  collecting cicadas.  The bugs in our area were not the 17 year <br/>
  variety as far as I know because they were out every year.  There <br/>
  were at least 3 different species that we were aware of and blue <br/>
  eyed ones were indeed rare but still around occasionally.  <br/>
