<div>I went hunting for your letterbox in Priest Point Park today.  It's 15 
minutes from my house and I've been psyched all week.  This was going to be 
my first Letterbox/Stamp.  I found the maple tree, the only one around big 
enough to hide a letter box, but it wasn't there.  I think I have the 
correct tree, I followed all the clues and the tree has a couple hollowed out 
openings facing southwesterly.  I suspect the Parks Department pulled the 
letterbox because there are signs all along the path admonishing one not to 
leave the designated path, which I had to do to get to the tree.  Anyway, I 
thought I'd let you know that I think your letterbox is gone and maybe you could 
check it out and let me know if I'm right or wrong.</div>

<br/>
The box was definitely there as of March 17th, so I'm inclined to <br/>
think it's probably still there.<br/>
<br/>
The tree is right along the trail, so you shouldn't be going off <br/>
trail to get it, so again, I suspect you're "barking up the wrong <br/>
tree".  (Sorry, couldn't resist using the expression.  *smile*)<br/>
<br/>
But it's always possible the box has gone missing in the last 13 <br/>
days, so maybe someone will be able to verify it's still there for <br/>
you.  I won't be able to--at least not for the next several months--<br/>
but perhaps someone else can.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails!<br/>
