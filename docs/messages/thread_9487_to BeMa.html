stamp, how would we alter our routine -- first child to find the box is the <br/>

in their book and the other one gets to rebury the box?....  What would a <br/>
single stamp do to this delicate dynamic?!  </blockquote><br/>
<br/>
We started out with one stamp for each member of our family.  I have since carved a "family stamp" .  When we find a box together, we stamp our family stamp.  Occasionally, my kids feel a terrific need to use their personal stamp too, so I let them.  If I'm off by myself or just one child, we use just our personal stamps.  We each have our own individual journal.  <br/>
<br/>
No matter what, they fight:  about who found what, who stamped first last time, who gets to put it back, whose turn is it to be in front, who gets to be near Daddy, your turn was longer, this box was bigger,  the color ink you stamped with is better than the color I got, you looked at the log book longer than me, etc..  (This is when I close my eyes &amp; take a breath)  We are lucky to be together, healthy and doing something wonderfully interesting.<br/>

<div>This is why I am glad I only have dogs :-) LOL They 
don't care if I have a family stamp or use theirs &amp; I'm the only one able to 
stamp in, so.... Often they do  ALL want to be in the lead though
