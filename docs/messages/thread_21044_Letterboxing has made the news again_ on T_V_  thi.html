That's not quite true -- the story did show a mile marker and the number of <br/>
steps to take from there, but then added that there were "several more <br/>
clues" that had to be followed before the box was reached. While even that <br/>
might be "too much" for some, they didn't really give "very detailed clues" <br/>
to the box.<br/>
<br/>
I did feel kinda sorry for the woman letterboxer in the story, who proudly <br/>
had her store-bought personal stamp displayed for all to see....<br/>
