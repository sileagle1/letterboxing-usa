   I wish we had gotten this map earlier ... I just took my kids at the <br/>
beginning of October all the way from Illinois to see Miss Liberty.  We <br/>
brought our letterboxing kits too (just in case) ... we attempted, <br/>
unsuccessfully, to find the boxes at Valley Forge. They were a little too <br/>
hard for a 5 &amp;  a 7 year old.  I read this to my kids and they announced that <br/>
we will have to go back.  .... Someday.... I hope the box is still there.<br/>
