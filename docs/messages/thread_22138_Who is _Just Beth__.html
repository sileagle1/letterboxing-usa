We have been letterboxing for only one year (our anniversary is this <br/>

Please, Murder!" written on the outside, and a letter of the alphabet <br/>

mystery, as I realized that this stamp was a symbol in a coded <br/>
message.  Now that I have decoded the message, I am still puzzled as <br/>
to the starting location.  Was I supposed to be able to figure it <br/>
out?  Or do I need to know who Just Beth is?  If anyone could help, <br/>
I'd certainly appreciate it!  I have no way of knowing how far from <br/>
home this HH has already travelled...<br/>
