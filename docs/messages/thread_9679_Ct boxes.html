 Hay, Connecticut boxes, there are some great new ones in the Meshomasic <br/>
State Forest planted by Pam, go get them!! Bluebird and I flew around <br/>
this morning and were the first to brave the Forest. Both Hikes are <br/>
great and her stamps are hand carved and worth the hike.!  My Favorite <br/>
was the Meshomasic State Forest Letterbox Series because I like loop <br/>
hikes. The end causes you to pay attention or be able to read your <br/>
compass. The other one is the Nostalgia Letterbox Series, and I wish it <br/>
were a loop of some sort because the trails keep on going and that makes <br/>
me want to know where they go, rather than return on the same trail. But <br/>
do go , both are great. And Thanks Pam for putting them out for us. <br/>
Seven boxes and a surprise in one is not a bad morning.!!<br/>
Happy boxing,<br/>
