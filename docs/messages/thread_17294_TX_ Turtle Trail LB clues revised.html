Turtle Trail Letterbox Series in Harker Heights, TX--the clues have <br/>
been revised (these revisions are circa Apr 03 timeframe).  Please <br/>
ensure you have the newest clues before you venture out.  You can <br/>
reach the clues here:<br/>

Enjoy!  Unfortunately, I am unable to verify the status of these <br/>
letterboxes as I live 2,000 miles from them.  The placer of the <br/>
series is also unable to check on them currently, however, the clues <br/>
are still posted for anybody interested in looking for them--<br/>
otherwise, the clues would have been file 13d.  Hopefully, with the <br/>
advent of the New Year the 'mother' of this series will be able to <br/>
pay them a visit in the near future.<br/>
