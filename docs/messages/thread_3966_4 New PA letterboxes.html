Description:  Walking conditions vary from groomed foot paths to remote<br/>
hiking trails<br/>
Time:  Allow approx. 1 Hour<br/>
Peace Valley Nature Center, Bucks County, PA<br/>
Nearest Town:  Between Dublin and Doylestown<br/>
Directions:  Route 313 turning onto New Galena Road-Peace Valley Nature<br/>
Center.  Continue down New Galena and turn left onto Chapman Road.  Park<br/>
in the area on the left.<br/>
<br/>
Begin on Lake Walk behind the Solar Building, a natural carpeted trail.<br/>
Stop and enjoy the "Butterfly Field".  Can you hear the weeping willows<br/>
up the walk?  Don't worry they'll be fine so continue on Lake Walk<br/>
staying on the correct side of the "Keep out" sign.  This walk leads to<br/>
the edge of Lake Galena.  From the open meadow to the cover of trees<br/>
begin to follow the white blazes of the Maple Leaf Trail.  At what<br/>
resembles a dry creek bed stop and look to the right.  Remnants of an<br/>
old stonewall are left standing.  Make your way up the creek bed<br/>
stopping at the skinny tree just at the edge at the right bend.  From<br/>
that tree proceed 8 paces at 34 degrees finding "Peace in the Valley" in<br/>
the wall.  Return to the Maple Leaf Trail leading towards an<br/>
intersection.  Take a Southwesterly direction on the West Woods Trail<br/>
for another look at the lake.  Just ahead turn onto the Red Oak Trail up<br/>
and under the trees again following the white blazes to a familiar<br/>
intersection.  This time head Northeasterly on the WWTrail.  Before<br/>
crossing the small gorge look ahead for the white arrow pointing the way<br/>
on the other side.  Sooner, rather than later more remains of a<br/>
stonewall can be spotted on the left side of the trail.  Look to the<br/>
right side for "Sunrise Trek" in the stonewall.  Its exact location can<br/>
be found by looking through the space between side by side trees.  The<br/>
part of the wall that is visible between the trees is where you should<br/>
look.  To finish the loop go past the downed trees to the "Honey Locust"<br/>
meadow on the Sunrise Trek.  Skip the "Hill" and stay on the Trek to see<br/>
the most spectacular evergreens ever.  There's not a Charlie Brown tree<br/>
in the bunch.  At the directional sign take a left to join the mini loop<br/>
back to the parking area.<br/>
