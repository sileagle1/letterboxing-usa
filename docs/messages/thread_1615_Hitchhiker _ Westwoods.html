<div>Dan and I went out to Westwoods yesterday for an awesome day of 
letterboxing.  I was psyched because Westwoods is one of my favorite places 
to hike in CT.  While we were there we not only found the Drew's boxes and 
the new Dinosaurs Before Dark box, but we also found a new hitchhiker that we 
didn't even know existed!  It is the Magic Tree House Hitchhiker left by 
the Kurdziels (the same family that made the dinosaur box).  Our lucky 
day!!!  We were shocked though that the Westwoods boxes had very few 
visitors.  For those of you in SE CT I would highly recommend this hike it 
is terrific.  To the Kurdziels:  Your spot was so cool.  We 
really felt like we were being transported back to the ages of the 
dinosaurs!</div>
