Box Name is The Eagle<br/>
Placed March 2002<br/>
PA <br/>
<br/>
Clue:<br/>
<br/>
Right above a mid sized town in South <br/>
Eastern PA stands an oriental folly.  <br/>
After following the race course<br/>
(Duryea Hill climb)<br/>
Investigate the stalwart structure<br/>
Now, proceed along the course I'm<br/>
Going to describe to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Foolish fellows find the folly's Roman features <br/>
 - (gift shop level) and enumerate them.<br/>
Walking, driving, biking hiking off we go along the crest.<br/>
You must pass a little airfield - all in roundels on the right<br/>
Continue till you reach a most impressive structure <br/>
Towering over hill and dale.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Standing at the SW corner of the structure. With a compass sight 238.<br/>
Now descend the stairs, counting as you go.<br/>
Cross the road. Just the other side of the low wall you will see a drainage<br/>
Culvert.<br/>
(Large Cement box with 2 manholes)<br/>
Standing on the Box with the Tower at your back you should be on an azimuth<br/>
of 238 <br/>
Now you are going to take how many steps?  Add the number of - what were<br/>
those Roman features - to double the number of risers you just came down.<br/>
Walk to the Dark Barked Y shaped tree. Under the rocks on the east side and<br/>
Eagle makes its nest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NOTE:  Most of this is easy and drivable however after you go off trail you<br/>
should be careful of your footing. Be careful of the loose rocks.<br/>
<br/>
