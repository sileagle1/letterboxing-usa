So glad you had a good day and I hope you remember the camera on the <br/>
trip back.  Question: did your dog go to Cantine Field? Were the <br/>
directions to the park clear?  Did you try the slide? :)<br/>
<br/>
Also about North Lake: You may want to check to see if they have <br/>
opened yet...not sure on this.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">phynstar - What a day!  Today was even nicer than Saturday. Your<br/>
directions to the park are great.  The sort cut through Saugerties on<br/>
Finger street is definitely the best way to go from that side of town. We<br/>
left late yesterday  because we intended to leave our dog Bud home when<br/>
we explored this LB so he was outside all day  until  we left. Each<br/>
weekend we do our shopping on Saturday before the stores close at 6pm so<br/>
we did not have that much time to explore the park but we had been to<br/>
that park years ago and forgot how nice a place it is. Each  Sunday we<br/>
set aside to hike somewheres locally. This year our family's are<br/>
scattered about and we decided to spend the day again up to the North<br/>
Lake area. This is about our 4th time up there over the past 4 months.<br/>
The park is open to the public with no facilities open and no park<br/>
rangers there yet. Its a free for all during the off season.  All winter<br/>
long the park is open to xcounty,hikers,showshoers,snow mobilers,ice<br/>
fishing......When the snow is real deep, and it was several feet this<br/>
winter, they plow to the top gate and parking area. Later on they plow to<br/>
the bottom of the Lakes. We have been going there for years in the<br/>
Winter. So we hiked to Boulder Rock today.  More about Boulder Rock<br/>
later.  That was our goal for the day. We brought Bud with us and he did<br/>
the entire hike without any problems. Not bad for a blind dog! We met a<br/>
couple and their son from Germany along the way and shared the LB website<br/>
info with them. (He had actually climbed on top of Boulder Rock and said<br/>
there were markings from 1912 enscribed in the stone there.)   Got some<br/>
nice digital photos which I have to reduce in size inorder to send out<br/>
later on. Got to go...... Best regards    From the "budster"  &amp; J&amp;G<br/>
