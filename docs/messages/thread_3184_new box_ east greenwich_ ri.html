Crossways Crossed Paths Letterbox<br/>
East Greenwich, Rhode Island<br/>
<br/>
Placed by CZF and CSCM on 20010804.<br/>
<br/>
This is a drive-up letterbox with fairly easy clues.<br/>
<br/>
Background<br/>
<br/>
Crossways is an East Greenwich neighborhood named for a farm that once<br/>
operated<br/>
there.  The first farmhouse, known as the "White House," was built on the<br/>
property in 1772 by Christopher Spencer.  The land stayed in the hands of the<br/>
Spencer family until 1835, when it was purchased by Ludowick Updike<br/>
Shippee.  It<br/>
was under his ownership that the property was dubbed "Crossways Farm."<br/>
 The farm<br/>
has since been subdivided and sold off in residential lots, but its name<br/>
survives on maps and in memories.  The names of Spencer and Shippee likewise<br/>
adorn local roads and corners.  A large chunk of the farm is now East<br/>
Greenwich<br/>
Historical Cemetery #26.<br/>
<br/>
Directions<br/>
<br/>
1.   From Route 95 south take exit 9 to Route 4 south.<br/>
2.   Then take exit 8, which will come up very quickly.  At the end of<br/>
the ramp<br/>
turn right onto Division Street (Route 401).<br/>
3.   Drive 1.7 miles and take a right onto Kenyon Avenue.<br/>
4.   Drive 0.3 miles to an intersection with Cedar Avenue.<br/>
5.   Cross the intersection and enter the place where the dead reside.  Keep<br/>
right and proceed slowly.<br/>
6.   Park near the stone that makes fun of you.<br/>
7.   Look for an elaborately carved cross nearby.<br/>
8.   From the front of the cross, walk at 220 degress, past the horses dancing<br/>
with a star, to the tallest manicured evergreen you can see.<br/>
9.   Carefully reach inside the shrub to claim your prize.<br/>
<br/>
When you've finished stamping up, please be sure to rewrap and replace the box<br/>
so that it cannot easily be seen by casual observers.<br/>
