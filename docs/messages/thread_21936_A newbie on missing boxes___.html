I just started letterboxing recently here in the Boston area. I love <br/>
following the clues, especially if they are a little cryptic. The other <br/>
great feature is that I end up finding all these wonderful little <br/>
forest preserves I never knew about! So I always enjoy the exploration. <br/>
The problem is, out of the 5 letterboxes I have found, 3 were missing - <br/>
I only knew they had been there because someone else left a note, or <br/>
there was some remnant of the box. I always email the placer if <br/>
possible. <br/>
<br/>
Is this a really common thing? do people just search for ones that are <br/>
really new? <br/>

Hi Andy,<br/>
Unfortunately some letterbox placers don't update clues or maintain <br/>
their boxes. Not finding a letterbox is part of the game. Are you <br/>
sure you read the clues properly? You might want to go to a <br/>
reagional list and ask specificly if those letterboxes are viable.<br/>

<br/>
It's always disappointing when a box is missing.  There's also no way<br/>
that we can track all of our letterboxes steadily.  It's helpful when<br/>
someone posts the info on this list so that we know what's happened.<br/>
<br/>
Although there's a slightly greater likelihood that an older box will<br/>
be missing, as compared with a newer box, it's never a "sure thing"<br/>
even with a newer box.  Location, exposure to the elements, and how<br/>
collectible the original stamp is... all of them can be factors in how<br/>
soon a box is damaged or vanishes.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, I figure that I'm getting outdoors, having a great time, and a<br/>
certain percentage--for me, maybe 20 - 30%--of the boxes will be<br/>
missing or the clues will be too obscure for me to figure out.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in the Boston area, I looked for a box at the DeCordova<br/>
grounds in Lincoln, MA about three or four times before someone<br/>
pointed out that I was making a very wrong turn at one point.  On my<br/>
next visit, bingo, I found the box easily.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I often carry replacement supplies--even complete letterboxes,<br/>
sometimes--when I'm hiking.  I've replaced logbooks, stamp pads,<br/>
pencils, and even the container itself, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
There will always be disappointments on the trail, but the victories<br/>
usually offset them.<br/>
<br/>
Just let us know which boxes appear to be missing, so we can update<br/>
our clue lists.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>

not that the "big list" isn't wonderful it just might help with <br/>
specific boxes in boston.<br/>
if I cant find a box. I email the placer..although not all placers <br/>
will respond. People who have been to the box or know about it might <br/>
be able to help.<br/>
good luck and welcome to boxing<br/>

On the other hand, a lot of times the newer boxes are placed by newbies, and<br/>
may not be as carefully hidden. In our area, I have better luck with older<br/>
boxes than newer boxes.<br/>

Actually, it has been my impression that many folks in new england tend to <br/>
make an extra effort to search for those boxes that are older on purpose. For <br/>
one, those are some of the first boxes ever placed (by people such as The <br/>
Vermont Viking, DrewClan, Legerdemaine, etc etc) and those clues have <br/>
become harder and harder to come across and thus, the box(es) are more <br/>
treasured. <br/>
<br/>
So, I personally go out of my way to search for those older clues, un-<br/>
published, wom and older boxes and clues that are quite rewarding little <br/>
treasures of letterboxing history if you will.<br/>
