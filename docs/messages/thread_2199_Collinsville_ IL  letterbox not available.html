  Sorry you had no luck finding those two letterboxes.  I've posted a note a <br/>
couple times about those two boxes being unavailable but the web masters have <br/>
been understandably busy.  The store owner gave Across the Board back to me <br/>
to plant it elsewhere on Main Street.  I hope you were able to find the other <br/>
three letterboxes on Main Street in Collinsville and elsewhere around town?  <br/>
I know that all but Keebler Kitten are accessible ....a railroad tie cave in <br/>
buried that one I'm afraid.<br/>
<br/>
