than finding some of my clues on the Internet while doing a Google <br/>
search for an unrelated topic.<br/>
<br/>
Typically, that's not a problem, but sometimes you'd rather not have <br/>
non-letterboxers finding your clues.  For those of you that put clues <br/>
on your own website, there IS a way to prevent the clue from showing <br/>
up in most search engine results.  Two steps:<br/>
<br/>
One: Never have any links that link directly to your clue.  If <br/>
nothing links to your clue, search engines can't find it.  In Google, <br/>
you can even find out what pages link to your website by <br/>
typing "link:http://www.geocities.com/rscarpen/Lb" (put your own <br/>
website URL instead of mine) in their search box.  VERY fascinating!  <br/>
VERY cool!  =)  But people visiting these sites are pointing search <br/>
engines (and people) to your clues.  Imagine how surprising it was <br/>
for me to see my website listed on a website about "Prison Tatoos".  <br/>
Bizarre.  I have a hunch most people following that link will be <br/>
sorely disappointed with my website!<br/>
<br/>
Second: You can include the following line of text in the header <br/>
(i.e. betwen the '<head>' and '</head>' tags):<br/>
<br/>
<meta contents="noindex,nofollow" name="robots"/><br/>
<br/>
This tells search engines not to index that webpage, nor follow any <br/>
of the links that lead off of it.<br/>
<br/>
Between those two steps, your clue should be more-or-less <br/>
inaccessible to any accidental visitors.<br/>

Carpe diem!  =)<br/>
