&gt; I had a first today - I found TWO hitchhikers in one box!  WOO <br/>
HOO!  Die Uber <br/>
&gt; Frau and World Domination have both hopped into my hiking bag.  I <br/>
found them <br/>
&gt; both in The Turtle's "Take Me to the Stars" box in Columbia, MD.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then as I walked back to my car, I found a Psychomommy walking down <br/>
the path! <br/>
&gt;  Another great surprise!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am hoping to hit 100 tomorrow.  I may come within one box <br/>
anyways!    And <br/>
&gt; while I try, I will find new homes for the two hitchhikers.  Maybe <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; should stay together.  Maybe Die Uber Frau is plotting World <br/>
Domination!  <br/>
&gt; Maybe they should be separated so that she can't succeed in her <br/>
evil plot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the meantime, I am trying to convince her to bake me some <br/>
cookies!<br/>
