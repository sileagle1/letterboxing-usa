Yesterday we were off boxing in Red Rocks Park just west of Denver.  <br/>
As I was waiting to head to the next box I noticed a gentleman <br/>
parked in a handicap spot next to us that looked like he had some <br/>
sort of disability that required him to walk with a cane, if you can <br/>
call it walking (if you know what I mean).  He did get back in his <br/>
car and just sat there.  A few minutes later another car pulled up <br/>
next to him on the other side and a guy jumped out with a couple of <br/>
plastic grocery bags.  He threw one in his back seat and the other <br/>
he took with him as he jumped into the passanger seat of the car <br/>
between us.  I saw him pull a sandwich bag out of the grocery bag <br/>
stuffed with what looked very much like marijuana.  A few moments <br/>
later he jumped out, opened the back door of the car, pulled up the <br/>
back seat cushion, tossed in the bag, put the seat back down, and <br/>
got back in the front.  I am 99% sure that this was a drug deal but <br/>
I froze.  I even had a cell phone that I could have called the <br/>
cops.  I easily could have written down the license plate numbers <br/>
but did not.  I was there with my wife and two young kids and was <br/>
not sure what to do.  So my question to you is....What would you <br/>
have done?<br/>

Given all the details you mention, doing nothing at that moment was probably the best <br/>
option.  Now that you are away from the location, I would report it to authorities for them <br/>
to monitor future transactions.<br/>
<br/>
A notice placed in clues to caution others would be nice.<br/>

I think that I would have taken down all the info and when I was away <br/>
from the area I would call and report it.  I have small children and <br/>
who is to say that this person might one day be responsible for my <br/>
children or other children to get their hands on drugs.  Also, whose <br/>
to say that this guy won't drive under the influence and possibly <br/>
kill or terribly maime a you or a member of your family.  I know I <br/>
would have had to call the info in after I left the area.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
I live in Santa Cruz, CA. A pot deal is nothing. Heck, our county<br/>
faced down the DEA over our right to not enforce marijuana possession<br/>
laws.<br/>
<br/>
We call it in when we see people smoking something other than pot--<br/>
like crack, for example (we saw that one in the parking lot before<br/>
work.... there's a middle school 2 blocks away). But pot? No way.<br/>
Especially not if the buyer was handicapped-- it's almost certainly<br/>
medicinal.<br/>
<br/>
I know Colorado has a mix of conservative and liberal idealogies, but<br/>
if I'm not mistaken, it's very much a "live and let live" kind of<br/>
culture. Unless this deal was going on in front of a school, I'd<br/>
personally just ignore it. Or make a joke with my husband. Or walk<br/>
away, as it's none of my business.<br/>
<br/>
Since your kids were there, this does pose the perfect opportunity to<br/>
talk to them about drugs, however, and why people do them, if they're<br/>
old enough to even understand that anything odd had happened.<br/>

You cannot put yourself or your family at risk by doing anything <br/>
while they are in view.  That is the job for the cops.  You can be <br/>
the eyes and ears for the cops.  I would write down all your <br/>
observations and license plate numbers.  When you are away from the <br/>
area, call it in and let the police do their job.<br/>

Since the question has been posed "what would you have done?" and not<br/>
"what should I have done?" I will answer it as such: "I" would have<br/>
examined their cars for political bumper stickers. If their political<br/>
viewpoints differed from mine, I would have called the cops. If their<br/>
political viewpoints were the same as mine, I would have done nothing<br/>
(except leave). If I couldn't tell what their political views were at<br/>
all I would have done nothing (unless I distinctly heard country music<br/>
emanating from their cars, at which point I would call the cops;<br/>
because I can't stand country music). Before anyone chooses to be<br/>
offended, Note that I did not state my political viewpoints, and<br/>
remember the wording of the question. <br/>

"what should I have done?" I will answer it as such: "I" would have<br/>
examined their cars for political bumper stickers. If their political<br/>
viewpoints differed from mine, I would have called the cops. If their<br/>
political viewpoints were the same as mine, I would have done nothing<br/>
(except leave). If I couldn't tell what their political views were at<br/>
all I would have done nothing (unless I distinctly heard country music<br/>
emanating from their cars, at which point I would call the cops;<br/>
because I can't stand country music). Before anyone chooses to be<br/>
offended, Note that I did not state my political viewpoints, and<br/>
remember the wording of the question. <br/>

I like this line of thinking.   Based on the short time I've come to be <br/>
acquainted with American culture, I could set up a system of that sort for myself.  <br/>
<br/>
If they were Cubs fans, I'd leave 'em alone.  If they were Sox fans, I'd call <br/>
da cops.<br/>
<br/>
If they were Bears fans, I'd leave 'em alone.  If they were Packers fans, I'd <br/>
call da cops.<br/>
<br/>
If they were drivin' old chevy junks, I'd leave 'em alone.  Hummers?  I'd <br/>
call da cops.  Pick-up truck?  Leave 'em alone.  Lexus?  Call da cops.<br/>
<br/>
If they had a bumper sticker on a pickup truck proclaiming "My coondawg is <br/>
smarter than your honour student," I'd definitely leave 'em alone.  Because <br/>
there's a chance they've got a conveniently reachable gun rack in that there <br/>
pickup.  <br/>
<br/>
But no matter where I drew my personal line, if they were fellow boxers, I'd <br/>
make dang sure to get that exchange before the squads show up.  That's <br/>
something I'd be sure to do.<br/>
