I have planted Box 1 and Box 2 of the State Welcome Series that I am working on. They are: Texas Welcome and Louisiana Welcome. Both on IH-10, at the Texas-Louisiana border. <br/>
I also relocated the Tall Pine LB that I planted in Claiborne Park. I realized that I had put it too deep into the woods. So, now it has a home closer in. <br/>
So, if y'all come down IH-10 Texas/Louisiana way, (southeast Texas/southwest Louisiana) stop in for some boxes. <br/>
<br/>
I started boxing on 7/13/2003 and have planted 3 boxes and found the following:<br/>
<br/>
Spindletop--Very nice stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Bozo Hitchhiker-- My first one! Picked up at Spindletop and released already.<br/>
<br/>
Pepe Le Texan--another nice stamp and the park is great. <br/>
<br/>
Sea Rim Gator--again a nice stamp and the box survived Hurricane Claudette, however the beach was a mess!<br/>
<br/>
Battleship Texas--Very nice. This is a good box and a nice park to visit.<br/>
<br/>
San Jacinto--this was a good one. The hardest one I have had yet. Course once I was on the right road it was much easier! So much for carefully reading the clues. Excitement got in the way!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoyed looking at all the stamps in the books. There were more than I expected. Even some from Rhode Island in the Sea Rim Gator. <br/>
<br/>
This is a great sport! <br/>
