It is very easy if you have a website of your own that you are linking to, but must also be easy if you are just cutting and pasting your own clues . . . and, if you mess it up, like I did the first time, you just edit it until you get it right - it all happens in real time - instantaneously.  I don't know who Wes is, the person who came up with this new site, but someone should buy him a drink.<br/>
<br/>
Ours is the only one transferred over from Hampton Roads so the rest of you get on it and give Trish some much needed rest.<br/>
