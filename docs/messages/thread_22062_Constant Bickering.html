<br/>
I think it would be a whole lot more pleasant, and easier to read for <br/>

LBing.  Who said what, or how, or when or whatever is really not so <br/>

sure no one means to hurt anyone's feelings, but when you publicly <br/>

appropriate?<br/>
<br/>
Basically, it just seems like everyone is angry about something at <br/>
some point or another.  The LBers that I have met in person don't <br/>

the list.  My point?  There's got to be a way to keep peace on the <br/>
chat list.<br/>

Again, I didn't mean to offend anyone.  I just needed to get this out <br/>
