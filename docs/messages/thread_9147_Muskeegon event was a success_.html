<div>The gathering we had in Muskegon Michigan for 
Letterboxing &amp; Geocaching was a big success! There were 9 or 10 people in 
attendance (depending on the day) &amp; all brought at least one furry, 
four-legged companion. Most arrived on Friday and we settled into the 
hotel. Several people had a long drive (including 2 people from Florida!), but 
we still ended up staying up late chatting. :-) On Saturday, Sheila ("Puppy 
Love") gave an extensive &amp; very informative lecture about Geocaching, then 
we played a game to test our skill with a GPS. After lunch, everyone (but me) 
went to look for geocaches. I stayed behind at the hotel to hide some 'hitch 
hikers' as practice finds for everyone the following day. I also took a nap so I 
wouldn't be a total zombie the next day. :-). That evening, we went back to the 
meeting room &amp; ate a wonderful casserole provided by Diane ("MommaDi") and a 
7 layer salad provided by Kat ("Potak") &amp; some pizza. Then we played more 
games. On Sunday, I (SCOUTDOGS) did a presentation on Letterboxing that was cut 
a bit short because they had another group coming in to use the room at 11am. 
During lunch, everyone searched for the hitch hikers I placed the day before at 
the hotel. All were found &amp; will be traveling to many new places. I'll list 
them &amp; their cities of destination in another email. Then it was off to 
Letterbox! Lonnie &amp; Saikou ("Dog is my co-pirate"), Kat &amp; 
Chelsea("potak") &amp; myself with Coyote went to Hofma park to attempt to 
conquer the "Words in the woods" series. We started with Beautiful Things. It 
had rained the night before &amp; the clues mentioned the area was boggy, but we 
didn't have any trouble. After the tricky water crossing, and a brief search, we 
found the box in good condition. Very nice stamp &amp; log book! Then we picked 
up the clues from the asterisk to find 'A Kind of Summer'. We thought we had 
followed them to the conclusion, but then found the 'bench' that was mentioned. 
So we started over &amp; think we found the spot the box was supposed to be, but 
no box :-(  We then went to find Beauty of Dreams. Thanks to my "Shortcut" 
which ended up fruitless, causing more mileage &amp; putting us on the trail 
backwards, we did end up finding this one :-) After Lonnie razzed me a bit about 
my choice of routes, my new nickname is "Shortcut"! (Just kidding) :-) We 
decided to drive up to Sleeper St. &amp; look for the "New Lands" box. This was 
Lonnie's first find (done without me saying "I found it! There it is!" LOL) From 
here, we looked for the floating bridge geocache &amp; just as we were ready to 
give up, Lonnie found it! It was getting late &amp; we had dinner plans, so we 
left this really beautiful park. Not bad for Lonnie &amp; Kat's first day 
letterboxing! We went to a spaghetti dinner that was a fund raiser for the lung 
transplant needed for the husband of one of our troop members. We were all 
tired, so we got to bed fairly early. On Monday, some of our group had to leave, 
but others stayed to letterbox. I went boxing with Diana ("MommaDi"). She wasn't 
able to make it to the event on Sat or Sun (except to deliver dinner), so I gave 
her a crash course in boxing &amp; off we went! For her first box, we went to 
"Ghosts Below". She squealed with delight when she found it with very 
little help (if any) from me &amp; was rewarded with not only her first ever 
find, but also being 'first finder' for this box (since it was only placed last 
weekend). It's a mystery box &amp; Diana said solving the clues was fun! From 
there, we went to the Grand Haven Lighthouse. When we got to the parking lot, we 
met up with Lonnie, Joanne ("Wet Dog Willie"), Kat &amp; Ginger ("Jax n' 
Ginge"). They had just found the lighthouse &amp; Chinook Pier, so we went our 
separate ways &amp; found the boxes on our own. "MommaDi" lives in Muskegon, and 
hadn't carved her signature stamps yet, so she said she would do that first 
before she signed in to these boxes. </div>
<div>I do believe we have several new letterboxing 
junkies as a result of this weekend. :-) </div>
<div>I will post more on the boxes others in our group 
found, as soon as they let me know which boxes they found (or didn't find) &amp; 
their condition. </div>
