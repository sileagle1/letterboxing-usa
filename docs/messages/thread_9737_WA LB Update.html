**Found Kenneydell in perfect health hanging out around Black Lake.  <br/>
What a gem of a park &amp; a great swimming hole for some cool dudes, <br/>
too!<br/>
<br/>
**Pt Defiance Park's athletic series is doing well.  What a <br/>
challenge when your brain is tired!!!  ;)<br/>
<br/>
**Psyco's dancing with Bigfoot.<br/>
<br/>
**Launched HH "yoU. F.O.und it!" this week.<br/>
<br/>
**Launched HH "Groovy Bug" this week in Ohio!  (Long story about <br/>
finding the perfect permanent hiding space for it &amp; then learning it <br/>
wasn't very welcome there--it debuts somewhere else around Ohio soon)<br/>
<br/>
**We're on the last page of our little logbook!!!  :(  We're in for <br/>
a change!!!  ;)<br/>

Is that the same series as the Pt Defiance Sports Series?  Because if <br/>
so, I'd love to know if you found the "I've Got An Eye For You" HH <br/>
which I placed in one of them many moons ago, or have any information <br/>
about where it might have gone after I hid it there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

PS. I think an Amazing Race stamp needs to go in Lincoln Park.  *hint <br/>

Yes, it was the same series but the HH wasn't there.  There had been <br/>
several visitors to it between your stamp and mine in the logs that <br/>
I can't remember who should've grabbed it.  I think some long <br/>
distance visitors had visited so perhaps it's made its way to <br/>
distant shores--VA or TX possibly?  Hopefully, it'll pop up in a <br/>
spotrep sometime soon.<br/>
