I've noticed that from time to time yahoo group posting slows down to a<br/>
pathetically painfully slow pace.  Those times usually correspond with a big<br/>
virus threat.  I would imagine that with this latest worm going around, and<br/>
the fact that it targets yahoo addresses, yahoo is all but hand-sorting<br/>
email messages.<br/>
<br/>
Or it could be that someone is screening all your mail before it can be<br/>
posted (   ;^) - J/K.  )<br/>

Yahoo's been horribly slow today and I suspect others are right that they're dealing with <br/>
this "graphic site" virus. (I've deleted a bunch of messages with that subject line from the <br/>
moderation queue today alone.) Let's hope things speed up soon.<br/>
