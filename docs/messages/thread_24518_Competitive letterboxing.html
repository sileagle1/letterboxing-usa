I do letter box with two other people and we do keep count of how many letter boxes, we do it to set goals for ourselves like by the end of summer let's see about getting the stamp count to 200. We also log the name, city location, and date of the letter boxes we find  but again that is mostly for us to look at. We have had the occasional question of what was your favorite letter box. At that point we start flipping through the book and pointing out the ones we liked or found the clues to be really good. But since I do letter box with two other people I always walk away enjoying the experience because we all talk, goof off, and generally have a great time while looking for letter boxes. Plus we get outside and in a since have something to do instead sitting inside and just hanging out. <br/>

<br/>
I don't suppose it was the original intent of letterboxing to be 'competitive' and sometimes wonder if this relatively recently acquired aspect is not the reason I see so many boxes lately that are carelessly sealed and, in several cases, left completely in the open or hidden so poorly that they may as well be left out it the open.  It would be such a shame if people were to lose the 'timelessness' of the hobby for the sake of 'box count.'  <br/>
