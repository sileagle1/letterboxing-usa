<br/>
FOX IN BOX LETTERBOX, BELLEVILLE, MICHIGAN<br/>
<br/>
General Information<br/>
<br/>
Location: Lower Huron MetroPark, Belleville, Michigan, half way <br/>
between Detroit and Ann Arbor. You will need to take a look at <br/>
the map on my Web site to get started.<br/>
Clues: Easy, but beware false leads!<br/>
Level: Easy; good for young and old alike!<br/>

<br/>
Would you like a box containing a fox,<br/>
Or stones and bones and one or two rocks?<br/>
<br/>
     I would like a box containing a fox,<br/>
     A furry and fuzzy and cuddly fox.<br/>
     But stones and bones and several rocks!<br/>
     That's not a treasure to hide in a box!<br/>
<br/>
Do you like walking in the woods,<br/>
Or eating Spam and clam tinned goods?<br/>
<br/>
     Yes, I like walking in the woods,<br/>
     One should and could walk in the woods.<br/>
     But Spam and ham and clam tinned goods!<br/>
     There are better, better, better foods!<br/>
<br/>
Do you like water from a font,<br/>
Or ghosties and beasties and creatures that haunt?<br/>
<br/>
     I do like water from a font,<br/>
     One lonely, solitary font.<br/>
     But ghosties and beasties and creatures that haunt!<br/>
     There are better things that one might want!<br/>
<br/>
Do you like pointing at the trees<br/>
At two-hundred-and-fifty degrees*?<br/>
<br/>
     Yes, I like pointing at the trees,<br/>
     I sometimes sneeze from all the trees!<br/>
     But with my nose I'll do as I please<br/>
     And I'll walk toward two-fifty degrees!<br/>
<br/>
Do you like walking in silly races<br/>
Of one-hundred-and-sixteen short-legged paces**?<br/>
<br/>
     One-hundred-and-sixteen short-legged paces<br/>
     Are really and truly my kind of races!<br/>
     And walking and talking in forested spaces,<br/>
     And taking advantage of nature's good graces.<br/>
<br/>
Paces you've counted have brought you to where<br/>
The box with the fox is really quite near!<br/>
<br/>
     Yes, it really and truly was so very near!<br/>
     At first it wasn't so terribly clear<br/>
     But I poked and I prodded without any fear,<br/>
     And a box with a fox I've found hidden here!<br/>
<br/>
*   All readings are magnetic<br/>
**  116  of my paces (I am short)  a pace is a single footfall.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
