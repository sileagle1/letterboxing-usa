intriguing, but only if a small percentage of letterboxers practice <br/>
it.  If nobody exchanged, I guess it would be intriguing if a few did.<br/>
<br/>
In Texas, we have a letterboxer with a similar persuasion, only <br/>
instead of being a famous letterboxer with an unidentified personal <br/>
stamp, this person was an unknown letterboxer with a known personal <br/>
stamp and trail name.  This was possible since they stamped into <br/>
boxes all over TX, but did not belong to any List or have any boxes <br/>
placed, so could remain under the radar.  Now there are many people <br/>
that fit this description, but this person was unique because they <br/>
were almost always first finder of any box, no matter what part of <br/>
the state, obviously willing to drive many miles at the drop of a <br/>
hat.  It became quite an obsession with us on the TX Talklist to meet <br/>
this mystery letterboxer, to the point we even set boxes out as <br/>
bait.  It was bittersweet when we finally "caught" this boxer; <br/>
exciting &amp; pleasurable to meet such an interesting person, but a <br/>
little sad that the mystery was over.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I don't exchange at all.  The personal stamp is to remain secret.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do have a non-personal, non-traveler, non-anything that I<br/>
&gt; will use for exchanges when it is less of a hassle to use that<br/>
&gt; than explain my opinion on this to the other person :)<br/>

Great story (except the bittersweet end!)  Did anyone in the boxing <br/>
community know this person before his secret identity was "outed".  I <br/>
wish I could race all over the state (and I would have considerably <br/>
less ground to cover than in Texas!) for a box.  Maybe that's what I'll <br/>
do once my children run off to college?  Oh, the places I could <br/>
go...the people I could meet...and the stories my children could tell <br/>
about their crazy mom... ;)<br/>

<br/>
Nobody knew him at all, and in fact, no one still REALLY knows him!  You<br/>
know how you eventually learn boxer's real names as well as their trail<br/>
names over time?  And you pretty much know at the very least where they are<br/>
from?  Two years down the road, and no one still knows his real name, or<br/>
even what town he actually resides in.  We know his profession (he's a<br/>
semi-retired attorney) and a few details about his personal life (he has<br/>
dogs, loves high school football, has family around the state).  We know<br/>
what he drives (a cranberry colored PT cruiser) - which I guess is the only<br/>
real bona fide fact we know about the man, and that because it is the car he<br/>
drives to gatherings.  He is entirely charming and gentlemanly, eloquent,<br/>
and a pleasure to spend time with.  The kids love him and he is a total<br/>
cootie magnet, which he doesn't seem to mind at all.<br/>
<br/>
He taunts us by doing things like leaving boxes in people's front yards(this<br/>
may sound a little freakish, but he had made arrangements with the other<br/>
boxer to return a box to yet another boxer through her, and he made the<br/>
hand-off quite simple by planting it and then emailing her the clues, which<br/>
led her to her own front yard), and yet we can't even determine the county<br/>
he lives in so we could leave a box.<br/>
<br/>
How did we finally bust him?  Well - it was only because he let us bust<br/>
him!  I hosted a small gathering a couple of years ago and to make life<br/>
easier, my family camped out at the gathering site.  The purpose of the<br/>
gathering was to plant up a boxless area, so in the spirit of the event<br/>
everyone planned to bring and leave a box.  Because it was small, we planned<br/>
to host the gathering in our campsite, so we posted on the local list where<br/>
we would be found.  When I got up on Saturday morning, there was a camo'd<br/>
letter-sized envelope on our picnic table with handwriting I recognized even<br/>
without my contacts in - it was from him!!!  I scrambled to put my lenses in<br/>
and read the note.  It told us to open the envelope at 3:00 p.m. - the time<br/>
the gathering was to begin.  My son and I worried ourselves to death over<br/>
that envelope all day, and my husband reminded us periodically that the<br/>
first point of the Scout Law is "A Scout is Trustworthy...", something we<br/>
really wanted to forget that day.  Finally, we put it up and out of sight<br/>
and went to plant our own box.  When we returned to our site, folks were<br/>
starting to show up, so I showed them the envelope and we all counted down<br/>
to 3:00.  At the designated time, we opened the envelope and there they were<br/>
- copies of carefully written, perfectly unintelligible clues!  He had left<br/>
us a box, but in cipher!  And worse, they were in the same cipher we had<br/>
been trying to solve for months to figure out what it was his sig stamp said<br/>
(Randy would LOVE this guy).  And of course, there were instructions that<br/>
told us to have fun and enjoy finding his first box, and if we got stumped,<br/>
to open the second envelope, which was enclosed in the larger envelope.<br/>
<br/>
Well you can imagine that he set the tone for the whole gathering.  Rather<br/>
than the mad rush of exchanges and dashing off to find other boxes and<br/>
stuffing ourselves to the gills, we all (even the LSS's) sat around my<br/>
campsite with a clue sheet in our hands trying to figure out whatever he<br/>
could be trying to tell us.  You would have to know the particular group of<br/>
folks that were there (Puddle Splasher and Viewfinder, Ruby Tuesday and<br/>
Stillwater, Catpawz (1 and 2), Lena, Cummins Clan, Delivery Girl, Fearless<br/>
Fox and Lightning and me), but there wasn't a soul that was about to ask for<br/>
the extra help!  We had all been working tirelessly to solve his signature<br/>
stamp and we sure weren't giving up on this.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we reluctantly decided it wasn't a box for us to get that day, and<br/>
everyone wandered off to find the other boxes that had been planted before<br/>
the gathering.  By just before dark, everyone had reluctantly found their<br/>
way home.<br/>
<br/>
Just as it was almost too dark to see, a figure approached the edge of our<br/>
campsite and asked why we weren't at the party.  It took me a minute to<br/>
understand what he meant, and then to realize who he was.  I jumped up and<br/>
introduced myself to him and invited him to come sit at our table with us -<br/>
it was HIM!  He said he knew no one found his box, but he also knew that no<br/>
one had used the extra help either.  He explained that we were all die-hards<br/>
and refused to use the help.  He asked me to open the envelope then, so I<br/>
did.  It said "If you have opened this envelope, you must be having<br/>
difficulty solving the clue.  Go to the cranberry-colored PT cruiser and ask<br/>
for help"  He had been waiting for us!  OH NO!<br/>
<br/>
Despite the fact that we ruined his surprise by our stubbornness (and by the<br/>
same token, I daresay he wouldn't assume we would give in again!), he sat<br/>
with us and helped us noodle through that clue while very patiently<br/>
answering questions about himself.  Fearless Fox felt the need to<br/>
periodically call Lightning and I off for a bit to give the man some peace,<br/>
but I think he enjoyed the attention!  Once he saw we were well on our way<br/>
to having it solved (it proved to be helpful that Fearless Fox had a<br/>
particular skill that very few people have), he left us.<br/>
<br/>
We did indeed solve it and claim it that night.  But to give a measure of<br/>
letterboxers: Ruby and Stillwater, Catpawz (1 and 2), and Puddle Splasher<br/>
and Viewfinder all returned the next morning bright and early having stayed<br/>
up until the wee hours to figure it out themselves and the others claimed it<br/>
not too long afterward.  Now THEY figured it out without the help of the<br/>
author AND they all drove back 40 or more miles to claim the box after<br/>
having been in the area the day before for the gathering!<br/>

I'm so glad you did! I love that he is still a bit of a mystery.  <br/>
Thanks so much for sharing such a fun story.<br/>

Indeed a great story....and yes, SC, *that* is what we need more of.<br/>
He sounds like a match for some of the furtive boxers of the northeast.<br/>

Thanks Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle for broadening the horizons for<br/>
newer players (and the rest of us, too).<br/>

You<br/>
&gt; know how you eventually learn boxer's real names as well as their <br/>
trail<br/>
&gt; names over time?  And you pretty much know at the very least where <br/>
they are<br/>
&gt; from?  Two years down the road, and no one still knows his real <br/>
name, or<br/>
&gt; even what town he actually resides in.  <br/>
<br/>
Wow, this gentleman sounds like the Father Christmas of letterboxing - <br/>
what a treasure!<br/>
