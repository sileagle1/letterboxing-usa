There have been many library boxes planted. They're usually planted <br/>
with the permission of the librarians and made out of a hollowed book <br/>
(Google "altered books" or "hollowed book" for instructions and <br/>
ideas). A neat touch is to locate it in the reference section with <br/>
the real Dewey Decimal or LOC number on the spine for a book on <br/>
letterboxing (and might even have a card in the card catalog). I <br/>
found one that was a hollowed out old book in a slipcase, which made <br/>
it easier for the whole thing to be kept together.<br/>
