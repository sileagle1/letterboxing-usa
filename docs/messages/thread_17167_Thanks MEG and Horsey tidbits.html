HORSE TIDBITS  :-p<br/>
<br/>
The Horse Latitudes were so named ( according to other horse geeks) <br/>
as this was a region where sailing ships would become becalmed.  <br/>
Horses being carried as "cargo" would be thrown overboard tolighten <br/>
the load.  So horses and pirates  hum there might be some tenuous <br/>
link.<br/>

Of course I have an answer for you.  HA!  Horses have always had <br/>
feathers.  Feathers are the long hairs that grow on the lower legs.  <br/>
They are usually most pronounced and quite shaggy in draft horses.  <br/>
Even hot bloods ( thoroughbreds etc) grow a tuft of long hair right <br/>
at the back of the "ankle".  They are usually shaved off as part of <br/>
routine grooming.<br/>
<br/>
Now back to boxing.<br/>
