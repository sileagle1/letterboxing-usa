<br/>
Tried e-mailing you at the address left in the hitchhiker, but it <br/>
bounced back to me. We found the Ped-X'ing HH in our <br/>
Meadowbrook Stables box when checking it last week (placed <br/>
there by Bare Ridge Gang?), and while the multicolored neon <br/>
notebook was there, the stamp was not.<br/>
<br/>
Can you (or anyone else on list) advise us re proper protocol on <br/>
lost stamps? If I can find you, I can mail the log back to you. Or <br/>
carve a replacement stamp and send it on its way? Or?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for suggestions.<br/>

February 2nd in the "Dam Keepers House" box near Shepherdstown, WV. <br/>
Someone going by the name "Clay Furnace" had left it there. I posted <br/>
to the group to see if anyone could identify it. Mohmers thought it <br/>
sounded like the stamp from a vandalized box of hers. I made it a <br/>
logbook and mailed it to her for a positive ID. Please e-mail me. <br/>
Maybe we can re-unite these two pieces.<br/>
