<br/>
Not sure if you are reading this site any longer but we came across <br/>
some old printed clues to your "Whale of a Time" letterbox in Bolton, <br/>
MA today and decided to check it out.  Prior to finding these clues <br/>
we've been wanting to get to this box but its link is broken on the <br/>
LBNA site; it's referencing the now defunct mediaone.net domain...   <br/>
<br/>
We found the box in great shape despite it having been over a year <br/>
since the last visitors were there.  Thanks for introducing us to <br/>
this great spot in Bolton; what a pretty hike!  <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure other folks would be interested in finding this box too.  Do <br/>
you have any interest in republishing the clues on the LBNA site?  <br/>
I'd be happy lend a hand in putting these on the site if you'd like <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
All:  If you know WaldenRun and can forward this message to her that <br/>
would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
Seekyr, Blaze, &amp; Mobius<br/>
