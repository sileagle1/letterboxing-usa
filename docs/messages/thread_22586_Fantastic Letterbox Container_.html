I have found what might be the best letterbox container!  (I'm so <br/>
excited, LOL!)<br/>
<br/>
I've been keeping my eyes out for months for a good, solid container... <br/>
something with a secure lid and all that good stuff; you know. Well, I <br/>
just picked up something called "Snapware" at my local Kroger. They <br/>
never carried this before. It's by a company called Komax and it's made <br/>
in Korea. I've put more details about it on my web page if you want to <br/>
take a look at it.<br/>
<br/>
You'll need to scroll about a quarter of the way down the page to where <br/>
it says "UPDATE: Sept. 2005..." and follow the link there to see the <br/>
cool container.<br/>
<br/>
http://cablespeed.com/~pedersenteevens/Letterboxing.html<br/>
<br/>
What's exciting is the lid locks on with these side flaps, and it <br/>
claims to be 100% airtight and 100% watertight! Pretty cool, eh?<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone else has used this, and if so... how well has <br/>
yours worked and how well has it held up?<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me on list, or privately... either way I'd love to <br/>
get your feedback! Thanks!!<br/>

Yes, I have seen this type of container on the trail.  It looks much like<br/>
Lock-n-lock and like the containers I am using for my Dora series.  I<br/>
can't say how durable they are yet.  If someone has 1 year or better<br/>
experience with this one, I'd love to know how the winter treated the<br/>
container.<br/>

&gt; Hello All --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have found what might be the best letterbox<br/>
&gt; container!  (I'm so <br/>
&gt; excited, LOL!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been keeping my eyes out for months for a good,<br/>
&gt; solid container... <br/>
&gt; something with a secure lid and all that good stuff;<br/>
&gt; you know. Well, I <br/>
&gt; just picked up something called "Snapware" at my<br/>
&gt; local Kroger. They <br/>
&gt; never carried this before. It's by a company called<br/>
&gt; Komax and it's made <br/>
&gt; in Korea. I've put more details about it on my web<br/>
&gt; page if you want to <br/>
&gt; take a look at it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll need to scroll about a quarter of the way<br/>
&gt; down the page to where <br/>
&gt; it says "UPDATE: Sept. 2005..." and follow the link<br/>
&gt; there to see the <br/>
&gt; cool container.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
http://cablespeed.com/~pedersenteevens/Letterboxing.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What's exciting is the lid locks on with these side<br/>
&gt; flaps, and it <br/>
&gt; claims to be 100% airtight and 100% watertight!<br/>
&gt; Pretty cool, eh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone else has used this, and if<br/>
&gt; so... how well has <br/>
&gt; yours worked and how well has it held up?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to email me on list, or privately...<br/>
&gt; either way I'd love to <br/>
&gt; get your feedback! Thanks!!<br/>

There is a very small size that sells for 99 cents, but I got a some a bit<br/>
bigger.  I have one that holds 2 travellers and 3 regular-sized stamp<br/>
pads.  I was always fumbling with my inkpads and baggies.<br/>

By the way, I purchased a really big rectangular one at Marsh Foods, about<br/>
$8 (why I bought it there is a mystery).  It holds a bag of potato chips<br/>
(after some have been eaten).  I don't throw out stale chips anymore: they<br/>
stay fresh for weeks.<br/>

&gt; Hello All --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have found what might be the best letterbox container!  (I'm so <br/>
&gt; excited, LOL!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been keeping my eyes out for months for a good, solid <br/>
container... <br/>
&gt; something with a secure lid and all that good stuff; you know. <br/>
Well, I <br/>
&gt; just picked up something called "Snapware" at my local Kroger. They <br/>
&gt; never carried this before. It's by a company called Komax and it's <br/>
made <br/>
&gt; in Korea. I've put more details about it on my web page if you want <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; take a look at it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You'll need to scroll about a quarter of the way down the page to <br/>
where <br/>
&gt; it says "UPDATE: Sept. 2005..." and follow the link there to see <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; cool container.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://cablespeed.com/~pedersenteevens/Letterboxing.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What's exciting is the lid locks on with these side flaps, and it <br/>
&gt; claims to be 100% airtight and 100% watertight! Pretty cool, eh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering if anyone else has used this, and if so... how well <br/>
has <br/>
&gt; yours worked and how well has it held up?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Feel free to email me on list, or privately... either way I'd love <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; get your feedback! Thanks!!<br/>
