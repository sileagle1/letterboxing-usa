else replies, I can go take a look<br/>

thought you meant  Relax and Read !! Sorry about that. In fact I think <br/>
the one you may be speaking of is by the Eagleville Dam ???? I am sure <br/>
you will hear about it from someone there, I do think it is missing <br/>
although I did get it quite sometime ago. B'fly<br/>

We were in Eagleville on 7/3/03. Found the other two boxes there, but not <br/>
Sit and Relax. When we got home. Russ checked the archives and found a post <br/>
from April of someone saying they had found that box trashed.<br/>

Thanks for the update Sadie and Russ- Glad to know my skills <br/>
haven't deteriorated--<br/>
And on a differnt thread,  I would like to request the LB Purple <br/>
Heart for Metoui's Chicken.Today she and I and RHCash 70 <br/>
braved the heat and decided to try out "I've Got Rhythm Series" <br/>
and  "My Favorite Musicals"-amoung others, as if!!!!!<br/>
Well she was so overheated despite hydration that she ended <br/>
up with heat exhaustion. It was A GOD SEND that a summer <br/>
storm blew in while we were on our way to "Louisa" and cooled <br/>
her down. We immediately abandoned our quest and headed <br/>
down the mountain, quick changed our clothes (good thing we <br/>
brought extra) and headed home-though home is about an hour <br/>
away. She is resting now, but not after tossing her cookies a few <br/>
times. <br/>
This has taught me a lesson, in this heat take extra <br/>
precautions-There is always going to be a cooler day to hike a <br/>
taller trail.<br/>
