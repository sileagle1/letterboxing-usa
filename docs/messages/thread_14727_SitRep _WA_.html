Team Rayvenhaus went off into the woods yesterday and we went 1 for 4.<br/>
<br/>
We attempted Pt. Defiance Galloping Gertie and could not find the starting point.  We attempted Camp Six, the directions brought us back down the same trail they had brought us up form the trestle.  We attempted the Humpty Dumpty box and got lost.  We attempted the Pt. Defiance Bear and found that one.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, not a good day thought the hiking was wonderful, the woods quiet and the PL number climbing.<br/>

Team Rayvenhaus went and hit the trails yesterday and here's the tally:<br/>
<br/>
We started at American Lake and found the SeaPlane LB.  Beautiful little park and there was even a few ladies in bikini's to enjoy while we were stamping in.  1 for 1.<br/>
<br/>
We then headed to Old Steilacoom in search of Chamber's Creek, which, we of course did not know existed before yesterday.  Following the trail, we found the Duck LB right were he was supposed to be, and then, in the middle of searching for the Salmon, we came across the resting place of Nursing the Fir LB.  Interesting place and interesting tin to say the least! (grin) On we trekked to the resting place for the Salmon and discovered her as well.  What a perfect spot to hide a box.  ON the way out we came across some goecacher's entering the part and it was funny to see them attempt to hide the GPS when they saw us round the trail, walking sticks and backpack in tow!  That puts us at 4 for 4.<br/>
