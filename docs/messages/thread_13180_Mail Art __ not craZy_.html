 nope, not crazy at all. I came to LB through rubber stamping - and <br/>
I stamp envelpoes and packages quite frequently just for the fun of <br/>
it and the delight of the recipients. <br/>
<br/>
 The term "mail art" means different things to different people. It <br/>
can be simply stamping an image on an envelope, OR making a work of <br/>
art out of it with stamps &amp; collage. OR, for other people it means <br/>
sending something unusual through the mail . . . . With a search on <br/>
google I did find one site that looks rather helpful &amp; even has some <br/>
carving info on it:<br/>
