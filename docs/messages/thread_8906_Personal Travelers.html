&gt; on another note, we want to create a traveling letterbox that goes <br/>
with our <br/>
&gt; son.  Does anyone know how to post clues for it.  To get the <br/>
letterbox you <br/>
&gt; just have to meet him.<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.<br/>

Christi, these "Personal Travelers In The Dartmoor Style" are <br/>
becoming more popular. I even know a dog who has one! I'd suggest <br/>
posting the info to the list just as you would for a hitch hiker, and <br/>
we'll sweep them onto the hitch hiker page. If the list of them <br/>
grows, or if people want, we could make these travelers a page of <br/>
their own...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Funny this has come up -- I have been reading a lot lately about <br/>
Dartmoor letterboxing and this idea of a personal traveler is <br/>
something I have found an interesting aspect of letterboxing and am <br/>
surprised that it is not more commonly used here in the states.  I <br/>
suspect perhaps because of logistics, that is in England, virtually <br/>
all letterboxing is done in and around Dartmoor NP, whereas in the <br/>
states...  well, I think it is safe to say anywhere but a NP (and <br/>
even some of those).  We are much more widespread and not as likely <br/>
to meet up with other letterboxes (unless of course you live in CT).<br/>
<br/>
I have been toying with the idea, but as the likelihood of me running <br/>
across any significant number of other letterboxers, who would then <br/>
be able to get a stamp of my personal traveler, is meager, I'm not <br/>
sure it would go anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea though.<br/>

Hi Jay (et. al.),<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt; we want to create a traveling letterbox<br/>
<br/>
There's a slight difference between "Personal Travelers In The Dartmoor <br/>
Style", and letterboxes along those lines (the distinction of which is <br/>
totally unimportant to anyone but box geeks like me :-) (for the geeks,<br/>
dumpster dive to Graham's message on 3/5/01, among others ...)) <br/>
<br/>
but ... (OTOH, whoa :-))<br/>
<br/>
&gt; we'll sweep them onto the hitch hiker page. <br/>
<br/>
I think they are really different enough from hitchhikers, yet sound <br/>
similar in name, that doing this will cause confusion for those who <br/>
care (whomever "those" may be ... presumably newbie geek wanabees)<br/>
<br/>
So, I would suggest a page for those who have declared themselves to be<br/>
carrying travelers and wish to be listed (presumed by posting to the list or<br/>
to the webmasters), and another page for those boxes of indeterminate <br/>
location that are neither mystery or hitchhikers. (Yes, this will confuse <br/>
those who are carrying letterboxes that are like travelers as to where to<br/>
be listed ... so one page for this prolly makes sense, and leave the<br/>
distinction in the mind of the finder :-))<br/>
<br/>
I guess this is more work, so take it is as letterboxing geek speak rather<br/>
than an actual request, but in an ideal world, its what I'd do ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

clues to personal travelers are either carried by the person who's traveler it <br/>
is (like Butterfly's traveler), or you have to check past e-mails.  <br/>
Sometimes, at a gathering, there will be personal traveler clues on the tables, and <br/>
then you have to figure out how to get the traveler by figuring out the clues.<br/>
