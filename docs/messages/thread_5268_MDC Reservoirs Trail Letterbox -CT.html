<br/>
It was a beautiful day this past Sunday for letterboxing.  A group of us walked the entire trail at the reservoir with no luck of finding the box.  Luckily we are a determined bunch and we happened to meet up with an orienteer who walked with us the second time to help locate the letterbox using a map.  (This also gave us the opportunity to explain to him about letterboxing).   Our determination proved to be successful.  Even with it turning in to 4.8 miles, it was a beautiful place, we enjoyed the hike, and we found the letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
We believe a few of the clues might need to be revised to help the next group find it a little easier.   We could have misread the clues however and started at the wrong starting point.  Could the owner just take a look and revise the clues, if necessary.  (A few people said the paths within the reservoir have changed recently which might be part of the reason for our confusion).  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
1)The clues begin as I84 northbound/southbound.  It should actually read eastbound/westbound.  <br/>
2) The clues say the box is near the 1-mile marker (painted on the road).  It is near the 2-mile marker.   <br/>
3) The clues say it is on a path to the left.  We found it on a path to the right.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
