middle of nowhere and the stars at night are just magnificent. Your <br/>
welcome to come to my house but I can't guarantee I'll be awake. I've <br/>
just been informed I won't be able to see this meteor shower again <br/>
until 100 years from now. So I suppose I WILL be awake, (sort of).<br/>
Now if it's cloudy, raining, snowing, etc. I'll be in Never Never <br/>
Land.<br/>

&gt; For those of you on the East Coast, be sure to check out the Leonid <br/>
&gt; meteor shower on Tuesday, November 19.  The shower will be most <br/>
&gt; visible from 5-6 AM that morning.  For best viewing conditions, <br/>
leave <br/>
&gt; the city lights behind and find an open area preferably at high <br/>
&gt; elevation.  I have never seen a meteor shower before and am very <br/>
&gt; excited!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone know of a good open area near Thurmont (or further out) <br/>
&gt; that is public property?  If not, I may have to drive out there and <br/>
&gt; scope something out.<br/>
