I had a fun morning in Salem letterboxing yesterday.  Here's a <br/>
status on the ones I sought after:<br/>
<br/>
Whoozy Goldfish-I'm pretty sure I found the right spot, but I <br/>
couldn't find the letterbox.  Did anyone else find it yet?<br/>
<br/>
45th Parallel/Mill Creek-I found this one....I received a wonderful <br/>
tour of the beautiful premices.  I'll have to save up some money to <br/>
return with my husband some day.  Incredible hidden treasure. =-)<br/>
Thanks Funhog and Matt the Rat.<br/>
<br/>
Minto Island-I enjoyed jogging in the mud to find this one.  Fun <br/>
fun!!  Great clues.  Thanks Jess.<br/>
<br/>
Bush's Park-Clever clues!! I was fooled and looking in the wrong <br/>
spot at first....I even ran into a bum hiding in a bush looking for <br/>
this one...kind of freaky.  Anyhow once I found it the letterbox was <br/>
floating in the water so I put it up higher in the stump.  I'll <br/>
email the owner as I felt awful not putting it the way I found it, <br/>
but it was drenched.  <br/>
<br/>
Great day in Salem...and then the rains came.  =-)<br/>
