My second thought is from one of my Mom's favorite quotes.<br/>
Leave the thinking to the horses, they have a bigger head.<br/>
My third thought was another quote my Mom's likes.<br/>
Dumbness is a gift from God, don't miss use it.<br/>
<br/>
But more important.<br/>
When and if you ever have kids remember this.<br/>
<br/>
When your 5 year old kid brings you a picture of his masterpiece and <br/>
he asks for your opinion. Please, even if it looks like crap.<br/>
DON'T RATE IT. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, Yes, Another thing. I will rate all of my stamps myself. Thank you<br/>
They are all crappy stamps. And I don't give a damn what anyone <br/>
thinks. I think that they are beautiful! <br/>

Gosh, I didn't realize this board was filled with a bunch of five <br/>
year olds.  I thought we were more grown up than that.<br/>
<br/>
There's a hitchhiker I started.  It's not a well-carved stamp by <br/>
most measures, but I know it was carved by an adorable nine <br/>
year old little girl.  It was her first stamp.  And I *LOVE* this <br/>
stamp.  And although from a "quality" perspective my carvings <br/>
are generally far better, for a girl her age, the stamp was <br/>
magnificant, and I told her that.  I didn't even have to lie, because <br/>
it was the truth.  Her stamp was magnificant.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; They are all crappy stamps. <br/>
<br/>
You've really got to work on that self-esteem issue, because I'm <br/>
sure you're perfectly capable of carving wonderful stamps.  If you <br/>
don't even TRY to carve a wonderful stamp, though, I'm not going <br/>
to hold much sympathy for you when somebody doesn't like it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; And I don't give a damn what anyone thinks. <br/>
<br/>
You seem to be quite upset about what I think, and I've never <br/>
even seen any of your carvings.  If you hide miniture pieces of art <br/>
in public, though, anyone who sees them is going to have an <br/>
opinion, and not all of them are going to be good.  Even the best <br/>
artists, writers, actors, and so on have their critics.  (I *HATE* <br/>
VanGogh's paintings.  They're ugly, boorish, and pieces of junk <br/>
in my opinion.  But he's certainly got a loyal following too.)<br/>
<br/>
If you hide stamps for the world to see, you'll have critics too.  If <br/>
you can't handle that, you could buy store-bought stamps, but <br/>
then people will criticize THAT because they want hand-carved <br/>
ones.  You could simply not hide boxes at all, but then people <br/>
that like your stamps will complain about not being able to find <br/>
them anymore.  You're never going to make everyone happy, so <br/>
do whatever you want and stop worrying about what everyone <br/>
else is thinking--because despite your protestations, you <br/>
obviously are pissed about my opinion.  I can see the venom <br/>
dripping from your teeth through my monitor.<br/>
<br/>
My mom gave me a wine rack when I moved out as a decoration.  <br/>
I don't drink wine and know little about it, so I called her up when <br/>
I was ready to stock it to ask if I should be using certain types of <br/>
wine or whatever.  Maybe they were supposed to alternate <br/>
red-white-red?  Maybe expensive wines were the way to go?  I <br/>
don't know anything about wine, so I asked for advice.  My mom <br/>
told me just to buy whatever bottles I thought looked the prettiest, <br/>
since I was only planning to use them for decor anyhow.  And no <br/>
matter what I bought, somebody would always think a different <br/>
type or selection would have been better.  Which made a lot of <br/>
sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
If you like your stamps and as long as you're enjoying yourself, <br/>
stop getting so upset about what people like me are thinking.  <br/>
Chill out.  Have fun.<br/>
