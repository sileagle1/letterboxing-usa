<br/>
Head deep into the park towards the land of pink birds. Those who <br/>
believe that he died for their sins will get the point. However, it <br/>
will be your blood that is spilled if you fail to take my warning. <br/>
The mosquitos are as big as birds and  so thick they turn day into <br/>
night. An exaggeration perhaps, but you might not think so if go <br/>
there. So you have three choices. You could go in the Florida winter <br/>
(which is Dec and Jan) and hope for the best. You could apply large <br/>
amounts of "Deep Woods Off" (or something else with at least 20% <br/>
DEET) which works relatively well against the winged vampires. Or you <br/>
could make a dash for it and have Red Cross meet you when you get <br/>
back out with an IV blood line setup ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Now if you find the trail and I haven't discouraged you from <br/>
entering, make your way through the first set of woods. You will then <br/>
open to a large marsh which you must cross. Go through the second set <br/>
of woods and then cross a very small marsh to the third set of woods. <br/>
Just inside the third set of woods you will see a tree to your right. <br/>
Check it out, and get out while you can ;-)<br/>

I did hide a box down in Southern FL too, but am not ready to publish <br/>
the clues yet.  will be forthcoming though.<br/>

Too bad you hadn't put up your South Florida box clue yet. I would <br/>
really have liked to look for it. I did get to visit the one in Ft <br/>
Lauderdale. Hopefully I'll catch yours in a month or so next time I <br/>
get down there. For anyone who plans to visit mine in the Everglades <br/>
prepare for a day trip (total there and back) from Miami. They are <br/>
really out in BFE (Backwoods Florida Everglades) ;-)<br/>
