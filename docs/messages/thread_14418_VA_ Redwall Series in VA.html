     About the time that someone in CA posted the start of their <br/>
Redwall Series of boxes, I had been working on starting one myself. <br/>
The first box (Redwall Abbey)has been hidden and posted in the NoVa <br/>
section. I have another one to go out,"Martin the Warrior".<br/>
     I seem to remember another VA boxer who was interested in <br/>
Redwall. I thought it would be fun to do an informal series around <br/>
the state. Whoever wants to make a Redwall box, go for it! Just label <br/>
it "Redwall Series: (Fill in the blank). We could have multiple boxes <br/>
of the same character if desired, just make the name of the box <br/>
different.<br/>
     If you have not read this great series of books, please do! <br/>
Adults love them as much as children. <br/>
