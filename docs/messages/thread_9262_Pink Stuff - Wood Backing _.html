I use either Plumber's Goop or a silicon adhesive like the household <br/>
product made by GE (you can get them at Wal-Mart or Home Depot). These are <br/>
water- and temperature-resistant, and will bond different textured surfaces <br/>
quite well. These adhesives are flexible, so they 'give' a bit when <br/>
stressed instead of failing. It's important that you coat the wood backing <br/>
evenly with the glue and then press it firmly in place so that the front of <br/>
the stamp is perfectly flat -- if the stamp warps because the glue is <br/>
uneven, you won't get a good image from the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Also, Wal-Mart sells 1/8" (or so) thick pieces of pine in its craft section <br/>
that work pretty well for a backing. They come in packages, 6 6" x 3" (or <br/>
so) sheets to a pack, for 99 cents. I like them because they're thin, which <br/>
makes it easier to fit in a letterbox with the journal and other stuff. The <br/>
wood can be cut easily (you can also get a miter box and saw at Wal-Mart <br/>
very inexpensively). I'm trying some hardwoods now, like ash and maple in <br/>
3/8" and 1/4" thicknesses, and they're working well, but I'm not sure they <br/>
provide an end result that's any better than the Wal-Mart stuff.<br/>
<br/>
You must sand the edges and face of the wood to remove rough edges and <br/>
create a good surface for the stamp image. After sanding, I stamp the image <br/>
on the wood (if I mess up, I just sand it down and start again <g>), let it <br/>
dry, then apply 2 coats of spray polyurethane or lacquer, let that dry, <br/>
sand it lightly, and then spray a final clear coat. Once that coat is dry, <br/>
I glue on the stamp and let it cure for at least 24-48 hours before sealing <br/>
it in the letterbox.<br/>

i used rubber cement for my sig stamp. the key is to<br/>

rubber stamp stores may or may not have nicely shaped<br/>

I used wood glue once, and it seemed to work pretty well.  But <br/>
then I decided the backing wasn't worth the hassle, so I stopped <br/>
making them completely.  (I'm lazy at heart.  Really!  *smile*)<br/>

Team GD,<br/>
<br/>
As another poster has written, Superglue/Crazyglue  (cyanoacrylate), <br/>
works well.  I agree.  I have made over 50 stamps using the pink <br/>
stuff, the white stuff, and several other stuffs.  I have used a <br/>
plank of 1/8 inch balsa for most of the stamps.  It seems to be <br/>
pretty stable unless the stamp gets soaked in water.  Then, like <br/>
other woods, it warps.  If if warps the right direction, then you <br/>
just have a roll on stamp :)  I cut it with the same exacto knife I <br/>
use to cut the piece of rubber out of the larger piece.  The glue <br/>
sticks in about 10 seconds.  So from rubber stamp and back, it takes <br/>
about 10 seconds to stamp the stamp on the wood and then another 30 <br/>
seconds to attach it to the wood.  <br/>

<br/>
A couple of people have mentioned that they use rubber cement <br/>
for backings, and I'd like to say that I've found a couple that look <br/>
like they were glued with rubber cement and they're falling off.<br/>
<br/>
I played around with rubber cement a little bit, but I just found it <br/>
too easy to peal off.  Granted, people aren't supposed to TRY to <br/>
peal it off, but when I wanted to glue on a back, I wanted to make <br/>
sure it would stick for a long, long time with minimal upkeep, and <br/>
it's my experience that rubber cement is not the best glue for the <br/>
job.<br/>
<br/>
The outdoor "weatherproof" wood glue I used seemed to work <br/>
great and was still hanging tight as a slug in a film canister six <br/>
months later.  (I used a wood backing for it--cherry.)<br/>
<br/>
How tight is a slug in a film canister?  I bet it'll still be in there six <br/>
months later!  Not that I've tried it, of course.  =)<br/>

The trick with rubber cement is to follow the directions for a <br/>
permanent bond.  When using rubber cement, if you just coat both <br/>
surfaces and stick them together immediately, they are SUPPOSED to be <br/>
able to peal apart, and they will even though it seems like they're <br/>
sticking when you adhere them to one another.  For a permanent bond <br/>
you need to use a thin coat and let it get tacky (at least 30 <br/>
minutes) before sticking them together.  I've used this method for <br/>
years for many projects that have been exposed to heat, cold, <br/>
moisture, etc. and it is very reliable.<br/>
