in "south - western - central ??" Virginia! <br/>
While I was there, I also found a "time capsule" from a family that <br/>
camps in the nearby campground. It was begun in 1999! very <br/>
interesting. <br/>
I also foung the B-25 letterbox in the same park. Unfortunately the <br/>
fog had come in and there were no views at the top.<br/>
