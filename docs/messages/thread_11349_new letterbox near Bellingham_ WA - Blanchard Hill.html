                    <div class="plaintext-content">I submitted this a few months ago, but it has not been posted, yet.  I am <br/>
not sure if it fell through the cracks.  It was planted by Michaela (7) and <br/>
Isaac (5).  If anyone visits it, please let me know how it looks.  We <br/>
haven't been back to check on it yet.<br/>
<br/>
Take the I-5 to the Alger exit (240) west.  Turn left at Barrell Springs Rd. <br/>
  Pass Shaw Rd and turn right on B-1000 Rd to Blanchard Hill.  Pass the <br/>
first parking lot and keep driving up the hill.  Park at the second parking <br/>
lot.  Walk back down to Lily and Lizard Lake trail.  Follow the trail.  <br/>
Cross the bridge and keep following the trail.  Turn right at the Y in the <br/>
trail.  Follow up the hill.  Cross a small creek bed.  Just on the left, up <br/>
the hill is a huge stump.  Behind the stump to the right, under a root is <br/>
the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
We look forward to checking on it and finding lots of new stamps in it!!     <br/>
