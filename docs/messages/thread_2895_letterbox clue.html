<div>Rte 195 to Bassettes Bridge Road at Mansfield 
Center. Go past the parking lot and unload your boat at the boat launch. Put in 
near a brown pole with washed out writing "no swimming". Go around the far side 
of the closest island. Now, facing the opposite shore, go 20' north until there 
is a section of calm water where the Mt. Hope river inlet. this is a cool place 
to explore- but sometimes the water is shallow and you can get stuck on rocks. 
Now go 210' to a very flat island that may look like part of the shore if you 
dont look closely. This is further than it looks, but not too bad. Go to the 
left hand side of the island . There is now a "cove" in shallow water, but if 
the water is high it can look like the island is split in 2. Now there is a 
TREE- not a bush- in one area wherethe tree splits in 2, find your box. Stamp in 
and replace by wedging the box in TIGHTLY or it may float away. Maybe you could 
tie it in with vines if the string is gone. paddle to the end of the island and 
you can see the beach. paddle back, and you are done. Water can be shallow in 
some places. Look out for stumps. ALSO: if the water is high, you may not be 
able to get out of your boat, as the island is submerged. Dont stand in 
your boat to reach the box.</div></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>Hi, Our names are Carol and Jessi Cleveland, but we're signing as the Cleveland girls.</p>
<p>The box we placed is called the Schroeder Box and was placed on Feb, 19, 2003.</p>
<p>It is in Josephine county, city of Grants Pass, state of Oregon.</p>
<p>Easy to find</p>
<p>This is our first box and we have a feeling our hiding place may need some improvement. We'll keep on trying.   Directions to this box: Take Redwood Ave. from GP and turn right on Willow lane. Willow lane turns into Schroeder lane after the stop sign. Keep on Schroeder, then make a right turn into the "ball field". If you make it to the campground or the river you've gone too far. It is marked as "ball field". Pass the tennis court and head to the second ball field. From the home plate a batter would have to hit the ball approx. 125 paces over right field. As the ball rolls out there, it will see a path between the field and the campground. If the ball were to fall to the left side of that path and up to the base of the second tree to the left it might run into a surprise.  Happy hunting.</p><p><br/></p><hr size="1"/>Do you Yahoo!?<br/>
