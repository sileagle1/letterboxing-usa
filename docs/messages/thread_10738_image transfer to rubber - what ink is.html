bits of plastic that are literally melted onto the paper.  That would <br/>
explain the hot iron transfer.  I wonder what Kinkos is using now.  <br/>
<br/>
Inkjet printers really are ink and quite different.<br/>

&gt; When I first started carving last year, I found that the easiest <br/>
method was<br/>
&gt; to make a copy at Kinko's, place the image face down on the rubber <br/>
and heat<br/>
&gt; it for a few seconds with an iron. It created a beautifully detailed<br/>
&gt; transfer that could be handled without smears.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, lately that method has resulted in nothing being <br/>
transfered to the<br/>
&gt; rubber. I tried the Acetone method with the same results. I even <br/>
tried a<br/>
&gt; T-shirt transfer, but couldn't get it hot enough without melting <br/>
the rubber.<br/>
&gt; At my wits end and with some very intricate stamp images just <br/>
begging to be<br/>
&gt; carved, I talk to the people at Kinkos.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Apparently, they have changed their ink. It's now oil based and <br/>
sealed to<br/>
&gt; the paper. This prevents the ink from sticking to other sheets of <br/>
paper or<br/>
&gt; plastic covers (like it used to when put in a binder). "Archive <br/>
safe" I<br/>
&gt; think they call it now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Solution: I went to the library and used their ancient copier and <br/>
VOILA! A<br/>
&gt; perfect image transfer, just like I used to get. So, if you have <br/>
tried the<br/>
&gt; 'heat transfer' method and it didn't work, you may need to use an <br/>
older<br/>
&gt; copier. By the way, I'm using PZ Cut and I'm still using the <br/>
original batch,<br/>
&gt; so I knew that wasn't what had changed :-) New and more intricate <br/>
stamps are<br/>
&gt; on the way to boxes in Cincinnati!<br/>
