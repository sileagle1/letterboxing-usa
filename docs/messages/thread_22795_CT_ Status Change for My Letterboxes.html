have decided to remove my clues from the LBNA list. I am concerned <br/>
that with clues posted easily in the article, that vandalism may occur <br/>
and possibly spill over into researching clues to do so with other <br/>
boxes. I realize that this may not be perceived as the best thing to <br/>
do or as a "Knee jerk" reaction. So be it. My feeling is as is and I <br/>
will not put my boxes or local wilderness areas at risk. I hope I am <br/>
wrong, I am from Winsted and hope better of it.<br/>
   The clues to those boxes will be by WOM. I can also be contacted on <br/>
the LBMA group.<br/>
   Again, I hope I am wrong about what this article will do. I'm sorry <br/>
for any inconvenience. The Four Directions clues will remain in place <br/>
temporarily, but will likely be effected as well.<br/>

I know you are not part of this group and don't see these posts, but maybe somene will rely this thought.  I don't see anything in the article that you need be afraid of.  I am sorry that you need to go undergound  Many letterboxing friends will suffer from your decision.  Please consider your position and reconsider. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
