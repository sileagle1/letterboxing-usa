That was wrong of me Please forgive me.<br/>Except for AD who sent me a threatening email. Dude my offer still<br/>stands anytime you want to come out from behind your computer. I dont<br/>sit well for being threatened anytime. In pain or nor, stressed or<br/>not. Again to the rest of you I am sincerely sorry. Take care !!<br/><br/>PS No Don I was never on the list before.
