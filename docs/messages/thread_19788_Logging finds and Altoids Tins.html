As for the use of Curiously Strong tins, I have been using them successfully for a <br/>
couple of years, both indoors and out. There is a photo of one of the hinged types in <br/>
the Files section of this page under "Funhog." Be sure to clean them with bleach <br/>
before use to rid them of any food smell that might attract animals. Then, use small <br/>
ziplocks that will fit inside the box, double bagging the contents to keep everything <br/>
dry. Exterior plastic bags seem to deteriorate very rapidly and hold moisture against <br/>
the box, so I rarely use them anymore. Funhog<br/>
