Well, I meant to post this before midnight, so really yesterday was the official day I believe.....<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, happy one-year anniversary of the article in the Weekend section of the Washington Post that I think was at least fairly responsible for the growth of this awesome hobby in the DC area.  It is how we learned about it, and while I guess it would be overstating it a bit to say it has "changed our lives," it certainly has changed how we as a family spend our lesiure time, and I couldn't be happier about that.  Even with dozens of scratches on my legs and a bee sting on my arm from a particularly hairy letterboxing day, I have to say that I am proud of my wounds.  As my son's pediatrician once said, you don't get bruises, scrapes and cuts sitting at home in front of the TV!<br/>

Many thanks to Reporter at Large for sharing her article with all of us, and thanks to all the wonderful fellow boxers we've met and conversed with online for adding yet another great benefit to this hobby - meeting cool people like yourselves.  :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is how we learned of letterboxing as well. However, it took me <br/>
about 8 months to get the rest of the family interested. Then I had <br/>
to highjack them. I gathered stamps, ink and log books for everyone <br/>
and when we stopped at a park I pulled out clues and we were off. <br/>
