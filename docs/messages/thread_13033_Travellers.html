How exactly does one know a Boxer is carrying a Traveler? If they sometimes require you to solve a riddle or complete a task, how do you know to do it?  Do you ask every boxer you meet "Do you have a Traveler?"<br/>
<br/>
Are they listed somewhere?<br/>

Dear Steve, et al,<br/>
<br/>
I had not announced it. There is a small conflict within our hearts. <br/>
You see, Hunt for the Jersey Devil is happening the same weekend as <br/>
the Fright one you are holding. True, yours is a day earlier, but <br/>
they did ask first. You see our dilemma, don't you?<br/>
<br/>
We called up the shade of the wisest guy we knew. No, not Danny <br/>
Devito, he is still alive. Instead, we made that chalk outline of an <br/>
interlocking double triangle and invoked Solomon. Sol, as he now <br/>
likes to be called, advised us to split the event stamps up. <br/>
<br/>
We will be sending the Pacific NW Event and legerdemaine's KMartha <br/>
event stamps up to Team Rayvenhaus. We will be sending Opraha, A <br/>
Little Birdie Told Me, and the newest event box - Cheese Racing <br/>
Ballot Box - out to New Jersey. If you and the Jersey folk wish to <br/>
argue it out (off the board, please) and swap some stamps around, do <br/>
so but let us know before Tuesday, the next day mail can go out. <br/>
JugglerMouse will mail the boxes then.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this manages to cheese-off the fewest folks possible. <br/>
<br/>
As Ricky Nelson so succinctly put it, "You can't cheese everyone, so <br/>
you gotta cheese yourself!"<br/>

someone else asked first, then they get the stamps. Not that this is/was a<br/>
race, but the first one to ask is the one that should get the stamps.  In my<br/>
NOT so humble opinion.  Since the events are planned for the same weekend,<br/>
there's no way to 'share' them all.  Please understand something here. I'm<br/>
not one to gripe about things beyond my control. Please, by all means, keep<br/>
the stamps together, as that was what you first said, if I remember<br/>
correctly, that the first one to email you off list was going to get the<br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
However, if you really want to split them up and send a few our way, we'd be<br/>
most happy to receive and care for them till the Fest is over and return<br/>
them to you along with images from the Events stamps for Fright Fest as<br/>
well.<br/>

Greetings Mmmmmm.... (What on earth do I call you?) RayvenDad!!!!<br/>
<br/>
You are absolutely correct and I apologize for my unbecoming display of<br/>
jealousy and animosity over the entire thing.  I agree with your prior post<br/>
completely that the said stamps should not be broken up and thereby all of<br/>
them should be sent to Jersey who ask first.<br/>
<br/>
I can only offer that I am medicated and emotional and that the event stamps<br/>
from the SLO gathering (since that is my original letterboxing 'stamping'<br/>
ground) had some sentimental meaning to me.<br/>
<br/>
Never the less I do most humbly apologize to the group, the SLO "Googled"<br/>
Team, and other people who shall remain nameless that would disapprove of my<br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
How about to make up for it I offer to carve something special for Fright<br/>
Fest?? Any suggestions??<br/>
