cool &amp; clear day, some food cooked over an open flame, and most important of <br/>
all---a day of LETTERBOXING!!!!  We have to make up for the rain that put a <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kids Day 2002 was also our first dabbling in letterboxing. And Rocky <br/>
Neck is a special place for us as we held our wedding reception there <br/>
in October last year as well! <br/>
<br/>
What I was kind of thinking was something like a "Connecticut <br/>
Icebreaker" in say... January or February?  I'm just not sure where <br/>
to have such an event as you will have to have some indoors facility <br/>
for folks to get warmed up in -- Heidi and I don't really look <br/>
forward to having to use our EMT skills : )  We think Nov 2nd is a <br/>
bit quick to plan an event and it seems that Ginger Meets Molly was <br/>
the big event for the fall. Maybe it is even best to wait until <br/>
spring thaw? I know we are very busy for the next 2-3 weeks with work <br/>
and life in general (and I know many other boxers who are busy <br/>
too!).  <br/>
<br/>
Also a consideration is that once November swings in there will be a <br/>
lot of folks getting busy with the holidays etc. If we can come to a <br/>
consensus on the "theme" and a general time frame it will give folks <br/>
a lot of cold days and nights to get carving by the fireside! <br/>
