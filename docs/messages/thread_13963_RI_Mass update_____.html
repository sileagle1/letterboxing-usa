    A Monk's Tale (RI..6/27/03)....all in place..great stamps!!! <br/>
<br/>
   Day before..Fairies at Borderland (MASS)...Found Serentiy II and <br/>
Love...(not a stone bench<br/>
but I got an extra kiss!!!)....could not find <br/>
Hope....bugs/heat/humidity/..."solitary tree"....moved on.....and <br/>
the last "Peace"...lot's of trees seemed dead until you looked up <br/>
and saw green branches. Nice hike though!!<br/>
<br/>
  Today...our first mystery box...."I'm watching..."....etc...as <br/>
soon as I read this I had an inkling....of things.  Found the box. <br/>
Then onto the long hike of Things to do With Stone.  Thought one box <br/>
was missing when last we looked but they are all there.  Nice long <br/>
hike.  Very enjoyable. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

get in on the action!!!  He has been on a few Geocaches and wants to <br/>
experience Letterboxing...stay <br/>
