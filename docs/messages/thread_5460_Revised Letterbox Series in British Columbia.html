Just a couple words of advice, watch out for the nettles, as they are everywhere and we also suggest that a pair of gloves and a flashlight might be useful. The series are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
Derby Reach Series:<br/>
<br/>
1. Edge Farm Trail letterbox <br/>
<br/>
Degree of Difficulty: Easy <br/>
<br/>
Cross the border into British Columbia at any one of the Lower Mainland border points with Washington State. You now want to seek out the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) park known as "Derby Reach" <br/>
For those of you who would like it to be a little easier, we have attached the website map of the <br/>
park. <br/>
