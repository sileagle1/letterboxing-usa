Yes, there was a message recently from, I think, legerdemaine (who placed it) <br/>
that the log had filled up and she had removed it temporarily but planned to <br/>
put it back with a new log. So I guess don't bother to look for it until we hear it's <br/>
back.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now this is really strange.  The Yachtsman and I visited The <br/>
Smithsonian Letterbox on Monday, Dec 30th at about 10AM, and it was <br/>
certainly alive and well then.  We waited until 10 because we had <br/>
some misinformation that the museum didn't open until then, but <br/>
it was actually open at 9 am.  <br/>
<br/>
There were two folded logs in the canister.  One was totally full. <br/>
We were able to squeeze onto the last couple of spaces on the back <br/>
of the second one.  Based on the date of your posting, we may<br/>
actually have had it out to stamp in when you tried to find it!  An <br/>
amazing number of letterboxers had already stamped in before us in one <br/>
short month.  <br/>
