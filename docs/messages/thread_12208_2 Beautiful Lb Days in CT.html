 My DD, Corrina and I, The Engraver (aka, Donna Mae) went out late on Sunday <br/>
(we both had to work) but we did manage to Launch "The Easter Bunny, HH" hop <br/>
hop hop away little bunny. Today, Monday we spent the entire day on some <br/>
Beautiful Trails in and around Windsor. Thank you everyone who has taken the <br/>
time to point these trails out to us. We would have never found them on our <br/>
own.  Cute Cluckers, Cream of the Crop is SOAKED we couldn't even open the <br/>
pages to sign in. The South Windsor Wildlife Sanctuary (3), picked up a New <br/>
HH "Snow Flake," Windsor River Trail, "Keep on Rollin' stamp is BROKEN. <br/>
"Bully" is bulling the entire pond. Next we headed to NW Park with the <br/>
"Little Creatures."  "My Favorite Stinky Thing"  and "Perfect Sunday <br/>
Afternoon"  all are in fine shape.<br/>
Thank you again everyone!<br/>
The Engraver<br/>
