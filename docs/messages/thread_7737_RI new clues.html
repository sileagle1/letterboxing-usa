<p align="CENTER"></p><b><i>GREAT SWAMP MONUMENT LETTERBOX<br/>
WEST KINGSTON, RHODE ISLAND</i></b><br/>
<p align="LEFT"><br/>
</p><b>PLACED:</b> January 12, 2002<br/>
            By Kokopelli<br/>
<br/>
<b>RATING: </b> Easy 2 mile round trip on old abandoned dirt road<br/>
<br/>
<b>DRIVING DIRECTIONS:</b> Take Rt. 2 South into West Kingston.  About 1 mile past the junction of Rt. 138, look for the old white historical marker Great Swamp Monument on the left, just past Liberty Lane.  At the sign, take a left onto Great Swamp Monument Drive (a bumpy dirty road) and park at the gate.  <br/>
<br/>
<b>CLUES:</b>  From the parking area follow the old road easterly to the old circular parking area.  From there, the grassy road leads east again out to the monument.    The monument is placed at the sight of the Great Swamp Massacre of Sunday, December 19, 1675.  During King Philips War the Narragansetts took refuge on this piece of high ground in the swamp.  They would have been well protected from their enemies but a cold spell froze the waters of the swamp.  The Colonist led by Benjamin Church, marched across the ice and charged the encampment setting it on fire and killing almost 1,000 Narragansetts, many of them women and children.  The monument is a huge granite monolith ringed by 4 granite stones representing the colonial regiment.<br/>
    Stand at the North side of the monolith.  Walk 42 paces at 10 to reach a small deer trail on your right.  There is a white pine at 45 of great girth about 15 feet from where you stand.  Bushwhack in to unearth a slice of history on the north side of the tree under a stone.<br/>

<div>I tried for this box about a month ago, and figured 
I would just walk in from the gate.  Unfortunately, there is a private 
house located just before the gate and their large and very territorial dog was 
loose and wouldn't allow me and my wimpy mutt out of the car.  Since I 
won't pepperspray a dog unless it's absolutely necessary (IMO, in a case like 
this the dog is just doing his job...it's the owners who should take a shot of 
spray for being irresponsible if they let him loose on purpose), I turned and 
drove out with Fido snarling at the windows the whole way out.  It should 
be noted, however, that he was definitely snarling at my dog, not 
me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't want to turn anyone off from trying this 
box.  I will certainly be going back myself.  If I run into Fido 
again, I'll give it still another shot but leave my dog at home.  Afterall, 
Fido may have gotten loose accidentally, and I'd be tossing bricks from my own 
glass house if I got bent out of shape over it.  My border collie mix is 
becoming infamous in my neighborhood for zipping past people at the door 
and trying to herd the local cats (with me in the background yelling "watch the 
do......, aw, crap!).  The cats don't enjoy it much, but luckily, my neighbors are very 
understanding.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just a heads up.</div>
