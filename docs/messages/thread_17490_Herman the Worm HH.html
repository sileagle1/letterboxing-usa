                    <div class="plaintext-content"> WOW! Thanks for the update on Herman's whereabouts. I was getting <br/>
pretty worried about him since I hadn't heard anything since he was <br/>
placed way back in June of 2003. Looks like he has been a man of the <br/>
world in all of his travels. His logbook must be getting pretty full <br/>
by now. If it needs replacing please let me know and I can whip one <br/>
up and mail it to you since his home is in Washington. Email me at <br/>
tinarie at msn dot com. Thanks again!<br/>
