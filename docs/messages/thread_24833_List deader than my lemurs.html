wars, multiple personalities, and endless debates about PFX counts?<br/>
<br/>
On some level I guess it's a good thing.  People are just enjoying <br/>
boxing and not getting all wrapped up in turf wars.  However those <br/>
turf wars certainly infused this site with some spirit.  <br/>
<br/>
So in the spirit of the old ways here's a thread to get you going:<br/>
<br/>
KILL THIS SITE!  Very few people seem to post, the information posted <br/>
here could easily transfer to any of the myriad other sites, and <br/>
clearly Randy wants a break from monitoring this dreck.<br/>

"So, I have to turn LEFT at the spotted rock.  Thanks for spoon feeding me.  I love living in this box, I just wish I could get out sometimes.  Maybe I'll try again next week."<br/>
<br/>
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THE OLD SCHOOL DAYS OF THIS HOBBY?  <br/>
<br/>
I'M TALKING BEFORE THE BOY AND GIRL SCOUT AROUND THE CAMPFIRE NONSENSE.  <br/>
<br/>
ANYONE REMEMBER WHEN THINGS WERE SECRETIVE?  <br/>
<br/>
IT SUCKS NOW AND THAT'S WHY NO ONE HEARS FROM THE PEOPLE WHO USED TO MAKE IT FUN.  <br/>
<br/>
BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT WHO THEY OFFENDED.  <br/>
<br/>
THEY DON'T CARE AND REALLY DON'T WANT TO HEAR THE CRYING AND/OR DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF BEING BANNED BY BIG BROTHER...OR WHATEVER.<br/>
<br/>
ONCE PEOPLE STOP WHINING AND CRYING WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT LIKE IT WAS.<br/>
<br/>
ANYTHING SHORT OF THAT....FORGET IT...IT'LL CONTINUE TO SUCK.<br/>
<br/>
I know someone needs a hanky right now so I'll stop.<br/>
