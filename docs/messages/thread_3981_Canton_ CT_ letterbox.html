So many of you have asked how you can help. One simple action you can take<br/>
today is to visit The Hunger Site (http://www.thehungersite.com) and click<br/>

&lt;&lt; Found this one [Farmington River Rail Trail Letterbox in Canton, CT]<br/>
today. Surprisingly, I was the first one in it. I thought our friend from<br/>
Axtown would have been right there. It was in good shape.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ironic, isn't it? I haven't yet looked for the very letterbox that's closest<br/>
to my Axtown abode. In fact, I decided to postpone my search for it until<br/>
later this winter, when the weather precludes traveling greater distances or<br/>
digging too deeply in snow for boxes. However, I was surprised to read that<br/>
you were the first one to stamp in. Shortly after the box was planted, my<br/>
good friend Sugarmaker found it, and he was followed in short order by ESAK.<br/>
Hmmm, quite the mystery!<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I myself have been venturing far afield during December,<br/>
pursuing various letterboxes while the winter weather - though cold and<br/>
crisp<br/>
- remains otherwise hospitable for the hunt. The Collinsville Crew spent a<br/>
Sunday afternoon early in the month following in the footsteps of Harry, Ron<br/>
and Hemione in the Drewclan's wonderful Harry Potter series of letterboxes.<br/>
Except for Griffindor Tower (which we believe is missing or perhaps has been<br/>
made invisible), all of the four remaining boxes are intact. The Drewclan's<br/>
hand-carved stamps really capture the spirit of the story!<br/>
<br/>
After having been put in the employ of Max Q. (of Dan and Melissa fame), I<br/>
next pursued an escaped prisoner from nearby Old New-Gate prison a week or<br/>
so<br/>
later. With a little bit of assistance from members of the Bonnie and Clyde<br/>
gang - whom I met along the trails - I managed to find all four of the boxes<br/>
in this series, although the prisoner himself appears to have evaded my<br/>
capture and fled north into Massachusetts. This is another excellent hike,<br/>
and the hand-carved stamps are especially eye-catching.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I made my way this past Sunday afternoon to Glastonbury, where I<br/>
found the Varrell family's two Santa's Playground letterboxes at J. B.<br/>
Williams Park and their Picnic Boulder letterbox along the Shenipsit Trail.<br/>
Much to my surprise (not!), at this last box I had been preceded first by<br/>
Wanda and Pete and then by Dan and Melissa. Maybe they really *are*<br/>
different<br/>
couples...or maybe not! Alas, I was much less successful at the South<br/>
Glastonbury ferry landing, where - despite the seemingly simple clues - the<br/>
Ferry Flit box eluded me completely (aren't those always the hardest to<br/>
find?).<br/>
<br/>
Pat Koss continued:<br/>
&lt;<then farmington="" give="" greenway<br="" i="" north="" simsbury="" the="" to="" valley="" went="">
another try. I found the box, but it was empty except for a pencil. My<br/>
husband suggested that putting it along the path rather than at the end<br/>
where<br/>
it looks like beer drinking youths congregate would be better. Sorry to have<br/>
to be the bearer of bad news again. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ouch! That's the second time in three months a letterbox has disappeared<br/>
from<br/>
this location...definitely a problematic place. When I went looking in late<br/>
October, that box was there, having just been replaced by Bill Haalck after<br/>
the first box went missing. The second hiding place was more covert than the<br/>
first, but apparently beer-drinking youths will not be denied.<br/>
<br/>
Happy holidays to all!<br/>

Alan from Axtown<br/>
