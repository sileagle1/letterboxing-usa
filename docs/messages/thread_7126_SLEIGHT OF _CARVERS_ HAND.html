run into an image you would love to stamp, frame and hang on your <br/>
wall. as long as it doesnt turn into financial gain. then it gets <br/>
into this whole copyright mess, and this is a fun non-profit thing, <br/>
and yada yada yada...<br/>
<br/>
i am an artist. i made an image i was terribly happy with and made a <br/>
bunch of prints before i planted it. to sell. and then i thought <br/>
about it. if they arent willing to do the legwork... and it's not <br/>
fair to the people who are... so i made more images specifically to <br/>
sell. AND I DIDNT SEE ANYBODY AT MY ART SHOW! so i have all these <br/>
images matted signed i really dont want to throw away... i guess i <br/>
shall cart around a few hoping for exchanges. to anyone who has <br/>
already seen the ov box. uuuurg. by the way, i am a packrat and it <br/>
pains me to throw away anything. or email me or something. i just <br/>
wanna know that you hit the box first. <br/>
have fun<br/>
