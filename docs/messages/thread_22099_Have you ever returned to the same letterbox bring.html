and/or city) and the date I found the box (a small<br/>
spreadsheet). This way I can check to make sure I am<br/>
not going after the same boxes unless of course it was<br/>
on purpose. I would find that as annoying as getting a<br/>
book from the library that I read before and forgot<br/>
until I finish the first chapter (I hate that!).<br/>
