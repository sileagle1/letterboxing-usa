Camping would be great. Greenbrier State Park in Hagerstown <br/>
(actually between Hagerstown and Frederick) has camping and <br/>
several boxes. We took the family at the end of June and had a <br/>
great time. May might be too cold?<br/>
<br/>
Would anyone be interested in this? A DC/MD/VA gather in MD?<br/>

gather)<br/>

&gt; I want to thank Scarab and everyone else that made this gather <br/>
a reality! It was my first event and I didn't expect to have soooo <br/>
much fun. I'm glad I hung out all day and joined in for the mystery <br/>
dinner afterwards. I'm glad I found a hobby with so many nice <br/>
people attached to it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; See ya all at the next one! Camping in May?<br/>

&gt; Who would have expected 30 people would show up in the <br/>
dead of winter <br/>
&gt; to NOT go leterboxing?  Who would have dreamed 6 of them <br/>
would bring <br/>
&gt; fabulous event stamps? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was very happy so many Marylanders came despite the long <br/>
trip.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There were lots of new faces and several kids.  Pictures soon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bethany came from Washington state. (Where they just say <br/>
Washington, <br/>
&gt; always meaning the state, not D.C.  Hope I got her name right.) <br/>
She <br/>
&gt; brought with her a half dozen traveling event stamps including <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; infamous K-MARTha.  I also saw the wonderful LbNA U.S. map <br/>
stamp.  <br/>
&gt; (more on these later)  Thanks so much for bringing them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With the freezing cold, and only one on-site letterbox, people <br/>
stayed <br/>
&gt; and exchanged and socialized for a long time.  This was great.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After hoping that a couple people would show up for the <br/>
mystery <br/>
&gt; dinner that evening, almost 20 arrived.  Did anyone count?  <br/>
There was <br/>
&gt; even a surprise mystery guest whose long name begins with <br/>
L. Then <br/>
&gt; someone realized there was no mystery dinner stamp and 2 <br/>
were quickly <br/>
&gt; carved at the table.  Too cool.  Of course, I still can't say where <br/>
&gt; the mystery dinner was. :-)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many, many thanks to Eileen of Celtic Pride for arriving early <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; helping set up, and for the mystery location.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many thanks for all the great event stamps.  That was a real <br/>
surprise <br/>
&gt; for me and a delight to all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for all for coming and sharing.<br/>

&gt; Who was really, really nervous at 9:55am.<br/>
