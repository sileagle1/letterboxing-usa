                    <div class="plaintext-content">I drove to Maine on Monday to pick up son Peter, While there I <br/>
went up Cadillac Mtn. to check on my letterbox there. The bad news <br/>
was that no letterboxer had found it. The good news was that none of <br/>
the two to three million tourists who have walked by it over the past <br/>
seven weeks had found it either.<br/>
<br/>
I left another box at Thunder Hole. I'll to get the clues up soon.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone's summer is passing pleasantly.<br/>
