After 4 years and much nashing of teeth I have finally found someone at my new Girl Scout council to approve my letterboxing series of try-its, badges and interest patches (the awards for different levels of Girl Scouts).<br/>
<br/>
My question is how do I go about getting permission to use the LBNa logo?  Four years ago, I had talked to a woman at the LBNa website but many computers later, I do not have her information any more or a letter authorizing use.<br/>

I saw the TX LBNA patch and others so I see it's a possibility.<br/>

Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Once the badges have been designed, I would love to share the requirements for these awards with everyone.<br/>

Sorry--can't help you with the LbNA logo question, but I'm very interested in what you come up with for interest patches!  This year, our Juniors earned the Council's Own letterboxing badge from the VA Skyline Council, and we earned the CT letterboxing patch when we were brownies.  Some of the girls are bridging to Cadettes, and I'm sure they'd like to be able to earn another patch! <br/>

I sent an email to the Webmasters first before I found this yahoo group.  Unfortunately I never heard back from them prompting me to pose the question here.<br/>
<br/>
For all who are interested, I did get permission from AtlasQuest to use their AQ and chick logo.  If I get LBNa permission, that logo will be on one of the levels of the earned awards too.  My intent is that each level would have a different design encouraging the girls to come back as they move up an age group and letterbox again in more detail! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So...any suggestions for a design for the third award?  We were thinking of making it reflect our council.  My idea was a hand carving a diamond stamp, inked black of course ;-)<br/>

I am not a current LbNA webmaster, but I am the person who originally designed the graphics for the site, including the LbNA logo. You have my permission to use the LbNA logo for your badges and patches. If you need a signed statement to this effect, please feel free to contact me privately and I will send it to you.<br/>

Thank you for your efforts to get kids involved in letterboxing. It's a cause that is close to my heart.<br/>
