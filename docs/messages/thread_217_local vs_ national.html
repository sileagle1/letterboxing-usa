&gt;  always percolate up to a national forum.<br/>

I definitely agree with the above sentiments.  Let me specify that my<br/>
suggestion of creating 50 miniature mailing lists (one for each state) would<br/>
be ONLY for the purpose of allowing potential hobbyists to contact experienced<br/>
letterboxers in their area.  After making initial contact, newcomers should be<br/>
directed to our main list.  I wouldn't even recommend that we publish the<br/>
instructions for joining the smaller lists.  When someone expresses interest<br/>
in being a contact person for their state, we will just add them to the<br/>
recipient list for that group.  Newcomers would not actually join the state<br/>
contact mailing list, they would only be sending a message to it.<br/>

Good...  I reserve the right to add my .02 no matter where the question<br/>
comes from.  I'm a little uneasy with adding another layer of<br/>
letterboxing bureaucracy.  What is wrong with just listing those who<br/>
want to be contacted in a particular state? <br/>

&lt;&lt; What is wrong with just listing those who <br/>
want to be contacted in a particular state? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that is essentially what we are proposing, but with some minor<br/>
cosmetic adjustments.  My justification for doing it as proposed follows:<br/>
<br/>
1)  Conformity.  We already have the State Contacts map on the website.<br/>
People are used to it.  It looks nice.  It fits our map-related theme.  Most<br/>
people seem to like it.<br/>
<br/>
2)  User Friendly.  Providing a list address, rather than providing a page<br/>
full of individual addresses, makes it very easy for a newcomer to make<br/>
contact.  They just click on their home state.  An email form pops up, and<br/>
they type their message.  They only have to send this ONE SINGLE MESSAGE to<br/>
contact everyone in that state that has volunteered to help welcome<br/>
newcomers and get them started.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Security.  If you have ever checked out our online archive, you will see<br/>
that our email addresses are disguised.  Most of you are by now aware that<br/>
there are automatic ''spam-bots" out there that endlessly search the<br/>
internet for valid email addresses to send junk mail to.  By putting a<br/>
mailing list address on the webpage instead of our actual personal email<br/>
addresses, we can help prevent ourselves from becoming targets for<br/>
unsolicited commercial junk mail.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of clarification, let me explain how these smaller state lists<br/>
would work.  As you all know, the main Letterbox USA talk list (the one that<br/>
this message is being posted to) is configured so that when you reply to a<br/>
message, your reply is automatically sent to the entire group.  This is NOT<br/>
how the smaller lists would be set up, since they would be intended for<br/>
one-time initial contact only.  <br/>
<br/>
Let's say Thom and I are on the list as contact people for Oregon.  A<br/>
newcomer sends a message to that list.  Thom and I will both recieve the<br/>
message.  When Thom hits his REPLY button, by default his reply will ONLY be<br/>
sent to the newcomer.  It will not be sent to the list and forwarded to me<br/>
or any other members.  It will not be archived.  <br/>
<br/>
If the newcomer in turn responds to Thom's reply, again the message will go<br/>
to Thom ONLY.  Except for the initial contact request from the newcomer, all<br/>
other messages associated with this process will be PRIVATE conversations.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, the newcomer will not be added to the list.  Later, once he becomes<br/>
experienced, he can request to be added as a contact person, but this is not<br/>
required or automatic... it would be by special request only.  In other<br/>
words, what I am proposing is a ONE-WAY mailing list that could not possibly<br/>
function as a localized replacement for our main Letterbox USA talk list.<br/>

<br/>
It all sounds very nice....  I can see the benefits, but it still seems<br/>
like adding another layer to me.  Do what you will... my remarks are<br/>
inconsequential except to my own way of thinking.  In the long run, it<br/>
will not affect my letterboxing habits, so you have my full support. <br/>
