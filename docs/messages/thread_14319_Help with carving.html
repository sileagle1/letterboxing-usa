Are you using a inkjet printer or a laser printer?  The inkjet printings do not transfer as the laser ones do because the inkjet is ink and the laser printers are based on toner.  More than likely, I'd suspect you are using an inkjet printer and that's why it's not working.<br/>
<br/>
So, what you do is this (If you don't have a laser printer. [I myself have an old LaserJet III with a 90 dollar toner cartridge and all!]):<br/>
<br/>
Print the image using the inkjet and then trace over it with a dark #2 pencil, then transfer by using a coin or something like that. That will cause the graphite of the pencil lead to transfer off the image and onto the carving medium.<br/>

Well, that explains why I can't get the image to transfer, after<br/>
gassing myself all night with acetone. Well, not really, I am careful<br/>
*grin* I want to keep as many brain cells as possible.)  I just gently<br/>
rub the back of the tracing with my finger while holding it secure and<br/>
this is enough to transfer the image.  Then I ink over the image that<br/>
is now on the carving material with a black ink pen like a fine point<br/>
uni-ball which is waterproof &amp; fadeproof.  Now the image stays put as<br/>
I carve the stamp. When I cut, I use a speedball #1 blade without<br/>
putting it in the holder, this gives me complete control.  I'm very<br/>
nearsighted so I can see closeup w/o my glasses, some people get the<br/>
same results with a magnifyer. First I carve the hard part. Then carve<br/>
around all the design, after that I take out the big empty spaces with<br/>
either a speedball #5 "U" shaped blade or a speedball #2 "V"shaped<br/>
blade. The edges are the last to go &amp; are done just before mounting on<br/>
acrylic. During the process I check how the stamp looks with a stamp<br/>
pad that has ink that washes off. My first stamps were on erasers,<br/>
I've heard the mars stadtler is good, I don't remember what I used but<br/>
I do remember I went thru several because of mistakes - do expect it.<br/>
 You can buy the speedball blades at crafts stores like Michaels for<br/>
about $3-4 a pkg of 2-3 but look carefully at the condition of the<br/>
blades inside: some might be rusting or bent or mis-shaped ("they"<br/>
just don't make them the way they use to I guess).  I always sharpen<br/>
my speedball blades before each carving but I'm fussy and it's<br/>
probably not needed for a first time carver.  Michaels also sells<br/>
small sketch books for about $4.00 and Wal-mart has Rubbermaid<br/>
containers for $2-3.00.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">your wal-mart has small pads!  I'm ticked.  I've checked all over the store<br/>

<br/>
On carving-Pencil tracing works well.  If you want another option, make a<br/>
xerox of the image.  While it doesn't work as well (in my experience, but it<br/>
could just be my copy machine) as laser copies, it does still work.  You can<br/>
also iron on a low heat, not just acetone.  I've had mixed results with<br/>
both.  I prefer tracing if it isn't intricate, but I don't like it as much<br/>
if there are too many details.  Be careful with your heat on iron<br/>
transfers-don't touch the material directly.  I've found that some materials<br/>
melt easier than others when the heat is to high.<br/>
<br/>
Carving media can be many-from cheap pink erasers to Staedler-Mars Grand,<br/>
which I can't get in stores here and have to charge.  My happy medium has<br/>
been PZ Cut from a stamper's web page that's address is slipping my mind at<br/>
the moment, but many here can tell you.  The bigger craft stores also sell<br/>
"The Pink Stuff" not really called that, it's by Speedball.  Don't even try<br/>
the white stuff from speedball (both come it sheets).  It is a bunch of<br/>
crumbly junk (I'm editing here for other's sakes).<br/>

How about paying $1.79 for the Strathmore 300 series 3.5" x 5" sketch<br/>

Much better than the price at Michael's!! Buy 'em by the dozen.<br/>
