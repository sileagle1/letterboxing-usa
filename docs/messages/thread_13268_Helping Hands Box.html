                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Knitwit mom! It was great meeting everyone at the gathering and we are so <br/>
glad you are looking for our boxes!!  We get quite an immature little thrill <br/>
whenever we check our logbooks or get an email!  I guess our lives are <br/>
pretty dull -- but we LOVE it!<br/>
<br/>
I am behind on Helping Hands.  Thanks for the nudge.  I intend to select <br/>
more charities, starting with May (whoops -- a little late, but, better late <br/>
than ever).  As soon as school and its gazillion obligations are done (only <br/>
f---i----v-----e more days!) I will go through our charity file and choose <br/>
the new ones.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy the view when you go.  It is beautiful.  It really isn't <br/>
that far a walk (we made it with our kids and they "tire" pretty easily).  <br/>
If you are concerned about the length -- there is a short cut...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and have fun!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  The only problem we had with Candy Cane city was that we missed the <br/>
dirt trail after the paved trail.  We were thusly walking on the other side <br/>
of the trees.  We realized our mistake and crossed over.  Therefore, we <br/>
didn't get to see the cool "eyes" and all until the way back.  It was a fun <br/>
box to find and we appreciated the log to sit on and stamp in!<br/>
<br/>
To anyone who needs help on Candy Cane city -- we will gladly offer to help <br/>
in exchange for news on Glencaryln dog park!  Has anyone ever found this one <br/>
since the Fall?  I believe meandering Mermaid went looking for it and <br/>
couldn't find it recently.  It's a really cute stamp (saw it in Mary's book) <br/>
and we would love to find it.  I still contend that those mysterious newbies <br/>
are using it at their house....<br/>

&gt;Dear BeMa,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Had fun chatting at the gathering this weekend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Re my post tonight, KnitWit that I am, I realized that I'd been entering my <br/>
&gt;trail name, not my e-mail address into the e-mail box (oh, so *that's* why <br/>
&gt;it didn't work). Anyway, once I managed to get in, I modified the clue for <br/>
&gt;Candy Cane City--you may not have heard that discussion. Apparently Scarab <br/>
&gt;and Firefly tried to find it and couldn't. Turns out that they went on a <br/>
&gt;small dirt trail behind my white sign instead of on the main paved path. <br/>
&gt;(Glad you found it--made me feel less of an idiot!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I thought I'd play with the functions of the site and saw the search box <br/>
&gt;and decided to search for your boxes. They look like fun. We'll have to <br/>
&gt;make a trip to your area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I notice that Helping Hands "expired" in April--I seem to remember a web <br/>
&gt;posting about what you collected? It's such a neat idea. Would you consider <br/>
&gt;selecting other charities for other months this year? If so, let us know!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;KnitWit Mom<br/>
