                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations, John, on your new lettebox in Arizona! Sounds like a <br/>
fun one. It's up online for your review: please let me know if it <br/>
needs any tweaking. Just click on Arizona on the dot-org site. I <br/>
can't wait to someday get to AZ for some letterboxing and genealogy <br/>
(my family helped found Florence and lived in Tucson and Tombstone in <br/>
the early days). Good job!<br/>
<br/>
Also glad to see new letterboxes in Tolland CT, especially at <br/>
Soapstone Mountain, one of our favorite mountain biking thrash sites.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of hucking the bikes, we hope that Jolly GMan and family had <br/>
a great time in NH! Sorry we couldn't join you after all. We're <br/>
caught up in the usual summer staffing problems, sailing, sweating <br/>
out this east coast steam bath, you know...hope the mountains were <br/>
good to you.<br/>
<br/>
Jay in CT<br/>
