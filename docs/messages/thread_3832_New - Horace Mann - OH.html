Near Yellow Springs, Greene Co, OH<br/>
Difficulty: 1.5 (short walk in the park)<br/>

<br/>
Mann (1796-1859) was a pioneer in the reform of public education.  He <br/>
was a successful lawyer and politician in Massachusetts, establishing <br/>
the first State Board of Education.  It is likely because of this <br/>
man's dream, fulfilled in the common form of the strong local public <br/>
school district, that most of us learned how to read and write.  <br/>
<br/>
Mann's political career abruptly changed in 1850 when he was defeated <br/>
in a bid for the MA governorship.   Within the year, he was recruited <br/>
to become the first president of a university in the wilderness of <br/>
Ohio.  So it was that Mann became the president of Antioch College in <br/>
Yellow Springs.  <br/>
<br/>
Never very popular with the majority of the faculty, Mann served out <br/>
the rest of his life at Antioch, dying in office.  Much of his energy <br/>
was spent just getting the college to build a house for his family.  <br/>
(Sound a little like the King and I?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An alum of the college brought to fulfillment the long held notion of <br/>
a monument to Mann in 1937.  He owned the original Mann farm and had <br/>
a bronze statue on a granite dais erected on the site of the old <br/>
farm.  Then he donated the land to the university.  This is where we <br/>
get involved in the letterbox - because the monument to Mann is in <br/>
the middle of the woods, miles from the campus!<br/>
<br/>
The monument is still there, much worse for the wear, with <br/>
generations of vandals upsetting much of the dais (and recently <br/>
having painted his shoes red for some reason!)   Saplings grow <br/>
between the cracks in the granite stones.  It has looked forlorn for <br/>
many years, and was the germinal protoform for one of Rod Sterling's <br/>
Twilight Zone episodes  "Changing of the Guard."  (Sterling was a <br/>
1950 graduate of the college.)<br/>
<br/>
Park in a lot in John Bryan State Park.  You can park at the office, <br/>
or if the campground is not busy, you may be able to park there for a <br/>
short time.  Walk SW on John Bryan Park Road.  Turn left (SE) at the <br/>
second road on the left.  A gate blocks this drive.  Walk across the <br/>
field and you will see the statue rising from the field against the <br/>
trees at the far side of the meadow.   Coordinates are N39.7855 <br/>
W83.8700.  You can download a topographic map of the area at <br/>
www.topozone.com using these coordinates.  The monument is clearly <br/>
marked on the map.  <br/>
<br/>
To find this box, approach the statue with a mixture awe and <br/>
confusion.  Take in the stern countenance of the president, and the <br/>
inexplicable red shoes.  Pass the statue and exit the dais on the <br/>
rear steps.  Take the small path in front of you and 21 paces past <br/>
the statue (1 pace = 2 steps) down the path stop at the first sizable <br/>
tree.  <br/>
<br/>
The Horace Mann letterbox lies at rest under the rock beside that <br/>
tree.<br/>
<br/>
Take a moment to think about the resources invested in this relic <br/>
from years gone by  the small esteem now afforded to men that loomed <br/>
large in their day  and the consequences of nearly inevitable <br/>
historical obscurity.   For me, these thoughts show the folly of <br/>
neglecting family while working too much overtime to make a name for <br/>
myself. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this unique "twilight zone" will bring other truths to your <br/>
understanding.  If you learn anything else, feel free to email me <br/>
