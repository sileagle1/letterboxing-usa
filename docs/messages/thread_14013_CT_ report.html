Bluebird and I got out to a few boxes yesterday.  Every time we 'finish' <br/>
up Coventry~~ out pops some new ones. ! So off we went, stopped in <br/>
Columbia for the new Rec. Park, all is well and it was a beautiful magic <br/>
walk among ferns the whole way. Picked up the H.H. "Big Foot Without <br/>
Socks"  and then off to Coventry.  Found the Lovely Stamp "Eternal Love" <br/>
and then went in search of the John Wayne Series.  These stamps are also <br/>
great. How do they DO it ?? I am still in the beginning carvers 'class' <br/>
 so am in awe of these creations.  We left the Big Foot H.H. off to <br/>
travel and picked up two more H.H. !! I brought the "Roarin' Roadster" <br/>
home to visit the Inn at the Beginning for lunch before I send it on its <br/>
way.  That is one busy H.H.  Bluebird took the H.H. Pandora's box home <br/>
and will send that off also.  A nice day, fun in the woods and a thank <br/>
you to the box placers.<br/>
