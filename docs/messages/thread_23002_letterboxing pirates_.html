Tempter)not more than two weeks ago, and went back to rebag one,  and<br/>
we found it out in the open, on the ground with the stamp missing.At<br/>

It sounds like kids. <br/>
<br/>
When planting a box, follow the hints derived from the Lost Box <br/>
Survey (see Files section):<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-usa/files/Lost%20Box%20Survey/<br/>
<br/>
Hide the box so that it is easily re-hidden (don't rely on sticks and <br/>
leaves), put the box in a camo burlap bag, pick a location that is <br/>
well off the path and obscured from the view of passers-by (inside a <br/>
bunch of bushes).<br/>

I agree I do not think it was geocachers, as I thinkgeocachers are <br/>
1. pretty strict about leaving something in place of, and<br/>
2.rehiding<br/>
<br/>
We will not give up hiding, but will have to watch our others.<br/>
<br/>
And there really was no need for camo or burlap on this one, seriously,<br/>
it ws tucked inside of a burned out stump up the side of it, not at<br/>
the base. And I do mean tucked inside.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well, I do hope they are enjoying their new stamp.<br/>
No idea what someone would really want with it.<br/>
hmmm, maybe I should check eBay ha ha!!!<br/>
perhaps there is a category for handcarved letterbox stamps?<br/>

<br/>
Also, geocachers have to deal with the same issue: people taking <br/>
geocaches.  So I think it a bit off to try to blame them/us. GCers <br/>
even have a term for it: 'muggled'.  GCers call non-GCers 'muggles' <br/>
(term from Harry Potter books/movies).  Combine that with mugged, and <br/>
you have muggled. :)<br/>
<br/>
Most GCers don't like it.  While they haven't invested in a <br/>
handcarved stamp etc, they have invested in a container, logbook, <br/>
swag, etc, and that can be a little costly, especially when you <br/>
factor in possible travel bugs/geocoins, etc that were in the <br/>
geocache that was muggled and are irreplacable.<br/>
