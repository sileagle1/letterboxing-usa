the bridge from Lubec, Maine.</p><b>

<p align="left">Annabelle Jane Fletcher was my aunt and most importantly my 
friend. I place this letterbox on her island where she was born, raised and 
lived. She worked faithfully at Roosevelt Park in the "Prince Cottage" for many 
years. Make sure you stop by for a visit. It is free of charge and she would 
have loved to show you around "her park". </p>
<p align="left">Aunt Belle and I made this walk many times. I am sure you can 
still hear us giggling and chatting if you listen close enough.</p>

</b><p align="center">Clues: </p>
<p align="left">Cross the bridge from Lubec, Maine to Campobello, Island, New 
Brunswick, Canada. Stop at the border crossing (note: this is not a toll booth, 
many people think it is! You are entering Canada - the border officials are 
really nice - just tell them you are visiting Roosevelt Park for the day - dont 
forget identification i.e. drivers license or birth certificate).</p>
<p align="left">After you pass through the border proceed to Herring Cove by going 
straight. You will pass Rosevlet Park on your left (Franklin Delano Roosevelts 
summer home - you may want to visit here before or after your walk - its free!) 
Proceed 1.5 km (about 3/4 mile) past the Roosevlet Park entrance. You will come 
to an intersection, turn right. The next road you see will see is the Herring 
Cove Road (about a 1/2 mile from the intersection) take this right. Proceed to 
the end of this road (pass the Herring Cove Golf Course &amp; Herring Cove 
Campground). Park at Herring Cove Beach. Face the sea from the parking lot, 
there is a path that leads to your left. Walk up this trail and you will soon 
see another trail leading to your right which is the Herring Cove Overlook. Look 
under the set of steps leading to the overlook. There awaits your prize!!</p>
