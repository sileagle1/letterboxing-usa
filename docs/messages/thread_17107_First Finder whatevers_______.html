had planned to place inside each box its corresponding fishing <br/>
lure.  After I made the boxes I changed my mind-- I mean how could I <br/>
give up my favorite lures!!?! Come on, I was already letting my <br/>
secrets out about what lure works well in the area I had placed the <br/>
box, giving the lure too would be almost as bad as handing a fish to <br/>
someone.  Its a good thing I reconsidered and decided to place the <br/>
series in one park instead of all over the 3 counties.  <br/>

Many boxes do not have a first find whatever in them (the few I have been<br/>
first on at least) which is fine  Sometimes it is the race to be first that<br/>
is reward lol.<br/>
<br/>
However, one of our esteemed boxers placed origami sailboats in a box of the<br/>
same name.  That was neat--as was the fact that the first finder left a few<br/>
there for my kdis, knowing we woudl be not far behind her.<br/>
<br/>
I like hte card idea also--I am an avid scrapbooker and those little things<br/>
add to my logbook in a unique way.<br/>

&gt; things do you place in them??  I've very, very interested in<br/>
&gt; hearing what everyone else is using.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the more interesting things I've seen in boxes for <br/>
the first finders:<br/>
<br/>
A Lewis &amp; Clark peace coin in a Lewis &amp; Clark themed letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Funhog had been placing small, glass figurines (in the shape of a <br/>
hog!) for first finders.  (She must have run out of those years ago, <br/>
though, since I haven't heard about them in a long time.)<br/>
<br/>
One box I found on the east coast had a bunch of pins for wearing <br/>
(six of them).  They weren't meant for "first finders" since the pins <br/>
were placed long after the box was originally placed, but it could <br/>
have been left for first finders as well.<br/>
<br/>
One of my boxes was found by a geocacher and they e-mailed me to let <br/>
me know that found it and was interested in the letterboxing hobby, <br/>
but they left a small airplane in it specifically for me the next <br/>
time I checked up on it.  I never have checked up on it since, but <br/>
another letterboxer later e-mailed me saying that they found the box <br/>
with their child who was absolutely thrilled to death to find that <br/>
little plane in it.  (Which was okay by me, because I didn't really <br/>
want the plane in the first place and loved the idea that it would <br/>
put a smile on a kids face.)  Again, it wasn't put in there with the <br/>
first finder in mind, but it could have been.<br/>
<br/>
But be creative.  Darned near ANYTHING could be left in a box for the <br/>
first finders.  Or even for ALL finders.  =)<br/>

We're rarely that organized to do anything special for first finder <br/>
recognition in our own newly placed letterboxes, but we have come <br/>
across a few neat things in other letterboxes along the way:<br/>
<br/>
--a newly launched hitchhiker letterbox<br/>
--tiny origami paper cranes in a multitude of colors<br/>
--little congratulatory 'first finder' certificates<br/>
--a little trinket or two such as a pin or a nice pebble, piece of <br/>
obsidian or some sort of other natural treasure found in the area<br/>

I haven't placed anything in my LBs for 1st Finders, but I think <br/>
I'll start doing so; I like the idea. Gnosis 4-H left "First Finder" <br/>
certificates in five of their boxes that I've found, and The <br/>
Mandrill left a small keychain in the Mt. Lee LB.  I've also found <br/>
little plastic easter eggs contianing stickers in Hamish MacBeth, <br/>
Cousin Knueppe, and Adam Ant boxes. (All these boxes are in Southern <br/>
California.)<br/>

I've created a few boxes with themes kids will enjoy (This Little <br/>
Pig, Find-Me Frog, Misplaced Marbles, all in western MA) in <br/>
which I've put souvenirs for the first 10 finders.  I get the <br/>
inexpensive souvenirs (tiny plastic pigs, marbles, and plastic <br/>
frogs) at a local store. Sometimes I replenish the supply when I <br/>
check on the box!<br/>
<br/>
In my Goodnough Dike box at the Quabbin Reservoir (western <br/>
MA), I put small photos (about 2" x 3") of the view from the dike in <br/>
the box for the first three finders.  The idea was that finders could <br/>
paste the photo in their logbook.<br/>

Thank you all who do this.  Whiel I never expect anything for being a first<br/>
finder,  and am never disappointed to "not" get something, it is always nice<br/>
to find that extra surprise.<br/>

Was this directed to me?  If so, I humbly apologize for the ommission.  I'm <br/>
in Florida, and South Florida, at that.  We do look forward to the yearly <br/>
influx of snowbirds, though, so feel free to join us and give my travel bug a ride!<br/>

In one of my boxes (Hitchhiking Ghost), I put a first-finder card with a copy of the stamp image on green vellum to make it translucent like a ghost.<br/>
