Thank you Pete and Wanda for traveling down to join us and also thank you <br/>
Alan from Connecticut for making the journey, it was great to meet you!!  <br/>
'Box On!!!!<br/>
The "Perfect Circle" is "perfect"!! What a pleasure to meet you all!<br/>
Our surprise boxer was "Mapsurfer". A man of mystery and keeper of <br/>
secrets...<br/>
I look forward to hiking with "M&amp;P" in the near future, let's do it.<br/>

<br/>Thanks for everything.
<br/>
<br/>Looking forward to meeting you all again soon, maybe this time on the trail.
