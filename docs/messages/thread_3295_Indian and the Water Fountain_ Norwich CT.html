Larry Boy, Dino Boy, Baby Brother Bear and I spent a wonderful breezy late <br/>
afternoon in Mohegan Park on a letterbox hunt.  What a great park!  We <br/>
couldn't find box #2.  We spent quite a while looking and checked out every <br/>
stump in the area.  The other 3 boxes are fine.  Box 4 was a little bit damp <br/>
but not too bad.  We enjoyed our afternoon very much!<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just wanted to report the first box in Aix sponsa walk is missing.<br/>
&gt;According to the second box on the route, it has been missing for a while -<br/>
&gt;just making sure it was reported. The second box is  intact, but really,<br/>
&gt;really hard to find!<br/>

&gt;Hello,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Chip, the Letter to a Traitor places were wonderful and so full of history.<br/>
&gt;I have never been to either fort (I am ashamed to say) and really enjoyed<br/>
&gt;the area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;However, the second box, at Fort Trumbull appears to be missing.  We<br/>
&gt;searched and searched the sea wall, and after a couple of really good<br/>
&gt;smashed fingers, and a giant gash on my leg (don't worry - it didn't bleed<br/>
&gt;long - hee  hee), we finally gave up.  I know we were in the right place -<br/>
&gt;the clues were specific.  I am sure you did not mean for people to be<br/>
&gt;moving huge, giant boulders to get to the box - right?  I was unable to<br/>
&gt;anyway!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have you heard anything before on this box missing?  Anyway, really enjoyed<br/>
&gt;the history lesson.<br/>

&gt;I know we were dogging your footsteps at every box in the New London area<br/>
&gt;on Saturday - must have been missing you by mere minutes!!!!  You didn't<br/>
&gt;know we were following you!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Did you find the box at Fort Trumbull - or am I correct in thinking it is<br/>
&gt;really truly gone?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hope you had a great letterbox day in Connecticut - couldn't have asked for<br/>
&gt;a better day weather wise!!<br/>

&gt;Thanks,Tom.  Webmasters, I have deleted that page/clue. I've also<br/>

&gt;Subject: Boxes in the New London Area<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wow. I never knew that a fellow letterboxer was just a few minutes behind <br/>
&gt;me on Saturday. I had a great day picking up most of the boxes in the area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Harley's Hex - Great Mysterious Place. Letterbox is fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Grey Rock - Both boxes are intact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Barking Eagle - Coast Guard Academy. What a place. Though I did have to <br/>
&gt;patiently wait an hour for a wedding photo session to conclude. Seem like <br/>
&gt;the gazebo is a favorite place for wedding photos.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Connecticut Arboretum - Great Walk. Keeps you on your Compass reading toes. <br/>
&gt;Box is fine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Forts Griswold and Trumbel. Neat places for a history buff. Both boxes are <br/>
&gt;there. Fort Tremble does have two flat rocks with a hole in them. Can be <br/>
&gt;misleading at first. Elizabeth, please do try again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Elaine and Jerry's Bluff. Found the spot, but could not find the box. I <br/>
&gt;know it is probably there and will return in the winter when the vegetation <br/>
&gt;is much more sparse. Did find the Two Labs &amp; A Box Mystery Location though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All in all, a very good day.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;btw. YIMS [you inspire my spirit] and I are heading off to New Mexico. <br/>
&gt;Hopefully we will find a few and quite likely plant a few too.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi, Elizabeth! I just checked on Aix sponsa while doing "Bridges of<br/>
&gt;Pequot Woods" (whose clues are not online but available at EMS) maybe<br/>
&gt;3 weeks ago and both boxes were safely in their nests. I did see the<br/>
&gt;message in the second box about the first being missing. Maybe we<br/>
&gt;need to re-read the clues since both are meant to be easy boxes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry to hear that you couldn't find Fort Trumbull: alot of these<br/>
&gt;close-to-the-water's-edge boxes are floating off and we've resolved<br/>
&gt;not to plant any more. We'll try to stop by later in the week and<br/>
&gt;check on that one.<br/>

&gt;Hi Jay<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The only way that the Fort Trumbel Letterbox will float away is if we have <br/>
&gt;a 300 year hurricane.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Average accuracy of 10m; average elevation of 47m.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Geocache/Letterbox hybrid in Agrignon Park in Montreal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Iced tea is a personal trademark. However, this cache, like my previous,<br/>
&gt;doesn't contain<br/>
&gt;any iced tea for fear of freezing and thirsty nonhuman animals. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Geocache/Letterbox hybrid. Right now that means it contains a stamp, but<br/>
&gt;please bring<br/>
&gt;your own inkpad!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The terrain is reasonably dog friendly, but is the type of public city park<br/>
&gt;that has<br/>
&gt;garbage here and there, so watch their paws. Plenty of trails you *can* but<br/>
&gt;don't *have*<br/>
&gt;to use, but not will be more challenging for the smaller dogs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Eventually the raw data for my readings will be available from www.malak.ca<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Initial contents:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Logbook, pen &amp; pencil, and stamp -- SVP ecrire en francais s'il vous<br/>

&gt;3 packages of firstarters<br/>
&gt;1 Canada headgear/sunshade<br/>
&gt;1 pack fridge magnet clips<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Plastic Bags for cache in/trash out -- no need to leave anything for a<br/>
&gt;plastic bag. But<br/>
&gt;you're invited to leave more bags if you wish. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When I placed the cache, I could have taken out three bags instead of one<br/>
&gt;without effort<br/>
&gt;had I had the bags! When I went back (and met a geoseeker) I brought out<br/>
&gt;two more bags.<br/>
&gt;Could have still brought out a few more had I been so inclined. :(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Roughly 270 metres from NW end of the pond. You figure out the direction. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi, Elizabeth! I just checked on Aix sponsa while doing "Bridges of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pequot Woods" (whose clues are not online but available at EMS) maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3 weeks ago and both boxes were safely in their nests. I did see the<br/>
&gt; &gt; message in the second box about the first being missing. Maybe we<br/>
&gt; &gt; need to re-read the clues since both are meant to be easy boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi Jay!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;"Frogger" and I were at Aix sponsa on April 22 and the first box was<br/>
&gt;intact at that point; if fact, it was left with some company (I think a<br/>
&gt;cat was prowling around the nest - hint, hint).  I am ashamed to say<br/>
&gt;that we did not find the second box even though the clues were pretty<br/>
&gt;straight forward.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Today was a day of drive-by boxes for us.  We stamped in on the last<br/>
&gt;page of the Big Sugar Maple Letterbox log book.  I would have replace<br/>
&gt;the log but we brought only the bare minimum supplies as we knew we<br/>
&gt;would be driving through the area.  It is a popular "first letterbox"<br/>
&gt;for many.  We also "Zoomed" to Essex for another quick stop.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We hope this weather keeps up far into the fall!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, okay guys - if you say so!!! I swear we were in the right place for<br/>
&gt;the first Aix sponsa  -we actually did see a depression in the ground (box<br/>
&gt;size) so thought it was gone.  Also, because the second boxes book seems to<br/>
&gt;confirm this, I thought I was safe reporting it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for Fort Trumbull, found the two flat rocks with the holes in them,<br/>
&gt;where is the box?  LoneMassWolf, do you have to move big boulders to get at<br/>
&gt;it?  Darn! I hate it when I can not track it down.  ( Okay, I did have sort<br/>
&gt;of an excuse - some Navy guys came out and wanted to know what I was doing<br/>
&gt;and if I needed a bandage - really there was not THAT much blood) - so I<br/>
&gt;sort of got distracted!  I am definitely going to try BOTH again - never<br/>
&gt;surrender, never say die!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tom,  I guess you were right.  This was a good lesson on reporting missing<br/>
&gt;boxes and listing them - still - we did get people confirming they weren't<br/>
&gt;actually missing - so maybe this is the way to keep track?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And for anyone, did Oma's Outlook today!  What a beautiful hike and the<br/>
&gt;vista is incredible!!  If you get the chance - please go - this one is not<br/>
&gt;to be missed.  Had a great day, went for ride after boxing and finished off<br/>
&gt;at our favorite place, the Book Barn in Niantic.  It just doesn't get any<br/>
&gt;better than today.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Happy, tired and content in Connecticut<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;BOK TOWER GARDENS is a national historic landmark located at the summit of<br/>
&gt;Iron Mountain in central Florida.  With its serene gardens, vast wildlife,<br/>
&gt;gentle solitude and beauty, it is said to be: "a glorious tapestry of<br/>
&gt;nature."   There are numerous paths to explore and one could spend several<br/>
&gt;hours ambling and not see it all!  BOKs centerpiece, the Carillon Tower,<br/>
&gt;reigns over the highest point in Florida.  Here the views of the <br/>
&gt;countryside<br/>
&gt;are phenomenal!  The carillon strikes each 1/2 hr. followed by a chorus of<br/>
&gt;the bells.  At 3:00 on most days, you can hear a LIVE recital by the <br/>
&gt;resident<br/>
&gt;carillonneur.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The Gardens website is linked above.  It will provide you with a map for<br/>
&gt;directions to the property, along with a tremendous amount of other<br/>
&gt;information.  Check it out!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Please enter the grounds on foot through the new Education and Visitor <br/>
&gt;Center<br/>
&gt;Complex.  You may wish to visit the Orientation Theater, Exhibit Hall, or <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;Carillon Cafe.  Both the Gift Shop and the Plant Shop are wonderful, and <br/>
&gt;may<br/>
&gt;be best left for the end.   Ready to start now??<br/>
&gt;__________________________________________________________________<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BOK Letterbox #1:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;First, seek out the small statue of St. Francis feeding the birds.  Which <br/>
&gt;way<br/>
&gt;does his face point?  Follow in the direction of his nose as he is telling<br/>
&gt;you which pathway to take next.  When strolling this pathway, you will be<br/>
&gt;passing by a bench dedicated to "Judge Warlow," and you will arrive at a<br/>
&gt;`T. Both routes are very scenic, but if its the letterbox youre after,<br/>
&gt;choosing the path to the right will be wrong for now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Take three dozen paces down the mulched path and you will find a secluded<br/>
&gt;seating area on your left.  Enter that area and rest on the black wrought<br/>
&gt;iron park bench.  In the 12 o'clock position you will see a medium-sized<br/>
&gt;magnolia tree.  Past it, at 11 o'clock position, grows a giant live oak <br/>
&gt;tree,<br/>
&gt;surrounded by a palm tree and other greenery.  Discretely, check out the <br/>
&gt;base<br/>
&gt;of the palm tree.  Did you find what you were seeking?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You may wish to go back to the bench to stamp logs, write us a note, etc.  <br/>
&gt;Ple<br/>
&gt;ase replace the box as you found it while passersby are not looking! This <br/>
&gt;can<br/>
&gt;be a very popular, busy place from January-April, especially.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you wish to continue looking for letterbox #2 at this time, we suggest <br/>
&gt;you<br/>
&gt;return on the same footpaths just taken until you find the bench dedicated <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;`Mrs. T. P. Wallow, Sr. Sit on the bench.  After resting a bit, follow the<br/>
&gt;short path directly ahead leading to a gate. Pausing at that gate, you will<br/>
&gt;find a very special view of Historic Pinewood Estate. (Notes about this<br/>
&gt;secluded property are found in your Guide Map.)  While there are other <br/>
&gt;routes<br/>
&gt;to take to seek box #2, we thought you should not go home without at least<br/>
&gt;peeking at this lovely, Mediterranean-revival showcase.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;BOK Letterbox #2:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Find Exedra and the Sunset Overlook.  This area is the highest point in<br/>
&gt;Florida!!  Isnt it beautiful?  When youre ready to leave this <br/>
&gt;breathtaking<br/>
&gt;view, take one of the mulched paths due south.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Look for a short westardly path off this main path. It leads you to a<br/>
&gt;monument with dove carvings which is a tribute to Edward Bok.  After taking <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;moment to enjoy this monument, walk to the left side of it and go BEHIND <br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
&gt;(A route taken only by a few people!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Proceed walking west through a small parking area.  Ahead of you lies an<br/>
&gt;older building (former Education Center). Walk to the left side of the<br/>
&gt;building, past the short, black chainlink fencing, and down the old steps.<br/>
&gt;(Anyone looking??)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At the landing of these steps you will find yet another overwhelming view.<br/>
&gt;Look at all the space!  Notice all the live oak trees with dead cypress<br/>
&gt;hanging down?  The live oak with a "snag'" is the one to go to.  (Refer to<br/>
&gt;'The Knoll' in your GuideMap to see a picture of a snag!)  At it's base is <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;long log of one of the old trees.  Which end holds Letterbox #2??  (Be<br/>
&gt;careful; it's shoved in quite aways.  Need a stick?  Any animals living in<br/>
&gt;there?)  Enjoy stamping and returning it safely.  Thanks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have you heard the Singing Tower yet?  You may get to the back side of the<br/>
&gt;tower by taking a much less populated route: simply proceed south from<br/>
&gt;letterbox #2 site, along the vast lawned area and climb up the short hill <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;the towers oak grove.  You have now arrived at one of the Gardens quiet<br/>
&gt;listening areas.  Relax and enjoy!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As you leave the Tower area to complete your explorations, dont forget to<br/>
&gt;view the various angles of the Reflection Pool (Circle 2 on the GuideMap.)<br/>
&gt;Have you seen the family of swans in residence there?  Most people dont <br/>
&gt;know<br/>
&gt;they exist.  Shh-h-h.  Its special!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If your time (and energy level) allows, you should see circled areas 11 and<br/>
&gt;12.  The Preserve Trail is a 1/2 hr. walk through a longleaf pine forest <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;shaded benches and signs posted to guide you on your observations of the<br/>
&gt;natural Central Florida Ridge ecosystem.  Did you take time to go to The<br/>
&gt;Knoll?  (Circle 13).  You won't be sorry.  This trail terminates at the<br/>
&gt;parking area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We hope you have had an enjoyable day.  Comments are always welcomed in the<br/>
&gt;log books or at our websites above.<br/>

&gt;Subject: New Letterboxes--Oregon<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This weekend the YaYa Girls had a rendezvous at Camp Sherman, Jefferson<br/>
&gt;County, Oregon. The group came from locales as diverse as Chicago,<br/>
&gt;Australia and Portland. We celebrated our friendship by planting The<br/>
&gt;YaYa Letterboxes along the Metolius River. These are the clues to our<br/>
&gt;four works of art placed September 7-9, 2001.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To the trailhead for the Camp Sherman and Night and Day Letterboxes:<br/>
&gt;Take route 20 to the turnoff for Camp Sherman 12 miles west of Sisters,<br/>
&gt;Oregon. Go North and park at the Camp Sherman store.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To the Letterboxes:<br/>
&gt;Night and Day Letterbox:  Walk downstream on the East Metolius Trail.<br/>
&gt;You will pass a campground and a wooden bench.  When the trail meets a<br/>
&gt;pullout on the road, you will see a single Ponderosa Pine on the left.<br/>
&gt;Continue 33 paces.  You will pass Siamese Twins.  Just beyond them is a<br/>
&gt;small rotting tree stump on your left.  The letterbox is resting quietly<br/>
&gt;beneath broken wood and pine needles.  This is a fifteen minute walk<br/>
&gt;from the Camp Sherman store; letterbox created by YumYum YaYa.<br/>
&gt;Camp Sherman Letterbox:  Walk upstream to the head of the Metolius<br/>
&gt;River.  After reveling in the amazement of a full blown river springing<br/>
&gt;from the earth, and being charmed by the incredibly cute rodent<br/>
&gt;population, head back to the parking lot.  Forty-five paces beyond the<br/>
&gt;end of the rail fence on the exit road, take the trail at 300 degrees<br/>
&gt;(magnetic.)  Keep the barbed wire fence and power lines on your left.<br/>
&gt;Stop at the green metal gate.  At 110 degrees you will see a stump.<br/>
&gt;Walk 46 paces and slide out the removable door.  Stamp in, please!  This<br/>
&gt;is a 50 minute walk from the Camp Sherman store; letterbox created by<br/>
&gt;Eco YaYa.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To the trailhead for the Metolius River and Black Butte Letterboxes:<br/>
&gt;Take Route 20 to the turnoff for Camp Sherman 12 miles west of Sisters,<br/>
&gt;Oregon. Go North to the junction with Forest Service Road 1420.<br/>
&gt;Continue straight on 1420 to Lower Canyon Creek Campground.  Park at the<br/>
&gt;West Metolius Trailhead and head for Wizard Falls.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Black Butte Letterbox:  Walk downstream on the West Metolius Trail to<br/>
&gt;the first cedar tree on the right side of the path.  Just ahead of you<br/>
&gt;will be a large Ponderosa Pine on the left, with a fallen friend just<br/>
&gt;beyond.  Go behind the live one and look beneath the fallen one for your<br/>
&gt;stamp.  This is a five minute walk; letterbox created by Yowah YaYa.<br/>
&gt;Metolius River Letterbox:<br/>
&gt;After youve toured the hatching tanks,<br/>
&gt;go back upstream and cross two planks.<br/>
&gt;Just beyond them you will see,<br/>
&gt;the greyed remains of a sawn off tree.<br/>
&gt;He gazes out from two eyes,<br/>
&gt;and stands just under five feet in size.<br/>
&gt;In the place of curly locks,<br/>
&gt;You will find this letterbox<br/>
&gt;This is a two and a half mile walk; letterbox created by YeeHa YaYa.<br/>
&gt;(NOTE:  Both the Camp Sherman and Metolius River letterboxes have<br/>
&gt;shorter hiking alternatives.  Please consult your map.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Happy Trails!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just a note to say that the letterboxes in Harbison State Park are<br/>
&gt;alive and well.  A wonderful hike, saw several deer on the day that I<br/>
&gt;was there.  I wasn't the first person to stamp into  #1, but I was<br/>
&gt;the first to go to #2, #3, and #4.  I also picked up the "Escaped<br/>
&gt;Ape" hitchhiker! It was a lovely day!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks LadyBug!<br/>
