   Anyway is acceptable, I heard of someone making a scrapbook with <br/>
bits of trail memorabilia and photos of locations along with stamp <br/>
image. I used a little memo book and have recently changed to a bound <br/>
scetch book from Walden books.  I keep it in a large ziploc in my <br/>
backpack.  The nice thing about this hobby is the open format so if <br/>
it suits you enjoy it!     Carol- Leader of the pack<br/>

I do the exact same thing. I carry around 3x5 cards<br/>
stamp one side and write on the other. I then place<br/>
them in a photo album that allows you to slide the<br/>
picture into the slot, and right behind the stamp I<br/>
place the clues. This works for me.<br/>

<br/>
I think your system sounds great!  Everyone has their own way of<br/>
recording their placed and Finds.  Some people take photos of the places<br/>
they've been to, along next to the stamp image itself in their logbooks.<br/>
Some write extensive notes about their experience that day or the hike<br/>
itself.  Some just stamp it and put the date and place.  Whatever is<br/>
most valuable to you.  There is no wrong way.  It's a very individual<br/>
thing!  Do what suits you personally.<br/>
<br/>
