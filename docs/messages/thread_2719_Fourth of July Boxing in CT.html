&gt;  Hope everyone else took advantage of their day off!<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed our day off climbing up and down the ridges in Southington, CT and collecting stamp images from 5 of the 6 ESAK boxes.  Great stamps ESAK.  There has been some logging at the beginning of the way to Sunset Rock but we got there following a pinkish path a little above the south shore of the reservoir.  We have also found Jay Drew's boxes at Thrill Ride and Barb &amp; Larry's Ledge.  All were in good shape and waiting for more visitors.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  ESAK asks "If anyone knows of any of these [New London County, CT] boxes that may be out of commission, please let us know.  "<br/>
<br/>
We have been to all these boxes over the last couple of months and found them in good condition.  I don't recall any problems with finding them as there wasn't anything particularly tricky in the clues.  The areas are all delightful walks.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we had great "sailing" weather the day before in Newport, RI.<br/>

We are very happy you enjoyed our boxes. Yes the logging has made it tricky<br/>
to navigate the trails at Sunset Rock. Thanks for the info on the New London<br/>
County boxes also. We have been busy carving more stamps to hide and have<br/>
scoped out some very interesting locations. We'll be hiding those upon our<br/>
return.<br/>
