20030523<br/>
<br/>
Along the Way (Port Mahon, DE): In place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
20030524<br/>
<br/>
Vanderbilt series (Hyde Park, NY): All four boxes in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
20030525<br/>
<br/>
Seamon Park (Saugerties, NY): both boxes in place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Poet's Walk (Red Hook, NY): In place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
20030527<br/>
<br/>
Carolina South (Richmond, RI): In place, dry, and intact.<br/>
<br/>
Wizard of Oz series (Richmond, RI): Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion are <br/>
in place and intact.  The Tin Man box was a little wet inside, but the <br/>
contents were safe inside plastic bags.<br/>
<br/>
We had come back to finish the Oz series this visit, but had a scary, <br/>
unfortunate encounter with a fellow hiker. We had brought the Nina dog with us this <br/>
trip. A woman came along with two big dogs. They were a bit too much for her to <br/>
handle and one got  the better of her and bit Nina pretty good. The poor <br/>
woman got bitten several times trying to get her dog off. Nina needed stitches and <br/>
the poor woman was absolutely horrified and apologized up and down (while <br/>
searching for her wedding ring she lost in the scuffle...thankfully she found <br/>
it). I tried to give her first aid while Christopher held the offending dog, but <br/>
all she wanted to do was get herself and the dogs home (they were dragging her <br/>
all over). I'm sure both of our dogs believe they saved us from some great <br/>
evil. Nina slept all the way to the vet's. So our boxing quest for today was cut <br/>
short, but we are just thankful it wasn't worse. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Quite an experience with those dogs!  One of the hazards of lbing. Only<br/>
one in 100 dogs on the average (my statistics) will be that way. Our dog<br/>
"Bud" (he's blind) usually stops in his tracks and lets other dogs smell<br/>
him out, but a small few are hostile from the start. You probably will<br/>
not encounter such a situation again in your travels but if you do I was<br/>
thinking that a small plastic tarp that could be carried and used as a<br/>
shield ( like a matador uses) would be good to include in your lbing<br/>
kits.<br/>
<br/>
P.S.    Missed a lot over the past few days because we were bounced off<br/>
of  this yahoo site. But we are back in the loop again.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking of putting letters on the back of my pickup truck spelling<br/>
leterboxing.org and having a silk screened tee shirt with the same on<br/>
it....   Please Sun Shine in NY again........Happy letterboxing!!!       <br/>

While on the search at Stanley Park in Westfield MA, 3 horses came <br/>
around the bend with riders on them. Very tall as horses go!  The <br/>
first 2 went right by me in the other direction.  The 3rd had <br/>
different ideas.  He started and turned after me.!! The rider got the <br/>
horse under control and off I went...In back tracking after locating <br/>
the box we met in the same spot once more.  I gave the horse <br/>
additional room on this dirt road and stood very still. This time the <br/>
horse did not bother me. I guess it was okay now that I had stamped <br/>
in!!<br/>
