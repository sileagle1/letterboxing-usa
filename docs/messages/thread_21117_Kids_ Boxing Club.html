A little cross posting here, but I was kind of excited about this!<br/>
<br/>
Some of the kids from my elementary schools (I travel) have really <br/>
started to get involved in letterboxing, in and out of school. It <br/>
started with my personal traveler, which I hid a few different times <br/>
in the building and let them find during their free time. Then they <br/>
started wanting to see our logbook and hear stories about where the <br/>
Highlander and I had been over the weekends. Now they're taking their <br/>
own recess time to MAKE stamps and scope Atlas Quest, so I'm looking <br/>
forward to seeing where they end up placing their boxes. <br/>
<br/>
It's basically only 1-5 kids at each building, but it's starting to <br/>
look like an unofficial club (even though most of them don't even <br/>
know each other). So, I'm unofficially planning a small box hunt for <br/>
them at the park where 19 boxes from the WNY Gathering were<br/>
(unofficially means I'll tell kids where we'll be and anyone who <br/>
shows up and stays with a parent or guardian wiil be there...that way <br/>
I don't get in trouble for planning a "school function"). <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm really loving the enthusiasm, so I might make a kids <br/>
boxing Yahoo group, if I can. If you know any kids who want to post, <br/>
let me know so I know if this is really worth doing or not.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spoke at our local girl scout group about letterboxing and then hid a<br/>
couple of boxes just for them to find. To see if they would enjoy it. Those<br/>
that were interested sought me out at school. ( I work at the school they<br/>
all attend). I spoke with those parents and about half a dozen of the<br/>
families are now addicts. Two of the families have made a game out of seeing<br/>
if they can find a box that I haven't stamped into. (Which isn't hard, I've<br/>
found everything in our immediate area, but there's still LOTS in the<br/>
Portland area I haven't touched.) One family came back two weekends ago from<br/>
a trip to see family and had to come show me their log books. They had gone<br/>
boxing while they were with their family in Seattle and found boxes that my<br/>
stamp wasn't in :) <br/>

My daughter, Leopard JJ would be interested in getting involved with <br/>
Letterboxers her own age (10). While it is a "family" hobby, she <br/>
finds it extremely annoying that I am so obsessed with boxing and <br/>
she has yet to meet a fellow letterboxer her own age! We are going <br/>
to introduce it to her girl scout troop this spring, but as I have <br/>
found that meeting other boxers and corresponding with them is half <br/>
the fun, I think she would, too. Count us in!<br/>
Artdog and Leopard JJ<br/>

I have a vague memory of this already being done. I remember getting <br/>
an invitation to sign my kids up; it was an "invitation only" group. <br/>
Since this is more my thing than theirs, we didn't sign up, so I <br/>
have no idea what happened to the group. Anyone else remember this?<br/>

&gt; A little cross posting here, but I was kind of excited about this!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of the kids from my elementary schools (I travel) have really <br/>
&gt; started to get involved in letterboxing, in and out of school. It <br/>
&gt; started with my personal traveler, which I hid a few different <br/>
times <br/>
&gt; in the building and let them find during their free time. Then <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; started wanting to see our logbook and hear stories about where <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Highlander and I had been over the weekends. Now they're taking <br/>
their <br/>
&gt; own recess time to MAKE stamps and scope Atlas Quest, so I'm <br/>
looking <br/>
&gt; forward to seeing where they end up placing their boxes. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's basically only 1-5 kids at each building, but it's starting <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; look like an unofficial club (even though most of them don't even <br/>
&gt; know each other). So, I'm unofficially planning a small box hunt <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; them at the park where 19 boxes from the WNY Gathering were<br/>
&gt; (unofficially means I'll tell kids where we'll be and anyone who <br/>
&gt; shows up and stays with a parent or guardian wiil be there...that <br/>
way <br/>
&gt; I don't get in trouble for planning a "school function"). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I'm really loving the enthusiasm, so I might make a kids <br/>
&gt; boxing Yahoo group, if I can. If you know any kids who want to <br/>
post, <br/>
&gt; let me know so I know if this is really worth doing or not.<br/>

bottom feeders out is to not have a public list. Another list I'm on <br/>
requires a moderator to approve each membership before a person can <br/>
join, get or send emails, or view the pics and such. We verify each <br/>
person's info, which is even more important if you're talking about a <br/>
list of mainly minors - you'd probably make parents happier if you <br/>
checked in with them instead of just allowing kids to sign up without <br/>
permission......<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought. It's not necessary for every list, but it makes sense <br/>
in some cases.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great weekend, everyone!<br/>

I'd just like to go on record as saying that I think a kid's board<br/>
isn't the best of ideas.  Such a board would still have to have adult<br/>
members just to make sure things moderated.  I'm not sure how old<br/>
people are thinking when they say 'kids', but I know if I had kids I<br/>
probably wouldn't want them using talk lists at least until they<br/>
became a teenager.  Younger than that, I'm not sure it's a great idea.  <br/>
<br/>
However, if someone does decide to create such a talk list, there<br/>
should definitely be some ground rules about how to apply to join. <br/>
The talk list should be by invitation only.  Current members must<br/>
vouch for prospective members.  No kids should be allowed to join<br/>
without their parent's permission.  I'd even go so far as to suggest<br/>
that every post should be moderated before making it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure this is possible with Yahoo Groups, but I'd also turn off<br/>
the ability to e-mail people off-list as well.  Make sure everything<br/>
that happens on the board goes through an adult moderator first.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents!  Better safe than sorry!<br/>

&gt; Yes, there is already a private, invitation list for letterboxing <br/>
families. <br/>
&gt; If anyone would like more information, contact me privately.<br/>

Since the goal of "Family" Letterboxing is to spend some time with <br/>
your kids, I believe TurtleMcQ has the best solution of all,and that <br/>
would be to find out more information about the "invitation only" <br/>
group. While setting up a kids only group might be appealing, it is <br/>
fraught with very difficult problems and dangers.<br/>

I'll have to say that the idea of splitting the younger<br/>
folks off from the older ones saddens me. I have <br/>
always maintained that one of the best things about <br/>
letterboxing is the cross-generational appeal. It's<br/>
a way to bring together folks of all ages who seem <br/>
to enjoy the hobby as equals. In this day and age<br/>
there are far too few activities that have this kind <br/>
of appeal. <br/>
<br/>
In addition, I think younger kids would have a hard<br/>
time using the discretion necessary when using a<br/>
public talk list. Adult supervision would be a must!<br/>
I have always maintained that letterboxing is a <br/>
terrific activity to do WITH kids, just not one FOR <br/>
kids. I prefer to keep the letterboxing family <br/>
together. Funhog<br/>

Amen, I agree Funhog,<br/>
<br/>
and Funhog has been helpful in tips on a few boxes for my family,<br/>
not all letterboxes are kidfriendly at younger ages...<br/>
