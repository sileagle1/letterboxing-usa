Wesley and I had a great time, and he was thrilled that everyone ate the<br/>
hotdogs he cooked! He harrassed Wanda and Pete will a million questions on<br/>
how they gather so many letterboxes, and we even found one with them. It is<br/>
so much fun to arrive at a gathering and greet strangers as friends and see<br/>
people we only know from the messages or the one other gathering we went<br/>
to. Also it's fun to exchange "hunting" stories after the initial frenzy of<br/>
exchanges cools down. Oh, and since people seemed to enjoy the cranberry<br/>
squares (Dan C!), I'll put that receipe in our new online files someday<br/>
soon.<br/>
