                    <div class="plaintext-content">Someone mentioned hollow trees as an alternative to carefully camoflaging<br/>
boxes. The only problem here is that animals also use hollow trees as their<br/>
homes and hiding places, and are not too keen on funny plastic things<br/>
blocking up their doorways.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday I was out trailrunning with the hound in an area where I've got boxes<br/>
planted, and decided to check to see if they'd had any hits. The one box I'd<br/>
hit in a hollow at the base of a tree was sitting out on the ground smack in<br/>
the middle of the trail! Fortunately, it's an unmaintained and extremely low<br/>
usage trail (a few fourwheelers on the weekends, but almost no foot<br/>
traffic). I think one of the fourwheelers had inspected it, because the<br/>
ziplock was unzipped, but it was otherwise in fine shape, so I rehid it,<br/>
this time under a log rather than in the hollow of the tree (note to<br/>
self--fix clues on website!)<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of the time we are quick to jump on "vandals" for causing<br/>
boxes to go missing but fail to recognize just how curious and/or annoyed<br/>
the furry woodlanders can be. I say this also as someone who has watched<br/>
entire cardboard boxes on her balcony disappear from around their contents<br/>
over the course of the winter, as the persistent little squirrels chewed<br/>
them up and dragged them off to their nests. I'd be curious if any of the<br/>
burlapers have seen evidence that squirrels chew on it? I ask, because one<br/>
of the other things they ate over the winter was several macrame plant<br/>
hangers. Not just nibbled or chewed, but shredded into a heap of tiny<br/>
fibers.<br/>
