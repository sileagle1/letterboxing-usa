Today was my first time out  on the trail since I found out I had Lyme disease, didn't want to over do so decided to hike one of my favorite trails close to home and check on boxes I know are up there. Not all of them are mine and I know some of the planters live far away or don't box anymore so I like to keep an eye on them.<br/>
Last time I was up there I checked on a mystery box planted by a well known boxer and thought I was mistaken about the rock it was under, it seemed to have moved. Then a few weeks ago another boxer had mentioned they had searched and thought the box was missing. Reviewed clues before I left to make sure I had the right rock. What I found was rock had been moved about 2 feet, it's a big rock so not sure how this happened. Looked under edges for box and was about to give up but poked around in the leaf litter and lo and behold the box! <br/>
Replaced box under edge of rock. I neglected to look in box to make sure contents were still there, next time. It's an easy mystery and I wish more people would give it a go. Clues are not on AQ or LBNA but are easy enough to find.<br/>
 I should post this on LBMA sinnce it is a local PA box, but just don't have the energy.<br/>

We planted CJ's Funbus in April 2008 for our son Chris. Several folks found the box but the host (VW Surfer's Van) went missing a few months ago. I deleted clues and didn't have another thought about it until we received a "found" report from a local boxer.<br/>
<br/>
They had found the box on July 19, 2009 and we found this quite confusing.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the location and found the VW Van back at its home spot with a spiffy new paint job. Checked the hiding spot of the magnetic box and in checking the logbook found that the body shop had signed the logbook on June 2nd.<br/>
<br/>
The logbook was full so we added a new one but left the old one as well.<br/>
<br/>
The new clue sheet is titled   "CJ's Funbus....RETURNS!"<br/>

Last time I was up that way we found the "companion" to that box, which I know many of us thought had disappeared also.... of course going back with actual clues in hand--rather than trying to remember what you did two years &amp; three seasons ago--is always a help =)<br/>

Our sincere hopes for a full recovery.  Hope it was caught early enough for simple antibiotic treatment to be effective.  If you earlier mentioned having this, I missed it.  The fact that you are able to get out and hike, at least a little, does bode well :-)<br/>
