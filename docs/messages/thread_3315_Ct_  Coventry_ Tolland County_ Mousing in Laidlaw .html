<div>Dedicated to the boys in Den 4 pack 65 of 
Coventry. Have Fun</div>

<div>Take Rte 44  from the junction of 31 head 
east. Turn  left on  North River Road. At the Y bear left on  
Goose Lane  to stop. Turn right pass a farm, the brick school then park is 
on your right.  Enter the park and pass the fire house. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To find this letterbox drive in the drive slowly 
at the point when you can see the fields come in to view note a trail out the 
right side, the grass all mown. ( 240 degrees )   This is before the 
driveway splits in three.  park the car and go back to the trail head. 
There are tree pieces and stonewall there too.  I saw a small bunny and 
other woodland creatures so no doubt this is the place to start mousing.Enter 
the path and take a right on a bike trail at the next intersection take a left 
see the stonewall on your left and a house in the distance to your right.  
Walk until  you come to the corner of the wall at  120 degrees take 21 
paces ( count left foot)  along the wall to your box. Stamp in secretly and 
rehide exactley as it was ,so others may enjoy the  search.  When you 
are done Mousing you can either go back the way you came or  hop over the 
wall and return to the trail there. </div>
<div>Good Luck</div></body></html>
