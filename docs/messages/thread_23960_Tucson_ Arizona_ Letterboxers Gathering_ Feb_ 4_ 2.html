place on February 4, 2007, 8:00 AM to 1:30 PM. All letterboxers are <br/>
invited. The event will be held at Ramada 4 in Christopher Columbus <br/>
Park, 4600 N. Silverbell Rd., Tucson, Arizona. Columbus Park is off I-<br/>
10 at Ruthrauff/El Camino Del Cerro exit and west of the Santa Cruz <br/>
River. New letterboxes will be placed for this event. Also, bring your <br/>
own new boxes to place. There is lots of open space with trees and <br/>
shrubs right up to the river area. Breakfast will be provided. <br/>
However, bring your own hot drinks. This is a great opportunity to <br/>
meet new letterboxers, do some exchanges, and obtain a few travelers. <br/>
There are dozens of letterboxes in the Tucson area to find before and <br/>
after the event.  This event is being held at the same time as the <br/>
Tucson Gem &amp; Mineral Show -- the world's largest gem &amp; mineral show!  <br/>
Please be aware that motel rooms, as well as rental cars, are very <br/>
difficult to find and expensive.  If you are having a problem locating <br/>
a room, you might try to the east in Benson or north to Casa Grande or <br/>
even Phoenix.  More information about this event may be found at:  <br/>
