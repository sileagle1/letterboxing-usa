letterbox variations!  Each box is unique (as is each boxer) and I <br/>
often wonder about the letterbox differences that aren't discussed on <br/>

&gt; the clues here and on their own web sites.  If it weren't for your <br/>
&gt; talent and enthusiasm, our trip would have been much less <br/>
&gt; interesting, physically challenging, and emotionally rewarding.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We planted our first letterbox shortly before we left a month ago.  <br/>
&gt; We now are planning many more to share with you.  Most of our <br/>
&gt; efforts will be here in California.  But we have several more cross-<br/>
&gt; country sojourns planned, so we hope to spread a bit more boxing <br/>
fun <br/>
&gt; to other states as well in the next year or two.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To celebrate our 100th find Grumpy drew and carved our new image-<br/>
&gt; based signature stamp.  It will replace the unimaginative initial-<br/>
&gt; based stamp a number of you will find in your logbooks.  We'll try <br/>
&gt; to share it with many of you as we search, stamp, and travel our <br/>
&gt; beautiful country.  Thanks again to all of you who enrich this <br/>
&gt; leisure activity for us all.<br/>
