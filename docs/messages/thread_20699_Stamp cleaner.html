Hey all ...<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about picking up some stamp cleaner.  After going<br/>
to the MMM we got a bit tired of stamping everything in black -- the<br/>
overwelhming color choice for MMM boxes.  We tried to stamp a few<br/>
boxes in other colors using our own ink pads, but the black ink<br/>
residue on the stamp darkened the other colors when stamped and left a<br/>
solid residue of black on the ink pads.<br/>
<br/>
Stamp cleaner to the rescue, perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
We were thinking something like this:<br/>
http://www.wilde-ideas.com/Vndrs/Tsu/StampClnr.html<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone out there carry stamp cleaner to clean box stamps?  What<br/>
is your experience with it?<br/>

I do this same thing. Stamp cleaners have been a large discussion at <br/>
times on the list.  Please keep in mind that they are heavily <br/>
perfumed and may have tendency to attract things.  I prefer a wet <br/>
paper towell in a baggie (holds moisture well, and baby wipes are <br/>
also highly perfumed) along with a dry paper towell to blot with.<br/>

I took it to heart when people said fragrances would attract critters and wouldn't want to be responsible for the demise of someone's box at the hands (paws?) of a critter.  I took an old, ragged towel and cut it into approximately 3" squares.  I keep a few damp ones (just water) in one zip-lock and dry ones in another.  When they get really gross, I throw them away.  One ragged bath towel will yield lots of little squares and they work well.<br/>

As many people use pigment inks will a wet paper towel actually remove<br/>
the ink?  Surely it will work on dye ink, but I didn't think water<br/>
alone would work on pigment.<br/>
<br/>
Being aware of fragrence is a good idea.  Thanks for the heads up.<br/>

the<br/>
&gt; overwelhming color choice for MMM boxes. We tried to stamp a few<br/>
&gt; boxes in other colors using our own ink pads, but the black ink<br/>
&gt; residue on the stamp darkened the other colors when stamped and <br/>
left a<br/>
&gt; solid residue of black on the ink pads.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Stamp cleaner to the rescue, perhaps?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We were thinking something like this:<br/>
&gt; http://www.wilde-ideas.com/Vndrs/Tsu/StampClnr.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anyone out there carry stamp cleaner to clean box stamps? <br/>
What<br/>
&gt; is your experience with it?<br/>

&gt; As many people use pigment inks will a wet paper towel actually <br/>
remove<br/>
&gt; the ink?  Surely it will work on dye ink, but I didn't think water<br/>
&gt; alone would work on pigment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Being aware of fragrence is a good idea.  Thanks for the heads up.<br/>

If you use it while it is still wet, it works great, obviously it is <br/>
a little harder when it dries, but pigment dries slower, so it isn't <br/>
a huge problem.<br/>
