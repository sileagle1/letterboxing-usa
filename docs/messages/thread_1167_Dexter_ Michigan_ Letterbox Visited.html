or it disappeared... (if for some reason this IS a duplicate, I <br/>
apologize!)<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my family and I went on our first REAL Letterboxing <br/>
adventure (last week I found the virtual Letterbook hidden by Tom <br/>
Cooch). We found the box in Dexter, Michigan, hidden by Marty <br/>
Chamberlain and had a terrific time doing so. All three of us took an <br/>
active part -- our son, Teddy, located the first clue, my husband <br/>
read the compass (I am new to compass reading), and I actually <br/>
located the box -- intact, with about five previous visitors. We <br/>
added our stamp and had a great time in the park itself.<br/>
<br/>
We have determined a location for our first box, have the stamp <br/>
carved, but still need to prepare the box and write clues (which we <br/>
will post, of course).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the fun!<br/>
