&gt;  Recently, someone on the TX Yahoo Group wanted to hear about "the good old days" of letterboxing, so I began writing some of my memories, mostly of letterboxing in Texas.  However, I did write one about the fun times we used to have on this Group and I thought I would share it with y'all.  Even though I remembered most of the stories, I took the time to look up pertinent posts and added hyperlinks so you can read them yourself.

              &gt; Recently, someone on the TX Yahoo Group wanted to
              hear about "the good old days" of letterboxing, so I began
              writing some of my memories, mostly of letterboxing in
              Texas. However, I did write one about the fun times we
              used to have on this Group and I thought I would share it
              with y'all. Even though I remembered most of the stories,
              I took the time to look up pertinent posts and added
              hyperlinks so you can read them yourself. I highly
              recommend going back to the dates of these posts and
              reading all of the replies since many were just as funny.
              I created a folder in the Files section called
              Letterboxing Memories and uploaded my Fun on the Forum
              story:<br/>

              &gt; <br/>
              &gt; Feel free to add any of your memories to the folder
              or just post them here. I'm not sure anyone is still out
              there so this might be falling on deaf ears, but I would
              love to hear from others, especially the ones mentioned in
              my memories.<br/>
