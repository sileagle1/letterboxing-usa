                    <html><body><div><div>Hi all ,below is a new letterbox called Tiger Cub. Tonight I meet with the Tiger Cub Pack that routinly holds its meetings at mansfield middle school to teach all the boys about letterboxing. This important event had to be honored with a box they could seek as well as revisit and see who came to call on them. Tiger Cubs are  a young version of Boy Scounts ,younger than cub scouts they are 7. We should have fun tonight. Look for them on the trails this spring! Leader of the Pack</div>

Hey!  I'm a tiger cub leader too!  But we are in Washington state.  <br/>
I've thought of taking my tigers on a hunt but haven't done it.  <br/>
We've gone on a few trails where letterboxes were and I did <br/>
show them one.  WE always have lots of siblings along.  It <br/>
makes for very adventurous trips because they are younger than <br/>
the tigers!<br/>
<br/>
Our pack was gifted a special letterbox by this year's webelo's <br/>
den that bridged up to boy scouts.  It was created by Alafair and <br/>
brought here by Patricius Delevariensis.  It's quite a special <br/>
stamp and we'd be willing to work out trying to send a print or <br/>
something or coordinate something between packs/dens.  <br/>
<br/>
Contact us offline at 7nails at truthmail dot com  just sub the @ <br/>
for at and the . for dot if you want to coordinate something.<br/>

A Huge Thank You for meeting with the Tiger Scouts last night.Everyone <br/>
seemed to enjoy the quest. I think that they are hooked on <br/>
Letterboxing now! IT was a nice surprise to everyone last night that <br/>
you planted a box in their honor. We will check on it every time we <br/>
meet to see how many visitors we have had. You sure insipired us all. <br/>
Keep up the GREAT work. See you on the trials.<br/>
