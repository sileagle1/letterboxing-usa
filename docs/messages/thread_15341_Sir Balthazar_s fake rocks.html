Thanks for asking. I use Amaco "Sculptamold" at about two parts to <br/>
one of water. I am now mixing in tan, black, and silver paint with <br/>
the wet material before I mold it (then add more Sculptamold if the <br/>
mixture is too wet.) That way if the "rock" gets beaten up, it will <br/>
still be naturally colored throughout. Nothing says trash like a <br/>
glaring white hunk of something. <br/>
<br/>
I mold this around tupper-like containers or film cannisters with the <br/>
lid side down. I then make sure the lid still will seat around the <br/>
sealing surface. If it does not, the set material is pretty easily <br/>
pared away with a knife.<br/>
<br/>
I spray each rock with matte finish plastic sealer, top and bottom. I <br/>
try to get at least two coats on. We do not have that much rain most <br/>
of the year but we have not been thru a rainy season since I started <br/>
doing this. Will let you know in December how the rocks holdup.<br/>
<br/>
They are fairly lightweight. You could put large iron washers in for <br/>
extra weight if you thought that a problem. I try to place these in <br/>
fairly sheltered locations. Obviously the one for the Stone Soup is <br/>
very exposed. May have to move it.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing, some of my fake rocks have been out in plain sight for a <br/>
couple months and they have not been molested. People see what they <br/>
expect to see, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
My other fake rocks are real rocks that I have hollowed out by drill. <br/>
<br/>
I intend to bring both sorts up to the Sept 6th Bay Area Gathering <br/>
and will have both sorts at the Oct 4th SLO Stamping in the Meadow <br/>
event.<br/>
<br/>
I am sure you can find some other materials to play with. I have done <br/>
oven hardening clay with some success but it is a tad pricey.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps and was what you wanted to know.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely (anti-cheese-racingly) your servant,<br/>

Thank you for the detailed instructions and I had just one question. What<br/>
type of paint are you using - oil, watercolors, acrylics?<br/>
