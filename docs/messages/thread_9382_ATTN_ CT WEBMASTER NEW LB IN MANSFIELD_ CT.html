RATE: EASY  - ABOUT 30 HOUR <br/>
PLANTED: 11/26/02    BY B-THE WEEKEND WARRIOR<br/>
    MANSFIELD CT, IN TOLLAND COUNTY<br/>
<br/>
TAKE ROUTE 32 IN MANSFIELD TO MERROW RD. GO OVER THE RAILROAD TRACKS <br/>
TO THE PARKING LOT FOR MERROW MEADOW PARK ON THE LEFT AND PARK.  <br/>
THIS IS A POPULAR AREA - TRY TO KEEP THE BOXES A SECRET.<br/>
    THREE WIZARDS DECIDED GO TO THE FORBIDDEN WOODS TO FIND THE <br/>
INGREDIENTS FOR A NEW POTION.  THEY NEEDED: EYE OF NEWT; OOSBAIN; <br/>
AND GREDDER BERRIES.  THEY DECIDED TO TAKE THE PATH TO THE LEFT AND <br/>
STAYED ON THE TRAIL UNTIL THE SAW A PATH OFF TO THE LEFT - THEY <br/>
FOLLOWED OVER A BRIDGE UNTIL THEY CAME ACROSS DOUBLE BROOMSTICKS ON <br/>
A WOODEN POST. DIRECTLY BEHIND THIS POST, BY THE TREE WITH TWO <br/>
TRUCKS (THE RIGHT ARM DEAD) THE FIRST WIZARD CAN BE FOUND PICKING <br/>
OOSBAIN BEHIND THIS TREE.<br/>
      THEY PROCEDED BACK TO THE PATH AND CONTINUED ONWARD TO THE <br/>
LEFT.  THEY NOTED A STEEP PATH UP TO THE LEFT, LEADING TO THE <br/>
HOGWART EXPRESS, HOPING TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE STEAMER THEY TOOK <br/>
THIS PATH.  AFTER WAITING A WHILE AND NO TRAIN IN SIGHT, THEY GOT <br/>
BORED AND STARTED SNOOPING AROUND.  THEY WENT OFF THE PATH (ABOUT <br/>
TWENTY FEET BEFORE THE TRACKS GOING UP THE HILL ON YOUR RIGHT) <br/>
TOWARD THE SOUND OF RUSHING WATER. THEY WALKED OVER TO THE WATERFALL <br/>
AND LISTENED.  THEY CONTINUED DOWN BESIDE THE BROOK OVER THE <br/>
CRUMPLING STONE WALL (CAREFUL THIS IS AN ANKLE BREAKER / STAY AWAY <br/>
FROM THE EDGE (CHUCK THIS MEANS YOU!)) FOR ABOUT SIX PACES FROM THE <br/>
AREA OF THE LARGE SMOOTHED BARK TREE, AND FOUND THEMSELVES STANDING <br/>
ON A FLAT ROCK BETWEEN TWO OAKS (LOOKS LIKE A HAND POINTING).  ON <br/>
THE DOWNHILL SIDE OF THE OAK TO THE RIGHT. THE SECOND WIZARD FOUND <br/>
HER INGREDIENT. HERE YOU WILL FIND WIZARD NUMBER TWO.<br/>
     HAVING FOUND TWO OF THE THREE INGREDIENTS THEY CONTINUED DOWN <br/>
THE HILL TOWARDS THE RIVER. AT THE BOTTOM THEY FOUND THE WHITE DOT <br/>
TRAIL.  AT THIS POINT THEY NEEDED TO DECIDE WHICH WAY TO GO - GOING <br/>
TO THE LEFT AND FINDING SOMEONE ELSE'S BOX (MERROW PARK) OR GOING <br/>
RIGHT TOWARD WHERE THE EYE OF NEWT COULD BE FOUND.  IF YOU DECIDED, <br/>
LIKE THE WIZARDS, TO GO RIGHT FOLLOW THE PATH TO YOUR THIRD BOX.  AT <br/>
THE DOUBLE WHITE DOTTED TREE, BEAR LEFT OVER THE CORNER BRIDGE AND <br/>
FOLLOW THE PATH ALONG THE RIVER.  CONTINUE ACROSS THREE MORE <br/>
BRIDGES, FOLLOWING THE COUNT DOWN OF NUMBERS BACK TO THE PAVED PATH -<br/>
STAY LEFT. GO TO POST #3, STAND WITH YOUR LEFT SHOULDER TO THE POST <br/>
AND TAKE A READING OF 160 DEGREES.  ACROSS THE PATH FOR ABOUT SEVEN <br/>
PACES TO A TALL STRAIGHT TREE -BEHIND THAT TREE THE THIRD WIZARD <br/>
FOUND HIS EYE OF NEWT AND STASHED SOME FOR LATER IN A MAN MADE BOX <br/>
OF STONE.  YOU'LL DISCOVER THE THIRD WIZARD THERE.  STAMP PRIVATELY <br/>
AND RETURN HIM TO THIS NEWT PATCH.  GO BACK TO THE PATH, BEAR RIGHT, <br/>
AND YOUR CAR SHOULD BE QUICKLY IN SIGHT.  <br/>

Wow, if 30 hours is easy I would hate to do one of your difficult <br/>
ones!  ;o)<br/>
