                    <div class="plaintext-content">Um, before everyone starts marking thier calendars, note that a date <br/>
has NOT been set for the Midwest Gathering.  Instead, please vote at <br/>
the new LbGLK group's website ( <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LbGLK/ )on your choices for the date <br/>
of the gathering (for those interested in attending).  I would <br/>
actually prefer to do it in early June after school is out for the <br/>
summer, rather than the busy end of May with exams, graduation, and <br/>
state track meets.... but I'm game for any of the weekends on the <br/>
poll.  Afterall, "Letterboxing is Life!"<br/>
<br/>
I would say, however, that one way or another it SHOULD be a go for <br/>
some time around end of May/early June at a NE Illinois State Park.  <br/>
I hope to have a few scouted out in the next few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned for more info...<br/>
