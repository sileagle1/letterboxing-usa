Hello...My name is Angel. I live in GA. I stumbled on the box Paul <br/>
Bunyon II. I have the conratulations ticket and tried to look for it <br/>
on the website but it is not listed. It was places by Cherokee Rose <br/>
on 12/31/2004. I think this is just the neatest thing! I never <br/>
nknew!!<br/>

Wow! Your first find is the box's first find! Very cool. Welcome to<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone enters their letterboxes in letterboxing.org. Some people<br/>
use Atlas Quest (www.atlasquest.com) and others don't list them at all.<br/>

 This is too cool. You are the ff on my first box in Tennessee and <br/>
my daughter's name is Angel also! And this is your first found <br/>
letterbox. I guess it was just ment to be.... Don't forget to log in <br/>

Actually, I think it's pretty amazing she found this box w/o having <br/>
the clues? Would love to hear the story behind the story Angel?<br/>
