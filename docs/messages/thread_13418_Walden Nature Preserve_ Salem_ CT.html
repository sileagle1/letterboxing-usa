letterboxers at Steve's mini-event at the Montville Relay for Life. <br/>
unfortunately, I arrived much too late.<br/>
  I proceded to the Preserve so that something productive and <br/>
positive would still come of the day!  This is a lovely spot.  I plan <br/>
to return with my husband in a couple weeks to seek out Butterfly's <br/>
newly planted series. <br/>
  Today was certainly a rainy day.....so what else is new lately here <br/>
in Ct.??  My mission:  to stay comfortable, to find boxes, to keep <br/>
the afore-mentioned boxes dry and to add stamps to my nice dry <br/>
journal.  Mission accomplished, except I ended up with soppy hair and <br/>
soggy jeans from the knees down.  That's o.k., feet were dry and it <br/>
was a wonderful peaceful afternoon.<br/>
  I found the Tree Stump Box ("Bee Happy"), but was not able to <br/>
find "Go Batty" tag-along.  The birches were where they were supposed <br/>
to be, but no stump.  Perhaps this is because it has grown up so <br/>
much. I did find the second tag-along entitled "Big Rock" and also a <br/>
surprise.  Thanks Steve, Heidi and Madras.<br/>
  So, how did I keep all the important letterbox and journal stuff <br/>
dry?  My raincoat was laid down on the ground, dry side up with an <br/>
umbrella propped open.  I knelt, butt in the air and nose to the <br/>
ground, stamping and reading each logbook.  If anyone had seen me, <br/>
they would have had no clue what the heck I was up too.  They would <br/>
never have asked either! ;-)<br/>
  A late afternoon cheeseburger with fries at Harry's place, then <br/>
home sweet home.<br/>
