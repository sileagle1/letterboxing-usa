asking general questions as to what she should include in her box?  <br/>
Do people in different areas include different items?<br/>
<br/>
I would think that including a state in the subject of a general <br/>
question may limit the number of people who would read the post and <br/>
potentially be able to provide answers, as they would surmise the <br/>
message was specific to the poster's state and skip over it.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents...<br/>

always report finds here), you could include your email address or <br/>
stamped postcards. But either is totally optional.<br/>
I include my email address and occasionally get a note when a box is <br/>
found -- love that!<br/>
<br/>
As for labeling the box - sometimes I remember to put "this is not <br/>
trash" in permanent marker on it --- sometimes I forget!<br/>
