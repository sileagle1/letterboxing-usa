                    <div class="plaintext-content">HI, when we are in add boxes we can not get the Counties in because the<br/>
box won't open.We put the name of the letterbox,then click on the state<br/>
and then when we click on Counties the box disappears it won't open.Last<br/>
night we put most of our boxes on by filling out the information and<br/>
skipping over Counties and putting town and date and then<br/>
submitting.Then we would have to go into our boxes and click on edit and<br/>
then type in the Countie and hit resubmit and that worked.But today we<br/>
are trying to put the rest of our boxes on,and now it won't let us do it<br/>
that way.It says that it can not enter clues because there is no Countie<br/>
but it won't let me click on to it .it doesn't work.If we can get the<br/>
Countie box to work we will be all set.Thank you Lenny/Kathy The<br/>
