Found CSULB 49er Mascot box, great hide by Don &amp; Gwen, Box is in <br/>
great shape. Moved on to "Catching Some Sun in the Quad" I think I <br/>
had compass dyslexia, I was all turned around and was running out of <br/>
time and gave up. Ran over to the Real 49er, great spot and an <br/>
awesome stamp!<br/>
Went back to Whittier to scout out our next series "Strange Stamps"<br/>
Will post clues soon.<br/>
Happy Trails to all Mothers, hope you had a great day,<br/>
Jam (Jelly's with her Mom)<br/>
