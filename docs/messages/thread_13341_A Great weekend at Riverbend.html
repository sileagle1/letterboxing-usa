We want to thank all involved in the great gathering at Riverbend.  <br/>
Although it was supposedly downgraded to *just a picnic* because of <br/>
the weather conditions, it was indeed a gathering.  Three beautifully <br/>
carved and wonderfully different Event stamps by Mary from Virginia, <br/>
Firefly and Sam-I-am.  Several boxes planted just for the event  <br/>
thanks, Mary and Rich. We may not be great linguists, but we know a <br/>
wierd looking tree when we see one!  We came away with 38 exchanges <br/>
and several personal travelers!  It was really nice to see so many <br/>
youngsters involved in `boxing and having their own signature <br/>
stamps.  And, hey! These mid-Atlantic folks do stamps in Technicolor!<br/>
<br/>
The weather forecast was for severe thunderstorms, but after an <br/>
early, brief shower, the weather improved for the next 4 hours, while <br/>
everyone stamped, migrated, ate (lots and lots of good food), and <br/>
stamped some more.  We then had the pleasure of searching for <br/>
Riverbend boxes with Wanda (solo), Psychomommy and Princess Turtle, <br/>
and Scarab and Night Owl.  Oh, my, such mud!!  But the pleasant <br/>
company and good stamps made it quite worthwhile.  We are still <br/>
amazed at Psychomommy doing all that hiking up and down hills through <br/>
the mud in flip-flops!!<br/>
<br/>
A very big *thank you* to the Doubtful Guests for their hospitality.  <br/>
Scarab, we never would have found some of those parks without your <br/>
guidance, and BTW, you make one heck of a Sunday breakfast!! <br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed meeting all of the people who were previously only names <br/>
on the talk list. We can now see your faces and hear your voices as <br/>
we read the posts. Please give us a holler if you make your way north <br/>
to Connecticut.<br/>
<br/>
Happy and safe boxing to all,<br/>
