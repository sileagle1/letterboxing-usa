Well we came across this little hitchhiker when we found Red Squirrel <br/>
yesterday afternoon. Our whole family (and some extended family) were <br/>
out hunting in Wapato Park (Tacoma, WA) and were treated to our first <br/>
hitchhiker. I'm claiming it since I was the one to open the box!! <br/>
WooHoo!! My daughter and I have a plan for dropping off this coming <br/>
weekend. We have a specific box we will be looking for to place it <br/>
in. Not sure how often the box is visited since it is off the beaten <br/>
path. <br/>
<br/>
This was our second weekend of letterboxing and we were tickled pink <br/>
to find a hitchhiker. Especially not knowing what one was until we <br/>
found it! Nor knowing that one was placed earlier that morning!<br/>
<br/>
Til later,<br/>

We've been unloading things from our backpack for a couple weeks, it <br/>
