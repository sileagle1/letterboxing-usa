<br/>
There seems to be some frustration and anxiety about our progress.  Many have<br/>
made pointed comments to the effect: "Start boxing and stop talking!"  OK, I<br/>
hear that.  This is definitely a bit of talk here so if you don't have time<br/>
don't read it, but its time I think to put some things in perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Who's to blame?:<br/>
<br/>
I'll take some of the blame for our apparent inability to keep up.  I presented<br/>
a mapping model last spring that requires the whole country to be full of<br/>
letterboxes in order to be filled out.  But I'm sure in the best of<br/>
circumstances it will be many years before this can be realized.  I had no idea<br/>
how ambitious this would (appear to) be.  Its like "Letterboxing or Bust."  I<br/>
mean we could have 10,000 letterboxes out there<br/>
and it still would not be enough.  All of Dartmoor is about the size of Rhode<br/>
Island to give you some perspective.  Dartmoor has about 32,000 letterboxes as I<br/>
understand.  I think its going to be a while before we saturate the U.S.<br/>
with letterboxes enough for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
[But Rachel, I'm pulling for you and I promise to find your box next time I'm in<br/>
Chicago.  Be patient...]<br/>
<br/>
Reasonable goals:<br/>
<br/>
It'll be nice to have a few letterboxes within a reasonable drive from most<br/>
populated areas -- or the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska if you wish.<br/>
<br/>
Your efforts:<br/>
<br/>
I'll be happy if the efforts continue as they are.  I think it has been laudable<br/>
that so many of you have taken an interest and contributed your time and<br/>
efforts.  If anyone goes to Tennessee they will find a very invloved and complex<br/>
(orienteering) type of hunt.  Becky's clues take you on a lengthy adventure. <br/>
Then again, my box at Split Rock Lighthouse in Minnesota can be found in two<br/>
minutes by a 10 year old.  It takes all kinds you know?  The Rock Creek box<br/>
(Thom) has somewhat cryptic and cleverly worded clues.  This kind of box doesn't<br/>
take long to find but it makes you think. <br/>
<br/>
For others in the future:<br/>
<br/>
We have a medium that will require cooperation and willingness of involvement of<br/>
countless individuals if the hobby expects to keep growing.  Most of them will<br/>
know next to nothing about letterboxing at the outset.  Some may have never sent<br/>
an e-mail message or picked up a carving tool before seeing our site.  We will<br/>
minimally have to educate people how to make a letterbox and how to send their<br/>
clues and images in to those of us who post them to the page.  But this will<br/>
only be to those who want their own letterbox, not to those who are just<br/>
searching.<br/>
<br/>
What is it we are striving for?:<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it there are two separate, but necessary sentiments among our<br/>
members.  One is the yearning to see the hobby grow both in number of people<br/>
involved and in number of letterboxes available to find.  The other sentiment is<br/>
that we present information to people in a way that makes it easy for them to<br/>
learn about letterboxing and to become involved, thereby helping to fulfill the<br/>
first sentiment.  The recent effort for Kids I think is also a reflection of<br/>
these sentiments -- it just more readily admits that it is fun we are after, not<br/>
"manifest destiny."  I mean this is just a hobby, you know? (See the attached<br/>
cartoon)<br/>
<br/>
The way I see it we should not pressure those who have joined us who just want<br/>
to watch our progress and perhaps wait for a letterbox to appear on the map<br/>
within a reasonable distance from their home.  I'm happy to have them on board. <br/>
I do think most people will want to have their own box sometime, and the<br/>
resources we are providing on our page will prove invaluable to them.  But some<br/>
will just wait and when boxes appear they will go out to find them.  That's OK<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
2 more Minnesota letterboxes almost ready!:<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I had 2 more boxes ready to go out, but they will be in a flood<br/>
plane so not only do I have to anchor them so they don't float away, I will also<br/>
have to make sure they're hermetically sealed so they don't become ruined from<br/>
moisture. I think the long tall jars are finally going to come in handy. They<br/>
seal up tight as a drum. (Look to http://www.pclink.com/elf/resource.htm for<br/>
info on the Long Tall Jar) The only thing is you can't have a stamp larger than<br/>
2 3/8" because that's the inside diameter of the jar.  Luckily both of my stamps<br/>
are smaller than that.  The jar will be sealed and tied with fish line to a nice<br/>
tree or post.  I know this may violate the Dartmoor rules because it may involve<br/>
an unnatural object (a lamp post perhaps), but so be it.  Sometimes you have to<br/>
be resourceful.<br/>
<br/>
But I just want to say again that some people will only be seekers of<br/>
letterboxes.  And that's OK.<br/>
<br/>
Take care all,<br/>
Dan'l<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You're right, Dan.  It's like I've always said...<br/>
There are three kinds of people in this world:<br/>
1) Letterbox Hunters<br/>
2) Letterbox Hiders<br/>
3) Really boring people who don't count, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Both of the first two types are pretty cool, in my opinion!!  :o)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, I hope no one misunderstood my earlier posting to be<br/>
intended to pressure newbies into thinking they have to make a letterbox in<br/>
order to belong to our cozy little group.  There's nothing wrong with being<br/>
interested in the hobby strictly from the perspective of a letterbox finder.<br/>
It's just that I know for a fact that several of us (myself included) have<br/>
great ideas for letterboxes and have been procrastinating.  I'm not trying to<br/>
pressure anyone, just playfully tease some of us into action.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Dan, wherever did you get that amazingly accurate cartoon likeness<br/>
of me?  I love it!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Having fun Rules!!<br/>
