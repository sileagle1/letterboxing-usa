<br/>
Im suprised in finding out just "how prepared" people<br/>
are for the letterbox hikes they take! Most items on<br/>
peoples list probably serve them well, so please<br/>
nobody take me wrong on this posting, you use what you<br/>
want to use. When I started backpacking, lo those many<br/>
years ago, the catch phrase of the organization was<br/>
"BE PREPARED," that was drilled into my head over and<br/>
over, so on my first trip I brought everything on the<br/>
list... I mean everything! But through the process of<br/>
trial and error, I soon learned how to cut things from<br/>
the list, saving space, and more importantly saving<br/>
weight.<br/>
   Just like different seasons require dofferent items<br/>
I believe different hikes require different equipment.<br/>
When I find myself gettine bit by the letterboxing bug<br/>
I grab my "MOUNTAINSMITH ENGINEERING" TOUR fanny<br/>
pack... available from your local EMS or other<br/>
sporting goods store, in that pack usually is....<br/>
<br/>
1.Personal Logbook<br/>
2.Personal Stamp<br/>
3.Ink Pad<br/>
4.Pen(s) Blue and Black<br/>
5. Compass, with a reflective back.... why carry a<br/>
mirror when your compass can do two things for you?<br/>
6.Letterbox repair kit...rubbermaid container, ink<br/>
pad, et al.<br/>
7.Headlamp... keeps my hands free when it gets dark. I<br/>
used to do ALOT of night hiking...<br/>
8. SMALL, I mean, SMALL first aid kit. I'm not going<br/>
to perform surgery out there am I?<br/>
9. Water Bottles.<br/>
10. Bug Repellant.<br/>
<br/>
Now out of those 10 items the things I usually carry<br/>
would be 1-4. I just take them out of my bag take the<br/>
satmp and stick it in a little niche in my ink pad and<br/>
then rubber band them to my logbook. Now I have a<br/>
small package to fit into my pants! On the clues that<br/>
contain 0-3or 4 compass bearings I wont take my<br/>
compass, I can discern the direction using the sun.<br/>
Last time I checked, moss may not grow on the north<br/>
side of trees but the sun still moves east to west.<br/>
Any more than 4 bearings and I will take my compass.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is, I just don't like to carry a lot<br/>
of extraneous wieght around, besides the 60 pounds of<br/>
my own extra flesh, why carry more? I'm going out to<br/>
get a letterbox, but more importantly I am going out<br/>
to enjoy the scenery which prompted some one to put<br/>
that box there! I have seen many things which I never<br/>
knew existed, even in places I had been to before!<br/>
<br/>
But in any case, I hope all your ventures are Boxious!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Yep....my son choose his new compass based on that very idea.  :o)<br/>

&gt; using the sun.  Last time I checked, moss may not <br/>
&gt; grow on the north side of trees but the sun still <br/>
&gt; moves east to west.<br/>
<br/>
One of my clues has a bearing of 5.5 degrees.  I would<br/>
recommend bringing a compass for that one, even if you<br/>
think you can hit it with unaided navigation.  I've<br/>
seen other clues where precise compass work is useful,<br/>
although I'll admit most of the time I just run into <br/>
the area and look for the obvious feature with unaided<br/>
navigation.<br/>
<br/>
As for the question asking for a compass recommendation,<br/>
Brunton, Silva, and Suunto are all good brands.  Do not<br/>
cheap out on a compass, would be my recommendation --<br/>
you don't want a bubble after 6 months, expecially if<br/>
you plan to use it at high altitudes, where even good<br/>
compasses can develop bubbles.<br/>
<br/>
I would also recommend a baseplate-style compass for<br/>
letterboxing, as it is the easiest, I think, for newbies<br/>
to learn to use for letterboxing clues.<br/>
<br/>
There is a how to use a compass url on my faq, and here <br/>
is a good on-line store that sells and has more information <br/>
about compasses than anyone would ever prolly need:<br/>
http://www.thecompassstore.com/<br/>
<br/>
Good luck :-)<br/>

Mapsurfer boxes are THE REASON god invented<br/>
compasses.. most clues do not even come close to the<br/>
complexity empolyed by you.... it's a compliment... I<br/>
would never attempt one of your boxes without<br/>
thoroughly researching it and carrying a GOOD compass.<br/>
