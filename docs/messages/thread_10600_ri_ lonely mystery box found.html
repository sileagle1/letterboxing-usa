Some people are better at solving mysteries than others.  I am not <br/>
very good at mystery boxes.  When I make several ( or many) attempts <br/>
without sucess I put the clues away for a while. Otherwise I just <br/>
spin my wheels.  This has happened to me with Dingos &amp; with Lone Mass <br/>
Wolf's mystery.  I will pick them up again some day &amp; work on them <br/>
some more but there is only so much energy you can put into it <br/>
without results before you must move on.<br/>
<br/>
It is funny... I tried to do Dingos thinking it would be fairly <br/>
easy.  I went to where I thought it would be... but boy did I get <br/>
lost.  None of the street names matched any of the street names on my <br/>
map.  I was confused just on finding my way back home never mind <br/>
finding the box LOL.  It takes a lot to get lost in RI but some how I <br/>
managed to!<br/>
