                    <div class="plaintext-content">Many thanks to Sealights, Amymisha and Phynstar for their work in pulling together the Maine Event yesterday.  It was a wonderful group of friendly people.  It was great to renew acquaintances with those I had met at Moose Hill last winter and to put faces with names I have seen on the list but had not met yet.  The boxes hidden were creative and fun.  The weather cooperated and I do believe a good time was had by all.  To paraphrase a song from "Carousel" -   "This was a real nice gathering.  I'm mighty glad I came.  The vittles I et were good, you bet.  The company was the same.  My heart was warm. my belly was full and I was feeling prime.  This was a real nice gathering.  And we all had a real good time!"  Many thanks!!<br/>

Maine gathering, as well.  It was great to see some new faces along <br/>
with those we already knew, and the special event box series were a <br/>
lot of fun.<br/>

Looking forward to the next gathering at Wendell!<br/>
