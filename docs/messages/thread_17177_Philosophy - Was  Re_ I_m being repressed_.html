&gt; When any more than a few of us come together there is an <br/>

the <br/>
&gt; very people we need for that power to mean anything.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We know that we can accomplish great things by working together <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; build great societies but we still lust for absolute power over <br/>
all <br/>
&gt; that that cooperation has built. Empathy is the uniquely human <br/>

cooperation <br/>
&gt; and it is the lower animal instinct to dominate that we must <br/>
temper <br/>
&gt; with empathy. This legacy of our animalistic past is the opposing <br/>
&gt; force that prevents us from seeing the benefits of cooperation. It <br/>
&gt; is empathy that grants us that window through which we can see <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; by helping others we help ourselves and that none will benefit <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; dominating the rest. It is in all our best interests to cooperate <br/>
&gt; and work together toward the same purpose but alas let to our own <br/>
&gt; devices, time and again, we succumb to the lust for power.<br/>
