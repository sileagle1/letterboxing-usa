<br/>
Bill and Val of Letterboxing Central have done it again! I highly recommend <br/>
their three-box hike at Mine Hill Preserve in Roxbury, CT...and not just <br/>
because, on this brisk and overcast Sunday, I was the very first letterboxer <br/>
to stake his claim there (woohoo!). Overall, this was about as rewarding a <br/>
letterboxing experience as I've had in the year since I first took up the <br/>
pastime. The reasons were several:<br/>
<br/>
- The clues are relatively straightforward, though at times one needs to pay <br/>
close attention to the descriptions of landmarks (a skill I haven't quite <br/>
mastered yet!).<br/>
<br/>
- The hike itself - a 3.5-mile loop through varied terrain - is not too <br/>
difficult, despite a couple of short, somewhat steep stretches of trail. <br/>
<br/>
- The setting - the extensive remains of a blast furnace, roasting ovens and <br/>
quarries on property now owned by the Roxbury Land Trust - is endlessly <br/>
fascinating and even a little mysterious (the mine shafts and tunnels are <br/>
particularly so). The clues are annotated quite nicely by Bill and Val's <br/>
wonderful description and history of the mining operation that once took <br/>
place here.<br/>
<br/>
- Bill and Val's hand-carved stamps are simple yet elegant. You will <br/>
definitely want to find all three boxes, the reason for which will become <br/>
apparent when/if you find the first one. Even their logbooks are thoughtfully <br/>
crafted!<br/>
<br/>
I've already placed the Mine Hill Preserve series among the top five on my <br/>
list of "best letterboxes in CT". Do something nice for yourself: block out <br/>
the better part an afternoon, drive to Roxbury (it'll be even prettier when <br/>
the leaves turn color) and immerse yourself in this excellent adventure.<br/>
<br/>

Gathering in RI!<br/>

stamps are beautiful and creative!  So I can agree with Alan's high <br/>
rating of the series.  We started the day with rain, but then it <br/>
cleared up and was a wonderful fall-like afternoon.<br/>
