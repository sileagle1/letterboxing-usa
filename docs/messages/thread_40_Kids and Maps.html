<br/>
I teach orienteering skills to middle-level students, and have found <br/>
Cliff Jacobson's "The Basic Essentials of Map &amp; Compass" to be a <br/>
good, inexpensive source of info.<br/>

&gt;  BTW, Bob Summers (AK) is using the Letterbox USA<br/>

&gt;  in his school about letterboxing. Cool, huh?<br/>

&gt;  It would be really neat to make<br/>
&gt;  a letterbox map for kids in the manner of Shepard's 100 acre wood<br/>
&gt;  map in Pooh books ~ you know, a map with drawings of things <br/>
&gt;  .... drawings of trees and bridges, streams, etc. to lead the searcher<br/>
&gt;  to the letterbox.....<br/>

&gt;  Being a rubber stamp fanatic, I am thinking along the lines of creating<br/>
such <br/>
&gt;  a map using simple stamps to make the icons... maybe a bridge, a big<br/>
&gt;  leafy tree, a pine tree, a car (to signify roads), a fish (to signify a<br/>
stream<br/>
&gt;  or pond), a picnic table, a swing set, etc...<br/>
&gt;  ...Once I assembled such a set of stamps, I could use them over and<br/>
&gt;  over to make maps for several letterboxes...<br/>
&gt;  ...I'm just thinking out loud, here, but I thought this idea might appeal<br/>
to <br/>
&gt;  some of the other stamp fanciers out there...<br/>
&gt;  ...Such maps would be really fun to make, and would help make<br/>
&gt;  the hobby of letterboxing available to a younger audience.<br/>

&gt;  I thought the idea of a kid-style map would be great fun so I carved some<br/>
&gt;  little icons and made a map<br/>
&gt;  for my Bob Woodruff Park Letterbox - Plano, TX.  Maybe if my sister and her<br/>
&gt;  kids come to  visit  I can have them try it.  I went to the 100 Aker Wood<br/>
&gt;  site - what a hoot !! My  map is not nearly that cool - but it is still<br/>
fun!!<br/>
&gt;  I am going to send one to Daniel.<br/>

&gt;  Sheila beat me to it by a long shot BUT I did begin to carve an ice<br/>
&gt;  cream cone and a swing stamp to make some map clues for a new box<br/>
&gt;  somewhere in our village.<br/>

Everybody,<br/>
This is so cool... Looks like you really started something, Deborah!!!  As for<br/>
myself, I have yet to find time to even pick up a knife and begin carving the<br/>
stamps I envisioned.  Yet, already, the idea has begun to materialize in Texas<br/>
and Vermont.  This is communication at its finest, my friends.  We are doing<br/>
great things!  Hey, Daniel... looks like your "Kid's Corner" idea is going to<br/>
be a big success!!!<br/>

Here are some websites dedicated to orienteering and proper use of a compass.<br/>
These may contain more information than necessary for the casual letterboxer,<br/>
but they are excellent resources for those who wish to master the art.<br/>

The one site that seems to come alot in the orienteering faqs and pages<br/>
is http://www.uio.no/~kjetikj/compass/, and its a pretty good site.<br/>
Someone who has more time than me :-) (sorry), might want to scope out<br/>
the serveral links that were suggested for compass use, and put the best<br/>
one on the main page or in the letterboxing faq.<br/>

heading out to the park with compass in hand as we speak :-)<br/>

<br/>
I'm into GPS (Global Position System).  In fact I have a unit floating around in<br/>
Texas.  Do you think your students would be interested in trying it?  It can<br/>
show your compass bearing as you move from one point to the next.  At each stop<br/>
you can then mark your location, reckon it to a map, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, let me know and I will ask the TEXANS to forward it to<br/>
you.<br/>

I think the ICQ software will allow that.<br/>
