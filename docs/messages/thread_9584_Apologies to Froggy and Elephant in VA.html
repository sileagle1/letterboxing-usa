I'm so glad someone finally went looking for Elephant Walk, and <br/>
that Wise Owl has flown. As soon as the snow melts a bit, I have <br/>
2 more boxes to plant there, and I'll check on how well hidden <br/>
Elephant is. It's so good to get feedback on boxes and <br/>
hitchhikers, isn't it? Thanks!<br/>
