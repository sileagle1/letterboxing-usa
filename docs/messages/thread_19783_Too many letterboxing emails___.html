<br/>
Some of you who may be experiencing a sudden letterboxing email <br/>
deluge may find this information helpful.  For those of you who are <br/>
receiving a LOT of emails from the various letterboxing yahoo groups <br/>
to which you're subscribed, you can modify your account so as to <br/>
either receive each post individually, a daily digest of all <br/>
messages posted within a day or you can choose to go 'no email' and <br/>
read the messages 'on the board' so to speak where you can glance <br/>
through the subjects of each message and only read the ones in which <br/>
you're interested.  After awhile it can save you a lot of time.<br/>
<br/>
To modify your account, you simply log into yahoo groups by going to <br/>
www.yahoogroups.com  Then click on My Groups.  Then click onto <br/>
whichever group you'd like to modify your account with.  Once it's <br/>
open, you click on the 'Edit My Membership' link in the upper right <br/>
hand corner.  Then go down the next page and look for the Message <br/>
Delivery section--then click on whichever method you'd like to see <br/>
the messages:<br/>
<br/>
O  Individual Emails<br/>
O  Daily Digest<br/>
O  Special Notices<br/>
O  No Email<br/>
<br/>
Then, click on 'Save Changes' at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
For those who choose the 'No Email' option--whenever you want to see <br/>
the messages, you simply log back into yahoogroups.  Click on the <br/>
yahoo group in which you're interested (if you're subscribed to more <br/>
than one discussion group) and then click on 'messages' and you'll <br/>
see all of the messages there.  It really cuts back on your email <br/>
inbox traffic.<br/>
<br/>
Time saved on email browsing = more time to letterbox!!!<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
