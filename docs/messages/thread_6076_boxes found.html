<br/>
We're new to letterboxing and have had a great time the last few<br/>
weekends finding boxes.  We have looked for and found the Ringwood<br/>
letterbox and the Castle Point and Cannonball Trail letterboxes <br/>
(thanks M&amp;P).  All in northern NJ.<br/>
One thing I have found though is that people haven't been cleaning<br/>
the stamps after using them.  Has anyone else had any trouble with<br/>
this?  I do clean them before and after I use them, but if you don't<br/>
think to do it you might have trouble with your own inkpad getting<br/>
preaty dirty.<br/>
anyway, we're having tons of fun!!!!<br/>
