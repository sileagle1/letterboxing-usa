While en route to find letterboxes at Cockaponset State Forest, my 4 <br/>
year old (who is always excited about hiking and letterboxing) began <br/>
running down the trail when he tripped and landed face first on a <br/>
rock.  Blood began coming out of his nose and pouring out of his <br/>
mouth (he had put his teeth into his lip).  After calming him down <br/>
and wiping up lots of blood, I asked him if he wanted to not <br/>
continue, but he insisted on getting the letterboxes!  Does he <br/>
qualify for the Purple Heart?<br/>
