--- In letterbox-usa@yahoogroups.com, "MissMoon" sez:<br/>
&gt; Atlasqest put up Christmas graphics, a small thing, but it gives <br/>
one the feeling that the site is attended to. I never get that <br/>
feeling with LBNA&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly! MissMoon GETS it. That's just the response the <br/>
letterboxing.org website is designed to evoke: you're on holiday at <br/>
your mysterious great aunt Lady Silventine Covington's country <br/>
estate. She has been called away suddenly without explanation and you <br/>
have secretly snuck in to her study. Her walking staff is leaning <br/>
against the wall and the collection case is overflowing with <br/>
curiosities from Africa, Afganistan, Arizona. The scent of old <br/>
tobacco and fresh peppermint linger on the quiet air and you spot her <br/>
cluttered desk. There is an old volume, her regiment patch from the <br/>
Great War, a globe. You ease the door shut with a click and tiptoe <br/>
over to the book, lift its cover...<br/>

&gt; brandished a pistol with the other hand.<br/>
&gt;   "What's this?" I exclamed.<br/>
&gt;    Mr. Peabody was always full of surprises. But this! This was very<br/>
&gt; unexpected. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  "I must know whether your intentions are for good or ill," Mr. Peabody <br/>
&gt; rasped.<br/>
&gt;  "Why, my intentions are the same as yours, surely you know that, my dear <br/>
&gt; cousin.  We haven't seen each other in years, but certainly you remember me <br/>
&gt; better than this," I squeaked, inching my way to the bookshelves behind me.<br/>
<br/>
As I backed warily away from the brandished weapons, I stumbled over<br/>
my aunt's rheumy-eyed bloodhound. He squealed in pain, rose slowly from <br/>
the warm spot he'd claimed on the threadbare Bokhara carpet. As a deep <br/>
rumble sounded from his throat, my left hip brushed against a protruding <br/>
volume, The CompleteWorks of Milton. With a groan and a creak, the entire <br/>
bookshelf swung inward, exposing a lightless corridor.<br/>

<br/>
You're on holiday at your mysterious great aunt Lady Silventine <br/>
Covington's country estate. She has been called away suddenly without <br/>
explanation and you have secretly snuck in to her study. Her walking <br/>
staff is leaning against the wall and the collection case is <br/>
overflowing with curiosities from Africa, Afghanistan, Arizona. The <br/>
scent of old tobacco and fresh peppermint linger on the quiet air and <br/>
you spot her cluttered desk. There is an old volume, her regiment <br/>
patch from the Great War, a globe. You ease the door shut with a <br/>
click and tiptoe over to the book, lift its cover...<br/>
<br/>
and just that moment a you hear a knock on the door. Your heart <br/>
thumping you return to the door and to your surprise your distant<br/>
cousin Major Nathaniel Peabody(USA, ret)is standing in front of you.<br/>
The Major is on a holiday and looking for adventure. He was passing<br/>
by Lady Silventine Covington's estate when he observed lights on.<br/>
The Major has in his possession a map he secured from an obscure<br/>
shop in Havana. He asks you to join his quest.........<br/>
<br/>
But 'ere you depart upon your treasure quest, you first must seek a<br/>
skeleton key that unlocks the drawer containing the code which<br/>
holdeth the true location of the treasure. Unfortunately, that<br/>
skeleton key was sent along its merry way with John Jacob Astor as<br/>
he returned from England to his beautiful home in the Pacific<br/>
Northwest. Needless to say, the key now lies buried either beneath<br/>
the waters of the frigid Atlantic or somewhere in Mr. Astor's<br/>
sprawling estate high atop the bluffs overlooking the mouth of the<br/>
Columbia River (or was that Maryhill???) My dear great aunt, Molly<br/>
M.C. Brown (may she forever rest in peace), always seemed to jumble<br/>
things up a bit. Now we'll never know the truth for it was upon her<br/>
death bed whence she painstakingly gasped out this last kernel of<br/>
knowledge... I wonder if that's the key to the drawer in Havana?<br/>
<br/>
"Never know the truth?" you think, "Bugger this, my curiosity is <br/>
piqued. If the key is lost or unattainable - much like Aunt Molly and <br/>
myself, (respectively), good sir - there is more than one way to open <br/>
a lock."<br/>
<br/>
You reach for the heavy, metal, military-issue knife that your <br/>
eclectic great aunt uses as letter opener.  She leaves it sticking <br/>
upright in the wood of the desk - "Always keep your knife at hand" <br/>
Auntie said, "just in case....well, you know, for letters."<br/>
<br/>
"With my brains and your brawn, Mr. Peabody?" You say, handing him <br/>
the knife and gesturing to the locked drawer.<br/>
  Oddly enough, after picking the lock and opening the drawer, there was a key inside.  Ironic don't you think?  I thought to myself "That can't be the key for what I think it is, can it?"  I took the key and went to where I thought it would work.  It worked.  Upon opening opening the closet, the most horrific image possible was staring me in the face.  It was Lady Covington's....... <br/>

<br/>
Grabbing a bottle of sherry, for who knows how long this adventure might take, I entered the dank corridor that lay ahead, armed with the sherry, a lantern and my wits. While proceeding down the corridor, I noticed that the walls were imprinted with the most oddly shaped characters - almost a pictogram. As I held my lantern to the closest wall . . . <br/>

the dim light disappeared along with all other vision.  The air <br/>
became still and heavy as the bookshelf swung back into place, <br/>
taking with it Milton and my link with my dear Aunt and her <br/>
comforting home.  I heard a shuffle behind me, felt a heavy weight <br/>
lurch against my back, and felt myself thrust to the dusty stone <br/>
walkway as Major Peabody fell against me.<br/>
