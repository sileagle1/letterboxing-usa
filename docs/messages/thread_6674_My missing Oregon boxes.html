boxes appear for the upcoming NW event), 2 of my boxes are missing.  These<br/>
are Rock Creek #1 and "Possum's Penthouse."<br/>
<br/>
The penthouse had fallen across the trail sometime over the winter.  The box<br/>
was still intact, and had been found by local letterboxers.  Since then,<br/>
some miscreant has run off with it (it was attached by a piece of fishing<br/>
line).  Since the hiding place has been compromised I will not be replacing<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Rock Creek #1 has been missing for some time.  I have plans for a new box,<br/>
but the clues will be different enough that it bears scrapping what is up<br/>
now (especially since there is no box).<br/>
<br/>
Poor lonely Rock Creek #2 is doing well.  Stamps from near &amp; far.<br/>
