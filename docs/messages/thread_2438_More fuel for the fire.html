<p>Greetings,<span></span></p>
<p><span>        
 </span>Being knowledgable about preparedness and off the road safety don’t 
necessarily equate with some unstated letterbox hiking distances!</p>
<p><span>            
</span>A year ago, August 2000, my team partner Bob LaBelle, who has climbed Mt. 
Aconcagua at 22,000+ feet in South America, and I, an end-to-ender on the Finger 
Lakes Trail in New York, totaling nearly 600 miles, searched for a letterbox in 
Central New York.<span>  </span>After adjusting 
to an erroneously stated starting point in the clues, we hiked for three 
hours.<span>  </span>We were smart enough to call 
it quits.</p>
<p><span>            
</span>This spring, the area being familiar to us, and part of the Finger Lakes 
Trail area, we checked a topo map and went in the back way by car.<span>  </span>We located the site after walking in  
mile; we found the container; it was empty of contents.</p>
<p><span>            
</span>Based on our projections from the topo map, had we been able to follow 
the clues in August 2000 we would have had to hike ten miles!<span>  </span>People on horseback undoubtedly placed 
the letterbox.<span>  </span>See Alpine letterbox 
in Central &amp; Western NY of LbNA site.</p>
<p><span>            
</span>As a letterboxer I feel we have a certain responsibility; the question is 
– to whom?</p>
