                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Guys, <br/>
I've been watching the emails on ticks and thought I'd share a piece <br/>
from a personal email I wrote to someone. The portion I've enclosed <br/>
might be beneficial to someone regarding ticks.<br/>
 It's as follows:<br/>
<br/>
 I guess I shall keep a close watch on this. I'm not one to  <br/>
 give up going in the woods becasue of ticks and I usually do  <br/>
 watch for them and check upon leaving the woods &amp; fields. I'm  <br/>
 a bird watcher as well as a boxer, and as I've grown older, I  <br/>
 realize life is so very short and one should get out there &amp;  <br/>
 soak up the nature we have. BUT I also have shown positive  <br/>
 several times. Did the antibiotics each time for 12 weeks.  <br/>
 They're are 13 bands in the blood levels and a lyme free  <br/>
 person shows they sit at zero, A full 13 bands indicates  <br/>
 being very sick and I sit constantly at band level 4. I can  <br/>
 live with this but I am aware of trying to be careful and for  <br/>
 my dog as well. <br/>
 The one thing my now retired doctor said was to get guinee  <br/>
 hens. Yeah, I laughed too! They eat ticks and prefer them to all  <br/>
else. Two guinee hens can keep 1 acre plus of land tick free. So of <br/>
course  I ran out that year and bought 12 guinee hens. I have over 8 <br/>
acres  <br/>
 but they were able to roam around on 5 or so. The good news  <br/>
 is the doctor was right. I never picked ticks off myself or  <br/>
 the dog ( or the cats)for an entire summer. NOT ONE! Then the <br/>
wildlife,  <br/>
 (coyotes, fox, hawks, etc.) got my guinee hens one by one  <br/>
 until fall I had only one left and he soon beame a meal as  <br/>
 well. That worked so well, I am considering doing it again.  <br/>
 Maybe I should suggest that online w/LBNA. That might help  <br/>
 some folks. Thanks for your input. By the way, I had all  <br/>
 three shots from the doctor, within a three month+ period. We  <br/>
 (he &amp; I ) did the first one, 30 days later did the 2nd one,  <br/>
 and the last one was suppose to be a year later as you said,  <br/>
 but we did it 2 months later. So I had all three shots within  <br/>
 3 1/2 monthsThis year the rats, mice, moles, ticks all  <br/>
 prevalant due to warm winter. We have many extra hawks so my  <br/>
 new hens won't last long. <br/>
 I still wear light clothing and try to remember to pull my socks up <br/>
over my jeans. Deet is good, strong but good.<br/>
 Always a struggle! <br/>
 Always in the woods <br/>

<br/>
So....I realize many folks can't do guinee hens, and some don't want <br/>
the extra work, cleaning the hen houses and feeding the little guys, <br/>
but for some, those of you who try this, you'll be amazed at how well <br/>
it's works. <br/>
Good Luck....<br/>

We would certainly be deemed the "strange wood folk". Very funny! I named all 12 of my hens Edward because they were all identical. Just imagine walking Edward in the woods on a levender lease. Wow...what a thought, you're too funnny.<br/>
