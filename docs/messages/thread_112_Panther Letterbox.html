and sunny day, we decided it was really time fine a letterbox. Suzi and<br/>
I, along with our son Ben abd his friend Jonathan, went off in search of<br/>
Tom Cooch's lettergoxes <br/>
<br/>
The Braintree Panther was our first stop. Wondering about the first clue<br/>
(Pole of Pride) when along came a dog and, well, pridefully marked an<br/>
object for us - it turned out to be the right clue, and, lo and behold,<br/>
he ran off towards the second clue destination as well.<br/>
<br/>
The box was found, and, while Jon and I stamped up, Susan carved (115<br/>
minutes max) a beautiful initial and dragon stamp for Ben to use. Quite<br/>
lovely, no fuss, she just did it. I am amazed.<br/>
<br/>
We packed up and went off to Rolling Rock  alas, the quest was not to be<br/>
successful. The clue was nicely cryptic, but we did decipher it<br/>
correctly, but alas, the box was too well hidden. <br/>
<br/>
As it was nearing dusk, and, still muzzle-loading season, we decided<br/>
that  irt was time to head for Tom's for a cup of tea. There, he<br/>
verified that we were right in our solution to his clues, and said no<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really impressed with Tom's work on behalf of this sport. His<br/>
letterbook concept is great - he has the librarian actively involved,<br/>
and is getting his students involved (see teh new box just installed<br/>
today near Tom's). All in all, it was a great day. And, best of all,<br/>
there are three more awaiting...<br/>
