<br/>
Laughlin Carp Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Azroadie<br/>
Placement date: April 2, 2004<br/>
State:  Nevada<br/>
County:   Clark<br/>
Nearest city:  Laughlin<br/>
Difficulty:   Clues &amp; walk   very easy<br/>
<br/>
This box is located at the north edge of Laughlin.  Park in <br/>
the "Fisherman's Access Area" lot which is at the southeast corner <br/>
of Casino Dr. and SR 163 (="the road over the bridge")<br/>
<br/>
Walk north on Casino Dr.  The easiest way to do this is to walk <br/>
under the bridge and go up the other side to the road [you can try <br/>
walking west along SR163 and cross where Casino Dr. comes in from <br/>
the north; however, this looks difficult and dangerous!].  Continue <br/>
walking north on Casino Dr.  You will pass a "Speed Limit 35" sign.  <br/>
The next road sign is a small one that says "Overnight Camping in <br/>
this Area Prohibited" (it is almost at the end of the steel <br/>
railing).  From this sign go at about 224 degrees (from north) for <br/>
about 74 paces to a small lone Mesquite tree on a small hill or rise <br/>
between two ridges.  The box is at the west side of the Mesquite <br/>
under some rocks.  Be alert for snakes and scorpions.  Enjoy the <br/>
view of the Colorado River.  The first person will find a surprise!<br/>
<br/>
I will not be able to check on this box; so, please let me know if <br/>
you find it.  Also, let me know if it is missing so that I can <br/>
delete the clues:<br/>

This box is in my "Colorado River Series".  The other one is "Yuma <br/>
Prison".<br/>
