<br/>
It's still up in the air whether I/we will attend the gathering in<br/>
Steilacoom on November 2nd.  I may get lucky, though.  It's not long<br/>
away now and I'm excited at the thought of going if I can.  <br/>
<br/>
If I or we do get to go, it will probably be a same day drive up.  With<br/>
all the cool people that intend to be there (yes, even Ryan is actually<br/>
cool, if not always diplomatic -- and he will redeem himself with a<br/>
wonderfully-carved event stamp, I can almost guarantee), it would seem a<br/>
terrible shame not to attend.  <br/>
<br/>
So...if you see me or both John and myself at the event, we got lucky<br/>
and will be thrilled to meet up with you all.  <br/>
<br/>

Hey, I've been known for carving some pretty crappy stamps.  <br/>
You should see the one I finished a couple of weeks ago!  It's <br/>
GOT to be the crappiest I've ever made!  Which is okay....  I just <br/>
need to figure out a good place to hide it.  =)<br/>
<br/>
As for the event stamp, though, I promise to try to do better!  It <br/>
may not be the best stamp I've ever carved, but it'll be <br/>
memorable!  (Memorable in a good way! *smile*)<br/>
<br/>
I'll tell you this much about it, though: It's turning out to be the <br/>
biggest honking stamp I've ever created!  I hope everyone's got <br/>
some big notebooks to stamp in with.  And it wouldn't hurt to <br/>
bring some colored markers along either....  :o)  (Applicable to <br/>
the event stamp and the one I've already hidden at Lakewood.)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've received several 'unofficial' RSVPs for the 2 Nov South Sound LB <br/>
Quest Fest in Lakewood, WA so far (I apologize if I forget anybody <br/>
because I am out of town and away from my 'own' computer), but here <br/>
goes:<br/>
<br/>
-dvn2r ckr &amp; kids (hubby has to work)<br/>
-Fudrickus<br/>
-Hoopoe of Federal Way<br/>
-Quilting Noni of Mercer Island<br/>
-The 7 Nails (possibly 6 though since the eldest is into his own <br/>
thing these days)<br/>
-Sun Seeker &amp; DZ Purple (I think I have this name incorrect)<br/>
-Mischief in WA<br/>
-Ryan of Portland<br/>
<br/>
I think there are others but I haven't slept in a LONG WHILE so my <br/>
memory isn't the greatest.  Possibly TeaThyme &amp; partner (whose name I <br/>
unfortunately can't recall at the moment), Amanda B (Paisley Orca) <br/>
and some others.<br/>
<br/>
There will also be several other 'visitors'...  ;)<br/>
<br/>
See you on the 2nd!!!<br/>
