<br/>
I post my message again because I'm not sure the first worked.<br/>
I'm a french journalist and I'm writing an article about <br/>
letterboxing. <br/>
In France letterboxing doesn't exist.<br/>
But I need pictures to illustrate my writing.<br/>
So coud you help me and send me pictures about stamps and your <br/>
hunts ? The magazine is new one (Thesaumag is a magazine about <br/>
treasures hunt) so it doesn't have money for buy pictures.<br/>
But I promise to send a magazine after its publication to the people <br/>
whom pictures I will choose.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much for your help.<br/>
Maybe my article will do the same effect as the smithsonian one ;)<br/>
<br/>
Yours<br/>
<br/>
Elisabeth Roman<br/>
