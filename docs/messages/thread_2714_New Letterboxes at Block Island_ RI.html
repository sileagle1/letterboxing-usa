   Three more letterboxes, best done in conjunction with White Rock at Black<br/>
Rock Letterbox.  We highly suggest renting bikes, as our third box is a good<br/>
distance away.  Pick up a map of the island as you exit the ferry at the<br/>
information booth (or get one free as you rent a bike).<br/>

Southeast Lighthouse Letterbox<br/>
Placed 6/29/01 by Ann &amp; Kathryn T<br/>
<br/>
 Starting at Old Harbor, the arrival place for ferries from both Point<br/>
Judith and New London, take a left out of the parking lot.  At the fork in<br/>
the road, continue straight through following Southeast Road.  Come to the<br/>
entrance of the Southeast Lighthouse about one mile up.  Enter the<br/>
 "driveway" of the lighthouse, leaving bikes outside the gate.  About 50<br/>
yards inside the fence you will see a pile of big rocks and overgrowth off<br/>
to your left.  Locate the big "sitting rock", the only horizontal one there.<br/>
Scoot up there, sit on the rock facing the lighthouse.  Look down in a<br/>
crevasse to your left behind a piece of old wood to find the box.  This is a<br/>
heavily traveled area.  Consider moving at least to the adjacent crescent of<br/>
sitting stones to stamp in, if not further.  Don't forget to go out past the<br/>
lighthouse for a great view of the Mohegan Bluffs.  Place the box back<br/>
carefully.  (Having kids with you who are always climbing on rocks would be<br/>
a great cover.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Indian Cemetery Lighthouse<br/>
Placed 7/1/01<br/>
<br/>
 Coming out of the Southeast Light, continue left on Southeast Road.  (Just<br/>
down the road is the entrance to Mohegan Bluffs, a great look-out point.<br/>
Trudge down the stairway for a close-up look if you have the time and the<br/>
energy.)  Continue on Southeast Road about a mile until you come to a big<br/>
pond,  Fresh Pond.  Across from the pond on the hill is the Indian Cemetery,<br/>
surrounded by a stone wall.  This burying ground dates back almost three<br/>
hundred years to the earliest settlers on the island.  Island Indians,<br/>
Indian bond-servants and Negro slaves and their descendants are buried here.<br/>
Enter the cemetery and locate the gravestone of Captain Charles R. Paine.<br/>
&gt;From this point, take a bearing of 200 degrees towards the stone wall.  Find<br/>
a large granite rectangular stone along the top of the wall.  The letterbox<br/>
is about one yard to the left of this large stone, low in the wall.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tap into the directions for White Rock at Black Rock here for a great walk<br/>
to the water.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
North Lighthouse Letterbox<br/>
Placed 7/1/01<br/>
<br/>
 If you went onto West Side Road and into Rodman's Hollow to find White Rock<br/>
at Black Rock, continue left on West Side Road as you come out of the<br/>
hollow, going  left on Beach Avenue and left again on Corn Neck Road for a<br/>
three mile ride out to the North Lighthouse.  If not, then take a right out<br/>
of the Indian Cemetery on Center Road.  This will turn into Beach Avenue.<br/>
At its end turn left onto Corn Neck Road and follow this to its end.  Park<br/>
bikes at the parking lot and slog on down to the lighthouse.  This is a<br/>
sensitive area, so stay on the trails as much as possible.  Seagulls are<br/>
quick to let you know if you are too near their nesting areas.  At the<br/>
northwest corner of the lighthouse, find a trail down towards the water.  As<br/>
the trail rises up a dune, find a smaller trail to your right, heading back<br/>
towards the lighthouse.  From here you can see a stone "paved" area lying<br/>
just below the north face of the lighthouse.  The letterbox is located under<br/>
one of these "paving stones".  Look for a rectangular, dark gray stone<br/>
heavily striated with white.  One stripe is at least an inch thick, the<br/>
others much smaller.  The stone lies to the left side of the area (but not<br/>
right near the left edge) about midway up.  Please close up the box securely<br/>
and replace carefully.  To return to town, follow Corn Neck Road back to Old<br/>
Harbor.<br/>
