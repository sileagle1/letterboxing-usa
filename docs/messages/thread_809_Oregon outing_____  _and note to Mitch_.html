&gt;  Yahoo! Well, I'm glad someone has searched for at leat one of my<br/>
&gt;  letterboxes! :) I nearly placed two more yesterday, but spent a great many<br/>
&gt;  hours hiking in and around Mitch's waterfall series! It was too dark when I<br/>
&gt;  was done to venture in to Oxbow park.<br/>
<br/>
I've been bitching and whining about going to search for them since you<br/>
posted... I finally just decided I would go on my own.  Guess I will try<br/>
that tack in the future!<br/>
<br/>
I have been after Mitch's rebus box since he placed it...  now that the<br/>
blackberries have died back I will try again!!  It is only about 2 miles<br/>
from where I sit typing this!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Thom, I'm glad you guys found at least one box...was it in OK condition?<br/>
<br/>
perfect condition!  Great stamp by the way!!  I brought blue and green<br/>
stamp pads and did a groovy two color stamp in my book!!  I won't<br/>
divulge the details.. it was a nice surprise!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The second box...I was wondering if I phrased the clue all right...It's actually<br/>
&gt;  to be read on the right side as if you were coming IN to the park <br/>
<br/>
Got it....  I am co-hosting a 4X4 swap meet and pancake breakfast this<br/>
weekend in Wood Village.... maybe I'll get a free hour to go back and<br/>
bag the second box!  Stop by if you are in the neighborhood &amp; I'll treat<br/>
you and Kevin to free flapjacks &amp; scrambled eggs!<br/>

<br/>
A note to Mitch: I couldn't find the Multnomah Falls box (with the five<br/>
trees)...I think maybe that area is fenced off due to storm damage.  I found<br/>
the ponytail falls one (very wet inside the box, but the stamp book etc are<br/>
dry as a bone).  The triple falls box was perfectly dry.  Wow, I hadn't<br/>
hiked there before - it is really stunning! It feels so primordial with the<br/>
waterfalls, red cedar and ferns...besides, it was misty and raining all day,<br/>
and that added to the mystery of the landscape. I hunted high and low for<br/>
the box near the memorial for the 14 yr. old but couldn't find it! Any<br/>
clues? <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The weather was just a little tooo nice this weekend...  I printed out<br/>
Cara's clues in Oxbow Park and threw a bag full of stamps &amp; inkpads into<br/>
the truck (my compass and stampbook are ALWAYS in the truck).  Brian<br/>
decided to forego a morning of Pokemon to join me.<br/>
<br/>
We live west of Portland, behind the West Hills.  As such, we miss a lot<br/>
of the cold wind that blows out of the Gorge.  When we got within 5<br/>
miles of the mouth of the Gorge the wind was HOWLING.  Fortunately Oxbow<br/>
Park sets back into the foothills of the Cascades enough to provide some<br/>
shelter.<br/>
<br/>
The trail to Oxbow #1 runs right along and above the Sandy River.  We<br/>
have seen salmon spawning on past trips to this park, but none today.  A<br/>
few Steelhead fishermen were working the gravel bars and we waved to 2<br/>
different drift boats as they floated by.  It was brisk out, but dry. <br/>
We did some rockhounding along the bank of the river, but not much to<br/>
find and keep, just tumbled basalt and volcanic stone urped from Mt.<br/>
Hood.  We puzzled over the clues a little.... but were successful in the<br/>
end and stamped up on a damp log nearby!!<br/>
<br/>
We got near box #2, but impending birthday party commitments made us<br/>
abandon the search for another day!<br/>
<br/>
Question to Cara.... box 2 begins with instructions to start on trail <br/>
"D" on the RIGHT side of the road.  Does this mean the right side of the<br/>
road as you drive IN to the Park or the right side as you drive back<br/>
from the amphitheatre??  We assumed the latter &amp; the first clue or two<br/>
seemed to support that decision.... however, we couldn't find the long<br/>
downed log nor the wood &amp; rope handrail.  HELP!!<br/>
<br/>
letterboxing... alive in Oregon!!!!<br/>

much lately, 'cause I've been so busy with school.<br/>
<br/>
Cara:  I'll have to make it out to Multnomah Falls and check on the location. <br/>
 It is very possible that storm damage could have reached it, or at least <br/>
caused that area to be fenced off.  I will also have to try and make it up to <br/>
the one near the memorial.  There is a little side path nearby that leads to <br/>
the rock that the box should be under.<br/>
<br/>
Thom:  I made it out to Bronson Creek a few days ago and found that the rebus <br/>
box is missing.  I had checked after your first attempt to find it, and it <br/>
was still there at that time, but it is gone now.  I will let you know when I <br/>
have replaced it.<br/>
