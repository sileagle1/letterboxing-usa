I'm heading up that way (actually will be in Wilbraham) this weekend and <br/>
would love to add to my stamp collection of one!  :)  Is there anything <br/>
easy and quick, since I won't be visiting letterboxers, and won't have a <br/>
lot of time?  I know you New Englanders are letterbox crazy...  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

Also, my 2 cents on the stamp pad issue, the Drew clan box that I found had <br/>
a little pigment pad in it.  (about 1 inch big?)  Even though I had my own <br/>
with me, it was neat to have one there, so I will have different colors in <br/>
my book.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Marisa, at this time of year I would say that none of the boxes I have<br/>
hidden in western Mass. would be "easy and quick."  There's a certain<br/>
amount of hiking involved for each and I have no idea what the trails might<br/>
be like.  However, that said, the two I have hidden at the Quabbin<br/>
Reservoir are not very complicated.  I have friends who found them on New<br/>
Year's Day, but that was before we had had any snow.<br/>
<br/>
The Mount Sugarloaf and Wendell State Forest boxes involve trails that I<br/>
would not recommend at this time of year unless you have the equipment<br/>
necessary for winter hiking.  The boxes hidden by the Drew clan on the<br/>
Holyoke range are close to Springfield, but they involve rather steep, long<br/>
climbs.  Definitely not quick and easy, even in summer!  In fact, I think<br/>
in their clues they discourage hunting for those boxes in winter.<br/>
<br/>
My sister Betsey has hidden two in Belmont which I think might be good<br/>
candidates for you, except that they are rather far east!<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome, Marisa!!! Wilbraham, that's near Ludlow (home of New Engalnd's<br/>
best Portugese bakery), sort of the intersection of the MassPike (I-90)<br/>
and I-91, right? We've got just the boxes for you: I suggest either of<br/>
two series just north of town, or one just south. Both are really easy<br/>
to get to from 91. To the north are "North Mount Sugarloaf" and<br/>
"Quabbin Resivoir" (which is really two boxes on one path). They're at: <br/>
<br/>
http://www.sover.net/~tcooch/amherst.htm<br/>
<br/>
Or, just to the south, try "Tobacco River" at:<br/>

<br/>
And have a really terrific time! Jay<br/>

Sorry I didn't read your note first, Bonnie! Didn't mean to contradict<br/>
you by recommending Mt Sugarloaf. If this spring-like weather holds<br/>
out, though, both Quabbin and Tobacco River should be gorgeous and<br/>
close for you, Marisa, and no biting bugs.<br/>
