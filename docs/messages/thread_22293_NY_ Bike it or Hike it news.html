Wow!  When I read this <br/>
post, it brought back <br/>
memories!  I grew up in <br/>
Saratoga springs and lived <br/>
there for 35 years.  Moved <br/>
to Louisiana a little over <br/>
5 years ago.  My sister <br/>
still lives up there, told <br/>
her about letterboxing.  <br/>
She said she had stumbled <br/>
across one by accident at <br/>
the Battlefield, but didn't <br/>
know what it was, so left <br/>
it alone.  Now she does.  <br/>
There are ALOT of them up <br/>
there and can't wait till <br/>
the day I get a chance to <br/>
go up and find some.  <br/>

I don't know about that one &amp; I live in Saratoga Springs. There are no clues <br/>

thrilled for all these new bike it/hike it boxes in the area. There aren't very many <br/>
boxes around here unless you want to take a long drive. Thanks!<br/>

It might be a geocache, as I ran into a geocacher while hiding one of <br/>
my letterboxes in watertown. He said there were a bunch in the area.<br/>

Okay, DUH!  Too much hot <br/>
Louisiana sun on my head.  <br/>
It was a Geocache she <br/>
found, sorry, sometimes I <br/>
get my letterboxes and <br/>
geocaches mixed up.  And I <br/>
am not really sure where <br/>
she was when she found the <br/>
box, thought she said the <br/>
battlefield, but she goes <br/>
all over the place and hits <br/>
all the mountains.  I am <br/>
trying to lure her into <br/>
both activities, but it is <br/>
hard to convince someone <br/>
from so far away.  I am <br/>
ready to take my punishment <br/>
for getting you all excited <br/>
and then popping your <br/>
balloon!  :(  Sequoia_2<br/>
