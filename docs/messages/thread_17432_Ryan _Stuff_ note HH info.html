Irishtinker don't want theirs at gatherings- if I should have the good fortune to find <br/>
one and be heading to a gather.<br/>
Sometimes I just look at them and stay out of the stamping frenzy and hope to <br/>
find some later...<br/>

I would, but unfortunately I released my hitchhikers before taking <br/>
them to gatherings became a common practice.  However, I'd be <br/>
THRILLED if anyone that has my hitchhikers could add such a note to <br/>
the logbook!<br/>
<br/>
Future hitchhikers should be a problem, though, because I've stopped <br/>
making them.  Too few people report finding them, too many are <br/>
floating around out there, and I don't want to risk them showing up <br/>
at events without permission.  So I just don't plant hitchhikers <br/>
anymore.  I'm THIS close to putting out a recall on all my <br/>
hitchhikers, but for now am letting them run loose.  But I might <br/>
change my mind on that if they keep showing up at gatherings.<br/>
