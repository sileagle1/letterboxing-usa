<p>It was tough to find a great location for this box as the church keeps the grounds and even under the trees clean of good hidding places....but I accomplished it so feedback is werlcome....</p>
<p>"The Grotto"</p>
<p>Placed by the Canada Goose</p>
<p>June 22, 2002</p>
<p>City of Portland Oregon</p>
<p>County Multnomah</p>
<p>"The Grotto Story began just before the turn of the century when a young boy learned that his mother lay near death after giving birth to a daughter. In tears the boy ran to the little parish church in Kitchener, Ontario Canada where he prayed for his mothers life, promising that if she were spared he would one day undertake a great work for the Church. His mother survived and the future Father Ambrose Mayer never forgot his promise. In 1923 Father Mayer made a bid on property owned by the Union Pacific Railroad Company for $3,000. Asking price was $48,000 but his bid was accepted. On May 29<sup>th,</sup> 1924, Portland Archbishop Alexander Christie dedicated the Sanctuary of Our Sorrowful Mother."</p>
<p>There is a small fee to enter the gardens above the grotto itself and this is where you need to venture for the letterbox.</p>
<p>Once you are on top the cliff over looking NE Portland you need to find the gardens map. Note the direction of the arrows and follow the path. Observe the statues and signs along the way. Your goal is to fine the monument dedicated in 1933. It is a gift from the Catholic Daughters of the Americas. Once you have found it look for the second yellow arrow and follow it almost exactly. Watch for the second stump/ pillar from the beginning of the fence. You will need to resurrect the letterbox from near your feet.</p>
<p>Good luck! Keep me posted on the box . I hope I hid it good enough so those clean freaky gardeners miss it! Ha ha...</p>
