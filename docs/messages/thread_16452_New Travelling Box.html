                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, since Pandora cannot get out and box and has asked for an anti-<br/>
boredom remedy, Team PresSinOn decided to come up with a new box, in <br/>
her honor. It's called the Letterbox Boredom Buster. Besides having a <br/>
stamp and a logbook, it also has some goodies to keep those confined <br/>
and unable to box busy for a spell. It kind of runs along the same <br/>
lines as the Purple Heart box. Anyone who is confined and not able to <br/>
get out and box for one reason or another is welcome to request the <br/>
box. This could be someone who's had surgery, broke a body part, is <br/>
confined to a wheelchair and not able to get to alot of boxes, or <br/>
even if you're just having a *really* bad winter and the snow has <br/>
kept you from going anywhere, etc...etc...etc. (I think you all get <br/>
the picture.) ;)<br/>
Pandora now has the box in her possesion and says she's enjoying it. <br/>
Iron Bear will also be stamping into it since he's stuck at home <br/>
taking care of Pandora.  She'll have it until someone else is in need <br/>
of it. Just post that you need it, and she'll send it off to you. <br/>
Then you can keep it till the next person needs it, or contact me and <br/>
you can send it back to me for good keeping until needed again. We'll <br/>
all be on the honor system as to who really needs it. It's not like <br/>
I'm gonna ask for a drs. note or anything. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Keep on 'Boxin',<br/>
NeverEnuff of Team PresSinOn<br/>
