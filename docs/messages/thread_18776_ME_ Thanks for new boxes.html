boxes placed by "Giddy". Isosceles and I really enjoyed our travels last weekend and <br/>
the Daffodil letterbox was such a treat. It is probably well past Daffodil season in <br/>
most other parts of the country, but for us northern folk, there is still time to <br/>
capture this moment. <br/>
<br/>
And, it is high time that the experimental forest in that area had more boxes - way <br/>
to go! Thanks for all the new boxes Giddy.<br/>
