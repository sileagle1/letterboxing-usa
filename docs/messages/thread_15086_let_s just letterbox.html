&gt;Subject: [LbNA] let's just  letterbox<br/>
&gt;Date: Wed, 13 Aug 2003 21:23:39 -0400<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Reading all the discussions about databases and other problems lately took <br/>
&gt;me back to when I first, accidentally found out about this sport. It was <br/>
&gt;not that long ago (Last March) that I found my first stamp and since then <br/>
&gt;have found 30 and placed 3 of my own out there. In the search of the <br/>
&gt;elusive stamp I've found much more, Parks and Greenways I didn't know about <br/>
&gt;or probably would never have visited because of their small size. In them I <br/>
&gt;have found deer, bald eagles, hawks, waterfalls, historic ruins and yes, a <br/>
&gt;small stamp in a plastic box.  When checking my boxes, it seems the <br/>
&gt;comments left by visiting Letterboxers (60 Plus) feel the same way. In the <br/>
&gt;journals there are no old timers or newbies, it's hard to believe that you <br/>
&gt;can have either with a sport that's only be in this country for 5 or so <br/>
&gt;years.  As for the database, I live in Rhode Island and there's a phobia <br/>
&gt;called the Rhode Island Mentality. If you drive more than 15 minutes from <br/>
&gt;home it's an adventure, an hour it's a weekend trip. So for those inflicted <br/>
&gt;by this phobia the database is a great thing. (I'm original from Kansas so <br/>
&gt;I'm not inflicted with this illness.) So if you don't want your sites <br/>
&gt;listed on the database, note it on your clues page and I'm sure almost all <br/>
&gt;will honor your wishes. It's time to end this debate and get out there , <br/>
&gt;enjoy  nature and let us know about the parts of your treks that don't give <br/>
&gt;clues away.<br/>
