                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Letterboxing Community, <br/>
<br/>
     To all, a thank you for a game well played. <br/>
<br/>
     The culprit, you ask? Investigator Bacon did not<br/>
share this information with me, saying that it was up<br/>
to you, the letterboxing community, to restore the<br/>
missing Store of Good Manners. I would like to take<br/>
this time to encourage those of you who already have<br/>
the key to this mysterious case to continue in your<br/>
diligence toward the final solution. For those of you<br/>
who are just beginning the quest, send word to me and<br/>
I will share what information Investigator Bacon has<br/>
gathered in his investigation.<br/>
<br/>
     For all the points of etiquette that have been<br/>
mentioned, I wish to thank the following players of<br/>
the game: Der Mad Stamper, Stealthboxxer, Mark Pepe,<br/>
Archimedes Screw, Mountain Scorpia, Gallant Rogue,<br/>
Dude the Wonder Dog, Hikers &amp; Hounds, Safari Man,<br/>
Barefoot Lucy, Silver Eagle,Don, Wassamatta_u,<br/>
Wisconsin Hiker, Lnd-Crzr, Y-Nought, Dragonrider, Knit<br/>
Wit, Eidolon, SpringChick and Speedsquare. They are<br/>
indeed worthy of their reputations as caring members<br/>
of the letterboxing community, with very good advice<br/>
for those who care to listen. These individuals gave<br/>
of themselves, without knowing what their roles would<br/>
be, who the guilty parties are, or even who<br/>
Investigator Bacon and I are. Yes, these esteemed<br/>
individuals are worthy of your praise, for they embody<br/>
the very essence of the mysterious nature of<br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
    Now, as Mark Pepe would say, "Have fun and just<br/>
get out there and box!!!"  <br/>
<br/>
Truly, <br/>
<br/>
Ms. Emily Post<br/>
