Can they be mailed across country? I've only found 66 boxes, but haven't<br/>
found any hitch hikers yet (except the one that I stamped when I was with<br/>
the person who placed it, but I didn't count that one). If you're finding<br/>
too many, start collecting and asking for addresses :-) They wouldn't count<br/>
as 'finds', but it would be a cool way to get ones from far away when you're<br/>
like me and can't travel across country.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Too Many Hitchhikers<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Are there too many hitchhikers out there...I have been having<br/>
&gt; discussions with other letterboxers (off of the board) and that has<br/>
&gt; been a major topic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It seems like every box we find has a hitchhiker in it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know that you can just leave the hitchhiker for someone else to<br/>
&gt; deal with, but I find that hitchhikers are the Lazy Man's letterboxes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All someone has to do is get the stamp (often not even a hand carved<br/>
&gt; stamp!) and put it in some zip-locks with a logbook. No clues to<br/>
&gt; write, no box to buy. Very Lazy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Forget about trashing the geocachers, let's address the flood of<br/>
&gt; hitchhikers out there! Do we really need more???<br/>
