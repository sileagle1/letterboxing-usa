You have been struck by the letterbox crook. The teddy bear microbox <br/>
has been removed from its location and destroyed. This should serve <br/>
as a message to stop taking part in such a foolish pasttime. <br/>
Letterboxing is a scourge and I personally will stamp it out. The <br/>
teddy bear microbox was not been the first and will not be the last <br/>
either.<br/>

I hope that's a joke, albeit in very poor taste.<br/>
<br/>
If it's not, I'll bet this person also steals from charities at<br/>
Christmas, too.<br/>
<br/>
The karma alone is scary to contemplate, if this is for real.  We can<br/>
replace letterboxes, but anyone who'd do something like that is asking<br/>
for malicious mischief to follow him/her, forever.<br/>
<br/>
Still hoping it's a joke,<br/>

If it isn't, someone in his area needs to post a new letterbox specifically for him to find. <br/>
Make sure you hide it in a nice big patch of poison ivy. Maybe next to a hornet's nest.<br/>

I keep thinking of the email line, "Letterboxing is a scourge and I personally will stamp it out."  I know its wrong to say, but just think of the F-count s/he could collect by personally stamping out letterboxing! <br/>

Why in the world would someone want to do this?  My next question is <br/>
what happens if he happens up on one of us out on the trail while <br/>
searching for a box?  Is this guy for real and if he is trying to <br/>
stamp out letterboxing does that mean that he intends to stamp out <br/>
letterboxers?  Please until we know more, everyone be extra <br/>
careful.  The last box me and my 2 small children went to find was <br/>
quite a hike and on the day that we went the area was very <br/>
deserted.  I am not a scairy person but something just didn't feel <br/>
right.  We had been on a trip and my husband had left the pistol in <br/>
my SUV.  I have never done it before, but I actually tucked the <br/>
pistol in under the wagon we took with us that day.  So once again, <br/>
please everyone take extra precautions.<br/>

but maybe the better course of action would have been to go for a box in<br/>
another location. There have been several times that I have arrived at a<br/>
park and gotten "bad vibes". Being of advanced age, I have learned to trust<br/>
my gut feelings..........I promptly got back in my car and left, checking<br/>
the mirrors for several miles to make sure I wasn't being followed. I had<br/>
The Mabes with me at the time, and she fought off a pit bull to protect me<br/>
about 2 years ago, but even so, I felt it was more prudent to just go on to<br/>
the next box. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, I understand that texasluvbug1's bringing a gun may be abhorrent to you<br/>
 Maybe gun ownership is not part of your culture- I don't know what part of<br/>
the country you are from- maybe you just hate guns. However, if your goal is<br/>
to decrease gun ownership or increase gun safety awareness, you may find<br/>
that "you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar". <br/>

Did you really bring a gun out with your kids there? <br/>
That's strange and rather frightening.  Please say you<br/>
were using a hyperbole.  If not, what is wrong with<br/>
you?  I could care about the letterboxing crook if<br/>
you're out there.  What a loose cannon....yikes.<br/>
