                    <div class="plaintext-content">I understand your search for a road atlas, but I might also suggest getting<br/>
the laminated folding state maps to use.  They are a little more expensive<br/>
than paper maps, but well worth the difference.<br/>
<br/>
I have one I normally keep in my LB notebook and I've taken a dry erase<br/>
marker and outlined the counties (they were already there, I just emphasized<br/>
the boundaries), then I marked the number of boxes in each county that I<br/>
haven't yet gotten.  If I'm planning an outing, it's amenable to seeing<br/>
where concentrations are.  It's easy to change as boxes are added or as I<br/>
work an area.  I black in a county I've already worked and if I'm going to a<br/>
given area, I erase the markings and enlarge the map of the area on my<br/>
printer and put the enlarged map in a sheet protector and on into my<br/>
notebook.  I then remark it after I've finished the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I've misplaced my regular LB notebook, so I had to make a new<br/>
one for an outing yesterday and I didn't have my map.  I didn't realize how<br/>
much I rely on it.<br/>

Try the DeLorme Atlas &amp; Gazetteers. Amazon has them for 12.97 (much <br/>
less than the 19.95 list price):<br/>
http://tinyurl.com/nec4l<br/>
I've seen them at Wal-Mart and other stores, too.<br/>
<br/>
Clueless &amp; I were out Saturday with Mark &amp; Sue, and at one point we <br/>
went to our respective cars to grab maps to plan the next leg of our <br/>
journey, and I chuckled when we both came back with CT Gazetteers, <br/>
each dogeared and with post it notes and bookmarks. For large states, <br/>
they don't have as much detail as they do for smaller states, but <br/>
they have just enough info to help you navigate in either case.<br/>

paper.  Looks like you are 'painting' the paper with this product and <br/>
folding would be easier but many local state park maps are only about <br/>
the size of a placemat.<br/>
<br/>
   Accuracy is still the question with maps since they often change <br/>
trail routes this time of year to go around obstacles such as washed <br/>
out foot bridges they don't wish to replace.  Deer creek had that issue <br/>
  with bridges rotting away and large tracts in Zaleski State forest are <br/>
cut for timber frequently.   I was scoping out a couple remote favorite <br/>
places Saturday and found one barren of trees and the other under <br/>
Beaver ponds.  Ohio, like many other states mulled over the idea of <br/>
charging folks to park at places we've financed already and reap the <br/>
money from timber sales from 'public' lands.<br/>
<br/>
  The latter being the rant of the day.<br/>

Hi Doug<br/>
<br/>
Prior to many river suppliers selling waterproof maps there was only <br/>
Aqua Seal or similar products. I was too cheap to purchase the stuff <br/>
and coated many of my non-water proof maps with varnish. That worked <br/>
for a while but I do not recommend it. I would think the clear <br/>
contact paper might be better than Aqua Seal. You might contact <br/>
North West River supplies in Moscow, Idaho, or some other river <br/>
supplier for info.<br/>
