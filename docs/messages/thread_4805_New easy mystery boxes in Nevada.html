Since most of our time on our recent desert hiking trip was spent in <br/>
Death Valley National Park and Mojave National Preserve, and we <br/>
really did not want to risk leaving any boxes in places with the word <br/>
national in their names, we decided we"d be better off hurriedly <br/>
depositing them on our drive back to the Las Vegas airport yesterday! <br/>
They may not be in the greatest of spots, but at least we hope they <br/>
will be safe for a while, and that anyone traveling to that area <br/>
might be able to check on them for us sometime!<br/>
<br/>
They are the DESERT DUO: "Desert Tortoise" and "Ojito de la Tortuga" <br/>
(aka "Heart of the Desert"). The latter was originally planned <br/>
as "Calico Honeymoon 2", to be left at either Calico Ghost Town in CA <br/>
or near Calico Tank in the Calico Hills west of Las Vegas, but since <br/>
we ran out of time before getting to either of those places, we just <br/>
had to make do with a quick and easy name change for a quick and easy <br/>
letterbox! (less than 2 minutes as compared to less than 2 hours!)<br/>
Additional hints will probably not be needed, but we will gladly <br/>
supply them to prevent months and months of fruitless searching! <br/>
Clues are #26 and #27 on our webpage. (I think Pete has it already <br/>
done, but he will have to update the link himself!) Have fun !<br/>
