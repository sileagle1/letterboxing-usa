It had had a nice trip with Jay and the rest of the Drew clan until <br/>
it came to rest at Tribal Nations, where I found it. I took it to a <br/>
few places around here in my local area but couldn't find a box to <br/>
fit it in, (most folks using a sandwich size box)which is just big <br/>
enough, as you all know to hold a small journal, inkpad, stamp, and <br/>
pencil or pen. Well, yesterday I packed up Palantir in his (her) (I'm <br/>
not sure what would be politically correct here) own little container <br/>
and went to another favorite place of mine. I placed it with a host <br/>
that has seen and kept it's share of hitchhikers in it's lifetime to <br/>
date. I've found two there so far. This info alone, with a little <br/>
detective work should give sufficient clues as to it's whereabouts <br/>
for those who love to find hitchhikers. If any of you are thinking of <br/>
going out to retrieve the Palantir, use extreme caution. The trail is <br/>
very icy. Leave the kids at home. Be safe.<br/>
<br/>
Since no one has visited this spot since Columbus Day weekend, I'll <br/>
leave Palantir there for a week or two, and then transfer it to <br/>
another place where it's more likely to be found. If any one finds it <br/>
in the meantime, a note would be very much appreciated. I wouldn't <br/>
want to negotiate that ice again for nothing.<br/>
