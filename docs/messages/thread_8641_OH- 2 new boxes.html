carry up to 1/3 of its weight in a balanced pack that is positioned over 
it's shoulders = 12 steps</div>

<div><strong>HAPPY DOG BOX #3</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Placed 10-23-02 by SCOUTDOGS</div>
<div>Hamilton County near Hamilton Ohio</div>
<div>Miami White Water Forest</div>
<div>See directions for Box #1 &amp; #2</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is a bonus (no questions to answer :-)</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>After box #2 is securely back in it's hiding place, 
go back to the bench &amp; continue down the main trail. You will pass by 
"Shallow Beginnings" &amp; may be able to increase your 'lizard' count :-) 
Continue on to cross the long boardwalk. At the end of the board walk, count 2 
waterbars. From the second waterbar, go 25 steps. See a tree on your left 
that had 4 trunks? At the very edge of the trail in front of this tree is a 
triangular shaped rock. What you seek is under this rock. Since this is on the 
trail, be discrete &amp; move away from the spot to stamp in, then re-hide well. 
Continue on the trail to get back to your car. </div>
