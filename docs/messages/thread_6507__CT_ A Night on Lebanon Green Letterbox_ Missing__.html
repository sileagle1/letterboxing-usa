I didn't get out to pick the box up over the weekend  please if <br/>
someone else did to  dry it and clean it let us know. It has gone <br/>
missing once before and I will replace it at some point if we don't <br/>
hear from anyone. Sorry for the  empty trip and  thanks to Chuck for <br/>
the heads up on it wish the weekend hadn't been so busy.  Leader of <br/>
the Pack<br/>
