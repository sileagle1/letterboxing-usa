it seems like The Skyline is a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't <br/>
want to box there.  Too bad, I was planning another trip down there to <br/>
search for some boxes.  However, he did say the views were many and <br/>
breathtaking.  But, it seems like you should pack up the car and drive <br/>
it and make a few stops here and there.  I've heard the boxing in <br/>
Reston is pretty good.....oh....and be sure to check out Luray <br/>
Caverns. <br/>

Have a great trip and sorry to be the bearer of bad news,<br/>

If we let ourselves get disappointed by every geocache that had<br/>
nothing but McToys in it, or was a bison tube hanging in a tree two<br/>
miles down the trail, or every DNF, we'd never go caching again. <br/>
Obviously, with nearly 2,000 finds, we don't let such things bother us<br/>
too much.  The box (geocache or LB) is not the reward; the reward is<br/>
the hike to it, and the views, and the birds and flowers seen along<br/>
the way, and all that stuff.  The LB is merely validation that we made<br/>
it, and the stamp in our book is just a way to remind us of the trip.<br/>
 Granted, missing and damaged boxes are a PitA, but that's been part<br/>
of this hobby for decades.  I've railed against the laissez-faire<br/>
attitude of some boxers, and been told, sometimes gently and sometimes<br/>
not, to hush up and let every boxer handle such things as they see<br/>
fit.  Maybe if enough people with that attitude had enough trouble<br/>
finding other people's missing or damaged LBs, the problem would start<br/>
to be fixed.  Until then, the "official" policy is pretty much, "Every<br/>
boxer can decide for him/herself how to take care of their hides, or<br/>
even *if* they will take care of them."  Not very environmental, but<br/>
that's how it is.<br/>

I'm not disappointed, I've never been to form an opinion.  Before blowing my knee out, I would go as hard as anyone else. (Except , for Mark Pepe, and TGD.  Those folks are out of their minds.  Am I right, Sue?)  The reason for my post was to let the people who were going there know about the length and difficulty of the hikes.  They are going with their family I believe.  I'm assuming they wouldn't want to take a younger child on a 12 mile hike.  That's all.     Hold on, hold on...you are a geocacher....  Who let you in here?  Why am I even discussing this with you?  Did someone teach this person the secret handshake?  <br/>
<br/>
However, I do thank you for your concern about my letterboxing philosophy and practices. <br/>

&gt; I know I'm new here, but this is, after all, "goal oriented" <br/>
walking isn't it? I don't see there being anything wrong with <br/>
expecting a great stamp after trekking all day for the thing. Clues <br/>
are here nor there for me, but I do appreciate a killer stamp after <br/>
a killer walk. Just a thought from a newbie (on this list)<br/>

&gt; I'm not sure I get the reason for your disappointment...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sure, a nice stamp would be great, but the hike is the point, <br/>
IMHO. <br/>
&gt; If we let ourselves get disappointed by every geocache that had<br/>
&gt; nothing but McToys in it, or was a bison tube hanging in a tree <br/>
two<br/>
&gt; miles down the trail, or every DNF, we'd never go caching again. <br/>
&gt; Obviously, with nearly 2,000 finds, we don't let such things <br/>
bother us<br/>
&gt; too much. The box (geocache or LB) is not the reward; the <br/>
reward is<br/>
&gt; the hike to it, and the views, and the birds and flowers seen <br/>
along<br/>
&gt; the way, and all that stuff. The LB is merely validation that <br/>
we made<br/>
&gt; it, and the stamp in our book is just a way to remind us of the <br/>
trip.<br/>
&gt; Granted, missing and damaged boxes are a PitA, but that's been <br/>
part<br/>
&gt; of this hobby for decades. I've railed against the laissez-faire<br/>
&gt; attitude of some boxers, and been told, sometimes gently and <br/>
sometimes<br/>
&gt; not, to hush up and let every boxer handle such things as they <br/>
see<br/>
&gt; fit. Maybe if enough people with that attitude had enough <br/>
trouble<br/>
&gt; finding other people's missing or damaged LBs, the problem would <br/>
start<br/>
&gt; to be fixed. Until then, the "official" policy is pretty <br/>
much, "Every<br/>
&gt; boxer can decide for him/herself how to take care of their <br/>
hides, or<br/>
&gt; even *if* they will take care of them." Not very environmental, <br/>
but<br/>
&gt; that's how it is.<br/>
