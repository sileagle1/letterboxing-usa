<br/>
We're new to letterboxing... and new to Michigan after moving here from <br/>
Lancaster, PA this past February. We look forward to both finding <br/>
letterboxes in SE Michigan, and also planting some of our own!<br/>
<br/>
Question for you all: Are there lots of websites for letterboxing <br/>
clues... or is it just the one at "LBNA?"  The recent Time article on <br/>
letterboxing  <all <br="" certainly="" giving="" is="" lb="" lots="" of="" press="" recently="" this="">
coverage and no doubt tons more devotees, eh?!?!?&gt;  stated that "more <br/>
than 9,000 letterboxes" have been planted around the country. Are there <br/>
that many on the LbNA site?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and happy hunting everyone!<br/>

Good question.  Well the LBNA is certainly one of the best &amp; most <br/>
comprehensive sites for clues it is NOT the end of the road for <br/>
clues.  There are boxes that contain clues to other boxes.  There <br/>
are clues that are only passed by word of mouth (WOM).  There are <br/>
clues that you must earn by collecting x number of boxes.  There are <br/>
other sites where people post their own clues &amp; do not bother with <br/>
LBNA.  There are even clues that bounce from box to box- like hitch <br/>
hiking stamps.  Search the web, join the group, follow the links &amp; <br/>
eventually you too will have 30 pages bookmarked in your web browser <br/>
pertaining to letterboxing.  But start with LBNA because it's a <br/>
great place to start.  Do a yahoo or google search to look a little <br/>
deeper &amp; let the fun begin!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting!<br/>

I strongly suggest you check out Atlast Quest and when in Maine, "Letterboxing in <br/>
Maine"  - and there are of course, the unmentionables, the clues that are not on the <br/>
internet - ANYWHERE - the "word of mouth" (WOM) clues. <br/>

In the words of T.Cooch, "the game is afoot" so keep on your toes!<br/>
