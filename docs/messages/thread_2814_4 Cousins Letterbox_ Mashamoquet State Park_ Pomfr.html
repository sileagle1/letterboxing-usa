We entered the park for a day of FUN. Fishing gear, swim stuff, <br/>
letterboxing , hiking and a picnic lunch all to be followed by We -<br/>
Like-It ice cream ( Rte 97 Abington - outrageously good! ).<br/>
<br/>
There is a park fee or follow clues to Camera and Film for a no fee <br/>
parking area, we bagged that box and table rock. When you come in to <br/>
the park for Camera and Film you could cross bridge and do  4 <br/>
Cousins. ( Bathrooms here)  Pass the swimming pond to the big field. <br/>
On the Northeast side of the field look for a large tree hanging over <br/>
the field stretching for sunlight. From the base of that tree take 10 <br/>
paces away from the pond along the edge of the field. Now turn and <br/>
face the woods. Go straight up the slope to pose on a large rock. <br/>
View another rock at 100 gegrees &amp; 10 paces. At that rock take a <br/>
reading of 60 degrees ,uphill it will be. At the end of a dead tree  <br/>
under a living tree is the 4 Cousins letterbox. It is nestled into a <br/>
squirrels storage place. Please stamp and rehide exactly so others <br/>
may enjoy the search. Have Fun!<br/>
