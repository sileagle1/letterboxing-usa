<br/>
Back from a visit to Minneapolis, Minnesota over the holidays and placed a new letterbox there. I'm <br/>
not sure if the two letterboxes on Pike Island are still there (some earlier posts seemed to indicate <br/>
they were washed away by spring flooding) but my letterbox is located not too far from there. Here <br/>
are the clues:<br/>
<br/>
Rock of Racial Harmony Letterbox<br/>
Minneapolis, Hennepin County, Minnesota<br/>
<br/>
The Rock of Racial Harmony is an immense boulder on the edge of a meadow atop a cliff overlooking <br/>
the Mississippi River. To find the Rock, start from the trailhead at 54th Street. Follow the bike path <br/>
southward toward Fort Snelling, but shortly you will come to a gravel road leading down toward the <br/>
river. Follow the road, taking the left branch past the electrical tower and around the meadow. The <br/>
Rock is located on the far side of the meadow.<br/>
