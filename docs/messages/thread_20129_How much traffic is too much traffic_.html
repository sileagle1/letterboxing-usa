This wouldn't happen to be one of the Johnny Appleseed<br/>
Series, would it? Anyway...I think the general idea is<br/>
that when a very pronounced social trail develops,<br/>
it's probably a pretty good idea for the placer to<br/>
consider re-hiding the box. Of course, it's up to the<br/>
placer to make this decision...<br/>

No, I wasn't thinking of that series.  I am thinking of Independence Day at Fort Harrison <br/>
State Park.  I know you visited recently ... did you happen to find my hostel?  If not, you'll <br/>
have to come back.  I planted another series further south.  I stayed away from the Fort <br/>
this weekend because I knew of the races.  Thanks for your input and I am coming to find <br/>
your boxes later this fall!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would say that you shouldn't hide the box that far off the trail <br/>
where a "path" can be visibly trodden to the box.  I have boxes that <br/>
have survived in the wild for over 3 years and I have boxes that went <br/>
missing after being out in the wild for 2 weeks. If a path is being <br/>
beaten to the "doorstep" of the letterbox, it is more likely to be <br/>
found accidentally by folks who are not appreciative of this hobby. <br/>
And the box might not survive long anyway.<br/>
<br/>
What also happens, is a box is hidden in the winter and when Spring <br/>
and Summer arrive there is more vegetation than the planter had <br/>
originally thought! Lots of boxes in the Pacific Northwest become <br/>
overrun with blackberries and stinging nettles. Boxes in the South <br/>
might encounter kudzu. :-) A Good Letterbox Planter tries to think <br/>
about these possible future problems when looking for a hiding place.<br/>
