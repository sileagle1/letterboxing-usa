be hiking the Appalachian Trail next year, to raise awareness and <br/>
money for Lyme Disease research.  In learning more about the trail, <br/>
and the challenges hiking it presents, I got to thinking: What about <br/>
placing special letterboxes along the trail, with clues published <br/>
mainly on Web sites that thru-hikers would read?  <br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking this would add some mystery and fun to the long trek, <br/>
especially in the desolate sections.  Maybe the boxes would be of the <br/>
take-an-item, leave-an-item nature, rather than stamping, since <br/>
thru-hikers might not want the extra weight of a stamp and a logbook.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, there would be a stamp and logbook in the letterbox<br/>
itself, to keep a record of who passes through.  And definitely <br/>
postcards!<br/>
<br/>
This is just the beginning of an idea.  Part of the Appalachian Trail <br/>
runs through my state (Connecticut), and as of right now, there are<br/>
no letterboxes listed in that part of the state.  I'd love to be the <br/>
first to place one on the AT in Connecticut, but it would be even <br/>
better if letterboxers who live near the trail in other states could <br/>
participate.  Maybe we could even get thru-hikers to post clues in<br/>
the shelters along the trail, or to pass them on by word-of-mouth to <br/>
hikers going the opposite way? <br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts on this idea?<br/>

Sounds like a good idea to me.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if you know about http://www.letterboxing.org/series.html<br/>
which lists current boxes on the AT (I'm no longer maintaining this<br/>
list, and I'm not sure if its up to date, (someone else may know), but<br/>
you are welcome to it to adapt as you see fit if you want).<br/>
<br/>
(The state first list on this page is definitely out of date; I am <br/>
still maintaining that elsewhere at <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/states.html and will update KY when the <br/>
clue is listed).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Part of the Appalachian Trail runs through my state (Connecticut), <br/>

<br/>
I'm glad you used the word "listed" ;-)<br/>
