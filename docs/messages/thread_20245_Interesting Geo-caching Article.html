 I like letterboxing , and geocaching, so don't run down caching . Some people like finding more then a stamp. Don't you get me wrong the stamps are a work of art. And they took a long time to carve. I love seeing all the different stamps. But letterboxing people leave trails too. How are you to get there but by trail. I don't think rangers should remove the caching boxes or letter boxes it is a sport. moose leave trails also.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; letterboxing people leave trails too. How are you to get there but<br/>
&gt; by trail.<br/>
<br/>
You can hide a letterbox along a well-maintained trail that allows <br/>
people to find the box without creating new trails, and every <br/>
letterboxer that plants a box should strive for such 'environmentally <br/>
sound' letterboxing practices.<br/>
<br/>
Taken right from the FAQ on letterboxing.org:<br/>
<br/>
Respect the land when hunting boxes and when hiding them. Don't place <br/>
a box that requires people to tramp through sensitive wildlife or <br/>
plant habitat to find it, for example.<br/>
<br/>
We're not setting a double standard for geocachers.  Letterboxers <br/>
should not be hiding letterboxes in places that create new trails, <br/>
though sadly, some irresponsible boxes do just this.  It's a problem.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; moose leave trails also.<br/>
<br/>
A moose craps wherever it wants to as well, but it doesn't mean <br/>
people should be crapping on the sidewalks all over town.  That's a <br/>
weak argument for two reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1. People outnumber moose by a LARGE margin, and thus are capable of <br/>
causing far more environmental damage than a moose could, or even <br/>
several moose.<br/>
<br/>
2. Hiding a letterbox or geocache causes an abnormally large number <br/>
of people to focus on a single illegally trampled trail.  Moose, on <br/>
the other hand, all aren't focused on the same, single goal like <br/>
people are.  They'll wander where they want to go--they don't follow <br/>
directions that lead them all onto the same trampled trails.<br/>
<br/>
If we, as letterboxers, don't want to be banned from hiding boxes <br/>
everywhere, we have to show responsible hiding--which means NOT <br/>
putting boxes in locations that would cause environmental damage <br/>
around it.<br/>
