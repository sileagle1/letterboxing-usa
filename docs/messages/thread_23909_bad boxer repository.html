<br/>
Also - this is the 4th box gone missing of 8.  In one month.  I vented.<br/>
 Then (since I'm a problem-solver by nature) I tried to think up a<br/>
solution, or at least a way of sharing info.<br/>
<br/>
If I suspect someone is actively boxing and not hiding things properly,<br/>
I probably will "narc" on them to other placers via AQ.  Just kind of a<br/>
heads-up "you might want to check this box" kind of thing.<br/>
