I don't mind if I find a box with a store bought stamp in it. I like the thrill of the hunt. It's just not the same going to a store and buying the stamps to stamp into your log book. The store doesn't seem to hide them really well! ;) <br/>

I could say the same about a few letterboxers out there, but I still <br/>
go out and look for their stamps.  ;o)<br/>

I have been meaning to email you, we went to the "sunrise key" box and what a blast it was finding it! VERY CLEVER!! Hope you are not disappointed that my stamp is currently a store one, As I explained to the young lady who was "disappointed" my husband and I just got started and I travel about 16 days out of the month, work about 65 hrs a week and the golly gee the airlines frowns on exacto knives on planes and i haven't had the time to carve but i have fun no matter what!<br/>
