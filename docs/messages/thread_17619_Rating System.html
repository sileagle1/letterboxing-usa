<br/>
I am the one in my family that is really into letterboxing.  The rest of my family is only so-so on doing it.  They will do it if I am, but only for so long.  If I am out boxing by myself, I could care less what the difficulty is.  If I spend and hour walking up and down a section of trail looking for something, that's not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
However, when I on a family trip and we have a limited amount of time, I would like to have some idea of what I am getting into before I stop to look for a box.  My poor family can only handle standing in the same spot for so long while I try to determine which of the 500 rocks around me looks like President Lincoln's nose.<br/>
<br/>
I equate them having to stand around being like myself standing in a clothing store while my wife tries on what seems to be every outfit in the store.  She loves to do that but I am bored out of my skull.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I like seeing a rating system that I can use to gauge whether or not this should be one that I can find quickly or one that I should pass up for the sake of my marriage and family unity while on vacation.  : )<br/>
