gather under the pines in Mansfield. Carol , Leader of the Pack as usual <br/>
did a great job,  the Event stamp is beautiful , worth a drive from <br/>
anywhere !<br/>
Lenny and Dan tried unsuccessfully to fool me by presenting me with my <br/>
lost hiking stick --WRONG --stick.  I am still in awe that Dan was able <br/>
to find it.  As Lenny said, " Not really a problem, the forest is only <br/>
750 acres, so finding your stick was no big deal !"  They became such <br/>
heroes and all over a stick.  Thanks guys for finding it and it was <br/>
wonderful getting it back.  NOw the image of it is out there traveling <br/>
as a H.H.  hope it does not get lost !<br/>
Chuck, your Safari , North was so enjoyable. Music Woman and I had the <br/>
excitement of  finding the boxes and getting out of the woods before the <br/>
rain came. I passed Pete coming out of the Safari  South, so he made it <br/>
out too.  We missed you Wanda ., but you can't be in two places at once. <br/>
I fell in love with the African Elephant, he is sooo cute. Good job of <br/>
carving all .  I can hardly wait to find the Safari South ones with <br/>
Bluebird soon.<br/>
Happy boxing,  Butterfly<br/>
