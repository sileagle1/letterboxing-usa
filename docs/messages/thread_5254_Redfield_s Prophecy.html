Durham, NC<br/>
Insight Number One: A Critical Mass<br/>
<br/>
Although I don't agree, entirely, with his idealistic approach to finding<br/>
meaning in love and, in turn in life, I have adopted Redfield's Prophecy as<br/>
an outline to this adventure series.  Along the way, I hope to offer some<br/>
sort of outside-insight to your current situation. Perhaps it will be the<br/>
simple realization that it helps to leave work at home for a while and play<br/>
beside your worries, or maybe there is a much more meaningful message for<br/>
you to discover. Either way, we all benefit from letterboxing. Enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
Most of us would much rather be There. I have come to believe that there is<br/>
always a reason for Here. If you are a traveler, as am I, you have adopted<br/>
the third of the three wants, which will never be satisfied. Be that as it<br/>
may, my quest began in the vicinity of Durham, NC. It is there in the<br/>
University's Gardens, that this adventure begins for you. <br/>
<br/>
Because the first box is not on challenging terrain, please take advantage<br/>
of the scenery once you have completed today's hunt. Before you arrive, you<br/>
may want to read up on the Garden's Mission. If you reside in the Triangle<br/>
Area, it would truly be a shame to leave without visiting. <br/>
<br/>
The Clue:<br/>
<br/>
The first box may be found among the collection of southeastern wildflowers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As you walk, imagine you are with your elderly Grandmother. You try to make<br/>
small talk, but you are worried for her safety, that she will slip and break<br/>
her hip. Eventually you come to a small footbridge with a sharp incline, you<br/>
panic because you know Grandmother will not make it over without your help.<br/>
You will find the first bit of insight beneath the panic bridge. Good luck!<br/>
