We're placing the Snow Dogs Series today in Tacoma Wa and will have the clues up and running by this evening. This is a series of 8 to 10 boxes in a place that is untouched with other boxes currently.  (Though there are two geochaches in there).<br/>
<br/>
The Snow Dogs Series is based on the Disney movie and is a series of hand carved stamps (Our second attempt at carving, as RayvenDad completed and released the 'Hitchhiker Dude' and the 'HitchBiker Dude' last week.  RayvenMom carved these stamps.)<br/>
<br/>
We hope everyone enjoys these as much as we did placing and creating them.<br/>
