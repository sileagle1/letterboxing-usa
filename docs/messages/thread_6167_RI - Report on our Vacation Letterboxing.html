<br/>
I thought I would let those of you who are interested know how we did <br/>
with our Rhode Island boxes.<br/>
<br/>
6/23 Asa Pond - We found only the second one.  Really fun trail for <br/>
the kids with all the little bridges.<br/>
<br/>
6/23 Fast Track To Your Degree - we found only the first one, tried <br/>
for all three.  Beautiful campus.<br/>
<br/>
6/25 Signs of Life - We found 3 but had to leave to meet someone for <br/>
lunch before we found the 4th.  There were lots of ticks and scratchy <br/>
plants!<br/>
<br/>
6/25 Dolphins at Daybreak - What a beautiful place!  Found the box.<br/>
<br/>
6/25 Midnight on the Moon - Yes, the poison ivy is unbelievable!  We <br/>
didn't go far enough along the trail last time we tried.  We found it <br/>
successfully this time.<br/>
<br/>
6/26  Southeast Lighthouse on Block Island - Letterbox still intact.  <br/>
We took the tour of the lighthouse, well worth the $5 for adults.  <br/>
Got to take the circular stairs all the way to the top of the <br/>
lighthouse and see the light up close and the view.  It was great and <br/>
well worth the walk.  We look forward to going to Block Island again.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a bunch of great boxes!  It sure broadens our experience <br/>
while we are on vacation.<br/>
