<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a lot of fun, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I too box with my children (sometimes; other times I like to get out on my<br/>
own).  My kids are 8, 6, and 3.  We actually started two years ago, so it<br/>
has been fun to watch their interests change in regards to boxing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I hope you don't think this is  too presumptuous but I am going to tell<br/>
you a few things about letterboxing with kids that I wish I had known at the<br/>
very beginning.  Some may seem obvious. But I have learned over the last<br/>
several years that not everyone sees the obvious.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, younger kids are not always great at "discreet" so you usually have<br/>
to work a lot hard to be inconspicuous while boxing.  We practice a lot and<br/>
talk about different scenarios.  The plus side is that kids are great<br/>
cover-no one thinks too much of a  youngster off the path (especially if you<br/>
give them a bug catcher!).  My older two are pretty good at subterfuge by<br/>
this point-especially the  6 yo.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, do no allow your children to retrieve, open or rehide the boxes<br/>
without  good supervision.  Yes, they love it.  Yes, this is the fun part,<br/>
but  boxes are easily ruined if not repackaged correctly and go missing when<br/>
not rehidden properly.  I do allow my kids to retrieve boxes-after I have<br/>
scouted the area and know exactly where and how the box was placed.  I do<br/>
allow them to rehide the boxes-and I check behind them to insure the box is<br/>
well concealed.  Occasionally, I allow them to open the boxes, again, only<br/>
if I am watching and paying attention to how the stamp and logbook were<br/>
packed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, be cautious with food on the trail and using baby wipes.  Both can<br/>
leave odors on the box that will attract critters (yes, even the unscented<br/>
wipes.  Go figure)  I was bummed to learn this-peanut butter crackers and<br/>
baby wipes were staples in my pack during the early boxes.  Now we save the<br/>
snacks for the playground AFTER we find the box.  Works well for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help your kids learn to be respectful boxers and you  will have a hobby to<br/>
share for the rest of your lives!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy..<br/>
