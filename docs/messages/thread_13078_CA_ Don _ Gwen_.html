We found your Wild Goose letterbox near Willows, CA last week and it <br/>
was doing well.  We noticed on our return trip through the area <br/>
(yesterday) that they have now added exit numbers to the highway <br/>
signs (at least throughout Northern California so far).<br/>
<br/>
The preferred exit for this letterbox is I-5, Exit 595 <br/>
(Princeton/Road 68).  The sign just before the offramp says: Road <br/>
68/Exit 595.  I think the directions on the clues say something <br/>
like 'take exit 68' which is incorrect/confusing.  Hope this helps <br/>
clear any confusion that might arise for future letterboxers who <br/>
visit this box.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a great letterbox!  You folks are incredibly gifted <br/>
carvers!!!  We saw some awesome birds during this trip, too.<br/>
