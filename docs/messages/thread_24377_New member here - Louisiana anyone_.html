&gt;Hi guys! I'm new here and just digging into this awesome thing called<br/>
&gt;letterboxing! My husband and I are planning a roadtrip around<br/>
&gt;louisiana to find some of the boxes that have been planted in our<br/>
&gt;area. We are also hoping to plant some of our own during our trip!<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to rain on your parade, but before you get too far along <br/>
in your planning, most letterboxers would recommend that you find a <br/>
20 or 30 or 40 or 50 letterboxes -- and try but fail to find a few <br/>
more -- before you start planting your own. Even if you read as much <br/>
as you can about letterboxing, it's really hard for many beginners to <br/>
grasp the nuances of what makes a good hiding place, the importance <br/>
of using quality waterproof containers and baggies, how nice it is to <br/>
find a hand-crafted journal and hand-carved stamp in a letterbox, how <br/>
frustrating it is to try to find a letterbox with poorly-written <br/>
clues, how very satisfying it is to find a mystery box. All these <br/>
things you'll only learn as you letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you enjoy letterboxing.<br/>
