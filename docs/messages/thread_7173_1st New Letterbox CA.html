                    <div class="plaintext-content">On August 21, 2002 Funhog placed the Mountain View Letterbox near the town<br/>
of Mt. Shasta, Shasta County, California. If you need to stretch your legs<br/>
while driving I-5, this is the perfect place to do it. The trail is only<br/>
ten minutes from the freeway but a world apart in terms of atmosphere. The<br/>
box may be inaccessible during the winter months. The view of the mountain<br/>
from the letterbox is filtered through the trees but all along the highway<br/>
you will be treated its breathtaking glory.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: from the stoplight at E. Lake and Mt. Shasta Blvd. in the<br/>
center of town, head uphill on E. Lake which will become the Everitt<br/>
Memorial Highway (A-10.) About five miles past the high school (Go Bears!)<br/>
you will come to the McBride Springs Campground. A quarter mile beyond this<br/>
point, at mile marker 4, park on the right side in a large turnout.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: Cross the road and head up the trail. Just when you can<br/>
no longer see the road over your shoulder you will come to a small clearing<br/>
with four tall Ponderosa pines and a stump. About 150 steps further up the<br/>
path veer left between two sawn logs. Cross a rocky stream bed (dry in<br/>
August.) Just before the trail makes a right turn you will meet a baby<br/>
cedar, a ponderous neighbor guarding its back and a row of stone-faced<br/>
nursemaids protecting its front. The largest of the nannies has a second<br/>
charge in its safekeeping: the letterbox.<br/>
