                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently found and gathered up a hitchhiker called NEXT by dregan &amp; <br/>
BRI [I think of Pennsylvania].  It was originally released in 2003, <br/>
but was at someone's house for a year [broken leg] and then sat in the <br/>
box we found it for a year [3 finders stamped in, but no one moved it].<br/>
<br/>
It's not listed at either major site, and the email in the log seems <br/>
stale.  I would like to be able to contact the placer before planting <br/>
it again, in case they would rather have it back at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know him/her and have more recent contact info?  <br/>
<br/>
Would you go ahead and drop it off in a box anyway?<br/>

placer, and you might also join the regional list that includes Pennsylvania<br/>
and post looking for dregan there.  Give them a little time to reach you or<br/>
for someone to dig up contact information for them.  If you still haven't<br/>
heard anything, I would just keep it moving.  As long as there is room in<br/>
the logbook, there really isn't a reason to slow it down waiting for contact<br/>
from the owner!<br/>
