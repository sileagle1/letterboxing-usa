                    <div class="plaintext-content">Been a long time since the Early Bird clan went boxing, and sadly, we had no luck on this one.  All five boxes are gone.  We are certain we had the right spots for boxes 1, 4 and 5, and 90% sure on boxes 2 and 3.  I'd guess the park removed them.  "It's a PRESERVE, sir!" as one ranger snarked at me a couple years back when she caught me letting the younger birds climb a tree.<br/>
