I am new to letterboxing, so I have not yet attended an event.  If I ever do, I am sure it will have to be only a close one.  I am not a very social person, and going to an event where I don't know anyone would be a bit uncomfortable for me. <br/>

I've been to a few events over the past two years, and I've enjoyed all of them for different reasons.  Sometimes when I'm with my daughter I end up worrying about her and don't get to do things that I would have liked to do otherwise.  So I REALLY enjoyed Tune In/Toon Out this year, since I went with a friend instead :-)  But my daughter is coming this weekend, and I know we'll have an awesome time! <br/>

I have to admit I do enjoy the occasional flame. I've been flamed a few times. Once as a newbie and really got my feelings hurt. Now I don't take it personally.<br/>
I also despise the AQ lists(sorry Ryan) . Too clunky to navigate for me, way too many of them and most not really related to Letterboxing.<br/>
So there, that's my 2 cents.<br/>
OT, Nathan have you read Malcolm Gladwell's book, Blink. You might want to get rid of your tag line about women and eye rolling. I think I'll leave it there and see what kind of responses I get.<br/>

I don't care if there is a ToTW (Topic of the Week), we still have them<br/>
occasionally on our regional board whenever the whim strikes someone.<br/>
Individuals answer if they feel like adding to the conversation, and ignore<br/>
if it doesn't interest them.<br/>

I had to laugh about your comment on the AQ lists!  I tend to agree and<br/>
prefer the Yahoo groups.  It's too bad some of them have withered away.  The<br/>
funny thing is, the feeling is mutual.  The Big Green Turtle recently posted<br/>
on his blog that he "absolutely loathed the Yahoo Groups" (JUN 24).<br/>

--The big list, why do I still read it? Well I like the fact it's boxers<br/>
from all over not just my cozy little corner of the Mid-Atlantic. Over the<br/>
years I've met quite a few and it's nice to see their name on a post and<br/>
feel connected.<br/>
I have to admit I do enjoy the occasional flame. I've been flamed a few<br/>
times. Once as a newbie and really got my feelings hurt. Now I don't take it<br/>
personally.<br/>
I also despise the AQ lists(sorry Ryan) . Too clunky to navigate for me, way<br/>
too many of them and most not really related to Letterboxing.<br/>
So there, that's my 2 cents.<br/>
OT, Nathan have you read Malcolm Gladwell's book, Blink. You might want to<br/>
get rid of your tag line about women and eye rolling. I think I'll leave it<br/>
there and see what kind of responses I get.<br/>

So are we having two questions of the week now? Brian TeamGreenDragon<br/>
&gt; So THAT being said it is again Wednesday and here it 'tis the much awaited<br/>
&gt; for Humpday Question of the Week:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do you attend letterboxing events? What has been your favorite letterboxing<br/>
&gt; event to date?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>

I guess my real question is are we going to all go along with having some trivial question of the week like "do you enjoy going to gatherings?" or are we going to have controversial questions asked?<br/>
Like Nathan did, What is the future/reason for this list even to exist? The newboxers list now has more members than this one. Kinda sad if you ask me, considering the reasoning behind the Newboxer's list was for people to get their feet wet before leaving there and coming over here to participate in the grown up conversations. I'd like to ask questions like: Why has the the general population just excepted that one person making a profit off of our game been allowed to decide the future of what letterboxing is and will become? (I know this isn't really fair to ask right now, because that person is on vacation in Spain at the moment). Why did online logging of found boxes become the norm after so many fought so hard against this very thing? Why did the public displaying of other peoples work become acceptable? Why do people feel the need to know who they might or might not meet at a gathering they are going to attend? Should you be able to easily print out a list of PT's that will be at a gathering,(I always thought that a PT clue should need to be be figured out before even knowing it was a PT clue.) again, it just seems to take away from the whole spirit of the game. I think it is time for some of us to stand up and take back the game we found and fell in love with.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think this one of Briann's points. The idea fof the PT has become diluted. It seem s everyone had 2 or 3. But it's your PT you can do what ever you want with it. Yes, there will always be the letterbox police who want you to do it their way, but so what.<br/>
I ,frankly was kinda tired of the whole PT thing, it's just another stamp. Yes sometimes really great art work. But I'm such a hypocrit, I have a fairly new PT, Box Slut. But most people don't really seem to get it(, no Brian I don't want sex in the woods.) The clue asks you to give something up. I'm trying to be a little more picky about what that something is, but I'm a box slut so I give it up anyway. I just can't help myself.<br/>

&gt; ...speaking of PT's...I have oh, so many questions.  Thought I had been<br/>

...speaking of PT's...I have oh, so many questions. Thought I had been <br/>
playing this game long enough - but maybe not.I was reading something just <br/>
the other night, where the boxer was upset because someone gave out their PT <br/>
"too easily". <br/>
I have one PT that you can just ask for, and one that you have to figure <br/>
something out. I made it knowing full well that not a lot of people would <br/>
"get it". And I'm fine with that - so if somebody makes a concerted effort, <br/>
but can't solve it - I'm apt to give it anyway. <br/>
I know there are boxers that absolutely won't give out their PT until you do <br/>
the correct thing. I'm happy with that, too. <br/>
<br/>
I'm just curious - if you have a PT - are you a stickler for the absolute? <br/>
Or more apt to be with the "free love" society?? <br/>
I'm kind of curious to see where most boxers land. <br/>

&gt; I guess my real question is are we going to all go along with having some <br/>

&gt; we going to have controversial questions asked? <br/>

&gt; considering the reasoning behind the Newboxer's list was for people to get <br/>
&gt; their feet wet before leaving there and coming over here to participate in <br/>
&gt; the grown up conversations. I'd like to ask questions like: Why has the the <br/>
&gt; general population just excepted that one person making a profit off of our <br/>
&gt; game been allowed to decide the future of what letterboxing is and will <br/>
&gt; become? (I know this isn't really fair to ask right now, because that person <br/>
&gt; is on vacation in Spain at the moment). Why did online logging of found <br/>
&gt; boxes become the norm after so many fought so hard against this very thing? <br/>
&gt; Why did the public displaying of other peoples work become acceptable? Why <br/>
&gt; do people feel the need to know who they might or might not meet at a <br/>
&gt; gathering they are going to attend? Should you be able to easily print out a <br/>
&gt; list of PT's that will be at a gathering,(I always thought that a PT clue <br/>
&gt; should need to be be figured out before even knowing it was a PT clue.) <br/>
&gt; again, it just seems to take away from the whole spirit of the game. I think <br/>
&gt; it is time for some of us to stand up and take back the game we found and <br/>
&gt; fell in love with. <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, and you can keep those two questions, or trade for the one<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess my real question is are we going to all go along with having<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trivial question of the week like "do you enjoy going to<br/>
&gt; gatherings?" or are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we going to have controversial questions asked?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Like Nathan did, What is the future/reason for this list even to<br/>
&gt; exist? The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; newboxers list now has more members than this one. Kinda sad if you<br/>
&gt; ask me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; considering the reasoning behind the Newboxer's list was for people<br/>
&gt; to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their feet wet before leaving there and coming over here to<br/>
&gt; participate in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the grown up conversations. I'd like to ask questions like: Why has<br/>
&gt; the the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; general population just excepted that one person making a profit off<br/>
&gt; of our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; game been allowed to decide the future of what letterboxing is and<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; become? (I know this isn't really fair to ask right now, because<br/>
&gt; that person<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is on vacation in Spain at the moment). Why did online logging of<br/>
&gt; found<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes become the norm after so many fought so hard against this very<br/>
&gt; thing?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Why did the public displaying of other peoples work become<br/>
&gt; acceptable? Why<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do people feel the need to know who they might or might not meet at<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering they are going to attend? Should you be able to easily<br/>
&gt; print out a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; list of PT's that will be at a gathering,(I always thought that a PT<br/>
&gt; clue<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; should need to be be figured out before even knowing it was a PT<br/>
&gt; clue.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; again, it just seems to take away from the whole spirit of the game.<br/>
&gt; I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it is time for some of us to stand up and take back the game we<br/>
&gt; found and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fell in love with.<br/>

Not all Letterboxes are for everyones consumption and the same can be said for Letterboxing sites.<br/>
<br/>
If you don't like Atlas Quest then don't use it.<br/>
(That also means don't use alter egos to toss in nasty comments on the boards which is very much like tossing a handgrenade and leaving the room)<br/>
<br/>
You can use part of Atlas Quest and you can block the stuff you do not like.<br/>
<br/>
I do not like, cooties, PTs, dumpster boxes, Letterbox Trading Cards,on line logging,on line comments from finders and many other things that have popped into this game, but I don't have to participate in these aspects of what others consider part of the game.<br/>
<br/>
Gatherings? Large ones we dislike, but small unorganized get to gethers are great. We participate with the ones we like.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned in an earlier post how this list has dwindled down as compared to the Newboxer list. While I too think that is sad, it may have more to do with the acidic tone rather than real content. I think the 'grown up' discussions many times result in 'juvenile' nastiness.<br/>
<br/>
The Newboxer list has helped in removing some of the tired questions such as "What is a Hitch Hiker?" for the 34th time, and with the newboxer receiving friendlier responses I think it is quite natural that the newboxer would continue at that chatlist.<br/>
<br/>
Making profits from Letterboxing???<br/>
There are several examples I could use, but here is a couple.....<br/>
<br/>
Letterbox Home Companion, probably not a large section of Randy's portfolio but never-the-less there is a potential profit motive and certainly a direction in what he would consider an explanation of the game.<br/>
<br/>
There are numerous Pub boxes in Dartmoor that are used at a magnet for customers, and most of those have a history that outdates our own history of letterboxing on this side of the pond.<br/>
<br/>
Ryan's efforts in creating "his" idea of a letterboxing site is not so foreign to many new boxers, but if one fails to use a part or piece of Atlas Quest in atleast searching for clues then they are only reducing the potential for finds.<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that it is possible to put the genie back into the bottle and pop the cork back on, so the best bet is to use what you want and disregard the stuff you don't want.<br/>
