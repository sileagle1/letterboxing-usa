<br/>
Went out and checked these boxes yesterday. Here are their present <br/>
status:<br/>
<br/>
Bow of Legolas - Missing. Will recarve and plant at same location <br/>
using a fake rock before the Oct. 4th event.<br/>
<br/>
Leaf of Lorian - Likewise missing. Likewise the recarve and replant.<br/>
<br/>
Elfin Forest - Is still there; although, the sign near it, part of <br/>
the clue, is missing. Sigh. You would think folks would not tear up <br/>
the place like that. Will reencode the clues to give better <br/>
directions. Meanwhile, if you find where the sign used to be (there <br/>
is fresh wood construction there), the clues remain the same.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you folks who have found it.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Labor Day,<br/>
Sir Balthazar<br/>
