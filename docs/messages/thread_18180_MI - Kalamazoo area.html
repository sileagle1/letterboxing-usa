                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Woods in the City" letterbox, reported (and confirmed)<br/>
missing in February 2004, has been found. While scouting a new <br/>
location for its replacement, I was doing a bit trash picking in the <br/>
woods and saw a baggie lying on the ground. Lo and behold, there was <br/>
the missing "Woods in the City" over a hundred yards from its<br/>
original site deeper into the woods. The box was slightly open and an <br/>
outer bag badly torn apart. Obviously the last visitors were <br/>
critters. (I don't put bags around the outside of my boxes for <br/>
precisely this reason). All contents were clean and dry although the <br/>
box was soaked inside  log, stamp and other contents were <br/>
individually bagged.<br/>
It will be put back at its original site after a bit of camouflage <br/>
treatment. Its replacement had already been carved so "Woods in the <br/>
City II" will be companion to the original at another location in the <br/>
Blanche Hull Preserve in Kalamazoo.<br/>
Clues for both boxes coming soon.<br/>
