useful page with links to info to help you get started: <br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/GettingStarted/<br/>
Also, I highly recommend you join the newboxers Yahoo group in addition <br/>
to this one.<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
It's a list specifically designed for newbies, so you can get any and <br/>
all of your starting out questions answered and meet lots of other <br/>
boxers who are just starting out (and some veterans as well).<br/>

Beside the links listed below you can find a bunch of info listed in <br/>
the links section of the LbNA home page. I think it is <br/>
titled "Getting Started".<br/>
If you take the time to check out everything that is covered then <br/>
you will be ready to start.<br/>

Doug probably has the best info site on Hitchhikers and links to <br/>
regional chatlists.<br/>
<br/>
AtlasQuest:<br/>

Ryan has a link set up "Code of Conduct" that is really good for all<br/>
boxers to read<br/>

I letterbox with my daughter (42) most of the time on Long Island, NY where we live.  But with the others in my family when we visit in NH or Ct or on vacation in Maine etc. Our group ranges in ages from 73- my granddaughters 17 &amp; 10 and my new grandson 3 weeks.   Letterboxing is a great outdoor family event for us and a wonderfuf hobby for me now that I am retired.r<br/>

will not want that name when you are more experienced.  Unless of <br/>
course, it has some other meaning for you.  :)<br/>
