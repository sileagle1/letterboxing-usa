                    <div class="plaintext-content">Marty has stepped down as Ring Master for the Letterboxing Web ring, <br/>
and I have agreed to take his place. The only snafu we ran into was <br/>
getting me set up to take his place, so he suggested that I set up a <br/>
new ring. As you may know, Yahoo has taken over the Web Ring thing, <br/>
so the setup is a bit different. <br/>
<br/>
Within the next few days I will email all current Web sites on the <br/>
Ring with the updated navigation information.<br/>
<br/>
Jay Chamberlain has agreed to be co-Ring Master, so once this initial <br/>
flurry of activity is over, I'll set him up, too, to help manage the <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Because I couldn't use the same Ring name, Marty and I agreed that <br/>
the name "Letterboxing North America" would be good. I hope that is <br/>
agreeable with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
If there are any concerns with this, please email me or post to the <br/>
group.<br/>
