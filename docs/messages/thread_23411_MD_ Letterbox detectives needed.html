the clues are incomplete. I was never able to retrieve the clues from <br/>
my broken digital voice recorder, so I wrote them up as best as I <br/>
could recall. If you search for any of these boxes and find them, I <br/>
would appriciate any help you could give me by emailing me more <br/>
accurate clues so that I could then update my own. The Letterboxes are <br/>
located in Maryland between DC and Baltimore;<br/>
BWI Trail Letterbox<br/>
Baltimore &amp; Annapolis Trail Letterbox<br/>
Anacostia Tributary Trail Series Letterboxes<br/>
Thanks for the help and good hunting.<br/>
