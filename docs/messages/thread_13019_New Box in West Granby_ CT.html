Directions to Holcomb Farm:  From the center of Granby, take Route 20 <br/>
West approximately 2.5 miles to Day Street South on the left.  Follow <br/>
Day Street South a short distance to the end.  You can't miss the big <br/>
red barns directly in front of you that mark Holcomb Farm.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
When you get to Holcomb Farm, turn away from the red buildings and <br/>
cross Simsbury Road.<br/>
Across the road you will find a gate - open it and walk through.  <br/>
Your journey to succession has begun, walking on a green path between <br/>
parallel lines.<br/>
When your progression reaches the woodlands, walk left to a gate.<br/>
After going through the gate, walk amongst a pine grove path lined <br/>
with ferns.<br/>
Follow the path for a ways until you come to a fork in the path.<br/>
At the fork, you should walk in the direction of Pine Grove.<br/>
If you walk further more, you'll come to another fork amongst a large <br/>
rock pile.<br/>
At the rock pile, you should go right, no long puddle should be seen <br/>
on your path.<br/>
On this path you should see a massive, decaying pine tree.<br/>
Your prize will be based at the bottom of this massive tree.<br/>
