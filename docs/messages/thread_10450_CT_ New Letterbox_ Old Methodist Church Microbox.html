<br/>Marlborough, CT

<br/>Easy Drive by!  
<br/>
<br/>This microbox has been placed in honor of Marlborough's 200th anniversary.  In 1803, the town of Marlborough was formed from land which used to be Hebron, Colchester and Glastonbury.  Since this is a microbox, please bring a stamp pad and a pen with you.  This stamp was the first stamp I ever carved.  Please be kind!
<br/>
<br/>Take Route 2 to exit 13.  At the end of the ramp, turn onto Route 66 West.  At your first traffic light, turn right onto North Main Street.  You may park at numerous places for this box, including the Town Hall (on your right) or Ofshay's (is it still called this???) on the corner on the left, in front of the mural.  I wouldn't park on the street however.
<br/>
<br/>Walk to the new town green, located at the intersection of Route 66 and North Main Street.  This plot of land used to house the Old Methodist Church.  This building was destroyed by fire and rebuilt back in the 1800's.  The membership declined and church services were discontinued.  The Library Association purchased the building and it held the library and town hall until the 1980's.  This is when the library moved into their new building on School Street and the Town Hall moved next door.  The building was demolished in the 1990's (much to many town folks' dismay) and Jones Hollow Road was rerouted through to make the present town green.  If you look across the street, there is a mural of the old Methodist Church on the side of Ofshay's Convenience Store.  The Old Methodist Church microbox is located in the south side of the stone wall which abuts the town hall property.  Walk to the end of the stone wall (not the corner) where there is an old stump.  From the stump, walk on the southern side of the wall five steps to find a white rock.  Underneath the white (quartz??? I'm sure Jay Drew could tell me....) rock is a flat rock.  You will find your treasure underneath this flat rock.
<br/>
<br/>Happy Hunting!  (And be careful of the rock hard snow.... it was very slick when I planted this box!!!)</body></html>
