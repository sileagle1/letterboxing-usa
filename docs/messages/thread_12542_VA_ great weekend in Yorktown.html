<br/>
Just returned from Yorktown. We introduced another 2 families to Lb (we<br/>
should be getting some more plants real soon!).  They took us to the<br/>
Mariners Museum.  We started with 3 families and 11 kids (ages 2-10), one<br/>
family dropped out after the first mile. The rest of us continued on, we<br/>
found boxes #1 and #2 then ran out of time.  We were halfway around the 5<br/>
mile loop, and running out of daylight so we had to skip the last two boxes<br/>
(ohhhhh, how I hate not to complete something!!!)  We're going back to that<br/>
area in a few weeks for another gym meet...and I'm determined to find the<br/>
last two.<br/>
<br/>
We also went to York River State Park and found Cardinals Rule and Taskinas<br/>
Creek Letterboxes.  I think Taskinas Creeks creative stamp has been my<br/>
favorite so far.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing from the Happy Homeschoolers<br/>
