I did a search on my system and couldn't find it either but it's on the <br/>
list of programs and I've set up on my computer to open .JPG files in <br/>
it.  I actually searched the Microsoft site to find out WHERE on my <br/>
system it resided.  <br/>
<br/>
If you cut/paste this:<br/>
<br/>
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\PhotoEd<br/>
<br/>
into a Windows Explorer Address, you should see it.  Right click it and <br/>
send to the Desktop as a Shortcut.  I've never used Picture IT.  Does <br/>
it have the STAMP function?  If you don't have a it, you can increase <br/>
the Contrast to get the same result.<br/>

OK, here's a weird one. For most, but not all (that's what's weird - <br/>
go figure) of the photos on our PC, we can get to Photo Editor right <br/>
from Windows Picture and Fax Viewer. (which is what opens photos <br/>
from the mydocument pop-up thingy from the toolbar) Just right-click <br/>
on the photo, choose "Open with", and ta-daaa, it's one of the <br/>
options.<br/>
