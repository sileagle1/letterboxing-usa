Name of letterbox:  Prairie Rose<br/>
My name: P. Granola (p2jd@aol.com)<br/>
Date Placed: 4-13-03<br/>
Placed in honor of the restored prairie effort at Willowbrook <br/>
Wildlife Center<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
State: Illinois<br/>
County: Dupage<br/>
City:  Glen Ellyn<br/>
Location:  Willowbrook Wildlife Center<br/>
Directions: A few Miles West of 355 on Roosevelt Rd (route 38). Take <br/>
Roosevelt road to Park Blvd.  Turn South onto Park Blvd., travel <br/>
about 3 miles.  Willowbrook Wildlife Center is located on the West <br/>
side of the street; there is a brown sign at the entrance. <br/>
History:  The Willowbrook Wildlife Center is a part of the DuPage <br/>
County Forest Preserve District.  Primarily it is a center for the <br/>
care and rehabilitation of injured wildlife.  There are indoor and <br/>
outdoor displays of animals that are too damaged to be released into <br/>
the wild but well enough not to be euthanized. The center is a great <br/>
family attraction.  Make sure you visit indoors and then look around <br/>
outside at the Koi pond, prairie garden and wild animals.<br/>
Behind the nature center there are hiking trails that take the <br/>
visitor through a variety of ecosystems (deciduous forest, savannah, <br/>
pond &amp; prairie) <br/>
Clues: After you have toured the center and wandered around outside, <br/>
make your way to the path that reads "nature trails" (It's located <br/>
between the red tailed hawks and passenger pigeons cages).  If you <br/>
would like you can take a trail map out of the mailbox located to the <br/>
right.  (Just make sure to put the map back when you are done.)  <br/>
Cross the bridge and you will come to a fork in the road.  Turn left <br/>
and begin walking.  The DuPage River will be on your left and the <br/>
savannah will be on your right. Continue walking and be sure to read <br/>
the interpretive signs along the way.  You will walk in a loop, as <br/>
you travel the savannah will turn into prairie.  Read the signs <br/>
carefully.  When you see the sign that says" Restoration and <br/>
Management" you will want to stop. In front of the sign there will be <br/>
beautiful prairie, if you look to your left you will see Muskrat <br/>
Pond.  You will want to look to your right and retrace your steps by <br/>
about twenty paces.  There will be a tiny path on your right that you <br/>
can take.  You will see a bench, you might want to stop and rest for <br/>
a while!  From the end of the bench you will continue to walk about <br/>
20 paces. Stop and look to your left, (if you pass the two stands of <br/>
trees with the woodpile in between them you have gone too far.) Now <br/>
look into the woods on your left, start walking, and look for the <br/>
tree whose roots look like a spider.  Walk over the three thick roots <br/>
and stop.  If you have a compass you will want to look about 60 <br/>
degrees NE. (If you don't have a compass look ahead and slightly to <br/>
the right.)  You will see a large tree with a smaller one that has <br/>
fallen over next to it.  The smaller tree looks like a bent elbow. <br/>
Travel to those trees and look for the Prairie Rose box.  Happy <br/>
hunting!!<br/>
Caution: Watch out! There is poison ivy in the woods but none noted <br/>
where the box was placed<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Please dont forget to mention that the park it is located in closes <br/>
at 5 and specifically, the trail closes at 4. We had the misfortune <br/>
of finding that out yesterday, but we'll be back. It looked like a <br/>
really cool place.<br/>

I took some non-LBer's on your trail to give them the idea of how <br/>
LBing works, anyway when we got there, your box seems to have  <br/>
weathered the storms somewhat well, but the stamp pad is <br/>
waterlogged and is dripping a little red inside the box, but the <br/>
book is totally fine and dry. I'm so mad because I didn't have my <br/>
emergency LBing repair kit with me. I'm sorry. So if you go there, <br/>
just bring some paper towels. just thought you might like the <br/>
heads up.<br/>

They're not the hardcore hiking type. Oh well, they don't know <br/>
what they're missin'!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hey Granola,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I took some non-LBer's on your trail to give them the idea of <br/>
how <br/>
&gt; &gt; LBing works, anyway when we got there, your box seems to <br/>
have  <br/>
&gt; &gt; weathered the storms somewhat well, but the stamp pad is <br/>
&gt; &gt; waterlogged and is dripping a little red inside the box, but the <br/>
&gt; &gt; book is totally fine and dry. I'm so mad because I didn't have <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; emergency LBing repair kit with me. I'm sorry. So if you go <br/>
there, <br/>
&gt; &gt; just bring some paper towels. just thought you might like the <br/>
&gt; &gt; heads up.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Name of letterbox:  Prairie Rose<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My name: P. Granola (p2jd@a...)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Date Placed: 4-13-03<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Placed in honor of the restored prairie effort at Willowbrook <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Wildlife Center<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Difficulty: Easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; State: Illinois<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; County: Dupage<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; City:  Glen Ellyn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Location:  Willowbrook Wildlife Center<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Directions: A few Miles West of 355 on Roosevelt Rd (route <br/>
&gt; &gt; 38). Take <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Roosevelt road to Park Blvd.  Turn South onto Park Blvd., <br/>
travel <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about 3 miles.  Willowbrook Wildlife Center is located on <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; West <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; side of the street; there is a brown sign at the entrance. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; History:  The Willowbrook Wildlife Center is a part of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; DuPage <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; County Forest Preserve District.  Primarily it is a center for <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; care and rehabilitation of injured wildlife.  There are indoor <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; outdoor displays of animals that are too damaged to be <br/>
&gt; &gt; released into <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the wild but well enough not to be euthanized. The center is <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; great <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; family attraction.  Make sure you visit indoors and then look <br/>
&gt; &gt; around <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside at the Koi pond, prairie garden and wild animals.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Behind the nature center there are hiking trails that take the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; visitor through a variety of ecosystems (deciduous forest, <br/>
&gt; &gt; savannah, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pond &amp; prairie) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Clues: After you have toured the center and wandered <br/>
around <br/>
&gt; &gt; outside, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; make your way to the path that reads "nature trails" (It's <br/>
&gt; located <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; between the red tailed hawks and passenger pigeons <br/>
cages).  <br/>
&gt; &gt; If you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would like you can take a trail map out of the mailbox <br/>
located to <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; right.  (Just make sure to put the map back when you are <br/>
&gt; &gt; done.)  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cross the bridge and you will come to a fork in the road.  <br/>
Turn <br/>
&gt; &gt; left <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and begin walking.  The DuPage River will be on your left <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; savannah will be on your right. Continue walking and be <br/>
sure <br/>
&gt; &gt; to read <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the interpretive signs along the way.  You will walk in a <br/>
loop, <br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you travel the savannah will turn into prairie.  Read the <br/>
signs <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; carefully.  When you see the sign that says" Restoration <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Management" you will want to stop. In front of the sign there <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; &gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; beautiful prairie, if you look to your left you will see Muskrat <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pond.  You will want to look to your right and retrace your <br/>
steps <br/>
&gt; &gt; by <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about twenty paces.  There will be a tiny path on your right <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can take.  You will see a bench, you might want to stop and <br/>
&gt; &gt; rest for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a while!  From the end of the bench you will continue to <br/>
walk <br/>
&gt; &gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 20 paces. Stop and look to your left, (if you pass the two <br/>
stands <br/>
&gt; &gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trees with the woodpile in between them you have gone too <br/>
&gt; &gt; far.) Now <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; look into the woods on your left, start walking, and look for <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tree whose roots look like a spider.  Walk over the three <br/>
thick <br/>
&gt; &gt; roots <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and stop.  If you have a compass you will want to look <br/>
about 60 <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; degrees NE. (If you don't have a compass look ahead and <br/>
&gt; &gt; slightly to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the right.)  You will see a large tree with a smaller one that <br/>
&gt; has <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fallen over next to it.  The smaller tree looks like a bent <br/>
&gt; elbow. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Travel to those trees and look for the Prairie Rose box.  <br/>
Happy <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hunting!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Caution: Watch out! There is poison ivy in the woods but <br/>
none <br/>
&gt; &gt; noted <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; where the box was placed<br/>
