I don't know why the Westborough clue doesn't come up - it's still <br/>
there:<br/>
<br/>
Peace on Earth Letterbox<br/>
Westborough, MA, Worcester County<br/>
Placed December 11, 2001 by Warrior Woman<br/>
Easy clues and terrain<br/>
<br/>
In these days of urban sprawl and industrial buildup, it is <br/>
comforting to know that you can still find "Peace On Earth" on one of <br/>
the last remaining working farms in the Metrowest/Central MA area.  <br/>
Farmer Harvey represents the fifth generation of farming on this <br/>
land.  Crops include corn, pumpkins, and a variety of fruits and <br/>
vegetables.<br/>

Thanks for the info! It's too bad about the Fledglings box. If it is <br/>
true that it was near the geocache in the area, then it was literally <br/>
in my backyard..I live down the hill on the Berlin side and hike by <br/>
there all the time.<br/>

&gt; comforting to know that you can still find "Peace On Earth" on one <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; the last remaining working farms in the Metrowest/Central MA area.  <br/>
&gt; Farmer Harvey represents the fifth generation of farming on this <br/>
&gt; land.  Crops include corn, pumpkins, and a variety of fruits and <br/>
&gt; vegetables.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From Route 495, take exit 21A.  At the dining establishment that <br/>
&gt; bears the name of a precious metal eating utensil, take a left onto <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; street with the name of a tree.  Follow this tree street all the <br/>
way <br/>
&gt; to the end.  Bear left onto Route 135.  Don't be fooled by the <br/>
first <br/>
&gt; sign that bears the name of the famous invisible rabbit!  The one <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; seek is 1.5 miles past the "Entering Westborough" sign.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The entrance to the farm is located on another street with the name <br/>
&gt; of a tree, this one a bit more colorful in the fall.  Take a right <br/>
&gt; onto this street and you will be greeted by a welcome sign and the <br/>
&gt; parking lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although the farm is officially open to the public April 1 through <br/>
&gt; December 24, 10 am to 5 pm, Farmer Harvey has graciously provided a <br/>
&gt; hiding spot for the "Peace On Earth" letterbox that is accessible <br/>
&gt; year round.  Please respect Farmer Harvey's generosity and limit <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; search for the letterbox during the off-season to just the <br/>
letterbox <br/>
&gt; location.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Look for Farmer Harvey's own big red rocket ship attached to the <br/>
&gt; giant gift barn.  Squeeze inside the rocket ship hatch to go on <br/>
your <br/>
&gt; journey to search for a sap bucket hanging from a hook.  You can <br/>
&gt; harvest your prize inside of a potato sack inside the sap bucket.  <br/>
&gt; Extra bonus!  A beautiful sticker comes along with the stamp to <br/>
show <br/>
&gt; evidence of your celestial journey.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you do visit the farm during its "officially" open season, you <br/>
&gt; will be delighted by the farm's own little "Shining Time Station", <br/>
&gt; covered bridge, animals for feeding, picnic area, country store, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; seasonal splendor.  The farm also offers high quality plants and <br/>
&gt; herbs, produce and baked goods, unique gifts and decorations, <br/>
Yankee <br/>
&gt; Candles, and wind chimes, just to name a few temptations.  Stroll <br/>
&gt; about and listen to the continuously playing soothing music, find a <br/>
&gt; cozy nook, and sample your very own "Peace On Earth".<br/>
