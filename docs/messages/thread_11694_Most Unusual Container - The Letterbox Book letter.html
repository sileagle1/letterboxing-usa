"The Letterbox Book" is a booklet about letterboxing in the form of <br/>
a book that is itself a letterbox.  <br/>
<br/>
It is a word document that makes a 250 page 5.5" x 8.5" book, either <br/>
hand bound or Velobound or other method.  <br/>
<br/>
The first few pages are a basic description of letterboxing.  The <br/>
next several pages would contain whatever local letterboxing clues <br/>
you wish to insert (by permission of their authors).  In the last <br/>
150 pages or so you cut out a hole to place a rubber stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
I found if the hole was small enough I did not even have to glue the <br/>
cut pages together.  I glued the stamp to a thin wood backing, <br/>
drilled a hole in the corner and tied it into the binding with a <br/>
narrow strong ribbon.  The bottom half of those same 150 pages are <br/>
available as the logbook for stamping in.  And voila, you have a <br/>
letterbox book letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
The book is easy to print.  It prints on 8.5" x 11" paper, double <br/>
sided, using the "booklet" printing feature to keep track of the <br/>
pages in sections.  You cut the pages in half, carve out the hole <br/>
for the stamp, and then assemble it.  If you don't have easy access <br/>
to laserprinters a Kinko's like place probably would not charge a <br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
My better half plans on nicely hand binding one but for now I have <br/>
Velobound it at the office and taped the title on the spine.<br/>
<br/>
Then you talk the librarian into giving permission to place it on a <br/>
shelf.  I even got a library sticker for the call number on the <br/>
spine.  Library staff just grab it and move it like any other book <br/>
because it has real call numbers.  I guess it would work in a <br/>
bookstore too.  Then you post clues on LBNA as usual.<br/>
<br/>
To help convince the librarian I include a bibliography page listing <br/>
books from his/her library with their call numbers that are of <br/>
relevance to letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
I am willing to send the Word document to anyone who wants to use it <br/>
provided they abide by the simple copyright notice, i.e. don't <br/>
publish it for money or alter the title page.  I might even be <br/>
talked into making one for someone.<br/>
