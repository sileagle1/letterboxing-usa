The stamps are hand carved. I learned a lot from carving the Corbeau stamp,<br/>

The Corbeau Letterbox<br/>
Indiana<br/>
Placed Friday, March 17, 2000 by Mark Sheehan<br/>
Access: Moderate          Clues: Easy-Moderate<br/>
<br/>
Find the first preserve established in Indiana by The Nature Conservancy.<br/>
Park under the power transmission lines. The trail into the preserve forks:<br/>
the left fork goes up the hill under the power lines; the right fork<br/>
parallels Clear Creek. Easiest access to the letterbox is via the right<br/>
fork. Follow the path along the base of the bluff to the first tributary<br/>
stream. Make your way across the tributary and find the southbound path that<br/>
begins a few yards up the tributary. Follow the path up onto the ridge to<br/>
the south. (I think this second ridge is part of the preserve, but am not<br/>
sure; the property is not posted against trespassing, however, and I know it<br/>
is frequently visited.) Follow the ridgetop south and find the flat<br/>
limestone exposures that overlook the creek. From one of them you will see a<br/>
microwave tower on the horizon at a bearing of 258 degrees (set your compass<br/>
declination to seven degrees east). From the same overlook you will see a<br/>
power transmission pylon at a bearing of 317 degrees. From this spot follow<br/>
a bearing of 58 degrees uphill to an area of broken, scattered limestone<br/>
rocks. Toward the east edge of this cluster of rocks is a flat one that has<br/>
two holes in it. One hole is a near-perfect cylinder; the other is a figure<br/>
eight. Both holes go completely through the rock. Swing the rock aside to<br/>
the right. Inspect the exposed area closely for snakes. This is copperhead<br/>
country; their venom is poisonous. You will see the letterbox here.<br/>

The Raptor Letterbox<br/>
Indiana<br/>
Placed Sunday, March 19, 2000 by Mark Sheehan<br/>
Access: Easy         Clues: Easy-Moderate<br/>
<br/>
Locate the impoundment that provided water to the city of Bloomington prior<br/>
to the construction of Lake Lemon. The southeast end of the lake is<br/>
accessible by road. Find the bridge and causeway area and the parking lot<br/>
north of it. From the extreme east end of the parking lot, proceed east and<br/>
immediately cross two short boardwalks over small streams. From the east end<br/>
of the second boardwalk follow the trail that parallels the lake edge 140<br/>
paces. (My stride is 35 inches.) Stop. About 100 feet head of you, you will<br/>
see junctions of the green, blue, and red hiking trails near another<br/>
boardwalk. (This information just confirms that you are in the right place;<br/>
don't go to the junction.) On your left is the trunk of a large tree that<br/>
fell many years ago. It has come to rest against a smaller, living tree<br/>
whose diameter at breast height is seven inches (in the year 2000). In the<br/>
leaf litter at the base of the smaller tree, sheltered by the fallen trunk,<br/>
is the letterbox. Please reconceal the box carefully as this is a much-used<br/>
trail.<br/>
