Dear wonderful friends,<br/>
<br/>
    Erik Davis, The Vermont Viking, has left this world of green <br/>
mountains, flowers, carvings, music and all things constructed to <br/>
dance upon the wind and shower our memories with whimsy.  <br/>
<br/>
    Erik died at home, in his childhood bed, looking out over the <br/>
mountains as the sun set on June 18th.  He had devoted his last <br/>
energies to witnessing his son's 6th grade promotion and died the <br/>
same day, much to the surprise of all those around him.  <br/>
<br/>
    Your postcards, stamps, hitchhikers and words  have been a <br/>
wonderful source of solace to Ben, Anna and me.  Your tokens of <br/>
appreciation have served as a memorial to a beloved father and <br/>
husband.  We thank you all.   The notes and stamps have also helped <br/>
explain letterboxing to a continually puzzled "outer" circle of <br/>
family and friends, I think we have a few converts!<br/>
<br/>
    Metastatic melanoma is an unpredictable disease with a will of <br/>
its own, but there is something you can do ...use sunscreen.   <br/>
Childhood peeling sunburns are the culprit.<br/>
Erik struggled with melanoma, it effects and some risky and <br/>
courageous clinical trials, for 4.5 years and died at age 56.  Use <br/>
sunscreen.<br/>
<br/>
With thanks,<br/>
Susan<br/>

     Please accept our sympathy on the tragic loss of Erik; a man who has done <br/>

New Hampshire. I have asked him and would like your permission to begin raising <br/>

What better way to memorialize such a letterboxing advocate by taking donations <br/>
in his name to publish a book that fosters the sport he so loved? You may <br/>
contact me offline if you are interested.<br/>

<br/>
You are in my thoughts and prayers. I too lost my dear husband to melanoma, <br/>
three and a half years ago. Your dear Erik, though he never met many of us, <br/>
helped touch our lives. He helped introduce so many of us to this peaceful, <br/>
family-friendly, active hobby. He encouraged us to go to beautiful natural places <br/>
and share the joys we found there.<br/>
<br/>
Please take comfort in knowing that the heavy fog you are feeling now will <br/>
one day lift. It takes time and work and the support of friends (please know we <br/>
are here for you), but it will come. Please contact me off list if you would <br/>
like to talk, or would like some information on resources I found to be a <br/>
godsend.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that has helped me get back into life has been <br/>
letterboxing. It got me to go to places I never would have gone, and went out to meet <br/>
people I never would have met. I am truly thankful for that. Erik was one of the <br/>
pioneers in this country and we all have him to thank for that.<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry for your loss. Please take care of yourself and please reach <br/>
out if you need anything.<br/>
<br/>
With love<br/>
Kim (Rustypuff)<br/>
