Its up to the clue writer.  I don't think there is really a central<br/>
authority that can make these sorts of rules.  I know I do it by<br/>
footfalls (as do some other clues), although the "technical" <br/>
definition is by footfall of the same foot.  Since everyone's <br/>
pace is different anyway, it doesn't matter in practice, IMO, <br/>
except as a rough guide, unless pace calibration legs are used <br/>
(and then again it doesn't matter).<br/>

<br/>
I think pace calibration legs are a good way to remove luck from<br/>
the hunt, but again its up to you, the way the clue is working,<br/>
and the terrain.  Its helpful, but not necessary, to do this or<br/>
leave a note about your paces.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Right now my clues read something like "xx of my paces (I am<br/>
&gt; short) a pace is a single footfall." Is that adequate?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds good to me.<br/>

Just attended an orienteering class with my kids yesterday....I learned that <br/>
a pace is one footfall and a stride is two.  Good to know.  :o)<br/>

It's a matter of perspective. Your pace may be a <br/>
little shorter than some, but definitely longer than others. For a <br/>
different drummer, see the notes to The Beehive!<br/>
