and have never heard of this sort of problem.  I suspect that he had<br/>
misunderstood how to unsubscribe, but I may be wrong.  Either way, I would<br/>
like to know what took place.<br/>
<br/>
I have no particular interest in egroups or any other free mail service.  In<br/>
general, I could care less how we get our messages transmitted.  I must<br/>
confess, however, that I am rather fond of the archive that egroups provides.<br/>
I, personally, use this on a daily basis to monitor the messages of this group<br/>
from my workplace, where I do not have access to my home email account.  I do<br/>
not want to add my work address to the mailing list.  I doubt that Randy<br/>
intends to provide such an archive for us.<br/>
<br/>
The archive provides a way for people to keep up with our discussions without<br/>
having to add themselves to the mailing list.  Some people are interested in<br/>
our progress but do not want their mailbox filled with messages (such as<br/>
myself, where my work address is concerned).  Some people have access to the<br/>
net through a library, but do not have an email account.  We will be closing<br/>
the door on these people if we lose the archive.  I have even used the archive<br/>
to reference old messages that have long since been removed from my mailbox by<br/>
my ISP.  The archive provides a permanent record of every message that has<br/>
been sent since the beginning of our talk list.  I, for one, would hate to see<br/>
this tossed away like an old newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion...<br/>

Point well taken.  I suppose if Randy cannot provide that same function it would<br/>
be worth the adverts to stay on with egroups.  My main concern was the person<br/>
who said he attempted to unsubscribe and failed 7 times.  Was that the fault of<br/>
egroups?  We need to find out more about what happened because if the service is<br/>
that unreliable we may want to move elsewhere, if not to Randy then to some<br/>
other<br/>
free list service with a better track record.<br/>

We will definitely want to get to the bottom of this before we start setting<br/>
up lists for each state (if that is what we all agree to do).  I am curious if<br/>
that guy was doing something wrong, or if there is a time factor for an<br/>
automatic unsubscribtion to take effect, and he was just impatient, or what...<br/>
<br/>
I have had questions and a few minor problems with egroups in the past, and<br/>
emailed their technical support people.  I was very pleasantly surprised at<br/>
their level of responsiveness.  They answered my questions and fixed the minor<br/>
bugs I had come across.  I have noticed half a dozen or more improvements to<br/>
the service just since we started this list... mostly minor things that are<br/>
only apparent to the people who manage the lists.  It is my experience that<br/>
this level of support is seldom offered for a free service of any kind, on or<br/>
off the Net.  Now I really DO sound like a salesman or stockholder for the<br/>
company!!  Sorry... it's just that there are a lot of imperfect things in this<br/>
world, but very few of them try to do anything about it.<br/>

It is listed on the page as:<br/>
<br/>
To unsubscribe, send a message to: <br/>
   egroups.com-unsubscribe@letterbox-usa<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT a valid email address.  If you look in the "help" page, they<br/>
correctly show the unsubscribe syntax as:<br/>
<br/>
groupname-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>
<br/>
So it's really:<br/>
letterbox-usa-unsubscribe@egroups.com<br/>
<br/>
For the record, the "subscribe" address is incorrect also.<br/>

Hope this helps!<br/>
