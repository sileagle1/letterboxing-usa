<br/>
As for Letterbox #2 in the Tualatin Hills Nature Park series.  I did the<br/>
same thing you did and thought the box was missing....but it's there.<br/>
You must keep going and going and looking for the rock with the<br/>
predator.  Eventually, you'll figure out why you didn't see the rock<br/>
before -- because it's not where you were looking.  Same as me.  <br/>
<br/>
Tom Cheney did a great job on this series.  I've heard some of the boxes<br/>
are missing.  I've gotten the first four, but have yet to hunt for the<br/>
others.  <br/>
<br/>
My Rick's Farm series is at the same park and, hopefully, most of them<br/>
are easily gotten (except for the missing three).  <br/>
<br/>
Another great series that is supposed to be a pretty nice bunch is the<br/>
Rock Creek Neighborhood series placed by Der Mad Stamper and Thom<br/>
Cheney.  I haven't nabbed those myself, but I hear they are great finds!  <br/>
<br/>
"Who Let The Dogs Out" in Forest Park is fun and has gotten high marks<br/>
especially from children!   It's not too long a hike and the letterboxes<br/>
are not too tough.  That series was kid-tested by my nephew Travis and<br/>
he really enjoyed it.  Other kids have really had a good time seeking<br/>
out this series.  Your kid will probably enjoy it, too!  Dog #2, Rover<br/>
has been missing since spring, so forget about him.  I hear the others<br/>
are still there, though!  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
