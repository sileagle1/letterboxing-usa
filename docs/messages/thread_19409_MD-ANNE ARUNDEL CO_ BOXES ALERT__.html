ALL AA CO. BOXES MIGHT BE PULLED SOMETIME IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS!!!!! <br/>
Shane "Pathmaker" Odom here, new boxer in the Annapolis MD area. My <br/>
family and I have been stamping in as the "Woodwoses". <br/>
Recently our local newspaper has done an article about boxing in the <br/>
area, nice little article, they talked with both a boxer and Park <br/>
Rangers. Well.....I had a feeling about this, boxing is not the only <br/>
hobby I have and I know that press is not always a good thing. I took <br/>
the ball and ran with it. Called AA Co. Recreation dept. Spoke with <br/>
the rec director, John Marshall. Yes, he had seen the article and no <br/>
he had not heard of Boxing before this article. HOWEVER! They do have <br/>
a policy on GeoCacheing and they plan on implementing the same <br/>
towards Letterboxing. That is, <br/>
ALL BOXES WILL BE PULLED SOMETIME IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS!!!!!!! <br/>
UNLESS the placers of the boxes come forward and request permission. <br/>
They don't wish to deny boxing but they are serious about getting <br/>
permission and following their policies, i.e. not profanity, or other <br/>
unacceptable content in boxes, boxes must be in non-sensitive areas, <br/>
etc. All things that from what I have seen boxers do anyway, except <br/>
of course, asking for permission. He said it will be easy, it is a <br/>
standard form that they use for Geocacheing and they will just fill <br/>
in the blanks with boxing. I gave him my number, after noteing very <br/>
strongly that I represent no one but myself and am not responsible <br/>
for the currently existing boxes. I told him I would pass on our <br/>
communication and I would try to help adopt any boxes that are not <br/>
permited soon. I hope that someone from the local area who is a more <br/>
regular boxer might come forward on this as well. More articles <br/>
always mean more boxers and more boxes and more issues. I know there <br/>
is a Gathering this wknd and I hope this issue is brought up there. I <br/>
don't have the time or resources to adopt all the boxes in the Co. <br/>
and I sure want to see this hobby continue in our area. Look forward <br/>
to some response, I will list my phone number so local folks who <br/>
might help with this can contact me. I will cross post this to the <br/>
newboxers, and LBNA lists. <br/>
Much Peace and Happy Trails,<br/>
