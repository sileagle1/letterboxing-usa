If you "look inside" 'Art Stamping Workshop' you'll see that Gloria Page mentions letterboxing.org. Some of you might remember the online website/zine,' Tabloid Trash'. Bob and Rusty Clark created that inspirational eraser carving site. <br/>

 stamp carving. That would be the ultimate.  I bought stamp pads and <br/>
 water proof containers this morning.<br/>

 &gt; I just first heard about this today at work.  I am a rubberstamper <br/>
 of <br/>
 &gt; many years and someone told me to look into this.  I will slowly <br/>
 read <br/>
 &gt; the messages but this sounds like a BLAST.<br/>
 &gt; <br/>
 &gt; I am looking to learn so much and just have fun in my travels.  <br/>
 Thanks <br/>
