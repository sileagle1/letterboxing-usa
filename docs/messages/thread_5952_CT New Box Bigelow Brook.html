<p>Bigelow Brook</p>
<p>Placed: 6-29-02</p>
<p>Placed By: Chuck and Molly</p>
<p>Location: Eastford Connecticut, Windham County</p>
<p>Rated: Moderate</p>
</b><p>Coming from the intersection of 44 and 89 in Warrenville 
(Ashford) take 44 East for 3.3 miles. Coming from the intersection of routes 198 
and 44 in Phoenixville (Eastford) take 44 west for .9 of a mile. You will be 
looking for the spot where the Natchaug trail crosses route 44. There is a blue 
oval sign on each side of the road showing where the trail is. You will have to 
park off the shoulder of the road. Headed west from Phoenixville seems to me to 
have the best area for parking. This is the same starting point as Stones Brook 
Letterbox.</p>
<p></p><b>This trail has many intermittent brooks which cross 
the path and will not be included in the directions. There are several different 
types of terrain on this walk which is typical for the Natchaug Trail. Hope you 
enjoy the hike.</b><b>
</b><p>Take the Natchaug trail north down a small hill past foundations 
and walls winding up and down hills. You will be following the blue blazed 
Natchaug trail the entire way. It is approximately 1  miles to the box. Go 
through a stone wall. The trail bears left uphill then right through another 
stone wall. You will go gradually downhill until you get alongside Bigelow 
Brook. You will walk along side the river and stone wall, then through pines. 
The trail bears left and gradually goes away from the brook and quickly coming 
back to the brook. You will see a tree with markings indicating a sharp left 
turn away from the brook. You will go uphill for a good distance away from the 
brook. It starts again downhill to a wet area and gradually to the brooks edge. 
Follow the trail along the edge of the brook crossing a badly broken down stone 
wall. Keep going, passing a short amount of barbed wire between trees and stumps 
along the rivers edge. You will see across the river rock ledge that forms an 
interesting formation which resembles a kind of cave in the river. At this point 
look left and see an old blank wooden sign nailed to a tree. From that tree at 
330 degrees is a large rock. Look below on the southeast side of the rock to 
find the letterbox. If you miss the wooden sign or ledge cave, you will come to 
a tree with two blue marks indicating a turn in the trail again, going away from 
the river. Stop at this tree. Turn around and walk back the way you came 33 
steps. The rock you are looking for is the largest rock in the area and looks 
like a tree is growing out of the back of it. It is 11 steps off the 
trail.</p></div></body></html>
