this box as far back as 2003 with no luck. (It has no finds listed) It<br/>
may be one of the earlier Maine Letterbox plants listed on LbNA<br/>
(Northern Maine region) linked back to this list?<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to get compass help on a couple of different lists,<br/>
to understand how one approaches a clue like this correctly...in case<br/>
I came across such a clue again.<br/>
<br/>
"Letterbox Police" have suggested EVERYTHING is secret and even my<br/>
mention of AT was giving secrets away. Too many suggested newbies<br/>
should just tramp around looking for it, figure out the compass<br/>
reading on our own. <br/>
<br/>
The section beyond was heavily marked with signs saying "Reforestation<br/>
Area...Please stay on trail." Perhaps the Owner of this group might<br/>
consider disabling the photo until the owner of the box verifies if it<br/>
is missing or indeed intact. <br/>
<br/>
If I had known the clue was so old, with no finds reported I would<br/>
have bypassed this search. We were clearly not the first to wander<br/>
around there and if the signs for reforestation up ahead are any<br/>
indication they might not be pleased with Letterboxing as a hobby,<br/>
esp. "wild goose chases". :)<br/>
