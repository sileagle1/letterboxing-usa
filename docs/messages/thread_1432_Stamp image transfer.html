<br/>
I have been using a Dry transfer lettering tool called a burnisher. I draw<br/>
the image with a soft number two pencil on white bond paper. Once I have<br/>
the image like I want I go over the lines one more time to deposit as much<br/>
pencil as possible. I then place the image, drawing side down on the eraser<br/>
or rubber and use the burnishing tool to rub the back of the paper.  <br/>
<br/>
I have also printed an image off the computer, resized it to fit the stamp<br/>
and then used a pencil to outline the image and then transfer it the same<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
I have had my tool for some time. It is used for dry transfer lettering. I<br/>
think I got it an art or electronics supply store.<br/>
<br/>
This transfer method works better if you wipe the eraser or rubber with<br/>
alcohol first to clean the surface.<br/>
<br/>
This is what the tool looks like, <br/>

<br/>
You might also be able to do this transfer with the blunt end of a dull<br/>
kitchen knife.  The flat end of the burnisher is a flexable plastic and can<br/>
transfer an area of about 3/8 of an inch wide. The other tip is rounded and<br/>
about 1/16 of an inch across. You just keep rubbing until your image is<br/>
transfered onto the stamp. Then carve away...<br/>

here.<br/>
<br/>
I trace images on tracing paper off of whatever I like, including<br/>
photographs, graphics from magazines, etc., OR do my original drawing (very<br/>
rarely do I do this because I am not one of those who can draw well) on<br/>
tracing paper with a #2 or softer pencil.  This works great for lettering<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Then I put the tracing paper drawing side down on the eraser or other<br/>
carving material and rub it down with my finger-nail (top or tip, doesn't<br/>
matter too much).  It usually trasfers beautifully.  The only time I have<br/>
had minor problems is when I lightly scetch the image instead of putting<br/>
down a fair amount of lead on the tracing paper.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing Everyone<br/>
