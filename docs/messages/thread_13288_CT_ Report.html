                    <div class="plaintext-content">Such fun today and I am so happy to report on the H.H. Black Bear Paw of <br/>
Candlelights .  I read in the log: After hitching around in Wa. State, <br/>
Amanda from Seattle mailed the Paw to Music Woman in CT.  . she planted <br/>
it in a box belonging to Bluebird, in Madison CT.  and it then got a <br/>
ride to Seldon Creek, one of Jay Drew's boxes .After enjoying that great <br/>
view of the CT. River, he hitched today to East Lyme and into a box just <br/>
planted by Chuck and Molly.  Lobsta Lady and I found him early in the <br/>
afternoon and he had not even had a change to eat.  We carried him to a <br/>
really popular Inn for dinner and he liked it so well, just stayed.<br/>
What a busy little black bear. I must say, without even planning , he <br/>
has visited boxes  and been carried by very busy CT.letterboxing folks <br/>
and boxes. Great Stamps are in his log, and thanks Candlelight for the <br/>
fun.  None other than the Butterfly who had such a hard time with one of <br/>
your Virtuals and had the joy of you honoring me in such a special way. <br/>
 Now I get to tell you a big THANKS<br/>
Butterfly<br/>
