<h2 align="left"><span>CLUES:  </span><span>Locate the three tourist binoculars in the center of the parking lot 
across the street from the lighthouse. Now follow the walk to the right until 
you reach the stairs leading to the beach. At the bottom of the stairs, 
carefully proceed along the rocks at the bottom of the bluff until you are 
directly below your starting point. The letterbox is hidden among the rocks in 
this area.</span></h2>
