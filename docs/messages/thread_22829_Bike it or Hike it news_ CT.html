gone missing again so I've retired it for good. However, there is <br/>
still another box of mine at "Mount Carmel Station" for those riding <br/>
this trail.<br/>
<br/>
A new Bike it or Hike it box has been added. See whats new for the <br/>
Derby Greenway Letterbox in Derby, CT. Working on a map.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you wishing to check out the Windsor Locks Canal <br/>
Letterbox in Windsor, CT, you don't have much time left this year. The <br/>
trail is closed from November 14-April 1 each year. I just did some <br/>
box maintenance on it, so it should be good to go.<br/>
