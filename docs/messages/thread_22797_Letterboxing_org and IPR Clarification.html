Let me clarify - we (Clan Jiggs) have NEVER listed any box LB, PLB, <br/>
HH etc as our own that we didnt create. Those HH that were passed on <br/>
to Wanda and Pete were always credited to the originator. We do not <br/>
list any HH on LB.org except our own, and we do NOT list the HH <br/>
wherabouts anywhere.<br/>

&gt; I have been following the discussions with much interest but feel <br/>
compelled to point something out.  It has been stated that once you <br/>
release a letterbox you lose all right to it.  This is not the case.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is the policy of letterboxing.org and its webmasters that the <br/>
originator of the letterbox, regardless of the type of box - <br/>
traditional, traveller, parasite, etc, retains the intellectual <br/>
property rights to all things associated to the letterbox.  Many <br/>
placers waive their rights, especially in the case of hitchhikers, <br/>
and let the finders treat them as they wish.  No one should assume, <br/>
unless it is explicity stated otherwise, that they can assume those <br/>
rights.  This includes the right to list a box on letterboxing.org <br/>
without the originator's approval.  We have chosen to bend this <br/>
policy slightly in the case orphaned boxes by allowing others to <br/>
adopt them.  When doing so, however, we require the maintainer to <br/>
credit the originator with the orginal placement, clues, etc. as <br/>
appropriate.  That is our method of trying to maintain the <br/>
intellectual property rights of others.<br/>
