to answer your first question i would suggest that you look at who der mad<br/>
stamper is. could be real. could be fake. <br/>
<br/>
as a good starting off point for you i would suggest you join the newboxers<br/>
group. you can find them at  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br/>
<br/>
you will find the folks at the newboxers group a friendly bunch. not that we<br/>
are not friendly here, well, sometimes not. but you have to know us to love<br/>
us!<br/>
