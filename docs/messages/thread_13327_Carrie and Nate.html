<br/>
No, we haven't looked for any boxes here yet.  They just aren't as <br/>
close to home as the ones back east, and we've been too busy getting <br/>
settled to travel very far.  (Although, I do work in Sacramento and <br/>
haven't even looked for those boxes yet!)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on where to start?<br/>

Good to have new letterboxers in Nor Cal!!<br/>
<br/>
The Natamos Oak Microbox is a shady treat. Bring a picnic lunch or walk to <br/>
local restaurants. The infamous Davis Letterbox has had a couple of problems and <br/>
I don't know its status right now but I'll look into it. (It was my first and <br/>
is still the best!) Folsom Powerhouse is a good one too. I've never been able <br/>
to find the Auburn box even though I've tried 4 times! There's a new one, <br/>
Davis to Winters, which would be great on a bike but I took a car.<br/>
It's probably just as far for you to go to the Contra Costa Series boxes in <br/>
the Walnut Creek, Martinez area (east Bay Area) as the ones I've mentioned. <br/>
I've gotten #2 and #3 and they're wonderful, short hikes. I intend to get the <br/>
others soon.<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see you at the future Nor Cal Gathering!<br/>
