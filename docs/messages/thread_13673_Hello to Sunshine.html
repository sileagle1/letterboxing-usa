that "Sunshine" was already being used. When we started boxing in <br/>
March, I went thru the stamps I already owned and found a happy <br/>
little sunshine stamp, and started to use it- I hope you don't feel <br/>
I'm stepping on your toes- if so, let me know, and I'll work on <br/>
changing my identity, and stamp! We're in CT-- I think you're from <br/>
MA???????????- I've seen your stamp in a few boxes that we've been <br/>
to.- hope we meet on the trail some day- N.:0)<br/>
