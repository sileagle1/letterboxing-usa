(Video boxes are not water tight.) But wow, the area is beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to do some major repairs but prefer the permission of the<br/>
owner.<br/>
I tried contacting the placer through LBNA and have not had a reply,<br/>
the e-mail in the box is unreadable. <br/>
LBNA says that it was placed by Lisa.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help,<br/>
