placed them yesterday. Also wanted to pick an area that has little or no<br/>
current letterboxes. I think these are the first in Somers. <br/>
	My Favorite Things series - 4 letterboxes <br/>
	Planted: January 5, 2002<br/>
	By: Mamoosha &amp; Toots<br/>
	Difficulty: moderate hike 45-60 mins.<br/>
	Located on Shenipsit Trail on Bald Mountain, Somers, CT<br/>
	Directions: From the intersection where Route 83 meets Route 190 in<br/>
Somers follow 190 2.4 miles toward Stafford. Turn left onto Calbraith Road<br/>
and drive two-tenths of a mile to the Shenipsit State Forest parking area in<br/>
front of the gate. <br/>
	My Favorite Things letterbox series is based on the song of the same<br/>
name from one of my favorite movies - The Sound of Music. The series<br/>
includes favorite things of both of us. We know two of your favorite things<br/>
are represented....hiking and letterboxing. <br/>
	Here goes....follow the blue blaze trail along the dirt road for a<br/>
short time before the trail turns left into the woods. Careful stepping is<br/>
required along the trail, as is common throughout Connecticut's woods, as<br/>
roots and rocks are waiting to trip up. Continue on the trail through a<br/>
small pine grove, a crumbled stonewall on the left, and up a small incline.<br/>
Soon you will view dead trees playing pick up sticks along another<br/>
stonewall, again on the left. To find the first of My Favorite Things,<br/>
before passing the wall step off 20 paces (counting as each foot is placed<br/>
upon the earth). Stamp secretly and re-hide carefully before continuing on<br/>
the journey.<br/>
	Return to the blue blazed trail and continue up to a tabletop<br/>
covered with a pine needle tablecloth. Here the trail continues by trickling<br/>
downhill. Pass through a tree trunk that was once part of the trail but<br/>
because we don't have giant redwoods we can't make tunnels through tree<br/>
trunks. Another method has been used to clear the trail. The felled tree<br/>
trunk affords a good resting area and a view of many white birches. After<br/>
resting, continue on the trail, stepping over the erosion control trunk and<br/>
down the steadily steepening incline to Lievre Brook. Go over the crude,<br/>
hastily built bridge. Be sure to turn right to follow the trail along the<br/>
brook. The trail seems to have once gone straight after crossing the bridge<br/>
but appears to have been re-routed, perhaps during the logging that was done<br/>
and of which remnants are still strewn about. Climb up along the rock<br/>
embedded trail. As the trail flattens out you will notice some fallen<br/>
sentinels atop a rock ledge. At these sentinels, from the middle of the<br/>
trail, take a compass reading of 180 degrees. You should see a cluster of<br/>
small beech trees just beyond the rock outcroppings. The second of My<br/>
Favorite Things is at the base of the beech trees. After stamping and<br/>
re-hiding, return to the trail and turn back to begin retracing your steps.<br/>
	At the bottom of the hill, at Lievre Brook, there is a perfect<br/>
tabletop rock that can provide a pleasant viewing area if anyone in your<br/>
party wishes to explore up and down the brook. Unfortunately, it was a<br/>
little too cold to sit on any rocks this day but we did explore along the<br/>
frozen brook. After your breather resume your return trip up the hill. At<br/>
the cut-away tree, follow the trunk to the right. The tree limbs are<br/>
pointing to the cavern-like location of the third of My Favorite Things.<br/>
This particular hiding place requires careful attention when re-hiding so<br/>
the box cannot be seen from the main trail.<br/>
	Back to the trail and up again. Take a breather at the tabletop<br/>
covered with a pine needle tablecloth. Look toward the mountain laurel<br/>
grove. Snoop around the large rock seen in the center of your view for the<br/>
fourth and final of My Favorite Things. After stamping, finish up your hike<br/>
reminiscing about some of your favorite things as you return to your car.<br/>
