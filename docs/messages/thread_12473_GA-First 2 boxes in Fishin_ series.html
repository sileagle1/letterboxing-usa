Winder, Barrow County, GA<br/>
Placed by: Mark<br/>
Box webpage located at: State of GA on LbNA map.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
Fort Yargo, GA- Fort Yargo State Park<br/>
Barrow County, GA<br/>
<br/>
Fishin' (First 2 in a series of 4)<br/>
<br/>
Takes about 45 minutes. One mile of level walking.<br/>
<br/>
Fort Yargo probably has some significant history attached to it.however,<br/>
I don't know what it is so I won't try to BS you. I do know that I camped<br/>
there and it was pretty cool. I've also fished there and caught a tan, but<br/>
that's about it. However, there are fish and boxes to be had! Maybe you<br/>
should bring a fishing pole and try out these spots? This state park is<br/>
rife with picnic areas and blas' kids attractions. I made the first two<br/>
boxes, by the way they were the first two boxes I've hidden, very easy to<br/>
nab. So, hit KFC or Churches, pack up the wee folk, maybe land a fish, and<br/>
come snag some easy letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
The easiest way to get to Fort Yargo is to take Interstate 85 to exit 126<br/>
and follow the signs. If you happen to live around the area, you can also<br/>
access the park from 316 (heading towards Athens) or you can follow Hwy<br/>
(US) 29. Whateverit's your gas.<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park and pay the $2 parking fee, because it is the nice thing to<br/>
do. Continue on into the park; don't go left to the campsites, but wind<br/>
around to the right-hand side of the park. Proceed to the Picnic Areas.<br/>
This will end in a loop crowded with picnic tables. This is where you<br/>
park, and would be a good place to perhaps scarf down some lunch. But find<br/>
the end of the loop, where the road begins to head out of the area, and<br/>
park there. There is a trail along the lakeshore that goes the left as you<br/>
face the water. Follow that trail until you see three trees growing<br/>
together, followed by two tall pines growing close by one another. Stand<br/>
in-between the three tree and the two pines. Facing the twin pines, take a<br/>
bearing of 50 and step 15 paces (exaggerated steps). Stamp in and re-hide<br/>
with precisionI try to make it look like a very natural setting. This box<br/>
faces a nice spot to sink a hook. Return to your car for the next box.<br/>
<br/>
Hop in the car and head back up the road, toward the way you came in, by<br/>
completing the loop. If you are hunting in the heat, you may want to crank<br/>
up the AC at this point and enjoy the brief reprieve from Georgia summers.<br/>
At the stop sign, turn right. Follow the road and past the miniature<br/>
putt-putt course and the beach (well, really it is just sand on a lake)<br/>
and aim toward the Group Shelter A area, where there are restrooms. Park<br/>
and face the building. Sight southward and follow the trail, which again<br/>
follows the curves of the lake. Enjoy the strange sight of a lightning<br/>
strike's damage in a forest. There is a troll along the trail. Watch out<br/>
for that troll! He has stolen the letterbox and you must get it before he<br/>
comes home. And everyone knows where trolls call home. What a strange<br/>
trail! Be very stealthy and you will be rewarded. Trolls and fish and<br/>
lightning. Follow the trail up the hill to return to your car, or you can<br/>
explore some good fishin' spots!<br/>
