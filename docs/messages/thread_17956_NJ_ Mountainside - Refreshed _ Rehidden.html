DIRECTIONS: Mountainside Park is a Morris County Park in northern <br/>
Morris County, New Jersey. From Interstate 287 get off at Route 23 <br/>
heading south. Just before the second light turn right and keep <br/>
bearing right onto West Parkway for about 1/2 mile to the first <br/>
intersection with a 4-way stop. Turn right onto Mountain Avenue, <br/>
which will pass under Interstate 287. Once you pass under the bridge <br/>
the park is immediately on your right. Park your car along the right <br/>
side of the road. If you come to a no trespassing sign, you've gone <br/>
too far. Note, you will probably not see any signs saying you are at <br/>
Mountainside Park. Alternately, from Route 23 North in Pompton <br/>
Plains, take 511 ALT to make a U-turn onto Route 23 South and follow <br/>
the directions above. <br/>
<br/>
Look for Green Acres signs on trees. Search along roadside for orange <br/>
circle trail. Once orange circle blazes are located start out on <br/>
trail. Eventually you'll see a campfire.  Go 33 paces at 80 degrees <br/>
from campfire.  You'll see a boulder, behind it, hidden under some <br/>
rocks is what you seek.<br/>
