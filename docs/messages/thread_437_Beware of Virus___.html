&gt;If you receive an email titled "It Takes Guts to Say 'Jesus'" DO NOT<br/>
&gt;open it. It will erase everything on your hard drive. Forward this<br/>
&gt;letter out to as many people as you can. This is a new, very malicious<br/>
&gt;virus and not many people know about it. This information was announced<br/>
&gt;yesterday morning from IBM; please share it with everyone<br/>
&gt;that might access the internet. Once again, pass this along to EVERYONE<br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt;your<br/>
&gt;address book so that this may be stopped. AOL has said that this is a<br/>
&gt;very dangerous virus and that there is NO remedy for it at this time.<br/>
&gt;Please practice cautionary measures and forward this to all your online<br/>
