for a perfect day at the Ithaca NY gathering. It was<br/>
nice meeting so many wonderful fellow boxers. <br/>
<br/>
The weather was perfect and the food was bountiful and<br/>
delicious. <br/>
<br/>
Several interesting boxes were present including some<br/>
event-only boxes and hitchhikers from far away.<br/>
Hopefully, some may find their way to the newly<br/>
planted I Love New York HH Hostel.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Jay for your loving comments about the<br/>
Ithaca/Finger Lakes region of Upstate NY. Letterboxing<br/>
is growing quickly in this beautiful area and well<br/>
worth a visit...and NY wines are indeed fine. <br/>
