<div>Hello all!</div>

up north for a little hiking and some Valley Quests.  We would like to hike 
Mt. Mansfield, but we're not sure on which trail to take.  Any 
suggestions??</div>

Smuggler's Notch. It is fabulous!<br/>

I have a great map of Mt Mansfield if you'd like to stop by and pick <br/>
it up: give me a call at 739-4089.<br/>

Drew Clan,<br/>
    Thank you so much for letting us borrow your Mt. Mansfield map.  I can't<br/>
tell you what a relief it was to have it, especially since we did not go<br/>
past the Green Mountain Club store on the way to the mountain.  We went up<br/>
to the next exit and follow Tom's directions.  They were awesome, you should<br/>
try them sometime.  We did get a chance to place a box this weekend.  I'm<br/>
still working on the clues, but I will get them to you soon.  I will also<br/>
drop off you map one day on my way to or from school.  Thanks again for the<br/>
map, we had an awesome weekend.<br/>
    Melissa &amp; Dan<br/>
 We also found a few Valley Quests up north!<br/>
