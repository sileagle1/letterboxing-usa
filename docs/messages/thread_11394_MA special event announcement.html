                    <html><body>Hi all!
<br/>
<br/>Just want to let you folks in the MA, RI, CT area know that on Sunday, May 18 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Moose Hill Sanctuary in Sharon, MA (site of the winter gathering) we will be holding our 4th annual Spring Festival. It will be full of fun family activities, hay rides, food, vendors, silent auction and entertainment. There will be an admission fee for the day (it is a fundraiser for the sanctuary - read: it helps pay my salary ;)
<br/>
<br/>The reason I'm posting, however, is that I want to let you know that we (cscm and I) will be hosting a letterboxing table and will have an event stamp and probably a day-only box out on the trails. I hope you guys will come show your support and we would certainly welcome anyone who'd like to help out at the table.
<br/>
<br/>Cheers!
