This had never occurred to me until the boxing event in Virginia in<br/>
September. Ladybug was stamping two stamps in everyone's books, one<br/>
representing her and one representing Maggie, her white Scottish<br/>
Highlands terrier, that she had brought to the event with her. I<br/>
usually take my coonhound puppy, Bonnie, with me, and I thought Maggie<br/>
having a stamp was fantabulous! After the event, I carved Bonnie a stamp. <br/>

That doesn't include when you letterbox with oxen as I remeber Molly <br/>
had quite a bit to say to them this past summer. Of course it was all <br/>
so polite as is Molly's usual  way when meeting up with folks. It was <br/>
just the commentary on the four leggeds wearing  collars for two. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Based on all these positive responses -- I hope that letterboxing with our <br/>
puppy will be something to look forward to -- way in the future!  I think, <br/>
as she stands at 6 months, she would gladly have her own stamp (makes good <br/>
eatin')and would love being on the trails.  The problem would be stepping <br/>
over all the other people she has "greeted" and knocked over with her puppy <br/>
enthusiasm!  Plus, aside the fear of someone thinking she is a small little <br/>
deer to shoot, I would worry about her getting free of her leash and running <br/>
away.  At least the kids come when I call (well, ok, 50% of the time....).  <br/>
Little girl (dog, not child) is going in for her spay this weekend.  Maybe <br/>
she'll quiet down a little after that.  If not, we'd better keep <br/>
letterboxing for a while, waiting until she is mature enough to hit the <br/>
trails with us!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  Any good doggie psychiatrists out there?  Our little Keeshond mix <br/>
LOVES the outdoors.  She will be out in the yard all day, only agreeing to <br/>
come inside to poop on the rug and then scratching at the door to go back <br/>
out and play.  Based on my many years of pet ownership--I think she is doing <br/>
this a little backwards!!!  Any suggestions of how to encourage her to <br/>
fertilize the lawn rather than the carpets?!<br/>

the same time.  We do all of ours on the same page so we don't use up too <br/>
many log book pages.  Kind of makes a collage...<br/>

&gt;I have been enjoying this thread, even though we don't own a dog anymore!  <br/>
&gt;We<br/>
&gt;have a family stamp and I was debating whether to carve each of us (5) a<br/>
&gt;stamp to use along with our family stamp or just use the family stamp.  I<br/>
&gt;didn't want to be a logbook hog! <g>  We have only found 1 box so far <br/>
&gt;(after<br/>
&gt;a few attempts) and used the family stamp since that was all we had.  <br/>
&gt;Anyway,<br/>
&gt;since many dogs have their own stamps, now I won't feel bad if everyone has<br/>
&gt;their own stamp!<br/>
