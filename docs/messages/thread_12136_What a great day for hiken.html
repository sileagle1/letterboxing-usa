                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went out today and did a few in mansfield.Froggy Went a Courtin,The Rock Climber,Dog Gone Funny,Bird Walk (2),and Peggy Dow.All of which where in good shape.We spent a lot of time looking for the Lost Marker Letterbox but it is still lost.Found the tree,went South,got to the top and came to some sloping boulders over looking a vally seached all over everything and could not find it.This place looks like a party spot and the pile of rocks got throne over the edge.But all in all we had a great day,made some new exchanges at Dog Gone Funny,Betsy-Katie-and suzie their dog.Got back to the parking area and ran into up side down party-Red Bird-Miss Mollie and Kyle just getting ready to head down the trail.Lenny/Kathy     <br/>
