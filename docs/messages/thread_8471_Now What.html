                    <div class="plaintext-content">Too complicated!  Find a stamp that applies to you.  Some folks just <br/>
print a fingerprint or sign a name for a bit before they actually <br/>
find a stamp that fits their nature.  One stamp I noticed yesterday <br/>
was actually a hole burned into the page (their name was something <br/>
like 'the Arsonists' or something--that wouldn't have worked in <br/>
yesterday's torrential downpour conditions in MD at the time but it <br/>
was noteworthy nonetheless). Other folks change out <br/>
their 'signature' or 'personal' stamp along the way as other <br/>
things/ideas come to mind or as they make major finds or reach major <br/>
milestones along the way (like finding 100 or 1,000 letterboxes).  <br/>
There really aren't any rules--it's up to your imagination.  Same <br/>
with the name, you could be 'ABC from Alexandria' or something more <br/>
exotic--find something you like or just be yourself!  It doesn't <br/>
matter.  Just remember to have fun and be careful along the way!  <br/>
See you on the letterboxing trail...<br/>

</p><p>First, you aren't "required" to make your own stamp. I letterboxed for months with a "store-bought" stamp and only recently made my own.
</p><p>Second, it seems that not everyone has a nickname. It's fun to have one but not "required." If you choose one, and another person has the same one, don't worry.

<br/>
Remember, this is suppossed to be a fun and exciting hobby. No stress involved. That is unless you cannot find that large rock that is hiding the box that you are out looking for. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Seriously though! You should have fun with it all, don't get stressed or pressured in any way to do ANYTHING. You do whatever you are comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not want to, or cannot, carve your own stamp, than by all means use a store bought, or custom made stamp (let me know if you need help carving or designing one, would be more than happy to help out).<br/>
<br/>
As far as the *codename* goes, that is totally up to you as well. There is no definitive requirement to have one, however many people do to simple personalize the sport more.<br/>
<br/>
I didn't catch your real name from your e-mail, but from your e-mail <br/>
(jkimball8@jglinc.com) I will assume (can be VERY dangerous to assume, but what the heck huh!)<br/>
that you name is....maybe.... J Kimball, or J Kim and you like 8 balls? Maybe...who knows but you right!<br/>
<br/>
If you do chose to go with a codename (nickname, or whatever you want to call it) maybe youcan use something like:<br/>
<br/>
1. an 8 ball with your initials surrounding it.<br/>
2. J.K. (or J Kim, or Kim) from Kansas (or where ever you are from)<br/>
3. J.K. Boxing (spin on J.K. Rowling of Harry Potter fame...LOL)<br/>
<br/>
The possiblities are really endless. If you do want to use a Non de plume, simply ask the group for help chosing one if you want. They really are a great bunch of people and VERY helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that all of this rambling on helps you out...<br/>
<br/>
Just let us know...<br/>
<br/>
P.S. If you travel internationally often, or maybe even once in a while...I HIGHLY ENCOURAGE you to plant boxes while on your country visits. I have a site that is an *attempt* to spread LetterBoxing to all corners of the globe. I would like to invite you to visit it and feel free to contribute. (www.GlobalLetterBoxing.org)<br/>

Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you on the trail :-)<br/>

<br/>
I am fairly new to this wonderful world also, having started last spring, and skipping alot of the sumer fun due to my sweetie who DETESTS deer flies and won't enter any area that they are remotely near.....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,,, I use my name and wondered if I should get an "alias", but decided not to.<br/>
I use a "pre made" stamp since when I started I just wanted to get out there and never took the time to do my own. But I probably will, once winter sets in and I have some free time....<br/>
<br/>
So in my opinion, (and I'm sure in everyone else's), just do what you feel, as long as you are safe and enjoying yourself!<br/>

retrospect now, I have no regrets about the stamp: I "earned" it from <br/>
Toys to Grow On catalog years ago for finding all the hidden mice in <br/>
the catalog, it was the first stamp I ever had, and the whimsical <br/>
position the mouse is in looks just like me running out the door <br/>
after my first box, like Bilbo without his handkerchief. My kids have <br/>
now decided to have their own stamps instead of one covering all. Two <br/>
have carved, but we bought for the 7 yr. old. (the other two and Dad <br/>
are in various stages of preparing to carve)<br/>
What I do regret is not getting a better stamp PAD. I've since <br/>
switched to a multicolor, and the prints are so much nicer looking. <br/>
Also, for the kids we got little artist sketch books, and they take <br/>
an image beautifully. Much better than mine.<br/>

I <br/>

Is <br/>

HELP <br/>
