A hitchhiker is a seperate stamp you will find in a letterbox.  Some <br/>
are very small, as in a flim container.  Others may be the size of a <br/>
regular box with log book stamp and pad in a seperate container.  <br/>
Upon finding one in a box you should take it with you to place in <br/>
another box.  You should check to make sure the stamp from the box <br/>
you found it in is stamped into the HH's log, stamp your stamp into <br/>
the log and the stamp of the box you move it to, a lot of stamping <br/>
going on.  Some HH's have special objectives like the Molly and <br/>
ginger boxes.  Molly is an east coast boxing doggie, Ginger is on the <br/>
west coast.  Each dogs owner relieased a box to find it's way to the <br/>
other dog.  Mollie's box recently found Ginger, Ginger's box is still <br/>
on it's way.  Most HH's just travel around.  There are a couple HH <br/>
hostels were you can allways find a HH.  If you visit a hostel feel <br/>
free to stamp into the HH there but if there's only one don't take it <br/>
unless you have one to drop off, if there's more than one it's OK to <br/>
take one.  They're like an added bonus, Swamp Yankee who hasn't <br/>
reliesed any HH's yet.<br/>

ok i have the concept of the hitchhiker....but is it JUST a stamp and <br/>
log book that is going around....or is it attached to an object like <br/>
say a stuffed animal or such???<br/>
<br/>
its not like ill ever find one around here...with my two boxes i <br/>
planted and the one other one someone planted downtown (which i think <br/>
is missing now)...its slim pickings here ;)<br/>
<br/>
so just wondering if attached to anything....<br/>
