                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just spent an absolutely wonderful weekend in the Hocking Hills <br/>
Region of Ohio.  It is a beautiful area, and the weather was just <br/>
wonderful.  The reason for this post is in hunting the letter boxes in <br/>
that region there seemed to be a very dominate name in box placement, <br/>
which was trailtracker.  I'd like to extend a thank you to them for all <br/>
of their time and effort in the thinking up, carving, hiding and <br/>
posting the 33 or so boxes they have listed for this area.  My family <br/>
and I had hours of fun letterboxing.  And not to offend anyone else <br/>
from the area that has placed boxes....... thank you too.  I just <br/>
wanted to acknowledge the significant effort by this boxer.  :-)  <br/>
