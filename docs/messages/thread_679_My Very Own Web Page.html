I've placed 4 boxes this summer but have only put clues out for one.  I was<br/>
hoping to do my own Web Page so that I didn't take anymore space up on the<br/>
Letterbox Site.  Does anyone have any advice for me as far as where I can go<br/>
(on the Web, an easy book, etc.) to learn how to do my own Page?<br/>

Nice to hear from you on the list again.  Can't wait to see the clues to your other boxes...<br/>
<br/>
You can find a bunch of places to start at http://dmoz.org/Computers/Internet/WWW/Authoring/Beginner%27s_Guides/<br/>
sorry I can't be more specific.  I uesed to use a really good online tutorial on the Web, but when my pc got upgraded I lost all my favorite links.<br/>
<br/>
What I have done to get a really fast start, is simply:<br/>
1. find a page i like on the web<br/>
2. righ-click on the page, and choose "view source"<br/>
3. Save the source code on my hard -drive<br/>
4. edit that code using notepad<br/>
5. you can view what it looks like w/ your internet browser<br/>
6. when your satisfied with your page, upload it to the net (AOL gives me space, I know there are places out there that give you free space, geocities, etc., but you'll probably have to put up with some advertising)  If you don't want to go that route, someone (including myself) will gladly volunteer some of their space.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  And I guess you might as well get in shape for Yosemite.  Wish I could get out there.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks so much for the direction.  I hope to get started this week.  My<br/>
carrier gives me space for my own web page so I'm all set, but thank you<br/>
very much for the offer.<br/>
<br/>
I've been walking 4 time/week for the past 3 weeks, so I'm getting in better<br/>
shape (though I can't tell yet).<br/>
<br/>
I finished another Raplica Page which I'll be sending off to you soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again,  Wendy<br/>

Thank you very much for the VERY Cool link.  I just went wondering through<br/>
and can see that it is a great reference and I am not at all intimidated. <br/>
