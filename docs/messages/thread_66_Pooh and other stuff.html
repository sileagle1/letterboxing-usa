<br/>
I think the letterboxing/pooh connection is good, but I foresee way many<br/>
problems that could be averted just by using a character of our own<br/>
design.  My 5 year old still enjoys Pooh, but Shannon is right, Wishbone<br/>
is MUCH cooler. Using an animal (may I suggest the cunning fox?) is a<br/>
good idea.  I kinda like the idea of using rubber stamp images on the<br/>
site, but I wonder if the medium might not be as effective as good old<br/>
illustration.  I offered my services before &amp; I'd be happy to offer<br/>
again.  I can provide samples of some of my illustrations if anyone<br/>
wants to e-mail me privately.<br/>
<br/>
Okay... that was far too much internet content discussion.... now on to<br/>
the fun part....<br/>
<br/>
Great job Mitch!!  Glad you found the latest additions.  Don't clean off<br/>
your shoes just yet... Rock Creek #2 may be placed today.  The stamp is<br/>
carved,the clues are written!!!<br/>
<br/>
P.S.   Christopher Robin, although he has cool stuffed animals, is a<br/>
wimp...<br/>
