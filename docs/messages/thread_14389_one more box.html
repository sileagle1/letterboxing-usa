However, I am pleased to report that the Nagog Hill box is alive and well. The only problem is that there is construction for who knows what going on literally on the other side of the stone walls that surround the park. The letterbox itself is maybe 5 yards from one of the outer walls of the conservation area, making the area where it is hidden highly visible to the workers. I ended up pretending I was having a picnic and sitting with my back to them, then pretending I dropped something in order to be able to get the box back where it belongs. It's a well-hidden box, but just keep an eye out. The only other problem with the Nagog Hill Conservation Area trails were the profusion of humongous bugs and horse poop every few feet along the trails due to the nearby stables, to the point where sometimes it was easier to walk just off the edge of the path than to dodge all the hot spots.<br/>
<br/>
I went to the trailhead of the LMS Kids box but bugs and humidity (along with a sunburn on my face from the morning) made me decide to come back another day. The same thing goes for the Haunted Trail box in Acton, plus on a gorgeous day like today, NARA Park (where the box is hidden) is swarming with swimmers and kids playing soccer.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, all in all I'd say that 4 finds and 3 exchanges is pretty good for my first time out. :)<br/>
I'm already at PFX15!<br/>
