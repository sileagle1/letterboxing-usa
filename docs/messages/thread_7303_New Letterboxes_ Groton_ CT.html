<br/>
The Thames River Lights Series<br/>
<br/>
The Thames River enters Long Island Sound between New London on the <br/>
west bank and Groton on the east.  The area is home to several <br/>
historic and beautiful lighthouses.<br/>
<br/>
Begin your hunt on the Groton side of the river, on the Avery point <br/>
campus of the University of CT.  Enter the campus through the main <br/>
gate and proceed to the gazebo.  From the gazebo a large willow bears <br/>
330 degrees.  At the base of the willow you have a beautiful view of <br/>
the New London Harbor Light on the western shore and the New London <br/>
Ledge Light to the south in the middle of the river.<br/>
<br/>
New London Harbor Light was built in 1760, the fourth light in the <br/>
newly established colonies.  In 1789 the first United States Congress <br/>
passed legislation placing its maintenance and control in the hands <br/>
of the newly created federal government.  Substantial renovation and <br/>
alterations were done in 1800, 1833, and 1855.  It remains an active <br/>
aid to navigation, a welcome beacon to many a returning submariner, <br/>
standing 89' above water with equal interval white, red sector every <br/>
6 seconds.  Range white 14 nautical miles, red 11 nm.<br/>
<br/>
To find the New London Harbor Light Letterbox, bear 350 degrees from <br/>
the willow to the corner of the retaining wall.  The box is hidden <br/>
among the boulders just to the left of the edge of the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Then walk along the gravel foot path that follows the water'e edge <br/>
south and east.  Pause at the observation platform for a view of <br/>
several more distant lighthouses.  On a clear day, at least 6 <br/>
lighthouses are visible from this point.  From east to west they are <br/>
Avery Point Light, Race Rock Light, North Dumpling Light, Little Gull <br/>
Light, New London Ledge Light, and New London Harbor Light.<br/>
<br/>
Continue walking to the south on the foot path until you can sit at <br/>
the base of a lighthouse.  This is Avery Point Light, built in 1943, <br/>
the youngest lighthouse in CT.  Built as a memorial to lighthouse <br/>
keepers, it was lit from 1944 to 1967 but never officially accepted <br/>
as an aid to navigation.  It needs substantial renovation.  Consider <br/>
buying a brick to help fund the restortation.<br/>

It's a great pleasure to welcome GreenHeron2200 to the letterboxing <br/>
community! GreenHeron is a mentor and inspiration to myself and many <br/>
colleagues as a Clinical Preceptor at Yale University. Without going <br/>
in to her nationally-recognized curriculum vitae, let me just say <br/>
that GH practices at the height of our profession (we're Nurse <br/>
Practitioners). No rich suburban Connecticut practice for GH. Working <br/>
with the neediest of underserved people, she has brilliantly mastered <br/>
combining the science of medicine with the art of healing. Seeing her <br/>
reach out to complicated patients with a healing touch and a <br/>
trademark twinkle in the eye is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, she loves lighthouses!<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, GreenHeron!<br/>
Jay in CT<br/>
