<br/>
As a geocacher who for the fun of it -- fascination with stamps but not <br/>
much more -- hybridizes his caches to hopefully increase traffic, from what <br/>
I undestand geocaching really only started up in May 3, 2000.<br/>
<br/>
<geocaching geek="" language="" on=""><br/>
<br/>
This was a couple of days after President Clinton removed the selective <br/>
availability for GPS units.  This automatically increased accuracy by <br/>
virtue of an increase in signal quality, not GPS unit quality.<br/>
<br/>
Before then, geocaching would have been extremely challenging; at best, <br/>
coordinates would have been a useful hint for letterboxing, since the <br/>
accuracy would have been the size of a football field.  Or maybe two, side <br/>
by side.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/about/credits.asp includes a brief history of the <br/>
sport.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone was geocaching before then, it wasn't too practical.  This and <br/>
the accuracy of 3 to 20 feet depending on the cost of your unit explains <br/>
the phenomenal growth in the past year.<br/>

I honestly dont get the point of geocaching, but then again I am a bit
of a Luddite (not too much of one since this is being composed on 
a computer).  I admit that I have not tried it.  But it seems
pretty simplistic- you walk until you hit the right spot and the numbers
are correct.  I have actually  made use of GPS data professionally
but I am not drawn to the sport.  I am sure that I over simplify and
I am not trying to start a flame war (if I wanted to do that I would have
posted on the Geocache list).  When GPS clues were first discussed
I remember suggesting that if it is a box with a stamp and clues to find
it then it  is a letterbox.  I think that both types of boxes
can exist.  My only fear is that GPS clues may come to predominate
in which case it may become neccessary to separate clues and discussion
of  the GPS boxes and the traditional boxes into two areas of cyberspace. 
Just my 2c.

Why do you think I like geocaching more?  It's easier than figuring out clues!<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I mainly upgrade my geocaches because of a fascination with <br/>
stamps -- any kinds, so all mine are commercially produced stamps of simple <br/>
designs I can make in less than half an hour on my computer -- and that it <br/>
might increase traffic. :)<br/>

<br/>
My first Geocache find had quite the vista.  I expect many others do as well.<br/>
<br/>
As for the art, beats geocaching every time.  Unless it's a hybrid <br/>
cache.  Like all or most of mine are and will be.<br/>
<br/>
Beat me on the sophistication level.<br/>
<br/>
As for the "simplicity" factor mentioned in a prior post, not all geocaches <br/>
are that easy to find.  Look for mine, and unless you're looking 12 feet up <br/>
you won't find it. You only know that if you decode the clue that says as <br/>
much.  Other than that it is admittedly easy to find.  My first find was <br/>
challenging to find since it was about 5 feet below "solid ground" -- a <br/>
very rocky area with piled rocks and you find the cache in one of the large <br/>
crevices between rocks and in a little cave.  It was an object lesson in <br/>
the warning that it sounds deceptively easy.<br/>

Tom's Sand Beach one this weekend.  I have to say that<br/>
I have become totally caught up in this and am so<br/>
excited to have found something that gets me outdoors<br/>
with my husband.  I would be really disappointed to<br/>
have to go the way of a GPS, rather than some of the<br/>
other fun ways of writing clues and finding the boxes.<br/>
 What are others thinking about this?  Linda (of Peter<br/>

<br/>
I mentioned it before, but I guess it deserves some emphasis. <br/>
Personally, I intend to use traditional clues even when I use GPS <br/>
clues. For example my two rock springs boxes are combo letterbox and <br/>
geocaching boxes. Traditional clues and GPS coordinates are available <br/>
for both boxes. Even with traditional clues there are variations, <br/>
some boxes out there rely heavily on compass skills others rely <br/>
heavily on the ability to solve difficult riddles and yet others <br/>
require some knowledge of history or local lore. There is no one <br/>
right way to do it. I do agree that I certainly wouldn't want <br/>
letterboxing to be just GPS clues (or any other approach), and as <br/>
long as everyone has the freedom to make their own clues however they <br/>
see fit I am confident that will never happen.<br/>

Thank you for this message, Susan.  Also, to Eric,<br/>
thank you for the clarification.  I feel a great sense<br/>
of relief.  Heck, maybe after awhile we will feel the<br/>
need to get into the electronics and give 'er a go!  I<br/>
have another question.  I have read a couple of times<br/>
about "trinkets" found in some letterboxes.  I know<br/>
that I should "wait and see what I find," but I am ADD<br/>
and have such a hard time with that!  ;-)  What sorts<br/>
of things are left for people to find?  I'd love to<br/>
include some treasures in the boxes that I plant, but<br/>
can't think of what they might be.... Also, somewhere<br/>
in my searchings, I have come across mentions of a<br/>
gathering....that sounds like fun..."who, what, when,<br/>
and where?"  Thanks again.  Linda<br/>
