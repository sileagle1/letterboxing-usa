THEY LIVE AND BREATHE LETTERBOXING<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AN OBSCURE GROUP OF INTREPID COLLECTORS GIVE THIS ENGLISH VERSION OF <br/>
ORIENTEERING THEIR HEARTY STAMP OF APPROVAL<br/>
<br/>
ADRIAN WILLIAMS IS AN ENGLISHMAN WITH A MISSION you might call an <br/>
obsession: to find plastic containers that are hidden under rocks. He <br/>
is in his early 40s, and carries on with a bluff manner and <br/>
considerable energy. He has worked as a garage manager, a nurse and a <br/>
Web-page designer but devotes his free time almost entirely to this <br/>
pursuit. The hidden containers-they're known as letterboxes-are <br/>
scattered through the wild country of Dartmoor National Park, a vast <br/>
region of high, barren hills in the southwestern English county of <br/>
Devon. Adrian is one of several thousand people who have taken up the <br/>
search for them. He told me that when he moved from London to Devon a <br/>
few years ago, he'd never heard of letterboxing. Now, whenever he <br/>
can, he leaves home early to get to the moor, comes back late and <br/>
spends his evenings on the phone talking shop with other "boxers," or <br/>
entering new clues into his computer database. "I live and breathe <br/>
letterboxing," Adrian said. "It's a way of life for me, and I'm not <br/>
the only one." Letterboxing is something between a sport and a hobby, <br/>
sort of a combination of orienteering (Smithsonian, June 1992) and <br/>
treasure hunting that consists of using maps, clues and compasses in <br/>
the search for containers. Each letterbox contains a notebook and a <br/>
unique rubber stamp. Each letterboxer carries a notebook and a personal stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Once a box is found, a small ritual called "stamping up" is <br/>
performed. The letterboxer inks the stamp from the box and presses it <br/>
into his own notebook, then inks his personal stamp and presses that <br/>
into the little visitors' book that's kept in the box. It's double <br/>
proof that he's found the box. The stamp copy he takes home is the <br/>
reward for his effort. Then the letterboxer reseals the box, replaces <br/>
it in its hiding place, checks the clue sheet and the compass <br/>
bearings, and heads off in search of the next letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
There are thousands of boxes hidden on Dartmoor. They've been put out <br/>
a few at a time by letterboxers themselves. The whole thing goes on <br/>
without any governing body or official sanction. It came into being <br/>
spontaneously, and it's the people who participate that keep it <br/>
going. Anyone can go letterboxing, any day of the year.<br/>
<br/>
Adrian, his wife, Melissa, and their children, 11-year-old Tegan and <br/>
8-year-old Ben, were heading out one Saturday last November, and they <br/>
invited me along. On our way from the Williamses' house, in the town <br/>
of Okehampton, to Dartmoor, we drove down lanes in the Devon farm <br/>
country so narrow that ferns growing out of the stone walls brushed <br/>
against both sides of the car. We eventually went through a gate, <br/>
followed a track to the edge of the moor, where we parked, and <br/>
started hiking up a boulder-strewn hillside. Some shaggy cattle <br/>
ambled off before us.<br/>
<br/>
Adrian said that when he gets in a new place, it takes a little while <br/>
for him to get a feel for where things are and how to interpret the <br/>
clues. Before long, he announced that we were in an area that was <br/>
heavily salted with letterboxes. (It should be pointed out, however, <br/>
that someone who was not looking for them could hike on this hill for <br/>
years and never see a letterbox.) He read from a set of clues: "Hut <br/>
at 113 degrees. Cairn at 108 degrees." He looked around and located <br/>
what he thought were the hut and cairn referred to in the clue. The <br/>
cairn was just a hundred yards up the hill; the hut was more than a mile away.<br/>
<br/>
Adrian judged where he would have to put himself so that his compass <br/>
readings to those two landmarks would match the ones specified in the <br/>
clue. "Should be just over that way," he ventured. Melissa had a <br/>
somewhat different idea about where those bearings would cross, but <br/>
she only rolled her eyes and said to me in an undertone: "How many <br/>
letterboxers have divorced over a difference in bearings on Dartmoor?"<br/>
<br/>
In a couple of minutes, Melissa pulled the box from under a rock, and <br/>
we all settled on our haunches to stamp up. Most letterboxes are <br/>
actually pill bottles-plastic screw-top containers, about three <br/>
inches in diameter by four inches high, that were originally used to <br/>
supply pharmacists with wholesale quantities of pills. These are <br/>
weatherproof, plentiful and free for the asking. We had our first box <br/>
of the day, and Adrian announced, "We're off. Now we're in form."<br/>
<br/>
The British are known for eccentricity, but letterboxers, one <br/>
aficionado told me not long before I went afield with the Williamses, <br/>
are the greatest eccentrics of all. They trace their curious pastime <br/>
back to 1854, when a Victor-ian gentleman walker put his calling card <br/>
in a bottle and stuck the bottle into a bank at Cranmere Pool in a <br/>
remote part of Dartmoor. Other walkers who found the bottle also left <br/>
their cards, and perhaps a postcard that the next walker could carry <br/>
off the moor and send back to its owner. In 1894, a letterbox <br/>
appeared at Belstone Tor. (A "tor" is a hill marked by a rocky <br/>
outcropping. There are about 140 on Dartmoor.) In 1938, another was <br/>
placed at Ducks' Pool.<br/>
<br/>
As late as the 1970s, there were only a few dozen letterboxes on <br/>
Dartmoor, though by then rubber stamps had replaced calling cards and <br/>
postcards. In the past couple of decades, the number of boxes has <br/>
exploded, while at the same time boxers have tried to keep the whole <br/>
thing quiet. Most letterboxers live in Devon, though some come from <br/>
other parts of England and a few even come from other parts of the world.<br/>
<br/>
With the exception of a compass and the rubber stamps, there is <br/>
refreshingly little gear to buy. The only "currency" is the clue <br/>
sheets that lead to newly placed boxes-the owner can exchange these <br/>
for clue sheets leading to other people's boxes. An organization <br/>
called the 100 Club publishes a catalogue of some of the letterbox <br/>
clues. These clues don't exactly pave the way to the letterboxes. <br/>
Here are a couple I picked at random from the catalogue:<br/>
<br/>
"Favourite Lunch Spots No. 22. Shapley Tor. Lone tree by road 312 <br/>
degrees. Huge square boulder 346 1/2 degrees. Hut circle 277 1/2 degrees."<br/>
<br/>
"Reynard's Happy Hour. Bellever 341 degrees. Hay Tor 51 degrees. <br/>
Track disappears over hill 101 degrees. Under large rock half covered <br/>
with heather."<br/>
<br/>
And just to spice things up, some clues include cryptic references, <br/>
or come in the form of anagrams. The 100 Club sells patches that <br/>
advertise that the wearer has found 100 boxes, 500 boxes and so on.<br/>
<br/>
The rubber stamps used in letterboxing have become increasingly (and <br/>
competitively) elaborate. Many boxers put out series of stamps that <br/>
commemorate some aspect of Dartmoor. Adrian has just put out a series <br/>
on places with local bird names, called "Dartmoor Most Fowl." Roger <br/>
and Stephanie Paul of Denbury have put out a series called "Dartmoor <br/>
Farmers, Past and Present." Some artistically inclined boxers carve <br/>
their own stamps out of rubber blocks; these "handcuts" are <br/>
especially sought after.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Adrian and Melissa had found that first box, we'd come <br/>
well up the hill. Looking back, I could see the green and hedged farm <br/>
country just below us. Farther off was the city of Plymouth and the <br/>
entrance to Plymouth Harbor. As I watched, the distant mist rose, <br/>
revealing a silvery sheen on the water of the English Channel. The <br/>
clouds above it looked ominous.<br/>
<br/>
But the sun was shining where we were. It was a good area, and there <br/>
were boxes to find. We worked our way to the top of Stalldown Barrow, <br/>
picking up five or six more boxes in the next hour. Only once did we <br/>
see another walker, several hundred yards off. Adrian guessed that <br/>
she was a letterboxer; she veered away when she saw us.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, letterboxers seldom cross paths out on the moor, though the <br/>
keen ones get to know each other nonetheless. When they find a box, <br/>
they look to see whose personal stamps are already in the notebook. <br/>
Being first in the visitors' book carries high prestige. Though they <br/>
may never meet or even know each other's real names, the regular <br/>
group all know each other by the nicknames on their "personals," <br/>
which often include a play on the boxer's name or hometown: the <br/>
"Topsham Torists," the "Dartmoor Carter-pillar," the "Plymstock Soggy <br/>
Soxers." The Williamses' personal reads "Have Feet Will Travel."<br/>
<br/>
The typical letterboxers are probably a family with children who have <br/>
gotten their hands on the 100 Club's catalogue and have trekked out <br/>
to the moor with a compass and a picnic lunch for a day of fresh air <br/>
and adventure. But a small group of the keenest boxers also go after <br/>
"word-of-mouth" boxes. These are letterboxes that aren't mentioned in <br/>
the catalogue and whose owners circulate the clues only to other insiders.<br/>
<br/>
A strict protocol applies to clue exchange. One never asks for <br/>
another's clues. You can offer your clues, but only if you've been <br/>
around long enough to have the idea that your clues will be accepted. <br/>
The exchange of clues often starts at the pub and continues by mail. <br/>
Adrian checked the clue sheet we were using that day, and said that <br/>
we should head over to the northern side of Stalldown Barrow and down <br/>
into the valley.<br/>
<br/>
As we walked, we could see a row of standing stones left by <br/>
prehistoric people. Some of the ponies that wander free on Dartmoor <br/>
had worked their way among the stones, and from where we were, clumps <br/>
of ponies and the standing stones alternated across the horizon. We <br/>
walked on till we came to the steep slope on the far side of <br/>
Stalldown Barrow. The River Erme snaked through the valley at our <br/>
feet. A "tail" of white water marked each boulder in the river. Up <br/>
the mottled slope on the far side of the river, more than a mile <br/>
away, we could see a farmer on an all-terrain vehicle herding sheep. <br/>
With the help of a pair of energetic Border collies, he gathered the <br/>
sheep toward the corner of an ancient stone wall. We could just hear <br/>
his shouts to his dogs, and the sheep, which had been scattered <br/>
specks on the hillside, coalesced into pools of white with tributary streams.<br/>
<br/>
But we weren't there for sight-seeing-there were boxes to find. We <br/>
slogged our way down the hill (Dartmoor is almost uniformly wet <br/>
underfoot) to a rocky gully called Smuggler's Hole. It was another <br/>
rich area for letterboxes. Adrian and Melissa found a couple of boxes <br/>
by using clues. Tegan found a couple just by looking. "That's two to <br/>
Tegan," Adrian called. "Come on, Ben, you're lagging." Adrian checked <br/>
through the notebook that he'd taken from one of the boxes we'd <br/>
found. He recognized all the stamps.<br/>
<br/>
"It's the usual gang," he said. Then, using the felt-tip markers he <br/>
had brought for just this purpose, Adrian spent a good ten minutes <br/>
coloring this stamp-it was a picture of a swashbuckling smuggler-so <br/>
that he would have a particularly attractive copy for his collection. <br/>
Some of the more serious letterboxers like to take copies of stamps <br/>
on note cards, which they later sort and mount in binders. "When you <br/>
look at your collection of stamps on a winter's evening," Adrian <br/>
said, "it gives you something to remember: who you were with, and how <br/>
you found it." We got a few more stamps in the gully before the storm <br/>
that I'd seen earlier out on the English Channel broke over the top <br/>
of Stalldown Barrow. Gusts of rain started to lash us. Even Adrian, <br/>
who had told me earlier that a letterboxer's unfailing motto is "Just <br/>
one more box," admitted that it was time to quit. We pulled up our <br/>
hoods, put our heads down to the storm and followed a trail along the <br/>
River Erme back to the car.<br/>
<br/>
Once in the car, Adrian and Melissa looked through the stamps we'd <br/>
collected, a total of 20. They included pictures of a fox peering <br/>
from its den, a row of standing stones (a handcut), three different <br/>
versions of smugglers and a female short-eared owl. There was also a <br/>
stamp commemorating Her Majesty's Customs and Excise service; it was <br/>
found in a letterbox hidden under a rock overlooking Smuggler's Hole. <br/>
The verdict on the day? Not bad.<br/>
<br/>
Pat Clatworthy has collected thousands of stamps in her 18 years of <br/>
boxing, though she goes out only on weekends. Pat is a trim, vigorous <br/>
woman of youthful middle age who works for the emergency-preparedness <br/>
office of the Devon County Council. She agreed to take me out one day <br/>
in sunny weather that contradicted Dartmoor's reputation for rain and gloom.<br/>
<br/>
Pat started off at a brisk pace, providing a commentary over her <br/>
shoulder as she walked. "Letterboxing seems to satisfy a lot of human <br/>
traits," she said. "It gives a sense of adventure, a sense of <br/>
achievement and satisfaction to collectors. You're pitting your wits <br/>
against someone else's. And it's a great leveler: you'll see a doctor <br/>
out talking over clues with a Boy Scout. I think it's good for the <br/>
Boy Scout, and it's especially good for the doctor."<br/>
<br/>
We passed Nun's Cross Farm, one of the old Dartmoor farms that's been <br/>
abandoned this century, a victim of the poor, acidic soil and the <br/>
harsh climate. Using the stone cross and a fir tree for bearings, Pat <br/>
soon located a box. With the alacrity that comes of long practice, <br/>
she unloaded her pack for the stamping up: a plastic pad to sit on; <br/>
two plastic containers filled with cards, ink pads, markers and her <br/>
personal; a notebook wrapped in a plastic bag; and a thermos of tea.<br/>
<br/>
"Coming out for a day of letterboxing is like planning a battle <br/>
campaign," Pat said. "I'd feel lost without my pack of gear." (Pat is <br/>
also a World War II buff.) Her other crucial piece of equipment is a <br/>
golf club handle minus the head. She uses it to probe for boxes under <br/>
rocks and in mossy banks, and as a walking stick. She pokes ground <br/>
that looks soft before she steps. "It stops you from walking into <br/>
suspect bits," she said.<br/>
<br/>
We rambled on for several miles, finding boxes here and there, until <br/>
we reached Ducks' Pool, the second-most- famous site on Dartmoor <br/>
after Cranmere Pool. At neither of these locations is there a pool, <br/>
nor much of anything to distinguish the area from the miles of <br/>
surrounding grassland, other than its letterboxing history. These are <br/>
the sites of the two letterboxes that are shown on the map of <br/>
Dartmoor. And on the ground, small monuments make the letterboxes <br/>
impossible to miss.<br/>
<br/>
Plenty of people around Dartmoor think these should be the only two <br/>
letterboxes. The very eccentricity of letterboxing seems to breed <br/>
suspicion among people who don't participate. This comes out, partly, <br/>
in accusations that letterboxers trample vegetation and disturb <br/>
antiquities. For their part, park officials have responded by <br/>
consulting with boxers and publishing a code of conduct-which seems <br/>
to be well heeded. I noticed that boxers don't mind pointing to the <br/>
damage done by foxhunters and trail riders. The horseback riders <br/>
point at mountain bikers and hang gliders.<br/>
<br/>
The farmers who have rights to the common grazing land on Dartmoor <br/>
(they're called "commoners") worry about recreational users <br/>
disturbing their livestock. Few people seem happy about the presence <br/>
of the military, which trains regularly on Dartmoor. A park ranger I <br/>
talked to said that a big part of his job is balancing the claims of <br/>
various users-a job made somewhat trickier by the fact that the land <br/>
within park boundaries in Britain remains in private ownership. I <br/>
heard a cockeyed rumor in a pub one night that the Prince of Wales, <br/>
who is the largest landowner on Dartmoor, wishes that the whole place <br/>
would become a strict nature preserve. I quickly got the impression <br/>
that whichever group of users was looking at Dartmoor could see very <br/>
clearly the damage-real or supposed-that every other group was <br/>
causing. It was not long before I got a taste of this myself.<br/>
<br/>
Using compass bearings, Pat and I came to Ducks' Pool across an <br/>
unmarked grassy plain. We hadn't seen another person for hours, but <br/>
as we approached we saw a man coming from the other direction, <br/>
apparently also making for Ducks' Pool. I hung back a bit, to observe <br/>
this meeting. Pat kept to her own business, avoiding conversation. I <br/>
finally came up and the man hailed me cheerily. He looked to be about <br/>
60, and had a rosy complexion and white hair. He told me that he'd <br/>
just walked eight miles, and there was sweat on his brow to prove it. <br/>
"This your first time here?" he asked. Well, that's a friendly <br/>
opening, I thought, but I had misjudged my man. He turned out to be <br/>
an anti-letterboxer on the lookout for a victim. I had walked into his trap.<br/>
<br/>
"Look at this photo." He thrust it under my nose. It showed three <br/>
young women having a picnic by the Ducks' Pool rock. "This was taken <br/>
in 1957. Look at the erosion that's been caused by letterboxers since <br/>
then. The ground around the rock was way up here, then. Look what's <br/>
been lost!" Pat started to say something about natural erosion, but <br/>
the man would have none of it, and continued his harangue. Finally, <br/>
he seemed to have judged that he had browbeaten us into submission. <br/>
He glanced at his watch. "Twelve miles to go," he said. "I'd better <br/>
be off if I'm going to make it home by teatime." And away he strode <br/>
over the hill.<br/>
<br/>
Even though letterboxers tend to avoid each other on the moor, a <br/>
group of them congregates every Wednesday evening at the Dolphin <br/>
Hotel in the town of Bovey Tracey. It's a friendly, noisy gathering, <br/>
and a good place to hear letterboxing stories. I met Godfrey <br/>
Swinscow, who seems to be the unofficial godfather of modern-day <br/>
letterboxers. He told me that he'd found his first box in 1935. <br/>
"Letterboxing is better than watching the telly," Godfrey told me. <br/>
"It keeps the boys out of the pub, and the girls from chasing the <br/>
boys." Not that Godfrey minds some good fun. I heard about a <br/>
practical joke that some still-undiscovered boxers once played on <br/>
him. He went out one day on the promise of finding a new box with an <br/>
especially nice stamp. Along the way, he collected a series of notes <br/>
with progressively outlandish directions. Being a good sport, he <br/>
followed the directions until eventually he ended up walking across <br/>
the moor, dressed in a frock and bonnet, chant-ing, "I believe in <br/>
fairies and pixies."<br/>
<br/>
I heard about the boxer who had let it be known that he was planning <br/>
to set out a new box at a certain spot at midnight on New Year's Eve. <br/>
When he got to his spot, 45 minutes late, he came upon three cars <br/>
full of cold, impatient letterboxers waiting in the dark for the <br/>
chance to be first in the book.<br/>
<br/>
Chris Jones told me that he thought there were maybe 60 to 100 <br/>
"hard-core" letterboxers. "A lot of other people do it for their <br/>
kids," he said. "That's fine. I won't decry that." But only a <br/>
hard-core boxer would put himself in the position that Chris did one <br/>
day. He needed two more boxes to complete a series and found himself <br/>
on the wrong side of a river on a day when the rain was "bucketing" <br/>
down. He and his partner walked along the riverbank for a mile, <br/>
looking for a place to cross. "The river was in full spate, really <br/>
flowing," he recalled. "Finally we just waded in, went up to our <br/>
thighs. As wet as we were, what had we to lose? And how would we ever <br/>
live it down if it got around that we were beaten by a little bad weather?"<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, Pat Clatworthy had presented me with a North Dartmoor <br/>
Official Passport, a whimsical document that ensured my protection <br/>
from "Pixies and many other obscurities." In spite of that small <br/>
honor, I got the feeling people in the pub were keeping an eye on me, <br/>
not in any hostile way but out of a concern that my presence might <br/>
foretell the arrival of crowds of heavy-footed "grockles"-a word from <br/>
Devon for people who aren't.<br/>
<br/>
A day later, I was alone on the moor, a clue sheet (solemnly lent to <br/>
me by Adrian) in one hand, the map of Dartmoor (it measures <br/>
approximately three by four feet when unfolded) in the other. I <br/>
checked the sheet and found a set of clues that started from the <br/>
eastern corner of the abandoned Doe Tor Farm. I located the farm on <br/>
the map, hiked up there and read the clues.<br/>
<br/>
"Go 132 paces on 107 degrees to tree." I aligned the compass with <br/>
north, took a sighting on 107 degrees, and there was a gnarled <br/>
hawthorn tree. My spirits rose. Adrian had warned me that "paces" is <br/>
a notoriously subjective unit of measure, but 132 of my paces brought <br/>
me to within a few feet of the hawthorn. I felt like a child playing <br/>
find-the-thimble when everyone starts shouting, "Warmer, warmer!" <br/>
Last clue: "Box is 12 paces from tree on 280 degrees in clitter" (a <br/>
Devon word for a jumble of broken rocks). Standing next to the tree, <br/>
I used the compass to find 280 degrees, took 12 steps in that <br/>
direction and looked down. My eye caught a hint of something <br/>
man-made-the box. I took a copy of the stamp. My first solo letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
Then I checked the clue sheet and found one of Adrian's boxes listed. <br/>
I knew he'd be pleased if I stamped his book, so I decided to try for <br/>
it. Here is the clue, verbatim: "Dartmoor's Lost Unicorns No. 5-Hero, <br/>
5377, 8473, Have Feet Will Travel, FP 205 degrees. Cross 181/2 <br/>
degrees. Large chimney on farm 241 degrees. Tip of dead tree 3151/2 <br/>
degrees. Tip of pointed rock 70 degrees and 9p away. Under rock on <br/>
edge of clitter." The name of the stamp comes first: Dartmoor's Lost <br/>
Unicorn No. 5-Hero. Adrian's code name is Have Feet Will Travel. The <br/>
two four-digit numbers, 5377 and 8473, are the map-grid references; <br/>
using them, I got myself into the right neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
Once I was in the right neighborhood, the stone cross on Brat Tor was <br/>
the most obvious landmark. Again aligning my compass with north, I <br/>
walked across a hill 40 or 50 feet until the cross bore on 181/2 <br/>
degrees. Now I had a line from me to the cross and beyond. I knew <br/>
that the box had to be somewhere along that line. To find it, I <br/>
needed to determine where another bearing in the clue crossed the <br/>
line. I knew that "FP" stood for flagpole. I looked in the direction <br/>
of 205 degrees and saw some vague smudges in the distance that might <br/>
have been flagpoles. Or might not. I decided to try another landmark. <br/>
"Tip of dead tree 3151/2 degrees." I could see a cluster of trees <br/>
around Doe Tor Farm a mile or so to the north, and one of them looked <br/>
dead. I walked several hundred yards downhill, all the while keeping <br/>
the cross on 181/2 degrees until the dead tree was on 315 degrees. <br/>
Good. I was standing at the intersection of those two bearings. The <br/>
only trouble was, I was out in the middle of a grassy area, far from <br/>
the edge of clitter. Obviously, I had picked out the wrong dead tree. <br/>
Back to the clues.<br/>
<br/>
"Large chimney on farm 241 degrees." I peered in the direction of 241 <br/>
degrees. Ahh! Miles away, almost lost in mist, was a blocky shape <br/>
that might have been a farmhouse. I couldn't make out a chimney, but <br/>
this was the only possible choice. To put that farm on 241 degrees, I <br/>
had to walk back uphill. That would return me to the clitter, which <br/>
was good, but it would leave my precious dead tree way off the mark.<br/>
<br/>
I walked up the hill, using the compass to check the stone cross and <br/>
the farmhouse until I thought I was at the spot where their bearings <br/>
crossed. I looked for a dead tree somewhere around 315 degrees. There <br/>
were a couple of trees in the distance on the far bank of the River <br/>
Lyd, but neither of them was close to 315 degrees, and neither <br/>
appeared to be dead. So, what about that other clue-the pointed rock <br/>
nine paces away on 70 degrees? I was surrounded by pointed rocks; it <br/>
was the Times Square of pointed rocks. But as I was looking around, I <br/>
saw, maybe ten feet away, a five-foot-tall dead tree. Adrian, you <br/>
crafty bloke! Two steps put it on 315 degrees. A few minutes later, I <br/>
pulled out the letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn't find the next two boxes at all, but then I got two in <br/>
quick succession. The next one would have taken me back up Doe Tor. <br/>
By then the sky was getting "dimpsey"-another of those Devon words. I <br/>
hadn't seen a soul in many hours, and no one in the world had a clue <br/>
where I was. I gave up the idea of "one more box" and started back. <br/>
Pausing on the side of High Down, I looked across the valley. It was <br/>
a bleak, empty scene. As I stood there, a gibbous moon came over the <br/>
shoulder of Doe Tor.<br/>
<br/>
I had been out with Adrian near Doe Tor a few days earlier. We had <br/>
stopped for lunch on the side of a hill called Great Kneeset. Through <br/>
a notch on the horizon between Lints Tor and Black Tor we could see a <br/>
bit of the lowland England where people live and work. "People down <br/>
there, busy, busy, busy, rushing around," Adrian mused. What we could <br/>
see of Dartmoor, on the other hand, was empty but for the two of us.<br/>
<br/>
For millennia, the wet bleakness had kept people away. Traces of the <br/>
few who had ventured onto the moor were still visible: the tinners <br/>
had left piles of tailings; farmers had left stone walls; soldiers <br/>
had left some rough roads and bomb craters; religious people had left <br/>
standing stones and carved crosses. And, of course, letterboxers had <br/>
been there, too. By then I knew that out in the wild country before <br/>
us were thousands of pill bottles hidden under rocks. "It's a funny <br/>
world," Adrian said, "isn't it."<br/>
