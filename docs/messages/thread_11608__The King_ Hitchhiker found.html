on the Mercer Hunt to find the Blue Star and Crimson Cat and to my <br/>
surprise found my 1st HH.  "The King", a beautiful carving of a <br/>
kingfisher will now be journeying a few hundred miles back to my home <br/>
state of CT to be placed somewhere?????  <br/>
<br/>
I'll admit that I am completely new to all this, last weekend was my <br/>
first outing and I picked up four boxes in CT.  (A big thank you to <br/>
DD for bringing me out and introducing me to all this...)  This <br/>
weekend was my 2nd outing, to bring my grand total to 6 boxes <br/>
(veterans please stop giggling...) and I found this HH on my 5th box <br/>
at the Blue Star...<br/>
<br/>
So, where will he go?  Since, I've collected so few boxes, my options <br/>
for placing The King here in CT are limitless... I'll try to get out <br/>
this coming weekend to put this gorgeous hand carved stamp back out <br/>
in circulation!<br/>

(PS just saw the notes about the letterbox_travellers group.  Will <br/>
post this info there also.  Hate to be repetitive, but I guess better <br/>
than not posting the info at all!)<br/>
