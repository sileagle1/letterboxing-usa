&gt; Hello all:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been watching the postings for a while now, and thought it wise to<br/>
&gt; post an intro before asking advice! %^)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My name is Kate and I live near San Francisco (in Emeryville, which is a<br/>
&gt; small burb squished between Berkeley &amp; Oakland), and am fascinated with<br/>
&gt; letterboxing. I've been designing personal stamps for myself for a coupla<br/>
&gt; years now, and I'm excited about meeting others with the same interest. The<br/>
&gt; list has already been helpful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's my question:<br/>
&gt; I'm interested in setting up a local letterboxing event(s?) for Emeryville.<br/>
&gt; Maybe hosting a stamp-making session and general letter-boxing overview<br/>
&gt; (talk about the history, process, etc.) at first, then having a day or<br/>
&gt; week-long event for the actual seek &amp; stamp. Has anyone set up this type of<br/>
&gt; event? Are there any tips or resources I can use? Any words of advice? And<br/>
&gt; (most important) as a novice, is a structured event like this in keeping<br/>
&gt; with the spirit of letterboxing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me know; I'd like to have something put together for the fall.<br/>
&gt; Thanks in advance,<br/>

Kate:<br/>
First, welcome aboard! I assume you've seen Linda Aplin's Calif. clues,<br/>
at the Calif map at: http://www.pclink.com/elf/letbox.htm<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I assume you've seen the Smithsonian letterboxing article -<br/>
there is an excerpt from it on the Letterbox pages, but the full article<br/>
tells lots more. April 1998.<br/>
<br/>
Next, Eric is correct in his comments about letterbox "rules", etc. We<br/>
started with the Dartmoor examples as a model, but soon realized that<br/>
the US is a big place to establish this, and we really have the liberty<br/>
to develop our own tradition, format, and activities.  <br/>
<br/>
There are examples of "charity walks" in Dartmoor, set up to benefit<br/>
some non-profit entity. Participants purchase clue sheets and hund the<br/>
stamps. At the close of the event, the boxs are removed. Thus, the stamp<br/>
impressions are limited in number, and thus perhaps "collectible".<br/>
Obviously, these depend upon a population that knows about letterboxing<br/>
in the first place. So, the only way to grow the hobby is to keep<br/>
finding ways to get others interested.<br/>
<br/>
My tactic here in VT is to first, get enough letterboxess out so that<br/>
individuals who become interested will have something to look for. We<br/>
have about a dozen,  and, with Spring finally arriving, the number will<br/>
grow.   <br/>
<br/>
I'd say, Go For It! I don't think what you suggest has been done yet in<br/>
the US, but, we are all newbies, in a sense. Is there an event that you<br/>
can tag on to, like a rubber-stamp convention, a weekend hobby-course<br/>
venue, etc? I think providing some basic help in stamp carving,<br/>
letterbox materials choices, and what to put in the box, would be great<br/>
if you can genetate enough interest.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the "Getting Started" part of the etterbox-USA web site has lots if<br/>
info you can use.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!  <br/>

<br/>
Hi Kate, welcome.  Everyone here is fascinated with letterboxing.  Some<br/>
of<br/>
us don't know why nor do we care.  It just seems like a whole lot of<br/>
fun.<br/>
My name is Dan Servatius.  I'm from St. Paul, MN and I'm one of the<br/>
people<br/>
who hosts this talk list.  Some people refer to me as the list manager,<br/>
but really, its a group effort.  I think I probably play manager more<br/>
than<br/>
the others, so OK.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; I've been designing personal stamps for myself for a coupla<br/>
 &gt; years now, and I'm excited about meeting others with the same<br/>
 &gt; interest. The list has already been helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Good, its good to hear that it does that - that its effective/helpful.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; Here's my question:<br/>
 &gt; I'm interested in setting up a local letterboxing event(s?) for<br/>
Emeryville.<br/>
 &gt; Maybe hosting a stamp-making session and general letter-boxing<br/>
overview<br/>
 &gt; (talk about the history, process, etc.) at first, then having a day<br/>
or<br/>
 &gt; week-long event for the actual seek &amp; stamp. Has anyone set up this<br/>
type of<br/>
 &gt; event?<br/>
<br/>
Not that I know about.  I think you may be the first.  But I have been<br/>
seeing<br/>
more inquiries lately about setting up such events so I would not be<br/>
surprised<br/>
if some events are being set up concurrent with your event.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; Are there any tips or resources I can use? Any words of advice? And<br/>
 &gt; (most important) as a novice, is a structured event like this in<br/>
keeping<br/>
 &gt; with the spirit of letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
Yes, by all means, a bunch of people getting together for a letterboxing<br/>
event is very much in the spirit.  A few people on our list have had the<br/>
opportunity to meet each other.  I met Mitch Klink and Thom Cheney in<br/>
Portland while visiting my son out there last year.  We didn't have time<br/>
to <br/>
plan a boxing excursion, but I did hunt a couple of their letterboxes<br/>
while<br/>
there and we met at the local pub afterward for a couple of beers and to<br/>
"stamp up" each other's log books.<br/>
<br/>
 &gt; Let me know; I'd like to have something put together for the fall.<br/>
<br/>
Well, my basic thought is it may work to put up some flyers around your<br/>
neigborhood.  Leave your email address or phone number so they can<br/>
contact somebody for more information.<br/>
If you want to use our web address feel free, its<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf<br/>
You may want to suggest that they send an email to <br/>
mailto:der-mad-stamper@egroups.com.  That's Mitch Klink.  He will set up<br/>
(or<br/>
tell you how to join) a local talk list for California or San Fran. <br/>
Really,<br/>
our current list is so small though, you may want to just stick with it<br/>
for<br/>
now.  You can also give them info right on your flyer how to join this<br/>
list.<br/>
If you want to do it that way send them to<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/mail.htm<br/>
And then keep us apprised on the list and don't be afraid to ask<br/>
questions.<br/>
Some people here know a lot about stamps and art.  Other people know a<br/>
lot<br/>
about setting up web info.  Others know a little bit about everything.<br/>
<br/>
So those are my suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I have a welcome wagon list at home and will try to remember to forward<br/>
that<br/>
to you later on.  I'm at work now and do not have access to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Again, weclome and feel free to ask questions.  Somebody will answer. <br/>
They <br/>
always do, and sometimes several people answer.<br/>

Hi Kate &amp; JDE,<br/>
<br/>
I've been really, really busy at work and have time to read occasional emails without participating. I feel like a peeping tom--but my projects are finished and maybe I can regain a little bit of my life before I go away on vacation next week.<br/>
<br/>
Kate, I'm in Palo Alto and have placed 3 boxes in a local park.  It will be great to have more letterboxing activity in California--for a state with so many people, we've had very poor participation.<br/>
<br/>
JDE, if you're coming out to California in July I'll have to place more boxes. The Bol Park boxes are beginner boxes--easy to get to and easy to find. I love a deadline--when are you coming to the Bay Area? If Kate gets boxes placed by then, perhaps you would be interested in hunting together?<br/>
<br/>
Linda<br/>

&gt;Great Ideas!  &gt;<br/>
&gt;From a selfish perspective, I'm really looking forward to more activity in &gt;the SF area.  Yesterday, I booked a business trip to LA and SF in July.  Had &gt;planned on checking on the Circle X box in LA, and hunt for the Bol Park boxes closer &gt;to you, and now I see that thanks to you there may be even more activity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would heed Erik's advice about putting out a some boxes 1st so that &gt;people in your area who may be interested will have something to hunt for and get a &gt;taste for the hobby.  &gt;<br/>
&gt;Who knows, maybe I'll bring a box with me and plant it in the Bay area.  &gt;Might even put it up for adoption.  For some reason, it seems easier for me to &gt;plant boxes on the Left Coast:)) than in my own neck of the woods (Some day Randy!  I &gt;just can't tell you when).  I guess I oughta think about that a little and see &gt;why this is so.<br/>

What spirit!  I feel like a bit of a curmudgeon compared to you.<br/>
I'm setting here waiting for a big wave of letterboxes to descend<br/>
upon my neigborhood.  I'm churning out one or two stamps every 6<br/>
months or so.  I better get busy.  I have 3 baseball symbols drawn<br/>
and I will do a 4th.  The diamond will be the first stamp (quite<br/>
large) and each of the other four stamps will fit inside the <br/>
bases - 1st, 2nd, 3rd &amp; Home.  The first letterbox will have<br/>
cards in it large enough to hold the diamond stamp just in case<br/>
the hunter's log book cannot fit the large stamp on its pages.  <br/>
Is 4 inches square too large of a stamp to ink?  Can you angle it<br/>
from several directions on the pad if its too large?  I think I'll<br/>
have to experiment with it.<br/>

Sounds fantastic!  I'll be arriving in SF on 7/16 and leaving 7/21.  I may have to do some work 7/19 - 7/21 (Officially I'm in town to attend a conference).  I think it would be great to connect if we can make it happen.  So Kate, are a couple of eager letterboxers enough motivation to get you started.  If you need any help, post it to the list.  Something will come up.  Conversely, if you (Kate) are interested in a little road trip to Bol Park (and whatever other boxes Linda might get out by then), let me know.  Linda, Kate, Hope I connect with at least ione of you if not both.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I'll in LA 7/13 - 7/16 and will check on the Circle X box among other things.  If there are any SoCal "voyeurs" out there, speak up; maybe we can connect.<br/>
