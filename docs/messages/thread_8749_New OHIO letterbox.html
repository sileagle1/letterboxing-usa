website? Thanks!  TITLE: YOCTANGEE BADEN. This letterbox is located <br/>
in Chillicothe, Ohio  (Ross County). The city has a beautiful 60 acre <br/>
park in the downtown area. It was given the name Yoctangee Park in <br/>
1903. That same year, it was discovered that water from a well near <br/>
the park lake possessed special medicinal qualities similar to the <br/>
water of the Baden-Baden Springs in Germany.In order to make the <br/>
waters more accessible, improvements to the site were made, including <br/>
a Chinese pagoda built over the well. The well was called the <br/>
Yoctangee Baden, and its waters were said to be an effective remedy <br/>
for a number of ailments, until the well was damaged by a flood in <br/>
1907. While the Yoctangee Baden is not in use today, there is still a <br/>
pretty gazebo at the site. This will be your starting point.  CLUES: <br/>
Go to the gabezo near the lake in Yoctangee Park. Standing at the <br/>
west side of the center post,take a reading of 255 degrees. You <br/>
should see an old-fashioned lamp post on the other side of the <br/>
lake.Go to that lamp post. Then cross the small bridge with the black <br/>
railings and proceed to the next (similar) lamp post.Take a reading <br/>
of 75 degrees.Go 9 paces to the corner of the stone wall. Follow the <br/>
contour of the wall (the lake side) for 5 paces. The letterbox is <br/>
hidden in a crack near the top of the wall,behind two smaller rocks.  <br/>
NOTE: This is a microbox; please bring your own stamp pad. Also, this <br/>
spot is quite visible to passersby so please use discretion in <br/>
stamping in and rehiding. Thanks!<br/>
