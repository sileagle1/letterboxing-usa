If you'd rather not use a hot glue gun (even a low heat one) around the younger girls, you can buy special foam glue.<br/>

I have used fun foam for stamps for children... glued them onto the lids of <br/>
film containers and used the film container itself as a handle for the stamp.<br/>
OR you can easily "cut" into styrofoam meat trays with a pen as you draw on <br/>
it.<br/>
Then you can glue the "carved" styrofoam onto a piece of wood... if you don't <br/>
have meat trays (which some meat depts. will give you for free), you can buy <br/>
styrofoam plates and use them.<br/>

Then, letting use my smallest carving tool (I can't remember what size name it is, but it's a tiny "v"), I just watch over them.  Mistakes are okay - cute and add character!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I helped my 5-yo granddaughter make a stamp using a soft gum-type <br/>
eraser.  She used a butter knife and the eraser end of a pencil with <br/>
the eraser removed (to make little circles and to "chip" away the <br/>
edges).  This wouldn't work for very detailed designs because it <br/>
would be too crumbly, but it worked for her and it would be <br/>
inexpensive for practicing.  Also, when she forgets to bring her <br/>
stamp on her visits, she uses her two thumbs to make a "butterfly" <br/>
in the logbooks.<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
