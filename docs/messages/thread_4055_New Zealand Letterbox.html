Christchurch, on the south island of New Zealand.  Below are the <br/>
details!<br/>

<br/>
Native YEP Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
PLACED: October 14, 2001 by Beth &amp; Mark Bendickson  <br/>
<br/>
LOCATION:  Chirstchurch, New Zealand<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is located at a place called Riccarton Bush.<br/>
<br/>
In New Zealand, any land heavily vegetated with native trees and <br/>
shrubs, including tall forest, is often referred to as "bush".  <br/>
Riccarton Bush today is a tiney 6.4-hectare remnant, a relic of a <br/>
large forest system that once covered much of the Canterbury Plains.  <br/>
<br/>
Due to the sensitivity of this area, please take extra precautions <br/>
not to damage anything when retrieving this box and keep a keen eye <br/>
out for rangers who often patrol the area.  Also, please lend a hand <br/>
to replace or repair the contents of the box if they are damaged,<br/>
as we cannot check the box regularily.<br/>
<br/>
DIRECTIONS:  On a city map locate Kotare Street.  It is a wee bit to <br/>
the NW of the city center.  From Kotare, go south on Puriri Street, <br/>
then a left on Totara Street.  The street you are looking for next is <br/>
the one AFTER Kahu Street.  On our map it was named Ngahere Street, <br/>
but there was no street sign.  To find it just remember to take your <br/>
first left after Kahu Street.  Go to the end of the street and park <br/>
in the cul de sac.  Take the path into the park.  <br/>
<br/>
CLUES:  Follow the path just past the Dean family cottage, and turn <br/>
right at the junction.  A bit beyond here take another angled right <br/>
and head towards the park sign.  Proceed through the gate into <br/>
Riccarton Bush.<br/>
<br/>
Always stay on the "Boardwalk Circular Track" whenever you come to a <br/>
junction.  Go past the "snake root tree" on the right.  Beyond the <br/>
double bench, go left on the chicken wire boardwalk and pass another <br/>
bench.  When the boardwalk takes a 90 degree turn to your left, STOP.<br/>
Look just to the right of the large tree in front of you spotting a <br/>
large fallen log rotting on the forest floor.  Walk to the keyhole at <br/>
the far end of this log.  Step over to your left, take an about face <br/>
and walk three steps forward.  Look down low.<br/>
<br/>
Please contact us by email at nomad@hotmail.com, to let us know you <br/>
found this box and the condition it is in, plus any other comments <br/>
you may have.  We'd love to hear from you.  <br/>
<br/>
Have FUN !!<br/>
