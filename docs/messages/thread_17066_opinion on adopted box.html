meaning to the local. <br/>
<br/>
I have a similar feeling about placing boxes and creating stamps that are very <br/>
specifically designed with the location in mind. Most of my stamps (most) will <br/>
show the location with the lettering on the stamp and will also reflect something <br/>
stated in the clue or a natural landmark used in the clue. <br/>
<br/>
However, there are no "rules" saying that this has to be so.  One person's <br/>
interpretation of a hiding spot and what the box and stamp should reflect is so <br/>
open to another's. <br/>
<br/>
WRT that, I would NOT replace that stamp unless I had discussed this with the <br/>
person that originally planted the box. I might consider planting another nearby <br/>
with the clues for that only in the adopted box...? I think instead of fiddling with <br/>
someone elses box, I would use it as an example and build on that.<br/>
<br/>
However, in the case that this stamp was destroyed by say oh - fire, flood or <br/>
wild animal - then you might have just reasoning behind replacing the stamp <br/>
with another that reflects the location.  <br/>
<br/>
In general, I have adopted a few recently. One in the local area that I would like <br/>
to say has been re-adopted by the placer! I'm very happy to hear this and the <br/>
placer was also happy to be back on the list. The others are fairly far away, but <br/>
I intend to leave them completely intact and would never consider changing the <br/>
stamp or location unless I heard directly from that placer.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>

I wouldn't think anyone would mind replacing a plastic bag, pencil or <br/>
similar stuff.  I would not consider REPLACING a book, but placing a <br/>
second volume would be fine if the first was full or damaged.  I <br/>
consider the stamp the heart of the box.  If you change the stamp, it <br/>
almost becomes a new box.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to see an archive available for boxes that have been <br/>
abandoned or totally lost.  This would be great for the those seeking <br/>
a little more adventure.  It would also be great to help document the <br/>
history of this hobby for the future.<br/>

I meant to say in my original response, and someone else subsequently <br/>

help preserve the original without doing any violence to it.  I'll <br/>
bet we've all done that, and I'd welcome that degree of help with <br/>
mine.  But even leaving a pencil or a pen, because there is none <br/>
there, is open to question.  Maybe the placer intended that <br/>
particular omission.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all:<br/>
I would like to comment on this as I have adopted several <br/>
abandonded / unclaimed boxes myself.  Maybe my procedure could be of <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
First I went and found the box, to ensure it still exists.  If it <br/>
was not to be found, I posted a message with the results of my <br/>
search for others to review before searching themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Then I checked the clues, log book, and the historical messages on <br/>
the talk list to see if I could find the original placer.  I emailed <br/>
them and told them about the new web site and the necessity of <br/>
claiming their boxes.  Some were not aware, and they claimed their <br/>
boxes.  Some were happy that someone else was willing to adopt their <br/>
boxes.  Most could not be found or did not respond.<br/>
<br/>
If there were other boxes planted near to the unclaimed box, I asked <br/>
the planters of the nearby boxes if they would be interested in <br/>
adopting it.  Some did.  This will save trips to check on boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Then I asked the webmasters to assign the clues to me.  Which they <br/>
were grateful to do.<br/>
<br/>
Then I started to maintain the box as if it was my own.<br/>
<br/>
One box was in a poor location, and I moved it a few hundred feet to <br/>
a better location.  All the log books were full, so I replaced <br/>
them.  I am keeping the old log books for the box's history.  Some <br/>
of the stamps were broken.  A friend carved new stamps for me, using <br/>
the original image if possible.<br/>
<br/>
I rewrote the clues to the degree necessary to give clear <br/>
directions.  I tried to keep most of the clues intact and add or <br/>
clarify where needed.  I kept the original descriptions of the <br/>
things to see at the location.<br/>

that seems above reproach.  Certainly there are some among the 300+ <br/>
unclaimed boxes that deserve being continued, whether for historical <br/>
reasons or because of their prime location.  I myself have one in <br/>
mind here in the Central/Western NY region that qualifies on the <br/>
first point.<br/>

&gt; Hi all:<br/>
&gt; I would like to comment on this as I have adopted several <br/>
&gt; abandonded / unclaimed boxes myself.  Maybe my procedure could be <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First I went and found the box, to ensure it still exists.  If it <br/>
&gt; was not to be found, I posted a message with the results of my <br/>
&gt; search for others to review before searching themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I checked the clues, log book, and the historical messages on <br/>
&gt; the talk list to see if I could find the original placer.  I <br/>
emailed <br/>
&gt; them and told them about the new web site and the necessity of <br/>
&gt; claiming their boxes.  Some were not aware, and they claimed their <br/>
&gt; boxes.  Some were happy that someone else was willing to adopt <br/>
their <br/>
&gt; boxes.  Most could not be found or did not respond.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If there were other boxes planted near to the unclaimed box, I <br/>
asked <br/>
&gt; the planters of the nearby boxes if they would be interested in <br/>
&gt; adopting it.  Some did.  This will save trips to check on boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I asked the webmasters to assign the clues to me.  Which they <br/>
&gt; were grateful to do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then I started to maintain the box as if it was my own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One box was in a poor location, and I moved it a few hundred feet <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; a better location.  All the log books were full, so I replaced <br/>
&gt; them.  I am keeping the old log books for the box's history.  Some <br/>
&gt; of the stamps were broken.  A friend carved new stamps for me, <br/>
using <br/>
&gt; the original image if possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I rewrote the clues to the degree necessary to give clear <br/>
&gt; directions.  I tried to keep most of the clues intact and add or <br/>
&gt; clarify where needed.  I kept the original descriptions of the <br/>
&gt; things to see at the location.<br/>
