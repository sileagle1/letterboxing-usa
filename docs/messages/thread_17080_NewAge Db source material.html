                    <div class="plaintext-content">When the NewAge talk list was formed, I actually thought it was a<br/>
great idea. The folks who like the concept of a database would have<br/>
their own venue and those of us who don't would be uninvolved. I<br/>
naively assumed that the information used on their list would come<br/>
from their members and would be a way for them to report on their<br/>
boxes and my boxes would be free from database entries. I assumed<br/>
adding a "no database" type of message to each of my clues would cover<br/>
the situtation.<br/>
<br/>
However, it now seems that the LbNA talk list is the source for some<br/>
of their entries. I emailed the people I knew who were listed as last<br/>
finders on my boxes. Only one of them was an official member on the<br/>
NewAge list and thus only his two entries have been successfully<br/>
removed. NewAge members are unable to remove their own entries.<br/>
Another person who requested that their two entries be removed was<br/>
refused. This person has never been a member of that list, never made<br/>
an entry to that list and never made the comments in the "comments"<br/>
field that were attributed to him on my Hog Lake Plateau box. This<br/>
person only reported on this box on the LbNA talk list and in private<br/>
email to me. <br/>
<br/>
In the past, I used to love to hear about peoples' adventures when<br/>
hunting for letterboxes. It is one of my great pleasures in this<br/>
hobby. Now, I will feel a sense of dread every time a box report on<br/>
one of my babies appears here, not knowing if it will end up as an<br/>
unwanted database entry, especially one with a false comment. Funhog<br/>

How do you know who the last finder listed is when you're not even a <br/>
member of NewAge? Do you have to hide behind an alias to watch your <br/>
boxes?<br/>
Also, any member of NewAge can tell you that we no longer have the <br/>
last finder field in our database. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<newage are="" entries.="" members="" own="" remove="" their="" to="" unable="">&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo doesn't offer that option. It's either only moderators who can <br/>
remove entries, or anyone can remove entries. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; Another person who requested that their two entries be removed was<br/>
refused. This person has never been a member of that list, never made <br/>
an entry to that list and never made the comments in the "comments" <br/>

<br/>
If they were never a member, they couldn't have made an entry into <br/>
our database. Therefore, they have no entries to be removed. <br/>
<br/>
Also, "Bonnie" can not be listed as a finder in our database since, <br/>
like I said earlier, we don't have finders listed. <br/>
<br/>
We don't go around looking for sitreps to add info to our database. <br/>
Any box in the database is one that a member has planted themselves, <br/>
or one that they've found.<br/>

Fearing that I may be extinguishing the life of yet another of my<br/>
feline friends, I feel compelled to say that I am aware that this<br/>
information was deleted after the recent database debate started.<br/>
However, I was given the information regarding dates, finders names<br/>
and comments long before the recent threads, at a time when all of<br/>
these fields were in place. Poisoning is not a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Please! If you would just get rid of my boxes from your page, none of<br/>
this frustrating exchange would be necessary. Funhog<br/>
