                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like both the Flex &amp; Seal and the Lock 'n' Lock boxes for how well they<br/>
keep out the "elements."  But it's kind of a<br/>
what's-the-lesser-of-the-two-evils.<br/>
<br/>
People sometimes don't get the Flex &amp; Seal containers completely flexed and<br/>
sealed.  They have to make sure it's comPLETELY snapped shut, and sometimes<br/>
that little fact gets missed.<br/>
<br/>
But with the Lock 'n' Lock boxes, I've found two problems.  Folks that<br/>
aren't used to them can't remember how the tops go on by the time it comes<br/>
to packing it all up and putting it all back together.  So sometimes they<br/>
put the top on upside down.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes it's a tight fit to get the stamp and logbook back into the<br/>
container, so they force it, and end up breaking one or more of those<br/>
thingees on the sides that have to be snapped down when they go to snap the<br/>
top back on.<br/>
<br/>
The best I've found overall so far are plastic peanut butter containers that<br/>
have been well washed out so that animals don't pick up on any peanut butter<br/>
odor.  But.........I've only found them so far, never used them for placing,<br/>
because I'm afraid that someone with a peanut allergy might come along and<br/>
have a problem, even tho it's been well washed out.  So I think if I start<br/>
to use them, I'll put a note in the clues as to what type of container it<br/>
is....just in case.  Maybe plastic mayo containers.  That couldn't cause any<br/>
life threatening problems when a finder might be far far away from 9-1-1<br/>
help or there's no cell phone reception.<br/>
<br/>
They're almost foolproof.  They screw back on nice and tight and never seem<br/>
to get water in them.  And they're plastic so that the top won't rust.  I<br/>
don't know how well that plastic stands up to the elements, how soon it<br/>
might start to break down, but even if it had to be replaced every few<br/>
years, the box would probably turn up missing anyway before the plastic<br/>
broke down.  And, if not, by that time I would've emptied another mayo jar<br/>
to bring along to replace it if needed.<br/>
<br/>
But they don't come in the nice variety of sizes that Lock 'n' Locks and<br/>
Rubbermaids come in tho.<br/>

experience with some of the other containers on the list at the start <br/>
of this thread.? Bad or Good?<br/>
<br/>
One thing that seems to be coming out through this thread is some of <br/>
the problems with the containers is not the container, but the <br/>
letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
I had some of my Lb's in the older rubbermaids and they are pretty good <br/>
still. I had one occasion when I checked my Lb after a bad storm and <br/>
someone had left the top off, and they had found another on a mountain <br/>
lb nearby that I had to hike and check in a hurry and that top too was <br/>
off so maybe some a newbe basic training should be given on how to <br/>
handle boxing containers :-)<br/>
<br/>
I am sure many have some stories like that, I just would like to know <br/>
about the actual containers at this point.<br/>
