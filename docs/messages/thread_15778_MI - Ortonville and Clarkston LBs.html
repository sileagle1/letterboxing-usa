seven with a hitchhiker!  First it was to Ortonville State Park to look<br/>
for Hearts Abound and Howlin' at the Moon.  Found HA #1 with no problem,<br/>
but were disappointed not to find HA #2, that is until we walked the<br/>
trail a bit and then came back to the area and found out that we had<br/>
been looking under the wrong tree.  The Lonely Lumberjack HH decided to<br/>
join us at this point.  Then it was on to Howlin' at the Moon which we<br/>
found with relative ease, great hiding spot!<br/>
<br/>
Kudos to Puppylover for these fun clues in beautiful settings!<br/>
<br/>
Then it was back to Independence Oaks.  On our last visit we found 0 of<br/>
5 that were supposed to be there.  Dragonflies Are Free and 49 Habitat<br/>
seem to be MIA because we are pretty gosh darn certain that we found the<br/>
exact spots for these.  Once again, Ladies of the Lake stymied us and we<br/>
weren't even sure if we were in the right general area.  But we had<br/>
success with the Independent Oak and This Place Rocks.  Our problem<br/>
before was either not walking far enough or walking too far!<br/>
<br/>
Although we sort of found Independent Oak by luck.  By simply walking<br/>
around frustrated that we couldn't figure out any of the clues for it<br/>
and happening by something that looked like the last clue.<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was a good day!  Keep on the lookout for an upcoming box<br/>
or two to be placed in our quaint little town of Holly!<br/>
