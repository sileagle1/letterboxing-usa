<div>I went this route of posting clues for 2 days 
the site won't respond. It says site found waiting for reply. I've never had 
trouble getting into the site before.  Just a heads up maybe someone can 
figure out what is wrong.  Also I wanted to reply to the note on hunter 
safety. Please don't wear white in the woods it could appear as the flagging 
tail of a deer. Blaze orange is safe they even make a vest for doggie 
friends.  Don't worry you will see wildlife they are colorblind. We also 
where a jingle bell on our back packs this time of year. No hunter would mistake 
theat distinctive ringing for a deer , except maybe Rudolph. You can't be to 
careful. See you all out there.  Carol, wishing I didn't have to work 
today</div></body></html>
