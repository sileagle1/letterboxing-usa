<br/>
It was an unbelievably beautiful day in Portland! It was clear, sunny<br/>
and cool.  Not a drop of rain and it honestly felt like a spring day out<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
John and I headed for the Columbia River Gorge for a good 5 mile or so<br/>
hike along with some letterboxing!  YEE HAW!<br/>
<br/>
We headed up the trail at Wahkeena Falls, where we stamped in at the Der<br/>
Mad Stamper/Ryan Carpenter replacement of the Wahkeena Falls letterbox.<br/>
I'm so glad this letterbox has been put back with new clues and placed<br/>
in a spot less likely to be affected by slides.  Ryan is a "deer" for<br/>
honoring Der Mad Stamper and carving a great replica stamp of this fine<br/>
letterbox.  What a wonderful find!<br/>
<br/>
Up, up, up we continued onward to Fairy Falls.  After a bit more<br/>
searching than we anticipated, the magical one presented herself to us.<br/>
Another delightful Funhog stamp!  I just LOVE her beautiful homemade<br/>
logbooks, as well.  It was an excellent day for letterboxing.  We<br/>
suspect that another couple was lurking, so they may have been<br/>
letterboxers, too, waiting for us to finish our discreet (hopefully)<br/>
stamp-in. They went on up the trail and we didn't see them again, but<br/>
they may have doubled back from the Angel's Rest trail junction.<br/>
<br/>
We headed toward the top of Multnomah Falls.  On our way there we<br/>
discovered a much-needed area for a pee stop and stumbled across the<br/>
Eddie the 2nd Geocache.  This was the first Geocache we've ever seen.<br/>
My, aren't they BIG compared to a letterbox.  We didn't have anything to<br/>
exchange, but we did stamp in and write a message.<br/>
<br/>
We headed over to the top of Multnomah Falls.  All waterfalls are lush<br/>
and beautiful and the banks of the creeks were lined with the rich,<br/>
velvet carpet of moss.  Incredibly beautiful!  Once we checked out the<br/>
view from the top,  down we went and headed into the sunset.   <br/>
<br/>
On the way home also, looking to the East, the sky was filled with<br/>
wonderous pinks and blues silouetting a very snowy and majestic Mt.<br/>
Hood. WHAT A DAY!<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
