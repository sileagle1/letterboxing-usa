                    <html><body>Hi everyone!<br/>
So, I had an idea.  Actually, The Frog Family kind of gave me an idea....<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking we should have a winter gathering for the MD/VA/DC folks.  Of course, we would love to see anyone who wants to attend from whereever you want to come from!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps we could all meet for lunch somewhere and then, if weather permits, we could do some cold weather boxing.<br/>
<br/>
My current ideas are two restaurants in Columbia, MD.  I choose Columbia because that's where I live!  I figure if I'm planning it, I can make you all come to me!!!  :-)<br/>
But both of the restaurants I'm thinking of have private rooms that we could reserve for a few hours.  Also, I think Columbia is a fairly central area.  But that's just me.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking that we could meet either in early December or after the holiday insanity in January.  If it is too cold and yucky to box, then we can just hang out and enjoy each others company.<br/>
<br/>
So, what do you think?  Any takers?  This is open for discussion!!!<br/>

Good idea! Whatever month we have it in, please have it on a Saturday.<br/>
I'd be making it a whole weekend sort of thing because of the driving<br/>
time involved from Richmond, VA, to Columbia, MD. I'm not as young<br/>
(nor as reckless) as I used to be, and I prefer not to drive hours at<br/>
night or in the wee hours of the morning if I can get out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for organizing this!<br/>

faces with names.  Would this be a kid-friendly gathering or grown-<br/>
ups only? Gotta consider drive time and stuff with a youngin. January <br/>
would be better for me and mine.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone!<br/>
&gt; So, I had an idea.  Actually, The Frog Family kind of gave me an <br/>
idea....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was thinking we should have a winter gathering for the MD/VA/DC <br/>
folks.  Of <br/>
&gt; course, we would love to see anyone who wants to attend from <br/>
whereever you <br/>
&gt; want to come from!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps we could all meet for lunch somewhere and then, if weather <br/>
permits, <br/>
&gt; we could do some cold weather boxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My current ideas are two restaurants in Columbia, MD.  I choose <br/>
Columbia <br/>
&gt; because that's where I live!  I figure if I'm planning it, I can <br/>
make you all <br/>
&gt; come to me!!!  :-)<br/>
&gt; But both of the restaurants I'm thinking of have private rooms that <br/>
we could <br/>
&gt; reserve for a few hours.  Also, I think Columbia is a fairly <br/>
central area.  <br/>
&gt; But that's just me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was thinking that we could meet either in early December or after <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; holiday insanity in January.  If it is too cold and yucky to box, <br/>
then we can <br/>
&gt; just hang out and enjoy each others company.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, what do you think?  Any takers?  This is open for discussion!!!<br/>
