<div>This weekend found the lazy letterboxer and her DH at the Cape 
for some letterboxing fun. Found the Glassworks in Sagamore, the Anchorage in 
Sandwich and the 2nd of the Briar Patch boxes in East Sandwich.  Pretty 
sure we were at the right tree for the first box but, alas, it was no where to 
be found.  Has anyone had any luck with that one lately?  Then it was 
on to Yarmouthport for Heron's Haven. On Saturday we found the Cook's Tour in 
So. Wellfleet and searched in vain for our own Mr. Marconi's Wonderful 
Wireless.  The observation platform at the station site has been rebuilt 
and we fear that Mr. Marconi is missing and unaccounted for. Has anyone stamped 
into this box recently? Then it was down to Chatham to replace our Chatham 
Rooster in a new and hopefully safer hiding spot.  Thanks to all who 
planted the wonderful boxes we visited.</div>

go out during a predicted Nor'easter. (dont listen to the weather)<br/>
We have not yet searched for the briar patch boxes, however, The <br/>

the Anchorage (what a cool find, that one was!) and Glassworks. When <br/>
you get a chance, the Toxic Tack in Fairhave is worth discovering as <br/>

<div>Ooo, that drives me so crazy because the tree where we looked 
for the box was exactly as described. At least we found the 2nd box and then 
bought some excellent pickles in the Jam Kitchen so the trip was a success.

<div>Re: Mr. Marconi, I'm holding out slim hope that the box is

We started our adventure in Dennis where we found all 6 of the great boxes planted by the Headless Hunter. Will, what a fun series that is, keep up the good work. We also found the beautiful Lady Slipper box planted by Mary Manatee. On Saturday we started off at Nickerson State Park where we found all 7 of the boxes planted there, thanks to Mary Manatee &amp; the Yachtsman, Curious Crane and Latte Man and Buddy &amp; the Pigtographer (love that name!). Then it was off to Eastham where we finally found the Three Sisters Light box, it was our third try and I would like to think we would have found it even if it weren't lying right out in the open (yikes), then on to South Wellfleet to find the new Stonecroft box, what a cute stamp, and while there we replaced that logbook in our Wizard of the Waves box. Next stop was Wellfleet where we found Uncle Tim's, Long Pond and Tandem Mates, thanks Wellfleet Rambler, Tweety &amp; Mr. Coon and Gail. Then we stopped in Chatham to check on our Chatham Rooster 2 which had been reported "potentially missing" by 2 different seekers. We were happy to find it safe and sound. Then it was off to Harwich for our final box of the day, Tot Toter. The Cape has turned into such a great spot to letterbox that I hardly even made it into the Christmas Tree Shop!<br/>
Of the 20 boxes we found it is a little dismaying to report that 4 of them were not hidden well and were visible from a distance.<br/>
Once again, thanks to letterboxing, we found ourselves at some beautiful and interesting places we probably would not have found otherwise.<br/>
