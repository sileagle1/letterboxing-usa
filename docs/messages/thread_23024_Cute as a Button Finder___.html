                    <div class="plaintext-content">Someone logged a find of this LB on LBNA on 1/14/06, but identified <br/>
themselves only as "???"  If this was you, was this an actual find or <br/>
an attempted find?  The reason I am asking is because as far as I can <br/>
tell this box went missing before its first find... due to a poor <br/>
choice of location by me, of course!!!  I confirmed tonight that it is <br/>
indeed not there, and I'm going to go ahead and change the status to <br/>
missing. :-(<br/>
<br/>
But, I'm curious to know if "???" on 1/14/06 was an attempted find or <br/>
an actual find.  If this pertains to you, could you let me know, <br/>
please?  Thanks!<br/>
