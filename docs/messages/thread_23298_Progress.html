swinging golf clubs and ringing cell phones; however,<br/>

     Just for the record, the puffer fish is fine, if<br/>

If you were such an astute PI you'd actually have the name of the <br/>
suspect correct--I believe it should be TGD_Brian but then maybe <br/>
it's the fog from the tequila-goggles you're wearing right now <br/>
that's causing your ineptitude to rear its ugly head?  Or is it the <br/>
fact that everytime you're back out on the trail following a suspect <br/>
the lure of nearby letterboxes just overwhelms you and abandon your <br/>
mission for want of increasing your F count?<br/>
<br/>
As for DMS' sanity?  That was gone long ago.  ;)  We've all <br/>
witnessed that one time or another...<br/>
<br/>
Hey, now that I think about it, if you're the one with the lock-pick <br/>
kit, perhaps you're the suspect for whom we've been searching these <br/>
past 7 days!!!  Counter-surrepticious training? I'm sure a prudent <br/>
pig with such high acumen as yourself could root out such a thing <br/>
when necessary--unless of course the waft of tequila on your snout <br/>
interferes with your 'tailing' senses.  I wonder where YOUR stash of <br/>
PZ-Kut is kept these days?  Did it recently double/triple/quadruple <br/>
in size--say about a week ago?  ;)<br/>

P.S. Donkey qote is my hero! He was so misunderstood! To think he <br/>
lost his dream right before he died--how tragic!!!  If only <br/>
everybody learned to live life with the zeal of Don Quixote!<br/>

After all, the lot of PZKut which I acquired via auction was certainly not the entire booty, rather perhaps just enough was forfeited to fund his flight.  He is after all an incredible carver and to have scored such a large amount of premium carving material would certainly warrant a sabbatical.  It is quite possible he has become so wrapped up in creating brilliant stamp masterpieces that he is not even aware the shadow of suspicion has fallen on him. <br/>

I appreciate your efforts to keep our letterboxing community a safe <br/>

investigated the possibility that this "crime" is a hoax?  I did <br/>
note in your first post that you said that Mr. Der Mad Stamper <br/>
had "claimed" that a most atrocious crime had been committed.  Did <br/>
anyone else in the neighborhood hear the squealing tires in the <br/>
middle of the night?  Did that neighbor lady see or hear anything <br/>
unusual?<br/>
<br/>
Even though I am a relative newbie here and Der Mad Stamper is <br/>
nearly worshipped as a letterboxing god I think that I should speak <br/>
up.  I am worried that we may all have been taken in by thisthis <br/>
this person of alternative moral standards.<br/>
<br/>
This Mr. Stamper seems all too ready to accept the accusations made <br/>
against so many other letterboxers.  Is he so anxious to point the <br/>
finger at others because wants to avoid anyone looking at him?  Did <br/>
he make this all up to collect on an insurance claim?  Or worse yet, <br/>
does he want to make us believe that it's all gone so no one will <br/>
ask him to share his hoard?!<br/>

 Oh please, this is so typical of you people, "I know! Lets look for <br/>
the lowest common denominator." i.e.: someone we can all agree to <br/>
dislike and then blame it all on him. I need this like I need another <br/>
flaming bag of crap dumped on my door step. Since the cops took both <br/>
my rocksalt and my shotguns away, you kids have been running amok in <br/>
the neighborhood, with total disregard for your elders. <br/>
<br/>
 Truth is, we were in Japan on the date in question, and yes, due to <br/>
time differences, we also happened to be on the west coast during the <br/>
early morning hours of the day after, although we never left the <br/>
airport. We had been in Japan visiting the Sony Corps's headquarters <br/>
to ink the deal on the new game I developed called "The Letterboxer". <br/>
This picture showing me with two Sony bigwigs proves with out a doubt <br/>
that this is true. PorkBelly please make note of the date stamp in <br/>
the corner.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/teamgreendragon2003/Brian_Sony.jpg<br/>
<br/>
 Speaking of the game. It's going to be really great! Just like the <br/>
real thing, only you don't ever need to leave the couch, so I know it <br/>
will be a big hit with most of you. You can play as yourself or <br/>
assume the identity of notable boxers like WanderingPete, <br/>
LedgendofMaine, FunkyHog or AloofAir. Or, of course, you can make up <br/>
any goofy name you like or just stick with one you already have. It <br/>
will have a section to design your own sig stamp with a carving <br/>
tutorial to help those of you that have always wanted to carve well <br/>
but couldn't muster the intellect. It will also be on-line compatible <br/>
so you can hide boxes for others to find as well as look for those <br/>
placed by others. You get to write your own clues so you can make <br/>
them frustratingly misleading and hard with something of little or no <br/>
value at the end of it all, or easy and straight forward, with again, <br/>
something of little or no value at the end. I also had them develop a <br/>
message board feature modeled after the ones at AQ, so you all could <br/>
go on and on with pointless and meaningless drivel,  just like in <br/>
real life. The playing area is huge and encompasses many different <br/>
types of terrain, all of it in three thousand polygon mesh with three <br/>
dimensional positional audio. Everything from urban settings, forests <br/>
or desert, all of these will support realistic vector based physics <br/>
so if you find yourself stuck out on the edge of a cliff, the danger <br/>
will be real. It really does have something for everyone. As you <br/>
advance and gather more finds you can even get gear upgrades to deal <br/>
with the obstacles and dangers you will encounter along the way. How <br/>
cool will it be to start off having to deal with pesky critters and <br/>
such with Silent Dude's walking poles and then be able to upgrade to <br/>
Worrier Woman's switchblade?  At one point, you may even get the <br/>
chance to get your inky hands on Scout Hound's Glock. What fun it <br/>
will be to deal with troublesome coyotes with Molly's thirty eight! <br/>
The virtual gatherings are something people are really going to <br/>
enjoy. We fine tuned the AI so that the virtual boxers will be even <br/>
smarter and more interesting than most of the real boxers you are apt <br/>
to meet. At one point in the game you will even be able to gain <br/>
access to various vehicles so those of you who enjoy "drive bys" <br/>
won't be disappointed at all. The best thing about the game is that <br/>
it will make me stinking rich. It will be on the shelves for this <br/>
coming Christmas, so I need all of you to put it on your list to <br/>
Santa and then be especially nice so that it shows up under your <br/>
tree. <br/>
<br/>
 So anyhow, while in the airport I noticed the worst half of the <br/>
Peperazzi being hassled by security at gate 25. I shouted to him and <br/>
either he couldn't hear me, which I doubt, or he was ignoring me, <br/>
which I get a lot of. It was fairly obvious that they were hassling <br/>
him about some of the stuff in his carry on baggage. They had pulled <br/>
from one of these bags a bunch of tools, like a dent puller, crow <br/>
bar, and what to me, looked like a lock picking kit. He was going on <br/>
and on, as he is prone to do, about being a hardware salesman or some <br/>
such nonsense, which I know for a fact not to be true. The other bag <br/>
was just bulging full of something white, in plain brown paper <br/>
wrapping. They had also dragged over his check in baggage and it <br/>
looked to be full of the same stuff. My eyes ain't what they use to <br/>

&gt; &gt;      For now your assistance is needed. The hunt is on<br/>
&gt; &gt; for this TDG_Brian character. Is any one aware of his<br/>
&gt; &gt; whereabouts? It is imperative that this person be<br/>
&gt; &gt; questioned. I need your help, as I will be out buying<br/>
&gt; &gt; tulip bulbs in the morning. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Oh please, this is so typical of you people, "I know! Lets look <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; the lowest common denominator." i.e.: someone we can all agree to <br/>
&gt; dislike and then blame it all on him. I need this like I need <br/>
another <br/>
&gt; flaming bag of crap dumped on my door step. Since the cops took <br/>
both <br/>
&gt; my rocksalt and my shotguns away, you kids have been running amok <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the neighborhood, with total disregard for your elders. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Truth is, we were in Japan on the date in question, and yes, due <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; time differences, we also happened to be on the west coast during <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; early morning hours of the day after, although we never left the <br/>
&gt; airport. We had been in Japan visiting the Sony Corps's <br/>
headquarters <br/>
&gt; to ink the deal on the new game I developed called "The <br/>
Letterboxer". <br/>
&gt; This picture showing me with two Sony bigwigs proves with out a <br/>
doubt <br/>
&gt; that this is true. PorkBelly please make note of the date stamp in <br/>
&gt; the corner.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; http://www.geocities.com/teamgreendragon2003/Brian_Sony.jpg<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Speaking of the game. It's going to be really great! Just like <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; real thing, only you don't ever need to leave the couch, so I know <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; will be a big hit with most of you. You can play as yourself or <br/>
&gt; assume the identity of notable boxers like WanderingPete, <br/>
&gt; LedgendofMaine, FunkyHog or AloofAir. Or, of course, you can make <br/>
up <br/>
&gt; any goofy name you like or just stick with one you already have. <br/>
It <br/>
&gt; will have a section to design your own sig stamp with a carving <br/>
&gt; tutorial to help those of you that have always wanted to carve <br/>
well <br/>
&gt; but couldn't muster the intellect. It will also be on-line <br/>
compatible <br/>
&gt; so you can hide boxes for others to find as well as look for those <br/>
&gt; placed by others. You get to write your own clues so you can make <br/>
&gt; them frustratingly misleading and hard with something of little or <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; value at the end of it all, or easy and straight forward, with <br/>
again, <br/>
&gt; something of little or no value at the end. I also had them <br/>
develop a <br/>
&gt; message board feature modeled after the ones at AQ, so you all <br/>
could <br/>
&gt; go on and on with pointless and meaningless drivel,  just like in <br/>
&gt; real life. The playing area is huge and encompasses many different <br/>
&gt; types of terrain, all of it in three thousand polygon mesh with <br/>
three <br/>
&gt; dimensional positional audio. Everything from urban settings, <br/>
forests <br/>
&gt; or desert, all of these will support realistic vector based <br/>
physics <br/>
&gt; so if you find yourself stuck out on the edge of a cliff, the <br/>
danger <br/>
&gt; will be real. It really does have something for everyone. As you <br/>
&gt; advance and gather more finds you can even get gear upgrades to <br/>
deal <br/>
&gt; with the obstacles and dangers you will encounter along the way. <br/>
How <br/>
&gt; cool will it be to start off having to deal with pesky critters <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; such with Silent Dude's walking poles and then be able to upgrade <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; Worrier Woman's switchblade?  At one point, you may even get the <br/>
&gt; chance to get your inky hands on Scout Hound's Glock. What fun it <br/>
&gt; will be to deal with troublesome coyotes with Molly's thirty <br/>
eight! <br/>
&gt; The virtual gatherings are something people are really going to <br/>
&gt; enjoy. We fine tuned the AI so that the virtual boxers will be <br/>
even <br/>
&gt; smarter and more interesting than most of the real boxers you are <br/>
apt <br/>
&gt; to meet. At one point in the game you will even be able to gain <br/>
&gt; access to various vehicles so those of you who enjoy "drive bys" <br/>
&gt; won't be disappointed at all. The best thing about the game is <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; it will make me stinking rich. It will be on the shelves for this <br/>
&gt; coming Christmas, so I need all of you to put it on your list to <br/>
&gt; Santa and then be especially nice so that it shows up under your <br/>
&gt; tree. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  So anyhow, while in the airport I noticed the worst half of the <br/>
&gt; Peperazzi being hassled by security at gate 25. I shouted to him <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; either he couldn't hear me, which I doubt, or he was ignoring me, <br/>
&gt; which I get a lot of. It was fairly obvious that they were <br/>
hassling <br/>
&gt; him about some of the stuff in his carry on baggage. They had <br/>
pulled <br/>
&gt; from one of these bags a bunch of tools, like a dent puller, crow <br/>
&gt; bar, and what to me, looked like a lock picking kit. He was going <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; and on, as he is prone to do, about being a hardware salesman or <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; such nonsense, which I know for a fact not to be true. The other <br/>
bag <br/>
&gt; was just bulging full of something white, in plain brown paper <br/>
&gt; wrapping. They had also dragged over his check in baggage and it <br/>
&gt; looked to be full of the same stuff. My eyes ain't what they use <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; be so I can't say for sure what it was. He was trying to explain <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; it wasn't drugs but I don't think they were buying it at all. How <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; ended I have no clue, we had to catch our connecting flight and <br/>

Dear Investigator Bacon,<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your efforts to keep our letterboxing community a safe <br/>
and friendly place.  I am wondering, though, if you have <br/>
investigated the possibility that this "crime" is a hoax?  I did <br/>
note in your first post that you said that Mr. Der Mad Stamper <br/>
had "claimed" that a most atrocious crime had been committed.  Did <br/>
anyone else in the neighborhood hear the squealing tires in the <br/>
middle of the night?  Did that neighbor lady see or hear anything <br/>
unusual?<br/>
<br/>
Even though I am a relative newbie here and Der Mad Stamper is <br/>
nearly worshipped as a letterboxing god I think that I should speak <br/>
up.  I am worried that we may all have been taken in by this.this .<br/>
this person of alternative moral standards.<br/>
<br/>
This Mr. Stamper seems all too ready to accept the accusations made <br/>
against so many other letterboxers.  Is he so anxious to point the <br/>
finger at others because wants to avoid anyone looking at him?  Did <br/>
he make this all up to collect on an insurance claim?  Or worse yet, <br/>
does he want to make us believe that it's all gone so no one will <br/>
ask him to share his hoard?!<br/>
<br/>
Respectfully submitted for your consideration,<br/>
Aunt Teri<br/>

like just the type to do something like this!<br/>

What-the-heck-is-Ebay... indeed! Like someone with the technical <br/>
knowledge to create video games might never have heard of eBay!<br/>
<br/>
Sure, he never left the airport... I know for a fact that you can get <br/>
from the Portland airport to Ting Lee's massage parlor (which is within <br/>
walking distance of my house) in thirty minutes flat.<br/>
<br/>
So, it seems entirely plausible that arrangements could be made during <br/>
a short layover to rent a car, steal my beloved PZ Kut, and still have <br/>
plenty of time to get through security and be on an out-going flight.<br/>

Where's an officer when you need one? Somebody arrest this man!!!<br/>

Hey, we're practically a hop, skip &amp; a swim away from Japan at the <br/>
moment and we never saw this feller over here.  I think it's bunk.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
The game sounds awesome, though!  Great for when those Yellow Dust <br/>
storms hit and leave us hunkered down indoors for weeks on end.  Can't <br/>
wait for Christmas.  Thanks for creating such a deviation to help us <br/>
pass our time.  Hey, is it able to track PFX and the rest of the entire <br/>
Greek alphabet counts?  That'd be something we're really in search of.<br/>

I will not answer any other questions put forth by those who don't <br/>

Believe me I worked them hard to include this feature. Problem is <br/>
that I could not convince them that a PLB was in any way a real <br/>
letterbox. Corporate policy I guess.<br/>

Hmmm... after reading this comment, I'm wondering if I've been too <br/>
quick to judge this Green Brian Dragon Team fellow. He seems to speak <br/>
my language...<br/>
<br/>
But, before I let you off the hook, there are still a few unanswered <br/>
questions to be dealt with, mister!<br/>
<br/>
1. You're talking about beer, right?<br/>
<br/>
2. Are you buying?<br/>
