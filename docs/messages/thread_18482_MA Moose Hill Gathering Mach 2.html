Sunday, June 27 from 1 p.m. - 5 p.m. for the second annual Moose Hill Gathering! <br/>
<br/>
We are hoping to see some familiar faces and perhaps welcome some new folks <br/>
(as the nature center has put this in their program bulletin). This time we <br/>
hope for a lovely day and to be able to use the picnic tables outdoors. Last year <br/>
we fit 80 of us into the nature center on that bitterly cold January day <br/>
(shiver!).<br/>
<br/>
The potluck nature of these events always leaves us with tons of food, so <br/>
CSCM and I  will provide cold drinks and leave the rest to fate. I will carve an <br/>
event stamp, but others are welcome to carve too. There are several boxes on <br/>
the sanctuary, but I'm sure there will be some event-only boxes as well. Let us <br/>
know if you are able to come by RSVP'ing.<br/>
<br/>
See you there!!<br/>

Hi Kim,<br/>
I just joined this group.  I stumbled across letterboxing doing some <br/>
research on homeschooling and am throughly intrigued!  I explained it <br/>
to my 11 yo daughter and she's very excited!   I'll mark my calendar <br/>
for June 27, not sure yet if we can make it but we'll try!  We live <br/>
in No Reading, MA.<br/>
