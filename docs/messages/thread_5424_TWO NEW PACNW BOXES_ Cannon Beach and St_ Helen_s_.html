I check the letterboxing.org website first to make sure there are boxes <br/>
I can go get first.<br/>
<br/>
       This, my dears, is the first sign of obsession.<br/>

       LETTERBOX: CANNON BEACH<br/>
       PLACED: May 18, 2002<br/>
       LOCATION: Cannon Beach, OR, USA<br/>
<br/>
       To get to Cannon Beach, drive west from Portland on the 26 until <br/>
you get to Hwy 1. Follow the signs South for approximately 4 miles, then <br/>
follow the signs into town. Park anywhere (there is lots of parking <br/>
available), and head West to the beach.<br/>
<br/>
       On the beach, locate Haystack Rock. You'll know Haystack rock <br/>
because it's the HEEEYOOOGE rock rising out of the middle of the water <br/>
with all the tourists flocked around it like the world's first wonder. <br/>
Go there.<br/>
<br/>
       Once there, continue south, down the beach. You're going to want <br/>
to time this so that it's either receding or low tide, as certain parts <br/>
of the beach become nearly inaccessible at other times. Walk as far as <br/>
you can. (Approximately three miles, though it doesn't seem that long <br/>
because you can see for a LONG way.) You'll know the end when you get to <br/>
a giant rectangular rock on the beach. You can climb this rock and sit <br/>
there contemplating the meaning of life while the sun goes down, in <br/>
fact, provided you've got the right tides.<br/>
<br/>
       Once you've got it all figured out, climb down off the rock and <br/>
head back toward town on the beach. This time, though, watch the east <br/>
side of the beach -- where the stairs are. Most of the sets are for <br/>
private homes, but roughly a quarter mile back, you'll find a set of <br/>
very narrow piled rocks that are meant to be public access -- they have <br/>
metal railings to the left (which is actually duct tape and PVC pipe). <br/>
There is one set of railings, and then a lone pole as you continue up <br/>
(about ten steps or so). On the opposite side (your right) are a bunch <br/>
of scrub grasses and scraggly bushes. DIRECTLY across from the Lone Pole <br/>
is the letterbox, hidden in the brush. You may want to have gloves with <br/>
you -- the bushes are kind of scratchy.<br/>

       LETTERBOX: EAGLE CLIFFS<br/>
       PLACED: MAY 19, 2002<br/>
       LOCATION: EAGLE CLIFFS PARK, MT. SAINT HELENS NATIONAL PARK, <br/>
COUGAR, WA<br/>
<br/>
       Although the hike to the box isn't all that strenuous, finding <br/>
this amazing little park was a piece of serendipity for us -- one that <br/>
we hope you enjoy repeating.<br/>
<br/>
       From I-5, take the exit for Cougar (I believe it's 23, don't hold <br/>
me to that.) Head east and don't turn. The highway will take you through <br/>
Yale (where the climber's registration is, if you're interested -- get <br/>
there early, there's a lottery if conditions are good.), then Cougar, <br/>
and eventually turns into state parks road 25. You'll see a turn off for <br/>
Ape Caves -- go past it, toward Windy Ridge. Continue on 25 through the <br/>
forest and just after the work station on your left is a junction of 25 <br/>
and state parks road 90. Turn right. A short way down this road, on your <br/>
left, will be a sign for Eagle Cliffs, just before a bridge.<br/>
<br/>
       Turn in and park. Find the greenish information sign and head <br/>
down the hill toward the water. Follow the trail under the bridge and <br/>
past the picnic area to a small clearing of sorts on your right.<br/>
<br/>
       In the middle of this clearing is a rock. Go to it. From there, <br/>
face the road, and you'll see a log straight in front of you that's been <br/>
charred in places. The letterbox you seek is at the near end of that <br/>
log, hidden underneath. (easiest access is from the left side as you <br/>
face the road.) It's very near a small evergreen tree, if that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Once you've gotten the letterbox and have explored the Lewis River, if <br/>
you head across the road there's a general store on the left. The owners <br/>
were very nice on our trek (we were quite lost, due to the snow having <br/>
closed some roads), and we found out they rent -cabins- for -$33- a <br/>
night. Expect some letterboxes up that way soon.... :)<br/>
<br/>
One other little note:  After I placed this last box, my partner was <br/>
treated to the sight of the Happy Letterboxer Dance(tm), where I waved <br/>
my walking stick around over my head, hips gyrating madly, and sang, <br/>
"heh-heh-heh-HEH-heh; I am a P FOUR, he-heh=he-HEH-heh...."<br/>
<br/>
I'm so lucky he understands that I'm a nutcase.<br/>
