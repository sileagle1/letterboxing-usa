                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yup! today singin men turned us into singin frogs,as we stamped it.We where the fifth ones to get it.Loved the clues we like to see more of those,they where neet.it was slow at first but once we started catching on we where hounds on the sent of a rabbit,we kept walking faster and faster the closer we got.We where happy to find it because at first we couldn't make heads or tails of it because we don't know the area.But where starting to get to know Mansfield pretty good,and we love it,its unreal how much you have to do out there.Down our way theirs hardly any trails,but i'm looking pretty soon I hope to be keeping you all very busy.I plan on putting out three boxes tomorrw and one of them is my very first carving so don't to many of you start laughing to hard.Well Merry Xmas everyone.Lenny/Kathy <br/>
