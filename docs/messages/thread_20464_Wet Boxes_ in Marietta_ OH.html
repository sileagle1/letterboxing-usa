&gt; I found some containers at K-Mart called "Stow Always", by some company in Chicago <br/>

deep groove on the lid and then the lip of the lid, formed by the groove goes pretty far <br/>
down onto the top of the container. And the top of the container has a slanted lip on it <br/>
also, that meets the slanted bottom of the lid. This is probably about as clear as mud, but <br/>
they seem like they would work very well. <br/>

Seriously though, I'm so sorry to hear your area was flooded!!   Regrets to <br/>
all who have experienced something similar!<br/>

&gt;I recently received pictures of flooded Marietta, Oh. The park where my <br/>
&gt;Half Marathon Box<br/>
&gt;is/was placed was under about 2 ft of water! Since I did not have a heavy <br/>
&gt;rock on the box,<br/>
