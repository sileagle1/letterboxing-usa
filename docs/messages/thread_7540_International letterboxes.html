<br/>
You listed one of the Honduras boxes that are listed on the Central <br/>
America/Carabean page.  Not the other 4.  We have several <br/>
international boxes listed on that page...  And several that have <br/>
never been added.  (i.e. my Cayman Islands box).<br/>
<br/>
It may be hard to get a handle on all the boxes which have previously <br/>
been listed.  <br/>

<br/>
You and the Webmasters are dears for putting together a section for<br/>
international letterboxes that we've placed while abroad. <br/>
<br/>
 I placed a letterbox in Kaikoura on the South Island in New Zealand<br/>
back at the end of December called Little Shag Letterbox.  The clues<br/>
were posted either late December of 2001 or January 2002.  Mark and Beth<br/>
Bendickson hid one in Christchurch called Native Yep at Riccarton Bush<br/>
and the clues were probably posted to the list around the same time, if<br/>
I'm not mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for doing this.  I sure appreciate it, so that if and when I get<br/>
to go places in the future I can look to the website and see if anything<br/>
exists elsewhere in the big wide world!  <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>

Are you going to add an icon to the original map page of Der Mad <br/>
Stamper's, to indicate "international boxes" ?<br/>
