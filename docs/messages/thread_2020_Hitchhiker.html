Hi All-<br/>
<br/>
Before I left sunny and warm south Florida on Wednesday 2/28, I planted a <br/>
hitchhiker, the San Marco, within the box Mirkwood, Jackybird, Carla and I <br/>
planted last week. When found and moved please keep me posted via the list or <br/>
email as noted in the logbook. <br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing to all........from cold, snowy Connecticut<br/>

great new box, I would guess that Jay D put it there when the box was <br/>
planted at the time of the Gather.  Thanks, it was fun to find it, and <br/>
it has already continued off on its travels. My but it is a busy little <br/>
hiker, as I have seen the mention of it in many boxes , having just <br/>
missed it twice, it was all the sweeter to capture it.<br/>

<br/>
I wonder if a SASE would likely get separated from the hitchhiker, or how <br/>
long an envelope would hold up without getting too worn to use, since a <br/>
hitchhiker could be on the road for years. You'd probably want the stamp <br/>
and the log, so that would make for a somewhat bulky, sturdy envelope, and <br/>
how much postage would you put on it, given the USPS's record of increasing <br/>
mail rates on a regular basis?<br/>
<br/>
I think most letterboxers would be happy to return a full hitchhiker to you <br/>
when it's time to be retired. Why not put a note on the last page of the <br/>
log,along with your contact info, asking the last person to pick up the <br/>
hitchhiker to get in touch with you, by email, phone, or in writing), to <br/>
arrange the return trip to you? You could offer to reimburse them for their <br/>
expenses.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's good to keep hitchhikers as simple and as compact as possible, <br/>
since they have to be hidden along with other letterboxes and they get <br/>
carried around in backpacks for long stretches of time.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents...<br/>

&gt; long an envelope would hold up without getting too worn to use, <br/>
since a <br/>
&gt; hitchhiker could be on the road for years. You'd probably want the <br/>
stamp <br/>
&gt; and the log, so that would make for a somewhat bulky, sturdy <br/>
envelope, and <br/>
&gt; how much postage would you put on it, given the USPS's record of <br/>
increasing <br/>
&gt; mail rates on a regular basis?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think most letterboxers would be happy to return a full <br/>
hitchhiker to you <br/>
&gt; when it's time to be retired. Why not put a note on the last page <br/>
of the <br/>
&gt; log,along with your contact info, asking the last person to pick up <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; hitchhiker to get in touch with you, by email, phone, or in <br/>
writing), to <br/>
&gt; arrange the return trip to you? You could offer to reimburse them <br/>
for their <br/>
&gt; expenses.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it's good to keep hitchhikers as simple and as compact as <br/>
possible, <br/>
&gt; since they have to be hidden along with other letterboxes and they <br/>
get <br/>
&gt; carried around in backpacks for long stretches of time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just my two cents...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today we found the moon and stars letterbox. The Dragon Hitchhiker was in <br/>
it. It was placed by E-Man. (I can't find a way to contact him). The logbook <br/>
was very wet and damaged. We took it home and dried it, however it is far <br/>
too damaged. We were the first ones to find it. The first page, which has <br/>
E-Man's stamp and the date that it was started is salvagable. I will take <br/>
that page and paste it into a new logbook and send him flying again <br/>
tomorrow. Also we found the Salamander letterbox which was in excellent <br/>
condition. Just as we left that box we saw a huge bull moose standing in a <br/>
field of ferns. We were able to watch him for about 5 minutes and got a <br/>
couple of good pictures of him. What a wonderful trip.<br/>

Just a quick not to let everyone know that the 'Lost Hiker' hitchhiker was released somewhere in Ft. Steilacoom park yesterday.  There's easily a dozen different boxes there so I would suggest that you start early!  (grin)<br/>

Here in Conn. there is a letterboxer by the trailname "Swiper", <br/>
perhaps of the four-footed variety...check out the "Swiper" boxes on <br/>
LbNA. There are no HH's listed but there are several boxes named for <br/>
and about Swiper's activities. You might try the LbNA link to contact <br/>
placer.<br/>
Connfederate}<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know I found a hitchhiker about a month ago and contacted the maker to find it under letterboxes. It had started as a letterbox (I think) and was released into the wild as a hitchhiker at some point. Since then I always search the name and not the type. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with Swiper!<br/>

I am looking for some information on a hitchhiker we recently ran <br/>
across... I was so excited about finding my first hitchhiker (and <br/>
trying to make sure I stamped everything correctly, put everything <br/>
back in the multiple bags correctly, etc) that I did not write down <br/>
the origin of the hitchhiker or the name or contact info of the <br/>
planter. I would like to be able to contact them and give them a <br/>
status update... The name of the HH is The Bat-Brained HH and it is <br/>
not listed on either AQ or LBNA. Thanks!<br/>
