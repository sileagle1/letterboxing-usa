<div><span class="560541516-16112002">Yesterday we went to 
Christmas Around the World boxes at Pumpkin Hill, Chaplin CT. I think 
the 1 1/2 hours that is the estimated time to do the 6 boxes is actually 
even a bit less. Irish Tinker and her little elf Rosie Bunny planted some nice 
boxes with great carvings. I was impressed. with the stamps and there were 
several nice views. Molly enjoyed running around and going in the water. 
 The tree on box #1 is very unusual. I like that kind of stuff. It really 
stands out. While there we were also able to do an exchange with Pixie Pan, The 
Egg Man, and Peter Rabbit. Lil Pup was there also, being carried. Lil Pup 
dropped his stamp out there. If  anyone finds it, please post it on LBNA 
for them. Had a nice time there. Thank you Irish Tinker and Rosie Bunny for 
planting them....Chuck, Molly, Chickabirdie</span></div></body></html>
