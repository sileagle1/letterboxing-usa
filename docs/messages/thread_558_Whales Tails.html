<br/>
I just got back from placing a box a few miles down the road in <br/>
Randolph. The Whales Tails letterbox can be accessed either through <br/>
our system of maps or directly at<br/>
<br/>
http://www.sover.net/~tcooch/randolph.htm#whales<br/>
<br/>
I hope to have a photograph of the sculpture on the page soon. It has <br/>
become the symbol for the town over the past decade.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the nautical nature of the clues (which are basically easy), <br/>
the interesting feature of the box for me is that it is plugged. <br/>
There was some discussion of this method of hiding a box a few months <br/>
back on our list, but I am not sure if any NA box has actually been <br/>
plugged prior to this one.<br/>
<br/>
The hiding location was in tall unmowed grass. I trimmed the grass <br/>
down to about two inches over a circle of about one foot in diameter. <br/>
Then I cut out a circle of sod of almost the same size with a trowel, <br/>
lifted out the plug (about 3 inches in thickness), and dug a <br/>
letterbox-sized hole in the exposed dirt.<br/>
<br/>
Rocks were a minor problem. Those right under the plug were small <br/>
enough that I could pry them out. But I had to make the whole a <br/>
little shallower (and hence wider) because of a larger rock deeper <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
I had been focused on making a plug that would support a person <br/>
standing on it. This does not seem to be a problem at all. I would <br/>
make the plug smaller next time. In any case, the odds of a person's <br/>
accidentally walking on this spot are very small. When done, I <br/>
brushed some of the surrounding tall grass inward over the spot.<br/>
<br/>
I think the clues are easy enough (only one advance to make from the <br/>
starting spot) that most people will end up right on the plug. <br/>
However, I also found a means of marking the plug which will make its <br/>
location quite clear to anyone within 3 or 4 feet of it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it gets some visitors.<br/>

Thanks, Wendy. I'm only an armchair mariner - years of reading <br/>
Patrick O'Brian - and I'm still not certain I've got it right, with <br/>
the points off such and such bow. Any reallife mariners who want to <br/>
call me a grass-combing sod clearly have license to do so!<br/>

We're all off on the 17th for a week in the Adirondacks - have rented <br/>

Very clever idea for hiding a box, let us know how it holds up. Do you need<br/>
to keep re-cutting the sod so it doesn't root over the box?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">About two weeks ago, the Whales Tails sculpture was sold and moved <br/>
from Randolph to South Burlington, Vermont. I took the clues page <br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I was able to transplant the box, modifying the clues <br/>
slightly to match the new locale. You may access the page at<br/>
<br/>
http://www.sover.net/~tcooch/whales.htm<br/>
<br/>
or through our letterboxing.org map page.<br/>
<br/>
The box is still plugged. The soil is so dry now, with the east coast <br/>
drought, that I am a little afraid for the integrity of the plug. <br/>
Probably it will be fine once we get a little rain - unless a _whole <br/>
lot_ of people find the box before then :-}<br/>
<br/>
The new site at Technology Park is not so attractive as the previous <br/>
site in Randolph, though it has yet to be landscaped. The sculpture <br/>
is closer now to the interstate, however, and is being seen by a lot <br/>
more people!<br/>
