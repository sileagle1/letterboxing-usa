Having looked around, I've found some "off-list" websites and blogs <br/>
where folks post their clues, both easy and difficult, for anyone <br/>
taking the "next step" of seeking other than from AQ/LB.  Sorry to <br/>
have set y'all off; also, sorry to have misspoken re: "ridiculous <br/>
people"; should have phrased that MUCH differently.<br/>
<br/>
Still haven't found anyone in my area with a off-list blog or <br/>
website.  I think the game is just in it's infancy around here, and <br/>
am now resigned to the fact that I must drive at least 1-1/2 hours <br/>
to find new boxes.  Which means it ain't happening that much; time <br/>
and gas money do not converge that frequently!<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks to those kind folks who emailed me privately; your <br/>
promised gift will arrive no later than early spring.  Elaborate <br/>
plans are in the works - I hope you can make it here at that time!<br/>
<br/>
M'kay. Bye now!<br/>

What area is that? I'm still wet behind the ears, and looking for lb'ers  <br/>
around here (Central Florida).<br/>

Thank you Springchick for highlighting the difference between<br/>
WOM/offline/off-list. Offlist clues do not constitute off-line in any<br/>
way shape or form if they are posted on a blog. Offline means not<br/>
distributed electronically through means of internet/blog/email<br/>
posting. Off-list is merely diluted 3-fold as opposed to complete<br/>
watered down varieties.  Those that are thirsty for more juicy options<br/>
better keep them offline completely.<br/>

You could be the one with a few clues posted on a personal blog instead of LbNA or AQ -- there are many free blogging services that take very little time and technical know-how to get off the ground.  The more you do to coax the hobby, the more that will come back to you.  You don't have to resign yourself to waiting for it to happen.  Make it happen.  Think of it as an opportunity...<br/>
