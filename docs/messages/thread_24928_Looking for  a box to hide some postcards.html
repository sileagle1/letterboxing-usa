Here's my idea, I bought some postage paid postcards and addressed them <br/>
to my Aunt Millie. I'm going to put them in one of my local boxes for <br/>
people to stamp and mail off. But I would like her to get some cards <br/>
from more exotic places! If you own or know of a box with some extra <br/>

<br/>
Here's the message I wrote to include in the box:<br/>
<br/>
"Postcards for Aunt Millie<br/>
<br/>
In this box we placed some postage paid postcards for our Aunt Millie. <br/>
She will get a kick out of getting some mail. All you need to do is <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;  Maybe we could all stamp t-shirts and send them to aunt <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;  Nathan, I think she is talking about you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  While I will not disagree with her, I can not help but think a <br/>
new <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; precedent has bean set on this list again. It would seem that <br/>
calling <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; somebody an idiot, or better yet an @#%&amp; f,en idiot was totally <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; acceptable to the powers that be. Idiots that they may be.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, it's certainly is not the worst I have ever been called. I <br/>
prefer <br/>
&gt; &gt; Mr. Idiot, by the way.<br/>

&gt; Silverback; is that one of those guys that you see on the beach<br/>
&gt; wearing a bright bathing suit and flashy watch who is usually too loud<br/>

No, they are just old, worn out, grumpy gorillas.<br/>

Well Nathan is partially correct, but most of the female gorillas <br/>
would question the "worn out" description.<br/>
