I live in east central Iowa, and I've noticed all the action going <br/>
on in your corner of the state.  I hope to get down that way <br/>
sometime this summer to find the boxes y'all have placed.  Gas <br/>
prices certainly make me think twice about many extra miles.  That <br/>
really stinks.<br/>
