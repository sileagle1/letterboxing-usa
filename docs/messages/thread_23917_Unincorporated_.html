  It's not treachery in that those people aren't paying any taxes that go to<br/>
  support any library system. Our county doesn't have a county library. So<br/>
  anyone who lives in an unincorporated area doesn't pay a single dime of<br/>
  taxes, either thru their own property tax or thru a landlord paying<br/>
property<br/>
  taxes, that goes to support a library.<br/>
<br/>
  In our area, if a person has a library card for one library, they can walk<br/>
  into a ton of other libraries in the area and check out books with the<br/>
card<br/>
  they have from their own town's library. It's a reciprocal service type of<br/>
  thing. They can walk into my town's library, and I can walk into their<br/>
  town's library. But these are people who live in unincorporated areas so<br/>
  they have absolutely no library card to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
  So if I'm paying to support the library thru my property taxes or thru the<br/>
  rent I pay my landlord, why should I be happy if a family who doesn't<br/>
  support any libary at all is able to take books out of my town's library?<br/>
<br/>
  If the people could afford to live in town, they do. A lot of them rent in<br/>
  unincorporated areas because there are more slumlords in the<br/>
unincorporated<br/>
  areas with cheaper rents and with far less restrictions on occupancy<br/>
  numbers. Right now it's actually occupancy numbers more than rent that are<br/>
  THE big thing in our area. There are poverty level families that will<br/>
  squeeze an extended family of 15 or 16 people or more into a two bedroom<br/>
  apartment or townhouse. Or poorer families who own their own homes will<br/>
  turn those homes into "boarding houses" for extra weekly cash, something<br/>
  that tends to be strictly controlled by towns and villages but not so much<br/>
  by the county if the house is in an unincorporated area. Altho the county<br/>
  does at least come down on people who turn their unattached garages into<br/>
  "boarding houses" -- if they find out about it.<br/>

  $400 a year for a flippin' library card? That's insane! I've gotten<br/>
  library cards for all the different library networks in the metro<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've only lived in the west, CA and WA,  and it was common in both places.<br/>
In fact I lived in an unincorporated area 6 miles from downtown Seattle as<br/>
the crow flies--so while unincorporated can be extremely remote areas, it<br/>
can also be close to urban centers.<br/>
<br/>
If you're unincorporated you're just part of the next larger government,<br/>
rather than a city. Typically it's the county.  Usually, that government<br/>
contracts with other municipalities to provide services if it doesn't<br/>
provide them themself.  In my situation I got fire coverage from the City of<br/>
Seattle and Police coverage from the county sheriff.  And thus it goes.  Our<br/>
county had a library system so we didn't have to pay for a city library, but<br/>
then we could join the City library system too free of charge.<br/>
<br/>
Usually a city will only try to incorporate an unincorporated area when the<br/>
tax base has grown to a significant size.  Which means the politicians see a<br/>
free lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Usually areas resist incorrporation for 3 reason: The municipality trying to<br/>
incorporate the area has a tax or levy, that will dramatically raise taxes<br/>
for the unincorporated citizens without much perceived benefit; The<br/>
unincorporated area has a substantial tax base and industry, and has designs<br/>
to incorporate itself into a new municipality; The unincorporated people<br/>
just don't like change.<br/>
<br/>
Unincorporated areas right next to incorporated, or unincorporated<br/>
surrounded by incorporated areas, can lead to some funny legalities.  We<br/>
could burn trash in our front yard, but our neighbors across the street<br/>
could only use the city trash company--the air polution of course stayed<br/>
nicely in the unincorporated area.  You could sell every illegal type of<br/>
firework in the unincorporated area to people who lived 2 blocks away in the<br/>
incorporated area--who of course only shot them off in the unincorporated<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Even more fun is when part of an incorporated area secceds from a<br/>
municipality and creates a new manicipality.  They usually end up<br/>
contracting back to the municipality they just left to provide the services<br/>
they can't economically justify building from scratch.<br/>

 $400 a year for a flippin' library card? That's insane! I've gotten<br/>
 library cards for all the different library networks in the metro<br/>
 Atlanta area, including a university library, and I've never been<br/>
 charged anything.<br/>
<br/>
 That's insane. I'd relocate just based on that insidious treachery.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">People who are unincorporated pay taxes.....just not always for all the same<br/>
things that people inside town, village, or city boundaries do.<br/>
<br/>
Here in DuPage County, people who live outside town boundaries get their<br/>
police service from the county sheriff's department.  And they either get<br/>
their fire protection service from the township (we also have township<br/>
government here in addition to county government), and they get street<br/>
repairs/road maintenance from the township. So people will pay taxes thru<br/>
their property taxes for police and fire protection and for the roads.  They<br/>
generally have wells and septic systems so they won't pay any money for<br/>
those utilities.  And they pay the same amount out of their taxes for<br/>
education since school district boundaries have nothing really to do with<br/>
town boundaries.  For example, School District 45, which I live in, takes in<br/>
part of Villa Park, part of Lombard, part of Oakbrook Terrace, and the<br/>
unincorporated areas around those towns.  As far as animal control goes,<br/>
towns around here generally have their own animal control officer with a<br/>
"pound" being a contract with one or more local vets who have a contract<br/>
with that town to board stray animals temporarily.  Unincorporated areas use<br/>
DuPage County Animal Control.  The towns use DCAC also, but just not as the<br/>
"first line of defense."  And the county doesn't have a county library<br/>
system, so unincorporated folks are on their own for that.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know about other towns in the area, but even if a person doesn't<br/>
have a library card, they can still all the functions that the library<br/>
offers AT the library.  They just can't check out anything from the library<br/>
and take it home with them.  So they can still come in and use our library's<br/>
computer system to go online, and any reference materials, even sit down and<br/>
read a book as long as they don't leave the library with it.  Nobody asks to<br/>
see a person's library card when they walk in the door -- just when they try<br/>
to check something out.<br/>
<br/>
Around here, a lot of people DON'T want to incorporate because they DON'T<br/>
want the extra taxes.  And the towns generally would like nothing better<br/>
than to get the tax dollars by incorporating them.  But as long as the<br/>
unincorporated chunk of land is larger than a certain size (can't remember<br/>
exactly what that is now, I THINK it's 200 acres but I'm not sure), the<br/>
people can't be forcibly annexed.  That's one reason why towns will court<br/>
certain homeowners who are on the edges of the unincorporated areas, to try<br/>
to get enough people to annex so that the unincorporated area is whittled<br/>
down to a small enough size that the town can then come in and forcibly<br/>
annex it.<br/>
<br/>
We had a problem locally with a church that wanted to annex because it<br/>
wanted city water and sewer.  And, being a church, it wouldn't have to pay<br/>
property taxes, since bonafide religious institutions are exempt from<br/>
property taxes.  So it was a we-can't-lose decision for the church.  But by<br/>
annexing the church, the rest of the area would be just under the minimum<br/>
needed not to be forcibly annexed by the town. So the area homeowners paid a<br/>
quiet visit to the church officials and I won't go into who said what to<br/>
whom at the private meeting, but the church withdrew their annexation<br/>
request.   Causing sadness amongst the town officials who had seen dollar<br/>
signs from the increased property tax dollars.<br/>

I have never heard of areas that are unincorporated.  They don't pay<br/>
taxes... but what about emergency services?  Will the closest fire dept not<br/>
go to those areas?  Do they not get to go to public school?  Why wouldn't a<br/>
city or town close by an unincorporated area WANT to incorporate them (if<br/>
that is the term) so that they would get taxed?  It's confusing to me.<br/>

  It's not treachery in that those people aren't paying any taxes that go to<br/>
  support any library system. Our county doesn't have a county library. So<br/>
  anyone who lives in an unincorporated area doesn't pay a single dime of<br/>
  taxes, either thru their own property tax or thru a landlord paying<br/>
property<br/>
  taxes, that goes to support a library.<br/>
<br/>
  In our area, if a person has a library card for one library, they can walk<br/>
  into a ton of other libraries in the area and check out books with the<br/>
card<br/>
  they have from their own town's library. It's a reciprocal service type of<br/>
  thing. They can walk into my town's library, and I can walk into their<br/>
  town's library. But these are people who live in unincorporated areas so<br/>
  they have absolutely no library card to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
  So if I'm paying to support the library thru my property taxes or thru the<br/>
  rent I pay my landlord, why should I be happy if a family who doesn't<br/>
  support any libary at all is able to take books out of my town's library?<br/>
<br/>
  If the people could afford to live in town, they do. A lot of them rent in<br/>
  unincorporated areas because there are more slumlords in the<br/>
unincorporated<br/>
  areas with cheaper rents and with far less restrictions on occupancy<br/>
  numbers. Right now it's actually occupancy numbers more than rent that are<br/>
  THE big thing in our area. There are poverty level families that will<br/>
  squeeze an extended family of 15 or 16 people or more into a two bedroom<br/>
  apartment or townhouse. Or poorer families who own their own homes will<br/>
  turn those homes into "boarding houses" for extra weekly cash, something<br/>
  that tends to be strictly controlled by towns and villages but not so much<br/>
  by the county if the house is in an unincorporated area. Altho the county<br/>
  does at least come down on people who turn their unattached garages into<br/>
  "boarding houses" -- if they find out about it.<br/>

I live in western Washington, about an hour south of Seattle.  I have <br/>
lived in an "unincorporated" area my whole life, but had to move to <br/>
stay that way.  The nearby city has "incoporated," or annexed, <br/>
portions of this area in the past, and it was just for that purpose:  <br/>
taxes.  Perhaps I'm simply biased and resentful, but the city claimed <br/>
that our taxes would actually be less once annexed as an incentive for <br/>
voters.  The majority of the area annexed, however, was not <br/>
residential, but included several grocery stores and strip malls as <br/>
well as the major regular mall in the area.  The city selected just <br/>
enough of residential areas that they could get votes for the <br/>
annexation out of them, and now get revenue from all the areas <br/>
annexed, including the commercial districts, which do not have the <br/>
number of voter residences.  Is this making sense?  Not sure I'm <br/>
explaining it clearly...  In any case, the result was that my <br/>
neighborhood was suddenly part of the city, and not only did our taxes <br/>
not go down, they actually went up.  See, that lower taxes promise was <br/>
under the premise that you did not own a decent chunk of property, <br/>
which my family did, and now had to pay higher taxes on.  (Also, our <br/>
address changed, which confused people to NO end...Did you move?  No.  <br/>
Then why do you have a change of address?)<br/>
<br/>
So we moved about five blocks south and are out of the city, once <br/>
more.  Until, that is, the commercial properties take over more of the <br/>
formerly residential areas...  Then I'll have to get back to you.<br/>
