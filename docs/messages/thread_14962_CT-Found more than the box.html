On July 7th, I happened to meet up with Wanda as she was stamping <br/>
into Circle of life series.  She, also, found a pornographic mag.  I <br/>
don't remember who placed the series, but will find out and suggest <br/>
that this last box b3e moved.<br/>

I (Small Bear) placed this series. I was out to Merrow Park a week ago or so <br/>
replacing the original boxes with more durable rubbermaids, and saw one <br/>
person sitting right next to the last hollow tree, and another swimming in <br/>
the river. Next time I get a chance I will relocate box #4, sorry for other <br/>
people's unpublic habits be out in public!<br/>
