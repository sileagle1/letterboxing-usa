Directions series in Cornwall, CT, I'm cross-posting this message to <br/>

=============<br/>
We arrived in Connecticut late Friday night and spent the weekend <br/>
hunting for "The Four Directions" boxes (and a few others).<br/>
<br/>
2 of the "Jonah's Whalers" joined us for the West series on <br/>
Saturday.  It was great to hike with some local boxers and that 2-<br/>
year old Jonah is QUITE the hiker (and smart to boot).  That little <br/>
guy made it almost the whole way on his own, touching each blue blaze <br/>
along the way (with a lift from dad to reach it of course!).  Our <br/>
group was pleased to find all the boxes in the series.  After that, <br/>
they dropped us on one end of the South series so we could hike back <br/>
to our car.  We did this series "backwards", but didn't have any <br/>
trouble finding the boxes (although that "poorly maintained" section <br/>
of the trail DID live up to its description...).<br/>
<br/>
On Sunday we did the North and West, each round trip.<br/>
<br/>
Unbelievably, we found each and every box in EXCELLENT condition!  <br/>
The Indian spirits must be protecting them, since these boxes are now <br/>
4 years old and many had not been visited for 2 years.<br/>
<br/>
This was a very interesting series - informative Indian lore, nice <br/>
hikes, some cool logbooks and a wide variety of carving styles.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who recommended the series to us, thanks to all <br/>
the carvers and logbook creators, and special thanks to Koyote for <br/>
creating the series!!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has questions about any specific boxes, feel free to <br/>
contact us off-list.<br/>

P.S.  We're hoping to head up Bear Mountain tomorrow, then will be <br/>
heading north into MA, then into VT on Thursday.<br/>
