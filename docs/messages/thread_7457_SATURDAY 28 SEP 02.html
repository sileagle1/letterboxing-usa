&gt;Hi - This looks like a great event and I'll let you know if I can <br/>
&gt;make it.  In the meantime, I thought you should know that the <br/>
<br/>
days and <br/>
&gt;the dates don't match.  Are you looking at last year's calendar?  <br/>

&gt;&gt; Alright everyone,<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The reservations have been made and the plans are in motion....<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Mark your calendars....<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Date:          Saturday 29 September 2002<br/>
&gt;&gt; Time:          8 am - 3 pm <br/>
&gt;&gt; Location:     Pocahontas State Park<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; General Information: Just 20 miles from downtown Richmond, the <br/>
&gt;&gt; capital of Virginia, Pocahontas State Park has been one of the <br/>
<br/>
more <br/>
&gt;&gt; popular parks in the state park system. Swift Creek forms the <br/>
&gt;nucleus <br/>
&gt;&gt; of the park, which is centered in a wildlife management area.<br/>
&gt;&gt;  <br/>
&gt;&gt; First, I have a few questions/challenges for all those that <br/>
<br/>
wish to <br/>
&gt;&gt; participate in the shindig!<br/>
&gt;&gt;  <br/>
&gt;&gt; a. Food: Pot Luck; we need to kind of spread out the menu <br/>
<br/>
amongst <br/>
&gt;&gt; each other. That way we don't all bring drinks and dessert. So <br/>
&gt;please <br/>
&gt;&gt; start volunteering what you would like to bring. You can e-mail <br/>
<br/>
your <br/>
&gt;&gt; choice either to me (KBuquet@A...) or Marsha <br/>
&gt;&gt; (mlgainey@y...)<br/>
&gt;&gt;  <br/>
&gt;&gt; b. Submit a carved stamp to me (or the list) for judging by the <br/>
<br/>
list <br/>
&gt;&gt; to be THE representative stamp of the "1st Annual East Coast <br/>
&gt;&gt; Letterboxing Meet/Greet" Submit stamp (image) No Later Than <br/>
<br/>
12:00 PM <br/>
&gt;&gt; FRIDAY 7 SEP 2002. Judging will be throughout the weekend of <br/>
<br/>
8-9 Sep <br/>
&gt;&gt; 02 (by members of the list of course). With the winning stamp <br/>
&gt;&gt; presented to the list on Monday 10 Sep 02. Once the winning <br/>
<br/>
stamp <br/>
&gt;has <br/>
&gt;&gt; been chosen I will design a *commemorative poster* for the <br/>
<br/>
event. It <br/>
&gt;&gt; will have a blank area at the bottom for everyone to stamp <br/>
<br/>
their <br/>
&gt;&gt; *signature stamp* on. Then I will scan all of the stamps, add <br/>
<br/>
them <br/>
&gt;to <br/>
&gt;&gt; the poster digitally, and print the final poster up. Copies <br/>
<br/>
will be <br/>
&gt;&gt; available to all members of the event about one week after we <br/>
&gt;&gt; conclude our shindig. It should only cost a few bucks per copy!<br/>
&gt;&gt;  <br/>
&gt;&gt; c. Submit brief bio of yourself, LetterBoxing family/group for <br/>
&gt;&gt; inclusion into the "program" that I am doing up for the <br/>
<br/>
shindig. <br/>
