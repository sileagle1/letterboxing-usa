   #1)  Monument Mt. box (Great Barrington) is in fine shape. I <br/>
replaced torn plastic bag log book was in). NEXT time we'll climb to <br/>
the peak!!<br/>
<br/>
  #2) Norman Rockwell box (Lenox) is also fine. Sap from that big old <br/>
pine dripped onto my logbook, so 2 pages keep sticking together.:-/<br/>
<br/>
  #3)  Eagle Ledge box (Lee - Oct. Mt. State Forest).The box is <br/>
fine.  It does require exact compass readings to find it.  The <br/>
logbook is hand made and really unique.  I love the stamp and it is <br/>
now one of my favorites. Only a handful of people have been here, <br/>
which is a shame. There is a nice network of trails to hike through <br/>
and the walk to the box is pleasant (bring skeeter repellant).<br/>
