Our 2 cents on this topic -- and we've not followed it too closely -- <br/>
so this may have already been said:<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is a family sport/hobby/past time. If you would not say <br/>
something to your mother/sister/spouse, then don't write it in the <br/>
log book. We try to use that ideal at our firehouse too in order to <br/>
promote a friendlier atmosphere. <br/>
<br/>
As far as ripping out pages from other's logbooks...thats personal <br/>
preference. We would highly suggest you email the placer so they can <br/>
go out and perform some box maintenence ASAP.  For those with kids -- <br/>
perhaps get in the habit of thumbing through the log before letting <br/>
the little ones paw through it?  Afterall, you DO make sure you know <br/>
what the little one is watching on TV, right!?!?  Same theory here. <br/>
