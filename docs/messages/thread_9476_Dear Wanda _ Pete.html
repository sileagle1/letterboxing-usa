I have the pleasure right now, of restoring Squirrels Washington <br/>
Monument box that has been badly damaged by rain for several months.  <br/>
The book was so wet that no one who found the box could look back <br/>
over it, so I am the first in a long time to read your notes from <br/>
April 2001.<br/>
"Thanks for getting me back to these old familiar spots from my <br/>
hiking days"  Your note of 20,00+ miles of solo long distance <br/>
backpacking is impressive to say the least, and some how it's special <br/>
to know you were up here when you and Pete had only 307 finds!<br/>
The book is a neat piece of history for this hobby, having been out <br/>
there since 2000, and I will return it to Squirrel soon so she can <br/>
enjoy the 2 year old log as well.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holiday Boxing to all<br/>
