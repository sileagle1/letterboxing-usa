                    <div class="plaintext-content">The following is geared toward women, but applies equally to men that hike<br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
If you carry Pepper Spray, just keep in mind that Pepper Spray does not work<br/>
on all people. There are also different levels of the spray based on<br/>
capsaicin content. Some people seem immune from it, especially more common<br/>
in those with mental disabilities and those on drugs. I was a Police Officer<br/>
for 8.5 years in some of the rougher areas of Cincinnati and I have found<br/>
out first hand that it doesn't always work as planned. I also know of<br/>
officers that sprayed themselves because they didn't pay attention to the<br/>
wind direction, thankfully, they had close back up or it could have been<br/>
really ugly.<br/>
<br/>
Also keep in mind that if you choose to use any type of weapon (walking<br/>
stick, taser, knife, gun, etc.) Be sure you know how to use it effectively<br/>
and safely and are committed to really using it before you make the attempt<br/>
with it. Otherwise, if you just use it as a threat, without being able to<br/>
'back up' the threat, or you don't make the first hit really effective, it<br/>
is much more likely that the attacker will take the weapon and use the<br/>
weapon on you.  Especially if there are multiple attackers.<br/>
<br/>
Cell phones are also excellent tools to have (&amp; I always carry one), but<br/>
face it, response time of officers who have probably never been on the<br/>
trails would be slow at best, so just don't expect them to ride up like a<br/>
knight in shining armor :-) That being said, it would be to your benefit to<br/>
call 911 if you get in an uncomfortable situation, because the calls are all<br/>
recorded. Important things to tell them first are your specific location (of<br/>
course) and probably even what trails the officers would need to take at<br/>
intersections to get to you, also a specific description of the person that<br/>
has you worried. If God forbid, something should go badly, the police need<br/>
to know who to look for! Keep in mind holding a cell phone takes the use of<br/>
one of your hands unless you have a hands free headset.<br/>
<br/>
Another option to have in your 'bag of tricks' is self defense training.<br/>
Several martial arts schools teach "women's self defense" courses. I<br/>
recommend Aikido, since strength is not a factor, however, practice is. I<br/>
would also recommend lots of practice of a few specific moves that you like.<br/>
What you need is the 'muscle memory' to do the move quickly without<br/>
thinking. Aikido has some very cool moves that you can learn, but I don't<br/>
know how receptive your particular area's dojo would be about teaching you<br/>
just a few moves. Most of the women's courses combine some Aikido moves with<br/>
punches and kicks.<br/>
<br/>
Your best weapon is your own gut feelings and common sense. If you get a bad<br/>
feeling about someone or a situation... TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS! You are<br/>
probably picking up on very subtle cues that your conscious mind doesn't<br/>
register. A large number of victims of violent crimes say that "they just<br/>
had a bad feeling" about the situation when there was still time to change<br/>
the outcome, but they chose to do nothing.<br/>
<br/>
And lastly, if you should ever get into a serious situation, your mental<br/>
state of mind is very important. Taking deep breaths will keep you more calm<br/>
and keep telling your self that you WILL SURVIVE. If you give up, you are<br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
OK, stepping off my soap box. Can you tell self defense and preservation is<br/>
deeply ingrained in me? It just tears me up when people are hurt due to a<br/>
lack of knowledge about some simple self defense tips.<br/>
<br/>
Stay safe out there!<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: To People who Hike Alone (PAM)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks for the tip on the apparent hideout of this strange person<br/>
&gt; here in CT. It seems once or twice a year since I've been on this<br/>
&gt; list, letterboxers report similar incidents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do almost all of my hiking alone. Pepper spray comes in all kinds<br/>
&gt; of containers that hook on to a belt loop or pack or slip into a<br/>
&gt; pocket. The devices have triggers that are intuitive to use even when<br/>
&gt; panicked. It's very inexpensive and readily available (on-line at<br/>
&gt; least) and is deliverable to most states (not NY). I generally carry<br/>
&gt; two with me...one small one, the size of an asthma inhaler, in my<br/>
&gt; pocket and a larger canister attached to my pack with velcro that is<br/>
&gt; a quick reach away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also have my cell phone hot keyed to 911 and readily available to<br/>
&gt; call in an emergency. My phone also has a feature that allows it to<br/>
&gt; be located via GPS when on line with 911.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In addition, the graphite tip on most trekking poles is sharp and<br/>
&gt; could be useful in case of an emergency. Overkill? Maybe, but better<br/>
&gt; to take these simple precautions if going solo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In my opinion, anyone who hikes alone without some effort to protect<br/>
&gt; themselves is taking too much of a risk, particularly in urban areas.<br/>
&gt; This has been said over and over on this list, but I think it's<br/>
&gt; important to trust your gut and if something looks or feels wrong,or<br/>
&gt; you find yourself getting into what I would call a "no-win" situation<br/>
&gt; whether it be an encounter with a strange person or threatening<br/>
&gt; animal, or terrain or conditions beyond your capabilities, no<br/>
&gt; letterbox is worth putting yourself in jeopardy.<br/>

My dh loves his Glock! LOL He doesn't go anywhere without it.  Thanks for the <br/>
"lecture." I carried pepper spray in college and never tried to use it.  When <br/>
I was told that it would be nice to "try it out" so I would know how if <br/>
needed nothing sprayed out of the container! I was so glad I had never needed it.<br/>
