We are the current foster parents of the lost baby needeep hh.  We <br/>
picked him up at the gathering and will find a good home for him as <br/>
soon as possible.  I think it had a rough stay at the Pine Barrens of <br/>
RI.  Wanda &amp; Pete brought it there after they picked it up at the <br/>
Delaware State Stamp.  Sunshine and Swamp Yankee pick it up there on <br/>
5/16/03 and said the box was ransacked.  They repaired it and brought <br/>
it to the gathering, where we picked it up.  I hope that fills all <br/>
the gaps!  <br/>
