<div>Morningsong,</div>
<div>My husband and I are also new to letterboxing, and 
our first find was at Sugarloaf. I had read that the Windsor box was missing, so 
we didn't even go there. The trip to Sugarloaf was wonderful, and we had a great 
hike. But, there was no water at the falls this time of year. We are planning on 
going back up to hike more in the spring, and hopefully see the falls. 
</div>
<div>We're also in the North Bay; Petaluma. We are 
planning on going out to find more letterboxes soon.</div>

<div>Hi... My husband and I are new to letterboxing 
  and are very excited at the prospect of getting out in the woods and seeing 
  all the great possibilities.  I eagerly carved a stamp and we set out to 
  find one of the only two boxes in our area of the Northern Bay Area.  We 
  had a great time searching for the Windsor, CA LB that was listed on the web 
  site.  Unfortunately, we were unable to find it (you can imagine our 
  disappointment, this being our first box and all).  I think we were in 
  the right place, but there were a lot of downed logs and didn't have any 
  luck.  If whoever planted this box is lurking on this list, you might 
  want to check on it.  It could be that we just couldn't find it because 
  of our own inexperience, but otherwise it is MIA.  I guess now we will go 
  and attempt the Sugarloaf box as well as boxes south and east of us.  Be 
  on the lookout for boxes we have planned for the future that will hopefully 
  show off the beauty of wine country and the Northern CA coast.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome! I live down in the southern end of the S.F. Bay Area. There <br/>
are numerous boxes down here that you can hunt for if you are <br/>
suffering from letterboxingitis. Just be careful hunting for the <br/>
boxes in the Palo Alto area because most of them are missing. I am in <br/>
the process of incorporating my Cradle box into a new set of clues <br/>
called The Alameda Creek, which is located in the Fremont area. I <br/>
will be posting the clues for that series very soon. Just wait a week<br/>
(or more), and then there will be more boxes.;)<br/>
