Not sure but below for box three it should read "back in it's home nicely" and for box four it should read 20ish paces to #4. If the webmaster could check that it would be great thanks!<br/>
<br/>

"Back on the trail and past the group of 3 but before the next curve in the road a stump holds box #3. Please be sure to secure the box back in it’s home nicely. Watch for trail users, its close to the path. <br/>
<br/>
Around the gully and curve down we go just past a very holy &amp; tall tree stump is a fallen log 20…paces to #4. "<br/>
