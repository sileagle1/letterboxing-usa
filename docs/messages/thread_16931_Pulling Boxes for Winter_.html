   Here and on another listserve I have seen a couple of posts about <br/>
pulling boxes for the winter.  Is this the norm for New England? (I <br/>
couldn't box last winter due to an injury, and wasn't reading the <br/>

I assume placers[removers?] will put something on the clue <br/>

I will be disappointed if a lot of boxes go away. Snow levels go up <br/>
and down and I was hoping to get in a some boxing walks this winter <br/>
to keep from feeling housebound. <br/>
<br/>
I am not planning to take mine out. I think they will survive the <br/>
winter, even if they are a bit lonely.<br/>

If you didn't see anything posted on the list serve assume the box is still out there. I boxed last winter with no problems of being where a box had been pulled.<br/>

I do not intend to pull them for the winter. First of<br/>
all, we've got almost 40 boxes out there at this<br/>
point. Don't want to take the time to go and get them<br/>
all. Second, we try to be careful with our placements,<br/>
avoiding places that we think might be prone to<br/>
flooding or accidental discovery. Last, we usually<br/>
experience several thaws over the course of the New<br/>
England winter (last winter being the exception to the<br/>
rule), and if the boxes aren't out there, then no one<br/>
can find them during those oh-so-short times when<br/>
hiking doesn't leave a trail that anyone can follow.<br/>

I'll be testing them for you this coming week.  We're going to my<br/>
mother-in-law's place in Syracuse for Thanksgiving.  And I'm grateful<br/>
that you haven't pulled your boxes, because the other ones in Syracuse<br/>
have already been pulled for the winter (I contacted the placer to<br/>
verify.)<br/>
