&gt; Does anyone know if there are any letterboxes near Geneva, <br/>
Switzerland?  Is <br/>
&gt; there a European website for letterboxing?  I wasn't able to pull <br/>
anything <br/>
&gt; up through Google.  Thanks.<br/>

then, you better believe that I would have placed boxes along the <br/>
way.  I also spent time in Asia a few years ago and I would have <br/>
done the same there.  There may be a possibility that we will move <br/>
to Europe or Asia in the future (next couple of years) and I <br/>
definitely will place letterboxes when I go.  I just hope, that <br/>
before that time--if it ever were to come, that others who also <br/>
share such a similar passion for the sport will start placing boxes <br/>
in their own areas which might, in turn, encourage others to get <br/>
involved and place boxes in their neat and interesting locations.  <br/>
What a fantastic sport!!!<br/>
