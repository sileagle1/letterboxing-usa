<br/>
Thanks for the update about our dear friend Sylly (who would respectfully like you to know that he is a boy!). We are still waiting for the real Sylly and Sally to return from their winter vacation to spend summer in our backyard. For all those other catbird lovers out there, here's a piccie of Sylly in the bath! :-))<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">So glad that we decided to bring Sylly the Catbird back to CT with us <br/>
after our last trip to PA! We'd brought him down to NJ last year on <br/>
our way to Florida, but from where we left him, he'd gotten moved to <br/>
a spot from which he prolly wouldn't have gotten to fly away for <br/>
quite a while! We debated leaving him there, but decided the CT <br/>
letterboxing crowd might appreciate passing him among their "fine <br/>
feathered friends"!  Happy to hear he's now back "on the wing", as is <br/>
the FFA HH that we also brought back from PA, and the Centibration HH <br/>
that we left up in Maine backpacking the 100-mile Wilderness last <br/>
September! Now, if only we'd hear something about that HH we brought <br/>
out to the Pacific Northwest last May - but perhaps they really DO <br/>
despise hitchers and store-bought stamps out there (although it looks <br/>
like all those "two-fers" we heard that Amanda was always complaining <br/>
about have finally helped her net a spot in the "500 Club" , so maybe <br/>
she can feel a little more friendly-disposed now towards the poor <br/>
homeless things - or send a few more of them out this way!!! :-)<br/>
Thanks for "keepin' em movin", and for those who send us updates!<br/>
