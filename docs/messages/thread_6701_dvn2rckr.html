<br/>
Hash House Harriers:  aka 'a drinking group with a running problem'<br/>
<br/>
   Hashing is independent of letterboxing (as far as I can tell so <br/>
far).  ;)  In essence, during a hash house harrier event, a hare <br/>
sets out a trail (with many false leads &amp; one true lead) with a <br/>
slight time advantage and a bit later the 'group' must try to catch <br/>
the 'hare' (or the person who sets the trail).  If the 'group' <br/>
catches the 'hare' then the 'hare' must buy a round of drinks for <br/>
the group, if the hare isn't caught then each member of the group <br/>
must buy a drink for the hare.  The events have been modified over <br/>
the years to include children appropriate themes or <br/>
other 'interesting' things.  The trail can range from extremely <br/>
short distances to over 10 km, depending on what sort of group <br/>
you're involved with.  <br/>
<br/>
     Our family enjoyed the hash runs because it enabled us to get <br/>
exercise without really feeling like you're exercising (because <br/>
you're too busy trying to figure out the clues so you can catch the <br/>
hare).  Otherwise, there's an entire culture <br/>
(language/code/nickname/decorum) that comes with hash house runs <br/>
that seems quite similar to that of letterboxing--or, at least, what <br/>
I've noticed so far in my few short months of letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
     Letterboxing, though, allows you to participate in the sport at <br/>
your leisure and your desired level of activity without <br/>
the 'pressure' of drinking at the end (which really enables children <br/>
to participate in most events).<br/>
<br/>
Does that help? <br/>
<br/>
See you on the trail...<br/>

No, seriously, I've just been heading out around the area trying to <br/>
get some exercise and I keep finding these really neat places that <br/>
deserve boxes!  The rains are coming soon, so the boxes either go <br/>
out now or next Spring.  I only have a few more left to place then <br/>
I'm taking a nice, long vacation (to look for some boxes most <br/>
likely).  Can you tell that it rained a couple of days last week?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">     Ok--here's the deal.  Not very much caffeine involved in the <br/>
process--just an injured former triathlete/swimmer who needs to get <br/>
some serious exercise on a daily basis.  The 2 little ones aren't <br/>
yet of 'formal' school age.  We are homeschooling--so they have <br/>
already started the education process (although, philosophically <br/>
speaking, do we ever stop learning?).  <br/>
<br/>
     Letterboxing works absolutely perfectly in tandem with <br/>
homeschooling, especially when you live in such a historically rich <br/>
area as we do here in the Pacific Northwest.  I use the treks for <br/>
their (and my) exercise (which is absolutely necessary for the 3 <br/>
year old--or she would never go to sleep at night), the interaction <br/>
with the flora, fauna &amp; natural surroundings for <br/>
science/nature/biology, the directions/clues for 'survival skill' <br/>
training (hey, it's never too early to start) and math application, <br/>
and other things just seem to fit into their own little categories <br/>
(historical things--history/social science, cultural things for <br/>
social science, etc).  Hey, it doesn't hurt to find boxes near <br/>
really cool playgrounds, too!!!  So that's where the kids are <br/>
concerned.  <br/>
<br/>
    For me personally, I haven't done 'adult' type things in a LONG <br/>
time.  Solving the clues/puzzles in searching for the letterboxes <br/>
has been a welcome challenge in my life.  I also haven't done <br/>
anything 'artsy' in years (perhaps decades--since I attended a <br/>
German school growing up).  Creating the stamps (which I still am <br/>
not very good at) is sort of a neat and interesting artistic outlet <br/>
for me.  Also, finding places to hide boxes is fun &amp; challenging.  <br/>
Isn't life great when you find an awesome, natural location to hide <br/>
a box!!!  SIDENOTE:  Since you started letterboxing, do you find <br/>
yourself looking at EVERYTHING with an eye to place boxes (even <br/>
urban nooks &amp; crannies when you're stopped at an intersection in <br/>
traffic)?  Finally, writing the clues (in an interesting way) is yet <br/>
another unique personal challenge for me.  So, in a nutshell, that <br/>
rationalizes my newfound obsession with letterboxing!  ;)  I think <br/>
these are some of the same reasons that scouting groups are so <br/>
involved in letterboxing, isn't it?  Plus it probably works well <br/>
with earning merit badges...  ;)  Seeking adventures in <br/>
letterboxing...<br/>
