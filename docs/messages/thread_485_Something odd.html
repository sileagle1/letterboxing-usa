                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear letterboxers,<br/>
Some of you are getting individual emails from an irate member of this list <br/>
whose messages have been moderated.  His emails were not forwarded from this <br/>
list.  I made a promise to disallow politics from this list, and I intend to <br/>
keep it.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not wish to participate in further debate over the politics of <br/>
letterboxing, you will have to contact the sender of these messages <br/>
personally and ask him to quit including you in his bulk emails.  As creator <br/>
and moderator of this list, I will not allow this to be a forum for an <br/>
ongoing debate over whether we need a website that is operated as a group <br/>
effort, or one that is controlled by a single individual.<br/>
<br/>
As I stated previously, this is now a moderated list.  I am not playing God.  <br/>
The list is moderated by a group, not by any one person.  There WILL be a new <br/>
website established especially for the members of this group.  It will not be <br/>
a mirror site of previous systems.  It will be a better site with innovative <br/>
features.  The decisions that must be made for operating this new website <br/>
will be made by members of this talk list, not by one individual.<br/>
<br/>
This is not an irrational, impulse decision on my part.  An outstanding <br/>
majority of the active members of this talk list have contacted me to suggest <br/>
that something of this nature be undertaken.  The people have claimed <br/>
letterboxing for themselves, against the wishes of those who would control it.<br/>
<br/>
It appears that nearly all of you wish to have your clues remain on the old <br/>
site as long as they are welcome there, but have them copied over to the new <br/>
site as well.  This is the approach I will be taking with my own clues.  <br/>
<br/>
There are no input forms to fill out to accomplish this.  Just let me know <br/>
(on list, or off) and I'll see that your clues end up on the new site.  No <br/>
need to update your bookmarks, either, as long as they currently point to <br/>
www.letterboxing.org.  As soon as the new site is operational, this domain <br/>
will be redirected to our new site.  <br/>
<br/>
Admittedly, I am serving as a spokesperson, at this time.  This is not <br/>
something I am doing alone, however.  The new site will be supported by a <br/>
group effort.  Webpage design and hosting will become a collaborative effort <br/>
of volunteers from around the country.  No one has the time to maintain our <br/>
website in a vaccuum.  Time restrictions were largely what prevented the old <br/>
site from being able to serve our needs realistically. Only this cooperative <br/>
network approach will provide the resources required to keep up with the <br/>
growth of our hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your patience during this time of transition.  It was best to <br/>
get this done, and let the dust settle as we begin the great Letterboxing <br/>
Summer of 1999.<br/>

Great news, Mitch!  Please do include my clues on the new site.  Also, could <br/>
you correct the spelling of the El Corazon letterbox, which has been listed <br/>
incorrectly as "El Corozan"?  A small change, but it matters, esp. to the <br/>
Spanish-speaking!  Thanks, and good luck to us all!<br/>

well.<br/>
<br/>
Can't we all just get along here?  This whole thing (the underpinnings of<br/>
which I really have little understanding...or care to understand) is<br/>
beginning to turn me off to a pastime that is fun and encourages people to<br/>
get out and hike.  I refuse to let that happen.  I like letterboxing too much.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line for me is that I don't really care too much about copyright<br/>
notices, clue formats, or who's pissed off at who.  What I care about is<br/>
that there's a place to publish my clues.  With all of this political B.S.<br/>
going on, it appears that the only way for me to be sure of this is to<br/>
publish them myself, and hope that people find my pages.  I won't publish<br/>
clues on any web site other than my own and will point people to the site.<br/>
This seems the best way for me to stay away from the "politics" that I<br/>
dislike so much.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who's worked to advance the hobby.  Thanks to everyone<br/>
who's been nice enought to offer me advice and help.  Thanks to everyone<br/>
who's taken the time and effort to visit my letterboxes.  Letterboxing in<br/>
the USA will go on, regardless of politics, and I (and I hope all of the<br/>
others) will continue as well.<br/>

Nobody agrees with your frustration more than I. I've done my best to<br/>
"mediate" and, apparently, not been successful.<br/>
<br/>
I would encourage people to avoid taking sides, and to publish your<br/>
clues on any sites which may arise out of this.  Eventually, I guess,<br/>
the most accepted formats will prevail.<br/>
<br/>
Until then, carve a stamp. take a hike, write a clue and find another.<br/>
<br/>
Patience<br/>
