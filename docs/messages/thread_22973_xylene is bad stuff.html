&gt; Regarding xylene -- before using any product of this type, please,<br/>
please contact the manufacturer and get the Material Safety Data<br/>
Sheet, or MSDS.  (The store you buy xylene from is supposed to provide<br/>
this for you, but often they don't.)  This sheet can be understood by<br/>
looking at the data sheet provided by Arts, Craft, and Theater Safety:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://www.artscraftstheatersafety.org/datasheets.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For legal reasons, they don't post data sheets online.  So you have<br/>
to request via email or snail mail.  They will answer questions over<br/>
the phone or via email -- FOR FREE!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of the best, most intricate carvers I know use the old pencil<br/>
transfer method.  Draw the most important lines on the *front* of you<br/>
drawing, flip your drawing over, tape it to the carving material, and<br/>
burnish the back of the paper with a pencil or spoon or burnishing<br/>
tool.  Voila!  Your image is on the carving block, and no brain cells<br/>
were harmed in the making of this project.<br/>
