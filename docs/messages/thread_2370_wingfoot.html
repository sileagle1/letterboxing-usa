When I went looking for the WEC box about a month ago I think I <br/>
remember seeing a sign saying that there had been some recent bear <br/>
activity in Norvin Green, though I didn't see one.  I guess they'll <br/>
get into anything.  <br/>
<br/>
On another note, I hope you don't mind, I plan on planting a box in a <br/>
park to the north of Norvin Green where you guys recently planted <br/>
one.  I had the stamp carved for a while, but it needed to be mounted <br/>
as it was too thin.  It's actually drying as I type this. Fortunately <br/>
we chose differnt names for the boxes. <br/>

I think it's great that someone else is planting boxes in northern NJ!   It<br/>
is my favorite part of the state and your box will just give us another<br/>
excuse to go up there.<br/>
