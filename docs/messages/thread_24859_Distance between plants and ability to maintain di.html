Me neither.  If I get a report from a geocacher that they have found one of<br/>
my boxes, I usually relocate my box so the logbook doesn't fill up with a<br/>
bunch of GC people logging in.  That's about it as far as I'm concerned.<br/>
I'm not going to spend my time on the GC website researching GC locations,<br/>
but if I find out my box is close, I'll move it.  I don't intentionally<br/>
place my boxes near other letterboxes, but if it so happens that a mystery<br/>
box is nearby that I am unaware of, well that's the way it goes. The people<br/>
that have figured out the Mystery box will be able to find 2 boxes in the<br/>
same vicinity.<br/>

<br/>
I think the intent of those requierments is good, but I am ever so grateful that letterboxers who travel have been willing to make plants in far flung places. For instance, there are quite a few boxes in the Caribbean, and I hope to plant a few there myself, that wouldn't be there if the owners had to be within 50 miles of their plant. JMHO.<br/>

Subject: [LbNA] Distance between plants and ability to maintain discussion<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In order to post a geocache that you hide you must meet a couple of <br/>
requirements. One is that you cannot plant another cache within 0.10 mi <br/>
of another cache and your home coordinates must be within 50 miles of <br/>
your cache so that you are close enough to maintain it. <br/>
<br/>
What are the pros and cons of adopting these requirements and how do <br/>
you feel about them?<br/>

If impact of objects' on the environment is the issue, I would argue<br/>
that placing less total objects, and making the clues to the objects<br/>
more difficult, is a much better way to tackle the problem than doing<br/>
so via proximity rules.  I would argue that each object placed adds<br/>
an incremental impact, which is primarily a function of its difficulty<br/>
and sensitivity of its location, not its proximity to something else.<br/>
<br/>
Put another way, if someone placed an object within 2 feet of one I've<br/>
placed, I assure you the impact of the one I've placed would not be<br/>
affected.<br/>
<br/>
The intent may be fine, but the implementation is downright silly.<br/>

&gt; What you are not taking into consideration is the increase in the <br/>
&gt; number of finders and if there are more and more boxes placed closer <br/>
&gt; to each other with more finders, all of which are not of the "leave <br/>
&gt; no trace philosophy, the implementation is not silly but necessary <br/>
&gt; especally in alpine and such sensitive stones."<br/>
<br/>
I can't even parse that, much less consider it.  Its even tougher<br/>
with a golden monkey (or two) on one's back, I'll admit ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm suggesting that impact is directly proportional to quantity<br/>
and difficulty of locating objects.  You seem to be suggesting that<br/>
there is a non-linear impact resulting from proximity of non-related<br/>
objects.  I'm disputing the latter.  In fact, I'm 100% certain that<br/>
objects placed by me do not increase the impact of proximate unrelated<br/>
objects placed by others, and that those selfsame objects do not<br/>
increase the impact of objects placed by myself.  Further, I assert<br/>
that if concern for the environment is the true motivating issue,<br/>
the remedy is less objects, and less visits to the objects placed,<br/>
not silly 528 foot rules.<br/>
<br/>
Intelligent people are free to disagree on these points; all we need<br/>
is to find the intelligent people :-).  Be all that as it may, you,<br/>
or anyone else, are free to not place an object within 528 feet of<br/>
one I've placed, if you want to.<br/>

PS, if this rule were implemented in Chester County, about 24500<br/>
objects could still be placed (not including mine, which will not<br/>
be observing the 528 foot rule).  Thought y'all would like to know<br/>
that.  I certainly was curious.<br/>

<br/>
Another problem with them is that the people making them are<br/>
not qualified to do so.  As was alluded to in a few other<br/>
posts in this thread, what science has determined that the<br/>
528 foot rule has any desired effect other than keeping<br/>
objects 528 feet apart?<br/>
<br/>
If the environment is the concern, density policies should<br/>
be set on a location by location basis the by people managing<br/>
the location, not by remote web site operators or people<br/>
placing the objects.  Also, as has been previously pointed<br/>
out by others, many letterboxers do not use GPS devices or<br/>
web sites capable of enforcing these rules anyway).  And<br/>
I'd bet most geocachers do not look for objects outside the<br/>
particular web site they happen to be using.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, here's a little math quiz based on this for the<br/>
interested.  Assuming the 528 foot rule is enforced, and<br/>
assuming regular hexagonal tessellation, approximately<br/>
how many objects could be placed in French Creek State<br/>
Park?<br/>
<br/>
1) 36<br/>
2) 336<br/>
3) 1036<br/>
4) 3336<br/>
5) 10336<br/>
6) French Creek has too many trees to assume an object can<br/>
be placed at the exact center of a regular hexagon<br/>
<br/>

We're having a bit of an issue here with boxes too. there's no shortage of parkland up here, yet in<br/>
one case, someone planted 6 boxes in a  180 acre park that already had 5 boxes.  Now I could see if<br/>
they were park specific boxes.. Maybe had some historical or even emotional connection to said park,<br/>
but we're talking random store bought stamps (she says as she ducks the flying inkpads).  For people<br/>
who put so little thought in to placement, it has to be about the numbers.  Wanting boxers get a<br/>
load of their boxes without doing some real work.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some days the park gets its fair share of traffic and you wind up walking it with the same people<br/>
who can't HELP but notice you loitering while they pass on. or walk off trail to get the box.  It's<br/>
happened a couple of times. boxes on top of boxes. <br/>

Yes it is.  I'm having fun with it.  Turning the list<br/>
into my personal blog on the subject.  But, just like<br/>
all these unwanted boxes and geocaches, easy to ignore.<br/>

Of course, by the 528 foot rule, such a park can hold about<br/>
32 boxes.  (BTW, for those feverishly doing the math on<br/>
my quiz, I was off by a factor of 4.  Oh well, tough to<br/>
keep those radii and diameters straight when it is too<br/>

&gt; Maybe had some historical or even emotional connection <br/>

Or perhaps part of a complicated puzzle.  I assure you<br/>
it has been done before with random store bought stamps<br/>
and trivial boxes.  How else is one to cover one's tracks?<br/>

It just goes to show, who is to judge these things, and<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I find it to be impossible to even enforce such an idea since letterboxes arent geo-referenced anywhere. As analog as letterboxing is I dont exactly see letterboxers out in the world with tape measures even voluntarily trying to adhere to the guidelines to keep them .1 miles from each other.<br/>
<br/>
For clarification, the .1 mile guideline is a guideline not a hard and fast rule. Although saturation is one reason for the guideline it is also a practical one. Caches too close together can often be confused with each other. As referenced in this mailing list you will often find a cache at a good letterbox hiding space. If theres a natural barrier that can differentiate two caches the .1 mile guideline is waived.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, Id caution the letterboxers on this list not to pooh pooh the geocaching community to inflate their own personal ego that letterboxing is right while geocaching is wrong. Often we deal with a lot of issues that the letterboxing community has yet to realize due to the very nature of the activity. Saying that letterboxers are more or less environmentally conscious is wrong  its just that letterboxers in its secretive nature isnt as public as geocaching is. We as geocachers have to keep an ongoing positive relationship with land managers which ultimately benefits you in letterboxing. <br/>

<br/>
I will admit that the impact on the environment is in relation to how <br/>
difficult the item is to find. Now, geocahers are at a disadvantage <br/>
here, becasue they just like to give coordinates and not clues (they <br/>
do have that opton that I wish more would use especally in "hiding <br/>
spot" rich locations). No matter how clever and intellegent a placer <br/>
writes his or her clues, there is the potential to have people have <br/>
to look around in order to find their box. I believe that the more <br/>
boxes in a close area the higher the impact on the area.<br/>
<br/>
Let me give an example. There is a cache hidden about 400 feet off <br/>
trail. There is a logical exit point from the trail that myself and <br/>
the five other finders have used. This path takes you across a lichen <br/>
covered sheet of rock, that shows and will show the passing of the <br/>
people that found that cache. I walked around and didn't add to the <br/>
disfigurement of nature. There are a lot of lichen coveredrocks in <br/>
the area and if you hid a letterbox within 100 feet of that cache, no <br/>
matter how clever your clues are, there is going to be an increase in <br/>
the impact on the land. <br/>

If you are really concerned about impact then just make your clues a <br/>
bit more obscure.<br/>
<br/>
I believe Randy did cover this aspect of letterboxing but many just <br/>
overlooked this point. Try looking for a Map Surfer box sometime!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing has had many of its concepts "dumbed down". Look how <br/>
many drivebys there are (yes we have planted some ourselves).<br/>
<br/>
Make your clues tougher so that they aren't found by everyone just <br/>
walking 50 steps along the main trail under the first oak on your <br/>
left.<br/>
<br/>
Now to Jeremy's points.<br/>
<br/>
Please don't try to be so high and mighty. We (Gwen and Don) have had <br/>
one of our letterbox location usurped by a Geocacher placing the <br/>
cache directly under our letterbox.<br/>
 We have had several of our stamps go missing in some of our "marked" <br/>
letterboxes and the Geocacherswrote in the logbooks that they really <br/>
liked the stamp!<br/>
Several of our letterboxes in a series were used as gps points for <br/>
the geocacher's cache.<br/>
Anytime we have a letterbox and a geocache moves into the area, we <br/>
move our box. It is just easier than to hassle trying to get our <br/>
stamps back.<br/>
<br/>
While generally you do a good at groundspeak, I don't think it is so <br/>
great that it can't use a little prodding.<br/>
<br/>
You are right the two hobbies/games are just different enough that <br/>
the same exact rules will not work.<br/>
<br/>
You think Geocaching is the best, many of us just differ in our <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>

Nature's Niche: Real Life Scavenger Hunt<br/>
Tuesday 10am-Noon<br/>
(Ages 50 &amp; Up)<br/>
Letterboxing is a real-life scavenger hunt that started in England in<br/>
1854 with a calling card hidden in a bottle.  Over the years it has<br/>
grown into apopular internationalhobby, with thousands of letterboxes<br/>
hidden all over the world.  Come learn the basics of this hobby to get<br/>
started.  You will create your own unique rubber stamp, find hidden<br/>
boxes and get a chance to hide your own letterbox.  (Reservations<br/>
begin April 29.)<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me they can't be too opposed to it if they're teaching people<br/>
to do it.<br/>

<br/>
I beg to differ with this statement. Imagine receiving the following <br/>
update on one of your boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Planter, <br/>
Your box/cache has been found and can be retrieved at the park office.<br/>
Signed,<br/>
Your Friendly neighborhood Park Ranger<br/>
<br/>
Now, off you go to the park to retrieve your box/cache. However, when <br/>
you arrive, you are handed your box, and a $300 fine for littering. <br/>
<br/>
Trust me, if the parks wanted to ban all boxes and caches and make some <br/>
money off if them, they could. Every single letterbox and geocache is <br/>
technically litter. Just my two cents and the two cents of a ranger at <br/>
a local preserve where a geo-cache was seized a couple of months ago <br/>
that contained drugs, drug paraphenalia, and pornography.<br/>

&gt; In order to post a geocache that you hide you must meet a couple of <br/>
&gt; requirements. One is that you cannot plant another cache within 0.10 mi <br/>
&gt; of another cache and your home coordinates must be within 50 miles of <br/>
&gt; your cache so that you are close enough to maintain it. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What are the pros and cons of adopting these requirements and how do <br/>
&gt; you feel about them?<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
I am with Randy on this one, I won't be adopting them either.  I plant <br/>
boxes near and far, and if any of the current databases tell me I have <br/>
to do it the way they want me to do it, then I will simply not post my <br/>
clues there.  There are plenty of outlets for clues, including my own <br/>
website and this list.<br/>
<br/>
They can do their own thing, I have no problem with Geocaching, but this <br/>
is not Geocaching and I don't play that game, nor do I want to.  <br/>
Letterboxing, I feel, is much more organic in its nature.  There is <br/>
greater creativity, from the logbooks, to the locations, to the stamps <br/>
and boxes themselves and the clues.  Sure, there are plenty of little <br/>
boxes, boxes placed simply to place a box, but at the same time there <br/>
are a ton of boxes out there that are extremely innovative, clever and <br/>
creative.  I think the way in which letterboxing is done, with clues and <br/>
a stamp, alone allows for better boxes that I can imagine being <br/>
conceived with the geocaching method.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing for you to do, instead of asking repeated questions <br/>
comparing letterboxing to geocaching, is to simply get out there and <br/>
box, and see what you find.<br/>

If someone plants a box in a questionable location, where its discovery <br/>
is likely to tarnish the reputation of the hobby, then it is up to the <br/>
more experienced members of the LB community to try to contact the <br/>
placer and instruct them. <br/>
