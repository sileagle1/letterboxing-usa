<div>Hello and happy spring.</div>
<div>We were out on Nantucket this past week and, of 
course, checked out all the letterboxes.  We found four in good shape- 
Great Point, Sankaty Light, Daffodil Festival and "Nantucket".  We were 
unable to find Brandt Point or TailGate.  We really scoured the area at 
both of those spots and came up emptyhanded.  In particular, at TailGate- 
there was lots of rubbish in the gully- broken bottles and trash, seems it might 
be a party spot or something- and perhaps it was picked up.  Brandt Point 
we have no idea- as the clues seemed very clear, but we still could not 
find it.  Great Point was our favorite- well worth the trip on a glorious 
sunny day.  There have been many visitors to that one- more than the 
others, I think, which seems wonderful, especially since it is such a trek to 
get out there.  Anyway, wanted to update.  Hope everyone is having a 
great letterboxing spring and that your travels take you out to the beautiful 
island for a visit.</div>
