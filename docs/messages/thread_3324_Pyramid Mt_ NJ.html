<br/>
<br/>Mary and I found 2 of your 3 letterboxes this afternoon.  The only reason we didn't find the 3rd is because we didn't go back that way, and were too tired to go back up to look for it.
<br/>
<br/>There were 4 stamps in each book and everythings was safe and dry.  We're new to the sport and don't yet have a stamp but will return when we do.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks so much, it's fun to use the compass skills I never thought I get a chance to.
<br/>
