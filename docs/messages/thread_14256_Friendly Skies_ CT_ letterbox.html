in the park I had not found yet. While there, it seemed like a nice <br/>
moment to pull out the Merrow Park letterbox logbook to read who has <br/>
visited lately.  I got caught redhanded with letterbox contents all <br/>
about me!  It was a distinct pleasure to meet up with Wanda, of the <br/>
famous Pete and Wanda duo. (She hikes quickly and very quietly!!) She <br/>
helped me find Friendly Skies--incredibly nice stamp!  and I trailed <br/>
along as she logged into the Circle of Life Series. It was most <br/>
enjoyable to have a chance to chat with Wanda.  I hope to meet up <br/>
with her again, along with all you other local letterbox devotees.<br/>
