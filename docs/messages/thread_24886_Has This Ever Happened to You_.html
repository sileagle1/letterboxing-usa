I was up in Maine planting a box over the weekend (I even listed it<br/>
online, as it is rather celebratory and elegiac and I wanted it to be<br/>
egalitarian.)  I found some nice stamps at the area lighthouses <br/>
easy boxes right off of the parking lot (Pemaquid even has a restaurant,<br/>
gift shop, and a soda machine!)  Moreover, these clues were clear and<br/>
easy to follow, not so for these other clues!<br/>
<br/>
My dilemma is this: I do not know if it is against the "rules"<br/>
to reveal too much of the clue here, but I need to complain, and see if<br/>
anyone else feels the same.  Anyway, I stopped in on another (WOM) box<br/>
in Lincoln County and had a rough time of it.  To start, it was very hot<br/>
and muggy, and the skeeters were horrible.<br/>
<br/>
I had to find the place first, which happens to be on the Damariscotta<br/>
River, where it is more ocean than river.  I had to park by a modest<br/>
sign along the road and walk down someone's driveway (the name<br/>
`Richardson' was on the white gate.)  It was near 1:29 when I<br/>
finally found it!  What at first looked like a trail marker was just a<br/>
Nature Conservancy boundary marker, and I had to continue further up the<br/>
drive to find an orange-blazed trail.  Not mentioned in the clues.<br/>
<br/>
I knew I was looking for a white blazed trail, and one bisects the<br/>
orange loop.  Again, I had to walk the whole thing to discover that I<br/>
needed to find one of the two white spurs that come off the orange trail<br/>
along the water.  Part of the trail near the water runs along some<br/>
steep, rocky terrain  I'm glad I didn't have to push a<br/>
stroller through here!  Again, a mention of this in the clues would have<br/>
been helpful, or I would not have worn flip-flops.  I needed to find a<br/>
lone spruce growing on a Point at trails end, then walk back 16 paces to<br/>
find the box between two stones.  There are many spruces, and the stones<br/>
were not obvious; they were not even on the trail!  In addition, there<br/>
was no mention if a pace was one step or two.  A note to visit during<br/>
high tide should have been included.  There were some pretty, hidden<br/>
coves along the trail that would have looked like colored gems if the<br/>
water were higher.<br/>
<br/>
Many local boxes are much easier than this one, and have much better<br/>
directions.  Maybe that's why the clue wasn't posted online.  (I<br/>
even had to Google "Bawds of Euphony" to learn what the name<br/>
meant, and that the image of mermaids singing can be a metaphor for<br/>
foolish fantasy and the unobtainable.)  I don't even know if I<br/>
should continue on with what else I found in the box  it might turn<br/>
out to be too much of a hassle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing can be a damned misery.  Thanks for understanding,<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbNA] Has This Ever Happened to You?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was up in Maine planting a box over the weekend (I even listed <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; online, as it is rather celebratory and elegiac and I wanted it <br/>
to be<br/>
&gt; egalitarian.) I found some nice stamps at the area lighthouses -<br/>
&gt; easy boxes right off of the parking lot (Pemaquid even has a <br/>
restaurant,<br/>
&gt; gift shop, and a soda machine!) Moreover, these clues were clear <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; easy to follow, not so for these other clues!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My dilemma is this: I do not know if it is against the "rules"<br/>
&gt; to reveal too much of the clue here, but I need to complain, and <br/>
see if<br/>
&gt; anyone else feels the same. Anyway, I stopped in on another (WOM) <br/>
box<br/>
&gt; in Lincoln County and had a rough time of it. To start, it was <br/>
very hot<br/>
&gt; and muggy, and the skeeters were horrible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I had to find the place first, which happens to be on the <br/>
Damariscotta<br/>
&gt; River, where it is more ocean than river. I had to park by a <br/>
modest<br/>
&gt; sign along the road and walk down someone's driveway (the name<br/>
&gt; `Richardson' was on the white gate.) It was near 1:29 when I<br/>
&gt; finally found it! What at first looked like a trail marker was <br/>
just a<br/>
&gt; Nature Conservancy boundary marker, and I had to continue further <br/>
up the<br/>
&gt; drive to find an orange-blazed trail. Not mentioned in the clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I knew I was looking for a white blazed trail, and one bisects the<br/>
&gt; orange loop. Again, I had to walk the whole thing to discover <br/>
that I<br/>
&gt; needed to find one of the two white spurs that come off the <br/>
orange trail<br/>
&gt; along the water. Part of the trail near the water runs along some<br/>
&gt; steep, rocky terrain - I'm glad I didn't have to push a<br/>
&gt; stroller through here! Again, a mention of this in the clues <br/>
would have<br/>
&gt; been helpful, or I would not have worn flip-flops. I needed to <br/>
find a<br/>
&gt; lone spruce growing on a Point at trails end, then walk back 16 <br/>
paces to<br/>
&gt; find the box between two stones. There are many spruces, and the <br/>
stones<br/>
&gt; were not obvious; they were not even on the trail! In addition, <br/>
there<br/>
&gt; was no mention if a pace was one step or two. A note to visit <br/>
during<br/>
&gt; high tide should have been included. There were some pretty, <br/>
hidden<br/>
&gt; coves along the trail that would have looked like colored gems if <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; water were higher.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many local boxes are much easier than this one, and have much <br/>
better<br/>
&gt; directions. Maybe that's why the clue wasn't posted online. (I<br/>
&gt; even had to Google "Bawds of Euphony" to learn what the name<br/>
&gt; meant, and that the image of mermaids singing can be a metaphor <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; foolish fantasy and the unobtainable.) I don't even know if I<br/>
&gt; should continue on with what else I found in the box - it might <br/>
turn<br/>
&gt; out to be too much of a hassle.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing can be a damned misery. Thanks for understanding,<br/>

&gt; &gt; I was up in Maine planting a box over the weekend (I even listed <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; online, as it is rather celebratory and elegiac and I wanted it <br/>
to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; egalitarian.)  I found some nice stamps at the area lighthouses <br/>
&gt; &gt; easy boxes right off of the parking lot (Pemaquid even has a <br/>
restaurant,<br/>
&gt; &gt; gift shop, and a soda machine!)  Moreover, these clues were clear <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; easy to follow, not so for these other clues!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My dilemma is this: I do not know if it is against the "rules"<br/>
&gt; &gt; to reveal too much of the clue here, but I need to complain, and <br/>
see if<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone else feels the same.  Anyway, I stopped in on another <br/>
(WOM) box<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Lincoln County and had a rough time of it.  To start, it was <br/>
very hot<br/>
&gt; &gt; and muggy, and the skeeters were horrible.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I had to find the place first, which happens to be on the <br/>
Damariscotta<br/>
&gt; &gt; River, where it is more ocean than river.  I had to park by a <br/>
modest<br/>
&gt; &gt; sign along the road and walk down someone's driveway (the name<br/>
&gt; &gt; `Richardson' was on the white gate.)  It was near 1:29 when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally found it!  What at first looked like a trail marker was <br/>
just a<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nature Conservancy boundary marker, and I had to continue further <br/>
up the<br/>
&gt; &gt; drive to find an orange-blazed trail.  Not mentioned in the clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I knew I was looking for a white blazed trail, and one bisects the<br/>
&gt; &gt; orange loop.  Again, I had to walk the whole thing to discover <br/>
that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; needed to find one of the two white spurs that come off the <br/>
orange trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; along the water.  Part of the trail near the water runs along some<br/>
&gt; &gt; steep, rocky terrain  I'm glad I didn't have to push a<br/>
&gt; &gt; stroller through here!  Again, a mention of this in the clues <br/>
would have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been helpful, or I would not have worn flip-flops.  I needed to <br/>
find a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lone spruce growing on a Point at trails end, then walk back 16 <br/>
paces to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find the box between two stones.  There are many spruces, and the <br/>
stones<br/>
&gt; &gt; were not obvious; they were not even on the trail!  In addition, <br/>
there<br/>
&gt; &gt; was no mention if a pace was one step or two.  A note to visit <br/>
during<br/>
&gt; &gt; high tide should have been included.  There were some pretty, <br/>
hidden<br/>
&gt; &gt; coves along the trail that would have looked like colored gems if <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; water were higher.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Many local boxes are much easier than this one, and have much <br/>
better<br/>
&gt; &gt; directions.  Maybe that's why the clue wasn't posted online.  (I<br/>
&gt; &gt; even had to Google "Bawds of Euphony" to learn what the name<br/>
&gt; &gt; meant, and that the image of mermaids singing can be a metaphor <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; foolish fantasy and the unobtainable.)  I don't even know if I<br/>
&gt; &gt; should continue on with what else I found in the box  it might <br/>
turn<br/>
&gt; &gt; out to be too much of a hassle.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing can be a damned misery.  Thanks for understanding,<br/>
