This is not particularly a mystery letterbox but then again  Call it <br/>
a small mystery.  As always, please do not root around cluelessly in <br/>
the underbrush disturbing the flora and fauna.  When you figure it <br/>
out it will be pretty obvious.  Please be discrete as this is out in <br/>
the open somewhat and replace it carefully with its black camoflage <br/>
cover.<br/>

        "Easy fella.  Now what's happening at the bridge?  Could they <br/>
have heard about my troubles in Washington already?"  <br/>
	Harrison Raines slowed his horse and looked ahead at the <br/>
soldiers guarding the bridge to Virginia.  <br/>
	Son of a southern plantation owner, now Washington resident, <br/>
horse trader and sometime reluctant spy for the Union, Harry was <br/>
fleeing the city once again followed by the suspicions and <br/>
misunderstandings of lower level Washington authorities.  Pinkerton <br/>
and Lincoln himself had recruited Harry to work for the Union cause, <br/>
and the suspicions of local Union authorities only made Harry even <br/>
more useful for secret enquiry's in the South.  Unfortunately, it was <br/>
often very inconvenient.<br/>
	"Halt!"<br/>
	Earlier that morning across the river and high on the hill at <br/>
Fort Marcy there was no traffic in sight, "Men, this morning we will <br/>
conduct some range tests on the bridge down there.  If we're to <br/>
defend the Capital, we have to be ready to shoot rapidly and <br/>
accurately.  Damn the quartermasters for not supplying enough powder <br/>
and shot for drills but I'll pay for it myself if I have to.  Ready <br/>
your cannon to fire alongside the bridge and be sure you don't hit it <br/>
this time.  Sargent, send word to the sentries to halt any traffic <br/>
until we give the all clear signal."  <br/>
"Yes Sir."<br/>
	Harry sauntered his horse up to the sentry post trying to <br/>
look as nonchalant as he didn't feel.  <br/>
	Boom!<br/>
	"Heeyah!" <br/>
The horse bolted.<br/>
 	"Hey, stop!  Wait."  <br/>
Harry used the excuse to charge past the sentries and gallop onto the <br/>
bridge.  <br/>
	Boom!  "Good Lord they're firing on us!"<br/>
	The artillery man's accuracy was misinterpreted as damn close <br/>
near misses.<br/>
	"Cease firing!  What's that idiot doing down there!  Sargent <br/>
get down there and arrest that man!"<br/>
	"Bugler, sound arrest and detain", shouted the Sargent <br/>
running for his horse.  Instantly the bugler sounded the company's <br/>
code followed by the practiced signal code.<br/>
	Harry didn't know the bugle code he heard as he galloped over <br/>
the Potomac below but they weren't firing cannon at him anymore and <br/>
that he liked.  He didn't like the look of the sentry's eyes nor <br/>
their fixed bayonets lowered in his direction.<br/>
	"Good morning gentlemen."<br/>
	"We ain' no genelmen and you ain' goin' nowhere neither `til <br/>
the Sargent comes."<br/>
	The Sargent led Harry up the hill escorted by two bored and <br/>
trigger happy looking sentries.<br/>
	After much suspicious interrogation, Fort Marcy's Commander <br/>
was surprised to find the bridge fool to be an apparent southern <br/>
gentleman albeit a little down on his luck.  "I am sorry we startled <br/>
your horse and were obliged to detain you, but tell me again what <br/>
brings a horse trader from Washington across the river?"<br/>
	"I moved my operations into town but I still own land and <br/>
horses northwest of here.  If I don't visit it I'm afraid of what <br/>
might become of it."<br/>
	"I believe you're who you say you are but only because I've <br/>
heard of a horse of yours in some relation to a questionable game of <br/>
cards," the Commander said with some amusement, "I don't suppose you <br/>
know anything about that?"    <br/>
"I try to sell my horses, not lose them."<br/>
"Well you don't look shifty enough or prosperous enough to be one of <br/>
those broken down horse dealers cheating the Union Army.  The Sargent <br/>
will see you on your way.  Be careful and stop next time."<br/>
	"Thank you Sir," thinking this must be the only time losing a <br/>
horse at cards saved his neck, Harry replied,  "I shall be."<br/>
	"Men, clean your cannon well.  We're done for the day."<br/>
