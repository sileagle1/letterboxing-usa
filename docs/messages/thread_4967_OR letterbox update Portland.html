Today, I packed up my binoculars, my new spotting scope and my carving <br/>
tools and headed to the west <br/>
side of Portland to revel in the return of the spring birds, take a <br/>
look at he Bald eagle nest at Jackson <br/>
Bottoms and check up on the resident letterboxes. <br/>
I had a pretty good idea that the Waterfowl box might not have fared <br/>
too well through the winter. My <br/>
first clue was when Ryan and Amanda A asked me, "did you mean for the <br/>
box to be underwater?" Sure <br/>
enough it had floated off to parts unknown. Over a great lunch at <br/>
Maggie's Cafe (very high on the <br/>
cool-o-meter) across from the University in downtown Hillsboro I carved <br/>
a replacement stamp. It's in <br/>
it's original spot and awaiting the next flood-of letterboxers <br/>
preferably. Get that stamp before winter! <br/>
I'm pleased to say that Windairen's Raptor box made it fine through the <br/>
winter. The only glitch there is <br/>
that a zealot with a chainsaw made the "duck" instruction in the clue <br/>
irrelevant. Quacking is still <br/>
optional.<br/>
The next stop was Jackson Bottoms and lo and behold there was an eagle <br/>
on the nest and a eagle <br/>
survey guy there watching it with me. He thinks that the eggs began <br/>
hatching today. If he's got it right, <br/>
then we should be able to see wobbly, fuzzy little raptorettes in about <br/>
ten days. Then, I headed off to <br/>
check on the letterbox there for Lillis. Sadly, it's definitely missing <br/>
in action. A pity, too, since it's one <br/>
of my favorite stamps in my book. There were hundreds of swallows there <br/>
arguing over the numerous <br/>
nestboxes, a flock of egrets in the grass and dozens of screeeeeing <br/>
kildeer. No letterbox but scads of <br/>
birds. Spring is definitely here! Funhog<br/>

Wish I would of read this before spending 4 hours at Jackson Bottom <br/>
today.  I knew where it was supposed to be but thought I had gotten <br/>
something wrong so looked and looked but came back empty.  I seem to <br/>
have a knack for looking for missing boxes!  I found Rood Bridge <br/>
though 1, 2, and, 3.  Thanks for giving me reassurance that it was <br/>
missing and not my miscalculation.  By the way if you find a <br/>
pedometer out there....Its mine.  We were doing handstands and lost <br/>
it.<br/>
