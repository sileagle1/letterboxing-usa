<br/>
Welcome. You have picked a good spot to live in the US if you like <br/>
letterboxing. The New London area is one of the spots with the <br/>
highest concentration of letterboxes. (All relative, of course - <br/>
still pretty measly compared with most places in Dartmoor, I would <br/>
guess. But take a look at southern New England on our map site at<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
and you'll find several dozen boxes right close to home.<br/>
<br/>
You'll also see that there are three on Long Island.<br/>
<br/>
The site also contains pages on getting started.<br/>
<br/>

Some of us are accomplished stamp carvers. Others, like me, are <br/>
hopeless left-brain types who got into it for the puzzle-solving <br/>
treasure-hunting nature of the sport. All of us probably love <br/>
tramping around. But even if you're not artistically gifted, give the <br/>
stamp carving a try. It can grow on you. There are a lot of people <br/>
who can give you advice on carving and carving materials on this <br/>
list. I'm sure you'll hear from some of them.<br/>
<br/>
I've had two stamps made for me by Dan &amp; Dee and have been very happy <br/>
with them!<br/>

<br/>
And when you place your first boxes in Connecticut or Long Island, <br/>
let me know and we can talk about the best way of posting your clues <br/>
with Letterboxing North America. I manage the clue maps for New <br/>
England and New York.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a  week-end gathering for letterboxers planned for the <br/>
weekend of November 5 -7 in Killington, Vermont, at the Inn at Long <br/>
Trail. Would this interest you?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings from Connecticut!<br/>
     Until today I thought Letterboxing was only done in England !<br/>
     There were several articles in the Norwich Bulletin on letter<br/>
boxing,<br/>
I had company when I saw them and had to explain why I was jumping up<br/>
and <br/>
down to my friends, who have all decided to go letterboxing with me !<br/>
Does anyone know of any we could hunt down close by?  Also having never<br/>
quite down this before (we did something similar in college but not<br/>
with rubber stamps!)Does anyone know of a good place to get stamps<br/>
made?(i'm definately not an artist!)<br/>
   We plan on planting boxes in the New london area of Conn. and<br/>
Suffolk <br/>
county, Long Island. Any hints on planting would be helpful. Are there<br/>
any known to be already on the Island?<br/>
   Well I'm looking forward to next weekend when hopefully we'll start<br/>
our first Trip.<br/>
              hope everyone has fun!<br/>
                      Lethe<br/>
ps. The Hurricane was wimpy thankully !<br/>
