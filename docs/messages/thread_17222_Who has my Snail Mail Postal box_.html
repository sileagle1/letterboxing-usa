Yes it is me who has it!<br/>
<br/>
We got it, and I will be sending it out Monday or<br/>
Tuesday.  I had planned to send it along a couple of<br/>
weeks ago as soon as my kids both finished their new<br/>
stamps, when our house was struck by this absolutely<br/>
awful flu bug!  It's had us on our knees for awhile,<br/>
and in fact, this is the first day in at least 10<br/>
days, if not 2 weeks, that I've been online.  I highly<br/>
recommend the flu shot, if you can get one.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if you need to amend the list, send me the<br/>
info off-liist and I'll  get it done before it moves<br/>
along.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the delay - awesome box by the way!<br/>
