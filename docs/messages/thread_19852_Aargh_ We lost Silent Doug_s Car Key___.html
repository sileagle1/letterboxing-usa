While traveling from CA to ON, we were carrying Silent Doug's car <br/>
key - you know, the one he lost to his rental car at Don and Gwen's <br/>
in Kernville, Ca last fall? - and when we met some new letterboxers <br/>
from Moab, UT we took it out to show them our exalted treasure! <br/>
<br/>
However, when we got to our next stop in Denver, it was GONE!!!<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, someone wil come accross this little beauty and continue <br/>
its journey back to PA!<br/>
