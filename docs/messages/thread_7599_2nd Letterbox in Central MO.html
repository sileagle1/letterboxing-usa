     I've been aware of letterboxing for some time, thanks to my <br/>
sisters in Mass.  Finally hid my first box on Sunday, also have <br/>
visited the Bat Cave box in Columbia - very cool!  Here's my info.<br/>
THREE CREEKS LETTERBOX<br/>
Planted by Jenny J<br/>
September 8, 2002<br/>
County:  Boone<br/>
A pace = approx. 22"<br/>
Trail Notes:You will need to be moderately adventurous to enjoy this <br/>
hunt.  Three Creeks Conservation Area is a state forest, not very <br/>
developed, no water, no latrines.  The trails are merely worn paths. <br/>
Maps are available from Mo. Dept. of Conservation, District Office, <br/>
1907 Hillcrest Drive, Columbia, MO 65201.  As in most wild areas, <br/>
poison ivy is common.  Insect spray in the summer is highly <br/>
recommended.  Terrain is rocky in some areas, but not difficult.  I <br/>
like to use a walking stick when hiking here.  Wear sensible shoes.  <br/>
The creek is frequently bone-dry or very shallow.  After a rainy <br/>
spell, there may be several inches of water.  Best not to hike the <br/>
area in periods of heavy rains or flash flooding.<br/>
     Good Luck!<br/>
     From Kansas City or St. Louis, take I-70 to Columbia.  Go south <br/>
on Hwy. 63 for 7.5 miles.  Turn right (west) onto Deer Park Road.  <br/>
(Turning left will put you on AB.)  Drive 2.5 miles on Deer Park Rd. <br/>
to the Three Creeks C.A. parking lot.<br/>
     Enter the trail at the iron gate next to the Cedar Creek Club <br/>
sign.  Hike along the grassy path, first tree-lined, then opening <br/>
into a meadow for approx. 1/4 mile.<br/>
     There is a fork in the path with a yellow sign prohibiting <br/>
horseback riding.  Take the left fork, heading south.<br/>
     After about 110 paces, if you look carefully, you will see that <br/>
you are crossing an old fence line, only rough-hewn posts remain.  <br/>
Here is the forest.<br/>
     Go 70 paces to another fork in a small clearing.  Choose the <br/>
left fork, still heading south/east.<br/>
     32 paces will bring you to a spreading oak tree on your left.  <br/>
The path is still grassy.<br/>
     Another 56 paces, another large oak tree on your left.  You will <br/>
shortly begin your descent to the creekbed.<br/>
     The path will become a bit rocky.  You can see Turkey Creek <br/>
below to your left.  After a longer walk, about 270 paces, there will <br/>
be a clearing with a rocky campfire site on your right.<br/>
     95 paces bring you to another fork in the trail. Go left.<br/>
     150 paces farther is a second campfire site in the midst of <br/>
several downed trees on your right.  Your descent continues and the <br/>
path begins to wind to the north.<br/>
     The creek is at your right.  At 70 paces you will find an old <br/>
trail marker "8".  Perhaps you'll hear or see a pileated woodpecker <br/>
in this area.<br/>
     70 more paces will take you to the edge of the woods with the <br/>
creek on your right.<br/>
     Follow the path along the edge of the creek.  Quite soon you <br/>
will see a large rocky outcropping on your left and a huge, fallen-<br/>
away boulder.<br/>
     Pass between the outcropping and the boulder. Stand with the <br/>
boulder at your right shoulder and face the creek.  Look towards"10 <br/>
o'clock" across the creek.  This is where the trail resumes, at the <br/>
bend in the creek.<br/>
     After crossing the creek, take 14 paces along the path.  The <br/>
creek is on your left now.<br/>
     Look right for a tree with a forked trunk, about 7 paces off the <br/>
trail.  There is a hollow at the base of the tree and an animal's <br/>
hole in the smaller fork of the trunk.  In the hollow at the base is <br/>
a large, flat, white creek rock.  Poke into the hollow with a stick <br/>
first, then lift the rock.  You've found the letterbox!<br/>
     You can finish the trail loop for about a 2.5 mile hike or <br/>
return the way you came, about 1.5 miles.<br/>
