Howdy, y'all!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's a whole lot of carvin' going on down here in the great state of<br/>
Texas - we're getting ready for the second annual gathering: The Texas<br/>
Letterbox Rodeo event, organized by Silver Eagle and to be held at Brazos<br/>
Bend State Park on March 19th!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to inspiration from wonderful Scarab of The Doubtful Guests, we are<br/>
creating a Wild, Wild West -themed CLUE game, complete with spine-tingling<br/>
locations such as the Saloon, the Jail and the Pullman Car; Weapons as<br/>
lethal as a tomahawk, rattlesnake and a wagon wheel chandelier; and<br/>
dastardly Suspects including Sheriff Mustard, Schoolmaster Plum and Madam<br/>
Meadowbrook the Dance Hall owner!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After our own Texas event, we're planning to offer to loan the set of Wild<br/>
West CLUE stamps to other gatherings around the country, with the request<br/>
that you add at least one new stamp to the collection! Any questions or<br/>
requests should be directed to celticlions at comcast dot net.<br/>

( Okay, back to trying to carve Miss Scarlett, the Wealthy Rancher's<br/>
daughter.!)<br/>
