<br/>
Anyone in the eastern Ct. area check out the Parent Planner newspaper <br/>
for a letterboxing article and quotes from me. It is a paper of <br/>
things to do with kids and they interviewed me several months back. <br/>
They even included clues to a first box the Queen of hearts, so we <br/>
will see even more local growth I hope.  I plan to send a copy to the <br/>
Drews maybe we can get it on the site. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Bird house Lady and the 2 fat Cats glad to see you  got <br/>
your first boxes. many great ones to come.   Have a great day all. <br/>

Just wanted to introduce myself. My kids and I found some references to <br/>
this on different Scout websites, and thought it sounded like fun. <br/>
We've just carved our first stamp, and we'll be getting our other <br/>
necessities together soon. My son's excited about earning his <br/>
Orienteering merit badge, and we've found a geocaching badge for my <br/>
daughter, too, though we'll have to borrow a gps for that, lol. Are <br/>
there any letterboxes in the WKY area we can get started with?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

If I'm not mistaken (I'm a Cub Scouter, not a Girl Scouter), the Girl Scout<br/>
badge is actually called Hi Tech Hide and Seek, and it covers both<br/>
letterboxing and geocaching.  Maybe you won't have to borrow a GPS after<br/>
all, or maybe you can, and then she can use both for her badge?<br/>
