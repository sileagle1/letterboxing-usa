Difficulty: easy<br/>
Terrain: moderate (It's a hilly cemetery.)<br/>
<br/>
You'll find this mighty steed resting peacefully in Fairmont Cemetery <br/>
in Jackson, Ohio.  To get there, take the Broadway exit off US Route <br/>
#35 and turn west, toward town.  You'll find the entrance road on <br/>
your right about  mile from the exit.  Follow the entrance road into <br/>
the cemetery straight up the hill to the top of the ridge.  Turn left <br/>
onto the road that follows the crest of the ridge and drive until you <br/>
reach a large maple tree very close to the road on your right.  About <br/>
36 paces down the road past this tree (1 pace = 2 steps but the <br/>
terrain and need to be respectful of the graves makes the distance <br/>
approximate here) you should find 6 large, ornate, identical stones <br/>
side by side.  From the south side of the southern-most stone, take a <br/>
bearing of 260 and go about 18 paces to an ancient cedar tree.  From <br/>
the cedar tree, take a bearing of 225 and go about 27 paces to a <br/>
gnarled old maple tree with a big hollow in its side.  Way down in <br/>
this hollow, under some discarded artificial flowers (and prickly <br/>
thorns!) you'll find our old horse quietly slumbering.<br/>
<br/>
