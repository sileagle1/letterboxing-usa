hunting ( animals not boxes ). Some of the messages I have read give me the 
impression that venturing into the woods  is a fairly new activity for some 
of the letterboxers so I felt that some cautionary advice is in order. Hunting 
season in most states start with Dove season Sept 1, Quail season starts shortly 
thereafter as does Deer and Turkey seasons.When going on your letterboxing 
forays wear bright neon orange and put some neon orange on your dogs. I always 
have a bell on my Britanie when we are hunting and its not to chase the Bears 
off, it is so I know where she is at all times.Just remember there are some 
folks in the woods that could be as new to hunting animals as some of our folks 
hunting boxes. Box on !

I know some 'hunters' that I wouldn't want to be in the same state <br/>
when they are hunting much less the same forest area.<br/>
I like to think this type of hunter is not the norm, but it only <br/>
takes one, with you in the right place at the wrong time.<br/>

I have been in the woods on both occassions of hunting<br/>
animals and letterboxing, and I happen to understand<br/>
the regulations for Hunter Safety for both Firearms<br/>
and Archery for the State of Connecticut. <br/>
If you can't put off your letterbox hike consider<br/>
adding a BLAZE ORANGE hat or vest (200 cu. in. is the<br/>
minimum required in the state of Connecticut, to your<br/>
Letterboxing Kit, on or about... even better 2 weeks<br/>
before... Sept 1.<br/>
Better to play it safe than sorry.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">With hunting season just around the corner, perhaps it's time to plan <br/>
ahead. Choose to hunt boxes during hunting season that are placed in <br/>
areas owned by maybe the Audobon Society or other Land Trust groups <br/>
where hunting isn't allowed. Two areas in RI that come to mind are <br/>
Fisherville Brook and the Parker Woodlands. Also, some state and town <br/>
owned parks aren't open to hunting, but offer hiking and <br/>
letterboxing, for example, Goddard Park, again in RI. Last year <br/>
during hunting season I visited nearby Ct. on Sundays, where hunting <br/>
isn't allowed on that day of the week, but shooting ranges are open. <br/>
Also, look for clue sheets where the box is hidden just off a road, <br/>
or maybe less than a half mile into the woods. Most hunters I've <br/>
talked to around the Arcadia area of RI say they are deep in the <br/>
woods and traffic from hikers and boxers helps drive the game towards <br/>
them. Another option would be the shoreline boxes. I know this <br/>
doesn't help those that live outside the RI/Ct. area, but if we have <br/>
the area's for safe fall/winter boxing here, there could be many <br/>
boxes in your area, too.  Here's another idea, if there are no boxes <br/>
in your area placed in lands not open to hunting, then use hunting <br/>
season to place some. No need to sit at home. Plan ahead and go do <br/>
what you love without fear. <br/>
Seeya on the trails, we'll all be wearing that fashionable bright <br/>
orange.<br/>
