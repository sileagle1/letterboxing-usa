&gt; That would mean I'd have to meet you at some O Race (I wouldn't, so don't <br/>
&gt; worry) or you are just going to have to come to the East Coast Gathering <br/>
&gt; in Richmond on September 28. I'm sure I'm not the only one who would like <br/>
&gt; to meet you. <br/>
<br/>
Not an O race, only at a letterboxing related thing.  And I can't make it to<br/>
that gathering, so it will be some other time ...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;    Back to your Mystery Boxes. You have a 2 star on the Eastern Shore<br/>
&gt; Treasure Map. It was planted Feb. 1999. Is it still available to<br/>
&gt; find, <br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure.  It hasn't been reported missing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Or, that's the chance you take when it comes to treasure hunting! <br/>
<br/>
That is so my attitude.  But a very minority one, I imagine ...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
