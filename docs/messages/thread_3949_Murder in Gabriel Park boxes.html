out into the rain (brilliant?) and spent a couple of hours searching for<br/>
evidence and interviewing witnesses. The good news is that we succeeded<br/>
in finding all the evidence (six boxes) needed to convict the<br/>
perpetrator. The bad news is that one of us recently spent time in the<br/>
company of Joe, the murderer, having picked him up as a hitch hiker.<br/>
Fortunately, no one was hurt but he made his escape and is again on the<br/>
loose. All letterboxers should be on the lookout for this dastardly<br/>
villain. Funhog<br/>
