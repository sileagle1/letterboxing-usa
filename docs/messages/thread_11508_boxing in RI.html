                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm so happy to finally have a report for y'all.  On Monday, I <br/>
visited Moonstone Baby's "The Dog Days of Summer" at the Great Swamp. <br/>
I had a great time.  This series was lots of fun.  The day was <br/>
glorious; lots of activity on the impoundment, barely any mud, really <br/>
cute stamps. I can't wait to meet Katie, Indy and Skye in person.  <br/>
Thanks to Janet.<br/>
On Saturday, I headed to Rocky Neck and had a wonderful time there as <br/>
well.  As luck would have it, I ran into the illustruous Butterfly on <br/>
my travels and had a petie tour of her neighborhood State Park. Lots <br/>
of reasons to go back.<br/>
Last Friday, I planted a box "Strong to the Finish" on the banks of <br/>
the Blackstone River.  Clues will be up shortly.<br/>
It feels good to be outside again. <br/>
<br/>
Refreshingly,<br/>
