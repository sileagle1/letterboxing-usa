&gt; Ryan, I'm locked out of AtlasQuest<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about that.  =(  My hosting service unexpectedly upgraded the<br/>
database version they use, and it uses a different encryption<br/>
algorithm than the old one did, so the passwords are no longer<br/>
matching properly.<br/>
<br/>
I've fixed the problem now.  However.....  The old passwords can't be<br/>
re-created since they were only stored in their encrypted state--which<br/>
cannot be unencyrpted.  If you use the Lost Password Center at<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/login/retrieve.html you can get a new<br/>
password sent to you (and it'll actually work this time!)  Then you<br/>
can reset your password to whatever you want.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the glitch!  On the plus side, however, the new enycrption<br/>
algorithm is much more secure and difficult to hack into.  =)<br/>
