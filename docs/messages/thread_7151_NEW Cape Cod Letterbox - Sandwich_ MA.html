Directions: Located on Cape Cod, Mass.  Go over the Bourne Bridge and <br/>
get on route 6A from the rotary after immediately getting off the <br/>
bridge. The Green Briar Nature Center is located off of Rt. 6A just <br/>
West of the Town of Sandwich, on Discovery Hill Road. Parking is <br/>
available shortly after you turn onto Discovery Hill Rd. or a little <br/>
further at the Nature Center and Jam Kitchen itself.<br/>
<br/>
The Thorton W. Burgess Society sponsors the Green Briar Nature <br/>
Center.  Thorton W. Burgess was the author of Peter Rabbit and an <br/>
avid conservationist.  The Nature Center also has a Jam Kitchen.  Be <br/>
sure to check out their wonderful products. Every summer vacation <br/>
means loading up on their jams before returning home to Connecticut.  <br/>
The Nature Center has about 2 miles of trails. Your starting point is <br/>
the parking lot at the Jam Kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
To find Peter Rabbit<br/>
You must be his match<br/>
Find the start of the trial<br/>
Called Briar Patch.<br/>
<br/>
Past Locust ridge trial<br/>
Don't turn just yet<br/>
Continue along the path<br/>
This is your best bet.<br/>
<br/>
Across road you must go<br/>
Past the Waterman's entrance<br/>
Along and above<br/>
Continue your trial dance.<br/>
<br/>
Not steep trial you go,<br/>
But forward to junction;<br/>
Left is best for now,<br/>
And then down is your function.<br/>
<br/>
Into the woods to find Peter,<br/>
And at the next decision;<br/>
Continue straight as a leader,<br/>
Looking for Discovery direction.<br/>
<br/>
Left and then right,<br/>
onto the loop,<br/>
Red pipe confirms your course;<br/>
As up goes the slope.<br/>
<br/>
Upon reaching Pine grove<br/>
And finding benches two,<br/>
Stand between them your best<br/>
Then Northeast you do.<br/>
<br/>
Path turns to your left<br/>
and at right turn stop<br/>
At Tree with two trunks<br/>
Too far and you are stuck.<br/>
<br/>
First prize waits in a tree with trunks four,<br/>
Westerly you dance for 5 paces times two,<br/>
Look to the base and not much more to do,<br/>
Under leaves is buried your due.<br/>
<br/>
To find your next prize <br/>
back to path you must go,<br/>
Continue along Discovery trail<br/>
Until a junction with Peter Cottontail<br/>
<br/>
Briar Patch Trail you have returned, <br/>
look to the West and see Stone Junction<br/>
where trail crosses stones<br/>
this is you next function.<br/>
<br/>
As you walk along pathway<br/>
You find Five tree stand<br/>
This is where your<br/>
next prize will land.<br/>
<br/>
Three Hundred and Thirty is the direction of choice<br/>
Where you will see stone wall before moist<br/>
Under rocks in the wall is the last of the boxes<br/>
And celebrate your find with joyous voices.<br/>
<br/>
To get home, you can go back the way you came,<br/>
Or continue as before to the road to which you came.<br/>
It's not far a walk to return to the kitchen<br/>
Hope the hunt was successful and you completed your mission.<br/>
