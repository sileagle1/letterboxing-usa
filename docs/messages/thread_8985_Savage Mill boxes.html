                    <html><body>Ok, "My bad" as they say.<br/>
<br/>
The good news is...  Both boxes are still there and in happy condition.<br/>
Bad news is that I have the WRONG compass bearing in my clues.  I will email the webmaster and make the change.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who might need to know right now...<br/>
<br/>
For the Truss Box  The clues should read...  Take a 120 degree bearing, NOT a 20 degree bearing.  I apparantly cannot read my hastily scrawled clues.<br/>
<br/>
My deepest apologies to the Usual Suspects.  It seems that every time I mess up my clues, they are the ones that suffer.  sorry, so sorry!<br/>
<br/>
Also many thanks to DandShoo who were kind enough to point out my error.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the Usual Suspects atleast enjoyed the walk - it's really pretty there, isn't it?  I hope you guys will try again!<br/>
