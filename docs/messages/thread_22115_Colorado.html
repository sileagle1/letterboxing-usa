<br/>
Grabbing a breakfast burrito and Mayan Mocha at Java Joe's, I hit the interstate, north to Delta, Colorado.<br/>
<br/>
Delta is a river valley town, the county seat, and largest community in Delta County. Which really isn't saying much. The real claim to fame, in my view, is the Delta Uncompahgre Blues Festival. With notables such as Teresa James and the Rhythm Tramps, The Johnny O. Band, the North Fork Flyers, and the Santa of the blues, George Whitesell, it was all it promised to be. Soulful music at its best. <br/>
<br/>
Holing up in my VW Microbus at the Valley Sunset RV Ranch, I spent some serious time preparing my lecture for an upcoming conference in Glenwood Springs. The PPIA, that would be The Professional Private Investigator's Association, requested that I share my difficulties on solving crimes across state lines. Having recently solved the "Missing Store of Good Manners" case, and before that the "PZ Kut Caper," I knew first hand how difficult co-operation across state lines can be. Speaking of difficulties, Enigma Stealthboxxer, P.I., the ALPI, that would be the Association of Letterboxing Private Investigators, has voted down your request that I be banned from the group. Furthermore you will be receiving a notice that your annual dues will be withheld for lack of courtesy towards another investigator. <br/>
<br/>
The conference behind me I now set off to fulfill a more pleasant obligation; judging the Bohemian Style Pilsener at the Great American Beer Festival in Denver. Three days of excellent beer, what more could one ask for? For the beer lovers out there, Gordon Biersch Czech Lager out of Chattanooga Tennessee is by far the best Bohemian Style. But, I did not come here to talk about the blues, conferences or beer; I came to talk letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
The Front Range definitely has the corner on letterboxing in Colorado. The eastern section is lacking. Sturdy containers and sealing ziplocks are a must in this extreme weather state. Hiking in Colorado has its unique challenges. The lowest point is 3,315 feet above sea level. Now, what this means is thin air. Thin air, to some, would mean difficulties breathing. Know your limits. Although abandoned mines might seem interesting, avoid them. They are dangerous. The black bear and cougars share your trails; know what to expect and how to protect yourself. Colorado, right now there is almost 700 letterboxes, why are there only 42 mysteries listed? Hard to think in the thin air?<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>
