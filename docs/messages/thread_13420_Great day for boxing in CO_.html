                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today, Eric and I hiked up the Dakota Ridge Trail in search of <br/>
Funhog's "Rain Cloud Box".  What a beautiful trail!  It's rocky, with <br/>
some good inclines, but we encountered lots of serious mountain <br/>
bikers making a day of it, too.  Great views all around.  <br/>
<br/>
We missed the box on the first pass, and found ourselves at another <br/>
great place for a plant!  So, we sat down, carved a stamp, and made <br/>
this a two-box trail!  Clues for this box will be up in a day or so.  <br/>
On the way back, we resigned ourselves to the fact that we'd just <br/>
come back on another day and try for the Rain Cloud again, but we <br/>
found the landmark we'd missed earlier, and were rewarded with the <br/>
box!<br/>
<br/>
Eric also came up with a great idea for a hitchhiker, so that will be <br/>
coming soon to a box near you!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Autumn<br/>
