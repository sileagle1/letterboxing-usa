Northwest....ahh what a place.  We went sightseeing, hiked &amp; went <br/>
letterboxing for 8 days.  Needless to say being from flat Florida <br/>
those hills just about killed me!  But none the less I had the best <br/>
time.  Now that I am back in Tampa I want to continue.  But there <br/>
are so few letterboxes here :(  So I am sending out a challenge to <br/>
all of those who live here or are visiting.  Get up, get out, &amp; move <br/>
your butts!  I am committing to placeing 10 letterboxes in the next <br/>
30 days!  How about that.  I am also interested in getting together <br/>
for a Florida swap!  I know you guys are out there, ok so its hot &amp; <br/>
it rains a little but our state has year round activities so there <br/>
is no reason not we can't compete with the rainy Northwest!  Please <br/>
take this as a friendly challenge &amp; let me know what you all think :)<br/>

I have 3 boxes near Sarasota.  Even though there are not many local <br/>
letterboxers (yet) lots of people visit FL.  When I last visited and <br/>
checked I was surprised to see the stamps of two people I knew from <br/>
the NE.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to a serious Tampa boxing trip.<br/>
