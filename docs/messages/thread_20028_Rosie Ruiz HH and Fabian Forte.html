of America. She's been lingering on the West Coast  for way too long and much <br/>
appreciates this leg up in the race. Last Tuesday, while talking to one of my <br/>
customers in Iowa, I learned that the Iowa State Fair was in full swing. Not only is this <br/>
a state that has more hogs than humans, a perfect situation for a Funhog, but the <br/>
Saturday night entertainment at the fair offered a once in a lifetime opportunity: a <br/>
concert that included Fabian! How could I miss that???<br/>
<br/>
I'd been saving up frequent flyer miles for a trip to Dartmoor but, hey, this was <br/>
irresistible! I called the airline, found out that all the freebie seats to Des Moines were <br/>
gone (go figure!) but I could get to Omaha. It's not a bad drive from there to Des <br/>
Moines. Plus, I'd recently received reports that my Mandan Heron letterbox in Omaha <br/>
might be missing. I figured this was my opportunity to give it a check. After a lovely <br/>
lunch with the mysterious vegan, pigeon raising, Esperanto speaking letterboxer, <br/>
Scott Redd, I headed down to the river to check on the box. I'm pleased to say that <br/>
the box is just fine and I left Rosie enjoying riverview real estate. <br/>
<br/>
Now, on to the big excitement at the State Fair... this show featured Lou Christie,  <br/>
Freddy "Boom Boom" Cannon, Lesley Gore, Tommy Roe, the Marvelettes, Danny and <br/>
the Juniors plus my all-time fave, Fabian. Unbelieveably, I dropped my name as <br/>
"Funhog from TIME magazine" and they let me backstage! I got to meet all the oldies <br/>
but goodies on the bill AND, get this, tell them about letterboxing. Fabian was <br/>
particlularly interested when I told him about the Musicians Series by Brett Costley <br/>
and the Beatles boxes by Jay Drew and TeamGreenDragon. Everyone asked why there <br/>
were no boxes featuring any of them? OK letterboxers, time for some Golden Oldies <br/>
Letterboxes... Funhog<br/>
