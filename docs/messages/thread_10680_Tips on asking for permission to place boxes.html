                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here are my suggestions: <br/>
<br/>
1. Be sure to point out that most letterboxers are very into preserving the environment. <br/>
<br/>
2. Offer to keep your boxes as close to the trail as possible. <br/>
<br/>
3. Ask if you may have permission to plant 1 or 2 boxes, and see how it goes before placing more. Be very clear about how you are more than willing to work with them to develop a policy or protocol for hiding boxes. <br/>
<br/>
4. When you do finally plant boxes, make sure that your clues indicate the rules you have agreed to -- so if the boxes are supposed to be near the trail, say that in your clues so that people know that if they can't find it right near the trail, they should not wander off the trail to look.  <br/>
<br/>
5. Some places consider letterboxes as "litter" and it is very helpful to point out that you plan to return to the boxes to check on their condition, replace any missing contents, etc. If it is possible, you might let them know you plan to check on the boxes every week, month, 3 months or whatever is possible for you. <br/>
<br/>
6. Offer to relocate boxes if, at any time, they are creating wear and tear on the environment.  <br/>
