<br/>
although it would be very cool to look for boxes (and caches) in a <br/>
national park, the NPS serves as kind of our "historians" and take <br/>
care of lots of places other than large forested systems (like <br/>
Yosimite).  they are charged with preserving our history and <br/>
heritage, and (my opinion here) placing a box or cache in the area <br/>
that they are supposed to be preserving would not fit their <br/>
purpose...i mean, Licoln didn't place a letterbox in his old <br/>
neighborhood (i.e., Lincoln Historical Site in Springfield, IL), so <br/>
it shouldn't be there...understand?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I know you are frustrated and are just venting (and it is NOT my <br/>
intention to reopen this wound yet again on this list... so please forgive me), but <br/>
it is my perception that you believe they are prohibiting letterboxing just to <br/>
p*ss you off. Which obviously they are not. <br/>
<br/>
There are many public lands and private institutions that have embraced <br/>
letterboxing and questing, much to their credit, but a large part of that <br/>
participation is a management strategy on their part. If they are part of the <br/>
"program", so to speak, they will be more in the loop and able to have an open dialogue <br/>
with 'boxers as to how and where boxes are placed.<br/>
<br/>
As someone who has worked for (and currently work for) private organizations <br/>
whose mission it is to preserve and conserve natural, historic and <br/>
aethetically important places, I must emphasize what a difficult balancing act it is to <br/>
have a piece of land that you want people to visit and enjoy, but that you are <br/>
charged with maintaining it at a specific level of quality, health and <br/>
biodiversity. <br/>
<br/>
Think about it. What if your job was to manage a piece of land or historic <br/>
site? You notice that in one year your visitation has increased 3 fold, which is <br/>
great,  because it proves that you are getting the word out and people are <br/>
enjoying the place. But you also start to realize that there is not enough <br/>
parking and people have begun wearing out the grassy areas parking where they can <br/>
find space. You also realize that what used to be a quiet, quaint footpath is <br/>
now over 10 feet wide and the trees at the trail edge are dying of compacted <br/>
roots. What would YOU do?<br/>
<br/>
Most people who work in these jobs do it because they believe in what they <br/>
are doing. They are not lazy! (and I take deep offense at the statement). Most <br/>
people in this field have an awful lot on their plates, and often work very <br/>
long hours for very little pay, because they believe in it AND because it has to <br/>
be done.<br/>
<br/>
YOU try simultaneously being a teacher, scientist, grant writer/fundraiser, <br/>
engineer, marketing guru, publisher, ambassador for the public and office <br/>
manager working 50 - 60 hours a week for $19 - $25K a year.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that letterboxers have to present a united front in the public eye, <br/>
but we ALSO have to be the learned, open-minded, diplomatic and reasonable ones <br/>
- taking the 'high road' if we want to be taken seriously and be respected. <br/>
Otherwise we just end up looking like the 'geeks who hunt tupperware'.<br/>
<br/>
As an environmentalist, I know what I am talking about. We are always trying <br/>
to defend ourselves against the image of the radical, knee-jerk "tree <br/>
huggers". We do not want to gain that type of reputation as letterboxers. We would <br/>
have no credibility.<br/>
<br/>
Our "united front" must be friendly, understanding and intelligent to public <br/>
scrutiny. I would caution against reactionary behavior and not let our <br/>
emotions get away from us. Our emotions are very important, but we must remember that <br/>
passionately defaming someone else really doesn't make anyone want to be on <br/>
our side.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I'm done.<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
-Kim (Rustypuff)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt; Why  not letterbox on National Parks?  I am sure there is a very<br/>
&gt; good, obvious reason.  I am just curious as to what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Because it's in their little rule book, and an organization of that <br/>
size is run by rules up the Yazoo.<br/>
<br/>
But--and this is completely a theory on my part from observations <br/>
I've made--some parks I think are more forgiving of letterboxers than <br/>
others.  The official word is letterboxes are not permitted in <br/>
National Parks, but I think the folks that run some of the national <br/>
parks actually don't mind a few well-placed letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, most of the day-to-day running of the parks is done by <br/>
people that work in their park, and there really isn't much <br/>
communication between parks.  And it really depends on how hell-bent <br/>
the individuals working in a park are on how long a letterbox can <br/>
last there.  Some parks are very anti-letterboxing and allegedly <br/>
patrol this talk list for illegal letterboxing activities on their <br/>
land.<br/>
<br/>
But there are other national parks where the National Park was <br/>
informed about a letterbox, but then took absolutely no actions to do <br/>
anything about it.  Maybe they felt they had bigger concerns like <br/>
crowd control and teaching idiots not to feed to the animals.  Maybe <br/>
the administrators of those parks actually enjoy letterboxing.  <br/>
They'll never say that in an official capacity, of course, but I have <br/>
a strong suspicion that some national parks really are more forgiving <br/>
of letterboxers than others.<br/>
<br/>
A disclaimer, though: I'm not trying to convince anyone to go out and <br/>
hide boxes in any national parks.  Except for maybe Capitol Reef NP--<br/>
because I *really* don't like those park employees and would love to <br/>
upset their lazy lifestyles.  ;o)  Letterboxing in National Parks is <br/>
illegal.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I think the powers-that-be in national parks are <br/>
really shooting themselves in the foot with such an uncompromising <br/>
attitude.  They can outlaw letterboxes, but it's still going to <br/>
happen.  It'll just be happening behind their backs.  People will <br/>
hide boxes with no contact or identifying marks.  They'll start <br/>
passing clues around verbally instead of publicized on websites.  <br/>
They'll start planting 'fake' boxes to give the park service <br/>
imaginary boxes to confiscate.<br/>
<br/>
At least with a tone of reconciliation and compromise, they can keep <br/>
letterboxing above-ground where they can keep on eye on it and insure <br/>
the boxes being placed in acceptable areas.  It urks me to no end <br/>
when a NPS employees complains about a letterbox in one of their <br/>
parking lots.  Yeah, the letterbox is a problem, but building a damn <br/>
parking lot--NO PROBLEM.  *rolling eyes*<br/>

"You make what I'm doing illegal, I don't like that, so I'm going to do it anyway.  Your little rule book is wron, and I'm going to find others in your organization that agree with me and we're going to team up to circumvent your rules."<br/>
<br/>
NPS folks deal with tons (Tons - get that picture into your head) of litter every day.  We've seen poorly-maintained boxes and boxes abandoned by their planter - that is litter.  Numerous efforts to contact the placer have failed, but Diane and I haven't returned on those trips to get up there and yank the dang boxes yet.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, say you're a good, consciencious planter who always maintains the box regularly, and plant one in a natural area that isn't as tame as southern New England.  Yosemite critters know what food containers look like and what's inside.  They tear them into tiny pieces and scatter the guts looking for goodies.  Don't get me started on raccoons in a tug-of-war with a cook over who owns the trash bag, or five bears deciding that this field kitchen is now theirs.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have a lot of trouble with critters with my boxes, but then if they get busted up, it's not a park that gets trashed.  The rangers are acting responsibly, trying to be as good a steward of creation as they can given the volume of visitors (some not as respectful as the average letterboxer) they get.  Let's cut them a little slack, and try not to think of them as the monolithic menace.  I gotta figure they're not in it for the money, power or glory of public service forestry!<br/>

<br/>
Interesting.  I don't remember ever saying that I would continue to <br/>
hide letterboxes in a National Park.  Who gave you that idea?  Why <br/>
would I bother?  I'd rather hide a box in a legal location where it <br/>
can live a long and fun-filled life.<br/>
<br/>
But I am VERY pissed off about the park service's attitude as a whole <br/>
about letterboxing.  They haven't tried to work with letterboxers to <br/>
find a happy middle-ground that everyone can live with.  That's the <br/>
part that urks me most.  No consideration is given about where it <br/>
might be okay to letterbox.  Where it might be a useful to get <br/>
visitors to less-visited, less-impacted parks.  Or less-impacted <br/>
areas of the same park.<br/>
<br/>
The National Park Service doesn't always have a stellar record of <br/>
preserving the outdoors.  I want to sabatoge those stupid leaf-<br/>
blowers they have.  They take something that's completely natural, <br/>
feels wonderfully good under your feet, and find the single most <br/>
ecologicly unfriendly manner possible to get rid of them.  It's <br/>
disgraceful.<br/>
<br/>
The last time I was out at Channel Islands National Park, they had <br/>
cows roaming the island.  Yep, the meat in that hamburger you ate <br/>
could have come from a national park.  Disgraceful.<br/>
<br/>
Snowmobiles have been allowed in national parks for a long, long <br/>
time, although I remember some sort of controversy about Clinton <br/>
banning them from national parks.  I've never snowmobiled, though, so <br/>
I don't know many details on that.  I think Bush allowed limited <br/>
snowmobiling back.  (Surprise, surprise.)<br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of great people I've worked with in the NPS, and they <br/>
have done a great job in many respects, but the NPS treatment of <br/>
letterboxers is shameful.<br/>
<br/>
I'm done with hiding boxes in national parks--it's not worth the <br/>
effort--but I'm all for other people doing it.  Civil disobedience.  <br/>
God bless America.  It could make someone a criminal today, but a <br/>
martyr tomorrow.  Their draconian tactics with regards to <br/>
letterboxing is only going to drive the sport underground where they <br/>
can't control it quite so easily.  I'm just stating the obvious.<br/>
<br/>
If the national park service can find room for campers, backpackers, <br/>
fishermen, and hikers, I should think they could find room for a few <br/>
letterboxers.  Hand out lists of pre-approved places for <br/>
letterboxes.  Or hide boxes themselves that they can keep an eye on, <br/>
so letterboxers don't feel the 'need' to plant their own boxes in <br/>
less desireable places.  <br/>
<br/>
You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar, they say, but <br/>
the NPS has been stuffing us a lot of vinegar, and I don't like it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Let's cut them a little slack, and try not to think of them as the<br/>
&gt; monolithic menace.<br/>
<br/>
They ARE a monolithic menace.  I *have* worked in the National <br/>
Parks.  I've built some of those fences that keep visitors out of <br/>
sensitive areas.  I've built picnic tables for the visitors.  I've <br/>
revegitated hard-hit areas.  I've cleared trails.  Built turnpikes.  <br/>
Dug water drips.  I've pulled out several tons of asphault from <br/>
abandoned trails.  (Get this--the NPS didn't even know where one <br/>
trail went anymore--we had to uncover them first to find out!  And we <br/>
actually found one abandoned trail that the NPS didn't even know ever <br/>
existed!)  One of my favorite tasks was fixing an electric fence to <br/>
keeps cows out of a particularly sensitive area on the Channel <br/>
Islands where endangered birds nest.  Afterwards. we searched the <br/>
area for stray cows to herd them back to "their" side of the electric <br/>
fence.  Felt like a real cowboy with that experience.<br/>
<br/>
I've probably visited more national parks than the typical person <br/>
will in a lifetime.  Most of the individual NPS personel I've dealt <br/>
with are great people that really care about the environment and the <br/>
park they work in, and my beef is not with them.  It's with the <br/>
practices of the organization as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten a closer up view of the NPS than the average visitor <br/>
will, and I can respect their accomplishments.  But that doesn't make <br/>
them perfect, and it doesn't mean we should cut them any slack when <br/>
we see them doing something wrong.  Their hard-handed and closed-<br/>
minded attitude to letterboxing is wrong.<br/>

asked about the "policy" on letterboxes.  She said that they are so understaffed <br/>

feel it was necessary.  She believes it is an entirely laid-backed agency.  <br/>
Anyway, they have bigger fish to fry.<br/>
<br/>
I think it all depends on the personal feelings of the land manager.  LBNA <br/>
has had its share of irate land managers asking for removal of letterboxes, for <br/>
whatever reasons.  It's important to respect their views and wishes.  But I <br/>
don't believe all National Parks seek to remove all letterboxes.   Some national <br/>
parks allow it (or don't disallow it) and some don't.  The same goes for <br/>
state forest, nature conservancy, audubon, etc.  Some allow it some don't.  Common <br/>
sense goes a long way.  It is always a good idea to strongly consider the <br/>
impact of the letterbox on its surroundings.<br/>
