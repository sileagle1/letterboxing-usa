                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hope everyone doesn't mind me jumping in after just joining the group, but<br/>
I've been wondering the same thing lately.   After a year of boxing in the<br/>
Houston area, its painfully obvious that there are only a handful of people<br/>
actively planting boxes here. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One idea I've had is to plant boxes specifically for new boxers and list the<br/>
clues "somewhere else" other than AQ and LBNA.  This would let people try it<br/>
out on safe boxes that no one is too concerned about losing.   The boxes<br/>
could be donated stamps or laser cut (even store bought) to simplify things.<br/>
For example - say you provides a class/info session at the library, a local<br/>
community college, craft store or other group, you could share the clues<br/>
with the group which gives them a handful of boxes to go after.  If you have<br/>
a place that supports it you might even have them planted around the<br/>
building.   Then those who are really interested in it can go to the<br/>
websites and look for "real" boxes.  It's sort of like the newbie ring for<br/>
postal letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As for leaving boxes in public places.something similar has been done with<br/>
pathtags (the little collectable "coins" that are used for some of the<br/>
treasure hiking rewards on AQ.).  They can be logged when found, so several<br/>
people on the pathtag forums have tried leaving them in public places.  The<br/>
consensus is that the response rate was very low.   Boxes might work better<br/>
if you make it very clear what the finder needs to do with them.  <br/>

I too would not suggest placing out in the open. There are many issues with doing that, specially if u don't have permission. I am glad to see that others are wanting to share this fun hobby as well. My family and I got started in the whole hobby when we read an article in a newspaper about it. The whole thing just struck us as interesting. Now since that article a few local libraries have joined forces getting kids involved into the hobby. Mainly with the idea of get up and get outdoors slogan. Every summer the libraries hide a set of boxes and get kids together to give them a sheet that has space for all the stamps and gives them the clues. The adults have as much fun with this as all the children. We have crossed paths with a few famil,ies searching for the boxes on their list while we're searching for the more difficult ones. When we cross I explain the hobby more to them if they want to know. Word of mouth is the best way to get folks involved. I wish you best of luck with getting newbies involved, keep us posted if you get any ideas that work for you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">1.  I heard about letterboxing via my daughter seeing it written up in a home-schooling publication she was cataloging in her job as a librarian; had I seen it myself I would have pursued it.  One CAUTION is that if you get an article or an interview into media that people local to you will see, you absolutely have to make it clear to the interviewer/journalist some key points of letterboxing such as hiding boxes well after you've accessed them; the difference between LB and geocaching, the main difference being the art-work of a hand-carved stamp; and anything else you think a newbie should know (not all of them will read the etiquette and will not be good letterboxers, but that's a risk you take, and you can always educate them sometime down the road if they're doing something that isn't good like leaving boxes in plain sight, etc.  <br/>
2.  A new local letterboxer was introduced by his brother giving him a letterboxing "kit" - don't know what that is, but this person has really joined in and is doing a great job with good clues, good carvings, hiding well, etc.<br/>
3.  Another new local letterboxing family stumbled across a letterbox that was soaked, took it home, read about it via the insert that was inside the box, and then were hooked, and they are also a wonderful addition to my own local letterboxing community. <br/>
4.  A long-time boxer in my community is getting his church involved, and of course in that process he is obviously educating them as to the etiquette along the way.  This probably falls under telling your friends/relatives.<br/>
<br/>
So my suggestions are making sure your boxes have info pointing to both LBNA and AQ, telling your friends/relatives and maybe going further than that by giving them a little kit to get them started, and possibly getting an article into some local media, although that last one will be debated by others as being a good idea or not.  Probably depends how desperate you are for more boxers in your area!<br/>

I heard about letterboxing through a stamp carving online group (Carving Consortium). I loved the idea as soon as a read about it. I think the carving stamps part of letterboxing probably intimidates a lot of people but in my case I was already carving stamps so  this gave me another thing to do with my carved stamps.<br/>

There really is no better way.  I'm not really all that worried about the "mystique"; I *am* worried about boxes getting lost or stolen, or boxes being mistaken for terrorist weaponry (it has happened, and even more so with geocaches).  <br/>
<br/>
This isn't BookCrossing, after all.  Accidentally leaving a novel in a public place happens a lot, so deliberately leaving a book for someone else to pick up and read is not a big deal.  Leaving a box out in semi-public without permission is guaranteed to do one of three things: piss off the owner/manager of wherever; cause a minor panic; attract the attention of someone who we would just as soon not be involved.  Even with permission, the latter two are still possible, and at some point, whoever gave permission is going to get tired of keeping it safe.  Urban LBs, like urban caches, just don't last very long unless well hidden, and that would work at cross-purposes to your goal.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to attract new people and <br/>
&gt; tell them about the hobby without messing with the mystique of it? <br/>
<br/>
There really is no better way. I'm not really all that worried about the "mystique"; I *am* worried about boxes getting lost or stolen, or boxes being mistaken for terrorist weaponry (it has happened, and even more so with geocaches). <br/>
<br/>
This isn't BookCrossing, after all. Accidentally leaving a novel in a public place happens a lot, so deliberately leaving a book for someone else to pick up and read is not a big deal. Leaving a box out in semi-public without permission is guaranteed to do one of three things: piss off the owner/manager of wherever; cause a minor panic; attract the attention of someone who we would just as soon not be involved. Even with permission, the latter two are still possible, and at some point, whoever gave permission is going to get tired of keeping it safe. Urban LBs, like urban caches, just don't last very long unless well hidden, and that would work at cross-purposes to your goal. <br/>

Plant regular boxes in your normal style and that will create interest which will create more letterboxers and, happily, more letterboxes for you to find.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking of two parks here in southeastern PA which are saturated with boxes.  It happens all of the time - a letterboxer goes out to find a box and, while on trail, sees a spot that would also be perfect for a box.<br/>
<br/>
Also remember that letterboxers start out by hunting locally.  If they get hooked on the hobby then they build confidence and start to include clues in travel plans or organize trips around clues.<br/>
<br/>
So, you find a letterboxer by happening to plant a box near that person.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Along these lines the subject of newbies. I really think the best way to bring people into the hobby is WOM, taking someone out on the trail and showing them the ropes. Reading about letterboxing in a magazine or newspaper can leave out some very important points.<br/>
Case in point. I walk the trail behind my house almost every day with the dog as I go along I check on my boxes. 2 days ago every box had just a corner sticking out, I guess to make it easier for the next finder. Then yesterday the last box in the series was completly out in the open several feet away from it's hiding spot, sitting on a ledge. <br/>
I designed this series with newbies in mind but the most basic tenant of boxing is to re-hide well. One of the flaws of the letterboxing articles are they present the hobby as a kids game. To me it's an adult pastime kids can participate in. I started out with my kids but they have moved on.<br/>
Over the years I have told friends and acquaintances about boxing, most of the time I get a glazed over look or my favorite response "you have too much time on your hands".<br/>
Who are the ones who are interested? Outdoor types with an artistic bent.<br/>

&gt; As a newbie (one who is interested, but never tried it).  I think that, and maybe a couple "easy finds" might be a good way to attract people.  A local meet up group would be great, especially if you were able to offer a "getting started" class every so often.  I have to say, one of the reason's I haven't started is it all seems a bit difficult to me.  <br/>

&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions on how to attract new people and tell them about the hobby without messing with the mystique of it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've considered making a kind of floating hitchhiker or newbie box to be left in public places like under a chair in starbucks or in a library or something to that effect. Not very well hidden, but the point of this would be for people to find it, be curious, and learn about whats inside. Granted, this would have a high risk is disappearing. And there's always the risk the wrong kind of person could discover it and go on a box stealing spree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So it's just a thought. Does anyone else have any suggestions or ideas? I've also considering making a local meetup group...<br/>

My 2 cents - when explaining Letterboxing to anyone I always refer them to "wikipedia", just enter "letterboxing".  I think that site has a good overall explanation and doesn't carry any clues!  If a person takes the time to look it up, read it, and then go to LB.org or AQ they are probably already on the path to being hooked.<br/>
