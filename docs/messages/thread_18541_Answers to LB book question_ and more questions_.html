A couple days ago I asked this question to the list:<br/>
If a book were to be written on letterboxing, would<br/>
you want your stamps to be featured in it? Would you<br/>
want to contribute something written about yourself<br/>
(how you got into the hobby and what it means to<br/>
you)? Why or why not?<br/>
<br/>
The responses that I got are within this email. <br/>
<br/>
But now I have another question. Actually a couple:<br/>
<br/>
To what extent do you think a book written on<br/>
letterboxing would contribute to a greater public<br/>
awareness of the hobby? Is this awareness good or bad?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that the discovering or reading of the<br/>
book itself does not have to be the direct cause of<br/>
someones awareness. In other words a book could lead<br/>
to book reviews, magazine articles, and other media<br/>
exposures, thus increasing awareness. What effect<br/>
would increased awareness and publicity have on<br/>
letterboxing? <br/>
<br/>
Please respond to me personally at the email<br/>
provided. After a couple days, I will compile the<br/>
responses and send to the list. <br/>
<br/>
Send here:<br/>

<br/>
Thanks to all! <br/>
<br/>
Responses to first question: <br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
ABSOLUTELY I'd love to participate! I'm a newbie to<br/>
the sport but I'm also a freelance writer. :-)<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
I would not mind if my stamp were in it and I would be<br/>
willing to write up a short article about how we got<br/>
started and where we've gone in letterboxing. As to<br/>
why?? I would hope it would encourage others to join<br/>
the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
I would love to contribute, participate, or in any<br/>
other way be involved in a book on letterboxing. :)<br/>
I'm not one of the world's great carvers, but I'd be<br/>
happy to talk about how I got started, why I do it,<br/>
what I love about it, etc., etc. Let me know how the<br/>
project goes and if I can be part of it. Thanks and<br/>
happy boxing!<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
I am fairly new to letterboxing (P01 F06) but I am a<br/>
stay at home mom. This is a fantastic activity for my<br/>
2 year old and me to share. We get outside, find new<br/>
places, look for treasure! I wish I knew about it 2<br/>
years ago! I would have been tromping through old<br/>
cemeteries with my newborn in a sling! <br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
I think a book is a great idea. I would love to<br/>
contribute stamps, stories, etc. <br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
First thing that comes to mind. . .Everyone boxes for<br/>
a different reason; the hike, the wonderful places you<br/>
end up going to that you would never have seen without<br/>
'the hunt', adding to your PFX score, etc. But I think<br/>
we can all agree that seeing that image, finding out<br/>
what the box placer carved, that's justthe coolest<br/>
thing! I remember seeing the image of a stamp<br/>
accidentally in someone's journal before I'd hunted<br/>
for the box. BIG let down when I eventually did find<br/>
the box. Seemed like it was a 'been there, done<br/>
that'sort of thing.It's the intrigue of the unknown<br/>
treasure that drives some of us. So, while I do enjoy<br/>
seeing stamps I might never get to seeand they would<br/>
make lovely plates in a book, the stamp image is a<br/>
private thing that, in most cases, should be reserved<br/>
for the diligent who have endeavored to claim it.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
Ahhhhh there IS a book written on Letterboxing written<br/>
by list-owner Randy Hall (Letterboxer's Companion).<br/>
Its a fine book with several stamp images in it. We'd<br/>
be honored to have someone actually WANT our images in<br/>
a published book someday...but that's not likely to<br/>
happen :) As for contributions, we'd do what we<br/>
could to help spread the LB seed to the masses.... It<br/>
was only a matter of time...a book on letterboxing!!!<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
Surely. If we don't share knowledge, then we will<br/>
certainly share ignorance. What would you want to<br/>
know? I'm afraid that the only fairly-unique things<br/>
Diane and I have done are library letterbooks. Aside<br/>
from that, we're your typical Usual Suspects of<br/>
planters and finders.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
Sounds good to me, and I've only known about it for,<br/>
let's see...2 weeks!!!! I think it would be quite<br/>
interesting to see the cross section of people,<br/>
places, types of stamps etc. I'll be looking for it @<br/>
Barnes and Nobles!!!<br/>
