                    <div class="plaintext-content">We set our sights on finding at least 1 letterbox today (given our<br/>
track record) and instead we found 4!  We've tripled our found count<br/>
to 6!<br/>
<br/>
We found 2 in Bolton - nice little town - Bolton House of Pizza makes<br/>
delish pizza :) I think we found the 2 of the easiest ones (easy for<br/>
non-residents of Bolton) though and we especially loved the little<br/>
hike for the Powderhouse letterbox.  Great stamps too!  We bumped into<br/>
a very nice lady walking her dog in the woods by the Lime Kiln<br/>
letterbox and she accompanied us on our hunt for that 1st box.  She<br/>
had never heard of letterboxing, but she said that she was going to<br/>
come back with her german shepherd stamp and look for it again.<br/>
Unfortunately, the Lime Kiln box was pretty wet and many of the stamp<br/>
impressions in the log book were washed out.  :(  We dried it up as<br/>
best we could, though.   We hope to return to Bolton to find more of<br/>
those boxes (and hopefully we'll have a copy of the trail guide before<br/>
then!).<br/>
<br/>
And Shirley Center...what a beautiful and peaceful town.  We found<br/>
both boxes, but the Town Pound box was still empty save for Melissa<br/>
and Dan's note.  We visited the covered bridge (beautiful, Erik!) and<br/>
then returned home.<br/>
<br/>
Our best letterboxing day yet!<br/>
