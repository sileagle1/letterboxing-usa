visted by so many people (by our standards) in the past 4 yrs I <br/>
didn't want to risk loosing all the stamps in it.  I will replace it <br/>
soon with new log and maybe a more water tight container. I may try <br/>
copying the entries and adding them to the new log so that others <br/>
can still enjoy past visitors.  Also a reminder Box#14-VT and Box#23-<br/>
ME are missing.  Box#-23 contents were returned to me via mail due <br/>
to a very hungry rat chewing the stamp.  All three boxes will be <br/>
replaced soon.<br/>
