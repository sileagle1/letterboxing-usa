ORION the Hunter <br/>
Placed by The Doubtful Guests <br/>
October 18, 2002 <br/>
Washington, DC <br/>
Hand made stamp <br/>
Micro letterbox <br/>
The Einstein Memorial, Constitution Avenue NW at 22nd St. Step up on<br/>
to the black marble and look at Einstein. The tourists all climb on<br/>
him and get their picture taken. <br/>
Brace yourself before you look down. You are standing in the middle of<br/>
space. Below you are the stars of our sky. Just in front of you is the<br/>
bronze disk of the sun. Far to your left, you will find the tree stars<br/>
in a row of Orion's belt. Very distinctive in the sky, no three stars<br/>
line up quite like that, it is somewhat hard to find on this map.<br/>
(Pssst, there's a map in the free brochure.) Rigel and Betelgeuse<br/>
(often pronounced beetlejuice) are its two brightest stars. I am told<br/>
that in the original Arabic Betelgeuse means "armpit of the hunter". <br/>
The hunter aims his bow at some dim hare but it looks more as if he is<br/>
hunting the V shaped face of Taurus the bull. He will miss. His arrow<br/>
will fly on and past the tight star cluster of the Pleides. You must<br/>
follow it to reach your goal, on beyond the Sun and the crescent Moon<br/>
and up the sidewalk 14 cracks to a cedar on your left. Velcroed to a<br/>
small branch at eye level is the micro letterbox made of two film<br/>
canisters taped together. <br/>
Be discrete so that no tourist may see you and take or destroy it and<br/>
please replace it carefully obscured by greenery. <br/>
