                    <div class="plaintext-content">Depends on the art store.  There's one here in Denver that carries erasers that are perfect for carving in terms of size and quality.  They also carry Speedball Speedy Carve. As has been said already you want the PINK STUFF *not* the grey crumbly *&amp;^% that won't last at all.<br/>
<br/>
If you have no luck in a brick and mortar store in your area, http://www.stampeaz.com/ is the online store most letterboxers I know use.  They have many carving media for you to explore.  The owner is also a letterboxer.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Have you found any traditional boxes yet? If not, when you do you'll see how the carving material looks. Stamps in boxes can be all sizes but most are in the 2X2 range.Wood just doesn't take ink well for stamping. It is porous and aborbs the ink. You don't really need to get a grip on the stamp for stamping. <br/>
