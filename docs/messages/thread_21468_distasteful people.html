I'd still like to know if there is a correlation of people that do not prefer drive bys to their views on postal boxes.  I would think its a pleasant thing to get something fun in the mail.  Appreciate the views from the experienced PLBers.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Switching gears.  One of the messages I was reading this morning showed some hesitation over stamp carving, especially with all the talent around here.  Please don't be!  Try your hand, discover if you like it.  Everyone had a first time.  Don't just stop with one that you think is "baby carving" - practice improves all art forms!   Heh, its not my strong point either, but, that shouldn't stop me.  Sometimes though, a store bought solves a particular.  I'm currently looking for a beer mug.  I've got a pizza box (one of those triangle tupperware ones to save a slice) and want to plant a beer and pizza.  Will need a big area to place that one.<br/>

Anyone want to share a favorite placement of theirs?<br/>

With that in mind, why not take the opportunity to open things up a<br/>
little?  I think there are a lot of valid points on the table on both<br/>
sides of the argument--although i fear sounding all hokey here, i<br/>
think this might be a good chance for people to get a better<br/>
understanding of why people letterbox in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
So, if no one minds me stepping in (i mainly lurk, so most of you<br/>
probably don't know me at all, and i'm not one of the "old-timers"<br/>
here, and my find count is still fairly small...), what was it that<br/>
drew you to letterboxing?  And if you've been doing it for a while,<br/>
has that initial draw remained the driving factor behind you<br/>
continuing, or has it changed (and how)?<br/>
<br/>
For me, what drew me to letterboxing was the puzzle aspect of it--i<br/>
guess you could call it the hunt aspect.  I like solving puzzles,<br/>
solving mysteries, and this seemed like a great way of combining a<br/>
bunch of things i enjoy.  I've got bad knees and asthma, so i can't do<br/>
the big ten-mile hikes, but i don't think that means that the game<br/>
shouldn't exist for people like me.  I tend to favor urban boxes,<br/>
partly because i find the thrill of making the find in public places a<br/>
little more exciting, a little more dangerous.  I don't think i've<br/>
been in the sport long enough for what drives me to change, though<br/>
i've noticed that with every expedition, i hope more and more that the<br/>
stamp is hand-carved and unique.<br/>

This will probably get me flamed as well, but this is probably why <br/>
the number of posts on the main list has dwindled over the past <br/>
couple of years.  You can see this when you go to the home link at <br/>
the left.<br/>
<br/>
The occaisional hostility (especially directed at new or 'different' <br/>
folks) has driven people to not post or retreat to the more friendly <br/>
confines of regional or specialty lists (PLB List for PLB fans, <br/>
Newboxers, Boxheads, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that is desireable for some...<br/>
<br/>
Just illustrating this, so as I done my asbestos underware,<br/>

Okay, I'll bite. I am not new to boxing or the avid boxer most of <br/>
you are (proud of my less than 50 finds in 2 years thank you!) and I <br/>
am not a frequent poster to this board. It is rather intimadating to <br/>
post when every 5 posts or so is an attack against someone. It keeps <br/>
me from posting in here much and going off to look for a small, more <br/>
friendly letterboxing community board. I don't care who said what to <br/>
whom about what. Everyone will always have differing opinions, <br/>
sometimes good and sometimes not so good, after all, we are HUMAN. <br/>
<br/>
The big draw to letterboxing for me 2 years ago was the adventure of <br/>
the hunt and the chance to incorporate my family into one hobby <br/>
together. Letterboxing has made us closer and has given my son and I <br/>
something in common to do together. That in itself is pretty amazing <br/>
considering kids and adults usually have such different hobbies and <br/>
interests. Letterboxing has helped build a great relationship <br/>
between all of us.  <br/>
<br/>
The driving factor has changed for me somewhat. I still enjoy the <br/>
adventure of the hunt and the family time, but I have added to that <br/>
with my ongoing interest with the art of the stamp and carving. <br/>
<br/>
A nice thing that has happened because of letterboxing is meeting <br/>
people in the letterboxing community. Some are actually suprisingly <br/>
very nice. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Circus, for the opportunity to talk about how boxing has <br/>
effected me.<br/>

&gt; So, if no one minds me stepping in (i mainly lurk, so most of you<br/>
&gt; probably don't know me at all, and i'm not one of the "old-timers"<br/>
&gt; here, and my find count is still fairly small...), what was it that<br/>
&gt; drew you to letterboxing?  And if you've been doing it for a while,<br/>
&gt; has that initial draw remained the driving factor behind you<br/>
&gt; continuing, or has it changed (and how)?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For me, what drew me to letterboxing was the puzzle aspect of it--i<br/>
&gt; guess you could call it the hunt aspect.  I like solving puzzles,<br/>
&gt; solving mysteries, and this seemed like a great way of combining a<br/>
&gt; bunch of things i enjoy.  I've got bad knees and asthma, so i <br/>
can't do<br/>
&gt; the big ten-mile hikes, but i don't think that means that the game<br/>
&gt; shouldn't exist for people like me.  I tend to favor urban boxes,<br/>
&gt; partly because i find the thrill of making the find in public <br/>
places a<br/>
&gt; little more exciting, a little more dangerous.  I don't think i've<br/>
&gt; been in the sport long enough for what drives me to change, though<br/>
&gt; i've noticed that with every expedition, i hope more and more that <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; stamp is hand-carved and unique.<br/>

I will probably get blasted for this, but I am thankful that a <br/>
Journalist was inspired to write a letterboxing article in our local <br/>
paper.  If they hadn't, who knows when I would have found out about <br/>
letterboxing.  This is something that I truly enjoy &amp; it enhances our <br/>
family time together.<br/>

for daring to admit my chosen profession (I'm a journalist, I guess <br/>
some people consider that open season). <br/>

&gt; This will probably get me flamed as well, but this is probably why <br/>
&gt; the number of posts on the main list has dwindled over the past <br/>
&gt; couple of years.  You can see this when you go to the home link at <br/>
&gt; the left.<br/>

Dearest Bug,<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship must respectfully disagree. It is her Ladyship's opinion<br/>
that there just haven't been as many flames in the past year. It is<br/>
the flames that cause the number of posts to skyrocket. Last year was<br/>
one of flame after flame after glorious flame.<br/>
<br/>
Our dear newbies should never fear speaking up, however. This troubles<br/>
her Ladyship. As our dear friend Auntie Mame said, "you've got to live<br/>
Agnes, LIVE!" Just jump right in there and damn the consequences. Her<br/>
Ladyship has recently seen the sort of unprovoked attack on her<br/>
character that our newbies purportedly fear. This repugnant campaign<br/>
to falsely smear her reputation will not however cause her Ladyship to<br/>
shrink in fear. Her Ladyship shall sally forth, head held high. The<br/>
viscous lies spread about her Ladyship obviously come from an insecure<br/>
and wounded soul who vainly attempts to regain his lost self-esteem by<br/>
attacking everyone around him. We all see the downward spiral of<br/>
hatred that this causes but alas there is nothing we can do but heed<br/>
the wise words of William Earnest Henley:<br/>
<br/>
"In the fell clutch of circumstance	        <br/>
  I have not winced nor cried aloud.	 <br/>
Under the bludgeonings of chance	 <br/>
  My head is bloody, but unbowed."<br/>
<br/>
So, go ye captains of your fate and post what you will. No one can<br/>
conquer your soul, only you can surrender it. Be not complicit in your<br/>
own demise.<br/>
