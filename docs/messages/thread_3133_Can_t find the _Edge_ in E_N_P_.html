I just read your message after posting a request to know if anyone <br/>
had looked for my boxes in the Everglades. How strange. Please <br/>
contact me off list and let's see if you were in the right place. The <br/>
National Park service may have  removed some geocaches from the <br/>
Everglades and I am wondering if my letterboxes have met the same <br/>
fate. Hope not. Please contact me off list and tell me in detail <br/>
where you think the edge of the swamp box was located. Thanks!<br/>

After discussions with the person who had tried to find my "edge of <br/>
the swamp" box, I believe it is _very_ likely gone missing. I suspect <br/>
that the NPS has removed it as they appear to be doing in other <br/>
places. I don't know if they have removed the "deep in the swamp" <br/>
box, that would require a little more motivation (and a lot more <br/>
blood loss this time of year). I will hopefully be back down there in <br/>
October on a fishing trip and will check the situation at that time. <br/>
I would still suggest you check out the area where the edge was <br/>
placed. Lots of interesting things to see there. If anyone out there <br/>
likes backcountry salt water fishing, IMHO there is no better place <br/>
than Everglades National Park. Ever hooked a 100+ pound tarpon in 8 <br/>
inches of water? They say well over 90% of repeat visitors to the <br/>
park are fishermen. There is good reason.  I might even be willing to <br/>
send some cryptic clues about fishing spots if someone asks about it <br/>
;-)<br/>

Could you please add a note to the LbNA clues pages for my Everglades <br/>
letterboxes stating that the "edge of the swamp" box has likely been <br/>
removed and the "deep in the swamp" status is currently unknown. I <br/>
would hate for people to travel all the way out there (it's a long <br/>
way from civilization) hunting boxes the NPS may have removed. Thanks.<br/>
