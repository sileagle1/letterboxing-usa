Subject: questions<br/>
Date: Mon, 30 Jun 2003<br/>
<br/>
I just found my first box and enjoyed finding it.  I have a couple of<br/>
questions though.  When finding a box and after it is stamped do I need to<br/>
write something in the book and if so what?  The next question is do I have<br/>
to be registered to find boxes? Last question do I have to use the same<br/>
stamp all the time?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
                    Thank You,<br/>
<br/>
                      T. Berg<br/>

<br/>
A hitchhiker is a stamp (with logbook) that gets placed into another <br/>
LB. When it is found, the finder stamps in, gets a copy of the stamp, <br/>
and then places it in another LB. This way, the HH travels around from <br/>
LB to LB. Generally (though some will have other instructions), you <br/>
announce where it was found, but not where it was dropped off. Most HHs <br/>
travel to be surprise finds, but some might ask that you announce the <br/>
drop-off location so that it can be found more quickly.....<br/>
<br/>
Traveler is a more generic term. I believe that in England, where this <br/>
started, it's the same as what we call a hitchhiker. Here, it is often <br/>
a personal traveler, sort of an extra stamp some LBers carry and <br/>
exchange if you know the password, figure out a puzzle, or just ask, <br/>
depending on their personal preference. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure someone else will be able to post the right links to get more <br/>
info on each, plus plenty of other LB topics.<br/>
<br/>

thanks, I didn't think the moderator was going to<br/>
publish this,,,sent a link to the faq page... I should<br/>
have known... we hike in the fall and spring with our<br/>
counties hiking spree and I noticed several of the<br/>
hikes have lb's... wish I had known about this a<br/>
couple weeks ago we were at cleveland science center<br/>
and there is supposed to be one at the rock n roll<br/>
hall of fame right next door...  I'll have to travel<br/>
the 30 minutes to get there another time.... it will<br/>
be fun to find an urban box.  <br/>
thanks for the answer and the welcome... this one will<br/>
at least get me outside and walking... <br/>
how many of us pezzers are there in this do you think.<br/>
