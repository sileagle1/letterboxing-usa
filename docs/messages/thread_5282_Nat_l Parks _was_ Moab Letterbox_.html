<br/>
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be "sneaky". Perhaps "secretive", or "confident=<br/>
ial", but not "sneaky"!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think the pamphlet points out that there are some dramatic differ=<br/>
ences between U.K. and <br/>
U.S. National Park philosophy that may explain the differing positions on l=<br/>
etterboxing. In the U.S., it <br/>
seems that National Parks are caught in a paradox between keeping these lan=<br/>
ds open and accessible to <br/>
all as public-owned treasures, and protecting them as closed, inaccessible =<br/>
Wilderness, un-soiled by <br/>
human contact. In the U.S. we have a mythology that wild areas are pristine=<br/>
, untrammelled Edens (as <br/>
if Native Americans had not been living here and affecting the environment =<br/>
for thousands of years... <br/>
but that is another off-topic discussion). Most large U.S. National Parks a=<br/>
re managed to try to <br/>
recreate that pristine, un-touched wilderness.<br/>
<br/>
I think the NPS policy about letterboxing and geocaching is based in part o=<br/>
n their objections to <br/>
disturbing habitat/trampling new trails/fears of "digging", etc. but also a=<br/>
 blanket policy against <br/>
litter in the parks. The fines for geocachers I heard about were simply fin=<br/>
es for littering, which can <br/>
be up to $500.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the response..<br/>
<br/>
I was pleased to see your thoughts and the many replies about this issue.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I might reply to LbNA but then maybe as I am a Brit I thought<br/>
perhaps I should keep out of the discussion...<br/>
<br/>
but well here is is...and I hope that's OK...<br/>
<br/>
Before I add a few more pennies worth do let me assure all that I wasn't<br/>
trying to suggest that thee or anyone in particular was being sneaky....<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the NPS do a great job but I do believe that like all govt<br/>
dept folks,these folk will need time to learn about, appreciate and adapt<br/>
to the changes in the world...like Letterboxing<br/>
<br/>
Keeping the parks pristine is fine and worthy..Lucky for you to have<br/>
pristine parks...<br/>
<br/>
Dartmoor is not pristine.<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere in England is natural...everything has had the hand of man on it !<br/>
<br/>
So we don't have the same perspectives....However, our moor has its own<br/>
heritage too.<br/>
<br/>
It has stone age towns on it...as old as Stonehenge..It has middle stone<br/>
age stone circles and lines of stones....hundreds ! They are very mystic<br/>
and eerie.   It has Celtic and Viking  crosses and ancient Christian<br/>
remains ..It has early (very early) ancient trackways and pack horse<br/>
trails..it has stone "clapper bridges" from the same period..it has a moor<br/>
wide contour water system (like tiny canals) called leats that date from<br/>
the middle ages ..it has field patterns of early settlement, early<br/>
industrial remains, old water mills, foundries, smelting plants, even dark<br/>
underground mine workings a wonder to discover...Then on top again there<br/>
are rail and track systems for man hauling minerals, to horse ways and all<br/>
kinds of railroad remains up to and including the age of steam...It has a<br/>
Napoleonic period prison and man made reservoirs, lakes and<br/>
forests.....From the green perspective it has strange and rare plants,<br/>
bottomless quaking mires, clamberable hills dotted with freely wandering<br/>
ponies, and other wandering rare breed animals; butterflies and other<br/>
curious insects and so many birds that some days it is hard to miss their<br/>
wheeling and joyful chatter...and it has Tors..strange outcrops of rock<br/>
with ancient geological significance...Dartmoor is also the high plateau<br/>
that is the source and home of the River Dart which frequently changes<br/>
from a wide tranquil waterway in which to bath or picnic besides into a<br/>
murderous white water torrent ..and all in a matter of minutes..It has<br/>
legends of ghosts, devils, mad abbots, demons, witches, hairy hands, The<br/>
Baskerfield Hounds,  and "old folk" (like benign elves).  It even has a<br/>
mysterious "beast" which (supposedly) stalks the moors...which many have<br/>
seen..I even claim to have "heard its heavy footfalls and soft breathing"<br/>
!  It has deep mist pockets, bright hilltops and green swaths of empty<br/>
moorland...Quite a magic kingdom in fact ....If Disney had designed<br/>
it...folk would say there are too may E-rides !<br/>
<br/>
Despite all this ..it is open and free to wander and enjoy !<br/>
<br/>
Certainly we are careful to preserve the landscape...and we move (and<br/>
re-site) our boxes to avoid tracks and wear to the landscape.<br/>
<br/>
But all of this is in a tiny area compared with any park in the US....No<br/>
Letterboxing in the USA can have the effect that 10,000 boxes in 365<br/>
square miles can have on Dartmoor !<br/>
<br/>
...and thousands of walkers enjoy Dartmoor every year and have no idea<br/>
that the boxes are there..and can't even see em !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So that is our experience...<br/>
<br/>
Now maybe if I may be permitted...can I add another two cents about maybe<br/>
what might happen in your own back yard...<br/>
<br/>
and yeah, "sure", its none of my business..<br/>
<br/>
so again here I go where angels fear to tread...<br/>
<br/>
This is just one old man's thoughts ...with respect...<br/>
<br/>
May I suggest that maybe NOW is the time to be proactive in defence of the<br/>
hobby in the USA.<br/>
<br/>
Lobby your representative and get the game recognised and understood...<br/>
<br/>
Make First Contact..<br/>
<br/>
Don't wait for a NO !<br/>
<br/>
Go out and explain why yes is the only answer...<br/>
<br/>
As to Geocachers ..well, either make love or war..but I think that the<br/>
decision must be made..are they an enemy or should you all be on the same<br/>
team...?<br/>
<br/>
Luckily we don't have to chose here..we only have boxing.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't keep looking out for and worrying about tales of fines and<br/>
strange notes and phantom memos. <br/>
<br/>
If Letterboxing is worth the penny then its worth a letter or email to<br/>
your local and national elected politicians to advise them what you are<br/>
doing and to help them to do the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
One day I've gotta get me some US F counts ... I am just waiting till you<br/>
get enough boxes sited to make it easier for me ! <lol><br/>
<br/>
So do please protect the hobby..even if only for me ! <grin><br/>
<br/>
That's the end of my 2c worth...!<br/>
<br/>
I will now certainly keep my head down...<bigger grin=""><br/>
<br/>
Hope what I have said doesn't offend...I didn't intend to do so !<br/>
<br/>
Just Happy Boxing to us all !<br/>

Words of the Wise from afar. Thanks , 2 cents can buy a lot even in <br/>
these times. We would be wise to begin a quiet campaign to  make our <br/>
hobby an accepted form of park use.  It can happen I am happy to say <br/>
that my Mansfield Hollow Park has been most welcoming. I did not <br/>
approach them but since the planting of the boxes it has become <br/>
recognised and accepted  I became a member of the board of "Friends <br/>
of Mansfield Hollow" which has members of many park use groups. ( <br/>
Bikers, canoe club , dog walkers, ball players , fishing and <br/>
LETTERBOXING) now I have a local voice and so many others understand <br/>
our purpose. I would like  to think it can be done. It may be a slow <br/>
process to recieve acceptance in the national Parks but  'pursuit of <br/>
happiness 'is an American ideal lets exercise it through the right <br/>
channels. <br/>
      Someone once called the Hollow my Dartmoor I was so pleased <br/>
with the comparison in term, but it is nothing in reality, your <br/>
history and geographic wonders  and of course wild ponies can't be <br/>
matched anywhere. Someday I hope to see it. Someday I hope you see <br/>
ours. Thanks for always listening, and for the ocasional 2 cents. <br/>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wow, Graham, that was a fabulously inspiring 
description of Dartmoor.  I'll be in the UK in October.  Dartmoor just 
moved onto my itinerary with flashing lights and a siren... I MUST see this from 
your description!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for sharing so much 
information!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And to folks in the Northeast US, I'll be at the 
Gathering on Saturday, and hope to meet many people.  I've carved a stamp 
for this, too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>See you soon!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello letterboxers and geocachers<br/>
<br/>
Hello friends...<br/>
<br/>
I have had such a flurry of personal emails it is hard to respond to<br/>
them...<br/>
<br/>
But now I have to say openly on this list "SORRY I WAS WRONG" !<br/>
<br/>
Ooops..!<br/>
<br/>
"""No "Them &amp; Us" here please !"""<br/>
<br/>
My many friends in the WOM* (word of mouth) letterboxing community have<br/>
been emailing me to let me know...and a wonderful young woman from San<br/>
Diego also put me straight ...Thanks again Jane...(The freedom of the<br/>
internet is magic isn't it !)<br/>
<br/>
****So what did I get wrong ?<br/>
<br/>
Well it transpires that..<br/>
<br/>
"There are loads of geocahes here in the UK and on Dartmoor too !"<br/>
<br/>
Ooops I am getting old and out of touch !<br/>
<br/>
But perhaps the most important thing is that the UK parks authorities see<br/>
both hobbies as equally valid and decent.  They simply ask that both<br/>
communities be as careful and caring on the the moor and respect THE SAME<br/>
rules !<br/>
<br/>
So if ever the evidence for "No more Them and Us" was needed ..well there<br/>
it is !<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we Brits can say that we brought Letterboxing to the US ..but<br/>
certainly you have sent us geocaching back and I am told it is alive and<br/>
well in Britain !<br/>
<br/>
So now its definitely down to you good folk..like Carol - Leader of the<br/>
Pack in Mansfield Hollow Park to help the NPA appreciate the<br/>
hobbies...becoming a friend of the park is a great idea...If you love to<br/>
walk and enjoy the park then you surely are already its friend...<br/>
<br/>
I do believe that "fear of the unknown" can cause the most serious errors<br/>
and decisions...even between hobbyist like geocachers and letterboxers. <br/>
So how much more likely a misunderstanding between someone who has a duty<br/>
of care (like a ranger) faced by a strange person who hides stuff in their<br/>
domain ?...and if they then read their contact-lists they will find<br/>
comparable claims that each other hobby is digging full blown quarries to<br/>
hide their stuff too ! <br/>
<br/>
But when we explain the quiet gentle way we go about it and the craft and<br/>
the care and decent way we respect the environment and the mystery and<br/>
puzzling and clues and the walking in wonderful places and then hunting<br/>
for "treasure" ..and even the voyages of discovery of the open country for<br/>
young children too...wow <br/>
<br/>
..How can they ban that ???<br/>
<br/>
(even if you get wet and cold and dirty and tired and frustrated by these<br/>
*** clues !...<lol>)<br/>
<br/>
I advocate a peace treaty be signed soon .. or  "lets make love not war"...<br/>
<br/>
Then a pro-active mutual message will surely be most powerful !<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then PAX BRITANICUS to us all <roflol><br/>
<br/>
(OK maybe "that" is going too far <grin>)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So Happy Boxing to us all (and geocaching too) <br/>
<br/>
Long live the caring letterboxers<br/>
Long live the caring geocachers<br/>
