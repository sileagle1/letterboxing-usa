This may be extra email for you if someone else already got back to <br/>
you. But a Hitch Hiker (HH) is a Letterbox that does not reside in <br/>
it's own box. One places it in an existing box clearly marked "Hitch <br/>
Hiker", with it's own name. Thus when a letterboxer comes along &amp; <br/>
finds it, they take it with them and place it in a box during their <br/>
future travels. Doesn't have to stay within the state, infact, it's <br/>
fun when they travel out of state. On the homepage for letterboxing, <br/>
there's an explanation for all this, just go poking around and read up <br/>

Glad you got the HH info. Poke around in the groups and you'll find <br/>
more info regarding all this. Yes, you're right the girls dogs barked <br/>
very loud last night. Good for them! They've been strong for a while <br/>
now. I'm two towns over east of you in a small town with no sidewalks, <br/>
no street lights and no stores. (of course that describes almost all <br/>
of the SMALL north eastern towns in CT.) Being that we live in the <br/>
land of small eastern towns, that's not very far from you at all.<br/>
Enjoy letterboxing and hope you come across HH's. Look into joining <br/>
the HH group, that'll point you in the right direction.<br/>
Always, <br/>
jurneez and Vinnie the dog.<br/>

I actually responded back this afternoon but I don't see my email online but<br/>
then the cyberspace email patrol gets them sometimes (who ever they are).<br/>
It's all so electronic and sometimes it gets away from<br/>
us.......vaporize.....I see others have welcome you too. It's a great group<br/>
of folks, and to narrow down the volume of u.s. emails there is a CT group.<br/>
I'm two towns east and just a little south of you, and for this corner of CT<br/>
that's not very far. All these small towns have no sidewalks, no street<br/>
lights and very many cows and lots of xmas trees. BUT we like it that way.<br/>
AND yes the girls dogs barked very loud last night, good for them, they've<br/>
been strong for sometime now. Enjoy letterboxing, I usually go on weekends,<br/>
perhaps we'll run into each other. Spring is on it's way, yahoo!!!!!!!!<br/>

Not sure if I'll take the dog this time. Sometimes he slows me down with all that sniffing he wants to do. I might want to check on my own boxes as well. We'll be in a pick up truck, rather gray/silver in color if you're out poking around. Hope you enjoy the weekend as I hope to. Who's Wildcat &amp; The Little Mouse? (is that right?)<br/>

several new ones near by so off I shall go for a few hours. Not sure <br/>
if I'll take the dog this time. Sometimes he slows me down with all <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Piglet,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This may be extra email for you if someone else already got <br/>
back <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you. But a Hitch Hiker (HH) is a Letterbox that does not <br/>
reside <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's own box. One places it in an existing box clearly marked <br/>
&gt; "Hitch<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hiker", with it's own name. Thus when a letterboxer comes <br/>
along <br/>
&gt; &amp;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finds it, they take it with them and place it in a box during <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; future travels. Doesn't have to stay within the state, infact, <br/>
&gt; it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fun when they travel out of state. On the homepage for <br/>
&gt; letterboxing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there's an explanation for all this, just go poking around and <br/>
&gt; read<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on things. There's also a section to join "groups". Recently <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started a group for the HH's and folks are posting tidbits of <br/>
&gt; info<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there. I do hope you enjoy letterboxing. With Spring coming, <br/>
&gt; it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be fun. What part of CT are you from?<br/>

   Hi Peppermint Patti,<br/>
 I think I found a hitch hiker of yours. this<br/>
week-end.<br/>
I was most excited to find my first one it was in one<br/>
of BOXdn boxes.The e-mail address listed in to log<br/>
isn't this one so I want to be sure that your the one.<br/>
Are you or did you plant a HH in Mass?<br/>
Since I'm new to all this I'm not sure what I can or<br/>
should say about this find on the list so if you need<br/>
to e-mail please free to use the bayougrits@yahoo<br/>
address.<br/>
Grits,<br/>
Happy Trails<br/>

&gt; I didn't realize Personal Travelers are actually<br/>

&gt; their own log books. I exchange my personal stamp<br/>
&gt; but if someone should ask me about my personal<br/>
&gt; travelers they also receive those stamps. And I<br/>
&gt; count them as exchanges. IMO it's too cumbersome to<br/>

 Subject: [LbNA] Hitch Hiker<br/>
<br/>
     I was doing a routine maintenance on one of my boxes and found a HH. <br/>
 There was no book, just the stamp. I left the stamp there for someone <br/>
 else to find and move. There was an email addy on the stamp, so I <br/>
 emailed them to let them know the stamp was ok and on the move. The <br/>
 email came back as undeliverable. I checked NALB and AQ and there is <br/>
 no HH listed under the name "Swiper". Does anyone know who released <br/>
 this stamp and how to get hold of them? I would appreciate any help. <br/>
 Thanks, Hales Angels<br/>

Here in Conn. there is a letterboxer by the trailname "Swiper", <br/>
perhaps of the four-footed variety...check out the "Swiper" boxes on <br/>
LbNA.  There are no HH's listed but there are several boxes named for <br/>
and about Swiper's activities.  You might try the LbNA link to contact <br/>
placer.<br/>
