                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do understand that the Southern CA region is a long way away from <br/>
San Luis Obispo county. It would be great to attend a boxing festival <br/>
down in your neck of the woods, too. I would like to attend any that <br/>
are held in SF or Sacremento, as well.<br/>
<br/>
By my quick count, there are about 76 letterboxes in the San Luis <br/>
Obispo coastal area. While that is small potatos compaired to <br/>
Connecticut (what do you folks in Connecticut have in your water, <br/>
anyway?!), it is pretty lush for boxing. <br/>
<br/>
Some of these boxes, like my Middle Earth Series (10 and growing), <br/>
need to be decoded first and some, like Ryan's Carpenter's Walking <br/>
Tour, may only be decoded after you get here.<br/>
<br/>
Even if we do not have a festival here, and we do want one, it is a <br/>
nice location to visit and to box. It is kind of discouraging to <br/>
check in on your box to find no one new has stamped in. If you are <br/>
coming to this region, please, check in with JugglerMouse or me. We <br/>
can give you some help with how difficult the boxes are for differing <br/>
physical conditions. Besides, we would love to have some more <br/>
exchanges.<br/>
