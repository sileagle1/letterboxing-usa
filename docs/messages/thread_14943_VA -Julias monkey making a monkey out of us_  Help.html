                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All!  We are having a lot of fun here at Wintergreen (except for this <br/>
funky tiny keyboard and this REALLY slow internet connection...<br/>
<br/>
We had no luck with Julias's monkey this afternoon and thougth we would put <br/>
out a quick call to whomever might now to find out if we were in the right <br/>
place (before we head back to DC)<br/>
<br/>
We stood on the rock and looked down and forward very close by.  We saw a <br/>
nice ledge like place but not box (onthe rock side == not the sign side).  <br/>
It looked like a very cool place to hide a box except for all the holes <br/>
heading way down all around it.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if this is the right place?  Don't want to be too specific, <br/>
but...<br/>
<br/>
All and any help would be appreciated!  Thanks!  BeMa<br/>
<br/>
