boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Who Whooo Slept Here?<br/>
Box was well hidden in great shape.  Loved the clues.  Was thankful for the <br/>
calculator function on my cell phone - math is not my strong point!  The park <br/>
is absolutely glorious.  My parents live not too far from there, and I had <br/>
never been before.  The Occoquan Bay is just beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Remembering MK<br/>
Box was lying out very exposed.  But it was in good shape.  We rehid it and <br/>
covered it well.  <br/>
<br/>
Odie's Dream<br/>
Busy busy park!  Lots of 4th of July celebrating going on.  The outside bag <br/>
around the box was destroyed, so we replaced it.  <br/>
<br/>
Top Secret<br/>
Again - beautiful beautiful location.  We hung out in the gazebo for a long <br/>
time just enjoying the breeze.  While looking under the gazebo, I was a little <br/>
startled to find the skeletal remains of some unfortunate critter.  We guessed <br/>
that it was probably a raccoon or something of that size.  I'm just really <br/>
glad I looked before I reached under there!  Pulling out a skull instead of a <br/>
letterbox would have been more than a little icky!<br/>
<br/>
After a day of boxing, we braved the crowds and headed into DC for the <br/>
fireworks.  Great display!  We however, sat way to close to where they were shooting <br/>
the fireworks from.  By the end of the display, we were COVERED in ash and <br/>
schrapnel!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the VA boxers!  We had a wonderful 4th of July!<br/>
