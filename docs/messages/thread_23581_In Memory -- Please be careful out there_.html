                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do not mean to bring those who read this down, but I think there's a valuable message to be understood here.<br/>
<br/>
  Those in the Pacific Northwest may have heard of the recent murder of two women who were hiking in the Cascade Mountains of Washington last week, not far from Seattle.  I had heard some about it on the radio, but did not realize until today that they were people I knew.<br/>
<br/>
  Susanna was a roommate of mine while at college in Bellingham, and one of the best tennants and people I met there.  She was a very experienced hiker and responsible about the dangers of the wilderness and always took precautions.  She left notes on our white board for longer hikes, "If I'm not back at 6, call my mother" with contact numbers.  Despite all this, she and her mother were both shot for some unknown reason while on the trail.  There is speculation that they simply happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, as it is rare for those who are not alone to be targeted like this.<br/>
<br/>
  I'll have to start practicing what I preach, myself, here, but please please take a buddy or two or more with you whenever you go hiking, particularly on longer hikes.  Enjoy the wilderness, as I know we all love it, but remember safety in numbers.<br/>

<br/>
  If I may add, a friend of mine was involved in a serious accident this last week that killed a women. He drifted into her lane and hit her straight on. I know nothing else. What I am getting at is, there are a lot of us going out and searching for boxes. Even before we make it to a box location, we are searching for a road or a sign for a trail, not paying attention to where are cars are heading. Even though we are all out there at some point, by ourselves, we must always keep our eyes on the road. I will be the first to admit, that I have drifted over the lines in search of a box. luckly there were no on coming traffic, and living in new hampshire, the trees are plenty here too!<br/>
<br/>
  Also, before I took some well needed time off, I was a very aggressive boxer. I went out to find boxes at any cost. There were times when I was so tired. Don't do what I was doing. Driving while tired is just like driving while drunk. I have fallen asleep at the wheel more than my share of times and I was involved in an accident about 10 years ago. I fell asleep. No I didn't hit anyone, but I damaged the car I was driving. You think I would have learned. I have now at a friends account.<br/>
<br/>
  Please don't drive when you are tired. Don't drive when you are drunk. Please keep your eyes on the road at all times. And don't walk into the woods alone if you can. One of our own has already lost a friend and her mother. I have a friend in a tough spot. Lets all remember the fallen and learn from the situations from which they were involved.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was wondering what was going on. I have been working and I have not <br/>
heard any news for several days in the Seattle area. I had mentioned <br/>
yesterday and today to a couple of Seattle Flight Attendants and <br/>
Pilots that Ryan and I were planning a camping/hiking trip next week. <br/>
Everyone asked me if I was going to take a gun with me!! 3 different <br/>
people said this exact thing when I mentioned our camping trip.  So <br/>
now I know what they were talking about!  I thought maybe there was a <br/>
rabid bear or mountain lion out there...<br/>
