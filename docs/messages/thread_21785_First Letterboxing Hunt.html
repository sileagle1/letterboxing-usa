Hi all!  I just wanted to share about our first letterboxing hunt.  We <br/>
went out to Marlinton, WV for the weekend and there are three in that <br/>
area -- one at Droop Mountain, one at Beartown State Park and one in <br/>
Watoga State Park.  We found Droop Mountain's first.  The box is a bit <br/>
crushed (the lid) and it was wet and buggy inside.  But the book was in <br/>
two baggies, so the book and the stamp were fine.  The stamp is <br/>
awesome!  A lot of work went into it.  From there we went to Beartown.  <br/>
That box was in excellent shape.  We had a picnic there, then had to <br/>
return home.  My son was very disappointed that we weren't going to <br/>
look for the Watoga box, but we promised we would go back for it next <br/>
time.  Next time we also hope to stop and find the Hills Creek Falls <br/>
box on our way to Marlinton, because we pass right by it.<br/>
<br/>
My son is very excited about looking for the next boxes.  He carved his <br/>
own stamp in preparation for this trip with the help of his father.  I <br/>
think we will get him his own stamp pad for the next trip.<br/>

Stamp Pad?!<br/>
It won't be long before you have multiple ink pads in various colors <br/>
and hues. Why stop at ink pads? Go get some multi-colored pens for <br/>
those intricate nuances. Then you need your own secret traveling <br/>
stamp, and then your super secret traveler. Happy addiction.<br/>

his own income ;)  I have my own addiction to feed, afterall!<br/>
