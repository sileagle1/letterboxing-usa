<div>My wife and I went out to find some boxes here in 
the LA area yesterday.  Here's the skinny on what we found : </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Descanso Garden - Feather Falls - Alive and well. 
If you are planning to look for this one, we recommend doing it now.  All 
of the Camellias are in bloom.</div>
<div>Descanso Garden - Camellia Forest - Alive and 
well.</div>
<div>Descanso Garden - Chaparral Trail - Alive and 
well.</div>
<div>Descanso Garden - Enchanted Garden Railroad Bonus 
Box - Alive and well</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Eaton Canyon - Alive and well.  We had a 
little trouble finding it by following the clues but I was able to use the Force 
to discern the location (i.e. I looked around and saw a tree that looked like 
the one described...)</div>
<div>Eaton Canyon Hummingbird - Alive and well.  
This one tried my wife's patience.  She doesn't have a great sense of 
balance so all the stream crossings while trying to find the trail were not fun 
to her.  The falls at the end of the hike were worth it but the area is 
pretty well trafficked and the location where the box is hidden is visible to 
people headed to the falls.  People kept looking up at me as I was sitting 
by the box location waiting for the crowds to die down so I could get it.  
I ended up pretending that my GPS receiver was a camera and that I was trying to 
take a picture.  It WORKED!  I even had one woman move behind a rock 
so she wouldn't be in my picture!!!  I'm planning on bringing a camera on 
all my hunts from now on!!</div>

</p><p>I always take my camera when boxing for two reasons:  one is that I like to take pictures of the areas where I find boxes to keep in the logbook/scrapbook I keep my finds in.  Second is that I have often pretended to be taking pictures just as you did to kill time while waiting for people to clear out of an area.  At least that way I don't look like some idiot standing around suspiciously!
