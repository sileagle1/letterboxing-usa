<br/>
thanks for the thoughts.  I think many of our concerns haven't been with<br/>
people letting it be know that they found or enjoyed our boxes.  I think<br/>
most of us love hearing that.  My concerns are with inadvertent spoiling of<br/>
clues or inaccurate "MIA" reports.<br/>
<br/>
I love hearing about people's adventures since A-Bear and I are the only ID<br/>
boxers for now.  I think it is great to discuss things on list if it is done<br/>
carefully, but finding a set database that contains just information like<br/>
"missing" when that may not be true may too easily dissuade others from<br/>
seeking great boxes.<br/>
<br/>
happy hunting!<br/>

<br/>
It has been incorrectly assumed that because folks don't want their <br/>
boxes listed in the database that they do not want to hear reports on <br/>
them.  In the majority of cases, nothing could be further from the <br/>
truth.  I love to hear reports on my boxes, and appreciate when <br/>
finders e-mail me with their successes (and non-successes).  This is <br/>
how I keep tabs on my boxes and keep up-to-date status information on <br/>
each box on the clue page.  I am fortunate to be in Michigan where <br/>
the majority of boxers don't even read the Yahoo list, so the logical <br/>
way to report they have found a box is via e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
It has also been incorrectly assumed that because some folks have <br/>
voiced dislike of sitreps that they do not want to hear about boxing <br/>
adventures.  I love reading fun and interesting stories such as those <br/>
reported by BeMa (and others).  The concern is reports that reveal <br/>
specifics about boxes and give away information that the seeker <br/>
intended to be part of the challenge and/or reward of finding the <br/>
box.  And then there are the reports that are just lists of boxes <br/>
found which seem that they would have been more effectively sent to <br/>
the placer.<br/>
<br/>
It also concerns me that when people report their box finds to the <br/>
list, that they are assuming this serves as notification to the box <br/>
placer.  Of course nobody is under any obligation to report a box <br/>
find to the placer, but many do ask to be notified via e-mail.  In <br/>
the past it wasn't always obvious how to get in touch with the <br/>
placer, so box finds were sometimes posted to the list hoping they <br/>
would see them there.  The new LbNA site makes it possible to e-mail <br/>
any box placer.  Posting to the list is not the same thing, as many <br/>
people do not read the list.<br/>
<br/>
It also has been thrown out a few times that perhaps the elders could <br/>
teach the newer members.  I believe that most of those clinging to <br/>
tradition have been very active in organizing events and workshops <br/>
for the letterboxing community as a whole.  Several also have web <br/>
sites that give a wealth of information and links to letterboxing <br/>
information.  But making the information and instruction available is <br/>
only half of it...  people still need to take advantage of the <br/>
learning tools that are presented.  And most of all, need to <br/>
understand that as with so many other things in life, the best <br/>
teacher is experience.<br/>
<br/>
This post is not meant as a flame to anyone and please do not flame <br/>
me back either on list or via personal e-mail.  I am tired of the <br/>
same people who are saying that we must respect people's opinions and <br/>
get past the negativity sending me e-mail that is negative and <br/>
disrespectful.   <br/>
<br/>
I think this thing has gone round and round and been beaten <br/>
completely to death.  I for one, will agree to disagree because the <br/>
back and forth is no fun and certainly fits nowhere into the <br/>
reasoning of why I letterbox.<br/>
