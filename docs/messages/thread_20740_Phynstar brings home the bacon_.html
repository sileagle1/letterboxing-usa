Sorry, you knew that was coming, though... Pink Pig is the winner of <br/>
the Thumbin' Critters Hitchhiker Race! Today, October 17, 2004, <br/>
Phynstar carried Pink Pig through the final leg of the journey to the <br/>
finish line. She travelled by plane, train, and automobiles to arrive <br/>
in just under 3 months. The other drivers who helped carry Pink Pig <br/>
to victory were Periwinkle, Liz, moderndulcinea, Amanda from Seattle, <br/>
DoubleSaj &amp; Old Blue, Princess Lea, and the Boxing Bee Bunch! (Anyone <br/>
left out of this list, I'll contact you if I see your name in the <br/>
logbook!) Thanks everybody for creating a champion, and I'll be in <br/>
touch soon!<br/>
<br/>
And don't forget - the other racers still want to cross the finish <br/>
line, and there are still prizes to be had for those that do!<br/>
<br/>
Now that Pink Pig has won, she will enjoy a short vacation partying <br/>
in New York before heading out west to retire in style with her <br/>
winnings... And as for Phynstar, guess what she had for dinner <br/>
tonight!  -Q http://hitchhikerrace.blogspot.com/<br/>
