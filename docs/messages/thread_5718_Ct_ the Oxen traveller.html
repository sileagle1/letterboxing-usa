it. There is only a 4-5  day window when the box will be available. I <br/>
will post rain delays and  news of trail bail outs due to thunder <br/>
storms or other problems here as soon as I can. The basic plan is <br/>
this.  2002 is the Town of Mansfield , Ct. 300 th anniversary. Each <br/>
neighborhood was assigned a chairman to plan a event for that <br/>
neighborhood. I am in charge of Chestnut Hill section of town. <br/>
Chestnut Hill is mostly our large dairy farm. So ooooo... my idea was <br/>
to commemorate our family coming here to this land in 1772 and <br/>
starting the farm  which has grown and prospered since. My son and <br/>
his young uncle will be driving their 4-H oxen teams across eastern <br/>
Ct. We will be using the rail trail as it is safest for the boys and <br/>
oxen. Now you see why I plan to bail out if it gets nasty. I have no <br/>
desire to chase oxen throught the Ct. countryside in a storm! We will <br/>
pass many of Chucks rail boxes and get them if we can  we will be <br/>
posting some new boxes we leave behind and we will carry the once in <br/>
a lifetime traveller. It is over 25 miles  journey we plan to take 4-<br/>
5days to finish trucking home at night to rest the boys oxen and <br/>
Moms. I have attached ( sorry those that hate them but the schedule <br/>
is going many places so I did it in word) our schedule but I may <br/>
ammend it as the weekend weather forecast becomes more clear. I don't <br/>
mind a little rain just no thunder .  Hope you can catch us on the <br/>
trail , at  a crossroad or in Goodwin forest park where we plan one <br/>
of our picnics. This is a adventure extroidinair for boys age 8 and <br/>
13 and their Moms . We represent the  9th and tenth generation on the <br/>
farm. We hope a couple of the little ones of the 11 th generation <br/>
will join us at the end for the walk up the road to the farm. Please <br/>
if your coming don't forget to pull clues for Got Milk thats where we <br/>
will end.    Leader of the pack , the Cowboy and the Sherriff  ( I <br/>
can't figure how to attach it here so I will send a second notice <br/>
from my email with the schedule . Thanks all  Carol <br/>
