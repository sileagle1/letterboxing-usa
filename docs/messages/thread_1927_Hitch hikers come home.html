months ago with a special dedication has a request on the last page <br/>
to send it home and recieve a little letterboxing suprise in return. <br/>
That way we can give the well travelled book to the person it was <br/>
dedicated to as a momento. As far as I know this  one is not even on <br/>
the road yet. Another recently released was purchased at the stamp <br/>
shop during the winter gathering and when and if you see Ready Freddy <br/>
( named by Timmy) you will understand he had to be on the road.<br/>
<br/>
 To Deb who may still be holding him, would you add my address to the <br/>
back page and a note to send him home when full I'll swap a letterbox <br/>
treasure for his return. <br/>
<br/>
   It's school vacation so be on the lookout for new boxes my <br/>
backpack is ready I'm planning some new ones that I hope all will <br/>
enjoy. I have a mystery, a historical, a indoor , and a couple <br/>
regulars ready to hit the trail. I couldn't wait for Fridays last <br/>
bell at school I think I was out the door before the kids in <br/>
anticipation of a letterboxing week!   Carol - YEEEAAAHHH ! VACATION!<br/>
