topic dies a just and quick death...<br/>
<br/>
 We were going to place our first letterboxes this<br/>
weekend. After reading through all of this, I have to<br/>
say I am a little bewildered about what sort of<br/>
statement to put at the end of the clues I write. Is<br/>
the inclusion of a link to the LBNA site's warning<br/>
good enough, or do I now need to get GPS numbers and<br/>
have a lawyer write a liability waiver for me?<br/>
<br/>
 I'm not being completely facetious here... I'd love<br/>
to place these boxes and have people enjoy some of the<br/>
best parks in the SF Bay region, but I'm somewhat<br/>
reluctant to if I'll be sued by someone who gets a<br/>
splinter from a redwood tree or has a run-in with an<br/>
irate bluejay. <br/>
<br/>
 Are there any serious suggestions on how I should<br/>
word the warnings on my clues, or is there anyone on<br/>
this list who would like to test the clues I write to<br/>
find the boxes, and then give me suggestions on how to<br/>
reword them before I submit them to the site? Is that<br/>
necessary, or a good idea, do you think?<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks all for your patience! And my apologies to the<br/>
list-keeper for continuing the topic, but these are<br/>
serious and real concerns for me now. <br/>

As in all things, use common sense.  I have been on this list since its<br/>
inception, and the version before, and the version before that.<br/>
Letterboxing in this country has gone through some interesting changes and<br/>
transformations along the way.  We have tried our best to destroy it from<br/>
within, without and every other way.  I suspect whatever lawsuits develop<br/>
along the way, it will continue in some fashion.  "Forester" has raised a<br/>
valid enough concern that it has given us all some pause.  I think his<br/>
approach was a little too "gloom and doom," and I also think his remarks<br/>
were colored by his recent experience in the woods.  I don't think it merits<br/>
a wholesale overhaul of our individual clue methodology.<br/>
<br/>
Let your conscience be your guide....   and don't forget a link to the<br/>
waiver.<br/>
