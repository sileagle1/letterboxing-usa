                    <div class="plaintext-content">I (Steve) had to run up to East Greenwich and get measured for a tux <br/>
today. On the way home I took a little side trip and found Rhode <br/>
Island Directions LB -- right where I thought it was. After 4 years <br/>
at URI I had driven that road a jillion times!<br/>
<br/>
Also found the Inn of the End and dropped someone off. Picked up the <br/>
Black Sheep of the Family HH.  He'll be making his wooly presence <br/>
felt sometime soon...perhaps next Saturday. We'll travelled little <br/>
guy too... since 10/2000!!!<br/>
<br/>
Did the Pine Barrens of RI letterbox too. What an odd place! I saw 4 <br/>
or 5 of the HUGEST deer in the "beach" area before feeding the local <br/>
mosquito population while stamping in. The box itself had been <br/>
dragged from hiding about 10 feet into the open. It's funny how weird <br/>
a tupperware box in the middle of the forest floor looks. While <br/>
stamping, It started to thunderstorm and downpour. A loooong hike <br/>
back in the torential rain.  I was soaked, miserable, and hungry so <br/>
there was no dancing as I got in the car and drove back home : (<br/>
<br/>
Another day, another mystery : )<br/>
