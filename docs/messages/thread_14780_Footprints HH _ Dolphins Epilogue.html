<br/>
I took Danny down to Dolphins, which is still in good shape in spite of being discovered by non-boxers.  :-)  We found the site for the epilogue and left no stone unturned (they were all turned over anyway at some point before), but found no box.  It makes me sad that another box, especially a Kurdziel box, has gone missing.  Can Trish confirm?  I look all over hoping to find that whoever has been swiggin' beers and lighting fires there maybe just tossed it aside.  No luck.  BUt Danny found an empty, unmarked ziplock nearby.  I'm sure we were looking in the right place, as were you, WW.<br/>

Wish I could meet you at Johnston, but I can't bunk.  Maybe the kids would like the Scituate puzzle, too?<br/>
