  Lavenia come back on board now.  her Ma shouted. There is a big storm brewing and youll git the sniffels iffin you git wet. Lavenia ran to the canal boat like her mama told her but she forgot her box of school supplies. There was a notebook, a pencil and an eraser. Ma, they will wash down the canal if I dont go back out and get them Lavenia pleaded.  No, this wind is too strong, it is even twisting some of these old trees. You might get blown down the canal and get caught in one of them and the Captain and your Pa would have to go looking fer ya. Mamie, her Ma answered.  When the storm was over, Buggs Cross, Lavenias Pa said its time to shove off and they left without looking  for the box of supplies. But Pa, I know it is right there, let me just run down the path and look. Itll only take a minute. I wont go pass the creek. Please. begged Lavenia.  Well have time to look for it on the trip back down when we go thru Lock 29 and yer ma can visit the misses at the Catoctin Lock House consoled the Captain. But they never did and years later Lavenias parents moved into the Lock House and Lavenia forgot all about the box. I bet it is still there. Why dont you see if you can find it and visit the new lockmaster.<br/>
