&gt; As far as we know this is the first letterbox in Erie county ... <br/>
the only one at the present time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Placed in Erie County, PA <br/>
&gt; by the Jackson Family on 8/26/02<br/>
&gt; Nearest City - Erie<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Just an addition to the subject line ... wanted to make sure it <br/>
was known that this is a new stamp in PA. This was our first attempt <br/>
at hiding a letterbox. We only started "Hunting" one week ago while <br/>
visiting friends and family in CT. We were so excited to get back <br/>
home and share our adventure with friends ... only to find that there <br/>
are no letterboxes close by. <br/>
<br/>
I sure hope this gets things started in Erie county ... if not I may <br/>
have to find a few more hiding places.<br/>
