to Steve for coordinating and for boiling the yummy crawfish.  <br/>

transplants from WA can testify that they are delicious!)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Cami for procuring and bringing the awesome event boxes.  <br/>
I spent most of my time at the event admiring journals with <br/>
wonderful stamps from just about every name I've seen in 3 months on <br/>
this list. That was a very special surprise!  <br/>
<br/>
And Steve's event stamp is on a par with any I've seen.  I truly <br/>
think that if more people could see Steve's work, he'd have a <br/>
reputation as a carver equal to any in the country!  <br/>
<br/>
We even made a mini-poster - I'll upload a photo as soon as I get my <br/>
digital camera back from where I accidently left it.<br/>
<br/>
I think the number of boxers in this area has more than doubled in <br/>
the last 6 months and we might see even more growth in the next 12 <br/>
months.  Y'all come!<br/>

them, and they were sooo good. I was a little put off by there live-<br/>
at-boiling appearance, but I've eaten dog so I guess I shouldn't be <br/>
so picky.Thanks Steve for the wonderful introduction to Lousiana <br/>
food! <br/>
<br/>
And yes, the event stamp was beautiful. Steve is an amazing artist <br/>
and you all (y'all?) should get on down here to find his boxes.<br/>
<br/>
We even got T-shirts with a very apt poem.<br/>
