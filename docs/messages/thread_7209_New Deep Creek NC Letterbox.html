<br/>
We just placed our first box. Here's the info:<br/>
<br/>
The Allens' Deep Creek Letterbox<br/>
<br/>
This box is located in Deep Creek Campground in the<br/>
Great Smoky Mountains National Park next to Bryson<br/>
City, NC, in Swain County. It was placed August 21,<br/>
2002.<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park at the entrance to Deep Creek<br/>
Campground. There is a private business in Bryson City<br/>
called Creekside Tubing right at the entrance. By the<br/>
way, they have great food and service if you go when<br/>
they're open, from May 31 through Labor Day. Pick a<br/>
tube up here too ($2-$3) so you can tube down Deep<br/>
Creek after your find.<br/>
<br/>
Drive straight through and don't turn right to go to<br/>
the tenting area, unless you want to tent. The price<br/>
is $14...great deal, friendly camp host, clean<br/>
bathrooms, but frequent bear visitation. (Leave all<br/>
food, soap, &amp; shampoo in your car overnight and throw<br/>
all trash in the dumpster!)<br/>
<br/>
You will eventually come to a parking lot. Not the big<br/>
one beside the creek on your right, but the one<br/>
further up on your left. You'll know if you've gone<br/>
too far because you will come to a gate you can't pass<br/>
with a car. It's a path used by tubers, hikers, and<br/>
joggers.<br/>
<br/>
The parking lot you find will have a 0.3 mile trail to<br/>
Juney Whank Falls leading off the back of it. Follow<br/>
the signs until you come to the falls and a log<br/>
bridge. And I do mean a log bridge...one log. In case<br/>
you ended up at the falls and bridge using a different<br/>
route, look at it this way - if you are looking at the<br/>
front of the bridge, you need to be on the left side<br/>
end. So, standing at that end, look to your far right<br/>
at a group of large rocks just right for sitting.<br/>
Climb over the rocks and to your near left, just a few<br/>
feet down the slope, will be a rock leaning against the base of<br/>
a tree, with the top of it embedded in the tree. Look<br/>
behind this rock and under some more and you should<br/>
find the Deep Creek Letterbox. We carved this stamp<br/>
around the fire while camping here.<br/>
<br/>
***This is a much traveled trail. Be careful to find<br/>
and hide the box as secretly as possible.***<br/>
<br/>
Stay awhile and visit the park. Many families,<br/>
including ours, have made it a tradition to return<br/>
each year. It's great for camping, tubing, picnicking,<br/>
hiking, and ranger talks. A couple of last<br/>
warnings...when tubing, always wear water or tennis<br/>
shoes to fend off rocks and peruse all sunny rocks as<br/>
you go down...they make great tanning beds for snakes.<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun!<br/>
