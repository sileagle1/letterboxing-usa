                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, everyone. I'm going to be on a road trip next week, and in the <br/>
course of my travels I'm going to be passing through a handful of <br/>
states on my way home. I'd like to make the trip a letterboxing tour <br/>
by stopping in each state I pass through for a stamp or two.<br/>
<br/>
So here's the thing--I don't know a group of these states all that <br/>
well, and the letterboxing.org site is rather cumbersome if one <br/>
doesn't know the exact location of the stamps in relation to, say, <br/>
the highway. The lists of counties and towns makes for a long trial-<br/>
and-error process with online map sites to work out the feasibility <br/>
of visiting any given box.<br/>
<br/>
So I'd like to ask a two-part question:<br/>
<br/>
1. Can anyone recommend stamps (either of their own placement or <br/>
someone else's) in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, or Illinois <br/>
that are within a few miles of I-80? I don't mind doing a bit of <br/>
hiking once I'm out of the car, but I'd hate to add hours of extra <br/>
driving to what is already going to be a 1200-mile trip.<br/>
<br/>
2. Has anyone ever produced (or considered producing) an online <br/>
catalogue of road-trip-friendly letterbox lists? Organized, for <br/>
example, by highway or route nearest to the box? Or do people feel <br/>
this would not be properly in the questing spirit of the letterbox <br/>
hunt?<br/>

Tho I understand others might not.<br/>

<br/>
Can't help you much with the I-80 boxes, but I can tell you that people are<br/>
usually quite willing to respond to these requests.    As for the second<br/>
part of your question, Mark Pepe, I believe, has compiled a list of the 1-95<br/>
accessible boxes.<br/>
