<p>Keystone Bridge Letterbox</p>

<p>Take Route 202 to New Salem and look for the blinking light at the junction 
of Rte. 202 and Rte. 122. Turn onto Route 122 South and proceed for about 2/10â€™s 
of a mile. Look on the right for the green sign indicating Quabbin Gate 30 and 
park in the small lot beside the gate. Cross over the metal bar and walk along 
the path (which was at one time a road leading to one of the small towns that 
was flooded to create the Quabbin Reservoir) for a short distance. About the 
time that you hear the river look to your left and find a wooden post with a 
slanted top. Right after that is a small set of stairs that lead to the water. 
The keystone bridge itself is on your right. There will be a fallen log pointing 
to the river. Walk toward the log, cross over it to the left and take about 5 
steps along the stream bank. On your left you will see a crop of rocks. Take 10 
steps along the base of the rocks and look for a loose stone that is the "key 
stone" to the Keystone Bridge Letterbox.</p>
