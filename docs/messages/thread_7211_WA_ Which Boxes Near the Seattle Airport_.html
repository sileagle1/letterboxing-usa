Sigh. I'm thinking I just don't have enough time, but I've never been <br/>

If you are going to be here anytime between 3pm-8pm and if there is a baseball (or football) game scheduled the same day, forget your 1 hour. (: It will be more like 1 minute. (:  <br/>
<br/>
The bus system does run all over the county, and connects to other county transit systems. However, if you are going to take a bus to letterbox, you are pretty much doomed..  The bus will take forever to get you anywhere, and never mind the time it will take to get back. (:  <br/>

<br/>
It'll take you 20-30 minutes just to get out of the airport.  Assuming you<br/>
return 2hrs before your departure - that leaves precious little time to<br/>
letterbox.  You could easily get tangled up in a traffic jam that'll really<br/>
mess up your plans.<br/>
<br/>
I'd really recommend against it - unless you want to experience some of the<br/>
worst traffic on the West Coast.<br/>

Given the current SeaTac Airport, it is not practical to get away <br/>
with only 3 hours.<br/>
<br/>
You don't say if this is while you are going to or returning from <br/>
Alaska.  If while going, you might arrange a longer (18-24 hour) <br/>
layover on the return, that would cause to have a Seattle Area <br/>
Letterbox Gathering to show you why you should move out here!<br/>

It's on the flight to Alaska. I only have like an hour's layover on <br/>
the flight home. Sigh. Guess I'll just have to content myself with <br/>
some honest-to-goodness, real Seattle coffee!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone who responded for your advice.<br/>
<br/>
And if you're in Juneau, Wrangell, and Ketchikan, Alaska, check out <br/>
the boxes I plan to plant in these places!<br/>
