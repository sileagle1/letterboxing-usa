I think it is wonderful that you have adopted that letterbox! Just like any <br/>
adoption, it is done out of generosity and goodwill, and like any adoption you <br/>
should feel free to make it your own. It is nice, but not required, if you <br/>
have a little blurb giving credit to the original author and offering to return <br/>
the box to their safekeeping the instant they ask. It is possible that the <br/>
original planter may come snarling back at you someday with a "how dare you?" <br/>
flame, but I think most planters (and finders) will recognize your work as the act <br/>
of kindness that it really is and be thankful.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you can reclue and recarve as you see the need.<br/>
<br/>
Cock O' The Trail does raise bigger questions though: should we encourage <br/>
adoptions at all? Should there be guidelines? What was the big deal with <br/>
Unclaimed boxes anyway?<br/>
