<div>During our last letterboxing outing in SoCal we 
came upon a herd of sheep grazing in the fields of Orange Co. When we approached 
the herd, a couple of Basque sheep herders came up to us  waving their 
arms, and yelling something like" YOU BE GONE". We tried to back out of the area 
but they kept following us and repeating"YOU BE GONE", "YOU BE GONE".Finally we 
stopped and tried to communicate in our poor Spanish,horrible French and 
any other language we felt they might speak, but to no avail. They just kept 
scratching their heads and (not now yelling at least) saying "you be gone". Well 
communication was a success, intelligence finally came to the fore, the light 
went on and we joined their search party. Unfortunately the search was 
unsuccessful, so when you are letterboxing in SoCal keep your eye out for the 
missing sheep"Ewe Be Gone".  </div>
