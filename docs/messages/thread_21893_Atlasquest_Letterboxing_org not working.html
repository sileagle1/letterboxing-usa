Hi Music Woman,<br/>
Here is something that I found after LBNA switched over. If I get <br/>
impatient and click on AQ or LBNA before my startup page is finished <br/>
loading then I too get an error.I then have to hit the Back button, <br/>
wait to finish loading then hit AQ or LBNA. I have very slooooow dial <br/>
up so this may not be the same problem you are experiencing.<br/>

Not as far as I know. They both seem to work just fine for me, and<br/>
there haven't been any errors recorded on Atlas Quest for several days<br/>
now.<br/>
