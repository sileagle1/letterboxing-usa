<br/>
Don't worry :-)  No one here is trying to make rules for the group.  <br/>
The problem is that the question comes up alot, so some people may <br/>
be interested in what other people are thinking about this, and it<br/>
can go in the FAQ and not keep coming up again and again.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone of course does what they want in their clues, but you have <br/>
to be careful when looking for someone else's boxes.  The poll is<br/>
like "asking the audience" if your not sure :-).  IMO, the best <br/>
strategy on this issue is to write clues that make the question moot.<br/>
<br/>

I don't think anyone expects everyone to agree as a group, but it <br/>
would be helpful if you clarified that you consider a pace to be 2 <br/>
steps when writing clues. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I missed the poll Bruce but I must agree with you and my upbringing as a scout as well. The pace, as I was taught is measured by two footfalls. Everyone's pace is different. My clues will not use paces to avoid confusion. Feet will be used instead. Therefore, when you know how many feet you must travel, you can convert to how many of your paces it would take to complete the traverse. The pace as I was taught, is used to make it easier when orienteering especially when bushwacking. If steps are used in "directions" to find something (especially those long 90 step clues, TC) depending on how long a persons legs are to another persons legs can vary. Oh well, there's my input. I shall continue with my vacation now.<br/>
