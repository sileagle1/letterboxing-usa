<br/>
I found out about letterboxing at a Girl Scout event.  We needed to actually take the girls out to find a letterbox after the event to earn the patch, so that inspired me to keep going after the event.  Then I convinced a friend whom I regularly went butterflying with to give it a try--on our first butterfly hike of 2007, we found our first letterbox and the butterfly we were looking for!  Leps and Letterboxing was born!  I've now planted my first few boxes and am closing in on 100 finds.   And that's my nutshell version...<br/>

<br/>
My name is BJ and I am actually fairly new to letter boxing. I'm<br/>
hooked now tho. I read an article in the Daily newspaper some months<br/>
ago about two locals who plant and find letterboxes. I did some<br/>
research after reading the article and found that its a wonderful<br/>
hobby. So My boyfriend and me got our stamps together and headed out<br/>
for an easy walk to start. Actually the box we first found was Frosty<br/>
2007 in Yoe, Pa. We love the out doors and I believe the family time<br/>
is a great thing for us. Its a very healthy and happy time :) Dunno if<br/>
that  helps but hope your article turns out well.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the hunt! <br/>
BJ<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm a traditional crafter, started with crocheting as a child, advanced <br/>
to assorted needle crafts, then assorted other crafts... and over the <br/>
last several years became mostly a rubberstamp and papercraft person.  <br/>
At my rubberstamp club meeting our president mentioned an article in a <br/>
rubberstamping magazine about Letterboxing, and briefly explained what <br/>
it was.  And wouldn't it be great if our club made a letterbox and hid <br/>
it for other rubberstampers to find?  <br/>
<br/>
Well, so far the club president and i are the only 2 who have delved <br/>
into this.  She has been boxing and found a few boxes.  I on the other <br/>
hand fell completely into the addiction.  We still don't have the club <br/>
box designed, planted etc.  But we will do it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm still a newbie. But i love this hobby. <br/>
<br/>
as to my reasonings:<br/>
it's fun, thrill of the hunt and then the reward of the find.<br/>
there are some amazing stamps out there.<br/>
I need the exercise<br/>
I enjoy nature and i get to take wonderful pictures along the way.<br/>
I like going to new interesting places<br/>
I like puzzles and some of the clues are just that, puzzles.<br/>
Carving stamps is fun <br/>
The people i have met are wonderful!<br/>
<br/>
advice to people who are thinking of starting:<br/>
take the time to research the websites. there is a TON of information <br/>
out there. check the new boxer boards and the files with saved info. <br/>
Then ask questions.  Someone will help you.<br/>
<br/>
Learn about traditional boxes first, then branch out into whatever <br/>
other types of boxes you are interested in. Don't think you have to do <br/>
it all. <br/>
<br/>
You can do urban boxes if you don't like the nature hikes.<br/>
<br/>
Try carving. It's easier than you think. remember your first attempts <br/>
at other types of crafts, and how you improved with them.  The same <br/>
thing will happen here, you will improve.<br/>
<br/>
Do not fear going to an event. You will get a lot of help and <br/>
encouragement. You will be exhausted, and overwhelmed, but you will <br/>
have fun. But, focus on meeting the people and learning; not on trying <br/>
to find all the stamps.  and if the event offers a "cootie shot" get <br/>
it. You can do them the next time, or even remove you "anti cootie" <br/>
sticker at the end of the meet and get a couple if you want to. And if <br/>
you get some cooties you don't want to deal with, find someone who will <br/>
take them ( kids are usually willing to do this.  some events have a <br/>
place you can put unwanted cooties.)<br/>
<br/>
Remember three main concepts:<br/>
Respect the environment - don't destroy anything to get to a box.<br/>
Be safe - do not put yourself at risk to get a box.  <br/>
The boxes are meant to be a secret thing.  Find and replace with sealth <br/>
if you are in an area where others may see you. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, i wish i had started in this years ago when my <br/>
daughter was younger.  It's a wonderful hobby that the whole family can <br/>
participate in.  And, you can actually teach/learn some interesting <br/>
things. Oh, if you are taking a long roadtrip, there is probably a box <br/>
along the way that you can use to break up the long drive time. <br/>
<br/>
Other than that, my advice is to just have fun and enjoy it.<br/>

I poke a couple holes in the package and let them age for a few months. <br/>
I consider them 'done' when they crunch!!!<br/>
The Just Born/Fan Club websites indicate 25% like them 'stale'.  But <br/>
that includes tough.  they must crunch! for me. <br/>

Check out the Chicago Tribune website for pics of Peeps dioramas <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's lots of how-to info at http://www.letterboxing.org/, but the best way<br/>
to find out about letterboxing is to give it a try for yourself.  The above URL<br/>
(click on the book) and http://www.atlasquest.com/ have clues listed by<br/>
location, pick out a few that look easy and go see for yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
If you take along ink, a pen or pencil, and some paper you can get the whole<br/>
experience -- look through the logbook to see who else has been there, "stamp<br/>
in" with a thumb print or just leave a little message, and take home an image<br/>
of the stamp that's in the box -- some of these are really impressive.  Note<br/>
that the easier a box is to get to, the greater the risk of a non-boxer having<br/>
found and removed it, so take care not to be seen finding them and don't be<br/>
disappointed if it takes a few tries to actually get one.  <br/>
<br/>
I bet if you said where you are, you could find someone reasonably nearby who<br/>
would take you along on a hunt (some areas have more boxers, and boxes, than<br/>
others but it's worth a try).  I'm still pretty new at it, but if you happen to<br/>
be in the Puget Sound/S.W. Wash. area....  Most areas have regional lists, too.<br/>
<br/>
There's also the Newboxers list you can hang out on (you can join it through<br/>
the LBNA site but I forget exactly where the link is -- somewhere among the<br/>
"how to" stuff).<br/>
<br/>
For myself, I'm in it for the visuals -- many many pretty stamps, plus<br/>
beautiful places for my camera and the occasional glimpse of wildlife to make<br/>
me feel special.  And yeah, it's like a treasure hunt, but so's digging<br/>
potatoes (which is great fun too, but only if you're not doing it all day). <br/>
Plus boxing gives me somewhere to bike TO; it's no fun just to go around and<br/>
around the block.<br/>
<br/>
The stamp carving is fun, too; I'm not really ready to place a box yet (maybe<br/>
this summer, if all works out) but I like to make little tiny stamps for my<br/>
logbook representing the different critters I see on my way to and from a box.<br/>
<br/>
If you'd like something wordier or some photos, feel free to drop me a line.<br/>

&gt; Hi! My name is Meghan and I've never been letter boxing.  I have a<br/>
&gt; little online 'zine called Pack Rat dedicated to crafts. I'm writing<br/>
&gt; an article on "Green" hobbies will be part of our April issue and I<br/>
&gt; was wondering if anyone would be willing to let me pick your brain<br/>
&gt; about letter boxing: why its so much fun, what drew you in, what keeps<br/>
&gt; you going, that kind of thing.  I'd really appreciate any help I could<br/>
&gt; get.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you,<br/>
