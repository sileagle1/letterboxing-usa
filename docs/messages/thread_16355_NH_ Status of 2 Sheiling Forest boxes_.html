<br/>
     Sue &amp; I spent a great foliage weekend in VT this past weekend <br/>
and ended up in Keene, NH to letterbox. The Otter Brook Dam letterbox <br/>
in Keene is alive and well.<br/>
<br/>
     We attempted the 2 Shieling Forest letterboxes [Shieling Forest <br/>
&amp; Cinco D'Emma Maija] in Petersborough, NH and really struck out on <br/>
both! I HATE when that happens :( <br/>
<br/>
    Has anyone seen or heard of these 2 letterboxes recently? I <br/>
noticed that they were initially placed in 1999 and 2000 and may not <br/>
have someone overseeing them. Let me know offlist if you have any <br/>
info on them.<br/>
<br/>
    For the rest of our weekend adventures and new status on our <br/>
letterboxes, visit our website. Thanks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    Have fun and get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

    I'm glad to hear that Otterbrook Dam has had some recent visitors.  We<br/>
camp in the Keene area several times a year, so we continue to plant new<br/>
boxes in the area.  We will be heading back that way in a couple of weeks<br/>
for the annual Pumpkin Festival, and would love to do some boxing while we<br/>
are up there.  Please e-mail me off list and let me know where I could find<br/>
the clues to the Valley Quest boxes you found.  We have the book, but it<br/>
does not include these two.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
