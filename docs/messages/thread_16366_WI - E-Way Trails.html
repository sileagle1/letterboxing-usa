The E-Way Trails box is resting with the Christmas Elves. It was wet<br/>
again, so we're drying everything, replacing bags, etc. We really<br/>
enjoyed this box and expect to return it next week.  It should be<br/>
ready for visitors on October 19th.<br/>

<br/>
We followed you around Jefferson County, WI on Sunday.  We checked <br/>
the Ft. Atkinson Riverwatch Box, but the site is under construction. <br/>
Despite the barriers and dire warnings of danger Golden Boy edged out <br/>
onto the railroad bridge, but couldn't find the box.  I guess we'll <br/>
have to label this box MIA.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting us know about E-Way Trails; I was sorta thinking <br/>
of taking a mid-week jaunt.<br/>
