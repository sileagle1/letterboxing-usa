planted 5/5/02<br/>
by Amanda from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
A rogue Tarheel fan has infiltrated the Duke University campus!  Your <br/>
mission is to find him before he inflicts untold damage upon the <br/>
Dookies. :-)  He was last seen lurking around the Duke Cross Country <br/>
trail, attempting to trip Duke Fans as they jogged by!!<br/>
<br/>
If you are going counter-clockwise around the trail...just past the <br/>
Faculty Club there is a white gate.  43 steps past the white gate on <br/>
your left is an abandoned stone fireplace.  Inside the fireplace is <br/>
the  Tarheel Letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Please be discreet!  This is a very busy trail...I was here on a <br/>
Sunday and the place was hopping!  <br/>
