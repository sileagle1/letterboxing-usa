Well this has happened to one of the LB's placed on top of Wittenberg<br/>
Mountain. It had been so cold* that the plastic box must have opened<br/>
under the stresses of the weather/snow/ice to allow the contents to be<br/>
soaked when checked out this past Spring. ..........  <br/>
<br/>
* or maybe it was OP (LB)  error....not closing the box when<br/>
found...........<br/>
<br/>
Mall boxes sound good to me........inside out of the weather....hmmm....<br/>

BTW   how many days till Spring????<br/>
