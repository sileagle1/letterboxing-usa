mix LOVES the outdoors.  She will be out in the yard all day, only <br/>
agreeing to come inside to poop on the rug and then scratching at the <br/>
door to go back<br/>
<br/>
I would say play with her indoors so that she considers that a "play" <br/>
area.  Also feed her on a regular schedule and make a point of taking <br/>
her for a walk or outside about 1/2 hour after she eats.  I'm sure <br/>
she'll understand how it works in no time. : )<br/>
<br/>
We take our great pyr with us letterboxing whenever we can - looks <br/>
like we'll be making him a stamp!  : )<br/>
