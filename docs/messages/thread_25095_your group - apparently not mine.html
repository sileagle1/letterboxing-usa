Maybe I am misunderstanding a lot here.  I joined this group as an extension of a new hobby.  I have many other hobbies and the groups that I belong to because of them are full of wonderful people who come together to share and enjoy their hobby together.  This group is full of pettieness and snobbery.  You all talk about the special people you meet doing letterboxing - are any of them here?  You talk about the need to be thick skinned.  Thick skin doesn't help when I have people sending me messages  - not brave enough to go through the group, but sent to my personal email - telling me that I don't belong here and should go somewhere else.  I have already decided that this group is not adding to my enjoyment of this hobby and I don't intend to stick around where I am not wanted.  The only thing I have found here is a bunch of hypocrits who talk about how hard it was to get started because there were so few of you and you were so spread out, but then run off anyone new who wasn't hand guided into the hobby who, with a little guidance and association, could help this grow.  Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed finding boxes with my family, but I don't intend to plan any of the gatherings because, as yet, I haven't seen but maybe one post from someone that makes me think I would like to meet them.  I will enjoy the artistry of the stamps and enjoy the hunt with my kids, but I have already told those that I encouraged to get involved with us that this group in particular is one to avoid.  I truely hope letterboxing continues in spite of the attitudes of this group, because one day all of the original generation is going to die off and the only ones left will be the ones who managed to endure the persecution of those who came before.  Instead of lamenting the fact that the media attention has brought new faces to a hobby you all love and doing your best to make us feel unwelcome and out of place, you could welcome us in.  Encourage meetings with the more seasoned to help us us get started.  I am sure there are letterboxers in just about every area.  Mentor those who are new to the hobby and teach them how to do it so, you don't lose boxes to newcomers who just don't understand or know.  Do your best to protect your hobby instead of circling the wagons and not letting anyone in.  I wish I could say that this group meant enough to me that I would miss it, but I apparently am still part of the "unwashed masses" that don't really belong.  For those of you that don't share the attitudes that have been expressed here in the last couple of weeks, I hope I meet you elsewhere and I am sorry that I don't have the endurance to hang out and be ridiculed and abused long enough to meet you.  <br/>

Good luck and good bye,<br/>
