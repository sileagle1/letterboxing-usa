<p>I'm delighted with the changes Choi is
making to our beloved letterboxing.org. He has been maintaining the
website for many years now, and with a burst of energy has re-written
much of the code and modernized the look of the pages. A few notes
for letterboxers who are interested:</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>LbNA was created in 1998 soon after the
Smithsonian Magazine article by Chris Granstrom introduced boxing to
America. Actually, though, there were letterboxers active here before
this landmark article, especially in VT with the Valley Quest program
(which continues today). 
</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Anyhooo, the LbNA website went through
several iterations over the years. I think it was first housed on 
AOL. The design was pretty cool, and it was set up so that
letterboxers would email their clues to a “webmaster” who would
manually create clue pages and maps in html and upload them to the
site one by one. This was fine while boxing was new, but as it caught
on a way for planters to create their own clues was needed.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>The website was redesigned in php and
moved to it's own url, letterboxing.org. People could finally upload
and edit/maintain their own clues. Letterboxing.org remained pretty
much the same for quite a while, with small tweaks and changes
keeping it going.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>Many folks were involved in this
process over the decade and a half since Chris' article in the
Smithsonian, and I'd like to write a little post about them when I'm
feeling creative. And of course AtlasQuest and the creativity of
Ryan, our favorite Green Tortuga, has promoted letterboxing
wonderfully.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>So if you get a chance, check out the
new letterboxing.org. I think you'll like it.</p>
<p><br/>
