<br/>
Team Weems' recently planted "Barrel of Monkeys" and "Holy Cow...What a <br/>
View!" letterboxes provided the perfect excuse for a hike along the Metacomet <br/>
Trail in north central Connecticut on this warm and sunny Sunday afternoon. <br/>
The autumn leaves are at peak color, and the view from atop the ridge near <br/>
the second box is indeed spectacular! The hike is invigorating (that first <br/>
hill is definitely steep!), the clues are pretty straightforward (and nicely <br/>
written!), and the two hand-carved stamps are quite whimsical. <br/>
<br/>
One caveat: if you decide to seek out these boxes, be prepared to use your <br/>
most expert covert operational skills when stamping in and returning the <br/>
boxes to their rightful places. This trail appears to be very popular, and <br/>
the amount of foot traffic along it when I was there was signficant. After I <br/>
found the "Barrel of Monkeys" letterbox, it must have taken at least 20 <br/>
minutes for the trail to be sufficiently clear of other hikers before I could <br/>
put the box back undetected! Anyone else have a similar experience elsewhere <br/>
in letterboxing country?<br/>
<br/>

Alan from Axtown<br/>
