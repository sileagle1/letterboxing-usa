As planned Kerry rode up to Lancaster PA for a round of brief visits <br/>
at the following campaign stops (1) Who's in County Park  - why Kerry <br/>
of course! then on to (2)Garden of  Five Senses where he delighted in <br/>
wiffing the various fragrant herbs near his campaign stop.  Leaving <br/>
Lancaster County Central Park he visited a series of three cemeteries <br/>
where tombstones memorialized some of those who had aided in the <br/>
Underground Railroad (3) Thaddeus Stevens, (4) Lydia Hamilton Smith <br/>
and (5) Rev. Henderson Davis.  He passed  on Rene's Tattoos, not <br/>
having any idea what that girl was all about or risking any scandal <br/>
with one so flighty!  After a failed attempt to find Buggy Box he <br/>
dined with the Red-Hat Box'rs in Mascot Park before making an <br/>
appearance in (6) Lucky Charms . . . and hopes with that final bit-o-<br/>
Irish his campaign trail will continue at as good a pace in <br/>
Delaware.  MizScarlet will  report his agenda there upon her return <br/>
in a couple of days.  KERRY: 4 personal `votes' and 6 campaign stops <br/>
in 2 states = 12 votes in less than 48 hrs.  13 if you count his <br/>
inaugural box. . . . Speaking of which, the Red-Hat Box'rs planted <br/>
their Inaugural PA Box in Lancaster County PA - so be sure to stamp <br/>
in it.  Kerry felt since he was involved in the plant he considered <br/>
it a conflict of interest to stamp in.   <br/>
