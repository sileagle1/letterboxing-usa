facet of my life.  So I planted a box close to my work place to give <br/>
me incentive to walk over there and check on it as often as possible<br/>

Coffee Break<br/>
Wakefield, Rhode Island<br/>
<br/>
Placed by: Laurette<br/>
When:  January 14, 2003<br/>
Level:  Easy 20 minute walk<br/>
<br/>
Driving Directions:  Take Rt. 108 to the intersection of Curtis <br/>
Corner Road.  Go east on Curtis Corner.  When you see the CC Middle <br/>
School (I don't work here), pull into the lot and follow the road <br/>
around the left of the building past the administration building.  <br/>
Park near the tennis courts.<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  Across the street from the tennis courts, a path runs east.  <br/>
Take it.  Follow the pink as it takes the 2nd right, over some <br/>
bridges, past lots of briars and through a stone wall.  At the, Y go <br/>
left.  35 paces from the Y, on the right side of the trail stands a <br/>
tree covered in briars, with a hollow at the bottom.  It's a good <br/>
place for a break.<br/>
