<br/>
Do you remember that great smelling shampoo that was available back <br/>
in the 70's, it was called "Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific!" Well, <br/>
it hasn't been available for almost 20 years now. But... good <br/>
news! I found out it is available again, but you can only buy it <br/>
online! <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I ordered some from an internet site in the USA.  Two big bottles.  I <br/>
always remembered the scent as a sweet smell, almost like cola soda.  <br/>
When received, of course I opened it ASAP!  To tell the truth, I was <br/>
disappointed alot.  The smell was a very flowery, almost laundry soap <br/>
flowery smell.  Not what I remember.  If you order, just be careful, <br/>
it may not be what you remember.    Karen<br/>
