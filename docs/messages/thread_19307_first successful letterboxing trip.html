was a good thing. I dragged the family to three different sites <br/>

in the Flyfisher's series and the box was in good condition. Since <br/>
we were in the area we also found Indian Resting Spot (that box was <br/>
also in good condition and in a great location!). Since we have a <br/>
two year old in our family we decided 2 boxes was a good start. The <br/>

found the box whose clues begin with the spitting turtles (good <br/>
condition). <br/>
Some things we learned along the way. (1) Our stamp is entirely too <br/>
big. (2) I need to work on my carving skills. (3) Biking is an <br/>
excellent way to get around between boxes (If the terrain allows).<br/>
Just my thoughts on this new hobby. I hope to locate a couple more <br/>
boxes this weekend and I am already working on ideas for placing <br/>
boxes. <br/>
Glad to have found the group.<br/>

Welcome!  It's real easy to get hooked, isn't it?  I stumbled upon <br/>
letterboxing about three weeks ago, spent one week figuring out and <br/>
carving my stamp and headed out to find my first box on June 19 -- <br/>
not more than 2 weeks ago.  Since then, I've got 14 boxes under my <br/>
belt, including 3 personal travelers, and the rest of my weekends <br/>
this summer are likely planned for hunting!<br/>
<br/>
If you have any quesitons about this hobby, a plethora of information <br/>
exists out there.  Start with the LbNA website FAQ <br/>
(http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html) as well as Silent Doug's <br/>
site (http://www.letterboxing.info/).  Other "getting started" <br/>
questions can be asked of the newboxers group here on Yahoo! <br/>
(http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/?yguid=189976828)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
