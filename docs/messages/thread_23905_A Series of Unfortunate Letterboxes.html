Letterboxes has been replaced AGAIN, so if you have<br/>
been waiting for me to replace it before trying the<br/>
sries, now would be the time, though I reccommend you<br/>
not try it at all, unless you enjoy misery.  If it<br/>
disappears AGAIN I may just pull the whole series - I<br/>
would rather go find boxes or place new ones than have<br/>
to keep treking up that miserable hill to replant the<br/>
same one over and over again.  It's in a new location<br/>
now, so if you ignore my reccommendation and go on the<br/>
hunt, make sure you bring the updated clues, but<br/>
really, don;t you have anything better to do with you<br/>
time?  I hear surgery is nice, or trips to the DMV.<br/>
<br/>
If you have already done the series, I am sorry to<br/>
hear it, but, I feel it incumbent upon me to mention<br/>
that, there now being a new (and final) book in the<br/>
Series of Unfortunate Events, there is a new bonus in<br/>
the Series of Unfortunate Letterboxes...<br/>
