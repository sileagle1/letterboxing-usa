<br/>
has anyone put letterboxes at rest stops on the interstates???....i think this would be great for letterboxers who are traveling who cant or wont get off the interstates in unfamiliar areas....<br/>
<br/>
i have a rest area scoped out and will take a friend and have them sit n the car and watch me to see if i look obvious or suspicious...if i do then ill need to regroup to "plant" my letterbox..<br/>
<br/>
just a thought<br/>

I planted one at a rest area in Oregon, although I've heard reports <br/>

I've been meaning to plant more of them at rest areas I've passed, <br/>

Of course you're going to look suspicious!  =)  The key in nabbing a <br/>
box like that is to have a ready-made excuse for anyone that <br/>
questions your "suspicious" activity.  Pick up trash--or pretend to <br/>
if there isn't any already on the ground.  Walk your dog--if you have <br/>
one.  (Best not to pretend to be walking a dog if you don't have one, <br/>
though, because that tends to make people nervous.)  <br/>
<br/>
Hiding the box along the edges of the rest area and away from the <br/>
main facilities helps to avoid suspicious eyes.  <br/>

yes for the stretching of the legs is a great reason to have one to hunt....<br/>
<br/>
the rest stop i have in mind has an access road behind and lots of weeds and some bushes for hiding....<br/>

i guess that means i cant walk my invisible dog that i bought at the carnival years ago??hhehehe..AND i dont have to carry a popper scooper for him either...;o<br/>

poison oak???....whats that???....dont know what that looks like OR poison ivy..so i guess i count myself lucky if i dont come out of the woods itching huh??<br/>

thats what made me think of rest stops...i was traveling across the U&gt;S&gt; at least twice a year and i thought that would have been a nice diversion along the interstates....<br/>
<br/>
and with just one letterbox listed for san antonio and its downtown a few near the town  with easier access would be nice....<br/>

Hmmm....  If you plan to spend much time letterboxing, it probably <br/>
would be a good idea to learn how to identify it.  I could describe <br/>
it, but that's not nearly as effective as looking at pictures or, <br/>
even better, have someone that can identify it point it out to you on <br/>
the trail so you can see exactly what it looks like 'in the buff' so-<br/>
to-speak.  =)<br/>

<br/>
I just checked the list today and found this message strand. I got <br/>
home last night from a road trip where I planted two microboxes at <br/>
reststops along I-95 in the Mid-Atlantic region (the "Pit Stop" <br/>
and "Gas-n-Go" at Maryland House and Chesapeake House). I will post <br/>
the clues as soon as I type them up. <br/>
<br/>
The box at Chesapeake House is in an area where people would <br/>
normally wander yet still well-hidden. I had a harder time finding a <br/>
good spot at Maryland House as the area is smaller and well-<br/>
manicured. (Also some posted security warnings kept me from some <br/>
tempting off-the-beaten track areas.) We'll see how long that one <br/>
lasts. If anyone has a better location, it could be moved or <br/>
replaced.<br/>
<br/>
I love the idea of having some diversions along the road. What about <br/>
boxes for each rest stop along the NJ Turnpike? We're moving to CA <br/>
in May, otherwise I'd volunteer!<br/>

<br/>
Doesn't matter if you can identify it--I know exactly what poison <br/>
oak, poison ivy &amp; poison sumac look like during their various stages <br/>
of the seasons...their oils get onto EVERYTHING and are nearly <br/>
impossible to get rid of!!!  The rest stop case of poison oak came <br/>
from the oils on their stems/leafless branches during the dormant <br/>
season--the stems were poking out of the base of the trees around <br/>
the edges of the rest area.  The more recent &amp; most hideous case of <br/>
poison oak came from our trip to the lake in Northern CA.  <br/>
Apparently, the oil was on sticks/other debris floating in the <br/>
lake... Didn't find out until 12 hours later and by then, it was too <br/>
late--since Tecnu (poison oak oil cleanser) only works during the <br/>
first two-eight hours of exposure!  UGH!  There's not enough <br/>
calamine lotion in the world...  Talk about a living hell!!!<br/>

&gt; Doesn't matter if you can identify it--I know exactly what poison <br/>
&gt; oak, poison ivy &amp; poison sumac look like during their various <br/>
stages <br/>
&gt; of the seasons...their oils get onto EVERYTHING and are nearly <br/>
&gt; impossible to get rid of!!! <br/>
<br/>
This is a good reason NOT to use things like "oatmeal baths" to <br/>
combate the poison oak rash. Soaking in the tub might make you feel <br/>
good for a little while, but it just tends to spread the oils around <br/>
and you start breaking out in a rash ALL over!! <br/>

<br/>
if your body is very sensitive (i. e. allergic) to the plant oils (urushiol, I believe), you may want to consider asking your family physician to either send you to an allergist, or give a shot to you him/herself.  There is a shot available that will desensitize you to the reaction.  I think that in order for it to be most effective, though, you have to get the shot in early spring.<br/>
<br/>
I have such an awful sensitivity to it that I have had to bandage up my legs. yuck.  The weeping is horrendous.  I forget about the preventative shot every year and just try avoiding the plant.  One of the most effective treatments I ever used was Ivy Dry.  It's a tannic acid solution that eases the itch reaction and dries up the weeping blisters.<br/>

  Doesn't matter if you can identify it--I know exactly what poison <br/>
  oak, poison ivy &amp; poison sumac look like during their various stages <br/>
  of the seasons...their oils get onto EVERYTHING and are nearly <br/>
  impossible to get rid of!!!  The rest stop case of poison oak came <br/>
  from the oils on their stems/leafless branches during the dormant <br/>
  season--the stems were poking out of the base of the trees around <br/>
  the edges of the rest area.  The more recent &amp; most hideous case of <br/>
  poison oak came from our trip to the lake in Northern CA.  <br/>
  Apparently, the oil was on sticks/other debris floating in the <br/>
  lake... Didn't find out until 12 hours later and by then, it was too <br/>
  late--since Tecnu (poison oak oil cleanser) only works during the <br/>
  first two-eight hours of exposure!  UGH!  There's not enough <br/>
  calamine lotion in the world...  Talk about a living hell!!!<br/>

about <br/>
&gt; boxes for each rest stop along the NJ Turnpike? We're moving to CA <br/>
&gt; in May, otherwise I'd volunteer!<br/>
<br/>
We'll think about that one. Actually we HAVE thought of that one. <br/>
The Turnpike stops are interesting in that each one is named after a <br/>
famous New Jerseyan. That could be worked into the clues, somehow, <br/>
maybe.<br/>

At least in Mass., some rest areas have a reputation for being less <br/>
