Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
This is just a friendly reminder that there are boxes in<br/>
North Western Pennsylvania! Not far from Pittsburgh, Cleveland,<br/>
or Buffalo!!!<br/>
<br/>
Somebody find my boxes!! and if anyone knows of any others near<br/>
here, please let me know!<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping these boxes will be on the LBNA map soon... until then<br/>
e-mail me for the directions to the others in the series or look on the <br/>
message board. They are posted there as well.<br/>
<br/>
Good Hunting -<br/>
Bryan Toy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No compass is needed for this box.<br/>
&gt;All the boxes in this series are easy to find.<br/>
&gt;The boxes in this series are Pennsylvania Wildlife.<br/>
&gt;All stamps are hand-carved.<br/>
&gt;You can find them all in the Allegheny National Forest.<br/>
&gt;I have tried to get people to some scenic locations with these.<br/>
&gt;The boxes in this series so far.....<br/>
&gt;Crayfish<br/>
&gt;Spring Peeper<br/>
&gt;Turkey Vulture<br/>
&gt;Porcupine<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Box 1 - Spring Peeper<br/>
&gt;This is the easiest.... It is on the NORTH COUNTRY TRAIL<br/>
&gt;Not more than 110 yards from the road.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Directions....<br/>
&gt;Find these things and you will be successful:<br/>
&gt;The border between Warren and Forest County.<br/>
&gt;The devil's highway.... the route number is 666.<br/>
&gt;State Road 2001 (Minister Road).<br/>
&gt;Head North towards Cherry Grove.<br/>
&gt;The North Country Trail Crosses the road about two miles up.<br/>
&gt;Walk East on the trail.<br/>
&gt;About 100 yards into the woods, there is a short logging road<br/>
&gt;   which bears to the right while the trail bears left.<br/>
&gt;Follow the logging road to the end (20 feet).<br/>
&gt;There is a big clearcut.<br/>
&gt;Look to your left and down.<br/>
&gt;There is a tree with an un-natural looking pile of rocks.<br/>
&gt;The rocks conceal a hollow in the base of the tree.<br/>
&gt;Bingo! Stamp me please!<br/>
&gt;Now wasnt than easy? The next one is a little harder, but not too much.<br/>

Your clues are on the updated PA map which you can access via www.letterboxing.org.  You may have to hit the reload button, or if you had the site bookmarked, you might need to re-create it since we changed servers.<br/>
<br/>
Send an e-mail to webmasters@letterboxing.org if you have any trouble.  <br/>
<br/>
To everyone else out there who may still be waiting for clues to get on the main map, we're very close to having everything up-to-date.  If we're hosting your clue and smething needs to be changed, again, send an e-mail to webmasters@letterboxing.org <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to a regularly updated letterboxing season!<br/>

Yes, it is off the beaten trail!<br/>
You will have to travel East from your primary route - Interstate 79.<br/>
Get on Rt. 6 West.... OR.... go west on RT 80 and then follow the <br/>
Allegheny River north from Mercer to Franklin and up (rt. 62)... <br/>
 HECK... Letterboxers hate superhighways! Take a great drive! A good <br/>
map of the Allegheny National Forest will help you find the boxes - <br/>
and you can probably get one at a highway visitor's center or even <br/>
online.<br/>
The drive through rural NY toward Buffalo from the Pennsylvania <br/>
forest is neat too ( stay on rt. 62). Check out the Kinsu Dam near <br/>
Warren, PA and the Roger Tory Peterson Museum in Jamestown, NY.<br/>
<br/>
GOOD HUNTING! You will probably be the first to find the boxes!<br/>
I can't wait to see your stamp!<br/>
