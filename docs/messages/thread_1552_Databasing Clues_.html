Maybe I'm a little thick here, but what's the material difference between
listing all the boxes on the map, or in a database? The website doesn't
have to include any more or less info than is present now. There should
be fields for Box Name, Box State, Box City, Difficulty, Clues, Special
notes, and Status (and any other fields that you all think are important).
<br/>The box placer can control which of these fields is filled in, and
what information goes into the field. If someone wants the clues to be
read from their website, then the link can be posted in the Clue field.
If the box placer doesn't want the city to be mentioned, then it can be
left blank. I think a database is a fine idea, especially since the box
count is expanding rapidly, and there's not enough room to show them all,
especially in those little tiny northeastern states. In the best of all
possible worlds, I see the box placers going to a form, located at the
LBNA website, where they can fill in all of the fields and post the new
box to the database themselves, thus eliminating some work for the webmasters.
I think the folks who maintain the site are doing a yeoman's job of it,
but surely it takes up alot of their precious time - time that they could
be spending carving stamps, or outside hunting or placing boxes.

I have offered to set this up on several occasions but haven't <br/>

the server running letterboxing.org has php and mysql it could be <br/>
done on the LBNA site.<br/>

<br/>
Geocaching.com, a sister sport/hobby/etc. uses a database. Because we use<br/>
specific coordinates in geocaching, we haven't had any real issues (clue<br/>
based caches are rare). We also were able to create our own basic culture,<br/>
which isn't as restrictive as letterboxing originally has been. I heard tell<br/>
that when letterboxing was introduced into the US, many of the Yankee<br/>
letterboxes were destroyed because of the culture of the game. It's a<br/>
secretive, quiet sport that seems to want to remain so. Not sure if this is<br/>
a minority view, especially in the US.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also have to say that it's an issue of relinquishing control. The group<br/>
of webmasters who have been maintaining the letterboxing.org site have done<br/>
a great job, and would be a bit defensive to move it over to a database, or<br/>
into someone elses' hands, which would most likely happen if it was moved<br/>
into another model.<br/>

However, the conversation did move into the use of the database as a<br/>
possible alternative to static web pages. At that time I suggested the use<br/>
of the Geocaching.com system, since it can be easily adapted to<br/>
letterboxing. There were some issues that came out of that specific<br/>

My email is elm at ao.net . There are many issues which need to be <br/>
discussed about how this could be implemented and the decisions would <br/>
determine how difficult it would be to set up. I suggest that we <br/>
consider a chat session (on egroups - I don't care) to discuss it and <br/>
invite anyone who is interested to participate. Most evenings are <br/>
good with me except weekends.<br/>

I don't know how much I'll pay attention to it, but anyone can drop by<br/>
if they want to chat letterboxing :-)<br/>
<br/>

I'm at jdewolf at icrsurvey.com , but please remember, I know nothing <br/>
about the technology.  I was simply raising this issue as a user.  <br/>
There are obviously several on this list who have the know-how and <br/>
perhaps still the willingness to set something like this up.<br/>
<br/>
Do feel free to e-mail me though...<br/>

&gt; &gt;John and Eric, would you mind sending me a note off-list so that I<br/>
&gt; &gt;can see your whole email address? Mine is drewclan at aol.com. I'd<br/>
&gt; &gt;love to talk with you and learn more about this technology. Thanks!<br/>

&gt; My email is elm at ao.net . There are many issues which need to be <br/>
&gt; discussed about how this could be implemented and the decisions <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; determine how difficult it would be to set up. I suggest that we <br/>
&gt; consider a chat session (on egroups - I don't care) to discuss it <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; invite anyone who is interested to participate. Most evenings are <br/>
&gt; good with me except weekends.<br/>
