What is a "Where's George" dollar?  We saw that dollar but didn't <br/>
look closely at it as it was DARK.  <br/>

&gt; We went boxing on Sunday and had the added fun of getting to our <br/>
&gt; 100th box!!  : D  Didn't even realize we were so close til I <br/>
stopped <br/>
&gt; to count yesterday morning.  With only three to go we just had to <br/>
go <br/>
&gt; reach it as part of Mom's Day. : D<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also - Two boxes at Lacy Woods park - 5133 and Year 2003 are both <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; good shape.  Even picked up a mapsurfer clue at one and a Where's <br/>
&gt; George dollar.  Trilogy at Hidden Pond Nature Center also alive <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; well.  <br/>

places it's been.<br/>
