Hopkins Memorial Tree Farm is owned and managed by Forests Forever, Inc. as a <br/>
research and demonstration forest.  It is a “working tree farm.”   This <br/>
140-acre woodland is newly open for general public access.  Of the nearly <br/>
three miles of trails, most are in pretty good shape, though some muddy spots <br/>
and encroaching brush provide occasional obstacles.  These letterboxes were <br/>
placed by staff of Forests Forever, Inc.  The three letterboxes at Hopkins <br/>
are not too far from a road or trail.  Letterbox locations are easy to get <br/>
to--it’s the rest of this woodland that offers greater challenge.  To learn <br/>
more about the Tree Farm and Forests Forever, go to www.forestsforever-or.org<br/>
.  Three good things about Hopkins Memorial Tree Farm: it's NEW, FREE and <br/>
CLOSE (to Portland, OR area), the rest you'll have to see for yourself.<br/>
