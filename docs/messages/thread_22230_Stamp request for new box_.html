<br/>
The success of partnering with some of you great carvers is exciting,<br/>
and I am eagerly developing new boxes to place!<br/>
<br/>
So far two of my four boxes contain stamps carved by others -- Willard<br/>
Clock (placed) and The Lady in Black (scheduled be placed in late<br/>
August).  Many thanks to Choi and Scarab, respectively, for their<br/>
magnificent artwork!<br/>
<br/>
I have another box I'd like to place, and thus another call for<br/>
someone willing to carve.<br/>
<br/>
The box is entitled "Walden" and will be placed at Walden Pond State<br/>
Reservation in Concord.  My research on LbNA and AQ has not turned up<br/>
a box in this area, so I'm claiming it!  (If someone knows of a box<br/>
there, please let me know as I wish not to duplicate).<br/>
<br/>
Any stamp dealing with serentity, contemplation, nature,<br/>
transcendentalism or, of course, Henry David Thoreau are welcome and<br/>
appreciated.  As always, carvers are fully credited on both the box's<br/>
clues published on my website and listed in LbNA and AQ as well as on<br/>
the box and journal itself.<br/>
<br/>
If you're interested, e-mail me -- and thanks in advance!<br/>

Not if I get there first! I have a box in the works for <br/>
this location....but if you get there first more power to <br/>
you! (there can always be two, but you said you had no <br/>
wish to duplicate)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Turtle.  There are no boxes listed in Concord in this location.<br/>
 A bunch at Great Meadows, but none at Walden Pond.  It's possible<br/>
that the box is listed in the wrong town.<br/>
<br/>
A search of the mystery boxes did turn up a box called Solitude which<br/>
could be at Walden Woods, but the link to the clues is broken.  I<br/>
didn't see any other boxes (by title) that appeared as though they<br/>
could be there.<br/>
<br/>
If you know of a box specifically, let me know offline.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Apparantly though, per Turtle there's already a box there, but as my<br/>
post said, none that I see listed in LbNA.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway ... seeing I can't carve, you'll get there before me I'm sure.<br/>
 I have to wait for some kind soul to come along and offer to carve<br/>
something!<br/>
