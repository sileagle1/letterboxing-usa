I really think that we out to see a possible database as complementary to <br/>
the web site.  I see them as a both/and rather than either/or  issue.  The <br/>
web page would link to the database and explain that many boxes are in the <br/>
database but that other sets of clues are in formats that don't necessarily <br/>
lend themselves to the database and thus are found here (another link).  I <br/>
imagine that with a bit of work the database could even become a layer of <br/>
infrastructure underpinning the GIS map of box locations currently <br/>
available--though that would not be a necessity.<br/>
<br/>
On another note. I need the map link on the Oklahoma map to read 9 boxes by <br/>
the dot at Bethany and linked to the following web site: <br/>
http://morpheus.snu.edu/~dwilliam.fs/geog1113/okcboxes.htm<br/>
<br/>
Also, the Ancient Pueblo dot should be at roughly lat=36.19  lon= -108.09 <br/>
(using the tiger system) rather than where it is currently.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Dennis! You're right: having a database automatically update <br/>
a GIS interface would be wonderful. We're not there yet at this small <br/>
level, but someday....<br/>
<br/>
I'm the one who updated Ancient Pueblo, and thought I got the <br/>
coordinates right the first time. I must have made a little typo <br/>
inputing them to the Tiger mapserver. I'll redo it this week. Sorry <br/>
it's off! Still, from the clues I thought it was a "mystery" box, <br/>
even though you gave us the coordinates. Would you rather it be under <br/>
a "?" than so graphically pinpointed on the map?<br/>
