* The moderators have been threatened with legal action.<br/>
* The moderators were informed that an attorney was contacted <br/>
_before_ certain posts were written and posted to the list.<br/>
* The moderators have been accused of committing a crime.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I have not committed any crimes recently.  Personally, <br/>
I don't want to deal with this.  I have no desire to distribute <br/>
pornography to anyone.  I do not distribute pornography.  Threatening <br/>
people with legal action is bad karma, and rarely achieves the <br/>
desired result.  In this case, I would counter sue for libel <br/>
or slander (whichever is the written one -- I'm not much on legal <br/>
trivia), and all that would happen is that the lawyers would get <br/>
rich.  (I'll bet its possible that posting to a public forum that <br/>
I committed a crime is slander (or libel), and I'll bet my slander <br/>
(or libel) case against you Annye, is stronger than your pornography <br/>
case against the moderators or Yahoo).<br/>
<br/>
So, hopefully we can dispense with that angle of this incident.<br/>
<br/>
I did not see the offensive material.  It was posted after I last checked <br/>
my e-mail, and deleted before I next checked it.  In my mind, (and I <br/>
have _not_ contacted an attorney), that is not a crime on my part.  <br/>
I did not post the offensive material, nor did I produce it.  I feel it<br/>
was unfortunate that it was posted (more on that following).  BTW, Yahoo,<br/>
I believe, requires adult supervision of all users of its system -- you<br/>
will have to check Yahoo's Terms of Use -- your legal beef is with <br/>
Yahoo anyway, not with the volunteer moderators (and besides, they have<br/>
more money than I do).<br/>
<br/>
For those who care, and it seems I have to explain the details of my<br/>
private life to everyone, Chester County PA (where I live) was under <br/>
flash floods the end of the week (those who watch the Weather Channel <br/>
would be aware of the severe weather the east has been getting), all the <br/>
creeks that surround my neighborhood were flooded, I had to leave my house <br/>
and stay in a hotel so I could assure myself I could get out Saturday.  <br/>
Saturday I had an 8 hour race that was rather grueling (I have witnesses <br/>
that I was there, rather than checking e-mail, and a receipt from the hotel <br/>
I stayed at (I do not own a laptop, PDA, or similar, and if I did, I <br/>
would not use it to check LbNA e-mail), Saturday evening I played Uncle <br/>
Wiggly with my son (who didn't see me at all Fri or Sat) due to the <br/>
circumstances.  I am now checking e-mail for the first time in a while, <br/>
weeding thru it all, as usual.  I have a life beyond LbNA, and the more <br/>
and more of this that happens, the more and more the LbNA portion shrinks.<br/>
<br/>
As I said, I did not see the content in question, but my guess is that<br/>
it falls under what it is called "spam".  Spam is a fact of life on the<br/>
internet, and if one is going to participate on the internet, one has to<br/>
learn to expect it, and develop a strategy for dealing with it.  The spam<br/>
is out of the control of the moderators, and out of the control of Yahoo,<br/>
tho both do what they can to mitigate it.  The only sure way to eliminate<br/>
spam is to eliminate the internet (there is a 17th century mathematical<br/>
proof that says the thieves will always be able to outwit the locksmiths --<br/>
I have not seen the proof, but my guess is that it applies to spam as <br/>
well).<br/>
<br/>
I get alot of spam that is pornographic.  I have a 5 year old son, and <br/>
like most people, abhor receiving pornography spam.  But I accept that <br/>
this is a fact of life on the internet, and don't let him use the <br/>
internet unsupervised.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE SPAM (PORNOGRAPHIC <br/>
OR OTHERWISE), 100%, AND THE MODERATORS AND YAHOO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO <br/>
DO THIS.  This is a fact of life, if you don't like it, I'm afraid you <br/>
will have to disconnect from the internet.<br/>
<br/>
All spam does is rile people up for no reason, and waste even more <br/>
bandwidth.<br/>
<br/>
Right now the the list is set so that only members may post, but anyone<br/>
can join.  Therefore anyone can spam by joining and then spamming.  An <br/>
alternative is to approve all memberships.  Then, a spammer, say John <br/>
Smith, could attempt to join the list.  Who are the moderators to say <br/>
John Smith 1 is a letterboxer and approve, and John Smith 2 is a spammer <br/>
and reject.  We could look at their e-mail and see if it looks "spammish"<br/>
(there are rules to do this, but those rules would also probably reject<br/>
Ryan's e-mail address).  We could just reject anyone.  We could ban the <br/>
people who annoy us.  We could moderate every post.  But most people over<br/>
the last 5 years have been basically happy, so no changes unless a poll<br/>
shows otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
There is an old saying that "with freedom comes responsibility".  We could<br/>
lock the list down so tight with moderation 10 ways from Sunday, but lots<br/>
of freedom restriction for people to use the resources for letterboxing<br/>
purposes (for example, we could ban file uploads, and all that letterboxing<br/>
content would go away), or better yet, we could nuke the list, the most<br/>
extreme example, no freedom, no responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
And on to other topics --<br/>
<br/>
* When is the last time you have _thanked_ the _volunteer_ moderators for<br/>
what they _do_ do?  Perhaps they don't do anything worthwhile.  Always<br/>
a possibility.  But like acting, you never notice good acting, but <br/>
immediately notice incompetent acting.<br/>
<br/>
* We could make this a pay to play service, and perhaps improve it.  I <br/>
think the general consensus is that LbNA is better as a commercial-free<br/>
service, tho.  Remember, no one that works around here makes a dime off<br/>
of the list or the website, but it costs time and money to do both.<br/>
<br/>
* Many people are burnt out of the letterboxing vs geocaching thing.  This<br/>
is now being deemed off-topic until further notice.  Some people like to <br/>
geocache.  Some people like to letterbox.   Some people like both.  Some <br/>
like neither.  Some thing one group is better than the other.  Some think <br/>
one group trashes the environment more.  Some think both trash the <br/>
environment.  Some think neither do.  Some like the music of Blink 182.  <br/>
I don't think there is much more that can be said on letterboxers vs <br/>
geocachers, so doing so is an invitation to be moderated.  Many people <br/>
are just sick of this endless us vs them thread coming around.<br/>
<br/>
* Many people are burnt out on off-topic posts.  The list has always been<br/>
loose and allowed off-topic within reason, but I agree that certain <br/>
off-topic is pushing the bounds of "related off-topic ok within reason".  <br/>
Don't be mad at me if I warn or moderate you for clearly off-topic <br/>
content.  We have to balance the desires of off-topic posters with those <br/>
who only want letterboxing content, and it is not an easy line to walk.  I<br/>
am just the messenger, and do not wish to be shot.  To be frank, I think <br/>
we've done a decent job of it in the past 5 years.  It seems, however, <br/>
the days of carefree, loose community are over.  Which is sad, because <br/>
it is possible with three things: tolerance, restraint, and common sense.  <br/>
<br/>
* I've been asked to remove jpgs related to geocaching.  I've already spent<br/>
an hour an a half on this, and my family wants me to do stuff with them,<br/>
so I will do it later (I have not looked at these either).  For now, don't<br/>
click on them, or perhaps Mischief can remove them.  (I have not seen them<br/>
and can not judge whether they are on-topic.  Mishief can make that judgement<br/>
if urgency on the matter is required).<br/>
<br/>
* Keep in mind that it is alot for a moderator to check the upload section<br/>
every day (or even every week).  I have a phone modem, living in a rural <br/>
area where broadband is unavailable.  That's the reality.  If something <br/>
looks off-topic, DON'T CLICK ON IT.  If the spammers cleverly disguise their<br/>
spam as on topic, that is a risk of the internet, and the moderators cannot<br/>
prevent that without (in the end) shutting down the list.<br/>
<br/>
* People have volunteered to be moderators.  Believe me, I don't want it,<br/>
but always thought I did a pretty good job (of course, it was easier when<br/>
it was only 10 people who understood the way things work).  I will consider <br/>
what I will do.  At the very least, I (along with the other moderators)<br/>
will consider the offers of help we have already received.<br/>
<br/>
* I will not be checking LbNA e-mail or the files section for a while.  <br/>
Consider this a warning if you want to.<br/>
<br/>
* This topic is now deemed off-topic.<br/>

the same from blaze and me - we are relative newbies to this hobby, but do<br/>
appreciate all the hard work and dedication that is put forth from the<br/>
moderators of this list as well as those who keep the website up and<br/>
functional.  you all are what makes this *sport* function and you deserve a<br/>
huge round of applause.<br/>

&gt; For the record, I have not committed any crimes recently.  Personally, <br/>
&gt; I don't want to deal with this.  I have no desire to distribute <br/>

&gt; I committed a crime is slander (or libel), and I'll bet my slander <br/>
&gt; (or libel) case against you Annye, is stronger than your pornography <br/>
&gt; case against the moderators or Yahoo).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, hopefully we can dispense with that angle of this incident.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did not see the offensive material.  It was posted after I last<br/>
checked <br/>
&gt; my e-mail, and deleted before I next checked it.  In my mind, (and I <br/>
&gt; have _not_ contacted an attorney), that is not a crime on my part.  <br/>
&gt; I did not post the offensive material, nor did I produce it.  I feel it<br/>
&gt; was unfortunate that it was posted (more on that following).  BTW,<br/>
Yahoo,<br/>
&gt; I believe, requires adult supervision of all users of its system -- you<br/>
&gt; will have to check Yahoo's Terms of Use -- your legal beef is with <br/>
&gt; Yahoo anyway, not with the volunteer moderators (and besides, they have<br/>
&gt; more money than I do).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those who care, and it seems I have to explain the details of my<br/>
&gt; private life to everyone, Chester County PA (where I live) was under <br/>
&gt; flash floods the end of the week (those who watch the Weather Channel <br/>
&gt; would be aware of the severe weather the east has been getting), all<br/>
the <br/>
&gt; creeks that surround my neighborhood were flooded, I had to leave my<br/>
house <br/>
&gt; and stay in a hotel so I could assure myself I could get out Saturday.  <br/>
&gt; Saturday I had an 8 hour race that was rather grueling (I have<br/>
witnesses <br/>
&gt; that I was there, rather than checking e-mail, and a receipt from<br/>
the hotel <br/>
&gt; I stayed at (I do not own a laptop, PDA, or similar, and if I did, I <br/>
&gt; would not use it to check LbNA e-mail), Saturday evening I played Uncle <br/>
&gt; Wiggly with my son (who didn't see me at all Fri or Sat) due to the <br/>
&gt; circumstances.  I am now checking e-mail for the first time in a while, <br/>
&gt; weeding thru it all, as usual.  I have a life beyond LbNA, and the more <br/>
&gt; and more of this that happens, the more and more the LbNA portion<br/>
shrinks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I said, I did not see the content in question, but my guess is that<br/>
&gt; it falls under what it is called "spam".  Spam is a fact of life on the<br/>
&gt; internet, and if one is going to participate on the internet, one has to<br/>
&gt; learn to expect it, and develop a strategy for dealing with it.  The<br/>
spam<br/>
&gt; is out of the control of the moderators, and out of the control of<br/>
Yahoo,<br/>
&gt; tho both do what they can to mitigate it.  The only sure way to<br/>
eliminate<br/>
&gt; spam is to eliminate the internet (there is a 17th century mathematical<br/>
&gt; proof that says the thieves will always be able to outwit the<br/>
locksmiths --<br/>
&gt; I have not seen the proof, but my guess is that it applies to spam as <br/>
&gt; well).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I get alot of spam that is pornographic.  I have a 5 year old son, and <br/>
&gt; like most people, abhor receiving pornography spam.  But I accept that <br/>
&gt; this is a fact of life on the internet, and don't let him use the <br/>
&gt; internet unsupervised.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE SPAM<br/>
(PORNOGRAPHIC <br/>
&gt; OR OTHERWISE), 100%, AND THE MODERATORS AND YAHOO WILL NOT BE ABLE TO <br/>
&gt; DO THIS.  This is a fact of life, if you don't like it, I'm afraid you <br/>
&gt; will have to disconnect from the internet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All spam does is rile people up for no reason, and waste even more <br/>
&gt; bandwidth.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; Right now the the list is set so that only members may post, but anyone<br/>
&gt; can join.  Therefore anyone can spam by joining and then spamming.  An <br/>
&gt; alternative is to approve all memberships.  Then, a spammer, say John <br/>
&gt; Smith, could attempt to join the list.  Who are the moderators to say <br/>
&gt; John Smith 1 is a letterboxer and approve, and John Smith 2 is a<br/>
spammer <br/>
&gt; and reject.  We could look at their e-mail and see if it looks<br/>
"spammish"<br/>
&gt; (there are rules to do this, but those rules would also probably reject<br/>
&gt; Ryan's e-mail address).  We could just reject anyone.  We could ban the <br/>
&gt; people who annoy us.  We could moderate every post.  But most people<br/>
over<br/>
&gt; the last 5 years have been basically happy, so no changes unless a poll<br/>
&gt; shows otherwise.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is an old saying that "with freedom comes responsibility".  We<br/>
could<br/>
&gt; lock the list down so tight with moderation 10 ways from Sunday, but<br/>
lots<br/>
&gt; of freedom restriction for people to use the resources for letterboxing<br/>
&gt; purposes (for example, we could ban file uploads, and all that<br/>
letterboxing<br/>
&gt; content would go away), or better yet, we could nuke the list, the most<br/>
&gt; extreme example, no freedom, no responsibility.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And on to other topics --<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * When is the last time you have _thanked_ the _volunteer_<br/>
moderators for<br/>
&gt; what they _do_ do?  Perhaps they don't do anything worthwhile.  Always<br/>
&gt; a possibility.  But like acting, you never notice good acting, but <br/>
&gt; immediately notice incompetent acting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * We could make this a pay to play service, and perhaps improve it.  I <br/>
&gt; think the general consensus is that LbNA is better as a commercial-free<br/>
&gt; service, tho.  Remember, no one that works around here makes a dime off<br/>
&gt; of the list or the website, but it costs time and money to do both.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Many people are burnt out of the letterboxing vs geocaching thing.<br/>
 This<br/>
&gt; is now being deemed off-topic until further notice.  Some people<br/>
like to <br/>
&gt; geocache.  Some people like to letterbox.   Some people like both. <br/>
Some <br/>
&gt; like neither.  Some thing one group is better than the other.  Some<br/>
think <br/>
&gt; one group trashes the environment more.  Some think both trash the <br/>
&gt; environment.  Some think neither do.  Some like the music of Blink<br/>
182.  <br/>
&gt; I don't think there is much more that can be said on letterboxers vs <br/>
&gt; geocachers, so doing so is an invitation to be moderated.  Many people <br/>
&gt; are just sick of this endless us vs them thread coming around.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Many people are burnt out on off-topic posts.  The list has always<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; loose and allowed off-topic within reason, but I agree that certain <br/>
&gt; off-topic is pushing the bounds of "related off-topic ok within<br/>
reason".  <br/>
&gt; Don't be mad at me if I warn or moderate you for clearly off-topic <br/>
&gt; content.  We have to balance the desires of off-topic posters with<br/>
those <br/>
&gt; who only want letterboxing content, and it is not an easy line to<br/>
walk.  I<br/>
&gt; am just the messenger, and do not wish to be shot.  To be frank, I<br/>
think <br/>
&gt; we've done a decent job of it in the past 5 years.  It seems, however, <br/>
&gt; the days of carefree, loose community are over.  Which is sad, because <br/>
&gt; it is possible with three things: tolerance, restraint, and common<br/>
sense.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * I've been asked to remove jpgs related to geocaching.  I've<br/>
already spent<br/>
&gt; an hour an a half on this, and my family wants me to do stuff with them,<br/>
&gt; so I will do it later (I have not looked at these either).  For now,<br/>
don't<br/>
&gt; click on them, or perhaps Mischief can remove them.  (I have not<br/>
seen them<br/>
&gt; and can not judge whether they are on-topic.  Mishief can make that<br/>
judgement<br/>
&gt; if urgency on the matter is required).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Keep in mind that it is alot for a moderator to check the upload<br/>
section<br/>
&gt; every day (or even every week).  I have a phone modem, living in a<br/>
rural <br/>
&gt; area where broadband is unavailable.  That's the reality.  If something <br/>
&gt; looks off-topic, DON'T CLICK ON IT.  If the spammers cleverly<br/>
disguise their<br/>
&gt; spam as on topic, that is a risk of the internet, and the moderators<br/>
cannot<br/>
&gt; prevent that without (in the end) shutting down the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * People have volunteered to be moderators.  Believe me, I don't<br/>

I'm TOTALLY new to Letterboxing, haven't even had time to hunt for my <br/>
first one yet!  (Hope to remedy that soon!)  But this group all seems <br/>
to be such a great group, I like how you all support each other and <br/>
have friendly competitions and at the same time encourage each other <br/>

moderators for<br/>
&gt; what they _do_ do?  Perhaps they don't do anything worthwhile.  <br/>
Always<br/>
&gt; a possibility.  But like acting, you never notice good acting, but <br/>
&gt; immediately notice incompetent acting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * We could make this a pay to play service, and perhaps improve <br/>
it.  I <br/>
&gt; think the general consensus is that LbNA is better as a commercial-<br/>
free<br/>
&gt; service, tho.  Remember, no one that works around here makes a dime <br/>
off<br/>
&gt; of the list or the website, but it costs time and money to do both.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Many people are burnt out of the letterboxing vs geocaching <br/>
thing.  This<br/>
&gt; is now being deemed off-topic until further notice.  Some people <br/>
like to <br/>
&gt; geocache.  Some people like to letterbox.   Some people like both.  <br/>
Some <br/>
&gt; like neither.  Some thing one group is better than the other.  Some <br/>
think <br/>
&gt; one group trashes the environment more.  Some think both trash the <br/>
&gt; environment.  Some think neither do.  Some like the music of Blink <br/>
182.  <br/>
&gt; I don't think there is much more that can be said on letterboxers <br/>
vs <br/>
&gt; geocachers, so doing so is an invitation to be moderated.  Many <br/>
people <br/>
&gt; are just sick of this endless us vs them thread coming around.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Many people are burnt out on off-topic posts.  The list has <br/>
always been<br/>
&gt; loose and allowed off-topic within reason, but I agree that certain <br/>
&gt; off-topic is pushing the bounds of "related off-topic ok within <br/>
reason".  <br/>
&gt; Don't be mad at me if I warn or moderate you for clearly off-topic <br/>
&gt; content.  We have to balance the desires of off-topic posters with <br/>
those <br/>
&gt; who only want letterboxing content, and it is not an easy line to <br/>
walk.  I<br/>
&gt; am just the messenger, and do not wish to be shot.  To be frank, I <br/>
think <br/>
&gt; we've done a decent job of it in the past 5 years.  It seems, <br/>
however, <br/>
&gt; the days of carefree, loose community are over.  Which is sad, <br/>
because <br/>
&gt; it is possible with three things: tolerance, restraint, and common <br/>
sense.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * I've been asked to remove jpgs related to geocaching.  I've <br/>
already spent<br/>
&gt; an hour an a half on this, and my family wants me to do stuff with <br/>
them,<br/>
&gt; so I will do it later (I have not looked at these either).  For <br/>
now, don't<br/>
&gt; click on them, or perhaps Mischief can remove them.  (I have not <br/>
seen them<br/>
&gt; and can not judge whether they are on-topic.  Mishief can make that <br/>
judgement<br/>
&gt; if urgency on the matter is required).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * Keep in mind that it is alot for a moderator to check the upload <br/>
section<br/>
&gt; every day (or even every week).  I have a phone modem, living in a <br/>
rural <br/>
&gt; area where broadband is unavailable.  That's the reality.  If <br/>
something <br/>
&gt; looks off-topic, DON'T CLICK ON IT.  If the spammers cleverly <br/>
disguise their<br/>
&gt; spam as on topic, that is a risk of the internet, and the <br/>
moderators cannot<br/>
&gt; prevent that without (in the end) shutting down the list.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * People have volunteered to be moderators.  Believe me, I don't <br/>
want it,<br/>
&gt; but always thought I did a pretty good job (of course, it was <br/>
easier when<br/>
&gt; it was only 10 people who understood the way things work).  I will <br/>
consider <br/>
&gt; what I will do.  At the very least, I (along with the other <br/>
moderators)<br/>
&gt; will consider the offers of help we have already received.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * I will not be checking LbNA e-mail or the files section for a <br/>
while.  <br/>
&gt; Consider this a warning if you want to.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * This topic is now deemed off-topic.<br/>
