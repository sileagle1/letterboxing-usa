from Westwoods last weekend.  I will update my website to reflect its <br/>
status.  <br/>
<br/>
I talked to my husband about placing it somewhere else at Westwoods <br/>
or another area entirely.  I think that it belongs at "Dinosaur" rock <br/>
in Westwoods and have decided to just retire it.  It was the first LB <br/>
that we ever placed in an area that has special memories for me.  It <br/>
was the first stamp I ever carved and the first clues I ever wrote <br/>
(or ever got so screwed up - ask Jay).  <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to a week off work to find and place more boxes.<br/>
