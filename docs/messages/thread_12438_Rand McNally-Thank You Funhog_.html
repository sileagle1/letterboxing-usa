My Rand McNally is also a road atlas, but it is the largescale version with<br/>
spiral binding.  It may be a little more detailed, but I don't think it is<br/>
much.  At first, I didn't think it had counties then I looked closer.  I<br/>
recommend looking on your own state for counties you know.  Then you<br/>
recognize the names.  My map has the counties in lighter green letters that<br/>
don't stand out much (it's printed in the same color as the forest names.  I<br/>
have the regular road atlas in my office.  I will try to remember to look<br/>
and see if counties are there.<br/>
