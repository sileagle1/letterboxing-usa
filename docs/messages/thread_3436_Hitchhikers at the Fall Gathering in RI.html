The Fall Gathering at Burlingame Park in RI seems to be shaping up as a coming together not only of letterboxers, but of "hitch-hikers" (traveling boxes) as well.  We have heard that several of them will be traveling from far and wide to get there.  So, just to insure that each one gets a "personalized" ride home afterwards, we would like to offer the following guidelines:  Everyone please feel free to stamp in and chat with as many hitchhikers as you can find, but once you have picked one up to take home with you and give a ride to your next LB destination, please be generous and leave any additional ones you might find for other letterboxers.  That way we won't have someone going home with half a dozen hitchhiker boxes while someone else goes home with none!<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, each letterboxing family, group, or solo adventurer can take home one hitchhiker box or perhaps some other token of their Burlingame trip.  (Trish has given us several mysterious red-wrapped packages to spread around in Burlingame area letterboxes, so everyone should have some happy hunting!)<br/>

I've done a carving for the competition how bout everyone else get <br/>
