&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is often obscure...  intentionally.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes boxers will post to this list that they have a traveler <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; if there is a secret word or riddle, etc...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes they will note it in a box clue...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes it will be noted on a boxer's personal web page...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes it is word of mouth from other boxers...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes there may be an indication on their person (i.e.  a pin<br/>
&gt; that says, "ask me")...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Limitless possibilities.  There is no list.  That is part of the <br/>
fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If in doubt, when you meet another boxer...  ask them!<br/>

&gt; &gt; How exactly does one know a Boxer is carrying a Traveler? If they<br/>
&gt; sometimes require you to solve a riddle or complete a task, how do<br/>
&gt; you know to do it?  Do you ask every boxer you meet "Do you have a<br/>

&gt; &gt; Are they listed somewhere?<br/>
