attempted to find Casco Bay Letterbox and Starry Night, but were <br/>
unsuccessful. I think it was because we were getting tired. We had <br/>
such a good time that we planned to do it again this week. <br/>

We went out again yesterday and found: The Key to the City, Starry <br/>
Night, Munjoy Hill Observatory, Pizza Pie, and much to our surprize, <br/>
Casco Bay! By the time we found Casco Bay, it was getting really <br/>
late so we had to call it a night, but we are going out again this <br/>
weekend! This hobby sure is addicting!<br/>
