I'd have to agree with missmoon here. One well done letterbox is <br/>
enough for me to find in a day. I live in an area where there are not <br/>
very many letterboxes at all, but I still wonder where people will be <br/>
placing them in ten years. We don't talk much about retiring <br/>
letterboxes. But ideally, that is how each letterbox would finish <br/>
it's life. And eventually we would hear about retiring boxes almost <br/>
as frequently as newly planted ones. I'm just echoing that at some <br/>
point saturation will occur and change the way we do things.<br/>

I don't want to go out and find 30 or 40 boxes in one weekend. <br/>
Where's the fun in that? It's fishing in a barrel. And I'd rather <br/>
plant one really cool one that took some time to do than go out on <br/>
weekends and plant tons of them each time. But that's just me. <br/>
