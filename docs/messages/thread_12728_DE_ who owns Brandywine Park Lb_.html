Brandywine Park Lb is missing. The clues are perfect - found the tree, the <br/>
pile of rocks behind it - but no box. I don't know what the etiquette is on <br/>
this but it was such a splendid place, we replaced it with a box I happened <br/>
to have with me. The stamp is not appropriate (planned to place it in <br/>
Lancaster Co., PA) but at least there's a box.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't posted this to the list yet but plan to call it "Brandywine Park <br/>
Redoux" if you say it's OK.<br/>

<br/>
I did this once after searching for a box in Central New York that had been <br/>
reported missing on list a few times. I carved a stamp especially for the <br/>
possibility of not finding it, though, and called it "Imposter #1."<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info/box_imposter1.shtml<br/>
<br/>
I figured that if we found the original box where it should be, I'd just <br/>
save the stamp for a future similar situation. We didn't find the box after <br/>
a *very* thorough search, so I left mine in the place we first thought the <br/>
box should be. The clues to the original box (Bus Driver's) are still on <br/>
the site, with my clues listed as a separate box.<br/>
<br/>
No one's reported finding the Bus Driver's box since I tried. I've heard <br/>
second-hand that at least a few people have found my replacement box, <br/>
though (I live too far away to go back and check for myself).<br/>
<br/>
If the original Brandywine Park LB somehow reappears, then your box will be <br/>
a bonus!<br/>
