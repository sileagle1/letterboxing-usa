My first post to this list, though I've been lurking for months.  Gee, I didn't think I'd be so nervous! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my sister, my 2-year old, and I just came back from a week in Cape Cod.  I printed out 60 clues before I left, figuring I wouldn't have computer access and didn't know where I would find myself on the Cape.  I was not anticipating that I'd spend half my vacation waiting for my car to have it's clutch totally replaced by a random mechanic I found in the yellow pages.  (At least we could walk to the beach...)   Well, we attempted 4 and found all 4, so it was a very encouraging intro to letterboxing for my sister.  (The baby is a pro - she's got about 40 stamps in her own logbook so far...) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's my (rather meager) Cape Cod update: <br/>
<br/>
Railroad Bridge - oh, THOSE 2 picnic tables!  Got it.  Fabulous stamp! <br/>
<br/>
Cape Cod Canal Railroad Bridge - No problem.  (except finding a subtle/suitable place to stamp in...) <br/>
<br/>
Four Ponds - we got eaten ALIVE by the skeeters, but we found it, and we were all excited to see the swans a'swimming that were mentioned in the clues.  That was really great. <br/>
<br/>
Lawrence - although it was our first find of the week, I've saved it for last because it was the best adventure.  The clues mention that while it is hidden on Lawrence Island, Lawrence Island isn't actually an island, but really a peninsula.  Ummm, maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe sometimes it's an island?  Because while getting there was not bad at all, on the way back we had a bit of a problem.   The little wodden plank bridge we had crossed earlier was now floating about a foot and a half under water!  The best part was when I stepped onto the bridge (with the baby in the backpack) and it sunk an extra few inches down to the supports it was on.  Well, we came out of it wet to our knees but laughing, so all was fine!  I just don't know if the placer is aware that this "bridge"  is susceptible to high tide.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wish we'd had time to do more, but we all enjoyed the adventures we had.  Thanks! <br/>
