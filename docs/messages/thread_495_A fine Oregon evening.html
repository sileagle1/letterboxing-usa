                    <div class="plaintext-content">Finally turned the computer off &amp; bolted out the back door with the<br/>
beagle in tow.  Sunny, almost warm and the swallows are skimming &amp;<br/>
diving over the pond.  Good time to check the boxes.  Mitch reports that<br/>
he has visited the recently reborn Rock Creek #1, and suspicions that<br/>
Cara may have found Possum's Penthouse.<br/>
<br/>
A Red-winged blackbird with red and yellow epaulets regards me in the<br/>
middle of his announcements of territory and availability.  The beagle<br/>
is scouring the shoreline for leftovers from the fishermen.  The last<br/>
remnants of a crappy work day &amp; other peripheral junk leak out of the<br/>
head as I cross the bridge &amp; head into letterboxland.<br/>
<br/>
Rock Creek #1 is by far the most public box I have placed.  A quick<br/>
check to see just how alone I am.  New stamps by Mitch's mom-in-law and<br/>
Cara has returned!  Now this little notebook is getting some use!!! <br/>
Once again happy that it was returned unharmed.<br/>
<br/>
Once RC#1 is replaced, I continue.  I pause before leaving the trail to<br/>
inspect RC#2... tall grass &amp; reports of major sneezing &amp; itching remind<br/>
me that I didn't take any allergy stuff... a bad mistake &amp; one I am not<br/>
willing to compound...  off to the woods for the remainder.  The beagle<br/>
is pouting, the recent crop of fishermen have been tidier than those in<br/>
the recent past.<br/>
<br/>
Once into the woods I head for "the penthouse."  Marvelling at how<br/>
things have leafed out in the past weeks &amp; keeping an eye out for the<br/>
bobcat rumoured to inhabit this area.  The Park Naturalist doubts its<br/>
existence, but would LOVE to get a confirmation &amp; any fox sitings as<br/>
well.  Possum's Penthouse has indeed been found &amp; Cara makes me aware<br/>
that it might be a tough find for anyone "height challenged."  Sorry<br/>
Cara...<br/>
<br/>
The beagle has disappeared, but I am interested to see how Mitch's box<br/>
is doing.  I stop in to admire the comments &amp; his stamp carving<br/>
ability.  So careful &amp; controlled in comparison to my slash &amp; jab<br/>
attempts.<br/>
<br/>
Time to head home... the beagle is nowhere to be seen.  Whistles &amp; yells<br/>
bring no response.  This can only mean one thing.  I follow the trail to<br/>
the swimming "hole."  Recent activity &amp; trash, including nearly an<br/>
entire bag of cheetos... being hungrily consumed by one beagle.  She<br/>
slinks up the bank at my call... orange snout and all.  There will be<br/>
hell to pay later as her digestive system copes with this latest<br/>
find.... <br/>

I've seen both a fox and a coyote within 2 blocks of my house, but no <br/>
bobcats.  Also, I've seen lots of deer tracks near bridge #3 on your way to <br/>
the Rock Creek Troll letterbox.<br/>

Nicely enough, these would also be on the way out to my Waterfalls series <br/>
