I wonder if it would be too much to ask those who reply and let the replied <br/>
to message linger at the bottom of the new message to delete the copy of <br/>
the message to which you are replying from your own--or perhaps cut all out <br/>
except the part that is particularly relevant?  The digests are quite long <br/>
and mostly<br/>
<br/>

I like reading what you all say, but hate scrolling through lots of &gt;&gt;<br/>

AGREED, Dennis. That same idea occurs to me each and every time I <br/>
read these posts that the ENTIRE previous or "replied to" message is <br/>
unnecessarily copied at the end. It just one of the finer points <br/>
of "netiquette" that many e-mailers aren't even aware of.<br/>
<br/>
"Cleaning up" your message before you hit the "reply" button is a <br/>
kind thing to do...and this letterboxing bunch we are fortunate to be <br/>
a part of seems like a kind crew indeed.<br/>
<br/>
Enough writing...I think I'm headed to find the Green Trails boxes in <br/>
the morning!<br/>
