I would have to answer B - Amused.<br/>
<br/>
I think it also depends on how far away the state is.  Here in the Western US, our states are pretty large so having clues for another state can mean between  a full days drive just to get to the other state much less have time to look for a box as opposed to the East Coast where an entire state may be driven across in 2-3 hours (far, far less in the case of Rhode Island <grin>).<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Here in DE, it only takes about half an hour to get across the widest <br/>
part, and only about 2 1/2 hours to drive north to south. I can be in <br/>
PA, NJ, or MD all within half an hour. <br/>
They just changed DE's motto to "It's Good Being First" or some kinda <br/>
crap like that. Personally I liked "Small Wonder". Now I'm thinkin' <br/>
maybe they should have changed it to "It's Good Being Small".  :)<br/>

PS-the answer to the original question would be "It depends on what <br/>
state it is."  ;)<br/>

ECSTATIC!!!  This just happened to us a few months ago--we found a <br/>
perplexing resident clue to a letterbox in a neighboring state from <br/>
where the original letterbox was located (about 250 miles away--one <br/>
way!) and eventually were able to visit the bonus box and stamp in, <br/>
as well.  Simply thrilling as it led us to a really cool spot we <br/>
otherwise would never have visited...<br/>

It might be odd to find clues for California in a Maryland box, but if the state was a close neighbor I'd consider it a challange and start planning a day/weekend trip. This would definitely depend on the person though. Some people travel ALOT, others don't wander far from home. I'd say go for it.<br/>

  E.    Intrigued and ready to go find it when I have plans to go that way, or make up some other excuse to go that way. <s>.  Then I'd do a search for all the boxes in that area and compile a stack of them with a map of the area.  I'd try to think of a good way to get someone to go with me and make a coupla days out of it.<br/>
<br/>
  This might all wait until the "doing" phase, like maybe next spring or summer.  But I'd keep it all very handy, just     in    case   ...<br/>

  Maybe another poll could ask, "Do you need a really good reason (like a sane or normal one, such as visiting relatives) to go out of state for letterboxing?"<br/>
<br/>
  A.  Yes<br/>
  B.  No<br/>
  C.  What do you mean, "sane or normal"?<br/>
  D.  In my state, we check our oil and cancel the newspaper before we leave for the border.<br/>

Wouldn't you be leaving the clues in the box anyway for the next<br/>
letterboxer to find?  You would need to copy the clues.  I thought<br/>
that's how Cuckoo clues worked.<br/>

P.S. I went out to check on my first plant, and discovered that it's<br/>
had it's first finder!  I know this is probably trivial to most of<br/>
you.  But it means that there are other letterboxers willing to come<br/>
to Chatauqua County, New York to letterbox.  I'll be planning more<br/>
letterboxes over the winter.<br/>
