<br/>
I was thinking...It seems as though most folks can make it either on<br/>
July 12th or 13th.  I was thinking about looking into renting a group<br/>
camping area at Milo McIver State Park (Estacada area, I think).  I<br/>
believe the group camping area will take about 25 campers.  I have a<br/>
friend who works at for the State Parks Department and he's the one who<br/>
told me about the possiblity of getting the group campsite.  I would<br/>
have to call State Parks and reserve it (as long as it's available).<br/>
I'd do it for the Friday and Saturday nights and we would have a weekend<br/>
gathering and people could come and go as they please, throughout.  What<br/>
do you think?<br/>
<br/>
I'd love some feedback on this.  I think there are at least 4<br/>
people/familiies who have mentioned camping there for the gathering.<br/>
This would be pretty nifty.  We'd all be kind of together and it would<br/>
make camping and exchanging easy.  I'll look into it if there is enough<br/>
interest.  We're thinking of taking a drive out to this park this<br/>
weekend to check it out.  I'm not sure if I've ever been there or not.<br/>
It would give us the chance to see if we can land the Royal Angler<br/>
Letterbox, too.  <br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you all think!  Thanks so much.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
