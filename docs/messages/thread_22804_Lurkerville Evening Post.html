In our opinion:<br/>
<br/>
This is most certainly a game, and at its best, a challenging one.  It is about mystery, art, exploration and, most importantly, effort.  It is not for everyone.  People have different talents and different degrees of talent.  Some may find their talents do not mesh well with some elements of the game.  We would make very poor sumo wrestlers, and we do not expect sumo wrestling to accomodate us.  We do not expect to find every box, nor do we expect everyone to find our boxes.  We expect there to be risks and rewards, triumphant successes and utterly spectacular failures.  Those inclined to consume or produce a literal or figurative 'walk in the park' box can do so, but should know and expect that some are playing an intellectual contact sport.  The game itself is not FOR children, though it may be played by chidren if properly supervised, coached and supported by an adult, as hockey may be.  It is not more than it is.  It is not about making people feel like winners or losers.  Whether the participant 'wins' or 'loses' is determined individually by that participant.  There should be no status indicators.  This is not about being mundane, convenient or emotionally or intellectually safe.  You should always face the possibility that you will walk far and find nothing.  That is what makes finding something a special thing.  <br/>
