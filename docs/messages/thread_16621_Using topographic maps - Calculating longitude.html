&gt; I haven't figured out an *easy* way to measure longitude on the<br/>
&gt; trail, but Lewis and Clark--if I recall correctly--would do stuff<br/>
&gt; like find the position of the moon's of Jupiter at a certain time and<br/>
&gt; after returning back to civilization could look up what the<br/>
&gt; longitutde was based on such measurements.  Even that famous duo had<br/>
&gt; trouble measuring longitude while on the trail.  But perhaps with<br/>
&gt; today's maps, at least you can make sure you're "close enough" and<br/>
&gt; not need to be as precise as that.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could try to do it the way the old mariners used to.  They had two clocks, one that was set to Greenwich Mean time.  The other would be set to noon every day when the sun reached it highest point.  They would use some math formula (which I don't know) to calculate the longitude.  Just bring two watches with you on the trail and you should be able to calculate longitude with no problems!  ; )<br/>

What an EXCELLENT idea!  I guess L&amp;C had trouble with a pocket watch <br/>
or two, but man has finally solved that problem and it would <br/>
certainly be easier than finding the position of Juptier's moons.<br/>
<br/>
I may become a geocacher yet--although without the use of a GPS.  <br/>
Wimps.  All of them.  ;o)<br/>
