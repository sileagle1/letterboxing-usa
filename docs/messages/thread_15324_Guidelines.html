If I were to post a question, then I wouldn't feel it was STUPID<br/>
I personally have only found 6 boxes and have yet to post to this board until <br/>
now.  But after reading the "guidelines" I do not believe I nor my friends <br/>
will be staying with this board.<br/>
Also:<br/>
Don't become an excessive poster -- well people can just delete the ones they <br/>
do not want to read. No one is obligated to read them all.<br/>
<br/>
As for the rest of the page, I feel the person who posted these guidelines <br/>
needs a little lesson in how to treat people properly.  WE ARE HUMAN YOU KNOW <br/>
AND HAVE FEELINGS.  <br/>
now that I have finished putting in my 2 cents, Ill end this email.<br/>
Good-bye<br/>

months) "Newbie" too. Some things have been said about us recently that <br/>
have been disturbing and discouraging, but I got to know some wonderful <br/>
Lb'ing people at the Ithaca, NY Gathering this past Saturday that I <br/>
wouldn't have met had I not stuck with the board.<br/>
    Give it some more time.<br/>
