                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today saw the rain still coming down but Gabriel, my trusty <br/>
motorcycle, and I decided to plant that stamp. It is carved in honor <br/>
of a lady whose moniker is Blue Moon Hawk. <br/>
<br/>
The drive to Lopez is beautiful. Right near the park is the only <br/>
orange grove I know of in the county. Today the orange blossoms were <br/>
intoxicating. <br/>
<br/>
The box is close to a ranger's hut and may be under observation. Be <br/>
cool about getting it and putting it back. You do not have to enter <br/>
the park to get the box. <br/>
<br/>
While I did not see any poison oak, there may well be some. Also <br/>
rattlesnakes and such do live out there. Be careful reaching into <br/>
strange areas.<br/>
<br/>
Clues: easy <br/>
Hike: ridiculously easy<br/>
Stamp: fairly nice<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
0. Take Hiway 101 to the Grand Ave. Exit in Arroyo Grande.<br/>
1. Take Grand Avenue East toward the mountains.<br/>
2. Go through scenic old town Arroyo.<br/>
3. Go to the threeway stop sign where 227 continues to San Luis <br/>
Obispo but turn right upon the road to Lopez Lake.<br/>
4. Go 5.4 miles east to Biddle Park<br/>
5. Turn right onto the park road<br/>
6. Just before you get to the ranger shack (less than 0.1 mi)  there <br/>
is an approximately 50 ft. long log on the left (east) side of the <br/>
drive. Turn around and park just before it.<br/>
7. There is a No Parking Sign with a right arrow posted there. Go <br/>
stand right in front of it, facing the sign.<br/>
8. A little to your forward right are a series of three and then two <br/>
small posts. Go to the farthest post. It has a reflector strip on it.<br/>
9. Take six paces (single) to your left.<br/>
10. There are two logs set in a sort of a lying down vee pointed at <br/>
the road.<br/>
11. The farthest log of the two is hollow. The box is in there.<br/>
<br/>
Good hunting,<br/>
