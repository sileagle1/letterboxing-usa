                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey everyone,<br/>
I'm still here... but shockingly inactive.<br/>
Haven't had time to check on my boxes yet, but hope to soon.<br/>
I'm on digest, so sometimes I don't follow threads as well as I<br/>
might, but the latest discussion of Uncle Walter's (did someone<br/>
answer that question? that Uncle Walter's is a carving medium<br/>
that comes in larger, thicker sizes than erasers?) reminds me<br/>
to tell you the scoop, if you haven't heard yet ...<br/>
It's really a double-dipper scoop ~ the first scoop is Uncle Walter's<br/>
has sold the carving material portion of his biz to Mars Staedtler.<br/>
The second scoop is that Mars Staedtler is marketing the material<br/>
under a different name... Marscarve. So UW is still available ~<br/>
and may be available from a store near you .... and the bad <br/>
news is that for those of us who LOVE Mars Staedtler erasers,<br/>
we must rein in ... we thought that the advertised Marscarve<br/>
was for larger versions of our beloved Mars, but come to find <br/>
out that it's UW in Mars clothing ...<br/>
Learned this from people in the loop on the carving list ...<br/>
Have fun at the gathering!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now, Deborah, THAT'S a scoop! We've really liked carving our "mars <br/>
bars," because they're so smooth and buttery and seem to hold ink <br/>
nicely, but they are a little small. We've done a couple of stamps <br/>
using more than one eraser to make up for it. Then we tried a couple <br/>
with Helix Jumbo Professionals, which have a little more real estate <br/>
to work with, but they're a stiffer vinyl and hard for our taste, <br/>
seem to dull our tools, and they have a sort of harsh resistance to <br/>
the ink we use. After doing about 6 or 8 of them, we went back to a <br/>
Mars, and WOW. They're nice. We've never tried Uncle Walter's, (or <br/>
Tom's favorite, Factus). Where can we get them?<br/>

esoteric, technical post on the lists you subscribe to? You should <br/>
hear the tandem bicycle folks obsess over which brake lever works <br/>
best on "tandem@hobbes") in Connecticut.<br/>
