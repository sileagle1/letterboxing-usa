<br/>
Consider yourself warned. I haven't posted a sitrep<br/>
since the beginning of July. If you have no interest<br/>
in this sort of thing, feel free to move along...<br/>
<br/>
Fourth of July found us at the following places:<br/>
My Favorite Things series: We had to go here twice to<br/>
get all four of the boxes. Many thanks to Music Woman<br/>
for a hint or two. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It's Not So Ruff: Think this one is missing. We found<br/>
the landmarks in the clues, but no box. Anyone been<br/>
here lately?<br/>
<br/>
The Stamp Studio: A noteworthy stop as we inducted a<br/>
friend of ours into the hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Bobber Birthday: Our friend's first find on the trail.<br/>
The box was wet inside, and some slugs thought it<br/>
would make a nice home. The container needs replacing.<br/>
<br/>
Soaring Eagle: Another nice rtrw box to add to our<br/>
collection.<br/>
<br/>
July 6 found us in Coventry:<br/>
Eternal Love: Nice old graveyard. Wish the rest of the<br/>
day went this smoothly....<br/>
<br/>
DEP Nathan Hale State Forest: Another nice DEP box.<br/>
Wish all state and federal agencies were as<br/>
enlightened!<br/>
<br/>
Kind Of Corney: No problems to report here either.<br/>
Those come later. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Connecticut State Stamp: Our first one of this series.<br/>
If all of them are like this one, it's going to be<br/>
well worth driving all over creation for them. :-) <br/>
<br/>
Gaelach freamhs bosca: This will teach us to read the<br/>
clues more carefully before we leave. We didn't<br/>
realize that some of the words were in Gaelic!<br/>
Needless to say, we'll have to come back for this one,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Presidential Animals: Somehow, we walked right past<br/>
the first one, and had to get it on the way out. <br/>
<br/>
BenE: The trail marks are terrible!! We eventually<br/>
found it, despite the trail marks. Decided not to<br/>
tackle the Watership Down boxes as a result. Another<br/>
excuse to go back to Coventry....especially since we<br/>
were saving the John Wayne series anyway....<br/>
<br/>
KJ's Best: Been here before. Decided to stop in for<br/>
dinner, and check on the box. It wasn't where we<br/>
remembered. So, thinking someone might have had it<br/>
out, we ate and then checked again before we left.<br/>
Still no dice. Has this one been removed?<br/>
<br/>
If Wishes Were Horses: Missed this one. We thought we<br/>
had the right place, but the clues didn't quite match<br/>
up. After poking around for about a half hour, we<br/>
called it quits. Not much daylight left.....<br/>
<br/>
Pennsylvania State Stamp: As we walked up to the place<br/>
where the box is hidden, my son said, "That would be a<br/>
great place for a box." Smart kid. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
Erin Go Braugh: Only got numbers 1 and 3 on this one.<br/>
The rhino tree was nowhere to be found, and though we<br/>
thought we had the right area for both four and five,<br/>
we came up empty again. Never had so much trouble in<br/>
one day before....<br/>
<br/>
Finally, in no particular order, are the rest of our<br/>
stops leading up to today's adventures:<br/>
<br/>
Poet's Seat Tower #3 and 4: We originally reported the<br/>
third one missing, and the owner decided to post a<br/>
fourth one, so when we went back we got them both. The<br/>
view is well worth the drive, all you CT boxers!<br/>
<br/>
DEP Nipmuck State Forest: Our seventh DEP box. How<br/>
cool are these boxes and clues, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Nipmuck Laurel Sanctuary: No issues, other than we<br/>
were out in Union a couple of days before the Maine<br/>
State Stamp was released. Typical.... <br/>
<br/>
Sharp Dressed Man: Nothing like boxing in the rain!<br/>
Lots of visitors here.<br/>
<br/>
Riverfront Trail: Another great Craig and Bill box.<br/>
<br/>
Charter Oak Greenway: See above comment. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Catch and Release HH: Our thanks to the nice folks who<br/>
kindly told us they had released this HH at Holcomb<br/>
farm. Made a special run out there just to try to find<br/>
it! First HH in almost 100 finds.<br/>
<br/>
There you have it, folks. If you're still reading at<br/>
this point, it's been a most boxious July, with more<br/>
to come. We're off to do a Sunday Drive on a Saturday<br/>
afternoon!<br/>
