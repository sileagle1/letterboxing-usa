<div>Here are clues for the last set of hidden boxes.  Look for part 2 (4 
boxes) coming soon!  Enjoy-Melissa, Dan &amp; Max</div>

<div><b><u>
<p align="center">DPNC Nature Series-Part 1</p></u></b>
<p align="center">Mystic, CT</p>
<p align="center">Placed: 11/24/02</p>
<p align="center">2 boxes</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="left">Driving Direction: Take I-95 to exit 90 and follow signs off of 
the highway to the Pequotsepos Nature Center. Park in the lot by the nature 
center.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">To find the boxes:</p>
<p align="left">Cross the road and follow the yellow trail up into the woods. Wind 
around and climb the trail up through the ledge. Pass a huge tree then turn 
right onto the purple trail. You will pass under the powerlines and climb over a 
stone wall. Soon the path will be edged with stone. At the Y, left takes you on 
your way. (Right, and then right again will take you up to an abandoned quary.) 
</p>
<p align="left">Follow the trail and go over or under the blazed log blocking your 
path. A rock wall begin on your left, then the trail takes a sharp left through 
the wall. Continue on. When a building is in sight, the trail turns to the right 
and goes over a stone wall once again.</p>
<p align="left">This trail is called the Stone Bridges Trail and soon you will 
find out why. Cross the stone bridge then twist and turn through the brush. You 
will come to the corner of a stone wall. A canal will be straight ahead, but the 
trail turns left. Continue on past a pond on the left. At the end of the pond, 
hike through the pines. Soon you will come to the end, marked with 2 purple 
blazes. From the double blazed tree walk 19/20 steps at 290. Carefully reach 
deep inside to grab the Ringneck Snake by its tail!</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">This summer at DPNC nature camp, we were out searching for 
salamanders. We found a few hiding in soggy, rotting logs and carefully pulled 
them out. I was looking in a log where we had already found a few, when I saw a 
little gray tail sticking out. Thinking it was another marbled salamander, I 
grabbed the tail and pulled it out. Only it wasnt a short little salamander! 
The tail kept coming and coming! I realized that this was a snake! Pulling it 
all of the way out we saw the long, gray body with a bright yellow ring around 
its neck. The kids were psyched, not only had we caught lots of salamanders, but 
a wild snake as well!</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Now, go back on the purple trail the way that you came until you 
reach the yellow/purple intersection by the giant pine. Dont go left by the 
pine, instead continue and take the 2nd right onto yellow (Denison Farm Trail). 
Hike the yellow trail over a wooden bridge. Then come out by the field. Walk 
along the left edge of the field and look for the yellow. Go back into the woods 
on the left, cross a bridge, then go down hill through a wall and over a 
boardwalk. </p>
<p>You will come out in another field. Go straight across, this time on the 
right side of the field, and look for the purple trail entering the woods on the 
other side. Follow this trail until you reach 3 posts. From the posts take 17 
steps back the way you came. Look right, off trail for a hole in a tree. 
Carefully pull out the friendly Wood Frog.</p></div></body></html>
