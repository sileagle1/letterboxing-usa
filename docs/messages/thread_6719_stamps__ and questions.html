<br/>
<br/>
I also am having great fun carving -- it's addictive!  My favorite<br/>
thing to carve has been the Mars Staedtler erasers, although larger<br/>
than pink or red erasers (1.5" x 3"), they are still limited in<br/>
size.  I like the pink Speedy-Stamp also but not the price.<br/>
Yesterday I found another product made by Speedball, called Speedy- Cut,<br/>
which comes in 2.75" x 4.5" blocks for $2 at Hobby Lobby.  I<br/>
have not yet carved it, but the consistency feels creamy like the<br/>
Mars erasers.  I have also seen the PZ Cut mentioned by Don praised<br/>
on a few stamping sites.  Am interested to know how you fare with the<br/>
gaskets and if the material is suitable.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of questions in regards to stamp carving perhaps one<br/>
of the more veteran carvers could help with:<br/>
<br/>
-  The Mars erasers are so thick, they make the stamp rather bulky.<br/>
Do you par this down, and if so, what is the best way to ensure an<br/>
even trim?<br/>
-  I have been using an Xacto knife for carving.  I like the way it<br/>
handles, but it is difficult to get large white spaces carved<br/>
evenly.  Is there a good tool to use for undercutting large white<br/>
spaces?<br/>
-  What are people's feelings in regards to stamp size?  I see<br/>
several of the new boxes going out have been micro boxes so imagine<br/>
the stamp is quite small to fit.  I recently ran across a box with a<br/>
very large stamp -- as I am using a decent size sketch pad as my<br/>
journal, the image fit, but it would not have fit were a person using<br/>
a small sketch pad as their log.<br/>
--(last one ;-) What are your feelings about alternate materials for<br/>
the stamp?  I ran across a box and the stamp appeared to be made from<br/>
some kind of leading rather than carved from rubber.  It was a<br/>
beautiful stamp which appeared to be handmade, but it did not take<br/>
ink very well and even after several tries, I was not able to get a<br/>
crisp stamp.  It occurred to me later as I cleaned the silver stuff<br/>
off my hands that maybe I wasn't supposed to ink it and the silver<br/>
would make the imprint?  Not sure on this...<br/>
<br/>
An insight is much appreciated!  Thanks!<br/>

 &gt; It's official... I've become obsessive-compulsive about carving<br/>
stamps.  I'm<br/>
 &gt; loving it!<br/>
 &gt; Here's the question...<br/>
 &gt; I have found some pink material made by Speedball - I think it's<br/>
called<br/>
 &gt; Speedy Stamp.  So far, it is my favorite thing to carve in.<br/>
Erasers are<br/>
 &gt; good, but they are slightly too small for me.  The problem with<br/>
Speedy Stamp<br/>
 &gt; is that it is kind of expensive.  $6.00 for a piece that is about<br/>
3x6".<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Has anyone discovered anything cheaper and equally as good?<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; On one stamp carver's website, she suggested using sheets of<br/>
plumber's<br/>
 &gt; gasket.  Does anyone know what this stuff is?  I spent a fruitless<br/>
half hour<br/>
 &gt; wandering the aisles of Home Depot looking for it.  I just could<br/>
not bring<br/>
 &gt; myself to ask the big burly home improvement guys for it for fear<br/>
they would<br/>
 &gt; ask me what I needed for!<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; "Are you doing some plumbing, ma'am?"<br/>
 &gt; "Um... no, I'm carving rubber stamps so I can go hide them in the<br/>
woods.."<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; It was just not a conversation I wanted to have!<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; So, anyways...<br/>
 &gt; Any suggestions would be appreciated!<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Thanks!<br/>
