I thought it was fairly obvious but I made it up so that's easy for <br/>
me to say.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you find it!<br/>
<br/>
And also a warning.... I am a huge Douglas Adams fan so in honor of <br/>
him, a trilogy can have random amounts of items.  If you are keeping <br/>
track the Squirrels Girls series is not only a trilogy of 5 but it is <br/>
also our fourth trilogy.  <br/>
