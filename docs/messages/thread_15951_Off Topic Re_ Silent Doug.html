                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently we hosted Doug at our Kernville residence. Not having met him other than through the chat list, we had no idea what sort of chap we might be getting.Well to our pleasure he was a very pleasant, well mannered, affable gentleman that cleans up well after a dusty, hot hike and likes his scotch on the rocks. After a whirl wind tour of the various Kernville letterboxes , he happily ate the grub we were afixin; he and Gwen shared the same dietary choices. Upon departure, Doug gave us a financial book "The Armchair Millionaire" that he coauthored. Up to that point neither of us had asked much more than "What was the next clue? or where is the next box ?" so his gift and his vocation were a surprise. Within days of his departure, Gwen and I left for a letterboxing junket up the north coast of California and southern coast of Oregon, and I was able to digest his book and compared much of it's content to other financial books. I would suggest that anyone who is at the novice stage of increasing their wealth should run out and buy this book. Much of the strategy used is very basic but extremely effective. I wish that we would have had this book available when we were 20 then we would have retired a lot sooner and would have a higher P &amp; F count. Now this has been a shameless plug (one that he doesn't know is coming), but an important item for some folks-- You get to see what Silent Doug looks like,as his picture is found inside back cover! <br/>
