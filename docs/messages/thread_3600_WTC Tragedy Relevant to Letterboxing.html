mentioned, but I thought I'd share it with you.<br/>
<br/>
 A couple of weeks after September 11th I went hiking with an old <br/>
college girlfriend whom I recently hooked up with after a long time.  <br/>
She's a cancer survivor and wanted an easy hike to start getting back <br/>
into shape.  So I took her up to the Tourne in Morris County, NJ <br/>
where I had found Wingfoot's box this past Spring.  I remembered that <br/>
the clue said to find the lookout bench where the World Trade Center <br/>
could be seen at 110 degrees.  Ironically, the day in May when I <br/>
stamped in was overcast and raining with no view.  I just found the <br/>
lookout that faced generally in that direction and began following <br/>
the clues.  <br/>
<br/>
However, we approached the lookout in a different world this time.  <br/>
All around the bench there were bouqets of Red, White and Blue <br/>
flowers.  On a tree behind the bench someone had nailed a laminated <br/>
photo of the old view showing the WTC with a little writeup about <br/>
it.  Since I was trying to introduce my friend Bonnie to <br/>
letterboxing, I brought her down and showed her the box.  In the <br/>
journal I saw that Kimberly (Martian Maggot) have been there recently <br/>
and she had also written a comment on the flowers when she stamped <br/>
in.   <br/>
<br/>
I found it very moving and wanted to share it with the list.  I'm <br/>
sure that all of those in letterboxing have been touched in one way <br/>
or another by this tragedy and I'm also sure that we're all dealing <br/>
with it and helping out in different ways in our personal lives.  As <br/>
far a this past-time of ours goes, continuing with it is the best way <br/>
that we can send a message to those madmen that they can't disrupt <br/>
our lives!  KEEP ON BOXING!<br/>

I thought I'd share my story as well.  On 9/15 I replaced one of<br/>
the Turkey Mountain letterboxes (Wingfoot's 10th, which will be<br/>
relocated in a new series) with the In Memory letterbox.  It's <br/>
dedicated to all those who were lost on that tragic day.  <br/>
<br/>
I've hiked Turkey Mountain many times, always stopping to admire<br/>
the view from where that that box is now.  I always enjoyed the <br/>
Manhattan skyline and the fact that it's not a well known spot. <br/>
As a matter of fact, before the 15th I had never seen another person <br/>
there.  Anyway, that day, I went to swap the boxes, and there were <br/>
literally a dozen folks there.  Most of us sat in silence and just <br/>
looked out at the cloud of smoke that hovered over the spot where the <br/>
towers had once stood.  It was an experience I won't soon <br/>
forget         <br/>
<br/>
In regards to The Tourne, Kimberly had contacted me off list and told <br/>
me about the flowers.  I know many folks hiked up The Tourne just to <br/>
come to that spot. <br/>
<br/>
I thought about changing the clues for that box, but have decided <br/>
against it.<br/>

                    <html><body>One of the boxes at Pyramid Mountain in Boonton, New Jersey also has a "view" of the Towers.  I was there the end of September and although I didn't have a stamp or book yet, I was able to find the letterbox and write a short note.  There, too, folks had left flowers, flags, and a picture of the Towers pre September 11............ very moving.
<br/>
<br/>I should also take this opportunity to rave about my new favorite pastime.  I expect to go back to Pyramid Mountain soon to stamp my new book with the three there.  Last weekend I was able to bag Bowman's Hill Letterbox (which was no easy feat) and the weekend before Charmed in Merrill Creek.  The second one, Foundations left me somewhat frustrated because I really though I had found the spot where it would be hidden behind the trough, but alas, no letterbox.  ............. will try again one of these days.
<br/>
<br/>Anyway, thanks All, I'll start hiding my own soon.

Dear Forester,<br/>
<br/>
I had my Tangled Woods letterbox all ready for planting the evening <br/>
of September 10, 2001.  All I had to do was write the intro in the <br/>
journal book, which I had planned to do the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
I woke up the next morning to a completely different world.<br/>
<br/>
I planted the Tangled Woods letterbox in the early morning hours of <br/>
September 12, 2001.  My intro in the journal reflected the events of <br/>
the previous day and how it changed the meaning of the box and <br/>
stamp.  Tangled Woods had taken on a new connotation.  Anyone who has <br/>
found this letterbox can attest to this.<br/>
<br/>
I have two more letterboxes in my car, all ready to plant (turns out <br/>
my area of residence is dismally sparse in letterboxes).  The clues <br/>
will be forthcoming in a few weeks' time.<br/>
<br/>
Warrior Woman<br/>
(even my own personal stamp has taken on a greater significance for <br/>
me)<br/>
