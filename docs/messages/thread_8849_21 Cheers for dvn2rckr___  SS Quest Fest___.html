What a great day we had finding 11 of the Quest Fest boxes plus <br/>
a HH to boot!  We were struck by a 'thunderbolt' (our first traveler) <br/>
and survived!  We even were seeing double Kmartha's!  What a <br/>
trip!<br/>
<br/>
Met some famous boxers like Ryan, Amanda from Seattle, <br/>
Hoopoe, Mischief, the Paisley Orca and John, oh, and the <br/>
'infamous' Bill (without Glenn although we found 'evidence' of his <br/>
being there at some point...or another), dvn2rckr, of course, and <br/>
her little ones as well as her parents,...ElizaB, Sunseeker &amp; DZ, <br/>
Fudrick, a recent transplant from the east coast who brought a <br/>
newbie, Cool!  The canada goose and the secret gardners, tea <br/>
time &amp; thunder... I know we're forgetting some but there were <br/>
many terrific boxers to meet and we had lots of fun!<br/>
<br/>
We're tired but it's a good kind of tired, you know?  We got to see <br/>
some great stamps and were inspired with lots of creativity out <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Wish you could have been there.  Sorry you weren't especially <br/>
Funhog and Aryn in Idaho.  There's always next year.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">      You guys are very kind--but actually the success of the event <br/>
is due to everyone who attended!  Thank you for coming, placing <br/>
boxes and 'rearranging' them, too--without that assistance I would <br/>
have been standing in the middle of a major collegiate cross country <br/>
event &amp; soccer stampede with my stamp &amp; log book trying to beat the <br/>
hordes to my 2 boxes in the park!  ;)  <br/>
<br/>
     I think the final count of folks who attended was somewhere <br/>
above 30--I ended up with 24 exchanged stamps and two different <br/>
pairs shared a stamp, I never managed to catch up with Mountain <br/>
Maple's friend Lisa to catch her 'brand spanking new' signature <br/>
stamp (although it looked like a beauty when I saw it in progress) &amp; <br/>
the legendary 'catbird' whom I seem to follow around all over the <br/>
Puget Sound logging into log books just a few days after he does and <br/>
then the person in incognito who attended, too:  All those folks <br/>
plus the four stamps from my family (which I already had) puts the <br/>
total over 30.   What a blast it was!!! THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK <br/>
YOU!!!<br/>
<br/>
     It was really great to finally be able to put faces with <br/>
logbook images/names and such legends of the sport, to boot!  It was <br/>
wild getting to see some of the 'legendary' boxes, too--and the <br/>
incredible works of art from afar (such as the K-Mart(ha)'s and <br/>
Flutterby--the letterbox that finds you).  How honored we are to <br/>
finally get to experience their beauty.<br/>
<br/>
      Finally, I still have several more boxes I need to locate in <br/>
the park.  Even after today's event, I feel I have barely scratched <br/>
the surface there!  Wow--I never knew that park was THAT big!!!  <br/>
Thanks for the adventure through my own backyard!<br/>
<br/>
See you on the trails and thanks for all your help with today's <br/>
event,<br/>
