visiting, and letterboxing "Up North" and "Downeast". Our <br/>
legerdemaine count has now passed our mapsurfer count (both in the <br/>
double digits), and both types, different as they may be, represent <br/>
our absolute most outstanding letterboxing experiences ever!!!<br/>
For a sweet sample of legerdemaine, don't forget that the Flutterby <br/>
will be passing through the Sleeping Giant at the CT Gathering this <br/>
coming Saturday between about noon and 2PM. Since many folks will <br/>
likely be off letterboxing both before and after that time, this <br/>
would probably be the best opportunity to eat lunch, do exchanges, <br/>
and put names into that old cone-shaped straw hat of mine to see who <br/>
gets to go home with the Flutterby and mail it off next! Since I'm <br/>
bringing out that silly old hat and Ben and Laura may be portaging <br/>
down some of their hat collection from Maine,perhaps it would be fun <br/>
for everyone to get into the spirit and put on special hats for the <br/>
occasion! See you there - with or without your butterfly nets!<br/>

I also know that Pete is a very capable engineer (he happens to work <br/>
where I work.) I know that I am very capable of (and so I believe are <br/>
Wanda and Pete) counting accurately.  Although there are no absolute <br/>
certainties in life, I think that there is a high probability of <br/>
getting something as simple as counting correct.  I too keep a <br/>
complete list of every letterbox I have ever been to with location <br/>
and date :) <br/>
