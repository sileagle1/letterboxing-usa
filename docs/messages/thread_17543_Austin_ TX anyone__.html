I don't live near enough to meet you, but there should be<br/>
several letterboxers in the area that can.  You might try<br/>
sending this note to individual placers of boxes in the<br/>
area since I don't think many of them view this Talklist.<br/>
Hope you have time to letterbox the area before you go<br/>
since there are quite a few boxes in the Austin area.<br/>
