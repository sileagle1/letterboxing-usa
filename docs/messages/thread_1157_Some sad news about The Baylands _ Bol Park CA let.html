<br/>
 It's been a very strange summer so I haven't been<br/>
able to participate as much as I'd like... bad manners<br/>
for a newbie, I know:&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 Did find time to go locally to find some letterboxes<br/>
in Bol Park, Palo Alto, CA, and the Baylands (Byxbee<br/>
Park), Palo Alto, CA.<br/>
<br/>
 Box number 3 at the Baylands was destroyed, and it<br/>
looked like recently. We found some contents of the<br/>
box (no stamp though:&lt;) and the lid and put them under<br/>
a rock in what we think may have been the original<br/>
hiding place, but it won't be safe with the upcoming<br/>
rains. Couldn't find number 1 either... but that might<br/>
be because we're bad searchers?;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 In Bol Park, the Pick-Up-Sticks letterbox is GONE,<br/>
probably because the sticks are gone. We'd found it,<br/>
but wanted to "find it" with our daughter so we waited<br/>
for a time she was with us. Went back and it had<br/>
dissapeared!:&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 Is it bad manners for another person to come along<br/>
and replace the boxes, or should the original placer<br/>
do that, or???? New hobby, new etiquette to learn.<br/>
<br/>
 It's been lots of fun, and we're sorting out 3 new<br/>
locations to hide our first boxes by November!<br/>
<br/>
 Also... I was asked to help out with the HTML on the<br/>
new site..I am still willing to do that and I<br/>
apologise for not getting back sooner. It's been<br/>
literally nuts here, but it's calming down now and I<br/>
think I can help now. Sorry about that again.<br/>
<br/>
 Best Wishes to all!<br/>
<br/>
