Bubbles is on a mission! Help Her save the World before Bedtime!! This <br/>
letterbox<br/>
has two matching schoolbox size containers .<br/>
<br/>
This is an awesome park. The creek is awesome ... from a geological point of <br/>
view! AS a matter of fact we saw a Young Paleantology/geologist in search of <br/>
crinoids in the creek banks ("with their Heads!" as he put it.). My Sibling, <br/>
who wishes to remain anonymous and not have his name anywhere attached to a <br/>
PowerPuff Girl, was ready to wade in too until Mom said "no ride home if you <br/>
do!" <br/>

This one will work fine for kids BUT, depending on the season, watch out for <br/>
sticker bushes! Summer may require a machette. <br/>

 As long as you have the clues for the starting point(encrypted below) this <br/>
will be an easy find. [:o)]. After you have figured out your beginnings: <br/>
<br/>
* Bubbles doesn't need a bridge but you will.<br/>
*Turn NE. <br/>
*Follow the faint foot path along the creek bank. <br/>
*Stay close to the bank and out of back yards. <br/>
*Walk East thru the field. <br/>
*Follow the creek bed north and past the large tributaary on the right. <br/>
*Continue until finding the small/steep ravine running down the hill (20 <br/>
strides). <br/>
* Head up ravine then follow the bank southward until reaching the <br/>
outcropping at the large fallen tree. <br/>
*Take 8 strides East and look up the hill. <br/>
*Bubbles is on the east side of a tree on the knoll under rocks, branches &amp; <br/>
sticks. Please carefully replace all the rocks and branches so that the boxes <br/>
are not washed away in a heavy storm AND are hidden from prying eyes! Bring <br/>
gloves for turning over wet, buggy rocks. <br/>

Happy Hunting<br/>
