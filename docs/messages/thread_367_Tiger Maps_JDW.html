&gt;  Well, I know &amp; love maps, but don't know much, or anything, about<br/>
&gt;  the Tiger server (other than it's from the Census Bureau), but<br/>
&gt;  I would love the opportunity to get involved in this aspect.<br/>
&gt;  let me know if I can be of assistance.  I'd love to learn more<br/>
&gt;  about it and to have the opportunity to contribute to the group<br/>
&gt;  effort in this way.<br/>
<br/>
That's really kind of you John, to offer to help.  I noticed you <br/>
have already explored the Tiger Map Server by coming up with a map<br/>
for 1000 Oaks.  What follows is slightly technical, but I'm going<br/>
to risk boring a few people because it may also interest a few<br/>
others.  If you look to this link for Map marks in California<br/>
http://www.pclink.com/elf/camarks.txt<br/>
you will find this text there:<br/>
<br/>
#tms-marker<br/>
#CA<br/>
#http://tiger.census.gov/cgi-bin/mapsurfer?lat=37.2&amp;lon=-120&amp;murl=http://www.pclink.com/elf/camarks.txt&amp;wid=10&amp;ht=10&amp;off=counties,majroads,places,water,miscellt=22<br/>
-122.13935,37.39920:purple4:Bol Park(3)<br/>
-118.92,34.115:purple4:CircleX<br/>
<br/>
The # sign means the line of text is for information only.<br/>
You see a Tiger map link on the 3rd line (less the # sign).<br/>
Within it is a reference to the very text file you are viewing<br/>
which contains lats. &amp; longs. for points in California.<br/>
The web link here brings up the state map for California,<br/>
but you could revise this web link to include say, the <br/>
Western seaboard from Seattle down to San Diego.  The same<br/>
points will still show up in the proper location on the map<br/>
even though neiboring states have been inlcuded on the map.<br/>
Or the map could be narrowed down to a region and the points <br/>
will then show up there (if the region covers the area the <br/>
points are located in).  Whatever points are listed in this<br/>
file will show up on whatever map is generated when the web<br/>
link references this file.  In theory we could have all the<br/>
points in the country listed in one file.  I haven't tried<br/>
this but the effect would be that any point then that is <br/>
anywhere would show up on whatever map is generated within<br/>
our boundaries as long as the area of the map being generated<br/>
covers the area where the point is located.<br/>
<br/>
How's that?  Just enough to get you (or anyone else) interested?<br/>
Its really neat actually, the way this Tiger server works.<br/>
It is a very well designed system with people like us<br/>
in mind.<br/>

I'd also like to help out with the mapping if I can.  I'm no web guru,<br/>
but I like maps in general, be they electronic, USGS topographical, or<br/>
marine depth charts.<br/>
<br/>
It would be very well if we could have all our markers nationwide on<br/>
one Tiger Map file, but I think that what is also needed is some idea<br/>
of where the boxes are on the plain state maps.  (The ones you get<br/>
when you click on an inviting grey state on the main page.)  Those<br/>
maps have that state's boxes, but not the ones in bordering states. <br/>
For instance, the Wisconsin map could easily indicate the presence of<br/>
Rachel's letterbox in Evanston, IL or your Twin Cities letterboxes. <br/>
For a letterboxer in Milwaukee or Eau Claire, they might be more<br/>
willing to make the trip to a closer neighboring state than all the<br/>
way up to my area.  <br/>
