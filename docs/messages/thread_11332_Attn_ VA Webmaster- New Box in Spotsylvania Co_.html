Placed by: BobCat Crew<br/>
Location: Lake Anna State Park<br/>
State: VA<br/>
County: Spotsylvania<br/>
Nearest City: Fredericksburg<br/>
Date Placed: March 18, 2003<br/>
Level of Difficulty: Easy hike. If you make a loop to include the <br/>
Lake Anna Womyn 's "Tombstone" box,the whole distance is probably <br/>
close to 3 miles.<br/>
<br/>
 My mom's favorite bird can be found all over the state of <br/>
Virginia. "Mom's Favorite Bird" letterbox can be found at Lake Anna <br/>
State Park. Find the box to figure out Mom's Favorite Bird! <br/>
<br/>
To get to Lake Anna from I-95, Take the Thornburg exit and head west. <br/>
You will be on Rt. 606 which turns into Rt. 208 at Snell. Go straight <br/>
at the Snell traffic light and stay on Rt. 208. Rt. 208 will make a <br/>
hard left at one point, so watch for the signs. Make a right on Rt. <br/>
601 (Lawyers Rd.). Go down Rt. 601, and the entrance to Lake Anna <br/>
State Park will be on your left.<br/>
<br/>
1. Once in the park, get a map at the contact station. Proceed to the <br/>
Park Office and park in the horse trailer parking lot. The Park <br/>
Office is located on the left at the first intersection that you will <br/>
come to once you enter the park.<br/>
<br/>
2. Facing the front of the Park Office building, look for the <br/>
Sawtooth Trail entrance which will be on your left.<br/>
<br/>
3. Take the Sawtooth Trail to its intersection with the Pigeon Run <br/>
Trail. Take a right and get on the Pigeon Run Trail. There will be a <br/>
sign.<br/>
<br/>
4. Go down the Pigeon Run Trail until you get to the intersection <br/>
with the Gold Hill Trail.<br/>
<br/>
5. At the directional sign for Pigeon Run Trail and Gold Hill Trail, <br/>
continue straight 56 steps on the Pigeon Run Trail.<br/>
<br/>
6. At the end of the 56 steps, look to the right. You will see an <br/>
uprooted, fallen tree about 18 steps in from the path.<br/>
<br/>
7. Go to the tree. Looking down the fallen tree from the root <br/>
end, "Mom's Favorite Bird" is on the woods side of the fallen tree <br/>
where the fallen tree leans on a skinny tree that is on its right. On <br/>
the left side are two trees together.<br/>
<br/>
8. Now you have two options, You can either backtrack to your car, or <br/>
continue on to find the Lake Anna Womyn's "Tombstone" box. <br/>
<br/>
9. To go on to the "Tombstone" box, continue on down the Pigeon Run <br/>
Trail.When it intersects with the Mill Pond Trail, take a left toward <br/>
the lake. Having a map will really help. Figure out where you are in <br/>
the "Tombstone" directions and go find the box. After finding the <br/>
box, take the Mill Pond Trail back to the road. Coming out of the <br/>
woods from the Mill Pond Trail, take a right and walk back to the <br/>
Park Office, where your car is. <br/>
