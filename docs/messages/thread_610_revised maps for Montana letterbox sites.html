<br/>
Attached are two new .gif maps to replace the ones you posted for the Montana letterboxes. I realized recently that while the clue text refers to the Hyalite Creek trail, the map called it the Hyalite Lake trail. The text was correct, so I've revised the maps to minimize confusion. I've also corrected the name of one of the roads leading to the trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
I'll be grateful if you would replace the old maps with these corrected ones.<br/>
<br/>
In late October I'll be driving from Las Vegas to Long Beach and plan to put out a letterbox in Nevada, to put that state on the map. This one will contain a hand-carved stamp.<br/>
<br/>
As mentioned earlier, unless someone else steps forward, around Labor Day I may also put boxes out in the Yellowstone area (Targhee NF in Idaho; Bridger NF in Wyoming) in order to get Idaho and Wyoming on the map before the snow flies and the millennium rolls over. With my five Hyalite Canyon letterboxes, those two would make a Yellowstone NP vacation a tempting one for letterboxers in the summer of 2000.<br/>

&gt;Can you tell us a little about the stamps for Hyalite?  They're beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, LW! I'll pass the compliment along to the artist. He's a buddy of mine who is a Montana State U. graphic designer. The stamp is a stylized view of Hyalite Lake, a small tarn located in a glacial cirque at the head of Hyalite Canyon. As the cluesheet mentions, Hyalite Canyon is said to be the most visited National Forest Recreation Area in Montana. <br/>
<br/>
The artist had never seen Hyalite Lake before designing the stamps, but (call it coincidence or call it deja vu) the little lake on the stamp, as well as the spiky little trees on the mountainsides around it, are almost identical to the real lake and environs. The actual mountains are craggier and obviously the actual sun looks more like a ball of thermonuclear energy than the stylized one on the stamp does.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
The design was conceived as a pencil sketch first, then realized on a Macintosh computer with Adobe Illustrator. The different versions were customized by addition of a sequence number and the name of the related waterfall, and then saved (out of Photoshop, I think) as TIFF files. I took the TIFF files to the local rubber stamp company and they produced the stamps (in less than 24 hours) for about $10 each.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that's the info you wanted.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hi John or Mitch,<br/>
<br/>
During vacation last week we visited Der Mad Stamper land and placed two<br/>
letter boxes on Mt. St. Helens.  This will make it the 2nd and 3rd<br/>
letterboxes there.  The 1st is placed thanks to Cara and Kevin.<br/>
<br/>
Please post these two for me.<br/>
<br/>
Name:  Mt. St. Helens Monitor Peak<br/>
<br/>
remarks no. 2 Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument south face hiking<br/>
trail to the summit.<br/>
When planning this trip please see http://www.fs.fed.us/gpnf/mshnvm/climbing<br/>
and see 1998 climbing brochure.html<br/>
<br/>
clue difficulty:  easy<br/>
terrain difficulty:  very hard<br/>
<br/>
Clue:  From Climber Bivouac you should begin climb by at least 0500 and<br/>
expect 10 miles roundtrip and 9,000 ft vertical.  You can wear good tennis<br/>
shoes with good tread rather than bulky hiking boots.  For us older folks<br/>
please check with a physician for a medical checkup before you make this<br/>
trip.....<br/>
<br/>
Climb up trail until past Monitor Peak and until you come to the first<br/>
seismograph steel structure (it is triangular in structure).  Upon reaching<br/>
structure, face the summit of the volcano and visually pace 20paces and see<br/>
next highest structure of rocks.  The letterbox is hidden under one of the<br/>
rocks.<br/>
<br/>
The 3rd letterbox will follow.. Greg and Ginny (next msg)<br/>
