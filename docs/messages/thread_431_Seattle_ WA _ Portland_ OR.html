&gt; Has anybody seen this?  I thought it was pretty neat.<br/>

Nice to see evidence of some letterboxing activity in the state of <br/>
Washington!!<br/>

&gt; Well, this Sunday I'm going to hunt for my first letterboxes ever...the ones<br/>
&gt;  at [Rock] Creek sound do-able for my first time. I'm getting my stamp all<br/>
&gt;  set up :) Yay!!!  I have an idea as well for the first box that my partner<br/>
&gt;  and I would like to hide, so there will be another for Portland area folks<br/>
&gt;  to find!<br/>
<br/>
This is VERY good news!!!  It's great to have new people out there looking <br/>
for letterboxes, and fantastic that we may soon have another box to look for. <br/>
 I have a feeling that the Pacific Northwest is going to take to letterboxing <br/>
like a Pooh-bear takes to honey!!!  Meanwhile, I guess I'd better get off my <br/>
laurels and get back into the swing... I've put together a half-dozen or so <br/>
letterboxes this winter, and they're just sitting here waiting for me to make <br/>
time to go hide them!!!  Time to dust off my trusty compass and hit the <br/>
trail....<br/>
