                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all.  Wanted to report that last week I found Shark's Tooth alive <br/>
and well in Venice Florida!  As for today...ugh, lots of rain put a <br/>
bit of a damper on our boxing excursions.  The rain finally broke in <br/>
the afternoon, so we headed to Chillicothe to look for the stamps <br/>
there.  Unfortunately, the rain and nightfall hampered our efforts.  <br/>
We did manage to find 'You take the High Road, I'll take the Low <br/>
Road " that was planted by Salamander. Very nice stamp :)  We got up <br/>
to the HIGH flag for GrandView...but couldn't tell which slope <br/>
contained a tree stump, and it was pretty dark.  We will try again, <br/>
hopefully on a nicer day.  My 4 year old really wanted to play at the <br/>
wonderful playground there.<br/>
