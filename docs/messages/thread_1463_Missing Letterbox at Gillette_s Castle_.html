<br/>
Friends of mine and I spent a cold and overcast Sunday afternoon searching <br/>
for the two "Sherlock's Home" letterboxes at Gillette Castle State Park in <br/>
East Haddam, CT. While we found the first box quite easily (and saw two <br/>
beautiful deer during the hike!), the second one was nowhere to be found. We <br/>
looked high and low (mostly low) at the (presumably) correct location but <br/>
came up empty-handed. Given the thoroughness of our search, we could only <br/>
conclude that this box is missing, perhaps uncovered as part of the extensive <br/>
renovation work taking place throughout the park. Has anyone else had better <br/>
luck than us finding this seemingly errant box? I believe this is yet another <br/>
Drew Family letterbox, so perhaps Jay can shed some light on this Holmesian <br/>
mystery!<br/>
<br/>
