I was over at a friend's house, and there was this picture there that looked<br/>
familiar to me.  Suddenly I said "That's COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE!!!"  See, I<br/>
recognised that beautiful picture from your stamp, even though the site was<br/>
halfway across the continent.  She was so impressed, it was funny.<br/>

P.S.- Wisconsin letterboxers must be pretty big Winnie the Pooh fans- "TTFN,"<br/>
and the map idea.  Personally, my favorite was Eeyore.  I don't know how I<br/>
would've gotten past kindergarten without him, and I still pay homage.<br/>
