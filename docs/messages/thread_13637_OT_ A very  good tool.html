&gt; Maybe Randy knows more about this stuff?<br/>
<br/>
I do.  Its nice to know something (or at least pretend to) :-)<br/>
<br/>
Everything that has been said is true, but what hasn't been said, and<br/>
is always my first recommendation -- <br/>
<br/>
* Do not use Outlook.<br/>
<br/>
* Do not use Internet Explorer.<br/>
<br/>
You will have less malware.  Its that simple.  (And I'm not an <br/>
anti-Microsoft person, but reality is reality -- all software has<br/>
security flaws, just as all airlines have "incidents", but I'd <br/>
rather fly Qantas than Aeroflot ...).<br/>
<br/>
After that, books and web sites abound on personal computer security.<br/>
(I'm personally not a big believer in anti-virus software as a solution --<br/>
I think the technological approach is unsophisticated and non-adaptave<br/>
to new threats; it provides a false sense of security; and its existence<br/>
discourages people from learning how to operate a personal computer <br/>
safely before connecting it to the public internet).<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the rather OT post, but it it gets just _one_ person off<br/>
of Outlook, the internet will be a better place for all, and it will<br/>
have been worth it (again, no offense to MS, but I'm not making this<br/>
stuff up). (and besides, I was asked :-))<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe Randy knows more about this stuff?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do.  Its nice to know something (or at least pretend to) :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everything that has been said is true, but what hasn't been <br/>
&gt; said, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is always my first recommendation -- <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Do not use Outlook.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * Do not use Internet Explorer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You will have less malware.  Its that simple.  (And I'm not<br/>
an <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anti-Microsoft person, but reality is reality -- all software <br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; security flaws, just as all airlines have "incidents", but<br/>
I'd <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rather fly Qantas than Aeroflot ...).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After that, books and web sites abound on personal computer <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; security.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I'm personally not a big believer in anti-virus software as<br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; solution --<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think the technological approach is unsophisticated and non-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; adaptave<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to new threats; it provides a false sense of security; and<br/>
its <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; existence<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discourages people from learning how to operate a personal <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; computer <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; safely before connecting it to the public internet).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry for the rather OT post, but it it gets just _one_<br/>
person <br/>
&gt; off<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Outlook, the internet will be a better place for all, and <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been worth it (again, no offense to MS, but I'm not <br/>
&gt; making <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff up). (and besides, I was asked :-))<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
