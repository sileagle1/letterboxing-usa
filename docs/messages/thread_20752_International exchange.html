Hi,<br/>
I am a letterboxer from England and I am looking to exchange personal <br/>
stamps with letterboxers worldwide.  To be exact I am wanting to swap <br/>
the "inked impression" of the stamp and not the stamp itself!<br/>
I already have a collection of over 100 international personal stamps <br/>
and personally owned letterboxes and wish to add to my collection, I <br/>
have been running this "mini-program" for a couple of weeks now and <br/>
have had an extremely promising response, but I would still like to <br/>
exchange with anyone that I haven't already swapped stamps with.<br/>
If anyone is interested in this idea then please do not hesitate to <br/>
contact me either on or off list.<br/>
My email address is ukletterboxer at yahoo dot com<br/>
I look forward to hearing from you.<br/>
Cheers<br/>
The Happy Wanderer<br/>
<br/>
