It was the most excellent NPR broadcast that rekindled my interest in<br/>
letterboxing, and I've been loving everything about it ever since. I had<br/>
first heard about it years earlier from our next door neighbor in England,<br/>
but would never have been inspired to start here in the States without that<br/>
interview with Mr. Thomas J.<br/>
I owe him everything..if I had a Capital One card, it'd be his!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Publicity is such a problem in Letterboxing. In some areas, we could <br/>
use more participants so there's something to find and people to <br/>
hide them. Yet we are terribly afraid of vandals, and worse, <br/>
humorless authorities. <br/>
<br/>
Reporters flatter you into talking to them. You convince yourself <br/>
that they are going to do this with someone, it might as well be <br/>
someone who will get the story straight, like yourself. Then they <br/>
cut out a bunch of the important stuff. I tried to convince them to <br/>
cut out the W House part of it. That was a big mistake. <br/>
<br/>
When the piece aired I was so embarrassed and so scared. The website <br/>
was so busy I couldn't get on. It scared the pants off me. I thought <br/>
the EfBeeEye would be knocking on my door or something and the hobby <br/>
would be rolled up. I was terribly embarrassed by all the noise in <br/>
the background, and by the lack of showing the nature, pastoral feel <br/>
of boxing. <br/>
<br/>
As it was, I created the box, called Radio Days, on the program just <br/>
for the show, in case it was vandalized. It wasn't. It actually did <br/>
not even get much activity. I finally pulled it because of the too <br/>
close, nearby construction. I'll replace it someday when they finish <br/>
the building.  <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it inflated my ego. Deflated it too. It is nice to hear from <br/>
people, good boxers, who got started after it. This egomaniac admits <br/>
to doing other interviews. And hearing from others that those <br/>
interviews got them started. <br/>
<br/>
I got started in boxing after a front page article in the Weekend <br/>
section of the Washington Post. I saw a full color photo of a woman <br/>
running through the woods with a piece of paper in her hand with <br/>
some title about clues or something. I was instantly hooked. I ran <br/>
out the door that night and found one that was just a bike distance <br/>
away. That article had more eyeballs on it than any other article I <br/>
know of other than the Smithsonian. No vandalism that I know of. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't go asking someone to write articles. If you do some <br/>
publicity pick your audience carefully. I wouldn't teach to an <br/>
existing classroom for instance. No captive audiences. You want <br/>
people to come listen because they heard about it and are <br/>
interested. I have heard of Nature centers doing classes. Cool. The <br/>
Postal Museum actually did a class. <br/>
<br/>
Where I live there were so few boxers for a while, that I stopped <br/>
planting for lack of interest. There are some great new folk now. <br/>
Where do you draw the line between no publicity and some? <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile I am personally pretty paranoid. I'd appreciate your not <br/>
bantering my real name about on this public forum just as you would <br/>
not like me to talk about your boxes on the radio. I may ask the <br/>
webmasters to delete those notes, not because of the other content. <br/>
Anybody could figure it out, but no need to make it easy. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to others for their support. Everyone is entitled to their <br/>
opinions. I like the discussion because it keeps people cautious. <br/>
And no flame wars please! Or I'll bring out the Calvin and Hobbes <br/>
story again. <br/>
<br/>
In the end I am somewhat embarassed by the whole thing. Phineas <br/>
loves it of course. Nick thinks it's idiocy. <br/>

Yes, please!   This is one of those issues people are going to disagree <br/>
about.   There are valid issues on both sides, but can we please keep it from <br/>

<br/>
What MissMoon might not realize is that journalists decide to do a story<br/>
*first* and then work to find faces to put on their story *second*. I would<br/>
agree that we shouldn't be calling up our local newspaper and radio stations<br/>
asking them to feature letterboxing in a story, but carefully working with a<br/>
journalist to put the best spin on a story that they are going to do anyway<br/>
is entirely different.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'm very thankful to the brave souls that helped with the Time<br/>
Magazine article a year and a half ago, where I first heard about<br/>
letterboxing. I'm sure they didn't do it for ego.<br/>

I am not sure that it ever was a little secret when several national magazine <br/>
carried articles on letterboxing years ago.<br/>
I also think that people who take letterboxing on as a hobby in the future, <br/>
will be just as respectful as people who are doing it now... it is the people <br/>
who DON'T take it up, or that accidently discover boxes, that will be more <br/>
prone to displacing them. I don't think anyone with a true interest in <br/>
letterboxing, whether they read about it, saw it on TV, or heard about it on the radio or <br/>
through friends would intentionally destroy boxes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We have been asked on several occasions to participate in interviews <br/>
with outside news agencies such as Time and CNN. We have chosen to <br/>
decline as we have a basic, and well placed distrust of the press. I <br/>
think that the efforts to gain more publicity for letterboxing is <br/>
not something that is really needed as the growth of our hobby from <br/>
word of mouth can be a better introduction. While I did not hear the <br/>
NPR program, (I don't lean in their direction politically and don't <br/>
listen to the station), the program would have a very difficult time <br/>
in representing some of the important nuances that a letterboxer <br/>
would or should know.<br/>
Yes there can be some damage done to letterboxing if growth is too <br/>
fast. While Choi thinks that the Time article was great, we recall <br/>
the loss of over 10 letterboxes in the first week after the article <br/>
hit the news stands. I don't want my meaning misconstrued as I'm not <br/>
indicating that Choi was the problem, nor do I believe that current <br/>
letterboxers were the problem. Any article or program will attract <br/>
the letterboxer that tries it a time or two, and could care less <br/>
about rehiding well or being disceet. They are not in it for the <br/>
long haul, but will go out nab a box or two and go on to something <br/>
else. Conversely when someone is brought into our hobby by a friend <br/>
they have many of the nuances explained and will probably stick with <br/>
it. So while the Time article has attracted some great letterboxers, <br/>
it attracted some not so great ones too,and those are the ones that <br/>
can cause damage. This topic has been hashed over a few times but I <br/>
think that while growth is necessary, a slower controlled growth <br/>
would be preferable. If you want to increase letterboxing in your <br/>
area, plant more letterboxes. When we started in 2000 there was but <br/>
14 in California, and we kept planting. It took well over one year <br/>
for some of our boxes to get visited, but eventually others joined <br/>
in.I don't have a clue but I would probably guess there is 1500+ in <br/>
California now(no we didn't plant that many). Being interviewed for <br/>
an articles isn't necessary, but instead bring a friend into <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>

we <br/>
don't have something like that in this country."  A few years later I heard the NPR piece and <br/>
it <br/>
lighted the flame.  I am grateful to Scarab for doing it and being wise enough to try and <br/>
control - as best one can with the media - the information.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any proof, but I'll wager dollars to donuts that for every Vandal or Box Bungler <br/>
resulting from the NPR piece you got 20 good 'Boxers whose 'boxes we all continue to <br/>
enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
BTW I was fortunate enough to find the Radio Days box before it was pulled.  I found it on <br/>
a <br/>
very hot, humid summer night in DC.  And to highlight the hazzards of urban night <br/>
'boxing, I <br/>
blindly reached into the aforementioned hedge to retrieve the box and came up with a <br/>
plastic <br/>
bag full the foulest smelling dirty diapers in the known world.<br/>
<br/>
I love the excitement in Linda Wertheimer's voice when she finds the 'box.  I think we all <br/>
know what that feels like.  It's great to hear it from a somewhat jaded Noxer.<br/>

<br/>
One of the biggest vandals (when he's not sitting in jail for his fun) is a<br/>
42 year old "boy" from the Chicago area who listens to NPR frequently.  And<br/>
so do his buddies.  Probably the only reason he hasn't gotten a thrill out<br/>
of taking out a few letterboxes is because he must have missed that<br/>
particular blurb when it aired.  He's also very active in Ohio when he's not<br/>
sitting in Metro in Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
The two things that distressed me about the blurb, and this may well not be<br/>
the letterboxer's fault, is that discretion when finding boxes wasn't<br/>
stressed nearly enough, and the fact that common sense has to be used when<br/>
finding planting places to plant wasn't stressed nearly enough.  I realize<br/>
that such pieces can be highly edited, and there lies the<br/>
damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't problem.<br/>
<br/>
I just went to pick up two of my boxes to retire them for the winter and<br/>
replant again next spring.  They were both in very easy almost drive-by<br/>
places, but the "challenge" to them was the fact that they were in very<br/>
public places and it might take either returning a few times or creating a<br/>
nice diversion to be able to both nab them and return them safely.  Totally<br/>
hidden from view and impossible to find "accidentally".  Thanks to either<br/>
sloppy finders or out-and-out vandals, they were both gone when I got there<br/>
to retrieve them this weekend.  The fact that both disappeared during the<br/>
same week also tells me that it wasn't "accidental."<br/>
<br/>
Many boxers will say that they want boxes in easier-to-reach places so that<br/>
boxers who are handicapped or boxers with young children can join in, but I<br/>
sure haven't had much success in trying to do that.  Another one of my<br/>
really great urban hiding places was stolen by a geocacher after a<br/>
letterboxer/geocacher found the box.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I wish the growth of the sport/hobby/game/pasttime/etc was a bit slower<br/>
in my area.  Quite a bit slower.<br/>

<br/>
The debate on the growth of letterboxing has had many rounds, and this particular issue <br/>
has been the focus of several of those. To use an analogy, if you want to stunt the growth <br/>
of a potted houseplant, you can restrict its watering and feeding and lengthen the time in <br/>
spends in a pot of a certain size. To stunt the growth of letterboxing in your area, you <br/>
could:<br/>
- retire your letterboxes (under the assumption that if there's nothing to find then nobody <br/>
will bother)<br/>
- pull the clues from all internet sites and make them word-of-mouth<br/>
- leave the boxes listed but have potential finders contact you via email to receive the <br/>
clues (at which point you will have the opportunity to remind them of Finding Etiquette)<br/>
- or change the clues to make them harder to solve<br/>

I have always felt that anyone who becomes interested in <br/>
letterboxing is going to be the same people who are interested in <br/>
camping, trailhiking, and being outdoors.  When I discuss my hobby <br/>
with someone, I start out talking about trail hiking.  When their <br/>
eyes glaze over and the state that they hate being out doors with <br/>
all those icky bugs and snakes, I know they are not potential <br/>
letterboxers.  When they begin to talk about their camping trips and <br/>
trail hikes, I know I have found someone who has a love of outdoors <br/>
and nauture and the hobby would help compliment their outdoor <br/>
experience.  I reside in NE Ohio and to date there are not may <br/>
boxers in my area.  I'm always happy if i get someone else <br/>
interested in the hobby.  Then it makes planting my boxes worth <br/>
while.  Am I selective about who I discuss the hobby with? Yes. Do I <br/>
keep it a total secret, NO.  If it was kept a total secret then none <br/>
of us would have discovered the hobby that has enriched our lives so <br/>
much.  The Cat's Meow<br/>
