weekend jam-packed full of letterboxing madness and mayhem to help <br/>
celebrate the ten year anniversary of our beloved hobby! <br/>

We will be frolicking in the forest along the shores of the Sandy <br/>
River at Camp Namanu, a 552-acre outdoor residential camp located one <br/>
hour east of Portland, Oregon, on the shoulder of majestic Mount <br/>
Hood. This is going to be a letterboxing retreat unlike anything <br/>
you've ever experienced before! <br/>
<br/>
All ages are welcome, and we're planning to organize everything... <br/>
food, cabins, entertainment, and an amazing variety of letterboxes! <br/>
All you need to bring is your sleeping bag, your letterboxing gear <br/>
and your sense of adventure as we revel in the past, look forward to <br/>
the future, and party 'til the needles fall off our compasses! <br/>
<br/>
Mark your calendars now for our tentative date of September 19-21, <br/>
2008. Stay tuned to our website <br/>
(http://www.mitchklink.com/letterboxing/retreat) for costs, <br/>
reservation information and additional details as they develop. <br/>

We promise this is a celebration you won't want to miss!<br/>
