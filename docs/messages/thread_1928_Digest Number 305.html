&gt; <br/>
&gt; The new hitchhiker that I planted was a BDay gift from friends, to my<br/>
&gt; daughter. I could have taken it out and found it a permanent home<br/>
&gt; nearby so Renee and I could periodically check on it, but another<br/>
&gt; gift, given to my daughter, by the same friends at Christmas time has<br/>
&gt; already been planted in that manner. (See Gift to Renee) I really<br/>
&gt; couldn't see two such boxes in the same area, so I decided to make<br/>
&gt; this a Hitchhiker. Inside the journal of this hitchhiker is a note to<br/>
&gt; those finding it. It is my hope the one of you finding it after it's<br/>
&gt; been in circulation for awhile would mail it back to Renee, so she<br/>
&gt; could see who has left her BDay wishes. Perhaps the solution to the<br/>
&gt; problem of over populating hitch hikers is to give them a time limit<br/>
&gt; where after the limit is reached the next finder of such box could<br/>
&gt; send it to it's owner. That way the owner could see where it's been<br/>
&gt; and we wouldn't need the hitch hiker page to keep track off them.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Don't come down for too long, Squirrel.  You have great points to<br/>

&gt; inspiration.  Your York River #2 box was my first found, so for me<br/>
&gt; that one will always hold a certain excitement.  I remember you told<br/>
&gt; me how special York River #1 was to you, and I'm sorry I never got to<br/>
&gt; see it.  Your advice to try to place more than one in a location has<br/>
&gt; always stuck with me.  Had you not done that at York River, I'd have<br/>
&gt; had a very disappointed Katybug with me!  I try to keep that in mind<br/>
&gt; when I'm planting boxes.  I'm hoping for some time this long weekend<br/>
&gt; to get north to add a few more of yours and the G Man's to my<br/>

&gt; Well said.  I, for one, get more joy out of trying to solve, and find<br/>
&gt; (or never find :-)) _one_ mystery box, than collecting 10 "drive-by"<br/>
&gt; stamps.  On the other hand, I'm also thankful for these easier boxes<br/>
&gt; for when I'm out with the kids.  I do believe there can never be<br/>
&gt; enough mystery boxes.  (Most, I think, boxes on Dartmoor we would<br/>
&gt; consider mystery boxes, and there are tens of thousands of them, and<br/>
&gt; we have a huge nation to work with...)  There are several boxes I've<br/>
&gt; been working on (not regularly, but once in a while) for almost 2<br/>
&gt; years now, and when I find one of those, it'll be worth more to me<br/>
&gt; than many of the easier ones.  And I also know there are some I'll<br/>
&gt; never find, but I'm having fun trying to solve the clues anyway...<br/>

&gt; Here, Here. Valerie this is why I decided not to keep track of my own HHs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BUT.   I don't agree on the earlier comments regarding Mystery boxes. I wouldn't group them with HHs. I feel like they are more the essence of the game then the hitchhikers. Maybe it is just sour grapes on our part for not being able to figure out Randy's clue.... ha!ha!  TIC  (tongue in cheek)<br/>

&gt; There is nothing ordinary about Valentines Day! explained Randall to his<br/>
&gt; darling.  To rejoice this year, love, Ive hidden a valentine for you to<br/>
&gt; find.  After our hearty dinner of tender Nantucket scallops and saged duck,<br/>
&gt; well ride a ways up the main road, to the northwest, then head south at the<br/>
&gt; rocky hollow there near the pond.  Not far along, on the right near the<br/>
&gt; courts, is a lovely place for a picnicanother day.  Id love for you to<br/>
&gt; stop in the southwest cornertheres a fieldstone wall and a large tree.<br/>
&gt; Ive tucked your Valentine low in the wall seven paces west of that tree.<br/>
&gt; Replace it gently and we shall visit it for years to come.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I agree--hitchhikers are one thing and mystery boxes are quite<br/>
&gt; another. I'm with you -I believe that mystery boxes are a<br/>
&gt; fundamental, even essential - part of the game. My comments and<br/>
&gt; concerns regarding proliferation was really about hitchhikers, not<br/>
&gt; mystery boxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm currently working on one of Randy's wonderful mysteries right<br/>
&gt; now. And if I solve it, I'd love to brag openly about it. But,<br/>
&gt; Webster's defines the word "decorum" as: "the conventions of polite<br/>
&gt; behavior."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if and when I solve that mystery box, I'll be quiet about it,<br/>
&gt; though it will probably take decorum, discretion, AND duct tape.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Howdy Folks!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of you all East of the Rockies have a bit of an analysis paralysis over<br/>
&gt; this hitchhiker/travelling box etiquette rules and regulations stuff.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; I'm just so fresh at this I can't help get excited and bubble over in<br/>
&gt; e-mails.  This can't be a solemn, silent sport for me!  I've got too much<br/>
&gt; enthusiasm for it. Since I've gotten involved in this hobby I have yet to<br/>
&gt; snag a hitchhiker and I'll be SO PUMPED when I do!  Out here in the Wild,<br/>
&gt; Wild West I don't think they come so easy as every five minutes in<br/>
&gt; Connecticut.  At least not so far.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway...I don't know about mystery boxes.  I suspect Mapsurfer's finds are<br/>
&gt; true treasures because the clues are probably cryptic and take some thinking<br/>
&gt; and skill.  The boxes I've put out there are about as obvious as the nose on<br/>
&gt; your face.  Some would say that's not very challenging, but I'm as bad as a<br/>
&gt; kid and I get kind of disappointed if I don't find what I'm hunting for, and<br/>
&gt; for that reason my boxes are probably not much of a thrill for real<br/>
&gt; letterboxing "purists".  I'm getting better at carving the images, though,<br/>
&gt; so there's your incentive, I hope!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When it comes to letterboxing I can't get too technical or detail-oriented.<br/>
&gt; I just want to have a good time.  That's what it's all about for me and I'd<br/>
&gt; like it to be that way for others I introduce this cool hobby to!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best regards,<br/>

&gt; Subject: Re: Excitment about unsuual finds: Keep them coming...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally I say put whatever out there...  I love solving a good mystery<br/>
&gt; as much as I love to go out on a "simple" letterbox.  Each has their own<br/>
&gt; distinct quality.  Every letterbox is placed in a beautiful location for a<br/>
&gt; hike or view.  And I have been more amazed as to the ingenuity and artwork<br/>
&gt; that has been apearing since I first began.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can personally attest to spending a year (of my spare time of course)<br/>
&gt; trying to figure out some of Randy's awesome clues.  In fact I have been<br/>
&gt; learning some history along the way that I would have never looked up<br/>
&gt; prior to trying to decifer some the great mystery clues. Damn inferior<br/>
&gt; high school educational history course that I took!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And clearly now that the hobby is starting to take off, you can find just<br/>
&gt; about find any kind of letterbox within a short drive here in New England.<br/>
&gt; And I am sure it will be the same across the country within a short amount<br/>
&gt; of time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I like writing good challenging clues as much as I like solving them.<br/>
&gt; However, I equally enjoy detailed walk throughs (otherwise I will never<br/>
&gt; find more than a handful. And besides I need some stamps to include in my<br/>
&gt; logbook other than my own artwork.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So in closing, IMHO place whatever kind of box you like out there.  I am<br/>
&gt; sure that most people will be glad when they find it.  Variety is the<br/>
&gt; spice of life. My only request is to indicate with your clues how<br/>
&gt; difficult you think it is (Terrain and Clue Decifering).  This way you<br/>
&gt; can plan your time and include youngones accordingly.  And if you drive<br/>
&gt; 100 miles to find a difficult one and come up empty handed, that was what<br/>
&gt; you were expected for such a good challenge.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If GB can place tens of thousands of boxes at Dartmoor, clearly there<br/>
&gt; is more than enough space in the entire North America for a few more<br/>
&gt; mystery, hitchhiker boxes, or whatever letterboxes.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, so my opinion about hitchhiker boxes is clearly unpopular and I<br/>
&gt; got clobbered for it. Well now there is another thing - an idea -<br/>
&gt; that's been on my mind lately. I could get REALLY slammed by the<br/>
&gt; group for this one. So, with much trepidation, here goes:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most of you are aware that southeast CT is not only beautiful, but it<br/>
&gt; is letterbox HEAVEN. I live in Ledyard, a very high letterbox-density<br/>
&gt; area. There are about 50+ boxes within 30 minutes of my home; many<br/>
&gt; are much closer. Most boxes in Rhode Island are within 45 minutes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd like to offer some hospitality to the members of the letterboxing<br/>
&gt; community and open my home to weary 'boxers for a night or two. I<br/>
&gt; know the cost of lodging and that is where my "cheap streak" lies.<br/>
&gt; (Think of all the other cool stuff you could do if you didn't have to<br/>
&gt; lay out the cash for a hotel room.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband and I would love to go out to Oregon for the April<br/>
&gt; gathering, but ooohh I hate paying for a hotel room for the whole<br/>
&gt; stay. Is there anyone from Portland with a spare room who would be<br/>
&gt; interested in "putting us up" for a few nights at the end of April??<br/>
&gt; Come to CT sometime and you've got a free place to stay, too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If someone would like to explore the possibilities of this (OFF-<br/>
&gt; LIST), please e-mail me.<br/>

&gt; Steve,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Glad to hear you like the scroll page graphics.  Feel free to use this page<br/>
&gt; for your own clues.  However, this particular page is not just one GIF<br/>
&gt; image... the best way to incorporate it is to copy the code for the entire<br/>
&gt; page and then modify it by replacing the text with your clues.  The code has<br/>
&gt; been written to pull the proper images from the LbNA site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps the most convenient page to use as a template is the "Submit Clues"<br/>
&gt; page at http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/inform.htm<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In most browsers, you can right-click on the page to access a menu of choices<br/>
&gt; that includes "view page source" or something similar.  Then just copy and<br/>
&gt; paste the code into a blank text file, and save it with the extension HTM.<br/>
&gt; (Text editors such as Notepad or Simple Text are perfect for working with<br/>
&gt; text files.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, using your text editor (or your favorite webpage editor) delete the<br/>
&gt; original text and insert your clues.  You do not have to have the actual<br/>
&gt; images on your server for it to display properly... the graphics will be<br/>
&gt; pulled down from the LbNA site when you view your page.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; Thanks Mr. Stamper<br/>
&gt; Wasn't sure if I was going to be able to follow those instructions;<br/>
&gt; due to my lack of web knowledge but bamm......  It work and looks<br/>
&gt; great now that my clues look the look time to get back placing some<br/>
&gt; more boxes. I have five stamps carved just need to find the time to<br/>
&gt; place them. Thanks again.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You do not have to have the actual images on your server for it to display<br/>
&gt; &gt; properly... the graphics will be pulled down from the LbNA site when you<br/>
&gt; &gt; view your page.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do not do this.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Save these images to your server if you wish to use them (and you have<br/>
&gt; permission, as you evidently do).  Linking to images on a third party<br/>
&gt; server (in this case the provider for letterboxing.org), is bandwidth<br/>
&gt; theft, and in particular is explicitly against the AUP of the LbNA<br/>
&gt; provider.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry for another "etiquette" post, but this is actually an important<br/>
&gt; issue on the 'net.  Prolly not a big deal if just you do this, but the<br/>
&gt; provider _will_ notice if lots of people start linking to images on<br/>
&gt; their server, and using their bandwidth (and its the principal of it ...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cheers,<br/>

&gt; Can't wait to look for this one!<br/>

I have been silent for a while, and not reading the<br/>
digest most of that time, life, winter and the<br/>
holidays tend to stop the fun at times.  Well I am<br/>
back, and single (no more Jen and Stan boxes) but I<br/>
still want to put another box on Block Island.  Think<br/>
it would be cool to have a Glacial island series, or<br/>
is that a bit of a strech?!?!<br/>
Anyhow, it sounds like alot has happened, patches,<br/>
decals and the like!  <br/>
My point was just to say hi to everyone and I look<br/>
forward to doing some Boxin' this year.<br/>
<br/>
Take it easy:<br/>

    Just wanted to mention that Block is a favorite of ours, too.  We have<br/>
made up three boxes to add to the one you put there, one for the North<br/>
Light, another for the Southeast Light and one for the Indian Cemetery.<br/>
Hope our plans don't collide with yours.  Will be posting clues for ours as<br/>
soon as we get out there, probably around Memorial Day or so. Have to wait<br/>
for sailing season.  Ann T.<br/>
