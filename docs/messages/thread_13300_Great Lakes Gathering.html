messages in my in bin! I haven't had time to read them, but did take some<br/>
time to search through the messages for the comments about the gathering. I<br/>
knew there would be rave reviews and I have to agree with them! What a<br/>
Fantastic gathering! I wish I had more time to do some of the same things<br/>
for the gathering here in Ohio, but this week is going to be crazy and I<br/>
don't think the next will be much more calm. I loved to see the photos &amp; I'm<br/>
amazed that you were able to get them up so soon! Deb you are amazing &amp; tell<br/>
Old Shoe I did notice his quiet, behind the scenes help and it was<br/>
appreciated :-)<br/>
You set the bar high, thanks so much for all you did! Thank you to everyone<br/>
else who was there to exchange, brave the cold, teach us all a thing or two,<br/>
and to warm us with their presence. I had a great time. I think I found all<br/>
the boxes &amp; HH, since I stayed to box on Sunday before heading back to S.E.<br/>
Indiana. Now I just have to find the time to read the digests and get my log<br/>
books organized :-)<br/>
