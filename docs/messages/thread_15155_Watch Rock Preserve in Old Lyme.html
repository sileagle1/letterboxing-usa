those boxes are Jay Drews . May I ask if you looked for Whimsy Village  <br/>
?[ which is mine.and was just checked a short while ago.] At that time, <br/>
the Pine Bench was there.  I will check them all out next week and tell <br/>
you. In the meantime perhaps Jay might answer too.<br/>

the big list that we found the Whimsy Walk boxes and B'Fly's add on <br/>
back on June 11, 2003. All were in good shape. All were not where we <br/>
first had a "hunch" about.   If need be, I can go run through and <br/>
check them.... but I will not be able to get there until Thursday.<br/>
