Wanda's still boxing up a storm out there in Texas, and has collected a couple <br/>
hundred boxes since that Rodeo Event  last weekend in Brazos Bend.  She'll <br/>
probably be reaching F7000 sometime while I'm out there with her in the next few <br/>
days.  In the meantime, though, before I could get any boxes to plant out to her, she <br/>
must have gotten awfully desperate to plant something, because she just planted a <br/>
hitchhiker all by itself!  I hope someone out there will rescue this homeless hitcher <br/>
soon, and perhaps plant a more permanent home in its temporary resting place.<br/>
<br/>
The hitcher is in the northern part of Panna Maria cemetery in the historic little <br/>
Texas town of that same name, founded by Polish immigrants in 1854 along Bahia <br/>
Trail between San Antonio and Goliad.  Look for a statue of a little girl (age 4 and 1/<br/>
2) under a Live Oak tree.  On the north side of the nearby cedar to the south, find <br/>
Harriet tucked into a little nest at about the height Elzbieta might have reached.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to letterboxing in TX and OK myself.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
