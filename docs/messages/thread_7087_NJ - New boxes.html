four. The standard disclaimer applies.<br/>
Aud (for the family)<br/>
<br/>
1. "The Place"<br/>
A Mystery Box<br/>
State: New Jersey<br/>
Placed August 19, 2002 by the Cahillys of Dumont<br/>
Clue:<br/>
He called it "The Place". He lived there with his collies, and in <br/>
1919 began to put their adventures into books, which remain popular <br/>
to this day. Although the land around the Place is not quite <br/>
the "North Jersey hinterland" anymore, the lake remains, and a park <br/>
now preserves the memory of the man and his dogs.<br/>
<br/>
Begin just to the south of the parking lot, at the grave of the first <br/>
collie to live here, subject of the first book. Proceed at 160 <br/>
degrees up the hill, to the headstone of the faultless friend. Take <br/>
the first letter of his name. Behind the grave is a path. Turn left <br/>
on it and to to the stone pillar. It was dedicated on someone's 100th <br/>
birthday. Take the second letter of his name. Head toward the <br/>
springhouse and stop at Champion Rock. Among the graves there is that <br/>
of the first dog's mate. Take the second letter of her name. (You DID <br/>
read the book, didn't you?) Head north to the edge of the lawn and <br/>
find the two graves of the later arrivals. Take the second letter of <br/>
the name of either. Not far from you now, a dog is buried whose name <br/>
you find with the four letters you've taken. From there, go 130 <br/>
degrees to the base of a fallen tree. The box is in a hollow on the <br/>
far side.<br/>
<br/>
2. A Day in the Park Series (4)<br/>
<br/>
Placed August 20, 2002 by the Cahillys of Dumont<br/>
State: New Jersey<br/>
County: Bergen<br/>
Admission: Fees for Choo Choo, Phony Ponies and Clip-Clop (open in <br/>
season). Critter Collection is free M-Th and in the off-season. Choo <br/>
Choo closed Mondays. (You need the Choo Choo and Critter Collection <br/>
to complete the clues.)<br/>
Difficulty: Easy, just a lot of busy-work.<br/>
Notes: Not all areas are pooch-accessible, so maybe Fido should stay <br/>
home, unless a member of your party is willing to wait around holding <br/>
the leash. These are the suburbs, not pristine wilderness, so watch <br/>
out for glass.<br/>
Clues:<br/>
These boxes are located in the park known as the "Crown Jewel" of the <br/>
county system. Kids love it. Start your visit at the station.<br/>

Just keep looking side to side."<br/>

Enough of phony ponies? Stroll over to where the live ones walk.<br/>
Clip-Clop Letterbox<br/>
Look 143 degrees from the ticket booth. History happened (they say) <br/>
under those trees beyond the field, in an area now surrounded by <br/>
split rail fence. Wander around the field counter-clockwise to see. <br/>
(You'll have to cross the stream with the cars on the right) Enjoy <br/>
the historical tidbit, then look under the arched bridge.<br/>
Choo-Choo Letterbox<br/>
Enjoy a snack at the caf,<br/>
Sight 286 degrees and walk away.<br/>
Turn a)_____ at the brick path.<br/>
