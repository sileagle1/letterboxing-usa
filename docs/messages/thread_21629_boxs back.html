Hello<br/>
I got off work this last week and i was able to return the stamps i <br/>
collected. I hope i got them all back right and they all have baggies <br/>
in the boxes.I had some extra time so i visited my aunty in portland <br/>
and got some boxes there too. I didn't take any of the stamps or <br/>
anything. Does anyone gecache as well as letterbox. How come nobody <br/>
likes the new colors i think they are pretty. I have not tried to tell <br/>
people about there neat lettrboxes should i do that here or <br/>
not.GEOgeorgia<br/>

We letterbox &amp; geocache but I've got an extra-special place in my heart <br/>
for letterboxing.  We geocache (sans GPS) in parts of the world that <br/>
don't have letterboxes.<br/>

 Well i like letterboxing better because i don't need to go with my <br/>
friend that has the direction box.and i don't have to keep reading him <br/>
numbers. I found a direction compass and it works good for the <br/>
letterboxes that i have found. I don't know if i am working it right <br/>
but it is good to just go where the pointer goes.geogeorgia &gt; <br/>
