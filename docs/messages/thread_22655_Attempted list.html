Would it be possible to list more than one 'attempt'<br/>
(3 would be nice) and maybe 3 'founds' on a LB page,<br/>
instead of the current one attempt/found? If I saw<br/>
that there was 3 attempts and no finds, then I<br/>
personally would not bother to look for it, especially<br/>
if the owner doesn't respond to my enquiries  about<br/>
whether the box is there or not.  <br/>
<br/>
I've had people enquire about a box that's somewhat<br/>
near one of mine, asking if it really is missing (I<br/>
found it soon after it was posted in Sep 2004). They<br/>
can't get the owner to respond to their email so they<br/>
write to me. I've checked and the box is definitely<br/>
missing but I can't put a note on the letterbox page<br/>
because it's not mine. I see only one attempt on the<br/>
page when I know that at least 3 people have tried to<br/>
find it. I would put another LB at the spot but it's a<br/>
bad hiding spot (decidous bush in the middle of a busy<br/>
park - after the leaves fall off in the autumn the box<br/>
would be completely exposed). <br/>
<br/>
How do we let people know that a box that doesn't<br/>
belong to us is really gone? <br/>

Here's my thought ... yes, there are boxes I have attempted not once, not<br/>
twice, but sometimes 3 and 4 times before finding them.  I don't give up<br/>
easily, but at some point I would ask myself, how important is it to get<br/>
EVERY letterbox?  Getting a reponse from the placer isn't a priority for<br/>
me.  I also think sometimes the activity is about the journey and not the<br/>
prize (stamp).  If I don't want to see "attempted" in my list of unfound<br/>
boxes, I will choose to ignore that box when I decide I no longer want to<br/>
find it.  <br/>
<br/>
I would like to see an pull-down option for placers to mark the<br/>
letterboxes as "NA/not available" when they are confirmed missing or<br/>
retired.  And for finders the option of hide/show these NA boxes.  As I<br/>
read through some other areas I plan to visit, I see so many confirmed<br/>
missing and reported missing boxes that it might be nice to make a shorter<br/>
list to start with.  But that is only my wish.  I have no idea how easy or<br/>
difficult that would be for our wonderful webmasters.<br/>

The problem with not looking for a box that has had three attempts <br/>
listed and no finds is that you are relying on the capabilities of <br/>
those three searchers. We have had folks contact us about some of our <br/>
boxes and advise us it was "missing" only to receive a note later that <br/>
the box was in place. Obviously the "missing" reports were "could not <br/>
find reports" from someone that couldn't figure out the clues. So if <br/>
there was a function to list more attempts, then another function <br/>
could be added that would allow the "Placer" to list that the box <br/>
isn't missing, but merely that the searcher was not capable of finding <br/>
the box. <br/>
<br/>
We always appreciate any notes from finders and try to respond to each <br/>
of them even if it is just a thank you for your note.<br/>

Great suggestions!<br/>
<br/>
I just went out for 3 Letterboxes, and the missing one took longer than <br/>
the other two combined.  It was also in an extreme high risk area for <br/>
EEE, Eastern Equine Encephalitis, which has killed 4 people near here <br/>
recently.  I just posted about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I did not know everyone had been failing to find this Lb since I was <br/>
redirected to a webpage &amp; the information was not there.  Maybe we need <br/>
to address that problem while we are at it?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think this is a great point-many of my "attempteds" are indeed "could not<br/>
find" and usually because *I * could not find them-was unwilling to venture<br/>
into the underbrush, or had trouble finding a particular landmark.  User<br/>
errors so to speak, certainly not missing boxes or poor clues.  I was<br/>
marking these at attempted for my personal use-to remind me I had looked for<br/>
a particular box.  I have stopped entering this option, simply because I<br/>
don't want to negatively influence others.   For times that I might want to<br/>
be more certain a box is still in place, I find contacting the placer before<br/>
hand to be a mighty fine way of  learning about the area and getting to know<br/>
other boxer.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think contacting the placer is a better way to go.  I regret that I am not<br/>
more consistent about using it, and will try to do so more often.  Honestly,<br/>
unless I have asked a specific question, I don't expect a reply, although it<br/>
is always nice.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I like the new features and think they are useful in many ways.  I also<br/>
understand the frustrations associated with them, and try to use the<br/>
information judiciously.    Hats off to the webmasters who are doing a<br/>
fantastic job of tailoring the site to everyone's needs.<br/>
