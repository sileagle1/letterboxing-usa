                    <div class="plaintext-content">Team Weems planted two new boxes this afternoon.  Valley Falls is one <br/>
of our favorite places.  On hot summer days, we can be found walking <br/>
through the stream with friends (with our old sneakers on, splashing <br/>
away!)  We must look strange to other hikers, but try it.  It's a <br/>
blast!  While trying to de-stress, the Mighty Mommy closes her eyes <br/>
and pictures the babbling steam and peaceful pond and instantly <br/>
relaxes.  This is such a nice park, we want to share it with <br/>
everybody.  We hope you like it as much as we do.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Should take just under an hour to do both boxes.  <br/>
Mostly flat, except for one large hill (with stairs!)<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From I-84 West, take exit 66. Take a left off the exit, <br/>
then left onto Tunnel Road. Take a left onto Valley Falls Road.  <br/>
Valley Falls Park will be on your right.<br/>
