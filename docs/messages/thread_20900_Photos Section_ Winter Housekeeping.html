The recent additions of the MMM pictures really sapped the space <br/>
available in the photos section of the list. We removed many of the <br/>
older pictures that were lurking in the depths of the archive. Most <br/>
are saved on our own personal web space...either email us if you need <br/>
a copy or if you are yahoo savy try viewing the photos under our <br/>
yahoo account (stephenholyfield@sbcglobal.net).  <br/>
<br/>
We'll keep the copies till the first part of 05 just in case.....<br/>
<br/>
We've broadcast messages about space being limited and valuable so <br/>
this should not come as a suprise. There's about 10meg free now (66% <br/>
used) so feel free to add photos; just try to remove them after a few <br/>
months so others can enjoy them too!<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in personal web hosting, feel free to try it <br/>
out. You can certainly place a link to your own web hosting in <br/>
the "links" section and we've already created a "Links to Photos" <br/>
folder for such links!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and now back to your regular program joined already in <br/>
progress........<br/>

I understand that the photos section was totally overloaded with some dusty old stuff. <br/>
However, it seems to me that some of the files that were there are relevant to the <br/>
history of letterboxing. It would be a pity for them to be forever nuked. I am hoping <br/>
that you find a way to preserve those of historic interest. Funhog<br/>

Another suggestion for the photos section: Try <br/>
to keep the file size of each photo as small as<br/>
possible when posting. It makes a huge difference <br/>
in how many photos we're allowed to host if photos <br/>
are 100KB vs 1000KB. If you can get by with <br/>
posting a smaller image, please do so. Some images <br/>
are better served by having a larger size available <br/>
(like a group shot, where it helps to have a larger <br/>
picture so you can see everyone's faces), but for <br/>
many photos a smaller one will do and smaller file <br/>
size will allow more photos to be posted without <br/>
having to remove others.<br/>
<br/>
Just something to think about.<br/>

Looks like our good samartian effort opened Pandora's box. I guess I <br/>
will have to now find time to sort out which files are of "historical <br/>
significance". Perhaps we'll just crop everything down a bit and put <br/>
it all back. Its actually kind of amazing that the group filled 30 <br/>
megabytes to the brim. Unfortunately getting more space would cost <br/>
$$$; something I doubt anyone wants to foot the bill for. <br/>

Here's a neat trick you can use to "trim" those photo files... <br/>
without cropping off so much as a pixel!<br/>
<br/>
If you have PhotoShop, there's an option under the File menu for <br/>
either "Save Optimized As..." or "Save for Web...". Either one will <br/>
get you to a similar point at which you can view the image in two <br/>
states: untouched and "optimized".<br/>
<br/>
The procedure will remove certain colors, remove certain pixels, <br/>
etc. etc., but only as much as you allow. The other neat thing about <br/>
this method: when the file is saved, it's saved without all (or <br/>
most) of this stuff:<br/>
- thumbnail for Macs<br/>
- thumbnail for Windows<br/>
- icon for Mac<br/>
- icon for Windows<br/>
- preview for Mac<br/>
- preview for Windows<br/>
<br/>
It makes for a nice, trim file. I use this extensively when <br/>
designing web pages!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS-You might also consider this: if you're willing to do the <br/>
housecleaning for the files, then you might set yourself up to be <br/>
the administrator for a free photo storage site, such as Ofoto.com. <br/>
People could post their photos to the group, and then, after some <br/>
set time, the photos are moved to the "storage facility."<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 (no, make that 4) cents!<br/>

Steve --<br/>
<br/>
I've actually started working on this already. (I work<br/>
in web also, and it just seemed like a good way to<br/>
be able to keep the pix we have and still allow for <br/>
room for new ones.) I'm trimming down the file sizes <br/>
on the existing images in the Photos section. I think <br/>
once I finish, we should be able to replace the photos <br/>
that needed to be removed and still have room to <br/>
spare. I'm hoping to be done with it by the end of <br/>
the week or early next week.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
