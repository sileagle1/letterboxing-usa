who helped to make the Nor Cal Gathering such a success. My <br/>
family and I only had a limited time but it was so much fun <br/>
meeting the letterboxers - veterans and newbies alike, and to <br/>
make so many exchanges.  We couldn't believe that letterboxers <br/>
we have only read about in the posts were there - Amanda from <br/>
Seattle, Sir Balthazar, Jugglermouse, Silent Doug, Miss Vickie, <br/>
A-bear to name just a few. I was able to introduce my son to <br/>
Lizardbutt's family, the Hiker, Jet Lag and Bookworm. We <br/>
enjoyed meeting Javalord and Esmecat, Calpilot, and Hikr Girls. <br/>
We had so much fun exchanging stamps that we didn't have <br/>
time to search for the letterboxes. I know we missed many <br/>
others who came later in the day.<br/>
<br/>
The park was so lovely that we returned today (Sunday) and was <br/>
able to complete the Boxer Family Series, Itchy and Scratchy, <br/>
Take a Hike and No Speed Zone. We plan to return and do <br/>
Princess Lea's Schoolhouse Rock. Is the Moscow Exchange <br/>
Letterbox still there or has it moved on?<br/>
<br/>
We had a grand time. My son Turtle Leader was so excited about <br/>
meeting everybody that we're planning to attend the SLO event.<br/>
See you all there.<br/>

On behalf of the planning committe (Doublesaj, Miss Vickie and myself), I am so glad <br/>
everyone had such a good time.  Doublesaj is already hinting about making it an <br/>
annual event!  What warms my heart the most is that new boxes are ALREADY being <br/>
planted in the area as a direct result of the gathering - that was one of the main <br/>
objectives of the event: to grow this area, since it is plain to me everytime I look in <br/>
one of my log books that there is plenty of interest around here, but not many have <br/>
taken the "planting plunge."  Keep up the good work everybody - I look forward to <br/>
finding all your boxes in the near future.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as the boxes that are in Kennedy Grove, The Boxer Family series is *by far* the <br/>
hardest hike.  Schoolhouse Rock is a somewhat challenging hike but should not elicit <br/>
too much huffing and puffing.  Everything else is easy.  And #4 in the Schoolhouse <br/>
Rock series is there!  I checked it after the event was over with Amanda, A-Bear and <br/>
Papa Jiggs - it was a little better hidden, but still intact.  I will modify the clues <br/>
slightly so as not to frustrate future hunters too much.  The Moscow Exchange <br/>
Student was only "visiting" for the day of the event and has left the park - sorry you <br/>
missed it!  Doug, any chance it will be making an appearance at the SLO event?<br/>

Thanks for the kudos on the event! We were disappointed you had to leave <br/>
before the group photo was taken but, alas, only about half the wonderful <br/>
attendees were there for that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Is the Moscow Exchange <br/>
&gt; Letterbox still there or has it moved on?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Silent Doug took that box along with him, sorry to say. But I think it's <br/>
great that you got all the rest! Glad to hear of your enthusiasm, It's certainly <br/>
catching. With any luck, we might see you in SLO.<br/>

Well, shoot -- we should have thought of it while I was there and I could <br/>
have passed it on to Sir B or others for the SLO event!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe I'll make a new travelling event stamp so that PA can <br/>
represent at all these gatherings -- much smaller in size, of course! <g><br/>
