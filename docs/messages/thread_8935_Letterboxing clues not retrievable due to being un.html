Every now and then our ISP (hispeed.net) can be a little squirrely, <br/>
and it always seems to happen on a Sunday. I think they must have a <br/>
weekend warrior staff member who has responsibility for more than he <br/>
is trained for. Still, there have been several mistakes in links for <br/>
that area that are my own fault. I've got to tell you that, even tho' <br/>
I'm a Virgo, I'm not a very detail-oriented kinda guy, and this <br/>
webmastering thing is all about little periods and commas lined up in <br/>
exactly regimented order. I'll dig around tonight and make sure they <br/>
all work.<br/>
