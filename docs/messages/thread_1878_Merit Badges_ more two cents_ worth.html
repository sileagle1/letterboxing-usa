VALERIE:<br/>
 There are alot of good ideas floating around about the merit badges <br/>
 and more good ideas come into the discussion every day. Even though <br/>
 Kay has invited and considered input from the group on this, I sense <br/>
 there is some kind of urgency here. (OK, maybe it's just enthusiasm.) <br/>
 But please, let's not rush into a merit badge design before there's <br/>
 been ample time to consider all the options.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
KAY:<br/>
Hi Val.  :o)   You're right.  Its a mixture of enthusiasm  and "lets's get <br/>
this thing going"  so I can make the first order and get rid of the one time <br/>
set up fee for eternity.  :o).  I was hoping for some input since my goal is <br/>
to have RuthAnn (if she is willing) set up the order form and then I can back <br/>
out and let people order these on an as needed basis after the initial order <br/>
is made.   :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
VAL:<br/>
 Jeremy Disch: I feel your idea of one single merit badge containing <br/>
 all the P and F denominations was a really good one. (See post <br/>
 #4947). That way a person orders one single patch and cuts it up as <br/>
 needed. No waiting to order the next denomination, one time <br/>
 shipping/handling charge. Simple, clean, one-shot deal. <br/>
 Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be what's evolving here.<br/>
<br/>
KAY:  Maybe that needs to be clarified.    :o)<br/>
After the first order we will have Jeremy's idea almost exactly (But limited <br/>
to 10 merit badges per swath of cloth).  <br/>
I need to make this first order in bulk form to spread out the one time <br/>
computer set up fee.  I left the Logo Patch off the "swath set" because the <br/>
shop wouldn't be able to exactly duplicate the LbNA patch already received <br/>
and would drive the cost way up :o)<br/>
<br/>
VAL: <br/>
 For me, it's never quite been about "racking up the numbers". So <br/>
 you'll forgive me if I've little to offer in the way of merit badge <br/>
 ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
KAY: I understand that not everyone will be interested in the merit badges.  <br/>
The scouts that I know  love the idea and so do my non-scout kids.  They are <br/>
thrilled with the idea of wear a matching cap with an LbNA logo patch in the <br/>
middle and adding small merit badges as they earn them.  :o)   Everyone will <br/>
have different ideas.  I am just hoping that whatever gets posted, <br/>
eventually, on the LbNA site in the way of purchasing patches will be <br/>
something the group can live with.  :o)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Discussion is good.   This is what I was hoping to get.  Ideas and interest.  <br/>
:o)<br/>
