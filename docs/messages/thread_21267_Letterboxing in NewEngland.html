&gt; Gwen &amp; I did a little boxing in Seal Beach today and nearly had <br/>
heat stroke. While the rest of the country was nice and cool we had <br/>
to suffer through a sunshiny 82 degrees. The worst part was I forgot <br/>
my bermuda shorts in Kernville and sweltered in long pants.(This is <br/>
primarily for Jay.)<br/>

Unable to make the recent caravan boxing trip that involved scurrying <br/>
from heated car to defrosted suv, M and I went for a hike in <br/>
yesterday's -10 degree sunshine. I had on my new silk underarmor <br/>
(sorry, LPNH) and was only frozen to the...bone...when I slipped on a <br/>
glaciated puddle. Thankfully my portable-desk sized box of stamps <br/>
broke my fall.<br/>

Did we mention that the 3rd corner of the continental US (ref in the <br/>
previous two posts) was suffering under an unbearable 64 degrees <br/>
(thank you 'pineapple express'?  Not bad since last week boasted <br/>
temperatures in the mid-low 30s and freezing rain.  Anyways, <br/>
letterboxing in this miserable heat wave is almost out of the <br/>
question--as we can't locate our summer clothes all that quickly--<br/>
they've been stowed away until we get our 8 short weeks of summer <br/>
sometime next July.  If we do get to go out before then, who knows <br/>
if the letterboxes are even still there--with all the record <br/>
rainfall we've experienced the past couple of days--many of the <br/>
letterboxes have probably floated away already and are now headed <br/>
either to Alaska or Asia.  Just waiting on a letterboxing weather <br/>
report from Florida now...  ;)<br/>

Okay,   It's absolutely gorgeous here, so everyone should be making plans to <br/>
come for the gathering on Feb. 5.   (shameless plug)<br/>
<br/>
Highs have been in the high sixties or low seventies.   It's a bit on the <br/>
breezy side, but sunny.   This is our prime boxing time of year!<br/>
