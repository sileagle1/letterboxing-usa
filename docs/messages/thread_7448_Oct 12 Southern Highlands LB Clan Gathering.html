Gathering Sept 28 .....so.....regardless, I am issuing an invitation to any <br/>
real or perceived Southern Highlanders (Buckeyes included :) to gather at an <br/>
already-planned event, the 10th Annual Roast at Higgins.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, October 12, 2002<br/>
Higgins, NC (nearest town Burnsville - 10 miles, nearest city Asheville - 40 <br/>
miles)<br/>
<br/>
You can come anytime during the day; the meat is served usually around 3:30 <br/>
or 4....I will update if that changes.<br/>
<br/>
Bring a dish to pass (a carton of coleslaw, a can of olives, or a bucket of <br/>
chicken from "the road" or nearby grocery is fine - it's a true "potluck").<br/>
<br/>
Bring whatever it is you like to drink (this is a dry county, so buy any <br/>
desired alcohol before you get here).<br/>
<br/>
Bring a lawn chair.<br/>
<br/>
Bring a pith helmet or some other substantial headgear just in case all the <br/>
black walnuts have not yet blown off the tree.<br/>
<br/>
This is the height of leaf season, so if you are camping or motelling, you <br/>
will want to make reservations soon.  I will post detailed RV park, <br/>
campground, motel, and B&amp;B info in the next couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
A note to vegetarians:  the main entree is roast pork.  You will not be the <br/>
only vegetarians there; like them, you may prefer to come after it is <br/>
served.<br/>
