the backpacks with a stool: http://tinyurl.com/a277b<br/>
<br/>
Of course, if you're the type who likes those really long hikes, you<br/>
might want this 3-in-1 style instead. (grin) http://tinyurl.com/8kqhu<br/>
<br/>
If you want to know what they have been selling for, just do an<br/>
advanced search for "backpack + stool" and near the bottom of the<br/>
page, select "completed auctions only"<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

stamps in to a letterbox. This put so much strain on my knees that <br/>
after one productive day of letterboxing I couldn't walk for a week! <br/>
So I investigated the BackPack/Stool combos like my friend Scarab <br/>
uses but instead I opted to buy a "mini stool" that clips on to my <br/>
present backpack.<br/>
<br/>
I have purchase two types but the one I use all the time is called <br/>
"Slacker Stool" by XNation Sports which I bought thru Amazon.com for <br/>
$7.70 plus shipping... here are a couple of other online stores:<br/>

<br/>
I have found that I don't have to detach it from my pack to set it <br/>
up. I just set my pack down and use the stool while it's still <br/>
tethered to my pack. It is very light and I quickly became <br/>
accustomed to having it attached to my pack.<br/>
