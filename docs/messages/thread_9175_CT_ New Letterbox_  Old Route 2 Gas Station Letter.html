<br/>Old Route 2 Gas Station Letterbox
<br/>Town: Glastonbury
<br/>County: Hartford
<br/>Time: 10-20 minutes one way
<br/>Difficulty: Easy Letterbox, One long hill!
<br/>Planted on: November 14, 2002 by Pam
<br/>
<br/>Directions: Going East on Route 2 (from Hartford) take exit 10 (route 83).  At the end of the exit, turn right.  At the stop sign, turn left onto New London Tpke.  At the fork, bear right onto Wassuc Road.  At next stop sign, go straight.  Soon you will come to where you can get back onto Route 2 east.  MAKE SURE YOU BEAR LEFT to stay on Wassuc Road.  At the end of Wassuc Road, you will see a yellow gate.  Park on the culdesac at the yellow gate.
<br/>
<br/>If Going West on Route 2 (from Norwich/New London) take exit 11 (Thompson Street, Wassuc Street).  At the end of the ramp, turn right and park on the culdesac at the yellow gate.
<br/>
<br/>Go past the yellow gate and walk across the sandy lot.  You will see dirt bike trails on your left.  Soon, you will get to another yellow gate.  This one is at the start of the white trail.  Most of the time it is open.  Go up the hill on the paved road (white trail).  This paved road is part of the old Route 2.  You will soon notice the Glastonbury Rifle Range on your left.  Keep going up the hill.  When you get to the top, it flattens out and is slightly more open.  On your left, you will notice some ruins.  These may be the ruins of the old gas station which used to stand somewhere in this area.  Go around the ruins to the far right pillar.  From there, go generally southeast 15 paces to a small pine.  From there, look slightly to your right and see three large boulders.  Go 30 paces east southeast to the largest boulder you see.  There is a split in the top.  Go around to the far side of the boulder and in the split, you will find what you seek under some smaller stones and branches.   Keep in mind, that I do not have a compass and was using the setting sun for the directions!  Hope you enjoyed your hunt!
<br/>
<br/>Go and visit the Dragonfly at the Tadpole Pool Letterbox, which is on the same white trail!
