                    <div class="plaintext-content">Aug 3 is the 50 th anniversary of Mansfield Hollow Dam  and <br/>
Mansfield  Homecoming Day. All day special events are planned in the <br/>
state park and at the dam. Running  and biking races, a bass <br/>
tournament , ceremonies, Kayak and canoe demos, old time baseball, a <br/>
dog agility trial, and at 2:00  Leader of the pack will be running a <br/>
letterbox event to reintroduce the old kettle Hole Trail. It was the <br/>
first trail marked in the park and  fell in disrepair. Work is under <br/>
progress to restore the trail and  add to it a  set of letterboxes . <br/>
More info will be available as the time draws nearer.  It would be a <br/>
great day to set aside for your family  to enjoy all the resources of <br/>
mansfield Hollow. The lake is no swimming as it is a resevoir but the <br/>
fishing is excellent. <br/>
<br/>
Look for the Letterboxing table at the pine picnic grove off bassetts <br/>
Bridge Rd.  2 p.m. Aug 3.  See you there!   <br/>
