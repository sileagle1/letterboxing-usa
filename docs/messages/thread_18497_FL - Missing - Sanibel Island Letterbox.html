                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well Folks, it's "officially" missing... my first hide, "Sanibel <br/>
Island Letterbox". I went back today to check and it still hasn't <br/>
been returned.  As I was there pondering why anyone would spoil such <br/>
a peaceful activity, a local came by.  We chatted about this and <br/>
that for a while and then I shared with him a little about what I <br/>
was searching for.  He said a crew came through a few days ago to <br/>
spray for non-native vegetation and picked up litter as they went.  <br/>
I explained about the clearly written notice "NOT TRASH" and he said <br/>
he noticed the group was mostly comprised of immigrants and possibly <br/>
couldn't read English.  Now, that never occurred to me.  <br/>
