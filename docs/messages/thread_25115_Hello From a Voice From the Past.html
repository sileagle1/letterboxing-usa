Just a quick note to say Hi as a test.  I have been a member of this list since 1999 and now that I would like to jump in and participate again it doesn't appear that I'm a member of the list any more even though I get the digest every day (but only just recently started to read it again) and have for the past 10 years (WOW I can't believe that it has been that long.)  I'm sending this out not from the Yahoo "Post" spot but by putting the address into my email "To" spot with the hope that this works.  If it does, can someone tell me how to re-instate my membership to the list without re-joining?  I don't want to end up getting two digests.  Yes I tried doing the directions for lost password, any other suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Once I'm straightened out I would love to tell you about my recent adventures, like we use to do in the old days.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm so comforted to see that so many of you are still here (love the controversy... amazing that it continues after so many years), Hi Don, Tom, Der Mad Stamper, Ryan, and everyone else.  <br/>

Big Hugs to you all,  Wendy (a.k.a. Love to Carve)<br/>

You may want to change your 'mail options' to individual messages,  <br/>
rather than the digest.  You can't reply to a digest (since it  <br/>
contains more than one message/topic/etc. but you can to individual  <br/>
messages.  That may be why you had to go 'off line' (so to speak) to  <br/>
post your message.<br/>

We have missed you in Ca. We have missed those fantastic stamps as well. There have been several changes to the game since you were last boxing. One of them is our little group in SoCal. The list isn't very busy but the folks are very nice and are avid letterboxers.<br/>
One of them even planted and posted a clue titled "California's First" and it is planted at the site of our first gathering. Just you, Amanda, Gwen and Don.<br/>
