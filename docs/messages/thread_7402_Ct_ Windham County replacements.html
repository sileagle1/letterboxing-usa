to the Sea and You Otter See that boxes both having been  taken or  <br/>
emptied. They are in a very high traffic area and as Otter was to be <br/>
handicapped accesible she has had trouble before. I will attempt a <br/>
more secure yet  accesible location.  Paddle may go a few trees <br/>
deeper into the woods which does not go with the story well but will <br/>
protect him more. I'll post any changes upon placing them back where <br/>
they belong.   leader of the Pack<br/>
