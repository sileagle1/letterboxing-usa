Shane Odom of the Woodwooses here in MD. Tomorrow we are heading to <br/>
Mt Vernon to see the place that ole' George built. I picke up the <br/>
clues for one at Jones Point, several in Huntley Meadows and one at <br/>
Fort Hood Park placed by the HIKE IT/OR BIKE IT folks. In their clue <br/>
that mention several times the Mt Vernon Trail Series and even <br/>
mention the boxes on that series by name. Such as "Runway Box" <br/>
and "Knowhadamean Fern". I looked through the clues list and did <br/>
searches but I cannot find mention of these anywhere. Is the series <br/>
still out there and can any one tell me? <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
