This is a different request than those that are traveling somewhere <br/>
and looking for some "drive-by's" on their way.  Instead we are <br/>
interested in a 1-week destination/trip with some good hiking, with <br/>
letterboxing considered an added bonus.  We're looking for a <br/>
destination that will have reasonable weather in early to mid-<br/>
November and that has some nice 3 to 15-mile hikes, hopefully <br/>
incorporating some letterboxing.  We are just two adults, so no need <br/>
for child/pet friendly locations.  We especially enjoy challenging <br/>
hikes.  I posted a request for info on a regional board, but got <br/>
minimal response.  I'm therefore posting on the "big board" to see <br/>
what some of you might recommend.<br/>
<br/>
The new "AtlasQuest" website has a great feature to try to identify <br/>
this type of hike/letterbox, but since it is relatively new it only <br/>
includes about 10% of current letterboxes.  I'd therefore really <br/>
appreciate any additional suggestions you may have for some <br/>
challenging hikes &amp; letterboxes.<br/>

<br/>
All my favorite hiking trails are under snow in November.  The only <br/>
backpacking trip I did in November was down to the bottom of the <br/>
Grand Canyon.  It's still INCREDIBILY busy (a minus), but it's far <br/>
preferable to the heat of the summer during the tourist season.  It's <br/>
pretty darned neat at the bottom too.  (The view from the bottom, I <br/>
think, is far more impressive than the view at the top!)  Don't know <br/>
of any letterboxes out there, but I'm glad I did the trip.  =)<br/>
<br/>
You might also check out the Zion Canyon area.  The place is darned <br/>
near empty--which is much preferable than the summer season.  It gets <br/>
pretty cold there in the winter, but the two times I've been there <br/>
there's never been snow on the ground that makes hiking easy.  =)  <br/>
Bryce Canyon is spectacular, but has always had a thin layer of snow <br/>
every time I've been there.  (Thin, as in an inch thick, perhaps.  <br/>
Still pretty easy hiking most of the time.)<br/>
<br/>
I always thought it might be fun to hike from Key West to the <br/>
mainland.  That's part of the International Appalachian Trail, as I <br/>
understand it.  Flat, easy walking with restaurants and food <br/>
everywhere.  Luxurious hiking, to be sure!  =)<br/>
<br/>
Arizona does have a lot of neat hiking areas--even outside of the <br/>
Grand Canyon--which are very comfortable to hike in the depths of <br/>
November.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The new "AtlasQuest" website has a great feature to try to identify <br/>
&gt; this type of hike/letterbox, but since it is relatively new it only <br/>
&gt; includes about 10% of current letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Ahh.... But you forget--nobody but me actually hides boxes on 'long' <br/>
hikes, so all of the letterboxes with long hikes ARE listed.  ;o)<br/>
<br/>
Just kidding!  But I would bet that well over 90% of all letterboxes <br/>
require less than three miles of hiking.  There's just not a large <br/>
number of us long-distance hikers who letterbox, unfortunately.  <br/>

If you want You can hike 4 state parks in Northern VA and get a hat <br/>
pin from each park.  They have the books at the parks.  Parks are <br/>
Sky Meadows SP, Shandowa River SP, Mason Neck SP, and Leesalvalina <br/>
(spelling) SP.  Mason Neck is the head quarters form the parks.  you <br/>
get a book and get it stamped when you finish each park.  it took us <br/>
about 4-5 visits to finish Sky Meadows and Shandoa River park.  the <br/>
other 2 parks were hiked in 1 day each.  3 of the 4 parks have at <br/>
least 1 letter box in them.  Shandoa river (andy Guist) has no boxes <br/>
but is a really cool park to hike in.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this heps. (forgive the spelling errors please)<br/>

I just checked in my "Circuit Hikes in Northern NJ" book and found <br/>
that the majority of the hikes listed fit into your distance <br/>
parameters, and at least 14 of the 25 have letterboxes. Check out <br/>
http://www.nynjtc.org/trails/index.html<br/>
to see what's in the area, and just over the border in NY. The state <br/>
parks have lots of trails, too, which are not all included in the <br/>
Conference listings. If you go to<br/>
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/index.html<br/>
you can search for parks by activity, then check out trail <br/>
information on the page for that park. Lots of the NJ boxes are in <br/>
state parks, although some are mysteries and take some research <br/>
first.<br/>
The Batona Trail in the south is a full 50 miles long, with many <br/>
trailheads, and boxes, too.<br/>
Of course, the leaf season is over in Nov., but the real cold won't <br/>
have set in yet, and we rarely have snow before Christamas these <br/>
days.<br/>
And of course, being a small state, nothing is far from wherever you <br/>
choose to lodge, so you don't spend a lot of time on the road <br/>
getting to your trailhead.<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a different request than those that are traveling <br/>
somewhere <br/>
&gt; and looking for some "drive-by's" on their way.  Instead we are <br/>
&gt; interested in a 1-week destination/trip with some good hiking, <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; letterboxing considered an added bonus.  We're looking for a <br/>
&gt; destination that will have reasonable weather in early to mid-<br/>
&gt; November and that has some nice 3 to 15-mile hikes, hopefully <br/>
&gt; incorporating some letterboxing.  We are just two adults, so no <br/>
need <br/>
&gt; for child/pet friendly locations.  We especially enjoy challenging <br/>
&gt; hikes.  I posted a request for info on a regional board, but got <br/>
&gt; minimal response.  I'm therefore posting on the "big board" to see <br/>
&gt; what some of you might recommend.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The new "AtlasQuest" website has a great feature to try to <br/>
identify <br/>
&gt; this type of hike/letterbox, but since it is relatively new it <br/>
only <br/>
&gt; includes about 10% of current letterboxes.  I'd therefore really <br/>
&gt; appreciate any additional suggestions you may have for some <br/>
&gt; challenging hikes &amp; letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THANK YOU!<br/>
