<br/>
I'm new to this list since I found out about letterboxing last week.  My<br/>
fellow Girl Guide Leader and I were out in the bush planning for an Enviro<br/>
Quest event for our older girls (15-18).  I later get an excited email from<br/>
her asking me to look at the site.  I think it's wonderful and we will be<br/>
sure to incorporate letterboxing for the girls next year.  The girls will be<br/>
doing some advanced orienteering with challenges along the way and I think<br/>
finding a letterbox and stamping as they go will be alot of fun.  Geesh, I<br/>
know we are excited!!  I have to keep reminding myself that we plan these<br/>
events for the girls.  (wink, wink)<br/>
<br/>
I've been collecting some very good tips and ideas from this list.  Wouldn't<br/>
it be fun to incorporate letterboxing into a car rally?  Has this been done<br/>
yet?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I can get something started in Alberta..........what fun!<br/>
<br/>
I can also relate to "be ma's" 3 year old screaming about an ant on her<br/>
shoe.  Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers all!<br/>
