<div>Ryan's Calico letterbox is MIA,so we planted 
another letterbox in a different place in Calico-- clues to follow. Zzyzx is 
alive and well with several entries.Two geodes were added to the pile under the 
box. This hike should not be taken directly after a rain. We finished the hike 
at sunset which was a real bonus! Pete &amp; 
Wanda's first mystery box  is  alive and well. The second stumped us as time was running short. 
Amanda's Gold fish gave us a wonderful area to check out and the One Armed 
Bandit was found after dark.Ryan's Pictograph series put us in an area that 
is a 9.9 on a 1 to 10 scale and we couldn't help but add another box. We 
didn't have time for the other mystery box, but a new box was placed north of 
Mesquite actually in near by Arizona; clues 
to follow . Don &amp; Gwen</div>
