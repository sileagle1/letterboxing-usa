<h2>Frye Cove County Park</h2>
<p>Nearest Town: Olympia, WA <br/>County: Thurston<br/>Placed: 12/4/02<br/>Placed 
By: Fudrick <br/>Clues: Trivial <br/>Trek: Moderate. A bit of up and down, but 
there are railroad tie steps where needed.</p>
<p>Pets: Frye Cove County Park is a Thurston County Pet Control and License 
Zone.</p>
<p>Reminder: a great place for a picnic lunch.</p>
<p align="justify">Frye Cove Park - located on the West side of Eld Inlet. the 
southernmost part of Puget Sound. Named after George W. Frye who owned the 
property on the shore North of Flapjack Point. Acquired in 1973 by Thurston 
County. Now a Thurston County Park with 1,400 feet of saltwater beach access and 
over 2 miles of trails in the 86 acres of forest. Frye Cove is a perfect setting 
for picnics, weddings, hiking, shellfish gathering, or nature walks along the 
trails with informative signage describing what you see. Enjoy the magnificent 
views up and down Eld Inlet and of Mt. Rainier. Two covered shelters are in the 
park, each with a picnic table and a barbecue grill.</p>
<p align="justify"></p><b>
</b><p>Directions to Frye Cove Park: From I-5 in Olympia, north or southbound, 
take Exit 104 (US 101 north, Aberdeen). Stay on US 101 toward Shelton. Take the 
Steamboat Island Rd Exit. Go north on Steamboat Island Rd NW about 5.8 miles and 
turn right onto Young Rd NW. Proceed about 2 miles, turn left on 61st Ave NW 
into Frye Cove County Park. Park in the parking lot.</p>
<p>As you head back to US 101, consider turning right on Steamboat Island Road 
NW and take the short trip to Steamboat Island, the most densly populated island 
you will ever see!</p><b>
</b><p>Clues: From the parking lot, head East down the hill, across the road you 
drove in on. After crossing the road, you come to a directional sign, pointing 
out the picnic area ahead and the trail to the viewpoint to the left. Take the 
trail to the viewpoint to the left. Note the signs describing the flora in the 
forest. You will come to a T with a pole fence to keep you from falling over the 
cliff. The viewpoint is to the left, is provides a great view of Eld Inlet, and 
is worth seeing.  Turn right to the picnic area. You will spot twin Red Alders 
(so the sign says). Frye is nestled between the twins. After securely hiding 
Frye, continue on toward the picnic area. Pause at the Mount Rainier Viewpoint, 
hopefully the mountain is out. At a Y, continue on to the beach, bypassing the 
picnic area for now. Going by the beach, you will note that is  not quite a 
swimming beach :-(. Continue on the Cove Trail.  Go down and up thru the 
small draw.  The first side trail to the left goes out to an overlook of 
Frye Cove, enjoy the tranquility. Continuing on the Cove Trail, the second side 
trail to the left goes into a small grove of trees. As you enjoy their majesty, 
you may notice a stump.  Cove is safely hidden inside. After securely hiding 
Cove, continue on Cove Trail back to the parking lot.</p><i>
