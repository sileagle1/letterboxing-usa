                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon enjoyed the warm weather Saturday and found the <br/>
following<br/>
boxes " Fly Like an Eagle " at the Mildred Morse Allen Wildlife <br/>
Sanctuary<br/>
in Canton MA ( Great idea ! and a very nice park : ). " Great Blue <br/>
Heron "<br/>
and " Red Fox " both of the " Meander to the Marsh " Series ( It was<br/>
awesome to see literally hundreds of Robins in the fields here . A <br/>
sure<br/>
sign of Spring : ) ) also the " Beside the Bayside Bandshell " all of<br/>
these are in Warren RI .  After a late start in even warmer weather <br/>
Sunday<br/>
we again ventured into RI in search of " Toaster Head "  in West <br/>
Greenwich<br/>
. We had difficulty finding the trailhead ( Is there some new logging <br/>
going<br/>
on here or is the trail further up the road over the bridge ? ) and <br/>
were<br/>
lucky to see a calf born in a field right next to the road . Both mom <br/>
and<br/>
the little one were fine : ) . We decided to move on to the Doug <br/>
Rayner<br/>
Wildlife Sanctuary to pick up the " Nockham Hill Turtle " ( A very <br/>
well<br/>
done stamp and great shore side walk ) then it was off to Goddard <br/>
State<br/>
Park in Warwick<br/>
in search of " Pirates Past Noon " we located ( After more difficulty <br/>
then<br/>
was called for I'm sure ) " The Map " but the treasure eluded us : (  <br/>
All<br/>
in all we had a great weekend !<br/>
<br/>
Thanks All<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon had an awesome weekend of boxing ! We got a late <br/>
start Saturday ( Ryan had a birthday party to attend ) but made it to <br/>
Woodshole about 3 O'clock to find " Secrets of the Knob " ( I believe <br/>
this to be the oldest box we have found : ) We found it sitting in <br/>
the open : ( but have returned it to its original hiding place : ) <br/>
also " Nobsque Light " ( This was tricky Chris ) we then headed for <br/>
Pocasset to grab the " Four Ponds Conservation Area " ( Very nice <br/>
stamp ). <br/>
After dinner at Shaws ( the place with the landlocked Tug ) we <br/>
decided to throw caution to the wind , unpacked our flashlights and <br/>
headed out into the dark and very foggy night to find " Gateway to <br/>
the Cape Cod Canal " ( Ryan somehow found the right tree , it was <br/>
incredibly dark out here ) and the " Belmont Rock " Letterboxes . <br/>
Sunday we headed for RI and found " Blue Jay at Blue Pond " then <br/>
headed for the Long and Ell Pond Natural Area ( this place is great ) <br/>
to find " Dragon in the Rock " ( a bat was keeping this box company , <br/>
I don't know who was startled more him or me ) and Laurette's " To be <br/>
precise... ". Next up was the " Dog Days of Summer " series . We <br/>
found all three of these  ( great stamps ! Moonstone Baby ) and I <br/>
remembered something about " Tin Tin " and airplanes and managed to <br/>
find " Adventures of Tin Tin " with out any clues : )<br/>
<br/>
As I said it was awesome to be out in such great weather .<br/>

Thanks All<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamGreenDragon put in a full weekend of boxing and added the <br/>
following to or log . Started out Friday morning with " Summer <br/>
Village " , " Turtle " , " Worship " , " Trout " , and " Hunter " ( <br/>
where I found " The Misplaced Moose " HH ) , these are all of the " <br/>
Native Son " series at the " Big River Mgt.  Area " in Coventry RI . <br/>
Saturday we headed out very early and started out in the dark to <br/>
find " Native Son #1 " , " Native Son #2 " , " Native Son # 5 " plus <br/>
the " Bonus Box " all in Leominster MA then " Lancaster 350 " in <br/>
Lancaster . Easter Sunday we spent at " Purgatory State Park " in <br/>
Sutton MA where we found " Two Hearts " , " Intimacy " ' " <br/>
Feelings " , and " Proposal " all part of " The Proposal " series ( <br/>
these boxes are in tough shape , we did the repairs we could , but I <br/>
think the first three need replacement boxes . Has anybody heard from <br/>
Gretchen &amp; Jeremy ? I know there box in the Blue Hills Is also in <br/>
need of care . All in all we had a great weekend ! We are very much <br/>
looking forward to the Cape gathering and hope to see you there .<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to All !<br/>
