Talk about a blast!!!  Not sure of the final tally of attendees but <br/>
there were quite a lot of letterboxers present and even more <br/>

have to attempt to find the permanent boxes there in the park at a <br/>

Thanks Team Rayvenhaus for all of your hard work in coordinating &amp; <br/>
outfitting such a great event and &amp; myriad thanks to all the other <br/>
great folks out there who contributed so many neat and interesting <br/>
letterboxes to making today's event such a success!  It was so great <br/>
getting to meet all of you and we can't wait for the next big <br/>
regional letterboxing event!<br/>

See you on the trails...<br/>
