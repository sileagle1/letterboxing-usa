<br/>
John Kerry said he was slowing down his campaign schedule the next <br/>
few weeks and I guess he meant what he said. He had time for this <br/>
interview with us this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
In an effort for fairness in campaigning, we encourage President Bush <br/>
to contact us also, send his signature stamp and do an interview with <br/>
us. This will enable the reader to experience balanced reporting and <br/>
the ability to see both sides of letteboxing issues.<br/>
<br/>
If you, the reader, are interested, the interview is ready. Just <br/>
click on Senator Kerry's picture in the first story on our website <br/>
and you will be magically transported to Kerryland.<br/>
<br/>
And always . . .<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>

solved that maddening Tim's Prize clue. Now I'm positive that he has the smarts to <br/>
get his letterboxing agenda through Congress. However, I am more than a little <br/>
worried knowing that I have a verboten elephant stamp in my roster. Little did I know <br/>
that this was one of those pesky unwritten rules. My only excuse is that it wasn't <br/>
hidden during a campaign year. Funhog<br/>

John Kerry has his own mind! He doesn't need to be influenced by anyone. Now if we could only hear from President Bush - those upset by the political overtones of this interview might be appeased.<br/>

Dearest Lynn,<br/>
<br/>
Her Ladyship recalls that when you introduced yourself to us that you<br/>
did so whilst quoting scripture and professing a Christian faith. This<br/>
response is not even lady-like and certainly not in keeping with<br/>
Christian teaching (John 8:7). Have you had a crisis of faith or are<br/>
you simply a poor practitioner of your faith?<br/>

My what a curious choice of passages, Lynne. In addition to stating<br/>
that God has delivered your enemies into your hands it seems to grant<br/>
permission to take a female captive as a slave; you aren't by chance a<br/>

&gt; Hi boxers:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; John Kerry said he was slowing down his campaign<br/>
&gt; schedule the next <br/>
&gt; few weeks and I guess he meant what he said. He had<br/>
&gt; time for this <br/>
&gt; interview with us this afternoon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In an effort for fairness in campaigning, we<br/>
&gt; encourage President Bush <br/>
&gt; to contact us also, send his signature stamp and do<br/>
&gt; an interview with <br/>
&gt; us. This will enable the reader to experience<br/>
&gt; balanced reporting and <br/>
&gt; the ability to see both sides of letteboxing issues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you, the reader, are interested, the interview is<br/>
&gt; ready. Just <br/>
&gt; click on Senator Kerry's picture in the first story<br/>
&gt; on our website <br/>
&gt; and you will be magically transported to Kerryland.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And always . . .<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have fun and just get out there &amp; box!!!<br/>
