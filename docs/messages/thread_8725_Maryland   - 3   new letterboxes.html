<br/>
<br/>
     Centennial Park - North Area<br/>
     Off Old Annapolis Road, Columbia, Maryland<br/>
     Howard County<br/>
<br/>
 #1 Take Me To The Stars<br/>
<br/>
  Stanley is a Red Eared Slider from Texas. He charmed his way into <br/>
Princess Turtles life exactly one year ago. Princess Turtle loves <br/>
carnivals and to show his appreciation, Stanley decided to take her <br/>
to the last one of the year.<br/>
  They went to Centennial Park. Starting from the tennis courts they <br/>
headed back to the entrance. Following the path to the left and the <br/>
pine trees to the right. The two turtles went left at the fork in the <br/>
path. Stanley said they should arrive at the first ride shortly. <br/>
Princess Turtle needed to rest and chose the second bench on the <br/>
right. This was a perfect spot to wait in line for the ride. There <br/>
are 2 large pine trees to the right of the bench. Look at the base of <br/>
the first pine tree of the 2 for #1.<br/>
<br/>
  #2 Slightly Sweet, Slightly Salty<br/>
<br/>
  Continue down the trail. A little way on the right is an unpaved <br/>
trail. The Princess was hungry and this was the way to the local <br/>
eatery. She didn't want the usual pond food. She had a strong craving <br/>
for Kettle Corn. So they took a left at the pond and headed toward <br/>
the wooden bridge. Before the bridge the trail goes left. Look to the <br/>
left and beneath the large 2 in 1 tree that is where you will find <br/>
the Popcorn Stand.<br/>
<br/>
  #3 Two Tickets To Ride <br/>
<br/>
  Stanley and the Princess headed back to the paved trail for one <br/>
more ride. They went right, passed the tennis courts on the left and <br/>
crossed the concrete bridge. Up the winding road they went. They ran <br/>
into Matthew Radik. Being the good scout hat he was, he showed them <br/>
the way to the carousel. He told them to stay left and at the second <br/>
split, count 50 child size paces. You should see a faint path to your <br/>
left that leads to a large 3 in 1 tree. There you will find The <br/>
Golden Carousel.<br/>
  If you continue down the path it will take you to the big lake. <br/>
Stanley and Princess Turtle were very tired from their day. So they <br/>
came home and had a slice of homemade apple cranberry pie that <br/>
Princess Turtle had made to celebrate their first anniversary.<br/>
  THE END<br/>
