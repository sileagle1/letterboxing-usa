                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those of you interested in Dartmoor letterboxing, there are a couple of <br/>
books on the subject that have been published in the UK. They're not <br/>
available from any US booksellers that I know of, but you can order them <br/>
from Amazon.co.uk (http://www.amazon.co.uk/) and they will ship them to the <br/>
US. Because they're published by small publishers, Amazon.co.uk doesn't <br/>
always have them in stock, so it can take a month or longer for them to arrive.<br/>
<br/>
The search engine on the site won't turn up all the available titles if you <br/>
just search on "letterboxing," though, so here are some of the titles you <br/>
should look for:<br/>

I hope to get back there when there is less grass!!!!  The high grasses made <br/>
it hard to find rocks and boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, due to severe weather and missing boxes, we did not make it <br/>
into the Dartmoor 100 club on this visit.  Though I have not made a finally <br/>
official tally, we found over 80 boxes in 4 days.  Chris and Louise hope that we <br/>
can come back soon so we can get the last 20 or so.  On our second day in <br/>
Dartmoor, we got out to Barn Hill to find that the weather coming in from the west <br/>
was becoming quite worse.  We could really see the thunder and rain coming in <br/>
very hard!  We decided that rather than being on the top of a barren hill in a <br/>
thunder storm, we hiked off of the moor and spent the day driving around in <br/>
the car.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you know Louise Donovan, she was the British boxer doing a <br/>
dissertation on letterboxing, she sprained her ankle on our last day of boxing in <br/>
Dartmoor.  Instead of finding some last few boxes, we had to slowly hike out two <br/>
kilometers to the car.  If you would like to send her some get well wishes, <br/>
send them to: lmd2@aber.ac.uk<br/>
<br/>
Soon, I hope to have a website of pictures up and running from our trip.  <br/>
Anyway, Dartmoor was beautiful and I definitely hope to get back there soon.  For <br/>
those who know me fairly well, you know that I would love to live in England, <br/>
and this trip definitely solidified that for me!  As a matter of fact, Chris <br/>
(Louise's dad) asked again if I was looking into finding a job in England.  I <br/>
think he's going to keep a lookout for a music job for me.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we're back in one piece and will tell you more in the near future!<br/>
