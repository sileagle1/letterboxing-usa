#2 "TALL PINES" LETTERBOX  Placed on the "Nature Trail" <br/>
DIFFICULTY RATING: Easy to moderate. <br/>
We encountered small areas of rocky, rooty, muddy areas, and in one<br/>
stretch toward the end of #1 + 2 we needed to watch the trail signs<br/>
posted to know we were on the right path.  I don't know if it was<br/>
because of all the recent rain washing out the trail or if the trail<br/>
was just ambiguous at that point.  This is an appx. 1 mile loop and<br/>
the trail guide says it takes about 30 minutes to walk.  How long to<br/>
find the 2 boxes on this trail is up to you.<br/>
<br/>
#3 "TALL PINES UNDER THE MOON" LETTERBOX  <br/>
DIFFICULTY RATING: average but not suitable for small children. There<br/>
is some steep elevation change..<br/>
