missing and they weren't, I have the heartbreaking news that I have<br/>
officially had my first box disappear without a trace. The Goldeneye<br/>
letterbox on the Marginal Way in Ogunquit was reported missing to me<br/>
on 3/21 and again on 3/22. I finally got a chance to check on it this<br/>
evening and it is indeed gone.<br/>
In other sad news, the dam/causeway broke at the site where my Mystery<br/>
(you'll find out the name when you get there) box is located. There is<br/>
now a gaping chasm which is dangerous to cross. The managers of the<br/>
property are unsure when it will be fixed, but I'll update the clues<br/>
on the letterboxing.org website as appropriate. I expect this one will<br/>
be unavailable for a while though the box itself (and the bonus box)<br/>
are happily doing just fine.<br/>
