Ash Raven, JugglerMouse, and I went out yesterday along the coast. It <br/>
was a P1 F6 day for Ms. Mouse and myself. Raven got a P1 F1, since <br/>
she had already gotten most of the lot.<br/>
<br/>
Boxes we checked that were still there:<br/>
<br/>
Citizen Kane series (all three happy and healthy)<br/>
Moonstone Castle (good stamp, pretty location)<br/>
Salmon Creek Falls (great stamp &amp; planting site and lovely view)<br/>
Potty Break (still very much there in Gorda)<br/>
<br/>
Missing in action:<br/>
<br/>
Missing Map (we found the stones but they had been long disturbed)<br/>
Tink's Wand (a fountain plant in too easily seen location)<br/>
<br/>
We also did a first for us: we cut in a store owners on the plant and <br/>
have him and her hand you the box if you say the right thing. <br/>
*Teehee* They are stoked about it. Will post this Gandalf stamp clues <br/>
soon. Read about something similar in England where you go to a pub <br/>
and ask. Anybody else doing this?<br/>
<br/>
We are proud that the Central California Coast has more boxes than <br/>
any other region of California. Okay, we are none Connecticut yet, <br/>
but we are trying.<br/>
<br/>
I'm Feeling Lucky!<br/>
