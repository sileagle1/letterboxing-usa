Distance -  Maybe  a mile in and out<br/>
Time -  30 minutes <br/>
Difficulty - Easy.  The only tough part is knowing which trees we mean<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Brodie Park is located on the corner of West Hill and Niles Road. On <br/>
the lake side, there are 50 acres which can be used for soccer, <br/>
picnicking, swimming, boating and other outdoor activities; across<br/>
the <br/>
road there are an additional 150 acres on which you can hike on the <br/>
trail set up by the Conservation Commission, horseback ride, or take<br/>
a <br/>
leisurely stroll.<br/>
