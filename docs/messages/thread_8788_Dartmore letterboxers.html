Does anyone have information about the Dartmore chat group with the<br/>
letterboxers?  I recall an email about it a few weeks ago but didn't save<br/>
the information.  Since then, someone from England has just been introduced<br/>
to letterboxing in Vermont this summer.  They would like to get in contact<br/>
with the people in Dartmore if it's possible.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!<br/>

</p><p>regarding a chat room with Dartmoor letterboxes. I actually ran one last winter on msn. It was quite popular and we had a lot of you from across the pond join us in the chat room. I would like to get it aup and running again soon. If anyone is interested, then I will post a message with all the relevant details on this message board.
</p><p>Good hunting,
