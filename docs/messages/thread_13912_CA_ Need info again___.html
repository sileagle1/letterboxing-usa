&gt;  THE BEST OF DAVIS LETTERBOX SERIES<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This quest will net you 4 letterboxes only if you do your homework  <br/>
&gt; before you<br/>
&gt; start and are precise in deciphering the clues. The first part will be<br/>
&gt; predominantly in your car and the second part is a good mile on foot  <br/>
&gt; (or bike) along<br/>
&gt; a flat, paved, dog-on-leash-friendly path. About  to 1 hour is needed  <br/>
&gt; once<br/>
&gt; you begin but you can easily add an hour if you stop to eat fabulous  <br/>
&gt; burgers,<br/>
&gt; peruse the bookshelves or play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To the letterboxes!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Box #1<br/>
&gt; The best burger between Sacramento and the Bay Area was made at Murder  <br/>
&gt; Burger<br/>
&gt; in Davis, Calif. By popular demand of the notoriously humane Davisites,<br/>
&gt; Murder Burger is no more, but also still here and somehow turned  <br/>
&gt; around. Find this<br/>
&gt; burger place to start your search. Its best to be hungry when you  <br/>
&gt; arrive as it<br/>
&gt; s still the best burger around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The second letter in the name of this establishment is the street you  <br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; looking for next in downtown Davis. Go north-west and find a book  <br/>
&gt; store on this<br/>
&gt; street that Sam Spade would frequent. (Heres looking at you kid)  <br/>
&gt; You might<br/>
&gt; want to park your car and spend a little time on foot as this is one  <br/>
&gt; of many<br/>
&gt; great book stores in town. Im Scottish (cheap) so I love used book  <br/>
&gt; stores like<br/>
&gt; this one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From this store go 8 doors south. Be careful to count ALL of the  <br/>
&gt; doors. This<br/>
&gt; name of the establishment behind this door is the theme of the  <br/>
&gt; treasure you<br/>
&gt; seek. Memorizing it will help you later to find your ultimate goal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Get back in your car and go north 2  blocks then go east 0.8 miles.  <br/>
&gt; Turn<br/>
&gt; north following a prominent Pole Line. Traveling a ways through a  <br/>
&gt; residential<br/>
&gt; neighborhood, youre looking next for a nugget with fine greens. Its  <br/>
&gt; past Carl<br/>
&gt; s and Picasso (no, you havent gone too far!) and is the theme park  <br/>
&gt; that is<br/>
&gt; the home of the sought treasure.<br/>
&gt; Turn east at this park and enter the 2nd driveway on your right. Park  <br/>
&gt; at the<br/>
&gt; far end.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Note: On occasion, this park is filled with hundreds of people which  <br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; make your job of being discreet quite difficult but not impossible.  <br/>
&gt; Just be<br/>
&gt; careful and be sure to rehide the boxes well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now: How many LETTERS were in the name of the theme store you found  <br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; in downtown Davis? Multiply this number by 12. From the end of this  <br/>
&gt; parking<br/>
&gt; area, go on a bearing of this number and find a lamp post. From here,  <br/>
&gt; go to the<br/>
&gt; nearest fence post and you will find your goal hanging there!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Box #2<br/>
&gt; Go to the nearest walking path and head SE. Youll see Leonardo on  <br/>
&gt; your left<br/>
&gt; give him a wave. This path passes the ends of several cul-de-sacs as  <br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; meander through. Dont waste your time looking at the big rocks or  <br/>
&gt; the parallel<br/>
&gt; barsyoure only 55 steps away from your next find! Walk that 55 paces  <br/>
&gt; to a<br/>
&gt; tree on the north side of the path. At the base of the tree is a low  <br/>
&gt; bush.<br/>
&gt; Look under the only rock under that bush to find box #2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Box #3<br/>
&gt; Continue on the path a ways, passing a drinking fountain, which is  <br/>
&gt; nearly<br/>
&gt; half way to the next box. The path bends in a southerly direction.  <br/>
&gt; Take a rest<br/>
&gt; where you see the symbol of Davis but againdont waste your time as  <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; Best of Davis #3 is behind you! Its in the bushes, under a rock near  <br/>
&gt; where 3<br/>
&gt; fences meet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Box #4<br/>
&gt; Continue toward the traffic but dont cross the street. You want to  <br/>
&gt; head<br/>
&gt; west. Take the street named after the artist who painted Woman in a  <br/>
&gt; Purple Coat<br/>
&gt; , travel a short distance on the street named after the artist who  <br/>
&gt; painted <br/>
&gt; Gabrielle and Clude then take a right on the street named after the  <br/>
&gt; Cubist who<br/>
&gt; painted Cote dAzure. Find a path at 2037 and take it to the T.  <br/>
&gt; Go a<br/>
&gt; short distance north to E26. Eleven feet directly behind E26, under a  <br/>
&gt; rock<br/>
&gt; that is a little larger than all the rest, is box #4.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To get back to your car, follow the path in a northerly direction.  <br/>
&gt; Recognize<br/>
&gt; where you are? Good, then you can find your way back yourself!!<br/>
