impossible to find.  Please let me know where you are experiencing <br/>
the difficulties so I can evaluate whether or not to change the <br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks have indicated that they don't know where to start while <br/>
others have problems finding the first box.  Which is more <br/>
prevalent?  <br/>
<br/>
Sarah told me from day one that the clues were too difficult.  I <br/>
stuck by them because I like the idea that the you have to <br/>
understand the story to find the boxes.  However, I mixed real <br/>
landmarks with semi-fictional ones and confused everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Please give me specifics as to what parts of the clue confuse you <br/>
and I will take a look.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
