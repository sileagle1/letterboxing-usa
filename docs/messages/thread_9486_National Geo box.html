sound (and very curly inside) this afternoon.  As I mentioned earlier, I <br/>
think people may be confused as to which boxes to count, those along the <br/>
wall or the square tiles on the ground.  Counting either one brings you <br/>
close to a junction box and a grate.  We chose the wrong set to count twice <br/>
and found only a little hole dug under the box.  However, upon counting the <br/>
other squares, we found a second junction box and the letterbox safely and <br/>
more cleanly underneath.  I think this location is better than the other <br/>
"counterfeit" dug up one anyway as this one is by "plant material" which <br/>
would not be changed as often as that by the wrong one.  Trying to make <br/>
sense without giving too much away!  (however, the offer still stands to <br/>
have ANYONE tell us where the Froggy boxes 1 and 3 or the Glencarlyn dog <br/>
park boxes are!...)  BeMa<br/>

&gt;I assume the "Einstein" refers to the letterbox called Orion the<br/>
&gt;Hunter at the Einstein memorial in DC.  Here's the link:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was worried that Egypt and Nat. Geographic would not last long.<br/>
&gt;I'll check it out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Enjoy,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; OK, well Tammy and I braved the holiday traffic Saturday and<br/>
&gt; &gt; went to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; DC!  The Smithsonian box is so cool!  I felt like a spy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; surreptitiously pocketing the canister and then casually<br/>
&gt; &gt; walking past<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the guards to sit in the lobby, out of the rain to stamp in!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; While we were there we found the Einstein box and tried for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; at the National Geographic offices, but it was missing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Have fun everyone, these are great!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Please enlighten: What and where is the Einstein letterbox? I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't find it listed anyplace.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And yes, collecting the Smithsonian stamp is cool, just walking<br/>
&gt; &gt; through the bag-check with it in your pocket! No one seemed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; pay any attention to what I was doing in the lobby, and there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; plenty of benches there. A fun box all around.<br/>
