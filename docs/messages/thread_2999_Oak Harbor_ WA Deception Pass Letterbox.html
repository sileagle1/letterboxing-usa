<br/>
Deception Pass Letterbox<br/>
Oak Harbor, WA<br/>
Planted 8/3/01<br/>
By Amanda from Seattle<br/>
<br/>
The Deception Pass State Park is located 9 miles north of Oak Harbor <br/>
on SR 20.  The Deception Pass Bridge offers spectacular views.<br/>
<br/>
Enter the park from the Southern entrance.  Go to the North Beach <br/>
area.  From the Parking area, to the right of the restrooms is a <br/>
stone cairn marking a trailhead.  Go north down this trail to a <br/>
picnic shelter.  Continue northwest to the Beach for views of the <br/>
Bridge. (the Bridge was built in 1935 and is 182 feet high)  At the <br/>
farthest North concrete firepit and picnic benches, go back toward <br/>
the woods, take the trail at 60 degrees.  15 steps up the trail and <br/>
there will be a large boulder on your right.  (approx. 8 ft. tall)  <br/>
Behind and under this boulder is the letterbox.<br/>
