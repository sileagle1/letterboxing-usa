Placed by: Wild Child<br/>
Number of boxes: 1<br/>
Date: March 20, 2003<br/>
City: Brookings<br/>
County: Curry<br/>

<br/>
Eight-year-old Wild Child has planted her first letterbox (gee, her parents <br/>
are so proud)!  An alternative name for this box could be “Bombs Away Bonus <br/>
Box,” since we planted it after being lured to Ryan’s “Bombs Away” LB.  As <br/>
he suggested, the drive up this 13-mile gravel road takes about an hour--so <br/>
we decided to sweeten the deal by dropping another box in the area.  <br/>
<br/>
Directions: From the south end of the Chetco River bridge on Highway 101 in <br/>
Brookings, turn inland onto South Bank Road. Follow this road five miles, <br/>
then fork right onto gravel Mount Emily Road, and follow "Bombsite Trail" <br/>
signs for 13 twisty, uphill miles to the trailhead sign.  Park at the big <br/>
wooden “Wheeler Creek” sign.  <br/>
<br/>
Clues: Standing about ten feet in front of the Wheeler Creek sign, take a <br/>
compass reading of 260.  This points to a redwood that’s not half the tree it <br/>
used to be.  The tree cradles the LB, tucked under pieces of bark.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(From here, the trailhead that leads to the bomb site and Ryan’s LB is a <br/>
short walk up the road.)<br/>
<br/>
If you remember, you might drop a note to the LBNA list-serve or to <br/>
pnwexplr@aol.com if you find this box—we don’t know when we’ll get back to <br/>
check on it. <br/>
