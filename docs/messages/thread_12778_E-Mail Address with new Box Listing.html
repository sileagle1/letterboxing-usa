to the new box records for contact e-mail address?<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I have found with the new system that if a box is <br/>
placed by a user name that I don't recognize and they don't give an e-<br/>
mail address in the clues, there is no way to get in touch with that <br/>
person with questions about the box or if you find the box and it is <br/>
in need of attention.<br/>
<br/>
With the old system, there was always a clue post to go back to, <br/>
although it is true that if significant time had passed, the e-mail <br/>
may have been obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
I think most people just don't think about putting their e-mail <br/>
address in the body of their clues.  If there was a field on the <br/>
entry form, it would prompt them for this information, and I think <br/>
most would be okay with providing it.  It could be an optional field <br/>
if some do not wish to give out their e-mail address.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious if how other people felt about this?<br/>

Now the question will be how long before this reaches the top of the <br/>

patience, is after all, a virtue...  (so they say).<br/>
