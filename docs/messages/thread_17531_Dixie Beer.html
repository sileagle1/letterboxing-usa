Glad you enjoyed it!  Not sure when that hill was created<br/>
because it wasn't there when I lived in N.O. many years ago.<br/>
In fact, that whole Arboretum trail didn't exist.  The tallest<br/>
natural elevation in N.O. used to be Monkey Hill, but I think<br/>
this hill has it beat.  I figured when placing a box in<br/>
a town at or below sea level, I need all the elevation I can get!<br/>
Can't wait to look for yours next time I visit.<br/>
