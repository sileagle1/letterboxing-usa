&gt;Now for the log books.  I've seen some unlined<br/>
&gt;"journal" types of books out there.  Really nice, but the problem is<br/>
&gt;they are expensive.  I've seen some for over $100.  Now that's a lot<br/>

&gt;that's reasonably priced?<br/>
<br/>
Both Borders and Barnes &amp; Noble have journals/sketch books with unlined <br/>
pages that might work for you. They have inexpensive cloth bound ones as <br/>
well as nicer leather bound ones, ranging in price from $5 to $30. Make <br/>
sure the pages are unlined, though, since they don't always tell you on the <br/>
cover and you can't always tell if the book is shrinkwrapped.<br/>
<br/>
Art supply stores also have bound sketch books, usually with black covers, <br/>
that work well as journals.<br/>
<br/>
Another consideration in choosing a journal is to remember that a stiff <br/>
cover will often let you get a better image when stamping into it -- often <br/>
when you're out on the trails, a soft cover doesn't give you a firm enough <br/>
surface on which to stamp the page, and there's no flat surface on which <br/>
you can set down the journal.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently stopped at a Borders and picked up a pretty<br/>
decent sized journal on clearence for $5. Doug is<br/>
correct, there are all styles and price ranges. You<br/>
just have to look. I actually use a small artists pad<br/>
and cut and paste (the old fashioned way) the images<br/>
later. this lets me take as many impressions as I need<br/>
of a stamp until I get a good one, and I can group<br/>
them together if I want. Cyclonic had re-done his log<br/>
book this way and I really likd it.<br/>
