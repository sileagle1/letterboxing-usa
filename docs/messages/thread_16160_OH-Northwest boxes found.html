<br/>
Three Dog Night<br/>
<br/>
We found a green plastic bag (like the ones you get at the grocery) where the box should have been.  Inside was a few sheets of paper from previous finders and we added a sheet also.  No stamp but we counted it anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
Beaver Creek<br/>
<br/>
This one is safe and sound as of 9/28/03.  We were first finders, which was a first.<br/>
<br/>
We found the Van Wert box as well.<br/>
<br/>
Skeeter<br/>
<br/>
Skeeter and Three Dog Night should switch places (if Three Dog had a stamp).  Skeeter is safe and dry.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to make it to Chilicothe the weekend of the 18th.<br/>
