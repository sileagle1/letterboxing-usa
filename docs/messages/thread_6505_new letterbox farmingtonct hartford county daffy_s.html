    My first plant is located in the DEP Farmington Headquarters <br/>
property<br/>
on Rt. 6 in Farmington. Look for Smokey Bear 0.4mi west of New Britain<br/>
Ave or 0.7 mi east of Rt 177. During the week parking's allowed inside<br/>
the gate from 8am-3pm, on weekends there is limited parking at the <br/>
gate.<br/>
Easy hike can be done in an hour or less, good for children. <br/>
     Head for the pond and enter white blazed trail at the empty map<br/>
holder. Follow white blazes' except where there are brown trail signs<br/>
with arrows, this is a loop hike an the arrows will guide you. At the<br/>
north end of the pond head east over a wooden bridge and in little <br/>
while<br/>
the trail goes north again on an old woods road. You'll soon come to <br/>
the<br/>
beginning of the loop, follow the brown trail sign east up a small <br/>
hill<br/>
(this is as strenuous as it gets). You'll notice numbers on the trees <br/>
to<br/>
correspond with the interpretive map. Just before #8 you'll pass <br/>
through<br/>
a very small pine cathedral and might run into a patch of poison ivy <br/>
on<br/>
the trail, I bushwhacked a bit to be safe and then the trail goes down<br/>
hill. At sign #9 follow the trail sign to the right and you'll come <br/>
into<br/>
a meadow with a flagpole on your right and a picnic table straight <br/>
ahead.<br/>
Standing with your back to #10 you'll see a large pine to the east <br/>
with<br/>
fallen, rotted logs underneath. Tucked between two of these logs you<br/>
should find Daffy, be sure to poke with a stick to get rid of <br/>
unwelcome<br/>
visitors. Log in on the bench or picnic table and re-hide carefully.<br/>
Continue on white to another left trail sign and another wooden bench<br/>
then another trail sign on the right which puts you back on the woods<br/>
road and soon you pass the backside of the trail sign where you began <br/>
the<br/>
loop. Continue on the white for one more white trail sign and back to<br/>
your car. Thank you for stopping by.<br/>
