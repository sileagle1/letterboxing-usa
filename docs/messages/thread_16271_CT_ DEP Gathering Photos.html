                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just added a new folder under the photos link and added a couple <br/>
photos from the DEP gathering, including the requested Toad Dog pic's <br/>
with Butterfly's hat.  I wish I could have taken a better picture of <br/>
Don Smith, we have spent some time chasing his stamps and appreciate <br/>
his work.  Sorry I wanted to get them on the web sooner, work really <br/>
interferes with my personal life.  To whom it may concern, if I'm off <br/>
work I'll be at a winter icebreaker gather, New England doesn't get <br/>
cold enough to keep me inside!!<br/>
