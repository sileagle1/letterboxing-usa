I checked high and low on and in the tree for Thanksgiving but could <br/>
not find.  What an interesting tree!  I hope the box didn't fall into <br/>
it's belly!<br/>
<br/>
"Lost Loon" I really messed up on.  There are two trailheads for the <br/>
named trail.  I was able to re-orient using the "Bear Cub" on the <br/>
tree but it was all for naught.  The "Y" tree came up bare then I <br/>
really got fuddled with the second location.<br/>
<br/>
It is however a Beautiful park with some very good fern species <br/>
represented.<br/>
<br/>
Could the reason "Lost Loon" was not listed on the regular site be <br/>
that the boxes are missing?<br/>
<br/>
I would love to tackle this one again if someone can confirm the <br/>
boxes are in place and that I am am aimless wandering fool :-D!<br/>

IF you found the black bear cub, there are no other choices before Loon #1.<br/>

This next can't be missed unless the post is missing.........<br/>
Continue your trek until you reach a white capped 'Trail Head' post.<br/>
<br/>
Go 280 degrees from the top of this post.<br/>
(put your compass on top of the post and go 280 degrees)<br/>
<br/>
The next decision is.............<br/>
Shun 'Service' in favor of 180 degrees.<br/>
<br/>
(while walking on the 180 degree trail choice)<br/>
Go 270 when you can.<br/>
(take the first trail you find that heads off at 270 degrees)<br/>

All three boxes placed in Priest Point Park box were there on May <br/>
28th.<br/>
<br/>
They were among the more difficult finds of our WA-OR trip as <br/>
you can be looking directly at the hiding spot and see no sign of <br/>
the box.<br/>
