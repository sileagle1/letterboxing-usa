&gt; Just thought I'd add some wise words from Rick Simpson.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "... we all put a lot of time and energy into our boxes, and we<br/>
&gt; should realize that once you plant a box, you loose control.     <br/>
&gt; It's no longer a personal keepsake. It's not on a shelf in your <br/>
&gt; house.    <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your box takes on a life of it's own. It's constantly interacting<br/>
&gt; with the elements, animals and other boxers. Things can and will go<br/>
&gt; wrong, but things also go wonderfully right most of the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The whole LB community is based on a gift of sharing with strangers,<br/>
&gt; which inherently has risk. There is no reward without the risk."<br/>
<br/>
Very well put!  In case something does go missing, in addition to<br/>
stamping the image, I take a photo of the whole LB; box, log, little<br/>
felt pouch, first finder gift.  I'll always have my little photo album<br/>
to remember it by.  And the lovely notes left in my inbox, and in the<br/>
logs that do survive the test of time are indeed a great reward for the<br/>
effort.  Thank you!<br/>
