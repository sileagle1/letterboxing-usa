                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was sneaking around in the woods on top of Elk Mound (near Eau Claire, WI) on Sunday, looking for a <br/>
hiding place for this letterbox. I thought I'd found a nice spot, one of the few level places on top of <br/>
the steep hill, but then I walked a little farther. Not 10 feet away there was a suspicious-looking <br/>
plastic container. It was a geocache! Right near where I'd wanted to hide my letterbox! Well, my stamp <br/>
was already made and my box was ready, so I wasn't going to give up and go home, but now I had to <br/>
worry about hiding my box not only from casual hikers, drunken teenagers and wild animals, but also <br/>
eagle-eyed geocachers! <br/>
<br/>
Setting off in another direction on the hilltop I encountered some mysterious flowerpots with plastic <br/>
bags over them - perhaps some kind of high-school biology experiment? Slug traps? Who knows? But <br/>
I'm sure someone would be back to inspect the pots periodically, so that area was off-limits, too. The <br/>
hilltop is not very large or flat on top, so I was worried it would be impossible to hide the letterbox <br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
Finally I found a decent hiding place. At least a letterbox doesn't have to be visible in the same way <br/>
that a geocache or a biology experiment does. If you follow the clues, you'll know exactly where to <br/>
look under the log, even if the box is completely hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else found themselves beaten to a good hiding place? <br/>

Ascend the eponymous prominence. Stand for a moment of silence for the dead letter officers. Look to <br/>
your right around the corner for a place to sit. Continue slightly to the left - you're getting warmer - <br/>
but walk past this warm place a little farther to a fallen log. The letterbox is hidden at the end of <br/>
this log. <br/>
