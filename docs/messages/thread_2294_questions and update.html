difficult re: clue difficulty and terrain?  We just put up a new<br/>
Shieling Forest letterbox this morning and we're trying to write the<br/>
clues now.  I'm thinking what's moderate for us may be really easy for<br/>
someone else and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, the Shieling Forest letterbox has a great collection of<br/>
stamps in it now!  Wow!  And a couple of people from Rochford<br/>
(Rockford?), England even visited it, though they didn't stamp up<br/>
because they didn't have a stamp pad on them.  Too cool!  I'm<br/>
wondering if I should replace the book now because it would be a great<br/>
loss if anything were to happen to that box.  Have any of you replaced<br/>
your books yet?<br/>
<br/>
Bonnie's Shieling Forest letterbox is definitely not there anymore -<br/>
we checked all around that area.<br/>
