When you do use your personal stamp, do you sign your name?  Or is this <br/>

I have a mini sig stamp used for those oh-so-tiny logbooks out there.  <br/>
It would be easy to use for exchanges...hmmmm...<br/>

I started the game rather a lot later and found that exchanges were a  <br/>
good excuse for me to walk up to people and say hello. Now yes, I  <br/>
could do that without the exchange, but it breaks the ice nicely,  <br/>
especially for those of us who can be a bit shy at first and find  <br/>
themselves in a new group of people who already know each other, lol.  <br/>
You could always have an exchange stamp separate from your sig stamp  <br/>
- I recently lost my sig stamp and am considering carving separate  <br/>
stamps for Fs and Es.<br/>

I like that idea a lot.  We've been using a family stamp but the family <br/>
is not as interested (and too busy with school and work during the <br/>
week) so I'm working on a sig stamp and trail name just for me.  If I <br/>
do that, I think I'll continue to use the family stamp for exchanges <br/>
and keep my individual sig stamp more secret.  I like the idea of <br/>
exchanges only done on the trail...but maybe something small and simple <br/>
(one color ink) could be used for gatherings.  Hmmm...lots to think <br/>
about.  SpringChick, your idea of different exchange stamps for each <br/>
events sounds like fun.  People will be lining up at each event to <br/>
collect the new one!  <br/>

Well I'm not sure about that, but it does give me a reason to carve up some of the images I've been squirreling away in a folder for *potential* sig stamps.  I also noticed that at gatherings, particularly when you have been to several gatherings in your area and are using the same sig stamp year after year, you miss out on some of the exchange activity and mingling because most of the people there already have your stamp and vice versa.  This is just my way of trying to keep it fresh and new.<br/>

See, I guess I can't even picture trail exchanges; how do you initiate<br/>
one? We were out a month or so ago, for a fairly new box, and saw that<br/>
another boxer (let's call them 'Frogs With Things') had just been<br/>
there. So when we got back to the trailhead there was another couple<br/>
there, I started chatting with our three year-old, using the words<br/>
'Frogs with things' loudly enough for them to hear. No such luck.<br/>
<br/>
Do you actually have to catch the other boxer at the box to know what<br/>
they're up to, out in the woods?<br/>
<br/>

Generally the few times I have run into other letterboxers on the trail (only a few times), they have been at the box or in the process of searching for it, looking very suspicious.  My first trail exchange came about when I came past the point on the trail where I knew there was a letterbox (I had found it earlier) and there was an elderly woman just standing there looking off into the woods toward the place where the box as.  I glanced back there and the rest of her family was huddled down around the box.  It was pretty easy to surmise what they were up to, although grandma didn't really seem to know what they were doing.  Another time I overheard a father and son team who were headed to the same box I was reading from the clues at each turn in the trail.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people use a catch-phrase question, something like which way is north and if the person answers a certain way, they are a letterboxer.  I guess it wouldn't work with me because I'm not even sure of the question, let alone the answer.  When I read about it on the list, I remember not really getting it so I guess that's probably why I don't remember.  But hey, whatever works I guess.<br/>

Not that there are many around here, but that sort of makes it a more challenging hunt, sort of like the boxes themselves. It is in the clues, I suppose.<br/>

<br/>
I've run into other boxers a few times AT a box.  Met one family when they were at my box; met MizScarlet when I was stamping into HER box (sitting in my car minding my own business &amp; all of a sudden this woman in a hat is knocking on my window. Scared the living daylights out of me). And another couple who were searching for the same box we were looking for--we just asked if they were letterboxers.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was another couple (let's call them "Punk Panther &amp; Black Swine")...  I was coming down the trail from a box, they were coming up the trail--she &amp; I were eyeing the cluesheets in each other's hand, we got just past each other &amp; then both of us kind of circled around &amp; stopped &amp; said, "Are YOU....???"  =)<br/>

I ran into "Frogs with Things"(I feel an homage comming on) on the trail a few weeks ago. I <br/>
had never met them but here was a woman tramping though the woods on week day <br/>
clutching a piece of paper and holding a compass, a dead give away. <br/>
I aways chat with people I meet on trail. If I think they might be boxers I just ask. If I get a <br/>
puzzled look and a "what's that?" I just say "oh it's just a game we're playing."<br/>

<br/>
The only trail exchange we have done was fun.  We walked up towards a<br/>
box we were revisiting (with a HH to plant) when we noticed someone<br/>
quietly walking away from the hiding spot.  We each said hello and<br/>
kept walking in opposite directions.  We did not head straight for the<br/>
box not wanting to get "caught" or give away the actual spot but kept<br/>
walking slowly.  One of my children looked back down the trail and<br/>
whispered, "She's still there and watching us, mom."  I looked, she<br/>
was still there so I turned around and approached her.  I didn't know<br/>
what to say so just asked, "Do you have a Sig Stamp?"  She smiled and<br/>
said that she did have a stamp.  We took it from there and ended up<br/>
meeting a very nice fellow LBer.  I'm thinking we'll just look for<br/>
people who look a lot like us in the woods...and take a chance sometimes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; See, I guess I can't even picture trail exchanges; how do you initiate<br/>
&gt; &gt; one? <br/>
&gt; &gt; Do you actually have to catch the other boxer at the box to know what<br/>
&gt; &gt; they're up to, out in the woods?<br/>

Never happen. I mean, even beyond the climate of secrecy that the LB<br/>
community seems to have (which I think, generally and without<br/>
reopening long, drawn-out discussions, is a good thing), there's my<br/>
terminal shyness. If I asked someone if they were a letterboxer and<br/>
they said no I'd scurry away as fast as my legs would take me.<br/>

I believe that related to the LbNA logo where the N has an arrow head  <br/>
under it, similar to a compass pointer.<br/>
