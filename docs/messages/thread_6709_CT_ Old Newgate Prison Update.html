                    <html><body>Greetings,
<br/>
<br/>This series of boxes was a very enjoyable hike and search, though it was a bit frustrating at times. All four boxes eventually were uncovered, and it is clear that we weren't the only people to go astray on the trail. Some boxers had found some boxes, but not others. All four boxes were in great shape, and apparantly, at some point earlier this year, the stamps got messed up. The Gods of Letterboxing, Wanda and Pete, wrote in one of the logbooks that they were going to fix it, and they certainly did, as all the stamps were in the right place for us.
