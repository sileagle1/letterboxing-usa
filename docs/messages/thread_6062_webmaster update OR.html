                    <div class="plaintext-content">Little did I know that the dry sandy path I walked in February would be a thriving wetland in July, complete <br/>
with kingfishers and swimming ducks. Who knew? Please use the following as the revised clue:<br/>
<br/>
On  February 13, 2002 Funhog placed the Sandy Delta Letterbox in the Columbia River Gorge. This box is <br/>
near the town of Troutdale, in Multnomah County, Oregon.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: From Portland take Hwy 84 east to exit 18 (Lewis and Clark State Park.) At the stop <br/>
sign turn right. Go under the underpasses and park at the green metal gate straight ahead. Be careful <br/>
not to get back on the freeway! The letterbox is about a forty five minute stroll from your car, one way. <br/>
Be prepared for the possibility of wet feet.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: A short distance after you pass through the green metal gate, turn left at a narrow <br/>
dirt road. Stay on this road past a couple of seasonal ponds. Once you find yourself beneath three sets <br/>
of three go with the flow, some above, some below. Eventually, the path turns to the right. Find a bright <br/>
yellow warning post with a riverside view. From this post go back the way you came eighty steps. The <br/>
letterbox is twenty four steps away at three times thirty three. <br/>

As I recall from last year, though, the Wapiti box isn't actually <br/>
accessible during Zoolights, only during the day when the zoo is <br/>
officially open for viewing animals!<br/>
<br/>
But Zoolights is pretty cool too, and definitely worth the visit.  =)<br/>

Thank you, Funhog!!  The zoo boxes were our first attempts at letterboxing, unfortunately we didn't know that all but one were missing at the time.  And after being discouraged about not finding those we didn't even attempt the remaining one still there! &lt;g&gt;  Do you know if the others will be replaced as well?</body></html>
