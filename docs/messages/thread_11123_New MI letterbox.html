Neutered dogs are Good Dogs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(#3 in the Dog Scouts of America Good Dog series)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The clues for finding the letterboxes in this series all have to do with<br/>
creating a good dog.  To decode the clues, answer the puzzle<br/>
questions that appear before each clue section to fill in the blank.<br/>
For more information about neutering your dog see the Dog Scouts of<br/>
America web site www.dogscouts.org <http: www.dogscouts.org=""></http:> .  Please<br/>
visit our other letterboxes in the area:  Good Dogs are Socialized, Good<br/>
Dogs are Trained, and Good Dogs are Contained.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This letterbox is in the Lost Twin Lakes Hiking Area.  This is a<br/>
beautiful Au Sable State Forest,  with lots of huge and very old White<br/>
Pine and Red Pine trees.  If youre like me, you wont be able to keep<br/>
from stopping frequently to admire their majestic appearance.  Answer<br/>
the True/False questions to test your knowledge about neutering and the<br/>
effect it has on a dog, then put the answer in the blank line of the<br/>
sentence clue below it.<br/>

______________ sign.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your female dog should have a litter of puppies before you spay her<br/>
because it will settle her down.<br/>

wives tale mean anything to you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
F  73  (and try not to get very attached to your dog).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will arrive at one of the blue, triangular pathway markers after<br/>
about ______ steps.  This will tell you if you went the right way<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Neutering your female dog will eliminate heat periods, so that your back<br/>
yard will not be a stray dog magnet, when she is in season.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
T  107  <br/>
<br/>
F  52   (and you might want to put an 8 foot fence around your backyard.<br/>
If its chain link, make it a double fence (dogs can do amazing things<br/>
through a fence when their sex organs are doing the thinking for them).<br/>
Dont forget to bury it two feet into the ground, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep going on down the trail until you are standing amongst some trees<br/>
with burls on them, that look diseased.  This will be roughly _______<br/>
steps.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Neutering your male dog will take away his desire to do<br/>
testosterone-driven behaviors, like humping things, scent marking<br/>

smell of a female in heat (roaming).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
T  114  <br/>
<br/>
F  71   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

In another ______ steps, you will come to a tree with the blue hiking<br/>
pathway triangles on both sides.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Neutering your dog means that you will not be contributing to the pet<br/>
overpopulation problem, causing millions of dogs and cats to be put to<br/>
death each year, because there are not enough homes to care for all of<br/>
the unwanted puppies and accidental litters.<br/>
