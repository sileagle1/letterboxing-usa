"Richmond" has crept back in under the "County" category for my <br/>
mystery boxes, Birdwatching and Cattails. Please change it again to a <br/>
question mark. Ladybug planted her mystery boxes at the same place, <br/>
and presumably "Richmond" should be removed from her listing as well, <br/>
but I don't want to speak for her.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that there IS a Richmond COUNTY, but these boxes are <br/>
in the area of the CITY of Richmond. If memory serves, Richmond <br/>
County is in the Tidewater area, and these boxes are in Central <br/>
Virginia. They're mystery boxes, but I wouldn't want to mislead <br/>
anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your assist.<br/>
