<br/>
Our first hunt for letterboxing was a success.  Although, one of our <br/>
hunts we did not find the box.  We still carried on, in hopes of <br/>
finding our third.. and we did!  This is so addicting.  I think "us" <br/>
parents are more addicted then the kids.. LOL<br/>
We did a family friendly one at Hertiage Park in Adrian Michigan <br/>
close to our home with our 3 kids.  I bought notebooks with plastic <br/>
type covers for the kids and each of them have their very own stamp.  <br/>
I made<br/>
sure to buy smaller type stamps, not to take up too much room on the <br/>
letterbox journals.<br/>
I really believe that the kids carrying their own journal is really <br/>
an awesome idea.. Our soon to be 4thgrader and 2and grader will be <br/>
able to work on those reading and writing skills with out much fuss <br/>
from them.<br/>
:)<br/>
Thank you all for all the great "hunts"<br/>
We can't wait to beable to hide one of our own<br/>
Peace,<br/>
