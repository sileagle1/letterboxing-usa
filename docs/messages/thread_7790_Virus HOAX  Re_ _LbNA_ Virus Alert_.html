&gt;Hello Everyone,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry to do this to you but a  friend of mine just found out that she had <br/>
&gt;a virus attach itself to her address book and when I checked my computer, <br/>
&gt;I found that it was there.  I am sending you what she sent to me.  I am <br/>
&gt;very sorry for the inconvenience.<br/>

&gt;Hello Everyone,<br/>
&gt;       I am very sorry to let you know this but I may have infected you <br/>
&gt; with an email virus. I received an email today that told me of a virus <br/>
&gt; that is circulating and using peoples address books to do so. I checked <br/>
&gt; my computer using the procedure below and found that I had it. So, in <br/>
&gt; turn, since you are in my address book, you may have it too. It is not <br/>
&gt; detected by McAfee and Norton. The instructions to check for and remove <br/>
&gt; it are very simple and take hardly no time at all.<br/>
&gt;       Once again, I am very sorry for the inconvenience but I guess this <br/>
&gt; is just technology today.<br/>
&gt;             Kimberly<br/>
&gt;Here are the instructions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1.  Go to Start, click on Find or Search option.<br/>
&gt;2.  In the Files/Folders option, write the name jdbgmgr.exe<br/>
&gt;3. Be sure you search your C:drive and any other drive you may have.<br/>
&gt;4.  Click 'Find Now'<br/>
&gt;5.  The virus has a teddy bear icon with the name jdbgmbr.exe DO NOT OPEN IT.<br/>
&gt;6.  Go to edit.  Choose 'Select All' to highlight the file without opening <br/>
&gt;it.<br/>
&gt;7.  Now go to 'File' and select 'Delete'.  It will then go to the Recycle <br/>
&gt;Bin.<br/>
&gt;8.  Go to the 'Recycle Bin' and delete it there as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;IF YOU FIND THE VIRUS YOU MUST CONTACT ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR ADDRESS BOOK <br/>
&gt;SO THEY CAN ERADICATE IT IN THEIR OWN ADDRESS BOOKS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry about this.  Apparently, because I've found it, everyone in my <br/>
&gt;Address Book will have it as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;To contact these people<br/>
&gt;1. Open new e-mail message.<br/>
&gt;2.  Click the photo of Address Book next to 'To'.<br/>
&gt;3.  Click every name and add it to BCC.<br/>
&gt;4.  Copy this message, enter Subject, paste to e-mail and Send.<br/>
