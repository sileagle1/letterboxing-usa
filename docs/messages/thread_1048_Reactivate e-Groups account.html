Most mailing list server programs have some sort of "bounce management"<br/>
program that deals with bad addresses. Essentially a threshold is set<br/>
(number of bounces in a given period of time), and once it is reached the<br/>
program unsubscribes you from the list and sends a message such as the<br/>
one you received. The problem that caused your address to bounce is most<br/>
likely to be related to your ISP's mail server having temporary<br/>
difficulty, but it could also be anywhere in between egroups and your<br/>
mail account. Generally, these problems go away if there is no real<br/>
problem with your address and you can just subscribe again using whatever<br/>
method the message told you to do. However if there are many others on<br/>
the list that got such a message, it would be more likely the problem had<br/>
something to do with the egroups mailing list server. Hope that helps.<br/>
