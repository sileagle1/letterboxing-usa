                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a word of cution:  Today we did the "Sound of Music" series on <br/>
the bike trail in West Kingston, RI, and our bikes were stolen <br/>
(recovered, thankfully!) when we went to get the last box.   We had <br/>
biked in to a spot where the trail branches...fairly deep in the <br/>
woods...then we left our bikes to hike another 100 feet or so.  <br/>
(Which was stupid and will never be done again!!) When we came back <br/>
5 minutes later, no sign of the bikes.  We figured we had been <br/>
followed, because our bikes were not able to be seen from the main <br/>
bike trail.   Long story short, we found the bikes hidden/ditched <br/>
near the new park at the end of the bike trail.  A couple of kids <br/>
(about 12 years old) were near the park, kind of lurking at the edge <br/>
of the woods, and led me to both bikes.  I think those two were left <br/>
behind by a larger group who took the bikes and ran off.  My husband <br/>
recalls some kids being way behind us on the bike trail.  I'm sure <br/>
it was kids because rather than making off with thousands of dollars <br/>
worth of mountain bikes, they took a little bag attached to the <br/>
frame of my bike that had a few beach pebbles in it.<br/>
<br/>
Side note: The "Sol" box in the series is completely drenched.  <br/>
Unfortunately, we didn't have a "repair kit" with us, so we dried it <br/>
out as best we could.  It needs a new log book though.<br/>
