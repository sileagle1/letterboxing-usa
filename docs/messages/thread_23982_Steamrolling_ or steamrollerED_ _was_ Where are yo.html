Oh, trust me, if retailers could figure out a way to get folks shopping<br/>
on Thanksgiving too, the stores would be open.  Not to mention X-mas<br/>
and Gnu Year's Day...<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yes, it would be nice if you could take everyday off to spend with <br/>
&gt; your family in the great outdoors, but you can't, that is just the <br/>
&gt; way it is. <br/>
<br/>
Didn't suggest that (it would be somewhat impractical, and probably get<br/>
old after a while)...just that it would be nice for employers to offer<br/>
their wage slaves a nice LONG two-day holiday (imagine!  Two days off<br/>
in a row!) now and again.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Even FDR, the great socialist, knew the importance of the consumer <br/>
&gt; economy as he wanted to move Thanksgiving up in November to extend <br/>
&gt; the holiday shopping season (not that it matters these days).<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, he must have been smoking something funny that day...he was<br/>
perhaps a "good socialist" but judging from this, not "great"!  ;-p<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I would rather we have the steam rolling economy then the double<br/>
&gt; digit unemployment and low growth rate of the European nations...<br/>
<br/>
See, and I'd rather we all just enjoy one another's company and forget<br/>
about the mindless, endless consumerism once in a while.  We're not<br/>
doing this planet a favor by constantly creating and buying "new and<br/>
improved" geegaws (so we can throw last month's geegaw in a landfill).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Oh, wait, I'm doing it...<br/>
&gt; Have a Happy Thanksgiving!<br/>
&gt; (and do lots of shopping tomorrow!)<br/>

You have a Happy Thanksgiving too!  Try not to get trampled this<br/>
weekend!<br/>

I guess you missed the advertising going on the past few days - "Beat<br/>
the crowds, shop at StuffMart all day Thursday."<br/>
<br/>
That bugged me. I was glad to see that the local fast food joint was<br/>
closed for Thanksgiving. As few people as possible should have to work<br/>
that day.<br/>

I did go letterboxing in Thursday all day and also on Friday. It was nice, even though I <br/>
found only 2 of the 5 boxes I looked for. And I hate shopping, but this wasn't too bad. I <br/>
have 2 more days off but will be at a conference so no shopping for me.<br/>
