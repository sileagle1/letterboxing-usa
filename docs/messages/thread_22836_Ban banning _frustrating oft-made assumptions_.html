                    <div class="plaintext-content">Folks!  Please keep in mind there is a difference between banning and<br/>
placing someone on moderation status to make sure personal or<br/>
inflamatory remarks aren't tearing up the group.  I have seen time and<br/>
again in this group when someone was moderated (and once posts were<br/>
doing well and not inciting huge flames, they were taken off<br/>
moderation) but other members have risen up saying that person was<br/>
"banned."  <br/>
<br/>
The list rarely bans (except for obvious porn and spammers--no<br/>
hesitation there, and you wouldn't believe how much of it you miss),<br/>
but it occasionally moderates when things become too incendiary and<br/>
personal.  Even then, we recognize that most of the time flames die on<br/>
their own. People are not just kicked out, willy-nilly. The policy of<br/>
the list is to stay back most of the time until it becomes too<br/>
personal.  I'm surprised because posts from this list the other day<br/>
were accusing the list of not taking enough steps and now others are<br/>
saying the opposite.  <br/>
<br/>
Can we please get back to letterboxing?  We don't need to start yet<br/>
another flame over assumptions that may be being made.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a thought of mine,<br/>
