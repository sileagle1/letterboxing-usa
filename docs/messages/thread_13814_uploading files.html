the "Files" or "Photo" section on the left side of the Yahoo! Groups <br/>

little "browse" button to locate the picture on your disk, then click <br/>

If the map or photo you want to put online is not in your PC, you <br/>
will either have to take a picture of it with a digital camera or <br/>
scan it to get it into picture mode. I would suggest Jpeg format, as <br/>
the bitmaps take up a HUGE amount of space and there is already a <br/>
shortage of that within the space allotted for our group. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the great step-by-step advice for those who didn't know how <br/>
to upload. I think it will clear up a lot of questions. However, in <br/>
refering to mohmers question, the trick is to set a link in a clue to a <br/>
part of the talk list that is a members-only section. How would one do <br/>
this without being a member to view the link? I'm not sure it's <br/>
possible. The link would instead have to come from an outside source <br/>
that is publically available, unless I'm mistaken. Thanks again though <br/>
for all the help to those who might soon enrich our Files/Photos <br/>
sections!<br/>
