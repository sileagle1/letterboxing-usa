<br/>
I recently found an amazing box, with a fantastically detailed stamp [I really wish I could <br/>
show it to you all so you can see it -- it was a stamp of the painting "American Gothic"!], <br/>
planted as part of a series by The Cottontails. The whole series is on masterpieces of great <br/>
art and the stamps are hand carved reproductions of these masterpieces. I found number <br/>
3 bc it was easiest, but when I asked them about 1 and 2 [so I could be anal and do them <br/>
in order] I was told they had gone missing. And the boxes included sets of markers so you <br/>
could ink your stamp in full color as well as a pricey hardbound sketchbook for a log. And <br/>
while i was sitting in th epicnic shelter in the pouring rain, taking 10 minutes or so to <br/>
color in this stamp, a huge RED FOX trotted right by me and didn't even see me!<br/>
<br/>
It's really a shame, not just for the planter, but for all the letterboxers [and new people like <br/>
me] who would really like to find them.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all the hard work and creativity everyone [almost] goes to in putting these <br/>
boxes out there. I just started in August and I don't know when I have enjoyed a fall this <br/>
much. Every weekend and many days on my lunch hours I am outside in some park or <br/>
forest preserve taking pictures of gorgeous fall foliage, making the rounds of area shops <br/>
and making the acquaintance of local business owners, or stopping into museums I never <br/>
knew were there and learning about the exhibits as I read labels to hunt for clues. <br/>
<br/>
I am also a scrapbooker and while I determined I would NOT make an elaborate, perfect <br/>
album out of this hobby [too much pressure! I do use a mini scrapbook as my log and I <br/>
love taking pictures of beautiful scenery or interesting locations on my searches, and then <br/>
adding one or two of the best shots to the opposite side of the spread featuring the stamp <br/>
and a hand written paragraph or two on the search, the box, the location, the weather, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So I not only have a wonderful little scrapbook album I am creating, but I have also learned <br/>
about certain paintings, ecosystems, how watches are made, who John Kennicott was, and <br/>
more, as well as encountering said fox, a fox snake [soooo cute!], bullfrogs, a 140 year old <br/>
snapping turtle, chipmunks, owls, and more.<br/>
<br/>
So I am really sorry for anyone who loses a box. I really really appreciate them!<br/>

&gt; Here's a thought - how about a running list of "bad letterboxers" <br/>
&gt; somewhere on file?  I went to check on my series of 8 boxes (two of <br/>
&gt; which have recently gone missing) this morning, and found yet <br/>
&gt; another one missing that had been reported found over the weekend.  <br/>
&gt; I only had time before work to check on one other, and it was not <br/>

Their Illinois Cardinal is nice too.  Letterboxing for me is like a huge<br/>

down at the finger paints level.  :-)<br/>
