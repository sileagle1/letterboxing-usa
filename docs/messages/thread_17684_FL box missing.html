&gt; one that was supposed to be stuffed in the big tree by bench was not there <br/>
&gt; and we looked and looked!<br/>

Yeah, I went out there the day after you posted.   I looked and looked, too.  <br/>
 It's gone.   I HATE when that happens.   Sadly, that box had a hitchhiker in <br/>
it the last time i was there, too.   I hope someone got it out before it went <br/>
missing.   But that box never did get too many visitors.   I don't know if it <br/>
was too far out or what.<br/>
<br/>
I've only planted 6 boxes, since September, and two of them have gone missing <br/>
already and one was vandalized.   Not a very good record so far.   :-(<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me know!<br/>
