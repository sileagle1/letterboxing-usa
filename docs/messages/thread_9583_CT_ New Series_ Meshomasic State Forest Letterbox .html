Planted by: Pam<br/>
Planted on: December 7, 2002<br/>
Location: Portland CT (and surrounding towns)<br/>
Rated: Moderate: Hilly and Rocky  (Very Difficult during snow!)<br/>
Number of Letterboxes: 4<br/>
Length of hike: At least two miles.  Allow approximately two-three hours for <br/>
hiking, plus stamping in time.<br/>
<br/>
My Dad has lived near the Meshomasic State Forest all of his life and has <br/>
hiked these portions of the forest on numerous occasions in his youth.  He <br/>
was the one who told me about the Nike Missile Sites and the abandoned <br/>
airplane hanger.<br/>
<br/>
Please be sure to wear waterproof hiking boots all year round, and the LOVELY <br/>
(just kidding!) Orange gear during hunting season.  The trails were quite wet <br/>
and muddy the day I scouted these, and snowy when I planted them!  I will <br/>
apologize in advance for any obscene spray painting that you will find on <br/>
this hike.  Unfortunately, I can not control the not so nice things that <br/>
young people paint.  I would understand if you didn't want to subject your <br/>
kids to this.  Also, be especially careful in the ruins.  Keep children near <br/>
to you since there are many hazards!<br/>
<br/>
Also, during the snowy winter months, these trails are covered with snow <br/>
(obviously!).  The snow makes the trails especially hazardous since you can <br/>
not see the rocks, trees etc underneath the snow.  Please be extra careful!  <br/>
I don't want any injuries!<br/>
