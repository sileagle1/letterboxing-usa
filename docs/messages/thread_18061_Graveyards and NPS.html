                    <div class="plaintext-content">It seems as though when ever we leave town and not checking the computer daily ,conversations tend to get a little tense so this is on the late side. On our trip through Wy., Idaho, and Montana last summer we had the opportunity to spend 1 1/2 days at the Little Big Horn Battlefield. Most folks do a one hour drive through but I wanted to really spend some time there . We had every intention of planting a great stamp that would tend to reflect the Indians point of view. I had the chance to hike part of the area and walk much of the road. It was very near the date of the battle and the heat was pretty stifling. I was able to drink water that I carried with me unlike the lack of water the men of the Seventh Cavalry had to endure. As I passed the white posts (marked where bodies were discovered and buried a few days after the battle) I was able to visualize the flow of the battle and felt the terror, confusion and hopelessness that I'm sure was present during the battle. I have read several books about the battle, but only after reaching down and touching a post did it sink in. I really felt(feel) as though this was(is) sacred ground. When I finally caught up with Gwen it took some time before I could gather my emotions and relate to her what I had experienced, and continue to experience while typing this post. I didn't plant a letterbox, not because of the NPS policy against planting letterboxes but because it just wouldn't feel right and would not have been respectful to either the fallen solders or Indians. I am frankly more concerned about planting letterboxes and playing our GAME in graveyards than in National Parks. Who the heck are we to try to figure out what might be ethical or respectful or in which graveyard to plant a box in. I could care less about a letterboxer that thinks it is cool , there may be some one that doesn't. There are many locations you can use , why choose a spot that many might consider sacred? In so far as National Parks are concerned, those that have multiple purposes  such as the Little Big Horn why not visit and leave nothing ? In other NPS areas if you can't figure out how to plant a letterbox without creating a problem, obvious trail, obvious clues , obvious boxes ,where some non letterboxer might come across it ,then maybe you shouldn't leave anything. If you have been letterboxing for awhile you should know how to set a box up where there will be minimal impact. If the NPS can figure out clues or locate your letterboxes without clues then you should definitely reconsider hiding a letterbox in any National Park. There are many places yet to hide letterboxes that do not create problems.<br/>
