FLORIDA'S 50TH<br/>
Welcome! I've designed this letterbox to be a little bit different from the <br/>
ordinary.  It is meant to commemorate the milestone of the 50th letterbox in <br/>
the State.  To find it you will need two very important pieces of information.<br/>
<br/>
1.  A compass heading<br/>
2.  A distance<br/>
<br/>
Here, I'll provide you with clues to the location of the compass heading.  <br/>
There you'll find clues to a second location, where I've placed the distance. <br/>
 For this adventure you'll of course need a compass as well as a 100 foot <br/>
length of twine, string, rope or line.  Be sure to also bring bug spray.  <br/>
Good luck!  Here are your clues:<br/>
