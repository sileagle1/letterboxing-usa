  I think your stamps and clues are great.  I also would love the <br/>
chance to look at the stamp images at their finest (AFTER finding the <br/>
box).  For the life of me I could not get a clear image of the <br/>
Knowlton letterbox stamp! Too large..no flat rock at hand. <br/>

<br/>
But I don't think any of your stamps qualify as ugly! Maybe I should <br/>
post our first personal stamp - hacked out of an old pink eraser with <br/>
a steak knife one night so we could go on our first letterboxing trip <br/>
the next day. (Patience has never been one of my strong suits).<br/>
