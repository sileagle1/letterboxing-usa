Plainfield, CT<br/>
<br/>
A relatively easy in and out hike along the Quinebaug Trail which is mostly <br/>
old roads with few hills; this portion will take you past Lockes Meadow Pond <br/>
towards Devil's Den and Hell Hallow.  Allot about 1.5-2 hours for 4 miles of <br/>
hiking, searching and general debauchery.  Be wary of the Devil's own <br/>
instruments of recreation: there appears to be an abundance of motorized <br/>
vehicles of destruction, so stay alert...<br/>
<br/>
The entrance to The Road to Hell can be found 0.4 miles south on Spaulding <br/>
Road (which is 1.9 miles west from the intersection of 14A and Route 49.)  <br/>
Parking is at the dirt turn out marking the trail head on the left.  Watch <br/>
for blue blazes.<br/>
<br/>
Begin your journey towards Hell Hallow on the Road to Hell which is <br/>
conveniently marked with the blue blazes.  Wave at Cerberus, if you can spot <br/>
one of his mangy heads, and continue on the trail.  Sneak past the mysterious <br/>
wreckage (they obviously thought this was the Highway to Hell.)  At the first <br/>
intersection go left and then left again (no- you can't go right to Hell, not <br/>
yet anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
At the third intersection there should be a stone wall off to the right.  <br/>
Yup.  Start looking: idle hands are the Devil's playground.<br/>
<br/>
When you continue along the left hand branch ignore all side trails until you <br/>
are faced with Lockes Pond.  Careful of the rocks paving the way:  well <br/>
meaning or not they are still loose.  You will walk around the pond and <br/>
meadow, keeping them both on your left until you reach the Devil's Crossroad. <br/>
 From here take 66 steps right to Hell, then at 6 deg bushwhack in.  Look in <br/>
a shady spot where the devil would not.<br/>
