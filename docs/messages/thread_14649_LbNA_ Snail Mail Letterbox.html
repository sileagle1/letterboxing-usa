                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well...I went to New Hampshire this weekend but didn't get to do any letterboxing. :(  It's not my husband's "thing" and we didn't really have time. My son and I did find a few places that we thought would be a great place for a letterbox. Even commented on how funny it would be to stumble across one without actually looking! Unfortunately that didn't happen! :(  We are going back in a couple of weeks and this time I'm going to make the time to do some letterboxing! <br/>
<br/>
But what a great surprise I got on my return! The Snail Mail Letterbox in my mailbox!!!! I was practically dancing! It will be going on its way shortly! <br/>
