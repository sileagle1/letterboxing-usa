                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone, I am ready to start the list for my next postal<br/>
letterbox. This time I made room for 100 letterboxers. I thought I<br/>
would start to collect the addresses now since that takes the most<br/>
time getting this whole thing together. I hope everyone who wants to<br/>
get this letterbox will cause I don't like leaving people out. I<br/>
sent out the It Postal letterbox today for those of you who are on<br/>
that list to look forward too. And just a reminder not to post your<br/>
address on the list. Just e-mail it to me. There are five people<br/>
that I have already e-mailed who wanted to be on the list for It who<br/>
did not make it and I already have those five written down. So 95<br/>
places left. Hope to hear from many of you soon.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
