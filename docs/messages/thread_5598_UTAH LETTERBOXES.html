<br/>
While visiting Utah last week we were able to connect with two<br/>
letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
The first one we got was Delicate Arch in Moab. Still there and in good<br/>
condition.  <br/>
<br/>
Hitchhiker logbook for Sockeye Salmon by Buckeroo was picked up by me,<br/>
but there was no stamp :(<br/>
<br/>
I will probably copy the image of what the stamp looks like, carve it up<br/>
and then put together the replaced stamp and logbook with a pen and a<br/>
couple ziplocs and go out "visiting" letterboxes with it before dropping<br/>
it someplace for its next driver to find.<br/>
<br/>
I'm very happy to report that Der Mad Stamper's Golden Spike Letterbox<br/>
is alive and well in Promontory, Utah.  It has been rarely visited, but<br/>
the stamp is worth going out of the way for.  The historic site nearby<br/>
is interesting and the hike is windy but nice. <br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>
<br/>
