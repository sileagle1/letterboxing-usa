thanks to all the folks who came from cities far away to play in the <br/>
Kern River Valley.   We both enjoyed meeting and visiting with you <br/>
all.  We got to see what a Buzzard really looks like, and to see a <br/>
real Sierra Sally and to meet Lee and Nancy who had traveled to <br/>
Kernville before to get some of our boxes.  Amanda and Ryan were <br/>
doing a tour of Southern California over the weekend yet had time to <br/>
visit us and plant a box  (we got it on Sunday afternoon, Thanks!).  <br/>
The Jiggs clan had river front lodgings and was a delightful bunch <br/>
and newbies Patti and Earl who are part timers in Kernville, found <br/>
some surprises in the old town. We realize that our valley is not an <br/>
easy place to get to so we appreciate the effort that it took <br/>
everyone to visit us.  Hopefully you will come back for a longer <br/>
stay and to pick up those boxes that time did not permit getting on <br/>
the weekendand find new plants.  We were glad that so many folks <br/>
wanted to raft and that you were able to put aside boxing for a <br/>
while to play on the water.    Thanks for making the weekend so <br/>
successful, thanks for your contributions and most of all thanks for <br/>
your fellowship. <br/>
 We will be off list until May 12th. <br/>
