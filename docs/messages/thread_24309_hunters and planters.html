I checked out your site.  Very nice - I love your<br/>
pets!<br/>
<br/>
I think the Naperville Riverwalk might be a good one<br/>
for me to try.  Its not secluded by any means and in a<br/>
good area.  Do you think this one might be hard for a<br/>
beginner to find?<br/>
<br/>
I bookmarked your site, thank you.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since you're probably kind of freaked by what happened to you, the<br/>
Naperville ones would be a good choice from that point of view.  There are a<br/>
lot of really nice trees, and a nice river, and lots of shopping, lots of<br/>
"eateries", and a nice used book store, plus a chocolate chip cookie dough<br/>
store (!) -- reading and chocolate, can't get a better combination than<br/>
that.  But even with all the trees, it's still very open where ya can see<br/>
everything going on, and generally quite public, even well after dark.  It's<br/>
a very popular walk.  From last I talked to the police down there, crime<br/>
rate is very low.  Also very dog friendly if you have a pooch or two who<br/>
like to go "carsies" and "walksies".  However, due to the steep drop on the<br/>
one side of the captain box down into the pond, I wouldn't attempt that box<br/>
after dark.  And with the raccoon box, that part of the park closes at 10pm.<br/>
<br/>
The downside of them being in so public an area, tho, is the serious need<br/>
for discretion.  The Riverwalk can be intensely popular, particularly this<br/>
time of year, even in the evening. So discretion in finding the boxes is<br/>
important, plus making sure the boxes are absolutely, completely covered<br/>
when they're replaced in their hiding spots.  I'm going to camoflage one of<br/>
them even more by using Michel LeBranch's Secret Patented Stealth Letter<br/>
Box.  So if you happen to find it, remember you're in public, and DO NOT<br/>
SCREAM.  Bring work gloves, tho, because the raccoon box is in a hiding hole<br/>
where it gets pretty dirty.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the clues go, they might be difficult for you.  The "raccoon" box<br/>
seems to be fairly easy with both beginners and veteran boxers.  The<br/>
"captain" box had fewer newbie finders.  Those clues did seem to present a<br/>
problem for people new to boxing, according to the emails we got, especially<br/>
for out-of-towners.<br/>
<br/>
Both Naperville boxes are pulled for spring cleaning but should be back by<br/>
next Sunday.  I'm working on them today since I've got to stay home for<br/>
phone calls anyway.  I'm doing the logbooks a little bit differently on<br/>
these since there were some cool stamps logged in to the box and I'd like<br/>
them to stay in the box, but be a little safer.  I like the Riverwalk, so<br/>
those are two boxes we won't retire unless someone else comes along and<br/>
plants boxes there to bring people there. (Hint! Hint!) But I've never seen<br/>
any other boxes listed anyplace for the Riverwalk.  I don't know about<br/>
geocaches -- I never check the geocache site.<br/>
<br/>
I laminated each of the stamp entries from the previous years and then just<br/>
have them inside a ziplock bag inside the box.  I was going to punch holes<br/>
in them and "bind" them into a logbook, but punching one or more holes into<br/>
the pages would compromise the waterproofing of the lamination.  So I'm just<br/>
leaving the laminated pages loose and thus completely sealed for folks to<br/>
look at.  I think some of the stamps are quite nice so I wanted to protect<br/>
them from weather elements as much as I could while still leaving them in<br/>
the box for people to peruse.  They'll still be lost for good if the boxes<br/>
turn up missing at some point, but at least if someone is negligent about<br/>
closing up the ziplock bags, any water that gets in won't easily ruin the<br/>
pages.  So I figure it's a decent compromise.<br/>
<br/>
I haven't told Pippi what I'm doing with the logbooks (I adopted the boxes<br/>
from Pippi when they left for an extended stay in Africa), but she's my<br/>
sister, so I figure I can get away with it. Besides, I'm bigger than she is.<br/>
Altho Keith (Mr. Pippi) is bigger than I am.  So that might be a problem,<br/>
since Mr. Mosey is as big as Keith is but much older.  Mr. Mosey would make<br/>
a lousy second.  He's no Errol Flynn with a sword.  He's no Antonio Banderas<br/>
either.  Oh well, can't have everything.<br/>

I checked out your site.  Very nice - I love your<br/>
pets!<br/>
<br/>
I think the Naperville Riverwalk might be a good one<br/>
for me to try.  Its not secluded by any means and in a<br/>
good area.  Do you think this one might be hard for a<br/>
beginner to find?<br/>
<br/>
I bookmarked your site, thank you.<br/>

give it a try and planted one of our own.  We had more fun trying to decide <br/>
where, when and what we would do for our box.  Mapping out the directions was a <br/>
blast!   We excitedly check up every couple weeks to see who has dropped in <br/>
on our box.<br/>
