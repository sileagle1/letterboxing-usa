The Bray Loop Metamorphosis Letterboxes (3)<br/>
Holyoke, Massachusetts<br/>
<br/>
Location: Mt. Tom State Reservation, MA<br/>
<br/>
Date placed: 7/28/02 by The L Troop<br/>
Time: About 45 minutes  <br/>
Difficulty: Easy - good for children. <br/>
<br/>
Directions to starting location:<br/>
<br/>
Mt. Tom State Reservation charges a small fee on weekends<br/>
and holidays during the summer season.<br/>
The closest entrance is off US 5 in Holyoke, about 4<br/>
miles north of Easthampton Rd (MA 141). Lake Bray is<br/>
a short distance past the kiosk.  The parking <br/>
area is immediately past the lake, on the left.   <br/>
<br/>
The other entrance to the Reservation is on MA 141<br/>
at the Holyoke/Easthampton boundary, across from the Log<br/>
Cabin and Harvest Valley restaurants proceed<br/>
uphill for about 1 mile until you reach the park headquarters/<br/>
ranger station on the left, and take a right turn. Lake Bray<br/>
is about 1 mile down the hill, on the right.   Note on the<br/>
signs, after the kiosks, when the Reservation closes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clues:<br/>
<br/>
(Note: Trail maps are usually available at park HQ)<br/>
<br/>
You will be travelling around Lake Bray  in a counter-clockwise<br/>
direction.  <br/>
<br/>
At the parking area look for an informational map at<br/>
the beginning of a gravel path, with a brown gate behind<br/>
it. Begin walking down this path. You will shortly pass <br/>
a concrete bench on your right. At this point, note a<br/>
row of boulders on the opposite side of the path. Stand <br/>
in front of the fifth boulder, facing the lake. Look for a tree with<br/>
some exposed roots, or walk 15 paces at a bearing of 80 degrees.<br/>
Metamorphosis #1 is in the roots somewhere. This area<br/>
can get crowded, please be discreet. <br/>
<br/>
Continue along the gravel path, taking the first left onto<br/>
a trail with wooden curbs. Pass a picnic table on a deck<br/>
overlooking the lake, and then cross a small wooden bridge <br/>
over a damp area/vernal stream. Take a left onto a blue-blazed<br/>
trail. Bear left at the double blaze, following the arrow to<br/>
continue. Look on the right for a tree with 4 trunks, which is<br/>
cradling a fallen tree. Metamorphosis #2 is covered at the bottom<br/>
of this tree. <br/>
<br/>
Continue along the blue-blazed trail. A trail comes in from the right,<br/>
continue to keep left. A bridge will appear on the left, cross<br/>
it and continue going left around the lake.* The trail is blazed<br/>
yellow now. At a point where the trail bears <br/>
right and uphill (double yellow blaze), look towards the lake <br/>
for an interesting tree which is growing at an angle of 45 <br/>
degrees from the ground, and then straight up. Stand in front of this<br/>
tree and take a bearing of 185 degrees. Walk about 45 paces in this<br/>
direction. Look for a flat rock that is on the right side of the <br/>
cliff,<br/>
near the end of a log. Metamorphosis #3 is under this rock. <br/>
<br/>
You can follow the trail along the lake to the main road. Take a left <br/>
at that junction to return to the parking lot. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*At the time of this writing, the bridge over the inlet stream to<br/>
Lake Bray was in disrepair, and roped off. If this is still the case,<br/>
here are alternate directions to Metamorphosis #3. Return to the <br/>
parking<br/>
lot by retracing your steps. Walk past the building with rest rooms,<br/>
and onto the main road. Walk along the road beside the lake, and take<br/>
a right into the woods on a yellow-blazed trail (right past the point<br/>
where the wooden guardrail ends). At all junctions, keep right so that<br/>
the lake is always close. When you see the interesting tree described <br/>
above, continue with those directions.    <br/>
