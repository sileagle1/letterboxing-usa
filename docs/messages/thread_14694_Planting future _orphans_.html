&gt; Question for you experienced boxers. Is it wise to place a box in an <br/>
&gt; area that you will not be returning to? The box then becomes an <br/>
&gt; orphan. Or do you just place it and not worry whether it will be <br/>
&gt; taken care of? Purple Iris<br/>
<br/>
This is like worrying about whether it will rain on your picnic!<br/>
<br/>
If we worried about our boxes becoming orphans, we'd place very few boxes. <br/>
One of our goals is to place a box in a s many states as our little feet can <br/>
carry us! We find that most of these places are ones we would love to return to, <br/>
and often end up doing just that (i.e., Gettysburg, PA, Ashland. OR, Nantucket <br/>
MA). Whenever we read a sit rep from one of our far-away Lbs, we heave a <br/>
happy sigh wishing we were there, and sit back enjoying the fact that we brought a <br/>
little fun into some boxer's life.<br/>
<br/>
My feeling is, never let this be a reason to NOT place a box. If there's a <br/>
problem in the future, you'll figure out a way to deal with it. <br/>
