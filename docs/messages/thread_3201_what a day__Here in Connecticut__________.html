<br/>
You can't see it right now, but you will have to trust<br/>
me on this one, I have an extremely emphatic grin upon<br/>
my face as I type this message.<br/>
<br/>
After sleeping late...the girlfriends away...Eric and<br/>
myself decided to go letterboxing...."let's..."eric<br/>
started... "go find Ray's" i finished.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you unitiated with "Ray's" I am refering<br/>
to Ray's Dilema. Hidden somewhere in Connecticut..<br/>
that's all the help I am giving anyone with the desire<br/>
to find this box. It's taken me almost two years to<br/>
find this box, so if you haven't found this box you<br/>
can keep on looking. The clues to this box are either<br/>
too vague or too literal, you must choose. But gosh<br/>
dangit WE FOUND IT!!!! Mr. Hassen, you have done an<br/>
extraordinary job with this box! <br/>
<br/>
After finding this box, we decided to make a real try<br/>
to get eric over the 100f mark... Before hunger more<br/>
than darkness set in we got him to within just 6 more<br/>
boxes of this small milestone. I know with a little<br/>
more effort we will get him there!<br/>
<br/>
God, what a great day!<br/>
<br/>
Chip<br/>
