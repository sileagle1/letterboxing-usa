<br/>Planted: December 21, 2002
<br/>Town: East Hampton, CT
<br/>Length: 1 1/2 miles one way
<br/>Difficulty: Bike it or Hike it
<br/>Planted by: Music Woman
<br/>
<br/>To start in East Hampton: </b>Take Route 66 to East Hampton. Go South on Route 196 for almost half a mile. Take a left onto Flanders Road, go a quarter of a mile. Turn right on Smith Street. On your left will be a small pond with a parking area.<b>  </b>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>The Rapallo Viaduct, part of the Airline South Trail, was originally a railroad bridge built in 1873 and spanning 1,380 feet, 60 feet above <i>Flat Brook</i>. However, in 1913, the span was filled in because the bridge could no longer carry the weight of the new freight trains. 
<br/>
<br/>Go East on the Airline Trail.  At approximately 1 1/4 miles, you will come to the Rapallo Viaduct.  Just past the viaduct, you will notice a birdhouse on a tree to your left, with a 1 1/2 painted on it.  This is the 1 1/2 mile mark from East Hampton.  (if you get to some cement with curved pipes sticking out of it, you've gone too far)  From the trail in front of the birdhouse, walk on the trail that is at 290 degrees.  When you find the green water pipe, go 37 paces further to find a small piece of ledge on your left with a tree in front of it.  The Rapallo Viaduct Letterbox is hidden behind the tree, underneath the ledge, under and behind some stones.  Rehide carefully since this is right on the trail!
