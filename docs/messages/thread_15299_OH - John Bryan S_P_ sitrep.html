                    <div class="plaintext-content">CardinalMom, the kids, and I enjoyed a very nice afternoon of boxing <br/>
at John Bryan State Park today although we failed to rendevous with <br/>
Crappiefishergirl. Cellular signal was really weak down in that <br/>
canyon. Hopefully we'll catch up with her some other time - we <br/>
really hated to miss her.<br/>
<br/>
We started with the Horace Mann box. Very surreal to come upon this <br/>
great big bronze statue on a marble base out in the middle of <br/>
nowhere - weeds and brush growing up around it like a relic from some <br/>
long forgotten civilization. More surreal since someone spray <br/>
painted his boots bright red! Another massive (25'?) marble column <br/>
nearby with a brass plaque dedicated to a friend of Horace's that <br/>
nobody ever heard of adds to the atmosphere. We found the box nearby <br/>
with no trouble and discovered that all that marble makes a wonderful <br/>
place to stamp in. Very cool stamp but the logbook is about full. <br/>
We were so impressed, we left Mr. Mann a hitchhiker. We had the <br/>
impression while sitting there that the statue could go weeks or <br/>
months without anyone seeing it. Imagine our surprize 30 minutes <br/>
later when we drove by the field, to see a wedding party walking back <br/>
through the field to have a wedding there! Very surreal place!<br/>
<br/>
We then proceeded to the John Bryan Park box placed by franzsolo. <br/>
(Passed a confused looking semi-dressed up couple looking <br/>
for a wedding!) Found the box ok and sat on the log across the trail <br/>
to stamp in. Logbook pretty full and damp. CardinalMom was <br/>
returning the box when she noticed the Underground Railroad <br/>
hitchhiker box litteraly under the ground beneath the JBP box. This <br/>
thing has traveled around quite a bit. Many familiar names from the <br/>
Yahoo talk list stamped in here. We took it to move it along.<br/>
<br/>
Then we got to our main reason for coming here - to test <br/>
CardinalMom's Shavian translations of Flyfisher's frog boxes. <br/>
Started with Cliffs of Insanity and found frog #1 quickly. Her <br/>
translation was spot on! Unfortunately, #2 and #3 could not be <br/>
found. We suspect they may have washed away or become buried under a <br/>
mud slide. The translated clues looked correct - we just didn't find <br/>
the boxes.  Box we did find was wet and log nearly full.<br/>
<br/>
Then, after retreating for a wonderful, late lunch at the nearby <br/>
Clifton Mill (Ostrich burger and peach pie - mmm mmm!), we tackled <br/>
Proto Cave Frogs. Translated clues led us straight to frog #1 and <br/>
frog #2 but frog #3 seems to be missing. We suspect it was found and <br/>
vandalized - very busy area. Both box #1 and box#2 were very wet. <br/>
We couldn't even separate the pages of box #1's log so replaced it <br/>
and brought it home to dry and try to salvage. It's a shame - these <br/>
boxes all have many great stamps logged in them. Log needs replaced <br/>
in box #2 as well - it's nearly full.<br/>
<br/>
We charged on to the Genesis boxes and thanks to CardinalMom's <br/>
flawless translations found all three of these. They were all <br/>
somewhat wet and the logs are all about full.<br/>
<br/>
As the sun started down, we needed one more box to push our PFX count <br/>
to 100. We went after Vines of Time and found it right where <br/>
Flyfisher said it would be. Very cool ruin of an old stone barn. <br/>
Log is completely full in this one too - we had to squeeze another <br/>
strip in there with our stamps on it.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, in the same old barn, we ferreted out franzsolo's Resting <br/>
Spot. After all the full logbooks, we were surprized to find we were <br/>
first to stamp into this one.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, a very satisfying day. We found 11 counting the <br/>
hitchhiker, which pushed our PFX to 101 and we saw some cool things <br/>
we'd probably never have seen otherwise and we did it together as a <br/>
family on a beautiful late summer day. Doesn't get much better than <br/>
that. Just sorry we missed Crappiefishergirl.<br/>
