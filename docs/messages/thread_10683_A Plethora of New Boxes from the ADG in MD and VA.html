these clues were posted to Yahoo before they were placed on our <br/>
website.  Please change the link for these clues to the following:<br/>
<br/>
The Balls Bluff Civil War Trilogy in VA can now be found at:<br/>
http://wildwinds.tripod.com/adg2.html#bluff<br/>
<br/>
The Goose Creek Boxes in VA can now be found at:<br/>
http://wildwinds.tripod.com/adg2.html#goose<br/>
<br/>
The following clue for the Clustered Spires (a library box in MD)is <br/>
on our website but has never been posted to letterboxing.org:<br/>
http://wildwinds.tripod.com/adg2.html#spires<br/>
<br/>
We are also happy to announce that Squirrel's Devil's Racecourse box <br/>
will be back in action as of today.  Poison Ivy picked up a <br/>
replacement box from the ADG today and should be placing it as we <br/>
speak.  The directions to this box are inaccurate so we will be <br/>
posting new directions very soon.<br/>
