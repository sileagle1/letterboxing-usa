been maintained by it's owners!! (It has a new logbook and a new <br/>
stamp!!)  <br/>
<br/>
It is not on the current letterboxing website and I can not find an <br/>
email address for Craig and Jann (the owners)-- <br/>
<br/>
Here are the clues for anyone who will be in the Tampa St Petersburg <br/>
area this coming year. --<br/>

Fort De Soto County Park Letterbox<br/>
Pinellas County  <br/>
St. Petersburg, Florida.  <br/>
Placed on February 22, 2001 by Craig and Jann of Kaukauna, Wisconsin <br/>
and Jeff of St. Petersburg, Florida<br/>
<br/>
Rated:  Easy walking<br/>
<br/>
Time: 1 hour or less<br/>
<br/>
Located in the Fort De Soto County Park south of St. Petersburg, <br/>
Florida.  There are tollways to get on Pinellas Bayway and then to <br/>
go into the park.<br/>
<br/>
After entering the park, go to the south stairway of the ruins of <br/>
Fort De Soto.  Walk up the stairway, counting the number of stairs <br/>
as you go -- remember that number.<br/>
<br/>
Then go to the Arrowhead Picnic Grounds within the park, where you <br/>
will find the self-guided nature trail.<br/>
<br/>
Walk to marker number 4.  Standing in front of the marker, face due <br/>
north and walk into the woods the same number of paces (a pace <br/>
equals 24") as the number of steps on the south stairway at Fort De <br/>
Soto.<br/>
<br/>
Stop -- face due east and you see a multi-trunked live oak tree.  Go <br/>
to the trunk and you will find what you seek in a "keyhole" in the <br/>
base of the tree.  (Be wary of the poison ivy that may be abundant <br/>
in the area)<br/>
