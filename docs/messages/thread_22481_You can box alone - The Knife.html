To cut twine, to open the OFF mosquito wipes pouches (they tore right above the seal!)....and the time that I didn't carry the knife and wished that I did was when my daughter had very angry blisters on her heals and I wanted to cut the backs out of her shoes while we were on the trail.   So - we don't use the knife so much for food...just those odd-ball things!<br/>

You know, I can't help but chuckle at the knife. =) I always see it<br/>
listed as one of the "ten essentials", but in times of emergencies,<br/>
how useful can a knife really be? Something so you can kill a rabbit<br/>
for food? Fend off bears? Cut down trees for shelter? Cut off your arm<br/>
if it gets stuck under a boulder?<br/>
<br/>
There's never any indication about what the knife should be use for in<br/>
times of emergency, and I've always wondered about that. =) In case of<br/>
emergency, I can think of a lot of things I'd rather have instead of a<br/>
knife, so why does it always make the top ten?<br/>
<br/>
Even, let's assume for the sake of argument, you are lost in the woods<br/>
for several days and need to eat--wouldn't it be easier to find<br/>
berries or grass to eat than trying to take down a deer for meat? And<br/>
even if you were inclined to hunt your own food, how many "average<br/>
joes" that carry around a knife would even know how to go about doing<br/>
so? Same goes for fending off bears or cutting down trees for shelter.<br/>
I'd rather spend my effort finding a natural shelter under a tree and<br/>
keep my distance from bears. Cutting off my arm might be useful, I<br/>
suppose, in certain circumstances, though I do try to make sure I<br/>
never put myself in a situtation where that would be likely. And even<br/>
if it came down to that, I'm not even sure I'd have the guts to do it.<br/>
Maybe I could scratch my name in a rock saying, "I was here!"<br/>
<br/>
All-in-all, I never really understood the usefulness of a knife as one<br/>
of the ten essentials. *shrug* That's just me, though. =)<br/>
