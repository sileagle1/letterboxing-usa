Still no one "fessing up" to the red-tongued hitcher kidnapping <br/>
episode, although a few more hints and deflections have been cropping <br/>
up lately. We did hear yesterday from D+M, who wrote that they "would <br/>
have no reason to take [the hitchers]". Well, that may or may not be <br/>
true - most people take them just because they are THERE, and, indeed,<br/>
that is what they are there FOR - to be taken preferably nicely for a <br/>
little spin!  D+M had also told us on several previous occasions that <br/>
going back to known letterbox sites was how they had frequently found <br/>
hitchers in the past!<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, had it not been for last month's uncanny confluence of <br/>
hitcher count and complaint that threw me off track, D+M would <br/>
definitely have been our prime suspects in this recent mystery case<br/>
(or "kidnapping caper", as D+M referred to it yesterday!) They had, <br/>
in fact, pulled a similar stunt on Aug.31st of last year at the 40<br/>
Swans mystery in SE CT - right down to the very same type of stuck-<br/>
out-tongue-faced drawings that now appear on the red-faced stamps!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, D+M had long been aware (as had others) of how poorly I <br/>
relate to the need some people seem to have of proclaiming their <br/>
firstness at letterbox sites (as if that were the main point of the <br/>
hobby!)  After all, I would think that who got there first should be <br/>
quite obvious from the date and page in the logbook, and that the <br/>
focus on proclaiming firstness would seem to be only marginally <br/>
appropriate for children or excited newcomers!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, at 40 Swans, D+M decided to do a particularly flamboyant <br/>
spoof on some of the more obnoxious features of this "HAHAHA" -<br/>
"we're first" behavior, then sent me an e-mail message to go see, <br/>
get a good laugh, and then pull them out! After I went and made <br/>
copies, I wrote back to them that the caricatures were "hilarious"<br/>
but that I would leave them for others to see and "have a good laugh" <br/>
at as well, unstated being that the examples themselves should serve <br/>
as just that kind of nasty juvenile behavior to be avoided!<br/>
<br/>
Well,it certainly would never have occurred to me back then that D+M <br/>
might ever stoop to a repeat of such behavior or that those past <br/>
actions of theirs might actually spawn "copy cats"! That is what we <br/>
thought happened on Feb.15th. Now we just don't know WHAT to think of <br/>
people anymore. I guess this is why it is so important for all of us <br/>
to try to set GOOD examples and overlook the BAD ones!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry once again for having to expose this last bit of nastiness, but <br/>
with no other apology or explanation forthcoming, I felt that these <br/>
things really should come out and hopefully put an end to this story!<br/>

Just have to put 2 cents in. I am not real sure if this subject is a <br/>
spoof, so won't go there, but must say as a 'new letterboxer'  , I have <br/>
begun to feel sorry for the regular first's we keep seeing. My feelings <br/>
are ,"how sad, that they miss all the lovely stamps and messages that <br/>
always follow them."  I love readiing thoughts people leave and enjoy <br/>
the stamps. No way would I like to be 'first'<br/>

Hi Butterfly,<br/>
<br/>
We are definitely with you on this one;  we don't like being first<br/>
either and often go back to a box just to read people's entries.  The<br/>
only reason we felt that we had to get to boxes first for awhile was<br/>
to try to set a good example about writing pleasant messages rather<br/>
than proclamations about being first or about beating so-and-so.  We<br/>
have never once written about being first and we are very pleased that<br/>
many others are also following that example.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I guess I missed most of this one. From what I can get out of this is <br/>
there a big thing about being first to a box. It's nice once in a <br/>
while but who cares? Does it matter if you are the 50th? As for <br/>
kidnapping hitchhikers I guess I don't understand what that is all <br/>
about at all. If some one gets a hitchhiker and puts it back into <br/>
circulation good. If they look into boxes they already visited and <br/>
had already stamped, so what? No big deal. The sticking out the <br/>
tongue stamp, thats just and childish. In the immortal words of <br/>
Rodney King "Can't we all just get along?"<br/>
