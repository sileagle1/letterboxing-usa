Northwest aka: Letterbox Heaven. (grin)<br/>
<br/>
I just love the PNW ... breathtakinginly beautiful! friendly,<br/>
kindhearted people and amazing letterboxes!<br/>
<br/>
I left three boxes to be planted, launched a hitch hiker, brought <br/>
back a box from Maiden1974 to plant in MI and gave a hitch hiker a <br/>
big boost (he'll go in a box here in MI)<br/>
<br/>
Came down with the flu the day after I returned from PNW so haven't <br/>
worked on the virtuals much but I do intend to finish the series.<br/>
<br/>
Bindle Bum and I are leaving for 2 weeks in FL today. Take heart, <br/>
those who view Ft Meyers as a "dismal" boxing area.  I am taking <br/>
along 4 boxes which I hope to plant in the Ft Meyers area. <br/>
<br/>
As we'll be aboard a sailboat most of the time, I'm going "no mail" <br/>
for the lists and probably won't be checking my mail until we return.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>
