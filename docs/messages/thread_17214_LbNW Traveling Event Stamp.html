We haven't seen the stamp in over a year, when it was at one of the <br/>
RI Mystery Gatherings, but it's funny you mention it this morning. <br/>
Last night an artist friend of ours was looking through an old <br/>
logbook and picked that stamp as her favorite. She loved the line <br/>
and porportion, the simplicity and the hint of abstraction. I'm sure <br/>
it's in good hands somewhere.<br/>

&gt; Anybody know where my LbNW Traveling Event Stamp might be?  Someone<br/>
thought<br/>
&gt; that perhaps Steve of Team Rayvenhaus might have it from his event in<br/>
October .<br/>
&gt; . .   What about it, Steve?  Anyone know?  It should would be nice to see<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; again.  I was hoping it would show up for the event we had in Hillsboro,<br/>
&gt; Oregon last weekend, but no luck.<br/>
