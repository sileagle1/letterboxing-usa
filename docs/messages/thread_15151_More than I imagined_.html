                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went out with the complete brood today.  Tackled a fairly easy trail at a<br/>
local park in search of Happy Dogs.  Found all three of Scout Dog's boxes<br/>
and a bonus box by Franzsolo to boot!  And in the bonus box was another<br/>
bonus entitled Mooney's Third Hitch Hiker!  Wow!  I had been working on the<br/>
kids about discretion and think I blew it all when I was sitting on the log<br/>
shouting "It s a hitch hiker!  I found a hitch hiker!"  Anyhow, Mooney's<br/>
third will journey out to the Windy City sometime next month. I figure a HH<br/>
shoudl be well traveled. after all.<br/>
<br/>
The kids loved stamping in--the older two have  their own (commercial)<br/>
stamps and a log book now.  My 6yo actually labelled each of her stamps<br/>
herself, so I can now add journal writing to  the benefits of boxing.  The<br/>
15mo walked a good half mile before melting down and daddy took her back to<br/>
the car--it was pretty hot and muggy, so I felt a bit like crying a few<br/>
times as well, but those boxes jsut kept me motivated.  We all got over some<br/>
of our aversion to dirt and to bugs.  The kids are now fighting over who<br/>
gets to retreive the box (after Mama makes sure their are no critters and<br/>
crawleis) and who gets to hide it.  They are getting the idea of  "secret<br/>
treasure hunt" tho the 4yo announces loudly when someone is coming.<br/>
<br/>
In additon to the stamps, we saw some horses on an adjoining trail, lots of<br/>
cool bugs, frogs dragonflies, butterflies, nifty caterpillars hanging from<br/>
trees and a mondo wasp's nest--bigger than a basket ball!  Looked to be<br/>
defunct, but I sure didn't poke at it to see.<br/>
<br/>
My hubby lectured on fallen trees (I ws busy stamping so only heard the<br/>
drone, lol) and we all learned that my 6yo is better with the compass than I<br/>
am.  After a commemorative picture at the start/end of the trail, we headed<br/>
home hot, dirty, tired, and happy.<br/>
<br/>
How can anything that involves so much dirt, bugs, and sweat be so much darn<br/>
fun?<br/>
