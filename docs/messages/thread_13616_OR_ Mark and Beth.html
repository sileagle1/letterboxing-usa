I just discovered that after nearly two years of waiting, they are the<br/>

They last posted to the list back in February after finding my <br/>
Musician boxes. I think I may have successfully emailed them then <br/>

you try the latest? - I think it is a hotmail address instead of the <br/>
verizon address they used to have.<br/>

In any case ditto on hearing from them again!<br/>
