The Second Highest Point in Bucks County<br/>

After parking in the small lot on the left locate the large tree at the<br/>
V of two trails.  Take the trail at 228*.  I must warn you to follow<br/>
the worn trail as it winds its way up the mountain and over boulders as<br/>
best as you can.  The trail you are to follow has red wooden blocks<br/>
attached to trees and white or red painted markings.  Caution:  some are<br/>
faded.  On occasion you will see blue or yellow markings. Just disregard<br/>
them.  As you begin your assent over the boulders to the top you should<br/>
spy a red wooden block with a dripping yellow dot.  You are on the right<br/>
track if you see a large balancing boulder above it.  Keep this<br/>
formation in mind when searching for the box.  Upon reaching the top you<br/>
should see a large table rock (great resting spot) with a tree butted up<br/>
against it.  Take a Northerly course towards the balancing rock.  Look<br/>
for two painted arrows pointing left with a red dot between them.  &lt;---<br/>
*  &lt;---  Standing under the dot take a bearing of 222* and take 8 steps<br/>
in that direction.  Take a seat facing the arrows &amp; dot reaching down<br/>
with your right hand.  A cover rock is placed on top of box.  After<br/>
stamping up return to the base of the table rock and look for the white<br/>
blaze on a skinny tree.  Carefully find your way back down over the<br/>
rocks to the worn trail and back to the parking area.<br/>
The best time to hunt this box is during the winter months to be<br/>
afforded a better view while the trees are devoid of leaves.  It would<br/>
be also be wise to go on Sunday when the hunters are at rest.<br/>
