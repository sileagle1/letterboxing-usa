<br/>
<br/></b>FACT ABOUT BOXERS AND BRIDGES
<br/>
<br/>haf and khadi baakrime really enjoy boxing. on vacations we frequently photograph bridges because they are so beautiful, hence the name Boxers and Bridges. we plan to bury a picture of a different boxer near various bridges along our travels, and look forward to corresponding with other Letterboxers. 
<br/>
<br/>We have just planted our first Letterbox.  Look below for the clues.
<br/>
<br/>1.  It is buried on Tangier Island, Va.  To get to Tangier Island, you will have to take a boat.  (tour boats or the Crisfield, Md mail boat are available at $10.00 per person.  
<br/>
<br/>2.  Upon arriving to Tangier Island, obtain a tour map in one of the tour map boxes which are available all over the island.  ($.50)
<br/>
<br/>3.  Locate  # 23 on the map ( "to beach")
<br/>4.  Cross the wooden bridge and at the bottom immediately count off 41 paces along the trail.
<br/>
<br/>5.  Our letterbox is located at 205 degrees SW.

<div>Greetings Haf and Khadi and welcome to the world of 
Letterboxing!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sounds like you have a nice theme for 
letterboxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You'll want to be hiding, not burying, your 
letterboxes.  None of the letterboxers I know carry shovels :-)  In 
general, burying boxes is considered bad form.  Also, in our current 
climate, taking photos of bridges and/or burying anything near bridges may get 
you into some interesting situations with the authorities.  Be discrete in 
these activities.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope to see that you've hidden a box in my area 
some day - Spokane has some wonderful bridges!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Best regards,</div>

<br/>hi hanglider,
<br/>
<br/>i appreciate your tidbits about letterboxing.  i would think that it would be equally bad form to have hundreds of people leaving plastic letterboxs that could be dislodged and then left to clutter up the countryside as well.  so i guess that there are pros and cons.  there isn't anyplace to actually hide a letter box on tangiers island as it is a very  marshy area with no trees--it being a remote fishing village.  secondly, almost every square inch of the island is privately owned..thus our box is buried just under the sand near a small foot bridge.  i am assuming that you thought we buried our box near a big monstrosity of a bridge.  no no no....just a little foot bridge.  we buried our box with a very small wooden spoon....so anyone who can yield a twig can get to it...as it is only under sand...and no terrain would be disrupted at all.
<br/>as for taking photos of bridges, as vacationers...we are not alone in our appreciation of beautiful bridges and the photographing of them.  these photos are for our own personal use in our scrapbooks.  we do not include them in our letter boxes.   as an american citizen by birth..if i cannot take a photo of a brige in my own country...its time for me to move out!!!!
<br/>
<br/>best wishes and good luck with your letterboxing adventures

<div>Greetings again!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll leave it to those with more experience than I 
to comment on the burying of boxes.  Sounds to me like your box wouldn't be 
disruptive - but I'm new to all this to.  My guess is that a precendent 
might be set that could get out of hand.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As for taking photos of bridges - I do believe 
there is an old law about this that has been recently dredged up.  For 
instance - suppose you or I tried taking a photo of any of the bridges 
leading into New York city.  I'm not sure they'd arrest us, but they'd 
probably ask us lots of questions if they caught us doing it.  I was just 
trying to warn you to be discrete when you photograph, so you don't get into 
trouble.  But that's off-topic for this forum.  Let us know when 
you've placed your next box!</div>
<div> </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In certain instances I can see where one might have to<br/>
somewhat bury a box- the situation you state *might*<br/>
be one of them, but I'm not familiar with the area<br/>
enough to say.  However, please don't read more into<br/>
the comments than is necessary-I don't believe them to<br/>
be inflamatory, rather to be light banter with a<br/>
gentle message for ALL letterboxers, newbies and<br/>
veterans, included. :o)<br/>
<br/>
We have many, mostly in the National Park system and<br/>
Audobon Societies, who think of letterboxing<br/>
negatively because they believe it involves people<br/>
with shovels digging holes in sensitive habitat. It<br/>
*may* be the case with our cousin hobby, geocaching,<br/>
and that may be where they get their misinformation<br/>
from.<br/>
<br/>
 We letterboxers, as a group, want to stay away from<br/>
that image and stick to Leave No Trace rules as much<br/>
as possible.  This requires us to be particularily<br/>
sensitive to the habitat when finding places to put<br/>
boxes.  If an area proves to be too difficult to place<br/>
because of the habitat and we have to start digging,<br/>
then that would be, in my opinion, a place we<br/>
shouldn't be placing boxes.  Your point about<br/>
littering with rubbermaid is well taken, too.  Yes,<br/>
pros and cons.<br/>
<br/>
This is just my opinion, of course, but we need to<br/>
remember that, as much fun as it is for us to go out<br/>
and search for a box, this is the home for many<br/>
creatures.  This is thier world, we are the intruders<br/>
and we need to be mindful of that fact. <br/>
<br/>
For instance,I have come upon one area where a box was<br/>
supposed to be tucked under a fallen log.  Whoever<br/>
arrived before us had completely raked over the area<br/>
without bothering to try to be gentle in looking nor<br/>
trying to replace any of the leaf litter/groundcover<br/>
they removed in their search.  Not only did this make<br/>
this area an eyesore, but it also ruined a piece of<br/>
the habitat for those who dwelled there.  Not a pretty<br/>
site (and the box had been long missing anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Another point that I have been mulling over recently<br/>
is in thinking of how the area we plant in is intended<br/>
to be used.  Many times we hear of letterboxers going<br/>
out to look for boxes and mentioning that they found<br/>
"No Trespassing" or "Private Property" signs. I don't<br/>
know why anyone would knowingly plant on private<br/>
property that wasn't their own.   Just something else<br/>
to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing, I hope you find it as<br/>
enjoyable as photographing bridges.<br/>

<br/>
Just a funny little slug-and-letterboxing note, which has very little to <br/>
do with anything at all:  When I went out to find the Lincoln Park Slug <br/>
Box in West Seattle....I got there and there was actually A SLUG on the <br/>
top of the box.  One of those big black monstrosities that we get here <br/>
in the northwest. :)<br/>
<br/>
It's the only time I've had to battle nature for the box. :) :)<br/>
<br/>
(And what a battle it was!  Man vs. Slug in a battle for a stamp....)<br/>
