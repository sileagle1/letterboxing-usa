                    <div class="plaintext-content">On June 16, 2002 Funhog placed the Shining Star Letterbox near Idaho Springs, Clear Creek County, <br/>
Colorado. In the clear, thin Rocky Mountain air the night sky is a riot of stars but this little star shines <br/>
brighter than all the rest. This trek is about three miles roundtrip along the well maintained Chicago <br/>
Lakes Trail. In the charming Gold Rush town of Idaho Springs you can dine on buffalo or soak in an <br/>
underground hot spring.<br/>
<br/>
To the trailhead: From Denver head west on I-70 to Exit 240. From here head south fourteen miles on <br/>
Route 103, the Mount Evans Highway. Just before the fee station you will find the Chicago Lakes <br/>
Trailhead on the right side of the road. Parking is on the left.<br/>
<br/>
To the letterbox: When the Chicago Lakes Trail meets up with the Echo Lake Trail, it goes left and left <br/>
again at the next signed junction. From the far end of the log bridge that crosses the creek walk twenty <br/>
steps more to a rock on the left side of the trail. Turn left here and walk fifty steps to where the <br/>
letterbox awaits beneath silver wood and golden stone<br/>
