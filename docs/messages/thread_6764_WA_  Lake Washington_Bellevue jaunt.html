(Seattle, WA area) and found several neat little boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Heart of Lake Washington:  What a neat little park on beautiful <br/>
Mercer Island!  Drum Roll...I can't believe that we were the first <br/>
ones to visit this box.  That was exciting!!!  This, most likely, <br/>
will be a first and a last for us being first so we won't really be <br/>
able to say this again!!! It was sticking out a bit from its hiding <br/>
place so we ensured it was not visible at all when we were finished <br/>
with it.  We'll definitely be back to Mercer Island in the future.  <br/>
Also have a couple ideas for other neat little hiding spots on the <br/>
island.<br/>
<br/>
Kelsey Creek Park boxes:  What an absolute treasure so close to the <br/>
big city.  I had been in the area MANY, MANY times before and never <br/>
even knew a park existed there!  Thanks for the nice detour!  Box #2 <br/>
was totally visible to the world--I can't believe it was still there <br/>
as there have been daycamps there at the park for weeks--2 groups of <br/>
kids passed us on the trail during our hunt.  We ensured that it was <br/>
well hidden after the fact--I've started to hide the letterboxes <br/>
with 'bright colored' lids upside down so the clear part of the <br/>
boxes may be less likely to attract attention in the event <br/>
their 'cover &amp; concealment' is removed.  Boxes #1 and #3 were in <br/>
good shape.  We really liked all of the stamps and the different <br/>
colors of ink you provided in the boxes.  YOU SHOULD PAT YOURSELVES <br/>
ON THE BACKS FOR A JOB WELL DONE!!!  The clues to #3 are a bit <br/>
confusing, though, (we noticed other letterboxers in the log had <br/>
similar problems &amp; that there were several who had found #1 &amp; #2 who <br/>
never found #3)--perhaps adding a line in the clues about not <br/>
counting the boardwalks until after you pass the <br/>
boardwalk/stair/boardwalk structure after the 'Y' might help reduce <br/>
the confusion?  <br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks so much for a neat little relaxing detour in our <br/>
hectic lives.  We really enjoyed our visit today and look forward to <br/>
seeking out more of your adventures in the future!!!<br/>
