                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Boxes planted November 22,2001 by Tom and Audrey Edwards in the Florida <br/>
Keys, Monroe County, Florida.   <br/>
 Well, I hope this works! It seemed like a good idea at the time. Let me know <br/>
how it goes.<br/>
    We've placed four stamps down if the Florida Keys. You will need to <br/>
locate all four, and place them correctly to get the final "stamp." On the <br/>
back of each stamp is a diagram showing where it goes in the quadrant. The <br/>
diagram shows where it goes "as it is being stamped".There are two in the <br/>
Upper Keys and two in the Lower Keys.<br/>
 I recommend starting with the Key West stamp as that is the only box that <br/>
has a composite picture of the final product. The other three only have the <br/>
stamp and the log. You could take the more challenging route by starting in <br/>
Key Largo and "surprise" yourself with the last stamp in the Key West <br/>
location. You're going to be driving passed the Key Largo box anyway on your <br/>
way south, but you'll be coming back that way again as you are leaving.<br/>
 It took us two long days to locate and plant the boxes, but I suppose they <br/>
could be located and completed in one day, but why not make it a long weekend <br/>
and enjoy the Keys?<br/>
 I decided to keep the directions straightforward rather than cryptic. You're <br/>
going to have enough to do, as it is.<br/>
 There are a couple of criteria you will need to know about to pull this off <br/>
successfully.<br/>
 1st- I used an eraser that measures about 1-1/2"x3" for my stamps. Since you <br/>
will be using four stamps, you will need to have paper that is at least <br/>
3"x6".Bring extra paper!! Through trial and error we discovered that every <br/>
application of ink to the stamp is not consistent. Normally, this never <br/>
seemed to matter in our searches. For this to be successful you will need to <br/>
get good (consistent) at this. I have reiterated this in each of the boxes. <br/>
Bring your own pad AND extra ink. After applying ink to the stamp hold it up <br/>
to the light to reflect off of the surface to insure that it is evenly "wet" <br/>
with ink. Make a test stamp or two on that extra paper to get a good image <br/>
before stamping your "final" piece.<br/>
 Believe me here - after traveling the length of the Keys for two days and <br/>
getting three good stamps and then finding that the fourth was a little light <br/>
on ink will be terribly deflating. I've NEVER been able to redo a stamp on <br/>
top of itself. Probably a good idea to attempt two or more "final pieces" to <br/>
insure at least one good "keeper."<br/>
 2nd - The stamps are "numbered" 1 thru 4, but that only refers to their <br/>
position in the quadrant and not their placing along the islands. I did place <br/>
them so that no two stamps will get applied diagonally, but rather will abut <br/>
each other to help keep the final piece as "square" as possible.<br/>
 3rd - Please take time and read the "Leave No Trace Principles" posted on <br/>
the Letterboxing website. I carry a copy of this in my letterboxing backpack. <br/>
Remember to be sneaky.<br/>
 Good luck! E-mail me when you get a chance and let me know how it came out.<br/>
 I'm at SLOOPYTOM@AOL.COM<br/>
 Stamp #2 is located at Fort Zachery Taylor State Park. Get a street map of <br/>
Key West (they're everywhere) and locate the park at the southern(western) <br/>
end of the island. You enter the park through the entrance to the Truman <br/>
Annex off of Southard Street. Although there are guard shacks, it's <br/>
unrestricted. Follow signs into the Park and park in the Beach Parking area. <br/>
Lots to see and do here. A great beach and the Fort itself. At the end of the <br/>
parking lot walk straight out towards the ocean and you will see a huge piece <br/>
of driftwood (drift tree) on the shore. Check out the boat traffic. At the <br/>
tree turn right and follow a bike/walk path a little ways to where it makes a <br/>
jog to the right. There are large granite blocks that on your right that are <br/>
bordering the path that continue on straight after the jog in the path. <br/>
Follow these blocks. You'll see that most of them are rectangular but that <br/>
two of them are more like jagged rocks. At the base of the 2nd "rock" I <br/>
hauled up a couple of smaller rocks and put them at the base to hide the box <br/>
you're looking for. This "rock" is about the 12th block after the jog in the <br/>
path.<br/>
 This is a good distance from the Fort, but you are still out in a wide open <br/>
area so remember all of the precautions we need to take as successful <br/>
letterboxers - be sneaky. <br/>
 After getting your stamp and replacing the box, step back 5' or 10' and see <br/>
if it looks undisturbed and natural. Make corrections as necessary.<br/>
 Stamp #4 - is located in the Jack C. Watson Wildlife Trail on Big Pine Key.<br/>
 After getting to Big Pine Key turn onto Key Deer Blvd. On Monday - Friday <br/>
make a right into the shopping center and go to the National Wildlife Refuge <br/>
office and get information on the Trail. Otherwise, or on Saturday or Sunday <br/>
just continue on up Key Deer Blvd. about 2-3 miles and watch for a small <br/>
parking area on the right for the Blue Hole. This is not where you are <br/>
headed, but it's a nice short stop,nonetheless.Keep your eyes peeled for the <br/>
famous Key Deer. About 1/3 mile passed there, watch for a small Wildlife <br/>
Trail sign, on the right also, and pull in and park. The trail is a 2/3 mile <br/>
loop and the box is under and behind a great looking buttonwood tree that has <br/>
a sign.<br/>
 Stamp #1 - is located in the Upper Keys at the Wildbird Care Center on Key <br/>
Largo at mile marker 93.6. This is on the Gulf side of the road. Take the <br/>
boardwalk to the end. There is a nice blind set up at the end of the walk <br/>
when you go to the left, but you have to go to the right to find the box. Go <br/>
to the end of the walk and continue on the road. It'll veer to the right and <br/>
then splits into two roads. Right in the "V" formed by the road is a <br/>
multi-trunked buttonwood tree (like the one on Big Pine).I moved a couple of <br/>
limestone rocks over to the base of the tree at the rear. You'll find the box <br/>
under them. Although this is a ways from the center, you are kind of out in <br/>
the open here, so watch out for other people coming and going along the roads <br/>
while you are removing and replacing the box.<br/>
 Stamp #3 - is at the John Pennecamp Coral Reef Park also on Key Largo at <br/>
mile marker 103. Admission here is $5.00 for two people. Get a map and locate <br/>
the Tamarind Trail. Take the trail and the White Stopper tree sign. This one <br/>
is also kind of out in the open so watch out for other people. The box is in <br/>
a large hollow coral rock (about 2'x3') just to the left of the sign, about <br/>
2' away. I plugged the opening with another rock that "fits" pretty good and <br/>
then placed another rock outside of that one. Remove the rocks but remember <br/>
exactly how they came out because it only fits one way into the opening. <br/>
After replacing, stand back and see if the box is visible. If it is still <br/>
visible, reposition the box and/or the rock to block any prying eyes.<br/>
 Well, that should do it.<br/>
