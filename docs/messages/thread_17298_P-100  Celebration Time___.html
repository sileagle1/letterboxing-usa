Haivng found a couple of your boxes, I would like to thank you for spreading<br/>
the fun.  I can tell you that the UNion Station in Cinci and  Steeple Chase<br/>
in Lexington were alive and well  within the last few months (At least, I<br/>
think those were yours. and am too lazy to check right now, lol)<br/>
<br/>
Keep planting!<br/>
