<br/>
First of all, I'd like to thank everyone for the nice comments you've <br/>
given me, in both the talk list and in personal emails. It's great to <br/>
see that people are enjoying our letterboxes and stamps, and <br/>
our website as well. And, it's nice to make new friends through <br/>
such an entertaining hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of friends, my friend Sonya (hi Sonya!) and I were out <br/>
finding the Crabbing Bridge letterbox at Cheesequake State Park <br/>
in New Jersey on Sunday. We noticed in the stamp book that <br/>
other letterboxers had been there earlier that same day. A close <br/>
call! Too bad we didn't bump into you--it would've been nice to <br/>
meet some fellow letterboxers in person.<br/>
<br/>
I've had the clues to boxes #4-6 on our website <br/>
http://members.aol.com/pcletterboxing/find.htm , but I was <br/>
waiting until they were "road-tested" before I "officially" posted <br/>
them to the talk list. But, since people have now found each of <br/>
them, I'll be posting them in a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Some other comments:<br/>
<br/>
1) Noelle: Glad to hear you're enjoying our boxes! The stamp for <br/>
"A 'Mooving' Tale" is my favorite (so far). Good luck with the <br/>
others!<br/>
<br/>
2) SpaceTraveler: If you look at the photos page <br/>
http://members.aol.com/pcletterboxing/photo.htm on our <br/>
website, you'll see that the first two photos were from Ringing <br/>
Rocks Park. Try to ignore the goofy people in the foreground. <br/>
And, we'll try to write some more "road rally" clues for you.<br/>
<br/>
3) Todd &amp; Pam: You're right about the influx of new NJ <br/>
letterboxers. Good for NJ! Oh, by the way, your "Deepest NJ <br/>
Number 1" clue is driving me insane. Let me repeat: INSANE. <br/>
But, I promise you, I'll figure it out one day (most likely, in the<br/>
year <br/>
2012).<br/>
<br/>
4) Jay in CT: Thanks for the complements! I'm hoping I can get <br/>
more clues to "sprout up" relatively soon.<br/>
<br/>
5) See Joy &amp; Lockmaster: Glad you liked "Fisherman's Point" <br/>
and "Into the Woods." The "Fisherman's Point" box had to be <br/>
moved, because on the day of our first Guild meeting, some <br/>
actual fisherman found the box and were looking through it! We <br/>
should have renamed the box, "Fisherman Point Out Where the <br/>
Box Is, So You Don't Have to Bother Finding It Yourselves." We <br/>
wen't back a few days later and tried to hide it a bit deeper in the <br/>
woods. I hope it seemed out of the way enough. That was the <br/>
first box we planted, so we didn't really know what we were <br/>
doing!<br/>
<br/>
6) Jay C (The Jolly G-Man): Thanks for the complements!<br/>
<br/>
Boy, I've rambled on enough, and it's 4:00am. Have fun, <br/>
everyone. More clues (and more difficult, hopefully) are on the <br/>
way!<br/>
