                    <div class="plaintext-content">After spending a small fortune in replacing the <br/>
Crystal Dye stamp pads for the very same reason:<br/>
a dry pad fresh out of the wrapper!  Grrrrrrr.  <br/>
I found a place that sells the Colorbox stamp <br/>
pads and reinkers.  For every color pad I bought <br/>
I also got a little bottle of the reinker.  Now <br/>
when the pad goes dry I can recharge it for a <br/>
lot less than replacing the whole pad.  The colors<br/>
looked good on my monitor too. The only problem was <br/>
holding back and not ordering them all!  :-) <br/>
Shipping was $3.95 and I was able to pay by PayPal.<br/>
Here's the link: http://www.stampandgo.com<br/>
<br/>
I also use the "Perfect Ink Refresher" on dry pads, <br/>
but I'm not that crazy about it.  This I found in <br/>
A.C.Moore and is costs about $5.00.  Spritzing with <br/>
water will do the same thing....but with the water <br/>
I wonder if the ink would run.<br/>

I buy them at Michael's, usually the Sunday paper has a 40% off <br/>
coupon for 1 item, so they work out pretty cheap. I've lately been <br/>
collecting "Dauber Duos" by Tsukineko, they are small circles and <br/>
double ended-every color imaginable. However, for a very finely <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I prefer Nick Bantock dye ink pads made by Ranger over all others. <br/>
They cost around $5 but are well worth it. Some specialty stamping <br/>
stores carry them or you can buy them on-line. Reinkers are available <br/>
as well.I've used the same one with my LBing signature/business stamp <br/>
for over a year, stamped hundreds of times and it is still as vibrant <br/>
as when it was new. I've not reinked it yet. There is a fair range of <br/>
colors.<br/>
<br/>
Ancient Page dye ink stamp pads are archival and very good too and <br/>
come in many colors. There are other archival pads that are equally <br/>
as good. These claim to be permanent and waterproof and a little more <br/>
expensive. I recently needed an archival ink pad in a hurry so bought <br/>
the brand that Michael's carries and again, it was dry so I returned <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
The $1 Ink-it-up dye ink pads from A.C. Moore are not half-bad. I've <br/>
put them out in letterboxes and unless some dismal fate befalls them, <br/>
they seem to hold up quite well. <br/>
<br/>
All Colorbox pads are pigment based so take much longer to dry and <br/>
can be a messy choice for placing in a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
I've had similar experiences with Crystal pads from Michael's and <br/>
have returned every one I've ever purchased there. <br/>

So since I've never used markers on a stamp before, what type of markers do you <br/>
recommend and is there any trick to using them?  I assume you just "paint" the stamp with <br/>
the marker...<br/>

One of my favorites which I haven't seen mentioned yet is the Marvy <br/>
Matchables line of dye-based pads.  They come in 40 colors which <br/>
match the marker colors.  They're small (2"x2" or so) but the ink pad <br/>
is raised so it works with any size stamp.  They're also stackable if <br/>
you tend to collect a lot of colors (who, me?).<br/>

colors)" on the top right.<br/>

I just bought one of these yesterday, and I'm not crazy about it.   The ink <br/>
beads on the stamp. so I get a very "spotty" image.<br/>

&gt; All Colorbox pads are pigment based so take much longer to dry and <br/>
&gt; can be a messy choice for placing in a letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
uhm... no they're not. Colorbox makes more than one type of stamp <br/>
pad and not all of them are pigment based.<br/>
<br/>
My current particular favorite stamp pads are the Colorbox CHALK <br/>
ones. They are DYE based, not pigment so they dry fast. The colors <br/>
are fantastic, every single one of the pads are juicy not dry at all <br/>
plus they come in both the standard size and those wonderful small <br/>
cats eye size that are so good for when your out hiking.<br/>
<br/>
actually, we use all kinds of stamp pads and markers cuz I'm into <br/>
rubber stamp art and scrapbooking so I already have lots of them <br/>
around. Repeat after me: re-inkers are your friend! lol<br/>
<br/>
if you don't have a re-inker and your stamp pad is dry you can bring <br/>
it back to life by using a 50-50 mix of water and glycerine that you <br/>
apply like you would a re-inker. glycerine is cheap at the pharmacy! <br/>
This will turn your dye pad into something halfway like a pigment <br/>
pad though so it may take a little longer to dry when you do stamp <br/>
it so dont close your logbook right away or you might get smearing.<br/>
<br/>
As for the markers I use, I like the Marvy brand brush markers. They <br/>
stay wet longer than most others, they last forever and come in <br/>
packs that you can use the 40% off coupon for at Michaels. <br/>
<br/>
Using markers: stamp a trial image on the stamp so you know what it <br/>
looks like then color directly on the stamp putting the colors you <br/>
want in the areas you want, then hold the stamp near your mouth and <br/>
HUFF on it to use your warm breath to moisten the dye based marker <br/>
colors, like you'd do to clean your sunglasses, then stamp the image <br/>
in your logbook. Sometimes you can get more than one image before <br/>
having to re-color the stamp with markers.<br/>

But sometimes it works out to be much more noticeable with inks if you go the <br/>
embossing route, using a heat gun.  I make all of our cards, and I frequently <br/>
use embossing when I make holiday cards using the more pastel inks that don't <br/>
stand out very well on their own.   <br/>
<br/>
I'm doing lavender on pink for Easter cards, and at first the only things <br/>
noticeable were my paper glazed chocolate Easter bunnies.  But the lavender on <br/>
pink worked nicely with embossing.<br/>

Your Cat's Eye pad with an extra fine silver embossing powder would probably give you what you need.  I would recommend the extra fine powder because it is the best for fine detail.

Oohhh, Maiden.  Silver stamp on lavender speckled paper?  Suhweet!<br/>
<br/>
I really like the silver pigment ink in my Versa Color pad. They make <br/>
a small pad (1" X 1") and it shows up well even on light paper.  They <br/>
stamp pretty thickly so you might want to get a few if you're <br/>
printing a lot of announcements.<br/>
<br/>
And congratulations,<br/>
