                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am assuming you are asking about letterboxing.org.  If you go to the main page, click on "Search for Boxes" under the main picture (it's in the second row and on the far right as it shows up on my computer).  Then scroll through the list of placers and you can see all those who have boxes listed on LbNA.  Other than that, just try signing up for the name, and it'll tell you if it's already taken.<br/>
<br/>
  On atlasquest.com, you can go to "People" on the top bar, and click on "Letterboxer Directory" from the drop-down list.  Just browse by the name alphabetically, and you can see if somebody is registered under that name.  Once again, if it's already taken, they'll tell you.<br/>
<br/>
  Good luck,<br/>

  I just checked the Members listing on LBNA, and did not find a santafreya.  Let us know if you need other help.  Oh, and WELCOME!   MayEve<br/>
