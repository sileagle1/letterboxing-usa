<br/>
If "floater sue" is out there, just wanted to let you know that we <br/>
found your letterbox at Koko Crater Botanical Gardens in Oahu!  What <br/>
a rush it was to actually find the box!  We were so excited!  It was <br/>
our first letterbox hunt.  We were screaming when we found the box!  <br/>
Your box is in excellent condition!  Several people from all over <br/>
the country have signed in. We are planning to go back to get your <br/>
snail mail addy.  In our excitement, we forgot to write it down and <br/>
we have pictures we want to send you!<br/>
<br/>
Aloha,<br/>
Stacey<br/>
