<br/>
Groh Park<br/>
Amelia, Ohio (Clermont County)<br/>
Date placed October 12, 2002<br/>
 - by ameliapezgirl &amp; Ben<br/>
difficulty: easy<br/>
Please bring a pen and stamppad.<br/>
<br/>
 Driving directions:   Take State Route 125 (Ohio Pike) into the village of Amelia.   Turn Right at the light onto Huntsman Tr.   This road takes you into the Quail Creek neighborhood.   Go about 1/10th of a mile, Groh park is on the left. <br/>
<br/>
The mission if you choose to accept it:<br/>
 After parking in the parking lot at Groh park, locate the picnic shelter.   See that garbage can?   Go to it and take a reading of 90 degrees.   Go forward 14 paces along the paved trail.   STOP.....now proceed on the trail less traveled.   Continue until you reach a small footbridge.   After crossing the footbridge, take a reading of 345 degrees.   What you are seeking is ahead 4 paces.   Look carefully because what you are hunting for is camoflauged.   Stamp in.   Please replace as found.   Would love to hear from you if your hunt was successful (or even if it wasn't) ameliapezgirl@aol.com<br/>

Groh Park<br/>
Amelia, Ohio (Clermont County)<br/>
Date placed October 12, 2002<br/>
 - by ameliapezgirl &amp; Ben (Ben, my 10 yr old son, made and placed this box)<br/>
difficulty: easy<br/>
Please bring a pen, stamppad and a compass might be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
 Driving directions:   Take State Route 125 (Ohio Pike) into the village of <br/>
Amelia.   Turn Right at the light onto Huntsman Tr.   This road takes you <br/>
into the Quail Creek neighborhood.   Go about 1/10th of a mile, Groh park is <br/>
on the left. <br/>
<br/>
The mission if you choose to accept it:<br/>
 After parking in the parking lot at Groh park, locate the playset.   <br/>
Proceed on the trail by the playground.  You will come to the picnic shelter. <br/>
 See that garbage can?   Go to it and take a reading of 90 degrees.   Go <br/>
forward 14 paces along the paved trail.   STOP.....Take a reading of 180 <br/>
degrees South.   Continue 11 paces on this trail.  Hopefully you have read <br/>
your compass correctly.  What you are looking for is 6 paces from the trail <br/>
in a tree that looks like a Kings Throne (its actually a rotton tree that <br/>
snapped in half).  Look carefully  for  it is camoflauged.   Stamp in.   <br/>
Please replace as found.   Would love to hear from you if your hunt was <br/>
successful (or even if it wasn't) ameliapezgirl@aol.com<br/>
 Note:  Team Jedi's Force Box #1 and Stamp By Me are both in this park.  Be <br/>
sure to dig up those clues for more letterboxing fun!<br/>
