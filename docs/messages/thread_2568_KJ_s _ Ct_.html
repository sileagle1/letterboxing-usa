wek so much more time to play. I had been in once to ask about it but <br/>
the owner wasn't in and althought the clerk knew it was missing she <br/>
wasn't able to be more helpful in finding out if they would like to <br/>
try again. Then it got slid to the back burner. I do so try to avoid <br/>
ice cream shops while dieting.  But I'll order a diet coke and get <br/>
there hopefully this week. <br/>
