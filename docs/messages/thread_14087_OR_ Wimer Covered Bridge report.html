<br/>
We had seen the box was missing but went to look for it anyway.  There were a couple of cars that went over while we were under there and it was strange to hear them thumping and creaking overhead.  I briefly thought about what would happen if it collapsed while a car was going over us but I shrugged it off as 'never gonna happen'.  Now, 12 days later... <shudder><br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of sites that have pictures of the collapsed bridge.  It's pretty much gone. The whole span collapsed.<br/>
