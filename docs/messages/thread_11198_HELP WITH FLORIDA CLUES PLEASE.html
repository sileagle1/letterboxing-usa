I am leaving Monday morning for Florida &amp; was hoping to letterbox <br/>
while down there.  None of the links for the clues in FL seem to be <br/>
working.  Does anyone know how I can get the clues I am looking for?  <br/>
I am going to Ft Lauderdale, the Keys, and the Everglades.<br/>
<br/>
thank you very much!<br/>

If the webmasters copy the files back in a way that the dates on them <br/>
