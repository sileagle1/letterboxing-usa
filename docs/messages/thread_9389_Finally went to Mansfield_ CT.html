                    <html><body>Greetings,<br/>
<br/>
With the approaching snows only a day away that threatened our planned letterboxing on Thanksgiving, we took off today to beat the weather, and finally went to Mansfield, CT, after a quick stop or three in Coventry. Today's haul is our best yet. Twenty-two boxes in all! They are, in order:<br/>
<br/>
Women of the Revolutionary War Series (1-5): Excellent series of boxes. Some of Irish Timker's best work, at least that we've seen. :-) No problems here.<br/>
<br/>
Pumped Up: Add-on to the Revolutionary Women. Nice and quick, everything in great shape.<br/>
<br/>
Charter Oak's Great Grandson: What a wonderful old tree! We'll have to come back and visit when he's got leaves. Lots of visitors here. No problems to report.<br/>
<br/>
Cindy's Swimming Hole: Took us a minute to realize that we'd driven up to this one from the wrong direction, which threw us off just a bit, but other than that everything was fine.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Lemist Titcomb: Easy in, easy out. Can't wait to tell one of my professors, who is also one of the head librarians, about this box. I'm sure she already knows the story. &lt;g&gt; From here, we finally went to Mansfield.....<br/>
<br/>
Got Milk?: Very nice view, as advertised. Lots of visitors here. In fact, nearly every logbook in Mansfield is full nearly to bursting, and some boxes are on their second or third book!<br/>
<br/>
Music to My Ears: Got in and out without any of the kids (or teachers) noticing.<br/>
<br/>
John Storrs: This one was really dodgy. Felt really exposed, even sitting in the car to stamp in. Very imaginative hiding place, though. This trait is common to a lot of the Mansfield boxes. I understand now how you guys have managed to put so many boxes in such a small area.<br/>
<br/>
Southeast School: This box had a little bit of dampness in it. The logbook wasn't too bad, so we dried it off as best as we could, and tried to reseal the box better.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Birthday: This box gave us the best view we had all day. Very nice spot.<br/>
<br/>
Goodnight, Moon: Cool little stamp. Wonder what this place will look like when they finish whatever it is that they're doing......<br/>
<br/>
Lions Club Park Soccer Field: The highlight of the day! We got our first exchange!!! Melissa and Max were out for a quick stroll. :::Waving to Melissa!::: Met them on our way out. Of all the days to finally meet someone on the trail.....it was the one we least expected!<br/>
<br/>
Mansfield Centre General Store: Stopped in for a late lunch/early supper. Is this one of the coolest places ever or what? :-)<br/>
<br/>
Mother/Daughter: This logbook is getting very full. Other than that, no problems.<br/>
<br/>
Opening Day: With daylight starting to disappear, we practically ran to this one! Best find of the day goes to our son Duncan, who, as we were walking down the trail towards the box, stopped right next to the box and pointed right at it's hiding spot, before the last part of the clues had been read. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ye Olde Cemetary: Light nearly gone now, so thankfully this one was easy to find. Another logbook that was getting really full at this one.<br/>
<br/>
Plane Spotter: Cool story. With light mostly gone, we were very happy this one was so simple. Going to have to make sure to come back to the Historical Society when we can actually go inside. Oh well.....next time!<br/>
<br/>
KJ's Best: This store is a letterboxer's dream. 'Nuf said. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Only one complaint. All day in the middle of letterbox heaven, and no HHs? You're slipping, Mansfield! Might have to bring one along next time........<br/>
