is frozen solid and the ink is watery (although still usable. It has <br/>
obviously taken on water...godd thing it is a beaver : ) I could not find <br/>
box 2 although I did not have a compass with me so I could have been looking <br/>
in the wrong place. Hard to tell sometimes with all this snow! Nor did I <br/>
find #3 but I was coming from the opposite direction so I may have been way <br/>
off course on that one.<br/>
