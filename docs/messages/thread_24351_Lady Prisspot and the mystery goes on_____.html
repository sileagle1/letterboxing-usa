page tomorrow (whops, today), this is better than my book I had been <br/>
reading. It is yellowing with age as I write. Can't wait to hear what <br/>
the grand dame has to say for herself. She is delightful to read.<br/>
 That gal calling herself footloose, better watch it, with her <br/>
tasteless remarks about my kin. I too am wondering about her now. <br/>
Doesn't sound so mannerly to me. <br/>
