<div>Hi all,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yet another newbie checking in.  My cousin 
told me about this hobby a couple of weeks ago, and I'm hooked.  I live in 
Narragansett, RI, and have so far hit the Viking Ships at Sunrise and Midnight 
on the Moon boxes (I laughed when I read the clue to that one because last 
Spring I was wandering around Black Point with the dog when he started 
pawing at the rocks under a certain scrub pine.  I figured he had some poor 
little critter holed up in there and pulled him off, but having seen the dates 
in the log, I think someone had just replanted the box and he was trying to 
see what they had been up to.  I hope this means he has a nose for 
Rubbermaid!).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyhow, unlike the poor folks in Texas, I find that 
there's a great number of letterboxes to choose from in the RI and nearby CT 
area (thank you, planters!).  My cousin and I both have pretty tight 
schedules, and are trying to choose a few more to start with.  Does anyone 
have suggestions for a couple of "must sees"in the area?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for any feedback.</div>

For a nice quiet walk through a really beautiful park, with some great stamps <br/>
I'd suggest Hour of the Olympics.  I'm not sure if you are your normal RIer, <br/>
but it is in the northern region of the state. ;-)  Might take you 45 minutes <br/>
to get there.  <br/>
<br/>
Or if you don't mind steep hills Sin &amp; Flesh Brook was a great walk as well <br/>
<br/>
There is also the Minimalist Series which was a beautiful walk and a very <br/>
entertaining and creative series.  It's amazing how many great stamps there <br/>
are in RI alone.  Good Luck and Happy Boxing<br/>

I guess I'm not a truely "normal" RIer.  After all, I've been know to drive<br/>
"all the way to Burlingame", as a few shocked friends would put it, just to<br/>
run the dog in the winter.  (These same friends, of course, think nothing of<br/>
driving  past Burlingame to get to Foxwoods casino.)  I guess I could handle<br/>
driving to the far northern reaches of the state, but I should probably pack<br/>
emergency rations.  :&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestions!<br/>
<br/>

approximately 25 <br/>
&gt; letterboxes in that area alone!  I'm SO excited!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Pam in CT, going to RI<br/>
<br/>
Here's one for you:<br/>
<br/>
Westerly Woods Town Forest Westerly, RI<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty:  This is an easy two-mile stroll through the town of<br/>
Westerly's forest.  The trail winds through the north slope of the<br/>
town's highest elevation, Mount Moriah.  It has a few trails that wind<br/>
through the woods and under power lines.  There are sections that can<br/>
be muddy in the spring or after rain.  It is a fun but not<br/>
particularly technical area for mountain bikes.<br/>
<br/>
Directions:  From I-95 take exit 92 in CT if northbound.  Go left off<br/>
the exit and head up to Rt. 184.  Turn right on Rt. 184 and continue<br/>
up to the top of a large hill where you will see Boombridge Road on<br/>
your right.  Turn right on Boombridge Road.  From I-95 southbound take<br/>
exit 93 in CT and turn right.  You will have to take an immediate left<br/>
onto Rt. 184.  Go up the large hill past McDonalds and the motel and<br/>
turn left onto Boombridge at the top of the hill.<br/>
<br/>
Continue on the windy country road past an historic farm, crossing<br/>
over the Pawcatuck River until you reach a four-way intersection. <br/>
Turn left at the intersection onto Potter Hill Rd.  Take the second<br/>
left onto Laurel Road.  Laurel resembles a paved driveway with lots of<br/>
houses off of it.  Shortly after the road turns to gravel you will see<br/>
the parking area for the Westerly Woods on the left<br/>
<br/>
Clues:  The trail begins at the east side of the parking lot and is<br/>
marked with a blue blaze.  A few feet into the trail turn left at the<br/>
 "T" and head towards the powerlines.  You will come into an open<br/>
section under the powerlines that slopes down to the right.  At the<br/>
four way intersection under the power lines go straight (north)<br/>
towards the woods.  The trail will gently slope down before curving<br/>
left and going uphill again.  Shortly after the trail starts to rise<br/>
you will go through a stone wall and hit a "T".  Turn right (east)<br/>
along the stonewall and start heading back down hill again.  Continue<br/>
down the trail but keep alert for a sharp left turn in the trail. <br/>
This will be indicated by a white arrow marked on a rock; if you keep<br/>
straight the trail will quickly peter out so you will have to backtrack.<br/>
<br/>
This next section of the trail winds downhill and can be wet, muddy<br/>
and washed out after wet weather.  You will come to a large blowdown<br/>
that you will have to climb through.  The path will cross a small<br/>
streambed with a slightly larger stream off to the right.  The trail<br/>
heads right (north) through a stonewall.  After crossing over small<br/>
corduroy by the stream there will be another split.  Keep heading<br/>
straight.  At the next "T" turn right (60o).  The trail will cross the<br/>
stream here.  When we planted the letterbox the skunk cabbages were<br/>
just coming out, the troutlilies were getting ready to bloom and there<br/>
were three wild turkeys just on the other side.  <br/>
<br/>
The trail becomes a washed out path as it starts to head uphill.  It<br/>
goes through a break in a small, broken down stone wall where you will<br/>
find the Westerly Woods letterbox.  Look to your right (west).  It is<br/>
hidden under the first rock to the south.  After stamping in continue<br/>
on the path as it heads up hill.  Ignore the small trails coming in<br/>
from either side of the path.  The trail will curve left and dip down<br/>
slightly after which you will see another trail coming in from the<br/>
left with an opening in the woods and a red house off in the distance.<br/>
 Keep going straight on the trail you are on.  <br/>
<br/>
You will come to what is almost a three way intersection with an early<br/>
split to the right.  Take the middle trail, keeping parallel to the<br/>
powerlines that will be off to the left.  When you finally come to a<br/>
"T" go left and follow the trail under the powerlines up towards the<br/>
top of the hill.  There will be a four way intersection shortly before<br/>
the top of the hill.  A left (south) turn will take you back to your<br/>
waiting vehicle.<br/>

That is a good hike, and you're right: it can be very muddy and washed out<br/>
but it probably isn't at this time.  Bring your most potent bug repellant,<br/>
Pam, if you choose this one.<br/>

I live near Matunuck and have done nearly all the boxes in our area.  <br/>
The ones I think are real neat are:  Hills are Alive on the South <br/>
County bike path (starts at the Kingston train station.) If you do <br/>
this on a bike it is a breeze.  The other series that has the best <br/>
stamps and "feel" to it is the Wizard of Oz in Carolina Mgt Area.  <br/>
The Oz series is long so you may want to split that into 2 trips.  <br/>
The third one I would recommend is the Day of the Dragon King (I <br/>
think that is what it is called) in Burlingame. Actually, all the <br/>
Burlingame Hikes are nice.   Bug spray highly recommended for all <br/>
these hikes.<br/>

Trouble is, they ALL sound cool, so it's nice to have a little help on where<br/>
to start.  It will be fun to see how many of these I've walked right by in<br/>
the past without knowing what I was missing!<br/>
