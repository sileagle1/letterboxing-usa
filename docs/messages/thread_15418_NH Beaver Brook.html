                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'll admit that I didn't search the archives before my trip to find <br/>
the note from July 9 repeated below. I figured I had one free day in <br/>
southern NH, picked some titles at random, and eventually picked the <br/>
Beaver Brook clues as appearing to be a walk I would like for that <br/>
day. I was rushed before leaving and barely got the clues printed <br/>
with no time to search the archives.<br/>
<br/>
It was a nice walk anyway. But the note from Beaver Brook Park was <br/>
recieved three weeks before my trip and six weeks ago total. Why are <br/>
the clues to these boxes unaltered to reflect that these boxes were <br/>
confiscated by the park staff? The boxes are on the unclaimed list. I <br/>
appreciate that the webmasters leave clues unedited, but a land <br/>
manager announced that he confiscated the boxes. I believe that's a <br/>
situation (and perhaps the only situation) where they should step in <br/>
and edit/delete clues to reflect this, especially when the placer is <br/>
not present to do it themselves. The land manager was clear that he <br/>
didn't want letterboxers off trail in those areas. There shouldn't <br/>
have been any information available that contradicted this. I realize <br/>
that our webmasters are volunteers who already have done a huge <br/>
amount for our sport, but I feel this is a case where they should <br/>
have stepped in and made the corrections, for the sake of the sport <br/>
and relations with this park (and other parks that this manager <br/>
shares info with).<br/>
<br/>
I realize that I should have known better than to not check the <br/>
archives, but plenty of letterboxers aren't maillst members and do <br/>
not have access to the message archive, nor the new database, nor <br/>
know of these resources. Please consider some action on the Beaver <br/>
Brook clues. If really neccesary, I'll "adopt" them for the purpose <br/>
of posting the park's note in place of the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Happy letterboxing.<br/>

&gt; I am the Executive Director of Beaver Brook Association. I was <br/>
&gt; recently alerted to the fact that your site lists two letterbox <br/>
&gt; locations on our property. Although we are not opposed to this <br/>
&gt; activity on our property, these particular locations were not <br/>
&gt; approved by our organization. Unfortunately this is fastly becoming <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; frequent problem. Our land is open to the public, but it is private <br/>
&gt; and any use other than the usual passive recreation activities need <br/>
&gt; to be OK'd with staff. Please alert the people who placed these <br/>
&gt; letterboxes that they will be removed and can be picked up at our <br/>
&gt; office. We will gleadly work with them to determine a mutually <br/>
&gt; beneficial site.<br/>

I have spoken to the Beaver Brook director about adopting or replacing both <br/>
boxes. They are giving "time" for the owners to step forward. The locations <br/>
need to be modified for their approval. Not my boxes so I cannot modify the <br/>
clues-- A problem??<br/>
I plan to place a new box there shortly, provided the location is first <br/>
approved by the director. <br/>
Apparently a large stand of sumac was destroyed by a geocache box placement. <br/>
Searchers did not stay on trails--they bushwhacked through. Not nice!<br/>
I was in your area earlier this summer--VA Beach. I, too, came up short on my <br/>
search due to a missing box not so listed. Frustrating but --the locations <br/>
are great to see anyway. <br/>
Better luck next time.<br/>

I hope that you will adopt the boxes (after there has been time for <br/>
the original owners to come forward) <br/>
I am sick of this politically correct tippy-toeing around abandoned <br/>
letterboxes. IF a box is placed and the person has not maintained it <br/>
in a year and their email address is no longer valid, then I feel <br/>
that they have ABANDONED the letterbox!!! Let's get on with it! There <br/>
are those of us who are ACTIVE in this hobby and we would be happy to <br/>
maintain the letterboxes. If you are not an active letterboxer, then <br/>
LET IT GO.<br/>
