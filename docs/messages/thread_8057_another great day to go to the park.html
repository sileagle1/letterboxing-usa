                    <html><body>found the following boxes today:   Whistle Stop, Out on a Limb, Past lives II and Past lives III.   All in great shape EXCEPT out on a limb.   Took me awhile to find this box (just wasn't looking in the right spot) .   Unfortunately it had water damage to the log.   didn't get to stamp in but loved the stamp in the letterbox.   Just thought I would pass this along.   I'll look it up later and let the owner know about its condition.   My new puppy is totally exhausted and luckily for me I may have a peaceful evening. LOL.   Hope everyone had a great letterboxing weekend<br/>
