                    <div class="plaintext-content">The whole sitrep thing has really been twisted and taken out of <br/>
context.  What began as a all-in-fun exchange between a few people, <br/>
all of whom have been around the list for a while and found <br/>
themselves wondering "what on earth is a sitrep" evidently struck a <br/>
nerve with others and the defensive posts began to fly.  Call your <br/>
post a sitrep, or an LBA or an update or whatever you want, just so <br/>
people understand what the heck you are talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the whole issue of what is okay to post and what is <br/>
not.  Of course this is the place to post about missing or damaged <br/>
boxes.  It is the place to discuss and ask questions about carving, <br/>
containers and clues.  It is the place for newbies to ask questions <br/>
and tell us about their first boxes found and placed.  It is the <br/>
place to gush about a really cool location or stamp or letterbox.  It <br/>
is the place to tell us what color socks you wear while you <br/>
letterbox.  But just to set the record straight, the original intent <br/>
of this list was for discussion all things related to letterboxing; <br/>
it was not meant to be a clearinghouse of boxing reports.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody ever said any of these things were off-limits or discouraged, <br/>
and nobody's posts are of any more value than the next person's <br/>
posts.  But it is still the individual responsibility of each member <br/>
to use discretion in deciding what to share with the group.  Face it, <br/>
not every letterboxing trip, not every letterbox you find is a <br/>
newsworthy experience.  In those situations it is probably a better <br/>
placed effort to e-mail the placer than to post to the list.<br/>
<br/>
What I have found the most discouraging watching the posts the past <br/>
couple of days is that what began as a few people openly expressing <br/>
their points of view has come down to name calling, particularly by a <br/>
few newer members.  While it is understandable that not everyone will <br/>
see things the same way, this is an open list and anyone should feel <br/>
free to post their questions or perspectives on things without being <br/>
ridiculed.  We have not resorted to calling you snot-nosed newbies, <br/>
so please refrain from calling us grumps, grouches and sourpusses.<br/>
<br/>
And as for the grumps "getting out and going letterboxing a little <br/>
more..."  Those are awfully big words from a relative newbie to folks <br/>
who have found and placed hundreds of boxes and each personally <br/>
played a part in shaping the direction of the hobby.  Or perhaps you <br/>
weren't aware of that because they don't feel the need to post a <br/>
sitrep every time they find a box.<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that the majority of objections and vocal posts <br/>
are coming from newer members of the group, while all of the <br/>
supportive and encouraging e-mail I have received has been from folks <br/>
who have been around here for a while.<br/>
<br/>
We are not alientating the newbies, they seem to be doing a pretty <br/>
good job of that themselves.<br/>
