Thanks for the report.  Of the 8 boxes, 7 are mine!  I'm so glad you <br/>
found all the Dead Authors because I thought I was going to have to <br/>
rewrite the clues to #3 and #4.  You've proved these boxes are <br/>
findable so the other folks who couldn't find them the first time <br/>
should try, try again.<br/>
