the winter holidays! Pete finally got our Thanksgiving report up on <br/>
our webpage last week. It's at(let's hope I get it right this time!):<br/>
<br/>
 http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/Letterboxes.html<br/>
(left side of page - Turkeys, Pickles and Peanuts)<br/>
<br/>
We also have our Texas trip report up from October, and some people <br/>
might even be interested in reading my "summer burnout" report from <br/>
somewhat earlier( not those with "weak stomachs", though, since it's <br/>
not my usual "cheery self", but from a time when I was rather down <br/>
on stamp collecting gatherings and letterboxing, so please bear in <br/>
mind that I may not yet have fully recovered!:-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I also wanted to note that we've added Franzsolo to our 2006 <br/>
LA-LA list! We still remember noting at one point in 2002 that Ohio <br/>
was almost rivaling Connecticut for greatest number of letterboxes - <br/>
due largely to his efforts - so we knew he'd be up for a "lil' <br/>
Oscar" soon, but it turns out he already has his 5 years in as of <br/>
this fall, so special thanks to Franzsolo for his groundbreaking <br/>
work in spreading letterboxing across Ohio, too! <br/>
<br/>
Now, what with cooking and baking for church bazaars and dinners, <br/>
making costumes for Christmas pageants, caroling at nursing homes, <br/>
dance parties, etc. I won't have much time left for letterboxing <br/>
lately - or even getting on a computer again perhaps - so I'll take <br/>
this time to wish you all "Happy Holidays"!(complete with turkeys, <br/>
pickles and peanuts!)<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
