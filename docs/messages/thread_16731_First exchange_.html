Maybe in-betweenies?  LOL  <br/>
Anyway, we've only been boxing since this July and have only had two <br/>
on-trail exchanges. The rest were at a gathering. We were extremely <br/>
excited about our first exchange though. All of us were as giddy as <br/>
teenagers at an Elvis concert. LOL  We can relate to your <br/>
excitement. :)  <br/>
Congratulations on your first exchange and here's to many more!<br/>
Keep on boxin',<br/>

&gt; I know to all you oldbies this may not be exciting news, but I got <br/>
&gt; my first exchange yesterday when we ran into the Mobots looking for <br/>

<br/>
This is so exciting. We have never brokered an exchange. We feel like yentas!<br/>
Hopefully someday we'll run into you two on the trail.<br/>
By the way, we're going to be planting a new series very soon. So watch for the<br/>
announcement for Turkey Trot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the way, I think I deserve some sort of prize for <br/>
&gt; multitasking....I was, on this little excursion: (1) getting the <br/>

&gt; around after the kids," which all moms do!); and (4) letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
And you definitely get the prize for Supermom! <br/>
Happy boxing -<br/>
gg (still waiting for their first exchange)<br/>
