                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't spend a lot of time here anymore largely because I got tired <br/>
of wading through the huge volumes of whining and negativity but as I <br/>
was scanning the digests the other day I was struck by the parellels <br/>
between this and another list I was once on.  I thought I'd share <br/>
what happened there as fodder for a (hopefully) positve discussion <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago I purchased a vintage Mercedes Benz and seeking <br/>
technical advice I joined the Mercedes Benz Club of America.  At the <br/>
time they had a largely unmoderated email group much like this one.  <br/>
It was wonderful.  There were people from all walks of life <br/>
discussing all manner of subjects in addition to discussing the <br/>
cars.  Then the list was more or less hijacked by a small number of <br/>
malcontents who apparently had little else to do all day but bury <br/>
everyones inboxes in torrents of trash few wanted to read.  Many got <br/>
disgusted and left before the Club powers that be finally pulled the <br/>
plug.  Eventually the Club re-established an internet presence with a <br/>
series of tightly focused, highly moderated forums.  The intellectual <br/>
freedom and variety is gone and the last time I looked hardly anyone <br/>
used them.  A few months later however, a couple of the most <br/>
respected members of the old list formed a private discussion group.  <br/>
Anyone can join but they must first read and agree to a few very <br/>
simple rules.  Among them: No one may use profanity at any time, no <br/>
one may criticize what anyone else chooses to post about - variety of <br/>
topics is encouraged, no one may disrespect any other list member.  <br/>
The rules are simple but they are absolutely enforced.  Any <br/>
infraction judged by the list owner to be deliberate brings immediate <br/>
banishment for life.  No appeals, no discussion - just blasted into <br/>
the cyber netherworld by the mighty Pooferator.  This list is <br/>
populated by diverse, intelligent people who have a wonderful time <br/>
discussing everything you can imagine as well as their cars.  Newbies <br/>
who ask questions that have been asked a thousand times before are <br/>
politely directed to the list archives.  It is the very best of what <br/>
an internet email group can be.  Would something similar work for <br/>
this group?  I don't know.  Most of the few here who have the respect <br/>
and standing to wield the pooferator probably don't have the time or <br/>
the inclination.  I don't have any magic bullets - just sharing what <br/>
I have observed elsewhere.  Just get out there and box!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another option might be to start a newsgroup.  In the newsgroup format, the <br/>
messages reside on a central server and don't end up clogging up our individual <br/>
mail boxes.  The newsgroup posts are archived and easily searchable.  Also <br/>
it's easier to follow the thread of a conversation, as all replies to posts are <br/>
linked.<br/>
<br/>
The moderated option is a good suggestion, but some folks are concerned with <br/>
the editing (or censorship) of posts.  On a newsgroup, you can skip what you <br/>
don't have time for and return to it later.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts from a Newbie.<br/>
