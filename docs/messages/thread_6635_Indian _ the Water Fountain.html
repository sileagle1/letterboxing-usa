    Since the boxes are in need of repair, and the owner has yet to <br/>
speak up for them, we are going to adopt this series.  We will wait 1 <br/>
week to remove the boxes, just in case the owner has missed all of <br/>
the previous discussions about them.  If we do not hear from anyone <br/>
before Saturday, 8/10, we will adopt the boxes and remove them that <br/>
day for repair.  We don't mind taking on these boxes, but don't want <br/>
to step on any toes.  So if they are yours and you would prefer us <br/>
not to do so, please contact us on the talk list or at our email.  <br/>
Speak now or forever hold your peace.  We will post again before we <br/>
remove the boxes, so no one makes any fruitless trips.  We will post <br/>
when they are returned and add any corrections in the directions, as <br/>
they are doing upkeep on the park.<br/>
