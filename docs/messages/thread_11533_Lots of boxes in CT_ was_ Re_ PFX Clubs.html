active with LB I'm realizing how the CT/MA/RI area is almost a <br/>
letterboxing mecca.  Our first letterboxing experience was attending <br/>
the '02 Kids Day Gathering with Patrick, Amy, and Ruth last October <br/>
(the weekend after our honeymoon) and we managed to get somewhere <br/>
around F25 X48 and now that I am seeing comments like the one below, <br/>
I'm kind of amazed.<br/>
   Of course I wish we had more time to go out and visit areas like <br/>
Mansfield and others that are quite saturated with boxes, but <br/>
unfortunately I work a rotating work schedule and it makes life <br/>
difficult to spend time together at home let alone finding time to go <br/>
hiking for a day (Patrick and Amy can appreciate this).  I have no <br/>
clue where I'm going with this other than the fact that we're very <br/>
happy to have discovered this hobby and feel very fortunate to have <br/>
such a great following and participation [of LB] in Connecticut!  <br/>
Thanks to Pete and Wanda, Chuck and Molly, Butterfly, Bluebird, and <br/>
all the others who have placed so many boxes and afforded everyone <br/>
the chance to go exploring!!!!!  <br/>
   Hopefully we'll be on the PFX100 list very soon!<br/>
<br/>
Steve and Heidi (and Madras of course....)<br/>
<br/>
PS - There's going to be a birthday greetings HH placed Sunday <br/>
weather pending.... Heidi's turning 25 that day!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;      You guys in CT can get an easy 20 in a day! The rest of the <br/>
&gt; country is lucky to get 20 in a month. Please make a "PFX100Club" <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; least. At the rate I'm going I'll be lucky to get to 500 in 3 <br/>
years. <br/>
