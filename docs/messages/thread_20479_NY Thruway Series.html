awe!<br/>
<br/>
If you have yet to visit the Western NY region, here's a reason! <br/>
Interstate 90, the New York Thruway, has 8 of the best boxes we've <br/>
ever SEEN between Buffalo and Syracuse! We were so impressed with the <br/>
two we found, we must have giggled like school kids for 10 minutes in <br/>
the car at each one. We can't wait to take a trip further east to get <br/>
the rest. <br/>
<br/>
The Elba Onions are an ingenious group that's responsible for a good <br/>
portion of the boxes in the Western New York area, including a some <br/>
great historic cemetary series', so it's no wonder they're at it <br/>
again giving us a great search while teaching us local history. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's another reason to visit...come on out for pizza, wings <br/>
and a little letterboxing!<br/>
