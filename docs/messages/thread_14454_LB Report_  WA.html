in western Washington.  There is much to see and do, but<br/>
this time we concentrated on Mt. Ranier and the San Juan<br/>
Islands, one of our favorite places to visit and escape<br/>
the Texas summer.  Though my wife is a non-letterboxer,<br/>
I snuck in a few finds and even hid one on Orcas Island<br/>
(just missed being the first by a few weeks).  Here is<br/>
a list of the boxes I attempted and their status:<br/>
