Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I stumbled across one of your caches on grizzly peak blvd the other<br/>
day and was curious about it and what kind of "game" it might be.<br/>
I might want to get involved.  Could you please tell me about it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Terry<br/>

(The letterbox in question is my Fish Ranch, which is at the top of<br/>
the Berkeley Hills, overlooking all of Berkeley and Oakland, the Bay<br/>
Bridge, the San Francisco Bay, and the Golden Gate Bridge.  I love<br/>
this letterbox, and am quite proud of the stamp.  So, I wrote back)<br/>
<br/>
Wow!  How did you "stumble" on that?  Were you falling down the<br/>
hill, or what?<br/>
<br/>
What you found is a letterbox, which is the grandfather of geocaching.<br/>
 Letterboxing goes back to Victorian England, and is very active in<br/>
the US, particularly in the Bay Area.<br/>
<br/>
How it works is that you go out, armed with clues, a personal<br/>
rubberstamp (usually hand carved), an ink pad, and a logbook.  When<br/>
you find the letterbox (as you did), you make an impression of the<br/>
stamp that you found in the hidden box in your personal logbook, and<br/>
you print your personal stamp in the hidden logbook.  Then you replace<br/>
everything just the way you found it.  Simple!<br/>
<br/>
For example, this is the clue for the letterbox you found:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=11980<br/>
<br/>
Please drop me a note, and let me know that everything you found is<br/>
still intact in the hidden box.  I'm very fond of my little fish ranch<br/>
girl and wouldn't want her to get lost!<br/>
<br/>
Other letterboxes nearby can be found at:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/results.html?gTypeId=3;gCity=Berkeley,CA,US<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

(Not an hour later, this came in.)<br/>
<br/>
I found it when I was trying to get a better look at a bashful lizard.<br/>
 He ran into the hole and when I moved a piece of bark to look in I<br/>
found your little container.  We left you a note and then put it back<br/>
like we found it.<br/>
<br/>
We figured out the gist of the game and the stamps on our own. We<br/>
thought that the location might have something to do with the nice<br/>
view and wondered if other caches might be located where there are<br/>
nice views.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to go check out the website now, we may join the game.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Terry<br/>
***********************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
(To which I replied)<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxers do try to share special places with strangers, so, yes,<br/>
you'll find other great views if you go hunting letterboxes.  A good<br/>
one is Volcano by the letterboxer who calls herself Blackbird.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who sticks their hands into dark places chasing lizards is<br/>
already cool in<br/>
my book!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the note!<br/>

Robb and I happened to be up in the hills that afternoon, hunting a<br/>
letterbox, so we took the opportunity to swing by Fish Ranch.  Terry<br/>
had done a wonderful drawing of two intertwined fish, leaping over the<br/>
ocean, under the watchful eyes of a smiling sun.  There was a very<br/>
nice note, and everything was perfectly hidden.<br/>
<br/>
How delightful is that?<br/>

That's such a great story!  As one who has found your Fish Ranch box,<br/>
I have to say it's probably the last box of the ones I've found that I<br/>
would ever expect someone to randomly find.  I might have thought<br/>
accidental finder's email would go more like... "Hi, I stumbled upon<br/>
