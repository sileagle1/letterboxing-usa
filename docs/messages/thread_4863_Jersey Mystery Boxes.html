<br/>We visited the site of Panic/Attack but knew from the info on the clues page that it was no longer there.

<br/>Thanks, All.  We not only had fun hiking in new places, we learned a few things, too.

Thanks for the update on the boxes! On my free days, I'd rather be out finding <br/>
new boxes, so I never seem to get around to checking up on the ones I've <br/>
planted.<br/>
<br/>
It's good to hear that the Mooving Tale box is still there--the area is quickly <br/>
being built up with overpriced houses!<br/>
