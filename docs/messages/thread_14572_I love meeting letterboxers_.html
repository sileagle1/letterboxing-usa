having a ball this month meeting several!  Life is rich sometimes!<br/>
<br/>
I never really had a chance to comment on our Idaho gathering last week.  It<br/>
was just delightful for me, even if we just had our small group.  What a<br/>
nice switch it is to have other people around that are every bit as obsessed<br/>
as I am!  How nice to be able to get excited and ask others questions about<br/>
how this has affected their hiking, how do they carve, what supplies do they<br/>
like, etc, and not get blank stares or that "that sounds like a really nice<br/>
hobby for you" speech.<br/>
<br/>
Don and Gwen and I made one discovery that was funny.  They were looking<br/>
around my town for a spot that they thought would make a good letterbox<br/>
hiding spot.  When they found one they really liked, they reached down, and<br/>
low and behold, there they found one of my letterboxes!  Now, Idaho isn't<br/>
swimming in boxes yet, so the chances of this happening are not very good.<br/>
I just got a kick out of that.<br/>
<br/>
Today, I made a short drive to Blackfoot as I had heard that Amanda/the<br/>
Paisley Orca was coming down for a family reunion and that she wouldn't mind<br/>
meeting for an exchange.  I had to laugh as I came walking up to the crowd<br/>
at her family reunion and I asked for Amanda.  Immediately her relatives<br/>
asked me, "are you one of those letterboxing friends?"  I guess our<br/>
reputation preceeds me :-)  I was directed to the pavilion and it wasn't too<br/>
hard to guess who I was looking for when I saw a woman surrounded by a<br/>
backpack, notepads, and carving materials carving  stamps for respective<br/>
children. (I now have blue bunnies stamped on both my arms from one of the<br/>
little girls there.)  Well it was great talking to her for a while, and I<br/>
was happy to find that she wasn't the only letterboxer there as I got to<br/>
meet and exchange with Moronie too (woo hoo, double the pleasure, double the<br/>
fun!).  Now if this exchange isn't proof of an addiction, not much else is.<br/>
Who would choose to invade a family reunion of a bunch of people you've<br/>
never even met just to get a stamp or two?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now I'm getting a bit cheesy, but this has just been a blast!  While I<br/>
was down there I found two of the boxes that had been planted during the<br/>
trip up to our little gathering by Don and Gwen and A &amp; J Bear.  "Mr. Potato<br/>
Head" cracked me up, and I just loved "Gotta Go," planted at an interpretive<br/>
trail off of a local rest stop.  Yesterday, I hit "Early Hunters" and I will<br/>
go back for "Last of the Elephant Hunters."  I am just having so much fun.<br/>
When I first started this last Spring, there were only two boxes for<br/>
hundreds of miles.  There still aren't other letterboxers in this side of<br/>
the state, but there are nibbles and the boxes are coming.  I'm glad I<br/>
discovered this in the early stages.  It is fun to watch it growing.  Plus I<br/>
keep saying that the fun thing about being the only letterboxer around (for<br/>
now) is that nearly all of my finds are counted as first finds.  I have to<br/>
look for the positives.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting,<br/>
