Well, ya know, even *Hillary* actually made it into<br/>
the Adirondacks though she very vocally stated her<br/>
unmitigated hate of the imfamous Black Flies and that<br/>
she'd never visit because of them. ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I have to be completely truthful, though, and proclaim<br/>
my complete distaste (literally, as they seem to love<br/>
to congregate in my oft-times open mouth, ick!)for the<br/>
creature, as well.<br/>
<br/>
That aside--I would love to see more boxes planted<br/>
there and if I can get motivated I just might get to<br/>
work on a few.<br/>
<br/>
AD-<br/>
who is sure her mother is reading right now and<br/>
rolling her eyes at her peculiar daughter! lol<br/>
