A few years back there was a similar(not the same topic) occurance and <br/>
in that post the writer gave a few more clues to their identity. I was <br/>
able to track them down to a "Gamers" site. The site had several <br/>
players posting their results about how successful they had been in <br/>
developing their personas. They played games with various groups and <br/>
actually counted their conquests as we would count our 'finds'. <br/>
Stirring the pot on a letterboxers site could be considered as a count.<br/>

I have no reason to believe that Joy Kelley's post was from a gamer as <br/>
I haven't really tried to track it down, but the timing and limited <br/>
information included is a bit suspect.<br/>
<br/>
Targeting game playing letterboxers could certainly be high on a <br/>
conquest list? If it is legitimate then there should be more info forth <br/>
coming. Naming the charitable organization would be just the start.<br/>
