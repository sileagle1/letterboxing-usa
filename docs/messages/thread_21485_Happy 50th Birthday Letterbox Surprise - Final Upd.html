                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am sorry for the delay in posting this message.  I just received an<br/>
email response from the birthday boy today.  I will post his friendly and<br/>
appreciative response:<br/>
<br/>
"You are a brat! I am still getting cards from all over the country, I<br/>
just received one 3 days ago. There are some very nice notes in them.<br/>
Thank you for the kind gift and for the time it took to do all that. The<br/>
staff here think I am probably into some sort of pyramid scam.  They were<br/>
amazed at the number of the cards coming from all over. They are probably<br/>
a little nosey also. Thank you very much for thinking of me."<br/>
<br/>
Good news - we are taking "Howard the Builder" out letterboxing in a<br/>
couple of weeks!  We are going to find the PI DAY series together ... look<br/>
for his sig stamp in Wisconsin boxes soon!<br/>
<br/>
I want to publicly thank the following letterboxers who helped make this<br/>
surprise possible:<br/>
<br/>
Barefoot Lucy, Beaded Zebra, Bell Lady, Bookworm, BTTLE_2004, Catpawz,<br/>
celticlions, Corazn, Czeltic Girl, Dancin Feet, Dirt Devil Mama and Dirt<br/>
Devil Daughter, drgdlg of GA, Dynamic Duo, Elm, Daisy and Boo Bear,<br/>
gurudybaker, JACKS, KnitWit, Latin Hibiscus, Leapin' Lizards, Julie L.,<br/>
Longhorn and The Camel, Kokopelli, SpringChick, Miss Moon, Lpfrognmac,<br/>
moonrabbit2, Dorie M., Ms. dragonfli, MTNestRobin, Jay and Amy, old blue &amp;<br/>
doubles aj, Peppermint Patti, Poison Ivy Hedge, RocNRon, Rubaduc, Suzanne<br/>

The Griffins, Trail Troll, Trailside Two, uneksia, Jules in WA  and Andy<br/>

<br/>
If I left your name off, it's because I just copied my address book<br/>
entries.  Some of these cards have multiple stamps for family/team<br/>
members.  I appreciate every exchange I received and they are proudly<br/>
displayed in a special photo album that has a compass design.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails to You,<br/>
