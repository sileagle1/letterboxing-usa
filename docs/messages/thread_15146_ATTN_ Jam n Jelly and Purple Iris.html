<br/>
Have you received any e-mail from us in the past 10 days or so via the LBNA <br/>
"contact the planter" message feature?  We have e-mailed each of you at least <br/>
once during that time.  We just assumed you hadn't replied yet, but now we <br/>
wonder if the "contact the planter" feature isn't working, and you never got our <br/>
messages . . .  This would explain why, though we reported JnJ's Semi Mystery <br/>
Box missing on 8/8, it wasn't officially listed as missing until this week.<br/>
<br/>
Please let us know if you did not get our messages, so we know not to use <br/>
that LBNA feature.<br/>

Hi Doughtnut, Etc.,<br/>
I have not received any message from you. Not even the one about <br/>
Briggs Point. When I post to the SoCal site I just use post and I <br/>
have the mail set to Digest. I think I am getting most of the <br/>
messages that way. <br/>
<br/>
It was nice to meet all of you the other day. Hopefully we can meet <br/>
again sometime. Purple Iris.<br/>

Well, this is an open invitation to anyone interested in letterboxing in Southern California.  I was working my way through the list of planters of SoCal boxes but I guess this way is faster.  : )<br/>
