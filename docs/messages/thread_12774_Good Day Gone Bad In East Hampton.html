So the people who plant boxes can check in from time to time and if they see a problem with one of their boxes they can go out and try to correct it so people don't travel half way across the State for nothing.Almost like the clue list for troubled boxes so the owner of the box can replace things that are missing or adjust the clues if people are having a little problem with it.And once your box is fixed,it can be taken off the troubled list,so others no it's good to go.Just an idea.Lenny/Kathy       <br/>

I had the same problem with this one. Forget looking for a path, <br/>
simply head back over the Viaduct towards East Hampton and look for <br/>
the green pipe along the Airline trail.<br/>
