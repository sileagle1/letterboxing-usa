Priscilla planted 2 'boat boxes' in NJ. At least one of them can be <br/>
reached over land, about 4 1/2 miles to the box by 4x4 or walking. I <br/>
found out yesterday that horses are allowed in that area as well.<br/>
Indeed I did -- The Little Rivers of New Jersey Series.  We've actually <br/>
planted 3, but one (the one that was accessible only by water) was washed away in <br/>
one of the many storms we've had lately.  The clues/drections for the remaining <br/>
2 are only by boat, but if one gets out a map (or knows the area well) he/she <br/>
can probably figure out a way to find it by land.  Although these are not <br/>
visited as frequently as some of the other 'boxes we've hidden, they have gotten <br/>
some visitors.  We have another ready and hope to plant a few more in the <br/>
series.<br/>
