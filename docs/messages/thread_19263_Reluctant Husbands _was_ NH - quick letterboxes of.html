Okay, so you may have already tried that.  There's also the cheap (free!) and easy exercise angle.  Lots of folks, like myself, are bored to tears by running (but have to do it anyway - Thanks Uncle Sam!), but letterboxing gets in the greatest form of exercise known to human physiology: walking.<br/>

  What I should have elaborated on was that we will have a camper in <br/>
  tow.  Most likely I will venture out by myself during the week of <br/>
  vacation.  I am trying (poking, prodding, whatever it takes) to get <br/>
  him to participate in this hobby of mine but without much success.  <br/>
  But thanks for the suggestion....<br/>

My word! What a universal applicability to all of our situations. <br/>
<br/>
This issue is something we have discussed in our family. We may all <br/>
eat together but we need not share the same loaf, if you follow that <br/>
non-Scriptural reference. It is wrong to expect your mate to enjoy <br/>
everything you do. <br/>
<br/>
Men are simpler creatures although given to be the head of the house. <br/>
They have at least three onorous responsibilities: 1) to make <br/>
decisions, 2) to lift heavy objects, and 3) to frighten the children. <br/>
To expect more, when they are already tired from those three and <br/>
working all day in the Walmart or wherever, is just wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Ladies, do not drive your husbands away by insisting on something <br/>
like this. Instead, let him think it is his idea - we all know how to <br/>
do that. Then tell him that you would love to have him take his gun <br/>
along (as long as it is not TOO noticeable) and that you would feel <br/>
eversomuch safer from rattlesnakes, coyotes, and muggers. Make <br/>
certain he can hear his football game on a small pocket radio and <br/>
headphones. Offer to carry his beer (men do seem SO dependent upon <br/>
that) in your letterboxing bag.<br/>
<br/>
Myself, I would rather save arguments and stronger persuasion for <br/>
important things: like that "tennis bracelet" I have been hinting for.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this saves your marriage,<br/>
